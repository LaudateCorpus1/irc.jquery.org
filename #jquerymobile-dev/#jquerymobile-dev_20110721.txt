[09:05:44] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: have you had a chance to take a look at my problem?
[09:40:58] <scottjehl> hey
[09:40:58] <bot-t> (137 hours ago) <gseguin> tell scottjehl: That fixed it. Thank you! You'll have to tell me how you did it.
[09:41:25] <scottjehl> hey gseguin
[09:41:55] <ryanneufeld> hi scott
[09:42:13] <scottjehl> hey there
[09:42:25] <ryanneufeld> I've got a real stumper
[09:42:28] <scottjehl> so, for anyone who missed it, widget decoupling landed yesterday
[09:42:36] <ryanneufeld> cool
[09:42:47] <scottjehl> before https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/3deaa97c3a347a12dc1d076ec48c38ba11853bf3/js/jquery.mobile.page.js after https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/2a6c7fc1b982c4308a0450a308f5a66a10e949cf/js/jquery.mobile.page.js
[09:43:03] <scottjehl> what's up Ryan?
[09:43:06] <ryanneufeld> would that effect this fun problem I' having: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2122
[09:43:15] <ryanneufeld> I can better explain though
[09:43:51] <ryanneufeld> Basically, on alpha 4, the addthis button widget code works great
[09:43:53] <ryanneufeld> on Beta 1
[09:44:13] <ryanneufeld> it's like the click get's intercepted and not passed along to the addthis binding to it
[09:44:16] <scottjehl> k. yeah I'm guessing that was the vclick handling change in b1
[09:44:19] <scottjehl> we've since rolled that back
[09:44:22] <scottjehl> try latest
[09:44:25] <ryanneufeld> I did
[09:44:37] <scottjehl> ok
[09:44:38] <scottjehl> hmm
[09:44:45] <gseguin> scottjehl: I'm back
[09:44:51] <ryanneufeld> I can try again
[09:44:55] <scottjehl> hey gseguin
[09:44:57] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: sorry didn't have time to look into that
[09:45:18] <ryanneufeld> s'ok, I've got scottjehl's attention as well, now :p
[09:45:24] <scottjehl> hmm. this one looks like it'll take some time to dig into
[09:45:33] <scottjehl> I won't have time today, unfortunately
[09:45:38] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, and I need to have it ready to go by today
[09:46:06] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: why don't you roll back to a4 ?
[09:46:18] <ryanneufeld> our live site is on a3
[09:46:25] <ryanneufeld> and seems to work
[09:46:29] <gseguin> scottjehl: what's up? any luck with the transitions?
[09:47:43] <scottjehl> umm. so a click event is not bubbling up? I'm not sure I understand the dilemma
[09:47:51] <scottjehl> gseguin: haven't had a chance
[09:47:55] <gseguin> scottjehl, toddparker: I need a second pair of eyes to make sure I didn't miss anything here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2006#issuecomment-1620171
[09:47:57] <scottjehl> do you want to jump back in on it?
[09:49:04] <gseguin> sure, what's left to do?
[09:49:32] <scottjehl> not sure :) where'd we leave off?
[09:49:39] <gseguin> :)
[09:49:41] <ryanneufeld> scottjehl: yes
[09:49:45] <ryanneufeld> that seems to be what's going on
[09:50:18] <scottjehl> ryanneufeld. maybe try binding your event listener to something lower than the document, if it's a live handler. Maybe delegate off body...?
[09:50:25] <ryanneufeld> not my code
[09:50:56] <gseguin> scottjehl, ryanneufeld: I think the problem is in the addthis code
[09:51:00] <ryanneufeld> http://www.addthis.com/help/client-api
[09:51:18] <ryanneufeld> I'm using addthis.button()
[09:51:30] <ryanneufeld> which binds to whatever you give it as a selector
[09:51:55] <ryanneufeld> for some reason, unknown to me, it doesn't seem to work on a mobile device
[09:52:14] <ryanneufeld> I've been using weinre to try and debug it, but it's slow going
[10:11:46] <ryanneufeld> so, switching to the latest from git has messed up our styles a bi
[10:11:48] <ryanneufeld> *bit
[10:11:58] <ryanneufeld> but still no dice on the clicking
[10:14:17] <toddparker> hi ryanneufield - this room is for the dev team to discuss coding and isn't a support forum
[10:14:34] <toddparker> please hop over to the jquerymobile channel for support, thanks!
[10:14:53] <toddparker> sorry, spelled you handle wrong there ryanneufeld
[10:15:46] <ryanneufeld> toddparker: Thanks, ajpiano recommended I ask in here, as no one responds in the support channel.
[10:17:27] <ajpiano> yeah, ryan is pretty active in doing #jquery support etc... the problem with mobile is as he says, #jquerymobile is very quiet for people who actutally need help
[10:17:54] <ajpiano> so i wanted to put him on front of your eyeballs ;)
[10:23:15] <scottjehl> it's a problem for sure
[10:24:04] <scottjehl> I'm happy to help, unfortunately I don't have time today. Gotta fix something before I leave in an hour
[10:24:48] <ryanneufeld> Thanks scottjehl do you think this something that could be solved at all, even if you had time, by the end of the day today?
[10:25:09] <ryanneufeld> I just gotta let our PM know if I can fix it, or if we have to delay the feature to make the launch
[10:25:16] <scottjehl> well, part of this is I clearly don't understand the problem yet
[10:25:19] <scottjehl> :/
[10:25:37] <scottjehl> at a glance, the code was a little hard to follow
[10:25:44] <ryanneufeld> indeed
[10:26:08] <ryanneufeld> the basic issue is that addthis binds to a click event and I think a mouse over
[10:26:31] <scottjehl> wish I had more time. In general, click events should work as expected with jQM in place. Defaults may be prevented depending on whether the ajax navigation is in play
[10:26:32] <ryanneufeld> and some change since alpha 4 is preventing that click/hover from reaching the handler bound to addthis
[10:26:41] <ryanneufeld> okay
[10:26:42] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[10:26:48] <ryanneufeld> that gives me enough places to look
[10:26:50] <scottjehl> you might try binding to vclick
[10:27:03] <ryanneufeld> it's not my code, and it's minified :S
[10:27:10] <scottjehl> hm
[10:27:13] <ryanneufeld> gonna see if I can get on a chat w/ the addthis guys
[10:27:18] <scottjehl> k
[10:27:23] <scottjehl> good luck! sorry :(
[10:27:37] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[10:27:50] <ryanneufeld> can we schedule a time to look at this together?
[10:28:36] <scottjehl> have you filed a bug in the tracker? Not sure if it's our bug, but it sounds like we may have regressed in a situation we hadn't considered
[10:28:56] <scottjehl> that tends to be the best way for us to help when we have time
[10:29:00] <ryanneufeld> there is a bug, but I can't prove it's your codes fault
[10:29:15] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2122
[10:29:24] <scottjehl> ok
[10:29:59] <ryanneufeld> any how, I won't keep you from your day. I'll take a look at the diff from a4 to current, maybe something will jump out at me
[10:30:04] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[10:34:32] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: if something is obvious let me know and I may be able to help
[10:40:37] <ryanneufeld> Thanks gseguin, appreciate it
[10:41:10] <ryanneufeld> data-theme broken for the entire page in the latest git?
[10:41:46] <gseguin> really?
[10:41:53] <ryanneufeld> seems to be yeah
[10:41:58] <ryanneufeld> we have a custom theme
[10:42:12] <scottjehl> shouldn't be, but it's possible that the default data-role=content theme is being used and that's what you're seeing
[10:42:14] <scottjehl> check the content div
[10:42:18] <ryanneufeld> I had to add the data-theme attr to a couple extra elements
[10:42:22] <scottjehl> you may want to set that option to null
[10:42:45] <ryanneufeld> I have <div data-role="page" data-theme="m">
[10:42:50] <ryanneufeld> and no other set
[10:43:05] <ryanneufeld> b1 it worked, b2 I have to set it on my header and it's contents
[10:44:06] <scottjehl> k. yeah we decoupled header/footer/content from page() so it's possible the defaults flipped a little. Please file a bug and I'll ensure it's consistent with b1
[10:44:20] <ryanneufeld> kk
[10:44:29] <scottjehl> thanks
[10:45:11] <scottjehl> sorry - that decoupling change may have a ripple here and there to work through, but it was very important to push it through before 1.0. We'll stay on top of regressions to make sure b2 matches
[10:45:26] <scottjehl> so far, we've fixed the minor ones that have come in. 2 I think
[10:49:29] <ryanneufeld> s'ok and here's something very strange... now addthis is working for me... very very bizzare
[10:49:43] <ryanneufeld> maybe the ipad caches things more aggressively than I realized
[10:49:43] <gseguin> with latest?
[10:49:45] <ryanneufeld> yes
[10:49:53] <ryanneufeld> it's taking a double tap to trigger though
[10:50:31] <ryanneufeld> that must be the "tap once to hover" thing that safari does on iOS
[10:50:43] <_nickel> scottjehl: meeting in 10 min?
[10:50:48] * _nickel hopes he got it right.
[10:50:55] <gseguin> _nickel: yes
[10:51:15] * _nickel cartwheels out of control with happiness
[10:51:20] <_nickel> awesome
[10:52:02] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: possibly a useFastClick thing?
[10:52:39] <gseguin> possibly
[10:53:02] <ryanneufeld> ahh, a long tap does it
[10:53:04] <ryanneufeld> must be that then
[10:53:21] <ryanneufeld> does fastclick still exisit in the latest
[10:53:22] <ryanneufeld> ?
[10:55:24] <scottjehl> no. that was the roll back to click
[10:55:32] <ryanneufeld> okay
[10:55:34] <ryanneufeld> thx
[10:58:09] <_nickel> scottjehl: I've been meaning to ask this for a while but is there any reason we aren't namespacing our events?
[10:59:21] * _nickel cringes at the thought of another namespaceing discussion
[10:59:40] <ryanneufeld> Hey guys, thanks for taking the time to answer me when you're so busy. I really appreciate it. Also the latest git solves my problem
[10:59:47] <ryanneufeld> I'll update my issue
[11:00:41] <todd_> call over on meeting now
[12:01:03] <_nickel> signing off for now todd_ gseguin if I don't get back online I'll talk with you guys Monday
[12:01:17] <gseguin> alright _nickel
[12:01:35] <gseguin> _nickel: are you going to be in the bay area at some point?
