[07:43:40] <todd__> Hi everyone
[08:01:26] <todd__> jQ mobile is popular here: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/08/developer-survey-results-libraries-and-cross-browser-on-mobile/
[08:21:46] <todd__> johnbender and kinblas - you guys never activated your browserstack accounts…you should look for an email from months ago and grab your account for testing
[10:02:34] <johnbender> todd__: I've got one through adobe]
[10:02:39] <johnbender> *adobe
[10:11:41] <todd__> johnbender: cool
[10:11:49] <todd__> i wish i had this last week for testing
[10:12:20] <todd__> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_ , agcolom - i requested browserstack accounts for you too
[10:12:27] <todd__> how goes johnbender
[10:12:45] <todd__> we should make some decisions on 1.2 today
[10:24:19] <johnbender> toddparker: kk
[10:24:38] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm good, I was going to dive back into the base tag stuff today
[10:24:41] <johnbender> well
[10:24:44] <johnbender> at least disabling it
[10:24:58] <johnbender> my previous solution was unsufficient :(
[10:25:16] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm also tooling around with this -> http://jsperf.com/append-vs-core-append
[10:25:20] <johnbender> many nights of work
[10:26:08] <johnbender> toddparker: https://github.com/johnbender/applications-cat-theory/tree/master/perf
[10:26:13] <johnbender> _that_ is many nights of work
[11:18:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to basetag: http://git.io/tO7dHg

[13:07:07] <agcolom> Hi, anyone around?
[13:33:16] <toddparker> hi agcolom
[13:33:33] <agcolom> Hi ;-)
[13:34:07] <toddparker> how goes
[13:34:12] <agcolom> nice results on that survey by Mozilla !!!!
[13:34:22] <toddparker> yeah, pretty impressive
[13:34:54] <agcolom> well, we'll have to go to Paris a bit earlier that planned... so making the best of our last few days in the sunshine :-)
[13:35:15] <agcolom> I'll have no internet from thursday eve to the 5th Sept.
[13:35:43] <agcolom> that survey was also featured in the .net magazine!
[13:35:53] <agcolom> let me find the link...
[13:36:27] <agcolom> Chris had told me we were doing really well in his survey, but I was not expecting such amazing results!
[13:36:55] <agcolom> (also I had not seen the survey so I had not entered my views it :)
[13:37:10] <agcolom> my views^ (it should not be there!!!)
[13:37:22] <agcolom> oh no, on is mising!!!
[13:37:44] <agcolom> http://www.netmagazine.com/news/web-ios-and-android-lead-mobile-dev-122157
[13:39:30] <agcolom> there should be a story about why jquery is so popular pretty soon as well... Was supposed to be published last friday, then it was going to be today but a different one came out... I guess sometime this week...
[13:41:36] <agcolom> toddparker: and there's this blog post as well: http://lawrencemandel.com/2012/08/03/mobile-web-compatibility-aug-3-2012-bing-imdb-jquery-mobile-firefox-os/
[13:45:29] <agcolom> and thx for the browser stack account! I'm all setup :-)
[13:50:19] <agcolom> toddparker: in the current docs, text input and textarea are documented together. should it be the same in the api docs?
[13:52:26] <johnbender> toddparker: do you want me to do a deploy today or did you want me to look at something first
[13:52:41] <johnbender> I was working on support for disabling the base tag
[14:31:38] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: gseguin: scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4869
[14:31:48] <johnbender> anyone know of a different example/way to detect ie10?
[14:31:52] <uGoMobi> hi all
[14:32:09] <johnbender> that's based on the MS documentation recommended code snippet
[14:32:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: thanks for browserstack
[14:32:19] <johnbender> just want to make sure I'm not overlooking something
[14:33:10] <scott_gonzalez> Why do you need to detect IE10?
[14:33:29] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/appendto/jquery-mobile/blob/5922506bb3ff01490ff0143b6c55165c976f13bb/js/jquery.mobile.support.js#L111
[14:33:32] <johnbender> we do that
[14:33:34] <johnbender> :/
[14:33:38] <johnbender> not sure it's documented but it would be good to be accurate
[14:33:42] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't answer the question.
[14:33:49] <scott_gonzalez> That just says that you do detect it.
[14:34:01] * johnbender goes to grep for the _exact_ location where we make use of it
[14:35:05] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: grade A browser support detection
[14:35:58] <scott_gonzalez> So you want to detect what exactly?
[14:36:06] <johnbender> the version of IE
[14:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> Grade A = ajax + transitions, right?
[14:36:22] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: Grade A == all the thins
[14:36:23] <johnbender> *things
[14:36:43] <johnbender> transitions support is a gradient within gradeA
[14:37:00] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so this isn't helping me know what you need to actually detect.
[14:37:07] <johnbender> ...
[14:37:09] <johnbender> the version of IE
[14:37:42] <johnbender> if the version of ie >= 7 it's gradeA
[14:37:46] <johnbender> *its
[14:38:16] <johnbender> media queries or IE >= 7 is our gradeA support
[14:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> This is not a real problem.
[14:38:58] <scott_gonzalez> You should remove $.mobile.browser.
[14:39:28] <scott_gonzalez> $.mobile.browser.ie is really "Is this old and busted IE, but good enough to work"
[14:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> The answer is correctly no for IE10.
[14:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> You might as well just rename to that oldIE and only check for versions you care about.
[14:42:15] <scott_gonzalez> But really wherever that is being used should probably just have a different flag signifying the grade.
[14:45:10] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: right now the check returns false in IE10, which isn't necessarily a bad thing given the point you're trying to make
[14:45:21] <johnbender> which seems to be that generally "do we care"
[14:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's a good thing.
[14:47:03] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: so your point is that we should change the semantics of the variable name  to match the existing results rather than change the results to match the semantics of the variable name
[14:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> You actually only use this in one place.
[14:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[14:48:00] <johnbender> we use it in two that matter
[14:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> And in reality you should feature detect on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L225
[14:48:14] <johnbender> the gradeA check and popup
[14:48:24] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah, I missed the gradeA check.
[14:48:54] <scott_gonzalez> Do any versions of IE support media queries?
[14:49:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, 9+10
[14:49:17] <johnbender> 9 and 10
[14:49:32] <johnbender> "support"
[14:49:50] <johnbender> as with all the browsers we'll be watching and waiting for bugs
[14:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> So you should simplify the existing code to only test for 7 and 8.
[14:50:15] <johnbender> only if we remove the .ie
[14:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> No need to loop up from 3, that's just silly.
[14:50:29] <johnbender> and replace it with ie7or8
[14:50:43] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I think we borrowed that test from somewhere
[14:51:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, it's a proper IE version detect for all versions.
[14:51:05] <scott_gonzalez> But you don't care about that.
[14:51:25] <johnbender> I have to check with regards to popup
[14:51:32] <johnbender> if the issue still exists in ie10 then yes we do
[14:51:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you around?
[14:53:16] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there's no comment about what that code is even doing, so it's hard to know what it's for.
[14:53:29] <scott_gonzalez> Is that a memory leak issue?
[14:53:58] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: haven't examined it closely, and I don't have any clue :/
[14:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> Look like this issue: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5185
[14:55:18] <scott_gonzalez> Last comment in the related thread is "I agree, this is still a problem in all IE but IE9."
[14:55:27] <scott_gonzalez> So it sounds like it's just oldIE.
[14:59:17] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: I feel like you could remove all the JS for that and just do it in the stylesheet with some !important rules.
[14:59:35] <scott_gonzalez> This seems like an actual use case for !important :-)
[15:35:32] <toddparker> johnbender: let
[15:35:46] <toddparker> let's talk tomorrow…we need to decide what to do about WP7
[15:35:58] <toddparker> wilt will be back, he's been looking at it
[15:40:21] <johnbender> toddparker: kk
[15:40:28] <johnbender> toddparker: just let me know, I stand ready to deploy
[15:40:31] <johnbender> working on some PRs
[16:57:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to slider-cleanup: http://git.io/BC7Uhw
[16:57:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/slider-cleanup] Single check for slider input type Closes #4458 - Hans-Peter Buniat
