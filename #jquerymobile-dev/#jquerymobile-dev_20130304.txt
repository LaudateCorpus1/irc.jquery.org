[03:33:00] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Old build #192: STILL UNSTABLE in 1 hr 0 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/192/
[06:55:01] <gseguin> Good morning
[06:55:29] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[09:06:08] <gseguin> how come we still have tests for fastClick?
[09:06:17] <gseguin> isn't it long gone?
[09:06:20] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[09:48:19] <maxlynch> toddmparker: did the hangout about themes happen last week?
[09:55:14] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: toddmparker is on vacation this week. we had a hangout last friday about 1.4 planning
[09:55:55] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: also about theming, svg/font icons, SASS/LESS, etc.
[09:55:58] <maxlynch> uGoMobi: oh okay, cool. I wasn't able to make it but I was interested in hearing plans about theming and icons. Anything concrete yet?
[09:56:47] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: we are all giving things some thoughts right now and probably do another hangout next week
[09:57:05] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: so, no concrete plans yet
[09:57:21] <maxlynch> Great, well I hope to make that hopefully.
[09:57:36] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: yeah, would be great if you could join
[09:58:58] <johnbender> gseguin: no idea
[09:59:03] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't even know what that is
[09:59:21] <asheppard> hi, i'm also interested in the css discussion (i was a commenter on #453)
[09:59:51] <johnbender> gseguin: feel free to merge in the new grunt if you want
[10:00:05] <gseguin> johnbender: I have some failing tests left
[10:00:29] <gseguin> it looks like $.testHelper.reloadLib is having trouble
[10:00:49] <uGoMobi> hi asheppard 
[10:01:23] <gseguin> johnbender: I could merge today but I can't deal with test failures
[10:01:34] <gseguin> johnbender: until Wed
[10:01:56] <gseguin> johnbender: so if you're up for fixing tests, I'll do it :P
[10:12:11] <asheppard> uGoMobi: when are topics typically addressed here vs. in a hangout vs. at the weekly #jquery-meeting ?
[10:22:59] <uGoMobi> asheppard: we discuss all kind of things here during the week. at the weekly meeting we all give an update of what we have been working on and discuss bigger issues/changes
[10:23:30] <uGoMobi> asheppard: we do hangouts occasionally
[10:23:48] <uGoMobi> asheppard: just when we want to share thoughts
[10:24:56] <uGoMobi> asheppard: we have some bigger changes in mind for 1.4 so that's why we decided to do a hangout
[10:27:53] <asheppard> uGoMobi: i see, thanks
[10:28:08] <asheppard> uGoMobi: yes some of the 1.4 ideas do seem a bit bigger, i'll be interested in the discussion
[10:28:57] <asheppard> uGoMobi: on a semi-related note, i saw there was a plan to port tabs from UI?
[10:29:21] <uGoMobi> asheppard: yes there is
[10:30:45] <uGoMobi> asheppard: well, maybe not really "porting" but creating our own tab widget based on UI's tabs
[10:34:29] <asheppard> uGoMobi: cool, has that work started yet?
[10:35:21] <uGoMobi> asheppard: no, not really, but arschmitz did a quick test
[10:35:45] <uGoMobi> asheppard: just using UI's tabs and our navbar already worked out pretty well though :)
[10:36:32] <schuranator> I have a question about fixed elements for iOS. I'm noticing when we have a search on a fixed footer the search moves up to allow room for the keyboard. if you scroll the fixed item becomes lost and on some pages it moves up and down but it's not consitent
[10:38:10] <uGoMobi> schuranator: sounds  bit like this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5532
[10:38:57] <schuranator> thank you uGoMobi
[10:39:39] <uGoMobi> you're welcome
[10:41:17] <arschmitz> schuranator: iOS does not respect fixed position while keyboard is open
[10:42:29] <arschmitz> there is no workaround or fix for this its a limitation of fixed position in iOS
[10:42:59] <schuranator> Thank you arschmitz. I was just trying to explain the issue to a boss and he kind of thought I was just being lazy
[10:43:24] <arschmitz> Yeah when the keyboard opens everything becomes fixed where it is on screen
[10:43:38] <schuranator> I was at the jQueryTO conference and mentioned this to a group of people. I still think the use case is why would someone be scrolling if they have the keyboard open like it's not a normal test case
[10:43:47] <arschmitz> and becomes essentially absolute instead of fixed position
[10:44:13] <arschmitz> Yeah i missed jQueryTO just had a baby 
[10:44:22] <schuranator> Oh congratulations on the baby
[10:44:30] <schuranator> It was a really good conference.
[10:44:58] <arschmitz> thanks awesome. But short answer for your boss is there is no position:fixed while keyboard is open in iOS
[10:45:57] <arschmitz> asheppard: as far as Tabs you can pretty much drop ui tabs in right now with out even including ui core 
[10:46:02] <schuranator> yeah I had him here when you replied and I was like thank god for a speedy community
[10:46:15] <arschmitz> you just need a few lines to make it auto enhance i have a jsbin for it maybe i can find it 
[10:46:27] <arschmitz> We do our best :)
[10:49:25] <arschmitz> asheppard: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/686/edit shows how to use ui tabs in mobile without ui core
[11:05:29] <johnbender> gseguin: you around?

[11:20:26] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't know if something changed with the new version of grunt but running and npm install with core's latest doesn't provide a .bin file :(
[11:20:41] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: ^
[11:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: You need to globally install grunt-cli
[11:22:55] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: hmm that sucks
[11:22:59] <johnbender> :(
[11:23:18] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: isn't that going to be an issue on the build server?
[11:23:29] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[11:23:36] <johnbender> leaving my own objections to globally installing something on my dev machine aside 
[11:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> We control what's on our severs.
[11:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> *servers
[11:23:53] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: if we depend on different versions
[11:24:06] <johnbender> UI and Mobile for example might want different version
[11:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> You'll never depend on different versions of grunt-cli
[11:24:08] <johnbender> *versions
[11:24:25] <scott_gonzalez> We might want different versions of grunt, but not grunt-cli
[11:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> grunt-cli does nothing but find the local grunt and run that.
[11:24:48] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: ahh it's just a global binstub
[11:25:20] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: that seems reasonable

[11:25:44] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[11:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> And yes, if grunt itself were installed globally, that'd be bad
[11:26:36] <gseguin> johnbender: on master?
[11:27:20] <johnbender> gseguin: sorry I lost context, what on master?
[11:28:00] <gseguin> that issue with npm install you mentionned
[11:28:28] <johnbender> gseguin: I was unaware that the grunt "binary" was moved out to the grunt-cli package
[11:29:31] <gseguin> johnbender: oh, yeah and it picks up grunt from your workspace's node_modules
[11:29:51] <johnbender> gseguin: you can also just install grunt-cli locally which is what I'm goin on my dev machine :) :)
[11:29:59] <johnbender> s/goin/doing/
[11:30:17] <gseguin> pfff... :)
[11:31:01] <johnbender> gseguin: I've got the list of methods we use so now I need to try and reconcile that with the core source tree and module defs
[11:31:14] <johnbender> gseguin: we may not be able to trim that much other than effects but well see

[11:49:56] <gseguin> `grunt test suites=navigation`
[11:50:01] <gseguin> sorry
[11:50:09] <asheppard> arschmitz: thanks. so it's essentially navbar with tabs handling the content switching?
[11:50:11] <gseguin> `grunt test --suites=navigation`
[11:50:28] <asheppard> arschmitz: sort of like using a persistent navbar but without the duplicate header div

[11:59:20] <gseguin> did you do you npm install ?

[13:14:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Ping!
[13:15:07] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: What do you think about adding if ( this.element.is( "input" ) ) { this.element.prop( "disabled", !!value ); } to the widget factory's _setOption( "disabled", ... ) handler?
[13:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> That should be handled in the widget-specific code.
[13:31:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK, it's just that any widget can be based off of an input, as easily as it can be based off of a span or a div, but in that case, "disabled" carries this additional todo. For example, pretty much all form widgets need to worry about it.
[14:05:07] <johnbender> gseguin: found the issue

[15:42:12] <gseguin> can you take a look?
[15:44:15] <gseguin> johnbender: nevermind, I got it
[15:44:23] <johnbender> gseguin: zomg fuck code like that

[15:44:57] <gseguin> I know right :)
[15:45:11] <johnbender> gseguin: what's wrong with if (foo) { bar } else { baz }
[15:45:17] <johnbender> I'll tell you
[15:45:20] <johnbender> nothing
[15:45:55] <johnbender> note that I said "fuck *CODE*" like that
[15:46:05] <johnbender> and not "fuck developers who write code like that"
[15:46:13] <johnbender> important distinction
[15:46:33] <gseguin> totally
[15:46:45] <gseguin> we all write shitty code at some point in time

[15:53:15] <gseguin> johnbender: looks like something is not going as planned
[15:53:29] <gseguin> johnbender: PhantomJS has crashed.
[15:56:53] <johnbender> gseguin: that happens occasionally on the build server but I have no idea why
[15:57:03] <johnbender> gseguin: also zoom is timing out :(
[15:57:22] <gseguin> johnbender: crashed twice in a row now :(
[15:57:49] <gseguin> let me manually remove the node_modules in the workspace
[16:06:07] <gseguin> johnbender: where is the Jenkins workspace?
[16:07:48] <gseguin> ls
[16:08:03] * gseguin is typing in the wrong window
[16:08:19] <johnbender> gseguin: var lib jenkins?
[16:08:35] <johnbender> gseguin: I feel like that used to be the case now I'm not as sure
[16:08:45] <johnbender> gseguin: looking into the zoom hang
[16:08:55] <gseguin> cool, thanks for that

[16:10:56] <gseguin> johnbender: no luck, removing the node_modules did not help the PhantomJS crash
[16:11:41] * gseguin is dropping F bombs all over
[16:13:02] <johnbender> gseguin: fixed
[16:13:10] <johnbender> gseguin: the zoom hang that is
[16:13:11] <johnbender> :)
[16:13:53] <johnbender> gseguin: oh, did you merge already?
[16:13:59] <gseguin> I did
[16:14:01] <johnbender> suppose I should be making these changes to master :)
[16:14:10] * johnbender checks out master
[16:15:20] <johnbender> gseguin: that's fixed

[16:15:44] <johnbender> gseguin: kitchensink is eating shit too
[16:15:53] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll take a look at that tonight
[16:16:01] <johnbender> I need to clean up my house a bit before my wife gets home :)
[16:16:05] <gseguin> yah saw that earlier
[16:16:16] <gseguin> heh, you too? :)
[16:16:46] <gseguin> johnbender: which version of PhantomJS are we running our tests against at the moment?
[16:16:54] <gseguin> johnbender: before my merge that is
[16:16:56] <johnbender> gseguin: whatever is installed on the server :(
[16:17:05] <johnbender> gseguin: (which has caused issues in the past)
[16:17:15] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm grateful that it's part of the node_modules sandbox
[16:17:29] <johnbender> gseguin: it should be in the path if you want to do a phantom -v
[16:17:40] <johnbender> err phantomjs --version
[16:17:49] <gseguin> johnbender: got it: 1.8.1
[16:17:51] <johnbender> or whatever the hell it is :P
[16:17:57] <johnbender> BAM!
[16:17:59] <johnbender> :P
[16:20:04] <gseguin> johnbender: then I have no clue why PhantomJS is crashing
[16:23:44] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll take a look tomorrow 
[16:23:57] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm going to fix that kitchen sink issue too
[16:24:02] <johnbender> then we should be gtg
[16:24:09] <gseguin> johnbender: thanks man
[16:24:10] <johnbender> gseguin: awesome work btw
[16:24:16] <jlembeck> johnbender: gseguin: if there's anything you guys want me to poke my head in tomorrow, etc. offering my services
[16:24:17] <gseguin> sorry for the mess
[16:24:21] <johnbender> gseguin: gigantic fucking improvement
[16:24:34] <johnbender> jlembeck: ah cool, I'll let you know if I get stuck 
[16:24:44] <johnbender> jlembeck: hopefully it hsouldn't be too bad
[16:24:50] <jlembeck> awesome, me and Phantom have been to battle recently
[16:24:51] <jlembeck> a few times
[16:25:00] <johnbender> jlembeck: ahh! good to know
[16:25:05] <gseguin> jlembeck: have you had phantomjs craash on you when executing qunit tests?
[16:25:31] <jlembeck> all of my crashing with phantom has been unrelated to qunit, but has been related to interacting with node
[16:25:36] <gseguin> jlembeck: it happens only on ci btw not on my local mac
[16:25:43] <jlembeck> ohhh ouch.
[16:26:08] <gseguin> yeah, it sucks
[16:26:28] <gseguin> gnarf: ping
[16:26:29] <jlembeck> My most recent issue, you addressed above in the "Which version of Phantom?" thing
[16:26:52] <jlembeck> it seems like 1.8.1 smoothed some stuff out
[16:26:53] <gseguin> jlembeck: yeah it's the same version we use to run the tests with
[16:27:10] <jlembeck> and node 0.6 was having all sorts of issues
[16:27:17] <jlembeck> because grunt 0.4 requires 0.8
[16:27:48] <gseguin> yup we have 0.8.17 on the Jenkins box
[16:28:04] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: ping
[16:28:22] <jlembeck> huh.
[16:28:38] * gseguin warns everyone, I can go down my roster and ping everyone until someone replies
[16:30:03] <gseguin> jlembeck: thanks for offering your help
[16:30:08] <gseguin> gotta run
[16:30:12] <gseguin> be back online late
[16:30:14] <gseguin> r
[17:41:19] <gseguin> johnbender: it looks like it has nothing to do with the test it's running
[17:41:48] <gseguin> johnbender: but more with the number of tests or assertions we're running
