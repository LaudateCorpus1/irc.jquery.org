[09:32:08] <kinblas> gseguin: 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.037 ms
[09:32:15] <gseguin> heh :)
[09:32:23] <kinblas> :-)
[09:32:35] <gseguin> nerd!
[09:32:38] <gseguin> :P
[09:32:55] <gseguin> question for you
[09:33:16] <kinblas> gseguin: sure
[09:33:40] <gseguin> any reason why the addBackBtn, *Theme are not defined in the option object of "mobile.page"?
[09:33:42] <kinblas> anyone know what "http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js points at?
[09:33:49] <kinblas> is it latest release? Or latest build?
[09:34:15] <gseguin> it should be latest
[09:34:25] <gseguin> s/latest/master/
[09:34:31] * gseguin needs more coffee
[09:34:34] <kinblas> ok so latest dev build
[09:34:55] <kinblas> gseguin: I don't know why they are not listed
[09:35:21] <kinblas> I don't think it hurts to default them
[09:35:40] <gseguin> kinblas: so the consequence is you can't set data-addBackBtn on a page to make an exception
[09:35:57] <gseguin> Am I right?
[09:36:24] * kinblas looks at the code
[09:38:31] <kinblas> gseguin: It's added in jquery.mobile.sections.js
[09:38:48] <kinblas> sorry, I meant page.sections.js
[09:39:11] <gseguin> just realized that
[09:39:11] <kinblas> that's where the header/footer stuff is figured out ... the backbtn being part of the header code
[09:40:15] <kinblas> gseguin: so when you say make an exception, do you mean toggling the default and then using data-addBackBtn="false" on ones you don't want it on?
[09:40:16] <gseguin> so shouldn't I be able to set data-addBackBtn="false" on a page to override the default true for a single page?
[09:40:41] <gseguin> 'xactly
[09:41:51] <kinblas> gseguin: in theory, you should be able to ... the question is how/when are you toggling the default?
[09:42:13] <kinblas> are you toggling before/after the page has been initialized during startup?
[09:42:23] <gseguin> I toggle the default on mobileinit
[09:42:24] <kinblas> folks seem to be having trouble with when/how to initialize stuff
[09:42:38] <kinblas> hmmm that should be good enough
[09:43:06] <gseguin> let me try again
[09:43:30] <gseguin> I'll come up with jsbin to show you
[09:43:39] <kinblas> gseguin: that would be good
[09:43:42] <kinblas> looking at the code:
[09:43:43] <kinblas>                         if ( o.addBackBtn &&
[09:43:43] <kinblas>                                 role === "header" &&
[09:43:43] <kinblas>                                 $( ".ui-page" ).length > 1 &&
[09:43:43] <kinblas>                                 $this.jqmData( "url" ) !== $.mobile.path.stripHash( location.hash ) &&
[09:43:44] <kinblas>                                 !leftbtn ) {
[09:43:55] <kinblas> if false, it should never enter
[09:44:14] <kinblas> gseguin: where o is the options object for the page instance
[09:44:17] <gseguin> yep that's the code I was looking at
[09:44:50] <gseguin> alright so it doesn't look like a user error, let me try that again
[09:50:53] <gseguin> kinblas: total user error
[09:50:57] <gseguin> it's data-add-back-btn="false"
[09:51:06] <gseguin> not data-addBackBtn="false"

[10:28:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] Added info on how to set the fallback transition - toddparker
[10:36:42] <toddmparker_> hey all
[10:37:03] <toddmparker_> gseguin or johnbender - is this a small issue with the AMD/file re-org
[10:37:04] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3394
[10:37:05] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3394 on jquery-mobile, reported by danielcha (1d, 5h ago): Pages no longer working with latest build
[10:37:06] <gseguin> hey toddmparker_, meeting at 11am PST, right?
[10:37:17] * gseguin looks
[10:37:18] <toddmparker_> yep, was just going to remind you all
[10:38:22] <johnbender> gseguin: seems simple, just need to make sure init ends up in the build :D
[10:38:28] <kinblas> johnbender: ping
[10:38:34] <gseguin> woops
[10:38:37] <johnbender> kinblas: pong
[10:38:41] <gseguin> did I forget to check in init ?
[10:39:14] <johnbender> gseguin: don't think so, does that final require include init in the build?
[10:39:17] <kinblas> johnbender: so when you move fixes from HEAD to 1.0-stable ... are you doing some fancy git command to automatically move the patch? Or are you hand editing the branch and then checking in?
[10:40:22] <johnbender> kinblas: git cherry-pick <commit sha hash>
[10:40:40] <kinblas> johnbender: ok
[10:40:46] <johnbender> kinblas: do that from the branch where you want the commit to end up
[10:40:54] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah I think I need to add jquery.mobile.init to the include in the Makefile
[10:40:55] <johnbender> it will creat a new commit with a new hash on that branch
[10:41:03] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[10:41:24] * gseguin tries it out
[10:41:30] <gseguin> :q!
[10:41:39] <gseguin> wrong window :)
[10:42:22] <kinblas> johnbender: gseguin: you guys see this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3394
[10:42:22] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3394 on jquery-mobile, reported by danielcha (1d, 5h ago): Pages no longer working with latest build
[10:42:40] <johnbender> kinblas: todd just linked that
[10:42:46] <johnbender> kinblas: gseguin
[10:42:49] <johnbender> has it
[10:42:52] <kinblas> johnbender: ah ok
[10:43:55] <johnbender> kinblas: it would be nice to set up a build that runs our tests with the built files too
[10:44:02] <johnbender> an actual build process
[10:44:03] <johnbender> :D
[10:44:41] <kinblas> johnbender: right I was just thinking that ... did we move the unit tests over to assuming async?
[10:44:55] <johnbender> kinblas: yah but only to try and sort out dependency issues
[11:00:41] <toddmparker_> ok, dialing in
[11:04:20] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/BUUO0A
[11:04:20] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #3394 - jquery.mobile.init was not being included in the built bundle - Ghislain Seguin
[11:06:45] <toddmparker_> kinblas: you going to hop on the call?
[11:07:16] <toddmparker_> i'm asking about your playbooks
[11:07:19] <kinblas> oops yeah
[11:07:25] <toddmparker_> supposed to have one en route to you and bender
[11:09:23] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm in
[11:24:01] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #378: FAILURE in 11 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/378/
[11:24:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> ghislain: Fixes #3394 - jquery.mobile.init was not being included in the built bundle
[11:24:24] <johnbender> gseguin: nice
[11:24:42] <gseguin> oops - did I break the build?
[11:25:02] <johnbender> gseguin: hah I didn't even see the Failure
[11:25:04] <johnbender> just saw the commit
[11:25:46] <johnbender> gseguin: no that test fails on and off :(
[11:25:57] <gseguin> oh ok
[11:56:33] <johnbender> kinblas: I think I might have spotted an issue with our hashchange setup in FF :(
[11:57:35] <kinblas> oooh
[11:57:48] <kinblas> hashchange? Or the pushstate/replacestate
[11:57:50] <kinblas> ??
[11:58:29] <johnbender> kinblas: I believe pushstate/replacestate
[11:58:48] <johnbender> I'm getting a "spurious" hashchange when going back in a dialog
[11:59:37] <kinblas> johnbender: you get 2? one is expected
[11:59:38] <johnbender> kinblas: I believe its related only in so far as we change the hash twice when theres a dialog state in the hash
[11:59:48] <johnbender> or something like that :/
[12:00:00] <johnbender> I have to look into it more
[12:01:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm worried I gave Jason (?) the impression I was more worried about code quality than about the size of a given pull request
[12:02:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: code quality is less important in this case than RIM's contribution, but the smallness will make everyone's life better
[12:02:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: should I clarify?
[12:03:29] <toddmparker_> no, it was good
[12:03:35] <johnbender> toddmparker_: cool
[12:15:39] <toddmparker_> thanks for hopping on the call guys
[12:36:51] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to fade-out-in-transition: http://git.io/Yrle4A
[12:36:51] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] Added flip page transition. - Mat Marquis
[12:37:36] <Wilto> I have just added my single most hated skeuomorphic interface convention.
[13:11:03] <Wilto> However: it looks and works pretty sweet, here.
[13:19:21] <eddiemonge> how are the branches previews looking?
[13:20:22] <johnbender> eddiemonge: haven't had a chance to take a look at it, it's in the jquerymobile.com repo right?
[13:21:19] <eddiemonge> jquerymobile.com/branches
[13:21:28] <eddiemonge> oh yeah its in that repo
[13:21:32] <johnbender> cool
[13:21:42] <eddiemonge> the live previews should be updating every hour
[13:21:43] <johnbender> yah when I sort out this firefox issue I'll probably dive into that next
[13:22:07] <eddiemonge> firefox issue? absolute positioned elements in a button?
[13:22:33] <johnbender> eddiemonge: hah no, I'm seeing some weirdness with our pushstate implementation that's causing tests to fail in FF
[13:26:26] <Wilto> Woah, long time no see, eddiemonge.
[13:27:29] <eddiemonge> yeah i was on vacation for about two weeks. johnbender went on vacation so i thought i would too
[13:27:50] <johnbender> :D
[13:28:31] <Wilto> johnbender: You heard the man: you’re officially the lynchpin that holds the team together. NO PRESSURE.
[13:29:08] <johnbender> :/
[13:29:15] <johnbender> o.O
[13:30:26] <Wilto> DAMMIT BENDER
[13:30:52] <johnbender> Scott can keep that part
[13:31:12] <Wilto> Fair.
[13:31:27] <Wilto> It is the role of anyone who isn’t around to defend themselves.
[13:53:14] <johnbender> kinblas: remember when we had those timing issues shortly after shipping pushstate?
[13:53:24] <kinblas> ya mon
[13:53:25] <johnbender> where we tossed in a timeout
[13:53:32] <johnbender> yah, that's the problem here
[13:53:47] <kinblas> ew
[13:53:58] <johnbender> the hashchange we want to discard is taking longer than our timeout
[13:54:09] <johnbender> looking back it's sad it took me so long to figure that out
[13:54:37] <kinblas> ah yes ... hashchange triggers browser to see if it can scroll to whatever the hash value is (because it thinks it's an ID)
[13:54:47] <kinblas> is this a big file?
[13:55:00] <johnbender> nope, not sure it has anything to do with scrolling though
[13:55:23] <johnbender> it's just that using replace state where you alter the url and in doing so alter the hash, fires a hashchange :(
[13:55:24] <kinblas> johnbender: Is it some hashchange callback? Or is it the actual setting of the hash?
[13:55:40] <johnbender> s/,//
[13:55:51] <kinblas> so why is it happening now, and not before?
[13:56:01] <johnbender> kinblas: firefox is slow on linux right now :/
[13:56:13] <johnbender> like
[13:56:17] <johnbender> butt-ass slow
[13:56:17] <kinblas> was it faster in 1.0?
[13:56:28] <kinblas> oh you mean the newest version of firefox is slow/
[13:56:29] <kinblas> ?
[13:56:31] <johnbender> yes
[13:56:35] <kinblas> ah
[13:56:58] <johnbender> they might also have increased an internal delay or inadvertantly increased it
[13:57:10] <johnbender> kinblas: note that it's only firefox
[13:57:26] <johnbender> anywway this is something that we've needed to fix
[13:57:33] <johnbender> I'm going to try and hack something together
[13:57:38] * johnbender is scared
[13:57:57] <kinblas> I would strike the word "hack" from your last sentence :-)
[13:58:35] <Wilto> “Hack” can be a positive.
[13:59:02] <kinblas> Wilto: as in "hack me off a piece of that prime rib?"
[13:59:45] <Wilto> Or an MIT “hack.”
[13:59:46] <Wilto> http://hacks.mit.edu/by_year/2006/zelda_triforce/
[14:01:57] <Wilto> Hey, this raise any red flags for anyone, at a glance? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3392
[14:01:58] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by asgeo1 (2d, 20h ago): $.mobile.fixedToolbars.setTouchToggleEnabled() does not work with the "native" toolbars
[14:02:19] <Wilto> Just pulled it and checked it out and it seems okay, but I didn’t have much involvement in the fixed changes apart from testing.
[14:23:48] <toddmparker_> hey guys - are branch previews back up and running? Wilto seems to think so
[14:23:56] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge? ^^
[14:24:32] <toddmparker_> just scrolled up and saw eddiemonge's message
[14:26:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I haven't yet looked into it
[14:28:08] <toddmparker_> looks up to date
[14:28:09] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/fade-out-in-transition/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[14:29:27] * eddiemonge seems to think so
[14:38:39] <johnbender> kinblas: I believe I've resolved this
[14:38:54] <kinblas> solution?
[14:41:35] <johnbender> kinblas: gimme one sec
[14:45:34] <johnbender> kinblas: bind once to the hashchange and also set a timeout
[14:45:41] <johnbender> kinblas: whichever comes first disables the other
[14:45:57] <kinblas> I thought we did something like that before?
[14:46:05] <johnbender> kinblas: might have
[14:46:38] <johnbender> kinblas: you mean, it already exists?
[14:46:58] <johnbender> kinblas: or do you mean we did originally
[14:47:45] <kinblas> I thought I remember Scott/You trying that before
[14:47:48] <johnbender> kinblas: in which case we probably did, I made a bunch of changes to Scott's original code that were not super usefull :(
[14:48:11] <kinblas> johnbender: might want to step backwards through the file change log
[14:48:16] <johnbender> looking now
[14:49:51] <johnbender> kinblas: yah very similar
[14:50:10] <kinblas> was I the one that removed it?
[14:50:12] <johnbender> kinblas: he's even got the namespaced event in there with the unbind
[14:50:18] * kinblas notes he's not looking at the log
[14:50:19] <johnbender> kinblas: no it was me I'm almost positive
[14:50:24] <kinblas> ok whew
[14:50:37] <johnbender> kinblas: and it was super early on
[14:50:43] <johnbender> during the testing
[14:50:49] <johnbender> err
[14:50:51] <johnbender> not testing
[14:50:54] <johnbender> "refactor"
[14:51:38] <johnbender> kinblas: actually I take that back
[14:51:53] <johnbender> Scott had something similar and simplified it to nearly the same thing we have now
[14:53:09] <kinblas> johnbender: ah ok, so he had it working better originally
[14:53:36] <johnbender> kinblas: well, if we assume that strategy, which is very similar to my current strategy, is "better"
[14:53:56] <johnbender> tests are passing, and it fixes the issue I was seeing but it still needs checking
[14:54:15] <johnbender> kinblas: it also makes the pushstate navigation faster
[14:54:37] <johnbender> because we aren't waiting 100ms to run it, just whichever comes first
[14:55:03] <johnbender> hrm
[14:55:05] <johnbender> scratch that
[15:02:26] <toddmparker_> so johnbender - what platforms does this improve?
[15:02:33] <toddmparker_> this the 2.1 issue?
[15:02:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: no, its an issue that's technically existed since we added pushstate
[15:02:58] <toddmparker_> ah
[15:02:59] <johnbender> we just punted on it until it became a problem
[15:03:04] <toddmparker_> right
[15:03:08] <johnbender> because it appeared to work everywhere
[15:03:18] <johnbender> so, it's something of a timebomb
[15:03:19] <toddmparker_> but it didn't...
[15:03:41] <johnbender> well, as long as the hashchange fires before 100ms
[15:06:25] <johnbender> it works fine
[15:16:14] <gseguin> Wilto, can you share the builder page?
[15:17:11] <Wilto> gseguin: Kinda half-baked at the moment, but I’ll check it into the website repo as soon as I can.
[15:17:38] <gseguin> ok, thanks
[15:17:56] <Wilto> Or TR, I guess? Maybe a new repo.
[15:18:02] <Wilto> I should have that presentable by tomorrow, either way.
[15:18:32] <gseguin> cool
[15:20:37] <toddmparker_> any thoughts on where we should put the builder code?
[15:21:12] <gseguin> another repo?
[15:21:19] <toddmparker_> i see jquery core has a download builder repo
[15:21:24] <toddmparker_> see yeah, maybe
[15:21:32] <gseguin> jquery-mobile-web-builder
