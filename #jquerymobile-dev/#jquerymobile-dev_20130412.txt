[02:01:28] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #322: STILL FAILING in 15 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/322/
[04:10:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... I added the following to jqm-demos.js:
[04:10:59] <_|Nix|_> $( window ).on( "load", function() {
[04:10:59] <_|Nix|_> 	setTimeout( function() {
[04:10:59] <_|Nix|_> 		if ( window.performance && window.performance.timing ) {
[04:10:59] <_|Nix|_> 			alert( window.performance.timing.loadEventEnd - window.performance.timing.responseEnd );
[04:11:02] <_|Nix|_> 		}
[04:11:05] <_|Nix|_> 	});
[04:11:07] <_|Nix|_> });
[04:11:40] <_|Nix|_> I loaded form-gallery.php in Chrome 26 and it doesn't seem to be making a big difference.
[04:11:58] <_|Nix|_> So, I guess we have still bigger fish to fry.
[04:12:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Big difference in FF though: 220 ms.
[04:12:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's an average over 11 reloads.
[04:13:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Unfortunately, mobile browsers don't have window.performance :(
[05:17:59] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_ uGoMobi:
[05:18:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:21:18] <arschmitz> saw your perfromance stuff earlier
[05:21:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... nothing Earth-shattering, but decent.
[05:22:04] <arschmitz> i think in general chrome is going to show the least difference so not a huge indicator but hey it was simple change 
[05:22:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For sure.
[05:22:28] <arschmitz> the slower the js engine is the more difference it will make
[05:22:45] <_|Nix|_> ... and FF went from 2602 to 2380 for form-gallery.php
[05:23:04] <arschmitz> thats not bad at all for what amounts to a 1 line change
[05:23:16] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[05:23:34] <_|Nix|_> What do you think about the enhancement-order branch?
[05:23:45] <arschmitz> i bet it would make a big difference on like ie8 or android 2.3
[05:24:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... unfortunately those don't have window.performance, which sucks.
[05:24:11] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:24:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking that, if we go with enhancement-order, we can have a page option to not auto-enhance, since page calls the enhancer instead of the enhancer reacting to pagecreate.
[05:25:23] <arschmitz> there is a feature request for that i think
[05:25:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I'll be darned. That'll be easy to implement.
[05:26:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That should be a default though, not an option, I think, because a page, once created will either be enhanced or not enhanced. If you change the value of such an option during the lifetime of a page it won't make a difference.
[05:26:41] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:28:09] <arschmitz> its in the jquery.mobile.registry.js right?
[05:28:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[05:28:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's organized as an object, like johnbender's nav stuff.
[05:28:42] <arschmitz> yeah i see that it should be that way
[05:29:21] <arschmitz> easy to test and easy to modify externally
[05:29:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The only thing I can think of that I might want to change is to not render the enhancement order to an array of enhancers but instead keep the original dependency information in case new widgets are added at runtime.
[05:29:45] <arschmitz> good idea
[05:30:05] <arschmitz> good for apps where you have a guranteed first page
[05:31:51] <arschmitz> refresh my memory was there a reson your only binding to create and not also page create?
[05:32:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because page calls $.mobile._enhancer.enhance( this.element[ 0 ] );
[05:32:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: During _create()
[05:32:37] <arschmitz> ah ok
[05:32:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, we have this convention that triggering create on an element will cause it to become enhanced.
[05:33:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It and its children.
[05:33:21] <arschmitz> yes which is a good thing its used a lot
[05:33:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but now we have $.mobile._enhancer.enhance()
[05:33:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: /That/ should be called from now on, but whatever.
[05:34:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We don't need to deprecate "create".
[05:34:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's good that pagecreate and create now both call _enhancer.enhance().
[05:35:53] <arschmitz> we can document and depreciate with 1.4 remove in 1.5
[05:36:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I wouldn't mind keeping the event.
[05:36:25] <arschmitz> either way its only a few lines
[05:36:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If we change the implementation later on, the event can stay the same.
[05:36:37] <arschmitz> and does not have any real performance impact
[05:38:55] <arschmitz> so looking at it first pass registry looks good
[05:42:21] <_|Nix|_> COol!
[08:04:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: Enhancer looks great man
[08:04:45] <johnbender> super duper clean
[08:04:49] <johnbender> +1
[08:04:57] <johnbender> yay objects!
[08:04:57] <arschmitz> johnbender: also addresses the initselector issue
[08:05:14] <johnbender> yes I see the ||
[08:05:18] <arschmitz> and as an added bonus abstracts the autoenhance out of the individual widgets
[08:05:47] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah that was one of the advantages that we talked about
[08:05:49] <arschmitz> no more bindings at bottom of each widget which i like a lot
[08:05:53] <johnbender> you only need one create binding
[08:05:59] <arschmitz> yup
[12:18:28] <paul_irish> toddmparker: i forget, did we discuss JQM on the google CDN?
[12:18:39] <paul_irish> are you interested or no?
[12:18:43] <paul_irish> we are.
[13:14:57] <gseguin> paul_irish: yup, how do we make that happen?
[13:15:15] <paul_irish> jQM says yes
[13:15:29] <paul_irish> and gives us a zip of what should go on for the latest rls
[13:16:43] <gseguin> through you or is there a process?
[13:17:12] <gseguin> so zip contains .js, .min.js, .css and .min.css, right?
[13:17:50] <gseguin> paul_irish: ^
[13:18:12] <gseguin> and .map I'm guessing
[13:20:04] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15normanhh3 opened issue #5881: CSS psuedo elements :before and :after not being respected after loading jQueryMobile framework.  02http://git.io/JRioPA
[13:22:37] <paul_irish> gseguin: you have a map now? awesome
[13:22:48] <gseguin> paul_irish: yup!
[13:22:52] <paul_irish> gseguin: it contains whatever the project wants to have on the CDN
[13:23:16] <paul_irish> also jqui helps us out with a MANIFEST file that'd be super useful/
[13:23:48] <gseguin> ok, cool, I'll add a target in our Gruntfile to create that zip
[13:24:29] <paul_irish> that'd be excellent
[13:24:31] <gseguin> what should the MANIFEST contain? 
[13:24:45] <gseguin> file description
[13:24:52] <gseguin> or just the list of files
[13:24:52] <gseguin> ?
[13:25:56] <paul_irish> md5's of all the files
[13:26:01] <paul_irish> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/Gruntfile.js has their technique
[13:26:37] <paul_irish> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.2/MANIFEST
[13:27:53] <gseguin> kewl, thanks for the pointer I'll do some copy/paste
[14:05:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Thanks!
[15:17:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's a problem: initSelector may need to be copied over for the deprecation period.
[15:17:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What if there's code that says $.mobile.popup.prototype.options.initSelector += ", .myPopup";
[15:17:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If we simply remove it, that will end up "undefined, .myPopup";
