[07:22:15] <imjoshdean> mornin' toddmparker_
[07:40:03] <scottjehl> hiya
[07:41:32] <toddmparker_> hi
[08:12:26] <Wilto> Comin’ to you live from a speeding train.
[08:28:24] <toddmparker_> as soon as johnbender is on, he can sort out the fixed branch with scott
[08:54:37] <johnbender> scottjehl:
[08:54:38] <johnbender> yo
[08:54:41] <johnbender> sorry
[08:54:47] <johnbender> I went back to sleep after that email
[08:54:56] <johnbender> I was just up dealin with my daughter :D
[08:55:00] <johnbender> my wife is out on business
[08:55:03] <johnbender> *Away
[08:55:10] <johnbender> scottjehl: what's the word
[09:02:21] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:36:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl created fixedtoolbar-fixed (+7 new commits): http://git.io/_mI9Qg
[09:36:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fixedtoolbar-fixed] removed disable zoom function from init - scottjehl
[09:36:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fixedtoolbar-fixed] removed internal use of the touchOverflowEnabled flag. It'll remain defined until next major release, however. Now in core. - scottjehl
[09:36:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fixedtoolbar-fixed] removed files for previous fixed toolbars implementation - scottjehl
[09:55:31] <toddparker> i'm back
[10:13:47] <toddmparker_>  looks like scott has fixed in a form that can be reviewed by bender
[10:32:24] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm going to do that merge
[10:32:28] <johnbender> sorry I've been spotty this morning
[10:32:33] <johnbender> we ran out of diapers
[10:32:36] * johnbender is a bad parent
[10:54:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to fixedtoolbar-fixed: http://git.io/2nDU6A
[10:54:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fixedtoolbar-fixed] update button markup test to use the fixed toolbar - John Bender
[10:57:20] <johnbender> merged
[10:57:39] <gseguin> yippie!
[11:03:23] <gseguin> johnbender: mind if I re-convert support test into using reloadModule instead of reloadLib ?
[11:03:52] <gseguin> it works fantastically well now
[11:04:13] <johnbender> gseguin: hell yah
[11:04:14] <johnbender> do it
[11:11:17] <toddparker> AWESOME
[11:12:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/O97Bug
[11:12:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Switched to using AMD loader and $.testHelper.reloadModule instead of $.testHelper.reloadLib - Ghislain Seguin
[11:12:36] <gseguin> ?CC
[11:12:36] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[11:12:44] <toddparker> not seeing the updates on /test/
[11:12:51] <toddparker> lemme pull and test locally
[11:13:06] <gseguin> toddparker: the build is so freaking slow
[11:13:33] <toddparker> oh, maybe that's it
[11:13:37] <gseguin> I don't know what we do on post_receive
[11:13:47] <gseguin> if we immediatly trigger a build or not
[11:13:52] <toddparker> does it re-clone the project each time?
[11:14:06] <gseguin> it shouldn't
[11:14:23] * gseguin hopes it's not the case
[11:14:25] <toddparker> hope not :)
[11:14:53] <gseguin> johnbender: do you know what exactly is taking so long on that machine?
[11:15:12] <johnbender> toddparker: is it slow
[11:15:15] <johnbender> or is it now happening
[11:15:19] <johnbender> er not
[11:15:44] <gseguin> also I could set up some logic in the Makefile to use node and fallback to java if node is not present
[11:15:53] <toddparker> well, they work locally
[11:16:00] <gseguin> this way we don't have a hard dep on node
[11:16:00] <toddparker> that;s something
[11:16:12] <gseguin> and our build can be fast
[11:16:14] <toddparker> might be a good idea
[11:16:20] <johnbender> I don't think that the 16 seconds is what todd is talking about though
[11:16:22] <toddparker> is node just that much slower?
[11:16:27] <toddparker> nope
[11:16:36] <toddparker> i mean, it's still outdated on test
[11:16:38] <gseguin> 16s is on my core i7
[11:16:41] <toddparker> and this landed a while ago
[11:17:13] <toddparker> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html
[11:17:13] <gseguin> johnbender: is this a cronjob ?
[11:18:01] <johnbender> gseguin: no it's a post commit hook
[11:18:08] <johnbender> gseguin: I think its blocked up for some reason
[11:18:15] <gseguin> I don't get it then
[11:18:16] <johnbender> i'm pretty sure this has nothing to do with java
[11:18:41] <toddparker> yeah, think it's not updating right now
[11:18:44] <johnbender> the log is showing issues
[11:18:48] <johnbender> I'll take a look
[11:18:49] <toddparker> seems to get jammed up a fair amount
[11:18:52] <toddparker> k
[11:19:11] * johnbender is desirous of a staging server
[11:20:21] <gseguin> johnbender: can you install node on that server ? at least to test if that makes a difference?
[11:20:53] <johnbender> gseguin: let me sort out the issues with the build first
[11:20:58] <gseguin> k
[11:21:27] <johnbender> I don't have a problem generally with what you're talking about but checking for the existence of node doesn't proclude all possible issues with node itself
[11:26:53] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #407: FAILURE in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/407/
[11:26:53] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed disable zoom function from init
[11:26:54] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed internal use of the touchOverflowEnabled flag. It'll remain defined until next major release, however. Now in core.
[11:26:54] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed files for previous fixed toolbars implementation
[11:26:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: defined touchOverflowEnabled in core
[11:26:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added new fixedToolbar plugin (its matching css is already in from the previous messy merge). Docs page is updated to match the new preferred syntax (no changes in API, however)
[11:26:56] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: fixed the slider z index to prevent conflicts with toolbar
[11:26:56] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added unit tests for new fixedtoolbar plugin
[11:26:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: update button markup test to use the fixed toolbar
[11:26:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Switched to using AMD loader and $.testHelper.reloadModule instead of $.testHelper.reloadLib
[11:27:04] <gseguin> nooooooooooo
[11:27:48] <gseguin> ok just one test failing, it's not that bad
[11:28:07] <johnbender> gseguin: well its a couple tests failing
[11:28:20] <johnbender> each failure in the build is one of the suites
[11:28:24] <gseguin> huh?
[11:28:37] <gseguin> oh ok
[11:28:48] <johnbender> gseguin: you can see the list of the failing tests as a list under each failure
[11:29:07] <johnbender> it could contain more information but I haven't taken the time to pull it out of the page and include it in the failure message
[11:29:22] <johnbender> It hasn't been much of an issue
[11:29:32] <gseguin> it's passing locally
[11:29:37] <johnbender> same here
[11:29:39] <johnbender> :(
[11:29:48] <johnbender> I'm guessin it's a timing issue
[11:30:01] <johnbender> going to take a look once I sort out the issues with the build
[11:30:28] <gseguin> I'm looking at that test
[11:30:37] <gseguin> will let you know if I find something
[11:33:31] <gseguin> with phantomjs I get consitently 3 failures on that test
[11:33:56] <johnbender> gseguin: interesting

[11:34:51] <gseguin> T - 30 for JSConf
[11:36:14] <johnbender> gseguin: https://gist.github.com/2e3bba6fe8f45367f819
[11:36:14] <toddparker> gseguin: jsconf?
[11:36:18] <toddparker> tickets?
[11:36:20] <imjoshdean> gseguin: awww yeah.
[11:36:21] <gseguin> yes
[11:36:41] <gseguin> tickets go on sale at 3pm EST
[11:36:43] <toddparker> must be tricky to get tickets
[11:36:59] <gseguin> toddparker: are you speaking?
[11:37:00] <toddparker> with all these geeks writing script to nab tickets? naw.
[11:37:04] <toddparker> nope
[11:37:10] <johnbender> gseguin: that's the build output on the server
[11:37:17] <gseguin> toddparker: are you going?
[11:37:17] <toddparker> they'd find out i'm not a js dev and run me out
[11:37:27] <toddparker> don't think so
[11:37:31] <toddparker> would be fun tho
[11:37:37] <toddparker> when is it this year?
[11:37:58] <gseguin> toddparker: http://jsconfus2012.eventbrite.com/
[11:38:16] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't get the same thing locally though
[11:38:23] <gseguin> johnbender: is that file still referenced in the css @import ?
[11:39:40] <gseguin> check jquery.mobile.css
[11:48:13] <jrburke> gseguin: fyi, merged the r.js 'uselib' branch into master, so the parseDeps thing is now found in master branch, will be in 1.0.5 release: https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/tests/tools/uselib/parseDeps.js
[11:48:50] <gseguin> awesome I'll update my node service accordingly once 1.0.5 is out
[11:48:57] <gseguin> thanks for the heads up
[11:54:54] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I'm running the build manually and it's basically just stopped at the css target
[11:55:10] <gseguin> what's in that css ?
[11:55:26] <gseguin> can you cat the context into a gist?
[11:55:46] <johnbender> gseguin: what do you mean the "context"
[11:56:03] <gseguin> I meant css
[11:56:24] <gseguin> how did that ever come out as context ?
[11:56:25] <johnbender> gseguin: you want me to cat the project css into a gist or the compiled css
[11:56:33] * gseguin looks at his fingers
[11:56:54] <gseguin> the source default/jquery.mobile.css
[12:00:18] <johnbender> kk
[12:00:31] <johnbender> gseguin: do you not have it locally lol
[12:00:33] <johnbender> just asking :D
[12:00:47] <johnbender> you're wondering if it's different on the server?
[12:01:38] <johnbender> yah the build is taking ∞
[12:02:02] <johnbender> but at this point even if node is an order of magnitude faster, this won't work
[12:02:18] <johnbender> I think it's on to the js now
[12:02:36] <johnbender> also, I can't tell if it's the connection but it appears that the disk is running pretty slow on the machine
[12:03:05] <johnbender> yah
[12:03:10] <johnbender> prepending is taking forever lol
[12:03:12] <johnbender> wtf
[12:05:23] <johnbender> wow
[12:05:25] <johnbender> this is just brutal
[12:07:23] <johnbender> gseguin: there is no default folder on the server for some reason
[12:07:44] <johnbender> there is also no default in my source tree
[12:14:45] <toddparker> fun
[12:15:02] <toddparker> gseguin: did you score a ticket? sold old already for the cheap seats
[12:15:10] <toddparker> johnbender: you going to jsconf
[12:16:38] <johnbender> toddparker: no plans
[12:16:44] <johnbender> I'd have to come up with a reason
[12:17:26] <johnbender> toddparker: are we making a jqm showing?
[12:30:01] <johnbender> brb
[12:39:32] <toddparker> don't think so no
[12:39:50] <toddparker> for that crowd, not sure how much interest. could be wrong tho
[12:56:10] <toddparker> so are you guys still tinkering with the test update?
[12:59:42] <gseguin> sorry johnbender I was grabbing a ticket for JSConf and then lunch
[12:59:45] <gseguin> back now
[13:00:12] <gseguin> toddparker: I did get one
[13:00:28] <gseguin> it sold out of early bird tickets within seconds
[13:24:53] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker: so my findings on the server were unfortunate
[13:25:02] <johnbender> it took like 10 minutes for the build to not even c omplete
[13:25:09] <johnbender> I'm concerned there's a disk issue there
[13:38:49] <toddparker> johnbender: which server is this? does danheberden need to help us clean up space?
[13:39:31] <danheberden> toddparker i don't know much about it
[13:39:34] <danheberden> i wasn't the one to set it up
[13:39:46] <toddparker> hm
[13:39:47] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm going out on a limb there though
[13:40:01] <toddparker> so who set this up originally?
[13:40:03] <johnbender> I don't want to bother anyone unless I have a useful metric as evidence
[13:40:16] <johnbender> as with anything it's more likely an issue with what we're doing
[13:40:39] <toddparker> johnbender: is this a jQ server?
[13:42:11] <johnbender> toddparker: yah it's the one that hosts everything
[13:42:32] <danheberden> i thought jörn set up jenkins
[13:42:35] <toddparker> ah, ok
[13:42:35] <danheberden> but that was for ui
[13:42:39] <danheberden> not sure if it's the same?
[13:43:10] <toddparker> johnbender: is this for testing or the branch previews? Or both
[13:49:03] <johnbender> toddparker: it's our build for creating latest
[13:49:05] <johnbender> well
[13:49:10] <johnbender> it's the build in general
[13:49:23] <johnbender> it's just butt ass slow right now on the server
[13:53:33] <danheberden> johnbender on jquerymobile.com?
[13:53:58] <johnbender> danheberden: yah
[13:55:17] <johnbender> danheberden: I don't want to waste anyone elses time though until I know it's _not_ the build itself
[13:56:53] <gseguin> johnbender: so the merge is done, we can land things right?
[13:57:00] <johnbender> gseguin: ah thats right
[13:57:07] <gseguin> ok
[13:57:08] <johnbender> I suppose I should have been explicit about the "unfreeze"
[14:00:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Wrp07A
[14:00:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3451 from eddiemonge/caching - Ghislain Seguin
[14:00:50] <toddparker> unfrozen
[14:01:13] <toddparker> sorry if i dropped out for a bit..what can i do to help out on the server stuff
[14:01:58] <gseguin> so I'll create a branch for _|Nix|_
[14:02:03] <gseguin> pr
[14:02:08] <johnbender> toddparker: not much
[14:02:10] <toddparker> cool
[14:02:22] <toddparker> but we're still having crazy slowness
[14:02:23] <johnbender> I'm going to try taking out the css stuff since that seems to be taking forever and see what I get
[14:02:33] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm getting like 2 mins+ on my machine with make latest
[14:02:45] <toddparker> scott_gonzalez mentioned on Skype that "Jenkins is apparently killing our test server right now. Is anyone able to look into it?"
[14:02:52] <toddparker> is that on the same server?
[14:02:57] <johnbender> toddparker: yah I think it is
[14:03:00] <johnbender> that would explain it
[14:03:04] <johnbender> but it's slow on my machine as well
[14:03:14] <scott_gonzalez> That server should be fixed now.
[14:03:15] <toddparker> but you're having a 2 minute build on local?
[14:03:21] <toddparker> ah, thanks scott_gonzalez
[14:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> Jenkins was restarted
[14:03:56] <toddparker> cool
[14:04:07] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: yah I was going to say top shows it's pretty low resources right now
[14:04:27] <johnbender> toddparker: yah
[14:04:32] <gseguin> johnbender: what's your local machine? a 486 DX2 66 ?
[14:04:39] <johnbender> gseguin: something like that
[14:04:47] <johnbender> core i5
[14:04:57] <johnbender> sdd, 8gb ram bla bla
[14:05:21] <gseguin> try with node then, just replace the java call by node
[14:05:21] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: thanks for the update
[14:05:30] * johnbender doesn't have node installed
[14:05:36] * johnbender goes to do a dirty thing to his machine
[14:05:39] <gseguin> shame on you!
[14:05:41] <gseguin> :)
[14:05:49] <johnbender> gseguin: is there a version requirement
[14:05:58] <gseguin> do you have homebrew?
[14:06:08] <johnbender> or can I use the version that's most likely in package management that's like a month old but is probably five minor versions out of date?
[14:06:11] <johnbender> gseguin: I run linux ...
[14:06:34] <johnbender> yay netsplit!
[14:07:00] <johnbender> gseguin: where did I loose you
[14:07:11] <gseguin> is it osx ?
[14:07:18] <johnbender> I run linux
[14:07:22] <gseguin> oh ok
[14:07:24] <johnbender> so the answer there would be no
[14:07:27] <johnbender> I'm looking for a ppa
[14:07:29] <johnbender> hold on
[14:07:34] <gseguin> yeah you can use 0.4+
[14:07:35] <johnbender> what's the latest version of node?
[14:07:37] <johnbender> kk
[14:07:39] <johnbender> there's a ppa
[14:07:42] <johnbender> whew
[14:07:49] * johnbender praises the package management gods
[14:08:01] <gseguin> latest is 0.7 I think, isn't it?
[14:08:13] <johnbender> hahah
[14:08:14] <johnbender> wtf
[14:08:34] <johnbender> the builds in this ppa are like 4.12
[14:09:55] <gseguin> johnbender: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager
[14:10:10] <johnbender> gseguin: yep I'm looking at that right now
[14:10:15] <johnbender> zomg
[14:10:18] <johnbender> version 6!
[14:10:20] <johnbender> so close!
[14:10:27] <johnbender> installing anyway
[14:10:46] <gseguin> .7 is not out
[14:11:51] <johnbender> gseguin: do you have a branch I can pull with the changes to the makefile to use node?
[14:11:56] <johnbender> or is it a trivial change?
[14:12:03] <gseguin> very trivial
[14:12:09] <johnbender> gist me brotha
[14:12:19] <gseguin> 'k
[14:13:29] <johnbender> gseguin: or patch me
[14:13:33] <johnbender> that would be better :D

[14:27:47] <toddparker> perfect
[14:28:03] <toddparker> there was a popup branch
[14:28:11] <toddparker> but it was pretty old
[14:28:22] <gseguin> should I delete it?
[14:28:26] <toddparker> so i asked _|Nix|_ to just start a fresh one

[14:28:39] <toddparker> lemme check one thing
[14:28:43] <gseguin> sure
[14:30:51] <toddparker> yep, delete "popup"
[14:31:02] <toddparker> he rolled my changes into that new branch
[14:31:03] <gseguin> 'k
[14:31:38] <gseguin> done
[14:39:20] <gseguin> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3141 is marked for 1.0.1 but the fix is only in master
[14:39:20] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3141 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1m, 3w ago): Prevent data-role="button" from double enhancing buttons or inputs
[14:39:45] <johnbender> gseguin: that got merged but not cherry picked
[14:39:48] <gseguin> that's a miss, right?
[14:39:53] <gseguin> ok
[14:40:02] <johnbender> we need to make sure people are doing that
[14:40:09] <johnbender> though toddmparker_ has asked me to go back through and double check
[14:40:45] <gseguin> wouldn't it make more sense to have these commited to 1.0-stable
[14:40:46] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ok the build is moving at a normal pace now
[14:40:53] <johnbender> gseguin: should be in both
[14:40:55] <gseguin> and then merge 1.0-stable onto master ?
[14:41:06] <johnbender> gseguin: either way
[14:41:19] <gseguin> it's less error prone this way
[14:41:22] <johnbender> gseguin: cherry picking creates a nice clean history in both cases
[14:41:32] <johnbender> gseguin: error prone meaning lost commits?
[14:41:51] <gseguin> missed ones yeah
[14:42:04] <johnbender> toddmparker_: build takes 55 seconds on the server when things aren't totally haywire
[14:42:59] <gseguin> if we commit the 1.0.1 issues exclusively to 1.0-stable then we're sure that 1.0.1 won't miss any fix
[14:43:24] <gseguin> and then we merge 1.0-stable every once in a while onto master
[14:44:07] <johnbender> gseguin: I think that was the original plan
[14:44:33] <johnbender> but with PRs most people will end up just merging into master
[14:44:41] <johnbender> since the pr is against master
[14:44:45] <johnbender> generally
[14:44:49] <gseguin> true
[14:44:59] <johnbender> which sucks if it's built on top of a feature
[14:45:04] <johnbender> or rather assumes a feature change
[14:45:14] <johnbender> in which case it can't really go into stable in that form anyhow
[14:45:29] <johnbender> that's when you get into "porting" bug fixes
[14:45:41] <johnbender> the tests should move across just find though
[14:45:58] <johnbender> gseguin: which reminds me, were you still looking at those failures on page-sections?
[14:46:07] <gseguin> nope
[14:46:11] <gseguin> but I can
[14:46:23] <johnbender> since you can repro with phantom that would be nice
[14:46:27] <johnbender> don't have to though
[14:46:29] <johnbender> I can look into it
[14:46:33] * johnbender grows tired of fixing tests
[14:47:10] <gseguin> ok
[14:47:22] <gseguin> pushing that fix to 1.0-stable and switching to that
[14:47:54] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: is the jenkins process on the prod server just the slave that testswarm uses to communicate results?
[14:48:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/8NQ2qw
[14:48:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] fixes #3141 - redirect from button() and buttonMarkup() to correct function for element - Garann Means
[14:48:56] <johnbender> jzaefferer: is the jenkins process on the prod server just the slave that testswarm uses to communicate results?
[14:49:17] <johnbender> or is that the main jenkins instance?
[14:49:33] <johnbender> or is it some cool third option that I don't know about?
[14:53:08] <imjoshdean> gseguin: I thought we decided we needed  both?
[14:53:13] <garann> hey, speaking of that pull request.. am i correct in thinking that imjoshdean is working on both the issues i'm tagged on now?
[14:53:30] <gseguin> imjoshdean: oops
[14:53:53] <gseguin> garann: I don't know
[14:54:21] <gseguin> imjoshdean: do we? I just realized too that the $button var is not needed in 1.0-stable
[14:54:21] <garann> imjoshdean?
[14:54:37] <imjoshdean> garann: which issues were you tagged on?
[14:54:52] <imjoshdean> gseguin: I would talk with johnbender, we had that whole chat two nights ago about it
[14:55:03] <garann> just the button one and this slider issue, which it appears you looked at already and couldn't repro
[14:55:16] <gseguin> sorry for missing that, I'll reopen the PR then
[14:55:34] <toddparker> wow, we have a problem of *too much* help?
[14:55:51] <imjoshdean> garann: Yeah, a mixture between what gseguin and I did seemed to fix the button issue
[14:55:58] <toddparker> no need to fight over issues, we've got plenty to go around :)
[14:56:00] <imjoshdean> and the slider I couldn't repo with master
[14:56:04] <imjoshdean> NO IT'S MY ISSUE
[14:56:10] <imjoshdean> THERE ARE MANY LIKE IT BUT THIS ONE IS MINE
[14:56:20] <garann> i was going to say, it looks like imjoshdean has those two, so i was going to take this opportunity to bow out of working on jqm
[14:56:28] <garann> i don't feel like i'm able to help a lot :/
[14:56:34] <garann> since i'm not doing mobile dev now
[14:58:10] <toddparker> yeah garann?
[14:58:27] <toddparker> that's too bad, we like having you around
[14:58:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: what issue were you seeing with the build, is it just out of date?
[14:58:32] <toddparker> but i understand
[14:58:49] <garann> toddparker: yeah, i like the idea of helping, but i lack the context to be very efficient
[14:58:57] <garann> and the testing devices, but we knew that..
[14:59:22] <toddparker> yeah, well if you do want to get sucked back in sometime later, we'l love to have you
[14:59:27] <toddparker> life is long
[14:59:49] <garann> yeah, totally - i figure i will doing mobile dev at some point not far in the future :)
[15:00:04] <gseguin> johnbender: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/js/jquery.mobile.docs.js
[15:00:13] <gseguin> it should have the sha at the top
[15:00:21] <toddparker> woah
[15:00:27] <toddparker> this was stale earlier today
[15:00:36] <toddparker> but now the fixed pages are really busted
[15:00:37] <toddparker> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/docs/toolbars/bars-fullscreen.html
[15:00:44] <toddparker> they half fade in
[15:00:50] <toddparker> guessing a script error
[15:01:24] <toddparker> in chrome/mac
[15:01:29] <gseguin> johnbender: can you land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3442 since it seems you discussed it with imjoshdean
[15:01:30] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by imjoshdean (1d, 22h ago): Bug fix for #3141: Prevent inputs with unnecessary data-role button from being double enhanced
[15:01:33] <toddparker> loads on Safari tho
[15:01:43] <toddparker> but it look alike the old toolbars still
[15:01:52] <toddparker> something isn't right up there still
[15:02:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/OVZWjQ
[15:02:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Removed unused var - Ghislain Seguin
[15:02:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: works locally?
[15:04:06] <gseguin> johnbender: is jquery.mobile.headerfooter.css gone?
[15:04:15] <gseguin> on purpose?
[15:05:32] <johnbender> gseguin: I believe that was removed by scott's branch
[15:05:39] <gseguin> ok
[15:05:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the opacity is .9 in the css
[15:05:54] <gseguin> it needs to be removed from **/jquery.mobile.css
[15:06:08] * gseguin is taking care of it
[15:06:13] <imjoshdean> johnbender, gseguin: I'm going to drive home, but I'll take my laptop with me and be back on after cooking dinner
[15:06:24] <imjoshdean> PM me if you need anything
[15:06:32] <johnbender> imjoshdean: will do
[15:06:47] <johnbender> gseguin: yah that's what I figured
[15:09:54] <gseguin> here it goes
[15:10:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/xuwtnw
[15:10:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed @import for jquery.mobile.headerfooter.css - Ghislain Seguin
[15:10:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed @import statement, they belong in jquery.mobile.css - Ghislain Seguin
[15:10:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added fixed toolbar stylesheet - Ghislain Seguin
[15:10:53] <gseguin> johnbender: is the build stuck again?
[15:13:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't *think* so
[15:13:29] <johnbender> checking
[15:14:13] <johnbender> gseguin: it looks like it's dying part way through
[15:14:24] <johnbender> I'm guessin there's a timeout in the post commit hook or some such
[15:14:39] <gseguin> can you trigger one manually?
[15:14:46] <gseguin> it should go through now
[15:14:47] <johnbender> I think so
[15:14:50] <gseguin> after an update
[15:15:08] <johnbender> gseguin: the css issue is gone
[15:15:10] <johnbender> at least
[15:15:25] <gseguin> I was having it locally
[15:21:16] * gseguin is back to figuring out these tests
[15:25:53] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-1.0-stable build #14: FAILURE in 12 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-1.0-stable/14/

[15:29:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #409: FIXED in 16 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/409/
[15:29:58] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Removed @import for jquery.mobile.headerfooter.css
[15:29:58] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Removed @import statement, they belong in jquery.mobile.css
[15:29:59] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Added fixed toolbar stylesheet
[15:34:49] <johnbender> interesting
[15:36:25] <johnbender> gseguin: did you get my reply to the meeting on friday
[15:36:31] <johnbender> I'm not sure if it sent or not
[15:36:37] * johnbender grumbles about Mail.app
[15:42:53] <gseguin> yes johnbender, got it
[15:42:59] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[15:45:56] <gseguin> johnbender: that build is still not working
[15:46:06] <gseguin> it seems
[15:46:29] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm pretty sure it's getting cut off mid run because of the request
[15:46:37] <johnbender> before the build was like 10 secs
[15:46:48] <johnbender> now we've extended it well past the likely process timeout
[15:46:50] <johnbender> one sec
[15:46:54] <gseguin> hey the tests pass!
[15:46:59] <gseguin> YEEEEHHHHAAAA
[15:47:00] <johnbender> gseguin: :D
[15:47:10] <johnbender> let me check if php's ssh_exec is a cast or a call
[15:47:31] <johnbender> pretty sure its a call since it waits on the response
[15:52:08] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[15:52:12] <johnbender> wondering how to deal with this
[15:52:23] <gseguin> node
[15:52:32] * gseguin sounds like a broken record
[15:52:39] <gseguin> :)
[15:52:46] <johnbender> I don't think that matters
[15:52:53] <johnbender> it's like 20 seconds on my machine with node
[15:52:55] <gseguin> I was just trying
[15:53:20] <gseguin> I'll make that a default answer, sometimes it's going to work, I'm sure of it
[15:53:23] <johnbender> gseguin: we probably need to solve the "makes syscalls from a php script" problem
[15:53:27] <johnbender> gseguin: haha
[15:53:33] <johnbender> going to catch me off guard eh?
[15:54:00] <gseguin> so wait, where is that thing>
[15:54:02] <gseguin> ?
[15:54:20] <johnbender> gseguin: the gitpostcommit.php is in jquery/jquerymoble.com
[15:54:24] <johnbender> github
[15:54:30] <johnbender> I *think
[15:54:33] <johnbender> its public
[15:54:35] * gseguin looks
[15:54:35] <johnbender> let me go look
[15:54:59] <johnbender> its locked
[15:55:17] <johnbender> gseguin: it just shells out to run the build
[15:55:30] <johnbender> I think we need to just cast that off and let the request finish
[15:56:22] <johnbender> move the logging into the call
[15:56:34] <johnbender> which will be nice since it won't have all the php array bullshit wrapped around it
[15:56:58] <gseguin> I don't have access to that project
[15:57:04] <gseguin> that stinks
[15:57:20] <johnbender> gseguin: yah don't worry about it I'm looking into it
[15:57:22] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[15:57:37] <johnbender> gseguin: both those prs from imjoshdean can be merged in
[15:57:39] <johnbender> I looked over them
[15:57:46] <gseguin> k
[15:57:50] <gseguin> I'll do that
[15:57:50] <johnbender> the only thing I was waiting on was for kin to reply about the click
[15:58:04] <johnbender> gseguin: they do need tests though, so feel free to pester imjoshdean about that :D
[15:58:07] * johnbender ducks out
[15:58:59] * gseguin points his finger at johnbender
[16:00:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/xmdd3A
[16:00:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3442 from imjoshdean/master - Ghislain Seguin
[16:03:17] <gseguin> johnbender: git question for you
[16:03:27] <gseguin> when I cherry-pick
[16:03:47] <gseguin> $ git cherry-pick ed124bf2378f244b745c7872f0ee573ab4555924
[16:03:47] <gseguin> fatal: Commit ed124bf2378f244b745c7872f0ee573ab4555924 is a merge but no -m option was given.
[16:04:09] <gseguin> that's because the commit I'm pointing to is the pr merge commit
[16:04:41] <gseguin> have you tried -m before?
[16:06:21] <johnbender> gseguin: yes
[16:06:29] <johnbender> I wouldn't do that for a cherry pick
[16:06:34] <gseguin> k
[16:06:41] <johnbender> just reference the commit sha's from the branch
[16:06:49] <johnbender> I assume you're merging imjoshdean's branch
[16:06:50] <gseguin> so that works here
[16:07:01] <gseguin> but say there are plenty of commits in the PR ?
[16:07:01] <johnbender> gseguin: yes it does
[16:07:09] <johnbender> I would merge directly into stable then
[16:07:14] <johnbender> which you can also do here
[16:09:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/R7A9dw
[16:09:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Prevent inputs with unnecessary data-role button from being double enhanced - Josh Dean
[16:09:32] <johnbender> gseguin: does that answer your question, you might have a better idea
[16:09:48] <johnbender> it speaks a bit to your earlier question about mergeing back and forth
[16:09:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/WEnpUw
[16:09:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3441 from imjoshdean/fix-3351 - Ghislain Seguin
[16:10:07] <gseguin> I cherry  picked the specific commit
[16:10:18] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[16:10:23] <johnbender> thanks for doing that
[16:10:36] <gseguin> no problem
[16:11:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/WV2WOg
[16:11:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Fix to #3351, dialogs reopening when attempting to close them - Josh Dean
[16:12:55] <gseguin> do we have CI running on 1.0-stable?
[16:13:49] <johnbender> gseguin: yes
[16:14:01] <gseguin> awesome
[16:16:48] <gseguin> hey I have an idea,
[16:17:26] <gseguin> how about using my amd-builder service for the build thing?
[16:17:49] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[16:17:53] <gseguin> yeah no, forget about it
[16:17:56] <gseguin> bad idea
[16:18:21] <johnbender> gseguin: I forked the jquerymobile.com site and I'm going to convert this stuff into shell script
[16:18:35] <johnbender> so it can just get shelled out by the php script move on
[16:18:43] <johnbender> that way it will have time to finish
[16:18:49] <johnbender> then we can discuss node
[16:18:55] <gseguin> sounds like a plan
[16:18:59] <rwaldron> hey dudes
[16:19:04] <johnbender> gseguin: and, just as a side note it's already instaleld
[16:19:08] <johnbender> rwaldron: heyo!
[16:19:30] <gseguin> johnbender: great
[16:19:33] <johnbender> our big brother who will beat you up :D
[16:19:35] <rwaldron> so, i derived this from the client project I've been doing for the last many months...
[16:19:36] <rwaldron> https://github.com/rwldrn/jquery-mobile-badge
[16:19:37] <gseguin> hey rwaldron
[16:19:51] <rwaldron> it's um... "rough"
[16:19:57] <rwaldron> read: barely works
[16:20:11] <rwaldron> but, not bad for one days effort
[16:22:20] * gseguin looks through the code
[16:22:24] <johnbender> rwaldron: cool man, are you having issues that we can help with?
[16:22:45] <rwaldron> naw, was looking for feedback, no rush
[16:22:56] <rwaldron> constructive crit welcome
[16:23:17] <rwaldron> i figured the best guys to look at a jquery mobile plugin are the jquery mobile devs
[16:24:23] <gseguin> rwaldron: why didn't you use data-role ?
[16:24:44] <johnbender> was just going to ask that
[16:25:25] <johnbender> hmm
[16:25:32] <johnbender> I guess with namespacing it actually doesn't matter too much
[16:25:55] <johnbender> althought that's the project convention (established before namespacing)
[16:27:00] <rwaldron> dunno
[16:27:11] <rwaldron> i started with "fetch"
[16:27:20] <rwaldron> Wilto pointed me to that file
[16:27:30] <rwaldron> and used that as the base
[16:27:39] <rwaldron> i'm not married to anything here

[16:28:11] <johnbender> gseguin: ^ lol
[16:28:12] <rwaldron> I'll file myself an issue
[16:28:16] <johnbender> well we know it's working :D
[16:28:29] <gseguin> What the.. ?
[16:28:31] <johnbender> rwaldron: are you relying on a third party to update the value?
[16:28:42] <johnbender> gseguin: let me check the email
[16:28:47] <johnbender> it might be something
[16:28:52] <johnbender> else
[16:29:03] <johnbender> gseguin: yep
[16:29:09] <johnbender> it's that damn nav test
[16:29:11] <gseguin> oh it's the navigation thing
[16:29:29] <gseguin> yeah that's awright then
[16:29:32] <johnbender> gseguin: I think we might have sorted that out in master
[16:29:36] <johnbender> let me check
[16:29:42] <johnbender> then I can cherry pick that change over
[16:29:52] <gseguin> great

[16:30:16] <rwaldron> johnbender I'm not quite sure I follow
[16:30:17] <gseguin> aww ffuuuuuuuu
[16:30:28] <rwaldron> but let's say i need to update the badge...
[16:30:34] <rwaldron> if it has an id
[16:30:42] <rwaldron> $("#foo").html(val)
[16:31:04] <johnbender> rwaldron: yah that's what I meant
[16:31:23] <rwaldron> anything you put on the placeholder is retained
[16:31:57] <johnbender> rwaldron: what about updating the value?
[16:32:19] <rwaldron> like a relative update?
[16:32:22] <johnbender> since it's new markup
[16:32:36] <johnbender> hold on maybe I need to read more thoroughly
[16:32:46] <johnbender> ah
[16:32:53] <johnbender> you just nest it in the new markup
[16:33:00] <rwaldron> yes
[16:33:03] <johnbender> cool
[16:33:13] <johnbender> well I certainly can't think of anything obvious
[16:33:17] <rwaldron> well, i nest a clone
[16:33:22] <johnbender> you've used the create convention for "plugins"
[16:33:33] <gseguin> oh man! that page sections failure is back
[16:33:34] <johnbender> rwaldron: but you can still reference it with a selector
[16:33:41] <rwaldron> yessit
[16:33:45] <rwaldron> sir*
[16:34:09] <rwaldron> have tests for it
[16:34:17] <johnbender> rwaldron: if you have a js object reference to that before and then you run the .fn method defined by the widget won't the js object be invalid
[16:34:23] * johnbender is grasping at straws
[16:34:40] <rwaldron> i set a bunch of classes and an id and then try to reselect
[16:35:02] <rwaldron> johnbender TBH, not sure
[16:35:19] <johnbender> rwaldron: massive corner case
[16:35:22] <rwaldron> if you can write a test that fails for it?
[16:35:50] <johnbender> rwaldron: lemme try real fast
[16:36:03] <rwaldron> Cool
[16:38:09] <rwaldron> ok, so this is the "plugin" that Wilto had me start from
[16:38:10] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/fetchlink/js/jquery.mobile.fetchlinks.js
[16:38:39] <rwaldron> see that it uses "target", so that maps to "data-target"... which is why i ended up with "data-badge"
[16:38:59] <gseguin> DAMMIT WILTO
[16:39:01] <rwaldron> but if data-role="badge" is the way to go, to stay idiomatic, then I'll change
[16:39:10] <rwaldron> naw, not his fault
[16:39:17] <rwaldron> I probably misunderstood
[16:40:31] <gseguin> I think it's a cool plugin
[16:41:16] <rwaldron> word
[16:41:23] <rwaldron> next up is themes
[16:41:30] <rwaldron> so its not like "iOS ONLY"
[16:41:35] <rwaldron> all else must perish!
[16:41:49] <rwaldron> bbbuuuuttt i stink at css
[16:41:56] <rwaldron> so feel free to take a crack at it
[16:42:24] <rwaldron> gseguin i just pushed an update to use data-role="badge"
[16:42:45] <rwaldron> thanks for pointing that out
[16:42:46] <gseguin> that would be a job for Wilto or toddparker
[16:43:00] <rwaldron> the css?
[16:43:02] <rwaldron> word
[16:43:04] <gseguin> yeah
[16:43:16] <rwaldron> Wilto mentioned he wanted to play with it
[16:43:24] <rwaldron> i'll ping toddparker and see if he's interested
[16:43:33] <rwaldron> johnbender hey dude, no rush on that test stuff
[16:43:39] <rwaldron> i'm going to pack up and head home
[16:43:57] <gseguin> rwaldron: did you snag a ticket for JSConf?
[16:44:02] <rwaldron> haha
[16:44:03] <rwaldron> no
[16:44:14] <gseguin> missed it or not going?
[16:44:16] <rwaldron> i saw the quanitity box twice
[16:44:24] <rwaldron> there are more tickets next week
[16:44:41] <johnbender> rwaldron: qq, whats with the iframe in the tests
[16:44:50] <johnbender> I only ask because it's an idea I've had for a while to manage state
[16:44:54] <rwaldron> I'm the man, thats what
[16:45:00] * rwaldron dancin
[16:45:19] <rwaldron> i sandboxed the jquery-mobile stuff into an iframe and run that as the fixture
[16:45:30] <rwaldron> since all the tests so far are DOM manipulation
[16:45:42] <rwaldron> I'm really just looking for "did stuff get made"
[16:45:50] <rwaldron> "does it have the right stuff in it"
[16:45:56] <johnbender> rwaldron: it is, in general, a good idea because of all the crazy ass state
[16:46:02] <rwaldron> and jquery mobile was doing a number on qunit
[16:46:05] <johnbender> for single page apps
[16:46:25] <johnbender> smart man
[16:46:31] <johnbender> that rwaldron
[16:46:34] <rwaldron> so sandboxing fixed those issues
[16:46:42] <rwaldron> and still allows me to test thing things i want
[16:46:49] <rwaldron> and i can visually confirm
[16:47:00] <rwaldron> i was running that in iOS and the browser today
[16:47:24] <rwaldron> actually, see the screenshot in the repo's readme?
[16:47:42] <rwaldron> if you look at the top, just above the black header bar
[16:47:49] <rwaldron> you'll notice thats actually the test suite
[16:48:07] <rwaldron> ok fellas, thanks again for everything
[16:48:14] <rwaldron> always a pleasure
[16:48:20] <rwaldron> i really appreciate your feedback
[16:48:24] <rwaldron> i'm headin' out
[16:50:36] <gseguin> later
[16:51:23] <jzaefferer> hey johnbender, whatever highlight you had on me here, it got lost in a few hundred messages; please PM me with it, thx gn8
[16:52:56] <imjoshdean> what'd I miss?
[16:52:59] <mrmax> Hey guys, how interested are you in bugs and fixes for jqm rendering on desktop browsers?
[16:53:07] <johnbender> mrmax: always
[16:53:11] <johnbender> mrmax: if they don't exist
[16:53:29] <gseguin> mrmax: totally interested
[16:53:36] <mrmax> Okay.  I introduced myself before, but I'm building a jQM drag and drop tool: http://codiqa.com
[16:53:49] <mrmax> and there's been some hacks I've had to make specific to desktop browsers
[16:54:11] <gseguin> imjoshdean: johnbender said "pester imjoshdean to commit tests" for his fixes
[16:54:14] <gseguin> :D
[16:54:25] <gseguin> if you have time that would be great
[16:54:40] <gseguin> I landed the fixes but I don't think there are tests for them
[16:54:47] <mrmax> If you wanna try it out, use this link: http://codiqa.com/beta/a/1
[16:55:06] <mrmax> That just lets you use it like the theme roller.  It just outputs HTML when you're done.  It's really early beta
[16:55:11] <johnbender> mrmax: if there's an existing issue I would file a pull request against that
[16:55:26] <johnbender> if not open one and THEN file a pull request :D
[16:55:26] <imjoshdean> gseguin: standby.
[16:55:33] <mrmax> johnbender, sounds good
[17:01:31] <gseguin> oh I know what's going on with the tests on master
[17:02:04] <gseguin> oh wait maybe not
[17:02:10] <johnbender> :(
[17:06:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: you do a damn good job of managing this project man
[17:06:03] <johnbender> and no mistake
[17:06:12] <johnbender> I've not said that before
[17:06:18] <johnbender> but in retrospect it's really true
[17:09:53] * gseguin goes to grab a beer
[17:14:28] <imjoshdean> Just a series of firsts for me, I guess
[17:14:38] <imjoshdean> first time doing any serious unit tests, first time using qunit
[17:15:01] <johnbender> imjoshdean: testing in javascript is an unfortunate introduction
[17:15:17] <johnbender> I think in your case you should be ok because there's nothing dynamic
[17:15:23] <johnbender> you can just add the fixtures and then move on with life
[17:16:15] <johnbender> no need to grok the async test stuff
[17:16:35] <imjoshdean> johnbender: Yeah man, it's just dipping the toe in the water, where I work unit tests are non existent
[17:16:54] <johnbender> imjoshdean: :(
[17:16:58] <johnbender> confidence
[17:17:05] <johnbender> it's made is of tests
[17:17:09] <johnbender> alright
[17:17:12] <johnbender> I'm signing off for the night
[17:17:18] <imjoshdean> g'night man.
[17:17:22] <imjoshdean> have a beer for me
[17:17:24] * johnbender waves
[17:24:07] <imjoshdean> gseguin: Thanks for making me do that unit test, found a problem with my solution. can't can't can't assume data-role
[17:27:33] <gseguin> imjoshdean: thank johnbender ;)
[17:27:39] <imjoshdean> I would but he left
[17:27:47] <imjoshdean> so you get the glory, this time
[17:28:09] <gseguin> :P
[17:30:49] <imjoshdean> ...I don't like american idol. Why am I watching it?
[17:35:56] <gseguin> no cable, best remedy to that problem
[17:42:35] <imjoshdean> gseguin: Submitted a pr for the button, not really sure how to write a unit test for the other one
[17:43:10] <gseguin> yeah the other one is kindda tricky to test
[17:45:04] <gseguin> for the future, it's best to do more atomic commits
[17:45:19] <gseguin> like one commit for your feature, one commit for your test
[17:45:25] <gseguin> imjoshdean: ^
[17:45:46] <imjoshdean> gseguin: alright.
[17:45:57] <gseguin> good catch on the data-role!
[17:46:14] <imjoshdean> gseguin: the unit test helped me catch it
[17:46:37] <imjoshdean> and yeah, I keep getting into the mentality of svn not git
[17:48:49] <gseguin> it helps to have smaller commits when you do a bisect
[17:49:14] * imjoshdean has no idea what that is, looks it up.
[17:49:45] <gseguin> it's basically a binary search through the commits to find when a bug got introduced
[17:50:08] <gseguin> or rather what commit introduced a bug
[17:50:26] <imjoshdean> fair enough, neat
[17:51:24] <gseguin> yeah git is awesome, little steep learning curve but you won't go back to svn after that
[17:51:56] <imjoshdean> Yeah, I'm growing ti like it the more I use it (which is really just with jqm right now)
[18:41:10] <johnbender> rwaldron: glad I could help out
[18:41:11] <johnbender> lol
[18:41:18] <johnbender> I was like "MUST FIND SOME WAY TO HELP"
[18:41:42] <imjoshdean> johnbender is back, now I can thank him for making me do unit tests
[18:59:42] <rwaldron> johnbender hell yeah dude
[19:01:25] <rwaldron> johnbender I wish more people would do that. shining example of the right way to do open source
[19:01:28] <rwaldron> ^5
