[01:00:15] <agcolom> hi all, in the new api docs, I need to document the event attributes in a way that is similar to this: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/4592d46f5821044af56d12d53d03d08abe250555/entries/accordion.xml#L93-111
[01:00:15] <agcolom> I am now looking at the code, and for the collapsible widget, would the ui objects be collapsibleHeading and collapsibleContent?
[01:08:26] <agcolom> Good morning Jasper!
[01:08:52] <uGoMobi> good morning Anne
[01:09:09] <agcolom> how are you? we've kept missing each other!!!!
[01:09:26] <uGoMobi> I am fine, thanks
[01:09:40] <agcolom> are you not taking any holidays?
[01:09:49] <uGoMobi> are you still in France?
[01:09:58] <agcolom> yes, until the 4th Sept
[01:10:17] <uGoMobi> not during summer months
[01:10:19] <agcolom> I'm at my parents' neat Aix en Provence.
[01:10:25] <uGoMobi> nice!
[01:10:26] <agcolom> near ^
[01:10:35] <agcolom> yes, some proper summer weather!
[01:10:51] <uGoMobi> :)
[01:10:56] <agcolom> will stay here until around the 23/24th
[01:11:09] <agcolom> then near Paris but will have no internet there....
[01:11:18] <uGoMobi> sounds great
[01:11:28] <uGoMobi> haha... ai ai no internet :(
[01:11:39] <uGoMobi> you will survive
[01:11:44] <agcolom> yes, I love being here!
[01:12:09] <agcolom> The bit near Paris no internet is terrible!!!!! but then it's a good way to be forced ti relax ;-)
[01:12:21] <agcolom> (then I can't check my work email)
[01:12:21] <uGoMobi> exactly
[01:13:02] <agcolom> I have a bug in the api docs... I cannot reproduce it in a jsbin! Do you have time to check?
[01:13:21] <uGoMobi> I can have a quick look
[01:14:14] <agcolom> ok, thank you.  I'll send you an email now to add something in your /etc/hosts
[01:14:59] <uGoMobi> ok
[01:16:14] <agcolom> email sent.
[01:17:32] <agcolom> (oh just remembered you're on windows? it will not be /etc/hosts then)
[01:20:49] <agcolom> Jasper, if you're on Windows, it could be Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
[01:21:26] <johnbender> see you guys in the morning :D
[01:21:43] <uGoMobi> good night johnbender :)
[01:21:44] <agcolom> Goodnight johnbender
[01:23:35] <agcolom> uGoMobi: once you're setup, if you go to http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/select/ you should see the page
[01:24:32] <agcolom> then move about a 3rd down (find Custom select menus)
[01:25:44] <agcolom> after this title, if you go to the second example (second example after the Custom select menus title), the one about states, it is example 10.
[01:26:32] <agcolom> the bug: I press the select, the long list of states comes up. I select one, and this causes a page refresh!
[01:29:47] <agcolom> right the bug only exists in Safari! FF is fine!!!! argh!!!!!
[01:30:57] <uGoMobi> I don't see anything strange here
[01:31:06] <uGoMobi> will try on FF now
[01:31:15] <agcolom> Yes, I've just realised it only appears in Safari!!!!
[01:31:24] <agcolom> Will see if there's a safari update!
[01:31:31] <agcolom> FF is fine for me!
[01:31:36] <agcolom> Jasper^
[01:31:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sorry, I meant will try on Safari now
[01:32:37] <agcolom> ok, thx :-) I'm on Safari 5.1.5
[01:35:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: don't see a refresh on Safari either (5.1.7 on Win)
[01:36:02] <agcolom> ok, thx. Will see if I can upgrade Safari! This is really weird! Thank you!
[01:36:14] <agcolom> other quick question:
[01:36:53] <agcolom> in the new api docs, I need to document the event attributes in a way that is similar to this: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/4592d46f5821044af56d12d53d03d08abe250555/entries/accordion.xml#L93-111
[01:37:23] <agcolom> I am now looking at the code, and for the collapsible widget, would the ui objects be collapsibleHeading and collapsibleContent? (for the create event)
[01:37:45] <agcolom> and it is the same ui objects for the other 2 events?
[01:38:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I was still testing on Safari... I have to say the dialog opens a bit slow
[01:39:05] <agcolom> ok, it is on a stage server, so not the real thing yet... this may affect the perf?
[01:39:40] <uGoMobi> yeah, maybe
[01:43:05] <agcolom> uGoMobi: did you see my other quick question ^
[01:43:07] <agcolom> ?
[01:43:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[01:44:03] <agcolom> ok, thx! are the ui objects be collapsibleHeading and collapsibleContent? (for the create event)
[01:48:02] <agcolom> also, I am thinking that these are not jQuery objects but jQuery Mobile objects?
[01:49:30] <agcolom> or would they still be jQuery obkects??
[01:49:36] <agcolom> objects^^^
[01:50:17] <uGoMobi> it's more a jQuery UI object
[01:50:26] <agcolom> ok, thx!
[01:50:42] <uGoMobi> am looking at the widget factory now
[01:50:56] <agcolom> ok, thank you v much!
[01:51:10] <uGoMobi> did you try with console.log to see if the object exists?
[01:51:42] <agcolom> No. I've only looked at the js file!
[01:53:00] <agcolom> jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.js
[01:55:14] <agcolom> I think I'll stick to jQuery as object type, as this seems to be the only option available (as listed under http://api.jquery.com/Types/)
[01:55:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you around?
[02:01:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't see a ui object in our code, but maybe I missed something
[02:05:43] <agcolom> uGoMobi: it's just that I was asked to document the event attributes, as  this is done for jQuery UI, see https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/4592d46f5821044af56d12d53d03d08abe250555/entries/accordion.xml#L93-111
[02:07:17] <agcolom> so when I looked at the create event for the collapsible, I thought there were 2 ui objects: collapsibleHeading and collapsibleContent
[02:07:56] <agcolom> but then, I'm not sure at all... If I can get one right and understand how to find the details, then I can get going....
[02:09:31] <agcolom> here is for example the doc for the create event of the jQuery UI collapsible: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/4592d46f5821044af56d12d53d03d08abe250555/entries/accordion.xml#L135-142
[08:00:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[08:00:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is there a class that's just like ui-body-a but no borders and margins?
[08:00:40] <_|Nix|_> ... or padding?
[09:27:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ui-overlay-a has bg color (no bg-image gradient) and no borders, margin or padding

[09:44:54] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi again :-) are we cherry-picking? (and if we are, what are we cherry-picking into?)
[09:45:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi, yes we are cherry-picking into 1.1-stable for 1.1.2 release
[09:46:08] <agcolom> ok, thank you!
[09:46:11] <uGoMobi> the same as we did for 1.1.1.
[09:46:28] <uGoMobi> np
[09:46:48] <agcolom> Cool!
[09:55:31] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I got a conflict. is the inset collapsible only coming in 1.2?
[09:55:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, that's for 1.2
[09:56:23] <uGoMobi> 1.1.2 will also only be bug fixes
[09:59:21] <agcolom> ok, so won't cherry-pick this one (unless I should do a manual change?) it's just about an icon in the example for the custom icon in expanded collapsible (arrow-d instead of arrow-r) Do you think I should add this change for 1.1.2 manually or leave it for 1.2?
[10:04:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: up to you, if it's just a small change you can do it in 1.1-stable branch directly and refer to the original commit on master
[10:05:35] <agcolom> ok, thanks, will add it then.

[10:18:09] * johnbender is buried under a mountain of base tag poop
[10:19:15] <agcolom> uGoMobi: just checking: custom icons in collapsibles and collapsible sets do not exist in 1.1.1 ?
[10:19:38] * uGoMobi hands johnbender a shovel
[10:20:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah looks like it http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/docs/content/content-collapsible.html
[10:21:56] <agcolom> no surprise I had a conflict ;-) I didn't remember this was a 1.2 feature!
[10:22:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: so I guess you don't have to change anything at all in 1.1-stable
[10:22:23] <uGoMobi> neither did I
[10:22:24] <agcolom> nope!
[10:25:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I should be using ui-overlay-* for popup, eh?
[10:26:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I dunno... for some use cases the border styling is nice
[10:26:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the bg gradient is not needed
[10:26:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: .ui-popup-screen sets border: 0; because it doesn't want the borders that ui-body-* brings.
[10:26:42] <agcolom> toddparker: not sure that's in your blog post about 1.2: new feature support for collapsible custom icons... (I have checked but cannot find this in your post)
[10:27:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but the border is not on ui-popup-screen, it's on ui-popup
[10:27:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's on ui-popup-screen as well, because the same div also gets ui-body-*
[10:28:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh ok, and then the bg is overriden by another rule
[10:28:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Might be - I'm not actually sure. ui-popup-screen may actually be getting the funky background - which may not be so good.
[10:29:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, I think the background is a gradient!
[10:29:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: at the other hand... if you set data-theme you expect bg gradient and border styling, not just the flat bg of ui-overlay
[10:29:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I should definitely switch to ui-overlay-*
[10:29:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm talking about data-overlay-theme though ...
[10:29:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The screen should not be getting a border or a gradient.
[10:30:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, get it
[10:30:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, so, like, I need to change this ...
[10:30:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true
[10:30:38] <uGoMobi> just bg color and opacity
[10:30:46] <toddmparker_> hi all - i'm on vacation this week so i'll be in here in fits
[10:30:51] <toddmparker_> how goes
[10:31:24] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: did you take a look at the popup focus issue when re-positioning?
[10:32:11] <toddmparker_> agcolom: no, it's not
[10:32:16] <toddmparker_> good catch. nice feature.
[10:32:24] <agcolom> Hi!
[10:32:25] <toddmparker_> i'll add it for the 1.2 final
[10:32:34] <toddmparker_> hi agcolom - working vacation huh?
[10:32:37] <toddmparker_> like mine
[10:32:46] <agcolom> yes! But this is not really work!
[10:32:57] <toddmparker_> nope. it's fun.
[10:33:04] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi and _|Nix|_
[10:33:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: hi
[10:33:09] <agcolom> exactly, and the view is great!
[10:33:16] <toddmparker_> ^^ we should use a flat color for the overlays
[10:33:29] <uGoMobi> yeah, _|Nix|_ is changing it
[10:33:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I did. I fixed it, AFAICT. Did you have a look at http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/clrpicker-demo/docs/forms/colorpickers/? Whaddya thing?
[10:34:03] <agcolom> toddmparker_: http://cl.ly/image/0d2Q0D451w0G that's very inspiring!
[10:34:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: s/thing/think/
[10:34:34] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: great! did that fix up those android issues with the keyboard and inputs?
[10:34:44] <toddmparker_> i can have wilto test if you need
[10:34:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I asked them to check and reopen if not.
[10:34:53] <Wilto> YOU’RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME
[10:34:54] <toddmparker_> did wp7 improve with that too?
[10:35:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Dunno, actually - good point.
[10:35:10] <Wilto> Should I get something a-chargin’? Catching up now.
[10:35:11] <uGoMobi> I am looking into the overflow hidden issues
[10:35:17] <toddmparker_> um, yes i am wilto.
[10:35:20] <toddmparker_> YA FIRED
[10:35:25] <Wilto> …yes okay technicallAW DAMMIT
[10:35:27] <toddmparker_> great uGoMobi
[10:35:30] <uGoMobi> but my notebook died :(
[10:35:32] <Wilto> —uh oh.
[10:35:34] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Check if you can type into the form popup example on Android 4.0
[10:35:41] <Wilto> Android/keyboard issues.
[10:35:46] <toddmparker_> all - are there things you need wilto to test for 1.2
[10:36:00] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: The issue is only on 4.0?
[10:36:25] <toddmparker_> yeah, in general, go to /test/ and try using the form example on all the androids, wp7.5 and maybe a newer nokia
[10:36:31] <toddmparker_> just ot be sure
[10:36:54] <Wilto> Yeah. I’ve seen a lot of input shenanigans on Android 2.x; I can recheck ’em.
[10:37:06] <Wilto> _Especially_ with alternate keyboards.
[10:37:45] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: wow, that is really cool
[10:38:05] <toddmparker_> on chrome/mac, the input opens a native picker now
[10:38:23] <toddmparker_> looks like the input needs to be sized...looks really tiny
[10:38:35] <toddmparker_> that is really slick tho
[10:39:20] <toddmparker_> what are the sliders? RGB?
[10:39:56] <toddmparker_> be cool to offer a HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) picker option. feel like my brain can grep that easier
[10:40:15] <toddmparker_> are you going to release this as a 3rd party widget soon?
[10:40:15] <Wilto> And a BSG option.
[10:40:26] <toddmparker_> be great to get this out in the world
[10:40:30] <toddmparker_> BSG?
[10:41:02] <uGoMobi> is it ok if I fix this on master for 1.2 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4835
[10:41:38] <uGoMobi> is socialhapy on vacation too?
[10:43:31] <uGoMobi> also, do we want the grid function to be mentioned in the docs?
[10:43:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: ^^
[10:43:54] <Wilto> 2.1 and 2.3 are looking solid. 4.0 and Win 7.5 are charging for a bit.
[10:45:38] <toddmparker_> great wilto
[10:46:14] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: if that is just a small syntax tweak, i suppose it's fine to fix it
[10:46:20] <toddmparker_> updating the docs would be great
[10:46:35] <toddmparker_> i didn't even remember there was a script for grids
[10:46:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes it is and I tested it
[10:46:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: same here
[10:46:53] <uGoMobi> I thought it was only used for the navbar
[10:47:07] <uGoMobi> but you can use it for any grid
[10:47:21] <uGoMobi> quite handy if you inject content
[10:50:48] <toddmparker_> yeah, it is
[10:53:18] <Wilto> Android 4.0 turned on and promptly died. Please hold.
[10:54:12] <toddmparker_> Wilto: can you try a nexus 7 too
[10:54:17] <Wilto> Sure can.
[10:55:47] <Wilto> I really might buy one of these. Like, on purpose.
[10:55:58] <toddmparker_> i know, they are nice
[10:56:14] <toddmparker_> mat - might need you to test this on a WP7 and Nokia - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4784#issuecomment-7684521
[10:56:29] <toddmparker_> and see if you or the rest of the crew have any theories
[10:56:35] <toddmparker_> it's a blocker for 1.2
[10:58:15] <Wilto> Busted in Chrome on the N7.
[10:58:32] <Wilto> Popping up the keyboard seems to fire a resize event.
[10:58:56] <Wilto> So, the popup moves, the input loses focus, the keyboard hides itself, and the popup moves back into place sans keyboard.
[10:59:41] <toddmparker_> right
[10:59:59] <toddmparker_> Gabriel said he addressed that but I think it needs another look
[11:00:37] <toddmparker_> if an input has focus, we want to avoid shifting focus when we re-position on orientation change. I can see that causing all kinds of badness
[11:02:27] <toddmparker_> be back in a while
[11:03:21] <uGoMobi> maybe we should use a bit more CSS and less JS for the resizing
[11:03:34] <Wilto> Oh, so that’s potentially fixed but not in /test?
[11:03:35] <uGoMobi> Wilto: didn't you already look into that?
[11:03:39] <Wilto> uGoMobi: +100.
[11:04:08] <Wilto> I haven’t yet, no. I think some CSS vertical centering trickiness might work well here, though.
[11:05:22] <Wilto> I mean… Something like `.popup { top: 50%; left: 50%; }`, and then a little JS to calculate the height and width of the container, divide them by half, and apply a top/left negative margin of those values. Boom: centered.
[11:05:35] <uGoMobi> will give that a look if I got my gear up and running again :(
[11:05:50] <uGoMobi> Wilto: exactly
[11:07:20] <uGoMobi> Wilto: the popup container has position absolute and display inline-block so maybe vertical center can be done with text-align... not sure though
[11:07:33] <Wilto> Not without display: table-cell shenanigans.
[11:07:44] <uGoMobi> right
[11:08:02] <Wilto> And that’s… probably not something I’d use in code other people will be applying in creative ways, y’know?
[11:08:11] <Wilto> It always gets weird if it’s not handled carefully.
[11:08:30] <Wilto> Moreso the fact that you need a `display: table` parent, and those behave in all sorts of strange ways.
[11:09:11] <uGoMobi> actually I added a clearfix like that for the controlgroup
[11:09:57] <uGoMobi> bit different though
[11:17:54] <djbpython> i'm using degradeInputs to degrade a type=date, however it is rendered as a regular input box and not a mobile input box
[11:21:15] <_|Nix|_> [6~
[11:21:44] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I already have an HSV slider in web-ui-fw: http://web-ui-fw.github.com/#hsvpicker-demo
[11:23:02] <johnbender> djbpython: working as expected
[11:23:07] <johnbender> djbpython: we don't have a  date picker
[11:23:23] <johnbender> djbpython: have you tried it without degrading the input
[11:23:24] <johnbender> ?
[11:23:34] <johnbender> djbpython: also, this is a better question for #jquerymobile
[11:23:53] <djbpython> johnbender, ah, sorry
[11:24:14] <djbpython> I'm using the jquery mobile datepicker lib, so I need to degrade dates
[11:24:26] <johnbender> djbpython: not supported :(
[11:24:44] <djbpython> johnbender, what isn't supported?
[11:24:48] <johnbender> djbpython: datepicker
[11:25:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: So, I could port that one over.
[11:25:19] <djbpython> johnbender, there is a 3rd party lib for jquery mobile http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/experiments/ui-datepicker/
[11:25:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Assuming we wanna have a colour widget in jQM.
[11:25:40] <johnbender> djbpython: we've removed the experiment and we don't support it
[11:25:50] <johnbender> if you want to keep using it, it's entirely up to you :(
[11:26:00] <djbpython> johnbender, however, I don't think it is really related. If I don't include it the problem still persists
[11:26:24] <johnbender> djbpython: if you don't include it the input should be degraded to use the native widget, that is - it should be ignored
[11:26:44] <johnbender> sorry, if you use degradeInputs with type=data
[11:26:46] <johnbender> *date
[11:26:51] <johnbender> it should degrade the input
[11:27:05] <johnbender> unless I've misunderstood what you're saying
[11:27:53] <djbpython> johnbender, right, I appreciate your patience, I should move this to #jquerymobile though
[11:27:59] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I will give that CSS solution for popups a try later on this week
[11:28:04] <johnbender> djbpython: ok, good luck
[11:28:12] <Wilto> Sounds good to me, uGoMobi.
[11:28:19] <Wilto> Let me know if you want me to tag in.
[11:28:37] <uGoMobi> Wilto: yeah I will
[11:29:05] <uGoMobi> Wilto: will let you know when I have something that you can give a look and maybe test on a few devices
[11:30:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm afraid phantomjs is broken once more :(
[11:31:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: in what way
[11:31:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Same old, same old :(
[11:31:56] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So, is text-input-inside-popup still broken in Android 4.0?
[11:31:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: timeout?
[11:32:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yep :(
[11:32:05] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Yeah.
[11:32:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you might try my original solution
[11:32:26] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Weird ... I shouldn't be doing any focus juggling anymore.
[11:32:42] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: What commitid are you at?
[11:32:44] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Oh, it’s the resize.
[11:33:11] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I know - I used to transfer focus away at the beginning of the resize, and reapply focus at the end of the resize.
[11:33:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: wrap a timeout around that puppy https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/jquery.testHelper.js#L22
[11:33:49] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: At the end, I would reapply focus to the popup container -> possibly taking focus away from the input inside the container.
[11:34:02] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: But this (mis)behaviour should now be yanked.
[11:35:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Same timeout ... :(
[11:36:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and the tests work fine when loaded into the browser?
[11:36:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can you paste the command you're using?
[11:36:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yep.
[11:36:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ./node_modules/.bin/grunt lint && JUNIT_OUTPUT=build/test-results/ ROOT_DOMAIN=http://localhost/nix/jqm/jquery-mobile node_modules/.bin/grunt test
[11:37:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: try a trailing slash on the root_domain
[11:37:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[11:37:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's the key.
[11:37:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Works now. Thanks!
[11:38:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I should add some checks in there :(
[11:40:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will look into using more CSS and JS to handle the positioning of the popup
[11:41:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That trailing slash has dogged the WWW since its beginning.
[11:41:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this way we might be able to avoid the focus issue
[11:42:00] <uGoMobi> more CSS and less JS *
[11:42:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: By all means ...
[11:43:40] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... this sux0rz ... I have exactly one Android device at my disposal, but if I upgrade it to Android 4.x, I lose Android 2.3.5 ...
[11:44:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and my experience with upgrading from 2.3 to 4.0 aren't very positive :(

[13:35:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fix-4784] [popup] Record window offset when acquiring nav hook and scroll to it after the popup has been closed - Gabriel Schulhof
[13:36:07] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So, I've had some minor success with #4784 if I record the window offset when I set up the history entry, and scroll to the recorded offset when I'm subsequently told there's been a hashchange.
[13:36:14] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: ^^
[13:36:42] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: The problem is, it scrolls to whereever it wants and then it scrolls to where I tell it.
[13:37:58] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: ... and the call to window.scrollTo() has to be delayed, because if I do it synch, the call runs before whatever native(?) call to go back to whatever dumb location it wants.
[13:38:33] <_|Nix|_> I don't really know what drives it to scroll like that in the first place, though.
[13:51:56] <djbpython> I have a page with a button that opens a dialog via js changePage, the dialog has a button which submits a form via js changePage. If the form has errors the page is returned, but the submit button can no longer open the dialog because its not in the dom because of ajax loading
[13:52:34] <djbpython> ah, wrong channel
