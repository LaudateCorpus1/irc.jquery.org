[07:24:37] <toddparker> I just pulled in this from rick waldron: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2184
[07:24:41] <toddparker> scott gave it a look
[09:12:23] <_nickel> toddparker: kinblas: gseguin: I'm going to start the decoupled-select rebase onto master are we cool with minimizing changes to the select for a while?
[09:12:35] <_nickel> I can always cherry pick commits as necessary before the merge, just nothing too big
[09:13:06] * kinblas is clueless
[09:13:40] <kinblas> is this a decoupling as was done with the other components?
[09:14:00] * kinblas notes he's still struggling to catch up with stuff
[09:14:07] <rwaldron> toddparker i'm getting close to taking you up on that offer to dig into regular contribution
[09:14:16] <rwaldron> when are you at the bocoup loft next?
[09:14:31] <_nickel> kinblas: just seperating custom and native selects
[09:14:40] <kinblas> _nickel: ah ok
[09:14:43] <_nickel> instead of having all these `if native`
[09:14:59] <kinblas> _nickel: I likey
[09:15:28] <kinblas> _nickel: that will allow folks that never use custom select to leave it out for better download size
[09:18:06] <_nickel> kinblas: I'm doing it incrementally so I'm first splitting everything up into seperate bits and then I'll pull it into seperate widgets
[09:18:21] <_nickel> origin/decoupled-select if you're interested
[09:23:22] <kinblas> toddparker: _nickel: gseguin: FYI, I'm back but distracted by some internal stuff I need to get done today. I'll hopefully be back focused on JQM later today or tomorrow.
[09:31:36] <_nickel> kinblas: gseguin: toddparker: pushing the rebase, please let me know if you want to commit something that affects select
[10:00:04] <gseguin> _nickel: not commiting anything that affects select
[10:00:16] <gseguin> _nickel: thanks for the congrats
[10:00:29] <gseguin> we're due Oct 7th
[10:03:53] <_nickel> gseguin: hmm well I might be too late with my unsolicited advice, but if I were you, which I was, I would start staying up late every night
[10:04:00] <_nickel> gseguin: 6 hours of sleep tops
[10:04:17] <_nickel> I was really well conditioned when the baby came
[10:05:02] <gseguin> _nickel: this is number 2, I know ;)
[10:05:13] <_nickel> gseguin: ahh! silly asumption on my part
[10:05:24] <_nickel> gseguin: double congrats! :D
[10:05:28] <gseguin> thanks
[10:23:43] <_nickel> hah looks like I'm scheduled right next to another talk on testing for jqcon boston
[10:23:58] <_nickel> YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
[10:27:44] <gseguin> :)
[11:32:14] <_nickel> toddparker: is scott floating around I have a question for him
[11:32:20] <_nickel> I've been spinning my wheels a bit
[11:59:25] <_nickel> gseguin: kinblas: toddparker: question for any and all of you
[11:59:43] <_nickel> we've had this issue on and off for a while now as I've worked with the select
[11:59:48] <_nickel> I think I've fixed the bug at least twice
[12:00:31] <_nickel> hmm one sec
[12:00:33] <_nickel> I had a thought
[12:00:39] <kinblas> what's the bug?
[12:01:46] <_nickel> dialog sized custom select comes up as a dialog
[12:01:51] <_nickel> then comes up as an overlay menu
[12:02:03] <_nickel> we calculate the height based on the parent
[12:02:18] <_nickel> but the parent changes over time
[12:02:52] <_nickel> initially the hiddent select menu is offscreen but visible so the height calculation is accurate
[12:03:00] <_nickel> then after its in the dialog
[12:03:19] <_nickel> the dialog is hidden but onscreen so the calculation is super small
[12:03:32] <_nickel> I'm going to look how head works with this
[12:03:33] <_nickel> brb
[12:03:37] <_nickel> *HEAD
[12:04:06] <kinblas> _nickel: is the parent being cached in the widget?
[12:04:33] <_nickel> no its queried each time open() is called
[12:04:44] <_nickel> one possible solution is doing the calculation on refresh
[12:05:12] <_nickel> but I was having trouble with that and I'm trying to move through this with a minimum of intrusion to how the selects actually work
[12:06:41] <_nickel> kinblas: ok the parent is consistent on HEAD
[12:07:02] <_nickel> kinblas: which guarantees the corrent height calculation
[12:07:08] <_nickel> just need to sort out the difference
[12:07:14] <_nickel> between HEAD and what I'm working with
[12:36:39] <_nickel> kinblas: success
[12:36:51] <_nickel> kinblas: diff tool
[12:36:57] <_nickel> why do I even waste my time
[12:38:46] <kinblas> heh
[12:39:46] <_nickel> gseguin: kinblas: toddparker: https://github.com/johnbender/jquery-mobile/tree/decoupled-select
[12:39:54] <_nickel> after the rebase I'm posting my changes there until the merge
[12:53:04] <scottjehl> hey _nickel
[12:53:15] <scottjehl> I'll push a branch
[12:54:19] <scottjehl> I've got Nokia s60s all rendering jQM today, opted out of Ajax navigation though methods that could get my best practices card revoked
[13:09:30] <_nickel> scottjehl: yay! I'm glad I could guilt you into joining us :D
[13:09:52] <_nickel> scottjehl: so it only runs the css onload or what?
[13:10:06] <scottjehl> sorry. been buried in symbian hell
[13:10:06] <_nickel> scottjehl: if its super involved feel free to point me at the source
[13:10:10] <_nickel> scottjehl: :(
[13:10:17] <scottjehl> heh. I'll push in to a branch
[13:10:51] <scottjehl> we need to opt all symbian webkits out of ajax navigation, due to their broken history model
[13:11:30] <toddparker> woah, is that the tanned and refreshed kinblas??
[13:11:34] <toddparker> welcome back
[13:12:01] <scottjehl> kinblas? :)
[13:15:08] <_nickel> yah he's back but he's burried on internal stuff
[13:15:17] * _nickel notes the Edge preview release
[13:15:36] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddparker: http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/01/adobes-edge-tool-promises-flash-like-animation-through-html5/
[13:15:39] <_nickel> if you're interested
[13:15:41] <_nickel> I know I was :D
[13:16:23] <scottjehl> yeah, all that stuff looks really great. congrats to you all :)
[13:16:37] * _nickel flexes
[13:16:56] <_nickel> yah
[13:17:05] <_nickel> pretty awesome stuff
[13:17:11] <_nickel> which I had nothing to do with
[13:17:14] <toddparker> yeah, really cool stuff
[13:17:31] <_nickel> makes me super proud actually
[13:17:33] <_nickel> very weird
[13:18:59] <_nickel> alright! back to the refactor
[13:19:12] <_nickel> the rebase went ok and all the tests are passing on my personal branch
[13:24:40] <toddparker> great
[13:25:01] <scottjehl> this is.. select?
[13:25:32] <toddparker> this is the bug where the long custom select opens as a dialog first time, overlay second time, right?
[14:02:57] <_nickel> toddparker: yes we have a small snippet that puts the ul back inside its original container
[14:03:09] <_nickel> toddparker: that went missing during my refactor on the decoupled-select branch
[14:03:13] <_nickel> had to add it back in
[14:03:29] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: also I logged a new bug https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2194
[14:03:32] <_nickel> I'll handle that
[14:03:40] <_nickel> push it to master and cherry pick the change over
[14:04:11] <_nickel> scottjehl: I assume the multple small custom select should disappear when the `screen` is clicked?
[14:29:10] <_nickel> it constantly amazes me how refactoring helps you grok code
[16:05:20] <scottjehl> hey sorry - FG's internet connection got knocked out
[16:05:26] <scottjehl> had to head home
[17:39:32] <scottjehl> hey _nickel
[17:39:43] <_nickel> scottjehl: yo!
[17:40:00] <scottjehl> saw your tweet. glad to hear that's coming along!
[17:40:09] <_nickel> scottjehl: yah thats what I've been spending most of my time on
[17:40:11] <_nickel> tests are going in
[17:40:11] <scottjehl> It'll be great to not have to include that part of the js
[17:40:21] <scottjehl> awesome
[17:41:08] <scottjehl> I'd like to do the same for nested lists. I think they'll actually be quite easy though, as all of that is basically contained in a single method
[17:41:23] <scottjehl> (comparatively easy) :)
[17:41:47] <_nickel> my strategy of splitting it into 3 objects is proving to be effective
[17:41:53] <_nickel> then I can just toss those bits around
[17:41:59] <scottjehl> great
[17:44:02] <scottjehl> quick nokia update?
[17:45:51] <scottjehl> this is the main commit to get Symbian webkit up and running, and opted out of ajax https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/e9debe595dbc7502654626117e96412ca5cc4809
[17:48:57] <scottjehl> I should add that this is my least favorite commit in the whole codebase :/
[17:49:28] <scottjehl> but… it does make things usable in a boatload of popular devices
[17:50:22] <_nickel> scottjehl: oh noes
[17:50:30] <_nickel> well
[17:50:32] <_nickel> if we have to
[17:51:13] <scottjehl> I looped the window object, fished around… there's really nothing exposed about it that identifies it
[17:52:26] <scottjehl> and actually feature detecting this bug just isn't possible.
[17:53:29] <scottjehl> creating a history entry kills forward history (minor), and also these browsers cap the history array at 50 length and just start shifting items out
[17:53:48] <scottjehl> so checking length after a change can't be relied upon
[17:54:34] <_nickel> ugh
[17:54:36] <scottjehl> anyway… I also checked with the Nokia dev del and he confirmed there's nothing exposed for us to use
[17:55:10] <scottjehl> he recommended possibly checking a combination of lack of trim() support with a shady canvas implementation
[17:55:17] <scottjehl> heh. sounds like all sorts of browsers
[17:55:43] <scottjehl> and super weak for this sort of thing
[17:56:18] <scottjehl> anyway. we need to make this bulletproof.
[17:58:57] <scottjehl> I spent today making sure it does what we need on all the nokia devices at FG, without affecting other browsers
[17:59:35] <scottjehl> I guess I'm thinking it'd be good to have you and some others just check my logic and then we can drop it into master and have people test it on their phones in the wild
[17:59:46] <scottjehl> (soooo many devices in this category)
[18:50:01] <scottjehl> hey _nickel
[18:50:05] <scottjehl> sorry, dropped off
[18:51:51] <scottjehl> saw your comment, responded
[18:52:06] <scottjehl> (thanks) :)
[18:56:06] <scottjehl> k I'm gonna drop off - worked too late last night, tired :/
[18:56:09] <scottjehl> see ya
