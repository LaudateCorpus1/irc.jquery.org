[10:03:59] <agcolom> hi Everyone :) happy Thanksgiving! Do we have meeting today?
[10:04:27] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Good point ...
[10:04:48] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: seems all really quiet here today :)
[10:10:12] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... there might not be a meeting at all ...
[10:18:09] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes, the content meeting is not taking place... so this one also may not happen...
[10:18:18] <agcolom> I guess people are with family etc.
[10:28:07] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[11:09:13] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #5318: Garbage shows up behind a dialog  02http://git.io/YwJlTw
[11:09:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[11:15:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[11:42:26] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[11:42:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Have you seen this before: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5318?
[11:43:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no
[11:43:16] <uGoMobi> never tested it either
[11:43:22] <_|Nix|_> Weird ...
[11:43:43] <_|Nix|_> I was looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2215 ... it's not really about page sections at all, but about re-creating a dialog.
[11:44:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Check this out: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/534/
[11:44:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It correctly re-creates the dialog, but it suffers from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5318 and a themeing glitch.
[11:44:55] <uGoMobi> hmm
[11:45:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Implementing _destroy() on page and dialog would help immensely ...
[11:46:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but it kinda works even now.
[11:46:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the dialog shoud have ui-overlay-a
[11:46:46] <uGoMobi> *should
[11:46:53] <uGoMobi> the class is there
[11:47:06] <uGoMobi> but I don't see the CSS rules in the inspector
[11:48:17] <uGoMobi> correction... I see the rules now
[11:48:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you repeatedly open and close the dialog, it toggles between correct themeing and incorrect themeing.
[11:52:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's the same with 1.2.0
[11:53:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and 1.1.1
[11:53:17] <uGoMobi> so the bug has always been there
[11:55:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Good. That also means the solution to re-creating dialogs has also always been there.
[11:57:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the problem with header not being enhanced is same as with popup
[11:57:20] <uGoMobi> page.sections widget has no binding to "create"
[11:57:25] <uGoMobi> only "pagecreate"
[11:57:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but if you re-create something that contains a header/footer, it will be re-enhanced.
[11:58:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, I just made it work for the dialog.
[11:59:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2215
[11:59:15] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's the one I just commented on.
[11:59:30] <_|Nix|_> It's not about the header/footer at all.
[12:00:08] <uGoMobi> I see
[12:03:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if we can figure out why the theme keeps toggling back and forth and fix that, we'll officially have recreateable dialogs.
[12:11:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you in what file the code is that adds the ui-overlay-* class for body / .ui-mobile-viewport?
[12:12:00] <uGoMobi> s/do you/do you know/
[12:13:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: dialog.js or page.js ...
[12:14:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... I assume ...
[12:14:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Where does the dark background come from?
[12:15:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I get background-color: transparent ...
[12:15:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, in there we add the overlay class for page/dialog
[12:15:35] <uGoMobi> but there is one behind the page/dialog, added to the body element
[12:15:42] <uGoMobi> that's the one that is toggling
[12:16:15] <uGoMobi> I was looking in transitions.js but didn't see it
[12:16:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, it's added to the body! Wow!
[12:16:59] <uGoMobi> yeah, I believe scottjehl added that to improve transitions
[12:17:20] <uGoMobi> I think it was changed in 1.1.0
[12:17:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wow! It toggles between ui-overlay-c ui-overlay-a and ui-overlay-a ...
[12:17:45] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:18:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So in one case the ui-overlay-c is not removed.
[12:18:27] <uGoMobi> something is going wrong there
[12:19:02] <uGoMobi> will search for ui-overlay in the code
[12:19:46] <_|Nix|_> page.js:removeContainerBackground()
[12:20:28] <_|Nix|_> The theme inheritance is failing again, I suspect.
[12:21:06] <uGoMobi> ah that's the one
[12:23:24] <uGoMobi> yeah looks like getInheritedTheme problem
[12:24:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the close button is also not inheriting header theme since you made that button optiona
[12:24:15] <uGoMobi> *optional
[12:26:00] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... 
[12:26:05] <_|Nix|_> Let's fix that first.
[12:26:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we need to give https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5113 more priority
[12:28:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono ... the dialog button problem is simple. I'm calling .buttonMarkup() before I insert the button into the DOM, so it searches in vain for an inherited theme. Despite that, I agree, but I also suspect that solving getInheritedTheme will not be easy, and it will be even more complicated if we start working with on-the-fly options.
[12:28:41] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:28:52] <uGoMobi> yeah I agree it won't be simple
[12:29:06] <uGoMobi> didn't know it was easier to fix it for the dialog button
[12:31:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: heading out.. will be here all day tomorrow so let me know if there is something you want me to look into
[12:32:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: goodnight!
[12:33:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: L8R
