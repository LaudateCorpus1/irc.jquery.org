[01:57:18] <aaronmcadam> Shizu, read the rules, no PMs
[08:26:54] <gseguin> good morning
[09:15:15] <gseguin> miketaylr: ping
[09:15:48] <miketaylr> gseguin: pong
[09:15:55] <gseguin> good morning
[09:16:09] <gseguin> I'm working on the transition thing on jQM
[09:16:10] <miketaylr> hiya
[09:16:15] <miketaylr> ah, nice
[09:16:25] <gseguin> our support detection is testing for
[09:16:31] <gseguin>  "OTransitionEvent" in window
[09:16:37] <gseguin> that returns false
[09:16:54] <miketaylr> yeah, we don't expose OTransitionEvent...nobody does except for Webkit
[09:17:04] <miketaylr> one sec
[09:17:18] <gseguin> hmm, better route for feature detection?
[09:18:01] <miketaylr> did you see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1883#issuecomment-1477384 ?
[09:18:16] <gseguin> I did not
[09:18:46] <gseguin> thanks
[09:18:55] <miketaylr> np
[10:43:46] <toddparker> gseguin - landing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1993 seems ok to me
[10:43:49] <toddparker> go for it
[10:44:05] <gseguin> alright
[10:44:30] <gseguin> done
[11:06:14] <gseguin> miketaylr: do you have a couple minutes?
[11:06:23] <miketaylr> sure what's up
[11:06:39] <gseguin> http://jsbin.com/uyemel/10
[11:06:57] <gseguin> that works perfectly on Webkit and Firefox
[11:07:08] <gseguin> and behaves really weirdly on Opera
[11:07:16] <miketaylr> yeah it kinda flashes
[11:07:40] <gseguin> I wonder if there is anything obvious that I don't see
[11:09:22] <miketaylr> let me take a peek, i might rope in divya as well
[11:09:34] <gseguin> cool, thanks a lot
[11:21:46] <miketaylr> gseguin: nothing jumps out to me as wrong--so i filed DSK-341845 and cc'd core compat and one of our CSS dudes
[11:22:00] <miketaylr> they're pretty quick at responding...maybe i'll have something better to say tomorrow?
[11:22:29] <gseguin> great! Thank you! did you cc me in the ticket?
[11:23:01] <gseguin> is there a way I can keep an eye on it?
[11:23:17] <miketaylr> sadly no :(
[11:23:24] <miketaylr> but i'll let you know any progress
[11:23:39] <gseguin> sounds good
[11:23:44] <gseguin> thank you
[11:23:45] <miketaylr> we're in the progress of trying to open up our bug tracker
[11:23:56] <miketaylr> not quite there yet
[13:31:29] <toddparker> _nickel - any chance you'd have time to help write some new unit tests for us?
