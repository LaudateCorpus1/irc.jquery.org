[07:27:50] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added more info on how to add custom and HD icons - toddparker
[07:30:01] <toddmparker_> kinblas - i added your custom transition info from the wiki and re-vamped this page: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[07:30:18] <toddmparker_> PhoneGap page: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/phonegap.html
[07:30:35] <toddmparker_> New touchOverflow docs: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/touchoverflow.html
[07:30:48] <toddmparker_> Please read and edit!
[07:31:56] <toddmparker_> Also added more info on creating custom icons here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-icons.html
[07:32:11] <toddmparker_> These were the big docs things i wanted to add before 1.0
[07:32:20] <toddmparker_> missing anything important?
[08:21:48] <Wilto> Lookin’ good from here.

[08:22:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> todd: Added more info on how to add custom and HD icons
[08:24:26] <kinblas> toddmparker_: thanks for pickin' up my doc slack
[08:26:06] <toddmparker_> heh. my pleasure
[08:26:16] <toddmparker_> kinblas: got this on twitter on perf
[08:26:18] <toddmparker_> I say any page where the webkit layer gets trashed ontouchstart (e.g. starting to scroll listviews). But I'll make you a test.
[08:26:25] <toddmparker_> Not slimmed down yet, but you can take a look at: botanicus.nu/mobile/a-z.html. Lagging starts when the "button down" effect kicks in.
[08:26:35] <toddmparker_> that is a long page, big listview
[08:26:58] <toddmparker_> pretty much what we already know, right
[08:27:27] <kinblas> toddmparker_: there was one more thing that I remember was a big discussion in an issue on my plate or on johnbender's, don't remember ... but it had to do with a problem with jQuery Core and having to write some sort of callback  to get around the fact that file:// was returning a zero status which looked like things failed
[08:27:48] <kinblas> I'm not sure if it was addressed in Core already (with the version we distribute) or if it is still a problem
[08:27:57] * kinblas tries to search for the issue
[08:28:35] <kinblas> toddmparker_: do we have a page dedicated to pushstate and the potential problems?
[08:28:39] <kinblas> how to turn it off?
[08:31:00] <kinblas> toddmparker_: regarding the phonegap-blackberry issue I raised, we may want to link to this bug https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1908
[08:31:00] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1908 on jquery-mobile, reported by adambiggs (4m, 2w ago): BB5 - Fix for jQuery.ajax "no transport" error
[08:34:31] <kinblas> toddmparker_: aha found it ... it's a an $.ajaxPrefilter thing mentioned here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1579
[08:34:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1579 on jquery-mobile, reported by jammus (6m, 6d ago): 'Error loading page' when opening a page specified in appcache manifest (iPhone)
[08:35:36] <kinblas> jquery Core version of bug http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8412
[08:36:20] <toddmparker_> so kinblas - should we link to both of those?
[08:36:47] <kinblas> I think it's worth mentioning them since they mentione workarounds ... the core bug was closed as won't fix
[08:36:52] <toddmparker_> and are the ajaxPrefilter a new topic to add to the bottom
[08:37:19] <toddmparker_> are these small enough you'd be ok adding the set and links?
[08:37:30] <toddmparker_> feel like you can explain mo betta
[08:37:34] <kinblas> heh
[08:37:45] <kinblas> this is more a topic for application-manifest
[08:37:48] <toddmparker_> hey all - i posted kin's cool research on webkit rendering here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Mobile-Safari-rendering-info
[08:37:50] <kinblas> which I don't think we cover at all eh?
[08:37:55] <toddmparker_> yeah, thought so
[08:38:12] <toddmparker_> do we have enough info on that topic to warrant a page?
[08:38:32] <kinblas> well, I guess folks associate it with mobile so perhaps we need a warning
[08:38:42] <kinblas> and maybe a forward to that bug
[08:41:42] <kinblas> toddmparker_: perhaps we should get johnbender to chime in on documenting https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1579
[08:41:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1579 on jquery-mobile, reported by jammus (6m, 6d ago): 'Error loading page' when opening a page specified in appcache manifest (iPhone)
[08:42:16] <kinblas> he did some experiments, which I have not, so he might have some insight ... he refers to something remaining as the workaround, but I'm a bit confused as to which proposed one he is referring to.
[08:43:01] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so that was the only detail/problem weighing on me... otherwise I think we look great!

[08:51:59] <toddmparker_> so what do you think we should do for appcache?
[08:52:17] <kinblas> toddmparker_: document what we know
[08:52:25] <kinblas> it don't work right
[08:52:27] <kinblas> :-)
[08:54:53] <Wilto> “S’broke.”
[08:55:38] <Wilto> I don’t know if I could even begin to document all the issues with appcache _outside_ of jQuery Mobile.
[08:57:42] <toddmparker_> yea

[09:34:50] <johnbender> luckily I spent about 20 mins before realizing this was an issue with an experiment
[09:34:58] <johnbender> should I even bother at this point?
[09:35:27] <kinblas> johnbender: nah
[09:35:34] <kinblas> focus on the real-stuff
[09:35:35] <johnbender> thats what I thought
[09:35:42] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2948
[09:35:42] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (5d, 19h ago): Fix for #2947: ui-btn-hover is not removed when mouse down
[09:36:04] <johnbender> toddparker: nevermind I see that you responded
[09:36:46] <johnbender> toddparker: do you or wilto want to deal with that one, it's a JS issue but should button hover be removed when mousedown is fired?
[09:38:22] <johnbender> kinblas: I think I'm going to close the scrollview bug. If we start working on that directly I imagine we'll encounter the issue described there
[09:39:39] <kinblas> johnbender: I hate closing stuff like that we should have a bucket for deferred, or a tag for experiment or something
[09:39:48] <kinblas> they are valid problems, I guess that's why I hate that we close them
[09:41:49] <johnbender> kinblas: we've got an issue logged now that I tagged with low priority
[09:42:09] <garann> these docs pages.. should we be checking in copy edits?
[09:43:00] <johnbender> kinblas: that references the issue directly so I'm tempted to close it to clean up our pr queue
[09:43:14] <kinblas> garann: what do you mean by copy edits?
[09:43:21] <garann> proofreading stuff
[09:43:26] <kinblas> johnbender: ok
[09:43:36] <kinblas> garann: if you see mistakes, by all means
[09:43:37] <johnbender> garann: yah that would be brilliant
[09:43:44] <garann> cool
[09:43:54] <johnbender> garann: keep them to small commits if it's judgement stuff though so we can pick and choose what we want
[09:44:06] <kinblas> garann: some of us are engieers, so we dnot spaek or right well
[09:44:12] <garann> cool, will do
[09:44:19] <johnbender> I mean I can always go back and select the diff hunks myself but it makes life easier
[09:44:20] <garann> kinblas: syntax is syntax, yo ;)
[09:44:24] <kinblas> lol
[09:45:03] <kinblas> johnbender: I guess what I get concerned about is the message it sends
[09:45:17] <kinblas> the other kind of "PR" :-)
[09:47:11] <kinblas> the touch on the WP7.5 phone feels so solid
[09:47:39] <johnbender> kinblas: agreed, but on some level I think it's worse to just let it sit
[09:47:45] <johnbender> it makes us look disengaged
[09:47:56] <johnbender> so you say something nice, tag the issue, and close the pr
[09:47:58] <johnbender> we'll come back to it
[09:48:01] <kinblas> agreed
[09:48:20] <johnbender> toddparker: whats the best way to get an email to Scott?
[09:48:34] <johnbender> I have a super simple question that I want to run by him
[09:50:56] <garann> WebView or Web View?
[09:52:00] <johnbender> garann: UIWebView on iOS
[09:52:17] <johnbender> gseguin: WebView on android
[09:52:20] <johnbender> those are the actual class names
[09:52:44] <garann> that's confusing - i will just not mess with it :)
[09:54:03] <garann> omg n/m it's in here three different ways
[09:54:21] <garann> so WebView seems like it would generically cover all cases?
[09:56:52] <johnbender> garann: you can define a third representation at the top of the text
[09:57:09] <johnbender> UIWebView or WebView, hereafter referred to as webview
[09:57:12] <johnbender> or some such
[09:57:19] <johnbender> thats one posibility
[09:57:46] <johnbender> it's accurate and most people will know "webview" anyway
[09:58:02] <garann> ah, ok
[09:58:08] <garann> thanks johnbender
[10:04:28] * johnbender knows how to bikeshed
[10:04:45] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/bikeshed.jpg
[10:05:32] <garann> sorry, didn't mean to be bikesheddy :(

[10:08:38] <toddmparker_> to get scott's attention, just send an email with HIGH PRIORITY -
[10:08:47] <toddmparker_> in the subject
[10:09:12] <toddmparker_> so where did we hand with the decoupling of the collapsibles?

[10:09:25] <toddmparker_> think i missed some of the conversation
[10:13:06] <Wilto> Yeah, likewise—is there anything specific in there you want me to review, gseguin?
[10:14:12] <Wilto> gseguin: Was it for a specific reason (like performance or somesuch), or just to have it decoupled? Not that I’m opposed to decoupling.

[10:43:05] <toddmparker_> kinblas: that new data looks much more consistent
[10:43:07] <toddmparker_> great
[10:43:55] <kinblas> toddmparker_: happy?
[10:44:09] <toddmparker_> heck yeah
[10:44:09] <kinblas> WP7.5 is actually a good
[10:44:28] <kinblas> for finding perf problems
[10:44:54] <kinblas> toddmparker_: sorry was too lazy to calculate the percentage gains for each
[10:45:03] <kinblas> but it depends on what is on the page
[10:45:57] <toddmparker_> yeah
[10:46:00] <toddmparker_> i an do that
[10:46:14] <kinblas> toddmparker_: you get any real-world examples from that tweet yet?
[10:46:34] <toddmparker_> thinking it might just makes sense to compare enhancement time sing load and transition isn't much diffferent
[10:47:07] <toddmparker_> just that one i pasted earlier
[10:47:09] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I know I said this a couple of days ago
[10:47:15] <kinblas> but I'll switch gears to loading
[10:47:22] <toddmparker_> oh, ok
[10:47:29] <kinblas> I got distracted by the low hanging fruit I saw in checkbox/control-group
[10:48:08] <toddmparker_> guess it makes sense to at last do  a passs thu load and transition
[10:48:14] <toddmparker_> to find any obvious stuff
[10:50:05] <toddmparker_> hey - peopleare saying touch overflow isn't doing anyhting
[10:50:12] <toddmparker_> anyone have time to test that?
[10:50:25] <toddmparker_> maybe just flip it on locallyand browser around
[10:51:52] <toddmparker_> Wilto is gonna give it a test
[10:52:10] <Wilto> Yep—five minutes.
[10:54:31] <Wilto> Workin’ for me.
[10:57:49] <kinblas> toddmparker_: did you see this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3020
[10:57:50] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3020 on jquery-mobile, reported by agcolom (2h, 36m ago): Problem with page display with fixed header and footer in latest
[10:57:56] <kinblas> is that due to some of the overlay changes?
[10:58:22] <Wilto> This looks familiar to me.
[10:58:33] <Wilto> Oh, oh, yeah, this one.
[10:58:36] <Wilto> Workin’ on it.
[10:58:47] <toddmparker_> Wilto is fixing now
[10:58:51] <Wilto> It’s not—the content wasn’t actually getting a theming class in RC2, for some reason.
[10:58:54] <Wilto> It is now.
[10:58:59] <Wilto> Unrelated to the dialogs, though.
[11:00:01] <Wilto> Previously, just the page was getting .ui-body-[theme]—now it’s the content and the body, which doubles up the gradients and looks busted.
[11:01:02] <Wilto> So at least for the time being, I’m scratching that from the content.
[11:11:50] <Wilto> Hey garann: you have any time to dig into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3010 ?

[11:14:43] <garann> (she says without looking at the bug)
[11:14:58] <garann> i have plenty of time, maybe not the expertise, i should say :)
[11:15:09] <Wilto> The bug is entitled: “all jaqueries are broken how do fix?”
[11:15:37] <garann> haha oh ok piece of cake
[11:15:59] <garann> you just want me to test this pull request?
[11:16:01] <Wilto> It seems okay at a glance, but if you wouldn’t mind pulling those changes into your repo and giving ’em a test.
[11:16:04] <Wilto> Yes indeed.
[11:16:21] <garann> you got it
[11:17:04] <Wilto> Thank you, thank you.

[11:21:33] <toddmparker_> that was what I thought I might have heard
[11:21:54] <toddmparker_> so look, if this is considered risky to do now with little immediate benefit we can wait until 1.0
[11:22:16] <johnbender> gseguin: your pull includes some perf stuff though eh?
[11:22:16] <toddmparker_> looks like a solid change so pulling this in at 1.1 is fine
[11:22:28] <toddmparker_> i'll defer to you on the risk
[11:22:40] <johnbender> yah I want to wait if we can
[11:32:09] <toddmparker_> i'm ok with that
[11:32:18] <toddmparker_> so lets review that in a week
[11:34:17] <johnbender> Wilto: ^^
[11:34:49] <Wilto> Oh, sorry johnbender—my bad.

[12:06:01] <Wilto> I mean, I want to say yes, but is there a convention for the commit messages and such? I have never TDD’d.

[12:13:03] <johnbender> does that affect files that are downloaded by folks?
[12:13:32] <johnbender> I only ask because people will want the version number of the file if they download it
[12:13:33] <eddiemonge> it will for stable releases. it should make it easier to download as it makes the file names more consistent
[12:14:28] <johnbender> eddiemonge: so if someone downloaded 2 different versions the file names would be the same?
[12:14:36] <eddiemonge> im thinking now that maybe the actual zipped file could have the version number in the name but the unzipped, cdn-linkable wont
[12:16:24] <eddiemonge> i mean the files in the zipped file themselves could have the version number

[12:30:31] <toddmparker_> you mean in the blog?
[12:30:40] <Wilto> It sets it really, REALLY carefully, kinblas.
[12:30:41] <toddmparker_> speedy kinblas
[12:31:14] <Wilto> I feel a furious tweet comin’ on.
[12:32:26] <kinblas> so after the file is loaded and we try to switch to the new page it takes 500ms ... 339 of that is location.hash =

[12:33:37] <eddiemonge> kinblas: could the page switch and then update the hash after the page is done loading?
[12:34:52] <kinblas> eddiemonge: the page *IS* loaded *AND* enhanced at this point
[12:35:06] <Wilto> I don’t think we can do much about #3016 there. Such is, to my knowledge, just how .focus() goes in iOS.

[14:37:46] <toddmparker_> heh
[14:37:59] <toddmparker_> what's the signal to noise ration there?
[14:38:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: should be slower at the top I think because the issues are more relevant
[14:38:04] <toddmparker_> ratio
[14:38:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: 50 / 50 so far
[14:38:17] <johnbender> not bad
[14:38:20] <toddmparker_> not too bad
[14:38:48] <toddmparker_> great. good to pull in the good stuf and send the questionable stuff back to more work

[14:54:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Reclaiming another 200-300 msecs on the 400 listview item page for iPad and WP7.5. - jblas@adobe.com
[14:54:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile - jblas@adobe.com
[14:59:26] <kinblas> toddmparker_: that last checkin brings the 400listview item down to 1 sec of enhancement
[14:59:30] <kinblas> on iPad
[15:01:08] <toddmparker_> wowie
[15:01:16] <toddmparker_> what was it on RC2
[15:01:36] <kinblas> 3.7 seconds
[15:01:49] <toddmparker_> yeah, just looked it up. huge improvement
[15:03:14] <toddmparker_> so should I be saying it's 2.7 times faster, 70% faster, etc.
[15:03:25] <toddmparker_> what is the best way to present this
[15:03:31] <kinblas> lol
[15:03:39] <kinblas> not sure because it depends on what's on the page
[15:03:44] <kinblas> if the dominating thing on the page is lists
[15:03:44] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:04:02] <kinblas> listviews are 70% faster at enhancement
[15:04:13] <toddmparker_> guess if it's more than 50%, saying 2x is maybe more impactful?
[15:04:14] <Wilto> _Damn_, man.
[15:04:20] <toddmparker_> holy smokes
[15:04:33] <toddmparker_> i just want to lock you in a closet with a profiler for a month
[15:04:45] <kinblas> looking at the numbers
[15:04:50] <toddmparker_> he puts the profiler in the basket...
[15:04:51] <kinblas> it's more like 50-70%
[15:05:05] <toddmparker_> crazy
[15:05:17] <kinblas> so I was looking at the page load path way ... most of it is enhancement
[15:05:32] <kinblas> not very much time is spent in the changepage/loadpage code
[15:05:50] <kinblas> that IE (Mango) setting of location.hash has me a bit mystified
[15:06:10] <kinblas> I'll probably chase that down ... I wonder if it's firing off some sync hashchange or something
[15:06:25] <kinblas> it's 340msecs on the listview page
[15:06:32] <kinblas> but it's like 15ms on other pages
[15:06:39] <kinblas> so something strange is going on there
[15:09:17] * kinblas agrees with johnbenders WP7 tweet
[15:09:33] <kinblas> johnbender: it definitely feels more polished
[15:14:34] <johnbender> kinblas: I rather like the interface and transitions too
[15:14:46] <toddmparker_> it's interesting at least
[15:14:50] <toddmparker_> WP7.5
[15:14:53] <toddmparker_> right?
[15:15:03] <kinblas> yeah
[15:15:04] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I rather prefer it to android and ios actuallyu
[15:15:11] <johnbender> I like the square look and feel too
[15:15:21] <johnbender> everything rounded drives me nuts
[15:15:34] <kinblas> you're so square bender

[15:32:47] <toddmparker_> wilto just found an issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3028
[15:32:47] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3028 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (54.864s ago): Listviews aren't inheriting theme properly
[15:33:29] <kinblas> toddmparker_: that's been a problem right? Or is it new?
[15:34:28] <toddmparker_> think it's new kinblas
[15:34:34] <toddmparker_> i didn't see a ticket
[15:34:43] <kinblas> so it wasn't a problem in RC2?
[15:34:50] <toddmparker_> i gotta check that
[15:35:02] <Wilto> Got a bunch of test pages about to go up in the docs—I don’t know that we really had a representative case where we could’ve encountered it, before now.
[15:35:07] <toddmparker_> it's bad because everything else inherits
[15:35:21] <toddmparker_> should be an easy fix
[15:35:24] <kinblas> it's easy enough to fix
[15:35:38] <kinblas> I just wanted to make sure *I* didn't break it
[15:35:39] <kinblas> :-)
[15:37:15] <Wilto> DAMMIT KIN
[15:37:19] <Wilto> No, doesn’t work as well.
[15:37:23] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I don't think it's ever worked ?
[15:38:03] <kinblas> Wilto: I don't see any inherit searching codein listview
[15:38:24] <kinblas> it looks only at the list item theme or o.theme
[15:38:43] <kinblas> which is 'c'
[15:38:47] <Wilto> Eh, no worries—I’ll patch that up Monday.
[15:39:10] <toddmparker_> I just tested and this wasn't working in RC2:
[15:39:10] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/ehafik/5
[15:39:10] <toddmparker_> Or RC1:
[15:39:10] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/ehafik/8
[15:39:10] <toddmparker_> Or way back at B1:
[15:39:10] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/ehafik/9
[15:39:23] <Wilto> Ahem… DAMMIT SCOTT.
[15:39:29] <kinblas> toddmparker_: right, there's no inheritance code in listview
[15:39:35] <toddmparker_> kinblas: do you see any perf issues with fixing this?
[15:39:51] <kinblas> lol
[15:39:54] <kinblas> read my mind
[15:39:58] <kinblas> I was like ugh
[15:39:59] <Wilto> You never know, man!
[15:40:06] <toddmparker_> -=-=-=-=spooky=-=-=-=-
[15:40:09] <kinblas> actually I re-wrote the inheritance util
[15:40:11] <kinblas> it's fast
[15:40:33] <toddmparker_> guess i wonder if fixing this will break a lot of sites
[15:40:52] <kinblas> yeah I guess that's the big question
[15:41:04] <kinblas> but we've been telling folks that things inherit
[15:42:02] <toddmparker_> i know
[15:42:08] <Wilto> I was just saying: in a vacuum, it should absolutely inherit.
[15:42:10] <toddmparker_> it's the right thing to do
[15:42:18] <kinblas> toddmparker_: regarding the perf impact, folks generally don't have many listviews on their page
[15:42:21] <Wilto> And I’m thinking it should be fixed pre-1.0 if ever… But still.
[15:42:21] <kinblas> so it's not a big deal
[15:42:28] <toddmparker_> but if it's not a regression per se
[15:42:45] <kinblas> personally I want consistency
[15:42:48] <Wilto> “Transgression?”
[15:42:50] <toddmparker_> the inheritance is a one time lookup, right?
[15:42:54] <toddmparker_> me too
[15:43:06] <toddmparker_> so we fix it and mention it in the release notes
[15:43:18] <kinblas> toddmparker: actually that's a question I had
[15:43:28] <kinblas> we lookup theme on *EVERY* listview item
[15:43:30] <toddmparker_> we've done similiar thign with the form elements in rc2
[15:43:35] <kinblas> do folks really theme an item?
[15:43:39] <toddmparker_> wha?
[15:43:51] <Wilto> I hope the hell they aren’t.
[15:44:00] <toddmparker_> not for inheritance tho. they all have the same parent
[15:44:01] <Wilto> What is this; MySpace?
[15:44:06] * kinblas gets the line number
[15:44:10] <toddmparker_> you need to look for the data-theme on the li tho
[15:44:40] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.listview.js#L170
[15:44:49] <kinblas> it would be a mucho-perf-win if we could lose that
[15:45:01] <kinblas> pardon my spanish
[15:45:20] <Wilto> “Mucho perform-o,” I believe.
[15:45:30] <kinblas> toddmparker_: that's why I was asking ... do folks really do that?
[15:45:46] <toddmparker_> what, set a data-theme on a li?
[15:45:52] <kinblas> ya mon
[15:46:03] <toddmparker_> we do it in the docs for the on state
[15:46:12] <toddmparker_> because we're lame
[15:46:18] <kinblas> what?
[15:46:19] <toddmparker_> and refuse to use includes
[15:46:25] <kinblas> "on state"?
[15:46:28] <kinblas> you mean active?
[15:46:30] <toddmparker_> the leftnav is a list
[15:46:38] <toddmparker_> and we set data-theme="a" for the on state
[15:46:46] <kinblas> why didn't you guys just put active on it?
[15:46:47] <toddmparker_> well, we decided to use a
[15:47:02] <Wilto> ( kinblas: Study https://twitter.com/ElBloombito well. )
[15:47:03] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from ElBloombito: Feliz Unounounounounounovidad! ★ http://bit.ly/uzgkpT
[15:47:08] <toddmparker_> we're just as irrational as the next dev, c'mon
[15:47:16] <Wilto> Who knows why I do things.
[15:47:43] <toddmparker_> active is sort of odd
[15:47:50] <toddmparker_> i don't know how i'd set that
[15:48:02] <toddmparker_> just add the class to the li?
[15:48:26] <kinblas> well it's like old-school menus ... just put a class on the one that represents the current page
[15:48:27] <toddmparker_> the hover would probably swap to the other list item hover state
[15:48:43] <kinblas> toddmparker_: but not if you put your own selected class on it
[15:48:44] <toddmparker_> yeah, we're old skool
[15:48:51] <toddmparker_> if we did it, others will
[15:49:00] <kinblas> anyways, just so you know the *FEWER* jqmData calls we can make in that loop
[15:49:16] <kinblas> the more we save ... think of it this way ... jqmData() calls are about 1msec on some platforms
[15:49:23] <kinblas> one less saves 400ms
[15:49:31] <kinblas> on the 400 item listview
[15:49:40] <toddmparker_> lists are already TOO FAST
[15:49:51] <toddmparker_> we need to slow 'em down with some features and stuff
[15:49:58] <Wilto> toddmparker_ is afraid we’ll frighten users with our blinding speed.
[15:50:00] <kinblas> oh, but we can get it under  a second
[15:50:06] <kinblas> :-P
[15:50:11] <toddmparker_> bor-ing

[15:50:25] <Wilto> Or break the speed of light and end up with outdated code before we even write it.
