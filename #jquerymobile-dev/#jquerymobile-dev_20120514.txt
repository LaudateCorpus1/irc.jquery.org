[08:14:37] <johnbender> gseguin: ping
[08:15:11] <gseguin> ping: cannot resolve gseguin: Unknown host
[08:15:47] <gseguin> what's up johnbender
[08:17:45] <johnbender> gseguin: lol
[08:18:00] <johnbender> gseguin: I've got as much of the grunt build finished as I'm going to do for now
[08:18:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I guess I was wondering if you wanted to take a look before I merge into master
[08:18:50] <johnbender> gseguin: I can force push to our grunt branch at jquery/jquery-mobile
[08:19:03] <johnbender> or you can check it out on my personal fork
[08:19:48] <gseguin> johnbender: I don't know if I'll have time to get to it
[08:19:52] <gseguin> today
[08:19:55] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[08:19:58] <gseguin> but I'll try
[08:20:00] <johnbender> gseguin: no worries
[08:20:14] <johnbender> I'll let you know when I merge it since it could be a server support issue too
[09:16:40] <uGoMobi> johnbender: are you there?
[09:59:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yes
[09:59:57] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: gseguin: _|Nix|_: I'm going to merge the grunt build work into master here shortly
[10:00:00] <johnbender> so if you're doing builds locally things will change
[10:00:57] <uGoMobi> johnbender: did you see my ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4348
[10:00:59] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4348 on jquery-mobile (uGoMobi; 19h, 17m ago): Latest incompatible with jQuery 1.6.4
[10:06:55] <uGoMobi> johnbender: since recommended JSBin issue template doesn't work anymore I thought it's better to fix it soon
[10:08:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hmm
[10:08:19] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'll patch that right quick
[10:08:31] <johnbender> the bigger problem is, why didn't the build break :(
[10:08:33] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok cool!
[10:09:22] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper, I'll get back to you soon regarding the wording for the doc.
[10:09:23] <uGoMobi> johnbender: don't ask me... :|
[10:09:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne, ok thanks
[10:10:23] <agcolom> uGoMobi:  by soon i mean this evening ;-) I'm cooking now... Steak and ale pie!
[10:10:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it's copy and paste work mostly because I don't think it's good idea when the docs are written in all kind of different styles
[10:10:54] <agcolom> absolutely
[10:11:29] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sounds like a good dinner... watch out your steaks dont burn
[10:11:33] <johnbender> uGoMobi: pushed
[10:11:45] <uGoMobi> johnbender: great, thanks!
[10:11:55] <uGoMobi> johnbender: i'll close the issue

[10:12:00] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] 1.6.4 compatability using bind - John Bender
[10:12:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ah, thanks
[10:12:59] <agcolom> uGoMobi should be ok, it is cooking slowly in ale (beer).. really nice...
[10:13:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: stop it, not fair!
[10:15:24] <uGoMobi> johnbender: in jQuery 1.7.1 .live() is not only superseded but also depreciated right?
[10:15:29] <agcolom> toddparker: are you here?
[10:18:08] <uGoMobi> agcolom: on the docs page about events we use .live() in the code examples
[10:20:12] <agcolom> ok
[10:20:16] <agcolom> yes
[10:20:40] <uGoMobi> Does the word superseded by definition mean that the former version has been depreciated?
[10:21:12] <agcolom> not sure
[10:21:12] <uGoMobi> or could it been they excist next to eachother?
[10:21:56] <agcolom> I thought live was replaced by bind?
[10:21:59] <uGoMobi> difficult for the docs... with 1.6.4 you should use .live() not .on()  and in 1.7.1 it's the other way around
[10:22:09] <uGoMobi> no
[10:23:02] <agcolom> Should make that clear then in the docs then
[10:25:15] <uGoMobi> live: Attach an event handler for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future.
[10:25:29] <uGoMobi> that now and in the future part makes it different from bind
[10:26:40] <agcolom> yep, sorry just checked. I meant the other way round
[10:27:34] <agcolom> or is it best to keep them completely separate as in you know you will not add such elements in the future and only bind is needed?
[10:28:02] <agcolom> or do we go for live in general?
[10:29:11] <uGoMobi> we should use .on()
[10:29:35] <uGoMobi> .on() is the preferred method and replaces bind live and delegate
[10:30:01] <agcolom> ok... so that's with jquery 1.7.1?
[10:30:05] <uGoMobi> yes
[10:30:27] <uGoMobi> in 1.6.4. there is no .on()
[10:30:49] <uGoMobi> so thats difficult for the docs since both jquery versions are supported
[10:31:08] <agcolom> ok. thx for the clarification
[10:31:19] <uGoMobi> your welcome
[10:55:39] <agcolom> BTW, I won't be able to do any JQM work tomorrow evening... I'm going to the Mozilla open house in London....
[10:56:09] <agcolom> Any message we would like to put forward to Mozilla FF?
[11:10:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I think so yes
[11:10:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: at some point we'll have to address all that and drop 1.6.4 support
[11:10:56] <johnbender> but I'm holding out
[11:11:42] <agcolom> johnbender: sorry it's out of context but your poster is looking amazing!
[11:11:53] <johnbender> agcolom: thanks! hopefully the content is worthy of acceptance
[11:12:25] <uGoMobi> johnbender: i looked it up and it says depreciated and yes we can't keep supporting both
[11:12:26] <johnbender> agcolom: I'm in the process of putting my portfolio together for grad applications in Decemeber so this "research" is kind of the center piece
[11:13:11] <agcolom> it's really good, very informative! I wonder how many lives you've had to learn all this stuff (content as well as product)
[11:15:06] <agcolom> and it's very well written! "chapeau bas" as we say in French! (maybe gseguin can translate ;-) )
[11:15:29] <johnbender> agcolom: I love to learn - I'm something of an addict
[11:15:30] <gseguin> tip of the hat
[11:15:50] <johnbender> agcolom: thanks for your kind words btw, the encouragement is appreciated
[11:16:16] <agcolom> well deserved. Happy to review the final version or any version...
[11:17:04] <johnbender> agcolom: cool I will keep that in mind!
[11:17:42] <johnbender> alright
[11:18:01] <johnbender> toddparker: gseguin: Wilto: if there are no objections I'm going to merge the grunt build stuff into master
[11:18:27] <johnbender> hopefull it completely destroy the build on master :D
[11:18:32] <johnbender> *hopefully
[11:18:32] <uGoMobi> johnbender: oh no wait let me pull upstream first ;-)
[11:18:39] <gseguin> no objection here
[11:18:59] <johnbender> gseguin: we should chat about it at some point just so you're aware of all the ... ugly ... spts
[11:19:23] <gseguin> would wed work ?
[11:20:56] <johnbender> and the monkey flips the switch

[12:35:49] <agcolom> johnbender, gseguin, any strong feeling about using 'ID'  or 'id' in the docs to refer to id attribute for jqm and/or html element id? (the consistency police is on patrol ;) )
[12:55:56] <johnbender> deAtog: hrm
[12:56:04] <Wilto> johnbender: NOOOOyeah it’s cool.
[12:56:28] <johnbender> agcolom: consistency is cool
[12:56:35] <johnbender> lower case fits with the markup better

[13:10:38] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by ahormann (2m, 3w ago): conform to strict mode
[13:10:55] <johnbender> is there any reason we shouldn't switch that `this` to window
[13:10:56] <deAtog> johnbender: looking over grunt's docs it seems that grunt.config.get( 'global' ) is returning {"output":"compiled","name":"jquery.mobile"} as defined in grunt.js rather than what is defined in build/tasks/config.js
[13:12:26] <johnbender> deAtog: hmm
[13:12:32] <johnbender> make by itself works fine locally
[13:12:47] <johnbender> deAtog: but that should be clarified either way
[13:12:49] <johnbender> err
[13:12:52] <johnbender> unified
[13:14:36] <johnbender> deAtog: if you take the global: {} out of the grunt.js do you get a different result?
[13:16:04] <deAtog> yeah.. tells me it can't read dirs property of undefined
[13:16:31] <deAtog> in other words.. grunt.config.get( 'global' ) returns undefined
[13:17:00] <johnbender> deAtog: it could be the load order
[13:17:02] <johnbender> one sec
[13:17:10] <gseguin> johnbender: no reason that I see for us, but in absolute 'this' is the global object no matter where you're running
[13:17:44] <gseguin> window is not in a node env (at least I don't think it is)
[13:18:10] <gseguin> not that you can use our modules in node
[13:18:18] <johnbender> gseguin: that's why I asked!
[13:18:23] <johnbender> I figured there was a reason for it
[13:18:34] <johnbender> I'll close that pr then
[13:19:24] <gseguin> johnbender: it did catch an undeclared var
[13:19:42] <gseguin> in js/jquery.mobile.support.js
[13:20:12] <gseguin> or did it?
[13:20:35] <johnbender> yah
[13:20:40] <johnbender> in theory the linting should catch that
[13:21:28] <gseguin> yup
[13:22:03] <gseguin> also check with the core code that they use (function() {...}( jQuery, this ))
[13:22:22] <gseguin> but I'm pretty sure they are
[13:24:49] <agcolom> quick one: currently, it seems that it is not possible to style read-only lists using data-theme. Is this something that we should look at? or are we happy the way it is?
[13:26:26] <uGoMobi> agcolom: i dont think thats the case
[13:26:47] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you can style them with data-theme
[13:27:27] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but they are style like ui-body-a
[13:27:42] <uGoMobi> and not like ui-btn-up-a
[13:27:57] <uGoMobi> because you cant click them

[13:28:43] <johnbender> just above the loadTasks call in grunt.js
[13:28:58] <johnbender> I'm wondering if that's the issue
[13:29:09] <agcolom> uGoMobi, yes, but what if you want you li to stand out on your background (and not have the content theme)
[13:29:40] <gseguin> johnbender, deAtog: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4356
[13:29:40] <uGoMobi> then you could use another swatch

[13:30:16] <agcolom> a workaround is to use the divider, but it'd be nice to set a theme to all the ul at once...
[13:30:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: when you style read-only as button you give the user the impression he/she can click on it

[13:44:03] <johnbender> deAtog: replace the `loadTasks` with require( path.resolve(path.join('build', 'tasks', 'config', 'config')) )( grunt );
[13:44:20] <johnbender> I'd rather explicityly load the config and leave it in the same dir

[13:44:47] <johnbender> just making sure that works since I can't seem to test it
[13:44:49] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: often, when we navigate to a page with popups the popups are like normal divs
[13:46:14] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: you reload and all is fine. I think sometimes pages need a 'reload' to appear properly... at the beginning this behavior was rare, now it's more frequent. Not sure if it is related to popups or a mistake in the code...
[13:47:21] <_|Nix|_> Weird ... if the "pagecreate" event is not fired, then popups will not be enhanced, and they will appear as normal divs.
[13:47:29] <deAtog> johnbender: yeah that works
[13:47:29] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ^
[13:47:47] <johnbender> deAtog: nice
[13:47:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's all I can think of ...
[13:47:50] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: I'm thinking this may be a more general JQM issue, as the other pb in this case is some of the CSS is not applied... However, it doesn't happen on pages without popups... maybe it is a coincidence
[13:48:30] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah ... missing css - that's another reason why popups would not be rendered correctly.
[13:48:42] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: But that should not be fixable via reload ...
[13:48:55] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: On what devices are you seeing this?
[13:49:02] <agcolom> _|Nix|_:  would a quick fix be to force a call to pagecreate?

[13:59:08] <agcolom> gseguin: thank you :-)
[13:59:27] <gseguin> agcolom: that was one of your question, right?
[14:00:01] <gseguin> context switching sometimes leads to awkward comments/answers
[14:00:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, so I dont use <code> then in this case
[14:01:07] <agcolom> I would say use code for it as we are talking about the id attribute of all html tags
[14:06:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok I think I finally get it :) thanks!
[14:06:40] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: I think popups are not at fault as only certain conditions cause the problem.... I'm sure it's mistake in the code...
[14:11:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you feel like closing a (non) issue?
[14:12:46] <ajpiano> toddparker: you there?
[14:14:38] <gseguin> jrburke: ping
[14:14:51] <jrburke> gseguin: hi
[14:15:00] <gseguin> hey
[14:15:14] <gseguin> I'm not sure you got a notification from github re https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/5b8f2be9d22131a3eceeb20d012402c1aba6121c#commitcomment-1320266
[14:15:15] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (4m, 1d ago): Added wrapper to export as an AMD modules removed jquery.mobile.exports
[14:15:20] <agcolom>  uGoMobi, yes

[14:15:28] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4349 on jquery-mobile (udaykadaboina; 19h, 23m ago): page transitions not working in IE9, firefox12 & android 2.3.5
[14:15:32] <gseguin> would you mind weighing in?
[14:16:25] <jrburke> gseguin: huh, odd i do not believe i got that notice. looking now...
[14:17:08] <gseguin> thank you
[14:18:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you can technically force it to use a slide in Android by setting the fallback
[14:18:29] <uGoMobi> johnbender: huh ??

[14:18:48] <johnbender> ^
[14:19:10] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah, sorry, I was just surprised
[14:19:13] <johnbender> $.mobile.transitionFallbacks.slide = "slide";
[14:20:42] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, that is not what I understood from the docs http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[14:23:43] <uGoMobi> It does not make sence to set the fallback for a transition type that doesn't look good to a transition that also doesn't look good
[14:24:37] <uGoMobi> but I understand that it doesn't mean that it is technically not possible
[14:28:58] <jrburke> gseguin: commented, thanks for the extra ping.
[14:29:18] <gseguin> thank you jrburke
[14:29:38] <uGoMobi> johnbender: so it's more 'override' than 'fallback'
[14:31:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: no it's meant to be a fallback, I'm just using that as my "override
[14:31:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: the "override" would be to force the 3d check value to be true, but I think that's timing senstive
[14:32:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, I understand. Is this information that we want to have in the docs or should it remain secret? :)
[14:42:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah I'd leave it out of there for now
[14:42:14] <johnbender> uGoMobi: but it's fine to post in the issue
[14:42:26] <johnbender> if we get lots of requests we can provide a mechanism for setting it
[14:42:27] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Problem fixed. wasn't a popup issue. Sorry for the false alarm
[14:42:30] <johnbender> or add it to the docs
[14:42:49] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah I will update my comment
