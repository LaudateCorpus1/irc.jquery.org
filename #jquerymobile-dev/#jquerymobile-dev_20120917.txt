[05:27:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: are you around?
[07:05:59] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: good call on tapToggleBlacklist for popup - mind adding that?
[07:05:59] <bot-t> (4 hours 48 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell toddmparker_: shall we add class ui-popup to the fixed toolbars tapToggleBlacklist
[07:06:31] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes, will commit the change
[07:06:37] <toddmparker_> thanks
[07:06:44] <toddmparker_> man, you were a triage machine this weekend
[07:07:05] <uGoMobi> yeah, it was needed badly
[07:07:12] <toddmparker_> i think it's official: you are the triage team lead
[07:07:33] <toddmparker_> really appreciate it
[07:07:59] <uGoMobi> thanks
[07:09:20] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: can you and Wilto look at the fix I suggested here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5008#issuecomment-8593896 ?
[07:10:13] <uGoMobi> actually that is the same "clearfix" solution as what I used for controlgroups
[07:10:15] <Wilto> NO
[07:10:49] <toddmparker_> man, that is broken in chrome desktop too
[07:11:00] <toddmparker_> clearfix seems ok to me...wilto?
[07:11:22] <uGoMobi> Wilto: good morning to you too... had your coffee already? ;)
[07:11:53] <toddmparker_> i wouldn't mind landing that today
[07:11:57] <Wilto> Just waitin’ on them chemicals to kick in.
[07:12:06] <toddmparker_> we should wrap changes tho...RC now
[07:12:06] <uGoMobi> in controlgroups we can't use overflow hidden either to give it height because of select buttons if I remember well
[07:12:17] <toddmparker_> rather go final later this week
[07:12:18] <Wilto> Yeah, this checks out okay by me, at a glance.
[07:13:46] <uGoMobi> I can commit it to master now

[07:25:47] <toddmparker_> just came in
[07:27:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: that was actually the next issue I wanted to look into
[07:27:49] <uGoMobi> hope I just fixed it :)
[07:31:47] <uGoMobi> oh yeah!! it fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4958 as well :D
[07:33:31] <Wilto> Sweet.
[07:47:24] <toddmparker_> cool
[07:48:29] <toddmparker_> two birds, one commit
[08:56:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did we run into some issues over the weekend :(

[09:35:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/testswarm] introduce timeout to verify this isn't a timing issue - John Bender
[09:48:24] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! When we switched to jQ 1.8, we lost our ability to handle starting URLs that are of the form http://domain/path/to/page.html#&ui-state=dialog
[09:49:01] <_|Nix|_> For some reason when we open a dialog from such a URL and we go back, we don't get a hashchange anymore.
[09:49:39] <_|Nix|_> ... even though the has is supposed to be different, because when you open a dialog from such a page, the hash becomes #/path/to/dialog.html&ui-state=dialog
[09:50:17] <_|Nix|_> I noticed this while fixing 4994.
[09:50:58] <_|Nix|_> http://domain/path/to/page1.html#/path/to/page2.html&ui-state=dialog and http://domain/path/to/page1.html#/path/to/page1.html&ui-state=dialog are both still fine.
[09:54:43] <_|Nix|_> What happens is that, if you open a dialog off such a URL, when you close it (i.e., when you go back), the history changes, but nothing happens in the page, because we don't get the hashchange anymore.
[09:54:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hi! sounds like that also causes this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4943
[09:55:20] <johnbender> ...
[09:55:23] <johnbender> whoa
[09:55:24] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that might be the case.
[09:55:49] <_|Nix|_> Switching to 1.8.x brought all kindsa trouble.
[09:55:54] <johnbender> :(
[09:56:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: can we just release without support for 1.8
[09:56:41] <johnbender> at this point it's hard to know if there are more ugly issues burried in the library that only show up for 1.8
[09:57:02] <johnbender> I guess that seems crazy
[09:57:04] <johnbender> :/
[09:57:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I wish I had had some unit tests for all those nav corner cases I have fixed. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to set up a test for initial URLs.
[09:57:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: redirects?
[09:58:01] <johnbender> we do that for nav reset
[09:58:03] <johnbender> err
[09:58:10] <johnbender> disabled push state
[09:58:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I figured there might be something like that already in place, but I haven't had the time to study it.
[09:58:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: k
[09:59:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What I need would be, like, go to another Web site, wiping everything associated with the current page. The other website is the actual test and its URL ends in #&ui-state=dialog ...
[10:00:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah you need a test per page
[10:00:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was thinking about some cookie based hairy scheme, but I'm sure there are more elegany ways.
[10:00:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the only reason to use the redirect is so it get's picked up by the testing glob
[10:00:28] <johnbender> s/get's/gets/
[10:01:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: When you say "redirect" you're talking about how we run the same set of tests once with pushState on and the second time via a redirect without pushState on, right?
[10:01:50] <johnbender>  /initial-dialog-hash-redirect-tests.html => /initial-dialog-hash-test.html#&ui-state=dialog
[10:01:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right
[10:02:42] <johnbender> it's not pretty but it's something
[10:02:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What about when I want to test whether a mistake in jQM throws us outside the jQM-managed history?
[10:03:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't know what you mean
[10:03:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah
[10:03:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't think we can test that
[10:03:33] <johnbender> because it would push us off the test page
[10:03:46] <johnbender> but you can certainly test that history works correctly for an initial dialog hash state
[10:03:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, that's what I thought.
[10:04:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, I've seen the problem where you go back, but the page displayed stays the same.
[10:04:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That doesn't require going off the test page.
[10:05:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, the root cause for that was not the lack of a hashchange signal.
[10:05:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: This time, however, it is. And that's more serious.
[10:11:27] <toddmparker_> catching back up, sorry a meeting popped up
[10:11:38] <toddmparker_> so yikes
[10:12:11] <toddmparker_> johnbender and _|Nix|_ - did you guys huddle with DaveMethvin to track down what changed and why in core
[10:13:17] <DaveMethvin> headsup guys, we're planning to put out 1.8.2 late this week ... so let me know if we need to change anything asap
[10:16:13] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Whew ... OK ... I'll try to find out why we're not getting a hashchange ... I'll do a bisect in core ...

[10:21:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/testswarm] debug - John Bender
[10:33:30] <toddmparker_> DaveMethvin: turn out there is a hashchange issue we'd like to look at
[10:34:28] <DaveMethvin> were you able to narrow down a change that caused it toddmparker_
[10:35:32] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Not yet.
[10:35:39] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: But it's in work.
[10:36:09] <toddmparker_> johnbender: you around?
[10:36:14] <DaveMethvin> where would we be without git-bisect?
[10:36:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I am indeed
[10:36:26] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Doing it by hand.
[10:37:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: struggling mightily to figure out why these tests fail in the testswarm run but otherwise pass in browserstack :(
[10:43:28] <toddmparker_> odd
[10:43:33] <toddmparker_> this for the haschange stuff?
[10:43:50] <toddmparker_> so _|Nix|_
[10:43:58] <toddmparker_> can I repor this issue in the docs?
[10:44:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Not yet sure what's causing it.
[10:46:58] <toddmparker_> i know, what is this something I can see in the docs somewhere?
[10:47:16] <toddmparker_> btw - just got a new kindle fire and it's garbage
[10:47:32] <toddmparker_> hashchange seems wonky - popups won't close
[10:47:47] <toddmparker_> fixed positioning is crazy jittery
[10:47:51] <toddmparker_> ugh
[10:48:01] <agcolom> hi :-)
[10:49:13] <toddmparker_> hi agcolom - are you back from travels? how did it go?
[10:51:08] <agcolom> well, as good as could go really.... but funerals are really sad!
[10:52:13] <agcolom> So RC1 went out...
[10:53:42] <agcolom> Did you decide on the logo?
[10:59:51] <agcolom> toddmparker_: ^
[11:02:29] <toddmparker_> sorry agcolom - yep, RC1 went out on friday
[11:02:51] <toddmparker_> some issues have cropped up with 1.8 we're looking at now
[11:03:12] <toddmparker_> on the logo, i think we're 99% going with the 12.5 (flat) version
[11:03:21] <toddmparker_> works for the most people
[11:03:57] <agcolom> yes, I like it as well.
[11:04:13] <agcolom> Looks neat and clean... and recognizable...
[11:04:19] <toddmparker_> thanks
[11:04:33] <toddmparker_> i'm just happy to have something we can own
[11:04:33] <agcolom> will look great on t-shirts ;-)
[11:04:37] <toddmparker_> yep
[11:04:50] <toddmparker_> now i want to re-do the docs ia and design
[11:05:07] <agcolom> yep :-)
[11:05:21] <agcolom> although I like the "old" docs...
[11:05:34] <agcolom> It 's a nice way to feature JQM
[11:06:15] <agcolom> BTW I am thinking of submitting a talk for jQuery UK
[11:07:18] <agcolom> How jQuery Mobile supports good mobile UI principles (still looking for a catchy title!)
[11:08:08] <agcolom> Then I'd get to show all the good stuff JQM provides :-)

[11:14:29] <agcolom> oh yes!!!!
[11:14:32] <johnbender> although it's still not an issues template
[11:14:37] <johnbender> which would have been much better
[11:14:42] <Wilto> Hey, I’ll take it, for now.
[11:14:48] <agcolom> johnbender: you're a top super top super star!!!!
[11:14:50] <uGoMobi> johnbender: how nice

[11:28:54] <toddmparker_> that is a great idea
[11:29:32] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_ or johnbender - what's the story with that haschange bizness
[11:31:54] <uGoMobi> I think our contributing.md should contain only one line... "Are you really sure you want to do this?" :D
[11:40:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ?
[11:40:25] <johnbender> I can help now that I'm waiting to hear back from browserstack
[11:46:19] <toddmparker_> johnbender: please do
[11:46:33] <toddmparker_> just want to get my arms around what's happening and what our options are
[11:46:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm not quite clear on it either
[11:46:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can you walk me through what's happening?
[11:47:39] <uGoMobi> johnbender: There are a couple of open issues about unit tests on IE/WP (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=Unit+test&page=1&state=open). Let me know when you are done with fixing the tests for IE so I can ask people to test again.
[11:47:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I will
[11:47:58] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I've probably gotten most of those
[11:48:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: if you want to pull the testswarm branch
[11:48:09] <johnbender> you can try them out too
[11:48:18] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok great
[11:48:24] <uGoMobi> will do
[11:48:25] <johnbender> uGoMobi: checking those out now though
[11:48:55] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:51:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm stepping out in a half hour for a meeting with a professor
[11:51:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: when I get back I'll dive into the hashchange problem if _|Nix|_ hasn't solved it by then
[11:57:24] <agcolom> toddmparker_: I have kids school meetings the next 2 thursdays! So will be missing our next 2 meetings.
[11:59:27] <toddmparker_> ok agcolom

[12:09:34] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: https://github.com/robschmuecker seems like someone who likes to help
[12:30:25] <agcolom> uGoMobi: are there any known issues with JQM in iframes with FF?
[12:31:04] <agcolom> (only if you can think of something, don't search !)
[12:31:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: not that I recall
[12:31:19] <agcolom> ok, thanks...
[12:31:26] <uGoMobi> already did the search ;)
[12:31:50] <agcolom> I just didn't want you to spend time on this ;-)
[12:32:28] <uGoMobi> it's ok
[12:32:59] <uGoMobi> nothing with FF in the title popped up when searching for iframe
[12:35:41] <agcolom> it's strange, I need to catch Scott G... I think it's the latest version of something in the API docs that means some demos don't show up in FF but all ok in Safari.... and the iframes I add myself are all ok....
[12:38:03] <toddmparker_> that's odd
[12:39:52] <agcolom> yes, I need to look into it....
[12:40:02] <agcolom> I've updated to FF15... same thing!
[12:40:28] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Could you have a look at this: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible/
[12:42:03] <agcolom> can you see the final demo in FF?
[13:03:27] <toddmparker_> agcolom: what FF version? Any?
[13:03:57] <toddmparker_> agcolom and uGoMobi - been thinking about how to re-do the docs
[13:03:58] <toddmparker_> http://i.imgur.com/BE4Mb.png

[13:09:35] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: got a Boston accent too? ;)
[13:09:48] <toddmparker_> nice ryanneufeld
[13:09:53] <ryanneufeld> No, I'm from canadia
[13:09:53] <toddmparker_> thanks uGoMobi
[13:10:12] <toddmparker_> needs more work but i'd like to have a design and even templates ready for DC
[13:10:24] <toddmparker_> so people can load these in and we can flip the docs
[13:10:34] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking forward to that
[13:11:02] <ryanneufeld> interesting change to the logo
[13:11:21] <ryanneufeld> I like it
[13:11:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: do you want mobile and desktop layout only or also tablet
[13:11:40] <ryanneufeld> clearly represents the multi device nature of jqm :)
[13:12:18] <toddmparker_> the logo?
[13:12:27] <ryanneufeld> yes
[13:12:28] <toddmparker_> clearly
[13:12:47] <ryanneufeld> That was first time I saw it, and it made sense right away
[13:13:15] <ryanneufeld> and it's simple enough you could almost do it pure css styles
[13:14:01] <toddmparker_> ryanneufeld: yeah? cool to hear actually
[13:14:17] <toddmparker_> a race to see who can do it in css first
[13:14:21] <uGoMobi> can make it animate
[13:14:25] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: no
[13:14:26] <uGoMobi> :D
[13:14:28] <ryanneufeld> just no
[13:14:31] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:14:34] <toddmparker_> fixed up the header on desktop to emphasize the version
[13:14:35] <toddmparker_> http://i.imgur.com/xkOCo.png
[13:14:41] <uGoMobi> I just say it is possible
[13:14:53] <toddmparker_> animate it. always makes things better
[13:15:00] <agcolom> toddmparker_: I tried FF14 and FF15
[13:15:12] <toddmparker_> a build would be cool where those converged in
[13:15:13] <agcolom> toddmparker_: That looks v nice!!!!
[13:15:20] <toddmparker_> thanks agcolom!
[13:15:21] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: while we're at it, we could make the cursor turn into a crow when ever you mouse over a link
[13:15:39] <uGoMobi> yup that is possible
[13:15:40] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: and have a bouncing ball follow your mouse around!
[13:15:47] <toddmparker_> johnbender, gseguin, mauriceG - see that link above for some sketches for the new docs
[13:15:50] * ryanneufeld nods aprovingly
[13:16:06] <toddmparker_> DHTML FTW
[13:16:32] <agcolom> oh yes!!!!!
[13:16:57] <agcolom> toddmparker_: so would we use the XML in the api docs and XSLT ?
[13:16:59] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: we have to think about a good solution for the search tool
[13:18:29] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: I'd love to have a real search in there
[13:18:30] <agcolom> or all from scratch?
[13:18:53] <toddmparker_> agcolom: any of the api stuff should be pulled in from your API docs
[13:18:59] <toddmparker_> via XSLT of whatever
[13:19:07] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes me too
[13:19:22] <toddmparker_> so this would mostly be demos with a nice view of the API
[13:19:24] <agcolom> and the logo really works there!
[13:19:48] <toddmparker_> this is more to get us thinking about making big changes
[13:19:56] <toddmparker_> ideas welcome. let's tear it down
[13:20:39] <agcolom> and I like the blue horizontal gradient on the highlighted menu items
[13:21:03] <uGoMobi> yeah the colors are great
[13:21:39] <agcolom> how would this work on a small screen? would the menu popup?
[13:22:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: example is at the right side
[13:22:19] <agcolom> I'd add code highlighting with nice colors.
[13:22:37] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, but how does one get the menu up?
[13:22:50] <uGoMobi> the menu icon
[13:23:14] <uGoMobi> at left side of the logo
[13:23:18] <agcolom> oh, yes, sorry ;-)
[13:23:27] <uGoMobi> np :)
[13:23:43] <agcolom> but how does one get to the 1st menu?
[13:23:59] <agcolom> using the home in 2nd menu?
[13:25:44] <uGoMobi> something to think about but i think in this example the idea is that on the homepage the menu will show the different sections yes
[13:25:55] <agcolom> I am just thinking about the guys who translate the current docs into other languages... They'll have a shock when this comes out!
[13:26:00] <uGoMobi> if you are in a section the menu shows the subpages
[13:27:10] <agcolom> Could we merge the 2 menus?
[13:27:29] <uGoMobi> yeah probably
[13:27:34] <agcolom> (just some random thoughts)
[13:27:35] <uGoMobi> maybe make it an accordion
[13:27:49] <uGoMobi> so all the sections are in the menu as well
[13:27:58] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, that's what I was thinking....
[13:28:29] <agcolom> It seems that that's taking a lot of horizontal space... but then on a big screen maybe that doesn;t matter?
[13:28:34] <uGoMobi> I think that should be possible with CSS with same markup
[13:29:24] <uGoMobi> i think horizontal size doesn't really matter as long as you can scroll
[13:30:32] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes maybe that doesn't matter... Looking at my screen now... there is a lot of space actually....
[13:32:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: how do you want to get this started?
[13:35:40] <agcolom> toddmparker_: uGoMobi: the good think is I am getting all the examples that we have currently in the api docs (each as a separate file), so we should be able to reuse that as well
[13:36:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok cool
[13:38:46] <agcolom> So I'll be concentrating on getting as much of the api docs done for mid oct... Students have come back this week.... will be busy with work but should be able to do a bit every evening...
[13:38:50] <toddmparker_> sorry, wandered away
[13:38:59] <toddmparker_> menu opens with that icon
[13:39:01] <uGoMobi> the template of the new jQuery website also looks nice
[13:39:08] <uGoMobi> love those colors http://stage.jquery.org/about/
[13:39:40] <toddmparker_> thinking we'd show the level you're in (widgets) and the link at the top would either nav you up or we could change it to just slide the top level menu in
[13:39:47] <uGoMobi> and our green too of course :)
[13:40:08] <toddmparker_> now that i simplified the top level nav, maybe a collapsible would be fine
[13:40:29] <toddmparker_> tricky part is the lowest level nav
[13:40:50] <toddmparker_> switching between all the demos and the docs for a widget is tricky
[13:40:55] <toddmparker_> see: listview
[13:41:30] <agcolom> yes.... some widgets have lots of demos...
[13:41:36] <toddmparker_> i agree with agcolom - getting as much into the new API format is critical because it will be at least 60% of the content
[13:41:57] <toddmparker_> also writing the conversion from XML into our html format
[13:42:07] <toddmparker_> i'd like to look at a search too
[13:42:44] <toddmparker_> we can always do the crappy fake search we have now and just expand how many entries we have if we can't have a real search
[13:43:14] <toddmparker_> and add the feature to start a listview hidden - uGoMobi that might be a smaller thing to work on adding
[13:43:26] <toddmparker_> anyone have ideas on how to add a search?
[13:43:41] <agcolom> toddmparker_: how does the ui search work?
[13:43:50] <uGoMobi> yes I am going to make that for 1.3 anyway
[13:43:56] <toddmparker_> where?
[13:44:07] <agcolom> http://stage.jqueryui.com/
[13:44:35] <agcolom> search accordion
[13:44:50] <agcolom> you get the widget and other things as well...
[13:45:36] <agcolom> toddmparker_: actually I like the way you can navigate examples there...
[13:45:48] <agcolom> maybe we could do something similar?
[13:46:50] <toddmparker_> agcolom: ah, not sure. i'll have to ask
[13:47:37] <agcolom> toddmparker_: have you seen how you can navigate examples ?
[13:47:56] <agcolom> http://stage.jqueryui.com/accordion/#custom-icons
[13:48:07] <toddmparker_> agcolom: yeah, we could do something similar on larger screens
[13:48:23] <toddmparker_> on mobile, maybe the leftnav would be come a dropdown on top
[13:48:53] <agcolom> toddmparker_: yes, that avoids scrolling (imagine having all the demos one after teh other!)
[13:49:10] <agcolom> toddmparker_: yes, I agree
[13:49:25] <toddmparker_> be nice to make bigger changes
[13:50:52] <toddmparker_> wondering if we should have this all live within the site like ui
[13:50:55] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[13:51:20] <toddmparker_> it adds a lot of nav overhead but maybe it's better?
[13:51:49] <uGoMobi> what do you mean by "this all"?
[13:51:53] <toddmparker_> the big issue is this wouldn't be as pure jqm as the docs today if we had all the site css and js in play
[13:51:56] <agcolom> It would make it consistent I suppose... UI is going live v soon
[13:52:16] <toddmparker_> our demos are a separate thing. on ui, they are just a section of the site
[13:52:21] <agcolom> toddmparker_: yes, that's why I like the current docs
[13:52:41] <toddmparker_> me too
[13:52:43] <agcolom> because it is a very good demo in itself
[13:52:46] <toddmparker_> all stuff to think about
[13:53:08] <uGoMobi> our docs would still have to be fully accessible offline, right?
[13:54:08] <toddmparker_> that is the ideal, yes
[13:54:20] <toddmparker_> downloadable - right
[13:54:28] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:54:41] <toddmparker_> ui packages the demos but it's just raw pages for the most part
[13:54:42] <uGoMobi> so no php for a search tool
[13:54:48] <toddmparker_> ah, i see
[13:54:50] <toddmparker_> yeah
[13:55:10] <toddmparker_> be cool to use php to generate a hash of the key terms and use that locally via js
[13:55:31] <toddmparker_> when we deploy, generate a blob of json
[13:56:02] <uGoMobi> yes that could be a good solution
[13:56:13] <uGoMobi> manually maintaining a list just doesn't work
[13:57:15] <uGoMobi> maybe nice to have tags on each page with the keywords
[13:57:24] <uGoMobi> just thinking out loud
[13:58:08] <toddmparker_> yeah, if we used a meta tag with keywords
[13:58:29] <toddmparker_> thinking we could get by with a few hundred words at most
[13:59:05] <toddmparker_> maybe a grunt task that crawls the doc keyword tags and generates a list of words and links
[14:05:01] <uGoMobi> if we do an autocomplete it might be better if the search box is two columns width
[14:06:59] <toddmparker_> yeah

[14:36:46] <toddmparker_> just wanted to check in before i headed home
[14:37:16] <agcolom> Ok, goodnight everyone... Scott G had a look at the api docs and he gets an error in FF... so we need to look deeper into it... anyway it's not a show stopper for what I need to do at the moment... so I'll just carry on and we get sort that out later...

[14:58:08] <uGoMobi> seems like Github doesn't support relative links in the readme.md https://github.com/github/markup/issues/84 :(

[15:15:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yessir
[15:16:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: any ideas on the hashchange bit?
[15:16:56] <toddmparker_> i just wanted to check in before I left...sounded like bad news this morning but I'm not sure if we know what changed
[15:17:17] <toddmparker_> johnbender: guessing he's asleep?
[15:17:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: must be
[15:17:45] <toddmparker_> if you have time to keep looking at this, it's appreciated
[15:17:52] <toddmparker_> soudn slike 1.8.2 is our last hope to change thing sin core
[15:18:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: what was the last issue he was looking at?
[15:19:10] <uGoMobi> johnbender: _|Nix|_ fiixed this one today https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4994
[15:19:32] <uGoMobi> johnbender: but I think this one is caused by the same "core issue" https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4943
[15:20:38] <toddmparker_> yep, looking back that seems right
[15:20:40] <toddmparker_> 4993
[15:20:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm betting that's a selector issue
[15:20:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[15:20:51] <toddmparker_> ya
[15:20:53] <toddmparker_> sizzle
[15:20:54] <johnbender> he's adding the query param in
[15:20:58] <johnbender> calling it now
[15:21:01] <johnbender> I'll take a quick look
[15:21:12] <toddmparker_> ok
[15:21:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: need to grab some coffee
[15:21:22] <toddmparker_> i'd rather try and fix this then finalize 1.2
[15:21:29] <johnbender> I'm bushed after that meeting
[15:21:33] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes
[15:21:37] <johnbender> that needs fixing
[15:21:40] <johnbender> it's a dangerous issue
[15:21:41] <toddmparker_> for sure
[15:21:57] <toddmparker_> but the longer we sit here, the more we change
[15:22:10] <toddmparker_> already think we may need another rc
[15:22:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: has anyone verified with him the version of core that he's using?
[15:22:34] <johnbender> on 4943?
[15:22:38] <toddmparker_> but if we can fix this without too much fuss, maybe now
[15:22:51] <toddmparker_> good Q johnbender
[15:22:53] <toddmparker_> not sure
[15:23:06] <toddmparker_> might be worth trying to swap out core and see if you can repro
[15:23:09] <uGoMobi> johnbender: haven't checked his last comment but can check the code to see what version it is
[15:23:26] <toddmparker_> ok, i gotta drop but let's keep on this one
[15:24:16] <toddmparker_> tagged to 1.2, critical
[15:24:30] <johnbender> ll
[15:24:33] <johnbender> kk
[15:24:45] <toddmparker_> we can adjust after we give it a look
[15:24:49] <toddmparker_> easier to find :)
[15:25:19] <toddmparker_> k, bye
[15:27:23] <uGoMobi> bye
[15:28:29] <uGoMobi> johnbender: he used 1.8.1. (no bug with 1.7.1)
[15:28:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: definitely a sizzle issue then
[15:28:40] <johnbender> alright
[15:28:46] <johnbender> flerg
[15:29:01] <johnbender> I'm looking at _|Nix|_'s fix for 4994 quickly then I'll take a look at 4943
[15:37:49] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ lets chat quickly about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/8b52631375b112992c44f8acf4448de6a1c861e2 tomorrow, I'm not clear that some of the extra logic is necessary/helpful
[15:37:49] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[15:40:13] <uGoMobi> time to go to bed... goodnight all
[15:51:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: gnight
[17:06:32] <johnbender> ?tell toddmparker_ we don't support params to embedded pages https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4943
[17:06:32] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[17:17:33] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I don't know if you're around but that second issue isn't going to require a change in core or anything
[17:17:40] <johnbender> he was doing something we explicitly don't support
[17:17:57] <DaveMethvin> yay johnbender
[17:19:06] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: hilarity - 1.7.2 supported `$( "#foo?bar=baz:jqmData(role=page)" )` but not `$( "#foo?bar=baz" )
[17:19:13] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: parsers are hard :)
[17:19:36] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: $( location.hash ); is an xss waiting to happen
[17:19:46] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: massive agree
[17:20:08] <johnbender> I think I was quoted as saying "we're passing whatever bullshit is in the hash directly to the selector"
[17:20:36] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: now at least we use getElementByID directly and trust that it's implemented properly :)
[17:20:44] <DaveMethvin> the new parser has caught a lot of strange stuff that got thru berfore
[17:20:50] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: more's the betteri mo
[17:20:52] <johnbender> *imo
[17:20:57] <DaveMethvin> but yeah something simple and strict is a good idea
[17:21:13] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: it's flushing out all the weirdos :P
[17:21:26] <DaveMethvin> oh joy for us both :P
