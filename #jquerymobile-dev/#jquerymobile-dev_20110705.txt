[00:27:49] <Hirmon> Hi there
[01:32:35] <aaronmcadam> why doesn't dialog( 'open') work? i get 'uncaught exception: no such method 'open' for dialog widget instance'
[01:37:04] <aaronmcadam> any ideas
[01:40:34] <aaronmcadam> I don't wanna have to do something hacky like trigger a click on a button that opens a dialog
[02:40:57] <aaronmcadam> damn why is there a 'close' method and not an 'open' one for dialog? is there a reason?
[07:19:31] <xx3> alooooo

[11:12:49] <toddparker> hey all!
[11:13:36] <gseguin> 'sup?
[11:13:52] <gseguin> did you have a good holiday weekend?
[11:13:57] <toddparker> not too much gesguin, just getting caught up from the holiday weekend
[11:14:06] <toddparker> yeah, how about you?
[11:14:32] <gseguin> yeah went camping with a 20 month old
[11:14:43] <gseguin> that was fun
[11:14:59] <toddparker> yikes, how was the sleeping situation?
[11:15:07] <toddparker> i haven't braved that yet with my kiddies
[11:16:06] <gseguin> actually she slept great, we've upgraded from our backpacking tent to the "Kingdom 4" and that made car camping a whole different experience
[11:16:07] <gseguin> :)
[11:17:34] <toddparker> no more light camping for you. i prefer car camping anyway
[11:17:51] <toddparker> we got a cabin by a lake a few years ago so that's the extent of our roughing it
[11:18:04] <toddparker> maybe i'll pitch a tent outside :)
[11:18:12] <gseguin> :)
[11:18:24] <toddparker> so how it?
[11:18:40] <toddparker> are you still kicking around ideas for the animation stuff?
[11:19:16] <gseguin> going back to that today
[11:19:29] <toddparker> cool
[11:19:42] <gseguin> I was working on Jive stuff at the end of last week
[11:19:46] <toddparker> i think we should try to get beta 2 out within 2 weeks
[11:19:50] <toddparker> that woudl be a big one to land
[11:19:54] <toddparker> cool
[11:19:54] <gseguin> ok
[11:20:14] <gseguin> when are we going to integrate scrollview in master?
[11:20:16] <toddparker> trying to free up some time this week for scott to dig in too
[11:20:31] <toddparker> he's out most of today but back tomorrow
[11:20:48] <toddparker> we all need ot try and pick up kin's slack until _nickel is in full force later this month
[13:10:03] <gseguin> toddparker: adambiggs has not followed up on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1993
