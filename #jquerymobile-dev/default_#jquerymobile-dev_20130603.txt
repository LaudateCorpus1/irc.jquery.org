[07:44:18] <gseguin> Good morning
[07:46:27] <arschmitz> gseguin: morning
[07:51:18] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin and arschmitz 
[07:55:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this sound familier https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6070
[07:56:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, but not sure what version he is talking about
[07:56:04] <arschmitz> isnt that the same thing you saw until you upgraded
[07:56:16] <uGoMobi> if it has Turbo/Off-road or not
[07:56:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh yeah
[07:56:37] <gseguin> is toddmparker around?
[07:56:48] <arschmitz> gseguin: have not seen him so far
[07:57:01] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[07:57:06] <gseguin> thanks arschmitz
[07:57:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hey
[08:01:31] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[08:02:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: gseguin: what do you think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6068#issuecomment-18812007
[08:03:05] <uGoMobi> see also https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4805#issuecomment-7939551
[08:03:39] <uGoMobi> should we add something to our version of the widget factory to check if it has already been loaded?
[08:03:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i use ui with jqm all the time it works fine
[08:04:01] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[08:04:11] <uGoMobi> so it is fixed
[08:04:25] <uGoMobi> then I don't know what his problem is
[08:04:27] <arschmitz> yeah they have worked together fine since at least 1.2
[08:04:58] <arschmitz> and he is using 1.2.0
[08:05:38] <uGoMobi> I think I close and tell him to post test page
[08:06:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: give me 2 seconds im going to make a jsbin showing them working together 
[08:06:09] <uGoMobi> ok great
[08:10:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so apparently he also thinks we should magicly catch all HIS errors and make sense of them with other error messages???
[08:10:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah lol
[08:10:49] <arschmitz> thats not going to happen lol
[08:13:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: commented and clsoed
[08:20:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[08:21:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I commented and closed the Opera Mobile ticket
[08:22:41] <agcolom> Good afternoon everyone :-)
[08:23:05] <agcolom> I am finally getting some improvement on my back!
[08:23:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne, good to hear that
[08:24:12] <agcolom> Thanks :-) it's not perfect yet, but it is getting better. Now if it gets better each day it'll be good for the end of the week :-)
[08:24:44] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Excellent! Just don't lift anything heavy, and don't try to reach objects in awkward locations.
[08:25:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good comment on that slider perf ticket
[08:26:07] <uGoMobi> just the facts, I like that
[08:26:15] <_|Nix|_> In other news: D'oh! I just realized that we cannot save any DOM manip time by not relocating the popup, because we have to wrap it and insert the screen anyway, so we might as well relocate it.
[08:27:01] <_|Nix|_> Now, if we could do away with the popup wrapper, that'd be a different story. However, IIRC there is a /very/ good reason why we need it. uGoMobi probably knows the reason, too :)
[08:27:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: downside of relocating is some issues with forms
[08:27:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ooooh! That's bad!
[08:27:44] <_|Nix|_> Good point.
[08:27:53] <_|Nix|_> Well, then we enhance in place.
[08:27:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is a ticket for that
[08:28:00] <arschmitz> agcolom: good to hear your starting to feel a bit better
[08:28:18] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[08:28:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thank you thought it might settle down the masses for a bit
[08:28:41] <agcolom> Yes, I just need to be careful this week, and hopefully will be ok to travel!
[08:28:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I never considered that ... Like, if you have a form that has "Advanced..." that launches a popup. The advanced settings are still part of the same form.
[08:29:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Relocation must stop.
[08:29:59] <_|Nix|_> Make your voice heard! http://www.stoptherelocation.org/ Naw ... JK. The site DNE. :)
[08:30:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it was more like if your popup is part of a form, that part won't be submitted because we move it outside the form
[08:30:10] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:30:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, exactly.
[08:30:33] <arschmitz> hmmm something about a popup inside a form seems wrong to me
[08:30:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono. "Advanced..."
[08:30:56] <arschmitz> lol
[08:31:06] <_|Nix|_> I think that's a valid use case.
[08:31:44] <uGoMobi> it is
[08:31:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah actually the more i think about it it does make sense for some things
[08:32:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You wouldn't happen to have that issue in an open tab ... would you?
[08:32:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5780
[08:32:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[08:33:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure if this is related https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6014
[08:41:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: May or may not be. In that example, the submit button inside the popup is not placed outside its form. Instead, i suspect that adding visibility: hidden may be preventing it from submitting.
[08:42:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, if not relocating the popup fixes this issue, all the better.
[08:42:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh ok, might be fixed in "next" already then
[08:46:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Worth checking ...
[08:49:24] * _|Nix|_ is embarking on the journey of making in-place popups.
[08:55:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am afraid we can't get rid of the wrapper as long as we need to set max-width/height
[08:56:58] <uGoMobi> err we don't set max-height... so just max-width
[09:06:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I guess it's yet another widget that needs wrapping.

[12:51:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping! Do we have an issue/note/todo item/whatever about properly extending select to make it a custom select?
[12:51:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: i.e., custom select is not currently a proper extension.
[12:51:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well part of review is proper extensions
[12:51:51] <arschmitz> so kinda
[12:52:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think select is about the only extension left to canonicalize.

[23:09:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping! You up?
[23:12:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, when you have a chance, please have a look at http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/popup-inside.html ...
[23:14:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For some reason, the content div gets overflow-y: auto, even though it's explicitly set to visible in .ui-content.
[23:15:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If I don't move the popup out of the content header, it is affected by this and gets clipped/scrollbarred.
[23:15:23] <_|Nix|_> s/content header/content div/
[23:33:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so it seems that the popup only gets clipped if it's inside a fieldcontain.
[23:35:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... which is weird, because the overflow-y of a fieldcontain is explicitly set to visible ...
[23:44:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The fact that the fieldcontain has class ui-body is causing the clipping. If I remove ui-body, the clipping stops.
[23:46:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: More specifically, if I turn off position: relative; inside ui-body, then it doesn't clip.
[23:55:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The situation is no different on "next".
