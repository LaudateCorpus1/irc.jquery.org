[00:49:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, I will look into that
[00:49:50] <bot-t> (3 hours 17 mins ago) <arschmitz> tell uGoMobi: this line is causing issues with rangeslider handles https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.panel.css#L77 it causes z-index problems because it causes every single div to have its own stacking context. i could forsee this causing a lot of other problems as well.

[12:07:42] <uGoMobi> ?tell arschmitz: I removed the line that caused the issue with rangesliders. Added a note to the docs instead.
[12:07:43] <bot-t> uGoMobi, Okay.
[12:41:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok cool any negative side effects of that on the panel transitions? i know that was kicing in hardware accel on everything?
[12:41:17] <bot-t> (33 mins 30 secs ago) <uGoMobi> tell arschmitz: I removed the line that caused the issue with rangesliders. Added a note to the docs instead.
[12:41:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hey!
[12:42:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nah, transitions were good already without this
[12:42:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we are still 3D-ing the content wrapper, just not all divs inside the content anymore
[12:43:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so far this issue with column-count + form elements is the only issue reported so I added a note to the docs that you need to apply the fix in your custom CSS
[14:31:17] <rclarkson> is there a way to have a list view with multiple columns?
[14:37:49] <uGoMobi> rclarkson: is this what you mean https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4956 ?
[14:38:35] <rclarkson> uGoMobi: yeah thx
[14:38:58] <uGoMobi> rclarkson: I am working on that demo at the moment
[14:39:24] <rclarkson> uGoMobi: i see .. its not online yet?
[14:39:25] <uGoMobi> rclarkson: it will be available within few days
[14:39:31] <rclarkson> uGoMobi: cool
[14:39:36] <uGoMobi> rclarkson: no, not yet
[14:39:49] <rclarkson> ill check back some days later then
[14:44:02] <rclarkson> uGoMobi: can i ask if you have plans to incorporate it into the final release?
[14:45:13] <uGoMobi> rclarkson: we won't include the CSS for this in the framework, but add a demo where you can grab the CSS
[14:45:38] <rclarkson> uGoMobi: why is this? it seems to be a very appreciated feature
[14:45:48] <uGoMobi> rclarkson: for the 1.3 final release we are renewing the docs
[14:45:49] <rclarkson> makes sense for larger screens
[14:46:26] <uGoMobi> rclarkson: I agree that many people will like this
[14:46:41] <uGoMobi> rclarkson: but I think people also have there own preferences
[14:47:07] <rclarkson> uGoMobi: just curious .. why not go with some option like you always do? eg. :data-filter
[14:47:32] <rclarkson> :columns "2"
[14:47:32] <uGoMobi> so we think it's better to show how-to instead of adding CSS to the framework which is difficult to override
[14:47:42] <rclarkson> ok
[14:47:55] <uGoMobi> rclarkson: options add lot of code weight to the framework
[14:48:04] <rclarkson> yeah
[14:48:15] <uGoMobi> you have to add CSS/code for each option while people will only use one
[14:48:19] <uGoMobi> probably
[14:51:31] <uGoMobi> rclarkson: maybe we will add an extension for the listview widget for this in a future version, so you can include/exclude it when using the download builder
[14:51:54] <rclarkson> uGoMobi: that would be nice

[18:19:25] <toddmparker_> working om sprites
[18:19:33] <toddmparker_> hate these damn things
[18:19:34] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: ah cool
[18:19:38] <uGoMobi> lol
[18:19:43] <uGoMobi> SVGggg
[18:19:45] <toddmparker_> just following your instructions
[18:19:48] <toddmparker_> yep
[18:20:41] <toddmparker_> one thing: i'd like to make a demo on the icons page showing how to use the black icons as an override
[18:20:50] <toddmparker_> and how to remove the black disc
[18:21:28] <toddmparker_> say you had a listview and wanted to have a just have black arrows instead of white arrows in a black disc
[18:21:42] <toddmparker_> might need you help on the best way to do that override
[18:21:50] <uGoMobi> sure np
[18:22:05] <toddmparker_> we cna add the icons widget page tonight
[18:30:56] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: made the changes but things look a bit off
[18:31:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: did you also change the CSS?
[18:32:22] <arschmitz> hi toddmparker_ uGoMobi
[18:32:29] <uGoMobi> hi arschmitz 
[18:33:08] <arschmitz> that was a weird issue with the panels / sliders
[18:33:15] <arschmitz> took me a while to find the real cause
[18:34:12] <uGoMobi> yeah that 3D stuff is tricky
[18:34:21] <uGoMobi> fixes one thing, breaks another
[18:34:34] <arschmitz> yup
[18:37:52] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: yes
[18:38:03] <toddmparker_> it's...messy
[18:38:12] <toddmparker_> unless i mis-read your email
[18:38:32] <uGoMobi> hmm
[18:39:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: can you e-mail me the adjusted .png files?
[18:51:18] <toddmparker_> sure
[18:51:34] <toddmparker_> just the more i look at 'em, the more off they seem
[18:51:42] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi ^
[18:52:23] <uGoMobi> :(
[18:54:21] <arschmitz> iv always hated working with sprites!
[18:54:56] <toddmparker_> ugh
[18:55:04] <toddmparker_> you're right that the forms are off
[18:55:10] <toddmparker_> dunno where to start
[18:55:33] <toddmparker_> do i start with the 18px white and nudge the 36 to line up?
[18:55:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: they are so picky they all need to be picel perfect aligned
[18:55:59] <toddmparker_> i could just take the 36 sizes and scale them down
[18:57:50] <toddmparker_> let me try something
[18:57:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i havent even glanced at what you have going on with the view source and code highlighting
[18:58:25] <arschmitz> but how hard would it be to use code highlighting on the code sample that are not in view source in the docs
[18:58:31] <arschmitz> i mean demos

[19:00:34] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 140a74652 15Jasper de Groot: Demos: added classes and links to source files, removed superfluous primary-content wrapper.
[19:01:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not hard at all I think
[19:03:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure what you mean by "not in view source"
[19:04:43] <uGoMobi> you don't need to have the source markup wrapped in the demo div
[19:05:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/faq/question-template.html
[19:05:27] <arschmitz> to just add code highlghting to these samples
[19:05:42] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[19:06:13] <uGoMobi> you can just call the syntax hightlighter function
[19:07:36] <arschmitz> ok cool
[19:08:07] <arschmitz> i had not even look at it yet just was looking at that thinking it would look much nicer with it
[19:08:26] <toddmparker_> ok uGoMobi 
[19:08:32] <toddmparker_> i just emailed you the 4 files
[19:08:40] <toddmparker_> here's what i did:
[19:08:54] <toddmparker_> i took the 36px white sprite
[19:09:08] <toddmparker_> made the adjustments you recommended
[19:09:24] <toddmparker_> then sync'd that with the 36 black so they were both perfectly lined up
[19:09:31] <toddmparker_> I exported those
[19:09:59] <toddmparker_> then shunk it to 50% for the 18px size, sharpened and exposted those as the 18px versions
[19:10:10] <toddmparker_> looks a bit off now
[19:10:27] <toddmparker_> but at least it's 100% consistent across sizes and colors
[19:10:33] <uGoMobi> ok
[19:10:38] <uGoMobi> looking at it now
[19:10:59] <toddmparker_> do you have a retina device to test the hd?
[19:11:31] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes
[19:11:36] <toddmparker_> cool
[19:11:53] <toddmparker_> think we just need to re-finesse the positions based on how it really looks
[19:12:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: before I forget... you also need to define the "brush" that the highlighter should use (html, css, js, etc)
[19:13:14] <uGoMobi> you need to set that on the pre element
[19:13:28] <uGoMobi> but I can help you with making a template
[19:14:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i was just reading the documentation on the highlighter 
[19:15:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: can you mail the .png - they are embedded in the e-mail as a pic now
[19:15:25] <uGoMobi> as attachment
[19:15:53] <toddmparker_> ok
[19:16:02] <uGoMobi> cool
[19:17:32] <toddmparker_> emailed a zip
[19:19:20] <uGoMobi> yup got them, thanks
[19:28:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: the total size is off
[19:28:38] <toddmparker_> total size?
[19:28:48] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: the regular one should be 24 x 36px = 864px 
[19:29:04] <uGoMobi> but it is 877px
[19:29:37] <toddmparker_> crap
[19:29:43] <uGoMobi> HD: should be 2 x 864px = 1728px but it is 1280x
[19:29:45] <uGoMobi> px*
[19:29:48] <toddmparker_> so i dragged those into the email
[19:29:53] <toddmparker_> then deleted my local ones
[19:29:56] <toddmparker_> ugh
[19:29:59] <toddmparker_> gotta re-do
[19:31:30] <uGoMobi> I dunno how to do that alpha transparency
[19:33:15] <toddmparker_> in fireworks, my doc us 1728
[19:33:20] <toddmparker_> but it exposts at 1200
[19:33:22] <toddmparker_> wtf
[19:35:27] <uGoMobi> I need to get some sleep
[19:35:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: just let me know if you want me to look at something tomorrow morning

[19:55:58] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I had a quick look
[19:56:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: the problem is that the icons are not centered
[19:56:12] <toddmparker_> and...
[19:56:34] <toddmparker_> as in they aren't mathematically spaced?
[19:56:44] <toddmparker_> i honestly don't care about that
[19:56:59] <toddmparker_> esp. since this whole thing will be trashed in a few weeks
[19:57:13] <toddmparker_> i just want these to be consistent across colors/sizes
[19:57:14] <uGoMobi> for the 36 sprite the idea is 36px for each icon and 36px free space at the right side
[19:57:19] <toddmparker_> which they should be now
[19:57:26] <uGoMobi> but the icons aren't 36px
[19:57:41] <uGoMobi> so they need to be centered within the 36px
[19:58:08] <toddmparker_> but we can nudge with css anyway
[19:58:12] <uGoMobi> but the 2 new icons are aligned left
[19:58:41] <toddmparker_> the offsets need to be eyeballed to fit nicely within the circles anyway
[19:58:59] <toddmparker_> i see what you're saying with the new icons
[19:59:12] <toddmparker_> but that is hard to do unfortunately
[19:59:31] <toddmparker_> i'm not working in the source AI anymore
[19:59:38] <uGoMobi> I see
[20:00:05] <toddmparker_> so if we can just change the offset to be a few px over for those...
[20:00:12] <toddmparker_> at least they are consistent now
[20:00:20] <toddmparker_> the sprites were way off before
[20:00:28] <toddmparker_> between black/white
[20:00:34] <toddmparker_> and resolutions
[20:01:00] <toddmparker_> can we just switch to svg?!
[20:01:22] <arschmitz> toddmparker: lol
[20:01:25] <uGoMobi> :D
[20:01:36] <toddmparker_> such a tweaky process
[20:01:48] <toddmparker_> i've re-exported these a zillion times tonight
[20:01:50] <arschmitz> lets just pretend we didnt do a beta already and add some stuff lol
[20:02:06] <toddmparker_> always something is a bit off and I need to start over from scratch
[20:02:11] <toddmparker_> heh
[20:02:31] <toddmparker_> goal here is to make these suck slightly less
[20:02:43] <toddmparker_> then we can throw it all out and start over
[20:04:04] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: I added a placeholder heading here for the black icon & removing the disc
[20:04:06] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/icons/
[20:04:20] <toddmparker_> figure you'll come up with a better way to do this
[20:04:33] <toddmparker_> add any other icon related tips there
[20:05:53] <uGoMobi> ok
[20:06:04] <uGoMobi> but no more ICONS for today :)

[23:34:10] <_|Nix|_> Booo! toddmparker's method of injecting two tabbables before the first tabbable in a popup and after the last tabbable in a popup doesn't work, because I have no way of establishing what tabindex to give them. The reason I can't establish that is that, for example <input></input> will be added to the focus chain even though it doesn't have a tabindex attribute. So, if I want to add <div tabindex="???"> in front of that, then what valu
[23:47:52] <_|Nix|_> I guess we can document that, if you want focus restriction to work nicely, you should specify a tabindex for the widgets inside the popup. Otherwise, focus restriction will still work, but it'll be jerky.
