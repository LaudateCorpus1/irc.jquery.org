[03:03:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 27 new commits to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/Cn-OJg
[03:03:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Buttons: Adjusted CSS selector for fullsize button in toolbar. Fixes #4619 - Search input clear button gets unwanted padding when in header/footer. [1.1.2.] - Jasper de Groot
[03:03:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Header buttons: Added "button" to the selector. Fixes #4638 - Using button tag in header will show title in new line [1.1.2.] - Jasper de Groot
[03:03:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Textinput: added conditional call to disable() to the create function to make sure disabled elements get class ui-disabled. Fixes #4636 and #4637 - Text Input doesn't use ui-disabled class if disabled attribute is set in markup. [1.1.2.] - Jasper de Groot
[05:20:48] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender I have found other places where the popstate handler prevents a hashchange from being emitted.
[05:20:49] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[05:23:23] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender For example, if you revert the change where popup moved to using "navigate" (8b5624f) and try to open a popup off of docs/pages/popup/index.html?_=1341865217735&swarmURL=http%3A%2F%2Fswarm.jquery.org%2Findex.php%3Fstatus%3D2%26run_id%3D3667%26client_id%3D5035%26run_token%3D61958de2f054136c24650b27549760494ac4398c%26results_id%3D42869%26results_store_token%3D9e3ecfafcbf5e1c095f5372b1f7b00ee6c5c67a4 you get the same beh
[05:23:24] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[05:25:05] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender It seems that some modifications made during popstate lead some browsers (e.g. FF12 and Android 2.3.5) to conclude that emitting a hashchange signal is no longer necessary.
[05:25:05] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[05:27:39] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender Of course, with a plain URL (docs/pages/popup/index.html) the hashchange is emitted, so the pre-navigate popup works fine.
[05:27:40] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[05:57:47] <scott_gonzalez> You guys are rivaling UI with number of contributors.
[05:57:56] <scott_gonzalez> You might actually be 2 or 3 ahead of us.
[06:35:46] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Now, if only we would properly implement _setOption on all our widgets ...
[06:35:57] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: :)
[06:43:30] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Heh, options are tricky, but they're the key to making widgets awesome.
[06:44:46] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Agreed ... when you reviewed my on-the-fly optionst PR a few months back, you said the widget factory would have some improvements for not having to have a giant switch inside _setOption if you have lots of options. How's that going? What form does that support take?
[09:02:02] <toddparker> morning all
[09:02:21] <toddparker> i was going to push up 1.1.1 announcement stuff in the next hour
[09:02:38] <toddparker> johnbender et al - anything holding us back?
[09:06:41] <toddparker> looks like the 1.1.1 demos are up - thanks johnbender
[09:06:49] <toddparker> all the CDN links check out
[09:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> I may die of boredom tracking down your contributors :-P
[09:19:26] <tbenzige1> toddparker: ping
[09:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know if Jason Scott <jasscott@rim.com> and Jason Scott <me@jasondscott.com> are the same?
[09:27:56] <toddparker> tbenzige1: pong
[09:28:05] <toddparker> scott_gonzalez: yep
[09:28:10] <toddparker> hee
[09:28:17] <toddparker> i owe you many beers scott
[09:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:28:29] <toddparker> i can do that, just gimme a list
[09:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> Down to 13 people to track down.
[09:28:40] <toddparker> wow
[09:29:03] <toddparker> tbenzige1: i'm ready to push up the 1.1.1 announcement so if you want to deploy TR...
[09:29:12] <toddparker> i have the link somewhere
[09:29:19] <johnbender> toddparker: I don't think so
[09:29:20] <bot-t> (4 hours 8 mins 30 secs ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender I have found other places where the popstate handler prevents a hashchange from being emitted.
[09:29:21] <bot-t> (4 hours 5 mins 50 secs ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender For example, if you revert the change where popup moved to using "navigate" (8b5624f) and try to open a popup off of docs/pages/popup/index.html?_=1341865217735&swarmURL=http%3A%2F%2Fswarm.jquery.org%2Findex.php%3Fstatus%3D2%26run_id%3D3667%26client_id%3D5035%26run_token%3D61958de2f054136c24650b27549760494ac4398c%26results_id%3D42869%26results_store_token%3D9e3ecfafcbf5e1c095f5372b

[09:30:14] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: Was that "yep" that the two Jasons are the same?
[09:30:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: interesting
[09:30:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and in addition to that, we need to normalize some comparisons inside nav by wrapping both sides in decodeURIComponent()
[09:30:48] <johnbender> toddparker: that is I don't think there's anything holding us up
[09:31:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's what I figured
[09:31:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: there's a danger there though
[09:31:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What's that?
[09:31:24] <johnbender> because the swarm url is a url
[09:31:33] <johnbender> and by decoding it you're making it a part of the parent query string
[09:31:38] <johnbender> rather
[09:31:58] <johnbender> you're making the query string delimiters part of the parent query string
[09:32:02] <johnbender> which is an issue
[09:32:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Aaah, yes.
[09:32:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's just bad though - passing a URL as a query param ...
[09:32:53] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a list of team members other than jquery.org/team?
[09:33:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... or is there some canonical way of doing that?
[09:33:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the way it's been done
[09:33:27] <johnbender> it's pretty regular practice for web callbacks
[09:33:33] <johnbender> by encoding the url
[09:33:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hmmm ...
[09:34:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, it should be OK as long as we normalize during comparison, and we don't actually set anything ...
[09:34:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: s/during/only during/
[09:35:17] <johnbender> there was a ticket that introduced the decoding
[09:35:21] <johnbender> let me look that up
[09:35:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Because if we compare two strings which the browser would get confused over, that's fine, as long as we don't turn around and give the confusing string to the browser.
[09:36:14] <toddparker> scott_gonzalez: yes, the same. work vs. personal emails
[09:36:20] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:36:43] <toddparker> scott_gonzalez: not really. the team page is up-to-date
[09:36:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: correct
[09:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: Ok, I'll link to that at the top of the authors file.
[09:37:07] <toddparker> cool
[09:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like 195 authors.
[09:37:42] <scott_gonzalez> Need to do another pass through the names to check for duplicates though.
[09:38:30] <johnbender> toddparker: did you get my message about the contribs script?
[09:39:18] <toddparker> that's a lotta people
[09:39:27] <toddparker> johnbender: no, email?
[09:39:35] <toddparker> tbenzige1: http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller-test/ looks good
[09:39:40] <toddparker> i'll deploy
[09:39:55] <johnbender> toddparker: nope it was irc
[09:40:11] <toddparker> ah, i can look
[09:40:23] <johnbender> toddparker: you can do a `bash build/bin/contrib.sh ref ref`
[09:40:26] <johnbender> to get the list of commiters names
[09:40:50] <johnbender> so `bash build/bin/contrib.sh 1.1.0 1.1.1`
[09:41:02] <johnbender> would get you the names of the people that workd on commits between the two
[09:42:21] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/build/bin/contrib.sh

[09:42:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/PYnrzg
[09:42:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Coding standards: listview JS and CSS - whitespace and brackets on same line. - Jasper de Groot
[09:42:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Listview: Fixes read-only list numbering on browsers that don't support CSS pseudo classes. Classes are not applied yet so we can't check with .is(). - Jasper de Groot
[09:42:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Listview: Added support for start attribute on numbered listviews. Fixes #4613 - Ordered list ignores "start" attribute. - Jasper de Groot
[09:43:42] <toddparker> thanks johnbender
[09:44:02] <toddparker> very cool
[09:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Cool. Not sure if you do "thanks" in commits, but if you do, you can add: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-8-stable/build/release/prepare-release#L139
[09:45:07] <toddparker> alright, TR is now showing 1.1.1
[09:45:08] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/
[09:45:15] <toddparker> better push the rest of the stuff then
[09:45:20] <toddparker> 1.1.1 is a GO
[09:45:26] <_|Nix|_> \o/
[09:45:49] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I don't, I generally rewrite the author on a commit if I think that someone should get credit
[09:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: I've also run into problems sorting UTF-8 before, so I use this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-8-stable/build/release/prepare-release#L135
[09:45:53] <johnbender> but that's just me
[09:46:03] <uGoMobi> hi all!
[09:46:13] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: the LC_ALL?
[09:46:16] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: We do thanks for things like someone suggesting how to fix, but not providing code, etc.
[09:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Yeah, not sure why I needed the `col -b`
[09:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> Seems odd.
[09:46:39] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: right, I generally just give them the author in those cases, but I'm probably the only one
[09:46:45] <uGoMobi> tbenzige1: I see a hyperlink that shouldnt be there below "recent colors" on TR website
[09:46:51] * johnbender goes to update with LC_ALL
[09:49:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/_7M5ug
[09:49:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] added accounting for UTF-8 in contrib script, thanks to Scott Gonzalez :+1: - John Bender
[09:49:57] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: ^ :D :D
[09:50:31] <scott_gonzalez> Hah! Now you need the `grep -i thank` :-P
[09:50:56] * johnbender tries to be funny when given the opportunity
[09:51:17] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/07/12/jqm-1-1-1/
[09:52:13] <toddparker> alright…now on to 1.2 stuffs
[09:52:40] <toddparker> _|Nix|_ and johnbender - hows the android 2.3 nav stuff going? saw you guys were jamming on it
[09:52:50] <johnbender> toddparker: oh it's fine
[09:53:02] <tbenzige1> uGoMobi: are you talking about the colors… link?
[09:53:03] <johnbender> but there are some issues with urls encoded into the query string
[09:53:08] <johnbender> eg, testswarm urls
[09:53:09] <johnbender> :D
[09:53:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: is there any chance you want to keep looking at that
[09:53:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Sure.
[09:53:39] <johnbender> I'm staring at OSCON and Throne of JS next week and I need to get started on my preso :(
[09:53:40] <uGoMobi> tbenzige1: yeah
[09:53:47] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: one million thank yous
[09:54:01] <johnbender> make sure take your machete with you whilst working in nav :(
[09:54:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I've narrowed it down to one spot: inside directHashChange, we need to compare URLs after we've decodeURIComponent()-ed both sides.
[09:54:17] <tbenzige1> uGoMobi: it's a way to add a custom draggable color
[09:54:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you get that sorted out it should resolve most of the issues with testswarm
[09:54:22] <tbenzige1> are you just talking about the style?
[09:54:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: amazing
[09:55:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Of course, this might be the reason behind some of the hashchange wonkiness in FF too.
[09:55:20] <uGoMobi> tbenzige1:the link doesn't repond, what is it suppose to do?
[09:55:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Don't get me wrong - "navigate" was absolutely necessary for Android 2.3.5, because it was breaking with absolutely mundane URLs as well.
[09:55:54] <johnbender> yar
[09:55:58] <tbenzige1> uGoMobi: it's working on my end. There should be a color picker that pops up
[09:56:04] <Wilto> Hell of a job, folks.
[09:56:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm just curious if reverting that and looking at some comparisons inside pushState will get rid of that phenomenon on FF.
[09:56:26] <uGoMobi> tbenzige1: let me test other browser
[09:56:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It'd also help if I could run the totality of the test suite.
[09:56:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Changing nav can have subtle effects all over the place.
[09:57:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I dunno why it doesn't work for me.
[09:57:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I had some issues running it locally as well yesterday
[09:57:28] <johnbender> ugh
[09:57:31] <johnbender> confluence of issues
[09:57:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: running just nav should be enough
[09:57:57] <johnbender> we can sort it out after that
[09:58:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: In that case, nav has some failures on FF out of the box - failures /not/ multiplied by my change. All's green in Chrome.
[09:58:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: With and without wonky URLs.
[09:59:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm, it might be good to address those directly before addressing the wonky urls
[09:59:14] <uGoMobi> tbenzige1: sorry, it turned out to be Chrome's cache that was messing it up here... now it looks ok and works as expected
[09:59:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, and in FF, sometimes the nav tests, when they stop, are not styled at all.
[09:59:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, so we want nav to pass in FF. Period. Correct?
[09:59:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's entirely possibly that there are time senstive tests in there too
[09:59:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yar
[09:59:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Whew!
[10:00:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ... so ... I'll investigate whether we need to normalize some more comparisons in pushState, and then I'll push this one comparison, and then I'll look at the test failures. What say you?
[10:01:03] <johnbender> sounds good
[10:01:15] <johnbender> any progress made in sorting out the test failures would be a big help
[10:01:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Sprinkle in some good olefashioned popup to give the whole thing colour ...

[12:37:49] <uGoMobi> ah ok, thats what I was looking for
[12:37:52] <uGoMobi> thanks :)
[12:38:21] <agcolom> anyone has any idea for this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4583#issuecomment-6841271 ?
[12:38:21] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4583 on jquery-mobile (drkhdr; 2w, 6d ago): form submit fails if content-type is XHTML
[12:42:26] <DaveMethvin> agcolom: that failing page doesn't validate ... getting it to do that would be a start  http://validator.w3.org
[12:42:42] <DaveMethvin> I've never seen an xhtml file with an  html5 doctype???
[12:45:12] <toddparker> we got rid of the iOS # hack a while ago, didn't we?
[12:45:13] <toddparker> http://scottwb.com/blog/2012/06/29/jquery-mobile-breaks-your-hrefs-on-ios-mobile-safari/
[12:45:28] <toddparker> definitely fixed in 1.1.1, right?
[12:48:23] <uGoMobi> gseguin reverted that yes
[12:48:42] <uGoMobi> have to check if it was picked into 1.1-stable
[12:54:03] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yep, the revert commit is in 1.1-stable
[12:56:07] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the issue with xhtml + html5 might have to do with mime type settings. See also http://html5doctor.com/html-5-xml-xhtml-5/
[12:57:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sorry, I now see he did set the mime type in the head
[13:11:50] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, I'm running out of ideas on this one!
[13:13:34] <agcolom> DaveMethvin: Thanks! I'll get him to do that.
[13:14:01] <agcolom> any expert in textarea scrollHeight?
[13:15:46] <toddparker> i'm gonna get some ice cream for sure
[13:16:17] <agcolom> hey toddparker, I'm working on something, but it doesn't work yet! Can I still show you?
[13:16:28] <agcolom> it sorts of half works!
[13:16:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I see he has action="" set on his form... I am not sure if that's allowed
[13:16:52] <toddparker> agcolom: sure!
[13:17:04] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/uqavil/8
[13:17:08] <agcolom> toddparker: ^
[13:17:15] <agcolom> add lines
[13:17:22] <agcolom> (using return)
[13:17:37] <agcolom> then delete lines using the backspace
[13:17:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you can post this link in a comment on the xhtml5 form issue http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fform-submit-xhtml-jqm.herokuapp.com%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[13:17:59] <toddparker> cool
[13:18:01] <agcolom> the problem is it doesn't know when to stop removing lines!
[13:18:06] <toddparker> so many alerts
[13:18:13] <toddparker> yikes
[13:18:18] <agcolom> oh yes sorry!
[13:18:20] <toddparker> it's hard
[13:18:21] <agcolom> hold on!
[13:18:36] <toddparker> you need to know how many lines the text will wrap to
[13:19:07] <toddparker> some have resorted to having a hidden div with the same styles and measuring the height.
[13:19:11] <toddparker> but that's pretty heavy
[13:19:22] <agcolom> removed them now...
[13:20:13] <agcolom> (if you reload it should be ok)
[13:20:33] <agcolom> yes, I think it'd be a nice addition... when it works!
[13:21:50] <agcolom> what I am trying to do is measure if we remove the line whether this will cause the clientHeight to be smaller than the scrollHeight, but I can't get the measure right!
[13:26:52] <agcolom> (you know, that was my old old issue opened 9months ago ;-) )
[13:27:09] <agcolom> I did have a look at the elastic plugin but it is massive!
[13:32:41] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Thanks a lot. I've commented with your suggestion and DaveMethvin's.
[13:37:01] <agcolom> toddparker: I've found this: http://jsfiddle.net/CbqFv/show/
[13:37:20] <agcolom> it doesn't look like a textarea but it is....
[13:39:35] <i-hate-dave> Yippie, build fixed!
[13:39:35] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #323: FIXED in 19 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/323/
[13:40:23] <DaveMethvin> he must really hate me, everyone else  has working builds :(
[13:40:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 5 new commits to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/1y5Yhg
[13:40:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Coding standards: listview JS and CSS - whitespace and brackets on same line. - Jasper de Groot
[13:40:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Listview: Fixes read-only list numbering on browsers that don't support CSS pseudo classes. Classes are not applied yet so we can't check with .is(). - Jasper de Groot
[13:40:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Listview: Added support for start attribute on numbered listviews. Fixes #4613 - Ordered list ignores "start" attribute. - Jasper de Groot
[13:41:08] <uGoMobi> DaveMethvin: Core - last succes N/A :(
[13:42:03] <DaveMethvin> you have to go back to the paper versions for that
[13:42:55] <uGoMobi> that must have been a rock solid build :)
[13:43:23] <agcolom> ok everyone, have a great evening! I am falling asleep... Will be dreaming of textareas and scrollHeight all night I'm sure!
[13:43:39] <uGoMobi> sounds exciting... good night Anne
[13:43:45] <agcolom> Goodnight!
[13:46:00] <agcolom> toddparker: you can retry that link, all alerts are now removed...but for the moment it still doesn't know when to stop... so at the end it removes one line, then adds it, removes it...
[13:54:00] <toddparker> agcolom - it still seems to get confused
[13:54:09] <toddparker> goodnight agcolom
