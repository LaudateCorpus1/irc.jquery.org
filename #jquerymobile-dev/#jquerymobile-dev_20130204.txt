[05:50:18] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:54:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you have a fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5514 ?
[05:55:12] <uGoMobi> I know we looked at it end of last week
[05:55:32] <arschmitz> yeah sorry you had a working fix for it i thought?
[05:55:54] <arschmitz> we had tried a way i was and you were but yours worked better i think
[05:56:12] <uGoMobi> well I just changed your JS Bin to use blur()
[05:57:01] <arschmitz> oh ok 
[05:57:23] <arschmitz> i thought we were not supposed to commit any fixes after friday though?
[06:00:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: wow someone just donated me an htc incredible for testing!
[06:00:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh that's nice :)
[06:01:41] <arschmitz> yeah guess they upgraded a while back and still had it and heard i will take phones for testing
[06:02:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I set milestone 1.3.1 for 5514... no last minute rush fixes before RC
[06:02:31] <arschmitz> ok sounds good
[06:02:38] <uGoMobi> we need more time to test that
[06:03:00] <uGoMobi> just checking if you had the fix already but forgot to commit or something
[06:03:01] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:03:07] <arschmitz> im bummed its too late one those fixed toolbar issues too i fixed part of them but guess now all of it
[06:03:32] <arschmitz> but no matter how long we wait and try to fix there will always be more :|
[06:04:38] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[07:04:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i like it when people actually appreciate our efforts and dont just complain makes me want to help a lot morel ol
[07:05:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[07:06:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ie: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5514#issuecomment-13080502
[07:06:03] <uGoMobi> that's a nice comment of them
[07:06:26] <arschmitz> yeah all too often people do nothing but complain

[08:25:42] <toddmparker> think we're ready to deploy
[08:25:46] <toddmparker> yup
[08:25:47] <johnbender> kk
[08:26:14] <toddmparker> then i'll see if xavier can update the TR and gseguin can do the same for the download builder before I announce
[08:26:56] <toddmparker> hope that is the right file path:
[08:26:58] <toddmparker> code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.0-rc.1/jquery.mobile-1.3.0-rc.1.min.css
[08:27:03] <toddmparker> johnbender ^^
[08:27:37] <johnbender> toddmparker: should be, let me deploy real quick and we can check

[08:39:13] <toddmparker> that seemed to work well johnbender 
[08:39:40] <johnbender> toddmparker: yep
[08:40:43] <Wilto> Hey, any of you wanna write for ALA?
[08:41:50] <johnbender> Wilto: do they publish math? :)
[08:42:05] <toddmparker> naw

[08:52:29] <johnbender> toddmparker: you had some issue with the current navigation docs eh?
[08:52:59] <johnbender> I can work on cleaning that up today if you want
[08:57:11] <toddmparker> yeah, that would be cool.
[08:57:25] <toddmparker> agcolom: wanted some help figuring out how to document that clearly
[08:58:36] <toddmparker> johnbender: the RC stuff looks good, just tested the zip
[08:58:41] <johnbender> toddmparker: cool
[08:58:47] <toddmparker> so I have release notes ready for 1.1.2 and 1.2.1
[08:59:18] <toddmparker> if we wanted to do an RC for those, what do you think we need to do? just run the unit tests and do a quick device test?
[08:59:43] <johnbender> toddmparker: well we have tests for those stable branches so in theory they should be tested already
[08:59:52] <toddmparker> cool
[09:00:20] <toddmparker> so maybe we can do a deploy on those later and i'll work on the RC logistics
[09:00:41] <toddmparker> actually, i'd need to update the docs for each of those to point to the RC and such
[09:00:58] <toddmparker> i'll do that when I can, then give you a heads up that we're ready
[09:00:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker: cranking out the releases
[09:01:09] <toddmparker> figure we can do a quick RC, then go final a week after
[09:01:10] <johnbender> toddmparker: sounds good
[09:01:12] <toddmparker> yeah!
[09:01:20] <toddmparker> want to get all caught up
[09:01:25] <johnbender> toddmparker: any specifics on what's needed for nav in the new docs?
[09:01:25] <toddmparker> so we can just focus on 1.4
[09:01:28] <arschmitz> be good to get those done and move on full force to 1.4
[09:01:30] <arschmitz> yup
[09:01:33] <johnbender> some comprehensive overview?
[09:02:12] <toddmparker> johnbender: yeah, i think it's been a long time since anyone really looked at those and figure out what stuff needs to be clarified
[09:02:26] <johnbender> toddmparker: so just a reset on the originals then
[09:02:29] <johnbender> clarified and cleaned up
[09:02:30] <toddmparker> arschmitz: you also might have ideas on the nav docs
[09:02:35] <toddmparker> yeah
[09:02:44] <johnbender> toddmparker: where would that go in the new docs?
[09:02:52] <arschmitz> are we talking the demos section or api just so im clear lol?
[09:03:01] <toddmparker> agcolom had a google doc this weekend with remaining stuff to be added to the api docs
[09:03:11] <johnbender> arschmitz: I think something akin to the current nav "overview"
[09:03:35] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah i just wasent sure if you were talking about for the demos or the api?
[09:03:35] <toddmparker> two things: make sure the nag stuff is filled out and right on api.jquerymobile.com
[09:03:41] <johnbender> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-navmodel.html
[09:03:56] <toddmparker> and think about how to provide a better overview in english ^^ there
[09:04:02] <arschmitz> ok 
[09:04:02] <johnbender> yah
[09:04:18] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz, toddmparker ping me if it happens again
[09:04:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker: we started to talk about the overview one when i was down last week
[09:04:24] <toddmparker> actually here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/ajax-nav/
[09:04:24] <johnbender> it's page centric in the "old" docs
[09:04:40] <toddmparker> i munged a bunch of old docs pages together there
[09:04:57] <toddmparker> some of that can be cut out, some is outdated
[09:05:32] <arschmitz> yeah that page is a beast!
[09:05:34] <johnbender> yah I think we can slim it down a lot
[09:05:39] <toddmparker> cool
[09:05:40] <arschmitz> for sure
[09:05:55] <toddmparker> so let's just focus on that one page 
[09:06:12] <toddmparker> even if it's pretty long…how the heck do you explain how to work with the nag model
[09:06:15] <toddmparker> nav
[09:06:34] <johnbender> I don't think it should cover workign with the nav model
[09:06:38] <toddmparker> this content needs a home too - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-scripting.html
[09:06:41] <johnbender> I think that should be part of the api specifics
[09:07:01] <johnbender> hmm
[09:07:04] <johnbender> 1. An overview
[09:07:06] <toddmparker> i'm good with whatever you think is right. rip it apart
[09:07:15] <johnbender> 2. An events
[09:07:21] <johnbender> page
[09:07:39] <toddmparker> that seems like a good high level way to chunk it
[09:07:50] <johnbender> hmm
[09:07:52] <arschmitz> yeah i think so
[09:07:53] <johnbender> needs more thinking
[09:08:03] <arschmitz> i think transitions should be broken out 
[09:08:06] <toddmparker> what we have now is scatted, old and confusing
[09:08:31] <toddmparker> arschmitz: that can just be a link now to http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/transitions/
[09:08:42] <arschmitz> ok that works
[09:09:03] <johnbender> toddmparker: arschmitz: I assume this should go under Misc?
[09:09:06] <johnbender> in the api docs?
[09:09:18] <toddmparker> that "scripting" page above was tacked on to cover some common mis-conceptions/confusion
[09:09:20] <johnbender> or are we simply organizing this in the demo docs
[09:09:35] <arschmitz> i think api should just cover the api
[09:09:48] <arschmitz> i think this stuff should be in demo docs
[09:10:02] <toddmparker> johnbender: or "reference"?
[09:10:23] <toddmparker> in that demos page, let's cover the higher level stuff
[09:10:24] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah that's the other, let me see what the UI folks have in those sections
[09:10:39] <johnbender> toddmparker: so we are going to maintain a demos page then?
[09:10:46] <toddmparker> then make a page in the API docs that knits together the events and methods into a narrative and links to them
[09:11:11] <toddmparker> johnbender: yes. think we need to cover what the nag model is in the demos
[09:11:26] <toddmparker> autocorrect keeps changing nav > nag
[09:11:33] <johnbender> toddmparker: that will work better for building a $.mobile.navigation demo
[09:11:41] <toddmparker> right
[09:11:45] <johnbender> hmm
[09:12:29] <toddmparker> the issue now is we have a pile of events and methods but don't' do a great job explaining how they fit together and should be used
[09:12:57] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think the demo we talked about with the alerts can do a good job of explaining events
[09:13:03] <toddmparker> yeah
[09:13:16] <arschmitz> i can handle putting all the event stuff together
[09:13:54] <arschmitz> johnbender: maybe you can take care of the methods. then what evers left after that we can work throguh?
[09:14:09] <johnbender> arschmitz: well the methods are covered for nav
[09:14:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: I can certainly do a demo
[09:14:22] <arschmitz> no i mean in the demos
[09:14:31] <johnbender> yah I'll work on that
[09:14:44] <arschmitz> ok and ill work on demos for the events 
[09:15:03] <arschmitz> i think the key here is to add explination not just document them explain how they all work together
[09:15:53] <toddmparker> right
[09:16:19] <toddmparker> the api docs will cover each atomic method but there is no narrative around 'em
[09:16:28] <arschmitz> exactly same with events
[09:16:34] <toddmparker> right
[09:16:43] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker: is there anything special I have to do to work with the new embedded demos?
[09:16:46] <johnbender> build step?
[09:17:12] <arschmitz> johnbender: its the same as the old docs just need to set up the view source to work where you want it
[09:17:27] <arschmitz> which there is a template for that uGoMobi: made
[09:17:56] <johnbender> arschmitz: i'm confused
[09:18:06] <toddmparker> right, for demos in the new /demos/ folder in master, it's easy. just add the view source wrapper
[09:18:24] <toddmparker> for the API docs, it's different. agcolom needs to help you there
[09:18:34] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah I've got the api repo setup
[09:18:41] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[09:18:50] <johnbender> no idea what the "view source wrapper" is
[09:18:52] <arschmitz> johnbender: but we are talking about demos here not api.jquerymobile.com
[09:19:02] <toddmparker> maybe just take a look at another api page with a demo to see how it's set up
[09:19:27] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker: I'm asking how I view the current demos
[09:19:38] <johnbender> I can copy paste just as well as the next guy
[09:19:43] <johnbender> :)
[09:19:44] <toddmparker> on the API site?
[09:19:44] <arschmitz> http://jquerymobile.com/docs/demos
[09:19:58] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[09:19:59] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom 1.2-stable build #70: FIXED in 19 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%201.2-stable/70/
[09:19:59] <toddmparker> problem is we have two "demos"
[09:20:04] <arschmitz> oops
[09:20:09] <arschmitz> jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos
[09:20:16] <johnbender> one sec
[09:21:11] <johnbender> got it
[09:21:12] <johnbender> sorry
[09:21:15] <johnbender> I had to do a quick vm swap
[09:21:18] <johnbender> :)
[09:21:22] <arschmitz> cool
[09:23:55] <toddmparker> all clear?
[09:24:15] <toddmparker> i think i'd vote to move as much as possible over to the API site
[09:25:09] <toddmparker> and the demos can just be for more casual examples and explanation 
[09:25:27] <toddmparker> maybe we just need a "guides" section in the API site
[09:25:34] <toddmparker> and we remove that from demos
[09:26:09] <toddmparker> or just use reference for articles that give overviews or cover non-API stuff like theming
[09:26:13] <arschmitz> if its pure narative i think that makes sense if there is no need for the demo aspect of it
[09:26:23] <toddmparker> right
[09:29:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: why don't we split it up along the lines of what I've proposed as the next navigation move
[09:30:19] <arschmitz> johnbender: what do you mean exactly?
[09:30:43] <johnbender> arschmitz: there's the hash/pushstate/navigation event handling
[09:30:55] <johnbender> and then there's the ui state/content management
[09:31:09] <arschmitz> ahh ok
[09:31:24] <johnbender> so I'm going to build a simple demo of the navigation functionality
[09:31:48] <johnbender> using just navigate bindings and $.mobile.navigate
[09:32:05] <johnbender> then we might include a demo for page loading
[09:32:12] <johnbender> and maybe some events
[09:32:22] <arschmitz> ok
[09:32:26] <johnbender> something like that
[09:32:35] <johnbender> the api docs should probably follow the same course
[09:32:47] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:32:53] <arschmitz> makes sense to me
[09:33:06] <johnbender> then, when we move a lot of the nav functionality into a widget we can just push a lot of it in there
[09:33:16] <arschmitz> yup
[09:33:47] <agcolom> johnbender: Congratulations on the uk talk!!!!! That is fantastic! 
[09:34:18] <johnbender> agcolom: ... did they announce it or something?
[09:34:28] <agcolom> yes, this morning (uk time)
[09:34:31] <johnbender> agcolom: either way super excited
[09:34:39] <johnbender> agcolom: where did they announce
[09:34:52] <agcolom> on twitter... I'll get you the link.
[09:35:14] <toddmparker> yeah, uk is great - congrats johnbender 
[09:35:23] <toddmparker> i had a great time there last year
[09:35:57] <toddmparker> agcolom: johnbender can look at the API stuff today
[09:36:02] <toddmparker> did you have Q's for him?
[09:36:17] <johnbender> agcolom: toddmparker: yah happy to answer questions
[09:36:25] <johnbender> I'm just going to plug away on this demop
[09:36:27] <johnbender> *demo
[09:36:39] <toddmparker> agcolom: what do you think about having more pages int eh API docs for general info, overviews, etc.
[09:36:57] <agcolom> johnbender: https://twitter.com/jquk/status/298366420541120513
[09:37:04] <toddmparker> this kind of stuff could be moved out of demos and either be an API page or an article on learn.jquery - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/guides/
[09:37:22] <toddmparker> so demos are just demos, widgets and the Q&A stuff
[09:37:31] <agcolom> toddmparker: yes, happy to have more pages in the api docs for general info, etc.
[09:37:45] <arschmitz> i think it really makes the most sense that way
[09:37:51] <toddmparker> cool. so should we put these in "reference"
[09:38:02] <agcolom> yes, that's a good idea
[09:38:09] <toddmparker> or re-name that to guides & reference?
[09:38:18] <arschmitz> hmm do you think refrence makes the most sense for name
[09:38:22] <johnbender> agcolom: nice!
[09:38:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker : yeah that sounds better
[09:38:26] <johnbender> man I'm in good company there
[09:38:33] <agcolom> yep, can do that as well. 
[09:38:33] <toddmparker> yeah, we need a re-name
[09:38:37] <toddmparker> cool agcolom 
[09:38:59] <agcolom> johnbender: you are indeed! Great lineup! (hope that's a correct English phrase!)
[09:39:07] <johnbender> agcolom: it is
[09:39:18] <johnbender> a great lineup and the correct phrase :)
[09:39:52] <agcolom> johnbender: They sold 25% of the early bird ticket in the morning! No pressure then ;-)
[09:40:04] <johnbender> agcolom: I
[09:40:09] <toddmparker> arschmitz: wonder if in /demos/ if we should change the homepage and panel to just have 3 "tabs"
[09:40:11] <johnbender> agcolom: I'm getting to enjoy giving talks
[09:40:19] <johnbender> especially since I already know people like the one I'll be giving
[09:40:20] <toddmparker> widgets | demos | q&a
[09:40:32] <toddmparker> each would have a list view with a filter
[09:40:42] <arschmitz> that could work
[09:40:52] <toddmparker> not sure if that's better than now
[09:41:03] <arschmitz> hmm im not sure either
[09:41:15] <arschmitz> iv done tabbed list views before and liked them a lot
[09:41:19] <toddmparker> needs more thinking
[09:41:27] <arschmitz> but im not usre its right for this
[09:41:33] <toddmparker> yeah
[09:41:38] <toddmparker> could be heavy
[09:41:40] <agcolom> toddmparker: are we going for guides and reference or guides & reference?
[09:41:57] <toddmparker> either works for me. do you have a pref?
[09:42:15] <arschmitz> i officially have no prefrence on & vs and lol
[09:42:54] <agcolom> I have no pref either... well I like the '&' so will try that...
[09:43:15] <agcolom> I think it works better visually
[09:43:16] <arschmitz> agcolom: if you like the & isnt that a pref lol ?
[09:43:33] <agcolom> yes, I forgot to add actually ;-)
[09:43:55] <agcolom> 'actually' I may have a slight pref 
[09:44:24] <arschmitz> :)
[09:44:29] <agcolom> and I submitted my last assignement for my PG CErt last night! I am now Coursework free!!!!!!
[09:48:45] <toddmparker> agcolom: great news. mist feel nice.
[09:48:52] <toddmparker> MUST
[09:48:55] <toddmparker> geez.
[09:49:03] <toddmparker> ok, TR is updated.
[09:49:14] <toddmparker> is gseguin around to update the download builder?
[09:51:17] <toddmparker> or does anyone else know how to do that?
[09:54:42] <agcolom> toddmparker: yes it feels really nice :-) (been doing it on top of everything else for 1y and a half)! 
[09:56:12] <toddmparker> yikes
[09:58:46] <toddmparker> think i'm going to announce RC1
[09:58:55] <toddmparker> we can update the download builder later today
[09:58:59] <toddmparker> any objections?
[10:02:36] <agcolom> have all the 'old docs' changes been made?
[10:02:41] <toddmparker> Too late :) http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/02/04/jquery-mobile-1-3-0-rc1-released/
[10:02:56] <toddmparker> agcolom: meaning updating the CDN links to RC1?
[10:03:02] <toddmparker> yep, did that this morning
[10:03:02] <agcolom> yes
[10:03:06] <agcolom> cool!
[10:03:12] <toddmparker> checklist in hand
[10:03:39] <toddmparker> we can start prepping the same for 1.2.1 in 1.2-stable and 1.1.2 in the 1.1-stable branches
[10:03:52] <toddmparker> dunno if you want to help with that
[10:04:06] <toddmparker> lots of releases in the pipeline
[10:05:16] <agcolom> yep, I'll try to finish event in hte api docs tonight.
[10:08:22] <toddmparker> nice
[10:08:48] <toddmparker> great work everyone. 1.3 is a great release. thanks for all the time you all put into this.
[10:09:37] <arschmitz> simultanious champagne corks go off around the world!
[10:09:45] <arschmitz> :)
[10:13:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker: something is weird with themeroller
[10:13:29] <arschmitz> on 1.3
[10:13:57] <arschmitz> http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/
[10:14:11] <arschmitz> look at the list's
[10:14:17] <arschmitz> swatch a is fine
[10:14:25] <arschmitz> but swatches after that are funky
[10:15:49] <agcolom> arschmitz: all looks good to me on FF
[10:16:20] <arschmitz> agcolom: on 1.3 swatch a does not have a linked list item and the rest dont
[10:16:30] <arschmitz> and the headers on the rest dont have all 4 rounded corners?
[10:20:18] <agcolom> arschmitz: this is what I get: http://f.cl.ly/items/0L053k0O2K2S0g010o3F/TR1.tiff 
[10:21:03] <arschmitz> yeah thats a lot different then im getting in chrome
[10:21:51] <arschmitz> im trying to check it in firefox but its being a pain ll
[10:23:43] <jlembeck> arschmitz: which version of Chrome? I'm getting this - https://www.evernote.com/shard/s41/sh/793f713b-40fb-4d80-ad0e-c879bd277262/382b34215a9d29d8588cf4b490772af2/deep/0/Screenshot%202/4/13%2010:23%20AM.jpg
[10:24:15] <jlembeck> In 24.0.1312.57 on OS X 10.8.2
[10:24:17] <arschmitz> hmmm let me clear my cache just to be sure its not something weird
[10:24:30] <arschmitz> im on 25.....
[10:24:34] <arschmitz> windows 7
[10:24:38] <arschmitz> atm
[10:26:56] <toddmparker> arschmitz: try a cache dump
[10:27:06] <toddmparker> i had to do a few hard refreshes
[10:27:19] <arschmitz> yeah that fixed it was cache some portion of the page in a weird weird way lol
[10:27:29] <mspisars> arschmitz: im on chrome 25 win 7 here, no issues
[10:27:30] <toddmparker> iframe
[10:27:46] <arschmitz> yeah its all good now
[10:29:01] <toddmparker> alright
[10:29:11] <toddmparker> no commits to master except for demo stuff
[10:29:39] <toddmparker> until we hit final
[10:29:43] <arschmitz> yup
[10:31:48] <agcolom> arschmitz: I've tried all my browsers, all fine everywhere...
[10:32:05] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah it was a cacheing issue
[10:32:07] <arschmitz> its all set
[10:32:12] <agcolom> good :-)
[10:36:22] <jlembeck> woo!
[10:36:29] <toddmparker> johnbender: do you have IE handy?
[10:36:41] <toddmparker> IE10 rather
[10:37:00] <johnbender> toddmparker: no :(
[10:37:04] <toddmparker> hmm
[10:37:06] <johnbender> toddmparker: wait
[10:37:12] <johnbender> toddmparker: if browserstack does I do
[10:37:12] <arschmitz> i have it on browserstack
[10:37:13] <toddmparker> you can see this on browserstack. they have IE10
[10:37:14] <johnbender> toddmparker: why
[10:37:16] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5558#issuecomment-13075742
[10:37:41] <toddmparker> basically, you can see the URL pop up on a things like custom select menus
[10:37:54] <toddmparker> this guy is saying it's firing off a request too
[10:38:08] <toddmparker> definitely some oddness in IE10's URL business
[10:38:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: in ie10 on browserstack there is no http request i tried it already
[10:38:14] <johnbender> toddmparker: so you want to check if its ie10 too?
[10:38:21] <johnbender> hrm
[10:38:27] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah? do you see the URL pop up?
[10:38:31] <arschmitz> yes
[10:38:37] <arschmitz> but thats just hover behivor
[10:38:45] <toddmparker> I could repro that there, looks the same as on WinRT (Surface)
[10:38:48] <arschmitz> there is no request
[10:38:57] <toddmparker> so is he just wrong?
[10:38:58] <johnbender> toddmparker: arschmitz: is he using it in the browser or to build an app?
[10:39:12] <arschmitz> if you go to desktop mode on browserstack and open the inspector
[10:39:23] <toddmparker> can't decide if this is him being wrong, a bug in IE10, or something we can actually fix on our side
[10:39:27] <arschmitz> there are no http requests sent from his test page
[10:39:53] <toddmparker> hmm
[10:40:04] <toddmparker> arschmitz: would you mind commenting and expelling what you saw?
[10:40:10] <toddmparker> explaining
[10:40:10] <arschmitz> sure
[10:40:32] <toddmparker> sorry johnbender, didn't know arschmitz had gotten this far
[10:40:36] <arschmitz> he says he is seeing a request with fiddler 
[10:40:48] <johnbender> toddmparker: no worries
[10:41:17] <arschmitz> im not very familier with fiddler though
[10:42:09] <toddmparker> me neither
[10:59:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker: commented
[10:59:17] <arschmitz> heading to lunch be back in about an hour
[11:06:33] <toddmparker> ok
[11:06:58] <toddmparker> was just saying to scott_gonzalez that we should start arming up planning for 1.4
[11:07:07] <toddmparker> now that 1.3 is pretty much done
[11:08:11] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez - we added a wiki page to start collecting a bunch of things we'd like to look at doing. It's very incomplete. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-planning
[11:08:28] <toddmparker> think you were helping put together this list too - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Widget-Review
[11:09:25] <toddmparker> please feel free to start adding your list of improvements, pet peeves, consistency issues, etc. to that first wiki page
[11:09:43] <toddmparker> figure we can use that as agenda items when we do a hangout 
[11:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> Based on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Widget-Review I think you're going to want to setup the widget factory meeting before anything else.
[11:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> This whole non-orthogonal options is a solved problem.
[11:13:56] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: absolutely. that is a big item.
[11:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> Parsing data attributes in refresh() sounds crazy.
[11:15:18] <toddmparker> I think there is a lot of widget factory knowledge that you can walk folks through
[11:15:37] <toddmparker> be good to line up and leverage what we already have there
[11:16:20] <toddmparker> not sure who put that wiki page together, thought you might have been involved.
[11:16:39] <toddmparker> so i agree, that would be a great first step
[11:16:48] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't even know the page existed.
[11:16:56] <toddmparker> ah, i see
[11:17:24] <toddmparker> arschmitz pointed me to it a few days ago so i linked it up
[11:17:40] <toddmparker> he'll be back in a bit and we can get some background there
[11:19:13] <Wilto> johnbender: As the “Curator of Code,” I get first say in all matters code. Though I am trememdously frightened of maths, as you know.
[11:19:18] <Wilto> All of the maths. Each of them.
[11:19:27] <Wilto> Individually and in concert.

[11:43:59] <johnbender> toddmparker: agcolom: if you pull the nav-docs branch my examples page is under /docs/demos/navigation/
[11:44:13] <johnbender> let me know if that page works for you guys
[11:47:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker: it looks like there's a pretty good chance I'll be able to come to PDX
[11:48:09] <johnbender> I was thinking of submitting a talk too
[11:48:13] <johnbender> just have to figure out what
[11:48:20] <johnbender> maybe something on the nav in jqm
[11:48:41] <toddmparker> cool
[11:48:51] <toddmparker> be good to really cover nav in-depth
[11:54:31] <agcolom> johnbender: will I be able to view it using http://jquerymobile.com/branches/nav-docs/ or do I need to do a fetch and rebase? (I'm not sure I have a local setup for this repo)
[11:55:34] <toddmparker> johnbender: that page looks great
[11:55:47] <toddmparker> i'd like to simply add that as a widget
[11:56:06] <toddmparker> so that folder would go under /widgets/ not /demos/
[11:56:12] <toddmparker> and we can link it up
[11:56:32] <toddmparker> i like having a page and a nav widget so it' clear that it's separate
[11:56:48] <toddmparker> agcolom: yeah, if you do a pull you should see the branch
[11:56:55] <toddmparker> took a minute to pop up for me
[11:57:31] <agcolom> is it ok to do git pull --rebase? 
[11:57:44] <johnbender> toddmparker: nav isn't a widget though
[11:58:00] <johnbender> unless that's just the directory structure
[11:58:45] <agcolom> or checkout master, git fetch origin, git rebase? (I'm totally rusty on this repo!) I need to find my notes again!!!!
[12:04:47] <toddmparker> johnbender: yeah, it's more of a convention
[12:05:24] <toddmparker> "widgets" are the pure list of plugins with simple examples and a link to the API site
[12:05:37] <toddmparker> "demos" are customized examples 
[12:05:57] <toddmparker> so that page fits nicely in the widget convention
[12:06:58] <johnbender> agcolom: you can do a git fecth
[12:06:58] <johnbender> then
[12:06:59] <johnbender> `git branch -t nav-docs origin:nav-docs`
[12:06:59] <johnbender> err
[12:06:59] <johnbender> `git fetch origin`
[12:06:59] <johnbender> `git branch -t nav-docs origin:nav-docs`
[12:06:59] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'll move it down the directory structure after lunch
[12:08:49] <toddmparker> cool. like it a lot. thanks johnbender 
[12:09:07] <agcolom> thank you johnbender.
[12:10:11] <agcolom> I just remembered... I need to do git fetch upstream
[12:11:18] <johnbender> agcolom: toddmparker: alright, I'll move the dir and merge then
[12:11:26] <johnbender> agcolom: sorry :(
[12:12:08] <agcolom> np. I have my notes somewhere... I must find them.
[12:13:08] <agcolom> ah.... my partner took my notebook to work! My notes are there.... on his desk....

[12:28:32] <agcolom> johnbender: beautiful and very clear! Brilliant! Thank you! 
[12:29:30] <agcolom> I have spotted one tiny typo (exmaple instead of example under the Event Example section)
[12:31:21] <toddmparker> nice, right?
[12:31:21] <agcolom> not sure whether you want to change it yourself or you want me to do it (I'm happy to do it if that's easier for you)
[12:31:30] <agcolom> yes, really good! 
[12:33:53] <arschmitz> toddmparker: im back
[12:34:11] <arschmitz> saw something you and scott_gonzalez had a question about?
[12:34:44] <arschmitz> johnbender: awesome you will make it. I was also thinking of submitting a talk not sure about what yet though
[12:34:59] <arschmitz> maybe the mobile widget factory 
[12:35:23] <arschmitz> and how it differes and proper design pattern / initalization for mobile
[12:36:19] <toddmparker> arschmitz: hey
[12:36:32] <toddmparker> was talking to scott_gonzalez about how we should start planning 1.4
[12:36:38] <arschmitz> ok
[12:36:48] <toddmparker> think we all agree that step 1 is to review the widget factory conventions
[12:37:02] <toddmparker> and outline a set of standards to apply to all the code
[12:37:34] <toddmparker> i pointed him to that wiki page you showed me and he said there are much saner ways of doing things built into the widget factory
[12:38:34] <arschmitz> yeah that item about the data-attributes is old _|Nix|_ had added that
[12:38:45] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[12:39:05] <arschmitz> last i talked to him about that we both had said that it makes no sense to check data-attributes
[12:39:20] <arschmitz> those are inital config
[12:39:30] <toddmparker> be good to have you maybe take point on coordinating with scott_gonzalez on harmonizing the widget factory and API stuff if you're game
[12:39:43] <arschmitz> absolutely
[12:39:52] <toddmparker> we will all need to work on it but this needs someone to drive it forward and work closely with scott_gonzalez 
[12:40:03] <arschmitz> yeah id love to do that
[12:40:04] <toddmparker> think you'd be the best choice so that's great
[12:40:23] <toddmparker> he's not here now, but try to track him down
[12:40:33] <arschmitz> its a big project it will take every one to get through it in a reasonably amount of time
[12:40:38] <toddmparker> for sure
[12:40:58] <arschmitz> the number of widgets we have is constantly growing
[12:41:01] <toddmparker> but if you and scott_gonzalez can help to hash out the goals and standards, we can divvy up the actual work
[12:41:14] <arschmitz> yeah sounds good
[12:41:14] <toddmparker> like you said, we want a clear game plan before we touch the code
[12:41:20] <arschmitz> yup
[12:41:47] <toddmparker> the question of core js is another topic
[12:41:56] <arschmitz> yeah 
[12:42:07] <arschmitz> thats a bigger and seperate thing
[12:42:11] <toddmparker> general goal is that people could use widgets form either library and not incur much/any overhead
[12:42:19] <arschmitz> yup
[12:42:25] <arschmitz> cut down to a common core
[12:42:28] <toddmparker> yeah. many facets too - theme framework, auto init, etc.
[12:42:32] <toddmparker> yeah
[12:42:44] <toddmparker> ideally, same core
[12:42:57] <arschmitz> i think to do that right themeing is the big thing
[12:42:59] <toddmparker> our autoinit stuff could be a plugin
[12:43:05] <toddmparker> theming is hard
[12:43:18] <toddmparker> but scott_gonzalez has an idea for a class config option that should help there too
[12:43:20] <arschmitz> to cut down to a common core with extensions isnt really that hard just takes a joint effort
[12:43:39] <toddmparker> i want to first streamline our css framework,then figure out how to plug it into UI anyway
[12:43:40] <arschmitz> themeing really has to be unified though
[12:43:47] <toddmparker> yep
[12:44:11] <toddmparker> think UI wants to allow people to use either theme framework "classic ui" or "next (mobile)"
[12:44:12] <arschmitz> the best situation would be to adopt a common theme framework use the same theme roller
[12:44:30] <arschmitz> thats a cool idea
[12:44:32] <toddmparker> yeah, that is the goal. want to really push on that for 1.4
[12:44:49] <arschmitz> makes since because im sure they will want to change the themeing
[12:44:53] <arschmitz> to some extent
[12:45:12] <arschmitz> it wont be just ours or just theres but something in between
[12:45:50] <toddmparker> right
[12:46:09] <toddmparker> but we want o avoid making people load two themes if they want to use widgets from both
[12:46:17] <arschmitz> right
[12:46:34] <toddmparker> ideally, we will keep these projects separate because they serve different audiences atm
[12:46:53] <toddmparker> but under the covers, be nice to share as much code, conventions, theming, etc. as we can
[12:46:54] <arschmitz> right but to use a commong themeing makes sense
[12:47:00] <toddmparker> tools like download and TR
[12:47:07] <arschmitz> yup
[12:47:43] <arschmitz> i think it makes sense and there are some things that work awesome together already that you wouldnt guess
[12:48:16] <toddmparker> jzaefferer and scott_gonzalez will be the right people to huddle on this stuff with on UI's side
[12:48:36] <arschmitz> like tabs to make it look 100% mobile and work perfect in mobile is on the wrapper ul it uses for the tabs make it a nav bar
[12:48:41] <toddmparker> we've been heads down, but from now on, the more we can collaborate and even move between the projects, the better
[12:48:43] <arschmitz> and then use body classes on the divs
[12:48:47] <toddmparker> right
[12:49:06] <toddmparker> that's why i wanted to use tabs as a test case. a lot will shake out as part of that
[12:49:35] <arschmitz> yeah as soon as scott_gonzalez: is around ill talk to him about how he wants to procede 
[12:49:41] <toddmparker> sweet
[12:49:52] <toddmparker> we can set up times for larger meetings and such
[12:50:09] <arschmitz> hes deffintly got the knowledge and experience i think he will know the best way for us to get started
[12:50:13] <toddmparker> but i think most of the good work will happen here more casually if you guys can keep in close contact
[12:50:28] <arschmitz> yup
[12:50:28] <toddmparker> yeah, the widget factory is his baby and it's really powerful stuff
[12:50:40] <arschmitz> yeah im a huge fan of the widget factory
[12:50:57] <arschmitz> iv written TONS of widgets that use it over the last few years
[12:51:03] <toddmparker> i know, that's why you're a good person to take point here
[12:51:09] <arschmitz> and read like everything i could find on it
[12:51:13] <arschmitz> lol
[12:51:22] <toddmparker> great. sure you'll learn even more from the master
[12:51:30] <toddmparker> great, feel good about this
[12:51:30] <arschmitz> yeah i hope so
[12:51:52] <arschmitz> cool im excited
[12:52:00] <toddmparker> encourage scott_gonzalez to get it all out there. let's make things as right as possible
[12:52:10] <arschmitz> for sure
[12:52:27] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and i will probably be taking point on the css/theme framework side of things
[12:52:42] <arschmitz> makes sense he is great at css
[12:52:44] <toddmparker> those are the two big parts of this that need to mesh up
[12:52:47] <toddmparker> yeah
[12:53:12] <toddmparker> when the time comes, we can get the manpower to get all the code whipped into shape.
[12:53:22] <arschmitz> yup
[12:53:37] <arschmitz> this really requires a lot of inital planning to get it right 
[12:53:37] <toddmparker> for tabs, it'll be interesting to see if we could literally share the same plugin code
[12:53:46] <toddmparker> right
[12:53:47] <arschmitz> on both sides
[12:54:14] <toddmparker> if 1.4 takes a bit longer than 3 months, so be it. i'd rather make this the best library possible, we'll figure out the rest
[12:54:18] <arschmitz> toddmparker: we nearly can already with really really minor changes
[12:54:30] <toddmparker> cool
[12:54:46] <arschmitz> you can just drop tabs right in and use our theme on it not even use ui theme or css at all
[12:57:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i know kborchers: too we were in korea together and talk once in a while on skype so thats at least someone else on their team
[12:58:15] <kborchers> who has woken me from my slumber?!?!
[12:58:21] <arschmitz> ha ha
[12:58:24] <arschmitz> hey
[12:59:22] <arschmitz> kborchers: toddmparker and i were talking about me working with scott_gonzalez on some stuff
[12:59:37] <arschmitz> kborchers: and i was just saying i knew you too
[12:59:49] <kborchers> ah i see
[13:00:13] <arschmitz> kborchers: how have you been?
[13:00:17] <toddmparker> quick hide, it's kborchers 
[13:00:23] <kborchers> well feel free to ping me with questions too though this week is bad as i'm traveling for work and in meetings all week
[13:00:27] <toddmparker> dammit, do not engage
[13:00:34] <toddmparker> thanks kborchers 
[13:00:38] <kborchers> arschmitz: good, you?
[13:00:38] <toddmparker> sure we will
[13:00:41] <kborchers> toddmparker: :)
[13:00:59] <arschmitz> kborchers: great getting REALLY close to the due date
[13:02:34] <kborchers> arschmitz: oh! nice!
[13:02:40] <toddmparker> when's the big day
[13:02:54] <arschmitz> march 10th is the due date
[13:03:02] <arschmitz> so really it could be almost any time now
[13:03:18] <toddmparker> ticking timebomb
[13:03:31] <arschmitz> lol yup
[13:03:45] <Wilto> Someone call for a “ticking timebomb?”

[13:29:34] <arschmitz> toddmparker: you still around?
[13:29:44] <toddmparker> heck yeah
[13:33:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker:http://jsbin.com/uzaret/676/edit
[13:33:11] <toddmparker> arschmitz ^
[13:33:29] <toddmparker> what's that?
[13:33:43] <toddmparker> ah, tabs
[13:33:48] <arschmitz> thats ui's tabs all i have changed is added the init selector and made it extend the mobile widget factory
[13:34:14] <toddmparker> cool
[13:34:33] <arschmitz> yeah tabs really need essentially nothing
[13:34:39] <toddmparker> good idea to hack on this to see what it will take
[13:34:45] <toddmparker> nice to hear that
[13:35:02] <arschmitz> yeah only two lines are changed
[13:35:07] <arschmitz> and im not using the ui core
[13:35:14] <toddmparker> no?
[13:35:18] <arschmitz> nope
[13:35:20] <toddmparker> and it works, huh
[13:35:29] <arschmitz> oh i did take their unique id funtion
[13:35:40] <arschmitz> because we dont have a uniqueid function
[13:35:46] <toddmparker> just remembered their tabs has an ajax option so we'd need to handle the create stuff when we pull in content
[13:35:53] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:36:05] <arschmitz> this is just for basic tabs
[13:36:11] <arschmitz> no ajax
[13:36:21] <toddmparker> good example to see what would be a good common core and what would just be dependencies
[13:36:46] <toddmparker> bet if you tossed in their structure.css, it would be functional
[13:36:50] <arschmitz> though i made the tab links data-ajax="false" so i think ajaxing a tab would still work lol
[13:37:00] <arschmitz> it is functional on chrome anyway?
[13:37:27] <arschmitz> it should tab between the regular js bin a list and just some text?
[13:38:44] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/678/edit
[13:38:50] <toddmparker> just simplified markup to see what's up
[13:39:13] <toddmparker> typo
[13:39:13] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/679/edit
[13:39:30] <arschmitz> cool
[13:39:35] <arschmitz> is it not working for you?
[13:39:54] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/680/edit
[13:39:56] <toddmparker> nope
[13:40:01] <toddmparker> i see all the tab contents
[13:40:25] <arschmitz> weird
[13:40:30] <arschmitz> it works fine for me
[13:40:36] <arschmitz> your on chrome?
[13:40:40] <toddmparker> yep
[13:41:03] <arschmitz> him im on 25 windows 7 let me pull out the laptop
[13:41:57] <arschmitz> crazy works fine for me on osX too
[13:41:58] <toddmparker> ooooh
[13:42:00] <toddmparker> it works!
[13:42:05] <arschmitz> lol
[13:42:07] <toddmparker> didn't have the auto-run js
[13:42:09] <toddmparker> der
[13:42:11] <arschmitz> ha ha
[13:42:21] <toddmparker> operator error
[13:42:24] <toddmparker> looks great
[13:42:27] <arschmitz> lol i was wondering lol
[13:42:27] <toddmparker> you using a navbar?
[13:42:30] <arschmitz> yup
[13:42:36] <toddmparker> perfect
[13:42:40] <arschmitz> i love navbar for tabs so perfectly mobile lol
[13:42:57] <arschmitz> for real though no core and only changed 2 lines of the widget
[13:43:11] <toddmparker> amazing
[13:43:23] <toddmparker> did we just get lucky with tabs?
[13:43:33] <arschmitz> partially 
[13:43:50] <arschmitz> in that it does not really require much for css
[13:44:10] <toddmparker> looks nice
[13:44:11] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/682/edit
[13:44:29] <arschmitz> yup works great for lists too
[13:44:35] <arschmitz> toss a list in one of the tabs
[13:45:03] <arschmitz> thats even being auto initalized by data-role ="tabs"
[13:45:37] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/683/edit
[13:45:38] <toddmparker> cool
[13:45:46] <toddmparker> heh
[13:45:57] <toddmparker> we're done then :)
[13:46:03] <arschmitz> tabs is like a slam dunk already ha ha
[13:46:09] <toddmparker> gotta set the active state on init
[13:46:15] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:46:32] <arschmitz> would be good to ad a 3 line extension to _create
[13:46:33] <toddmparker> be cool to be smart and switch to a select if the tab labels don't' fit
[13:46:36] <toddmparker> or an accordion
[13:46:54] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:47:01] <toddmparker> maybe we can do a few rough ports of widgets to get a sense of things
[13:47:10] <toddmparker> helps the conversation
[13:47:27] <toddmparker> tabs are nice because they have such simple appearance
[13:47:31] <arschmitz> most of them work but css / theme is the real issue
[13:47:48] <toddmparker> an inset style would be cool for this too
[13:47:53] <toddmparker> yeah
[13:47:56] <arschmitz> yup
[13:48:06] <toddmparker> in theory, the structural css should be fine
[13:48:13] <arschmitz> yup
[13:48:16] <toddmparker> the theme just defines colors
[13:48:21] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:48:27] <toddmparker> but i think we have different core.css
[13:48:32] <toddmparker> so that needs looking at
[13:48:47] <arschmitz> yeah the css has pretty big conflicts last i checked
[13:48:56] <toddmparker> ui- namespace
[13:49:02] <toddmparker> wish we didn't do that
[13:49:07] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:49:31] <toddmparker> not sure how to fix that easily
[13:50:25] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:50:41] <arschmitz> something is going to break lol
[13:51:54] <arschmitz> thats going to be a lot of work to harmonize the css
[13:52:11] <arschmitz> i think more then for the js lol
[13:56:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker: hmm now im tempted to try and port their slider
[13:56:25] <toddmparker> datepicker…argh!
[13:56:40] <arschmitz> datepicker is serious trouble ha ha
[13:56:53] <toddmparker> yeah, they are going to re-factor that soon anyway
[13:57:02] <toddmparker> their slider doesn't work with touch
[13:57:13] <arschmitz> it has a FOLDER of dependencies for i18n lol
[13:57:28] <toddmparker> you can swap out languages
[13:58:50] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:58:57] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/2xn4Wg
[13:58:57] <arschmitz> just so much going on with date picker
[13:58:58] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 146693e14 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: added entries for page transition events
[13:59:28] <arschmitz> i think im going to fork ui and work on porting a few widgets like you said
[14:02:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ajax tabs still works fine! http://jsbin.com/uzaret/684/edit
[14:03:13] <arschmitz> :)
[14:03:32] <toddmparker> cool
[14:03:46] <toddmparker> so it's just the enhancement stuff that's needed
[14:03:47] <arschmitz> tab 3 loads ajax content
[14:03:51] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:04:03] <arschmitz> you would have to call create 
[14:04:16] <arschmitz> but thats literally a 1 line extension
[14:04:17] <toddmparker> nabbers kill the key handling and such
[14:04:20] <toddmparker> right
[14:04:25] <toddmparker> navbars
[14:04:41] <toddmparker> so i guess we'd style 'em like nabbers but not use navbar
[14:04:51] <toddmparker> so the accessibility stuff would be the same
[14:04:57] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:11:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i got it down to only one changed line which is simply making it extend mobile base widget
[14:17:00] <kborchers> arschmitz: toddmparker when are you thinking 1.3.0 will be out? Loving the table stuff. I basically implemented that by hand for an app a while back and this is way better :) Also the panels are hot!
[14:17:16] <arschmitz> kborchers: rc came out today
[14:17:21] <kborchers> yeah, saw that :)
[14:17:22] <arschmitz> final probably next week
[14:17:25] <kborchers> nice
[14:19:32] <arschmitz> table stuff is nice
[14:19:40] <arschmitz> panels are good too
[14:52:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker: so i ported the tabs with out modifing it at all
[14:52:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/685/edit
[14:54:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks like we have first new widget for 1.4 ready ;-)
[14:54:59] <arschmitz> lol
[14:55:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not even using the ui core thats pure mobile just dropping in tabs js
[14:55:45] <uGoMobi> nice
[14:55:54] <arschmitz> ajax tabs even still work
[14:56:03] <arschmitz> its crazy how easy it was
[15:00:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toddmparker: egads! our jsbin test page does not work in firefox http://jsbin.com/uzaret/1/edit
[15:02:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: or http://jsbin.com/onibuc/1/edit
[15:02:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: preview mode works
[15:02:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this is a known problem
[15:03:01] <arschmitz> oh ok
[15:03:03] <uGoMobi> I remember agcolom mentioned it months ago
[15:03:08] <arschmitz> apparently i missed that 
[15:03:40] <arschmitz> its something with replace state it looks like probably crossdomain bs from the frame maybe
[15:04:01] <arschmitz> its not cross domain though but anyway cool enough works in preview and its known
[15:04:46] <arschmitz> well im heading home ill check back in in a while
[15:05:58] <toddmparker> stupid ff
[15:06:09] <arschmitz> yeah
[15:06:28] <arschmitz> toddmparker: did you see i got tabs with out core and with out any changes?
[15:09:55] <toddmparker> yeah?
[15:10:06] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/685/edit
[15:10:23] <arschmitz> it uses the raw gitub of the ui tabs widget
[15:10:57] <toddmparker> impressive
[15:11:10] <toddmparker> so this might not be as bad as we thought
[15:11:34] <arschmitz> nope
[15:12:20] <arschmitz> gota run though ill pop back in later
