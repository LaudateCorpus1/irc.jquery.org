[11:12:18] <jq-jenkins> john.m.bender: add suites back in that were removed for debugging at some point
[11:38:01] <kborchers> hey guys just fyi looks like minified latest is broken http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js ... not a big deal to just switch to full for my dev stuff but thought you would want to know
[12:01:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #1,449: STILL FAILING in 28 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/1449/
[12:01:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> john.m.bender: add suites back in that were removed for debugging at some point
[12:07:36] <toddparker> jeep. looks like something is busted on the build
[12:07:38] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3964
[12:07:39] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3964 on jquery-mobile (mtamony; 18m, 58s ago): http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js is gone
[12:07:48] <toddparker> johnbender or gseguin ^^
[12:08:25] <toddparker> this one is ok: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js
[12:08:38] <toddparker> min js is empty: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js
[12:17:43] <johnbender> toddparker: that's odd, it should never disapear
[12:17:55] <johnbender> oh
[12:17:57] <johnbender> it's not gone
[12:18:01] <johnbender> it's just crap
[12:18:05] <johnbender> sigh
[12:18:08] <johnbender> gdamn broken builds
[12:18:15] <toddparker> bah
[12:18:36] <johnbender> the server ugh
[12:22:38] <toddparker> what happened?
[12:26:10] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #1,500: STILL FAILING in 31 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/1500/
[12:27:24] <johnbender> toddparker: dunno but since about 9am yesterday it's totally hit or miss
[12:27:28] <johnbender> something changed and I don't know what
[12:27:36] <johnbender> I haven't gotten a response from either danheberden or jzaefferer
[12:27:45] <johnbender> I'm going to post to the infra google group
[12:33:01] <toddparker> ok
[12:33:18] <toddparker> odd thing is the css is ok
[12:33:22] <toddparker> just the js
[12:33:35] <johnbender> toddparker: the might make it through
[12:33:44] <johnbender> it's entirely dependent on when the process chooses to fail
[12:33:56] <johnbender> *the css might make it through
[12:40:46] <johnbender> toddparker: posted
[12:42:11] <johnbender> toddparker: what's odd is that it shouldn't push the broken css if the build steps that produce it fail
[12:42:17] <johnbender> not at all sure how that happened
[12:51:41] <tbenzige> toddparker: ping
[13:01:54] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[13:01:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #1,450: FIXED in 28 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/1450/
[13:02:00] <johnbender> by pure luck
[13:02:18] <johnbender> hmm
[13:02:28] <johnbender> gah
[13:02:32] <johnbender> build's confused
[13:04:11] <johnbender> toddparker: it might be good to tweet about that issue, I'm now officially worried that people are using it in production or development environments from the CDN
[13:04:17] <johnbender> given how quick that issue came in
[13:04:33] <johnbender> you can link to the github issue and I'll post there for updates
[13:04:46] <Wilto> Dammit, internet.
[13:30:17] <toddparker> sure
[13:31:48] <toddparker> tweeted, tho the bot didn't seem to pick it up
[13:32:13] <toddparker> johnbender: one more thing…been starting to hear that 1.7.2 is causing issues with 1.1rc
[13:32:33] <toddparker> wonder if we should plan on supporting that soon
[13:32:41] <toddparker> dunno what changed in .2
[13:48:08] <johnbender> toddparker: ugh
[13:48:19] <johnbender> toddparker: well with the href monkeying we were doing
[13:48:23] <johnbender> we might not have much of a choice
[13:48:26] <johnbender> though I think we should remove that
[13:48:38] <johnbender> the addressbar is not that important
[13:48:55] <johnbender> toddparker: also, I sent out another email - I think I've identified the issue at least in part
[13:49:25] <johnbender> the apache install is the base prefork setup (ie it forks a new process for each request) which is super memory hungry
[13:49:42] <johnbender> hopefully someone will chime in with an opinion soon
[13:49:56] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[13:49:56] <johnbender> there's just so much on the server that I don't want to make changes because of all the things it might affect
[13:49:57] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #1,501: FIXED in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/1501/
[13:50:56] <johnbender> ugh
[13:51:04] <johnbender> that was a faux success
[13:51:11] <johnbender> the build still didn't make it through
[13:51:31] <johnbender> danheberden: seriously need some input from the rest of the infra team
[13:53:56] <Wilto> Fauxess.
[13:54:07] <Wilto> Oh, JSConf. _Right_.
[14:00:45] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Have you looked into grunt yet?
[14:02:58] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I have
[14:03:00] <johnbender> I even got started
[14:03:08] <johnbender> but I've got other things in the way right now
[14:03:14] <Wilto> Gonna spend some quality time with Grunt soon m’self.
[14:03:34] <Wilto> …God, nothing about that sentence is appealing out of context.
[14:03:36] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: there's a branch were I've started migrating everything out of the makefile into bash scripts
[14:03:39] <johnbender> just the first step
[14:03:42] <johnbender> but it's started
[14:04:39] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: are you asking with regards to the build issues?
[14:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> No, core and UI are pretty much done, I hadn't heard anything from Mobile.
[14:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> The doc says you haven't started yet.
[14:05:33] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: ah, yah I forgot to update it
[14:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> Cool, could you just add details about what's complete/todo?
[14:06:29] <johnbender> sure
[14:08:45] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: updated
[14:09:07] <johnbender> I just included the high level migration path
[14:09:14] <johnbender> there's obviously a lot of detail in the last one too
[14:09:16] <johnbender> but that's the plan
[14:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> Can you remove the bash portion?
[14:11:02] <johnbender> ?
[14:11:17] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: what do you mean
[14:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> Bash doesnt' run on Windows without cygwin, does it?
[14:11:35] <johnbender> correct, hopefull we won't need the bash at some point
[14:11:53] <johnbender> but we do a lot of file alterations and things that will take some work to port
[14:12:34] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I've added that as the last migration step
[14:12:48] <johnbender> that's probably the bulk of the work
[14:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> CSS min, linting, require should all be pretty easy.
[14:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> JS lint is built in, jzaefferer created a grunt plugin for css min + css lint
[14:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> require is already in node.
[14:15:46] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: if we break those bits out of the parent js, css targets then at least some subset of the build could be run pretty quickly on windows
[14:16:39] <johnbender> I'll make sure that's part of the process
[14:24:42] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[14:24:47] <johnbender> just do you're aware
[14:24:52] <johnbender> *so
[14:45:48] <toddparker> johnbender: latest seems ok again - http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js
[14:46:10] <johnbender> toddparker: alright maybe I should pause that build until we get the issues sorted out?
[15:09:10] <johnbender> toddparker: pausing until I hear otherwise
[15:10:48] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: gseguin: kinblas: the built to keep latest up to date is disabled
[15:11:20] <johnbender> I'm thinkin we can re-enable it after I sort out why it's replacing files with half built assets on the cdn :(
[15:22:51] <toddparker> ok
[15:22:58] <toddparker> does this effect /test/
[15:23:03] <toddparker> or just the CDN
[15:23:06] <johnbender> toddparker: yes
[15:23:15] <johnbender> that's why I'm mentioning it
[15:23:16] <toddparker> it does
[15:23:18] <toddparker> ok
[15:23:28] <toddparker> i'm doing final testing for rc2
[15:23:33] <toddparker> so i'll just run it locally
[15:23:34] <johnbender> kk
[15:26:01] <johnbender> toddparker: well for whatever reason there's less memory being taken up by httpd now so I'm assuming that's why the build went through
[15:26:08] <johnbender> I'm gong to re-enable it and see what happens
[15:30:10] <johnbender> toddparker: good ol' apache was just chewing up memory
[15:30:15] <johnbender> build just went through
[15:30:28] <johnbender> sadly we don't have much overhead on that box for that sort of thing
[15:31:38] <toddparker> i see
[15:31:51] <toddparker> so is it back now, but we never know when it will crap out?
[15:32:03] <johnbender> toddparker: yah something like that
[15:32:13] <toddparker> 1hmm
[15:32:14] <toddparker> ok
[15:32:22] <johnbender> we could add something like monit to manage the memory use but that requires memory too
[15:32:31] <toddparker> well, i'm heading out but will be working on finishing up the draft of the blog post for rc2
[15:32:35] <johnbender> as far as I know some new servers are in the works
[15:32:39] <johnbender> toddparker: cool
[15:32:39] <toddparker> very circular
[15:32:48] <toddparker> i think things feel pretty good
[15:33:05] <toddparker> that PG issue we were looking at might not be solvable
[15:33:11] <johnbender> yah
[15:33:17] <johnbender> seems like things are doing ok
[15:33:18] <toddparker> so i think all the key issues are patched up
[15:33:31] <toddparker> look around and see if you see any blockers
[15:33:53] <toddparker> if you have time to browse around and test on your devices tonight, i'd appreciate it
[15:34:10] <toddparker> hoping to be ready to pull the trigger either tomorrow or friday at the latest
[15:34:20] <toddparker> k, g'night
[16:23:08] <johnbender> heading home
[16:23:20] <johnbender> I'll be back on when I get there
[16:47:39] <LakWork> I found a bug on the website, under your a-grade browser list:  "Firebox Mobile (10 Beta) – Tested on Android 2.3 device"
[16:47:54] <LakWork> Fire*F*ox
