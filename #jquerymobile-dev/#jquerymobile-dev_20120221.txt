[08:37:09] <jq-jenkins> scott: continued to work on this event docs page, which is still very unfinished.
[09:11:18] <johnbender> Wilto: are you looking into that collapsible bug?
[09:12:44] <johnbender> Wilto: collapsible set's appear to be behaving oddly too
[09:12:47] <johnbender> Wilto: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-set.html
[09:27:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright I'm going to do the docs for data-enhance false
[09:37:00] <gseguin> morning all
[09:37:07] <gseguin> sorry guys I was off yesterday
[09:37:23] <gseguin> I'll look at that thing tomorrow
[09:37:43] <gseguin> johnbender: that commit message does not match the change, indeed
[09:37:59] <gseguin> I wonder if I messed up with my IDE when commiting
[09:43:30] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hey! Could you please have a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3604? If you recall, you added code that prevents double enhancement by buttonMarkup, whereas I contributed some code which allows correct subsequent re-enhancement when buttonMarkup is called again with an already-enhanced element.
[09:44:02] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The PR removes the filter that you added, because the code below it now correctly handles multiple calls with the same element.
[09:53:14] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: oh I thought that landed already
[09:53:20] <toddmparker_> thanks johnbender
[09:53:24] <gseguin> I'll land it
[09:53:31] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Thanks!
[09:58:34] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto said that it might not matter so I would confer with him first before doing anything
[09:58:57] <gseguin> johnbender: ok

[10:00:22] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: no, thank you!
[10:02:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I added docs to data-attributes, globalconfig, and methds all under the api subdir

[10:07:55] <toddmparker_> cool. i'll give it a read through
[10:08:07] * johnbender is a poor writer
[10:15:57] <Wilto> Hi what I’m wilto hello.
[10:17:00] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, gseguin I wouldn’t mind having your eyes on that collapsibleset issue.
[10:18:41] <johnbender> Wilto: did you see my earlier link too
[10:18:43] <johnbender> ?
[10:19:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to close that issue and move onto the data-ajax false containers
[10:19:25] <Wilto> johnbender: To the collapsible sets’ page?
[10:21:50] <johnbender> Wilto: yah, it might just be me but the first example looks broken
[10:22:26] <Wilto> johnbender: Seems okay from here. Chrome?
[10:26:28] <gseguin> Wilto: that's https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3529 , right?
[10:26:43] <Wilto> gseguin: Yessir.
[10:26:58] <gseguin> yep it's on my todo list for wed

[10:28:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] corrected docs to reflect revert to /js/ - John Bender
[10:28:06] <johnbender> Wilto: the first set of collapsibles should show 5 here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-set.html
[10:28:09] <johnbender> right?
[10:29:36] <Wilto> I got five grouped-up here, johnbender.
[10:30:07] <johnbender> hmm
[10:30:08] <johnbender> wtf
[10:30:12] <johnbender> I'm looking at it in chrome too
[10:30:22] <Wilto> I mean, the first one starts open, is all. Screenshot me?

[10:30:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] quick clarification on the amd include example - John Bender
[10:30:33] <johnbender> Wilto: zomg
[10:30:36] <johnbender> I'm retarded
[10:30:47] <Wilto> I mentioned that only because I did the _exact same thing_, sir.
[10:30:50] <johnbender> the fact that there isn't any styling between the headers and content
[10:31:06] <johnbender> totally confused my eye
[10:31:08] * johnbender is ashamed
[10:31:13] * johnbender crawls back into his cave
[10:40:21] <Wilto> Hey, I did it too—and styling things is pretty much all I can do.
[10:41:38] <Wilto> Speaking of: thanks for handling that, gseguin!
[10:42:12] <gseguin> Wilto: huh?
[10:42:23] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3529
[10:42:32] <gseguin> oh ok
[10:42:38] <Wilto> High-fives for all.
[10:42:38] <gseguin> yeah no problem
[12:20:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: Wilto: waiting to hear back from kin but has anyone started namespacing event attributes
[12:20:57] <johnbender> I get a crazy sense of dejavu when I think about it
[12:21:04] <johnbender> $.Event.prototype.mobile
[12:21:13] <johnbender> $.Event.prototype.mobile = {};
[12:21:17] <johnbender> in core
[12:22:59] <johnbender> like `event.orientation`
[12:29:53] <johnbender> in that case we could provide both and then deprecate `event.orientation`
[12:50:42] <Wilto> Who is PSYCHED UP FOR BLACKBERRY CALLS AW YISS I’ve had some cold medicine today yes what of it.
[13:03:17] <gseguin> anybody there?
[13:11:51] <gseguin> johnbender: are you joining the meeting
[13:11:54] <gseguin> ?
[13:26:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think there may still be a problem with buttonMarkup: the commit just before your merge of my PR no longer has $workingSet = $.mobile.enhanceable(this);
[13:26:38] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, the declaration at the top of buttonMarkup should be $workingSet = this;
[13:26:39] <gseguin> does that need to go as well ?
[13:26:48] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think so.
[13:26:53] <gseguin> arrrgh, sorry
[13:27:07] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[13:27:31] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: My PR was no longer applyuuuuuuing cleanly, and that was the conflict.
[13:27:41] <_|Nix|_> Eeek! What was that ... O_o
[13:28:06] <gseguin> yep
[13:28:39] <gseguin> mind creating a PR ?
[13:28:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Not at all.
[13:29:05] <gseguin> alright, I'll land it right away
[13:35:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3621/
[13:35:58] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (40.468s ago): [buttonMarkup] $.mobile.enhanceable is no longer being called
[13:36:37] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: self is not used?
[13:37:03] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Nope. It was only used in your filter.
[13:37:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ^ sorry about that
[13:37:17] <johnbender> I made the switch late last week
[13:37:21] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: heh :)
[13:37:23] <johnbender> good eye htough
[13:37:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Lucky that I tried to merge master into my branch just as gseguin was merging the PR based on that very branch.
