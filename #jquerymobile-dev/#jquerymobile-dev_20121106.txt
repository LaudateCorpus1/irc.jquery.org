[05:01:25] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_
[05:03:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in your video that is because they are all last child's each radio has its own wrapper div .ui-radio with an input and label the label is .ui-btn and is last so all of them are the last chiled
[05:04:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but the corners work.
[05:05:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, but it's inherit, so that's why they work.
[05:05:32] <arschmitz> yeah its not an actual value
[05:06:50] <_|Nix|_> So much for my na√Øve attempt to fix the bttom-border problem.
[05:07:09] <arschmitz> Nice with the diff stats though that cuts some pretty good code!
[05:07:17] <_|Nix|_> I know, eh?
[05:07:42] <_|Nix|_> Can't wait to start slicing and dicing through collapsible. I've already picked out some juicy tidbits.
[05:08:02] <arschmitz> nice
[05:08:08] <_|Nix|_> Just waiting for uGoMobi to get back from his appointment and start stylin' things up.
[05:08:45] <_|Nix|_> Fixing the unit tests will be another thing though ... I bet lots of tests expect classes to be present that are no longer present.
[05:09:16] <arschmitz> hey if i follow what your trying to do in your video right couldnt you do .ui-controlgroup-vertical .ui-radio:last-child .ui-btn ?
[05:09:53] <arschmitz> then its the .ui-btn in the last radio?
[05:14:20] <_|Nix|_> I can try that. Either way, the goal is to get the bottom border to be present.
[05:16:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and good morning to you too :)
[05:16:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ha ha All business up in here this morning :)

[10:12:21] <arschmitz> hi gnarf
[10:12:38] <gnarf> can you guys take a look at see ?12497 and see if someone can get a solid repro?  The PR this guy filed for this bug makes NO sense to me

[10:14:36] <gnarf> :)
[10:14:59] <arschmitz> i dont think the filament guys have a 2.3.4 either i think theres is 2.3.6

[11:45:24] <uGoMobi> and buttons in controlgroups shouldn't get ui-shadow
[11:45:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know, I was just thinking that.
[11:45:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we are getting close :)
[11:46:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But then if someone adds a button to the controlgroup, that button will have corners by default.
[11:46:18] <uGoMobi> last things I have to do is the corner styling for header/content/footer in dialogs
[11:46:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: tests/functional/controlgroup.html tests the dynamic addition/removal of buttons.
[11:46:51] <_|Nix|_> It's in the css-corner-styling-js-removal branch.
[11:46:58] <uGoMobi> and the CSS for the border on last items in a group
[11:47:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I am going to take a look at that
[11:47:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We should merge the two branches ...
[11:47:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We'll have fewer merge commits that way.
[11:48:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, wasn't sure in which branch to continue my work
[11:48:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, let's work in your branch.
[11:48:39] <uGoMobi> was thinking about cherry-picking from your branch
[11:49:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono ... that's not the way to go. I'll merge my js changes into your branch.
[11:50:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[11:51:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, when someone dynamically adds a button to a controlgroup which has corners turned on, how do we remove ui-corner-all from the button?
[11:51:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we'll need a refresh() method after all, which just calls .buttonMarkup({corners: false}) on all buttons.
[11:56:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah we might need a refresh() method... controlgroup should simply remove ui-corner-all from all buttons
[11:57:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[11:57:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Same goes for collapsibleSet when you insert a new collapsible.
[11:57:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nope
[11:58:00] <uGoMobi> not needed
[11:58:00] <_|Nix|_> No?
[11:58:05] <_|Nix|_> How come?
[11:58:25] <uGoMobi> I removed all corner stuff from the collapsible and -set JS
[11:58:33] <uGoMobi> all is done with CSS
[11:58:46] <_|Nix|_> So collapsible doesn't have ui-corner-all?
[11:59:04] <uGoMobi> yes, but on the container
[11:59:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK, and when it gets added to the collapsibleSet, the container is stripped away?
[12:00:01] <uGoMobi> I made the individual collapsibles not to get class ui-corner-all if part of a set
[12:00:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But what if I create the collapsible by itself, and then I move it into a collapsibleSet.
[12:00:30] <_|Nix|_> ?
[12:02:12] <_|Nix|_> Why can't we define that ui-corner-all for immediate children of collapsibleSet or controlgroup has no corners, except for :first-child and :last-child, which inherits the top resp. bottom corners?
[12:02:54] <_|Nix|_> That way, we could keep ui-corner-all, and it would have no meaning inside these containers.
[12:02:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah that's possible too
[12:03:11] <uGoMobi> but requires more CSS
[12:03:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That would remove the need for a refresh method.
[12:03:15] <uGoMobi> to negate things
[12:03:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Better CSS than JS.
[12:06:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think appending individual collapsible to collapsible set would be an issue
[12:07:31] <uGoMobi> when you enhance the appended element it checks if it is in a collapsible set
[12:08:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But what if, when you enhance it, it is outside a set, but then the user inserts the already-enhanced collapsible into the set?
[12:08:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: People do the strangest things.
[12:09:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and we still have a problem with enhancement order.
[12:09:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I will look into solving this in a way that a collapsible in a collapsible set can have ui-corner-all without causing issues
[12:10:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we need that kind of override for both controlgroups and collapsibles ...
[12:11:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, I merged the branches ... I hope I didn't mess anything up ...

[12:13:09] <uGoMobi> oh oh
[12:13:28] <_|Nix|_> Man, this is killing me ...
[12:13:58] <gseguin> reflog to the rescue?
[12:14:25] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ^^
[12:15:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: git merge a b; git merge b a; always results in complications.
[12:16:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: In this case, I managed to merge changes between a and b correctly, but I had merged master into b several times, and now those changes have been reverted :(
[12:17:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, now a is based on an old version of master, and it thinks its up-to-date wrt. master :(
[12:17:21] <gseguin> you can always go back to a state by resetting using reflog to fing the right sha to restore to
[12:17:34] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... but I've already pushed.
[12:17:39] <gseguin> it's ok
[12:17:47] <gseguin> you'll re-commit to fix
[12:18:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I thought I had carefully checked to make sure the branches had been merged, but I never expected merges from master to be removed.
[12:18:24] <gseguin> just do not force-push
[12:18:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Exactly. That's what worries me.
[12:18:55] <gseguin> you can't force push by accident
[12:20:35] <_|Nix|_> All is well with the world.
[12:20:37] <_|Nix|_> Worry not.
[12:20:42] <_|Nix|_> My mistake.
[12:21:09] <_|Nix|_> There was another commit on master I had not merged, so of course the diff wrt. master would show that commit in reverse.
[12:21:21] <gseguin> heh
[12:21:25] <_|Nix|_> I should have done a diff wrt merge-base.
[12:21:31] <gseguin> DAMMIT, GIT!
[12:21:36] <_|Nix|_> Not wrt. master.
[12:22:11] <_|Nix|_> I was thinking of doing it wrt. merge-base, but I said "neah ... I'll just go master" *slap forehead*
[12:38:07] <_|Nix|_> Hey, in CSS, is a,b c {} equivalent to a c{} b c{}?
[12:39:35] <gseguin> nope
[12:39:43] <gseguin> , is a selector separator
[12:39:48] <gseguin> isn't it?
[12:40:27] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, and I guess there's no way to group them.
[12:40:51] <gseguin> not that I know of
[12:43:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure what you mean... do you want to group selectors or different rules?
[12:44:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think I got it. Check out the commit I just made. That does what we want, right?
[12:45:18] * _|Nix|_ is a white-belt at CSS-fu.
[12:45:50] <_|Nix|_> K, so no jqmobilecommit jumping into the channel?
[12:47:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this won't work
[12:48:07] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ...
[12:48:34] <uGoMobi> because the rules we apply after that will inherit the "0" you just set
[12:48:44] <_|Nix|_> It worked with my simple controlgroup example ... *whimper* ...
[12:49:09] <_|Nix|_> Nono, but the rule following it replaces the 0 with the inherit for first-child and last-child.
[12:49:51] <uGoMobi> ah sorry, the ui-corner-all class is on the controlgroup
[12:50:29] <_|Nix|_> OK, so does it work, after all?
[12:50:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah should be ok
[12:51:16] <_|Nix|_> Yaaaay! I did something right in CSS ...
[12:51:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think some of the selectors aren't necessary though
[12:52:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I just copied your selector and removed :first-child.
[12:52:29] <uGoMobi> have to give a closer look because the checkbox radio and selects are a bit complicated
[12:52:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, that's why I should expand the functional test.
[12:55:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: are you working on collapsible CSS too? because I was working at collapsible and controlgroup CSS refresh solution too
[12:57:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, looks like controlgroup doesn't need refresh, right?
[12:58:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not for corner styling
[12:58:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Try to make collapsible work without refresh, and I'll make the controlgroup functional test include selects and checkboxes to make sure the style works out.
[12:58:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does it need refresh for anything else?
[12:58:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: s/it/controlgroup/
[12:58:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: don't think so
[12:59:09] <_|Nix|_> OK, good. One down, n-1 to go :)
[12:59:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how about the border bottom on the last item?
[13:00:28] <uGoMobi> we have to do that with CSS now too, right?
[13:00:53] <uGoMobi> that would mean it won't work on IE7/8
[13:02:01] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[13:02:10] <_|Nix|_> :(
[13:02:23] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... refresh(), after all?
[13:02:46] * _|Nix|_ curses all things M$ ... what a scourge upon the face of our beautiful planet :(
[13:06:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can we assign a class to the container that has a bottom border and nothing else, and only if ( $.mobile.browser.ie )?
[13:07:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but, I guess that would also do it on WP7 ...
[13:09:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the border-bottom-width has to be set on the last item, not the container
[13:09:55] <uGoMobi> the color is defined by the theme swatch that is set for the list item, not the container
[13:10:51] <uGoMobi> list item in case of listviews, but same goes for controlgroup items
[13:11:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We also need to override ui-shadow for buttons inside controlgroups ... I just realized ...
[13:13:02] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: Andy's article/tutorial is up :-)
[13:13:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno which is cleaner ... all these CSS overrides, or to just have a refresh which removes corners and shadow ...
[13:14:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but it's extremely cool to add/remove stuff and have things just work without having to call .refresh()!
[13:15:48] <arschmitz> having to call refresh is a super common mistake people make too! as iv been watching the forum / #jquerymobile it seems like 1/4 of the problems involve people not calling refresh!
[13:15:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: controlgroups don't have shadow at all so ui-controlgroup .ui-shadow { box-shadow: 0; } would resolve that
[13:17:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, I was thinking about adding box-shadow: none to that selector that removes corners as well.
[13:19:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lets do this a carefully, the ui-focus style uses box-shadow too
[13:20:30] <_|Nix|_> Uh-oh ...
[13:20:30] <uGoMobi> really have to look at all (edge) cases before applying those rules
[13:21:14] <_|Nix|_> You're right!
[13:28:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: .ui-controlgroup .ui-shadow:not(.ui-focus) { box-shadow: 0; } ... but of course that turns on .ui-shadow as well, but only when the ui-focus class is present.
[13:28:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It looks good, but it's a dirty way to do it.
[13:29:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, when you add .ui-focus, all shadows appear, and when you remove it, they all disappear.
[13:29:10] <uGoMobi> why is it dirty?
[13:29:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Because when ui-focus is present, you get the blue shadow as well as the black shadow, but you cannot see the black shadow because of the blue shadow.
[13:30:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if somebody decides to have a really large black shadow and a really small blue shadow, all of a sudden a focused button will have a shadow that disappears with the focus.
[13:30:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, but I don't think we can do that because ui-focus and ui-shadow are themeable
[13:31:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly. That's why the above selector doesn't work.
[13:31:46] <uGoMobi> although, if ui-focus comes after ui-shadow in the CSS it shouldn;t be a problem
[13:32:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Interesting point. I guess if one shadow replaces another, then we're good.
[13:32:45] <uGoMobi> yeah that's what happens because they use same property
[13:32:52] <_|Nix|_> OK, then we're golden.
[13:33:04] <uGoMobi> so it overrides, it doesn't apply it on top
[13:33:09] <_|Nix|_> Excellent!
[13:33:58] <_|Nix|_> My CSS skilz0rz are improving by the minute!
[13:34:27] <_|Nix|_> Is :not() supported everywhere?
[13:35:06] <_|Nix|_> OK, we use it in several places. I've stopped worrying about its availability.
[13:35:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, :not() is not supported on IE7/8
[13:36:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I used it for corner styling because IE7/8 don't support border-radius anyway

[13:36:52] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[13:36:58] <_|Nix|_> Seriously ...
[13:37:40] <_|Nix|_> OK ... NM ... back to square 0 ...
[13:38:21] <_|Nix|_> Seriously, the amount of extra work IE causes is a major contributing cause to climate change.
[13:38:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think it's better to test on all browsers before committing
[13:38:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: *sigh* ... reverting ...

[13:39:31] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/css-corner-styling 1c40b0b Gabriel Schulhof: Revert "[controlgroup css] Turn off shadow for children, but not if ui-focus is present"...
[13:39:40] <_|Nix|_> OK, but then we're stuck.
[13:40:05] <_|Nix|_> We need .refresh() so we can call .buttonMarkup({shadow: false})
[13:41:10] <_|Nix|_> ... and if we do that, we might as well revive ui-controlgroup-last, which adds the bottom border.
[13:44:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually IE7/8 don't support box-shadow either
[13:44:33] <uGoMobi> so I think we can use it anyway
[13:46:28] <uGoMobi> but like I said, I prefer to do this a bit more carefully... when I make changes to the CSS I always test on all browsers with test pages that contain edge cases
[13:52:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, well, in that case we can put it back. I'll put it back and then I'll take my hands off it and concentrate on the functional test and leave the CSS to the experts ...
[13:52:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Agreed?
[13:52:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[13:53:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will test it tomorrow
