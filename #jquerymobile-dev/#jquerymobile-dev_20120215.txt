[02:31:05] <VictorCL> hi
[07:12:44] <Wilto> Mornin’.
[07:14:48] <Wilto> johnbender, you around yet?
[07:59:38] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Hey! So, I fixed that regression (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3578)
[07:59:38] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (8h, 19m ago): [buttonMarkup] Remember applied classes so as to unapply only those at t...
[08:00:00] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I tested it with the docs pages, and the buttons in the header were OK.
[08:00:37] <Wilto> Sweeeet.
[08:00:49] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Are you comfortable throwing a couple of unit tests together for this change?
[08:01:49] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I'm not really familiar with writing unit tests, but I can have a look at what's already there and adapt one of the existing ones - most likely.
[08:03:15] <Wilto> That’s my mission today, as well. toddmparker_ and I are on a unit testing crusade today, though—I think it’s something we gotta start enforcing.
[08:03:24] <Wilto> cc johnbender, whose ears are likely ringing as we speak.
[08:05:30] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Ummm ... what exactly should the unit test look like? Create a button inside a header and see if it has the ui-btn-left class?
[08:08:41] * _|Nix|_ is looking at tests/unit/buttonMarkup/index.html ... woah ... head spinning ..
[08:09:19] <Wilto> Yeah, it’s a lot to take in at a glance.
[08:11:14] <Wilto> And I always defer to johnbender on the details, but toddmparker_ and I were just reasoning out some quick tests:
[08:12:42] <Wilto> If a header contains one button, does it get ui-btn-left? If there’s two, does the second get ui-btn-right? If the first button already has ui-btn-right attached, does that override the ui-btn-left default?
[08:13:10] <Wilto> Just try to think of a few conditions you’d put in there to confirm things visually, and then test for the associated classes.
[08:13:46] <Wilto> In terms of your update, you’d want to ensure that a manually-written button doesn’t get double enhanced—do the classes stay the same, does the markup stay the same, do the bindings still apply?
[08:14:30] <Wilto> Writing tests is actually pretty entertaining. Logic puzzles, y’know?
[08:19:46] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: A manually-written button? How do you recognize that?
[08:20:35] <Wilto> If the user hand-writes the markup.
[08:20:55] <Wilto> So you’d just have the “enhanced” markup already in the page. That whole thing.
[08:20:59] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Like, <a><span class=" ... ui-btn-inner ... "><span class=" ... ui-btn-text ...">...</span></span></a>?
[08:21:40] <Wilto> Yeah.
[08:22:04] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: What about <input type="button" ... and <button ...?
[08:22:27] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I suppose if I got one of those, I could look at the parents ...
[08:22:33] <Wilto> Those are in another set of tests. You’ve just been working on buttonMarkup in that capacity, yeah?
[08:24:05] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I didn't really touch forms.button, except to point it in the right direction when retrieving the text span.
[08:24:24] <Wilto> Yeah, I’d just focus on buttonMarkup tests, then.
[08:25:02] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: How's this for a unit test: https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/jquery-mobile/commit/20f38365a6cf1a8069c996a28afd75d2567145fd
[08:25:03] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (1m, 49s ago): [buttonMarkup] unit tests: Check for header classes
[08:25:48] <Wilto> And again, johnbender can be more help in terms of the actual testing syntax and such; he’s kind of the Keeper of the Tests, which is exactly the problem we’re trying to solve. No one person should be the main honcho of the test suite—we all should be.
[08:26:17] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Well, I ran the test and it passed :)
[08:26:38] <Wilto> Nice. I might be more specific—test the first button for ui-btn-left, test the second for ui-btn-right.
[08:27:33] <Wilto> But yeah, totally on the right track.
[08:27:38] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: OK.
[08:27:53] <johnbender> Wilto: around
[08:28:08] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Also: Recognizing manually written buttons might not be hard, but figuring out what classes they've manually gotten is hard.
[08:28:09] <Wilto> johnbender: No worries, dude. I’ve just been invoking your name all over the place.
[08:28:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I changed the build to fire once an hour and on any changes made to github
[08:28:33] <johnbender> so at worst it will be delayed by an hour
[08:29:09] <johnbender> in the case where it breaks because of java exceptions
[08:29:37] <toddmparker_> cool, that's great johnbender
[08:29:40] <johnbender> Wilto: have you figured out a way to write tests for those buttons etc?
[08:29:46] <toddmparker_> so there's a plan B if things go wrong
[08:29:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah so long as it's not broken from something we did
[08:30:25] <Wilto> johnbender: The header buttons? I think we’ve got something worked out, yeah.
[08:31:19] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_ also mentioned the toggle switches are there still issues there?
[08:31:28] <toddmparker_> yeah
[08:31:36] <Wilto> johnbender: Yeah. Looks like we lost the `mini` styling.
[08:31:43] <Wilto> I’m writing tests for that now—that’s 100% on me.
[08:31:48] <Wilto> But they’s busted.
[08:31:54] <johnbender> Wilto: arg, sorry
[08:32:02] <johnbender> let me look at the diff
[08:32:06] <Wilto> Oh, no worries, dude.
[08:33:23] <toddmparker_> the slider and toggle don't get the "mini" size as of yesterday
[08:33:55] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[08:33:56] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #99: FIXED in 2 min 11 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/99/
[08:33:56] <jq-jenkins> mat: Fixes regression accidentally committed in 954820.
[08:34:04] <toddmparker_> you can test here johnbender - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/forms-all-mini.html
[08:34:07] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: I see it in the diff, one sec
[08:34:10] <toddmparker_> the slide should have a tiny handle
[08:34:23] <toddmparker_> the flip switch shouldn't be quite that tall
[08:34:26] <toddmparker_> kk
[08:36:27] <johnbender> Wilto: neither the inline class nor the mini class were being added to the slider
[08:36:59] <Wilto> dammit something something too tired for this running gag
[08:37:01] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Now testing for individual buttons: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3578/files#diff-1
[08:37:02] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (8h, 56m ago): [buttonMarkup] Remember applied classes so as to unapply only those at t...
[08:37:47] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Perfect, man.
[08:38:30] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So, about the manually created buttons ... not sure I can pick up the existing options, even if I can recognize that it is a manually created button. I mean, it'll be a nightmare of if statements ...
[08:39:01] <Wilto> I wouldn’t worry about every possible set of factors, on that test.
[08:39:25] <johnbender> Wilto: can I push the fix I made?
[08:39:29] <Wilto> I mean, you don’t have to check that the 'ui-mini' class applies if the user added it themselves, y’know?
[08:39:35] <Wilto> johnbender: Fire away.
[08:40:27] <johnbender> Wilto: what does the inline class accomplish for the slider?
[08:40:51] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I do, if I want to be able to remove it if she also passes in the option mini: false ...
[08:40:58] <Wilto> I would just check a few things, _|Nix|_: if the markup contains a class that is only applied at the time of enhancement (.ui-btn, in this case), we assume they’re hand-writing the markup. Does it then skip enhancement for that element? Do the bindings still apply normally?
[08:41:24] <Wilto> johnbender: I’m not certain I have any styles associated therewith, as it stands now.
[08:41:38] <Wilto> johnbender: I’d have to go through and recheck.
[08:43:01] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I guess not. I suppose I could write in that safeguard. After all, it was skipping /all/ subsequent enhancement, and now it's not skipping any subsequent enhancement, but it does assume that all previous enhancement happened via buttonMarkup ...
[08:43:35] <johnbender> Wilto: ok, that was also missing but I added it again
[08:44:24] <Wilto> johnbender: http://wil.to/_/success.gif
[08:44:41] <toddmparker_> super guys!
[08:45:42] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:45:59] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I shall have to resume this struggle somewhat later ... HTH so far ...
[08:47:27] <Wilto> Absolutely, _|Nix|_. Mo’ tests > no tests, always.
[08:52:18] <johnbender> Wilto: I *might* take issue with that but for this project I will agree
[08:52:35] <toddmparker_> wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/a590f135ed455fe07e5db8fb0846aad00b7068c4/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html
[08:52:40] <Wilto> Yeah, y’know, at this juncture anyway.
[08:53:18] <Wilto> I’d rather have excessive tests and nuke some, the way things stand right now.
[08:57:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: just posted the same on basecamp
[08:57:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: `git log -p` ?
[08:58:18] <toddmparker_> cool, thanks johnbender
[08:58:25] <toddmparker_> tracked down the offending commit
[08:58:28] <toddmparker_> MAT
[08:59:17] <Wilto> DAMMIT, WILTO
[09:01:43] <Wilto> Fixing it now.
[09:02:01] <johnbender> Wilto: I think you can revert for a specific file
[09:02:01] <toddmparker_> is this a real issue or just bad code? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1148
[09:02:02] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1148 on jquery-mobile, reported by strick (11m, 3w ago): pageshow not fired when user clicks refresh
[09:02:02] <johnbender> let me check
[09:02:55] <Wilto> johnbender: git checkout [commit-ref] -- [filename]?
[09:03:19] <Wilto> Looks like it screws with history, though. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/725749/how-would-you-go-about-reverting-a-single-file-to-previous-commit-state-using-gi
[09:04:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: he probably wants to bind on the document, and live is deprecatd
[09:04:57] <johnbender> Wilto: lemme check
[09:05:35] <toddmparker_> thanks johnbender
[09:06:20] <johnbender> Wilto: you can do it with git revert and some reset chicanery
[09:06:23] <johnbender> Wilto: one sec
[09:06:57] <Wilto> Woah, woah—I only go so far as “shenanigans,” and the occasional “hornswoggle.” Chicanery is outside of my wheelhouse.

[09:07:58] <Wilto> Nothing blows up in history with that?
[09:08:53] <johnbender> Wilto: it just creates a new commit that's the inverse of the commit that corresponds to the hash you provide
[09:09:01] <johnbender> so no
[09:09:07] <johnbender> it doesn't alter history because it creates a new commit
[09:09:25] <Wilto> Very Doctor Who. I like it.
[09:10:31] <Wilto> I don’t have to specify the file?
[09:10:35] <Wilto> That’s a little scary.

[09:12:20] <johnbender> I'm heading out now
[09:12:31] <Wilto> Horizontal scroll bars? NOT ON MY WATCH
[09:12:41] <Wilto> johnbender: Real quick, before you take off:
[09:13:05] <Wilto> I don’t have to specify the file? Just `git revert ec26d08e2fc382c74c2c28261e70e1f6cf3e3a5c`?
[09:13:15] <Wilto> That won’t revert, y’know, all the things?
[09:15:54] <Wilto> Researching.
[09:16:35] <gseguin> Wilto: do `git show ec26d08e2fc382c74c2c28261e70e1f6cf3e3a5c`
[09:16:52] <Wilto> Huh. Unrelated, is this something we should all know about: http://book.git-scm.com/4_maintaining_git.html
[09:16:53] <gseguin> `git revert ec26d08e2fc382c74c2c28261e70e1f6cf3e3a5c` will revert just that
[09:17:53] <gseguin> a gc is good to do every once in a while but git should do it for you when needed

[09:37:16] <gseguin> Wilto: with git revert it would have generated the commit automagically for you

[09:49:01] <gseguin> is that not what you wanted?
[09:49:24] <Wilto> Ahh. How would I revert an entire file to its former state?
[09:50:02] <gseguin> well that was its former state before that commit
[09:50:51] <gseguin> it you want to retrieve a particular revision of the file

[10:05:47] <johnbender> Wilto: what you can do if you want to revert a single file is ...
[10:05:52] <johnbender> git revert foocommit
[10:06:17] <johnbender> git reset --soft HEAD~ # this will pull the changes made in the revert commit back out into the index
[10:06:32] <johnbender> git reset HEAD . # this will pull the changes made into the file system
[10:06:48] <johnbender> git add the/path/of/the/file/you/want.html
[10:07:01] <johnbender> git checkout . # this will clear out the other changes

[11:15:42] <johnbender> Wilto: _|Nix|_ reviewd
[11:15:49] <johnbender> what are we addressing there?
[11:16:13] <johnbender> it mentions something about saving classes to check against
[11:17:38] <johnbender> but I don't see anything to that effect
[11:33:47] <gseguin> johnbender: sed doesn't have -i on osx
[11:34:30] <gseguin> as a result `make docs` doesn't work on osx :(
[11:34:42] * gseguin looks into an alternative
[11:37:08] <johnbender> gseguin: wtf
[11:38:54] <gseguin> johnbender: I get: sed: 1: "tmp/demos/tools/page-ch ...": undefined label 'mp/demos/tools/page-change-time.html'
[11:39:01] <gseguin> for every html file
[11:42:02] <johnbender> gseguin: ok
[11:42:09] <johnbender> I think it's just how it interacts with find
[11:42:20] <johnbender> sed -i '' -e's///' works

[12:05:49] <gseguin> what is it?
[12:09:07] <johnbender> gseguin: jesus
[12:09:09] <johnbender> well
[12:09:28] <johnbender> it's a semi random combination of option arguments with spaces and without

[12:14:45] <johnbender> ... nevermind one sec
[12:28:20] <johnbender> gseguin: alright
[12:28:32] <johnbender> gseguin: I have a solution
[12:28:50] <johnbender> I have a hunch this is a result of the gpl purge being done by apple
[12:29:00] <johnbender> the osx version of sed is from 05 :(
[12:29:09] <johnbender> because later versions are gpl3
[12:29:14] <johnbender> but I'm going to verify that later
[12:29:16] <johnbender> I have a fix
[12:29:19] <johnbender> however ghetto
[12:34:04] <johnbender> gseguin: to be clear I'm not saying it's apple's fault only that the conflict of interest with gpl3 is the cause of the outdated sed
[12:37:23] <johnbender> gseguin: ok I'm wrong
[12:37:26] <johnbender> it's just the bsd
[12:40:17] <Wilto> Guys. I hate CSS.
[12:40:21] <Wilto> I hate _all_ CSS.

[12:43:27] <mrassi> hi
[12:43:46] <johnbender> mrassi: hey I'm just about to step out ot lunch is that bad timing :( :( :(
[12:44:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 4 new commits to master: http://git.io/_f08kg
[12:44:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Updated docs with caution against using .ui-bar to add padding to full-width header/footer bars. - Mat Marquis
[12:44:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Moved .ui-bar note PPs in docs for better flow. - Mat Marquis
[12:44:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes issue with text/icons being positioned too close to one another, in buttons within toolbars. - Mat Marquis
[12:44:04] <mrassi> ah it's ok no problem i'll be here for another 6 hours :) enjoy
[13:01:03] <mrassi> whenever you get a chance I'd like input:
[13:01:06] <mrassi> Is there any way to assign some kind of identifier for each sub test name inside a test that are inside a suite. For instance for the "dialog" suite (http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/unit/dialog/), the first test is "dialog hash is added when the dialog is opened and removed when closed" which is composed of two sub tests which don't really have any identifier to them just a pass/fail status and an incremental number 1,2 etc.. but this number i
[13:01:33] <mrassi> We currently have a system that keep's track of data to the lowest denominator so when we do regression check there is no digging around log files we have an exact display of new/removed/passed/skipped/failed skipped tests per build. Here it seems with this lack of identifiers we need alternatives. We could either 1. not go as deep as subtest 2. edit parse the .js test files and use the entire qunit code as test name 'same("...")'' 3. modify quni
[13:01:42] <mrassi> What are your thoughts on this? Does it make sense to go subtest level for these kind of tests and if so how would you assign unique identifiers to each test name?
[13:02:38] <mrassi> *to each subtestname
[13:20:12] <johnbender> mrassi: when you say subtest do you mean assertions?
[13:20:28] <johnbender> so test("foo", function() { ok(true); });
[13:20:38] <johnbender> foo is the test
[13:20:42] <johnbender> and ok is the subtest
[13:24:38] <mrassi> johnbender: yes that's what I mean by subtest

[13:25:18] <mrassi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/unit/dialog/
[13:25:19] <johnbender> mrassi: the assertion results are available in the markup
[13:25:40] <johnbender> lawl
[13:25:44] <mrassi> the first subtest on this page is "1. Setup failed on dialog hash is added when the dialog is opened and removed when closed: Cannot read property 'page' of undefined"
[13:26:01] <gseguin> johnbender: did you push your change?
[13:26:18] <johnbender> gseguin: I think I did
[13:26:25] <johnbender> gseguin: oops
[13:26:26] <johnbender> conflict
[13:26:40] <johnbender> gseguin: pushed
[13:26:56] <gseguin> thanks sorry you're never gonna have lunch man
[13:27:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/JQJHoQ
[13:27:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] fix for bsd/linux sed incompat - John Bender
[13:27:07] <johnbender> gseguin: already got it :D
[13:27:14] <gseguin> heh :)
[13:28:23] <johnbender> mrassi: maybe a hash of the url with the testname and the assertion output?
[13:28:32] <johnbender> mrassi: or just the concat of each
[13:28:47] <johnbender> since we don't have a standard lib in js :(
[13:29:14] <mrassi> mrassi: but the assertion changes based on status?
[13:29:57] <johnbender> mrassi: those are exceptions though
[13:34:47] <johnbender> mrassi: looking into why there are those crazy exceptions on test/tests/
[13:35:16] <mrassi> johnbender: ah ok it seems output only does change on exceptions so that's ok we can use assertion as test name then
[13:35:41] <johnbender> mrassi: I see what you mean in your care about that being an issue
[13:35:50] <mrassi> johnbender: hopefully there won't ever be two assertions with same name
[13:35:51] <johnbender> I guess just check for the exception before reporting
[13:36:02] <johnbender> mrassi: well they have numbers there too right?
[13:36:10] <johnbender> I thought the same thing but qunit tracks the count
[13:36:22] <johnbender> I think at least
[13:36:25] * johnbender goes to check again
[13:36:59] <mrassi> I'm not convinced in using the count for anything, just shuffling the test around in execution will change that number and will be incomparable in regression looking for that name
[13:36:59] <johnbender> mrassi: yah it has the numbers for each assertion pass fail or exception
[13:37:18] <johnbender> mrassi: hmm that's a good point
[13:37:43] <johnbender> mrassi: so there's another callback that might be of use
[13:37:45] <johnbender> testDone
[13:37:52] <johnbender> maybe you can keep your own representation?
[13:38:01] <johnbender> or there might be more information there?
[13:38:03] <johnbender> dunno
[13:39:26] <mrassi> i'll play with it now
[13:39:34] <gseguin> jrburke: are you there ?
[13:39:39] <johnbender> mrassi: seems unlikely
[13:39:45] <johnbender> I can't come up with anything obvious
[13:40:14] <mrassi> It's ok I could start this project by first getting it working with the test then at a later time when we are less in a rush expand to subtest tracking
[13:40:45] <johnbender> mrassi: I mean I don't even know how qunit would provide a canonical representation of the assertion that is robust across both rename and reorder
[13:41:02] <johnbender> unless the test had to be in a callback and you toStringed the callback
[13:41:07] <johnbender> even then you don't have a guarantee
[13:41:19] <johnbender> mrassi: how does that work elsewhere
[13:43:14] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #480: SUCCESS in 27 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/480/
[13:44:24] <mrassi> in one of our frameworks we have the test suite (collection of classes), the module (class) and the tests (functions) so the functoon name doesn't really change it's either removed or added
[13:45:18] <mrassi> I'll play around with it now, I was just probing looking for input
[13:45:32] <mrassi> thanks
[13:48:00] <Wilto> johnbender: Not to keep pestering you, but you got a sec for another test question?
[13:48:00] <bot-t> (6 mins 24 secs ago) <necolas> tell Wilto oh I thought it might go to a demo page or something. is there a demo url somewhere?
[13:51:41] <jrburke> gseguin: i'm back now
[13:51:49] <gseguin> hey
[13:52:07] <gseguin> I was trying to upgrade to 1.0.6 in jqm
[13:52:33] <gseguin> and I get an error:
[13:52:34] <gseguin> node.js:201
[13:52:34] <gseguin>         throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
[13:52:34] <gseguin>               ^
[13:52:34] <gseguin> Error: Error evaluating module "undefined" at location "undefined":
[13:52:34] <gseguin> TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
[13:52:35] <gseguin> fileName:undefined
[13:52:35] <gseguin> lineNumber: undefined
[13:52:36] <gseguin> http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html#defineerror
[13:52:45] <gseguin> which is kindda cryptic
[13:53:19] <jrburke> hmm yeah that is not very helpful. I'll pull the latest jqm master code and try it
[13:53:38] <jrburke> gseguin: at the very least I need to catch that error and give it more context.
[13:53:41] <gseguin> if you do `make js` you should get the error
[13:53:54] <jrburke> great, pulling the code now, will report back in a bit
[13:54:05] <gseguin> thanks very much!
[13:56:30] <johnbender> Wilto: go for it
[13:56:43] <Wilto> I think I whined about this before:
[13:58:57] <Wilto> Does it make any sense at all that I’m seeing different results between localdev/tests/unit/?filter=checkboxradio and  localdev/tests/unit/checkboxradio/?
[13:59:25] <johnbender> Wilto: yes because the checkboxradio tests could be order dependent which is bad
[13:59:58] <johnbender> that is the test that you see failing with the first url could depend on state that's set up in the test run before it when visiting the second url
[13:59:59] <Wilto> Which, uh… which is the one I should be looking at?
[14:00:11] <Wilto> Ah-hah.
[14:00:15] <Wilto> (I think.)
[14:00:22] <johnbender> Wilto: so solving both problems in this case would be a good idea
[14:00:38] <johnbender> hopefully we can solve the general case for that at some point soon
[14:00:44] * johnbender is hopeful
[14:01:34] <Wilto> So…
[14:02:02] <Wilto> When I add markup to the radio/checkbox page to test against, does it make any sense at all that it only shows up in localdev/tests/unit/checkboxradio/?
[14:02:19] <Wilto> Not localdev/tests/unit/?filter=checkboxradio, and not on localdev/tests/unit/
[14:03:47] <johnbender> Wilto: no
[14:03:57] <johnbender> Wilto: we had this conversation yesterday
[14:04:02] <Wilto> What in the actual hell.
[14:04:09] <johnbender> yah that's just weird dood
[14:04:17] <johnbender> Wilto: also if you are running the tests at test/unit/
[14:04:20] <Wilto> —oh, right, I’m an idiot.
[14:04:34] <Wilto> Yesterday was a blur of Dayquil and complaining, truth be told.
[14:04:37] <Wilto> I am.
[14:04:37] <johnbender> you can limit which ones run in tests/unit/ls.php
[14:04:46] <Wilto> Oh, good to know.
[14:04:58] <johnbender> yah it would be nice to add a query param for that but I just haven't
[14:06:02] <johnbender> Wilto: feel free to do that if you want, in the exec property of the test runner
[14:06:20] <johnbender> you can just check dir against some query param value
[14:08:03] <jrburke> gseguin: if you change the r.js command to use main= instead of include=, it works. I changed some config normalization code that made that more strict than it used to be, but I'll create an issue for 1.0.7 to allow include without needing name.
[14:08:11] <Wilto> Woah, looks like it’s some freaky Chrome caching stuff.
[14:08:17] <Wilto> That’s fun.
[14:08:48] <gseguin> ha! that was fast!
[14:09:00] <gseguin> thanks jrburke!
[14:09:09] <gseguin> cool, I'll fix that
[14:17:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Regarding that el.jqmData ... I'm setting all options via el.jqmData because above it in the code, the options are retrieved using el.jqmData ... However, I was thinking that maybe we could change that to getAttribute (lines 22 - 29)
[14:17:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/QcT04A
[14:17:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added a bunch of toolbar in fixed toolbar test pages - toddparker
[14:20:21] <Wilto> In switching from Chrome to Firefox, everything in the test suite now behaves as expected.
[14:20:34] <johnbender> Wilto: caching?
[14:20:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think that's fine
[14:21:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can you ask that in a comment and maybe address kin?
[14:21:17] <johnbender> @jblas on github
[14:21:24] <johnbender> I don't think it would hurt
[14:21:31] <Wilto> Unless I completely nuked my cache after every change to either the JS or markup, I would get sporadic weirdnesses in Chrome.
[14:21:44] <johnbender> Wilto: chrome dev tools lets you turn off the cahce
[14:21:47] <Wilto> ¡Fantástico!
[14:21:54] <johnbender> the little gear in the bottom right
[14:21:56] <Wilto> Eh, just as well working in FF.
[14:22:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Cool ...
[14:22:39] <johnbender> gseguin: I  think we have an implicit dependency: init depends on page
[14:22:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I dunno much about getAttribute but I suspect we might run into problems with things like boolean values ... just a hunch ...
[14:22:53] <johnbender> gseguin: if you don't enhance at least one page it will fail with an exception
[14:23:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that might be why it was left that way, let me look at a blame real fast
[14:23:35] * gseguin looks
[14:24:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... in which case the line you commented on in my PR must also be left in place.
[14:24:26] <johnbender> gseguin: init just expects that the pages retrieved by the selector can be used as arguments to changePage which in turn expect page data to be attached
[14:25:06] <gseguin> johnbender: line?
[14:25:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ahh because jqmData doesn't consult the attributes after the first try :(
[14:25:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: AFAICT jqmData doesn't consult the attributes, period.
[14:26:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It just normalizes the key and passes it off to $.data ....
[14:26:49] <gseguin> johnbender: you're talking about initializePage() ?
[14:27:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: :/ so let me rephrase ... "_DATA_ doesn't consult the attributes after the first try
[14:27:06] <johnbender> gseguin: yes
[14:27:17] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.init.js#L141
[14:27:32] <gseguin> yeah I don't think that's a dependency
[14:27:42] <johnbender> ?
[14:27:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I also don't quite understand "after the first try" ... heh ... *scratch head*
[14:27:59] <gseguin> because it doesn't matter if the page has been enabled (in absolute)
[14:28:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think data will only get the attributes the first time and then it caches the values as data attached to the js object
[14:28:18] <johnbender> gseguin: ? it does though
[14:28:20] <johnbender> it borks
[14:28:25] <johnbender> it will through an exception
[14:28:29] <johnbender> *throw
[14:28:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Bah! Terrible ... it'd be much nicer if it kept them in sync :(
[14:28:43] <johnbender> changepage attempts to access the page data
[14:28:50] <gseguin> oh ok
[14:29:08] * johnbender sighs
[14:29:13] <johnbender> nav is such a tangle :(
[14:29:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Of course, that's asking a lot, because $.data can store arbitrarily complex objects and stuff, whereas attributes can be strings and only strings ...
[14:29:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's probably why it doesn't go back to checking the attribute.
[14:30:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah! so we're at the original problem then
[14:30:16] <johnbender> that's what fixed the "doesn't update the values" ?
[14:30:26] <johnbender> or didn't fix it
[14:30:30] <johnbender> I'm still unclear on that
[14:30:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah ... you need to do el.jqmData(key, value) at that line, or else you get weirdness.
[14:32:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Comment out that line, and do the steps at the top of the PR. Really weird. The <a> develops a shadow even though it's been turned off, whereas the other two do not.
[14:33:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: gimme one sec I'll take another look
[14:33:37] <johnbender> gseguin: I might be wrong here
[14:33:45] <Wilto> I got sour news for you too, johnbender.
[14:33:53] <johnbender> gseguin: in fact I think I am
[14:34:07] <johnbender> gseguin: I have the execution order out of whack in my head

[14:43:55] <johnbender> or that least that's the way it looks
[14:44:16] <Wilto> Oh-ho.
[14:44:21] <Wilto> Thanks for tracking that down, johnbender.
[14:44:23] <johnbender> let me see about adding it in
[14:44:28] <johnbender> Wilto: unless you got it
[14:44:44] <Wilto> Wouldn’t mind you dropping that in, if you’ve got a sec.
[14:44:51] <johnbender> Wilto: sure thing
[14:44:51] <Wilto> gseguin: Tragically so!
[14:45:03] <johnbender> Wilto: so from our earlier conversation about testing for classes etc
[14:45:11] <johnbender> this is one of those cases where it would have saved us
[14:45:13] <Wilto> Thanks bruh.
[14:45:25] <Wilto> Truth.
[14:45:32] <johnbender> that's why it's 1000000000000 times better to write small changes and add a test for each little bit
[14:45:35] <johnbender> so you don't miss stuff
[14:45:53] <johnbender> Wilto: not only you t hough
[14:45:57] <johnbender> everyone including myself
[14:46:07] <Wilto> No, yeah, I’m on a crusade today. I have seen the light.
[14:48:09] <johnbender> Wilto: I don't think I can fix this
[14:48:10] <Wilto> Now that I’m not flailing quite so helplessly at the test suite, I’m erring on the side of testing.
[14:48:17] <johnbender> we need to ask scott about the div he removed
[14:49:27] <Wilto> No worries; kick it back my way, and I’ll either catch up with him tomorrow or whip up something special for the non-switch sliders myself.
[14:52:29] <_|Nix|_> Nighterz, y'all ...
[14:52:53] <gseguin> later _|Nix|_
[15:19:21] <johnbender> Wilto: yah I'm not sure how that fits in :(
[15:23:24] <johnbender> Wilto: ok I send out the message to you and scott with a link, and I commented on the dif
[15:23:33] <johnbender> it might just be that the div needs to get added back in
