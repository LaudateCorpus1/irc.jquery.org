[01:35:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/transitions-sequential-simultaneous] wrapped and refactored portions of the default transitionHandler function to allow for sequential or simultaneous transitions. The default sequential transition handler for 1.1 should not change at all. Both types are defined as different transition handlers ($.mobile.transitionHandlers.simultaneous and $.mobile.transitionHandlers.sequential), though their logic is shared internally 
[01:35:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/transitions-sequential-simultaneous] updated slide transition to use the simultaneous handler. - scottjehl
[01:35:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/transitions-sequential-simultaneous] changed default of minScrollBack to 250 - the value still claimed in the docs. This reverts @toddparker's change in commit a6dc847474cd43b10d85744c66bd1d9ccce1632a, as a higher number is needed when reintroducing simultaneous transitions - scottjehl
[02:37:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to transitions-sequential-simultaneous: http://git.io/o2cDxA
[02:37:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/transitions-sequential-simultaneous] another small refactor, not changing a lot, but breaking things into specific functions for each stage of the transition - helps with clarity. Critically, the silentScroll call is changed to a single window.scrollTo, which helps keep things synchronized and sequential. - scottjehl

[12:55:43] <deAtog> Hello everyone. I'm having a problem with page transitions in jQuery Mobile git version.. I've got a link with data-rel="back" that seems to cause two backwards transitions rather than one..
[12:56:51] <deAtog> the issue only seems to manifest when pages are loaded via ajax rather than contained within the same document
[13:00:43] <johnbender> deAtog: if you can log an issue on github that would be great
[13:02:49] <deAtog> johnbender: if you want to see the issue in action, I can give you the url to my app..
[13:04:57] <deAtog> johnbender: I just tested it on an Android 4.0.3 emulator and am getting the same results :-/
[13:10:23] <johnbender> deAtog: I can take a look but it's better to just log the issue either way in case I get pulled away
[13:11:23] <johnbender> deAtog: even better, if you can take the time to shrink your example to the bare minimum required to reproduce it and then post it or put it in a jsbin or jsfiddle it will help us address the issue more quickly
[13:14:44] <deAtog> johnbender: the app with the issue is here: http://dev.itreetools.org/ellingsd/itree/
[13:16:08] <deAtog> if you navigate to Add Tree->Pest and then click on Yes under Tree Stress.. it'll navigate to another page, upon clicking Cancel it'll navigate back to the Pest page, but if you click Yes again then followed by Cancel you end back up at the Add Tree page
[13:17:30] <deAtog> sorry.. url should be http://dev.itreetools.org/ellingsd/itree/home.php
[13:18:29] <tbenzige> toddparker: ping
[13:18:41] <johnbender> deAtog: alright, I'm going to post all the to an issue on github
[13:21:09] <deAtog> johnbender: I've only seen the issue on Android.. I can't seem to reproduce the issue on my desktop under Firefox 11

[13:21:29] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3939 on jquery-mobile (johnbender; 25.645s ago): two backward transitions with data-rel='back' in latest
[13:21:38] <johnbender> if you want me to change any of that (ie the links) just let me know
[13:21:52] <johnbender> but then we'll need a sample using jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net
[13:27:12] <deAtog> it's a bit hard to demonstrate on jsfiddle or jsbin since it only occurs with the pages are contained in individual files and are loaded via ajax
[13:40:02] <toddparker> johnbender and tbenzige - i'm here if you have q's
[13:40:25] <Wilto> johnbender and tbenzige: I am not here, if you have questions.

[13:59:35] <gseguin> johnbender: which file was add by that merge?
[14:00:35] <tbenzige> toddparker: yeah sorry if that was confusing
[14:00:48] <johnbender> gseguin: two css files
[14:01:05] <tbenzige> so I like the inspector toggle button and quickswatch/kuler section a lot
[14:01:05] <gseguin> the .keyframes.css ones
[14:01:19] <gseguin> yep
[14:01:28] <tbenzige> i was thinking we could get some extra some space if we reworked the download, import, help, and share links
[14:01:55] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[14:02:17] <gseguin> where are these used ?
[14:02:29] <gseguin> I'm confused
[14:04:33] <gseguin> oh got it
[14:04:45] <gseguin> or at least I think I do
[14:05:34] <toddparker> gseguin/johnbender - are you guys talking about files added with Scott's commit?
[14:05:40] <gseguin> yes
[14:05:59] <toddparker> he added a new transition to break out slide (sync) and slide fade (async)
[14:06:04] <toddparker> so there is a css and js
[14:06:20] <gseguin> indeed
[14:06:21] <toddparker> so now slide works like slide did at 1.0
[14:06:28] <toddparker> slide fade is our 1.1 flavor
[14:06:35] <gseguin> using keyframes
[14:06:45] <toddparker> yeah, all do
[14:06:58] <gseguin> duh :)
[14:07:04] <gseguin> indeed
[14:07:05] <toddparker> they use different handlers and 50% different css keyframes
[14:07:11] <toddparker> :)
[14:07:19] <toddparker> sorry, didn't meant o sound snarky
[14:07:46] <toddparker> tbenzige: i'll answer your q's, promise
[14:07:48] <gseguin> no no, I'm sorry for not knowing
[14:08:06] <gseguin> but then I don't understand why there are 2 new css files
[14:08:07] <toddparker> oh, you were asking? yes. keyframes across the board
[14:08:15] <toddparker> what are they?
[14:08:22] <gseguin> why aren't they merged into the slide.css
[14:08:40] <gseguin> slidein.keyframes.css and slideout.keyframes.css
[14:08:51] <toddparker> what used to be one transition type (slide) is now two separate ones (slide and slide fade)
[14:09:01] <toddparker> lemme look
[14:09:30] <toddparker> oh, i see
[14:10:01] <toddparker> since both slide and slide fade use the same keyframes for about half the animations
[14:10:16] <toddparker> i guess scott broke out the shared bits so they can be referenced by both
[14:10:41] <toddparker> so slide.css and slide fade.css are the two core transition files
[14:11:05] <gseguin> oh ok
[14:11:12] <toddparker> but each reference css keyframes in those external files
[14:11:28] <toddparker> so those would be additional dependencies for the transitions
[14:11:30] <gseguin> it's starting to make sense
[14:11:31] <deAtog> johnbender: disabling pushState seems to fix it..
[14:11:46] <toddparker> so slide.js would need slide.css plus
[14:11:46] <toddparker> jquery.mobile.transitions.slideout.keyframes
[14:11:55] <toddparker> jquery.mobile.transitions.slidein.keyframes
[14:12:09] <toddparker> double check to see if that a is 100% true
[14:12:14] <toddparker> but is seems to make sense
[14:13:02] <gseguin> yep he put a comment at the top of the file that seems to indicate that
[14:13:06] <toddparker> ok
[14:13:23] <toddparker> looks like what I said for deps above is right for slide
[14:13:47] <gseguin> I wonder why he hasn't used @import
[14:13:53] <toddparker> slidefade only uses the slide out.keyframes so it needs slidefade.css and that single file
[14:13:57] <toddparker> it's slooow
[14:14:13] <toddparker> he's assuming that the build will concat these files
[14:14:31] <toddparker> so if I add slide to the build, all 3 css files will be pulled in
[14:14:48] <gseguin> agreed but it's a good native way of expressing dependencies in css
[14:15:03] <gseguin> the build system can strip them
[14:15:08] <toddparker> sure
[14:15:17] <gseguin> I'll look into it
[14:17:01] <toddparker> i see
[14:17:14] <toddparker> so in the js, css dep. is a single file path
[14:17:26] <gseguin> comma separated
[14:17:27] <toddparker> so you can't list 3 files
[14:17:32] <gseguin> you can
[14:17:44] <Wilto> I return
[14:17:50] <toddparker> oh, so we just need to add refs to those other files in the js?
[14:18:16] <toddparker> is that what you mean by you'll look into it?
[14:18:27] <Wilto> My work here is done.
[14:18:30] <gseguin> no I mean looking into @import
[14:18:48] <toddparker> that seems to work, but if you need to use @imports, you can but they should be resolved so there aren't separate requests
[14:18:50] <gseguin> because we already use @import (which gets flattened by the build)
[14:18:56] <toddparker> i see
[14:19:06] <toddparker> so the build will just find and include all @imports
[14:19:08] <gseguin> the structure file is a bunch of imports
[14:19:14] <gseguin> exactly
[14:19:16] <toddparker> right
[14:19:29] <gseguin> I just need to make sure that it doesn't double import
[14:19:36] <toddparker> just curious about the css then
[14:20:03] <toddparker> is the preferred method to only link to a single css from the js meta data, then use @imports inside that css?
[14:20:25] <toddparker> or is it better to list out all the css deps. directly in the js meta data
[14:20:40] <toddparker> know this is a bit of an edge case, but good to know what to do
[14:20:52] <gseguin> I would prefer something that works without a build step
[14:21:16] <toddparker> @import it is then
[14:21:18] <Wilto> Casting my vote for an @import thing.
[14:21:26] <toddparker> hurrah!
[14:21:33] <toddparker> gseguin: you going to add that?
[14:21:39] <gseguin> yep
[14:21:47] <toddparker> with a BC post with the rules
[14:21:56] <gseguin> I think we all violently agree
[14:22:04] <toddparker> do we have a wiki page on all the require stuff?
[14:22:05] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/yep.gif
[14:22:11] <toddparker> might be a good place for stuff like this
[14:22:30] * gseguin hides
[14:22:42] <toddparker> yoooooo hoooo
[14:22:54] <toddparker> hey man, this is your baby
[14:23:16] <gseguin> I know I need to write it in english
[14:23:29] <gseguin> I'll get to it I promise
[14:23:53] <Wilto> English isn’t strictly required.
[14:23:56] <toddparker> no pressure
[14:24:04] <Wilto> I do a lot of my documentation in American Sign Language.
[14:24:05] <toddparker> frenglish
[14:24:15] <gseguin> lol
[14:25:36] <gseguin> Wilto: mind if I tweet that one?
[14:25:42] <Wilto> All yours, dude.
[14:26:21] <Wilto> Pow: retweet.
[15:17:36] <gseguin> toddparker: so I tried building with the @import moved to where they belong
[15:17:49] <gseguin> some css end up being double imported
[15:18:03] <gseguin> I was kind of expecting that
[15:18:28] <gseguin> filed https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/issues/135
[15:18:29] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #135 on r.js (gseguin; 9m, 24s ago): CSS optimizer will import several times the same file
[15:19:32] <gseguin> and talked with jrburke, he said that this may make it into 1.0.8 (next release)
[15:19:42] <gseguin> in the meantime I'll work around it
[15:20:22] <jrburke> for reference, r.js 1.0.8 should be out before the end of next week (jsconf time sink is part of that timeframe)
[15:28:11] <toddparker> gseguin: can we not modify the theme.css when we do the build for unminified
[15:28:13] <toddparker> i
[15:28:25] <toddparker> the changes in the build now are breaking TR import
[15:28:35] <toddparker> hopefully that's an easy one
[15:28:50] <gseguin> are we stripping the comments?
[15:28:56] <gseguin> is that why?
[15:29:04] <tbenzige> yeah
[15:29:08] <gseguin> I thought I fixed that
[15:29:28] <toddparker> maybe something is off again?
[15:29:41] <gseguin> let me check
[15:29:44] <toddparker> tbenzige said you did work on it but it's breaking TR
[15:29:47] <toddparker> k, thanks
[15:30:40] <gseguin> it's the theme.css right?
[15:30:43] <toddparker> can rc1 is the issue
[15:30:48] <toddparker> CDN 1.1rc1
[15:30:52] <tbenzige> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.1.0-rc.1/jquery.mobile-1.1.0-rc.1.css
[15:31:05] <gseguin> I just checked and there are comments in the one I just built
[15:31:18] <gseguin> yuk
[15:31:42] <toddparker> unmagnified should have comments, right?
[15:31:50] <toddparker> thanks auto-correct!
[15:31:52] <gseguin> correct
[15:31:58] <toddparker> un-minified
[15:32:16] <toddparker> so are you saying there are comments in the minified version?
[15:33:33] <tbenzige> gseguin: i'm sure the build script is fixed now, but the cdn-hosted 1.1.0-rc.1 CSS was built before it was fixed
[15:33:48] <gseguin> oh ok
[15:33:58] <gseguin> so that'll be fixed in RC2
[15:33:59] <gseguin> http://jquerymobile.com/test/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.css
[15:34:07] <gseguin> this one has comments
[15:34:36] <gseguin> I know it's not the theme one, but I'm pretty sure it's fixed now
[15:34:45] <toddparker> cool, thanks
[15:34:54] <tbenzige> yeah. perfect. is there anyway to fix RC1?
[15:34:58] <tbenzige> or are we stuck with it?
[15:36:00] <gseguin> is it a big blocker?
[15:36:24] <gseguin> it's possible to do, just time to spend on it
[15:37:02] <toddparker> this might be ok for rc2
[15:37:20] <toddparker> it's mainly for people trying to import the default theme or whatever from rc1
[15:37:23] <toddparker> it won't work
[15:37:33] <toddparker> but rc1 is almost gone. hurrah for rc2
[15:37:47] <tbenzige> yeah. that might not be too bad. TR detects bad theme files
[15:37:49] <gseguin> not sure it's worth the time
[15:37:58] <toddparker> i think we're ok if this is fixed moving forward
[15:37:58] <tbenzige> so if they try, they might just find the import default theme button isntead
[15:38:06] <toddparker> rather have a download builder :)
[15:38:14] <gseguin> :P
[15:38:15] <toddparker> right. we do give them a link to do that
[15:38:49] <tbenzige> ok. thats fine. thats gseguin and toddparker for all your help
[15:39:32] <gseguin> thank you! TR is awesome! Sorry for not catching that issue earlier

[15:49:56] <LakWork> the gist of the issue is that in desktop browsers, vmousemove events do not contain a pageX or pageY property in jquery 1.7.1
[15:50:06] <LakWork> which causes all kinds of related issues
[15:51:25] <gseguin> hmm interesting
[15:52:02] <LakWork> in fact, i noticed that the vmousemove event in jquery 1.6.4 has something like 40 properties returned with it, while in 1.7.1 it's more like 20
[15:52:33] <gseguin> oh wait
[15:52:38] <kinblas> gseguin: LakWork: I fixed the pageX/pageY problem in master
[15:52:38] <gseguin> that is 1.0.1

[15:53:00] <LakWork> did not realize that :O
[15:53:09] <kinblas> yeah for 1.7.x they split out the event properties
[15:53:12] <kinblas> into sub objects
[15:53:20] <kinblas> it used to be there was one big list of event properties
[15:53:33] <kinblas> so johnbender fixed it so it was looking for the mouseprops
[15:53:50] <LakWork> awesome
[15:53:52] <kinblas> *but* there was a regexp that was looking for event types that started with "mouse"
[15:53:59] <kinblas> but obviously "click" doesn't start with "mouse"
[15:54:08] <kinblas> so I tweaked the regex on MASTER
[15:54:32] <kinblas> LakWork: it's a one-liner if you want to patch your local copy
[15:54:35] <LakWork> as developers, do you guys have any insight on when we might see full page overlays
[15:54:37] <LakWork> ?
[15:54:52] <LakWork> sure kinblas, that'd be helpful

[15:55:39] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by jblas (2w, 1d ago): Fix for issue #3815 - vclick events don't have pageX/pageY defined on them  - Modified createVirtualEvent() so that it uses the mouseHook properties if the original event type starts with "mouse" or "click". The original regex was only looking for "mouse".
[15:55:42] <gseguin> LakWork: what do you mean by full page overlays?
[15:55:58] <LakWork> like this, but not fucking horrible: http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-SimpleDialog/demos2/blank.html
[15:56:29] <kinblas> oh heh, you mean where you can see the page that invoked the dialog?
[15:56:34] <LakWork> yes
[15:56:38] * kinblas defers to scott and todd
[15:56:39] <gseguin> yes
[15:57:19] <LakWork> our design team, the delightful group of ladies that they are, don't like jquerymobile's stock dialogs and they want that style instead :)
[15:57:27] <gseguin> we're working on it in the https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/popup-widget branch
[15:58:09] <LakWork> excellent gseguin i will check that out
[15:58:26] <gseguin> you can try it out there: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[15:58:57] <LakWork> oh that's very nice!
[15:59:58] <LakWork> realistically, how far is that from "stable" ?
[16:00:08] <LakWork> because it's exactly what we need
[16:00:25] <gseguin> it's not far from stable but it won't be in 1.1
[16:00:32] <LakWork> fair enough
[16:00:49] <gseguin> it's definitely in active development though
[16:00:51] <gseguin> gotta go
[16:00:54] <gseguin> sorry
[16:00:58] <LakWork> okay, thanks gseguin i appreciate your help
[16:01:08] <gseguin> be back in 30min
[16:01:13] <LakWork> the #jquerymobile channel is horrible awful place and i'm glad i found some people in here
[16:02:33] <LakWork> kinblas where's the patch i need for supporting events?
[16:02:34] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Liked the slide transition from jQuery Mobile 1.0? We heard you. For RC2: slide (like 1.0) and slidefade (1.1 style) - http://t.co/mQapMIlP ★ http://bit.ly/HpkLvd
[16:04:23] <LakWork> also, aside from events. what else does not work in 1.7.1? Unfortunately for me I've spent the last 6 weeks building a jqm site using 1.7.1 and 1.0.1 and it's too late to downgrade jquery
[16:29:27] <LakWork> kinblas you here?
[16:29:37] <kinblas> LakWork: sorry just got out of a meeting
