[08:43:59] <toddparker> Hi everyone
[08:44:04] <toddparker> hope you had a nice weekend
[08:46:32] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:48:54] <uGoMobi> hi guys, good morning
[08:52:19] <toddparker> hi gseguin and uGoMobi
[08:52:25] <toddparker> is _|Nix|_ in the house?
[08:52:33] <toddparker> Question re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4484#issuecomment-6242271
[08:52:34] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4484 on jquery-mobile (uGoMobi; 1w, 2d ago): Popup widget: popups not accessible by keyboard
[08:52:46] <toddparker> "the popup uses its own button generation and click handling. We may want to integrate popup with the core click router."
[08:54:14] <toddparker> wondering what that really means. Seems like this would just be a different click handler to open a popup…not sure why button generation (buttonMarkup) would be impacted
[09:01:39] <johnbender> buenos dias
[09:26:20] <toddparker> hi johnbender
[09:26:31] <johnbender> toddparker: yo
[09:26:39] <johnbender> back into the prs and issues today
[09:26:44] <johnbender> I'm also going to get started on the readme
[09:27:09] <johnbender> sprinkled with a bit of help for the ui folks getting the junit output from their test builds
[09:29:01] <johnbender> scottjehl: now you've gotten me all excited for the end of the month
[09:29:28] <johnbender> Gon' lurn yew sum mayths boy!
[09:30:35] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Hey! I already made that change (i.e. popup uses the central click handler).
[09:30:46] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'm having one problem though, and that's with focus.
[09:31:03] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I can't figure out how to close the popup when it loses focus.
[09:33:39] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The problem before was that focus remained on the page behind the popup. I figured out how to get rid of that, but if we don't close the popup when it loses focus, you can end up tabbing to a widget behind the popup.
[09:34:12] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, we took care of the mouse with the overlay, but we left out the keyboard.
[09:37:28] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: one thing you can do is try to force tab focus within the popup
[10:25:20] <toddparker> johnbender, gseguin, JasonDScott  - RIM checkin today
[10:25:22] <toddparker> right?
[10:25:47] <johnbender> toddparker: yah I've got it at 11
[10:34:55] <gseguin> toddparker: can't make it today
[10:46:37] <toddparker> no problem gseguin
[10:46:44] <toddparker> johnbender: talk to you then
[10:46:48] <johnbender> toddparker: kk
[10:49:00] <JasonDScott> toddparker: Yes, as far as I know.
[10:53:56] <toddparker> ok, sounds good
[10:56:34] <MauriceG> Hi! Hope everybody is fine?
[10:56:36] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: hi Jason, can you test a fix for that navbar issue on BB5?
[10:56:43] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[11:00:12] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Yes
[11:00:31] <toddparker> hi MauriceG
[11:00:34] <johnbender> toddparker: I might be a bit late to the call I have to deal with my daugher
[11:00:37] <johnbender> *daughter
[11:02:02] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: http://ugomobi.github.com/navbar/navbar-new.html
[11:02:47] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: can you check of any wrapping occurs
[11:02:51] <toddparker> ok johnbender
[11:03:04] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: I will try it out when I get back to my desk, just in a meeting now.
[11:03:11] <toddparker> love your test pages uGoMobi
[11:03:18] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: ok cool, thanks!
[11:03:29] <uGoMobi> toddparker: even the ugly red? ;-)
[11:03:31] <toddparker> btw - did you add your test pages to the docs somewhere in a folder?
[11:03:35] <toddparker> and link 'em up
[11:03:46] <toddparker> yeah, red is good to see gaps
[11:03:52] <uGoMobi> toddparker: indeed
[11:04:12] <uGoMobi> toddparker: no not yet, need to make some changes before we can use them there
[11:05:38] <toddparker> yeah, makes sense
[11:05:50] <toddparker> no need for the "CUrrently" buttons and such
[11:05:58] <uGoMobi> just few minor things so can do that any time soon
[11:06:22] <uGoMobi> yes and make them more "general"
[11:08:45] <uGoMobi> toddparker: what do you think about having JS add mini to components in header/footer instead of so many specific css rules?
[11:09:23] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ... and the need to override them (see navbar button which get wrong padding in toolbar for example)
[11:38:54] <toddparker> JasonDScott: do you see issues with radios and checks on the form page in BB10?
[11:39:11] <toddparker> the seem to work for the first 2-3 clicks, then stop responding
[11:40:43] <johnbender> toddparker: we still don't support query params to embedded pages correct?
[11:48:29] <JasonDScott> toddparker: does it only happen when you have some horizontal movement to your click?
[11:48:40] <JasonDScott> vertical*
[11:54:59] <johnbender> sweet moses
[11:55:04] <johnbender> that one took a long time to close
[11:57:11] <johnbender> well
[11:57:17] <johnbender> as though there was ever a doubt
[11:57:26] <johnbender> the new MBPs look mighty spiffy
[11:57:48] <johnbender> my only consolation is that there's going to be a (hopefully) legit thinkpad ultrabook sometime in the near future
[11:58:03] <johnbender> if the battery life is good it could "totes change muh life brah"
[11:58:35] <johnbender> Wilto: toddparker: gseguin: scottjehl: AKA the Apple Fanboi Squad
[11:58:37] <johnbender> :P
[11:58:40] * johnbender runs to hide
[11:58:46] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:00:32] <johnbender> I'm actually considering the possibility of buying one of those things just to run linux
[12:00:35] <johnbender> feels like sacrelige
[12:00:48] <johnbender> better hardware is slowly overtaking my "priniciples"
[12:01:02] <johnbender> principles even :/
[12:01:20] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: odd number ( > 1) of nav items wrap, even is good.
[12:02:10] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: ok thanks, will adjust the % for 3 and 5 then
[12:10:29] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: I tweaked the percentages a little... can you check again? can you tell me if the title and paragraph text become green or red
[12:10:57] <toddparker> JasonDScott: not really, it seems to be an issue no matter how carefully i click
[12:11:26] <toddparker> might be better if you can try out the form gallery and other other widgets on your newer build
[12:11:54] <toddparker> c'mon johnbender - admint apple makes the best hardware
[12:12:10] <toddparker> you're going to have to want 1-2 years to get a thinkpad with retina
[12:12:11] <johnbender> toddparker: the new mbps are pretty damn nice
[12:12:16] <johnbender> toddparker: true
[12:12:17] <JasonDScott> Odd rows > 1, still don't work. <p> is green
[12:12:25] <johnbender> if it ever happens at al
[12:12:27] <johnbender> *all
[12:12:29] <toddparker> yeah
[12:12:35] <toddparker> need your OS to be ready
[12:12:45] <toddparker> think apple's been working on that for years in secret
[12:12:45] <johnbender> toddparker: although I'd take the extended battery life over the extra pixels right now
[12:13:12] <toddparker> that's why you need an Air :p
[12:13:29] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: thanks, turns out BB5 does support CSS3 selectors... this fix works for IE7 but not for BB5 then... have to think of something else :(
[12:13:39] <toddparker> for every problem, there is an apple product i will suggets
[12:14:05] <johnbender> toddparker: the new X1 looks really nice
[12:14:15] <johnbender> has a better resolution than the air, unless they got retinas today too :/
[12:14:30] <johnbender> thin, light, and in theory should have really nice battery life
[12:14:37] <johnbender> to which I say, TAKE MY MONEY
[12:15:00] <toddparker> that is spiffy
[12:15:04] * johnbender is mostly lying he's being very frugal in preperation for possible grad school spending
[12:16:29] <johnbender> toddparker:
[12:16:30] <johnbender> http://mashable.com/2012/05/15/lenovo-x1-carbon/#64121Open-Facing-Right
[12:16:37] <johnbender> it's got the hinge I've been longing for too
[12:16:40] * johnbender drools
[12:16:58] <johnbender> x1 + xmonad == xrated!
[12:17:03] * johnbender goes to twitter
[12:17:09] <johnbender> hmm
[12:17:20] <johnbender> need another x in there for a XXX acronym
[12:17:24] * johnbender noodles
[12:17:31] <johnbender> xwindows?
[12:17:31] <johnbender> lol
[12:17:32] <johnbender> x11
[12:37:25] <johnbender> toddparker: do you have the issue template we use on jsbin handy?
[12:37:31] <johnbender> I'm working on the README
[12:52:48] <agcolom> Good evening everyone!
[12:54:58] <agcolom> is gseguin around?
[13:02:11] <agcolom> toddparker??
[13:14:05] <gseguin> agcolom: I'm here
[13:14:09] <gseguin> 'sup?
[13:14:25] <agcolom> Hi,  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/37130102654b1b05f9e69320db60b480d2abeaba#docs/content/content-collapsible-options.html is not in 1.1-stable. Should it be there or is it only for 1.2?
[13:14:27] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (1m, 3w ago): Merge pull request #3821 from jakeboone02/custom-collapsible-icons  Custom collapsible icons
[13:14:50] <agcolom> (so I couldn't cheerry pick my changes...)
[13:15:05] * gseguin checks
[13:16:45] <gseguin> agcolom: it's not a bug fix to me
[13:16:56] <agcolom> ok, so 1.2 then?
[13:16:58] <gseguin> therefore it does not belong in 1.1-stable
[13:17:03] <agcolom> ok
[13:17:52] <agcolom> Merci :-)
[13:18:06] <gseguin> de rien
[13:18:39] <agcolom> is toddparker around??
[13:18:58] <gseguin> was here this morning (Pacific time)
[13:20:10] <agcolom> btw, I have prepared the dialog page (looked at the js to get the methods, events and options... ) Hope I got it right... so you no longer need to reply to my post on Basecamp
[13:40:14] <johnbender> toddparker: gseguin: Wilto: scottjehl: agcolom: uGoMobi: https://gist.github.com/767eb1abc653fa5bc6b1
[13:40:29] <johnbender> that's what I have finished so far on the readme
[13:40:31] <johnbender> no spell checking
[13:40:33] <johnbender> or proof reading
[13:40:37] <johnbender> but it's getting there
[13:41:51] <johnbender> I figure we can direct people at both the github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/README.md#issues
[13:41:55] <johnbender> and the same for pull requests
[13:43:56] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm expecting to add a link at some point to the builder in the Build section :D
[13:48:25] <agcolom> johnbender: the presentation looks really good! Will read in detail now ;-)
[13:48:27] <toddparker> agcolom: here i am
[13:48:30] <toddparker> marathon meetings
[13:49:08] <toddparker> johnbender: this is my latest jsbin template - http://jsbin.com/ufiver/edit
[13:49:11] <agcolom> hi! I was after some advice regarding the api docs
[13:49:14] <toddparker> double check it
[13:49:18] <toddparker> sure agcolom
[13:50:09] <agcolom> toddparker, your jsbin has the multiple double quote: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale="1"">
[13:50:47] <agcolom> the docs go <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
[13:51:21] <agcolom> the api docs. How much info goes in it? For example, take collapsibles...
[13:51:43] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible.html
[13:51:51] <toddparker> agcolom: removed those double quotes
[13:51:59] <toddparker> i think it's technically ok, but ugly as hell
[13:53:12] <agcolom> should the api docs have everything from that page or just the part before Expanding collapsibles on load
[13:53:52] <toddparker> I think everything
[13:54:01] <toddparker> unless we want to break some of that into a new section
[13:54:14] <toddparker> we could for example do a theming section, like methods or options
[13:54:45] <toddparker> that gives an overview of the widget classes, shows how to use swatches, walks thru customization options
[13:54:53] <toddparker> think i like that
[13:54:55] <agcolom> I think I'm happy with everything from it. So I'll just have to add that
[13:55:21] <toddparker> but feel free to improve/re-org as you gp
[13:55:22] <toddparker> go
[13:55:35] <agcolom> yes, that's my view too... So I just wanted to check with you before I do more...
[13:56:09] <agcolom> Are we going to keep our current docs as well? (I like the fact that it works well on mobile)
[13:56:17] <agcolom> and it looks nice...
[13:58:42] <agcolom> btw congratulations, Boston Globe is shortlisted for the Critters 2012 (London 20th June) http://www.ubelly.com/2012/04/the-critters-2012-shortlist/
[13:59:32] <uGoMobi> johnbender: readme looks good! two comments: issues > browsers + platform(s) & Avoid merge commits > not really clear what it means (what do i have to do to avoid what?)
[14:04:02] <uGoMobi> johnbender: better link to this JSBin issue template http://jsbin.com/awoluv/edit#html of agcolom
[14:04:41] <uGoMobi> the one toddparker posted has a typo in the viewport meta tag
[14:05:09] <agcolom> johnbender: end of Requirements opperating system (one p)
[14:08:07] <agcolom> johnbender: in commands whereever (one e)
[14:09:38] <agcolom> johnbender: windows (not sure, but a verb may be missing)
[14:13:05] <johnbender> agcolom: uGoMobi: cool, I'll steal the jsbin link and I'll ping you guys about proofreading once I've gone through muhself
[14:13:08] <johnbender> it's in flux
[14:13:15] <johnbender> then we can do feedback in the comments
[14:13:45] <agcolom> great!
[14:13:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, sorry I thought you wanted me to give it a look now
[14:13:55] <agcolom> me too ;-)
[14:14:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: agcolom: yah sorry my fault
[14:14:10] <johnbender> thanks for the feedback so far though :D
[14:14:33] <uGoMobi> any time
[14:14:36] <uGoMobi> :-)
[14:15:11] <johnbender> uGoMobi: and I do need to expand on the merge commits issue, but I'm not sure whether that's in scope for the readme :(
[14:15:14] <johnbender> maybe I can find a link
[14:15:20] <johnbender> on rebase vs merge or some such
[14:16:22] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, will give it another look when you are done
[14:18:05] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone... new resolution for the week, do not go to bed at midnight... I need more than 6h sleep! Have a great end of the day...
[14:18:20] <uGoMobi> good night Anne
[14:18:44] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper
[14:19:16] <johnbender> agcolom: gnight! Also, sleep is overrated
[14:19:18] <johnbender> :D
[14:20:25] <agcolom> I just wish my daughter didn't need to get up so early (6.45) or can't wait for her to get up by herself!
[14:23:21] <agcolom> toddparker one last question if you are around.... I've done dialogs, collapsibles, collapsible sets... (I'll add more details to those as discussed today). Any preference for the next ones... the choice is lists or form elements...
[14:27:44] <toddparker> good night Anne
[14:28:02] <toddparker> maybe a form element?
[14:28:07] <toddparker> like a slider
[14:28:09] <agcolom> ok
[14:28:16] <agcolom> slider sounds good...
[14:28:19] <toddparker> or selects since we have the custom select option?
[14:28:27] <toddparker> that was fast!
[14:28:35] <toddparker> you have all those already in XML?
[14:28:52] <agcolom> I have the 3 in XML, yes,
[14:29:02] <toddparker> i definitely want to take the opportunity to re-think the docs organization and design
[14:29:09] <agcolom> ok
[14:29:23] <toddparker> but that is easy when things are in XML
[14:29:35] <toddparker> great work Anne
[14:29:50] <agcolom> yes, definitely... the trick is with the demos... not sure yet how to do them
[14:29:52] <agcolom> thanks
[14:30:15] <agcolom> because if we want to show demos, we need JQM...
[14:31:11] <agcolom> now there may be things in the code such as list items that should be 'normal' and not enhanced... so we need to distinguish between all that
[14:31:28] <agcolom> and we want only the demo section to have the JQM enhancement...
[14:33:10] <agcolom> If your system is setup with the correct etc/hosts, you can view what I've done at http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com
[14:33:28] <toddparker> Ah, I see
[14:33:54] <agcolom> Can you see it?
[14:33:55] <toddparker> maybe we can assign a class to inline demos and hide them if not in jQM?
[14:34:01] <toddparker> nope
[14:34:11] <toddparker> i think i need to set up my hosts file
[14:34:20] <agcolom> yes you do.
[14:36:05] <agcolom> The jQuery UI demos are not there either, so I'll see how they do it, and try and do something similar... unless I get inspired in the next few days ;-)
[14:37:38] <agcolom> When I look at UI, they have a demo tab, so maybe the demos will all be on a separate page, in which case we don't really have a problem...
[14:40:29] <agcolom> Ok, this time I am going to bed! Goodnight again, and have a great afternoon/evening...
[15:09:01] <toddparker> i'd hate to love the ability to have inline demos, but we'll see
[16:51:16] <johnbender> would anyone be really hurt if I removed the test suite aggregated at /test/unit/index.html?
[16:51:24] <johnbender> *tests/unit/index.html
[16:51:37] <johnbender> I'd rather we run the phantom tests or each test page individually
