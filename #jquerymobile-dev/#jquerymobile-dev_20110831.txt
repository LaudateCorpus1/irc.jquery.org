[07:12:20] <scottjehl_> heyall
[07:12:34] <toddparker> hey scottjehl
[07:12:43] <toddparker> scottjehl_
[07:12:48] <toddparker> tricky with that _
[07:12:58] <scottjehl_> ugh
[07:13:10] <scottjehl_> probably logged in somewhere else too
[07:13:15] <miketaylr> just use tab name competion :)
[07:13:26] <miketaylr> completion, even
[07:13:38] <toddparker> how does that work miketaylr?
[07:13:42] <toddparker> I'm an IRC n00b
[07:13:44] <miketaylr> try sc<tab>
[07:14:01] <miketaylr> or just s<tab>
[07:14:07] <miketaylr> should autocomplete the name
[07:23:33] <scottjehl_> apparently if I sign on in more than one machine without signing out I get the underscore
[07:26:38] <miketaylr> you can also just /nick scottjehl to fix that
[07:26:55] <miketaylr> unless the other guy is still online, then you have to ghost him outta town
[07:26:58] <scottjehl> BAM
[07:27:01] <miketaylr> :D
[07:29:10] <toddparker> miketaylr: wowie!
[07:29:19] <toddparker> i've been typing it out each time
[07:29:21] <toddparker> boo
[07:29:36] <miketaylr> just think, productivity will be up like 0.000000001%
[07:29:44] <toddparker> you saved me a lot of typing
[07:29:49] <toddparker> i'll send a fruit basket
[07:29:51] <miketaylr> haha
[07:29:52] <miketaylr> thx
[07:30:09] <toddparker> best tip i've heard in weeks
[07:30:12] <miketaylr> i'm going to oslo tonight, so hold off for a while
[07:30:19] <toddparker> will do
[07:30:24] <toddparker> cancelling order
[07:30:59] <toddparker> random question guys: shoudl we ajaxify imagemap "links" in addition to anchors in jQM?
[07:35:12] <toddparker> yeah, i was using imagemaps so what :)
[07:35:16] <toddparker> (prototype)
[08:19:19] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:48:48] <_nickel> OHYAH!
[08:48:58] <_nickel> toddparker: so, for that android select issue
[08:49:04] <_nickel> actually one sec
[08:49:07] <_nickel> I want to try it first :D
[08:49:20] <_nickel> I was going to try something and then got caught responding to new issues
[08:55:33] <_nickel> toddparker: adding display: inline to the .ui-mobile-viewport seems to fix this android isue
[08:55:36] <_nickel> *issue
[08:55:40] <_nickel> as I mentioned in that bug
[08:57:41] <_nickel> toddparker: wondering if you can think of any issues with that since I think the expectation was that the body would be the mobile viewport in most cases and thats inline already
[08:57:45] <_nickel> scottjehl: ^
[09:01:36] <toddparker> I can't think of an issue with that, but we'll need to test
[09:01:53] <toddparker> can you email scott with thsi Q since he's traveling and may not see this?
[09:02:04] <_nickel> toddparker: yah buddy!
[09:02:45] <_nickel> toddparker: if I reference him in a comment on the issue you think he'll get it?
[09:02:50] <_nickel> 2 birds
[09:22:23] <gseguin> toddparker: ping
[09:22:43] <gseguin> toddparker: I'm looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2363
[09:22:44] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-mobile by jgable (20h, 44m ago): Fix for custom select menu dynamic items not refreshed properly
[09:23:13] <gseguin> I have a "cleaner" fix but now I wonder what the good behaviour is
[09:24:07] <gseguin> should selected options actually have ui-btn-active ?
[09:31:30] <toddparker> thanks _nickel
[09:32:07] <toddparker> gseguin: when you say "selected" options, at what point in the interaction?
[09:32:37] <gseguin> toddparker: open the jsfiddle in the pull request
[09:32:49] <toddparker> this should follow the new checkbox style IMHO
[09:33:02] <gseguin> that's what I thought too
[09:33:09] <toddparker> yeah, i don't like the full row active state except for a single seelct where it closes
[09:33:19] <toddparker> b/c that is more like a list view
[09:33:24] <toddparker> yeah, you're right
[09:33:52] <gseguin> alright, I'll find out how to do it
[09:33:56] <gseguin> thanks
[09:41:40] <gseguin> toddparker: last thing on that
[09:42:04] <gseguin> should the background of the selected state be blue?
[09:59:04] <toddparker> is this in the multi-select still?
[09:59:13] <toddparker> gseguin ^^
[09:59:31] <toddparker> if so, no. only the checkbox should toggle on/off
[10:01:46] <gseguin> toddparker: yes
[10:05:29] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: hey you guys take a look at http://app.ft.com yet?
[10:06:04] <toddparker> oh, yeah
[10:06:08] <kinblas> in terms of transitions, they are actually doing that trick we tried a while back
[10:06:14] <toddparker> that was a hot topic at the globe when it launched
[10:06:19] <toddparker> what's that?
[10:06:29] <kinblas> where the page is scrolled down towards the bottom
[10:06:44] <kinblas> they either translate the page coming in down to that same scroll position
[10:07:01] <kinblas> and then reset the scroll to top and translate to (0,0) when done
[10:07:26] <kinblas> or translate the outgoing one down by the scroll offset, and then set scroll top to 0
[10:07:47] <kinblas> it doesnt seem to flash that much ... when we tried it ... iOS3 was the current OS
[10:08:01] <kinblas> in fact they want you to use iOS4
[10:08:54] <kinblas> anyways, if you recall I tried that, and I think scott did too separately, but we abandoned that approach because of all the flashing/blinking
[10:09:14] <kinblas> I do see flashing on their site ocassionally and also on the desktop
[10:09:28] <toddparker> yeah, that was promising, but blinky me thinks
[10:09:45] <kinblas> toddparker: the other thing
[10:09:50] <kinblas> they *NEVER*
[10:09:54] <toddparker> scott tried this a few different ways - where the translate happened and it was blinky
[10:09:55] <kinblas> display: none their pages
[10:09:59] <toddparker> worth another look if you want
[10:10:01] <kinblas> they just translate offscreen
[10:10:12] <toddparker> huh
[10:10:15] <toddparker> interesting
[10:10:25] <kinblas> toddparker: I was talking to scottjehl about that the other day
[10:10:29] <toddparker> the issue with that is on a screenreader, they are still there
[10:10:39] <kinblas> because that is the *ONLY* way we can stop blinking on honeycomb
[10:10:43] <toddparker> so could we translate offscreen, then display none later?
[10:10:45] <kinblas> or at least the XOOM
[10:10:54] <kinblas> toddparker: no that doesn't work
[10:10:57] <kinblas> it *ALWAYS* blinks
[10:10:59] <toddparker> bummer
[10:11:03] <toddparker> wtf
[10:11:18] <kinblas> I think it blinks because it thinks it has to redraw *ALL* abs pos elements
[10:11:20] <kinblas> on the screen
[10:11:31] <kinblas> it doesn't blink if things are in the flow
[10:11:34] <toddparker> maybe it's a bit less of an issue now that we nuke pages from teh dom, accessbility wise
[10:11:42] <kinblas> this is the $@$#% that's been slowing me down
[10:11:46] <kinblas> trying to figure out this stuff
[10:12:00] <toddparker> we could prevent tabbing into offscreen pages and keep them visible instead of hiding
[10:12:22] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah accesibility was the only thing scott and I were worried about
[10:12:24] <toddparker> as long as blind users aren't listening to pages that are "gone" that could work
[10:12:37] <toddparker> but if you can't navigate there, maybe it's ok?
[10:12:51] <toddparker> think people navigate by headign and such
[10:13:02] <toddparker> and those may show up in this case, if not hidden
[10:13:31] <toddparker> why don't you try and make this work as well as you can, then if we have positive results, we can look at ways to make the accessibility work
[10:13:53] <kinblas> toddparker: maybe I can branch the branch
[10:13:53] <toddparker> i *really* want to get rid of that jump
[10:13:57] <toddparker> heh
[10:13:59] <toddparker> yeah
[10:14:15] <kinblas> toddparker: and of course there is the issue that folks can turn domCache back on
[10:14:30] <kinblas> toddparker: just an fyi ft.com uses a page flipping approach
[10:14:33] <toddparker> sure, that too
[10:14:35] <kinblas> they only ever have 3 pages
[10:14:54] <kinblas> they dynamically re-write the page they are going to
[10:14:56] <toddparker> and the rest of the data is just in memory?
[10:15:02] <kinblas> so they are just switching between the same set of 3 pages
[10:15:09] <toddparker> do they use fake scrolling?
[10:15:19] <kinblas> they are using touchscroll
[10:15:21] <toddparker> or are they using the same viewport, like us
[10:15:33] <kinblas> but I think for sub page stuff
[10:15:34] <toddparker> ah, well that may be the real reason for smoothness
[10:15:37] <kinblas> otherwise its native
[10:15:44] <toddparker> oh, promosing
[10:15:47] <toddparker> do it!
[10:16:02] <kinblas> toddparker: hard to tell actually, if I load in Safari desktop with
[10:16:09] <kinblas> ipad user agent
[10:16:13] <kinblas> I see the scrollbar
[10:16:27] <kinblas> if I use it, it still does the right thing
[10:16:34] <kinblas> so I don't think they are using touchscroll on the top-level
[10:16:38] <toddparker> but does this work on ipad or just iphone?
[10:16:53] <kinblas> supposedly both ... I haven't tried ipod yet
[10:17:00] * kinblas gives it a go
[10:17:27] <kinblas> toddparker: also, their site only works on ios
[10:17:49] <toddparker> crashed my 3.2 ipad the first load
[10:17:51] <toddparker> re-trying
[10:18:07] <kinblas> lol
[10:18:09] <toddparker> yep, works
[10:18:23] <kinblas> that's how you can tell they are using too many translate3d or transition-style props
[10:18:26] <kinblas> they run out of memory
[10:18:30] <toddparker> scrolling feels super fake to me
[10:18:44] <kinblas> heh it crashed my ipod safari
[10:18:49] <kinblas> on load
[10:19:07] <toddparker> it's really heavy
[10:19:14] <toddparker> ast time i tried on 3g, it failed to load
[10:19:35] <toddparker> other than avoiding hte app store, this is *not* how you do HTML5 "web apps"
[10:19:46] <kinblas> yeah on the ipod the scrolling is fake
[10:20:25] <toddparker> my top of the page is garbled too
[10:20:33] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah so on ipod, it's obvious their page sizes are exactly the viewport size and they are using touchscroll
[10:20:57] <toddparker> yeah
[10:21:09] <toddparker> you an try the translate trick and see if you have better luck
[10:21:18] <toddparker> maybe the display:none was hurting us there
[10:21:22] <toddparker> worht a shot
[10:21:25] <kinblas> toddparker: I do see it doing that trick on the desktop though
[10:22:07] <kinblas> toddparker: right now I'm trying to figure out why regular slide does not work on Android 2.2 (HTC Incredible)
[10:22:34] <toddparker> this is slick, but it's a hot mess. unresponsive taps, broken stuff
[10:23:01] <kinblas> it works everywhere except there ... the HTC seems to be a bit more finnicky or maybe buggy in terms of the CSS rules that get applied
[10:23:31] <toddparker> i have the same device to test
[10:24:23] <toddparker> what are you testing, branch-wise
[10:26:03] <kinblas> toddparker: you mean what available tree?
[10:26:14] * kinblas tries to get the short url
[10:26:47] <kinblas> toddparker: the current transitions branch is here: http://bit.ly/r2dJmB
[10:28:28] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: so another thing I've found that in order to smooth things out on honeycomb (Xoom) we actually have to make the page that doesn't animate in some of our transitions ... use translate3d() trick
[10:29:26] <kinblas> the thing is that this introduces more CSS as I have to specify every target selector permutation to make sure things are properly evaluated
[10:29:41] <kinblas> I think to make things simpler, I'm going to have to introduce a  'forward' class
[10:29:46] <kinblas> the reason is that
[10:30:03] <kinblas> rules that apply to .slide.in
[10:30:13] <kinblas> also apply to .slide.in.reverse
[10:30:21] <kinblas> for obvious reasons
[10:30:43] <kinblas> which forces me to be very verbose/explicit with target selectors to avoid unexpected things
[10:30:52] <kinblas> if we just introduced an equivalent forward
[10:30:59] <kinblas> then we could reduce things a bit
[10:32:00] <toddparker> that seems reasonable
[10:32:12] <toddparker> will this cause some memory issues
[10:32:35] <toddparker> since you're applying the 3d on all pages?
[10:32:43] <kinblas> toddparker: no just the pages in transition
[10:35:45] <toddparker> gotcha
[10:36:04] <toddparker> does all these tweaks make it better on iOS or Android or just honeycomb
[10:37:24] <kinblas> iOS is rarely the problem
[10:37:49] <kinblas> it makes things better on Android 2.2 (Incredible) and 3.1 (Xoom)
[10:38:05] * kinblas notes he only has one device for each OS version
[10:38:44] <kinblas> so for example I can't tell if the problems I'm seeing on Incredible are general 2.2 problems, or just an HTC implementation problem.
[10:39:06] <kinblas> so I'm assuming they need to try and be fixed
[10:39:19] <kinblas> toddparker: that's why its good to have a testing partner with other devices
[10:39:32] <kinblas> I need an external assesment
[10:39:38] <kinblas> (meaning someone else not me)
[11:26:47] <gseguin> toddparker: so if I want to be consistent on the styling, selects that are NOT multiple should also display that ui-icon-checkbox-on on their selected element
[11:27:25] <gseguin> this was why we were using ui-btn-active
[11:50:53] <_nickel> kinblas: making good progress on the ci server
[11:51:11] <_nickel> luckily the chef recipes were mostly servicable
[11:51:18] <_nickel> stoping for lunch
[11:56:47] <kinblas> great!
[11:59:10] <_nickel> kinblas: I also made a virtual appliance for other ubuntu server projects
[11:59:49] <kinblas> _nickel: I wish I knew what that meant. ;-P
[12:00:06] <_nickel> kinblas: its got chef installed
[12:00:14] <_nickel> so no more install process necessary
[12:00:24] <_nickel> just fire up based on the appliance I believe
[12:00:30] <_nickel> my vmware knowledge is minimal  though
[12:24:31] <toddparker> gseguin: A single sect custom menu should not have a checkbox and should get the item-row active state
[12:25:11] <toddparker> because these are sort of like listviews - you get a row active state, then they go somewhere (and we pull off the active state)
[12:25:44] <toddparker> the checkbox is more like a grouping of checkboxes so it makes sense that the checkbox element, not the row lights up
[12:25:51] <toddparker> think that seems consistent
[13:15:20] <toddparker> _nickel - this is a pretty bad bug. can you take a look? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2368
[13:15:21] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #2368 on jquery-mobile, reported by kirk911 (4h, 2m ago): pagecreate event fire multiple times
[13:18:50] <_nickel> toddparker: yes
[13:29:22] <toddparker> thanks
[13:32:55] <_nickel> toddparker: thats because we're not storing the pages in the dom
[13:33:30] <_nickel> toddparker: hmm or at least I think so
[13:38:36] <_nickel> toddparker: I asked him to try it with the domCache enabled
[14:33:52] <scottjehl> hey folks
[14:34:31] <scottjehl> _nickel toddparker that bug may just be the new expected behavior actually
[14:35:08] <gseguin> hey scottjehl
[14:35:17] <gseguin> got a question on listview
[14:35:34] <scottjehl> we just happen to create pages more often now that we remove them from the DOM. It shouldn't change the fact that they have specific handling for pagecreate vs pageshow, even if create fires more often
[14:35:44] <scottjehl> gseguin what's up!
[14:36:16] <gseguin> in listview code we do .closest( ".ui-page" )
[14:36:21] <gseguin> several times
[14:36:47] <gseguin> can we do .closest( ":jqmData(role=page)" ) instead ?
[14:37:00] <gseguin> or is there a reason it's that way?
[14:40:08] <scottjehl> umm
[14:40:44] <scottjehl> more concise? uses getElemsByClassName?
[14:40:48] <scottjehl> (faster?)
[14:40:59] <scottjehl> not sure - what's the benefit if we change that?
[14:41:48] <gseguin> so we were running into a case where we were dynamically adding elements to a listview on a page that hadn't been show yet
[14:42:22] <gseguin> and after adding the list items calling the listview() constructor or the listview(" refresh")
[14:42:28] <gseguin> and that throws
[14:43:19] <gseguin> because the parent page had not been enhanced yet
[14:43:39] <gseguin> so .closest( ".ui-page" ).length === 0
[14:43:53] <scottjehl> ah. hmm yeah
[14:47:15] <scottjehl> guess I'm impartial. I will say this affects a ton of plugins
[14:47:24] <scottjehl> as in, I think they all do this, not just listview
[14:48:33] <gseguin> ok, so the asumption is that you can't enhance components in a page that hasn't been enhanced yet
[14:48:48] <gseguin> BTW http://jsperf.com/jquery-class-selector-vs-jquery-data-selector/2
[14:50:32] <kinblas> gseguin: doesn't that jsperf agree with scottjehl's statements above?
[14:50:43] <kinblas> why is someone refreshing a listview in a page that hasn't been enhanced yet?
[14:50:46] <gseguin> somewhat yes
[14:50:53] <kinblas> Is this an ordering problem?
[14:51:03] <kinblas> as in .. perhaps page should always enhance before other items
[14:51:14] <gseguin> kinblas: doing things in the background
[14:51:27] <gseguin> pre-populating a page
[14:51:46] <kinblas> ??
[14:51:53] <gseguin> but that code should also work once the page has been enhanced
[14:52:08] <kinblas> pre-populating, and pre-enhancing?
[14:52:14] <gseguin> in our case
[14:52:19] <_nickel> scottjehl: I agree
[14:52:25] <gseguin> the page is a Backbone view
[14:52:30] <_nickel> just verifying with him thats the cause
[14:52:37] <gseguin> so when the model changes the view gets updated
[14:53:02] <_nickel> scottjehl: did you see that android fix
[14:53:07] <gseguin> and the view doesn't know if the page has been enhanced yet
[14:53:21] <_nickel> scottjehl: I want to land it but I want to verify making the `display: inline` isn't going to hose things
[14:53:31] <_nickel> scottjehl: that is the android select menu bug
[14:53:47] <kinblas> gseguin: hmmm, isn't there an associated view for the page itself?
[14:54:13] <gseguin> kinblas: sorry I missed one thing
[14:54:29] <gseguin> kinblas: the page view has nested views
[14:54:39] <gseguin> one of them being a listview
[14:54:39] <kinblas> right
[14:54:57] <gseguin> when the model linked to the listview changes
[14:55:01] <kinblas> so in backbone, the views update bottom up? versus top down?
[14:56:20] <gseguin> I guess that is to the implementor choice, it depends in which order you've registered your change handlers
[14:58:30] <scottjehl> related: I'm working on that hook now
[14:58:39] <scottjehl> preventDefault on changepage
[14:59:49] <_nickel> scottjehl: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2066#issuecomment-1958790
[14:59:50] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #2066 on jquery-mobile, reported by ryantofteland (1m, 2w ago): Select Menus won't open when pages are within FORM element
[14:59:52] <_nickel> two seconds
[15:00:01] <_nickel> my fix is at the bottom
[15:00:06] <_nickel> and I want to land it if you don't object
[15:00:09] <_nickel> everyone else is green on it
[15:00:14] <_nickel> gseguin: you're eyes would be good too
[15:00:26] <_nickel> super small change but it affects the mobile viewport
[15:00:27] * gseguin looks
[15:00:37] <_nickel> trying to make sure I don't break something
[15:05:28] <gseguin> _nickel: so you've tried inline-block?
[15:05:37] <_nickel> gseguin: I haven't
[15:05:45] <_nickel> not sure if there's an implication there as well
[15:05:56] <_nickel> going to google then
[15:06:01] <scottjehl> checking now
[15:07:00] <scottjehl> hmmm
[15:07:07] <scottjehl> I gotta say that looks scary
[15:07:35] <_nickel> scottjehl: I agree thats why I'm asking
[15:07:53] <scottjehl> for now, perhaps we could just have form.ui-page-contain { display: inline; }
[15:08:03] <scottjehl> if that solves this particular
[15:08:19] <scottjehl> I just think there's a lot of reasons we don't want that to be inline
[15:08:30] <scottjehl> for one, it'd break the very app I'm demoing tomorrow
[15:08:32] <scottjehl> heh
[15:08:40] <_nickel> scottjehl: its not just forms thogh
[15:08:45] <_nickel> its any block level element
[15:09:33] <scottjehl> selects are disabled if they have a block-level parent?
[15:09:35] <kinblas> yeah I don't like the inline either.
[15:11:19] <kinblas> _nickel: I just read what that guy is doing, he's wrapping  the pages *INSIDE* the body with a form.
[15:11:28] <_nickel> scottjehl: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=19688
[15:11:32] <_nickel> that explains it better
[15:11:35] <_nickel> its an android bug
[15:11:36] <kinblas> does it happen in a normal case
[15:11:40] <_nickel> scottjehl: http://jsbin.com/onixay/3/edit#javascript,html
[15:11:55] <_nickel> kinblas: have to for .nET
[15:11:59] <_nickel> .NET
[15:12:04] <_nickel> ASP.NET forms
[15:12:16] <_nickel> kinblas: and again its ANY block level element
[15:12:26] <kinblas> _nickel: some of our code makes assumptions about the parent of a page
[15:12:31] <_nickel> kinblas: yep
[15:12:43] <kinblas> you can't just stick things in-between-willy-nilly
[15:13:18] <kinblas> _nickel: so that's why I was asking if this still happens in a "stock" setup, but I assume the answer is yes, given your example
[15:13:32] <scottjehl> so this is between the container and the page?
[15:13:32] <_nickel> kinblas: well the example says it all
[15:14:06] * kinblas tries to find an example in the docs
[15:16:15] <_nickel> kinblas: in the issue
[15:16:18] <kinblas> _nickel: these are native selects right?
[15:16:24] <_nickel> kinblas: yah
[15:16:29] <kinblas> _nickel: why does it work fine on my 2.2?
[15:16:41] <_nickel> kinblas: why does what work?
[15:16:50] <kinblas> I went to the selects page in the docs
[15:17:03] <kinblas> and clicked on the 2 native selects
[15:17:19] <_nickel> kinblas: http://jsbin.com/onixay/3/edit#javascript,html
[15:18:40] <kinblas> man that page needs a viewport meta
[15:18:42] <kinblas> :-)
[15:19:05] <kinblas> _nickel: I guess I was trying the selects on the docs/selects page
[15:19:15] <kinblas> is he talking about un-enhanced selects?
[15:19:27] <_nickel> http://jsbin.com/uxusix/3
[15:19:46] <_nickel> kinblas: no but its an android bug so I boiled it ALLL the way down to no jqm stuff
[15:19:49] <_nickel> it has nothing to do with jqm
[15:19:55] <_nickel> its a bug
[15:20:06] <_nickel> in android
[15:21:57] <kinblas> _nickel: I know it's not a jqm bug ... what I'm trying to do is rationalize whether or not we need to introduce that "inline" which could be problematic .. for a case that we really don't support (elements between pages and viewport)
[15:23:16] <kinblas> What I was trying to say earlier was that I tried the docs pages and the selects for some reason work there?
[15:26:12] <scottjehl> why not make the form the page container in this case?
[15:26:46] <_nickel> kinblas: sorry if I'm being terse I keep bouncing back and forth between this and fixking jenkins
[15:26:52] <kinblas> lol
[15:26:54] <_nickel> who won't be getting his christmas bonus this year
[15:27:06] <_nickel> kinblas: the selcts in the docs should be fine
[15:27:22] <_nickel> kinblas: this only happens if there's a block level as the mobile-viewport
[15:27:56] <_nickel> scottjehl: so we could just tell them they need to add that css themselves because its non standard?
[15:28:01] <_nickel> I actually like that idea
[15:28:16] <_nickel> and probably document it
[15:28:21] <scottjehl> I thought it's a global config?
[15:28:46] <_nickel> I'm not sure what you mean
[15:28:53] <_nickel> I'm missing some important fact there clearly
[15:29:18] <scottjehl> hmm not it's not I guess but here's what's odd to me
[15:29:20] <scottjehl> $.mobile.pageContainer = $pages.first().parent().addClass( "ui-mobile-viewport" );
[15:29:31] <scottjehl> it would be the form in that case, right?
[15:29:37] <_nickel> correct
[15:31:30] <scottjehl> hrm
[15:31:32] <scottjehl> confused
[15:31:34] <kinblas> I guess I'm still not sure why it works when the pagecontainer is body
[15:31:48] <kinblas> a form element by default is block, as well as body
[15:32:23] <scottjehl> unfortunately I have to jet, guys. I think the ability to use block-level props is pretty important on the page container, so I'm not sure about this fix
[15:32:32] <kinblas> which is why I asked earlier if it works in the normal case, and for some reason it does... at least in the docs.
[15:32:36] <kinblas> scottjehl: +1
[15:32:38] <scottjehl> all-day jqm workshop in the AM
[15:33:01] <_nickel> kinblas: body is an inline element from my reading
[15:33:24] <kinblas> uh that wouldn't be the case
[15:33:31] <kinblas> it contains block level elements
[15:33:33] <kinblas> http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/dtd.html
[15:33:37] <scottjehl> seems suspect
[15:33:38] <kinblas> search for ELEMENT BODY
[15:33:42] <scottjehl> k see you guys!
[15:33:45] <kinblas> it ssays %block
[15:34:06] <kinblas> that's why you can use all the block CSS properties  on it, including the ones I mentioned in the issue
[15:34:14] <_nickel> hmm thats right
[15:34:37] <_nickel> the css properties that is
[15:34:55] <_nickel> for what its worth those are the 3 conditions that I found cause the bug
[15:35:07] <kinblas> _nickel: my other worry ... is that I know browser like Mozilla treat blocks in inline as a special legacy case
[15:35:12] <kinblas> that makes the browser jump through hoops
[15:35:22] <_nickel> indeed
[15:35:23] <kinblas> and produces a non-standard layout tree
[15:35:26] <kinblas> internally
[15:35:38] <_nickel> I'm aware that block inside inline is "invalid"
[15:35:51] <kinblas> _nickel: heh I know you do :-)
[15:36:02] <kinblas> I'm just voicin' my concerns
[15:36:28] <kinblas> _nickel: so out of curiosity, did the chrome guys give you that fix?
[15:36:33] <_nickel> no
[15:36:40] <_nickel> I happened upon it
[15:36:42] <kinblas> or was it one of those hunting around for properties that hid the bug
[15:36:46] <_nickel> I tried a span
[15:36:48] <_nickel> and it worked
[15:36:52] <kinblas> ah
[15:37:06] <_nickel> on a lark
[15:37:45] * kinblas wonders if this is an event problem versus a display problem
[15:39:05] <_nickel> with android?
[15:39:50] <kinblas> yeah, like is it that it's not responding to the click?
[15:40:04] <kinblas> Or is it that it does get the click but the menu is off in la-la-land
[15:40:50] <_nickel> I didn't test binding to the native change event
[15:40:55] * kinblas notes that the widgets in webkit/safari are fake/drawn by the browser
[15:47:02] <kinblas> gseguin: I'm really hatin' transitions :-)
[15:47:59] <gseguin> kinblas: I feel your pain
[15:49:08] <kinblas> gseguin: I'm coming to the conclusion that animations are much easier to author and handle via code for page transitions
[15:50:11] <gseguin> you mean, do a JavaScript transition?
[15:52:24] <kinblas> gseguin: no
[15:52:33] <kinblas> gseguin: I just meant that with animations
[15:53:01] <kinblas> everything is nice and neat ... you bind to the animation complete and it fires a single animateComplete event
[15:53:20] <kinblas> for transitions, it fires a transitionComplete for *EVERY* property that is transitioning
[15:53:44] <gseguin> OH
[15:53:54] <kinblas> on top of that
[15:54:21] <kinblas> we have to timer stuff ... or the alternative force a reflow ... so that the initial values can take affect *BEFORE* you turn the transition on
[15:54:49] <gseguin> so you need to know how many property you're animating for each transition?
[15:55:06] <kinblas> in theory yes
[15:55:28] <kinblas> but in practice, that's not feesible because we don't know what's being transitioned for a given named-transition
[15:55:34] <kinblas> unless we crawl the CSS-OM
[15:55:38] <kinblas> which we aren't going to do
[15:56:11] <kinblas> we're at least lucky in our default transitions that all our properties transition at the same length
[15:56:22] <gseguin> oh ok
[15:56:49] <kinblas> gseguin: sorry, I'm just venting/frustrated ... it all seems so overly complicated
[15:57:06] <kinblas> and that's not even dealing with the flashing problems
[15:57:07] <gseguin> heh, that's cool
[15:57:49] <gseguin> I like to know what's going on, it's kindda hard that context switch with Jive's tasks
[15:58:04] <kinblas> heh I know what you mean
[15:58:06] <gseguin> I feel like I'm missing a lot of stuff
[15:58:19] <kinblas> I get context switches every few hours
[15:58:31] <kinblas> makes it hard to come back and figure out where youwere
[15:58:39] <gseguin> yeah that too even during my jQM days
[15:58:46] <gseguin> absolutely
[15:59:05] <gseguin> so the flashing thing is happenning only on the Xoom?
[15:59:53] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah flashing is bad there, but also the HTC Incredible was sucking for a bit, but I got that working again, except for the basic slide which I've been trying to figure out
[16:00:16] <kinblas> ios looks good
[16:00:24] <kinblas> as does the Droid-X
[16:00:40] <kinblas> though on all Androids, the transitions are laggy ... they drop frames
[16:02:21] <gseguin> and you think you'll get to solve the Xoom?
[16:02:29] <gseguin> is that a blocker for B3?
[16:04:06] <_nickel> kinblas: I'll play around a bit more and see if I can find another way around it
[16:05:12] <kinblas> gseguin: I don't know if it's a blocker, the keyframe stuff was just as bad, I at least know what the flickering is about there though.
[16:10:14] <gseguin> kinblas: I'm looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2017
[16:10:15] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #2017 on jquery-mobile, reported by arcatdmz (1m, 4w ago): activeBtnClass never be removed when Ajax link handling is disabled
[16:10:28] <gseguin> and toddparker's comment: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2017#issuecomment-1841848
[16:10:29] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #2017 on jquery-mobile, reported by arcatdmz (1m, 4w ago): activeBtnClass never be removed when Ajax link handling is disabled
[16:10:38] <gseguin> is confusing me
[16:11:45] <gseguin> should changePage be cancellable?
[16:12:10] <kinblas> gseguin: I thought you fixed that one a while ago
[16:12:18] <kinblas> that gets removed in the click handler
[16:12:40] <kinblas> it's added in vclick and removed on click
[16:13:12] <gseguin> oh he's just talking about state
[16:13:34] <gseguin> no it's not fixed but if it's just visual state, then it shouldn't be too hard
[16:16:56] <gseguin> gotta go, will talk to you tomorrow
