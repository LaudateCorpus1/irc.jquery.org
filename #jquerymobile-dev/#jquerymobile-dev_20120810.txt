[05:41:28] <uGoMobi> errr
[06:09:28] <uGoMobi> sorry for the unnecessary merge commits
[07:34:10] <Wilto> gseguin: _Brilliant_.
[07:49:35] <toddmparker_> hi all
[07:50:27] <toddmparker_> johnbender, gseguin, uGoMobi, Wilto, _|Nix|_ etc. - are we still planning on meeting in a few?
[07:50:53] <gseguin> yup
[07:51:23] <toddmparker_> cool
[07:51:26] <Wilto> I am if you guys are.
[07:51:34] <toddmparker_> i am
[07:51:39] <Wilto> Heads-up: I will be talking about my dog the entire time.
[07:51:53] <toddmparker_> tho can we move it to 11:15? on a call that might go a tad over
[07:52:00] <gseguin> sure
[07:52:02] <toddmparker_> Wilto: bring pics
[07:52:13] <Wilto> http://wil.to/zero-ears.png
[07:52:15] <Wilto> ?Boom
[08:01:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: estoy aqui
[08:03:07] <johnbender> gseguin: toddmparker_: are we doing a hangout?
[08:03:22] <uGoMobi> Wilto: can you check something on Chrome/Mac ?
[08:03:37] <toddmparker_> yes
[08:03:43] <toddmparker_> hangout
[08:03:46] <toddmparker_> at 11:15
[08:03:51] <Wilto> Sure can.
[08:03:56] <Wilto> Hit me, uGoMobi.
[08:04:01] <toddmparker_> gseguin: mind setting one up
[08:04:09] <toddmparker_> i'm going to get right to the end
[08:04:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: aww man I could have slept for 15 more minutes
[08:04:13] <uGoMobi> Wilto http://ugomobi.github.com/test/
[08:04:28] <uGoMobi> Wilto: do you see the bottom border on last fieldcontain?
[08:04:50] <Wilto> No sir.
[08:05:02] <uGoMobi> there is a bug in Chrome
[08:05:10] <uGoMobi> with overflow hidden
[08:06:00] <uGoMobi> the border is there but you dont see it because ui-content has overflow hidden
[08:06:29] <gseguin> I'll set one up at 11:15
[08:07:45] <Wilto> Huh, interesting…
[08:08:33] <uGoMobi> Wilto: or maybe it is not really overflow hidden but more wrong height calculations of the elements inside an element with overflow hidden
[08:09:06] <uGoMobi> code inspector > metrics : you see the pixel values aren't round off
[08:09:50] <Wilto> Hm. Is this a new issue?
[08:10:09] <uGoMobi> Wilto: exactly the same code in a JSBin and you see the border... http://jsbin.com/atahip/29
[08:10:09] <Wilto> I think there has been some new rounding tweakiness lately.
[08:10:18] <Wilto> …huh.
[08:10:59] <Wilto> Hey, wholly unrelated: I’m working on a “swipe to reveal” listview thing that I might PR on over to jQM.
[08:11:24] <gseguin> Wilto: kewl! WANT!
[08:11:28] <uGoMobi> sounds cool
[08:11:37] <Wilto> It’s getting there.
[08:12:16] <Wilto> Scott put together this whole swipe/drag extrapolation helper… thing. It’s badass; I think it would be hugely helpful if we could drop it into jQM and make it public.
[08:13:15] <gseguin> Hangout is published
[08:13:24] <toddmparker_> sorry johnbender
[08:13:45] <toddmparker_> Wilto: do you have the demo link handy
[08:14:03] <toddmparker_> did you see that the swipe kills scrolling? no biggie :)
[08:14:15] <Wilto> It is pretty broken, but http://wil.to/swipe-to-reveal/
[08:14:36] <Wilto> toddmparker_: Yeah, talked that over with Jeff—that was on me, trying to rule out sources of tweakiness. Quick fix.
[08:14:37] <toddmparker_> think this item is listed in the roadmap
[08:14:38] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Bring it on! Though, might I suggest something slightly more general? A carousel ... that's a generalization of swipe-to-reveal, right?
[08:15:05] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: we have a carousel too in the works
[08:15:21] <toddmparker_> both use that swipe behavior
[08:15:42] <toddmparker_> that's why pulling that out as a utility for both is the wayt o go
[08:17:12] <toddmparker_> ok, meeting time
[08:17:13] <Wilto> Fo sho.
[08:17:21] <toddmparker_> gseguin: did you set up a hangout? i can if not
[08:17:23] <Wilto> This uses the same touch handler as the carousel, unmodified.
[08:17:28] <gseguin> I did
[08:17:36] <gseguin> check your g+ stream
[08:18:03] <toddmparker_> ah
[08:18:59] <JasonDScott> I think IT is blocking g+ hangouts
[08:19:27] * johnbender is falling asleep at his desk
[08:19:44] <toddmparker_> bah. downloading plugin
[08:19:47] <toddmparker_> 2 minutes
[08:19:51] <Wilto> johnbender: http://wil.to/_/coffee.gif
[08:19:53] <toddmparker_> for 14mb
[08:20:02] <toddmparker_> does not bode well for video chatting
[08:20:16] <toddmparker_> WAKE UP JOHNBENDER
[08:20:25] <toddmparker_> that's why you get for living on the left coast
[08:20:30] <toddmparker_> halfway there
[08:21:19] <johnbender> Wilto: coffee will "asplode" my heart
[08:21:38] <Wilto> Just two shots of espresso, then. That’s practically decaf.
[08:22:28] <Wilto> Four is “morning coffee.” Six is “I got stuff to do.”
[08:22:58] <Wilto> Wait, no hangout link yet?
[08:23:14] <johnbender> Wilto: have a can of coke zero sends me in to the atmoshpere bruh
[08:23:28] <Wilto> …I envy you.
[08:23:47] <Wilto> You should smash a 5-Hour Energy, just to see what happens.
[08:23:50] <toddmparker_> verifying installation
[08:23:53] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Hangout's in your G+ stream  ...
[08:23:54] <toddmparker_> that is so easy
[08:23:58] <johnbender> s/have/half/
[08:24:02] <Wilto> I got nothin’, _|Nix|_.
[08:24:14] <Wilto> Oh, there it is.
[08:24:18] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: D'you have gseguin In your circles?
[08:24:19] <Wilto> how do i computer
[08:24:35] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: encircle gseguin ...
[08:24:51] <gseguin> "encircle", that sounds...
[08:25:23] <toddmparker_> ok, almost in
[08:27:34] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: are you going to hangout?
[08:27:47] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott: so you're blocked?
[08:27:53] <toddmparker_> enterprise IT
[08:28:09] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_: Yes
[08:28:24] <JasonDScott> another reason i should be working from home...
[08:30:36] <Wilto> so enterprise™
[09:32:33] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I got bounced
[09:32:40] * johnbender grumbles about cable internet providers
[10:24:41] <agcolom> Hi all, not sure I can compete with Todd's pictures, but here's where I am right now...morning view: http://cl.ly/image/0Q0t0d240A1i early evening view: http://cl.ly/image/0d2Q0D451w0G
[10:34:47] <Wilto> Hey, if anyone’s curious about that “swipe to reveal” thing I mentioned: http://wil.to/swipe-to-reveal/
[10:35:06] <Wilto> Still prototype-y; grain of salt.
[12:24:55] <agcolom> quick question: are we going to move to jQuery 1.8?
[12:37:47] <Wilto> Alright guys, check out http://wil.to/swipe-to-reveal/ on an iThing.
[12:38:07] <Wilto> agcolom: Not formally, I don’t think, for a little while yet.
[12:38:29] <agcolom> hi Wilto, I wa just doing that right now! ery nice!
[12:38:47] <agcolom> was and very^
[12:39:15] <Wilto> Thanks. Still a little messy, but the interaction feels pretty solid.
[12:39:34] <agcolom> the animation is very nice!
[12:39:43] <agcolom> (i.e. looks proper!)
[12:40:32] <agcolom> could you set something on the list view based on what was selected underneath?
[12:40:52] <agcolom> (I think that'd be a really useful widget to add)
[12:42:40] <agcolom> Wilto: do you plan on releasing it as a new jqm widget? (if so what would it be called?)
[12:42:53] <Wilto> I have no idea.
[12:43:27] <Wilto> I’m more into getting the touch helper into the library proper; the “swipe” event we’re exposing is really clunky.
[12:44:22] <agcolom> and how is your dog doing?
[12:44:29] <Wilto> http://wil.to/zero-ears.png
[12:45:00] <Wilto> Less bitey and a little more ratty-lookin’ every day.
[12:45:22] <agcolom> oh! He is seriously cute@! how long does he have to wear this for?
[12:45:39] <Wilto> Only a couple more days. He is not a fan of it.
[12:47:00] <agcolom> no animal is! My parents' cat needed it and they had to make it shorter so he wouldn't bump into everything so much!
[12:49:23] <Wilto> Oh yeah, he’s crashing into stuff constantly.
[12:50:38] <agcolom> Wilto: how many vacation days do you get per year in the USA?
[12:50:46] <Wilto> …I have no idea.
[12:50:54] <Wilto> I mean, it varies. Todd prolly knows.
[12:51:45] <agcolom> ok... no big deal, was just wondering...
[12:53:08] <agcolom> are you coming to the jquery UK conference in Oxford (19th April)
[12:54:49] <Wilto> Dunno about that either, but I sure as hell wouldn’t mind going.
[12:55:37] <agcolom> yes, that'd be nice!
[12:56:16] <agcolom> was uGoMobi around today?
[12:57:03] <Wilto> He was around during the call earlier; maybe four or five hours ago.
[12:58:17] <agcolom> ok, thx. I need to catch him for an iframe bug with long custom selects which unfortunately I cannot reproduce outside of the new api docs!
[13:01:41] <agcolom> Wilto: some French sunshine from where I am right now...morning view: http://cl.ly/image/0Q0t0d240A1i early evening view: http://cl.ly/image/0d2Q0D451w0G
[13:03:41] <Wilto> Whew, beats the hell outta Boston.
[13:08:38] <agcolom> my parents are very lucky! (And I enjoy it about twice a year... We're cat-sitting!
[13:15:07] <agcolom> I had a look at the street where your offices are in streetview, and it looks nice!
[13:45:17] <agcolom> hey toddparker!
[13:51:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Very nice place!
[13:51:38] <_|Nix|_> Whaddya guys think about this: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/clrpicker-demo/docs/forms/colorpickers/index.html ? Yes, I like doing things with colours :)
[13:52:26] <_|Nix|_> Is it even worth doing a widget to deal with <input type='color'>? Or, shall we leave it up to each browser's native implem?
[14:04:34] <agcolom> Hi _|Nix|_ :-) Thx :-)
[14:07:17] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: what is strange is in FF14, when I click on the slider, (at the min position), the slider handle jumps to the max position.
[14:12:37] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: that only happens the 1st time I touch that slider. After that, it's all normal.
[14:19:04] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne, you were looking for me?
[22:17:26] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi, yes I was... I have a stupid bug which I cannot reproduce! very annoying!
[23:33:56] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, the demo is very preliminary - with tons of bugs. I just wanted to know what you guys thought about the concept of a colour picker widget in general ...
[23:40:44] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes, I like the idea of a color picker. I was thinking a good example for popups could be a font color changer and a font size changer... but I'm not sure that would work on all browsers...??
[23:44:23] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Good idea ... colour is more consistent, so it's probably easier, and there's an input type specified for it.
[23:44:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: But font could be next.
[23:44:44] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Though I'm not sure there's a way to enumerate fonts.
[23:47:45] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes, for the fonts we could have just 2 or 3 choices (and specify a font size in pixels?)
[23:47:59] <agcolom> (as an example of accessibility
