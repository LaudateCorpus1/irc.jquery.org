[09:05:36] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: for an archive manifest, md5 is plenty enough, isn't it? And the requirement from Google was MD5 anyway...
[10:32:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Fair enough ...
[15:19:40] <vick08> @uGoMobi_ a quick question on CSS transitions and the off-screen content. I see that popups, data-role="popup" are pushing the hidden content off-screen, i.e. not using visibility=hidden or display=none. Is this true for all JQM animations or just this particular one?
[15:21:30] <_|Nix|_> vick08: Actually, that has changed. Popups now use visibility: hidden in addition to pushing things offscreen.
[15:22:24] <_|Nix|_> vick08: IINM pages are hidden entirely when not active.
[15:24:14] <vick08> By now you mean post-1.3.1?
[15:43:22] <vick08> @uGoMobi_ good to know that hidden content is now visibility=hidden, else we would have to give it an aria-hidden=true treatment. Hope applies to all animations/transitions.
[16:19:35] <ryanneufeld> hey guyes
[16:19:42] <ryanneufeld> is it known that this is totally borked? http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/examples/listviews/grid-listview-demo.html
[16:46:47] <gseguin> thanks for the heads up ryanneufeld
[16:46:58] <gseguin> looks like I missed that in the build
[16:47:02] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I tried to fix some of the paths
[16:47:08] <gseguin> will look at it this week
[16:47:11] <ryanneufeld> I actually needed the doc :P
[20:25:18] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: if you check out the source it should work in dev mode where it's using PHP
[22:28:05] <uGoMobi_> ryanneufeld: yes, there are a lot of issues with the demos in the build
[22:29:07] <uGoMobi_> ryanneufeld: here it is ok http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/demos/examples/listviews/grid-listview-demo.html 
[22:30:12] <uGoMobi_> ryanneufeld: it's only in the build, not when you look at the tag on view
[22:30:16] <uGoMobi_> thanks
[22:34:04] <uGoMobi> vick08: both panel and popup now use visibility hidden
[22:36:15] <uGoMobi> vick08: I am checking all widgets where we hide native elements to see if we hide it the correct way
[22:50:50] <vick08> @uGoMobi Thanks a lot. THis is post 1.3.1, correct?
[22:51:09] <uGoMobi> vick08: yes, it will be for 1.4
[22:54:02] <uGoMobi> vick08: actually, the changes to popup might be considered as a bug fix and land in 1.3.2
[22:55:54] <uGoMobi> vick08: I just checked... we didn't cherry-pick it yet for 1.3.2
[22:56:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was visibility hidden for popup a bug fix?
[22:57:49] <uGoMobi> vick08: I am looking at your mail about the collapsible heading
[23:19:33] <vick08> Thanks. Was just about to write to you about that. I ended up resetting background-color to none on the .ui-btn-active and setting the new one instead. That seems to have gotten rid of the blue background.
[23:20:03] <vick08> But I am curious what you think of the idea of an abstracted plugin for ARIA mark-up.
[23:22:56] <vick08> @uGoMobi Thanks. Was just about to write to you about that. I ended up resetting background-color to none on the .ui-btn-active and setting the new one instead. That seems to have gotten rid of the blue background.
[23:22:59] <uGoMobi> vick08: Re: collapsible. I thought we didn't add the .ui-btn-active class there, but maybe I missed something.
[23:23:46] <uGoMobi> vick08: I think for ARIA markup it is best for performance when the widgets handle it as much as possible
[23:24:16] <uGoMobi> vick08: but maybe we need to keep jquery.mobile.links.js to add ARIA markup to anchors
[23:24:46] <vick08> @uGoMobi yes, seems like the style is applied together with .ui-collapsible-heading-toggle .ui-btn .ui-btn-up-c .ui-btn-active
[23:24:46] <b-ot> vick08: Sorry, I can't find anything on .ui-btn-active
[23:25:11] <vick08> uGoMobi On another threadâ€¦ But I am curious what you think of the idea of an abstracted plugin for ARIA mark-up.
[23:27:50] <vick08> uGoMobi apologies for double questions. I didn't see your responses right away.
[23:28:00] <uGoMobi> vick08: no problem
[23:28:59] <vick08> uGoMobi I don't know enough about your new strategy to suggest how to apply aria at this point. Regarding tabviews I will be following up on the issue you sent me earlier. I think I have a clearer picture as to what to do.
[23:29:01] <uGoMobi> vick08: if it would be one abstracted plugin it would have to include logic for all widgets while people might only use a few widgets
[23:31:00] <vick08> uGoMobi if you guys still plan to maintain the same format, that is. <div data-role="collapsible-set"> <div data-role="collapsible"> <h3>heading</h3> <p>content</p> </div> [repeat for more collapsibles] </div>
[23:32:02] <vick08> uGoMobi Good point re one plugin file.
[23:33:08] <vick08> uGoMobi the specific sections of the plugin could be enabled via configuration on any o the page events and/or mobileinit.
[23:34:45] <uGoMobi> vick08: that's true
[23:35:32] <vick08> uGoMobi but yeah, I see the reason for shipping aria mark-up with specific widgets.
[23:37:10] <uGoMobi> vick08: I will ask other team members what they think
[23:39:37] <uGoMobi> vick08: re the collapsible, yes that is markup format that we will keep using. I just don't see that ui-btn-active class. What version of jQuery Mobile do you use?
[23:52:13] <vick08> uGoMobi I use 1.3.1 but instead of accordion I use Frequent's horizontal tabview. My understanding was that the differences are very minimal.
[23:54:06] <uGoMobi> vick08: ok, now I understand. I haven't looked his plugin for a while, but yes in that case the active button class is added to indicate which tab is in view
[23:55:20] <uGoMobi> vick08: we won't use the collapsible set for the new tabview widget, but will base it on the tabview widget from jQuery UI in combination with our navbar
