[02:28:16] <_|Nix|_> riju: If you would like to contribute, in addition to the things I've mentioned, you should also hang around the channel during the afternoon and ask the other guys as well, because they might also have some good ideas about some things you could look at.

[02:46:33] <riju> <_|Nix|_> : ok.
[03:27:58] <agcolom> arschmitz: uGoMobi yes, that jsbin bug with FF, what you need to so is to edit the source and view results in 2 different tabs. 
[03:28:15] <agcolom> to do ^ (not to so!)
[03:29:26] <agcolom> so you do you have a tab with your editing and you choose output. There, click on the small diagonal arrow in the top right hand-side corner. It will open the output in a new tab or new window and that will work fine.

[05:03:14] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_:
[05:04:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! Neck-deep in the popup arrow placement code ...
[05:04:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looks good, but I dunno how we're gonna handle the background for a left/right arrow.
[05:04:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's a gradient, right, so the height of the background div and the offset has to be the same as the height of the popup itself.
[05:05:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So that when you clip a chunk out of it, the individual horizontal lines of colour coincide.
[05:05:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm tricky
[05:06:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... I can size the background div to be the same as the popup and then reflect in the y axis, but for some reason when I do that, the coordinates become all messed up. Like, the screen location of the origin of the coordinate system starts to depend on the width/height of the popup O_o
[05:06:44] <arschmitz> strange
[05:06:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, maybe it's because I was using a translation in my css transform matrix.
[05:07:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have since modified it to only use a rotation and a reflection. Maybe that helps.
[05:07:43] <arschmitz> worth trying
[05:08:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I'll ship the demo with the div containing the background sized to be the same as the div containing the arrow, because the gradients are gentle enough not to be noticed.
[05:09:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can then work on it afterwards. The positioning is complicated enough ...
[05:09:27] <arschmitz> makes sense im sure it looks fine and its just a demo
[05:09:33] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[05:10:24] <arschmitz> when you actually make it part of popup it is something to look at closer probably
[05:10:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm making it an extension. Popup is already enormous as it is.
[05:11:11] <arschmitz> yeah i know i really meant part of library not popup sorry
[05:11:17] <_|Nix|_> Right, yeah ...
[05:11:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I hope to have this transform figured out by then.
[05:11:58] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:12:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, also, the background div needs to be position absolutely, so the rest of the arrow "slides over" it.
[05:12:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, the final position of the arrow also affects the position of the background.
[05:12:42] <arschmitz> i see
[05:13:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: basically, the background needs to be position fixed while being rotated 45Â° due to the arrow, and then rotated -45Â° and reflected to compensate :)
[05:14:04] <arschmitz> ha
[05:14:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think that's a battle for another time :)
[05:14:27] <arschmitz> yeah sounds like it might me
[05:14:29] <arschmitz> be
[06:10:12] <arschmitz> wow theme roller is being super buggy
[06:45:58] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15tommck opened issue #5585: NuGet package for jqm 1.2 should prevent jQuery 1.9 from being installed  02http://git.io/roxKVg
[06:48:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so yesterday i managed to port ui tabs to mobile with out ui core and without modifiying tabs in anyway
[07:04:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Extremely cool!
[07:04:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:http://jsbin.com/uzaret/685/edit

[07:04:59] <arschmitz> even works with ajax tab content
[07:05:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I see it ... 
[07:05:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Very cool!
[07:06:25] <arschmitz> yeah 
[07:06:45] <arschmitz> i didnt think it would be quite that easy
[07:12:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, like, step 0 towards integration is [âœ“]
[07:19:39] <arschmitz> lol
[07:31:35] <toddmparker> hey guys
[07:31:45] <toddmparker> how goes?
[07:34:29] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker: good
[07:34:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Making progress on the arrowed popup. I'll have to make some changes to the popup widget (I've already pushed some, but I'll revert them), but they're not bug fixes or new features. I'm just moving some of the placement code out info functions so I can use them from the extension.
[07:34:45] <_|Nix|_> s/info/into/
[07:35:00] <_|Nix|_> I'm doing that to avoid duplicating the code.
[07:35:19] <_|Nix|_> Should be ready Real Soon Nowâ„¢
[07:42:32] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15glurak15 opened issue #5586: Prevent closing popup on url change  02http://git.io/NWIOOQ
[08:33:28] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: Cool
[08:33:39] <toddmparker> if you can move those changes into a branch, that would be ideal
[08:33:53] <toddmparker> maybe make a 1.3-dev branch
[08:34:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK.
[08:36:17] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: is the idea to re-use the positioning logic for other widgets to take advantage of?
[08:57:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker: you still about?
[10:05:37] <toddmparker> hey arschmitz 
[10:05:43] <toddmparker> heading into a meeting in a few, but i'm here
[10:06:09] <arschmitz> just wanted to let you know i talked to scott_gonzalez and got things rolling there this morning
[10:06:16] <toddmparker> great
[10:06:21] <toddmparker> what's the quick rundown
[10:06:32] <arschmitz> we are going to start with the core stuff
[10:06:49] <toddmparker> makes sense
[10:07:05] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/UI-Integration-planning
[10:07:06] <toddmparker> we going to keep copies or share the same file somehow
[10:07:18] <arschmitz> we are going to do it just like we do with widget facotry
[10:07:25] <arschmitz> take theres and just drop it in
[10:07:37] <toddmparker> ok, easy enough
[10:08:22] <arschmitz> yup theres is really pretty small already and they are working on slimming it down a lot more
[10:08:39] <toddmparker> great there's a punchlist
[10:08:51] <arschmitz> yeah place to get started on our core
[10:08:55] <toddmparker> lots to do
[10:09:07] <arschmitz> we have a lot of redundancy and cruft in there to clean up
[10:09:15] <toddmparker> seems like it
[10:09:29] <toddmparker> use add not merge for decendants (do we want to kill nested list views and depreciate this??)
[10:09:39] <arschmitz> lol
[10:09:43] <toddmparker> ^^ is nested lists the only place this happens
[10:10:09] <toddmparker> i'd like to kill 'em. don't let me forget to add that to the final blog post
[10:10:18] <arschmitz> i need to double check to be sure but im pretty sure the decendants stuff is all only for nested listviews and tracking their generated pages
[10:10:24] <arschmitz> perfect
[10:10:26] <toddmparker> ugh
[10:10:32] <arschmitz> then we can tear them out of 1.4 !
[10:11:38] <arschmitz> i think this is a good start on the merge and scott is working on the zIndex removal as we speak
[10:12:27] <arschmitz> im going to make a branch for this to start with 
[10:12:35] <arschmitz> the core merger that is
[10:34:55] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15CarpeTempus opened issue #5587: Checkbox state  02http://git.io/unNFJw
[10:45:03] <johnbender> toddmparker: arschmitz: I'm "rehydrating" my base tag branch
[10:45:13] <toddmparker> just add water?
[10:45:18] <arschmitz> johnbender: cool 
[10:46:30] <toddmparker> arschmitz: great to hear you and scott_gonzalez are cranking away. the great purge & merge is underway!
[10:48:44] <arschmitz> yup i think im going to also write something up on porting 3rd party ui-widgets to mobile
[10:49:06] <arschmitz> because based on what i did with tabs yesterday for many widgets it is very easy 
[10:49:23] <arschmitz> so be good to show people how to do it
[11:09:01] <toddmparker> that would be great
[11:10:16] <toddmparker> arschmitz: be good to do a code review with scott_gonzalez on a "typical" widget like the slider or collapsible to see how far off we are
[11:10:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I split the positioning logic not so much for other widgets to use, but to make it available to extensions of popup.
[11:10:59] <toddmparker> ah, gotcha
[11:11:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's why I thought it was OK to do this in master. I'm not exposing any new API.
[11:11:37] <toddmparker> wonder if it would ever make sense to make it pluggable so people could use the ui position plugin with popup or our simpler utility
[11:11:50] <toddmparker> so you can choose based on weight and features
[11:11:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's not really a utility.
[11:12:18] <kryl> hi , what's the best to use an image instead of a submit input with jqm please ?
[11:12:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I agree that eventually we might want to look at position, but for now I think what we have is enough.
[11:12:45] <toddmparker> kryl: please use the #jquery channel for questions
[11:12:50] <kryl> ;)
[11:12:58] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yeah, just thinking down the road
[11:13:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK. So, knowing that this is internal to popup, do you still want me to put it on a branch?
[11:13:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm fine with that, but then we need to decide when to merge it.
[11:13:46] <toddmparker> re: changes, the code we shipped for RC should be exactly what final is so that's why we don't want to make any changes to master between now and final
[11:14:01] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK. Got it.
[11:14:14] <toddmparker> johnbender hammered this into my head
[11:14:24] <_|Nix|_> /o
[11:14:39] <_|Nix|_> I'll go revert now.
[11:14:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: toddmparker yay!
[11:14:45] <toddmparker> unless there is a scary blocker from RC, we RC = final so we're in a freeze
[11:14:53] <toddmparker> johnbender: :)
[11:15:03] <johnbender> yah unless we need to fix something before releasing it
[11:15:05] <johnbender> save it for a patch
[11:15:12] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:15:13] <johnbender> we can also do more frequent patch releases
[11:15:15] <toddmparker> right
[11:20:32] <_|Nix|_> OK. Reverted ...

[12:34:18] <agcolom> toddmparker: hi! currently, mobileinit is not documented in the api doc, as it is not in the events page. I think we should document it... Can I use what there is about it on this page: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html ? 
[12:35:42] <agcolom> also, I think the configurable options should appear somewhere... would that go under guides & references ?
[12:35:42] <arschmitz> no we dont its whoever created and registered the package with nuget
[12:36:26] <agcolom> arschmitz: ^ ? That is not a response to my question is it?
[12:36:41] <arschmitz> no sorry its to uGoMobi:
[12:36:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks
[12:36:56] <arschmitz> the global config should probably be its own section
[12:37:00] <uGoMobi> thought so, but wanted to double check
[12:37:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: ^^
[12:37:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://nuget.org/packages?q=jquery+mobile
[12:37:26] <agcolom> yes, still thinking about where to have it... arschmitz ^
[12:37:28] <arschmitz> it looks like damianedwards and outercurve
[12:38:43] <arschmitz> agcolom: i think in refrence same place as data attributes
[12:39:13] <agcolom> yes, I think it's the best place too...
[12:39:33] <agcolom> I am thinking of also having a list of icons as ref as well 
[12:40:03] <arschmitz> i think thats a good idea
[12:41:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah think so too
[12:42:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: looks like he / they did all the jquery stuff on nuget
[12:42:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[12:42:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats the problem with package managers that does use git hub as sources lol
[12:43:02] <agcolom> OMG what's up with master?
[12:43:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I believe at some point se looked at including some files from them in the TR to support NuGet
[12:43:18] <uGoMobi> s/se/we/
[12:43:28] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/ I get a bad gateway (502)
[12:43:30] <uGoMobi> aha 502 again
[12:43:44] <uGoMobi> somebody kick the server please :)
[12:43:48] <arschmitz> gnarf: ryanneufeld: are either of you around?
[12:44:00] <ryanneufeld> yo
[12:44:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: last time it was back again within few minutes
[12:44:17] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld 502 again
[12:44:33] <ryanneufeld> sonnofa
[12:44:43] <ryanneufeld> worksforme
[12:44:51] <arschmitz> damn yep back here too 
[12:45:11] <arschmitz> its so random and lasts no more then a few minutes it seems
[12:45:19] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: what timezone are you in?
[12:45:30] <ryanneufeld> what time do you have now?
[12:45:31] <arschmitz> eastern
[12:45:37] <arschmitz> 3:45
[12:45:41] <gnarf> arschmitz: sup
[12:45:47] <arschmitz> agcolom who saw it though is in great britan
[12:45:59] <ryanneufeld> will you be kicking around near 10pm your time?
[12:46:05] <arschmitz> yes
[12:46:06] <uGoMobi> here in Amsterdam too 
[12:46:13] <uGoMobi> 9.45pm
[12:46:23] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: can you remember to ping me again around then?
[12:46:42] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: ill do my best to remember ha ha
[12:46:48] <ryanneufeld> I'll also try and remember
[12:46:52] <agcolom> is back up all fine now...
[12:47:04] <gnarf> the jquerymobile.com is on apache right now i think
[12:47:21] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: oh, it's proxied right?
[12:47:26] <uGoMobi> it said nginx
[12:47:28] <arschmitz> yeah thats what ryanneufeld: said when he looked before
[12:47:38] <arschmitz> but the problem is on jquerymobile.com/test/
[12:47:42] <arschmitz> which is on nginx
[12:48:12] <gnarf> which is a link to http://builder.jquerymobile.com/test
[12:48:16] <gnarf> er proxy
[12:48:18] <arschmitz> right
[12:48:32] <gnarf> that site uses php yes?
[12:48:36] <ryanneufeld> yes
[12:48:38] <arschmitz> yes
[12:48:46] <gnarf> its on jq03, same as swarm
[12:49:01] <gnarf> I wonder if the swarm/etc php-fpm pool is like crashing out 
[12:49:03] <ryanneufeld> 502 is a bad gateway though right?
[12:49:18] <gnarf> was it a long wait for a 502, or an immediate 502?
[12:49:27] <agcolom> it's all back now but I got a 502 a few mins ago
[12:49:35] <agcolom> immediate
[12:49:35] <uGoMobi> last time when I got a 502 for jquerymobile.com/test/ swarm and jquerymobile.com were both still up
[12:50:13] <gnarf> si
[12:50:15] <gnarf> er
[12:50:15] <gnarf> so
[12:50:16] <gnarf> ...
[12:50:21] <gnarf> couple of team based questions
[12:50:30] <gnarf> the /test is basically view on master yes?
[12:50:35] <arschmitz> yes
[12:50:53] <gnarf> is this used by people outside the team?
[12:50:57] <gnarf> or is it a dev tool
[12:51:01] <gnarf> to view master
[12:51:07] <arschmitz> we refer to it a lot in issues
[12:51:07] <uGoMobi> public
[12:51:10] <gnarf> and if so, do we want something like view.jquery.com
[12:52:31] <gnarf> like for instance http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/timepicker/ gives you the mask branch
[12:52:56] <agcolom> gnarf: to answer your earlier question: I had jquerymobile.com/test/ opened for a while. I clicked one of the links there, and I got the usual JQM error (error loading page). So I refreshed the whole page and got 502 straight away
[12:52:59] <arschmitz> gnarf: something like that would be cool but would have to actually display the working site not just a file tree
[12:53:55] <arschmitz> gnarf: we have a structure like that already its just jquerymobile.com/branches/branch-name/
[12:54:01] <gnarf> i guess, my main question is, what will happen to this as we move onto the jquerymobile.com on wordpress - what exactly is this doing, is this the "demo site" ?
[12:54:17] <arschmitz> yes this is the demo site
[12:55:43] <arschmitz> gnarf this is the demos site and then /branches/ is the demos site for each branch
[12:55:46] <arschmitz> what used to be the docs
[12:57:15] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz toddmparker I thought that in supported platforms we had BlackBerry 10 Â­ (Tested on Dev Alpha)? but I can't find it anymore... (or did I just dream it)?
[12:58:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am not sure if we already added it, but we can add it now :)
[12:58:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that was the right call on the nuget package. I guess he thought we were providing it
[12:58:14] <arschmitz> agcolom: i swear you were right just a couple days ago but i dont see it anymore
[12:58:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: and probably say tested on Z10
[12:58:58] <agcolom> that'd be great :-)
[12:59:17] <gnarf> okay - just trying to simplify/standardize if we can... perhaps move to the same sort of structures already in place on the other projects.  the current setup is obviously causing some issues
[12:59:26] <agcolom> especially with the massive buzz at the moment with BB and BBJam
[12:59:29] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah think so... we did look at including something in the ThemeRoller for NuGet didn't we?
[12:59:55] <arschmitz> gnarf: yeah i think that would be fine as long as it displayed the actual demos pages instead of a file tree
[13:00:08] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I was at BBJam today and tested JQM myself :)
[13:00:37] <arschmitz> gnarf: would give us an actual menu for the branches too!
[13:00:40] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Fantastic!
[13:01:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you happen to see the random static on long pages that toddmparker: and i saw?
[13:01:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, not really... but  I can test again tomorrow
[13:01:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: have to say that both slider and rangeslider had poor performance
[13:02:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we both saw it on ... http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/buttons/
[13:02:25] <uGoMobi> but tested on iPhone 4 and Nexus Android 4.1 and that wasn't much better
[13:02:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not suprised
[13:02:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok I will test that page tomorrow
[13:03:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on the ones they sent filament it was really bad
[13:03:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was that a Dev Alpha or the Z10?
[13:03:59] <arschmitz> i dont remember would have to check with toddmparker: he has the phones
[13:04:03] <uGoMobi> because they changed the GPU after Dev Alpha
[13:04:16] <uGoMobi> I went to a talk about the BB 10 browser
[13:04:25] <uGoMobi> by the guy who was responsible for it
[13:04:44] <arschmitz> cool
[13:05:04] <uGoMobi> panels look great on BB 10
[13:05:50] <uGoMobi> not surprising... they use the same CSS
[13:06:21] <uGoMobi> the browser is built with HTML5 and CSS and JS
[13:07:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: agcolom : can you reproduce this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5584
[13:07:52] <uGoMobi> ?
[13:08:04] <uGoMobi> swipe not working on MacOS/FF
[13:08:27] <arschmitz> i dont actually have firefox on my mac ill install it and check
[13:08:55] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/swipe/newyork.html
[13:09:00] <uGoMobi> test page ^^
[13:09:15] <uGoMobi> I know agcolom has FF for sure :)
[13:10:48] <agcolom> uGoMobi: let me check... I have tested and it works, but I'll just double check now...
[13:11:03] <agcolom> especially as I have some examples ;-)
[13:11:42] <uGoMobi> cool thanks
[13:12:47] <agcolom> works fine for me: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/resources/swipe/example1.html
[13:13:03] <agcolom> I can create a jsbin and reply to the guy if you like...
[13:13:31] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ^
[13:14:54] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks for testing
[13:15:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we can just close and link to the page we tested
[13:15:39] <uGoMobi> probably problem with his code
[13:16:38] <agcolom> uGoMobi: will do that now :-)
[13:16:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok great! thanks!
[13:20:50] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I've kept the issue opened with with an unconfirmed label
[13:20:57] <agcolom> but with ^
[13:22:17] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok thanks
[13:23:29] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the JS Bin uses 1.3 beta 1
[13:23:45] <uGoMobi> did you test with latest?
[13:24:12] <agcolom> oh, no... ok, lets try with latest...
[13:25:57] <agcolom> all good with latest http://jsbin.com/uzutem/3 
[13:27:38] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ^
[13:29:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, perfect

[15:58:55] <toddmparker> Hi all
[15:58:59] <toddmparker> In a long meeting so I'll catch up 
[16:05:48] <scottjehl______> johnbender> sorry - busy day. did you have a question for me?
[16:06:22] <scottjehl______> "my basetag branch appears to work with relative images so I'm wondering what Scott saw when I merged it last :("
[16:06:24] <scottjehl______> hmm
[16:06:33] <scottjehl______> it's been a while I vaguely remember the issue
[16:08:54] <toddmparker> Hey scottjehl______ 
[16:08:58] <toddmparker> Nice nick
[16:09:25] <scottjehl______> that's ScottJehl Space to you, Todd
[16:09:36] <scottjehl______> _____________________________________
[16:09:43] <scottjehl______> :)
[16:09:57] <scottjehl______> johnbender: you've given that a lot of attention so if it looks good to you, I'd feel comfortable going with it. I can't recall if I was concerned or had a valid issue with it
[16:10:26] <scottjehl______> gotta run - feel free to message me about it
[16:10:29] <johnbender> scottjehl______: kk
[16:10:34] <johnbender> scottjehl______: thanks for responding
[16:10:41] <johnbender> I'll get some help trying it out and we'll see
[16:11:48] <johnbender> toddmparker: not sure how to test that other than responding on the issue about the branch
[16:12:08] <johnbender> that is I'm not sure how suss out all the issues other than doing some simple testing
[16:12:16] <johnbender> it appears to work when it's enabled and when it's not
[16:31:46] <toddmparker> Sorry johnbender, lost my web
[16:32:06] <toddmparker> arschmitz: I thought bb10 was on the list too
[17:12:35] <johnbender> toddmparker: no worries
[17:12:44] <johnbender> just need to test the base tag stuff a bit and I'm not quite sure how
[17:12:56] <johnbender> the docs work

[18:58:17] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: you around?
[18:58:23] <ryanneufeld> I am
[18:58:33] <arschmitz> i actually remembered lol
[18:58:53] <ryanneufeld> oh, yeah
[18:58:55] <ryanneufeld> right lol
[18:59:12] <ryanneufeld> did gnarf get that stuff figured out?
[18:59:29] <arschmitz> not sure he tried i think he wants to move it
[18:59:47] <ryanneufeld> okay,
[18:59:52] <arschmitz> to be consistant with core and ui with a view.jquerymobile.com
[18:59:56] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[19:00:02] <ryanneufeld> I think he's right
[19:00:07] <ryanneufeld> in the mean time
[19:00:09] <arschmitz> yeah i think so too
[19:00:12] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna check the logs
[19:00:18] <arschmitz> ok
[19:00:20] <ryanneufeld> see what they say about why it's failing
[19:00:33] <ryanneufeld> I'll let you know, what if anything, I find
[19:00:34] <arschmitz> yeah its random as far as iv seen so far
[19:00:38] <arschmitz> ok
[20:26:53] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: well, it seems the problem is apache is having issues managing the proxy to the builder server
[20:27:22] <ryanneufeld> I think like gnarf suggested moving to view.jquerymobile.com is going to be a better long-term option
