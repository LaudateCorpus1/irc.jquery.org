[02:31:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 4 new commits to zoom: http://git.io/H6TcNA
[02:31:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/zoom] added the locked property, with options to lock and unlock it when calling disable or enable, respectively. This allows a plugin to take control and ensure zoom isn't messed with while it's carrying out a zoom-specific task - scottjehl
[02:31:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/zoom] namespaced the events. - scottjehl
[02:31:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/zoom] modified so that the select zoom calls manipulate the locked property, to ensure other zoom plugins don't mess with it during focus - scottjehl
[02:37:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 21 new commits to master: http://git.io/kiSjWA
[02:37:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] A new utility: $.mobile.zoom, which as 3 members: enabled [bool], disable [function], and enable [function]. - scottjehl
[02:37:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] fixed a duplicate listing - scottjehl
[02:37:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] added meta viewport tag - scottjehl
[08:13:58] <toddparker> morning all
[08:15:15] <toddparker> this guys just added a filter to the custom selects
[08:15:19] <toddparker> demo looks great
[08:15:19] <toddparker> http://www.dotnetwise.com/tryAndError/jquery.mobile/select.filter/#&ui-page=0-0
[08:15:29] <toddparker> there is a PR for it
[08:15:42] <toddparker> might be nice for 1.1.
[08:17:25] <toddparker> …or 1.2 or whatever
[08:23:21] <Dragooon> 1.5
[08:24:00] <toddparker> heh
[08:24:24] <toddparker> figure if you're going to take the perf hit for custom selects, it might as well give you more functionality
[08:26:54] <Dragooon> I use selects as menus mostly, might come in handy though
[08:45:11] <toddparker> Dragooon: you'll appreciate the new popup plugin then
[08:45:22] <toddparker> do you tend to use native or custom menus?
[08:53:11] <Dragooon> toddparker: Native for now, seems to work better
[08:53:48] <toddparker> it's way faster anyway
[08:54:11] <toddparker> did you see we just landed a fix for iOS' orientation change bug
[08:54:30] <toddparker> and applied a similar technique to prevent eh annoying select zoom in when focused thing?
[08:54:31] <Wilto> Man, I love the sound of that. “A fix for iOS’ orientation change bug.”
[08:54:36] <toddparker> another of my pet peeves
[08:55:31] <Dragooon> Not really, haven't feel following got commits lately
[08:55:34] <Dragooon> ben*
[08:55:36] <Dragooon> been*
[09:31:34] <Wilto> ALL HANDS, REPORT IN.
[09:31:52] <gseguin> 'sup?
[09:32:08] <Wilto> We’re doing a testing blitz on 1.0-stable.
[09:32:24] <Wilto> Crack it open on various devices, click around, and make sure there’s nothing glaring.
[09:32:41] <imjoshdean> Wilto: Link?
[09:32:41] <Wilto> I assume there is not since only minor stuff went into 1.0-stable anyway, but better safe than sorry.
[09:32:44] <Wilto> http://wil.to/4g
[09:32:51] <Wilto> Wil.to’d, for your convenience.
[09:33:01] <imjoshdean> Wil.to'd for her pleasure
[09:33:09] <toddparker> i need a shower
[09:33:28] <toddparker> i.e. "ewwwwwww"
[09:33:35] <gseguin> :)
[09:34:02] <gseguin> toddparker: I downgrade the version you were releasing in the post
[09:34:09] <gseguin> from 10.0.1 to 1.0.1
[09:34:26] <gseguin> s/downgrade/downgraded/
[09:34:27] <Wilto> Dude, 10.0.1 means it’s 9 better. I say we keep it.
[09:34:38] <toddparker> heh, thanks gseguin
[09:34:41] <toddparker> are you out?
[09:34:47] <toddparker> i have more edits..
[09:34:55] <gseguin> yep
[09:36:12] <imjoshdean> Wilto: iOS 5.0.1 lookin' good
[09:36:23] <Wilto> Clicking around on Android 2.3 now.
[09:36:46] <Wilto> No specific trouble areas in mind—just mash on various and sundry widgets.
[09:36:53] <imjoshdean> 2.3.3 here
[09:37:12] <Wilto> Oh, sweet.
[09:37:20] <Wilto> I’ll grab one of our weirder gadgets, then.
[09:38:52] <imjoshdean> are the custom select menus supposed to be so glaringly different between ios and android?
[09:39:00] <Wilto> Yessir.
[09:39:06] <imjoshdean> bummer, android looks better.
[09:39:17] <Wilto> They use the native selects.
[09:39:20] <imjoshdean> I don't often say that
[09:40:59] <imjoshdean> Wilto: android 2.3.3 looks good.
[09:41:22] <Wilto> Sweet.
[09:41:53] <Wilto> BlackBerry 7 does not look good. So, everything’s normal there.
[09:42:33] <johnbender> I'm kind of hopeful for a bb10 bold
[09:42:37] <johnbender> it might be my next device
[09:43:33] <johnbender> though I could do without the shrinking icons and applications
[09:43:39] <johnbender> those transitions are jarring
[09:44:07] <Wilto> Wait, like, to use on purpose?
[09:44:27] <johnbender> yes
[09:44:31] <johnbender> I like the form factor
[09:44:44] <johnbender> Wilto: 2 things you don't know about me that contribute to that
[09:44:49] <johnbender> I have sausage fingers
[09:44:57] <johnbender> (onscreen keyboard == death)
[09:45:11] <johnbender> and I don't do much other than email and reading my feeds on my phone
[09:45:15] <johnbender> maps occasionally
[09:45:37] <Wilto> Damn, man.
[09:45:49] <Wilto> A real live BlackBerry user, right in our midst.
[09:45:56] <imjoshdean> Wilto: You know what to do.
[09:46:00] <imjoshdean> Get the pitchforks.
[09:46:01] <johnbender> I would also be happy if Nokia kept going with Meego and the new n9
[09:46:12] <johnbender> Wilto: I currently use android
[09:46:19] <toddparker> yeah, meego is cool
[09:46:26] <Wilto> I’ll second that. I dig Meego.
[09:46:28] <johnbender> but I refuse to buy another one of those damn phones until they fix the browser
[09:46:29] <toddparker> sort of like iOS but a but minimal
[09:46:35] <imjoshdean> I've not seen meego in action
[09:46:36] <Wilto> I actually dig Mango, browser aside.
[09:46:38] <toddparker> bender - did you're PB work for you?
[09:46:41] <johnbender> the n9 is a hot piece of hardware
[09:46:44] <toddparker> yeah
[09:46:46] <johnbender> toddparker: it did indeed
[09:46:50] <Wilto> Truth.
[09:46:52] <johnbender> thus my commentary on the user experience
[09:46:58] <toddparker> we just got a lumia 800 from nokia
[09:47:04] <johnbender> toddparker: screw you guys
[09:47:04] <toddparker> same hardware but wp7
[09:47:06] <toddparker> it's nice
[09:47:10] <toddparker> heh
[09:47:11] <johnbender> :D
[09:47:40] <toddparker> so can you test both master (transitions, fixed, esp.) on PB2
[09:47:43] <Wilto> If one phone in the lab were to lure me away from my iPhone, I think that’s it.
[09:47:44] <toddparker> mine has the worst wifi
[09:47:52] <johnbender> toddparker: yah I saw your email
[09:47:59] <toddparker> so frustraing
[09:48:11] <toddparker> but each day i'd get one step further along
[09:48:17] <toddparker> sort of stuck on the update tho
[09:48:33] <toddparker> but if you can test 1.0-stable now
[09:48:42] <toddparker> and master soon, that would be super
[09:49:00] <toddparker> wonder if kinblas of gseguin got their PB's
[09:50:08] <Wilto> Again, PSA: http://wil.to/4g points to http://jquerymobile.com/branches/1.0-stable/index.html
[09:50:49] <gseguin> toddparker: I didn't get anything :( maybe I'm on the naughty list
[09:51:38] <Wilto> Yeah, weren’t you guys supposed to get Nokia gadgets, too?
[09:52:13] <gseguin> Yeah, never heard back grom these guys
[09:53:04] <johnbender> Wilto: toddparker: since you're both here did you want to do some device testing for 1.0.1 and then release on Thursday?
[09:53:19] <gseguin> Wilto: Android 2.1 looks good
[09:53:21] <Wilto> Doing so as we speak, Brohammad Ali.
[09:53:35] <johnbender> Wilto: did you see my comment on the test index and the amd additions?
[09:53:46] <Wilto> Oh, no.
[09:53:48] <johnbender> from that commit you pulled in from kin
[09:54:18] <toddparker> johnbender: yeah, mat is going to test today. blog post is written
[09:54:25] <toddparker> we can go tomorrow if you want
[09:55:17] <rwaldron> Wilto do you have a link to a public 1.0.1 set up?
[09:55:26] <Wilto> Ah, got it. Good catch, johnbender.
[09:55:40] <Wilto> rwaldron: http://wil.to/4d, which points to http://jquerymobile.com/branches/1.0-stable/index.html
[09:55:46] <johnbender> rwaldron: if the branch preview is working it should just be 1.0-stable
[09:56:06] <Wilto> Wil.to’d for less typing on crappy mobile keyboards.
[09:56:19] <rwaldron> Wilto thanks dude
[09:56:41] <rwaldron> oh, that's the same as the one above.. ok
[09:58:40] <johnbender> Wilto: it might need different css refs too now since we've changed that
[09:58:58] <Wilto> Yeah, think so. Lemme do that real quick.
[10:00:52] <johnbender> Wilto: going to go check on the 1.0-stable build to make sure that's still running
[10:01:01] <Wilto> johnbender: Good call.
[10:03:38] <toddparker> just updated the support browser list for 1.0.1
[10:03:42] <toddparker> lots of new devices
[10:08:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/xQawRg
[10:08:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Updated paths to JS and CSS. - Mat Marquis
[10:09:54] <johnbender> Wilto: ah! that's a functional test
[10:09:56] <johnbender> it's not picked up by the test suite
[10:10:09] <johnbender> we have a clean build on stable and master
[10:10:39] <rwaldron> dudes, I need to step out, but I just tested the latest master and I'm still experiencing fixed toolbars being left with opacity: 0 on the "initial page"
[10:10:44] <rwaldron> on an actual device
[10:10:55] <rwaldron> (iPhone 4S, iOS 5.0.1)
[10:11:09] <Wilto> Back momentarily.
[10:11:09] <johnbender> rwaldron: can we trouble you to log an issue/
[10:11:17] <rwaldron> johnbender i'd love to
[10:12:28] <rwaldron> johnbender Wilto https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3483
[10:12:29] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3483 on jquery-mobile, reported by rwldrn (21.371s ago): Fixed toolbars left with opacity: 0 on initial page.
[10:12:41] <johnbender> rwaldron: thanks much sir
[10:12:44] <rwaldron> I'll be back shortly to help test and stuff
[10:12:46] <rwaldron> no problem
[10:21:50] <johnbender> toddparker: so close to merging in sergey's checkboxradio perf improvements
[10:22:02] <johnbender> it's all the setAttribute stuff I'm worried about though :(
[10:48:58] <toddparker> johnbender: i'm not sure what the impact is of that change is
[10:49:12] <toddparker> maybe we can ask rwaldron for an opinion?
[10:49:57] <johnbender> toddparker: which is that?
[10:50:08] <johnbender> toddparker: I thnk I missed your message I hopped on and off the adobe vpn
[11:02:41] <toddparker> ah
[11:02:52] <toddparker> your concern re:setAttribute
[11:02:59] <toddparker> johnbender ^^
[11:03:30] <toddparker> johnbender, gseguin, Wilto - making yellow banners for the docs home
[11:03:38] <toddparker> just made a 1.0.1
[11:03:43] <toddparker> and some 1.1 RC versions
[11:03:50] <toddparker> we do need to make that CSS
[11:03:52] <toddparker> anyway
[11:03:59] <toddparker> for master, what shout it say?
[11:03:59] <johnbender> toddparker: well in general there are issues with ie7 and setAttribute, from my teency bit of research it appears that it's confined to setting the class
[11:04:02] <toddparker> 1.Next
[11:04:02] <johnbender> err
[11:04:03] <johnbender> style attribute
[11:04:13] <johnbender> toddparker: latest?
[11:04:18] <gseguin> +1 on making it in CSS
[11:04:19] <johnbender> unstable?
[11:04:32] <toddparker> Unstable might be good
[11:04:40] <toddparker> Development
[11:04:42] <toddparker> ?
[11:04:43] <johnbender> toddparker: and we should do the semver thing too
[11:04:47] <toddparker> In Development?
[11:04:51] <johnbender> 1.1.0-unstable
[11:04:53] <johnbender> or some such
[11:04:56] <toddparker> is that the js version?
[11:05:11] <toddparker> sorry, what is semver
[11:06:04] <johnbender> toddparker: semver.org
[11:06:22] <johnbender> that's how we're determining what can go in a patch release, point release, etc
[11:06:43] <johnbender> toddparker: also, according to scott_gonzalez we'll need to be exact with those to use the plugins websiste
[11:06:48] <johnbender> either way it's a good idea
[11:06:57] <johnbender> sane standards == good
[11:07:14] <Wilto> I DISAGREE
[11:07:19] <Wilto> INSANE STANDARDS ONLY FROM NOW ON
[11:07:23] <johnbender> sane standard > bad standard > no standard
[11:07:35] <Wilto> WE’RE A .NET FRAMEWORK NOW
[11:07:47] <scott_gonzalez> sane standard > bad standard > no standard > commonjs? :-P
[11:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> just kidding
[11:07:54] <toddparker> We don't need to follow any conventions
[11:08:22] <Wilto> Like a zen thing, you’re saying, toddparker.
[11:08:31] <toddparker> JQM-JXML-OPACITY-EFFECT=TRUE
[11:08:33] <Wilto> “When one has no convention, one can be all conventions.”
[11:08:36] <johnbender> do or do not, there is no standard
[11:08:37] <gseguin> free spirits
[11:08:39] <toddparker> very zen
[11:08:46] <gseguin> you hippies!
[11:08:46] <toddparker> namaste
[11:09:01] <Wilto> I’m from Cambridge, after all.
[11:09:12] <toddparker> \oo/-

[11:09:24] <DaveMethvin> sane love > bad love > no love > ... profit?
[11:09:27] <toddparker> whatever left-coasters
[11:09:43] <DaveMethvin> i love lurking here, you guys crack me up
[11:09:43] <toddparker> DaveMethvin: are you a pimp now?
[11:09:56] <toddparker> mostly me, right? I'm funny.
[11:10:04] <DaveMethvin> it's hard out here for me, so yeah i must be a pimp
[11:10:07] <Wilto> I’m hit-and-miss, if I’m being honest.
[11:10:24] <toddparker> one quick question guys...
[11:10:35] <toddparker> WHATAREWETALKINGABOUTTHISISMADNESS
[11:10:50] <toddparker> +1 on the saver stuff
[11:11:02] <toddparker> is that something we can do for 1.0.1?
[11:11:07] <toddparker> semver, der
[11:11:42] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: you mean Wilto cracks you up
[11:11:47] <johnbender> the rest of use are dry
[11:12:00] <DaveMethvin> i like it dry ... humor that is
[11:12:05] <Wilto> I think that was a coding burn on me.
[11:12:28] <johnbender> toddparker: yah take a read of the link I sent out during the branch strat discussions
[11:12:31] <johnbender> semver.org
[11:12:47] <johnbender> the only thing we really need to do is to make sure we're including the patch version in all our version strings
[11:12:53] <rwaldron> Hey dudes
[11:12:54] <johnbender> 1.0.0 instead of 1.0
[11:13:02] <rwaldron> sorry, I missed whoever pinged me
[11:13:13] <johnbender> toddparker: then rcs are just 1.1.0-rc1
[11:13:33] <johnbender> though I think the node version support 1.1.0rc1 according to scott_gonzalez
[11:13:37] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: ^
[11:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, 1.1.0rc1 is supported
[11:14:00] <johnbender> toddparker: where the node version is a library that checks your version string and tells you if you're doing it right
[11:14:17] <toddparker> gotcha
[11:14:28] <johnbender> toddparker: so that part is up to you really
[11:14:43] <toddparker> so we need 3 digit numbers, event or 1.0 or 1.1
[11:15:09] <toddparker> someone asked for a similar thing to core that will let you ask what version via JS
[11:15:16] <toddparker> separate matter
[11:15:16] <johnbender> anyone know how to set up a command line build target in eclipse that will run and attach to the process for debugging?
[11:15:21] <johnbender> toddparker: yes
[11:19:10] <toddparker> so DaveMethvin or rwaldron - johnbender was wondering about issues with ie7 and setAttribute
[11:19:20] <toddparker> johnbender: maybe you can explain the details
[11:20:38] <DaveMethvin> ie7 mixes up attributes and properties on a regular basis, timmywil put in a wide-ranging fix that uses getAttributeNode
[11:21:26] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: there's a couple pull requests for perf improvements that use setAttribute to spead things up
[11:21:37] <johnbender> generally speaking that's fine but so far as I understand it there are issues in ie7
[11:21:50] <johnbender> I guess I'm trying to guage the level of badness there
[11:21:55] <johnbender> "badness"
[11:22:07] <johnbender> should we swear off of setattribute even for perf reasons
[11:22:14] <DaveMethvin> so are the speedups breaking in ie7?
[11:22:28] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: no, I just got concerned from some of my research
[11:22:37] <johnbender> and the ways in which it would break are not testable
[11:22:40] <johnbender> ie, visual
[11:23:00] * johnbender longs for a way to do visual verification
[11:23:24] <johnbender> s/visual verification/automated visual verification/
[11:23:27] <DaveMethvin> so what is the slow part? is it because you are using .attr()?
[11:23:34] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: "slow"
[11:23:39] <johnbender> always a relative term
[11:23:55] <johnbender> the changes address windows phone performance issues
[11:24:11] <DaveMethvin> well whaddya expect for ie7
[11:24:13] <DaveMethvin> :D
[11:24:37] <Wilto> I pine for the days when IE was my biggest problem.
[11:24:39] <Wilto> coughandroidcough
[11:25:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah just not sure what the bottleneck is there. Do you have a pull request i can look at?
[11:26:09] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: indeed
[11:26:34] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3289
[11:26:36] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by sgrebnov (1m, 1w ago): Gallery page performance improvements
[11:26:57] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: MS is paying for this guy to work on wp7 issues
[11:27:04] <johnbender> so I'm happy to bend over backwards
[11:27:09] <johnbender> fold myself into tiny pieces
[11:27:15] <johnbender> to get these into the code base
[11:28:45] <toddparker> quick convention Q guys
[11:29:03] <toddparker> should i update the copyright in the footer from 2011 to 2012
[11:29:14] <toddparker> or should it be 2011-2012
[11:29:29] <toddparker> anyone have an opinion?
[11:30:25] <gseguin> toddparker: When was the first check-in?
[11:30:32] <gseguin> 2011 or 2010?
[11:32:21] <johnbender> toddparker: 1975-2313
[11:33:58] <Wilto> Just like my tombstone will read.
[11:35:36] <DaveMethvin> poor toddparker, he had a good 338 years until Wilto stole his tombstone
[11:35:40] <DaveMethvin> i don't recall all the quirks of ie7, but yeah i understand why this might be concerning johnbender ... those may need to be properties?
[11:35:49] <DaveMethvin> at least some of them
[11:36:06] <Wilto> Is this the checkbox/radio thing?
[11:36:26] <DaveMethvin> tabindex too
[11:36:41] <Wilto> Ahh.
[11:36:59] <DaveMethvin> i just wonder how much $("<div>") vs document.createElement("div") saves you
[11:37:04] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: alright I'm headed out to lunch, thanks for taking a look
[11:37:15] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: his numbers made a pretty big diff on load
[11:37:24] <DaveMethvin> well you can't argue with that
[11:37:28] <Wilto> It’s… infinitesimally quicker, I would think.
[11:37:34] <Wilto> Oh, huh. Retracted.
[11:38:08] <DaveMethvin> Wilto: it might be the combination of things, or perhaps one particular thing
[11:38:57] <Wilto> Who knows how JavaScript works. Surely not I.
[12:01:58] <gseguin> did you guys see this: https://twitter.com/#!/bobrullo/statuses/161890858323558400
[12:01:59] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from bobrullo: Is it just me or did jQuery Mobile bastardize data-*?  #jquerymobile #stillevaluating ★ http://bit.ly/y4ZfUv
[12:08:46] <toddparker> that is a tricky one
[12:09:00] <toddparker> everyone is going to have a line where data- should be used
[12:09:07] <toddparker> but it's open ended, just custom attrs
[12:09:32] <toddparker> some of the styling stuff is on the edge, but many style things needs extra markup/classes

[13:29:51] <rwaldron> toddparker i think we close that fixed toolbar ticket
[13:30:27] <rwaldron> i just discovered there was some bullshit css being built into our app
[13:30:44] <rwaldron> that existed for supporting transitions in firefox or some nonsense
[13:30:49] <rwaldron> i just dropped it
[13:31:06] <rwaldron> i'm testing now without my patch to jQuery Mobile master
[14:00:14] <toddparker> you and your bullshit CSS rwaldron
[14:00:24] <toddparker> i've had it
[14:01:07] <rwaldron> sorry dude
[14:01:53] <rwaldron> i'm just glad I found it before scott started working on the issue
[14:01:53] <rwaldron> that wouldve sucked
[14:13:19] <johnbender> rwaldron: I'm sure Scott would have pulled your code into a new jsbin
[14:13:36] <rwaldron> there was no code to pull in
[14:13:38] <rwaldron> :P
[14:14:05] <eddiemonge> what a bad user ticket
[14:14:10] <eddiemonge> no code. pssht!
[14:14:22] <rwaldron> for real.
[14:42:32] <Wilto> Stupid cloud.
[14:44:29] <Wilto> So, some serious testing of 1.0-stable went down today, and we are looking fine by all accounts.
[14:44:38] <johnbender> hell yah
[14:45:39] <Wilto> it does not work on ipads anymore though is that okay guys y/n
[14:48:00] <Wilto> I heard this “Apple” company isn’t doing very well anyway; I figure it’s no big.
[15:10:57] <gseguin> wow! that was IRCCloud choking
[15:33:51] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/hq1Atw

[16:46:30] <gseguin> is it awfully quiet this afternoon or is it IRCCloud acting up?
