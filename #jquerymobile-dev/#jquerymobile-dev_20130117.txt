[02:37:08] <fairuz> Hi guys. Question on jQuery mobile. I have this error : cannot call methods on popup prior to initialization;Â attempted to call method 'close'. I don't quite understand why I have this error?  I do have data-role="popup" for the popup divs.
[02:37:19] <fairuz>  And they are inside divs with data-role="page"
[02:37:44] <fairuz> It's on Android 2.3.3
[02:56:26] <uGoMobi> fairuz: #jquery is the channel for support wit jQuery core, UI and Mobile
[02:56:55] <uGoMobi> fairuz: or post on the forum so you can show your code in a JS Bin for example
[02:56:55] <fairuz> uGoMobi: Thanks. I have doubts so asked in both channels.
[02:57:07] <uGoMobi> fairuz: about the error
[02:57:22] <fairuz> uGoMobi: Ok thanks
[02:57:29] <uGoMobi> fairuz: could it be you have the popup outside the page?
[02:57:53] <uGoMobi> popup markup
[02:58:27] <fairuz> uGoMobi: Already checked that and all of the popup divs are in a page.
[02:58:55] <uGoMobi> fairuz: ah ok
[02:59:35] <uGoMobi> fairuz: with a problem like this it's probably best to show your code so I suggest to post on the forum
[02:59:57] <uGoMobi> fairuz: I will take a look at it if you post there
[03:10:12] <fairuz> uGoMobi: Sure. I will do that in a moment. WIll try to debug it myself first. I'm pretty sure I messed up somewhere :)
[03:11:09] <uGoMobi> fairuz: ok

[05:01:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Good morning
[05:03:38] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:03:52] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_:
[05:16:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Did you happen to look at this PR? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5466
[05:17:04] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[05:17:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no I didn't look at it yet
[05:18:04] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[05:18:06] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_
[05:21:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: did you see that PR?
[05:29:28] * _|Nix|_ looks
[05:29:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im pretty sure that wont work
[05:37:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Commented ...
[05:38:09] <arschmitz> nix also getattribute is not cross browser safe
[05:39:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ and they dont properly set up the namespace either
[05:39:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... getAttribute isn't even present on caniuse.com ...
[05:40:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://veerasundar.com/blog/2010/12/javascript-getattribute-method/
[05:41:12] <arschmitz> also data prevents circular refrences and memory leaks
[05:43:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You might wanna comment too then - sounds like you've also made some fair points.
[05:43:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah ill add a comment
[06:27:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: is github working for you guys?

[06:55:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ping!
[06:55:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hi
[06:55:53] <uGoMobi> hi
[06:56:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I have a question
[06:56:09] <uGoMobi> working on some panel issues
[06:56:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure
[06:56:41] <uGoMobi> I need to set min-height for page when panel is open
[06:56:47] <arschmitz> ok
[06:56:56] <uGoMobi> but restore the original min-height when panel is closed
[06:57:06] <arschmitz> sure
[06:57:13] <uGoMobi> I was thinking to store the original min-height in data- attribute
[06:57:23] <uGoMobi> works fine
[06:57:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no need to expose it
[06:57:44] <arschmitz> use extend and add it to the panel widget object
[06:59:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: in create there should be a call to $.extend() where we add things like that
[06:59:39] <arschmitz> (there isnt one we are using expandos thought i fixed that :()
[07:00:09] <arschmitz> anyway in that non existant extend i would add pageMinHeight 
[07:00:15] <arschmitz> then on open set it
[07:00:22] <arschmitz> and on close use it to restore
[07:00:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if you want i can take care of it should only take a minute
[07:13:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: do you want me to push the change to use extend i found where i did it already just forgot to commit it
[07:15:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry I was disconnected from IRC... reading log now
[07:15:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem 
[07:16:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, sure let's use extend
[07:16:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just thinking about what happens on resize
[07:16:45] <uGoMobi> while the panel is open
[07:17:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cant you just reset it on throttled resize too?
[07:18:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you can just reset min-height and update value on throttled resize
[07:20:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok I think that will work
[07:20:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hold on a sec might be a better way to do this remembering something i did to fix a bug in 1.1 way way back
[07:21:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is a function resetActivePageHeight in mobile.navigation.js
[07:22:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if we expose that you can use that to reset the page height
[07:22:55] <arschmitz> then you dont need to store anything?
[07:23:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that sounds perfect
[07:23:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sweet ill push the change to extend and a change to expose this
[07:23:53] <arschmitz> then you can just use that and on close
[07:23:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great, thanks!
[07:24:02] <uGoMobi> yup
[07:26:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: would even be better if that function accepts a parameter
[07:26:15] <arschmitz> ok what do you want the param to do?
[07:26:32] <uGoMobi> now it always uses getScreenHeight()
[07:26:55] <arschmitz> ok
[07:26:58] <uGoMobi> but I need to use same logic but use panel height
[07:27:23] <uGoMobi> with same logic I mean... reduce with padding and border
[07:27:42] <arschmitz> ok so have it accept a panel param and if true use panel height indtead of screen height?
[07:28:06] <uGoMobi> yes something like that
[07:28:19] <arschmitz> ok
[07:28:51] <uGoMobi> the parameter should be the height which should be used for the calculation: getScreenHeight() or panel height
[07:36:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so you dont want it to be a bool?
[07:37:06] <arschmitz> i was going to have it be a boolean and if true it will use $( ".ui-panel-open" ).height() ?
[07:37:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how can I pass the height I want it to use for the calculation?
[07:37:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no it shouldn't use that value
[07:37:31] <arschmitz> oh i see i thought you wanted to just use panel height instead of window height
[07:37:43] <arschmitz> i gotca no problem just a sec ill change it
[07:38:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the panel itself is set to 100% height
[07:38:26] <uGoMobi> so that is useless
[07:38:30] <arschmitz> yeah wasent really thinking about it lol
[07:38:34] <uGoMobi> we wrap panel contents in a div
[07:38:48] <arschmitz> just a sec an ill push the updates
[07:38:50] <uGoMobi> and we need to use .outerHeight() of that div
[07:38:53] <uGoMobi> cool
[07:42:07] <arschmitz> ok all done just pushed
[07:43:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok great thanks
[07:43:34] <arschmitz> not a problem

[07:44:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if you need me to adjust anything just let me know but now you can just use $.mobile.resetActivePageHeight();
[07:44:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just thought about one problem... panel position function is bound to throttled resize as well

[07:52:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: can you look at this maybe im blind but i dont see a missing semi colon? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L297
[07:52:41] * uGoMobi looking
[07:53:18] <JamesMGreene> Dear room: Any Adobe devs here right now?
[07:54:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: never mind i see the problem
[07:58:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so now jsut pass nothing to use getScreenHeight() or a value to use that instead
[08:01:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw the code, perfect
[08:01:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sweet glad i remembered my first ever PR lol
[08:01:40] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:01:56] <arschmitz> johnbender: shot it down but hey something from it was usefull
[08:02:17] <uGoMobi> :)
[08:02:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: really just remembering that the function existed ha ha 
[08:02:46] <johnbender> arschmitz: what did I shoot down?
[08:02:57] <arschmitz> my first ever PR like a year ago lol
[08:03:08] <johnbender> ah, sorry :(
[08:03:15] <arschmitz> ( you were rightful to do so )
[08:04:03] <arschmitz> no no i was just saying actually writing it ended up being usefull because it caused me to now remember the existance fo the resetActivePageHeight() function in navigation
[08:04:21] <arschmitz> johnbender: no reason to be sorry at all
[08:04:23] <JamesMGreene> Any devs who work for Adobe here right now?
[08:05:15] <arschmitz> johnbender: ^^
[08:09:23] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: I do, why?
[08:10:16] * johnbender is a tad suspicious.
[08:10:17] <JamesMGreene> I'm working on an OSS project called ZeroClipboard and we have running into a particular problem using the Flash Clipboard API on Linux OSes
[08:10:36] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: this isn't the place for that question nor will I be able to answer it
[08:10:56] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: by chance I run linux but I'm not on the Flash team
[08:11:04] <JamesMGreene> Can you refer me to a better place/email/team?
[08:11:07] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1072: NOW UNSTABLE in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1072/
[08:11:10] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: I have no idea
[08:11:33] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: keep in mind that 99% of the employees at Adobe _don't_ work on flash
[08:11:37] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: the support forums?
[08:11:46] <JamesMGreene> Well
[08:11:54] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: one side note, they don't support flash on linux anymore
[08:12:06] <johnbender> and they never did for the most part on Linux
[08:12:07] <JamesMGreene> The question is probably more intimate with the Flash internals than the average support forum question
[08:12:14] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: that's one place to start
[08:12:20] <johnbender> they can probably elevate it from there
[08:12:26] <johnbender> otherwise I have no idea
[08:13:42] <JamesMGreene> OK, will do
[08:14:15] <JamesMGreene> See the real trouble is that a deprecated Flash 9 API works correctly, whereas the Flash 10+ alternate API does not (on Linux)
[08:14:42] <JamesMGreene> So I'm hoping to find out what the difference is internally, and if it would be possible for someone to bridge the gap in a future release
[08:14:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the changes in panel.js broke some things
[08:15:09] <JamesMGreene> Anyway, thanks for getting me started johnbender
[08:15:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: whats busted it passed all the tests and i clicked around a bit but nothing to intensive lol
[08:19:44] <gseguin> good morning
[08:19:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nevermind... there were some things already broken, but they way they are broken looks a bit different now ;)
[08:20:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I look at it when I work on the fix
[08:20:09] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[08:20:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh ok cool long as i didnt break anything lol
[08:20:30] <arschmitz> morning gseguin
[08:22:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you might have... http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/panels/panel-nav-form-fixed.html the page min-height is not set correctly 
[08:23:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ignore the footer when you open panel there... that's a markup problem (no data-role="footer" but placed outside ui-content)
[08:23:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: something is weird on that page the footer turns black like panel when you open it
[08:23:59] <arschmitz> lol ha ha
[08:24:07] <uGoMobi> yeah 
[08:24:18] <uGoMobi> I have that fixed local
[08:24:30] <arschmitz> ok so something is wrong with the panel height?
[08:24:31] <uGoMobi> push when I made some other changes to the demo
[08:24:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no
[08:25:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when you visit that page the page min-height should be screen height
[08:25:20] <arschmitz> oh ok just a sec
[08:25:21] <uGoMobi> but this doesn't work
[08:26:43] <arschmitz> hmm very strange the function works when run in the console and there are no errors
[08:27:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: intresting something is passing that function a param already
[08:28:02] <arschmitz> even though it didnt accept them before!
[08:28:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its getting passed an event object
[08:29:59] <uGoMobi> aha
[08:30:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: then let's forget about the param and just expose
[08:30:36] <arschmitz> uuGoMobi: its fine already fixed
[08:30:45] <uGoMobi> even better :)
[08:30:47] <arschmitz> i just check the type of the param to make sure its a number
[08:32:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just make sure you pass a number not a string lol
[08:32:23] <uGoMobi> ok

[08:34:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: had not expected it to be reciving a param already since it was not set to accept them lol
[08:35:29] <uGoMobi> yeah i can imagine, wouldn't have expected that either
[08:36:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there all fixed
[08:36:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah looks good now, thanks
[08:36:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that page still looks too tall but i think thats the markup issue you mentioned
[08:37:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: among other issues, but I am fixing that now
[08:37:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool
[08:37:34] <uGoMobi> that's why I need to set diff min-height for page when panel is open
[08:37:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: panels really turned into quite a project
[08:37:54] <uGoMobi> lol yeah
[08:37:59] <arschmitz> just about everyone has been pretty involved in it at some point
[08:38:05] <uGoMobi> seems so simple... show/hide a div
[08:38:21] <arschmitz> if all we wanted was overlay it would be lol
[08:39:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im really a huge fan of the panels though such a nice ui component and i think we have done them really well
[08:40:17] <uGoMobi> I agree
[08:41:03] <arschmitz> i have had them live on a project for a couple weeks lol and everyone loves them their fav part of the site lol
[08:41:27] <arschmitz> great for an inventory search filter
[08:42:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: or any search filter lol
[08:42:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh i saw you comment on an issue about ui tabs earlier and something about themeing right?
[08:43:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: theming?
[08:43:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I did comment on tab widget
[08:44:28] <arschmitz> yeah they said something about how they wished it would use our theming 
[08:44:37] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[08:44:39] <arschmitz> there is a really easy and good looking way to pull that off already
[08:45:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we plan on adding it for 1.4 anyway
[08:45:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i know
[08:45:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: iv been using tabs for a while i just use a nav bar for the tab links and it works awesome and is themeable
[08:47:33] <uGoMobi> yes might be good idea to use our navbar widget for it when we develop that tab widget
[08:47:48] <uGoMobi> bit of UI and bit of our own :)
[08:47:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: super basic example of it http://billdodgewholesale.com/wholesale_inventory/4dr%20Car/Used/2006/Mazda/Mazda6/_/westbrook/Maine/1YVHP80D065M52651/4dr%20Car_2006_Mazda_Mazda6__westbrookMaine_1YVHP80D065M52651.php

[08:51:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pretty simple indeed
[08:51:57] <uGoMobi> we looked into using collapsible for it but thats too complicated

[09:07:07] <johnbender> gseguin: the upgrade?
[09:07:12] <gseguin> johnbender: Curious about why you kept the Makefile around?
[09:07:16] <gseguin> yes
[09:07:33] <johnbender> gseguin: migration
[09:07:38] <johnbender> gseguin: our build uses it
[09:07:44] <johnbender> and I'm sure someone out there expects it to be there
[09:08:05] <gseguin> seems redundant
[09:08:34] <johnbender> gseguin: remember I did this about a year ago
[09:08:40] <gseguin> true
[09:08:45] <johnbender> so now is probably a good time to take it out
[09:09:04] <gseguin> alright, that was my next question

[10:37:39] <_|Nix|_> I'm sorry I can't make today's meeting.
[10:44:30] <agcolom> toddmparker: we're having dinner in 15 min... Is it ok to keep my update for say after the first 20-30 mins?
[10:45:04] <agcolom> btw I have some good news to announce :-)
[10:45:56] <toddmparker> agcolom: sure!
[10:46:02] <toddmparker> can't wait to hear the news
[10:47:25] <toddmparker> all - are there any major issues that have come in from 1.3.0 beta that would be a blocker?
[10:48:53] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think we already fixed the 2 blocker issues
[10:51:10] <toddmparker> arschmitz: cool. do you have issues links handy?
[10:51:23] <johnbender> toddmparker: we need to discuss the android pushstate/replacestate
[10:51:35] <johnbender> or at least come to a consesus
[10:51:38] <toddmparker> ok johnbender 
[10:51:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker: just looked at all the new open issues and its almost all suggestions execpt one that looks simple i can probably take care of 
[10:51:46] <johnbender> we could do that after the meeting though since it's semi technical
[10:51:50] <toddmparker> agendify it
[10:52:02] <toddmparker> ok, sure
[10:52:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5453 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5445 were both blocker
[10:52:39] <arschmitz> both are closed fixed

[12:29:39] <toddmparker> just added this issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5477
[12:30:05] <toddmparker> johnbender and gseguin - didn't we look at the package.json generation a while back?
[12:31:04] <gseguin> I think I recall something like that
[12:31:14] <gseguin> don't know what happened though
[13:08:31] <johnbender> toddmparker: yes, and I worked on it for a w hile
[13:08:36] <johnbender> fairly well mothballed by now
[13:08:52] <johnbender> gseguin: that might be another good one to tackle when you get the chance
[13:09:10] <johnbender> gseguin: as I understand it, discovery is the primary purpose
[13:09:39] <johnbender> toddmparker: ^ so the only thing we might want to expose is the standalone stuff like the navigate method/vmouse 
[13:09:55] <johnbender> otherwise the whole framework should be treated a "plugin"
[13:27:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Re: That multipage document regression: I'm noticing that when the current location is http://server/path/file.html#internalPage and you click on a link hreffed "#page1" where #page1 is the id of the first page in the doc, it ends up calling go() with /path/file.html, which in turn ends up calling path.squash( "/path/file.html" ), which then returns http://server/path/file.html#internalPage ... this, in turn, ends up in th
[13:28:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, I'm wondering about two things: Why, when you click a URL of "#page1" it ends up calling go with /path/file.html and why does path.squash( /path/file.html ) result in an absolute URL that contains the hash of the current internal page?
[13:29:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm going to test whether passing "#page1" to go() will result in correct behaviour, including suppression of the hash (since it's the first page).
[13:35:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nope. No suppression ... so much for the easy way out :)
[13:37:48] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm already modifying the package.json for grunt
[13:38:02] <gseguin> johnbender: moving all the grunt thing into devDependencies
[13:38:25] <gseguin> I'm foreseeing that version.txt is going to disappear
[13:38:34] <gseguin> we'll use package.json for that 
[13:38:59] <gseguin> there is a grunt plugin to bump version, have to look into it
[13:42:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, so the same (incorrect?) href ends up in $.mobile.Navigator.popstate when it checks event.originalEvent.state ...

[13:56:02] <johnbender> BAM! https://twitter.com/johnbender/status/292026910106587136
[13:56:10] <johnbender> I've got 49 more of those if you suckers want tone
[13:56:12] <johnbender> *want one
[13:56:13] <johnbender> lolol
[13:56:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, I believe it boils down to the "TODO all this crap is terrible, clean it up" portion of path.squash() :)
[13:56:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: You re-attached the preservedHash to the path, but you don't need to do that in this case.
[13:56:58] <gseguin> NERD ALERT!
[13:57:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes the squash and hash handling is the worst crap ever
[13:58:58] <gseguin> johnbender: if I give you a bunch of zip files, could you put them up on the CDN?
[13:59:14] <arschmitz> johnbender: awesome sticker
[14:00:55] <johnbender> gseguin: what for?
[14:01:31] <johnbender> gseguin: is this something you need to test? we should probably just get your keys on the cdn or some such
[14:01:33] <gseguin> to link to from the download builder page
[14:01:55] <gseguin> nope I've got them in a dropbox folder
[14:02:01] <gseguin> let me share that with ya
[14:02:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: preservedHash = (uri.hash || path.parseLocation().hash); ... I believe if we omitted the latter hash, it would make this a function solely of its input parameters - well, aside from establishing resolutionUrl at the top, but that's just a user convenience.
[14:03:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll give that a shot and see if I blow up the world.
[14:03:38] <gseguin> johnbender: you've got mail
[14:03:45] <_|Nix|_> ^H^H^H^H^H^Hunit tests.
[14:04:02] <gseguin> it would be great to upload them in this structure
[14:04:19] <gseguin> so it's easy for me to generate a dynamic link on the builder page
[14:05:05] <gseguin> toddmparker: still there?

[14:31:43] <arschmitz> johnbender: where did you get the ski bombinators sticker?
[14:59:10] <johnbender> arschmitz: I made them at stickermule
[15:03:19] <johnbender> gseguin: meant to say one sec/minute
[15:03:25] <johnbender> gseguin: what exactly do you need me to do?
[15:05:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I commented out that line, and the unit tests still pass, and the issue is resolved.
[15:05:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: fucking ship it
[15:05:38] <johnbender> :)
[15:05:40] <_|Nix|_> :)
[15:06:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I'll make a unit test for this situation, at any rate.
[15:06:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: brilliant
[15:06:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks for working through my mess :(
[15:06:46] <johnbender> such a fucking bramble in there
[15:07:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP. Once again, I'm doing things one nav sequence at a time :)
[15:24:35] <gseguin> johnbender: I would like you to upload the content of the directory onto our CDN
[15:24:47] <gseguin> because custom builds don't contain images
[15:24:58] <gseguin> and people have been complaining about it
[15:25:16] <gseguin> so I made a zip of the images for each release
[15:25:27] <gseguin> put them in that dropbox folder per release
[15:25:51] <gseguin> and once they're up on the CDN, I can link to them on the builder page
[15:26:01] <gseguin> does that make sense?
[15:27:02] <johnbender> gseguin: yes!
[15:27:03] <johnbender> thanks
[15:27:13] <johnbender> gseguin: sorry I just need to know before I put anything on the server :)
[15:27:49] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm, have we put images up on the CDN before?
[15:28:06] <gseguin> these are not images
[15:28:10] <gseguin> they're zips
[15:28:16] <johnbender> either way
[15:28:19] <johnbender> non text content
[15:28:29] <gseguin> no we havent
[15:28:30] <johnbender> I suppose we put the docs up there eh?
[15:28:43] <gseguin> true
[15:28:51] <johnbender> gnarf: is it ok to put zip files on the CDN?
[15:28:54] <johnbender> just double checking
[15:28:59] <gnarf> yup
[15:29:03] <johnbender> gseguin: it costs someone money so I figure I should double check
[15:29:04] <johnbender> cool
[15:29:07] <johnbender> that was easy :)
[15:29:26] <gseguin> what's the current directory structure on the CDN?
[15:29:45] <gseguin> wait
[15:30:00] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I have to figure out how this fits
[15:30:02] <johnbender> gimme a second
[15:30:48] <gseguin> so for instance the current bundle lives at /mobile/1.3.0-beta.1
[15:31:05] <gseguin> I want the corresponding image zip to live at the same level
[15:32:17] <johnbender> gseguin: /mobile/1.3.0-beta.1/jquery.mobile.images.zip right?
[15:32:39] <gseguin> yeah unless you see a problem not having the version in the filename
[15:32:57] <johnbender> gseguin: well that would fit with the convention of the other files
[15:32:57] <johnbender> eg
[15:33:14] <johnbender> jquery.mobile-1.3.0-beta.1.zip
[15:33:28] <johnbender> gseguin: can we automate this as part of the deploy
[15:33:34] <johnbender> or is that what you're working on
[15:34:04] <gseguin> I don't care, as long as the version string matches the branch/tag name

[15:34:18] <gseguin> let me change that in the dropbox folder then
[15:35:17] <gseguin> johnbender: done
[15:35:45] <johnbender> gseguin: so we should definitely add this to the build then right?
[15:35:54] <gseguin> oh wow the images zip size did x10 in 1.3
[15:36:04] <johnbender> o.O
[15:36:18] <gseguin> yes we should
[15:36:32] <gseguin> might generate it manually for 1.3
[15:36:44] <gseguin> since there is no point working on the current build system
[15:37:54] <johnbender> gseguin: ok I'll upload the ones you have in  there now
[15:38:01] <johnbender> gseguin: or just 1.3
[15:38:18] <gseguin> all of them please
[15:38:44] <gseguin> on the builder page, I'll generate a link that points to the right zip depending on the version the user has selected

[15:41:16] <johnbender> gseguin: 1.1-stable?
[15:42:04] <gseguin> ha!
[15:42:16] <gseguin> because we allow users to build from branches
[15:42:29] <gseguin> so that's 1.1.2pre
[15:42:42] <johnbender> kk
[15:43:00] <gseguin> the reality is it hasn't changed 
[15:43:03] <gseguin> from 1.1
[15:43:27] <gseguin> so if you don't want to create that dir that's fine I'll create an exception
[15:44:00] <johnbender> yah we probably shouldn't do that in the future
[15:44:11] <johnbender> still not clear on why 1.2pre is in there
[15:44:18] <johnbender> I feel like that's a mistake
[15:45:29] <gseguin> you mean just tagged versions available in the builder?
[15:49:52] <johnbender> gseguin: sorry, fooling around with irssi
[15:49:57] <johnbender> so what should we do about that last one?
[15:50:07] <johnbender> you tell me and I'll do it
[15:50:09] <johnbender> doesn't matter
[15:50:49] <gseguin> don't worry
[15:51:05] <gseguin> I'll remove 1.1.2pre from the builder
[15:57:57] <johnbender> gseguin: good call
[15:58:11] <johnbender> gseguin: otherwise you should be good to go
[15:58:36] <johnbender> gseguin: code.jquery.com/mobile/<version>/jquery.mobile.images-<version>.zip
[15:58:44] <johnbender> gseguin: we should definitely get that into the build for you
[15:59:00] <gseguin> W00T! got the thing to build with grunt 0.4
[15:59:07] <johnbender> gseguin: super nice
[15:59:33] <gseguin> funny thing is that modules are not in the same order
[15:59:50] <gseguin> (it's using requirejs 2.1.2)
[16:05:46] <johnbender> hmm
[16:05:53] <johnbender> gseguin: lol on cue
[16:06:03] <johnbender> (mr burke joined the channel)
[16:06:13] <gseguin> the file size is exactly the same
[16:06:25] <gseguin> so I'm not expecting any bad surprise
[16:07:00] <RWhitbeck> I keep running into people who think 1.2 css is buggy cause the edit icon isn't there.  I wonder if they somehow are stubling onto the test docs and thinking that is the latest documentation. 
[16:07:23] <gseguin> jrburke: was there a change between 1.0.8 and 2.1.2 that would cause modules to be dumped in a slightly different order ?
[16:08:34] <jrburke> gseguin: there is a difference in how they initialized/when their factory function is called: https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/wiki/Upgrading-to-RequireJS-2.0#wiki-delayed
[16:09:36] <jrburke> gseguin: the other change that may be of note going from 1.0 to 2.1: https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/wiki/Upgrading-to-RequireJS-2.1#wiki-breaking-async
[16:11:22] <gseguin> cool, thanks jrburke
[16:41:37] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm thinking of splitting test between those that need http:// and those that don't
[16:42:25] <gseguin> just in terms of test targets
[16:47:38] <johnbender> gseguin: no one would complain
[16:48:13] <gseguin> it's testiiiiiinnnngg!
[16:49:57] <gseguin> alright, I'm out. See you guys tomorrow
