[08:24:02] <Wilto> Morning, folks.
[09:56:34] <Wilto> Here’s something fun.
[09:57:23] <Wilto> I’m sorting out some recent issues with checkboxes/radios, and buttonMarkup.
[09:58:16] <Wilto> With one on the page, buttonMarkup is called once. Two checkboxes, four calls. Three checkboxes, nine calls. Four, sixteen calls.
[09:59:33] <Wilto> This is, in my opinion, Less Than Ideal.
[09:59:59] <Wilto> kinblas, johnbender: Any thoughts on the above?
[10:00:33] <kinblas> shouldn't buttonMarkup be called once for each?
[10:00:43] <Wilto> Mmyep.
[10:00:49] <Wilto> I would think so, anyway.
[10:01:24] * kinblas takes a quick look
[10:01:53] <Wilto> And the script will bail immediately on redundant calls, of course, but… Still, something about “a never ending fractal of function calls” doesn’t sound particularly performant.
[10:03:51] <Wilto> kinblas: I’m wading around in buttonMarkup today anyway, so don’t worry too much about digging in. Just wanted to see if that rang any bells.
[10:04:07] <kinblas> Wilto: nope
[10:04:25] <kinblas> Wilto: if you have a test case online I could tell you right quick :-)
[10:06:06] <Wilto> I do not. Just something I noticed while getting the check/radio icons sorted.
[10:06:14] <Wilto> I’ll slap something together once that’s sorted.
[10:09:12] <Wilto> Ah man, scratch all of the above, kinblas and johnbender.
[10:10:15] <kinblas> Wilto: ??
[10:10:30] <kinblas> Wilto: oh, are you using Chrome to debug?
[10:10:46] * kinblas notes Chrome has that annoying console output duplicating bug
[10:11:11] <Wilto> This comes as a shock to me, but it turns out that multiple identical IDs on a page will cause weird script things.
[10:11:17] <Wilto> The More You Know 彡☆
[10:13:30] <Wilto> ButtonMarkup is generally ’effed all of a sudden.
[10:28:25] <Wilto> Semi-’effed.
[10:35:39] <johnbender> Wilto: yah that needs to be tested better and handled with care in the meantime
[10:36:00] <Wilto> johnbender: Hitting this sucker with a fine-toothed comb now.
[10:36:08] <Wilto> Including New and Exciting Tests!

[10:57:50] <Wilto> Anybody desperately need me on the BB check-in?
[10:58:14] <johnbender> toddparker: I was planning to call in and work while listening

[11:42:49] <johnbender> script tags won't load at the bottom of the body
[11:43:03] <johnbender> at least in chrome they don't
[11:44:00] <johnbender> I'm not knowledgeable enough about how that's supposed to opperate, but at the very least in that case the docs are innacurate

[14:00:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added ‘Kitchen Sink’ test page, for global testing. - Mat Marquis
[14:02:50] <Wilto> johnbender: Could stand your eyes on that kitchen sink page, as I’m guessing I put it together wrong somehow.
[14:05:03] <johnbender> Wilto: link?
[14:05:19] <Wilto> Oh, just pushed it.
[14:05:38] <johnbender> Wilto: tests?
[14:05:42] <Wilto> …Can we get to the tests on /test?
[14:05:48] <johnbender> yerp
[14:07:06] <johnbender> Wilto: is there a dialog sized select in there somewhere?
[14:07:17] <Wilto> Ah, no.
[14:07:49] <Wilto> I just grabbed an assortment of things—I only have the one test in there now, ensuring nothing gets a class that contains “undefined.”
[14:08:05] <Wilto> Since that was popping up in various places.
[14:35:39] <johnbender> Wilto: that'll be fine to steal for phonegap application
[14:35:52] <Wilto> Sweet, glad it helps.
[14:36:03] <johnbender> Wilto: heck yah, thanks for doing all the hard work
[14:36:15] <Wilto> If you can think of any other tests that would be appropriate in there, give the word and I’ll put them together. I could stand the practice.
[14:36:47] <johnbender> Wilto: once I get it working in phonegap I'll play with it and let you know
[14:38:53] <johnbender> gseguin: are you around?
[14:42:54] <Wilto> We spend a lot of time pinging one another in here, and it’s not very efficient. I’m sure you’re all thinking the same thing I am: jQuery Mobile Team Communicator Watches.
