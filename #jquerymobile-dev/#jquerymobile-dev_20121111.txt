[12:21:22] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Correct.
[12:21:33] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: $.mobile.selectmenu ...
[12:24:01] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Thx! also I'm wondering whether there is a mistake on http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dialog/events.html
[12:24:18] <agcolom> (and bind should be replaced with dialog in the code example)
[12:24:44] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hold on ... my mouse is broken :(
[12:26:03] <agcolom> oh no!
[12:44:38] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The code in the example is correct.
[12:57:33] <agcolom> ok, sorry I was helping with homework...
[12:57:48] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender Are we running the latest and greatest npm and phantomjs on the buildbot? I couldn't reproduce the random timeouts on a machine I had set up with phantomjs 1.7.0 and npm 1.1.65 whose sole task was to run the unit tests in a loop.
[12:57:49] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[12:58:56] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: so it's $( ".selector" ).bind({
[12:58:56] <agcolom>    create: function(event, ui) { ... }
[12:58:56] <agcolom> });
[12:59:00] <agcolom> and not
[12:59:11] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender I figure if we were to upgrade and the problem were to go away, I could take my time on my local machine. I'd continue tracking down the problem, because if there's a scenario where the code behaves incorrectly, it will almost certainly come back to haunt us in the future.
[12:59:12] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[12:59:23] <agcolom> $( ".selector" ).dialog({
[12:59:31] <agcolom> create: function(event, ui) { ... }
[12:59:36] <agcolom> });
[12:59:38] <agcolom> ?
[13:00:01] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Actually, according to the latest from core, it should be $( ".selector" ).on( { create: function( event, ui ) { ... } );
[13:00:07] <agcolom> it's just that all the other widget use the widget name and not bind.
[13:00:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... and not ... .bind({})
[13:00:35] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hmmm ... weird ...
[13:00:57] <agcolom> sorry, all the other widgets except popup
[13:01:10] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, because I wrote the docs for popup :)
[13:01:18] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-events.html
[13:01:24] <agcolom> yeah ;)
[13:02:00] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/checkboxes/events.html
[13:02:07] <_|Nix|_> Weird ... AFAIK, .bind() is the canonical way to attach handlers to events ...
[13:02:23] <_|Nix|_> ... and as of core version 1.8 or something, it's .on().
[13:02:31] <_|Nix|_> .bind() is being deprecated.
[13:03:09] <agcolom> yes, I'm totally confused!
[13:03:13] <_|Nix|_> ... but you can ask in UI if the syntax .widgetname({ eventName: function() {} }) can be used to attach event handlers.
[13:03:25] <_|Nix|_> It looks like it can be so used.
[13:03:55] <agcolom> ok, will check with Scott G, thx
[13:12:59] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Actually, .widgetname is wrong.
[13:13:03] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/475/edit
[13:13:24] <_|Nix|_> In that example, if you leave the code untouched, the event handler will not be run when you stop sliding.
[13:13:51] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, if you change the word .slider to .bind or .on (as I describe in the comments), the event handler will be run.
[13:14:22] <_|Nix|_> This tells me that, in order to successfully attach an event handler to an event triggered by a widget, you must use .on() or .bind().
[13:15:21] <_|Nix|_> ... and looking at the code in jquery.ui.widget.js, .widgetname() is defined as .widgetname( options ) ... so, if you use .widgetname( anything ) then "anything" is expected to be a list of options, not a list of event handlers.
[13:15:27] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ^
[13:16:17] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Thanks a lot for that... so it looks like the docs are wrong then :(
[13:16:38] <uGoMobi> evening _|Nix|_ agcolom
[13:16:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[13:17:17] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Indeed ... I suspect the only reason nobody's complained so far is that most people who read the doc already know how to attach event handlers, and they're only interested in the names of the events.
[13:17:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hammering away at the unit tests ... I'm up to listview ...
[13:17:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice!
[13:18:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks for improving those changes I made
[13:19:06] <agcolom> yes... the api docs of ui does not have code examples for this. I'm tempted to remove them for now and have a note on how to attach event handlers, just like ui.
[13:19:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP. I figured if we used a behaviour it would make our widgets consistent, and who knows ... maybe we can apply this pattern to other group-type widgets.
[13:19:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah good idea to re-use the code
[13:20:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and most of the unit test fixing is basically s/ui-btn-corner-(left|top)/ui-first-child/g and s/ui-btn-corner-(right|bottom)/ui-last-child/g ...
[13:21:19] <uGoMobi> nice regex :)
[13:27:44] * _|Nix|_ go bed now - L8R ...
[13:28:27] <uGoMobi> good night _|Nix|_
[13:28:38] <agcolom> Goodnight _|Nix|_
[13:29:16] <agcolom> Hello Jasper :-)
[13:29:27] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[13:30:09] <agcolom> looks like we've discovered an error in the docs...
[13:31:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: about the event binding?
[13:31:30] <agcolom> yes
[13:32:27] <agcolom> there was an inconsistency so I checked with Gabriel, and it looks like the use of the widgetname may be incorrect.
[13:32:32] <uGoMobi> yeah that doesn't look correct
[13:32:45] <uGoMobi> it is incorrect
[13:33:03] <agcolom> so how come it's all over the place in the docs?
[13:33:19] <agcolom> might be a copy paste of an original error?
[13:33:20] <uGoMobi> I dunno
[13:33:38] <uGoMobi> looks like somebody mixed methods and events
[13:33:59] <agcolom> That doesn't sound good!
[13:34:10] <agcolom> (As I'm using this for the api docs!)
[13:34:36] <uGoMobi> it's not everywhere, right? I see at the form widgets
[13:36:41] <jqcommit> [api.jquerymobile.com] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Qy2c0w
[13:36:42] <jqcommit> api.jquerymobile.com/master dcc76e4 Anne-Gaelle Colom: using widget name to bind even is incorrect
[13:37:03] <agcolom> yes, dialog and popups are good
[13:38:33] <agcolom> should there not be a popup create event?
[13:38:44] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/events.html
[13:40:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it looks like it is mostly the "create" event of form widgets that is wrong
[13:40:41] <agcolom> listview has it also
[13:40:55] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-events.html
[13:41:03] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:41:34] <uGoMobi> almost makes me wonder if this somehow is not wrong, but works
[13:41:56] <agcolom> yes, very strange...
[13:42:02] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-events.html
[13:42:24] <agcolom> yes...
[13:42:44] <agcolom> Maybe we could have that as an item at the next meeting?
[13:43:01] <agcolom> unless we can figure this out this week...
[13:43:38] <agcolom> this is probably something johnbender would know.
[13:44:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, just ask tomorrow
[13:45:10] <agcolom> Gabriel created this jsbin: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/475/edit
[13:45:57] <agcolom> if you use the widget name, the even is not fired. If you replace it with on or bind (http://jsbin.com/uzaret/477/edit) it works...
[13:48:31] <uGoMobi> yes, I would be very surprised if it would have worked
[13:49:19] <uGoMobi> there is a mistake in the markup but that doesn't make a difference http://jsbin.com/uzaret/478/edit
[13:56:13] <agcolom> ok, thx!
[13:56:26] <agcolom> Bedtime now for me too...
[13:57:22] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[13:57:54] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper!
[13:58:02] <agcolom> thank you !
[21:00:00] <gnarf> any devs awake?
[21:00:09] <gnarf> curious what version of $.widget is in mobile stable
[21:02:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't dictate teh versions there
[21:02:38] <bot-t> (8 hours 4 mins 50 secs ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender Are we running the latest and greatest npm and phantomjs on the buildbot? I couldn't reproduce the random timeouts on a machine I had set up with phantomjs 1.7.0 and npm 1.1.65 whose sole task was to run the unit tests in a loop.

[21:03:05] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ I don't dictate teh versions there, I could check them and let you know
[21:03:05] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[21:08:54] <gnarf> johnbender: do you know
[21:09:09] <johnbender> gnarf: 1.9ish
[21:09:15] <johnbender> is it not in the file??
[21:09:31] <johnbender> gnarf: it's at the top of the widget
[21:09:37] <johnbender> 1.9.0-beta.1
[21:10:01] <johnbender> would be nice to upgrade to the release version provided nothing drastic changed because of bug fixes
[21:19:57] <gnarf> i don't there there is much diff
[21:21:54] <gnarf> *think there
