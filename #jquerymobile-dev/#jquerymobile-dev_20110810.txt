[00:00:48] * gseguin blinks at "day change"
[00:01:12] <gseguin> I should go to bed
[00:01:56] <gseguin> _nickel: let's continue that discussion tomorrow, it's a jQM day for me tomorrow
[00:02:03] <_nickel> gseguin: nice!
[00:02:24] <gseguin> get some rest
[00:02:34] <gseguin> ttyl
[00:02:42] <_nickel> gseguin: peace!
[08:23:34] <gseguin> good morning
[08:24:39] <gseguin> hey toddparker
[08:50:27] <_nickel> scottjehl: kinblas: gseguin: I think the select decouple is pretty much done
[08:50:44] <_nickel> kinblas: I'm leaving the plugin registration/modification as an outstanding item
[08:50:56] <_nickel> though I thought about it a fair amount last night
[08:51:42] <gseguin> you want to leave that for pos 1.0?
[08:51:48] <gseguin> *post
[08:51:53] <_nickel> possibly
[08:52:12] <_nickel> though I would like to do mem and perf profiling before 1.0 and if that comes up as a major issue then we might need to address it
[08:58:14] <_nickel> gseguin: clearly an email is required :D
[08:58:49] <gseguin> I believe that will work better, yes ;)
[08:59:19] <gseguin> it's lunch time on the east coast, isn't it?
[09:02:24] <_nickel> yassir
[09:21:06] <gseguin> _nickel: there's no tag for 1.0b2 ?
[09:21:17] <_nickel> dunno thats what it looks like
[09:21:45] <gseguin> that's not very convenient
[09:27:43] <kinblas> _nickel: so who's fixing that? :-)
[09:28:10] <_nickel> kinblas: dunno I don't do the tagging but you guys saw my email + link eh?
[09:28:15] <kinblas> if we know the date and the last checkin that made it
[09:28:19] <_nickel> you can just tage a commit after the fact
[09:28:27] <_nickel> *tag
[09:28:43] <kinblas> I think John R. normally does it
[09:28:47] <_nickel> right
[09:53:15] <scottjehl> heyo
[09:54:22] <scottjehl> I tagged the last one. Any of us that has time can just do it
[09:54:30] <scottjehl> we need to update version.txt too
[09:56:19] <gseguin> alright will do
[09:58:21] <gseguin> scottjehl: 1.0b3pre, right?
[09:58:38] <scottjehl> yep! that's great
[10:06:33] <gseguin> I based 1.0b2 tag on John R.'s commit of verstion.txt
[10:06:44] <gseguin> if that's  not it let me know
[10:09:45] <_nickel> scottjehl: gseguin: toddparker: kinblas: stepping out to take my daughter to a doctors appointment
[10:09:54] <_nickel> when I get back I can merge the select decouple
[10:10:05] <_nickel> and then i was going to start work on setting up jenkins at adobe
[10:10:15] <kinblas> werd
[10:30:13] <scottjehl> nice.
[10:30:18] <scottjehl> anyone able to tag b2?
[10:35:35] <gseguin> scottjehl: I did
[10:35:43] <scottjehl> thanks!!
[10:35:54] <scottjehl> also, thanks for the bday wishes, gseguin :)
[10:35:59] <gseguin> scottjehl: I based 1.0b2 tag on John R.'s commit of verstion.txt
[10:37:20] <gseguin> scottjehl: you're welcome!
[10:47:33] <scottjehl> great
[10:48:25] <scottjehl> hey everyone, congrats on being shortlisted for two .Net awards: http://www.thenetawards.com/index.php#vote
[11:20:32] <gseguin> kinblas: great color theme ;)
[11:20:59] <kinblas> lol
[11:21:05] <kinblas> I color by numbers
[11:21:36] <gseguin> I don't even bother by numbers, I use blue and orange :P
[11:22:32] <kinblas> lol
[11:23:03] <kinblas> this transitions stuff is such a damn headache ... and just reaffirms that we have no real control over rendering
[11:23:21] <gseguin> I know, right?
[11:23:27] <kinblas> scottjehl: ooh up against Dreamweaver CS5.5
[11:23:49] <scottjehl> a conflict of interest, I see
[11:23:55] <scottjehl> :)
[11:24:48] <toddparker> hey guys, sorry i was away
[11:24:51] <toddparker> happy birthday gseguin
[11:25:03] <toddparker> col news on the .net awards
[11:25:05] <gseguin> toddparker: what?
[11:25:10] <toddparker> hahahaha
[11:25:19] * gseguin has a new birth date
[11:25:22] <toddparker> quick read, though scott said it was your bday
[11:25:29] <toddparker> two birthday, 2 cakes
[11:25:35] <gseguin> yay!
[11:26:23] <gseguin> kinblas: FWIW, transitions works 1000x better on Android 2.3 from your isolated test cases
[11:26:46] <kinblas> gseguin: ok I needed some other eyes on that ... I think I've been staring too much that I lose perspective
[11:26:53] <gseguin> toddparker: but thank you though
[11:26:55] <kinblas> it's all chunky compared to iOS
[11:27:09] <kinblas> it's scott's bday isn't it?
[11:27:23] <gseguin> kinblas:  yes scott's
[11:27:43] <kinblas> scottjehl: happy birthday ... you make me feel old
[11:29:52] <scottjehl> hey thanks. and stop it. :)
[11:30:39] <scottjehl> so transitions: have we done any testing on newly -prefixed browsers ?
[11:30:52] <scottjehl> like... does this include opera and firefox now?
[11:31:25] * gseguin tests on FF/mac and Opera/mac
[11:31:35] <toddparker> kin - on ios5, the transitions seem more buttery than keyframe
[11:31:38] <toddparker> same duration?
[11:33:05] <gseguin> FF/mac: transitions: great - keyframes: not working
[11:33:36] <scottjehl> awesome. yeah, we never did keyframes for non webkit so that's expected
[11:33:45] * kinblas likes butter
[11:34:01] <kinblas> ok so it sounds like folks are digging the transitions approach
[11:34:29] <scottjehl> so what does it do to our filesize?
[11:34:36] <scottjehl> smaller overall?
[11:34:36] <kinblas> I've just been testing and trying to figure out if we can do more to prevent flashing ... if folks are happy, we can land some of this on the HEAD
[11:34:39] <kinblas> just let me know
[11:34:45] <gseguin> Opera/Mac: transitions: want to work but not there yet - keyframes: not working
[11:34:48] <kinblas> I would suggest playing around with it a bit more
[11:35:17] <kinblas> I just need external (not me) feedback :-)
[11:37:01] <kinblas> toddparker: You and scott have an iOS5 running on an actual device?
[11:37:09] <scottjehl> Todd does ya
[11:37:17] <kinblas> I need help confirming an apple bug
[11:37:26] <kinblas> for one of the issues I filed on our behalf
[11:37:38] <kinblas> but they want confirmation against iOS5 beta 5
[11:37:54] <kinblas> scottjehl: hence my question to you a few days back about the emulator
[11:38:33] <gseguin> kinblas: iOS5 on iPad2 here
[11:38:47] <kinblas> great!
[11:38:50] <gseguin> just upgraded to b5
[11:38:50] <kinblas> can you guys see this bug?
[11:38:51] <kinblas> https://bugreport.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/RadarWeb.woa/31/wo/slRpPGB63ubPEeUcjvsiag/5.83.28.0.9
[11:39:34] <kinblas> actually, if youcan't this is better
[11:39:35] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues#issue/785
[11:39:54] <gseguin> I can't see the apple bug
[11:39:56] <kinblas> I'll push a sample you guys can hit
[11:40:22] <toddparker>  do i need your login?
[11:40:51] <toddparker> k
[11:42:48] <toddparker> so kinblas, in my tests with those pages you emailed, the transitions are much smoother than keyframe on iPhone and iPad
[11:43:46] <kinblas> ok
[11:43:56] * gseguin is still typing the url
[11:43:58] <kinblas> thinking about it, transitions do less work
[11:44:08] <kinblas> gseguin: lol ... sorry I should bitly those
[11:44:18] <gseguin> :P
[11:44:28] <gseguin> I goo.gl them
[11:44:51] <kinblas> toddparker: transitions don't need to look up percentage rules in a keyframe and then update properties based on the current interval
[11:45:46] <toddparker> i LOVE kin's urls
[11:45:52] <toddparker> http://bit.ly/ohEDPD
[11:46:01] <toddparker> i typed it in once
[11:46:18] <toddparker> extra long name today kin
[11:46:40] <gseguin> so on iPad2 iOS5b5 transitions look good
[11:46:44] <toddparker> on our galaxy tab, i see the blink at the end but i'd say transitions are a tiny bit less blinky
[11:47:05] <gseguin> transitions do look to animate slower (though smoothly) than keyframes
[11:47:50] <kinblas> toddparker: gseguin: so if you guys can try this page out on your iOS5 devices and let me know the results, I can update apple
[11:47:51] <toddparker> that is true
[11:47:52] <kinblas> http://goo.gl/8QzeL
[11:47:55] * kinblas notes the short URL
[11:47:59] <toddparker> slower, but smoother
[11:48:19] <kinblas> instructions are on the page itself
[11:51:01] <toddparker> on that test page in iOS beta 4 (maybe 5?) I can dismiss the suggestion
[11:51:45] <kinblas> ok, that's a good thing :-)
[11:51:49] <gseguin> I don't even get the suggestion
[11:51:56] * kinblas runs on iOS4 just to make sure that test case still fails
[11:51:59] <toddparker> i said i'm up to dat, but i think i'm running 4
[11:52:07] <toddparker> good idea
[11:54:19] <gseguin> ok, if I erase everything and type "automeated" I get a "automated" suggestion  which I can dismiss
[11:54:19] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah hmmm I don't get the suggest either ... perhaps I shut off that feature?
[11:55:02] <kinblas> gseguin: ok following your recipe, I can get it to pop up, but I can't dismiss on iOS4.2.3
[11:55:08] <kinblas> so I guess it's fixed?
[11:55:19] <gseguin> I guess so
[11:55:40] <kinblas> so what version are you running?
[11:55:48] <kinblas> Todd is iOS5 beta 4
[11:55:54] <gseguin> beta5
[11:55:58] <kinblas> ok great!
[11:56:02] <kinblas> I'll reply to apple then
[11:56:07] <kinblas> and then update our issue
[11:56:18] <gseguin> beta4 is so outdated ;)
[11:56:50] <toddparker> heh
[11:57:21] <toddparker> playbook is smoother with keyframe animations btw
[11:57:32] <toddparker> they are complaining that jqm isn't performant
[11:57:40] <toddparker> but their devices can be wacky
[11:59:13] <kinblas> toddparker: not performant in what way?
[12:00:17] <scottjehl> they weren't clear on that part :/
[12:00:19] <gseguin> kinblas: are your transition using the same timing than keyframes?
[12:00:36] <kinblas> yes 350ms
[12:01:41] <kinblas> gseguin: why?
[12:02:15] <gseguin> I just was wondering if there was reason transitions appear slower
[12:02:35] <gseguin> and same easein, I'm guessing
[12:03:17] <kinblas> yup
[12:03:25] <kinblas> they run through 2 different code paths
[12:03:47] <kinblas> gseguin: what device does it seem slower on?
[12:03:49] <scottjehl> we could speed em up a little maybe
[12:04:05] <kinblas> scottjehl: we're already dropping frames on most android devices
[12:04:12] <scottjehl> ah k
[12:04:15] <kinblas> speeding them up would make it look like no animation on some devices
[12:14:07] <scottjehl> makes sense
[12:39:35] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddparker: gseguin: you guys have any issues we me landing the select refactor today?
[12:39:43] <_nickel> s/we/with/
[12:47:27] <scottjehl> I don't have time to review, but if you guys feel good about it, I'm fine with it!
[12:58:32] <_nickel> scottjehl: cool I'll probably land after I take care of some internal stuff
[12:58:47] <_nickel> I'll make sure to consult kinblas gseguin and toddparker
[13:24:14] <_nickel> kinblas: gseguin: toddparker: anyone have objects to landing the select decouple?
[13:24:28] <kinblas> nope
[13:50:17] <kinblas> scottjehl: I just reviewed your last scroll change
[13:50:26] <kinblas> I added a note to the checkin diffs
[13:50:27] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/f9b30d07bfbcd1019b9ad8bb692915b17bb6a976
[13:51:46] * kinblas strongly-dislikes issues with tons of comments like #455
[13:57:11] <_nickel> kinblas: caught a bug with my last bit of testing
[13:57:18] <_nickel> kinblas: added a test for it and the fix
[13:57:46] <kinblas> _nickel: is the recent code in your johnbender tree or the branch in jqm?
[13:57:49] <_nickel> kinblas: also one thing we don't do is highlight button state on extremely large custom select menus
[13:57:55] <_nickel> kinblas: my branch
[13:58:25] <_nickel> kinblas: the only thing I've done is to simplify the extension a tad
[13:58:26] <kinblas> "my branch" ... github/johnbender? github/jquery/jquery-mobile?
[13:58:34] <_nickel> the former
[13:58:43] <kinblas> ok your fork
[13:58:46] <_nickel> yessir
[13:58:59] <kinblas> I was looking at the branch on jquery-mobile today and didn't see any changes
[14:19:18] <_nickel> kinblas: gseguin: toddparker: commencing merge!
[14:19:55] <kinblas> great!
[14:20:50] * kinblas feels like a dork
[14:20:59] <kinblas> folks can't see my comments if I never "add a line note"
[14:22:43] <gseguin> sorry _nickel, yes go ahead
[14:25:29] <_nickel> kinblas: gseguin: toddparker: scottjehl: pushing after the whole test suite passes as green
[14:25:52] <gseguin> woohoo!
[14:26:03] <_nickel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/master
[14:26:16] <_nickel> I now own the leader board! RAWR! lol
[14:26:27] <_nickel> deleting the branch
[14:28:08] <kinblas> _nickel: so you need to share your rebasing workflow for that
[14:28:17] <_nickel> kinblas: haha
[14:28:18] <_nickel> well
[14:28:24] <_nickel> I cheated a bit
[14:28:37] <_nickel> I rebased early on and asked everyone to back off selects
[14:28:53] <_nickel> then just didn't push to the decoupled-select branch at origin
[14:29:01] <_nickel> because I didn't want to mess up other peoples history
[14:29:24] <_nickel> then when I merged I just preferred the changes from the branch because I basically replaced the select file completely
[14:29:31] <_nickel> and that was the only conflict
[14:29:38] * _nickel dusts off his hands
[14:29:43] <_nickel> ran the tests and pushed
[14:29:52] <kinblas> uh ok?
[14:29:54] <kinblas> :-)
[14:29:55] <_nickel> lol
[14:29:59] <_nickel> sorry bad explanation
[14:32:15] <_nickel> according to the impact graph I'm in a distant second to scott in terms of commits, additions, etc
[14:32:33] <kinblas> where is said graph/
[14:32:35] <kinblas> ??
[14:32:40] <_nickel> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/graphs/impact
[14:33:00] <_nickel> most of that is fairly artificial since I wrote so much of the test suite and that was really greenfield changes
[14:33:18] <_nickel> ie there wasn't anything there when I started and it was easy to add loc
[14:33:19] <kinblas> lol
[14:33:25] <kinblas> how in the world does anyone read that graph
[14:33:30] <kinblas> that jblas .. he's a slacker
[14:34:45] <rwaldron> hey dudes, i ahve a quick question about fixed header/footers
[14:34:54] <rwaldron> if anyone has a mnute
[14:42:22] <kinblas> rwaldron: shoot
[14:42:45] <kinblas> rwaldron: why does it suck?
[14:42:48] <kinblas> :-)
[14:50:49] <_nickel> alright
[14:50:54] <_nickel> I need to go dig up a tree
[14:50:59] <_nickel> I'll brb
[14:52:34] <gseguin> _nickel: literally? Good luck!
[15:00:38] <rwaldron> kinblas no no
[15:00:43] <rwaldron> i just needed some insight
[15:01:21] <rwaldron> on initial load of the app I'm working on, the footer seems to get stuck off screen
[15:01:50] <rwaldron> it comes back in view eventually
[15:16:21] <kinblas> rwaldron: is this with beta2?
[15:16:33] <rwaldron> hm. good question
[15:16:35] <rwaldron> let me check
[15:17:00] <kinblas> rwaldron: the reason I ask is because the way pages are initialized was changed by scottjehl when he decoupled the widgets
[15:17:35] <rwaldron> kinblas i'm rockin' latest on everything
[15:20:17] <kinblas> rwaldron: so when you say it comes back into view, is it after you touch the screen?
[15:20:37] <rwaldron> or click with mouse. yes
[15:25:04] <kinblas> rwaldron: I need to ask scott, but in the code he added for the decoupling
[15:25:13] <kinblas> he manually places the transition classes on the header/footer
[15:25:20] <kinblas> instead of calling show()
[15:25:24] <kinblas> like I think it used to
[15:25:46] <kinblas> the problem with placing the classes ... is that he's missing the "in" and "out" classes that actually trigger the animation
[15:26:01] <kinblas> also, without calling show, it won't calculate the correct positioning
[15:26:14] <kinblas> rwaldron: best thing is to file an issue and I'll fix t
[15:26:15] <kinblas> it
[15:26:28] <kinblas> go ahead and assign to jblas
[15:28:41] <rwaldron> kinblas i dont have permissions to assign anything
[15:28:43] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2259
[15:29:10] <kinblas> rwaldron: that's ok, I'll just grab it ... thanks for filing!!!
[15:29:18] <kinblas> github is my memory now-a-days
[15:29:19] <kinblas> :-)
[15:30:12] <rwaldron> i hear that
[15:30:18] <rwaldron> bugs.jquery.com is mine
[15:30:29] <kinblas> heh
[15:35:06] <toddparker> hey guys, heading home. i'll be back online mid/late morning tomorrow
[15:35:16] <toddparker> _nickel - looks like you landed select?
[15:35:45] <toddparker> alright, later!
[15:35:47] <gseguin> yup he did
[15:35:51] <gseguin> later toddmparker
[15:56:55] <kinblas> rwaldron: what browser/platform were you seeing that footer problem?
[15:57:35] <rwaldron> Part 1: http://gyazo.com/d71e3637391355b9ae06367183f14d80.png
[15:58:00] <rwaldron> Part 2: http://gyazo.com/cb592c11caa6d4ead7885b45d79b5d4d.png
[15:58:29] <rwaldron> Part 3: http://gyazo.com/5cdd5ba1e480b32fa2b39383baa00433.png
[15:58:37] <rwaldron> i can post those into the ticket
[15:59:26] <kinblas> rwaldron: I was looking into it further and the show is actually triggered via the pageshow event
[15:59:41] * rwaldron shrugs
[15:59:42] <kinblas> so when I tested it, on desktop at least, the headers/footers always show up
[15:59:53] <kinblas> that's why I was asking what platform/browser
[15:59:57] <rwaldron> chrome 13
[16:00:02] <rwaldron> osx
[16:00:04] <kinblas> windows? mac?
[16:00:07] <kinblas> ok let me try there
[16:00:07] <rwaldron> snow leopard
[16:00:13] <kinblas> i have the same setup
[16:00:20] <kinblas> but I tested on windows
[16:00:24] * kinblas switches to mac
[16:00:26] <rwaldron> i use window resizer to make it the size of a mobile device
[16:00:50] <kinblas> oh heh that's the other puzzle piece
[16:00:54] <kinblas> what dimensions?
[16:01:02] <kinblas> tablet? smartphone
[16:01:29] <rwaldron> did you see the screencaps?
[16:01:40] <rwaldron> 320x480
[16:01:43] <kinblas> heh not yet
[16:03:31] <kinblas> oh ok, that's another important thing
[16:03:39] <kinblas> your content doesn't fill up the height of the viewport
[16:04:43] <kinblas> rwaldron: is your footer a persistent one?
[16:07:53] <rwaldron> div data-role="footer" data-position="fixed" across the board
[16:16:14] <kinblas> rwaldron: hmmm, I can't repro on snow leopard with chrome 13
[16:16:27] <rwaldron> i dont know what to tell you bro
[16:16:40] <kinblas> is it possible for you to just copy and send me the markup for that page?
[16:16:43] <rwaldron> those screen caps show everything
[16:16:45] <kinblas> *before* the enhancement
[16:17:00] <rwaldron> sure, but i'm actually trying to get out of the office right now
[16:17:07] <kinblas> no rush
[16:17:16] <rwaldron> touch base with you tomorrow
[16:17:17] <kinblas> I'll just create a listview page for now and see if I can re-pro
[17:13:31] <gseguin> kinblas: _nickel do you guys think triggering an event onfilter on a listview is a good idea?
[17:14:27] <gseguin> these setTimeouts in the unit tests are bothering me
[17:14:33] <_nickel> gseguin: I think we have to carefully consider the events and api we expose otherwise we might get stuck supporting something that hurs us
[17:14:36] <_nickel> *hurts us
[17:14:57] <_nickel> also I don't think events are always the best way to provide for functional alterations
[17:15:14] <_nickel> because it leads to monkey patching/method chaining which can cause support nightmares
[17:15:20] * _nickel is waving his hands
[17:15:41] <_nickel> whats the use case
[17:15:50] <gseguin> well here it's more to know when the filtering has happened really
[17:15:52] <_nickel> I'm predicting Kin's response here :D
[17:16:05] <_nickel> whats the purpose there?
[17:16:18] <gseguin> in the listview tests there are setTimeouts
[17:16:48] <_nickel> ah!
[17:16:57] <gseguin> and knowing when the filtering has happened would help us remove these
[17:17:00] <_nickel> so we have this problem all over
[17:17:07] <_nickel> including in the small custom select menus
[17:17:08] <gseguin> in the real world, don't know
[17:17:20] <_nickel> hmm
[17:17:27] <_nickel> I suppose you could have "private" events
[17:17:35] <_nickel> in the same way we have "private" widget methods
[17:17:47] * _nickel doesn't like prefixing things with "underscore"
[17:18:26] * gseguin loves the underscore, the best privacy provider!
[17:19:14] <gseguin> I'll bring it up in the meeting tomorrow
[17:19:50] <_nickel> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2230
[17:19:52] <_nickel> new feature?
[17:20:15] <gseguin> dojo has dojo.connect
[17:20:41] <_nickel> gseguin: gewgling
[17:20:52] <gseguin> for our test we need that
[17:21:14] <_nickel> gseguin: thats a good example of a non event api
[17:22:36] <_nickel> gseguin: I need to do more reading on dojo
[17:22:48] <_nickel> I've used MooTools classes before (since their class system is very similar to Ruby)
[17:22:56] <gseguin> don't, you're going to like it too much
[17:22:59] <gseguin> :)
[17:23:00] * _nickel needs to expand his horizons
[17:23:16] <_nickel> stealing good ideas is fun
[17:37:03] <_nickel> gseguin: kinblas: do you guys know what the functional tests are?
[17:37:32] <kinblas> they test functionality?
[17:37:34] <kinblas> :-)
[17:37:35] <gseguin> no idea, I was wondering the same thing
[17:37:47] <gseguin> lol
[17:37:55] <_nickel> gseguin: the pull request at the bottom of the stack is to update them
[17:38:01] <kinblas> oh
[17:38:09] <_nickel> gseguin: we need to remove stuff that we aren't going to support
[17:38:11] <kinblas> I think those were part of the docs at one point
[17:38:12] <_nickel> this is getting silly
[17:38:14] <gseguin> oh yeah that's why I looked at them and wondered
[17:38:16] <kinblas> to show for example the tests things
[17:38:39] <_nickel> I'm going to pull those out into a branch
[17:39:01] <_nickel> that should reduce visibility
[17:39:19] <gseguin> good idea
[17:39:29] <_nickel> actually what about the speed tests too?
[17:40:25] <gseguin> what are these testing?
[17:40:46] <_nickel> gseguin: not sure
[17:44:42] <_nickel> maybe I'll just ask tomorrow
[17:45:29] <_nickel> I'm just going to merge these changes because it clearly doesn't matter and it will only make this guy happy
[17:46:12] <_nickel> we can move them out tomorrow after we chat
[17:46:17] <kinblas> _nickel: wasn't the default for selects in beta2 native and not custom?
[17:46:33] <_nickel> kinblas: indeed
[17:46:36] <_nickel> it should still be
[17:46:46] <_nickel> unless that branch that I started with what hyper old
[17:46:54] <_nickel> in which case I made an unfortunate assumption
[17:47:05] <_nickel> kinblas: why do you ask?
[17:47:06] <kinblas> oh nevermind ... I'm looking at a test case ... the guy is setting the default to custom in a mobileinit handler
[17:47:13] <kinblas> carry on :-)
[17:47:31] <kinblas> I'm looking at one of those ghost click blocker bugs
[17:47:43] <_nickel> kinblas: ah!
[17:48:01] * _nickel carries on
[23:11:36] <gseguin> _nickel: kinblas: ping
[23:11:44] <_nickel> gseguin: heyo
[23:11:50] <gseguin> hey!
[23:11:56] <gseguin> another late night?
[23:12:02] * _nickel shrugs
[23:12:03] <_nickel> normal
[23:12:14] <_nickel> 10 - 1 _was_ when I worked on jqm
[23:12:21] <_nickel> now its when I futz
[23:12:27] * _nickel is working on his emacs config
[23:12:34] <gseguin> :)
[23:12:37] <gseguin> hey I was wondering if you could make sense of: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.listview.js#L164
[23:12:58] <gseguin> and hey I was wondering if you could make sense of: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.listview.js#L179
[23:13:03] <_nickel> wow
[23:13:15] <gseguin> sorry extra copy/paste
[23:13:24] <gseguin> links changed though
[23:13:24] <_nickel> staircase to hell o.O
[23:13:37] <gseguin> :)
[23:14:43] <_nickel> its getting the sibling after next :(
[23:14:48] <_nickel> and checking if it exists
[23:15:08] <gseguin> yeah and removing the corners if it doesn't
[23:15:10] <_nickel> ie length of 0 is falsy
[23:15:25] <_nickel> in the first one it adds corners
[23:15:39] <gseguin> let me push my stuff to a branch in my repo
[23:15:39] <_nickel> err  nevermind
[23:16:06] <_nickel> this is really hard to follow :(
[23:16:21] <_nickel> its really short though
[23:16:28] <_nickel> this looks like a prime target for a refactor
[23:19:09] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2262
[23:19:37] <gseguin> _nickel:  ^^^
[23:21:00] <gseguin> I've also refactored some of the tests so don't worry about the test changes
[23:21:32] <_nickel> gseguin: your test scares me :D but the refactor looks like an improvement
[23:21:51] <gseguin> what's up with the test?
[23:22:33] <_nickel> the nested timeouts are hard to follow
[23:22:50] <gseguin> oh
[23:22:57] <gseguin> ok, I can fix that
[23:23:12] <_nickel> in that case I'd just live with using a timeout on the first page load and use sequence
[23:23:14] <gseguin> I mean, I can split it into more tests
[23:24:10] <gseguin> here we're just waiting for the redraw to happen
[23:25:19] <gseguin> I can split the test in 4 tests if you think it'll make it more readable
[23:25:54] <gseguin> maybe I should comment though
[23:26:05] <_nickel> gseguin: https://gist.github.com/8ffb6456816264084a2a
[23:26:31] <_nickel> or if you have your heart set on using pagesequence for that first load
[23:26:41] <gseguin> doesn't .sequence listen to "pageshow" ?
[23:27:13] <gseguin> to execute the functions in the array?
[23:27:55] <gseguin> _nickel: sorry, not pageshow, "changepage"
[23:28:09] <gseguin> yeah that's not going to work
[23:28:16] <gseguin> I'm not changing page here
[23:28:31] <_nickel> ?
[23:28:36] <_nickel> sequence is just timed
[23:28:44] <_nickel> pageSequence listens for an event
[23:28:57] <_nickel> eventSequence just listens for whatever you like :D
[23:29:06] <_nickel> gseguin: https://gist.github.com/8ffb6456816264084a2a
[23:29:07] * gseguin feels really stupid now
[23:29:13] <gseguin> I can't read, sorry
[23:29:21] <_nickel> the function is poorly named
[23:29:26] <_nickel> it should be timedSequence by rights
[23:29:32] <gseguin> I read pageSequence
[23:29:32] <_nickel> so its not your fault
[23:29:44] <_nickel> ahh
[23:29:53] <_nickel> the second one is probably the "best"
[23:29:56] <_nickel> but seems unecessary
[23:30:18] <_nickel> then you can trim the timeout to the 50 ms you had earlier
[23:30:26] * _nickel is nitpicking
[23:30:53] <_nickel> gseguin: I'm still trying to grok your chain-fu in the actual meat of the commit
[23:31:35] * gseguin modifies the tests
[23:33:51] * gseguin runs the tests
[23:35:53] <gseguin> _nickel: just pushed
[23:36:03] <gseguin> to my branch
[23:36:14] <gseguin> thanks for the pointer to .sequence
[23:37:41] <_nickel> np np
[23:37:49] <_nickel> sadly I'm most accute when helping with tests
[23:38:00] <_nickel> note that I'm not being very helpful with your actual problem
[23:38:43] <gseguin> well the tests pass, so that's a good sign that I didn't fuck things up
[23:42:00] <gseguin> _nickel: I'm going to leave it like that, review it if you have time and unless I get a "DON'T DO IT!", I'll land it tomorrow morning
[23:42:09] <_nickel> cool
[23:42:20] <gseguin> thank you!
[23:42:41] <gseguin> 'night
