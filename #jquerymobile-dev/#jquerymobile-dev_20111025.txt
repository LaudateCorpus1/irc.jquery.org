[08:06:07] <toddparker>  morning all
[08:11:56] <toddparker> kinblas - we really need to make a phone gap docs page
[08:11:57] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2828
[08:11:58] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2828 on jquery-mobile, reported by groovq (9h, 24m ago): Origin file:// is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin - but not in IE
[08:12:19] <toddparker> i remember this being discussed, but all the mumbo jumbo should be in a page
[09:03:29] <aaronmcadam> toddmparker_: clarification over events would help there, have seen people writing wrappers that synchronise phonegap's device.ready and jqm's events
[09:03:36] <aaronmcadam> toddmparker : clarification over events would help there, have seen people writing wrappers that synchronise phonegap's device.ready and jqm's events
[09:03:41] <aaronmcadam> dammit haha
[09:03:51] <aaronmcadam> toddparker : clarification over events would help there, have seen people writing wrappers that synchronise phonegap's device.ready and jqm's events
[09:04:59] <aaronmcadam> and most others plain confused
[09:07:09] <toddparker> yeah
[09:07:43] <toddparker> i think there are some basic thing that are different with phonegap that would due nice to summarize, sort of like the "scripting pages" doc page
[09:08:01] <toddparker> can be minor, but just to get people looking at the right stuff
[09:29:56] <toddparker> kinblas: you around?
[09:36:55] <kinblas> toddparker: yup
[09:43:29] <toddparker> hey kin
[09:43:36] <kinblas> yo
[09:43:45] <toddparker> is this a bug?
[09:43:46] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2833
[09:43:47] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2833 on jquery-mobile, reported by offsky (1h, 2m ago): changePage will not update hash if passed an object
[09:44:15] <kinblas> my suspicion is that he is injecting content and that content doesn't have a data-url on it
[09:44:24] <toddparker> hmm
[09:44:27] <toddparker> could be
[09:44:34] <kinblas> I asked him in the bug for more info
[09:44:42] <toddparker> oh, ok!
[09:44:45] <toddparker> just saw that
[09:44:50] <toddparker> be back in a  few
[09:44:59] <kinblas> toddparker: we could be a bit friendly and just add a data-url if there isn't one and the page has an id on it
[09:45:02] <toddparker> we can reconnect on the event stuff?
[09:45:13] <toddparker> that's true
[09:45:27] <toddparker> might prevent some issues
[09:45:32] <kinblas> toddparker: so I got my hands on an iPhone 4 that was running 4.2 yesterday, and is now upgraded to iOS5
[09:45:37] <kinblas> man is iOS5 sluggish
[09:45:37] <toddparker> cool
[09:45:40] <toddparker> yeah
[09:45:50] <toddparker> new OS, old hardware = slow
[09:45:51] <kinblas> things that were fast yesterday are a bit more sluggish today
[09:45:58] <toddparker> good you can see what i see
[09:46:19] <kinblas> so anyways, I can see the slow down I saw in iOS4
[09:46:37] <kinblas> but the initial scrolling sluggishness kind of takes away from that
[09:46:38] <toddparker> good
[09:46:44] <kinblas> so you don't see/appreciate it :-)
[09:46:50] <toddparker> easier if we both have comparable testing
[09:47:00] <kinblas> so yeah this sucks for us
[09:47:06] <toddparker> i have no idea what that is
[09:47:08] <kinblas> btw, I took jQtouch
[09:47:11] <toddparker> that is really bad
[09:47:18] <kinblas> and added 400 items to their main demo page
[09:47:22] <toddparker> and...
[09:47:30] <kinblas> they are sluggish too, and rendering is particularly annoying
[09:47:34] <toddparker> yeah?
[09:47:35] <kinblas> because they translate3d all their pages
[09:47:43] <kinblas> so you get these tearing/block updates
[09:47:50] <toddparker> really? heavy.
[09:48:04] <kinblas> I just needed another comparison point ... since folks are always saying they are faster
[09:48:16] <kinblas> they also have the sluggishness because they register a touchstart handler on body
[09:48:37] <kinblas> so in terms of scrolling perf, I think we're on par with them
[09:48:42] <kinblas> it's just perception
[09:48:49] <toddparker> interesting
[09:48:58] <kinblas> you should give it a try ;-)
[09:49:07] <toddparker> but jqtouch is on the way out
[09:49:14] <kinblas> ??
[09:49:19] <toddparker> it's the sencha/native comparisons
[09:49:20] <kinblas> Stark isn't going to maintain?
[09:49:27] <toddparker> oh, i dunno
[09:49:50] <toddparker> just saying it sort of on life support
[09:49:55] <johnbender> kinblas: toddparker: not sure if you guys have been following this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1335#issuecomment-2513071
[09:49:56] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1335 on jquery-mobile, reported by anttears (6m, 3w ago): Label clicks not firing event on associated radio buttons
[09:50:11] <toddparker> i have johnbender
[09:50:16] <kinblas> ok, I'm just sayin, I've seen lots of folks sayin' I'm going back to jQTouch cause perf is better there
[09:50:25] <toddparker> yeah? interesting
[09:50:25] <kinblas> and when I ask, they always mention list scrolling
[09:50:34] <toddparker> i think this is something we need to improve
[09:50:40] <toddparker> some way or another
[09:50:57] <kinblas> yeah, but I don't think that improvement is going to happen in any stable way between now and Nov 4th
[09:50:57] <toddparker> i'd agree it's unacceptable for lists over 50 items
[09:51:00] <kinblas> is alls I'm sayin'
[09:51:37] <toddparker> so what needs to happen to get this to be smooth, regardless of time
[09:52:19] <johnbender> toddparker: kinblas: gseguin: The only thing I have to sort out is a way to test the functionality since it appears impossible to trigger a click on an input's label and have the click event propagate to the input itself
[09:52:33] <johnbender> but a click that's actually fired by the browser works just fine
[09:52:45] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah, triggered clicks don't cause the default action of an element to happen
[09:52:54] <toddparker> johnbender: tricky because in iOS clicking the label doesn't seem to make the radio/check toggle
[09:52:58] <toddparker> like every other browser
[09:53:04] <johnbender> toddparker: wtf
[09:53:07] <johnbender> seriously?
[09:53:10] <kinblas> johnbender: I forgot to mention to you that I think there is a triggerHandler
[09:53:20] <toddparker> surprising. i was playing with the data-role=none demo page and the label does nothing.
[09:53:21] <johnbender> kinblas: yes!
[09:53:24] <kinblas> call where you can trigger the click handler for an element without generating an event
[09:53:32] <johnbender> thank you
[09:53:41] <johnbender> I was going to go searching for that
[09:53:47] <johnbender> toddparker: you have to be kidding me
[09:53:54] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/forms-all-native.html
[09:53:58] <toddparker> try that on iOS
[09:54:28] <toddparker> unless we're breaking this somehow
[09:54:46] <kinblas> toddparker: regarding the performance thing ... there are a couple of things to experiment with ... one is trying to get rid of listening for touch events on the document or body since they cause that terrible slow down.
[09:55:18] <toddparker> i'm on board with that kinblas
[09:55:37] <toddparker> but what does that affect? everything?
[09:55:40] <kinblas> toddparker: the other is to try and tackle percieved performance
[09:56:04] <toddparker> hmm, ideas on that? tricks?
[09:56:30] <kinblas> toddparker: one thing that gives a sluggish feel for example is the scroll to last offset after a transition
[09:56:43] <kinblas> it causes the browser to repaint after the transition
[09:56:49] <eddiemonge> on that scrolling, one thing i was noticing was that it was trying to highlight everything as it was scrolling
[09:56:52] <toddparker> to hide the url bar
[09:56:59] <kinblas> because we're going to an area of the document that hasn't rendered in the viewport yet
[09:57:07] <eddiemonge> i dont know if it was trying to highlight everything i used to grab the page or something else
[09:57:20] <toddparker> that's odd
[09:57:23] <kinblas> toddparker: oh yeah eddie just reminded me of something
[09:57:28] <toddparker> how could you tell it was selecting
[09:57:31] <kinblas> there's no way to tell when a scroll is finished
[09:57:40] <kinblas> that is something we should lobby for
[09:57:42] <eddiemonge> it was turning grey
[09:57:45] <kinblas> from the browsers
[09:57:50] <toddparker> scollend
[09:58:04] <toddparker> we should seriously create a wiki page
[09:58:11] <toddparker> i've been talking to msft today
[09:58:13] <kinblas> toddparker: so we can tell we're in the midst of a scroll and not do all that work we're doing
[09:58:16] <toddparker> we have good contacts there now
[09:58:27] <toddparker> ah
[09:58:30] <kinblas> these are issues we didn't have to contend with on the desktop
[09:58:43] <kinblas> since the scrolling was managed *OUTSIDE* the canvas/viewport
[09:58:44] <toddparker> so we can't say "no nothing" on scrollstart
[09:59:10] <toddparker> meaning on desktop, the whole page is rendered completely
[09:59:38] <kinblas> toddparker: no meaning you don't get mouse events in the document when clicking on the scrollbars
[09:59:48] <toddparker> right
[10:00:00] <toddparker> but on mobile, the document is the scrollbar
[10:00:02] <kinblas> but that is an issue *NOW* in the mobile landscape
[10:00:07] <kinblas> right
[10:00:35] <toddparker> ok, so what are some near-term tweaks we can make
[10:00:51] <toddparker> every bit helps
[10:01:02] <kinblas> for scrolling? Or percieved performance?
[10:01:13] <toddparker> either
[10:01:21] <kinblas> for one thing, I think we need a way to shut off the restore scroll position after a transition
[10:01:40] <toddparker> we have that threshold already
[10:01:50] <toddparker> if it's set to a high value, it won't restire
[10:01:54] <toddparker> but isn't that bad?
[10:02:08] <toddparker> we need to remember that
[10:02:27] <toddparker> one things that bugs me is dialogs take like 2-3 seconds to close
[10:02:30] <kinblas> it's configurable, let the developers make the trade-offs
[10:02:44] <toddparker> sure, but we have the option for that
[10:02:46] <kinblas> toddparker: that we should look at if you have a test case
[10:02:59] <kinblas> part of this is that we are reloading and reparsing the DOM again
[10:03:19] <kinblas> the pruning has definitely added some percieved sluggishness
[10:03:28] <toddparker> post-1.0, we should think about keeping the parent of a dialog in history because there is a good chance you may need it again
[10:03:31] <kinblas> since we are loading pages every time
[10:03:38] <toddparker> or not cull a page until it 2 steps back
[10:03:48] <kinblas> right
[10:03:56] <toddparker> but that's maybe another conversation for later
[10:03:57] <kinblas> so that was the other thing
[10:04:08] <kinblas> perhaps being able to say keep 5 pages in the DOM
[10:04:10] <kinblas> or whatever
[10:04:16] <toddparker> buffer size
[10:04:18] <toddparker> yeah
[10:04:20] <johnbender> toddparker: my testing in ios shows that it does fire the click handler
[10:04:23] <johnbender> thank GOD
[10:04:34] <toddparker> the rule now is simple and clean for use, but maybe not optimal
[10:05:42] <kinblas> toddparker: the other thing that I think adds to sluggishness
[10:05:46] <kinblas> is how we enhance the document
[10:06:07] <kinblas> toddparker: before the decoupling ... we searched the doc for data-role elements and inputs
[10:06:21] <kinblas> the code then filtered that list to extract the elements they were interested in
[10:06:30] <eddiemonge> im out for the day. ping me on skype if im needed
[10:06:39] <kinblas> this list filtering is *MUCH* smaller than having each component searching the entire page themselves
[10:07:07] <toddparker> do decoupling added some overhead for enhancement
[10:07:11] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm curious how much the page contraint on the selectors helps
[10:07:12] <kinblas> so as the pages get bigger, the noticeably slower the page enhancement is
[10:07:14] <johnbender> if at all
[10:07:26] <kinblas> johnbender: what do you mean?
[10:07:49] <kinblas> johnbender: oh you mean now that we prune other pages?
[10:08:02] <kinblas> johnbender: constraining the search is still good IMO
[10:08:07] <johnbender> kinblas: no we scope the selectors for each of the widgets to the page
[10:08:10] <toddparker> onlylook within page ID of "foo"
[10:08:22] <kinblas> johnbender: we do that already
[10:08:34] <kinblas> they use the page being enhanced as the scope
[10:08:44] <kinblas> but the fact is now all the components are traversing that entire subtree
[10:08:52] <toddparker> ok so that's as tight as it can be
[10:08:57] <kinblas> versus someone doing that *ONCE* and everyone filtering the results
[10:09:08] <kinblas> which is how it used to be
[10:09:21] <toddparker> so each plugin needs to parse the DOM
[10:09:22] <kinblas> toddparker: in that 400 item listview page
[10:09:30] <kinblas> every component is traversing that entire hierarchy
[10:09:41] <toddparker> instead of page parsing the DOM once and triggering the widdgets
[10:09:49] <toddparker> sheesh
[10:10:11] <toddparker> can you think of better ways to handle that?
[10:10:53] <toddparker> to be clear: you're saying that every plugin we have that looks for data-role or other init trigger, is each searching the DOM
[10:11:06] <kinblas> toddparker: one thing we can do in the near-term is have a jquery.mobile.role.js plugin
[10:11:15] <johnbender> toddparker: search the dom children of a page element
[10:11:35] <kinblas> for now it can be simple, all it does is augment the pagecreate notification/event with this list
[10:11:43] <toddparker> sure johnbender, not the whole ODM, but the nodes of the active page
[10:11:46] <johnbender> unless I misunderstand how $("myselector", element) works
[10:12:05] <toddparker> kinblas: i think that would be a great idea
[10:12:36] <toddparker> so it doesn't really mess with decoupling, it just provides a quick lookup shortcut for plugins to say "am I needed?"
[10:12:46] <kinblas> yeah
[10:12:49] <toddparker> like it
[10:13:12] <toddparker> can you create a ticket for that and capture what it will do?
[10:13:18] <kinblas> sure
[10:13:22] <toddparker> set it for the 1.0 milestone
[10:13:30] <kinblas> let me finish up a test case for 2830
[10:13:34] <toddparker> ok
[10:13:56] <johnbender> toddparker: so my testing in ios shows that the click handler is indeed fired which is what we need
[10:14:02] <toddparker> the android key press issue?
[10:14:05] <johnbender> and the property does indeed change
[10:14:29] <toddparker> good news johnbender
[10:14:53] <toddparker> i was just saying that in iOS, clicking the label doesn't do anything to the input it's associated with
[10:15:06] <toddparker> every other browser uses the label as a proxy for the input
[10:15:15] <johnbender> it appears to work ok here
[10:15:16] <toddparker> which makes radios and checks hard to use in iOS
[10:15:20] <toddparker> really?
[10:15:41] <johnbender> yah when we enhance and I bind a click handler to the input it fires just fine
[10:18:30] <johnbender> toddparker: so in the native forms page you link
[10:18:43] <johnbender> the checkboxes for font styling work fine
[10:19:17] <toddparker> you can tap the label?
[10:19:23] <toddparker> and the check, checks
[10:20:01] <toddparker> i'm not seeing that in my testing
[10:20:21] <johnbender> toddparker: yes but the snacks don't work
[10:20:25] <toddparker> BTW - if you google "checkbox html" the first 10+ Google results will show you examples that don't use labels
[10:20:30] <toddparker> gross
[10:20:42] <Wilto> W3SCHOOLS 4 LYFE
[10:20:46] <johnbender> lol
[10:20:51] <toddparker> <input type="radio" name="sex" value="male" /> Male<br />
[10:20:55] <Wilto> Made me what I am today.
[10:20:58] <toddparker> http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
[10:21:11] <toddparker> anywayz
[10:21:30] <toddparker> be back in a few guys
[10:21:53] <johnbender> toddparker: let me know when you get back
[10:22:01] <toddparker> will do
[10:34:59] <johnbender> kinblas: triggerHandler has solved all my problems with a line change me thinks
[10:35:20] <johnbender> though I do sort of like the idea of letting the browser handle that interaction
[10:39:12] <toddparker> ok, i'm back
[10:41:09] <Wilto> Likewise.
[10:42:07] <toddparker> i just looped you guys in on the conversation with msft
[10:42:13] <toddparker> would friday work for a call witht hem?
[10:42:33] <toddparker> so kinblas - back to our perf conversation
[10:42:43] <toddparker> now that you replied to that issue
[10:43:14] <toddparker> i think the role.js will be a huge help
[10:43:21] <toddparker> might make underpowered devices much faster
[10:43:49] <toddparker> but what other ideas can we explore
[10:44:13] <toddparker> can we remove some of the event stuff to smooth this out
[10:47:05] <toddparker> johnbender: need anything from me?
[10:47:29] <johnbender> toddparker: I just tried out triggerHandler at kin's suggestion and it works fine
[10:47:41] <johnbender> because it avoids our vclick handler by not bubbling
[10:47:46] <johnbender> I would prefer to let the browser do it's job
[10:47:54] <johnbender> but that change was fairly drastic
[10:48:00] <johnbender> this is a one liner
[10:48:08] <johnbender> and solves the problem so we don't need to fret
[10:48:26] <toddparker> great news

[11:26:58] <kinblas> toddparker: sorry, I'm back
[11:27:11] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'd prefer to avoid churn like that for the sake of adding semi colons
[11:27:14] * kinblas tries to reorient himself with where he was at
[11:27:29] <johnbender> unless there's a standard we should be adhereing to for jquery
[11:27:40] <johnbender> err colons
[11:27:47] <eddiemonge> johnbender: i know the TODO: is a "standard" in some code editors
[11:28:46] * johnbender shrugs
[11:28:54] <eddiemonge> since its stripped out in the min versions anyway, i think its a harmless change and will make the requester feel like he contributed
[11:29:01] <eddiemonge> plus i like consistency ;)
[11:29:08] <eddiemonge> hence my pull req
[11:29:10] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'd prefer he contribute meaningfully :/
[11:29:44] <eddiemonge> what if that lead to someone looking through all the todos in their editor and actually doing them????
[11:29:49] <eddiemonge> in an ideal world

[11:32:11] <eddiemonge> ok ok, it was just a suggestion.

[11:40:01] <eddiemonge> like this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2840
[11:40:01] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (23m, 34s ago): Standardize licenses in files and match jQuery core min license in min fi
[11:40:06] <eddiemonge> ?
[11:40:43] <johnbender> eddiemonge: :D
[11:40:46] <johnbender> indeed
[11:41:05] <eddiemonge> i thought we should match core
[11:41:21] <johnbender> i'm going to send an email to everyone to give them the heads up on this
[11:41:22] <eddiemonge> plus all those differences make it harder to sed
[11:41:41] <eddiemonge> im just not sure about the CSS one though. we might want more info in that one
[11:42:21] <eddiemonge> or not. im not sure how it interacts with TR
[11:45:54] <eddiemonge> copy and pasted. you should go through all the prs and paste that
[12:31:30] <toddparker> sorry guys i'm back
[12:31:53] <toddparker> eddiemonge: if you have time to look at some pulls or bugs, that would be awesome.
[12:35:12] <toddparker> agree that while consistency is great, whitespace and formatting is less critical and there is always a chance something will break with these
[12:38:24] <eddiemonge> toddparker: ive been looking at some and commenting where i felt appropriate
[12:51:23] <toddparker> great eddiemonge
[12:57:29] <johnbender> toddparker: cool I just thought we should all be on the same page so we don't mis represent to different folks
[13:34:08] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2835
[13:34:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2835 on jquery-mobile, reported by offsky (3h, 42m ago): pagechangefailed not triggered when changing to non-existent internal page
[13:34:14] <johnbender> do you want me to take a look at that
[13:34:14] <johnbender> ?
[13:37:38] <johnbender> kinblas: that was our discussion with throwing errors instead of defaulting to the home page.
[13:38:39] <toddparker> johnbender: i think kinblas  is working on #2845
[13:39:25] <johnbender> toddparker: kk
[13:39:32] <johnbender> we've had discussions about that very thign
[13:39:34] <johnbender> *thing
[13:39:51] <toddparker> wait, think he said #2835
[13:39:58] <johnbender> yah thats the right number
[13:40:22] <toddparker> the "if no id exists, duplicate is created" isssue
[13:40:46] <johnbender> toddparker: I left my visual studio files and I was going to try and isntall it on a bootcamp partition so I can have a singel windows/mac machine
[13:40:57] <johnbender> toddparker: no it defaults to pulling the home page
[13:41:03] <johnbender> it should raise an error
[13:41:03] <toddparker> right
[13:41:05] <johnbender> the guy is right
[13:41:12] <toddparker> yep
[13:41:21] <johnbender> FAIL HARD AND LOUD!
[13:41:23] <johnbender> :D
[13:41:49] <Wilto> Story of my life.
[13:42:29] <johnbender> toddparker: hopefully he'll respond
[13:47:04] <toddparker> yeah
[14:08:59] <kinblas> toddparker: johnbender: so for 2835 should we be throwing the load failed dialog for an embedded page?
[14:09:08] <kinblas> I have it error'ing out and not duplicating content
[14:09:18] <kinblas> but was curious what the expectation is in terms of feedback
[14:09:36] <kinblas> by error'ing out I meant, it currently throws a pagechangefailed
[14:10:05] <kinblas> but it doesn't go through the ajax loading path where that load failed dialog gets thrown so I'm wondering if folks are expecting to see that load failed error for embedded page case
[14:14:22] <johnbender> kinblas: that's worth it's commit
[14:14:28] <johnbender> *it's own commit
[14:14:48] <johnbender> I kind of think it should
[14:15:09] <johnbender> but I'm warry of making that assumption right now
[14:15:25] <kinblas> ok I'll check in what I have now, after I finish the unit test
[14:15:28] <johnbender> we might end up with people getting more error dialogs than they were used to
[14:16:03] <johnbender> which raises a more interesting question that I've always had
[14:16:17] * kinblas listens
[14:16:22] <johnbender> kinblas: toddparker: gseguin: how do you provide deprecation feedback for javascript libraries
[14:16:33] <johnbender> console.log?
[14:16:46] <johnbender> I've never seen anyone do that
[14:16:49] <kinblas> ew
[14:16:50] <kinblas> :-)
[14:16:58] <kinblas> documentation
[14:17:15] <johnbender> right, and everyone does that
[14:17:18] <kinblas> ... perhaps an annoying alert
[14:17:20] <kinblas> :-)
[14:17:21] <johnbender> lol
[14:17:31] <johnbender> or an error message?
[14:17:42] <kinblas> "didn't you read the docs? You shouldn't be calling this."
[14:17:56] <johnbender> right
[14:19:00] <kinblas> toddparker: johnbender: danheberden: where did we leave off with the Theme Roller dealio?
[14:19:04] <johnbender> you have to rely on the docs on some level
[14:19:22] <danheberden> kinblas we decided that theme roller was a bit much, and we're just going to give people one theme to ouse
[14:19:31] <kinblas> lol
[14:20:05] <kinblas> I'm thinking let's do what's easy, so we can start getting feedback ... if folks are screamin' for a formal config we can always add that
[14:20:39] <kinblas> right now the important thing is just hiding the key so folks don't start using it from their sites :-)
[14:20:57] <kinblas> Tyler should be online tomorrow morning
[14:21:11] <kinblas> he was just pinging me earlier asking what we decided
[14:21:54] <kinblas> johnbender: btw, appologies if it sounded like I was coming off against a config ... I was just asking for clarification. I'm not against any sort of external config
[14:22:14] <kinblas> I want to make it easy for folks to use/deploy
[14:22:26] <kinblas> and yeah I agree reaching into PHP is not ideal
[14:22:27] <Wilto> danheberden++
[14:26:00] <toddparker> +1 on  sigle theme
[14:26:05] <toddparker> swanky purse from UI
[14:26:38] <toddparker> so are we all set on the plan for TR?
[14:26:48] <toddparker> does Tyler just need to make the change tomorrow?
[14:27:00] <toddparker> sorry, confused on where we landed
[14:27:10] <toddparker> eddiemonge: you see this:
[14:27:10] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2843
[14:27:12] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2843 on jquery-mobile, reported by plievone (6m, 13s ago): Commit @b0db897 uses array.indexOf() which breaks IE8
[14:27:28] <toddparker> regression
[14:27:57] <toddparker> tagged to you if you can take a look
[14:28:07] <johnbender> kinblas: not at all
[14:29:06] * kinblas responded in the wrong IRC window
[14:29:07] <kinblas> member:toddparker: everything is in github, the only thing necessary to just get it going is to define the variable
[14:29:22] <toddparker> yeah, ok
[14:29:27] <kinblas> toddparker: I think Dan has to do that
[14:29:32] <toddparker> and is that something tyler can do or does he need dan's help?
[14:29:38] <kinblas> Tyler said he updated the source on the server today
[14:29:43] <toddparker> you answered my Q before i wrote it
[14:29:45] <kinblas> with dan's control.jquerymobile.com thingie
[14:30:05] <toddparker> ok so is this ready for danheberden  to look at then?
[14:31:29] <Wilto> Someone in here said they did a bisect to find the commit that was causing the Android select menu issue, yeah? Show of hands.
[14:32:23] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah if Dan could just create a .htaccess with the key we'll be good
[14:32:42] <Wilto> Scratch that; found it.
[14:34:45] <johnbender> jzaefferer: did you see my email about the ci setup?
[14:34:56] <johnbender> wondering if that was useful at all or lacked enough information
[14:35:42] <jzaefferer> johnbender: yeah, dunno why I didn't reply - tis very useful!
[14:36:04] <johnbender> jzaefferer: good, please don't hesitate if you have questions though it's simple
[14:36:08] <johnbender> which is why I like it :D
[14:36:12] <kinblas> eddiemonge: related to 2843 the extra thing that hasClass() does for us is make sure that the class name exactly matches ... your changes will match anything beginning with the specified strings.
[14:40:02] <johnbender> toddparker: will you help me remember to ask them about contacting the asp.net mvc team however huge their company may be?
[14:40:09] <johnbender> the attribute namespacing is important
[14:40:14] <johnbender> data attributes that is
[14:41:11] <toddparker> good point john
[14:41:18] <toddparker> are you going to be on the call
[14:41:22] <toddparker> on friday
[14:41:22] <johnbender> toddparker: yah I
[14:41:27] <toddparker> kewl
[14:41:32] <johnbender> I'm sorry I didn't respond earlier, honestly I thought that I had
[14:41:42] <johnbender> I wanted to be on it so much I assumed I would have already responded
[14:41:44] <johnbender> or some such
[14:41:47] * johnbender is crazytown
[14:50:51] <eddiemonge> kinblas: yeah youre right
[14:54:48] <eddiemonge> kinblas: actually i just tried a test and indexOf only finds the exact matches
[14:55:32] <eddiemonge> oops nevermind
[14:57:01] <eddiemonge> ?eval var s = "ui-btn-disabled hello", sp = s.split(' '); sp.indexOf( "ui-btn" )
[14:57:02] <bot-t> eddiemonge: -1
[14:57:08] <eddiemonge> ?eval var s = "ui-btn-disabled hello", sp = s.split(' '); sp.indexOf( "ui-btn-disabled" )
[14:57:09] <bot-t> eddiemonge: 0
[14:57:20] <eddiemonge> kinblas: ^^
[14:58:52] <kinblas> eddiemonge: the array version of indexOf does exact match, the string version doesn't
[14:59:06] <kinblas> I believe jQuery core uses the array version
[14:59:33] <kinblas> if you're going to be doing that split().indexOf() business, you might as well just call hasClass()?
[14:59:35] <aaronmcadam> inArray uses Array.indexOf where native is available
[15:00:02] <aaronmcadam> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.inArray
[15:00:21] <eddiemonge> yeah i was thinking inArray would be better. i was literally looking at that right now
[15:00:32] <aaronmcadam> cool :)
[15:00:37] <eddiemonge> hasClass is pretty excessive and slow
[15:01:26] <kinblas> eddiemonge: I just checked core hasClass() is doing a string indexOf
[15:01:31] <aaronmcadam> yeah it loops thru the set and runs match() and indexOf
[15:02:52] <aaronmcadam> the source viewer is awesome :D
[15:03:08] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: which source viewer?
[15:03:13] <aaronmcadam> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.inArray
[15:03:15] <aaronmcadam> this one
[15:03:21] <aaronmcadam> hit that link and play
[15:03:51] <aaronmcadam> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=hasClass
[15:04:58] <Wilto> Something something “hasNoClass” joke.
[15:05:11] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: nice and fast
[15:05:21] <aaronmcadam> uhuh
[15:05:35] <aaronmcadam> it's really handy
[15:12:13] <toddparker> so kinblas are you working on the enhancement optimization?
[15:12:23] <toddparker> think that will be killer
[15:12:47] <kinblas> toddparker: I will in a bit, finishing up the first-page dup bug
[15:12:54] <toddparker> ok, sorry
[15:12:58] <toddparker> too excited :)
[15:13:01] <kinblas> lol
[15:13:05] <toddparker> i'm leaving n a bit
[15:13:06] <kinblas> toddparker: it's good to be excited
[15:13:20] <toddparker> but let me know if there is more tinkering I can do tonight on the other scrolling slowness
[15:13:30] <toddparker> any ideas on what we could safely do now?
[15:13:32] <kinblas> toddparker: I'll do one tree with the optimization and one without and do some timing comparisons
[15:13:41] <toddparker> cool
[15:13:55] <kinblas> I've been meaning to do that since the decoupling
[15:14:17] <aaronmcadam> i'm guessing enhancement is where the DOM heavy stuff happens
[15:14:49] <toddparker> yeah
[15:15:29] <aaronmcadam> that's critical then
[15:15:44] <aaronmcadam> could be where the android perf problems come from
[15:15:59] <toddparker> could be
[15:16:09] <toddparker> this would mainly make page laoding/changing slow
[15:16:19] <toddparker> we have more stuff to look at to smooth out scrolling next
[15:16:38] <toddparker> we need to sped things up for 1.0
[15:18:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:19:08] <aaronmcadam> but if the dom has been created already, what's causing the scrolling issues?
[15:25:22] <toddparker> scrolling is a whole pile of complex stuff - touch event binding, rendering speed for corners/gradients, how much of the viewport is rendered ahead of time, etc.
[15:25:41] <toddparker> ask kinblas  ;)
[15:25:47] <Wilto> Just a quick heads-up before I bail for the evening: I’m tracking down the issue with Android selects tonight/tomorrow morning. It is, at first blush, even weirder than previously expected. So.
[15:26:02] <Wilto> Should have an update by tomorrow afternoon.
[15:26:07] <Wilto> Or, fingers crossed, a fix.
[15:26:32] <kinblas> Wilto: btw, it isn't reproduceable in the emulator
[15:26:44] <Wilto> Curiouser and curiouser.
[15:27:20] <kinblas> Wilto: I was going to write a bookmarklet that can allow us to watch what touch/mouse events are being triggered
[15:27:22] <kinblas> on the device
[15:27:24] <aaronmcadam> what's the issue?
[15:27:28] <aaronmcadam> I can help test
[15:28:27] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: I don't have the issue number handy
[15:28:34] <aaronmcadam> no prob :)
[15:28:37] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: but ... if you load the form gallery
[15:28:44] <kinblas> on an Android device
[15:28:52] <Wilto> aaronmcadam: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1077
[15:28:52] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1077 on jquery-mobile, reported by chenchen (8m, 1w ago): Native select Menu no event on Adroid 2.2 or above
[15:28:59] <aaronmcadam> yeah ah thanks wilto
[15:29:09] <kinblas> Wilto: thanks!
[15:29:10] <Wilto> But, it’s only after navigating to a page after AJAX or opening a non-native select.
[15:29:37] <Wilto> Intentionally breaking the non-native select JS solves the issue.
[15:29:52] <kinblas> Wilto: ??
[15:30:08] <Wilto> And I’ve done a bunch of rooting through the CSS today, and it’s looking less and less like a CSS thing.
[15:30:16] <Wilto> Removing that position: fixed; change didn’t seem to do it.
[15:31:21] <Wilto> It’s a weird one for sure, but I’m on it.
[15:33:40] <Wilto> kinblas: Just saying, when the non-native select doesn’t fire at all, the problem goes away. It doesn’t narrow it down much.
[15:35:01] <kinblas> Wilto: yeah wierd, I wanted to do the bookmarklet to see what the actual target of the touch/click was
[15:37:37] <Wilto> That would be sweet.
[15:37:52] <Wilto> But either way, I’m closing in on it. Let you guys know what I turn up tomorrow.
[15:37:55] <Wilto> Have a good one.
[15:38:07] <johnbender> Wilto: awesome, see you then
[16:10:04] <johnbender> kinblas: we scroll down on page load to hide the navigation bar right?
[16:10:11] <johnbender> the 1px scroll
[16:11:02] <gseguin> johnbender: that's correct
[16:11:55] <johnbender> gseguin: do you know where that is in the nav code or if we provide a way to disable it?
[16:12:18] * gseguin checks
[16:12:28] <johnbender> acking now
[16:12:59] <johnbender> gseguin: found it
[16:13:03] <johnbender> line 500 nav
[16:13:11] <gseguin> you're faster than my effing IDE
[16:13:13] <gseguin> :)
[16:14:00] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll let him know if he really wants to change that he can set that defaultHomeScroll value to 0
[16:14:12] <johnbender> context required
[16:14:16] <kinblas> johnbender: correct

[16:14:19] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2846 on jquery-mobile, reported by tucsonlabs (51m, 24s ago): Page Jumps 1px on page transition (iOS)
[16:14:33] <kinblas> johnbender: the amount we scroll differs depending on the platforms/OS
[16:14:56] <johnbender> kinblas: based on scrolling support I see
[16:15:47] <gseguin> johnbender: different subject
[16:16:02] <gseguin> have you started the AMD task?
[16:16:14] <gseguin> is that pre 1.0 or post?
[16:18:50] <johnbender> gseguin: post and I started in so far as I looked into it and set a plan for myself
[16:19:34] <johnbender> gseguin: I was hoping to find a way to define the dependencies outside of the libraries themselves
[16:19:44] <johnbender> though I don't think adding some require statements at the top of the files is that bad
[16:19:51] <johnbender> also keep in mind
[16:20:02] <johnbender> the statements I'm making here are based on my understanding of how amd works
[16:20:05] <johnbender> which may be wrong
[16:20:18] <johnbender> and specifically the require.js optimizer etc
[16:20:40] <johnbender> so if I say something stupid please correct me
[16:21:01] <gseguin> nothing stupid yet ;)
[16:21:06] <johnbender> yay!
[16:21:08] <johnbender> thats good
[16:21:12] <johnbender> *that's
[16:22:21] <gseguin> so I think it's great to adopt AMD
[16:23:01] <gseguin> the thing we want to make sure is that we put a shim for people who will use jqm without an AMD loader
[16:23:09] <gseguin> but I'm sure you've already thought about that
[16:23:32] <johnbender> gseguin: well that's why I wanted to find a way to define the deps outside the files if possible
[16:23:42] <johnbender> even if the only thing we get out of it is a dep tree
[16:23:46] <gseguin> we can use almond.js
[16:23:55] <gseguin> I think it's 750 bytes
[16:25:42] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll have take a look, does that get us a dep tree?
[16:26:20] <gseguin> so the define wrappers around all our modules will get that to you
[16:26:42] <gseguin> and then with r.js we can output several bundles
[16:26:45] <johnbender> cool
[16:26:53] <gseguin> one that's an amd module
[16:27:04] <johnbender> I still thing it's worth while to find a way to just generate the dependecy graph and do the rest ourselves
[16:27:14] <gseguin> and one that include almond.js which will shim the amd loader functions
[16:27:29] <johnbender> I don't think we can bring in outside deps like that
[16:28:05] <johnbender> amd is just a spec and what tools we use to build our packages is up to us but we have to be pretty sensitive to external project dependencies
[16:28:09] <johnbender> I think at least
[16:28:20] <johnbender> my 2c
[16:28:58] <johnbender> what I was really hoping for was some way to generate the tree, and work with said tree to get us the desired output
[16:29:08] <johnbender> sans any code modification inside the modules themselves
[16:29:20] <gseguin> yeah yeah totally but the good thing is that AMD is a spec and so that should leave us free of deciding which tool we use to build our code
[16:29:33] <johnbender> true
[16:30:58] <johnbender> I'm curious then what the core guys are doing with their require/define calls
[16:31:10] <johnbender> we should probably take a look
[16:31:12] <gseguin> yeah, I don't have a problem with modifying the code
[16:31:32] <johnbender> gseguin: just doing a shim like you mentioned makes sense
[16:31:56] <gseguin> I think the php thing we have today for the source is much more of a constraint than depending on an AMD loader
[16:32:32] <gseguin> I hate that I have to run a PHP enabled server to be able to load JS files
[16:33:06] <gseguin> plus it'll make debugging so much easier since with AMD each module will appear in your scripts
[16:33:51] <gseguin> anyways, maybe it's not the best time to talk about that
[16:34:36] <gseguin> I'll give it a try if you don't mind as I'm still warm from doing it with our Jive codebase and I'll put it in a branch
[16:35:16] <johnbender> gseguin: hell yah
[16:35:19] <johnbender> go for it
[16:35:28] <johnbender> and I don't like having a php dep either
[16:35:40] <johnbender> I've sequestered that crap inside a vm :D
