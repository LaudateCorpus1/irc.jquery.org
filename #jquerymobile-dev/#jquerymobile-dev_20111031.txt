[06:26:50] <impi> heya guys
[06:27:05] <impi> i am using datebox from jquery mobile, and i am struggeling to get access to my date
[06:29:06] <impi> is there a way I can do something like: http://www.pastie.org/2787941
[06:30:17] <impi> I have tried to get the $('#my-id').val(); <-- but this wont work as I got multiple date inputs and it only gets the date of the first input. but I am not looking to get the value, rather gain access to the date object
[07:26:26] <Wilto> impi: This is a channel for the jQuery Mobile developers to collaborate on the project—for general support, you’ll want to hit up #jquerymobile.
[07:27:08] <impi> Wilto, thanks man, i will do that. you guys really rock btw
[07:27:47] <Wilto> Thanks, man!
[07:41:41] <toddmparker_> happy halloween everybody

[07:53:26] <toddmparker_> Apparently Seaside is an implementation of Smalltalk (yeah from the 80's)
[07:53:49] <toddmparker_> their docs seem familiar
[07:59:16] <Wilto> I’m looking forward to seeing someone make jQM work on a punchcard.

[10:14:28] <johnbender> kinblas: toddparker: I replied to the fella who gave me a lead on the UIWebView issue
[10:14:39] <johnbender> nothing so far
[10:14:40] <johnbender> :(
[10:15:57] <kinblas> I still think it's not our bug ... and maybe something we should file on android UIWebView?
[10:16:07] <kinblas> we need a minimal test case though
[10:17:36] <toddmparker_> which bug is that?
[10:28:48] <toddmparker_> hey kinblas -Q for you
[10:31:46] <johnbender> toddmparker_: this guy has an issue with a vanilla web view in ios where the back button doesn't work
[10:32:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: also the link appears to work fine in the windows phone 7 emulator
[10:32:05] <johnbender> BUT!
[10:32:06] <_|Nix|_> Hey! I;m the guy who submitted pull request #2288 ... I'm just wondering how precisely to package my colour picker button ... It consists of a button, a popup window, and a colour picker widget which pops up when you click on the button. So, I figure I could submit three separate widgets which work together to produce the colour picker button ...
[10:32:26] <johnbender> the browser is showing rounded corners which means I think it's using the 7.5 browser :(
[10:32:27] <_|Nix|_> ... unless you really want me to squash everything into one big widget ...
[10:32:31] <johnbender> can't tell in the emulator
[10:32:48] <_|Nix|_> Which way should I go?
[10:33:12] <toddmparker_> johnbender: what's the ticket #?
[10:33:23] <_|Nix|_> I mean, I could also put all three widgets into one .js/.css pair and not add the auto-enhance thing for popupwindow and hsvpicker ...
[10:33:25] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: hi!
[10:33:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Hey!
[10:33:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2190
[10:33:38] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2190 on jquery-mobile, reported by josh-h (2m, 4w ago): Unable to close dialog within a UIWebView on iOS
[10:34:03] <toddmparker_> here's my thought - your picker should probably be considered a polyfill enhancement for input type="color"
[10:34:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: "polyfill enhancement"?
[10:34:37] <toddmparker_> so if you add in your plugin, it would take that input and maybe add the color picker button to the right of the input
[10:34:50] <toddmparker_> so you could still type in a hex
[10:34:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Oh, like slider?
[10:35:01] <toddmparker_> we could show how to hide hte input with css if you don't want that
[10:35:11] <toddmparker_> but hte input should be used for accessibility and submitting
[10:35:17] <toddmparker_> yeah, same pattern
[10:35:40] <toddmparker_> input type isn't really supported so your script polyfills it to work
[10:35:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: That's easily done, but it's still quite a complex widget, whose pieces can be useful by themselves.
[10:36:20] <toddmparker_> yeah, i understand
[10:36:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: So, what should I do about that?
[10:36:45] <toddmparker_> so the popup should be it's own plugin
[10:36:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: do you have link?
[10:37:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: To my colour picker widget?
[10:37:33] <toddmparker_> i guess it' sbest to try and keep these as separate plugins so there will be dependencies
[10:38:01] <toddmparker_> ultimately, i fyou want to enahance a input type=color, it would work as described
[10:38:30] <toddmparker_> but there would be underlying plugin dependencies: color library, overlay, color picker, etc.
[10:38:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Yeah. popupwindow can also make this possible: <div id="myPopupwindow"></div><a id="myButton" data-role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-owns="#myPopupwindow">Click to show popup</a>
[10:39:06] <toddmparker_> cool
[10:39:19] <toddmparker_> so the href="#myPopupwindow"?
[10:40:03] <toddmparker_> actually, would be cool to generate all the airria stuff by the plugin
[10:40:19] <toddmparker_> and use the same data-rel pattern as dialog
[10:40:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: $(document).bind("pagecreate"), function(e) { $("[aria-haspopup='true']").bind("vclick", ...)
[10:40:38] <toddmparker_> <a href="#myPopupwindow" data-rel="overlay">
[10:40:52] <toddmparker_> we do the rest, provided that plugin is there
[10:41:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK, but where's the button that opens the popupwindow?
[10:41:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: NP. I get it.
[10:41:44] <_|Nix|_> s/NP/NM/
[10:41:54] <toddmparker_> i was just talking about the pattern for the overlay plugin
[10:42:15] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes a link to the pull I 2288 get's me nothing :D
[10:42:26] <toddmparker_> like i said above for the color picker, if you had that plugin in the page, it would auto-enhance the input type="color"
[10:42:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK, so what I call "popupwindow" you call "overlay" ...
[10:42:50] <toddmparker_> part of that would be for the puling to add in that button
[10:42:57] <toddmparker_> yeah, sorry terminology
[10:43:05] <toddmparker_> maybe just popup
[10:43:10] <toddmparker_> keep it short
[10:43:38] <toddmparker_> bad typing above
[10:44:02] <toddmparker_> the plugin would add the button next to the input that would open the picker popup
[10:44:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK, so let's take it one step at a time ... let's start with popupwindow, rename it to popup, implement the <a href="#myPopupwindow" data-rel="popup">, and then move on to hsvpicker, and then, finally, to colorpickerbutton ....
[10:44:51] <toddmparker_> i agree that starting simple woudl be good
[10:45:09] <toddmparker_> the best way to start would be to create a new wiki page for this to plan the API
[10:45:23] <toddmparker_> id' try to follow the dialog api as much as we can
[10:45:34] <toddmparker_> need to think about theming support
[10:45:51] <toddmparker_> you'd add that to the popup content wrapper
[10:46:18] <toddmparker_> <div data-role="popup" data-theme="d" data-overlay-theme="a">
[10:46:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Yeah, currently the button searches upwards in the DOM to find ui-body-[a-z] and passes that to the popup ...
[10:46:33] <toddmparker_> the theme is the swactch for the popup contents
[10:46:58] <toddmparker_> it can use the inhertiance model for sure
[10:47:06] <toddmparker_> but having and option to set it in addition is the pattern
[10:47:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Right, but but if no theme is specified, it should grab the theme from the button, so it blends in ...
[10:51:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Isn't there a redundancy between <div data-role="popup" ... /> and <a href="#myPopupwindow" data-rel="popup" ... />?
[10:52:22] <_|Nix|_> I think the latter is sufficient in order to indicate which div to turn into a popup ...
[10:53:14] <_|Nix|_> But, I guess, for clarity, we should also mark the div to indicate that "this div will be turned into a popup".
[11:08:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/jquery-mobile/docs/forms/colorpickerbutton/
[11:08:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Sorry ... got sidetracked ...
[11:13:14] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: this does seem like a pretty big thing to plan out
[11:14:44] <toddmparker_> if you want to create these as personal plugins an follow our conventions as much as possible, we may be able to use simpler tools like popups as a start for our official plugin
[11:15:10] <toddmparker_> but if you do these as personal plugins, they will get out sooner which is good
[11:15:21] <toddmparker_> we're sort of heads down on 1.0
[11:15:54] <eddiemonge> i feel like thats not a common form component and should be a plugin
[11:18:08] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: the checkboxes on this page look disabled in the unchecked state: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/checkboxes/
[11:19:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK. I've started on the popup.
[11:19:15] <JNice> Guys... is there a public jQM roadmap somewhere?
[11:19:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I'm gonna use this "API": <div id="myPopupWindow" data-role="popup" data-theme="d" data-overlay-theme="a"></div> … <a href="#myPopupWindow" data-rel="popup">
[11:19:47] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: this will be a plugin, actually a non-official plugin that we aren't maintaining
[11:19:53] <toddmparker_> just givig some advice
[11:20:24] <toddmparker_> ot so sure i agree on the checkboxes
[11:20:38] <toddmparker_> remember, this is going to be theme influenced
[11:22:16] <eddiemonge> the theme is going to change the image?
[11:22:59] <toddmparker_> maybe the stroke around it? the button itself for sure
[11:23:32] <eddiemonge> is the image supposed to be slightly or mostly transparent?

[11:23:40] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by mralex (12m, 23s ago): Update form button text on refresh.
[11:23:42] <johnbender> grabbing that one
[11:23:45] <johnbender> going to add some tests
[11:23:51] <johnbender> maybe a single test
[11:24:22] <toddmparker_> cool johnbender
[11:27:47] <eddiemonge> johnbender: should that attr be prop instead?
[11:29:40] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'm not sure since I don't know when browsers behave best with regard to the disabled expando
[11:29:47] <johnbender> eddiemonge: is there a disabled expando attr?
[11:30:02] * johnbender likes saying "expando" out loud and in his mind
[11:30:44] <johnbender> eddiemonge: reading the spec
[11:33:35] <johnbender> eddiemonge: between the jquery prop() documentation and the spec it appears it should be a prop call yes
[11:34:13] <eddiemonge> attr only checks the initial value whereas prop checks the actual current state
[11:34:25] <johnbender> eddiemonge: readability wise I think $el.is(":disabled") would be nicer but possibly slower for no real gain
[11:35:12] <eddiemonge> yup
[11:35:41] <johnbender> eddiemonge: aside from being part of the team where is that documented
[11:35:41] <eddiemonge> prop is only 1 character longer than that though
[11:36:09] <johnbender> the prop docs suggest that attr previously would do some checking for you and I thought they switched it back
[11:36:15] <johnbender> at least partially
[11:36:28] <eddiemonge> partially but not reliably
[11:36:43] <johnbender> yah thats what the docs say
[11:36:45] <johnbender> sigh
[11:37:02] <johnbender> it's been extremely hard to find a definitive description of how those two interact
[11:37:05] <eddiemonge> its kind of hinted in the 1.6 release notes
[11:37:06] <eddiemonge> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/03/jquery-16-released/
[11:37:09] <johnbender> yours is the only statement that I've seen
[11:37:22] <Wilto> Huh, I didn’t know they rolled it back.
[11:37:27] <Wilto> (to some degree.)
[11:37:31] <johnbender> yah they switched it back sort of
[11:37:33] <johnbender> from what i know
[11:37:38] <johnbender> that's what I'm looking for
[11:37:44] <johnbender> did they basically roll back the change
[11:37:53] <johnbender> and keep prop in place for people who desire consistency ?
[11:38:03] <eddiemonge> actually this is better doc http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/12/jquery-1-6-1-released/
[11:38:04] <johnbender> eddiemonge: in which case it's the clear winner here (which it is either way)
[11:38:49] <johnbender> eddiemonge: so they completely rolled it back but left prop in there
[11:39:14] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ahh
[11:39:15] <johnbender> there it is
[11:39:20] <eddiemonge> It is still recommended that .prop() be used when setting these boolean attributes/properties, but your code will continue working in jQuery 1.6.1 even if these use cases are not switched to use the .prop() method.
[11:39:23] <johnbender> Properties are what the browser uses to keep track of the current values. Normally, properties reflect their corresponding attributes (if they exist). This is not the case with boolean attributes. Boolean properties stay up to date when the user clicks a checkbox or selects an option in a select element. The corresponding boolean attributes do not.
[11:40:04] <johnbender> being that disabled is such a boolean
[11:40:08] <johnbender> eddiemonge: YOU ARE CORRECT!
[11:40:10] <johnbender> without a doubt
[11:40:22] <eddiemonge> pssh i know!
[11:40:28] <johnbender> eddiemonge: thanks for helping me clarify
[11:40:31] <eddiemonge> lol jk, im not always correct
[11:42:55] <eddiemonge> part of the fun of being on the api docs team for core is that i sometimes know where to find helpful info like that
[11:43:24] <johnbender> well if nothing else you've increased the likelyhood that I'll pester you for information :D
[11:43:34] <eddiemonge> dont you always?
[11:44:08] <toddmparker_> hey guys - i'm heading out in a few to get ready for halloween

[11:45:08] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2603 on jquery-mobile, reported by jpfiset (3w, 6d ago): Add ability to disable/enable buttons in navbar
[11:45:16] <toddmparker_> more disabling links - on a navbar
[11:45:21] <toddmparker_> WHY
[11:45:56] <Wilto> To keep users on their toes, man.
[11:45:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: as a heads up I'm off from Weds on
[11:46:02] <Wilto> Keep ‘em guessing.
[11:46:04] <eddiemonge> i think the button should be non-existent if disabled
[11:46:20] <eddiemonge> can you disable nav buttons in native iOS?
[11:46:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to try and be online for the meeting though
[11:47:09] <johnbender> gseguin: I've been using the linting service for so long now I'm definitely spoiled by it
[11:47:36] <toddmparker_> not sure eddiemonge
[11:47:58] <toddmparker_> it's easy for people to add/remove the ui-disabled class
[11:48:07] <gseguin> johnbender: the one running on my Smartmachine or one that you host?
[11:48:10] <toddmparker_> but i'm not convined we want to build it into links
[11:48:36] <Wilto> I vote we disable every link by default.
[11:48:44] <johnbender> gseguin: smartmachine
[11:48:45] <Wilto> …I’ve had a lot of coffee today.
[11:51:02] <eddiemonge> does that mean you are calmer today?
[11:51:21] <Wilto> Saner, probably.
[11:51:56] <JNice> hey guys does anyone have a roadmap I can take a look at?
[11:53:53] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Feature-Requests
[11:54:10] <JNice> ty sir
[11:54:15] <eddiemonge> not sure how updated it is though
[11:59:53] <toddmparker_> that wiki page isn't vetted/prioritized either
[12:04:05] <Wilto> ?mlm
[12:04:05] <bot-t> much like myself
[12:06:18] <johnbender> eddiemonge: another issue with that pull is that he references the text wrapper inside the button with the class :(
[12:06:53] <johnbender> want to limit dependence on the classes where possibel
[12:09:30] <eddiemonge> why was it text or value? is the text for options?
[12:11:18] <johnbender> lunch brb
[13:04:55] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I didn't understand your question
[13:05:15] <eddiemonge> sorry, what is $el in this? an input or a button?
[13:05:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: button
[13:05:33] <johnbender> well
[13:05:40] <johnbender> buttonMarkup widget too
[13:05:49] <johnbender> I'd love to ahve a reference to the text wrapper element
[13:06:32] <johnbender> or at the vey least designate it as a textwrapper in some way that isn't tied to it's class
[13:07:44] <eddiemonge> im actually confused by line 90
[13:07:47] <eddiemonge> whats it doing?
[13:08:16] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ah sorry
[13:08:19] <johnbender> $el is the input
[13:08:28] <eddiemonge> like what is "this" in that that context?
[13:08:31] <johnbender> should have double checked before I said that
[13:08:39] <johnbender> this is the widget
[13:08:57] <johnbender> the element is the input
[13:09:10] <johnbender> so what it's doing is updating the text of the enhanced markup button
[13:09:24] <johnbender> from the text of the underlying input on refresh
[13:09:29] <johnbender> whether it's disabled or not
[13:10:39] <eddiemonge> when/where does ui-btn-text get applied?
[13:12:09] <johnbender> eddiemonge: in the call to buttonMarkup on line 30 of the button widget
[13:12:24] <johnbender> confused yet :)
[13:14:16] <eddiemonge> yeah i am
[13:14:29] <johnbender> eddiemonge: the button situation is confusing
[13:14:47] <johnbender> especially because the buttonMarkup widget isn't actually a widget at all
[13:14:51] <johnbender> just a helper function
[13:15:04] <johnbender> which actually makes sense
[13:15:26] <Wilto> Also, “The Button Situation” would be a good name for a Kraftwerk cover band.
[13:17:29] <johnbender> but can be confusing
[13:58:32] <eddiemonge> ?mlu @ johnbender

[14:43:07] <johnbender> I submitted a support request too
[14:43:13] <johnbender> but twitter will get this done faster
[14:43:44] <johnbender> if it's going to get done at all
[14:43:55] <kinblas> is that your way of forcing people to fill in a template to give us more info?
[14:44:28] <gseguin> +1
[14:46:14] <johnbender> kinblas: yep
[14:46:25] <johnbender> when we file bugs against android and chrome they have a template
[14:46:55] <johnbender> also I don't want to force anything, people who have a way more detailed set of information should be allowed to go beyond what the template suggests
[14:47:15] <johnbender> but it would be nice to point them at jsfiddle or jsbin and give them some things like ...
[14:47:21] <johnbender> expected behavior
[14:47:26] <kinblas> yeah
[14:47:27] <johnbender> actual behavior
[14:47:29] <johnbender> that ALONE
[14:47:31] <johnbender> would be amazing
[14:47:43] <johnbender> because have the time I don't know what th expectation is from _either side_
[14:47:46] <kinblas> "my links don't work. what's wrong?"
[14:47:48] <johnbender> *half
[14:48:18] <johnbender> kinblas: yah that's the pathalogical case
[14:48:34] <kinblas> heh
[14:50:46] <kinblas> toddparker: Wilto: gseguin: Do we really allow folks to theme individual listview *items*?
[14:51:17] <kinblas> I see it in the listview code, I was just curious if that was intentional or not
[14:52:08] <gseguin> does that cause a performance problem?
[14:52:10] <johnbender> kinblas: I want to style each letter in the link with data-link-text-index-at-0-wrapper-styling="--webkit-transform ..."
[14:52:31] <kinblas> johnbender: heh
[14:52:32] * johnbender is giving toddmparker_ a hard time
[14:53:06] <kinblas> gseguin: at this point I'm just looking at what we are doing ... .refresh() is where we spend almost all our time
[14:53:46] <johnbender> toddmparker_: going to the UK in february eh!?
[14:53:53] <kinblas> gseguin: all 8.5 seconds of my profile build :-)
[14:54:01] <gseguin> ouch
[14:54:23] <kinblas> gseguin: johnbender: you guys catch my email?
[14:54:53] <gseguin> kinblas: I did see it, sorry no reply
[14:55:08] <kinblas> ah, but did you read it? :-P
[14:55:12] <gseguin> I just felt re-assured that I did not miss something obvious
[14:55:14] <gseguin> yes
[14:55:16] <kinblas> som interesting stuff in there
[14:55:23] <gseguin> indeed
[14:55:24] <kinblas> s/som/some
[14:55:37] <gseguin> great investigative work
[14:57:23] <kinblas> gseguin: eh, all I did was print the data structure :-)
[15:18:45] <eddiemonge> print? as in an actual printer?
[15:19:21] <johnbender> System.out.println ?
[15:19:41] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #190: SUCCESS in 11 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/190/
[15:19:41] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * alex: Update form button text on refresh.
[15:19:42] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: switched to prop per @eddiemonge
[15:19:42] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: reference the buttonMarkup text wrapper element through data
[15:19:43] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: test that the text and val can update the parent button markup
[15:20:04] <johnbender> do { data <- getDataFromFile; printLn data } ?
[15:20:10] <johnbender> console.log(data) ?
[15:20:22] <johnbender> I guess that should have been ...
[15:20:28] <johnbender> main = do { data <- getDataFromFile; printLn data } ?
[15:23:23] <eddiemonge> what is that in?
[15:24:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: seriously though
[15:24:20] <johnbender> I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders
[15:26:45] <eddiemonge> i feel like im missing out :(
[15:27:42] <johnbender> thinking about things like the transitions in the light of the platform we're on feels so much better than kowtowing to what is supposed to be right according to the native platforms on which we're deployed
[15:28:28] <johnbender> eddiemonge: you're on the transitions email
[15:28:53] <eddiemonge> when was kinblas' response? was it an older one or a recent one?
[15:29:42] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I don't think kin has responded
[15:29:58] <kinblas> johnbender: I haven't responded yet :-)
[15:30:27] <kinblas> I meant to prefix that with eddiemonge
[15:30:33] <eddiemonge> poor RIM: http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/31/canalys-htc-nips-apple-samsung-to-become-top-smartphone-vendor/
[15:31:05] <eddiemonge> kinblas: i havent responded yet either but then i havent had much time to look at transitions even though i really want to
[15:31:32] <kinblas> yeah I'm trying to focus ...
[15:32:32] <johnbender> kinblas: lol
[15:32:42] <eddiemonge> twitter has some seriously smooth transitions on iphone
[15:32:51] <eddiemonge> although their pages arent very complex
[15:33:24] <kinblas> what transitions do they have?
[15:33:40] <eddiemonge> right to left slide
[15:33:48] <kinblas> those are native windows though
[15:33:56] <kinblas> or native views/panels
[15:34:09] <kinblas> they have webviews *in* them
[15:34:19] <eddiemonge> no, in safari
[15:34:41] <kinblas> oh hmm, I never use twitter in the browser, probably should check it out
[15:52:28] <eddiemonge> whats the reasoning behind using .attr instead of .data for something like this: el.attr( "data-" + $.mobile.ns + "theme", o.theme )
[15:52:53] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I think we want it to be represented in the dom
[15:53:02] <johnbender> or that's why I would do that
[15:53:15] <eddiemonge> for what reason?
[15:53:17] <johnbender> for debugging purposes / semantics?
[15:53:36] <eddiemonge> but since its added in js, neither of those apply
[15:53:44] <johnbender> ?
[15:54:11] <johnbender> if you look at the element after the theme has been applied it's in the dom
[15:54:22] <johnbender> you can just inspect and see it there
[15:54:41] <johnbender> also depending on what the el is, if something else is going to consume it later
[15:54:46] <johnbender> that will determin themeing
[15:55:20] <johnbender> so the consumer doesn't have to reach into the data it can just behave as it would with a user defined element with the data theme attr

[15:55:24] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by goujona (8h, 38m ago): Adding swipeup and swipedown events
[15:55:32] <johnbender> is it just me or does that conflict with scrolling ?
[15:56:47] <eddiemonge> seems like it
[15:57:44] <johnbender> just double checking :P
[15:57:51] * kinblas shaves 2 seconds off his 9 second page load
[15:58:00] * johnbender cheers for kinblas 
[15:58:28] <kinblas> johnbender: hmmm, some of the nice jquery methods like wrapInner() are way slower than just creating the nodes ourselves
[15:58:43] <johnbender> kinblas: I can imagine
[15:58:49] <johnbender> I was just looking at the buttonMarkup
[15:59:13] <kinblas> johnbender: ok that one liner, I just replaced it with like 15 lines and shaved 2 seconds
[15:59:17] <johnbender> and where it does the wrapInner at the bottom all I could think was "how does it know where to put the inner content ??
[15:59:34] <kinblas> I think it follows the firstChild path all the way down
[15:59:44] <johnbender> kinblas: is it at the bottom of buttonMarkup?
[15:59:47] <johnbender> by chance?
[15:59:53] <johnbender> the each callback?
[16:00:12] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah I replaced this:
[16:00:13] <kinblas> 		wrap = ( "<D class='" + innerClass + "' aria-hidden='true'><D class='ui-btn-text'></D>" +
[16:00:13] <kinblas> 			( o.icon ? "<span class='" + iconClass + "'></span>" : "" ) +
[16:00:14] <kinblas> 			"</D>" ).replace( /D/g, o.wrapperEls );
[16:00:14] <kinblas> 		el.wrapInner( wrap );
[16:00:25] <kinblas> with a loop that creates the 3 nodes by hand
[16:00:31] <johnbender> yes!
[16:00:43] <johnbender> I just added a little snippet after that you'll be able to make less crappy!
[16:00:46] <johnbender> w00t
[16:00:55] <johnbender> there's a TODO in there just below that
[16:00:59] <johnbender> rebase!
[16:01:14] <kinblas> it's in master?
[16:01:17] <johnbender> yes
[16:01:28] <kinblas> ah ok, I haven't checked anything in yet (to a branch)
[16:01:32] <kinblas> I'm just dorking with stuff
[16:01:35] <kinblas> to see where the wins are
[16:01:41] <kinblas> apparently that's one place :-D
[16:01:54] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js#L79
[16:02:04] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js#L74
[16:02:33] <johnbender> if you have reference to the text node it would be great if you could replace the find
[16:02:44] <kinblas> oh heh
[16:02:49] <kinblas> we'll be able to get rid of that find
[16:02:54] <johnbender> YAY!
[16:03:00] <kinblas> I have the handle to the textClass element
[16:03:10] <kinblas> btw
[16:03:18] <kinblas> buttonMarkup can be called on more than one element
[16:03:24] <kinblas> that is ... a collection
[16:03:36] <johnbender> ?
[16:03:57] <kinblas> so is that line going to set 'textWrapper' to all of the textClass elements in the el collection?
[16:04:09] <kinblas> $("a").buttonMarkup();
[16:04:17] <kinblas> el can be all 'anchors' inthe doc
[16:04:33] <johnbender> kinblas: el is the specific element
[16:04:39] <johnbender> it's inside an each callback eh?
[16:04:51] <kinblas> johnbender: el = $( this )
[16:04:54] <kinblas> this is a collection
[16:05:00] <kinblas> which could have more than one element in it
[16:05:19] <johnbender> kinblas: its inside an each callback this is a collection member
[16:05:23] <kinblas> that's always the case for $.fn.* functions
[16:05:26] <johnbender> unless I'm reading this wrong or something
[16:05:32] <kinblas> oh
[16:05:33] <kinblas> damn
[16:05:34] <kinblas> ok
[16:05:35] <kinblas> yeah
[16:05:37] <kinblas> you're in an each
[16:05:37] <johnbender> whew
[16:05:45] <johnbender> I thought I was taking crazy pills
[16:05:50] <kinblas> ok that make sit easier than
[16:05:53] <kinblas> I can lose the loop
[16:05:54] <kinblas> :-)
[16:05:59] <johnbender> cool
[16:06:10] <kinblas> oh hey-oh
[16:06:15] <kinblas> that's another optimization right there
[16:06:17] <kinblas> lose the each()
[16:06:28] <kinblas> that's 400 function calls we don't need in my test case
[16:07:50] <kinblas> johnbender: turns out buttonMarkup is one of our key places to tune because *EVERYTHING* uses it
[16:07:59] <kinblas> so anything we can eek out of there is a win
[16:08:18] <johnbender> kinblas: yay for centralized performance problems ?? :x
[16:08:29] <kinblas> heh
[16:28:01] <johnbender> holy god save me:
[16:28:01] <johnbender> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3179505
[16:28:16] <johnbender> that puts my stomach in knots
[16:49:17] <jzaefferer> ?tell johnbender he should've used jslint
[16:49:17] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[19:33:13] <Wilto> ?os
[19:33:13] <bot-t> oh snao™
