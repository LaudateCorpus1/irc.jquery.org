[00:06:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is there some kind of override to not set the background on children of ui-popup-container?
[00:07:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm adding ui-body-x to the popup div, and it's not having any effect on the background. The font colour does, however change.
[00:07:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what do you mean? background isn't inherited
[00:08:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the problem with the examples is caused by custom CSS for the docs
[00:08:07] <uGoMobi> fixing that right now
[00:08:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Open the tooltip popup. It's transparent, although the popup div (not the container) has ui-body-e set.
[00:08:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is that also because of the custom docs CSS?
[00:08:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[00:08:48] <uGoMobi> 	.type-home .ui-content,
[00:08:48] <uGoMobi> 	.type-interior .ui-content {
[00:08:48] <uGoMobi> 		padding: 0;
[00:08:48] <uGoMobi> 		background: url(../images/px-ccc.gif) 50% 0 repeat-y;
[00:08:48] <uGoMobi> 	}
[00:09:22] <_|Nix|_> Aha, OK ... so then https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4750 is not really a problem, right?
[00:09:23] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4750 on jquery-mobile (toddparker; 4h, 51m ago): Popup: If the data-theme is set on a popup, bg displays as none (transparent)
[00:09:23] <uGoMobi> that is setting the background of those popups to this .gif image only
[00:09:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think it is an issue
[00:14:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then can you please close #4750 when you have the docs looking OK? I'll assign you, since you're already working on it. Cool?
[00:14:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes sure
[00:16:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, what was the final take on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4743? Can I close that. We can, after all, do slide{,up,down,out} to get all four directions, right?
[00:16:49] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4743 on jquery-mobile (uGoMobi; 13h, 23m ago): Popup: transition direction reverse
[00:17:01] <_|Nix|_> s/\./?/
[00:17:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's assign it to me with label "docs"
[00:18:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[00:18:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we have to add a note somewhere that this only works for page/dialog transitions, not the popup
[00:19:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and I think it would be useful if we add a new transition left to right slide
[00:21:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[00:26:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Interestingly, themes work fine on iOS with current master.
[00:27:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: could that be cache?
[00:28:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll refresh the page.
[00:29:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Still good.
[00:29:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno how to clear the browser cache ... maybe settings, or something.
[00:29:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: strange, Todd also mentioned something like that
[00:30:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ok, so I hit "Clear History" and "Clear Data", or whatever ... lessee ...
[00:32:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you open the "popup with close button right" example... what do you see?
[00:32:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hold on - had to type in the whole URL again.
[00:32:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah, that can take a while ;-)
[00:33:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Tooltip is still fine, even after clearing the cache and whatnot.
[00:33:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "Popup with close button right" looks good.
[00:34:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: shorturl to /test/    ... http://goo.gl/zchXp
[00:35:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: BTW: Removing the popup container has its own problems: The tooltip currently has max-width: 350px set, so when the popup opens, the container div has max-width: window width - tolerance, and the popup div has 350px.
[00:35:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: or bookmark the QR-code http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=qr&chs=150x150&choe=UTF-8&chld=H&chl=http://goo.gl/zchXp
[00:35:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I need my local copy.
[00:35:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh ok
[00:35:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but if the container div is the same as the popup div, you can no longer have this little combination of max-width settings.
[00:36:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I think we may need to keep the container div.
[00:36:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see, didn't have time to test branch popup-without-container yet
[00:37:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The fact is, it makes some things possible, but it also makes some things impossible.
[00:37:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess it's a different world.
[00:37:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if that's the case we leave it in
[00:39:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can still set max-width if we don't have the container anymore, just need to use !important to override the window max-width set by the widget
[00:40:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but again, if removing the container has downsides as well we shouldn't do it
[00:40:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but does keeping it have downsides as well? If so, we need to see which one has fewer downsides.
[00:41:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: now I get it... on iOS the custom CSS @min-width 650px don't apply
[00:41:32] <uGoMobi> that's why it looks all fine
[00:42:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Typical Apple: "Aaah, you don't really want that. We know what you want better than you do!"
[00:42:13] <_|Nix|_> :)
[00:42:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  hehe actually that's not the case here....
[00:43:02] <uGoMobi> the custom CSS says it should only be applied to screens bigger than 650px
[00:43:13] <uGoMobi> that's not something Apple came up with
[00:43:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, you meant a media query.
[00:43:22] <uGoMobi> yup
[00:43:36] <_|Nix|_> Didn't see the @ there ...

[01:02:03] <_|Nix|_> Yes! I think I got the popups to not truncate on iOS!
[01:02:15] <_|Nix|_> I effectively close them and then re-open them.
[01:02:53] <_|Nix|_> Oh, and I have to close the popup on orientationchange, because that signal is emitted before resize. If I do it on resize, it's too late.

[01:45:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh yes... you fixed it!! issue is gone on Chrome as well!
[02:08:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we have to leave the container in... without it there are conflicts with transitions when adding custom CSS to position or style the popup
[02:43:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so the popup-without-container branch is dead.
[02:44:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now, lessee if my fix has caused Android to explode ;)
[02:45:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah RIP popup-without-container
[02:45:26] <uGoMobi> was worth trying though
[02:45:30] <_|Nix|_> Well, it has caused it to become less reliable. More often than before the popup is not centred :(

[02:56:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, there was some discussion about coding standards, and there was some rough consensus, so I figured I'd be proactive.
[03:10:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: +1 to that approach
[03:11:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is this the correct way to set an option? $( "#panel" ).popup('open', { y: h });
[03:11:43] <uGoMobi> h is a var in that example
[03:18:50] <uGoMobi> ah, it's working but there seems to be an issue with data-tolerance settings being ignored

[03:25:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Which tolerance is being ignored?
[03:26:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the bottom one
[03:26:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: WORKSFORME in FF13 ...
[03:27:04] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... breaks in Chrome ...
[03:27:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: also breaks in FF14
[03:28:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure yet it is the tolerance
[03:28:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  wait, this could be the padding I set
[03:31:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's not the tolerance, it is the popup not getting the full height of the container
[03:33:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, *whew* ...
[03:34:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure why that is, because this example worked yesterday
[03:34:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe I changed something by accident... not used to new JSBin yet
[03:35:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does jsbin keep the previous milestones in a list accessible somewhere?
[03:35:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... so you can go back in history?
[03:35:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think you need to open an account for that
[03:35:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is it free?
[03:35:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you haven't done that yet
[03:35:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I think so
[03:38:15] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I think orientationchange is looking pretty good.
[03:38:26] <_|Nix|_> ... even on Android 2.3.5 ...
[03:38:39] <_|Nix|_> I don't like the fact that I have to use a timeout though ...
[03:38:58] <_|Nix|_> I can't believe the window size / offset changes /after/ the resize event. Very bad!
[03:39:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, doesn't feel good, but it sure does look good!
[03:39:46] <uGoMobi> resize is a tricky event
[03:40:52] <uGoMobi> I still wonder when browsers re-render the page exactly
[03:41:15] <uGoMobi> because the window resize event is sometimes fired like 4 times
[03:41:26] <uGoMobi> depending on which browser you use
[03:41:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We need an "ipromiseiwontchangethewindowsizeanymoreforalongtimeunlesstheuserwigglesthedevicesomemore" event.
[03:42:03] <uGoMobi> lol
[03:42:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: On Android, when the location bar disappears, you get a barrage of resize events ...
[03:43:53] <uGoMobi> yeah hopeless

[04:11:43] <toddmparker_>  uGoMobi: looks like you fixed that docs.css issue
[04:11:54] <toddmparker_> though now popups seem to have a flat color only, no gradient
[04:12:07] <toddmparker_> i sort of like it, but worth nothing for discussion
[04:12:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I thought you added that rule
[04:12:28] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi: you're cranking
[04:12:44] <toddmparker_> i added it to that other branch
[04:12:54] <toddmparker_> did that get merged in?
[04:13:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: no popup-without-container is gone
[04:13:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: it wasn't my intention to remove gradients
[04:15:55] <toddmparker_> mine neither
[04:16:04] <toddmparker_> i think i was too aggressive with my css
[04:16:33] <toddmparker_> popup-without-container is merged into master or you guys decided to leave the wrapper
[04:16:39] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: the real issue is that our custom CSS is interfering with examples, maybe not only popup
[04:16:44] <toddmparker_> sorry, haven't fully caught up
[04:17:06] <toddmparker_> i know, worrysome
[04:17:30] <toddmparker_> i'd like to re-do the docs soon and fix that
[04:17:59] <toddmparker_> i think it's just a matter of better selectors or a smarter negation
[04:18:04] <toddmparker_> that dang gray line
[04:18:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: me too, got a whole lists of things to improve the docs already
[04:18:30] <uGoMobi> I think we should add classes
[04:18:39] <uGoMobi> and use those instead of generic selectors
[04:18:40] <toddmparker_> i eventually want to re-org all thew widgets together
[04:18:51] <toddmparker_> hard to find stuff
[04:19:01] <uGoMobi> true
[04:19:04] <toddmparker_> classes to what?
[04:19:22] <uGoMobi> to div[data-role="content"] for instance
[04:19:30] <toddmparker_> we don't want to clutter up docs markup with stuff that people shouldn't include
[04:19:33] <toddmparker_> that's the trick
[04:19:40] <agcolom> Quick hello :-)
[04:19:45] <toddmparker_> hey agcolom
[04:19:51] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom
[04:20:03] <agcolom> the firefox logo looks nice for demo jsbin.com/ejafoc/18
[04:20:20] <toddmparker_> the issue here is content is used as a parent and also inside the popup/dialog
[04:20:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: but we already add classes like type-interior
[04:20:38] <agcolom> Chris was asked to ask us for an official statement that we support FF
[04:20:40] <toddmparker_> if we can only apply the rule to the parent, but not children
[04:20:54] <toddmparker_> agcolom: FF on android?
[04:21:01] <agcolom> not sure
[04:21:05] <agcolom> I've asked for more details
[04:21:11] <toddmparker_> ok
[04:21:21] <toddmparker_> it's seemed half baked for so long
[04:21:22] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I tried with .type-interior > .ui-content and a reset at the end
[04:21:40] <toddmparker_> but if ff mobile is solid and being used we can all test more thoroughly on it
[04:21:43] <toddmparker_> add it to the matrix
[04:21:54] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: no dice?
[04:22:02] <agcolom> I think he doesn't know himself so he's asked those who asked him to ask us for some some info
[04:22:04] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Firefox logo is looking good!
[04:22:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: seems to solve it for now
[04:22:16] <toddmparker_> agcolom: cool
[04:22:20] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Man ... he should apply at the post office :)
[04:22:31] <toddmparker_> heh
[04:22:36] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: "he's asked those who asked him to ask us" :)
[04:22:38] <agcolom> Apparently things arrive on his desk....
[04:22:41] <toddmparker_> this is heilman?
[04:22:45] <agcolom> Yes
[04:22:48] <toddmparker_> yeah, i get it.
[04:22:53] <toddmparker_> he's a nice guy
[04:23:04] <toddmparker_> ok, carry on
[04:23:05] <agcolom> he is and his office is 20mins walk from mine!
[04:23:15] <toddmparker_> it's early, back to playing legos with my son for a bit
[04:23:16] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Nice!
[04:23:20] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: about the gradient... there was a rule already that said ui-popup-container .ui-content background-image none
[04:23:30] <agcolom> Excellent! (lego)
[04:23:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: that was because of that 1px image for the border I think but it also removes the background gradient
[04:25:01] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I'll remove that rule, because that image is solved with the > in the selector

[04:30:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (custom CSS): welcome back popup background gradients. - Jasper de Groot
[04:34:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: has it been considered to use window.screen.availHeight / Width for the popup widget?
[05:14:13] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: great. nice fix.
[05:54:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is there a platform where it would make the popup behave correctly?
[05:55:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't want to modify the existing code unless its imperfect in some situations.
[05:56:04] <_|Nix|_> s/its/it's/
[06:25:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was just curious if it was considered or tested... not saying we should change it to use that
[06:26:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: reason I ask is because I noticed on FF that min-height set for the page (not popup) was off, while availHeight gave me the correct height
[06:28:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Some of these values might already be incorporated into jQuery's $( window ).width() and $( window ).height() methods.
[06:29:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I found that I had to use window.innerHeight || $( window ).height() because it was breaking on iOS if I didn't do it that way. Check out http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6724
[06:30:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: _|Nix|_ yeah I saw that ticket
[06:31:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was expecting jQuery's height() to return the available width... not sure why it was off on FF, while it was correct on Chrome
[06:37:06] <uGoMobi> available height*
[07:37:08] <toddparker> morning (again)
[07:45:35] <toddparker> popups are looking really good
[07:45:39] <toddparker> the api feels great
[07:45:44] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Excellent!
[07:45:56] <toddparker> thanks for all your work on these _|Nix|_
[07:46:08] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: NP - it's been fun!
[07:46:19] <toddparker> yeah
[07:46:33] <toddparker> you gotta prototype a lot to get things right
[07:46:45] <toddparker> especially something like this that will be used lots of different ways
[07:46:56] <toddparker> feels powerful but easy to use
[07:47:00] <toddparker> which is hard to do
[07:47:25] <toddparker> one thing that still bugs me is the way the page scrolls back to the origin when you close a popup
[07:47:49] <toddparker> do we need to scroll?
[07:48:04] <toddparker> i know we need to return focus, but the scrolling is freaky
[07:48:28] <toddparker> common use case: you open a popup w/o an overlay, then decide to ignore it and scroll down the page
[07:48:33] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Returning the focus causes the scrolling.
[07:48:44] <toddparker> when you try tapping the page, it zooms you back up
[07:49:02] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Well, I can, you know, ... /not/ return the focus ...
[07:49:11] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... but custom select does it that way.
[07:49:24] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: It returns focus to the button that launched it.
[07:49:31] <toddparker> for accessibility it think we need to
[07:51:02] <toddparker> the focus is tricky
[07:51:31] <toddparker> what if we only returned focus if keyboard contras were used
[07:52:18] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Well, we place the focus onto the popup when the user launches it, so when it closes, it would take the focus with.
[07:52:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, we need to return focus when it closes.
[07:52:48] <toddparker> so she would focus go when closed?
[07:52:51] <toddparker> right
[07:52:59] <toddparker> the scroll is killer
[07:53:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I actually find it useful.
[07:53:23] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: If I'm testing all the real-world popup examples
[07:53:30] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I want to click on the next example.
[07:53:59] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: But sometimes, as a result of all my orientation changes while testing one example, I end up in a completely different spot on the page.
[07:54:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, it's refreshing not to have to find the real-world examples again, but to have the browser jump back to them instead.
[07:54:58] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... but, of course, that's only because all the real world examples are in close proximity.
[07:56:00] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there a strong push towards having app pages that fit within the window? I mean, aside from long lists ...
[07:56:49] <toddparker> seems like pages will always scroll
[07:57:10] <toddparker> let's not worry about this now, just wanted to mention it
[07:57:31] <toddparker> the pro is that you at least understand why your tap didn't register (you closed the popup)
[08:00:04] <toddparker> we may be able to do something later like
[08:00:20] <toddparker> if you scroll the popup out of view by X tolerance, we auto-close it
[08:00:35] <toddparker> and if you scroll while the popup is open, we nix the focus behavior
[08:19:45] <toddparker> or, only refocus if the element is still visible in the viewport?
[08:19:51] <toddparker> anyway, food for thought
[08:28:15] <gseguin> Hi all
[08:28:26] <gseguin> sorry for going MIA on you yesterday
[08:28:41] <gseguin> it was crazy town with the moving in
[08:28:53] <gseguin> I'm finally set up in the office here
[08:29:17] <gseguin> I'm going to start looking into the issues assigned to me right NAO!
[09:06:16] <tbenzige> toddparker: ping
[09:10:33] <gseguin> johnbender: ping
[09:17:54] <gseguin> someone removed the index.html in the tests/unit directory, how do you run all suites locally?
[09:18:36] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You need to install phantomjs and then run JUNIT_OUTPUT=build/test-results/ ROOT_DOMAIN=$WEB_SERVER grunt test
[09:18:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Where $WEB_SERVER is the base URL for jquery-mobile
[09:19:00] <gseguin> ah ah! I was missing the ROOT_DOMAIN one
[09:19:03] <gseguin> thank you _|Nix|_
[09:19:10] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: NP.
[09:19:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Don't forget the http://
[09:20:02] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: This doesn't work for me. The tests keep timing out.
[09:20:19] <gseguin> works same
[09:20:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It's an ongoing problem for both uGoMobi and I.
[09:20:30] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: What do you mean "works same"?
[09:20:39] <johnbender> gseguin: pong
[09:20:39] <gseguin> button test is timing out
[09:20:52] <gseguin> ah... testman is here
[09:20:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah ... *nod*
[09:21:11] <_|Nix|_> Na na na na na na na testman!
[09:21:23] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm having trouble running the tests
[09:21:33] <gseguin> what am I doing wrong?
[09:21:33] <johnbender> gseguin: what are you working on?
[09:21:36] <johnbender> gseguin: nothing
[09:21:55] <johnbender> the issue is that the qunit script that gets injected by grunt comes to slow/late some times
[09:21:56] <gseguin> I upgraded to jQuery 1.7.2
[09:22:03] <johnbender> so the tests finish before the callbacks can be establisehd
[09:22:13] <gseguin> can we fix that ?
[09:22:31] <gseguin> next I was going to look at the listview issues that are assigned to me
[09:22:36] <johnbender> gseguin: I tried with nix doing a timeout
[09:22:47] <johnbender> but that didn't seem to work too well
[09:22:56] <gseguin> but first I was trying to test
[09:23:12] <johnbender> gseguin: run nav locally
[09:23:14] <johnbender> and then push
[09:23:22] <johnbender> it's something I still need to sort out
[09:23:33] <gseguin> awight!
[09:23:41] <johnbender> gseguin: can I make a request before the listview stuff?
[09:24:02] <gseguin> yeah like an IRQ ?
[09:24:16] <johnbender> gseguin: lol something like that
[09:24:21] <gseguin> :P
[09:24:25] <johnbender> gseguin: can you take a look at the plugin generation
[09:24:32] <johnbender> you know more about stripping out he meta data
[09:24:40] <gseguin> yeah, is it in master?
[09:24:45] <johnbender> gseguin: nope
[09:24:49] <johnbender> plugin-generation
[09:25:16] <johnbender> gseguin: I looked at the download builder but the regexps look like too much fun for me :D
[09:25:25] <johnbender> anyway I figured it would be quicker
[09:25:34] <gseguin> ok will do
[09:25:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/tZB0-g

[09:26:26] <johnbender> gseguin: thanks
[09:26:38] <johnbender> gseguin: feel free to refactor if you want
[09:26:43] <johnbender> that shit always feels clumsy
[09:26:46] <johnbender> :/
[09:26:57] <johnbender> I'm going to try and sort out the IE issues with testswarm
[09:27:12] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Ping!
[09:27:13] <johnbender> more issues with the query params it looks like :(
[09:27:15] <gseguin> nav tests passed locally
[09:27:21] <johnbender> gseguin: then push
[09:27:25] <gseguin> I pushed jquery.js is now 1.7.2
[09:27:44] <gseguin> well I thought I pushed
[09:27:51] <johnbender> gseguin: do we have 1.7.1 vendored in the tree?
[09:28:09] <gseguin> yeah as jquery-1.7.1.js
[09:28:13] <johnbender> kk
[09:28:21] <johnbender> one of these  days I'm going to replace that
[09:28:29] <johnbender> err
[09:28:30] <johnbender> move it
[09:28:44] <johnbender> having all those extranious files in there drives me nuts
[09:28:52] <aniasis> hello
[09:28:57] <johnbender> especially with the build stuff
[09:29:19] <uGoMobi> johnbender: what version of IE is testswarm testing against?
[09:29:26] <aniasis> I found a bug in the mobile code.  I don't know if it is documented
[09:29:34] <johnbender> uGoMobi: 9
[09:29:47] <aniasis> but it is a bug that was resolved in jquery 1.4 or so
[09:29:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: starting with the easy stuf
[09:29:58] <uGoMobi> aniasis: can you file an issue for that on GitHub?
[09:30:05] <gseguin> aniasis: can you file an issue on github?
[09:30:19] <aniasis> ok
[09:30:24] <johnbender> aniasis: can you tell we like to use github issues?
[09:30:29] <johnbender> arg
[09:30:31] <gseguin> thank you aniasis
[09:30:33] <gseguin> :)
[09:30:35] <johnbender> didn't get it in there fast enough :D
[09:30:39] <johnbender> aniasis: thanks for reporting it
[09:30:41] <aniasis> what about a workaround if anyone is aware?
[09:30:42] <uGoMobi> :)
[09:30:51] <aniasis> of the issue
[09:32:17] <aniasis> it is dealing with loading jQuerymobile in a hidden iframe
[09:33:13] <uGoMobi> aniasis: did you already search for related issues ?
[09:33:35] <uGoMobi> aniasis: I know there have been reported a few iframe issues before
[09:34:15] <uGoMobi> if it is not yet reported, please open a new ticket and include a test page
[09:35:52] <aniasis> ok
[09:36:02] <uGoMobi> thanks!

[09:45:59] <_|Nix|_> My fault ^
[09:46:04] <_|Nix|_> Looking at it ...
[09:49:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'd let it run again
[09:49:28] <johnbender> it's the nav tests which gseguin just ran
[09:49:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The commit listed is mine, but OK.
[09:50:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nav tests passed for me in local Chrome.
[09:50:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Does it run the push-state-disabled-tests as well when you open tests/unit/navigation?
[09:50:36] <johnbender> no
[09:50:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you can try running that directly
[09:50:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[10:01:02] <gseguin> my push didn't go through
[10:01:17] <gseguin> I had a little argument with git
[10:02:29] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... the test ran on my push :)

[10:03:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Upgrade master to 1.7.2 - Fixes #4631 - Ghislain Seguin
[10:03:57] <toddparker> everyone: pong
[10:04:54] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Where would a ui-popup-active class go? (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4503) The popup div? The container div?
[10:04:54] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4503 on jquery-mobile (frequent; 1m, 2w ago): ui-popup-active class for popups?
[10:06:52] <toddparker> so the active class is just there for folks, we're not using it for styling
[10:06:54] <toddparker> right?
[10:07:02] <toddparker> if so, i'd add it to the container
[10:07:16] <toddparker> no worries gseguin
[10:07:26] <toddparker> uGoMobi: what do you think?
[10:07:42] <toddparker> i need to post up an agenda, huh?
[10:07:59] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK.
[10:09:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: toddparker : +1 for active class on container
[10:09:37] <_|Nix|_> Great ... all nav tests pass for me locally :-S
[10:09:55] <toddparker> if we tuck it onto the payload, it's harder to target UP to the container
[10:10:03] <toddparker> so let's go for it
[10:10:17] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Will do.
[10:10:42] <toddparker> commented
[10:11:07] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Beat ya to it :) Now they're both there for posterity ;)
[10:12:03] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Bugzilla has this feature where it gives you a bug fat warning: "Mid-air collision detected!" if two people comment concurrently :) Not so with github.

[10:27:24] <toddparker> cool
[10:28:32] <johnbender> gseguin: queued a build with 1.7.2
[10:28:51] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Do we have an agenda?
[10:31:10] <gseguin> johnbender: shouldn't it be default?
[10:31:14] <toddparker> agenda - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gDVpFYo5q5MV7aI0d5qTYNLvSxbVBX_fFEpehKmedKw/edit#
[10:31:22] * _|Nix|_ pounces
[10:31:28] <toddparker> 1.7.2 should be the default
[10:31:38] <toddparker> as soon as 1.8 is final, that should be
[10:31:47] <toddparker> have we tested with 1.8rc yet?
[10:32:01] <gseguin> since jquery.js is 1.7.2. now
[10:32:20] <gseguin> nope we haven't
[10:32:30] <johnbender> gseguin: it is locally
[10:32:37] <gseguin> when is .live()
[10:32:41] <gseguin> going away?
[10:33:09] <johnbender> but when you specify a version(s) of jquery to use with the build it's restricted
[10:33:17] <johnbender> gseguin: so we have to explicit
[10:33:25] <johnbender> again, locally it'll just default
[10:33:26] <gseguin> oh ok
[10:34:01] <johnbender> before we support another version I'll break that out into an "end of the day" test like the UI folks do
[10:34:10] <johnbender> maybe I'll do that today

[10:46:30] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4755 on jquery-mobile (toddparker; 6m, 40s ago): Collapsible and set: add expand and collapse methods
[10:49:40] <toddparker> uGoMobi: other things like that need docs?
[10:49:57] <toddparker> johnbender: cool
[10:50:14] <uGoMobi> toddparker: collapsible not all options are in the docs
[10:50:20] <toddparker> yeah?
[10:50:25] <toddparker> let's jam on that today
[10:50:31] <uGoMobi> sorry.... collapsible SET
[10:50:32] <toddparker> they should be in for 1.2
[10:50:35] <toddparker> gotcha
[10:50:45] <toddparker> also for 1.1.2?
[10:51:02] <uGoMobi> yes
[10:51:10] <toddparker> maybe agcolom can help too
[10:51:48] <uGoMobi> yes, it's mostly copy paste from collapsible
[10:51:56] <uGoMobi> same options
[10:53:05] <agcolom> yes, what can i do?
[10:54:36] <toddparker> we need to document the expand/collapse methods for collapsible and sets
[10:54:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: question for you
[10:54:56] <agcolom> sure
[10:55:03] <toddparker> collapsible has no method documented
[10:55:11] <toddparker> set has refresh
[10:55:18] <toddparker> should individual ones too?
[10:55:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you took out the double click prevention in the dialog, but it looks like the test for it is still there
[10:55:37] <toddparker> agcolom can check the scripts to see if we missed anything else
[10:55:59] <toddparker> agcolom: you can close this too https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4755#issuecomment-7284938

[10:57:02] <agcolom> sure, will do.
[10:57:20] <agcolom> do we have our weekly meeting in 3 minutes?
[10:59:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I don't remember anymore. There was a bug about clicking the close button twice in quick succession. The test tests exactly that - right? *scratch head*

[11:02:17] <gseguin> johnbender: .readFileSync()... , you really are not embracing asynchronity ;)

[11:03:08] <gseguin> :)
[11:03:10] <johnbender> s/fuck/eff/
[11:06:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes, but the change was removed
[11:06:24] <johnbender> the test wasn't
[11:06:29] <johnbender> it's breaking in IE which is why I ask
[11:07:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Sorry ... I'm all cobwebs on this one ...
[11:07:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Which change was removed?
[11:09:24] <johnbender> fa1d511ca8c0cdffba832b1697e537b8462d8d90
[11:09:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ^
[11:10:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Looking ...
[11:11:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's the code that adds double-click prevention. The test attempts to double-click, right?
[11:13:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: IIRC, before the above change, a double-click would result in a double-window.history.back() ...
[11:13:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, this code prevents that, and the test makes sure that a double-window.history.back() does not happen, ... IIRC.
[11:13:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Do you happen to have a commitid for the test?
[11:16:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: fdee13f8796a44e6a58d86753f3dd47b36960511
[11:16:58] <johnbender> that's the revert
[11:18:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: one sec, I'll get the test commit
[11:18:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: 5339f7da08475c39781b120af0cdf372cd712d67
[11:20:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I re-implemented the double-click prevention here: 6a458153
[11:20:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So the test is still relevant.
[11:21:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I realized that it's not the click that needs to be prevented, but the double-call to close().
[11:22:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... whether that happen via multiple clicks or via multiple programmatic close() calls.
[11:24:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah, right you are
[11:25:02] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:26:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: looks like a timing issue, the pagehide is firing before the timedout click in ie
[11:27:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no transitions I expect
[11:27:34] <johnbender> makes the page hide instant
[11:32:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can we move the reset of  that variable to the pagebeforeshow?
[11:35:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Let's find out :)
[11:37:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Like this? https://gist.github.com/3183692
[11:39:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: there's already a pagebeforeshow binding
[11:39:30] <johnbender> I'm going to give it a whirl
[11:39:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, OK. By all means, then.

[12:09:59] <johnbender> toddparker: fixed
[12:10:07] <toddparker> thanks johnbender!
[12:10:13] <johnbender> -s for the loss
[12:10:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: When you open them?
[12:10:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ???? -s?
[12:11:15] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: i swear, every popup opens over the paragraph above the real world demos,  no matter where they are

[12:13:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ^^
[12:13:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: +1
[12:14:09] <uGoMobi> johnbender: is changing the file names work in progress? because http://jquerymobile.com/test/ is broken
[12:14:46] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that I'm not sure about
[12:14:57] <johnbender> I thought that was directly related to latest
[12:14:59] <johnbender> let me look
[12:15:00] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, it's still good on iPod ...
[12:15:11] <uGoMobi> johnbender: it now points to js/jquery.mobile-1.2.0-pre.js
[12:15:12] <toddparker> WAT
[12:15:17] <uGoMobi> 404
[12:15:22] <toddparker> so nobody can reproduce this?
[12:15:47] <toddparker> johnbender: /test/ still seems broken
[12:16:10] <toddparker> uGoMobi: latest and /test/ are different animals, right johnbender
[12:16:23] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes
[12:16:32] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i get an unstyled page on test
[12:16:36] <toddparker> you see a 404?
[12:16:40] <tbenzige> toddparker: ping
[12:16:46] <toddparker> hey tbenzige
[12:16:57] <tbenzige> hey there. just pushed my blogpost live
[12:16:58] <tbenzige> http://tybenz.com/post/themebot/
[12:17:01] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I see a unstyled page as well... the JS and CSS files return 404
[12:17:13] <uGoMobi>  js/jquery.mobile-1.2.0-pre.js
[12:17:20] <johnbender> toddparker: nope they are related
[12:17:29] <uGoMobi> the suffix 1.2.0-pre is added
[12:18:27] <uGoMobi> johnbender: but /test/ is branch preview right?
[12:18:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll try to make a version that has lots of console.log statements and have you run it from my server. I have a php js console hack in place ...
[12:18:36] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ^
[12:18:37] <johnbender> uGoMobi: unless that changed
[12:18:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Sorry ...
[12:18:51] <johnbender> maybe I missed somethign
[12:19:13] <johnbender> gnarf: you around?
[12:19:25] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: you don't see that issue with positioning? just cjhecking
[12:19:33] <johnbender> uGoMobi: what did gnarf say?
[12:19:58] <uGoMobi> johnbender: about what exactly?
[12:20:13] <johnbender> uGoMobi: about those changes
[12:20:23] <johnbender> I know you guys were around when there were issues
[12:20:34] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Nope. iPod is a-OK.
[12:21:07] <uGoMobi> yes, but I don't think he made changes to what build is used
[12:21:27] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah then it should still be pointing at the latest demos dir
[12:22:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: confirmed
[12:22:54] <johnbender> something's been mucked up with the build
[12:23:07] <uGoMobi> johnbender: gnarf only fixed the path
[12:23:23] <uGoMobi> johnbender: it was pointing to js/ instead of ../../js/
[12:23:36] <johnbender> uGoMobi: eh?
[12:23:46] <johnbender> uGoMobi: what do you mean
[12:23:49] <uGoMobi> but now it points to ../../jquery.mobile-1.2.0-pre.js
[12:24:00] <uGoMobi> that file name wasn't there
[12:24:16] <uGoMobi> because it loads a php file right?

[12:25:04] <gseguin> argh! Dammit bot-t!
[12:25:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: lol not so sure right now
[12:25:28] <uGoMobi> johnbender: view-source:http://jquerymobile.com/test/
[12:25:47] <uGoMobi> johnbender: that use to point to a directory, not a filename
[12:25:51] <uGoMobi> correct?
[12:26:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: correct
[12:26:12] <uGoMobi> the JS and CSS source in there I mean
[12:26:14] <gseguin> if it points to a file that means it's built
[12:26:19] <johnbender> uGoMobi: sorry
[12:26:24] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I believe that's correct
[12:26:25] <johnbender> i don't recall
[12:26:32] <johnbender> we didn't change the build recently though
[12:26:49] <johnbender> uGoMobi: more likely it has always pointed to the file
[12:27:38] <uGoMobi> well since latest is not updating I grab the url's from the docs source code many times a day
[12:28:02] <uGoMobi> and I never saw a file name with the 1.2.0-pre suffix until now
[12:28:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: correct
[12:28:11] <johnbender> the suffix is wrong
[12:28:19] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that's the issue
[12:28:24] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:28:29] <johnbender> it has, for a while at least referenced a file directly
[12:28:33] <johnbender> not js/
[12:28:56] <johnbender> uGoMobi: Ah!
[12:28:59] <johnbender> I know what it is
[12:29:03] <johnbender> that damn test
[12:29:04] <uGoMobi> ok, maybe the source file on github is pointing to the directory?
[12:29:09] <johnbender> alright

[12:37:13] <johnbender> gseguin: awesome

[12:46:32] <gseguin> oh man!... ok I will
[12:46:53] <johnbender> gseguin: luckily it's a fairly proper unit test

[12:50:41] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: ah, so you see it?
[12:51:52] <agcolom> toddparker: Just checked with Chris. They'd like a statement saying that we support Firefox for Andoid (not desktop). No details on the statement yet.
[12:51:53] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I started seeing it after I turned on debug console.
[12:52:21] <toddparker> tell him we want a book to gecko phone :)
[12:52:28] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: odd
[12:52:34] <toddparker> i see it without

[12:54:59] <Wilto> DAMMIT, GSEGUIN
[12:55:12] <agcolom> toddparker: message sent ;-) waiting for reply ;-)
[12:55:17] <Wilto> (I just wanted dibs on saying it.)
[12:55:29] <Wilto> —aw, DAMMIT JOHNBENDER
[12:55:35] <gseguin> YES! I won a Wilto's dammit
[12:55:56] <Wilto> Guys, turns out `git bisect` is the _truth_.
[12:56:19] <toddparker> DAMMIT Ghislain
[12:56:20] <johnbender> gseguin: fixed with a quick check against the undefined for value
[12:56:30] <johnbender> gseguin: also, using apply is bad
[12:56:30] <Wilto> WE ARE ALL SO MAD AT YOU GSEGUIN
[12:56:41] <johnbender> I've realized that recently where perf is concerned
[12:56:46] <johnbender> and we use data attrs everywhere
[12:57:06] <toddparker> don't you speak ill of data attributes johnbender
[12:57:43] <toddparker> data-zip-it="true"
[12:57:47] <agcolom> toddparker: he can't promise one, but he'll see what he can do ;-)
[12:57:48] <johnbender> toddparker: no, I'm speaking ill of Function.prototype.apply and Function.prototype.call
[12:57:52] <Wilto> todd will flip out on you
[12:57:57] <toddparker> ok, better
[12:57:57] <johnbender> they are many orders of magnitude slower that regular function calls
[12:58:08] <toddparker> that's a lot
[12:58:17] <Wilto> I suggested using a class once for CSS, instead of a data attribute? BIG MISTAKE.
[12:58:27] <toddparker> i can't wait for you to go perf crazy on mobile
[12:58:31] <Wilto> apply is? I’m learning a lot today.
[12:58:50] <johnbender> Wilto: yah, they've optimized the _shiat_ out of function invocation
[12:58:59] <gseguin> Wilto: .apply in JavaScript
[13:00:22] * gseguin is tired and should read more of what people say
[13:00:50] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: does $.fn.data set undefined as a value or return the value of the data key?
[13:01:25] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: $("div").data( "foo", undefined ) => value associated with key "foo" ??
[13:01:26] <gseguin> johnbender: so you're on it, then?
[13:01:31] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[13:01:34] <johnbender> just verifying
[13:01:38] <gseguin> k
[13:02:12] <toddparker> gseguin: just catching up. did the switch to 1.7.2 cause this then?
[13:02:17] <johnbender> toddparker: yes
[13:02:19] <gseguin> yes
[13:02:20] <johnbender> just one failure it seems
[13:02:33] <toddparker> DAMMIT DaveMethvin
[13:03:35] <Wilto> I’m not angry with all of you. Just disappointed.
[13:04:19] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm going to push this change because it passes the tests but we should double check with DaveMethvin
[13:04:22] <johnbender> gseguin: help me remember
[13:04:53] <gseguin> Will do
[13:05:09] <Wilto> No psych I’m actually angry.

[13:30:09] <toddparker> so johnbender landed this fix: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/11ad07dd81ecdba608c32e8831300baf60f35776
[13:30:10] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by John Bender (24m, 39s ago): correct jqmData behavior to match our tests
[13:30:23] <toddparker> but the popups are still acting very odd
[13:30:57] <Wilto> Yeah, still busted for me.
[13:31:10] <gnarf> toddparker: do you know if your build is working/
[13:31:21] <gnarf> or if there is still a problem to hunt down?
[13:32:12] <Wilto> Hm. Looking now, I’m not sure that fix was related.
[13:36:07] <gseguin> johnbender: looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4721

[13:36:40] <gseguin> callback or triggering a custom event?
[13:37:26] <toddparker> gseguin: what do you think is the better way to go
[13:37:43] <toddparker> yeah gnarf, i think there is a different issue with popups
[13:37:51] <toddparker> we'll keep digging.
[13:38:09] <gseguin> custom event makes it easier to have several handlers but is that needed here
[13:39:29] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[13:40:06] <Wilto> …who renamed Jenkins.
[13:40:18] <gseguin> and there is a precedence in that code of callback via the options so we may want to stay consistent
[13:41:07] <agcolom> uGoMobi: what is the correct syntax to expand a collapsible?
[13:41:12] <agcolom> (for the docs)
[13:41:44] <gnarf> Wilto: i did
[13:41:57] <Wilto> gnarf: <3
[13:42:53] <gnarf> Wilto: i-hate-dave finally gave dave a green build
[13:43:00] <gnarf> so i figured it was time to change his name
[13:43:17] <Wilto> He earned it, that scrappy little robot.
[13:44:22] <agcolom> uGoMobi: toddparker: can I check one inconsistency with you?
[13:45:47] <agcolom> the docs say: enable - enable a disabled slider
[13:46:09] <agcolom> and disable - disable a slider
[13:47:18] <Wilto> Hey Corebros, you come across anything in 1.7.2 that would throw off the calculation of coordinates on a page?
[13:47:29] <Wilto> gnarf, DaveMethvin? ^
[13:48:46] <DaveMethvin> Wilto: 1.7.2? that was ages ago in code years
[13:48:51] <gnarf> Wilto: like .offset / .position?
[13:48:53] <toddparker> heh
[13:49:01] <gnarf> Wilto: only strange shit in IE8 ;)
[13:49:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:49:09] <Wilto> DaveMethvin: I prefer “classic.”
[13:49:12] <toddparker> when we switch from 1.7.1 to .2 things go wonky
[13:49:16] <Wilto> Aged, like a fine wine. Distinguished.
[13:49:23] <DaveMethvin> there is a bug in iOS we can't work around as i recall
[13:49:29] <toddparker> this is in iPads (not iPhones) other android tablets
[13:49:32] <Wilto> The Burt Reynolds of jQuery AH HAH

[13:52:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: $( ".selector" ).trigger( "expand" );
[13:52:45] <agcolom> or expand expand an expanded collapsible

[13:56:39] <Wilto> uGoMobi: `.trigger( "collapse" );`
[13:56:40] <agcolom> uGoMobi: OO is that short for something?
[13:56:50] <uGoMobi> Wilto: haha
[13:56:57] <DaveMethvin> ಠ_ಠ
[13:57:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that were my eyes
[13:57:21] <Wilto> don’t you judge me davemethvin
[13:57:26] <agcolom> ah ;-) sorry I thought it was an acronym I didn't know ;-) that is so funny!!!!
[13:58:03] <agcolom> so everywhere we have enable, it says enable a disable xxxx
[13:58:12] <agcolom> disabled ^
[13:58:13] <uGoMobi> I am not as good with special characters as DaveMethvin
[13:58:27] <DaveMethvin> ಧ
[13:58:54] <agcolom> I need to go on training for american words, acronyms and special characters!
[13:59:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we could leave that out
[13:59:27] <agcolom> euh... leave what out?
[13:59:32] <uGoMobi> I hope devs understand that something needs to be disabled before you can enable it
[14:00:24] <uGoMobi> if not, we can change the other one.... disable - disable an enabled slider
[14:00:43] <agcolom> well, I don't mind... I think you can disable whatever and if it is already disabled, it won't change...
[14:00:46] <uGoMobi> it sound a bit like ... open a closed door
[14:00:56] <agcolom> yes!
[14:01:08] <uGoMobi> as if you would open a door that is already open
[14:01:16] <uGoMobi> hang on... late dinner is ready
[14:01:31] <agcolom> ok.
[14:01:46] <tbenzige> toddparker: thanks for the RT
[14:01:54] <tbenzige> and the great feedback
[14:01:55] <agcolom> so ok for collapse collapse a collasible?
[14:02:27] <agcolom> uGoMobi: have a nice dinner!
[14:02:31] <tbenzige> johnbender: i was thinking of offering LESS/SASS configurations as an option
[14:02:34] <uGoMobi> thanks
[14:02:39] <agcolom> that's late! 11pm!?
[14:02:46] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: You’re not still floating around in here, are you?
[14:02:46] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:02:56] <tbenzige> johnbender: but i will probably do some good ol' fashioned parsing for regular CSS as well
[14:03:25] <uGoMobi> it mediterranean weather... so mediterraneanlifestyle as well
[14:03:42] <uGoMobi> its*
[14:03:52] <agcolom> excellent! So I'll put the 2 methods for collapsibles in now.
[14:03:53] <uGoMobi> should try to type while eating
[14:04:11] <agcolom> no! Switch off while eating ;-)
[14:04:13] <uGoMobi> shouldn't*
[14:04:16] <uGoMobi> see
[14:04:23] <uGoMobi> nah, not today
[14:04:31] <agcolom> ok ;-)
[14:05:51] <Wilto> Eesh, this is a fun one…
[14:06:51] <uGoMobi> Wilto: how long are you keeping us waiting?
[14:07:02] <Wilto> I like to build suspense.
[14:07:16] <uGoMobi> yeah I noticed ;)
[14:07:25] <Wilto> No, just tracking down this positioning thing on the popups, as of the 1.7.2 update.
[14:07:34] <uGoMobi> kk

[14:11:12] <agcolom> uGoMobi: is that ok?
[14:11:21] <agcolom> and should I cherry-pick?
[14:12:02] <agcolom> (just to clarify, I need 2 answers to avoid confusion ;-) ) a 1 letter for each is ok ;-)
[14:13:32] <uGoMobi> agcolom: now I am confused :)
[14:13:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the commit is fine
[14:13:46] <uGoMobi> thanks
[14:14:04] <uGoMobi> agcolom: about cherry-picking... have to double check
[14:14:14] <agcolom> ok, thx :-)
[14:14:26] <uGoMobi> but I suppose this is in 1.1-stable as well
[14:14:59] <uGoMobi> yup
[14:15:10] <agcolom> ok, so I cherry pick?
[14:15:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, you can cherry-pick in 1.1-stable
[14:15:17] <agcolom> ok, thx :-)

[14:18:20] <agcolom> done :-)
[14:33:58] <toddparker> i think picking these over is fine agcolom
[14:34:09] <toddparker> it's in 1.1.1 I believe
[14:34:20] <uGoMobi> toddparker: it is, I checked
[14:34:24] <agcolom> yes, that's also what uGoMobi said
[14:34:26] <toddparker> thanks uGoMobi
[14:34:40] <agcolom> so I did cherry pick and it's also now in the api docs.
[14:34:40] <toddparker> today is just one of those wacky days. fire everywhere
[14:34:41] <uGoMobi> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4735 I want to close that one
[14:34:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4735 on jquery-mobile (tempelton; 2d, 8h ago): cloning collapsibles doesn't work -fiddle
[14:35:20] <toddparker> looking
[14:35:22] <agcolom> toddparker: Chris loves that FF logo on the popup ;-)
[14:35:28] <toddparker> cool
[14:35:39] <toddparker> it was the easiest example
[14:35:59] <agcolom> indeed ;-) but may help you get a boot2gecko phone ;-)
[14:36:11] <toddparker> agcolom: we should add those methods to sets too, right?
[14:36:23] <toddparker> free FF advertising
[14:36:34] <toddparker> tell him we'll switch to chrome if our demands aren't met
[14:36:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: if no boot2gecko phone the popup example will be change to your frog
[14:36:49] <agcolom> uGoMobi: is it the same for sets?
[14:36:54] <agcolom> yes!!!!
[14:37:00] <agcolom> my green frog!!!!
[14:37:26] <uGoMobi> agcolom: well the selector needs to be one collapsible in the set
[14:38:06] <uGoMobi> toddparker: what do you think? list the methods there or only refer to methods of collapsible
[14:38:20] <agcolom> ok
[14:39:15] <agcolom> users.cscs.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jqm/javascriptevent.html
[14:39:35] <uGoMobi> toddparker: about that issue 4735... that is just something you can't do with an enhanced widget if you ask me
[14:40:14] <uGoMobi> maybe with some simple widgets
[14:47:17] <toddparker> sorry uGoMobi - looking now.
[14:48:04] <toddparker> yeah, agreed
[14:48:26] <toddparker> Wilto: any good news?
[14:48:33] <Wilto> Some.
[14:48:42] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok, thanks
[14:48:57] <uGoMobi> toddparker: agcolom : can we close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4755 ?
[14:48:58] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4755 on jquery-mobile (toddparker; 4h, 9m ago): Collapsible and set: add expand and collapse methods to docs
[14:48:59] <Wilto> It’s iOS flipping out about height/width in terms of chrome — the debug console was causing that issue.
[14:49:21] <toddparker> hrm
[14:49:24] <Wilto> I have fix in, but it ain’t great.
[14:49:28] <toddparker> it was waaaay off in iPad tho
[14:49:36] <toddparker> like hundreds of pixels sometimes
[14:50:00] <agcolom> so if you want to programmatically expand a collapsible in a set, you can only apply it to an individual collapsible that belong to that set. so possibly expand should only go in collapsible?
[14:50:03] <toddparker> so was there a 1.7.2 change that caused this?
[14:50:49] <toddparker> uGoMobi: yes. can we link to the doc page and commit?
[14:50:52] <agcolom> however, I can see how collapse could work on a set (but I don't know if it does) where it could collapse all the collapsibles in the set...
[14:50:55] <Wilto> I think I got it sorted, but I’m gonna wait until I can thoroughly test tomorrow.
[14:51:11] <toddparker> agcolom: so it's just the same as an individual? call collapse
[14:51:22] <agcolom> yes
[14:51:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think the method shouldn't be listed at collapsible set because you can't trigger it on the set
[14:51:38] <agcolom> can you trigger collapse on the set?
[14:51:42] <uGoMobi> no
[14:51:47] <toddparker> not on the set, but the one you want
[14:51:51] <uGoMobi> only on a collapsible
[14:52:07] <toddparker> could we just make that distinction clear?
[14:52:12] <agcolom> ok. Would it be useful to add it to the set (only collapse)
[14:52:13] <agcolom> ?
[14:52:30] <toddparker> i think so
[14:53:06] <agcolom> so you could collapse all the collapsibles in the set regardless of which one was open....
[14:53:13] <Wilto> toddparker: Yeah; it’s a combination of the browser chrome (passable), and the dev console.
[14:53:16] <agcolom> Would that be hard to add?
[14:53:43] <uGoMobi> is you list $("#selector").trigger("expand") as method for collapsible set, it gives the impression that "#selector" is the set
[14:53:48] <toddparker> i see where you're going agcolom
[14:54:00] <uGoMobi> is = if
[14:54:09] <Wilto> But as you know, toddparker: http://tripleodeon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/table.html
[14:54:15] <Wilto> So, I wanna tread carefully.
[14:54:26] <toddparker> i know. it's a mess Wilto
[14:54:37] <Wilto> I know we’re adjusting for this elsewhere based on orientation thanks to Kin’s work, so I think this can be solved.
[14:54:39] <toddparker> one option is to just add a message
[14:55:06] <Wilto> But not until I got a million of the test devices in front of me.
[14:55:44] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I agree.
[14:55:50] <toddparker> The collapsible set plugin doesn't have any public methods. To expand or collapse items in a set, call the respective methods on individual collapsibles.
[14:56:01] <toddparker> and just link over
[14:56:05] <agcolom> toddparker: excellent!
[14:56:24] <toddparker> adding the ability to collapse the set is a nice idea for later
[14:56:41] <toddparker> CASE CLOASED
[14:56:59] <agcolom> yes... Makes things easier for devs. How will we remember?
[14:57:13] <agcolom> open an issue?
[14:57:31] <Wilto> ?cc
[14:57:31] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[14:57:44] <Wilto> Missed you, bot-t.
[14:59:33] <agcolom> toddparker: Actually in the docs the collapsible set plugin has got one public methods: refresh
[14:59:59] <Wilto> Headed out. Gonna throw this fix to the interns tomorrow for testing, and get it committed ASAP.
[15:00:18] <uGoMobi> goodnight Wilto
[15:00:26] <Wilto> Later, guys!
[15:01:57] <agcolom> later Wilto... and how's your sweet little boy doing?

[15:38:02] <uGoMobi> johnbender: that's IE10 which we don't support yet...

[15:39:59] <uGoMobi> johnbender: since you were working on the IE issues
