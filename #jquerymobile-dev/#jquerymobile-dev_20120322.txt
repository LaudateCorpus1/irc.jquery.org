[07:22:44] <Wilto> Whatup, Team jQM.
[07:24:34] <Wilto> “FAILURE,” you say.
[07:26:44] <Wilto> “jQuery Mobros” would’ve been much better than “Team jQM.”
[07:32:59] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!

[10:10:35] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from scottjehl: nighttime at the fort, Jodhpur   http://t.co/NquuNg2X ★ http://bit.ly/GGCcVF
[10:10:55] <Wilto> I’m not jealous of scottjehl in the least, just for the record. _Not at all_.
[10:31:41] <gseguin> Wilto: for the builder: _.groupBy will do
[10:32:00] <gseguin> what was your intention with that? have like sections?
[10:48:28] <Wilto> Yeah. There’s metadata in a few of the JS files, for the sake of grouping. One sec…
[10:48:43] <Wilto> Like…
[10:49:02] <Wilto> jquery.mobile.core.js contains “//>>group: core”
[10:49:19] <Wilto> Each of the form widgets would contain “form”, etc.
[10:49:41] <Wilto> Barely started hacking around on that, so totally open to doing things differently.
[10:53:02] <gseguin> ok
[10:55:09] <Wilto> gseguin: As always: http://wil.to/_/noidea-science.jpeg
[10:55:20] <Wilto> Oh damn meeting time soon.
[10:55:55] <gseguin> :)
[10:56:20] <Wilto> Roll call. johnbender, kinblas; you guys around? toddparker is tied-up in a meeting, I think.
[10:56:20] <bot-t> (45 secs ago) <iros> tell wilto for your collection: http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1a5q4cS471qanb21o1_400.gif
[10:56:31] <Wilto> terrifying
[10:58:30] <gseguin> so, meeting? or not?
[10:59:07] <_|Nix|_> I /remembered/ the time difference this time *grin*
[10:59:23] <johnbender> nice
[10:59:33] <gseguin> heh :) but it seems like no one is available though
[10:59:58] <johnbender> gseguin: I am
[11:00:10] <johnbender> Wilto: is todd otherwise indisposed?
[11:00:23] <gseguin> ok, so let's start one then
[11:00:30] <johnbender> gseguin: not it
[11:00:34] <johnbender> :P
[11:00:39] <Wilto> Todd is, but I don’t think he’s gonna be long. He’ll probably join mid-meeting.
[11:00:45] <gseguin> https://plus.google.com/hangouts/9c6be0315b66729a8708fcf07fc49ef5a03f2f93
[11:00:53] <toddparker> thanks gseguin
[11:00:56] <Wilto> That slacker. Meetings are no excuse for being late to meetings.
[11:13:43] <gseguin> johnbender: you're echoing
[11:23:12] <kinblas> sorry guys skipping the meeting ... I'm prepping for a different one
[11:44:48] <johnbender> gseguin: sorry about that
[11:44:51] <johnbender> kinblas: slacker!
[11:44:53] <johnbender> :D
[11:45:07] <gseguin> johnbender: no worries
[12:10:16] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: toddparker: kinblas: _|Nix|_: new blerg post if you guys are interested http://johnbender.us/2012/03/22/a-natural-transformation-in-javascript/
[12:11:54] <Wilto> johnbender: oh man what is that equation oh god oh god
[12:12:14] <kinblas> lol
[12:12:22] * kinblas bookmarks
[12:20:16] <eddiemonge> johnbender: looks like it might be standing room only for your talk on tuesday
[12:21:07] <johnbender> eddiemonge: whoa crasy
[12:21:11] <johnbender> *crazy
[12:21:18] <johnbender> I assume we're meeting in a closet then :D
[12:21:39] <eddiemonge> i sent out an announcement to a few different javascript groups in the area and rsvps shot up overnight
[12:21:57] <johnbender> wow great
[12:21:59] <johnbender> thanks man!
[12:22:04] <johnbender> super excited
[12:22:10] <johnbender> off to lunch!

[14:07:22] <Wilto> You guys remember that time I broke the build? Good times.
[14:10:28] <eddiemonge> isnt that multiple times a day?
[14:10:37] <Wilto> SHH
[14:17:14] <Wilto> johnbender: I’ve got everything passing, here.
[14:17:34] <Wilto> johnbender: But http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/1115/ isn’t working. Any clues?
[14:17:46] <Wilto> (Or is that link working for someone else?)
[14:21:46] <johnbender> Wilto: it's inside our firewall
[14:21:59] <Wilto> Oh, oh.
[14:22:21] <johnbender> let me try locally
[14:22:34] <Wilto> I just had those events fail in Chrome, but that’s it.
[14:24:47] <johnbender> Wilto: lets see if it goes away with the hourly build
[14:33:31] <Wilto> Cool; I’ll keep an eye out.
[14:33:34] <johnbender> toddparker: working on that double transitions crazyness
[14:33:45] <johnbender> having to work to get xcode up to snuff etc
[14:33:49] <Wilto> How goes that, anyway? Able to reproduce it?
[14:33:50] <Wilto> Ah.
[14:56:44] <johnbender> Wilto: toddparker: ok I can reproduce the flash with the latest xcode and the ipad emulator
[14:56:50] <johnbender> it's very subtle though
[14:57:09] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[14:57:09] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #1,116: FIXED in 24 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/1116/
[14:57:15] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[14:58:51] <johnbender> also, the fixed header doesn't behave like a fixed header all the time
[14:58:54] <johnbender> it's quite odd
[15:01:38] <johnbender> nevermind that was an unclosed div in zip they linked
[15:02:51] <johnbender> double nevermind
[15:02:58] <johnbender> it does act totally bizarre town
[15:03:08] <johnbender> it actually hides when I try to click it in the emulator

[16:59:06] <gseguin> Wilto: toddparker is there a repo for the builder?
[17:16:29] <Wilto> gseguin: Nope, not yet.
[17:16:51] <Wilto> Don’t think I have permission to add one under jQuery.
[17:17:02] <gseguin> same here
[17:17:20] <gseguin> do you have a repo for filamentgroup
[17:17:27] <gseguin> ?
[17:18:10] <Wilto> Naw. Should probably be under jquery anyway—I’ll hit someone up real quick.
