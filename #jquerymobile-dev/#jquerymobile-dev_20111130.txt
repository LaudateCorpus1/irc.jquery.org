[18:40:08] <toddmparker_> hey garann!
[18:40:16] <toddmparker_> you around?
[18:40:33] <garann> hello!
[18:40:34] <garann> yes
[18:41:39] <toddmparker_> oh hai
[18:42:13] <toddmparker_> i was just wondering if you had started tinkering with the position:fixed idea for the toolbars
[18:42:31] <toddmparker_> if you had Q's, etc.
[18:42:43] <garann> i haven't - i got distracted with this template thing for work
[18:42:47] <garann> but that's finally fixed
[18:42:59] <garann> so yes, first question: i actually don't know how to create a branch..
[18:43:30] <toddmparker_> ah
[18:43:39] <garann> i could figure it out, i'm sure, but i just wanted to know if it'll be fine if i create it locally
[18:43:41] <toddmparker_> sure there is a github tutorial
[18:43:49] <garann> yeah, i figured as much :)
[18:44:07] <toddmparker_> one option is to throw this into the branch wilto and i are using for experimental stuff
[18:44:21] <garann> didn't know if it needed to come from the upstream thing, or if i could add it to my own fork is all
[18:44:31] <toddmparker_> we're fooling around with popups, dialog re-factor and ajax includes in the dialog-refactor branch
[18:45:02] <garann> whatever is easiest works for me
[18:45:19] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[18:45:59] <toddmparker_> well, this probably isn't right, but i think throwing this into the branch we're working on may be fine, at least bow
[18:46:01] <toddmparker_> now
[18:46:13] <garann> ok cool
[18:46:20] <toddmparker_> sure will be easier to test all the new stuff in one place
[18:46:29] <garann> i will grab that one and start working on it
[18:46:32] <toddmparker_> guess we shoudl re-name the branch :)
[18:46:34] <toddmparker_> cool
[18:47:10] <toddmparker_> i think most of your changes will just be in the jquery.mobile.fixHeaderFooter.js file
[18:47:32] <toddmparker_> and the jquery.mobile.headerfooter.css file
[18:48:08] <toddmparker_> if this pans out, we can ask johnbender what the "right" way to track and merge this in.
[18:48:37] <toddmparker_> i'm not sure how well this will work, so i just want to have you patch this in so i can do some testing, then we'll decide what to do
[18:49:23] <toddmparker_> a few things to think about
[18:49:39] <garann> that sounds good
[18:49:51] <toddmparker_> 1. should we keep the current dynamic re-position in as a fallback or just fallback to inline
[18:58:18] <toddmparker_> 1b. if we keep this in, how to we target this mainly to iOS 3-4 since iOS5, Android 2.2+ support fixed
[18:58:24] <toddmparker_> test results here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Position:fixed-and-Overflow:-testing
[18:58:56] <toddmparker_> (think i'd prefer to fallback to inline)
[19:01:46] <toddmparker_> actually, wait on #2 :)
[19:02:01] <toddmparker_> let me know if you have Q's as you go garann!
[19:02:32] <garann> oh, cool, i didn't know there was a whole doc about it :)
[20:00:11] <toddmparker_> randome notes here on 1.next stuff i'm tracking
