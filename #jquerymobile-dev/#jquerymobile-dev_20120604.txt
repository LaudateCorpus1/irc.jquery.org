[10:45:36] <johnbender> whoa
[10:45:43] <johnbender> no alerts on jqm stuff this morning
[10:45:51] <johnbender> it's been nearly 12 hours since I checked
[10:45:59] <johnbender> is the whole east coast having a power outage
[10:46:04] <johnbender> and maybe europe too?
[10:56:01] <gseguin> there is a jseguin ?
[10:56:14] <gseguin> welcome jseguin!
[10:59:05] <deAtog> johnbender: I've seen a couple of issues, but I don't have time to investigate them
[11:07:21] <deAtog> johnbender: if you want to investigate: 1. popup flickers upon display (Android 2.3.5) 2. Unable to display dialog created in javascript via popup
[11:08:12] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: How exactly does it flicker? Does it appear completely, then it do the transition, then appear completely again?
[11:08:20] <_|Nix|_> s/it //
[11:08:23] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[11:08:31] <_|Nix|_> s/it do/do/
[11:09:05] <deAtog> _|Nix|_ I haven't had time to investigate.. but when it was first committed it didn't flicker.. it does now
[11:09:28] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: I made the animations interruptible - that may be causing the flicker.
[11:09:42] <deAtog> maybe
[11:10:08] <johnbender> jzaefferer: does grunt reset the config between tasks?
[11:10:12] <_|Nix|_> I'll check on my wonderfully underpowered n900
[11:10:15] <johnbender> I'm having a hard time getting modifications to persist
[11:10:32] <jzaefferer> johnbender: #grunt is a good place for questions like that
[11:10:39] * johnbender goes there
[11:11:42] <MauriceG_> Hi _|Nix|_!  May an configuration option for interruptible animations ?
[11:12:28] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG_: Nono ... that's not a user-thing ... animations need to be interuptible if the user navigates to another page while a popup is opening.
[11:12:52] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG_: ... or while a popup is closing.
[11:13:05] <MauriceG_> ok!
[11:13:47] <_|Nix|_> Dang! The N900 doesn't have transitions, so I can't really test the animation thing ...
[11:17:11] <deAtog> _|Nix|_: Android emulator maybe?
[11:17:25] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... I don't have it set up though ...
[11:17:40] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: Trying a Nokia C7 ...
[11:19:54] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: I can try to set it up, but I need to do some major popup overhauling, because the navigation incursions are getting out of hand. I want to try to handle popups via changePage, instead of all the custom navigation code I've been writing.
[11:32:21] <deAtog> _|Nix|_: I understand.. you should overhaul the navigation while you're at it.. it's a mess
[11:34:14] <deAtog> _|Nix|_: something as simple as adding a history index to the hash should fix the majority of the hash issues.. other than that, navigating via the hash should be a fallback when the browser doesn't support pushstate
[11:34:36] <deAtog> or doesn't implement pushState properly

[14:03:11] <agcolom> toddparker ?? hi are you around?
[14:07:05] <agcolom> toddparker: just to let you know that I've just had my meeting with Richard... I'm all setup... Hope to have something to show you on Thursday.
[14:27:24] <jzaefferer> johnbender: what now?
[14:28:29] <jzaefferer> why are there more then three dozen branches?
[14:28:50] <jzaefferer> I'm responsible for one, `gruntonly`, johnbender you probably don't need that anymore, right?
[15:00:09] <johnbender> jzaefferer: correct
[15:00:20] <johnbender> we need to do some cleanup that's for sure :D
[15:00:58] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I'll start a quick thread to get the ones we need to keep from the team
[15:01:05] <johnbender> and then clean out the rest in the next day or two
