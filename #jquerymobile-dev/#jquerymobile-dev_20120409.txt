[07:17:00] <Wilto> ’Morning, guys.
[07:19:55] <deAtog> what do you guys think about adding pagevalidating and pagevalidated events?
[07:24:14] <deAtog> toddparker, johnbender, and all other devs, your input would be valuable here
[07:24:47] <Wilto> I’m not sure what you mean when you say “validating/validated.”
[07:28:11] <deAtog> Wilto: they're just a set of events to allow developers a chance to validate their forms, and possibly prevent the user from changing the page
[07:28:55] <deAtog> the difference between the validating events and the pagebeforechange, and pagechange events is that they occur on the page and not on the container
[07:29:15] <Wilto> Couldn’t one use pagebeforeload?
[07:29:33] <Wilto> I wouldn’t want to name the events after their assumed usage, either.
[07:29:41] <deAtog> the page might already be loaded
[07:30:33] <deAtog> Wilto, the names I've suggested are pretty standard names.. in other languages
[07:32:14] <deAtog> Wilto: I'm more or less wondering if I were to implement these additional events if they'd ever find their way into jQM
[07:32:33] <Wilto> If the page is sometimes loading anyway—even if you’re intercepting it with pagebeforeload—that may well be a bug.
[07:33:55] <deAtog> Wilto: correct me if I'm wrong.. but the pagebeforeload event is called whenever it needs to actually fetch a page right?
[07:35:51] <Wilto> Yeah. Maybe I’m not following what you’re about, here.
[07:36:41] <Wilto> Are you talking about custom events that fire when a form is submitted?
[07:36:47] <toddparker> Wilto: this typo is worth applying to 1.1 too  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3993
[07:36:48] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1h, 13m ago): Docs: Correct typo at attribute-name: data-dividertheme := data-divider-theme
[07:37:31] <Wilto> toddparker: Greenbutton’d. Don’t tell johnbender.
[07:37:37] <deAtog> Wilto: I'm talking about custom events that fire before the page is changed that gives the programmer the opportunity to validate any fields on the page before the page changes

[07:37:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3993 from MauriceG/patch-21 - Mat Marquis
[07:38:36] <Wilto> deAtog: Yeah, I’ll let someone correct me if I’m wrong, but I think you’d just want to use pagebeforeload and then resolve() or reject() depending on the form contents.
[07:38:41] <deAtog> Wilto: right now the only place to do that sort of validation is the pagebeforechange event but that fires on the container and not on the page.. It also fires twice for pages that must be loaded!
[07:39:24] <deAtog> Wilto: Nope that won't work.. the pagebeforeload event only fires if the page isn't in the DOM
[07:39:43] <deAtog> the page very well be already loaded in the DOM
[07:40:20] <deAtog> Wilto: have you ever programmed in .Net?
[07:44:54] <Wilto> I have not, no.
[07:45:50] <elfgoh> Hello this may be a bit off topic. But I have a question about switching a theme for a button by simply clicking on it https://twitter.com/#!/elfgoh/status/189353286799855618 I believe there is no JQM method but am happy to be proven wrong. I believe this may be a useful feature
[07:45:51] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from elfgoh: @jquerymobile Is there a quick way to change the color of a button to a specific theme after clicking on the button? ★ http://bit.ly/IzCrSv
[07:51:22] <deAtog> Wilto: the page container is very similar to a TabControl object http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.tabcontrol.aspx The pagebeforechange and the pagechange events are very similar to it's selecting and selected events respectively. A TabControl contains a list of TabPage objects. TabPages are similar in concept to pages in jQM. Every TabPage has a Validating and a Validated event that occur whe
[07:51:47] <deAtog> The TabPage class can be found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.tabpage.aspx
[07:52:42] <deAtog> jQM has no tabs, but its essentially the same concept. You've got a control with a bunch of pages
[07:54:13] <deAtog> Wilto: What I'm getting at is the current support isn't sufficient for my needs, and it's probably not sufficient for the needs of others either.
[07:54:45] <deAtog> I'm willing to implement the stuff I need, but I'm sure others would like to make use of it as well..
[07:55:32] <Wilto> Well, all suggestions are considered for certain, but it’s something we’d have to discuss internally.
[07:56:24] <Wilto> That said, for anything along these lines to be considered in the first place, we really need an issue flied. This forum is _only_ for the sake of communication between the core devs—not for feedback, feature requests, or issue reporting. We can’t monitor this channel for incoming issues at all times.
[07:57:10] <Wilto> Before you start on anything, I would file an issue outlining what you’ve just explained to me. Otherwise, it’s relying on our memories and the telephone game—I couldn’t possibly guarantee anything.
[07:58:10] <deAtog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3977
[07:58:11] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3977 on jquery-mobile (deAtog; 2d, 22h ago): Page change events poorly documented/implemented
[07:58:35] <Wilto> …Okay.
[07:58:54] <Wilto> So then comment on that issue with your questions about events based on validation.
[07:59:01] <deAtog> I did..
[07:59:39] <Wilto> And this was Friday. And now it is Monday morning.
[07:59:49] <Wilto> These things take time, man.
[08:00:57] <deAtog> right.. but I'm willing to work on implementing it if there's a possibility that it can get pulled into jQM
[08:01:20] <Wilto> Which is awesome, don’t get me wrong.
[08:01:41] <Wilto> But we don’t—and can’t—drop everything to discuss a specific issue at a moment’s notice. There’s no shortage of things to get done.
[08:02:21] <Wilto> Please be patient, and if you have further questions post them to the issue you’ve filed.
[08:15:19] <toddparker> this seems like a simple logic issue we might want to pull in for 1.1 final - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3988

[08:15:45] <toddparker> johnbender? ^
[08:16:47] <Wilto> That attribute is a beast.
[08:45:54] <gseguin> morning all
[08:49:05] <Wilto> ’Sup, gseguin.
[09:35:08] <johnbender> toddparker: yah I'm looking into it
[09:36:41] <johnbender> Wilto: I take it there weren't any tests for data-divider-theme :( :(
[09:36:55] <Wilto> johnbender: Wait, are we failing?
[09:37:00] <Wilto> I thought there were one or two.
[09:37:19] <johnbender> Wilto: one sec
[09:37:45] <johnbender> Wilto: ah the changes were in the docs not the api
[09:37:50] <johnbender> nevermind!
[09:38:15] <johnbender> green button docs changes like it's going out of style imo
[09:46:50] <Wilto> Oh, yeah. That’s my greenbutton rule: docs changes only.
[09:47:04] <Wilto> Or, like, a comment typo fix.
[09:53:56] <johnbender> toddparker: on the data-visible-on-page-show=false, that's the sort of thing that tests are really good for - ie, making sure the feature works :D
[10:02:53] <Wilto> johnbender: On it as we speak. Patching that sucker up, and I’ll put a test up in thurr.
[10:03:18] <Wilto> I’m gonna perpetually defer to you on this question: I’ll commit all this to 1.2, but should I cherry-pick it back to 1.1 as well?
[10:03:32] <Wilto> Provided you think it’s small enough to sneak under the radar, I mean.
[10:03:42] <Wilto> I wouldn’t want to put us into a new RC.
[10:03:56] <johnbender> Wilto: actually I'm looking into that one too
[10:04:01] <johnbender> Wilto: I don't think the pr is necessary though
[10:04:04] <johnbender> I'm testing something
[10:04:19] <Wilto> DAMMIT, BENDER
[10:05:00] <Wilto> Wat’chu testing?
[10:05:09] <johnbender> just checking agains = 'false'
[10:05:15] <johnbender> instead of swapping the default
[10:06:10] <Wilto> I was just gonna check for the attr not being `undefined`, without changing the default.
[10:07:00] <johnbender> Wilto: data-visibla-blah=true ?
[10:07:22] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm also going to pull in the pr and just change it so that guy gets credit
[10:07:28] <Wilto> visible = $el.jqmData( "visible-on-page-show" ) […] if( visible !== undefined ) { $el.show( visible ); }
[10:07:55] <johnbender> Wilto: the attribute is set in the options by the widget, no need to use the selector
[10:08:24] <johnbender> Wilto: it will defer to the data attribute on the element
[10:09:13] <Wilto> Oh, oh, right.
[10:11:05] <Wilto> Anyway, I haven’t really dug in yet: all yours, if you’re in there.
[10:11:14] <johnbender> Wilto: cool
[10:11:21] <Wilto> Thanks, bruh.
[10:11:28] <johnbender> no probs?
[10:11:36] * johnbender is still working on his brospeak
[10:11:53] <Wilto> I’m fluent, perhaps tragically.
[10:16:19] <johnbender> Wilto: hmm, now I'm wondering if this means the headers should be hidden by default?
[10:16:26] <johnbender> hence the pr
[10:16:35] <johnbender> that seems odd to me
[10:16:38] <Wilto> Nah, I think they should be shown by default.
[10:16:41] <johnbender> kk
[10:16:44] <johnbender> PR is win then
[10:16:47] <johnbender> pull it in
[10:17:01] <Wilto> ON IT
[10:18:56] <johnbender> Wilto: hmm, the default value is false though
[10:19:00] <johnbender> for _visible
[10:19:10] <Wilto> One sec.
[10:19:14] <johnbender> now we need to ask Scott because there might be other untested functionality that depends on it being hidden
[10:20:33] <Wilto> Ain’t ever simple.
[10:20:36] <johnbender> newp
[10:20:50] <johnbender> and this is one of those cases where we could introduce new bugs quite easily without paying attention
[10:20:54] <johnbender> Wilto: TO BASECAMP
[10:21:26] <Wilto> johnbender: I’m not sure why _visible: defaults to false, honestly.
[10:21:42] <johnbender> Wilto: yep, time to ask the guy who wrote it
[10:21:51] <Wilto> True that.
[10:48:36] <gseguin> Hey guys, I have a conflicting meeting, I won't make it to the BB sync up
[10:52:41] <Wilto> NOOOOO
[10:53:05] <Wilto> S’cool. Anything specific anyone wants to cover?
[10:53:52] <Wilto> I wonder if the BB team would be cool with using Google Hangouts. Beats the hell outta conference calls.
[10:56:53] <johnbender> Wilto: I don't have anything, I'm working on a PR so I'm going to skip it if that's ok
[10:56:58] <johnbender> hmm
[10:57:00] <Wilto> Sure, no worries.
[10:57:12] <johnbender> Wilto: hmm maybe I'll just listen in
[10:58:18] <Wilto> Your call, man. I got nothin’ to go over, really—unless they’ve got something on-deck, I assume it’s gonna be a short call.
[10:58:34] <johnbender> Wilto: ok just ping me if you need me
[10:58:50] <Wilto> johnbender: Will do.
