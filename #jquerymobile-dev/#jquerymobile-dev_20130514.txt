[03:26:26] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06page-sections 143101d82 15Gabriel Schulhof: Toolbar: chain up in _setOptions() with this._super( o ) instead of this._superApply( o ).
[03:26:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Now, the tests agree ... weird that it worked in Chrome but not phantomjs ...
[03:29:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you want to use this._superApply(), it seems you must use this._superApply( arguments );
[03:30:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess phantomjs is not very forgiving (unlike Chrome) when it comes to the arguments passed to apply() vs. call()
[03:31:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If I read http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-_super correctly, this._super() corresponds to call(), and this._superApply() corresponsds to apply(), meaning that it expects an array that has the same properties as arguments.
[03:31:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: s/that it/that the latter/
[03:46:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Now, on to the really mind-boggling test (with the theme inheritance).
[04:11:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The reason that test fails is that page.sections used to add a bunch of options to the page prototype. These options are absent with your changes. So, in a sense, the assumptions of the failing test are wrong.

[05:27:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you still here?
[05:57:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I am. What's up?
[05:58:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thanks for figuring out the phantom issue. however the other test is not what you think. if you look at the tests i have changed those to check within the toolbar widget where i moved those options. though the one thats specificly failing is still within the page widget as part of the options object
[05:58:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[05:59:15] <arschmitz> but im not too worried about that test right this second
[06:01:17] <arschmitz> going to try and get the majority working and then look back at specific ones
[06:02:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[06:02:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Glad to help out!
[06:02:36] <arschmitz> i appreciate it was driving me nuts
[06:53:31] <gseguin> Good morning
[06:53:40] <gseguin> arschmitz: what did I remove?
[06:53:40] <arschmitz> gseguin: morning
[06:53:59] <arschmitz> page widget from jquery.mobile.js
[06:54:02] <arschmitz> but its fine
[06:54:15] <arschmitz> you did it because its always included
[06:54:57] <arschmitz> was just trying to figure out a test that was failing and noticed it wasent in there and it seemed odd
[06:55:21] <gseguin> yeah probably because it gets included by way of dependency
[06:55:28] <arschmitz> yup
[06:56:21] <gseguin> yup
[06:58:03] <arschmitz> gseguin: im just trying to get all the tests to pass with the new toolbar widget and removing page.sections
[06:58:22] <arschmitz> page.sections was in SOOOOOO many places and effects sooo many tests lol
[06:59:38] <gseguin> so what "replaces" page.sections?
[06:59:56] <arschmitz> the stuff for content was moved to page widget
[07:00:04] <arschmitz> and the toolbar stuff is now a toolbar widget
[07:01:13] <arschmitz> its not in master yet of course but you can see it in the page-sections branch
[07:02:35] <gseguin> cool
[07:03:01] <arschmitz> yeah just trying to get all the tests green 
[07:04:10] <gseguin> yeah I've always thought that the sections belonged in the page widget
[07:04:27] <arschmitz> gseguin: any idea why id get Warning: 0/0 assertions ran (0ms) Use --force to continue. when running grunt test --suites=listview ??
[07:04:55] <arschmitz> they all run and pass in browser
[07:05:19] <gseguin> Do you have a test that's empty?
[07:05:24] <arschmitz> gseguin: never had it do that before
[07:05:37] <gseguin> hmm...
[07:05:37] <arschmitz> gseguin: no i have not touch listview at all was just checking it
[07:05:50] <gseguin> and it's consistent?
[07:05:56] <arschmitz> yup
[07:06:49] <arschmitz> its fine on master so clearly iv change something thats effecting it
[07:07:44] <arschmitz> gseguin: weird if i run grunt test the listview tests are fine
[07:07:44] <gseguin> weird
[07:08:04] <arschmitz> its only if i do grunt test --suites=listview
[07:08:04] <gseguin> so you have modified listview, right?
[07:08:11] <arschmitz> no
[07:08:12] <arschmitz> have not changed a thing
[07:09:23] <gseguin> what if you run only listview tests in the browser
[07:09:38] <arschmitz> work fine
[07:10:52] <gseguin> and on master grunt test --suites=listview works?
[07:11:10] <arschmitz> yup
[07:13:09] <gseguin> then I have no clue
[07:13:13] <gseguin> sorry
[07:13:24] <gseguin> is it pushed to the central repo?
[07:13:43] <arschmitz> ill push the latest changes
[07:14:05] <gseguin> I don't think I'll have time today but I can take a look tomorrow
[07:18:41] <arschmitz> cool ill let you know if i figure it out first
[07:20:05] <_|Nix|_> Isn't js/jquery.mobile.js supposed to depend on /everything/ directly?
[07:20:20] <_|Nix|_> That is, shouldn't widgets/page.js be in there for that reason?
[07:21:46] <gseguin> jquery.mobile.js should have all the top-level components 
[07:34:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin|away: Oh, really? So js/jquery.mobile.js should not include /anything/ that gets pulled in indirectly?
[07:37:47] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: it doesn't really matter
[07:38:33] <gseguin> but the thing is if one component is not required by anything, then requiring only top-level would cause unecessary modules to be dropped
[07:38:40] <gseguin> does that make sense?
[07:40:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Exactly, which is why that file should depend on every other file in js/
[07:40:40] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: To make sure that, if used as the starting point for a build, then the entire library will be included.
[07:41:13] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OTOH, if one component is not required by anything, it /is/ a top-level component.
[07:41:43] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Still, I think it's much easier to include everything than to figure out what the top level components are.
[07:42:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That way, we could even build js/jquery.mobile.js by doing a find js -type f | grep '\.js$'

[08:56:41] <johnbender> arschmitz: yes
[08:57:20] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok cool a bit confused by navigation unit tests. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/tests/unit/navigation
[08:57:29] <arschmitz> theres no tests there lol
[08:57:47] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah I have that removed in my tree
[08:57:48] <johnbender> take it out
[08:57:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: not sure how that got left in there
[08:58:07] <johnbender> there are no navigation unit tests just yet
[08:58:09] <johnbender> well
[08:58:10] <johnbender> there are
[08:58:13] <johnbender> but I haven't split them out
[08:58:15] <arschmitz> ok cool because obviously that does not pass it just times out
[08:58:31] <johnbender> the navigator and history object tests are unit tests but I haven't moved them
[08:59:14] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok cool just trying to get all tests passing on my branch and got to that one and was like uhh theres no tests here of course it times out!
[09:01:05] <arschmitz> johnbender: no need for you to look into this right now just wondering if you might have a thought right off the top of your head
[09:01:21] <arschmitz> when i run grunt test everything is green for listview
[09:01:38] <arschmitz> johnbender: but if i run grunt test --suites=listview
[09:02:06] <arschmitz> i get Warning: 0/0 assertions ran (0ms) Use --force to continue.

[11:24:07] <arschmitz> johnbender: been watching your commits / issue updates lookinh good
[11:24:26] <johnbender> it's proceeding nicely
[11:24:30] <johnbender> no issues
[11:24:34] <johnbender> just cleaning things up
[11:24:40] <johnbender> this whole thing will be a first pass
[11:24:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: got green on the whole suite execpt that one dialog test
[11:24:52] <johnbender> it's already easier to think about how things should be set up
[11:25:05] <arschmitz> yeah the whole setup seems so much more logical
[11:25:07] <johnbender> especially as a content management widget
[11:25:31] <johnbender> eg, I was thinkin we should move the navigation event handling OUT of the widget
[11:25:35] <johnbender> that's "glue"
[11:25:44] <johnbender> you might want to change the content on other events
[11:25:50] <johnbender> s/you/one/
[11:25:56] <johnbender> etc
[11:26:09] <johnbender> doing transition now
[11:26:10] <arschmitz> the content widget combined with removing the dependencies on page from the rest of the widgets will make the whole framework much much more flexible
[11:26:13] <johnbender> and then change page
[11:26:16] <johnbender> then I'll be ready to merge
[11:26:22] <johnbender> yar
[11:26:38] <arschmitz> and yeah i agree about the events
[11:26:53] <johnbender> then after 1.4 the next step is to sort out how you would add multiple content widgets to a single page
[11:26:59] <johnbender> modulo scrolling
[11:27:06] <arschmitz> because for example i have a use case right now where i would probably implement containers instead and one is a form and it updates search results
[11:27:13] <johnbender> bingo
[11:27:26] <arschmitz> and it does updates on change event on the inputs
[11:27:38] <johnbender> simple two container setup there
[11:27:44] <arschmitz> thats a perfect use for the container widget
[11:27:46] <arschmitz> exactly
[11:27:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool we'll use that for a demo :)
[11:28:01] <johnbender> probably 1.5 would be my guess
[11:28:08] <arschmitz> right now i just use an ajax call and replace the content on my own
[11:28:09] <johnbender> 1.4 is just making it less insane and better tested
[11:28:19] <arschmitz> but this would make it just work automaticly
[11:28:32] <johnbender> arschmitz: the added bonus would be transitions between content 
[11:28:35] <arschmitz> and add history
[11:28:40] <johnbender> yar
[11:28:41] <arschmitz> yup thats true too
[11:28:49] <johnbender> there are many good things
[11:28:52] <johnbender> just have to get it done
[11:29:09] <johnbender> arschmitz: I'm going to keep that use case in my head
[11:29:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: the scrolling will be necessary if we ever want to support tablet UI
[11:29:40] <arschmitz> awesome yeah i think inventory search is a REALLY common use case
[11:29:59] <johnbender> really any master slave content
[11:30:08] <arschmitz> yup
[11:30:13] <johnbender> search toolbar and results
[11:30:44] <arschmitz> yeah i use a custom panel for the search
[11:31:12] <arschmitz> the whole thing came out pretty good but would be way better with containers
[11:31:18] <johnbender> building up internal abstractions will have external benefits aside from faster change :)
[11:31:36] <johnbender> (if/once we expose them)
[11:32:14] <arschmitz> modularity is a very good thing
[11:32:24] <arschmitz> and reducing dependencies 
[11:33:30] <arschmitz> on a personal level for my own work i use jqm for im REALLY excited for content widget and not having toolbars panels and popups depend on page
[11:34:13] <arschmitz> 90% of the panels toolbars and popups i use are global not page specific so having to include them on every page load is not cool at all
[11:35:16] <arschmitz> i think adding the option to not do any markup enhancement will be good too to beable to send preenhanced markup from a server and just add event bindings in the widgets basicly
[11:36:35] <arschmitz> johnbender: not sure if you saw but a while back i also added the ability to ignore data- options on widgets if your just using default options makes widget init a lot faster
[11:37:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[11:37:12] <johnbender> arschmitz: ahh that's nice
[11:37:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[11:38:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hoping you can clue me in on some dialog themeing i have two tests that look identical to me but give different results ( passing ) and it does not seem like this should be the case
[11:38:42] <arschmitz> so there must be some sort of theme inheritance going on im not aware of
[11:39:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: okay lemme check
[11:39:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: should I look in page-sections branch?
[11:39:31] <arschmitz> nah i can show you on master just a sec
[11:39:37] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:39:46] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/integration/dialog/index.html#L97
[11:40:03] <arschmitz> that dialog and the one below it only difference i can see is overlay theme
[11:40:41] <uGoMobi> what test is failing?
[11:40:44] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/integration/dialog/dialog_events.js#L158
[11:41:07] <arschmitz> that test and the one on line 187 both pass on master
[11:41:29] <arschmitz> but i cant see why 187 should pass it should be the same on both??
[11:42:09] <arschmitz> thats my only failing test on page-sections branch but i cant fix it because i dont understand why it should pass in the first place lol
[11:42:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is $.mobile.page.prototype.options.footerTheme still in your code?
[11:42:45] <uGoMobi> it was on the top of the page.sections file
[11:42:54] <uGoMobi> same for headerTheme
[11:43:00] <arschmitz> its the content test that fails
[11:43:04] <arschmitz> not header and footer
[11:43:21] <arschmitz> and its still there just in pagewidget options
[11:43:46] <uGoMobi> ah ok line 159 
[11:43:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: to be clear im not really trying to figure out why mine is failing im trying to figure out why master is passing lol
[11:44:11] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:44:47] <arschmitz> as far as i can see 159 and 187 should give same result
[11:44:49] <arschmitz> but they dont
[11:49:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't understand why they pass either
[11:49:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the page has the ui-body-e class but content doesn't get a theme class at all
[11:50:02] <uGoMobi> just transparent
[11:51:47] <uGoMobi> maybe in the beginning the body theme class from page was copied to content
[11:52:07] <uGoMobi> but this test shouldn't pass with current code
[11:54:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: correction, looks like content should have ui-body-d https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/integration/dialog/dialog_events.js#L10
[11:55:59] <arschmitz> ah ok that makes sense kinda execpt that that would need to run before the widgets initalize
[11:56:28] <arschmitz> or else it would be too late which in the case of tests it should already be too late
[11:56:50] <uGoMobi> true but I think test setup takes care of that
[11:57:11] <uGoMobi> but I don't see any code that adds a theme class to dialog content
[11:57:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: or its done here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/integration/dialog/dialog_events.js#L158
[11:57:24] <arschmitz> oops 
[11:57:29] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/integration/dialog/index.html#L13
[11:58:24] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:58:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and it was set here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/integration/dialog/index.html#L13
[11:58:51] <arschmitz> doh
[11:58:58] <arschmitz> my copy and paste is wierd
[11:59:04] <uGoMobi> but still it should be ui-body-d and we test hasClass ui-body-e
[11:59:05] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/page.sections.js#L97
[12:00:21] <uGoMobi> yes, if you set a theme for content the ui-body- class will be added
[12:00:42] <arschmitz> im so confused by these tests and why they pass lol
[12:01:13] <uGoMobi> but we set "e" for the page and "d" for the content
[12:01:18] <uGoMobi> so I don't get it either
[12:01:36] <arschmitz> lol
[12:02:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: now you see my delima i need to fix a test that as far as i can see should not work to begin with
[12:02:17] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:02:53] <arschmitz> an its the only test not passing on the page-sections branch
[12:05:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you change the test to hasClass ui-body-z does it still pass?
[12:05:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not sure ill try
[12:08:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup still passes if i change the top of the two files to set prototype to z it still passes
[12:09:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I just checked the test with code inspector and it does get ui-body-e class
[12:09:22] <uGoMobi> but where is it coming from?!?
[12:10:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont know its like its getting it from data-theme
[12:11:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, like we copy it
[12:11:23] <uGoMobi> checking the widgets now
[12:12:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think I found it

[12:20:35] <uGoMobi> because CSS theme inheritance won't work in that case
[12:22:03] <uGoMobi> if page has ui-body-b and content ui-body-a the widgets will use theme "b" from page
[12:22:20] <uGoMobi> there is no way I can look for closest
[12:22:39] <arschmitz> yeah i think we should deprecate on content
[12:22:41] <uGoMobi> I could do it with increasing specificity
[12:22:53] <uGoMobi> but I am running out of selectors :)
[12:23:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: intresting the test on line 187 is getting a false positive
[12:23:30] <arschmitz> if i check the class in console and echo $.mobile.page.prototype.options.contentTheme
[12:23:35] <arschmitz> they dont match lol
[12:23:45] <uGoMobi> huh
[12:24:07] <uGoMobi> but can change a theme like that after init?
[12:24:13] <arschmitz> i added console.log($.mobile.page.prototype.options.contentTheme)
[12:24:15] <uGoMobi> s/can/can you/
[12:24:24] <arschmitz> it says d as it should
[12:25:08] <arschmitz> wait nevermind i was looking at the outer div not content by accident
[12:25:15] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:30:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i see the break down in the test page.sections looked at data-theme and the option theme as two different things with two different priorities
[12:31:12] <arschmitz> but in a widget they are the same thing

[12:32:39] <jqcommit> 13jquerymobile.com/06master 14cb87baa 15Scott González: Added CONTRIBUTING.md.
[12:32:47] <arschmitz> ok this all makes sense now :)
[12:38:27] <arschmitz> WOO! all green
[12:48:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: would it be better for you if i merge the toolbar stuff sooner rather then later?
[12:56:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sweet!
[12:57:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup 100% green test suite
[12:58:05] <arschmitz> so at these point i want to refactor some things and write some more tests but its good to merge into master at any point
[13:10:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome
[13:10:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: think it's better if you merge in master first
[13:11:15] <uGoMobi> I'll merge master into next after that
[13:11:23] <arschmitz> works for me
[13:11:27] <uGoMobi> cool
[13:11:32] <arschmitz> i can merge pretty much any time 
[13:11:52] <arschmitz> anything i have left to do i can do on master since all is working and green
[13:12:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I'm going to call it a day now so no rush
[13:13:03] <arschmitz> cool
[13:14:56] <_|Nix|_> Did I mention I f0rking hate debugging on mobile platforms? Can't even console.log :/
[13:16:15] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: I saw recently that you can do that but I can't remember who was showing that!
[13:16:31] <agcolom> Could it be with Google dev tools?
[13:16:33] <uGoMobi> I can on Android Chrome
[13:16:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[13:16:51] <agcolom> ah :-)
[13:16:56] <arschmitz> can on ios 6 too
[13:17:04] <uGoMobi> and you can also do it with Mac + Mobile Safari
[13:17:05] <arschmitz> actually ios6 is really nice now if you have a mac
[13:17:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: have you actually tried it? it works great
[13:18:03] <uGoMobi> not mobile safari, still on linux here
[13:18:23] <uGoMobi> although I think I am going to buy a MBP
[13:18:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh yeah its really nice can get the full safari inspector just like normal
[13:18:57] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Of course you can! If you have a laptop running OSX ...
[13:19:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can debug Android Chrome on Linux/Win as well
[13:20:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's great 'n all, if only the bug was on Android Chrome: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5991
[13:20:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's on iOS ...
[13:20:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: (Spoiler alert)
[13:20:22] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:20:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then ask arschmitz to debug
[13:20:47] <_|Nix|_> F0rking Apple ... I hate them almost as much as M$.
[13:21:25] <_|Nix|_> Not that I like any of them a lot ... we could really use an open standard for connecting to a mobile browser.
[13:22:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if you need anything let me know
[13:22:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's fine ... I'll figure something out ... I'll make a <pre><code id="console"></code></pre> ...
[13:23:15] <arschmitz> lol ok
[13:23:48] <arschmitz> well in the future dont hesitate to ask takes 2 seconds to hook up
[13:24:18] <_|Nix|_> I have a php script that would replace console.log and POST stuff back to the server ... stopped working in iOS 6 ... bastards won't even let me phone home :(
[13:25:09] <_|Nix|_> Oh, and forget creating a new window ...
[13:26:58] <_|Nix|_> But, I think I can use our wonderful navigation features to create a two-page document. The other page is the console. 
[13:27:02] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15ottoville opened issue #6005: window.matchMedia polyfill is very bad habbit  02http://git.io/aY697Q
[13:31:45] <_|Nix|_> Check out my 1337 app: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/pages/5991.html
[13:32:04] <_|Nix|_> Swipe left/right for some sick FX!
[13:39:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, there may be a spot where you could help. Can you load http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/pages/5991.html in iOS 6 and hook up the dev tools? Then, click the button to open the popup, click the button to close the popup and click the button to open the popup again. At this point, the button should acquire the active class, but no popup will appear.
[13:39:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you please check that there's no JS error?
[13:39:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've noticed that it doesn't open the second time because there's never a click event - only vclick.
[13:40:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I'm wondering if something is erroring out.
[13:45:28] <agcolom> Hey guys, jQuery Mobile is used by the French government for their app to collect income tax ;-) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.gouv.finances.smartphone.android
[13:47:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Noooooooooo!
[13:47:55] <agcolom> ;-)
[13:49:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sorry was on the phone checking now
[13:50:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks!
[13:51:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For some reason the popup is emitting afterclose twice ...
[13:51:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... so it might still be some logic error.
[13:51:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The top comments weren't too flattering.
[13:51:52] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: This one's great: "Je ne peux rien faire."
[13:52:12] <agcolom> I know ;-)
[13:52:28] <agcolom> terrible! hopefully not a jqm issue ;-)
[13:53:30] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Doubt it. Sounds like they're having trouble scanning some QR code, so it's either some API or what the app does with whatever is scanned.
[13:53:40] <didiergm_> agcolom: no they are blaming a wrong or invalid QRcode which seems mandatory to use the app. I need to find 
[13:54:00] <didiergm_> my own paperwork and see if I can work with it; for "fun" :(
[13:54:12] <_|Nix|_> didiergm_: Just don't get arrested :)
[13:54:14] <agcolom> they have an ios version also 
[13:54:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: want good news or bad news :)
[13:54:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, I do.
[13:54:48] <didiergm_> _|Nix|_ being arrested for paying y taxes ... would be a first 
[13:55:05] <_|Nix|_> didiergm_: Nono ... you think you've paid your taxes, but the app is broken.
[13:55:34] <didiergm_> :)
[13:55:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well popup seems to be working fine i cant reproduce
[13:55:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it's kinda finicky ... 
[13:56:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What device are you trying on?
[13:56:12] <arschmitz> ipad 2 ios 6
[13:56:18] <arschmitz> oh i got it to happen
[13:56:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have an iPod with 6.0.1, so it's probably a little underpowered.
[13:56:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[13:56:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no logs at all
[13:56:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. great.
[13:57:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then it must be a logic error.
[13:57:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I hate having to guess where I need to cast a try/catch net ... better to check if errors appear in the log.
[13:57:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks!
[13:58:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll figure out why afterclose is happening twice.
[13:58:16] <arschmitz> ok
[14:15:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... looks like $.mobile.window.off( o.closeEvents ) does not get rid of nav bindings ... weird ...
[14:15:48] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... I wonder if .off() can handle space-separated events like .on() can ...
[14:16:57] <_|Nix|_> Yep ... just like .on() it can take multiple events ... so, I dunno why the handler ain't removed.
[15:50:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: I just moved changePage into the widget o.o
[15:50:23] <johnbender> let the fun begin
