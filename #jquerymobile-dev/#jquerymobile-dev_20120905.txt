[00:31:03] <_|Nix|_> ?tell gseguin The transition oddness was happening because this.options.transition was being ignored in _open(). So, while the no-transition was being executed on open, the current transition (which will be used upon close) was not being set.
[00:31:03] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.

[04:31:10] <agcolom> hello everyone! I'm back from holiday!!!
[04:32:08] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hey! I visited France during my holidays :) We went to see the European Parliament building in Strasbourg ...
[04:32:28] <_|Nix|_> Very cool ...
[04:32:31] <agcolom> Hi _|Nix|_ ! Excellent!!!!
[04:32:36] <_|Nix|_> The city, too ...
[04:32:52] <_|Nix|_> The drive was great, too - we went from Lake Constance through the black forest.
[04:33:07] <agcolom> That sounds really nice!
[04:33:09] <_|Nix|_> Weather might've been better, but you can't really help that.
[04:33:17] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, pretty awesome ...
[04:33:50] <agcolom> Can you believe, I finally went up the Eiffel Tower (after living near Paris until the age of 21/22!)
[04:33:57] <_|Nix|_> My first time ever in France - same for my wife, her parents, and my daughter :)
[04:34:01] <agcolom> for the 1st time!
[04:34:18] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: It's a strange feeling being a tourist in your own country, eh?
[04:34:32] <agcolom> yes, it's great actually!
[04:34:44] <agcolom> I must do that again!
[04:35:01] <agcolom> and I must do all the tourist things in London as well!!!
[04:35:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I felt the same way when I revisited my birthplace after not having seen it for 14 years.
[04:35:35] <agcolom> whoah! 14 years!
[04:35:43] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I was like, "I know the way!", and "This mall wasn't there when I left!" :)
[04:36:03] <agcolom> yes, I thing things must have changed quite a bit in that time!
[04:36:14] <agcolom> is that Hungary?
[04:36:19] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Romania.
[04:36:29] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: They turned an army base into a shopping mall :)
[04:36:45] <agcolom> Much better! A lot more my style ;)
[04:36:50] <_|Nix|_> No doubt :)
[04:37:15] <agcolom> It's nice when places change for the better!
[04:37:30] <_|Nix|_> *nod*
[04:37:40] <agcolom> now why did I think you were from Hungary?
[04:37:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Because I am Hungarian.
[04:38:01] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Romania has a significant hungarian minority.
[04:38:35] <agcolom> oh, I didn't know that! We have a lot of Hungarian people at work. Very hard working and very nice!
[04:39:20] <agcolom> so you're going to Washington also ?
[04:40:32] <agcolom> ok... my daughter starts school tomorrow, and is complaining that lunch isn't ready! Catch you later :-)
[04:44:19] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, some of them might easily be from Romania (Transylvania, to be precise).

[05:17:46] <agcolom> todd_: toddmparker_ : Hi! I'm finally back! I guess we are nearly ready to launch 1.2 beta? I have noticed something in the docs that may need changing before beta is out...
[05:47:55] <_|Nix|_> How do I make a new label for issues? I've already found two issues which should go under on-the-fly options, which we'll tackle after 1.2 ...
[05:48:34] <_|Nix|_> Maybe I don't have the privileges necessary to create new labels ...
[06:07:39] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: go to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?state=open
[06:08:45] <agcolom> at the bottom of the page and under the list of labels you should see a text input field to add a new label
[06:09:33] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Thanks!
[06:09:43] <_|Nix|_> There's, like "Manage Labels" too ...
[06:09:47] <agcolom> you're welcome :-)

[07:02:46] <todd_> _|Nix|_: Cool, you fixed that popup transition wonkiness with slide?
[07:02:59] <todd_> seems like we're in good shape
[07:03:10] <todd_> thanks for those doc updates agcolom
[07:03:14] <todd_> welcome back!

[07:19:28] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: thanks
[07:19:43] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: did it make it into beta.1 ?
[07:24:47] <_|Nix|_> I have no idea. I committed it to master.
[07:24:57] <gseguin> I'll check
[07:25:06] <_|Nix|_> Have we tagged since then?
[07:26:03] <gseguin> we haven't tagged
[07:26:05] <_|Nix|_> I ain't seein' no new tags ...
[07:26:25] <gseguin> yep
[07:26:33] <todd_> hey all - I'm back
[07:26:42] <gseguin> well that's good and bad
[07:26:46] <todd_> My mac freaked out again. When is that 13" retina coming out.
[07:26:48] <gseguin> hey todd_
[07:26:57] <todd_> hey gseguin
[07:27:01] <todd_> so what  did I miss
[07:27:33] <gseguin> not much, looks like _|Nix|_ pushed a fix for the transition weirdness w/ popup
[07:27:48] <gseguin> and we realised that we haven't tagged yet
[07:28:19] <gseguin> is released planned for today?
[07:28:35] <todd_> we can release whenever we want
[07:28:40] <gseguin> ok
[07:28:50] <todd_> so johnbender can tag soon-ish
[07:29:06] <gseguin> johnbender: don't forget the version.txt
[07:29:43] <Wilto> guys guys you guys
[07:29:48] <Wilto> https://github.com/blog/1227-status-api
[07:30:45] <gseguin> oh wow!
[07:30:51] <gseguin> that's pretty cool
[07:31:42] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: Hey! -- I see another popup issue on iPad 2 + 3 now: I open the docs at /test > Pages & dialogs > Popups > opening the very first link shows the popup at the origin and then the popup jumps to the windows center. But only the first time.
[07:31:46] <gseguin> this is going to get Bender excited
[07:31:56] <MauriceG> May somebody else can test this also
[07:31:58] <gseguin> you can test stuff before landing them
[07:34:04] <todd_> i'd love to have tests run against PRs like that
[07:34:13] <todd_> sure this would make johnbender a happy camper
[07:34:53] <Wilto> I friggin’ love this idea.
[07:41:05] <todd_> MauriceG: what iOS version?
[07:41:59] <todd_> _|Nix|_: ok, I can reproduce on iOS5.1
[07:42:17] <todd_> on /test/ navigate to popups, click the firstpopup example.
[07:42:24] <todd_> it will open, then shift to the center
[07:42:34] <todd_> so something with that latest change isn't 100%
[07:42:34] <MauriceG> todd_: 5.1 -- but I got it.  If you tap on the border of the button, the button get no active state and the popup opens and act as described above
[07:43:24] <todd_> MauriceG: seems to be a bug
[07:43:53] <todd_> gseguin, _|Nix|_ or johnbender - theories on why?
[07:44:41] <gseguin> none
[07:51:40] <_|Nix|_> todd_: No idea, but I need to grab my iPod Touch from the office, I suspect.
[07:52:21] <_|Nix|_> todd_: ... but the only reason it would be happening is that there's a window resize going on that triggers the center-to-window-upon-resize code.
[07:56:02] <MauriceG> most of the time both, the page and the button gets the tap.   The fixed header on that page is scrolling out (or in) and the popup is shown as well.
[07:57:54] <_|Nix|_> The strange thing is, it no longer centers to the window upon resize in Desktop Chrome. That is, if I open a popup that's positionTo="origin" and I drag the edges of the Chrome window it no longer jumps to the center of it.
[08:01:40] <todd_> we recently added the fixed header to make sure we're testing that
[08:01:45] <_|Nix|_> OK ... NM ... it's working O_o ... must've been /really/ tired when I thought I saw that.
[08:01:58] <todd_> seems like there are more resize events firing. try opening the form and using the keyboard
[08:02:06] <todd_> it works but jumps 1-2 times
[08:02:36] <_|Nix|_> Wow!
[08:02:43] <todd_> so this jump is a blocker IMHO
[08:02:55] <todd_> it must be something with that last change _|Nix|_
[08:03:35] <todd_> cool app service that lets you build slick mobile apps with jQM front end
[08:03:41] <todd_> made this in 2 minutes
[08:03:42] <todd_> http://t.apcanv.as/builder/504749a9ca9d0aa341000049/preview/50474bc6ca9d0aa341000061
[08:03:45] <todd_> check the left nav
[08:05:30] <_|Nix|_> todd_: What last change?
[08:07:23] <todd_> to fix the popup transitions
[08:07:26] <todd_> last night
[08:08:19] <_|Nix|_> todd_: It wasn't happening before that?
[08:08:47] <todd_> nope
[08:08:53] <todd_> it was fine last night
[08:08:58] <todd_> i can see this on my iPhone too
[08:09:10] <todd_> an I 100% know it was ok last night
[08:09:20] <_|Nix|_> todd_: OK.
[08:09:26] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Maybe something about 1.8.1?
[08:09:46] <MauriceG> I'm unable to reproduce that on an android 2.2.1 device (archos tablet) but on iPhone 4S 5.1
[08:09:46] <_|Nix|_> todd_: We had some issues last time as well - that height hack ...
[08:10:50] <_|Nix|_> I should be in posession of a iOS 5.1.1 device tomorrow.
[08:10:58] <todd_> Hrm. Now I can't reproduce on my iphone
[08:11:08] <todd_> definitely there on ipad
[08:11:47] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Can you try with an older version of jQuery?
[08:11:55] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Just curious if that's it.
[08:12:16] <todd_> grrr
[08:12:22] <todd_> now I can't reproduce on ipad
[08:12:31] <_|Nix|_> It's a Heisonbug.
[08:12:37] <_|Nix|_> s/o/e/
[08:13:17] <todd_> ah, so only if you start at home, refresh then navigate in
[08:13:22] <todd_> if you refresh, it's ok!
[08:13:36] <_|Nix|_> Another one that only happens when you navigate in ...
[08:13:49] <todd_> yep
[08:14:58] <todd_> and only if you don't scroll the page
[08:15:06] <todd_> if you scroll, it's ok. doesn't move
[08:15:11] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[08:15:33] <_|Nix|_> I gotta go now, but I'll BBL.
[08:16:11] <todd_> sort of an edge case
[08:16:13] <MauriceG> todd_:  try to tap on the buttons border. It always happens then on iOS
[08:16:57] <todd_> MauriceG: I can't get that to do anything odd
[08:17:25] <todd_> I got it
[08:17:42] <todd_> that seems to be because your tap also hits the page and toggles the fixed header
[08:18:59] <todd_> alright, going to say this iPad jump is sort of an edge case
[08:19:09] <todd_> not a blocker but we should try to see what's up
[08:19:27] <todd_> so we're good
[08:27:14] <Wilto> I think I have an idea on the iPad jump dealie.
[08:27:26] <Wilto> I can check it out a little later on; maybe I can beat the buzzer.
[08:27:31] <todd_> ok
[08:27:36] <todd_> otherwise, we're good to go
[08:27:39] <Wilto> Unless said buzzer has buzzed.
[08:27:41] <todd_> fixing up the blog post now
[08:27:49] <todd_> give it a look Wilto
[08:27:54] <Wilto> Sir, yes sir.
[08:30:23] <johnbender> todd_: I'm assuming because I didn't see anything negative in basecamp that the deploy is satisfactory?
[08:30:52] <gseguin> johnbender: was that a test deploy?
[08:31:03] <gseguin> you didn
[08:31:07] <gseguin> t tag
[08:31:09] <todd_> johnbender: seems good, double-checking now
[08:31:15] <todd_> almost ready to tag and announce
[08:31:40] * gseguin needs to reduce coffee consumption to decrease hand twitching
[08:32:53] <todd_> just checked all the CDN links and the zip looks good too
[08:33:11] <todd_> I'm ready to announce…should we tag it?
[08:33:40] <johnbender> gseguin: correct
[08:33:51] <johnbender> gseguin: just wanted to get it out there for todd to check his links
[08:33:57] <johnbender> I'll tag when we're sure we're good
[08:34:03] <johnbender> that's my usual dance at least
[08:34:43] <gseguin> ok
[08:34:49] <gseguin> just making sure
[08:35:10] <todd_> johnbender: let tag this thing!
[08:35:21] <todd_> ready on the site updates and twitter...
[08:35:41] <johnbender> gseguin: I have to explicitly comment out the check of the version.txt vs the current commit/tag to do it :)

[08:41:45] <gnarf> gseguin: yeah, its just syslog
[08:41:51] <gseguin> k
[08:42:03] <todd_> gseguin: we should add this to download builder
[08:42:20] <gseguin> todd_: add what?

[08:43:29] <todd_> we have alpha there
[08:43:52] <todd_> that's a manual thing, right? doesn't just pick up tags
[08:44:35] <gseguin> it is a manual step
[08:48:28] <gseguin> gnarf: when can we switch to using the new machine ?
[08:48:48] <gseguin> I can't access my no.de machine anymore (looks like)
[08:49:18] <gseguin> todd_: that means I can't update the backend service
[08:49:29] <todd_> woo hoo
[08:49:30] <todd_> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/09/05/jquery-mobile-1-2-beta-released/

[08:49:55] <todd_> nice work everyone. huge change log there
[08:50:02] <uGoMobi> hi all
[08:50:04] <todd_> now don't touch anything :)
[08:50:04] <gseguin> todd_: doesn't look like it is
[08:50:13] <todd_> gseguin: really?
[08:50:44] <todd_> guess we need to switch servers asap
[08:51:01] <gseguin> yeah, that blows
[08:51:09] <gseguin> I can't connect to the machine anymore
[08:54:55] <johnbender> :
[08:54:58] <johnbender> :/ fail
[08:55:08] <johnbender> gseguin: not on your part
[08:56:43] <uGoMobi> impressive list with fixes for 1.2 beta! :)
[08:58:01] <uGoMobi> todd_: FYI https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4895#issuecomment-8303754
[09:00:26] <gnarf> gseguin: is the app on stage working properly?
[09:00:50] <gnarf> johnbender: so, whats with the nightlies on the cdn?
[09:01:55] <gseguin> johnbender: totally
[09:02:03] <gseguin> thought the server is still up
[09:02:56] <gseguin> gnarf: I haven't pointed a front-end at it, let me try that
[09:24:18] <gnarf> gseguin: if this looks good I can push it up to live
[09:26:06] <gnarf> also gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/builder.pp#L59-64
[09:27:00] <gseguin> gnarf: can you add 1.2.0-beta.1 to these?
[09:27:10] <gnarf> gseguin: i can, also - you can
[09:27:33] <gseguin> gnarf: I was checking my access
[09:27:35] <gseguin> yes
[09:27:40] <gseguin> so I'll do it
[09:27:49] <gseguin> that causes the directory to be created ?
[09:28:54] <gseguin> gnarf: ^
[09:29:32] <gnarf> gseguin: sudo puppet agent --test after you add it to the puppet-stage branch
[09:29:58] <gnarf> just did this on jq02.stage
[09:30:04] <gnarf> to get it on the live, make the change in puppet-master
[09:30:15] <gnarf> then run the puppet agent
[09:30:19] <gnarf> (--test)
[09:30:26] <gseguin> ok
[09:30:40] <gnarf> i usually just cherry-pick after a quick test on stage
[09:32:10] <gseguin> sounds good
[09:33:03] <gnarf> does it seem to be working btw?
[09:33:28] <gseguin> struggling with my workstation right now
[09:33:36] <gseguin> recently upgraded to 12.04
[09:33:45] <gseguin> messed up my http server
[09:38:00] <johnbender> gseguin: vagrant my friend
[09:38:04] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm really serious about it
[09:38:08] <johnbender> this time
[09:38:11] <johnbender> you should use it
[09:38:19] <gseguin> I have to look at it
[09:38:45] <johnbender> gseguin: just grab the deb http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.0.3
[09:39:55] <gseguin> thanks johnbender
[09:40:29] <johnbender> gseguin: np, generally the only thing you have to do when you get a virtualbox update is sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup
[09:40:32] <johnbender> and everything works
[09:40:38] <johnbender> your server setup is isolated
[09:40:46] <johnbender> none that crap dirtying up your file system
[09:40:57] <johnbender> gseguin: I also have a branch of jqm that will setup the project for you
[09:41:03] <johnbender> for vagrant
[09:41:04] <gseguin> johnbender: "To install vagrant, these items must be removed: virtualbox-4.1", really?
[09:41:27] <johnbender> gseguin: it's a full package install
[09:41:30] <johnbender> I believe it includes it
[09:41:46] <johnbender> gseguin: do it
[09:41:49] <johnbender> you won't regret it
[09:42:02] <gseguin> I promise I will but not right now
[09:42:06] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[09:42:09] <gseguin> I need to make thing work
[09:42:13] <johnbender> gseguin: let me know if you run into issues
[09:42:21] <gseguin> will do thank you!

[09:43:26] <gnarf> is the current download builder broken?
[09:43:39] <gnarf> like, could i just use the actual site to test it?
[09:45:16] <gseguin> gnarf: you just need to change the /amd-builder redirect
[09:45:23] <gseguin> to point to the staging
[09:45:40] <gseguin> I just curled the staging
[09:45:46] <gseguin> and that seems to work find
[09:45:55] <gseguin> s/find/fine/
[09:46:30] <gnarf> k, its pointed ad live
[09:46:57] <gseguin> 503
[09:47:10] <gnarf> seems happy?
[09:47:13] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile TestSwarm Master build #48: STILL FAILING in 21 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20TestSwarm%20Master/48/
[09:47:16] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/8b19ef940bf873fa9fb7
[09:47:26] <johnbender> yep
[09:47:28] <gseguin> gnarf: http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/ ?
[09:47:31] <johnbender> that's what I'm working on today
[09:48:05] <gseguin> gnarf: I must be missing something
[09:53:06] <gnarf> gseguin: i'm not sure whats broken here
[09:53:12] <gnarf> can you tell me?
[09:53:43] <gseguin> is that /amd-builder still pointing at the no.de machine?
[09:55:04] <gnarf> no
[09:55:12] <gseguin> argh
[09:55:34] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/9e5fcc4772559fffdf8c
[09:56:41] <gseguin> well that's not good
[09:57:05] <gnarf> its pointing at jq02.jquery.com btw
[09:59:43] * gseguin looks
[10:00:32] <gseguin> oh wait, there is no 1.1.1 directory
[10:00:55] * gseguin slaps himself on the wrist for bad error handling
[10:01:10] <todd_> johnbender: shoot, I'm in a meeting
[10:01:16] <todd_> can you hop on the lead call
[10:01:26] <Wilto> Need me to tag in on something?
[10:01:30] <johnbender> todd_: for 30 minutes yes, then I need to take my wife to teh airport
[10:01:32] <Wilto> Ah, gotcha.
[10:02:45] <gseguin> gnarf: ^
[10:05:24] <gnarf> gseguin: made that
[10:05:27] <gnarf> still not working
[10:06:15] <gseguin> gnarf: and now ?
[10:06:35] <gseguin> wait you're playing on staging?
[10:07:20] <gnarf> gseguin: no, jq02.jquery.com -- live server -- thats where the proxy is pointing
[10:07:29] <gseguin> ha
[10:07:32] <gnarf> still seems broken, and I am not sure why
[10:07:33] <gseguin> that's why
[10:07:41] <gseguin> once you've created the directory
[10:07:57] <gnarf> that directory exists
[10:08:14] <gseguin> you need to curl the node service on /v1/jquery/jquery-mobile/1.1.1
[10:08:31] <gseguin> that will checkout the workspace
[10:08:45] <gnarf> oh - has to be via curl?
[10:08:53] <gseguin> neh
[10:09:17] <gnarf> i was hitting the url via chrome
[10:09:24] <gseguin> but in puppet when preping the available tags
[10:09:38] <gseguin> step 1 is to create the dir
[10:09:52] <gseguin> step 2 is to checkout the workspace
[10:10:16] <gnarf> each tag needs its own workspace?
[10:10:19] <gseguin> gnarf: works now
[10:10:23] <gseguin> yeah
[10:11:10] <gnarf> hrm
[10:11:42] <gseguin> meeting, be back around 11:30 MDT
[10:11:55] <gnarf> this seems like a very complicated way of doing this
[10:40:27] <gseguin> gnarf: I can checkout everytime as well
[10:41:07] <gnarf> gseguin: i just put it into the puppet script
[10:41:40] <gseguin> gnarf: cool
[10:42:01] <gseguin> gnarf: I thought checking out every time would be suboptimal
[10:42:13] <gseguin> maybe I can checkout when I get an error
[10:42:24] <gnarf> right, but like the first time it could know and do a checkout
[10:42:41] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile TestSwarm Master build #49: STILL FAILING in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20TestSwarm%20Master/49/
[10:42:46] <gseguin> yeah if the directory is empty I'll do a checkout
[10:43:24] <gnarf> gseguin: so does the builder look correct now?
[10:44:03] <gseguin> yes but the workspaces need to be primed
[10:44:20] <gseguin> to deploy on live I just have to tag with a semver tag, right?
[10:44:57] <gnarf> right
[10:47:30] <gnarf> gseguin: do i need to add a 1.2.0-alpha.1 as well?
[10:47:52] <gseguin> if you touch that config yes, otherwise I'll do it
[10:48:07] <gseguin> gnarf: sorry I misread
[10:48:16] <gseguin> 1.2.0-beta.1
[10:48:35] <gseguin> you can remove alpha I think
[10:49:15] <gseguin> gnarf: let me know when that's done, I'll update the front-end
[10:49:44] <gnarf> gseguin: just made those changes
[10:50:04] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/builder.pp#L59-64
[10:51:26] <gnarf> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/jquery/manifests/mobile/amdbuilder.pp#L37-51
[10:51:31] <gseguin> gnarf: is the front-end updating automatically on push ?
[10:51:48] <gnarf> gseguin: jquerymobile.com ?
[10:52:07] <gseguin> jquerymobile.com/download-builder
[10:52:09] <gnarf> not sure where "the front end" exists here
[10:52:12] <gnarf> I don't think so
[10:52:17] <gnarf> not sure how that is updated
[10:52:21] <gnarf> todd_: ?
[10:52:26] <gseguin> the site is on github
[10:52:37] <gseguin> todd_ wouldn't know I think
[10:53:15] <gseguin> right now I just pull on the http server after I pushed to github
[10:53:26] <gseguin> it would be great if we could automate that
[10:53:26] <gnarf> k
[10:53:39] <gnarf> i think thats what http://control.jquerymobile.com/ is supposed to be doing?
[10:53:48] <gnarf> also, we can automate it, i have a generic post-receive hook
[10:55:48] <gseguin> I just pushed the update of the front-end to  git@github.com:jquery/jquery-mobile-builder.git
[10:58:44] <gseguin> todd_: the builder is updated
[10:58:51] <gseguin> with beta.1
[10:59:01] <gseguin> thank you very much gnarf
[11:04:36] <gnarf> gseguin: so, all you should need to do to add another tag btw is add it to that array in puppet-master and then sudo puppet agent --test on jq02
[11:09:15] <gseguin> gnarf: ok
[11:19:48] <ajpiano> todd_: agcolom is agcolom on the jquery-devs-team email list
[11:37:29] <ryanneufeld> ?tell johnbender is there a way to instruct vagrant to perform a task only once when you first vagrant up?
[11:37:30] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Okay.
[11:42:00] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: no, what are you trying to do?
[11:42:00] <bot-t> (4 mins 30 secs ago) <ryanneufeld> tell johnbender is there a way to instruct vagrant to perform a task only once when you first vagrant up?
[11:42:07] <johnbender> I mean other than the obvious
[11:42:27] <johnbender> if [ blah ]; then do_something; fi
[11:42:31] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: well I'd like to have an init script to prep the machine before provisioning
[11:42:49] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: bash provisioner?
[11:42:51] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:42:55] <ryanneufeld> shell
[11:42:58] <johnbender> is there some reason that doesn't work?
[11:43:01] <ryanneufeld> it works
[11:43:10] <ryanneufeld> but when I'm working on puppet manifests
[11:43:13] <ryanneufeld> and run vagrant provisoin
[11:43:22] <ryanneufeld> I don't need the shell provisioners to run every time
[11:43:24] <johnbender> ah!
[11:43:30] <johnbender> no
[11:43:35] <johnbender> there's no way to do that with vagrant
[11:43:36] <ryanneufeld> for example on the infra stuff, it trys to install puppet every time
[11:43:45] <johnbender> that responisbility is delegated to the provisining scripts
[11:43:52] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: it shouldn't
[11:43:58] <johnbender> it should check the existing version
[11:44:00] <johnbender> that's in there
[11:44:07] <ryanneufeld> yeah, and it errors out :p
[11:44:13] <johnbender> :/
[11:44:18] <johnbender> I would alter that then
[11:44:21] <johnbender> not much option
[11:44:30] <johnbender> an early exit seems like a sane thing to do to me
[11:44:40] <ryanneufeld> oh, it si
[11:44:42] <ryanneufeld> *is
[11:44:44] <johnbender> feel free to do whatever you need to get it working
[11:45:00] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: do you want me to take a look?
[11:45:13] <johnbender> that version check isn't offline friendly either I don't think
[11:45:25] <ryanneufeld> if you want, it was more of an off hand, "I wonder if..."
[11:45:42] <ryanneufeld> I can wave some bash-fu magics on the scripts and make the behave
[11:46:43] <ryanneufeld> I just thought a "do this only when upping a new box" would be a useful feature
[11:46:48] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: yah there's nothing like that, though Vagrant has an _extensive_ plugin api
[11:46:54] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[11:47:02] <ryanneufeld> Well, then...
[11:47:06] * ryanneufeld evil laughs
[11:47:16] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: the only downside to that is that it breaks the concept of idempotency in provisioning scripts
[11:47:26] <johnbender> which is sort of a standard
[11:47:41] <johnbender> I should say "provisioning actions"
[11:47:47] <johnbender> since it's at the vagrant level
[11:48:19] <ryanneufeld> okay, I can see what you mean
[11:48:29] <ryanneufeld> vagrants job is to do stuff
[11:48:38] <ryanneufeld> and the stuff should make sure it's got it's ducks in a row
[11:48:49] <johnbender> yah it just lines up the pins
[11:48:57] <johnbender> you have to knock them down in provisioning
[11:49:01] <ryanneufeld> I'm happy either way, though it does do other one-time stuff
[11:49:12] <johnbender> such as?
[11:49:13] <ryanneufeld> such as network config etc
[11:49:18] <ryanneufeld> doesn't it?
[11:49:25] <ryanneufeld> cloning the box
[11:49:38] <johnbender> the middleware stacks that makeup the commands internally don't change
[11:49:42] <ryanneufeld> if you change the base image and do a reload it doesn't re-clone (probably a good thing)
[11:49:53] <johnbender> they check to see if that action is necessary
[11:50:10] <ryanneufeld> it's likely that I just have a different expectation of the tool than what it was built for
[11:50:13] <johnbender> they are consistent with teh concept of idempotent actions on vms
[11:50:24] <ryanneufeld> gotcah
[11:50:37] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: they just do a check like the bash script would :)
[11:50:50] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: that's a _central_ issue with config as code imo
[11:50:54] <johnbender> that needs solving
[11:50:55] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it's a matter of where that get's done
[11:51:02] <ryanneufeld> *gets
[11:51:22] <ryanneufeld> I think I have enough to be dangerous
[11:51:25] <johnbender> :)
[11:51:30] <johnbender> just the right amount then
[11:51:36] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: how have you found it so far?
[11:51:40] <ryanneufeld> <3
[11:51:44] <johnbender> not too much trouble since I haven't heard back
[11:51:44] <johnbender> good
[11:51:48] <johnbender> life changing shit imo
[11:51:52] <ryanneufeld> indeed
[11:52:01] <ryanneufeld> I'm converting my web server at home to use it
[11:52:07] <johnbender> this may sound like crazy talk but IMO in 5 years no one will be doing server dev without vms
[11:52:10] <ryanneufeld> and removing a physical machine
[11:52:20] <ryanneufeld> I don't know about that
[11:52:23] <ryanneufeld> but who knows
[11:52:33] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: the vm management core is abstracted
[11:52:33] <ryanneufeld> I know moz has a bunch of bare metal machines
[11:52:44] <ryanneufeld> the vms just can't handle theload
[11:52:44] <johnbender> mitchell is working on getting vmware and other providers set up
[11:52:56] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: sorry let me clarify
[11:53:04] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I don't mean hosting or running prod vms on it
[11:53:11] <ryanneufeld> oh?
[11:53:12] <johnbender> just purely in the dev environment
[11:53:14] <ryanneufeld> oh
[11:53:14] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:53:16] <ryanneufeld> I will be
[11:53:19] <ryanneufeld> for shizzle
[11:53:24] <johnbender> which is what the tool was designed for
[11:53:40] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:53:41] <johnbender> especially for those of us with hard drive ocd
[11:53:54] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: it was never meant to be a cluster management tool
[11:53:57] <ryanneufeld> I'm about ready for a wipe
[11:53:58] <johnbender> it's a dev tool
[11:54:16] <ryanneufeld> yeah, but it can be used for that, and has the potential to be used that way
[11:54:19] <ryanneufeld> don't you think?
[11:54:23] <johnbender> yep
[11:54:33] <johnbender> and there will be adapters
[11:54:57] <johnbender> but my assertion applys only to development
[11:55:05] <ryanneufeld> indeed
[11:55:11] <ryanneufeld> I wish I had this 2yrs ago
[11:56:37] <johnbender> gseguin: ^^
[11:57:43] <ryanneufeld> two of my co-workers are using ubuntu vms I configed for them
[11:57:45] <ryanneufeld> and it was a PITA
[11:58:02] <ryanneufeld> and they like to futz with them. This would make it SO easy to fix
[11:58:19] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: yep. It's great for less technical resources like designers too
[11:58:21] <ryanneufeld> just vagrant destroy && vagrant up <3++
[11:58:30] <ryanneufeld> one is our css dev
[11:58:32] <ryanneufeld> one is a php dev
[11:58:34] <johnbender> bingo
[11:58:55] <ryanneufeld> who realy has no excuse for not knowing some shell stuff, but he's a tool (in a good way)
[11:59:02] <johnbender> hahah
[12:00:38] <ryanneufeld> well, he's not curious, but he will do anything you give him
[12:00:56] <ryanneufeld> guy does php, ios, and windows dev
[12:01:04] <ryanneufeld> also worked on stuff for nokia
[12:01:11] <ryanneufeld> so he's been useful
[12:01:22] <ryanneufeld> and he's not an a-hole, so that's a plus
[12:01:24] <ryanneufeld> lol
[12:01:33] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: definitely lol
[12:01:52] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: that's worth puting on your gravestone "He wasn't an a-hole"
[12:02:11] <ryanneufeld> I plan on having "That's not what I meant" on mine
[12:02:45] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: very cryptic, I like it :)
[12:02:56] <ryanneufeld> anyone who knows me would get it
[12:02:57] <ryanneufeld> lol
[12:03:36] <ryanneufeld> the filter between my brain and mouth often has large holes, so things come out wrong, when I'm trying to be nice, and it goes horribly wrong
[12:03:54] <ryanneufeld> ask me about 'The Onion Story' sometime

[12:48:48] <Wilto> Maybe I kid. Who knows.
[13:22:46] <gnarf> I dropped out

[13:48:48] <todd_> ah, so it's on the new server? sweet.
[13:48:56] <gseguin> yup
[13:49:06] <todd_> johnbender: I like that you says stuff like this - "breaks the concept of idempotency in provisioning scripts"
[13:49:38] <johnbender> todd_: it's just fance words for "same result when you run it twice"
[13:49:43] <johnbender> *fancy
[13:51:43] <Wilto> I think I understood the word “scripts” in that sentence, and even then: not well.
[13:52:31] <johnbender> it'd be better to use the straight forward terminology, though when you talk about idempotence in the context of provisioning/devops people know just what you mean

[14:15:00] <Wilto> ’Course, agcolom.
[14:15:37] <agcolom> Sorry if this makes no sense at all... I was wondering whether the network speed could be added as a valid use case?
[14:16:37] <agcolom> (I had no internet for 2 weeks or so, so sorry if that was discussed... I've not had time to catch up with everything yet...)
[14:17:26] <johnbender> agcolom: I think that's nearly impossible for browsers to determine on a server by server basis
[14:17:29] <johnbender> though I could be wrong
[14:17:32] <agcolom> or some sort of setting by the user (low res for example to decrease cost/download time)
[14:17:44] <johnbender> that on the other hand is possible :)

[14:19:36] <Wilto> We don’t make mention of how that plays with `srcset`, though. I wrote it up in http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/2012/06/18/florians-compromise/ , but it’s not really codified anywhere.
[14:20:54] <Wilto> The main idea is that the browser is ideally suited to make bandwidth-based asset loading determinations—leaving it in the hands of authors would add a potential point of failure, where we’re selectively applying the information the UA has at-hand.
[14:21:30] <Wilto> I do want to have it down in the proposal that the UA should offer users a choice—opt into “download as bandwidth permits,” “always download low res,” etc.
[14:21:53] <agcolom> yes, that'd be really good I think.
[14:22:02] <Wilto> Speaking as someone on a Retina display that uses a lot of tethering: to not account for this would be pretty brutal.
[14:22:35] <Wilto> Of course, to serve “Retina” images to everyone indiscriminately is completely untenable.
[14:22:44] <Wilto> blah blah in summary vote for me this november
[14:23:02] <agcolom> bradband providers would love that!
[14:23:10] <Wilto> Ain’t that the truth.
[14:23:37] <agcolom> ok, so when should I approve? just let me know ;-)
[14:24:23] <Wilto> But, the millions of people who’ve only ever known the web by way of feature phones and pay-per-kilobyte connections—the people that even now have to dodge websites that they know to be heavy—we’re taking access away from them for the sake of a privileged few getting prettier photos.
[14:24:34] <Wilto> …Not that I’ve written about this a lot. Sorry guys; flooded the channel.
[14:26:26] <Wilto> agcolom: If you know anyone what builds browsers, point ’em my way. We need prototypes.
[14:27:40] <agcolom> Wilto: under 3.3 Source element permitted attributes I'd add a '.' so "type = MIME type The type of the media resource..." would be "type = MIME type. The type of the media resource" (and the same for all the definitions here... ???
[14:27:50] <agcolom> I have contacts at Mozilla
[14:28:18] <Wilto> Mozilla has been oddly silent on this stuff, even after I pinged some folks.
[14:29:18] <agcolom> Wilto: Have you tried Christian Heilmann (I can send him some stuff if you want)
[14:29:41] <Wilto> Yeah, he never got back to me.
[14:30:12] <Wilto> Though he _has_ retweeted a couple of things about `picture`. Not that I search Twitter for “responsive images” constantly, like some sort of crazy person.

[14:44:06] <johnbender> it's taking up a lot of HD space and there's no value
[14:44:20] <Wilto> Not even sentimental?
[14:44:38] <todd_> here i am
[14:45:20] <johnbender> todd_: we had this discussion a long time ago with jresig on the line

[14:46:01] <johnbender> gnarf: we can kill the job and the folder

[14:46:18] <todd_> the branches and /test/ are the important previews we need
[14:46:30] <todd_> johnbender: nowhere i know of
[14:46:34] <johnbender> kk
[14:46:37] <todd_> maybe a few issues?
[14:48:04] <Wilto> I’m not sure I knew they existed, if we’re being honest.
[15:04:17] <todd_> heading home…anyone need anything?
[15:04:26] <todd_> nice quiet beta release. i like that
[15:04:32] <todd_> rc next week me hopes
