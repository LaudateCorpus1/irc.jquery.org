[07:18:34] <bender> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: do you guys have your deploy's set up to automatically update that index? I'm just wondering if I can steal the snippet that does for our deploy
[07:18:47] <bender> s/deploy's/deploys/
[07:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> bender: No, I do it manually.
[07:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: ^
[07:28:55] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: alright, good to know
[07:29:41] <scott_gonzalez> I think it'd be really tricky to automate unless it was backed by some other data source.
[07:30:02] <Wilto> Morning, jQuery Mobros.
[08:31:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/J7t0bg
[08:31:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] updated the docs to link to the new @filamentgroup repo for  fixed toolbar legacy support - scottjehl
[09:52:19] <Wilto> gseguin: Ping, whenever you have a sec.
[10:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker_ johnbender gseguin Wilto: BrowserStack just added mobile emulators.
[10:03:20] <Wilto> Ooh.
[10:04:16] <Wilto> scott_gonzalez: Can’t beat the real thing, but that’ll be handy when away from the lab.
[10:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they've got a decent amount too.
[10:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> Not very wide coverage, but pretty deep.
[10:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> The number of android emulators is pretty impressive.
[10:06:49] <Wilto> I don’t know if I could handle testing on an emulated Android. The only thing that keeps my sanity intact while dealing with one of those things is the thought that I could, in theory, smash it to bits on my desk.
[10:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[10:07:15] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: that's awesome! thanks for the info
[10:07:25] <gseguin> Wilto: 'sup?
[10:08:11] <Wilto> gseguin: You cool with me kicking the download builder over to you, as it stands now? How’s your schedule lookin’?
[10:08:36] <Wilto> I keep getting sidetracked by bugs and such, and it probably makes more sense to have it in your hands since you’re doin’ the API bid’ness.
[10:09:09] <Wilto> Why I type as though I’m scripting a cartoon farmer, I’ll never know.
[10:09:10] <gseguin> Wilto: the thing is I'm worthless for UI design
[10:09:41] <Wilto> Oh, no worries there. If you just wanna get it up and functional and grouped properly, you can kick it back my way to make it oh-so-pretty.
[10:10:01] <gseguin> works for me
[10:10:12] <gseguin> I'm on jQM on Wed and Thurs
[10:10:13] <Wilto> Sweet. Did I chuck that in a gist for you the other day?
[10:10:39] <gseguin> you gave me the script indeed but not the html it lives in
[10:11:04] <Wilto> Ah. Just a hollowed-out blog post page. One sec…
[10:11:23] <gseguin> can you attach it to the same gist?
[10:11:31] <Wilto> Yes indeed.
[10:12:59] <Wilto> gseguin: https://gist.github.com/1996704
[10:13:32] <Wilto> Again, the builder script is pretty messy. Feel free to run roughshod over that sucker.
[10:14:07] <gseguin> starred
[10:14:26] <gseguin> I'll work on making the CSS bundle builder work
[10:14:34] <gseguin> and then I'll get to the ui
[10:17:46] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/goteamventure.gif
[10:18:11] <Wilto> Oh, for the CSS part—what’s the plan there?
[10:19:24] <gseguin> use the bundle api with a .css filename
[10:20:02] <gseguin> with the same parameters + a baseCss (or something like that)
[10:20:30] <gseguin> from there I'll build the dependency map for all the included files
[10:21:07] <gseguin> and walk through the dependency map and look for css files with the same name in the baseCss path
[10:21:36] <gseguin> if I find it I append it to the bundle
[10:22:17] <gseguin> is that insane? I'm totally opened to ideas there
[10:40:24] <Wilto> I dunno; I have a pretty high threshold for insanity. Seems reasonable enough to me.
[10:40:42] <Wilto> Better than handling the list of CSS dependencies manually, that’s for damn sure.
[11:06:38] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #883: FAILURE in 24 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/883/
[11:15:00] <jzaefferer> Did someone mention that BrowserSack now supports mobile browsers?
[11:15:20] <johnbender> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez did
[11:15:22] <johnbender> exciting
[11:16:11] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: That's so last hour :-P
[11:16:25] <jzaefferer> I just tested a local app over their tunnel on an Android 2.2 emulator. Runs as fast or even faster as locally, much much less time involved to get it running.
[11:35:37] <kinblas> man what changed with the jquery forums ... I'm getting flood of emails now
[11:39:27] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure what's up with that. It's really annoying though.
[11:40:53] <jzaefferer> its the same emails over and over again, isn't it?
[11:45:30] <kinblas> not sure, but I'm getting a flood every few minutes
[11:45:45] <kinblas> the sender is different, and each subject is prefixed by some magic number
[11:46:40] <kinblas> ... I meant the sender is not the same as it used to be, it's something like m2f@zohodiscussions.com now
[12:08:56] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[12:08:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #884: FIXED in 27 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/884/
[12:09:17] <johnbender> sigh, our selenium builds have gotten _way_ less stable in the last week or so
[12:09:23] <johnbender> all in Nav too :( :(
[12:19:19] <jzaefferer> johnbender: time to get this testswarm-browserstack running...
[12:20:01] <johnbender> jzaefferer: look, no one wants to do that more than I do
[12:20:30] <johnbender> we're just kind of scrambling to address the rc issues right now
[12:21:21] <johnbender> jzaefferer: maybe tomorrow I can just eat the overhead and set up all the urls manually until I get suite aggregator setup
[12:21:52] <jzaefferer> Its just a one-time job anyway
[12:22:00] <jzaefferer> They shouldn't change that often
[12:22:02] <johnbender> jzaefferer: until we add pages
[12:22:09] <jzaefferer> And you can copy jobs for branches
[12:22:10] <johnbender> we add modules and pages fairly frequently
[12:22:57] <johnbender> still something is better than nothing
[12:24:15] <jzaefferer> what pages?
[12:24:22] <johnbender> jzaefferer: test pages
[12:26:15] <jzaefferer> Can't be that often. Adding another one is pretty quick in Jenkins
[12:26:44] <johnbender> jzaefferer: it's often enough that I created a glob for our test suite runner and for our selenium tests
[12:27:15] <jzaefferer> Sure, but better to add manually now then do it right in the far far future :-)
[12:27:47] <johnbender> jzaefferer: that's exactly what I'm saying -> "maybe tomorrow I can just eat the overhead and set up all the urls manually until I get suite aggregator setup"
[12:48:25] <toddparker> Hey guys
[12:48:32] <toddparker> I've been getting those forum emails today too
[12:48:41] <toddparker> that is such a junk system
[12:49:17] <toddparker> so Wilto is looking at the android select menu issue again
[12:49:34] <toddparker> that is pretty bad…if you use fixed toolbars, our selects break on 2.3
[12:49:43] <toddparker> android is such a freaky browser
[12:53:13] <Wilto> This is familiar freaky, at least.
[13:06:26] <toddparker> scott_gonzalez: Just saw your tweet re: the CDN listing page.
[13:06:44] <toddparker> I don't think Bender and I are are set up to edit that
[13:06:59] <toddparker> who should I ping?
[13:15:06] <johnbender> toddparker: I can push files to the cdn
[13:15:15] <johnbender> so it should be a matter of pulling down and altering and pushing it back up
[13:15:37] <johnbender> though that would flatten other people's changes if there's an overlap
[13:16:03] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm going to add reminder/check in the deploy build target
[13:16:20] <johnbender> so at the very least whoever's deploying will know
[13:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: That's what I do. It's unlikely that we'll be doing releases at the exact same time :-)
[13:18:26] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: extremely unlikely :D
[13:23:41] <toddparker> ok, cool. didn't know if that was on a CMS or something high the like that
[13:24:10] <toddparker> so we basically pull that sucker down, don't test, then push it up? my kind of dev. like it.
[13:24:33] <Wilto> oh god what did I just walk into
[13:25:07] <toddparker> how code.jquery.com is updated
[13:25:25] <Wilto> Ah.
[13:25:33] <Wilto> “Elves,” I’ve assumed.
[13:34:19] <Wilto> Tacit agreement, I see. Good, good.
[14:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, toddmparker_ you actually can test locally, since it's just a list of links to stuff that already exists.
[14:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> But that doesn't stop me from doing my edits live on the server :-P
[14:43:03] <toddparker> heh. true though. these are all can links so testing is easy.

[14:44:41] <toddparker> http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=12332
[14:44:53] <toddparker> Android is a poo head
[15:20:04] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: I've added you guys on the phonegap build
[15:20:11] <johnbender> I'm going to set that up to be once a day
[15:20:26] <johnbender> and I have to ping them about why the blackberry build isn't working with the tar
[16:00:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you guys have an apple dev key?
[16:00:53] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we need one to do ios builds of the phonegap kitchen sink application
