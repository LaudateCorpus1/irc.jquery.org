[06:58:44] <toddparker> gseguin and johnbender - give me a shout when you want to discuss how we should implement that proposed fix for the slow/crashy performance with long pages
[06:58:54] <toddparker> i'll me in a meeting but can type on the sly :)
[06:59:22] <toddparker> See issue with comments - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4340#issuecomment-6494740
[06:59:23] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4340 on jquery-mobile (mruffolo; 1m, 1w ago): slow response when clicking item in large listview on mobile devices
[07:00:30] <toddparker> in a nut, we shouldn't add a feature or behavior change on a maintenance release but with the new transition approach, if you're scrolled down on a long page, it can really degrade performance
[07:01:06] <toddparker> Since 1.1.0 *crashes* the best iOS devices on that list view perf page, think we need to do something
[08:50:35] <gseguin> good morning
[08:53:47] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm fine with what you've proposed as long as we provide a switch
[08:55:25] <johnbend1r> gseguin: ^
[08:56:30] <gseguin> catching up with your comment
[08:56:52] <gseguin> with todd's comment
[09:38:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: did we chat about preserving the stack management in a branch?
[09:42:15] <gseguin> ?tell toddparker: I applied both patches suggested in that ticket and it's much faster on iPad3 and does not crash though it I could not get it to crash before applying scott's patch either
[09:42:15] <bot-t> gseguin, Okay.

[13:04:39] <todd__> hi all
[13:04:48] <todd__> what did i miss
[13:21:22] <todd__> johnbender: you here?
[13:28:37] <gseguin> todd__: I applied both patches suggested in that ticket and it's much faster on iPad3 and does not crash though it I could not get it to crash before applying scott's patch either
[13:43:43] <todd__> yeah? Interesting.
[13:44:11] <todd__> I only applied the first one and it was still crashy
[13:44:50] <todd__> I'm on board with landing these tweaks if they check out
[13:44:58] <todd__> doing less is always a good thing gseguin
[13:45:26] <gseguin> so you're not too concern about the hover state not being reset ?
[13:47:12] <gseguin> todd__: ^
[13:53:52] <agcolom> Hi todd__, hi gseguin :-)
[13:54:08] <gseguin> hey agcolom
[13:54:53] <agcolom> How are you?
[13:55:41] <gseguin> doing good, you?
[13:57:44] <agcolom> exhausted! end of the week ;-) so I can sleep tomorrow morning :-) I had a mad day yesterday with tons of crazy things happening all day! But all seems back to normal today, so I'm happy  ;-)
[13:57:53] <johnbender> todd__: here
[13:58:31] <gseguin> oh lucky you! you can sleep in on weekends
[13:58:52] <gseguin> my kids yet have to learn that weekend thing, working on it
[13:59:26] <agcolom> btw mac book pros are very robust. Mine survived a power surge / power spike ??? yesterday!
[13:59:35] <agcolom> yes my kids are well trained on that one!
[14:00:05] <agcolom> but week days I'm up at 6.45am :-( for Amelie's school... it's too early!
[14:00:45] <gseguin> that would be sleeping in for me
[14:01:21] <agcolom> oh, sorry... but I go to bed too late... something to do with timezone and people in the USA... ;-)
[14:04:36] <agcolom> Guys btw I'm very jealous of all of you meeting up in SF next week! If anyone can grab a girl t-shirt (size small/medium) for me, you'd make me VERY HAPPY ;-)
[14:05:35] <agcolom> todd__ nice work on the new docs stage site...
[14:08:42] <agcolom> todd__ you had a doc with devices owned by Filament Group or jQuery... would you like to add devices owned by us, not necessarily to make public but to know who to ask for testing specific things on specific devices/os ?
[14:16:57] <agcolom> Can I have someone's opinion on something on this page: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/checkboxes/ ?
[14:18:00] <gseguin> what about it ?
[14:18:08] <agcolom> the 1st example
[14:18:51] <gseguin> is it on purpose that it's there twice ?
[14:18:58] <agcolom> (code) the 1st checkbox is checkbox-1 and the 2nd one is checkbox-0
[14:19:31] <agcolom> I think it's to demo that you can either do <label><input type=checkbox></label>
[14:19:51] <agcolom> or <label for (id of input)><input id...>
[14:20:36] <agcolom> now I'm not a fan of that particular example, because it is not clear to me what it is trying to show.
[14:20:52] <gseguin> agreed, it
[14:20:59] <agcolom> so either we say you can do this using this or that and they are both identical
[14:21:14] <gseguin> 's confusing if there is no explaination as to why there are 2 of them
[14:21:21] <agcolom> or we have an example showing 2 separate checkboxes and then they cannot be saying the same thing
[14:21:51] <gseguin> like maybe put the quote text right above the button
[14:21:52] <agcolom> I'm not the one who this this, so I am not sure what the idea was.
[14:22:09] <gseguin> don't know either
[14:22:32] <agcolom> would it be scottjehl maybe or todd__?
[14:22:50] <gseguin> most likely
[14:24:19] <agcolom> in other widgets, the ids and names were not consistent, so I'm trying to apply consistency there as well and ensure unique ids are used throughout... is it ok to start from say slider-1 for slider examples (and not slider-0) or is it best to start from slider-0?
[14:24:35] <agcolom> (I was thinking example 1 - slider-1)
[14:25:25] <agcolom> (i.e. as a developer, if you name elements, would you name them from element-1 or element-0)?
[14:25:42] <gseguin> element-0 as a dev
[14:26:20] <agcolom> ok, so would be best to do that for the docs as well then... ??
[14:27:26] <agcolom> (it's not a problem to change it... it's minor changes to 4 or 5 pages, and then I can stop worrying about and wondering which is best)
[14:59:13] <agcolom> Goodnight...
[15:00:15] <johnbender> todd__: given that change should we do a beta before an RC?
[15:00:27] <johnbender> keep in mind I don't know what code got taken out/altered
[15:00:30] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[15:00:32] <johnbender> same question to you
[15:01:54] <gseguin> johnbender: I feel confortable with RC
[15:08:10] <johnbender> kk
[16:16:12] <Wilto> I took out a bunch of code earlier today, just a heads-up.
[16:16:29] <Wilto> Just went and deleted a bunch of files haphazardly. “Code weight” and all.
[17:29:28] <toddmparker_> hi
[17:29:35] <toddmparker_> anyone here still
[17:29:53] <gseguin> man how many identities does toddmparker_ have?
[17:30:18] <toddmparker_> many, many
[17:30:28] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[17:30:38] <toddmparker_> sorry i dropped off
[17:30:49] <gseguin> no worries
[17:31:04] <gseguin> when are you arriving in California?
[17:31:07] <toddmparker_> so what's the update on the listview slowness
[17:31:18] <toddmparker_> you said both fixes helped?
[17:31:28] <toddmparker_> wed. afternoon
[17:31:32] <gseguin> no real update, I haven't witnessed the crash
[17:31:46] <toddmparker_> no?
[17:31:52] <toddmparker_> impossible!
[17:31:54] <gseguin> nope
[17:32:07] <gseguin> maybe I didn't try hard enough
[17:32:22] <toddmparker_> heh
[17:32:29] <toddmparker_> if you go here
[17:32:30] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-performance.html
[17:32:44] <toddmparker_> scroll to the bottom and click = no crash?
[17:33:50] <gseguin> trying on my charged ipod touch
[17:33:58] <toddmparker_> k
[17:34:03] <toddmparker_> ios5?
[17:34:33] <gseguin> ah yes kaboom
[17:34:41] <gseguin> I was trying on the iPad
[17:34:50] <gseguin> and wasn't scrolling all the way down
[17:35:12] <toddmparker_> kaboom
[17:35:17] <toddmparker_> yeah
[17:35:17] <gseguin> I'll try with that fix and if it doesn't crash anymore I'll push the patch
[17:35:23] <toddmparker_> ok
[17:35:42] <gseguin> wrapping up Jive tasks first
[17:35:45] <toddmparker_> i found the 1st one helped a bit was still very slow@bottom
[17:35:54] <toddmparker_> turn off page transitions
[17:35:58] <toddmparker_> = no crash
[17:36:03] <toddmparker_> k
[17:40:59] <toddmparker_> w/no transitions, its fast and fine
[17:41:26] <gseguin> that's what the second part of the fix does, right?
[17:41:29] <toddmparker_> thats why we were thinking that nixing trx on long pages might be smart
[17:43:01] <gseguin> should be a parameter though so it can be tweaked
[17:43:09] <gseguin> don't you think?
[17:53:54] <toddmparker_> yeah, think so
[17:54:48] <toddmparker_> so the second fix is scott's suggestion in the comment from yesterday to skip transitions if you're scrolled down X - right gseguin
[17:55:02] <gseguin> indeed
[17:55:06] <gseguin> the one in the last comment
[17:55:23] <toddmparker_> cool
[17:55:32] <toddmparker_> wasn't sure if there was another fixe
[17:56:34] <toddmparker_> scott has suggested a tighter scope in that that thread too
[17:56:52] <gseguin> ok, I'll look at the comment
[17:56:58] <toddmparker_> but the #1 issue is the transitions. the other things are red herrings
[17:57:28] <toddmparker_> i mean, we can certainly improve some perf with less code or tighter scopes
[17:57:47] <toddmparker_> but it seems like transitions are the big culprit here
[17:57:58] <toddmparker_> tho i wonder if this is just an ios issue
[17:58:18] <toddmparker_> does that page crash your android?
[17:58:26] * gseguin tries
[17:58:28] <toddmparker_> it was ok on my kindle fire
[17:59:17] <toddmparker_> think it's now iOS renders the page - it must rasterize the full page UP from your scroll position and animate that whole thing during transitions
[17:59:52] <toddmparker_> that explains why it's ok when scrolled just a bit - BELOW isn't in memory the same way somehow
[18:00:21] <gseguin> I get an "unresponsive script" dialog
[18:00:25] <gseguin> but it doesn't crash
[18:00:26] <toddmparker_> meant to test android 2.3 vs. 4 today - they have very different rendering models
[18:00:32] <toddmparker_> ah, good
[18:00:51] <toddmparker_> means it's a broader issue - maybe all webkit has this issue
[18:01:09] <toddmparker_> but if you set page trx to "none" - it's ok right gseguin
[18:01:33] <gseguin> haven't tried
[18:02:04] <toddmparker_> ah, change it and you'll be shocked
[18:02:10] <toddmparker_> zippy
[18:02:42] <toddmparker_> took 25 seconds to switch pages on ipad scrolled 3/4 down
[18:02:52] <toddmparker_> w/none >> 1-2 seconds!
[18:05:24] <gseguin> it is much faster indeed
[18:05:30] <gseguin> and no unresponsive script
[18:09:38] <toddmparker_> yep
[18:09:41] <toddmparker_> odd huh
[18:09:53] <toddmparker_> scott figured it out
[18:10:08] <toddmparker_> makes sense - only thing that is really different in 1.1
[18:10:12] <toddmparker_> 1.0 was fast
[18:10:27] <gseguin> once again, props to scottjehl !
[18:10:31] <toddmparker_> heh
[18:10:41] <toddmparker_> so are you convinced?
[18:10:54] <toddmparker_> wondering what you think is the best thing to do for 1.1.1
[18:11:15] <toddmparker_> make an option for this scroll threshold?
[18:11:48] <gseguin> yeah
[18:13:41] <gseguin> what name though?
[18:13:44] <toddmparker_> i know we don't normally want to change things for this type of release but this is a baddie
[18:14:06] <toddmparker_> i had suggested one in my comment
[18:14:12] <toddmparker_> prolly not too good
[18:14:33] <toddmparker_> but was trying to key off the screen width option we already have
[18:14:44] <gseguin> I'll try to come up with one
[18:14:48] <toddmparker_> since this is similar but for scroll offset
[18:14:56] <toddmparker_> i trust you will rokk it
[18:14:58] <toddmparker_> :)
[18:15:17] <toddmparker_> we used 3x device height but we can do whatever makes sesse
[18:15:19] <toddmparker_> sense
[18:15:31] <toddmparker_> could be a px value if that's simpler for an option
[18:15:46] <toddmparker_> ~1,000-2,00 seems good
[18:16:00] <gseguin> I like it relative to the device screen height
[18:16:04] <toddmparker_> we can tweak the default
[18:16:09] <toddmparker_> yeah, it is kinda cool
[18:16:19] <toddmparker_> just wondering how the option would look
[18:17:06] <gseguin> like $.mobile.maxHeightForTransitions
[18:17:40] <gseguin> maxPageHeightForTransitions
[18:17:46] <toddmparker_> it's actually scroll offset
[18:18:04] <gseguin> silly me
[18:18:05] <toddmparker_> oddly, you can trx to a 10,000 tall page
[18:18:09] <gseguin> yeah
[18:18:17] <toddmparker_> but not that same page scrolled down
[18:18:19] <toddmparker_> fun.
[18:19:13] <gseguin> maxScrollTopForTransition
[18:20:12] <toddmparker_> so we have maxTransitionWidth
[18:20:21] <toddmparker_> maxTransitionScrollOffset
[18:20:47] <toddmparker_> since the first sets trx to none on widths wider than X
[18:21:07] <toddmparker_> maxTransitionScrollDist
[18:21:10] <toddmparker_> maxTransitionScroll
[18:21:44] <toddmparker_> not as descriptive but maybe consistent?
[18:21:49] <gseguin> maxScrollForTransiion ?
[18:22:13] <toddmparker_> that is clearer
[18:22:29] <gseguin> sold
[18:22:36] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[18:22:53] <toddmparker_> just realized it's late for you
[18:23:03] <toddmparker_> don't let me hold you up
[18:23:21] <gseguin> I'll do that at home
[18:23:57] <toddmparker_> heh, ok
[18:24:14] <toddmparker_> i just promised bender i'd follow up today. course he dodged the bullet
[18:24:28] <toddmparker_> this is such a bad issue, good to know we have a plan
[22:12:59] <gseguin> toddmparker_: what happens when the user resize?
[22:13:15] <johnbender> gseguin: toddmparker_ I'm around to dive in front of the bullet if necessary
[22:13:30] <gseguin> hey johnbender
[22:13:46] <johnbender> just readings some papers for my 3PM MEETING WITH A STANFORD PROFESSOR ON THE 28TH!
[22:13:47] <gseguin> so I was implementing what we talked about with Todd
[22:13:51] <johnbender> :D
[22:13:54] <johnbender> ah cool
[22:13:57] <johnbender> constant?
[22:13:59] <gseguin> oh nice
[22:14:00] <johnbender> function?
[22:14:03] <gseguin> congrats
[22:14:05] <johnbender> thanks
[22:14:07] <johnbender> I'm excited
[22:14:14] <johnbender> I'm a big fan of his work too
[22:14:20] <gseguin> yeah the more I think about it the more I want to make it a function
[22:14:30] <johnbender> yep
[22:14:31] <johnbender> callback
[22:14:34] <johnbender> to do that calculation
[22:14:41] <johnbender> then people can do whatever the hell they want
[22:15:02] <gseguin> so it'll be $.mobile.getMaxScrollForTransition
[22:15:14] <johnbender> that also gives us the opportunity to collect alternate implementations
[22:15:17] <gseguin> works for you?
[22:15:20] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[22:15:33] <johnbender> there's a part of me that wants to start namespacing nav config
[22:15:45] <johnbender> because there are one hundred billion config options for nav
[22:15:52] <johnbender> but I realize it's bad timing
[22:16:50] <gseguin> I know
[22:16:57] <gseguin> but yeah, bad timing
[22:17:26] <johnbender> maybe for 1.3 we can clean all that crap up
[22:17:32] <johnbender> deprecation is easy
[22:18:01] <johnbender> you can just do an internal method that ||'s the values
[22:18:14] <gseguin> agreed
[22:20:19] <gseguin> Alright, I'm doing it!
[22:21:23] <johnbender> gseguin: word
[22:21:49] <johnbender> spent most of today cleaning up my preso for next Friday
[22:22:08] <johnbender> the second half was seriously rushed
[22:22:18] * johnbender is depressed that he needs 4 days to put together a good presentation
[22:29:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/H_O8tg
[22:29:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Moved getScreenHeight to core - Ghislain Seguin
[22:29:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Fixes #4340 - Ghislain Seguin
[22:29:28] <gseguin> hey it takes me a week to write an internal blog post, so you're not too bad
[22:30:38] <gseguin> alright it's in
[22:31:05] <gseguin> toddmparker_: if you can give it a try, my ipod touch is at work
[22:31:30] <johnbender> gseguin: my blog posts take a week +
[22:31:44] <johnbender> I'm so concerened with people's perceptions of my writing
[22:31:50] <johnbender> especially after a few early blunders
