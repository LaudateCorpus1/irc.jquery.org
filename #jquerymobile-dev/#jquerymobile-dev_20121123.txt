[02:54:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Morning!
[02:55:32] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ goodmorning
[03:19:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The fix for the theme toggling: $el.page( "option", "theme", this.options.overlayTheme ); during dialog's _create()
[03:23:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I have to give this a closer look to get the full picture
[03:25:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The page was setting the theme on the body from it's own this.options.theme - which was set to "c", but it needs to be set to dialog's this.options.overlayTheme, because that's the dialog's equivalent of theme.
[03:25:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... in terms of what ends up set on the body.
[03:26:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just looked at the code and get it now
[03:26:06] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Old build #86: STILL FAILING in 1 hr 19 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/86/
[03:26:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see there is logic for setting the theme on the body when you transition from page to page, but not for from page to dialog
[03:28:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so your solution sounds good to me
[03:29:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I put a breakpoint in page's removeContainerBackground() and setContainerBackground() and it gets hit during transition to a dialog.
[03:29:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but I did break a unit test. I might have to refine my solution.
[04:29:59] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: are you interested in extending the Jenkins TestSwarm job(s)? Seems like johnbender is too busy with other stuff. We've got support for mobile browsers now!
[04:30:09] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: I can support as needed

[12:45:36] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14dd06e3e 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: first version of pageremove event
[13:00:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It turns out that the problem was that handlers were being attached to the page div using .bind() and so they were not detached during _destroy(), so when the page and dialog widgets were being reinstantiated on the page div, there were now two event handlers.
[13:00:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The fix is indeed more subtle than just setting the theme on the page div.

[13:31:57] <ryanneufeld> is this a bug? http://cl.ly/image/2b1x392I3r3J
[13:32:06] <ryanneufeld> checkout the corners
[13:49:26] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I dunno, really. What does it look like with 1.2.0?
[13:49:39] <ryanneufeld> that is 1.2.0
[13:49:44] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Aaah, OK.
[13:50:39] <ryanneufeld> it's like the inner part is getting a different radius than the outer
[13:50:41] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I wonder if that's what it looks like at normal zoom level.
[13:50:44] <ryanneufeld> but every other button is fine
[13:50:46] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Yeah ...
[13:50:46] <ryanneufeld> it's the same
[13:51:03] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: What do you mean every other button is fine?
[13:51:31] <ryanneufeld> like collapsibles
[13:51:33] <ryanneufeld> look fine
[13:51:41] <ryanneufeld> http://cl.ly/image/0G1G2n3H101U
[13:51:44] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: So, how did you create those buttons?
[13:51:58] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I mean, what was the HTML?
[13:52:01] <ryanneufeld> se
[13:52:03] <ryanneufeld> c
[13:52:19] <_|Nix|_> That does indeed look buggy.

[13:53:59] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Is it OK if I make a jsbin out of that?
[13:54:08] <ryanneufeld> yup
[13:54:42] <_|Nix|_> data-theme="m"?
[13:54:48] <ryanneufeld> custom theme
[13:55:32] <ryanneufeld> updated my gist with our mobile.css
[13:58:31] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I would suggest that it might be your custom swatches. I changed the swatches to "b" and they look OK: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/537/
[13:59:32] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:59:37] <ryanneufeld> Thanks _|Nix|_
[14:00:23] <ryanneufeld> I added our css
[14:00:30] <ryanneufeld> any idea what part of it would be causing that?
[14:01:16] <ryanneufeld> nvm
[14:01:17] <ryanneufeld> found it

[18:55:52] <gnarf> Krinkle: I why change from _REQUEST to _GET ?
[18:56:10] <Krinkle> Because _REQUEST also contains _POST and _COOKIE
[18:56:17] <Krinkle> and the form is only used with method=get
[18:56:33] <gnarf> ok - i mean, its a minor change in behavior
[18:56:49] <gnarf> just was curious why you went that way
[18:56:52] <gnarf> i hate _REQUEST
[18:56:53] <gnarf> so +1
[18:56:54] <gnarf> :)
[18:56:56] <Krinkle> :)
[18:57:19] <Krinkle> I'm working on a node script that imports google-code issues to GitHub.
[18:57:29] <Krinkle> there've been a few in the past, but none of them are working anymore.
[18:57:33] <gnarf> I wrote one of those once
[18:57:42] <gnarf> not for google-code
[18:57:46] <gnarf> some other lame tracker we were using 
[18:57:56] <Krinkle> trac :P ?
[19:00:29] <Krinkle> I've got issue importing working, what's left is fixing the labels and comments.

[19:03:29] <Krinkle> Oh and close state, need to do that too
[20:30:27] <Krinkle> gnarf: I've actually been working on this importer for almost a year, its like a low priory background project that I'm doing recursively to create and discover other interesting tools
[20:30:38] <Krinkle> such as node-colorfactory, which I needed to create the labels at github with different colors :)
[20:31:05] <Krinkle> varying colors, as much differtiating with the number of labels available.
[20:31:12] <Krinkle> or rather number of labels to be created.
[20:31:15] <Krinkle> anyhow, fun :D
[20:31:20] <Krinkle> https://github.com/Krinkle/sandbox3/issues
[20:31:34] <Krinkle> it happens to start at red for bug
