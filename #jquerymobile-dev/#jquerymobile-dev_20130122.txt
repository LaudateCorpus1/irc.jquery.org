[04:39:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Funny: ^
[04:39:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the corner styling classes?
[04:39:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am writing comment there now
[04:46:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Beat you to it :)But you're probably able to explain even better.
[04:47:58] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[04:48:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! In the process of fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5465, I uncovered another no-history bug: Page -> dialog1 -> dialog2 <- Close goes back to Page, rather than dialog1 ...
[04:49:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm making a redirect for the sequence tests that turns off history.
[04:49:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|: cool
[04:49:42] <arschmitz> so many different edge case sequences for nav
[04:50:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The words "whole slew" are on the tip of my tongue, but I will not utter them, hoping ...
[04:50:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup :(
[04:50:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im trying to make a list of everywhere we do browser sniffing
[04:51:31] <arschmitz> i know fixedToolbars, panels, support
[04:52:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Popup, I think, too ... there's a variable called androidBlacklist in there somewhere ...
[04:52:56] <arschmitz> ok
[04:53:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im going to add on the the mobile.browser object and just do it all in support
[04:53:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the only thing on that object right now is oldIE lol
[04:53:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You might wanna do something similar to what we do in $.mobile.path - namely, parseUrl()
[04:53:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's a giant regex that splits a URL into its components.
[04:54:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats pretty much exactly what i was going to do
[04:54:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: With that plumbing, you could then address the various uses throughout the library.
[04:54:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe add a method for each use.
[04:54:36] <arschmitz> execpt im just going to do it once and tack onto browser
[04:54:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's great!
[04:54:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, definitely.
[04:55:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Might even wanna do it lazy, like not during library load, but during the first call to the function.
[04:55:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Although the first call will probably be during library load anyway ...
[04:55:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i was going to see where first call ended up and make decision based on that
[04:55:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... so NM :)
[04:55:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... OK.
[04:55:53] <arschmitz> because if its in library load every time no point in lazy load
[04:56:23] <_|Nix|_> *nod*
[04:57:40] <_|Nix|_> Well, I'd say I just piled on another load ... the no-history sequence tests ... only 3 of the 13 pass ...
[04:57:54] <_|Nix|_> ... though the failures may not be mutually orthogonal.
[04:57:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im facing a bit of a delima with the whole nav re work to allow the deeplinks 
[04:58:12] <arschmitz> ouch 3 of 13 not good
[04:58:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you mean?
[04:58:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's a "new" test suite, in the sense that we run the sequence tests in a new environment.
[04:58:59] <arschmitz> well whole genisis of this is toddmpark: wants deeplinking for nav
[04:59:05] <arschmitz> for docs and demos i mean
[04:59:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but the no-hisotry use case is pretty popular AFAICT.
[04:59:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Whaddya mean he wants deeplinking for nav?
[04:59:37] <arschmitz> not nav docs and demos typo
[04:59:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We have deep linking for nav ... just not for dialogs and popups.
[04:59:59] <arschmitz> no im removing that its buggy
[05:00:18] <arschmitz> it needs to be supported in a better and more sane way
[05:00:30] <arschmitz> it messes with history 
[05:00:48] <arschmitz> and requires a query param for going to another page
[05:00:54] <arschmitz> its not good
[05:00:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's supposed to, because you're supposed to be able to close a dialog/popup with the browser's back button.
[05:01:13] <arschmitz> i dont think we are talking about the same thing
[05:01:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's not technically a query param, because it followes the hash.
[05:01:41] <arschmitz> im talking about click on a link to an id and it will scroll to it
[05:01:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh!
[05:01:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[05:02:11] <arschmitz> yeah just like it would work without JQM 
[05:02:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We need a new type of data-rel, I guess, because the default behaviour is to treat an ID as the ID of an internal page.
[05:02:27] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:02:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no 
[05:02:38] <arschmitz> we can make it work just fine with nothing special
[05:02:49] <arschmitz> however the changes to nav are not trivial
[05:03:06] <arschmitz> so i cant put it in master until we get 1.3 final out the door
[05:03:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can have the click handler /not/ preventDefault when handling the click to such a link, and that should work.
[05:03:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thought of that but that messes with history
[05:03:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, that's right ...
[05:04:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: making it work isnt a problem
[05:04:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why is this not confined to the click handler?
[05:04:31] <arschmitz> it is mostly
[05:04:41] <arschmitz> but need to modify the go method on navigate
[05:05:00] <arschmitz> and then set up a new module in navigate to handle the scrolling
[05:05:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: AIUI, the go method is only called when you /intend/ to change history.
[05:05:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:yes this should be tracked in history
[05:05:48] <arschmitz> it is when done native
[05:06:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the only delima i have with it is we need it now to start putting it into demos so we dont have to go back and add to every page
[05:06:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I'm beginning to see what's going on ... you need to teach nav to distinguish between going to/coming from another page and going to/coming from a jump anchor.
[05:06:56] <arschmitz> but its a big enough change i dont think i can do it untill after 1.3
[05:07:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah its pretty easy but i need to change a few things
[05:07:31] <arschmitz> johnbender: and i "hashed" it all out yesterday ha ha ha 
[05:07:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: can never resist a really bad pun lol
[05:08:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think you can do it in changePage, consulting $.mobile.urlHistory (or whatever the new NS is)
[05:08:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Join the club.
[05:08:23] <arschmitz> no im not modify change page at all
[05:08:35] <arschmitz> im using a pagebeforechange handler 
[05:08:50] <arschmitz> if the link is on the same page i scroll and then prevent default
[05:08:56] <arschmitz> or return false
[05:08:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but then you're basically modifying changePage ...
[05:09:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's cleaner in that it's modular, but it's pretty much the same thing.
[05:09:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I handle popup links the same way.
[05:09:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[05:09:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... to avoid having navigation.js depend on popup.js
[05:09:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's a good architecture.
[05:10:27] <arschmitz> and if its a link to another page i save the hash in the pagebeforechange and then on pagechange i scroll and tack the hash back on using the go method
[05:10:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think you might be able to get away with just that handler though, no? Do the scrolling in there.
[05:10:41] <arschmitz> which im modifying to beable to update hash without adding to history
[05:10:57] <arschmitz> yes all scrolling will be in there
[05:11:11] <arschmitz> but need to modify go to allow hash changes with out history
[05:11:37] <arschmitz> and need to modify link binding to have it not mangle the url before it gets to pagebeforechange
[05:11:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just keep in mind the no-pushState case and the no-history case when you do this.
[05:12:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes 
[05:12:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, johnbender and I were talking about moving all URL mangling in one place.
[05:12:50] <arschmitz> right now any link that contains a hash gets all mangled because of dialogs and nested listviews
[05:12:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We do it in so many places ...
[05:13:22] <arschmitz> so im making it to only modify links for those to cases and let anything else pass through normally
[05:14:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: johnbender and i spent a prety fair amount of time working out the best way to do all this yesterday
[05:14:53] <arschmitz> i think we have it pretty good but i dont know what to do about demos until after 1.3
[05:15:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's always 1.3.1 ...
[05:15:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no i mean they need to add this to all the demos page as they make them
[05:15:44] <arschmitz> but it wont work until its in master
[05:15:52] <arschmitz> but i cant put in master untill after 1.3
[05:16:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: see http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/buttons/
[05:17:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ this is going to be on every page
[05:17:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ the jump to section that is
[05:17:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see ... and this is done in the demo code right now?
[05:18:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes i wrote something to make it work as is right now
[05:18:33] <arschmitz> but it works very poorly in my oppinion and requires different markup then what the final way will be
[05:18:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We need to be able to access the panel after the jump-to-section as well,
[05:18:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do I open the panel without scrolling back to the top?
[05:19:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ they are going to make the panel auto close and each section will have a back to top link
[05:19:19] <_|Nix|_> Aaaah. OK.
[05:20:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ do you see my issue now though i dont want them to use wrong markup everywhere and have to update 100 pages
[05:20:28] <arschmitz> and also dont want them to add this to a whole bunch of pages and not have it work until after 1.4
[05:20:31] <arschmitz> 1.3 i mean
[05:21:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: really comes down to poor timing would have been better if i had done this 2 weeks ago so it could just go in 1.3
[05:21:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, might be time to allow One More Feature™
[05:21:48] <arschmitz> Maybe ill check with toddmparker when he jumps on
[05:21:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[05:22:02] <arschmitz> maybe he can really shout it from the rooftops in the next blog post
[05:22:18] <arschmitz> so even though its new we can slide it through
[05:22:27] <_|Nix|_> yeah.
[05:22:45] <arschmitz> it addresses a whole bunch of feature requests lol
[05:23:59] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[05:24:05] <arschmitz> anyway ill let toddmparker: make the decision on this one hes the one that sent me on my quest for this feature in the first place lol
[05:24:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im also going to have it auto generate the panel in the demos based on h2 heading
[05:25:02] <arschmitz> will automaticly grab each h2 and add the link in that panel
[05:25:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... this is beginning to sound like a widget: this.options.headerTags: "h2"
[05:26:13] <arschmitz> also going to have it auto add the back to top link before each h2 exectpt the first one
[05:26:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah probably will be a widget of some sort
[05:27:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sounds like a fair chunk of work ...
[05:29:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah 
[05:29:20] <arschmitz> will be really good though
[05:32:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just realized that the sequence tests are no good for no history because they do a bunch of $.mobile.back()-ing ...
[05:33:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ...
[05:43:08] <arschmitz> ahh yeah 
[05:54:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... another argument in favour of a central method for doing all history manipulation. $.mobile.back() could be modified to branch depending on whether history is on or off ...
[05:54:21] <arschmitz> true
[05:55:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm seriously contemplating moving into a cave with a nuclear battery and a subscription to a pizza service and not coming out until I have some sane nav.
[05:55:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: might be waiting a long while lol
[06:00:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: gah!  Good scene from Stargate SG-1 comes to mind, but I can't find the video ...
[06:02:02] <arschmitz> lol
[06:28:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[06:36:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Found it! http://www.putlocker.com/file/16FF462864D3B65F# and go to abut 21:55 :)
[06:36:24] <arschmitz> lol ill check it out
[06:37:05] <arschmitz> hmm not working for me
[06:37:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It was a longshot anyway ...
[06:37:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... all I had to do was "Continue as free user" and there it was.
[06:38:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... anyway, back to work ...
[06:38:18] <arschmitz> yeah i think i need to update my flash
[06:38:21] <arschmitz> ugh flash
[07:05:36] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender So I got a fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5465, but I found another problem: Start -> page -> dialog1 -> dialog2 <- Close lands on the page instead of dialog1.
[07:05:37] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[08:44:17] <Wilto> Hey _|Nix|_, you did that little “view source” plugin, yeah? Or was that uGoMobi?
[09:14:32] <RWhitbeck> agcolom, toddparker I was chatting with ajpiano yesterday about helping get the new jquerymobile.com content set up.  I got the site all set up locally just need to talk with you two about a game plan.

[13:46:24] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:46:26] <arschmitz> lol
[13:46:49] <arschmitz> too bad it could use a performance bump lol
[13:47:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, that's gonna have to come from somewhere else ...
[13:47:12] <arschmitz> oh got that video to work
[13:47:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looks like I cannot escape my ultimate fate: to nativize custom select ... *crunch* <- that was my head imploding ...
[13:47:22] <arschmitz> stupid windows got on my mac and book works
[13:47:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Excellent.
[13:47:34] <arschmitz> how long will it take?
[13:47:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't dare estimate.
[13:47:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: as long as it takes
[13:48:05] <_|Nix|_> Indeed ...
[13:48:09] <arschmitz> lol that was from your scene
[13:48:17] <_|Nix|_> I know, I know ...
[13:48:40] <arschmitz> i saw a complaint about native methods on custom select
[13:48:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, really? Where?
[13:49:00] <arschmitz> hasAttribute not supported on ie < 8
[13:49:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd love to tack a "Fixes #nnnn" on that mod.
[13:49:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Custom select uses hasAttribute ... lessee ...
[13:49:52] <_|Nix|_> It does indeed ...
[13:49:57] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5506#issuecomment-12525216
[13:50:07] <_|Nix|_> Well, I thought we didn't care about IE < 8 anymore ...
[13:50:26] <arschmitz> no we still support ie7 + at a grade
[13:50:42] <arschmitz> trust me i had to pull my hair out on workaroudns for range to support ie7
[13:51:01] <arschmitz> :(
[13:51:29] <_|Nix|_> Bletch!
[13:51:48] <_|Nix|_> Well, OK :-S let's waste more energy on that abomination ...
[13:52:37] <_|Nix|_> I'm telling you - all those aliens are waiting for M$ to disappear off the face of the planet before making first contact with us ...
[13:52:59] <_|Nix|_> They don't want any malware ...
[13:53:14] <arschmitz> they know we cant possibly be inteligent life couldnt possibly use ie7
[13:53:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, eh?
[13:53:29] <arschmitz> ah mangled two different thoughts there lol
[13:53:41] <arschmitz> but you get the idea lol
[13:53:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In Star Trek, the bar was set at a working warp drive, but IRL I think it's the disappearance of M$ ...
[13:54:12] <arschmitz> lol
[13:54:38] <arschmitz> even just dissappearence of old IE
[13:54:44] <arschmitz> the xbox isnt too bad lol
[13:55:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono! I want payback! The world will be 0.002°C warmer because of old IE!
[13:55:22] <arschmitz> lol
[13:55:34] <arschmitz> that should make you happy in finland lol
[13:55:56] <arschmitz> ( i say that while watching it snow outside )
[13:56:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hell no! Nothing beats -15°C ... no slush, no mud, just ice, snow, and dry pavement.
[13:56:17] <arschmitz> lol
[13:57:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In that sense, Jan and Feb are the best months ... we get lots of arctic high pressure, so lots of sunshine, albeit at cryogenic temperatures :)
[13:57:55] <arschmitz> lol we have been having crazy un seasonable swings here
[13:58:02] <arschmitz> 50 one day and 5 the next
[13:58:21] <arschmitz> (ferinheight of course)
[13:59:22] <arschmitz> so what like -15°C - 10°C
[13:59:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I had a colleague back in Calgary when I was doing my M.Sc. who hated the cold. For him, +25°C was a bit chilly. He gave a presentation in Texas about some ... I forget exactly, but nanokelvins were involved and he said, waving his hand (I paraphrase) "Cooling? Cryogenics? Bah! In Calgary, it's enough to open the window!"
[14:00:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: lol cold does not really bother me
[14:00:49] <arschmitz> i used to teach alpine ski racing for a while
[14:00:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's what we've been having for the past two weeks. I've been loving it.
[14:00:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[14:01:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man, that brings me back ... Calgary is only, like, an hour and a half from Banff, which has some really awesome slopes ...
[14:01:48] <arschmitz> yeah and on cold days up in the mountains it can easily have a wind chile of  -30°C sometimes
[14:01:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For sure.
[14:02:09] <arschmitz> so -15°C isnt really that bad
[14:02:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was buying a bag of potatoes on credit, but I never did mind paying for the lift ticket :)
[14:02:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for sure that was half the reason i taught came with a free lift ticket to like 9 mountains around the country
[14:02:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I probably added a good many years to my paying-off-my-loan period with all that skiing :)
[14:03:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Dang!
[14:03:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's a perk and a half!
[14:03:20] <arschmitz> for sure
[14:03:29] <arschmitz> i skied 7 days a week lol
[14:03:47] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... good ole days ...
[14:03:52] <arschmitz> i raced in middle school and high school and it was the same then on the mountain 7 days a week
[14:04:07] <arschmitz> no im lucky to go once or twice a year :(
[14:04:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You're luckier than I ...
[14:04:37] <arschmitz> no good sking in finland?
[14:04:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and in Finland, you're lucky if you get a height difference of more than 600m ...
[14:04:51] <arschmitz> ahh ok
[14:05:16] <arschmitz> lol one of the mountins i grew up was like that though lol it was actually a valley not a mountin lol
[14:05:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: They have some slopes, and, I mean, nothing compared to Banff, but it'd still be worth it.
[14:05:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess maybe next winter we can try it - get my daughter on those cute baby skis :)
[14:06:14] <arschmitz> this place had a total vertical drop of 240feet lol
[14:06:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i was already talking about teaching my son when hes old enough lol
[14:07:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We have one here in the neighbourhood - it's probably about half that and the ticket costs like 15€ (~== $18)
[14:07:47] <arschmitz> yeah this place used to be $10/hr not sure any more
[14:08:01] <arschmitz> the good places around here are ~$70/day
[14:08:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... that's about the same as Sunshine (the place in Banff where we went)
[14:08:45] <arschmitz> cool
[14:08:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and that was, like, two big mountains and two smaller ones ...
[14:08:58] <arschmitz> yeah i think most good places in north america are around that
[14:09:29] <arschmitz> cool there is a good one here with 7 peaks called sunday river thats where i used to instruct
[14:09:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In a few years, if I manage to get my daughter hooked, maybe we can pay the Alps a visit.
[14:09:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ that would be awesome iv never been always wanted to though
[14:10:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: From what I've seen, they're pretty comparable to the Rockies ...
[14:10:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: never been there either :( only skied in New England
[14:11:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK! Then you definitely wanna go to Banff, or Whistler ...
[14:11:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or, in OR you can ski those big volcanoes ...
[14:11:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... like Mount Hood ...
[14:11:40] <arschmitz> yea i have some friends that moved to colorado after high school and they always talk about how awesome it is 
[14:11:52] <arschmitz> yeah that would be awesome volcano sking lol
[14:12:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... nothing beats mountains nearby.
[14:12:29] <arschmitz> its not bad here there are some really good size good mountains and they are all within 2 hours drive
[14:12:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This cold-averse colleague of mine got a job teaching at UBC in Vancouver, so Whistler's like his back yard.
[14:12:43] <arschmitz> ha ha 
[14:14:07] <_|Nix|_> I guess he must really put on the layers ...
[14:16:33] <_|Nix|_> Looking at that hasAttribute stuff, I think we can avoid it because only old versions of jQuery had trouble with attributes not being there. Newer ones return undefined when an attribute is absent.
[14:16:41] <_|Nix|_> Do we still support 1.6.4?
[14:20:21] <_|Nix|_> Dang! I introduced that hasAttribute thing ...
[14:20:41] <_|Nix|_> [custom select] Older versions of jQuery report 0 for .attr( "tabindex" ) if the attribute is absent. Check for its presence first.
[14:20:58] <arschmitz> no
[14:21:12] <arschmitz> we are 1.7 +
[14:21:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, great ... then we can revert that patch ...
[14:21:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll check to make sure first ...
[14:22:07] <arschmitz> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/01/14/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-3-0-beta/
[14:22:24] <arschmitz> its way down at bottom under support for jquery 1.9 and 2.0
[14:22:42] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[14:34:47] <_|Nix|_> Well, I'm heading out ... L8R all!
