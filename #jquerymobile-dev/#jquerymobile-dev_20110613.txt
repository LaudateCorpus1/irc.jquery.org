[07:31:44] <toddparker> Good morning
[07:40:42] <toddparker> hey guys - we've been running into schedule conflicts with our Tuesday meeting. Would Wednesday at the same time work for everyone?
[08:12:09] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:12:34] <gseguin> toddparker: Wednesday works for me
[08:37:59] <gseguin> todd_: Wednesday works for me
[08:42:53] <kinblas> todd_: I'm here
[09:29:05] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[09:29:28] <toddparker> kinblas and _nickel - would wednesdays work for the mobile call? 2pm est?
[09:32:10] <kinblas> toddparker: permanent move? Or just this week?
[09:34:15] <gseguin> _nickel is in diaper change training this week ;)
[09:34:18] <kinblas> Tuesday or Thursday is better for me, but if folks think Wednesday is better for them, I may miss a few meetings here and there
[09:34:36] <kinblas> gseguin: heh
[09:35:18] <kinblas> scottjehl: regarding pushstate, do we have a supports approach yet for it?
[09:35:28] <kinblas> just curious
[09:36:20] <kinblas> oh and FYI I'm still testing the phone gap and base tag cases
[09:36:23] <kinblas> today
[09:36:54] <scottjehl> $.support.pushState has been in since a1 - is that what you mean?
[09:40:21] <toddparker> permanent move
[09:40:31] <toddparker> thursday works for me
[09:40:46] <toddparker> gseguin and scottjehl and eddiemonge?
[09:40:59] <scottjehl> good for me
[09:41:00] <toddparker> forgot _nickel was out. he's a lucky fella
[09:41:27] <gseguin> oh Thursday, lemme check
[09:41:59] <gseguin> toddparker: yeah, that works
[09:42:15] <eddiemonge> thursdays are good except for this thursday for me
[09:53:46] <toddparker> so thursday then?
[09:54:12] <toddparker> Good conversation here about pre-fecting pages: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1819#issuecomment-1360138
[09:56:34] <toddparker> so kinblas - where are we with pushing that nav branch? seems like scott's question over the weekend was for something later
[09:56:46] <toddparker> do you want us to test WP7 now?
[09:57:38] <scottjehl> I like building on top of rel=prefetch
[09:57:52] <scottjehl> we'd need a support test to fetch only in browsers that don't support it
[09:58:31] <kinblas> toddparker: I just want to test the base tag stuff real-quick
[09:58:36] <kinblas> I can then land and test phonegap
[09:58:44] <kinblas> I'm in the midst of writing a unit test
[09:58:51] <toddparker> k,cool
[10:00:21] <gseguin> kinblas: are the 3 blockers going to be taken care of by your changes?
[10:01:05] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=6+-+Blocker&sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1&milestone=5
[10:02:38] * kinblas checks his blockers
[10:04:46] <kinblas> gseguin: 1640 and 1778 should be fixed
[10:04:52] <kinblas> gseguin: I need to check 1605
[10:32:39] <kinblas> gseguin: I'm not seeing any error for 1605 even with today's HEAD.
[10:33:12] <gseguin> that's great!
[10:53:11] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: gseguin: If you guys have time today, I really need help flagging which issues listed on this page still exist and which are fixed:
[10:53:14] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Refactor:-navigation-paths
[10:53:44] <kinblas> in general, and in theory, we shouldn't have any problems related to base tag and sub-directories
[10:54:12] <kinblas> we *STILL* have problems with specific characters in URLs when looking them up by selector
[10:54:33] <gseguin> kinblas: I will have time this afternoon
[10:55:41] <kinblas> gseguin: thanks!
[11:57:22] <scottjehl> hey Kinblas: wondering, did you ever write that changePage adapter?
[11:57:31] <scottjehl> we'll want it for beta I think
[12:03:41] <kinblas> scottjehl: oh yeah, it's that giant block of code at the top
[12:04:00] * kinblas notes that was "oh yeah" as in "oh yeah baby"
[12:04:00] <scottjehl> cool thx
[12:04:17] * scottjehl notes that that was awkward
[12:04:24] <kinblas> heh
[12:04:47] <kinblas> well I meant it as a statement, not like I'm remembering that I forgot it
[12:04:51] <kinblas> :-)
[12:05:23] <kinblas> anyways I sent folks an email if folks could kindly reply to the question of how should changePage() resolve relative paths that would be cool.
[12:11:35] <scottjehl> replied :)
[12:24:26] <toddparker> kinblas - what characters are causing issues in urls?
[12:24:44] <toddparker> i remember there were a few issues on that but they were listed at the bottom of the url wiki page
[13:29:38] <toddparker> for another day: thoughts on a new ThemeRoller for mobile
[13:29:40] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Mobile-ThemeRoller
[14:57:20] <gseguin> toddparker: Is there plans to add an RTE at some point in time?
[14:57:41] <gseguin> if that's even possible
[14:59:54] <toddparker> WTF is RTE
[14:59:56] <toddparker> :)
[15:01:07] <toddparker> rich text editor
[15:01:10] <toddparker> OMG
[15:01:19] <toddparker> Don't think so
[15:01:35] <toddparker> that would be pretty impossible, i think
[15:03:30] <scottjehl> how bout this:
[15:03:31] <scottjehl> data:text/html,<pre contenteditable>
[15:04:05] <scottjehl> :)
[15:04:05] <scottjehl> (via paul irish ;) )
[15:14:02] <kinblas> scottjehl: ping
[15:14:40] <scottjehl> yo
[15:14:50] <kinblas> so since _nickel is out
[15:15:21] <kinblas> I have navigation tests that I can't integrate into the index.html file of unit/navigation/
[15:15:29] <kinblas> because it requires a base tag
[15:15:39] <kinblas> should I just create a unit/navigationBase/
[15:15:48] <kinblas> or just stick the stuff in navigation under a new html file?
[15:16:11] <kinblas> I guess what I'm wondering is if we're trying to keep all tests named as index.html or what?
[15:17:55] <scottjehl> don't think we are.. whatever works!
[15:18:15] <scottjehl> I'm pretty sure we have another widget test that has more than one test page in it
[15:18:23] <kinblas> oh ok
[15:18:29] <kinblas> then I'll keep it in navigation
[15:18:51] <scottjehl> whatever gets this up and running sooner, and works best for you!
[15:28:40] <kinblas> FYI folks path fixes landed on the HEAD
[15:28:50] <kinblas> report all bugs to me and I'll fix 'em
[15:33:46] <gseguin> Woohoo!
[15:34:18] <gseguin> scottjehl: do you have pointer for this data:test/html thing?
[15:35:12] <scottjehl> YEAH! Nice one, Kin :)
[15:35:48] <scottjehl> gseguin: sorry, I was just kidding around. Paste data:text/html,<pre contenteditable> into your address bar in Chrome and you get a text editor ;)
[15:36:00] <gseguin> oh ok
[15:36:05] <gseguin> :)
[15:36:38] <gseguin> I do remember this trick now
[15:43:56] <scottjehl> :)
[16:00:09] <kinblas> gseguin: btw the deep linking to nested list item in an internal page is fixed on HEAD now
[16:00:31] <gseguin> kinblas: great!
[17:02:03] <_nickel> kinblas: build is green
[17:02:10] <_nickel> the build server had some connections issues :(
[17:02:31] <_nickel> do you guys want irc notifications here instead of email? We have the irc plugin installed
[17:04:00] <_nickel> gseguin: kinblas: toddparker: I'm going to add irc notifications - just shoot me an email if they get obnoxious
[20:54:40] <bubby323> Someone want to help me for a donation?
[21:04:59] <eddiemonge> with jquery mobile development?
[21:05:11] <eddiemonge> or with developing a site in jquery mobile?
