[09:05:55] <Wilto> Slide transitions will be fixed on Android—oh yes. They will be fixed on Android. You just mark my words, empty IRC channel.
[09:11:09] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:11:25] <gseguin> Wilto: That's fantastic news!

[09:32:11] <Wilto> 0% { right: 0%; } 1% { -webkit-transform: translateX(-0%); right: 5%; } 99% { -webkit-transform: translateX(-100%); right: 5%; } 100% { opacity: 0; right: 0%; }
[09:32:35] <Wilto> This is the CSS equivalent of aiming a six-shooter at Android’s feet and telling it to “dance.”
[09:32:48] <Wilto> But so help me, I think it’s working.
[09:38:27] <Wilto> gseguin: Any chance you have an Android within arm’s reach?
[09:38:49] <Wilto> I’m away from the FG gadget pile today, and can only test on 2.3 right now.
[09:38:55] <gseguin> Wilto: yes my arm can reach my pocket
[09:39:07] <Wilto> What version you got?
[09:39:10] <gseguin> 2.3.7
[09:39:27] <gseguin> but I'm in the office, I have plenty more
[09:39:34] <gseguin> give me an URL
[09:39:43] <Wilto> http://jquerymobile.com/test/ vs. http://wil.to/jqm/
[09:40:09] <Wilto> Checking for a combination of transition framerate and blinkiness. The second link should be about as smooth as the first, but without any blinking.
[09:40:19] <Wilto> Fingers crossed.
[09:43:22] <Wilto> Well, the second might be a LITTLE choppier, but not like “oh god what happened to transitions” choppy.
[09:44:38] <gseguin> brb
[10:02:55] <garann> Wilto: is this issue @agcolom added to the pull request for that button thing the same one you were referring to yesterday?
[10:03:02] <Wilto> Yup.
[10:03:18] <garann> cool
[10:05:53] <gseguin> Wilto: sorry, had to figure out some bug on the Jive side
[10:06:06] <gseguin> powering up 2.1 and 2.2 devices
[10:06:52] <Wilto> No worries, man. Thanks for checking this out.
[10:11:57] <gseguin> Wilto: it does look smoother to me on 2.1
[10:12:07] <Wilto> wil.to, or /test
[10:12:11] <Wilto> ?
[10:12:38] <gseguin> wil.to
[10:13:05] <gseguin> testing on 2.2 now
[10:15:13] <Wilto> Seeing any blinking on wil.to?
[10:15:24] <gseguin> Wilto: on 2.2 the flash happens before the transition on wil.to whereas it happens after the transition on /test
[10:15:34] <Wilto> Hm.
[10:15:40] <gseguin> s/flash/blinking/
[10:16:04] <gseguin> no blinking on 2.1
[10:16:23] <gseguin> alright EVERYBODY DOWNGRADES TO 2.1 NAO!
[10:18:07] <Wilto> It gets worse with every version, I swear.
[10:18:19] <Wilto> That sounds pretty promising, though. How’re the framerates lookin’ between the two?
[10:18:24] <Wilto> About the same?
[10:20:03] <gseguin> yeah
[10:20:26] <gseguin> let me grab the 3.x tablet
[10:21:01] <Wilto> That’s the real test, right there.
[10:22:13] <gseguin> it's a symphony of blinking in both
[10:22:17] <gseguin> it
[10:22:24] <gseguin> 's blinking before and after
[10:22:27] <Wilto> Sounds about right.
[10:22:39] <Wilto> One even slightly better than the other?
[10:22:39] <gseguin> I don't even see the transition
[10:23:04] <gseguin> I would say /test is better
[10:23:37] <Wilto> Crap.
[10:30:02] <Wilto> I dunno if that’s even gonna be fixable there, truth be told.
[10:30:25] <gseguin> Do you have an ICS device?
[10:34:53] <gseguin> Wilto: No luck with ICS either same behavior on both wil.to and /test
[10:35:06] <Wilto> No, but I hear it’s even more atrocious.
[10:35:36] <gseguin> yeah it's blinking and no transition visible
[10:37:40] <Wilto> Alright. The internet is sounding off that the blinking is a lot better in the less brutal versions of Android.
[10:38:16] <Wilto> So… That’s something, I guess. You able to keep that ICS gadget nearby? I’m gonna keep banging my head against this.
[10:38:53] <gseguin> yeah, it belongs to a coworker
[11:07:57] <Wilto> Like so many cop shows, inform them that we need to commandeer their mobile phone for “official jQuery business.”
[11:10:10] <gseguin> Wilto: no need I just flashed my phone with ICS ;)
[11:10:25] <Wilto> You’re a brave man!
[11:10:38] <Wilto> I gotta get an armload of old phones for the home office, methinks.
[11:11:19] <Wilto> Can you compare those again now? Make some changes to the wil.to one.
[11:11:46] <gseguin> gotta finish setting up the phone
[11:11:49] <Wilto> Oh, no worries.
[11:11:51] <gseguin> but after that yeah
[11:12:36] <Wilto> This change might re-introduce some blinkiness, but I’m lookin’ for a compromise.
[12:49:57] <Wilto> I’m beginning to think my time would be better spent walking around Boston slapping Androids out of peoples’ hands.
[13:41:29] <gseguin> Wilto: I just tried wil.to vs /test again on ICS
[13:41:46] <Wilto> Oh, just changed something, actually.
[13:41:51] <gseguin> look like you do something to drop down the address bar before starting the transition
[13:42:01] <Wilto> Have a look now. The transitions out are busted, but the transitions IN should be smoother.
[13:42:28] <Wilto> As well as blink-free.
[13:43:07] <gseguin> that does make things smoother
[13:43:11] <Wilto> Awww yeah.
[13:43:20] <gseguin> but
[13:43:23] <Wilto> hell
[13:43:35] <gseguin> is the blank screen on purpose?
[13:43:42] <Wilto> the what now
[13:43:49] <Wilto> Oh. The out transitions are just blank right now.
[13:43:57] <gseguin> oh ok
[13:44:18] <gseguin> great work!
[13:44:40] <Wilto> Just making it easier to track the differences in the transition, y’know? Otherwise stuff is flyin’ everywhere, and it’s hard to tell what’s broken.
[13:44:57] <Wilto> So, hopefully I can apply the same logic to the out transitions now.
[13:45:35] <gseguin> got it
[13:45:49] <Wilto> Scale of one to tell—one being “no transition” and ten being, y’know, iOS: how are we looking on ICS?
[13:46:00] <Wilto> one to ten. Man. Long day.
[13:46:37] <gseguin> comparing
[13:47:50] <gseguin> let me make a video of that
[13:47:58] <gseguin> or attempt to
[13:48:38] <Wilto> Oh, badass.
[13:48:57] <Wilto> If it’s a pain in the ass, no worries—getting late anyway, and I can check it out in the office tomorrow morning.
[14:02:16] <gseguin> Wilto: http://vimeo.com/34267503
[14:02:54] <Wilto> —HOLY HELL
[14:03:00] <Wilto> That is SO MUCH BETTER.
[14:03:10] <Wilto> That’s ICS!?
[14:03:17] <gseguin> yes
[14:03:27] <Wilto> I feel faint.
[14:03:32] <gseguin> :)
[14:06:34] <Wilto> I have no idea how I pulled this off.
[14:09:50] <gseguin> Wilto: it looks equally good on 2.2
[14:10:09] <Wilto> This doesn’t even make sense.
[14:10:17] <Wilto> This is _too much improvement_.
[14:10:30] <Wilto> I wonder how much disabling the out transition is impacting performance?
[14:10:59] <Wilto> If that’s the case, maybe we need to find a way to animate both pages simultaniously…
[14:11:17] <gseguin> it doesn't even drop the url bar on 2.2
[14:12:26] <Wilto> This is baffling.
[14:12:54] <gseguin> johnbender: you're around?
[14:27:45] <Wilto> Alright, I’m quitting while I’m ahead today.
[14:28:00] <Wilto> Really appreciate the help today, gseguin. Talk to you tomorrow, man.
[14:29:16] <gseguin> You're very welcome, have a good evening
[21:01:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl created transition-handler-cleanup (+2 new commits): http://git.io/VtbFJg
[21:01:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/transition-handler-cleanup] Much of the scripting in nav.js's transitionPages function was tied to the animation sequence for our css3transitionhandler. For example, the order was, scroll to top, run transitions, then scroll to the remembered location of the new page (there's more involved, but that's the gist of it). If we want to expand beyond this sequence, much of that scripting needs to move to the css3transiti
