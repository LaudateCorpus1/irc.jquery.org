[05:03:10] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:05:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: your createDom branch is pretty much  exactly what i had in mind essentially the same as what i wrote just extended  like we talked about
[05:07:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ill put together some performance tests for it on jsPerf

[05:10:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ^^ Ugh! todd just closed his first one
[05:10:58] <uGoMobi> his first one?
[05:10:59] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:11:16] <arschmitz> yeah hes not very helpful and cant read i think
[05:11:32] <uGoMobi> I know toddmparker_ can have OCD too when it comes to closing issues ;)
[05:11:40] <arschmitz> i want to not be nice on his second ticket
[05:12:25] <uGoMobi> ohh you were refering to first issue of that person
[05:12:39] <arschmitz> yes
[05:12:43] <arschmitz> sorry
[05:15:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you commenting on second ticket?
[05:15:38] <arschmitz> yes
[05:15:45] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:16:38] <arschmitz> the part that really irks me is "plz fix my proble. my code is bellow:-"
[05:16:41] <uGoMobi> maybe he accidently posted twice... dunno
[05:16:48] <arschmitz> no they are slightly different
[05:16:50] <uGoMobi> haha yeah i know
[05:16:56] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[05:16:59] <arschmitz> second time he forgot to make his code code lol
[05:17:38] <uGoMobi> at first it was displayed as code block
[05:17:44] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:17:50] <arschmitz> second time it wasent
[05:18:01] <uGoMobi> now the first ticket doesnt show code block anymore either
[05:18:09] <uGoMobi> is github or windows issue
[05:18:11] <arschmitz> weird?
[05:18:21] <uGoMobi> sometimes you have to refresh
[05:18:41] <arschmitz> strange but yeah i just closed and commented
[05:19:11] <uGoMobi> i copied markup in jsbin and its working fine
[05:19:29] <arschmitz> on android 4.1?
[05:19:41] <uGoMobi> didn't test there, only desktop
[05:19:57] <arschmitz> oh he said it worked fine on desktop didnt work on latest android
[05:20:19] <uGoMobi> oh hang on
[05:20:20] <arschmitz> but who knows what he is considdering latest android since its phone dependant
[05:21:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: works fine on Android 4.1
[05:22:24] <arschmitz> yeah im guessing hes on a 2.3 device thats on latest for that device
[05:22:40] <arschmitz> so probably like 2.3.7 or something
[05:23:21] <uGoMobi> i think so too
[06:33:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: question for you
[06:34:55] <arschmitz> im getting test failures on master localy but the jenkins builds are green
[06:35:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its on the 1px bottom border for lists i know you worked on that quite a while back
[06:41:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm the 1.2-stable build on Jenkins also fails that test some times
[06:41:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this is every time i run in chrome
[06:41:59] <arschmitz> it looks like a rounding issue
[06:42:30] <uGoMobi> aha, yeah Chrome has issues with that lately
[06:42:36] <arschmitz> its getting 1.11111111111111px expecting 1px
[06:42:42] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:42:57] <uGoMobi> you also see those values in the inspector
[06:43:05] <arschmitz> i wonder if we should throw a parseInt() in there ?
[06:43:13] <uGoMobi> and in fact... the borders are not visible on your screen
[06:43:27] <uGoMobi> it has to do with using em values
[06:43:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that might be a good idea
[06:43:56] <uGoMobi> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%201.2-stable/39/#showFailuresLink
[06:44:13] <uGoMobi> same tests right ? ^^
[06:44:39] <arschmitz> yes but that is getting 0 which is a real problem
[06:44:46] <arschmitz> im getting 1.111111111111 which isnt
[06:45:20] <arschmitz> 1.1111111px is always going to get rounded to 1 when its showed anyway 0 is going to be 0
[06:46:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: parseInt would fix master on chrome but wouldnt do anything for those failures on 1.2
[06:46:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! Funny - I put together a performance test using our unit test setup ... I'm going to test if creating popup element using the new function improves performance.
[06:46:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can jsperf handle things like page loads and stuff? I mean, AJAX nav?
[06:47:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You'd have to enhance a given page, like 100 times.
[06:47:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure i havent tried i know there is an option for ajax tests though
[06:48:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking, to avoid AJAX loading, we can store the page inside a jQuery object (perhaps even created with our function :) ), and then enhance that page over and over.
[06:48:10] <arschmitz> i mean async not ajax lol
[06:48:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then we navigate to it, measure the time it takes to load, and $.mobile.back, and destroy the page.
[06:48:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm essentially doing that now with our unit test framework.
[06:48:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool on jsperf i was just going to test the function it self vs jquery way 
[06:48:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, jsperf would probably be better.
[06:49:41] <arschmitz> so no enhancing or anything like that just create an element append to body after
[06:49:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, OK. That's an immediate test.
[06:50:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: My way is more convoluted, I guess ... like, rendering a page that contains 256 identical popups 100 times.
[06:50:55] <arschmitz> lol yeah
[06:51:37] <arschmitz> i was looking a it more conceptually as to how much faster is this function then just tossing a string in $()
[06:52:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we can cherry-pick changes to the unit test into 1.2-stable branch
[06:55:00] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15SixtoSaez opened pull request #5435: Issue 1383 - fixes to handle single & double quotes in data-url (06master...06issue_1383)  02http://git.io/FfkywQ
[07:11:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, in popup, if we use the function, we still have to turn the resulting DOM elements into jQuery objects (so, like, $( $.mobile.createDom() ) because I'd have to make major mods throughout popup otherwise. The savings is negligible.
[07:12:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah im doing $($.createDom(ele)).appendTo('body'); for test
[07:12:41] <arschmitz> i removed mobile name space for the sake of testing
[07:13:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool ...
[07:19:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! If I declare the elements at the top and then clone them, it increases by a ms.

[07:30:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the added looping for children i think adds too much overhead
[07:32:19] <toddmparker> morning
[07:32:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, if there are 0 children it doesn't loop much ...
[07:32:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The array of children is optional.
[07:32:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah but dosent make sense jQuery is much much faster
[07:33:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But then how do you create things like <div><a href=""></a></div>?
[07:33:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can simplify the code if we impose more meaning on each member of the array.
[07:33:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think that if children are involved this approach wont make sense
[07:33:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For example, currently both div: [ {attrs}, [children] ] and div: ]
[07:34:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For example, currently both div: [ {attrs}, [children] ] and div: [[children], {attrs}] is valid.
[07:34:18] <arschmitz> im going to test with no children and see how it does
[07:34:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We should avoid calling $.type maybe.
[07:34:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It would make the code less flexible, but faster.
[07:35:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: BTW: I've gained a 9 ms advantage by using the function at the top of popup to declare the elements once, and then cloning the elements inside popup's _create().
[07:35:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll re-run in case it was a fluke
[07:38:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its not the children its the code in js perf jquery can create an element  with children 50% faster then createdom can create a single div
[07:40:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm sorry - I don't quite understand the last thing you said.
[07:41:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hold on i think something might be up with jsperf
[07:41:17] <arschmitz> skewing the tests
[07:41:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec: If we assign a value to .innerHTML, then the browser itself does the parsing, right?
[07:41:47] <arschmitz> yes
[07:42:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, how can our code ever be faster than native?
[07:42:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait, it can, because the initial input format is faster.
[07:42:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We're not parsing HTML, but JSON.
[07:42:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Parsing HTML, even in the browser, may be slower than parsing JSON in js.
[07:43:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... anyway, I'm seeing a consistent improvement.
[07:47:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok fixed tests
[07:48:44] <arschmitz> createdom is exactly the same as the $("<div ...")
[07:48:55] <arschmitz> on chrome 
[07:53:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsperf.com/createdomvsjquery 
[07:53:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about some mobile devices?
[07:53:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have some ios on there
[07:53:53] <arschmitz> trying android now
[07:55:05] <_|Nix|_> In IE9 our method is faster :)
[07:55:13] <arschmitz> a bit yup
[07:55:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In my Chrome our method was 8% faster.
[07:56:21] <arschmitz> chrome went back and forth sometimes one somtimes the other when i retested a few times
[07:56:28] <_|Nix|_> Lemme grab my devices ...
[07:58:13] <toddmparker> that android issue is annoying. i edited the first one to see the code.
[07:58:44] <arschmitz> toddmparker: which android issue 
[07:58:56] <arschmitz> oh the guy you closed the first one and then i closed the second?
[07:59:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: WTF?! Both were the fastest?
[07:59:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, they're identical.
[07:59:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its a tie!
[08:01:07] <toddmparker> the transition one, yep
[08:01:19] <arschmitz> yeah he annoyed me 
[08:02:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker: the second i see plz fix my proble you lost me ha ha 
[08:03:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll simplify the code for createDom a bit ... let's see if that improves things ...
[08:04:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i wouldnt give up yet by any means 
[08:06:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... minor change. Lessee ...
[08:07:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Now the attributes have to come before the children.

[08:30:06] <_|Nix|_> Woah ... jQuery was 30% slower on Android 2.3.x ...
[08:30:28] <_|Nix|_> It can't even display the results because an error occurs in the bar chart :)
[08:34:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsperf.com/makedom-reverse/3
[08:35:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i kinda cheat a little but still
[08:36:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... I guess I sacrifice a lot of performance with that initial conditional, eh?
[08:37:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we should further restrict the function to always create only one DOM element.
[08:37:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right now, you can create an array if you wish.
[08:37:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah and did you see how i handle children?
[08:37:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I suppose we could publish mkChildren and then there's your array.
[08:37:58] <arschmitz> string toss it in innerHTML lol
[08:38:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but that defeats the purpose though.
[08:38:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The point is to use appendChild ...
[08:38:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, you're only saving on one level of the tree.
[08:38:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why the purpose is speed
[08:38:35] <arschmitz> this is faster
[08:39:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, as long as we only ever create DOM snippets that are one level deep.
[08:39:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lemme get rid of that conditional.
[08:39:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why you can toss any string you want in my way to make as complex an element as you need
[08:40:14] <arschmitz> the syntax might not be quite as pretty but its speed is much better
[08:42:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, but the children are all created using the native method.
[08:42:14] <arschmitz> whats wrong with that?
[08:42:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Only the outermost element is created using the createElement method.
[08:42:22] <arschmitz> right
[08:42:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If setting innerHtml is all it takes, then why doesn't jQuery do it that way and become much faster?
[08:43:09] <arschmitz> no idea
[08:43:16] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: ^
[08:43:59] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: We're examining ways of creating arbitrary bits of DOM rooted in a single element faster than jQuery.
[08:44:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: seems like jsperf is bias on test order here
[08:44:26] <DaveMethvin> just about to run, but I'll come back in about half an hour
[08:44:38] <DaveMethvin> innerhtml is basically faster unless you're cloning large trees of code
[08:44:39] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: We're exploring an alternative JSON notation, and a function to convert the JSON into DOM.
[08:44:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i changed the test order and th results change a lot
[08:44:46] <DaveMethvin> back later
[08:44:51] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: K L8R
[08:45:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: DaveMethvin is the one that suggested the stuff i posted last night 
[08:45:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That seems to support your way of doing it, since the DOM we're talking about is at most 3 levels deep.
[08:45:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[08:46:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and never more than a few elements.
[08:46:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There is a wrinkle though:
[08:46:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for accuracy i think i need to split these tests out since order is messing with them
[08:46:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you create these elements and then you wish to store the inner ones in separate variables, you now have to use jQuery to fish them out of the outermost one.
[08:46:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[08:47:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you construct them all using recursively, you can tag those you wish returned and they will be assigned as they are constructed.
[08:47:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No need to invoke the large selection machinery.
[08:47:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, you could probably access the DOM elements and just go .children[ 1 ] or whatever ...
[08:48:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... since you know the structure.
[08:48:03] <arschmitz> true
[08:48:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess it's not worth competing with .innerHtml for small DOM chunks.
[08:48:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: dosent look like it
[08:51:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Let's keep your version, but let's use an array instead of an object: [ "tagName", { attrs }, "innerHtml" ]

[09:26:24] <johnbender> :P
[09:26:36] <johnbender> cool
[09:26:36] <johnbender> well
[09:26:39] <johnbender> I'll get to work
[09:27:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: firefox really is an annomoly
[09:27:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: WP7.5 is still running the makeDom portion of the tests, and the screen is showing some funk stuff ...
[09:28:18] <arschmitz> android 2.3.7 was really slow too
[09:28:33] <arschmitz> but makedom still won by like 40%
[09:28:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not bad, overall.
[09:28:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... aside from FF ...
[09:29:13] <arschmitz> yeah and firefox 17 for me makedom either wins by very very little or they tie and both say fastes
[09:29:25] <arschmitz> i havent had jquery win on firfox even once
[09:30:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For me, makeDom is, like, 50% slower ... I don't get it.
[09:30:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ your on linux must be that
[09:30:35] <arschmitz> im on windows
[09:30:41] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15doochik opened issue #5438: <script> tag in body executes twice  02http://git.io/9Lkxjw
[09:31:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Must be.
[09:31:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: iv re run like 10 times and its the same every time and i refresh everyt time too
[09:32:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: did you notice how much faster both methods are on firefox in the chart though
[09:32:56] <arschmitz> they are like a factor of 10 faster then everything else
[09:33:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ...
[09:33:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yet it feels slower on FF than Chrome ... not sure how much that result is worth.
[09:34:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i agree
[09:34:12] <arschmitz> i think firefox is cheating lol
[09:34:46] <_|Nix|_> :)
[09:35:01] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you here?
[09:35:11] <toddmparker> just wondering how goes on panels
[09:35:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: D000d WP7.5 is insanely slow!
[09:35:25] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yep. it's terrible w/js
[09:36:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: we have been testing ways of createing dom elements on the fly like we talked about yesterday and think we have a winner
[09:36:41] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: and the function is only 8 lines long!
[09:37:06] <toddmparker> sweet - awesome guys
[09:37:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker_:http://jsperf.com/makedomarrayvjquery
[09:37:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am here
[09:37:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll try your code with my convoluted popup setup.
[09:37:30] <toddmparker> oh hai uGoMobi 
[09:37:36] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker 
[09:37:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sweet
[09:37:56] <toddmparker> do you need any code/testing help today?
[09:38:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no, not really I think
[09:38:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: WTF happened ?! All of a sudden I'm on a different page O_o
[09:38:56] <uGoMobi> I am not making changes to panel code anymore
[09:39:03] <uGoMobi> I am updating the docs now
[09:39:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: WP7.5 is fux0rred ...
[09:39:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: crazy
[09:39:34] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I don't know on what devices Wilto tested already
[09:40:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I ran the tests again and I turned off the screen. I won't touch it again until I refresh on my desktop and I have WP7.5 results ...
[09:40:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ha ha
[09:41:12] <agcolom> Hi johnbender, sorry I was traveling... 
[09:41:47] <johnbender> agcolom: no worries
[09:41:49] <agcolom> yes, as soon as you push it will get deployed
[09:41:57] <johnbender> agcolom: I'm just getting started today
[09:42:00] <johnbender> so I'm new to all this
[09:42:04] <johnbender> agcolom: I've got the build running
[09:42:14] <johnbender> the xml looks fairly straight forward
[09:42:25] <agcolom> yes, it is 
[09:43:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I think Wilto only tested iOS and Android. Maybe you can have the panel branch tested on WP and BB?
[09:44:02] <toddmparker> i'll test bb and wp
[09:44:22] <uGoMobi> great!
[09:44:37] <uGoMobi> blog post looks really good BTW!
[09:44:56] <uGoMobi> will check this weekend if anything is missing
[09:45:39] <toddmparker> thanks
[09:45:44] <arschmitz> toddmparker: the swipe rewrite is missing
[09:45:46] <toddmparker> agcolom gave me some good notes
[09:45:53] <toddmparker> ah, right arschmitz 
[09:46:03] <toddmparker> was that in the 1.3 wiki page?
[09:46:08] <arschmitz> yup
[09:46:11] <toddmparker> if so, i'll just add it in
[09:46:13] <toddmparker> ok
[09:46:32] <arschmitz> im working on updateing the docs for the and range the rest of the day
[09:46:38] <uGoMobi> agcolom: if I have demo for new API docs for changePage and loadPage methods we are good, right? or was there a 3rd that needs a demo?
[09:47:01] <toddmparker> arschmitz: great!
[09:47:41] <uGoMobi> BTW - in the new API docs pages jumps when it's loaded
[09:48:03] <uGoMobi> I think it's because of our code... we set focus
[09:48:57] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, I'll check...
[09:49:01] <uGoMobi> so the focus is set to iframe example
[09:49:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: fun fact for the blog maybe is that we have closed ~510 issues since 1.2
[09:50:07] <agcolom> toddmparker: yes, I started writing the notes, then I thought it'd be easier for everyone to annotate your docs ;-) (Big thanks to Adobe Acrobat Pro!)
[09:50:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: dANG!
[09:51:35] <arschmitz> toddmparker: and fixedtoolbar issues are now up to 41 closed 
[09:51:48] <arschmitz> and only 3 open
[09:52:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know right lots of issues closed in last 3 months
[09:52:35] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes I think that's it for now.
[09:52:45] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: panels looks slick on the playbook
[09:53:12] <agcolom> we have some code for the demos but we just need to add something to get the function executed.
[09:53:13] <uGoMobi> ah great
[09:53:38] <toddmparker> yeah, everything is great on playbook
[09:54:22] <toddmparker> WP7.5 is a go too
[09:54:31] <toddmparker> we tested iOS and android a lot already
[09:54:35] <toddmparker> so i think we're good
[09:54:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I'll take care of those two as promised. Sorry it took so long but got a bit sidetracked after it didn't get it to work in the iframe
[09:55:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I saw an issue on Opera Mobile
[09:55:41] <agcolom> uGoMobi: no worries at all :-) 
[09:55:48] <uGoMobi> like there was some padding added to the page or something
[09:56:06] <toddmparker> hmm
[09:56:07] <uGoMobi> will give that a look
[09:56:35] <uGoMobi> not even sure if I tested that with latest
[09:57:01] <agcolom> uGoMobi: if that's easier, as I now have a local setup, so if you can just do a simple example, then I can try to incorporate it and see if it works...
[09:57:06] <toddmparker> some rendering artifacts on iPad 1 running 5

[09:58:48] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok I will keep that in mind. Will be working on demos this weekend and let you know if I still don't get the demo to work local
[09:59:04] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: opera mini on ios6 looks fine
[09:59:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I'll test Opera Mobile again now
[09:59:44] <toddmparker> this was mini
[10:00:10] <toddmparker> the left panels are fine, right are blank on mini
[10:00:55] <toddmparker> hmm
[10:01:10] <toddmparker> i just tested ios4 on iPad and the page blanks out completely
[10:01:26] <toddmparker> iOS is less important now but yikes
[10:01:26] <uGoMobi> hmm :(
[10:01:42] <toddmparker> i found that was happening when we added hw accel to the page in certain ways
[10:02:23] <toddmparker> test is ok on ios4
[10:03:07] <uGoMobi> so it's the hardware accel.
[10:03:42] <toddmparker> yeah

[10:03:51] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 143211700 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: added example for isRelativeUrl
[10:04:26] <toddmparker> compare what we have in master 
[10:04:37] <toddmparker> ios4 is very fragile this way
[10:04:48] <toddmparker> you can see it on browserstack
[10:04:56] <johnbender> agcolom: what does your workflow look like, do you ever preview what the output will look like in wordpress (somehow) before pushing?
[10:06:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: going to test small modification on BS
[10:06:48] <uGoMobi> and Opera Mobile... it was a scrollbar that I saw (not easy to recognize as such)
[10:09:48] <toddmparker> ah
[10:10:01] <toddmparker> not sure why mini isn't showing the right panels
[10:10:15] <toddmparker> mini is garbage
[10:10:22] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:10:32] <uGoMobi> it is... proxy garbage
[10:13:04] <arschmitz> huge usage in other parts of the world for some reason though
[10:13:29] <uGoMobi> yeah it has a fair marketshare
[10:14:03] <uGoMobi> opera mini on android is same.. right panels broken, left reveal too
[10:14:44] <uGoMobi> hard to debug when you can't test local :/
[10:14:50] <toddmparker> right, left reveal on ios
[10:15:39] <toddmparker> master is broken the same way
[10:16:24] <toddmparker> hash is all wacky too
[10:17:02] <toddmparker> actually all panels are broken on master in mini :/
[10:17:19] <toddmparker> if opera mini = use left overlay
[10:17:32] <toddmparker> problem solved
[10:20:05] <toddmparker> i'm not kidding
[10:20:10] <uGoMobi> maybe we should make proxy browsers like opera mini and symbian series 40 C-grade
[10:20:47] <uGoMobi> almost none of the styling works on opera mini anyway
[10:21:41] <uGoMobi> cant set font size, no border radius, no background image gradient
[10:23:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: how's panel on amazon kindle fire
[10:24:55] <toddmparker> if we can make the styling look better on c-grade in 1.4
[10:24:59] <toddmparker> let me check
[10:27:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes I agree we should at some more basic styles for C grade in 1.4
[10:28:28] <toddmparker> i think we do do away with a lot of js-added classes
[10:28:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: good news, I could fix iOS4 (at least on BS) and still looks good on Android
[10:28:39] <toddmparker> we can protect styles via media query now
[10:28:49] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great!
[10:29:51] <toddmparker> iPad mini looks slick
[10:30:04] <toddmparker> that was surprisingly bad when we were testing
[10:31:08] <Wilto> +1 to opting Opera Mini into whichever style of panel looks best.
[10:31:11] <toddmparker> btw - the swipe to close isn't working still
[10:31:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that fix is on master
[10:32:02] <toddmparker> right, just confirmed that
[10:32:16] <toddmparker> your re-factor looks way better on iPad mini

[10:33:55] <johnbender> agcolom: I added a watch task to the grunt
[10:33:58] <uGoMobi> only thing I still see now is with Chrome / Android reveal mode.. the page content wrap doesn't look slick while transitioning
[10:34:04] <johnbender> agcolom: you can do `grunt watch` and then just edit your files
[10:34:20] <johnbender> any time you make a change to something in entries/ it'll automatically trigger a build
[10:34:27] <johnbender> so you can just edit and then refresh your browser window
[10:34:32] <johnbender> (I'm assuming a workflow here)
[10:34:53] <johnbender> (that is, that there isn't a better workflow)
[10:35:03] <uGoMobi> (hi johnbender )
[10:35:10] <johnbender> (than just building with `grunt` and refreshing)
[10:35:16] <johnbender> :)
[10:35:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: lisp conversations
[10:35:29] <uGoMobi> :D
[10:37:35] <agcolom> johnbender: oh ok. So do I need to do a pull and npm install to get this ?
[10:38:01] <johnbender> agcolom: yes
[10:38:05] <agcolom> (yes currently I make a change then deploy then refresh my browser :-)
[10:38:20] <johnbender> agcolom: you do a deploy to wordpress?
[10:38:23] <agcolom> ok, trying now...
[10:38:24] <johnbender> wowzers
[10:38:29] <johnbender> agcolom: it won't deploy to wordpress
[10:38:34] <johnbender> it'll just do the basic build
[10:38:51] <agcolom> ok. yes I deploy to my local setup with wordpress
[10:38:57] <johnbender> I've just been editing and viewing the output that's on my local file system
[10:39:05] <johnbender> agcolom: ah
[10:39:21] <johnbender> agcolom: that makes sense
[10:39:23] <johnbender> agcolom: ok!
[10:39:24] <johnbender> then
[10:39:27] <agcolom> Adam helped me get this done yesterday
[10:39:39] <johnbender> agcolom: then there's only one small change you need to make
[10:39:44] <johnbender> to get it to work for you
[10:39:59] <johnbender> agcolom: open grunt.js
[10:40:05] <agcolom> ok...
[10:40:08] <johnbender> agcolom: down toward the bottom under "watch"
[10:40:45] <johnbender> change the word "build" to whatever grunt command you normally run
[10:40:52] <johnbender> agcolom: I assume it's build-wordpress ?
[10:41:21] <johnbender> agcolom: tasks: ['build'], 
[10:41:24] <johnbender> becomes
[10:41:36] <johnbender> agcolom: tasks: ['build-wordpress'],
[10:41:41] <johnbender> if build-wordpress is the right one
[10:41:57] <johnbender> and then just type `grunt watch` on the command line
[10:42:03] <johnbender> and it will sit there waiting until you make a change
[10:42:11] <agcolom> I have build-wordpress in various places...
[10:42:15] <johnbender> when you change an xml file it will run `grunt build-wordpress`
[10:42:33] <johnbender> agcolom: what do you run to do the deploy?
[10:42:43] <agcolom> locally?
[10:42:46] <johnbender> yes
[10:42:53] <agcolom> now I do grunt deploy
[10:43:12] <agcolom> and it deploys to my local setup
[10:43:18] <toddmparker> brb
[10:43:28] <agcolom> (to local.api.jquerymobile.com)
[10:45:01] <agcolom> johnbender: I've uploaded my grunt.js http://users.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jqm/grunt.js so you can see it

[10:45:52] <johnbender> just pushed it 
[10:45:59] <johnbender> the push was prevented earlier
[10:46:34] <agcolom> done
[10:47:19] <agcolom> yes I've got the new version now.
[10:49:20] <agcolom> OMG!!!!! This is fantastic!!!! Thank you johnbender :-)
[10:49:43] <johnbender> agcolom: just make sure to change that command to whatever you normally use
[10:49:57] <johnbender> agcolom: also have you ever used gist.github.com?
[10:50:08] <uGoMobi> Wilto: arschmitz agcolom : any of you has an iPad running iOS5 ?
[10:50:26] <johnbender> agcolom: or was that file just available because you keep a copy of jqm up on your uni account
[10:50:29] <johnbender> ?
[10:50:34] <johnbender> agcolom: you know what never mind
[10:50:39] <johnbender> go forth and conquer
[10:51:48] <agcolom> well I've done the grunt watch and is it that it's doing the checking/build each time I save?
[10:52:21] <agcolom> then I keep the grunt deploy to deploy to my local setup to check things look ok
[10:52:43] <agcolom> I have never used gist :-(
[10:52:53] <johnbender> agcolom: grunt watch watches the file system
[10:52:58] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes I have
[10:53:06] <johnbender> when you save it runs the command
[10:53:08] <johnbender> simple
[10:53:14] <johnbender> but only for files in entries/
[10:53:15] <agcolom> that's great! 
[10:53:22] <johnbender> we can change that obviously if you want to
[10:54:04] <uGoMobi> agcolom: great! can you test left reveal on this page http://jquerymobile.com/branches/panel-refactor-part2/docs/panels/index.html
[10:54:06] <agcolom> that's all I need really. It prevents me from pushing things with errors and having to change them a million times ;-)
[10:54:52] <agcolom> (often I push before doing a deploy because I forget, then run grunt and discover I had errors ;-) 
[10:55:03] <agcolom> Thank you v much johnbender 
[10:55:32] <johnbender> agcolom: np np
[10:57:16] <toddmparker> ok back
[10:59:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: on BS iOS5 iPhone and iPad - left reveal panel background comes back after you closed the panel
[11:00:21] <agcolom> uGoMobi: it works fine, but I think there's a funny lack of synchronicity between the panel opening and its background
[11:00:46] <agcolom> (also ocurrs with reveal right panel)
[11:00:54] <toddmparker> yeah, i see that
[11:01:25] <toddmparker> push has a slight flicker
[11:01:30] <toddmparker> reveal has that odd artifact
[11:01:55] <uGoMobi> looks like z-index issue
[11:02:54] <toddmparker> yeah?
[11:03:54] <uGoMobi> or better description.... when you open the reveal panel it's contents is on top of the transitioning page content wrap right away
[11:04:06] <uGoMobi> s/it's/its
[11:06:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: agcolom : I fixed it, but left panel still acts weird
[11:07:11] <uGoMobi> we would have to test again on real device
[11:07:45] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, same URL?
[11:08:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, but I have to push changes first and then we have to wait for hourly update of branch preview
[11:08:48] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, after dinner then ;-)
[11:08:56] <uGoMobi> ok great
[11:09:02] <uGoMobi> enjoy your dinner

[11:47:48] <johnbender> ?
[11:47:51] <johnbender> question mark
[11:47:51] <ajpiano> johnbender: YES
[11:47:57] <johnbender> ajpiano: lol
[11:47:59] <ajpiano> i want us to do a vagrant box sooooooooooo bad
[11:48:08] <ajpiano> i think the guys did some work on it a few months ago
[11:48:11] <ajpiano> before the dev summit
[11:48:31] <ajpiano> johnbender: i wrote http://stage.contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/ last night
[11:48:35] <johnbender> ajpiano: I did the basics for the servers but I don't know about that instance
[11:48:40] <ajpiano> and really was thinking about having some nice vagranty instructions
[11:49:25] <johnbender> ajpiano: ok I'll ping the infra guys to see if we can't just fire up one of the instances locally and use that
[11:49:28] <johnbender> ajpiano: I'll let you know
[11:49:31] <ajpiano> yeah
[11:49:37] <ajpiano> much appreciated
[11:52:08] <agcolom> johnbender: yes

[11:54:16] <johnbender> the event is next
[11:54:30] <johnbender> those docs are sparse but I'm struggling to come up with something else to say
[11:54:41] <johnbender> I could provide a feature list of sorts in the description or something
[11:55:14] <johnbender> agh
[11:55:17] <johnbender> my example is confusing
[11:55:21] <agcolom> Looks like my connection is CRAZY slow!

[11:56:13] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 142d86365 15John Bender: clarify navigate method example
[12:00:52] <agcolom> johnbender: if it is possible, it would be great if you could do the examples as in http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.path.isRelativeUrl/ so that it will create an automatic iframe demonstrating the example in action... (only if applicable)
[12:01:28] <agcolom> johnbender: ignore what I just said!
[12:01:51] <johnbender> agcolom: do you mean for navigate?
[12:02:07] <agcolom> sorry I got confused....
[12:02:33] <agcolom> johnbender: yes, is this something we can actually demonstrate easily?
[12:02:46] <johnbender> agcolom: haven't tested it in iframes
[12:03:04] <johnbender> and no not really anyway since viewing the url is a lot of the value
[12:03:17] <agcolom> yes, that;s what I was wondering...
[12:03:32] <agcolom> (probably not possible)
[12:04:04] <johnbender> agcolom: especially because most of what happens is on teh code level
[12:04:09] <johnbender> there's nothing visually interesting
[12:04:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you still here?
[12:04:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[12:04:43] <agcolom> johnbender: that's great! Thanks a lot! 
[12:05:08] <johnbender> agcolom: np, hopefully at some point in the near future I'll write a blerg post about this bit of the library
[12:05:12] <agcolom> I'll have a good read and check that I understand everything... If I can understand it, then everybody will :-)
[12:05:13] <arschmitz> if you dont want to wait the hour for update you can use the branches page i showed in meeting yesterday
[12:05:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ^^
[12:05:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah right
[12:05:57] <arschmitz> i think its there already you would just need to hit update
[12:06:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you post link to panel-refactor-part2 for agcolom ?
[12:06:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also i have ios5 phone here but my ios5 ipad is at home
[12:07:10] <arschmitz> docs or demos?
[12:07:16] <agcolom> johnbender: the description is very clear. Thank you v much.
[12:07:31] <johnbender> agcolom: thanks, feel free to alter it at will
[12:07:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: docs > panel
[12:07:47] <uGoMobi> reveal mode
[12:07:52] <arschmitz> http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/panel-refactor-part2/docs/panels/index.html
[12:08:20] <uGoMobi> perfect
[12:08:25] <uGoMobi> thanks arschmitz !
[12:08:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem any time you need an uptodate branch preview thats what its there for
[12:09:13] <uGoMobi> bookmarked
[12:10:04] <arschmitz> if its not listed you just click new branch and put the branch name in
[12:10:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: arschmitz do you see any issues with reveal mode if you test on iOS5 ?
[12:10:24] <arschmitz> checking now 
[12:11:36] <arschmitz> yikes its much much worse now!
[12:11:53] <arschmitz> when i close reveal the background stays for a while
[12:12:05] <arschmitz> and when i open it dosent have a background
[12:12:16] <uGoMobi> pfff
[12:12:24] <arschmitz> and after like 30 second the panel background goes aways finally
[12:12:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this made all modes much worse
[12:13:13] <uGoMobi> hmm
[12:13:39] <uGoMobi> i made a change to fix iOS4 and another small change to fix iOS5
[12:13:54] <arschmitz> something got real bad on 5
[12:14:01] <uGoMobi> i think the change for iOS4 has negative impact on iOS5
[12:14:12] <arschmitz> thats not a good trade off lol
[12:14:55] <uGoMobi> yeah doesn't sound good
[12:16:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: your a css expert i have a question i can explain
[12:17:19] <arschmitz> button text on inline buttons is getting the elipsis treatment on all buttons when i look at them on my server straight clone of branch of github
[12:17:31] <arschmitz> but when i look local or on jquerymobile.com they are fine
[12:21:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: on chrome?
[12:21:19] <arschmitz> yes
[12:21:27] <arschmitz> its really weird 
[12:22:07] <uGoMobi> hmm
[12:23:02] <arschmitz> and its a brand new clean clone of master
[12:24:17] <uGoMobi> same CSS same markup same browser
[12:24:29] <arschmitz> yeah everything is the same
[12:24:44] <uGoMobi> sorry but I have no explanation for the difference
[12:24:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats ok i dont either!
[12:25:03] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:25:19] <agcolom> uGoMobi: will test in a bit...
[12:25:20] <uGoMobi> chrome does have some weird rendering issues lately
[12:25:53] <arschmitz> not sure only difference is where its sitting what server its on
[12:26:59] <arschmitz> oh uGoMobi: something i noticed in docs for panels
[12:27:37] <arschmitz> the controlgroup for basics/options/methods/events
[12:27:38] <exit2> you guys like jquery mobile?
[12:27:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: border bottom gone?
[12:27:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it is a UL 
[12:28:06] <arschmitz> which yes makes it have no bottom border
[12:28:24] <uGoMobi> the border is there
[12:28:33] <uGoMobi> but it's chrome rendering issue
[12:28:56] <uGoMobi> same as what we talked about earlier today
[12:29:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: why are we using a ul not a div?
[12:29:02] <uGoMobi> what makes tests fail
[12:29:19] <arschmitz> changing to a div makes it work correctly
[12:29:27] <uGoMobi> maybe good for SEO
[12:30:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it works fine on other pages
[12:30:26] <uGoMobi> when you apple hardware accel to it the issue is gone too i noticed
[12:30:44] <arschmitz> oh speaking of apple....
[12:31:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: look at metrics in chrome inspector... you see values like 32.2320562707650726508650px

[13:06:23] <arschmitz> have a good one uGoMobi
[13:07:12] <gseguin> arschmitz: I think the infra guys can hook you up if it doesn't show "jQuery" when you log in
[13:07:35] <arschmitz> gseguin: thats what i always log in with because iv been paying for it since before i joint the team
[13:07:47] <arschmitz> joined not joint ha ha
[13:08:11] <arschmitz> gseguin: cool ill check with them

[13:11:02] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: was just told i should talk to one of you about a browserstack login
[13:11:13] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: then you asked the wrong one :(
[13:11:17] <ryanneufeld> I don't even have one
[13:11:30] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer and Krinkle do I think
[13:11:44] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld:  cool thanks
[13:18:24] <agcolom> uGoMobi: have a very good weekend.
[13:19:58] <agcolom> btw i have tested panels on iOS 4 (ipad 2) and iOS5 ipad 3. They work ok, but I still see that layer issue. however, closing the panel works fine, although on iOS 4 there is a final flicker once the left panel has disappeared. 
[13:20:47] <agcolom> i'll wait until you setup those test pages to test further... I will be able to test
[13:21:02] <agcolom> iOS 5 iPad 3 and iPod Touch
[13:21:14] <agcolom> iOS 4 iPad 2
[13:21:19] <agcolom> iOS 5 iPAd 1
[13:21:37] <agcolom> iOS 5 iphone 4S
[13:21:52] <arschmitz> wow thats some serious ios 
[13:21:56] <agcolom> iOS 3 (a very old iPod touch)...
[13:22:15] <arschmitz> i thought i was doing good with 2 iphones and 2 ipads lol 
[13:22:35] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes, I was leading a project for using mobile devices in education...
[13:22:59] <agcolom> and you can't get paid or buy out time off teaching, so you have to spend the money on gadgets....
[13:23:13] <agcolom> so technically they belong to the university ;-)
[13:23:14] <arschmitz> cool 
[13:23:53] <agcolom> and I also had to do the same when I won a prize for excellence in teaching and learning...
[13:23:53] <arschmitz> my wife and i each have ipads and iphones and iv managed to keep on of each of 5/6 so i get pretty good test coverage for the newer stuff anyway
[13:24:09] <agcolom> that's cool ;-) 
[13:24:25] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:24:27] <agcolom> my partner bought arduino stuff with what was left ;-)
[13:24:35] <arschmitz> nice\
[13:24:39] <arschmitz> robot goodness
[13:24:39] <agcolom> (arduino and Xbee modules)
[13:24:51] <agcolom> yes ;-)
[13:25:33] <arschmitz> using johnny 5 from rwaldron?
[13:25:44] <agcolom> no, not yet ;-)
[13:26:42] <agcolom> time for me to go as well... 
[13:26:49] <agcolom> have a good weekend all...
[13:27:01] <arschmitz> good night im leaving in a few to get my new mac :)
[13:27:18] <agcolom> arschmitz: enjoy ;-)
[13:27:34] <agcolom> once you have a mac, you can never go back to PC!
[13:27:55] <arschmitz> so i hear
[13:32:25] <arschmitz> wow this is insane this is on the student portal for a major ONLINE university "The site may not function properly if you are using a non-supported browser. Recommended browsers with minimum supported browser versions include Internet Explorer 7.0 and Firefox 1.0 for Windows. Also, Firefox 1.0 and Safari 3.0 for Macintosh users."
[13:36:48] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: ask scott_gonzalez about BrowserStack access
[13:36:56] <jzaefferer> he's got the keys
[13:37:07] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: awesome thank you
[13:37:30] <scott_gonzalez> Who needs access?
[13:37:35] <scott_gonzalez> Just give me an email address.
[13:37:43] <arschmitz> arschmitz@gmail.com
[13:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> You should have an invite in your inbox now.
[13:38:17] <arschmitz> i do thank yo
[13:38:18] <arschmitz> u
[13:38:24] <scott_gonzalez> You're welcome.
[13:39:00] <arschmitz> now need to cancel my current one so i can sign up with your invite lol
[13:39:05] <jzaefferer> If that's not a key, I don't know what is ;)
[13:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> I have outstanding invites for Gabriel Schulhof, Kin Blas, and John Bender.
[13:39:45] <scott_gonzalez> I think John had an account from somewhere else.
[13:39:51] <scott_gonzalez> And Kin is no longer active?
[13:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure these invites were sent several months ago.
[13:41:13] <arschmitz> i dont think kin is 
[13:49:34] <Faralla> Hi. Sorry about asking this in the dev channel, but #jquerymobile seems to be closed. I am build in PhoneGap application with jquerymobile. I have a map view on one page (leaflet) with header and footer. Is there a way to determine the height of the content area (the space between header and footer)?
[13:50:59] <Faralla> setting height: 100% does not work because im am also including an adMob-Ad which messes with the webView component size
[13:51:01] <arschmitz> Faralla: #jquerymobile is closed please ask all questions on #jquery
[14:45:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You know, for widgets, this function may not be necessary at all. If we stick to declaring all our DOM elements using native at the top of each widget module's IIFE, then we can use clone() inside the widget.
[14:47:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I just found the native cloneNode( true ), so we don't even need to use jQuery's clone() ...
[14:48:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... though I'm not sure how widely supported that is.
[14:48:31] <toddmparker> who let all the UI riff raff up in here?
[14:48:42] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:49:03] <toddmparker> oh, browserstack. thanks jzaefferer and scott_gonzalez 
[14:52:43] <toddmparker> sounds like that iOS4 fix hurt iOS5+ huh?
[14:53:10] <toddmparker> we might need to do a little UA there. the refactored panels left you with a *blank* page. we need to do something
[14:53:26] <toddmparker> but maybe we can shield the hw accel rules form iOS4

[17:11:35] <toddmparker_> johnbender: thanks for cranking out those docs. we need to show off your hard work. would there be any simple demo pages we should put together to illustrate how to do things? not for monday, just in general
[17:11:53] <johnbender> toddmparker_: agcolom asked the same thing
[17:12:01] <toddmparker_> heh. great minds...
[17:12:09] <johnbender> it would only illustrate things if they inspected
[17:12:18] <johnbender> the value is the events and the method
[17:12:19] <johnbender> the code
[17:12:26] <toddmparker_> been trying to think up real-world demos to show how to use things or take 'em further
[17:12:40] <toddmparker_> yeah
[17:12:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: well in the context of jquery mobile it would look silly
[17:12:55] <johnbender> "Look you can dynamically load content!"
[17:12:57] <johnbender> lol
[17:12:58] <johnbender> well yah
[17:13:04] <johnbender> jquery mobile does dynamic content
[17:13:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I can take the docs a bit further maybe
[17:13:23] <johnbender> do some in depth examples
[17:13:30] <johnbender> or
[17:13:32] <johnbender> a blog post
[17:13:41] <toddmparker_> maybe we can brainstorm the top 2-3 things we think people would typically do with the navigate event and made some simple demos
[17:13:56] <toddmparker_> these can take any form we need - more tutorial style is fine too
[17:14:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it would primarily be link hijacking
[17:14:30] <johnbender> and content management
[17:14:39] <toddmparker_> right
[17:14:39] <toddmparker_> just something to mull over
[17:14:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright
[17:14:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I thought about it today
[17:14:52] <toddmparker_> get the gears turning
[17:15:03] <johnbender> everything I came up with seems silly but I'll let it roll around in my head a bit
[17:16:53] <toddmparker_> ok
[17:17:03] <toddmparker_> so happy to get 1.3 out soon
[17:17:11] <toddmparker_> it's chock full of goodies
[18:07:18] <Ben_Sperry> okay that's better
