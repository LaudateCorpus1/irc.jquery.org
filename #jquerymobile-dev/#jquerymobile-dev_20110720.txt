[08:31:57] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:11:25] <toddparker> morning gseguin!
[09:11:36] <toddparker> hey, any update on the transition stuff?
[09:11:54] <toddparker> what do we need to do for that to get into shape?
[09:11:55] <gseguin> I handed it off to scottjehl last friday
[09:12:06] <toddparker> ok, i'll check in with him
[09:12:29] <gseguin> I can pick it back up if he's busy with other things
[09:12:48] <toddparker> he'll take a quick look, then maybe push it back to you
[09:12:52] <gseguin> but last I know is that we went back to transition-property: transform
[09:13:12] <gseguin> instead of margin
[09:14:12] <gseguin> today is a jQM day for me so throw stuff at me or I'll just go through my bug list
[09:14:21] <toddparker> ok, cool
[09:14:30] <toddparker> for now, just keep cranking thru bug fixes
[09:14:38] <toddparker> or reviewing pull requests. there are a lot of new ones
[09:14:49] <gseguin> ok
[10:57:25] <gseguin> toddparker: why isn't the theme an option of $.widget or $.mobile.widget ?
[14:27:12] <ryanneufeld> hello all, I got a real stumper and could use some help
[14:27:36] <ryanneufeld> if you go to http://m.beta.metrolyrics.com/#/ and click on the share button in a browser
[14:27:38] <ryanneufeld> it works fine
[14:27:51] <ryanneufeld> but on a mobile device
[14:27:52] <ryanneufeld> nada
[15:36:28] <ryanneufeld> anyone?
[15:36:46] <ryanneufeld> toddparker? danheberden? wookiehangover?
[15:46:57] <gseguin> hi ryanneufeld, when I click on the link it's asking me for login/password
[15:47:45] <ryanneufeld> metrolyrics metrolyrics
[15:49:51] <gseguin> works on my Android 2.2
[15:50:15] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: what mobile platform are you trying it on?
[15:50:32] <ryanneufeld> nexus s/ipad/iphone/galaxy tab
[15:50:39] <ryanneufeld> (yes, I have all of those on my desk)
[15:50:59] <gseguin> what's not working?
[15:51:08] <ryanneufeld> when you click on the share button
[15:51:16] <ryanneufeld> you should get an AddThis meny
[15:51:18] <ryanneufeld> *menu
[15:51:23] <ryanneufeld> works on desktop
[15:51:26] <ryanneufeld> but not on mobile
[15:51:28] <ryanneufeld> and it should be
[15:51:34] <ryanneufeld> but the click isn't getting fired
[15:52:10] <gseguin> indeed
[15:52:59] <gseguin> can you reproduce on a jsbin?
[15:53:19] <gseguin> all your scripts are minified, it's impossible to investigate
[15:54:15] <ryanneufeld> I can try
[15:54:38] <gseguin> are you using mouseover?
[15:55:43] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: try to reproduce it in jsbin and file a ticket on github, I'll look at it
[15:55:58] <ryanneufeld> Alrighty
[15:56:01] <ryanneufeld> I'll see what I can do
[15:56:09] <ryanneufeld> would jsfiddle be alright?
[15:56:22] <gseguin> yeah, that works too
[15:57:49] <ryanneufeld> k
[15:57:57] <ryanneufeld> I prefer jsfiddle is all :p
[16:16:25] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/W9YHJ/9/
[16:20:06] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2122
[16:34:09] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: I appreciate the help man, I have to have this launched by friday at noon PST :S
[16:35:38] <gseguin> not sure I'll have time to fix that by Friday though
[16:37:15] <ryanneufeld> well, if it's a bug w/ jqm then I have a reason to post pone
[16:37:23] <ryanneufeld> but I need to know that that's the case
[16:37:42] <ryanneufeld> and I have permission to work on it with you, and contrib any efforts I make back to the project
[16:38:09] <ryanneufeld> Any how, I'll be back online at 8:30am tomorrow, it's 4:30 now where am
[16:38:18] <ryanneufeld> gotta run
[16:38:19] <ryanneufeld> thanks again
