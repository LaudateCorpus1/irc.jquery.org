[06:24:13] <deAtog> Under what circumstances should the pagebeforechange and pagechange events fire?
[07:19:48] <Wilto> deAtog: Dude, #jquerymobile. This channel is for the jQuery Mobile developers to talk to one another—we can’t do support here.
[07:20:58] <deAtog> Wilto: I'm actively working on improving jQuery Mobile.. I'm just trying to understand when those events are supposed to fire
[07:22:53] <deAtog> Wilto: sometimes it's easier to inquire about a particular feature from the developers than it is to ask other un-knowledgeable users
[07:38:38] <deAtog> Anyway back to my question, more succinctly the documentation says that the pagebeforechange and pagechange events fire during page changes. The documentation lacks an example of how to attach to these events. Other example suggest using $('#pageid').live(...).. This obviously doesn't work for objects not currently in the DOM, IE pages loaded via AJAX. The alternative is thus to use $(document).delegate(...) or $(docume
[07:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: Did the original iPhone have touch events or did it require an OS update?

[08:16:08] <Wilto> I _think_ they did, scott_gonzalez.
[08:16:27] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks Wilto. According to Doug Schepers (W3C), they did.
[08:16:29] <deAtog> Wilto: It looks like the documentation is a little light on details for the pagebeforechange, pagechange, and pagechangefailed events. These events are fired on the page container and not on the pages themselves
[08:16:43] <scott_gonzalez> I asked in several places :-P
[08:26:09] <Wilto> Sweet; good to know.
[09:00:51] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!

[09:46:13] <Wilto> johnbender: Also ping.
[10:03:30] <johnbender> kinblas: pong
[10:03:41] <johnbender> having issues with highlights
[10:03:44] <johnbender> Wilto: pong
[10:04:00] <Wilto> johnbender: No worries, dude. Sorted.
[10:04:05] <kinblas> johnbender: nevermind, was going to mention something about that base tag patch but I put it in the comments
[10:04:23] <Wilto> False alarms all around.
[10:04:26] <kinblas> johnbender: basically, it makes me nervous when folks start dorking with that stuff
[10:08:31] <gseguin> Congrats y'all!
[10:08:59] <Wilto> kinblas: https://gist.github.com/2321391
[10:09:55] * gseguin is off today
[10:13:39] <kinblas> Wilto: what is he trying to do?
[10:13:50] * kinblas notes he's assuming non-zero is portrati
[10:14:08] <kinblas> if the device is upside down (180) it will assume landscape
[10:14:44] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, just didn’t know if there was anything of value in there.
[10:16:29] <kinblas> Wilto: he also leaves the fakeHead in place?
[10:17:17] <kinblas> Wilto: so that script is about retaining the same scale when you rotate?
[10:43:16] <toddparker> hi all
[10:43:37] <tbenzige> hey toddparker
[10:45:49] <Guest27611> kinblas: yah that's why we need to come up with something that works in most cases
[10:45:53] <Guest27611> ugh!
[10:45:54] <Guest27611> wtf
[10:47:05] <Wilto> …?

[12:45:25] <deAtog> kinblas_: any additional thoughts on issue #3977
[13:01:03] <deAtog> kinblas: ping
[13:07:13] <kinblas> deAtog: pong
[13:07:38] <kinblas> deAtog: it took me a while to grok your last comment. :-)
[13:08:02] <kinblas> deAtog: if I had my way, I would've done all of this page notification stuff on the container
[13:08:14] <kinblas> so that folks had a consistent place to add their listeners
[13:08:30] <kinblas> regarding your validation question
[13:09:20] <kinblas> what's the question there? Why can't you just validate on pagebeforechange?
[13:09:37] <kinblas> is it bugging you that you have to ask the framework for the current page?
[13:10:02] <kinblas> deAtog: just trying to fully understand the question
[13:11:29] * kinblas notes he has to step into a meeting in 10 minutes
[13:13:16] <deAtog> kinblas: essentially I'm trying to make it easier to manage the context in which the events are called and the data within the pages
[13:14:23] <deAtog> in the application I'm working on right now.. I've got a basic page object which I can wrap around the jquery pages that automatically binds to the page events
[13:15:53] <deAtog> the page wrapper object is responsible for saving, loading, and validating data of a particular page..
[13:16:50] <deAtog> to my surprise, the pagebeforechange event didn't fire on the active page.. and it's the only event that is capable of preventing a page transition
[13:19:11] <kinblas> deAtog: let me preface this with, if I had my way this stuff would have been a bit more structured with classes to make it more obvious how things work.
[13:19:55] <kinblas> The way I was viewing the code was that when you call changePage() you are actually telling the page container that you want to change its current page
[13:20:05] <kinblas> you don't tell the current page that you want to change it
[13:20:26] <kinblas> this is why the events ... I agree, badly named ... are fired off the container
[13:21:03] <deAtog> kinblas: yup I understand that.. it's similar to how a tabcontrols work..
[13:21:07] <kinblas> I was also placing it there in preparation for the day when we would have multiple page containers ... ala tablet UI
[13:21:37] <kinblas> so that all said ... if an application wants to prevent a specific container for changing it's current page
[13:21:45] <kinblas> they would have to listen on the container in question
[13:22:18] <kinblas> that's where you should plug in ... now if you want to encapsulate this validation behavior in your page
[13:22:26] <kinblas> then your page object should register a listener on its container
[13:22:39] <kinblas> such that if it is the current page, and the container was just asked to switch
[13:22:55] <kinblas> it would automatically kick off your validation code, which could then prevent the change if something was invalid
[13:23:33] <deAtog> see that's where it gets messy.. because there's no good place to register that event for pages loaded via ajax
[13:24:11] <deAtog> the last thing I need is the event being fired on multiple pages..
[13:25:06] <kinblas> I'm not getting what you mean fired on multiple pages?
[13:25:28] <kinblas> when a change request is made its only fired on the page-container, not on any of the pages
[13:26:02] <kinblas> oh I see what you're saying
[13:26:23] <kinblas> you meant that if your page objects each registered themselves
[13:26:27] <deAtog> right
[13:28:06] <kinblas> deAtog: it's hard to suggest when I'm not sure what your setup is ... there are so many possibilities on how to make this work
[13:28:17] <deAtog> I think the reason the event was initially added to the container was due to the lack of "delegate" and "on" in the past..
[13:28:39] <kinblas> for example, you can make your associated page object bind/unbind for the events in question whenever it becomes the current page
[13:29:26] <kinblas> deAtog: actually it wasn't. I added it there because I was thinking object oriented. The container manages what pages are shown/hidden
[13:29:48] * kinblas notes the code isn't object oriented ... but if he had his way
[13:30:08] <kinblas> deAtog: I have to step into a meeting
[13:30:14] <deAtog> ok
[13:30:17] <kinblas> so if I don't answer right away that's why
[13:35:13] <deAtog> here's the app I'm currently working on: http://dev.itreetools.org/ellingsd/itree/home.php it's currently using a custom version of jQM that fires the pagebeforechange event on the active page rather than on the container
[13:36:07] <deAtog> One thing I noticed here is that the pagebeforechange event currently fires twice for every page when the toPage is a string identifier
[13:37:42] <deAtog> If validation were currently done in the pagebeforechange event, every page would be validated twice.
[13:39:12] <deAtog> I also noticed that changing the toPage property during the event callback can result in an infinite loop if a string is provided rather than an object.
[13:41:06] <deAtog> the loop is caused by the recursive call to changePage when toPage returned from the callback is a string
[13:42:17] <deAtog> changePage should probably be split to avoid the recursion here and prevent the event from being fired multiple times when a page changes
[13:44:49] <deAtog> the public changePage function would handle initial steps of raising the event, and ensuring that the toPage is an object, the other half would simply work with the toPage object and complete the page change
[14:05:52] <deAtog> I think the best solution is to implement pagevalidating and pagevalidated events. The other events can stay as they are or be deprecated. I'm finding it hard to present good use-cases for when someone would want to prevent page changing at the container level or to even attempt redirecting the user elsewhere. Even the pagechangefailed event is rather useless as you'll get a pageloadfailed event first.
[14:06:43] <deAtog> kinblas: I'm off for the day.. I may be back later PM me if you want to leave me a message.
