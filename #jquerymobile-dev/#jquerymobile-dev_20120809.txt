[04:53:52] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I have some idea as to why things are failing. As johnbender suggested, I had to find an event around which to synch things. It turns out that, when you load an external page, it's a good idea to wait for the pageload event before proceeding.
[04:56:12] <_|Nix|_> I'm also thinking about adding an option to detailedEventCascade that will allow it to accept a condition (a function returning true/false) that will be evaluated when a given event arrives, and if it evaluates to false, it will continue to listen for the same event until either the right event arrives, or the timeout triggers.

[07:21:29] <gseguin> Good morning
[07:21:58] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin
[07:23:14] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I may have missed it, when is the next 1.2 release planned for?
[07:24:23] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think we can decide during today's meeting
[07:24:42] <gseguin> sounds good
[07:25:03] <uGoMobi> gseguin: there are no blockers reported so toddparker already suggested to move on to beta or RC
[07:25:38] <gseguin> ok
[07:29:41] <toddparker> johnbender/uGoMobi - did you see this comment? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4663#issuecomment-7613659
[07:29:46] <toddparker> (good morning all)
[07:30:03] <uGoMobi> good morning toddparker
[07:30:25] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw that, interesting
[07:30:43] <toddparker> gseguin/uGoMobi - yep, we can decide today. if there are no blockers, we can work on preparing the next release. Since there haven't been many changes, we can probably head towards RC1
[07:31:01] <toddparker> i'd like to keep our irc meeting short (10-15 minutes)
[07:31:17] * gseguin likes
[07:32:50] <uGoMobi> if you want to try transitions on Opera... http://ugomobi.github.com/transitions/
[07:33:54] <uGoMobi> I am glad we didn't add support for that yet... Opera changed the event type OAnimationEnd to all lowercase :(
[07:34:14] <uGoMobi> took me a couple of hours to figure that one out
[07:35:45] <toddparker> so we can spend most of the time on hangout working the roadmap prioritization
[07:56:50] <toddparker> agenda - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TzitW2VunzGXRwbJDYvTZwqc6-u1tScBl1xC2Szm3sw/edit#
[07:57:18] <uGoMobi> gseguin: if I run the "support" unit test local on Chrome/Win or FF/Win test #3 detect touch fails
[08:05:35] <gseguin> hmm it was passing before I pushed
[08:05:43] <gseguin> uGoMobi: let me double check it
[08:06:43] <uGoMobi> gseguin: Jenkins don't seem to have a problem with it either... I will check on Linux later on
[08:07:41] <toddparker> uGoMobi: nice work on the opera stuff
[08:07:49] <gseguin> I get an exception
[08:07:53] <gseguin> :(
[08:07:54] <uGoMobi> thanks
[08:08:17] <toddparker> do you have a test URL I could hit with my opera
[08:08:31] <uGoMobi> toddparker: it's in the PR
[08:08:36] <uGoMobi> and ^^^
[08:08:44] <uGoMobi> 16:32 <uGoMobi> if you want to try transitions on Opera... http://ugomobi.github.com/transitions/
[08:10:56] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I don't even know how it was working
[08:11:11] <gseguin> I was overriding the property in the wrong object
[08:11:20] <gseguin> window instead of document
[08:11:24] <gseguin> fixing
[08:12:19] <uGoMobi> gseguin: strange that Jenkins let it pass

[08:20:41] <toddparker> ah, thanks
[08:21:42] <toddparker> uGoMobi: this should work in opera 12 (desktop) and latest opera mobile on android, right?
[08:23:10] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes
[08:23:59] <uGoMobi> toddparker: not sure when Opera Mobile started to support it
[08:51:20] <johnbender> toddparker: oooh that would buck nicer than a js hack
[08:51:31] <johnbender> buck -> be
[08:51:36] <johnbender> err
[08:51:41] <johnbender> buck -> be much
[08:51:48] <johnbender> man, I must be tired
[08:52:02] <gseguin> rough night?
[08:53:09] <johnbender> gseguin: well I never really sleep much so it takes me a while to get up :D
[08:53:26] <johnbender> gseguin: been studying for the gre and working on splitting core's manipultaions in two
[08:53:27] <gseguin> heh :)
[08:58:16] <johnbender> yah, time to go take a hit of coke zero
[09:08:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: toddparker: I can confirm that the css snippet works in chrome
[09:08:59] <johnbender> and I would much prefer to solve this in css
[09:16:47] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you're probably better suited to figure out the implications of this
[09:16:54] <johnbender> but if you're busy I can dive in
[09:19:28] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I will look into it
[09:19:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: thanks, and let me know if you need help
[09:19:52] <johnbender> my commit needs reverting in both places provided this will work to solve the issue
[09:19:58] <johnbender> uGoMobi: do you have a device you can reproduce it on?
[09:20:12] <johnbender> latest chrome on 4.1 has the issue
[09:21:27] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I have 4.0.3.
[09:21:41] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that should be fine then

[09:58:26] <toddparker> uGoMobi: what version of opera mobile supports transitions? 12 doesn't seem to
[09:58:37] <toddparker> no errors though, that's good

[10:45:30] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i'm not seeing the transitions working on latest opera mobile on android or desktop
[10:45:35] <toddparker> they work for you?
[11:01:01] <_|Nix|_> Ding ding ding!
[11:02:00] <toddparker> meeting time!

[11:26:29] <Wilto> Hey kinblas!

[11:26:47] <kinblas> johnbender: you rang? :-)
[11:27:36] <kinblas> johnbender: sorry was in a meeting, and my battery died, and then I was having network problems.
[11:29:10] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[11:29:26] <toddparker> alright everyone, i think a hangout will be easiest
[11:29:31] <toddparker> i'll set one up
[11:31:14] <toddparker> https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/4dfefcde5b28d6fc04dcb3e83e7203b2059c47c4?hl=en-US
[11:32:28] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I am getting a server error
[11:51:46] <agcolom> hi everyone:-) looks like the meeting finished early... toddparker: will get back into doing the api docs and will check which of the currently completed widgets need info on the various event arguments, as mentioned by scott_gonzalez, and this will be my next priority (getting the existing widgets completed with this).. I'm on holiday until the 5th Sept but should be able to get that done...
[12:24:06] <johnbender> toddparker: was that 12est or 11est?
[12:24:11] * johnbender forgets all the things
[12:26:59] <johnbender> gseguin: did we decide 12est or 11est?
[12:27:04] <johnbender> I can't recall
[12:27:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: 11
[12:27:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks
[12:27:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: At least, that's what I wrote down *shrug*
[12:28:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's what I have

[13:29:43] <toddparker> johnbender: yep, 11EST, 8am PST
[13:31:42] <toddparker> hi agcolom
[13:39:35] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: you around?
[13:39:45] <toddparker> has a question re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4791#issuecomment-7611468
[13:44:18] <toddparker> specifically: when we re-position based on orientation/re-size/etc. can we not mess with focus? I think that may solve this issue and possibly help the WP7 issue
[13:44:32] <toddparker> johnbender or gseguin - do you have an opinion?
[13:45:07] * gseguin looks
[13:49:36] <toddparker> i think this report is a dupe or very similar. also related to the focus thing in android
[13:49:37] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4797#issuecomment-7590679
[13:49:58] <toddparker> specifically, if we can re-position without monkeying with focus, it will be a big win
[13:50:19] <toddparker> on android, the keyboard actually changes the viewport height and triggers a re-position
[13:51:19] <toddparker> actually, this second issue is focus releated
[13:51:30] <toddparker> the first one is event crappiness
[13:58:18] <gseguin> For the first one is it a bleed through click problem?
[13:58:39] <toddparker> gseguin: exactly
[13:58:48] <toddparker> i think with selects
[13:59:00] <toddparker> they seems to open even tho the popup is over 'em
[13:59:14] <toddparker> i can't reproduce. I have a 2.2.2
[13:59:19] <toddparker> do you have 2.2.1
[13:59:26] <gseguin> nope
[13:59:31] <toddparker> yeah
[13:59:41] <gseguin> let me check if the folks in Palo Alto have one
[13:59:46] <toddparker> cool
[14:00:03] <toddparker> gseguin or johnbender - ideas on this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2838#issuecomment-7610259
[14:00:15] <toddparker> i need to head out but will be on tomorrow for the call
[14:00:32] <gseguin> I'll look and comment if I have something to say
[14:04:22] <toddparker> thanks!
[14:07:21] <johnbender> gseguin: we can just alter that for ourselves since we have it vendored
[14:07:42] <johnbender> and we should refernce their authors text I gues
[14:07:58] <gseguin> yeah, let's just put the tag name we picked it up from
[14:08:06] <gseguin> sure
[14:08:16] <johnbender> gseguin: 1.9.0-beta.2?
[14:08:23] * johnbender goes to look
[14:08:33] <gseguin> I think it's beta.1
[14:08:49] <johnbender> gseguin: indeed it is
[14:09:00] <johnbender> gseguin: I can do it if you're working on something
[14:09:12] <johnbender> waiting to hear back from kin on something
[14:09:48] <gseguin> not working on something specific
[14:09:56] <johnbender> gseguin: handling it
[14:10:18] <gseguin> ok
[14:10:22] <gseguin> thanks
[14:10:33] <gseguin> maybe we should put b2
[14:10:40] <gseguin> if that's where they're at
[14:10:41] <johnbender> ?
[14:10:54] <johnbender> we copied it at b1
[14:10:54] <johnbender> I thought
[14:11:19] <gseguin> yeah there is no b2
[14:12:00] <johnbender> gseguin: and the package.json has 1.9.0pre
[14:12:04] <johnbender> so beta1 it is
[14:12:28] <gseguin> check the tagged version of package.json
[14:12:54] <johnbender> gseguin: well the last tag was beta1

[15:41:30] <toddparker_> Hi all
[15:41:42] <toddparker_> On a bus, hope the wifi holds
[15:41:49] <toddparker_> What's up.
[15:42:12] <toddparker_> I can't see history for the last 2 hours do I need a refresher
[15:45:11] <gseguin> not much we handled the jquery ui version and authors
[15:45:22] <gseguin> besides that no activity here
[15:48:49] <toddparker__> Ok, great
[15:49:13] <toddparker__> Did you make any progress on either of those popup issues?
[15:49:29] <toddparker__> Or _|Nix|_
[15:49:51] <toddparker__> That focus one is a baddie
[15:53:37] <toddparker__> gseguin or johnbender / see this?
[15:53:38] <toddparker__> https://github.com/1Marc/jquery-mobile-routerlite
[15:53:59] <gseguin> No progress on popup
[15:54:12] <gseguin> yeah that router looks nice
[15:54:19] <toddparker__> Roadmap Q - should we cover routing and an optional module or keep as 3rd party?
[15:54:20] <gseguin> I didn't look at the code though
[15:54:49] <toddparker__> Pretty concise, not sure how robust it is
[15:55:02] <gseguin> I think we should talk about including routing
[15:55:03] <toddparker__> Not questioning, just don't know
[15:55:46] <toddparker__> If we can make life much easier in 100 lines if code
[15:56:06] <toddparker__> I say yeah, ESP now that we have the download builder
[16:02:06] <gseguin> exactly
[16:24:28] <toddparker_> I'll be working remotely all next week starting tomorrow but will be here, just spottier
