[07:04:12] <toddparker> johnbender: that guys had a post saying it's annoying when the scroll fires and jumps you back up: http://tucsonlabs.com/1606/hiding-the-iphone-url-bar/
[07:04:19] <toddparker> odd layout, agreed
[07:24:20] <Wilto> Whatup guys.
[07:37:54] <aaronmcadam> why does getInheritedTheme only allow a single char theme name?
[07:38:03] <aaronmcadam> I'll have to go back and change a lot
[07:38:27] <aaronmcadam> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-with-getinheritedtheme-implementation
[07:40:29] <aaronmcadam> line 1868:  ltr = ( themedParent.length && /ui-(bar|body)-([a-z])\b/.exec( themedParent.attr( "class" ) )[ 2 ] || "" ) || "";
[07:41:04] <aaronmcadam> the post says if you change it to:  ltr = ( themedParent.length && /ui-(bar|body)-([a-z]+)\b/.exec( themedParent.attr( "class" ) )[ 2 ] || "" ) || "";
[07:41:16] <aaronmcadam> adding a + after the [a-z]
[07:45:27] <aaronmcadam> looks like it's fixed in latest
[08:40:01] <johnbender> I'm going to beat this win phone 7 bug today
[08:40:24] <johnbender> and at the very least I'm going to post the js workaround I came across when I was working on it monday
[08:56:18] <toddparker> nice johnbender
[08:56:32] <toddparker> is kinblas around?
[08:56:33] <gseguin> good morning all
[08:57:32] <gseguin> toddparker: is there anything you'd like me to focus on today?
[09:03:06] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[09:03:10] <toddparker> you're back?
[09:03:23] <gseguin> yes sir
[09:03:27] <toddparker> nice
[09:03:41] <gseguin> been back since last week
[09:03:59] <gseguin> but had to catch up
[09:04:15] <toddparker> cool
[09:04:21] <toddparker> how's the baby?
[09:04:29] <gseguin> doing good
[09:04:50] <gseguin> we had some complications 2 days after being home
[09:04:59] <gseguin> but now everything is fine
[09:05:03] <toddparker> whew
[09:05:55] <toddparker> just looking thru issues
[09:05:58] <Wilto> Congrats, man!
[09:06:37] <gseguin> thanks Wilto
[09:07:01] <toddparker> so how good are you at debugging IE quikyiness with styles gseguin
[09:07:13] <gseguin> yuck
[09:07:19] <toddparker> heh
[09:07:28] <gseguin> it'll take me a while to get ready
[09:07:40] <toddparker> ok
[09:07:44] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[09:07:44] <gseguin> as at work I run OSX and don't have a VM
[09:07:53] <kinblas> toddparker: hey
[09:07:57] <toddparker> just huddling with gsegiun on what he should focus on
[09:08:14] <toddparker> i was looking thru the 1.0 list
[09:08:15] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1&milestone=10
[09:08:24] <toddparker> so many are odd style things
[09:08:33] <toddparker> or scrolling
[09:09:01] <toddparker> kin - did you get far on that centralized widget init stuff yesterday?
[09:09:17] <toddparker> if not, maybe gseguin could finish that and we could look more at event stuff
[09:11:42] <kinblas> toddparker: I didn't get far was going to do that this morning
[09:12:06] <toddparker> if you think you could explain the plan to gsegiun, maybe he could run with it
[09:12:17] <toddparker> i still want to see if we can tweak events for scrolling perf
[09:12:37] <kinblas> toddparker: sure
[09:12:57] <kinblas> toddparker: I was playing with /test/ lastnight and was noticing some wierdness on iPad
[09:13:15] <kinblas> sometimes I see the hash paths and sometimes I see full paths
[09:13:27] <kinblas> johnbender: did we disable the pushstate stuff for iOS?
[09:13:52] <kinblas> gseguin: ping me when you are ready to talk
[09:14:07] <gseguin> kinblas: ping
[09:14:11] <kinblas> heh
[09:14:13] <gseguin> :)
[09:14:32] <gseguin> skype?
[09:14:47] <kinblas> gseguin: sure
[09:16:51] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/zg2wHg
[09:16:51] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Update to set the z-index of custom select menus to stack on top of fixed toolbars. Fixes #2799. - Todd Parker
[09:18:49] <kinblas> toddparker: ok, so gseguin is all squared away
[09:18:55] <kinblas> toddparker: what did you have in mind?
[09:19:00] <kinblas> the scrolling stuff?
[09:19:30] <kinblas> that's going to involve trying to figure out how we're going to handle fastclick, buttons and some other stuff
[09:50:23] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[09:50:29] <toddparker> yeah, i guess
[09:50:57] <toddparker> my question is whether there are some smaller fixes we could tackle
[09:51:11] <toddparker> i'd just like to tinker around today and see what we can do
[09:51:15] <kinblas> ok
[09:51:33] <toddparker> great that gseguin is back and can help with that other project
[09:51:48] <toddparker> i'm just fixing some small style related issues
[09:55:10] <toddparker> so kinblas what's you take on the big ticket times slowing downy he page, script-wise
[09:55:33] <toddparker> items, not times
[09:55:47] <kinblas> toddparker: page loading? scrolling?
[09:56:24] <kinblas> toddparker: possible caching of 'n' pages
[09:57:08] <toddparker> sorry, scrolling
[09:57:59] <toddparker> i think the optimization ghislain is working on will be a solid boost to page rendering
[09:58:19] <toddparker> i don't think we can really monkey with the page cache/expiration rules right now
[09:58:25] <toddparker> which leaves us with the scrolling
[09:59:23] <toddparker> unless you see an easy. low-risk way to making dom caching configurable
[09:59:36] <toddparker> right now, it's either on or off
[10:00:02] <toddparker> but if you could pass in an integer of the # of Ajax'd pages to keep that would be the only way to add this now
[10:00:20] <toddparker> so if don cache is off the stored pages=0
[10:00:34] <toddparker> if on stored pages=infinity
[10:00:53] <toddparker> but I can set this to 2 or 3 to add a bit of a buffer for quick back button movements
[10:01:01] <kinblas> toddparker: gseguin: I filed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2853
[10:01:02] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2853 on jquery-mobile, reported by jblas (36.005s ago): Improve page enhancement performance
[10:01:55] <kinblas> toddparker: so I added a pageremove event
[10:01:56] <toddparker> great, thanks kin
[10:02:06] <toddparker> just now?
[10:02:08] <kinblas> it would be easy for someone to write a plugin to do this cache counting
[10:02:13] <kinblas> we could experiment with that
[10:02:19] <toddparker> cool
[10:02:22] <kinblas> as a plugin
[10:02:24] <toddparker> yeah
[10:02:27] <kinblas> I added it a while back ;-)
[10:02:33] <kinblas> you can cancel the pageremove event
[10:02:36] <toddparker> plugins are good
[10:02:44] <kinblas> and it will prevent the framework from pruning int
[10:02:45] <kinblas> it
[10:02:47] <toddparker> ah, gotcha
[10:03:04] <toddparker> so then you can write a plugin to check the history stack and cull pages
[10:03:11] <kinblas> right-o
[10:03:19] <toddparker> i like
[10:03:25] * gseguin is in issurance hell
[10:03:26] <kinblas> it can be a nice side-plugin
[10:03:36] <toddparker> yeah
[10:03:40] <kinblas> gseguin: ugh
[10:03:44] <toddparker> the less we add to the api, the better
[10:04:06] <toddparker> so we're back to the scrolling perf
[10:04:13] <kinblas> toddparker: I just have to say I'm very wary about dorking with click/touch events at this point
[10:04:22] <kinblas> we've got it to the point where we know what works and what doesn't :-)
[10:04:25] <toddparker> yeah, i know
[10:04:26] <toddparker> me too
[10:04:27] <kinblas> and changing stuff at the last minute
[10:04:30] <kinblas> is a can of worms
[10:04:50] <kinblas> let me poke around today to see if there are other perf type stuff we can improve
[10:04:56] <kinblas> anyone seen johnbender today?
[10:05:06] <toddparker> yeah, he's been p
[10:05:08] <toddparker> on
[10:05:14] <toddparker> working on WP7 issues
[10:05:35] <kinblas> johnbender: when you're available, there was an issue that flew by where someone was saying ipad was displaying the hash paths versus pushstate paths
[10:05:40] <toddparker> kinblas: this is still open
[10:05:41] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2107
[10:05:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2107 on jquery-mobile, reported by adriancd (3m, 1w ago): scrollSupressionThreshold - scrolling smoothness impact
[10:05:46] <toddparker> might be worth a re-visit today
[10:05:57] <kinblas> toddparker: we can't do that
[10:06:03] <kinblas> there was a reason
[10:06:12] <kinblas> oh yeah
[10:06:21] <kinblas> if you don't preventDefault on touchmove
[10:06:29] <kinblas> you will never get a swipe
[10:06:37] <kinblas> because the browser will think you want to scroll
[10:06:54] <toddparker> i see
[10:07:18] <toddparker> but if someone isn' tusking swipe events, this isn't needed?
[10:07:36] <kinblas> right, but that stuff is only on when they register for tap
[10:07:44] <kinblas> I meant swiperight
[10:07:46] <kinblas> swipeleft
[10:07:52] <kinblas> it isn't an issue if they aren't
[10:08:01] <toddparker> hmm
[10:08:21] <toddparker> did you even see a big difference?
[10:08:26] <kinblas> toddparker: did we pull the trigger on /themeroller/
[10:08:34] <kinblas> or is it still just test
[10:08:35] <toddparker> sounds like in phone gap, it makes more of a difference
[10:08:43] <toddparker> think just test
[10:08:55] <kinblas> we should ask if he is using swipeleft/swiperight
[10:09:02] <kinblas> I suspect he will never get those events
[10:09:09] <toddparker> not live: http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/
[10:11:10] <toddparker> we can close this if it's not something you can change

[11:20:19] <kinblas> toddparker: no, we'll run into the same problems
[11:20:33] <toddparker> oh, wait
[11:20:35] <toddparker> you're right
[11:20:42] <toddparker> i was thinking ajax off
[11:20:50] <kinblas> that's different :-)
[11:20:51] <toddparker> but this is still same DOM
[11:21:00] <kinblas> ajax off means new document with new scroll offsets
[11:21:26] <kinblas> ajax on means same document, same scroll offsets, up to the mercy of the browser implementation to figure out what to do
[11:21:34] <kinblas> when content changes, with differing heights
[11:21:51] <kinblas> we've seen on Opera how it doesn't adjust the scroll offset if the document gets shorter
[11:21:55] <kinblas> Opera Mini that is
[11:22:13] <kinblas> so when going from long page to short page, it looks like content disappears
[11:22:20] <kinblas> because we are scrolled down too far for the new page
[11:22:26] <kinblas> that all its content is out of the viewport
[11:23:40] <toddparker> yeah, jus responded
[11:23:44] <toddparker> brain fart.

[11:37:25] <johnbender> gseguin: we tell them to trigger a create even currently
[11:37:31] <johnbender> *event
[11:37:34] <kinblas> gseguin: the rule is that if a component adds their own markup, they are responsible for invoking the component enhancement function ... that is why our components like listview call buttonMarkup directly
[11:37:39] <johnbender> so makign an api call seems reasonable
[11:38:26] <gseguin> let's say I have autoInitialize off
[11:38:37] <kinblas> johnbender: fyi, that "enhancement request" was the non-beaking change we talked about a couple weeks back ;-)
[11:38:45] <johnbender> kinblas: yah I saw that commit
[11:38:49] <johnbender> I'm with you
[11:38:49] <kinblas> I had it sitting on a branch
[11:39:00] <gseguin> and I do dom insertions before I call init
[11:39:20] <kinblas> gseguin: uh huh
[11:39:54] <gseguin> kinblas: uh huh as in "don't do that" ?
[11:40:23] <kinblas> gseguin: as in, I'm listening
[11:40:26] <kinblas> sorry :-)
[11:41:00] <gseguin> so I guess I'm wondering when is a good time to take that snapshot
[11:41:02] <kinblas> gseguin: if they insert markup before init is triggered, we are ok
[11:41:15] <kinblas> the init is what actually triggers page creation
[11:41:24] <kinblas> which will then wake up the role plugin
[11:42:27] <gseguin> oh ok so the role plugin is triggered by "pagecreate create"
[11:42:51] <gseguin> got it
[11:43:21] <gseguin> thank you kinblas & johnbender
[11:43:34] * gseguin is off to a meeting
[11:46:47] <kinblas> gseguin: right
[12:05:49] <Wilto> Okay. So, sanity check me here, guys:
[12:07:04] <Wilto> The Android select issue seems to have something to do with the custom select retaining focus after being invoked—but it doesn’t BREAK anything unless position: fixed; is set on the collapsibles’ hidden text.
[12:07:19] <Wilto> That’s not the “sanity” part. Obviously there’s very little sane about that.
[12:08:09] <Wilto> Using position: absolute; left: -9999px; causes those initial ellipsis in FF7—likewise, right: -9999px; would put an ellipsis on the right.
[12:09:27] <Wilto> So. Since those collapsible headings seem to be hiding overflow anyway… “top: -9999px; left: 0;”?
[12:09:45] <Wilto> Any foreseeable weirdnesses?

[14:14:21] <kinblas> johnbender: in a nutshell gseguin is working on that problem of components travesing the DOM during enhancement
[14:14:25] <johnbender> ah
[14:14:50] <johnbender> one thing to keep in mind is object references can cause memory leaks when we reap pages in the dom
[14:14:56] <johnbender> that may or many not affect you
[14:15:00] <johnbender> but something to keep in mind
[14:15:19] <gseguin> BTW just using it in listview cut down rendering time in half in that listview speed test
[14:15:28] <johnbender> gseguin: sick!
[14:16:30] <Wilto> Awesome.
[14:16:45] <kinblas> gseguin: nice
[14:18:12] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #177: SUCCESS in 10 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/177/
[14:18:12] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Fixes #1077, fixes #2683 — Reverts fixed positioning to hide .ui-collapsible-heading-status (added in commit #c94c6bf). Uses ‘top: -9999px’ to hide element in lieu of ‘left: -9999px’, so as not to trigger Firefox 7’s ellipsis bug.
[14:18:13] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Fixes an issue introduced in commit #b0db8976, where lack of indexOf() was keeping IE 6/7/8 (at least) from rendering anything at all.
[14:25:30] <gseguin> alright maybe not half
[14:26:22] * kinblas was hoping for a higher number :-)
[14:26:45] <gseguin> I forgot to take network time into account in the localhost vs jquerymobile.com battle
[14:27:03] * gseguin feels stupid
[14:28:00] <kinblas> gseguin: perhaps doing a start timer end timer in pagebeforecreate and pagecreate
[14:28:06] <kinblas> might narrow things
[14:28:07] <gseguin> yup
[14:28:16] <gseguin> I was going to do that next
[14:28:41] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2629
[14:28:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2629 on jquery-mobile, reported by begmandev (2w, 6d ago): Form submit buttons don't submit the when clicking button text label
[14:28:54] <Wilto> Caused by background: transparent. OBVIOUSLY.
[14:29:00] <Wilto> my head hurts
[14:29:18] <gseguin> kinblas: also that won't work for buttonMarkup
[14:29:46] <kinblas> ??
[14:29:57] <kinblas> we just want to reduce the overall page enhancement process
[14:30:04] <kinblas> buttonMarkup should be called between
[14:30:15] <kinblas> pagebeforecreate and pagecreate
[14:30:18] <kinblas> right?
[14:30:25] <kinblas> hmmm wait
[14:30:26] <gseguin> but check the query in buttonMarkup
[14:30:33] <kinblas> I meant
[14:30:33] <kinblas> pagebeforecreate and pageInit
[14:30:57] <kinblas> oh right, the role plugin needs to look for
[14:30:59] <kinblas> inputs
[14:31:00] <kinblas> buttons
[14:31:01] <kinblas> etc
[14:31:11] <kinblas> so 2 lists
[14:31:15] <kinblas> see the bug I filed
[14:31:18] <kinblas> and assigned to you
[14:31:20] <gseguin> ok
[14:31:26] <kinblas> I think I mentioned it there
[14:31:53] <gseguin> yep
[14:32:14] <kinblas> gseguin: so basically we want to do what beta 1 did
[14:32:17] <kinblas> in the page plugin
[14:32:29] <kinblas> in terms of gathering what to enhance
[14:33:05] <gseguin> ok
[14:33:23] <kinblas> btw, I didn't mean to sound negative with the "expected more" comment above ... after thinking about it, the majority of the time after crawling, would be taken up by layout/reflow and painting of the new markup
[14:33:43] <kinblas> I was just hoping this would account for a large slice of the time
[14:33:53] <kinblas> but close to 50% is still good :-)
[14:34:04] <gseguin> I'm hoping for that
[14:58:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/4IHzOA
[14:58:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #2629, fixes #2628 — Replacing ‘background: transparent’ with #fff, rgba(255,255,255,0), and an opacity filter solves this. - Mat Marquis
[15:02:21] <toddparker> great work gseguin
[15:03:10] <toddparker> it'll be great to say we've sped up page rendering by 40 or 50%
[15:03:19] <toddparker> or whatever. no pressure
[15:03:34] <toddparker> so kinblas sorry i've been sorta heads down
[15:03:35] <toddparker> how goes it
[15:04:33] <gseguin> toddparker: you missed: <quote>I forgot to take network time into account in the localhost vs jquerymobile.com battle</quote>
[15:04:44] <gseguin> but I'm sure that there will be a perf enhancement
[15:05:11] <toddparker> yeah, saw that
[15:05:25] <toddparker> we'll just wait and see what it ends up being
[15:05:29] <kinblas> toddparker: it's going slow
[15:05:32] <toddparker> it will be better for sure
[15:05:40] <kinblas> I'm being asked for help on something internal
[15:05:44] <toddparker> i'd imagine kinblas
[15:05:45] <kinblas> so I'm a bit distracted
[15:05:52] <toddparker> ah
[15:05:56] <kinblas> toddparker: remind me where we left off?
[15:06:05] <kinblas> wanted me to look at the footer bugs on my plate?
[15:06:08] <kinblas> or the dom caching thing?
[15:06:12] <kinblas> dom caching plugin
[15:06:20] <kinblas> scrolling?
[15:06:35] <toddparker> i think you were going to look for any places where we might be able to lessen the even bindings to use other tricks to smooth out scrolling
[15:06:51] <toddparker> anything we can do will make a big difference
[15:11:42] <toddparker> do you hold out any hope kinblas
[15:16:10] <kinblas> toddparker: like I said earlier, the only way to do this is to remove all our touch handlers on document ... even one slows things down significantly
[15:16:25] <kinblas> trying to rework our event handling at this late stage is a recipe for a nightmare
[15:16:38] <kinblas> or is that disaster?
[15:16:42] <kinblas> :-)
[15:16:50] <kinblas> but I can experiment, no harm there
[15:18:13] <kinblas> toddparker: I'll resume there once I figure out an IE problem for another group
[15:19:14] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #178: SUCCESS in 11 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/178/
[15:19:15] <jqm-jenkins-bot> mat: Fixes #2629, fixes #2628 — Replacing ‘background: transparent’ with #fff, rgba(255,255,255,0), and an opacity filter solves this.
[15:46:20] <kinblas> Wilto: heh, did changing hiding from -9999px left to top really fix that bug?
[15:59:38] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm getting jaded with these bizare fixes
[15:59:53] <johnbender> did you see my workaround for the windows phone 7 select menu bug?
[16:02:08] <johnbender> it's just silly
[16:02:29] <kinblas> johnbender: no I didn't see it
[16:02:48] <johnbender> I just pull the active button class off on vmouseup
[16:02:54] <kinblas> oh was it just setting it to 0.001 opacity?
[16:02:57] <johnbender> no
[16:03:08] <kinblas> ??
[16:03:12] <kinblas> why does that fix things?
[16:03:20] <johnbender> the only two things that make a difference so far are removing the `opacity` declaration all together
[16:03:42] <johnbender> or removing the border declaration from ui-btn-active
[16:03:46] <johnbender> OR removing all the js
[16:04:01] <kinblas> what was the issue again?
[16:04:07] <kinblas> you couldn't click on the select?
[16:04:09] <johnbender> you click the native selects
[16:04:15] <johnbender> and then choose an option
[16:04:24] <johnbender> then click anywhere BUT the native select
[16:04:29] <johnbender> and it still brings up the native select
[16:04:37] <kinblas> lol
[16:04:41] <johnbender> yes
[16:04:48] <johnbender> "lol" is right
[16:04:55] <johnbender> anyway that workaround solves the issue for now
[16:05:09] <johnbender> but in trying to build a minimal reproduction I've really struggled
[16:05:16] * kinblas looks up ui-btn-active
[16:05:44] <johnbender> I'm working on that now
[16:06:33] <johnbender> Wilto: nice work on the android selects
[16:08:12] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2588#issuecomment-2535927
[16:08:13] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2588 on jquery-mobile, reported by awoni (3w, 4d ago): Windows Phone 7.5 native select menu problem
[16:08:19] <johnbender> that's the workaroudn
[16:11:02] <kinblas> johnbender: so it's not something stupid like the cursor?
[16:11:23] <johnbender> kinblas: not sure what you mean
[16:12:53] <kinblas> just trying to figure out what inside that rule is causing the problem
[16:13:08] <johnbender> kinblas: ui-btn-active?
[16:13:17] <kinblas> johnbender: was it reproduceable in IE7 on desktop?
[16:13:22] <johnbender> haven't tried
[16:13:24] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah in ui-btn-active
[16:13:27] <johnbender> its the border
[16:13:32] <johnbender> if you take out the border
[16:13:34] <johnbender> there's no issue
[16:14:36] <johnbender> kinblas: there's some other interaction here too
[16:14:59] <kinblas> johnbender: so what makes me suspicious is the heights on the select
[16:15:15] <johnbender> because if I take the enhanced markup and add in the classes that have, so far, shown to be part of the problem it doesn't work without the js
[16:15:29] <johnbender> kinblas: where
[16:15:37] <johnbender> err
[16:15:38] <johnbender> nevermind
[16:15:49] <kinblas> johnbender: looking at the styles for how we hide the select element
[16:15:54] <johnbender> kinblas: I've tried removign each and every one of those
[16:15:57] <johnbender> that was the very first thing I tried
[16:16:00] <johnbender> I had the same intuition
[16:16:10] <kinblas> ah ok .. not trying to 2nd guess you, just curious
[16:16:18] <kinblas> but IE is notorious for these types of bugs
[16:16:24] <johnbender> kinblas: not at all, it's good to talk through it
[16:16:45] <kinblas> in any case, what I was thinking that when this happens
[16:16:51] <kinblas> the 100% width/height of the hidden element
[16:17:12] <kinblas> is not the size we think it is
[16:17:40] <kinblas> what I guess I would've tried was to make the opacity of the select 0.001
[16:17:57] <kinblas> IE does wierd things with elements that are totally transparent
[16:19:24] <johnbender> kinblas: yah I tried that at your suggestion earlier to no avail
[16:25:41] <johnbender> kinblas: so this doesn't actually tell us what the issue is but if I remove 'opacity' and just use -webkit-opacity all is well
[16:25:55] <johnbender> though I have to see if opera has a vendor prefix for opacity
[16:26:26] <johnbender> kinblas: since ie 9 respects the old school filter declarations
[16:27:51] <kinblas> johnbender: so what happens if we remove the filter: and leave in opacity?
[16:27:58] <johnbender> tried that
[16:28:00] <johnbender> doesn't fix it
[16:28:01] <kinblas> we're talking Mango right? IE0?
[16:28:03] <kinblas> IE9?
[16:28:06] <johnbender> yessir
[16:28:14] <johnbender> doesn't happen in ie9 on the desktop either
[16:28:15] <kinblas> I thought Mango supports opacity?
[16:28:18] <johnbender> it does
[16:28:20] <johnbender> supports it well
[16:28:35] <johnbender> but in this case it also effs up how our select menus interact with the page
[16:28:53] <kinblas> so in mango we can use either to successfully implement opacity, but one triggers the bug and the other doesn't?
[16:29:02] <johnbender> kinblas: yes
[16:29:06] <kinblas> grrrr
[16:29:08] <johnbender> thats the way it appears
[16:29:11] <johnbender> yes
[16:29:13] <johnbender> this is the suck
[16:29:21] <kinblas> thus is the suckage
[16:29:32] <johnbender> kinblas: there's a meme generator picture for that
[16:29:41] <kinblas> heh
[16:29:47] <kinblas> I was hoping it was a conflict
[16:30:51] <johnbender> kinblas: yah those were the VERY first things I tried
[16:31:00] <johnbender> seems like that would be the problem
[16:31:26] <johnbender> then I tried commenting out chunks of the select just to see what happened
[16:31:30] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah I see the exercise in frustration
[16:31:41] <kinblas> reminds me of the good old days and IE6
[16:31:43] <johnbender> and I found that the ui-btn-active addition was also part of the issue
[16:32:05] <johnbender> kinblas: at least I can claim that I participated in similar hard times eh?
[16:32:15] <johnbender> I ain't no senator's son no
[16:32:22] <kinblas> this is the *new* hard times
[16:40:32] <johnbender> kinblas: new information
[16:40:48] <johnbender> I think I've found a third interaction
[16:40:53] <johnbender> just need to confirm it
[16:41:29] <kinblas> ??
[16:48:20] <johnbender> kinblas: removing line 122 in buttonMarkup also solves this particular problem
[16:48:57] <johnbender> the fun continues
[17:00:11] <gseguin> kinblas: I'm worried, I actually don't see any improvement in chrome
[17:00:33] <kinblas> gseguin: desktop is a bad place to test this stuff
[17:00:41] <kinblas> you have to use an actual device since they are slower :-)
[17:01:16] <gseguin> but the timing is very similar on desktop
[17:01:28] <gseguin> I'll check on the device though
[17:01:35] <kinblas> how are you generating your times?
[17:01:48] <gseguin> console.time / console.timeEnd
[17:01:59] <kinblas> but where?
[17:02:08] <gseguin> I start on pagebeforecreate
[17:02:13] <gseguin> end on pagecreate
[17:03:05] <gseguin> http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/tests/speed/test-2853.html
[17:04:43] <gseguin> looks like I'm having problems with some widgets too but that is a different problem
[19:26:10] <luxigo> i have problem with horizontal controlgroup buttons when screen is not wide enough (the buttons are outside of the window and the label colum is ...  it would be nice if onload and onresize they could transform automagically in a <select> with data-native-menu=false...
[19:26:36] <luxigo> i have problem with horizontal controlgroup buttons when screen is not wide enough (the buttons are outside of the window and the label colum is too wide...  it would be nice if onload and onresize they could transform automagically in a <select> with data-native-menu=false...
[19:26:50] <luxigo> see http://www.image-share.com/upload/1019/167.jpg
[19:28:54] <luxigo> actually if the label column keeps its normal size it would be better yet :-)
[19:44:07] <luxigo> maybe displaying the control group with negative z-index, outside of the viewport or with opacity: 0 when some data-option is set for a controlgroup, we could detect if the page width is too small and render it as a menu instead of radio buttons
[19:50:58] <luxigo> maybe the best is to render the page being loaded in a div at a z-index below the current page div (or below a blank div)
[19:55:37] <luxigo> so that the dynamically generated elements size can be checked and alternate layout can be triggered
