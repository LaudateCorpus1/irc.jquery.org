[02:26:50] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (popup): update panel example - Jasper de Groot
[02:58:33] <agcolom> Hi All, something is wrong with this page: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0-alpha.1/docs/pages/popup/popup-iframes.html
[02:58:54] <agcolom> toddparker: uGoMobi johnbender ^
[03:01:45] <agcolom> I'm going to correct that now...
[03:02:12] <MauriceG> agcolom: Hi Anne :-)  I think this is already fixed in master.
[03:02:53] <agcolom> Hi Maurice :-) ok, checking...
[03:02:54] <MauriceG> agcolom: Take a look at this last commit from todd
[03:04:07] <agcolom> yes, you're right. So I think we need a new build from johnbender :(
[03:05:05] <MauriceG> agcolom: yes.  uGoMobi also added another commit half an hour ago
[03:13:56] <agcolom> MauriceG: are you watching the Olympics?
[03:14:20] <MauriceG> agcolom: no, sorry ...  just saw a little part from the opening.  Super!
[03:22:06] <agcolom> I'm hooked! The French are doing so well!!! 4 gold medals (3 gold in swimming!)
[04:37:07] <toddmparker_> agcolom: yeah, i fixed that. my bad
[04:37:24] <toddmparker_> so i'm ready to go with the site and blog
[04:37:51] <toddmparker_> i'd like to update the build before announcing tho
[04:42:09] <toddmparker_> agcolom: saw your docs note, responded
[04:42:20] <toddmparker_> don't think it's fixable without an overhaul
[04:44:48] <MauriceG> toddmparker_: Good morning!
[04:49:17] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Hi :-)
[04:49:23] <agcolom> thanks
[04:50:10] <agcolom> I agree the examples need to be on a separate page... I'll try to get an example of what I mean...
[04:53:05] <toddmparker_> ok
[04:53:41] <toddmparker_> anyone have time to double-check this zip
[04:53:42] <toddmparker_> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0-alpha.1/jquery.mobile-1.2.0-alpha.1.zip
[04:53:56] <toddmparker_> i gave it a look, but more eyes
[05:08:13] <agcolom> toddmparker_: how about we add the control group to each of the page examples (with none highlighted as we do for custom selects?) instead of the normal link, and we change the custom select heading to custom select instead of the current select menu?
[05:10:19] <toddmparker_> those control groups are gone on the popups in master
[05:18:25] <toddmparker_> i agree they are confusing
[05:19:27] <toddmparker_> the issue is have is the control groups are used for the index/options/methods/events for all widgets
[05:19:38] <toddmparker_> so used otherwise, I think it's somewhat confusing
[05:23:24] <agcolom> or, I am proposing to change http://f.cl.ly/items/3y1v1T1m3K2l1C1W0A3d/popupimage2.tiff to http://f.cl.ly/items/2l1L402e2H1P3Q1z340H/popupimage1.tiff
[05:24:55] <agcolom> or have a simeple button saying back to popups
[05:25:04] <agcolom> simple*
[05:29:27] <toddmparker_> i see
[05:29:47] <toddmparker_> i guess the non-selected button group is ok
[05:30:00] <toddmparker_> the docs nav is just not cutting it
[05:30:10] <agcolom> I've got another example...
[05:30:21] <toddmparker_> ok
[05:32:52] <agcolom> http://f.cl.ly/items/2C1z0L000L410H3t1K2g/popupimage3.tiff
[05:34:14] <toddmparker_> either works for me. any strong opinions uGoMobi?
[05:35:04] <toddmparker_> which do you prefer?
[05:35:09] <toddmparker_> agcolom ^^
[05:36:29] <agcolom> maybe http://f.cl.ly/items/2C1z0L000L410H3t1K2g/popupimage3.tiff ?
[05:36:51] <toddmparker_> the back button style?
[05:37:09] <toddmparker_> either are better than what i did, so let's make the change so it's ready for johnbender
[05:37:53] <agcolom> ok, agreed
[05:38:13] <agcolom> yes, I like the back button one....
[05:38:37] <toddmparker_> cool
[05:38:41] <toddmparker_> both work well
[05:38:48] <toddmparker_> thanks agcolom
[05:39:02] <agcolom> no problem, thx :)
[05:39:25] <agcolom> may grab some lunch 1st....
[05:42:14] <toddmparker_> i can make the change
[05:42:27] <toddmparker_> if johnbender comes back, i want to give him the go-ahead
[05:42:48] <agcolom> all we need is <a href="index.html" data-role="button" data-transition="fade" data-icon="arrow-l" data-inline="true">Back to Popups</a>
[05:47:33] <MauriceG> toddmparker_: I as looking into the alpha.zip. Everything looks ok. Is the ajax-loader.png still needed?
[05:47:48] <MauriceG> as = was*
[05:48:22] <toddmparker_> MauriceG: nope
[05:49:32] <MauriceG> two times in the zip (\images and demos\css\themes\default\images)

[05:53:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed PNG AJAX loader image - not needed anymore - toddparker
[05:53:47] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #3919: FAILURE in 0.5 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/3919/
[05:54:07] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi
[05:54:32] <gnarf> hrm
[05:54:36] <gnarf> thats a really fast fail
[05:54:48] <toddmparker_> We need to remove the Valencia theme. That is out of date.
[05:54:53] <toddmparker_> saw that gnarf
[05:55:09] <toddmparker_> "Failed to determine"
[05:55:24] <toddmparker_> thought me deleting that image was the cause
[05:55:45] <gnarf> "Cannot allocate memory" ?
[05:55:46] <MauriceG> out of memory
[05:55:50] <MauriceG> ?
[05:55:55] <toddmparker_> bah. was going to ask that.
[05:56:02] <gnarf> that doesn't make sense
[05:56:03] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[05:56:03] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #3920: FIXED in 11 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/3920/
[05:56:04] <doesallmagic> todd: Removed PNG AJAX loader image - not needed anymore
[05:56:05] <toddmparker_> jenkins needs a lot of memory
[05:56:12] <gnarf> there is like 8 gig on that machine
[05:56:17] <gnarf> and usually > 5gig free
[05:56:20] <toddmparker_> should be plenty
[05:56:32] <uGoMobi> gnarf: I happened before this week
[05:56:33] <toddmparker_> so it's ok?
[05:56:41] <uGoMobi> it*
[05:56:41] <toddmparker_> did you do anything gnarf
[05:56:51] <gnarf> toddmparker_: just hit "build now"
[05:57:26] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sorry, I didn't have time to respond to your message yet
[05:57:29] <toddmparker_> for the 1.2 deploy or just normal business?
[05:57:37] <gnarf> http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/charts.php?sid=8e0ba53f4863f600&fullscreen=0&groupid=2&hostid=10056&graphid=421
[05:58:10] <toddmparker_> looks fine on memory
[05:59:49] <gnarf> toddmparker_: thats what I'm sayin, although there was a little spike there in used it got up to ~6gig where there would only be ~2g free
[06:00:06] <toddmparker_> odd
[06:00:15] <toddmparker_> maybe just a hiccup?
[06:01:15] <toddmparker_> be back in a few
[06:01:28] <toddmparker_> we're 100% ready for 1.2 - deploy when ready johnbender
[06:03:52] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: agcolom : back button on popup examples looks good
[06:04:45] <uGoMobi> let's take a good look at the docs navigation issues, and all other things we want to improve, later
[06:05:28] <uGoMobi> maybe we should create a branch for it to try some things out
[06:11:20] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: I ran into an issue with autodividers. For example: Having a text link tag in a static listview creates a divider, because the js searches a li for links first.
[06:16:07] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: that was supposed to be fixed for dividers
[06:17:02] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: you know what is causing the issue and how to fix it?
[06:17:25] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Would it not be sufficient to look only for the li text? I've tested this in the docs with link  and it works fine.
[06:17:36] <agcolom> oh. btw I think I ran onto a bug when I tried something today... let me try to do it again
[06:17:46] <MauriceG> link = link listview*
[06:17:46] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: do you have a fiddle?
[06:18:26] <MauriceG> no,   I create one?
[06:19:22] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I think I have an autodiver JSbin, hang on
[06:19:45] <MauriceG> yep ...
[06:24:54] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: http://jsbin.com/otepum/309/edit can you change it so it shows the issue?
[06:30:39] <uGoMobi> will be back later
[06:32:23] <agcolom> toddmparker_: btw, did you watch the olympics (swimming relay) yesterday? Well done to the USA!
[06:32:52] <agcolom> (And what amazing results for Phelps!
[06:38:52] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Listview autodividers issue with links in the text:  http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/4ud6M/
[06:50:03] <MauriceG> ?tell uGoMobi  Listview autodividers issue with links in the text:  http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/4ud6M/
[06:50:04] <bot-t> MauriceG, Okay.
[07:21:13] <toddparker> agcolom: i did. we had a good day
[07:35:12] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: what exactly is the issue in that fiddle?
[07:35:13] <bot-t> (45 mins 9 secs ago) <MauriceG> tell uGoMobi Listview autodividers issue with links in the text: http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/4ud6M/
[07:43:38] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: The autodivider looks for a link first instead of use the list item text in a static listview. - Does this not looks odd to you?
[07:47:32] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ah ok, I get it
[07:48:01] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  It has to look like this: http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/4ud6M/2/  No?
[07:48:30] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: it's done that way on purpose
[07:48:50] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: but probably links inside static LI's were not taken into account
[07:50:13] <MauriceG> but eg links for popups will be everywhere in the future !
[07:52:45] <MauriceG> and there is no need to look for links for the autodeviders at all.  If it is a linked list, the text of the link is also the text of the element. No?
[07:56:15] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yes
[07:57:45] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I don't see the need to look for anchor elements first either
[07:58:38] <toddparker> anyone seen johnbender
[08:01:43] <MauriceG> I've created a PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4781
[08:01:44] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1m, 38s ago): Listview autodividers: Fix for text links in list items
[08:01:58] <toddparker> thanks MauriceG - uGoMobi, do you have time to review
[08:02:52] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  I ran the tests very often to be sure ...
[08:03:31] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I was looking at that if ( !text ) return null
[08:03:50] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes
[08:04:20] <MauriceG> I think, there are unneeded tests now
[08:04:21] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: that looks a bit superfluous to me
[08:04:28] <MauriceG> now = then*
[08:04:57] <uGoMobi> which test?
[08:05:17] <MauriceG> listview autidividers check for links
[08:06:01] <uGoMobi> I looked at the commit message and it doesn't say why it looks for links
[08:06:46] <uGoMobi> I really think the person who added that thought listviews always contain "linked LI's"
[08:10:13] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: That was townxelliot on creation, I think.
[08:10:37] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw the commit
[08:13:15] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: you can ignore what I said about that IF statement being superfluous
[08:14:00] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: but  "if ( !text ) return null" is used for stopping
[08:14:27] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:   ah, okay.
[08:14:29] <uGoMobi> yeah, that's why it is needed and you can ignore what I said
[08:15:09] <uGoMobi> otherwise there will be an issue with that slice finction indeed
[08:15:47] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: are you going to remove that test?
[08:16:22] <toddparker> i know jQM needs to reconcile markup vs. these MVC style approaches better
[08:16:25] <uGoMobi> or change it to something else that is useful to test against
[08:16:47] <MauriceG> me?  no, never!   I don't want to get in trouble with johnbender !
[08:17:39] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: tests are just as much part of the code as anything else
[08:22:18] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  That was not serious.  But you may remember the most superfluous commit which breaks jenkins ...
[08:22:54] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: no I don't remember
[08:23:21] <MauriceG> The links in checkbox labels ?
[08:24:04] <MauriceG> anyway.  I would be happy if you look for the tests ...
[08:25:24] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: does any of the tests fail if you make this change?
[08:29:40] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: no.
[08:30:04] <MauriceG> I ran them 5 or 6 times.
[08:30:27] <MauriceG> may better: I let them run*
[08:32:22] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ok
[08:33:19] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: the "Autodividers Selector" tests need to be updated because they won't make much sense anymore
[08:37:19] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I will give that a look later to see what would be a useful test
[08:38:14] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: ok
[08:39:47] <toddparker> is gseguin around?
[08:42:46] <Wilto> You guys need anything from me pre-shipping today?
[08:43:50] <toddparker> think we're ok Wilto
[08:44:14] <toddparker> uGoMobi: when try to drag the map around here, it gets all jumpy on chrome
[08:44:15] <toddparker> http://localhost:8888/jquery-mobile/docs/pages/popup/popup-iframes.html#&ui-state=dialog
[08:44:36] <toddparker> so you see that?
[08:45:00] <Wilto> toddparker: http://wil.to/_/approval.png
[08:45:02] <uGoMobi> toddparker: taking a look on Chrome now
[08:46:24] <uGoMobi> toddparker: do you mean the map moves when you open the popup?
[08:50:47] <gseguin> now I am
[08:50:54] <gseguin> good morning folks
[08:51:05] <MauriceG> morning
[08:51:15] <uGoMobi> toddparker: if so, that is because I had the marker being centered when the map size changes
[08:51:57] <uGoMobi> because the iframe is 0 by 0 pixels on init the marker is in the upper left corner
[08:52:33] <uGoMobi> I could remove the marker
[08:52:41] <uGoMobi> hi gseguin
[08:54:01] <gseguin> hey uGoMobi
[08:54:11] <gseguin> toddparker: what can I do for you?
[08:55:01] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: I think Todd means, if he drags the map with the mouse in the open popup, the map starts to shake somehow.  With Safari I'm unable to drag the map at all.
[08:55:59] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ah ok thanks, yeah I see what you mean
[08:56:54] <toddparker> yeah, the shake when you drag
[08:57:01] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: you are German... can you review this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4780 ;)
[08:57:02] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by blowsie (3h, 40m ago): Volkswagen typo
[08:57:07] <toddparker> it keeps snapping back to the original point?
[08:57:16] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yeah I see it now
[08:57:21] <toddparker> cool
[08:57:24] <toddparker> used to work
[08:57:26] <uGoMobi> it should only center on resize
[08:57:30] <toddparker> riiiight
[08:57:59] <uGoMobi> shall I just remove the marker?
[08:58:20] <uGoMobi> then all the centering isn't needed anyway
[08:59:22] <toddparker> mat - i'd like you to at least look at the zip Thomson posted here sometime today

[08:59:29] <toddparker> AFTER docs :)
[09:00:01] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: yeah, I saw this already.   He/She is right.  The name is  Volkswagen   not wagon ...
[09:01:37] <uGoMobi> I think I am going to comment that we were referring to a cheap Chinese copy
[09:01:42] <uGoMobi> :D
[09:01:57] <MauriceG> :D
[09:02:31] <toddparker> should i add a note about how we cleaned up the events so they can be used independently  of the library?
[09:02:38] <toddparker> gseguin: you worked on that, right?
[09:03:04] <gseguin> I did with scott
[09:03:22] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez that is
[09:04:58] <gseguin> toddparker: yeah so now you can get vmouse and touch have very few dependencies
[09:05:13] <gseguin> s/you can get//
[09:05:33] * gseguin needs more coffee for a better brain to hands communication
[09:06:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/f_CE1w
[09:06:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (popup): improve map example - Jasper de Groot
[09:21:04] <johnbender> gseguin: does that mean with 1.2 people can get vmouse without other deps?
[09:21:17] <gseguin> indeed
[09:21:19] <johnbender> zomg
[09:21:21] <johnbender> amazing
[09:21:34] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi! why did you remove the map marker?
[09:21:39] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm shouting at you
[09:22:07] <toddparker> hey johnbender - hi
[09:22:10] <toddparker> what's amazing?
[09:22:21] <johnbender> toddparker: vmouse by itself from the download builder
[09:22:33] <johnbender> I can stop telling people to get it out of the library and shim define
[09:22:41] <johnbender> "just go to the download builder"
[09:23:05] <toddparker> gotcha
[09:23:12] <johnbender> toddparker: you want me to deploy?
[09:23:13] <toddparker> yeah, i think it's worth highlighting
[09:23:16] <johnbender> I just rebased to the latest
[09:23:17] <toddparker> yes please
[09:23:34] <toddparker> cool
[09:23:44] <toddparker> we're ready for you, just made some docs tweaks
[09:23:49] <toddparker> but that's now done
[09:27:43] <toddparker> so gseguin - on the events, did you work on touch.js, vmouse.js
[09:27:58] <gseguin> yes
[09:28:04] <toddparker> both
[09:28:10] <gseguin> both
[09:28:52] <toddparker> so is the message that now if you just want to use our touch events or the mouse events, you can just include the individual files
[09:29:17] <johnbender> toddparker: deployed
[09:29:23] <toddparker> johnbender: thanks!
[09:30:03] <gseguin> well... not exaclty
[09:30:12] <toddparker> help me describe this correctly
[09:30:23] <gseguin> if you're using an AMD loader yes that statement is true
[09:30:32] <toddparker> if you want to use the mouse stuff, can you just include vmouse.js?
[09:30:39] <gseguin> otherwise you have to go through the download builder
[09:30:47] <toddparker> and if you want touch, do you include touch.js and vmouse.js
[09:31:21] <gseguin> if you select touch in the builder
[09:31:27] <toddparker> in the builder, mouse and events are checked and disabled so they seem to be wrapped into core
[09:31:31] <gseguin> it will automatically include vmouse
[09:31:41] <gseguin> not in master
[09:32:04] <toddparker> where is touch?
[09:32:07] <toddparker> is see
[09:32:08] <toddparker> Virtual Mouse (vmouse) Bindings
[09:32:08] <toddparker> Normalizes touch/mouse events.
[09:32:17] <toddparker> ^^ that is checked and disabled
[09:32:28] <gseguin> no if you select latest
[09:32:34] <toddparker> ooooh, i see
[09:32:35] <gseguin> that's only in 1.1.1
[09:32:37] <toddparker> wrong version
[09:32:41] <toddparker> gotcha
[09:32:41] <gseguin> or 1.1.2
[09:33:09] <toddparker> can we add 1.2.0 alpha now?
[09:34:37] <gseguin> if we have a tag or a branch yes
[09:40:32] <toddparker> johnbender: are we tagged?
[09:40:55] <toddparker> gseguin: here is what i added to the blog
[09:40:56] <toddparker> <h2>Touch and vmouse events: Now available for standalone use</h2>
[09:40:56] <toddparker> We've decoupled all of our plugins and have a clear dependency map which allows us to offer the <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/">download builder tool</a> (Alpha) to let you build the leanest package possible. However, we heard that some developers just wanted to grab the virtual mouse events that normalize between touch and mouse inputs (vmouse) or the touch events like swipe or touchstart but
[09:40:57] <toddparker> don't want to use the rest of the jQuery Mobile library. In this latest release, we've refactored a bit to eliminate the dependency on mobile core for utilities like these. Now if you want to take advantage of just our vmouse events, simply check that box in the download builder and grab the file.
[09:40:58] <toddparker> This additional decoupling is only available if you choose <strong>1.2.0 alpha or latest</strong> in the version dropdown of the <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/">download builder tool</a>.
[09:43:14] <gseguin> and they will probably want to rename the output file since it will be named jquery.mobile.js
[09:43:26] <gseguin> but yeah that's basically it
[09:44:37] <toddparker> gotcha. so we concat the build output into a file called that
[09:44:38] <toddparker> it's ok
[09:44:41] <toddparker> cool
[09:44:53] <johnbender> toddparker: we are not tagged
[09:44:57] <toddparker> Other utilities like orientationchange and throttledresize are also available without the core requirement in the builder.
[09:45:18] <toddparker> johnbender: think we're ready to tag, go for it
[09:45:27] <toddparker> i am ready to announce
[09:46:43] <toddparker> as soon as you tag, gseguin can update the builder
[09:51:54] <toddparker> gseguin:
[09:52:14] <toddparker> is it as easy as just tagging master as 1.2.0-alpha-1
[09:52:35] <toddparker> johnbender: are there more things that need to be done when you tag?
[09:55:18] <gseguin> toddparker: yes for the utilities
[09:55:52] <gseguin> toddparker: so you want alpha out without that fix I was working on?
[09:56:11] <toddparker> sorry, what fix gseguin
[09:56:13] <gseguin> that's cool with me
[09:56:17] <toddparker> missed that
[09:56:23] * gseguin retrieves it
[09:56:42] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4760
[09:56:42] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gseguin (5d, 1h ago): Proposed fix for #4721: Added a "listviewbeforefilter" event
[09:57:01] <toddparker> figure we can add more fixes after alpha but before rc
[09:57:13] <toddparker> right, that can go in after
[09:57:17] <gseguin> yeah, totally cool
[09:57:31] <toddparker> i'd rather not make any last minute code changes. learned my lesson
[09:57:34] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker: let's not forget to deprecate filterCallback for filter
[09:57:51] <johnbender> before we release 1.2
[09:57:54] <toddparker> we need to add that to the docs
[09:57:55] <gseguin> yeah
[09:58:11] <toddparker> i'd also like to have a wiki page with upgrade notes. should be added there
[09:58:24] <toddparker> so - tag time?
[10:01:58] <johnbender> toddparker: sure
[10:02:15] <toddparker> cool, lemme know
[10:04:28] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/UTWHqw
[10:04:28] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] bump version to 1.2.0-alpha.1 - John Bender
[10:04:50] <johnbender> toddparker: done
[10:05:09] <gseguin> toddparker: on it
[10:05:58] <toddparker> thanks guys
[10:06:01] <toddparker> announcing now!
[10:11:57] <gseguin> toddparker, johnbender: stable or unstable?
[10:12:15] <gseguin> should the builder still default to 1.1.1?
[10:13:19] <Wilto> Awww yeah.
[10:13:23] <gseguin> toddmparker_: stable or unstable?
[10:13:39] <Wilto> Todd just stepped out.
[10:13:42] <gseguin> ah darn, sorry wrong todd
[10:13:46] <gseguin> oh ok
[10:15:15] <Wilto> I think it should still default to 1.1.1.
[10:17:11] <johnbender> I agree the default shouldn't be the alpha
[10:17:24] <johnbender> some percentage of people will just ignore the select
[10:27:59] <gseguin> ok
[10:28:13] <gseguin> now how do I log in to jquerymobile.com /cc gnarf
[10:28:46] <gseguin> danheberden: ^
[10:28:46] <gnarf> gseguin: you should be able to ssh there
[10:28:58] <gnarf> gseguin@jquerymobile.com
[10:28:59] <gseguin> using which user?
[10:29:01] <gseguin> oh ok
[10:29:06] <gnarf> or jqadmin if you had access on the old one
[10:29:29] <gseguin> Permission denied (publickey).
[10:30:58] <gnarf> gseguin: try again?
[10:31:18] <gseguin> $ ssh gseguin@jquerymobile.com
[10:31:18] <gseguin> Permission denied (publickey).
[10:31:32] <gseguin> jqadmin works though
[10:31:39] <gnarf> so
[10:38:40] <MauriceG> ?tell toddparker What a cool blog post 1.2.0. Looks really nice!   One issue: The link "options" down under the popup paragraph calls the "events" page.
[10:39:41] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I removed the marker for now because there was an issue with getting the marker in the center of the map
[10:46:38] <gseguin> toddparker: I'm trying to figure out how to update the builder on jquerymobile.com
[10:46:44] <gseguin> I don't have access right now
[10:46:47] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, but the last time I tried, the marker moved to the center and it looked reaaly good@
[10:46:53] <agcolom> !*
[10:46:59] <gseguin> gnarf is aware of it
[10:47:13] <agcolom> so it looked like you had fixed the issue
[10:47:31] <agcolom> was it that it was not working on all browsers?
[10:49:48] <MauriceG> johnbender: the zip at http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0-alpha.1/jquery.mobile-1.2.0-alpha.1.zip  contains the code from yesterday
[10:50:04] <johnbender> MauriceG: thanks
[10:50:28] <gseguin> toddparker: builder updated to show 1.2-alpha.1 as one of the sources
[10:51:33] <johnbender> MauriceG: it should update in a few minutes
[11:03:05] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/08/01/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-2-0-alpha/
[11:04:39] <MauriceG> johnbender: tested: ok! Latest changes are in.  Thank you!
[11:04:54] <MauriceG> toddparker: ^^
[11:08:49] <toddparker> hi all - back from lunch
[11:09:22] <toddparker> gseguin: we should default to latest stable (1.1.1)
[11:10:03] <gseguin> toddparker: yep still the case
[11:10:36] <agcolom> toddparker: Chris is very happy with the blog post! (I sent him a DM) (re FF for Android!)
[11:15:40] <toddparker> agcolom: great
[11:15:46] <toddparker> hopping into a meeting
[11:15:52] <toddparker> thanks everyone!
[11:16:20] <MauriceG> toddparker: did you see my note above?    The link "options" down under the popup paragraph calls the "events" page.
[11:20:36] <toddparker> MauriceG: thanks
[11:24:28] <MauriceG> toddparker: You're welcome.   I don't want to be pedantic, but the image title of the the collapsible-list  is wrong.
[12:10:47] <gseguin> upgrading jquery.ui.widget to beta-1
[12:16:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/aBcXQA
[12:16:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Upgrade widget factory to 1.9 beta version - FIxes #4629 - Ghislain Seguin
[12:40:22] <toddparker> MauriceG: fixed that blog post
[12:50:45] <johnbender> gseguin: I would just run a couple of the widget test suites to see what happens and then push to the CI
[12:53:02] <uGoMobi> toddparker: nice blog post, including the graphics!
[12:54:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, I added some code to map to center the marker, but somehow that made it impossible to drag the map
[12:54:45] <uGoMobi> will look into that and put the marker back when it works as expected
[13:02:00] <agcolom> uGoMobi: strange! I was really impressed when I saw the map move and position the marker in the center ;-) It looked really good!
[13:02:50] <gseguin> johnbender: I ran the demo and it looked ok
[13:02:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: haha... the issue was that when you try to drag the map it keeps centering the marker
[13:02:56] <gseguin> so I pushed
[13:03:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: while it should only happen when the map is resized
[13:03:47] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Ah! I see!!!! I didn't try that! So the event that recenters was being fired on drag!
[13:04:04] <agcolom> sure! That's an interesting problem!
[13:04:41] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, while Google info said it the event fires when the canvas size is changed
[13:04:56] <uGoMobi> maybe a bug, or maybe something I missed
[13:05:23] <agcolom> yes, these maps can be tricky!
[13:06:05] <agcolom> I'll look on the web if someone else has reported similar problems....
[13:21:32] <johnbender> gseguin: the demo?
[13:25:53] <gseguin> johnbender: docs
[13:27:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think I misunderstood the event that I was binding to
[13:32:32] <johnbender> gseguin: did you push the update?
[13:38:34] <gseguin> johnbender: I did
[13:39:31] <johnbender> gseguin: cool, tests passed
[13:39:53] <johnbender> gseguin: are we doing all this stuff in master or a 1.2.1 branch?
[13:40:24] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[13:40:58] <gseguin> unless we start working on 1.next, I'm guessing master
[13:41:26] <johnbender> gseguin: so we're going to include the new widget in the 1.2 beta?
[13:41:32] <johnbender> or alpha 2?
[13:42:09] <johnbender> might be risky given that it's beta
[13:43:27] <gseguin> the target version was 1.2
[13:43:45] <gseguin> the changes are pretty minor actually
[13:44:15] <gseguin> most of it is an abstraction layer for the bind->on change in jQuery
[13:44:35] <gseguin> which we should do as well
[13:47:20] <johnbender> gseguin: right, all backward compat changes are meant to be non breaking
[13:47:55] <johnbender> the question is more "is code change ok outside of bug fixes past alpha?"
[13:48:10] <johnbender> and we still need another branch to work on features for 1.3
[13:48:13] <johnbender> or something
[13:48:27] <gseguin> it was targeted for 1.2
[13:48:33] <johnbender> k
[13:48:45] <gseguin> it's just that I didn't have time to do it
[13:48:53] <johnbender> what's the plan for the branch
[13:49:12] <johnbender> feature branches until we release?
[13:49:20] <johnbender> toddparker: gseguin ^
[13:49:42] <johnbender> I've been doing some slider refactoring
[13:49:52] <johnbender> though i'm not sure how much more i'll do
[13:51:51] <gseguin> I think feature branches until beta
[14:13:58] <gseguin> johnbender: re that filterCallback deprecation
[14:14:14] <gseguin> how did you want to name it?
[14:16:58] <johnbender> gseguin: filter
[14:17:06] <johnbender> that's what I was thinking at least
[14:17:13] <gseguin> it's already there
[14:17:16] <gseguin> as a boolean
[14:17:22] <johnbender> brutal
[14:17:22] <gseguin> not sure it's used though
[14:18:05] <gseguin> I think it's not used
[14:18:19] <johnbender> gseguin: good
[14:20:00] <gseguin> johnbender: why did you want the item as the first param?
[14:20:09] <gseguin> of the filter function

[14:44:15] <toddparker> hiall
[14:44:20] <toddparker> back form my meeting
[14:45:09] <toddparker> out of my meeting now
[14:45:26] <toddparker> nothing seems to have blown up from 1.2 so far
[15:01:05] <johnbender> toddparker: one massive advantage of small frequent releases is that new code doesn't stay hidden, accruing bugs for very long
[15:01:21] <johnbender> tell people about the release gets them testing
[15:01:36] <johnbender> as long as you put some insentive in there like a new widget and other features

[15:47:14] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by cjindustries (3m, 1w ago): Fix for issue #4133 - check all items on each change when custom filter callback applies
[15:48:14] <gseguin> the logic he's using to detect a custom handler would work if we have .filter = .filterCallback = myDefaultFilter;
[15:48:50] <gseguin> but if .filter != .filterCallback then it's going to be messy
[16:00:04] <johnbender> gseguin: messy indeed
[16:00:19] <johnbender> gseguin: but I would just check if either of them is the default
[16:00:32] <johnbender> in the case that they aren't prefer the old one then the new one
[16:01:11] <johnbender> that is, I'm fine with messy
[16:01:19] <johnbender> see the loader widget for an example

[16:13:11] <johnbender> a little treat for myself
[16:13:23] <johnbender> should I work on speeding up refresh?
[16:32:55] * gseguin is on crack
[16:33:06] <gseguin> johnbender: .filter is used
[16:41:02] <johnbender> gseguin: durn
[16:41:10] <gseguin> yeah
[16:43:17] <johnbender> gseguin: only in that one spot though eh?
[16:43:25] <johnbender> won't that still work if you override it with a function?
[16:43:58] <gseguin> not sure what you mean
[16:44:14] <gseguin> it gets set by the data-filter="true"
[16:44:37] <johnbender> ah, right it would turn all lists into filtered lists
[16:44:46] <johnbender> I was thinking you could define it on the prototype
[16:45:14] <gseguin> yeah no, that ain't gonna work
[16:45:38] <johnbender> gseguin: $( "li" ).listview( "options", "filter", function() { }); ?
[16:46:32] <johnbender> gseguin: you have to do that now if you want to customize the filter for a single listview anyway
[16:46:50] <johnbender> I think at leats
[16:46:52] <johnbender> *least
[16:46:56] <gseguin> true
[16:47:09] <gseguin> but then what would be the prototype property ?
[16:47:31] <johnbender> false
[16:47:50] <johnbender> or true
[16:47:52] <johnbender> doesn't matter
[16:47:59] <gseguin> so what if you want to set the filtering function for all listviews
[16:48:01] <gseguin> ?
[16:48:08] <johnbender> set filter = function
[16:48:14] <johnbender> ah
[16:48:18] <johnbender> well
[16:48:38] <gseguin> all filtered listviews that is
[16:48:39] <johnbender> I'm sure there are people who set it for all lists but don't turn all lists into filtered lists
[16:48:48] <johnbender> in which case that wouldn't work
[16:51:44] <johnbender> gseguin: other than filter I have no ideas
[16:51:48] <johnbender> literally nothing
[18:54:22] <toddmparker_> johnbender: speeding up refresh or anything > YES
[18:55:23] <toddmparker_> we can discuss branch strategy tomorrow
[18:55:43] <toddmparker_> but since we're at alpha, I think it's ok to keep refining and adding
[18:55:51] <toddmparker_> so master
[18:56:32] <toddmparker_> but if things are pretty quiet on issues after a week or so, i'd like to freeze the code and do a quick beta before moving on to rc's
[18:58:02] <toddmparker_> i'd like to get the filter improvements in for 1.2
[18:58:29] <toddmparker_> slider cleanup too
[23:47:06] <_|Nix|_> Wow! Awesome job on the popup docs! Really awesome!
