[06:20:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/out-in-transition] Much of the scripting in nav.js's transitionPages function was tied to the animation sequence for our css3transitionhandler. For example, the order was, scroll to top, run transitions, then scroll to the remembered location of the new page (there's more involved, but that's the gist of it). If we want to expand beyond this sequence, much of that scripting needs to move to the css3transitionhandler

[08:30:01] <johnbender> kinblas: I think I've finally sorted this out
[08:30:11] <Wilto> Paging Doctor Bender. Doctor johnbender.
[08:30:15] <johnbender> and, I haven't felt this dumb in a good long time
[08:30:17] <johnbender> Wilto: yo
[08:30:23] <Wilto> Oh, hey.
[08:30:24] <kinblas> johnbender: heh
[08:30:51] <Wilto> I’m seeing a very odd regression introduced during your commits post-AMD-merge.
[08:31:00] <johnbender> :(
[08:31:10] <johnbender> Wilto: did you do a bisect and hit one of them?
[08:31:13] <Wilto> One sec; screenshotting.
[08:31:44] <johnbender> Wilto: if not and it's really easy to verify it might be a good time to try out bisect
[08:31:47] <johnbender> if you haven't already
[08:32:25] <johnbender> brb
[08:32:41] <Wilto> Yeah, I’m gonna take a stab at that now—I was just manually rolling back to old commits.
[08:32:43] <Wilto> http://wil.to/double-border.png
[08:33:35] <Wilto> No errors, no nothing. Just… Weird doubled borders, but only when the initial page load is on the index page. Didn’t know if this would ring a bell for whatever reason.
[08:34:09] <toddmparker_> johnbender: wilto and I both did that submodule thing
[08:34:14] <toddmparker_> would that affect this?
[08:34:27] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, meant to mention that.
[08:34:34] <toddmparker_> i seem to remember there was something we needed to do to undo that
[08:34:39] <toddmparker_> might be on our end
[08:42:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: submodule thing?
[08:42:24] <toddmparker_> ya
[08:42:30] <toddmparker_> could that cause this?
[08:42:34] <Wilto> Updating submodules for the AMD stuff.
[08:42:45] <Wilto> Prior to the change that made it unnecessary.
[08:42:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto I still don't know what you mean :(
[08:43:15] <johnbender> did you update dependencies?
[08:43:27] <johnbender> have you tried going back to the old include?
[08:43:33] <johnbender> that still works just fine
[08:43:45] <johnbender> and if that remedies the issue it may be a load order problem
[08:43:56] <johnbender> kinblas: let me know if you have time for me to run this change by you
[08:44:05] <johnbender> the issue is clear but the solution probably needs review
[08:44:21] <toddmparker_> do we need to run this now: https://gist.github.com/9c06a3ff4c22431f7a53
[08:44:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: AH!
[08:44:38] <toddmparker_> we did update deps, yeah
[08:44:48] <johnbender> yah I would run that if you guys haven't already
[08:44:49] <toddmparker_> so do we need to do that mumbo jumbo to undo?
[08:45:00] <johnbender> on master only
[08:45:16] <johnbender> gseguin: we can delete the amd and almond branches eh?
[08:47:44] <kinblas> Wilto: on that screen shot, maybe I'm not seeing it, but where is the double border? Is it the active/selected API item?
[08:48:24] <kinblas> oh, I get it it's doubled so it's pushing the right side out of view? Or is that just a cropped screenshot?
[08:48:26] <johnbender> Wilto: yah and that's not likely caused by the submodule
[08:49:26] <johnbender> Wilto: I actually wondered about that when I first started looking at the branch, I guess I thought it might just be me
[08:50:20] <Wilto> Cropped—it’s just the double-width borders. And it only appears when you load the index page and start navigating.
[08:50:32] <Wilto> Which is… Strange, and seems wholly unrelated to the AMD commits.
[08:50:48] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: I would say it's caused by a load order issue but when I switch back to the old way of including the js it's the same
[08:51:05] <Wilto> Yeah; it’s weird. I’m slogging my way through a bisect now.
[08:51:18] <johnbender> Wilto: yay bisect!
[08:51:31] <johnbender> so you found a commit where it wasn't an issue?
[08:52:16] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:52:34] <gseguin> johnbender: yes you can delete these branches
[08:52:41] <johnbender> deleting
[08:54:47] <toddmparker_> my theory is that the css may be concat in the wrong order?
[08:54:58] <toddmparker_> if i reload the homepage, i see the double border
[08:55:01] <toddmparker_> do you?
[08:55:25] <toddmparker_> if i then navigate in, say to "buttons" and hit refresh i see the single line again
[08:55:30] <johnbender> gseguin: we didn't do anything with the css right?
[08:55:33] <toddmparker_> going back home, looks ok
[08:55:36] <johnbender> I think we punted on using that plugin
[08:55:39] <toddmparker_> hmm
[08:56:04] <toddmparker_> so the css of list items on the homepage isn't getting the negated bottom border (0px)
[08:56:11] <gseguin> just replaced the combine.php by css @import
[08:56:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[08:56:45] <toddmparker_> you asking me to do that?
[08:56:52] <Wilto> …Think I got it.
[08:56:55] <johnbender> that's what he did I think
[08:57:00] <toddmparker_> i see
[08:57:06] <toddmparker_> what's that Wilto?
[08:57:19] <kinblas> toddmparker_: in your last reply to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3217#issuecomment-3432498
[08:57:20] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3217 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1m, 6d ago): Page transition re-think: Smoother, faster
[08:57:25] <Wilto> Index is using 	<link rel="stylesheet"  href="css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css" />, everywhere else is using <link rel="stylesheet"  href="../../css/themes/default/" />.
[08:57:32] <gseguin> I just saw a retweet from jrburke this morning that a guy is working on a plugin for r.js to handle css as well
[08:57:34] <kinblas> toddmparker_: did you mean that things get "worst" in landscape? Or "better" as you stated?
[08:58:13] <toddmparker_> ??
[08:58:14] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I only ask because in general, adding pixels to the width causes more blinking
[08:58:23] <toddmparker_> in the issue? blog?
[08:58:28] <Wilto> Who needs “git bisect” when one has good ol’-fashioned visual diff/cursing under one’s breath!

[08:58:37] <toddmparker_> yeee ha
[08:58:37] <kinblas> toddmparker_: your last comment in the issue
[08:58:46] <johnbender> gseguin: nice
[08:58:49] <toddmparker_> ah
[08:58:55] <toddmparker_> i'll look kinblas
[08:59:38] <toddmparker_> kinblas: this? "One side benefit: Android 3.0 is a train wreck with transitions so if you switch to landscape, things improve dramatically."
[08:59:54] <toddmparker_> ...because we switch to none in landscape
[08:59:58] <kinblas> toddmparker_: oh you meant with the new transitions
[09:00:03] <toddmparker_> ya
[09:00:09] <kinblas> I thought you were trying to tell him how bad things were
[09:00:18] <kinblas> with animations/transitions on 3.x
[09:00:33] <kinblas> toddmparker_: nevermind then :-)
[09:00:43] <toddmparker_> i just edited for clarity
[09:01:01] <toddmparker_> that 1,000px threshold is tricky.
[09:01:07] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ok, because with the older transitions things get worst in landscape
[09:01:08] <toddmparker_> funny, we've always done this
[09:01:15] <toddmparker_> in the docs anyway
[09:01:25] <toddmparker_> right, of course
[09:01:47] <toddmparker_> i wonder if all the 3.0 tablets will be upgraded to 4.0?
[09:01:48] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah, that always threw me off ... like "why did transitions stop working?" I always chalked it up to dropped frames
[09:01:55] <toddmparker_> 3.0 seems like a half-baked mistake
[09:02:00] <toddmparker_> heh
[09:02:15] <toddmparker_> well, we can bump it up to 1024 or more
[09:02:19] <Wilto> s/3\.0/Android
[09:02:27] <toddmparker_> but a flip makes me wince at that size
[09:02:30] <Wilto> Not that I’m bitter.
[09:02:31] <kinblas> toddmparker_: btw, the phonegap folks sit like 15ft away from me now
[09:02:38] <toddmparker_> feel like i need to duck
[09:02:48] <toddmparker_> yeah? say hi to the bros
[09:03:01] <kinblas> yeah getting input/help should be a bit easier
[09:03:18] <toddmparker_> i would like to start looking at how to make app dev easier now...what if PE isn't a concern
[09:03:41] <Wilto> BLASPHEMER
[09:03:45] <kinblas> lol
[09:04:00] <toddmparker_> now that scott is gone, let's generate everything with JS
[09:04:00] <kinblas> Wilto: heh I was like woah ... did Todd just say that?
[09:04:08] <kinblas> lol
[09:04:08] <toddmparker_> or Flash Lite
[09:04:23] <Wilto> DAMMIT, TODD
[09:04:33] <toddmparker_> html is for loozers
[09:04:43] <Wilto> Trufax.
[09:04:46] <kinblas> toddmparker_: at least things would be consistent across platforms/devices :-P
[09:04:58] <toddmparker_> nah, jsut wondering if we shoudl have simple support for page params, that kinda stuff
[09:05:18] <johnbender> kinblas: let me know when you have a second
[09:05:23] <toddmparker_> beef up our docs with examples, etc.
[09:06:22] <kinblas> johnbender: now's a good time before I get sucked into muse debugging
[09:06:34] <johnbender> kinblas: so I wanted to talk about the hash handling
[09:06:44] <kinblas> johnbender: ya mon
[09:06:45] <johnbender> just walk someone else through it and then have you review my solution
[09:06:47] <johnbender> cool
[09:06:47] <johnbender> so
[09:06:50] <johnbender> the problem is this
[09:07:01] <johnbender> when the brower goes back or forward
[09:07:08] <johnbender> it pops the state and changes the url
[09:07:12] <kinblas> johnbender; btw, a diagram of how that pushstate plugin works would be good
[09:07:25] <johnbender> I've thought about that
[09:07:45] * johnbender adds diagram to his todo list
[09:07:49] <johnbender> anyhow
[09:07:52] <johnbender> it pops the state and changes the url
[09:08:04] <kinblas> right
[09:08:05] <johnbender> so when that url change happens it will obviously sometimes trigger a hashchange
[09:08:11] <johnbender> *sometimes*
[09:08:17] <johnbender> because sometimes it doesn't
[09:08:28] <kinblas> sometimes it doesn't contain a hash
[09:08:31] <johnbender> right
[09:08:50] <johnbender> so our previous solution was to swallow ANY hash change
[09:08:53] <johnbender> and if there wasn't one
[09:08:57] <johnbender> we had a cleanup timeout
[09:09:11] <johnbender> that would eventually UNLOCK our hashchange handling
[09:09:40] <Wilto> I read that as a line from a text-based adventure game.
[09:09:45] <johnbender> that "cleanup" timeout has to come after the hashchange because if it came before it would unlock the hashchange handling and allow the spurious hashchange
[09:09:53] <Wilto> “To reach the CASTLE you must first UNLOCK hashchange handling.”
[09:10:00] <kinblas> johnbender: right
[09:10:06] <johnbender> which was the problem
[09:10:10] <kinblas> right
[09:10:17] <johnbender> at 100ms in FF I was seeing the hashchange second in some cases
[09:10:17] <kinblas> johnbender: so that got me thinking yesterday
[09:10:36] <johnbender> kinblas: well hold one sec
[09:10:55] <johnbender> so my solution is to "know" that there will be a hashchange
[09:11:13] <johnbender> because if we just extend the timeout it blocks _all_ hashchange handling for 200ms and still provides no guarantee
[09:11:44] <kinblas> uh huh
[09:11:46] <johnbender> I find out if there's a hashchange by looking in the history stack
[09:11:55] <johnbender> because that hasn't been updated when we get the popstate
[09:11:55] <kinblas> ding ding
[09:12:04] <kinblas> that's what I was thinking about
[09:12:06] <johnbender> do a quick resetKeys
[09:12:10] <johnbender> and I can tell if there's a hash
[09:12:30] <johnbender> the only corner case I have to check
[09:12:43] <johnbender> is if the two urls happen to have the same hash
[09:12:55] <johnbender> will it trigger a hashchange
[09:13:02] <kinblas> it won't
[09:13:13] <johnbender> that's what I'm thinkin
[09:13:26] <johnbender> which means I need to _not_ disable hashchange in that case
[09:13:50] <kinblas> johnbender: so one question if I may
[09:13:59] <johnbender> thats why I asked :D
[09:14:39] <kinblas> johnbender: if the user hits the back button rapidly (like 2 or 3 times) ... does pop-state fire 2 or 3 times? Or are they coalesced into a single event?
[09:14:53] <kinblas> if coalesced that would throw us off
[09:15:04] <johnbender> kinblas: from what i've seen it fires the same number of times
[09:15:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/pQwNNA
[09:15:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixed theme CSS inclusion on docs index. - Mat Marquis
[09:15:14] <johnbender> I just pray that's the case everywhere :(
[09:15:21] <johnbender> Wilto: what was it?
[09:16:42] <johnbender> kinblas: in general I don't like relying on our version of history
[09:16:50] <kinblas> johnbender: I think hashchanges might be coalesced in some cases, we might need to write some basic test cases
[09:16:50] <johnbender> it's all too easy for that to get out of sync
[09:17:00] <kinblas> johnbender: I agree
[09:17:10] <kinblas> johnbender: can't you look at the pushstate stack too?
[09:17:28] <johnbender> kinblas: dunno, that would be neat, though in this case I don't think it would help
[09:17:36] <johnbender> since I need to know the last page
[09:19:22] <kinblas> johnbender: You can get the previous and next urls in the stack
[09:19:36] <johnbender> kinblas: that wouldn't be much of a stack then eh?
[09:19:46] <johnbender> :P
[09:19:58] <kinblas> johnbender: well, it's a peek into the stack
[09:20:06] <johnbender> kinblas: true!
[09:20:10] <kinblas> history.current (current URL)
[09:20:15] <kinblas> history.next (next URL)
[09:20:22] <kinblas> history.previous (prev URL)
[09:20:28] <kinblas> history.state (current state object)
[09:20:32] <johnbender> kinblas: nice
[09:20:39] <kinblas> oh doh
[09:20:44] <kinblas> it's non-standard
[09:20:48] <johnbender> gah
[09:20:51] <kinblas> proposed by mozilla
[09:20:58] <johnbender> IT WOULD BE SO NICE
[09:21:05] <kinblas> I need to check HTML5
[09:21:09] * johnbender takes a page from Wilto's book
[09:21:11] <kinblas> sorry was looking on mozilla.org
[09:21:28] <johnbender> WHY CAN'T THEY THINK OF THIS STUFF UP FRONT!
[09:23:25] <kinblas> johnbender: bah "The actual entries are not accessible from script."
[09:23:31] <kinblas> http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/history.html#joint-session-history
[09:24:28] <Wilto> What are we doing?
[09:24:34] <Wilto> Referring to the spec?
[09:27:10] <kinblas> Wilto: trying to see if we could look at the prev/next entries in the pushstate stack
[09:27:15] <johnbender> Wilto: wishing upon a star
[09:27:17] <kinblas> aka the history object
[09:27:29] <johnbender> kinblas: I can see the security implications of allowing access to all history
[09:27:30] <Wilto> Ahh, you’re doing that voodoo that I do so mediocre.
[09:27:36] <kinblas> johnbender: true dat
[09:27:39] <johnbender> but current state storage seems like sucha freebie
[09:27:47] <johnbender> "sucha freebie

[09:36:46] <kinblas> Wilto: toddmparker: what was this zoom/orientation fix thing I keep hearing about that scottjehl worked on a few days ago? Was that the thing that had to do with inputs getting focus causing a zoom level that the user gets left at when they are done typing?
[09:51:55] <johnbender> kinblas: tests are green
[09:52:56] <kinblas> great!
[10:01:26] <johnbender> kinblas: one both firefox and chrome it appears to fire the events individually no matter how fast I click
[10:01:46] <johnbender> kinblas: any idea where I might find me some coalesced popstatage?
[10:01:54] <kinblas> for popstate? or hashchange?
[10:02:07] <johnbender> popstate
[10:02:19] <johnbender> well I should say popstates we handle
[10:02:31] <johnbender> since we ignore any without our state object
[10:02:42] <kinblas> johnbender: I seem to remember writing a test that showed some events get coalesced on at least page loading
[10:02:43] <johnbender> but those are the only kind we care about
[10:02:45] <kinblas> hang on a sec
[10:02:48] <johnbender> kk
[10:03:05] <johnbender> I'm glad I pursued this one
[10:03:19] <johnbender> I was ready to call it a load order issue and get back to it
[10:03:34] <johnbender> sad that it took this long to figure out though :(
[10:05:46] <kinblas> johnbender: eh these things always take a long time to figure out .. anyways it's good to have someone understand  it and the mechanics involved
[10:06:12] <johnbender> it certainly makes a case for sorting bugs out at the time you find theem
[10:06:26] <Wilto> Nah, kinblas. That was a separate thing we were messing with—that doesn’t seem particularly solvable.
[10:06:35] <johnbender> though I think the decision at the time was the right one
[10:06:45] <Wilto> We _might_ be able to force zoom back out on blue, but I didn’t have much luck on my first pass.
[10:06:49] <Wilto> I think it’s doable, though.
[10:06:54] <Wilto> s/blue/blur
[10:07:52] <kinblas> Wilto: so was there some other orientation bug he fixed? Just curious, I was talking to brian leroux yesterday about the default orientation fix I landed last week and he asked about scott's orientation fixes ... was curious about what that was
[10:08:10] <Wilto> Yeah, this thing here: http://filamentgroup.com/lab/a_fix_for_the_ios_orientationchange_zoom_bug/
[10:08:26] <Wilto> The thing where switching orientations will drop you at a weird zoom level if user zoom is enabled.
[10:10:13] <kinblas> al ok
[10:10:16] <kinblas> ah ok
[10:10:29] <kinblas> i think you guys were talking about these 2 different things on twitter that day
[10:10:31] <kinblas> had me confused
[10:10:51] <Wilto> Ah, yeah, that was the same day now that you mention it.
[10:11:01] <Wilto> Well. Different days for Scott.
[10:12:57] <kinblas> johnbender: btw, that test case I referred to is probably in some issue that is closed already, I couldn't find it on my local disk so far
[10:13:05] <johnbender> hrm
[10:13:35] <johnbender> yah the only thing that makes me nervous about this change is that if, for some reason the hashchange doesn't get fired it just borks
[10:13:45] <johnbender> there's no safety net
[10:14:07] <johnbender> though the safety net causes it's own problems, it's the devil we know
[10:15:06] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm thinking this should just go on master since it doesn't appear to be causing problems in the wild
[10:15:11] <johnbender> that should give us some time to sort out issues

[10:24:11] <Wilto> What.
[10:25:16] <Wilto> Oh, “still” broken.
[10:26:11] <johnbender> Wilto: my changes should help
[10:27:16] <Wilto> Is this on me?
[10:27:30] <Wilto> My change was about as simple as they get, but I was mucking around in gitville prior.
[10:39:03] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: kinblas: gseguin: just sent out another PSA on basecamp about the issue I fixed in nav
[10:39:30] <kinblas> johnbender: thanks, saw it
[10:40:09] <johnbender> kinblas: you can just ignore it :D
[10:40:49] <Wilto> Cool.
[10:41:06] <gseguin> johnbender: PSA ?
[10:41:15] <johnbender> gseguin: public service announcement
[10:41:21] <gseguin> oh ok
[10:41:30] <toddmparker_> i'll keep an eye out
[10:44:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: thanks, that was the purpose, I'm not sure the extra information is very helpful :/
[10:44:36] <johnbender> hence the tl;dr
[10:45:02] <toddmparker_> all that stuff is fuzzy to me, so hearing ti again is good
[10:46:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's still fuzzy to me and I've been working on it for 2 days :/
[10:46:22] <johnbender> this cross fit thing is bad news for my brain
[10:46:23] <toddmparker_> exactly

[11:30:30] <gseguin> 'sup?
[11:30:58] <Wilto> We can nuke css/structure/index.php on account of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b32facdd1dbb0a2635ac0d54182e5a6cd5b96f5a , yeah?
[11:30:58] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (1m, 1w ago): Use @imports instead of the PHP combine, r.js will take care of optimization
[11:31:32] <Wilto> Just realized that the docs hadn’t been updated to match, leading to some weird import order shenanigans.
[11:31:53] <gseguin> hmm
[11:31:55] <Wilto> But if that’s extraneous now, we should probably scrap it to avoid any confusion.
[11:32:04] <gseguin> maybe not nuke it
[11:32:16] <gseguin> make it return the file that has the @import
[11:32:24] <gseguin> what do you think?
[11:32:35] <gseguin> for the time being
[11:32:36] <Wilto> We’d be getting two instances of each in that case, yeah?
[11:33:13] <Wilto> Since theme would include all the structure stuff, and the css/index.php would include the theme which would include all the structure stuff.
[11:33:20] <gseguin> no that index.php would be for people who are still pointing at css/structure/
[11:33:31] <Wilto> ( http://wil.to/_/inception.png )
[11:33:31] <gseguin> oh wait
[11:33:44] <Wilto> Yeah, ’cause theme is gonna cover them now either way.
[11:33:54] <Wilto> Else if they have both in there, they get duplicate stylesheets.
[11:34:26] <gseguin> that's right the way to include the css has changed
[11:34:33] * gseguin looks

[11:35:04] <Wilto> I ask because someone called out https://github.com/jakeboone02/jquery-mobile/commit/0e7a54f8a6b758d9906398b90050ca040119e7e5
[11:35:04] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by jakeboone02 (1h, 19m ago): Change order of css files in docs
[11:35:09] <gseguin> but what are the docs pointing at?
[11:36:13] <gseguin> yeah we should get rid of the php, let me switch context ( sorry kinda slow today )
[11:36:46] <Wilto> No worries, man.
[11:37:35] <gseguin> so looking at the docs some are still using the php
[11:37:42] <gseguin> let me remedy that
[11:38:32] <Wilto> I’m just thinking that we should have the index.php do nothing for the sake of everyone who upgrades without editing that link, y’know?
[11:38:44] <Wilto> No 404s, but no doubled-up CSS.
[11:39:07] <gseguin> or if you want to be backward compatible for a bit
[11:39:29] <gseguin> we can remove the require_once('../../structure/index.php'); from the theme php
[11:39:43] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, that works.
[11:39:57] <Wilto> Whatever makes it the most seamless possible transition.
[11:40:11] <gseguin> but we still need to update the docs to point at the css the right way
[11:40:20] <gseguin> I'll take care of that
[11:40:56] * gseguin fires up 'search and replace'
[11:44:56] <johnbender> gseguin: BOOOOO ---> sed
[11:45:18] <johnbender> Wilto: nice, glad we got that sorted
[11:45:26] <johnbender> only took me two days BUT it was a bug
[11:45:30] <johnbender> not test issues
[11:45:41] <johnbender> Wilto: the test suite that is
[11:45:42] <gseguin> johnbender: sed is great when I'm threatened by a guy with a firearm

[11:46:04] <johnbender> thats why I love it

[12:24:19] <Wilto> Ah, hell/
[12:29:15] <Wilto> why are there css inheritance issues all of a sudden
[12:30:29] <johnbender> Wilto: that's the test that fails on and off
[12:30:35] <johnbender> I'm going to go play with that one in a bit
[12:30:54] <Wilto> Ah, gotcha. Yeah, I figured that was unrelated to gseguin’s commit.
[12:31:06] <Wilto> I’m stressing over some different shenanigans.
[12:42:32] <Wilto> I know what the problem is.
[12:42:52] <Wilto> gseguin, by moving to @import we’re forced to pull in all the structure stuff before the theme.
[12:43:21] <Wilto> Which is backwards, since we’re overriding (admittedly very few) things in the theme CSS, in structure.
[12:43:43] <Wilto> Such as the bottom/top borders on buttons within listviews, which are appearing doubled up. Shout-out to that mystery bug earlier.
[12:44:55] <Wilto> I never use @import—I completely forgot that @import rules have to be the first thing in a CSS file.
[12:47:06] <Wilto> So. We could do, like… A CSS file that completely stands in for the index.php, which _also_ imports the theme file.
[12:47:11] <Wilto> If that’s alright by everyone.
[12:47:37] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm not knowledgable enough to comment
[12:47:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[12:47:50] <Wilto> Lemme throw a pen at him.
[12:49:02] <Wilto> Also: what do we name a file that imports all the structure as well as the theme?
[12:49:09] <toddmparker_> that makes sense to me. so it's just a container css with imports to theme, then all structure
[12:49:15] <Wilto> I mean, there’s no downside to this, really. I just wanted to loop everyone in.
[12:49:18] <Wilto> toddmparker_: Yessir.
[12:49:23] <toddmparker_> +1
[12:49:47] <toddmparker_> all-styles.css
[12:49:50] <toddmparker_> heh
[12:49:56] <toddmparker_> uber styles
[12:50:11] <toddmparker_> mega style pack, with very fortunate bonus
[12:50:19] <Wilto> “Freaky Styley”
[12:51:11] <Wilto> DAMMIT TODD
[12:51:30] <Wilto> Maybe it should still be jquery.mobile.theme.css.
[12:52:10] <Wilto> And then the theme file should be renamed. Uh, to the theme, I guess. “jquery.mobile.theme.a.css”,  “jquery.mobile.theme.default.css”
[12:52:19] <johnbender> kinblas: Wilto: gseguin: to get that test to fail in firefox I've resorted to adding the following
[12:52:22] <johnbender> https://gist.github.com/8d5df28f19d3eeed547f
[12:52:28] * johnbender dies a little inside
[12:57:34] <Wilto> What madness is this.
[12:57:47] <johnbender> just reruns the test until it fails :/
[12:59:27] * gseguin is catching up
[13:01:10] <gseguin> oh crap, looks I screwed it up
[13:01:14] <gseguin> sorry guys
[13:02:29] <gseguin> yeah so I guess Wilto's solution to have a css importing the other css in the right order would work
[13:03:51] <gseguin> Wilto: are you on it?
[13:04:01] <Wilto> Yessir.
[13:04:08] <gseguin> k
[13:04:13] <Wilto> Any votes on file naming, anyone? Else I’ll just wing it.
[13:06:05] <gseguin> how about jquery.mobile.css being the index file
[13:06:42] <gseguin> and jquery.mobile.theme.css being the actual theme
[13:06:49] <gseguin> Wilto: ^
[13:07:30] <Wilto> Oh, nice.

[13:48:01] <johnbender> kinblas: the bug in the navigation/base-tests.html appears to be caused by the delay between the triggered "pagechange" and the subsequent hashchange that tells the pushstate plugin to replacestate :(
[13:48:39] <johnbender> since we fire the next test on pagechange there's a chance it will run before the hashchange handler in there is triggered

[15:24:22] <johnbender> gseguin: the first test failure can be ignored, but the second should addressed
[15:24:55] <eddiemonge> can combine.php go away too?
[15:25:14] <gseguin> I think so, don't think it's used anywhere else
[15:25:29] <eddiemonge> if the index.php's go away then combine can too
[15:26:05] <gseguin> we still have the index.php in the theme dirs for the transition phase
[15:27:00] <gseguin> It would be good to add a file that generates a CSS warning or error to notify user that this file will go away
[15:27:17] <gseguin> although this is just a dev file so not sure it's worth the effort
[15:27:32] <gseguin> johnbender: are you looking at the test?
[15:27:44] <eddiemonge> yeah people shouldnt actually be using it and its not documented anywhere to use it
[15:27:45] <johnbender> gseguin: the first one has something to do with firefox
[15:28:00] <johnbender> I'd like to leave the index.php file in /js in there for a while at least
[15:28:08] <gseguin> I have to take care of a bug at Jive
[15:28:12] <johnbender> because right now there might be bugs that are related to load order
[15:28:26] <johnbender> that can easily be checked if we leave the option there to use index.php
[15:30:52] <johnbender> ugh, now I simply can't get this bug to reproduce
[16:07:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: what's the title you guys use for your jquery mobile intro talk
[16:07:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to submit to oscon
[16:15:04] <johnbender> eddiemonge: do you have your recording of my talk at jqcon from Boston?
[16:15:22] <johnbender> I'm hoping I can get my hands on a video of my QCon talk but I don't want to hold my breath
[16:15:30] <johnbender> and I need something by thursday to submit for OSCON
[16:16:28] <johnbender> eddiemonge: if you do, it would be a great help
[16:17:23] <eddiemonge> i dont think i have it anymore. it wasnt very good anyway
[16:17:30] <johnbender> durn
[16:17:31] <eddiemonge> the quality, not the talk.
[16:17:37] <johnbender> eddiemonge: hah, most likely both
[16:17:44] <eddiemonge> i think i got the first part and the last part and the middle got cut out
[16:17:50] <johnbender> not exactly mind bendingly awesome material
[16:18:33] <eddiemonge> what did you want it for? to review your preso style?
[16:19:18] <johnbender> eddiemonge: that, and my submission for OSCON will be helped if I have a video to accompany it
[16:19:42] <johnbender> the folks at qcon spend a ton of money to record all the sessions, and we got good reviews so I'm hoping I can get my hands on that
[16:22:15] <eddiemonge> no vimeo links?
[16:22:23] <johnbender> eddiemonge: not so far as I know
[16:22:34] <johnbender> it's not up on infoq, but it could be elsewhere
[16:22:37] <johnbender> I suppose
[16:23:36] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah it's not supposed to come out until the 19th of march :(
[16:23:39] <johnbender> http://qconsf.com/sf2011/video/
[16:25:32] <eddiemonge> that sucks. tweet them and tell them to hurry up
[16:27:01] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I emailed one of the conf organizers who I got friendly with, something tells me they won't be keen on letting that out early :(
[16:31:05] <eddiemonge> i dont understand why not. its not like they are charging for it
[16:32:35] * johnbender crosses his fingers
[16:32:36] <johnbender> we'll see
[16:35:23] <eddiemonge> want to give a talk in about 3 weeks?
[17:13:31] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I guess it's not out of the question (my wife likes advanced notice). Why?
[17:13:49] <eddiemonge> why not?
[17:14:11] <eddiemonge> i run a monthly jquery meeting on the last tuesday of the month and i dont have a topic yet this month
[17:14:21] <eddiemonge> plus a change in presenters might be nice
[17:15:05] <johnbender> eddiemonge: If nothing else I'm going to be in the bay area at the end of March to do a spring user group meeting and hang out with my adobe buddies
[17:15:08] <johnbender> maybe I could do it then
[17:15:56] <eddiemonge> thatd work too
[17:16:17] <johnbender> eddiemonge: alright, I'll get back to you once I have everything locked down
[17:16:38] <johnbender> eddiemonge: it could be that guy will want to do it on Tuesday in which case I'll have to try and do it sooner, but I'll let you know
[17:21:01] <eddiemonge> ok
[19:15:30] <mikesherov> Hey, can I ask you guys a question?
[19:16:07] <mikesherov> Why is the iOS <4 still supported and tested? Last I heard, it's less than 1% of all iOS versions
[19:16:26] <mikesherov> which makes it about .1% of the entire mobile market
[19:17:57] <mikesherov> food for thought: http://www.marco.org/2011/08/13/instapaper-ios-device-and-version-stats-update
[19:18:06] <mikesherov> http://www.quora.com/What-proportion-of-all-iPhone-owners-use-iOS4-%2a-today
[19:25:24] <eddiemonge> those may not be accurate numbers for all users
[19:25:40] <eddiemonge> and 1% of 100 million users is still 1 million users
[19:27:05] <eddiemonge> sorry over 200 million
[19:27:39] <eddiemonge> for 1% installed, which im guessing is more accurate than 0.1%
[19:27:47] <eddiemonge> and 1% may be on the low side
[19:30:20] <mikesherov> Hm
[19:30:51] <mikesherov> So, at what point do you stop supporting a browser?
[19:31:01] <mikesherov> I would think less than 1% would be reasonable, no?
[19:31:55] <mikesherov> And where do you go for "official" numbers? How do you know when to stop supporting a browser?
[19:33:00] <mikesherov> At some point, you gotta cut of iOS3.X because it requires an unnecessary set of tests to run and fix
[19:34:07] <mikesherov> for example, there is a jQuery Core ticket to simplify offset which would drastically simplify the code base and remove 4 support tests, that *MAY* not be possible to cut if jQuery core has to support original iPhone
[19:34:46] <mikesherov> iOS4 definitely has the support
[19:34:57] <mikesherov> not really sure about iOS3.X
[19:35:19] <mikesherov> but at some point, you gotta drop support for the <1%
[19:50:54] <eddiemonge> at what point do you cut out IE6?
[19:51:44] <eddiemonge> when 1% ceases to be 2 million devices then it may be acceptable but for now keeping it in isnt hurting that much
[19:52:26] <mikesherov> well, that depends
[19:53:34] <mikesherov> IE6 is 7.7% of the internet
[19:53:48] <mikesherov> according to http://www.ie6countdown.com/
[19:54:03] <mikesherov> of course, that's if you believe MSFT's official numbers
[19:54:57] <mikesherov> but even by conservative estimates, it's at least 1.5% of the market
[19:55:17] <mikesherov> which is around 3X the market of iOS3.X
[19:55:50] <mikesherov> and the attrition rate for IE6 is very slow, slower I'd guess than iOS3.X
[19:57:04] <mikesherov> and there are specific bugs in iOS3.X that I can't test against, because I don't have an original iPhone
[19:57:26] <mikesherov> at least with IE6, there are plenty of resources to test changes in: browserstack.com, testling.com
[19:59:34] <eddiemonge> mikesherov: do you test against every mobile device as well?
[20:00:03] <mikesherov> No
[20:00:31] <eddiemonge> ok then
[20:00:35] <eddiemonge> there is your answer
[20:00:47] <mikesherov>  but iOS is at least one browser variant that we can take off the list of browsers we pretend to test in ;-)
[20:01:47] <mikesherov> OK, I'm just saying, there are a few tickets coming up in jQuery 1.8 remove old support tests for browsers jQuery no longer supports
[20:01:57] <mikesherov> safari3 and safari4 explicitly
[20:02:10] <mikesherov> and they may break iOS3.X
[20:02:22] <eddiemonge> i would say drop safari altogether. isnt that less than 1%?
[20:02:29] <eddiemonge> less than ie6 anyway
[20:02:32] <mikesherov> and it'd be a shame to have to be held back by that
[20:02:35] <eddiemonge> not counting mobile safari
[20:02:52] <mikesherov> safari is less than IE6?
[20:02:55] <mikesherov> that's crazy talk
[20:03:25] <mikesherov> safari 5.1 is 3.3% in developed world
[20:03:33] <mikesherov> ie6 is 1.5% in developed world
[20:04:04] <mikesherov> plus safari 5.1 is based on webkit.. it's way easier to support because it's basically the same as chrome
[20:04:29] <mikesherov> it's just that chrome is a bit faster at getting the changes out
[20:04:37] <eddiemonge> basically but not. safari has some weird bugs
[20:04:56] <mikesherov> sure
[20:05:42] <mikesherov> look, the facts remain that IE6 and Safari 5 dwarf iOS3.X
[20:06:06] <mikesherov> and there is a couple of specific support tests that are targetted for removal in jQuery 1.8
[20:06:27] <mikesherov> and it would be a shame if those had to remain in place because of iOS3.X
[20:06:39] <mikesherov> support tests have to run in every browser, on every pageload
[20:07:24] <mikesherov> slowing down page rendering time for everyone to support an what is most likely an insignificant slice of the web
[20:09:40] <eddiemonge> im confused. why would that effect jqm when there are different tests that are run? which code is getting dropped from core for it?
[20:12:04] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/650#issuecomment-3441141
[20:12:06] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by Orkel (1w, 2d ago): Fixes #11123
[20:12:13] <mikesherov> and then there is this other one:
[20:12:52] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/642
[20:12:53] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (2w, 3d ago): fixes #10996 (simplify offset)
[20:15:01] <mikesherov> in that second one, I could remove the proprietary webkitConvertPointFromNodeToPage if I knew that the jqm supported versions of iOS all had getBoundingClientRect
[20:15:06] <mikesherov> but I don't really know
[20:16:01] <mikesherov> notice the github discussions for both these tickets are stuck in "yes, but does it work in mobile's supported browsers?"
[20:16:26] <mikesherov> and then I look at the gbs page for mobile, and it tells me I need to support iOS3
[20:16:31] <eddiemonge> core doesnt officially support mobile browsers though
[20:17:06] <mikesherov> au contraire
[20:17:19] <mikesherov> that's the reason I'm here
[20:17:44] <mikesherov> I'm here to make sure that jQuery core will still play nive after these changes
[20:18:04] <mikesherov> and I'd like to not have to nix these changes just because of iOS3.X
[20:18:31] <mikesherov> it may be a moot point, but having to test in iOS3.X IS a major bottleneck for me
[20:18:52] <mikesherov> but hey, if you guys say it needs to be supported, I guess it needs to be supported :-)
[20:20:24] <eddiemonge> is it just the testing part to make sure it works on that device?
[20:22:21] <mikesherov> yeah
[20:22:41] <mikesherov> I have no way to test, and it's insignificant portion of the market (IMHO)
[20:23:02] <mikesherov> Again, what I consider to be insignificant may deviate from the jqm team's opinion
[20:23:18] <eddiemonge> i say drop it from core and jqm can keep it since its a different audience
[20:23:47] <eddiemonge> or have Wilto do a test on all the mobile devices filament has for every commit to every project.
[20:24:53] <mikesherov> hmm
[20:25:00] <mikesherov> it's an interesting problem
[20:25:10] <mikesherov> I'm not really sure how to solve this.
[20:25:27] <mikesherov> Basically, I don't want to cut something from core if it breaks mobile...
[20:25:52] <mikesherov> are you saying you'd add the support tests back in yourselves for mobile if it was needed?
[20:27:01] <mikesherov> but that it's outside the purview of core?
[20:31:33] <eddiemonge> sure
[20:31:42] <eddiemonge> but id ask toddmparker_
[20:31:54] <eddiemonge> it can be brought up on thursday
[20:32:03] <mikesherov> Thursday is your meeting?
