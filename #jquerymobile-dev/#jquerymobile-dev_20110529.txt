[12:28:48] <StevenBlack> ?tell kinblas: Here's a compendium of issues we would need to resolve in order to breakout success and error callbacks from the mainline $.ajax() call.  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Refactor:-Ajax-callback-breakout
[12:28:49] <bot-t> StevenBlack, Okay.
[12:41:06] <gseguin> _nickel: How would you go about handling options and globals and keeping your post body param-less?
[12:41:10] <gseguin> querystring?
[12:41:27] <_nickel> gseguin: yap
[12:41:39] <_nickel> gseguin: I haven't thought it through though
[12:41:57] * _nickel marvels at that sentence
[12:42:30] <gseguin> :)
[12:42:33] <_nickel> also I'm not sure how complex the param parsing library is for express since you'll need array arguments
[12:43:01] <_nickel> foo=1,2,3 => { 'foo' : [ '1', '2', '3'] }
[12:43:04] <_nickel> and such
[12:44:25] <gseguin> wait which arguments take array
[12:44:26] <gseguin> ?
[12:47:35] <gseguin> _nickel: can you think of one?
[12:50:49] <StevenBlack> gseguin: has your nested listview solution been merged to Master yet?
[12:51:06] <gseguin> let me check
[12:51:35] <gseguin> StevenBlack: nope
[12:51:44] <StevenBlack> Shoot.
[12:51:52] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1701
[12:52:08] <StevenBlack> Let me explain: I have a related issue with data-cache="false" for pages.
[12:52:59] <StevenBlack> We can't removePage() any member of a nested list "family" until we truly exit that cluster of pages.
[12:53:50] <StevenBlack> I was hoping there would be something I can use to tell whether we're in a nested listview and, if so, somehow be able to collect all its member pages for removal.
[12:54:33] * gseguin thinking
[12:55:18] <gseguin> can you gather the family form the generated ids?
[12:55:34] * StevenBlack is looking at the commit code now.
[13:02:34] <gseguin> StevenBlack: I've got to go, I'll check in later
[13:02:40] * StevenBlack wonders: is there a way to view a branch in website mode directly from github.com
[13:02:55] <StevenBlack> It's cool ghislain, I think I've got what I need for now.
[13:03:17] <gseguin> alright, DM me if you need anything
[13:03:24] <StevenBlack> k
