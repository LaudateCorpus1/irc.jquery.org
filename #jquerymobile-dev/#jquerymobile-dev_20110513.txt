[07:33:21] <toddparker> stevenblack - i tagged #1620 as a blocker and assigned to kinblas
[07:33:49] <StevenBlack> Thanks!
[07:33:59] <toddparker> i've been assigning all new ajax nav/url issues to kinblas so he can track 'em
[07:52:52] <StevenBlack> toddparker: 1617's a blocker too.  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1617
[08:40:17] <toddparker> I assigned 1617 as a critical for now
[08:40:42] <toddparker> maybe gseguin_ would want to look at that too: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1617
[08:41:05] <toddparker> it just needs a more unique identifier
[08:41:15] <gseguin_> sure, I'll put that in my queue
[08:41:20] <toddparker> cool
[09:43:28] <gseguin_> ?m1419
[09:44:21] <gseguin_> how come the bot didn't pick that up?
[09:53:59] <toddparker> I dunno
[10:12:31] <StevenBlack> bot-t works when the bot is in the channel, listed as a participant....
[10:38:26] <gseguin_> StevenBlack: How do I invite bot-t?
[10:42:11] <toddparker> anyone running firefox mobile? selects don't work: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1626
[10:43:03] <toddparker> i was scared when i first saw this b/c i thought it was a bug in the native browser for android
[10:43:08] <toddparker> not sure who uses ff
[11:30:14] <StevenBlack> gseguin: user temp01 is the keeper of bot-t.  Its server must need a reset.  temp01 is normally around, not today though.
[11:38:51] <toddparker> hey _nickel
[11:39:23] <_nickel> toddparker: hallo!
[11:39:25] <toddparker> gseguin_ - did you see my comment...submit a pull and i'll merge that redio change in. works perfectly everywhere
[11:39:32] <toddparker> what's up bender!
[11:39:41] <toddparker> can't believe it's already friday
[11:39:49] <toddparker> sounds like your presentation went well
[11:46:32] <_nickel> toddparker: the presentation went spectacularly well
[11:46:37] <_nickel> people like my jokes
[11:46:41] <_nickel> :D
[11:46:46] <_nickel> and I gave you guys a huge shout out obviously for the slides and the project
[11:46:50] <_nickel> la rubyists now know you as "the geniuses behind jqm" :D
[11:51:50] <kinblas_> _nickel: let's hear one of your jokes :-)
[12:03:06] <toddparker> heh
[12:03:24] <toddparker> yeah...so this rubyist walks into a bar...
[12:03:46] <toddparker> kinblas_ - why can't i see you?
[12:03:51] <toddparker> are you hiding?
[12:23:00] <gseguin_> toddparker: Sorry I was in a meeting
[12:23:11] <gseguin_> Will do, right after lunch
[12:57:44] <toddparker> gseguin_ - sweet, just pull this into master. thanks!
[12:58:12] <gseguin_> I just did but I may have messed up
[12:58:41] <gseguin_> I'm used to mercurial,  new to git
[12:59:24] <gseguin_> let me know if I need to redo it, I've read the manual now :)
[13:42:20] <StevenBlack> ?tell eddiemonge Hi Eddie, can we put a 'make: <dateTime>' comment in the js and min.js files created by the make process?  As releases get progressively staler, we need to tell if a bug report is referencing the products of a recent make.  Sensible?
[13:42:21] <bot-t> StevenBlack, Okay.
[14:02:30] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm here, trying to catch up after 3.5 days of not attending to stuff :-)
[14:56:31] <toddparker> looking for some help fixing the blog template for mobile: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/
[14:56:40] <toddparker> older posts link at the top is a mess
[14:56:54] <toddparker> i'd like to start turning on comments for a week but can't seem to get 'em on
[14:57:06] <toddparker> eddie?
[15:12:37] <eddiemonge> toddparker: i updated the blog post from today to fix the code to copy into a project
[15:12:37] <bot-t> (1 hour 30 mins ago) <StevenBlack> tell eddiemonge Hi Eddie, can we put a 'make: <dateTime>' comment in the js and min.js files created by the make process? As releases get progressively staler, we need to tell if a bug report is referencing the products of a recent make. Sensible?
[15:13:22] <eddiemonge> StevenBlack: yt?
[15:18:51] <eddiemonge> anyone around that can pull in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1629 ?
[15:21:57] <toddparker> done
[15:22:11] <toddparker> thanks eddiemonge
[15:37:36] <StevenBlack> eddiemonge: hi!
[15:37:53] <eddiemonge> im not sure what your question was
[15:38:52] <StevenBlack> Users submit failure cases and we can't really tell if the js file is from the A4.1 release (weeks ago) or a recent make the user may have built locally.
[15:39:33] <StevenBlack> If the user pulls latest, and makes, the file name is still ~~~A4.1.min.js
[15:41:03] <StevenBlack> Hoping to avoid re-iving this long conversation: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1620
[15:42:40] <StevenBlack> The nightlies are timestamped.  Hoping the `make` products can be timestamped too.
[15:45:12] <eddiemonge> it can be overriden using this syntax: make VER="MYCUSTOMVERSION"
[15:50:02] <_nickel> kinblas: toddparker: beware the checked expando!
[15:50:17] <_nickel> I'm terrible at communicating in emails
[15:51:01] <kinblas> _nickel: eh? I got what you said :-)
[15:51:14] <_nickel> good to know
[15:51:23] <kinblas> _nickel: is it basically what that 1.6.1 blog post talked about?
[15:51:41] <_nickel> I'm not sure
[15:51:44] <kinblas> attrs don't update, but expandos do?
[15:52:08] <_nickel> I have to believe on some level that it is since the person who logged https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1532
[15:52:14] <_nickel> noted that it works with 1.5.*
[15:52:20] <_nickel> BUT
[15:52:40] <_nickel> if you pull a checked radio
[15:52:51] <_nickel> and get at the dom object
[15:52:58] <_nickel> sometimes .checked reports the wrong value
[15:53:45] <toddparker> fun
[15:53:55] <_nickel> kinblas: toddparker: http://i.imgur.com/ri4vN.png
[15:53:59] <_nickel> thats what I was asking about
[15:54:05] <_nickel> maybe I'm taking crazy pills?
[15:54:24] <toddparker> ah, right
[15:54:34] <toddparker> http://ejohn.org/blog/jquery-16-and-attr/
[15:54:37] <_nickel> at first glance it looks like attr is reporting wrong
[15:54:44] <_nickel> but then look at the output to console
[15:54:49] <toddparker> did you guys read that post?
[15:54:51] <_nickel> checked clearly is in fact "checked"
[15:54:52] <_nickel> I did
[15:54:59] <_nickel> not thoroughly though
[15:55:02] <_nickel> and I tried using .prop
[15:56:09] <scottjehl> hi
[15:56:53] <_nickel> toddparker: kinblas: the only issue is that I think :checked uses .checked
[15:57:02] <_nickel> or it did from what I could tell
[15:57:13] <_nickel> which in the case of the linked screen means it would report false
[15:57:19] <_nickel> when in fact it was checked=checked
[15:57:23] <toddparker> scottjehl is gonna check in from EUROPE
[15:57:35] <_nickel> awesome
[15:57:36] <scottjehl> yep present
[15:57:39] <_nickel> hhaha
[15:57:49] <toddparker> i gotta jey boys
[15:57:52] <toddparker> jet
[15:57:55] <toddparker> see ya!
[15:58:02] <scottjehl> have a great weekend!
[15:59:43] <eddiemonge> _nickel: what did .prop('checked') report?
[16:03:15] <eddiemonge> StevenBlack: ok change made. However, as an un-intended but hopefully helpful side effect, all make commands will output the git info used to make that build, except for make deploy. that will pull the version.txt and use that
[16:04:14] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1630
[16:09:12] <kinblas> Yo scott how'd the talk go?
[16:11:00] <StevenBlack> eddiemonge I think that's *very* helpful.  Now we can eyeball the js in a user-hosted failure case and directly infer its freshness.
[16:12:25] <scottjehl> did you guys need me on any question? Bender / Kin / Stephen?
[16:12:44] <scottjehl> Todd mentioned something was being discussed
[16:12:50] <scottjehl> .. ? :)
[16:13:05] <eddiemonge> scottjehl: i could use a pull merge
[16:13:34] <StevenBlack> scottjehl:  Issue 1709 maybe?
[16:13:38] <StevenBlack> ?m1709
[16:13:40] <bot-t> StevenBlack, Couldn't find "m1709" in jQuery Docs.
[16:13:52] <StevenBlack> ?m1079
[16:13:53] <bot-t> [#1079] Virtual keyboard hides text input (tested on Iphone and Android) (open, 5 - Critical) - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1079
[16:14:42] <kinblas> eddiemonge: you talking about this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1630/files
[16:14:43] <scottjehl> ah
[16:14:54] <eddiemonge> yup
[16:15:30] <kinblas> I'll land it for ya
[16:15:53] <eddiemonge> StevenBlack: would adding 50% padding to the bottom of the element on focus and scroll down that much then remove the padding on blur fix that?
[16:16:22] <eddiemonge> thanks kinblas. kinda excited/nervous about tuesday btw. 3.5 hours is a long time
[16:16:32] <kinblas> lol
[16:16:39] <kinblas> don't be ... we're chill
[16:16:42] <scottjehl> what's tues?
[16:17:42] <StevenBlack> scottjehl, eddiemonge: I'm interested in what solution eventually transpires for 1079.  There's no onKeyboardSlide event, I presume :-)
[16:19:36] <eddiemonge> StevenBlack: thats why i said focus and hopefully it comes before keyboard slide but im not sure. ive never tested that
[16:19:55] <eddiemonge> scottjehl: hopefully the first day of the best time of my life
[16:20:09] <StevenBlack> eddiemonge: you know, that idea just might work.
[16:20:47] <eddiemonge> StevenBlack: only if it works like i think it would. i could code it up this weekend, if i have time, but i probably wont
[16:21:01] <eddiemonge> i need to stop starting so many projects at once sheesh
[16:21:21] <StevenBlack> Other option would be a scrollTo the vertical offset of the text input.
[16:22:04] <scottjehl> eddiemonge: awesome man, g'luck
[16:22:56] <eddiemonge> StevenBlack: isnt that the problem though, there is no vertical offset for it to scroll to? or not enough at least
[16:23:26] <StevenBlack> Yes, good point.
[16:24:58] <eddiemonge> i need to go buy an android phone again. its been about 4 days and im having withdrawal symptoms
[17:14:22] <StevenBlack> ?tell eddiemonge: just tested a `make` and the timestamp comment works perfectly.
[17:14:23] <bot-t> StevenBlack, Okay.
[17:38:30] <StevenBlack> THIS looks interesting.  pathjs.  https://github.com/mtrpcic/pathjs   Thinking this might be insightful for our nav refactor relating to urls and paths.
[17:39:34] <StevenBlack> Note the .enter() and .exit() methods on routes.
