[07:07:29] <giesse> hello. i have a Galaxy Nexus and am experiencing the "blinking transitions" problems.
[07:07:40] <giesse> please let me know if i can help by testing stuff.
[07:08:17] <giesse> (i also tried Firefox and Opera on said device, they don't blink but there is no animation. i assume that is expected.)

[11:19:19] <toddmparker_> how's everyone doing?
[11:19:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I have some mild indigestion
[11:21:28] <toddmparker_> from code or a burrito?
[11:21:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I might just be hungry
[11:21:53] <johnbender> sometimes it's hard to tell
[11:21:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I responded to _|Nix|_ 's pr
[11:22:36] <johnbender> everyone is welcome to disagree with my silly opinions
[11:22:46] * johnbender is raising the roof for discussion
[11:23:20] <toddmparker_> cool, haven't had a chance to read up
[11:25:44] <toddmparker_> err...I didn't see an email

[11:25:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3504#issuecomment-3744807
[11:25:58] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (1d, 10h ago): Disable
[11:26:28] <toddmparker_> johnbender: can you take a quick look at this? the guy is building the hbogo app so it's high profile - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3456#issuecomment-3744154
[11:26:36] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3456 on jquery-mobile, reported by reduxdj (1w, 5d ago): Android - fails to create jquery dom elements
[11:26:37] <johnbender> hbogo app?
[11:27:47] <gseguin> http://www.hbogo.com/ ?
[11:32:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm glad he reported the issue but the "we have to move away from the framework" sure makes it hard to be motivated
[11:32:51] <toddmparker_> yeah, reactive
[11:33:32] <toddmparker_> glad i didn't respond in kind, seems high profile so it's worth helping out a bit if it's easy
[11:34:24] <toddmparker_> hbogo.com/activate
[11:35:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: rendered for me on my 2.3
[11:36:24] <toddmparker_> it does, but it has all kinds of janky stuff going on for each provider - think even iframes
[11:37:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: :/
[11:38:24] <toddmparker_> just answer real q's, don't try to debug his app for him
[11:38:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kk, heading to lunch
[13:39:21] <toddmparker_> i miss anything fun?
[13:40:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I have snarky answers for everthing today but I'm cutting myself off
[13:40:55] <johnbender> it's the Wilto vacuum
[13:43:02] <toddmparker_> yeah, he fills and important role around here
[13:43:13] <toddmparker_> snark and sarcasm and gifs
[13:43:22] <toddmparker_> oh, and some coding I guess :)
[13:44:43] <toddmparker_> think that PR reasoning makes sense.
[13:44:53] <toddmparker_> i'd rather stay close to the way the widget factory works
[13:44:54] <imjoshdean> toddmparker_: What are we going to do?
[13:44:55] <imjoshdean> http://wil.to/_/panic.gif
[13:45:09] * imjoshdean is done trying to help fill those shoes.
[13:45:10] <johnbender> imjoshdean: that's a good one
[13:45:48] <toddmparker_> nice imjoshdean, digging into the stash
[13:46:02] <imjoshdean> toddmparker_: Just doing my part. Glad he leaves it so open.
[13:46:27] <toddmparker_> it's a gift to the world
[13:46:53] <imjoshdean> Hm...there's some gems in here.
[13:54:01] <toddmparker_> ahem. http://mobilesyrup.com/2012/01/30/rim-creates-4-cartoon-characters-to-spread-the-be-bold-message/
[13:57:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah, I was hoping we could get some apparel
[14:28:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: can I ask you a quick question
[14:28:32] <toddmparker_> sure
[14:28:46] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm trying to come up with the "Marketing blurb" for responsive design
[14:28:58] <johnbender> I've been talking with my wife about it since her company does a lot of itneractive work for he clients
[14:28:59] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[14:29:02] <johnbender> *her clients
[14:29:12] <johnbender> in my two seconds of thought
[14:29:30] <toddmparker_> a good overview by our pal Ethan Marcotte
[14:29:30] <toddmparker_> http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/
[14:29:33] <johnbender> A technique/movement to design a single website that responds and caters two all device sizes
[14:29:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I've read it
[14:29:45] <johnbender> s/two/too/
[14:29:45] <toddmparker_> oh, ok :)
[14:29:49] <johnbender> s/too/to/
[14:29:55] <toddmparker_> heh
[14:30:02] <toddmparker_> you're typing like me
[14:30:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I just want it to capture the spirit of the thing
[14:30:18] <johnbender> and obviously you're the person to ask
[14:30:22] <toddmparker_> yeah, what you said is good
[14:30:40] <johnbender> nice
[14:30:57] <toddmparker_> using CSS MQ's to adapt a layout to take best advantage of the size and capabilities of a device
[14:31:21] <toddmparker_> so a site "just works"  - no panning or zooming around
[14:31:45] <toddmparker_> it's also tied into the "one web" idea
[14:32:13] <toddmparker_> single codebase, different expierences (each appropriate to the device_
[14:32:41] <toddmparker_> done right, you approach RWD mobile first
[14:32:55] <toddmparker_> start with each element/widget being 100% fluid
[14:33:08] <toddmparker_> so it takes advantage of varying screens
[14:33:40] <toddmparker_> then layer on MQ's to add columns or other layout devices to take better advantage of the space as you go wider
[14:33:56] <toddmparker_> don't start with desktop code and chop it down
[14:34:19] <toddmparker_> does that help?
[14:37:09] <toddmparker_> johnbender: been tagging with [docs], like a good boy
