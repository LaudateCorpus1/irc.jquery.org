[05:01:58] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[05:03:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[05:03:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good morning!
[05:04:03] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz , afternoon _|Nix|_ 
[05:04:17] <_|Nix|_> Nav failure, eh?
[05:04:27] <_|Nix|_> Might be intermittent.
[05:05:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just wanted to say that I looked at your PR for active state & forms
[05:05:08] <uGoMobi> like you asked
[05:05:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Great!
[05:05:34] <uGoMobi> no objections 
[05:05:39] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[05:06:25] <_|Nix|_> I'm making a few changes withn the vclick handler to reduce the usage of jQuery objects and use DOM elements more often instead.
[05:06:48] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[05:07:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the issue with the mini textinput is fixed in iOS6
[05:07:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so I closed it after all
[05:07:37] <uGoMobi> the zoom issue I mean
[05:07:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool yeah not a big deal if fixed in ios6
[05:08:06] <uGoMobi> exactly, not worth spending time on
[05:08:25] <uGoMobi> I just pushed a fix for the other iOS zoom issue with selects
[05:08:35] <arschmitz> nice
[05:08:47] <uGoMobi> so we are done with zoom for now :)
[05:09:16] <arschmitz> GOOD! lol
[05:13:44] <_|Nix|_> js/widgets/forms/button.js:52: if ( !!~$el[0].className.indexOf( "ui-btn-left" ) ) ...
[05:13:48] <_|Nix|_> What does the ~ mean?
[05:14:08] * _|Nix|_ is a JS n00b.
[05:14:41] <_|Nix|_> Woah ... bitwise not?
[05:16:55] <_|Nix|_> OK ... !!~ seems to convert indexOf to boolean.
[05:17:14] <_|Nix|_> Like, !!~$( "<div class='someClass'></div>" )[ 0 ].className.indexOf( "someClass" ) -> true
[05:17:23] <_|Nix|_> and !!~$( "<div class='someClass'></div>" )[ 0 ].className.indexOf( "xxx" ) -> false

[05:45:38] <uGoMobi> I am on it ^^
[06:24:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: I also have a selectmenu failure locally: The preventFocusZoom option is working as expected - zoom is disabled on vmousedown ...
[06:24:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the test that is failing says it isn't enable on mouseup
[06:24:48] <_|Nix|_> I'm running the tests on the merge of button-active-state before pushing.
[06:24:54] <uGoMobi> but in reality it is
[06:25:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then maybe the means by which it is checking it's status is out-of-date.
[06:25:33] <uGoMobi> i ran the zoom test instead of select before pushing :(
[06:25:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP. I guess that means you can also reproduce the select failure?
[06:26:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, I don't get a failure for this one: The preventFocusZoom option is working as expected - zoom is disabled on vmousedown
[06:27:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Uh-oh ...
[06:27:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It sounds like the mechanism by which it checks whether zooming is enabled/disabled is broken.
[06:27:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oops sorry... I do get it
[06:28:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, good, that means you can reproduce it.
[06:28:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i havent had a chance to look at these yet but yeah it sounds like from what you two are saying that its probably the test not the code
[06:29:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm also just looking at what the test is saying and what uGoMobi is saying. I haven't really looked into it, because I'm busy merging the button-active-state branch.
[06:30:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am looking into it
[06:30:50] <_|Nix|_> Man ... jQuery old build 83 had a huge list of changes, and ever since then, every build has been breaking. I wonder how that happened.
[06:31:08] <_|Nix|_> I mean, how did all those changes end up in one build?
[06:32:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i wonder if they stripped the old ie support yet? if so that could be it
[06:33:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Who's "they"?
[06:33:33] <arschmitz> the core team
[06:33:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see ... you think switching to the new core did it?
[06:34:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But we've had successful builds since then.
[06:34:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it was just a guess since you mentioned a ton of failures since that specific build
[06:34:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that that could be the reson for so many changes in a single build
[06:35:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was really speaking more to the # of changes rather then the failures
[06:36:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, that one. Right. I dunno, but it looks like the jQuery Old jumped ahead by a ton of commits.
[06:37:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i see probably check with someone over on the core team they would probably know the reason
[06:38:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono. This has nothing to do with core. Phantom Master Old always runs against the same versions of core, but it's like one day it ran our master as it was a month ago, and the next day it ran our master as it was yesterday.
[06:38:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bam! All of a sudden, tons of changes.
[06:38:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe that was the tables branch merge or something.
[06:39:19] <arschmitz> OH OH OH ok sorry i was terribly confused as to what you were saying

[06:39:51] <arschmitz> i thought you were talking about a ton of changes to core and then failures
[06:40:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono. A ton of changes to our code.
[06:40:09] <arschmitz> :( sorry im not really totaly with it today i guess
[06:40:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/ Ever since build https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/83 it's a string of failures.
[06:41:03] <_|Nix|_> Gah! Auto-replace!
[06:41:17] <_|Nix|_> Ever since build number 83 it's a string of failures :)
[06:41:59] <_|Nix|_> I guess there's no foolproof regex for converting strings of the form #nnn into issue URLs ...
[06:42:26] <_|Nix|_> ... while avoiding the conversion of non-issue-number related expressions into such URLs.
[06:43:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah 83 looks like tables branch merge
[06:43:47] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, it's the merge of the tables branch.
[06:43:52] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[06:44:12] <_|Nix|_> Should advise jlembeck and toddmparker about the ensuing build failure.
[06:44:33] <arschmitz> oh it looks like its also the clear button
[06:44:40] <arschmitz> for text inputs
[06:46:09] <arschmitz> so thats two branches with a lot of changes being merged in the same build !
[06:46:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and unfortunately the console gives no indication as to which tests are timing out.
[06:47:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: fun that should be easy to figure out :|
[06:47:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's actually possible, because the list of unit test URLs is listed at the top.
[06:47:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and they're performed in the same order as listed there.
[06:47:50] <arschmitz> oh well thats not too too bad then
[06:48:31] <arschmitz> im not super super familier with our build process yet but its pretty similar to my own at least
[06:53:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The timeout is happening during the ... wait for it ... unit test for .... drumroll ... table!
[06:53:36] <arschmitz> :)
[06:54:02] <arschmitz> i figured that was more likely then the clear button a lot more going on there
[06:56:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: our jenkins is so crazy compared to mine ha ha so much more going on 
[06:57:11] <uGoMobi> that test is driving me crazy

[07:01:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ or arschmitz : can one of you help me?
[07:01:37] <arschmitz> sure your still looking at the zoom test right?
[07:01:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[07:01:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this is the change https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/1f11c3800867d43a96f3451c58136f115c1cc94b
[07:03:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this is the test that is failing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/unit/select/select_native.js#L69
[07:26:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i found it
[07:26:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: tell me
[07:26:44] <arschmitz> you moved your check for prevent foucs zoom outside the event binding 
[07:26:50] <arschmitz> it has to be inside it
[07:26:51] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:26:53] <arschmitz> as it was before
[07:27:12] <uGoMobi> i just tested it when I put it back inside
[07:27:14] <arschmitz> because it can be change and if you change it those were still never bound
[07:27:27] <uGoMobi> and i got a failure
[07:27:34] <arschmitz> all tests are passing for me
[07:27:42] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[07:27:47] <arschmitz> hold on ill push to my fork so you can see what i did
[07:28:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great, thanks a lot!
[07:30:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/blob/select-test-fix/js/widgets/forms/select.js#L189
[07:31:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, so it's just for the button
[07:31:49] <arschmitz> probably need to do the same for focus click focus and blur
[07:32:01] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[07:32:13] <arschmitz> but those dont have tests so they cant fail
[07:32:22] <uGoMobi> i still have that version here... will check again to see if test don't fail
[07:32:32] <uGoMobi> yeah good point
[07:33:12] <uGoMobi> I thought I could save some code there but turned out not a good idea
[07:33:23] <arschmitz> yeah need to check each time the event is triggered to account for the fact that it can change
[07:34:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it was a good idea though lol!
[07:34:19] <uGoMobi> yeah, once... but never again ;)
[07:34:21] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:34:31] <arschmitz> ha ha :)

[07:39:51] <uGoMobi> thanks a lot for your help arschmitz 
[07:40:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem it was kinda a weird one i found the fix only out of well this is the only real change i can see and then figured out why it mattered after lol
[07:42:41] <uGoMobi> actually I thought the same... so I reverted that while not knowing how that could break it
[07:42:58] <uGoMobi> not sure though why the test was still failing first time I tested
[07:45:17] <arschmitz> did you only move one of the events maybe?
[07:45:38] <arschmitz> ah anyway who knows its fixed lol
[07:48:03] <uGoMobi> I probably made a mistake
[07:48:59] <Mr_Grim> has anyone had issues running jquery mobile within phonegap?
[07:49:57] <uGoMobi> Mr_Grim: "issues" is very generic
[07:50:40] <uGoMobi> Mr_Grim: if you have a specific issue please open a new issue on Github
[07:50:54] <uGoMobi> so we can look into it
[07:51:11] <gseguin> mornin' folks
[07:51:28] <arschmitz> morning gseguin
[07:51:39] <gseguin> what did I miss?
[07:52:10] <uGoMobi> gseguin: morning, had a nice birthday party yesterday?
[07:52:32] <gseguin> yeah, I worked until 12:30am
[07:52:53] <uGoMobi> your kids singing for you at your bed at 6am? ;-)
[07:52:59] <gseguin> and then my kids celebrated my bday at about 2am
[07:53:10] <uGoMobi> ah ok... nice
[07:53:20] <gseguin> I sure that's what all that crying was about at least
[07:53:31] <uGoMobi> :D
[07:54:30] <gseguin> so when are we pushing the patch releases out?
[07:54:58] <uGoMobi> gseguin: good question... let's discuss at today's meeting
[07:55:06] <arschmitz> gseguin: not sure hasnt been much talk about it lately just pushing for 1.3 mostly
[07:55:19] <arschmitz> but id been wondering the same myself
[07:55:44] <gseguin> yeah and we've got 3 running branches
[07:56:12] <gseguin> so for our sake it's time to close one by releasing the last patch release on it
[07:56:13] <arschmitz> and last i checked all three were suposed to be out by begining of the year lol
[07:56:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this reminds me... your fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5291 hasn't been picked into 1.1 or 1.2 stable
[07:56:49] <gseguin> see, exactly what I was sayin' ;)
[07:57:28] <uGoMobi> that was because I had to ask you about that 500 -> 1025px change first
[07:58:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ahh yeah im not sure we could pick that one or just leave it with all the other fixed toolbar issues for 1.3 what do you think?
[07:58:10] <uGoMobi> should we leave it for 1.3 with all other fixed toolbar fixes or want to cherry-pick and just keep the old value
[07:58:15] <arschmitz> lol
[07:58:25] <uGoMobi> I think we think the same
[07:58:27] <uGoMobi> :D
[07:58:32] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[07:58:38] <arschmitz> damn it uGoMobi: _|Nix|_ stay out of my head!!! 
[07:58:50] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:59:10] <uGoMobi> ok I'll add your fix to the 1.3 release notes wiki page
[07:59:32] <arschmitz> yeah i need to add all my stuff to the 1.3 release notes iv been lazy
[07:59:48] <RWhitbeck> bad arschmitz, bad
[07:59:49] <uGoMobi> can't say you have been lazy
[08:00:04] <arschmitz> oh and someone already added the fixed toolbar extension
[08:00:10] <uGoMobi> but yeah, if you haven't added it yet make sure you do
[08:00:18] <uGoMobi> yes I added that arschmitz 
[08:00:32] <arschmitz> need to merge and add the swipe rewrite and the range slider once its ready
[08:00:53] <uGoMobi> you guys do the difficult stuff... I can update a wiki page ;)
[08:01:03] <arschmitz> which reminds me i need to merge the swipe rewrite lol
[08:01:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am going to look into slider CSS now
[08:01:47] <arschmitz> ok yeah we should make sure we are on the same page with that and range 
[08:01:50] <arschmitz> for the css
[08:02:05] <arschmitz> ill push my most recent changes for range if i havent already

[08:46:21] <Mr_Grim> gseguin what is backface-visibility?
[08:48:14] <Mr_Grim> gseguin and how does it relate to crashing webkit?
[08:48:20] <Mr_Grim> also crashes on Android as well

[08:54:55] <gseguin> Mr_Grim: it's a css property
[08:55:10] <gseguin> you can use it to force h/w accel
[08:55:43] <gseguin> but it causes Webkit to crash

[09:06:33] <Wilto> MATH ALERT
[09:06:51] <johnbender> lol
[09:06:56] <johnbender> yessir
[09:07:40] <gseguin> lol
[09:08:40] <arschmitz> DAMN IT johnbender i thought once i got a math degree that excused me from all further math 
[09:08:57] <johnbender> arschmitz: you have a math degree!??!
[09:09:01] <johnbender> zomg
[09:09:07] <johnbender> I will bother you constantly from now on
[09:09:21] <arschmitz> yeah physics and math
[09:09:56] <Wilto> I’m pretty good at coloring books.
[09:10:10] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I stick to CSS, what about you? ;)
[09:10:44] <uGoMobi> even just looking at johnbender his post makes my eyes roling
[09:10:44] <Wilto> YEP.
[09:10:57] <Wilto> I am determined to fight my way through it.
[09:11:18] <Wilto> yes yes I see so if squiggly line and also other different squiggly line okay with you so far
[09:11:29] <johnbender> don't get discouraged it's really quite simple
[09:11:38] <Wilto> So am I.
[09:11:39] <johnbender> and I don't mean that in a "I'm so smart hahahaha"
[09:12:08] <johnbender> it's just the long form of what you would think through if you were building a simple programming language
[09:12:16] <johnbender> How do the bits fit together?
[09:12:21] <johnbender> How do you evaluate them?
[09:12:36] <johnbender> Are there problems with how they evaluate?
[09:12:40] <johnbender> that's all it is
[09:14:28] <Mr_Grim> gseguin so you are saying this backface-visibility should be set to hidden?
[09:14:30] <Wilto> I mostly manage to put commas in the, right places.
[09:15:03] <gseguin> Mr_Grim: nope, just don't use that property
[09:15:03] <arschmitz> johnbender: Thats fine you can bother me just dont expect me to remember stuff ha ha ha 
[09:15:12] <johnbender> arschmitz: :)
[09:15:43] <arschmitz> johnbender: iv read a bunch of your math related posts though good stuff
[09:16:19] <gseguin> Wilto: I'm still working on my semicolons skills, commas are next
[09:16:20] <Wilto> Jeff Lembeck just translated “0-arity lambda” to “anon function with no arguments” for me, and I am gonna use the HELL out of that.
[09:16:44] <johnbender> arschmitz: thanks man!
[09:16:50] <uGoMobi> it is really interesting stuff... I just need to read it couple of time to make it all land
[09:17:04] <uGoMobi> s/time/times/
[09:17:30] <Mr_Grim> so i am going to strip that out of the entire app
[09:17:32] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: arschmitz: the key here is the hook
[09:17:33] <Mr_Grim> the css
[09:17:45] <Wilto> Much like my short-lived rap career, johnbender.
[09:17:48] <johnbender> I contemplated making it a bit more inflamatory just to get people to read it
[09:18:00] <Wilto> “coffee script sucks lol”
[09:18:04] <johnbender> Wilto: I noticed the bot doesn't have an alias for that one
[09:18:14] <johnbender> Wilto: hahah something like that
[09:18:15] <Wilto> ?mlmlm
[09:18:16] <bot-t> much like multi-level marketing
[09:18:19] <johnbender> ...
[09:18:20] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:18:26] <Wilto> ?mlmlmlm
[09:18:27] <bot-t> Wilto, Couldn't find "mlmlmlm" in jQuery Docs.
[09:18:29] <Wilto> Damn.
[09:22:02] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: added to my read it later list. I have a bunch of stuff I'm gonna read over xmass break
[09:24:57] <arschmitz> johnbender: thinking about math is giving me C++ flash backs from college and iv worked really hard to forget C++ NOT COOL MAN!
[09:26:07] <Mr_Grim> gseguin i am going to attempt to crash my app now
[09:35:54] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking to replicate the history skipping behaviour of a dialog, without opening the dialog. Does that makes sense?
[09:36:36] <ryanneufeld> is there a way to skip history on a link, without disabling ajax?
[09:37:39] <RWhitbeck> would using a popup instead of a dialog work for you?
[09:38:09] <RWhitbeck> oh nevermind...
[09:38:17] <RWhitbeck> I am way off ;-)
[09:39:53] <ryanneufeld> RWhitbeck: basically you click a link, it does stuff. and then it redirects back
[09:40:03] <ryanneufeld> and i've just described a form...
[09:40:05] <ryanneufeld> FML
[09:40:39] <RWhitbeck> haha
[09:46:29] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: Can't you just trigger a normal Ajax request on click instead of navigate?
[09:46:52] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: yes, but in this case, a form is probably actually better, isn't it?
[09:47:29] <arschmitz> If a form is what you need it is lol not sure of your use case really
[09:49:10] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: it's a voting page
[09:49:14] <ryanneufeld> user has three options
[09:49:22] <ryanneufeld> one of each candidate
[09:49:27] <ryanneufeld> or show results (abstain)
[09:49:28] <arschmitz> Oh then yes form
[09:49:56] <ryanneufeld> yeah, though the form handler just redirects to the same url
[09:50:26] <arschmitz> I thought you were just triggering something from your original description 
[09:51:29] <ryanneufeld> you know how sometimes when you describe your problem 'out loud'
[09:51:32] <Mr_Grim> gseguin was that all you removed for PhoneGap to work? have you had issues with your PhoneGap application randomly crashing with anything else turned on/off?
[09:51:37] <ryanneufeld> you realize you're thinking about it wrong?
[09:51:40] <ryanneufeld> that's what happened to me
[09:52:10] <arschmitz> Yea lol 
[09:53:43] <ryanneufeld> I need no ones help to make a fool of myself TYVM :P
[09:54:06] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: thanks for being willing to help :[p
[09:55:08] <arschmitz> No problem I'm just home on lunch lol fucking off
[10:08:50] <Mr_Grim> my app still crashes :(
[10:35:37] <toddmparker__> hi all

[10:57:33] <toddmparker__> thanks RWhitbeck 
[10:58:00] <toddmparker__> we need to add/remove people based on who's there
[11:01:35] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: did you track down the test issue with the table branch merge? if not, we can help look at that
[11:02:28] <RWhitbeck> meeting time?
[11:03:38] <toddmparker__> yep
[11:05:25] <ryanneufeld> What's the recommended way to include page specific js? a script tag?
[11:07:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Only in so far as to identify that it is indeed happening in the table unit tests, and not elsewhere.
[11:07:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Also, timeouts are notoriously difficult to pin down.
[11:22:14] <maxlynch> Hey toddmparker I just updated the builder to 1.2.0. We've been slow lately...but getting back into the groove. 
[11:24:01] <maxlynch> we're also working on a few alternative themes which we'll put up on github, so I'll let you know when that happens.
[11:28:20] <toddmparker__> oh, excellent
[11:28:29] <toddmparker__> love to see those themes. there a preview maxlynch 
[11:29:17] <maxlynch> I don't have anything just yet, but I will send them your way when I do

[12:30:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: building now
[12:32:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It'll still time out. The table tests time out reliably.
[12:33:19] <johnbender> :(
[12:33:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Makes the job smaller though - therein the benefit.

[12:46:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we didn't get to discuss PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5223 - I'd like to keep it open for now so I can take a look at it when working on a demo next week
[12:47:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[12:49:10] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: ah, i wanted to ask about what we should do with these grids
[12:49:16] <arschmitz> johnbender: wanted your oppinion on something real quick
[12:49:47] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: why don't you give that a look and give me an opinion on how baked it is and what we should do
[12:49:56] <toddmparker__> leaning towards not trying to land this for 1.3
[12:50:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: as from next week I think I can fully focus on new docs/demos for 1.3
[12:50:14] <toddmparker__> but maybe making a few simple demos using these ideas
[12:50:28] <uGoMobi> so yeah, I 'll make a demo and see what I can use from that code
[12:50:29] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: that is awesome, i'll be right there with you
[12:50:34] <toddmparker__> ok
[12:50:49] <toddmparker__> so _|Nix|_ - want to talk about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2383
[12:50:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: So, I'll remove that don't-bubble and leave it in there for beta at least. What could go wrong?™
[12:51:07] <toddmparker__> heh
[12:51:33] <arschmitz> johnbender: its about the lack of teardown on touch events.
[12:52:00] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: seems like we'd spot issues if that was trouble
[12:52:09] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[12:52:32] <arschmitz> +1 for making the change
[12:52:34] <toddmparker__> going, going...
[12:52:35] <toddmparker__> gone

[12:52:45] <uGoMobi> no objections
[12:52:49] <_|Nix|_> Cool.
[12:52:53] <uGoMobi> another one... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5327
[12:52:56] <toddmparker__> ok, let's do this thing
[12:53:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: I'll do it as soon as my dismissible rename unit tests finish and I push /that/.
[12:53:23] <toddmparker__> seems like a good idea uGoMobi 
[12:53:25] <uGoMobi> I think in general it's better to not hardcode an option default like we do now
[12:53:41] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: damn spelling
[12:53:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: NP.
[12:53:49] <toddmparker__> yeah
[12:53:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Good you guys found the right one.
[12:54:04] <toddmparker__> i looked at a million times and didn't notice
[12:54:20] <toddmparker__> it was random...thanks google
[12:54:31] <toddmparker__> wasn't 100% sure it was a proper word
[12:54:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: I thought it was <verb>able === can be <verb>ed
[12:54:39] <toddmparker__> like "collapsibles"
[12:54:59] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: But I guess that doesn't hold for all verbs.
[12:55:15] <toddmparker__> just because english is my first language, doesn't mean i'm any good at it
[12:55:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: St00pid latin etymology
[12:55:21] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:55:32] <toddmparker__> in english, there are no rules, only exceptions
[12:55:41] <toddmparker__> and mysteries
[12:55:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: ... and yet, it is the most viral language in existence.
[12:56:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Films may not have been wrong about all extraterrestrials speaking English.
[12:57:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: ... by the time they get through watching all episodes of Friends and The Simpsons ... they'll be talking English to each other.
[12:57:19] <_|Nix|_> ... before they even land :)
[12:57:30] <toddmparker__> true
[12:58:08] <toddmparker__> it's cultural - if you want to watch all our tv and movies (and websites), you gotta learn english
[12:58:17] <toddmparker__> brb
[13:03:42] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: So, what do you think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/9610f801bacaa5f29dd2f792bb289b073575241a/js/widgets/popup.js#L851 ? Shall we reuse it?
[13:04:08] <jlembeck> debating whether it's best to do that on timeout or on the event of the widget opening
[13:04:40] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: If you have 5 different buttons that open the widget, you need to know which one to un-activate.
[13:05:00] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Although that's a good point, since I ended up passing the link into the popup as well.
[13:05:18] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: That code was from a time before I was passing the link in.
[13:05:29] <jlembeck> Yeah, I need it to grab info for panels as well
[13:06:29] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Man - panels (especially the overlay variety) are /so/ much like popups ...
[13:07:56] <jlembeck> really similar, except for nav
[13:08:09] <jlembeck> and that means I get to use WAY less code
[13:08:30] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Actually, not even: data-history="false" - BAM! No nav.
[13:10:03] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: I think I'll keep the timeout though, because I don't want the widget to concern itself with the internals of the link that clicked it.
[13:10:59] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Hmmm ... actually, I'm passing in the link, but it doesn't look like I'm using it - weird.
[13:11:06] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: All the more reason to keep the timeout.

[13:17:52] <toddmparker__> back
[13:19:39] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: shall we leave this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5231 for 1.44 when we look into active and focus styling anyway
[13:24:11] <toddmparker__> yeah, i don't think the tradeoff is very good there uGoMobi 
[13:24:26] <toddmparker__> not willing to lose focus styling for bb6's janky css
[13:24:32] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: popup has an event popupafteropen that it triggers when it is completely open and on the screen. You could do something similar for panel. Then, remove the active class from a one-shot handler of that event.
[13:24:52] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: I'm going to try that after the unit tests for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2383 finish and I push it.
[13:25:35] <toddmparker__> i think i prefer simpler event names like "open" where open means it's done opening fully
[13:25:58] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: ok thanks, I will set milestone and comment
[13:25:58] <toddmparker__> unless there is the need for more granular events, like with page nav
[13:26:18] <toddmparker__> k
[13:26:20] <uGoMobi> I agree removing focus style in general isn't the solution
[13:29:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Yeah, absolutely. I wasn't suggesting that jlembeck create an event panelafteropen. I was merely suggesting the pattern.
[13:30:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you have Nokia SDK installed?
[13:30:36] <jlembeck> Yeah, I fire panelopen, so it should be fine

[13:39:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah we talked about that with the infra folks on weds
[13:39:06] <uGoMobi> is that something we have to ask gnarf 
[13:39:13] <johnbender> uGoMobi: rm -rf on the server makes me nervous
[13:39:14] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[13:39:22] <johnbender> so I left it out when I built it
[13:39:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Also, switching to phantomjs 1.7.0 may fix the sequence test timeouts.
[13:39:36] <uGoMobi> I understand
[13:39:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: and/or upgrading node/npm ...
[13:39:56] <johnbender> uGoMobi: but, we have something that should work across projects UI, Core, Mobile
[13:40:01] <johnbender> so it's on the todo list
[13:40:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I haven't been able to reproduce that timeout with newer versions of phantomjs/node.
[13:40:09] <uGoMobi> great
[13:40:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm interesting
[13:40:15] <uGoMobi> thanks
[13:40:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: let me set up that build and then I'll try upgrading locally
[13:40:35] <johnbender> to see if I get the same result
[13:40:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[13:59:41] <toddmparker__> farewell 1.6.4
[14:03:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: source code view is better this way, right? http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/tables/phone-compare.html
[14:04:05] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: is it supposed to 'flash' when you click on the plus/minus?
[14:04:17] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: yes
[14:04:26] <uGoMobi> that is the popup repositioning
[14:04:47] <ryanneufeld> hmm... can't repos without it?
[14:04:50] <uGoMobi> maybe we could make it animate or something at some point
[14:05:09] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: no, that's part of the popup widget
[14:05:12] <ryanneufeld> I love the concept though
[14:05:21] <uGoMobi> I agree it doesn't look perfect
[14:05:41] <ryanneufeld> like, my boss would consider that a bug
[14:05:49] <uGoMobi> but have to reposition the popup because don't know the size of the collapsible
[14:05:54] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:05:57] <ryanneufeld> makes sense
[14:06:26] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: lemme look
[14:06:36] <ryanneufeld> odd thing is, when you collapse both, it doesn't flash, only when youopen one
[14:07:17] <uGoMobi> I did that on purpose
[14:07:31] <toddmparker__> i like the overflow and the fact that it fits onscreen
[14:07:37] <uGoMobi> if you just collapse both to see the demo underneath there is no need to reposition
[14:07:48] <ryanneufeld> but when you open it, it repositions
[14:08:19] <toddmparker__> how does it look if we don't re-position?
[14:08:22] <uGoMobi> yes, when code is shown we have to make sure it's on the screen
[14:08:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You mean the scrollbar in the source code view? Limiting the size of the popup to that of the window? It's awesome! I just hope you can pan the view on phones like you can scroll on the desktop.
[14:08:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nah, the scroll doesn't work on smartphone :(
[14:09:01] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: you can scroll on newer devices, older isn't pretty but this is for devs
[14:09:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Booh!
[14:09:07] <uGoMobi> could try overthrow
[14:09:16] <_|Nix|_> Sure could ...
[14:09:24] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: that should work on iOS 5/6
[14:09:26] <uGoMobi> yeah this isn't really mobile first
[14:09:31] <toddmparker__> and android 4+
[14:09:32] <_|Nix|_> It's true though that it's for devs.
[14:09:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: True.
[14:10:27] <uGoMobi> but I also added code to prevent the page to scroll when you reach top or bottom over the collapsible content
[14:10:58] <uGoMobi> scroll works on Android 4+ yes
[14:11:11] <uGoMobi> I think iOS5 was a problem
[14:11:14] <ryanneufeld> I love the popup with the css/html though. it's haawt
[14:11:37] <toddmparker__> yeah, this is a nice little widget for sure
[14:11:58] <uGoMobi> ok let me check without repositioning
[14:12:12] <toddmparker__> looks great tho
[14:12:22] <uGoMobi> now the height is limited it might be different story
[14:12:48] <_|Nix|_> Weird ... popup only repositions when the window size changes, not when the popup size changes ... I don't get it.
[14:13:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I trigger resize
[14:13:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: On the window?
[14:13:52] <uGoMobi> no on the popup 
[14:13:55] <uGoMobi> or container
[14:13:59] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK.
[14:14:00] <uGoMobi> not sure
[14:14:02] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ...
[14:14:21] <_|Nix|_> Dunno how we could handle this more smoothly.
[14:14:52] <_|Nix|_> This was designed for orientationchange, when the whole screen goes bonkers anyway, so a popup disappearing/appearing doesn't draw much attention to itself.
[14:15:12] <uGoMobi> I understand
[14:15:19] <uGoMobi> I abused that functionality
[14:15:20] <_|Nix|_> However, in this case the screen is nice and quite, so the popup's behaviour really looks bad.
[14:15:34] <_|Nix|_> s/quite/quiet/
[14:16:03] <uGoMobi> the point is that when you have just a couple of lines HTML and then huge block CSS
[14:16:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You should probably just move/size the popup by hand after it has appeared.
[14:16:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I would basically need the same logic in that case
[14:17:14] <uGoMobi> only thing is that it doesn't need to be hidden 
[14:17:19] <uGoMobi> before shown again
[14:17:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly.
[14:17:35] <_|Nix|_> You move the logic from the popupbeforeshow to the collapsible click handler.
[14:17:45] <_|Nix|_> ... and you don't trigger resize.
[14:17:58] <uGoMobi> yeah I could do that
[14:18:06] * _|Nix|_ is talking without having looked at the code.
[14:18:18] <uGoMobi> but it makes sense
[14:18:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This way, you could even get fancy with .animate().
[14:18:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Especially since it's not mobile-first.
[14:19:02] <uGoMobi> ohhhh may I ? :D
[14:19:24] <_|Nix|_> Hellz yeah!
[14:19:48] <uGoMobi> going to make the code fly over your screen :)
[14:19:53] <toddmparker__> i like fancy
[14:20:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, a simple first-person-shooter as an easter egg while you're at it :)
[14:20:22] <uGoMobi> hahaha
[14:20:37] <ryanneufeld> quick question about the history plugin
[14:20:54] <ryanneufeld> pushState rather
[14:21:01] <ryanneufeld> I have a form that is submitting the url
[14:21:20] <ryanneufeld> how can I prevent the duplicate item from appearing in the users history?
[14:22:30] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: use changepage with the option changeHash: false.
[14:22:56] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: so bind to the form submit?
[14:23:18] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Or to the pagebeforechange, and alter data.options ...
[14:23:34] <ryanneufeld> hrm
[14:23:39] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Or rather data.changeHash ...
[14:23:40] <ryanneufeld> :S
[14:24:21] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: You need only identify in pagebeforechange that the toPage is the form and the fromPage is also the form, and then you set changeHash: false.
[14:24:34] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Not sure, but we may have other ways to set changeHash: false ...
[14:25:02] * _|Nix|_ greps the code for changeHash ...
[14:25:10] <ryanneufeld> so, what's the recommended place to put page specific js?
[14:25:19] <ryanneufeld> clearly I can't put it in the head
[14:26:45] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I guess you could use a delegate and hook to pageinit: $( document ).delegate( "#myPage", "pageinit", function( e ) { /* code that will run when #myPage is fully enhanced */ } );
[14:27:17] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: You'd put that code into a script that's loaded off your start page.
[14:27:46] <_|Nix|_> I'm not sure how we are re: loading scripts from AJAX-loaded pages.
[14:28:15] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I think core will honour injected <script> tags, so you might be able to just put the <script> tag into your page.
[14:28:38] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's what I've been doing
[14:28:44] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Like, <div data-role="page"><script></script><div data-role="header">...
[14:28:46] <ryanneufeld> just wasn't sure what the proper way to dio it was
[14:29:33] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Be aware though that core now has optimizations to not execute the same <script> twice. So, if you discard your page and then navigate to it later, the script will not be run a second time.
[14:30:11] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: However, if you bind to things the first time the script is executed, those bindings will remain in place, so you shouldn't have to worry about the script not running a second time,
[14:30:26] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: ah, I see
[14:30:52] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Like, if you stick the above-mentioned pageinit binding in such a script, it will run every time the page has finished enhancing.
[14:31:16] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: But I'm talking core git now. Dunno how it is in the release.
[14:32:05] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: So be careful. Don't end up setting up duplicate bindings or you'll end up with weird results weird results.
[14:32:10] <_|Nix|_> ;)

[14:34:01] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 1452890cc 15Gabriel Schulhof: Popup: Do not pass link into open() because it is not used there.
[14:37:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: What do you think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2427? It's pretty old, and it seems people are not responding anymore. I guess our nav doesn't handle redirects. But, as kinblas points out in that issue, we really aren't privy to what's going on inside the browser in response to our request, so we cannot catch that that's a redirect.
[14:37:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: ... and I haven't received any description of the workarounds the commenter mentions so I might try those.
[14:38:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: I move that we close it. Let people reopen it if there's demand, but only if they can give us a specific workaround they want us to support.
[14:39:00] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: you still here?
[14:39:05] <ryanneufeld> yes
[14:39:13] <ryanneufeld> I'm always here, ZNC
[14:39:20] <arschmitz> for page specific js
[14:39:51] <arschmitz>  recomend one of 2 approaches either as nix suggested delegate on page init
[14:40:23] <ryanneufeld> script tag or delegate?
[14:40:27] <arschmitz> or use get_script delegated to pageinit 
[14:40:46] <arschmitz> i would NOT put it in the page
[14:41:30] <arschmitz> i actually just talked about this in a talk for jqueryasia :)
[14:42:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you mean $.getScript() that'll execute the loaded script every time it loads it - so he's gotta be careful about attaching bindings in that code.
[14:42:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ you do it using one
[14:42:48] <arschmitz> then it only happens first time :)
[14:42:59] <arschmitz> im looking for my examples right now

[14:44:14] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:44:32] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: it really depends on what your trying to do thats page specific
[14:45:29] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: also LOVE znc :)
[14:45:53] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: well, basically I have a self submitting form
[14:45:58] <ryanneufeld> like it submits t the same url
[14:46:05] <ryanneufeld> and I don't want it duplicated in the histroy
[14:46:05] <arschmitz> ok
[14:47:19] <ryanneufeld> any suggestions for how to do that?
[14:47:47] <arschmitz> what i personally would do is handle the submission my self with changepage
[14:47:57] <arschmitz> and set changeHash = true
[14:50:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You must mean false
[14:50:18] <arschmitz> lol yes sorry
