[06:25:04] <toddmparker_> good morning all - just catching up
[06:26:08] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott - I moved the text input issue up to a blocker for 1.2
[06:26:09] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4828#issuecomment-7637084
[06:29:46] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: do you just need wilto to confirm your PR for that issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4834
[06:35:44] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: did the popup focus change you made seem to fix the issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4797#issuecomment-7678842
[06:35:51] <toddmparker_> I know wilto was testing...
[06:39:07] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: that HSV example is cool. I like the slider arrows. That might be a nice addition to the slider plugin if you prefer to not have the input. Slider will still work w/o touch that way. Course, we'd still need to play back the slider value somewhere which is the advantage of using the input - control and feedback
[06:41:15] <Wilto> Whatup.
[06:41:25] <Wilto> I see I have some catching up to do.
[06:47:42] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: this was meant for you.... "uGoMobi: do you just need wilto to confirm your PR for that issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4834"
[06:47:53] <uGoMobi> good morning guys
[07:45:32] <toddmparker_> hey uGoMobi
[07:45:53] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker_
[07:45:55] <toddmparker_> i thought uGoMobi had a PR to fix the BB stuff?
[07:46:06] <toddmparker_> didn't know if you needed some BB testing
[07:46:10] <toddmparker_> wilto could do that
[07:46:16] <uGoMobi> nope it is Jasons
[07:46:21] <toddmparker_> if jasonDscott isn't here
[07:46:23] <toddmparker_> ah
[07:46:35] <toddmparker_> either way, maybe wilto should test today
[07:46:47] <toddmparker_> unless you other have BB devices
[08:02:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: For now, /if/ we choose to include a colour selection widget, I'd go with plain sliders, rather than the ones in web-ui-fw.
[08:02:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Then, we can work on the slider.
[08:03:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: In fact, I have found that the slider could use some separation from the associated element. Currently, the slider assumes that this.element is either a <select> or a <input>.
[08:03:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ... even though, technically, any <div> can be made into a slider by called .slider() on it.
[08:04:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: So, I was thinking that it might be worth abstracting away the slider a little further - making an internal class that doesn't support data-*-type properties at all, and that doesn't even have a this.element.
[08:05:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ... all it does is draw a slider. That's it. Then, we can have a really lightweight widget that instantiates such a class and configures it depending on whether this.element is a <select> or an <input>.
[08:06:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: This came up during my attempt to use sliders for the colour selection. I cannot very well add <input> elements to my popup, because those have to be part of a form, and may end up getting submitted. So, I had to turn plain <div>s into sliders manually, but then there's no way to specify min, max, value, and step.
[09:14:43] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: a slider that isn't associated with a form element isn't very PE
[09:16:27] <toddmparker_> i can see that you wouldn't want the HSB values to be submitted, just the final hex or whatever, but couldn't you inject outside the other form?
[09:17:23] <toddmparker_> i agree that the normal sliders are the way to go on the color picker
[09:18:20] <toddmparker_> this isn't a final decision or anything, but i don't think we'd add a color picker for a few releases because I'd rather focus our dev attention one more commonly used widgets
[09:18:39] <toddmparker_> that said, you should definitely finish this and we'll pimp it as a 3rd party widget
[09:18:54] <toddmparker_> it's really nice
[09:27:04] <toddmparker_> we may end up adding it later as an official thing
[09:34:19] <Wilto> hi what hello
[09:34:28] <Wilto> Sorry, pulled in twenty directions at once today.
[09:34:49] <Wilto> Am I testing things?
[09:44:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/crjsCg
[09:44:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Remove GPL - John Bender
[09:45:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: is it alright to add a link to the download builder in the README?
[09:46:12] <johnbender> right now it sounds like you have to do a custom build
[09:50:51] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/KuiEdg
[09:50:51] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] readme update with download builder link - John Bender
[09:50:56] <toddmparker_> johnbender: sure, good idea
[09:51:29] <toddmparker_> wilto - mind testing popup forms again?
[09:52:22] <Wilto> As long as I don’t have to touch a gross ol’ Android.
[09:52:30] <Wilto> Same thing as yesterday?
[09:52:45] <Wilto> And /test is good to go, or is this in a branch someplace? Reading back now.
[09:54:42] <toddmparker_> yep
[09:54:52] <toddmparker_> master - right uGoMobi and _|Nix|_
[09:55:05] <toddmparker_> for the popup focus testing?
[10:07:57] <uGoMobi> yes, master
[10:08:15] <uGoMobi> last focus related commit was 2 days ago
[10:17:17] <toddmparker_> hrm
[10:17:30] <toddmparker_> mat - if you tested yesteday, what was the result?
[10:17:37] <toddmparker_> wilto ^^
[10:18:39] <Wilto> Oh. On the Nexus 7: focusing the input would pop-up the keyboard, which seemed to trigger a resize event, which would reposition the popup and the input would lose focus.
[10:19:40] <toddmparker_> and the keyboard would hide = death loop?
[10:20:02] <Wilto> Nope. It would just reposition again.
[10:20:18] <Wilto> If we tried to automatically re-focus after, it would loop FOR ALL ETERNITY.
[10:20:22] <toddmparker_> and could you then tap the input and enter text?
[10:20:37] <toddmparker_> so it was two taps to focus?
[10:20:41] <Wilto> Nope. It would kick off the same chain of events every time.
[10:20:59] <Wilto> Tap to focus, keyboard opens, popup moves, focus is lost, keyboard closes, popup moves.
[10:21:15] <toddmparker_> seems to be a range of android behavior across versions
[10:21:27] <Wilto> uGoMobi: We discussed ways of doing that with CSS yesterday to avoid the `resize` repositioning though, yeah?
[10:21:29] <toddmparker_> so we still need to improve this
[10:21:37] <Wilto> toddmparker_: I think we had a plan.
[10:21:39] <uGoMobi> Wilto: yes
[10:21:46] <toddmparker_> seems like we should focus on this
[10:22:05] <toddmparker_> 1.2 blocker
[10:22:13] <uGoMobi> Wilto: we should try to do the reposition thing without blur/focus
[10:22:14] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Have you had a chance to look into that? With Todd VonBossman’s approval, I could take a crack at it today.
[10:22:27] <toddmparker_> Wilto: go for it
[10:22:33] <Wilto> Since we’re just centering anyway, I feel like we can do 90% of the work in JavaScript.
[10:22:36] <uGoMobi> Wilto: no, will be end of the week
[10:23:01] <toddmparker_> wilto can give it a look now
[10:23:06] <uGoMobi> waiting for my new system and have to reinstall everything :(
[10:23:10] <toddmparker_> too important to wait
[10:23:13] <Wilto> Adding “JS” ➡ “JavaScript” to TextExpander was the best decision I have ever made.
[10:23:19] <toddmparker_> i see. new computer?
[10:23:23] <Wilto> Also, “->” to ➡.
[10:23:30] <uGoMobi> yeah
[10:24:59] <uGoMobi> I should be up and running again by thursday
[10:26:29] <Wilto> I am ON THE CASE.
[10:26:54] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:29:00] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:45:09] <Wilto> Ahem. That should have been “since we’re just centering anyway, I feel like we can do 90% of the work in CSS,” a little while back.
[11:45:24] <Wilto> I never did learn the difference between CSS and JavaScript; don’t tell anyone.
[11:57:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: The non-associated slider is not a widget. We merely package the code in such a way that it can be used from many widgets.
[12:05:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: getting a new system/onboarding/consistency is why Mitch and I made Vagrant
[12:05:49] <johnbender> I don't imagine you want to go down that rabbit hole but if you do let me know, I have a branch on my fork of jqm that builds a VM to run the jqm site under apache
[12:06:11] <johnbender> I'm using a vm right now :)
[13:20:00] <Wilto> Popups are consistently crashing Android 4.0’s native browser.
[13:20:22] <Wilto> Been working on it, but nothing is jumping out at me. Anyone have thoughts?
[13:23:55] <Wilto> Related: y’know what’s incredibly frustrating to work on? A bug that crashes a mobile browser.
[13:24:52] <Wilto> Whatup, jlembeck.
[13:25:04] <jlembeck> Wilto: yoooo
[13:26:31] <Wilto> I am going to eat this Android out of spite.
[13:35:22] <toddmparker_> wilto - crashy huh?
[13:35:29] <toddmparker_> ICS or JB?
[13:35:56] <Wilto> ICS. JB is okay since the focus management was removed.
[13:36:03] <Wilto> ICS _native_.
[13:36:22] <toddmparker_> ah
[13:37:00] <Wilto> Checking Chrome.
[13:37:46] <toddmparker_> k
[13:38:27] <Wilto> Yeah, ICS Chrome is fine.
[13:39:17] <Wilto> Once more into the fray. I’ll keep you posted.
[13:45:43] <Wilto> …Of course the problem was the `_eatEventAndClose` function.
[13:45:45] <Wilto> cruel irony
[14:05:05] <toddmparker_> at least you know the culprit now wilto
[14:05:13] <Wilto> Kinda. Gettin’ there.
[14:05:24] <toddmparker_> yeah? encouraging.
[14:06:38] <Wilto> I’ve broken two test phones over my knee so far, is all. That’s cool, yeah?
[14:17:03] <Wilto> Okay. I give up.
[14:17:51] <Wilto> Wait, actually, no I don’t. I’m pretty much it for testing this, huh? uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: neither of you have ICS devices, right?
[14:18:52] <johnbender> Wilto: I do. Hopefully I won't regret this
[14:18:55] <johnbender> Wilto: 4.1
[14:18:58] <Wilto> OH YOU WILL
[14:20:18] <Wilto> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L178
[14:21:17] <Wilto> That line is the culprit. Swap the bound function for like function() {  alert("I am a terrible browser."); }, crashes. vclick ➡ click, crashes. bind ➡ live, one, etc., crashes.
[14:21:48] <Wilto> Also tried correcting ui.screen to ui.somethingscreen just in case the keyword was throwing ICS off; no dice.
[14:22:20] <Wilto> The “crash” is everything locking up, followed by a “browser is unresponsive” dialog. Choose “wait” and things kick back in after thirty seconds or so.
[14:22:31] <Wilto> This is upon triggering any popup.
[14:24:33] <Wilto> Any thoughts?
[14:25:31] <Wilto> ui.prefixscreen[ 0 ].addEventListener( "click", function() { }); Guess what it does! Hint: crashes.
[14:30:47] <Wilto> I even tried turning around and pretending not to pay attention to the Android, then whipping around and clicking on the popup link to catch it off-guard. Crashes!
[14:37:05] <Wilto> Oh, I tried nuking all the positioning stuff, too.
[14:37:12] <Wilto> Just in case.
[14:51:35] <Wilto> Officially throwing in the towel, at least for the night. Later, guys.
[14:52:29] <agcolom> hi and goodnight Wilto :-)
[23:49:09] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: It also crashes on the 4.0 emulator. I guess I can try my hand.
[23:49:49] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Thanks for identifying the culprit.
