[01:09:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/UlWt9g
[01:09:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #4910 - Typo in jquery.mobile.theme.css. Thanks @Mitch64 ! - Jasper de Groot
[04:00:57] <pangelovski> hi guys
[04:01:19] <pangelovski> what is the proper jquery way of passing parameters from one page to another
[07:16:20] <toddparker> uGoMobi: thanks for triaging all those popup tickets last night
[07:17:18] <uGoMobi> toddparker: my pleasure
[07:19:08] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I can test the android ICS z-index issues with the popup-simple branch today
[07:20:56] <uGoMobi> toddparker: do you agree this is an OEM/device issue we can't fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4744
[07:21:45] <MauriceG> Hi all!
[07:22:06] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[07:23:10] <MauriceG> toddparker: uGoMobi  I've found some popup issues. Programmaticalyl setting options and headers without corners.  Shall I open issues for them? Sorry Jasper ...
[07:24:23] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: sure
[07:25:03] <MauriceG> One ticket for each popup option not working or one for all?
[07:25:28] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: do you think the cause is the same?
[07:26:12] <uGoMobi> or are they not really related?
[07:26:38] <MauriceG> I don't think so.  corners: false,  shadow: false, and theme does not work programmatically.
[07:28:44] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: And if a popup with corners has a header-div, the header still has edges  (footer not tested 'til now)
[07:29:57] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yeah I noticed that corner issue
[07:30:30] <uGoMobi> no only headers but also footers and content if there is no header or footer
[07:31:25] <uGoMobi> not*
[07:31:29] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: yeah. I see now
[07:32:26] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I suggest two tickets... 1 for those styling/theming options that are not working and 1 for the corners styling
[07:33:41] <uGoMobi> I already tried to fix that last one with css by setting border-radius to inherit for header/content/footer in a popup
[07:34:18] <uGoMobi> but the problem is that you don't know if there is a footer or not
[07:35:05] <uGoMobi> we dont want div ui-content to have rounded corners at the bottom if there is a footer :(
[07:39:58] <MauriceG> ah, yes. I understand.
[07:55:08] <Wilto> “Once more unto the breach, dear friends.”
[07:55:18] <Wilto> johnbender: What’s the score, man?
[08:08:57] <toddparker> interesting - see this popup extension - http://is.gd/jqmpopup
[08:10:33] <toddparker> http://ghita.org/jquery/dynamic-mobile-popup
[08:10:55] <toddparker> uGoMobi: yeah, if you can help today, that would be great
[08:11:16] <toddparker> Wilto and johnbender - let us know when we're in a place to test today
[08:47:57] <Wilto> `androidmatch !== null && wkversion && wkversion > 534.13 && andversion < 4.1 && !chromematch`
[08:48:05] <Wilto> I understand if you guys never want to speak to me again. I do.
[08:49:43] <johnbender> Wilto: I think we're good to go
[08:49:49] <johnbender> since we landed the "no transition" screen
[08:49:58] <Wilto> Let me just get this gross fix in, and we’re good.
[08:50:18] <Wilto> …I feel we should keep the related issues open, however.
[08:51:23] <uGoMobi> there is still the z-index issue with input elements https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4844
[08:51:38] <uGoMobi> http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6721
[08:51:49] <Wilto> I get the feeling this gross fix will solve that.
[08:51:54] <Wilto> “Solve” with fingerquotes.
[08:52:00] <uGoMobi> actually i just tested it
[08:52:03] <Wilto> I’ll test in a moment. Commenting the hell out of this.
[08:52:06] <uGoMobi> and it doesn't :(
[08:52:15] <Wilto> Oh, I don’t have it pushed yet.
[08:52:17] <uGoMobi> popup-simple branch
[08:52:23] <uGoMobi> ah ok :)
[08:52:25] <Wilto> Ten minutes; keep that page open, yeah?
[08:52:29] <uGoMobi> fingers crossed
[08:52:34] <uGoMobi> sure
[09:43:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 2 new commits to popup-simple: http://git.io/udJSfw
[09:43:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-simple] Re-removes styles related to overlay fade. - Mat Marquis
[09:43:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-simple] Fixes #4816, fixes #4844, fixes #4874 — Prevents ICS native browser from appearing to render the popup overlay above the popup when a position: fixed element exists on the page. - Mat Marquis
[09:43:48] <Wilto> what indeed have I done
[09:44:15] <Wilto> Alright, no time for nigh-crippling shame!
[09:44:29] <Wilto> That is, I believe, the final fix. Let’s test the hell outta this sucker; all hands on deck.
[09:50:56] <toddparker> uGoMobi: mind testing that branch now?
[09:51:19] <uGoMobi> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4844 FIXED
[09:51:30] <uGoMobi> toddparker: on it
[09:51:35] <Wilto> “Fixed.”
[09:51:38] <Wilto> With quotation marks.
[09:51:52] <uGoMobi> nah
[09:51:57] <uGoMobi> well done
[09:52:00] <Wilto> It’s… a lot of UA-sniffing, man.
[09:52:03] <Wilto> It’s not a good scene.
[10:00:08] <Wilto> johnbender: You working on anything else?
[10:00:36] <Wilto> Todd and I are thinking it’s time to put this thing through its paces across all the devices, if you’re good to go.
[10:08:35] <uGoMobi> Wilto johnbender : when i go to popups page in the docs > go to scaling images examples > open a popup > click "back to popups" link .... the url doesn't change
[10:10:00] <uGoMobi> this is on Android 4.0.4
[10:11:52] <Wilto> …
[10:11:54] <Wilto> android
[10:12:09] <Wilto> 4.0.4 native browser?
[10:13:23] <uGoMobi> yup only native browser... just checked on Chrome
[10:13:45] <Wilto> do you guys know what browser i hate the most
[10:13:52] <Wilto> i will give you a hint
[10:13:58] <uGoMobi> IE6?
[10:14:26] <ryanneufeld> native android 4.0.4?
[10:14:27] <Wilto> it sounds like brandroid
[10:14:54] <uGoMobi> nah i dont have a clue
[10:15:00] <Wilto> it is meego
[10:16:01] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[10:16:02] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:16:17] <Wilto> Sorry; five minutes. The past few days have run down my ICS device’s battery.
[10:17:02] <Wilto> Also my sanity.
[10:18:41] <uGoMobi> what was the status on the non-scrolling?
[10:18:55] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4898
[10:19:05] <uGoMobi> was testing that one
[10:22:18] <uGoMobi> when loading the test page in portrait I can still scroll the page and the overlay is only the viewport height... then switch to landscape and back to portrait  I can't scroll anymore
[10:24:10] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Can you re-check the select bug you mentioned?
[10:25:21] <Wilto> I was unable to reproduce; I shouldn’t have closed it in conjunction with those other issues.
[10:25:38] <uGoMobi> Wilto: what select bug did I mention?
[10:26:02] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4844
[10:27:03] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I tested that one and it is fixed
[10:27:20] <Wilto> Oh, oh.
[10:27:26] <Wilto> I uh I don’t know why that’s fixed now.
[10:27:33] <Wilto> “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth” and all.
[10:27:38] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:28:54] <MauriceG> Wilto: You also have this saying ?
[10:29:02] <MauriceG> lol
[10:29:56] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: If you have a moment later, please take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/bwCsm/  (popup header/content/footer corner issue)
[10:30:13] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: you mean "een gegeven paard niet in de bek kijken"?
[10:30:17] <uGoMobi> :)
[10:30:26] <MauriceG> lol !
[10:30:47] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: sure, will probably after the meeting
[10:31:04] <uGoMobi> was also still looking at the collapsible set options
[10:31:08] <MauriceG> Einem geschenktem Gaul guckt man nicht ins Maul ...
[10:31:13] <uGoMobi> but first popup testing
[10:31:22] <uGoMobi> haha
[10:31:33] <MauriceG> :-)
[10:33:49] <Wilto> All people of all cultures dig free horses.
[10:35:05] <toddparker> agenda - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGEU3p7MbcdRpl8FHgT_U7FIXj-C9Nm1I-NJjyLPhTM/edit#

[10:35:14] <toddparker> i'm writing up all this madness for my update
[10:36:12] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: I've tested the above fix with FF, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Opera mobile emulator, iPad: all fine
[10:36:13] <uGoMobi> Wilto johnbender toddparker : popup-simple branch looks good!! nice job!
[10:36:24] <Wilto> Any of you have the original “popup appears under overlay” Android bug handy, triggered by the fade animation?
[10:36:30] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: cool I will give it a look asap
[10:36:55] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Thank you!
[10:38:06] <Wilto> johnbender? ^
[10:38:31] <uGoMobi> Wilto: you mean the issue ticket?
[10:38:35] <Wilto> Yessir.
[10:39:36] <toddparker> please test like crazy
[10:39:52] <uGoMobi> the link I've got is the one from toddparker but thats about inputs and z-index
[10:39:55] <toddparker> help me find all the popup issues we've fixed here so I can write it up for the meeting.
[10:40:10] <toddparker> uGoMobi: in popups?
[10:42:03] <toddparker> can you all test 2.2 for this bug too? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4791
[10:42:58] <uGoMobi> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/assigned/Wilto?labels=Popup&milestone=&page=1&state=closed
[10:44:10] <uGoMobi> Wilto: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6721
[10:45:24] <Wilto> …android 1.6.
[10:45:49] <uGoMobi> oh :(
[10:45:59] <uGoMobi> that was the link from toddparker
[10:46:06] <Wilto> And 2.0.
[10:46:07] <uGoMobi> sorry,not very helpful
[10:46:08] <Wilto> …Hm.
[10:46:12] <Wilto> No, no, it’s cool.
[10:46:13] <Wilto> I BLAME TODD
[10:46:51] <uGoMobi> DAMMIT TODD
[10:46:53] <uGoMobi> http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=18370&q=z-index&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars
[10:47:19] <uGoMobi> well... just search for "z-index"
[10:47:21] <Wilto> I think the fade thing was just something I turned up.
[10:47:23] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4915
[10:47:25] <Wilto> Opened and closed.
[10:48:04] <uGoMobi> aha you were looking for JQM issue ticket
[10:48:50] <toddparker> yeah. see the agenda. i'm writing up a list of bad issues and our fixes
[10:53:08] <Wilto> Todd: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4784
[10:53:52] <Krinkle> johnbender: So mobile is using testswarm and browserstack now?
[10:54:10] <Krinkle> (just reading back some stalk word highlights from various channels)
[11:00:15] <johnbender> Krinkle: has been for a while
[11:00:22] <johnbender> still sorting out some issues though :(
[11:00:37] <johnbender> Krinkle: "using"
[11:00:43] <johnbender> I have the job disabled until I can get ie to pass
[11:00:49] <johnbender> which is actually silly
[11:00:59] <Krinkle> ok
[11:02:21] <toddparker> meeting time!
[11:38:19] <toddmparker_> hey uGoMobi
[11:38:35] <uGoMobi> am I allowed to talk here Wilto?
[11:38:44] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker_
[11:38:45] <toddmparker_> so I randomly see 404's when navigating to those advanced demos
[11:38:50] <Wilto> Don’t look at me, man. Todd’s the ruthless dictator here.
[11:38:56] <toddmparker_> SILENCE
[11:38:56] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:39:02] <toddmparker_> NO SMILING
[11:39:11] <uGoMobi> oops
[11:39:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: what browser?
[11:40:01] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: default, 4.0.4
[11:40:03] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-simple/docs/pages/popup/popup-images.html
[11:40:07] <toddmparker_> 404
[11:41:51] <MauriceG> Wilto: Do you have an iPad ready there?
[11:42:05] <toddmparker_> reloaded twice, working
[11:42:09] <Wilto> Three, I think.
[11:42:35] <MauriceG> Wilto: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-simple/docs/pages/popup/popup-images.html  in landscape
[11:42:47] <MauriceG> Wilto: open "Photo Landscape"
[11:42:59] <MauriceG> Wilto: Turn to Portrait and back
[11:43:19] <MauriceG> Wilto: Page is zoomed in but not out.  Known issue?
[11:43:22] <toddmparker_> yesss
[11:43:31] <MauriceG> k
[11:43:41] <toddmparker_> MauriceG: if you rotate the ipad slowly, does the problem go away?
[11:43:48] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: do you see the issue with the url when you navigate back to popups from the advanced examples?
[11:44:26] <toddmparker_> we use accelerometer data to anticipate when you're rotating and lock the zoom temporarly to avoid the iOS zoom bug. You can see potential issues there.
[11:44:27] <MauriceG> toddmparker_:  seems so ...
[11:44:42] <toddmparker_> if you rotate too fast, we miss it
[11:44:58] <toddmparker_> the ipad seems to have different tolerances so it's easier to trick it vs. iphone
[11:45:13] <toddmparker_> fixed in iOS6
[11:45:15] <MauriceG> toddmparker_: Ok. Good to know. thanks
[11:45:26] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: strange thing: on the native browser... open popup in portrait > switch to landscape and back with popup still open > you can't scroll anymore
[11:45:29] <toddmparker_> ^^ that?
[11:46:01] <uGoMobi> no
[11:46:14] <toddmparker_> i have a 4.0.4
[11:46:20] <toddmparker_> need some steps to repro
[11:46:33] <uGoMobi> I mean... when you visit the advanced example pages and navigate back to popups using the link on the page
[11:47:15] <uGoMobi> then look at the url
[11:47:40] <uGoMobi> instead of index.html you'll still see the url of the previous page
[11:47:46] <uGoMobi> I am also on 4.0.4
[11:49:01] <toddmparker_> Huh, I do see that
[11:49:23] <toddmparker_> but if I refresh, it correctly loads index, not that other page
[11:49:33] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:50:18] <johnbender> uGoMobi: as far as that jshack is concerned lets definitely revert it if we can
[11:50:40] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok
[11:51:08] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: that url thing is also in master so it's not a regression
[11:51:18] <toddmparker_> johnbender: any ideas on that?
[11:51:28] <johnbender> looking
[11:51:31] <toddmparker_> visit the advanced example pages and navigate back to popups using the link on the page
[11:51:36] <toddmparker_> then look at the url
[11:51:36] <uGoMobi> johnbender: if the problem is fixed with the change in the css on 4.1 as well we can revert (probably also that test you added?)
[11:51:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah take the test out too
[11:52:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the advanced examples page?
[11:53:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: the 3 links on the popup page... scaling images, iframes, panel
[11:53:59] <uGoMobi> those are the advanced examples pages
[11:54:03] <johnbender> ah
[11:54:05] <johnbender> so visit one of them
[11:54:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: what am I looking for
[11:54:30] <uGoMobi> huh...now I don't see the popup screen overlay anymore on 4.0.4. native browser :(
[11:54:42] <toddmparker_> when you go back, look at the URL
[11:54:56] <johnbender> popup/index.html
[11:55:06] <toddmparker_> it will still say popup-images.html
[11:55:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: in which browser?
[11:55:25] <johnbender> maybe I need the issue link
[11:55:26] <johnbender> sorry
[11:55:52] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: is there an issue for this URL thing?
[11:56:03] <uGoMobi> johnbender: there is no issue link yet... i only noticed when testing just now
[11:56:11] <johnbender> uGoMobi: which browser?
[11:56:14] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: not yet
[11:56:17] <johnbender> I can't seem to reproduce it
[11:56:26] <uGoMobi> android 4.0.4 native browser
[11:56:31] <johnbender> and which branch
[11:56:38] <uGoMobi> popup-simple
[11:56:48] <toddmparker_> go to the popup page, click on one of those advanced popup demos, hit the back button
[11:56:56] <toddmparker_> look at the URL and it's wrong
[11:57:04] <toddmparker_> master to popup-simple
[11:57:13] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi - re: on the native browser... open popup in portrait > switch to landscape and back with popup still open > you can't scroll anymore
[11:57:16] <toddmparker_> what device?
[11:57:24] <toddmparker_> I can't repro on 4.0.4
[11:57:32] <uGoMobi> Galaxy Nexus
[11:58:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I think it only happens when the popup content is heigher then the viewport
[11:58:57] <toddmparker_> oh, that. Wilto is looking at that
[11:59:07] <uGoMobi> this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4898
[11:59:12] <toddmparker_> johnbender: I missed that link. (https://github.com/johnbender/applications-cat-theory/tree/master/perf)
[11:59:15] <toddmparker_> holy smokes!
[11:59:46] <uGoMobi> I tested the sample page provided with the issue and tested on popup-simple branch
[11:59:49] <Wilto> Je-sus, johnbender.
[12:00:01] <johnbender> what?
[12:00:14] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/johnbender/applications-cat-theory/tree/master/perf
[12:00:19] <toddmparker_> ^^ impressive
[12:00:29] <johnbender> thanks :)
[12:00:39] <johnbender> It was meant to be POC for the paper and DaveMethvin
[12:00:54] <johnbender> DaveMethvin has some legit issues with the effort/value ratio
[12:00:56] <johnbender> which I respect
[12:01:18] * johnbender gingerly taps his chest with a closed fist
[12:01:58] <toddmparker_> ok, i'm going to test removing this johnbender
[12:01:59] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b668b6006967354111f62caf96db37d63052bb52
[12:02:38] <toddmparker_> if i revert this in my local master and i can still tap the persistent navbar links when scrolled, that means the CSS fix is good, right?
[12:02:54] <johnbender> the test page in the issue is good
[12:02:56] <johnbender> and yes
[12:02:58] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: correct
[12:03:07] <toddmparker_> 4.0 and 4.1?
[12:03:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: checking on my android device
[12:03:13] <uGoMobi> I tested 4.0.4
[12:03:18] <johnbender> the nav issue in popup
[12:03:31] <uGoMobi> so only 4.1 still needs to be tested
[12:03:38] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok cool
[12:04:15] <uGoMobi> I just found out that popup overlay isn't working on 4.0.4 native browser
[12:04:24] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hmm can't reproduce on my phone
[12:04:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you'll have to ask Wilto about the popup overlay
[12:04:50] <uGoMobi> although I am pretty sure I have seen it working before when testing popup-simple
[12:05:07] <johnbender> uGoMobi: so I can't reproduce any navigation issue on 4.1
[12:05:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I clicked te "scaling images" link
[12:05:27] <uGoMobi> johnbender: it also doesn't happen on 4.0.4 Chrome
[12:05:32] <johnbender> then clicked the link at the top
[12:05:47] <uGoMobi> seems to be a 4.0.4 native browser specific issue
[12:06:30] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes that's correct... toddmparker_ and I see the previous url when back on the popup/index.html page
[12:06:30] <johnbender> uGoMobi: one thing I would look into
[12:07:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you might try setting and alert in the popup code for open tha does the bindings to the navigate event
[12:07:18] <johnbender> obviously if none of the popups are open then it shouldn't be running but maybe it is?
[12:07:29] <johnbender> that's the only thing in popup that would bleed
[12:07:35] <uGoMobi> ok let me test
[12:07:52] <johnbender> and I don't have to open one of the popups to reproduce the issue?
[12:08:29] <uGoMobi> johnbender: not sure if I tested without opening a popup
[12:08:38] <uGoMobi> lemme try
[12:09:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: without opening any popup it also happens
[12:09:55] <johnbender> hmm
[12:09:58] <uGoMobi> maybe it is not related to popups at all
[12:10:02] <johnbender> that's what I'm wondering
[12:10:17] <uGoMobi> I am going to try another page that has subpages
[12:11:38] <Wilto> Guys, I’ve reached an important conclusion, just now.
[12:11:59] <Wilto> This “web” thing is too complicated. Let’s just go back to using phones to talk to one another, yeah?
[12:12:25] <johnbender> uGoMobi: there's also a screen binding in the _create method that should really only be there in the _open
[12:12:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: if, for some reason the screen was still visible it could be getting clicked maybe?
[12:13:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you might try debuggin in _eatEventAndClose
[12:14:07] <toddmparker_> johnbender: success!
[12:14:08] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4663#issuecomment-8170858
[12:14:14] <toddmparker_> revert at will
[12:14:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so the css is already in place then?
[12:14:50] * johnbender assumes so based on the commits in the issue
[12:15:28] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yup css is on master
[12:15:34] <Wilto> What in the—…
[12:15:44] <toddmparker_> i hope so because it worked w/o your JS fixes :)
[12:16:01] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: you have that commit handy?

[12:19:06] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: "I just found out that popup overlay isn't working on 4.0.4 native browser" - i see that on the branch preview...but locally?
[12:19:07] <uGoMobi> johnbender: no it wasn't cherry-picked yet, I will do that
[12:20:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: right... I don't see it local, only branch preview
[12:20:37] <uGoMobi> I already it was working before... was testing local first
[12:20:52] <uGoMobi> already thought it*
[12:20:59] <toddmparker_> not working on either
[12:21:44] <uGoMobi> on popup-simple local the overlay is working for me
[12:22:02] <uGoMobi> only not on the branch preview
[12:22:12] <uGoMobi> what can cause the difference?

[12:34:32] <toddmparker_> preview can be minutes behind
[12:34:36] <toddmparker_> can you check the SHA
[12:47:18] <uGoMobi> ok cleared cache and now I see the overlay on both the branch preview and local
[12:47:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: ^^
[12:48:55] <uGoMobi> but now I get the 404 on the advanced popup example pages :(
[12:50:19] <toddmparker_> what is up with those? let's check the code
[12:51:53] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: maybe it's the data-ajax="false" somehow??
[12:52:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: could be
[12:52:40] <uGoMobi> going to try without that
[12:55:49] <toddmparker_> this isn't consistently reproducible for me
[12:57:34] <uGoMobi> same here... only occured after I cleared the browser cache
[13:02:05] <toddmparker_> so odd
[13:07:22] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: it seems to be very random
[13:07:34] <uGoMobi> i cannot reproduce it anymore
[13:08:49] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: would you be willing to do freelance jQM consulting?
[13:09:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: sure
[13:10:36] <toddmparker_> i'll introduce you to someone.
[13:10:56] <toddmparker_> they are looking for a few hours a week consulting on jQM best practices
[13:11:06] <toddmparker_> might be a good gig
[13:11:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: interesting, thanks
[13:11:27] <uGoMobi> where are they based?
[13:14:46] <toddmparker_> here in the US
[13:15:06] <toddmparker_> but phone/Skype would probably work fine. I told him you were in Europe
[13:15:12] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:15:13] <toddmparker_> just did an email intro
[13:15:28] <toddmparker_> my pleasure. i'll funnel more stuff your way if interested
[13:21:03] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: thanks, I appreciate it!
[13:24:16] <uGoMobi> grrr... I now get a white flashing page when navigating between popup index and advanced examples pages
[13:42:22] <toddmparker_> we added a fixed header to the popup index to test that
[13:57:53] <johnbender> toddmparker_: uGoMobi: so where are we at with all this crayzness
[13:58:35] <toddmparker_> this odd 404 has been cropping up for weeks but it's hard to repo
[13:58:40] <toddmparker_> it's not a regression
[13:59:02] <toddmparker_> tested 4.0, 4.1, Kindle Fire, all ok on that branch
[13:59:20] <toddmparker_> I'd like to do a bit more testing today and push to master if no regressions
[13:59:56] <johnbender> kk
[14:00:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: what's the request when it get's the 404
[14:00:17] <johnbender> the url that is
[14:02:22] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-simple/docs/pages/popup/popup-iframes.html
[14:02:27] <toddmparker_> for example
[14:02:34] <toddmparker_> those 3 advanced pages from popup
[14:02:49] <johnbender> does that happen on your local instance?
[14:02:52] <toddmparker_> they all have data-ajax="false"
[14:02:55] <johnbender> hmm
[14:03:08] <toddmparker_> not a regression
[14:03:12] <toddmparker_> in master too
[14:03:21] <johnbender> ugh
[14:03:34] <johnbender> toddmparker_: what about 1.1-stable
[14:03:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: and how many tries does it take to reproduce?
[14:04:35] <toddmparker_> sort of random
[14:04:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: can you always get it to happen in like 10 tries?
[14:05:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: if there's some upper bound you can do a bisect to find a commit that might have caused it
[14:05:07] <toddmparker_> i'll see if sometimes on android and ios just browing from home > pages > popups > iframe
[14:05:15] <toddmparker_> can't tell if i need to open a popup first
[14:05:32] <toddmparker_> can't find a reliable pattern
[14:05:33] <johnbender> (an upper bound on the number of attempts)
[14:05:36] <johnbender> bummer
[14:05:56] <johnbender> I'm curious if it's related to the nav alterations made because of popup
[14:06:11] <johnbender> wondering if it happens on 1.1-stable
[14:07:05] <johnbender> I guess that's a silly question since the docs aren't therre
[14:07:07] <johnbender> for that
[14:07:10] <johnbender> maybe the better question is
[14:07:14] <johnbender> does it happen elsewhere
[14:07:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ^^ I know you went to try that
[14:07:51] <toddmparker_> it only happens on those 3 links
[14:07:57] <toddmparker_> that i can see
[14:08:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: one thought
[14:08:05] <toddmparker_> but we don't use data-ajax="false" much in the docs
[14:08:12] <johnbender> the vimeo player might be fucking with the page
[14:08:20] <johnbender> the iframe
[14:09:00] <toddmparker_> all 3 advanced demos
[14:09:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: in isolation?
[14:09:12] <johnbender> that is will a full page refresh in between?
[14:09:18] <johnbender> *with a full page refresh
[14:11:12] <toddmparker_> yes
[14:11:20] <toddmparker_> i think because there are custom scripts
[14:11:26] <johnbender> orly
[14:11:31] <toddmparker_> tho i dunno if that is the only way to handle that
[14:11:33] <johnbender> I was looking in assests
[14:11:38] <johnbender> *assets
[14:11:40] <johnbender> checking the pages
[14:11:42] <toddmparker_> but i get a 404
[14:11:43] <toddmparker_> ok
[14:11:56] <toddmparker_> so i don't think it's the scripts per se
[14:12:57] <uGoMobi> johnbender: those popups example pages are the only ones where i got the 404
[14:13:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: very very odd
[14:13:44] <uGoMobi> johnbender: i didn't get the 404 before until I cleared the browser cache
[14:13:52] <johnbender> and it's not a background 404? it's a "bro the page ain't here"?
[14:14:05] <johnbender> I have chrome dev tools set to never keep a cache
[14:14:11] <johnbender> I'll go try clearing it
[14:14:24] <johnbender> uGoMobi: toddmparker_: how are you guys set up in terms of a local server?
[14:15:17] <uGoMobi> i am testing 4.0.4 native browser... don't have incognito or option to don't cache as far as i know
[14:16:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: did you say you _do_ see it locally when you test with your phone? Or is it only the branch preview?
[14:17:18] <johnbender> sigh
[14:17:20] <johnbender> nothing on 4.1
[14:17:31] <johnbender> uGoMobi: anything on 2.3 by chance?
[14:18:05] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I don't have a 2.3 device, can test on SDK though
[14:18:11] <johnbender> I do
[14:18:14] <johnbender> I'll test
[14:18:39] <uGoMobi> johnbender: so far I have only seen it on branch preview, not locally
[14:18:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that might suggest an issue with our server eh?
[14:19:15] <johnbender> if I can reproduce I can go take a look at the apache logs
[14:19:16] <johnbender> err
[14:19:24] <johnbender> I guess they're nginx logs nwo
[14:19:33] <johnbender> hopefully the php proxy has nice logs :/
[14:20:06] <toddmparker_> johnbender: i'm on a testing binge and popup-simple looks great
[14:20:38] <toddmparker_> Meego, WP 7.5, Nokia S^60, BB7 all good
[14:25:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: hell yah
[14:25:46] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I can't get anything bad to happen on 2.3 :/
[14:25:56] <toddmparker_> our 2.1 phone isn't happy but it's such a buggy pos
[14:26:00] <toddmparker_> checking browser stack
[14:26:08] <toddmparker_> i will check 2.3
[14:26:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: checking 2.3 here
[14:28:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: 2.3 works fine here
[14:28:28] <johnbender> tested all the popup samples
[14:30:05] <toddmparker_> my 2.3 did have that 404 issue
[14:30:26] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I can't for the life of me get that to happen
[14:30:44] <toddmparker_> heh
[14:30:48] <johnbender> I can't imagine that 404 of a page that serves normally has anythign to do with the framework but who knows
[14:31:12] <toddmparker_> random. cannot reproduce
[14:31:50] <johnbender> I'm tailing the apache logs and I don't see anything
[14:31:55] <johnbender> and you're sure it's a 404
[14:32:14] <toddmparker_> on my 2.3, the form sample scrolls the page, then re-shows the popup when you switch fields
[14:32:19] <toddmparker_> ends up ok, but odd
[14:32:32] <toddmparker_> yeah, it's a 404 with a ngix
[14:33:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so it shows you the jquery mobile header with the "Not Found" message?
[14:33:28] <johnbender> mine does not end up ok
[14:33:31] <johnbender> on focusing the form elements
[14:33:32] <johnbender> ....
[14:33:35] <johnbender> zomg
[14:34:55] <johnbender> it looks like it's trying to correct the page to make sure it's in the right place
[14:35:43] <toddmparker_> that is a known issue in android i believe
[14:35:48] <toddmparker_> it's messed up
[14:35:58] <toddmparker_> that's why i asked mat to leave the fixed header on that page
[14:36:05] <toddmparker_> so we can keep fixed in mind
[14:36:19] <toddmparker_> fixed should be used very sparingly. there be dragons
[14:36:31] <Wilto> Let me tell you guys—on a scale of 1–10—exactly how much I don’t want to script a solution to the overlay height when the popup is bigger than the page:
[14:36:37] <toddmparker_> I'm going to call android 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 all ok on that branch
[14:36:40] <Wilto> *Seventy-five*.
[14:36:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: fair enough
[14:37:18] <toddmparker_> it's wacko tho
[14:37:40] <toddmparker_> wilto said if you only use type=text, you're ok. we use password there so it gets freaky
[14:37:41] <Wilto> Remember, guys: https://github.com/scottjehl/Device-Bugs/issues/3
[14:37:45] <toddmparker_> documented  ^^
[14:37:59] <Wilto> “Any element that triggers the on-screen keyboard, when placed inside a position: fixed element, will fail to respond to user input when using anything other than the default keyboard. This includes Swype, XT9 or, it seems, any input method apart from the standard non-predictive keyboard.”
[14:38:11] <Wilto> Looks like it’s more just having fixed anywhere near the inputs.
[14:38:25] <Wilto> Which meshes with the bugs before.
[14:40:53] <Wilto> Do we have a normalized viewport height value exposed anyplace?
[14:47:22] <toddmparker_> johnbender: BB6 and 7 check out
[14:49:16] <toddmparker_> at this point, i'm going to say that this all checks out
[14:51:03] <toddmparker_> johnbender: I don't see any regressions of note that would prevent us from merging this into master
[14:51:43] <uGoMobi> I give up on 404 hunting for now
[14:52:01] <toddmparker_> there is one regression that we should look at but we can do that after we push this to master and maybe after beta
[14:52:43] <toddmparker_> seems that in WP7 (not 7.5), clicking the popup does nothing. I'm frankly not sure if anyone is using 7.0 anymore but it's worth noting. Master works so this is fixable.
[14:53:10] <toddmparker_> but i'd rather have more people palying with this code to shake out bugs sooner
[14:53:15] <toddmparker_> then leave it in a branch
[14:53:40] <uGoMobi> I will give those advanced examples pages another look tomorrow... the issue with the url not updating after leaving those pages remains
[14:54:48] <uGoMobi> same goes for the page redraw after navigating from example page back to popup index page
[14:55:10] <toddmparker_> something is wonky with nav there
[14:55:18] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:55:29] <toddmparker_> i bet those are both related to data-ajax="none"
[14:58:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: clicking the popup itself doesn't close the page on wp7?
[14:58:42] <toddmparker_> no, it just doesn't show the popup
[14:58:54] <johnbender> ???
[14:58:55] <johnbender> wtf
[14:59:08] <johnbender> clicking the link doesn't show the popup at all ??
[14:59:10] <toddmparker_> i have no idea
[14:59:18] <johnbender> thats bad
[14:59:35] <johnbender> my device must be 7.5
[14:59:37] <uGoMobi> only on WP7 or also IE7?
[14:59:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ahh good question
[14:59:51] <johnbender> checking with browserstack
[14:59:54] <uGoMobi> will check browserstack
[14:59:58] <toddmparker_> yeah, you're prolly on 7.5
[15:00:00] <uGoMobi> haha
[15:00:07] <toddmparker_> browserstack doesn't do wp7
[15:00:33] <johnbender> it does ie 7 though
[15:01:06] <johnbender> nothing :(
[15:01:07] <johnbender> farg
[15:01:12] <johnbender> well it aleast we can reproduce it
[15:01:31] <toddmparker_> just checked and IE7 works fine
[15:01:39] <toddmparker_> which is what WP7 is based on
[15:01:40] <johnbender> broken for me in browserstack
[15:01:46] <toddmparker_> really??
[15:01:55] <toddmparker_> not for me, same deal
[15:01:55] <toddmparker_> http//jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-simple/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[15:02:07] <johnbender> I started at the homepage
[15:02:09] <johnbender> try that
[15:02:51] <johnbender> "works" if you go directly to the page
[15:02:55] <toddmparker_> i did that just now. it's ok
[15:02:58] <johnbender> the dialog popup is fugly
[15:03:01] <toddmparker_> WHA
[15:03:08] <toddmparker_> no css = fugly
[15:03:10] <johnbender> doesn't work for me if you start at the home page
[15:04:10] <toddmparker_> you're right.
[15:04:14] <toddmparker_> i had to clear cache
[15:04:42] <toddmparker_> what if there's something wrong with the <head> contents somewhere
[15:04:48] <toddmparker_> or do you think this is all nav stuff
[15:05:01] <johnbender> not at all sure
[15:06:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I have an ie7 vm
[15:06:49] <johnbender> let me take a quick look and see if I can spot the issue
[15:07:51] <toddmparker_> try navigating http//jquerymobile.com/test
[15:08:00] <toddmparker_> and open a popup
[15:08:31] <johnbender> agh!
[15:08:34] <johnbender> closes!
[15:08:40] <toddmparker_> i got an erroe
[15:08:42] <toddmparker_> error
[15:08:58] <toddmparker_> Sizzle.error = function( msg ) {
[15:08:58] <toddmparker_> 	throw new Error( "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: " + msg );
[15:08:58] <toddmparker_> };
[15:09:09] <toddmparker_> 1.8?
[15:09:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah
[15:09:20] <toddmparker_> whew
[15:09:21] <johnbender> Wilto:
[15:09:36] <Wilto> oh no what
[15:09:40] <Wilto> oh god no more bugs please
[15:10:08] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/17eb6619a7e35a3fc229c8e206e51cc35dcaa078
[15:10:27] <Wilto> don’t judge me johnbender
[15:10:36] <johnbender> Wilto: lol
[15:10:44] <johnbender> Wilto: the closest thing again
[15:10:45] <johnbender> :)
[15:11:39] <Wilto> Oh, whoops.
[15:11:43] <Wilto> Oh, wait, no.
[15:12:04] <Wilto> I ran into an issue using the referenced page; it wasn’t working unless I crawled on back to it.
[15:12:05] <johnbender> is there a reason for getting the page again?
[15:12:22] <Wilto> That whole commit reeks of desperation.
[15:14:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: my local copy works fine
[15:14:22] <johnbender> :/
[15:14:25] <johnbender> in ie7
[15:14:35] <johnbender> gah
[15:14:37] <johnbender> its ie 8
[15:14:39] <johnbender> sigh
[15:14:42] <johnbender> uninstalling
[15:14:58] <toddmparker_> wait, you were looking at ie8?
[15:15:05] <toddmparker_> though you were in browserstack
[15:15:08] <johnbender> I was
[15:15:13] <johnbender> now I'm trying to reproduce locally
[15:15:40] <johnbender> I don't feel like setting up the browserstack tunnel to my local dev env right now
[15:16:43] <toddmparker_> so 1.8.1 is out now
[15:16:55] <toddmparker_> we should drop that in and see if that help this?
[15:17:07] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we can but I don't think it will
[15:17:28] <toddmparker_> worth doing anyway i suppose
[15:17:37] <toddmparker_> just so we're up to date
[15:19:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: our test suite passes against it
[15:19:24] <johnbender> or did until they made some changes in sizzle post 1.8.1
[15:20:07] <toddmparker_> i think 1.8.1 had some big sizzle changes
[15:20:29] <johnbender> it did
[15:20:34] <johnbender> but nothing that broke our tests
[15:21:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: our test against jquery-git is passing
[15:21:24] <toddmparker_> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/30/jquery-1-8-1-released/
[15:25:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ok
[15:26:01] <johnbender> debugging with ie 7 now
[15:27:37] <toddmparker_> cool
[15:27:43] <toddmparker_> i made a blocker issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4917
[15:28:01] <toddmparker_> not a blocker for merging that branch, but for 1.2 final
[15:28:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright well I found the issue at least
[15:28:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: let me see if I can fix it before we merge
[15:28:19] <toddmparker_> i'll be out tomorrow but will try to check in. wilto will be on duty
[15:28:20] <johnbender> so I can avoid the embarassment
[15:28:23] <toddmparker_> ok johnbender
[15:28:29] <toddmparker_> it's broken in master
[15:28:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: oh
[15:28:47] <johnbender> thought it was just my branch :P
[15:28:51] * johnbender feels better
[15:30:18] <toddmparker_> yep, just double checked
[15:30:27] <uGoMobi> off to bed.... later all
[15:30:43] <toddmparker_> if you go to /test/ and nav in from the homepage, you'll get an error when the first popup is clicked in IE7
[15:30:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi: gnight!
[15:30:59] <toddmparker_> wonder is whatever this is will fix that other 404 issue
[15:31:05] <toddmparker_> goodnight uGoMobi
[15:31:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ah
[15:31:31] <toddmparker_> anyway, it is in master. seems a bit easier to repo in the branch but it's still not right in master either
[15:31:33] <johnbender> this is hilarious
[15:31:38] <johnbender> just figured it out
[15:31:41] <toddmparker_> hahaha
[15:31:45] <toddmparker_> WUT
[15:31:50] <johnbender> the click handlin that's built in grabs the href attr from the link
[15:31:58] <johnbender> which in ie7 is absolute
[15:32:06] <johnbender> even though it's an anchor ref
[15:32:09] <toddmparker_> oooooh
[15:32:15] <johnbender> quick fix
[15:32:19] <toddmparker_> amazing
[15:35:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: where were you seeing the error?

[15:42:20] <toddmparker_> master
[15:42:26] <toddmparker_> click the first popup
[15:42:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: after navigating from the home page?
[15:43:08] <toddmparker_> yes
[15:43:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I just get nothing :(
[15:43:52] <toddmparker_> blank page?
[15:44:04] <johnbender> are you guys running the Canary ie7 builds over there? lolol
[15:44:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: no the popup just doesn't show
[15:44:11] <toddmparker_> heh
[15:44:11] <johnbender> no error
[15:44:17] <toddmparker_> odd
[15:44:52] <toddmparker_> on test or popup-simple?
[15:45:07] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm looking at local master
[15:45:11] <johnbender> I might be lieing though
[15:45:28] <johnbender> I just threw an exception to see if it gave me any visual feedback and it doesn't
[15:45:33] <johnbender> so gimme a sec
[15:45:33] <toddmparker_> on that branch preview popup still does nothing but there is a dealy
[15:45:37] <toddmparker_> delay
[15:45:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it may not have updated yet
[15:46:06] <toddmparker_> ya
[15:46:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: building now
[15:46:47] <toddmparker_> ok
[15:47:05] <toddmparker_> all i know if on browserstack ie7 on /test/ i see an error
[15:47:11] <toddmparker_> ok, gotta run!
[15:47:14] <toddmparker_> sorry
[15:48:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: np np
[15:53:23] <johnbender> ?tell toddmparker_ I don't get an exception on popup-simple it's the same issue because Sizzle doesn't like getting a url for a selector :)
[15:53:24] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[15:53:30] <johnbender> ?tell toddmparker_ I'm going to merge to master
[15:53:31] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
