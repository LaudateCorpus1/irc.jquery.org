[07:39:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Cleaned up the popup demos to add some transitions and tweak content to be more realistic. - toddparker
[07:40:18] <toddparker> Hmmm…I had to put a width:300px on the accordion on the popup page because when you expanded a section, the width would blow out. We need to give that a look?
[07:46:49] <uGoMobi> toddparker: already said to _|Nix|_ yesterday that we have to look into some kind of CSS base/reset for popup
[07:47:53] <uGoMobi> toddparker: while creating examples probably more issue like the one you just mentioned will come up

[10:12:01] <agcolom> gseguin: if someone makes a PR to somefile.html then one of us makes a change to that file, and then we look at merging the original PR, will that cause a conflict because the file was changed between when the PR was requested, and when the merge occurs, or will there be a conflict only if the same text is touched in both occasions?
[10:12:55] <toddparker> hi all
[10:12:59] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i'm here
[10:13:01] <agcolom> hi :-)
[10:13:06] <gseguin> agcolom: if git can not find a clean way of merging the PR github will let you know
[10:13:08] <toddparker> hi agcolom
[10:13:14] <uGoMobi> hi Todd
[10:13:14] <gseguin> and you'll have to do a manual merge
[10:13:23] <gseguin> and resolve the conflicts manually
[10:13:27] <gseguin> hi toddparker
[10:13:36] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[10:13:39] <agcolom> gseguin, ok. I've asked Maurice to create a new PR to be safe
[10:13:58] <agcolom> and offered to make the change myself & credit him in hte comment
[10:14:15] <agcolom> I don't like taking risks with git ;-)
[10:16:34] <agcolom> Guitar lesson is finshed... will go back online when home...
[10:16:46] <uGoMobi> later Anne
[10:17:41] <uGoMobi> toddparker i was looking for you earlier because of this one toddparker https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2425#issuecomment-5788992
[10:17:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2425 on jquery-mobile (DreifGenov; 8m, 6d ago): Second navbar on a page doesn't get active state for the second time
[10:20:58] <uGoMobi> toddparker: simple solution is changing docs that class="ui-btn-active ui-state-persist" has to be added
[10:21:45] <uGoMobi> toddparker: wanted to know if we are satisfied with that
[10:22:30] <MauriceG> hi all!
[10:24:29] <uGoMobi> hi Maurice!
[10:24:57] <MauriceG> hi Jasper! pleased to see you
[10:25:30] <uGoMobi> thank you, I can say the same!
[10:26:28] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: you are just here and I already would like to ask your help
[10:26:49] <MauriceG> you? me?
[10:27:01] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: see this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2425#issuecomment-5788992
[10:27:02] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2425 on jquery-mobile (DreifGenov; 8m, 6d ago): Second navbar on a page doesn't get active state for the second time
[10:28:06] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: You have created so many fiddles that you probably know everything about navbars :)
[10:29:29] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: what I don't understand is why ui-btn-active class gets removed in the examples in that issue thread, but not on this page http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/docs-navbar.html
[10:34:28] <MauriceG> I see this issue the first time. I was afraid, you ask me now, what the meaning of the Russian text is :-)
[10:35:20] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: haha... that would have been my next question ;-)
[10:36:09] <MauriceG> That's odd. I'm curious now. I'll take look.
[10:37:02] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: only difference is multi-page versus single page template
[10:37:43] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: thanks, no rush by the way... so just if you have time to look into it
[10:39:25] <MauriceG> yes, ok. It's friday evening ...
[10:39:53] <toddparker> hi MauriceG
[10:40:11] <toddparker> all - I just asked MauriceG to hang out here and help out more officially with docs/triage
[10:40:36] <toddparker> sort of more of the same, just nice to recognize the contribution to date and have him here an don calls
[10:40:53] <MauriceG> Hi Todd! Thanks again!
[10:41:07] <gseguin> hi MauriceG
[10:41:25] <gseguin> good to have you here, thanks for all the contributions
[10:42:45] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: again... welcome!
[10:43:32] <MauriceG> hi gseguin! Thanks! It is really a pleasure ...
[10:44:03] <MauriceG> Thanks uGoMobi!
[11:04:42] <agcolom> Hi MauriceG :-)
[11:07:01] <MauriceG> Hi agcolom :-) Nice to see you!
[11:07:18] <agcolom> and you :-) welcome :-)
[11:10:02] <MauriceG> Thank you! toddparker have shown me the way here to spend still more time with jqm ...
[11:10:38] <agcolom> Yes ;-) he is very clever ;-)
[11:12:39] <MauriceG> true, true ...
[11:15:03] <agcolom> Maurice, did you see my comment in https://github.com/MauriceG/jquery-mobile/commit/f969971c9027ddb4141167818a09e9f0859cbc2f#-P0
[11:15:03] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (3d, 8h ago): Docs: change "to to" to "to" (events.html)
[11:15:18] <agcolom> back in a sec... taking my daughter to club...
[11:24:03] <agcolom> back now...
[11:25:54] <uGoMobi> agcolom: busy day Anne... guitar lessons, club :)
[11:26:55] <uGoMobi> toddparker: just saw your comment on ready-only lists
[11:27:50] <uGoMobi> toddparker: i understand rationale and even think read-only lists look better when small... but not when combined with clickable buttons
[11:28:01] <toddparker> right.
[11:28:03] <MauriceG> Yes Anne, and I've answered and closed the PR already. If you like, you can make the change and no credit necessary at all
[11:28:08] <toddparker> in a mixed situation, it looks janky
[11:28:19] <uGoMobi> toddparker: i could look into solution to only allow mini listview for read-only list
[11:28:33] <toddparker> that might be a decent start
[11:29:03] <MauriceG> uGoMobi Yes.
[11:29:05] <toddparker> i understand that mini is going to be real tricky CSS-wise for all lists so I dunno how hard this will be to do
[11:29:08] <toddparker> but yeah
[11:29:32] <uGoMobi> toddparker: i just deleted all css for mini listview
[11:29:38] <toddparker> we have all sort of read only lists: numbered, formatted text, thumbnails, etc.
[11:29:56] <toddparker> how far along were you on that?
[11:31:06] <uGoMobi> toddparker: all mini listview css is gone and working on JS to disable mini for listview at all
[11:31:45] <uGoMobi> toddparker: that count bubble and mini listview PR has test page where you can see all mini listviews

[11:32:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] removed repeated work (Thx MauriceG) [1.1.1] - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[11:32:57] <uGoMobi> still have that branch but started over to make new PR standardize buttons and form

[11:34:20] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] removed repeated work (Thx MauriceG) [1.1.1] - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[11:35:13] <uGoMobi> toddparker: other solution could be to maintain smaller font/padding for read-only list and make the button for nested list a bit smaller than normal
[12:12:39] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ are you around?
[12:48:10] <toddparker> uGoMobi: seems like a nested list item should be a normal clickable list style. it's sort of just a dev accelerator to make lots of linked pages
[12:48:41] <toddparker> sheesh…just realized that we need to deal with nested list views in popups
[12:48:54] <toddparker> rather not support them and document that clearly
[12:49:54] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok clear, we dont touch the size of the clickable button
[12:52:43] <uGoMobi> toddparker: or some day we move nested listview to popup instead of page
[13:05:08] <agcolom> toddparker: Happy to document clearly...
[13:06:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Anne, which of the two read-only list examples you think is better?
[13:07:08] <agcolom> BTW tomorrow this weekend I plan to rewrite the popup docs to put it in the passive form, like all other pages. Hope that's ok with everyone.
[13:07:22] <agcolom> uGoMobi: checking now...
[13:07:26] <uGoMobi> agcolom: i love consistency :)
[13:08:01] <agcolom> Me too! I must be a bit OCD on that ;-)
[13:08:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: haha ... i am not unfamiliar with OCD ;-)
[13:11:47] <agcolom> I think I prefer the 2nd example (will all Lis same size)
[13:13:00] <agcolom> I like the idea of a mini version too, but if read-only and linked list items are to sit together, they should be the same size.
[13:13:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok i agree
[13:13:27] <agcolom> is that the general view as well?
[13:13:35] <uGoMobi> good to wait until 1.2
[13:13:45] <agcolom> oh yes!!!
[13:13:56] <uGoMobi> general view as in general opinion?
[13:14:10] <agcolom> yes sorry general opinion
[13:14:13] <agcolom> ?
[13:14:18] <uGoMobi> you, todd and me yes
[13:14:26] <agcolom> oh, Good :-)
[13:14:51] <uGoMobi> have time to think about a way to keep smaller size for read-only lists without a link in it
[13:15:16] <uGoMobi> i mean... since we wait until 1.2
[13:15:19] <agcolom> yes...
[13:19:17] <agcolom> Ok, I think I'm going to switch off... I'm dead! :-)
[13:20:07] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone...
[13:21:20] <uGoMobi> good night Anne
[13:21:33] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper
[13:32:04] <uGoMobi> I am off too... good weekend everyone!
[13:57:32] <toddparker> thanks all!

[15:17:54] <MauriceG> all: somebody tested the popups on iPad (3) ?
[15:20:13] <gseguin> MauriceG: the rendering is pretty slow
[15:20:22] <gseguin> is that what you're seeing?
[15:26:02] <MauriceG> no. in the docs the dialog and forn links just show a overlay.
[15:26:27] <gseguin> yeah got that too
[15:26:34] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ^
