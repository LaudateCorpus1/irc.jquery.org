[07:04:04] <Wilto> Checkin’ in before I drop off the grid—for the first half of the day, at least. How goes it, guys?
[09:32:51] <Wilto> http://ux.globaldev.co.uk/devicetest/
[09:33:40] <Wilto> Probably made the rounds already, but I loves me some data.
[09:37:26] <eddiemonge> opera mini runs on the ipad? cc miketaylr
[09:37:35] <miketaylr> eddiemonge: yeah
[09:38:16] <miketaylr> eddiemonge: apple won't let us interpret js with carakan, but it's okay if it's done server-side
[09:38:35] <eddiemonge> lol server side client side scripting
[09:39:37] <miketaylr> :D
[10:19:00] <toddmparker_> ...are we just not going to mess wit this at all until post 1.0?
[10:19:16] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2107
[10:19:17] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2107 on jquery-mobile, reported by adriancd (3m, 2w ago): scrollSupressionThreshold - scrolling smoothness impact
[10:19:37] <toddmparker_> kinblas ^
[10:20:30] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so the impact of that is once you move your finger more than 10 pixels, the browser's scrolling will take over and on some devices this means we will never get a touchend event
[10:21:33] <toddmparker_> and that's a problem because we bind to that?
[10:25:07] <toddmparker_> btw - a created a phonegap label and started tagging issues
[10:25:08] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=PhoneGap&sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1
[10:27:03] <kinblas> yeah swipe events are bound to touch events ... they set up handlers on touchstart and remove them on touchend ... and if we never get a touchend ... then those handlers stay active.
[10:27:30] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[10:27:34] <kinblas> .. oh and the swipe never gets dispatched ... but only on some platforms
[10:27:42] <toddmparker_> so what should we do with this issue?
[10:27:51] <kinblas> I really hate those custom events
[10:28:15] <toddmparker_> they are problematic
[10:28:20] <kinblas> for 1.0 we really need to make these custom events all work together
[10:28:26] <toddmparker_> but i'm not ayone would be better rolling their own
[10:28:26] <kinblas> I meant 1.1
[10:28:50] <toddmparker_> yeah
[10:28:55] <kinblas> yeah I know, but we need to make these things work better together
[10:29:00] <toddmparker_> event overhaul is a biggie for 1.1
[10:29:01] <kinblas> for example if you listen for tap and swipe
[10:29:08] <kinblas> you don't want a tap firing when you swipe
[10:29:17] <toddmparker_> right
[10:29:22] <kinblas> today they are independent so that is possible
[10:29:23] <toddmparker_> and they do now huh?
[10:29:40] <kinblas> also, I think the swipe events don't bubble up
[10:29:42] <toddmparker_> gotcha
[10:29:45] <kinblas> but the others do
[10:29:49] <kinblas> so there's all this inconsistency
[10:29:56] <toddmparker_> yeah
[10:30:06] <kinblas> toddmparker_: you see my note on the profiler stuff?
[10:30:09] <toddmparker_> ok, so i think we could just say we'll re-visit after 1.0
[10:30:22] <kinblas> yeah, touching that stuff at this point is a bit scary
[10:31:16] <toddmparker_> ok, i commented and removed the milestone
[10:48:19] <toddmparker_> call in a few minutes all
[10:51:29] <Wilto> Ready when y’all are.
[10:55:35] <garann> is the meeting in #jquery-meeting a real thing?
[10:55:54] <garann> s/real/public i guess
[10:56:06] <Wilto> Yup.
[10:56:21] <Wilto> We mostly go over stuff on Skype, and just paste some notes in there as we go along.
[10:56:30] <garann> cool
[10:56:37] <eddiemonge> mostly Wilto and i making interesting commentary
[10:56:45] <eddiemonge> well interesting to me anyway
[10:56:52] <Wilto> Hah, I’ve stepped down from note-taking forevermore.
[10:57:40] <toddmparker_> yep
[10:57:47] <Wilto> Or at least throttling the snark down to nil.
[11:01:21] <toddmparker_> garann: if you want to be on skype, post your handle
[11:01:43] <garann> sure: garann.means
[11:03:14] <johnbender> toddmparker_: can you hear me
[11:03:18] <johnbender> I'm about to hop off
[11:03:22] <johnbender> I'm online by accident
[11:45:35] <kinblas> Wilto: so it's wil-toe not wil-2?
[11:46:08] <Wilto> “Will-tow.”
[11:47:05] <kinblas> heh
[11:49:20] <Wilto> Old high school nickname—I don’t get it either, honestly.
[11:51:24] <kinblas> lol
[11:51:30] <kinblas> I guess Tow is better than Toe
[11:53:07] <Wilto> I have carefully avoided using it as a pronunciation aid. A 5'4" guy named “Wilto” and mention of foot-related things conjures to mind images of hobbits—maybe that’s just me.
[12:04:19] <toddmparker_> sergeyg
[12:05:51] <kinblas> toddmparker_: as long as the meeting is after 9am
[12:06:05] <eddiemonge> the call quality starts off good then goes downhill after a specific time interval
[12:06:25] <toddmparker_> yeah, it's terrible
[12:06:30] <toddmparker_> google hangout?
[12:06:54] <Wilto> Yeah, people seem to speak highly of doing that.
[12:07:17] <eddiemonge> doesnt it have a number limit on it?
[12:11:45] <eddiemonge> asp.net
[12:11:52] <eddiemonge> amirite
[12:14:36] <garann> we use google hangout for girl develop it meetings - there's like six of us, and it holds together well
[12:19:18] <Wilto> Aw man—Mango is in the building, folks.
[12:20:38] <eddiemonge> kinblas and toddmparker_ on that list test, are the background-image gradients rendered for every item?
[12:20:40] <Wilto> Well, almost. We’ve got new phones, and toddmparker_ and I are champing at the bit to download the Zune software and update ‘em.
[12:21:54] <Wilto> Who wouldn’t be!
[12:22:05] <kinblas> eddiemonge: it's whatever the default theme does
[12:23:12] <eddiemonge> hmm, would removing that increase performance?
[12:30:29] <kinblas> eddiemonge: yeah Todd tried that already ... he said it was like a 10% gain
[12:30:44] <kinblas> the bulk of our problems are related to enhancement
[13:13:50] <toddparker> yeah eddiemonge, i was surprised. i thought if i removed gradients, it would fly
[13:14:12] <toddparker> but t turns out that border-radius is slow
[13:14:21] <toddparker> not gradients
[13:14:34] <toddparker> tho i'm sure a flat list would be a bit faster
[13:14:46] <toddparker> culprits are enhancement and touch events
[13:14:53] <toddparker> primarily
[13:16:45] <eddiemonge> maybe ill take a crack at it this weekend if kinblas hasnt figured it out
[13:18:07] <eddiemonge> be back later. lunch time
[13:57:19] <toddparker> kinblas: did you see my email about that not opening on WP7?
[13:57:45] <kinblas> yeah
[13:57:48] <kinblas> meeting time
[14:04:22] <toddmparker_> yep
[14:04:28] <toddmparker_> hope somebody dials in!
[14:06:33] <kinblas> toddparker: you guys there?
[14:06:39] <toddmparker_> yeah
[14:06:45] <kinblas> are you on mute?
[14:06:46] <kinblas> :-)
[14:06:50] <toddmparker_> tho it keeps giving us lots of options
[14:25:47] <mwbrooks> Hi
[14:25:52] <kinblas> hey-oh
[14:25:54] <Wilto> Whatup.
[14:25:57] <toddparker> hey mwbrooks
[14:40:24] <toddmparker_> and i'm back
[14:42:14] <Wilto> Much like <time>.
[14:42:24] <Wilto> TOPICAL HUMOR god I’m tired
[14:48:07] <_nickel> kinblas: I love airport wifi
[14:48:13] <_nickel> got stuck taking my mac with me though
[14:48:22] * _nickel already misses his thinkpad
[14:48:38] <kinblas> _nickel: I've been mainly on the mac for a couple of weeks now
[14:48:46] <_nickel> sigh
[14:48:47] <kinblas> I feel slightly handicapped, but getting used to stuff
[14:49:01] <kinblas> it's mainly differences in the apps I use that are bugging me
[14:49:04] <_nickel> kinblas: my setup in linux is fairly heavily customized too
[14:49:06] <kinblas> and the plethora of windows
[14:49:13] * _nickel runs to catch another flight
[14:49:18] <_nickel> HAVE FUN KIDS!
[14:49:21] <kinblas> see ya
[14:49:43] <Wilto> So, Mango seems snappy as hell—including the gigantic performance test page.
[14:49:54] <Wilto> Slow to load initially, but kind of impressive how responsive it is after the fact.
[14:54:44] <eddiemonge> i found quite the opposite yesterday
[14:54:52] <eddiemonge> but maybe it was the network
[15:15:27] <toddmparker_> leaving...
[15:15:29] <toddmparker_> see ya
[17:33:35] <Wilto> I wonder if something like this is worth investigating: https://gist.github.com/938767
[17:41:42] <Wilto> If DOM manipulation is doing the bulk of the performance damage, maybe we can apply this kinda technique in a few key places?
[17:42:20] <eddiemonge> removing the elements from the DOM when trying to scroll them seems ..... not right
[17:43:22] <eddiemonge> Wilto: theres also the jquery way to do it of see ? detach
[17:43:23] <bot-t> Wilto, .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[18:03:51] <Wilto> Well, I’m just thinking of the enhancement.
[18:05:00] <Wilto> We pop elements off the DOM, enhance ‘em, and reattach. It won’t help the scrolling I wouldn’t think, but in general.
[18:13:15] <aaronmcadam> yep yep
[18:13:36] <aaronmcadam> I've had a few cursory glances over the source, there's a lot of pseudo selectors which are bad for perf
[18:13:47] <aaronmcadam> but unavoidable really for what we need
[18:14:02] <aaronmcadam> selectors for checking ui-theme-x
[18:17:14] <eddiemonge> all the data-attrib selectors kill me everytime i see them, which is a lot
[18:18:27] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[18:18:44] <aaronmcadam> I can imagine the overhead of the :jqmData selector too
