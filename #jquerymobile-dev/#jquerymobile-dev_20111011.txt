[02:31:20] <aaronmcadam> hey toddparker, is it possible to use the search filter on a list of inputs, i.e. inside a fieldset with data-role="controlgroup"
[08:11:30] <toddparker> aaronmcadam - I don't think so
[08:11:45] <toddparker> add it to the feature request wiki!
[08:18:12] <johnbender> toddparker: the issue with the arrow formatted list view is a prime target for bisect if it was working in rc1
[08:19:19] <johnbender> toddparker: now I'm confused since he says "worked in RC1" but we haven't released RC2 yet
[08:20:24] <toddparker> not working in latest
[08:20:28] <toddparker> ok in RC1
[08:20:35] <toddparker> mat is going to give this a look today
[08:20:45] <toddparker> the buttons are so fragile, css-wise
[08:20:53] <toddparker> too many buggy browsers
[08:21:08] <toddparker> johnbender: can you review this pull? i'd like to fix this issue

[08:21:21] <toddparker> if the value is pre-filled, it doesn't auto-grow
[08:21:25] <toddparker> old issue, old pull
[08:21:33] <toddparker> still a clean merge
[08:21:37] <toddparker> just want your eyes
[08:22:48] <johnbender> toddparker: ah!
[08:23:02] <johnbender> that makes perfect sense
[08:23:10] <johnbender> kk
[08:23:19] <johnbender> toddparker: yah bisect should make short work of that listview bug
[08:23:51] <johnbender> toddparker: looking at the issue
[08:29:59] <toddparker> ok, thanks
[08:30:10] <toddparker> on the textarea...
[08:30:23] <toddparker> just got this comment:
[08:30:24] <toddparker> @toddparker, I missed that. However, note that it does not address a related issue where the textarea does not shrink in size when text is removed ("Another issue is that the textarea only increases in size: when text is removed, it does not become smaller again.").
[08:30:40] <toddparker> so we need to look at the resize when content is removed
[08:31:52] <toddparker> here is the issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/509
[08:31:53] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #509 on jquery-mobile, reported by gillespasse (10m, 3w ago): Textarea doesn't AutoGrow height with pre-filled values
[08:36:45] <johnbender> toddparker: I'd like to avoid adding more setTimeouts as a solution to miscalculated height
[08:36:54] <johnbender> so I'm going to see if thats possible
[08:37:16] <johnbender> sadly after the qunit upgrade our test suite runner doesn't report failures (though the CI build will)
[08:37:19] <johnbender> and has
[08:43:07] <johnbender> fixed
[08:56:49] <Wilto> Afternoon, gentlemen.
[09:42:55] <toddparker> johnbender: agree on the timeouts
[09:43:05] <toddparker> if you can figure out a better solution, go for it
[09:43:10] <toddparker> hey Wilto

[10:20:26] <johnbender> though a huge spead up would be extremely nice
[10:20:29] <johnbender> *speed
[10:20:41] <johnbender> I might look at automating that with vagrant if possible
[10:21:04] <johnbender> I only took a cursory look
[10:33:39] <toddparker> i already have virtual box installed for webs so this might be easy
[10:33:51] <toddparker> tho i still generally only test on actual devices.
[10:33:57] <toddparker> luxury for me
[10:40:04] <johnbender> toddparker: I should have shown you vagrant at jqcon
[10:40:26] <johnbender> the filament group is really the target audience
[10:40:35] <johnbender> people switching between projects
[10:40:47] <johnbender> who don't want to bother with the infrastructure setup for a given website
[10:40:56] <johnbender> in your case designers
[10:41:01] <johnbender> front end folks
[10:41:15] <johnbender> toddparker: as a side note I'm going to merge that pull request and make my change
[10:41:27] <johnbender> it works find on document ready
[10:41:29] <johnbender> *fine
[10:41:33] <johnbender> which makes sense
[10:48:40] <Wilto> I mean, Filament Group has access to *a* vagrant, in that I am here. Does that count?
[10:49:32] <Wilto> I’ll be here all week, folks. Try the veal.
[10:53:15] <johnbender> lol
[10:53:18] <johnbender> well played sir
[10:53:35] <Wilto> Thank you, thank you.
[11:00:46] <kinblas> heh the filament group is just full of comedians

[12:47:21] <Wilto> Hey johnbender, you got an Android 2.3 gizmo handy?
[12:47:46] <Wilto> Actually, scratch that—I think we’re good.
[12:58:12] <toddparker> kinblas - I think it would be super helpful to add a new page in the docs that talks about PhoneGap tips
[12:58:20] <toddparker> you have some good nuggets in tickets
[13:04:00] <Wilto> Hey johnbender: Todd mentioned something about a “bisect” earlier, but I missed the details.
[13:04:09] <Wilto> What, uh… What is that?
[13:07:40] <johnbender> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/optimization-and-performance.html
[13:07:40] <TehShrike|Work> Phonegap tips are a great idea
[13:07:40] <johnbender> "Conclusion: The journey down the road of mobile HTML5 apps is just beginning. Now you see the very simple and basic underpinnings of a mobile “framework” built solely around HTML5 and it’s supporting technologies. I think it’s important for developers to work with and address these features at their core and not masked by a wrapper."
[13:07:41] <johnbender> ugh
[13:07:41] <johnbender> good luck
[13:07:41] <TehShrike|Work> Yeah, that will happen
[13:07:41] <TehShrike|Work> Right after everyone starts using the One True Browser
[13:07:41] <johnbender> toddparker: I sincerely wish we had a list of the browser bugs we've filed
[13:07:41] <johnbender> and all the little hacks/quirks we've smoothed over
[13:07:41] <todd_> i know johnbender
[13:07:42] <todd_> that's the hard part, really making it work

[13:09:11] <toddparker> thanks johnbender
[13:10:39] <toddparker> johnbender: wilt needs a lesson on bisect (me too)
[13:10:40] <johnbender> Wilto so what I was saying about bisect
[13:10:43] <johnbender> kk
[13:10:46] <toddparker> ha! Wilto
[13:10:47] <johnbender> one sec just pushing a test fix
[13:10:51] <toddparker> k
[13:12:18] <johnbender> alright
[13:12:34] <johnbender> git bisect start
[13:12:44] <johnbender> git bisect good 1.0rc1
[13:12:48] <johnbender> git bisect bad
[13:12:55] <johnbender> that will start the bisect
[13:13:07] <johnbender> now you need to figure out if the issue still exists
[13:13:22] <johnbender> sorry I should have mentioned that having an easy to refresh page that reproduces the issue is important
[13:13:33] <Wilto> Cool, cool.
[13:13:55] <johnbender> afte those commands you'll be on a commit that's roughly half way from the good to the bad
[13:14:04] <johnbender> once you've determined if the issue still persists
[13:14:16] <johnbender> you issue a ...
[13:14:18] <johnbender> git bisect good
[13:14:21] <johnbender> if it was ok
[13:14:23] <johnbender> or a ...
[13:14:25] <johnbender> git bisect bad
[13:14:29] <johnbender> if the issue exists at that commit
[13:14:42] <johnbender> it will then take you either forward or backward in history half way
[13:14:43] <Wilto> Ahh.
[13:14:45] <johnbender> its a binary search
[13:14:49] <Wilto> So it’s a timeline kind of thing.
[13:14:52] <johnbender> yep
[13:15:04] <johnbender> and if you've dont it right at the end it will point you at the offending commit
[13:15:27] <johnbender> then if someone did a merge commit that changed 800 files, feel free to through something at them
[13:15:31] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[13:15:45] <Wilto> Oh, I’ve already made up my mind to blame Todd.
[13:15:50] <johnbender> fair enough
[13:15:57] <Wilto> Actually, scottjehl isn’t here: WHAT THE HELL, SCOTT!?
[13:16:43] <Wilto> So, do all this from master, yeah?
[13:21:09] <Wilto> …Oh, this is cool.
[13:30:00] <johnbender> Wilto yes
[13:30:05] <johnbender> it finds bugs for you
[13:30:11] <johnbender> kinblas: fixed that navtest
[13:30:22] <Wilto> Is this checking every commit, though?
[13:30:29] <johnbender> nope
[13:30:50] <johnbender> Wilto: log n commits
[13:38:37] <kinblas> johnbender: so was it my fault?
[13:38:40] <kinblas> :-)
[13:39:43] <Wilto> Dude, kinblas, blame Todd.
[13:39:59] <kinblas> Wilto: for?
[13:40:08] <Wilto> Literally anything.
[13:40:11] * kinblas is clueless at the moment
[13:40:13] <kinblas> heh
[13:41:27] <johnbender> kinblas: the test just expected the page id in the hash and not the pathname + search
[13:41:37] <johnbender> which made sense prior to that change
[13:42:08] <johnbender> kinblas: in reality it was my fault for not double checking the test suite runner results afte the qunit upgrade
[13:59:40] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm looking at the requirejs source to see if we can use that for dep definition

[14:29:03] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2558 on jquery-mobile, reported by kurteknikk (1w, 6d ago): Dialog's parent page shouldn't be removed when dialog is open
[14:29:17] <toddparker> reduced to medium, removed assignment and RC2 milestone
[14:29:30] <toddparker> sort of a bug/feature request
[14:29:47] <toddparker> i think eh way it works now is at least consistent from the ajax clean POV
[14:30:11] <toddparker> but since e handle dialogs as special case pages (can't bookmark, etc.), their parent page is sort of a special case IMHO
[14:31:13] <johnbender> toddparker: indeed, I can only comment on the practical reality that it's easier to retain than remove with the current codebase
[14:31:28] <johnbender> sounds like it's handled for now
[14:31:30] <johnbender> onward!
[14:32:38] <toddparker> easier to retain the parent of the dialog?
[14:32:48] <toddparker> ah, i re-read and understand
[14:50:07] <kinblas> toddparker: regarding that sample for Apple, I can certainly conjour up something ... but wasn't sure if johnbender wanted to do it or not

[14:50:50] <johnbender> happy to do it after that

[14:53:28] <johnbender> luckily I've set up autoturrets so its not likely to happen again :P
[14:54:51] <kinblas> johnbender: that reminds me, where did we end up with that rel="external" dialog bug?
[14:55:38] <kinblas> johnbender: to refresh, it had to do with the fact that when we initialize the app we aren't searching for data-role="dialog" in the body, we are just looking for pages
[14:57:52] <johnbender> kinblas: feature request
[14:57:58] <johnbender> the autoturrets killed that one
