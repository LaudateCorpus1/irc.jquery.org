[03:15:47] <uGoMobi> it was arschmitz his last commit
[03:15:50] <uGoMobi> going to revert
[03:15:59] <agcolom> you mean http://jquerymobile.com/test ?
[03:16:59] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that one is working
[03:17:11] <agcolom> yes, which one is broken?
[03:17:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but if you try to browse the docs local it doesn't work anymore
[03:18:17] <agcolom> you mean when you download a local version?
[03:18:20] <uGoMobi> I only see the front page and when you try to nav to a page it downloads it
[03:18:33] <uGoMobi> just local git

[04:24:25] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: sorry, couldn't figure out where G was used, thought it was a leftover
[04:24:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: good morning
[04:25:04] <toddmparker___> you can restore if you want, but if it's just for PHP in view source, might not be worth the weight
[04:25:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: no problem, should have added a comment there
[04:25:08] <toddmparker___> morning uGoMobi 
[04:25:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I was about to say the same... was a bit much for just a few PHP examples anyway
[04:25:59] <toddmparker___> agreed
[04:26:22] <toddmparker___> we can use a or something
[04:26:39] <toddmparker___> color coding gets tricky at a certain point
[04:26:39] <uGoMobi> nice work on the demo pages!
[04:27:07] <toddmparker___> thanks, was hoping you'd like that approach
[04:27:11] <uGoMobi> I do
[04:27:26] <toddmparker___> it's cool to see all the listview stuff all at once.
[04:27:45] <toddmparker___> this doesn't cover every variation like the earlier one did, but it gives a nice overview
[04:27:49] <uGoMobi> swatch A doesn't have much contrast with bg of the code so I think for now swatch D is fine
[04:27:52] <toddmparker___> feel free to add more variations at the bottom
[04:28:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: the earlier one was just to have the markup there
[04:28:14] <toddmparker___> was thinking we could add a few that have more theming applied
[04:28:22] <toddmparker___> at the bottom
[04:28:40] <uGoMobi> yes we do need to add more theming examples
[04:28:42] <toddmparker___> maybe you can help me by figuring out how to actually implement these new styles
[04:28:45] <toddmparker___> i hacked 'em in
[04:29:24] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: ok I will look at that
[04:31:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___:  if we make the pages too long they might become a bit too heavy if you load them on a mobile device
[04:32:05] <uGoMobi> I like it when you have an overview on one page
[04:32:27] <uGoMobi> but I also noticed with slider demo page for example that it became too heavy for Android
[04:33:19] <toddmparker___> that could be a problem
[04:33:58] <toddmparker___> maybe we should keep working on perf so we can do longer pages :)
[04:34:11] <uGoMobi> lol
[04:35:24] <toddmparker___> at this point, we should work out a clean template
[04:35:31] <toddmparker___> in general
[04:35:45] <toddmparker___> make it easier to port stuff in
[04:35:52] <uGoMobi> true
[04:36:03] <uGoMobi> there is a demo_template folder
[04:36:13] <uGoMobi> with template file
[04:36:21] <uGoMobi> we can adjust that
[04:36:31] <toddmparker___> maybe we can revise that and make a template for widgets, Q&A, etc.
[04:36:40] <uGoMobi> yeah
[04:36:46] <toddmparker___> <div class="content-primary">
[04:37:35] <toddmparker___> ^^ think we can remove that now. i still have in my pages out of habit but if we want to show the leftnav panel at wider widths, we have a different way
[04:38:07] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: true
[04:38:34] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I added that for the new layout you showed earlier
[04:38:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: but we have the panel widget now
[04:38:47] <toddmparker___> yeah?
[04:38:50] <toddmparker___> oh, right
[04:39:07] <toddmparker___> we need to get that panel include working, saw you reverted the .htaccess
[04:39:23] <uGoMobi> yes that broke latest
[04:39:49] <toddmparker___> on the server or just locally?
[04:39:55] <uGoMobi> just local
[04:40:19] <toddmparker___> any ideas on that one?
[04:40:32] <uGoMobi> thought it might be better to revert first
[04:41:02] <uGoMobi> no not yet
[04:41:28] <uGoMobi> what happened was that files were downloaded instead of loaded in the browser
[04:41:56] <toddmparker___> right
[04:46:53] <toddmparker___> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8315780/htaccess-causing-index-php-to-download
[04:53:20] <uGoMobi> I think we need to add RemoveHandler .html
[04:55:57] <uGoMobi> and the .htaccess should probably go in the docs folder, not the root
[04:57:51] <uGoMobi> that seems to work
[04:58:59] <toddmparker___> cool!
[04:59:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: did your inventory included all files in the docs?
[04:59:19] <uGoMobi> we can use that for the redirects in the .htaccess
[05:02:06] <toddmparker___> nice

[07:18:15] <toddmparker___> maybe gnarf would have ideas
[07:18:19] <uGoMobi> yeah

[07:29:56] <toddmparker___> having trouble getting it to work both locally and on the server
[07:35:01] <gseguin> and the php that's in /js doesn't work for you toddmparker___ ?
[07:37:37] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi said it works locally but not up on /test/
[07:38:00] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: dangit. tried to use anchor links inside a popup and no dice.

[07:51:54] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi and arschmitz - I added a jump to section link with popup
[07:51:56] <toddmparker___> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/buttons/index.html
[07:52:23] <toddmparker___> probably need better styles for that link, maybe add a arrow
[07:53:18] <toddmparker___> if we like this idea, we might want to automate - generate the menu based on the h2's on the page
[07:56:28] <toddmparker___> _|Nix|_: be cool to see if we can make the anchors work in a popup

[08:10:20] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: think a right panel would be better for the quick jump menu?
[08:11:03] <toddmparker___> looks like an anchor doesn't work in either a popup or panel - using the data-ajax technique arschmitz suggested. that only works on a page
[08:11:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: on desktop I actually like the popup
[08:15:53] <toddmparker___> i do too, but on a phone with a longer list, it feels a bit odd
[08:16:08] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: pushing up a panel version for comparison
[08:16:13] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:16:31] <toddmparker___> we need to add some logic to close the panel if we follow an anchor
[08:16:31] <uGoMobi> was looking at the code why it doesn't work
[08:16:59] <toddmparker___> for popup?

[08:17:10] <toddmparker___> yeah, be good to figure that out
[08:17:39] <toddmparker___> we should fix this for popups and panels in the library
[08:18:16] <uGoMobi> in panel it works
[08:18:37] <toddmparker___> right, just doesn't auto-close
[08:19:06] <uGoMobi> you think we should add that logic to the framework?
[08:19:23] <uGoMobi> close panel when you click a link in the panel
[08:19:35] <uGoMobi> or just for our demos

[08:22:12] <toddmparker___> i think if it follows a link, it should close -- always
[08:32:55] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: downside is that is you have panel with a link to a popup in it, it won't work anymore
[08:33:22] <uGoMobi> well we could check data-rel attribute
[08:34:11] <uGoMobi> have to think if we need more exceptions
[08:36:35] <uGoMobi> when you link to another page or another panel to panel already closes itself
[08:37:08] <uGoMobi> so it's probably only for this deeplink feature which is not part of the framework
[08:44:12] <toddmparker___> technically, this is part of the the framework because it's just data-ajax=false
[08:44:23] <toddmparker___> so it seems that should work
[08:44:40] <toddmparker___> it does encourage using hashes which will mess up the nav tho
[08:45:01] <toddmparker___> in non-pushstate browsers
[08:46:17] <toddmparker___> guess we need to assume that people will copy what we do in the docs so we need to like this approach if we go there
[08:48:02] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: any idea why my link gets a btn class when opening? think that may be a bug where we assume it's a button instead of only applying that active class *if* a button
[08:56:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: yes that's a bug... will fix it

[12:01:55] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender Do you think we can modify the $.mobile.navigate method to take its parameters as hash? Like, ( url, data, {/* options */} ), or ( { url: url, data: data, otherOption: otherOption, ... } )
[12:01:56] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[12:03:52] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender The reason I ask is that I'm thinking that we could move a lot of the URL calculation into $.mobile.navigate and have it all in one place. Like: ( url, data, { allowDeepLink: true/false } ), and $.mobile.navigate would also take into account $.mobile.hashListeningEnabled, $.mobile.changePage.defaults.changeHash, etc ...
[12:03:53] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[12:09:50] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender For example we could move a lot of the url calculation code out of changePage and popup and dialog into this method, and we could make the parameters more flexible (which actually calls for having only one parameter - a hash): { back: true/false (false means forward), url: url, data: data } where the presence of the key "back" means we don't bother checking the url, but instead we either simply call $.mobile.back() or
[12:09:50] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[12:21:12] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender I think I'll move these thoughts to a more reliable medium :)
[12:21:13] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[12:33:52] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Nav-thoughts
[12:33:52] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[12:53:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker___ uGoMobi: saw some htaccess questions and deeplink questions either of you around?
[12:54:18] <arschmitz> sorry i was setting up the babys room earlier so i wasent paying attention
[12:54:47] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/pWOGiQ
[12:54:48] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14327bbc6 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: fixed a link in responsive grids
[13:00:48] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: hi. i think the issue was your original htaccess killed things locally
[13:01:02] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi changed it, but not it works locally and not up on the server
[13:01:09] <toddmparker___> that's about all i know
[13:01:16] <toddmparker___> _|Nix|_: you still around?
[13:01:41] <arschmitz> hmm owrked localy for me
[13:01:44] <toddmparker___> Just wanted to ask if you had time to re-look at the popup re-positioning issue on iOS6
[13:01:48] <arschmitz> thats a sever config issue
[13:02:15] <arschmitz> different versions and configs require different directives
[13:02:18] <toddmparker___> it opens, blinks away then re-positions pretty frequently so it looks glitchy
[13:02:40] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: i didn't test it myself
[13:02:53] <toddmparker___> maybe you guys have different server setups?
[13:02:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker___ im thinking i should talk to gnarf or ryanneufeld or some one from infra
[13:03:02] <toddmparker___> i use mamp 
[13:03:05] <arschmitz> im sure we do im on mac hes on windows right now
[13:03:08] <arschmitz> i use mamp too
[13:03:14] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: exactly, maybe you can try and work with 'em
[13:03:17] <arschmitz> i also have xamp i can test on windows
[13:03:41] <arschmitz> ill try to catch gnarf tonight hes normally around at late
[13:04:29] <arschmitz> also i saw something about the deeplinks in panels or popups and interfering with nav
[13:05:03] <arschmitz> if we want a bit more robust solution we can go back to the widget it will work in popups and panels and does not modify the hash
[13:05:22] <arschmitz> i just didnt think it was going to be needed hand not thought of panels or popups
[13:05:50] <arschmitz> its only like a ten line widget so its not a big deal 
[13:14:41] <agcolom> hello :-)
[13:15:10] <agcolom> quick question, should it be layout grid or grid layout?
[13:15:38] <agcolom> toddmparker___: 
[13:16:32] <agcolom> I used grid layout in the api doc, but now i'm thinking it should be layout grid... so not sure...
[13:17:59] <arschmitz> hi agcolom
[13:18:39] <arschmitz> thats not a widget or function its just a description
[13:18:46] <agcolom> yes
[13:19:31] <arschmitz> looks liek we currently use layout grids
[13:19:37] <arschmitz> so i would stick with that
[13:20:47] <agcolom> yes, that's what I was thinking as well...
[13:55:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am here now
[13:55:37] <arschmitz> hey
[13:55:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hey
[13:56:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: htaccess works local, but now on server
[13:56:03] <arschmitz> so i saw the htaccess wasent working for you local so you changed and now its a no go on the server?
[13:56:08] <arschmitz> ok
[13:56:18] <arschmitz> what are you running for a local server
[13:56:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes there was one line missing
[13:56:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that isnt normally needed it worked fine for me local 
[13:57:10] <arschmitz> but its very config and version dependant
[13:57:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: here html files were downloaded instead of opened in browser
[13:57:21] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:57:22] <arschmitz> yeah i saw that
[13:57:31] <arschmitz> what do you use for a local server
[13:57:33] <arschmitz> ?
[13:57:37] <uGoMobi> could have to do with mod_mime config
[13:57:42] <arschmitz> xamp or wamp
[13:57:46] <uGoMobi> very basic... xamp
[13:58:00] <arschmitz> ok i have xamp on my other laptop ill try on there
[13:58:11] <arschmitz> i know the way i had it worked on mamp and wamp
[13:58:21] <uGoMobi> well it works fine nw
[13:58:23] <uGoMobi> now*
[13:58:30] <arschmitz> but not on server i thought?
[13:58:46] <uGoMobi> not on jquerymobile.com/test
[13:59:05] <uGoMobi> but I think we need to ask gnarf 
[13:59:07] <arschmitz> right but toddmparker___ said that it was working before on jquerymobile.com/test
[13:59:21] <uGoMobi> no
[13:59:29] <arschmitz> yes im going to try and catch him tonight real real late is the best time to catch him
[13:59:30] <uGoMobi> we never really tested it
[13:59:38] <arschmitz> ok
[13:59:38] <uGoMobi> and latest build was broken
[13:59:50] <uGoMobi> but you could still browse /test/
[13:59:52] <arschmitz> latest build broke before that commit it was unrelated
[14:00:00] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[14:00:11] <uGoMobi> wasn't sure about that
[14:00:11] <arschmitz> i was watching the build when i commited to check for that
[14:00:31] <arschmitz> latest broke on previous commit and it was a memory timeout now anything to do with commits
[14:00:54] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[14:01:05] <arschmitz> all tests were green on phantom master
[14:01:33] <arschmitz> but regardless
[14:01:45] <uGoMobi> so i dont know if without the line i added (your version) it would work on the server
[14:01:48] <arschmitz> we need to try and find the combination of directives that will be the most universal
[14:01:52] <uGoMobi> we didnt have test case
[14:02:19] <arschmitz> ok
[14:02:59] <uGoMobi> and i thought that having the htaccess in the root could cause issues with the unit test html pages
[14:03:02] <uGoMobi> not sure
[14:03:20] <uGoMobi> but I placed in docs folder now
[14:03:32] <arschmitz> yeah either is ok for now at least
[14:03:48] <arschmitz> I know it didnt break tests because like i said i watched and all were green
[14:04:10] <arschmitz> if we use the include on the main index page it will have to go in root eventually
[14:04:47] <uGoMobi> right
[14:05:20] <uGoMobi> well i m not really specialized in these things
[14:05:52] <arschmitz> yeah im pretty good with this stuff but by no means an expert i administer 3 linux servers but nothing to the scale that we have for jquery lol
[14:06:21] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:06:35] <arschmitz> but i know gnarf we hung out a lot in korea so im going to try and catch him tonight to see what he says about all of it
[14:06:53] <uGoMobi> i can manage the basic things like redirects and config my xamp but thats about it
[14:07:04] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[14:07:08] <arschmitz> i sent him a message in skype already but it dosent look like hes around at the moment
[14:08:07] <arschmitz> i dont know anything about the config on the servers for jquery so need to check with him for sure i think
[14:08:15] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:08:59] <arschmitz> also hoping he knows what combo of directives will best cover our bases for people clonign and running on all different configs
[14:09:45] <arschmitz> iv never run into problems trying to do this before
[14:10:00] <uGoMobi> htaccess in only for apache right?
[14:10:04] <uGoMobi> is*
[14:10:05] <arschmitz> yes
[14:10:28] <arschmitz> you can also disable all htaccess directive from http.conf 
[14:10:40] <arschmitz> so who knows what they have setup there
[14:10:42] <uGoMobi> well most people use apache I suppose
[14:11:11] <arschmitz> if they are running php its almost guranteed to be apache or similar that accepts htaccess
[14:11:28] <uGoMobi> yeah so that will be fine
[14:12:11] <arschmitz> at worst we add a note to the read me about what we are doing so people know 
[14:12:27] <uGoMobi> yes good idea
[14:15:01] <arschmitz> stll need to check with gseguin and johnbender about concants for the zip but if we cant figgured out an accessible way to deal with the link and hiding the php include
[14:16:30] <arschmitz> we can place the php inside a display none div
[14:17:02] <arschmitz> and inside the panel include have a script tag that sets it to display block
[14:19:16] <uGoMobi> or maybe the other way around
[14:19:42] <uGoMobi> so it also works without JS
[14:20:52] <uGoMobi> the PHP included is not rendered if it's not working http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/buttons/index.html
[14:24:05] <uGoMobi> but sounds like a good solution
[14:30:56] <arschmitz> so about the deeplinking i think i saw something about issues with popups and panels
[14:30:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and nav concerns?
[14:30:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: previously i used a widget for this but i removed it. iv i put it back it will work for all of these situations
[14:31:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it didn't work with a link in a popup
[14:32:05] <uGoMobi> in a panel it works but we should close the panel if I link is followed
[14:32:39] <uGoMobi> maybe the best approach there is to do this only if data-ajax="false"
[14:32:51] <arschmitz> yeah makes sense
[14:33:11] <arschmitz> for popups i can make it work but would need to go back to widget approach
[14:33:32] <arschmitz> also i think _|Nix|_: was concerned about manipulating the hash in non pushstatebrowsers
[14:34:04] <arschmitz> either way not a big deal its like a ten line widget and you just use data-deeplink=
[14:34:04] <arschmitz> true
[14:34:12] <arschmitz> instead of data-ajax="false"
[14:36:14] <arschmitz> also the widget sets data-ajax="false" so your data-ajax=false approach for panels would still work
[14:36:38] <uGoMobi> ok great
[14:44:04] <johnbender> arschmitz: we can chat tomorrow first thing if you want
[14:44:18] <johnbender> I have to go over some stuff for _|Nix|_ too so I'll be in JQM mode
[14:50:22] <arschmitz> jihnbender awesome
[14:50:38] <arschmitz> johnbender^^^ lol

[15:39:06] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14d94deb1 15toddparker: Demos: Nav panel visual cleanup, trying a slightly offset top
[15:39:13] <toddmparker___> hey all
[15:39:24] <arschmitz> hey toddmparker___
[15:39:25] <toddmparker___> so nice that the panel anchor links are working
[15:39:39] <arschmitz> yeah
[15:39:58] <arschmitz> we need to decide if we want to use the widget or not for deeplinks though
[15:40:07] <toddmparker___> right
[15:40:31] <arschmitz> just so that we use the right markup and dont have to go back and change it
[15:40:38] <toddmparker___> if someone follows an anchor link now, they get #foo in the url
[15:40:44] <arschmitz> right
[15:40:50] <arschmitz> with the widget it squashes that
[15:40:51] <toddmparker___> if they then copy and paste that for a deep link, it won't work
[15:40:57] <arschmitz> yup
[15:41:13] <toddmparker___> so i wonder if we should be using the query param on all links 
[15:41:31] <toddmparker___> but i dunno what nav would do if you link to the same page
[15:41:43] <arschmitz> im not positive either
[15:42:11] <arschmitz> i can try it
[15:42:41] <toddmparker___> beginning to wonder if we should even try to hide the URL bar in the docs
[15:43:01] <toddmparker___> the iOS reader causes the chrome to hang over the page for a long time on most every page
[15:43:14] <arschmitz> yeah 
[15:43:24] <toddmparker___> i think that might be a config option
[15:43:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/1b242789406d8aeebc9d24cd363b8909bb2dd9f3
[15:43:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that commit broke the disabled styling for textinputs
[15:44:10] <uGoMobi> see http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/forms/form-disabled.html
[15:44:15] <arschmitz> im not even sure why the second part of that is in there
[15:44:35] <arschmitz> that should not have been part of that commit
[15:44:47] <arschmitz> only the change to fixedtoolbars should have been
[15:44:59] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker___ 
[15:45:06] <toddmparker___> hey uGoMobi 
[15:45:52] <toddmparker___> just tested the panel close thing on iOS6 and half the time, it jumps and closes correctly, half if jumps > closes and jumps back up to top
[15:46:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was working on the problem with calling enabled and disabled prior to that and must have accidently made that change 
[15:46:10] <toddmparker___> man, it's hard to style some stuff
[15:46:26] <toddmparker___> like the listview filter is rough, at least for me
[15:47:35] <toddmparker___> we really need to work on adding classes that make it easier to get to stuff
[15:47:54] <uGoMobi> very true
[15:48:10] <toddmparker___> or having  section per widget showing the selectors to get to various things
[15:50:32] <toddmparker___> huh, i added some top margin to the panels and i see it local but not on /test/
[15:51:19] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: prefixed classes and id's are tagged for widget review for 1.4
[15:51:33] <uGoMobi> latest isn't updated
[15:51:48] <toddmparker___> yeah. it'll be good to try and customize each element and see if it's easy to target 'em well
[15:51:54] <toddmparker___> ah, ok.
[15:52:08] <toddmparker___> is the server jammed up? hasn't happened in a while
[15:52:32] <uGoMobi> and maybe use less classes and more CSS3 selectors
[15:52:50] <uGoMobi> makes it easier to override
[15:53:30] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15toddparker pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/3SqQFg
[15:53:30] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14842c344 15toddparker: Demos: Updated listview link to point to the new page
[15:53:36] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: hopefully
[15:53:47] <toddmparker___> but having good structural classes is helpful
[15:54:03] <toddmparker___> we inject the search filter input and the container for it
[15:54:45] <toddmparker___> but the container doesn't have a structural class, only generic theme classes so it's trickier to target. you can with some context probably but...
[15:54:58] <toddmparker___> sure you can do a better job than me on that :)
[15:55:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: listview filter isnt even a widget
[15:55:33] <arschmitz> its an amalgum lol i could easily make it toss a class in for you for now for targeting
[15:56:16] <uGoMobi> yes the wrapper should have a structural class and the class set on the original element
[15:58:12] <arschmitz> thats a super quick easy change i can take care of that if you want
[15:58:30] <arschmitz> just what do we want for a class and a prefix?
[15:59:12] <uGoMobi> are you talking about listview filter?
[15:59:55] <arschmitz> yes
[16:01:01] <toddmparker___> yeah
[16:01:15] <toddmparker___> ui-listview-filter
[16:01:18] <toddmparker___> or something
[16:01:25] <uGoMobi> I think it should get class .ui-listview-filter-[originalClass] or something
[16:01:46] <toddmparker___> carrying classes up with a prefix is cool too
[16:01:50] <uGoMobi> ui-listview-filter already exists
[16:01:56] <toddmparker___> hmm
[16:02:04] <toddmparker___> maybe i'm smoking crack then
[16:02:11] <uGoMobi> but where do we add it to
[16:02:13] <arschmitz> ok heres thing with prefixed classes
[16:02:18] <toddmparker___> i'll need to look at it
[16:02:23] <arschmitz> is an element can have like ten classes if people want
[16:02:30] <toddmparker___> be back in a a bit, bedtime
[16:02:45] <arschmitz> normally you prefix the id for stuff like that
[16:03:03] <arschmitz> ok toddmparker___ ill be here
[16:03:10] <uGoMobi> <form class="ui-listview-filter ui-bar-c ui-listview-filter-inset" role="search">.....</form>
[16:03:24] <uGoMobi> we already add a class to the filter wrapper
[16:06:24] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I think I saw the issue with the links in the panel on iOS too but after a refresh I couldn't reproduce anymore... maybe has to with cache
[16:07:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: should we add "back to top" links to the sections where you can jump to?
[16:07:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think so
[16:07:42] <arschmitz> i have examples in my example page of doing back to top
[16:08:08] <arschmitz> but i really think we need to make a decision on if we are going to use the widget or not
[16:08:35] <arschmitz> because the markup for the links is different if we use it 
[16:10:05] <uGoMobi> back to top could just be href="#" with a scrollTop function in the JS
[16:10:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it does scroll top already
[16:10:37] <uGoMobi> what does?
[16:10:37] <arschmitz> but the issue is with modifying the hash and using in popups
[16:10:44] <arschmitz> the deeplinking
[16:10:48] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[16:11:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i need to do some looking into doing it a little different so that bookmarks will work 
[16:12:07] <toddmparker___> I think if we add these anchor a back to top link might be nice. maybe floated right next to the view source
[16:12:31] <uGoMobi> I think it's nice to have "scroll to top" links in same style as "jump to section" but aligned right
[16:12:42] <uGoMobi> yes
[16:12:45] <toddmparker___> but i agree that we need to make sure we're 100% on the syntax because we'll need to live with it for a long while
[16:12:47] <uGoMobi> and icon right
[16:12:52] <arschmitz> yeah i like uGoMobi's idea i think
[16:12:53] <uGoMobi> arrow-u
[16:13:05] <toddmparker___> yeah, think we're in agreement with the link
[16:13:14] <uGoMobi> now the script
[16:13:24] <toddmparker___> righ...dum, dum DUM
[16:13:27] <arschmitz> give me a few minutes with the script to try something
[16:13:32] <uGoMobi> cool
[16:13:41] <arschmitz> i want to see if i can make bookmarks work better
[16:13:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will revert that change you made by accident to textinput
[16:14:00] <toddmparker___> the ideal thing obviously would be to have a "proper" url like foo.html#bar
[16:14:16] <toddmparker___> but that's maybe a pipe dream
[16:14:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thank you
[16:14:45] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: yeah for right now that would be pretty tough
[16:15:01] <toddmparker___> but it seems that nav could look at the hash and see if #bar is a page, if not anchor down
[16:15:23] <toddmparker___> at least for deep links
[16:15:31] <toddmparker___> but it's really messy, i know
[16:16:20] <toddmparker___> but some form of anchor solution is really needed
[16:16:27] <toddmparker___> hard to do longer pages
[16:16:38] <toddmparker___> ok, gone now

[16:23:40] <arschmitz> ok so i could easily make bookmarks work when pushstate is supported
[16:24:28] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: mind looking at a better active state for my hacked demo listviews?
[16:24:45] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: sure np
[16:25:12] <toddmparker___> open to any ideas
[16:32:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: the margin top on the panels trigger a vertical scrollbar
[16:32:50] <uGoMobi> panels have height 100%
[16:36:48] <arschmitz> ok working on an extension to make deeplinks just work
[16:36:58] <arschmitz> extending change page
[16:40:41] <uGoMobi> found a workaround
[16:46:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for what?
[16:47:00] <uGoMobi> oh the panels
[16:47:03] <arschmitz> ok
[16:47:20] <arschmitz> iv got something good cooking for deeplinks too lol
[17:03:52] <toddmparker___> hey-o
[17:04:14] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: ah, i'll change that margin
[17:04:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: nah not needed
[17:04:40] <toddmparker___> ?
[17:04:59] <uGoMobi> fixed it by using bottom 0 and override min-height 100% by auto
[17:05:42] <uGoMobi> was thinking of maybe change that in the framework panel css
[17:06:16] <uGoMobi> but have test a bit more first
[17:06:25] <uGoMobi> s/have/have to/
[17:06:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: so its looking like i might be able to bake deeplinking right into hash
[17:06:49] <arschmitz> into nav i mean
[17:07:36] <arschmitz> i need to talk to johnbender of course though
[17:12:41] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: yeah?
[17:13:02] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: thanks man.
[17:13:15] <toddmparker___> do you guys like the slight offset anyway? just trying things
[17:14:19] <arschmitz> toddmparker___ sorry been only half paying attention working on deeplinking like offset on what?
[17:15:42] <arschmitz> awesome so i can totally make this work i think
[17:16:01] <arschmitz> bookmarks inital load in a page you name it all just work baked right in
[17:16:29] <arschmitz> or it can work stand alone binding to pagebeforechange
[17:29:42] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: great to hear!
[17:29:50] <toddmparker___> i think an extension might be ideal
[17:30:57] <toddmparker___> offset = the panels are shifted down a few pix instead of being at the very top
[17:32:57] <arschmitz> ok is it on master
[17:33:01] <arschmitz> ?
[17:33:51] <arschmitz> ok i see
[17:33:54] <arschmitz> i like the offset

[17:40:49] <uGoMobi> just see if you like the changes
[17:41:49] <uGoMobi> I used swatch D instead of C for the buttonsand a light blue active style
[17:42:53] <uGoMobi> maybe we need a bit more contrast between dividers and buttons
[17:44:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: where?
[17:44:54] <arschmitz> oh nevermind i see it 
[17:45:00] <arschmitz> i like the active
[17:45:04] <uGoMobi> demos index page and left nav menu
[17:45:09] <arschmitz> but i do think some contrast could hep
[17:45:14] <uGoMobi> but depends on screen
[17:45:16] <arschmitz> with dividers
[17:48:48] <Changsuk> Hi, All. I think you are so busy now.

[18:27:24] <toddmparker___> was heads down fixing up the top level demo pages
[18:27:31] <arschmitz> sweet
[18:27:43] <arschmitz> have you added deeplinks to any pages besides buttons?
[18:27:52] <toddmparker___> not yet
[18:27:54] <arschmitz> ok
[18:28:06] <toddmparker___> i'm hoping we can automate generating that menu :)
[18:28:18] <arschmitz> that would be sweet
[18:28:59] <arschmitz> right now i have deeplinks working with no special handeling
[18:29:28] <arschmitz> johnbender is already plaing time to go over the build with me tomorrow so im going to talk to him about this too
[18:29:44] <arschmitz> make sure there are not any bad side effects im not seeing
[18:30:02] <arschmitz> i need to come up with a convention for scroll to top though
[18:30:54] <arschmitz> i dont want to do just # because we use that a lot for closing popups and dialogs and stuff
[18:31:40] <arschmitz> im thinking like #top toddmparker___: any thoughts on that

[18:32:37] <toddmparker___> tho that link really won't work w/o js
[18:32:52] <toddmparker___> every page can't have an id of top
[18:33:17] <arschmitz> yeah there is no real way to do it with out js
[18:33:40] <arschmitz> normally the way its done with out js is set an id on body or something at the very top and use that
[18:33:42] <uGoMobi> ok that's it for me for today
[18:33:49] <uGoMobi> good night guys
[18:34:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sleep well see you in the morning
[18:34:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker___ though i guess we could set an id on body on every page without harm
[18:34:29] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: thanks for all your help
[18:34:34] <arschmitz> since that is not pulled in with ajax
[18:34:40] <toddmparker___> i have some more change queued up
[18:34:52] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: sure
[18:35:02] <arschmitz> then that will work with out js
[18:36:00] <toddmparker___> cool
[18:36:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker___ cant belive i didnt think of this idea before for deeplinks
[18:36:36] <arschmitz> its so easy
[18:40:04] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: https://gist.github.com/4583274 this is the whole thing it either goes in a pagebeforechange handler or in changepage itself
[19:11:37] <toddmparker___> looking...
[19:12:07] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: yeah, so simple
[19:12:14] <toddmparker___> nice
[19:13:14] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: yeah 
[19:13:22] <arschmitz> im thinking we can make this work
[19:13:46] <arschmitz> depending on what johnbender says tomorrow we might even be able to make this part of the library "fingers crossed" lol

[19:31:20] <arschmitz> yup
[19:33:43] <arschmitz> i was going to try and work on porting stuff in today but have been caught up on deeplinking
[19:46:03] <toddmparker___> it's super important
[19:46:22] <toddmparker___> gave me time to work thru the design a bit anyway
[19:48:14] <arschmitz> yeah

[19:55:39] <ryanneufeld> though I'm pretty sure all the jq servers are nginx
[19:56:30] <toddmparker___> great...hope arschmitz is still here. he was a minute ago
[19:56:35] <arschmitz> yup im here
[19:57:02] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker___: didn't I set you up with ZNC?
[19:57:30] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: he has it lol 
[19:58:13] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: what was it that you needed?
[19:58:25] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: im not very familier with nginx but im sure there must be a way to do this
[19:58:32] <arschmitz> we want to pare php in html
[19:58:35] <arschmitz> parse
[19:58:41] <toddmparker___> i use that at work, here at home, i'm on irccloud. i'm a mess.
[19:59:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: if you set them all up with znc everythign will stay in synce with only one name
[20:00:29] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker___: ^^ that
[20:00:44] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: so you want php files to be parsed?
[20:01:02] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: we want to parse php in an html file
[20:01:13] <ryanneufeld> wut
[20:01:24] <arschmitz> so we can keep .html extension but parse php in it
[20:01:31] <arschmitz> its easy with htaccess
[20:01:50] <ryanneufeld> depends on how you want to do it
[20:02:01] <ryanneufeld> you can easily rewrite .html to .php
[20:02:07] <ryanneufeld> which would make more sense
[20:02:12] <arschmitz> ok
[20:02:25] <ryanneufeld> like, a year from now
[20:02:30] <ryanneufeld> if you're not around
[20:02:35] <arschmitz> ok
[20:02:50] <ryanneufeld> what server is this on?
[20:02:53] <arschmitz> we just want to be able to use php includes in an html file for consistancy
[20:03:07] <arschmitz> jquerymobile.com where ever that is
[20:03:27] <arschmitz> its for our deos

[20:04:49] <ryanneufeld> thats on one of the old end of life servers
[20:05:32] <arschmitz> we have a nav menu we want to include on every page
[20:05:55] <arschmitz> so we wanted to use a php include to do it so we wouldnt have to maintain on every page
[20:06:24] <toddmparker___> hate to do this, but i gotta hop off
[20:06:25] <arschmitz> but we didnt want to switch to use .php extension on everything
[20:06:28] <toddmparker___> g'night!
[20:06:30] <ryanneufeld> night
[20:06:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker
[20:06:37] <arschmitz> good night
[20:07:21] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: does that make sense what we want to do?
[20:07:29] <ryanneufeld> totally
[20:07:33] <arschmitz> ok
[20:07:53] <ryanneufeld> but my pedantic brain tells me it's sill to have html parsed by php :p
[20:07:57] <ryanneufeld> lemme see what I can do
[20:07:59] <ryanneufeld> I have an idea
[20:08:07] <arschmitz> ok
[20:09:19] <arschmitz> its not for our normail jquerymobile.com just so you know it will be http://jquerymobile.com/test/index.html
[20:09:26] <arschmitz> and everythign under that
[20:09:37] <ryanneufeld> just under /test/
[20:09:39] <ryanneufeld> gotcha
[20:09:47] <arschmitz> well and any other build of our docs
[20:09:57] <ryanneufeld> okay
[20:10:38] <arschmitz> thats why my first thought was just throw an .htaccess in the root of the docs and then its automaticlly there for every buidl
[20:10:48] <arschmitz> but of course thats only apache not nginx
[20:11:10] <arschmitz> we will still probably include one for appache since most people that build local will be on apache
[20:11:12] <ryanneufeld> lucky for you, eol2 (where this is hosted) is apache
[20:11:27] <arschmitz> cool
[20:12:06] <arschmitz> so since our htaccess didnt work im guessing that some http.conf directive is not allowing it ?
[20:13:13] <ryanneufeld> well the test directory doesn't exist
[20:13:15] <ryanneufeld> test -> /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/jQuery Mobile Latest/workspace/compiled/demos/
[20:13:37] <arschmitz> ok
[20:13:54] <ryanneufeld> at least it seems that way
[20:14:45] <ryanneufeld> it appears I may have been looking in the wrong place
[20:15:15] <arschmitz> what we tried right now is this...https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/docs
[20:16:08] <ryanneufeld> I don't know how that is working
[20:16:12] <ryanneufeld> because what I'm looking at
[20:16:23] <ryanneufeld> the /test does not exist
[20:16:31] <arschmitz> weird lol
[20:16:47] <arschmitz> test is the build of master
[20:17:27] <ryanneufeld>         ProxyPass /test http://builder.jquerymobile.com/test
[20:17:31] <ryanneufeld> HA HA
[20:17:35] <ryanneufeld> *AH HA
[20:17:37] <ryanneufeld> that's why
[20:18:21] <ryanneufeld> and the reason that your htaccess didn't work is because that machine is nginx
[20:18:53] <arschmitz> ok lol makes sense
[20:21:31] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: could we do something like this?
[20:21:32] <arschmitz>  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8644783/html-files-as-php-in-nginx
[20:23:03] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: I don't know anything about nginx
[20:23:08] <arschmitz> oh ok
[20:23:12] <arschmitz> neither do i lol
[20:23:12] <ryanneufeld> I'm googling
[20:23:18] <arschmitz> lol thats what i did
[20:23:20] <ryanneufeld> and reading the puppet manifests
[20:23:33] <ryanneufeld> getting an idea what gnarf did when they were set up
[20:23:41] <arschmitz> ok
[20:24:24] <arschmitz> gnarf must be busy lately i can never seem to catch him
[20:31:36] <ryanneufeld> yeah, he's doing stuff
[20:31:43] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying something now
[20:31:48] <ryanneufeld> we'll see if I break it all
[20:32:14] <ryanneufeld> okay
[20:32:20] <arschmitz> lol ok
[20:32:31] <ryanneufeld> nothing is broken it seems
[20:32:38] <ryanneufeld> but nginx doesn't want to restart
[20:32:39] <ryanneufeld> ...
[20:33:01] <arschmitz> hmmmm
[20:34:18] <arschmitz> yeah test is down now but if nginx isnt running im sure that would be why!
[20:37:53] <ryanneufeld> how about now?
[20:38:25] <arschmitz> access denied
[20:38:29] <ryanneufeld> fuck
[20:39:04] <arschmitz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8644783/html-files-as-php-in-nginx
[20:39:15] <arschmitz> second answer down shows the cause for that
[20:39:55] <ryanneufeld> ahhh
[20:39:58] <ryanneufeld> good catch
[20:42:54] <ryanneufeld> and we're back
[20:43:05] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: do you have a page w/ php in it that we can test?
[20:44:37] <arschmitz> im not sure someone else was trying to set it up let me take a quick look to see what they did if not ill make one and commit it real quick
