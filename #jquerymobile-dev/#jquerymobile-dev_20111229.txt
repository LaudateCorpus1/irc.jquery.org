[08:26:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> garann: Corrected fix for #3262 so it doesn't prevent buttons filling available space
[08:45:26] <Wilto>  Alright jQuery Mobilers: sound off. Who’s around today?
[08:54:47] <imjoshdean> yo?
[08:57:05] <Wilto> ’Sup.
[08:58:28] <gseguin> What up Wilto
[08:58:56] <Wilto> Just seeing who’s floating around. Looks like we’re holdin’ it down today.
[08:59:05] <gseguin> looks like we're still the only ones hanging around here
[08:59:10] <gseguin> yep
[08:59:22] <Wilto> I’m—thankfully—taking a break from Android transitions today, since they’re looking pretty damn fair now.
[08:59:52] <Wilto> I think I’m just gonna work my way through pull requests for a while, then assorted issues. What’re you on? And imjoshdean, are you available for jQuery Mobilin’?
[09:00:30] <gseguin> I'm trying to figure out the custom build thing
[09:00:46] <imjoshdean> Wilto: at this very second, no. sorry. realized you're probably looking for something immediate
[09:00:55] <imjoshdean> work has me occupiedo
[09:01:03] <gseguin> I've been looking around for something I could re-use but nada
[09:01:03] <Wilto> Oh, no, still just talkin’ general game-plan.
[09:02:05] <imjoshdean> Wilto: i can throw in my two bits here and there. sure.
[09:13:50] <Wilto> Whatup, johnbender.
[09:21:51] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3352
[09:21:55] <Wilto> …?
[09:21:57] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3352
[09:22:05] <Wilto> What the hell, socialhapy.
[09:23:10] <Wilto> Anyway: anyone see any reason why the above could be suspect? Seems fine to me.
[09:23:51] <gseguin> seems fine to me too
[09:24:06] <Wilto> Cool, cool. I just get uneasy when things are… Easy.
[09:24:25] <gseguin> that's the side effect of working on Android issues
[09:24:46] <Wilto> Post-Android Stress Disorder.
[09:25:29] <johnbender> Wilto: I think removing the down class doesn't matter
[09:25:50] <johnbender> as far as that pr is concerned

[09:26:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3352 from jakeboone02/issue-3350 - Mat Marquis
[09:26:01] <johnbender> when the phones scroll they freeze the render in a lot of cases
[09:26:10] <johnbender> kin would know better than I
[09:26:19] <gseguin> hey johnbender! How goes it?
[09:26:43] <Wilto> Yeah. I’m thinking, if it works on the phone in question, that’s cool. If not, eh, no change.
[09:26:52] <Wilto> I know it’s not gonna do anything on Android, but not a lot we can do about that.
[09:26:55] <johnbender> gseguin: really well yourself?
[09:27:14] <gseguin> good good, enjoying your time off?
[09:27:16] <johnbender> are there any huge fires to put out?
[09:27:17] <johnbender> yah
[09:27:18] <johnbender> I am
[09:27:25] <johnbender> I've been playing video games like non stop
[09:27:34] <johnbender> jury is still out if that's a good thing or not
[09:27:35] <gseguin> heh
[09:27:46] <johnbender> going on a hike today though
[09:27:46] <gseguin> no fire here
[09:27:54] <Wilto> ’Tis the season. Stay away from Skyrim.
[09:27:58] <gseguin> oh good
[09:28:07] <johnbender> Wilto: playing SWTOR
[09:28:13] <johnbender> similarly bad
[09:28:26] <johnbender> where bad ~= addictive
[09:28:46] <Wilto> Exactly.
[09:29:16] <Wilto> Skyward Sword is also great, but everyone here probably knew I was gonna say that.
[09:29:35] <johnbender> It's to the point where I"m thinking about building a new rig just to play
[09:29:39] <johnbender> well
[09:29:47] <johnbender> that and I really want a 2560 screen :/
[09:31:08] <gseguin> they're not cheap
[09:32:07] <johnbender> nope
[09:32:10] <johnbender> but I want one
[09:32:25] <johnbender> the dell 30 inch looks promising :)
[09:32:28] <johnbender> holy crap
[09:32:36] <johnbender> with a tiling window manager it will be amazing
[09:32:54] <johnbender> I'll have emacs spanning the top half split twice
[09:33:11] <gseguin> NERD ALERT!
[09:33:11] <johnbender> and 2 terminals on the bottom
[09:33:17] <johnbender> seriously lol
[09:33:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 3 new commits to fade-out-in-transition: http://git.io/XFMMnQ
[09:33:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] for now, removed any difference between framework transition defaults and the docs. We might want to bring this back and recommend it though - I'm not sure how easy it'll be to bring it in standard with the ability to configure. - scottjehl
[09:33:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] default transition type goes to fade - scottjehl
[09:33:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] an attempt at simplification. not there yet... - scottjehl
[09:34:14] <Wilto> Man. I thought I was bad for having my terminal window gradually creep up to occupy like 80% of my screen.
[09:37:59] <Wilto> Granted, I use terminal with all the grace of someone hammering in nails with the back of a pneumatic nail gun. There is much I can learn.
[09:42:11] <gseguin> johnbender: have you given some thoughts on how to build that download builder service?
[09:43:01] <gseguin> Man! I think that ticked him off...

[13:27:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] First stab at more consistent focus classes on form elements, using .ui-focus. Links will still contain outline property. - zachleat

[13:27:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Per @toddparker's comment, added boxshadow to link buttons. Also changed focus class on sliders to add to the handle, while excluding the toggle switch. - zachleat

[14:26:01] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: First stab at more consistent focus classes on form elements, using .ui-focus. Links will still contain outline property.
[14:26:01] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Nerf, you guys use tabs.
[14:26:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Per @toddparker's comment, added boxshadow to link buttons. Also changed focus class on sliders to add to the handle, while excluding the toggle switch.
[14:26:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Fix for browsers with JavaScript but without box-shadow enabled. outline: 0; outline-width: 2px; doesn't work, requires an outline-style to be set.
[14:26:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: This might be a little overzealous, but I think the outline around the entire flip switch looks better than the clipped handle outline.
