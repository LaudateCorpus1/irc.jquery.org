[04:19:16] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jakeboone02: Small grammar correction in docs
[05:03:29] <jzaefferer> just added the IRC commit hook to jquery-mobile, should now get links to commits in here
[05:05:22] <aaronmcadam> nice I'm using git dude to keep up
[05:24:12] <jzaefferer> we've got that in place for jquery, jquery-ui and qunit, should be useful here as well
[07:08:31] <Wilto> Gentlemen.
[07:10:17] <aaronmcadam> Wilto, etc congrats on rc2 :)
[07:25:29] <toddparker> thanks aaronmcadam
[07:25:35] <aaronmcadam> :)
[07:25:48] <aaronmcadam> glad the issue I raised got mentioned in the blog post :D
[07:25:55] <aaronmcadam> i feel special lol
[07:26:05] <toddparker> eddiemonge or john bender - can we add the structure css files to the download zip?
[07:26:18] <toddparker> heh…which one was that?
[07:26:33] <aaronmcadam> the truncation on the collapsible header
[07:26:34] <aaronmcadam> :D
[07:26:41] <toddparker> ah, right
[07:27:07] <aaronmcadam> issues are still flooding in, good to see
[07:27:18] <aaronmcadam> well, least people are reporting
[08:10:10] <toddparker> heh, yeah
[08:33:56] <toddparker> hey all - we have the TR stuff ready to stage
[08:34:37] <toddparker> *** If you just got the access email - don't mention URLs or any other confidential info here, this is a public channel ***
[08:35:29] <Wilto> I STILL CAN’T BELIEVE WE BUILT IT WITH ADOBE MUSE WAIT OH NO WRONG WINDOW
[08:37:30] <toddparker> it's Air + Silverlight with some Java for good measure
[08:38:01] <eddiemonge>  did you want t-test password protected right now?
[08:41:45] <toddparker> i think dan said it needed to be open for the git sync
[08:41:46] <toddparker> it's ok
[08:41:53] <toddparker> keep it on the down low tho
[08:42:13] <toddparker> so eddiemonge did you see my Q about having a shortcut to the latest STABLE css and js?
[08:42:21] <toddparker> so instead of this:
[08:42:22] <toddparker> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0rc2/jquery.mobile-1.0rc2.min.js
[08:42:26] <toddparker> i could use
[08:43:06] <toddparker> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/stable/jquery.mobile.min.js
[08:43:11] <toddparker> or something like that
[08:43:22] <toddparker> so i don' tneed to run around updating versions
[08:44:02] <toddparker> tho that might be confusing
[08:44:06] <toddparker> thoughts?
[08:44:39] * kinblas just missed what toddparker was asking about
[08:45:17] <eddiemonge> its possible but people would need to be aware that if they use that, their site could break with updates
[08:45:42] <toddparker> yeah
[08:45:43] <toddparker> nevermind
[08:45:48] <toddparker> just more stuff to update
[08:45:50] <aaronmcadam> ah toddparker you mean have a link to the latest stable like we have a reference to the latest git?
[08:45:52] <toddparker> ;)
[08:46:05] <toddparker> yeah aaronmcadam
[08:46:15] <eddiemonge> im updating the cdn index btw
[08:46:24] <aaronmcadam> nice, I'd use that, i was using test and then the css broke because of the refactor of that
[08:46:42] <toddparker> so this might still be useful?
[08:47:05] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: what were you using?
[08:47:09] <toddparker> eddie - the stable link could just resolve to the current version number on the can so it's more of a re-direct so the version is clear
[08:47:13] <aaronmcadam> "/test/"
[08:47:30] <toddparker> yeah, using test/latest is very risky
[08:47:34] <aaronmcadam> yeah I wouldn't deploy to a "/stable", never a good idea to deploy code that could change
[08:47:48] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah I just like to make sure I'm not fixing bugs that have already been fixed
[08:49:04] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: you do know about the cdn /mobile/latest right?
[08:49:12] <aaronmcadam> oh yes eddiemonge
[08:49:13] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: im still curious how your css broke though
[08:49:24] <aaronmcadam> but I use test to stay on the edge
[08:49:31] <aaronmcadam> the urls changed eddiemonge
[08:49:55] <eddiemonge> thats why you should use the cdn. it has the latest edge and the url doesnt change
[08:50:20] <aaronmcadam> right cool, does it update every day?
[08:50:30] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: it updates every push
[08:50:35] <aaronmcadam> ah nice one
[08:51:29] <aaronmcadam> I'll go back to using /latest then so :)
[08:51:42] <eddiemonge> code.jquery.com/mobile/latest
[08:52:10] <aaronmcadam> also, with the css refactor - structure vs theme, I'm going to have to see what I was inheriting from each
[08:52:33] <toddparker> structure is everything except theme.css
[08:52:35] <aaronmcadam> yep eddiemonge, I've just got it commented out in my source, thanks tho :)
[08:52:44] <toddparker> eddiemonge: do you have access to the TR repo
[08:52:49] <aaronmcadam> so I'll need structure and probably theme too
[08:53:29] <eddiemonge> toddparker: on git? no
[08:53:37] <toddparker> no?
[08:53:38] <toddparker> ok
[08:54:07] <toddparker> just wondering how to deal with the different folders between TR live and dev
[08:54:13] <toddparker> in the code
[08:54:34] <toddparker> johnbender: you around?
[08:54:57] <eddiemonge> toddparker: do you have admin on it?
[08:56:57] <toddparker> admin?
[08:58:03] <johnbender> toddparker: I am indeed
[08:58:25] <johnbender> stepped away for a second
[08:58:49] <eddiemonge> admin access to the repo
[09:02:11] <toddparker> don't think so
[09:02:18] <toddparker> i have commit access, not admin
[09:02:24] <toddparker> eddiemonge ^^
[09:05:09] <eddiemonge> toddparker: what are you asking about folders?
[09:09:11] <eddiemonge> i wish i did have access so i could make some changes to the files
[09:31:45] <johnbender> eddiemonge: we don't retain older previously releases for use do we?
[09:33:08] <eddiemonge> what you mean?
[09:35:04] <johnbender> eddiemonge: right now I can link to rc2 but I was wondering if I could post a public link to rc1 or b2
[09:35:30] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'm asking some folks to test a bug with *older* versions of the library to see if it's still and issue for them
[09:35:39] <johnbender> since I don't have a windows phone :(
[09:36:09] <eddiemonge> you mean like a list of the older releases? like on the cdn index?
[09:36:27] <johnbender> indeed!
[09:36:34] <johnbender> looking now
[09:36:56] <johnbender> eddiemonge: thanks
[09:38:45] <johnbender> sigh
[09:38:46] <johnbender> http://encosia.com/why-phonegap-1-1-0-broke-jquery-mobiles-back-button/
[09:40:35] <toddparker> johnbender: the older release are easy to link to
[09:40:43] <toddparker> just edit the url for the demos
[09:40:53] <toddparker> or edit the urls for the js and css links
[09:40:59] <toddparker> they are still all up on the cdn
[09:41:26] <toddparker> johnbender:  re: the phonegapgap back button, is there something we should do on our end? wish we saw this before yesterday
[09:44:18] <eddiemonge> why would they do that?

[09:45:24] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #2757 from jakeboone02/ios-web-app-demo - Todd Parker
[09:45:57] <johnbender> haha
[09:46:02] <johnbender> did someone add those hooks to the bot?
[09:46:20] <johnbender> toddparker: no it's "fixed"
[09:46:35] <johnbender> eddiemonge: well I think one thing is they want people to be able to back out of the application on android
[09:46:51] <johnbender> eddiemonge: where as normally it would just stop at the last history entry in the focused web view
[09:47:05] <johnbender> toddparker: all we can do is tell people to use the workaround
[09:47:52] <johnbender> eddiemonge: that's semi informed by my rooting around looking for answer's to our uiwebview issue
[09:47:55] <eddiemonge> theres an easier fix for that instead of hijacking it. they should have just checked the length of it, see its the last one the issue the close
[09:48:18] <johnbender> eddiemonge: where would you put that check?
[09:48:55] <johnbender> toddparker: kinblas: I'm donwloading windows to install on my old lenovo so I can work on the windows phone 7 bug
[09:49:07] <johnbender> stuck at home today because the office internet is borked
[09:49:42] <kinblas> johnbender: I thought you had a vm?
[09:49:46] <eddiemonge> johnbender: same place that they are doing the hijacking.
[09:50:05] <kinblas> mornin' tbenzige
[09:51:34] <johnbender> eddiemonge: you just said that was "instead of hijacking"
[09:51:51] <johnbender> do you mean the same spot in the JS?
[09:51:59] <eddiemonge> yeah
[09:52:05] <johnbender> the hijacking takes place on load
[09:52:11] <johnbender> so I don't see how that would be triggered by the back button
[09:52:35] <johnbender> or at least that's how I understood it when I was perusing the code
[09:52:57] <johnbender> kinblas: he left the room just to avoid your good morning
[09:53:14] <kinblas> heh
[09:53:27] <toddparker> hey guys
[09:53:31] <toddparker> sorry i keep stepping out
[09:53:46] * johnbender throws a tomato at toddparker 
[09:53:51] <johnbender> seriously guy
[09:54:11] <toddparker> so if phone gap is "fixed" do we need to do anything to clue people in? tweet a link to that article? or to and issue?
[09:54:31] <toddparker> tbenzige: what's your Skype name?
[09:54:42] <johnbender> toddparker: tweeting might be good
[09:55:04] <toddparker> johnbender: to that article?
[09:55:09] <toddparker> brb
[09:59:41] <johnbender> toddparker: no
[09:59:51] <johnbender> I think there's a google groups post
[10:01:03] <johnbender> toddparker: I think they monkneypatch it for a reason and that fix he proposes removes it entirely
[10:01:32] <johnbender> so I would support that
[10:02:37] <johnbender> toddparker: wouldn't

[10:28:27] <jzaefferer> johnbender: dunno, probably not
[10:28:34] <jzaefferer> do you have some jenkins docs for me? :-)
[10:37:10] <johnbender> jzaefferer: arg I don't
[10:37:20] <johnbender> but whilst I'm installing windows I will get you some
[10:37:50] <jzaefferer> cool
[10:38:38] <johnbender> jzaefferer: also do you have an allergy to ruby? The browser automation is written using Ruby and Capybara.
[10:38:47] <johnbender> its extremely strait forward though
[10:38:59] <johnbender> straight
[10:43:29] <jzaefferer> johnbender: I'm fine with that
[10:57:14] <toddparker> back button madness!
[10:58:06] <toddparker> kinblas: is tbenzige around?
[10:58:14] <toddparker> would;t mind having him in the meeting
[10:59:04] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, he's on IRC
[10:59:56] <toddparker> marked as away
[10:59:57] <toddparker> no worries
[11:00:17] <toddparker> so meeting now
[11:00:24] <toddparker> head on over. i'll call on skype
[11:00:28] <toddparker> just emailed some stuff
[11:03:36] <TehShrike|Work> ugh, I can't get my buttons to get styled
[11:03:57] <TehShrike|Work> I noted the rc2 docs http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc2/docs/buttons/buttons-methods.html
[11:04:18] <TehShrike|Work> And upgraded to rc2, switched my buttons to <input type='submit' />
[11:04:26] <TehShrike|Work> And tried that refresh code, but no luck
[11:12:06] <TehShrike|Work> Whoops, that bitching was meant for #jquerymobile.  My apologies
[11:16:07] <TehShrike|Work> Well, in any case, there appears to be a mistake in the docs.  $('[type='submit']').button('refresh'); does not work, but $('[type='submit']').button(); does.

[12:51:15] <bot-t> Wilto, Is that a question?
[12:51:26] <toddparker> assigned to johnbender but if eddiemonge want to tackle this, that would be super
[12:51:32] <Wilto> oh god it’s just like terminator said
[12:51:55] <eddiemonge> toddparker: it already is
[12:52:00] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[12:52:12] <toddparker> yeah?
[12:52:16] <toddparker> when did we add that?
[12:52:28] <Wilto> Sent, gseguin.
[12:52:40] <toddparker> i downloaded a zip earlier today to upload the the msft CDN and it didn't have it
[12:52:41] <toddparker> http://www.asp.net/ajaxLibrary/CDNjQueryMobile10rc2.ashx
[12:52:46] <johnbender> I'm going to finish installing VS and then install the phone sdk and it won't reproduce the issue
[12:52:49] <gseguin> Wilto: thanks!
[12:52:50] * johnbender is calling it
[12:53:09] <toddparker> johnbender: the structure addition? ok
[12:53:15] <johnbender> toddparker: oh no
[12:53:29] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm calling the fact that the emulator won't work properly
[12:53:37] <toddparker> ah!
[12:53:41] <eddiemonge> hmm
[12:57:34] <toddparker> so i know the structure files are up on the CDN, but not included in the zip
[12:57:48] <toddparker> might be ok for RC2, but we need to fix this for the next release
[12:58:57] <eddiemonge> i see what the problem is. fixing now
[13:01:11] <toddparker> col, thanks eddiemonge

[13:10:42] <eddiemonge> i do
[13:10:49] <eddiemonge> oh actually maybe i didnt that time
[13:11:22] <eddiemonge> too many repos im working on at once. dont always check to see if im in master before i create the new branch i think
[13:12:14] <johnbender> eddiemonge: Wilto: toddparker: http://i.imgur.com/tdx3A.png
[13:12:29] <johnbender> definitely want to get rid of those :(
[13:12:36] <gnarf> cherry-pick them
[13:13:22] <Wilto> How, uh… How do I do that?
[13:13:25] <gnarf> that merge branch 'master' happens when you pull after commiting
[13:13:37] <gnarf> so like a) don't work on master directly
[13:13:52] <gnarf> b) if someone beats you to a commit, be prepared to reset --hard your master
[13:14:06] <johnbender> or just rebase ...
[13:14:07] <johnbender> :/
[13:14:12] <Wilto> Yeah, talk me through rebase.
[13:14:25] <johnbender> I think we have that schedule for post 1.0 lol
[13:14:28] <gnarf> johnbender: i find it easier to understand a reset/cherry-pick than a rebase
[13:14:36] <gseguin> johnbender: what's the problem with having Merge commits?
[13:14:36] <johnbender> gnarf: there's not much to understand
[13:14:37] <Wilto> I was rebasing working in my repo, like… “git fetch upstream” “git rebase upstream/master”
[13:14:57] <johnbender> gseguin: when they have nothing to do with the alterations being made the code it's bad
[13:15:23] <johnbender> gnarf: though your point is well taken, cherrypicking is easy
[13:15:27] <gnarf> so like, if i made a commit on master
[13:15:37] <gnarf> and its sha is "1234567"
[13:15:41] <johnbender> gnarf: reseting --hard on your branches though is dangerous and can cause lost work
[13:16:01] <gnarf> if i go to push and get told its not a fast forward

[13:16:22] <johnbender> gnarf: git fetch upstream; git rebase upstream/master
[13:16:27] <eddiemonge> hmm its something that only recently started happening with my repo
[13:16:30] <johnbender> gnarf: but there's subtlety there
[13:16:36] <gnarf> i do > git fetch upstream ; git reset --hard upstream/master ; git cherry-pick 1234567 ; git push
[13:16:56] <Wilto> Wait. So should I… Add the master as “upstream?”
[13:17:08] <johnbender> gnarf: doing a reset --hard is dangerous there
[13:17:11] <gnarf> Wilto: if you use jquery/jquerymobile as "origin"
[13:17:20] <gnarf> johnbender: its ALWAYS dangerous to reset --hard
[13:17:25] <johnbender> right
[13:17:27] <Wilto> Huh. Okay.
[13:17:29] <gnarf> but its way easy when you know its one commit
[13:17:38] <gnarf> and you have only one SHA to put on top again
[13:17:44] <gnarf> you will never lose the SHA
[13:17:52] <gnarf> it stays in your repo until you clone a new one
[13:18:01] <johnbender> still seems odd when you can just rebase onto the latest
[13:18:01] <gnarf> just don't lose track of your head
[13:18:12] <Wilto> Ba-dum tss.
[13:18:12] <gnarf> johnbender: rebase has NEVER worked right for me
[13:18:19] <johnbender> ??
[13:18:22] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #159: SUCCESS in 10 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/159/
[13:18:23] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * unknown: Moved .ui-br class from swatches section to structure section of default theme.  Added .ui-br to Valencia theme.
[13:18:23] <johnbender> I use it all day every day
[13:18:23] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: whitespace in button markup
[13:18:31] <Wilto> Rebase was working great for me, from my repo.
[13:18:33] <johnbender> and I always have a clean history on my pushes
[13:18:47] <gnarf> johnbender: i always end up having to resolve a bunch of non-related conflicts
[13:18:50] <johnbender> the only thing you have to remember is to not rebase published commits
[13:19:11] <johnbender> gnarf: that depends on the branch you're rebasing
[13:19:22] <johnbender> if the branch is super long lived then you might have to merge
[13:19:28] <johnbender> anything short lived should be a rebase
[13:19:32] <johnbender> to keep the history linear
[13:19:35] <johnbender> and clean
[13:19:40] <gnarf> johnbender: lets just say, i find it easier to rebase using checkout and cherry-pick
[13:19:59] <gnarf> cuz my brain wraps around the magic then
[13:20:08] <gnarf> were rebase is like a black box of fuck up my branch
[13:20:14] <gnarf> the 3 times i've tried using it
[13:20:14] <gnarf> :)
[13:20:15] <johnbender> lol
[13:20:30] <johnbender> gnarf: if it works for you then more power to you
[13:20:35] <johnbender> definitely
[13:20:43] <johnbender> and rebase can be confusing for sure
[13:21:05] <johnbender> either way at least there aren't merge commits FROM maste TO master lol

[13:55:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #2779 from bjohn465/unenhanced-list-icons - Todd Parker
[13:55:39] <toddparker> thanks gseguin
[13:55:49] <toddparker> man, lots of new pulls today
[13:56:03] <toddparker> good to see some clean, helpful fixes from the community
[13:56:15] <toddparker> we just need to keep up with reviewing
[13:56:40] <Wilto> Yeah, I’ll start keeping an eye out for those, toddparker. I can grab some of ‘em.
[13:57:14] * johnbender puts on his taskmaster hat
[13:57:33] <johnbender> Wilto: toddparker: as long as we add tests for the fixes (and features in the future)
[13:57:40] * johnbender takes off his taskmaster hat
[13:57:53] <johnbender> so close to being done with this sdk install
[13:58:05] <toddparker> EPIC INSTALL
[13:58:41] <toddparker> put the hat down johnbender and step away slowly
[14:00:56] <Wilto> I’m gonna study up on the tests tonight, methinks. That stuff is all foreign to me.
[14:01:00] <Wilto> I may be asking for advice.
[14:05:54] <johnbender> Wilto: that's advice I'd be happy to give
[14:08:25] <johnbender> it is only now occuring to me that Visual Studio is a very odd name for a bloated text editor
[14:08:36] <johnbender> though I'm well aware of the drag and drop nature of many of the tools
[14:09:35] <kinblas> toddparker: gseguin: regarding pull 2778 ... I'd rather the fix not be recursive ... we can simply gather the parents and loop over them  till we find a match ... This thing gets called a lot so I don't want to incur recursive function calls for every component we find if we can help it
[14:10:30] <johnbender> EMULATOR IS SNAPPY
[14:10:31] <johnbender> NICE!
[14:10:48] <kinblas> johnbender: which? Winphone7?
[14:10:53] <johnbender> yah buddy
[14:11:09] <johnbender> and the corners are rounded
[14:11:13] <johnbender> actually
[14:11:16] <johnbender> everything looks brillian
[14:11:20] <johnbender> brilliant
[14:11:28] <johnbender> I'm just worried that this won't repro on the emulator
[14:11:30] <johnbender> :(
[14:11:45] <gseguin> kinblas: do you want to comment on it?
[14:12:05] <gseguin> kinblas: I can pick another pull
[14:12:58] <johnbender> kinblas: toddparker: well there is one odd behavior
[14:13:16] <johnbender> if I you don't change focus from the native select it and go click on ANOTHER select
[14:13:19] <johnbender> it opens the first one
[14:13:21] <johnbender> still testing
[14:13:40] <johnbender> incidentally I really like the browser chrome at the bottom
[14:14:16] <toddparker> i'm fine with that assessment kinblasm say no thanks
[14:14:25] <toddparker> so the emulator is snappy johnbender
[14:14:27] <toddparker> shocker
[14:14:30] <johnbender> I'm stoked
[14:14:35] <johnbender> I was dreading that
[14:15:16] <toddparker> maybe i should download
[14:15:20] <toddparker> so things look good?
[14:15:20] <johnbender> kinblas: yes one DOM traversal with the selector please
[14:15:29] <toddparker> wonder if touch events are supported
[14:15:29] <johnbender> toddparker: well the select issue is real
[14:15:36] <toddparker> yeah?
[14:15:38] <johnbender> yah
[14:15:38] <toddparker> bummer
[14:15:42] <johnbender> if you click a native select
[14:15:45] <toddparker> guess you gotta fix it now
[14:15:53] <johnbender> then you have to find a way to change focus or clicking ANYWHERE brings it back up
[14:15:55] <toddparker> only you can save the selects on mango
[14:15:58] <johnbender> lol
[14:15:59] <johnbender> Mango
[14:16:12] <toddparker> wha?
[14:16:15] <johnbender> toddparker: kinblas:http://www.hulu.com/watch/4114/saturday-night-live-mango-and-j-lo
[14:16:23] <toddparker> so it opens but doesn't stay closed
[14:16:48] <toddparker> can't shake it? like a booger stuck on your finger…that's mango's selects?
[14:16:53] <TehShrike|Work> Who do I report documentation issues to?
[14:17:06] <toddparker> in the tracker TehShrike|Work
[14:17:08] <johnbender> toddparker: no it closes
[14:17:15] <toddparker> you can also edit the docs and submit a pull
[14:17:23] <toddparker> you can even edit in the githb web UI
[14:17:23] <johnbender> toddparker: but you can't click anywhere otherwise it pops up
[14:17:40] <toddparker> such an odd issue johnbender
[14:18:12] <TehShrike|Work> toddparker: that makes so much sense it's ridiculous
[14:19:00] <toddparker> the "edit yourself" suggestion TehShrike|Work
[14:19:07] <toddparker> :)
[14:19:38] <kinblas> toddparker: gseguin: I updated the pull with a comment ... I think the reallity of someone using ui-bar-a-foo is unlikely
[14:19:52] <kinblas> especially since we follow the convention of having the theme letter be last

[14:21:25] <TehShrike|Work> toddparker: huh, that's a good idea.  I haven't worked with github before, what operations do I perform in order to contribute new/altered content?
[14:21:27] <toddparker> swatches aren't classes people
[14:21:52] <kinblas> toddparker: you don't like class a, b, and c? They minify well? :-P
[14:22:12] <toddparker> pre-minified
[14:22:28] <toddparker> the letters allow themes to be portable. repeat after me...
[14:22:29] <kinblas> man I"m getting lots of github email
[14:22:41] <toddparker> TehShrike|Work: just navigate the source to a file:
[14:22:41] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/docs/index.html
[14:22:41] <kinblas> are things hoppin' or what? I'm having a hard time keeping up with stuff
[14:22:48] <toddparker> and click the "edit this file" button
[14:23:09] <toddparker> if you're not a commiter, i think it makes a pull request

[14:41:58] <kinblas> woah big earthquake
[14:48:03] <TehShrike|Work> It tells me that I need to fork this documentation in order to edit it
[14:48:13] <TehShrike|Work> So then I do... something... to suggest that it should go back in?
[14:48:22] <TehShrike|Work> I'm not a git guy :-x
[14:48:58] <kinblas> TehShrike|Work you make a pull request ... you can do that from the Browser I believe
[14:49:19] <kinblas> *after* you checkin your changes to your forked repository
[14:49:33] <TehShrike|Work> Ah, cool.  Will do.
[14:49:36] <toddparker> yeah TehShrike|Work - i explained how to do it from the web interface above
[14:49:51] <toddparker> earthquake kinblas
[14:49:53] <toddparker> you ok?
[14:51:05] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah it was just a big jolt ... weird to see the building moving
[14:51:53] <TehShrike|Work> Pull request sent.  Yay, I'm a contributor!
[14:53:37] <toddparker> *see* the building moving?!?
[14:56:06] <johnbender> toddparker: kinblas: Wilto: gseguin: linkBindingEnabled is what I settled on
[14:56:12] <johnbender> though I can see flaws in that
[14:56:19] <johnbender> it's tested
[14:58:40] <johnbender> kinblas: yah I just saw a flurry of tweets
[14:58:41] <johnbender> is all well?
[14:58:52] <johnbender> gseguin: are you cool too?
[14:59:30] <johnbender> kinblas: better go check those huge wood pillars in the lobby
[14:59:35] <toddparker> i like that name johnbender
[14:59:37] <johnbender> they looked sketchy to me at my orientation
[14:59:40] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah all is well .. it's ironic that today is California's Great Shakeout
[14:59:51] <johnbender> yah! its supposed to be a drill day!
[14:59:51] <johnbender> lol
[15:02:11] <johnbender> probably shouldn't laugh at that, earthquakes are scary
[15:02:23] <johnbender> gseguin: you're in SF too eh?
[15:02:35] <gseguin> johnbender: cool with? the naming or the quake?
[15:02:42] <johnbender> gseguin: the quake
[15:02:42] <gseguin> Palo Alto
[15:02:49] <johnbender> screw the naming
[15:02:57] <johnbender> all is well I take it?
[15:03:06] <gseguin> didn't even feel it
[15:03:37] <gseguin> yeah yeah we're alright here, sorry I was catching up
[15:04:42] <Wilto> Hey TehShrike|Work: Were you calling “.button('refresh')” to initially enhance a native form element?

[15:42:31] * kinblas tries to figure out how to respond to the last comment in issue 450
[15:51:54] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm so confused
[15:52:32] <kinblas> so am I
[15:52:38] <kinblas> I'm about to submit a long comment
[15:53:25] <gseguin> kinblas: very confused as well
[15:53:46] <kinblas> comment updated
[15:55:58] <gseguin> kinblas: in issue 2784 there are 2 elements with the same id in his test page
[15:56:07] <johnbender> kinblas: that insane sequence of events from the poster directly after the issue close is an entirely different issue
[15:56:12] <johnbender> I'm happy to address that
[15:57:07] <johnbender> kinblas: I think most of their problems a related to the fact that the page is separate eh?
[15:57:27] <johnbender> ?foo=bar will add one page and ?foo=baz will add another
[15:57:29] <bot-t> johnbender, .index() - Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[15:57:29] <johnbender> as it should
[15:57:48] <kinblas> johnbender: actually there are multiple issues
[15:57:57] <kinblas> some folks are confused about what you just said
[15:58:10] <kinblas> other folks want to be able to pass query params to embedded page
[15:58:12] <kinblas> hence the proposal
[15:58:24] <kinblas> #embedded-page?foo=1&bar=2
[15:58:42] <kinblas> note that embedded-page is an id reference not an external file
[15:58:52] <kinblas> the original issue was about the fact that we used to drop the query params
[15:58:59] <kinblas> for external pages
[15:59:04] <johnbender> right, which is fixed
[15:59:08] <kinblas> RIGHT!
[15:59:12] <johnbender> lol
[15:59:15] <johnbender> well I'm happy to chime in here
[15:59:21] <johnbender> this thing is crazytown
[15:59:39] <kinblas> and then some guy comes in and says why do you guys insist on ignoring developers blah blah
[15:59:53] <kinblas> man I didn't even close the bugs you referred to above?
[15:59:58] <kinblas> :-)
[16:00:07] <kinblas> I just want folks to file their own issue
[16:00:09] <kinblas> so we can stop guessig
[16:00:12] <kinblas> guessing
[16:00:22] <kinblas> what you want or what you mean when you say "it still doesn't work"
[16:00:26] <kinblas> what doesn't work?
[16:00:31] <kinblas> :-)
[16:00:54] <gseguin> kinblas: answer to that should be: "it works for me" :P
[16:01:00] <kinblas> LOL
[16:03:26] <johnbender> kinblas: yah that nisc guy has a duplicat page element I'm willing to bet
[16:04:00] <johnbender> I responded to his new issue
[16:04:04] <johnbender> CRAZYTOWN!
[16:04:20] <johnbender> definitely ignore the guy who wants us to parse query params for him
[16:04:35] <johnbender> kinblas: ^
[16:05:36] <kinblas> so is it just me or does that guy's test case not demonstrate his problem
[16:05:48] <kinblas> sure it shows that we create a new page, and the page has a duplicate id
[16:05:49] <gseguin> wait
[16:06:14] <gseguin> the double id thing seems to be caused by jQM
[16:06:36] <johnbender> gseguin: there are two pages with the same content being pulled into the document
[16:06:54] <kinblas> gseguin: it's a new page because of the query params ... but what we load has a dup id
[16:07:00] <gseguin> yeah
[16:07:11] <johnbender> I actually haven't even looked at the code OR DOM
[16:07:11] <kinblas> I think john asked the question I was wondering "can you be more specific"
[16:07:30] <johnbender> kinblas: well he said that his id selector and the hide method weren't working
[16:07:42] <johnbender> which means he's selecting a different element with the same id
[16:08:11] <kinblas> johnbender: right because it's a crap shoot as to which #somediv the browser is going to return
[16:08:19] <kinblas> the one in the hidden div? Or the one in the div showing?
[16:08:22] <gseguin> that's because since it's a different url we pull it again and create the page
[16:08:32] <gseguin> or rather REcreate the page
[16:08:35] <johnbender> gseguin: HAVE TO
[16:08:40] <johnbender> they are different resources
[16:08:42] <gseguin> I know
[16:08:46] <gseguin> I'm just saying
[16:08:57] <gseguin> I understand why the guys is confused
[16:09:08] <johnbender> gseguin: and I know you know, but the emphasis is for the universe of people who don't know much about url design / REST
[16:09:38] <johnbender> if you build you're whole app into index.php you're going to have issues
[16:10:08] <johnbender> what's interesting is that if dom-cache is disabled and it's not the first page that loads all will be well because we reap that pages anyway
[16:10:11] <gseguin> absolutely
[16:10:21] <johnbender> *reap those pages
[16:10:35] <kinblas> ... or if we reaped embedded pages
[16:12:20] <johnbender> ok I'm going to respond to this guy
[16:14:50] <gseguin> johnbender: I think nisc needs to understand why his .hide() is not working
[16:18:37] <johnbender> gseguin: I made an attempt at illustrating for him
[16:19:27] <johnbender> 10 to 1 he comes back with "That's so stupid"
[16:19:52] <johnbender> kinblas: and reaping isn't relevant here from my perspective because it would behave this way if it was turned off

[16:20:24] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: whitepsace in globalconfig docs
[16:20:25] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: linkBindingEnabled docs
[16:21:17] <johnbender> blarg
[16:21:30] <johnbender> there's a failure in nav for firefox :(
[16:21:35] <johnbender> I'll have to address that tomorrow
[16:25:53] <eddiemonge> so far, i like honeycomb way better than ios. it looks better, runs awesomely and is far more functional
[16:26:00] <eddiemonge> :justsaying:
[16:27:21] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I was super excited when I saw that there would be a new google phone
[16:27:27] <johnbender> but the screen is ... gargantuan
[16:27:32] <johnbender> 4.6 inches
[16:27:38] <johnbender> competing on specs much?
[16:27:39] <eddiemonge> and so far its only on verizon
[16:27:44] <johnbender> yes
[16:28:00] <johnbender> the whole android browser debacle makes me want to get a blackberry
[16:28:08] <eddiemonge> although, before the evo came out, a 4.3" screen was unheard of and now its almost the norm
[16:28:13] <johnbender> at least they're getting hardware accel for animations
[16:28:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I have an evo but it feels really overboard
[16:28:26] <eddiemonge> but their phones are crap and so is their os
[16:28:34] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I like the phone hardware
[16:28:39] <johnbender> I have sausage thumbs
[16:28:46] <johnbender> the OS is indeed lame
[16:29:14] <eddiemonge> perfection would be webOS on the new moto razr
[16:29:17] <johnbender> if I knew with any certainty that the new 9900 was going to get a qnx update next year I would go buy one
[16:29:24] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I miss webos
[16:29:41] <TehShrike|Work> Wilto: I was calling it when loading a page for a second time, after adding a new button to it that was not there the first time it was loaded
[16:29:54] <eddiemonge> they need to opensource that shit and let us put it on our android phones
[16:34:45] <TehShrike|Work> Wilto: I was adding a new button to a page, and then attempting to get jQuery Mobile to apply styles to it
[16:46:08] <johnbender> well my hopes that the windows phone bug would be reproducible in ie 9 have been dashed
[16:49:54] <gseguin> johnbender: are you keeping your zen?
[16:50:46] <johnbender> gseguin: with regards to that issue or windows phone?
[16:51:03] <johnbender> I'd like to note I think it's amazing you think I have zen at all
[16:51:04] <gseguin> johnbender: both ;)
[16:51:11] <johnbender> I perceive myself to be rather spastic
[16:51:25] <johnbender> gseguin: trying I guess :D
[16:55:08] <kinblas> johnbender: just finished installing the wp7 emulator
[16:55:11] <kinblas> :-)
[16:56:53] <johnbender> kinblas: you are not fixing that bug btw
[16:56:59] <johnbender> I claim it!
[16:57:09] <johnbender> crap!
[16:57:21] <johnbender> I owe jzaefferer docs on the ci setup
[16:57:50] <kinblas> johnbender: lol, you can have it ... I just want to make sure I have a virtual phone!
[16:58:05] <kinblas> stop workin' blind
[16:58:16] <kinblas> be able to run some of my own event tests, etc
[17:06:23] <gseguin> johnbender: I think you earned the privilege of closing issue 2784

[17:30:34] <johnbender> doing the "mobile framework bake off"
[17:31:03] <johnbender> in which I have to figure out some way to represent the our framework as massively cross platform without trying to run all the emulators at the same time

[21:24:30] <TehShrike> Wilto: I'm sorry, did you ever see/respond to my messages earlier?
[21:28:05] <TehShrike> Wilto: I just read your github post, and you're right, I was applying style to an element that had not existed, and needed styles applied for the first time
[21:28:27] <TehShrike> As opposed to a pre-existing element that needed to have styles re-applied to it
