[06:50:32] <uGoMobi> todd_:  re: -moz-border-radius... yes, FF desktop/mobile 4+ supports the unprefixed version so we can drop the prefix
[06:51:03] <uGoMobi> only not completely sure about Firefox for Meego but I even don't know if we support that
[06:51:49] <uGoMobi> Fennec / Firefox Mobile landscape is not really clear to me
[06:52:25] <uGoMobi> we say JQM supports Firefox Mobile 12 beta + but I can't find anything about a 12 beta release

[07:06:26] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup] Perform the visual open only when the nav hook has been acquired -- Fixes #4949 - Gabriel Schulhof
[07:09:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Can you please test https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4949 with the latest master. My fix WORKSFORME, but I think it should be tested thoroughly.
[07:09:32] <_|Nix|_> s/r\./r?/
[07:14:05] <Wilto> Morning, all.
[07:14:37] <_|Nix|_> Yo ho ho and a barrel of grog!
[07:17:03] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: The popup-jumping-to-the-centre-of-the-screen issue should now be consigned to the history books, but some independent confirmation couldn't hurt. Thus, if you have a Cupertino-esque device within your reach ...
[07:17:25] <Wilto> Oh, I have one or… five, on my desk.
[07:23:00] <_|Nix|_> The only downside is that I had to move the visual open of the popup to after the nav hook acquisition. This increases the delay with which the popup opens.
[07:24:08] <_|Nix|_> However, it seems that the nav hook acquisition comes with a complimentary resize event (thankfully) /preceding/ the hashchange event.
[07:45:28] <todd_> Good morning
[07:45:41] <todd_> uGoMobi: this might be a fun thing to work on for a future release - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4956
[07:46:44] <todd_> Wilto: try the iPad and nav in from the homepage
[07:47:08] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: I wouldn’t want to introduce a delay everywhere for the sake of one iOS issue, is all.
[07:48:04] <Wilto> I know iOS is weird about firing resizes, but I can usually work around that by throttling them.
[07:48:19] <todd_> _|Nix|_: I agree. Speed is the #1 priority so let's give this another look
[07:50:24] <Wilto> ON IT.
[08:10:59] <_|Nix|_> This is how it was before the refactor. That is, we waited for the nav hook before displaying. It's not a delay in the setTimeout() sense, but a delay in the sense that the user clicks, and we have to wait for the hashchange event (which has no visual feedback) before we can start the animations.
[08:11:08] <_|Nix|_> So this may not be so bad.
[08:11:20] * _|Nix|_ go Ikea - BBL
[08:11:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: will test that
[08:13:10] <uGoMobi> todd_: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4956 we already have the grid funtion (will answer that and add some info to the docs when I have time)
[08:13:37] <uGoMobi> todd_: I suggest to turn grid function into a widget as well, just like controlgroup https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2126
[08:13:51] <uGoMobi> I think I already added that to the roadmap document
[08:17:02] <uGoMobi> edit: just like we want to do for controlgroup
[08:23:41] <Wilto> Hey _|Nix|_, did you try screwing around with the setTimeout in `_maybeRefreshTimeout`?
[08:24:29] <Wilto> I nudged it from 200 to 300, just for the hell of it—might be a coincidence, but I’m having trouble recreating the issue on iOS now.
[08:31:04] <DaveMethvin> Wilto's Law: If there's a race condition, make sure you always win the race.
[08:31:04] <bot-t> (3 hours 22 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell DaveMethvin Do you want me to just delete the docs tutorials?
[08:31:39] <Wilto> That’s why I use setTimeouts for every line of my code, DaveMethvin. It’s like writing BASIC!
[08:31:52] <DaveMethvin> how asynchronous of you!
[08:34:38] <Wilto> Alright. $20 says I can fix this in CSS alone. Any takers?
[08:35:45] <Wilto> Eh, eh?
[08:35:51] <uGoMobi> todd_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4955 how about using a class of ui-responsive? if you add that to any of the parent elements of the grid + window is smaller than 650px the full width grid layout will apply
[08:37:57] <Wilto> Tch. FINE. I’ll fix it for FREE.
[08:38:01] <Wilto> stupid open source
[09:42:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/3b40d0374c11ccae31ada39e5813927abb2376f9
[09:42:14] <johnbender> how does that play with popups sans history
[09:42:27] <johnbender> since there's no call to _open
[09:44:52] <Wilto> Soooo.
[09:45:17] <Wilto> The overlay is triggering resizes in iOS, as large elements are wont to do in iOS.
[09:45:48] <Wilto> Setting top, left, etc. to 0px or using width: 100%; height: 100%; trigger it.
[09:46:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah, my tests are passing for god knows what reason but that change broke historyless popups
[09:49:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: working on fixing the tests now

[10:04:54] <Wilto> Hell yes it is.
[10:06:46] <Wilto> …waitasec.
[10:07:06] <Wilto> Why aren’t we using `position: fixed` for the popup overlay, in qualifying browsers?
[10:07:18] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ I reverted the fix to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4949
[10:07:19] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[10:07:56] <Wilto> Then it would only ever occupy the viewport if supported, and all the same styles would cause it to occupy the full page if we defaulted it back to `position: absolute`.

[10:08:16] <johnbender> Wilto: not sure
[10:08:20] <Wilto> …except that it would introduce a dependency on the fixed business.
[10:08:47] <Wilto> But it would serve as a major performance enhancement in supporting browsers, and make no difference from what we have now in non-supporting browsers.
[10:10:53] <Wilto> todd_, wat’chu think? Also _|Nix|_. ^
[10:16:31] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[10:50:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] fix tests to reflect initial page dialog support - John Bender
[11:06:18] <Wilto> The trouble with this industry is that one is so seldom “pleasantly surprised” by a browser, and so often “shocked and disappointed.” It is a recipe for cynicism.
[11:06:31] <Wilto> Anyway, this `resize` in iOS bug is going great.
[11:24:06] <_|Nix|_> OK, I'm back ...
[11:24:07] <bot-t> (1 hour 16 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ I reverted the fix to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4949
[11:24:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Why not just insert another call to _open() for the non-history case?
[11:25:46] <Wilto> ?BOOM
[11:25:47] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[11:25:50] <Wilto> FIXED WITH CSS
[11:25:55] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Nice!
[11:26:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't have a device to test on :(
[11:26:02] <Wilto> Friggin’ iOS, man.
[11:26:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I blew it with the history tests sorry about that
[11:26:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP, especially if Wilto nailed it in CSS.
[11:26:39] <Wilto> aww cheah
[11:26:44] <johnbender> very nice
[11:26:58] <johnbender> Wilto: that's for 4949?
[11:26:58] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Don't forget about the Android 4.0 hangage when the screen is top/left/right/bottom 0px;
[11:27:00] <Wilto> Just ultraconfirming now.
[11:27:11] <Wilto> God, that was a dumb one. No change there.
[11:27:32] <johnbender> Wilto: so you're not working on 4949?
[11:27:32] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: OK.
[11:27:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: 4949 is ipad only right?
[11:27:57] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Can't wait to see the commit.
[11:28:05] <Wilto> It is shockingly simple.
[11:28:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: No. I reproduced it on my iPod.
[11:28:19] <Wilto> I do still want to consider fixing the overlay in whitelisted browsers.
[11:28:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: let me see if I can repro unless you want to make those two changes
[11:28:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm inclined to leave your revert in place if Wilto can fix it in CSS.
[11:29:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: Wilto: so you are working on 4949 in css?
[11:32:42] <Wilto> Yessir.
[11:32:47] <Wilto> I HAVE A BENDER QUESTION™
[11:33:23] <Wilto> So, on using `position: fixed` for the overlay: using the whitelist from fixed toolbars means introducing a nonsensical dependency.
[11:33:36] <Wilto> Duplicating it is weak sauce.
[11:34:17] <Wilto> I’m thinking, where fixing the overlay makes a pretty noticeable difference in rendering speed (occupying the viewport vs. occupying a bigass page) in browsers that support fixed well, we do one of two things:
[11:35:59] <Wilto> 1) A *short* whitelist for `fixed` overlays. 2) Move the `fixed` header/footer blacklist to `support`
[11:36:10] <Wilto> It might be worth exposing that list to authors, as well.
[11:36:20] <Wilto> ugh god now web standards has me saying “authors” too
[11:37:37] <Wilto> johnbender, _|Nix|_ ^
[11:38:11] <johnbender> Wilto: abstracting it to support is a good idea
[11:38:17] <johnbender> exposing it needs further discussion
[11:38:27] <johnbender> basically just don't for now and we can later if we want
[11:38:35] <Wilto> Yeah, I’m cool with that.
[11:38:46] <Wilto> Something to consider at some stage.
[11:38:51] <Wilto> Should this happen in a branch?
[11:39:03] <johnbender> Wilto: if it's experimental sure
[11:39:06] <johnbender> when in doubt
[11:39:07] <johnbender> branch
[11:39:37] <Wilto> johnbender: http://wil.to/_/approval.png
[11:39:48] <johnbender> yar
[11:47:51] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: WORKSFORME
[11:48:17] <Wilto> Sweet
[11:49:00] <_|Nix|_> Bah! What was the bug number for that 404 issue? I always forget to add Fixes nnnn to the end of my commits ..
[11:50:35] <todd_> going to do a quick blog post on the new logo
[11:51:31] <Wilto> You _designers_.
[11:51:40] <Wilto> Drawing your pictures and whatnot.
[11:54:06] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Can you help me find the 404 issue? You know, the one that required a nav tweak? I don't remember any of its tags or whether it was milestoned 1.2 ...
[11:54:45] <_|Nix|_> It just disappeared on me amidst the torrent of issues.
[11:56:30] <Wilto> Remember that time I thought I fixed some stuff?
[11:56:34] <Wilto> That was fun.
[11:59:50] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So, we must resort to js after all? I mean for 4949?
[12:00:03] <todd_> Hey all - if you're going to the October event, please book your flight to DFW airport
[12:00:22] <_|Nix|_> todd_: What's DFW in English?
[12:00:34] <todd_> _|Nix|_: was that with the advanced options buttons on popup
[12:00:41] <todd_> the name of the airport :)
[12:00:46] <todd_> wait
[12:00:50] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Dallas?
[12:00:55] <_|Nix|_> todd_: I thought it was DC?
[12:01:05] <Wilto> I dunno yet.
[12:01:15] <todd_> wrong code
[12:01:18] <todd_> Dulles, Va
[12:01:18] <Wilto> DIA?
[12:01:21] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Should be IAD
[12:01:25] <gseguin> IAD
[12:01:25] <todd_> riiiight
[12:01:34] <Wilto> I had all the letters, at least.
[12:01:37] <todd_> NOT Dallas
[12:01:38] <_|Nix|_> todd_: You must've meant Dulles which sounds similar to Dallas.
[12:01:45] <todd_> ignore me
[12:01:58] <Wilto> In fairness, I accidentally commute to Austin a couple of times a week.
[12:02:06] <gseguin> I'm all booked
[12:02:19] <_|Nix|_> I'm waiting for my travel request to be approved.
[12:04:17] <agcolom> I'm all booked too... I'm arriving a day early :-) to visit since I'm coming from so far away!!!
[12:05:05] <agcolom> OMG! I got all scared for a sec! I thought i did it wrong booking to IAD!
[12:05:30] <gseguin> yeah did that to me too
[12:05:48] <agcolom> a bit of adrenaline!!!!
[12:06:08] <agcolom> what time are you arriving?
[12:06:19] * gseguin checks
[12:06:46] <gseguin> 15:45
[12:06:46] <_|Nix|_> Man, did I dream I was closing that 404 issue? Can't find it anywhere!
[12:06:56] <gseguin> just in time for the aperitif
[12:07:04] <agcolom> gseguin: perfect!!!!!
[12:10:23] <_|Nix|_> Argh! Could really use a more powerful issue search ... this is ridiculous ...
[12:11:33] <_|Nix|_> Found it! Whee!
[12:17:03] <Wilto> I give up.
[12:17:09] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: OK, so, js?
[12:17:15] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: For 4949?
[12:17:26] <Wilto> Ugh, yeah, lookin’ that way.
[12:17:32] <Wilto> Friggin’ iOS.
[12:17:32] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: NP.
[12:17:47] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: A valiant effort.
[12:17:47] <Wilto> I tried some quick JavaScript stuff I’ve done in the past, too; no dice.
[12:19:07] <_|Nix|_> OK, so, re-revert and address the non-history case.
[12:21:40] <Wilto> If anyone needs me, I’ll be over here listening to http://wil.to/_/gameover.mp3
[12:23:33] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Gotta be careful with that file and earphones ... can be an earful :)
[12:23:54] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I think I just bought myself another hour of awake-time ...
[12:24:01] <Wilto> Whoop, sorry about that.
[12:24:22] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Nah, not your fault ... it's cool ...
[12:24:37] <Wilto> I blame Koji Kondo.
[12:24:44] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I needed the jolt, anyway. Indeed.
[12:24:46] <Wilto> If any of you get that, I am at once proud and deeply ashamed of you.

[12:33:06] <_|Nix|_> OK, so the 4949 fix is back, and I just tested on the unit tests and a WP7 brick and it worked.
[12:33:47] <_|Nix|_> The only issue that remains is that we don't wanna wait for the hashchange, but we wanna launch the animations as soon as humanly possible.
[12:34:41] <_|Nix|_> So now, things should be correct and no worse than before the refactor in terms of popup appearance responsiveness.
[12:44:48] <Wilto> —Wait a second.

[13:29:28] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Might wanna set the default overlay theme to a or something, just to see the overlays.
[13:29:35] <Wilto> NEVER yeah okay.
[13:29:58] <Wilto> I just put a black background in the CSS for my testing; that’s a better move.
[13:30:10] <_|Nix|_> *nod*
[13:31:17] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Looks nice on Lumia 800 ... though the fixed positioning can't keep up with the scrolling.

[13:32:30] <Wilto> Scale of 1–10, how gross is it?
[13:33:00] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I have no sense of esthetics whatsoever. Don't believe me? Ask my wife.
[13:34:17] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: If you scroll reasonably, the overlay is rock-solid. I guess it could be considered to be holding water.
[13:34:53] <_|Nix|_> Only when you start whacking the touchscreen like there's no tomorrow does the illusion break down.

[13:37:04] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: It'd be quite a coup.
[13:38:12] <_|Nix|_> iOS is looking far more solid. Only once did I see the can't-keep-up behaviour, otherwise it was so-lid.
[13:39:54] <_|Nix|_> Android 2.3.5 is a disaster.
[13:40:00] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/mad-decent.gif
[13:40:03] <Wilto> MOTHERFU
[13:40:20] <Wilto> I’ve been looking at the Android pile and just shaking my head quietly.
[13:40:22] <_|Nix|_> It behaves correctly, mind you, but it doesn't even attempt to keep up.
[13:40:24] <Wilto> I had a feeling.
[13:40:37] <Wilto> Wait. They should be blacklisted…?
[13:41:15] <_|Nix|_> Well, not sure what it falls back to in case of blacklisting, but it sure don't work.
[13:41:28] <_|Nix|_> Should it stretch to the size of the document if blacklisted?
[13:41:42] <Wilto> Yeah; should just fall back to absolute.
[13:41:45] <_|Nix|_> Like "in the olden days"?
[13:41:57] <Wilto> Ah hell.
[13:42:05] * _|Nix|_ hastily checks out master
[13:42:07] <Wilto> `Platform is Android and Webkit version is less than 533 (Android 2.2)`
[13:42:16] <Wilto> So 2.3 makes the cut.
[13:42:17] <Wilto> Gross.

[13:48:31] <Wilto> …
[13:49:13] <uGoMobi> looks like on ICS the issue with the popup being underneath the overlay is back
[13:49:23] <_|Nix|_> Hut diggety!
[13:49:26] <uGoMobi> that is on Chrome on ICS
[13:49:29] <_|Nix|_> Oh, great ...
[13:49:38] <uGoMobi> not the native browser
[13:49:40] <Wilto> …wait.
[13:51:19] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... can I install Chrome onto my 4.0.3 emulation?
[13:51:45] <uGoMobi> no
[13:51:51] <_|Nix|_> Booo!
[13:51:51] <uGoMobi> i tried before
[13:51:56] <uGoMobi> but it hangs
[13:52:08] <_|Nix|_> Same with 4.0?
[13:52:15] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:52:21] <_|Nix|_> What about 4.1?
[13:52:27] <_|Nix|_> Is that still ICS?
[13:52:35] <uGoMobi> 4.1 default browser is chrome
[13:52:44] <uGoMobi> 4.1 is jelly bean
[13:52:48] <uGoMobi> not ICS
[13:52:50] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK ...
[13:52:55] <_|Nix|_> St00pid names.
[13:53:02] <_|Nix|_> I remember numbers far better.
[13:53:12] <uGoMobi> are you sure? ;)
[13:53:21] <Wilto> Ugh, right, because `position: fixed` is in play again.
[13:53:30] <Wilto> How did we sort that with the toolbars…? Was that me?
[13:53:50] <_|Nix|_> Well, I was on vacation, so "I didn't do it".
[13:54:16] <uGoMobi> good alibi
[13:54:28] <agcolom> Hi, quick one: anyone here can mute the #jquery-meeting channel?
[13:54:37] <_|Nix|_> Yep ... didn't even have internet access ..
[13:54:48] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/17eb6619a7e35a3fc229c8e206e51cc35dcaa078
[13:54:55] <Wilto> …dammit.
[13:55:00] <agcolom> (I think it is not normally kept open)
[13:55:06] <Wilto> Okay, well, quick fix.
[13:56:12] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Oh, that one ...
[13:56:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: i think todd_ ajpiano DaveMethvin can do that
[13:56:46] <agcolom> ok, thx.
[13:57:04] <DaveMethvin> i got it
[13:57:15] <uGoMobi> thanks DaveMethvin
[13:57:18] <agcolom> thanks DaveMethvin
[13:57:26] <agcolom> thanks uGoMobi :-)
[13:57:37] <uGoMobi> thanks agcolom :)
[13:57:57] <DaveMethvin> i turned off the lights too
[13:58:07] <uGoMobi> cool
[13:58:13] <DaveMethvin> there was a donut left, i eated it
[13:58:29] <uGoMobi> lucky you
[13:58:39] <uGoMobi> also cleaned the floor?
[14:00:59] <Wilto> DaveMethvin: How do I do those things you just did.
[14:01:21] <Wilto> Opsify myself, and then… What is it, send `/MODE +m` to the channel?
[14:01:37] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #622: UNSTABLE in 9 min 46 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/622/
[14:03:00] <DaveMethvin> Wilto: yeah  /mode #jquery-meeting +m
[14:04:15] <Wilto> Why, I’m practically drunk with power already.
[14:05:21] <Wilto> Or just regular drunk. It’s hard to tell sometimes.
[14:12:28] <uGoMobi> Wilto: why position fixed for the overlay and not absolute?
[14:13:25] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Then it only occupies the viewport. Couple hundred pixels, rather than a potentially beastly-huge overlay.
[14:13:29] <Wilto> Much mo’ quicker.
[14:13:46] <Wilto> But if `fixed` isn’t supported, they just get the `absolute` positioning we would’ve used anyway.
[14:13:47] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[14:14:08] <Wilto> It’s an enhancement. “Progressively enhanced,” one might say.
[14:16:08] <Wilto> Why, I may be onto something there.
[14:16:24] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to fixed-popup-overlay: http://git.io/0qqY8A
[14:16:24] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fixed-popup-overlay] Prevents fixed overlay from causing issues in Android 4.0 native browser. See: 17eb6619 - Mat Marquis
[14:16:38] <Wilto> That commit message was very nearly “screw you, Android.”
[14:21:20] <agcolom> quick question again... how far back are we supporting browsers? this issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4957 is for something not working in  FF4 (yes 4, not 14)
[14:21:57] <agcolom> todd_: toddmparker_ ^
[14:22:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: FF4 sounds ages ago but it's not that long ago that they started with rapid releases
[14:22:23] <Wilto> agcolom: I’d say “it was only out for half an hour and twelve people downloaded it in total,” but that’s a major issue.
[14:22:24] <uGoMobi> we support FF4+
[14:22:36] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Yeah. FF4 saw _very_ little uptake.
[14:22:55] <Wilto> But that is also very broken.
[14:24:19] <agcolom> Wilto: do you have FF4 somewhere?? browserstack starts from FF5
[14:25:12] <Wilto> Nope; go fish. I’ve got 6–10 and 16.
[14:25:54] <agcolom> 16?
[14:25:57] <uGoMobi> maybe we should give FF4 a IE6 treatment :)
[14:26:16] <agcolom> I can't keep up! I'm on 14!
[14:26:36] <agcolom> time for some chocolate I think!
[14:28:33] <uGoMobi> I think I got some kind of Fennec simulator that was based on FF4
[14:28:41] <uGoMobi> can give it a look
[14:34:22] <Wilto> I’m thinking we’re almost at the point of saying “within three versions of current” or somesuch, for FF.
[14:35:44] <uGoMobi> yeah sounds like a good idea to me
[14:36:06] <uGoMobi> I can confirm the issue on that emulator
[14:36:30] <uGoMobi> although it's Firefox Mobile it is based on FF4.1
[14:37:10] <agcolom> uGoMobi: brilliant! Well done for thinking about that!
[14:37:40] <uGoMobi> now I have to find a way to debug that thing :(
[14:38:38] <agcolom> yep! sorry ;-)
[14:39:12] <uGoMobi> haha it's ok
[14:39:56] <uGoMobi> not really high priority issue so I better not spend too much time on it now
[14:41:52] <Wilto> Eh, yeah. Take a stab; maybe we’ll luck out and it’ll be something quick.

[14:59:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/testswarm] remove trailing comma - John Bender
[15:09:32] <agcolom> yippee! just closed one issue :-)
[15:10:56] <uGoMobi> that FF4 issue is caused by the changes we made to transitions in 1.1
[15:13:39] <agcolom> oh!
[15:15:32] <uGoMobi> agcolom: can you test this issue that you opened long time ago? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2811
[15:15:42] <uGoMobi> maybe you can close another one :D
[15:22:27] <agcolom> well it's still an issue. but I am quite happy with what happens:
[15:23:22] <agcolom> hold on.... I think I've just had an idea...
[15:24:08] <agcolom> I am right in thinking that custom selects are now based on popups?
[15:24:38] <agcolom> uGoMobi ^
[15:24:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes that's correct
[15:24:57] <agcolom> how about using origin ?
[15:25:08] <agcolom> (for custom selects)
[15:25:35] <agcolom> (just an idea)
[15:25:45] <agcolom> not if it might break something...
[15:26:04] <uGoMobi> the popup widget set the position to window after orientation change
[15:26:10] <agcolom> yes
[15:26:22] <uGoMobi> even if set to origin in the code
[15:26:36] <uGoMobi> i think that was to prevent jumping
[15:26:59] <agcolom> so if you have a scroll due to the orientation change, the custom select popup is not aligned with the origin but centered on hte page
[15:27:06] <uGoMobi> so it's probably not something that is easily changed
[15:27:43] <agcolom> but at the same time, having the custom select in hte middle is good because the user can't miss it...
[15:27:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that's the idea
[15:28:15] <agcolom> so I think this is a good solution...
[15:28:28] <agcolom> I'm happy to close that issue if you're happy too :-)
[15:28:31] <uGoMobi> even if there is a scroll... you will always be sure the popup / custom menu is on the screen
[15:28:54] <agcolom> exactly! That's much more important
[15:29:05] <agcolom> (IMO)
[15:29:29] <uGoMobi> there is a feature request to apply positionTo origin also after orientation change
[15:29:55] <uGoMobi> so maybe we will change it in a future release if we can make it work properly
[15:32:48] <agcolom> closed it :-) eh we're down 2 issues ;-) time for bed!
[15:33:02] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper :-)
[15:33:29] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[15:33:36] <uGoMobi> good night Anne!
[15:34:09] <agcolom> just before I go, how's Chrome doing now with transitions? (Still only fade working?)
[15:37:06] <agcolom> OMG Just upgraded to Chrome 21! transitions are working!!!! even the 3D ones!!!!!
[15:37:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom:  cool
[15:37:45] <agcolom> there are lots of issues opened about that!
[15:37:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I have to check on my old laptop
[15:38:14] <uGoMobi> on Windows / Chrome it didn't pass the 3D test
[15:38:47] <agcolom> oh shame!
[15:39:12] <uGoMobi> but we can always as people to test again
[15:39:35] <agcolom> well it's all fine in Chrome 21 Mac OSx
[15:39:45] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3680
[15:40:55] <uGoMobi> on my new laptop I don't see the issue either, but not sure that is because of other graphics card or a Chrome update
[15:40:55] <agcolom> yes, that's the one I was looking at :-)
[15:42:03] <uGoMobi> or a Windows update
[15:46:31] <agcolom> ok, I've commented on the issue... cool! definitely time for bed ;-)
[15:46:38] <agcolom> goodnight again Jasper :-)
[15:47:25] <uGoMobi> sleep well Anne
[15:48:47] <agcolom> thx, you too :-) btw I've also added the in review label so that we can go back to it easily...
[15:49:19] <uGoMobi> ok great
[15:49:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm struggling to get the reloadModule helper to work in ie9 :(
[15:50:03] <gseguin> johnbender: what's going on?
[15:50:05] <uGoMobi> johnbender: feeling better than yesterday ?
[15:52:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yes a bit
[15:52:22] <johnbender> uGoMobi: trying to work on testswarm
[15:52:29] <johnbender> gseguin: the deferred is never resolving
[15:52:36] <johnbender> that is the callback is never being called in the last requre
[15:53:12] <gseguin> sorry, father duty, be back later
[15:53:21] <johnbender> gseguin: np np
[16:06:44] <uGoMobi> johnbender: don't want to bother you but I am curious how it's possible that the select and listview tests all pass on browserstack IE9 but in testswarm both show 3 failures
[16:07:15] <uGoMobi> testswarm uses browserstack right?
[16:08:57] <uGoMobi> or maybe this is exactly what you are looking into and I should just shut up :)
[16:17:35] <uGoMobi> i am off... have a good weekend all!
