[05:57:14] <Wilto> Morning, bros and ladybros.

[08:29:15] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3829 on jquery-mobile (scorrin; 12h, 10m ago): Blackberry - Fixed Position Toolbars Not Working - JQM 1.1.0-rc.1
[09:01:33] <gseguin> good morning
[09:10:24] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #952: STILL FAILING in 1 hr 28 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/952/

[09:21:16] <johnbender> that one's a server issue

[10:39:22] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I implemented the changePage intervention via the popupStack, and, believe it or not, I didn't need to setTimeout!
[10:39:37] <gseguin> oh really?
[10:39:40] <gseguin> nice!
[10:39:52] <gseguin> how did you do it?
[10:41:33] <gseguin> oh got the PR... looking
[10:42:27] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think it's because I use window.history.back() to get rid of the popups, and when the hashchange callback gets called, I re-issue the pagechange right away.
[10:43:53] <_|Nix|_> I'm actually kinda wondering if there's a signal when the user hits refresh and before the page is reloaded - like pagebeforerefresh, or something, because this same remove-all-popups-from-the-screen-before-changing-the-page could be useful then as well.
[10:44:28] <_|Nix|_> Otherwise if you 1. bring up a popup and 2. refresh, you have an additional history entry which is useless.
[10:47:57] <gseguin> we could install a pagebeforechange handler that cleans up the url on the first changePage, what do you think?
[10:51:01] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Do we get a pagebeforechange when the user refreshes?
[10:51:48] <gseguin> after it loads yes
[10:52:44] <kinblas> jzaefferer: FYI, I did some testing and it looks like things are broken on iPhone because it *ALWAYS* applies the landscape media query
[10:52:53] <kinblas> I did a few test cases that show this ... no JS involved
[10:58:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: After it loads may be too late, because the history may already be oldpage -> popup1 -> popup2 -> newpage ...
[10:58:52] <_|Nix|_> Oh, wait ... I see ...
[10:59:51] <_|Nix|_> Although if, upon refresh we start doing window.history.back(), we're gonna get the old version of the page the user has just refreshed ... not good.
[11:03:27] <jzaefferer> kinblas: bah, silly iPhone :/
[11:08:23] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: you're right, I don't see a way to get rid of that history
[11:08:36] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: pushstate may let you do that
[11:08:52] * gseguin steps into unknown territory
[11:09:34] <Wilto> AW SHEEIT, new iPad time up in hurr.
[11:09:51] <kinblas> jazefferer: if you want I'll post the URL to my tests
[11:10:29] <gseguin> rrrrr: Wilto, I'm still impatiently waiting for FedEx to show up
[11:13:49] <kinblas> jzaefferer: my tests are here http://goo.gl/ZoQ4u
[11:16:16] <jzaefferer> kinblas: thanks. Don't have much to contribute to that, don't really know enough media queries. Is there a ticket already? Seems like you've got more background info to file that properly
[11:16:36] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah ... dialogs mess up the history the same way ...
[11:16:42] <kinblas> jzaefferer: yeah I'll file a ticket with Apple
[11:17:25] <jzaefferer> oh, okay
[11:17:39] <jzaefferer> was thinking of one in jQuery Mobile, but for the long-term, Apple makes more sense
[11:25:31] <johnbender> In case anyone is wondering where I've been I'm sorting out some issues with the selenium ci build
[11:25:40] <johnbender> good ol' selenium web driver
[11:25:43] * johnbender sighs
[11:29:28] <johnbender> and I have to take my daughter to the doctors office so it'll likely be finished after that
[11:29:43] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I'm hoping to set up the rest of the test swarm build today
[11:30:12] <jzaefferer> johnbender: cool
[11:35:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Forgot to remove the pagebeforechange handler before ... fixed and pushed now ...
[11:44:17] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: k, I'll try to give it a try over the weekend
[11:44:30] <gseguin> today I'm on Jive assignements
[12:53:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Roger.
[12:54:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/_3IHjA
[12:54:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Addresses #3802 - Improves documentation for custom-width switches. - Mat Marquis
[12:54:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Typo in previous documentation update. - Mat Marquis
[12:54:28] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] This admittedly silly fix seems to solve a number of bizarre problems on Android 2.3, all of which pretain to (empty) absolute positioned elements inside of fixed elements—in this case, absolute positioned icons in buttons in fixed headers—breaking user interaction with elements elsewhere on the page. Most notably, this issue was causing select menus to be either completely unresponsive, or only respond foll
[12:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Shouldn't this reference jQuery as jQuery, not $? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.vmouse.js#L21
[12:57:21] <Wilto> ⌘Q ⌘Q ⌘Q
[13:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> And on a related note, is this a valid require shim? function define() { [].pop.call( arguments )(); }
[13:01:28] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: no the "jquery" module returns jQuery
[13:01:57] <gseguin> so $ is jQuery
[13:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: But the parameter is named $, shouldn't it be jQuery?
[13:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> The closure immediately inside the define expects it to be jQuery
[13:02:29] <gseguin> oh I see
[13:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> The closure is correct, since it's written for use outside of require.
[13:03:41] <scott_gonzalez> I guess there are no pages that actually use require() to load all dependencies :-P
[13:03:51] <gseguin> yes you're right, though in the end it doesn't really matter since this gets stripped at build time
[13:05:20] <gseguin> I guess we missed it because because at the beginning we were thinking of getting rid of that internal closure
[13:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> So it's probably wrong in all the files?
[13:05:56] <gseguin> indeed
[13:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:06:12] <gseguin> good catch
[13:06:57] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I'm using individual files from jQuery Mobile.
[13:07:44] <gseguin> with AMD or without?
[13:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> without
[13:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> I put this before my script includes: function define() { [].pop.call( arguments )(); }
[13:15:30] <gseguin> yeah that's a good shim but then you're responsible to add the modules in the right order
[13:23:30] <Wilto> johnbender: Leave us never speak of this Android bug again.
[13:23:42] <Wilto> Y’know. After the docs are updated.
[13:42:48] <johnbender> Wilto: you'll hear no complaining from me
[13:43:03] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: It looks like gseguin answered your questions?
[13:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:43:22] <johnbender> frio frijoles
[14:05:02] <toddparker> hey bender - have you had any luck getting phone gap working?
[14:05:14] <toddparker> mine was good yesterday but now it dies
[14:05:21] <toddparker> i want to test the transitions
[14:05:35] <toddparker> tho you don't have iOS anyway, right?

[14:12:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3712 on jquery-mobile (felipegs; 2w, 19h ago): Select on Android 2.2/2.3 not working with fixed positioning
[14:12:15] <johnbender> toddparker: right
[14:12:20] <johnbender> toddparker: I have an emulator
[14:12:29] <johnbender> but not a phone
[14:14:06] <johnbender> toddparker: wrt to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2605#issuecomment-4544727
[14:14:07] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2605 on jquery-mobile (jterhune; 5m, 1w ago): Unwanted automatic page change from link with data-ajax="false"
[14:14:20] <johnbender> it's the same note we have in there now *i think*
[14:14:24] <johnbender> let me go double check
[14:14:47] <johnbender> yah
[14:14:52] <johnbender> we have a big warning block in there
[14:18:37] <johnbender> gseguin: did you and dave get that patch in to address the href monkeying?
[14:18:50] <johnbender> there's an issue that was just logged that I think is caused by it
[14:19:07] <johnbender> and i'm going to recommend that he try the latest for mobile and 1.7.2 rc
[14:32:28] <johnbender> Wilto: well, your alterations to add white space have broken the tests but only on certain platforms lol
[14:32:37] <johnbender> there are a couple that need whitespace stripping
[14:32:42] <johnbender> I'm on it
[14:33:03] <gseguin> johnbender: the issue we were working on with Dave was more about being able to get the same order of execution when running in 1.7.2
[14:33:18] <johnbender> gseguin: ah, so we didn't address the href monkeying?
[14:33:26] <johnbender> I'm pretty sure that's why that guy is seeting that
[14:33:28] <johnbender> *seeing that
[14:33:29] <gseguin> but the href monkeying I think is here to stay until we find a way around it
[14:33:34] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[14:33:40] <johnbender> gseguin: maybe you should comment then
[14:33:52] <johnbender> maybe if he does his bindings in the right order or some such
[14:34:00] * johnbender is cluelesss
[14:34:03] <johnbender> -s
[14:39:14] <Wilto> SON OF A
[14:39:27] <Wilto> Oh, I added a nbsp in icons, johnbender.
[14:39:29] <Wilto> I KNOW.
[14:39:37] <johnbender> lol
[14:39:53] <johnbender> Wilto: $.trim() seems to set it right
[14:40:01] <Wilto> ♬ Like it’s nineteen ninety nine. ♬
[14:40:12] <Wilto> Cool, cool.
[14:40:21] <Wilto> Thanks, dude. I should’ve checked the test; I’m fried today.
[14:41:51] <johnbender> no worries
[14:41:53] <johnbender> easy fix

[14:45:50] <Wilto> do you see that transition/opacity thing
[14:45:57] <Wilto> look right at that sentence
[14:46:03] <Wilto> let that seep right into your eyeballs
