[03:57:02] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Ping
[04:04:59] <uGoMobi> MauriceG:  pong
[04:05:31] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: HI!  Nice to see you !! :-)
[04:05:43] <uGoMobi> hi Maurice
[04:05:51] <uGoMobi> how r u?
[04:06:19] <MauriceG> Thanks! I'm fine.  And you? Hope not too much work!
[04:06:47] <uGoMobi> bit busy but it's ok
[04:07:33] <uGoMobi> couldn't spend much time on JQM though lately :(
[04:07:45] <uGoMobi> you saw the issue count... 370
[04:07:53] <MauriceG> Yes, I saw...
[04:07:56] <uGoMobi> :(
[04:08:24] <MauriceG> come on... not so bad
[04:08:56] <uGoMobi> it's normal with a new release there is more activity
[04:09:05] <uGoMobi> but still
[04:09:36] <MauriceG> so let's take a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4899
[04:09:54] <uGoMobi> yeah i saw that one
[04:09:59] <MauriceG> it seems the docs are wrong
[04:10:39] <uGoMobi> normally the widget factory use a regex and it doesn't matter if it's lower upper or camel case
[04:11:10] <MauriceG> but, another one is, that  $.mobile.collapsibleset.prototype.options.iconPos   does not work all
[04:11:27] <uGoMobi> yeah
[04:11:49] <uGoMobi> the collapsible widget needs to be improved
[04:12:08] <uGoMobi> there is inconsistency between widget how we handle options
[04:13:43] <uGoMobi> actually we have to check all current widgets to see if all ways to set an option works
[04:13:59] <uGoMobi> you noticed the same for the listview widget right?
[04:15:31] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: what do you mean?
[04:16:04] <uGoMobi> i believe it were the options related that split button didn't work correctly
[04:16:23] <uGoMobi> related to*
[04:16:27] <uGoMobi> i thought you mentioned something like that
[04:17:20] <uGoMobi> or maybe it was overriding those options that doesn't work as expected
[04:18:30] <MauriceG> one thing: prototype options are all case sensitive: $.mobile.listview.prototype.options.dividertheme is not  $.mobile.listview.prototype.options.dividerTheme
[04:21:35] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4371
[04:22:33] <uGoMobi> that PR was about with/without dash
[04:23:16] <uGoMobi> I thought it wasn't case sensitive either, but I am probably wrong about that
[04:25:24] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: did you try to fix iconPos for collapsibles?
[04:25:56] <MauriceG> no, I think, we have to change to docs for "iconPos"
[04:27:53] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ok, lets change the docs for now
[04:28:49] <uGoMobi> I will take a look at  $.mobile.collapsibleset.prototype.options.iconPos later
[04:29:05] <uGoMobi> that shouldn't be to hard to fix
[04:29:33] <MauriceG> and what's about iconPos for collapsible sets ?
[04:30:10] <uGoMobi> that should be consistent with collapsible
[04:31:00] <uGoMobi> did you test collapsedIcon and expandedIcon?
[04:31:56] <MauriceG> iconPos for sets are not working at all: http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/SrxGy/
[04:32:24] <MauriceG> I have to go out for 10 minutes ...
[04:32:57] <uGoMobi> I see, then lets wait a moment with the docs and first fix this
[04:38:28] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I am going to work at popup/Android issues first
[04:38:41] <uGoMobi> but I can give this a look tomorrow
[04:38:56] <uGoMobi> if you have a fix in the meantime let me know
[04:45:46] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: okay. I will take a look.  Thanks for your time!
[07:08:30] <toddparker> hi all - sorry i hopped off yesterday. offsite meeting.
[07:10:37] <toddparker> so where are we at?
[07:19:46] <uGoMobi> hi toddparker
[07:20:17] <uGoMobi> i finally managed to setup remote debugging for android
[07:20:27] <uGoMobi> so i am taking full advantage of that
[07:21:35] <MauriceG> Hi toddparker
[07:22:33] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  none of the collapsible-set prototype options seem to work :-(
[07:23:07] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I see :(
[07:30:53] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/SrxGy/
[07:57:32] <uGoMobi> toddparker: do you still see this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3973 ?
[08:03:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Xt8NOA
[08:03:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Navbar: Fixes #4663 - Persistent navbar broken on scroll, Chrome for android. Thanks @mmavko :+1: - Jasper de Groot
[08:11:18] <toddparker> uGoMobi: let me test that
[08:11:27] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok
[08:12:20] <uGoMobi> toddparker: do you know the status on that z-index issue?
[08:12:35] <uGoMobi> Wilto was working on that right?
[08:12:43] <Wilto> Still hammering on it.
[08:12:58] <Wilto> I was really hoping some CSS voodoo would solve it, but it’s not looking that way.
[08:13:01] <uGoMobi> hey Wilto
[08:13:02] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:13:14] <Wilto> As far as the animation issue… all I’ve got is “remove the fade animation from the overlay.”
[08:13:27] <Wilto> The one where it’s broken in conjunction with position: fixed, I got nothin’.
[08:13:38] <uGoMobi> what exactly is the animation issue?
[08:14:26] <Wilto> Animating the opacity of the overlay breaks the “z-index”.
[08:14:37] <uGoMobi> ok clear
[08:15:08] <uGoMobi> I am going to give that I try now
[08:15:59] <Wilto> Try what now?
[08:16:52] <toddparker> uGoMobi: ok, just tested and it's fine
[08:16:53] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3973
[08:17:01] <toddparker> I cannot reproduce on our Android 4.0.4 phone, default browser or Chrome here:
[08:17:02] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/footer-persist-a.html
[08:17:16] <uGoMobi> Wilto: just see if I can think of another fix for the z-index issue
[08:17:36] <toddparker> so wilt, if we remove the fade in/out on the overlay, it fixes it?
[08:17:42] <toddparker> Wilto, sorry :)
[08:18:00] <toddparker> i've been saying i'd like to nix that anyway jus to sped things up
[08:18:10] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok, shall we close 3973?
[08:18:26] <toddparker> i think we can uGoMobi, was going to suggest that
[08:19:33] <uGoMobi> Wilto: toddparker then let's nix that fade
[08:19:45] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, I’m totally into scrapping the fade.
[08:20:19] <Wilto> Thing is, this fixed issue is pretty much the same deal. I’m wondering if a structural change might fix both.
[08:20:36] <Wilto> I’m reluctant to change markup, but if we’re gonna do it we should do it now.
[08:21:27] <uGoMobi> right
[08:22:03] <Wilto> I like to think that I’m pretty good about mysterious CSS fixes, and I’ve got nothin’ on this one.
[08:25:13] <Wilto> So, like johnbender and I were talking about yesterday: I’m wondering about having the popups as a child of the overlay.
[08:27:02] <Wilto> Wat’chu think.
[08:27:41] <uGoMobi> I am in favor
[08:27:59] <uGoMobi> any downsides?
[08:28:08] <Wilto> The other option is to capitalize on this opacity animation bug and use that to impact the stacking order of the popup, but it’s clunky.
[08:28:22] <Wilto> Clunky both in appearance and in code.
[08:29:13] <Wilto> None that I can see, apart from being unable to specify fade and such on the overlay without having it impact the popup itself.
[08:29:20] <uGoMobi> hmm... making the child of the overlay sounds better
[08:29:27] <Wilto> +1
[08:29:31] <uGoMobi> we reuse the overlay now right
[08:30:09] <uGoMobi> i mean... one ui-popup-screen for all popups on page
[08:30:23] <Wilto> We still got a bunch of screens in play, on the `popup-simple` branch.
[08:30:33] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[08:32:06] <Wilto> We do have the `one-overlay-for-all-popups` branch.
[08:33:23] <uGoMobi> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4844
[08:33:41] <uGoMobi> that one is not on Chrome but Android native browser
[08:33:52] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, this is Android native.
[08:34:18] <uGoMobi> I thought it was mostly Chrome on ICS
[08:35:19] <uGoMobi> anyway... I am going to try the "make them child" approach on the one-overlay-for-all-popups" branch
[08:35:32] <Wilto> SOLD.
[08:35:57] <Wilto> cc todd
[08:36:03] <Wilto> Ahem. toddparker.
[08:36:06] <uGoMobi> maybe new branch... one-overlay-for-all-popups-and-make-them-child-of-overlay
[08:36:16] <uGoMobi> :)
[08:36:28] <Wilto> one-overlay-for-all-popups-and-make-them-child-of-overlay-because-of-android-THANKS-AGAIN-ANDROID
[08:36:56] <toddparker> catching up
[08:37:00] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:37:13] <toddparker> so i thought the singleton overlay was a post 1.2 thing
[08:37:25] <uGoMobi> Wilto I think johnbender was saying something about scrolling too
[08:37:36] <uGoMobi> I just see this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4898
[08:37:47] <Wilto> Yeeeah… the scrolling is a separate thing; I don’t want to worry about that too much just yet.
[08:37:53] <toddparker> if we make the popup a child of the overlay, that means you can't use opacity for the overlay, rgba only?
[08:38:43] <uGoMobi> toddparker: because opacity is inherited you mean?
[08:39:17] <Wilto> Ah, yeah.
[08:41:21] <Wilto> Todd got an idea.
[08:41:28] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Belay all orders; one second.
[08:41:44] <toddparker> yeah, wilt and i were just talking
[08:41:48] <toddparker> 2 issues:
[08:42:07] <toddparker> 1. animating the opacity messes with z-index >> don't animate
[08:43:08] <toddparker> 2. position:fixed element messes with z-index >>  add in a class override when the popup opens to negate this CSS property. toolbars will hide if scrolled, but this sidesteps the issue
[08:57:07] <toddparker> the 3rd thing I want wilt to look at today is limiting the overlay and scrolling to just be the size of the viewport or the height of the popup+tolerances, whichever is larger
[08:57:16] <toddparker> this will speed up the opening of popups on longer pages
[08:58:50] <uGoMobi> toddparker: that should also fix this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4898
[09:00:45] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #33: STILL FAILING in 8 min 18 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/33/
[09:02:54] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i see, yes. we need to measure the height of the popup and set the overlay to that height if it's larger than the viewport or page
[09:04:24] <toddparker> add it to Wilto's pile
[09:04:28] <uGoMobi> toddparker: so it will first get viewport height and when the popup is opened we check if it needs to be adjusted
[09:04:43] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/grumble.jpg
[09:15:18] <Wilto> Alright, I’m on it. Dibs on `popup-simple` for a couple hours.
[09:16:25] <uGoMobi> good luck, let me know if I can do something
[09:21:26] <uGoMobi> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4663
[09:22:01] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I committed the CSS overflow visible fix... shall we revert https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/dea9d31ed7950d435b90458d3be72c025106d058 ?
[09:25:04] <toddparker> johnbender: that fix seemed to make the persistent toolbar work so i'd say no. that was the fix, right?
[09:25:52] <toddparker> oh, i see. uGoMobi landed the css change
[09:26:07] <toddparker> i guess we should revert and see if just css will work
[09:26:11] <uGoMobi> toddparker: the CSS fix is replacement for JS fix
[09:26:31] <toddparker> yeah, sorry, had to re-read
[09:26:33] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I already tested that, it does work
[09:26:35] <uGoMobi> np
[09:27:08] <uGoMobi> I could only test on 4.0.4.
[09:27:12] <toddparker> uGoMobi: you tested 4.1 with the js change pulled out and it was still ok? if so, then let's revert johnbender
[09:27:27] <uGoMobi> I can't install Chrome on Android SDK so I couldn't test on that
[09:27:44] <toddparker> in 4.1, chrome is the default browser
[09:27:57] <uGoMobi> toddparker: no I tested 4.0.4.
[09:28:02] <toddparker> wilt can test if neither of you have devices
[09:28:14] <uGoMobi> just to be sure we can test on JB as well
[09:28:19] <toddparker> Wilto, sheesh
[09:28:27] <toddparker> think autocorrect is getting me each time
[09:28:56] <uGoMobi> I just got a new device (Galaxy Nexus) but don't want to switch to JB yet
[09:29:03] <uGoMobi> first want to work on the ICS issues
[09:29:37] <toddparker> uGoMobi: gotcha, good idea
[09:32:26] <toddparker> if you guys can give me a short url with the css fix in but the js reverted, i can test here too
[09:35:10] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4874
[09:35:11] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4844
[09:35:35] <johnbender> toddparker: have you guys tried the popups in ie
[09:35:35] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4816
[09:35:39] <toddparker> so many popup ics issues
[09:35:40] <johnbender> worked well for me
[09:36:00] <toddparker> i've tried wp7
[09:36:00] <uGoMobi> johnbender: which IE?
[09:36:06] <toddparker> i can run thru all IEs
[09:36:09] <johnbender> wp7
[09:36:28] <toddparker> or 7.5
[09:36:47] <uGoMobi> css issues you mean?
[09:37:54] <toddparker> testing IE now in browserstack
[09:38:36] <toddparker> IE7 is fine except for the scrolling
[09:39:04] <toddparker> johnbender: where are you at with kicking IE/WP out of the history stuff?
[09:40:19] <toddparker> IE8 is fine
[09:40:49] <uGoMobi> I think I saw some css issues on IE7 in the menu examples
[09:40:51] <toddparker> IE9 looks good
[09:40:51] <johnbender> toddparker: it's done
[09:40:55] <toddparker> ?
[09:41:00] <johnbender> toddparker: needs testing
[09:41:09] <toddparker> in master or a branch?
[09:41:31] <uGoMobi> on WP emulator I only saw the jumping and non working links issue
[09:41:57] <johnbender> toddparker: popup-simple
[09:42:02] <toddparker> ah, branch
[09:42:08] <johnbender> toddparker: and any ie that passes our browser check gets opted out of histsory
[09:42:44] <johnbender> toddparker: all my changes are in popup-simple
[09:42:49] <toddparker> re-checking that branch now
[09:43:10] <johnbender> toddparker: it may be that we only want to opt out certain version of ie but right now everything except 10 is opted in
[09:43:13] <johnbender> haven't tested on 10
[09:44:03] <toddparker> IE7 works good on http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-simple/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[09:44:08] <johnbender> toddparker: bam
[09:44:10] <johnbender> :)
[09:44:14] <toddparker> css is lacking, but that's not our issue
[09:44:59] <johnbender> total lines of code to prevent history is like 20
[09:45:08] <johnbender> that's generous
[09:45:17] <johnbender> it's probably less
[09:45:40] <johnbender> toddparker: the history option is in the docs too
[09:45:48] <johnbender> not sure if we should change the name or not
[09:47:52] <uGoMobi> johnbender: nice fix... all looks good to me on WP
[09:51:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: well it wasn't my idea
[09:51:51] <johnbender> I just implemented it
[09:52:00] <uGoMobi> still nice fix
[09:54:16] <johnbender> thanks :)
[09:56:57] <toddparker> yeah, i think this looks solid johnbender
[09:57:17] <toddparker> we should only kick out versions of IE from 9 and below
[09:57:23] <toddparker> IE 10 is solid
[09:57:27] <toddparker> supposedly
[09:57:43] <toddparker> other than that, any reservations to landing this so it gets more testing
[09:57:44] <johnbender> toddparker: yah thats what our IE check is now
[09:57:55] <johnbender> toddparker: we should actually rename it to oldIE
[09:58:20] <johnbender> toddparker: I don't have any but I guess it would be good to let Wilto continue his futzing if he's already pushing commits?
[09:58:32] <johnbender> toddparker: I've tested it a bunch so if you guys are happy I'm game
[10:00:22] <toddparker> yes - oldIE is perfect
[10:01:22] <toddparker> Wilto is working in popup simple too so we can have him add his stuff, we'll test later today and then push it all if it checks out
[10:02:51] <Wilto> oh hello
[10:03:39] <Wilto> Am I staying the course here?
[10:04:57] <Wilto> “FIGMO” it is.
[10:08:16] <johnbender> toddparker: brilliant
[10:18:41] <johnbender> Wilto: just made a small tweak to _destroy in the popup
[10:18:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to popup-simple: http://git.io/oMhdQQ
[10:18:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-simple] make sure the popup is closed on destroy (including cleanup) - John Bender
[10:18:47] <johnbender> Wilto: you might want to rebase your changes
[10:18:55] <Wilto> NOOOOOkay
[10:19:37] <johnbender> Wilto: there shouldn't be any conflicts it was a 2 liner
[10:21:32] <johnbender> toddparker: once we land this change I'll switch it over to oldIE and close that pull request to support ie 10 with the browser check

[11:18:26] <Wilto> oh man things are broken
[11:21:17] <Wilto> So, I got some chaos following a rebase, johnbender.
[11:21:36] <Wilto> oh, whoop, nevermind. I’m making a mess of things.
[12:14:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 3 new commits to popup-simple: http://git.io/gWANIg
[12:14:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-simple] A negative indent of -99999em can cause native Android 4.x to freak out, since it’s so absurdly high. Switched to -9999px. - Mat Marquis

[12:15:27] <Wilto> Grabbing lunch; back soon.
[12:21:20] <johnbender> Wilto: we should be passing a reference to the page to the widget
[12:21:28] <johnbender> so we can avoid finding it with closest
[12:21:29] <johnbender> one sec
[12:25:24] <johnbender> not an obvious fix
[12:25:25] <johnbender> :/
[12:25:26] <johnbender> hmm
[12:30:05] <johnbender> Wilto: yah we're finding the closest page everywhere
[12:30:09] <johnbender> hmm
[12:35:46] <Wilto> yeeeah
[12:36:07] <johnbender> Wilto: ok I'm storing the parent page in create
[12:36:10] <johnbender> it's gotten there as well
[12:36:11] <Wilto> I just wanted to get it posted up for discussion, but that did creep me out. It’s happening in a few places.
[12:36:12] <Wilto> Sweet.
[12:36:19] <johnbender> but
[12:36:40] <johnbender> if we switch it to one popup for many pages that will have to change
[12:37:02] <Wilto> Eh, we’ll set that bridge on fire when we come to it.
[12:39:41] <Wilto> I just worry that this fix is the kinda thing where we’re gonna get bugs saying “my toolbars disappear when I trigger a popup and I don’t know why.”
[12:40:17] <Wilto> It’d be better if we pulled in some of the transition-y hiding from the fixed plugin, but that’s a bit too much duplication/cross-pollination for me.
[12:40:53] <Wilto> “Better” meaning “more intentional-looking.”
[12:41:33] <johnbender> Wilto: did you write tests for the class addition on open?
[12:41:39] <johnbender> if not I'll just hack one in real quick
[12:41:41] <Wilto> … cough …
[12:41:54] <johnbender> :)
[12:42:34] <Wilto> I dunno; I wasn’t 100% sold on it as a fix, but we gotta do somethin’.
[13:12:42] <johnbender> Wilto: something broke the tests in the last two commits
[13:14:17] <johnbender> something to do with the default fade
[13:35:34] <johnbender> Wilto: I think the animate complete callbacks aren't firing when we remove the default fade
[13:35:42] <Wilto> Ah hell.
[13:35:45] <johnbender> so our post open events won't fire all the time
[13:35:46] <Wilto> I should’ve caught that.
[13:35:49] <johnbender> still trying to figure that out
[13:36:06] <johnbender> Wilto: does that make sense?
[13:36:36] <johnbender> it seems like the expectation is that there's some transition ethere
[13:36:37] <johnbender> *there
[13:37:34] <johnbender> Wilto: will you be ablt to look at it or should I?
[13:37:39] <Wilto> Yeah, I got it.
[13:37:54] <johnbender> Wilto: thanks, I've been trying to get Kin and Dave together and I think I might have missed my change
[13:37:56] <johnbender> *chance
[13:37:57] <johnbender> gotta see
[13:38:22] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm here
[13:38:30] <johnbender> kinblas: cool
[13:38:34] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: you around?
[13:38:46] <DaveMethvin> just a sec
[13:38:51] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I should say I don't have code, other than checking out pre 1.0
[13:39:50] <johnbender> kinblas: side note
[13:39:55] <johnbender> alot of attr has snuck back in :(
[13:40:20] <kinblas> into?
[13:40:27] <johnbender> button makrup
[13:40:29] <johnbender> *markup
[13:40:34] <johnbender> I was looking at a diff with master
[13:40:40] <kinblas> ah
[13:40:58] <kinblas> johnbender: heh, might want to check perf on something like WP 7.5
[13:41:04] <johnbender> I had to double check that that diff made sense but if you look at buttonMarkup on master there are a couple attr calls
[13:41:07] <johnbender> sigh
[13:41:18] <johnbender> kinblas: perf regression suite coming in 1.4
[13:41:22] <Wilto> —wat
[13:41:26] <DaveMethvin> sup guyz
[13:41:36] <johnbender> one sec
[13:41:51] <Wilto> WHO TOUCHED BUTTONMARKUP
[13:41:55] <johnbender> lol
[13:42:01] <Wilto> Put a dollar in the jar, whomever you are.
[13:42:01] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: so I talked with Kin
[13:42:15] <uGoMobi> i didn't touch any button
[13:42:15] <johnbender> calling him to the stand here on dom manip methods as a bottleneck
[13:42:24] <uGoMobi> no buttonMarkup either
[13:42:39] * DaveMethvin looks for bible to swear kinblas in
[13:42:42] <johnbender> lol
[13:42:44] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:42:48] * kinblas raises his hand
[13:43:23] <Wilto> ?OBJECTION
[13:43:24] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/objection.jpg
[13:43:42] <DaveMethvin> so do you hve a benchmark?
[13:43:52] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: no, but we did
[13:44:02] <DaveMethvin> but you eated it?
[13:44:06] <toddparker> let's do some git blamin'
[13:44:13] <DaveMethvin> yeeee  haw
[13:44:14] <toddparker> dog did.
[13:44:31] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: we'd have to go data spelunking to retrieve the data
[13:44:35] <johnbender> err perf data
[13:44:35] <DaveMethvin> i just love running code through profiler
[13:44:42] <johnbender> I don't think it exists in our little sqlite db
[13:45:00] <DaveMethvin> find me a little demo page that creates some decent number of buttons or whatever
[13:45:12] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: we still have the demo page
[13:45:32] <johnbender> kinblas: the one other thing I wanted to talk about was how the performance differed between mobile and desktop in terms of profiling
[13:45:33] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: we used pre-1.0, the 400-listview page as well as the form-gallery page
[13:45:51] <DaveMethvin> i think i saw that one
[13:46:07] <DaveMethvin> on the profiling
[13:46:18] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: the primary issue was actuall function calls
[13:46:21] <kinblas> johnbender: it was hard to measure anything on desktop because the computers I have are developer grade
[13:46:23] <johnbender> *actually function calls
[13:46:27] <Wilto> tests/functional/button-markup.html
[13:46:38] <DaveMethvin> my assertion would be that the call counts are about the same, the rendering and execution times may not be
[13:46:47] <DaveMethvin> and that will often get you into a ballpark
[13:47:11] <DaveMethvin> also, if rendering is bad on desktop it is probably worse on mobile, which means you're not stuck on dom manip
[13:47:15] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: what do you mean "the call counts are the same"
[13:47:25] <johnbender> ahh
[13:47:28] <johnbender> between desktop and mobile
[13:47:29] <DaveMethvin> you made 1342 calls to .attr() or whatever
[13:47:44] <DaveMethvin> i mean it can change a bit based on feature detects etc
[13:47:59] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: the call counts of desktop versus mobile varied but for more modern devices they were close
[13:48:11] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: variations also had to do with sizzle use or not
[13:48:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah if you can't use queryselectorall that's gonna leave a mark
[13:48:48] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: specifically I was hoping to talk about the overhead in using attr
[13:49:56] <DaveMethvin> just for a general ballpark, last i looked it was about 100x slower to say $(this).is(":checked") than this.checked
[13:50:14] <DaveMethvin> but there is no reason for us to burn time making the former fast when people should use the latter
[13:50:31] <DaveMethvin> we'll never make it that much faster
[13:50:58] <DaveMethvin> so there are very good reasons to use the native stuff when it's appropriate and you're experiencing a bottleneck
[13:51:16] <DaveMethvin> hey, let me get a couple of commits pushed and close some tix, probably about 15 minutes?
[13:51:23] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: http://jquerymobile.com/speed/lists-ul-record.php
[13:54:27] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: sure
[14:09:00] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: not sure what you'll see but on my end it looks like we're spending a lot of time with .data
[14:09:03] <johnbender> kinblas: ^
[14:09:07] <johnbender> I recall having that discussion as well
[14:10:35] <johnbender> thought there's a reason for that :/
[14:10:42] <kinblas> johnbender: there were a couple of things I remember there ... we should be calling $.data() instead of $.fn.data()
[14:11:03] <kinblas> and the camel-casing that gets done needs to be cached in a dictionary instead of being done *EVERY* time
[14:12:21] <kinblas> johnbender: for the 2 particular test cases, I remember getting it down to the point where it was like a death of a thousand paper-cuts
[14:21:34] <Wilto> Who used “open-xyzzy-popup” as an ID in the popup unit tests. Step forward and shake my hand.
[14:22:37] <toddparker> now THAT'S unique
[14:22:44] <toddparker> how goes the battle?
[14:22:57] <Wilto> Nobody is gonna sneak a videogame reference past me.
[14:24:16] <DaveMethvin> kinblas johnbender okay
[14:24:38] <DaveMethvin> so i see a lot of time spent in data and trigger
[14:28:24] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: so there's two parts to that
[14:28:26] <johnbender> the first
[14:28:29] <johnbender> is that we're being bad actor
[14:28:33] <johnbender> actors
[14:28:39] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js#L25
[14:28:47] * johnbender claws out his eyes
[14:29:11] <johnbender> I'm creating a branch right now to see if getting the data up front and doing dot access there would be faster
[14:29:49] <johnbender> but I think $.data is expensive
[14:30:01] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: let me clean that out and see if it's faster
[14:30:11] <johnbender> and then get back to you
[14:30:25] <DaveMethvin> ok
[14:30:29] <johnbender> if it remains a bottleneck we can then talk about a dumbed down $.data
[14:30:35] <johnbender> but right now it's just lame and it's muddying the waters :(
[14:30:36] <DaveMethvin> i gotta freshen up on what jqmData does
[14:30:51] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: it's just a wrapper to do the namespace normalization for our data attributes
[14:31:18] <johnbender> (we allow you to namespace all the data attributes the library depends on)
[14:32:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah, found it in .core
[14:35:34] <DaveMethvin> btw johnbender can you change that page to use the uncompressed source? It will make the profiling easier (at least for me)
[14:40:43] <DaveMethvin> wow, that's some complicated selector raight there http://wnd8.com/grab/e33fdf.png
[14:43:35] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: indeed
[14:43:53] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I can, but I would just build a local page that isn't maintained
[14:44:00] <johnbender> a failed attempt at keeping track of perf data
[14:44:19] <johnbender> <comma> that isn't maintained
[14:44:21] <johnbender> the link I sent
[14:51:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender created button-data-access (+1 new commit): http://git.io/wjkeKg
[14:51:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/button-data-access] reduce the calls to jqmData in button markup - John Bender
[15:01:56] <kinblas> johnbender: regarding your last commit above ... I seem to remember that we didn't implement the data() returns object case correctly in terms of the property names
[15:02:07] <kinblas> it added to the object being returned
[15:02:38] <kinblas> or did we? I remember having a discussion about that with gseguin over a year ago? Not sure if it was actually fixed
[15:04:13] <johnbender> kinblas: I think we punted
[15:04:17] <johnbender> because we didn't need it
[15:04:19] <johnbender> not sure though
[15:04:28] <johnbender> I'm just going to see if I've speed things up there
[15:04:38] <kinblas> johnbender: ok, just mentioning it since you used it in your patch
[15:08:49] <Wilto> fhdjksalfhdjsknoh hello
[15:10:05] <johnbender> kinblas: yah, just wanted to see what I could do ther
[15:10:09] <johnbender> kinblas: purely an experiment
[15:33:00] <toddparker> so wilt is going to keep working on popup tomorrow. lots to re-factor
[15:43:28] <johnbender> toddparker: yar :(
[15:44:41] <johnbender> kinblas: looks like we're spending a quarter of our time in $.fn.data
[15:44:47] <johnbender> on the test page at lest
[15:44:49] <johnbender> *least
[15:44:57] <johnbender> even after removing the other calls
[15:45:42] <kinblas> johnbender: that's pretty significant
[15:47:15] <kinblas> johnbender: this is just for page loading right?
[15:47:27] <johnbender> kinblas: yah on page load
[15:47:45] <kinblas> johnbender: the other big chunk of time is traversing around the doc inserting transformed widget markup
[15:47:47] <johnbender> kinblas: part of the problem is that we synchronize the data-ns-attrs with the js object data
[15:48:10] <kinblas> johnbender: right
[15:48:11] <johnbender> after reconciling those options with the options object
[15:48:16] <johnbender> :/
[16:07:22] <johnbender> kinblas: yah switching one of the calls to $.data cut the time in half
[16:07:35] <johnbender> 50ish ms to 20ishms
[16:07:39] <johnbender> 20ish ms
[16:10:26] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I've got to pull this together a bit but dropping down to $.data from $.fn.data cut the time we spend there in half
[16:10:42] <johnbender> according to the profile I ran in chrome
[16:11:30] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah I remember trying to switch us over to $.data() in some hot spots ... the fn.data stuff fires events which is what makes it slow
[16:16:51] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I'll try to set something up where you can profile the change yourself
