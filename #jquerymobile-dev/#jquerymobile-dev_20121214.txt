[06:58:03] <gseguin> I updated it
[06:58:54] <uGoMobi> gseguin: hey! ok let's merge... I can always pimp the demo with some CSS later
[06:58:56] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[06:59:09] <gseguin> a'right
[06:59:19] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I will add a link on the demo index page

[06:59:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: wow... triage thunder! nice :)
[06:59:48] <gseguin> I already did
[06:59:53] <uGoMobi> lol

[07:01:50] <uGoMobi> bot is slacker
[07:01:57] <uGoMobi> right
[07:02:07] <arschmitz> probably out for coffee
[07:02:13] <gseguin> heh :)
[07:02:34] <arschmitz> never even brings any back for us
[07:02:54] <gseguin> yeah that bot has no manners
[07:03:47] <gseguin> any of you guys going to JSConf this year?
[07:03:55] <gseguin> or next year I should say
[07:04:47] <arschmitz> i wish but no
[07:05:29] <uGoMobi> gseguin: no
[07:05:30] <gseguin> am I going to be the only jQMobro over there?
[07:06:58] <uGoMobi> yeah I think so
[07:07:04] <uGoMobi> don't know about johnbender 
[07:07:12] <gseguin> gosh darn it!
[07:07:56] <uGoMobi> gseguin: shall we add a line above that autocomplate demo that says it looks for cities ?
[07:08:14] <gseguin> that sounds like a good clue
[07:08:15] <uGoMobi> and it starts filtering after entering 3 characters
[07:08:22] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:08:24] <arschmitz> @gseguin i would love to go but cant afford the ticket price!
[07:08:46] <arschmitz> doh too many git hub isues this morning throwing @'s around lol
[07:09:11] <gseguin> arschmitz: it's not much for what you get I think
[07:09:13] <uGoMobi> I understand @arschmitz
[07:09:18] <arschmitz> lol
[07:09:37] <gseguin> but yeah I understand it's not easy when it comes out of your pocket
[07:10:46] <arschmitz> yup
[07:11:07] <arschmitz> cheaper conf's i can some times get my employer to pay for but def not that one lol
[07:14:46] <toddmparker> arschmitz: you are kicking some arse on the tracker this morning
[07:15:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thanks clearing out some old stuff
[07:15:32] <arschmitz> asking for updates so we can close when they most likely never respond lol
[07:19:28] <arschmitz> WOW someone just broke github!
[07:20:16] <uGoMobi> still working here
[07:20:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: morning! you have a MBP retina right?
[07:22:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://i.imgur.com/zucUc.png
[07:23:11] <toddmparker> dang. good github uses PE
[07:23:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks like not all resources were loaded
[07:23:26] <arschmitz> ah looks like they fixed it it happened on multiple devices
[07:23:26] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yep.
[07:23:35] <toddmparker> megapixels up in here
[07:23:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: was wondering how the images of that swipe page demo look on it because I used 2048x1536 images with very high compression
[07:23:59] <uGoMobi> like that "Netvlies" site blog post
[07:24:10] <toddmparker> that's my jam. i like that approach
[07:24:13] <toddmparker> lemme look
[07:24:57] <toddmparker> whoops, closed the IRC window by accident
[07:26:19] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: images look ok. little soft/compressed but it' snot bad at all
[07:26:50] <toddmparker> testing these pages: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/swipe/sl.html
[07:27:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ah ok, I have to read a bit more about the different ways of compressing jpeg
[07:28:47] <uGoMobi> I don't understand all settings yet that photoshop is offering
[07:28:53] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: the swipe list demo looks nice too
[07:29:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah was good idea of you to go for gray highlight
[07:29:38] <uGoMobi> because of that i could remove the overlay too
[07:30:28] <toddmparker> yeah, looks cleaner
[07:30:29] <uGoMobi> I noticed issues with the address bar not being hidden on the swipe page demo
[07:30:40] <uGoMobi> also on a few other pages
[07:30:56] <uGoMobi> :(
[07:31:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what device?
[07:31:09] <toddmparker> yeah, i see that too
[07:31:17] <toddmparker> is it not tall enough?
[07:31:18] <uGoMobi> android 4.1 galaxy nexus
[07:31:29] <toddmparker> I'm on an iPhone5 so i'm taller
[07:31:53] <toddmparker> but address bar seems to jiggle a bit but not hide
[07:31:56] <uGoMobi> i also noticed on browserstack iOS6
[07:32:10] <toddmparker> thinking the fullscreen toolbars might be confusing the height?
[07:32:14] <uGoMobi> yeah, and sometimes it is hidden
[07:32:24] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I don't know yet
[07:32:31] <uGoMobi> on the intro pages i see it too
[07:33:05] <uGoMobi> I mean the page where you land after clicking the link to the demo on the index page
[07:33:32] <uGoMobi> that is with the two swipe demos but also with the redirect demo
[07:33:45] <uGoMobi> and does are pretty basic pages
[07:33:52] <uGoMobi> s/does/those/
[07:34:05] <toddmparker> yeah, i see it there too
[07:34:08] <toddmparker> odd
[07:34:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on my iphone4 ios5 its not hidden but its because  the content is not tall enough (works fine if you do it in landscape)
[07:35:02] <uGoMobi> going to test now by starting with blank page and adding stuff until i see the issue
[07:35:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah good point
[07:36:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it was actually toddmparkers point i just tested it lol
[07:36:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can we only hide the address bar when the page is longer than the screen?
[07:37:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it needs to be at least as tall normally this is done automaticly with a min-height .css() 
[07:37:30] <arschmitz> not sure why its not happening here
[07:37:59] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: on the swipe page demos, "view source" covers the title so maybe change it to "source" only?
[07:38:57] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah I noticed it's a bit narrow... I was even thinking of adding a MQ to hide the button on small screens
[07:40:11] <toddmparker> you could.
[07:40:39] <toddmparker> but dropping the word "view" and maybe the icon would make it fit fine I think
[07:41:01] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:41:07] <toddmparker> you basically wrote the page swipe plugin we have at filament
[07:42:14] <toddmparker> http://filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_mobile_pagination_plugin/
[07:42:37] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ha ha i was just reading an issue were you suggested that as a solution
[07:42:38] <uGoMobi> I can't adjust for the button for a specific demo without making things more complicated but will think of something
[07:42:58] <toddmparker> oh, is that auto-generated?
[07:43:32] <toddmparker> maybe we can use the landing pages to have more of a code walkthrough and for demos like that, not have view source?
[07:43:55] <toddmparker> that way demos can be more realistic - less overhead
[07:44:14] <uGoMobi> well i made the function inject that button when it finds certain data- attributes
[07:44:16] <toddmparker> and we can offer code snippets and a "how we did it" summary on that page before
[07:44:17] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i like that concept
[07:44:38] <toddmparker> i think for the individual little widget snippets, the view source makes sense
[07:44:49] <toddmparker> for more composed page-level demos, the intro might work better
[07:44:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: i wanted to do that, but the swipe page demo are single html pages
[07:45:08] <uGoMobi> and I am not sure if can pull in the source
[07:45:13] <toddmparker> right - each is a separate page
[07:45:14] <uGoMobi> on the intro page
[07:45:16] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:45:31] <uGoMobi> to prevent all images to be loaded at once
[07:45:38] <toddmparker> not, more thinking that we write a narrative and maybe have some hand-coded blocks of code to illustrate concepts
[07:46:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think that approach would be more usefull for demos like this
[07:46:13] <uGoMobi> yes that's a solution... I can copy the markup of one of those pages 
[07:46:22] <uGoMobi> and paste it on the intro page
[07:46:31] <toddmparker> right. that way you can also explain how you're doing things and why
[07:46:41] <uGoMobi> true
[07:46:52] <arschmitz> and give more of a how to
[07:47:04] <toddmparker> more of a code walkthrough. the point of these is to teach people how to do more complex things, not just have them copy/paste like they would with a widget
[07:47:24] <uGoMobi> i agree, that's why i added comments in the code
[07:47:32] <uGoMobi> but we could add more info
[07:47:47] <toddmparker> yeah, cool
[07:48:12] <toddmparker> that's why I like that you have these landing pages that precede a more complex example
[07:48:48] <toddmparker> guess we should give some thought to how we use the page when we have bigger screens
[07:48:54] <uGoMobi> ok I will move the markup source code to the intro page
[07:48:56] <arschmitz> yeah that setup is going to be perfect for my sortable / draggable demo that mimics the ios home screen
[07:48:57] <toddmparker> nice
[07:49:05] <toddmparker> arschmitz: - exactly
[07:49:12] <toddmparker> think of them as little tutorials
[07:49:46] <toddmparker> see, we'll stumble our way through the demos re-design just fine
[07:49:52] <arschmitz> lol
[07:50:12] <arschmitz> i think the demos are going to be an amazing resource for people
[07:50:14] <uGoMobi> I suggest that we first make sure we have some more demos up and running and then look into writing tutorial
[07:50:29] <toddmparker> sure, that works for me
[07:50:38] <toddmparker> at least now we have a plan
[07:50:39] <uGoMobi> but I will stick to the approach to start with intro page
[07:50:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have three or 4 i need to get uploaded
[07:51:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool
[07:51:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you end up trying that extension for swipe?
[07:52:09] <arschmitz> to stop scrolling from triggering it
[07:52:13] <uGoMobi> I am going to copy transition and popup examples to demos folder too
[07:52:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no I didn't test it yet... still have the link here
[07:52:44] <arschmitz> cool just curious
[07:53:03] <uGoMobi> maybe I copy the swipe list demo and add the extension
[07:53:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker: so how did you feel about the meeting with the guys from samsung last night?
[07:53:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats a good example for it tends to be a problem the most on list pages
[07:53:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: indeed, i didn't really notice it on page swipe
[07:54:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats because you cant scroll that page so scroll isnt really an issue
[07:54:23] <uGoMobi> other thing with swipe... when you have a list with linked list items swipe with mouse doesn't work anymore
[07:54:43] <arschmitz> it was working for me?
[07:54:46] <arschmitz> with mouse
[07:54:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, but at first i did have a longer page there
[07:55:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: on some browsers it did work and on others it didn't
[07:55:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ahh i see i only tried on chrome
[07:56:22] <uGoMobi> swipe with mouse is something probably most people don't even know it's possible
[07:56:33] <uGoMobi> i was one of them for long time
[07:57:23] <arschmitz> yeah true
[07:58:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh before i forget not sure if you have an intrest or not but since you helped me so much figured id share  http://vimeo.com/55067958 its my talk from jQuery asia
[07:58:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh that's cool... really like to see that!
[07:59:10] <arschmitz> all the talks from the conference are here http://vimeo.com/channels/441311

[13:19:30] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! Did anything break horribly while I was gone?
[13:23:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: total melt down you broke it all
[13:31:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks for fixing the source code view
[13:31:06] <_|Nix|_> Eeeeexcelent!
[13:31:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP.
[13:31:34] <uGoMobi> you were right about demoID
[13:31:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: SyntaxHighlighter.all() isn't /all/ that useful. It only attaches an event handler to window load.
[13:31:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool. I wasn't sure, but I had a feeling.
[13:32:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's why I switched to .highlight() ...
[13:32:23] <uGoMobi> yeah I didn't think of it because at first i didn't plan on have source code on multiple pages
[13:32:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do you think it would be worth delaying the actual enhancement of the sourcode until someone clicks on the "View Source" button to improve page loading time?
[13:32:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah that .all() isn't handy, I agree
[13:33:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you think it might be worth it, I'd love to do it.
[13:33:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I mentioned you that before, that I wanted to change that
[13:34:21] <arschmitz> johnbender: you here?
[13:34:23] <uGoMobi> but because I didn't see how I could specify what to enhance 
[13:34:35] <uGoMobi> I didn't see the use of it anymore
[13:34:53] <uGoMobi> if it is going to look for all <pre> tags each time anyway
[13:35:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, .highlight() can take an element.
[13:35:20] <uGoMobi> so i am not sure how we can do that 
[13:35:35] <uGoMobi> aha, I didn't see that in the API docs
[13:35:51] <uGoMobi> then we should do that 
[13:35:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I cloned the repo.
[13:36:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool
[13:36:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, do you mind if I give it a shot?
[13:36:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no not all, great if you want to look at that

[13:50:31] <johnbender> arschmitz: here now
[13:51:28] <arschmitz> johnbender: Afternoon
[13:51:44] <johnbender> arschmitz: listenting to the news makes me heart sick
[13:51:56] <johnbender> I would be _destroyed_ if anything happened to my daughter
[13:52:02] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah its really terrible
[13:52:24] <arschmitz> johnbender: is that why you asked if i had kids earlier?
[13:53:41] <arschmitz> johnbender: i had to leave an go to lunch early today because i was reading / watching all the stuff about it and i just didnt want to see any more
[13:53:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah
[13:54:02] <johnbender> it takes on a whole new dimension
[13:54:12] <johnbender> arschmitz: I didn't feel much when columbine happened
[13:54:16] <johnbender> but it's different now
[13:55:29] <arschmitz> johnbender: i think its somehow a lot different when its a highschool student and other highschool students vs little elementary school kids
[13:55:37] <johnbender> jesus
[13:57:11] <arschmitz> johnbender: i just cant even fathom so many little kids completely helpless and innocent i dont even want to think about it
[13:57:20] <johnbender> yep
[13:57:24] <johnbender> I can't think straight today
[13:58:53] <arschmitz> johnbender: on something a bit less scarry i was hoping maybe if you had some time next week you could help me with some unit tests
[13:59:05] <johnbender> arschmitz: absolutely
[13:59:48] <arschmitz> i need to write tests for the new range slider and i honestly have done too much with unit tests and i figured you would be the person to ask
[14:00:22] <arschmitz> im sure i could write some tests i know how the test suite works and everything but id really like to know what the "Best" approach is 
[14:00:38] <arschmitz> *have not done too much
[14:00:42] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool
[14:00:51] <johnbender> maybe a google hangout on monday or something
[14:00:54] <johnbender> shouldn't be too painful
[14:00:55] <johnbender> :)
[14:00:59] <arschmitz> sounds good
[14:01:28] <arschmitz> yeah there wont be too too many since its essentially a wrapper on slider so all the slider tests still apply
[14:01:50] <johnbender> cool
[14:02:40] <arschmitz> johnbender: cool i appreciate it its an area id like to get much better in
[14:02:51] <johnbender> arschmitz: always good to be good at testing :)
[14:03:11] <arschmitz> johnbender: exactly 
[14:03:26] <arschmitz> johnbender: makes for much better code
[14:05:24] <arschmitz> johnbender: well im heading home for the day. Take care and thanks for the help in advance
[14:05:34] <johnbender> arschmitz: have a good one

[15:10:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker: I added 2 things already :)
[15:15:34] <toddmparker> great!
[15:15:43] <toddmparker> just collecting, needs a lot of editing
[15:23:39] <toddmparker> arschmitz: we need to add a lot of your presentation info into docs and demos. good stuff.
[15:24:21] <arschmitz> Awesome thanks I have the actual slides on my we'd site too
[15:24:31] <toddmparker> link?
[15:24:36] <arschmitz> Stupid iOS lol
[15:24:57] <toddmparker> hey - I'd love it if you took a crack at writing a simpler page explaining the ajax nav model
[15:25:04] <toddmparker> like the start of your deck
[15:25:18] <arschmitz> www.uglymongrel.com/jqueryasia
[15:25:19] <toddmparker> feel like it's too complex now
[15:25:32] <toddmparker> nice job!
[15:25:57] <arschmitz> Yeah I can do that no problem
[15:26:15] <toddmparker> great info
[15:26:26] <toddmparker> love the gifs
[15:26:45] <johnbender> toddmparker: arschmitz: merging nav changes
[15:27:00] <johnbender> the build will be broken but it has to do with some select focus stuff
[15:27:09] <johnbender> I'll talk with _|Nix|_ about it on Monday
[15:27:13] <johnbender> hmmm
[15:27:18] <johnbender> maybe I should wait until monday
[15:27:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: Animalsbeingdicks.com best site ever lol
[15:28:01] <johnbender> :)
[15:29:06] <toddmparker> seriously
[15:29:15] <toddmparker> man, so much good info in there
[15:29:17] <arschmitz> johnbender: Can't wait to give it a spin
[15:29:30] <toddmparker> the format is good too - the dev's thought, then the solution
[15:29:55] <toddmparker> a version of that in prose form would rock
[15:30:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: Yeah I see those come up every day in the issues and stuff
[15:30:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker: Lol
[15:30:39] <arschmitz> toddmparker: I helped ryanneufeld with two issues from it just yesterday
[15:31:20] <toddmparker> nice!
[15:31:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker: There was originally a lot more had to cut a lot for time
[15:31:30] <toddmparker> what's your twitter handle?
[15:31:41] <arschmitz> Alexrschmitz
[15:31:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Ping!
[15:31:51] <bot-t> (43 mins 40 secs ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ the _handleDocuemntFocusIn doesn't terminate
[15:31:51] <bot-t> (43 mins 9 secs ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_: it focuses the UI container which focus in turn triggers the focusin event on the document
[15:31:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So there's a focus loop?
[15:32:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah
[15:32:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: let me push the latest to the merged nav branch
[15:32:27] <johnbender> toddmparker: _|Nix|_: I had to do some dirty ugly things to make this all work
[15:32:32] <johnbender> I'm not proud of it
[15:32:39] <johnbender> but the uglyness is at least confined to the old stuff
[15:32:51] <johnbender> the new stuff is still semi sane
[15:32:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I thought I had handled all the cases where it could end up in a loop :-S
[15:32:55] <johnbender> an I'll keep working on it
[15:33:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm not surprised that I came up with a new one
[15:33:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: :)
[15:33:15] <johnbender> this library is such a balancing act at this point
[15:33:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Focus restriction is hard.
[15:33:57] <toddmparker> still chipping away at panels. they are a huge pain.
[15:34:26] <johnbender> toddmparker: _|Nix|_: I'm going to focus on unit tests for the stuff I added
[15:34:33] <johnbender> so the failures will be more obvious / local
[15:34:39] <johnbender> primarily the path stuff
[15:34:40] <johnbender> jesus
[15:34:44] <johnbender> so crazy
[15:34:59] <johnbender> and I need to do some cleanup in the navigate method stuff
[15:35:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thanks a lot I appreciate the praise I thought it went terrible at the time
[15:35:13] <toddmparker> ok johnbender 
[15:35:25] <toddmparker> arschmitz: heh
[15:35:31] <toddmparker> always feels that way

[15:40:27] <johnbender> toddmparker: you linked to animated gif
[15:40:31] <johnbender> toddmparker: maybe I don't get the joke?
[15:41:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, that failure to terminate - is that what's causing the timeouts?
[15:41:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no timeouts left
[15:41:15] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: fixed those
[15:41:22] <johnbender> sequence tests are green and consistent locally
[15:41:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, great! So, how do I repro that _handleDocumentFocusIn non-termination?
[15:41:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the failures caught real issues with the implementation
[15:41:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: run the select tests
[15:41:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[15:42:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: they fail consistently
[15:42:10] <johnbender> but you need more than just the test itself :(
[15:42:14] <johnbender> that is, order matters
[15:42:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's fine. The select tests do not take a long itme.
[15:42:51] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and you can always comment out sections
[15:42:58] <johnbender> that's what I was doing when I was trying to figure it out
[15:43:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Unfortunately, I might not be able to do it right away. It's already 01:43 here ...
[15:43:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you can, add some comments in there about the different cases it tries to avoid
[15:43:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: oh yah
[15:43:24] <johnbender> don't worry about it
[15:43:28] <johnbender> I was thinking monday
[15:43:39] <johnbender> I'll probably merge it into master one way or another
[15:43:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Good idea. I'll comment up the _handleDocumentFocusIn method.
[15:43:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll fix it for sure.
[15:50:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: again it's likely to be a problem with something I've done in nav
[15:50:25] <johnbender> or some assumption that fails there
[15:50:28] <johnbender> but who knows
[15:58:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I dunno - _handleDocumentFocusIn is all about focus ... the new nav stuff may have simply exposed a flaw in it that was always there.
[15:58:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I hope so :)
[15:59:04] <johnbender> selfishly speaking
[15:59:15] <_|Nix|_> :)
[15:59:29] <_|Nix|_> Anyway ... one more push to the demos and I a soooo gone.
