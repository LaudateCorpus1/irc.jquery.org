[01:22:21] <uGoMobi> pingou: thanks, the page seems to be working again. we are aware of problems with view.jquerymobile.com and are working on a solution
[01:54:23] <pingou> uGoMobi: cool, thanks!
[02:06:10] <uGoMobi> pingou: np, the view on branches instead of specific versions seems less buggy, so when you get a 404 again you could try http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3-stable/demos/
[02:06:57] <pingou> seems to work indeed :)
[02:07:13] <pingou> I managed to get it working yesterday (base on the code of the example)
[02:07:35] <uGoMobi> pingou: ok great
[02:07:40] <pingou> this morning I was having trouble with a data-role="button"
[02:07:47] <pingou> but I'll try to debug tonight
[02:08:08] <uGoMobi> pingou: also note that in http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/ all JPG's are broken (Murphy's Law)
[02:09:08] <pingou> uGoMobi: "Murphy was right, so they killed him" :)
[02:09:18] <uGoMobi> :)
[02:10:53] <pingou> http://ambre.pingoured.fr/fedora_apps/ if you have an idea, click on "Updates" for the page with the button :)
[02:14:41] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[02:14:42] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom 1.2-stable build #156: FIXED in 13 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%201.2-stable/156/

[02:15:19] <uGoMobi> pingou: move scripts to the <head> and bind to "pageinit" instead of "ready"
[02:17:26] <uGoMobi> pingou: don't use show() and hide() but changePage()
[02:30:28] <pingou> uGoMobi: like this?
[02:31:28] <pingou> hm not quite :)
[02:34:03] <pingou> hm pity that the js of the example isn't in the page itself :(
[02:44:40] <pingou> uGoMobi: http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.changePage/ shall I do something to see the examples?
[02:45:45] <uGoMobi> pingou: hmm, that doesn't look good :(
[02:46:17] <uGoMobi> ?tell agcolom : looks like we have a problem with the examples on http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.changePage/
[02:46:17] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Iâ€™ll tell agcolom about that.
[02:46:35] <pingou> uGoMobi: I changed my html/js as you adviced but I bet I forgot something :)
[02:54:10] <uGoMobi> pingou: http://jsbin.com/owasir/33/edit
[02:55:58] <pingou> awesome, thanks :)
[02:56:03] * pingou tries to understand now :)
[02:58:21] <uGoMobi> pingou: each time a JQM page is initialized "pageinit" fires and that first $.mobile.changePage('#index_page'); you had in your code was bringing you back to the homepage
[02:59:07] <uGoMobi> pingou: for more support you can use the #jquery channel
[02:59:23] <pingou> uGoMobi: thanks (for both advices)
[02:59:41] <uGoMobi> pingou: np and good luck with your project
[03:00:29] <pingou> thanks

[05:21:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: trouble with view again today?
[05:21:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, someone reported 404 7 hours ago
[05:21:59] <arschmitz> shoot of course while i was asleep
[05:22:18] <arschmitz> happened while i was eating dinner last night too i just cant seem to catch it lol
[05:22:44] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:24:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: problem is view is updated from a cron every 5 minutes
[05:24:25] <arschmitz> and there is a log of the update
[05:24:34] <arschmitz> but it is replaced on every run
[05:24:54] <arschmitz> so i need to check the log in the 5 minutes its down before the next run
[05:27:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can't we temporary export the log or something?
[05:28:24] <arschmitz>  uGoMobi yes but i dont want to mess with the server too much i just got the keys yesterday :)
[05:28:32] <arschmitz> dont want to go changing crons :)
[05:28:51] <uGoMobi> yeah I can imagine
[05:29:17] <arschmitz> iv been trying to get it setup localy and have it save the logs
[05:29:38] <arschmitz> i have view running fine and updateing locally execpt i cant get grunt to run from a cron
[05:29:56] <arschmitz> and cant figure out why
[05:53:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5956
[05:53:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how about not using dialogs for custom select menus anymore? :)
[05:54:12] <uGoMobi> we want to deprecate dialog and make it a style option in the page widget anyway
[06:14:32] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Ka0o0 opened issue #5957: JQuery change event does not fire up with JQuery 2.0  02http://git.io/p7jVCw
[06:57:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you cherry-pick the fix for that prefetch issue into 1.3-stable?
[06:57:56] <arschmitz> ah no im terrible about cherry picking ill do it
[06:59:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok thanks
[07:18:22] <gseguin> mornin' folks
[07:50:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, what would you suggest? Popups? Those don't work well for large lists.
[07:50:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think I'll fix the functionality for now, and we can decide about that later.
[07:51:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, I was thinking just popups
[07:52:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I dunno ... are you thinking like the ones for view source? i.e., they have a scrollbar inside.
[07:52:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but if that causes problems with long list then it's probably not a good idea
[07:52:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why not just use a page styled as a dialog basicly the same as it is now 
[07:52:49] <arschmitz> just do a dynamic page
[07:52:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's what's happening now.
[07:52:59] <arschmitz> right
[07:53:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It uses a dynamic dialog.
[07:53:06] <arschmitz> i know
[07:53:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes of course we can style use that
[07:53:25] <uGoMobi> I was just thinking about simplifying things
[07:53:51] <_|Nix|_> The original bug was that it doesn't remove the page upon _destroy(). Then, while fixing that, I found that the sequence page1 -> page2 -> dialog-sized-select <- back ends up going back twice.
[07:54:02] <_|Nix|_> I bet both the select and the dialog are calling $.mobile.back.
[07:54:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: probably sounds reasonable
[07:54:42] <_|Nix|_> I've seen that before, but I can't figure out why it has returned (notice I refrained from phrasing it "why it's back" ) :)
[07:54:53] <gseguin> how does one go about finding some info in http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquerymobile-dev/ ?
[07:55:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Ctrl+F
[07:55:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: are you talking about this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5935?
[07:55:18] <gseguin> heh :)
[07:55:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Or, you can google site:irc.jquery.org <string>
[07:55:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: come on bad puns are great :)
[07:55:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[07:55:44] <gseguin> ha, yes that sounds like a much better idea
[07:56:12] <gseguin> well... no dice
[07:58:28] <gseguin> nevermind, I found what I was looking for
[08:05:10] <_|Nix|_> OK ... pretty simple. A matter of hooking up to pagebeforehide and turning off this._isCloseable for the dialog.
[08:05:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sweet
[08:09:42] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper! 
[08:09:42] <b-ot> agcolom: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.

[08:10:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne
[08:10:21] <agcolom> oh yes ;-) Will fix that this evening or tomorrow :-)
[08:10:35] <agcolom> (I'm still at work)
[08:10:41] <dimaursu16> hello :)
[08:11:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... pagebeforehide may be too late ... I wonder what happens if you go $.mobile.back(); $myDialog.dialog( "close" );
[08:11:04] <dimaursu16> guys, how can I bring up the keyboard on a tablet using jquery?
[08:12:09] <arschmitz> dimaursu16: thats really a question for #jquery this channel is for the jqm devs
[08:12:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, that works.
[08:14:30] <dimaursu16> arschmitz, I forgot to tell that I use jquery mobile...
[08:15:02] <arschmitz> dimaursu16: that channel is for all jquery related questions
[08:15:11] <dimaursu16> I want to bring up the keyboard on a long touch event...but I don't know what I need to call for that...
[08:15:19] <dimaursu16> arschmitz, ok :)
[08:47:47] <gseguin> naming question
[08:48:28] <gseguin> why does our repo as well as our package.json say jquery-mobile yet our dist files are "jquery.mobile"
[08:48:29] <gseguin> ?
[08:49:06] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: dot or hyphen ?
[08:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> Because they're different things :-)
[08:50:14] <scott_gonzalez> Would you name a directory jquery.mobile?
[08:50:44] <gseguin> I'm just wondering
[08:50:59] <gseguin> so UI's files are jquery.ui ?
[08:51:04] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[08:51:07] <gseguin> oh ok
[08:51:21] <gseguin> just want to make sure we do the same thing as the rest of the projects
[08:51:26] <gseguin> thanks
[08:51:44] <scott_gonzalez> Though our dist file is jquery-ui.js
[08:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> Dist files are hyphenated, source files are dotted. I realize that may seem strange.
[08:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> Though jquery-color also seems to dot the dist file.
[08:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> Consistency would be nice here (for the dist files), but I don't see a need for any projects to change.
[08:58:12] <gseguin> ok that's what I thought from reading the Gruntfile.js
