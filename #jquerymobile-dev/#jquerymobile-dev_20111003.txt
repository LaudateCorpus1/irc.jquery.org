[08:51:02] <johnbender> exit
[08:52:04] <johnbender> scottjehl: kinblas: I thought switching my nick might make things easier
[08:52:15] * johnbender likes consistency
[08:52:34] <kinblas> heh
[08:52:38] * kinblas likes
[08:53:00] <johnbender> also I realized a while ago that typing _ for autocomplete on the name was probably annoying
[08:53:04] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah scottjehl is pretty consistent with the nick he uses *EVERYEWHERE*
[09:21:42] <gseguin> morning all
[09:34:28] <johnbender> gseguin: heyo!
[09:34:33] <johnbender> gseguin: are you a dad yet!?!?!
[09:34:36] <johnbender> err
[09:34:38] <johnbender> for the second time
[09:34:39] <gseguin> hey johnbender
[09:34:44] <gseguin> not yet
[09:35:02] <gseguin> she seems to be confortable in there
[09:35:23] <gseguin> johnbender: how was jqcon ?
[09:39:16] <johnbender> gseguin: it was great!
[09:39:33] <gseguin> are there videos available somewhere?
[09:39:39] <johnbender> super fun to hang out with scott, todd and some of the other jquery notables
[09:39:44] <johnbender> gseguin: nothing official
[09:39:55] <johnbender> I there were some folks recording though
[09:40:44] <gseguin> johnbender: Where is adobe max? in LA or SF ?
[09:42:17] <eddiemonge> la
[09:42:29] <gseguin> hey eddiemonge
[09:42:35] <eddiemonge> johnbender: you are one of two talks i have recorded
[09:42:41] <johnbender> eddiemonge: thanks guy!
[09:42:44] <johnbender> lol
[09:42:50] <eddiemonge> i have to edit it before i can upload it because its about 4gb
[09:42:52] <johnbender> I get to watch myself motormouth for 30 mins
[09:42:59] <eddiemonge> hi gseguin
[11:31:45] <johnbender> toddparker: so I can reproduce the 2.2 orientationchange deathloop
[11:31:56] <johnbender> in the emulator
[11:32:01] <johnbender> dirt slow as it is
[11:46:14] <toddparker> kinblas: thoughts? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2559
[11:46:15] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2559 on jquery-mobile, reported by kirk911 (4d, 23h ago): href taphold event handler on iPhone causes native response
[12:19:30] <danzik17> eddiemonge: are you gonna upload it somewhere public?  was dissapointed i couldn't go, hoping to watch some of the talks on youtube or something
[12:21:30] <eddiemonge> danzik17: when i get around to it ill put it on youtube. his and mine slides are out there though
[12:30:28] <toddparker> hi all - triaging the new bugs form RC1
[12:30:37] <toddparker> nothing too big in there
[12:30:54] <toddparker> maybe we can shoot for another RC in about a week?
[13:22:59] <kinblas> toddparker: regarding 2559 I'll have to look at what it takes to disable the native OS tap hold
[13:23:24] <toddparker> is that even a good idea kinblas
[13:23:39] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: what is it that you guys use to create your videos like the one for TR? The one that shows the clicks as circles and what you type
[13:23:55] <kinblas> toddparker: personally I don't think so, but if there were an event that was generated, we could preventDefault() on it
[13:24:00] <kinblas> or let folks know how to do it.
[13:29:26] <toddparker> gotcha on the event kinblas
[13:29:30] <toddparker> makes sense
[13:29:47] <toddparker> we use an app called screenflow
[13:29:50] <toddparker> mac only
[13:29:57] <toddparker> ui is kinda odd, but it does a good job
[13:30:14] <toddparker> errrr…kinblas
[13:30:29] <toddparker> what's up with the theme in this tutorial? http://www.adobe.com/devnet/fireworks/articles/css3-mobile-pack-jquery.html
[13:30:38] <toddparker> you guys are *adobe* right?
[13:30:48] <toddparker> scroll to the end of the article…tada!
[13:31:09] <toddparker> italic bold times new roam with that awes gradient? sheesh
[13:31:23] <toddparker> aweful btw
[13:31:37] <kinblas> toddparker: lol
[13:31:42] <kinblas> you can tell that's an engineer
[13:31:57] <toddparker> yep.
[13:32:11] <kinblas> toddparker: not everyone is as talented as you guys :-P
[13:32:16] <toddparker> seems like TR will be a better option unless you want to make graphics
[13:32:28] <kinblas> you guys are a triple threat combo
[13:32:41] <toddparker> ^^ that's what TR is for…keep engineers from "designing" like that
[13:32:53] <kinblas> toddparker: You see the CSS Shaders proposal?
[13:33:12] <toddparker> good looks, good designers, rock solid abs?
[13:33:19] <toddparker> not yet...
[13:33:20] <kinblas> lol

[13:33:51] <kinblas> hawt
[14:05:05] <toddparker> PhoneGap eh? Wow
[14:06:08] <TehShrike|Work> Dustin Curtis was dissing on PhoneGap today
[14:06:23] <toddparker> for "selling" out
[14:06:31] <TehShrike|Work> No
[14:06:45] <TehShrike|Work> For people using it to make apps that feel off because they don't look native
[14:06:56] <TehShrike|Work> https://twitter.com/dcurtis
[14:06:57] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from dcurtis: The answer, just in case you were wondering, is no; there is not a single decent iOS app made with PhoneGap. Not even close. ★ http://bit.ly/odJcrw
[14:07:04] <TehShrike|Work> Whatcha gonna do?
[14:08:31] <TehShrike|Work> Native controls don't appear to be on the PhoneGap roadmap any more.
[14:14:59] <gseguin> toddparker: I think that comment: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2584#issuecomment-2278784 belongs to another issue
[14:15:00] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2584 on jquery-mobile, reported by agcolom (3d, 11m ago): bottom border of single collapsible and last collapsible in set when collapsed
[14:17:22] <toddparker> gseguin: that issue is the collapsible bottom rounding, no?
[14:17:51] <toddparker> oh, i see
[15:26:52] <kinblas> wow the android emulator still sucks when running with 8gb of ram
[16:38:32] <johnbender> working in the android simulator is so painfully slow
[16:38:41] <johnbender> my iteration speed is like 1/min
[16:44:38] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm feeling that pain tooo ... testing out a phonegap problem
[16:44:49] <kinblas> it's sooooo unuseable
[16:45:09] <kinblas> johnbender: fyi, Android 2.1 runs faster on the emulator, unless you really need 2.2 which is slooooooow
[16:45:13] <kinblas> slower that is
[16:45:54] <johnbender> kinblas: I do, thats were the bug presents :(
[16:46:06] <johnbender> notice that I used presents
[16:46:10] <johnbender> "presents"
[16:46:30] <johnbender> I did not purposely refer to it in the way doctors refer to a _disease_
[16:46:42] <johnbender> freudian slip
[16:54:17] <kinblas> heh
[17:05:51] <johnbender> having finally boiled this down, I think we'll need to do something about orientationchange
[17:06:09] <johnbender> maybe vorientation
[17:06:31] <johnbender> not at all sure what to do in the short term though
[17:06:41] <johnbender> aside from just disabling it and using resize
[17:06:50] <johnbender> err the throttledresize
[17:07:30] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah I was thinking that too
[17:07:38] <kinblas> the events arrive in different orders on the different platform
[17:07:56] <kinblas> folks need an event that fires when we are sure the dust has settled
[17:08:32] <kinblas> johnbender: btw, I think on some device platforms there is no orientationchange event
[17:08:36] <kinblas> only resize
[17:08:57] <kinblas> but I think we fake it
[17:26:45] <johnbender> kinblas: yah
[17:26:59] <johnbender> or virtual event was orientationchange
[17:27:01] <johnbender> *our
[17:27:22] <kinblas> johnbender: doesn't iOS fire an orientationchange natively?
[17:27:44] <johnbender> yes, as does android
[17:27:57] <johnbender> we we're detecting support and handling it differently
[17:28:02] <johnbender> *are
[17:28:13] <johnbender> in fact I have it working properly
[17:28:25] <johnbender> but android 2.2 fires the events spuriously it appears
[17:28:37] <johnbender> so we'd have to throttle it anyway
