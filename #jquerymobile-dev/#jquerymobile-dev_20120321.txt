[07:10:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah. Was thinking about a hangout chat ...
[07:10:51] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: But IRC's fine too ...
[07:10:57] <gseguin> that sounds good
[07:11:11] <gseguin> I'll ping when I start work
[07:11:18] <_|Nix|_> K.
[07:53:31] <Wilto> Morning, guys.
[08:41:24] <Wilto> johnbender: I’m digging the demos built into your slides.
[08:48:08] <scottjehl> hey all
[08:54:20] <Wilto> DAMMIT, SCOTT— oh I mean “hi Scott.”
[08:55:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Ping!
[08:55:08] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yup
[08:55:20] <gseguin> let m e create a hangout
[08:55:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Cool!
[08:57:23] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: oh I don't have you in my circles for some reason
[08:58:07] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK ... how do we get that set up?
[08:58:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'm gabrielschulhof@gmail.com ...
[09:00:27] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: just started one
[09:00:49] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK ... how do I join?

[10:27:26] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: gseguin: I updated the phonegap application with a form that redirects to any site
[10:27:39] <johnbender> so now we can test jsbins inside the latest phonegap
[10:27:47] <Wilto> Duuuude.
[10:28:01] <Wilto> That’s gonna be _crazy_ useful.
[10:28:39] <johnbender> yah that should be helpful
[10:28:51] <johnbender> the only downside is that it's only 1.5 right now
[10:29:02] <johnbender> though it's trivially easy to create new apps with different version of phonegap
[10:29:11] <johnbender> just tell me and I'll put one up there if you need it
[10:29:39] <johnbender> Wilto: you have the link right?
[10:30:21] <Wilto> Most likely, buried in a pile of emails containing the terms “Android” and “fixed.”
[10:30:42] <Wilto> (I am inordinately bitter about such bugs.)
[10:31:32] <gseguin> what!? someone fixed Android!?
[10:31:54] <gseguin> oh... nope I just misread :)
[10:32:06] <johnbender> Wilto: do we have a canonical "force a reflow" button in the library that I can use to fix this thing:
[10:32:11] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3795
[10:32:11] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3795 on jquery-mobile (peterzheng; 1w, 2d ago): PhoneGap Android: Fixed toolbar orientation issue on Galaxy Nexus
[10:34:24] <Wilto> johnbender: There be dragons.
[10:34:32] <johnbender> sigh
[10:34:44] <Wilto> Like a total redraw, you could do something like `document.innerHTML = document.innerHTML`, I think.
[10:34:50] <Wilto> Or add a space, or something.
[10:37:40] <Wilto> What’s the deal, here? We need to trigger a reflow manually after orientationchange?
[10:39:31] <johnbender> Wilto: not sure I want to try it
[10:40:41] <jzaefferer> johnbender: could you define what browsers you want to test mobile against in swarm? we can add another "group" for that
[10:41:19] <johnbender> jzaefferer: http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/ A grade?
[10:41:22] <johnbender> I mean
[10:41:26] <johnbender> I guess as many as possible
[10:41:39] <jzaefferer> relevant: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/config/useragents.sql and https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/logic/addjob.php#L42
[10:42:01] <johnbender> yikes
[10:42:06] <johnbender> alright
[10:42:09] <johnbender> I'll look into it
[10:42:14] <jzaefferer> only mobile? or also chrome? firefox? safari?
[10:42:38] <johnbender> jzaefferer: and desktop, it's in that list
[10:42:48] <johnbender> s/it's/they are/
[10:43:32] <jzaefferer> current+mobile?
[10:43:49] <jzaefferer> Wouldn't want to run in IE6, right?
[10:43:59] <johnbender> jzaefferer: nope, just the ones in the support list
[10:44:07] <johnbender> though safari is conspicously absent
[10:44:23] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[10:45:05] <johnbender> jzaefferer: we support safari I believe and the library runs brilliantly there so I would include it
[10:45:34] <jzaefferer> ok
[10:46:06] <jzaefferer> so I'd add currentmobile -> (current = 1 OR mobile = 1)
[10:47:56] <jzaefferer> or we just run against current
[10:49:08] <johnbender> jzaefferer: sorry I have to visually parse the literals next to each browser
[10:49:17] <jzaefferer> giving that a try to compare to last run
[10:49:39] <jzaefferer> yeah, thats crap :/
[10:49:44] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah I guess that's fine
[10:49:59] <johnbender> I don't think the older versions of the desktop browsers much matter
[10:50:13] <johnbender> jzaefferer: thanks for your help man!
[10:50:16] <jzaefferer> the fun begins: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/63/
[10:50:24] <johnbender> lol
[10:50:26] <johnbender> black and red!
[10:50:33] <johnbender> I need to go through and do that cleanup
[10:50:34] <Wilto> Did I just overhear that jzaefferer is gonna take care of all our bugs from now on? AWESOME; NO TAKEBACKS
[10:50:38] <johnbender> but that might not be until the week after next
[10:53:51] <toddparker> hey all!
[10:54:30] <toddparker> johnbender: do you remember a conversation about the URL bar dropping and it causing issues? Feel like Kin was talking about this int he last 2 weeks
[10:55:32] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, there's a fix scott made to prevent the URL bar from dropping down that was very event handler ordering specific
[10:55:43] <kinblas> it broke when we switched to 1.7
[10:56:02] <kinblas> and gseguin was doing some experimentation with trying to figure out how to force our handlers to fire in the old-order
[10:56:20] * gseguin catches up
[10:56:30] <kinblas> scott's fix involved changing the href of URLs to # temporarily
[10:56:42] <kinblas> which IMO is something we should be oing
[10:56:43] <kinblas> doing
[10:56:51] <kinblas> er shouldn't be doing
[10:56:52] <johnbender> kinblas: I think you mean "shouldn't
[10:56:55] <johnbender> yah
[10:57:10] <johnbender> I'll second that
[10:57:14] <johnbender> seems super fragile
[10:57:20] <gseguin> i'll triple that
[10:57:55] <gseguin> ran into a bug with our product running against jQM master yesterday that was caused by that
[10:58:14] <gseguin> because we were ourselve monkeying with the url
[10:58:20] <kinblas> toddparker: btw did you see my post on orientation for iPhone?
[10:58:26] * gseguin is not proud of that
[10:58:53] <Wilto> kinblas: Post, you say.
[10:59:02] <kinblas> Wilto: well .basecamp
[10:59:30] <Wilto> Oh, oh.
[11:00:01] <Wilto> Oh man, brutal.
[11:00:31] <kinblas> Wilto: yeah, that's a big iOS bug
[11:00:47] <Wilto> Man. What curse-weaving gypsy did we piss off, lately?
[11:00:47] <kinblas> weird that it's iphone only though
[11:04:16] <Wilto> What about something like orientation: landscape and min-width: 321px? I dunno.
[11:05:07] <jzaefferer> kinblas: as ugly as it is, monkeying with href attr is the only reliable weapon against the Mobile Safari bar, at least thats what I found last year
[11:05:20] <jzaefferer> looks like Scott came to the same result
[11:05:37] <jzaefferer> maybe better to report that to Apple...
[11:06:11] <kinblas> jzaefferer: yeah the problem though is that we change it at a time when most developers hook into the system to do their app-specific work
[11:07:06] <jzaefferer> Yeah, sucks when the framework does it :/
[11:07:07] <kinblas> jzaefferer: I thought that the URL bar dropped even when clicking on # links ... I remember filing a bug with apple about that a year or more ago
[11:07:37] <jzaefferer> could be - I probably just removed the href
[11:07:57] <jzaefferer> kinblas: are you coming to jqcon in June?
[11:10:14] <Wilto> kinblas / jzaefferer: You guys worked on some stuff in the neighborhood of vclick recently, yeah?
[11:10:28] <Wilto> Anything change recently that could mess with tap coordinates?
[11:12:17] <Wilto> Or gseguin? I forget who it was.
[11:13:06] <kinblas> Wilto: mess it up in what way?
[11:13:38] <Wilto> toddparker and I have been noticing that taps on the Android 2.3 Nexus don’t always seem to register in the right place.
[11:13:38] <kinblas> jzaefferer: pointed out that we weren't copying over pageX/Y on tap events ... turns out it was due to some changes that were made to vmouse for 1.7 support
[11:13:53] <kinblas> we weren't copying mouse props for "click" only for "mouse" events
[11:14:02] <Wilto> kinblas: Ah, yeah, can’t possibly imagine that be related.
[11:14:27] <kinblas> Wilto: other than that, I don't think anyone has messed with vmouse/tap
[11:14:53] <Wilto> I guess I haven’t done enough general browsing on 2.3 to know if that’s an endemic thing.
[11:15:20] <johnbender> kinblas: ah that was the 1.7 fix
[11:16:00] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah, I modified the regex to fix it
[11:16:22] <kinblas> though a user pointed out that we should probably move that regex out of the function so it's not created dynamically every time that function is called
[11:17:02] <kinblas> ... which is a good suggestion since that call gets triggered quite a bit on touchmove/mousemove
[11:17:45] <Wilto> Legit.
[11:17:52] <toddparker> kinblas: i'm trying to track down something
[11:18:15] <toddparker> recently, you were talking about the url bar dropping
[11:18:16] <toddparker> was that on basecamp? email? issue?
[11:18:55] <kinblas> toddparker: hmmm, it was on github I think for that bug that gseguin was working on
[11:26:08] <scottjehl> hey
[11:26:13] <johnbender> ZOMG
[11:26:23] * johnbender runs to get his camera
[11:26:30] <johnbender> SASQWATCHAMACALLIT
[11:26:46] * johnbender starts snapping pictures of scottjehl
[11:26:47] <scottjehl> I prefer yeti
[11:26:49] <johnbender> I've got prrof!
[11:26:52] <johnbender> *proof
[11:27:08] <Wilto> ?OBJECTION
[11:27:09] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/objection.jpg
[11:27:56] <scottjehl> saswhatever is not like, the preferred nomenclature dude
[11:28:16] <scottjehl> so the address bar behaves fine again when you remove data-prefetch from the links
[11:28:17] <johnbender> lol
[11:28:20] <scottjehl> here's my guess
[11:28:21] <johnbender> such a good moview
[11:29:09] <scottjehl> hmm nevermind no guesses yet
[11:29:13] <scottjehl> but that's the problem
[11:29:25] <scottjehl> data-prefetch causes the address bar to show
[11:35:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/uRPqhA

[13:04:51] * gseguin is back
[13:42:12] <johnbender> oh man
[13:42:17] <johnbender> tmobile with no contract
[13:42:19] <johnbender> holy crap
[13:42:34] <johnbender> the oppresive weight of an 80/month contract is gone from my soul
[13:42:37] <johnbender> so amazing
[14:17:56] <johnbender> Wilto: toddparker: I'm going to get a start on the jquerymobile intro that I'm giving at two meetups in SF next week
[14:36:00] <gseguin> johnbender: can I see your slides?
[14:36:09] <johnbender> gseguin: for the intro?
[14:36:13] <gseguin> yup
[14:36:17] <johnbender> gseguin: just getting started
[14:36:18] <gseguin> do you have some?
[14:36:26] <gseguin> oh ok, that's what you meant
[14:36:32] <johnbender> but when I get something worth seeing I'll let you know
[14:36:39] <gseguin> cool
[14:36:44] <johnbender> gseguin: I can give you my outline once I finish it if you're curious about the material
[14:45:19] <johnbender> gseguin: alright I have a rough outline if you want it
[14:45:42] <gseguin> wow that was fast
[14:45:44] <gseguin> shoot
[14:46:09] <johnbender> well its a jqm intro so it's not rocket science
[14:46:24] <johnbender> and I'm borrowing some of the structure from what I remember of Todd's intro presentation
[14:46:36] <johnbender> https://gist.github.com/3f7c31cf1ecf3a8405ca
[14:46:40] <johnbender> it's an org mode doc though
[14:47:21] <johnbender> I think I have like 45 minutes to an hour at each meetup so I'll just take my time with the various slides
[14:48:08] <johnbender> most of the "why jqm/why jqm does that" will be in the * JQM subsection
[14:48:17] <johnbender> and the start slides are just my own intro
[15:00:11] <Wilto> Okay guys, riddle me this:
[15:00:58] <Wilto> We’re explicitly setting inline: false as a buttonMarkup default, which doesn’t do anything.
[15:01:03] <Wilto> Why is that?
[15:01:26] <Wilto> I’m thinking, given that buttons default to inline in headers/footers, users should be able to override that with data-inline="false".
[15:02:32] <Wilto> But I can’t really distinguish between a button set to false and one _defaulting_ to false, the way things are set up now.
[15:02:45] <johnbender> Wilto: I think it just takes all the options and converts them into data attributes for reading later
[15:02:54] <Wilto> Yeah, it does.
[15:02:54] <johnbender> so the default happens to be false
[15:03:08] <Wilto> Do we really need that for anything, though?
[15:03:13] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm assuming we do
[15:03:32] <johnbender> that plugin was created a long time ago so it might be worth a review post 1.2?
[15:03:44] <Wilto> I’d assume too, but I can’t imagine what it would be.
[15:04:12] <Wilto> It’s all CSS stuff, and all buttons are styled as non-inline unless otherwise specified.
[15:04:30] <Wilto> Anyway, yeah, nothing pressing for sure. Just fixing a couple header/footer button styles and it jumped out at me.
[15:06:05] <Wilto> Takin’ off; have a good night, folks.
[15:06:14] <johnbender> Wilto: see you tomorrow
