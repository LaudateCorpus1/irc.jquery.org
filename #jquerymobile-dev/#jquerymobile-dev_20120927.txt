[02:44:15] <_|Nix|_> wingy: I'm doing at as part of my job, and so are most of us here.
[02:44:39] <wingy> _|Nix|_: who is paying you?
[02:44:47] <wingy> im curious about who is behing jquery mobile
[02:44:53] <wingy> looks so much better than Sencha
[02:45:17] <_|Nix|_> wingy: Intel.
[02:45:40] <wingy> they are using jquery mobile so they wanna have active development on it?
[02:46:22] <_|Nix|_> wingy: The rest of the guys are from The Filament Group, Adobe, and Jive. There's one person who's self-employed (uGoMobi) and another who works for a University (agcolom).
[02:46:45] <wingy> so 6 active devs
[02:46:47] <_|Nix|_> wingy: I dunno much about the big picture, but I love working on jQM.
[02:47:02] <_|Nix|_> wingy: ... and another guy from RIM.
[02:47:09] <wingy> good to know there is active dev on it
[02:47:10] <_|Nix|_> wingy: JasonDScott ...
[02:47:16] <wingy> so 7
[02:47:30] <_|Nix|_> wingy: You can get all this information from the homepage, I think.
[02:47:36] <wingy> ok thx
[02:50:44] <_|Nix|_> wingy: There's definitely active dev on this project. In fact, we're about to release 1.2.0 ...
[02:50:57] <wingy> yeah i am using it atm
[02:51:02] <wingy> its way better than Sencha Touch
[02:51:06] <wingy> funny
[02:51:09] <wingy> they are having a lot of money
[02:51:16] <wingy> but their products are not as good
[02:51:29] <_|Nix|_> Open Source FTW!
[02:51:46] <wingy> yeah
[05:09:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/0MKAVA
[05:09:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (forms): changed ID of checkbox example because it was already used on another page. - Jasper de Groot
[07:24:11] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: you here?
[07:24:18] <toddmparker_> thanks for the help with the blog post
[07:24:35] <uGoMobi> I am here
[07:24:43] <uGoMobi> sure np
[07:25:21] <toddmparker_> oop, just posted a re-write of the 1.8 section to basecamp
[07:31:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yeah, looks good
[07:31:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: only not sure about last line
[07:32:33] <uGoMobi> might sound a bit like we don't care about those older platforms which is not true
[07:33:04] <toddmparker_> re-phase or delete it?
[07:33:24] <uGoMobi> I think you can just delete it
[07:33:39] <uGoMobi> don't want to offend people at RIM :)
[07:34:34] <toddmparker_> heh
[07:35:50] <toddmparker_> If you use versions 1.6.4 - 1.7.2, these will be enhanced as before
[07:35:53] <toddmparker_> ?
[07:36:06] <uGoMobi> yes sound good
[07:36:52] <toddmparker_> neutral, but clear
[07:37:07] <uGoMobi> yes, it was only the "If these platforms are important to you" part that didn't sound really nice
[07:37:13] <toddmparker_> right
[07:37:23] <toddmparker_> so we should be saying "1.6.4 - 1.8.2" everywhere
[07:37:38] <toddmparker_> docs homepage says it
[07:38:24] <uGoMobi> downside of keep supporting 1.6.4 is with code examples we have to mention bind() delegate() live() as well instead of just on()
[07:39:35] <uGoMobi> is there a reason that we want to keep supporting it?
[07:41:50] <toddmparker_> this is a good question
[07:42:28] <toddmparker_> i remember saying we'd actively support two core versions so I suppose we could deprecate 1.6. Now is the time to do it
[07:42:55] <toddmparker_> mind writing a sentence or two on this?
[07:43:12] <toddmparker_> we can discuss today
[07:45:09] <uGoMobi> write where? for in the blog post?
[07:45:19] <toddmparker_> yeah, from that perspective
[07:45:38] <toddmparker_> 1.6 still works fine, but we recommend people use 1.7+
[07:46:00] <uGoMobi> ah ok, sure
[07:46:27] <uGoMobi> I wouldn't give it too much attention because it still works
[07:47:05] <uGoMobi> it is just that we stop testing and won't fix issues that only occur if used with 1.6.4
[07:52:02] <toddmparker_> <h2>jQuery core 1.6.x: Support dropped</h2>
[07:52:02] <toddmparker_> As a project, we will always support the two most recent dot versions of jQuery core. Now that 1.8 has been out for a while, we're dropping support for 1.6.x in this release. If you use version 1.6.x, things should work fine now, but going forward, we will won't actively test 1.6.x or fix issues that <em>only</em> occur with this version.
[07:55:12] <uGoMobi> is it dangerous to promise that we always support the two most recent dot versions?
[07:56:13] <uGoMobi> it is def our intention but if they just release before our dot release or right after
[07:57:30] <uGoMobi> text looks good though
[07:58:31] <uGoMobi> maybe just leave out "most".... As a project, we will always support the two recent dot versions of jQuery core.
[07:59:01] <uGoMobi> correction As a project, we will always support two recent dot versions of jQuery core.
[07:59:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/OK1DzQ
[07:59:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs: Updated refs to final (from RC2), changed core support to 1.7.0 (from 1.6.4) - toddparker
[08:12:03] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: roadmap - shall I add "support query params" to 1.4 Ajax nav section?
[08:13:14] <toddmparker_> add it so we can discuss
[08:13:23] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:14:06] <uGoMobi> I think nested lists is another thing we need to discuss
[08:14:26] <uGoMobi> not sure where to add it
[08:14:40] <toddmparker_> <h2>Supported Platforms: Always Expanding</h2>
[08:14:40] <toddmparker_> <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/gbs"><img src="http://jquerymobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/logo_jqm-platforms.png" alt="Form widths" width="260" style="float:right; margin-left:30px; margin-top:-20px; margin-bottom:25px;" /></a>
[08:14:40] <toddmparker_> Our test lab has grown to over 70 phone, e-readers and tablets over the past few years. Luckily, our dedication to web standards and feature detection has meant that most new devices "just work" when they arrive. As of 1.2, we've added a few notable A grade platforms into testing rotation: iOS 6, Android 4.1 (Jellybean), Tizen, Firefox for Android, and Kindle Fire HD.
[08:14:40] <toddmparker_> <h2 id="changelog">Change Log for 1.2</h2>
[08:14:40] <toddmparker_> <style>
[08:14:42] <uGoMobi> anyway... it is a really nice document!
[08:15:43] <toddmparker_> oh no! sorry about that bad paste everyone
[08:15:54] <toddmparker_> As a project, we generally support the two latest major versions of jQuery core. Now that 1.8 has been out for a while, we're dropping support for 1.6.x in this release. If you use version 1.6.x, things should work fine now, but going forward, we will won't actively test 1.6.x or fix issues that <em>only</em> occur with this version.
[08:16:59] <uGoMobi> perfect
[08:17:25] <toddmparker_> cool
[08:17:59] <toddmparker_> i updated the docs for final and changed 1.6.4 to 1.7.0
[08:19:40] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw that, great
[08:20:08] <uGoMobi> ready to launch!
[08:22:40] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:23:04] <gseguin> let me know when it's tagged, I'll update the builder
[08:23:55] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin
[08:26:06] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[08:26:21] <toddmparker_> are you alls et up to update the download builder for 1.2 final?
[08:26:21] <gseguin> I found something to keep me busy: https://github.com/gseguin/node-amd-builder/issues/4
[08:26:27] <gseguin> I'll work on it tomorrow
[08:26:40] <toddmparker_> nice
[08:26:50] <toddmparker_> for 1.2, will the manual process work
[08:26:55] <gseguin> yes
[08:27:00] <toddmparker_> cool
[08:27:07] <toddmparker_> i think we could release today if we wanted
[08:27:11] <gseguin> just let me know when it's tagged
[08:28:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: gseguin : do you want to mention the download builder (beta) here http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/features.html ?
[08:28:24] <toddmparker_> good idea
[08:28:26] <gseguin> sure
[08:28:30] <toddmparker_> mind adding a link uGoMobi
[08:28:40] <uGoMobi> sure
[08:29:28] <toddmparker_> i added one here too
[08:29:29] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html
[08:30:13] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I'll make 1.2.0 the default, too
[08:30:41] <uGoMobi> I said beta, but builder is still alpha
[08:33:34] <gseguin> whatever you want to call it
[08:34:03] <gseguin> I think it's beta quality given the little amount of issues filed against it
[08:34:05] <uGoMobi> I think I just call it Download builder :)
[08:34:15] <gseguin> sounds good
[08:34:35] <uGoMobi> yeah, no real issues
[08:34:41] <uGoMobi> more server problems
[08:35:15] <toddmparker_> yeah
[08:35:22] <toddmparker_> is johnbender in the house yet?
[08:35:41] <toddmparker_> i'd like to do the deploy so we can get TR and the download builder queued up and ready
[08:35:41] <uGoMobi> when we move to new website we might want to style the builder a bit
[08:35:48] <toddmparker_> yeah :)
[08:36:02] <uGoMobi> give it a touch of JQM :)
[08:46:13] <gseguin> toddmparker_: reviewing the blog post in WP, will let you know when I'm done
[08:50:35] <toddmparker_> thanks g
[08:50:43] <toddmparker_> don't use the WYSIWYG view!!
[08:53:57] <gseguin> argh, really? why?
[08:55:11] <gseguin> ok I didn't screw it up. I added a tiny paragraph in the download builder section to let users know that the custom bundle always have the same name
[08:56:43] <gseguin> toddmparker_: maybe I spoke too fast
[08:56:56] <gseguin> there is a bunch of &#82 in the changelog
[08:56:58] <gseguin> did I do that?
[08:59:02] <toddmparker_> no, i think MaurgiceG used em dashes
[08:59:11] <toddmparker_> might be ok, but it can blow up formatting
[08:59:50] <gseguin> ok so I didn't blow up formating
[09:00:12] <gseguin> but the dashes in the changelog don't come out the intended way methinks
[09:00:12] <toddmparker_> nah
[09:00:47] <toddmparker_> looks like there are line breaks after 'em
[09:00:56] <toddmparker_> i did a find replace but they still seem to be there
[09:01:48] <gseguin> The HTML says: &amp;#82
[09:02:03] <gseguin> which I'm guessing is not what it needs to say
[09:02:45] <jzaefferer> ping johnbender - testing meeting in #jquery-meeting starting now
[09:03:26] <gseguin> toddmparker_: should be &#8212; shouldn't it
[09:04:26] <gseguin> alright, searching / replacing
[09:09:13] <gseguin> toddmparker_: done editing
[09:21:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/Ub9Y3w
[09:21:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (features): added link to Download Builder - Jasper de Groot
[09:21:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs: changed link to Download Builder to rel external. - Jasper de Groot
[09:29:47] <toddmparker_> thanks g
[09:30:49] <toddmparker_> i'm going to edit those dashes gseguin
[09:33:14] <toddmparker_> ah, i had a style block for some overrides and those get deleted when you switch to WYSIWYG mode
[09:33:19] <toddmparker_> had a copy
[09:33:43] <gseguin> sorry
[10:26:10] <toddmparker_> you here johnbender
[10:29:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I am in deed
[10:29:11] <johnbender> *indeed
[10:29:55] <toddmparker_> cool
[10:30:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Found another query-string related issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5100
[10:30:05] <toddmparker_> would you mind doing a deploy?
[10:30:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It prevents some of the nav sequence tests from working.
[10:32:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Instead of using ?push-state=false to make the push-state-disabled redirect work, can we use a cookie instead, so as to keep the URL query-string-free?
[10:32:35] * _|Nix|_ doesn't know much about cookies, but likes them, because they're sweet.
[10:34:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we can't keep it query string free
[10:34:34] <johnbender> because of test swarm
[10:34:45] <johnbender> and because people use them :/
[10:35:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: keep adding issues as you run into problems
[10:36:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, so no cookies on testswarm, eh?
[10:37:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well all the tests have to be ok with query params
[10:38:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I know, but in this case our mechanism for turning off pushState is interfering with the initial URL we wish to test.
[10:38:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, the test setup is leaking into our target.
[10:39:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Testing for URLs with query strings is something we shall have to tackle, indeed, but currently the query string bugs are preventing me from testing something unrelated.
[10:40:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But OK, I've renamed that file from blah-tests.html to blah-t35t5.html, and I'll move it back when the bugs are fixed.
[10:40:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm saying if it's a bug just log it and move on
[10:40:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: just leave it out
[10:40:46] <johnbender> once we address the test we'll come back
[10:40:59] <johnbender> I really don't want a blah-t35t5.html file in the source tree
[10:41:06] <johnbender> it's messy enough :P
[10:41:46] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'll remove the file then. I guess it's a simple enough redirect file, so we can re-create it later.
[10:43:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yar
[10:43:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: or keep a branh
[10:43:28] <johnbender> *branch
[10:44:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[10:45:00] <toddmparker_> meeting agenda here

[10:45:35] <toddmparker_> i'd like to do a 10 minute check in
[10:45:49] <toddmparker_> followed by a hangout to review the roadmap if that's ok with everyone
[10:47:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK.
[11:01:33] <toddmparker_> meeting time
[11:15:34] <toddmparker_> boom, that was fast
[11:15:47] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:15:52] <_|Nix|_> Swoosh!
[11:15:59] <toddmparker_> shall we hang?
[11:16:54] * _|Nix|_ is waiting on G+
[11:17:31] <johnbender> same
[11:17:35] <uGoMobi> me too
[11:17:56] <toddmparker_> https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/39dc1e62496cde813f22afb7c44b753e71be5b7e?hl=en-US
[11:53:40] <tybenz> toddmparker_: can you ping me when you guys are finished with the meeting?
[12:02:27] <Wilto> who said button markup
[12:06:26] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl created listview-swipe-reveal (+1 new commit): http://git.io/pX8jDQ
[12:06:26] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/listview-swipe-reveal] An experimental first-pass implementation for the listview-reveal extension. - Scott Jehl
[12:42:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: You dropped off.
[12:44:09] <toddmparker_> sorry
[12:44:12] <toddmparker_> wrapping up anyway
[12:44:25] <toddmparker_> feel free to flag features that we missed and we'll try to slot 'em in
[12:44:25] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:44:32] <uGoMobi> let's do the same next week
[12:44:36] <_|Nix|_> +1
[12:44:55] * _|Nix|_ go home now
[12:45:08] <uGoMobi> 10-15 mins update and 45 mins hangout
[12:45:27] <uGoMobi> later _|Nix|_
[13:09:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did I miss anything ground breaking?
[13:13:20] <toddmparker_> nope
[13:13:41] <toddmparker_> i ended up breaking this up a bit more and adding another release with the same scope
[13:18:04] <tybenz> toddmparker_: ping
[13:19:37] <toddmparker_> tybenz: hey!
[13:20:02] <toddmparker_> all: I ported the roadmap over to wiki format for use to refine - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Roadmap
[13:20:18] <toddmparker_> johnbender: did you do a deploy?
[13:20:28] <toddmparker_> think tybenz needs that for TR
[13:20:42] <tybenz> toddmparker_ is a mind reader
[13:20:49] <toddmparker_> :)
[14:07:50] <agcolom> Hi, I'm finally back home!
[14:09:01] <agcolom> toddmparker_: I sent you an update by email but I got an error message saying the message could not be delivered.... Just tried to send again...
[14:59:42] <agcolom> toddmparker_: well it's in the meeting notes, so I guess you got my email in the end... thank you :-)
[15:35:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm going to triage my own issues :)
[15:35:29] <johnbender> or try to get some more of that done
[23:05:47] <wingy> who initated jquery mobile project?
