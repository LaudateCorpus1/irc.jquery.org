[06:57:20] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Scott Jehl (34.86s ago): Set text-size-adjust to 100% instead of none. Fixes #4218 (re-fixes?)
[07:15:14] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: What's up?
[07:16:10] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: I see the issue.
[07:32:26] <gseguin> Good morning all
[07:32:51] <gseguin> Got pinged on twitter regarding: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4787
[07:32:52] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4787 on jquery-mobile (masatokinugawa; 4d, 6h ago): XSS with location.href behavior of some browsers
[07:33:23] <gseguin> johnbender, _|Nix|_ , uGoMobi: if you have some bandwidth: ^
[07:33:42] <gseguin> I won't be able to get to it until Wednesday
[07:42:46] <toddparker> Good morning
[07:43:06] <toddparker> gseguin: that does look…not so good
[07:43:32] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: You around?
[07:43:39] <gseguin> toddparker: I keep on bouncing the backend for the builder
[07:43:44] <toddparker> saw you comment on the nav from popup to dialog
[07:43:48] <gseguin> something is making it hang
[07:43:53] <gseguin> I don't know what yet
[07:43:54] <toddparker> hrm
[07:43:59] <toddparker> bugger
[07:44:23] <gseguin> I fixed a couple of metadata that were causing issues over the weekend but there is something else
[07:45:00] <gseguin> I can cron a bounce every couple hours for the time being
[07:48:08] <toddparker> ok
[07:50:21] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_:  Hi!  Yes it was that issue.  I just wanted to ask you before I open that issue. Thanks.
[07:58:16] <gseguin> toddparker: we're going to have to cut another alpha
[07:58:49] <gseguin> the css metadata that I fixed are one of the reasons the builder is failing
[08:08:29] <toddparker> yeah gseguin
[08:31:22] <toddparker> gseguin: do you mean alpha 2 or just to push up a new build?
[08:42:16] <gseguin> toddparker: yeah alpha.2
[08:44:20] <johnbender> gseguin: it's extremely poor taste to call that decoding bug in _browsers_ a jqm xss issue
[08:44:24] <johnbender> it is a vulnerability
[08:44:48] <johnbender> twitter communication fail :(
[08:45:54] <gseguin> johnbender: so you're saying there isn't much we can do about it?
[08:47:00] <johnbender> gseguin: no not at all
[08:47:09] <johnbender> but that's a browser xss vecotr
[08:47:15] <johnbender> we can account for it
[08:47:25] <gseguin> oh ok
[08:47:30] <johnbender> but never using location.href anywhere
[08:47:44] <johnbender> *by never using location.href anywhere
[08:47:54] <johnbender> but it's not "our bug" per se
[08:50:30] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker: I'll take care of that one today for sure
[08:51:04] <gseguin> thanks johnbender
[08:54:51] <toddparker> thanks johnbender
[08:55:13] <toddparker> i didn't know if our nav system was the place where we needed to keep an eye on that xss business
[08:58:55] <johnbender> toddparker: well this is an interesting bug given that I corrected for the selfsame issue in firefox's handling of location.hash a week ago
[08:59:06] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm going to centralize .href access to the path helper
[08:59:57] <johnbender> toddparker: though it might not be quite as easy as mala suggests
[09:00:26] <toddparker> good idea on centralizing
[09:04:17] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll post to basecamp with a heads up for the team on using .href once I'm finished
[09:27:45] <johnbender> jzaefferer: sorry to be the only red spot on the swarm server :(
[09:28:05] <johnbender> all that green is certainly pleasing to the eye no?
[09:29:22] <johnbender> uGoMobi: as far as redefining the widget factory is concerned, we could do a simple check at the top of that module and return out of the scope function
[09:30:02] <johnbender> uGoMobi: if( $.widget ) { return; }
[09:30:20] <johnbender> but we don't support the two working together right now because we'd have to manage that dependency
[09:30:33] <johnbender> among other things :/
[09:31:22] <jayant> hi, i designed a few pages for a prototype, but now i am stuck on how to make things work, i am using html canvas element and i want to a draw function on it, on touch... sorry if this is the wrong place to put a question but there is no one on jqm irc
[09:31:50] <jayant> and i am kind of a noob
[09:35:54] <johnbender> jayant: check out jquerymobile this is the dev channel for working on the library :D
[09:35:57] <johnbender> err
[09:36:00] <johnbender> #jquerymobile
[09:36:15] <johnbender> maybe #jquery ?
[09:36:17] <jayant> i tried no one there :( but anyways thanks
[09:36:30] <jayant> no one answered on jquery either
[09:36:41] <jayant> i will check out the resources no problemo :)
[09:36:45] <johnbender> jayant: it may be that your question is too general
[09:37:05] <johnbender> you're asking about canvas manipulation which isn't the really the domain of the jquery projects
[09:37:40] <johnbender> jayant: does the drawing work when you invoke it manually (eg, from the console)
[09:37:56] <jayant> no
[09:38:00] <johnbender> if it does you should be able to look at the jqm docs and figure out how to get it running based on a the tap event
[09:38:03] <jayant> i just have a skeleton so far
[09:38:07] <jayant> with 2 pages
[09:38:12] <jayant> menu and a canvas
[09:38:14] <johnbender> jayant: I would get that working first then :D
[09:38:49] <jayant> well thats working :P , i just need a bit more understanding how to make the app act
[09:38:58] <jayant> the jquery part
[09:39:09] <jayant> tried a book not usefull :|
[09:39:32] <jayant> i will just go through a few tuts and see what i come up with
[09:39:38] <jayant> thanks for your time :)
[09:41:00] <jayant> i am having a hard time making things work maybe cause of my lack of skills with jquery
[09:50:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: toddparker: do either of you have an older android device? I'm working from my dads house today in Tucson and I'm curious if `window.location.toString()` also decodes the username/pass
[10:02:49] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker: I'm going to go see batman with my dad in a half hour but Ive asked mala to see if window.location.toString() produces the issue
[10:09:49] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker: otherwise when I get back I'll just handle the issue manually

[10:17:45] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I upgraded to ICS. Can I test something on SDK?
[10:22:33] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi  In your jsbins you put the custom js in the head. This does not work for me until I put it inside the page-container
[10:26:17] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG, on what platform/browser it doesn't work?
[10:26:47] <uGoMobi> and do you mean a particular JSBin or all?
[10:32:05] <uGoMobi> johnbender: Re: redefining the widget factory... do you suggest to add that check or wait until we looked into the other issues?
[10:35:12] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Safari 5.1.7/Win  for example the last one at http://jsbin.com/atahip/44
[10:36:20] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: how do you test that one on Windows? It is a swipe test.
[10:38:34] <MauriceG> yes I've tested.  If I move the script to the body, it works also with the mouse
[10:38:38] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: ^
[10:39:29] <uGoMobi> really? I didn't know that... cool :)
[10:40:54] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  yes, that's cool for testing
[10:41:30] <uGoMobi> maybe I used on on() in the wrong way... let me check
[10:45:22] <toddparker> johnbender: i can help
[10:45:45] <toddparker> give me a test url and a version(s) to test
[11:06:21] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I made a mistake with on(), this one should work http://jsbin.com/atahip/46
[11:14:11] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: are you taking a look at that popup > dialog issue?

[11:14:21] <toddparker> pretty please :)
[12:36:32] <jzaefferer> what's with latest stable jQuery Mobile not supporting latest stable jQuery Core?
[12:58:57] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: i need to get together with johnbender and make sure we're running tests frequently
[12:59:12] <DaveMethvin> we made a change that broke mobile, they were using an undocumented feature
[12:59:21] <DaveMethvin> but we didn't realize until after the rc came out
[13:00:08] <DaveMethvin> can we do a big frequent testswarm run to check for that kind of breakage perhaps? maybe once a week or so?
[13:06:21] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: jQuery UI tests against core-git at least daily
[13:06:33] <jzaefferer> daily cronjob plus whenever you guys commit, as a down-stream project
[13:06:41] <jzaefferer> should just implement the same for mobile
[13:13:11] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'm looking at it.
[13:13:12] <bot-t> (45 hours 50 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell _|Nix|_ Gabriel, can we delete branch widget-without-container ?
[13:13:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can delete branch widget-without-container
[13:14:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In fact, I don't even have it locally anymore.
[13:58:24] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: meaning we need to set up a jquery git?
[13:58:37] <johnbender> err
[13:58:42] <johnbender> a build that uses jquery-git?
[13:59:13] * johnbender sees jzaefferer's message
[13:59:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i could have sworn the mobile unit tests supported running with jquery-git about a month ago .... was i dreaming johnbender?
[13:59:21] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: yes
[13:59:23] <johnbender> :D
[13:59:33] <DaveMethvin> a man can dream
[13:59:36] <DaveMethvin> can't he?
[13:59:53] <DaveMethvin> i think Wilto has been a bad influence on you :P
[14:03:40] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: it should be pretty trivial to just pull down jquery git and replace jquery.js for the build
[14:03:44] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I have to think about it
[14:04:02] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: let me finish dealing with this bug
[14:04:11] <johnbender> then I'll try and get that sorted
[14:25:39] <johnbender> toddparker: if you have a second it would be good to try to reproduce something
[14:27:48] <Wilto> What did I do NOW?

[14:37:11] <johnbender> toddparker: ^ when you get a chance we need to work together to test this out
[14:44:25] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: should I be pulling jquery-git.js from the cdn?
[14:44:46] <johnbender> I'll make sure our build goes after the appropriate core build
[14:44:48] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: yeah
[14:44:53] <johnbender> (in the same way the UI one does)

[15:30:46] <johnbender> toddparker: good
[15:30:55] <johnbender> toddparker: not sure how to check this location.href bug :(

[15:37:57] <toddparker> i'm heading home now anyway

[17:47:56] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: http://jsbin.com/ecocic/1/edit
[17:48:33] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: tbh I'm not sure if it's kosher to combine psuedo selectors like that (I'm under the impression it's supported)
[17:48:48] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: but I thought I would double check
[17:49:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah I think that shoudl be ok johnbender
[17:49:15] <DaveMethvin> most likely a bug in the new sizzle code
[17:49:33] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: cool, I worked around it but obviously didn't want to sweep it under the bug
