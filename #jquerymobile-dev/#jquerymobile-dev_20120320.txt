[08:12:55] <aaronmcadam> anybody know where we are with transparent bg dialogs?
[08:23:07] <aaronmcadam> getting an error with with showPageLoadingMsg: "Uncaught TypeError: Object loading has no method 'end'"
[08:23:19] <aaronmcadam> 1.1.0.rc.1
[08:24:42] <aaronmcadam> It's looking for a h1 that doesn't exist and trying to set the loading msg to it, but it's the new loading animation with no text, that must be why it's falling over
[08:38:44] <Wilto> AAAH
[08:38:47] <Wilto> I mean “hi.”
[08:40:23] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[08:40:30] <Wilto> Long morning.
[08:40:37] <aaronmcadam> I bet
[08:40:53] <Wilto> I can’t wait for this “internet” fad to be over.
[08:41:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah man
[08:41:17] <Wilto> Anyway, that’s a weird one. You mind chucking those posts into an issue real quick?
[08:41:30] <Wilto> I could take a look later on today.
[08:41:34] <aaronmcadam> Well yeah but I'm trying to pin point it
[08:41:51] <Wilto> Awesome; even better.
[08:42:33] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[08:43:21] <aaronmcadam> seems to be because I'm using show/hidePageLoading for paginating an area of a page
[08:43:40] <aaronmcadam> worked in 1.0, I'm currently uplifting
[08:45:14] <aaronmcadam> Will try to reproduce on the test jsbin
[08:47:20] <Wilto> Thanks, man!
[08:48:30] <aaronmcadam> thank /you/ Wilto :)
[08:50:26] <gseguin> morning all
[08:50:32] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: 'sup?
[09:22:01] <aaronmcadam> Wilto: do u prefer jsbins now?
[09:22:41] <Wilto> Eh, that or a fiddle—either-or.
[09:22:55] <Wilto> Seeing either one in an issue is a refreshing change of pace.
[09:25:26] <aaronmcadam> is it really still like that?
[09:25:45] <aaronmcadam> I've done a setTimeout to see, can't replicate my issue, gonna make it a proper mock ajax
[09:27:18] <aaronmcadam> cuz it didn't show without the timeout, i wonder if my ajax req is happening too quickly or something locally
[09:34:05] <aaronmcadam> ah!
[09:34:07] <aaronmcadam> got it Wilto!
[09:34:10] <fcheslack> is fixed footer navbars being off the bottom of the screen on chrome for android a known bug I'm missing or should I file?
[09:34:12] <aaronmcadam> replicated
[09:35:24] <fcheslack> (seems limited to multi-page maybe since it works on docs)
[09:35:27] <Wilto> aaronmcadam: Nice; thanks. Just a timing thing?
[09:36:02] <aaronmcadam> weird
[09:36:04] <aaronmcadam> no
[09:36:05] <aaronmcadam> it's ajax
[09:36:08] <aaronmcadam> http://jsbin.com/eyufam/112/
[09:36:34] <aaronmcadam> am i using a wrong config setting?
[09:37:36] <aaronmcadam> yeah it falls over straight away in the beforeSend
[09:37:59] <aaronmcadam> i mean, it shows the loading but falls over when it tries to hide
[09:38:12] <aaronmcadam> cuz it's looking for a h1 that doesn't exist
[09:39:02] <aaronmcadam> Here's a proper clone of the jsbin: http://jsbin.com/uximet/
[09:39:46] <aaronmcadam> Filing issue now
[09:44:57] <aaronmcadam> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3860
[09:44:58] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3860 on jquery-mobile (aaronmcadam; 2m, 53s ago): show/hidePageLoadingMsg when using ajax
[09:54:10] <Wilto> That, right there, is how issue filing is done.
[09:54:15] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm going to fire up an ice cream sandwich emulator today to work on that bug
[09:54:48] <Wilto> Todd is out there on the left coast; I think he’s mostly incommunicado today.
[09:55:14] <Wilto> johnbender: This the PhoneGap thing?
[09:55:27] <johnbender> Wilto: might be
[09:55:29] <johnbender> I think it is
[09:55:35] <johnbender> let me double check
[09:56:39] <aaronmcadam> Cool Wilto, I'll chase this up later, gotta shoot! thanks again :)
[10:29:09] <johnbender> Wilto: is toddparker traveling right now?
[10:29:33] <johnbender> I'm having a really hard time finding this issue
[10:29:37] <Wilto> Well, in meetings for the day, odds are.
[10:35:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/jmy-VQ
[10:35:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #3528 — This change seems to do away with the intermittent 1px gap above fixed headers on Android 2.2/2.3. By the looks of it this may have been a vestigial style used as a clearfix; it’s worth keeping an eye out for potentially related issues. - Mat Marquis
[10:35:50] <Wilto> Mystery fixes make me nervous.
[10:49:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/A5b57Q
[10:49:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] This change fixes #3859, in which user scaling/zoom would become re-enabled after an orientationchange, even if it was locked, such as on a fixed toolbars page. Also, this change addresses @toddparker's point that the zoom plugin does not respect meta viewport tags that have user scaling disabled at the start. This was a slightly separate issue to address, but it's all on this same ticket. lastly, this includes

[10:55:34] <johnbender> that makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside
[11:49:09] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquery: We're heading back to the Bay Area! Announcing the 2012 San Francisco jQuery Conference! http://t.co/Q7wqn4VT http://t.co/hssGEXi8 ★ http://bit.ly/GBrUZ7
[11:57:58] <Wilto> johnbender: Woah.
[11:58:53] <Wilto> That, right there, is awesome.
[14:06:48] <maxlynch> johnbender: thanks :)
[14:11:01] <gseguin> maxlynch: nice post!
[14:12:01] <gseguin> scottjehl: are you around?
[14:14:06] <maxlynch> thanks gseguin, thankful for the opportunity to be involved with jqm
[14:28:12] <johnbender> maxlynch: np np
[14:37:14] <Wilto> Oh, dude—maxlynch is right here. Yeah, awesome post.
[14:37:53] <Wilto> Hey, question for you guys. Any of you been following my <picture> crusade?
[14:39:21] <johnbender> Wilto: I have been following your tweets on the subject
[14:39:24] <maxlynch> thanks Wilto. Crayzy day
[14:39:30] <maxlynch> crazy*
[14:39:31] <Wilto> Anything about it strike you guys as needing extra explanation? I’ve been steeped in it so long that I’m certain I’m missing something.
[14:39:43] <johnbender> Wilto: can you link the proposal again?
[14:39:59] <Wilto> johnbender: http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/2012/03/07/14/ is the closest we have.
[14:40:06] <Wilto> I’m doing, like, a pseudo-spec now.
[14:40:15] <Wilto> For some mysterious and probably awesome reason.
[14:40:37] <gseguin> rwaldron: who maintains core.js in core ?
[14:41:25] <rwaldron> not sure what you mean
[14:41:35] <rwaldron> we dont have module owner ship
[14:41:45] <gseguin> oh ok, wasn't sure
[14:41:50] <rwaldron> ownership*
[14:41:59] <rwaldron> but I mean, I know a shit ton about it
[14:42:09] <gseguin> I think I may have spotted a problem with isEmptyObject
[14:42:16] <johnbender> Wilto: it seems like a client side solution makes the most sense from the practical perspective that pre fetching is generally a win and the browser has all the information
[14:42:22] <rwaldron> lay it on me
[14:42:24] <johnbender> http is supposed to be stateless
[14:42:25] <rwaldron> but be warned
[14:42:34] <rwaldron> i'm skeptical already
[14:42:41] <rwaldron> and go!
[14:43:01] <gseguin> rwaldron: if I do: var foo = { baz: "baz" }; var bar = Object.create( foo );
[14:43:24] <gseguin> $.isEmptyObject( bar ) => false;
[14:44:00] <johnbender> Wilto: that's my response to "why not servers"
[14:44:08] <Wilto> Oh, I have ever so many.
[14:44:12] <johnbender> otherwise it makes good sense to me but I'm not a pointy tag guy
[14:44:32] <gseguin> rwaldron: bar has no property of its own
[14:44:58] <gseguin> or am I missing a documented API (that wouldn't be the first time)
[14:46:16] <rwaldron> I'm not sure I understand what's wrong here
[14:46:21] <rwaldron> wait
[14:46:23] <rwaldron> strike that
[14:46:25] <rwaldron> I'm just tired
[14:46:34] <gseguin> btw rwaldron, http://dev.jquery.com/ seems to be down
[14:46:49] <rwaldron> what is dev.jquery.com?
[14:46:54] <rwaldron> api.*
[14:47:11] <gseguin> nope, the link from jquery.com to the bug tracker
[14:47:22] <rwaldron> so, bar has a prop called baz
[14:47:30] <rwaldron> it got this property from foo
[14:48:02] <rwaldron> isEmptyObject doesnt care about hasOwnProperty
[14:48:17] <rwaldron> it should be taken literally
[14:48:25] <rwaldron> is this object empty?
[14:48:32] <rwaldron> the only thing that is empty is {}
[14:48:33] <gseguin> ok that's what I wanted to know, it's not obvious
[14:48:56] <rwaldron> cool, glad to help clarify
[14:49:03] <gseguin> thanks!
[15:05:20] <Wilto> Alright, thanks johnbender. I’ve been obsessing about this for so long that I need the occasional sanity check.
[15:05:56] <johnbender> Wilto: it makes just as much sense as the first time I read it
[15:06:03] <johnbender> :D
[15:06:43] <Wilto> Yeah, “the plan” hasn’t changed much. Which is probably a pretty good sign.
[16:29:58] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender created grunt (+1 new commit): http://git.io/b-s-Sg
[16:29:58] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/grunt] moved css and js build targets out to shell scripts, first step in grunt migration - John Bender
[16:34:33] <johnbender> gseguin: you'll be pleased to know that I've started the migration to grunt
[16:35:23] <johnbender> gseguin: Makefile -> Makefile + bash scripts -> grunt + bash scripts -> grunt + linting + require js integration + bash scripts
[16:35:49] <johnbender> gseguin: though node will be jailed inside a vm :D
[16:36:53] <gseguin> johnbender: very cool,
[16:37:25] <gseguin> I'll try to look at it tonight
[16:37:38] <johnbender> gseguin: just getting started so don't waste to much time
[16:37:42] <johnbender> gseguin: origin/grunt
[16:37:43] <gseguin> I want know what it looks like
[16:37:48] <johnbender> ah grunt you mean
[16:37:52] <johnbender> for sure
[16:37:59] <gseguin> yep
[16:38:02] <johnbender> I'm really looking forward to adding the linting to our build
[16:38:28] <johnbender> so many times I open up a file in emacs and it points out a global because of a misplaced semi
[16:38:39] <johnbender> there's really no reason for that to happen
[16:40:03] <gseguin> true
[17:32:54] <Wilto> “So many times,” you say.
[17:40:27] <aaronmcadam> Wilto: thanks for earlier. just wanted to ask about transparent bgs for dialogs, I know it's a difficult problem, any recent ideas?
[17:40:54] <Wilto> Oh, no worries, dude. Got side-tracked by some stuff today, but I’ll look into that as soon as I can.
[17:41:00] <aaronmcadam> Designer earlier pointed out that they don't really look like popups
[17:41:00] <Wilto> Tomorrow is more than likely.
[17:41:17] <aaronmcadam> Wilto: I sorted it, john responded to me on that ajax issue
[17:41:19] <Wilto> Oh, wait, layered over the previous page you mean?
[17:41:22] <aaronmcadam> yep
[17:41:30] <Wilto> Ah, yeah, that’s a trickier one.
[17:41:34] <aaronmcadam> I know Scott was talking about it
[17:41:45] <Wilto> Yeah, we’ve been throwing that idea around. It’s doable for sure.
[17:41:51] <aaronmcadam> great :)
[17:41:56] <aaronmcadam> any idea on roadmap? 1.2?
[17:42:14] <Wilto> Can’t really say for certain. We’re still kicking up a lot of dust around 1.1.
[17:42:24] <aaronmcadam> yeah I can imagine
[17:42:29] <Wilto> We might have an issue for it…
[17:42:40] <aaronmcadam> yeah I do remember reading one scott was commenting on
[17:43:08] <aaronmcadam> any initial ideas?
[17:43:31] <Wilto> I’d have to dig into it a bit tomorrow.
[17:43:34] <aaronmcadam> I'm thinking, because it's essentially another page really
[17:43:48] <aaronmcadam> from the framework's point of view, right
[17:44:29] <Wilto> Yeah.
[17:44:43] <aaronmcadam> difficult hehe
[17:44:53] <aaronmcadam> if you think of it could u mention me on the issue?
[17:45:28] <Wilto> I’m just reluctant to dig into anything that touches transitions while we’re in flux, but I’ll take a look for sure.
[17:45:33] <Wilto> Will do, man.
[17:45:47] <aaronmcadam> yeah, that makes sense
[17:45:49] <aaronmcadam> thanks a lot :)
[17:46:17] <Wilto> No problem. Sneaking out again; have a good one.
[17:46:33] <aaronmcadam> you too :)
