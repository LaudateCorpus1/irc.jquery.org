[03:45:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/4ZazDQ
[03:45:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added an optional 1.0-style loading box design, configurable via a new loadingMessageTextVisible option, which defaults to false for regular loading messages, but is true for internal error messages. In order to support this change, the show loader method was modified with 3 arguments: theme, text, and text-only. Other new core options have been added to configure the theme for default and error message boxe
[03:45:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge remote branch 'origin/master' - scottjehl
[04:35:02] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/aac7yQ
[04:35:02] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Implemented and documented the tapToggleBlacklist option of the fixedtoolbar plugin, which tells the plugin to ignore certain targets for tap toggling the toolbars. The default list is "a, input, select, textarea, .ui-header-fixed, .ui-footer-fixed". - scottjehl

[05:39:51] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Undoing one of my earilier changes to remove a jump-to-top that commonly happened at the start of transitions, - scottjehl
[08:01:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: bisect?
[08:01:24] <bot-t> (14 hours 50 mins ago) <danheberden> tell johnbender - you mind if i add your ssh key to the infra repo's wiki?
[08:01:45] <johnbender> danheberden: you are welcome to add my key to the repos wiki
[08:02:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: on the transitions maybe a bisect will help you find the change?
[08:09:33] <johnbender> yah, github is not working lol
[08:12:42] <Wilto> github is what
[08:12:56] <johnbender> Wilto: pushes to github aren't working
[08:13:01] <Wilto> oh no oh god what do i do without github
[08:13:44] <Wilto> [ cue: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW3aCuxY1DY ]
[09:13:28] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I don't have very good news
[09:13:32] <gseguin> http://vimeo.com/35759264
[09:14:23] <Wilto> Todd’s out at a meeting, so I’m in charge of receiving bad news/weeping quietly at my desk.
[09:14:46] <gseguin> Wilto: did you check out the video?
[09:15:25] <Wilto> …holy hell.
[09:15:46] <gseguin> yeah
[09:16:10] <gseguin> we've missed something methinks
[09:16:14] <Wilto> I mean… I dunno.
[09:16:39] <Wilto> We have so much going on, y’know? I mean, anything that impacts the rendering engine is a factor.
[09:16:53] <Wilto> Box shadows, rounded corners, gradients, page content, etc.
[09:20:38] <Wilto> I mean, even just code-wise: we’re heavier. I don’t know that there’s a lot more we can do.
[09:20:58] <Wilto> On the other side of the coin: we support like thirty mobile platforms. Sooo…
[09:22:06] <gseguin> Yeah, I just think that if they look that good on my phone's ICS we can probably improve something
[09:22:27] <Wilto> Which is not to rule out the idea that they found something we didn’t, of course.
[09:25:42] <Wilto> Mayhap I will perform some _corporate espionage_ today, to see if they don’t have some trick we’ve missed.
[09:26:12] <Wilto> [ Read: “look at Sencha for a minute.” ]
[09:26:46] <gseguin> :) Look like they're using css transform
[09:26:58] <gseguin> but I didn't spend too much time on it
[09:27:10] <gseguin> I have to go back to my Jive tasks
[09:27:25] <Wilto> No worries, dude. Thanks for the heads-up!
[09:27:40] <gseguin> let me know if you guys find something
[09:27:55] <Wilto> Will do.
[09:28:17] <danheberden> gseguin do you know zack manning?
[09:28:41] <gseguin> danheberden: not personally but I know he's a Jiver
[09:29:07] <gseguin> why?
[09:29:26] <gseguin> Wilto: check their fixed toolbar too
[09:29:28] <danheberden> he was giving me the 'you should work at jive' poke and prod last night
[09:29:37] <Wilto> Aw man, that too?
[09:29:39] <danheberden> just curious if you knew him
[09:29:55] <gseguin> danheberden: I second him on that ;)
[09:30:10] <danheberden> then he said 'java'
[09:30:14] <danheberden> with no 'script' at the end
[09:30:20] <danheberden> and i had to spit up my beer
[09:30:42] <gseguin> oh man! yeah I understand...
[09:31:30] <Wilto> They make a non-script kind of Java now?
[09:31:53] <Wilto> Man. That must be so fast and efficient!
[09:33:23] <Wilto> We should use that.
[09:34:33] <gseguin> yeah, JavaFX is the future, JavaScript is such a toy language
[09:35:03] <gseguin> oh man! and we missed the JavaScript weekly... :(
[09:35:21] <gseguin> alright enough bad news for the day, it's sun shiny outside
[09:37:45] <johnbender> gseguin: which video?
[09:38:18] <johnbender> danheberden: aww don't hate on java
[09:38:32] <johnbender> we need to get everyone off the hate on java bandwagon
[09:38:34] <johnbender> it's stilly
[09:38:36] <johnbender> *silly
[09:38:53] <Wilto> I had a Bad Experience™, is all I’m sayin’.
[09:39:05] <danheberden> "show me on the kernel where Java touched you"
[09:39:30] <DaveMethvin> lol @ danheberden
[09:40:54] <DaveMethvin> gseguin: your videos make me sad, was that with the latest builds?
[09:41:33] <johnbender> gseguin: I was just about to bag on javascript weekly when it alerted me to oreilly's new js conf which I will now be submitting a proposal to
[09:42:03] <johnbender> gseguin: look at that "Mobile app development" what a surprise
[09:44:10] <Wilto> I sure hope someone starts up a _new_ weekly curated JavaScript round-up thing, possibly for a major web publication.
[09:44:33] <Wilto> I hope it is going to be curated by someone who is charming and handsome and going to get another cup of coffee brb.
[09:51:34] <jzaefferer> hey gseguin and/or Wilto, how is that Sencha/ICS video bad news?
[09:51:51] <jzaefferer> isn't that showing that there's still potential?
[09:51:54] <Wilto> They’re mo’ smoother.
[09:52:14] <jzaefferer> That's better then them also being really choppy
[09:52:19] <gseguin> jzaefferer: it's bad news in the sense that our fight is not over
[09:52:21] <Wilto> Yeah, that’s kinda where I’m at. If we can’t get it to that point, it’s like “I guess we make up for it by supporting ALL THE THINGS.”
[09:52:23] <jzaefferer> as that would mean, there's nothing you can do about it
[09:52:34] <Wilto> However, it does mean that maybe we can improve further.
[09:53:37] <jzaefferer> Yeah, and that's a good thing
[09:53:47] <jzaefferer> We, well, you can do this!
[09:54:10] <DaveMethvin> gseguin: do you have a link to the url where you were doing the testing? I'd kinda be interested in doing some profiling
[09:54:14] <Wilto> NOT WITHOUT YOU, JÖRN
[09:54:18] <Wilto> GET IN THERE GO GO GO
[09:54:32] <jzaefferer> Are you recruiting me for espionage?
[09:54:47] * gseguin finds the url
[09:54:49] <jzaefferer> I don't want to end up like Julian Assange :p
[09:55:14] <johnbender> I still don't have a link to this video
[09:55:27] <gseguin> sorry johnbender
[09:55:33] <johnbender> lol
[09:55:36] <gseguin> johnbender: http://vimeo.com/35759264
[09:55:45] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/touch/examples/kitchensink/
[09:55:48] <johnbender> that was such an asshole way to put it
[09:56:13] <gseguin> johnbender: that's because you're not using IRCCloud ;)
[09:56:35] <DaveMethvin> oh gseguin i meant to ask for the link to the jqm videos to profile them, sorry
[09:56:42] <johnbender> are we surprise their transitions are better?
[09:56:52] <DaveMethvin> well, to be clear, the link to the pages you used to record the jqm videos :P
[09:56:54] <johnbender> I would imagine that scrollview has an enormous impact on that no?
[09:56:55] <Wilto> Nah.
[09:57:13] <johnbender> we're just "doing more" at transition time
[09:57:20] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: that would be jquerymobile.com/test
[09:57:28] <DaveMethvin> ok, thanks
[09:57:39] <johnbender> though I think what Wilto pointed out makes sense too
[09:57:47] <johnbender> if we get rid of all the extra styling
[09:57:54] <johnbender> we might be better off
[09:58:10] <johnbender> gseguin: was there a flash/jump on the first transition in the video or is that just me
[09:59:23] <gseguin> maybe a tiny one yeah
[10:03:23] <Wilto> Yeah, I saw that too.
[10:08:35] <Wilto> I dunno. I think we’re pretty damn good place with transitions, all things considered.
[10:10:41] <DaveMethvin> looks like a LOT of time is spent in resetActivePageHeight during transitions, that's what comes up at the top of the profiler in Chrome ... a bit different in Safari but their profiler is sooo much harder to decypher
[10:10:44] <gseguin> Galaxy Nexus is not working so well: http://vimeo.com/35762692
[10:11:41] <gseguin> not that the Galaxy Nexus is running 4.0.2 and my Vibrant is running 4.0.3
[10:12:03] <johnbender> gseguin: brutal
[10:12:27] <gseguin> indeed
[10:12:52] <Wilto> Eesh.
[10:12:54] <gseguin> I'm curious how well their transition work on 2.2+
[10:17:08] <jzaefferer> why is it that jquerymobile.com is a desktop site?
[10:17:24] <jzaefferer> needs moar media queries!
[10:17:54] <johnbender> jzaefferer: what screen width are you viewing it at?
[10:18:03] <Wilto> That does kinda drive me insane, jzaefferer.
[10:18:11] * johnbender must not understand the implication
[10:18:20] <jzaefferer> well, both /test and /demos fail to open a single subpage
[10:18:28] <Wilto> Woah wait what.
[10:18:35] <jzaefferer> 4.0.3
[10:18:52] <jzaefferer> Dunno about transitions, it just breaks alltogether
[10:19:18] <Wilto> jzaefferer: http://wil.to/_/nope.gif
[10:20:08] <jzaefferer> Wilto: that's funny and sad
[10:20:20] <Wilto> You leave my denial alone. I like it here.
[10:20:40] <jzaefferer> This time I saw a loading indicator
[10:20:50] <jzaefferer> then I got stuck at the top of the frontpage, no scrolling down
[10:21:04] <jzaefferer> then a few seconds later there was a smooth slidein of the new page
[10:21:15] <jzaefferer> What is going on here?
[10:21:20] <Wilto> Good question.
[10:21:42] <jzaefferer> "back" yields another fuckupped state, then after a few seconds, a smooth animation back to the frontpage
[10:21:50] <jzaefferer> that doesn't look like transitions are the problem
[10:21:58] <jzaefferer> but something is happening inbetween
[10:22:10] <jzaefferer> maybe what DaveMethvin said earlier
[10:22:21] <jzaefferer> "looks like a LOT of time is spent in resetActivePageHeight during transitions, that's what comes up at the top of the profiler in Chrome"
[10:22:40] <jzaefferer> if Chrome spends time on that, a few seconds on Android seem about proportional
[10:22:57] <jzaefferer> which would also explain why transitions on Sencha look fine
[10:23:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's just SOOO much easier to profile this stuff on the desktop, at least it tells you a bit about where the hotspots are even if it doesn't translate exactly
[10:24:00] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: do you have a filename/linenumber?
[10:24:08] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: from our work "doesn't translate exactly" is an understatement
[10:24:33] <johnbender> it completely hides issues you might otherwise see
[10:24:37] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: i dont have location since the test file was combined
[10:24:49] <DaveMethvin> but it shoudl be easy to find
[10:25:23] <Wilto> jzaefferer: I don’t know what could be causing that delay in there. Watching videos, there is a pretty beastly lag between pages on Android.
[10:25:46] <johnbender> Wilto: start the binary css commenting
[10:26:12] <Wilto> johnbender: See previous gif.
[10:27:40] <Wilto> …Could it be something in the recent orientation detection changes?
[10:27:50] <Wilto> I mean, resetActivePageHeight doesn’t do a hell of a lot.
[10:28:05] <Wilto> Calls getScreenHeight(), though.
[10:28:45] <Wilto> Hm, no, I don’t think that would be it… I got nothin’.
[10:30:45] <johnbender> Wilto: bisect away sir
[10:31:01] <johnbender> Wilto: try out the commits right after the merge of the transitions branch
[10:31:10] <johnbender> (or after that if you guys made improvements]
[10:31:17] <johnbender> s/]/)/
[10:31:22] <Wilto> Okaaay…
[10:31:32] <Wilto> Though I don’t know that we were seeing it on our devices.
[10:31:35] <Wilto> Hang on.
[10:32:24] <jzaefferer> So, testing master locally
[10:32:26] <Wilto> Had to go find a two-wheeler so I could haul the Xoom over to my desk. I think I pulled a muscle.
[10:32:34] <jzaefferer> Transitions itself, the animations, look great
[10:32:50] <jzaefferer> which wasn't clear from the videos due to their generally choppiness
[10:32:51] <gseguin> Wilto: lol
[10:32:52] <Wilto> …“But?”
[10:33:07] <jzaefferer> but the lag intbetween is there
[10:34:08] <Wilto> Hm. jzaefferer, how does http://wil.to/4g look?
[10:35:01] <Wilto> I will accept anything from “dope” to “mad fresh.”
[10:37:05] <jzaefferer> Pretty much the same
[10:37:12] <jzaefferer> Huge delay, then smooth animated transition
[10:37:28] <jzaefferer> Almost 10 seconds inbetween
[10:37:31] <jzaefferer> back and forward
[10:37:41] <Wilto> I can’t reproduce on anything here.
[10:38:42] <jzaefferer> *insert rickroll here*
[10:39:00] <Wilto> …I think there’s a Verizon store around the corner, though.
[10:39:00] <jzaefferer> let's see if Weinre can provide any help
[10:39:07] <jzaefferer> wanted to try that for some time anyway
[10:40:37] <Wilto> Jörn has joined the party!
[10:42:07] <Wilto> gseguin: What version of IBS [sic] is on your Nexus?
[10:42:27] <gseguin> Wilto: 4.0.2
[10:43:01] <Wilto> so help me if the difference is 4.0.2 vs. 4.0.3 i am quitting websites, moving to new hampshire, and becoming a shepherd.
[10:48:24] <jzaefferer> Weinre gives you a frickin timeline view into your stupid mobile webkit
[10:48:31] <jzaefferer> editing a screenshot......
[10:49:29] <jzaefferer> Wilto gseguin: https://skitch.com/jzaefferer/ghq1u/weinre-web-inspector-remote
[10:51:54] <Wilto> FFFFFFFFF
[10:52:25] <jzaefferer> as far as I can tell, Weinre doesn't change the behaviour
[10:52:42] <Wilto> Heh. “Weinre.”
[10:52:55] <jzaefferer> yeah, silly name
[10:53:07] <jzaefferer> but hey, if it helps venting off your Android anger, why not?
[10:53:09] <Wilto> I’m gonna go out on a limb and say we don’t have much way of reducing the amount of nothing Android is doing, there.
[10:53:21] <Wilto> Whatever gets me through the day, jzaefferer.
[10:53:28] <jzaefferer> Any clue what that hashchange event might be doing?
[10:53:40] <jzaefferer> Remember how Android 4 doesn't support history.pushState?
[10:54:25] <jzaefferer> I end up with hashed urls, like /jquery-mobile/#/jquery-mobile/docs/pages/index.html
[10:54:45] <Wilto> That’s a little outside of my wheelhouse.
[10:55:02] <jzaefferer> it doesn't ever seem to change that to anything else
[10:55:14] <jzaefferer> that is, I navigate to other URLs, but that hash stays
[10:55:44] <jzaefferer> so what, do I need to ship my Nexus S to east asia now, for Mr. H
[10:55:50] <jzaefferer> *Mr. Jehl to fix it?
[10:55:57] <jzaefferer> *fix the issue
[10:56:03] <Wilto> Y
[10:56:18] <Wilto> Nah, let me take a quick look…
[10:58:00] <Wilto> Everything seems fine on Honeycomb, which is about the extent I’m able to test…
[10:58:06] <jzaefferer> A refresh loads the right page
[10:58:06] <Wilto> Can you try something for me, jzaefferer?
[10:58:26] <jzaefferer> guess the broken pushState support also affects hashchange
[10:58:30] <jzaefferer> it like iOS 4.1 all over again
[10:58:35] <jzaefferer> or Blackberry Playbook
[10:58:49] <toddmparker_> if kinblas or johnbender are on, they are both very familiar with the pushstate stuff
[10:59:18] <toddmparker_> we wrote this so replacestate is just an enhancement layer
[10:59:36] <toddmparker_> for browsers that don't support it like iOS4, they just get uglier hash urls
[10:59:52] <Wilto> jzaefferer: If you disable pushstate, does the lag go away?
[11:00:06] <toddmparker_> good diagnostic to try Wilto
[11:00:23] <jzaefferer> how?
[11:00:28] <Wilto> Alternately, try punching your phone.
[11:00:29] <jzaefferer> how to disable pushState
[11:00:50] <Wilto> Also with punching.
[11:01:20] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[11:01:27] <Wilto> jquery.mobile.core.js : pushStateEnabled: true, --> pushStateEnabled: false,
[11:01:36] <Wilto> Line ~67.
[11:01:46] <toddmparker_> view the source of this: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/config/pushState.html
[11:01:54] <toddmparker_> or just edit globalconfig
[11:02:46] <toddmparker_> something is busted for me on that link in chrome
[11:02:49] <toddmparker_> page disappears
[11:03:20] <Wilto> Something is rotten in the pushstate of Denmark.
[11:03:35] <jzaefferer> so $.support.pushState is logged as false
[11:03:43] <Wilto> I’m seeing the same thing toddmparker_ is, now.
[11:05:17] <jzaefferer> jquery.mobile.navigation.js is wicked
[11:05:25] <Wilto> …wicked good?
[11:05:40] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:05:58] <toddmparker_> so i just checked locally with master and the problem isn't there
[11:06:09] <toddmparker_> this confirms my hunch that test is still wacked out
[11:06:16] <toddmparker_> johnbender: you around?
[11:06:35] <toddmparker_> jzaefferer: definitely test locally
[11:06:57] <jzaefferer> toddmparker_: locally against master I just pulled
[11:07:19] <Wilto> Could be a timing thing.
[11:07:28] <Wilto> Feels timing-y anyway.
[11:07:38] <Wilto> So I could see where there’s a variance between local and /test
[11:08:07] <Wilto> I am going to go get a sandwich and meditate on this.
[11:08:10] <toddmparker_> test is just wacky
[11:08:22] <toddmparker_> i've seen other issues with navigation in the last 24 hours
[11:08:27] <toddmparker_> seems like a build issue
[11:08:35] <toddmparker_> maybe a script timing thing
[11:12:40] <jzaefferer> jquery.mobile.navigation.js1360-1364
[11:12:48] <jzaefferer> what's that all about, Wilto toddmparker_?
[11:14:18] <jzaefferer> I've placed various log statements in $.mobile._handleHashChange, and it looks like all the stuff beyond that return isn't running, except when I go back
[11:15:39] <jzaefferer> going up a bit, looks like that stuff isn't supposed to run when you just tap a link
[11:16:12] <toddmparker_> man, i wish johnbender or kinblas was here
[11:16:21] <toddmparker_> theyare most familiar with the code
[11:17:14] <toddmparker_> nav is very complex stuff
[11:19:55] <jzaefferer> instrumenting transitionPages now
[11:24:36] <Dragooon> BLah
[11:26:38] <jzaefferer> now down to jquery.mobile.transition.js outInTransitionHandler
[11:28:06] <Wilto> You’re a hero, jzaefferer.
[11:29:14] <jzaefferer> well, I've got a feeling my journey will end here
[11:29:17] <jzaefferer> its like a black hole
[11:30:44] <Wilto> Like The Matrix, with very little kung fu and even less pairs of cool sunglasses.
[11:32:04] <jzaefferer> so between registering those animation callbacks and those callbacks being called, nothing happens for most of the time, then some visible animation happens
[11:32:27] <jzaefferer> so while the actual visible animation is fine, the way its set up must be badly fucked up in some way
[11:32:49] <jzaefferer> as that leaves the realm of JS, I'm pretty much lost
[11:33:17] <Wilto> So, it’s looking like it’s 100% Android’s fault, you’re saying.
[11:33:35] <jzaefferer> the keyframe stuff
[11:33:38] <jzaefferer> what's that called?
[11:33:39] <Wilto> I mean, essentially, the JS adds some classes, and those classes have keyframe animations attached.
[11:33:44] <jzaefferer> compared to sencha using css transforms?
[11:34:18] <Wilto> We still use transforms—Sencha might be using transitions instead of keyframe animations.
[11:34:39] <Wilto> But there’s not a lot of tweaking we can do in there. It might just suck at that method of CSS animation.
[11:34:39] <jzaefferer> so @…keyframes == CSS transforms?
[11:35:02] <Wilto> Transforms are the styles being animated. We both use those.
[11:35:17] <Wilto> The animation methods may be different.
[11:35:51] <jzaefferer> no idea what to try now
[11:35:57] <jzaefferer> except look at sencha css
[11:36:00] <Wilto> I think this is beyond us.
[11:36:07] <Wilto> That hashchange thing makes me very uneasy, is all.
[11:37:51] <jzaefferer> Sencha's touch event handling sucks
[11:38:02] <Wilto> You said it, not me!
[11:38:04] <jzaefferer> doesn't seem to be about the hashchange stuff
[11:38:07] <jzaefferer> as far as I can tell
[11:39:15] <jzaefferer> what's this "please provide your email address to download", its MySQL douchery all over again: http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/download/
[11:40:43] <Wilto> Hah!
[11:41:09] <jzaefferer> looks like they don't have that in CSS files
[11:41:18] <jzaefferer> all generated on the fly in src/core/Anim.js
[11:41:30] <Wilto> …what
[11:42:58] <jzaefferer> "Defines different types of animations. <strong>flip, cube, wipe</strong> animations do not work on Android."
[11:43:05] <jzaefferer> they work fine on mine
[11:43:10] <jzaefferer> those three
[11:45:12] <jzaefferer> looks to me like they don't use keyframes at all
[11:47:27] <Wilto> They might be using transitions.
[11:50:09] <jzaefferer> So, I just tried converting the fade transition to using transitions instead of keyframes, but I'm just breaking it
[11:50:24] <jzaefferer> if someone can set up a test that uses transitions, I'd be happy to test it
[11:50:32] <jzaefferer> until then, I need to get some rest...
[11:51:13] <Wilto> Thanks so much for the help, man!
[11:52:52] <toddmparker_> thanks jzaefferer
[11:53:07] <jzaefferer> do you have any standalone keyframe animations demos/tests?
[11:53:14] <jzaefferer> could see if those have the same behaviour
[11:54:48] <jzaefferer> checking http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/
[11:55:31] <Wilto> I dunno; we have so much stuff going on behind the scenes, it might not make for much of a comparison.
[11:55:45] <Wilto> That said, if _those_ lag out the same way, in no way is this our problem.
[11:58:22] <jzaefferer> well, demos on that site here are all working, but the animations are pretty choppy
[11:58:29] <jzaefferer> not helping
[12:57:13] <jzaefferer> hey Wilto, this: http://animalsbeingdicks.com/post/16521098570/skit-skat-cat
[12:57:27] <jzaefferer> don't miss the "while listening to this"
[13:16:09] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: sorry I've been afk most of the day, just been working on internal bookkeeping stuff
[13:16:19] <johnbender> travel, performance review, etc
[13:16:25] <johnbender> anything pressing?
[13:21:56] <gseguin> johnbender: /test is out of sync again
[14:10:25] <gseguin> johnbend1r: /test is out of sync again
[14:11:30] <johnbend1r> gseguin: doesn't look like it to me
[14:13:13] <gseguin> that's what toddmparker_ reported this morning
[14:13:40] <johnbend1r> gseguin: no errors and it's up to day
[14:13:42] <johnbend1r> *date
[14:13:49] <johnbend1r> toddmparker_: when was it out of sync?
[14:13:52] <johnbend1r> I can check the logs
[14:16:27] <gseguin> yeah no you're right, it's the right SHA
[14:16:32] <gseguin> I don't know then
[14:31:00] <johnbender> gseguin: checking the logs now
[14:31:03] <johnbender> NAO!
[14:32:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: if you see an issue try a refresh and let me know what you find
[14:33:37] <johnbender> gseguin: qq for you
[14:33:48] <gseguin> sure
[14:33:54] <johnbender> gseguin: the compiled/demos/ is what we want?
[14:34:07] <gseguin> indeed
[14:34:10] <johnbender> I know we create the whole site in a subdir for the delpoy
[14:34:10] <johnbender> ok
[14:34:23] <johnbender> so when I move this to jenkins next week hopefully I'll just copy that dir out
[14:34:29] <gseguin> no need to copy things around
[14:34:44] <johnbender> gseguin: we won't have to use the directory where the pull happens as the directory that's served
[14:34:51] <gseguin> we can just change the output dir for the docs target
[14:35:00] <johnbender> gseguin: if I move it to jenkins it won't be under the htdocs
[14:35:20] <johnbender> I could symlink it I suppose
[14:35:23] <johnbender> either way
[14:35:26] <johnbender> this is going to change next week
[14:35:31] <johnbender> there won't be a gap/delay
[14:35:35] <gseguin> cool
[14:35:52] <gseguin> and there won't be a need to cp specific files
[14:35:54] <johnbender> and jenkins will do our build error reporting and queueing which is what it was designed to do
[14:35:59] <johnbender> gseguin: yep
[14:36:01] <johnbender> none of that crap
[14:36:17] <gseguin> that put a smile on my face
[14:36:21] <johnbender> for serious
[14:36:48] <johnbender> that will also get me warmed up to move our test builds to the jenkins instance there too
[14:37:06] <johnbender> although that involves installing ruby on the server and I'm a bit reluctant to do that
[14:37:09] <johnbender> :(
[14:37:41] <gseguin> phantomjs
[14:37:43] <johnbender> alright switching back to my mac, just had to dive in here to check the logs
[14:38:09] <johnbender> gseguin: the only downside there is we get no browse coverage
[14:38:23] <johnbender> we've had SO many instances where it's been a discrepancy between browsers in the js
[14:38:29] <gseguin> oh that's right
[14:38:39] <johnbender> because of timing or god knows what else
[14:39:00] <johnbender> but it would sure be nice to avoid installing xvfb and all that crap
[14:40:56] <gseguin> isn't that what testswarm is about ?
[14:41:14] * gseguin has no knowledge of what it does or how it works
[14:42:19] <toddmparker_> hi guys
[14:42:22] <toddmparker_> sorry, in meetings
[14:42:24] <toddmparker_> soooo
[14:44:13] <toddmparker_> so maybe scott broke something
[14:46:30] <toddmparker_> i'm getting some odd navigation stuff happening
[14:47:14] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[14:47:21] <toddmparker_> now it's better
[14:47:56] <toddmparker_> if i went to the transitions page, clicked a transition link, sometimes it would navigate to the popup, then back by itself
[14:48:12] <toddmparker_> and otehr odd stuff - blank pages, odd nav jumps to old pages
[14:48:39] <toddmparker_> yeah, ok still happening
[14:49:08] <toddmparker_> go here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[14:50:23] <toddmparker_> johnbender and gseguin ^^
[14:50:32] <toddmparker_> on my chrome, it loads then disappears
[14:50:51] <toddmparker_> same on ios
[14:51:36] <gseguin> no issues here
[14:51:50] <toddmparker_> what?!?!
[14:51:59] <toddmparker_> impossible :)
[14:52:25] <toddmparker_> ok, refresh
[14:52:32] <toddmparker_> got to "dialogs"
[14:52:38] <toddmparker_> then back to "transitions"
[14:53:03] <gseguin> oh yeah
[14:53:18] <gseguin> something's messed up
[14:53:41] <toddmparker_> sometimes when you do stuff like that, the transitions page will load but the ajax spinner will stay up
[14:53:43] <toddmparker_> yeah
[14:53:55] <toddmparker_> if i do the same stuff locally with master, all seems ok
[14:54:16] <gseguin> I don't think it
[14:54:16] <toddmparker_> so maybe this is another script sequence/timing thing?
[14:54:20] <gseguin> 's /test
[14:54:35] <gseguin> probably
[14:54:46] <gseguin> I can try testing that tonight
[14:55:22] <toddmparker_> ok
[14:55:34] <toddmparker_> maybe we uncovered another dependency
[14:55:44] <toddmparker_> johnbender will be thrilled
[14:55:49] <gseguin> :)
[14:56:00] <toddmparker_> jzaefferer had some thoughts on nav, see above
[14:56:04] <TehShrike|Work> Hey guys, I've got a horrible horrible question!
[14:56:19] <TehShrike|Work> Has anybody that you know of tested JQM on any old Windows CE browsers?
[14:56:29] <toddmparker_> seems like the delays in ICS maybe related to the hashchange/replacestate stuff
[14:56:37] <toddmparker_> we have
[14:56:46] <toddmparker_> WinMo
[14:57:30] <TehShrike|Work> What about Windows CE 5.x?
[14:57:39] <TehShrike|Work> :-x
[15:00:07] <toddmparker_> lemme check
[15:00:44] <toddmparker_> WinMo 6.5
[15:00:53] <toddmparker_> we don't have a 5.0 device
[15:01:14] <TehShrike|Work> Fair enough.  I guess I'll report anything I can nail down.
[15:02:03] <toddmparker_> worked ok in 6.5
[15:02:13] <toddmparker_> as well as it can in that crap browser
[15:02:28] <toddmparker_> is 5 doesn't support media queries it will be C grade
[15:02:36] <TehShrike|Work> If I'm not using jQM for any UI elements, and jQM hasn't been tested on this version of IE, would I get anything different by using jQM on top of straight JQ?
[15:02:44] <TehShrike|Work> It's a really really horrible browser, yes.
[15:02:48] <TehShrike|Work> So bad.
[15:03:07] <toddmparker_> not sure i understand the Q
[15:04:05] <TehShrike|Work> Does jQM add any tweaks to say, jQuery's ajax function, to make it more likely to work on older mobile browsers?
[15:05:35] <TehShrike|Work> Or have you stuck to UI work?
[15:07:14] <toddmparker_> not really
[15:07:21] <toddmparker_> mostly UI and the nav system
[15:07:27] <toddmparker_> and touch events
[15:07:41] <toddmparker_> but if you only target that platform, jQ is all you need
[15:07:42] <TehShrike|Work> Makes sense.  Thanks!
[15:08:01] <toddmparker_> gseguin: i'm seeing most pages fail to fail or blank out on test
[15:08:02] <toddmparker_> so odd
[15:08:19] <gseguin> and that's just on /test?
[15:08:30] <toddmparker_> guessing scott made some changes recently that maybe made this issue apparent?
[15:08:36] <toddmparker_> or somebody else :)
[15:15:11] <toddmparker_> but if you can figure out why the same files are ok locally and flaky on the server, it's much appreciated...getting some Q's about broken stuff
[15:15:47] <gseguin> will try to get to it later, I have some things to finish up first
[15:37:18] <gseguin> The release effect: https://skitch.com/ghislain_seguin/gh1dt/jquery-mobile-monitor
[15:53:29] <johnbender> gseguin: toddmparker_ did we find another bug in the load seq?
[15:53:55] <gseguin> maybe, there is something weird going on
[15:54:10] <johnbender> gseguin: can you guys reproduce locally?
[15:54:25] <johnbender> has anyone tried the /js/ include to check if it's a load order issue?
[15:54:28] <gseguin> not in dev mode I believe
[15:54:41] <gseguin> I haven't spent much time on it
[15:54:48] <gseguin> no time right now
[15:55:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: were either of you guys able to get those issues locally?
[15:55:36] <johnbender> gseguin: as far as testswarm is concerned, that is indeed what test swarm is meant for
[15:56:00] <johnbender> it should let us connect a ton of devices to the test suite and it will run whenever changes are made
[15:56:11] <johnbender> though jzaefferer pointed out that browser stack does that for you without occupying a device
[15:56:15] <johnbender> so they are moving that way I think
[15:56:49] <gseguin> yup or browserling
[21:32:36] <gseguin> johnbender: ping
[22:26:20] <johnbender> gseguin: yo
[22:26:44] <gseguin> so I'm looking into the problem toddmparker_ reported
[22:26:51] <gseguin> I can reproduce locally
[22:26:55] <johnbender> ah the transitions?
[22:27:06] <johnbender> does it go away without amd?
[22:27:18] <gseguin> hmm... possible
[22:27:28] <gseguin> if you do make docs
[22:28:21] <gseguin> and then copy compiled/demos/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.css to css/themes/default
[22:28:48] <gseguin> and then open docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[22:28:55] <gseguin> that should show the problem
[22:29:35] <gseguin> actually, I just realized that page-transition is not using jquery.mobile.docs.js
[22:29:48] <gseguin> that could very well be the problem
[22:32:28] * gseguin looks into that
[22:34:18] <gseguin> ok I think I fixed it
[22:34:24] <gseguin> I'll push
[22:34:28] <johnbender> hell yah
[22:36:57] <gseguin> hmm... that doesn't make any sense
[22:37:03] * gseguin looks again
[22:41:23] <gseguin> johnbender: open http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[22:41:38] <gseguin> then open the network tab in chrome dev tool
[22:41:43] <gseguin> do a reload
[22:41:48] <gseguin> everything looks ok
[22:42:20] <gseguin> now click on "Dialogs" on the left pane
[22:42:52] <gseguin> and click back on "Page Transitions"
[22:43:01] <gseguin> now look at the network tab
[22:43:11] <gseguin> it's loading the micro modules
[23:18:48] <jzaefferer> johnbender: phantomjs is already installed on the jenkins box
[23:31:56] <johnbender> gseguin: trying
[23:32:00] <johnbender> jzaefferer: good to know
[23:32:03] <gseguin> I fixed it
[23:32:35] <gseguin> running out of battery
[23:32:38] <johnbender> ..?
[23:32:45] <gseguin> gotta go
[23:32:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 4 new commits to master: http://git.io/DkNakg
