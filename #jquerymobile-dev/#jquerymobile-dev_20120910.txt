[03:14:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: 4945: Is it kosher to use :not() in CSS? If so, we might be able to fix up https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.button.css#L4 to .ui-btn:not(li) ...
[03:15:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or maybe, instead of :not(li) we should say a.ui-btn, input.ui-btn, button.ui-btn?
[03:17:17] <_|Nix|_> That'll result in a large number of rules though, I suspect.
[06:43:55] <pangelovski> hi guys
[07:16:37] <gseguin> Happy Monday jQuery mobros!
[07:58:28] <Wilto> Whatup, guys.
[08:52:38] <uGoMobi> hello folks
[08:53:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: problem with :not() is old IE
[08:54:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and yes, the savest way is to specify all the button types because we only want to apply the margin to 'real' buttons, not list items, slider handles, etc.
[08:55:57] <uGoMobi> because select and checkbox/radio buttons are wrapped in a div we can't use > to select direct children only
[08:57:23] <uGoMobi> other solution is to make sure all buttons that shouldn't get the 5px margin left right have a margin 0 rules that override it
[09:21:33] <johnbender> heyo
[09:22:49] <johnbender> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: you can also use $.fn.not
[09:23:07] <johnbender> it would be interesting to see a performance comparison
[09:23:17] <johnbender> though I'd imagine the method would win hands down
[09:23:38] <johnbender> todd_: Wilto: any crazy bugs come in yet, or am I clear to continue my slog with IE
[09:23:41] <johnbender> gseguin: you around?
[09:23:56] <gseguin> I am, 'sup?
[09:24:13] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[09:24:25] <johnbender> ie9 occasionally fails to reload modules in the support tests
[09:24:41] <johnbender> it's more consistent on the phone
[09:24:58] <johnbender> I should say actually
[09:25:06] <johnbender> that it fails to call the require callback
[09:25:14] <gseguin> I guess you didn't find a workaround
[09:25:15] <johnbender> I think the script actually loads
[09:25:21] <johnbender> well
[09:25:23] <gseguin> could it be a bug in RequireJS ?
[09:25:24] <johnbender> I could switch back to the old way
[09:25:28] <johnbender> gseguin: maybe?
[09:25:31] <johnbender> I dunno
[09:25:42] <gseguin> did you try upgrading to the latest version of RequireJS ?
[09:25:48] <johnbender> I didn't spend too much time on it since I wanted to ask you first but I could much around a bit
[09:25:53] <johnbender> gseguin: no, I'll do that
[09:26:10] <johnbender> it would be amazing if that solved the issue :)
[09:26:11] <Wilto> johnbender: I haven’t seen any red flags.
[09:26:28] <johnbender> Wilto: hell yah
[09:26:47] <Wilto> I mean, redder than usual. Bright-red flags. On fire.
[09:33:15] <johnbender> Wilto: ... so are we headed for an RC or are we doing a second Beta :/
[09:33:32] <Wilto> I dunno, man. How you feelin’?
[09:33:59] <johnbender> I'm well, but I don't know much about the state of bug reports so I'd have a hard time applying that to the library :)
[09:34:08] <johnbender> maybe I should go take a look
[09:40:51] <johnbender> gseguin: progress at least
[09:42:16] <gseguin> oh good
[09:42:22] <gseguin> did that help?
[09:47:54] <johnbender> gseguin: it seems so
[09:48:04] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't think IE is going to play nice with these property based tests
[09:48:10] <johnbender> I might just exclude them
[09:48:16] <gseguin> yeeha!
[09:48:32] <johnbender> yah hopefully I get similar results elsewhere
[09:48:46] <johnbender> if I get ie9 rolling we might be in good shape
[09:48:49] * johnbender crosses his fingers
[09:59:02] <johnbender> Wilto: does Todd know we hav the blackberry meeting today?
[09:59:11] <Wilto> …Todd is not here.
[09:59:12] <johnbender> we've missed the last two so that wouldn't be cool this time I imagine
[09:59:16] <johnbender> :P
[09:59:16] <Wilto> Er… Hm.
[09:59:18] <johnbender> alright them
[09:59:21] <Wilto> I could fill in,
[09:59:22] <johnbender> *then
[09:59:24] <johnbender> cool
[09:59:27] <johnbender> yah I'll call in too
[09:59:31] <johnbender> though I'd imagine it'll be short
[09:59:34] <Wilto> Wait, when’s this?
[09:59:44] <Wilto> 2:00 est?
[09:59:48] <Wilto> EDT*
[10:00:01] <johnbender> yah
[10:08:52] <johnbender> gseguin: Copulate with thine settee!
[10:09:25] <gseguin> johnbender: say what?
[10:09:33] <johnbender> gseguin: Fuck your couch
[10:09:57] <johnbender> I've got it working
[10:10:19] <gseguin> YES!
[10:10:34] <johnbender> gseguin: the modules needed a cachebreaker in ie
[10:10:43] <gseguin> ha
[10:10:44] <johnbender> so I had to make an absolute ref to the file itself :(
[10:10:47] <johnbender> seems to work
[10:11:00] <gseguin> you can use urlArgs
[10:11:07] <gseguin> to set a cachebuster
[10:11:16] <gseguin> in the requirejs config
[10:11:25] <johnbender> the obj passed to require?
[10:11:29] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[10:11:41] <gseguin> urlArgs: "cacheBust="+new Date()
[10:11:48] <johnbender> gseguin: bam
[10:11:54] <johnbender> gseguin: let me try it
[10:15:18] <johnbender> gseguin: that doesn't appear to work :(

[11:01:41] <Wilto> Todd is—… on the call now this is not a helpful post.
[11:41:23] <todd_> hey all
[11:42:47] <todd_> I think we're in good shape… next stop RC1
[11:42:48] <todd_> 1
[11:42:57] <todd_> RC1, not 11 - too loud
[11:43:27] <todd_> we're only tracking these 3 issues - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=13&state=open
[11:43:56] <todd_> johnbender: this is the only one assigned to you and seems like you can't reproduce. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4946
[11:44:21] <johnbender> todd_: maybe you can try the jsbin I posted?
[11:44:24] <johnbender> todd_: just to verify
[11:44:47] <johnbender> todd_:
[11:44:49] <johnbender> http://jsbin.com/iyeruc/2
[11:44:57] <johnbender> when you click the link there it should take you to a dialog
[11:45:14] <johnbender> and then when you refresh the dialog page it should stay a dialog
[11:45:22] <todd_> johnbender: does that need to be deployed as a PG app?
[11:45:35] <todd_> or just saved to your home screen as a webview
[11:45:54] <todd_> uGoMobi: this one should be fixed for RC - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4944
[11:45:55] <johnbender> todd_: didn't check with him on that
[11:46:12] <todd_> johnbender: this was a phone gap issue, right?
[11:46:20] <todd_> Dialogue's not showing in JQM 1.2.0 beta / JQ 1.8.1 using Phonegap
[11:47:15] <todd_> that one seems a bit fuzzy
[11:48:18] <johnbender> indeed
[11:48:34] <johnbender> todd_: he means that it wasn't workin with rel=external on thel ink
[11:50:23] <johnbender> todd_: I pinged him again
[11:50:45] <todd_> ok
[11:50:59] <todd_> rel=external is odd within an app context
[11:51:15] <todd_> you can't use open a new tab like you can in safari
[11:51:29] <johnbender> todd_: or ajax=false
[11:51:31] <johnbender> either way
[11:51:35] <todd_> ya
[11:51:35] <todd_> _|Nix|_ or johnbender - this seems like an error in the popup code - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4967
[11:51:49] <todd_> seems like it might be a quick fix for RC?
[11:52:01] <todd_> any takers?
[11:52:03] <johnbender> todd_: I saw that too
[11:52:07] <johnbender> yah
[11:52:11] <johnbender> I'll deal with taht
[11:52:25] <johnbender> I think we're dumping all the config options back on the the dom element for some reason
[11:53:03] <todd_> ah, ok
[11:53:20] <todd_> assigned to you :)
[11:53:31] <todd_> this PR from MauriceG looks smart - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4973
[11:53:47] <todd_> downside is this may get wonky in IE 6-8?
[11:53:50] <johnbender> todd_: I have to ask _|Nix|_ about it though
[11:53:52] <todd_> uGoMobi: that right?
[11:53:59] <johnbender> I'm not clear on why he did that originally
[11:54:02] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you around?
[11:57:39] <johnbender> todd_: we don't do that anywhere else so far as I know so I'm assuming there was some use case he was covering
[11:57:56] <johnbender> todd_: I might comment and re-assign to him
[12:00:05] <johnbender> todd_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4967#issuecomment-8434185
[12:03:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What's up?
[12:04:02] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: see that comment link above
[12:04:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I wasn't sure if there was a reason for setting that on the element itself
[12:05:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to testswarm: http://git.io/147CKA
[12:05:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/testswarm] exempt unsupported browsers from transitions - John Bender
[12:05:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That line makes sure that the data-* attributes are in sync with the this.element.options.*
[12:05:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't think we do that anywhere else
[12:06:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and now we have to make exceptions on a case by case basis which is unfortunate
[12:06:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But we should. this.options.xxx and data-xxx should always be in sync.
[12:06:41] <johnbender> hrm
[12:06:54] <todd_> is that a larger change we should discuss and make across all widgets
[12:06:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What we should avoid is adding options too lightly.
[12:07:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: do you mean documented options or just options
[12:07:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Each option commits us to supporting changin it on the fly.
[12:07:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: only if it's documented
[12:08:07] <johnbender> though I certainly see your point
[12:08:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I dunno ... I think the options structure in the widget declaration plays a special role, and is treated specially in $.Widget.
[12:08:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: For example, some of the popup options would be better placed in something like $.mobile.popup.defaults.
[12:08:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... much like $.mobile.buttonMarkup.defaults
[12:08:45] <johnbender> indeed
[12:08:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and other such defaults.
[12:08:53] <johnbender> hmm
[12:09:19] <johnbender> so we have a choice here
[12:09:54] <johnbender> hmm
[12:09:56] <johnbender> still thinking
[12:10:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If we're going to move towards on-the-fly changeable options like UI widgets have, then we'd better move options that are not expected to change from widget to widget out of that declaration.
[12:10:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the only downside I can see there is that we'd need another extension mechanism to support the global prototype option alterations and the instance specific alterations
[12:11:26] <johnbender> maybe that's not necessary in the case of the defaults
[12:11:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We can use "mobileinit" to change the prototype option alterations.
[12:11:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... just like it's used now to change lots of configurable options.
[12:12:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm not sure what you mean, if we switched to a vanilla object on $.mobile.popup wouldn't it be global default?
[12:12:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: This is kinda like sysctl in the kernel.
[12:12:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... or not ... I'm not sure if that analogy holds.
[12:13:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What do you mean a "vanilla object"?
[12:13:08] <johnbender> $.mobile.popup.defaults
[12:13:16] <johnbender> if we just alter properties on that object
[12:13:18] <johnbender> it's global
[12:13:20] <johnbender> for all popups
[12:13:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's right. That's what I'm advocating.
[12:13:34] <johnbender> doing it on the prototype means that it's overriding
[12:13:43] <johnbender> *overrideable
[12:15:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, in the unlikely case that popup will ever have child classes ...
[12:15:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: $.mobile.popup.prototype.options.foo <= global
[12:16:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: $( "#bar" ).popup( "options", "foo", baz ); <= local/instance
[12:16:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Doesn't that mean that each instance will get a copy though?
[12:16:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: $.mobile.popup.defaults <= global, always
[12:16:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes, the get a copy but it's overriden by the local version
[12:16:54] <johnbender> *they get a copy
[12:17:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, if they get a copy, then we commit ourselves to supporting _setOption ...
[12:17:23] <johnbender> I didn't intend to spend this much time on this one point I don't think it's _that_ important
[12:17:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Then I suggest we go with $.mobile.popup.defaults
[12:18:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think you're right but I'd like to do that after the release
[12:18:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: why don't we just special case it for now and then make that switch for 1.2.1
[12:18:36] <johnbender> I can milestone it
[12:18:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[12:18:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I can make the change since I added the spurious options
[12:18:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[12:19:04] <johnbender> todd_: resolveD!
[12:19:13] <johnbender> with a capital D for who knows what reason

[12:29:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] exclude internal attributes from dom element, temp fix Fixes #4967 - John Bender
[12:30:01] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #625: FAILURE in 44 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/625/
[12:31:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... needs another '=' ...
[12:32:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The linter is not happy with ==
[12:34:06] * johnbender fails
[12:36:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It needs more '='. It's a little bland with the quantity of '=' it has right now.
[12:36:42] * johnbender adds a dash of ===
[12:36:42] <_|Nix|_> :P
[12:36:46] <johnbender> srsly
[12:36:52] <_|Nix|_> A /dash/, eh?
[12:38:02] <johnbender> :)
[12:38:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We should re-open the issue and milestone it for 1.2.1 so we don't forget to fix it for good. What say you?
[12:38:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I was going to create a new issue
[12:38:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. WORKSFORME.
[12:38:43] <johnbender> since attaching it to the bug would be confusing
[12:38:49] <johnbender> thanks for reminding me though :P
[12:39:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: As part of the final fix we should also consider moving initSelector out of each widget's options structure ...
[12:40:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... since initSelector is also not a per-instance option either.
[12:40:23] <johnbender> yah we need to talk about establishing a new convention
[12:40:31] <johnbender> we can road test it on the popup since we're seeing active work there
[12:40:31] <_|Nix|_> Egads! also not a foo either ...
[12:41:45] <_|Nix|_> *nod*

[12:46:29] <_|Nix|_> WTF O_o
[12:49:56] <_|Nix|_> OK ... got it ...
[12:51:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah, its just the data attr I assume?
[12:51:32] <johnbender> not the _setOption call?
[12:51:33] <todd_> whew, glad that's hashed out
[12:52:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah can we just move the _setOption call outside the check?
[12:52:41] <todd_> seems to me that any talk of how options work should probably happen with the ui guys…sure there are opinions/learnings
[12:52:58] <todd_> more c=more consistent we can be with the widget factory across projects the better
[12:53:00] <johnbender> todd_: well it's not options perse
[12:53:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah. I just made that change.
[12:53:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool
[12:53:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We should chain up with /all/ options.
[12:53:26] <johnbender> todd_: but we could ask them how they handle non option configuratio
[12:53:31] <johnbender> ie, what their convention is
[12:53:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Should actually be using _super there, not $.mobile.widget.prototype.
[12:53:43] <johnbender> meh
[12:53:49] <johnbender> I'd rather not fuck with it lol
[12:53:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Of course not.
[12:54:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Not for 1.2.0, anyway.
[12:54:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: IINM the UI guys are not as concerned about markup-driven enhancement as we are, so they don't really care about keeping the data-* attributes in sync with the option values.
[12:55:03] <johnbender> right
[12:55:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Doing things via data-* attributes is a jQM thing, I think.
[12:55:12] <johnbender> but I'm sure they've abstracted out constants before
[12:55:20] <johnbender> which is what I was doing with those options
[12:55:24] <johnbender> nav evens etc
[12:55:27] <johnbender> events
[12:55:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Right, yeah. For sure.
[12:57:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We should definitely sift through all our configuration options and see if we can store them more systematically, while not adding additional dependencies.
[12:57:46] <johnbender> word
[12:57:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and I include the various initSelector options in that list.
[12:58:06] <johnbender> that's exposed in couple places deliberately
[12:58:16] <johnbender> defualt inputs I think
[12:59:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Zevy7w
[12:59:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup] Restrict the application of the exclusions to the recording of the new option value in the data-* attributes. Do still chain up to mobile.widget with every option. - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:59:28] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... so much to do ... so little time ...
[13:01:47] <_|Nix|_> It's funny, if you thing about it: Any option is stored in 3 different places! 1. this.options.foo 2. this.element.attr( "data-" + $.mobile.ns + "foo" ) 3. this.element.jqmData( "foo" )
[13:02:18] <_|Nix|_> /All of these should be kept in sync!/
[13:02:30] <_|Nix|_> s/thing/think/
[13:03:11] <johnbender> I agree with that on principal but we aren't doing that today and it doesn't seem to be an issue
[13:03:16] <_|Nix|_> Now, suppose I changed, like, this.element.jqmData( "foo" ) and called refresh. Which option will refresh take?
[13:03:21] <johnbender> though I'm not as in touch with what's flowing through the tracker
[13:03:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ostensibly you should be setting it via the widget method in that case
[13:04:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Definitely, but then _setOption must work for every widget for every option.
[13:04:19] <johnbender> I agree that it's less confusing having everything just work, I'm just questioning the value to complexity/effort ratio
[13:04:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that I'm fine with
[13:05:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Scott G said it best (and I paraphrase): Options are tricky, but they're the key to great widgets.
[13:05:28] <johnbender> agreed, which means were in a good place to make changes
[13:05:32] <johnbender> we provide the minimum that works
[13:05:37] <johnbender> so we can have a conversation about what to add
[13:05:44] <johnbender> not about what to take away
[13:05:48] <johnbender> well
[13:05:57] <todd_> catching up again…
[13:05:57] <johnbender> minimum in terms of "syncing"
[13:06:10] <johnbender> we don't necessarily provide the minimum in terms of options
[13:06:18] <johnbender> though I don't think we've been too bad about that either
[13:06:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I dunno ... there's not a lot of syncing going on outside of popup.
[13:06:50] <todd_> i see, makes sense. yeah, data-options are our bag. won't see those in ui maybe ever :)
[13:06:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I get the impression that options in jQM were created for one purpose alone: To influence the creation of the widget.
[13:07:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: After the widget is created, that's it. It bears those option values until you destroy it.
[13:07:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's the point, we don't provide anything yet but the default
[13:07:58] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[13:07:59] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #627: FIXED in 8 min 21 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/627/
[13:08:04] <johnbender> meaning we're in a good position to choose how we can make it easier and if we want to at all
[13:08:17] <johnbender> we dont have to subtract anything to get where we want to be
[13:08:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: And, of course, _destroy() is not implemented in many cases either. Fortunately, remove() works in most cases, and, after we move to this._on() remove() will work even on the global handler attachments.
[13:08:21] <johnbender> we've got the basics, that's all
[13:08:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Right.
[13:09:06] <johnbender> that's better than "syncing all the things!" and then having to tell people that we don't want to support additional complexity
[13:09:09] <todd_> i see data-options as a quick want o config the init of a widget
[13:09:13] <johnbender> no one gives a shit about additional complexity on the outside
[13:09:26] <johnbender> so it's always really hard to remove them
[13:09:41] <todd_> post init, different story. uncharted territory. but having a sane approach that is applied across the library is great
[13:09:54] <johnbender> IMO core is stuck with a lot of use cases that 99.99999% of people don't care about but they can't remove them
[13:10:01] <todd_> yep
[13:10:14] <johnbender> so I'm glad we've got the minimum
[13:10:33] <johnbender> if people are _burning_ in their souls for something they can build it or ask for it and we can consider it then
[13:11:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's true. The flipside in our case is that we have nothing to remind us that adding options will cause those who have read the documentation for $.Widget to ask why they cannot set them at runtime for our widgets.
[13:11:20] <todd_> it's hard to find the simple thing that doesn't go too far
[13:11:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: those people don't exist imo :P
[13:11:46] <todd_> i'd always pick the thing that does very little but does it well and without bugs
[13:11:58] <johnbender> or the number of them compared to our user base is vanishingly small
[13:12:05] <johnbender> makin the effort not worth it
[13:12:06] <todd_> _|Nix|_: how many issues have come in on that?
[13:12:07] <johnbender> *making
[13:12:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I could be _totally_ wrong about that
[13:12:41] <johnbender> but that's my perception
[13:12:55] <todd_> i haven't seen a lot of complaints about that
[13:13:07] <todd_> or maybe i'm not recognizing them as such
[13:13:12] <_|Nix|_> todd_: There was one about changing the theme of a <button> element.
[13:13:19] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Can't do it.
[13:14:44] <_|Nix|_> Which leads me to believe that we oughta drag our heels on on-the-fly options, but we should have the infrastructure in place to make options on-the-fly-modifiable as issues arrive.
[13:15:08] <_|Nix|_> s/make options/make options easily/
[13:16:55] <_|Nix|_> So, for instance, I wouldn't mind moving popup's _setOption to mobile.widget. That'll take care of data-* attributes, and we can add the line that updates the corresponding jqmData item as well. Then, all that's left is to implement _setFoo for each widget for each option - but only if people complain that they cannot set option foo for widget bar.
[13:17:18] <_|Nix|_> ... at runtime.
[13:17:48] <_|Nix|_> ... and, we need to be warier of adding new options ...
[13:29:54] <todd_> this might be a good topic for our in-person time in october
[13:30:25] <todd_> uGoMobi: you here?
[13:30:56] <_|Nix|_> todd_: I hope I can make it.
[13:31:16] <todd_> yeah :)
[13:32:32] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Looking more likely now. My travel request was approved.
[13:33:10] <uGoMobi> i am here todd_
[13:37:16] <agcolom> Good evening all :-)
[13:39:38] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[13:39:56] <agcolom> todd_: uGoMobi : I'd be very grateful if you could check the dialog pages I made (http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dialog/index.html )
[13:40:07] <uGoMobi> agcolom: how are you and your family doing considering the circumstances?
[13:40:15] <agcolom> and from there options/methods/events
[13:41:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I can  give that a look tomorrow
[13:41:06] <agcolom> uGoMobi: My partner is in France dealing with everything. I'm here with the kids and we're ok. His dad had been ill for a very long time, and he was suffering...
[13:41:47] <agcolom> We're going over on Wednesday... might be hard when we get there for the kids... everything becomes more real then I suppose...
[13:42:13] <uGoMobi> yes, I understand
[13:42:19] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Thanks :-)
[13:42:55] <agcolom> uGoMobi: then I'll be able to link the pages up properly... feel free to make corrections if I've made mistakes :-)
[13:43:11] <agcolom> It's good to be back to "almost normal" :-)
[13:43:37] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:43:59] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: fingers crossed :-) (I still have no roommate, so you may end up with me ;-) )
[13:44:14] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:50:45] <todd_> JasonDScott: you here?
[13:51:16] <todd_> agcolom: fantastic!
[13:51:24] <JasonDScott> I am now
[13:51:43] <todd_> so sorry for your loss agcolom
[13:51:55] <todd_> hey JasonDScott - might be of interest: http://codepen.io/simurai/pen/rJwpz
[13:51:57] <agcolom> todd_:  thanks
[13:52:37] <todd_> so glad to see the dialog documented properly
[13:52:43] <todd_> can't believe we missed that
[13:52:48] <todd_> just in time for rc
[13:53:19] <agcolom> yes, uGoMobi will check it's all ok and then I can link it propoerly in the menu...
[13:53:50] <todd_> ah, i see
[13:53:55] <JasonDScott> todd_:  Ya thats pretty sweet, LDH sent that too me too. I quickly tried to port it to jqm and wasn't successfuly because how we apply the classes. I will need to circle back and try it again
[13:54:13] <todd_> JasonDScott: gotcha, oh well
[13:54:25] <agcolom> uGoMobi can check tomorrow so I can link up tomorrow evening.
[13:54:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof created fix-4945 (+1 new commit): http://git.io/PU8uig
[13:54:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fix-4945] [button css] Restrict scope of margin application to a.ui-btn, input.ui-btn, and button.ui-btn - Gabriel Schulhof
[13:54:49] <todd_> agcolom: that looks solid to me
[13:54:53] <agcolom> when is RC1 released?
[13:55:02] <todd_> unless uGoMobi objects, i'd link it up
[13:55:15] <todd_> i'd like rc1 to ship late this week
[13:55:18] <agcolom> ok
[13:55:25] <todd_> rather get it in use
[13:55:35] <johnbender> I'm seriously hoping that my wife doesn't do this trip in october it would be sooooo much fun to hang out with you guys in DC
[13:55:41] * johnbender is bumming hard core
[13:55:45] * johnbender totes
[13:55:48] <uGoMobi> todd_: no objections, all faith in agcolom and can change later if needed
[13:56:02] <agcolom> oh, no pressure then ;-)
[13:56:12] <agcolom> sure, will link up now then....
[13:57:01] <agcolom> I'll be away from Wed afternoon until sunday eve. but you've got the checklist so I guess that should be ok ;-)
[13:57:24] <agcolom> johnbender: yes fingers crossed too :-)
[13:58:50] <todd_> johnbender: :)
[14:00:02] <todd_> uGoMobi: just wondering if i should have Wilto look at any issues
[14:00:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can you please have a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4975? Did I miss anything, break anything?
[14:00:50] <todd_> that would be a good one for uGoMobi
[14:01:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: CSS is not exactly my forté ...
[14:01:30] <todd_> uGoMobi: hey, you just closed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4944
[14:01:38] <uGoMobi> todd_: _|Nix|_ : I just fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4944
[14:01:40] <todd_> nice
[14:01:46] <uGoMobi> yes, commit not showing
[14:01:49] <todd_> just saw that :)
[14:01:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: will look at the PR
[14:02:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome - on both counts!
[14:02:13] <todd_> so _|Nix|_ 's PR would fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4945
[14:02:24] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Hopefully.
[14:02:26] <todd_> and that would close out 1.2 folks
[14:02:45] <todd_> johnbender: seems like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4946
[14:02:48] <_|Nix|_> todd_: There's still 4946
[14:02:53] <todd_> …needs to wait for 1.2.1
[14:03:16] <todd_> since that guy can't answer for a bit
[14:03:23] <todd_> guess we can wait and see
[14:03:37] <todd_> _|Nix|_: struggling for clarity there
[14:04:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I m not sure of your PR works for the select and checkbox/radio
[14:04:13] <uGoMobi> those are wrapped in divs
[14:06:32] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ...
[14:06:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: div.ui-button?
[14:06:47] <_|Nix|_> I mean div.ui-btn?
[14:06:52] <_|Nix|_> Should I add that as well?
[14:07:33] <uGoMobi> div.ui-select
[14:07:57] <uGoMobi> sorry..
[14:08:05] <uGoMobi> div.ui-select .ui-btn
[14:08:27] <uGoMobi> same for checkbox/radio
[14:09:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the only button that have to be exluded fromt the grid margin rule is the listview button
[14:09:22] <johnbender> todd_: hmm
[14:09:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... which is why :not(li) would have been so nice.
[14:09:34] <johnbender> todd_: are we going to push an RC Before tomorrow?
[14:09:47] <johnbender> sounds like he can get back to us then
[14:10:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: listview buttons always have margin 0 ... I can fix this same way as the slider... increase level of specifity of that margin 0 rule for the listview button
[14:11:20] <johnbender> todd_: I asked him to stop into irc so we can makes sure it's his problem and not ours
[14:11:23] <johnbender> then we can do the RC
[14:12:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/iwokon/3 I don't see a 5px margin on the select ...
[14:12:19] <johnbender> todd_: in the meantime I'm just sloggin away on test failures in ie9 :/
[14:12:38] <johnbender> there are quite a few in navigation, though I don't think this is any cause for concern
[14:13:03] <johnbender> hopefull once that's done I can move on to actual mobile browsers :/
[14:13:07] <johnbender> *hopefully
[14:13:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the button in that select has the 5px margin
[14:13:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, there it is - I was looking at one of the inner divs. You're right.
[14:14:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but since that button is not "a" "input" or "button" it won't get margin if we pull your PR
[14:15:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know. That's why I also added  .ui-grid-[a-e] div.ui-select div.ui-btn
[14:16:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but if you have a shorted fix, please close my PR and push that instead.
[14:16:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh ok, I missed that
[14:16:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: s/shorted/shorter/
[14:16:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I haven't pushed the addition yet. You didn't miss it.
[14:18:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just pushed another commit into that PR that adds selects.
[14:18:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Looking at checkbox/radio now.
[14:18:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to fix-4945: http://git.io/ktL93g
[14:18:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fix-4945] [button css] Adding selects - Gabriel Schulhof
[14:19:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: adding this line to listview css should fix it: .ui-li.ui-btn { margin: 0; }
[14:20:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[14:22:12] <uGoMobi> testing now
[14:23:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Looking good, AFAICT.
[14:23:29] <uGoMobi> I am not sure yet actually :(
[14:24:21] <johnbender> does anyone have an iPhone developer cert/provisioning profile??

[14:24:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] added dialog pages and links to them in menu - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[14:24:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Sorry, no.
[14:24:59] <uGoMobi> johnbender: no, sorry
[14:25:14] <johnbender> my phonegap test application is downloadable everywhere but on the iphone which is all I need to test this damn bug
[14:25:21] <johnbender> or at least have someone else with a phone/tablet test it
[14:26:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/iwokon/3/ for the checkbox, the 5px rule is overridden by .ui-checkbox .ui-btn, .ui-radio .ui-btn { margin: .5em 0; text-align: left; z-index: 2; }
[14:26:38] <agcolom> johnbender: yes, but I have no idea where it is....
[14:26:49] <johnbender> agcolom: bummers
[14:26:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So it actually doesn't look too good in that grid there ...
[14:27:13] <agcolom> johnbender: I can look for it if you know where to look...
[14:27:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right :(
[14:27:22] <johnbender> agcolom: I don't :(
[14:27:26] * johnbender sighs
[14:27:28] <johnbender> so difficult
[14:27:46] <agcolom> johnbender: I can ask a friend... hold on... if he's not asleep....
[14:27:58] <johnbender> agcolom: thanks!
[14:30:40] * agcolom is waiting for her friend to respond....
[14:30:52] <johnbender> agcolom: it's not a _huge_ deal
[14:31:29] <agcolom> johnbender: do you need me to install something or do you need my details to deploy to a device?
[14:31:41] <johnbender> agcolom: one sec
[14:31:44] <johnbender> I'll send you an invite
[14:32:25] <johnbender> agcolom: actually I sent you an invite a long long time ago
[14:32:27] <johnbender> it's in the pending state
[14:32:34] <johnbender> and it doesn't look like there's anyway to remove it :(
[14:32:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to fix-4945: http://git.io/gH9hYA

[14:33:08] <johnbender> I've added you as a developer on the phonegap build application
[14:34:48] <agcolom> johnbender: I get The page you were looking for doesn't exist.
[14:34:56] <johnbender> ugh
[14:35:00] <johnbender> broken app is broken
[14:35:18] <johnbender> agcolom: screw it, we'll wait for that guy to show up
[14:36:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: With my PR the 5px margin is restored for some reason ...
[14:36:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/iwokon/5/edit
[14:36:40] <todd_> john
[14:36:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That uses my local copy of jquery.mobile.css
[14:36:54] <todd_> johnbender: nope, we can wait to see if he gets back tomorrow
[14:37:03] <todd_> i'd like to do it by thursday
[14:37:18] <johnbender> todd_: sounds good to me
[14:37:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The PR should be looking better now.
[14:37:29] <johnbender> agcolom: thanks for taking the time :)
[14:37:34] <agcolom> johnbender: ok, sorry :-(
[14:37:44] <johnbender> agcolom: not your fault lol, feggin phonegap build
[14:37:58] <agcolom> I'll get the details tomorrow in case you need it in the future
[14:38:09] <johnbender> agcolom: awwwright
[14:38:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, looks good
[14:39:06] <agcolom> johnbender: did you say there were navigation problems? I've just fixed some....
[14:39:20] <todd_> johnbender: our apple dev account expired a month ago…need to re-up
[14:39:23] <agcolom> (while adding the links to dialog by hand ;-) )
[14:39:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what do we think about the amount of code?
[14:39:47] <todd_> now that the software is in the app store, a dv account is less important to us
[14:40:02] <todd_> uGoMobi: lots of scopes in that
[14:40:09] <todd_> but i dunno how to reduce
[14:40:47] <uGoMobi> todd_: i can fix the listview with one small line
[14:41:13] <uGoMobi> but _|Nix|_ noticed there is also a conflict with checkbox/radio
[14:41:57] <uGoMobi> that could be fixed by a small adjustment to the margin rule for checkbox/radio
[14:44:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and it looks like my PR doesn't fix the checkbox either. Weird ... when I loaded jquery.mobile.css from my local copy, it worked, but when I loaded it from jquerymobile.com/branches/fix-4945/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.css it didn't work.
[14:44:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe the branch preview isn't updated yet with you latest commit?
[14:44:48] <agcolom> johnbender: I have recovered my phonegap account!
[14:45:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You may be right.
[14:45:23] <johnbender> agcolom: nice
[14:45:33] <johnbender> agcolom: do you see the project on your dashboard?
[14:45:59] <agcolom> fat finger testing?
[14:46:13] <johnbender> agcolom: ?
[14:46:43] <agcolom> that's the name of the app it says!
[14:46:52] <johnbender> agcolom: nope it should say jquerymobile docs
[14:47:05] <agcolom> jQuery Mobile Docs
[14:47:05] <agcolom> An app that redirects to jquerymobile.com/test/ for fat finger testing
[14:47:09] <johnbender> yar
[14:47:10] <johnbender> that's it
[14:47:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You're right. The branch preview wasn't there yet.
[14:47:17] <johnbender> click on that one
[14:47:38] <agcolom> yes
[14:47:40] <johnbender> agcolom: sdee how the're a red button next to ios in the middle of the page
[14:47:45] <johnbender> *see
[14:47:53] <johnbender> agcolom: we have to add the keys and what not to make that work
[14:47:55] <agcolom> done
[14:48:02] <johnbender> that's as much as I know :(
[14:48:39] <johnbender> agcolom: that drop down that says "no key selected" has a "add key" option
[14:48:46] <johnbender> in there you have to upload stuff apparently before we can build it
[14:48:55] <agcolom> ok I can have a look with my friend tomorrow
[14:49:11] <johnbender> agcolom: don't worry about it too much, that guy is supposed to stop by
[14:49:25] <agcolom> We share the same office and he's the apple developer program chief for the whole uni!
[14:50:33] <agcolom> I'm on imessage with him.... I'm asking about the key...
[14:51:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: to fix the checkbox we could change that line to...   .ui-checkbox .ui-btn, .ui-radio .ui-btn { margin-top: .5em; margin-bottom: .5em; text-align: left; z-index: 2; }
[14:52:04] <uGoMobi> instead of margin: .5m 0;
[14:53:07] <uGoMobi> s/.5m/.5em
[14:53:42] <johnbender> todd_: I just fired up the simulator in xcode too and my example works fine so we can't do anything until that guy talks to us really
[14:53:52] <johnbender> it's possible it's different on the phone itself but that seems unlikely
[14:53:57] <agcolom> johnbender: I have to wait tomorrow....
[14:54:15] <johnbender> agcolom: totally fine
[14:54:21] <johnbender> agcolom: I would hold off all together
[14:54:31] <johnbender> I don't want to put your keys anyplace shady unless necessary
[14:55:00] <agcolom> johnbender: sure ok. Thanks.
[14:55:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK then. Sounds like your fix adds much less code than mine.
[14:56:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes I think so
[14:56:50] <agcolom> BTW, I have made some corrections to some missing or incorrect navigations.... Seems all ok in the docs....
[14:57:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, great. Looks like 4945 will soon be history.
[14:57:23] <agcolom> I hope....
[14:58:20] <agcolom> johnbender: have you heard of TestFlight?
[14:58:31] <johnbender> agcolom: yes
[14:59:00] <johnbender> though this is a phonegap specific issue so I'm not sure how that works
[14:59:16] <agcolom> great for testing... Some people send me stuff to test with it... but I don't know how they do it. Really good.
[14:59:26] <johnbender> agcolom: hmm something to consider
[14:59:43] <johnbender> agcolom: just distribution
[14:59:44] <johnbender> nice
[14:59:46] <agcolom> easier to deploy to real devices....
[14:59:48] <johnbender> yah makes sense
[15:00:40] <agcolom> Ok, night time here :-) goodnight everyone :-)

[15:03:10] <agcolom> todd_: johnbender : btw will page loading widget also need to be restyled? (options/events/methods)?
[15:06:31] <todd_> i think so. ultimately, every .js file should be documented in this way
[15:06:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/KO-ouQ
[15:06:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Listview: increase level of specificity of the margin 0 rule for listview buttons to avoid margins when used in grid. Fixes #4945 - Jasper de Groot
[15:06:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Checkboxradio: removed explicit left and right margin 0 to allow margins when used in grid. - Jasper de Groot
[15:10:28] <agcolom> todd_: ok, maybe for 1.2.0 ;-)
[15:10:35] <agcolom> goodnight again
[15:10:47] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[15:12:26] <_|Nix|_> Niiiiice! 1 issue left for 1.2.0!
[15:13:48] <uGoMobi> cool
[15:25:16] <uGoMobi> todd_: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4973 - that shouldn't be a problem in IE6-8, they just ignore the rule if they don't understand the selector
