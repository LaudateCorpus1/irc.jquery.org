[04:20:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think the best person to fix it would be arschmitz, because the bug is in his h2widget code. I can probably fix it eventually, but he can most likely do it a lot faster. The basic problem is that he's passing the hash into a jQuery object, which causes a sizzle error when the hash is a dialogHashKey.
[04:22:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I have a partial fix - no more spinner, but the popup can no longer be invoked by the link when you return from api.jquerymobile.com ...
[04:22:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'll keep digging.

[04:41:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, I fixed the breakage, but we should thoroughly test whether following ID-links still works ...
[04:42:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: will test
[04:44:16] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I'll have a look.
[04:44:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: seems to work fine
[04:45:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I basically replaced $( hash ) with var hashEl; try { hashEl = $( hash ); } catch( e ) { hashEl = $(); } and then I used hashEl everywhere $( hash ) was being used directly.
[04:45:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: clever :)
[04:46:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's great potential for cleaning up code there, but then arschmitz never intended that code to be permanent - just until we get the real changes into nav.
[04:46:43] <uGoMobi> I know
[04:47:12] <uGoMobi> so it's just great that it's all working
[04:47:47] <uGoMobi> I think because of the temp solution I sometimes got an error about 'top' not being defined
[04:48:04] <uGoMobi> but it wasn't breaking the page

[04:53:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see an issue with the h2widget
[04:53:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/widgets/dialog/
[04:53:54] <uGoMobi> click on jump to section > nav to section > click return to top
[04:54:10] <uGoMobi> do that a few times for different sections
[04:54:26] <uGoMobi> now open a dialog example
[04:54:38] <uGoMobi> and close it
[04:56:55] <uGoMobi> the h2widget adds to history stack so you have to click the close button several times before it actually closes
[04:57:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: probably same for popup.. going to test that page now
[04:58:30] <uGoMobi> nah, popup is fine

[06:18:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess jump-to-ID has more implications ...
[06:19:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's probably because nav cannot find the page corresponding to the ID on the hashchange back from the dialog.
[06:20:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[06:20:50] <_|Nix|_> We may need to write a navigate handler into the demos that also has a special case for in-page IDs.

[06:30:43] <toddmparker> Hello
[06:31:09] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: Thanks for looking into that issue
[06:36:02] <toddmparker> Hi uGoMobi 
[06:36:12] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[06:36:23] <toddmparker> How goes?
[06:36:54] <uGoMobi> good, thanks
[06:37:17] <uGoMobi> I think demos are in good shape
[06:37:48] <uGoMobi> there will always be things to improve :)
[06:37:49] <toddmparker> Me too
[06:38:04] <toddmparker> Exactly
[06:38:26] <toddmparker> Glad I caught some more broken links and panels last night
[06:38:45] <toddmparker> Kept heading to bed then finding another
[06:39:21] <toddmparker> So when you made a zip local from master all links worked?
[06:39:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no, also issue with the JS
[06:40:17] <uGoMobi> saw my e-mail to johnbender ?
[06:40:40] <toddmparker> Ok so hopefully johnbender can fix those first thing 
[06:40:52] <toddmparker> Haven't checked email
[06:40:52] <uGoMobi> don't think it will be hard to fix
[06:40:59] <toddmparker> Packing for Vienna 
[06:41:01] <toddmparker> Ok
[06:41:04] <uGoMobi> ah right
[06:41:20] <toddmparker> After those fixes
[06:41:27] <toddmparker> SHIP IT
[06:41:36] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:41:51] <toddmparker> this is the best release so far I think
[06:42:08] <toddmparker> Tons of new stuff and the Denis and API sites are great
[06:42:13] <uGoMobi> yeah I am pretty excited about it
[06:42:13] <toddmparker> Demos
[06:42:43] <uGoMobi> but I also look forward to work on 1.4 and improve performance
[06:42:47] <toddmparker> We really need to deconstruct how we built the global nav panel and search
[06:42:55] <toddmparker> Both are really cool
[06:43:24] <uGoMobi> yeah there should be a "making of" demo
[06:43:24] <toddmparker> Maybe you and arschmitz can write them as articles on the learn site
[06:43:25] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:43:48] <uGoMobi> yes good idea
[06:43:58] <toddmparker> You could do search
[06:44:16] <toddmparker> And he could cover he include and path stuff
[06:44:26] <toddmparker> H2 too
[06:44:49] <uGoMobi> it's cool that our docs became more a real world site
[06:45:10] <uGoMobi> with features and all
[06:49:00] <uGoMobi> looking at a Google Glass demo vid... so cool
[06:57:06] <agcolom> toddmparker: I'm landing in Vienna at 1.50pm tomorrow
[06:57:34] <toddmparker> agcolom: I'll forward my agenda to you
[06:57:39] <agcolom> but going via Frankfurt... so I'll be leaving the house at 5.20am!!!!
[06:57:40] <toddmparker> Similar time
[06:57:55] <toddmparker> My pick for the flight home is 4:20am
[06:58:09] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: New glass video?
[06:58:30] <toddmparker> Oh, think we should add the iOS app capable meta tags
[06:58:36] <agcolom> my pick from the hotel is 8.35 am which is more civilised  :-)
[06:58:38] <toddmparker> So you can save it to home
[06:58:57] <toddmparker> Jealous agcolom 
[06:59:27] <agcolom> yes ;-) but remember I'll be up tomorrow morning at 4.15am :-)
[06:59:56] <toddmparker> True
[06:59:57] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1uyQZNg2vE
[07:00:01] <toddmparker> Congrats on the API site
[07:00:14] <toddmparker> Must feel do good to have that be official
[07:00:35] <toddmparker> Thanks for all your hard work on that
[07:00:49] <toddmparker> Never would have happened w/o you
[07:03:36] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Cool video
[07:03:52] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:03:53] <toddmparker> Actually looks useful for once
[07:04:03] <agcolom> thanks :-) Well nothing would have happened without the whole team... And it's wonderful to be part of such a fantastic project and work with such wonderful and clever people :-) And big thanks to you for being the best boss I've ever had :-)
[07:04:51] <toddmparker> Yeah, I am amazes at how incredible the mobile team is. If I don't say it enough, you all rock.
[07:05:16] <toddmparker> Lookin' at you uGoMobi 
[07:06:01] <uGoMobi> thanks... I totally agree that we have a great team
[07:10:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: when are you back from Vienna?
[07:11:03] <uGoMobi> will work on fixes for 1.3.1 first but would be nice if we could do a hangout to discuss what we are going to do for 1.4
[07:13:00] <toddmparker> Sunday night
[07:13:22] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Yeah, be good to do a planning session hangout next week
[07:14:30] <toddmparker> For 1.4, the main project for you is markup simplification, smarter CSS, less JS
[07:14:53] <toddmparker> So I'd like to start with button markup and work up
[07:44:22] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: this is your baby for 1.4
[07:44:23] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5173#issuecomment-13822108
[07:44:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah my favorite ticket
[07:45:36] <uGoMobi> removing corner classes was first step
[07:45:48] <toddmparker> yep
[07:45:53] <uGoMobi> so much more that we can reduce
[07:46:04] <toddmparker> if we can get rid of all js, i'd be happy
[07:46:29] <toddmparker> my thought is maybe we switch to people adding a bit more markup and classes manually so there is no need for decoration
[07:46:53] <toddmparker> and we consider moving the decoration into a back compat plugin if needed
[07:46:55] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:47:31] <toddmparker> eventually, we drop support for that and people need to just use the new patterns
[07:47:37] <uGoMobi> the idea should be that adding classes to container should be enough
[07:47:44] <toddmparker> exactly
[07:47:55] <uGoMobi> first we can have the JS still adding it while we deprecate 
[07:47:58] <toddmparker> would make c grade look way better too
[07:48:07] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: right, exactly

[07:48:09] <uGoMobi> and after that just put it in your markup
[07:49:24] <toddmparker> if it gets too messy to have the backcompat, then we re-name 2.0

[08:50:07] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ?
[08:50:17] <uGoMobi> there is script in there that looks for those files

[08:53:05] <uGoMobi> thought you had to merge them on master to do that.. I misunderstood

[09:32:11] <johnbender> uGoMobi: toddmparker: I believe both the zip and the compiled/demos/ folder should be sorted
[09:32:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nothing
[09:32:16] <johnbender> all set here :)
[09:32:24] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok cool
[09:32:35] <uGoMobi> I will test local build
[09:32:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Great!
[09:33:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: can you give me a link I can test?
[09:33:26] <uGoMobi> johnbender: sorry, link to what?
[09:33:26] <johnbender> uGoMobi: all the js is in there now but I still don't know which link causes the issue for sure 
[09:33:31] <johnbender> uGoMobi: in the docs
[09:33:52] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:34:00] <siovene> johnbender: hi! You can already start adding a perf suite for jqm to perfectjs :)
[09:34:28] <johnbender> siovene: one sec
[09:34:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ^ sorry now the zip is fixed
[09:35:05] <johnbender> uGoMobi: had to push my last commit
[09:35:10] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15johnbender pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/7XkfGg
[09:35:10] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14beffccf 15John Bender: fix the docs zip to include the concatenated docs js
[09:35:15] <johnbender> siovene: quick question for you
[09:35:23] <johnbender> I haven't had time to take a deep look
[09:35:24] <uGoMobi> johnbender: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/ see the widget reference menu
[09:35:38] <uGoMobi> all those links we manipulate with JS
[09:35:48] <johnbender> the lazy load just places the js include into the page when it's time for the tests to run with the corresponding version?
[09:35:57] <siovene> johnbender: yes
[09:36:06] <johnbender> siovene: alright, I'll have to try it out
[09:36:12] <johnbender> siovene: we do a bunch of stuff on load
[09:36:17] <johnbender> including binding to the page
[09:36:19] <siovene> johnbender: it seems to work, however unorthodox
[09:36:20] <johnbender> err
[09:36:22] <johnbender> document/window
[09:36:40] <johnbender> we're much more intrusive (obviously) than core is
[09:36:40] <siovene> johnbender: I think you can attach a hook for when the lazy load completes.
[09:36:44] <johnbender> siovene: right
[09:36:53] <johnbender> so that's what I was going to ask
[09:37:05] <siovene> I can add support for that to perfectjs, or you can when you run into it, it should be fairly easy
[09:37:13] <johnbender> but we'd still have to do the cleanup
[09:37:18] <johnbender> which we may fail at misserably
[09:37:35] <siovene> sounds like a good reason to improve the clean-up code :)
[09:37:38] <johnbender> miserably
[09:37:41] <johnbender> siovene
[09:37:43] <johnbender> yep
[09:37:45] <johnbender> I agree
[09:38:16] <johnbender> either way we can probably make use of what's there now for the basic tests
[09:38:16] <siovene> With perfectjs you can do stuff after the first test run completes, and before the lazyload loads the second version of the library
[09:38:44] <johnbender> siovene: the only other thing I want to monkey with is loading via requirejs
[09:38:51] <johnbender> since everything in the lib is an amd module
[09:39:03] <siovene> johnbender: I can make perfectjs amd-ready too
[09:39:14] <johnbender> siovene: cool
[09:39:25] <johnbender> siovene: I won't be able to take a look at it this week I don't think
[09:39:34] <johnbender> siovene: but if you want to fork and work on the perf branch
[09:39:35] <johnbender> feel free
[09:39:40] <johnbender> there are two basic suites in there now
[09:40:06] <siovene> johnbender: I should focus on the jquery perf tests and perfectjs itself, so I can't promise
[09:40:19] <siovene> johnbender: basically I'm trying to make it easy for you to write your own perf tests.
[09:40:32] <johnbender> siovene: alright
[09:40:42] <johnbender> when I get back to it I'll let you know how things go
[09:40:58] <siovene> johnbender: great :)
[09:41:12] <uGoMobi> johnbender: hmm I don't get it
[09:41:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: :(
[09:41:54] <uGoMobi> johnbender: is it correct that I have to run grunt docs # to build the zip
[09:41:55] <uGoMobi> ?
[09:42:05] <johnbender> uGoMobi: the docs zip? yes
[09:42:12] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:42:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi: "correct" in the sense that it's built that way
[09:42:34] <johnbender> :P
[09:42:42] <uGoMobi> in that zip not all JS is in jquery.mobile.demos.js
[09:43:06] <uGoMobi> only jqm-demos.js is included

[11:53:41] <johnbender> the zip should be fine

[12:01:07] <toddmparker> that's ok. xavier can fix if we want to remove that
[12:01:14] <toddmparker> is gseguin around?
[12:01:26] <johnbender> toddmparker: I thought it was in the js file?
[12:01:33] <uGoMobi> well annoying thing is that it uses 1.3RC1 as default

[13:02:08] <uGoMobi> sure
[13:02:42] <rxaviers> what are you running `php add_version.php 1.3.0 1.8.3`?
[13:02:48] <rxaviers> ah
[13:02:57] <rxaviers> about 1.3.0-rc.1 we need to remove the commit
[13:02:59] <rxaviers> I mean
[13:03:00] <rxaviers> revert
[13:03:18] <uGoMobi> I see
[13:03:46] <rxaviers> git revert fbe6864378c89b5430fb474a2fb7dfe62e28131d
[13:03:51] <uGoMobi> but then there is still the problem that it doesn't use the correct html for 1.3.0
[13:04:09] <rxaviers> ok let's see the html for 1.3.0
[13:04:17] <rxaviers> what does it get and what should it
[13:05:17] <uGoMobi> rxaviers: the preview.html should be same as 1.3 RC
[13:05:24] <uGoMobi> but it isn't
[13:05:42] <uGoMobi> it's old version
[13:06:12] <rxaviers> I guess the script just copy the previous-more-recent one
[13:06:37] <uGoMobi> rxaviers: ah and I deleted previous before I added new one
[13:06:46] <rxaviers> ;)
[13:06:50] <rxaviers> that's why
[13:07:05] <uGoMobi> ok let me try again
[13:07:12] <uGoMobi> rxaviers: thanks for you help so far
[13:07:14] <rxaviers> the previous times and I did it.. I've created a branch with it
[13:07:18] <rxaviers> then revert the RC
[13:07:21] <rxaviers> than land the branch
[13:07:29] <rxaviers> sure. plz just let me know in any trouble
[13:08:19] <rxaviers> I am not very expert on mob tr.. but always that I can, feel free
[13:11:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: jquerymobile.com blog is updated but homepage still says 1.3 RC1
[13:19:30] <_|Nix|_> Whew!
[13:33:17] <toddmparker> Must be cached
[13:33:29] <toddmparker> Tack a ?foo on the URL
[13:38:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: you are right.. homepage updated now too for me :)
[13:39:57] <toddmparker> very sticky cache
[13:47:57] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: remember when we talked about 2x images?
[13:47:58] <toddmparker> HTC’s new flagship One phone (sporting a 4.7-inch 1920 × 1080 display with a remarkable 468 pixels-per-inch density)
[13:48:28] <uGoMobi> wow
[13:48:55] <uGoMobi> was more talking about pc with 72ppi 
[13:48:57] <toddmparker> yep. 1080p phone displays are the new norm
[13:49:09] <toddmparker> overkill.
[13:49:19] <toddmparker> i'd rather have better battery life
[13:49:25] <uGoMobi> I agree
[13:50:08] <uGoMobi> I think that my eyes won't notice higher resolution than Retina
[13:54:41] <uGoMobi> r
[14:04:18] <_|Nix|_> Can I move the popup arrow back to being an extension, now that 1.3.0 is out?
