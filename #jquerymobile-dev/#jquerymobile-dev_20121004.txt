[04:02:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping! I still can't reproduce #5094 with http://jsbin.com/uzaret/20
[04:02:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The popup always works.
[04:06:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and the slideup transition is being rendered as fade in Chrome, because it doesn't have 3D transform.
[04:48:26] <robschmuecker> Hi All,
[04:50:17] <robschmuecker> Can anyone give a hint why a bunch of qunit tests don't run chronologocially?  I have a test file and 10 tests in there.  One fails because it is relying on some state from an "earlier" test but it seems to be called before all others?  They are just standard tests not ASYNC or anything special/

[05:04:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup unit tests] Removing sequence page -> popup1 -> dialog -> popup2 <- back <- back from popup tests, because it was moved to sequence tests - Gabriel Schulhof
[05:05:27] <_|Nix|_> robschmuecker: You cannot rely on the order of tests with qunit. If you rely on state from a previous tests, you need to copy the previous test over.
[05:05:40] <_|Nix|_> robschmuecker: You can have both tests call a common function to set up the state.
[05:22:27] <robschmuecker> _|Nix|_ Many thanks for the informative heads up.  I was using a common teardown to "reset" things, but as I was building my tests up they "seemed" to be executing in the coded order.  Now I know that they don't run in that manner I will build the tests accordingly.  Thanks again.
[05:25:13] <_|Nix|_> robschmuecker: NP.

[06:03:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: you around?
[06:07:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hey! Are we fixing the query string bugs before your refactor lands?
[06:12:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: my branch is based on my fix for the query params on a hash issue
[06:12:24] <johnbender> so yes
[06:12:27] <johnbender> I'm going to merge that first
[06:12:47] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's a "fix"
[06:13:31] <johnbender> in that it will load the appropriate page in the dom by stripping the params and then providing the absolute resolved url to the user as information in the event data
[06:13:38] <johnbender> that's how the current plugin works
[06:13:55] <johnbender> and it conforms to the existing information we provide in the page load callbacks
[06:14:07] <johnbender> well
[06:14:14] <johnbender> here I'll just link the discussion
[06:14:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5085#issuecomment-9045132
[06:27:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There's another query string bug as well, that I wouldn't mind discussing with you: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5100 ...
[06:27:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was able to fix #5100 by changing hrefNoHash to hrefNoSearch at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L261, but the same check is being performed a few lines down (L284) ...
[06:28:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, I'm wondering if it might be worth factoring out the calculation of samePath and using that in both functions.
[06:28:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and using hrefNoSearch instead ...
[06:32:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... like so: https://gist.github.com/3833539
[07:56:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... but that doesn't work, because it causes push-state-disabled-base-tests.html to never complete.
[08:06:35] <gseguin> mornin'
[08:08:31] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hey!
[08:32:56] <JasonDScott_> Morning
[08:33:01] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[08:33:17] <JasonDScott_> _|Nix|_: Hey
[09:28:16] <toddmparker_> Hi all
[09:30:25] <toddmparker_> johnbender: I'm here
[09:30:35] <toddmparker_> guess I should cook up an agenda doc
[09:52:17] <agcolom> good morning/afternoon/evening all
[09:54:57] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... a bit of a problem ... it seems that controlgroup adds ui-corner-* to its terminal buttons, rather than ui-btn-corner-* ...
[09:57:56] <_|Nix|_> When I changed buttonMarkup to also accept { corners: "left" }, it adds ui-btn-corner-left, not ui-corner-left ...
[09:58:08] <_|Nix|_> What's the difference?
[09:58:46] <_|Nix|_> It seems like ui-btn-corner-<anything-but-"all"> is not being used anywhere in the code.
[09:59:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know one case where that is used
[09:59:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Where?
[09:59:47] <uGoMobi> in listview
[09:59:59] <uGoMobi> if you use a thumbnail
[10:00:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aha, OK ...
[10:00:23] <uGoMobi> hmm, however
[10:00:36] <uGoMobi> could be it ui-corner-bl what is used there
[10:00:41] <uGoMobi> without -btn-
[10:00:55] <uGoMobi> s/it/it's
[10:01:06] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[10:01:23] <_|Nix|_> ui-btn-corner-left/top/right/bottom/tl/tr/bl/br is not being used anywhere.
[10:02:05] <_|Nix|_> So, can I use those classes in buttonMarkup instead of ui-corner-left/top/right/...
[10:02:09] <_|Nix|_> ?
[10:02:12] <uGoMobi> yes, sorry I forgot we have ui-corner and ui-btn-corner
[10:02:28] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[10:02:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: doesn't the collapsible use that class?
[10:02:51] <uGoMobi> the collapsible heading is a button
[10:03:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: find js | grep '\.js$' | xargs grep -nH --color=always 'ui-btn-corner-[^a]'
[10:03:34] <uGoMobi> and corners at the bottom when expanded
[10:03:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No result.
[10:04:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, find js | grep '\.js$' | xargs grep -nH --color=always 'ui-btn-corner-all'
[10:04:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Gives lots of results.
[10:04:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, only ui-btn-corner-all is ever used in our code.
[10:04:53] <uGoMobi> just checked, collapsible is a button but it doesn't use corner styling of a button
[10:05:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly. It seems like only ui-btn-corner-all is ever used. So, if I change buttonMarkup to accept corners: "left", that has to be ui-corner-left ...
[10:06:08] <_|Nix|_> But! corners: true is still ui-btn-corner-all
[10:06:25] <_|Nix|_> Slightly inconsistent ...
[10:06:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looks like we can drop some CSS
[10:06:38] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css#L1033
[10:07:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I bet lots of people use those classes, just not us.
[10:07:38] <_|Nix|_> What I need to know is whether we should start using them for buttonMarkup ...
[10:08:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the ui-corner class yes, but I don't think the ui-btn-corner classes (except -all) are used a lot
[10:08:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They're not used at all in our code, but I would like to use them for buttonMarkup.
[10:08:36] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:08:48] <_|Nix|_> I just dunno what the implications are.
[10:09:10] <_|Nix|_> There might be a lot of code out there expecting things like .ui-btn.ui-corner-left
[10:09:30] <_|Nix|_> And in the future it will get .ui-btn.ui-btn-corner-left, and it will fail.
[10:10:19] <uGoMobi> yes we have to keep those separated
[10:11:09] <uGoMobi> collapsible headng is good example
[10:11:42] <uGoMobi> it won't break but suddenly get a bigger radius (in case of default theme)
[10:13:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm going to push this corners: "left/top/right/bottom/tl/tr/bl/br" change with ui-corner-* except for ui-btn-corner-all, but then we need to stop adding these classes by hand, and replace all those .addClass()/.removeClass() with .buttonMarkup({corners: <whatever you need>}) all over the code.
[10:15:02] <_|Nix|_> I mean, wherever we have something that was created using .buttonMarkup(), of course.
[10:15:11] <uGoMobi> I like that change
[10:15:26] <uGoMobi> addClass is expensive isn't it?
[10:16:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No idea, but I think buttonMarkup uses el.className = ...;
[10:16:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, yeah, it's probably a lot more expensive than what buttonMarkup uses :)
[10:17:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we might have to make more changes to listview
[10:17:25] <uGoMobi> we call a function on "refresh" to update the corner styling
[10:17:47] <uGoMobi> buttonMarkup is only called on init I think
[10:18:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Please tell me we don't iterate over each item to update the corners!
[10:18:01] <uGoMobi> have to check the code
[10:18:56] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/listview.js#L59
[10:19:56] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/listview.js#L338
[10:22:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Something tells me listview will be the last widget we'll convert to calling .buttonMarkup :)
[10:22:26] <uGoMobi> we only have to look for first and last visible item
[10:22:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lol
[10:22:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's deal with the easy ones first, like collapsible :)
[10:23:21] <uGoMobi> might be a good idea :)
[10:24:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how do you deal with ui-corner-all vs. ui-btn-corner-all?
[10:25:34] <uGoMobi> when it's a regular button it needs to return the latter and when it's a collapsible for example it needs to return the first
[10:25:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, man! Really?
[10:26:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Such inconsistency may make it useless ...
[10:26:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Why can't we solve this in CSS?
[10:27:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we could, but the problem would be backward compatibility
[10:28:12] <uGoMobi> for people who use those classes in their code
[10:28:29] <toddmparker_> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SQJ2stndkz5HC5t85CgW-6x6QLcfltrbofLl97jiKuI/edit#
[10:28:33] <toddmparker_> fill 'er out
[10:29:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5100
[10:29:06] <johnbender> that's as it should be
[10:29:15] <johnbender> those are two different pages as far as we're concerned
[10:29:21] <johnbender> they have to be
[10:29:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, really? But we end up with two copies of the page in the DOM, one enhanced, one unenhanced.
[10:30:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well it should load the page twice
[10:30:16] <johnbender> but they should both be enhanced
[10:30:30] <johnbender> the url in the hash and the initial page load are two different urls
[10:30:35] <johnbender> we can't treat them as the same
[10:30:42] <johnbender> I'm adding an exception for embedded pages
[10:30:57] <johnbender> but _only_ for embedded pages
[10:31:26] <toddmparker_> looks like we need to review corner classes
[10:31:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I may might could possibly make the call
[10:31:46] <toddmparker_> the intent was corners for button-y things vs. groupings/panels/overlays
[10:31:49] <johnbender> but I'm going to be near worthless
[10:32:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_ johnbender: did you see this? http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/ uses core 1.7.1 instead of 1.8.2
[10:33:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, but then we need to figure something out for our unit tests, because the intention is to test the URL combinations under various conditions (such as pushState vs. no pushState). If the only way to re-run the same set of tests with a different pushState setting is to add a query string, then that won't work for sequence tests.
[10:33:11] <johnbender> uGoMobi: no I didn't but I'm not particularly concerned
[10:33:39] <uGoMobi> I am not concerned either
[10:33:52] <uGoMobi> but still we could update it :)
[10:33:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm not clear what you mean, the push state tests and the non push state tests are two seperate runs of the test suite
[10:34:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we don't mix them
[10:34:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: They, are, but the pushState-disabled tests are influenced by the presence of the query string in the location.
[10:34:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: in what way
[10:34:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, take the example from the URL.
[10:35:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I mean from 5100.
[10:35:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah, I see what you mean
[10:35:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well, that won't be an issue once we get testswarm in place just because they'll all have a query string
[10:35:31] <johnbender> in addition to the phantom tests
[10:35:35] <johnbender> but I'll take that fornow
[10:35:49] * johnbender waves his hands
[10:35:55] <johnbender> you can't win them all
[10:36:20] <johnbender> to be frank we're overcovered on a lot of the nav functionality
[10:37:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I dunno ... I think we've found a ton of corner cases that we must not forget.
[10:38:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I'm trying to make it so, for button-y things you don't set corners via addClass/removeClass, but via repeated calls to buttonMarkup.
[10:38:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: agreed, but I don't feel like running the test suite 3 times just to check against query params without pushstate
[10:38:26] <johnbender> I just don't care that much
[10:38:41] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: interesting. that could be a good improvment
[10:38:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: especially given that I _still_ can't get browserstack to work with our backbutton tests
[10:39:09] <johnbender> bigger fish
[10:39:11] <johnbender> bigger fish
[10:39:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Alright ... I guess ...
[10:40:03] <toddmparker_> i think having a reasonable way to track history across widgets would be a bigger win than super forward/back edge cases
[10:40:50] <toddmparker_> not saying these aren't things to try and hit, but browsers are pretty buggy with this stuff. if you go forward/back a bunch htings may get wonky
[10:42:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: The problem is that we have a lot of code that adds/removes corner classes, and does so inconsistently. If we were to replace them with calls to buttonMarkup, we'd introduce consistency, but in some cases, the classes that end up in the DOM might be different, so that might break people's selectors.
[10:42:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ... and there's no way to modify buttonMarkup to handle special cases.
[10:43:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Not without blowing up performance.
[10:43:12] <toddmparker_> right. and aren't there a lot of special cases
[10:43:29] <toddmparker_> horizontal checkboxes vs. listview corners
[10:44:11] <johnbender> yah the perf on buttonMarkup is already ugly for a couple of reasons
[10:44:22] <johnbender> primarily our insane overuse of $.fn.data
[10:44:28] <toddmparker_> right
[10:44:49] <toddmparker_> my opinion is that if we can find places to boost perf, let's do that
[10:45:10] <toddmparker_> but i'd like to keep on track for stuff we have in the 1.3 roadmap or bug fixes
[10:45:20] <johnbender> yar
[10:45:48] <toddmparker_> if we're working on stuff, it should be in those buckets so we can get releases out sooner
[10:46:01] <toddmparker_> if htis is important, let's add a ticket with details and slot it in
[10:48:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, I don't get why we have to store the buttonMarkup options in two places (DOM and data) ...
[10:49:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: neither do I
[10:49:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we'll figure that out at some point
[10:49:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you have an agenda doc?
[10:49:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I want to write my contribution in there for this week if nothing gelse
[10:49:36] <johnbender> about to shower and pass out

[11:39:16] <toddmparker_> uh, ok
[11:39:22] <toddmparker_> mobile or core?
[11:44:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: core
[11:44:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's actually not that urgent but it would be a gigantic help
[11:44:43] <johnbender> we've done this dance once before but I can't find a vector veresion
[11:44:48] <johnbender> *version
[11:44:50] <toddmparker_> think you can grab if off google
[11:44:57] <gseguin> G+ hangout?

[11:48:48] <agcolom> Can't see the hangout!
[11:49:09] <toddmparker_> there isn't one (yet)
[11:49:52] <gseguin> I started a hangout
[11:50:00] <gseguin> toddmparker_: did you start one as well ?

[11:50:31] <toddmparker_> we can use either
[11:50:35] <gseguin> that's ok
[11:50:41] <gseguin> we're joining yours

[13:24:26] <toddmparker_> hey all, back
[13:24:34] <ryanneufeld_> do you guys need a playbook for deving?
[13:24:43] <toddmparker_> i'm going to undo that change I made to the tables for DC
[13:25:11] <ryanneufeld_> I got one at the conf, but I don't ever use it. If you guys can make use of it, I'll bring it for you to the summit
[13:26:49] <toddmparker_> ryanneufeld_: sure, I bet someone on the team would love that
[13:27:22] <ryanneufeld_> It's a rare time when I have useful hardware to donate, so why not
[13:28:23] <toddmparker_> we appreciate it
[13:31:46] <ryanneufeld_> I'll bring it
[14:03:30] <toddmparker_> made a few small changes to the roster
[14:03:31] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/wiki/Roster
[14:03:43] <toddmparker_> and split out a Mobile Dev
[14:03:50] <toddmparker_> we'll all be floating around
[14:06:39] <toddmparker_> stepping out for a bit
[14:27:16] <agcolom> JasonDScott_: not sure if you are still around... I have joined the BlackBerry® Academic Program today (for the University).
[14:27:43] <JasonDScott_> agcolom: Awesome!
[14:28:17] <agcolom> They have really good material!
[14:28:21] <agcolom> (teaching)
[14:28:58] <agcolom> So I need to spend time and look at it in detail. The amount of resource is just HUGE!
[14:29:24] <JasonDScott_> agcolom: I am happy to hear that. :) I haven't had an opportunity to look at it.
[14:30:19] <agcolom> And it looks very well organised as well... ppt slides, some pdf docs and some lab exercises with sample code...
[14:30:20] <JasonDScott_> agcolom:  Are you integrating BlackBerry in your curriculum?
[14:31:10] <agcolom> Well I teach Mobile computing principles to 2nd year students and Mobile User Experience to 3rd year students
[14:31:21] <agcolom> (that's just the mobile-related modules)
[14:31:42] <agcolom> so for now it's all web-based (jQuery Mobile ;-) )
[14:32:00] <agcolom> but We have some devices (iPhone and iPads)
[14:32:16] <agcolom> so it's all targeting iPhone and iPads...
[14:32:44] <agcolom> But I would like to add more devices...
[14:33:10] <JasonDScott_> BB10?
[14:33:17] <agcolom> We have an iPhone development module (taught by the colleague who shares the office with me)
[14:33:38] <agcolom> and an Android module (Java)
[14:34:08] <agcolom> Yes, it would be nice to show other things and BB10 would be interesting
[14:34:32] <JasonDScott_> Sounds like you need a web based module with webworks and JQM BB10 theme :)
[14:34:36] <agcolom> I think with the programme I can get some devices if we qualify... I need to look at the details
[14:34:46] <agcolom> exactly!
[14:35:53] <agcolom> So I can show as well how to make web apps with "native" looks other than the usual iPhone/iPad
[14:36:14] <agcolom> Especially as Apple are not generous!
[14:36:30] <agcolom> While RIM really invests in education!
[14:36:57] <JasonDScott_> We try, education is the future
[14:37:13] <agcolom> I agree :)
[14:37:45] <JasonDScott_> I will PM you with the details of what I can do.
[14:38:16] <agcolom> Oh, great! Thanks :-)
