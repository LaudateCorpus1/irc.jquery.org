[04:05:44] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[04:06:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I had no idea either about which hotel, so thanks for the info :)
[04:06:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the conf is in Oregon Convention Centre, is the hotel there as well?
[04:08:05] <uGoMobi> maybe I missed an email, don't know who is my room mate either
[07:04:39] <scott_gonzalez_> toddmparker: ping
[07:16:20] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: Have not seen todd yet today hes been super busy lately is there maybe something i could help with?
[07:25:12] <toddmparker> heh, i think this is another reason why the scroll to hide url bar is a bad idea - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6081
[07:30:23] <scott_gonzalez_> toddmparker: ready?
[07:30:48] <scott_gonzalez_> Speaking of scrolling and location bars...
[07:30:58] <scott_gonzalez_> Does anyone know what would cause tap on top to not scroll up?
[07:31:12] <scott_gonzalez_> on iOS
[07:36:48] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: which version of ios?
[07:39:48] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: oh i remember it -webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch
[07:40:13] <arschmitz> messes with that its in our docs somewhere
[07:41:24] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: there is a note about it here  http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/docs/pages/touchoverflow.html
[07:42:22] <scott_gonzalez_> arschmitz: Thanks. When I'm off this call, I'll find the related ticket.
[07:42:44] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: cool no problem
[07:55:10] <scott_gonzalez_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/224
[08:01:11] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: ill check it out see if i see that in the css anywhere
[08:01:21] <scott_gonzalez_> Thanks arschmitz
[08:01:42] <arschmitz> this would be any of the new sites api org events ui etc... right?
[08:04:39] <scott_gonzalez_> yup
[08:04:51] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: it is there i found it 
[08:05:23] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: its part of the base.css
[08:05:43] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez_: i've seen that tap to top not work sometimes
[08:06:11] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/themes/jquery/css/base.css#L4292
[08:06:31] <scott_gonzalez_> So applying that to anything kills the scroll to top behavior?
[08:06:44] <arschmitz> sometimes its not 100% 
[08:06:58] <arschmitz> im charging my ipad up right now to see if removing fixes it
[08:07:37] <toddmparker> I know that using touch overflow killed the clock
[08:07:46] <toddmparker> and if folks use js scrollers
[08:07:55] <toddmparker> oh, yeah. there it is
[08:08:10] <toddmparker> scott and i did a bunch of testing when we first used that css property
[08:08:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yup its not a friendly css prop
[08:08:35] <arschmitz> im checking to make sure thats the problem with the wordpress sites right now
[08:08:57] <arschmitz> but apparently i killed my ipad watching game of thrones ast night ha ha so need to charge it for a few minutes
[08:09:08] <scott_gonzalez_> heh
[08:09:23] <toddmparker> tapping the clock scrolls the page to top
[08:09:49] <toddmparker> so if you use overflow or a custom scroller, tapping the clock won't do anything
[08:10:01] <toddmparker> it's really annoying. i use that all the time
[08:10:14] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah thats what i was just saying i just want to verify thats the problem here
[08:10:29] <arschmitz> but it looks like it 
[08:10:44] <toddmparker> and there is no event fired when the clock is tapped
[08:10:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker: its too bad its a great prop if it were not so buggy
[08:11:01] <toddmparker> if the page scrolls because you tapped it, you can see that event
[08:11:16] <toddmparker> but the point of using overflow containers is to not scroll the page so...
[08:11:27] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah
[08:11:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah but it would be nice if it was actually targeted just to the container the way you would think it would be
[08:12:10] <toddmparker> messing with scrolling w/mobile is very tricky bizness
[08:12:15] <arschmitz> yup
[08:12:30] <toddmparker> but how would they know what container to scroll?
[08:12:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker: clock tap i would think would always be page
[08:13:03] <toddmparker> be cool if there was some event fired when the clock was tapped that you could listen for to programmatically scroll the container
[08:13:05] <arschmitz> never effect any other container
[08:13:22] <toddmparker> well, it does, right?
[08:13:34] <toddmparker> tapping the clock scrolls the page
[08:13:51] <arschmitz> yes if webkit-overflow-scrolling isnt there
[08:14:08] <arschmitz> but regardless of that i would think it would always be page 
[08:14:12] <toddmparker> but if you're using a layout that is designed to fit onscreen w/ no scrolling needed and have scrolling on a container, tapping the clock won't scroll the page because no scrolling is needed
[08:14:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yes 
[08:14:38] <toddmparker> so it's sort of not a bug really
[08:14:58] <toddmparker> but it makes it impossible to carry that gesture over into scrolling containers
[08:15:05] <toddmparker> which is a bummer
[08:15:14] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:15:34] <toddmparker> you'd need to make the page scroll by 1px so a scroll would be registered
[08:15:41] <toddmparker> which would look janky
[08:16:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah in the case with the wordpress sites though its just about a container with in the page the page still scrolls
[08:16:58] <arschmitz> oh well though
[08:18:15] <toddmparker> hmm
[08:18:39] <toddmparker> i remember when testing this in iOS 5, if you have touch overflow in play and touched the clock, it would crash safari
[08:18:42] <toddmparker> fun.
[08:18:47] <toddmparker> hopefully, fixed in 6
[08:18:55] <arschmitz> hmm didnt crash my ios5 
[08:19:16] <toddmparker> don't think it was every time/situation
[08:19:23] <toddmparker> but in jQuery Mobile, it was wicked crashy
[08:19:43] <arschmitz> which is good at least maybe it was fixed in 5.1 or something too
[08:20:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: iv never really messed with it too much was just too buggy to be usefull
[08:26:02] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: was this noticed in ios5 or ios6 do you know?
[08:26:22] <scott_gonzalez_> iOS 5.
[08:26:28] <arschmitz> taping the clock to scroll is working fine on my ios6 ipad but not working on my ios5 iphone
[08:26:52] <arschmitz> ok so i guess they fixed with 6 thats good at least
[08:27:05] <scott_gonzalez_> Well that's good news.
[08:27:18] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: yup
[08:29:18] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: not sure it would be worth fixing since its over all an annoying but minor problem and ios adoption rates are crazy high 
[08:30:04] <scott_gonzalez_> arschmitz: Were you able to verify that it goes away if that rule is removed?
[08:30:22] <arschmitz> no because i cant use the safri dev tools in 6
[08:30:32] <arschmitz> and i dont have a local wordpress setup
[08:30:39] <arschmitz> i mean cant use them in 5
[08:31:00] <scott_gonzalez_> Ok, I'll setup a virtual host for testing locally.
[08:31:20] <arschmitz> i should probably setup wordpress at some point for stuff like this
[08:32:04] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: removing that rule will likely cause a bigger issue though
[08:32:15] <scott_gonzalez_> Sure, I just want to verify that's the problem.
[08:32:30] <arschmitz> whatever container thats for will just get cut off in ios if its removed and wont scroll
[08:34:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: as of yesterday ios5 was down to 5.5% world wide
[08:35:54] <scott_gonzalez_> ok, I'll just close it.
[08:36:30] <scott_gonzalez_> Thanks for all the info and investigation arschmitz.
[08:36:43] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: oh and apparently ios7 is being unveild in a week
[08:36:52] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: no problem at all
[08:36:54] <scott_gonzalez_> Oh yeah?
[08:36:58] <scott_gonzalez_> Is the new iPhone coming out?
[08:37:02] <scott_gonzalez_> I've been waiting to get a new phone.
[08:37:11] <arschmitz> not sure me too i still have an iphone4
[08:38:17] <arschmitz> ios 7 is being unvailed at wwdc nothign about any hardware but its apple so who knows
[08:38:23] <arschmitz> normally they come together
[08:38:50] <arschmitz> hmm osx10.9 is going to be unveiled also
[08:40:07] <scott_gonzalez_> Yeah, I have an iPhone 4 and my wife has a 4S.
[08:40:15] <scott_gonzalez_> We're switching from AT&T to Verizon.
[08:40:28] <scott_gonzalez_> So we're waiting for the new phone to come out before we switch.
[08:40:40] <arschmitz> yeah my wife and i both have 4's but i think we are going to continue with att at least for now
[08:40:45] <arschmitz> yeah i dont blame you
[08:41:04] <scott_gonzalez_> Well, we're going to join my parent's family plan, which will cut our monthly bill in half.
[08:41:10] <scott_gonzalez_> And then we'll have tethering as well.
[08:41:12] <arschmitz> i heard a rumor about iphone5s soon then iphone 6 late fall but who ever knows with that stuff
[08:41:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: thats why i have att we switch to join her parents family plan to lower cost
[08:49:32] <Forte_> Jasper: I have the grunticon'd icons and a directory set up. How should I get them to you?
[09:04:17] <scott_gonzalez_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/224#issuecomment-19114989
[09:05:54] <toddmparker> new iPhone will probably be sept
[09:06:00] <toddmparker> worth waiting
[09:09:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: hmm let me check those ones i was on api sites
[09:12:28] <toddmparker> working on getting those new icons in. running grunt icon now
[09:12:31] <toddmparker> $ gz icons.data.svg.css 
[09:12:32] <toddmparker> orig: 63590 bytes
[09:12:33] <toddmparker> gzip: 6202 bytes (9.75%)
[09:12:46] <toddmparker> 6k for 50 vector icons, not too shabby
[09:12:59] <arschmitz> nice
[09:13:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker: you have an iphone5 right?
[09:13:10] <toddmparker> the png fallback w/data uri is ~7k gipped
[09:13:16] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yep
[09:13:33] <arschmitz> can you go to blog.jquery.com scroll down and tap the clock and see if it works?
[09:13:55] <arschmitz> i dont have an ios6 phone here and on my ios6 ipad it works fine to scroll to top
[09:14:07] <toddmparker> sure
[09:14:14] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thanks
[09:14:37] <toddmparker> no dice
[09:14:51] <arschmitz> hmm so its an iphone vs ipad thing i guess
[09:15:03] <arschmitz> not an ios version issue
[09:15:12] <arschmitz> thats dissapointing
[09:16:05] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: i should be able to grab ios6 phone when i go home for lunch and ill do some debugging on that prop with that
[09:16:14] <scott_gonzalez_> Thanks
[09:16:40] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: no problem sadd it wasent really fixed on ios6 and weird it works on ipad 
[09:16:51] <scott_gonzalez_> Yeah, that's odd.
[09:17:05] <arschmitz> very there is so little difference between the two
[09:17:19] <arschmitz> my best guess is the implementation is different because of the tabs on ipad
[09:53:54] <agcolom> arschmitz: scott_gonzalez_ I checked on my iPhone 4S with iOS6 and I also get the issue. I'm not on the latest iOS6, just on 6.1.2 
[10:10:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I asked of events@jquery.org where we would stay, and Richard answered saying that it was the DoubleTree in Portland, and that we'd have individual rooms this time.
[10:15:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You killed your iPad watching Game of Thrones? That's enough killing already!
[11:26:24] <arschmitz> johnbender: you around?

[13:14:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok thanks for the info
[13:17:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP!
[13:17:50] <uGoMobi> Forte_: great!
[13:18:14] <Forte_> NP
[13:18:27] <uGoMobi> Forte_: where should this directory go?
[13:18:55] <uGoMobi> can we add a folder in the repo
[13:19:04] <uGoMobi> in a branch
[13:19:08] <uGoMobi> ?
[13:19:14] <Forte_> Yeah, however you'd like to set it up
[13:19:18] <uGoMobi> okay
[13:19:33] <uGoMobi> I'll create a new branch
[13:19:33] <Forte_> Probably just link the icons in first and then get things set up with grunt.js
[13:20:03] <uGoMobi> anyone at Filament with commit access that can add the directory?
[13:21:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when I create a branch from "next" do I need to set any flags
[13:21:18] <uGoMobi> or just git checkout -b ?
[13:21:31] <uGoMobi> while I am on "next"
[13:25:31] <uGoMobi> seems to be ok

[13:41:29] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[13:41:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think it went ok, thanks
[13:41:44] <uGoMobi> much better than yesterday
[13:41:59] <uGoMobi> different audience
[13:42:03] <arschmitz> awesome
[13:42:35] <uGoMobi> got 3 questions at the end and to all 3 I could answer... that will be in 14 :)
[13:42:44] <arschmitz> lol
[13:42:55] <arschmitz> i had a bunch of that in korea
[13:43:02] <arschmitz> execpt it was 1.3
[13:43:13] <uGoMobi> one person was asking about deeplinking so I pointed him at your h2widget
[13:43:45] <uGoMobi> hope we can make linking to ID possible in 1.5
[13:43:56] <arschmitz> oh yeah i still need to get that fixed
[13:44:10] <uGoMobi> is it broken?
[13:44:27] <arschmitz> no it was just suposed to get merged into nav for 1.4
[13:44:38] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[13:44:55] <arschmitz> not h2 it self
[13:44:59] <arschmitz> but the deeplinking
[13:45:04] <uGoMobi> let's open a ticket for it
[13:45:06] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[13:45:18] <uGoMobi> probably already a feature request ticket out there
[13:45:24] <arschmitz> pretty sure
[13:45:42] <arschmitz> right after 1.3 was a crazy time for me not suprised i forgot
[13:46:21] <uGoMobi> yeah don't blame you :)
[13:46:34] <_|Nix|_> I think we can get it in for 1.4, especially since it's done. Although, we'd have to check how that fits in with johnbender's work.
[13:46:50] <arschmitz> its not too complicated to do though so yeah 1.4 should be fine
[13:47:03] <arschmitz> and yeah this is more about the work he did for 1.3

[13:47:20] <arschmitz> but still need to talk to him to double check because some stuff has moved into different object files now
[13:47:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess jumping to an anchor would have to be relative to the container, ... or not? Can a content widget contain a jump to a place in the document that is in a different content widget?
[13:48:03] <arschmitz> now i dont think it would
[13:48:11] <arschmitz> its just setting a scroll position for the document]
[13:48:24] <arschmitz> so what container its in should not matter 
[13:48:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, but what if the container needs to be scrolled, not the document?
[13:49:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I think we were gonna do scrolling regions later - after 1.4.
[13:49:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, for now, I think that's fair.
[13:49:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes 
[13:49:24] <arschmitz> thats 1.5 or 1.6
[13:49:28] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[13:49:34] <arschmitz> and still not looking good on that being doable
[13:49:53] <arschmitz> been looking at some issues with -webkit-overflow-scroll:touch today
[13:50:14] <arschmitz> it causes some problems that are not fixable in ios
[13:50:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I saw that convo.
[13:50:23] <arschmitz> yeah 
[13:50:26] <arschmitz> its ugly
[13:50:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I didn't even know you could scroll to the top with the ... clock icon? Is that the one in the top status bar?
[13:50:47] <arschmitz> but maybe it will be fixed in ios7
[13:50:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wish I had known that during all my jsperf runs.
[13:51:16] <arschmitz> not clock icon just the top bar really where signal and battery and time are

[13:58:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah the deeplinking should be fine. If you want to work on it we should just merge the content-widget branch
[13:58:13] <johnbender> arschmitz: many and varied
[13:58:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: honestly I don't know
[13:58:28] <arschmitz> i dont actually want to do this its a potential workaround for someone
[13:58:35] <johnbender> it's impossible to keep all that shit in my head for more than the span of a given ticket
[13:58:42] <arschmitz> lol
[13:59:04] <johnbender> arschmitz: I would avoid monkeying with that, I think we already prevent default for chrome (initial popstate)
[13:59:14] <johnbender> arschmitz: but you can try it and tell them the caveats
[13:59:21] <arschmitz> johnbender: chrome inital is the problem actually
[13:59:24] <johnbender> that popstate is so fucking finicky between browsers they are on their own
[13:59:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ^
[13:59:30] <arschmitz> lol
[13:59:34] <johnbender> I thoht we addressed that
[14:00:03] <arschmitz> johnbender: basicly someone wants to navigate to a dialog on the first page load
[14:00:16] <arschmitz> and the options are setimeout on pagechange event
[14:00:29] <arschmitz> or prevent navigate once on pagechange
[14:00:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: what about the pagebefore load "redirect"
[14:00:39] <johnbender> err pagebeforechange
[14:00:42] <arschmitz> they want the first page to actually load first
[14:00:54] <arschmitz> so if they click back it goes back to that page
[14:01:05] <arschmitz> or if they click the close x
[14:01:36] <_|Nix|_> I guess that's a good point. I provided that workaround without actually testing it extensively.
[14:01:43] <_|Nix|_> It happened to work on Chrome 27/desktop.
[14:01:53] <arschmitz> and the navigate event is actually coming after the pagechange event
[14:02:22] <arschmitz> but yeah seemed like it could cause issues
[14:03:04] <arschmitz> hmmmm
[14:03:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe have them bind to navigate?
[14:03:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: BOOM!
[14:03:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, and open the popup from there ... not bad.
[14:03:51] <arschmitz> yup it works
[14:04:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IINM that navigate now arrives on all platforms. It's artificially generated on non-WK ones.
[14:04:08] <arschmitz> dont even need to let the stack unwind
[14:04:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nope. Not bad.
[14:04:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wonder if you even need to turn off popup history ...
[14:04:35] <arschmitz> shouldnt
[14:04:47] <_|Nix|_> Now I have /got/ to see this in action.
[14:04:53] * _|Nix|_ heads over to jsbin :)
[14:04:54] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ayumal/30/edit
[14:04:59] <arschmitz> already did it lol
[14:05:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ^^
[14:05:30] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... popup doesn't open ...
[14:05:34] <_|Nix|_> On FF.
[14:05:48] <arschmitz> damn didnt try firefox yet
[14:06:11] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... I guess we're not synthesizing navigate on platforms that don't have an initial popstate.
[14:06:20] <_|Nix|_> I remembered wrong.
[14:06:38] <_|Nix|_> Good thing too ... why inflict WK's brain damage on a perfectly sane platform?
[14:06:59] <arschmitz> hmm i could still work with this i think
[14:07:46] <_|Nix|_> K ... wait ... now it's weird. It does show up.
[14:08:14] <_|Nix|_> You changed it to on-pagechange + setTimeout.
[14:08:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im editing it lol
[14:08:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: pagechange plus setTimeout 0 works on firefox
[14:08:39] <_|Nix|_> I see that.
[14:08:50] <arschmitz> so need to do something like check webkit if webkit bind to navigate else pagechange
[14:09:02] <arschmitz> a little complex but will do the trick
[14:09:03] <_|Nix|_> Not on Chrome though! Nah nahnah nah nah!
[14:09:16] <arschmitz> huh?
[14:09:31] <arschmitz> it works on chrome with navigate
[14:09:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, but not with pagechange + setTimeout.
[14:09:46] <arschmitz> right
[14:10:01] <arschmitz> thats why i said check if webkit
[14:10:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's what the nah-nah-ing was about. Can't use the same solution everywhere.
[14:10:07] <arschmitz> oh yeah

[14:10:16] <arschmitz> not ideal but i think its the best option

[14:10:36] <arschmitz> got ya
[14:11:01] <arschmitz> well gota run home cars in the shop and ride is getting anxious lol
[14:11:09] <_|Nix|_> Did I mention that WK is creeping its way up to IE-levels of dispicability?
[14:11:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright. L8R!
[14:11:36] <arschmitz> webkit has more workarounds in jquery then ie
[14:11:52] <arschmitz> davemethvin mentioned it a while back
