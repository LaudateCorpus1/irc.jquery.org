[03:38:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping
[03:38:20] <_|Nix|_> !
[03:38:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong!
[03:38:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Is there a demo under docs/demos that has html as well as JS and CSS?
[03:39:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or, at least, more than just HTML?
[03:39:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, one sec...
[03:40:53] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Old build #81: FAILURE in 1 hr 19 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/81/
[03:41:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: last one on this page http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/collapsibles/index.html
[03:42:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no demo yet that uses JS as well
[03:42:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is also a template in the demo-template folder, if you want to see how to include CSS/JS
[03:43:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: yeah, found it in the meantime. Thanks!
[03:43:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: note that you can't target a specific script or style in the <head> yet
[03:43:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's something I still have to look into
[03:44:48] <uGoMobi> could make that work for style by adding a class to the <style> tag, but that didn't work for scripts
[03:45:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP. I was just demoing it to a colleague who's also trying to make demos targeted at developers.
[03:46:10] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[03:46:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The popup/collapsibleSet/source viewer combo is awesome!
[03:46:28] <uGoMobi> thanks
[03:48:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I also noticed that it's a bit slow when you have many examples on a page... probably better to call the syntax highlighter function when you click on a "view source" button instead of creating all source views on pageinit
[03:50:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not a bad idea ...
[03:50:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: popupbeforeshow ;)
[03:51:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah :)
[04:07:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Demos look good on Chrome/HTC One X
[04:07:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool!
[04:45:32] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[04:45:46] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz
[04:46:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5291
[04:46:48] <uGoMobi> and I just noticed this feature doesn't work on Android native browser (tested 4.1)
[04:46:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool
[04:47:02] <uGoMobi> that has not to do with your changes
[04:47:13] <uGoMobi> didn't work with old code either
[04:47:40] <arschmitz> you mean using the next and previous buttons dosent work on android 4.1?
[04:47:45] <uGoMobi> on Chrome for Android it does work
[04:48:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, I meant the hideDuringFocus feature
[04:48:22] <uGoMobi> Android doesn't have next/prev
[04:48:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh ok.
[04:49:20] <uGoMobi> the toolbars just don't hide when focus is on input
[04:49:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm have to look into that. i wonder if android dosent support focusin or something?
[04:51:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: my assistant will be here in like 10 minutes and he has an android with 4.1 ill check it out. Want to file an issue for that?
[04:52:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: Android is supposed to support those events
[04:52:41] <uGoMobi> yeah, I will open a ticket
[04:53:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i assumed it should just not sure why that wouldnt work lol its not very complicated code.
[04:53:25] <uGoMobi> there is another issue... when you click on a label of a text input the input itself gets focus
[04:54:40] <uGoMobi> makes it pretty hard to blur on a page like this http://jsbin.com/omegup/30
[04:56:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi created fix-4724 (+4 new commits): http://git.io/la8GBQ
[04:56:20] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/fix-4724 8d1a563 Alexander Schmitz: FixedToolbars: Wait for stack to unwind before showing tollbars on focusout to make sure we have not jumped to another input. Fixed #4724 - Moving through form in Mobile Safari with "Next" and "Previous" system controls causes fixed position, tap-toggle false Header to reveal itself
[04:56:20] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/fix-4724 5dd7f6d Alexander Schmitz: FixedToolbar: Update unit tests to reflect that we must wait for the stack to unwind on toggle method before checking for classes
[04:56:20] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/fix-4724 4be40d8 Jasper de Groot: Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile into fix-4724
[04:56:39] <arschmitz> hmm yeah not really sure how to work around that one though
[04:56:57] <arschmitz> because not hiding the tollbars on keyboard pop introduces all sorts of other issues
[04:57:21] <uGoMobi> but that is the idea behind the function
[04:57:59] <uGoMobi> if it is causing all kind of issues we should consider to deprecate it
[04:58:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oops... I missed the "not" in your line
[04:58:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so you think we should keep the toolbars open all the time?
[04:59:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: or visible rather
[04:59:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, I think this is a good feature
[04:59:36] <arschmitz> oh ok
[04:59:52] <uGoMobi> so we should look into making it work on all supported platforms
[05:00:25] <uGoMobi> have no idea yet why it doesn't work on Android 4.1 native browser and didn't test other Android versions yet
[05:00:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i agree i was going to lookinto it on 4.1 once my assistant gets here with his 4.1 phone.
[05:01:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: as far as your test page where its hard to blur though. do you have a suggestion for this because im not sure i see much in the way of workarounds on that?
[05:01:09] <uGoMobi> I just misread... thought you said that hiding the toolbars on focus was causing all kind of issues
[05:01:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh ok no not hiding them causes far far worse problems lol
[05:02:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I dunno why the input get focus when you click on a label, so can't tell yet if it is difficult to fix
[05:03:17] <arschmitz> oh thats part of html spec
[05:03:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: all browsers even desktop do that
[05:04:05] <uGoMobi> really? didn't know that
[05:04:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats the function of the label and why you dont just put the text there
[05:05:11] <uGoMobi> I see, thought that was about semantically associate the label with the input
[05:05:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah it does that too for like screen readers
[05:06:34] <uGoMobi> then let's not change this
[05:07:00] <uGoMobi> there is probably more space between inputs if you use a field container
[05:07:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: probably and i agree best not to mess with something like this
[05:07:56] <uGoMobi> yup
[05:08:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BTW - I just pulled your commits in a branch fix-4724, not in master
[05:08:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you made the changes in master of your forked repo, not in a branch
[05:08:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh i must not have been paying attention i normally do branches for everything
[05:09:09] <uGoMobi> yeah I know
[05:11:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you see my comments on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5267 ?
[05:11:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[05:12:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this bug is indeed caused by the way Samsung keeps that address bar visible
[05:13:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not sure there is going to be a good workaround on this one since its not all android only samsung tablets.
[05:13:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I can think of an ugly one
[05:14:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and even at that im not sure wether we will be able to detect the keyboard or not
[05:14:27] <arschmitz> ugh too early addressbar not keyboard lol
[05:14:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: whats that?
[05:15:11] <uGoMobi> browser sniffing + on scroll set top: *px; where * is the height of the addressbar
[05:15:24] <uGoMobi> but that's a really ugly one
[05:15:58] <uGoMobi> and you have to be sure the issue is on all the galaxy tabs
[05:16:14] <arschmitz> its not on old original ones
[05:16:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the one on browserstack has a completely different browsers thats not "tabbed" and dosent do this.
[05:17:02] <uGoMobi> then it's probably difficult to target only the ones who have the issue
[05:17:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is that also a Samsung or vanilla android?
[05:17:34] <_|Nix|_> You guys aren't making another change to fixedToolbar which'll render https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4795 un-applyable again, are you?
[05:17:43] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ...
[05:18:03] <uGoMobi> :)
[05:18:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: apply yours first and then we can fix mine mine is much easier
[05:18:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can you please go over https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4795 as well? arschmitz aleady gave it a nod, and I'd /really, really/ like to merge it.
[05:18:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, please!
[05:18:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Should be pretty straight forward.
[05:19:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[05:19:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[05:19:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: only reason I didn't want to give up on that Galaxy Tab fixed toolbar issue is that it has a pretty fair marketshare
[05:19:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its a samsung galexy tab just first gen running 2.2
[05:19:53] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:20:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just learned that the S3 has surpassed the iPhone 4S as the most sold smartphone ever.
[05:20:10] * _|Nix|_ 's jaw is on the floor.
[05:20:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i agree and its a pretty substantial issue.
[05:20:30] <_|Nix|_> It's the Android-calypse ...
[05:20:32] <uGoMobi> yeah that one is pretty popular
[05:20:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: wow thats suprises me
[05:20:50] <uGoMobi> and in couple of months the S4 will be out
[05:21:00] <_|Nix|_> GoogleFire™ and GoogleBrimStone™
[05:21:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i learner from a guy at samsung while i was in korea that they are transitioning away from android next year
[05:21:24] <arschmitz> *learned
[05:22:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they are going to use their new webOS Tizen.
[05:23:04] <uGoMobi> I am curious about Tizen
[05:24:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: firefoxOS is almost ready too
[05:25:18] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:25:33] <uGoMobi> and BB10 on it's way
[05:25:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's funny since us at Intel are Samsung's partners in their Tizen efforts.
[05:25:43] <arschmitz> :( as if things werent complicated enough already
[05:26:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i didnt know that
[05:27:23] <uGoMobi> and I think WP will become a more serious player too with the Nokia Lumia/WP8 devices
[05:27:42] <uGoMobi> competition is good
[05:27:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: +1 to that.
[05:27:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not to mention all the windows 8 tabelts
[05:27:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean to "competition is good".
[05:28:40] <uGoMobi> if we only had to deal with one platform without bugs we would be out of jobs soon ;)
[05:28:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: i agree as well just makes our jobs of supporting everything that much harder thats all
[05:29:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good point ha ha
[05:30:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Microsoft has been blaming intel for why the intel based surface tablets are not ready yet
[05:33:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *shrug*
[06:02:56] <RWhitbeck> arschmitz your Samsung source was that the "API" guy?
[06:03:49] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: yeah he talked about it in between API's HA HA
[06:04:23] <RWhitbeck> arschmitz I guess I was to engrossed in the API drinking game to notice anything else he said.
[06:05:12] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: i had shut my skype down in anticipation of going on stage so i wasent playing
[06:06:29] <RWhitbeck> arschmitz good thing you would have been plastered, LOL
[06:07:53] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: right would have fallen off the side of the stage babbleing about mobile
[06:08:06] <_|Nix|_> :)
[06:08:42] <RWhitbeck> arschmitz then I would have blamed you for copying my talk ;-)
[06:09:05] <_|Nix|_> LOL :(
[06:09:07] <_|Nix|_> Oops :)
[06:09:09] <_|Nix|_> :)
[06:09:22] <_|Nix|_> ... and I didn't even drink :)
[06:09:41] <RWhitbeck> _|Nix|_ sure sure
[06:10:51] <arschmitz> RWhitebeck: you killed me with that one
[06:12:13] <RWhitbeck> -100 demerit points for misspelling my name arschmitz
[06:12:34] <arschmitz> :( damn it ALL MY POINTS GONE!
[06:23:34] <toddmparker> morning
[06:23:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: Morning
[06:27:29] <_|Nix|_> Huomenta!
[06:27:48] <RWhitbeck> morning toddmparker
[06:31:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5303
[06:32:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: turns out it's not just hideDuringFocus, but also with tapToggle
[06:32:19] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker
[06:33:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thank you ill check it out. Looks like our hide funtion dosent work on android 4.1.
[06:33:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think it might have to do with focus event firing multiple times
[06:33:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Did you have a chance to look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4795?
[06:34:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looking at it right now
[06:34:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome! Thanks!
[06:35:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but it taptoggle dosent work either that shouldnt set focus if your just clicking empty page
[06:35:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good point
[06:36:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: my thought was based on the issue with the custom select that I mention in the ticket
[06:36:39] <uGoMobi> maybe not related
[06:36:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: which means its either the transition or the .ui-fixed-hidden class
[06:37:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there isnt an issue mentioned in the ticket you sent me?
[06:39:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5303 "When you open the custom select on the test page you'll see that sometimes the second item in the list gets focus, sometimes the third, while it should be the first."
[06:39:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: or do you mean you don't see any text in that ticket at all?
[06:39:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Dang ... not good ... I remember looking at that ...
[06:40:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh sorry i thought you meant you refrenced another issue in that one just missunderstood.
[06:44:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the custom select acts a bit weird on Android native browser (4.1)... you first see a blinking blue box (focus indicator) at the position where the custom select will be rendered and then the custom select is shown
[06:47:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.jshttps://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/L532
[06:47:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Feel like incrementing that timeout from 0 to > 0 and seeing what happens?
[06:48:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is a bug in your custom replace function ;)
[06:48:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I bet johnbender just felt a disturbance in the Force.
[06:48:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Dang!
[06:48:30] <_|Nix|_> You're right!
[06:48:31] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:48:41] <uGoMobi> the hash is goe
[06:48:45] <uGoMobi> gone even
[06:48:46] <_|Nix|_> I see it.
[06:49:03] <_|Nix|_> Of course! It should be [0-9]+ not [0-9*]
[06:49:12] <_|Nix|_> I mean ... not [0-9]*
[06:49:57] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L532
[06:50:02] <_|Nix|_> ... better ...
[06:50:11] <uGoMobi> yeah :)
[06:50:26] <uGoMobi> Awesome! ;)
[06:50:37] <_|Nix|_> :)

[06:54:55] <toddmparker> just caching up in here
[06:56:20] <toddmparker> nice job tracking down that latest fix so fast.
[06:56:37] <toddmparker> great to have a critical mass of people hammering away in here
[06:57:01] <toddmparker> if I don't say it enough, I'm honored to work with such an awesome team. you all rock.
[06:57:12] <toddmparker> i have a call in 5, then will be back on
[06:57:26] <toddmparker> i need to get caught up on this samsung fixed toolbar issue
[06:57:34] <toddmparker> arschmitz: what device and version?
[06:58:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker galexy tab 4.0.4
[06:58:13] <toddmparker> and should i close as won't fix? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3912
[06:58:39] <arschmitz> toddmparker: you already did !
[06:58:40] <toddmparker> arschmitz: i don't think i have a device like that
[06:58:50] <toddmparker> i have 2 nexus 7's running 4.0 and 4.1
[06:59:03] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5267
[06:59:10] <toddmparker> but not a samsung, those are asus
[06:59:16] <uGoMobi> that's the galaxy tab issue
[06:59:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah that one i would like to fix but its going to be tough with out having a test device and its also very device specific
[07:00:11] <toddmparker> i feel like if a certain oem or device is acting odd within a platform like android or wp, that's outside of what we usually fix
[07:00:18] <toddmparker> esp. if hacky
[07:00:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker: going to be super hacky like trying to compensate for the addressbar in update page padding for that specific device
[07:03:04] <uGoMobi> have to agree that if it is possible to fix this, it's going to be an ugly workaround with risk that it will also be applied on devices that don't need it
[07:03:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: we also dont know if other galexy tabs running different versions are effected or how specific broad the issue is
[07:04:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toddmparker: my vote is to close with a note about other people running into it. if we start seeing more issues and can narrow it down better then maybe considder a fix in the future?
[07:04:23] <uGoMobi> only thing that made me doubt was that the Galaxy Tab is a pretty popular device
[07:07:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: +1
[07:08:13] <uGoMobi> we can also mention it at the known problems so people can decide to add the Galaxy Tab to the blacklist
[07:08:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4795/files is causing a problem
[07:09:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good idea
[07:09:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you mean it's causing a problem?
[07:09:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am testing persistent toolbars and get page loading errors
[07:10:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but not all the time
[07:10:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lemme see if I can narrow it down
[07:10:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Can you please put the steps-to-repro into the PR?
[07:11:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm going AFK for a bit, but I'll be back in the evening.
[07:11:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it could be just an issue with the branch preview
[07:11:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: later
[07:11:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks, and L8R!
[07:22:38] <uGoMobi> ?tell _|Nix|_ Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4795 That persistent toolbar issue had not to do with your changes, but with branch preview. Suggested changes look good to me!
[07:22:39] <bot-t> uGoMobi, Okay.
[07:35:33] <uGoMobi> ?tell _|Nix|_ had to set the timeout to 400 (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L540) to actually prevent the flash issue on Android
[07:35:33] <bot-t> uGoMobi, Okay.
[07:51:40] <kIDdinjo> so i developed android app with phonegap and jquery, my menu bar (navbar) is lagging a bit when i am going through html pages, is there a chance to speed up that a bit, or i need to  create js script which calls that or what...
[08:14:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what did you test 5303 on? i cant reproduce on a nexus 7 on browserstack with 4.1 waiting for my assistant still to check on his galaxy nexus with 4.1.
[08:24:21] <toddmparker> kIDdinjo: This is the channel for the dev team. Can you please post that on #jquerymobile or the forums?
[08:31:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: Galaxy Nexus / Android 4.1.1
[08:32:10] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: do we need to add demos and update the docs for the dialog close button stuff?
[08:32:18] <toddmparker> sure i could help with that if needed
[08:32:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: perfect thats what my assistant has when he gets back from taking some photos
[08:35:05] <toddmparker> i need an assistant arschmitz
[08:36:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ha ha you have a whole company of them  :) mine dosent know js or css or even html but he is good for taking photos doing basic updates stuff like that
[08:36:29] <arschmitz> keeps me free to work on stuff like this
[08:37:15] <toddmparker> that's great
[08:37:59] <arschmitz> yup :) its my younger brother too so i dont even need to be nice HA HA HA
[08:39:33] <toddmparker> lots of throwing coffee at him, i get it
[08:43:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I looked at the TR, to remove those corner classes, but I am not really sure
[08:44:40] <uGoMobi> sure about how everything works I mean
[08:45:05] <uGoMobi> and I don't know how I can test the changes local
[08:53:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i think you just need to have php running
[08:53:24] <toddmparker> i remember running it locally. did you just open in localhost?
[08:53:28] <uGoMobi> I have php running on my local server
[08:53:36] <toddmparker> no dice?
[08:53:54] <uGoMobi> no, not yet
[08:54:08] <toddmparker> cloning it down now
[08:56:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ah, I think I got it
[08:57:03] <toddmparker> ok. seems to open ok for me
[08:57:28] <uGoMobi> yes, sorry, was local problem
[08:57:32] <toddmparker> i saw that we have active states per swatch penciled in for 1.3 too
[08:57:42] <uGoMobi> oh, that was 1.4
[08:57:46] <toddmparker> think we should hack on that at some point?
[08:58:13] <uGoMobi> it is not much work for the framework itself
[08:58:47] <toddmparker> you're right. 1.4
[08:58:48] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3750
[08:58:49] <uGoMobi> now I see the TR local I might get a better view on how things work
[08:59:04] <toddmparker> which is probably good because i want to re-think the css first and just roll this in
[08:59:10] <uGoMobi> because I think most work will be to get that in the TR
[08:59:26] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yeah, you and i should probably just get good at TR stuff
[08:59:41] <toddmparker> tyler is around to help and answer Q's
[09:00:15] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: guess this issue was the one that confused me. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5009
[09:00:49] <uGoMobi> ah I see, that's still for 1.3
[09:02:21] <uGoMobi> that issue is more related to navigation
[09:31:42] <johnbender> toddmparker: hey, still working on some internal stuff but I'm hoping to have the popup tests passing before the end of the week
[09:31:43] <bot-t> (52 hours 50 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender The question was this: Should we systematically implement _destroy() for all our widgets, whether we get bug reports about their being absent or not?
[09:32:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes we should, but lets do it for a release since it could cause odd behavior
[09:33:50] <arschmitz> johnbender: _|Nix|_ and i have been talking about that and we were thinking we should open a ticket to review all the widgets to make sure they are following the widget factory standards having _destroy using _on proper refresh methods etc
[09:34:16] <arschmitz> johnbender: and tag it as a dev task for 1.4
[09:34:16] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: that sounds dandy to me
[09:34:25] <johnbender> really good idea
[09:34:50] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: if you want to get really fancy it would be nice to look into memory profile testing
[09:35:05] <johnbender> like profiling the navigation tests in an automated way to detect leaks
[09:35:12] <arschmitz> johnbender: cool right now some of them need a lot of work to bring them inline with what they should be
[09:35:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool
[09:35:27] <arschmitz> johnbender: thats a good idea too
[09:35:55] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: I would confine the work to destroy methods though
[09:36:08] <johnbender> the "after enhance" behavior is an area for discussion
[09:36:23] <johnbender> and it probably dovetails tightly with pre-rendered markup from the server
[09:37:28] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:43:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok think i found the issue on 5303
[09:44:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what was 5303?
[09:44:41] <arschmitz> taptoggle in 4.1.1
[09:44:45] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:44:46] <arschmitz> or hide in general
[09:44:55] <arschmitz> its jsbin double firing the events
[09:45:07] <arschmitz> i cant replicate in docs at all but in your jsbins it happens
[09:45:11] <uGoMobi> aha, JS Bin again
[09:45:33] <arschmitz> testing with same exact device as you native browser galaxy nexus on 4.1.1
[09:46:00] <uGoMobi> ok, thanks for testing
[09:46:16] <arschmitz> in docs everything works perfectly so i think we can probably close that one out.
[09:46:50] <uGoMobi> I just closed it
[09:47:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool that was an easier fix then i thought :)
[09:47:52] <uGoMobi> :)
[09:50:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: want to comment on and close 5267 also while your at it? thats the samsung galaxy tab one 
[09:53:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: working on RWD/demos/docs stuff this week... will close it with a commit that adds the info to the known issues in the docs
[09:53:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds good thank you
[10:57:29] <ryanneufeld> Just tried out the new popup for the first time... hawt
[10:58:32] <jlembeck> Hey johnbender: I've been working on bring the tables branch up to speed, and I'm at a point to perform a PR with the upstream tables branch. Only, it feels almost reckless
[10:58:35] <jlembeck> here is why
[10:58:56] <jlembeck> (frickin skitch, one second)
[10:59:25] <jlembeck> https://www.evernote.com/shard/s41/sh/c90c7ac1-cdfd-460b-9131-79919f74ad6c/9e3a266ee88fdbf203853585a2f8d942
[11:00:01] <jlembeck> One of the reasons there are so many differences, is that I've merged mine with master
[11:12:48] <toddmparker> arschmitz (et all) - going forward, we're going to tell people to just go the the #jquery irc channel for support
[11:12:57] <toddmparker> that's what ui does apparently
[11:25:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker: some of the other people mentioned that in korea when we were talking because jquerymobile is always so quiet
[11:26:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker: probably get help a lot wuicker there
[11:50:13] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: you here?
[12:08:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I am here now.
[12:08:27] <bot-t> (4 hours 45 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell _|Nix|_ Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4795 That persistent toolbar issue had not to do with your changes, but with branch preview. Suggested changes look good to me!
[12:08:28] <bot-t> (4 hours 32 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell _|Nix|_ had to set the timeout to 400 (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L540) to actually prevent the flash issue on Android
[12:08:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wow! That's terrible!
[12:09:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Did you push that timeout change?
[12:09:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, didn't have the guts ;-)

[12:10:48] <_|Nix|_> Werh! Perty kherlers!
[12:12:20] <gnarf> oh hey - colors worked!
[12:12:30] <gnarf> now if i can just get issues / pulls to be notifying here
[12:12:39] <gnarf> ajpiano: ^^^ damn +c ;)
[12:13:01] <uGoMobi> gnarf: cool!
[12:13:25] <uGoMobi> at first I thought I just had been staring at my screen too long
[12:15:13] <gnarf> uGoMobi: :)
[12:15:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if that 400ms timeout is only needed for Android 4.0+, shouldn't we do browser sniffing here?
[12:17:37] <uGoMobi> only tested one test case on one Android device/version, so we might want to do some more testing first
[12:19:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can't reproduce the issue with the custom select docs page on localhost.
[12:19:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what Android version?
[12:19:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does it happen with all popups, or just custom select.
[12:19:49] <_|Nix|_> ?
[12:19:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 4.1.2 emulated.
[12:20:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: only tested the custom select
[12:20:47] <uGoMobi> need to do more testing before changing anything
[12:25:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Wasent that the issue you thought was related to the double focus that was just jsbin
[12:26:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: That might be why you can't reproduce 
[12:26:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yup, so I have to test this outside JS Bin
[12:28:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, right ... 
[12:28:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Be nice to be sure.
[12:30:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: on http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/selects/custom.html I see the flash as well but not as bad as that JS Bin test page
[12:31:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[12:31:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I copied the jsbin's content to a .html file on localhost ... lemme see ...
[12:31:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: also, it's not consistent
[12:33:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pressing the up/down arrow keys on the emulator results in a permanent blue flash.
[12:33:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, the container is getting the focus.
[12:34:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and sometimes when the custom select opens, the third item has the highlight.
[12:34:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just opened one of the examples on that page and saw the focus shifting from the 1st, 2nd to the 3rd list item
[12:34:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly
[12:34:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, weird, eh?
[12:34:41] <uGoMobi> it is
[12:34:51] <arschmitz> ASchmitz@billdodgetycodog7
[12:34:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Time for some console.log messages.
[12:35:14] <arschmitz> erg i hate it when i do that stupid macros
[12:39:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The item under the mouse is highlighted.
[12:39:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think the mouseclick makes it through to the listview.
[12:40:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you click on the portion of the button that will not be covered by the popup, no item gets highlighted. If you click on a portion of the button that will be covered by the popup, the item that ends up covering the button becomes highlighted.
[12:40:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lemme try that
[12:41:07] <toddmparker> can we drop support for android now?
[12:41:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there are at least 2 other click through issues open on android ugh!
[12:43:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker: this is 4.1 not even 2.x
[12:44:28] <toddmparker> arg
[12:45:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when I tap at the edge of the select button I still get focus issues
[12:45:51] <uGoMobi> no focus on a list item at all, focus on 3rd item, flash before showing selectmenu
[12:46:07] <uGoMobi> but not all the time
[12:46:19] <uGoMobi> kinda random
[12:48:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have managed to fix the problem of list items getting highlighted. The problem is this: We open the popup during vclick on the button, and we preventdefault, however, we do not handle the real "click" event, so that one propagates to the popup.
[12:49:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The solution is to hook up to "click", and do nothing else but preventDefault and stopImmediatePropagation.
[12:49:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No fix for the blue flash just yet, though.
[12:50:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you fix that in popup or event?
[12:51:01] <toddmparker> what is the blue flash? 
[12:51:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wait, not fixed.
[12:51:21] <toddmparker> is it the default webkit tap feedback, the active state?
[12:51:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes
[12:51:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: When the popup of a custom select shows up, the whole popup briefly glows blue ...
[12:51:48] <toddmparker> i see
[12:52:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We have had this issue before, and johnbender fixed it while I was on vacation.
[12:52:10] <toddmparker> and it's the native tap feedback somehow bouncing into the popup?
[12:52:37] <toddmparker> can we just nix it in css?
[12:52:38] <toddmparker> http://css-infos.net/property/-webkit-tap-highlight-color
[12:52:52] <toddmparker> -webkit-tap-highlight-color: 0;
[12:53:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wanna try that?
[12:53:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure
[12:54:17] <toddmparker> we need to embrace all the bizzaro webkit properties :)
[12:54:18] <toddmparker> http://css-infos.net/properties/webkit
[12:54:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what element gets focus, the popup or the popup container?
[12:55:07] <uGoMobi> I guess the first one
[12:55:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The container gets the focus,.
[12:55:51] <uGoMobi> ah, I guessed wrong
[12:58:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ toddmparker no dice
[13:07:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The odd highlighting thing is because the item under the mouse gets the focus.
[13:08:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The selected item gets the active class, but the item under the mouse gets the focus.
[13:08:56] <uGoMobi> hmm
[13:09:45] <toddmparker> under the mouse? in android?
[13:10:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah.
[13:10:52] <_|Nix|_> There are some serious focus issues.
[13:11:08] <_|Nix|_> The multiline text input also has the focus.
[13:11:19] <_|Nix|_> ... as does the native select.
[13:11:35] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: _|Nix|_ is testing on the SDK
[13:11:42] <_|Nix|_> Like, two items have the focus at the same time.
[13:12:03] <toddmparker> hmmm
[13:12:16] <toddmparker> is this seen on a real device or just the emulator?
[13:12:33] <uGoMobi> I see it on real device
[13:13:59] <_|Nix|_> http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/android-4.1-focus-issue.png
[13:14:19] <_|Nix|_> This is on par with WP7  ...
[13:15:19] <toddmparker> ah, i see. it is like wp7
[13:15:56] <toddmparker> is this another thing we'd fix if we used :focus instead of a focus class? uGoMobi?
[13:16:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No. The focus handling is insane.
[13:17:43] <toddmparker> i know we need to dynamically direct focus, but i wonder if we styled against focus via css pseudo, it would tend to be picked up more accurately
[13:17:55] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: actually I think we set focus styling for both :focus and .ui-focus
[13:18:07] <toddmparker> what is the issue link for this one?
[13:18:44] <uGoMobi> .ui-focus,
[13:18:44] <uGoMobi> .ui-btn:focus { }
[13:19:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no ticket yet, just noticed it today when looking into something else
[13:19:22] <uGoMobi> but I will open a new ticket for it
[13:28:10] <toddmparker> ok
[13:42:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's already a ticket for the blue flash.
[13:45:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, maybe not ... maybe this blue flash thing came up last time as it came up this time - anonymous. In any case, johnbender didn't refer to any issue # in his commit message ...
[13:46:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: which commit?
[13:48:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: 84163152
[13:53:16] <toddmparker> now we're down to a single page of 1.3 issues. 29 to go: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=19&page=2&sort=updated&state=open
[13:53:35] <johnbender> toddmparker: oh we'll have plenty more once I merge 
[13:53:39] <johnbender> :(
[13:53:44] <toddmparker> there are a bunch here I want to see if we're going to do. johnbender - i commented on a few
[13:53:53] <toddmparker> oh boy. scared
[13:54:16] <johnbender> toddmparker: the tests have made this possible at al
[13:54:24] <johnbender> but I think we'll see subtleties in timing
[13:54:46] <toddmparker> just good to get in there and clean things up
[13:54:53] <toddmparker> no mater what breaks
[13:55:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes that solved the focus outline
[13:55:11] <johnbender> issue
[13:55:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you can't reproduce it in 4.0 or 4.1 then feel free to take it out
[13:55:41] <johnbender> but we hadn't logged an issue at the time that I addressed it
[13:57:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, it seems that unwinding the stack is not enough in 4.1 ... you need to add a real timeout.
[13:57:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... much to your chagrin, no doubt.
[13:58:09] <uGoMobi> so useful these test pages... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3471#issuecomment-10527832 :(
[13:58:37] <toddmparker> nope
[14:02:22] <_|Nix|_> OK. I believe both the blue flash and the highlighting of custom select menu items are caused by the same problem. focus is given to the item underneath the mouse cursor by an event that should have had its default prevented but didn't.
[14:03:28] <_|Nix|_> In the case of the blue flash, the popup assigns focus to its container because it intercepts a focusin event that has bubbled up to the document and whose target is not a child of the popup. This is our focus loss prevention.
[14:04:19] <_|Nix|_> In the case of the stray highlight, the item under the mouse cursor is one of the list items of the custom select. It gets the focus because of the same stray mouse event.
[14:04:44] <_|Nix|_> There is no blue flash whenever the list item gets the focus, because the popup doesn't need to recapture focus, since the list item is one of its children.
