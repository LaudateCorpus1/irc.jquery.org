[07:30:26] <Wilto> ’Morning, folks.
[07:36:29] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Morning ...
[07:37:34] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Got a question for you about @keyframes ... it's not possible to prefix @keyframes with another selector, right? Like, #my-div@keyframes some-animation-name {...}
[07:38:03] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: No sir.
[07:38:09] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: The reason I ask is that I moved popup to using the fade transition for the screen, instead of the .animate(...);
[07:38:30] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: The problem is that the fade transition is defined as going from an opacity of 0 to 1 and back.
[07:38:42] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: However, the popup's screen is only supposed to go to 0.5....
[07:39:02] <Wilto> Ah, yeah. Unfortunately, the way keyframes work, you’ll need to do like… @keyframes popup-fade
[07:39:06] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: However, I wanted to inherit the speed of the animation, so that it's consistent.
[07:39:12] <Wilto> Which sucks, because there’s gonna be a ton of shared styles.
[07:39:12] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I did.
[07:39:18] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Exactly.
[07:39:33] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I hade to copy large parts of the fade transition :(
[07:39:35] <Wilto> Moral of the story: working with keyframes is kinda awful.
[07:39:46] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Why not just use transition:
[07:40:03] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: It's not like we need keyframes - I mean, it's all nice and linear.
[07:40:23] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I thought keyframes were only necessary for doing funky, non-linear stuff.
[07:40:50] <Wilto> I think Scott had originally experimented with transitions for animations, and it was really clunky.
[07:41:33] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Aha, so no @keyframes === clunky transitions?
[07:41:56] <Wilto> Lemme check; that was a little before my time. I know they’re a pain in the ass to work with, for sure.
[07:42:38] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Yeah, the fact that they're definition cannot be modified by additional selectors really sucks ...
[07:42:48] <_|Nix|_> Gah! their
[07:42:56] <_|Nix|_> I'm slipping ...
[07:44:09] <Wilto> Animations will do that to you.
[07:44:18] <_|Nix|_> :)
[07:44:32] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I guess I did benefit from CSS a little bit in this case, because I was able to do this: .ui-popup-screen.fade.out { ... }
[07:44:47] <_|Nix|_> ... and that inherits the durations from the origin .fade declaration.
[07:45:15] <Wilto> Oh, right. There’s definitely some shared stuff you can use there.
[07:46:13] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, so I maximized the usage of shared stuff, but it still sucks that I had to duplicate the @keyframes ... oh well - I'll get over it.
[07:46:42] <Wilto> Hey, you should’ve seen my face when I had to duplicate them all for the sake of -moz
[07:47:34] <_|Nix|_> Perhaps it's better that I didn't :)
[07:58:52] <Wilto> Where should that stuff live, though?
[07:59:24] <Wilto> In with the fade animation, I guess? Thinking in terms of the download builder, y’know?
[08:01:45] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: You mean the popup-fade @keyframes declaration?
[08:01:50] <Wilto> Yeah.
[08:02:12] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: jquery.mobile.popup.css, IMO ... it only applies to the popup ...
[08:02:34] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: However, it /does/ assume that the fade transition is available ...
[08:02:56] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So, I guess the popup widget depends on the fade transition ...
[08:03:41] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Do I need to add something to the define stuff at the top?
[08:03:57] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I thought that stuff was only for .js files - does it also track .css files?
[08:03:57] <Wilto> Hm.
[08:04:43] <Wilto> Yeah. //>>css: ../css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css,../css/structure/jquery.mobile.collapsible.css
[08:04:56] <Wilto> So the associated CSS dependencies go in there. But… I dunno.
[08:05:17] <Wilto> I feel like a _dependency_ here might not be best.
[08:05:38] <Wilto> Popup can work without transitions, and lord knows we should allow people to opt out of them given how incredibly inconsistent they are.
[08:06:11] <Wilto> But I don’t want to add a new checkbox for, like… “fade again (but on the popups this time),” y’know?
[08:06:25] <Wilto> Paging gseguin.
[08:06:37] <Wilto> Dr. gseguin, to #jquerymobile-dev.
[08:07:04] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I guess he's the guy to ask ...
[08:07:13] <toddparker> hey all
[08:07:18] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[08:07:35] <toddparker> catching up
[08:09:01] <toddparker> I think the overlay fade in/out keyframes and styles hold just be part of the popup css
[08:09:04] <Wilto> toddparker is here to drop the holy word on the situation.
[08:09:13] <Wilto> Agreed, now.
[08:09:15] <toddparker> it's not a page transition
[08:09:25] <toddparker> it's just an animation as part of the widget
[08:09:52] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Got a question for you about popup theming: Currently, the overlayTheme applies to the screen and the popup container. The "theme" applies to the actual div that was marked data-role='popup' ... So, if we wanted to get rid of the fade option, we'd need to change things so overlayTheme refers exclusively to screen and may be null, whereas theme refers to the popup container (which surrounds the div that was marked data-role
[08:10:30] <toddparker> yep, that's how it think it should work
[08:10:33] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: However, if we change things to be like this, there is no way to theme the actual payload div other than to add ui-body-* to it.
[08:11:03] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Fundamentally, there are 3 divs: The screen, the container, and the payload, and only 2 theme-related attributes.
[08:11:08] <toddparker> the overlayTheme is just the overlay - default to false but you can pass in a theme letter to activate the overlay
[08:11:19] <toddparker> I also think that the fade should just be part of that
[08:11:25] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK.
[08:12:01] <toddparker> if people don't want it to fade, they can just write a css override IMHO
[08:12:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: You mean, they want to have an overlayTheme, but no fade?
[08:12:25] <toddparker> ya
[08:12:48] <_|Nix|_> So, like, Bam! the whole window turns <theme colour>!
[08:12:50] <toddparker> just trying to make the API as close to dialog as we can, where applicable
[08:13:11] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Alright ... can be done.
[08:13:29] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... and then the container will theme the payload, and that's that.
[08:13:54] <toddparker> yeah
[08:14:22] <toddparker> the one thing we need to figure out is how to deal with padding in a popup
[08:14:28] <Wilto> —Wait, _|Nix|_.
[08:14:42] <Wilto> This is for the sake of a semi-transparent background on popups, yeah?
[08:14:44] <toddparker> if I drop in a list to make a menu, I probably don't want padding or even a bg theme on the popup
[08:14:49] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Correct.
[08:14:54] <toddparker> but if I'm making a tooltip, i want both
[08:15:03] <Wilto> Fade uses opacity. If you set the background using rgba(), it will still have an _opacity_ of 1.
[08:15:09] <Wilto> Even if it’s semi-transparent.
[08:15:38] <Wilto> So rgba(0,0,0,.5); opacity: 1; will be a 50% black background.
[08:15:38] <Wilto> You’d still be able to use the dialog’s fade animation.
[08:15:50] <_|Nix|_> I'm not setting the background - I'm using whatever swatch ...
[08:16:14] <_|Nix|_> The background can be a picture of lambs frolicking in a pasture, for all I know :)
[08:16:55] <Wilto> Hmm.
[08:17:00] <toddparker> I think it will probably ake sense to default to the same swatch as the page it lives in
[08:17:06] <toddparker> but not have padding
[08:17:12] <toddparker> so it's a blank slate
[08:17:39] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I think if you want padding, you should just add it yourself to the payload.
[08:17:51] <toddparker> as long as we can set data-theme="false" on the popup container to set to bg color, that would be simple
[08:17:54] <toddparker> agreed
[08:18:12] <toddparker> we already have a ui-content class that simply adds 15px of padding
[08:18:17] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The purpose of popup is to take a payload, rip it out of the page, and place it on the screen in an absolutely position div.
[08:18:19] <toddparker> so we can make an example that explains that
[08:18:28] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Deal.
[08:18:33] <toddparker> sounds good
[08:18:44] <toddparker> think that will make this as simple as possible
[08:18:59] <toddparker> i'd like to cover the popup current state and API Q's on today's call
[08:19:09] <toddparker> think you could get these few things in before the call?
[08:19:36] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I've looked into the theme/overlayTheme thing and it doesn't look that complicated ...
[08:19:57] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: There is, however, one other thing: The transition. I would like to use the same fallback mechanism as the dialogs.
[08:20:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: To that end, I would like to factor out the mechanism (which is currently inline inside a function in navigation.js) into a public function: degradedTransition = $.mobile.maybeDegradeTransition( originalTransition );
[08:21:31] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: It need not be public - but the little dance it does with looking up the transition in a hash of fallbacks is kind of important, and I don't want to copy/paste that code into popup.
[08:21:43] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'd rather create a utility that is used for both dialogs and popups.
[08:22:58] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I can run the modification by johnbender during the call. I'll put it up as a PR from my private repo.
[08:27:25] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: here is a summary of what we just discussed…let me know if this is what you understand/agree with
[08:27:25] <toddparker> - Modal overlay screen - default to none, but add if data-overlay-theme is set to a swatch.
[08:27:25] <toddparker> - Remove "Fade" as an option and just fade in overlay screen if one is specified, CSS override of keyframes if needed
[08:27:25] <toddparker> - Popup container - inherits the theme from the parent page by default, data-theme attr can be set to a swatch letter or to "false" or "none" to have the conner have an invisible background (just won't write in the ui-content-a/b/c class)
[08:27:25] <toddparker> - Popup won't have any padding by default to let widgets like lists (menus), photos, etc. be edgeless. To add padding, recommend people add the "ui-content" class to the popup wrapper add the standard 15px of page padding or write custom styles as needed
[08:28:09] <toddparker> I think that transition fallback change makes sense
[08:29:27] <Wilto> This is why toddparker is our fearless leader.
[08:29:29] <Wilto> See also: http://wil.to/_/jqm-fearless-leader.png
[08:30:10] <toddparker> Wilto: always stacking away material to extort you with later. especially when it's a picture of you with a 'stache
[08:30:33] <Wilto> I call it “job security.”
[08:36:25] <johnbender> gseguin: ping
[08:39:08] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I agree.
[08:39:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that sounds fine, just prefix it with an underscore in the meantime
[08:40:02] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it might be nice to start a navigation sub object
[08:40:29] <johnbender> not important though
[08:40:44] <johnbender> I would add the prefix it it's private
[08:54:03] <gseguin> I didn't do it
[08:54:17] <gseguin> good morning
[08:54:31] <gseguin> was it the right thing to say?
[08:55:01] * gseguin scrolls up to catch up
[08:57:45] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: what do you want to know about the //>>css: comment?
[08:58:34] <gseguin> johnbender: 'sup?
[08:59:03] <Wilto> It’s always a safe bet, starting with “I didn’t do it.”
[09:01:12] <gseguin> Wilto, _|Nix|_ that //>>css comment is to indicate direct css dependencies for a component
[09:01:44] <gseguin> the builder uses it to build the css bundle
[09:02:00] <Wilto> Oh, yeah. I just wanted to tag you in on any builder-y talk.
[09:02:45] <Wilto> Todd posted The Official Plan about half an hour ago.
[09:06:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[09:07:05] <toddparker> i'm working on an agenda for today. will post a google doc link in a few for you all to add stuff
[09:07:26] <toddparker> johnbender: i need you to add in some of the infrastructure stuff you're doing too - grunt, etc.
[09:11:52] <johnbender> toddparker: kk
[09:11:56] <johnbender> gseguin: I figured it out
[09:12:13] <johnbender> I was having an issue translating the dot args from the node js cmd to the require config
[09:12:29] <johnbender> some simple logging in the r.js bin showed the way
[09:12:46] <johnbender> gseguin: the js target is finished save for minification btw
[09:13:36] <johnbender> gseguin: it was less difficult with the helpers in place
[09:13:47] <johnbender> docs is going to be a bitch ...
[09:14:06] <johnbender> find / exec does a lot of work for us

[09:28:09] <toddparker> feel free to add/edit as needed
[09:28:36] <toddparker> we probably won't get thru everything but if we get through the first half, we'll be in good shape
[09:28:53] <toddparker> trying to do a more detailed agenda format for the UI and core guys to read
[09:30:21] <toddparker> johnbender: what are a few key infra things you're tackling other than grunt?
[09:30:32] <toddparker> even if they are down the road
[09:39:44] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Correct me if I'm wrong: It should be possible for the user to completely turn off the theme for the popup container, including the inherited theme, by setting data-theme='none' or false or whatever - meaning that the user intentionally wants the popup to be transparent.
[09:40:16] <toddparker> yes
[09:40:24] <toddparker> i think I mentioned that above
[09:40:31] <toddparker> but yes
[09:40:52] <toddparker> set theme to false or none (support both?) and you get a transparent popup
[09:41:02] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OKOK, just making extra sure I understood correctly, because transparent popups look really bad, because there's a shadow surrounding a transparent popup, unless you turn off shadow too.
[09:43:08] <toddparker> right
[09:43:19] <toddparker> this is a case where you want to do something custom
[09:43:33] <johnbender> toddparker: ah, sorry
[09:43:38] <johnbender> nothing really
[09:43:39] <toddparker> though I think a transparent bg might look good for embedded widgets like inset listviews
[09:43:42] <johnbender> just porting the build to grunt ...
[09:44:11] <toddparker> there were others that you and born were talking about
[09:44:17] <toddparker> even if they are for later
[09:45:15] <johnbender> toddparker: you mean changes to the build?
[09:45:17] <_|Nix|_> We really should have a string-to-truthy converter ... I find myself doing if ( value === "false" || value === "none" ) value = null;
[09:45:24] <johnbender> toddparker: or other items entirely
[09:45:33] <toddparker> yeah johnbender - build, testing, infra
[09:45:47] <johnbender> toddparker: cool, if you share the doc with my google account I'll add stuff
[09:46:00] <toddparker> public: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xiJPR3oGU4uhqkWpvGXHNtAwmVPBpSvA4-ZRhRh7k6Q/edit?pli=1
[09:47:13] <johnbender> toddparker: it says view only? I'm not sure how to opperate this thing
[09:48:03] * johnbender needs food
[09:48:05] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I think that I will go with the special value of 'none' for turning off the theme. So, if data-theme is not specified at all, it will be inherited, but if it is specified as 'none', it will not be inherited.
[09:48:13] <toddparker> heh
[09:49:06] <toddparker> fixed permissions
[09:49:09] <toddparker> you can edit now
[09:58:28] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: we should just check to see what we use for a special value elsewhere
[09:59:08] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: is there a ticket/PR for that change to the widget factory to allow for runtime changes to options?
[10:01:53] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: There is: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3820
[10:01:53] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (1m, 2w ago): On-the-fly options
[10:02:47] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: just checked and we use "none" so that's a go
[10:03:33] <toddparker> I updated the agenda with that
[10:06:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK, but then I will not accept "false", OK?
[10:07:04] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The reason is that "false" turns into false, which makes me have to explicitly check x === null instead of !x. The latter would be better.

[10:38:48] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK then, I think I got all the changes in ... Unless some yawning abyss of an issue crops up, I think I'll start turning my attention to the documentation, to make sure it's in sync with the changes.
[10:39:23] <toddparker> good idea
[10:39:42] <toddparker> i can clean up the examples a bit right now on the index page

[10:49:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Where are you seeing the overlay?

[10:49:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] [popup docs] Update doc headers - Gabriel Schulhof
[10:49:28] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Most examples have a data-overlay-theme.
[10:49:38] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The first two examples do not have an overlay theme.
[10:50:07] <toddparker> ah, i see
[10:50:22] <toddparker> i see data-theme-null when i inspect the popup
[10:50:29] <toddparker> is that a JS error?
[10:50:36] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: All the popups under "Now on to some cool examples" have data-overlay-theme ...
[10:50:44] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: No, that's bad. Lemme check ...
[10:50:48] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Which popup?
[10:52:57] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: There used to be a "ui-body-null" problem, but it's not present anymore, I don't think.
[10:53:03] <toddparker> the first one, no settings
[10:54:13] <toddparker> it looks like you're wrapping the original popup container with another element
[10:54:20] <toddparker> that will make this harder to style
[10:54:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'm not seeing that.
[10:54:55] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The element that has the data-role='popup' attribute is indeed being wrapped. That's always been the case.
[10:55:38] <toddparker> i wonder if we can avoid that
[10:55:57] <toddparker> let me mull that over
[10:56:01] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Well, that might be worth diving into ...
[10:56:01] <toddparker> i may be over-thinking
[10:56:15] <toddparker> wrapping always makes it tricker
[10:56:22] <Wilto> Anyone dying to ask me anything at the meeting today? Might play hooky, if not.
[10:56:56] <toddparker> that's fine with me
[10:57:51] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I think it's important to wrap, because we need to ensure that a popup has the css attributes contained in the class ui-popup-container. Now, if we add that class to the actual payload, then it may interact unfavourably with whatever classes the payload already has.
[10:57:52] <Wilto> Cool; thanks.
[10:58:14] <toddparker> yeah, i can see that

[12:27:42] <johnbender> I'll try to do that this afternoon
[12:35:51] <johnbender> gseguin: feel free to dive in on the grunt branch at this point
[12:36:09] <johnbender> I'm debating whether I want to spend much more time on converting the docs / zip

[12:42:15] <johnbender> agcolom: I fixed the css of the autodividers page and they appear to be working locally so we'll have to see what happens when it gets dumped on test
[12:44:43] <johnbender> ah
[12:44:45] <johnbender> I'm a moron
[12:44:49] <johnbender> I even thought of this today
[12:47:08] <johnbender> toddparker: the reason why it "worked for me" is that the index.php was updated but the meta module for the build wasn't
[12:47:19] <johnbender> updated to include autodividers that it

[13:07:51] <agcolom> Hi, here are the 2 PR that I'd like someone to take a look at to ensure technical correctness:
[13:07:51] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3919 (jqm orientation change expertise)
[13:07:51] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4256 (php expertise needed)

[13:07:52] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (2d, 5h ago): Docs: Suggestion to renew the self-submit form (forms-sample-selfsubmit.php)
[13:17:10] <toddparker> nice johnbender - you fixed up autodividers
[13:17:18] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-autodividers.html
[13:25:12] <agcolom> yes and I've just fixed the header icons. so cherry picking in a minute... hope all goes ok ;-)
[13:27:50] <gseguin> johnbender: you did you merge 3980-fix onto master as well ?
[13:31:07] <johnbender> gseguin: I did
[13:31:13] <gseguin> cool
[13:31:17] <johnbender> double checking
[13:31:26] <johnbender> yep
[13:31:42] <agcolom> gseguin, I've made a change to autodividers (header icons) and I'm trying to cherry pick...
[13:31:44] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: toddparker: kinblas: so keep navigation oddness in the back of your mind when you do the testing
[13:31:59] <johnbender> gseguin: autodividers isn't in 1.1-stable
[13:32:01] <johnbender> it's a new feature
[13:32:03] <johnbender> so it's master onely
[13:32:05] <johnbender> *only
[13:32:17] <johnbender> it'll make it into 1.2
[13:32:28] <johnbender> 1.1.* is only for bug fixes
[13:32:31] <agcolom> ok, so that's why I can't cherrypick?
[13:32:34] <johnbender> yep
[13:33:05] <gseguin> agcolom: yes, we cherry-pick only bug fixes into 1.1.1
[13:33:11] <agcolom> ok... so what I did is ok then and I don't need to do anything else with git? (except my comment should have said 1.2 I suppose?)
[13:33:48] <gseguin> the targetting to 1.2 should be done in the issue tracker
[13:34:01] <gseguin> with the milestone field
[13:37:41] <johnbender> agcolom: did you already push your commit to github?
[13:37:54] * johnbender goes to check
[13:38:05] <johnbender> ahh it's there
[13:38:06] <johnbender> ok
[13:38:48] <johnbender> in the future if you want, _before you push to github_, you can do a `git commit --amend "new commit message"` to change the last commit's commit message
[13:39:39] <agcolom> ok but that on the local machine right?
[13:40:11] <agcolom> (I did the change on github directly. is it possible to do the same?
[13:41:07] <agcolom> That would be to change my [1.1.1] to [1.2]?
[13:41:49] <agcolom> I'm happy to try if you want me to. Do you want me to try?
[13:43:19] <gseguin> agcolom: you can't amend a commit that's already been pushed
[13:44:12] <gseguin> the changes that you make through the github web ui are commited and pushed immediately
[13:44:23] <agcolom> ah ok sorry :-(
[13:44:28] <gseguin> that's ok
[13:44:37] <gseguin> not a big deal
[13:44:51] <gseguin> maybe add a comment to that commit
[13:44:55] <gseguin> on github
[13:45:13] <agcolom> ok, will do now. Shall I say actually for [1.2]
[13:45:18] <gseguin> just in case we look at it later on, so we know
[13:45:23] <gseguin> yup
[13:47:30] <agcolom> ok, done. had to remove the [ ] around 1.1.1 as it was making it clickable
[13:49:58] <gseguin> cool, thanks agcolom

[14:05:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs: Adding missing data-id attribute for headers - Maurice Gottlieb
[14:05:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #4282 from MauriceG/patch-94 - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[14:09:16] <toddparker> agcolom: that bracket convention was mainly for me because I was pulling docs changes in from the web UI that needed to be cherry picked later into the stable branch
[14:09:34] <agcolom> ah ok...
[14:10:07] <toddparker> so if you're making sure that docs changes that apply to both 1.1.1 (1.1-stable branch) and 1.2 (master) are applied when you make a change or grab a PR, you can probably just skip that step
[14:11:00] <agcolom> ok, I thought gseguin wanted that comment to check nothing was forgotten...??
[14:11:01] <toddparker> so the only important distinction is that any docs changes that are ONLY for 1.2 like the popup or list view auto dividers should only go into master and not be cherry picked into 1.0-stable
[14:11:24] <toddparker> because then we'd have docs mentioning features that don't yet exist
[14:11:29] <agcolom> yes, I've just learnt that...
[14:11:37] <toddparker> well, that note can't hurt
[14:11:37] <agcolom> sure...
[14:11:56] <toddparker> so if you all want to keep doing that, fine with me
[14:12:07] <toddparker> be easy to spot all the docs changes
[14:12:25] <agcolom> ok... I'm still in learning mode with git, so I prefer to play safe!
[14:12:49] <toddparker> sure, sure
[14:13:45] <toddparker> we pretty much live in master for the docs and just ask ourselves if an edit would make sense in 1.1 and, if so, we cherry pick it over
[14:14:57] <agcolom> yes, so minor changes to the docs like typos and omissions to get cherry-picked, right?

[14:17:20] <agcolom> gseguin, please do not delete our long irc discussion, as I need all those notes and git commands ;-) Thank you :-)
[14:18:00] <gseguin> if you're using irccloud you should have it available anytime
[14:19:27] <agcolom> great, I'm going to copy all in a document as well.. it's too valuable!!!
[14:19:45] <gseguin> :)
[14:25:51] <gseguin> ouch the autodividers thinggy broke something
[14:25:55] <toddparker> _|Nix|_:  Just tested the overlays and the theme and overlay stuff looks good -- http://jsbin.com/ohufuv/7
[14:25:55] <gseguin> looking into it
[14:26:03] <toddparker> yeah gseguin?
[14:27:05] <gseguin> maybe a false alarm, I'm looking
[14:29:06] <tbenzige> toddparker: you around?
[14:29:15] <toddparker> _|Nix|_:  Odd, this test page doesn't blink at all in Chrome but does in the docs so maybe there are more docs styles causing this - http://jsbin.com/ohufuv/7
[14:29:19] <toddparker> yeah tbenzige
[14:30:19] <agcolom> just tested http://jsbin.com/ohufuv/7 in FF12 and they look beautiful
[14:30:53] <toddparker> yeah, pretty cool
[14:31:05] <toddparker> I need to figure out the padding thing on these
[14:31:39] <agcolom> Just an idea (don't shoot me ;-) ) could they be moveable as well once on the screen?
[14:32:05] <toddparker> NO
[14:32:09] <toddparker> ;)
[14:32:12] <agcolom> I'm happy with a plain NO answer
[14:32:19] <toddparker> that would add a bunch of complexity
[14:32:29] <agcolom> yes... I thought so ;)
[14:32:31] <toddparker> these are just for little doodads
[14:32:38] <toddparker> not a modal dialog
[14:33:30] <agcolom> modal dialogs are not moveable either I think or did I miss something?
[14:34:28] <toddparker> right
[14:34:37] <toddparker> our dialogs are really just pages, styled as dialogs
[14:34:56] <toddparker> on mobile the multiple windows thing isn't as common
[14:35:11] <toddparker> better demo: http://jsbin.com/ohufuv/11
[14:36:59] <agcolom> beautiful!!!!
[14:37:43] <gseguin> ok found out what was wrong with the autodivider
[14:37:45] <gseguin> fixing
[14:38:15] <toddparker> thanks gseguin
[14:38:15] <agcolom> the position of the picture need tweaking a bit as it has square corners while the popup has rounded one, otherwise It's simply brilliant! Beautifula addition
[14:39:27] <toddparker> yeah, this will be a really useful widget
[14:39:38] <toddparker> need to tidy up some CSS for sure
[14:39:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/DLOeWA
[14:39:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed .js extension from the listview.autodividers module name - Ghislain Seguin
[14:40:04] <toddparker> ah
[14:41:33] <agcolom> I think they look so beautiful that I wanted to touch it (hence the idea of moving it, also because you can see the page underneath). You'll see I won't be only one to ask ;-) be prepared to answer that one many times I think ;)
[14:41:43] <toddparker> heh
[14:41:46] <toddparker> probably
[14:42:04] <toddparker> agree that the photo positioning is off
[14:42:20] <agcolom> ok, bedtime for me goodnight everyone
[14:42:29] <toddparker> g'night!
[14:43:11] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: looks like the positioning is a bit off - on wider widgets like the photo or dialog, it's shifted off ~20px to the right (too wide)
[14:54:11] <gseguin> johnbender: you just fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4094
[14:54:12] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4094 on jquery-mobile (zpmaxx; 2w, 1d ago): JQM 1.1: Back button fires "pagechange" twice
[14:54:16] <gseguin> nice job!
[14:54:22] <toddparker> sweet
[14:54:36] <toddparker> better popup demos: http://jsbin.com/ohufuv/16
[14:55:59] <johnbender> gseguin: yah buddy
[14:56:02] <johnbender> super nice
[14:59:49] <toddparker> neat little widget
[15:01:14] <gseguin> nice job with the popup demo!
[15:03:08] <gseguin> johnbender: I think you also fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4102
[15:03:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4102 on jquery-mobile (cjindustries; 2w, 1d ago): "Back" links with allowSamePageTransition=true problems
[15:03:58] * johnbender fixes all the things
[15:03:59] <gseguin> dude! that commit is powerful
[15:04:14] <johnbender> gseguin: the other way to look at it is that the original commit was bad :(
[15:05:30] <gseguin> And you merged that branch into 1.1.1 right johnbender ?
[15:11:11] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I did that first
[15:11:16] <johnbender> gseguin: double checking
[15:11:26] <johnbender> yap
[15:22:41] <johnbender> toddparker: are we supporting Core 1.6.4 for 1.2 - autodividers is using the on method
[15:26:57] <gseguin> I was just going to raise that issue
[15:27:16] <gseguin> I think we should drop support for 1.6 in 1.2
[15:27:44] <gseguin> an move to .on .off and away from .delegate
[15:27:51] <gseguin> is that crazy talk ?
[15:28:18] <johnbender> gseguin: I dunno I think it would be nice to support the others until it becomes painful
[15:28:21] <johnbender> ie
[15:28:26] <johnbender> when they actually remove those
[15:28:39] <johnbender> honestly, who cares otherwise
[15:29:00] <johnbender> not forcing people to upgrade jquery is a nice thing to do
[15:29:10] <johnbender> SIGNALS OF PROJECT MATURITY
[15:30:19] <gseguin> ok, then we need to change listview.autodividers
[15:33:05] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[15:33:06] <johnbender> :(
[15:33:12] <johnbender> shouldn't be too hard
[15:35:40] <johnbender> gseguin: doing it now

[15:42:58] <johnbender> well we need it to get master to pass
[15:43:08] <johnbender> it's got two failures that I can see so far
[15:43:14] <johnbender> hopefully the other one is spurious

[15:46:45] <johnbender> select tests in chrome
[15:46:54] <johnbender> and liview in chrome
[15:46:58] <johnbender> *listview
[15:47:02] <johnbender> you should be on the email
[15:47:36] <johnbender> seems odd that the listview 1.6.4 tests weren't failing
[15:47:54] <gseguin> duh! yeah got the email
[16:07:24] <johnbender> gseguin: sigh 1.6.4 is breaking all over the place on stable :(
