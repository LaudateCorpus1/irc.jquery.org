[04:33:26] <MauriceG> Morning all!
[05:20:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/jtGFYw
[05:20:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (popup): update examples page - Jasper de Groot
[05:20:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (popup): rewording - Jasper de Groot
[05:32:05] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Hi! Me again...  :-)   at http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html, changing to options, methods, events -> the left menu misses "Page loader widget"
[05:33:36] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG, nice catch again!
[05:34:33] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: same for listviews were autodividers is missing
[05:34:39] <uGoMobi> where*
[05:34:44] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  I've told you yesterday already ...    btw: nice work the new popup example page. Indeed.
[05:35:13] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: thanks
[05:35:43] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: "I've told you yesterday already"... about the listview navmenu you mean?
[05:36:00] <uGoMobi> must have missed that, sorry
[05:36:14] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:   no! about the popup
[05:36:42] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:36:47] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: at listview startpage the menu header is also missing
[05:37:35] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: same for toolbar, content, forms ...
[05:37:37] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yeah, that goes for the startpages of all components
[05:37:55] <MauriceG> except pages ...
[05:38:20] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: those were full width menus
[05:38:44] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: that was Todd  :-)
[05:38:54] <uGoMobi> i know
[05:39:39] <uGoMobi> ok, will fix the navmenus now
[05:40:01] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: cool. Another bulk job for you ...
[05:40:39] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: unfortunately this can't be done en masse
[05:40:47] <uGoMobi> but it are just a few pages
[05:42:21] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  where is the colorful city image in the popup examples?  I miss that one !
[05:42:58] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html button "Photo"
[05:43:14] <MauriceG> cool!  I miss this
[05:44:34] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: btw:  I think, at  docs/_assets/images the version.png can be dropped, what do you mean?  It was 1.1.0 Final and no image banner is used anymore.
[05:45:35] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yeah, we don't have a fallback or anything, right?
[05:46:03] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: boah! really colorful and it looks "cool extreme" with that overlay !
[05:46:06] <uGoMobi> will do a search if there is still a link to the image, just to be sure
[05:48:50] <MauriceG> I think, a fallback to an 1.1.0-Final image in 1.2.0 a is not there and should be avoided. The banner is pure CSS as of a WTH commit from Wilto ...
[05:50:35] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: in the the docs css file there is still a link to version.png
[05:50:53] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: probably the docs css needs to be cleanup
[05:50:59] <uGoMobi> anyway... first the menus
[05:51:11] <uGoMobi> cleaned up* ^
[05:53:33] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/examples.html throws 404 now ...
[05:54:35] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: not here
[05:57:14] <MauriceG> sorry, I always get this 404 issues in the docs, when I've opened the page template pages. Never mind.
[05:58:05] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: I have to make a full reload then and it works again ...
[05:58:30] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: are you on Chrome?
[05:59:04] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Safari 5.1.7 Win
[05:59:22] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ah ok, Chrome can have a nasty cache too
[06:00:00] <uGoMobi> but you can use incognito mode
[06:00:25] <MauriceG> the template pages load another jqm version and somehow I get this issues.
[06:06:48] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: 1 exmaple:  Chrome/Win  open http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/examples.html -> video -> close -> single page template -> back -> click map popup : What do you see ?
[06:09:50] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: WTF
[06:09:58] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I see a video :/
[06:10:17] <uGoMobi> and no map
[06:10:34] <MauriceG> never mind!  I've this issues since years (and nobody believe me ;-)
[06:10:59] <uGoMobi> is it only with iframes?
[06:11:29] <uGoMobi> why does nobody believe you? you can see it right away
[06:11:30] <MauriceG> It is only if you open one of the template pages
[06:13:12] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: the template pages load jqm 1.1.1   This must be the issue ...
[06:20:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 4 new commits to master: http://git.io/RoH8_w
[06:20:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (popup): example page rewording and fix typos. - Jasper de Groot

[06:22:03] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Thanks Jasper !
[06:22:41] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: np, thank you!
[06:23:00] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: trying to figure out now what's going on with the iframe source
[06:36:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/K1OHng
[06:36:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs: removed superfluous version image and CSS. - Jasper de Groot
[06:36:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Updated scrollview experiment - Jasper de Groot
[06:56:25] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: FYI  popup iframe issue not raised on FF 13.0 / Win
[06:57:07] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ok thanks
[07:01:30] <toddparker> morning all
[07:04:05] <agcolom> hi!
[07:06:43] <toddparker> hi agcolom
[07:06:51] <toddparker> thanks for those edits
[07:07:51] <agcolom> toddparker: you're welcome!
[07:27:52] <toddparker> uGoMobi: thanks for fixing up the docs
[07:27:58] <toddparker> MauriceG: good catch
[07:28:24] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i like how you handled the html in a collapsible
[07:28:51] <toddparker> be cool to add a docs script that somehow makes it easy for us to view source like that without repeating code
[07:28:55] <toddparker> for docs. 2.0
[07:29:28] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yeah, would be nice
[07:29:56] <uGoMobi> toddparker: we might also want to improve styling of code blocks
[07:30:25] <uGoMobi> smaller font and wrap them in ui-bar or something, to improve readability
[07:31:44] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I am now in doubt about where to add the panel example
[07:36:45] <toddparker> uGoMobi: we could break those advanced demos up
[07:37:04] <toddparker> into 3 pages: photos, maps/video (iframe), panels
[07:37:09] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes, I think we should
[07:37:12] <toddparker> and link to each from the index
[07:37:18] <toddparker> cool
[07:37:26] <toddparker> +1 on code formatting
[07:37:34] <Wilto> What’s up, mobros.
[07:37:42] <uGoMobi> hi Wilto
[07:37:57] <Wilto> What’s the rumpus?
[07:38:01] <Wilto> kinblas!
[07:38:01] <toddparker> for code hilighting http://prismjs.com looks pretty awesome.
[07:38:12] <Wilto> Long time no see, holmes.
[07:38:13] <toddparker> he here?
[07:38:30] <kinblas> toddparker: in spirit :-)
[07:38:42] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:40:47] <toddparker> hey kin
[07:40:55] <toddparker> agcolom: re:
[07:40:56] <toddparker> Under Listview Autodividers, the "Simply add the data-autodivider attribute" should be Simply add the data-autodividers attribute (with an 's')
[07:40:59] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I am not really fan of code blocks that have srollbars, to be honest
[07:41:17] <toddparker> The "s" sounds better but will it be confusing since that's the actual data attr?
[07:41:28] <toddparker> uGoMobi: me neither
[07:41:30] <agcolom> toddparker: yes, there is an 's' at the end of the attribute
[07:41:39] <toddparker> i just like a lightweight hilighter
[07:41:46] <toddparker> ah, oops
[07:42:04] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ah ok, yeah that's nice indeed
[07:42:05] <toddparker> fixed
[07:42:23] <agcolom> (I was not suggesting to add the "with an 's') in the text ;-)
[07:42:32] <toddparker> agcolom: for the first comment, that change log includes changes in 1.1.2 and 1.2 from MauriceG
[07:42:54] <uGoMobi> IE8 has a problem with jQuery's prop()... nice :(
[07:43:22] <toddparker> IE is such a pain
[07:43:37] <uGoMobi> yeah, I feel it
[07:44:22] <agcolom> toddparker: ok, but 1.1.2 is not going out before 1.2 or is it?
[07:45:57] <agcolom> or do you mean the changes from 1.1.2 to 1.2 as in something that will happen in the future?
[07:46:24] * agcolom is confused!
[07:51:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/sDyp1A
[07:51:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (popup): switching from prop() to attr() to make it work on old IE. - Jasper de Groot
[08:01:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/7sfb7g
[08:01:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Updated supported browers - added Jellybean, Tizen - toddparker
[08:58:16] <toddparker> agcolom: i see what you mean
[08:58:46] <toddparker> that 1.1.2 mark are changes that have been picked over to 1.1-stable and will eventually be in 1.1.2 but it's confusing
[08:59:14] <toddparker> MauriceG: is what i just said correct?
[08:59:45] <toddparker> johnbender: you're still working on getting 1.2 alpha all square, right?
[09:03:33] <johnbender> toddparker: correct
[09:03:53] <johnbender> toddparker: there's an annoying issue with the directories in the zip file that I'm looking into
[09:04:50] <agcolom> johnbender: when you have time, please remind me that I have a volley-ball question to ask you...
[09:07:35] <MauriceG> agcolom: toddparker  Sorry for delay:  Yes, this is correct.  ( I can change that all are 1.2.0  ... )
[09:55:11] <toddparker> thanks MauriceG
[09:56:28] <toddparker> johnbender: no worries. i'll be in a call for the next 2 hours or so
[09:56:42] <toddparker> i think uGoMobi is adding some examples to the docs too
[09:56:53] <toddparker> but we're close to being ready
[09:56:56] <toddparker> just let me know
[10:10:58] <johnbender> toddparker: looks like we're good to go

[10:26:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] missed update from old makefile - John Bender
[10:28:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you around?
[10:29:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you too
[10:29:07] <johnbender> I have a question(s) for each of you
[10:29:10] <johnbender> wel
[10:29:15] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I am here
[10:29:27] <johnbender> one of them is more of a statement but I'll phrase it as a question so it sounds nicer
[10:29:36] <johnbender> uGoMobi: the events for the popup?
[10:29:57] <johnbender> would you mind altering those to use this._trigger( "event" )
[10:30:02] <johnbender> you can leave the prefix off
[10:30:09] <johnbender> so
[10:30:32] <johnbender> trigger( "popupfoo" ) becomes _trigger("foo")
[10:30:44] <johnbender> the widget factory has a mechanism for that so we can define the prefix
[10:30:57] <johnbender> by default it's the popup's name
[10:32:07] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that assumes that you're triggering the event on the the same DOM element that this.element represents
[10:33:02] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, I think I get it
[10:34:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi: a recent example https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/slider.js#L197
[10:34:23] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/slider.js#L233
[10:36:21] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #500: FAILURE in 5.2 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/500/
[10:36:51] <johnbender> hmm
[10:36:57] <johnbender> looks like a broke something
[10:37:04] <uGoMobi> johnbender: it's just the prefix part that's not clear to me yet
[10:37:26] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it's just the name of the popup
[10:37:28] <johnbender> err
[10:37:29] <johnbender> widget
[10:37:32] <uGoMobi> johnbender: this.element.trigger( "popupbeforeposition" );
[10:37:32] <johnbender> so in the case of slider
[10:37:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that would be this._trigger( "beforeposition" )
[10:37:55] <johnbender> popup is prepended
[10:38:01] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok clear
[10:38:02] <johnbender> because it's the name of the widget
[10:38:22] <uGoMobi> wasn't sure about leaving out "element"
[10:39:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah that's the assumption of _trigger is that you're triggering it on the widget element
[10:39:19] <johnbender> which is good in 99.9999% of cases
[10:39:31] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ah ok
[10:52:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What's up?
[10:52:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4777
[10:52:32] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4777 on jquery-mobile (mruffolo; 2h, 26m ago): deep linking with query parameters via the page-params plugin no longer working in 1.1.1
[10:53:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think the hash needs to be cleaned before using it as a selector
[10:55:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ...
[10:55:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: still trying to figure out where and I thought you might have an idea
[10:55:48] <tbenzige> johnbender: ping
[10:56:22] <johnbender> tbenzige: yo
[10:56:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll try to reproduce that using a similar URL ...
[10:56:46] <tbenzige> johnbender; saw toddparker's blog post. could you ping me when you guys do the build for 1.2 so i can update TR?
[10:57:07] <johnbender> tbenzige: it's pushed
[10:57:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: kk
[10:57:25] <tbenzige> johnbender: sweet! thanks. when is the blog post going out?
[10:57:26] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: it's alpha release
[10:57:48] <johnbender> tbenzige: not sure
[10:57:56] <johnbender> tbenzige: it is alpha though
[10:58:22] <tbenzige> ah ok. what's the url to the JS file?
[10:59:25] <tbenzige> johnbender: ^
[10:59:36] <tbenzige> just curious
[11:01:50] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[11:01:51] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #501: FIXED in 23 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/501/
[11:02:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I can't reproduce this.
[11:03:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah I'm having trouble too
[11:03:35] <johnbender> :(
[11:03:41] <johnbender> let's see if he can help us
[11:03:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: sorry to bother you
[11:03:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP.
[11:04:32] <uGoMobi> johnbender: if I change the events it doesn't work anymore
[11:05:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We should create a jsbin template whenever we do a release. The template should point to the built sources for the release and it is that template that should be mentioned in the README.md. The template currently mentioned in there points to the latest master.
[11:05:51] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm, that's tough because we might want someone to test against latest
[11:06:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: maybe the language should include something about the fact that people should test against the release they are using and master
[11:06:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, but that's easy. We just grab the template mentioned in master.
[11:06:20] <johnbender> to see if it's fixed
[11:06:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah.
[11:07:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think it may not be necessary though because these sites pick up jQM releases on their own, IINM.
[11:07:17] <johnbender> ah
[11:07:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, you can choose jQM 1.1.1 from a combo, or something.
[11:07:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: At least jsfiddle has that, IIRC ... not sure about jsbin ...
[11:08:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: jsbin doesn't have jQM 1.1.1 yet.
[11:54:16] <toddparker> we can make out our jsbin template with the correct CDN links
[11:54:19] <toddparker> good idea
[11:54:44] <toddparker> johnbender: demos should be ok now?
[12:15:48] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Hi! My understanding was that we want people to check in latest to see whether bugs are fixed....
[12:16:56] <agcolom> So maybe we could have 2 templates?
[12:17:17] <agcolom> toddparker: ^
[12:18:07] <tbenzige> danheberden: ping
[12:18:17] <danheberden> tbenzige: yo
[12:18:30] <tbenzige> i think i missed the memo on the server switch
[12:18:43] <tbenzige> how do i gain ssh access / where is control.jquerymobile.com ?
[12:19:04] <danheberden> gnarf has been foot to the floor with getting things switched before (mt) pulled the plug on those servers
[12:19:23] <danheberden> gnarf ^ re: location of control.jquerymobile.com
[12:19:39] <danheberden> and tbenzige do you have access to github.com/jquery/infrastructure?
[12:20:07] <johnbender> toddparker: did you want me to do anything else with deploying alpha?
[12:20:09] <tbenzige> danheberden: i used to, but i think i had you remove me
[12:20:12] <johnbender> *the alpha
[12:21:02] <danheberden> tbenzige can you pm me your key?
[12:21:07] <danheberden> so i can make an issue regarding it?
[12:21:14] <tbenzige> i'll email it to ya
[12:21:24] <danheberden> k
[12:24:55] <danheberden> tbenzige: was it just control.jquerymobile.com you need access to?
[12:24:59] <danheberden> *is it just
[12:25:12] <tbenzige> danheberden: yeah. but ssh access would be nice too
[12:25:24] <danheberden> that's what i meant, k - adding the ticket
[12:25:34] <gnarf> tbenzige / danheberden - what exactly is control.jquerymobile.com ?
[12:25:48] <danheberden> ( i was hoping you'd know gnarf, lol )
[12:26:10] <gnarf> i wasn't aware of its existence during the move, where was it hosted, what did it do?
[12:26:32] <tbenzige> gnarf: it's a page that executes a script which pulls in changes from jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller master to /themeroller-test and /themeroller
[12:29:11] <gnarf> tbenzige: so i assume it sat beside jquerymobile.com?
[12:29:34] <gnarf> you should be able to ssh to jqadmin@jquerymobile.com if you had ssh to the old server
[12:32:06] <gnarf> tbenzige: i believe i asked at the time what this was, and noone could tell me so i didn't copy it over
[12:32:18] <gnarf> do you still need it, or can what you need to be done be done with ssh access?
[12:32:24] <tbenzige> gnarf: well when i try i get this: https://gist.github.com/0a1c9f21ff84cf954032
[12:32:36] <tbenzige> gnarf: i do still need the control page
[12:32:55] <gnarf> tbenzige: delete line 1 of /Users/tbenzige/.ssh/known_hosts
[12:32:55] <gnarf> ;)
[12:33:02] <tbenzige> gnarf: alright
[12:33:07] <gnarf> tbenzige: alright give me a few minutes, ill set it back up
[12:34:07] <tbenzige> gnarf: thanks so much
[12:35:01] <johnbender> tbenzige: hmm that's unfortunate, does ssh-keygen on mac not have  -R ?
[12:35:34] <johnbender> the feedback is less obvious than the ubuntu's latest (it tells you the command to use to remove the host from your known_hosts
[12:35:37] <johnbender> which is nic
[12:35:37] <tbenzige> johnbender: not sure. it's working now that i took out the line in known_hosts
[12:35:39] <johnbender> *nice
[12:35:41] <gnarf> tbenzige: can you test it?
[12:36:05] <gnarf> tbenzige: control.jquerymobile.com that is
[12:36:09] <gnarf> i might need to chown something
[12:36:22] <tbenzige> gnarf: login works, but it's missing git
[12:36:30] <tbenzige> sh: git: command not found
[12:36:37] <gnarf> fixed
[12:37:10] <tbenzige> gnarf: great! now… error: cannot open .git/FETCH_HEAD: Permission denied
[12:37:53] <gnarf> fixed?
[12:38:08] <gnarf> i did a chown -R www-data /srv/control.jquerymobile.com
[12:38:19] <tbenzige> gnarf: i think it worked
[12:38:48] <tbenzige> gnarf: success! thank you very much
[12:39:23] <gnarf> tbenzige: no prob! sorry it was broken, apparently apache2 requires "abc.domain.com" vhost to be declared before the "*.domain.com" vhost :)
[12:39:39] <tbenzige> :D
[12:39:44] <gnarf> i HAD copied it over
[12:48:26] <johnbender> toddparker: heading to the DMV for a bit just let me know if you need anything else in terms of deployment
[12:50:49] <toddparker> ok j
[12:50:55] <toddparker> johnbender
[12:51:39] <toddparker> the version flag seems a bit off - http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0-alpha.1/
[12:51:49] <toddparker> uGoMobi: maybe something changed recently?
[12:52:35] <toddparker> johnbender: the docs seem a little out of date
[12:52:40] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I think it's mostly a matter of the text doesn't fit
[12:52:45] <toddparker> we made some updates in the last 24 hours
[12:52:50] <toddparker> ah uGoMobi
[12:53:21] <toddparker> maybe we drop the .1
[13:04:36] <toddparker> since the version is echoed there, i guess we need to make the font smaller
[13:05:44] <johnbender> toddparker: I haven't pulled in a while
[13:05:51] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll do a deploy
[13:05:55] <toddparker> sweet
[13:05:59] <toddparker> i just made a change
[13:06:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/igjOOw
[13:06:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Made version flag smaller to fit longer version names - toddparker
[13:06:28] <toddparker> anyone have any final docs changes before we're 100% on alpha?
[13:06:51] <johnbender> toddparker: deployed, I'll be back in a bit
[13:06:57] <toddparker> uGoMobi: my last change makes the text smaller, but it's still a *little* messed up
[13:07:03] <toddparker> but i can't go smaller
[13:07:11] <toddparker> thanks johnbender
[13:07:27] <johnbender> toddparker: well it will be in a sec
[13:07:29] <johnbender> its uploading
[13:07:38] <toddparker> heh. i'll stop reloading
[13:07:48] <johnbender> bbl
[13:07:50] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I was breaking up the popup example pages
[13:08:18] <uGoMobi> splitting up? well, you know what I mean ;-)
[13:08:33] <toddparker> uGoMobi: keep going
[13:08:48] <toddparker> johnbender may be able to re-deploy later if we think it's worth it
[13:09:01] <toddparker> if not, it can be an improvement for beta or rc
[13:09:13] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:09:21] <toddparker> johnbender: does the deploy re-do the CSS, JS and ZIP?
[13:09:26] <agcolom> toddparker: the banner doesn't work on iPhone site screen
[13:11:04] <agcolom> picture coming...
[13:13:06] <agcolom> toddparker: http://cl.ly/image/3p422g3H3J0h
[13:40:42] <toddparker> agcolom: i see
[13:42:38] <MauriceG> toddparker: How about using "&#945;" (Alpha sign) instead of the word Alpha?
[13:43:03] <agcolom> toddparker: also happends on the iPad
[13:47:01] <agcolom> toddparker: not 100% sure about this but removing the top and changing width to 60px; seems to work...
[13:47:32] <agcolom> (removing top: 0.75em;)
[13:47:53] <agcolom> in the .jqm-version
[13:48:12] <toddparker> lemme look
[13:50:46] <toddparker> so agcolom
[13:50:50] <toddparker> i shut this window
[13:50:55] <toddparker> what fix did you suggest
[13:52:44] <agcolom> toddparker: remove top: 0.75em; and changing width to 60px;
[13:55:57] <toddparker> Not quite, but I think I've got it
[13:56:03] <agcolom> a
[13:56:08] <agcolom> oh good!
[13:56:09] <toddparker> hard to test
[13:56:21] <toddparker> i needed to grant he version text, disable the js update
[13:56:31] <gnarf> tbenzige: did you get into the server btw via ssh?  danheberden opened an issue for me to add you as a user, and I wanted to make sure we got that figured out before I close it
[13:56:46] <agcolom> yes! that's the main problem!
[13:58:12] <agcolom> toddparker: do we need the . in .1?
[13:58:22] <agcolom> and do we need the .1 at all?
[13:58:26] <toddparker> that is populated by the tag
[13:58:32] <toddparker> so we don't have control really
[13:58:46] <toddparker> otherwise, i'd nix the .1
[13:58:48] <agcolom> of course! sorry!
[13:59:11] <toddparker> uGoMobi: are you close to done with those panel demos?
[13:59:15] <toddparker> be cool to get 'em in
[13:59:18] <agcolom> but we could add a js rule for it maybe ?
[13:59:48] <agcolom> gseguin did that for the last version (when we went 1.1.1 I think).
[14:00:22] <toddparker> he did? fancy.
[14:00:30] <toddparker> i just made it fit more text
[14:00:54] <uGoMobi> toddparker: no not yet
[14:01:04] <toddparker> odd my commit didn't pop up here
[14:01:07] <toddparker> ok uGoMobi
[14:01:16] <agcolom> toddparker: cool!
[14:01:38] <agcolom> toddparker: I've had a few commits not coming up here in the past....
[14:03:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/lUBTmg
[14:03:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Updated version flag styles to fit longer names - toddparker
[14:10:08] <agcolom> toddparker: will the updated version get uploaded automatically?
[14:17:10] <MauriceG> toddparker:  with your last commit you've added the styles for the version.png again (removed today)
[14:30:13] <johnbender> agcolom: toddparker: the popup docs nested menu appears to have links that don't go anywhere
[14:31:05] <toddparker> good catch johnbender
[14:31:07] <toddparker> i'll fix
[14:31:40] <toddparker> they point to index.html
[14:31:46] <toddparker> which is a no op?
[14:31:49] <uGoMobi> toddparker: can you revert your last commit?
[14:31:52] <toddparker> since we're on index
[14:31:58] <toddparker> err, yeah
[14:32:03] <toddparker> what's up uGoMobi
[14:32:35] <uGoMobi> toddparker: that commit reverted a couple of changes in the docs css that we did last week
[14:32:38] <uGoMobi> and today
[14:32:42] <toddparker> really?
[14:32:51] <MauriceG> qrx ...
[14:32:54] <toddparker> wonder why
[14:32:55] <uGoMobi> yeah, the fix for ui-content in popups
[14:33:21] <toddparker> huh
[14:33:23] <toddparker> reverted
[14:33:50] <toddparker> seem ok?

[14:33:59] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by toddparker (36m, 47s ago): Updated version flag styles to fit longer names
[14:34:20] <johnbender> toddparker: if they point to the relavtive index.html yes
[14:34:43] <toddparker> bizzarre uGoMobi
[14:34:48] <toddparker> i was up to date
[14:35:02] <toddparker> johnbender: i can have them go somewhere
[14:35:25] <johnbender> toddparker: kewl
[14:35:37] <johnbender> toddparker: maybe a dialog?
[14:35:44] <johnbender> toddparker: that seems like the last awkward
[14:35:49] <tbenzige> gnarf: ping
[14:37:49] <gnarf> tbenzige: pong
[14:39:00] <toddparker> ok, i'll link it to the dialog page - it's a delete confirm, but whatever
[14:39:45] <toddparker> ok uGoMobi
[14:39:52] <toddparker> should i re-try that change?
[14:40:39] <uGoMobi> toddparker: after revert, yes
[14:42:26] <toddparker> actually, i just tested my fix with a range of content lengths and it's not a good fix
[14:42:59] <uGoMobi> toddparker: hmm :(
[14:43:20] <toddparker> shorter names got wonky
[14:43:22] <uGoMobi> I think we have to skip alpha and do final now
[14:43:30] <toddparker> ok :)
[14:43:31] <uGoMobi> :D
[14:47:01] <agcolom> toddparker: can't we just make the banner longer?
[14:48:03] <agcolom> like make width: 90px;
[14:48:37] <toddparker> ok, fixed
[14:48:47] <toddparker> i had to make it longer and adjust the offsets a bit
[14:48:53] <toddparker> should be good now

[14:57:09] <uGoMobi> toddparker: actually it was more like I got a conflict with git
[15:07:13] <agcolom> end of the day here... goodnight all...
[15:09:31] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[15:09:40] <gnarf> tbenzige: great, thanks!
[15:13:34] <agcolom> goodnight Jasper!
[15:14:18] <toddparker> goodnight uGoMobi
[15:14:37] <uGoMobi> it's Anne who is going to bed :)
[15:15:18] <uGoMobi> I am still fighting with panels
[15:15:36] <toddparker> heh, sorry
[15:15:53] <toddparker> my irc client mixes people's message into other's names
[15:15:56] <toddparker> it's a mess
[15:16:35] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I am looking for another solution because of the same bug in core that messed up popup position
[15:17:01] <toddparker> uGoMobi: are you almost there with those demos or should we wait and add these later?
[15:17:19] <toddparker> solution to/
[15:17:44] <uGoMobi> right now they don't work as they should
[15:21:22] <uGoMobi> toddparker: fixing the vertical panel is easiest... we could go for one panel example
[15:21:27] <uGoMobi> add another later
[15:26:51] <toddparker> uGoMobi: if one works now, lets add that and add more later
[15:49:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 6 new commits to master: http://git.io/ph2ElQ
[15:49:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (popup): replaced prop() by attr() in text as well. - Jasper de Groot
[15:49:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs: removed iframe seamless styling for browsers that don't support this HTML5 attribute. It doesn't fix the border issue. Only way to do this is setting frameborder 0 which doesn't validate. - Jasper de Groot
[15:49:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (popup): center the marker on the map example. - Jasper de Groot
[15:52:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/XzMiyA
[15:52:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (popup): update text panel example. - Jasper de Groot
[15:56:57] <uGoMobi> toddparker: the panel example is still not great... I should add some code that triggers repositioning on scroll
[15:58:20] <toddparker> lemme look
[15:59:54] <toddparker> i see
[16:00:03] <toddparker> still looks nice
[16:00:20] <uGoMobi> the popup container is never bigger than the screen size
[16:00:44] <toddparker> so if you scroll, you see the top of the panel
[16:00:54] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes
[16:01:35] <uGoMobi> position fixed results in other issues (transition)
[16:01:51] <toddparker> i wonder if you can make it look intentional
[16:01:52] <uGoMobi> so the only solution is to reposition on scroll
[16:02:03] <toddparker> add a top/bottom border
[16:02:30] <uGoMobi> that's a good idea
[16:04:32] <uGoMobi> toddparker: you see that code block with markup... hard to read :(
[16:04:55] <uGoMobi> something we have to try to look into before final
[16:05:55] <uGoMobi> toddparker: are you ok with that controlgroup menu at the top of the example pages?
[16:06:14] <toddparker> i'm going to add deep links to each adv. demo page from index
[16:06:27] <uGoMobi> ok
[16:06:36] <toddparker> controlgroup menu ?
[16:06:55] <uGoMobi> the horizontal menu at the top of the example pages
[16:08:04] <toddparker> I see
[16:08:08] <toddparker> it's ok
[16:08:15] <uGoMobi> if you are going to add deep links we can remove it
[16:08:18] <toddparker> tho i wonder if we need it
[16:08:25] <toddparker> yeah, i'll do that
[16:08:26] <uGoMobi> I am not really fan of it
[16:08:43] <uGoMobi> a back button maybe?
[16:18:33] <toddparker> working on the iframe page now

[16:34:51] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll start one now
[16:35:25] <uGoMobi> toddparker: thanks, I am not really satisfied though
[16:37:19] <toddparker> uGoMobi - with those changes?
[16:37:26] <toddparker> it's a stop gap
[16:37:32] <toddparker> but if you have other ideas
[16:37:38] <toddparker> go for it
[16:38:03] <uGoMobi> toddparker: sorry, I didn't mean the changes you just meant.... just in general
[16:38:36] <uGoMobi> but that leaves room for improvement for 1.2 final :)
[16:39:33] <toddparker> the docs need an overhaul for sure
[16:39:54] <toddparker> once agcolom finishes with the xml stuff, we can pull that in and re-do the design and IA
[16:40:00] <toddparker> heading home
[16:40:03] <uGoMobi> blue buttons are much better BTW
[16:40:04] <toddparker> blog is ready
