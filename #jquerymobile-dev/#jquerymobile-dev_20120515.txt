[08:04:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Anne, are you here?
[09:12:44] <gseguin> kborchers: the test I ran was with master
[09:12:56] <gseguin> kborchers: I don't know about 1.1
[09:13:08] <gseguin> kborchers: not sure we will add support for 1.7.2 in 1.1.1
[09:13:33] <gseguin> unless it's really simple
[09:14:45] <kborchers> gseguin: oh, i see. ok thanks. that helps.
[09:32:33] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: 1.1 doesn't work with 1.7.2?
[09:38:55] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: I did not say that
[09:39:19] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: sorry, I inferred it from your statement about adding support for it in 1.1.1
[09:39:35] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: we don't test 1.1 against 1.7.2
[09:39:57] <gseguin> it may very well work but we don't test it
[09:40:00] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: do you forsee any reason it would be an issue?
[09:40:35] <gseguin> I was telling kborchers that I did a test run last night of master against 1.7.2 and 2 tests failed
[09:40:46] <ryanneufeld> ah
[09:40:52] <gseguin> so 1.1.1 could have the same problems
[09:41:16] <ryanneufeld> ah, okay.... sorry go bother, we're doing a push to production of 1.1 today
[09:41:29] <gseguin> as we get closer to the release we will fix these and if the fixes are easy and portable to 1.1.1 I don't see a reason not to port them
[09:41:29] <ryanneufeld> I'll just make sure it's using 1.7.1
[09:42:09] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: no worries, yes 1.7.1 is the official supported version
[09:42:28] <ryanneufeld> Great, that's the one we're launching with.... Whew...
[09:42:39] <ryanneufeld> (I just found out that I'm the release chump today)
[09:42:41] <ryanneufeld> *champ
[09:42:46] <ryanneufeld> lol
[09:43:01] <gseguin> :)
[09:44:07] <kborchers> gseguin: ryanneufeld yeah, same boat here. we are releasing some things soon and one group wanted 1.7.2 because latest/greatest/etc. but i was like, well, everything seems to work but not officially supported. thus all of the questions. we're going with 1.7.1 as well now :)
[09:44:45] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, I typically push back on at least on dot release before we switch
[09:45:01] <ryanneufeld> especially with a 1.x.0 cause not enough people test the RC
[10:33:03] <johnbender> haters gonna hate!

[10:35:18] <johnbender> this is why I don't buy apple products

[10:35:41] * johnbender laughs maniacally
[10:35:49] <johnbender> scottjehl: YAH BUDDY

[10:37:50] <Wilto> johnbender: Oh, that’s a keeper.

[10:41:39] <Wilto> gseguin: Hixie “fixed” responsive images.
[10:41:55] <johnbender> Wilto: I say "yah buddy" all the time
[10:41:59] <johnbender> I lived in jersey for 2 years
[10:42:01] <johnbender> it counts
[10:42:14] <johnbender> I also really enjoy that show
[10:42:20] <johnbender> its a guilty pleasure for my wife and I
[10:42:46] <johnbender> Wilto: google images for Paully D animated gif has some good ones
[10:42:49] <gseguin> Wilto: catching up with that twitter thread
[10:43:12] <johnbender> gseguin: it looks like the switch to grunt went over fairly smooth save for that load order thing
[10:43:19] <johnbender> which was exceptionally stupid on my part
[10:43:49] <johnbender> it certainly speed things up :D
[10:43:54] <gseguin> johnbender: well that's good and it looks like the build is lightning fast now
[10:44:06] <johnbender> yassir
[10:44:15] <johnbender> not surprising
[10:44:23] <johnbender> java spinup time/shelling out
[10:44:44] <johnbender> it will certainly make monkeying with the build faster
[10:46:47] <johnbender> gseguin: I will say though that the image copy just about destroyed my sould
[10:46:50] <johnbender> *soul
[10:47:04] <gseguin> heh
[10:47:05] <gseguin> :)
[10:47:23] <johnbender> gseguin: it's not likely I'll take the conversion much further per our discussion
[10:47:30] <johnbender> I'm going to call that one good for now
[10:47:40] <gseguin> ok

[12:59:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I had a thought today (it sometimes happens): We don't need to have any kind of complex hash manipulation system in order to support inside-the-page navigation. We can go with the lowly dialogHashKey, but put a mechanism in place that adds it when the first inside-the-page navigation event happens, and removes it when the last one is undone.
[12:59:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Then, the actual navigation is completely contained inside that mechanism.
[12:59:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm doing that currently with popups, and I've just changed the code to go from mutually exclusive to stacking.
[13:01:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, I have an action queue which is normally empty, and I push actions onto the queue. As soon as I start processing the first one, I add the dialogHashKey. I store the results of each action in an array ( currently the array of open popups ).
[13:01:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Then, when that array has exactly one element and my current action says "close" I go window.history.back().
[13:03:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, to add more kinds of inside-the-page navigation, we need only define additional types of actions, action queue insertion/removal policies for those actions (can actionA skip ahead of actionB), and some place to store the result of those actions.
[13:04:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and we need to define what it means that there is only one thing left to do, so that we do that via window.history.back().
[13:04:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... or rather, only one thing left to undo.
[13:14:06] <gseguin> johnbender: done, commented
[13:14:18] <johnbender> johnbender: on?
[13:14:36] <gseguin> that change to jquery,tag,inserter
[13:15:25] <johnbender> gseguin: when I ran the listview test it didn't default the version value
[13:15:30] <johnbender> looking
[13:15:47] <gseguin> hmm, weird
[13:16:11] <johnbender> gseguin: looking at the code seems to suggest that if the version isn't specified it will remain an empty string in the default of the case statment
[13:16:24] <johnbender> but that's just eyeballing
[13:17:18] <gseguin> oh I see!
[13:17:19] <gseguin> it
[13:17:34] <gseguin> s because I added default: in the switch
[13:17:44] <gseguin> darn
[13:18:10] <gseguin> then I would move that switch into the if (result)
[13:19:15] <gseguin> johnbender: want me to do it?
[13:19:58] <johnbender> gseguin: sure
[13:20:06] <johnbender> I assume you're going to alter the default instead
[13:20:07] <johnbender> not a big deal

[13:51:53] <agcolom> Hi Everyone, just back from Mozilla ...
[13:52:41] <agcolom> Tested JQM on a Nexus running boot2gecko and it worked really well
[13:52:54] <agcolom> (viewed the docs)
[13:52:55] <johnbender> nice
[13:53:23] <agcolom> It was Brad from Mozilla (from Boston) who let me play with his phone ;-)
[13:54:01] <agcolom> He was interested in the way we do testing... but couldn't help him...
[13:54:24] <agcolom> I got the impression he'd be interested in running unit tests for us...
[13:55:06] <johnbender> agcolom: that would be all kinds of awesome
[13:55:15] <johnbender> if you have contact with him maybe cc me on it
[13:55:58] <agcolom> Sure, I mentioned your name and said you were the person to contact... I'll get his email to you.
[13:56:17] <agcolom> he knows Scott
[13:56:23] <johnbender> ahh cool
[13:58:09] <agcolom> I haven't got his email, but I'll ask Christian for it.
[13:58:43] <agcolom> gseguin, I'm here ;-) sorry again for my git problems....
[13:59:14] <gseguin> no worries agcolom
[13:59:59] <gseguin> did you reset?
[14:00:38] <agcolom> yes, I did git reset HEAD docs/api/events.html
[14:01:03] <agcolom> Unstaged changes after reset:
[14:01:03] <agcolom> M	docs/api/events.html
[14:01:38] <gseguin> good now just checkout -- that file and you're good to go
[14:01:56] <agcolom> I tried...
[14:02:31] <agcolom> yes, sorry, I did and then I wasn't sure what to so, so did a git checkout master and it's not happy
[14:02:40] <johnbender> gseguin: is the change in 1.7.1 that `delegate` binding come after? or before? regular bindings
[14:04:48] <gseguin> hmm... man! I'm having a Dory moment
[14:05:18] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: ^
[14:05:53] <DaveMethvin> gseguin: can you summarize?
[14:06:22] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: the change in 1.7.1 that `delegate` binding come after? or before? regular bindings
[14:06:41] <DaveMethvin> delegates come before so they can stop prop before it gets to that level
[14:06:58] <gseguin> thank you!

[14:43:28] <agcolom> Aborting
[14:44:48] <gseguin> hmm
[14:45:58] <gseguin> and you don't care about that file, correct ?
[14:46:07] <johnbender> you have new files that aren't tracked by git that would be blasted by checkign out master
[14:46:27] <johnbender> oops
[14:46:28] <johnbender> nevermind
[14:46:31] <agcolom> yes, I think there was a change to event'html
[14:46:39] <gseguin> agcolom: git reflog -10
[14:47:05] <johnbender> gseguin: I think we have another ordering problem wrt to 1.6.4

[14:47:26] <johnbender> hmm
[14:47:43] <johnbender> I don't think you can cherry pick a merge without specifying the parent commit eh?
[14:47:51] <johnbender> maybe I'm wrong
[14:48:03] <gseguin> you can if it's not a merge commit
[14:48:16] <johnbender> good to know
[14:49:10] <gseguin> agcolom: the top most cherry pick is the one you don't want, right?
[14:50:00] <agcolom> the last one I don't want is 34bb3be
[14:50:56] <gseguin> agcolom: git reset HEAD@{4}
[14:51:01] <gseguin> right johnbender ?
[14:51:11] <agcolom> ok waiting to be sure
[14:52:05] <johnbender> if she wants to undo the merge yes
[14:52:35] <agcolom> It's the one that caused a conflict
[14:52:46] <gseguin> yup she hasn't pushed and we're struggling to undo that cherry pick
[14:53:01] <agcolom> because the text MauriceG moved was not in 1.1-stable
[14:53:10] <johnbender> gseguin: yah we definitely have a load order problem
[14:53:45] <johnbender> /tests/unit/page-sections/?jquery=1.6.4
[14:53:47] <johnbender> fails
[14:53:52] <johnbender> /tests/unit/page-sections/?jquery=1.7.1
[14:53:53] <johnbender> passes
[14:54:02] <agcolom> master is all ok, it's just 1.1-stable
[14:54:08] <gseguin> johnbender: hah hah, interesting that could be a reason for the weird output of the builder
[14:54:20] <gseguin> agcolom: do that reset
[14:54:33] <johnbender> gseguin: if you dump a console log into the top of page.sections.js
[14:54:42] <agcolom> Unstaged changes after reset:
[14:54:42] <agcolom> M	docs/api/events.html
[14:54:42] <agcolom> M	docs/pages/page-anatomy.html
[14:54:44] <gseguin> agcolom: that will get you in the state you were in before you cherry-picked
[14:54:45] <johnbender> and into the binding at the bottom of buttonMarkup.js
[14:54:53] <gseguin> now just git checkout -- .
[14:54:54] <johnbender> and switch the versions
[14:54:58] <johnbender> you can see the reversal
[14:55:20] <agcolom> git checkout -- . (with the .?)
[14:55:28] <gseguin> yeah with the dot
[14:55:36] <agcolom> done
[14:56:03] <gseguin> now you can push to upstream if you have pending commits
[14:56:30] <agcolom> Can I check first?
[14:56:39] <agcolom> if I do have commits?
[14:56:42] <gseguin> sure
[14:56:54] <gseguin> git fetch upstream
[14:57:12] <agcolom> but am i not on 1.1-stable?
[14:57:21] <gseguin> you are
[14:57:26] <gseguin> (or should be)
[14:57:34] <agcolom> still ok to do git fetch upstream?
[14:57:51] <agcolom> (well yes I guess to get the correct one)
[14:58:31] <agcolom>    08719a7..6ce5ecb  1.1-stable -> upstream/1.1-stable
[14:58:31] <agcolom>    34bb3be..6907444  master     -> upstream/master
[14:58:42] <gseguin> yeah fetch won't modify your workspace
[14:58:53] <gseguin> that's why you should use fetch and not pull
[14:59:03] <agcolom> ok
[14:59:06] <gseguin> alright so now
[14:59:27] <gseguin> git log --oneline 1.1-stable ^upstream/1.1-stable
[14:59:57] <johnbender> gseguin: this also alerted me to the fact that the tests are only running the default
[15:00:00] <johnbender> sigh
[15:00:02] <gseguin> that tells you what's commited in your 1.1-stable which is not in upstream/1.1-stable
[15:00:08] <johnbender> I'll take care of that tomorrow
[15:00:20] <gseguin> johnbender: darn!
[15:00:28] <johnbender> yah that could be ugly
[15:00:50] <agcolom> ok
[15:01:12] <gseguin> agcolom: so ? output?
[15:01:47] <agcolom> no output
[15:02:03] <gseguin> you're good then nothing to push on that branch
[15:02:08] <agcolom> ok
[15:02:21] <gseguin> you can do a rebase to update it if you want
[15:02:55] <agcolom> git rebase upstream/1.1-stable
[15:02:55] <agcolom> ?
[15:03:47] <gseguin> yup
[15:04:11] <agcolom> done.
[15:04:28] <gseguin> you're all set
[15:04:31] <agcolom> now can I do git checkout master and be ok
[15:04:49] <gseguin> yeah you probably have some changes to push from master
[15:05:02] <gseguin> you can checkout master
[15:05:05] <gseguin> rebase
[15:05:08] <gseguin> and push
[15:05:55] <agcolom> without fetch?
[15:06:25] <gseguin> you just fetched
[15:06:41] <gseguin> when you fetch it fetches all the branches
[15:06:47] <agcolom> ok
[15:07:22] <agcolom> so I do a git push upstream master?
[15:08:00] <gseguin> once you've rebased yes
[15:08:17] <agcolom> Everything up-to-date
[15:09:02] <gseguin> you're all set
[15:09:11] <agcolom> thank you so much!
[15:09:20] <gseguin> you're welcome
[15:09:40] <agcolom> so this means event.html is not in sync in 1.1-stable, is that right?
[15:10:05] <agcolom> and noone should touch it until this is resolved
[15:10:45] <gseguin> yeah that means that it differs from master to 1.1-stable
[15:11:09] <gseguin> and that whatever was in that commit could not be applied to the 1.1-stable
[15:11:35] <agcolom> ok, so I'm not touching that file!!!! ;-)
[15:12:11] <gseguin> heh I can take a look tomorrow
[15:12:27] <agcolom> Great, thanks, Goodnight everyone...
[15:13:14] <gseguin> see you later agcolom
