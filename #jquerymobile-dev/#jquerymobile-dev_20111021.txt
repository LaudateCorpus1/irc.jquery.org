[08:03:02] <karlsberg87> hi
[08:03:13] <Wilto> Yo yo.
[08:03:32] <karlsberg87> hello Wilto
[08:27:04] <karlsberg87> Anybody with life?
[08:28:22] <Wilto> Just barely, karlsberg87. Just barely.
[08:29:04] <karlsberg87> not good..
[09:20:35] <gseguin> Good morning all
[09:30:39] <karlsberg87> good good
[09:30:52] <karlsberg87> for ones..
[09:45:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: did you guys see my comment on the android select issue?
[09:45:14] <johnbender> that one is really bad
[09:45:33] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1077#issuecomment-2478642
[09:45:36] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1077 on jquery-mobile, reported by chenchen (8m, 5d ago): Native select Menu no event on Adroid 2.2 or above
[09:45:41] <johnbender> not the about 8 hours ago :D
[09:45:44] <johnbender> *note
[09:45:47] <Wilto> Oof.
[09:48:08] <Wilto> Want me to take a look a little later on today, or are you on it?
[09:48:35] <Wilto> …Wait.
[09:49:07] <Wilto> I broke it. How the hell did changing the positioning on the hidden status text do that..?
[09:51:01] <karlsberg87> emm
[09:51:33] <karlsberg87> im waiting here (third day) for talk with toddparker
[09:53:32] <gseguin> karlsberg87: use bot-t1 to leave a message to toddparker
[09:55:12] <eddiemonge> tbenzige is a machine
[10:02:42] <johnbender> Wilto: no idea friend but we need to sort out a nother fix for that issue if we can find one
[10:03:08] <johnbender> Wilto: I think position fixed is a bit of a crapshoot
[10:03:22] <johnbender> though that's all I can tell you really
[10:03:37] <johnbender> Wilto: and keep in mind for that bug that it ONLY happens when it's the second page
[10:03:53] <johnbender> which seems like a hint combined with position fixed
[10:04:47] <tbenzige> eddiemonge: thanks for adding all of these issues
[10:05:00] <tbenzige> eddiemonge: this is good stuff
[10:07:43] <eddiemonge> i was testing and qa'ing. i was also going through the code adding notes for myself and i guess anyone else that could fix them as well
[10:08:11] <eddiemonge> i did have one question, i didnt dig too deep inot the code yet but why you pull in the whole css file at the bottom of the index page?
[10:08:53] <kinblas> johnbender: ping
[10:08:59] <johnbender> kinblas: pong
[10:09:25] <kinblas> johnbender: ping did you guys get a reply from me on the scroll performance thread? I never received my copy so was curious if the mail server dropped it or not.
[10:09:38] <johnbender> I didn't see it
[10:11:48] <eddiemonge> me neither
[10:12:11] <Wilto> johnbender: Never a dull moment, is there?
[10:12:21] <Wilto> johnbender: I’ll get that sorted today.
[10:12:26] <Wilto> Just gotta wrap up a few things first.
[10:14:39] <kinblas> johnbender: well I just sent a 2nd one, can you let me know if you received it?
[10:14:44] <johnbender> Wilto: thanks for taking a look, I'm focusing on the winphone 7 bug
[10:14:56] <Wilto> johnbender: Godspeed, sir.
[10:15:03] * kinblas is focused on being unfocused
[10:15:36] <gseguin> kinblas: I received it
[10:15:51] <kinblas> gseguin: which one? the 1st or 2nd?
[10:16:03] <kinblas> something's flaky on my end cause I'm still not seeing squat
[10:16:14] <gseguin> kinblas: the 2nd one
[10:16:28] <eddiemonge> the one right now
[10:16:42] <kinblas> gseguin: hmmm ok so the 1st one never made it then?
[10:16:44] <kinblas> grrr
[10:16:53] <gseguin> kinblas: nope
[10:29:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] jblas pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/eOy9ZQ
[10:29:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixed relative path references added from previous checkin. - jblas@adobe.com
[10:33:13] <Wilto> Hey kinblas, thanks for looking into that scrolling/performance stuff.
[10:33:25] <tbenzige> eddiemonge: the new structure.css and theme.css need to be listed on the index page of code.jquery.com
[10:34:07] <kinblas> Wilto: no problemo
[10:34:20] <kinblas> Wilto: it's one of the main reasons I hear folks saying
[10:34:25] <kinblas> I'm going back to jQTouch
[10:34:27] <kinblas> so it's annoying
[10:34:47] <eddiemonge> tbenzige: yeah i know. a lot of things need to be on there, including a dynamic list generation. its on my todo
[10:34:57] <eddiemonge> RC2 needs to be on there too
[10:34:57] <kinblas> grr that 400 list item page doesn't load on an iPod Touch
[10:35:14] <Wilto> The idea of swapping border-radius for images makes me uneasy, ain’t gonna lie. I’m sure we’ve got other places we can make up the difference.
[10:35:22] <Wilto> kinblas: At all?
[10:35:33] <kinblas> yeah it's blank ... probably a memory thing
[10:35:39] <Wilto> Hm.
[10:35:41] * kinblas tries iPad
[10:35:57] <kinblas> Wilto: I'm hoping we don't have any CSS placing transforms on each list item
[10:38:01] <Wilto> I used my patented Race Condition Prevention Method™ of putting dozens of random setTimeouts throughout the JS. RELATED????
[10:38:19] <Wilto> (Please note that I did not do that.)
[11:03:40] <johnbender> RAWR I've isolated the windows phone 7 issue
[11:03:42] <johnbender> well
[11:03:59] <johnbender> at least isolated it enough to figure out wtf is going on hopefully
[11:04:09] <Wilto> What’s the rumpus?
[11:04:38] <johnbender> Wilto: I think it's probably a combination of things
[11:05:02] <johnbender> removing opacity: 0; from the select css fixes the problem
[11:05:08] <johnbender> obviously that's not going to help much
[11:05:18] <johnbender> but I think there's some interaction with  the ui-btn-active
[11:05:27] <johnbender> if I prevent that class from being added in the js
[11:05:28] <johnbender> all is well
[11:05:38] <Wilto> …That’s strange.
[11:05:42] <johnbender> yes
[11:05:43] <johnbender> yes it is
[11:05:51] <Wilto> The opacity thing I could kind of see, since that’s weird to begin with.
[11:06:08] <johnbender> yep that was the first thing that Todd suggested and it makes sense
[11:06:10] <Wilto> But the ui-btn-active thing is pretty baffling.
[11:06:14] <johnbender> indeed
[11:06:17] <johnbender> we will see!
[11:06:39] <Wilto> Keep on fightin’ the good fight, man.
[11:12:16] <karlsberg87> Wilto: johnbender
[11:12:32] <Wilto> ‘Sup?
[11:12:36] <karlsberg87> what i need edit for increase the buttons icons size?
[11:13:01] <karlsberg87> webkit scaling method dont resolve my images problem
[11:13:15] <karlsberg87> and i want use only css media queries
[11:13:29] <karlsberg87> then in high density screens i need increase the fonts and icons
[11:13:35] <karlsberg87> really, all ui elements
[11:19:39] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #165: STILL FAILING in 11 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/165/
[11:19:39] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jblas: Fixed relative path references added from previous checkin.
[11:29:44] <kinblas> johnbender: so is the problem that events are going through opacity 0 elements?
[11:29:55] <johnbender> kinblas: it's not clear what the problem is just yet
[11:29:59] <kinblas> johnbender: is this IE?
[11:30:04] <kinblas> cause that's a known problem I think
[11:30:12] <kinblas> the trick is to use opacity 0.01 or something like that
[11:30:22] <kinblas> so it's not totally transparent, but transparent *enoughz8
[11:30:24] <johnbender> kinblas: interesting let me try that
[11:30:26] <kinblas> enough*
[11:30:38] <johnbender> kinblas: I think there's more to it
[11:30:41] <johnbender> kinblas: but let me try that
[11:41:29] <Wilto> I thought I added that at some stage, kinblas.
[12:24:32] <toddmparker_> karlsberg87: what can i do for you?
[12:25:55] <Wilto> How goes, Todd?
[12:26:53] <toddmparker_> hey Wilto
[12:27:03] <toddmparker_> if you mess with the seelct stuff, you need to test like crazy
[12:27:17] <toddmparker_> i know opera mini/mobile was being a pain with that
[12:27:32] <toddmparker_> it was all carefully calibrated, but a house of cards
[12:28:18] <toddmparker_> so i'd prefer to figure out what commit broken android 2.2 then see if we can approach that fix differently so as to leave selects unchanged
[12:28:22] <toddmparker_> if possible
[12:28:22] <Wilto> Yeah, true—Bender’s looking into it, but I’ll be sure to volunteer my services when it comes time to check it on every-damn-thing.
[12:28:32] <toddmparker_> cool
[12:28:46] <toddmparker_> thanks johnbender
[12:28:47] <Wilto> Oh, wait, no—that’s my thing then.
[12:28:52] <toddmparker_> heh
[12:28:54] <toddmparker_> ok
[12:29:24] <toddmparker_> so definitely try and leave slecet unchanged b/c i know whatever you do will break elsewhere
[12:29:34] <Wilto> We’ve got the specific commit: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/be7f74262b2c32f1d30d0497cf5f63bdeb23dc18
[12:29:35] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1w, 3d ago): Fix for #2653 - Firefox 7.0.1 - Collapsible heading gets truncated beginning of string
[12:29:40] <toddmparker_> kinblas: you around?
[12:30:01] <toddmparker_> i'm sort of surprised at how slow that page was w/JS
[12:30:06] <toddmparker_> list perf
[12:30:39] <toddmparker_> i'd rather go without certain features (swipe events, vclick) to have things be fast
[12:31:10] <toddmparker_> seems like w/o CSS you could have a page with like 2,000 list items
[12:31:21] <toddmparker_> add CSS and maybe 1,000
[12:31:28] <toddmparker_> add js and it gets crappy at like 50
[12:32:36] <toddmparker_> oh hey Wilto - i was only suggesting that we swap out the border-radius on the container behind the icons with a circle image (add it to the 4 sprites)
[12:32:41] <toddmparker_> not anywhere else
[12:32:56] <Wilto> Ohh, gotcha. My bad—I’d be cool with that.
[12:33:15] <toddmparker_> that "disc" appears everywhere is apparently takes a lot of rendering power
[12:33:29] <toddmparker_> but maybe kin will make events so fast it won't matter
[12:33:37] <toddmparker_> it's only like a 10-15% increase in speed
[12:33:45] <toddmparker_> NO SLIDING DOOR BUTTONS
[12:33:49] <Wilto> Still, little change like sure as hell couldn’t hurt.
[12:33:54] <Wilto> like that*
[12:33:55] <toddmparker_> yeah
[12:34:06] <Wilto> ALL GIF EVERYTHING
[12:35:25] <toddmparker_> kinblas - late last night i was trying to pull out all the plugins that might hit perf but the items i pulled (events, vmouse) made some diff. but not nearly enough.
[12:35:36] <toddmparker_> i agree there must be something else in core, less obvious
[12:35:51] <toddmparker_> is there a way to profile what's happening on scroll?
[12:42:16] <kinblas> toddmparker: there might be
[12:42:27] <kinblas> toddmparker: I'm testing on iPad iOS 4.3.5
[12:42:36] <kinblas> so I'm not sure if we're seeing the same slow-downs or not
[12:47:17] <toddmparker_> do you have anyios 5 devices
[12:47:41] <toddmparker_> anyway, if you use enhanced markup, remove all js you'll see the benchmark
[12:47:56] <toddmparker_> if it's much slower, then you see what i see
[12:48:58] <toddmparker_> i removed the obvious stuff including all events in buttonmarkup and i'm not finding a single single thing that completely changes things
[12:49:15] <toddmparker_> but maybe it's death by papercuts. lots of things slowing this down together
[12:49:28] <kinblas> yeah
[12:49:56] <kinblas> actually if I don't register the event handlers which do absolutely nothing .... things are significantly faster
[12:50:08] <toddmparker_> i've had a few people say that "performance" was their primary issue with the library but it alwasy was vague
[12:50:16] <toddmparker_> pretty sure this is a big part of that
[12:50:23] <kinblas> yeah I hear that all the time too
[12:50:25] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[12:50:38] <kinblas> but I'm using jquery bind on the document
[12:50:42] <toddmparker_> do buttons really need event handlers
[12:50:48] <kinblas> wonder if it goes away using addEventListener directly
[12:51:01] <toddmparker_> well link based buttons/lists don't except for applying active state?
[12:51:03] <kinblas> if you want to respond to clicks you do :-)
[12:51:17] <toddmparker_> i meant for navigation :)
[12:51:26] <toddmparker_> oh, but i see
[12:51:30] <toddmparker_> we hijax them
[12:51:34] <toddmparker_> yeah
[12:51:35] <kinblas> I'm still trying things ... I just found it strange that null handlers registered once on document via jquery were slowing things down like that
[12:51:49] <toddmparker_> is event delegation the part making it slow?
[12:52:07] <toddmparker_> would inline handlers be faster (if gross?)
[12:52:19] <toddmparker_> sure this is over my head, just blubbering
[12:52:27] <kinblas> I'm not using event delegation .... just bind with handlers that do nothing
[12:52:43] <kinblas> I mean in a sense it is delegation, but the handlers are doing nothing
[12:52:43] <toddmparker_> oh, nevermind then
[12:52:49] <kinblas> and I verified I'm only registering the handlers once
[12:52:50] <toddmparker_> right
[12:52:53] <toddmparker_> ok, i'll leave you be...
[12:53:01] <toddmparker_> off to karate, will check in later
[12:53:06] <kinblas> but the thing is that jquery is the one dispatching the event/invoking the handlers
[12:53:12] <kinblas> so it might be that code that is slowing things down
[12:53:24] <toddmparker_> did tyler figure out the api key stuff with you?
[12:53:24] <kinblas> toddmparker: heh ... go get 'em
[12:53:31] <toddmparker_> ok, going...
[12:53:32] <kinblas> not sure where we are with that
[12:53:40] <Wilto> Break a board or two for us.
[12:53:42] <kinblas> basically what we need is to do github updates on the server
[12:53:50] <kinblas> and then when that is done inject our key into that php file
[12:54:08] <kinblas> I meant do a github pull, then inject our key
[12:54:19] <kinblas> because the file on github has no key in it
[12:56:15] <karlsberg87> hello toddmparker_
[12:56:36] <karlsberg87> just come back
[12:56:40] <karlsberg87> are you here?
[12:57:36] <karlsberg87> ops :(
[13:00:06] <karlsberg87> toddparker:  i hear that you are the stylesheet comitter
[13:00:17] <karlsberg87> or maybe the first version
[13:19:05] <eddiemonge> can we define dependencies in the files themselves?
[13:26:38] <johnbender> eddiemonge: which dependencies are those?
[13:26:53] <eddiemonge> the js ones
[13:27:08] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I was looking at AMD for building a dep graph
[13:27:25] <johnbender> it's a solved problem and core is going to use that shortly as well
[13:27:42] <gseguin> yeeha!
[13:27:44] <johnbender> requirejs has a child library r.js that will help us do builts based on the defined deps
[13:27:59] <johnbender> credit to gseguin for the suggestion
[13:28:12] <gseguin> heh :)
[13:28:20] <gseguin> I'm just happy we're doing it
[13:28:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: works case we should be able to get a tree out of it
[13:28:27] <Wilto> Something I can help with, karlsberg87?
[13:28:33] <gseguin> I just AMDized our entire code base here
[13:29:03] <eddiemonge> what does that look like exactly?
[13:29:21] <johnbender> eddiemonge: http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html
[13:29:21] * gseguin retrieves @unscriptable preso
[13:29:24] <johnbender> thats a good place to start
[13:29:40] <gseguin> http://unscriptable.com/code/Using-AMD-loaders/#0
[13:32:00] <eddiemonge> thats what dojo is switching to right?
[13:32:13] <johnbender> not sure
[13:32:36] <gseguin> eddiemonge: yeah they've actually switched to that in 1.6
[13:32:50] <eddiemonge> in 1.6? you sure?
[13:33:00] <gseguin> yeah that's when they started
[13:33:15] <gseguin> jQuery core will using it in 1.7
[13:33:28] <gseguin> s/will/will be/
[13:35:13] <Wilto> This Android bug makes so much sense I can’t even believe it.
[13:35:25] <Wilto> .ui-collapsible-heading-status { position: fixed; left:-9999px; } == Broken
[13:35:38] <Wilto> .ui-collapsible-heading-status { position: fixed; top: 0; left:-9999px; } == Smooth sailing
[13:36:09] <eddiemonge> broken how?
[13:36:34] <Wilto> The issue with native selects not firing in Android 2.2/2.3.
[13:36:35] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1077
[13:36:35] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1077 on jquery-mobile, reported by chenchen (8m, 6d ago): Native select Menu no event on Adroid 2.2 or above
[13:36:39] <Wilto> It’s a weird one.
[13:37:39] <gseguin> Wilto: so just adding the top: 0 fixes it?
[13:38:05] <Wilto> Yeah… Feels a little voodoo-y. I’m rechecking everything, just in case.
[13:40:56] <kinblas> Wilto: I'm not surprised :-) I've seen weirdness like that in desktop browsers when using absolute/fixed and not specifying one of the dimensions (top/bottom, left/right)
[13:41:14] <Wilto> Yeah, likewise. It’s one of those “I wish this surprised me more” fixes.
[13:41:17] <kinblas> not specifying it leaves it up to the implementors
[13:41:24] <kinblas> of the browser
[13:41:34] <kinblas> Wilto: heh
[13:41:43] <Wilto> Which typically rub mud in their hair and run shrieking into the woods.
[13:41:52] <kinblas> heh
[13:43:19] <Wilto> Anyway, big issue, small fix—I shouldn’t be griping, really.
[13:43:32] <Wilto> Testing now, and hopefully it’ll be in by the end of the day.
[13:45:04] <johnbender> Wilto: you found a fix for the android issue?!?
[13:45:13] <Wilto> Yessir.
[13:45:18] <johnbender> bisect
[13:45:24] <johnbender> git found that bug
[13:45:33] <johnbender> oh the glory that is bisect
[13:45:47] <Wilto> Yet another reason it’s so hard to gripe when I struggle with git.
[13:45:52] <Wilto> It’s just so damned _good_.
[14:04:54] <eddiemonge> danheberden: how does that control script (supposed to) work?
[14:15:00] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/MKztsQ
[14:15:00] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #1077, somewhat mysteriously. Re-checked native selects across common devices/browsers, which seem unaffected by this change. - Mat Marquis
[14:15:33] <Wilto> THE MYSTERY FIX. Starring Wilto, co-starring that obnoxious “DROID” startup voice.
[14:15:45] <Wilto> The script is 80% cursing.
[14:18:13] <Wilto> I’m sneaking out for now, guys—I’ve got a cold kicking my ass today. If anyone should see anything weird as a result of that commit, don’t hesitate to drop me a line over the weekend.
[14:20:30] <kinblas> Wilto: hope ya feel better
[14:20:35] <kinblas> have a good weekend
[14:20:46] <Wilto> Thanks man, you too!
[14:26:20] <gseguin> Wilto: have a good weekend
[14:29:01] <eddiemonge> kinblas: why is touchstart bound to the whole document?
[14:30:06] <kinblas> eddiemonge: it's so we can properly dispatch virtual events through the dom tree *once*
[14:30:45] <kinblas> also the buttonMarkup binds mouse/click handlers at the document level anyways
[14:31:38] <eddiemonge> anyway to switch to using delegate instead of live?
[14:31:54] <kinblas> eddiemonge: we're not using live()
[14:31:56] <kinblas> it's too expensive
[14:32:01] <kinblas> we're directly binding
[14:33:05] <eddiemonge> ah ok. i havent looked at that script so i dont know
[14:35:53] <karlsberg87> Someone can explain me why JQM use absolutes font-sizes, if it can use relatives and gain +1 accesibility (Easy increasing size)
[14:37:03] <kinblas> karlsberg87: ugh you missed Wilto and toddmparker again
[14:37:22] <kinblas> karlsberg87: they are usually on between 8am-5pm EST
[14:37:23] <karlsberg87> im trying it 4 days
[14:37:33] <karlsberg87> he come 4 minuts
[14:38:00] <karlsberg87> and when i come back, he go out
[14:38:07] <karlsberg87> I dont have luck,..
[14:38:11] <karlsberg87> xD
[14:38:39] <karlsberg87> kinblas: like SOS question... you know if its possible increase the button icons?
[14:38:52] <karlsberg87> or a easy way of increase interface size?
[14:39:19] <kinblas> karlsberg87: you can always override the CSS
[14:39:40] <kinblas> I'm just not sure why they chose pixels ... I'm sure they are aware of the accessibility implications of using px versus em
[14:39:45] <kinblas> they are big on accessibility
[14:39:54] <kinblas> they == filament group
[14:49:15] <karlsberg87> kinblas:
[14:49:27] <karlsberg87> can ask you some development questions at query ?
[14:50:48] <kinblas> karlsberg87: at query?
[14:50:56] <karlsberg87> better
[14:51:09] <karlsberg87> private message
[14:51:17] <kinblas> oh sure
[14:51:17] <karlsberg87> is 'query' in english no?
[14:51:26] <kinblas> you mean irc private chat?
[14:51:32] <karlsberg87> of course
[15:06:45] <karlsberg87> maybe /join #phonegap
[15:06:47] <karlsberg87> ups
[15:07:00] <karlsberg87> lol
[15:07:29] <eddiemonge> is there any difference between
[15:07:31] <eddiemonge> theme = $btn.attr( "data-" + $.mobile.ns + "theme" );
[15:07:34] <eddiemonge> and
[15:07:43] <eddiemonge> theme = $btn.data($.mobile.ns + "theme" );
[15:12:11] <eddiemonge> johnbender: kinblas ^^ ?
[15:13:02] <kinblas> eddiemonge: if you are going to extract via data you probably want to use jqmData() instead
[15:13:20] <kinblas> the one difference I can think of is that dynamically updated data is not reflected in the attribute
[15:13:23] <eddiemonge> is there any reason to use attr as opposed to that?
[15:13:38] <eddiemonge> so then jqmdata would be better? hows the perf diff?
[15:14:04] <kinblas> i think under the hood we are using $.data()
[15:14:09] <kinblas> as opposed to $.fn.data
[15:14:14] <kinblas> because it is faster
[15:15:13] * kinblas senses eddiemonge is doing a sweep :-)
[15:16:15] <eddiemonge> i have no idea what you are talking about ;)

[15:32:52] <gseguin> eddiemonge: in your test: http://jsperf.com/while-through-dom
[15:33:13] <gseguin> didn't you forget an extra call to your function in the first test case?
[15:33:24] <eddiemonge> oops
[15:33:26] <gseguin> I edited it into http://jsperf.com/while-through-dom/2
[15:33:36] <gseguin> and the results are exactly identical
[15:34:55] <eddiemonge> actually it should be http://jsperf.com/while-through-dom/4
[15:35:03] <eddiemonge> you need to actually call the function after each
[15:35:16] <gseguin> oops
[15:35:35] <gseguin> my bad I thought you were calling it somewhere else
[15:35:58] <gseguin> makes more sense
[15:36:02] <eddiemonge> my original test forgot to call the function in the second test

[16:04:47] <eddiemonge> ok ill redo
[16:04:57] <gseguin> eddiemonge: sorry about that
[16:05:23] <eddiemonge> are the dialog, event and init tests failing for anyone else?
[16:06:45] <johnbender> eddiemonge: dialog yes
[16:07:05] <gseguin> eddiemonge: event no
[16:07:23] <johnbender> eddiemonge: the dialog one is the failure that's bothering the CI
[16:07:28] <johnbender> init is fine for me
[16:07:36] <gseguin> same here
[16:10:23] <eddiemonge> the tests take forever to run
[16:10:44] <johnbender> eddiemonge: just run the tests local to your change and wait for the CI to run the suite
[16:10:51] <johnbender> that's what the CI is for
[16:11:46] <eddiemonge> im concerned because my master checkout has the init tests failing
[16:12:11] <johnbender> eddiemonge: which browser?
[16:12:20] <eddiemonge> chrome
[16:12:24] <eddiemonge> but its only my local
[16:12:35] <eddiemonge> new tab with jqm/tests it passes
[16:12:57] <johnbender> eddiemonge: passes for me as well
[16:13:09] <johnbender> let me fix this dialog test issue
[16:13:21] <johnbender> and then you can just push to the CI
[16:13:47] <johnbender> eddiemonge: we have state issues with our tests that will be fixed post 1.0 hopefully
[16:15:16] <eddiemonge> widget too failed
[16:15:47] <eddiemonge> let me try a clean copy to make sure my working repo isnt borked
[16:16:19] <eddiemonge> we really need to figure out how to get the repo filesize to be smaller
[16:16:20] <johnbender> eddiemonge: that one fails for me too
[16:16:22] <johnbender> I just added that test
[16:16:34] <johnbender> and its not passing now for some reason
