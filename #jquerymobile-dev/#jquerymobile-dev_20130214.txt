[03:42:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that error I was talking about was because of a missing data- attribute so please ignore 
[03:43:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can we change the h2widget so it only selects h2 elements that are direct child of div.jqm-content to avoid the issues with h2's  in listviews?

[04:52:55] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi: yeah thats no problem to filter them
[04:53:17] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:03:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will disable ajax nav in the head of each file and remove superfluous data-ajax false attributes from links
[05:03:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool
[05:04:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: why dont you disable ajax in _assets/js/ 
[05:04:09] <arschmitz> then it will be on every page
[05:04:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: have to disable before we load jquery.mobile.js
[05:04:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: assets is before jqm
[05:04:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh wait
[05:05:01] <uGoMobi> right
[05:05:08] <arschmitz> :)
[05:05:08] <uGoMobi> just saw that
[05:05:36] <uGoMobi> well then it goes in there of course :)
[05:05:39] <arschmitz> then you can just enable it where needed
[05:05:59] <uGoMobi> yup
[05:06:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toddmparker: and i had also discussed we should set data-enhance="false" on the global nav panel
[05:06:49] <arschmitz> and anywhere we enable ajax nav also set ignorecontentenabled="true"
[05:10:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: why do we need to set it on the global nav container?
[05:11:17] <arschmitz> to ensure that when ajax is enabled on a demo that all of those links dont use ajax still
[05:11:39] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:11:41] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[05:12:16] <uGoMobi> and that will only work if $.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled is set to "true"... I get it
[05:12:22] <arschmitz> yup
[05:13:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im confused where are you seeing the h2's in listviews being found by h2widget? i dont see it here http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/listviews/
[05:13:34] <arschmitz> never mind 
[05:13:39] <arschmitz> ignore me i see it there for sure
[05:13:41] <arschmitz> lol
[05:13:45] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:14:22] <uGoMobi> collapsibles also had this issue but I think toddmparker___ changed them to use h3 instead
[05:14:30] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:15:52] <arschmitz> so strange i dont see it local though
[05:17:20] <uGoMobi> I do see them local
[05:17:29] <arschmitz> weird
[05:17:43] <arschmitz> guess it dosent matter i dont need to see them to fix it
[05:17:46] <arschmitz> lol
[05:18:11] <arschmitz> oh huh someone changed something
[05:18:18] <arschmitz> i pulled master and now they show

[06:12:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how? where?
[06:12:59] <arschmitz> realized i forgot to add the hashupdate and history tracking to the click handeling for the section links
[06:13:36] <uGoMobi> aha
[06:13:38] <arschmitz> so i updated like johnbender told me to when we discussed a while back  and not sure if i did something wrong or what but yeah infiniti loop lol
[06:14:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: shouldn't it be data-ajax="false" instead of data-enhance="false" on the global nav container?
[06:14:37] <arschmitz> it does what i wanted lol just does it an infiniti number of times lol 
[06:14:52] <arschmitz> yes
[06:14:54] <arschmitz> sorry
[06:15:02] <uGoMobi> ok np
[06:15:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping!
[06:15:13] <arschmitz> we still want it to enhance lol
[06:15:46] <uGoMobi> yeah :)
[06:21:06] <arschmitz> oh loop thwarted lol
[06:23:18] <toddmparker> Morning
[06:23:19] <toddmparker> How's the family doing arschmitz 
[06:23:37] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker: everyone is good
[06:23:39] <toddmparker> That CDC thing is wacky
[06:23:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah for sure
[06:23:57] <arschmitz> but i guess its just standard procedure 
[06:24:05] <toddmparker> I picture a bunch of people in spacesuits holding your baby
[06:24:20] <arschmitz> lol nah just one lady and no space suits ha ha
[06:24:21] <toddmparker> Good it's not anything serious
[06:24:27] <uGoMobi> ?tell _|Nix|_: disabling AJAX in the docs global also kills SJAX in scripts and styles for view source
[06:24:32] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[06:24:46] <toddmparker> Boring. You need to improve that story
[06:24:51] <toddmparker> Hi uGoMobi 
[06:24:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah they are pretty sure it was just cross contamination
[06:24:57] <toddmparker> How goes?
[06:25:34] <uGoMobi> good :)
[06:25:49] <uGoMobi> how's Boston? still lot of snow?

[06:27:14] <toddmparker> Maybe a 18" on the ground
[06:27:22] <toddmparker> Sunny and warm
[06:27:23] <arschmitz> ^^ that commit adds full history and url updates too
[06:27:29] <uGoMobi> ah ok, better
[06:27:39] <uGoMobi> nice arschmitz 
[06:27:58] <toddmparker> Cool
[06:28:19] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: That panel demo you added yesterday is slick
[06:28:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: thanks
[06:28:41] <toddmparker> New demos site is so much better
[06:28:56] <uGoMobi> it sure is
[06:29:13] <arschmitz> yeah i think the new demos site adds a lot!
[06:29:21] <uGoMobi> adding a few more demos today
[06:29:39] <toddmparker> Sweet
[06:29:45] <uGoMobi> dynamically inject items in controlgroup, collapsible expand/collapse events, etc
[06:30:13] <toddmparker> arschmitz: We should comment out any faqs not yet built
[06:30:23] <toddmparker> I can do that if you want
[06:30:40] <arschmitz> yeah i think its basicly everything after pages
[06:30:50] <toddmparker> Ugomobi sounds great
[06:30:58] <toddmparker> Easy arschmitz 
[06:31:13] <arschmitz> yup just the whole end of the list lol
[06:31:29] <arschmitz> iv just been working down from the top in order adding them
[06:31:37] <toddmparker> Nice
[06:32:02] <arschmitz> got over half of them so far so good progress
[06:32:53] <toddmparker> Yeah!
[06:33:09] <toddmparker> arschmitz: In addition to those 2 h2 issues
[06:33:22] <toddmparker> Go to http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/collapsibles/
[06:33:32] <toddmparker> Click the last jump to option
[06:33:51] <toddmparker> On iOS it either reloads the page or jumps but doesn't close
[06:34:15] <arschmitz> something is weird there ill have to look the panel does not close there
[06:34:16] <toddmparker> Maybe we should use a - or _ delimiter for spaces?
[06:34:58] <toddmparker> Seems to happen with longer names 
[06:35:22] <arschmitz> yup weird ill have to look at it
[06:36:34] <arschmitz> i see the problem ill fix it
[06:36:49] <toddmparker> K
[06:36:57] <toddmparker> Train is coming, brb
[06:43:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it is even worse.. not only SJAX in scripts and styles doesn't work, view source in general doesn't work if disable AJAX

[06:45:31] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ^^ fixed i forgot the global flag on regex so it was only replacing first instance 
[06:46:03] <arschmitz> still might not be a bad idea to add a dilimiter though 
[06:46:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think we can nix one class for the section links
[06:46:20] <uGoMobi> all links now have jqm-sections-link and jqm-top-link
[06:46:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think you mentioned the other day im fine with it 
[06:47:21] <uGoMobi> maybe change to jqm-h2widget-link
[06:48:30] <uGoMobi> or just jqm-deeplink
[06:51:03] <arschmitz> either way
[06:52:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you change it to jqm-deeplink in the h2widget, I will change the CSS

[06:55:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks
[06:56:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so disabling AJAX breaks view source :(
[06:56:12] <arschmitz> i saw your comments about that
[06:56:43] <arschmitz> though im not sure why you are using nav for viewsource?
[06:58:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ made some changes to pull in scripts and styles
[06:58:45] <uGoMobi> but I don't know how it works exactly now
[06:58:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: how are you disableing it just $.mobile.ajaxEnabled = "false" right?
[06:58:53] <uGoMobi> haven't looked at it for a while
[06:59:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[06:59:19] <arschmitz> weird ill have to look at whats going on in viewsource
[07:02:19] <arschmitz> so whats happening is the popup not opening?
[07:02:38] <toddmparker> Hmm
[07:02:50] <toddmparker> Rather have view source work locally 
[07:02:54] <toddmparker> Won't now?
[07:03:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: not an issue of local i dont think disabling ajax is breaking it some how
[07:03:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: popup doesn't open and you jump to top of page
[07:03:47] <arschmitz> yup 
[07:04:00] <arschmitz> the popup is using a hook into pagebeforechange
[07:04:17] <arschmitz> there is no pagebeforechange
[07:04:28] <arschmitz> with ajaxdisabled
[07:04:46] <uGoMobi> at other demos where we pull in scripts and styles with SJAX you get to see index page with file tree
[07:05:20] <uGoMobi> ah ok, that's explains it
[07:06:12] <arschmitz> yup
[07:06:20] <arschmitz> its fixable but i wonder if its worth it
[07:07:21] <arschmitz> because any demo that hooks into page events they will be missing

[07:20:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you saying we better don't disable AJAX  global?
[07:20:23] <arschmitz> kinda what im thinking
[07:21:30] <arschmitz> im just wondering how many demos it will mess with
[07:25:19] <toddmparker> i see
[07:25:48] <toddmparker> be nice to see if we can figure out something smoother for script/style loading for 1.4
[07:26:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: can you see if the h2widget still works with ajax disabled global?
[07:26:08] <toddmparker> this feels clumsy
[07:27:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes h2widget still works
[07:27:13] <toddmparker> wonder if we could have a convention to allow people to flag scripts and styles in the head that need to be pulled in when the page is ajax loaded. we'd need to also remove those on page hide which gets messy tho. hmmm
[07:27:30] <arschmitz> hmmm ok maybe its something else then that uses pagebeforechange for the link handling 
[07:28:10] <toddmparker> so should we plan on leaving ajax nag on and just adding data-ajax="false" to links that point to pages with custom stuff in the head?
[07:28:45] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think we should have _|Nix|_: take a look
[07:28:59] <arschmitz> because its not what i thought it was that leave link handling intact 
[07:29:10] <arschmitz> so something else is funky with view source
[07:29:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: view source does work if we set data-ajax="false" on a link
[07:30:07] <arschmitz> right i know
[07:30:17] <arschmitz> i mean with why its not working when disabled globaly
[07:30:27] <arschmitz> if the h2 widget works its not the problem i thought it was
[07:30:40] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[07:30:43] <arschmitz> because the section links should not work either if i was right

[14:56:26] <Wilto> KIN IS BACK
[14:56:47] <Wilto> NO TAKE-BACKS YOU’RE STUCK HERE NOW
[14:56:53] <kinblas> johnbender: apparently several folks have been using a plugin for jqm that I wrote that allows passing of url params through the loadPage showPage mechanism
[14:57:00] <toddmparker> RWhitbeck: aw, man
[14:57:03] <toddmparker> sorry, no
[14:57:13] <toddmparker> is that staged up or only local?
[14:57:16] <kinblas> johnbender: I've been hearing from them cause its broken in 1.3 … I'm assuming this has to do with the nav changes?
[14:57:21] <toddmparker> do i need WP installed
[14:57:27] <kinblas> wilto: heh nice try :-P
[14:57:30] <toddmparker> i was set up then got a new machine
[14:57:33] <RWhitbeck> only local since the new styles are in a branch
[14:57:36] <toddmparker> hey kinblas!!
[14:57:50] <kinblas> toddmparker:  hey todd :-)
[14:58:00] <toddmparker> RWhitbeck: could you walk me thru the process?

[15:39:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ah ok
[15:39:25] <uGoMobi> don't think I have access to that page
[15:40:20] <uGoMobi> but it can wait until monday
[15:40:38] <toddmparker> looking for the login
[15:40:39] <uGoMobi> when we push 1.3 final
[15:40:49] <toddmparker> jlembeck has is handy, he can push it
[15:40:55] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[15:41:00] <toddmparker> oh, so we can wait? 
[15:41:17] <uGoMobi> well if it's not much trouble he can already push
[15:41:19] <toddmparker> either way
[15:41:21] <toddmparker> ok
[15:42:32] <uGoMobi> thanks
[15:42:47] <jlembeck> yeah, no trouble at all over here
[15:44:13] <uGoMobi> thanks jlembeck 
[15:44:27] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: ok, i pushed it live…can you check?
[15:44:34] <uGoMobi> sure
[15:44:40] <toddmparker> it was ok up on stage.
[15:44:55] <jlembeck> I've updated stage
[15:44:58] <jlembeck> oh, nevermind then
[15:45:41] <toddmparker> oh, maybe i did that wrong
[15:45:46] <uGoMobi> works fine
[15:45:49] <toddmparker> was it up on -test and look dok
[15:46:13] <toddmparker> so you see your change here: http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/
[15:46:23] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:46:42] <toddmparker> cool
[15:46:45] <toddmparker> what's different?
[15:47:10] <uGoMobi> you can apply a color to the read only list item and the slider track now
[15:47:18] <uGoMobi> before it would bounce
[15:48:09] <toddmparker> ah, neat
[15:48:11] <toddmparker> ok
[15:48:11] <uGoMobi> or apply the color to the body instead in case of the slider track
[15:48:58] <toddmparker> nice
[15:50:34] <toddmparker> ok, heading out!
[15:51:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: good night

[16:39:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: copied demos to root
[16:39:26] <uGoMobi> busy updating all links :)
[16:39:49] <toddmparker> Nice
[16:40:08] <toddmparker> So we just bed to replace the index when we're ready
[16:40:24] <toddmparker> Hope nothing breaks!

[16:43:09] <toddmparker> That right uGoMobi?
[16:43:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I didn't push yet
[16:43:45] <uGoMobi> checking all links to the JS and CSS source files
[16:43:50] <toddmparker> Ah! Saw that other commit mag

[16:47:41] <toddmparker> All the home links need to change
[16:47:53] <toddmparker> You probably already got those 
[16:49:04] <uGoMobi> the home links in the header are relative
[16:50:06] <toddmparker> Yeah, ok now
[16:50:30] <toddmparker> Should be disable the URL bar hiding

[16:51:04] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14339fe85 15Jasper de Groot: Demos: fixed broken link to JS source file.
[16:51:47] <toddmparker> Feel like it adds glitchy mess on iOS 
[16:51:50] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/dialog/
[16:52:00] <toddmparker> There, for example
[16:52:23] <toddmparker> That a config option?
[16:52:44] <uGoMobi> don't think so
[16:52:57] <toddmparker> Yeah?
[16:53:32] <toddmparker> Feels like hack now 
[16:53:45] <uGoMobi> not sure what you mean
[16:54:12] <toddmparker> We scroll 1px to hide the URL bar
[16:54:28] <toddmparker> Which makes it hop around on transitions
[16:54:47] <toddmparker> Think iOS 6 is worse in this regard
[16:55:14] <toddmparker> Anyway, thanks for re-organizing 
[16:55:22] <toddmparker> I'll do more cleanup later
[16:59:01] <uGoMobi> I see... yeah we could look into the url bar
[16:59:18] <uGoMobi> would be nice if we could prevent it from showing up in general
[16:59:29] <uGoMobi> there is already a ticket for that
[17:00:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we now have jQuery Mobile in the header on every page, should the section title be in the header?
[17:00:51] <uGoMobi> Widgets - jQuery Mobile or just Widgets 
[17:22:19] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: We had that before but it felt redundant with the h1 below
[17:22:41] <toddmparker> I was thinking about even using a logo up there
[17:22:55] <toddmparker> Make it look more like a web site than an app
[17:23:02] <uGoMobi> true
[17:23:14] <toddmparker> It also gets crazy truncated
[17:23:20] <uGoMobi> yeah
[17:24:12] <toddmparker> I like the green top but I might play with a different header
[17:24:21] <toddmparker> What do you think would be good?
[17:24:47] <toddmparker> Trying to get people to not just use stock everything too
[17:46:33] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/z7Zqiw
[17:46:33] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 142b0d365 15Jasper de Groot: Demos: moves homepage root (temp name: stage.index.html) and added a redirect in demos folder. Fixed some broken links.
[17:47:29] <uGoMobi> pff... can't type normal commit message anymore. might be a sign I should go to bed
[17:48:50] <toddmparker> arschmitz and _|Nix|_ - if you go to a demo page like http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/autocomplete/ jump to a section, then view source, the popup is glitchy when it closes and it also scrolls you back to the section you anchored to. Any ideas?
[17:49:08] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Beautiful commit
[17:49:23] <toddmparker> Mine get terrible when I'm tired
[17:49:29] <toddmparker> Go to bed!
[17:49:30] <uGoMobi> haha
[17:49:33] <uGoMobi> yeah
[17:49:47] <toddmparker> My typing us bad enough when my brain works 
[17:49:48] <uGoMobi> so the demos homepage is now stage.index.html
[17:49:52] <toddmparker> See?
[17:50:03] <uGoMobi> :)
[17:50:17] <toddmparker> What's the full URL?
[17:50:53] <uGoMobi> it should be http://jquerymobile.com/test/stage.index.html
[17:51:33] <uGoMobi> ah that won't work
[17:52:16] <toddmparker> Maybe just have it be undex2.html or next.html
[17:53:54] <uGoMobi> but http://jquerymobile.com/test/demos/examples/ doesn't work either
[17:54:54] <uGoMobi> I think /test/ is a proxy or something
[17:55:17] <uGoMobi> so you can't just replace /docs/ with any other folder
[17:55:54] <uGoMobi> right now the demos/ folder and it's homepage has exacty the same setup as docs/

[18:15:01] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: if I remove the margin from the panels scrolling is smooth on iOS6
[18:17:34] <uGoMobi> I will think about an alternative for the header
[18:18:09] <uGoMobi> have to ask the guys who know about severs why /test/demos/.. doesn't work
[18:19:40] <uGoMobi> it works local... home links will bring you to the old homepage because though
