[08:54:46] <toddparker> good morning all
[09:00:18] <toddparker> johnbender: what should we do here - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4869#issuecomment-7899944
[09:00:30] <toddparker> removing UA detection +1
[09:11:56] <Wilto> Alright; what’d I miss?
[09:12:25] <Wilto> “IE10 no longer supports conditional comments”
[09:12:28] <Wilto> Woah.
[09:22:01] <toddparker> and un-prefixed animations
[09:23:45] <toddparker> johnbender, gseguin, uGoMobi - Unless anyone has new theories on how to fix the wild scrolling issue on WP7, I'm going to have wilto look at pulling in Gabriel's fix-4784 branch that excludes WP from the back button support on popups (back will nav you back unfortunately)
[09:24:06] <Wilto> I’m genuinely stumped.
[09:24:09] <toddparker> wilt will also take a look at the UA detection in the popup code to see how to change that to avoid hitting IE10
[09:24:27] <Wilto> Might install WURFL real quick.
[09:24:28] <gseguin> no idea/theory here
[09:24:42] <toddparker> he's also going to look at how to fix the sticky button focus glow in WP7 which is also related to history
[09:24:51] <toddparker> WURFL all the things
[09:25:05] <toddparker> gseguin: yes, it's just an ugly set of WP bugs
[09:25:10] <toddparker> uGoMobi: you around?
[09:25:54] <toddparker> once those 3 items are landed and we can do a testing pass, we'll be ready to make the final docs changes for 1.2rc
[09:26:03] <toddparker> then johnbender can do the build
[09:26:36] <toddparker> MauriceG: you around? if you have time to help me create a list of updates from alpha to now, that would be a massive help
[09:54:07] <tbenzige> gseguin: ping
[09:54:21] <gseguin> yes sir?
[09:54:33] <tbenzige> did you send me a DM on twitter?
[09:54:46] <gseguin> disregard
[09:54:49] <gseguin> been hacked
[09:55:03] <gseguin> changed my password already
[09:55:03] <tbenzige> gseguin: ok. thought so.
[09:55:15] <gseguin> it's all toddparker's fault ;)
[10:05:56] <Wilto> DAMMIT, TODDPARKER
[10:08:21] <johnbender> toddparker: johnbender can indeed do a build when you needs it
[10:09:08] <johnbender> toddparker: I need to hear back from _|Nix|_ on adding that
[10:09:14] <johnbender> for the pull request
[10:09:23] <johnbender> unless you guys know why that conditional is in there
[10:09:33] <johnbender> toddparker: otherwise the .ie isn't really broken
[10:09:42] <johnbender> because we want to treat ie10 just like any other browser
[10:09:48] <johnbender> in theory
[10:09:51] <johnbender> A grade
[10:10:17] <johnbender> toddparker: we don't use the ie check anywhere except gradeA() and in the popup
[10:12:54] <johnbender> toddparker: so it's actually not broken except for the test
[10:17:50] <Wilto> So, when we add a “close” button to popups — like the “photo” one — we’re using a back button.
[10:18:19] <Wilto> Now that WP isn’t getting the history treatment with popups, that don’t work so good.
[10:20:03] <Wilto> Sorry, poor grammar there: “don’t work so good-LY.”
[10:20:39] <Wilto> So… do we check popups for “back” buttons, and reassign them the same logic as clicking the backdrop?
[10:21:45] <Wilto> Or do we introduce a new popup-closing button, all the logic for which should likely live in popup rather than buttonMarkup?
[10:22:37] <toddparker> wilt - think so
[10:22:38] <johnbender> honest to god
[10:23:01] <Wilto> I DON’T BUY IT, BENDER
[10:23:06] <johnbender> don't we _have_ to be causing the scrolling issue?
[10:23:15] <Wilto> We are.
[10:23:17] <johnbender> did we ever figure out what it was?
[10:23:28] <Wilto> It’s the hashchange stuff.
[10:24:04] <Wilto> If we opt WP out of that — so, no back button to close popups — everything is fine. Both the scrolling and the “sticky focus styles” issues go away.
[10:25:23] <Wilto> Now… you guys know how I feel about opting specific things out of things.
[10:25:54] <uGoMobi> hi all
[10:25:57] <johnbender> Wilto: it's the hashchange stuff :(
[10:26:07] <Wilto> Yeeeah.
[10:26:10] <johnbender> hmm
[10:26:39] <johnbender> Wilto: but then we need to special case close buttons ...
[10:26:42] <uGoMobi> didn't find a solution for the WP issue yet :(
[10:26:48] <johnbender> hrm
[10:26:50] <Wilto> johnbender: I hate that the most.
[10:26:58] <johnbender> let me see if I have my windows vm
[10:27:03] <johnbender> I'm interested in taking al ook
[10:27:08] <johnbender> even if it's a waste of time
[10:27:17] <johnbender> Wilto: is this only on the phone?
[10:27:22] <johnbender> or can you reproduce in ie7
[10:27:23] <uGoMobi> that IE detection in popup JS is for opacity
[10:27:28] <Wilto> I’m not sure.
[10:27:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ^^
[10:27:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: correct
[10:27:43] <uGoMobi> so that only affects IE7/8
[10:27:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that's what we figured
[10:28:06] <uGoMobi> I think we could do that in a CSS only way
[10:28:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I think we need to leave it alone then and just change the name
[10:28:32] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'll close that pull request once I've finished testing
[10:28:38] <Wilto> We gotta get some DD_roundies up in this library, guys.
[10:29:11] <Wilto> IE7 is working great for me, actually.
[10:29:24] <Wilto> File that under “things no one has ever said before.”
[10:29:42] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:30:57] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I am here now
[10:31:18] <Wilto> —We’re IE-detecting for a style?
[10:31:29] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/nope.jpg
[10:32:00] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I actually don't know why _|Nix|_ added that hack
[10:33:04] <agcolom> Hi, did you get my message regarding the progress bar in a popup demo today? (I pressed enter at the wrong time and I am not sure whether the message actually went to you at all )
[10:33:21] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom
[10:33:25] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw it
[10:33:27] <uGoMobi> nice!
[10:33:31] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[10:33:35] <agcolom> good!
[10:33:45] <Wilto> johnbender: Admiral Parker tells me you’ve been getting your IE10 testing on lately; how we lookin’?
[10:34:08] <agcolom> I couldn't tell whether the message had been sent to me only on not!
[10:34:23] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[10:35:57] <toddparker> hi agcolom - no, where is that demo?
[10:36:28] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i wanted to see if you had any luck with those WP bugs
[10:36:31] <toddparker> looks like no
[10:36:38] <johnbender> Wilto: I need to set up a pipe with browserstack to test my local changes but let me give it a quick whirl
[10:36:51] <agcolom> toddparker: http://jsbin.com/ejafoc/34
[10:36:54] <Wilto> Hey, agcolom.
[10:37:05] <agcolom> Hey Wilto :-)
[10:37:06] <johnbender> Wilto: what's the test case
[10:37:09] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yeah, no luck
[10:37:09] <toddparker> johnbender: feel free to give the WP issues a look. if you can crack the hashchange oddness, I'd prefer to not exclude the back button support there
[10:37:38] <johnbender> toddparker: that's what I'm going to do, though we've had lots of smart people looking at it so it seems bleak
[10:37:48] <toddparker> johnbender: if you open jqm.com/test/ on WP7, navigate to the popup page
[10:37:57] <toddparker> open the first popup and close
[10:38:15] <toddparker> scroll down and open another popup. when you close, you'll see the page scroll around like mad
[10:38:34] <toddparker> also, the blue outline for focus will start to stick on multiple buttons
[10:38:37] <Wilto> Oh, sorry johnbender—was just asking how we were looking overall.
[10:38:45] <Wilto> Unless you mean the WP thing, which: what toddparker said.
[10:38:52] <toddparker> both are hash change related
[10:39:02] <toddparker> or seem to be
[10:40:04] <toddparker> agcolom: you're using UI in that demo?
[10:40:10] <agcolom> toddparker: yes
[10:40:17] <toddparker> probably don't want to use that as an example
[10:40:23] <agcolom> sure
[10:40:26] <toddparker> more than one UI library is enough
[10:40:35] <toddparker> but the progress bar is just two divs
[10:40:40] <toddparker> so you could make one
[10:40:51] <agcolom> yes
[10:40:57] <toddparker> it's barely a widget
[10:41:00] <toddparker> :)
[10:41:12] <Wilto> You can never have too many libraries.
[10:41:47] <agcolom> i just saw a note somewhere where we talked about having a progress bar in a popup as a demo... so I thought i'd give it a try ;-)
[10:42:12] <agcolom> (as a demo for popups)
[10:42:46] <Wilto> johnbender: While you’re having a look-see at the WP issue, I’m going to nuke that conditional.
[10:43:06] <agcolom> while doing it I discovered something very interesting:
[10:44:07] <toddparker> what's that agcolom
[10:44:23] <agcolom> the all the files in jqueryui.com/ui/... have fake equivalent with viruses if you remove the y from jqueryui.com/ui/
[10:44:38] <toddparker> yuck
[10:44:49] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/hackers.jpg
[10:44:54] <toddparker> the internet is a dangerous place
[10:45:01] <toddparker> do they clone the UI site?
[10:45:12] <agcolom> yep! I thought jsbin had been hacked then jqueryui, then realised it was me who had typed the url incorrectly!
[10:45:43] <toddparker> what is the bad URL?
[10:45:55] <agcolom> the bad ones I've tried:
[10:47:05] <agcolom>  WARNING: DO NOT CLICK THERE!!!! http://jquerui.com/ui/jquery.ui.core.js
[10:49:11] <uGoMobi> johnbender: about the WP issue... it's not only that the hash change cause the jump but also links (like the ones to the other popup examples) are broken
[10:49:21] <uGoMobi> not sure if I am telling old news here
[10:50:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: links from popups to popups? or just links to popups?
[10:50:51] <johnbender> I'm having a bitch of a time setting up a tunnel to browserstack
[10:51:08] <uGoMobi> johnbender: sorry, I mean regular links to other pages
[10:51:27] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ah
[10:51:35] <johnbender> let me see if I still have a vm with 7
[10:52:23] <johnbender> agh I don't have my vms with me
[10:53:35] <johnbender> toddparker: do you mind waiting until I can take a look at this tomorrow?
[10:54:50] <toddparker> agcolom: thanks, i just posted this for the team to look at
[10:55:53] <toddparker> johnbender: sure, we can wait.
[10:57:13] <toddparker> i think we should probably proceed with the assumption that we're going to need to kick out old IE from popup back button support since we've already spent a few days looking at this and it seems pretty futile - would you agree Wilto and uGoMobi?
[10:57:45] <toddparker> this exclusion is going to introduce other issues on WP7, I'm sure
[10:57:53] <toddparker> but it seems better than this scrolling madness
[11:01:19] <johnbender> toddparker: has anyone done the work on disabling the close button?
[11:01:32] <johnbender> or changing it so that it works
[11:01:33] <toddparker> in popups?
[11:01:34] <johnbender> ?
[11:01:34] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I agree that no back button support is better than the jumping
[11:01:48] <toddparker> think Wilto is looking at that now
[11:01:50] <Wilto> I’m not worried about introducing more shenanigans in WP7 by removing it, so much as us needing to add more logic.
[11:02:00] <Wilto> Like the “back” button thing.
[11:02:04] <toddparker> yeah, that ^
[11:02:05] <johnbender> that's what I'm thinking
[11:02:14] <Wilto> wilto haet logics
[11:03:57] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll take a look at it tonight
[11:04:02] <johnbender> and see what I can come up with
[11:04:26] <toddparker> ok johnbender
[11:04:40] <Wilto> You’re a brave man, JB.
[11:04:42] <uGoMobi> I don't give up yet either
[11:04:44] <toddparker> i just want to make a call soon and get 1.2 out
[11:04:53] <Wilto> I’ll take care of that IE backdrop hackiness.
[11:04:54] <toddparker> don't give up hope
[11:05:20] <Wilto> Also, I’m noticing that the non-themed backdrop isn’t clickable in old IE; probably an `opacity: 0` thing.
[11:05:37] <uGoMobi> are going to do an RC or beta?
[11:12:11] <uGoMobi> bbl
[11:13:19] <johnbender> toddparker: if I don't get anywhere I'll help out with sorting out the close button issue tomorrow too
[11:13:42] <johnbender> toddparker: though I wonder if those kinds of changes look more like a beta than an RC :(
[11:22:41] <Wilto> I don’t disagree.
[11:39:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/h68wFg
[11:39:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Event: Fixed loading and reloading of touch support. Fixed #4879 - Swipe Event Unit tests not executing correctly. - Brian Edgerton
[11:39:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #4880 from appendto/events-swipe-unit-tests-fix - John Bender
[11:47:12] <johnbender> uGoMobi: Wilto: how exactly do I reproduce the issue in ie7 before I lose you guys
[11:47:18] <johnbender> is there a jsbin/issue etc?
[13:28:52] <uGoMobi> johnbender: the jumping issue is not visible on IE7, only on WP
[13:29:48] <uGoMobi> johnbender: IE7 has a bunch of other issues if you look at the popup page in the docs, but that mostly regards styling
[13:30:07] <uGoMobi> johnbender: there is a problem with the hash on IE7 too though...
[13:31:02] <uGoMobi> johnbender: if you go to jquerymobile.com/test and then navigate to the popup page, popups won't open at all
[13:31:53] <uGoMobi> johnbender: they don't work unless you change the url to http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[13:41:17] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ok
[14:05:53] <Wilto> GOT IT FIXED
[14:06:00] <Wilto> `background-image: url("about:blank");`
[14:06:04] <Wilto> Missed U, IE7.
[14:09:05] <johnbender> Wilto: the scolling?
[14:09:19] <Wilto> Oh, no, different IE7 thing. Sorry.
[14:09:24] <johnbender> Wilto: arg
[14:09:25] <johnbender> lol
[14:09:29] <Wilto> Scroll down and open a popup, close it, and open another.
[14:09:54] <Wilto> And it’ll jump you to the top of the screen then back down. Also, when you close that one, the focus styles will remain on the button that triggered it when they shouldn’t.
[14:16:11] <uGoMobi> Wilto: background-image: url("about:blank"); ... I love that one! It's so IE-ish :)
[14:16:27] <Wilto> Just discovered that a data-URI works there, too.
[14:16:34] <Wilto> It just needs _something_ set as a background.
[14:16:47] <Wilto> so I’ll URI a 1x1 transparent gif; party like it’s 1999.
[14:16:47] <uGoMobi> nice
[14:17:41] <uGoMobi> what's next? adding frames?
[14:17:44] <uGoMobi> :D
[14:27:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/AMgQ7Q
[14:27:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Eliminates need for an IE6/7-specific workaround class, as well as  additional scripting. - Mat Marquis
[14:28:13] <Wilto> I loves me the weird ones.
[14:28:21] <Wilto> johnbender: You having any luck?
[14:34:57] <Wilto> johnbender: I can tag back in, if not.
[14:36:00] <Wilto> I really hate the idea of having something in there like… ‘if this popup contains a “back” button and the client is a Windows Phone, change the “back” button’s behavior to that of clicking the backdrop.’
[14:36:21] <Wilto> … Though I guess we wouldn’t have to specify Windows Phone there, would we?
[14:37:10] <Wilto> If all popup “back” buttons worked like the backdrop, it would probably be fine, yeah?
[14:38:03] <Wilto> Still weird to change behavior like that I guess.
[14:38:09] <Wilto> I agree, Wilto.
[14:38:24] <Wilto> Thanks, Wilto. You’re looking very handsome today, I might add.
[14:39:11] <uGoMobi> don't forget to take your pills Wilto
[14:39:31] <Wilto> We can never agree on which ones to take.
[14:39:47] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:40:15] <Wilto> Anyway, johnbender, lemme know your take. Likewise uGoMobi, gseguin—anyone else involved in the Popupgate scandal.
[14:40:52] <Wilto> Also toddparker I GUESS.
[14:56:35] <Wilto> —None of you got an email from me this morning about the next jQuery event, did you?
[15:05:45] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I did
[15:06:13] <Wilto> Ah, okay. Wasn’t seeing it in my sent mail; I’m still digging my way out of two (2) work days’ worth of emails.
[15:09:18] <uGoMobi> I see that email was premature... should have asked your BOSS first!
[15:10:46] <Wilto> Right? That dude is ruthless.
[15:29:43] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm going to take a look at it tonight when I get home
[15:29:48] <johnbender> I don't have my windows phone on me
[15:29:53] <johnbender> working at a friends house today
