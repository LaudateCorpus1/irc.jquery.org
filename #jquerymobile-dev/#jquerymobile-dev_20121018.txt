[07:06:54] <toddmparker_> Notes from the UI/Mobile session yesterday - http://oksoclap.com/QrXzn7NyZY
[07:17:24] <toddmparker_> http://mustachify.me/?src=http://i.minus.com/jbdTVahSXsE7LY.jpg
[07:17:47] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:18:26] <arschmitz> they missed someone! there is a mustach free face in there!
[07:22:13] <Wilto> My clever disguise is slipping.
[07:24:12] <ryanneufeld> hahah! nice
[07:48:21] <arschmitz> wilto: not sure if you guys found this one yet but apparently ios5 has a fixed position bug where if you scroll programaticly fixed elements visually move but in reality dont so click pass right through.
[07:56:01] <toddmparker_> oof
[07:56:59] <Wilto> …Huh.
[07:57:06] <Wilto> That sounds like the Android bug.
[07:57:25] <arschmitz> yeah its in ios too but its fixed in ios6
[07:57:37] <Wilto> That one may have been way down deep in the icy black heart of Mobile WebKit.
[07:57:56] <arschmitz> setting opacity:1 seems to fix click through but still no interaction
[07:59:06] <frequent> if it wasn't for interacting with fixed elements, a solution would be to just cut them out from paper and glue them to the display :-D
[07:59:47] <frequent> [looking for scissors]
[08:02:32] <Wilto> Hah, the ol’ `opacity` gambit.
[08:02:40] <Wilto> You’re getting the hang of this already, arschmitz.
[08:03:42] <arschmitz> can restore interaction by adjusting body width
[08:03:48] <arschmitz> but that of course causes a flash
[08:04:39] <arschmitz> and it has to be on a setTimeout
[08:09:41] <toddmparker_> voodoo is what we do
[08:18:02] <arschmitz> apparently you dont actually need to change width just set it so setting body to 100% width will fix even its already 100%
[08:24:40] <arschmitz> oh even better doing a deep link like to an id on a page to start there counts as scrolling! so if you have a page and link to an anchor on it anything inside a fixed dosentwork when the page loads!
[08:44:52] <toddmparker_> hmm
[08:45:30] <arschmitz> those arnt a problem not since deeplinking isnt supported in jqm currently but i know its on the roadmap
[08:45:51] <toddmparker_> yeah, it is. be so good to support anchor tags
[08:47:51] <arschmitz> so far the only things that will make them interact again iv found are setting width or display on the body after the scroll finishes.
[09:19:53] <arschmitz> johnbender: Sorry i wasnt around yesterday drove over night from summit in dc to maine so was pretty much dead to the world yesterday.
[09:20:31] <arschmitz> johnbender:i commented on the commit with whats up with the tests though.
[09:26:36] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's fine I just stripped it since it sort of doesn't represent reality, and we don't have an easy way to test that the in class is added
[09:26:43] <johnbender> arschmitz: all is well
[09:26:47] <johnbender> arschmitz: thank you for the bug fix :)
[09:27:04] <johnbender> arschmitz: and don't ever appologize for breaking the build, it's there to be broken :)
[09:27:11] <arschmitz> no problem always happy to help
[10:13:15] <johnbender> Wilto: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies
[10:13:23] <johnbender> definitely check out the red herring falacies
[10:14:40] <johnbender> *fallacies
[10:24:33] <Wilto> I love that page, johnbender.
[10:25:31] <Wilto> “If-by-whiskey” might as well be named “general-purpose web standards defense strategy.”
[10:25:34] <johnbender> Wilto: you're now engaged in a impossibly complex discussion about the lowest common denominator in software development
[10:25:43] <Wilto> YUP
[10:25:47] <Wilto> This is my life.
[10:25:51] <johnbender> it's a social discussion
[10:25:55] <johnbender> which has no answer :/
[10:26:10] <Wilto> I’m trying not to engage. He’s sure intent on it, though.
[10:33:31] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm hoping that this gets much much larger and I get some Twitter followers out of it
[10:33:45] <Wilto> oh god please no
[10:33:46] * johnbender schemes on how to keep is name on the cc list
[10:34:45] <jzaefferer> toddmparker_: the article is rather fun: http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/lg-nexus-4-likely-to-be-star-at-google-event-on-29-october-50009512/ "The event will take place mere hours ahead of the http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/windows-phone-8-gets-spiffing-29-october-uk-debut-50009427/, in what's likely a brazen attempt to purloin Microsoft's thunder, or a ploy to kill off technology journalists by forcing them to type themselves to death."
[10:35:16] <johnbender> jzaefferer: very exciting day, but clearly google is doing that on purpose
[10:35:41] <johnbender> it's like election politics
[10:35:51] <johnbender> *popcorn*
[10:35:53] <jzaefferer> "Pictured extensively in leaked snaps, the so-called Nexus 4 is all but certain to pack a quad-core processor, a 4.7-inch 768x1,280-pixel display and 2GB of RAM."
[10:36:02] <jzaefferer> my poor Nexus S has 384MB
[10:36:09] <jzaefferer> quite in jump in just two years...
[10:36:12] <johnbender> jzaefferer: same, and I much prefer the S form factor :(
[10:36:24] <johnbender> I don't like 5 inch screens
[10:37:56] <jzaefferer> yeah, I like the Nexus S size, too
[10:38:03] <jzaefferer> But I hate the lack of RAM
[10:38:55] <johnbender> jzaefferer: jelly bean has been pretty nice for me
[10:40:48] <johnbender> jzaefferer: though I can't for the life of me find my total RAM, I can't imagine it's different
[10:41:31] <jzaefferer> From home screen, Menu, "Manage Apps", swipe to "Running", has "used" and "free" RAM on bottom
[10:42:03] <jzaefferer> If I add that up, I get 340MB actually
[10:49:46] <johnbender> jzaefferer: same here 344
[10:50:40] <johnbender> Wilto: stirring the pot, though not very effectively I'd imagine
[10:50:51] <Wilto> You are rousing rabbles, johnbender.
[10:51:07] <johnbender> Wilto: as though anyone gives a shit what I say :P
[10:52:08] <Wilto> Hah, dude, if any one person could be the case for web developers being smart as hell, you are it.
[10:53:14] <arschmitz> ASchmitz@billdodgetycodog7
[10:53:37] <arschmitz> ack rogue macro sorry
[10:59:02] <johnbender> Wilto: that is an extremely nice thing to say :)
[10:59:31] <kpepin> <-- back (was AFK)
[11:02:22] <johnbender> are we skipping out meeting this week?
[11:02:26] * johnbender would blame no one
[11:02:57] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, think they’re all held up in meetings today.
[11:03:40] <kpepin> I thought Todd had mentioned at the summit that there was a meeting this week, but he may have changed his mind when talkign with the core team members that were there at the summit after us n00b folks had gone home.  ;)
[11:04:45] <Wilto> Hm; let me check.
[11:04:54] <ajpiano> i'm sitting across from toddmparker_ right now, asking
[11:05:02] <Wilto> ajpiano: MAKE IT SNAPPY
[11:05:03] <kpepin> Nice.
[11:05:04] <kpepin> :)
[11:05:12] <toddmparker_> sorry, i can't make a meeting today
[11:05:17] <Wilto> naw doggs naw
[11:05:18] <toddmparker_> if you all want to org one, go for it
[11:05:20] <kpepin> Wilto's got better places to be apparently.  :)
[11:05:25] <toddmparker_> otherwise, we can just cancel
[11:05:40] <toddmparker_> kpepin: wilto always has better plans
[11:05:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: if everyone's busy and you guys met all week it can wait
[11:05:44] <Wilto> johnbender: Wanna set up a hang-out to yell at these NEW RECRUITS?
[11:05:57] <johnbender> I don't want to get too far down this nav road without consulting you guys
[11:06:14] <johnbender> Wilto: hmm, did you guys give them the low down on what they need to do for commits and stuff?
[11:06:36] <Wilto> Not really, no. Now might be a good time.
[11:06:37] <kpepin> John - they tried, but I messed it up anyways.
[11:07:22] <kpepin> Need to resubmit the stuff Todd had me working on listview-grid later today to the list-grid branch Scott J. had set up for us again.
[11:08:02] <Wilto> Please hold, jQM Probies. Impromptu meeting in a little bit.
[11:08:19] <Wilto> kpepin, arschmitz ^
[11:08:26] <johnbender> Wilto: is everyone ok with me cancelling the formal meeting?
[11:08:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[11:08:40] <Wilto> Cheah cheah.
[11:08:44] <toddmparker_> be cool to have you guys just do an informal check in, even if it's just to wecome some of the new people
[11:08:51] <toddmparker_> johnbender: yes please
[11:08:58] <toddmparker_> mind making an annoucement over there
[11:08:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that's what we were thinking
[11:09:02] <johnbender> a quick google hangout
[11:09:08] <toddmparker_> oh, swett
[11:09:10] <johnbender> I'm going to make a quick checklist of things they should nkow
[11:09:11] <toddmparker_> sweet
[11:09:14] <johnbender> and then we can meet briefly
[11:09:18] <toddmparker_> genius
[11:09:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: can you unsilence me in the meeting channel?
[11:09:49] <johnbender> ajpiano: ^
[11:10:33] <Wilto> Oh, I got it.
[11:10:36] <ajpiano> donezo
[11:11:40] <Wilto> Way to steal my thunder, Sontag.
[11:12:25] <johnbender> Wilto: you can silence the channel again
[11:12:40] <Wilto> I actually forget how to opsify myself.
[11:12:47] <Wilto> ATKINS WAS RIGHT
[11:13:29] <toddmparker_> we should make some more mobile team members ops in the channel
[11:13:46] <toddmparker_> johnbender can deploy, but not op up. hrm
[11:18:21] <johnbender> Wilto: two more minutes
[11:18:24] <johnbender> checklist is almost done
[11:19:07] <jzaefferer> toddmparker_ Wilto: TUMBLR
[11:19:42] <Wilto> A Filament Group gif-posting tumblr is now on the jQuery Mobile 1.3 roadmap.
[11:20:04] <jzaefferer> http://affotd.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/zebra-lion-jpeg.gif
[11:23:07] <kpepin> Nice.  :)
[11:23:25] <kpepin> gotta reboot.  BBL
[11:23:25] <johnbender> am I lame for thinking that the new google laptop is pretty cool
[11:23:59] <johnbender> it's not the most beautiful piece of hardware on the planet but it's so inexpensive
[11:24:14] <Wilto> jzaefferer: http://bukk.it/macromicro.jpg
[11:24:53] <johnbender> Wilto: that cheetah must be really hungry I don't think they normally go after ostriches eh?
[11:25:04] <Wilto> is that true
[11:25:08] <johnbender> no idea
[11:25:12] <Wilto> man you know I ain’t know the sciences
[11:26:18] <arschmitz> wilto: johnbender: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich#Predators
[11:26:41] <johnbender> arschmitz: I went the other way and checked prey animals for chetah's and the ostrich wasn't mentioned
[11:26:45] <johnbender> but it seems feasible
[11:27:00] <Wilto> My dog could take out an ostrich, no problem.
[11:28:07] <johnbender> this video shows it taking 3 of them to get one bird down http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oV6SqyemCk
[11:28:18] <johnbender> seems less likely based on that
[11:28:23] <johnbender> though clearly it happens
[11:28:31] <arschmitz> wilto: untill it saw a tree and went for that instead!
[11:28:35] <johnbender> arschmitz: Wilto: I'm ready
[11:29:50] <Wilto> Cool.
[11:30:03] <johnbender> Wilto: just waiting on kpepin?
[11:30:04] <arschmitz> ok
[11:32:09] <Wilto> Let’s start this sucker up.
[11:33:17] <arschmitz> sounds good
[11:33:20] <johnbender> https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/5acf4395d30021af5c7d57244daa467f933fca28?authuser=0&hl=en
[11:33:23] <johnbender> ?
[11:33:26] <johnbender> not sure if that link works :/
[11:33:59] <arschmitz> ask forgot need to get my laptop for this no cam or mic on this desktop
[11:34:06] <johnbender> cool
[11:34:08] <johnbender> no rush
[11:35:02] <johnbender> did anyone join or am I looking at a Rando?
[11:35:05] <johnbender> Wilto: ?
[11:35:11] <arschmitz> im there
[11:35:15] <johnbender> ahh
[11:35:16] <johnbender> cool
[11:35:17] <arschmitz> but with no cam or mic
[11:35:24] <johnbender> do you have sound?
[11:35:34] <johnbender> you can also use the chat if you don't want to move
[11:35:37] <arschmitz> yeah but my laptop is just about there
[11:36:20] <Wilto> Please hold; bad at computers over here.
[11:36:45] <agcolom> Hi all!
[11:37:02] <Wilto> Hey agcolom!
[11:37:19] <agcolom> Hey Wilto! You got back ok?

[11:40:09] <agcolom> oh! Hope you guys finish not too late and can be back here before I go (6pm)
[11:40:51] <agcolom> johnbender: really sorry you couldn't make it. I hope I get to meet you one day...
[11:40:59] <johnbender> agcolom: lol no worries
[11:41:58] <johnbender> arschmitz: are you still in the caht?
[11:42:05] <johnbender> *chat?
[11:42:10] <arschmitz> im there
[11:42:17] <arschmitz> for some reason mic isnt working
[11:42:48] <arschmitz> many times
[11:43:28] <arschmitz> i havent but had looked at the one that failed
[11:43:31] <arschmitz> ha ha
[11:44:11] <arschmitz> should i add a test to make sure in isnt there though
[11:44:23] <arschmitz> since that was the bug to prevent recursion
[11:46:52] <arschmitz> some
[11:47:30] <arschmitz> yeah i saw the sequence test helper and some of the other helpers
[11:47:44] <arschmitz> i started looking at all those last night
[11:48:10] <arschmitz> yeah i have phantom and have tested with it
[11:49:29] <arschmitz> yeah i can see that
[11:50:20] <arschmitz> i run jenkins and a similar build so im reasonably familier with the process you use
[11:50:49] <arschmitz> ha ha 20 lashes!
[11:51:08] <arschmitz> thats what wilto: had recomended previously
[11:51:56] <arschmitz> i had figured that out already thats why i asked about the in test before i sent a push for the test fix
[11:52:22] <arschmitz> no problem better to know know then f up later
[11:52:33] <johnbender> http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[11:53:00] <johnbender> }
[11:53:01] <arschmitz> yeah i read those before too iv "tried" to be as prepared as possible
[11:53:02] <johnbender> else {
[11:53:09] <johnbender> } else { <----
[11:53:16] <Wilto> +1,000
[11:53:29] <arschmitz> quite a bit
[11:53:36] <arschmitz> its what i use for all my projects
[11:53:49] <arschmitz> semi i did it for my last pushes
[11:53:52] <Wilto> rebase 4-lyfe
[11:54:00] <johnbender>  http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing
[11:54:41] <arschmitz> yeah i read that too basicly anything linked from git iv read my last commits should have been rebased the two that wilto approved for me
[11:54:55] <Wilto> Rebasing: Time can be rewritten!™
[11:55:37] <arschmitz> nice
[11:56:45] <arschmitz> wilto: that goes without saying!
[11:56:50] <Wilto> Troof.
[12:09:17] <arschmitz> wilto: johnbender: thanks for the run down on everything answered a lot of my questions actually
[12:13:35] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: now you know too much. you can't leave the team and must commit, commit, commit
[12:14:13] <arschmitz_> ha ha i can feel the chains already
[12:14:29] <jzaefferer> Wilto toddmparker_: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlwilbVYvUg
[12:15:57] <Wilto> jzaefferer: amazing
[12:25:19] <johnbender> arschmitz: great!
[12:30:00] <johnbender> Wilto: well that little debate seems to have petered out and I got bupkis
[12:30:06] <johnbender> to lunch!
[12:30:20] <arschmitz_> ok wilto: johnbender: time to make good im hoping someone might have some thoughts on a workaround for this ios bug that i havent tried yet
[12:30:21] <johnbender> Also I managed to give kswedberg shit about retweeting ryan dahl
[12:30:44] <johnbender> arschmitz: kk, I'll be back in just a bit if that's ok
[12:31:00] <arschmitz_> thats fine
[12:43:33] <uGoMobi> hey guys
[12:43:35] <uGoMobi> whats up
[12:43:51] <toddmparker_> hey uGoMobi
[12:44:16] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker_
[12:44:29] <toddmparker_> how was DC
[12:44:46] <uGoMobi> i didnt go downtown
[12:45:00] <uGoMobi> my flight was at 12.30
[12:45:07] <toddmparker_> it's looking like I need to go right to the airport so I won't be able to see you and agcolom back at the hotel
[12:45:22] <uGoMobi> well i am in philadelphia
[12:45:43] <toddmparker_> oh, well then
[12:45:45] <agcolom> toddmparker_: DC was great! Have a safe journey home!
[12:45:46] <uGoMobi> so i guess you are right :)
[12:45:51] <toddmparker_> true
[12:45:53] <uGoMobi> hey Anne
[12:45:59] <agcolom> hey Jasper!
[12:46:07] <toddmparker_> thanks, you too agcolom
[12:46:25] <agcolom> Thanks toddmparker_
[12:46:47] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey there
[12:46:57] <uGoMobi> cool to see the guys who joined us at the summit are hanging out here on the dev channel
[12:47:07] <frequent> sticky buttons: you have an email adress, so I can send you login
[12:47:08] <uGoMobi> hey frequent
[12:47:24] <uGoMobi> yup jasper at ugomobi dot com
[12:47:44] <frequent> thx. will send shortly. need to reproduce first...
[12:47:50] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[12:48:51] <agcolom> toddmparker_ uGoMobi https://twitter.com/agcolom/status/258994041008582657/photo/1
[12:48:59] <toddmparker_> cool pic!
[12:49:26] <uGoMobi> nice pic anne
[12:49:43] <uGoMobi> i m kinda jealous now ;-)
[12:50:00] <uGoMobi> but i had fun almost missing my flight :/
[12:50:07] <agcolom> and we were very lucky with the weather.
[12:50:16] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Really? what happened?
[12:50:17] <uGoMobi> yeah i can see that
[12:50:33] <uGoMobi> basically i left the hotel too late
[12:51:10] <agcolom> ok, how long do we need to be there for for international flights?
[12:51:17] <uGoMobi> was working on grid demo and thought leaving 1 hour before departure would do
[12:51:27] <uGoMobi> more than 1 hour!
[12:51:30] <agcolom> (I'm thinking 2.30 - 3h)
[12:52:08] <agcolom> uGoMobi: oh yes!
[12:52:12] <uGoMobi> if you are there 2 hours before departure you will be fine
[12:52:31] <uGoMobi> i left the hotel 11.35 and my flight was 12.27
[12:52:42] <uGoMobi> thats not really smart
[12:53:07] <agcolom> yes indeed!

[13:57:33] <arschmitz_> Wilto: found a fix for the ios bug we were talking about earlier and it also fixes the bug with the keyboard pop i wanted you thoughts on it?
[16:46:00] <johnbender> arschmitz_: argh yes
[16:46:01] <johnbender> so sorry
[16:46:15] <johnbender> I had a meeting at 2 and then got totally burried in nav
