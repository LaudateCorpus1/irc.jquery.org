[10:07:29] <Wilto> garann: We were seeing some (expected) flakiness in iOS5 on orientation change and such.
[10:08:08] <Wilto> I’m kinda thinking we might be able to shore some of that up in CSS, but it’s kind of “black magic” territory. I’m not sure what, if anything, might help.
[10:09:01] <Wilto> My thinking is that the extent of our JS involvement in the fixed toolbars is a check to see if position: fixed; is working, using scrollTop. If not, maybe we could bolt on a class to style against, y’know?
[10:10:53] <Wilto> I don’t know if the browsers that fall back to position: static behavior _actually_ treat it as static, or if you can still apply a z-index to it, or what. So we might need that .no-fixed class or whatever so we can make them relative.
[10:12:20] <Wilto> I know at least one of the Androids was treating them as position: absolute, too—so the footer was fixed at the bottom of the initial viewport, and once you scroll it’s just kind of floating there in the same position. That class would give us a workaround for that too.
[10:13:04] <Wilto> (This is the kind of response that one gets when I’m procrastinating.)
[11:27:50] <garann> Wilto: so.. i should add in some UA sniffing stuff?
[12:51:24] <Wilto> oh got my heart
[12:51:31] <Wilto> s/got/god
[12:51:57] <Wilto> UA detection gives me hives.
[12:53:08] <Wilto> I’m thinking we could do something with scrollTop. If it’s really fixed, the users’ position on the page and the top of the header should be in the same place—maybe we build in a few pixels’ worth of padding to account for weird little browser quirks.
[12:53:35] <Wilto> If they’re not the same, we can assume position: fixed isn’t supported correctly, and we tack a class onto the header and footer so we can tweak things a little.
[12:54:21] <Wilto> Now, I assume that would mean binding to “resize,” which I kind of hate a lot.
[13:00:43] <garann> Wilto: so we'd have to test that once they began scrolling, right?
[13:01:28] <Wilto> Yeah; kinda sucks. Visually it’s fine—nothing looks broken before the user interacts with the page in some way.
[13:01:47] <Wilto> Wait, not “resize.” On scroll, obviously.
[13:01:51] <Wilto> My brain is fried today.
[13:06:06] <garann> likewise
[13:06:08] <garann> k, i will look into doing that
[13:07:18] <Wilto> We could always store something that says “nah, son—this check was performed already,” then unbind the event.
[13:08:10] <Wilto> We’d really only need it to check as of the first scroll event, I would think.
[13:12:41] <garann> modernizr-style?
[13:14:20] <Wilto> Yep.
[13:15:12] <Wilto> Maybe that’s what I’ll name my fork of “yepnope.” “Aww yeah/nah, son.”
[13:37:26] <garann> catchy!
