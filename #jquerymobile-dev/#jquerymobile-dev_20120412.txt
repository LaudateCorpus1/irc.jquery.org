[07:43:52] <Wilto> S’broke, gseguin.
[07:44:20] <Wilto> Oh, it’s looking for something on localhost.
[09:02:16] <gseguin> oh crap
[09:02:20] <gseguin> let me fix that
[09:05:31] <gseguin> Wilto: working now
[09:06:17] <Wilto> Sweeeet.
[09:18:10] <gseguin> danheberden: do you have an ETA on that node machine?
[09:26:30] <danheberden> gseguin ya, but we just completely revamped the entire server plan
[09:26:33] <danheberden> like.. 30 minutes ago
[09:27:05] <gseguin> ok
[09:32:51] <Wilto> What’s the plan? Get some Pentium IIIs up ins?
[09:46:11] <danheberden> Wilto oh yes
[09:46:55] <Wilto> Sweet.
[09:49:08] <gseguin> danheberden: I don't have a problem with continuing to host the builder service on the joyent no.de machine while we sort out our servers thing
[09:49:57] <gseguin> unless the team is uncomfortable using a server outside of our infrastructure even temporarily
[09:52:07] <Wilto> I AM
[09:52:22] <gseguin> OH
[09:52:25] <Wilto> No, I’m cool with it as long as we know it’ll hold up.
[09:52:32] <Wilto> But yeah, question for jQuery Proper.
[09:52:57] <danheberden> gseguin i'm only uncomfortable with the divergence between mobile's services/tasks with the rest of the project
[09:53:04] <danheberden> i'm totally fine with it on no.de
[09:53:26] <gseguin> danheberden: what divergence?
[09:53:48] <Wilto> We’re deviants.
[09:54:09] <gseguin> but that's not new, is it
[09:54:11] <gseguin> ?
[09:54:23] <Wilto> Not by a longshot.
[09:54:41] <danheberden> gseguin no - just talking in generalities
[09:55:13] <danheberden> i think we got an even cooler server plan now, though
[09:55:21] <danheberden> gnarf is tearing up some shit now
[09:55:30] <danheberden> he's like FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU servers!
[09:55:39] <gseguin> cool
[09:55:40] <Wilto> Dreamhost? GoDaddy? Geocities?
[09:58:40] <danheberden> Wilto on milkhost.in
[09:58:48] <Wilto> I am so afraid to click that.
[09:59:17] <Wilto> “750 Rupees per year.”
[09:59:48] <Wilto> OUTSOURCING TO HYRULE
[10:10:25] <Wilto> gseguin: How we lookin’ on the alphanumeric sorting stuff?
[10:32:46] <gseguin> Wilto: still need to work on that
[10:33:14] <gseguin> I was polishing the filter mechanism to be able to prepend copyrights to the custom built bundles
[10:33:30] <Wilto> Ooh.
[10:33:34] <Wilto> Baller.
[10:46:12] <gseguin> johnbender, Wilto, kinblas, toddparker: I'm not going to make it to the meeting today, I have a conflicting meeting here.
[10:46:30] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[10:46:33] <johnbender> I'll start the hangout
[10:47:02] <Wilto> Cool, cool.

[10:52:10] <johnbender> I'm assuming that's the right link
[10:52:32] <johnbender> whenever we start the meeting toddparker should post that in the jquery meeting
[10:54:21] <Wilto> Just wolfing down lunch right quick; be there in five.
[11:01:20] <johnbender> kinblas: are you joining us today?
[11:01:23] <toddparker>   hey
[11:01:42] <kinblas> johnbender: I can yeah, not much to add though
[11:02:00] <kinblas> toddparker: you need tyler to join?
[11:07:22] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm of the opinion that he should join regularly but I'll leave that up to you guys
[11:07:48] <Wilto> http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/builder/
[11:09:21] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto you guys cut out hard core there for second
[11:09:31] <johnbender> or you did form me at least
[11:09:57] <Wilto> Technical difficulties.
[11:15:41] <Wilto> danheberden: Hey, you got five minutes?
[11:15:43] <Wilto> danheberden: https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/69aec99c98168dfd142ba19d77b9e419827f7f08?
[11:40:05] <danheberden> Wilto hey
[11:40:34] <Wilto> danheberden: Just wanted to see if you had a sec to update er’rybody on the server stuff.
[11:40:57] <danheberden> ya, lemme switch internet and get where i can talk
[11:43:42] <Wilto> Thanks, dude.
[11:43:59] <danheberden> Wilto but i have nothing to say. NOTHING! haha
[11:44:09] <Wilto> Do some impressions, brah.
[11:53:36] <johnbender> did everyone get dropped or just me?
[11:53:57] <johnbender> just me :D
[11:55:01] <Wilto> Nope, everyone. “Fatal server something.”
[11:55:03] <chee> i don't think it was just you

[12:09:30] <gnarf> HEY!
[12:10:08] <danheberden> regarding the m5 ui widget factory stuff: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2012/03/jquery-ui-1-9-milestone-7-accordion/
[12:10:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: says you should use the widget factory from master
[12:10:15] <danheberden> might want to at least test out milestone 7
[12:10:19] <gnarf> :)
[12:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> I said no such thing
[12:10:30] <gnarf> or i'm saying you should
[12:10:38] <gnarf> because it should be the newest / bestest
[12:15:40] <kinblas> anyone know the magic sauce to get .htaccess files to be recognized on Mac OSX?
[12:16:25] <kinblas> I've tried modifying the /etc/apache2/httpd.conf so that AllowOverride All is set ... and I've modified the /etc/apache2/users/<user>.conf file to do the same but still no luck
[12:16:49] <tbenzige> hey toddparker. wondering if float: right is the best choice for the right set of buttons in new TR toolbar
[12:16:54] <tbenzige> on my 15 inch monitor: http://webpro.host.adobe.com/people/tbenzige/share/Screen%20Shot%202012-04-12%20at%2011.27.25%20AM%20%282%29.png
[12:17:29] <JasonDScott> toddparker: Yes it is happening on all 7.1 devices I have tried
[12:25:17] <gnarf> toddparker: but yeah - use WF from jquery-ui master
[12:28:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/6VKGHA

[12:28:17] <toddparker> ok, thanks
[12:28:35] <toddparker> appreciate it gnarf
[12:28:44] <toddparker> do you antiquate that changing at all?
[12:28:50] <toddparker> anticipate
[12:29:05] <toddparker> TAC (thanks auto-correct)
[12:29:21] <toddparker> johnbender: ok, i updated the docs for 1.1.0 final
[12:29:29] <toddparker> ready to tag whenever
[12:29:38] <toddparker> or build anyway
[12:30:42] <gseguin> wait, before tagging
[12:30:52] <gseguin> I need to test my filter and push it
[12:31:10] <gseguin> it won't have any impact on our code
[12:31:15] <gseguin> this is just for the builder
[12:31:35] <gseguin> problem is I can't get back to it until 1pm ish PST
[12:31:54] <gseguin> toddparker, johnbender: ^
[12:34:46] <gseguin> or we can tag and we'll release 1.1.1 when it's builder ready

[12:50:07] <toddparker> gseguin - waiting a few hours is fine…I just wanted to get my stuff done so I wasn't hold up Bender
[12:50:20] <toddparker> it's still early on the west coast
[12:50:43] <toddparker>  as long as you, johnbender and tbenzige are coordinating on timing, we're ok
[12:51:00] <toddparker> i just want to give tyler enough time to stage and push the new TR on 1.1.0
[12:54:41] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Sorry, got kicked off ... any problems with popup-widget?
[12:54:56] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Nope; master should be all merged in.
[12:55:07] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Awesome!
[12:55:30] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Did you push? I'm not seeing the merge.
[12:56:41] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/popup
[12:56:42] <Wilto> Waaait.
[12:56:54] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: The branch is popup-widget ...
[12:57:02] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: popup is old, AFAIK.
[12:57:02] <Wilto> Yes. Right. Ahem.
[12:57:04] <Wilto> One moment, please.
[12:57:09] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[12:59:05] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Merged cleanly for me, locally.
[12:59:18] <Wilto> Oh, sweet. Okay, five minutes.
[13:06:59] <johnbender> toddparker: just let me know when you want me to deploy
[13:07:03] <toddparker> should we delete the old popup branch?
[13:07:32] <toddparker> johnbender: i'm set but gseguin wanted to wait a bit for him to test something for the DL builder
[13:08:50] <Wilto> Let’s see if I broke somethin’!
[13:08:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to popup-widget: http://git.io/NoybBA
[13:08:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] Merge branch 'master' into popup-widget - Mat Marquis
[13:09:03] <Wilto> one
[13:09:26] <Wilto> Oh, right, okay.
[13:09:30] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Should be good now.
[13:09:47] <johnbender> toddparker: cool beans
[13:15:23] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Awesome! Thanks 1.0e6!
[14:07:22] <toddparker> gseguin: you back?
[14:07:29] <gseguin> yup
[14:07:30] <gseguin> and done
[14:07:57] <gseguin> pushing
[14:08:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/ND3buA
[14:08:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added minified version of license - Ghislain Seguin
[14:08:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Prepend right copyright to the passed content - Ghislain Seguin
[14:11:23] <gseguin> toddparker: small hiccup, sorting it out
[14:12:39] <toddparker> kk
[14:29:51] <gseguin> ?BOOM
[14:30:36] <gseguin> toddparker: now sorting and we're cool
[14:31:39] <gseguin> it'd be great if one of you could test the bundle and make sure that if you put the produced custom bundle in an html page things work
[14:31:55] <gseguin> otherwise I'll get to it later
[14:37:26] <toddparker> awesome gseguin
[14:37:34] <toddparker> Wilto:  will give it a test
[14:38:05] <toddparker> i don't see the alpha sort here: http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/builder/
[14:43:57] <Wilto> Huh, yeah, no alphanumeric sorting goin’ on here.
[14:51:37] <gseguin> yeah not in yet
[14:51:40] <gseguin> working on it
[14:51:47] <toddparker> ok
[14:52:04] <Wilto> Whoop, totally misread that too.
[14:55:56] <gseguin> Wilto: did you download a bundle?
[14:56:05] <Wilto> I did.
[14:56:10] <gseguin> 'cause I'm about to break that page momentarily
[14:56:12] <gseguin> ok
[14:56:41] <Wilto> Break away.
[15:03:56] <gseguin> Wilto: alpha sorting for both sections and inside sections right?
[15:04:13] <Wilto> Yessir, if that’s equal effort.
[15:04:28] <Wilto> I could live with just sorting the sections, but both would be awesome.
[15:08:45] <gseguin> BOOM
[15:10:04] <toddparker> looks sweet
[15:10:33] <toddparker> so gseguin - how much traffic could that server handle?
[15:10:43] <toddparker> thinking we might want to just do a tiny alpha?
[15:10:52] <toddparker> ask people to request access
[15:10:56] <Wilto> I have already sought to entice the internet with the promise of builders: https://twitter.com/wilto/status/190482384049799170
[15:10:56] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from wilto: Something awesome is coming. http://t.co/z3PWAVJp ★ http://bit.ly/HAFdaX
[15:11:07] <Wilto> Not that the repo isn’t public, but y’know.
[15:11:49] <gseguin> I think the backend will do fine
[15:12:10] <gseguin> as for the front end, it has to move to a real web server
[15:13:29] <gseguin> toddparker: what webserver is going to host it?
[15:13:41] <gseguin> other thing is we need a combo to select the branch
[15:13:58] <gseguin> 'cause it will work for both 1.1 and master
[15:14:33] <gseguin> but yeah having some feedback would be great
[15:15:46] <Wilto> Fo’ sho’.
[15:19:53] <gseguin> Wilto: wanna put that select (with only "master") and style it and I'll hook it up?
[15:21:54] <Wilto> Oh, if you just wanna chuck a basic select in there anywhere, I’ll take care of the fine-tuning later.
[15:22:08] <gseguin> cool
[15:23:42] <Wilto> I wouldn’t stress, though.
[15:23:47] <Wilto> —Well, actually, nevermind.
[15:24:23] <Wilto> I was gonna say “we can just hard-wire it to 1.1 for now,” but for the sake of the alpha it would help to be able to patch and check things in a builder context right away.

[15:28:27] <johnbender> toddparker: am I green to tag/deploy?
[15:28:36] <toddparker> yes indeed
[15:28:38] <johnbender> kk
[15:28:40] <johnbender> deploying
[15:28:45] <toddparker> unless gseguin has an objection
[15:28:47] <johnbender> I'll report back
[15:28:53] <toddparker> be good to build this for tbenzige
[15:29:01] <toddparker> so he can start testing all that
[15:29:57] <gseguin> no objection here
[15:32:03] <johnbender> we've been green for a while now on the test suite and we disabled the build success notifications so I got worried that jenkins got stalled on the adobe server
[15:32:07] <johnbender> not the case
[15:32:11] <johnbender> built 52 mins ago
[15:32:12] <johnbender> :D
[15:32:16] * johnbender gets back to work
[15:33:16] <toddparker> so those files should already be on the CDN?
[15:33:21] <toddparker> johnbender ^^
[15:33:25] <johnbender> not done yet
[15:33:31] <johnbender> running the deploy now
[15:33:35] <toddparker> ah,ok sorry for the misunderstanding
[15:33:36] <toddparker> k
[15:33:54] <johnbender> toddparker: my fault, I meant the test suite has been green
[15:38:14] <gseguin> Wilto: check it out!
[15:38:26] <gseguin> works with the popup-widget branch
[15:38:50] <gseguin> oh wait... :D
[15:39:15] <johnbender> toddparker: one thing I forgot it will default to the latest not 1.1.0 for the demos
[15:39:18] <johnbender> err
[15:39:25] <johnbender> the latest that isn't a beta, alpha or rc
[15:39:38] <johnbender> so /demos/ -> /demos/1.1.0/ right now
[15:39:46] <johnbender> should I just pull that folder out of there for now?
[15:39:49] <toddparker> that's ok
[15:39:53] <johnbender> kk
[15:39:56] <toddparker> so it re-directs
[15:40:14] <johnbender> yah
[15:40:27] <johnbender> toddparker: it's all in place /cc tbenzige
[15:42:12] <tbenzige> thanks johnbender
[15:42:31] <johnbender> I love when the deploy build target "just works"
[15:42:34] <johnbender> that's not often :(
[15:50:05] <toddparker> woo too thanks johnbender
[15:50:50] <toddparker> ok guys, think we're in good shape
[15:50:55] <toddparker> i'm going to head out
[15:51:03] <toddparker> but i'll be working on the blog tonight
[15:51:06] <toddparker> so i'll be online
[15:51:13] <toddparker> email me if i'm not in irc
[15:51:30] <gseguin> woohoo exciting!
[15:51:31] <toddparker> CDN files look good!
[15:51:40] <toddparker> yeah, this is a fantastic release
[15:51:54] <toddparker> awesome work all around. seriously, i can't thank you all enough
[16:38:48] <Wilto> Lookin’ good, gseguin.
[21:33:10] <gseguin> johnbender: did you tag?
[21:40:33] <gseguin> I just tested a custom bundle and it seems to work
[21:41:14] <gseguin> the only thing that's missing from the zip is the sprite
[23:26:16] <johnbender> gseguin: I didn't push the tag yet
[23:26:27] <johnbender> waiting to make sure that we don't run into anything funny first that requires fixing
[23:26:31] <johnbender> I can if you need me to
