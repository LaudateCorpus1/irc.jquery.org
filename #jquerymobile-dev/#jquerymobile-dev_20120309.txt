[07:07:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #778: FAILURE in 25 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/778/
[07:07:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> dave.methvin: Make jQuery Mobile compatible with jQuery 1.7.2rc1.
[07:17:19] <Wilto> Good morning all, and screw you too Jenkins.
[07:34:47] <Wilto> In my ongoing quest to become One of Those Terminal Guys, I learned about `alias` today. It’s like Flowers for Algernon up in here.
[07:40:04] <gseguin> DAMMIT, UNIT TESTS!
[07:42:21] <Wilto> The failure page isn’t coming up for me. Is this a legit failure?
[07:42:50] <gseguin> works for me
[07:43:01] <gseguin> works for you
[07:43:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!

[07:43:04] <jqm-jenkins-bot> dave.methvin: Suggested performance improvements for checkboxradio widget.
[07:43:16] <gseguin> heh!
[07:43:28] <gseguin> now I like you Jenkins
[07:43:49] <Wilto> I only go as far as “grudging tolerance.”
[07:43:58] <Wilto> I’m all about blaming the messenger.
[07:44:07] <gseguin> :)
[07:44:48] <gseguin> On that note, I'm off today so you fine gents (and ladies) have a great day and weekend
[07:45:01] <Wilto> Have a good one, dude.
[07:59:21] <Wilto> Hey johnbender, tell me if this sounds like it would be a crazytime test:
[07:59:57] <Wilto> ‘If anything on the page post-enhancement has a class that contains “undefined,” sound the alarms.’
[08:00:23] <Wilto> That has happened a couple of times, and it’s a tough one to catch unless you happen to notice a hover isn’t working or a theme won’t change.
[08:07:30] <DaveMethvin> Wow, I can't even get a SUCCESS in core, I like your Jenkins better
[08:19:30] <johnbender> Wilto: nope I wouldn't think that was odd at all
[08:19:47] <Wilto> \o/
[08:19:55] <Wilto> Doin’ it.
[08:20:01] <johnbender> Wilto: we work in an weak-dynamic language
[08:20:13] <johnbender> Wilto: I guess I'd wonder what page that would be
[08:20:17] <johnbender> do you have a kitchen sink?
[08:20:20] <Wilto> Yeah, I was just thinking that.
[08:21:15] <Wilto> …what, me personally? Like a separate test suite?
[08:22:38] <Wilto> I also missed a prime opportunity to respond with “your FACE is a weak-dynamic language,” and I’m a little disappointed in myself.
[08:25:42] <Wilto> I guess it could go under `page`…?
[08:26:35] <Wilto> Or maybe I should add a kitchen sink directory to tests/unit.
[08:41:08] <johnbender> Wilto: if you come up with a kitchen sink page I could certainly use it
[08:41:27] <Wilto> Right then. On it.
[08:41:36] <johnbender> Wilto: phonegap isn't subdirectory friendly
[08:42:02] <Wilto> ?mlm
[08:42:03] <bot-t> much like myself
[08:42:06] <johnbender> or I should say that phonegap isn't sudirectory friendly by default so far as I can tell
[08:43:02] <Wilto> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6602549/phonegap-when-deployed-on-device-none-of-the-styles-or-javascript-files-are-lo
[08:43:16] <Wilto> I don’t know what the hell any of that means, but maybe there’s a clue up in there.
[08:47:13] <johnbender> Wilto: yah using java defeats the purpose though, because we can't automate the build through the phonegap website
[08:47:28] <Wilto> Oh, right, right.
[10:06:35] <johnbender> hey guys
[10:06:50] <johnbender> I need to step out to pick up my mother in law from the airport
[10:07:00] <johnbender> Wilto: I can work on that kitchen sink page when I get back if you want
[10:07:35] <Wilto> Already picking at it.
[10:07:46] <Wilto> It’ll most assuredly need a once-over from you, though.
[10:40:36] <droose> has anyone here experienced hanging on the loading screen in between page changes?
[10:40:36] <droose> i upgraded to 1.0.1 and moved from a multipagetemplate setup to a singlepage template setup ever since then my asus transformer doesnt handle page transitions but my htc evo and ipad all work great
[10:45:56] <Dragooon> Is it normal for Symbian to lag like hell?
[10:46:07] <Wilto> Hi droose—this channel is for the developers of jQuery Mobile itself to collaborate. For general support, you’ll want to hit up #jquerymobile
[10:46:42] <droose> ok thanks Wilto
[10:46:46] <droose> sorry
[10:46:50] <Wilto> Dragooon: Admittedly I haven’t spent a lot of quality time with Symbian, apart from checking on specific issues.
[10:48:19] <Dragooon> Wilto: Still, was it usable?
[10:48:40] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, in my experience.
[10:49:00] <Dragooon> Was that 1.0 or 1.1?
[10:51:15] <Wilto> It was a while back. Hang on; let me see if we have a Symbian gadget charged.
[10:52:37] <Wilto> Which one we talkin’, “Anna?”
[10:52:52] <Dragooon> Any symbian device
[10:53:00] <Dragooon> Wait, let me check
[10:53:58] <Dragooon> Bella
[10:54:05] <Dragooon> Which one is older?
[10:54:08] <Dragooon> Bella or Anna?
[10:54:35] <Wilto> Anna, then Belle.
[10:54:53] <Wilto> So this is the older of the two, and it seems okay… Any page in particular?
[10:54:57] <Dragooon> Yeah, it was Symbian^3
[10:55:09] <Wilto> I’m hitting list views—those tend to involve the most enhancement lag.
[10:55:17] <Dragooon> Does it lag?
[10:55:35] <Wilto> Nope, feels okay.
[10:55:44] <Dragooon> http://smf-media.com/community/index.php?thememode=mobile < How does this work?
[10:58:34] <Wilto> …It seems okay.
[10:58:46] <Wilto> Dragooon: Are you working on a specific jQuery Mobile issue?
[10:59:01] <Dragooon> Wilto: One of my users were reporting serious lag on Symbian^3 devices
[10:59:21] <Dragooon> I'm trying to figure out if it is related to jQM or some of my specific code
[10:59:28] <Wilto> Ah.
[10:59:50] <Dragooon> not having a Symbian^3 device makes it that much harder
[11:00:36] <Wilto> Yeah, this is a channel for the developers of jQuery Mobile itself—for issues like this, it’s best to cross-reference jquerymobile.com/test or create a reduced test case using this template: http://jsbin.com/omacox/edit
[11:01:30] <Wilto> I assumed you were working on a specific issue. I’m sure you can understand where we can’t test individual users’ sites, or we’d never actually get any work done on jQM itself.
[11:01:39] <Dragooon> Yes, it's fine
[11:01:41] <Dragooon> Thanks for the help
[11:01:49] <Wilto> No worries.
[11:04:05] <Wilto> Well well well, if it isn’t kinblas!
[11:04:14] <Wilto> How goes, stranger?
[11:04:25] <kinblas> heh busy
[11:11:32] <Wilto> We saved some bugs for you; don’t you worry about that.
[11:21:43] <scottjehl> hey all
[11:22:03] <scottjehl> I hear dev types hang out in these parts?
[11:22:18] <Wilto> THIS CHANNEL IS FOR jQM DEVELOPERS ONLY, SCOTT.
[11:24:03] <scottjehl> OH RIGHT. WELL, GO EASY ON ME
[11:24:16] <scottjehl> is johnbender around?
[11:25:05] <Wilto> He’s out for the afternoon, I believe. Should be back later on.
[11:28:07] <scottjehl> so, I am working out issue #3779
[11:28:38] <scottjehl> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3779
[11:28:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3779 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (16h, 15m ago): data-overlay-theme bug in 1.1 rc1
[11:29:15] <scottjehl> I think that the following line, should include .parentNode.
[11:29:16] <scottjehl> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L164
[11:29:30] <scottjehl> var e = el[ 0 ].parentNode
[11:29:36] <scottjehl> for the first while() pass
[11:29:46] <scottjehl> otherwise it's just hidding the element itself
[11:29:57] <Wilto> Oh, that makes sense. “Get the parent’s theme, and failing that, get the theme of the element itself.”
[11:30:03] <Wilto> I uh kinda thought it did that.
[11:30:52] <scottjehl> well I think it's that the first iteration is using the element itself currently
[11:31:05] <scottjehl> but it should be starting on the parentNode, ya?
[11:31:11] <Wilto> I’d think, yeah.
[11:31:34] <scottjehl> did you write this part btw? sorry I thought Bender had made it
[11:31:40] <Wilto> kinblas, you on the clock? Any thoughts?
[11:31:44] <scottjehl> if you did, even better :)
[11:31:48] <Wilto> Oh, no, wasn’t me.
[11:31:53] <scottjehl> ah ok
[11:32:18] <scottjehl> well, I'm guessing this caused a number of not-real inheritance bug workarounds recently, if so
[11:32:30] <kinblas> regarding that line
[11:32:39] <kinblas> closest includes nodes int he collection doesn't it?
[11:32:52] <scottjehl> but we don't care about closest here do we?
[11:33:11] <scottjehl> (yes, closest typically does tho). (hey Kin! :) )
[11:33:23] <kinblas> scottjehl: hey-oh
[11:33:55] <kinblas> so if an element has one of those classes on it
[11:34:01] <kinblas> including the one passed in
[11:34:03] <scottjehl> unable to catch you in these parts so much these days. Good to see ya
[11:34:07] <kinblas> it should get that thee right?
[11:34:18] <scottjehl> problem is, it's always getting C
[11:34:29] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah ... I'm tryin' to help out with Muse and doin' some other stuff internally at the moment
[11:34:33] <scottjehl> or default
[11:34:55] <scottjehl> oh.. I meant that as.. I don't get in here enough.. not you :)
[11:35:11] <kinblas> scottjehl: heh I'm the same way as of late
[11:35:22] <kinblas> scottjehl: WIlto: so what was the question with that line?
[11:36:13] <kinblas> I guess what I was thinking at the time was that if it had one of those classes on it already with a theme letter, that was the theme that should be used
[11:36:23] <kinblas> not anything inherited, which is why I started with the current element
[11:36:48] <scottjehl> hmm. you know, I think the bug is not in this function, now that you mentioned the closest() deal
[11:37:53] <scottjehl> I think the page plugin (when looking for the themed parent) needs to call getInheritedTheme( el.parentNode ) instead
[11:38:03] <kinblas> right-o
[11:38:09] <scottjehl> or $el.parent()
[11:38:29] <scottjehl> okay cool. despite the confusing comments, this was helpful. Thanks :)
[11:39:05] <kinblas> scottjehl: btw, I feel really bad that I haven't done anything with your scroller yet
[11:39:41] <scottjehl> meh, I have a minor refactor in a branch that's almost there. once that's in, I could use your eyes
[11:39:44] <kinblas> after we talked I was volunteered to do some extra-curicular activities for my son's school that kind of sucked up my free-time :-)
[11:39:48] <scottjehl> for now, not worth it
[11:39:58] <kinblas> ok
[11:40:19] <scottjehl> that there sounds like a priority to me.
[11:40:56] <kinblas> scottjehl: where you at now
[11:40:57] <kinblas> ??
[11:41:16] <scottjehl> we're in Sri Lanka. Southern coast
[11:41:32] <kinblas> and dang ... where is that place that todd vacationed at? Looked like a postcard
[11:41:42] <scottjehl> I still need to see the pix
[11:41:56] <scottjehl> been on the usb dongle - slow connex
[11:42:40] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquery: jQuery 1.7.2 Release Candidate 1 is now available! Happy testing! http://t.co/ZrtKMbhK ★ http://bit.ly/xWeN30
[11:43:06] <scottjehl> what now
[11:43:56] <Wilto> live() -> on() -> ultrabind()
[11:44:04] <Wilto> Adjust your code accordingly.
[11:51:50] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/LhDHPg
[11:51:50] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] parent is actually what we're looking for here, given that getInheritedTheme mimics the closest() method. Fixes #3779 - scottjehl
[13:10:36] <Wilto> More git-inclined folks than I: is `git log --name-status HEAD^..HEAD` the most practical way to pull up a summary of recent commits?
[13:15:43] <Wilto> johnbender: Ping.
[13:21:57] <johnbender> Wilto: looking
[13:22:55] <johnbender> Wilto: what do you want to see in the log output
[13:23:27] <johnbender> that will show you the last two commits in the log
[13:23:56] <johnbender> --name-status according to the manpage shows the name and status of the changed files
[13:25:18] <Wilto> Oh, it’s giving me the whole mess. Check it: http://wil.to/_/commits.gif
[13:25:52] <johnbender> Wilto: that's because you're on a branch
[13:25:58] <johnbender> hmm
[13:26:03] <Wilto> Truly, git is like jongel.
[13:26:12] <johnbender> actually that shouldn't matter
[13:26:29] <Wilto> Oh, huh. I get one commit on master.
[13:26:34] <johnbender> is `commits` just an alias for that command you pasted?
[13:26:38] <Wilto> Oh, yeah.
[13:26:41] <johnbender> Wilto: which makes sense to me
[13:26:45] <johnbender> HEAD~
[13:26:51] <johnbender> or HEAD^
[13:26:58] <johnbender> means HEAD minus one commit
[13:27:03] <johnbender> so one commit further back in history
[13:27:10] <Wilto> You see that sweet action? Aliases, dotfiles, and whatnot? Fit me for a fedora and some cargo shorts, because I am _committing_ to this terminal thing.
[13:27:13] <johnbender> HEAD~~ means two
[13:27:17] <Wilto> Ohh.
[13:27:41] <johnbender> Wilto: HEAD~3 means three
[13:27:44] <johnbender> or HEAD~~~
[13:28:00] <johnbender> not clear why the behaves that way on a different branch
[13:28:09] <johnbender> it must assume master for one of the head refs in the command
[13:28:36] <Wilto> No one truly understands why computers do the things they do. They are nature’s greatest mystery.
[13:28:41] <Wilto> i’m so tired
[13:29:46] <johnbender> Wilto: it's been a long week
[13:29:59] <Wilto> That it has, sir.
[13:30:20] <Wilto> Anyway, this “kitchen sink” thing. Any other global-ish tests you’ve been dying to see?
[13:31:29] <johnbender> Wilto: embedded page
[13:31:37] <johnbender> with one normal link and one that's a dialog link
[13:33:00] <Wilto> Hm, okay.
[13:40:49] <johnbender> Wilto: toolbars?
[13:40:57] <johnbender> it would be good to throw it all in there :D
[13:40:59] <Wilto> I’ve been called worse.
[13:41:16] <Wilto> What would I be testing on the toolbars?
[13:41:56] <johnbender> Wilto: I guess that they work when you scroll or that they fall back to something
[13:42:11] <Wilto> Oh, a general fixed test.
[13:42:19] <Wilto> Thaaat’s a tough one…
[13:42:25] <johnbender> Wilto: sorry
[13:42:31] <johnbender> I just want a kitchen sink page in general
[13:42:34] <johnbender> not for a test
[13:42:37] <Wilto> No, no, it’s cool—that’s good stuff.
[13:42:49] <johnbender> don't worry about banging your head against that one
[13:43:00] <johnbender> I'll just steal what your doing for our phonegap app
[13:43:15] <Wilto> “One of everything?”
[13:44:21] <johnbender> that was my thinking
[13:45:36] <Wilto> Makes sense to me.
[13:49:17] <Wilto> I’ll see what I can do for a fixed test.
[13:49:27] <Wilto> That should be interesting.
[13:52:28] <Wilto> …speaking of interesting, I think namespacing is broken for data-position="fixed".
[13:56:30] <Wilto> Nope, my B.
[14:29:02] <johnbender> Wilto: tabs == lawl
[14:29:03] <johnbender> :D
[14:29:16] <Wilto> BRING THE RUCKUS, INTERNET
[14:29:28] <Wilto> I love/hate those guys; the internet.
[14:31:54] <Wilto> But seriously, we’re all in agreement on Wars > Trek, right? I’d hate to have to leave the project.

[15:17:43] <Wilto> So, /kitchensink is obviously a mess, but I’m gonna push it to master anyhow. All you from there, johnbender.
[15:18:15] <Wilto> Actually, no, I take that back.
[15:18:32] <Wilto> I got a couple things I patched up quick while I was putting it together—I’m gonna hang onto it until those tests are in.
