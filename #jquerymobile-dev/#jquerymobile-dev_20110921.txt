[01:56:07] <aaronmcadam> hi guys have any of you been able to open a fiddle's result on mobile properly?
[01:56:21] <aaronmcadam> i thought there used to be a button for mobile
[01:57:02] <aaronmcadam> trying to look at a test case I've made
[02:01:46] <aaronmcadam> found it guys: http://blog.jsfiddle.net/doc-testing-on-mobile
[07:49:49] <aaronmcadam> why was there a change to ui-collapsible-content to add the theme class as well?
[09:00:44] <_nickel> kinblas: scottjehl: gseguin: working on my mobicase preso today ping me if you need anything
[09:01:10] <kinblas> _nickel: okie dokie
[09:01:16] <kinblas> _nickel: when is mobicase?
[09:01:22] <_nickel> kinblas: 27th
[09:01:38] <_nickel> kinblas: did I ever send you an email with the slides for my jqcon boston talk
[09:02:26] <gseguin> _nickel: I'd be interested in those
[09:02:48] <_nickel> gseguin: http://johnbender.github.com/presentation-jsinjs/#1
[09:03:06] <_nickel> there are three blank slides at the start where images should be I need to sort out why that is
[09:03:21] <_nickel> other than that everything is in there
[09:03:32] <_nickel> when you get to the "jackie?" slide click "jackie?"
[09:03:41] <_nickel> and the qunit slides can be refreshed to run the tests
[09:03:45] <_nickel> its just an iframe
[09:04:59] <gseguin> _nickel: thanks! I'll take a look
[09:05:20] <_nickel> gseguin: I don't put much content on the slides
[09:05:23] <_nickel> I think thats bad form
[09:05:31] <_nickel> so feel free to ask questions
[09:05:47] <gseguin> it's better this way
[09:05:54] <gseguin> I'm interested in the outline
[09:07:35] <gseguin> _nickel: no PhantomJS, heh?
[09:07:45] <_nickel> gseguin: I only have 30 mins :(
[09:07:51] <gseguin> oh ok
[09:07:55] <_nickel> gseguin: I'm missing like half of the content that I want to talk about
[09:08:01] <_nickel> including command line testing the dom
[09:08:04] <_nickel> jasmine examples
[09:08:05] <_nickel> et
[09:08:06] <_nickel> etc
[09:08:21] <_nickel> I want to cover solutions that people can use REALLY easily
[09:08:22] <_nickel> right away
[09:08:34] <gseguin> looks good
[09:09:19] <_nickel> gseguin: in about 7 slides I have a fully functioning js testing setup *without* fixtures that includes CI integration
[09:09:54] <_nickel> similar to what we use for our builds
[09:18:17] <scottjehl> mornin
[09:18:20] <scottjehl> sorta
[09:18:22] <_nickel> scottjehl: :D
[09:18:28] <_nickel> scottjehl: saw the future friendly post
[09:18:31] <_nickel> cool stuff man
[09:18:39] <_nickel> I didn't realize that was what you were doing
[09:18:40] <scottjehl> oh awesome! glad you liked
[09:18:48] <_nickel> but
[09:18:50] <scottjehl> yeah, after breaking development conf
[09:18:51] <_nickel> no internet?
[09:18:58] <scottjehl> only a little
[09:19:08] <_nickel> stir crazy nerds
[09:19:28] <scottjehl> good writeup here http://globalmoxie.com/blog/future-friendly-mobilewood.shtml
[09:20:15] <scottjehl> yeah - between the globe launching, that conf, and mobilewood/futurefriend.ly, that was an insanely busy week
[09:20:43] <scottjehl> glad to be back hacking on bugs with headphones on :)
[09:26:47] <_nickel> scottjehl: "wired in" ;)
[09:46:40] <gseguin> scottjehl: no love for RequireJS? ;)
[09:47:05] <scottjehl> gseguin: oh no I'm fine with whatever you guys think is fast and easy for this
[09:47:08] <scottjehl> simple too
[09:47:56] <gseguin> so the thing I like about AMD is that for debug (in exploded mode) you don't need the php we currently have
[09:48:07] <gseguin> that concatenates
[09:48:35] <gseguin> so you get to put your breakpoint at the same line number you're going to edit your file at
[09:48:40] <gseguin> that's one thing
[09:48:56] <gseguin> it also frees us from PHP
[09:50:37] <gseguin> scottjehl: do we want that for 1.0?
[09:50:47] <scottjehl> well, whatever works really. I think PHP would be pretty simple for this - we already have php concatenation running if we needed it. It'd be ideal if the make file were involved though
[09:51:06] <scottjehl> that's already set up to concat, min, etc
[12:22:29] <eddiemonge> out of curiosity, does jquery core get cached on mobiles like it does on desktops or is there a good chance it isnt cached most of the time?
[12:52:03] <toddmparker> Hi all
[13:00:58] <scottjehl> hey
[13:01:13] <scottjehl> kinblas is this still an issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/530
[13:01:14] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #530 on jquery-mobile, reported by justind000 (9m, 4w ago): PhoneGap -> Blackberry ANT file name issues
[13:02:52] <scottjehl> I see no dashes in our file names
[13:02:54] <scottjehl> looks fine to me
[13:04:39] <kinblas> scottjehl: That's a suck-o bug
[13:04:55] <kinblas> guys can you rename all your files because this platofrm has a broken tool?
[13:05:35] <scottjehl> ohh it's our build file names
[13:10:41] <eddiemonge> invalid. changing our filenames would be a hassle, not to mention breaking all the existing links
[13:14:56] <kinblas> scottjehl: oh ok, so it's potentially only 3 files? js, css, and icons?
[13:15:27] <kinblas> eddiemonge: yeah I think it's lame
[13:23:10] <toddmparker> kinblas: this looks bad: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2493
[13:23:11] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2493 on jquery-mobile, reported by MauriceG (4m, 10s ago): pre-inserted selectmenus-dialog-pages not removed from dom
[13:23:35] <toddmparker> can you take a look? seems we're not cleaning these select pages up
[13:23:49] <toddmparker> if _nickel is a better person to tackle, please re-assign
[13:24:20] <kinblas> toddmparker: yeah, sounds like something _nickel had to deal with for nested lists .. but this time for selects
[13:24:29] <toddmparker> scottjehl: from what I gather, the newer version of BB's tools handle these filenames
[13:24:47] <toddmparker> PhoneGap needs to update to support the newer webworks
[13:25:13] <toddmparker> I asked Brian and he said he has a lot of complaints, but wasn't clear on when they would do this
[13:25:26] <toddmparker> kinblas: should i assign to _nickel
[13:25:56] <toddmparker> made the executive decision there, _nickel it's yours
[13:26:03] <toddmparker> since you just went thru this
[13:26:54] <toddmparker> scottjehl: i think we could close as wontfix?
[13:27:00] <toddmparker> other people's crap tools
[13:27:05] <kinblas> lol
[13:27:38] <toddmparker> kinblas: you sure did wack a lot of deprecated stuff
[13:27:50] <toddmparker> writing it up now for the blog/release notes
[13:28:05] <kinblas> toddmparker: this week's blog/fix list should be juicy
[13:28:28] <toddmparker> you bet, especially b/c i missed last week's
[13:28:32] <kinblas> lol
[13:29:57] <toddmparker> you guys are cranking on bugs
[13:30:05] <eddiemonge> second 530 as wontfix, especialyl since all other jquery properties use dashes
[13:30:09] <toddmparker> scott closed a lot fo cruft today
[13:30:34] <toddmparker> keep your eyes open for stuff that is just plain old or not relevant
[13:49:43] <eddiemonge> what version of the UI widget is actually being included? the file has @VERSION instead of an actual version number
[13:52:50] <eddiemonge> also can someone pull in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2495 and then close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2494?
[13:52:51] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no issue found
[13:52:51] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (45.812s ago): Issue 2494: Removed accidental css cruft and git info reorder
[14:05:01] <toddmparker> my fingers are tired from all the copying and pasting of bug fixes
[14:05:08] <toddmparker> holy smokes
[15:02:43] <_nickel> toddmparker: yah buddy!
[15:03:07] <_nickel> toddmparker: also I'm happy to deal with that issue
[18:53:09] <toddmparker> thanks _nickel
[21:32:10] <nickel> kinblas: do you have problems with the ios 5 crashing the simulator?
[23:17:19] <kinblas> _nickel: I believe iOS5 worked fine for me, but I haven't used it heavily
