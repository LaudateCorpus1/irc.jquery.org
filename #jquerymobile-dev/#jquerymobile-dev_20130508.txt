[06:42:55] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[06:42:57] <uGoMobi> and arschmitz 
[06:43:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: didn't you already open a ticket for that?
[06:43:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5855
[06:49:35] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: oops, you're right. closed the new one.
[06:49:40] <toddmparker> the search in github is bad
[06:58:45] <foo> Anyone have any tips to simulate website capture on an iphone/android device? I want to, say, write a script that captures 5 websites we have done for portfolio usage
[07:02:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just closed 5 event issues!
[07:02:30] <arschmitz> including that old annoying delegated swipe one
[07:02:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw that.. nice!!
[07:02:46] <arschmitz> that was a nightmare to figure out!
[07:02:54] <arschmitz> took me like a day and a half lol
[07:02:55] <uGoMobi> we should do an event to celebrate ;)

[07:05:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what do you thing about making fire tap on taphold an option
[07:05:28] <arschmitz> we cant make it the default the way the ticket / pr wants but we can make it an option
[07:05:57] <arschmitz> would have to be a global config though
[07:06:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I have to read the comments in the ticket why it is an issue
[07:07:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3803
[07:09:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: does tap fire before taphold?
[07:09:38] <uGoMobi> sorry... I mean the other way around
[07:09:53] <uGoMobi> that's what the OP said
[07:10:17] <toddmparker> arschmitz: rokk
[07:11:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: most of the time its not guranteed
[07:12:02] <arschmitz> tap fires when you let off
[07:12:10] <arschmitz> taphold fires after a timeout
[07:13:14] <arschmitz> toddmparker: also add the teardown methods to all the touch events so they work with unbind and off
[07:13:20] <arschmitz> which was a 1.4 item
[07:13:29] <arschmitz> and its completely done now
[07:14:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: id say it does probably 99% of the time
[07:14:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think that if it's not possible to do two different things on tap and taphold now across all platforms, we should provide a solution
[07:14:54] <toddmparker> arschmitz: man, great work
[07:15:12] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: should or shouldn't?
[07:15:49] <uGoMobi> should
[07:16:38] <uGoMobi> I mean that if you can't write code now that does different things on tap and taphold, we should make it possible
[07:17:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i tend to agree we will just have to make it an option to maintain backcompat
[07:17:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes I agree we have to avoid breaking chance
[07:18:45] <arschmitz> ok i think ill just go ahead and add the option im already in there for all these other event changes it will only take a few minutes
[07:20:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: any ideas on a better name then emitTapOnTaphold
[07:20:19] <arschmitz> seems a bit much to me lol
[07:20:33] <uGoMobi> hmm
[07:21:14] <uGoMobi> not really
[07:21:21] <arschmitz> ok 
[07:21:44] <uGoMobi> only a longer name ... preventTapOnTaphold
[07:21:46] <arschmitz> its not something you would ever write more then once anyway lo
[07:21:56] <arschmitz> since its global

[12:53:33] <agcolom> gnarf: cc: Thanks for fixing the issue with that php file. cc: scott_gonzalez 
[12:54:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I think I know what the problem is with the loadPage example.
[12:55:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The code in the example gets placed into a window.onload function.
[12:55:11] <agcolom> yes
[12:55:28] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: By the time that function gets called, the pageinit event has likely already happened.
[12:55:35] <agcolom> right
[12:55:41] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So that handler never gets called.
[12:55:45] <agcolom> ok
[12:55:54] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I dunno why it wraps things into window.onload.
[12:56:26] <agcolom> that's something that is used for all the sites... 
[12:56:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I remember asking this before, but unfortunately, I don't remember the answer: Why must code in examples be wrapped into a window.onload handler?
[12:56:40] <agcolom> maybe I could defer it my using a button...
[12:57:28] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: You could avoid the whole pageinit thing and just hook up to the buttons directly - unfortunately, then the example is wrong, because we /do/ want people to hook up during pageinit.
[12:57:50] <agcolom> ok, I get you...
[12:57:55] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: However, the example as shown on the page is not the same as the example rendered in the iframe, because of this window.onload wrapping.
[12:58:09] <agcolom> indeed... 
[12:58:15] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, basically we're lying to our viewers.
[12:58:59] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: We really need an option for the example generator where we say "please don't wrap my code into a window.onload handler!".
[13:00:01] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I can try to poke around again just to see whether I can set something like that up.
[13:00:53] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: ok, sounds good. Otherwise, I can check with scott_gonzalez tomorrow during our content meeting...
[13:02:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: We've already discussed this once, but, unfortunately, as Einstein once said: "I have a great mind, but it's very short." Well, unlike Einstein's, mine isn't even that great :/
[13:02:37] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I mean scott_gonzalez and I.
[13:02:40] <agcolom> ;-) 
[13:02:53] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: you have a fine mind ;-)
[13:03:05] <_|Nix|_> Thanks ... I try ... 
[13:06:12] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: It works around a bug in IE where the scripts are executed in the wrong order.
[13:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov had a suggestion for a different workaround, but I haven't tried it yet.
[13:07:05] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: gnarf fixed the issue with php... not sure what it was but the example is working fine now.
[13:07:10] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Oh, that's right.
[13:07:41] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Wait a sec - if you don't wrap in onload, is there a chance the script will run before jQuery is even loaded?
[13:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: yup
[13:08:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: After all, jQM goes to great lengths to work on IE and everywhere else ... so, is this issue restricted to iframes in IE?
[13:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> IE executes scripts in load order, so the inline script executes before the external scripts.
[13:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's restricted to document.write()'d iframes.
[13:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> I hate that we even have this problem.
[13:08:55] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I see, so that's why all of jQuery and friends is not b0rked on IE.
[13:09:52] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: What about placing the code into an external reference?
[13:10:07] <scott_gonzalez> So, Mike's suggestion was instead of document.write()ing the script, inject a script which itself document.write()s the script.
[13:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> We can do that to, but it would add more requests, and require more up-front parsing and file generation.
[13:10:57] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Not bad, and then the script can remove itself when its job's done.
[13:29:52] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: oh i hate that iframe bug in ie has caused me much headach using iframes in a dialog in ui. 
[13:38:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This is only happening on IE7/8/9, right? I mean, this script execution order thing, right?
[13:39:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If so, then why do we care? This is the API docs, not end-user stuff ... we can assume that devs are not constrained to IE7/8/9 ... 
[13:39:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Tbes
[13:39:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry ...
[13:39:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The stuff they create might be restricted, but not their dev environment.
[13:39:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think its actually only 8,9 and not sure about ten
[13:40:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Either way, we should be able to specify that it shouldn't be wrapped in window.onload.
[13:40:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can let the API docs break on oldIE, because it's aimed at devs, not users.
[13:40:49] <arschmitz> lol 
[13:41:17] <arschmitz> yeah i can see your point im not so sure they are going to be willing to go that route though
[13:42:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: All I'm asking for is the option.
[13:42:30] <arschmitz> oh actually that i frame error isnt even 8 i think its just 9 and maybe 10
[13:43:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, great, so it's the /later/ versions that are dain-bramaged, not the earlier ones! Emphatic thumbs up!
[13:43:24] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:43:33] <arschmitz> i ran into this a while back had almost forgotten about it
[13:43:45] <arschmitz> when ie9 came out it totally broke a bunch of pages i had
[13:44:00] <arschmitz> had some iframes in ui dialogs
[13:44:19] <arschmitz> and that turns out to be a big NO NO for ie9 ( though i think ui has fixed that now)
[13:44:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I guess there's no good way around it ...
[13:45:15] <arschmitz> i found one that worked for me at the time but i dont recal what it was it was something i remeber thinking was BAD though and i didnt like it one bit
[13:45:49] <arschmitz> took the quick fix to fix issue and immeditly started working on a refactor to avoide the whole situation
[13:45:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: According to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9527582/write-some-html-and-js-to-a-iframe-not-working-in-ie-is-not-defined IE7/8/9 are affected.
[13:46:24] <arschmitz> hmm not sure i only recall it on 9 but this was quite a while back
[13:46:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm feeling masochistic ... I think I'll check it out with browserstack ...
[13:47:10] <arschmitz> either way its totally busted with no good solution 
[13:48:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm wondering if the solution mikesherov mentioned to scott_gonzalez might work ...
[13:48:36] <arschmitz> yeah that sounded reasonable 
[13:49:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have the nagging suspicion it won't - well, it will work, but it'll be no good to us, because it'll have the same effect as wrapping in window.onload.
[13:49:24] <arschmitz> what exactly is the problem i missed that part
[13:50:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: inline scripts run before externally referred-to scripts, so $ is not defined when you try to $( document ).on( "pageinit", "#page1", function() {} );
[13:50:58] <arschmitz> oh i remember the workaround i hated oh it was bad i just used a set timeout for like a week until i refactored!
[13:51:17] <arschmitz> not helpful at all lol
[13:51:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ouch!
[13:52:10] <arschmitz> yeah it was temp and i needed it working right that second sort of thing
[13:52:29] <arschmitz> and forsome reason window.onload was not an option
[13:53:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! Really? Is there any way you can look up what you did?
[13:53:20] <arschmitz> maybe 
[13:53:46] <arschmitz> the site does not exist in that form anymore but it might be way back in the reaches of github
[13:54:09] <arschmitz> its around the time i started using github so it may or maynot be there
[13:58:27] <arschmitz> oh bummer yeah load time was not an issue in this case so i just made the script external
[13:58:38] <arschmitz> so no inline scripts no issues
[13:58:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so not really helpful here
[14:00:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: kinda seems like pageinit should be a deffered so then if its already happened it executes immeditly rather then being missed completely?
[14:00:24] <arschmitz> probably to big of a change for just this
[14:00:30] <arschmitz> but in general could be useful
[14:00:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I dunno, because this is the generic .on() mechanism, so it can happen more than once.
[14:01:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... even for the same page.
[14:01:07] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:01:32] <arschmitz> hmmm
[14:03:43] <arschmitz> im trying to think of some workaround but nothing that makes sense is coming to mind that will gurantee its there before pageinit
[14:04:11] <arschmitz> oh
[14:04:34] <arschmitz> what if we trigger pageinit at the end of the window.onload
[14:05:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: then we cant miss it 
[14:14:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im heading home but will be back on in a bit
[14:30:00] <_|Nix|_> OK ... the weirdest thing: In Chrome 26, if you document.write('<script>alert("abc");</script>'); You get unexpected token ILLEGAL. However, if you document.write( '<script>alert("abc");</script' + '>' ); It works fine.
[14:30:19] <_|Nix|_> Seems to be a parser error.
[14:40:41] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Not sure if this is what mikesherov meant, but this sure is weird: http://gabrielschulhof.github.io/test-pages/old-iframe-script.html
[14:41:13] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: If you load it, you get false for !!window.jQuery. If you reload it, you get true, followed by false. *shake head*
[15:44:26] <toddmparker> Man, my life is meetings. What did I miss?
[15:45:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: IE sux0rz, but that's old hat.
[15:46:10] <toddmparker> Heh, just reading up on that
[15:46:29] <toddmparker> Just iframes?
[15:47:35] <toddmparker> On a train, going to lose my interwebs...
[16:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Yup, I think that's what he was suggesting.
[16:18:33] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess it won't help :-(
