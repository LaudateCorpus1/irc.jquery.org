[08:53:48] <gseguin> morning all
[08:54:57] <johnbender> toddparker: I can take that nav bug
[09:04:24] <johnbender> toddparker: kinblas: I'm going to take that nav bug
[09:04:34] <johnbender> unless something else is pressing
[09:04:38] <toddparker> hi gseg
[09:04:44] <toddparker> gseguin!
[09:04:53] <gseguin> 'ssssssup!
[09:05:03] <toddparker> how goes it in baby town?
[09:05:15] <gseguin> pretty good
[09:05:15] <johnbender> seriously
[09:05:20] <toddparker> johnbender: which nav bug?
[09:05:23] <gseguin> grandma's here to help mama
[09:05:31] <toddparker> ah, always a good thing
[09:05:31] <johnbender> toddparker: the disabling issue

[09:06:13] <toddparker> that would be super
[09:06:28] <toddparker> once you get this sorted, I'd like to add this to the docs
[09:15:04] <kinblas> toddparker: johnbender: I updated issue 2725 with a comment
[09:16:57] <kinblas> toddparker: I really think we need config switches that turn off click hijacking and hash handling
[09:17:20] <kinblas> for post 1.0, I was going to take a stab at decoupling the hash handling from the page loading
[09:17:27] <kinblas> page loading/navigation that is
[09:29:44] <johnbender> kinblas: if( !$.mobile.ajaxEnabled && !path.isEmbeddedPage( href ) )
[09:29:55] <johnbender> I'm wondering if that && should be an ||
[09:30:01] <johnbender> errr
[09:30:02] <johnbender> nevermind
[09:30:04] <johnbender> lol
[09:31:06] <johnbender> !$.mobile.ajaxEnabled || path.isEmbeddedPage( href )
[09:32:50] <kinblas> johnbender: did you see my comment in the issue?
[09:33:10] <johnbender> kinblas: newp
[09:33:12] <johnbender> looking now
[09:34:18] <johnbender> hmm
[09:34:50] <johnbender> I didn't look to deeply at his example link I though he was referencing external pages
[09:34:53] <johnbender> *too
[09:35:49] <johnbender> hrm
[09:36:11] <kinblas> his example is using #foo
[09:36:20] <kinblas> I think he's using backbone to generate an 'embedded' page
[09:36:25] <johnbender> yah
[09:36:29] <kinblas> which is why we let our normal course of action happen
[09:36:43] <kinblas> what he really needs is a don't hijack-me-links switch
[09:36:51] <johnbender> yep
[09:36:52] <kinblas> </pirate>
[09:37:04] <johnbender> lol
[09:37:12] <johnbender> which is rel=external right now
[09:37:18] <johnbender> though that's obviously not right
[09:37:37] <kinblas> right, he had to use rel=external to get around the problem
[09:37:57] <kinblas> so as I mentioned above we need a big config switch
[09:38:00] <kinblas> *also*
[09:38:17] <kinblas> I think we need to have some attribute that allows us to say, don't hijack anything within this container
[09:38:25] <kinblas> then folks can import random widgets
[09:38:33] <kinblas> without us busting them
[09:39:45] <johnbender> $(":not(:jqmData(ignore-clicks)) a") or some such
[09:39:54] <johnbender> for the link binding
[09:41:30] <johnbender> kinblas: feature request? he can use rel=external for now eh?
[09:42:10] <kinblas> johnbender: having to write out rel="external" on *every* link is lame ... we should've added a config option
[09:42:34] <kinblas> we should add one
[09:42:35] <kinblas> for 1.0
[09:42:42] <kinblas> it's minimal risk really
[09:42:57] <kinblas> just check the config option at the top of the click hijack function
[09:42:59] <kinblas> and bail
[09:44:23] <johnbender> fair enough
[09:48:18] <toddparker> I agree that's lame
[09:48:28] <eddiemonge> lame
[09:48:33] <toddparker> I thought shutting off ajax nav would prevent us from hijacking?
[09:49:00] <toddparker> i agree we need to fix this
[09:49:20] <toddparker> either by automatically not hijacking if ajax is disabled or by adding a new global config option
[09:49:40] <toddparker> what does disabling ajax nav do if we're still hijacking?
[09:50:45] <toddparker> kinblas, johnbender, ghislain ^^
[09:50:55] <toddparker> gseguin:
[09:51:39] <kinblas> toddparker: this is an issue I raised prior to rc1
[09:51:48] <kinblas> what exactly does "ajaxEnabled" mean?
[09:51:58] <toddparker> yeah? what did we conclude then?
[09:52:05] <kinblas> the answer I got back was that it only pertained to pulling in external pages
[09:52:15] <kinblas> internal/embedded pages are not affected by the option
[09:52:23] <kinblas> so that's how I fixed the problem
[09:52:31] <toddparker> I think that part makes sesne
[09:52:38] <toddparker> is is called ajax
[09:52:41] <kinblas> but I think the issue here
[09:52:49] <kinblas> is that he wants to totally disable link handling
[09:52:56] <toddparker> so do we need another option to shut off the inner page navigation behavior?
[09:52:58] <kinblas> which is something we hear over and over
[09:53:07] <kinblas> folks just want the pretty jqm visuals
[09:53:27] <kinblas> and they don't want us to dork with their hashes and hijack their links
[09:53:31] <toddparker> yeah
[09:53:48] <toddparker> so do we need to add a localNav option to kill handling for local pages
[09:54:05] <toddparker> or a super global "don't mess with my links"
[09:54:36] <kinblas> I think the latter, combined with ajaxEnabled will satisfy most folks
[09:54:39] <toddparker> well nav is decoupled, right? in theory they can just kill the nav files and make a build?
[09:54:54] <kinblas> not really
[09:55:04] <kinblas> nav makes calls to location.hash
[09:55:07] <kinblas> which is bad
[09:55:20] <kinblas> what we should be doing is making a notification event
[09:55:24] <kinblas> "hey my page changed"
[09:55:29] <kinblas> and then let whatever is listening
[09:55:33] <kinblas> handle it appropriately
[09:55:43] <kinblas> for us that default thing listening would be our hash/pushstate
[09:55:45] <kinblas> plugins
[09:56:07] <toddparker> gotcha
[09:56:22] <toddparker> look, i'm good with making a chance here if it's not too risky
[09:56:39] <kinblas> I think the global hijack switch is something we need ... +1
[09:56:44] <toddparker> i was thinking that navigation behavior could be nixed easily, sounds like that' s not the case
[09:56:48] <toddparker> +1
[09:57:00] <kinblas> toddparker: post 1.0 it will :-D
[09:57:11] <toddparker> johnbender, gseguin ?
[09:57:27] <toddparker> kinblas: you're surging we land this now tho right?
[09:57:45] <kinblas> lol ...you must be on an iOS device
[09:57:55] <kinblas> "surging" --> "suggesting"
[09:57:56] <kinblas> ??
[09:58:09] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, minimal risk, big upside for folks
[09:58:22] <toddparker> Lion
[09:58:26] <toddparker> same idea tho
[09:58:34] <toddparker> they auto-correct like crazy
[09:58:39] <kinblas> toddparker: also post 1.0, I think we need to be able to mark a container and say, don't hijack anything underneath this container ... it will allow folks to pull in external widgets
[09:58:46] <toddparker> tho that's good, i'm a terrible typist
[09:58:56] <kinblas> heh
[09:59:07] <toddparker> ok, i say make it so
[09:59:17] <kinblas> johnbender: ^^^^
[09:59:49] <toddparker> silence = yes? heh
[09:59:53] <kinblas> heh
[10:00:07] <toddparker> what to call it?
[10:00:31] <kinblas> hijackLinksEnabled ??
[10:00:32] <toddparker> enableLinkHijax
[10:00:59] <toddparker> linkBehaviorEnabled
[10:01:01] <kinblas> toddparker: also regarding that tweet you forwarded ... any details on the jqm bashing?
[10:01:12] <toddparker> not really
[10:01:16] <kinblas> toddparker: linkBehaviorEnabled would be confusing
[10:01:28] <kinblas> toddparker: I've been seeing a rise in tweets/complaints about
[10:01:38] <johnbender> kinblas: $.mobile.navigationEnabled?
[10:01:43] <toddparker> one guy I asked just said they were probably related to it not doing what people wanted and it being young, but i didn't hear the criticisms
[10:01:52] <toddparker> oh and the "markup bloat"
[10:02:01] <toddparker> which i guess is data-attrs
[10:02:08] <toddparker> i need to doc that these are 100% optional
[10:02:27] <toddparker> be back in a few
[10:02:50] <kinblas> toddparker: oh, ok, I was just wondering if it was related to the twitter trend of folks discussing how difficult PE is and how it sometimes stifles innovation
[10:05:12] <gseguin> toddparker: what's up?
[10:05:25] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm always in favor of naming what it does ... if the check is going in the click handler then it should mention that ... folks will still be able to use the navigation stuff
[10:05:46] <kinblas> ... but they'll have to call it manually.
[10:05:53] <johnbender> kinblas: what about forms?
[10:06:08] <kinblas> ooh good one
[10:06:13] <kinblas> yeah we need a switch for that
[10:06:16] <kinblas> folks have been wanting that too
[10:06:21] <gseguin> toddparker: sorry missed it, it was above, not below
[10:06:31] <kinblas> johnbender: forgot about that one
[10:06:41] <johnbender> kinblas: people will probably want an option for each
[10:06:46] <johnbender> so my suggestions is still por
[10:06:47] <johnbender> *poor
[10:06:53] <johnbender> *suggestion
[10:07:00] * johnbender cannot type for beans
[10:07:55] <kinblas> hijaxLinksEnabled, hijaxFormSubmitEnabled ?
[10:08:01] <kinblas> or hijaxSubmitEnabled?
[10:08:06] * kinblas shrugs
[10:15:31] <johnbender> kinblas: setting hijaxLinksEnabled next to ajaxEnabled is going to seem weird
[10:16:07] <kinblas> ... well ... one has to do with intercepting link clicks
[10:16:16] <kinblas> the other is more of ... do we handle ajax requests or not
[10:16:28] <kinblas> .. but yeah I can see folks getting confused
[10:16:50] <kinblas> especially since the hijax means we won't be doing the ajax stuff automatically
[10:18:01] <johnbender> sigh
[10:18:22] <kinblas> johnbender: I think the little wrinkle in all this
[10:18:26] <kinblas> is that you can shut off ajax
[10:18:38] <kinblas> but still want the nice transitions when you click on a link that refers to an embedded
[10:18:39] <kinblas> page
[10:18:50] <johnbender> indeed
[10:19:11] <kinblas> ajaxEnabled is just what it says right now, we won't bring in any external pages automatically for you
[10:19:42] <kinblas> johnbender: btw, is that ajaxEnabled also applied to the form submit hijacking we do?
[10:19:46] * kinblas checks
[10:20:08] <johnbender> yah
[10:20:39] <kinblas> ok ... so then we can nix the hijaxForm thingie
[10:20:46] <kinblas> or should we?
[10:20:48] <kinblas> :-)
[10:21:01] <johnbender> we certainly can for now
[10:21:11] <johnbender> trying to think of something to do here that won't be confusing
[10:21:13] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm trying to balance confusion with switch-happiness
[10:21:18] <johnbender> indeed
[10:21:33] <kinblas> I meant being-switch-happy
[10:22:04] <kinblas> johnbender: though there were complaints when we merged the 2 things
[10:22:16] <kinblas> the ajax + form-submit into ajaxEnabled
[10:23:50] <johnbender> one thing that makes it a tad more sucky is that the nav options are in the global mobile namespace
[10:24:03] * johnbender grumbles about "global" and "mobile" rhyming
[10:24:08] <kinblas> lol
[10:32:33] <johnbender> kinblas: ok I'm going to ask my original question
[10:32:44] <johnbender> ( !$.mobile.ajaxEnabled && !path.isEmbeddedPage( href )
[10:32:47] <johnbender> )
[10:33:14] <johnbender> if its embedded can't we just return and let the hashchange handle things?
[10:33:32] <johnbender> that change scaresme
[10:33:44] <johnbender> but in this case that makes sense since he's disabled hash listenting
[10:33:48] <johnbender> *listening
[10:34:05] * johnbender wonders when God will bless him with the ability to type accurately
[10:34:16] <toddparker> hopefully, i get that gift first
[10:34:27] <kinblas> johnbender: so how do pure hashchanges impact the history stack?
[10:34:40] <johnbender> hrm
[10:35:20] <johnbender> kinblas: and moreover it needs to get the transition info etc
[10:35:22] <johnbender> sigh
[10:35:25] * johnbender sighs
[10:36:15] <toddparker> sooo...
[10:36:27] <toddparker> is this one really tricky
[10:36:30] <johnbender> no
[10:36:39] <toddparker> oh, ok
[10:36:40] <johnbender> I just hate the idea of adding ANOTHER nav config option
[10:36:46] <toddparker> your sighs make me nervous
[10:37:04] <johnbender> it's turning into an exceedingly ugly api
[10:37:04] <toddparker> people love options!
[10:38:13] <toddparker> yeah
[10:38:47] <johnbender> it also us binds us to supporting that option in the future which means any kind of refactor is going to be harder
[10:41:24] <johnbender> kinblas: in that regard adding another data attribute that would prevent the binding in the first place would be better
[10:41:34] <toddparker> del,, there probably should be a "leave everything alone" option no matter what
[10:41:46] <toddparker> well ^
[10:42:19] <johnbender> toddparker: well it't not a quite a "leave everything alone" because people might still want the forms to be handled via ajax etc
[10:43:23] <kinblas> johnbender: but that is handled by the ajaxEnabled config ... this is more about don't hijack my links
[10:44:01] <johnbender> right
[10:45:04] <johnbender> I guess I'm referring more to the fact that it might still be confusing because the option won't handle leaving the forms alone
[10:45:15] <johnbender> $.leaveLinksAlone
[10:45:17] <johnbender> err
[10:45:23] <johnbender> $.mobile.leaveLinksAlone
[10:45:45] <johnbender> kinblas: in this case it it just ignoring embedded pages?
[10:45:53] <johnbender> people probably still want the highlight clicks too eh?
[10:46:03] * johnbender sighs
[10:46:37] <johnbender> unless you mean that the return should only happen in the "click" and not the "vclick"
[10:46:59] <kinblas> hmmm... if they shut off our click handlng, then they will have to deal
[10:47:13] <kinblas> toddparker: is that too hard of a stance?
[10:47:18] <toddparker> deal with handling the visual feedabck
[10:47:21] <kinblas> yeah
[10:47:38] <kinblas> otherwise we can't turn it off for them, because they said not to execute our handler
[10:47:46] <toddparker> right
[10:47:58] <toddparker> so we used to have ajax forms and links
[10:48:01] <toddparker> then we combined them
[10:48:12] <toddparker> (some people weren't happy)
[10:48:14] <kinblas> toddparker: then some folks complained
[10:48:27] <toddparker> but I think we should just have a single option to shut it all off
[10:48:33] <toddparker> and not break it up
[10:48:40] <toddparker> yeah, i know
[10:49:21] <toddparker> but if the use case here is for people who are doing lots of complex stuff like backbone, can't they handle the ajax form stuff them selves if they need to?
[10:49:46] <toddparker> guessing MVC frameworks sort of take control of everything
[10:51:24] <toddparker> ultimately, i'dd defer to you guys on what API you think makes sense here
[10:51:31] <kinblas> toddparker: I don't think so ... they just set up things so that if you model changes, the view code auto-runs to reflect changes
[10:51:46] <toddparker> i do think we need to add this and so whatever is cleanerst and least risky/disruptive is goo to me
[10:52:15] <toddparker> so kinblas, you think having a forma nd link option is better?
[10:52:24] <johnbender> kinblas: that's technically just a kvo but most MVC's are used for that
[10:52:29] <johnbender> that's how I understand it
[10:52:45] <toddparker> can you turn the form option on per form with attr or JS if you disable globally?
[10:53:14] <kinblas> toddparker: not right now
[10:53:21] <kinblas> it's all or nothing
[10:54:26] <kinblas> toddparker: actually, it's you can shut it all off, or selectively shut of a particular form
[10:54:29] <kinblas> we don't have the reverse
[10:54:45] <kinblas> which would be shut it all off and selectively turn on
[10:55:44] <toddparker> right, just checking
[10:55:49] <toddparker> i figured that would be the case
[10:56:07] <toddparker> so where are we on this decision-wise?
[10:56:15] <johnbender> kinblas: can we just namespace our bindings and tell people to unbind them :(
[10:56:49] <kinblas> johnbender: that seems a bit hackier though
[10:57:03] <johnbender> kinblas: by rights we should be namespacing them anyway
[10:57:34] <johnbender> kinblas: adding more options for corner cases is hacky too though
[10:58:09] <kinblas> johnbender: hmmm, I guess I don't consider it a corner case because of the number of folks I've seen asking for this in the forums and issues
[10:58:22] <kinblas> over the last year
[10:58:40] <kinblas> it falls into that ajaxEnabled category for me
[10:58:48] <kinblas> a switch for some big piece of the framework
[10:58:55] <toddparker> yeah, i think this is a pretty common thing
[10:59:09] <toddparker> i always assumed that it was easy to flip off all our click handling
[10:59:21] <toddparker> rther, i though ajax did that
[10:59:28] <kinblas> johnbender: I guess I'm not sure what your major objection is ... I get the API concern
[10:59:28] <toddparker> but i understand the distinction
[10:59:56] <kinblas> johnbender: personally I too feel that some parts of the "API" are a bit ad-hoc
[11:00:38] <toddparker> some were admittedly
[11:00:45] <kinblas> but I think folks have been reluctant to change things because folks have been using/deploying so early on in the project
[11:01:06] <kinblas> that now we're stuck with them to avoid breaking them ... and I think that's where you're at with this switch right?
[11:01:39] <johnbender> kinblas: yes I don't want to support another switch
[11:02:02] <toddparker> that was definitely a big factor…we've had a ton of people using this since alpha which make it harder to change things
[11:02:04] <johnbender> I'd like to allow people to extend/alter the software in a normal sane way
[11:02:07] <johnbender> extension
[11:02:08] <johnbender> events
[11:02:09] <johnbender> etc
[11:02:09] <toddparker> heck, i woulda killed nested lists
[11:02:29] <johnbender> kinblas: and I think we can do that post 1.0
[11:02:32] <kinblas> johnbender: so what's more sane than saying turn off your hijacking?
[11:02:34] <toddparker> agree on that johnbender
[11:02:49] <toddparker> that does seem like a pretty clear switch
[11:03:03] <kinblas> johnbender: having someone go in and un-register your event handlers out from underneath the framework seems a bit more
[11:03:05] <johnbender> kinblas: if I was re-writting or in the current situation
[11:03:08] <toddparker> and one that should be built-in, not something you can roll yourself
[11:03:10] <kinblas> prone to problems
[11:03:45] <toddparker> what ideal (for later) and what can we do now, since we're at RC stage
[11:03:51] <johnbender> kinblas: that may not be the best solution here I'm just looking to avoid adding another option
[11:04:16] <johnbender> so for now I don't know that we have another option, I'm only proposing _anything_ other than adding it
[11:04:27] <johnbender> to me its clunky one way or another
[11:04:37] <johnbender> so I'm looking for the clunky way that won't tie our hands later
[11:04:46] <johnbender> or at least has the loosest knot
[11:05:08] <johnbender> (not saying the event namespacing is that"
[11:05:09] <johnbender> )
[11:05:50] <toddparker> what would be other ways to make this work w/o namespacing
[11:06:11] <johnbender> selector
[11:06:17] <kinblas> honestly, the loosest knot would be to either (a) make the handler public so folks can monkeypatch to do whatever they like, or (b) add  callback that they can register to say yay or nay, (c) add a config option
[11:06:36] <johnbender> kinblas: that first was the best possible scenario
[11:06:54] <johnbender> if we can get this huge set of closure's and functions into a manageable set of objects
[11:07:19] <johnbender> we can split out/centralize the different bits and form a real api
[11:07:31] <johnbender> which can be used to alter specific stages of the process
[11:07:37] <kinblas> amen
[11:08:20] <johnbender> alright
[11:08:23] <johnbender> too much discussion already
[11:08:42] <johnbender> I say we either do a selector to allow people to opt out via a parent element
[11:08:47] <johnbender> or just do the option and call it a day
[11:08:57] <johnbender> the first one is a perf drain
[11:10:27] <kinblas> johnbender: heh, <hat type="perf">then I guess that answers that</hat>
[11:10:55] <johnbender> indeed
[11:11:05] <johnbender> sorry for whinning
[11:11:26] <johnbender> *whining
[11:11:50] <johnbender> I guess on some level it's good to discuss why solid object design is important
[11:20:12] <toddparker> all raid concerns johnbender, let's definitely try to shape this up once 1.0 is out
[11:20:27] <toddparker> so are we back to just tacking in a new option?
[11:23:30] <toddparker> "valid" concerns
[11:27:06] <johnbender> toddparker: I think so
[11:27:13] <johnbender> kinblas: should I take a look at the webview issue
[11:27:22] <johnbender> I need to get phonegap installed anyway
[11:28:06] <kinblas> johnbender: which issue?
[11:28:08] <kinblas> the crasher?
[11:28:13] <kinblas> phonegap crasher that is
[11:28:30] * kinblas welcomes any phonegap help :-D

[12:01:24] <kinblas> toddparker: did you accidentally close 2724?
[12:01:41] <kinblas> whoops I meant 2190

[12:17:15] <toddparker>  now hone you reference an issue, it shows up in the comments and the open/cosed status is there
[12:17:20] <toddparker> confusing, I know
[12:32:38] <johnbender> yah I"m looking at 2190 and I can't get it to reproduce with phonegap
[12:33:05] <toddparker> thiose are such a pain. so many variables

[12:36:58] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (3d, 20h ago): Move CSS files to CSS folder and separate out core to make adding themes
[12:38:40] <toddparker> sure eddiemonge
[12:39:02] <toddparker> could you update the pull so i can be merged cleanly?
[12:39:53] <eddiemonge> does anything on it conflict now?
[12:40:23] <toddparker> on github, it says it can't be auto merged
[12:40:48] <eddiemonge> does it say why or is that all it gives?
[12:41:03] <toddparker> that's all it says
[12:41:13] <toddparker> a bunch of commits rolled in faster this was posted
[12:41:27] <toddparker> question: in /css/there is a core folder
[12:41:38] <toddparker> are there other folders?
[12:41:46] <toddparker> do we need a core folder?
[12:42:18] <eddiemonge> the other folders would be the custom themes
[12:42:37] <toddparker> so what is your did structure for css and themes?
[12:42:41] <eddiemonge> ill test the pull on a clean checkout and see what fails in a merge
[12:43:04] <toddparker> ok
[12:43:10] <toddparker> i'm looking at UI's did structure
[12:43:14] <toddparker> we might want to model that
[12:43:22] <toddparker> or did you already check that?
[12:44:48] <eddiemonge> they have it all rolled up into one as well
[12:45:13] <eddiemonge> although i think they/we should have separate folders to differentiate structure from actual theme
[12:45:17] <toddparker> jquery-ui / themes / base
[12:45:53] <toddparker> so I'm thinking we should have
[12:46:00] <toddparker> css/
[12:46:26] <toddparker> :.. core/
[12:46:35] <toddparker> :.. themes
[12:46:52] <toddparker>    :.. default/
[12:47:01] <toddparker>    :.. valencia/
[12:47:07] <toddparker> is that what you had?
[12:47:33] <toddparker> wait core = structure?
[12:48:06] <toddparker> the CDN rollup of core = jquery.mobile.structure.css
[12:48:26] <toddparker> kinblas, johnbender, gseguin - thoughts?
[12:48:38] <eddiemonge> i agree thats how it should be.
[12:48:58] <eddiemonge> only change i would need to make is to move default and valencia into a themes folder
[12:52:29] <eddiemonge> core or structure as the folder name?
[13:18:39] <johnbender> toddparker: since we have no way to verify if there are styling issues it might be best to wait to post 1.0
[13:18:57] <johnbender> just a thought
[13:27:29] <toddparker> johnbender: meaning things may break if we move the css?
[13:27:44] <toddparker> that was what I wanted to ask you and kinblas about
[13:27:49] <toddparker> - do you see potential issues?
[13:28:17] <toddparker> conversely, if we leave as is and the build script packages up a subset of the files into structure,css, could hat also cause issues?
[13:28:23] <johnbender> I doubt it but "breaking" when it comes to css is much more subtle
[13:28:48] <johnbender> toddparker: it could but we're also providing the original
[13:29:04] <johnbender> I suppose we could do a diff
[13:29:12] <johnbender> to make sure they are the same before and after the commits
[13:29:24] <johnbender> the compiled css that is
[13:30:08] <johnbender> eddiemonge: if we merge that in would you mind doing a diff between the post change compiled version and the pre change compiled version to verify that it's the same
[13:30:15] <johnbender> pre structure seperation would be the best
[13:30:19] <johnbender> I can do it too if you're busy
[13:30:27] <johnbender> since I should really have done that for the structure css
[13:30:37] <eddiemonge> if you can get me the pre-structure change i can do the diff
[13:30:52] <johnbender> eddiemonge: one sec I'll get you the hash
[13:30:57] <eddiemonge> ok good thing you didnt pull my change in yet. it needs a bit of touching up
[13:31:25] <eddiemonge> when did you land the structure changes? like the date? i can grab the css from the nightlies
[13:32:06] <johnbender> eddiemonge: c134acce16fdcb58599e775fc2718b5678fdcecc
[13:32:26] <johnbender> you can do a checkout of the commit before that from the source
[13:32:32] <johnbender> Thu Oct 13 15:28:06
[13:32:34] <johnbender> that's the date
[13:32:58] <johnbender> eddiemonge: 7c34c5dc4b1d76b06c74ebdada2c017281bba1d2
[13:33:03] <johnbender> that's the commit before it I think
[13:33:08] <johnbender> well
[13:33:10] <johnbender> that's the commit
[13:33:18] <johnbender> I need to double check that the diff is what I think its
[13:33:47] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah that second commit I just pasted is before the change
[13:33:50] <johnbender> so you could build there
[13:33:58] <johnbender> save the file
[13:34:03] <johnbender> ie move it
[13:34:07] <johnbender> and then checkout your commits
[13:34:08] <johnbender> build
[13:34:10] <johnbender> and do a diff
[13:34:44] <eddiemonge> ok. gotta finish this clean version first
[13:40:32] <johnbender> toddparker: I think that android closing in phonegap is a seperate issue but I could be wrong
[13:40:44] <johnbender> toddparker: android phonegap closing
[13:40:47] <johnbender> that's what I meant to say
[13:41:13] <toddparker> separate from what johnbender
[13:44:07] <johnbender> from the ios issue

[13:44:51] <johnbender> I can't reproduce the ios issue in phonegap
[13:46:36] <toddparker> ok, cool
[13:46:42] <toddparker> thanks for testing johnbender
[13:47:01] <toddparker> was that on adroid?
[13:47:12] <johnbender> the linked issue?
[13:47:13] <johnbender> yah
[13:47:23] <toddparker> ok, just checking
[13:57:14] <kinblas> toddparker: ping
[13:57:46] <toddparker> hai kinblas
[13:58:00] <kinblas> toddparker: I had thought that all our components were widget-ized ... but apparently some are not, like buttonMarkup ... this makes me wonder if theming is widget specific, or not
[13:58:18] <kinblas> toddparker: just trying to find a home for the getInheritedTheme() util function
[13:58:33] <kinblas> but this whole source builder has me wondering where it should live
[13:58:42] <kinblas> coupled with the fact that things like buttonMarkup aren't formal widgets
[13:58:46] <toddparker> I don't know details, but buttonMarkup is probably a strange case because it's used by a lot of other plugins
[13:59:06] <toddparker> buttonMarkup is sort of a utility
[13:59:22] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, but it still relies on theming
[13:59:28] <toddparker> yeah, sure does
[13:59:39] <kinblas> so perhaps $.mobile.getInheritedTheme() is where it will live?
[13:59:52] <toddparker> i know from talking to scott that theme inheritance it tricky because eof timing
[13:59:52] <kinblas> I was thinking it would be a widget method, but if buttonmarkup isn't widget, it can't live there
[14:00:04] <kinblas> eof?
[14:00:10] <toddparker> of
[14:00:24] <toddparker> is the issue that buttonMarkup isn't int eh widget factory?
[14:00:24] <kinblas> yeah, the problem I'm seeing is that we rely on class names
[14:00:54] <kinblas> toddparker: right button markup isn't a widget, so it wouldn't have access to the getInheritanceMethod if it was part of $.mobile.widget
[14:01:00] <toddparker> right. the theme data attar is sort of a shortcut to apply the classes
[14:01:08] <kinblas> I meant getInhertedTheme method
[14:01:10] <toddparker> but you can also use the classes directly
[14:01:12] <toddparker> i do it a lot
[14:01:21] <toddparker> so that's why classes are the better bet
[14:01:22] <kinblas> yeah, but use of classes
[14:01:26] <toddparker> attrs resolve to classes
[14:01:40] <kinblas> implies that at the time, the body/bar widgets must have been processed already
[14:02:01] <toddparker> right
[14:02:12] <toddparker> hence the timing trickiness
[14:02:17] <kinblas> right
[14:03:01] <toddparker> so what to do?
[14:03:52] <kinblas> toddparker: well I can minimize the timing problem by making sure pages, bars and content are included first ... this means their listeners get triggered first
[14:04:09] <kinblas> ... I have a feeling scott already did this otherwise we would see problems
[14:04:35] <kinblas> toddparker: anyways so I'm just wondering where this method should live ... core? widget?
[14:05:00] <kinblas> like I said its more of  my wondering about how we are going to break things up for the builder
[14:08:12] <toddparker> i wish I was more familiar with the details
[14:08:38] <toddparker> when you say widget, what does that mean?
[14:09:45] <toddparker> it seems like core should understand basic theme inheritance in case someone used core + a 3rd party widget
[14:09:51] <kinblas> toddparker: it means they follow the jquery UI notion of  initialization, etc
[14:10:09] <kinblas> they inherit from a widget base class where they share widget specific utility methods, etc
[14:10:25] <kinblas> toddparker: ah ok, that's good enough then
[14:10:32] <kinblas> I was looking for a reason to put it there :-)
[14:10:58] <toddparker> heh
[14:11:03] <toddparker> it's a possibility, right?
[14:11:05] <kinblas> toddparker: btw, the bottlenecking of the theme inheritance in this method makes oh so much easier to switch everything to "a"
[14:11:16] <kinblas> :-D
[14:11:17] <toddparker> heh, good
[14:11:32] <toddparker> we'll know if this causes big issues for people. our docs will turn black everywhere
[14:11:40] <kinblas> so one of the args to this method is the default theme letter to use if no inheritance is found
[14:11:56] <kinblas> when we want to flip the switch, we just ignore that arg, and it defaults to "a"
[14:12:16] <toddparker> gotcha
[14:13:03] <kinblas> toddparker: thanks for the "excuse" makes me feel better that you said that
[14:13:04] <kinblas> :-)
[14:14:23] <toddparker> i feel scott looking over my shoulder and shaking his head at every decision i make

[14:17:17] <eddiemonge> it was easier that way. plus it looks cleaner
[14:17:42] <eddiemonge> diffs look good too. there are some diffs but its just the normal changes that have happend in the past week
[14:19:14] <toddparker> johnbender: this look ok to you? i know you had concerns about making a change of this scope
[14:21:37] <johnbender> eddiemonge: just to be sure you diffed the compiled files?
[14:21:51] <eddiemonge> yeah, heres a copy of the output: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/919206/Archive.zip
[14:21:55] <johnbender> toddparker: eddiemonge: if they look the same save for a couple lines that can be accounted for from commits
[14:22:01] <johnbender> then I say lets go for it
[14:22:16] <johnbender> have you tested the output for the latest/nightlies/cdn etc?
[14:22:25] <johnbender> I assume you have but I'm just double checking
[14:22:35] <toddparker> good Q
[14:22:44] <toddparker> I'm testing this locally too right now
[14:24:25] <eddiemonge> jquery.mobile-1.0rc2pre.core.css is just core files and jquery.mobile-1.0rc2pre.css is the full core with default theme
[14:25:25] <eddiemonge> heres the css from Oct 12: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/919206/default-theme-Oct-12.zip
[14:25:40] <eddiemonge> if you dont have it already
[14:27:27] <toddparker> eddiemonge: "core" should be "structure"
[14:27:42] <toddparker> because it include all the structural css for all widgets
[14:28:00] <toddparker> there will eventually be a core.css that is just the basics you need w/o widgets
[14:30:21] <toddparker> I just tested that branch and everything looks good
[14:30:29] <toddparker> no issues from what i can see clicking around
[14:31:21] <toddparker> wait eddiemonge - i just cloned your 2700 branch
[14:31:29] <toddparker> and i don't see the structure changes
[14:31:34] <eddiemonge> making them now
[14:31:44] <eddiemonge> you are talking about issue_2700 branch right?
[14:31:51] <toddparker> yeah
[14:31:55] <toddparker> didn't you open pull?
[14:35:59] <eddiemonge> did i what?
[14:37:16] <eddiemonge> ok its all structure now
[14:38:24] <eddiemonge> pull was updated
[14:40:51] <eddiemonge> rwaldron: what do you think about multiple commits in a pull if the commit messages look somehting like this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2728

[14:41:00] <toddparker> anyone think this is a bad idea? set a max-width of dialogs so they don't look like doodoo on larger screens

[14:41:34] <rwaldron> eddiemonge i think thats what git was meant for?
[14:41:59] <eddiemonge> rwaldron: i thought you said at one point you hated multple commits per pull
[14:42:15] <rwaldron> i only have a problem with people combining multiple tickets/issues in one PR
[14:42:28] <rwaldron> most code will require >1 commit
[14:42:30] <rwaldron> :D
[14:43:00] <eddiemonge> ok great. like how i labeled the steps i took? i think it looks pretty
[14:43:18] <toddparker> i agree. multiple commits are good for clarity. but don't fix multiple issues per pull
[14:43:41] <rwaldron> if i was reviewing it, i'd be stoked about commit messages that are labeled clearly.
[14:43:44] <rwaldron> toddparker +9001
[14:44:07] <toddparker> steps are a nice touch eddiemonge
[14:44:28] <toddparker> if  anyone submits a pull for more than one issue, it' will be sent back
[14:44:44] <eddiemonge> toddparker: what are the margin/padding on the dialog at 600px? i think the content should be 600px if possible, instead of the dialog itself
[14:45:07] <toddparker> eddiemonge: not sure
[14:45:14] <toddparker> are you just suggesting ti be a bit wider?
[14:45:41] <Wilto> You mean setting a max width on the entire page, eddiemonge?
[14:45:43] <toddparker> we were going to eyeball it to find a max width that doesn't look nutso
[14:46:02] <eddiemonge> oops then that pull automatically qualifies as a rejection since i also changed `||` to `>` in the make file for the git version because i was tired of think "Git version OR this hash" and liked "Git version OF hash"
[14:46:02] <toddparker> the cover div will be full width/height
[14:46:15] <toddparker> the dialog will be around 600px, centered horizontally
[14:47:07] <eddiemonge> Wilto: no, the content in the dialog. in case someone throws some big chunk of text in there, 600 is like the optimal reading width. less means more scanning back and forth and more means you get lost carriage returning your eyeballs
[14:47:58] <toddparker> yep, that's why the ticket is for
[14:48:08] <toddparker> reasonable line length
[14:49:35] <Wilto> Ah, okay, cool. Agreed, for sure.
[14:50:00] <toddparker> so eddiemonge - is this the right branch to check out?
[14:50:01] <toddparker> https://github.com/eddiemonge/jquery-mobile/tree/issue_2700

[14:54:37] <johnbender> I asked the guy who opened the issue to figure out what the difference was with his project and phonegap because it works fine in phonegap
[14:54:39] <toddparker> so this line:
[14:54:40] <toddparker> If you have python installed (most Linux distributions) and Mac OSX, you use the built-in simple web server. Open a terminal/shell and change to the jQuery Mobile folder then type 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer', and voila you can then browse via http://localhost:8000.
[14:54:47] <johnbender> toddparker: yah take it out
[14:55:30] <johnbender> it would be better if the docs referenced the local build
[14:55:34] <toddparker> edited via github. cool.
[14:55:35] <johnbender> then that would indeed work
[14:55:39] <eddiemonge> could we do a index.py in those directories?
[14:55:47] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yes
[14:55:59] <johnbender> eddiemonge: well actually I don't know how simplehttpserver works
[14:56:05] <johnbender> you'll have to look into it
[14:56:05] <eddiemonge> me neither
[14:56:12] <johnbender> I don't think it will work that way
[14:56:29] <johnbender> php is soft of alone in the "run my page from that actual url"
[14:56:34] <johnbender> *sort of
[14:56:48] <johnbender> other languages tend to prefer routing
[14:56:54] <johnbender> but that's not for certain
[14:57:27] <eddiemonge> of course if we make an exception for python then we need one for ruby, nodejs, .......
[14:57:29] <johnbender> eddiemonge: but I don't want another place where we list the files
[14:57:35] <johnbender> exactly
[14:57:49] <johnbender> the fact that we have a couple build methods has been problems enough
[14:58:04] <johnbender> there's actually a bug for centralizing the deps list
[14:58:20] <johnbender> which may be solved with amd after 1.0 anyway!
[14:59:38] <toddparker> ok all, I'm going to pull in the CSS re-org

[15:00:40] <toddparker> ok
[15:00:53] <eddiemonge> no, i forgot about that
[15:01:05] <eddiemonge> toddparker: are the order of the "structure" css file important?

[15:01:20] <toddparker> order always matters
[15:01:29] <toddparker> theme should be after structure
[15:01:39] <johnbender> toddparker: but within structure
[15:01:58] <toddparker> you mean in the combined file?
[15:02:07] <toddparker> yeah, theme at the end
[15:02:54] <toddparker> actually, it may not matter
[15:02:57] <eddiemonge> right now, in css/structure/index.php, the css files are listed out. we were wondering if we could just grab them all at once for that part, which we can only do if the order doesnt matter
[15:03:02] <toddparker> i see it's first and it's fine
[15:03:08] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/css/themes/default/
[15:03:21] <toddparker> actually, maybe first is better
[15:03:44] <toddparker> thinking of cases where we define something in the theme, then override it in widgets
[15:03:53] <toddparker> so theme first then
[15:04:02] <toddparker> as you were boys
[15:04:41] <eddiemonge> oops, that was an accident. wrong order of the args in the array_merge.
[15:04:52] <toddparker> hat was?
[15:04:54] <toddparker> what
[15:04:55] <eddiemonge> i think theme should come last so it can overwrite structure if needed/wanted
[15:05:37] <toddparker> nah, theme has always been first
[15:05:37] <toddparker> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0rc1/jquery.mobile-1.0rc1.css
[15:05:49] <toddparker> i just had a fuzzy brain
[15:06:13] <toddparker> it's sort of the other way around anyway
[15:06:29] <toddparker> you might say "bar A has a red border"
[15:06:43] <toddparker> and in a widget, say "bars only have a top border, negate the other 3"
[15:07:10] <toddparker> in collapsibles, we add the content class, then negate the gradients to leave the bg color
