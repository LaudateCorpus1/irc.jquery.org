[00:24:07] <agcolom> Hey Jasper, you there?
[00:31:44] <agcolom> uGoMobi ?
[00:32:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne, yes
[00:40:14] <agcolom> Hi, sorry I have been crazy busy at work, so not had a chance to look at your PRs
[00:40:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom: no worries, they dont melt :)
[00:40:56] <agcolom> plus I had a conflict on a file!!! (git is causing me stress!! :-) !)
[00:41:07] <uGoMobi> ai ai
[00:41:11] <agcolom> So I just need
[00:41:31] <uGoMobi> git can be a pain i know
[00:41:32] <agcolom> So i just need to check that file is good now before I can do something
[00:42:12] <uGoMobi> yeah of course, just leave everything until you're sure it's ok to merge again
[00:42:14] <agcolom> the big problem for me is I am learning git as we go along... I have never used it before... just used
[00:42:26] <uGoMobi> i understand
[00:42:43] <uGoMobi> its new to me too
[00:42:54] <agcolom> very basic commands before, so I always need Ghislain's help to sort things out when I make a disaster!!!!
[00:43:04] <agcolom> and the 9h difference is not easy!
[00:43:27] <agcolom> I'll try to look at that today...
[00:43:45] <uGoMobi> haha west coast support is sleeping when you need them ;-)
[00:44:10] <uGoMobi> no stress, Anne
[00:44:27] <uGoMobi> and the good thing about git is... 99.99% can be undone
[00:44:29] <uGoMobi> :)
[00:44:30] <agcolom> Yes!!! ;-) it's easier for me if you do separate PRs for each file.
[00:44:57] <agcolom> yes I wish I could go on a course to learn it properly!
[00:45:03] <uGoMobi> ok, no problem
[00:46:02] <uGoMobi> shall i close that PR about consistency? with so many file changes in one PR
[00:46:51] <agcolom> just one quick note on one change I've seen: the letter "u" is considered as a consonant if it is pronounced 'y' so you'd say 'a usual suspect' and not 'an usual suspect'
[00:47:15] <uGoMobi> ah ok, didn't know that, thanks
[00:47:27] <uGoMobi> so it's "a unique id" as well
[00:47:41] <agcolom> yes, that'd be really helpful, but I put some comments today so we agree...
[00:47:52] <agcolom> yes, I couldn't remember the example ;-)
[00:48:48] <agcolom> The sepaprate PRs also help when I have an issue with a file, I can still do the other files and do tht one later...
[00:49:21] <uGoMobi> so if I understand you right... you first comment on it and then I'll commit them in separate PR's for each file?
[00:49:21] <agcolom> So today I should have some time this afternoon and we are meeting this evening ;-)
[00:49:29] <agcolom> correct.
[00:49:43] <uGoMobi> ok, no problem
[00:50:46] <agcolom> we can clarify also the styling of read-only lists tonight, and whether the way it is currently done is going to change
[00:51:21] <uGoMobi> ok
[00:53:02] <agcolom> Quick JS/JQM question for you: what is the best event to use to initialise the google map when navigating on a page with a map and you only want to initialise it when it comes into view... (I normally use onLoad, but in this case onLoad doesn't get called for some reason)
[00:54:00] <uGoMobi> i think pageshow
[00:54:22] <agcolom> sorry when that page comes into view. The onload works fine if I do a refresh, or reload, but not when the page comes into view...
[00:54:29] <agcolom> ok, will try, thanks :-)
[00:55:09] <uGoMobi> you're welcome
[00:55:56] <agcolom> ok, time to take my son to school.... have a nice day, I'll be in touch in the afternoon...
[00:56:28] <uGoMobi> ok, thank you... you too have a nice day :)
[00:57:55] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[08:29:05] <johnbender> toddparker: toddmparker_: which one are you today?
[08:52:05] <gseguin> Good morning world!
[09:04:11] <johnbender> gseguin: buenos dias
[09:13:30] <gseguin> johnbender: I think I can make that code even prettier ;)
[09:15:29] <uGoMobi> good morning gseguin
[09:15:37] <gseguin> hey uGoMobi
[09:16:15] <gseguin> how is it going on your side of the pond?
[09:16:44] <uGoMobi> all good here
[09:17:01] <uGoMobi> sunny public holiday here
[09:28:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/8DYosQ
[09:28:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Use $.proxy instead of one line function - Ghislain Seguin
[09:38:04] <johnbender> gseguin: it's just so nice
[10:01:52] <uGoMobi> yihaa
[10:02:37] <gseguin> johnbender: heh :)
[10:03:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin can I ask something?
[10:04:03] <gseguin> uGoMobi: shoot
[10:04:51] <uGoMobi> am i correct that this:   o.mini === true ? " ui-mini" : " ui-fullsize";     checks if o.mini is set to true, and...
[10:05:10] <uGoMobi> this: o.mini ? " ui-mini" : " ui-fullsize";    if o.mini is set at all (true or false)
[10:06:49] <gseguin> so the first one tests type and value
[10:07:00] <gseguin> the second one tests truthiness
[10:07:21] <gseguin> so non-empty string will be truthy
[10:07:40] <gseguin> integer different than 0 will be truthy
[10:07:48] <uGoMobi> yes, thats what i mean... so "false" is a non empty string
[10:08:02] <gseguin> the "false" string yes
[10:08:09] <gseguin> not the false boolean value
[10:08:33] <uGoMobi> hmm
[10:09:12] <uGoMobi> makes sense and that was what i thought at first
[10:09:36] <uGoMobi> but the first works as expected and the second doesnt
[10:11:22] <uGoMobi> gseguin: are options "stored" in an object as a string?
[10:12:29] <gseguin> hmm that's a good question, I would say yes but it's possible that the widget factory parses boolean values, johnbender ?
[10:12:42] <uGoMobi> that would explain all
[10:12:51] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/uGoMobi/jquery-mobile/commit/7484654ecc547a1bc8d6160829cfc5404e76328b
[10:12:52] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by uGoMobi (14m, 12s ago): update allow to override default inline and mini styling in header and footer
[10:13:18] <uGoMobi> there you can see what I had to change to make that work
[10:14:58] <gseguin> uGoMobi: what was the original issue?
[10:15:16] <gseguin> gotta run to my stand up meeting
[10:15:20] <gseguin> be back in 15 min
[10:15:44] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok, will show you later
[10:22:23] <toddparker> hi all
[10:24:32] <agcolom> hi :-)
[10:28:04] <JasonDScott> Hi
[10:29:18] <toddparker> just realized the call is coming up
[10:29:32] <toddparker> i need to pull together an agenda…ready your topics
[10:29:57] <agcolom> can we talk about the way read only lists are styled?
[10:32:07] <gseguin> aaaand back
[10:32:45] <gseguin> they've added the live option to the google+ hangout
[10:32:51] <gseguin> woohoo!
[10:37:50] <toddparker> sure agcolom
[10:39:01] <gseguin> toddparker: builder, I'm not there yet but there is progress
[10:40:01] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm not sure, I'd imagine some testing would tell right quick
[10:40:14] <johnbender> sadly uGoMobi is gone :(
[10:42:16] <agcolom> johnbender, gseguin, did you see my email ? (basecamp) regarding event.html?
[10:43:23] <gseguin> I did, sorry did not get time reply
[10:43:33] <gseguin> let's bring it up in the meeting
[10:44:52] <agcolom> yes good idea.
[10:45:34] <johnbender> agcolom: I did, which commit were you referring too
[10:45:39] <johnbender> I can handle cherry picking it over if needs be
[10:45:43] <johnbender> especially since it was mine :D
[10:45:53] <johnbender> agcolom: the one about pageInit?
[10:46:14] <agcolom> the one about tapholdThreshold I think
[10:46:18] <toddparker> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OHHVS-MSccLT34IyIy4AXexMcIvRNWpGx87lweT6Gk/edit
[10:46:36] <toddparker> agcolom: can you post a few issue #'s
[10:48:19] <toddparker> feel free to start editing stuff
[10:51:22] <toddparker> agcolom: i just added an Open dev questions  ////////////////////////////////////////////////
[10:51:24] <toddparker> section
[10:51:31] <toddparker> feel free to add stuff there
[10:52:17] <toddparker> johnbender, gseguin, kinblas ugomobijasper - please add topics
[10:52:31] <toddparker> JasonDScott:
[10:52:32] <johnbender> agcolom: did you cherry pick the docs changes in the order they were added
[10:52:33] <toddparker> you too
[10:52:40] <johnbender> agcolom: that is, my change first then maurices?
[10:52:48] <johnbender> that one has been in there for a while
[10:52:56] <johnbender> agcolom: or did he make the change to an old version of master?
[10:53:05] <johnbender> in which case I would go back and ask him to update his changes
[10:53:10] <toddparker> agreed
[10:53:15] <agcolom> johnbender, yes, I have always done master, then 1.1-stable, master, 1.1-stable, etc...
[10:54:55] <agcolom> I'm happy to update 1.1-stable to add that paragraph in GitHub if that's easier (but i guess that's not the proper way)
[10:56:20] <uGoMobi> johnbender: i am back
[10:57:49] <gseguin> uGoMobi: can you add me to your Google+ circles
[10:57:51] <gseguin> ?
[10:58:05] <gseguin> so I can add you back and send you an invitation to the meeting
[10:58:09] <uGoMobi> gseguin yes
[10:58:21] <gseguin> folks to your Google+ stream
[10:58:29] <gseguin> the hangout is up
[10:58:32] <uGoMobi> i am on other system  think i need install hangouts plugin before meeting
[10:59:31] <gseguin> ok, let me know uGoMobi
[10:59:59] <gseguin> johnbender: where did you go?
[11:01:03] <gseguin> toddparker, Wilto, scottjehl, kinblas, agcolom: check you G+ stream for the hangout invite
[11:01:38] <toddparker> ok, hold on a sec!
[11:01:59] <uGoMobi> gseguin: done
[11:02:06] <gseguin> alright
[11:04:02] <uGoMobi> gseguin: cant find the invite
[11:04:09] <gseguin> hold on
[11:05:19] <gseguin> uGoMobi: should have it
[11:05:32] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes, on my way
[11:55:19] <gseguin> johnbender: don't forget that you're live on the internets
[12:18:12] <gseguin> toddparker: did I shut you guys down?
[12:18:26] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ^?
[12:19:44] <agcolom> gseguin: still working
[12:25:56] <agcolom> Todd, hope my answer for the resources page was ok. Amir has chosen one of the proposed options so will make the change later today or early tomorrow.
[12:36:24] <toddparker> cool. i liked the way you handled that.
[12:36:39] <toddparker> you gotta be tough with these marketing folks agcolom
[12:36:53] <toddparker> uGoMobi: see scott's comment re: read only lists?
[12:36:55] <toddparker> The following CSS would knock back the gradient to flat:
[12:36:55] <toddparker>    .ui-li-static { background-image: none; }
[12:37:09] <toddparker> that seems like a nice, easy change
[12:37:19] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes, i write reply now
[12:37:41] <toddparker> i thinks e still need to set the JS classes to use button classes instead of body to make this all work as we discussed
[12:37:48] <toddparker> but that seems cleanrer
[12:38:38] <toddparker> re: the active classes, I think we'd have a ui-btn-a-active class that would get assigned when we get to that point so it would be a whole new state per swatch but that seems like a direct class swap
[12:38:53] <toddparker> i need to refresh my memory on that stuff
[12:44:46] <agcolom> toddparker: Good, thank. I made the change.
[12:46:21] <uGoMobi> toddparker: scott's solution is best for read-only list
[12:46:44] <uGoMobi> toddparker:  I thought you were talking about just picking background property from a rule and ignore background-image which is not possible as far as i know
[12:46:51] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Looking at the deferred-handler, it seems like I can just call resolve on both objects by hand and that'll constitute the short-circuit.
[12:47:10] <uGoMobi> toddparker: but didn't think about this fix
[12:48:35] <agcolom> Going to have dinner.... bye ...
[12:50:34] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: absolutely
[12:52:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 2 new commits to popup-widget: http://git.io/kdaeNg
[12:52:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] [popup] Add module to unit tests - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:52:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] Merge branch 'master' into popup-widget - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:54:01] <_|Nix|_> The Eagle has landed.
[12:54:13] <gseguin> w00t!
[12:54:53] <_|Nix|_> Now to watch the ensuing havoc ...
[12:55:12] <gseguin> welcome cute popups!
[12:55:51] <gseguin> good work _|Nix|_ !
[12:56:25] <_|Nix|_> Weird that it's labelled "Merge branch 'master' into popup-widget" ...
[12:56:53] <_|Nix|_> I guess it's because I merged master into popup-widget, ran the unit tests, and then merged popup-widget into master ...
[12:57:05] <_|Nix|_> ... so it picked up the commit message from the first merge ...
[12:57:28] <_|Nix|_> Thanks!
[12:57:29] <gseguin> hmm
[12:57:58] <gseguin> how come you the Makefile is modified ?
[12:58:15] <_|Nix|_> Wha ... ?
[12:58:26] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/5692aef938d72985abd12ce90b11d89415a4fd34
[12:58:26] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (17m, 40s ago): Merge branch 'master' into popup-widget
[12:59:47] <_|Nix|_> Oh no! that's weird - it took the version of master that was in popup-widget and put it in master ...
[13:00:22] <gseguin> did you merge master into popup-widget first?
[13:00:26] <_|Nix|_> I did.
[13:00:41] <gseguin> and you didn't do a force push
[13:00:46] <_|Nix|_> No.
[13:00:48] <gseguin> ok
[13:01:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think I'll revert that and merge HEAD~1 of popup-widget into master.
[13:01:21] <gseguin> ok
[13:01:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That should land the correct set of changes.
[13:01:46] <gseguin> sounds good, that commit looks kindda ugly
[13:01:50] <_|Nix|_> Indeed ...
[13:02:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I was a bit overzealous. I should've looked before I pushed.
[13:03:12] <gseguin> it's cool
[13:04:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hell yah
[13:04:23] <johnbender> popup is win
[13:40:57] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I think I fixed it ...
[13:41:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/wgvuIg
[13:41:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Revert "Merge branch 'master' into popup-widget" - Gabriel Schulhof
[13:41:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Revert "Revert "Merge branch 'master' into popup-widget"" - Gabriel Schulhof
[13:41:21] <_|Nix|_> The HEAD of master is now equal to what it was before the faulty merge + popup.
[13:43:30] <_|Nix|_> Please correct me if I'm wrong: The last commit on master was 4b401fee78e1df7279529e42b906965a8c23fe2e. The diff between that and HEAD is exactly equal to the changes introduced by popup.
[13:43:46] <_|Nix|_> Please also confirm if I'm right ;)
[13:45:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ I see another revert
[13:46:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, that's right. That's how you have to do it, according to Linus: http://code.google.com/p/git-core/source/browse/Documentation/howto/revert-a-faulty-merge.txt ...
[13:47:10] <_|Nix|_> git checkout master; git diff 4b401fee78e1df7279529e42b906965a8c23fe2e shows exactly the addition of the popup.
[13:47:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, things should be cool ...
[13:47:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ totally trust you :)
[13:48:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I checked out master, and I looked for the changes introduced by 4b401fee ... they are present ...
[13:48:47] <uGoMobi> then it should be cool indeed
[13:49:16] <uGoMobi> it's just that sometimes things look weird with git but turn out to be the correct way to do it
[13:53:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we have to look into some css 'resets' for the popup... like img vertical-align top
[13:54:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if there's an image inside a popup, then ...
[13:54:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ?
[13:54:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you see 3px whitespace at bottom
[13:54:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... that kind of thing?
[13:55:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I see that. And I think it was you who said that it can be fixed with vertical-align: middle for the img.
[13:55:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: have to check video etc as well... will look into it when going to create examples
[13:55:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Are you talking about css/structure/jquery.mobile.popup.css changes, or in the docs?
[13:56:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah middle works too, but top is better
[13:56:15] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[13:56:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: popup.css yes
[13:57:23] <_|Nix|_> Alright ... I'm pretty sure I managed to merge popup correctly, so me go bed now, I think ... I'll looked at the deferred magic whenever I get a chance ...
[13:57:33] <_|Nix|_> s/looked/look/
[13:57:35] <_|Nix|_> L8R all ...
[13:57:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good night!

[14:06:38] <johnbender> agcolom: were you able to get your conflict issue sorted out?
[14:12:39] <agcolom> johnbender: sorry Had to force quit FF!
[14:14:25] <agcolom> johnbender: well locally I am ok and I can do a checkout and other cherry-pickings as long as I don't touch the file I'm ok
[14:14:39] <agcolom> but in 1.1-stable we are missing 2 commits
[14:14:46] <agcolom> I think
[14:15:49] <johnbender> agcolom: can you past the two hashes and I'll try and sort it out?
[14:15:53] <johnbender> *paste
[14:16:11] <agcolom> sure...
[14:16:35] <johnbender> I'm assuming  one is from me and the other is from Maurice?
[14:20:49] <agcolom> yes
[14:21:41] <agcolom> Here is the page, but I cannot find the hash I used to cherry-pick in the history, so I hope I am using the right number: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/master/docs/api/events.html
[14:22:08] <agcolom> I assume yours is fdbca6379d3740535dcf54158d4e58d553d06ca9
[14:22:26] <uGoMobi> i can give you the hash of that commit
[14:22:29] <agcolom> and maurice's is 698691ea3f360604dd4193ab3f7f1263d935fe68
[14:23:07] <agcolom> but the commit for me merging his into master was 34bb3be
[14:23:46] <agcolom> https://github.com/agcolom and if you go down a bit you'll see that. it's dated 3 days ago
[14:24:45] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ just to let you know that I have updated the footer docs for popups.
[14:25:07] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ am I right this doesn't need cherry-pickig?
[14:25:11] <agcolom> picking ?
[14:26:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Gabriel went to bed
[14:27:51] <agcolom> uGoMobi, yes I thought that might be the case! I'm going in a minute as well... Have got work tomorrow and still have to be up at 6.30 :-(
[14:28:06] <uGoMobi> ouch :(
[14:28:32] <agcolom> indeed!!!
[14:28:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: quick question... do you know if we can reach agenda for weekly call during the week?
[14:29:04] <uGoMobi> easier than thinking of topics 1 minute for start
[14:30:37] <gseguin> toddparker: ^
[14:31:48] <agcolom> uGoMobi: not sure.... That's a question for toddparker
[14:32:16] <uGoMobi> yeah, you are right... should ask Todd
[14:32:30] <johnbender> agcolom: those hashes you pasted are on master correct?
[14:32:54] <agcolom> yes, master
[14:33:12] <agcolom> (That just looks like I called you master!)
[14:33:17] <johnbender> haha
[14:34:24] <agcolom> and yours has to go 1st
[14:34:38] <johnbender> agcolom: ok I cherry picked both over in order
[14:34:45] <johnbender> agcolom: I'm going to push and then do you want to take a look?
[14:35:08] <agcolom> ok
[14:35:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/YMIHLg
[14:35:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] tapholdThreshold docs - John Bender
[14:35:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Docs: move tapholdThreshold from tap to taphold (events.html) - Maurice Gottlieb
[14:35:53] <johnbender> agcolom: ^
[14:36:56] <agcolom> yep, I am checking the doc on 1.1-stable
[14:37:06] <agcolom> messages look good...
[14:38:04] <agcolom> I am not getting the updated docs version yet, but usually that takes a dew minutes
[14:43:47] <agcolom> johnbender: I just checked in Github and all good there!!! Thank you...
[14:45:24] <agcolom> btw did Brad get back to you? (I am thinking he may have been traveling back as I have not seen him online, but he followed me on twitter after your message so I supposed that's a good sign)
[14:48:30] <agcolom> bedtime for me... goodnight all
[14:49:07] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[14:50:05] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper
[15:13:58] <toddparker> hi all - I made a new agenda google doc for next week's call, feel free to start adding stuff as it comes up. https://docs.google.com/document/d/12y8NF0TupxH_Ps950gNxz06hM2nt_R_ZL-c_v0mONZY/edit
[15:14:52] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: we don't need to cherry pick anything pop-over related
[15:15:02] <toddparker> master = 1.2 which is when popup drops
[15:15:24] <toddparker> cherry picking is just for small fixes that could be applied to 1.1.1 (1.1-stable branch)
[15:21:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that is bugs or docs updates
[15:21:26] <johnbender> no new features
[15:21:29] <johnbender> "read my lips"
[15:21:30] <johnbender> etc etc
[17:02:50] <gseguin> oh I like that idea d9n
