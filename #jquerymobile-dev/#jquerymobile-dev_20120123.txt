[07:37:05] <rwaldron> Good morning
[07:37:06] <bot-t> (49 hours 40 mins ago) <ben_alman> tell rwaldron Even semicolon haters must bow down to ASI once in a while: http://bit.ly/xa5Mg5
[07:37:23] <rwaldron> toddmparker yt?
[07:45:28] <toddparker> morning rwaldron
[07:45:36] <rwaldron> Hey dude
[07:45:40] <toddparker> hey
[07:45:47] <toddparker> good weekend?
[07:45:48] <rwaldron> I'm experiencing a pretty consistent funkiness with master
[07:46:01] <rwaldron> (yes, thank you! hopefully you as well)
[07:46:53] <rwaldron> specifically, the header toolbar of the "initially displayed data-role="page" " (let's call it "Home") flicks and dissappears
[07:47:17] <rwaldron> i'll see it there, and then when the loading spinner displays, it's gone
[07:47:31] <rwaldron> when the spinner is hidden, the header toolbar doesn't return
[07:47:55] <rwaldron> (actually, the footer displays the same behaviour)
[07:48:19] <rwaldron> I was testing with master from Thursday
[07:48:32] <rwaldron> I figured I'd update, which I just did, but no change
[07:48:52] <rwaldron> I'm _only_ seeing this on iOS 5.0 devices
[07:48:57] <rwaldron> in chrome, it's totally fine
[07:49:05] <Wilto> You pickin’ fights in here, rwaldron?
[07:49:10] <rwaldron> naw
[07:49:21] <rwaldron> :SOS"
[07:49:23] <rwaldron> ack
[07:49:25] <rwaldron> "
[08:03:30] <toddparker> rwaldron: yeah, we're tracking down  few issues with fixed right now
[08:03:35] <toddparker> scott landed one over the weekend
[08:03:49] <toddparker> there is a still something up with the tap to hide.show
[08:03:50] <rwaldron> ok, I'm currently running the latest master
[08:04:05] <rwaldron> yeah, this was ok until thursday evening i think
[08:04:08] <toddparker> scott is looking at this as we speak
[08:04:12] <rwaldron> awesome
[08:04:26] <rwaldron> let me know if you need to me to test anything
[08:04:38] <rwaldron> when/if scott makes a commit or whatever
[08:04:47] <rwaldron> i'll pull it down and run it in the app
[08:04:48] <toddparker> k
[08:06:16] <toddparker> anyone have some time to look at this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3472
[08:06:16] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3472 on jquery-mobile, reported by dak1 (17m, 28s ago): Pages with data-ajax="false" on form fail to load
[08:06:23] <toddparker> seems like a baddie
[08:31:45] <imjoshdean> toddparker: can't tell, is this a phonegap issue or a general issue?
[08:32:01] <imjoshdean> if it's the latter, put it on my plate, I'll look at it this week.
[08:43:54] <rwaldron> toddparker heads up, when i turned the debug console on, the toolbars appear
[08:43:56] <rwaldron> go figure.
[08:47:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/I3vIIg
[08:47:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] fixed the fixed toolbar tap toggle. Footers weren't moving to bottom. This line was outta line - scottjehl
[08:53:29] <Wilto> rwaldron: I think that triggers a resize.
[08:54:17] <rwaldron> ah, word, that makes complete sense
[08:54:34] <rwaldron> (in no other world but the one of mobile browser development)
[08:54:40] <Wilto> _Exactly._
[08:55:05] <Wilto> There’s “makes sense,” there’s “‘makes sense,’” and then there’s “makes Android sense.”
[08:55:17] <rwaldron> ahahaha
[08:55:29] <rwaldron> I've become familiar with all three of these
[08:55:46] <rwaldron> Also, android must be destroyed.
[08:56:28] <rwaldron> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBFRekoeQE8
[08:57:51] <johnbender> toddparker: whats the call on using the jquery version chooser in the docs
[08:58:36] <johnbender> gseguin: did you get a chance to merge in the branch commits sans the docs change?
[09:11:21] <rwaldron> toddparker!!!
[09:11:34] <rwaldron> I think I fixed it
[09:12:00] <rwaldron> or at least discovered the point of cause
[09:12:08] <toddparker> yeah?
[09:12:49] <toddparker> johnbender: i'm good with whatever you guys think makes sense not eh version thing
[09:13:04] <toddparker> use throwing an idea out, no idea if it made sense
[09:13:06] <rwaldron> in jquery.mobile.init.js
[09:13:13] <rwaldron> line 150
[09:13:14] <rwaldron> window.scrollTo( 0, 1 );
[09:13:32] <rwaldron> commenting this out preserves the toolbars from disappearing
[09:13:45] <toddparker> that is to hide the chrome
[09:13:49] <toddparker> hmmm
[09:15:00] <rwaldron> yeah
[09:15:15] <rwaldron> so... more like "or at least discovered the point of cause"
[09:15:23] <johnbender> toddparker: my only concern is that it replaces the jquery.js include, which has been sited as possibly confusing
[09:15:34] <johnbender> for folks that are not us reading the docs
[09:20:13] <toddparker> right. well, that's always my concern - people copying and pasting our pagesg our pages
[09:20:29] <toddparker> heh
[09:20:49] <toddparker> one less thing that looks like how they would set up a page
[09:22:58] <toddparker> rwaldron: scott landed a fix…give it a whirl
[09:23:41] <rwaldron> nice
[09:24:46] <rwaldron> toddparker... wait... this one? "fixed the fixed toolbar tap toggle. Footers weren't moving to bottom" https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7f2e50430e48b1b7af6e96126fbf0ca4b6be940d

[09:24:54] <Wilto> Yep.
[09:24:55] <rwaldron> I tried that right when i saw it appear in here
[09:24:58] <rwaldron> no dice

[09:34:10] <rwaldron> toddparker  Wilto I just filed this pull request: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3473
[09:34:12] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by rwldrn (43.849s ago): Fixes loss of toolbar persistance (tested on iOS 4.0, 4.2, 4.3 & 5.0.1; Android 2.3.4)
[09:35:24] <rwaldron> not sure if that's the best approach, but it fixes the issue without disruption on older devices
[09:36:18] <rwaldron> note: for some reason the navbar i have in my header is overlapping the listview in the page... i can live with it for now
[09:36:39] <rwaldron> anyway, maybe that can help scott narrow down the issue
[09:38:40] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:39:08] <gseguin> johnbender: what changes are you talking about?
[09:39:26] <johnbender> gseguin: the jquery version changes
[09:39:37] <johnbender> gseguin: there's also an issue I didn't think of
[09:39:43] <johnbender> though it's not a big one
[09:39:45] <gseguin> yeah right now I cherry-picked only the /tests changes
[09:40:06] <gseguin> as we discussed last night
[09:40:13] <johnbender> yah I saw them
[09:40:24] <johnbender> gseguin: realized I could just go look :/
[09:40:53] <johnbender> gseguin: my ghetto original solution to use a query param to disable hashchange makes this a bit harder
[09:42:08] * gseguin goes back to his meeting
[10:13:57] <gseguin> toddparker, johnbender, Wilto: Can one of you look into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3469

[10:46:28] <eddiemonge> gseguin: i dont think line 49 in the makefile should be a variable since that is using a static file
[10:52:57] * gseguin looks
[10:55:11] <gseguin> eddiemonge: can you send me a link to the file with the line highlighted
[10:55:28] <gseguin> there is nothing line 49 on master

[10:57:09] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (2d, 11h ago): Variableized the JavaScript runner
[10:57:17] <gseguin> that made it to master
[10:58:10] <eddiemonge> this line: -o cssIn=css/structure/${STRUCTURE}.css
[10:58:16] <eddiemonge> that defines the input file right?
[10:58:33] <gseguin> oh
[10:58:50] <eddiemonge> itll break when you run make deploy
[10:59:19] <gseguin> yes that does define the input file
[10:59:51] * gseguin may not be caffeinated enough
[11:00:05] <eddiemonge> -o cssIn=css/structure/jquery.mobile.structure.css
[11:00:23] <gseguin> why?
[11:00:35] <gseguin> does STRUCTURE change ?
[11:00:44] <eddiemonge> if you run make deploy, itll look for jquery.mobile.structure-1.1.css
[11:01:12] <gseguin> oh yep I see
[11:01:18] <gseguin> good catch
[11:01:32] <gseguin> will fix that quickly
[11:02:40] <eddiemonge> other than that it seemed fine
[11:05:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to css-structure-consolidate: http://git.io/Q5uTtg

[11:27:02] <eddiemonge> gseguin: i think this page needs something done to it https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/226b7e5a290b1fbf1adc7c844a66ccaf87af102a/docs/config/jq17b1.html
[11:27:45] <gseguin> indeed
[11:28:17] <gseguin> it probably needs to be remove
[11:28:18] <gseguin> d
[11:28:26] <eddiemonge> i would think so
[11:32:20] <gseguin> and...
[11:32:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to jquery-version-selector: http://git.io/8RIg1w

[11:33:13] <gseguin> thanks eddiemonge
[11:35:42] <toddparker> anyone have a response for mike sherov re: simplify offset in core? just want to make sure we respond...
[11:48:14] <rwaldron> toddparker is scott there with you?
[11:49:18] <rwaldron> http://gyazo.com/2ec683c971a39d30ece89ebd51ef7d0b.png might be useful
[11:49:54] <rwaldron> if you uncheck .fade.in, .fade.out.animate { opacity: 0 } it restores the toobars
[11:50:24] <rwaldron> looks like they aren't being reset after the page is initialized
[12:10:45] <rwaldron> looks like changing...
[12:11:06] <rwaldron> $el.removeClass( "out " + hideClass );
[12:11:06] <rwaldron> 	.addClass( "in" );
[12:11:15] <rwaldron> to... $el.removeClass( "out " + hideClass );
[12:11:17] <rwaldron> fixes it
[12:11:23] <rwaldron> across the board
[12:12:45] <Wilto> Scott’s back off the clock—happy to give that a try, though.
[12:12:45] <bot-t> (8 mins 6 secs ago) <miketaylr> tell Wilto can you communicate to the #ffly crowd that the spaceship helmet avatar thing is starting to smell like spoiled dairy? xoxo -Mike
[12:24:44] <Wilto> …
[12:27:22] * miketaylr apologizes for snark :(
[12:27:33] <eddiemonge>  /ban miketaylr
[12:27:42] <miketaylr> hahaha
[12:27:47] <Wilto> Snark is my schtick ’round these parts, miketaylr.
[12:28:08] <miketaylr> carry on, don't let my bot abuse get in the way of writing codes
[12:28:18] <Wilto> YOUR FACE IS DAIRY
[12:28:21] <rwaldron> Wilto: what is the difference between jquery.mobile.css and *.structure.*
[12:28:24] <Wilto> See that? That’s how burns are done.
[12:31:51] <eddiemonge> rwaldron: structure is structure only and the other is the theme - colors and stuff
[12:33:09] <johnbender> Wilto: interesting I just saw the tweet about droping ie support in jq?
[12:33:17] <johnbender> why don't they just dump ie6
[12:33:26] <johnbender> I'd imagine that would make a dent anyhow eh?
[12:33:33] <johnbender> maybe not though
[12:33:42] <johnbender> holy christ
[12:33:43] <Wilto> nnngh my head.
[12:33:44] <johnbender> a plugin
[12:33:48] <Wilto> SUCH OPINIONS HAVE I ON THIS TOPIC
[12:33:56] <johnbender> ie support as a plugin
[12:33:58] <johnbender> wtf
[12:34:03] <johnbender> not a bad thing
[12:34:17] <johnbender> but that seems like it would be a massive internal change
[12:34:40] <Wilto> Here’s the thing:
[12:35:15] <johnbender> though they seem to have the test coverage
[12:35:16] <Wilto> How many John Q. Lightboxplugin devs are gonna drop IE8 support because jQuery did?
[12:36:07] <johnbender> Wilto: that puts the onus on the people who need o support those browsers to alter the plugins though
[12:36:13] <johnbender> which, isn't a total minus
[12:36:24] <johnbender> Wilto: though I agree it will result in less ie support period
[12:36:29] <Wilto> IE8 is like 20+% of users, worldwide.
[12:36:39] <miketaylr> inorite
[12:36:46] <Wilto> And it’s The Browser for most users on assistive technologies.
[12:36:54] <johnbender> Wilto: would be nice to drop ie6
[12:36:56] <Wilto> I get that IE sucks to work on, and I get where it’s holding the web back.
[12:37:05] <johnbender> Wilto: no it's about library size
[12:37:08] <johnbender> is my guess
[12:37:10] <Wilto> That too.
[12:37:12] <Wilto> Not wrong, again.
[12:37:13] <johnbender> they keep getting slammed on that
[12:37:32] <johnbender> gseguin: build is working with the jquery versions
[12:37:39] <Wilto> Yeah, I mean, valid concern for sure.
[12:38:03] <miketaylr> my prediction: the IE<=8 compat plugin will look like this after 1 year or so: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/xpath
[12:38:09] <Wilto> But “now with 15% less code, and also sucks to be you blind people” isn’t an appealing tagline.
[12:38:55] <johnbender> Wilto: do assistive folks use ie6?
[12:39:07] <Wilto> The point is to make websites that work for as many users as possible.
[12:39:14] <Wilto> Less. I’m cool with dropping IE6.
[12:39:20] <Wilto> Even seven.
[12:39:28] <johnbender> oh yah I'm not in on the ie8 thing
[12:39:30] <johnbender> that seems odd to me
[12:39:38] <johnbender> but again I don't know the internals
[12:40:10] <Wilto> Eight seems… Preemptive.
[12:40:21] <Wilto> Like “almost a quarter of the world gets errors now” preemptive.
[12:40:40] <Wilto> But again, it’s in the future, and maybe not even gonna happen,
[12:41:10] <johnbender> Wilto: 2.0 is the time to do it though
[12:41:16] <johnbender> since that will shatter backward compat
[12:41:21] <Wilto> I mean… If you gotta.
[12:41:25] <Wilto> Still.
[12:41:54] <johnbender> Wilto: maybe if the plugin was included by default on release?
[12:42:05] <Wilto> I suppose, yeah.
[12:42:20] <johnbender> and you had to explicitly use a different version on the cdn to exclude it
[12:42:26] <johnbender> jq-lite :(
[12:42:28] <johnbender> less calories
[12:42:37] <gseguin> johnbender: that's awesome!
[12:42:42] <Wilto> I dunno. “Do you want to use more code, or support IE8?” The average new dev’s first reaction is gonna be “HELL NO I HATE IE8.”
[12:42:53] <Wilto> I feel like… it gives them an excuse.
[12:43:02] <Wilto> Like the cool kids said it was okay not to support IE8.
[12:43:15] <Wilto> I dunno; whatever. Internet Opinions™.
[12:43:21] <miketaylr> pretty sure jquery 2.0 will end up webkit only anyways
[12:43:31] <Wilto> LOOKS BEST IN NETSCAPE 5

[12:46:29] <gseguin> not through the PR, right?
[12:46:38] <Wilto> merge, fetch upstream, rebase, push.
[12:46:44] <Wilto> Yeah, just giving things a look locally first.
[12:46:59] <gseguin> oh ok, 'cause you're missing a commit
[12:47:09] <johnbender> anytime I see merge then rebase
[12:47:13] <johnbender> I get nervouce
[12:47:16] <gseguin> that's fine I'll press the green button
[12:47:19] <johnbender> even though it's not always a bad thing
[12:47:30] <Wilto> It was an okay thing here, yeah?
[12:47:41] <gseguin> yeah should be

[12:48:30] <gseguin> yep you're right
[12:48:47] <gseguin> then I'll just close that PR, delete that branch and be quiet

[13:00:42] <johnbender> JasonDScott: that one has been tricket for quite some time
[13:00:45] <johnbender> *tickey
[13:00:49] <johnbender> *trickey
[13:00:59] * johnbender is getting a new keyboard
[13:01:01] <gseguin> does it pass when you run only that test?
[13:01:16] <Wilto> Yeah, I think that one occasionally bursts into flames if you run it in an inactive tab.
[13:01:17] <johnbender> *tricky
[13:01:22] <JasonDScott> johnbender: yes
[13:02:09] <JasonDScott> gseguin: no
[13:02:09] <johnbender> Wilto: innactive tab you say
[13:02:12] <johnbender> going to look
[13:02:32] <Wilto> From memory, yeah, I think so.
[13:02:46] <JasonDScott> Expected:

[13:03:12] <johnbender> JasonDScott: yay!
[13:03:16] <johnbender> ok that's totally fixable
[13:03:17] <johnbender> one sec
[13:03:26] <gseguin> yikes
[13:03:40] <Wilto> We owe you so much, test suite.
[13:04:18] <johnbender> JasonDScott: is that the first assertion?
[13:04:45] <johnbender> JasonDScott: there are a bunch of assertions in there that expect `location.pathname +`
[13:04:56] <johnbender> that should be location.pathname + location.search or something similar
[13:04:59] <johnbender> try that
[13:06:11] <JasonDScott> johnbender: yes that is the first one, there are two others failing
[13:21:52] <JasonDScott> johnbender: That worked
[13:22:49] <JasonDScott> Do I need to push these changes up?
[14:08:16] <Wilto> Hey, git-folk: best way to create a new local tracking branch or whatever? “git checkout -b branch-name origin/branch-name”?
[14:09:23] <ajpiano> Wilto: git branch -t branchname origin/branchname
[14:09:54] <Wilto> Thanks, Brocarina of Time.
[14:18:54] <ajpiano> no broblem

[14:37:31] <gseguin> yeeha!
[14:38:54] <johnbender> toddparker: what's the next step on 1.1

[15:04:46] <gseguin> lol
[15:05:03] <johnbender> EVERY DAY SHUFFLIN'
[15:05:23] <toddparker> BOOYA
[15:05:43] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/awyeah.gif
[15:06:17] <johnbender> toddparker: whats the word on 1.0.1
[15:06:21] <johnbender> sorry I typed 1.1 before
[15:06:54] <gseguin> maintenance release, hence 1.6.4
[15:06:59] <gseguin> right?
[15:07:11] <johnbender> gseguin: oh yah we already sorted that out, I'm asking about doing the release
[15:09:10] <gseguin> oh ok
[15:11:52] <gseguin> JasonDScott: took a quick look at your PR, I think Kin is going to be the right person to review that but on the coding standard we try to stick to jQuery coding standards: http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[15:13:46] <Wilto> Speaking of: are you guys gonna hit me if I propose something that stands to make a bit more work for us, pre-1.1?
[15:14:04] <gseguin> what is it?
[15:14:29] <Wilto> I feel like things could stand a once-over in the “code style” department.
[15:15:17] <Wilto> I’m mostly speaking for me, here. I wouldn’t mind taking an hour or two before the major release to do some cleanup on stuff that has fallen out-of-sync with the style guidelines.
[15:15:38] <gseguin> that would be a good idea
[15:15:51] <Wilto> Actually, I am now just saying outright “that is a thing that I am going to do, if that’s cool.”
[15:15:53] <Wilto> ?CC
[15:15:53] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[15:16:12] <gseguin> rwaldron already did a pass before the RCs
[15:16:22] <gseguin> so we're not in too bad of a shape
[15:16:38] <toddparker> john bender - if all the commits are picked over on 1.0-stable
[15:16:42] <gseguin> but yeah it could be closer to perfection
[15:16:46] <toddparker> i'll finish up the blog post tonight
[15:16:56] <toddparker> mat can do a full test tomorrow on devices
[15:17:03] <toddparker> and i think we're ready to go
[15:17:16] <toddparker> anything i'm missing on 1.0.1?
[15:18:01] <toddparker> johnbender: we need to look at this one…might be worth hitting for 1.0.1
[15:18:02] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3472
[15:18:03] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3472 on jquery-mobile, reported by dak1 (7h, 29m ago): Pages with data-ajax="false" on form fail to load
[15:18:18] <toddparker> don't like pages failing to load
[15:18:23] <johnbender> toddparker: indeed
[15:18:38] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll take a look right now unless someone else is drooling over it
[15:21:31] <toddparker> -crickets-
[15:25:02] <johnbender> toddparker: yah I already started lol
[15:29:15] <johnbender> toddparker: appears to be fixed in master
[15:31:11] <toddparker> oh, really?
[15:31:13] <toddparker> odd
[15:31:44] <toddparker> think scott has all the zoom fixes ready for tomorrow. final testing tonight, then it'll go into master for 1.1
[15:31:52] <toddparker> ok, heading out boys
[15:32:03] <toddparker> i'll be bloggin away tonite
[15:32:45] <johnbender> toddparker: kewl
[15:36:17] <johnbender> toddparker:
[15:36:24] <johnbender> http://jsbin.com/ayisul/3
[15:36:27] <johnbender> works for me!
[15:42:15] <toddparker> me too
[15:42:41] <johnbender> toddparker: I responded but I'm guessing it's not an issue given how many people disable ajax with forms
[15:55:05] <johnbender> danheberden: thoughts on the weds meeting?
[15:55:14] * johnbender continues his pestering
[16:32:28] <johnbender> toddparker: I've got sergey's checkboxradio changes ready to merge into master
[16:32:45] <johnbender> do you want to wait on those or are you comfortable adding that to the testing stack when release time comes for 1.1
[16:42:09] <JasonDScott> What is the JQM convention on making changes to a pull request? Do you just commit as usual and push to that remote branch or do you do an interactive rebase and squash your commits down to a single commit?
[16:42:35] <johnbender> JasonDScott: if you push to the branch from which the pull request was made it will simply update the pull request
[16:42:49] <johnbender> the PR is just a diff between the branch you submitted against and the branch you submitted from
[16:42:57] <johnbender> starting from the common ancestor
[16:43:29] <johnbender> if there's a conflict whoever manages the pull request will most likely do a rebase from their copy of your branch
[16:43:40] <johnbender> so if you want to save them some time you can do the rebase for them and update your branch
[16:44:59] <JasonDScott> johnbender: right but some projects like to keep their commit history clean and want everything to be pull in as one commit. This is not true with JQM?
[16:45:30] <gseguin> the more commits the better
[16:45:50] <JasonDScott> even for style changes?
[16:45:51] <johnbender> JasonDScott: yes huge monolithic commits are bad
[16:48:31] <JasonDScott> agreed, but even for just style changes, it should be done over multiple commits?
[16:48:35] <johnbender> JasonDScott: it's not as big of a deal with style changes but in general we like small commits so that we can step back through history to see where soemthing changed easily
[16:49:10] <johnbender> JasonDScott: if someone is looking at a commit of your style changes it should be easy to tell what it did
[16:49:15] <JasonDScott> Ok, thanks
[16:49:20] <johnbender> if it's a big glob of +'s and -'s that's bad
[16:49:30] <johnbender> thats a general rule of thumb
[16:49:45] <johnbender> JasonDScott: we keep our history clean where we can by using rebase with small commits
[16:49:49] <johnbender> that keeps ie linear
[16:49:54] <johnbender> *it linear
[16:52:27] <JasonDScott> So someone else on the team will rebase or should I be doing that now?
[16:53:47] <gseguin> JasonDScott: what John meant was, when you're taking an update from your remote we prefer rebase to merge
[16:53:56] <gseguin> whenever possible
[16:54:08] <gseguin> that prevents merge commits
[16:54:51] <gseguin> for your branch just push your whitespace change to that branch
[16:55:22] <gseguin> and someone will merge it through github after review of content
[16:55:44] <gseguin> does that make sense?
[16:56:16] <JasonDScott> Yes. Perfect sense. thanks
