[00:34:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, the test works fine, but the navReset does not.
[00:52:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Here's what's happening: If the initial popstate happens before navReset gets called, it gets ignored, and everything's hunky dorey ... if navReset gets called before the initial popstate happens, navigator thinks that the popstate resulting from the setting of location.hash by navReset is the initial popstate event and will prevent it.
[00:53:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: And navigator is right, it /is/ the initial popstate, but unlike every other time, it must not be ignored :/

[07:15:18] <toddmparker> morning
[07:21:23] <frequent> good afternoon
[07:28:27] <toddmparker> hey frequent 
[07:28:54] <frequent> hey
[07:29:36] <frequent> I would have some filter widget questions for arschmitz and you? 
[07:29:40] <toddmparker> gseguin, uGoMobi, arschmitz - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder/issues/35#issuecomment-15084989
[07:29:58] <toddmparker> frequent: i can answer functional Q's for sure
[07:29:58] <arschmitz> Hey frequent
[07:30:04] <toddmparker> plugin Q's would be arschmitz 
[07:30:51] <frequent> ok. what do you think about not making the widget dependent on listview/table/custom-select, but allow to use it on "groups-of-elements" in general?
[07:31:04] <frequent> A group could be checkboxes in a popup
[07:31:18] <frequent> or whatever
[07:31:26] <arschmitz> Hmm could be cool toddmparker: what do you think?
[07:31:50] <frequent> not sure how to do this yet, but I'm often stuck thinking... where is a filter for that
[07:32:21] <frequent> would also enable a table column filter for example
[07:33:29] <frequent> 2nd thought was allowing to override the filter functionality altogether (besides "JQM filter" and customFilterCallback. So if I want to update my filterable items server-side, I can completely switch off JQM
[07:33:48] <frequent> and pull data from the server
[07:34:07] <arschmitz> not completely following you on that one
[07:34:43] <frequent> 1sec
[07:35:30] <toddmparker> Seems like it could be cool
[07:35:49] <arschmitz> yeah i like the idea of having a standalone filter widget
[07:36:01] <frequent> http://bit.ly/ZZtISB
[07:36:05] <arschmitz> as long as it does not make it too complicated dealing with different possabilities
[07:36:09] <gseguin> Good morning!
[07:36:13] <frequent> this is your autocomplete demo
[07:36:20] <toddmparker> hey gseguin 
[07:36:21] <frequent> but I added some entries upfront
[07:36:24] <gseguin> hey toddmparker 
[07:36:25] <toddmparker> working on the release
[07:36:32] <gseguin> tsdoit
[07:36:36] <toddmparker> almost ready on the site so we can tag soon
[07:36:37] <frequent> which will be filtered before the autocomplete polls the server
[07:36:48] <frequent> idea was to switch this off
[07:37:05] <gseguin> toddmparker: let me know when I can deploy, tag and push
[07:37:18] <toddmparker> I only need 5 minutes more
[07:37:50] <arschmitz> frequent so your saying have it so filter can be disabled and enabled?
[07:38:01] <frequent> correct
[07:38:11] <arschmitz> ok yes it actually should be able to do this
[07:38:17] <arschmitz> its one of the widget factory promises
[07:38:24] <frequent> would that be the widget disable() ?
[07:38:30] <arschmitz> that any widget can be disabled
[07:38:35] <frequent> ... :-)
[07:38:38] <frequent> ok
[07:38:47] <arschmitz> disable actually calls a setOption
[07:39:00] <arschmitz> so you would want to handle it through set option
[07:39:08] <frequent> ok. sounds good
[07:39:16] <arschmitz> and it automaticly sets a class of .ui-state-disabled
[07:39:31] <frequent> but then the whole filter is "dead", isn't it?
[07:39:50] <arschmitz> yes true you want to only disable the filtering
[07:40:02] <frequent> whereas I'm trying to disable ONKEYUP
[07:40:17] <arschmitz> ok so for that you would want to handle it yourself
[07:40:22] <arschmitz> not through disable()
[07:40:56] <frequent> ok
[07:41:28] <frequent> so. brainstorm wrapped. thx.
[07:42:12] <arschmitz> cool no problem
[07:43:56] <toddmparker> just relayed we had file sizes in the download section that are totally off
[07:44:07] <toddmparker> they are from 1.0 or something. library is a lot bigger
[07:46:54] <toddmparker> gseguin: we also say "Minified and Gzipped structure without a theme: jquery.mobile-1.2.1.min.css"
[07:47:06] <toddmparker> but the files are only minified, gzip is a server thing, right?
[07:47:18] <gseguin> correct
[07:47:18] <toddmparker> i'm going to remove all the file sizes
[07:47:23] <toddmparker> and the gzip thing
[07:47:37] <gseguin> ok
[07:49:13] <toddmparker> ok, ready to tag
[07:50:53] <gseguin> building and deploying
[07:52:11] <toddmparker> cool
[07:52:29] <toddmparker> I've removed the file size and gzip language from the newer blog posts
[07:52:36] <toddmparker> copy paste blindness
[07:52:50] <gseguin> ok

[08:01:09] <toddmparker> ok!
[08:02:32] <toddmparker> dangit, we need to update the version here manually
[08:02:36] <toddmparker> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/
[08:02:41] <toddmparker> gseguin: mind doing that?
[08:02:57] <toddmparker> last time we should have to deal with that
[08:03:12] <gseguin> not a problem
[08:05:59] <toddmparker> cool
[08:06:07] <toddmparker> i gotta update the MSFT CDN now
[08:06:10] <toddmparker> keep forgetting
[08:08:23] <gseguin> toddmparker: should I redirect to the compiled version
[08:08:37] <gseguin> or move the compiled version into 1.2.1
[08:08:52] <gseguin> the diference is going to be what's in the client's url
[08:09:27] <toddmparker> gseguin: sorry, not sure I understand...
[08:10:00] <gseguin> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/compiled/demos/
[08:10:13] <gseguin> there is where the version is correct
[08:10:28] <toddmparker> oh, i see
[08:10:38] <gseguin> I can either get rid of the repo that lives in the 1.2.1 directory
[08:10:39] <toddmparker> johnbender ran into this with 1.1.2
[08:10:45] <toddmparker> i think he just re-tagged?
[08:10:54] <toddmparker> not sure how he updated it
[08:10:58] <gseguin> there is no need to retag
[08:11:03] <toddmparker> be good to be consistent
[08:11:15] <gseguin> it's just because it's picking up the dev version
[08:11:24] <gseguin> I'll look at 1.1.2
[08:11:24] <toddmparker> oh, i see
[08:11:29] <toddmparker> k
[08:12:49] <gseguin> it's not solved in 1.1.2 either
[08:12:50] <gseguin> :D
[08:14:05] <toddmparker> heh
[08:14:09] <toddmparker> so what did he do?
[08:14:26] <toddmparker> wait, i swear that was fixed
[08:14:42] <toddmparker> hrm
[08:15:32] <gseguin> I added a meta refresh tag
[08:15:34] <gseguin> ?CC
[08:15:35] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[08:17:09] <toddmparker> heh
[08:17:29] <gseguin> hmm that didn't work that well for 1.1.2
[08:17:32] <toddmparker> so high text
[08:17:39] <toddmparker> tech
[08:17:48] <toddmparker> no? seemed like a foolproof plan.
[08:18:33] <gseguin> oh I know
[08:18:36] <gseguin> I'm a moron
[08:19:07] <gseguin> I added the meta before building
[08:19:21] <gseguin> so the redirection is both in the source and in the built index
[08:19:42] <gseguin> ?BOOM
[08:19:43] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"

[10:45:57] <agcolom> toddmparker: Rwhitbeck I forgot that I need to pick up my daughter at 7.30pm from one of her activities (one off so not used to it!). I only need 5-10 mins to pick her up, it's not far. 
[10:46:48] <agcolom> but that's in the middle of our meeting. so it is ok if I escape for max 10 min or would you prefer to reschedule from when I'm back or later?
[10:51:31] <Rwhitbeck> I am fine with a todd absense in the middle. 
[10:51:44] <Rwhitbeck> only so much Todd you can take at one time. :P

[11:03:29] <toddmparker> i can
[11:03:50] <toddmparker> agcolom - now good for you?

[11:53:08] <agcolom> I'm back online!
[11:53:21] <agcolom> Rwhitbeck: toddmparker ^
[11:53:43] <Rwhitbeck> too late we just assigned everything to you
[11:54:00] <agcolom> Rwhitbeck: :-)
[11:55:30] <agcolom> btw I think the email I was trying to send earlier has just been sent!!! a bit late ;-)
[11:55:40] <Rwhitbeck> haha I was just going to say
[11:55:57] <Rwhitbeck> yeah we just meet … there isn't that much left to do 
[11:56:18] <Rwhitbeck> The big hurdle is toddmparker needs to get his environment set up. 
[11:56:38] <agcolom> ok... so you had the meeting already?
[12:03:16] <_|Nix|_> This really sucks! You can define getters and setters for anything ... /except/ a function's prototype :(
[12:04:12] <_|Nix|_> You can set the function prototype to anything you want, but you cannot define getters or setters on it.
[12:04:26] <_|Nix|_> For example, this is fine: x = function() {}; x.prototype = "string";
[12:05:32] <_|Nix|_> But this won't work: x = function() {}; x.prototype = "string"; x.__defineGetter( "prototype", function() { return 5; } );
[12:05:46] <_|Nix|_> If you then check x.prototype it will still return "string";
[12:05:49] <_|Nix|_> :(
[12:06:04] <_|Nix|_> I mean __defineGetter__
[12:19:37] <toddmparker> Rwhitbeck: i installed wordpress, but haven't figured out the dB part yet
[12:21:52] <toddmparker> Rwhitbeck: can you use mamp for the database bizness
[12:22:28] <Rwhitbeck> yeah…just open up the myphpadmin from inside MAMP
[12:23:19] <toddmparker> maybe i need pro?
[12:24:10] <toddmparker> Rwhitbeck: ok, found it
[12:24:47] <toddmparker> just create a new database?
[12:24:52] <Rwhitbeck> yeah
