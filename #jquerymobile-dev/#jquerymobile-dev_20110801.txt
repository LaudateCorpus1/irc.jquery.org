[08:12:58] <toddparker> hey all
[09:44:08] <_nickel> toddparker: gseguin: pache caching strikes!
[09:44:10] <_nickel> *page
[09:44:25] <_nickel> thats what's causing the broken dialog select
[09:44:28] <_nickel> should have known
[09:44:28] <gseguin> hi _nickel
[09:44:30] <_nickel> ugh slow connect
[09:44:42] <_nickel> page caching is causing the broken select
[09:44:47] <_nickel> hopefully I'll have a fix shortly
[09:45:04] <gseguin> page caching as in domCache?
[09:56:22] <_nickel> yes
[09:56:40] <_nickel> I have to pre-appologize for weird typing/wording today
[09:56:46] <_nickel> I did not get much sleep last night
[09:57:18] <gseguin> I guessed that from the time of your last email and you checking in on IRC
[09:57:22] <gseguin> ;)
[10:00:45] <_nickel> I got a little excited about that hack
[10:26:44] <_nickel> gseguin: toddparker: ok I've got a solution
[10:26:51] <_nickel> just need tests and a quick refactor and I'll push
[10:27:05] <_nickel> then comes the rebase of the decoupled-select
[10:27:14] <_nickel> cue ominous music
[10:58:14] <_nickel> toddparker: you'll be happy to know I'm just testing my fix
[10:58:16] <_nickel> I'll push
[10:58:21] <_nickel> then I'm going to refactor a bit
[10:58:32] <_nickel> there's a bit of duplication
[11:29:47] <_nickel> alright I'll be back in a bit I have to get back to my house from where I'm working
[11:57:02] <todd_> awesome news _nickel!
[12:36:02] <_nickel> and we're back!
[13:52:51] <rwaldron> gseguin yt?
[13:52:59] <gseguin> 'sup?
[13:53:02] <rwaldron> hey dude
[13:53:04] <rwaldron> quick question
[13:53:08] <gseguin> sure
[13:53:22] <rwaldron> in the latest build, is something up with the pagecreate event?
[13:53:58] <gseguin> not that I know of
[13:54:06] <gseguin> _nickel: ping?
[13:54:13] <_nickel> gseguin: pong
[13:54:43] <gseguin> rwaldron is wondering if there is something up with the pagecreate event in the latest build, ring a bell?
[13:55:23] <gseguin> what do you see rwaldron?
[13:55:31] <rwaldron> thats just it
[13:55:32] <rwaldron> nothing
[13:55:48] <gseguin> not being triggered?
[13:55:50] <rwaldron> i reduced a test case to this:
[13:55:50] <rwaldron> 	$(document).bind( "pagecreate", function( event ) {
[13:55:51] <rwaldron> 		 console.log( event );
[13:55:51] <rwaldron> 	});
[13:55:59] <rwaldron> and there should be 4 events fired
[13:56:20] <rwaldron> hm...
[13:56:21] <rwaldron> wait...
[13:56:35] <rwaldron> I mave been chasing a ghost for the last hour
[13:56:44] <rwaldron> oh. my. god.
[13:56:46] <rwaldron> nevermind
[13:56:50] <rwaldron> great work guys
[13:56:53] <rwaldron> keep it up
[13:56:59] * rwaldron hangs head in shame
[13:57:04] <gseguin> :)
[14:01:15] <rwaldron> gseguin maybe not
[14:01:32] <rwaldron> or maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly
[14:01:56] <rwaldron> if i have 4 data-role="page" divs, and i listen with live...
[14:01:57] <rwaldron> $("[data-role='page']").live( "pagecreate"
[14:02:02] <rwaldron> should this fire 4 times?
[14:03:03] <gseguin> it would seem logical
[14:03:11] * gseguin is checking the source
[14:07:29] <gseguin> rwaldron: how many times does it fire ?
[14:07:33] <rwaldron> once
[14:07:57] <rwaldron> but i'm seeing it fire for the rest of the pages after navigating to them
[14:08:02] <rwaldron> i might be able to work with this
[14:08:12] <rwaldron> i just need to set a flag at _some_ point
[14:08:17] <rwaldron> that says this page is created
[14:08:26] <rwaldron> and update the backbone model that runs it
[14:08:36] <rwaldron> so i migh tbe able to work with this
[14:08:41] <gseguin> I'm not familiar with that part of the code
[14:12:56] <gseguin> rwaldron: yeah so looking at the code we create the page widget when loadPage is called on that node
[14:13:07] <rwaldron> word.
[14:13:15] <rwaldron> i think i can set the flag on that then
[14:13:22] <gseguin> so it makes sense that you have only one pagecreate firing
[14:13:29] <gseguin> alright
[14:14:07] <gseguin> hey kinblas!
[14:14:32] <rwaldron> thanks for your help gseguin
[14:14:47] <gseguin> you're welcome sir
[14:15:49] <rwaldron> gseguin it worked
[14:15:54] <rwaldron> in case you were wondering
[14:16:03] <rwaldron> the desired behaviour has been achieved
[14:16:33] <rwaldron> i needed a way to run listview("refresh")... but only _after_ the initial bootstrap load
[14:16:36] <gseguin> rwaldron: I had no doubt about you making it work
[14:16:39] <rwaldron> like, when stuff gets added
[14:16:58] <rwaldron> i'm getting updates sent via socket.io
[14:17:04] <rwaldron> its pretty sweet
[14:17:13] <rwaldron> and i think i'm done for the day
[14:17:24] <gseguin> I'd love to see, is it public?
[14:18:08] <rwaldron> not yet
[14:18:14] <rwaldron> hm
[14:18:24] <rwaldron> ping me tomorrow
[14:18:35] <gseguin> k
[14:18:45] <rwaldron> i'll see about getting the ok to let you peek
[14:19:03] <gseguin> thanks
[14:19:06] <rwaldron> in the name of jQuery Mobile support of course
[14:19:07] <rwaldron> hahaha
[14:19:17] <gseguin> of course
[16:55:13] <_nickel> most unproductive day of all time
[16:56:00] <_nickel> I swear on all that is holy I'm going to fix this test suite if its the last thing I do (select)
[16:56:16] <gseguin> lol
[17:47:18] <_nickel> gseguin: progress has been made
[17:47:24] <_nickel> solutions have been found
[17:47:33] <_nickel> I think thinks are in much better shape
[17:48:25] <_nickel> although it appears my typing/spelling is not one of them :(
[17:51:43] <gseguin> :)
[17:52:14] <gseguin> good to hear about the found solutions, sorry for your typing ;)
[17:52:52] <gseguin> _nickel: so you fixed the select issue?
[17:52:59] <_nickel> gseguin: many hours ago
[17:53:05] <_nickel> but tests are failing
[17:53:08] <_nickel> so I shan't be pushing
[17:53:12] <_nickel> until they are fixed
[17:53:19] <gseguin> oh oh, sorry yes the tests
[17:54:34] <_nickel> I'm a douche about making sure the tests pass before I push
[17:55:06] <gseguin> no I think it's a good thing
[17:55:11] <_nickel> at jqcon there will most likely be a slide where I'm depicted cracking the whup
[17:55:15] <_nickel> *whip
[17:55:28] <_nickel> in my talk that is
[17:56:05] <gseguin> I'm going to miss that :(
[17:58:16] <_nickel> gar
[17:58:20] <_nickel> that sucks
[17:58:48] <gseguin> I know
[17:59:45] <gseguin> had I known about the date ahead of time we would have planned to have our baby a little later ;)
[18:07:03] <gseguin> see ya later
[18:08:55] <_nickel> gseguin: CONGRATS!
[18:09:03] <_nickel> gseguin: when are you due?
