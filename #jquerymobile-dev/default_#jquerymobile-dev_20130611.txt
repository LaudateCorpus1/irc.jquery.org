[07:30:52] <maxlynch> Working on a new jQM theme, slightly modified from the original. curious to get some thoughts: http://driftyco.github.io/jqm-neue/
[07:45:53] <gseguin> jlembeck: are you coming to PDX?
[08:54:32] <johnbender> gseguin|away: I'm going to see if can get an earlier flight. I was hoping to go to that dinner
[09:02:40] <johnbender> gseguin|away: no dice
[09:02:43] <johnbender> oh well
[09:03:32] <maxlynch> Has there been any revisiting of using vclick on collapsible headings? I'm leaning towards enabling it for my app, just to get the responsivity improvement https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2212
[09:11:19] <gseguin> johnbender: bummer
[09:11:45] <johnbender> gseguin: yes, I had it in mind to do some networking but I'll have other opportunities for that (eg, the meeting)
[09:12:08] <johnbender> C'est la vie
[09:12:53] <gseguin> johnbender: I think the dinner might last longer than 8, or we may get some drinks afterward
[09:12:59] <gseguin> ping me when you're there
[10:03:37] <jlembeck> gseguin|away: will not be coming down unfortunately.
[10:04:11] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: You're going to be up in Seattle/Vancouver? Which days?
[10:09:55] <toddmparker> hey ya
[10:10:07] <toddmparker> how is beautiful PDX
[10:40:50] <toddmparker> changes we're doing in 1.4 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog

[11:22:38] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: any update on that build-git task?
[13:04:19] <uGoMobi> hey jl
[13:04:24] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: 
[13:05:28] <uGoMobi> yeah I am in Seattle sat 15 - thu 20
[13:05:50] <uGoMobi> then Vancouver until mon 24
[13:06:04] <uGoMobi> flying back from PDX at tue 25
[13:06:33] <uGoMobi> hanging out on PHL now
[13:07:49] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: that theme looks nice
[13:09:12] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: this is what we have so far for new default theme http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/test/theming/
[13:09:23] <uGoMobi> http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/test/theming/theme-b.php
[13:09:49] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: that's awesome. Holler if you wanna grab a beer while you're in town, or if you need some advice on stuff to do/things to eat
[13:10:25] <maxlynch> uGoMobi: nice! Definitely an improvement
[13:10:31] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: oh that sounds great
[13:11:15] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: i m going to plan a bit next couple of days
[13:23:49] <maxlynch> uGoMobi: I definitely like the smaller rounded corners. Any thought on getting rid of the focus blur on slider handles?
[13:39:35] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: slider is keyboard accessible so I think it needs focus style
[13:41:08] <maxlynch> uGoMobi, makes sense, just seems to clash with the design being such a strong box-shadow
[13:41:23] <toddmparker> hi maxlynch and uGoMobi 
[13:41:29] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[13:41:49] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: yeah, might want to reduce that a bt
[13:41:53] <uGoMobi> bit*
[13:42:16] <toddmparker> it's a box-shadow, not outline so we can control over that
[13:42:28] <uGoMobi> yup
[13:42:33] <toddmparker> but keyboard nav is important 
[13:42:43] <uGoMobi> .ui-slider-handle.ui-focus
[13:43:11] <uGoMobi> actually that changed to .ui-slider-handle:focus I think
[13:43:28] <toddmparker> makes sense. native vs. js
[13:45:11] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: in 1.4 there won't be a span ui-btn-inner anymore
[13:45:35] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: but you can get the inner highlight by using the :before pseudo element
[13:45:51] <uGoMobi> :after is used for the icons
[13:47:09] <uGoMobi> there is only one conflict: ordered lists use :before for the counter
[13:47:30] <uGoMobi> brb
[13:49:53] <maxlynch> uGoMobi, okay interesting. So these new theme links are using a early version of 1.4? Notice there's no ui-btn-inner
[13:56:23] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: correct
[13:58:03] <maxlynch> toddmparker: just nit picking on the box-shadow :) what about just 3 or 4px blur? http://grab.by/nqR4
[13:58:21] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: we don't generate any markup for buttons anymore, except a div wrapper for input buttons
[13:59:17] <maxlynch> uGoMobi: cool. I think this is going to be a great release
[13:59:25] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: also, the focus style is themeable (for each swatch)
[13:59:44] <uGoMobi> yeah, pretty excited about the changes we are going to make
[14:00:47] <maxlynch> I was taking a look at changing collapsible set header click events back to vclick since they feel a bit slow to respond. This ticket is 2 years old, I wonder if anything has changed? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2212
[14:02:58] <jqcommit> [13api.jquerymobile.com] 15joopringelberg opened issue #126: broken link  02http://git.io/shemtw
[14:03:08] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: we are reviewing all widget JS
[14:03:37] <uGoMobi> maybe we can clean up some code there, because of the new markup, and speed things up
[14:47:37] <toddmparker> @maxlynch - since tapping the collapsibles changes the document, i think it runs into the old target mis-match problem
[14:47:47] <toddmparker> that's why we wait for click. agree it's slow.
[14:52:30] <maxlynch> toddmparker: yea, I was trying to reproduce that and decide if it was worth it to just switch it back to vclick for some custom stuff, since I would be okay with the occasional mis-target.
[14:52:53] <maxlynch> If that meant on average the performance of collapsibles was improved. Seems like the mis target is a much more rare case?
[15:02:28] <gseguin> toddmparker: PDX is like 50 shades of gray
[15:02:43] <gseguin> and plenty of green from all the water that falls off the sky
[15:06:49] <gseguin> jzaefferer: ping
[15:20:14] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: you there?
[16:27:21] <jzaefferer> gseguin: hey there
[16:27:35] <gseguin> hey, are you in PDX?
[16:27:38] <jzaefferer> yep
[16:27:43] <jzaefferer> at the board meeting today
[16:28:16] <gseguin> I'll bug you later, wanted to start testing cobertura code coverage report on Jenkins
[16:28:43] <jzaefferer> sure
[16:28:50] <jzaefferer> any update on that build-git task?
[16:29:01] <jzaefferer> would be a good opportunity to also include the commit hash in those files
[16:29:05] <jzaefferer> if that doesn't happen already
[16:29:25] <gseguin> no update on that
[16:29:31] <gseguin> I need to get on it
[16:29:43] <gseguin> my jQuery time has been reduced this quarter
[16:29:43] <jzaefferer> gseguin: QUnit's build-git task might be a useful starting point: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L47
[16:29:50] <jzaefferer> its just a few more files
[16:29:58] <jzaefferer> gseguin: I can put that together, too
[16:30:09] <gseguin> I can try working on that tomorrow
[16:30:11] <jzaefferer> can you look at the QUnit task? If there any special we'd need in Mobile?
[16:30:55] <jzaefferer> gseguin: looks like it needs to include all these files: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/2e864fd0c1157b950dee
[16:31:17] <gseguin> yep
[16:32:03] <gseguin> we could do it as a post process task that will run after the normal build
[16:32:36] <gseguin> or make a dist:git target that will generate *-git directly
[16:32:38] <gseguin> whichever
[16:37:21] <gseguin> jzaefferer: are you guys out of your board meeting?
[16:44:55] <jzaefferer> gseguin: nope, though its supposed to be done in 15 minutes
[16:45:30] <gseguin> oh ok, I've been harrassing Richard, didn't realize you weren't done, oops
[16:45:55] <jzaefferer> gseguin: what's build/tasks.old?
[16:46:30] <gseguin> it's old tasks, can be removed
[16:47:22] <jzaefferer> who needs source control :p
[16:47:45] <gseguin> heh :)
[16:48:19] <gseguin> it was easier to keep it there when I migrated
[16:48:31] <gseguin> then I forgot to remove it
[16:50:27] <jzaefferer> okay
[16:50:28] <jzaefferer> no big deal
