[07:24:14] <gseguin> mornin'
[07:34:26] <frequent> @gseguin: afternoon!
[07:34:50] <frequent> :-)
[07:34:55] <gseguin> huh? I thought you were on the left coast frequent
[07:35:10] <frequent> further left...
[07:35:15] <frequent> across the pond
[07:35:50] <gseguin> for some reason I thought you were in California
[07:36:18] <frequent> I wish. Cloudy France at the moment
[07:36:27] <uGoMobi> California of Germany frequent?
[07:36:33] <uGoMobi> ah close
[07:36:55] <uGoMobi> morning / afternoon
[07:36:57] <frequent> yes. same planet... :-D
[07:37:04] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:38:01] <frequent> am I the only one from the old world?
[07:39:33] <frequent> but the California of Germany sounds good, too...
[07:39:48] <frequent> (minus the sunshine & better beer)
[07:39:55] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:44:54] <mspisars> frequent: where in france?
[07:45:18] <frequent> Lille right now. Until Saturday.
[07:45:30] <frequent> Trying to make a nice JQM UI for an application.
[07:45:41] <gseguin> frequent: are you French or just living in France?
[07:45:44] <mspisars> this is where I want to be right now. https://maps.google.com/maps?q=carcassonne+france&hnear=Carcassonne,+Aude,+Languedoc-Roussillon,+France&gl=us&t=h&z=12
[07:46:49] <gseguin> mspisars: Carcassonne is a very nice city indeed
[07:47:13] <mspisars> yeah, what'
[07:47:24] <mspisars> what's this work thing cramping my style
[07:47:26] <mspisars> ?
[07:47:35] <frequent> @mspisars: it has "sun" in the name, so beats cloudy Lille... :-) Other than that, I'm German and boast a 10 word French vocabulary...
[07:48:02] <frequent> which makes it a breeze to get around here...
[07:48:10] <mspisars> i bet.
[07:48:35] <gseguin> about the size of my German vocabulary despite my 7 years of German classes
[07:48:39] <mspisars> the french preffered me speaking russian to them to english
[07:48:40] <gseguin> :)
[07:48:53] <mspisars> is that some kind of messed up hatred there?
[07:49:12] <mspisars> in fact they were very helpful when we spoke russian :)
[07:51:33] <frequent> Been a while since I checked me Russion i18n.... I only know "Grasnoy Kartoschka"
[07:51:40] <frequent> "Grasnoya"
[07:51:49] <mspisars> red potatoes
[07:51:55] <frequent> YES!
[07:52:09] <mspisars> lol
[07:52:55] <frequent> A Russian colleague taught me some stuff, when we went to Russia.
[07:53:02] <frequent> while ago
[07:53:03] <uGoMobi> useful Russian knowledge frequent :)
[07:53:09] <frequent> sure is!
[07:54:39] <mspisars> im not saying the French knew Russian, they just were willing to help when we spoke Russian
[07:54:51] <mspisars> i should say "more willing"
[07:55:21] <mspisars> in general people were pretty friendly and accomadating.
[07:57:27] <frequent> @mspisars: agree!
[08:03:59] <frequent> ... controlgroups are killing me again today...
[08:04:27] <frequent> (running inside requireJS)
[08:04:53] <uGoMobi> why? are they out of control?
[08:05:20] <uGoMobi> I remember you opened that issue some time ago
[08:06:40] <uGoMobi> frequent: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4773 still that issue?
[08:07:07] <frequent> yup - plain old links
[08:08:31] <frequent> In my other project with modified JQM, I'm enhancing all controlgroups by hand now = send enhanced markup from the server. Tired of calling trigger('create').page().refresh('please enhance').now()....
[08:08:51] <frequent> The reason:
[08:10:17] <gseguin> frequent: can you post a jsbin for that issue?
[08:10:22] <frequent> I have to set $.mobile.autoInitializePage and fire JQM manually once all other plugins needed for launching the app have been required. From what I understand, JQM is just faster with mobileinit, than everyone else with doc.ready.
[08:10:53] <frequent> 1sec
[08:11:00] <gseguin> I can try to take a look at it today
[08:12:05] <frequent> mh. Sounds good. Need to fiddle this in. I think the problem is in the comment in JQM 1.2a = "The pagecreate handler for controlgroup is in jquery.mobile.init because of the soft-dependency on the wrapped widgets"
[08:12:33] <frequent> and somehow this does not mesh when manually calling autoinitpage.
[08:12:42] <frequent> JSBINning in a minute
[08:13:23] <frequent> (Badminton FRA : GER coming up... and I'm outnumbered 10:1...)
[09:08:26] <frequent> @gseguin: ping
[09:09:08] <gseguin> 64 bytes from gseguin (127.0.0.1): icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=251 ms
[09:12:02] <frequent> found it ...didn't declare data-role="button" on one of the buttons... works fine now with requireJS - http://www.franckreich.de/t/index.html and without http://www.franckreich.de/t/index_plain.html.
[09:13:46] <gseguin> kewl, so there is no bug, then?
[09:14:42] <frequent> correct.
[09:15:21] <frequent> one sec. let me try something with both links.
[09:20:54] <johnbender> yo!
[09:21:37] <frequent> @gseguin. gotta go. Posting later.
[09:21:37] <johnbender> frequent: I got your message yesterday
[09:21:46] <frequent> cool.
[09:21:52] <johnbender> frequent: if you want to pass that link along, maybe put it in the nav refactor issue
[09:21:58] <johnbender> (which I can get for you, one sec)
[09:22:04] <frequent> Ok. Will do later
[09:22:10] <frequent> Need to go.
[09:22:24] <johnbender> ?tell frequent https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5091
[09:22:25] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[09:22:39] <gseguin> alright! thanks!
[09:22:57] <gseguin> hi johnbender
[09:42:22] <johnbender> gseguin: yo
[09:42:28] <johnbender> gseguin: excited for today's meeting
[09:42:40] <johnbender> the work on nav has been fruitful / interesting
[09:42:40] <gseguin> oh yeah?
[09:42:51] <gseguin> kewl!
[09:43:06] <johnbender> thinking about each piece as standalone functionality certainly helps
[09:43:19] <gseguin> For a minute I thought you had changed  your mind about joining the summit
[09:44:58] <gseguin> I see you've made progress in the simple-nav branch
[09:45:03] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[09:45:07] <johnbender> that's just the start
[09:45:18] <gseguin> Looking through the commits right now
[09:45:31] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm writting tests for the more important chunck
[09:45:36] <johnbender> which is a "navigate" method
[09:45:40] <johnbender> which does the history tracking
[09:45:49] <johnbender> along with the url alteration where replacestate is supported
[09:45:55] <johnbender> so it's instant
[09:46:15] <johnbender> next step after that is to try and do forward and backward navigation events
[09:46:28] <johnbender> my thought is that if you use the history trackin navigate method
[09:46:42] <johnbender> you get the forward and backward events because you've bought into history tracking
[09:47:12] <johnbender> after I get that finished I'm going to dive into the navigation code and start simplifying with those tools
[09:49:33] <johnbender> gseguin: the secondary goal is that people who just want to support the back button in their apps can then pull in the simple nav stuff and make use of it
[09:50:32] <gseguin> I definitely have to take a look at what you come up with
[09:50:38] <johnbender> gseguin: it's early
[09:50:45] <johnbender> but I want to get you guys looking at it soon
[09:51:04] <gseguin> one thing I just implemented here is insert a confirm popup when you back out of a compose form page
[09:51:05] <johnbender> gseguin: I can't keep all the different use cases in my head at one time so I'm implementing and I'll figure it out as I go
[09:51:25] <johnbender> generally I've thought through it enough to be confident in the approach but we'll see whether that lasts
[09:51:33] <johnbender> this is actually me second try at a navigate event
[09:51:38] <gseguin> I want to make sure that porting it to the new model isn't going to require too much work
[09:51:45] <johnbender> gseguin: shouldn't
[09:52:00] <johnbender> my original attempt had the history management rolled into the navigate event
[09:52:07] <johnbender> which bothered me
[10:01:46] <johnbender> gseguin: my primary concern is integration
[10:01:52] <johnbender> gseguin: modularity + integration
[10:02:07] <johnbender> $.navigate is replacing $.mobile.path.set
[10:02:44] <johnbender> our layering-on of pushstate support is clumsy in that it listened for events to be modular but could really have been in a much cleaner fashion when the url was set
[10:03:00] <johnbender> s/been/been done/
[10:03:09] <johnbender> or at least that's the appearance so far
[10:50:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do we have an agenda doc?
[10:56:01] <gseguin> I haven't seen toddmparker_ today
[11:00:13] <uGoMobi> hello guys
[11:01:21] <agcolom> hi Jasper!

[11:07:35] <toddmparker_> scott_gonzalez or ajpiano - can you guys -m #jquery-meeting
[11:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> Wilto beat me by half a second.
[11:08:34] <toddmparker_> thanks guys
[11:08:42] <toddmparker_> irccloud is being wonky
[11:08:46] <ajpiano> i was the one telling wilto how to do it :p
[11:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:09:00] <Wilto> I was gonna say: in fairness, ajpiano kinda won.
[11:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> If I had typed the command correctly, I would've been first.
[11:09:17] <ajpiano> i'm like that guy behind the scenes
[11:09:25] <ajpiano> if you look at the scenes you can't see me
[11:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> I almost always swap the mode and channel.
[11:09:27] <ajpiano> because i'm behind them

[11:37:02] <johnbender> working on the details now

[11:38:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Cool! Thanks!
[11:45:03] <agcolom> Thanks v much _|Nix|_ !
[12:14:36] <_|Nix|_> Believe it or not, this is a lot cleaner than it used to be: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/jqm.dot.svg
[12:17:14] <gseguin> oh you included the css! very nice _|Nix|_
[12:20:15] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Removed jquery and js/jquery.mobile.js ... cleaner now, but still quite crowded.
[12:20:22] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Refresh to see the new one.
[12:46:38] <gseguin> it'd be great to bubble up the objects with less dependencies
[12:46:49] <gseguin> and move all the css on one side
[15:26:30] <johnbender> I've got a fun one!
[15:26:33] <johnbender> OH man is this one fun
[15:26:38] <johnbender> holy crap what a crazy implementation
[15:26:51] <johnbender> this might be obvious to _EVERYONE_ else
[15:26:56] <johnbender> but to me this is totally crazy pants
[15:27:06] <johnbender> window.location.hash = foo;
[15:27:16] <johnbender> will _STOP_ the execution of whatever function that expression is in
[15:27:20] <johnbender> to trigger popstate bindings
[15:27:24] <johnbender> FULL STOP
[15:27:28] <johnbender> trigger bindings
[15:27:32] <johnbender> RESUME EXECUTION
[15:27:36] <johnbender> _wtf_
[15:31:04] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: gseguin: _|Nix|_: ^
[15:34:59] <toddmparker_> wha
[15:40:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to simple-nav: http://git.io/PjERGA
[15:40:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/simple-nav] tests for navigate event state should work with both popstate and hashchange - John Bender
[15:40:09] <johnbender> complete insanity
[15:44:02] <gseguin> wow
[15:48:21] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/c146203f88b63f368a70ea38a24dd0e391ee9393/tests/unit/navigation/navigate_method.js#L58
[15:48:39] <johnbender> gseguin: note that works for _both_ hashchange and popstate
[15:48:43] <johnbender> the test is not qualified
[15:49:40] <johnbender> gseguin: my goal is for those bindings to be more descriptive
[15:50:00] <johnbender> newcontent -> newcontent -> backwardnavigation
[15:50:02] <johnbender> or something like that
[15:50:50] <gseguin> one thing for tests like that, we should use: https://github.com/caolan/async
[15:51:00] <gseguin> makes the test much more readable
[15:51:54] <johnbender> gseguin: :/
[15:51:59] <johnbender> lol
[15:52:01] <johnbender> sorry
[15:52:04] <johnbender> I'm a hater
[15:52:14] <johnbender> gseguin: that's what we have with event cascade or similar
[15:52:55] <gseguin> yep
[15:58:12] <gseguin> how about data-filter-reveal instead of data-filter-hide-values ?
[15:58:30] <gseguin> johnbender, toddmparker_: ^
[16:00:25] <johnbender> gseguin: moar simple please
[16:00:28] <johnbender> definitely
[16:00:42] <gseguin> ok
[16:00:52] <gseguin> reveal it is then
[16:07:20] <johnbender> gseguin: what's the data attribute for?
[16:07:25] <johnbender> color me curious

[16:12:49] <gseguin> ?BOOM
[16:12:50] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[16:14:12] <johnbender> nice
[16:14:44] <johnbender> gseguin: I knew this was coming but our event cascade is tied to the pagecontainer
[16:14:52] <johnbender> just need to parameterize that
[16:16:35] <gseguin> oops yep
[16:16:56] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll deal with that later
[16:17:01] <johnbender> I'm fine with nesting right now
[16:17:17] <johnbender> gseguin: also, in my head it's better to not use abstraction as I'm writing these tests
[16:17:36] <johnbender> because the tests are a representation of what an average user might do to grab all this information
[16:17:41] <johnbender> at least in isolation
[16:17:51] <johnbender> so abstracting it can obscure the api shape
[16:18:01] <johnbender> especially where that abstraction is not available
[16:18:17] <gseguin> not sure I agree
[16:18:38] <gseguin> what I see is that a test that's not easy to read is not easy to maintain
[16:19:07] <gseguin> and not easy to maintain is no good
[16:19:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I fully agree with you
[16:19:27] <johnbender> and I'd like to fix that
[16:19:38] <johnbender> but I also want to see what it looks like in isolation
[16:19:42] <gseguin> sure
[16:19:55] <johnbender> short of building a sample app the testing abstractions will obscure that
[16:20:17] <johnbender> and I'd like to be able to make the determination if this event cascade is a problme or just part of the tests first
[16:20:22] <johnbender> right now it looks like it's part of the tests
[16:20:40] <johnbender> since you wouldn't be usin $.navigate inside those callbacks most likely
[16:20:45] <johnbender> in fact
[16:20:51] <johnbender> that very thing is something I considered
[16:20:52] <johnbender> and ran into
[16:21:03] <johnbender> I have a TODO for serializing calls to $.navigate
[16:21:19] <johnbender> so that someone can do it in sequence and get the expected output
[16:21:25] <johnbender> or at least a TODO to consider that
[16:21:39] <johnbender> so I had to do the nesting myself which made me consider that :)
[16:21:41] <gseguin> why implement it though?
[16:21:50] <johnbender> I'm not sure I will
[16:21:53] <johnbender> I'm waiting
[16:21:57] <gseguin> it's already pretty well done by libraries like async
[16:22:18] <johnbender> right
[16:22:25] <johnbender> but it was something I thought about
[16:22:32] <johnbender> I was _forced_ to think about
[16:22:36] <johnbender> anyhow
[16:22:40] <johnbender> I agree with what you're saying
[16:22:47] <johnbender> but I'll come back to it
[16:23:17] <gseguin> ok
[16:24:33] <gseguin> one thing it you want your function to play nicely with async is to adopt their convention that the first argument to callback is err
[16:24:44] <gseguin> but that is fine tuning
