[00:41:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Readme: added missing backticks. - Jasper de Groot
[02:02:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hi Gabriel, are you there?
[02:03:30] <uGoMobi> toddparker, johnbender and I were discussing popup yesterday
[02:05:26] <uGoMobi> just let me know when you have time to talk about popup
[03:45:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm here.
[03:45:45] <_|Nix|_> What's up?
[03:51:57] <_|Nix|_> I think I know what we need for popup ... the top of the popup must never have a negative coordinate, because then the top becomes unreachable.
[03:53:54] <_|Nix|_> If the popup is very tall, it will cause the document height to increase when shown, but, if the top coordinate is never negative, then it will always be fully reachable with the scrollbar.
[04:40:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: /window 3
[04:40:21] <_|Nix|_> Oops :) Sorry

[05:26:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping! Can you update http://ugomobi.github.com/popup/popup.html to use http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js?
[05:27:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'd love to see how my latest change has affected those photos ...
[06:00:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[06:00:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure, will update it now

[07:23:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I saw that you updated the page. What do you think about the popup placement now?

[07:23:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Popup: Removed CSS rules for iframe from default popup styling. Since iframes require custom styling anyway it is not useful to have this in the framework structure CSS. - Jasper de Groot
[07:23:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Popup: Added position relative for ui-popup because of the absolute positioned ui-btn-left/right close buttons inside this element. - Jasper de Groot
[07:24:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, nice job... I think we are getting close :)
[07:24:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am in favor of a default margin at the top
[07:24:47] <toddparker> hey all
[07:24:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now, I see that there was also talk about explicitly centering over the page with a data-* option ...
[07:25:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so you always have the close button in view
[07:25:03] <uGoMobi> hi toddparker
[07:25:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I tried that and it causes the page to jump because focus is being passed to the popup container.
[07:25:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[07:25:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I understand, hmm :(
[07:26:00] <toddparker> hey all
[07:26:05] <toddparker> catching up
[07:26:10] <uGoMobi> hi again toddparker :)
[07:26:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's why I chose Math.max( 0, ... ) for the popup position.
[07:26:39] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: so there is a jump with centering?
[07:26:52] <toddparker> or with that latest non-negative change
[07:27:04] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: There is a jump if the minimum top coordinate for a popup is > 0.
[07:27:14] <uGoMobi> jump is not with centering, with margin top right?
[07:27:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... with the latest non-negative thing, right.
[07:27:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: If I set the minimum y-coordinate to, like, 15, then it'll jump.
[07:27:46] <toddparker> i see
[07:27:53] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Lemme try to repro it for you.
[07:28:12] <toddparker> can it be positioned at 0 but we add top/bottom margin?
[07:28:37] <uGoMobi> toddparker: see portrait examples here http://ugomobi.github.com/popup/popup.html#page-b
[07:28:40] <toddparker> we could try that
[07:28:59] <uGoMobi> (has been updated and test page loads latest now)
[07:29:02] <toddparker> uGoMobi: do those use latest?
[07:29:19] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ^^^ yes :)
[07:29:22] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Remember that the popup container gains focus when opening a popup. So, assigning focus can cause the browser to scroll the page to make sure the focused element is in view.
[07:29:24] <toddparker> cool
[07:29:30] <toddparker> that 2nd example does look better
[07:29:49] <toddparker> ah
[07:31:49] <uGoMobi> right now I can get the image to be full height minus top/bottom margin with CSS
[07:31:55] <uGoMobi> can't*  ^
[07:34:52] <toddparker> nice uGoMobi
[07:35:04] <toddparker> any ideas on how to prevent that jump uGoMobi
[07:35:07] <toddparker> brb
[07:36:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/popup-jumps/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[07:36:46] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Only jumps in Chrome - not in FF.
[07:38:16] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Chrome Version 21.0.1171.0 dev
[07:38:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Check out ^
[07:38:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does it jump for you too?
[07:39:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: testing on Chrome/Win now
[07:39:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, toddparker: Click on the very first photo-link.
[07:40:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am looking at your daughter? :)
[07:40:43] <_|Nix|_> You are.
[07:41:17] <uGoMobi> cute !
[07:41:24] <_|Nix|_> Thanks!
[07:41:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see the same on Chrome and FF
[07:41:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ok, so it jumps, eh?
[07:42:26] <uGoMobi> yeah, it looks like center of pic is at center of screen
[07:42:26] <_|Nix|_> So, I guess, I'll keep it at 0.
[07:42:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, and when I set the focus, the left top of the popup container jumps to window(0, 0).
[07:43:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see, ok this doesn't work
[07:43:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess the browser wants to maximize the extent to which the focused element is visible on screen.
[07:44:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you have the ui-body-x class being added to div ui-popup instead of the container?
[07:44:31] <uGoMobi> then I can try some more with CSS
[07:45:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess ...
[07:45:27] <uGoMobi> or is that going to be an issue, because if you click on the space between ui-popup and the container it won't close
[07:45:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Interesting too that the max-width is getting ignored on Android 2.3.5 ...
[07:45:46] <uGoMobi> I mean, if I add the margin to div ui-popup somehow
[07:45:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, that's right. If the area is part of the container, it won't trigger the close.
[07:47:00] <uGoMobi> so that's not an option either
[07:47:30] <_|Nix|_> Man ... popups are totally broken on Android 2.3.5 ...
[07:47:43] <_|Nix|_> I'm not getting the hashchange when the user clicks "Back" ...
[07:47:50] <uGoMobi> I am going to try something
[07:47:54] <_|Nix|_> It only works when pushStateEnabled = false ...
[07:48:46] <uGoMobi> did we already had those issue with dialogs? or is that totally different?
[07:49:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: dialogs don't have that problem because they don't themselves listen to hashchange.
[07:49:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They are handled by _handleHashChange ...
[07:49:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see
[07:49:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but popup has to have its own hashchange listener.
[07:51:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It was uncanny: I added an alert to the top of _handleHashChange, and I added a hashchange listener which also outputs an alert, and I always get two alerts, except when I click "Back" - then, I only get the _handleHashChange alert ... *shake head* ...
[07:52:59] <uGoMobi> weird
[07:55:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Everything works fine if I set $.mobile.pushStateEnabled = false ...
[07:55:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I gotta figure that one out.
[07:56:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good luck with that, I wouldn't even know where to start :(
[07:57:04] <_|Nix|_> ... but the upshot is that popups are totally broken in Android 2.3.5 out of the box.
[08:25:03] <_|Nix|_> Man ... I could really use a proper debugger on my Android 2.3.5 browser ... I've already found stacktrace.js, so I've used that to confirm that, when pushState is enabled, it is onPopState that calls _handleHashChange, and a hashchange event never happens.
[08:38:09] <Wilto> Hey, I’m picking degradeInputs apart for a client gig — you guys figure there’ll be any noticable performance benefit to my rewriting it in straight-up JS?
[08:38:25] <Wilto> Prolly not, huh.
[08:42:35] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: that is really annoying
[08:42:42] <toddparker> we need to patch up 2.3.x for sure
[08:42:49] <toddparker> android is such a mess
[08:43:01] <toddparker> maybe johnbender can help us with that too
[08:57:27] <toddparker> we have a few android issues that are bad
[08:57:46] <toddparker> chrome freaks with fixed positioning
[09:01:10] <toddparker> sorry i stepped away for a few
[09:01:31] <toddparker> uGoMobi and _|Nix|_ - where are we at with the positioning stuff
[09:02:09] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I am looking at that margin/height issue
[09:02:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you have an idea how to make position center an option
[09:02:35] <uGoMobi> ?
[09:03:45] <toddparker> for that margin issue, i forgot that margin would kill the click to close
[09:03:48] <toddparker> dang
[09:05:06] <toddparker> btw - the map example now doesn't fit
[09:05:17] <toddparker> think that padding messed up the width
[09:06:30] <toddparker> hi tbenzige
[09:07:19] <tbenzige> hey toddparker!
[09:07:23] <uGoMobi> toddparker: you mean the close button?
[09:07:31] <tbenzige> i landed an 'add_version' script yesterday
[09:07:33] <toddparker> yeah
[09:07:38] <toddparker> or the tap outside to close
[09:09:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: moving back through history may or may not randomly fire hashchanges
[09:09:22] <uGoMobi> toddparker: mixing things up here, I was talking about map example
[09:09:39] <johnbender> we just assume that it will in the pushstate plugin because we don't have a choice
[09:10:12] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: I pushed an adjusted version of the JQM code to TR master
[09:10:21] <uGoMobi> to fix that issue
[09:10:59] <uGoMobi> hi johnbender ... just so you know... node + grunt worked out for me
[09:11:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: great!
[09:11:14] <uGoMobi> thanks for your help
[09:11:45] <johnbender> uGoMobi: np, if you want to customize the build for any reason it's in the README
[09:12:08] <uGoMobi> yeah, I saw that... might going to use it for custom theme
[09:12:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: how do we gzip the JS?
[09:13:11] <toddparker> gzip is a server setting, no?
[09:13:16] <johnbender> yar
[09:13:16] <toddparker> or minify?
[09:13:18] <uGoMobi> for php
[09:13:21] <johnbender> well
[09:13:25] <uGoMobi> also JS?
[09:13:34] <uGoMobi> no I mean gzip, not minify
[09:13:42] <johnbender> minification is part of the build process
[09:13:50] <johnbender> there's a minified version in the /compiled directory
[09:14:40] <uGoMobi> yes, so I can minify with grunt
[09:15:08] <uGoMobi> but I think I can also gzip it with a node module
[09:16:06] <johnbender> agcolom: quick question for you on the commit message format
[09:16:09] <johnbender> http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Git/Introduction#Good_commit_messages
[09:16:24] <johnbender> there are some already established ways make "good commit messages"
[09:16:30] <johnbender> are you guys married to that format we have in the readme?
[09:19:08] <toddparker> i'm good with whatever format gives me good info for the changelog
[09:19:17] <toddparker> some commits are…cryptic

[09:20:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Revert "Popup: Added position relative for ui-popup because of the absolute positioned ui-btn-left/right close buttons inside this element." - Jasper de Groot
[09:20:58] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[09:21:29] <MauriceG> hi Jasper, Thanks for take in the button PR!
[09:21:53] <uGoMobi> you're welcome. thanks for the fix
[09:22:36] <uGoMobi> was wondering why a regular button isn't part of the button widget
[09:22:44] <MauriceG> but I still think about the right position for .jqmEnhanceable() ...
[09:23:11] <uGoMobi> what do you mean?
[09:24:02] <MauriceG> behind the .not filter or before ...
[09:24:23] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:24:39] <uGoMobi> yeah, have been thinking about that too before I merged
[09:24:57] <uGoMobi> but I don't think it really makes a difference
[09:25:16] <uGoMobi> both prevent buttonMarkup being called
[09:25:44] <MauriceG> just cause of performance
[09:26:19] <MauriceG> the list of objects is smaller after the .not filter, no?
[09:26:35] <uGoMobi> because the .not() will apply more often than .jqmEnhanceable?
[09:26:53] <MauriceG> yes.
[09:26:59] <MauriceG> that also
[09:29:59] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I really don't know if it makes a difference
[09:30:09] <tbenzige> toddparker: ping
[09:30:45] <toddparker> tbenzige: pong
[09:30:55] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I guess that if I had to choose I would put .not() first but that would be based on a feeling only
[09:31:42] <toddparker> tbenzige: did i see that you landed a script to deal with new versions?
[09:32:36] <MauriceG> but if ignoreContentEnabled is false, it may make no difference, I think.
[09:33:07] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Don't want to disturb ...  Thanks!
[09:57:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you there?
[10:00:40] <tbenzige> toddparker: yes
[10:00:52] <tbenzige> i also updated the wiki on the repo for manual instructions
[10:01:14] <tbenzige> i need to know when 1.1.1 final will be up on the CDN so i can run the script to generate the TR 1.1.1 stuff
[10:47:30] <toddparker> ok tbenzige
[10:47:54] <toddparker> johnbender: I think we can do the final 1.1.1 build since nothing much came in during the rc
[10:48:05] <johnbender> toddparker: kk
[10:48:12] <toddparker> guess that means agcolom and i need to update the docs first

[11:04:29] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Jasper de Groot (6d, 10h ago): Button widget: Rewrote code that adds class ui-submit. Fixes #4642 - submit button in header renders incorrectly [1.1.2.]
[11:05:40] <uGoMobi> the issue only pops up if you manually add class ui-btn-left/right to an input button in the header... but still it annoys me
[11:10:37] <MauriceG> agcolom uGoMobi: Sorry for all the single PRs, but I'll never get my local repo in sync anymore - http://maugo.ma.funpic.de/heul.jpg
[11:12:54] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: how about new clone? :)
[11:14:52] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I see I missed a few "liberal spacing" issues when cleaning up the code last weekend, thanks :D
[11:15:26] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: one thing though... functions go snug to the front if they are the only argument
[11:15:44] <uGoMobi> at least, that is what jQuery's styleguide told me
[11:16:11] <uGoMobi> so... .each(function() { });
[11:41:13] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: oh really?  I will take another look.  Thank you!
[11:43:41] <agcolom> toddparker: Hi, I'm here :-)
[11:43:58] <toddparker> uGoMobi: if that change is very low risk and it's been thoroughly tested, i think we can pull that over
[11:43:59] <agcolom> Hi everyone :-)
[11:44:08] <toddparker> agcolom: how are you?
[11:44:25] <toddparker> i was just going to start looking at docs changes for 1.1.1 final
[11:44:49] <toddparker> before we start, does anyone think we need another rc? we didn't change anything and i didn't see anything new come in
[11:44:56] <agcolom> good, a bit tired, but happy, just had an award ceremony (I got a certificate for outstanding teacher :-) )
[11:45:08] <toddparker> we do still have issues with clicks not working right in android with fixed toolbars
[11:45:18] <toddparker> but i dunno how easy that will be to fix
[11:45:29] <toddparker> congrats agcolom
[11:45:37] <agcolom> Thk :-)
[11:45:42] <agcolom> thx ^
[11:46:27] <agcolom> where do the final docs change go? (1.1-stable?)
[11:51:06] <MauriceG> agcolom: Hi Anne :-)  Congrats !   (I hope you were able to carry the award home cause of your bad back ;-)
[11:52:06] <MauriceG> ups!   start to rain  my jeep is open !!
[11:53:03] <toddparker> yes agcolom
[11:53:24] <toddparker> we just need to do the run-through to change from 1.1.1-rc1 to 1.1.1
[11:53:33] <agcolom> toddparker: When do we do that? now?
[11:53:40] <toddparker> then john bender can build
[11:53:48] <agcolom> Thank you Maurice :-)
[11:53:50] <toddparker> and tbenzige can get TR ready
[11:54:06] <toddparker> yeah, i think we can start prepping
[11:54:13] <toddparker> in the 1.1-stable branch
[11:54:39] <toddparker> i already created a 1.1.3 milestone so we can start on more fixes after this goes out
[11:54:52] <agcolom> ok, since they are small changes for me, I can do them in GitHub directly...
[11:54:57] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:55:03] <toddparker> thanks
[11:55:44] <agcolom> MauriceG's ton of PR can be pulled in afterwards :-) (I can't face it tonight ;-) it's huge!!! )
[11:56:43] <agcolom> for the record: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Release-Instructions-Checklist
[11:57:24] <agcolom> going to do the following now:
[11:57:26] <agcolom> Update URL of demo code in:
[11:57:26] <agcolom>     docs/about/getting-started.html
[11:57:26] <agcolom>     docs/pages/page-anatomy.html there are two paragraphs in that document that need to be updated

[12:08:20] <uGoMobi> toddparker: the change is very low risk, but I will ask johnbender to have a look at it before picking anything
[12:08:49] <uGoMobi> FWIW - I don't think we need another RC
[12:09:51] <uGoMobi> maybe we shouldn't wait long with 1.1.2. if we have been able to fix those fixed toolbar issues
[12:11:48] <agcolom> ok, I've made the 4 docs changes. My understanding is that johnbender needs to make the change to version.txt and that this will get picked up to display the version in the ribbon. (I seem to remember noone else should make that change.)
[12:14:45] <agcolom> any idea when 1.2 will be released ?
[12:16:59] <toddparker> thanks agcolom - so all the docs edits are now in?
[12:17:24] <toddparker> 1.2 alpha could go out later this week if we can square away some issues with the popup
[12:17:26] <agcolom> toddparker: I think so. The 4 files that I identified last time
[12:17:51] <agcolom> so 1.1.1 will have the old copyright
[12:17:54] <toddparker> * positioning: vertical space on tall popups, option to center
[12:18:04] <toddparker> * android 2.3 not working
[12:18:27] <toddparker> ok agcolom
[12:18:46] <toddparker> i could probably just do a global on that copyright real quick
[12:18:58] <agcolom> it says &copy; 2011-12 The jQuery Foundation
[12:19:05] <toddparker> is _|Nix|_ around?
[12:19:12] <agcolom> I made the change master only.
[12:19:25] <toddparker> that's fine but it should be a simple change
[12:19:27] <agcolom> to master only
[12:19:43] <toddparker> yeah, i can make the same changes to 1.1-stable
[12:19:46] <MauriceG> toddparker: why not use a script for the copyright?
[12:19:59] <toddparker> to include it MauriceG?
[12:20:18] <toddparker> we need to re-think the docs to handle stuff like this
[12:20:29] <toddparker> but for 1.1.1, we're limping laong
[12:20:44] <MauriceG> in jqm-docs.js
[12:21:19] <agcolom> toddparker: the copyright also needs changing in Wordpress
[12:21:59] <agcolom> toddparker: in your announcement, will you point to the donation page?
[12:22:20] <toddparker> for devices? good idea
[12:22:52] <agcolom> yes, that one.
[12:22:53] <toddparker> so what's on /test/ is 100% right
[12:23:09] <agcolom> test (master?)
[12:23:42] <agcolom> all docs in master are 100% correct.
[12:24:01] <agcolom> just that framework -> docs which I can do now.
[12:24:35] <agcolom> then I can pull-in MauriceG's PRs but I need to know whether they'll need cherry-picking.
[12:24:37] <toddparker> yes, master
[12:24:57] <toddparker> what is the framework > docs?
[12:25:07] <agcolom> in the title of some examples
[12:25:19] <agcolom> (re my email)
[12:26:10] <uGoMobi> toddparker: Re popup: on Chrome & Safari 3rd example looks good now except on initial page load (!), on FF & Opera 2nd and 3rd example both still don't look good yet :( http://ugomobi.github.com/popup/popup.html#page-b
[12:26:18] <toddparker> woah!
[12:26:27] <toddparker> 1.1.-stable branch is a mess
[12:27:07] <uGoMobi> what's wrong with 1.1-stable?
[12:28:25] <toddparker> merge conflicts
[12:28:36] <toddparker> pull that branch and view
[12:29:26] <agcolom> for the docs this is expected because all files in page folder have loading widget and popup which is not in 1.1-stable
[12:29:31] <agcolom> Is that for the docs?
[12:30:01] <toddparker> wait, what's that agcolom
[12:30:08] <toddparker> it should look clean
[12:31:05] <agcolom> how do I check? all the files in the page folder have the loder and popup menu item.
[12:31:13] <agcolom> (in hte left hand-side menu)
[12:34:39] <toddparker> where do you see that?
[12:34:52] <toddparker> when you view the branch locally?
[12:35:15] <agcolom> no I mean the docs left hand-side menu for pages
[12:35:44] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html
[12:35:49] <toddparker> oh, hold on
[12:35:55] <toddparker> might be something on my end
[12:36:29] <toddparker> branch preview looks ok
[12:36:30] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/1.1-stable/index.html
[12:36:41] <agcolom> so none of the change in the pages folder could be cherry-picked into 1.1-stable
[12:36:42] <toddparker> lemme re-check my local
[12:36:58] <toddparker> for the footer
[12:37:10] <agcolom> the footer will be the old one
[12:37:20] <agcolom> (the saturday change is not there)
[12:37:20] <toddparker> i was going to just directly make those changes again while in the 1.1-stable branch
[12:37:35] <agcolom> yes, they need to be made by hand
[12:37:44] <agcolom> they cannot be cherry-picked
[12:37:46] <toddparker> …on the branch preview
[12:37:55] <agcolom> ok
[12:37:56] <toddparker> ^^ the sat. change
[12:38:02] <toddparker> i'm happy to do it
[12:38:08] <agcolom> ok
[12:38:09] <toddparker> just need to fix up my git
[12:38:12] <agcolom> ok
[12:38:18] <agcolom> you really scared me!
[12:40:02] <agcolom> so does that mean the 1.1-branch is not messed up?
[12:41:20] <johnbender> jzaefferer: what starts the browserstack workers in the testswarm setup?
[12:41:50] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I've got everything running but it's not clear to me where those calls are made in our jobs
[12:43:18] <toddparker> i think it's me agcolom
[12:43:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Popup: on Chrome & Safari 3rd example looks good now except on initial page load (!), on FF & Opera 2nd and 3rd example both still don't look good yet  http://ugomobi.github.com/popup/popup.html#page-b
[12:43:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: also a problem with scrollable popups is the overlay... see example 2 ^^^
[12:44:00] <agcolom> toddparker: Good (well, good for me ;-) I can start breathing again!) )
[12:44:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the overlay ends at the fold, when you scroll there is no overlay at the bottom of the page :(
[12:44:43] <agcolom> toddparker: that copyright change is in 137 files I think
[12:45:07] <toddparker> thanks agcolom, that's helpful to know when i run my replace
[12:45:21] <uGoMobi> toddparker: if you have a problem with git I can do a search and replace in those files
[12:45:51] <agcolom> I also added a footer to one page. May be worth doing the same in 1.1-stable.
[12:47:10] <agcolom> toddparker: this one had no footer info. I added it. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/3d3c340cf49c20fba9c00f2007439b771e1023d6
[12:47:11] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Anne-Gaelle Colom (3d, 10h ago): Docs: added copyright info and closed unclosed page div
[12:49:44] <agcolom> todd_ you may want to add that one to 1.1-stable as well
[12:51:20] <agcolom> toddparker I get very confused with your identity changes ;-)
[12:51:45] <agcolom> so I was saying this one had no footer info. I added it. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/3d3c340cf49c20fba9c00f2007439b771e1023d6

[12:52:01] <agcolom> you may want to add that one to 1.1-stable as well
[12:52:54] <toddparker> ok
[12:53:04] <toddparker> our internet just died so this is proving difficult
[12:53:21] <toddparker> doing a fresh clone of the repo
[12:53:24] <toddparker> at 16%
[12:53:30] <toddparker> sheesh
[12:53:38] <agcolom> oh dear!
[12:54:09] <agcolom> toddparker: what can we do to help?
[12:55:05] <toddparker> give me more internets
[12:56:20] <agcolom> sorry not sure how to do that one ;-) but I know how that feels if that makes you feel any better?
[12:57:50] <agcolom> make an annoucement: noone else in the office is allowed to use the internet!!!!
[12:59:54] <toddparker> at 59%
[13:00:00] <toddparker> heh
[13:00:13] <toddparker> we have a bunch of visitors working this week, not helping
[13:00:22] <agcolom> ok, so slow but getting there
[13:02:16] <agcolom> no no no. get someone to find an activity they can do offline... like design a logo ;-)
[13:05:08] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile TestSwarm Master build #10: STILL FAILING in 5 min 7 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20TestSwarm%20Master/10/
[13:06:24] <agcolom> toddparker: 100% yet?
[13:06:41] <toddparker> 68%
[13:06:47] <toddparker> sheesh
[13:09:44] <agcolom> this is crazy slow!
[13:15:06] <toddparker> 73%
[13:15:14] <toddparker> our repo is pretty big
[13:15:22] <toddparker> but our web connection is really bad today
[13:18:51] <johnbender> 5 hours later I finally figred out why the popup tests are failing in test swarm
[13:20:15] <todd_> back
[13:20:16] * uGoMobi is curious if johnbender is going to tell what it was
[13:20:21] <todd_> maybe with a better connectio
[13:20:29] <johnbender> something to do with the query params and firefox
[13:20:33] <johnbender> no idea yet
[13:20:37] <johnbender> has _|Nix|_ been floating around
[13:21:00] <agcolom> todd_ actually, it looks like it's not 137 files, but 126. I must have counted one of my commit twice.
[13:21:22] <agcolom> so you need 126 changes
[13:21:29] <agcolom> (not 137)
[13:22:34] <agcolom> toddparker it looks like it's not 137 files, but 126. I must have counted one of my commit twice. so you need 126 changes, not 137
[13:29:26] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ running the popup tests with a complex query string seems to break many of them. Test swarm appends a bunch of info to the url, you can reproduce in Firefox with (/tests/unit/popup/?_=1341950437173&swarmURL=http://swarm.jquery.org/index.php?status=2&run_id=4228&client_id=5612&run_token=61958de2f054136c24650b27549760494ac4398c&results_id=49420&results_store_token=3f4cf9a7ab712eb96a22afedef8c3d4683a72357)
[13:29:27] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[13:29:38] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ only with Firefox
[13:29:39] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[13:33:56] <toddparker> 100%
[13:34:06] <agcolom> hey!!!! celebrate!
[13:34:12] <toddparker> :)
[13:36:26] <Krinkle> johnbender: hi, do you still need help with it? I noticed you asked a swarm q earlier
[13:36:29] <agcolom> toddparker: when are you writing the release message? (I guess won't be much different to 1.1.1-rc.1) would just add a note on device donation page... maybe something on statistics? (I can't remember if that was already in rc1)
[13:37:35] <johnbender> Krinkle: nope, I sorted out was was causing the test failure
[13:37:40] <Krinkle> k
[13:37:54] <johnbender> Krinkle: the difficulty was that the url link in the results is not an accurate representation of the url used to run the tests
[13:37:57] <johnbender> and I figured as much
[13:38:20] <johnbender> our nave does a lot of url manip so there's something in there that isn't agreeing with firefox :(
[13:38:43] <toddparker> agcolom: yes, it will be very similiar
[13:38:54] <johnbender> s/nave/nav/
[13:42:20] <agcolom> toddparker: just before I forget: 3 things you may want to mention in the blog for 1.1.1:
[13:43:19] <agcolom> device donation page, download builder, statistics (feel free to reject, just an idea/brain storm)
[13:44:01] <agcolom> and the SF Conference?
[14:00:15] <toddparker> i did a post on the download builder separately
[14:00:25] <toddparker> i should do the same for the donation page
[14:00:41] <toddparker> ok, let me get these changes in
[14:00:45] <toddparker> johnbender: you around?
[14:01:19] <johnbender> toddparker: I am
[14:01:23] <johnbender> I was about to head to the gym
[14:02:22] <toddparker> hey bender
[14:02:35] <toddparker> agcolom and i are updating the 1.1-stable docs
[14:02:47] <toddparker> after that, i think we're ready to go with 1.1 final
[14:02:57] <johnbender> toddparker: cool
[14:02:59] <toddparker> so you could do the build later today or tomorrow
[14:03:21] <toddparker> after that, we need to tell Tyler the CDN is ready so he can update TR
[14:03:26] <toddparker> and i'll work on the blog post
[14:03:31] <toddparker> that's the plan
[14:03:36] <johnbender> toddparker: cool
[14:03:38] <toddparker> so agcolom just checking
[14:03:43] <toddparker> the footer should be:
[14:03:44] <toddparker> <p>&copy; 2012 jQuery Foundation and other contributors</p>
[14:03:48] <toddparker> right?
[14:03:57] <agcolom> yes
[14:04:08] <uGoMobi> about the TR... we need an adjusted version for that, the one with the fix for controlgroups
[14:05:35] <toddparker> ok uGoMobi
[14:05:39] <toddparker> did you mention that to tyler?
[14:05:47] <toddparker> agcolom: i got 121 files
[14:05:58] <toddparker> including version.txt
[14:06:19] <toddparker> not sure what 5 i missed
[14:06:32] <toddparker> actually, i bet those were new 1.2 pages for popup
[14:06:48] <uGoMobi> I was about to say that :)
[14:07:02] <uGoMobi> popup has about 3 or 4 pages
[14:07:07] <uGoMobi> and autodividers
[14:08:33] <toddparker> ah. 122 with that missing footer page
[14:08:50] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I did tell Tyler that we are going to create an adjusted version for TR
[14:09:21] <agcolom> no, you need 126 before the missing footer
[14:09:32] <agcolom> let's check the folders
[14:09:59] <toddparker> just pushed
[14:10:02] <toddparker> brb
[14:10:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/5ThQ-w
[14:10:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Updated copyright on all docs pages - toddparker
[14:10:09] <agcolom> no you're good
[14:10:25] <agcolom> you haven't got the popups
[14:10:37] <agcolom> and you haven't got the loading widget
[14:11:50] <agcolom> 5 files are 4 for popups and 1 for loading widget. So you're not missing anything
[14:12:12] <agcolom> toddparker^
[14:12:24] <agcolom> as they are not in 1.1-stable
[14:12:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: auto dividers isn't in 1.1 either right?
[14:13:09] <uGoMobi> popup has one file "map" that hasn't got copyright... it's the iframe for the map example
[14:15:02] <agcolom> autodividers is not there so we've got 1 too many! ??
[14:17:31] <agcolom> toddparker: you've changed licence-info.txt that's teh extra one
[14:20:03] <agcolom> toddparker, you need to check this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/c75695b6231305d874f1e15033fe0c2b416a3a5f#MIT-LICENSE.txt

[14:21:20] <agcolom> toddparker: I can do the 3 missing ones if you like
[14:25:39] <uGoMobi> ?tell johnbender (when he is back from the gym) if he would be so kind to take a look at this commit http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html to see if it's ok to pick that one for 1.1.1. final
[14:25:40] <bot-t> uGoMobi, Okay.
[14:28:07] <uGoMobi> ?tell johnbender that I copied the link from the wrong tab :(   this is the commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/866bb5da445e07fc8c977e860064db3a24dc2d2d
[14:28:07] <bot-t> uGoMobi, Okay.
[14:28:08] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Jasper de Groot (6d, 13h ago): Button widget: Rewrote code that adds class ui-submit. Fixes #4642 - submit button in header renders incorrectly [1.1.2.]
[14:32:27] <agcolom> is there a way in IRCCloud to get someone's name written for you (I keep typing the names so to get uGoMobi, i type it! And I keep thinking surely there must be a better way to do this (i.e. a shortcut that would be good also for error prevention!) (And if there is a shortcut and I am the only one who was not aware of it, please don't laugh ;) )
[14:34:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: just type "u" and then tab
[14:35:14] <toddparker> agcolom: yeah, i searched for 2011-12 and found the license.txt
[14:35:19] <agcolom> uGoMobi: OMG! Noone told me this before!!!!
[14:35:19] <toddparker> so i found an extra one
[14:35:37] <agcolom> toddparker: we need to do 3 more
[14:35:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I also get an alert when you type Jasper
[14:35:50] <uGoMobi> just so you know ;)
[14:36:08] <toddparker> ah, the tab trick
[14:36:09] <toddparker> makes irc so much better to use
[14:36:22] <agcolom> uGoMobi: where was that written???
[14:36:24] <toddparker> took me a while to find that
[14:36:32] <toddparker> you just need to know
[14:36:48] <toddparker> agcolom: so what 3 did i miss?
[14:36:54] <agcolom> i kept thinking it was not possible that everyone was just typing all these names!!!
[14:36:59] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I guess I found an help page, don't remember
[14:37:10] <agcolom> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/c75695b6231305d874f1e15033fe0c2b416a3a5f#MIT-LICENSE.txt

[14:38:47] <uGoMobi> agcolom: at the upper right corner... "shortcuts" :)
[14:38:53] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Thank you so much for that! it was driving me mad! _|Nix|_ was a particular hard one to type!
[14:39:11] <uGoMobi> haha yeah I can imagine
[14:40:02] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, I read that one many times but completely missing the tab for some reason!
[14:40:47] <uGoMobi> only human to see everything except the first thing or something that is right in front of you :D
[14:42:51] <toddparker> ok, i changed 3 more files

[14:46:05] <toddparker> i missed one
[14:46:14] <agcolom> toddparker: you have just updated them
[14:46:16] <toddparker> oh, no i didn't
[14:46:21] <toddparker> all set

[14:46:28] <toddparker> sorry for my confusion
[14:46:36] <toddparker> ok johnbender - i think we're all set
[14:47:04] <uGoMobi> I see something
[14:47:11] <toddparker> yeah?
[14:47:18] <uGoMobi> Valencia theme is in 1.1-stable
[14:47:23] <uGoMobi> but we never updated it
[14:47:27] <agcolom> the only difference is you have added the jquery.com to the js files, which scott didn't have... does that matter?
[14:50:49] <toddparker> hmm
[14:51:51] <agcolom> ok, bedtime for me...
[14:52:12] <agcolom> goodnight everyone. I think we're good for the docs (1.1.1)
[14:52:21] <toddparker> fixed
[14:52:25] <toddparker> i think so too
[14:52:29] <toddparker> thanks agcolom
[14:52:37] <toddparker> valencia is way outdated
[14:52:43] <toddparker> think we should ditch it
[14:52:44] <agcolom> I've added those 2 files to the checklist for copyright
[14:52:48] <uGoMobi> good night agcolom

[14:56:13] <toddparker> uGoMobi: thanks
[14:56:45] <toddparker> we should add a vertical photo to our docs page
[14:57:32] <toddparker> looks like the positioning option is still in progress
[14:57:32] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok, let's just pick one for now so we can at least test
[14:57:41] <agcolom> toddparker: it's on a new line I think
[14:59:33] <toddparker> we should switch over to 1.7.2 for core
[15:01:56] <uGoMobi> toddparker: you can remove valencia from 1.1-stable, it's still in master anyway. whave to move it to a branch or something before 1.2alpha
[15:02:05] <uGoMobi> we have*

[15:17:10] <uGoMobi> right
[15:17:25] <uGoMobi> have to check if they are not too heavy for mobile
[15:17:41] <uGoMobi> but for now it's ok
[15:17:46] <uGoMobi> thanks
[15:18:13] <agcolom> toddparker: are you ok putting the link to jquery.com back in MIT-LICENSE.txt?
[15:20:03] <agcolom> both pictures are under CC http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en and we need to mention the author I think... not sure how best to do that. toddparker: do you know how we should do that?
[15:23:15] <toddparker> i thought those shouldn't have the links
[15:23:19] <toddparker> agcolom ^^
[15:23:34] <toddparker> if i missed something, feel free to hop in
[15:23:41] <toddparker> working on the 1.1.1 blog post
[15:23:53] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i tweaked those change log items you mentioned - thanks
[15:24:16] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok cool
[15:24:24] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i agree we should move valencia out for 1.2
[15:24:42] <toddparker> i like that pic agcolom
[15:25:49] <uGoMobi> I can photoshop the author in the pic, just small in the corner
[15:25:58] <uGoMobi> if needed

[15:31:58] <agcolom> toddparker: will add the link tomorrow morning... if you want it aligned with master...
[15:32:08] <agcolom> Goodnight...
[15:33:33] <toddparker> ah, ok uGoMobi
[15:33:56] <uGoMobi> my website is ugomobi.com ... puts me under more pressure to get my new JQM/Wordpress website finished
[15:34:18] <toddparker> heh
[15:34:24] <toddparker> i'm linking that up now
[15:34:42] <johnbender> toddparker: did you want me to tag/push 1.1.1 ?
[15:34:43] <bot-t> (1 hour 9 mins 3 secs ago) <uGoMobi> tell johnbender (when he is back from the gym) if he would be so kind to take a look at this commit http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html to see if it's ok to pick that one for 1.1.1. final
[15:34:44] <bot-t> (1 hour 6 mins 30 secs ago) <uGoMobi> tell johnbender that I copied the link from the wrong tab :( this is the commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/866bb5da445e07fc8c977e860064db3a24dc2d2d
[15:34:44] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Jasper de Groot (6d, 14h ago): Button widget: Rewrote code that adds class ui-submit. Fixes #4642 - submit button in header renders incorrectly [1.1.2.]
[15:34:58] <toddparker> johnbender: yep, we're all set
[15:35:12] <toddparker> uGoMobi: do you have a twitter account?
[15:35:30] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm fine with it
[15:35:33] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[15:35:36] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yeah, but not really active their yet
[15:35:49] <johnbender> uGoMobi: feel free to cherry pick
[15:35:53] <johnbender> sorry to get back to you so late
[15:35:58] <johnbender> I know it's getting late there
[15:36:09] <uGoMobi> want to start blogging and twittering when new site is up and running
[15:36:14] <toddparker> ok
[15:36:25] <toddparker> i can leave you name unlinked if you want for twitter
[15:36:27] <uGoMobi> thanks johnbender ... no worries :)
[15:36:28] <toddparker> let me know
[15:36:50] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yeah, that's fine for now
[15:37:26] <uGoMobi> thanks though
[15:38:00] <uGoMobi> johnbender: can you do me a favor and pick that one?
[15:38:21] <uGoMobi> my git says my local 1.1-stable branch is ahead of remote origin
[15:39:09] <uGoMobi> I think it is because I created a new local branch out of 1.1-stable to pick commits for 1.1.2 already
[15:39:39] <uGoMobi> not sure
[15:40:06] <uGoMobi> but I don't want to cause any problems just before release
[15:40:20] <toddparker> once that is tagged, tbenzige can get theme roller ready
[15:40:48] <toddparker> tbenzige: if we can get the codiqa guy to help so they know the flow, all the better
[15:40:56] <toddparker> that way, we can leave yo alone
[15:43:31] <johnbender> uGoMobi: can you check HEAD on 1.1-stable to make sure I got it?
[15:43:49] <uGoMobi> johnbender: sure
[15:45:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes it is in there, thanks a lot!
[15:48:20] <uGoMobi> toddparker johnbender : what is the best way to make the TR load that adjusted JS?
[15:48:35] * johnbender has no idea
[15:49:41] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I was thinking, if we load a script with (adjusted) controlgroup.js after JQM JS from CDN, does it override?
[15:51:25] <uGoMobi> never actually tried that with JS, I know PHP will give an error
[15:54:10] <tbenzige> toddparker: np. it's not much work
[15:54:12] <uGoMobi> toddparker: johnbender: the Valencia theme still needs to be deleted from 1.1-stable right?
[15:54:24] <tbenzige> ill email him. when will the 1.1.1 build be up?
[15:54:29] <tbenzige> toddparker: ^
[15:56:09] <toddparker> uGoMobi: that is a Q for tbenzige
[15:56:26] <toddparker> we can move valencia out, yes
[15:56:40] <toddparker> tbenzige: johnbender is working on it now i believe
[15:56:58] <tbenzige> toddparker: awesome.
[15:57:01] <toddparker> i need to head out all
[15:57:12] <tbenzige> see ya. have a good night!
[15:57:13] <uGoMobi> hi tbenzige ! I was just talking about how we can make sure the TR gets that fix for the controlgroups
[15:57:14] <toddparker> email me tonight if anything needs immediate attention
[15:57:18] <toddparker> 'night
[15:57:26] <uGoMobi> good evening toddparker
[15:57:43] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: what was your TR question?
[15:58:00] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: the controlgroup fix
[15:58:21] <tbenzige> isn't baked into the 1.1.1 build?
[15:58:31] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: no
[15:58:39] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: oh… ok
[15:58:51] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: it's an issue that we have to look into more careful
[15:59:05] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: I just did a quick fix that works for sure for the TR
[15:59:08] <tbenzige> I have my own copy of the JS, so I can just replace the old code manually
[15:59:20] <uGoMobi> but we can't pull that in 1.1.1. final
[15:59:33] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: where is the fix now?
[16:00:00] <uGoMobi> I have it local and I pushed to master of TR repo
[16:00:24] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: oh yeah. i saw that this morning
[16:00:27] <tbenzige> it works great
[16:00:27] <uGoMobi> if you TR loads a local version it is not a problem at all
[16:01:14] <uGoMobi> after johnbender tagged and deployed I can put the fix in and create a adjusted version of the JS
[16:01:27] <uGoMobi> minified as well
[16:02:04] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: yeah. if you could just email the minified version, that might be better. because I haven't built out the 1.1.1 final directory yet
[16:02:10] <tbenzige> then i can replace it
[16:02:20] <uGoMobi> sure
[16:02:31] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: where can I find your email?
[16:02:39] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: thanks so much. email = tbenzige@adobe.com
[16:03:34] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: ok great, will email you the JS as soon as 1.1.1. final is ready
[16:03:52] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: great. thanks again
[16:24:29] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I got my local 1.1-stable branch in sync again... I will remove Valencia theme now and then we are ready for 1.1.1. final as far as I know
[16:31:24] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/eUP-kQ

[16:34:24] <uGoMobi> ok I am off... good night all!
[16:55:45] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll wait until tomorrow to make sure nothing else needs to sneak in
