[01:57:04] <bot-t> uGoMobi, Okay.

[02:29:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Have you had a chance to look at those non-reopening panels? I'm planning to have a look, so if you have any good pointers where I should start, I could certainly use your guidance.
[02:29:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's weird. The animationComplete handler is simply not getting called.
[02:29:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no I didn't look into it yet
[02:29:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I bet it's a FF bug.
[02:29:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. NP.
[02:30:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: one thing to look at is the overflow setting for the page
[02:30:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[02:30:25] <uGoMobi> I remember that caused an issue with FF before
[02:30:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/docs/_assets/css/jqm-demos.css#L13
[02:31:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[02:31:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see if removing that fixes it
[02:32:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Checking now.
[02:32:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we actually need that CSS to prevent other issues
[02:32:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Gotta love https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5659 ... typical ... we never think about dynamic content.
[02:32:53] <uGoMobi> yeah
[02:33:06] <uGoMobi> we also didn't add refresh method for tables
[02:33:19] <uGoMobi> something we have to learn from
[02:33:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and we definitely need an API for returning the container - like we have for controlgroup.
[02:33:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's OK for widgets to have public methods. For some reason we never add any.
[02:35:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep - the overflow thing is causing it.
[02:35:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I will look into that
[02:36:40] <uGoMobi> the reason it's there is to avoid a vertical scrollbar on the page div if you use the search and the results list is longer than the page
[02:37:01] <uGoMobi> and also on some pages you got that scrollbar when opening the global nav panel
[02:37:12] <uGoMobi> thanks for testing

[04:39:58] <scott_gonzalez> Then find the last name from AUTHORS.txt and copy the new ones.
[05:27:29] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: Easy. Thanks
[05:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[05:27:51] <toddmparker> We updated authors last night, all ready to roll
[05:27:53] <arschmitz> Morning toddmparker
[05:27:58] <toddmparker> Hey arschmitz 
[05:29:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker: had you wanted the keywords and highlight on the autocomplete too?
[05:29:44] <arschmitz> i wasent sure if there was really room and if it would make sense there or not?
[05:29:56] <toddmparker> Be fun to try
[05:30:03] <arschmitz> ok no problem
[05:30:37] <arschmitz> now that i have it working on the results dynamicly it should not be any problem to add just might need some different style of course
[05:30:38] <toddmparker> I was thinking that the autocomplete logic might shift to just search li text for the first two letters
[05:30:56] <arschmitz> yeah you mentioned that yesterday i like that
[05:31:01] <toddmparker> Then we use the filtertext fit 3+
[05:31:22] <arschmitz> i think that makes a lot more sense
[05:31:22] <toddmparker> The matching keyword thing is trickier there
[05:31:39] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[05:31:56] <toddmparker> It would be too long to add a second row
[05:32:13] <arschmitz> yeah im thinking really small lol
[05:32:38] <toddmparker> Tho it doesn't bug me that I don't see the matching text
[05:32:49] <toddmparker> As long as I see the page I want
[05:32:57] <arschmitz> well i can add it and if it looks good great if not will remove it 
[05:33:01] <toddmparker> Been using search 100% to nav now
[05:33:07] <kam187-rMBP> Hi guys
[05:33:11] <toddmparker> Cool
[05:33:39] <arschmitz> i have it local right now and it looks ok just need to adjust a little 
[05:34:43] <toddmparker> Ugomobi good call on the contrib guidelines
[05:34:56] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[05:35:04] <toddmparker> Hey
[05:35:11] <uGoMobi> ok will add it
[05:35:15] <toddmparker> K
[05:35:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker: uGoMobi: its amazing how fast the search feature evoloved 
[05:35:37] <arschmitz> it didnt even exist 2 days ago
[05:35:54] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz ... yeah :)
[05:36:20] <arschmitz> its such a great nav feature too
[05:36:33] <toddmparker> It is. All I use now 
[05:36:47] <arschmitz> yeah people are going to want to be able to do this i feel like lol
[05:37:03] <toddmparker> Yep. Some good demo ideas 
[05:37:10] <kam187-rMBP> oh this is for dev only :)  Sorry off to #jquery then!
[05:37:50] <arschmitz> yeah im thinking good extension in the future
[05:38:07] <arschmitz> to make an an arrow key autocomplete like that
[05:38:49] <toddmparker> +1000
[05:43:32] <toddmparker> Be cool to enhance the autocomplete demo we have with arrows 
[05:44:10] <_|Nix|_> Clicking from intro on responsive tables results in a broken jQM logo on the top of that page. Works if you reload. base tag issue?
[05:46:44] <toddmparker> I dunno
[05:47:07] <toddmparker> I've seen that sporadically too
[05:47:20] <toddmparker> Mind looking into it?
[05:47:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK.
[05:47:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... since I have a well-reproducible case ...
[05:48:45] <_|Nix|_> OK ... breaks both in FF and Chrome. So, it's probably us.
[05:51:31] <_|Nix|_> It attempts to load _assets/img/jquery-logo.png instead of docs/_assets/img/jquery-logo.png
[05:51:45] <_|Nix|_> Strange. Why tables and not popup or any of the other links.
[05:51:47] <_|Nix|_> ?
[06:11:01] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/ser-Ig
[06:11:01] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 1432959cd 15Jasper de Groot: Demos: list filter styling, keyword highlight styling, stylesheet cleanup
[06:15:43] <_|Nix|_> For some reason when the tables page arrives via AJAX, even though the base tag is set before the page is attached to the DOM, the path for the logo is still calculated relative to the old base.
[06:17:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: question about the css for the seach autocomplete
[06:17:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[06:17:59] <arschmitz> where are you setting the width i cant find it
[06:18:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/docs/_assets/css/jqm-demos.css#L241
[06:19:00] <_|Nix|_> OK. I don't get why the path for the logo is calculated relative to the old base.
[06:19:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what about the max width? thats causing the text to wrap?
[06:20:08] <toddmparker> The broken logo thing is bizarre
[06:20:17] <_|Nix|_> Can anybody else repro this? 1. Open http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/intro/ and 2. Click on "responsive tables".
[06:20:22] <toddmparker> I see no difference in code
[06:20:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The base tag is set wrong.
[06:21:01] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... even though we set it from the AJAX success handler before we ever attach the incoming HTML to the DOM.
[06:22:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the container div jqm-search determines the (max) width
[06:22:15] <toddmparker> Yep, broken image
[06:22:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: by setting min-width for the list I make it wider
[06:22:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, correction, actually: The base tag is set correctly by the time the incoming HTML is appended to the DOM, and yet the URL for the image is still calculated wrt. the old base tag.
[06:22:42] <arschmitz> i see
[06:22:48] <toddmparker> Huh
[06:23:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and only for that one page.
[06:23:18] <toddmparker> Right
[06:23:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the keywords should wrap now
[06:23:40] <toddmparker> Other pages have the same code, same dir depth
[06:23:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I just added that rules for div keywords-results
[06:24:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was actually thinking the using ... might be better
[06:24:15] <arschmitz> so it does not add height
[06:24:21] <arschmitz> what do you think?
[06:24:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I can try to recreate the page step-by-step and see if it still breaks.
[06:26:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but then if your keyword isn't visible you don't see the highlight either
[06:26:29] <arschmitz> true
[06:26:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and I am not sure if the span can break the ellipsis
[06:26:51] <uGoMobi> I mean.. not sure if that works well together
[06:26:58] <arschmitz> ok
[06:27:08] <toddmparker> arschmitz: Should we disable auto suggest on the search input
[06:27:18] <toddmparker> uGoMobi?

[06:27:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we might have to look at where we inject the keyword div.. now it is appended but might need to go in ui-btn-inner
[06:28:07] <arschmitz> toddmparker: you mean the native one?
[06:28:12] <toddmparker> Ya
[06:28:19] <arschmitz> probably
[06:28:35] <toddmparker> Think that autocomplete needs a min width 
[06:28:46] <toddmparker> Waiting for view to update...
[06:29:03] <uGoMobi> sorry not sure if I follow you guys
[06:29:11] <uGoMobi> where do you want to disable?
[06:29:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: cp -a docs/widgets/collapsibles docs/widgets/tct and modifying the "responsive tables" link to tct results in a broken image.
[06:30:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: mv docs/widgets/tct docs/widgets/xyzzy and modifying the "responsive tables" link to xyzzy results in a broken image.
[06:30:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Weirdest thing I've ever seen.
[06:30:56] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: The native auto suggest in iOS pr whatever
[06:31:07] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:31:14] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:31:16] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: Odd
[06:31:28] <uGoMobi> that can be done with an attribute right?
[06:31:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Ha! You need to have a trailing slash on the link href.
[06:31:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: This is the weirdest thing ever.
[06:32:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No trailing slash = broken base ...
[06:32:08] <toddmparker> Ah!
[06:32:15] <toddmparker> Good catch 
[06:32:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, I'm not exactly perceiving this as a lesson learned. More like "what a st00pid bug".
[06:32:36] <toddmparker> You mean the link right?
[06:34:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah: <a href="../widgets/table-column-toggle/">responsive tables</a>
[06:34:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: <a href="../widgets/table-column-toggle">responsive tables</a> breaks.
[06:34:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Oh, and it breaks in FF as well!
[06:34:54] <toddmparker> Why dies the page load but not the img?
[06:35:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No clue.
[06:35:17] <toddmparker> Seems like a bug
[06:35:24] <toddmparker> Mind logging 
[06:35:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: In both webkit /and/ gecko?
[06:36:05] <toddmparker> Can you search for links w/o the slash?
[06:36:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I wonder if it has to do with the way Apache serves the page. When serving up a/b/c it serves up a/b/c/index.php ...
[06:36:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that is document in old docs
[06:36:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It might write something into the response.
[06:37:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/page-navmodel.html first thing under known limitations

[06:43:27] <toddmparker> Really polished 
[06:45:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: D000d! I had some of those sets when I was a kid ... *sniff* ... that takes me back!
[06:45:22] <arschmitz> toddmparker: you talking about when you click the images on the side in the photos box right?
[06:45:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I remember drooling over the rest of them in the catalogue :)
[06:45:38] <arschmitz> logos rule
[06:46:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So does Lego!
[06:46:10] <arschmitz> ha ha
[06:46:28] <arschmitz> i dont think my autocomplete likes legos though it seems
[06:46:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I live only, like 45 minutes (flight) away from Legoland :)
[06:46:42] <arschmitz> nice
[06:46:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: now I am completely lost :D are you talking about disabling native autocomplete or min-width for the results list?
[06:47:28] <arschmitz> lol
[06:47:42] <arschmitz> im adding the keywords and highlighting to the autocomplete in header
[06:48:05] <uGoMobi> right
[06:48:28] <arschmitz> so right now it expands the width of the results to fit the keywords
[06:49:16] <uGoMobi> right now as on master or after changes you made local/
[06:49:17] <uGoMobi> ?
[06:49:44] <arschmitz> well it does not add the keywords or highlight at all on master
[06:49:59] <uGoMobi> I know but I mean with the CSS from master
[06:50:23] <arschmitz> i didnt pull your latest
[06:50:36] <arschmitz> but thoes changes are only for the results list on the results page

[07:19:32] <arschmitz> ill remove it right now
[07:20:20] <toddmparker> arschmitz: Nice
[07:20:35] <arschmitz> toddmparker: its barely any longer
[07:20:42] <toddmparker> Think the tags can go even a tad smaller and we can add a bit of spacing
[07:20:58] <toddmparker> I see some wacky capitalization
[07:21:01] <arschmitz> yeah i went .7 em but can go smaller for sure
[07:21:06] <arschmitz> yeah lol i saw  that 
[07:21:12] <arschmitz> like button needs to be caps
[07:21:33] <toddmparker> Search RWD
[07:21:59] <toddmparker> gRids: conTent
[07:22:01] <arschmitz> oh i see
[07:22:08] <toddmparker> That in the HTML?
[07:22:11] <arschmitz> nope
[07:22:15] <toddmparker> Huh
[07:22:17] <arschmitz> its the code highlight
[07:22:21] <arschmitz> ill fix it right now
[07:22:52] <arschmitz> when it wraps in the span its blowing away the caps
[07:23:08] <toddmparker> What if we only showed the keyword line if there's a hit there?
[07:23:24] <arschmitz> hmm i can try that too
[07:23:27] <toddmparker> Not sure that's a good idea
[07:23:35] <arschmitz> yeah might look weird
[07:23:40] <arschmitz> when some have it and some dont
[07:24:24] <toddmparker> Feel like the keywords are out dirty laundry
[07:24:57] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[07:24:58] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1372: FIXED in 14 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1372/
[07:25:01] <toddmparker> But I think this approach us probably better
[07:25:21] <arschmitz> lol
[07:25:34] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: You want to look at styles?
[07:25:42] <toddmparker> Liking the blue
[07:25:52] <arschmitz> yeah it goes away when you arrow down too
[07:25:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: looking at it
[07:25:56] <arschmitz> which i like
[07:26:20] <toddmparker> K
[07:31:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: toddmparker : what do we do with the keywords for faq pages
[07:32:08] <arschmitz> those need to be actually gone through and set right now its just a copy of question
[07:32:15] <arschmitz> but they should be actually set i think
[07:32:21] <uGoMobi> I temporarily used the title
[07:32:30] <uGoMobi> in nav-faq.php
[07:32:54] <uGoMobi> but they should be replaced by meanful keywords
[07:33:40] <arschmitz> for sure
[07:34:13] <uGoMobi> the placeholder in the filter on the faq page should say something like ... seach by keyword
[07:34:58] <uGoMobi> because it won't hit the title of the faq anymore when you use the filter
[07:36:18] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:36:19] <toddmparker> so the faq title isn't used?
[07:37:11] <uGoMobi> if you use filter text the title is ignored
[07:37:27] <toddmparker> the autocomplete has a whole lotta text…uGoMobi might want to try a 700 weight on the title
[07:37:45] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok
[07:39:01] <arschmitz> ok so im adding two new function to demos that might be useful elsewhere
[07:39:22] <arschmitz> jQuery.fn.highlight and jQuery.fn.removeHighlight
[07:39:54] <arschmitz> $(selector).highlight('foo'); will highlight foo anywhere in the selector 
[07:39:54] <toddmparker> cool
[07:40:03] <arschmitz> and removeHighlight removes of course

[07:42:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: fixes issues with caps also
[07:42:42] <uGoMobi> where do we want to disable native autocomplete... only global search or also the other listview filters?

[07:53:36] <_|Nix|_> Weird - if you go to docs/widgets/forms/ and you go to "learn more about sliders" where "sliders" is a link and you click the link, the logo is not broken, even though the href has no trailing /.

[09:13:53] <_|Nix|_> What's our policy on multiple blank lines in our HTML files? Can I get rid of those? I just got rid of all trailing whitespace.
[09:14:13] <arschmitz> i think there should only be a single line anywhere
[09:14:18] <_|Nix|_> Like, if there are three consecutive blank lines, replace it with only one.
[09:14:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Can do.
[09:21:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi: alright so the stuff I need to do 
[09:21:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: 1. .php -> .html
[09:21:32] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes
[09:21:34] <johnbender> uGoMobi: 2. inline the menu
[09:21:38] <toddmparker> hu johnbender 
[09:21:42] <toddmparker> (hi)
[09:21:46] <johnbender> uGoMobi: 3. ...?
[09:21:50] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes
[09:21:50] <johnbender> profit?
[09:21:52] <uGoMobi> 3.
[09:22:15] <arschmitz> johnbender: ha ha nive refrence!
[09:22:18] <arschmitz> nice
[09:22:19] <uGoMobi> replace all links to .php files by links to .html files
[09:22:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ah
[09:22:30] <johnbender> kk
[09:22:34] <johnbender> that should be interesting
[09:22:40] <uGoMobi> i know
[09:22:43] * johnbender gets his sed/find hammer hout
[09:22:45] <johnbender> *out

[09:22:52] <uGoMobi> johnbender: 4.
[09:22:56] <uGoMobi> exception
[09:23:04] <arschmitz> johnbender: just regex .php and replace with .html and i think it will be ok 
[09:23:19] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah set/find
[09:23:23] <johnbender> err sed/find
[09:23:29] <johnbender> err find/sed
[09:23:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: exception?
[09:23:43] <arschmitz> yeah sorry missed that comment when typing
[09:23:50] <uGoMobi> in /docs/examples/redirect/ only index.php needs to be replaced
[09:24:47] <gnarf> do you use php filename.php to generate the html?
[09:25:00] <arschmitz> johnbender: 1) collect underpants 2) .... 3) profit! sounds easier lol 
[09:25:02] <gnarf> if so you could use a php function for the link target, and skip the sed
[09:26:25] <gnarf> you could do something like MOBILE_BUILD=true php filename.php and it spits out .html links instead of .php links
[09:26:26] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ah
[09:26:44] <johnbender> gnarf: not at all sure what you mean
[09:26:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What about using SSI includes instead of PHP? Is that deprecated?
[09:27:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We can sed that, if necessary.
[09:27:06] <gnarf> you're parsing a php file to turn it into html yeah?

[09:27:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That way we won't be tempted to start making use of PHP for stuff.
[09:28:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Either way, please be careful with docs/examples/redirect/redirect.php - that's /supposed/ to be a PHP.
[09:28:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, and docs/examples/redirect/source.php is also supposed to be a PHP.
[09:28:59] <johnbender> gnarf: there's only a single php include
[09:29:24] <johnbender> gnarf: it's the menu
[09:29:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: server side includes still require a server idea is to not require a server
[09:30:13] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/PJyJGg
[09:30:13] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14556a022 15Gabriel Schulhof: Docs: Remove excess blank lines
[09:30:47] <gnarf> johnbender: yeah, what i meant was that you can actually use the php cli to generate the .html - then skip the need to sed by checking for an environment variable present in the build process when generating links
[09:31:08] <johnbender> gnarf: then I need the php command line on my box :/
[09:31:15] <johnbender> gnarf: but it's a good suggestions
[09:31:18] <johnbender> *suggestion
[09:31:34] <johnbender> gnarf: all the links everywhere would have to be php then
[09:31:42] <johnbender> as you suggested a php function
[09:31:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, but since we're gonna use sed to replace the include statement with the included file, we might as well express the include statement using SSI syntax, not using PHP syntax.
[09:32:16] <gnarf> ssi isn't a bad choice either... its pretty easy to turn on in nginx
[09:32:37] <gnarf> anyway, afk 30 or so
[09:32:44] <johnbender> gnarf: _|Nix|_: maybe before the patch release
[09:32:46] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Exactly, and we won't be tempted to make use of other PHP features. SSI doesn't have too many useful features.
[09:32:48] <johnbender> I'm just going to hack this into the build
[09:33:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I like the idea of SSI
[09:33:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I might even have the command line for pasting in the file ... 
[09:33:29] <arschmitz> true either way works essentially the same
[09:33:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... from an old project.
[09:33:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: don't worry about it for now
[09:33:47] <arschmitz> would eliminate the need for .php extensions ha ha ha 
[09:33:57] <johnbender> that would be nice
[09:34:05] <johnbender> I'm just going to get this shit done for this release and we can figure it out later
[09:34:20] <arschmitz> yeah i think for today just get it out
[09:34:27] <arschmitz> and decide on best solution later
[09:35:19] <arschmitz> but i think SSI long term is probably better if all we are going to use from php is include()
[09:35:29] <arschmitz> no special extensions
[09:35:41] <toddmparker> so .shtml?
[09:36:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Maybe file an issue so we don't forget ...
[09:37:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Nono. Just plain .html ...
[09:37:06] <toddmparker> is agcolom around?
[09:37:29] <toddmparker> johnbender: no pressure, just wondering when you think the build will be ready for us to test
[09:37:46] <toddmparker> i'm heading into a client meeting but will plan on taking a break to test and do the announcement
[09:37:48] <johnbender> toddmparker: not sure just getting started
[09:37:54] <toddmparker> ok
[09:37:54] <johnbender> hopefully it won't take me more than a few hours
[09:38:01] <toddmparker> i'll get the site ready

[09:50:48] <toddmparker> ^ right?
[09:51:08] <arschmitz> yes

[09:51:38] <toddmparker> cool, just checking
[09:51:45] <arschmitz> :)
[09:57:43] <_|Nix|_> Shouldn't we add a big, fat "DEPRECATED!" blurb to the nested list section here: docs/widgets/listviews/index.php?
[10:01:38] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: good call
[10:02:03] <toddmparker> mind adding that note?
[10:02:19] <toddmparker> i need to run to a working session but will keep tabs here
[10:02:28] <toddmparker> give me a shout when you need me
[10:07:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: sorry, double checkin on the examples/redirect/ directory
[10:07:36] <johnbender> uGoMobi: index.php -> index.html
[10:07:41] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and arschmitz - are you guys still cleaning up the styles for the autocomplete?
[10:07:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: correct

[10:07:55] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am just finished with that
[10:08:13] <uGoMobi> johnbender: let me double check
[10:08:17] <toddmparker> ok, so it's not up on view?
[10:08:25] <toddmparker> did you go with bold
[10:08:29] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no didn't push yet

[10:20:50] <toddmparker> Stuff feels fast

[10:38:54] <toddmparker> if you don't like, revert

[10:39:20] <toddmparker> bg is hard to get right because it's distracting

[10:40:14] <arschmitz> ha ha actually help if i actually looked at server not local in my browser lol
[10:40:28] <toddmparker> true
[10:40:46] <arschmitz> ah does not work with the arrow key highlight!
[10:40:55] <toddmparker> in a meeting so if i don't respond, i'm not in a huff
[10:40:56] <arschmitz> letters dissappear lol
[10:41:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looking at adding autocomplete="off" to list filter input
[10:41:11] <toddmparker> right blue on blue. that would need fixing if we go this way
[10:41:13] <uGoMobi> can I find the input on pagecreate you think?
[10:41:33] <arschmitz> no

[10:41:43] <arschmitz> its not there for sure until page show
[10:41:45] <arschmitz>  :(
[10:41:48] <arschmitz> i ran into that
[10:41:57] <uGoMobi> aha
[10:42:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i like it but neet to add different rule for when its active state
[10:42:22] <arschmitz> when you arrow key down the letters kinda go invisible 
[10:42:52] <arschmitz> maybe switch to black when inside ui-btn-active?
[10:43:05] <toddmparker> could probably just be white
[10:43:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I thought you meant the active state, but it's highlight
[10:43:14] <uGoMobi> i like it
[10:43:14] <arschmitz> either way just not blue
[10:43:20] <toddmparker> right
[10:43:36] <arschmitz> i like it too much less distracting
[10:43:42] <uGoMobi> actually I liked the old brighter blue more for active state bg
[10:43:57] <arschmitz> so im testing arrow key nav as an extension to listview right now
[10:44:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: feel free to adjust that
[10:44:12] <toddmparker> i went down one step
[10:44:34] <uGoMobi> probably depends on screen but I like it bright :)
[10:44:54] <johnbender> uGoMobi: so it looks like there are a bunch of includes

[10:45:32] <johnbender> hmm
[10:45:36] <johnbender> this is going to take a bit
[10:45:36] <uGoMobi> nav-faq
[10:45:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: those are just in the search include it looks like
[10:46:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BTW - does your code for the search submit looks for search-result.php
[10:46:09] <uGoMobi> ?
[10:46:24] <uGoMobi> will break if the build changes it in .html
[10:46:31] <arschmitz> nope its all js
[10:46:34] <arschmitz> no php
[10:46:45] <uGoMobi> I mean the landing page
[10:46:48] <arschmitz> oh
[10:46:54] <arschmitz> yeah it does but i can change that
[10:46:56] * gseguin cheers to "no php"
[10:47:36] <toddmparker> hurrah
[10:47:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how can you change it? it needs to be php in the repo because it has global nav and search includes
[10:47:37] <gseguin> would be a great knuckle tatoo!
[10:47:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe should move to a folder
[10:47:50] <gseguin> Wilto: ^ idea for your next one
[10:47:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good idea
[10:47:56] <arschmitz> then it can be search-results/
[10:47:59] <uGoMobi> call it index
[10:48:05] <uGoMobi> right
[10:48:05] <arschmitz> yup
[10:48:27] <arschmitz> ok im working on something right this sec then ill change
[10:49:24] <johnbender> toddmparker: this is going to take me a while
[10:49:32] <johnbender> I thought we centrlized the include
[10:49:37] <johnbender> but they are sprinkled everywhere
[10:49:50] <johnbender> so I have to get the order right for the content replacement
[10:50:13] <gseguin> johnbender: I came to the same conclusion
[10:50:36] <Wilto> gseguin: Sorry, no room for “NO PHP” given these big “PHP4 LYFE” knuckle tatts suckaaaas
[10:51:00] <gseguin> lol
[10:51:18] <toddmparker> johnbender: that's ok. if it's gonna push us to tomorrow, we can require php for now
[10:52:53] <gseguin> johnbender: I was thinking it would make it easier if these php include tags were one tag per line
[10:53:27] <johnbender> gseguin: yes it would
[10:53:33] <gseguin> as opposed to a multiline php tag
[10:53:33] <johnbender> toddmparker: probably better to just do that for now
[10:53:50] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'll keep playing around with it for a bit, but I need to get some food
[10:53:53] * johnbender is starving
[10:54:01] <gseguin> then a simple /m regex will take care of it

[10:54:57] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1380: STILL UNSTABLE in 13 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1380/
[10:55:01] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok great
[10:55:03] <toddmparker> can you make the text white on the autocomplete hilight?
[10:55:08] <gseguin> johnbender: the other thing is files that contain just html should be .html, and it would be easy to do a 2-pass process
[10:55:13] <toddmparker> my brain is too scattered to work out that selector
[10:55:30] <gseguin> johnbender: 1st pass sources the html into the .php files
[10:55:35] <toddmparker> johnbender and gseguin - should we just require php then and do a test build?
[10:55:46] <toddmparker> uGoMobi has one quick thing to fix
[10:55:54] <gseguin> johnbender: 2nd pass sources the php files into the .html files
[10:56:01] <toddmparker> anything else that needs fixing in the demos before we to a test deploy?
[10:56:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we still need to change the keywords
[10:56:39] <johnbender> gseguin: not sure what you mean
[10:56:58] <toddmparker> what needs changing?
[10:57:08] <uGoMobi> and I haven't finished fixing panel issue FF / Safari yet
[10:57:16] <gseguin> I think that once all the files are formatted properly it shouldn't be too hard to whip up a grunt task that would do the replacement
[10:57:32] <toddmparker> ok
[10:57:36] <gseguin> johnbender: there are files that are .php that contain only html
[10:57:47] <gseguin> these should have .html extension
[10:57:55] <toddmparker> let's shoot to do a test deploy in the next 2 hours
[10:58:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: now we show the keywords filter text like "navbar, persistent navbars persistent header persistent footer persistent navmenu" looks a bit weird
[10:58:44] <gseguin> johnbender: then we can do a first pass that replaces the <? php include foo.html ?> by the content
[10:59:02] <johnbender> gseguin: that's what I was doing
[10:59:10] <johnbender> gseguin: but like you said the multiline gets in teh way
[10:59:15] <gseguin> johnbender: and then do it for the <? include foo.php ?>
[10:59:22] <johnbender> gseguin: would could close the multiline tags ourselves
[10:59:45] <johnbender> that's what I was going to play with once I get something to eat
[10:59:46] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah we should close them in the source first
[10:59:55] <johnbender> gseguin: alright I'll monkey with that
[10:59:55] <gseguin> johnbender: would make it much easier
[11:00:02] <johnbender> just for the sake of having that done anyhow
[11:00:05] <johnbender> then get back to the build
[11:00:14] <gseguin> ok
[11:00:20] <gseguin> johnbender: get some food
[11:00:23] <johnbender> gseguin: glad you're keeping tabs
[11:00:31] <johnbender> since the build is changing under the covers
[11:00:44] <Wilto> Have we considered using Java?
[11:01:19] <Wilto> PROBLEM: SOLVED but no I’m in the office if there’s anything I can do to help from this side.

[12:30:10] <Wilto> Yo.
[12:45:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Checking.
[12:45:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: A little too sharp - like there's no antialiasing, even though there is.
[12:46:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah that's what I meant.. same here
[12:46:24] <uGoMobi> probably because we let the browser resize it
[12:47:23] <uGoMobi> image should be exactly twice as big as the size we set
[12:51:09] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Sure, move the favicon
[12:52:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: logo looks bad on pc
[12:52:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: can you add logo at different size?
[12:52:45] <uGoMobi> I will look at what size it should be
[12:53:11] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Logo is oversized and sized in the browser
[12:53:18] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:53:24] <toddmparker> Ff might not do as clean a job
[12:53:29] <toddmparker> It's ok
[12:53:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: but it helps if it is exactly twice the size
[12:54:11] <toddmparker> We use the logo at 3 sizes now
[12:54:21] <toddmparker> X2 = madness
[12:54:25] <uGoMobi> I know
[12:55:25] <uGoMobi> the img size width by the width we set should be an integer
[12:55:30] <toddmparker> Soon it'll be SVG
[12:55:43] <uGoMobi> we don't need 3 img files
[12:55:59] <toddmparker> We can use SVG with a fallback
[12:56:06] <toddmparker> Prolly not today
[12:56:10] <uGoMobi> ok

[13:49:40] <agcolom> toddmparker: I can stay up for say another 1.5h
[13:49:41] <toddmparker> home > search > back and widget list is hidden
[13:50:09] <agcolom> then I can always add another 30 mins ;-)
[13:50:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes I mentioned that earlier today
[13:50:29] <uGoMobi> home > tab to widget list filter > list gone
[13:50:55] <arschmitz> wow crazyness
[13:51:23] <arschmitz> really need to make the filter an extension! to avoide all the weirdness it has now

[13:52:31] <agcolom> arschmitz: Hi, how are things?
[13:52:41] <arschmitz> great
[13:52:48] <arschmitz> Deaglan gets to come home tomorrow
[13:52:54] <agcolom> fantastic! 
[13:52:54] <arschmitz> WOO!
[13:53:03] <arschmitz> and buying a new car as we speak
[13:53:18] <agcolom> whohoo!!
[13:53:19] <toddmparker> great news arschmitz 
[13:53:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome! I guess you don't have to go very far to buy a car, eh?
[13:53:26] <toddmparker> mini van?
[13:53:33] <arschmitz> nope and nope
[13:53:39] <arschmitz> office next door
[13:54:10] <toddmparker> so is this bug fixable on the homepage?
[13:54:16] <agcolom> arschmitz: do you remember the url for the listview examples with the alphabet on the right hand-side?
[13:54:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How is it around there wrt. winter tires? Are all-season tires normally used? Winter tires might be safer.
[13:54:27] <agcolom> the one that you did the other day?
[13:54:37] <uGoMobi> great news arschmitz !
[13:55:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In Finland, studded winter tires are the norm, but winter tires are required between first frost and Easter.

[13:55:58] <toddmparker> love the search
[13:56:35] <arschmitz> just a sec need to step out for a sec
[13:56:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am checking the includes solution for johnbender ... can you look at homepage widget list bug
[13:57:09] <uGoMobi> maybe it's my code to clear the list when you close the search bar on small screens
[13:57:24] <uGoMobi> that's in jqm-demos.js
[13:57:34] <gseguin> arschmitz: happy to hear that!
[13:57:55] <uGoMobi> i trigger a click on the clear button somewhere in that code
[13:57:58] <agcolom> toddmparker: Yes, that's the one! Fantastic! Thank you :-)
[13:58:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im in there already ill look

[14:01:13] <agcolom> uGoMobi: what was it?
[14:01:15] <uGoMobi> no had to do with overflow settings that I adjusted 
[14:01:21] <uGoMobi> for the page
[14:01:34] <uGoMobi> it's actually something I need to fix in panel widget
[14:01:44] <uGoMobi> but added the fix in the demos JS for now
[14:01:51] <uGoMobi> have to wait until 1.3.1
[14:02:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Make a PR and milestone it to 1.3.1 - it's what I did.
[14:02:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: by the time I have time for that we released already and I can commit ;)
[14:02:40] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:03:02] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I totally messed up git and cloned again
[14:03:12] <johnbender> uGoMobi: k
[14:03:22] <uGoMobi> johnbender: now I don't remember how I get the grunt tools
[14:03:28] <uGoMobi> I had a folder 
[14:03:33] <uGoMobi> node_something
[14:03:35] <johnbender> uGoMobi: should be in the readme
[14:03:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi: but it's `npm install`
[14:04:19] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I have grunt installed globally
[14:04:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that's fine
[14:04:33] <johnbender> you still need to npm install
[14:04:42] <uGoMobi> ah that was it
[14:05:02] <uGoMobi> got it, thanks!
[14:05:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its not your trigger
[14:05:21] <arschmitz> that is scoped to the header and .jqm-search

[14:19:57] <_|Nix|_> Sorry about the URL.
[14:20:04] <_|Nix|_> docs/widgets/headers/bars-fixed.php
[14:21:20] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! It's a simple UL - not even data-role="listview" or anything, and yet it's enhanced as a type-to-reveal filtered listview!

[14:22:24] <johnbender> uGoMobi: alright sigh
[14:22:36] <uGoMobi> race condition
[14:22:40] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hopefully this won't take me too long I have a meeting at 3
[14:22:57] <arschmitz> maybe we should push one more day
[14:23:01] <arschmitz> rather then rush thius?
[14:23:14] <arschmitz> toddmparker: uGoMobi: johnbender: ^^???
[14:23:16] <uGoMobi> johnbender: all other things work great! nice work!
[14:23:46] <johnbender> arschmitz: we can also just do the deploy with the php docs zip
[14:23:57] <uGoMobi> right
[14:23:58] <johnbender> arschmitz: but todd's still in a meeting
[14:24:09] <arschmitz> yeah its getting late though be right back
[14:24:52] <_|Nix|_> Can someone please confirm that the links to the old fixed polyfill at http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/widgets/headers/bars-fixed.php are in a reveal-only filtered listview?
[14:25:42] <_|Nix|_> Why on Earth is that turning into a listview?
[14:26:33] <_|Nix|_> OK ... this is messed up ...
[14:27:14] <johnbender> uGoMobi: do you know of any other files off the top of your head with includes that are included in other files?
[14:27:42] <_|Nix|_> <ul><li><a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a></li><li><a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a></li></ul> turns into a listview with a filter and items initially hidden ?!
[14:29:19] <uGoMobi> johnbender: search.php
[14:29:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: global-nav and search 
[14:29:24] <johnbender> yah that's all I have
[14:29:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: correct
[14:30:40] <uGoMobi> that are the only two files that are included in pages but also have includes in them
[14:30:42] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'm losing my mind ... the links get all messed up, too!
[14:31:02] <_|Nix|_> http://slashdot.org/ turns into http://localhost/nix/jqm/docs/http://slashdot.org/ !

[14:39:18] <arschmitz> ok i need to run to hospital
[14:39:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you are right, I fix it now
[14:39:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what needs to change im commiting a huge change to that file lol

[14:40:28] <uGoMobi> ok great
[14:40:49] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[14:40:53] <arschmitz> i have now extracted everything for search filter enhancments to an extension to listview!
[14:41:14] <arschmitz> the keyword highlight, arrowkey nav and ability to submit form
[14:42:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Very cool!
[14:42:24] <arschmitz> yup
[14:42:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We'll have a few such extensions ready to pounce upon the post-1.3.0 trunk ...
[14:42:41] <arschmitz> yup
[14:43:18] <arschmitz> if we dont deploy tonight im doing a demo of how we do our global nav / search and all the enhancments
[14:43:30] <arschmitz> im sure people will be wondering lol

[14:50:46] <arschmitz> if we dont deploy in next couple hours ill do it when i get home
[14:51:14] <johnbender> arschmitz: I thought I made those navigate bindings "ones"
[14:51:29] <arschmitz> johnbender i think its a scope issue
[14:51:36] <arschmitz> i have not really looked yet dont have time
[14:51:38] <arschmitz> right now
[14:52:08] <johnbender> arschmitz: kk, let me know

[14:52:57] <arschmitz> i need to go to hospital lol
[14:53:05] <johnbender> arschmitz: don't worry about it

[14:56:28] <uGoMobi> all fine now
[14:57:24] <_|Nix|_> docs/widgets/loader/ is all h0rked. It displays jquery.js in view source.
[14:59:53] <uGoMobi> the keywords are not nested in the anchor so if you click at the bottom half of the button nothing happens
[15:02:10] <uGoMobi> I didn't see arschmitz push

[15:08:50] <toddmparker> Out of my meeting 
[15:08:56] <_|Nix|_> Argh! docs/widgets/loader: The Custom HTML loader is not working. The image link is broken - probably the same base tag issue.
[15:10:40] <toddmparker> Missing the / or a bigger issue?
[15:11:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The link I followed was not missing the /
[15:11:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and yet the href is calculated wrong.
[15:11:29] <_|Nix|_> OK. I think I give up for today. If anyone wants to tackle this, go to the front page, then click "Loader overlay", then, on the loader page, click custom HTML.
[15:12:05] <_|Nix|_> There's another problem. If you refresh docs/widgets/loader/, the custom html works, but the layout is bad. The jQM logo is too big for the loader widget.
[15:12:18] <_|Nix|_> ... aaaand I'm gone. L8R all!
[15:12:36] <toddmparker> I can't get any loader to work 
[15:12:52] <toddmparker> Missing the data Ajax false?
[15:14:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah - I had that. And if you click view source, you get jquery.js for the JS portion.
[15:14:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... but then it started working all by itself.
[15:14:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So much for my being gone ...
[15:14:44] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I guess I can still chat, but I don't have enough brain left to make any more changes.

[15:18:49] <toddmparker> hi johnbender 
[15:19:05] <toddmparker> oh, no worries. just curious where you are with the build
[15:19:29] <johnbender> toddmparker: the docs are set but there are some issues floating around according to _|Nix|_ arschmitz and uGoMobi 
[15:19:39] <johnbender> nothing to do with the includes so far as I know
[15:19:46] <toddmparker> cool
[15:20:10] <toddmparker> so the zip is built with the php business all squared up ?
[15:20:39] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah at least to mine and uGoMobi's eyes
[15:20:54] <toddmparker> cool
[15:21:01] <toddmparker> are these up on the CDN?
[15:21:05] <toddmparker> don't see it here - http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.0/jquery.mobile-1.3.0.zip
[15:21:12] <johnbender> toddmparker: no
[15:21:22] <johnbender> I didn't do a build because there were issues
[15:21:32] <johnbender> toddmparker: I can do a deploy if you want
[15:21:38] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I found one small issue
[15:21:44] <toddmparker> that's fine. rather give people a bit more time to fix things up
[15:21:44] <johnbender> toddmparker: ^
[15:22:22] <toddmparker> johnbender: not sure, i always like having it up so i can at least test links in the blob post and such ahead of time
[15:22:31] <uGoMobi> johnbender: nevermind.. I can fix that in the markup
[15:22:39] <johnbender> toddmparker: for that I can just do a quick build that we'll replace
[15:22:44] <toddmparker> so if we can do a test deploy, then replace it, couldn't hurt
[15:22:49] <toddmparker> cool
[15:22:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi: should I merge includes into master?
[15:23:02] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes please
[15:23:12] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: what are the outstanding issues
[15:23:33] <kam187-rMBP> hey guys i have a question about how transitions work programatically
[15:23:34] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the markup of the search results lists
[15:23:42] <uGoMobi> keywords are not nested in the anchor
[15:23:59] <uGoMobi> so clicking the bottom half of the button doesn't do anything
[15:24:00] <kam187-rMBP> background: i have slow transitions between pages - i know all the standard fixes and its basically down to alot of info in the page :)

[15:24:35] <kam187-rMBP> yeah i know
[15:24:35] <johnbender> nothing
[15:24:56] <johnbender> it's up to the compositing engine
[15:25:04] <kam187-rMBP> right now what happens is when i transition from page A to B, there's a big lag, i assume it loads B, enhances it, then transitions from A->B
[15:25:19] <johnbender> correct
[15:25:24] <kam187-rMBP> what i'd like to do instead is transition out A, load and enhance B and then transition it in
[15:25:41] <kam187-rMBP> there'd be a while for the user starring at my background but at least the clicks would feel response
[15:25:43] <kam187-rMBP> *responsive
[15:25:49] <johnbender> kam187-rMBP: you can replace the default transition handler with your own
[15:26:05] <johnbender> but the example transition handlers are hard to understand :(
[15:26:24] <kam187-rMBP> yeah :/
[15:26:34] <johnbender> kam187-rMBP: alternately you could load just the bit that will show on the new page
[15:26:42] <johnbender> and then after the transition load/enhance the rest
[15:26:44] <johnbender> to speed things up
[15:26:56] <kam187-rMBP> hmm smart

[15:33:40] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i noticed that issue on results
[15:34:59] <agcolom> toddmparker: what should I do? tag and go to bed or go to bed? (unless you think we're deploying in the next 20min or so...)
[15:35:15] <toddmparker> kam187-rMBP: a lot of the slowness can be the hardware accel. too. it spends a lot of time rendering out the page before it starts the transition.
[15:35:28] <toddmparker> agcolom: think we should wait until tomorrow
[15:35:39] <toddmparker> go to bed!
[15:35:47] <agcolom> ok :-) 
[15:35:52] <agcolom> goodnight all :-)
[15:36:38] <kam187-rMBP> toddmparker: yeah i think trying to speed it up any more than i have is futile.  I've disabled the 400ms delay thing touch devices have, and been smarter about how and when i enhance elements, but there's just too many complex objects for this poor slow device :P
[15:37:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: other than the search and the loader issue _|Nix|_ mentioned, anything else on fire?
[15:37:34] <toddmparker> kam187-rMBP: yeah, there's no magic. these devices use smoke and mirrors but have slow processors and no memory
[15:38:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no I don't think so
[15:38:10] <toddmparker> i'd lazy load things. have the page just have the stuff at the top, then use ajax to pull in the stuff below and enhance post-transition
[15:38:16] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: oh, not too bad then
[15:38:20] <kam187-rMBP> toddmparker: yeah, i design HW myself!  I'll just use some loading bar or nice fancy background graphic they can stare at
[15:38:29] <toddmparker> yep
[15:38:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: need to go thru the other two nav files to clean up some keywords
[15:38:52] <uGoMobi> but that won't take long
[15:39:14] <uGoMobi> going to fix search list markup first now
[15:40:15] <toddmparker> kam187-rMBP: read this, it's a doozy. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4340#issuecomment-6497298
[15:40:33] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great
[15:40:50] <toddmparker> i can help with the content stuff. did a decent pass thru Q&A already

[15:46:58] <kam187-rMBP> toally
[15:47:00] <toddmparker> seemed relevant
[15:47:18] <toddmparker> it was the transition setup that was slow

[15:49:56] <toddmparker> johnbender: do the event and method navigate demos do anything? they seem broken.
[15:50:20] <johnbender> toddmparker: console.log
[15:50:40] <johnbender> uGoMobi: had the same problem
[15:50:51] <johnbender> which suggests that the console output should be dumped into the page
[15:52:37] <toddmparker> ah, i think so

[16:06:01] <johnbender> toddmparker: I think I have it fixed
[16:06:11] <johnbender> it looks like the docs js file was renamed
[16:06:17] <johnbender> and the build expects it to have a specific name :(
[16:06:19] <johnbender> sigh

[16:06:51] <toddmparker> you are a champ
[16:07:22] <johnbender> toddmparker: it's ok I built most of this crap so it's only fair that I have to deal with it
[16:07:31] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I also changed that filename in jquery.mobile.docs.js
[16:07:45] <uGoMobi> jqm-docs.js --> jqm-demos.js
[16:07:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yap ok that was the issue
[16:08:00] <uGoMobi> sorry
[16:08:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I should put tests in there for those expectations
[16:08:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: no not at all
[16:08:12] <johnbender> you shouldn't have to worry about renaming files lolol
[16:08:19] <toddmparker> whew
[16:08:48] <uGoMobi> johnbender: maybe I was confused because in grunt 0.4 branch it combines files in one jqm-demos.js
[16:15:14] <johnbender> toddmparker: deploying now

[16:25:02] <toddmparker> johnbender: zip looks great but if i click i link, i get a 404
[16:26:56] <toddmparker> take that back, i can nav to the first few links but nothing inside 
[16:27:02] <toddmparker> i see the issue
[16:27:12] <toddmparker> links should be: 
[16:27:14] <toddmparker> demos/docs/widgets/accordions/index.html
[16:27:28] <toddmparker> but are demos/widgets/accordions/index.html

[18:53:50] <toddmparker___> open index.html in /demos/ - looks good
[18:53:52] <uGoMobi> I just realized that moving favicon to root isn't smart idea... it won't end up in the build
[18:54:31] <toddmparker___> the first few links on top are ok, but the widget links below or any of the Q&A and demos are a 404

[19:00:42] <toddmparker___> ok
[19:00:52] <toddmparker___> so maybe it's fixed
[19:01:30] <uGoMobi> no

[19:11:34] <toddmparker___> so we need more more build cleanup
[19:12:07] <toddmparker___> oh, crap. you mean 1.9.1?
[19:12:25] <toddmparker___> are we not using 1.9.1 in master?

[19:12:59] <uGoMobi> going to test local now
[19:13:05] <toddmparker___> gah
[19:13:06] <toddmparker___> me too
[19:14:48] <toddmparker___> i swapped it out locally and the panels in the demos work

[19:14:55] <toddmparker___> not seeing transitions tho
[19:15:00] <uGoMobi> I did the same
[19:15:15] <toddmparker___> hmm
[19:15:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I don't see transitions but that's because I am on Chrome/Linux

[19:36:48] <toddmparker___> ?tell _|Nix|_ - there seems to be a bug with the popup. click the API link on the homepage to open the popup then refresh and you see an infinite spinner. If there is a #&ui-state=dialog in the URL, navigation fails.
[19:36:59] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: yeah
[19:37:10] <uGoMobi> would rel = external help?
[19:37:20] <uGoMobi> just a wild guess
[19:37:22] <toddmparker___> hope thats a docs thing and not popup being broken
[19:37:31] <uGoMobi> or is that already on the link... didn't check
[19:37:36] <toddmparker___> it should handle that url pattern gracefully
[19:37:48] <uGoMobi> yeah I thought so
[19:38:02] <toddmparker___> we prevent deep linking to a popup, but it should fix itself and show the page
[19:39:48] <uGoMobi> ok I go to bed
[19:39:54] <toddmparker___> slideup looks cool on a phone
[19:39:58] <toddmparker___> goodnight
[19:40:05] <toddmparker___> thanks for all your help
[19:40:21] <uGoMobi> thanks
[19:41:04] <uGoMobi> good night all
