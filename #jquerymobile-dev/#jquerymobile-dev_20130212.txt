[02:43:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[02:43:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah - debugging nav in IE7 in browserstack is impossible.
[02:44:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey! yeah it is
[02:44:28] <_|Nix|_> So, when are we finally dropping support for that whole painful era of the Web?
[02:44:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, I'm trying to do 45 degree rotations using the IE filters - not pretty.
[02:45:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe something we should discuss for 1.4
[02:45:41] <_|Nix|_> Definitely. It would save us all a lot of pain.
[02:45:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: have to see how much pain IE7 is causing us
[02:46:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we are planning on improving C-grade styling in 1.4
[02:47:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe people won't even notice if degrade IE7 ;-)
[02:52:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I for one won't mind ripping out all the crap we added for IE.
[02:53:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is that crap mostly for IE7 or also for IE8?
[02:55:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I wouldn't mind degrading IE7 but since people with WinXP can only use IE8 (or less) I would prefer if we could keep supporting that for a while
[02:57:11] <_|Nix|_> I'd prefer if we got together all our wits and wrote a virus that caused all computers running IE to melt down, but not before displaying a message box that says something really nasty.
[02:57:26] <uGoMobi> lol
[02:57:56] <uGoMobi> and auto burn WP7.x devices? ;-) 
[02:58:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Absolutely. Let them die.
[02:58:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Punish! M$ for all the global warming they caused.

[03:33:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is there a way to detect IE < 9 ?
[03:34:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I actually got the arrows to work on IE8, but I don't want to mess up WP7.5 ...
[03:34:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I remember arschmitz telling me that $.mobile.browser.oldIE also clobbers WP7.5 ...
[03:34:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think $.mobile.oldIE returns true for less than IE9
[03:35:06] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[03:35:22] <uGoMobi> you can detect it with UA sniffing
[03:35:36] <_|Nix|_> Well, whatever. Let the WP users suffer because of oldIE ... *shrug* ...
[03:36:01] <uGoMobi> WP7 has mobileIE in the string I think
[03:36:24] <_|Nix|_> I'll try to clean up the CSS and call it a day.
[03:37:24] <_|Nix|_> Although I'm not sure if what I have works with both IE8 and IE7 ... anyway ... I'm gonna go buy some groceries now :/
[03:38:36] <uGoMobi> good decision :)
[04:13:44] <_|Nix|_> ... aaaand I'm back in IE hell ..
[04:15:25] <_|Nix|_> Wow! IE7 is actually decent, except for the clipping ...
[04:18:47] <_|Nix|_> Man ... what's wrong with this (in IE7)? clip: rect(-1000px 2000px 10px -1000px);
[04:19:24] <_|Nix|_> I've already removed the commas ...
[04:19:36] <_|Nix|_> the same thing works in IE8 ...
[04:22:14] <_|Nix|_> Once more I am inclined to use expletives when referring to anything coming out of that hole in Redmond.
[05:02:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do we still support BB5? I ask because according to caniuse.com it doesn't support :not()
[05:02:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, but the grade depends on which core version is used
[05:03:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but then if it gets anything greater than C, all our :not() stuff will not work.
[05:04:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: same with IE7
[05:04:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's fine.
[05:04:18] <uGoMobi> :)
[05:04:43] <uGoMobi> I know, that's why I tried to avoid using :not() selector
[05:04:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I actually have to add something to non-IE7 that must be absent in IE7 so I need to use a :not(), which it'll ignore anyway.
[05:05:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, since we're using it, I'll use it too ... I can't think of another way ...
[05:05:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The arrow's background must be set to none, but not on IE7 ...
[05:05:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: here is another way to do that https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.forms.rangeslider.css#L59
[05:06:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't get it ... that empty comment causes ... what?
[05:07:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: although, that targets old IE
[05:07:47] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, I'll use the :not() for now - we can fix it later ... I just wanna get to a state where any further fix is an improvement.
[05:08:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sorry, I was wrong, it does exclude old IE... because of the comment in the selector

[05:46:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If I use clip: rect() then for IE I must not use commas between the arguments, but for every other browser I should use commas even though it understands space-based separators. Is it then OK to just use spaces for the clip?
[05:49:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I would use both
[05:49:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there might be browsers that don't except it without commas
[05:49:55] <uGoMobi> or drop support for it in the near future
[05:49:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK - No chance to same some bytes on that account, eh?
[05:50:07] <_|Nix|_> s/same/save/
[05:51:02] <uGoMobi> I wouldn't rely on it
[05:53:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why don't you just not support IE7?
[05:53:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you have to add lot of extra lines to make it work
[05:54:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can just add one rule that hides the whole div that contains the pointer on IE7
[05:55:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: IE7 doesn't have rounded corners, no background gradient, no... lot of other things... but it will have a very cool pointy popup?! ;-)
[05:55:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Whatever ... I got it to work relatively decently.

[06:40:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Should be good now ^
[06:41:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I couldn't find a better way to separate IE9 out of older IE than to check for the ui-mobile-nosupport-boxshadow class ...
[06:42:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looks good now!
[06:43:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah - IE9 uses the real code, not the IE crap.
[06:43:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There are still off-by-one errors here and there, resulting in a separation between the arrow and the popup. It can be seen on WP7.5 sometimes.
[06:44:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess some off-by-one erros cannot be avoided when you're dealing with coordinates that are multiples of sqrt(2)/2.
[06:45:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and the whole shebang doesn't really work too well with thick borders.
[06:45:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not border-width agnostic. I'd need box-sizing: border-box to make that work, but, unfortunately then I'd have to find an alternative for IE8- ...
[06:45:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looks like it doesn't work on IE8
[06:46:06] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ....
[06:46:15] <uGoMobi> but I didn't test on actual IE8 browser
[06:46:26] <uGoMobi> just a testing program 
[06:46:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm testing on browserstack ...
[06:46:43] <_|Nix|_> But wait - I have IE8 on my Windoze laptop ...
[06:46:55] <uGoMobi> if it looks ok there it should be fine
[06:46:58] <_|Nix|_> Looks good on browserstack ...
[06:47:26] <uGoMobi> I used crappy IEtester
[06:48:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It works on IE8 but it has an off-by-one error.
[06:49:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The arrow seems shifted over by (1px, 1px). So, the top and left arrows are clipped too much, whereas the bottom and right arrows are clipped too little, so you can see the two corners at the base of the arrow.
[06:50:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok... if that's only on old IE/WP, can't you shift the pointer 1px on those browsers?
[06:50:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Works fine on IE8/XP, but it's OB1 on IE8/W7
[06:51:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see
[06:52:09] <_|Nix|_> OK, weird ... looks OK on IE8/WP7 in browserstack ...
[06:52:52] <_|Nix|_> I think I'm about to throw up my hands and say "fsck it" ... I've done more than enough for IE.
[07:15:26] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: fine with me. you can set the bar wherever you want with i.e. support on that. as long as it degrades gracefully, the arrow isn't critial.

[09:33:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I see other problems. Like, when you start going back, the first back succeeds as expected, but on subsequent back occasions you have to click back multiple times before you achieve the effect.

[09:33:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: only ie7?

[09:39:20] <johnbender> I think I have a VM with 7 installed
[09:39:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Excellent - it's pretty much impossible to debug on browserstack.
[09:40:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you can use a tunnel
[09:40:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: but that requires javascript
[09:40:43] <_|Nix|_> It's not that - it's the lack of dev tools. Loading the page is no problem. I have a domain.

[09:41:04] <johnbender> that's not entirely true
[09:41:17] <johnbender> you can setup script debugging in IE7 but if I recall correctly it's sort of a nightmare
[09:41:33] <_|Nix|_> Yep. Wasted an hour on that.
[09:42:08] <_|Nix|_> ... and then I restarted my browserstack session, and the VM I ended up in didn't have the script debugging installed ...

[11:20:28] <johnbender> ajpiano: should I just attend the hangout?
[11:20:29] <ajpiano> so crazy right now
[11:20:49] <ajpiano> johnbender: if you'd likle
[11:20:49] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[11:20:50] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1245: FIXED in 12 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1245/
[11:20:59] <johnbender> ajpiano: lol
[11:20:59] <ajpiano> it's more tuned toward folks who don't have much/any speaking exp
[11:21:24] <johnbender> ajpiano: I'm going to submit I'm just trying to decide if I should do something down to earth
[11:21:32] <johnbender> (leaning toward that for various reasons)
[12:02:44] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Do each of us have to submit a presentation_
[12:02:50] <_|Nix|_> ?
[12:02:54] <ajpiano> ?
[12:03:03] <ajpiano> no one's required to submit anything
[12:03:36] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Oh, OK ... is it optional then? I'm just asking because I'm reading what johnbender was asking?
[12:03:56] <ajpiano> is what optional, the q&a?
[12:04:09] <ajpiano> yes, of course it is
[12:04:34] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: OK. I'm starting to get the picture. Thanks!
[12:04:49] <ajpiano> ok, yeah, it's just to help folks out, it's not like a "required orientation"
[12:05:28] <johnbender> sorry
[12:05:34] <johnbender> I'm confusing things
[12:05:44] <ajpiano> i don't think you did
[12:05:46] <ajpiano> :p
[12:07:43] <_|Nix|_> OK, so I guess we're on rails for 1.3.0 then ...
[12:09:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It seems https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5512 just refuses to die ...
[12:13:54] <gseguin> johnbender: thank you for the kind words
[12:14:44] <gseguin> johnbender: same feeling here, I'm lucky to work with such bright people
[12:14:52] <johnbender> gseguin: yessir
[12:20:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: http://jsbin.com/onibuc/223 - I'm still seeing the same issue and before, and so is the reporter of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5512 ...
[12:21:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It requires multiple clicks of the back button to retreat in the history. Usually, the first back sets the hash to /path/to/landingPage but doesn't change the page at all, while a subsequent click will correctly set the URL to the previous page and change the page as well.
[12:30:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm works for me :(
[12:30:51] <johnbender> cache?
[12:30:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: let me double check
[12:33:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I doubt it's cache ... I started a new instance of browserstack.
[12:33:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah
[12:34:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It was IE7 on XP.
[12:34:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: going to page 2 goes back just fine
[12:34:16] <johnbender> there's some odity with how it behaves from page 3 
[12:34:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Try to make your way all the way back to the starting page.
[12:34:51] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I did
[12:34:53] <johnbender> works fine
[12:34:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That is, 1. page1 -> page2 -> page3 -> page1 -> page2, and 2. Go all the way back to the beginning of history.
[12:35:03] <johnbender> ahh
[12:35:04] <johnbender> yah
[12:35:10] <johnbender> going through all the steps is funny
[12:35:15] <johnbender> needs moar work
[12:35:22] <_|Nix|_> Indeed ...
[12:35:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: alright at least the hashchange is firing now
[12:35:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah.
[12:40:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: part of me wonders if we shouldn't just opt ie7 out of nav lolol
[12:40:09] * johnbender is lazy
[12:40:25] <johnbender> I suppose I should at least try
[12:40:27] <johnbender> :)
[12:40:57] <_|Nix|_> I agree wholeheartedly.
[12:41:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We should just opt IE7 out of existence altogether.
[12:41:21] <johnbender> :)
[13:12:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well
[13:12:51] <johnbender> this is ...
[13:12:53] <johnbender> interesting
[13:13:05] <johnbender> there are times when I hit the back button that the hash doesn't change at all
[13:13:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yep. I noticed that too.
[13:13:47] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: checking if that's our fault or just ie7
[13:13:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I put some console.log statements into all the hashchange handlers and nothing.
[13:14:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah I'm wondering if we're setting the hash to the same thing twice or something
[13:14:31] <johnbender> and ie7 is creating an entry
[13:14:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, as you go back, the location keeps chaning.
[13:15:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It seems to intersperse all previously encountered locations.
[13:15:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: not for me it doesn't
[13:15:18] <johnbender> there's a place where I hit back
[13:15:22] <johnbender> and the hash is the same
[13:15:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hmmm ...
[13:17:21] <johnbender> yah I can hit the back button but literally nothing happens
[13:31:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/5512.avi
[13:31:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Really weird. Sometimes the forward history just disappears.
[13:40:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: FWIW, 1.2.0 behaves the same way.
[13:41:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: :/
[13:41:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: lolololol
[13:41:15] <johnbender> fuck this
[13:41:21] <johnbender> toddmparker___: you around
[13:41:22] <johnbender> ?
[13:41:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't see any advantage in opting ie7 into nav
[13:41:59] <_|Nix|_> Nope.
[13:42:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Get thee to a class-b-ery.
[13:42:32] <johnbender> seriously
[13:43:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: actually, I remember having issues with ie7 and the back button
[13:49:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm going to keep poking around a bit but when I talk with Todd I'll suggest opting ie7 out of ajax nav
[13:50:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: For sure. The only other thing I can think of is jquery.hashchange.js - that's always been a black box to me, but it may well not handler IE7 sufficiently.
[13:51:21] <_|Nix|_> s/handler/handle/
[13:52:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes, that's where I"m debugging
[13:52:35] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think there's something going on with the hashchange
[13:52:52] <johnbender> err
[13:52:55] <johnbender> the hash values
[13:53:00] <johnbender> I'll let you know when I find something
[13:53:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: jquery.hashchange.js has a big, fat, clearly marked section for IE6/7/8 ... I guess it took some doing to make those work.
[13:54:10] <johnbender> yah I'm monkeying around in there to see what's gonig on
[13:54:16] <johnbender> I don't think it's that
[13:54:18] <johnbender> but we'll see
[13:54:29] <johnbender> that is
[13:54:35] <johnbender> It might still be us
[13:55:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, if you find a place where you can stick an alert that actually pops whenever you hit the back button let me know :)
[13:56:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: lolol
[13:56:24] <johnbender> haven't yet
[13:57:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Another possibility is to create a page that has just jQuery and jquery.hashchange.js and nothing else. That should quickly eliminate any mistakes on our part.
[13:58:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think it's something to do with us
[13:58:05] <johnbender> just trying to figure out what though

[16:06:46] <toddmparker> Busy day, sorry i was mia
[16:07:28] <toddmparker> What needs to be dove on the docs? Should I do a proofread pass tonight 
[16:07:54] <toddmparker> Is RWhitbeck around 
[16:08:09] <toddmparker> Curious about the site stuff
[16:11:45] <johnbender> toddmparker: we might need to opt ie7 out of navi
[16:11:47] <johnbender> *nav
[16:11:55] <johnbender> toddmparker: looking into it though
[16:12:23] <toddmparker> Thought we already did
[16:14:30] <toddmparker> Guess that was 6
[16:14:32] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/
[16:14:47] <toddmparker> We can kick ie7 out of nav IMHO 
[16:17:09] <toddmparker> Looks like we still need to auto close panel behavior for the h2 widget - arschmitz or uGoMobi 
[16:17:18] <toddmparker> Looks nice tho 
[16:17:48] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes we need to add that and active state needs to be removed
[16:17:57] <toddmparker> Right
[16:18:18] <toddmparker> Hey ugomobi
[16:18:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: there is another issue with the h2widget that we need to fix first
[16:18:34] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[16:18:36] <toddmparker> Dies scrolling glitchy in the panels
[16:18:53] <toddmparker> Seems to not scroll smoothly
[16:19:15] <toddmparker> iOS6
[16:19:27] <uGoMobi> what page do you test?
[16:20:10] <toddmparker> Open the global nav here
[16:20:13] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/navbar/
[16:20:26] <toddmparker> First scroll will stop after a few px
[16:21:25] <uGoMobi> hmm don't see it on iPad
[16:23:18] <uGoMobi> ah ok I see it now
[16:24:50] <uGoMobi> look like it has to do with the panel top margin and the changes that were needed for that
[16:25:05] <uGoMobi> bottom 0 instead of height 100%
[16:33:48] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: you there? Got a quick question about your release script
[16:34:09] <DaveMethvin> gseguin sure
[16:34:39] <gseguin> Any reason why it's not a grunt task?
[16:34:49] <DaveMethvin> um, i'm lazy? :D
[16:34:54] <gseguin> heh :D
[16:35:00] <DaveMethvin> i was waiting for grunt to stablizie
[16:35:02] <DaveMethvin> stabliize
[16:35:07] <DaveMethvin> whatev
[16:35:10] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I see
[16:35:49] <toddmparker> Might be good to not mess with margins then?
[16:35:53] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: ok, I'm going to attempt making it a grunt 0.4 task and make it so we can share it 
[16:36:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: will test if that is indeed the cause
[16:36:23] <toddmparker> No sharing with those guys
[16:36:25] <DaveMethvin> sweet! 
[16:36:36] <DaveMethvin> thanks, i knew procrastination would pay off gseguin
[16:36:39] <toddmparker> Hey gseguin and DaveMethvin 
[16:36:45] <gseguin> :)
[16:36:46] <toddmparker> Score!
[16:36:50] <DaveMethvin> hey toddmparker
[16:37:15] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Wasn't sure if that could been the swipe binding
[16:39:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that could also be the cause
[16:49:10] <toddmparker> Almost home, will be back on in a bit
[18:00:16] <toddmparker___> and back
[18:24:38] <toddmparker___> working on the 1.3 blog post
[18:24:47] <toddmparker___> deprecating nested lists
[18:24:52] <toddmparker___> listing ie7 as b grade
[18:24:55] <toddmparker___> what else
[18:38:59] <toddmparker___> this is gonna be the longest blog post ever
[20:05:52] <RWhitbeck> toddmparker___ when is 1.3 going out?
