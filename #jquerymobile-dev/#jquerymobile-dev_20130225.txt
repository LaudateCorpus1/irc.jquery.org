[07:00:37] <gseguin> hey arschmitz 
[07:00:48] <gseguin> where you at jQCon.EU ?
[07:00:59] <arschmitz> sadly no
[07:01:17] <arschmitz> was way too close to the due date lol
[07:01:31] <gseguin> yeah that's what I thought
[07:01:41] <arschmitz> same thing with toranto
[07:02:17] <gseguin> when is Toronto?
[07:02:38] <arschmitz> march 1-3
[07:03:03] <gseguin> oh ok
[07:03:10] <arschmitz> so this weekend lol
[07:03:51] <arschmitz> will be in portlant for sure though
[07:03:54] <arschmitz> portland
[07:04:01] <gseguin> same here
[07:04:05] <arschmitz> nice
[07:05:25] <arschmitz> funny i live in portland yet will have to fly 3200 miles to get there
[07:05:36] <gseguin> heh :)
[07:06:42] <arschmitz> your in colorado right?
[07:15:21] <uGoMobi> morning guys
[07:15:42] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi:
[07:16:08] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz : how are you?
[07:16:21] <arschmitz> Im good thank you 
[07:16:24] <arschmitz> how are you?
[07:16:33] <uGoMobi> all fine here, thanks
[07:17:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how were the first days your son was at home
[07:17:34] <uGoMobi> ?
[07:17:55] <arschmitz> great pretty much just took the time to spend with him and my wife
[07:18:09] <uGoMobi> of course
[07:18:11] <uGoMobi> nice!
[07:18:21] <uGoMobi> did you sleep well? ;-)
[07:18:37] <arschmitz> yeah wife and i have a deal that works out lol
[07:18:47] <uGoMobi> great
[07:19:49] <arschmitz> i generally sleep from like midning 1ish untill like 5 or 6 but she goes to bed a lot earlier so i take care of him untill i go to bed so she can sleep and she gets to take care of him while im sleeping
[07:20:16] <uGoMobi> sounds like a good deal :)
[07:20:30] <arschmitz> yup lets us both get some good uninterupted sleep lol
[07:23:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so was playing around on the demos site with a surface pro this weekend
[07:23:09] <arschmitz> lots of bugs
[07:23:17] <uGoMobi> hmm
[07:23:34] <uGoMobi> MS Surface specific bugs?
[07:23:56] <arschmitz> not sure
[07:24:06] <arschmitz> im guessing ie10 since it was a surface pro
[07:24:53] <arschmitz> going to see if i can reproduce them in chrome 
[07:25:05] <uGoMobi> I will update my Wndows to 8 soon
[07:25:26] <uGoMobi> hope IE10 on Win8 has better debug tool
[07:25:35] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:25:44] <arschmitz> biggest breaking problem i noticed
[07:25:54] <arschmitz> is if you go to transitions page
[07:26:10] <arschmitz> pick a transition it works fine 
[07:26:18] <arschmitz> then go back to transitions page
[07:26:24] <arschmitz> evertything is still fine
[07:26:44] <arschmitz> pick any transition besides none and it locks the whole page up 100% non responsive
[07:26:53] <uGoMobi> pff
[07:26:58] <RWhitbeck> Good Morning peeps!
[07:27:06] <arschmitz> Morning RWhitbeck
[07:27:12] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: morning Ralph!
[07:27:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats a pretty bad one though going to need to see if it happens in a jsbin 
[07:28:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that sounds like a blocker indeed
[07:29:36] <arschmitz> one other potential blocker i noticed was if you call $.mobile.navigate going to a hash like lets say your at www.foo.com/options/defaults/
[07:29:49] <arschmitz> and call navigate to #bar
[07:29:57] <arschmitz> you will get www.foo.com/#bar
[07:30:38] <arschmitz> and it breaks navigation
[07:31:20] <uGoMobi> geez
[07:31:26] <arschmitz> yup
[07:31:28] <uGoMobi> sounds familiar though
[07:31:45] <arschmitz> yeah its something with replace state
[07:32:09] <arschmitz> not sure if its a broken implementation in ie or if its on our side yet
[07:32:26] <arschmitz> could be related to something with basetag also
[07:33:05] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:33:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: abunch of layout visual stuff too
[07:33:42] <arschmitz> the search input gets a clear x native plus the one we add side by side
[07:34:11] <arschmitz> the shadow from the autocomplete for the search stays after you close it
[07:35:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: quite a list for playing with it for only 10 or 15 minutes :(
[07:35:22] <uGoMobi> there more issues with elements don't losing their focus state... like the select on Android/Chrome but also issues on FF and Opera
[07:36:44] <arschmitz> on the plus side bugs seem consistant between desktop and metro
[07:37:09] <uGoMobi> well that's something :)
[07:37:33] <arschmitz> ok so double clear buttons shows on browserstack
[07:37:44] <arschmitz> but the stuck shadow does now
[07:37:50] <arschmitz> not*
[07:38:41] <arschmitz> transition issue does not show on browserstack :(
[07:39:13] <uGoMobi> I noticed a box-shadow issue with checkboxes on IE9 the other day... was highly customized style though so I am not sure yet if it's a framework issue
[07:39:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when I tested transitions on IE10 / Win8 consumer preview I didn't see an issue either
[07:40:03] <arschmitz> yea this might be surface specific
[07:40:19] <arschmitz> ill have to get toddmparker: to try on his surface RT
[07:40:42] <uGoMobi> the other thing we have to keep in mind is that all pages in /docs/ contain panels
[07:40:43] <RWhitbeck> hey guys where is the new demo site in github?
[07:40:54] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: /docs/
[07:40:55] <arschmitz> its part of the main repo
[07:41:26] <RWhitbeck> thanks I kept looking for a demo folder. 
[07:41:52] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: renaming that folder turned out to be not that simple as you would expect :)
[07:41:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so the hash issue with navigate does not happen either
[07:42:20] <RWhitbeck> no worries.  
[07:43:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i guess surface is super buggy!
[07:44:15] <arschmitz> of the 4 big things i noticed 3 do not happen on browserstack
[07:44:42] <arschmitz> which is really dumb since it was a surface pro so it should be exactly the same
[07:58:42] <toddmparker> good morning!
[07:58:48] <toddmparker> man, nice to be back in the office
[07:58:52] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker
[07:58:58] <gseguin> hey toddmparker 
[07:58:58] <arschmitz> yeah how was vienna?
[07:59:33] <toddmparker> hey arschmitz and gseguin 
[07:59:36] <toddmparker> what did i miss?
[07:59:48] <gseguin> not much
[07:59:49] <arschmitz> surface pro bugs!
[07:59:50] <toddmparker> internet was terrible so i really fell out of the loop in vienna
[07:59:54] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[07:59:57] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi 
[08:00:00] <gseguin> the channel was extremely quiet the last few days
[08:00:04] <toddmparker> surface proâ€¦bah
[08:00:10] <toddmparker> GET TO WORK
[08:00:13] <arschmitz> yeah i wasent really around at all either toddmparker
[08:00:19] <toddmparker> think we all needed a break
[08:00:31] <toddmparker> how's the wee guy arschmitz 
[08:00:38] <arschmitz> hes great!
[08:01:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker: might need you to bust out the surface rt to see if some problems happen there or if its only surface pro
[08:02:16] <arschmitz> found 2 major probably blocker issues on surface pro when playing with one this weekend

[08:16:01] <RWhitbeck> arschmitz did you and your wife just have a baby recently?
[08:16:24] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: yes a little over 2 weeks ago
[08:16:38] <RWhitbeck> oh wow â€¦ congrats..  How are the sleepless nights?
[08:16:43] <RWhitbeck> this your first?
[08:16:48] <arschmitz> yes first
[08:17:07] <arschmitz> he has only been home since wednesday because he was in ICU he was 5 weeks premature
[08:17:24] <RWhitbeck> yukâ€¦but he's doing well now?
[08:17:32] <arschmitz> yeah hes great
[08:17:54] <arschmitz> there were never any real problems it was really all precautionary because he was so early
[08:18:02] <RWhitbeck> ah cool
[08:18:08] <arschmitz> yup :)
[08:19:05] <RWhitbeck> hey toddmparker how was vienna?  I heard agcolom knocked her talk out of the parkâ€¦can you confirm these rumors?
[08:21:56] <agcolom> hey all! I can see perfect timing :-)
[08:23:07] <agcolom> The pictures from the press agency: http://www.apa-fotoservice.at/galerie/3891
[08:23:40] <agcolom> (^ the friday pictures, and here are the saturday pictures: http://www.apa-fotoservice.at/galerie/3894
[08:23:55] <Wilto> Hey agcolom!
[08:23:57] <agcolom> Todd and I gave our talk on saturday
[08:24:13] <Wilto> Thanks for the souvenir!
[08:24:16] <agcolom> Hey Wilto! How's the motorbike?
[08:24:23] <agcolom> Wilto: you're very welcome :-) 
[08:28:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hey Anne, how did your talk go?
[08:29:39] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I think it was ok... I was nervous until I left the stage! The audience was very attentive and very serious... 
[08:30:06] <Wilto> agcolom: It is gettinâ€™ dropped off tomorrow, weather permitting.
[08:30:17] <agcolom> Exciting!
[08:31:11] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I hope it didn't show too much that I was nervous... and I did hesitate for words a couple of times... but I think it was ok :-) 
[08:31:13] <Wilto> oh yes it is http://hutchinsoncycle.com/bikes/bikes-sold/1978-triumph-bonneville-750/
[08:31:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: cool :)
[08:33:12] <arschmitz> Wilto: that is a VERY awesome bike!
[08:33:18] <Wilto> Why thank you.
[08:33:36] <Wilto> Pristine condition, too. Starts up on the first kick.
[08:33:37] <arschmitz> love Triumph
[08:33:48] <arschmitz> yeah it looks like its in great shape
[08:33:48] <uGoMobi> oh yeah it sure is an awesome bike
[08:34:04] <Wilto> Riiiight up until I take it apart and ruin it forever.
[08:34:04] <arschmitz> the pain even looks good still
[08:34:19] <Wilto> Yeah; couple small chips on the tank and some pitting in the chrome.
[08:34:26] <Wilto> But I mean, 1978. So.
[08:34:34] <arschmitz> exactly
[08:43:00] <toddmparker> sorry I dropped off there
[08:43:06] <toddmparker> agcolom: kicked butt, yes
[09:27:40] <toddmparker> so this crashing list view bug, no pretty
[09:36:04] <arschmitz> nope
[09:42:36] <toddmparker> sounds like we should queue up 1.3.1
[09:56:54] <arschmitz> yeah there are a few bigger problems from what iv seen but havent been paying as much attention as normal
[09:57:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: would have a better idea i think

[10:00:04] <arschmitz> toddmparker: noticed we missed a whole section in widgets for demos there is nothing on custom select!
[10:02:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm you are right... the custom select page is in the docs/widgets/select/ folder but we didn't apply new format to that page and didn't link it up
[10:03:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I will comment on that nested listview issue with a JS Bin how you can prevent the problem for now
[10:03:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: when i was testing on surface i wanted to test custom selects because of the problems we had been having and there was no page
[10:03:57] <uGoMobi> it's an event bubbling issue
[10:06:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: might want to also comment that nested listviews are officially depreciated 
[10:06:58] <arschmitz> and will be removed completely in 1.4
[10:07:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: well it's not about the nested listview feature
[10:07:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it's a listview that is nested in an UL that doesn't have data-role="listview"
[10:07:48] <arschmitz> oh ok
[10:08:42] <arschmitz> does not really apply then lol

[10:43:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: look at this http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/docs/widgets/pages/
[10:43:43] <uGoMobi> check the base tag in the head...
[10:43:57] <uGoMobi> <base href="http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/docs/widgets/dialog/dialog-alt.html">
[10:44:09] <uGoMobi> :/
[10:44:49] <uGoMobi> that obviously breaks links https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5694
[10:45:51] <uGoMobi> found the cause: <a href="../dialog/dialog-alt.html" data-prefetch="true" data-rel="dialog">This link will prefetch the page</a>
[10:46:14] <uGoMobi> seems like prefetching affects base tag of current page
[10:50:54] <uGoMobi> ok, there is already a ticket for this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5677

[11:09:39] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi 
[11:09:55] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[11:11:01] <toddmparker> if a listview is nested in an UL or OL without data-role="listview"
[11:11:15] <toddmparker> ^^ so that is the only situation where this error happens?
[11:11:35] <toddmparker> if a list view is inside a non-listview UL or OL?
[11:11:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes, only situation I can think of
[11:11:45] <uGoMobi> yes correct
[11:12:02] <toddmparker> that seems like an unlikely markup pattern.
[11:12:05] <toddmparker> nested lists?
[11:12:33] <uGoMobi> yeah, that's why we never noticed
[11:12:36] <toddmparker> just trying to figure out a scenario where you'd do that
[11:12:45] <toddmparker> ah, ok. super edgecase
[11:12:46] <toddmparker> whew
[11:13:09] <uGoMobi> yes and I posted a JS Bin with workaround
[11:13:43] <uGoMobi> and committed fix for 1.3.1
[11:13:56] <toddmparker> great, thanks
[11:14:21] <uGoMobi> so not really something to worry about
[11:20:03] <toddmparker> so any big issues post-1.3.0?
[11:20:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no, not really
[11:21:14] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I wonder what caused this regression https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5679 (transitions on Nexus 7)

[11:33:04] <uGoMobi> he now opened  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5679
[11:33:16] <uGoMobi> because the issue is back
[11:35:01] <toddmparker> right, he was suggesting that it was the older regression but i doubt it
[11:35:11] <toddmparker> think that was the issue above
[11:36:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: can you confirm they look bad?  http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/docs/widgets/transitions/
[11:38:29] <toddmparker> yeah, they are slow
[11:38:39] <toddmparker> wait, i just found -webkit-animation-fill-mode: both;
[11:38:41] <toddmparker> in our css
[11:38:43] <toddmparker> what the...
[11:38:58] <toddmparker> we reverted but that somehow made it in!
[11:39:01] <toddmparker> grr
[11:42:37] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: mind doing some git blame action on that?
[11:42:40] <toddmparker> brb
[11:42:56] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: was already doing that :)
[11:46:06] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: looks like I am the one to blame :(
[11:46:07] <uGoMobi> sorry
[11:46:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hi
[11:46:51] <uGoMobi> when adding the unprefixed properties for IE10 transitions those old lines came back in

[11:48:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: whats up with that base tag??? 
[11:48:56] <arschmitz> where is it possibly getting that from?
[11:48:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: prefetching messes it up
[11:49:02] <arschmitz> ohhhh
[11:49:10] <arschmitz> crazy
[11:49:14] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:49:29] <arschmitz> should be easy to track down though
[11:50:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe johnbender already fixed it in basetag branch, I dunno
[11:50:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: side note though http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/docs/widgets/dialog/dialog-alt.html is nothing but broken links in the head
[11:51:23] <arschmitz> the base tag branck is just an option to keep base tag static so probably not
[11:51:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi: ^
[11:51:32] <johnbender> correct
[11:51:46] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi: but I would work there if you're going to monkey with the basetag stuff
[11:51:53] <johnbender> I'm going to merge that hopefully next week
[11:52:02] <arschmitz> i dont think its the base tag it self
[11:52:19] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah I don't think so either
[11:52:20] <arschmitz> i think its in the navigation the base tag is being update on prefetch
[11:52:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think I fixed that dialog example already in latest
[11:55:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: does not look like it... http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/widgets/dialog/dialog-alt.html
[11:55:34] <arschmitz> has nothing to do with this issue but we should fix lol
[11:56:19] <uGoMobi> yes, will take care of it
[11:56:35] <arschmitz> im looking at base issue right now
[11:58:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this base tag issue is not new
[11:59:00] <arschmitz> it was in 1.2 also
[11:59:33] <arschmitz> and 1.2
[11:59:39] <arschmitz> 1.1 i mean
[11:59:52] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah your description sounded familiar
[12:00:15] <arschmitz> this i already found the issue though
[12:02:26] <arschmitz> this is the reason the old persistant footer page would get so wonky sometimes
[12:04:16] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I just tested and removing those css properties made things quite a bit better
[12:04:41] <toddmparker> i'll push that
[12:04:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok
[12:05:04] <uGoMobi> I was writing comment
[12:05:06] <uGoMobi> .in, .out {
[12:05:06] <uGoMobi>     -webkit-animation-fill-mode: none !important;
[12:05:06] <uGoMobi> }
[12:05:22] <uGoMobi> should work as temporary fix until 1.3.1

[12:07:42] <toddmparker> I commented on that issue
[12:07:57] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: mind picking that into 1.3-stable for me?
[12:08:05] <uGoMobi> pff I really feel stupid... worked on first Opera and then IE10 transitions on my forked repo and copied months later... never a good idea
[12:08:14] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: thanks for fixing
[12:08:16] <toddmparker> right, happens tho
[12:08:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes, I will cherry pick
[12:08:27] <toddmparker> surprised I didn't noticed this during testing
[12:08:36] <toddmparker> i tested a ton on the nexus 7
[12:08:52] <toddmparker> not obvious on fade

[13:27:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do unit tests work for you locally?
[13:28:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you mean on phantomjs or in browser?
[13:28:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: phantomjs
[13:28:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let me check
[13:28:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They started timing out for me again as of a few weeks ago :/
[13:32:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I remember I had that too some time ago when we were testing the PR from Changsuk
[13:32:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's still running now
[13:33:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so it's working for you, eh? Funny you should mention that - I'm trying to apply the rest of his PR (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5466).
[13:34:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, for me it seems unrelated to the changes from the PR, because phantomjs times out even on master.
[13:35:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah johnbender and i looked at those a bit
[13:35:18] <arschmitz> the are unrelated to the library
[13:35:31] <arschmitz> not sure whats going on with them
[13:35:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, not related... it was the other PR BTW $(document) and $(window)
[13:35:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK ... 
[13:36:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I think I'm going to push those changes ... it's too bad things are broken even on jenkins ...
[13:36:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can pull after you pushed and run the tests
[13:36:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That'd be good ...
[13:37:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i checked all the commits around when it happened and nothing but demos stuff so something changed but not sure what!
[13:37:34] <uGoMobi> aiii
[13:37:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, phantomjs has this thing where it stops working if your internet connection drops, even if you're accessing localhost ... 
[13:37:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, it might be calling home to mama, or something ...
[13:37:55] <uGoMobi> push state disabled tests... timeout
[13:38:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Crap! I ran those in Chrome and all was well :/
[13:40:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can you take a look at those? I'm getting a preso together for Wednesday
[13:41:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: You mean the push-state-disabled-tests.html?
[13:41:22] <arschmitz> johnbender: uGoMobi: fixed the prefetch issue
[13:41:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The problem is the unit tests are timing out for me altogether ...
[13:41:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah sorry :(
[13:41:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you have to update your npm install
[13:41:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ^
[13:41:52] <_|Nix|_> Oh! OK.
[13:41:55] <_|Nix|_> Can do!
[13:42:01] <johnbender> the latest version of grunt-junit fixes that issue with the latest phantom
[13:42:04] <johnbender> there was a timing issue
[13:42:11] <johnbender> I managed not to tell you guys o.O
[13:42:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Does it now use phantomjs from node_modules?
[13:42:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no
[13:42:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: lol it's so ghetto
[13:42:27] <johnbender> I just fixed that one issue
[13:42:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP.
[13:43:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nice... there is a ticket for that issue which you can close in your commit
[13:43:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: probably more then one if i can find
[13:43:30] <arschmitz> its a super old issue
[13:43:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I don't care if phantomjs has to be "outside" (/usr/bin) as long as I get the unit tests up and running ...
[13:45:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5677
[13:45:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I ran npm update, but it still seemed to time out - I didn't wait for the actual timeout. I interrupted, did a git clean -x -d -f -f and now I'm doing npm install ...
[13:45:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: could be something new then
[13:45:43] <johnbender> :(
[13:45:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and still no dice :(
[13:45:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the very first thing to check
[13:46:14] <johnbender> is the order in which the qunit injected script gets loaded
[13:46:18] <johnbender> that's in ...
[13:46:20] <johnbender> one sec
[13:46:27] <uGoMobi> I just ran npm install... testing navigation/sequence/ again now
[13:46:35] <uGoMobi> so far so good
[13:46:44] <uGoMobi> and done without error
[13:46:49] <uGoMobi> errors*
[13:47:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: node_modules/grunt-junit/tasks/qunit/qunit.js
[13:52:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm afraid I'm not familiar enough with qunit :/ OTOH, I got it to work with phantomjs 1.8.0 built from source ... go figure ...
[13:53:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It must employ a different load order from 1.7.0 (both source and bin).
[13:54:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh good ... random timeouts ... my old favourite ...
