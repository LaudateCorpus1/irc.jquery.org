[08:55:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: the test are failing in chrome for "Focus is transferred to a menu item when the menue is opened"
[10:35:22] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah, I noticed. That is the test that _|Nix|_ added
[10:37:56] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/56c71b8948b2618493c366e61c0d487a747c0a26#-P0

[12:49:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[12:49:42] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[12:49:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Is there something wrong with the test I added?
[12:50:06] <uGoMobi> yeah looks like it
[12:50:15] <uGoMobi> it's failing
[12:50:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK - I'll check it out.
[12:50:25] <uGoMobi> ok thanks!
[12:53:51] <_|Nix|_> ... and here's the problem: This test passes for me, so I can't reproduce the failure, which means  have to wait for this buildbot every time - and the buildbot only runs like 7 times a day.
[12:54:49] <_|Nix|_> s/means have/means I have/
[12:57:17] <_|Nix|_> I bet phantomjs still doesn't work for me :-S
[12:57:24] <_|Nix|_> Yep - still b0rked.
[12:58:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you test FF or Chrome local?
[12:59:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Both.
[13:00:02] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[13:00:07] <_|Nix|_> I have one failure in FF, but it's not that one.
[13:01:54] <_|Nix|_> I need to get this working with the command line test suite, but that one times out for me, since I'm pretty sure jenkins runs that one.
[13:02:21] <_|Nix|_> Ugh! Reverse the order of the last two sentences.
[13:02:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can you run make on your local copy?
[13:02:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm wondering if I can get you running the tests.
[13:02:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just tested unit/select on FF and it passes but it was hanging for a while when your test was running
[13:02:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... with phantomjs.
[13:03:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's because there's a 5s timeout between steps.
[13:03:18] <uGoMobi> i see
[13:03:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I should bring up the topic of moving $.testHelper.detailedEventCascade from popup_core.js to jQuery.testHelper.js ...
[13:04:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Doing that would allow me to considerably speed up this test.
[13:04:20] <uGoMobi> do I need make? can not be done with grunt?
[13:04:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: make will put grunt into node_modules/.bin
[13:04:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But, if you already have grunt, then no.
[13:05:00] <uGoMobi> i have grunt
[13:05:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You also need phantomjs.
[13:05:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do you have that?
[13:05:14] <uGoMobi> not yet
[13:05:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Feel like trying to get this up and running?
[13:05:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... considering it's Sat night.
[13:06:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure, I can give it try after I finished what I was working on
[13:06:19] <uGoMobi> so i need phantomjs
[13:06:33] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[13:06:46] <uGoMobi> not sure I get the picture already
[13:07:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The idea is that while it works in FF and Chrome, it might fail in phantomjs.
[13:07:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Especially since jenkins runs phantomjs, not FF, and not Chrome.
[13:07:32] <uGoMobi> ok, so I set up phantomjs
[13:07:36] <_|Nix|_> http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/Installation
[13:07:53] <uGoMobi> ok thanks, just downloaded it
[13:08:21] <_|Nix|_> OK, so I guess as long as it's in your PATH, you're ready to go.
[13:08:22] <uGoMobi> but why I need make? can't just run localhost?
[13:08:28] <_|Nix|_> You don't need make.
[13:08:40] <_|Nix|_> I said "run make" because I didn't know whether you had grunt.
[13:09:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so can you run the commandline described in the README.md?
[13:09:29] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:09:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Great!
[13:09:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Are you getting the test failure?>
[13:10:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or are you getting "<WARN> PhantomJS timed out, possibly due to a missing QUnit start() call. Use --force to continue. </WARN>" like me?
[13:11:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hehe not so fast I havent run the test yet
[13:11:17] <uGoMobi> I am setting up phantomjs
[13:11:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ohm OK :)
[13:11:39] <uGoMobi> or better... reading how it works
[13:11:46] <uGoMobi> not much to set up
[13:11:58] <_|Nix|_> What re you running? Linux? Windoze? OSX?
[13:12:53] <uGoMobi> I am on windows now, have Linux too, no OSX yet :(
[13:13:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am looking for the command I have to give
[13:13:19] <_|Nix|_> Cool ...
[13:13:39] <_|Nix|_> JUNIT_OUTPUT=build/test-results/ ROOT_DOMAIN=$WEB_SERVER grunt test
[13:13:58] <_|Nix|_> Where $WEB_SERVER is like http://localhost/path/to/jquery-mobile
[13:14:06] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[13:16:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am getting a parse error
[13:17:07] <uGoMobi> must have made a typo somewhere :(
[13:17:53] <_|Nix|_> Can you paste a gist?
[13:22:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Any luck?
[13:23:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not yet
[13:26:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the JQM readme says you have to have phantomjs installed... I just downloaded and unzipped it, then ran the .exe
[13:27:03] <uGoMobi> have to read a little to understand what I am doing, instead of just doing :)
[13:27:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You have to place the .exe in your PATH.
[13:27:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then you run the above command line from the jqm source root.
[13:30:47] <_|Nix|_> Man! FF is totally unreliable. Sometimes I run the select tests, and they pass, sometimes one fails, sometimes three fail - it's like tossing a coin!
[13:32:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:_ok, looks like it is running
[13:32:52] <_|Nix|_> Nice!
[13:33:40] <_|Nix|_> Hope you get something more than just "<WARN> PhantomJS timed out, possibly due to a missing QUnit start() call. Use --force to continue. </WARN>" ...
[13:33:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it aborts on first test already due to warning
[13:34:05] <_|Nix|_> That warning? ^^^
[13:34:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: haha thats exaclty what I got
[13:34:11] <_|Nix|_> :(
[13:34:13] <uGoMobi> exactly even
[13:34:36] <uGoMobi> but already on the first test (button)
[13:34:39] <_|Nix|_> I don't even know where to begin fixing that ...
[13:35:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender tried to help me, but we got nowhere :(
[13:35:21] <_|Nix|_> I wish I could get a js console or something out to stderr, but I dunno how to do that.
[13:35:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but did you also got problems with the first test already?
[13:35:41] <uGoMobi> or only with the test you added?
[13:37:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The warning means it didn't even get to the point where it runs tests.
[13:37:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, ... bad :(
[13:38:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, no tests failed, and no tests passed, because no tests were run, because there was a timeout right away :(
[13:38:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: strange, when I select a specific unit like so /tests/unit/select/ it still starts with the first test /button/
[13:41:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's not how you select a specific test.
[13:42:29] <_|Nix|_> TEST_PATH=slider JUNIT_OUTPUT=build/test-results/ ROOT_DOMAIN=http://localhost/path/to/jquery-mobile grunt test
[13:42:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: JQM readme: "will only run the tests where the path contains the string slider, eg tests/unit/slider/."
[13:42:54] <uGoMobi> oh ok, lets try that
[13:43:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I predict that you will get the same message :) I'm a pessimist :)
[13:43:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: haha, well I am an optimist but still I expect the same :)
[13:45:45] <uGoMobi> as expected... no dice
[13:55:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I upgraded from phantomjs 1.5.0 to phantomjs 1.6.0 and now it crashes instead of timing out.
[13:55:26] <_|Nix|_> Yaaaay! Progress :-S
[13:55:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hows that for an upgrade :)
[13:55:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am looking at the qunit.js file
[13:56:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender tried to make me add something to the bottom of that file but that didn't help either.
[13:57:46] <uGoMobi> I was looking at the part "launch phantomjs"
[13:58:12] <_|Nix|_> With 1.6.0 it outputs "Running PhantomJS..." before it crashes. With 1.5.0 it doesn't even output "Running PhantomJS..." so I'm assuming it either thinks it ran phantomjs but didn't, or phantomjs runs but does not provide the feedback expected.
[13:58:55] <uGoMobi> has johnbender been able to run it on his own machine?
[14:00:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that launch phantom script points to a location that don't exists... I don't have a qunit folder
[14:01:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Where should you have a qunit folder?
[14:01:39] <uGoMobi> grunt.task.getFile('qunit/phantom.js')
[14:04:39] <_|Nix|_> $ find | grep phantom.js
[14:04:40] <_|Nix|_> ./node_modules/grunt/tasks/qunit/phantom.json
[14:04:40] <_|Nix|_> ./node_modules/grunt/tasks/qunit/phantom.js
[14:04:40] <_|Nix|_> ./node_modules/grunt-junit/tasks/qunit/phantom.js
[14:04:59] <_|Nix|_> So, "qunit/phantom.js" could be referring to one of those files.
[14:05:23] <_|Nix|_> OK, phantomjs was crashing because I had installed it wrong. Now it's back to the old message.
[14:05:34] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[14:07:49] <_|Nix|_> I don't think we'll figure this one out ... and, unfortunately, that probably means fixing the build will be horribly slow ...
[14:08:04] <_|Nix|_> I mean, it hasn't run a build since we started talking about this.
[14:08:19] <_|Nix|_> ... might even be paused over the weekend.
[14:10:47] <agcolom> hello :-)
[14:11:09] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[14:11:18] <_|Nix|_> What's up>
[14:11:20] <_|Nix|_> ?
[14:11:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I give up for now too
[14:11:45] <agcolom> I am wondering if something is incorrect in the docs...
[14:12:02] <agcolom> in this one:http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/selects/options.html
[14:12:50] <agcolom> say teh 1st option: corners. If it is a boolean, why the double quotes?
[14:12:52] <agcolom> $('select').selectmenu({ corners: "false" });
[14:14:21] <agcolom> because in this one: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/options.html
[14:14:40] <agcolom> shadow is a boolean, and gets set with $('.selector').popup({ shadow: true });
[14:15:04] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, seems not necessary to put false between quotes
[14:15:16] <agcolom> but for selects, the same option gets set with $('select').selectmenu({ shadow: "false" });
[14:15:52] <agcolom> does that mean both are correct or one is incorrect?
[14:16:30] <uGoMobi> as far as I know both will work... "false" or just false
[14:16:53] <uGoMobi> but it's not common to put boolean between quotes
[14:17:04] <agcolom> ah, ok. so I'll check with the others to see what we go for then
[14:17:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ^^
[14:17:33] <agcolom> I'm finding it confusing, because I am thinking if it's in quotes it's a string...
[14:19:00] <agcolom> btw, it's rain rain rain here! Not looking good for the olympics!
[14:23:08] <agcolom> johnbender: in http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/selects/options.html 1st option: corners is it normal that it is described as a boolean but the example uses double quotes: $('select').selectmenu({ corners: "false" });
[14:23:56] <agcolom> while the same option in http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/options.html doesn't: $('.selector').popup({ corners: true });
[14:24:12] <agcolom> I am thinking the popup example is correct.

[14:38:41] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, wasn't that difficult... problem is that when you look at a fix for one thing, you often see new issues  :(
[14:39:59] <agcolom> yes, that's why I thought it wasn't simply about removing that one line ;-)
[14:40:12] <agcolom> shame about that placeholder issue as well
[14:40:58] <agcolom> but it looks like you've found the cause so hopefully it can be fixed early next week I would imagine...
[14:41:13] <agcolom> and how's your work going ?
[14:41:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it is working on master
[14:41:24] <uGoMobi> problem is in 1.1.1.
[14:41:28] <agcolom> yes, I saw your comment
[14:42:04] <uGoMobi> so we cant fix until 1.1.2. :(
[14:42:27] <uGoMobi> work is still (far) behind what I planned
[14:42:48] <uGoMobi> when I work on the JQM stuff time is passing by so quickly
[14:43:18] <agcolom> I know... it's good that I have no choice but to go to work... otherwise I'd do this all day ;-)
[14:43:34] <agcolom> My dream is to win the lottery so I can do more JQM ;-)
[14:44:40] <uGoMobi> nah... I never dreamed about the lottery, but we all need to make some money
[14:46:11] <agcolom> (yeah, the problem is I only play about once or twice a year ;-) )
[14:46:57] <agcolom> so how much more do you need to do before you can release your theme?
[14:48:00] <uGoMobi> I have two client projects that are going to use my JQM/WordPress framework + theme, both test versions are ready
[14:48:13] <agcolom> oh that sounds good!
[14:48:38] <uGoMobi> but those were simple versions and there is still a lot I have to add
[14:48:48] <uGoMobi> and a lot that I want to improve :)
[14:49:10] <agcolom> ah, that's the problem...
[14:50:00] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #341: STILL UNSTABLE in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/341/
[14:50:02] <agcolom> do you have other smaller things (quick ones) happening as well, or just those 2 big ones?
[14:50:53] <uGoMobi> just those 2 and 2 things waiting for when I feel my framework is ready
[14:51:43] <uGoMobi> I didn't look for clients on purpose cos I wanted to concentrate on developing
[14:52:08] <agcolom> ok. Maybe blocking a few days to complete it would be a good idea? (how long would it take?)
[14:52:12] <uGoMobi> but at some point you need to make money again... so I am talking with someone to do some sales for me
[14:53:11] <agcolom> well absolutely!
[14:53:35] <uGoMobi> yeah, focus is good
[14:53:58] <uGoMobi> hope to get it done by end of summer
[14:53:58] <agcolom> once your frameworks/theme is ready, then I guess you can just reuse it or adapt it to new clients' needs....
[14:54:12] <uGoMobi> yep thats the idea
[14:54:32] <uGoMobi> I can focus on improving the framework and keeping it up to date
[14:54:46] <uGoMobi> and deliver a custom theme in just a few days
[14:55:18] <agcolom> sounds like a good plan.
[14:56:11] <uGoMobi> the hard part is that while desiging the framework I have to take many different use cases into account
[14:56:31] <uGoMobi> thats why it takes so long :(
[14:56:43] <agcolom> yes, it sounds like a big project.
[14:57:06] <uGoMobi> how many hours do you work at the uni?
[14:57:50] <agcolom> it depends very much on the time of the year, whether I am teaching or not.
[14:58:06] <uGoMobi> I see

[14:58:43] <agcolom> In teaching time, I will be teaching 16h a week, but I am also a course leader and personal tutor and I supervise 8 UG and 2 PG projects
[14:59:04] <agcolom> I need to add the preparation time and marking...
[14:59:16] <agcolom> I have also a lot of admin duties...
[14:59:32] <uGoMobi> so it is a full time job
[14:59:45] <agcolom> yes, it's 35h a week
[14:59:49] <uGoMobi> ok
[15:00:28] <agcolom> I tend to divise my day 8-4 uni, the rest me (jqm, and family)

[15:00:57] <uGoMobi> sounds like a nice balance
[15:01:21] <agcolom> but sometime uni finishes later, depending on the time of year... I can do some stuff from home as well, so evenings and weekends sometimes.
[15:02:25] <agcolom> But I noticed that when I had marking to do or the timetable, it was easy to get completely dragged into the JQM project, because that's much more interesting and rewarding...

[15:04:33] <uGoMobi> I thought you got your students involved sometimes
[15:05:32] <agcolom> no, I teach them JQM and they develop apps with it for Courseworks and projects. So in that sense yes I do. but my students don't contribute to the project yet :-)
[15:05:42] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Boolean options do not need quotes around their values. If they have them, you can remove them without mercy :)
[15:05:53] <uGoMobi> i like the "yet" part of that ;)
[15:05:59] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: thx :-)
[15:06:21] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Sure they contribute - they lend you their devices from time to time, don't they?
[15:06:36] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: oh yes, that's true!
[15:06:42] <uGoMobi> haha
[15:06:54] <agcolom> They're very good for that!
[15:06:56] <_|Nix|_> That's actually a fairly important contribution.
[15:07:09] <agcolom> absolutely!
[15:07:13] <_|Nix|_> One of our primary goals is to work on /every/ device, right?
[15:07:22] <agcolom> Indeed!
[15:07:54] <agcolom> I want to maintain a google doc with all my student devices... We never know, it may come in handy!
[15:08:26] <agcolom> I have 140 in semester 1 and 280 in semester 2!
