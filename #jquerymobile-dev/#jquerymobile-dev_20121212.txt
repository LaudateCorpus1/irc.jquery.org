[07:25:57] <_|Nix|_> awesome!
[07:44:29] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender There are serious problems if the initial URL contains a hash key. If you close a popup, it ends up executing $.mobile.back() twice. The same thing happens when you click the browser's "Back" button while looking at a dialog.
[07:44:29] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[07:46:16] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender It looks like the navigate event being triggered in popstate: function() is causing _handleHashChange to receive an absolute URL as its hash. I don't think it's designed to deal with an absolute URL. However, when I modified the navigate binding to grab the hash off the URL and pass that in, I broke a bunch of things.
[07:46:17] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[07:46:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: quick question for you
[07:46:30] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender So, I'm not sure what to do about that.
[07:46:31] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[07:46:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Waht's up?
[07:47:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: any idea why we are chicking for a parent fieldset here?
[07:47:35] <arschmitz> it makes radio buttons in different fieldsets not update properly https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5366
[07:47:51] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/checkboxradio.js#L157
[07:48:00] <arschmitz> sorry missed pasting the code link lol
[07:48:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NP.
[07:48:40] <arschmitz> we should only be checking page dialog and form i think
[07:48:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good catch.
[07:49:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... on the part of @ucavus ...
[07:49:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i think we should just remove fieldset from the list of parents to check
[07:49:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm, that's an or ...
[07:50:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... so fieldset is found before form?
[07:50:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This should be correct.
[07:50:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ it shouldnt check fieldset at all i dont think
[07:51:13] <arschmitz> thats not a valid form owner
[07:51:17] <arschmitz> for radio
[07:51:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do a git blame and try to find out why it was added.
[07:51:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... before removing it.
[07:53:54] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender it's causing the last member of the special-case-for-dialogs (jquery.mobile.navigation.js:1199 in simple-nav-merge) intersection to be true when it should be false.
[07:53:54] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[07:56:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ its part of the original code
[07:57:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! All the way back to the first commit?
[07:57:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no wait sorry added in 1.03apre

[09:46:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the issue is that we're out of sink with the browser history due to the dialog "replacement"
[09:47:31] <johnbender> it's not adding a history entry so when it goes back we don't have a chance to _anything_
[09:49:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: what's the value of reusing the dialog hash outside of pretty urls/

[10:50:33] <kryl> hi,please,  how to add red backgroup to input if the val is empty for example ?
[10:51:29] <kryl> my question isn't on how to setup the color, $(idDiv).buttonMarkup({theme: 'b'}); but more how to catch the good element around the input field !
[10:52:30] <kryl> if I just change the background of the input it brokes div[data-role="fieldcontain"] just around this element. I need some help pls.
[10:52:38] <kryl> it's just for validation ... with jquerymobile
[12:06:40] <arschmitz> Wilto__: you dont happen to have a way to get a hold of scottjehl do you?
[12:06:49] <Wilto__> Sure do.
[12:07:30] <arschmitz> im wondering why he included fieldset on this line https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/4a9b374eea9da6359f0a605706349680ddebeb26
[12:07:49] <Wilto__> We got this big spotlight on the roof; it projects the silhouette of Scott‚Äôs head in the sky.
[12:07:51] <arschmitz> Wilto__: it makes it so radios in seperate fieldsets dont update each other
[12:08:30] <arschmitz> Wilto__: and it seems out of place since fieldset isnt a valid form owner
[12:08:35] <Wilto__> Hm.
[12:09:54] <Wilto__> Wait, yeah, it can be the parent of form elements. Unless I‚Äôm not reading that right.
[12:10:06] <Wilto__> Er, of inputs and such, rather.
[12:11:08] <Wilto__> ‚ÄîAh, yeah, I see what you‚Äôre saying.
[12:11:28] <Wilto__> You‚Äôll never have a <fieldset> independent of a <form>, so why check there when we can assume a <form> parent.
[12:11:28] <arschmitz> its treating fieldcontain as a form owner essentially
[12:12:13] <arschmitz> fieldset i mean sorry
[12:12:41] <Wilto__> Unless a null form owner is some weird kind of ‚Äútechnically valid‚Äù thing.
[12:13:20] <arschmitz> http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/states-of-the-type-attribute.html#radio-button-state-(type=radio) says they should be associated if they have the same or no form owner
[12:14:14] <arschmitz> technically according to http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#form-owner we shouldnt even check page or dialog either
[12:14:24] <arschmitz> but i think that would be confusing for devs 
[12:15:10] <arschmitz> and since a null form owner is valid if we dont find a form owner we should select all radios with the same name attribute
[12:16:01] <Wilto__> Ah, hm.
[12:16:39] <Wilto__> Yeah, so I guess `fieldset`‚Äôs ‚Äúrelated grouping‚Äù isn‚Äôt strictly‚Ä¶ related grouping.
[12:17:00] <Wilto__> ‚ÄúWeb programming is like jongel and not very productive,‚Äù as they say.
[12:17:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I thought dialogs were supposed to be closeable via the "Back" button.
[12:17:29] <bot-t> (2 hours 14 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ to be clear it doesn't fire the back button twice, it simply doesn't add another history entry so hitting back takes you to the previous page (external)
[12:17:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... which means they need a history entry.
[12:18:04] <arschmitz> Wilto__: yeah its a potentially breaking change though so im thinking we should push to 1.3
[12:19:09] <Wilto__> If the algorhithm for radio states doesn‚Äôt say anything about association based on `fieldset`, I guess we should be following suit.
[12:19:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I guess it's not adding a history entry because the URL it constructs for the dialog is identical to the URL already in the location.
[12:19:22] <arschmitz> Wilto__:im also not sure if we should look for page and dialog or not because even though according to the spec we shouldnt i kinda think we should because without ajax nav it would not be an issue
[12:19:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... if the initial URL already has the hash key.
[12:19:41] <Wilto__> Wait‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm getting a vision. A voice from beyond (‚ÄúFlorida‚Äù) is trying to contact me.
[12:22:13] <Wilto__> Please hold.
[12:22:51] <Wilto__> arschmitz: We have an issue for this?
[12:23:13] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5366
[12:24:39] <Wilto__> wait the spirits are speaking to me now
[12:24:57] <Wilto__> ‚Äúsince jQM works in a single dom, it's not uncommon for people to have the same form pulled in twice in the DOM, and suddenly ID issues. I think we found it would be faster to find pairs within the closest shared descendent. I guess we figured fieldset and form were safe tries‚Äù
[12:25:36] <arschmitz> Wilto__: i agree on page dialog and form of course im just questioning fieldset
[12:25:49] <Wilto__> ‚Äúanyway. I would git blame that line to see what the change came from. remove if it looks harmless‚Äù
[12:26:00] <Wilto__> Whew, oh, hey guys. I blacked out for a second there. Did I miss anything?
[12:26:03] <arschmitz> Wilto__ i did thats what i sent he first time
[12:26:15] <arschmitz> that was a git blame of scottjehl ading it
[12:26:23] <arschmitz> thats why i asked for him
[12:26:26] <Wilto__> Yeah, he (and I) are both on board with scratching out `fieldset`.
[12:26:58] <Wilto__> Lookin‚Äô like the reasoning was that it seemed like a safe enough way to find grouped items without always crawling up to the page level.
[12:27:15] <Wilto__> But if they don‚Äôt *technically* imply grouping, yeah, no sense in us enforcing it.
[12:28:07] <Wilto__> As my Grandfather used to say, back when I was a boy: ‚Äúif the HTML5 spec is flexible on a certain point, so too should jQuery Mobile.‚Äù
[12:28:19] <Wilto__> It was a really confusing thing to say, for a long time.
[12:28:32] <arschmitz> Wilto__: I can see that only with time did his wisdom show
[12:29:44] <Wilto__> True, true.

[12:47:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... definitely.
