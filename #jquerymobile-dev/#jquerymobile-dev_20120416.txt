[08:54:54] <gseguin> Good morning everyone!
[09:09:28] <deAtog> Hello gseguin
[09:10:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/BZLjeA
[09:10:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [widget] Took widget from jQuery UI 1.9m7 - Fixes: #3544 - Gabriel Schulhof
[09:10:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #4054 from gabrielschulhof/updated-jquery-ui-widget - Ghislain Seguin
[09:12:26] <toddmparker_> hi all
[09:13:19] <toddmparker_> so gseguin - you pulled in _|Nix|_'s widget factory update? Looked like that was easy
[09:13:35] <gseguin> yeah, we had talked about previously
[09:13:40] <gseguin> with _|Nix|_
[09:13:48] <toddmparker_> great
[09:13:59] <gseguin> I think pulling it in early will let us find possible bugs early
[09:13:59] <toddmparker_> that alone is a nice improvement for 1.2
[09:14:03] <toddmparker_> exactly
[09:14:11] <toddmparker_> best to live with it for a long while
[09:14:27] <toddmparker_> are we almost ready to ask people to alpha test the download builder?
[09:14:33] <toddmparker_> i've had a few volunteers
[09:14:37] <gseguin> I think we're ready
[09:14:47] <gseguin> we just need to host that page somewhere
[09:15:04] <deAtog> either of you want to take a stab at this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3980 reverting the guilty revision corrects the behavior on my Android device.. but the old code looks a little suspect..
[09:15:04] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3980 on jquery-mobile (konrado; 1w, 2d ago): 1.1 RC2, Android, data-rel back doesn't work correctly in some cases
[09:16:12] <gseguin> deAtog: I can look into that on Wednesday maybe
[09:16:47] <deAtog> ok
[09:17:20] <toddmparker_> so gseguin - do we just need to pop that page up on jquerymobile.com/download-builder
[09:17:42] <gseguin> yup I think that'll work
[09:18:04] <toddmparker_> ok
[09:18:13] <toddmparker_> do you have access to the server?
[09:18:17] <gseguin> Is it just me or does the name not make sense?
[09:18:33] <gseguin> why not "bundle builder"?
[09:18:36] <toddmparker_> download builder?
[09:18:59] <gseguin> but who am I to ask, english as a second language
[09:19:07] <toddmparker_> heh
[09:19:17] <toddmparker_> you are building a custom version for download
[09:19:26] <toddmparker_> not sure bundle means much to me
[09:19:38] <toddmparker_> i was following the UI convention: http://jqueryui.com/download
[09:19:55] <gseguin> ok
[09:20:07] <gseguin> then it's me ;)
[09:20:21] <toddmparker_> you will lost every language conflict to me, frenchie
[09:20:36] <gseguin> heh :)
[09:20:46] <johnbender> toddmparker_: let me know if there's anything super pressing otherwise I'm going to be working on my railsconf preso
[09:20:57] <toddmparker_> ok johnbender
[09:21:08] <toddmparker_> think we jsut need to keep plugging away of PR reviews, bug fixes, etc.
[09:21:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: cool
[09:21:22] <toddmparker_> good thing anne is back tohelp me look thru issues
[09:21:24] <gseguin> also should we offer an option to bundle jQuery in our custom download?
[09:21:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: when I get back from railsconf I was going to work on the grunt and testswarm setup
[09:21:49] <gseguin> or custom package (as in the .js file)
[09:21:55] <johnbender> so I'll split time with prs
[09:22:00] <johnbender> sound good?
[09:22:01] <toddmparker_> ok johnbender
[09:22:10] <toddmparker_> so gseguin
[09:22:16] <gseguin> I'm totally interested in helping with that johnbender
[09:22:26] <johnbender> gseguin: it would be greatly appreciated
[09:22:35] <toddmparker_> ar eyou asking whether we should package core into the js fine or just include it along with mobile (separate file)
[09:22:52] <toddmparker_> or at all
[09:23:05] <gseguin> in the js file
[09:23:25] <gseguin> as a separate js would actually be a lot more work
[09:23:54] <toddmparker_> hmm
[09:24:17] <toddmparker_> i think for now we should keep it simple and just generate the custom mobile js and css files
[09:24:26] <toddmparker_> let 'em grab jQ
[09:24:28] <gseguin> ok
[09:24:34] <toddmparker_> nice idea tho
[09:25:05] <gseguin> let's poll alpha users on whether they would be interested in such a feature
[09:25:08] <toddmparker_> tbenzige: you around?
[09:25:12] <toddmparker_> yeah gseguin
[09:25:30] <toddmparker_> does remove a request if people aren't using a server-side concat tool
[09:25:37] <tbenzige> hey guys
[09:25:55] <gseguin> indeed
[09:26:11] <toddmparker_> hey tyler
[09:26:32] <toddmparker_> just checking to see if you've seen thsoe few TR issues float by over the weekend
[09:26:36] <tbenzige> yeah
[09:26:48] <tbenzige> im on them now
[09:26:51] <tbenzige> icon stuff is fixed
[09:26:54] <toddmparker_> looks like there might be some import hiccups
[09:26:55] <tbenzige> not seeing the import error though
[09:26:58] <toddmparker_> sweet
[09:27:00] <tbenzige> have you seen any?
[09:27:01] <toddmparker_> thanks!
[09:27:29] <toddmparker_> nope, but one was on windows and my 11 air isn't set up with windows
[09:28:21] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/yoOMzw
[09:28:21] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Update README.md - Jasper de Groot
[09:28:21] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #4058 from uGoMobi/patch-17 - Todd Parker
[09:29:14] <toddmparker_> custom link colors not importing is probably easy to repro.
[09:29:53] <toddmparker_> this one is odd - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4056
[09:29:56] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4056 on jquery-mobile (nightbook; 8h, 31m ago): Themeroller upgrade from 1.01 to 1.1 imported and left unused swatches
[09:30:23] <toddmparker_> wonder if he has a theme that isn't contiguous - a,d,f,g,m
[09:30:31] <toddmparker_> what happens at import?
[09:30:55] <toddmparker_> maybe you fill in swatches for all letters in between
[09:32:28] <tbenzige> hmm maybe? i need to see his theme to know
[09:32:34] <toddmparker_> yeah
[09:33:04] <toddmparker_> also just noticed that they posted the issues in the jQM tracker, not yours. I closed them with a note but theya re all linked here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4056
[09:33:04] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4056 on jquery-mobile (nightbook; 8h, 34m ago): Themeroller upgrade from 1.01 to 1.1 imported and left unused swatches
[09:36:58] <tbenzige> Yeah I moved the issue to https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/87
[09:36:58] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #87 on web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller (TylerBenziger; 2m, 34s ago): Themeroller upgrade from 1.01 to 1.1 imported and left unused swatches

[09:40:51] <toddmparker_> gseguin - feel free to upload that builder to the site today if you have access
[09:45:25] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I do have access
[09:45:39] <gseguin> I'll do that later today
[09:48:54] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[09:49:05] <toddmparker_> gimme a shout when its up and i'll email a few testers
[09:54:25] <gseguin> toddmparker_: it's up: http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[09:54:43] <gseguin> I didn't realise it was just a clone to do
[09:55:58] <toddmparker_> that was fast :)
[09:56:43] <toddmparker_> so this is hitting your server for the dep map
[09:56:53] <toddmparker_> and the zip build, right
[09:57:05] <toddmparker_> any idea how much traffic it cna handle
[09:57:21] <johnbender> gseguin: so g'damn hot
[09:57:36] <johnbender> the amd work bearing serious fruit
[09:57:46] <gseguin> I think it'll do just fine
[09:58:02] <gseguin> it would be good to add some google analytics in there
[09:58:04] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did you tweet people to send you emails?
[09:58:12] <toddmparker_> yeah
[09:58:13] <gseguin> to figure out what the traffic is
[09:58:14] <johnbender> cool
[09:58:18] <toddmparker_> so it'll be 5 people
[09:58:40] <toddmparker_> just wondering for the future if we wanted a wider beta test
[09:59:05] <gseguin> I think it'll do just fine
[09:59:38] <gseguin> it's gonna be serving only static files quickly
[09:59:53] <johnbender> gseguin: nice so it does have the file system caching setup
[09:59:54] <johnbender> win
[09:59:58] <gseguin> it will build the same config only once
[10:00:28] <gseguin> then serve it from disk the next time it's being asked
[10:11:01] <tbenzige> hey gseguin: download builder isnt working in Firefox
[10:11:32] <gseguin> DAMMIT FIREFOX!
[10:11:37] * kinblas confirms
[10:11:37] <tbenzige> all i see is this: http://awes0.me/download-builder.png
[10:12:00] <gseguin> thanks for letting me know, I'll check
[10:12:11] <kinblas> gseguin: it doesn't work in Opera either
[10:12:18] <kinblas> only Safari and Chrome
[10:12:19] <kinblas> for me
[10:12:32] <gseguin> ok
[10:12:39] <gseguin> I'll check
[10:14:30] <gseguin> looks like an exception in underscore
[10:32:49] <johnbender> gseguin: underscore doesn't work in ff and opera?
[10:32:50] <johnbender> wtf
[10:33:08] <gseguin> I'd be very surprised
[10:33:14] <johnbender> gseguin: me too
[10:33:19] <gseguin> It's most likely a user error
[10:33:19] <johnbender> :D
[10:57:01] <gseguin> toddmparker_: Fixed on FF. /cc kinblas, tbenzige
[10:57:12] <gseguin> though it needs some CSS love on FF
[10:58:12] <gseguin> still not fixed on Opera
[11:32:41] <gseguin> BTW should we have the semicolons debate here too?
[11:32:55] <gseguin> seems like the cool thing to do these days
[11:34:08] <fcheslack> jqm autobuild should insert random chaos-monkey semicolons just to see what happens.
[11:34:56] <gseguin> heh :)
[12:30:37] <johnbender> gseguin: there is no debate
[12:30:42] <johnbender> use semicolons :D
[12:49:37] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll say what I've said to everyone who has asked me about this
[12:50:06] <johnbender> the type of engineer who uses semi colons cares about preventing "possible" issues in the future with their code
[12:50:39] <johnbender> aesthetics is less important to them in most cases than code that works well in the long term where that's a tradeoff
[12:50:50] <johnbender> in other words, good engineers use semicolons
[12:51:05] <johnbender> :D
[14:12:00] <deAtog> johnbender: ping
[14:15:05] <johnbender> deAtog: pong
[14:18:13] <deAtog> I've been looking at issue #3980...
[14:19:24] <deAtog> it seems Android causes a hashchange event to occur when the url changes from say: desource.dyndns.org/~atog/jqm/three.php to desource.dyndns.org/~atog/jqm/two.php
[14:19:52] <johnbender> deAtog: the commit you posted makes perfect sense for the cause
[14:20:09] <johnbender> if you can post your findings there we'll probably try to address that one for 1.1.1
[14:20:36] <deAtog> well.. I think I have a fix.. If you've got time to discuss..
[14:23:16] <johnbender> deAtog: I don't right now, if you send a pull request it's easier to talk about becaus I can see the code
[14:23:25] <johnbender> that would be super helpful
[14:25:00] <deAtog> ok.. I'll put something together to let you review
[14:28:39] <johnbender> deAtog: thanks
[16:21:58] <LakWork> Not sure if you guys care, but we launched our jquerymobile ecommerce site this past weekend. http://m.scorebig.com
[16:22:44] <LakWork> Great work on the framework :]
[16:35:06] <LakWork> I added reproduce steps for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3980

[21:24:55] <joshuabud> Anyone here?
[21:25:09] <joshuabud> I'm having an issue with the final version after updating
[21:25:18] <joshuabud> it has to do with buttons in the header and footer
[21:26:07] <joshuabud> I simply replaced the .css and .js files
[21:26:19] <joshuabud> and changed the page link names
[21:28:53] <joshuabud> the headers and footer themed regions ar not tall enough for the icons
