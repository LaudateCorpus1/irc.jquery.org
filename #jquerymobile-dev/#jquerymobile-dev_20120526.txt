[02:24:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: goodmorning Anne
[02:24:43] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[02:25:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you were talking about powered by JQM during this weeks call...
[02:25:25] <uGoMobi> http://jquery.org/about
[02:25:39] <uGoMobi> shouldn't the logo be up there
[02:26:14] <uGoMobi> at least people can create their own badge (is that how you call it?)
[02:28:41] <agcolom> Yes, good idea... we can mention to toddparker that it'd be a good idea to add the jQuery Mobile logo there as well.
[02:29:04] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ^^^
[02:35:54] <agcolom> ok, time to take my daughter to her swimming class... Have a great weekend, may catch you later...
[02:38:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks, you too!

[09:09:44] <uGoMobi2> toddparker: ^^^ do you agree adding a back button to nested list pages by default should get milestone 1.2 ?

[16:56:33] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: ?
[16:56:46] <uGoMobi> hey MauriceG
[16:57:43] <MauriceG> hi! nice to see you!  #2004. time for short look?
[16:58:08] <uGoMobi> sure
[16:59:43] <MauriceG> for windows phone there is a hack with filter()
[17:00:27] <uGoMobi> how does that work?
[17:01:42] <uGoMobi> BTW - didn't you created a PR related to labels and ID's?
[17:01:47] <MauriceG> replacing this filter() with filter( function() { return ... } ) works on my browsers. but I have no win phone
[17:02:04] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[17:02:26] <uGoMobi> you can ask toddparker to test
[17:02:58] <MauriceG> ok. thanks. create a fiddle.
[17:04:19] <uGoMobi> i have a quick look at the current code
[17:10:08] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: strange that just filter() can't handle dots, maybe something that jQuery core should look into
[17:10:22] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: but nice fix! hope it works on WP
[17:10:57] <Wilto> Filter? Hack? We’re on my turf, now.
[17:11:30] <uGoMobi> hey Wilto
[17:11:56] <MauriceG> filter may looks for classes in the string
[17:12:02] <Wilto> Ohh.
[17:12:21] <Wilto> Yeah, I switched that to `filter`.
[17:12:27] <uGoMobi> thats a good point
[17:12:29] <Wilto> If I’m thinking of the right thing.
[17:13:29] <Wilto> Huh, yeah. Thought I commented that with a specific issue…
[17:14:07] <MauriceG> without "what the hell...".   :-)
[17:14:32] <Wilto> Did I write that? I wouldn’t put it past me.
[17:14:48] <uGoMobi> NOTE: Windows Phone could not find the label through a selector filter works though.
[17:15:14] <Wilto> Yeah, I don’t think I ever nailed down exactly why…
[17:15:34] <uGoMobi> but with Maurice his fix for id's with dots in it, it is still using filter
[17:16:10] <MauriceG> yes. for this I was looking for filter().  but what a nice note ... Wilto
[17:16:47] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I was just looking into one of your other hacks
[17:16:53] <uGoMobi> also IE/WP
[17:17:03] <Wilto> uGoMobi: I love the weird ones, I won’t lie.
[17:17:07] <uGoMobi> filter opacity .0001
[17:17:10] <uGoMobi> haha
[17:17:17] <Wilto> Oh no. Selects?
[17:18:11] <uGoMobi> yes
[17:18:38] <uGoMobi> button in form, not sure only selects, also submit i think
[17:18:51] <Wilto> I had to sacrifice a chicken to get that stuff working everywhere.
[17:18:56] <Wilto> 100% witchcraft.

[17:19:10] <Wilto> Got an issue for that one?
[17:19:15] <Wilto> Good timing.
[17:19:16] <uGoMobi> :-)
[17:19:37] <uGoMobi> and... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2743
[17:19:38] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2743 on jquery-mobile (titoliviolustosa; 7m, 1w ago): Problem when clicking the button label still remains in IE.
[17:19:59] <Wilto> Uh oh.
[17:20:08] <Wilto> Yeah, I’m callin’ dibs on these issues.
[17:20:28] <Wilto> That stuff is so crazy tweaky—any little change in there means testing on every-damn-thing.
[17:20:36] <uGoMobi> opportunity here to fix two issues at the same time... how does that feel? ;-)
[17:21:04] <Wilto> I like that juuust fine.
[17:21:20] <Wilto> I can’t believe the damage you guys are doing to the numbers. I owe everybody a beer.
[17:21:26] <uGoMobi> yeah i can image... i saw background transparent didnt work and had to be set with rgba
[17:21:37] <uGoMobi> which doesnt work on IE
[17:21:48] <uGoMobi> haha
[17:21:52] <Wilto> Lotta weird stuff in play there, yeah.
[17:22:00] <Wilto> I’ll get after these on Tuesday; no worries.
[17:22:18] <uGoMobi> current count... 430 open issues
[17:22:54] <Wilto> Hell yeah.
[17:22:57] <uGoMobi> it's just like memory game... hey i have seen this before, but where
[17:25:11] <uGoMobi> ok guys... i am gonna call it a day
[17:25:37] <uGoMobi> Wilto: MauriceG: enjoy the rest of the weekend!
