[00:58:13] <frequent> uGoMobi: morning
[00:58:24] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[00:58:36] <uGoMobi> how are you?
[00:58:42] <frequent> fell of the map...
[00:59:05] <frequent> holiday, trainee to counsel and mountain of work :-)
[00:59:26] <frequent> I think my workpile is the highest mountain in the Lille area
[00:59:26] <uGoMobi> aii :)
[00:59:33] <frequent> but
[00:59:46] <frequent> I still want to try to get a first version of the filter widget in
[00:59:48] <frequent> still time?
[01:00:07] <uGoMobi> yeah
[01:00:37] <uGoMobi> still a lot to do before we can release 1.4 alpha or beta
[01:01:24] <uGoMobi> frequent: arschmitz and _|Nix|_ are going to work on widget refactors
[01:01:48] <uGoMobi> might be good to talk with them so everyone is on the same page
[01:02:11] <uGoMobi> we also have to do some "branch management"
[01:03:07] <uGoMobi> frequent: BTW - I only had time to have a quick look at your table PR, sorry
[01:11:00] <frequent> uGoMobi: np
[01:11:24] <frequent> re table bugfix
[01:53:04] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15steelywing opened issue #6039: "-webkit-transform:translate3d(0,0,0)" make some android browser link not working  02http://git.io/tl3xhA
[06:06:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Morning
[06:06:46] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[06:07:38] <arschmitz> i commented on your textarea issue
[06:07:51] <arschmitz> i agree ditch the transition not worth it
[06:08:33] <arschmitz> but the shrink grow logic was a little off kept several extra lines in the text area that were impossible to use instead of just one like we have currently
[06:08:48] <arschmitz> i updated the jsbin and posted it
[06:09:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, thanks
[06:10:13] <uGoMobi> I just created a quick example to see if it works
[06:10:29] <arschmitz> yeah i think that looks like the way to go though
[06:10:35] <uGoMobi> I noticed that it already grows after first char
[06:10:54] <arschmitz> yeah we have css that fixes that in the library
[06:11:20] <arschmitz> i think this is essentially the way to go though 
[06:11:43] <uGoMobi> and I saw that we need to use a bit diferent code for Opera
[06:11:46] <arschmitz> its simple 
[06:11:53] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:11:57] <arschmitz> i didnt look at opera
[06:12:04] <uGoMobi> neither did I
[06:12:25] <uGoMobi> but in the original code that I found in a blog post there was something about Opera
[06:12:33] <arschmitz> ah ok
[06:12:52] <arschmitz> also commented on the textarea autogrow with fixed toolbars
[06:13:04] <arschmitz> basicly its ios and not much we can do
[06:13:31] <arschmitz> there is no such thing as fixed position while the keyboard is open
[06:14:17] <arschmitz> i really hate that in ios lol
[06:14:54] <uGoMobi> right
[06:15:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BTW - what CSS were you referring to for the textarea
[06:15:57] <uGoMobi> that we set a height as starting point?
[06:16:12] <arschmitz> yeah and the padding and box-sizing
[06:16:26] <arschmitz> a whole bunch of things that basicly make it work out so its already the right size
[06:16:56] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:17:27] <arschmitz> yeah i didnt get into it too much just looked at the css and saw that stuff and checked the js to make sure it wasent something else
[06:19:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: here is that Opera thing... var offset= !window.opera ? (t.offsetHeight - t.clientHeight) : (t.offsetHeight + parseInt(window.getComputedStyle(t, null).getPropertyValue('border-top-width'))) ;
[06:20:35] <arschmitz> yuck
[06:20:38] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:20:58] <uGoMobi> sounds a bit same as the issue with swipe
[06:21:01] <arschmitz> i mean its not as bad as it looks its really not a big deal but ... yuck lol
[06:21:07] <uGoMobi> that was Opera too, right?
[06:21:12] <arschmitz> no ios
[06:21:16] <uGoMobi> and something with FF
[06:21:18] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[06:21:30] <arschmitz> maybe opera too i never use opera lol 
[06:21:58] <uGoMobi> I use it for testing :)
[06:22:09] <arschmitz> yeah i should test on it more
[06:22:13] <arschmitz> i always forget about opera
[06:22:16] <uGoMobi> noticed that Opera Mobile has been renewed
[06:22:21] <arschmitz> i have it on my devices of course 
[06:22:41] <uGoMobi> it comes with an Off Road setting or something like that
[06:22:47] <uGoMobi> which means ... no JS :/
[06:23:05] <arschmitz> oh fun im sure that works great on most sites :|
[06:23:24] <uGoMobi> well it saves some Kb
[06:23:43] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:23:51] <uGoMobi> anyway... now I know what browser I need to use when I want to test C-grade
[06:23:58] <arschmitz> long as you dont care about most of the websites you go to working
[06:24:00] <arschmitz> true
[06:24:29] <uGoMobi> well it's just a setting and not turned on by default
[06:24:54] <arschmitz> yeah im just spouting off lol most browsers have a way to turn of js lol
[06:25:18] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[06:26:06] <arschmitz> ios you can in the device settings under safari
[06:28:04] <uGoMobi> yeah, Opera brings it as a new feature... in the main settings menu there is a flip switch to turn it off
[06:28:25] <uGoMobi> I don't think it's just turning off JS
[06:28:37] <uGoMobi> maybe switch to proxy too
[06:28:40] <uGoMobi> I dunno
[06:28:53] <arschmitz> ah ok that seems like a weird feature to tout if it just turns of js
[06:29:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok offraod isnt turning off js
[06:30:01] <arschmitz> and isnt truely new
[06:30:09] <arschmitz> its the old opera turbo mode renamed
[06:30:32] <uGoMobi> oh I see
[06:30:56] <arschmitz> "while the engine has changed, key features remain intact. Youâ€™ll still find the bandwidth-saving Opera Turbo feature, but itâ€™s been renamed Off-Road mode. The name switch makes sense, since Opera Beta generally performs much better than its Android siblings when compression is disabled. In effect, Webkit and V8 already have Opera Beta running at Turbo speeds. Off-Road is a nice, non-techy description of when O
[06:31:33] <uGoMobi> I was looking here http://www.opera.com/nl/help/mobile/guide
[06:31:39] <uGoMobi> but no tech details there
[06:32:33] <arschmitz> yeah no real description where i looked either
[06:33:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://www.opera.com/turbo
[06:33:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when I enable Opera Turbo on desktop JQM works
[06:33:43] <arschmitz> i guess it just proxys and compresses the data
[06:33:48] <uGoMobi> when I turn on Off-Road on Android JQM becomes C-grade
[06:33:52] <arschmitz> weird
[06:34:00] <arschmitz> they say they are the same thing
[06:34:22] <arschmitz> opera mobile is still beta though right?
[06:35:30] <uGoMobi> don't think so
[06:35:38] <uGoMobi> version doesn't say beta
[06:35:48] <arschmitz> hmm im not sure then
[06:36:15] <arschmitz> i have not seen anywhere where it says js is disabled though
[06:36:37] <arschmitz> i should make a test page with just an alert
[06:36:59] <uGoMobi> nah that was just what I thought because JQM pages weren't enhanced anymore
[06:37:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: try this with it i dont have my androids with me
[06:37:31] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ikucat/1
[06:37:49] <arschmitz> its just a blank page with an alert on body onLoad
[06:38:28] <uGoMobi> I get the alert
[06:38:51] <arschmitz> we will have to log an issue for that i guess then because it should work i think
[06:39:35] <arschmitz> on the bright side at least it goes cgrade not busted
[06:41:26] <uGoMobi> well... now I get a timeout
[06:41:39] <arschmitz> hmm
[06:41:42] <uGoMobi> was trying master on view
[06:42:08] <uGoMobi> server time limit error
[06:42:37] <uGoMobi> Opera's proxy server overloaded ?
[06:42:54] <arschmitz> i would assume its something on their end with the proxy server
[06:43:01] <arschmitz> because master is up and running just fine
[06:43:38] <uGoMobi> yeah, even jquerymobile.com homepage doesn't load
[06:43:40] <arschmitz> i can log in and check server load but i dont think theres any issue i didnt see any delay in loading it
[06:43:59] <arschmitz> lol yeah and there is not much going on there
[06:44:05] <arschmitz> its just wordpress lol
[06:44:14] <uGoMobi> works fine if I turn off that Off-road feature
[06:44:32] <arschmitz> hmm looks like they need to do some work on that then
[06:44:48] <arschmitz> at least it shows its nothing on our end
[06:46:09] <uGoMobi> yeah, problem will resolve itself... if you can't load any website with that feature enabled you probably disable it :)
[06:51:31] <arschmitz> yup
[09:08:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: wow popups with selects in them do not like old android
[09:08:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I know
[09:08:56] <uGoMobi> it's like you click right thru them, right?
[09:09:04] <arschmitz> nope
[09:09:07] <uGoMobi> ohw
[09:09:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6034#issuecomment-18414420
[09:12:26] <arschmitz> i dont have my actual androids with me right now but im going to grab them when i get luncj
[09:13:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the issue he describes is what I meant
[09:13:27] <uGoMobi> there are more tickets about this
[09:13:38] <uGoMobi> maybe closed
[09:13:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i figured but i cant confirm that
[09:14:11] <uGoMobi> I have an 2.3.6 device here
[09:15:00] <arschmitz> yeah i think he reported it on 2.2
[09:15:17] <arschmitz> i have a 2.2 its just at home on the table lol
[09:15:41] <arschmitz> but try on the 2.3.6 and see what you get
[09:15:57] <arschmitz> i got that ones overlaying a select on a page work fine
[09:16:07] <arschmitz> but ones overlaying the popup button dont function at all
[09:16:19] <arschmitz> they get highlight but dont open the select
[09:16:32] <arschmitz> but also dont trigger the button 
[09:16:36] <arschmitz> underneath
[09:17:24] <uGoMobi> might have to do with the transparency we set for the native
[09:17:34] <arschmitz> maybe
[09:18:17] <arschmitz> transparency can be wierd on android
[09:18:19] <uGoMobi> or more likely... the position absolute
[09:18:33] <arschmitz> god old andoird is so f'ed
[09:18:35] <uGoMobi> yeah, were issues with that on WP too
[09:19:30] <uGoMobi> on my 2.3.6 device the popup opens but when I click on the select buttons inside nothing happens
[09:19:43] <arschmitz> thats what i saw
[09:19:48] <arschmitz> top and bottom ones work fine
[09:19:54] <arschmitz> but middle two dont work
[09:20:01] <uGoMobi> it's probably good to test this outside JS Bin
[09:20:08] <arschmitz> yeah i agree
[09:20:30] <arschmitz> once i have my actual devices this afternoon ill throw a test page on my server and check it out
[09:20:39] <uGoMobi> even the "edit with JS Bin" button can cause the issue
[09:20:50] <uGoMobi> for me none of the 4 buttons respond
[09:20:54] <arschmitz> yeah and it does blink weird when i click those middle two
[09:21:01] <arschmitz> oh really hmm
[09:21:03] <uGoMobi> this device has very small screen though
[09:21:11] <uGoMobi> think it's 240 x 360
[09:21:15] <arschmitz> top and bottom worked fine for me on every version on browser stack
[09:21:40] <uGoMobi> I mean that the position can be different from your device
[09:21:46] <arschmitz> yup
[09:21:48] <uGoMobi> popup position
[09:22:05] <arschmitz> i was galaxy s and sII on browserstack
[09:22:54] <arschmitz> i honestly dont understand how these versions of android got past quality control lol
[09:23:04] <arschmitz> they are so so broken lol
[09:23:31] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:23:56] <arschmitz> well did you hear google pulled the guy in charge of chrome off and he is now in charge of android 
[09:24:06] <arschmitz> to try and whip android into shape
[09:24:27] <arschmitz> because they recognised how broken andoird truely is
[09:25:05] <uGoMobi> I heard that the guy who founded android was leaving, not about who replaced him
[09:25:11] <arschmitz> thats never a good sign
[09:25:15] <uGoMobi> true
[09:25:37] <uGoMobi> although 4.2 is a lot better already
[09:25:37] <arschmitz> but hey maybe he will get andoird straightened out and as good as chrome
[09:25:43] <arschmitz> oh for sure
[09:26:00] <arschmitz> aside from maybe 3 they have been making progress lol
[09:26:24] <uGoMobi> yeah 3.x was a joke
[09:27:02] <arschmitz> and hey chrome while not perfect is probably the best out right now so if he can make andoird get in shape im all for it lol
[09:28:22] <uGoMobi> yeah true, although I got the feeling that chrome has more bugs lately than before
[09:28:31] <uGoMobi> rendering bugs
[09:28:40] <uGoMobi> and rounding issues
[09:28:48] <arschmitz> yeah its far from perfect
[09:28:56] <arschmitz> just better then the rest lol
[09:29:13] <arschmitz> rounding issues drive me insane sometimes though
[09:29:14] <uGoMobi> oh very true
[09:29:32] <arschmitz> and sometimes makes NO SENSE
[09:29:36] <uGoMobi> yes me too
[09:29:43] <arschmitz> i was working on a range slider
[09:29:46] <arschmitz> not jqm
[09:30:00] <arschmitz> and was getting a nasty rounding issue that was messing with the fill hilight
[09:30:08] <arschmitz> the fix was adding 5
[09:30:17] <arschmitz> just a random generic 5
[09:30:26] <uGoMobi> o_O
[09:30:54] <arschmitz> it's width  was all jittery because of rounding add 5 rock solid 
[09:31:26] <arschmitz> blew my mind i was like what why isnt it just jittering 5 px wider why does this matter?
[09:31:31] <uGoMobi> insane
[09:32:05] <arschmitz> yeah so if you ever have rounding issues try just adding an int to it might fix it lol
[09:32:20] <uGoMobi> another really annoying bug is that the layout isn't updated after resizing when you use MQ's
[09:32:38] <arschmitz> oh yeah but only em based ones if im not mistaken
[09:32:41] <uGoMobi> yeah will remember your trick
[09:32:53] <arschmitz> though i think thats fixed in nightly as of like a month or two ago
[09:32:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: at first I also thought it was only with em based MQ
[09:33:14] <uGoMobi> but later on I also noticed it when using px value
[09:33:18] <arschmitz> hmm
[09:33:33] <uGoMobi> oh ok, will test again on canary
[09:33:56] <arschmitz> yeah if im not mistaken the filament guys ended up really getting into it with some webkit people and they finally patched it
[09:36:07] <arschmitz> ha ha no wonder i could not reproduce that issue
[09:36:22] <arschmitz> in his actual page he has changed popup to position:fixed
[09:36:33] <arschmitz> meaning selects are 100% nonfunctional and click through
[09:37:38] <uGoMobi> ah the position fixed + position absolute issue again
[09:37:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: are there already issues for the other stuff i saw or should we just edit this issue?
[09:38:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if so they have the Android label
[09:38:26] <arschmitz> yeah this isnt a library issue though so i would close that just wondering about the other stuff we were seeing 
[09:38:29] <uGoMobi> not sure
[09:39:30] <arschmitz> nope nothing on these
[09:39:33] <uGoMobi> it might also be a good idea to test there kind of issues with CSS/JS from next
[09:39:43] <arschmitz> true
[09:39:59] <arschmitz> do you think we should close this one and open new one or just edit this one?
[09:40:03] <uGoMobi> the simplified markup might improve things
[09:40:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can only hope
[09:40:38] <uGoMobi> whatever is convenient
[09:41:00] <arschmitz> there is already history on this one so ill just edit
[09:41:07] <uGoMobi> okay sounds good

[10:56:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6034 ... so, attempting to open the select inside the popup while the select overlaps the button that opened the popup is causing issues?

[11:15:11] <johnbender> agcolom: unlikely

[11:15:23] <johnbender> agcolom: proceed

[11:15:38] <johnbender> none of us can reproduce locally

[11:23:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: reproduced on his actual device
[11:24:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! You have a device identical to the OP's?
[11:25:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I bet it's a st00pid events-leaking-through-despite-default-being-prevented problem.
[11:26:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, we may have to add a if ( e.isDefaultPrevented() ) { return; } to one of our handlers.
[11:27:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure if its identical but i have the same version at least
[11:27:12] <_|Nix|_> Great ... I can't run browserstack from this st00pid WLAN :/
[11:27:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome! I'm sorry I can't help :(
[11:28:05] <arschmitz> thats ok 
[11:28:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd've loved to see the button text showing up on top of the popup :O
[11:28:17] <arschmitz> lol yeah that was a fun one
[11:28:23] <arschmitz> i dont have a real 4.0 phone though
[11:28:28] <arschmitz> only 4.1 
[11:28:35] <arschmitz> which worked perfect

[11:31:02] <arschmitz> if it overlaps the popup button OR any of the selects on the page
[11:31:06] <arschmitz> non functional
[11:31:50] <arschmitz> thats on an htc thunderbolt 4g
[11:32:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: To be clear: Are you talking about http://jsbin.com/avopah/2/?
[11:32:34] <arschmitz> yup
[11:32:37] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:32:58] <_|Nix|_> Lemme try it again on my Samsung Galaxy SII running Android 2.3.5 in Android Native Browser.
[11:33:00] <arschmitz> im checking android 2.2 now
[11:33:20] <arschmitz> ha SII was the 2.3 device i checked on browser stack that did it
[11:34:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, browsertrack runs emultaros though, right? It's not like they have a camera pointed at the real decice and a robot arm with a capacitive pointer ...
[11:35:17] <_|Nix|_> That'd be awfull cool though, eh?
[11:35:31] <arschmitz> lol well not quite an emulator but basicly
[11:35:51] <arschmitz> according to their description they are actual roms of the device from the manufacturer
[11:36:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so, just to be clear. When you click on a select inside the popup, you clean in the region of the select that overlaps part of the button/select underneath it, right?
[11:36:50] <arschmitz> yes
[11:37:01] <arschmitz> though as far as i can tell where you click does not matter
[11:37:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or does it even matter? Does it work if you click on a portion of the select inside the popup that does not overlap any of the page selects/buttons?
[11:37:07] <arschmitz> just that it overlaps
[11:37:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You answered my question before I posed it :)
[11:37:34] <arschmitz> lol
[11:37:51] <arschmitz> oh damn my other android is not 2.2 its 2.3.4
[11:38:09] <_|Nix|_> Well, I can't reproduce it. All my in-popup selects work fine, regardless of whether they overlap anything or not :/
[11:38:18] <arschmitz> ok so on htc incredible 2.3.4 and on htc thunderbolt 2.3.7 both show that
[11:38:33] <_|Nix|_> On my silicon/glass/plastic Android 2.3.5.
[11:38:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: are you portrait or landscape
[11:38:37] <arschmitz> ?
[11:38:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good point. Portrait. Trying Landscape.
[11:39:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was portrait too :|
[11:39:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You were portrait in browserstack?
[11:40:05] <arschmitz> yea thats what it normally defaults to?
[11:40:14] <arschmitz> but you can flip it in browser stack 
[11:40:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I tried both IRL and both work ...
[11:41:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: weird and i watched your video your doing right thing
[11:41:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course, clicking on the popup's screen causes the event to bleed through to the selects on the page, so the same click that closes the popup, opens the select on the page.
[11:41:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Good! That's reassuring.
[11:42:03] <arschmitz> guess you some how have the lucky working device
[11:42:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Must be the aura of my Linux laptop. It reminds the Android device of its roots. Gives it good vibes.
[11:43:17] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah guess my mac makes it angry competitor and al
[11:43:35] <arschmitz> oh but uGoMobi: is normally on linux
[11:44:04] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:45:45] <_|Nix|_> Ooooooohhhmmm (Î©)
[11:46:25] <_|Nix|_> Well, I totally give up :/
[11:46:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah basicly its getting the tap but no click
[11:46:49] <arschmitz> so it gets highlight but does not open select
[11:47:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Woah! Like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5991?
[11:47:26] <arschmitz> basicly yeah
[11:47:35] <arschmitz> but only when overlapping 
[11:47:46] <arschmitz> what is weird is there is no click through
[11:47:58] <arschmitz> its not like the element below is recieveing the click
[11:48:04] <arschmitz> nothing appears to get it
[11:48:15] <arschmitz> on android its normally a click through issue
[11:48:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IINM, vmouse sometimes swallows click and emits its own click, right?
[11:48:43] <arschmitz> i think so 
[11:48:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe there's the problem.
[11:48:54] <arschmitz> maybe 
[11:55:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: welcome back
[12:06:24] <_|Nix|_> Man ... WTF?! github is really slow updating the contents of gabrielschulhof.github.io ... I've pushed master a while back and the new files still aren't showing up :(
[12:08:11] <_|Nix|_> OK, WTF?! WP7.5 doesn't do iframes?
[12:08:22] <arschmitz> what? really?
[12:08:49] <arschmitz> i never noticed that on my wp7.8
[12:08:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's IEMobile 9.0 ...
[12:09:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I haven't upgraded.
[12:09:13] <arschmitz> have a link?
[12:09:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IINM IE was upgraded to 10 silently, right?
[12:09:32] <arschmitz> on desktop yeah i think so
[12:09:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://gabrielschulhof.github.io/test-pages/6025-nofb/6025.html - don't be surprised if you get a 404 though ...
[12:10:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: github is taking forever to update :/
[12:10:27] <_|Nix|_> OK ... NM ... it's up.
[12:10:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Access it with IE 9 ... the custom select inside the iframe is not supposed to work. It's supposed to cause a full page reload.
[12:11:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's no longer 404. I just checked.
[12:13:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i get blank iframe on wp7.8
[12:13:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So do I on WP7.5 ...
[12:14:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Try IE9/desktop.
[12:14:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: jsbin.com out put is blank too
[12:14:24] <arschmitz> so i think your right
[12:14:33] <arschmitz> just straight no iframe
[12:15:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[12:15:11] <arschmitz> desktop is also blank on actual ie9
[12:15:21] <_|Nix|_> What?! Seriously? WTF?!
[12:15:23] <arschmitz> but i KNOW iframes work in ie9 lol
[12:16:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/gabrielschulhof.github.com/blob/master/test-pages/6025-nofb/6025.html
[12:16:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: and https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/gabrielschulhof.github.com/blob/master/test-pages/6025-nofb/6025-iframe.html
[12:16:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What am I doing wrong?
[12:16:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait, maybe cus it's using style for width/height.
[12:16:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i cant open any iframe in ie9
[12:16:47] <arschmitz> not even a jsbin
[12:16:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: WTF?!
[12:17:24] <arschmitz> oh take that back
[12:17:34] <arschmitz> cant open any iframe with jqm master
[12:17:44] <arschmitz> take jqm out and all good
[12:17:48] <arschmitz> thats bad
[12:18:19] <arschmitz> nope nix that even what is going on !!!
[12:18:23] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/1/edit works fine
[12:19:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. So jQM in IE iframe = h0rkage?
[12:19:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but http://jsbin.com/avopah/2/edit does not!!!
[12:20:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok figured it out
[12:20:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm not getting any output on either in WP7.5 ...
[12:21:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do tell.
[12:21:15] <arschmitz> its jqm + core 1.9 + iframe
[12:21:29] <arschmitz> core 1.8 is fine
[12:21:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Great ... ?
[12:21:56] <arschmitz> yeah im not sure let me see if there are any errors in console
[12:22:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh yeah errors abound
[12:23:18] <arschmitz> but going to not be fun to find
[12:24:14] <arschmitz> "unspecified error" on line 3254 of core
[12:24:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Great!
[12:24:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess core abandoned IE9 even before 2.0 ...
[12:24:40] <arschmitz> ha ha right below that line is a note about supporting ie9
[12:24:46] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:25:21] <arschmitz> yeah ie8 busted as well
[12:25:27] <arschmitz> its something about triggering focus
[12:26:15] <arschmitz> ie10 is ok
[12:29:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/5645947
[12:31:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm i can get an android 2.2 for $20 in the same town i live in might be worth it lol
[12:32:35] <_|Nix|_> Not bad ...
[12:32:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Try to reproduce the bug on the phone before you buy it :)
[12:33:08] <arschmitz> lol
[12:33:36] <_|Nix|_> Alright. Me go lunch now. Not too much luck reproducing stuff :/
[12:33:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that fb issue
[12:33:59] <arschmitz> we have / had a note in docs about not working with facebook oAuth
[12:37:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: commented with link
[12:41:44] <agcolom> is toddmparker around? 
[12:43:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: have not seen him today
[12:53:52] <agcolom> arschmitz: ok, thanks :-)
[13:10:42] <toddmparker> hi all
[13:10:48] <toddmparker> here i am agcolom 
[13:11:14] <agcolom> Hi toddmparker, i just had a question regarding the meeting notes
[13:11:32] <agcolom> should I also copy across the theme meeting notes?
[13:12:55] <toddmparker> agcolom: sure
[13:13:08] <toddmparker> well, actually maybe not
[13:13:21] <toddmparker> note sure how much we're going to do from that
[13:13:52] <agcolom> ok, I'm not done yet ;-) so we have time to think whether we want it in or not... 
[13:14:56] <agcolom> Would you like to think about it first or is that no for sure? (we can always add it later...)
[13:15:20] <agcolom> BTW it is so nice to go back and read the old minutes :-) 
[13:20:45] <agcolom> toddmparker: also it seems that we can't change the title of the minutes so all they would have the wrong heading (jQuery Mobile Team Meeting)
[13:25:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The thing about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6025 is that he seems to have reproduced it without FB as well, and I've also seen it happen without FB, albeit randomly.
[13:25:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's hard to reproduce reliably.
[13:26:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i see hmm i didnt look into it much i just saw nav and facebook and it spurned my memory
[13:28:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. If you could try the non-fb link (http://gabrielschulhof.github.io/test-pages/6025-nofb/6025.html) in IE9/desktop, that would really help, because, if you can't reproduce it there either, then either the page I built does not capture the problem, or it really is irreproducible.
[13:28:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: checking it now
[13:28:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome! Thanks! My Windoze laptop is currently about 8kmi away :)
[13:29:04] <arschmitz> lol yeah i just use browser stack for ie now
[13:29:21] <arschmitz> still have a windows desktop and laptop but dont use them
[13:30:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they made a chrome plugin so i can just click it and pick a version and it loads the current page right up in ie 
[13:30:12] <arschmitz> slick....
[13:30:32] <arschmitz> ok so i just need to click the ones that "cause navigation" and it should cause it to go back?
[13:31:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[13:31:21] <arschmitz> ok well it does not happen for me 
[13:31:25] <_|Nix|_> Ooooh! Listening to a talk about Enyo :)
[13:31:28] <arschmitz> everything works as expected
[13:31:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you also check http://jsfiddle.net/RpW22/
[13:31:59] <_|Nix|_> ?
[13:32:11] <arschmitz> no prob
[13:32:49] <_|Nix|_> Unfortunately, the iframe is from the API docs, so we can't really change it without major headaches ...
[13:33:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the fiddle uses 1.9 so totally blank
[13:33:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right ...
[13:33:50] <_|Nix|_> ... so I don't get how he reproduced it in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6025#issuecomment-18351112
[13:34:20] <arschmitz> hmm so this one is still blank even when i switch to 1.8
[13:35:03] <arschmitz> oh because you dont even need jquery in the fiddle because its the docs and its in there and using 1.9
[13:35:07] <_|Nix|_> )_o ...
[13:35:34] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, of course ... so, again, I ask: How could the OP have reproduced the issue?
[13:35:44] <_|Nix|_> Looks more suspicious by the second.
[13:35:45] <arschmitz> no idea
[13:36:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are there multiple versions of IE9?
[13:36:10] <arschmitz> not that i know of
[13:36:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or maybe it was IE10 in IE9 mode?
[13:36:22] <arschmitz> very very possible
[13:36:29] <arschmitz> people always think its the same thing
[13:36:33] <arschmitz> its REALLY not
[13:37:03] <_|Nix|_> More and more I'm thinking that this is a waste of time ...
[13:37:34] <arschmitz> yeah all examples are missing in ie9 on api.jquerymobile.com
[13:37:44] <arschmitz> because the iframes are busted
[13:38:16] <arschmitz> im going to try and reporduce the problem with ie9 and iframes i think i know the cause
[13:38:29] <arschmitz> i think trying to set fouce inside an iframe is busting it
[13:38:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wow! Really?
[13:39:29] <arschmitz> yeah setting up a test now
[13:40:44] <arschmitz> BOOM!
[13:40:47] <arschmitz> yup
[13:40:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/etedun/1/edit
[13:40:59] <arschmitz> causes the error
[13:41:09] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: you around?
[13:41:32] <DaveMethvin> yep arschmitz
[13:41:52] <arschmitz> calling .focus(); on an element inside an iframe is busted in 1.9.1
[13:42:05] <DaveMethvin> how about 1.10.0?
[13:42:09] <arschmitz> throws "unspecified error"
[13:42:13] <arschmitz> ill check right now
[13:42:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: An IE iframe, right?
[13:42:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Things work elsewhere, right?
[13:42:32] <DaveMethvin> we shoudl have fixed it
[13:42:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: correction: oldIE iframe, right?
[13:42:44] <arschmitz> yes any iframe
[13:42:47] <arschmitz> yes
[13:42:55] <DaveMethvin> basically any mention of document.activeElement before onload causes certain death
[13:43:02] <_|Nix|_> Wow!
[13:43:53] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: its fine in 1.10.0
[13:44:06] <DaveMethvin> well we fixed something, yay!
[13:44:10] <arschmitz> lol
[13:44:25] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:44:26] <DaveMethvin> don't worry we'll break it in 1.10.1
[13:44:33] <arschmitz> sounds like a plan
[13:45:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How am I supposed to get the error using http://jsbin.com/etedun/1/edit?
[13:45:21] <arschmitz> load it in ie lol
[13:45:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK. Got it :)
[13:45:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, it /is/ IE only ... you said any iframe.
[13:46:14] <arschmitz> oh sorry no ie <= 9
[13:47:02] <arschmitz> so i guess we need to upgrade to 1.10.0 ASAP
[13:47:04] <arschmitz> in docs
[13:48:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[13:48:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can do it.
[13:48:21] <arschmitz> sweet
[13:48:31] <arschmitz> i found an example the other day still using 1.7 lol
[13:49:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I'm planning on using sed
[13:49:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, it should be systematic.
[13:50:00] <arschmitz> cool

[14:14:32] <agcolom> toddmparker: the whole of 2013 is up :-) 
[14:15:04] <agcolom> that's 17 meeting. 38 more to do... for tomorrow... and possibly sunday :-)
[14:15:18] <agcolom> meeting minutes ^
[14:20:22] <uGoMobi_> huh
[14:21:59] <uGoMobi> I think I was disconnected for long time
[14:22:05] <uGoMobi> did I miss anything?
[14:23:27] <agcolom> Hey Jasper :-)
[14:23:33] <uGoMobi> hey Anne
[14:24:07] <agcolom> I don't know, I'm deep into moving 2 or 3 years of meeting minutes to the blog :-)
[14:24:26] <agcolom> I spotted something though... 
[14:25:02] <agcolom> http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/ doesn't look quite right...
[14:25:13] <agcolom> I guess you're still working on it?
[14:25:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[14:25:50] <uGoMobi> that's completely broken
[14:26:13] <agcolom> ah yes, i thought it didn't look right :-)
[14:26:14] <uGoMobi> we use a lot of custom CSS for the docs that needs to be updated
[14:26:34] <uGoMobi> demo center I mean
[14:26:36] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:29:07] <agcolom> ok :-)
[14:29:42] <agcolom> I think I have to call it a day... 
[15:58:31] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... bit of a bug. If the footer contains nothing but a button, it doesn't get the height needed and the footer is nothing but a thin band with the button below it. I need to add <h1>&nbsp;</h1> for the footer to be given height.
[16:01:14] <_|Nix|_> OK ... NM .. I'm doing something wrong.
