[08:54:09] <mspisars> ?afaik
[08:54:13] <bot-t> mspisars, #10902 (ability to test a built version of jQuery in unit tests) – jQuery ... - Opened 11 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10902
[08:54:31] <mspisars> way off
[08:54:33] <mspisars> :)
[11:18:15] <_|Nix|_> Wow! Really bad! phantom does not work if there's no Internet connection!
[11:18:31] <_|Nix|_> At least in our testing setup.
[11:23:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I seem to recall something like that, odd
[11:23:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to simple-nav: http://git.io/AyCxcQ
[11:23:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/simple-nav] todos and push state glob catch - John Bender
[11:23:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/simple-nav] adapt the event cascade abstraction to clean up navigate tests - John Bender
[11:23:50] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin http://git.io/AyCxcQ
[11:23:51] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[11:24:00] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin fine for now
[11:24:01] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[12:05:54] <johnbender> scottjehl__: do you think you could spare like 20 minutes next week to discuss some of the nav stuff I'm working on?
[12:07:00] <johnbender> scottjehl__: I was going to loop in Wilto and maybe _|Nix|_ if I can just to get some early feedback to make sure I'm not going down the wrong path
[12:08:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/-JJ9sQ
[12:08:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [testHelper] Documenting the ability to add a timeout to the list of events, and some whitespace changes - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:08:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [testHelper] Fix up detailedEventCascade to properly deal with timeouts - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:08:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup unit tests] Add test that checks whether li link is deactivated when a popup is opened from it, and overhaul the tests to use detailedEventCascade - they were exploding mysteriously - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:08:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Maybe on team-day?
[12:09:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that would be fine with me
[12:09:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's turning out really really good so far
[12:09:32] <johnbender> but I want to amke sure I'm not doing anything especially stupid
[12:09:35] <johnbender> I'
[12:09:47] <johnbender> I'm also trusting in the law of "good foundations"
[12:09:57] <johnbender> not the first time I've done this with software
[12:10:14] <johnbender> If the underlying ideas and implementation of something are solid, benefits will magically appear down the road
[12:10:23] <johnbender> aside from the one's I've already considered
[12:10:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can it handle all the unit tests? Does the premise for some of the tests no longer hold (IOW, do some need to be modified/removed because the new nav simply works differently)?
[12:11:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: not really
[12:11:04] <johnbender> no
[12:11:14] <johnbender> we don't do any navigation tests based on the things I'm working on
[12:11:18] <johnbender> they're all at the integration level
[12:11:32] <johnbender> "pagechange"
[12:11:40] <johnbender> I'm at the very bottom of the stack
[12:11:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What about the sequence tests? Those are simply, you know - go to another page, open a dialog, etc.
[12:11:45] <johnbender> normalizing hashchange and popstate
[12:11:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: they'll stay the same
[12:12:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, as long as navigate events are being issued on queue, it should all be fine.
[12:12:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: those should stay the same
[12:12:55] <johnbender> actually what I'm working on right now will do very littel in the way of altering our existing code aside from discarding the pushstate plugin
[12:13:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's actually great!
[12:13:20] <johnbender> yes
[12:13:34] <_|Nix|_> It's the smoothest possible transition imaginable.
[12:13:42] <johnbender> we'll see
[12:15:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Also, if it eliminates that annoying Im-not-going-to-touch-up-URLs-for-the-next-300ms, that's an insane win in terms of reducing setTimeout()s in unit tests. You'll be rediscovering whole new parts of your soul ;)
[12:15:47] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes
[12:16:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it looks like that'll end up being a side effect of this (the squashing of the url with replaceState happens right after setting the hash) but there may be subtle issues
[12:16:36] <johnbender> so we'll see
[12:16:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Like, for instance, I had to leave, like 300ms between unit tests, because one unit test ends by going from a dialog state to a normal page, and the next one starts by going to a dialog state. The latter one wasn't getting touched up.
[12:17:58] <_|Nix|_> Well, definitely, I mean, the crucible of in-the-wild is irreplaceable.
[12:41:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/E9LOXQ
[12:41:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added file inputs to the auto init so they now receive consistent theme styling. Fixes #5050 - toddparker
[12:44:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/S9yF_g
[12:44:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [testHelper] Expanding slightly on the documentation of the event source parameter for detailedEventCascade - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:46:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/y8Gfow
[12:46:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [testHelper] Typo - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:55:07] <_|Nix|_> Where's our jsbin template? It's no longer mentioned in README.md ...
[12:55:21] <_|Nix|_> I need to throw it at a bug reporter.
[12:57:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's in the CONTRIBUTION.md
[12:57:33] <todd> hey all
[12:57:39] <uGoMobi> hi todd
[12:57:44] <todd> irc cloud has been suer wonky
[12:57:48] <todd> what did i miss?
[12:58:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks! I just fount it.
[12:58:19] <uGoMobi> I had the same problem with IRCCloud
[12:58:23] <_|Nix|_> todd: Not much ...
[12:58:46] <_|Nix|_> todd: johnbender wants to have a chat about his nav changes.
[12:58:55] <_|Nix|_> todd: 20 minutes.
[12:59:00] <_|Nix|_> todd: I suggested team day.
[12:59:27] <todd> that seems like a good idea
[12:59:38] <todd> since it's getting to be the end of the day here
[13:01:54] <uGoMobi> I will make the tickets on the dev-summit repo now
[13:09:45] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: you there?
[13:09:46] <bot-t> (1 hour 45 mins ago) <johnbender> tell gseguin http://git.io/AyCxcQ
[13:09:46] <bot-t> (1 hour 45 mins ago) <johnbender> tell gseguin fine for now
[13:10:43] <gseguin> johnbender: that'll do indeed
[13:11:41] <todd> uGoMobi: looks like we just added the same new issue
[13:11:42] <todd> ha
[13:12:14] <uGoMobi> ah
[13:12:41] <todd> I just closed yours since mine has some more links and such
[13:12:44] <uGoMobi> todd: I will close mine
[13:12:46] <todd> great minds...
[13:12:48] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:12:52] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:13:09] <uGoMobi> I will update the link in the roadmap and dev-summit ticket
[13:14:28] <uGoMobi> BTW - I like the way the sliding panel works in the YouTube app
[13:14:50] <uGoMobi> the menu is already in place so it's just the content that slides to the right
[13:15:19] <gseguin> johnbender: any reason why it would take 600+ms from $.mobile.path.set to 'hashchange' on PhoneGap ?
[13:15:55] <todd> uGoMobi: that is a nice one
[13:16:04] <todd> do you think this ticket is a dupe? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3855
[13:16:32] <todd> see these other 3 responsive items already
[13:16:32] <todd> https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/wiki/Table-15:-Mobile-Dev-&--UI-Testing
[13:16:45] <todd> sliding panels and the stacking grids
[13:17:46] <uGoMobi> 3855 is actually more about multiple panes, not simple grids
[13:18:12] <todd> that won't be supported in 1.3 if it means history and deep linking
[13:19:27] <uGoMobi> yes I know so it's probably not the right ticket for adding a few more grids (25/75, 33/66, etc)
[13:19:40] <todd> maybe i'll make a new one for that
[13:20:54] <todd> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5164
[13:20:57] <uGoMobi> I changed 3855 to milestone 1.6
[13:21:01] <uGoMobi> thanks
[13:21:02] <todd> ok, cool
[13:21:13] <uGoMobi> will add that to dev-summit ticket
[13:33:16] <johnbender> gseguin: maybe they're hooking that?
[13:33:32] <johnbender> gseguin: With phonegap you can't assume that they haven't shimmed the api somehow
[13:34:07] <gseguin> true, problem is, it makes jQM apps very slow almost unusable
[13:35:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: What's up?
[13:35:54] <gseguin> was going to ask up, what I asked Bender
[13:36:18] <gseguin> because the problem manifest when you click a data-rel="popup" link
[13:36:35] <gseguin> it takes almost a second to open the popup
[13:38:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, because popup waits for the hashchange as well.
[13:38:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I remember there was a problem if it doesn't.
[13:38:26] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I forget what the problem was.
[13:38:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You can turn off history tracking, but then you lose the back button.
[13:38:56] <gseguin> yeah no I want the back button
[13:39:13] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... I gotta figure out what the problem was.
[13:39:18] <gseguin> I also want to figure out why the triggering of "hashchange" takes so long
[13:39:33] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Sounds like a pg issue.
[13:39:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Or maybe jquery.hashchange.js ... ?
[13:39:56] <johnbender> gseguin: which phonegap platform?
[13:40:06] <gseguin> no because it doesnt happen in mobile web
[13:42:00] <johnbender> gseguin: it'd be interesting to see if it behaves the same in a non phonegap webview
[13:42:14] <johnbender> in iOS you can "Save to homescreen" to see if it's reproducible I think
[13:42:17] <johnbender> not sure about the others
[13:43:09] <gseguin> I'll try that
[13:44:07] <johnbender> gseguin: if you get stuck I can always ping our internal mailing list on phonegap issues to see if there's any alteration taking place
[13:45:10] <gseguin> thanks johnbender
[13:47:40] <gseguin> johnbender: definitely a phonegap issue
[14:02:42] <johnbender> gseguin: sigh
[14:03:02] <johnbender> gseguin: do you want to fish around maybe try #phonegap (which is usually a dead end) and I'll email the list internally?
[14:03:10] <johnbender> do you have a test case or anything I can point to?
[14:03:29] <gseguin> I'll build one
[14:03:55] <gseguin> thing is I'm using 1.7.0
[14:04:12] <johnbender> gseguin: do you have a phonegap build account setup?
[14:04:21] <gseguin> I do
[14:04:22] <johnbender> it's really easy to produce apk's and whatnot for testing in that case
[14:04:25] <johnbender> nice
[14:04:41] <gseguin> I don't know if it happens on android
[14:04:50] <gseguin> my concern is iOS at the moment

[14:36:47] <Wilto> jQuery Mobros attending the Dev Summit: REPORT IN.
[14:36:51] <Wilto> Anyone still kicking around in here?
[14:37:00] <Wilto> Weâ€™re sorting out the devices weâ€™re bringing along.
[14:47:20] <_|Nix|_> What's up?
[14:50:40] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #763: FAILURE in 23 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/763/
[14:52:35] <Wilto> Just curious about what everyone is bringing along.
[14:56:27] <johnbender> :/
[14:56:37] <johnbender> looking into it
[14:58:58] <Wilto> I blame myself.
[14:59:09] <Wilto> johnbender: Whatâ€™s this Jenkins CI deal I was hearing about earlier?
[14:59:16] <johnbender> ?
[14:59:21] <Wilto> Do we, yâ€™knowâ€¦ want one. Of that?
[14:59:24] <Wilto> I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m saying.
[14:59:38] <johnbender> Wilto: is this a joke or a serious question :)
[14:59:55] <Wilto> Serious semi-question. Jeff here at FG was talking about it.
[15:00:04] <Wilto> I only caught bits of it.
[15:00:06] <johnbender> we run all our tests on jenkins for JQM
[15:00:21] <Wilto> Oh, I thought he was saying this was some likeâ€¦ remote-hosted dealie.
[15:00:23] <johnbender> Jeff and I talked about it briefly
[15:00:35] <johnbender> Wilto: well it is, it's part of the jquery infrastructure
[15:00:42] <johnbender> but we don't pay for a jenkins service perse
[15:00:46] <Wilto> Oh, oh. Okay.
[15:10:59] <johnbender> alright
[15:11:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 5 new commits to master: http://git.io/DvakJA
[15:11:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] add config to disable base changes all together - John Bender
[15:11:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] add tests for disabling base tag support and url alteration - John Bender
[15:11:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] account for push state disabled tests - John Bender
[15:11:05] <johnbender> I'm going to take a look at those sequence tests
[15:11:11] <johnbender> though they pass in the browser :/
[15:12:35] <gseguin> johnbender: nevermind my simple testcase doesnt show the problem
[15:25:22] <johnbender> gseguin: hrm
[15:25:40] <johnbender> gseguin: let the fun begin I guess?
[15:26:01] <johnbender> gseguin: question
[15:26:06] <johnbender> gseguin: is it when the back button is hit?
[15:26:57] <johnbender> or when we use $.mobile.back() ?
[15:34:33] <gseguin> johnbender: it happens when I open a popup through an <a data-rel="popup"
[15:35:41] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #764: STILL FAILING in 24 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/764/
[18:24:27] <johnbender> gseguin: it does wait until the pagebeforechange fires to do it's work
[18:24:47] <johnbender> gseguin: I actually didn't monkey with the link handler
[22:30:30] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin the infrastructure team is using Vagrant to make setup at the summit easier. I'd like to get you setup to use it so that if it makes sense, people who want to work on jqm could also use it
[22:30:32] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[22:35:11] <JonahSchulte> Sounds good to me :)
[22:46:22] <johnbender> :)
[22:46:37] <johnbender> JonahSchulte: I've got a Vagrant branch if you're interested
[22:47:27] <JonahSchulte> sure
[22:52:48] <JonahSchulte> What sort of setup is it? I have a local web server running and have jquery/jquery mobile forked and can build them with grunt no problem
[22:53:04] <johnbender> JonahSchulte: it builds a VM and provisions it with Apache
[22:53:12] <johnbender> thereby avoiding file system clutter
[22:53:15] <johnbender> among other things
[22:53:15] <JonahSchulte> nice
[22:53:30] <johnbender> http://vagrantup.com
[22:53:35] <JonahSchulte> Yeah I've got that installed
[22:53:43] <JonahSchulte> Just was wondering what you had on your branch
[22:54:03] <johnbender> https://github.com/johnbender/jquery-mobile/tree/vagrant
[22:54:10] <johnbender> I just jump the branch
[22:54:12] <johnbender> resume
[22:54:20] <johnbender> checkout whichever branch I'm working on
[22:54:26] <johnbender> and jump back when I want to suspend
[22:54:28] <johnbender> painless
[22:58:10] <JonahSchulte> nice, I will try that out! thanks
[23:11:10] <johnbender> JonahSchulte: let me know if you have issues or questions
