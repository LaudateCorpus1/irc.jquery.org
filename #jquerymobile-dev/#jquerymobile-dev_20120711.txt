[06:11:19] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Hi! Around?
[06:11:35] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[06:12:14] <MauriceG> Hi!  opening the Popup page raises a message in the console.
[06:12:45] <uGoMobi> error for the video you mean?
[06:12:51] <MauriceG> yes
[06:13:01] <uGoMobi> yeah I know
[06:13:16] <uGoMobi> didn't see it on all browsers
[06:13:51] <uGoMobi> something about it wasn't safe because of different protocol or something like that, right?
[06:13:59] <MauriceG> right
[06:14:12] <MauriceG> and ...  I'm on Win XP - Safari 5.1.7 (finally) the new photos breaks the browser somehow ...
[06:14:14] <uGoMobi> any idea how we can fix that? it's just a Vimeo video in an iframe
[06:15:01] <uGoMobi> yes we know
[06:15:28] <uGoMobi> just uploaded them so we can see the issue
[06:15:45] <uGoMobi> working on a fix now
[06:16:15] <MauriceG> I just get a black screen ...
[06:16:29] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: could you Google that error on the video to see if there is an easy fix for that?
[06:17:10] <uGoMobi> black? the semi-transparent overlay or full black?
[06:18:06] <MauriceG> and sometimes a weird screen.
[06:18:53] <MauriceG> i make a screen shot
[06:19:02] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[06:19:53] <uGoMobi> I have a system with Win XP and Safari 5.1 so I will check on that one too
[06:24:53] <MauriceG> http://test.jqmobile.de/img/popup2.png  -  yes, it looks like a broken vga adapter ...
[06:26:05] <uGoMobi> wow
[06:46:00] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: ... and I see some really weird things with popups.  Are you able to look at flash sides?
[06:51:47] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yes
[06:55:30] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: http://test.jqmobile.de/img/popup.swf.html
[06:56:06] <MauriceG> and http://test.jqmobile.de/img/popup2.avi
[06:56:58] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Woah!
[06:57:06] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: What browser?
[06:57:43] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: I use Safari 5.1.7 on Windows XP
[06:58:09] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Strange that the click should be making it through to the button below the open popup.
[06:58:49] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_:   sorry ...
[06:58:55] <MauriceG> and Hi!
[06:59:15] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Hey! NP ... problems are good - they make the code better.
[06:59:30] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Just look at popups on Android 2.3.5 ... XD
[06:59:35] <uGoMobi> hi _|Nix|_
[06:59:53] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I though my Chrome should play swf but it doesnt somehow
[06:59:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[07:00:13] <uGoMobi> thought*
[07:00:17] <MauriceG> may it just cause of poor performance of my PC ?
[07:01:03] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Hmmm ... I can't reproduce what you showed in the video in 5.1.7 on Windoze 7 ( which is the only one I have :-S )
[07:01:08] <MauriceG> it starts to puff and blow when I open and close some popups
[07:01:50] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Weird. Can you try with two popups that are not so close together?
[07:02:05] <MauriceG> I will try on another XP VM ...  I have to install Safari first
[07:02:25] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Like, "Theme set to A" and "Overlay set to A">
[07:02:27] <_|Nix|_> ?
[07:02:38] <MauriceG> The problem I've shown are not on a vm btw
[07:02:57] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: The point is that, when you click outside a popup, the click is not supposed to be sent to the element beneath the popup.
[07:03:05] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: It's supposed to be eaten by the overlay.
[07:03:07] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_:  ok
[07:03:19] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: If that's not happening, we have a problem.
[07:20:03] <MauriceG> This time I'm unable to open any popup with overlay ...
[07:20:31] <MauriceG> I just get black and weird screens like the screenshot above ...

[07:36:05] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi  It seems, "don't use popups with older PCs". Using Safari on XP on a parallels VM OS X and Safari on Mac, the popups are working great!
[07:39:26] <MauriceG> the new photos are looking very beautiful, uGoMobi. agcolom did a good job finding them... Also the css looks great (on a Mac screen so far).
[07:40:17] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: we might need a bit less heavy photos though
[07:40:47] <uGoMobi> but they look great yes
[07:41:15] <uGoMobi> problem is the non-webkit browsers
[07:41:38] <uGoMobi> the portrait photo blows out of the screen
[07:42:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when we keep it possible to have a scrollable popup, we have a problem with the overlay
[07:48:27] <MauriceG> to give the popups some more fire, you can use: http://test.jqmobile.de/img/hotchair.jpg
[07:57:21] <tbenzige> johnbender: ping
[08:20:09] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: go http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[08:20:17] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: open a popup
[08:20:48] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: click into the browsers address bar and enter an url
[08:21:17] <MauriceG> browse to that url and click the browsers back button
[08:21:26] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: open a popup ...
[08:26:54] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: that's weird.  On one PC (XP/Safari 5.17) I'm unable to use the browsers back button to come back to the popup page
[08:27:47] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: on another PC (Same OS/browser), I come back to the popup page, opening a popup brings me back to the entered URL ...
[08:32:26] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Wow! Another navigation problem ...
[08:32:28] * _|Nix|_ go check
[08:34:42] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: OK - reproduced in Chrome.
[08:35:43] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: FF 12 / Linux works fine.
[08:38:02] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Weird - it only happens with jquerymobile.com ... doesn't happen with my local copy ... weird ...
[08:40:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I see the problem ... the portrait photo causes the document height to increase, and the screen does not increase to compensate, right?
[08:40:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can resize the screen ...
[08:54:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think about this: Do not go beyond the bottom of the page if the popup would fit on the page?

[09:21:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup] Allow for the popup to increase the overall height of the document - resize the screen past the bottom of the page if this happens. Fit to the bottom of the document when large, unless that would result in a negative top coordinate - Gabriel Schulhof
[09:30:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah thats better already
[09:30:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I still think we should make it possible to make content (image) fit the screen
[09:31:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: YOu mean, like, with scrollbars?
[09:31:47] <uGoMobi> no, no scrollbars
[09:31:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What then?
[09:32:25] <uGoMobi> I mean, it should be possible to make an image shrink and scale so it fits the screen
[09:32:51] <uGoMobi> right now, this works on webkit browsers only
[09:33:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I see what you mean - I guess they auto-scale images, eh?
[09:33:17] <uGoMobi> no
[09:33:26] <uGoMobi> I set a rule max-height 100%
[09:33:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This may not be a task for jQM though. If authors want to do this, they need to add their own handling to the images.
[09:33:53] <uGoMobi> difference is what the browser defines as the parent container
[09:34:10] <_|Nix|_> Definitely.
[09:34:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes ok, but the problem is that right now it is impossible to do this with CSS
[09:34:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I could add some signals to popup - like "opening".
[09:35:17] <agcolom> Hi Everyone !
[09:35:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then, you can .bind( "opening", function() { ... }) and calculate the size you need there.
[09:35:21] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[09:35:39] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[09:35:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I already have "opened", and "closed", but those are too late.
[09:36:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think the framework should offer the possibility to make an image fit
[09:36:29] <agcolom> 1st day without pain killers and I have survived :-) (ok, it's only because I forgot them this morning!)
[09:36:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We need an image widget.
[09:36:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because I think popup will be used a lot for images
[09:37:39] <uGoMobi> and to display them nice on mobile and tablet/desktop you need to some scaling
[09:37:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We need an image widget.
[09:38:05] <uGoMobi> hmm
[09:38:09] <agcolom> yes, I've been working on an app at work, and I've used the popups for images!
[09:38:53] <uGoMobi> an image widget might be a good idea
[09:39:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The thing is, we need to draw the line somewhere - I mean, what if you put an image browser inside a popup: One image at the top, and a row of many small images at the bottom.
[09:39:13] <_|Nix|_> ?
[09:39:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What then?
[09:39:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This is why I'm saying it should be up to the app.
[09:39:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but we should give the app developer the hooks to decide about sizes.
[09:39:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I understand and I agree that we have to leave things up to the dev as much as possible
[09:40:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hence the "opening" event.
[09:40:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's take this up during the meeting tomorrow.
[09:40:53] <uGoMobi> but I think that making - whatever goes into the popup - fit the screen is a basic thing
[09:41:10] <agcolom> how about whatever you put in the popup always goes in a div. that div has a max-width and a max-height to avoid scrolling (or maybe this could be an optipon). ?
[09:41:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, good idea... lets discuss this with the others
[09:41:44] <agcolom> so you'd specify an option for scaling or use scroll?
[09:41:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, well that is indeed what I am suggesting
[09:41:58] <agcolom> data-scaling="true"
[09:42:13] <uGoMobi> it goes in a div (ui-popup) but I can't make that div fit the screen
[09:42:42] <uGoMobi> and I can't set padding because the container has class ui-body-x (bg + border)
[09:42:50] <agcolom> that div needs ot be smaller than the screen
[09:42:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I'd rather not do it with an option, because I don't know anything about the contents of a popup. It could be an image, it could be a form, it could be whatever.
[09:43:09] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: good point
[09:43:10] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's why I'd rather send out a signal before showing a popup.
[09:43:36] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The signal would give an opportunity to the app developer to set up scaling, sizing, rearranging, ellipsizing, whatever.
[09:44:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, like: "Warning! Warning! I'm about to appear on the screen! Last chance to calculate sizes!"
[09:44:21] <agcolom> ok, so how would you differentiate between a popup with fixed size image and popup with image that should scale?
[09:44:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I wouldn't. The app developer would hook up to this new signal and do the Right Thing™.
[09:45:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how about other way around, "sending out" the sizes?
[09:45:06] <agcolom> ok. So that would go in the docs then
[09:45:07] <uGoMobi> round*
[09:45:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, "around" is correct.
[09:45:39] <uGoMobi> haha oh ok thanks _|Nix|_
[09:45:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The sizes can be gotten easily enough: $( "#myPopup" ).width(), etc.
[09:45:53] <uGoMobi> I was never sure about that one (and many others ;-) )
[09:47:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: $( "#myPopup" ).bind( "opening", function() { if ( $( "#myPopup" ).height() > $( window ).height() ) {/* Do something to reduce the height */ } });
[09:47:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  yeah thats true
[09:47:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Something like that.
[09:47:46] <uGoMobi> and then I can adjust the height of the container?
[09:47:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: deploy?
[09:48:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You can adjust it before I do my calculations ...
[09:48:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: or the popup itself (ui-popup)?
[09:48:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[09:48:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then, you can do whatever you feel is necessary.
[09:49:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The point is that the code stops and waits for you to say OK before it opens.
[09:49:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I understand
[09:49:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but when I set the width/height of the container at that point, the framework does not override?
[09:50:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, that's wrong. It doesn't wait for you to say OK, because I'm not going to make opening a popup interruptible, but it does give you an opportunity to run your own code before it opens.
[09:51:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think so. It will still set max-width = window.width - tolerance, but that should be OK now.
[09:52:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'd basically trigger "opening" before calculating the x, y coordinates for the popup.
[09:53:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I understand, but I am thinking now what my script would look like
[09:53:09] <uGoMobi> let say I have an image
[09:53:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: do you kow if we're good to tag/deploy?
[09:53:41] <uGoMobi> johnbender: as far as I know yes
[09:53:51] <johnbender> awright
[09:54:14] <uGoMobi> johnbender: go for it
[09:54:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let say I have an image, I have to make the container same height/width as image
[09:55:20] <uGoMobi> so I first have to make my script get the image size before it is shown
[09:55:58] <uGoMobi> and then set the size for the container

[10:32:23] <MauriceG> agcolom: Hi Anne!   Can I ask a quick question?
[10:33:23] <chee> hey so
[10:33:41] <chee> here's an interesting thing and i'll make a test case for it for everyone to enjoy
[10:34:03] <chee> but you know the unified "tap" event that listens for clicks and touches
[10:34:51] <chee> if you are typing very fast on a bunch of <button>s, the click event still fires on an iphone when you touch the next button, and instead of that button being clicked the last button gets clicked again
[10:35:34] <toddparker> hi all
[10:35:37] <toddparker> internet is good
[10:36:00] <MauriceG> Hi toddparker
[10:36:13] <uGoMobi> hi toddparker
[10:37:15] <MauriceG> toddparker:  for the docs: is it a "list view" or a "listview" ?  It's very mixed ...
[10:37:47] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: ^^
[10:38:04] <MauriceG> agcolom: °°
[10:38:14] <MauriceG> ^^ *
[10:42:15] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I guess that when you are referring to the widget/component it is "listview"
[10:43:42] <MauriceG> most often it is called list view in the docs
[10:43:50] <MauriceG> the header also
[10:44:24] <uGoMobi> I don't think I am the right one to answer this :)
[10:44:38] <uGoMobi> I know in Dutch it is lijstweergave ;)
[10:45:17] <MauriceG> :-)
[10:46:08] <toddparker> hmmm
[10:46:23] <MauriceG> in the docs, the first paragraph at docs-lists.html starts with "list view" and ends with "listview" ...  The header calls List views ...
[10:46:24] <toddparker> i think we should probably standardize to the no space version
[10:47:01] <MauriceG> this is 70 - 30 %  (list view to listview) I guess ...
[10:47:24] <MauriceG> the items always called list item ...
[10:49:19] <toddparker> hmm
[10:49:34] <toddparker> agcolom: what's you opinion?
[10:52:02] <agcolom> Hi, I'm back
[10:52:11] <MauriceG> Hi agcolom !
[10:52:17] <agcolom> Hi!
[10:52:30] <MauriceG> ^^^
[10:53:02] <agcolom> Let me think...
[10:53:26] <MauriceG> agcolom: listview a kind of made-up word, right?
[10:53:46] <toddparker> kinda
[10:54:17] <toddparker> it's sort of a known component in UI frameworks
[10:54:18] <toddparker> https://www.google.com/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=listview
[10:54:21] <uGoMobi> I think listview without space is most clear
[10:54:41] <agcolom> I'm tempted to go for listview as it is also the data-role...
[10:54:43] <toddparker> android, windows, iOS, etc/
[10:54:44] <uGoMobi> because we use it as a name
[10:54:47] <toddparker> right
[10:54:57] <toddparker> that's what i was thinking agcolom
[10:55:14] <uGoMobi> on a rainy sunday afternoon we can even capitalize it ;)
[10:55:16] <agcolom> but then sometimes it may be legit to have list view
[10:56:02] <agcolom> it depends if we talk about a list view or the specific widget
[10:57:51] <agcolom> I can have a look in more detail when I come to do that widget for the api docs
[10:59:21] <MauriceG> agcolom: I just came up with this question cause it is very mixed in the docs
[10:59:47] <agcolom> ok, is it just in the list folder?
[11:00:04] <johnbender> toddparker: the code is up on the cdn
[11:00:11] <johnbender> just need to push the docs when you're ready
[11:01:50] <MauriceG> by the way: another name is "lists" eg  "Theming lists"
[11:02:21] <uGoMobi> MauriceG agcolom we have 364 x listview(s) and 38 x list view(s)
[11:02:28] <tbenzige> toddparker/everybody mind taking a look at http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller-test/ to test the 1.1.1 functionality?
[11:02:32] <uGoMobi> including links and all
[11:03:29] <MauriceG> yes, listview is of cause in the source code ...
[11:04:42] <MauriceG> it's an "built-in" so the name is listview, right?
[11:04:50] <MauriceG> a*
[11:04:52] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: everything seems to work fine. looks good!
[11:05:30] <agcolom> yes, I'd go for listview.
[11:05:57] <agcolom> (but MauriceG, if you want to make changes, could we have everything in 1 commit please :-) )
[11:06:30] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: <- have to make my repo fine first ! :-)
[11:06:50] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ask toddparker how long it can take to clone again ;)
[11:07:08] <MauriceG> :-)   I saw
[11:07:20] <agcolom> It would be a great time saving exercise for me, especially if I need to cherry pick ! ;-)
[11:07:46] <uGoMobi> if I need to do a search and replace just let me know
[11:08:37] <uGoMobi> it would be 38 changes so you can easily check that after the commit to see if there is a case where it shouldn't be replaced
[11:10:13] <uGoMobi> johnbender: green light already for cherry-picking into 1.1-stable for 1.1.2. ?
[11:12:42] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: are you seeing anything weird here? http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller-test/?ver=1.0.1
[11:12:43] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah, it's tagged
[11:13:24] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: is it correct that you ask me to look at 1.0.1. ?
[11:13:48] <tbenzige> yeah
[11:13:53] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: aha ... I see a btoken checkbox
[11:13:57] <uGoMobi> broken even
[11:13:57] <tbenzige> yeah me too
[11:14:05] <tbenzige> but i can't replicate on local
[11:14:30] <uGoMobi> let me inspect the code
[11:15:10] <agcolom> id is 1 label is a
[11:15:13] <agcolom> checkbox
[11:15:23] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: I see the cause
[11:15:34] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: the input and the label have different ID's
[11:16:10] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: hah ok
[11:16:12] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: input id="checkbox-a" label for="checkbox-1"
[11:16:12] <tbenzige> good catch!
[11:17:06] <uGoMobi> actually I switched the ID's but problem is the same
[11:18:15] <tbenzige> ok cool. fixing now...
[11:18:23] <uGoMobi> ok great!
[11:19:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: did you get my message about the popup tests breaking?
[11:21:14] <toddparker> so it looks like we're good to go on 1.1.1?
[11:21:26] <johnbender> yap
[11:21:31] <toddparker> i can push the blog post later today or first thing tomorrow
[11:21:40] <toddparker> tomorrow might be better for impact on the twitterverse
[11:21:58] <toddparker> i can do it first thing in the morning
[11:22:02] <johnbender> toddparker: do you want to wait on the demos update too?
[11:22:07] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I saw that _|Nix|_ replied around 11 hours ago
[11:22:27] <toddparker> johnbender: do you mean /demos/
[11:22:39] <johnbender> toddparker: yes
[11:22:41] <johnbender> uGoMobi: checking
[11:23:18] <johnbender> hmm I don't see anything in the logs
[11:24:04] <uGoMobi> 09:38 <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender I can't reproduce that with firefox ...
[11:24:04] <uGoMobi> 09:38 <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender I tried with this URL: http://localhost/nix/jqm/jquery-mobile/tests/unit/popup/?_=1341950437173&swarmURL=http://swarm.jquery.org/index.php?status=2&run_id=4228&client_id=5612&run_token=61958de2f054136c24650b27549760494ac4398c&results_id=49420&results_store_token=3f4cf9a7ab712eb96a22afede
[11:24:04] <uGoMobi> 09:39 <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender whereas I normally run http://localhost/nix/jqm/jquery-mobile/tests/unit/popup/
[11:24:25] <uGoMobi> i think he forgot the q-mark
[11:26:30] <toddparker> johnbender: do you think you could generate the list of contributors for the 1.1.1 release based on scott's gist?
[11:27:24] <toddparker> johnbender: I think it would be ok to push up http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/
[11:29:50] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I added the photos for popup to the docs
[11:30:57] <uGoMobi> toddparker: _|Nix|_ already made some changes so it's better already, but I still can't make images fit the screen with CSS (only works on webkit browsers now)
[11:32:14] <uGoMobi>  _|Nix|_ suggested to discuss this during tomorrow's call
[11:32:19] <uGoMobi> I say +1
[11:36:27] <toddparker> thanks uGoMobi
[11:37:59] <toddparker> hopping into a meeting for a bit but the blog is ready to go
[11:38:07] <toddparker> i'll check in on popup when i

[12:06:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: one sec
[12:06:27] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[12:07:30] <johnbender> toddparker: on master you can do `bash build/bin/contrib.sh 1.1.0-1.1.1 to get a list of contribs
[12:07:34] <johnbender> oops
[12:07:47] <johnbender> `bash build/bin/contrib.sh 1.1.0 1.1.1`
[12:07:58] <johnbender> you can use the tags for any version you like
[12:08:13] <johnbender> I stripped out most of the other stuff from the UI version since we dont care about svn
[12:11:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can we cherry-pick onto 1.1-stable now?
[12:11:32] <_|Nix|_> ... that the tag is out 'n about?
[12:14:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah
[12:14:30] <MauriceG> ?tell uGoMobi sorry Jasper, one question: If I set $.mobile.listview.prototype.options.splitIcon = "star"; in mobileinit, should not all split icons default to "star" then ?
[12:14:31] <bot-t> MauriceG, Okay.
[12:15:01] <MauriceG> oh, uGoMobi   you're back?
[12:15:26] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yeah for one minute, dinner is almost ready
[12:15:27] <bot-t> (56 secs ago) <MauriceG> tell uGoMobi sorry Jasper, one question: If I set $.mobile.listview.prototype.options.splitIcon = "star"; in mobileinit, should not all split icons default to "star" then ?
[12:15:43] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: the answer is no
[12:16:04] <uGoMobi> the data-attr should override it
[12:16:23] <MauriceG> moment.  if no attribute is there ?
[12:16:48] <MauriceG> I mean the default should be overridden then
[12:19:01] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: in general.... $.mobile.listview.prototype.options.splitIcon sets the default for all listviews
[12:19:14] <MauriceG> but it does not work ...
[12:19:31] <uGoMobi> this can be overriden by .listview({spliticon:grid})
[12:19:44] <uGoMobi> and by data-spliticon
[12:20:13] <uGoMobi> last two are for a specific listview element
[12:20:28] <MauriceG> if I set $.mobile.listview.prototype.options.splitIcon = "star"; and do not use any data-attribute at all, the default is still arrow-r
[12:20:59] <uGoMobi> hmm thats a bug then
[12:21:11] <uGoMobi> you should be able to set options that way
[12:21:56] <uGoMobi> going to have dinner now, will take a look at listview code later
[12:22:13] <MauriceG> and...$.mobile.listview.prototype.options.dividerTheme and $.mobile.listview.prototype.options.theme do not work also... but I will test further ...
[12:22:31] <MauriceG> sorry and thank you !!  Enjoy your dinner!!

[12:23:26] <johnbender> kk
[12:23:30] <johnbender> that should be sorted
[12:23:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you had some questions about nav?
[12:25:46] <jzaefferer> johnbender: about that QUnit update - will you do that?
[12:25:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah.
[12:25:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: In Android 2.3.5 popup doesn't work.
[12:26:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I don't get a hashchange when the user hits "Back".
[12:26:24] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #313: STILL FAILING in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/313/
[12:26:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: in all cases?
[12:26:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, _handleHashChange gets called by hand from onPopState, so it works as expected everywhere else.
[12:26:31] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah
[12:27:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the history api is working but hashchange isn't in that case
[12:27:12] <johnbender> ?
[12:27:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It works fine when I turn off pushState.
[12:27:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah. urlHistory is kept correctly because _handleHashChange is called by hand from pushState.
[12:29:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: are you saying that when you bind to hashchange you don't get the event or are you hookin in somewhere else
[12:30:16] <johnbender> we dont do anything to prevent hashchange from firing
[12:30:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm not getting the event.
[12:31:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I guess using the history api disables the hashchange event then?
[12:31:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it would be interesting to know if that's the case outside of jqm
[12:32:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... with just jquery.hashchange.js?
[12:32:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: just the browser api
[12:33:01] <johnbender> I think 2.3.5 supports hashchange natively
[12:33:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can test.
[12:33:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: otherwise it seems like you'll have to bind to popstate too
[12:33:42] <johnbender> and do something similar to what's in the pushstate plugin
[12:34:00] <johnbender> in which case we might wnat to make that kind of generic if it doesn't add too much complexity
[12:34:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: in the short term I would just hack somethign together to see if it solves the issue and then we can address making it pretty/DRY
[12:35:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was thinking that maybe we should trigger some signal related in name to hashchange ...

[12:48:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can we use namespaced events, like hashchange.jqm?
[12:49:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right but that's semantically equivelant to hashchange
[12:49:27] <johnbender> which would be confusing
[12:49:32] <johnbender> synthhashchange
[12:49:35] <johnbender> or some such
[12:49:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah ... I guess the name has to be different ...
[12:50:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: BTW: I'm getting working hashchange with a super-simple document, with and without jqm - so the problem might be elsewhere.
[12:50:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Might be that I'm attaching on-demand. Like $( window ).one( "hashchange", ... and only when I need to.
[12:51:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... whereas the other hashchange handlers are attaching at init.
[12:51:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: what version of firefox did you test the popups with that long query string

[13:18:05] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1d, 1h ago): Docs: Replace scheme with theme (popup/options.html)
[13:18:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It seems that hashchange stops working after AJAXing in a page.
[13:18:35] <johnbender> :(
[13:18:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I made two pages hashchange.html and hashchange1.html
[13:19:08] <agcolom> its not it's in my above question!!! (ah shame on me!!!!)
[13:19:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I put a popup on each.
[13:19:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Works fine on the first page, but won't dismiss on the second because it doesn't get the hashchange.
[13:19:53] * agcolom is going to hide in a cave!
[13:19:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll add a hashchange listener on the first page to see if it fires ...
[13:21:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ok
[13:21:24] <johnbender> so I can reproduce the test failures

[13:22:51] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://gist.github.com/b8ed17eb4d808458367e

[13:23:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ...
[13:38:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Maybe there is no hashchange with pushState turned on, because the hash really did not change. I mean, I'm going from page2.html to page1.html when I hit "Back", so the hash went from empty to empty. The fact that page1.html and page2.html were cosmetically fixed URLs which did originally have different hashes (namely page.html#/path/to/page1.html resp. page.html#/path/to/page2.html) doesn't seem to be making a difference.
[13:41:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that was the original assumption under which I made a change to pushstate that broke it in relatively subtle ways on android
[13:42:06] <johnbender> I thought I could check the hash to see if it would be different
[13:42:09] <johnbender> but I was wrong
[13:42:13] <johnbender> it's random in many cases
[13:42:39] <johnbender> if the navigation through replaced states changes the url to something with a hash it may or may not have a hashchange
[13:42:44] <johnbender> there aren't any guarantees at this point
[13:42:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Egads!
[13:43:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What I have found is that if you go back after the first AJAX event, you get the hashchange, but if you go page.html -> page1.html -> page2.html and then back, back, you get no hashchanges.
[13:43:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Rigorous, eh?
[13:44:07] <johnbender> :D
[13:44:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I guess I'll have to go with the synthhashchange hack, or something.
[13:44:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: why don't you trigger a "navigate" event
[13:44:46] <johnbender> on the page container
[13:45:00] <johnbender> that seems to capture both
[13:45:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What do you mean? Trigger from where? Capture both what?
[13:46:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: _handleHashChange, maybe trigger at the top and check for return false
[13:46:25] <johnbender> as a hook into that
[13:46:32] <johnbender> not sure if that solves your issue
[13:47:02] * johnbender watches as the navigation model gets ever more complex/convoluted
[13:47:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, actually, in this case, the complex/convoluted navigation model promises to make the hashchange on Android 2.3.5 more robust.
[13:48:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... assuming "navigate" works out.
[13:48:11] <johnbender> yar
[13:50:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: One thing nags me though: Shouldn't we put _handleHashChange on equal footing by binding to this new "navigate" thing and triggering "navigate" from the same two places that currently call _handleHashChange?
[13:50:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we could but I'd rather not monkey with it for now
[13:51:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[13:51:05] <johnbender> nav is fragile
[13:52:04] <_|Nix|_> Alright. I'll trigger navigate from _handleHashChange then - I'll put a comment in there about this so we don't forget.
[13:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: Got a few minutes for a call?
[13:53:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: One more thing: Not sure what you meant by "check for return false".
[13:54:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Did you mean to exit _handleHashChange early if someone does a preventDefault() on the "navigate" event?
[13:54:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: correct
[13:54:44] <johnbender> I wasn't sure if you needed that
[13:54:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Alright.
[13:56:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Actually, that might be interesting in terms of using that instead of ignoreNextHashChange ...
[13:57:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It'd slightly reduce the amount of nav code inside popup.
[13:57:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I think toddparker is in a meeting at the moment...
[13:58:15] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks agcolom
[13:58:47] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: but he should come back here afterwards...
[13:59:24] <scott_gonzalez> I might be gone by then :-P I'll ping him tomorrow if I'm gone by the time he gets back.
[14:00:55] <agcolom> ok :-)
[14:06:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, slap me around and call me Suzy! "navigate" makes things work in Android 2.3.5 :)
[14:06:56] <johnbender> cool
[14:09:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: BTW: What's the official way to locally run /all/ the unit tests before pushing something to master?
[14:10:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: node and phantom
[14:10:52] <johnbender> I removed the runner page
[14:11:03] <johnbender> details on that are in the README
[14:11:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah - seeing that now ... I remember you doing something like that.
[14:13:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What is $WEB_SERVER?
[14:13:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: localy hosted version of the tests
[14:13:45] <johnbender> we rely on php
[14:14:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, so basically localhost/path/to/jquery-mobile/
[14:14:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Right?
[14:14:43] <johnbender> correct
[14:14:47] <johnbender> I need to clarify that
[14:14:49] <johnbender> one sec
[14:15:19] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I don't see the issue with listview options not working ... http://jsbin.com/isitep/2/
[14:15:19] <bot-t> (1 hour 37 mins ago) <MauriceG> tell uGoMobi If I set $.mobile.listview.prototype.options.splitIcon on mobileinit, it gets overridden to arrow-r. If I set it on pagebeforecreate it works. Do I miss something?
[14:16:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: D0000d! This ran quickly ... in, like, no time ... not sure I did it right.
[14:17:43] <johnbender> it takes like 5 or 6 minutes to run the whole suite
[14:18:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, so I did /something/ wrong ...

[14:20:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... while doing kitchensink ...
[14:20:26] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: ?
[14:20:31] <johnbender> hrm
[14:20:43] <johnbender> but it was running the other tests ok?
[14:21:00] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: I intended it as an onomatopoeic interjection to express my frustration.
[14:21:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, it started with kitchensink.
[14:21:59] <gnarf> fair
[14:22:57] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: I was debating whether I should use "ph" at the end, but that doesn't lend itself well to repetition :)
[14:24:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and you're on master?
[14:24:07] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[14:24:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: what version of phantom are you running?
[14:24:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: 1.5.0
[14:24:44] <johnbender> hrm
[14:25:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: tests/unit/xxx runs fine in Chrome.
[14:25:15] <johnbender> yah
[14:25:26] <johnbender> as does the phantom build on jenkins
[14:26:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I can try targeting individual tests with TEST_PATH to see if they all give me the same result.
[14:26:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: sure
[14:27:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Does it give any progress after "Testing navigation/"?
[14:27:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Same failure for nav.
[14:28:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah it works fine locally
[14:28:16] <johnbender> err that works fine here
[14:28:23] <johnbender> hmm
[14:28:27] <johnbender> I just got a timeout for loader too
[14:28:31] <johnbender> checking something
[14:28:33] <_|Nix|_> Dunno what I'm doing wrong ...
[14:31:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ok
[14:31:38] <johnbender> I know what the problem is
[14:31:48] <johnbender> just need to figure out how to fix it :(
[14:32:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: for now just go ahead and push the changes
[14:35:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can you drop this at the bottom of external/qunit.js to see if it sorts out your issue

[14:41:40] <johnbender> yar that should work
[14:42:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I wish it did.
[14:43:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no dice eh?
[14:43:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Anyway, I'm going to push the "navigate" thing because the tests did work in the browser.

[15:02:22] <johnbender> 1746b3518d0674c101939a3b2f83e20b1c4852ca appears to have broken checkboxradio in the phantom test
[15:02:26] <johnbender> *tests
[15:02:29] <johnbender> I'm looking into it now
[15:04:57] <johnbender> uGoMobi: also reproducible in chrome
[15:08:19] <uGoMobi> johnbender: how come I don't see anymore which test failed when I look on Jenkins?
[15:11:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: the failure stops the tests all together which ruins the xml output
[15:11:14] <johnbender> something that needs to be addressed :(
[15:11:45] <johnbender> and the console output is useless for the mostpart because of the way that grunt parses the test url :(
[15:12:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: until that stuff improves I'll just have to keep an eye on it
[15:13:08] <toddparker> johnbender: we use screen flow on mac
[15:13:08] <bot-t> (1 hour 55 mins ago) <agcolom> tell toddparker : I need your advice on this one, and it's 11 twin sisters and brothers: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4678 (see my comment at the bottom). Thank you :)

[15:13:40] <johnbender> toddparker: cool there's also soundstage which is 5 dollars
[15:15:37] <toddparker> better
[15:15:51] <toddparker> sorry, need to head out
[15:16:02] <toddparker> i'll be on tomorrow mid morning everyone
[15:18:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I see multiple test failed... some might be matter of adjusting the test, but others not :(
[15:19:57] <uGoMobi> I really hate this because the commit adds a useless feature if you ask me
[15:20:17] <johnbender> uGoMobi: there's nothing to say we have to add it
[15:20:30] <johnbender> if it there's no point revert and move on
[15:20:45] <johnbender> just make sure to talk with Maurice once you do
[15:20:50] <johnbender> if you do
[15:21:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: it was not MauriceG his idea to add it, he just create a PR for someone else his feature request
[15:22:18] <uGoMobi> and I tested it and didn't see a problem
[15:23:08] <uGoMobi> johnbender: but you are right I have to inform him why I am going to revert it for now

[15:46:40] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #317: STILL FAILING in 18 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/317/
[15:59:36] <uGoMobi> johnbender: master is still failing, but that has to do with popup/navigation stuff you and _|Nix|_ were discussing, right?
[16:00:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: nope, we were working on the testswarm build
[16:00:16] <uGoMobi> ohw :(
[16:00:46] <johnbender> uGoMobi: the revert hasn't been tested yet
[16:01:08] <johnbender> that last build only got the navigate stuff that _|Nix|_ pushed
[16:01:13] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ah of course, see it now too
[16:01:43] <uGoMobi> obviously getting too late for me so I am going to sleep ;)
[16:02:22] <uGoMobi> good night all!
[16:02:26] <MauriceG> johnbender:
[16:02:39] <MauriceG> sorry and thanks!
[16:02:46] <johnbender> MauriceG: ah, no worries
[16:02:56] <johnbender> the test build is for breaking
[16:03:07] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: good night! !
[16:03:16] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: thanks!
[16:03:46] <MauriceG> will jump to bed also soon !
[16:03:58] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: good night to you too!
[16:04:16] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: before I go... just to be clear...
[16:04:32] <uGoMobi> not a problem that test breaks
[16:04:42] <MauriceG> See you tomorrow!  Found my fault with lists in my fiddle. The "overloading" was ...
[16:05:02] <uGoMobi> so nothing to be sorry about... I have to learn always run local test first and not to use the green button on Github
[16:05:36] <uGoMobi> I just still think it's a useless feature :D  haha
[16:05:37] <MauriceG> I was scared when I saw this here :-(
[16:05:52] <uGoMobi> ok cool that spliticon works
[16:06:18] <MauriceG> yes, the most useless PR ...  and I was :-(
[16:06:34] <uGoMobi> hahaha
[16:07:02] <uGoMobi> well if we make people happy with it, it's not useless
[16:07:13] <uGoMobi> but at the moment I forgot about that ;)
[16:07:51] <uGoMobi> I am going to dream about links in labels now :D
[16:07:59] <uGoMobi> in other words... I am off to bed
[16:08:15] <uGoMobi> good night all!
[16:09:06] <MauriceG> Good Night Jasper!
