[04:20:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong!
[04:43:47] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15mani4689 opened issue #5338: scrolling is not working in web os  02http://git.io/2_9oeg
[04:44:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[04:44:42] * _|Nix|_ is grabbing issue numbers :)
[04:44:49] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[04:45:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4956 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5223 ...
[04:45:18] <_|Nix|_> THe listview grid stuff ...
[04:45:28] <_|Nix|_> the PR is for the old docs, not the new demmos.
[04:45:35] <_|Nix|_> Should we close the PR?
[04:45:56] <_|Nix|_> ... or should we ask that it be re-written against the new demos?
[04:46:14] <_|Nix|_> ... or did you make a demo for that yourself, as part of the demos effort?
[04:47:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: at the last meeting keith and toddmparker said we were going to discuss the listview grid later
[04:47:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we didn't do that yet
[04:47:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it won't be a problem to use that PR for new demos
[04:48:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, cool. So, the two are up for discussion. Got it.
[04:48:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just have to look into it to see if it's the right approach
[04:48:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[04:48:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I wasn't very active last couple of days because I was sick, but better now
[04:49:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so I will pick this up
[04:50:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: will try to review the PR before tomorrow's meeting and bring it up, so we can decide what to do with the PR
[04:50:11] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[04:50:11] <bot-t1> (5 hours 54 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell arschmitz Since you've recently looked at swipe events, do you think you could have a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5035? It seems we don't properly clean up after unbinding swipe event handlers after they're removed.
[04:50:22] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz good morning
[04:50:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good to hear your feeling better
[04:50:44] <uGoMobi> thanks
[04:51:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome, and good to hear ...
[04:51:19] <uGoMobi> I really hate it when there are so many things I want to do but 0 energy :(
[04:51:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im looking at 5025 now
[04:52:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm certain you meant https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5035 ... cool!
[04:52:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup :) 
[04:52:58] <_|Nix|_> I think I'm going to switch to Fedora 18 Beta ... I've been running FF 12 for long enough ...
[04:53:19] <_|Nix|_> ... and I can't wait to have my old-fashioned GNOME desktop back ... 
[04:53:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nice
[04:53:34] * _|Nix|_ hopes these are not famous last words.
[05:05:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im having _destroy dejavu lol we have no teardown method on the event so unbind dosent unbind any of the events that were bound internally
[05:06:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: actually none of our custom touch events do
[05:15:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i just commented on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5149 i think we should just close it personally (maybe a note in the docs)
[05:46:41] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15metteo opened issue #5339: Clicking select menu on Android breaks OpenLayers  02http://git.io/ZF_I3Q
[08:00:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you here?
[08:01:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[08:02:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: mind taking a quick look at http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/range.html added split styles and changed formating a bit
[08:02:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if you like it ill push it to the branch
[08:03:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah the custom theme
[08:03:51] <uGoMobi> wasn't sure what you meant by split styles
[08:04:09] <uGoMobi> see split full  now
[08:05:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that looks good
[08:05:01] <arschmitz> yeah the split styles just put the inputs at both ends
[08:05:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we have to see what we do below 28em width
[08:05:30] <arschmitz> its in there just shrink your screen
[08:06:12] <uGoMobi> yes I see
[08:06:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: below 28 em the slider is always on its own like and inputs with the label
[08:06:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but the slider is not full width
[08:07:34] <arschmitz> it should be maybe i broke it when i changed something ill look again
[08:08:13] <arschmitz> oh i see i broke the input style below 28em though with the dash ill fix that
[08:08:15] <uGoMobi> I was looking at split full and split mini full
[08:08:23] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:09:22] <arschmitz> weird i see those full width
[08:09:25] <arschmitz> in chrome
[08:09:29] <arschmitz> and on iphone
[08:10:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when I shrink window width on Chrome the slider isn't full width
[08:11:54] <arschmitz> is it just the 15px padding from the list?
[08:12:48] <uGoMobi> no
[08:13:07] <uGoMobi> split and split mini are full width, split full and split mini full aren't
[08:13:39] <uGoMobi> look at the last 4 examples on that page
[08:14:01] <arschmitz> oh i see it on the left its a bit shorter
[08:14:27] <arschmitz> missed overriding a style
[08:14:46] <uGoMobi> actually both sides, the slider is centered
[08:15:37] <uGoMobi> ah sorry, you are right.. more space on the left
[08:18:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: can you look now should be fixed
[08:18:19] <uGoMobi> sure
[08:18:46] <arschmitz> there are some other little alignment things i still need to fix but overall should be good
[08:19:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes fixed now :)
[08:19:45] <uGoMobi> I see we also have to look at top/bottom padding in fieldcontain
[08:20:39] <arschmitz> yes i havent dealt with fieldcontain with the new css yet
[08:21:05] <arschmitz> i think this makes the range more usable though it takes essentially all the remaining avalible room on screen 
[08:21:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, this is what i had in mind too
[08:22:06] <uGoMobi> fieldcontain is different thing, I am looking into that
[08:22:44] <arschmitz> yeah i had it before but now i have to redo all my fieldcontaiin css for the range
[08:23:50] <arschmitz> with having 2 handles on the slider having it as wide as possible i think is importanr
[08:24:12] <uGoMobi> yes for usablity
[08:24:19] <arschmitz> exactly
[08:24:40] <uGoMobi> that's why i wanted to make regular slider full width too in combination with number input
[08:24:57] <arschmitz> yeah should be easy with this approach
[08:25:11] <arschmitz> just float everything left execpt the slider
[08:25:31] <arschmitz> and do overflow:hidden on the slider and adjust accordingly
[08:26:10] <arschmitz> will make all the range / sliders line up nice on the left like other inputs too
[08:26:21] <arschmitz> be real pretty :) lol
[08:26:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the float explains the lack of top/bottom padding in the fieldcontain
[08:26:52] <arschmitz> yes
[08:26:54] <uGoMobi> we have to use a clearfix
[08:26:58] <arschmitz> yup
[08:27:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: like i said havent tackled field contain yet
[08:27:41] <uGoMobi> that was also the issue with the regular slider... there is currently no wrapping div to set the clearfix on
[08:28:11] <arschmitz> with range its easy becasue it has a wrapper
[08:28:19] <uGoMobi> yeah
[08:29:11] <uGoMobi> so that's what we need to add for slider widget but without adding break chance
[08:29:38] <arschmitz> if we do it in 1.4 we dont have to worry about a break as much
[08:29:58] <arschmitz> we could add range for 1.3 and then harmonize slider with it for 1.4
[08:35:33] <uGoMobi> gseguin: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
[08:36:07] <gseguin> Thanks uGoMobi!
[08:36:46] <arschmitz> gseguin: Happy Birthday from me too! :)
[08:37:04] <gseguin> thank you!
[09:21:17] <johnbender> gseguin: ryanneufeld: gnarf: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4843508
[09:21:37] <johnbender> Mitch is launching a company to support Vagrant
[09:21:49] <ryanneufeld> nice
[09:22:33] <ryanneufeld> so it will remain open, and you can buy optional support?
[09:22:47] <ryanneufeld> funny story about vagrant
[09:23:02] <ryanneufeld> CBSi recent rolled out something called "project highlander"
[09:23:07] <ryanneufeld> a in house CMS
[09:23:17] <ryanneufeld> the guy in charge was telling my boss about it
[09:23:19] <gseguin> Nice johnbender
[09:23:35] <ryanneufeld> and they're like "All our devs use vagrant vms and puppet for configuration of them"
[09:23:53] <ryanneufeld> and he was like "Yeah, we've been doing that for a while, email this guy: <my email>"
[09:27:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ping!
[09:27:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Hi
[09:28:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you open this on your iPhone http://jsbin.com/uzaret/551
[09:28:31] <uGoMobi> does it zoom when you click the select?
[09:29:17] <arschmitz> nope
[09:30:00] <uGoMobi> that's what I thought
[09:30:09] <arschmitz> iv seen that before on ios where it zooms on a select
[09:30:20] <arschmitz> just recently
[09:30:24] <uGoMobi> iPhone 4 or 4S, iOS6?
[09:30:37] <arschmitz> iphone 4 ios5
[09:30:48] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:31:28] <arschmitz> whats the issue # because i swear i looked at this in the last few weeks and was able to reproduce
[09:31:42] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5333
[09:33:10] <arschmitz> yeah i cant reproduce any more so i think we are good
[09:33:57] <uGoMobi> think so too
[09:34:01] <uGoMobi> thanks for testing
[09:34:07] <uGoMobi> I'll comment and close
[09:36:48] <arschmitz> along these same lines https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3690
[09:37:14] <arschmitz> on this one i can reproduce but ONLY on a mini text input not regular
[09:38:34] <uGoMobi> interesting
[09:39:37] <arschmitz> very
[09:40:08] <arschmitz> like on the page in the docs they refrence only the 2nd input on the page does it the mini one
[09:40:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: whats your oppinion on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5149
[09:42:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if anything i think maybe we should look at removing the active state on the second tap
[09:50:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am not sure if we should do anything about it either
[09:51:23] <arschmitz> if we could remove active state it would be less missleading to endusers
[09:52:04] <uGoMobi> yeah so I think we should look into this together with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5009
[09:52:35] <arschmitz> yeah because 5009 dosent have enough to think about already ! ha ha 
[09:52:45] <toddmparker> hey all
[09:52:53] <arschmitz> but yes its very much a part of 5009. 
[09:52:55] <uGoMobi> haha well better address all at once
[09:52:57] <toddmparker> was out this morning. 
[09:53:02] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker 
[09:53:02] <toddmparker> catching up
[09:53:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker: slacker
[09:53:30] <toddmparker> I have a jQuery tech lead call in a few. any questions or updates I should bubble up to core/ui/infra?
[09:53:39] <toddmparker> i am a slacker. it's true
[09:54:11] <toddmparker> btw - jlembeck is working full time on the panel plugin in a branch and it should be in good shape today/tomorrow
[09:54:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: one infra Q / remark... all branch previews are preserved, even from removed branches
[09:59:44] <arschmitz> toddmparker: if you have a sec before you go https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5149
[10:00:30] <Wilto> Checkin’ in. What’s new, guys?
[10:01:19] <arschmitz> Wilto: Both nothing and everything its very exastential 
[10:01:51] <Wilto> *Deep*.
[10:02:13] <toddmparker> have we updated to 1.8.3 in the docs yet?
[10:02:21] <toddmparker> thought we had, can't remember
[10:02:44] <arschmitz> 1.8.2
[10:04:14] <toddmparker> arschmitz: you have a minute to update that?
[10:05:08] <toddmparker> anything in core git currently breaking _|Nix|_ or uGoMobi or arschmitz or johnbender 
[10:05:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know had something yesterday but i think it got fixed
[10:07:05] <uGoMobi> the build is ok now
[10:12:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: updated to 1.8.3
[10:13:37] <uGoMobi> dinner time... will be back later
[10:25:05] <ryanneufeld> what could cause a swipe event to be thrown 3x?
[10:25:13] <ryanneufeld> like, it's consistently 3x
[10:34:09] <arschmitz> swipe is triggered on cords not an element
[10:34:38] <arschmitz> so it can be triggered multiple times from a single swipe
[10:35:23] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: ^^
[10:35:41] <ryanneufeld> I found the problem
[10:35:45] <ryanneufeld> I was binding on page init
[10:35:46] <ryanneufeld> to body
[10:36:02] <ryanneufeld> and it was getting bound several times because I have data-prefetch enabled on our nav
[10:36:05] <ryanneufeld> I think I have a solution though
[10:36:11] <toddmparker> arschmitz - re:5149, seems like it's not fixable
[10:36:18] <toddmparker> or worth messing with
[10:36:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah we could make a work around but i dont think we should since its exoected native behivor
[10:36:56] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: nope, darn it.
[10:36:58] <arschmitz> expected
[10:38:49] <arschmitz> toddmparker: though i think as part of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5009 i think we should lookinto removing active state on double tap so its not misleading
[10:40:10] <ryanneufeld> I noticed an empty object being passed as a second param to the pageinit callback. Is that normal?
[10:43:06] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: if your binding to body why are you doing it on pageinit? do you only want it to be bound for a specific page?
[10:43:19] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: yeah, I changed to to e.target
[10:43:49] <ryanneufeld> https://gist.github.com/872e2460891a9b71677c arschmitz
[10:44:24] <ryanneufeld> I want to enable swipe gestures for pagination
[10:44:36] <arschmitz> ah i see what you have there looks ok now
[10:44:56] <arschmitz> ryaneufeld: caution though on ios scrolling will cause i swipe!
[10:45:26] <ryanneufeld> right/left?
[10:45:46] <ryanneufeld> none of our content scrolls, it all scales
[10:45:47] <arschmitz> yup if your finger drifts to right or left surring scroll it will cause a right left swipe on ios
[10:45:57] <arschmitz> ok you should be good then
[10:46:14] <ryanneufeld> the problem I have now
[10:46:20] <ryanneufeld> is that when I go to the next page
[10:46:24] <ryanneufeld> I get more than one event firing
[10:47:11] <arschmitz> i think thats because of the triggering on cords i mentioned before do this instead
[10:47:20] <arschmitz> bind on page show
[10:47:26] <arschmitz> unbind on pagehide
[10:47:56] <ryanneufeld> hmm. moving it in to my global pageinit seems to do it.
[10:47:57] <arschmitz> then you only have 1 bound swipe at any given time
[10:48:02] <ryanneufeld> is bind/unbind the way to go?
[10:49:11] <arschmitz> if moving it to your global one works you can just do that but bind unbind just gurantees no weird ness since then you only have one bound event at any given time 
[10:51:06] <arschmitz> oh execpt unbind on swipe dosent work right now :(
[10:52:00] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: though it would probably still work for you it wont trigger the event but still handles it because swipe is missing the teardown method
[10:52:41] <ryanneufeld> This seems to work fine, as I can find the pagination links in the current doc, and then call .click()
[10:52:43] <ryanneufeld> which is nice
[10:53:27] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: cool because like i mentiond unbinding swipe is broken right now
[10:53:32] <ryanneufeld> nice
[10:54:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5035 i was looking at this and the cause is that we are missing the teardown method on all of our custom touch events
[10:55:53] <arschmitz> toddmparker: this means anything we bind internally in these events is never unbound
[11:09:42] <toddmparker> i see
[11:10:00] <toddmparker> sort of like how we need destroy on widgets
[11:10:11] <toddmparker> flag to 1.4?
[11:11:38] <arschmitz> exactly! sounds good ill do it
[11:17:29] <toddmparker> cool
[11:17:46] <toddmparker> i'm heading to a 2-3 hour workshop so i'll be off for a bit
[12:17:12] <Wilto> ryanneufeld: You pickin’ fights in here again?
[12:17:40] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: nope, I've seen you punch, I wouldn't want to face your right cross
[12:17:54] <Wilto> It’s good to be known for something.
[12:17:57] <Wilto> (Violence.)
[12:27:58] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[12:32:49] <arschmitz> hi _|Nix|_:
[12:34:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: since your here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5149 the general consensus seems to be close wont fix. but try and address removing the highlight on double tap
[12:35:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ as part of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5009
[12:35:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[12:36:11] <_|Nix|_> I don't think we can remove it though, unless we go with a timeout or a CSS transition.
[12:36:49] <arschmitz> yeah i dont think thats criticly important. would just be better feed back for the user if we could figure it out
[12:38:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: could make a new event doubletap lol
[12:42:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. It's closed, and I've made a reference to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5009 ...
[12:42:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So we're doing the event teardown for 1.4?
[12:42:49] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5035 i commented as to the real cause and set a 1.4 milestone
[12:42:55] <arschmitz> lol timing yup
[12:43:00] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[12:43:10] <arschmitz> im going to close the pr attached
[12:46:00] <arschmitz> 1.4 continues to grow!
[12:46:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Might as well call it 2.0 ... *shrug*
[12:46:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We'll be re-writing so much ...
[12:46:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|: pretty much
[12:46:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, 100% behind-the-scenes, 0% new features.
[12:46:49] <arschmitz> kind of ironic considdering jQuery 1.4
[12:47:02] <arschmitz> that was their major rewrite
[12:48:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not ironic, I would say ... foreboding perhaps, or mystifying ...
[12:48:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it will be a lot of behind the scenes stuff but it will make the library MUCH better and more consistant as a whole
[12:48:25] <_|Nix|_> May you speak nothing but truth.
[12:48:37] <arschmitz> lets hope anyway
[12:49:24] <_|Nix|_> Actually, if we break any major API, we're probably better off calling it 2.0 ...
[12:49:41] <_|Nix|_> ... though I doubt it'll go that far ...
[12:49:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats true hopefully i dont think it will be anything too major though
[12:50:07] <arschmitz> as far as breaking changes
[12:50:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ a lot of stuff that could potentially break edge cases though
[12:51:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: this could be an issue in sticking to our quartly releases though lol this is going to be a big one could take a little longer
[12:52:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: toddmparker did say he still wants to get tabs in there for 1.4 
[12:53:00] <_|Nix|_> Time to start stockpiling oil for all those midnights to burn on.
[12:54:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but i already work untill midnight every night :(
[12:54:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Me too, pretty much, although I'm trying to cut back ... for example, it's 22:54 here, and I'm looking to take off pretty soon ... 
[12:54:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Ping!
[12:56:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:Yeah im on here from like 6 - mindnight on average!
[13:05:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: pong
[13:06:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Does your refactor touch much south of _registerInternalEvents?
[13:06:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: not really
[13:06:51] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it only touches a couple places
[13:06:54] <johnbender> if you need to do it
[13:06:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I have a PR that makes the instant feedback of ui-btn-active work for forms that are handled via AJAX.
[13:06:55] <johnbender> do it
[13:07:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't mess around in the click handlers
[13:07:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. Great!
[13:07:23] <johnbender> its' mostly the hashchange handler and in changpage a couple of places
[13:07:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Excellent! Then I can merge that PR without causing you any headache.
[13:08:39] <_|Nix|_> OK, on that cheery note, I think I'll sign off for the day. L8R all!
[13:31:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5333#issuecomment-10817548
[13:32:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sounds related to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3690
[13:32:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats the one thats only on mini in latest it seems
[13:33:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so we should see if we can figure out the difference when its mini
[13:34:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you mean 3690 is fixed, but only not for mini sized inputs?
[13:35:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[13:37:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i just got it to happen once with a select after an orientation change
[13:37:58] <arschmitz> but cant get it to happen again
[13:38:03] <uGoMobi> hmm
[13:39:04] <arschmitz> just on the select page in the docs
[13:42:26] <ryanneufeld> Speaking of the docs
[13:42:40] <ryanneufeld> I feel like this needs a big yellow "WATCHOUT" http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/page-cache.html
[13:43:08] <ryanneufeld> cause the only warning is on the bottom of the page, and a lot of people are like "TL;DNR;"
[13:46:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah this is deffinitly mini vs regular for tests on the mini form page every text like input zooms in and out number text search 
[13:47:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, I will look if I see something in the code
[13:47:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: textarea too
[13:54:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont see the problem yet however am i crazy or on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/textinput.js#L98 on this line do we bind to focus then blur then focus then blur????
[13:59:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it looks like we can do that with less code indeed
[14:00:19] <uGoMobi> as far as I know focus() and bind("focus") does exactly the same
[14:00:24] <uGoMobi> same for blur
[14:00:53] <arschmitz> yes focus is a shortcut method for bind('focus'
[14:01:20] <arschmitz> which post 1.7 is just a shortcut method for on focus
[14:01:58] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:02:02] <arschmitz> which no should be _on('focus' for widgets like this
[14:02:07] <arschmitz> lol
[14:02:54] <uGoMobi> right
[14:03:07] <arschmitz> anyway lol
[14:03:54] <arschmitz> i wonder if this has to do with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/textinput.js#L112 where we re enable zoom regardless of the inital value
[14:04:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am looking at this code now https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.zoom.js#L25
[14:04:53] <arschmitz> me too!
[14:05:15] <uGoMobi> !disabledInitially
[14:05:26] <uGoMobi> so there is a check
[14:05:32] <arschmitz> yeah i noticed that so nothing "should" happen there
[14:05:44] <arschmitz> weird thing to me still is how its mini only
[14:05:57] <arschmitz> to me this would point to css but that shouldnt matter
[14:07:49] <arschmitz> all mini really does is add a class
[14:08:18] <uGoMobi> did you notice it with mini textinput/textarea as well as mini selects?
[14:08:31] <arschmitz> only textinput / textarea
[14:08:45] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[14:08:56] <arschmitz> iv only been able to reproduce it on a select once and it was after an orientation change into landscape
[14:09:14] <arschmitz> it was a mini one but im not sure it wasent just a coincidence
[14:10:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: all mini does in the to text inputs is set font-size:14px; 
[14:11:18] <arschmitz> *in the docs
[14:11:20] <uGoMobi> yes and maybe some padding adjustments
[14:11:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not even all other css is overrided by the fieldcontain
[14:12:21] <arschmitz> the only active css for mini in docs is font-size:14px
[14:13:16] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:13:27] <arschmitz> this is weird!
[14:22:40] <arschmitz> need to make a test page with a regular sized one set to 14px with css
[14:23:00] <arschmitz> see if its some weird ios bug with smaller font inputs or something crazy
[14:23:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good idea
[14:23:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it zooms in and then zooms out right away, correct?
[14:23:40] <arschmitz> yes
[14:27:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: holy shit its the 14px!!!
[14:27:14] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:27:15] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/556/edit
[14:27:32] <arschmitz> first one is fine both second and third zoom in and out
[14:28:23] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:28:38] <uGoMobi> now let's try 15px and 13px
[14:28:40] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:30:35] <arschmitz> its anything below 16px
[14:30:53] <arschmitz> i updated test page regular and 16 are fine everything else zooms
[14:33:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it doesn't happen if we use em value instead px!
[14:33:17] <uGoMobi> :D
[14:33:41] <arschmitz> really?
[14:33:57] <arschmitz> thats crazy!
[14:34:21] <uGoMobi> no
[14:34:23] <uGoMobi> :(
[14:34:31] <uGoMobi> that was a one time things
[14:34:40] <arschmitz> oh ok that would be crazy
[14:35:05] <arschmitz> my guess is this is an intentional feature on ios to zoom for small text
[14:35:28] <arschmitz> and we cannt prevent it only reverse it
[14:47:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im thinking close wont fix 
[14:49:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am afraid we can't fix it for mini, but the issue reporter didn't mention mini
[14:49:59] <uGoMobi> did we do anything to fix it for regular size?
[14:54:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I changed my mind... if you set user-scalable=no in the markup it doesn't happen with mini inputs
[14:55:42] <uGoMobi> but if we set it programmatically it does
[14:56:15] <uGoMobi> so maybe there is a way to fix it after all
[15:11:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Interesting it must store initial value or something because using fixed toolbars fixes it
[15:12:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it does change the value
[15:12:11] <arschmitz> ***does not fix it
[15:12:49] <uGoMobi> I just tested on desktop with preventFocusZoom set to true
[15:15:10] <arschmitz> So preventfocus ion fixed it?
[15:26:31] <toddmparker> hey all - back for a few
[15:26:37] <toddmparker> what did i miss?
[15:27:22] <uGoMobi> we are looking into some iOS pinch zoom issues
[15:29:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am not going to spend much more time on it now because I don't think this has highest priority, but let's not close yet
[15:30:32] <toddmparker> we already to a lot of monkey business to avoid iOS's select zoom in "feature"
[15:31:18] <toddmparker> preventFocusZoom is some black magic. it's possible iOS decides to just zoom in under various conditions like font size
[15:31:28] <toddmparker> but i agree it's not a critical thing, esp if hard to repro

[15:32:16] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14e4c0be9 15Jasper de Groot: Textinput: reduce code.
[15:32:56] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes, we noticed the user-scalable is ignored... you only see it with mini inputs
[15:33:21] <toddmparker> bah.
[15:33:22] <uGoMobi> user-scalable=no that is
[15:33:34] <toddmparker> probably not fixable. we're jumping through a lot of hoops now anyway
[15:33:53] <toddmparker> also an issue on inline selects that are full sized?
[15:34:41] <uGoMobi> do you mean this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5333 ?
[15:37:48] <toddmparker> waaait. if he's on iOS6, the zoom fix we had in 1.1 broke
[15:38:10] <toddmparker> we've since fixed that in 2.0, but if they are using 6 with 1.1, it's broken
[15:39:17] <uGoMobi> I only tested with latest code
[15:39:31] <toddmparker> and you could repro?
[15:40:03] <uGoMobi> no, but we haven't tested on iPhone5 / iOS6
[15:40:21] <toddmparker> ralated: we need to find that iOS fix and make sure it made it into 1.1-stable so it's in 1.1.2.
[15:40:23] <uGoMobi> couldn't repo it on iOS5
[15:40:37] <toddmparker> right. it's a problem with 1.1 and iOS6
[15:40:45] <uGoMobi> let me check
[15:44:22] <toddmparker> I commented anyway
[15:44:49] <toddmparker> I wouldn't spend much time on it unless it's something you can repo in common cases
[15:44:57] <toddmparker> so many other fish to fry
[15:45:23] <uGoMobi> yes you are right
[15:45:24] <toddmparker> i gotta run, sorry!
[15:45:29] <toddmparker> yeah? cool.
[15:45:33] <toddmparker> I think we can close then
[15:45:43] <toddmparker> we have a fix coming
[15:45:53] <toddmparker> mind commenting and closing?
[15:46:12] <uGoMobi> yes I will take care of it
