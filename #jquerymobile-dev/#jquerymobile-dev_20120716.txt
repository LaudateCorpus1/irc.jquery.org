[00:46:58] <gnarf> uGoMobi: the server jquerymobile.com is hosted on right now is being shut off
[00:47:04] <gnarf> soon

[05:19:51] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: you around?
[05:56:23] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: now here !  Hi!
[05:56:34] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[05:56:50] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: First of all, sorry about yesterday if I sounded like I was picking on you. Want to be sure that we are cool! Are we?
[05:57:09] <MauriceG> Yes, of cause. Never mind!
[05:57:16] <uGoMobi> ok great!
[05:57:17] <MauriceG> corse*
[05:57:30] <uGoMobi> then my Q... do you have an iOS4 device?
[05:58:00] <MauriceG> yes, I have. I saw your message right now at github.  I'll take look
[05:58:20] <uGoMobi> ok thanks... trying to clean up some old issues
[05:58:47] <MauriceG> that's fine! I'll try to help on this.
[06:02:09] <MauriceG> I have a client service now. I hope it will not take too much time and I'll report when I've tested "your" issue.
[06:02:54] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: sure, thanks
[07:59:05] <toddparker> uGoMobi: you are a bug triage machine. thanks
[07:59:16] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:00:27] <uGoMobi> when I start cleaning old issues I get OCD :)
[08:00:46] <toddparker> i like it
[08:00:49] <toddparker> i get that way too
[08:00:58] <toddparker> won't stop until i get the bug count to X
[08:01:06] <toddparker> we're close ego breaking into the 200's
[08:01:06] <uGoMobi> yeah exactly
[08:01:18] <toddparker> go go go
[08:01:19] <uGoMobi> was aiming 329
[08:01:23] <uGoMobi> at*
[08:01:32] <toddparker> close
[08:01:39] <toddparker> so i started adding some popup positioning stuff to the docs this weekend, but just to the index page
[08:03:04] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes I saw that, nice work
[08:03:13] <uGoMobi> the popup page looks much better this way
[08:03:55] <uGoMobi> toddparker: where else would you want positioning stuff besides the index page?
[08:04:18] <toddparker> options
[08:04:23] <toddparker> and data-attr ref
[08:04:27] <toddparker> if not in both places
[08:04:30] <toddparker> already
[08:04:45] <toddparker> one Q i has was where that position-to attr should go
[08:04:49] <uGoMobi> yeah, is already done
[08:04:54] <toddparker> cool
[08:05:01] <toddparker> i told _|Nix|_ to add it to the popup, not the link
[08:05:07] <toddparker> but i wanted o talk that through
[08:05:11] <toddparker> it's an odd one
[08:05:17] <toddparker> we put transition on the link
[08:05:35] <toddparker> not sure whether position is intrinsic to the popup itself
[08:05:44] <toddparker> or if it should be variable based on how it's called
[08:05:48] <toddparker> discuss.
[08:05:50] <uGoMobi> hmm, not sure what is best
[08:06:06] <toddparker> if it's on the link, it might be more flexible
[08:06:27] <toddparker> when i built the demos, i tried it that way first which is saying something
[08:06:35] <uGoMobi> I think best is on the link but we named it like you should put it on the popup
[08:06:54] <toddparker> johnbender, agcolom, gseguin, uGoMobi, jasondscott, MauriceG - thoughts on this?
[08:07:23] <toddparker> uGoMobi: not sure the name would work on either
[08:07:37] <toddparker> _|Nix|_ too obviously
[08:08:36] <uGoMobi> nah, I don't think the name is confusing... +1 for on the link
[08:09:51] <uGoMobi> toddparker:  the popup events work as well... see the photos
[08:10:27] <uGoMobi> toddparker: has recalculating popup position on resize / orientation change been discussed before?
[08:16:05] <toddparker> i was mentioned
[08:16:08] <toddparker> it should re-calc
[08:21:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you bind the positioning function to throttledresize and orientationchange events ?
[08:28:32] <toddparker> btw - switching to no transition did help quite a bit with speed
[08:29:07] <toddparker> transitions are going to be slow since the animation itself it time dot be ~1 second and the browser seems to take a breath while exit's getting ready to run it

[08:42:31] <toddparker> i'd rather have these be consistent
[08:42:43] <toddparker> ageed?
[08:42:43] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes, me too

[09:07:50] <johnbender> toddparker: reading
[09:07:50] <bot-t> (25 hours 30 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell johnbender : John, when I do '$ grunt js #' on master the unminified file has an error on line 32 where there is a line-break between version: "1.2.0-pre and ",
[09:09:25] <johnbender> toddparker: as a side note I played with an htc one x in the att store on Saturday and the transitions were just about as good as the iphone
[09:09:44] <johnbender> uGoMobi: let me take a look
[09:11:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hmm, I'm not seeing it
[09:12:37] <uGoMobi> johnbender: strange, I tried on 1.1-stable branch as well... same issue, different line
[09:13:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I will try if I can find out what is going on
[09:20:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it's just inserting random line breaks?
[09:21:06] <uGoMobi> johnbender: break (just one), yes
[09:21:42] <uGoMobi> after the version number, so the closing quotes end up on next line
[09:21:44] <johnbender> uGoMobi: well it sounds like it's ending up in different places
[09:21:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: is there a line break in that file by chance?
[09:22:24] <johnbender> doesn't appear to be on my version of master
[09:24:48] * uGoMobi is checking now
[09:25:27] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah, version.txt contains two lines
[09:25:41] <uGoMobi> one empty line at the end
[09:26:22] <johnbender>  that's wrong :(
[09:26:30] <johnbender> but it should account for that
[09:26:33] <johnbender> I'll make the change
[09:26:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: can you take the whitespace out of version.txt in the meantime
[09:27:56] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes, but still strange because I never added that line break
[09:28:11] <uGoMobi> johnbender: if I look at the code on github I don't see it either
[09:28:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah, and there's a line to replace it in master
[09:29:16] <johnbender> that is, a line to replace line breaks with nothing
[09:30:14] <uGoMobi> aha, when you click edit the extra line is visible
[09:31:18] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that's not right at all
[09:31:34] <johnbender> toddparker: it seems like anything that has to do with the action of bringing the popup should be on the link
[09:31:46] <johnbender> that's the reason the transition seems to make so much sense there
[09:32:13] <johnbender> toddparker: actions on the link, visual/content attributes on the popup ?
[09:36:56] <uGoMobi> johnbender: want me to remove that empty line from version.txt ?
[09:38:13] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yes please
[09:38:20] <johnbender> though I don't see it in my local version of the file :(

[09:40:43] <uGoMobi> johnbender: well it was visible on master on github, but not anymore :)
[09:40:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: cool
[09:41:10] <uGoMobi> let me test grunt js #
[09:41:59] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I stand corrected it's there
[09:42:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: are you on windows by chance?
[09:42:21] <uGoMobi> yes
[09:42:24] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ah
[09:42:35] <uGoMobi> and linux
[09:42:42] <uGoMobi> but this was on windows
[09:43:02] <johnbender> uGoMobi: can you add the carriage return back in to test on windows, the grunt.js config accounts for the return character
[09:43:07] <johnbender> one sec

[09:44:33] <johnbender> :(
[09:44:47] <uGoMobi> he doesnt drive?
[09:44:57] <gseguin> the driver refused to load
[09:45:07] <uGoMobi> lazy bastard
[09:45:14] <agcolom> hello :-)
[09:45:15] <gseguin> he said it was too dangerous to park in front of our place
[09:45:26] <gseguin> wanted to shuttle with a smaller truck
[09:45:30] <uGoMobi> why? do you live in the getto now?
[09:45:33] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[09:45:35] <gseguin> that costs only $700/mile
[09:45:59] <agcolom> Hi Jasper, Hi Ghislain!
[09:46:18] <agcolom> gseguin: OMG! Are you back to your old home??
[09:46:32] <gseguin> hey agcolom
[09:47:09] <gseguin> so still staying at our place in CA until tomorrow morning when another driver shows up
[09:47:27] <agcolom> crazy!
[09:47:37] <agcolom> my daughter is 13 tomorrow!!!!!!
[09:47:49] <gseguin> happy birthday to her!
[09:48:32] <agcolom> and she's away for the whole week! Doing rafting, climbing, abseiling, surfing, etc... with her school in Devon!!!!
[09:48:32] <gseguin> johnbender: so short story long, I should be in Colorado Wed morning
[09:49:07] <agcolom> gseguin: johnbender: just need to double check something with you:
[09:49:40] <agcolom> here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/selects/options.html
[09:50:32] <agcolom> take corners (1st option) described as a boolean, but set using double quotes: $('select').selectmenu({ corners: "false" });
[09:50:43] <agcolom> should the double quotes disappear?
[09:50:54] <agcolom> same for all the boolean on this page?
[09:51:58] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I tested putting the carriage return back in on windows but error again... I never remember which OS uses \n and which uses \r
[09:52:30] <uGoMobi> johnbender: shouldn't you check for both?
[09:56:53] <uGoMobi> toddparker: is it ok if we fix this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3296 with just a line in the docs?

[10:01:52] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I leave the carriage return in version.txt in 1.1-stable for now so we have something to test, ok?
[10:02:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah ignore those for now
[10:03:05] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I need someone to test it on windows
[10:03:11] <johnbender> I know it works on linux :D
[10:03:15] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I just didi
[10:03:20] <uGoMobi> did*
[10:03:26] <johnbender> uGoMobi: and it worked?
[10:03:31] <johnbender> it normalizes the \n ?
[10:03:31] <uGoMobi> nope
[10:03:33] <johnbender> kk
[10:03:50] <uGoMobi> I think Win uses \r... does that make sense?
[10:03:58] <johnbender> \r\n
[10:04:10] <uGoMobi> yeah
[10:04:25] <johnbender> could just add the extra replace call at least

[10:44:22] <toddparker> that $700/mi is highway robbery
[10:44:34] <gseguin> yeah that's what I thought too
[10:45:07] <gseguin> especially when the driver who delivered 2 years ago had no problem parking his tractor-trailer there
[10:45:09] <toddparker> what is the normal rate?
[10:45:31] <gseguin> that's actually the normal rate for shutteling
[10:45:46] <toddparker> but for long haul?
[10:46:15] <gseguin> it's like ~ 60 cents/lbs
[10:46:25] <toddparker> ah
[10:46:26] <gseguin> for that distance

[11:58:34] <gnarf> that you talked with richard
[11:58:51] <gnarf> i hadn't really gotten to that machine yet, but now its one of the last things holding that machine up
[11:58:52] <gnarf> also
[11:58:54] <gnarf> FYI
[11:59:03] <gnarf> *.origin.jquery.com have moved
[12:02:28] <johnbender> gnarf: the server? or it's at a new url?
[12:02:33] <johnbender> I'm assuming the former
[12:02:45] <gnarf> server
[12:02:51] <gnarf> it moved from planet -> jq03
[12:02:55] <johnbender> gnarf: is that in one of the emails you sent out?
[12:03:09] <gnarf> so any ssh scripts that push to it might be bitching about it
[12:03:11] <gnarf> johnbender: probably
[12:03:24] <gnarf> johnbender: i was moving shit for like 10 hours yesterday, hard to remember what i emailed about
[12:04:44] <agcolom> toddparker: johnbender: is this correct? https://github.com/MauriceG/jquery-mobile/commit/62caec59d5308724ae1713490f7b2e005e17813f

[12:05:11] <agcolom> uGoMobi: you may know this one too ^
[12:05:18] <johnbender> gnarf: I just need to update my ssh config
[12:05:32] <gnarf> johnbender: ++ :)
[12:05:39] <gnarf> johnbender: its just known_hosts
[12:05:47] <gnarf> gotta remove the old entry for *.origin.jquery.com
[12:05:54] <gnarf> and then prime it by ssh'n there
[12:05:59] <gnarf> I actuaally made a jqadmin account
[12:06:03] <johnbender> agcolom: you can prevent both
[12:06:05] <gnarf> that has full write privs to those folders
[12:06:10] <johnbender> there are two attributes for that
[12:06:33] <johnbender> gnarf: kk nuice
[12:06:36] <johnbender> *nice
[12:06:51] <johnbender> hmm let me check

[12:07:42] <johnbender> *domain
[12:08:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: agcolom: yah we need to fix that, but it does apply elsewhere
[12:08:13] <johnbender> so it's not a documentation problem
[12:08:20] <johnbender> that is, if it's actually an issue
[12:08:23] <johnbender> I haven't looked at it
[12:08:36] <johnbender> agh
[12:08:36] <johnbender> ok
[12:08:44] <johnbender> I need to eat before I go workout
[12:08:46] * johnbender is late
[12:08:50] <agcolom> johnbender: ok, so I do not pull this PR in?
[12:08:58] <johnbender> agcolom: lets at least wait on it'
[12:09:04] <agcolom> sure!
[12:09:15] <agcolom> have a nice lunch and gym :-)
[12:09:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: did you noticed \r\n is working on windows ?

[12:29:06] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (3w, 5h ago): Docs: Add a paragraph about using same page transition (page-transitions.html)
[12:50:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think you can land it but I suggest to remove the last part (Currently...)
[12:50:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: this way it is consistent with http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/methods.html
[12:51:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: and also because it seems like there are still issues with this (also when using transitions other than slide) https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4078

[12:52:30] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, thanks a lot,
[12:52:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: so it's probably better not to say it does work with those tranisitions

[12:54:40] <agcolom> uGoMobi: so is there some work happening now or soon to make this work with all transitions?
[12:55:16] <agcolom> (or is this just a "nice to have" but not "essential" ?)
[12:55:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't think so, scottjehl is assigned but don't think he had time to look into it already
[12:55:39] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, thanks.
[12:56:09] <uGoMobi> agcolom: if you ask me... yes that descibes this feature well, but maybe for others it is important
[12:56:40] <uGoMobi> I never had a situation where I was on a page and thought... let's navigate to this same page again ;-)
[12:57:10] <agcolom> i know!
[12:57:24] <uGoMobi> but it is probably useful for something
[12:57:31] <agcolom> maybe this is useful when the page is refreshed regularly??
[12:57:35] <uGoMobi> so it says more about my limitations ;-)
[12:58:33] <uGoMobi> nah, then you just want to pull in updated content... no transition

[13:02:59] <uGoMobi> :D
[13:05:44] <agcolom> uGoMobi: looks good. I can't think of anything (of the top of my head ;-) ) that's missing... will let you know if I do...

[13:33:39] <uGoMobi> yeah, but I am sure they read back :)

[13:35:58] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok thanks
[13:36:02] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I think jblas's response is fine

[14:22:01] <Wilto> “… Number of Android devices that have accessed Google Play within a 14-day period,” though. Not 100% on whether that’s a fair representative.
[14:22:09] <johnbender> Wilto: brutal
[14:22:18] <johnbender> Wilto: 2.x is still > 80%
[14:22:33] <Wilto> It sure ain’t good.
[14:22:42] <johnbender> Wilto: that actually may biased in favor of new devices
[14:22:51] <Wilto> That was my concern.
[14:22:54] <Wilto> Which is _horrifying_.

[14:34:02] <agcolom> dear git expert, how do I revert a commit?
[14:36:40] <uGoMobi> git revert [commit#]
[14:37:18] <agcolom> thank you :-)
[14:37:19] <uGoMobi> if it is a PR... -m 1 [commit#]
[14:40:27] <agcolom> luckily my partner knows vi!!!!! Another thing I need to learn!!!!
[14:41:15] <agcolom> uGoMobi: do I need to do a push after the git revert?
[14:42:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: did you push the original commit already... then yes
[14:42:56] <uGoMobi> the revert is just another commit, be it exactly the opposite of the commit you are reverting
[14:43:01] <agcolom> great! Thanks all sorted now!
[14:43:06] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:43:11] <agcolom> phew!
[14:43:38] <agcolom> when I start to do silly things, then it's time to go to bed!
[14:43:44] <agcolom> thanks a lot uGoMobi :-)

[14:45:30] <uGoMobi> I use gitk and git GUI
[14:45:44] <agcolom> nice!
[14:45:52] <uGoMobi> Gitx is the OSX version that combines both
[14:46:11] <uGoMobi> it's WYSIWYG instead of command line
[14:46:26] <agcolom> is it really good?
[14:46:54] <uGoMobi> well I don't know Gitx, but I am happy with gitk and GUI
[14:47:09] <agcolom> ok, may give it a try sometime...
[14:47:14] <agcolom> thanks :-
[14:47:16] <agcolom> :-)
[14:47:54] <agcolom> bedtime I think... I was up at 5am to take my daughter to school for her trip!
[14:48:15] <agcolom> (the good thing is there is no traffic at that time!)
[14:48:15] <uGoMobi> good night

[14:50:06] <johnbender> Wilto: moreover, you are significantly more likely to use the app store earlier on in your phone's life
[14:50:10] <johnbender> because you need to get your apps

[15:49:59] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yes, unfortunately we still have it in the js/index.php and also in js/jquery.mobile.js
[15:50:06] <johnbender> the first is for dev includes
[15:50:14] <johnbender> and the second is for the require.js build
[15:51:02] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I see
[15:51:36] <uGoMobi> johnbender: is it diffult to move those to a single place?
[15:51:44] <uGoMobi> difficult*
[15:53:57] <uGoMobi> or more a matter of takes some time because a links need to be updated?
[15:54:18] <toddparker> i need to head out
[15:54:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: we'd have to centralize it to json or some such
[15:54:26] <toddparker> did i miss anything i need to weigh in on?
[15:54:33] <johnbender> toddparker: not from me
[15:54:45] <uGoMobi> toddparker: not that I know of
[15:54:51] <toddparker> did _|Nix|_ pop in
[15:55:06] <toddparker> wondering about moving that position option back to the link
[15:55:07] <uGoMobi> nope, _|Nix|_ didn't popup in
[15:55:09] <uGoMobi> ;)
[15:55:11] <toddparker> kk
[15:55:20] <toddparker> anyone feeling up to that?
[15:55:28] <toddparker> not sure what his schedule is
[15:56:07] <uGoMobi> I will ask him tomorrow
[15:56:46] <uGoMobi> He is often available here in the morning (European time)
[16:28:30] <gnarf> have you guys had any builds going up to the cdn today yet? just want to make sure that proess is workin
