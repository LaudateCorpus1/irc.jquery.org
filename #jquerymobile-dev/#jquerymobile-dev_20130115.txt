[04:22:56] <toddmparker_> hi all! woo hoo
[04:23:26] <toddmparker_> agcolom: so sorry about you name. damn you, apple autocorrect. i fixed the blog.
[04:25:20] <toddmparker_> i fixed the copyright on the site, forgot about the docs
[04:39:01] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker_ 
[04:39:23] <toddmparker_> morning uGoMobi 
[04:40:02] <_|Nix|__> Hey!
[04:40:05] <uGoMobi> should the copyright be changed to 2013 or 2012-2013?
[04:40:10] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|__ 
[04:40:21] <_|Nix|__> Oh, I'm not authed ...
[04:41:32] <toddmparker_> hey _|Nix|__ 
[04:41:42] <toddmparker_> in the docs?
[04:41:50] <uGoMobi> yes
[04:42:15] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[04:42:16] <uGoMobi> but also in LICENSE.txt
[04:43:12] <toddmparker_> wonder if scott_gonzalez is around
[04:43:29] <toddmparker_> i thought we had a range already
[04:43:43] <toddmparker_> johnbender noted this:
[04:43:46] <toddmparker_> "I somehow managed to read over the examples in the navigation section when
[04:43:46] <toddmparker_> I did my proofread. It’s `$.mobile.navigate` now and not, `$.navigate`."
[04:43:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm here.
[04:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: The copyright should be first year, current year.
[04:44:23] <toddmparker_> hi scott_gonzalez - opinion on the date in our docs footer 
[04:44:26] <toddmparker_> oh, perfect
[04:44:34] <toddmparker_> 2010-2013
[04:44:46] <scott_gonzalez> Joel said 2010, 2013.
[04:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> At least for code.
[04:44:54] <toddmparker_> the site says "© 2010-13 The jQuery Foundation"
[04:44:59] <toddmparker_> shoudl it just match that?
[04:45:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'll follow up for sites.
[04:45:06] <uGoMobi> jQuery Foundation is founded in 2012 right?
[04:45:06] <toddmparker_> I can also up the site
[04:45:38] <toddmparker_> oh, that's right. we used to have a range, then maybe switched to 2012 when we switched to the foundation.
[04:45:55] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, yes, I wonder how that comes into play here.
[04:46:05] <toddmparker_> lawyers
[04:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, what we actually say for code is jQuery Foundation and other contributors.
[04:46:23] <toddmparker_> figure we can just copy off you and core
[04:46:55] <toddmparker_> the new UI site says "Copyright 2013 The jQuery Foundation."
[04:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> Well, all of our sites are just current year.
[04:47:09] <uGoMobi> but that site was launched in 2013
[04:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> No it wasn't.
[04:47:26] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[04:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> Every site uses `Copyright <?php echo date('Y'); ?>`
[04:48:07] <toddmparker_> oh, ok. i'm still updated the busted old site
[04:49:42] <toddmparker_> so scott_gonzalez do you think the official word on code copyright is 2010, 2013? or 2010-2013, or just 2013?
[04:49:48] <toddmparker_> brb
[04:51:11] <scott_gonzalez> 2010, 2013
[04:51:23] <scott_gonzalez> See the email that Dave forwarded 5 days ago.
[04:51:31] <scott_gonzalez> It should actually be at the top of your inbox because I just replied to it.
[04:58:34] <toddmparker_> cool
[04:58:42] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: guess we have our answer then
[04:59:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: Copyright 2010, 2013 jQuery Foundation and other contributors
[05:00:38] <uGoMobi> for docs footer and (mit) license.txt
[05:00:45] <uGoMobi> I will update
[05:02:27] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker: uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: agcolom: 
[05:02:33] <arschmitz> lot of people about this morning
[05:02:41] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:10:31] <toddmparker_> hey arschmitz 
[05:10:50] <toddmparker_> thanks uGoMobi - been fixing the blog posts. always little things to update
[05:11:06] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker_
[05:11:45] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: about the blog post noticed for swipe you link to api docs but the api docs are not up to date
[05:11:53] <arschmitz> they dont show the extensibility

[05:28:58] <toddmparker_> arschmitz - i know, that's why I added as much info as I could. Anne is going to add that today.
[05:29:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: cool 
[05:29:42] <agcolom> arschmitz: what is missing in the api docs?
[05:30:36] <arschmitz> agcolom: I updated swipe here yesterday http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[05:31:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: pretty sure we already talked about it though you said you were going to try and do it today i think
[05:31:50] <agcolom> oh yes, will do that today...
[05:32:06] <agcolom> sorry I thought you meant the final examples were not working ;-)
[05:33:00] <arschmitz> nope everything i have seen is working :)
[05:40:56] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1052: UNSTABLE in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1052/
[06:04:29] <agcolom> toddmparker_: thanks for the nice note in the blog! :-) 
[06:06:02] <toddmparker_> agcolom: you deserve it. how many months have you been working on the API docs?
[06:06:53] <agcolom> since May or June I think... I can check... (I'm at work so my laptop is at home)
[06:07:18] <agcolom> I can check on github
[06:08:00] <toddmparker_> long time
[06:08:18] <toddmparker_> hey all - don't think johnbender is on and I wanted to double check this before editing the blog
[06:08:21] <toddmparker_> "I somehow managed to read over the examples in the navigation section when
[06:08:21] <toddmparker_> I did my proofread. It’s `$.mobile.navigate` now and not, `$.navigate`."
[06:08:32] <toddmparker_> that both both the event and method?
[06:09:04] <agcolom> looks like June - so 8 months!
[06:09:09] <toddmparker_> thinking just the method
[06:09:27] <agcolom> I think there's method and one is event
[06:09:27] <toddmparker_> wow agcolom - thought it was 6 months
[06:09:34] <toddmparker_> agcolom: right
[06:09:39] <agcolom> beginning of june
[06:10:01] <toddmparker_> just not sure if event should be that too
[06:10:01] <agcolom> have to do some work... catch you later...
[06:10:08] <toddmparker_> thanks agcolom 
[06:10:14] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi or arschmitz ^^
[06:11:25] <arschmitz> hi toddmparker_
[06:11:33] <arschmitz> whats the question about navigate?
[06:11:43] <arschmitz> or the build?
[06:12:42] <toddmparker_> johnbender: said... It’s `$.mobile.navigate` now and not, `$.navigate`."
[06:12:52] <arschmitz> yes he re namespaced it
[06:13:04] <toddmparker_> so in the blog post: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/01/14/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-3-0-beta/
[06:13:52] <arschmitz> oh toddmparker_: the "." between $ and mobile is missing
[06:14:17] <toddmparker_> yeah, that's fixed
[06:14:21] <arschmitz> ok
[06:14:22] <toddmparker_> bad search/replace
[06:14:43] <toddmparker_> so when we talk about the navigate event, does that also need the namespace?
[06:14:56] <toddmparker_> like
[06:14:59] <toddmparker_> A navigate event that normalizes the URL alteration events hashchange/popstate, and a $mobile.navigate method that allows users to receive extended traversal information in navigate bindings (eg, directionality).
[06:15:18] <arschmitz> just a sec im double checking right now
[06:15:23] <toddmparker_> ^^ Should it be "A mobile.navigate event...
[06:17:12] <arschmitz> i think its just a navigate event
[06:19:11] <toddmparker_> ok
[06:19:14] <toddmparker_> seems to be
[06:19:20] <toddmparker_> i can fix later if what i did was wrong
[06:19:25] <toddmparker_> heading in, talk in a bit
[06:19:37] <arschmitz> it IS just a navigate event
[06:19:45] <arschmitz> just the method moved
[06:19:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker_^^

[06:42:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you please remind me what you've found wrt. jsperf test-order-induced bias?
[06:42:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've got http://jsperf.com/popup-creation/3 now and I'd hate to have to re-acquire all the data for all possible orderings of the tests.
[06:42:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it seems like with certain tests not all the first test is biased faster
[06:43:28] <arschmitz> it got a lot worse with more then 2 tests
[06:43:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, really? That page has 4 tests ...
[06:43:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You mean the bias towards the first got worse?
[06:43:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or the bias towards earlier tests?
[06:44:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: as a quick test swap the first and last test and retest
[06:44:11] <arschmitz> both

[06:44:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wouldn't call it "quick" :)
[06:44:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: give me half a sec and ill tell you if its biased
[06:44:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, considering that observed bias, I'd say the results of http://jsperf.com/popup-creation/3 are pretty good.
[06:45:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm thinking that maybe I can devise a non-jsperf test that also measures popup creation and run that.
[06:46:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It would likely be less scientifica than the one on jsperf, but it might still be indicative.
[06:46:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i re ran with original popup as last test and it was the fastest in chrome
[06:49:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll change the descriptions to reflect the order ... I hope /that/ doesn't influence anything ... that'd be ridiculous ...
[06:49:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsperf.com/popup-creation/5
[06:49:59] <arschmitz> that is with the order changed
[06:50:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I saw it.
[06:50:43] <arschmitz> that one already has descriptons updated
[06:51:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: wOW!
[06:52:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: made a bit of a difference
[06:53:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll run it 11 times like I did with /3 and see ...
[06:53:55] <arschmitz> cool
[06:56:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man, this seems kinda useless ... it's completely dependent on test order :(
[07:07:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats why with my tests for make dom i broke them out and compared them all to a "Control" test
[07:07:33] <arschmitz> to eliminate any bias based on order

[08:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: It seem slike a really bad idea to be linking to stage.api.jquerymobile.com from the blog post.
[08:34:32] <Wilto> scott_gonzalez: Todd is tied up on a call; this gonna blow something up? Should I grab him?
[08:34:53] <scott_gonzalez> It's not gonna blow anything up, but people are going to start using the stage site now.
[08:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> As in bookmarking, sharing links, etc.
[08:36:03] <johnbender> toddmparker: scott_gonzalez: seconded
[08:36:16] <johnbender> that prevents us from testing there
[08:37:01] <Wilto> Ah, yeah.
[08:37:04] <johnbender> toddmparker: you got the navigate stuff right, sorry about that
[08:37:15] <Wilto> Good call; I’ll throw a pen at his head first chance I get.
[08:37:38] <johnbender> Wilto: I feel pretty bad about proofreading properly after the fact
[08:37:41] <johnbender> toddmparker: sorry about that
[08:37:52] <Wilto> BOO JOHNBENDER BOOOO
[08:37:57] <Wilto> S’cool.
[08:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> We can deploy api.jquerymobile.com if you want.
[08:38:37] <johnbender> uGoMobi: we can redeploy if you want
[08:38:44] <Wilto> scott_gonzalez: Oh, yeah, that works.
[08:38:53] <scott_gonzalez> The web hook is already setup. Let me check DNS.
[08:39:17] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like DNS isn't set up yet.
[08:39:26] <johnbender> Wilto: arschmitz: uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: gseguin: also master should be feature frozen for now
[08:39:29] <johnbender> bug fixes only
[08:39:31] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, because you have an existing site.
[08:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> Is it ok for the existing site to disappear?
[08:40:08] <gseguin> johnbender: I just updated the copyright as per toddmparker's request
[08:40:12] <Wilto> scott_gonzalez: api.jquerymobile.com? Yeah; should be okay. johnbender?
[08:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get the code onto the new server, so that we're ready to just switch the DNS.
[08:40:33] <uGoMobi> johnbender: we only need to replace the zip... old version and copyright is only in the docs
[08:40:34] <Wilto> I mean, I don’t recall us ever linking to that for any reason.
[08:40:50] <Wilto> Juging by http://hambone.jquerymobile.com/, we’re just pointing everything to the regular domain.
[08:40:54] <johnbender> uGoMobi: scott_gonzalez: might as well, since we're linking to it
[08:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> Wilto: Ah, ok
[08:41:10] <Wilto> http://doyouknowwhatisawesomeitis.jquerymobile.com/
[08:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[08:41:28] <Wilto> rememberthattimewiltobroke.jquerymobile.com
[08:41:30] <Wilto> okay done
[08:42:00] <scott_gonzalez> "This site provides API documentation for jQuery Mobile 1.0 to 1.2"
[08:42:11] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that should be updated on the home page.
[08:42:18] <Wilto> jQuery Mobile Docs Classic™.
[08:42:24] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> Also, "For jQuery 1.7.0 to 1.8.2."
[08:42:29] <Wilto> agcolom, that’s your turf, yeah?
[08:44:39] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: dang, I'll update that version info.
[08:53:19] <johnbender> uGoMobi: so I'm a go on deploying again?
[08:53:35] <arschmitz> Hi all sorry i was in a meeting 
[08:53:58] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah I think so.. not 100% sure if copyright is ok now
[08:54:15] <johnbender> uGoMobi: how do we double check it?
[08:54:37] <uGoMobi> 17:08 <toddmparker> copyright style we should use:
[08:54:37] <uGoMobi> 17:08 <toddmparker> jQuery v1.9.0 | Copyright 2005, 2013 jQuery Foundation, Inc. | jquery.org/license 
[08:54:37] <uGoMobi> 17:08 <toddmparker> but with our version info. 2010, 2013
[08:54:43] <uGoMobi> I just saw that ^^
[08:55:17] <uGoMobi> I changed it earlier to (C) 2010, 2013 jQuery Foundation and other contributors
[08:55:25] <uGoMobi> no Inc.
[08:58:01] <uGoMobi> gseguin changed it at two places
[08:58:09] <uGoMobi> in the license txt files
[08:58:21] <uGoMobi> not sure what should go in the docs footer
[09:01:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: do I need to change the copyright in the docs footer or is it ok now?
[09:03:58] <gseguin> gnarf: u there?
[09:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, api.jquerymobile.com is live.
[09:04:27] <gseguin> YEAH!
[09:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: You should update the links in the blog post now.
[09:06:43] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: to the api stage?
[09:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:07:14] <toddmparker> sweet, thanks scott_gonzalez 
[09:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[09:07:26] <toddmparker> i was going to pull those out totally, but now i can just update 'e,
[09:08:28] <toddmparker> I was thinking we could link to the stage version since it's pre-release but this is better
[09:09:48] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: http://api.jquerymobile.com/ gives me the homepage
[09:09:59] <toddmparker> just a DNS thing?
[09:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you can try flushing your DNS.
[09:10:23] <scott_gonzalez> dscacheutil -flushcache
[09:10:40] <toddmparker> gotcha
[09:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> I think there's a 1 hour TTL.
[09:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> So it should be live for everyone very soon.
[09:11:18] <toddmparker> ok, i'll make the update right now
[09:11:19] <johnbender> toddmparker: scott_gonzalez: agcolom: exciting
[09:11:33] <johnbender> definitely prefer the new docs :)
[09:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:11:58] <scott_gonzalez> Deployments are a snap with the new setup too.
[09:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> Tag with a semver. DONE!
[09:12:19] <toddmparker> cool
[09:12:26] <toddmparker> me too. way better
[09:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> All commits to master go to stage. All semver tags go to production.
[09:12:50] <johnbender> ajpiano: I think we landed at setting up a separate vagrant and puppet project for the wordpress stuff
[09:13:03] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: ah, now that makes sense
[09:13:06] <toddmparker> so do you think I should wait a bit for this to propagate 
[09:13:16] <toddmparker> if i push now, think people will see 404's
[09:13:29] <johnbender> toddmparker: no they'll just see the jqm homepage
[09:13:31] <johnbender> not much better though
[09:13:34] <gseguin> ryanneufeld, gnarf: where does jquerymobile.com/download-builder live? How do I update it?
[09:13:34] <johnbender> I would wait a bit
[09:13:36] <toddmparker> right :)
[09:13:43] <ajpiano> johnbender: yeah, that sounds reasonable
[09:13:44] <toddmparker> it's queued up
[09:14:03] <ajpiano> giving out the actual images we use in prod/staging seemed a little not-good to me
[09:14:12] <johnbender> ajpiano: I'm new to puppet though not new to config management so hopefully translating that doc you put together shouldn't be too painful
[09:14:19] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: can you see https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/DNS-AXFR
[09:14:29] <johnbender> ajpiano: yah we have sensative material in the puppet manifests
[09:14:33] <johnbender> which remindsm e
[09:14:52] <ajpiano> to seed your torrents of the puppet manifests?
[09:14:59] <gseguin> ha! thanks ryanneufeld 
[09:15:14] <toddmparker> time to fire up some bittorrentz
[09:16:23] <toddmparker> johnbender: I'd like to re-push the docs to update the core message on the homepage
[09:16:30] <toddmparker>  jQuery Mobile is the easiest way to build sites and apps that are accessible on all popular smartphone, tablet and desktop devices. For jQuery 1.7.0 to 1.8.2.
[09:17:10] <johnbender> toddmparker: you mean /demos/ ...
[09:17:12] <johnbender> ?
[09:17:21] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-beta.1/#
[09:17:23] <toddmparker> ya
[09:17:27] <johnbender> toddmparker: ugh
[09:17:33] <johnbender> that trailing hash is a bug I'm going to fix today 
[09:17:43] <toddmparker> just realized we didn't say 1.9 and 2.0
[09:18:23] <toddmparker> johnbender: should I do 1.7.0 or 1.7.1 as the lowest version?
[09:18:43] <toddmparker> for the highest, should it be 2.0.0 
[09:19:00] <gseguin> toddmparker: builder updated with 1.3.0beta1
[09:19:04] <toddmparker> I know we test git so we're ok
[09:19:08] <toddmparker> gseguin: sweet
[09:19:13] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah but that doesn't mean we support it
[09:19:48] <toddmparker> so at this moment, what should our support be for core
[09:19:59] <toddmparker> 1.9 is now final so that for sure
[09:20:14] <gseguin> johnbender: one of the nav module says: "Placeholder"
[09:20:21] <johnbender> toddmparker: 1.7 - 1.9 seems right
[09:20:27] <johnbender> gseguin: hahah of course it does
[09:20:28] <toddmparker> ok
[09:20:45] <uGoMobi> I updated docs to 1.8.3.
[09:20:48] <johnbender> gseguin: oooh now I get to see how small my nav setup is
[09:21:02] <johnbender> toddmparker: actually that's fine
[09:21:05] <johnbender> 1.9 just came out
[09:21:06] <uGoMobi> and we load 1.8.3 there
[09:21:10] <johnbender> we can update it before release
[09:21:14] <johnbender> we don't technically test with 1.9 either
[09:21:21] <johnbender> 1.8.3 is correct
[09:21:40] <johnbender> gseguin: how should we address that?
[09:21:48] <johnbender> gseguin: other than fixing it in the source tree
[09:21:54] <johnbender> gseguin: should I retag?
[09:21:59] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: guess we should change to 1.9 now that it's final
[09:22:09] <johnbender> toddmparker: uGoMobi: we don't test with it though
[09:22:13] <johnbender> so that's not accurate
[09:22:22] <johnbender> but it's up to you guys
[09:22:34] <toddmparker> so we haven't been testing against 1.9
[09:22:36] <uGoMobi> at the other end beta is good to test it
[09:22:43] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah retag and update the jquery-mobile-builder repo to point at the right tag
[09:22:43] <johnbender> toddmparker: we have, in the git build
[09:22:47] <uGoMobi> no, only git build
[09:22:48] <toddmparker> right
[09:23:48] <toddmparker> just trying to be clear on the blog and docs
[09:24:10] <johnbender> toddmparker: I would just do 1.8.3 and we can update it before release
[09:24:15] <johnbender> you could make a note there too
[09:25:32] <toddmparker> if someone uses 1.9 or 2.0 beta today with 1.3, they shouldn't have issues 
[09:27:45] <johnbender> toddmparker: that's correct, and before release we should support it
[09:27:56] <johnbender> so if you want to add it that's fine
[09:28:17] <johnbender> it's up to you really
[09:28:18] <johnbender> lol
[09:28:19] <toddmparker> It's less a bout what version we put in the zip and just what we say we support
[09:28:59] <arschmitz> personally if we are testing against git and are green and we are actively testing it that means we are supporting it right? 
[09:30:23] <toddmparker> latest working I want to add to the blog:
[09:30:25] <toddmparker> jQuery Mobile 1.3.0 is being actively tested to support versions of 1.9 and 2.0 of jQuery core and will be keeping in sync with their releases to let you take full advantage of the new hotness. The 1.3.0 Beta includes 1.8.3 because 1.9.0 just shipped today (congrats). When we hit the final release, 1.9.0 will be our default.  We will offer support back to 1.7.0 of core for folks on older versions with 1.3.0.
[09:30:57] <arschmitz> toddmparker: sounds good to me
[09:31:11] <toddmparker> johnbender ^
[09:31:39] <toddmparker> my only other Q is whether we should update the docs homepage to say 1.7.0 - 1.9.0 (or 2.0.0)?
[09:32:04] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i would think 1.9 since 2.0 is still beta
[09:33:00] <johnbender> toddmparker: sounds perfect, and to your second question it should be 1.9 since 2.0 isn't released
[09:33:11] <toddmparker> ok, cool. makes sense to me.

[09:34:20] <toddmparker> done there
[09:34:50] <toddmparker> johnbender: if you want to push that back up
[09:35:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: should the copyright in the footer be jQuery Foundation, Inc. ?
[09:35:20] <toddmparker> wait - dang it.
[09:35:23] <toddmparker> found this: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-beta.1/docs/about/getting-started.html
[09:35:31] <uGoMobi> the Inc. is missing
[09:36:09] <toddmparker> says 1.2.0 but in master, it's 1.3.0-beta
[09:36:20] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: here you can see which files contain version info https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Release-Instructions-Checklist
[09:36:39] <johnbender> toddmparker: uGoMobi: I need to teach you guys how to use grep/ack
[09:36:40] <johnbender> :(
[09:36:43] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you updated these tho?
[09:36:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I updated master after beta release
[09:36:56] <johnbender> (assuming you don't already know)
[09:37:01] <uGoMobi> just found out this morning that we didn't update the docs
[09:37:15] <toddmparker> ah. ok.
[09:37:26] <toddmparker> so johnbender if you don't mind updating 
[09:37:41] <toddmparker> we should fix that footer
[09:37:49] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:38:04] <uGoMobi> only add Inc. or also link to jquery.org/license
[09:38:05] <uGoMobi> ?
[09:38:11] <johnbender> gseguin: which module has the placeholder?
[09:38:29] <gseguin> johnbender: lemme check
[09:38:42] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: did you find what you needed?
[09:38:45] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: opinión on our footer here - http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-beta.1/
[09:38:54] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm like all of them
[09:38:54] <toddmparker> © 2012 jQuery Foundation and other contributors
[09:38:55] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: I did, thanks!
[09:38:58] <ryanneufeld> great
[09:38:58] <johnbender> gseguin: which field am I missing?
[09:39:23] <johnbender> gseguin: clearly they need a quick revamp :)
[09:39:24] <toddmparker> change to:
[09:39:25] <toddmparker> © 2010, 2013 jQuery Foundation Inc. and other contributors
[09:39:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I changed it already...http://jquerymobile.com/test/
[09:39:37] <uGoMobi> but no Inc. there
[09:39:40] <toddmparker> ah, cool
[09:39:56] <uGoMobi> and no link
[09:40:22] <gseguin> johnbender: events/navigate.js
[09:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: Sites should probably all match.
[09:40:33] <toddmparker> this is at least better
[09:40:41] <scott_gonzalez> The other sites are all "Copyright 2013 The jQuery Foundation."
[09:41:15] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: alright, i'm good with whatever will keep me out of trouble :)
[09:41:21] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/33
[09:41:52] <toddmparker> good point
[09:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> Sites are more difficult to document than code.
[09:43:07] <toddmparker> indeed
[09:43:22] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: let's go with what scott_gonzalez suggested for now
[09:43:38] <toddmparker> then johnbender can update the zip
[09:43:42] <uGoMobi> Copyright 2013 The jQuery Foundation.
[09:44:00] <uGoMobi> just remove the "2010, "  ?
[09:44:01] <johnbender> toddmparker: uGoMobi: I'm going to fix all the module descriptions and then retag, push, and deploy
[09:44:04] <toddmparker> yep
[09:44:10] <toddmparker> johnbender: perfecto
[09:44:21] <uGoMobi> one sec
[09:44:34] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: I updated the docs home to say "For jQuery 1.7.0 to 1.9.0." since 2.0 isn't final
[09:44:42] <uGoMobi> oh and remove "and other contributors" too?
[09:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> Just got onto jquery-wp-content and you won't have to worry abou this stuff :-P
[09:44:48] <toddmparker> also updated the blog a bit more
[09:44:57] <toddmparker> i know, hopefully that will be soon
[09:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: I'm not seeing a commit.
[09:45:38] <toddmparker> though we're going to need to have a non-WP site for demos
[09:45:50] <toddmparker> for that version change?
[09:46:55] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/862faa2f83db4e2aa83f8e364449b7c65c6565e1
[09:49:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: should I remove "and other contributors" as well?
[09:49:53] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: this in the footer of version?
[09:50:05] <uGoMobi> yes, docs footer
[09:50:20] <toddmparker> yeah, i guess so
[09:50:24] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:50:31] <toddmparker> I just updated the site to say that too: http://jquerymobile.com/?new
[09:51:05] <johnbender> gseguin: ok the tags pushed with the updated descriptions
[09:51:10] <johnbender> tag's
[09:51:11] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15johnbender merged 06master into 061.3.0-beta.1: 02http://git.io/zHJ0Sg
[09:51:25] <gseguin> oh wait you re-use the same tag?

[09:51:36] <gseguin> why not beta.2?
[09:52:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I guess it's too late to update the footer copyright
[09:52:10] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[09:52:48] <johnbender> gseguin: same question for why not beta.1
[09:53:14] <johnbender> gseguin: less confusion for people going to the builder?
[09:53:21] <johnbender> especially if it's just docs/description changes
[09:53:50] <toddmparker> yeah, it's just docs so i'd rather just replace the file
[09:54:06] <gseguin> that's fine, just that now there could be a difference between the zip that people download
[09:54:09] <toddmparker> that is the issue of shipping docs with code
[09:54:10] <gseguin> that's cool
[09:54:21] <toddmparker> the API site will improve that a bit
[09:54:22] <gseguin> builder updated automagically
[09:54:27] <toddmparker> cool
[09:54:53] <toddmparker> gseguin: could you add a note on the builder about the css?
[09:55:02] <gseguin> oh crap!
[09:55:04] <toddmparker> right now, you need to grab the images separately?
[09:55:10] <gseguin> I was going to get to that
[09:55:12] <toddmparker> any notes would be helpful
[09:55:33] <gseguin> sure I'll add a warning
[09:55:36] <toddmparker> and that odd thing with the empty css file - might be worth noting
[09:55:45] <gseguin> ok
[09:55:54] <toddmparker> maybe on the builder page, near the download button
[09:56:01] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: I was talking about the API site.
[09:56:06] <toddmparker> and we could also add it into the zip
[09:56:55] <toddmparker> yikes, i need to hop into a meeting. sorry guys
[09:57:04] <toddmparker> carry on
[09:58:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: going to redeploy
[09:58:32] <uGoMobi> johnbender: one sec
[09:59:45] <johnbender> uGoMobi: kk
[09:59:49] <johnbender> it's deploying anyway
[10:00:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: just let me know when you want me to push again
[10:00:30] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm making some additional corrections but those can weight until beta.2 or rc
[10:00:34] <johnbender> ...
[10:00:37] <johnbender> wait 
[10:00:39] <johnbender> good lord
[10:00:55] <arschmitz> that does not sound good lol
[10:00:59] <johnbender> I have a spelling plugin for irssi too

[10:01:46] <arschmitz> johnbender: i think im going to switch to irssi since i need to get something for my mac now
[10:02:06] <arschmitz> and irssi seems to be what everyone is using

[10:04:51] <agcolom> toddmparker: Quick thing to change for the blog: for completely flexibility (I think should say "for complete flexibility"?)
[10:14:47] <gseguin> toddmparker: I put: "Please note that the zip file will contain an empty jquery.mobile.custom.css file. 
[10:14:55] <gseguin> Also, images are not part of the bundle. For images, download the full build from http://jquerymobile.com/download/ and extract the images. We are working on generating zip files for images." at the bottom of the page

[10:30:30] <arschmitz> Wilto: i feel so useless on a mac right now looking at the download options for irssi lol
[10:31:06] <gseguin> arschmitz: install homebrew
[10:31:16] <Wilto> Seconded
[10:31:19] <arschmitz> gseguin i did!
[10:31:33] <arschmitz> because you recomended it and so did another one of my friends
[10:31:33] <gseguin> now: `brew install irssi`
[10:31:42] <gseguin> BOOM!
[10:31:45] <arschmitz> cool i havent used homebrew yet just installed it lol
[10:32:40] <arschmitz> im so useless on a mac right now :(
[10:35:04] <toddmparker> agcolom: fixed "completely flexibility"
[10:35:29] <johnbender> gseguin: arschmitz: `brew` is the clown of the package management world
[10:35:43] <johnbender> definitely better than nothing
[10:35:43] <Wilto> “Clown,” you say.
[10:35:45] <toddmparker> burrrn
[10:35:53] <Wilto> johnbender: teach me your ways
[10:36:02] <johnbender> Wilto: you're stuck with it
[10:36:16] <johnbender> there was a push at one point to get portage working on osx but that died
[10:36:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: there's also MacIrssi
[10:36:36] <johnbender> both work with the dotfiles
[10:37:15] <arschmitz> cool
[10:37:44] <Wilto> Someday—someday—I will become a Linux dude.
[10:38:09] <arschmitz> johnbender: you will probably see me asking a lot of dumb mac questions in the coming weeks ha ha im all good with linux and pc but iv never used or had a mac
[10:41:07] <jlembeck> I'd love being able to get apt on a mac, but yeah.. homebrew's what you have, and it's the best on a mac

[12:50:18] <agcolom> arschmitz: I push stuff to stage. I was not aware that  api.jquerymobile.com was live !!!! OMG!!!!
[12:50:50] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah scott_gonzalez put it live earlier :)
[12:51:07] <agcolom> oh! Nice! 
[12:51:29] <arschmitz> it was decided linking to stage in a blog post would be a bad idea
[12:53:35] <agcolom> yes, that makes sense :-)
[12:55:07] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Looks like I've been on the api docs for 7 or 7.5 months. 
[12:55:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man, this is ridiculous! Compare http://jsperf.com/popup-creation/7 and http://jsperf.com/popup-creation/8 ...
[12:55:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's, like, the same result, but the tests are reversed!
[12:56:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it really annoys me
[12:56:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, this pretty much renders jsperf useless ...
[12:56:35] <arschmitz> thats why you do a 3rd with original vs original
[12:57:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bah! I shouldn't be the one correcting for bias ...
[12:57:18] <arschmitz> i agree its a huge pain though 
[12:57:59] <johnbender> arschmitz: what's new?
[12:58:30] <arschmitz> i guess i did too much lab work in college used to dealing with stupiditly like this and having to analize the results across sets like this ugh thats why i dont do physics any more lol
[12:58:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ... I'll just do it locally ... at least, that way I can test with full-blown jQM instead of this hacked-together file.
[12:58:49] <arschmitz> johnbender: <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[12:58:49] <arschmitz> <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #4466: FIXED in 15 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/4466/

[12:59:00] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14824877e 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: changed example colors to use new site colors
[13:02:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: hmm not sure, I'll have to take your word for it
[13:02:41] <arschmitz> lol
[13:04:32] <arschmitz> johnbender: know much about jsperf?
[13:08:37] <johnbender> arschmitz: enough to use it a lot why?
[13:08:57] <arschmitz> keep seeing where it is biased towards the first test
[13:09:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: I think one of the creators hangs out in the jquery dev channel
[13:09:12] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's probably your test
[13:09:14] <arschmitz> ex: http://jsperf.com/popup-creation/7 vs http://jsperf.com/popup-creation/8
[13:09:41] <johnbender> arschmitz: there could be memory leaks or extra dom element creation
[13:09:58] <arschmitz> johnbender: all the tests iv seen it on involve dom node creation
[13:10:05] <johnbender> arschmitz: the teardown doesn't happen after every itteration 
[13:10:17] <arschmitz> it dosent? i thought that was what it was for?
[13:10:18] <johnbender> s/itt/it/
[13:10:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: nope, it happens after every test set
[13:10:30] <johnbender> yah
[13:10:35] <johnbender> that was confusing to me at first
[13:10:54] <johnbender> so when you run the test it does like X sample sets
[13:10:56] <johnbender> it runs it after those
[13:11:10] <johnbender> per execution cleanup has to be done in the test
[13:11:11] <arschmitz> oh ok
[13:11:15] <johnbender> arschmitz: as far as I know
[13:11:22] <johnbender> you might google a bit just to double check on that
[13:11:42] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah i was looking for stuff related to test order but couldnt find any
[13:11:49] <arschmitz> ill look into teardown though
[13:13:53] <johnbender> arschmitz: I spent *HOURS* working on jsperf tests for this https://github.com/johnbender/applications-cat-theory/tree/master/perf
[13:14:15] <arschmitz> i read your posts on that
[13:14:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and what have you found?
[13:14:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Did you also run into a similar bias?
[13:14:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: looks like we are not using teardown properly
[13:14:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no
[13:14:54] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jabarth opened issue #5452: 1.3.0 'tap' failing on button click but, will fire by $(".selector").tap();  02http://git.io/xKp6lw
[13:14:58] <johnbender> there's no bias
[13:15:07] <johnbender> teardown is a per sample set call
[13:15:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: it makes sense really
[13:15:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im redoing your tests right now
[13:15:33] <johnbender> the only odity is the "timed" section will be different
[13:16:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... but then how come when I take two tests (where the second one was shown to be faster) and reverse them, the second one is still shown to be faster?
[13:16:28] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/3d3g0w
[13:16:29] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14e36af12 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: updated page index to new versions of JQM and core
[13:16:38] <_|Nix|_> Also, interestingly, jsperf seems to cap the number of runs to 11.
[13:17:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: memory leask, dom bloat
[13:17:21] <johnbender> it could be a lot of things
[13:17:38] <johnbender> in the example that arschmitz showed me the cleanup was only in the teardown
[13:17:44] <johnbender> if that was indeed cleanup
[13:18:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:http://jsperf.com/jqmpopupcreate
[13:18:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't want to measure destroy though.
[13:19:12] <arschmitz> destroy should always be the same either way so it does not matter
[13:19:35] <arschmitz> as long as you didnt modify the destroy method
[13:20:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait! I see ... the teardown is not run every time the snippet is executed, but only between tests!
[13:20:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Arghhh!
[13:20:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly
[13:20:38] <_|Nix|_> *facepalm*
[13:20:55] <_|Nix|_> *foot = bullet;
[13:20:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsperf.com/jqmpopupcreatereverse
[13:21:17] <arschmitz> now they both always show the same
[13:21:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I'll be darned!
[13:21:45] <arschmitz> 'so while id rather not measure destroy it negates itself 
[13:21:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess ... it's a DC offset ...
[13:22:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... here we go again ...
[13:22:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... although I think I'll skip straight to popup4 ...
[13:22:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: this has turned into quite a little exploration into createing dom nodes
[13:23:07] <arschmitz> now you should be able to toss them all in a single test 
[13:23:19] <arschmitz> not have to make a ton and compare like i did before lol
[13:24:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: added your other 2 testshttp://jsperf.com/jqmpopupcreatereverse
[13:24:12] <arschmitz> dont remember the labels though
[13:25:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: damn there is a massive difference 
[13:26:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In favour of the modifications?
[13:26:22] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:26:34] <arschmitz> i think so in favor of popup3 and 4
[13:26:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[13:26:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsperf.com/jqmpopupcreatereverse you should just update the labels probably
[13:27:42] <_|Nix|_> *clunk* ... that's the sound of my jaw hitting the floor ...
[13:28:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bah! If I edit the labels it'll reset the results.
[13:28:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so it only has 3 chrome runs right now
[13:28:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: 3 seems slightly better than 4 ... but that's not unexpected - I'm not actually sure whether 4 is better than 3.
[13:29:20] <arschmitz> yeah 3 did win out very slightly
[13:29:27] <arschmitz> nothing id be concerned with
[13:30:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so what are the differences with popup3 and 4?
[13:30:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Different way of looping over the options during _create()
[13:31:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm debating whether we should loop over options during _create() at all: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Widget-Review
[13:32:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i see
[13:32:39] <arschmitz> so are both of these using makedom and clone? to gain the performance?
[13:33:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes.
[13:33:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, they're using native.
[13:34:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... a function immediately inside the IIFE which creates the template the first time it's called, and then caches it for subsequent clone()s.
[13:34:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, the first invocation is native + clone(), and subsequent ones are just clone().
[13:34:38] <arschmitz> ok cool which need to retest now but previously it looked like makedom and actual native were essentially same speed
[13:34:52] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15erikyuzwa opened issue #5453: scrolling with jqm1.3.0 beta 1 and jquery1.9.0 throws TypeError  02http://git.io/2G1mig
[13:35:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's NP. Once we have it in place, we can switch to it.
[13:35:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm thinking that we might even want to push this into 1.3 ...
[13:35:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know thats basicly what i was getting at
[13:35:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Performance is very important.
[13:35:49] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/pbR4sQ
[13:35:49] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14980c7f1 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: fixed swipe example indentation
[13:39:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: turns out $("<div/>") is very very fast
[13:40:26] <arschmitz> must have always had that test last lol
[13:42:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its just as fast as native
[13:42:20] <arschmitz> jsperf says fastest for both
[13:44:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! ... I guess that covers a lot of cases ... gotta wonder though about $( "<div/>", { ... } ) ...
[13:45:20] <arschmitz> ill check it out
[13:46:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i take that back it was a matter of "zoom" removed other tests and native is about 10% faster
[13:46:48] <arschmitz> on average its often much closer
[13:49:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: holy damn!!!!!
[13:50:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsperf.com/jqueryelementcreate !!!!!
[13:51:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: O_o
[13:52:06] <arschmitz> ha ha never mind 
[13:52:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It was $( "</div>" ) ...
[13:52:29] <arschmitz> yup
[13:52:33] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:52:57] <arschmitz> makes a big difference when you dont actually create a node lol
[13:53:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It seems it's not so much the element creation as the attach method that really makes a difference.
[13:53:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, creation helps, but using appendChild() /really/ helps.
[13:53:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Though not on WP7.5 ...
[13:53:54] <arschmitz> yeah 
[13:54:05] <arschmitz> is browser support good on appendChild?
[13:54:45] <arschmitz> looks like it is
[13:55:30] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/wFSNGQ
[13:55:30] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14fea7b2a 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: updated panel widget
[13:55:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i always like to double check everytime i assume something it it ends up biting me lol
[13:57:01] <arschmitz> so _|Nix|_: im joining the rest of you on irssi lol installed on my new mac this afternoon
[14:03:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *clap* *clap* *clap* *clap* *clap* 
[14:03:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Don't forget screen ... 
[14:03:59] <arschmitz> i use znc
[14:04:05] <arschmitz> so no need
[14:04:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[14:04:26] <arschmitz> yeah im on the jquery znc
[14:04:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, so when you connect to the server, it actually floods you with the history?
[14:04:49] <arschmitz> yup
[14:05:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... kinda like XMPP ...
[14:05:07] <arschmitz> yup
[14:05:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man, makes a really, /really/ small difference on WP7.5 ...
[14:05:43] <arschmitz> its funny because i use it on my phone and ipad which will only stay connected to irc for a max of 10 minutes while inactive i am the top znc user for jquery
[14:05:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lessee Android and iOS ...
[14:06:04] <arschmitz> because everytime i reconnect it floods me again
[14:06:21] <_|Nix|_> Why do they disconnect after 10 minutes?
[14:06:40] <arschmitz> i should probably switch to using screen for those i wont git push notifications but if im dissconnected i dont either
[14:06:45] <arschmitz> iOS app rules
[14:07:04] <arschmitz> can only maintain a connection on an inactive app for 10 minutes
[14:07:52] <_|Nix|_> Wow! Talk about nazi!
[14:08:11] <_|Nix|_> ... the policy, I mean ...
[14:08:13] <arschmitz> improves battery life a lot
[14:08:18] <_|Nix|_> *shake head* ...
[14:08:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll take continuous connectivity over battery life anytime ...
[14:08:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I run pidgin on my N900 all day ...
[14:08:55] <arschmitz> yeah i wish i had the choice at leasrt
[14:09:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: need to find something that can push ios notifications lol
[14:09:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's my main gripe with Apple. Their attitude is "no no no, my child, you do not know what is right for you. We'll set things up for you."
[14:10:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah they always have good reasons for most of it but still
[14:11:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Definitely, but if you /want/ to override whatever settings, you should still be able to do so without having to jailbreak, crack, and/or otherwise mutilate your device.
[14:11:50] <arschmitz> yeah i dont jailbreak them
[14:11:59] <arschmitz> too expensive to void my warrenty lol
[14:27:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, things are nowhere near as pronounced on the mobile side: http://jsperf.com/jqmpopupcreatereverse/2
