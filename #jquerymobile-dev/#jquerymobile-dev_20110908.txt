[06:44:52] <toddparker>  hi guys
[06:44:57] <toddparker> i'm here if you need testing help
[07:46:45] <scottjehl> here too
[07:46:51] <scottjehl> working on the dialog thing
[08:06:20] <toddparker> kinblas - another thing to document is the v mouse stuff. i barely documented it for b2.
[08:06:30] <toddparker> not for today maybe, but for RC1
[08:11:59] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #29: STILL FAILING in 5 min 54 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/29/
[08:33:33] <kinblas_> scottjehl: _nickel: toddmparker: gseguin: FYI, I see the double back problem on Desktop FireFox which should make it easy to debug!
[08:33:51] <scottjehl> in dialogs?
[08:35:10] <scottjehl> Okay. Well I've narrowed it to a pushState problem I think.
[08:36:07] <kinblas_> scottjehl: I think its timing related ... so for example I can't repro it now at will
[08:36:38] <kinblas_> scottjehl: but here's an interesting thing
[08:36:43] <scottjehl> this directHashChange part still doesn't sit well with me. Feels like we could find a way to keep all this in the same system.
[08:36:47] <scottjehl> feels fragile
[08:36:54] <kinblas_> scottjehl: the URL was correct, but it was showing the first-page of the app
[08:37:59] <_nickel_> kinblas: I'm in the process of downloading the ios sdk so I can use the simulator
[08:38:24] <kinblas> _nickel: heh that should take a while especially if you have to suck down the latest xcode with it
[08:38:39] <_nickel_> kinblas: I have an hour left :(
[08:39:01] * kinblas downloads ios7 beta
[08:39:34] <scottjehl> I'm gonna disable iOS5 scrolling and land it, FYI
[08:39:57] <scottjehl> if it's gonna be in 1.0, it's gotta go today, if disabled
[08:40:05] <_nickel_> kinblas: gseguin was saying he could reproduce the issue on ios4
[08:40:13] <scottjehl> what issue?
[08:40:21] <_nickel_> double back
[08:40:27] <scottjehl> dialogs? it's unrelated to IOS version
[08:40:41] <_nickel_> its just ios in general?
[08:40:44] <scottjehl> it's been present since pushState landed, in my tests this morning at least
[08:41:19] <scottjehl> I have a bad feeling it's going to be something we can't fix with changing pushState in some other browser
[08:42:23] <kinblas> _nickel: I think the bug is timing related, I just saw it in FF
[08:42:33] <kinblas> but can't repro it at will
[08:42:39] <scottjehl> kinblas - do you have any bandwidth to debug it?
[08:42:52] <scottjehl> or are you on pagebeforechange stuff now?
[08:43:01] <kinblas> scottjehl: not if you guys want docs and samples by 1pm est
[08:43:04] <kinblas> :-)
[08:43:26] <_nickel_> scottjehl: kinblas: I'd dive on it but I have the presentation tonight and I still have work to do on my slides :(
[08:43:28] <kinblas> of course this may be more important
[08:44:01] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[08:44:03] <kinblas> scottjehl: I'll start looking into it ... the most important thing is that we landed the changes for pagebeforechange
[08:44:10] <scottjehl> right
[08:44:12] <toddparker> so you had a demo working last night
[08:44:14] <kinblas> ok on it
[08:44:16] <scottjehl> I'll look at it now too
[08:44:21] <toddparker> so could you lightly docuemnt this and post that demo into teh docs
[08:44:24] <scottjehl> no harm in having many debug it at once
[08:44:45] <toddparker> it doesn't need to be super awesome, but i'd like to explain the basics
[08:44:59] <toddparker> after that, fixing the doubleback is our #1 priority
[08:45:22] <kinblas> toddparker: what directory should that go into?
[08:45:59] <kinblas> docs/pages/page-dynamic-sample-01.html ??
[08:47:30] <kinblas> toddparker: oh ok, so you want the docs *first* before helping to track down the bug?
[08:47:50] <toddparker> up to you
[08:48:02] <toddparker> i need both by mid afternoon my time
[08:48:13] <toddparker> but the dialog issue is most important
[08:48:35] <toddparker> yes, that demo page can do into docs/pages
[08:49:31] <toddparker> and you can create a page in the docs local nav called "Dynamic templated pages" or something like htat
[08:49:39] <toddparker> that can explain how to use the new hook
[08:49:59] <toddparker> can just be 2-3 paragraphs with come of the demo code highlighted
[08:50:03] <toddparker> super simple
[08:50:14] <toddparker> that help kinblas?
[08:53:57] <scottjehl> we could always blog next week about how to use the event
[08:55:10] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah ok
[08:55:37] <scottjehl> just fyi - removing the pushstate plugin fixes this in FF desktop
[08:55:45] <scottjehl> it's in there
[08:55:56] <kinblas> toddparker: I just didn't get a chance to do that other demo version scott wanted lastnight because I got side tracked by a bug that seemed IOS only ... but was releated to loading the first-page again (duplicating it)
[08:57:01] <scottjehl> I thought we got that bug recently?
[08:58:32] <gseguin> hi all
[09:00:00] <toddparker> kinblas: yeah, saw you got that one. nice.
[09:00:04] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[09:00:25] <toddparker> gseguin: do you have time now to help out or only later?
[09:00:40] <gseguin> now is good
[09:00:44] <toddparker> ok
[09:00:49] <gseguin> what can I do?
[09:00:59] <toddparker> so maybe kin could had off documenting the new event to you
[09:01:04] <toddparker> kinblas:
[09:01:21] <toddparker> that way kinblas and scottjehl  can work on the doubleback issue
[09:01:34] <toddparker> gseguin - you're very familiar with the new hook and how/why to use it
[09:01:59] <gseguin> the preventpagechange hook?
[09:02:09] <scottjehl> fyi https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7be8311d4e6a848ccef67348afd5fc48e10a12f3
[09:02:10] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery-mobile by scottjehl (3m, 15s ago): added location.search to the original page data-url
[09:09:23] <toddparker> yes gseguin
[09:09:46] <toddparker> kinblas - you there?
[09:10:10] <scottjehl> hey kinblas _nickel - naturally, this is a problem with nested lists too
[09:10:13] <scottjehl> not just dialogs
[09:10:20] <scottjehl> gen'd pages
[09:11:09] <_nickel_> scottjehl: you guys may already have spotted it but my guess is that the url is changing before the hashchange call in popstate has a chance to use it for comparison
[09:11:16] <_nickel_> scottjehl: or rather
[09:11:19] <_nickel_> it hasn't changed
[09:11:25] <scottjehl> sounds about right
[09:11:32] <scottjehl> doesn't happen in Chrome
[09:11:52] <_nickel_> thats causing the logic in there to spot a ui-dialog in the url and decide it needs to go back again
[09:11:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #30: STILL FAILING in 5 min 50 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/30/
[09:12:02] <scottjehl> oddly, it shouldn't happen in iOS4 either... but I guess replacestate is leaking in there even though we use hash
[09:12:27] <scottjehl> _nickel_ do you have time to look with us?
[09:12:44] <_nickel_> scottjehl: I'm trying to finish up my presentation for tonight
[09:12:52] <_nickel_> scottjehl: I don't have much left to do
[09:13:18] <_nickel_> scottjehl: when are we looking to release the next beta?
[09:13:22] <_nickel_> timewise?
[09:13:34] <scottjehl> freezing code in like 2 hours I think
[09:13:42] <_nickel_> yikes
[09:13:44] <_nickel_> alright
[09:13:46] <_nickel_> I'll take a look
[09:13:51] <_nickel_> still downloading the ios sdk
[09:14:13] <toddparker> sorry if you missed that nickel
[09:14:20] <toddparker> _nickel_ rather
[09:14:23] <_nickel_> toddparker: no I read the email
[09:14:30] <toddparker> I'd like to shoot for 2:30 EST
[09:14:35] <_nickel_> and that fits I was just double checkin
[09:14:38] <toddparker> that way, when we slip a bit, it's ok
[09:14:48] <_nickel_> the sdk should be done in about 15 minutes
[09:14:52] <toddparker> I have updated the docs in prep for B3
[09:14:55] <_nickel_> hopefully the install and boot will be easy
[09:14:56] <toddparker> and hte blog post is close
[09:15:11] <scottjehl> _nickel_ just test in FF desktop
[09:15:19] <scottjehl> reproducible ther e
[09:15:33] <toddparker> I just need to copy in the docs from the preventpagechange hook when it's done
[09:15:40] <toddparker> and we need to track down this dialog issue
[09:15:44] <toddparker> think that's it
[09:15:49] <toddparker> i miss anything?
[09:17:43] <scottjehl> hey kinblas _nickel_
[09:17:50] <scottjehl> line 77 of pushstate
[09:17:53] <_nickel_> scottjehl: looking at it now
[09:18:00] <scottjehl> we've got a setTimeout with no ms arg
[09:18:10] <_nickel_> scottjehl: that was the first thing to try
[09:18:14] <scottjehl> if I change it to 100
[09:18:15] <_nickel_> scottjehl: we can delay it longer if need be
[09:18:17] <scottjehl> seems ok
[09:18:24] <_nickel_> fragile :(
[09:18:51] <scottjehl> from what I see online, that arg appears to be required anyway. Do you commonly leave it out?
[09:19:12] <_nickel_> scottjehl: it defaults to 10ms or more in most browsers to my knowledge
[09:19:26] <_nickel_> the idea here being that we just want to defer until after the browser hashchange fires
[09:19:39] <_nickel_> whats the delay on Mr. Almans plugin
[09:19:41] <_nickel_> now that I think about it
[09:19:46] <_nickel_> when hashchange isn't supported
[09:19:50] <scottjehl> I've heard if you specify less than 15 it won't often be used, but still... I thought it was required to put something there
[09:20:15] <scottjehl> anyway... seems we need an arbitrary value here
[09:20:25] <scottjehl> 100 seems to be enough in desktop FF
[09:20:32] <scottjehl> we could try higher
[09:21:03] <_nickel_> scottjehl: does it work with say 10ms there?
[09:21:12] <scottjehl> didn't seem to be enough, no
[09:21:42] <_nickel_> scottjehl: yah
[09:21:45] <_nickel_> same result herer
[09:21:48] <_nickel_> *here
[09:22:20] <scottjehl> yep I'm seeing 100 fixes my iOS and FF
[09:22:37] * _nickel_ sighs
[09:22:56] <scottjehl> should we up it to 150 or 200 to account for slowness?
[09:23:12] <toddparker> nice find scottjehl
[09:23:16] <_nickel_> scottjehl: it would be good to find some sort of threshold
[09:23:23] <toddparker> timeouts are the solution to every problem
[09:23:24] <_nickel_> for ios
[09:23:34] * _nickel_ throws a stapler at toddparker
[09:23:40] <toddparker> are they like the duct tape of JS?
[09:23:40] <scottjehl> well what's the danger on the high end? hitting back again too quickly?
[09:23:53] <_nickel_> scottjehl: slow response
[09:24:02] <_nickel_> scottjehl: hitting back twice
[09:25:53] <scottjehl> so it seems like this timer isn't too dependent on response times or anything like that though, right? It's just making sure the hashchange event didn't fire on its own ya?
[09:26:50] <_nickel_> scottjehl: well no
[09:27:23] <_nickel_> scottjehl: the handleHashChange method cares about what the current url is
[09:27:29] <scottjehl> k before we discuss. Shall I commit this at 100 and then we can tweak and test further?
[09:27:31] <_nickel_> thats how it knows where it is vs where it came from
[09:27:51] <_nickel_> scottjehl: yah but I'm going to look into it a bit more
[09:28:20] <scottjehl> yep good. BTW Ben's timer doesn't apply here anyway, I don't think. Hashchange is native in pushState browsers
[09:29:19] <scottjehl> we just need to make sure we wait long enough to let those two events clear through, which is totally a guess I know... but we're not waiting on a hash poller
[09:29:36] <_nickel_> scottjehl: yah I'm wondering about older browsers
[09:29:40] <_nickel_> hmm
[09:29:42] <_nickel_> nevermind
[09:29:43] <kinblas> toddmparker: the first-page fix and the first sample I have is on the HEAD now
[09:29:47] <scottjehl> pushstate won't apply there
[09:29:47] <kinblas> toddmparker: sample is here:
[09:29:48] <kinblas> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dynamic-samples/sample-reuse-page.html
[09:29:55] <_nickel_> scottjehl: yap
[09:29:59] * _nickel_ is slow
[09:30:14] <scottjehl> think we're good. but we do need to understand why a good timeout is a good timeout
[09:30:17] <scottjehl> heh
[09:30:43] <toddparker> so now that scott put out that fire, what's on your plate kinblas
[09:30:48] <_nickel_> I'm still thinking its because the value of `to` in the hashchangehandler is not what we expect
[09:31:06] <kinblas> toddparker: writing the dynamic pages doc
[09:31:16] <scottjehl> Ideally, we'd bind to hashchange here and throw a flag that it fired as a result of the pop
[09:31:27] <scottjehl> but also have a timer to check that flag
[09:31:30] <kinblas> and then a new sample that scott wanted
[09:31:35] <toddparker> i think writing up a docs page explaining this feature is probably the most important thing to do now that  the dialog doubleback is fixed
[09:33:23] <gseguin> toddparker: should I go back to my collapsible issue?
[09:33:29] <toddparker> so you could maybe work on it with gseguin or he can take over?
[09:33:45] <toddparker> not sure...kinblas?
[09:34:11] <toddparker> gseguin: which collapsible issue (of the many)
[09:34:21] <kinblas> gseguin: you know PHP?
[09:34:45] <kinblas> gseguin: if you have time, I need a php script that dumps either json or html
[09:34:49] * gseguin looks for the issue #
[09:35:19] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1899
[09:35:20] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #1899 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (2m, 2w ago): Collapsible set (accordion): Cleanup
[09:35:44] <gseguin> kinblas: sorry don't know php
[09:35:47] <toddparker> cool. that is a good one. i think the ability to set the open one is a good one
[09:35:57] <toddparker> and the corner rounding
[09:36:02] <toddparker> the visual stuff may need to wait
[09:36:06] <toddparker>  we can break up this ticket
[09:36:09] <toddparker> if needed
[09:36:13] <kinblas> gseguin: ah ok ... I'll work on it after I do the basic docs
[09:36:21] <toddparker> sure, ok
[09:36:32] <gseguin> toddparker: that one I fixed already, just not pushed
[09:37:31] <scottjehl> kinblas - I think the thing I made before would do that for you
[09:37:38] <scottjehl> let's work together on this demo ya?
[09:37:44] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah sure
[09:37:56] <kinblas> oh yeah, you had a script on a branch
[09:38:02] <scottjehl> yep
[09:38:10] <scottjehl> lemme land ios5 scrolling first
[09:38:12] <scottjehl> then I'm on it
[09:42:02] <_nickel_> scottjehl: kinblas: the issue is that a hashchange if firing after the setTimeout in `onPopState`
[09:42:19] <scottjehl> k
[09:42:28] <_nickel_> the delay just makes sure that the hashchange fires before and runs into the `ignoreNextHashChange`
[09:42:37] <scottjehl> yeah.
[09:43:11] <scottjehl> seems like just enough delay to toss it to the end of the order of how that takes place here is alway we needed
[09:43:20] <scottjehl> however arbitrary
[09:43:24] <scottjehl> and I hate timeouts
[09:43:37] <kinblas> +1 on the hatin'
[09:43:47] <_nickel_> scottjehl: maybe an event fired at the end of the handleHashChange (or something similar) that we can bind to
[09:44:03] <_nickel_> since we have to ignore at aleast one hash change
[09:44:19] <_nickel_> seems event juggly
[09:44:26] * _nickel_ realizes that juggly is not a word
[09:44:30] <_nickel_> but it would be deterministic
[09:44:41] <scottjehl> yeah that sounds nice
[09:44:45] <scottjehl> but it doesn't always happen
[09:44:53] <scottjehl> still need a timer to check if it happened
[09:45:19] <_nickel_> scottjehl: we could just let the first hash change fire the event without changing the page
[09:45:30] <_nickel_> and then bind to that even to run our changepage
[09:45:39] <_nickel_> *event
[09:45:46] <_nickel_> scottjehl: I'll futz a bit
[09:46:01] <_nickel_> it doesn't have to land with b3
[09:46:31] <scottjehl> yep great
[09:46:46] <scottjehl> awesome. thanks for helping figure this out :)
[09:47:03] <_nickel_> scottjehl: sorry I missed this one, thats a doosie
[09:51:59] <scottjehl> We all missed it for weeks now :)
[10:00:24] <toddparker> http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ios5&aq=f
[10:05:48] <toddparker> so if cnet can have a bunch of iOS5 beta videos up on youtube, i guess showing a screencast of jQM running on the beta 5 emulator is ok?
[10:06:25] <_nickel_> toddparker: is there anyone we can contact at apple to ask
[10:06:26] <_nickel_> ?
[10:06:40] <_nickel_> I would be happy to hold ourselves to a higher standard than cnet :D
[10:06:57] <_nickel_> toddparker: and they may have gotten permission
[10:11:26] <toddparker> yeah
[10:11:35] <toddparker> kinblas: you know a person to ask
[10:11:46] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #31: STILL FAILING in 5 min 39 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/31/
[10:11:50] <toddparker> we just tried to do a screen cap and it was scrambled
[10:12:39] <_nickel_> sweet
[10:13:02] <_nickel_> the ios sdk I downloaded was for 10.6.6
[10:13:03] <_nickel_> ugh
[10:13:05] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah I was thinking lots of folks have already released videos of iOS5 ... especially the scrolling stuff
[10:14:13] <toddparker> thought so too
[10:14:14] <kinblas> _nickel_: ugh
[10:14:24] <toddparker> just don't want to get in trouble
[10:14:31] <toddparker> we sign an NDA
[10:15:08] <kinblas> toddmparker: can I pste some text on AIM so you can tell me if this is the level you guys want?
[10:19:03] <toddparker> 50
[10:19:12] <toddparker> oops, wrong window
[10:19:18] <toddparker> sure
[10:25:22] <scottjehl> screencast is processing on Vimeo
[10:32:17] <toddparker> woo hoo
[10:46:55] <scottjehl> k ios5 just landed
[10:47:01] <scottjehl> on HEAD
[10:47:19] <scottjehl> man, does that do a number on our transitions
[10:53:32] <kinblas> are we still meeting ... aka sucking up precious time before the release ... today?
[10:53:49] <kinblas> toddmparker: ^^^
[10:54:54] <scottjehl> hmm
[10:55:03] <scottjehl> maybe we should push through meeting time today?
[10:55:11] <scottjehl> kinblas I'd like to help you on that demo now
[10:55:28] <scottjehl> is the actual event change in master now?
[10:55:48] <kinblas> scottjehl: ok that would be cool ... I can't help but think someone is going to criticize us for documenting my first demo since it doesn't degrade very well
[10:55:57] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah
[10:56:19] <kinblas> scottjehl: the first demo I did is here:
[10:56:20] <kinblas> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dynamic-samples/sample-reuse-page.html
[10:56:38] <scottjehl> yep let's get on that. We can choose to document the one you've done externally, or as a secondary approach to one that supports all devices
[10:57:31] <scottjehl> http://vimeo.com/28776692
[11:03:17] <toddparker> so we can skip the meeting
[11:03:20] <toddparker> i'll just note that
[11:11:42] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #32: STILL FAILING in 5 min 35 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/32/
[11:11:59] <_nickel_> I'll take a look at that in a bit
[11:12:11] <scottjehl> _nickel_ we have failures?
[11:12:20] <scottjehl> not getting any emails
[11:12:27] <_nickel_> scottjehl: thats from the adobe ci server
[11:12:36] <_nickel_> scottjehl: there's been intermitent problems from what I can tell
[11:12:39] <scottjehl> k
[11:12:42] <_nickel_> disregard
[11:24:56] <toddparker> kinblas: did you commit the docs and demo yet?
[11:25:02] <toddparker>  I want to steal your content for the blog post
[11:25:10] <kinblas> toddparker: the demo is in
[11:25:14] <kinblas> I'm still working on the docs
[11:25:17] <toddparker> even just the first few pp's
[11:25:19] <kinblas> I can check in what I have so far?
[11:25:23] <toddparker> sure
[11:25:32] <toddparker> i don't need the step by step part
[11:28:18] <kinblas> toddparker: should be here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html
[11:33:43] <toddparker> thanks kinblas
[11:36:39] <toddparker> the link to the demo is broken
[11:36:56] <toddparker> missing the .html
[11:57:02] <kinblas> toddparker: what link?
[11:57:09] <kinblas> I didn't add any links to it yet
[11:57:11] <kinblas> doing that now
[11:57:22] <kinblas> we have to update *EVERY* page in that directory?
[12:01:50] <toddparker> :)
[12:01:55] <toddparker> yup
[12:02:10] <toddparker> we need to work on that
[12:02:15] <kinblas> uh yeah!
[12:02:19] <kinblas> :-)
[12:02:27] <toddparker> the link i was referring to was the link on teh decs page to the demo
[12:02:29] <kinblas> toddparker: so what's the title of the link?
[12:02:38] <kinblas> oh hmm let me see
[12:02:44] <toddparker> you also need to edit all the other pages in the folder to add this link
[12:04:05] <kinblas> toddparker: pushed fix
[12:04:26] <toddparker> cool
[12:04:37] <kinblas> toddparker: suggestions on wording for link?
[12:04:38] <toddparker> So you will need to add this page to the UL in the nav footer
[12:04:46] <kinblas> "Dynamic Page Injection"?
[12:04:52] <toddparker> Dynamic page templating?
[12:05:12] <toddparker> Templating pages dynamically
[12:05:27] <toddparker> verb-ing pages
[12:05:31] <kinblas> I hesitate only because
[12:05:37] <kinblas> there are no formal use of templates
[12:05:45] <toddparker> whatever is the most common thing
[12:05:53] <kinblas> toddparker: anyways, can you give that doc a read-through
[12:05:55] <toddparker> Dynamically building pages?
[12:05:58] <kinblas> feel free to change things
[12:06:18] <toddparker> looking good
[12:06:23] <toddparker> need to add some code tags
[12:06:34] <kinblas> toddparker: I did I used <pre><code>
[12:06:41] <kinblas> oh you mean on keywords in the doc?
[12:06:51] <toddparker> ya
[12:07:31] <kinblas> toddparker: You know in some of the other docs, there are words that are bolded and gi-normous
[12:07:37] <kinblas> is that what the <code> styling does?
[12:07:49] <kinblas> I found the size differences in some of the docs distracting
[12:08:11] <kinblas> but yeah, my doc looks like one monotonous wall of text
[12:09:03] <kinblas> toddparker: How about Dynamically Injecting Pages
[12:09:35] <toddparker> sure
[12:09:40] <toddparker> code just chances the font
[12:09:47] <toddparker> the bolder styles is code in a DL
[12:10:00] <toddparker> that helps when scanning a page for an option or methid
[12:10:15] <toddparker> yeah, adding some heading to break it up will help
[12:11:44] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #33: STILL FAILING in 5 min 37 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/33/
[12:11:47] <scottjehl> kinblas - I think we could change your existing demo up a bit to use real urls, maybe not even make a different one
[12:11:57] <scottjehl> for example
[12:12:18] <scottjehl> if we just made pages for Animals, colors, and vehicles
[12:12:19] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah I'd love that actually
[12:12:21] <kinblas> I feel dirty
[12:12:27] <scottjehl> GOOD.
[12:12:28] <scottjehl> hah
[12:12:40] <kinblas> anyways the goal of the page was to mimc Jive
[12:12:57] <kinblas> that's their url scheme so the good news is we can support them without any hacks
[12:13:10] <scottjehl> that's fantastic
[12:13:17] <kinblas> scottjehl: you want to take a crack at it?
[12:13:18] <scottjehl> yeah let's see here
[12:13:23] <scottjehl> okay I'll add the pages
[12:13:58] <kinblas> feel free to re-write whatever
[12:14:06] <kinblas> I'm updating the links to point to that page
[12:14:26] <toddparker> that'll take a while
[12:14:30] <kinblas> scottjehl: no big egoes here so modify away ... I just want to make the deadline with something good
[12:15:16] <scottjehl> I'm not sure if this will be full-circle. I think I'll just keep the initial page JSON-driven
[12:15:47] <scottjehl> the other pages wouldn't have all that in the head if you refresh.Unless you think it'd work well reproduced
[12:16:20] <kinblas> scottjehl: well I was going to make a php script that did produce a full blown jqm page
[12:16:32] <kinblas> so that a reload or whatever would look good
[12:16:38] <kinblas> (not just a frag I mean)
[12:16:40] <scottjehl> yeah this would still do that
[12:16:44] <scottjehl> just static pages
[12:16:54] <kinblas> heh  was also thinking of doing statics
[12:17:05] <kinblas> then just having a php that switched between json statics and html statics
[12:17:10] <kinblas> based on an arg
[12:17:26] <kinblas> category.php?output=json
[12:17:34] <scottjehl> no need for the ?
[12:17:42] <kinblas> category.php?output=json&id=color
[12:17:44] <scottjehl> x-requested-with header
[12:17:52] <scottjehl> ajax vs http
[12:17:54] <kinblas> that's presumptious
[12:17:55] <kinblas> :-)
[12:18:05] <scottjehl> how so?
[12:18:34] <kinblas> I just meant assuming that someone just wants json if xmlhttp
[12:18:50] <kinblas> I may want to use  the default jqm HTML handling
[12:19:10] <scottjehl> if page FOO is requested via ajax, in the site I'm building, I can make that decision though, right?
[12:19:21] <scottjehl> I mean, I could cover all bases
[12:19:26] <kinblas> anyways, was mimic'ing apis like yahoo where you tack on an output type and it changes what you get
[12:19:32] <scottjehl> this is for custom implementations right?
[12:19:36] <kinblas> lol
[12:19:39] <kinblas> yeah I know
[12:19:56] <scottjehl> animals.json ftw
[12:19:59] <scottjehl> ;)
[12:21:00] <scottjehl> refreshing a page after a change to foo?output=json would result in data output wouldn't it?
[12:21:12] <kinblas> right
[12:21:13] <scottjehl> I was thinking same url, diff access mechanisms
[12:21:20] <kinblas> oh ok
[12:21:22] <kinblas> I was thinking
[12:21:28] <scottjehl> we could build a large wooden badger
[12:21:38] <kinblas> sample that showed how to load a different url but still use the original
[12:21:42] <toddparker> ok, blog post is done
[12:21:56] <toddparker> tell me when you guys are done and ready to roll
[12:22:00] * kinblas marvels at how toddparker is able to write so fast
[12:22:07] <toddparker> copy paste
[12:22:19] <kinblas> gift-of-verbal-spewage
[12:22:29] <toddparker> thanks, spewage
[12:22:33] <kinblas> toddparker: but you tie it up so well
[12:22:37] <toddparker> heh
[12:22:41] <toddparker> thanks kinblas
[12:22:46] <kinblas> so the menus on the left
[12:22:50] <kinblas> of these docs pages
[12:22:52] <kinblas> are they injected?
[12:23:07] <kinblas> or are they the "More" list at the bottom of the files?
[12:23:31] <toddparker> they are the more at the bottom
[12:23:49] <kinblas> ah ok
[12:24:14] <scottjehl> or left, if you widen that window ;)
[12:24:29] <scottjehl> just saw you said that already
[12:24:36] <scottjehl> I need sleep
[12:25:56] <scottjehl> doesn't look like /docs/api/events.html has pagechange and pagebeforechange doc'd yet
[12:34:42] <_nickel_> scottjehl: kinblas: how can I help I finished my presentation
[12:34:44] <_nickel_> docs
[12:34:46] <_nickel_> whatever
[12:34:51] <_nickel_> "finished"
[12:34:59] <_nickel_> means its good enough for this evenign
[12:36:15] <kinblas> _nickel_: just doing some loose-ends for the dynamic pages stuff ... scottjehl is tweaking the sample to degrade a bit more gracefully
[12:36:24] <kinblas> I'm off to documenting vmouse stuff if we have time
[12:36:30] <_nickel_> kk
[12:36:35] <kinblas> _nickel_ did you document pushstate stuff?
[12:36:41] <_nickel_> should I just keep working on the evented solution to our hashchange problem?
[12:36:46] <_nickel_> kinblas: yah its in there
[12:36:59] <_nickel_> under ajax nav
[12:37:07] <_nickel_> all feedback is welcome
[12:37:45] <scottjehl> hmm kinblas
[12:38:00] <kinblas> uh huh
[12:38:03] <scottjehl> is it possible if we're using internal data like this, that we don't even need to preventDefault?
[12:38:15] <kinblas> ??
[12:38:15] <scottjehl> just generate the page synchronously and let changepage keep going
[12:38:24] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah
[12:38:37] <kinblas> but it's bad form to block for a server
[12:38:39] <kinblas> call
[12:38:55] <kinblas> but for in-memory stuff yeah!
[12:38:56] <scottjehl> this isn't a server call though
[12:38:57] <scottjehl> yeah
[12:39:11] <scottjehl> hmm ok. so we need to do this one demo, then another that uses external JSON
[12:39:19] <kinblas> I tried to sneak some other tidbits into the docs about stuff like that
[12:39:23] <kinblas> yeah
[12:39:38] <kinblas> btw: the data passed into the callback is *LIVE*
[12:39:38] <scottjehl> get the toPage, send a $.getJSON(), preventD, handle internally
[12:39:44] <kinblas> if you change the toPage or any options
[12:39:48] <kinblas> and let changepage continue
[12:39:53] <kinblas> it will use the new stuff
[12:39:57] <kinblas> so you can use for redirects
[12:40:04] <kinblas> etc
[12:40:44] <kinblas> notifications/observers/delegation very powerful
[12:40:47] <kinblas> :-)
[12:41:20] <kinblas> I need to grab a bite before the cafeteria closes, or runs out of food
[12:41:26] <kinblas> be back in a few minutes
[12:48:26] <toddparker> gotta wrap it up folks
[12:48:44] <toddparker> 10 minutes, then pencils down!
[12:49:46] <kinblas> toddparker: did you read the doc? Just want to make sure I didn't say anything confusing or wrong
[12:51:23] <_nickel_> kinblas: downloading now
[12:53:05] <toddparker> it read nicely to me
[12:54:17] <toddparker> are you working on the formatting
[12:54:24] <toddparker> code, headings?
[12:54:31] <toddparker> not a biggie
[12:56:26] <toddparker> just noticed the the leftnav should be initial cap for this
[12:56:30] <toddparker> again, no biggie
[12:56:40] <toddparker> i'd like ot add more docs like this
[12:56:41] <toddparker> good stuff
[12:59:51] <scottjehl> ok kinblas
[13:00:02] <scottjehl> data-driven-with-fallback is the branch name
[13:00:17] <scottjehl> it's like 90% there. the url was still using a hash. not sure why
[13:00:23] <kinblas> toddparker: we don't actually distribute the docs right? Just github?
[13:00:25] <scottjehl> wanna take a look?
[13:00:30] <scottjehl> I gotta run!
[13:00:33] <kinblas> scottjehl sure, let me pull
[13:00:39] <kinblas> scottjehl: for the day?
[13:00:45] <scottjehl> nice work guys - dr appt
[13:00:48] <scottjehl> back in hours
[13:00:52] <scottjehl> later on :)
[13:00:54] <kinblas> slacker
[13:00:56] <scottjehl> land if it's ready
[13:00:59] <kinblas> heh just kidding
[13:01:15] <toddparker> yeah, kin give that a look and pull if you like
[13:01:16] <scottjehl> if not, dunno maybe we should pull the demo page and add it post-B3?
[13:01:19] <scottjehl> up to you!
[13:01:31] <scottjehl> if we keep, it probably needs a support disclaimer
[13:01:50] <toddparker> ii agree about the disclaimer
[13:01:53] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: probably post b3 ... that's why i was asking above
[13:01:54] <toddparker> can you add that kin
[13:02:04] <kinblas> we don't distribute it, we just tag it right?
[13:02:13] <toddparker> distribute how?
[13:02:21] <kinblas> zip
[13:02:24] <toddparker> it's part of the zip
[13:02:45] <kinblas> oh so there is a zip
[13:02:48] <toddparker> yep
[13:02:50] * kinblas is clueless
[13:02:59] <kinblas> so this disclaimer
[13:03:06] <kinblas> for the sample I wrote or in scotts branch?
[13:03:26] <toddparker> the data url in scott's demo looks like a local id rather than a path so it's not geting pushstate'd
[13:03:32] <toddparker> you can update if you like
[13:03:45] <toddparker> the sample you wrote
[13:03:59] <toddparker> it should say, this won't work on c grade browsers
[13:04:22] <kinblas> toddparker: can I add it to the last paragraph where I mention that it does not degrade gracefully?
[13:04:28] <toddparker> sure
[13:04:33] <kinblas> what is C-grade anyways? No JS?
[13:04:36] <toddparker> deep-linking won't work
[13:04:38] <toddparker> too
[13:04:41] <toddparker> yeah
[13:04:50] <toddparker> no js or not worthy of enhancement
[13:04:55] <toddparker> (no media query support)
[13:05:25] <kinblas> toddparker: so at the bottom I already say
[13:05:26] <kinblas> "That's the sample in a nutshell. It should be noted that this particular sample and its usage is not a very good example of an app that degrades gracefully when JavaScript is turned off. We will be posting other examples that demonstrate how to degrade gracefully in the future."
[13:05:58] <toddparker> so do you think we could add a link to scott's demo
[13:06:08] <toddparker> this is way too much churn for 4:00!
[13:06:14] <toddparker> shesh
[13:06:14] <kinblas> toddparker: I know
[13:06:19] <kinblas> that's why I'm saying punt
[13:06:22] <kinblas> we can land it after we tag
[13:06:43] <kinblas> I know we're constrained by John R.'s time
[13:06:59] <toddparker> scott's not gonna be happy
[13:07:06] <toddparker> but this is tight
[13:07:17] <toddparker> did you look at his branch?
[13:07:28] <kinblas> toddparker: uh no, we're busy talkin' :-P
[13:07:31] <toddparker> just wonder if we could link to his demo alognside yours
[13:07:55] <toddparker> after that disclaimer, have a link pointing to his demo witha  setup
[13:08:11] <toddparker> give it a look
[13:08:17] <kinblas> sure, but I'm not sure what the state of the demo is
[13:08:19] <kinblas> hang on pulling it
[13:08:22] <toddparker> k
[13:08:36] <toddparker> he said it needed that one tweak above
[13:08:37] <kinblas> damn is that branch name long enough? :-)
[13:08:42] <toddparker> heh
[13:11:41] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #34: STILL FAILING in 5 min 34 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/34/
[13:14:45] <toddparker> kinblas: verdict?
[13:17:58] <kinblas> toddparker: it just seems like we should externalize it all
[13:18:07] <kinblas> I can see why it's using the hash
[13:19:16] <kinblas> toddparker: So what I'm wondering is this
[13:21:13] <toddparker> yesssss
[13:26:00] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm not sure if this is just a problem on the branch (not sure what code the branch was started with) but hitting the back button isn't bringing me back to the initial page
[13:26:20] <toddparker> the data url in scott's demo looks like a local id rather than a path so it's not geting pushstate'd
[13:26:21] <kinblas> toddparker: I did manage to fix the has problem though
[13:26:27] <toddparker> is that it?
[13:26:31] <kinblas> I fixed that
[13:26:34] <toddparker> ok, cool
[13:26:41] <kinblas> but the back button still isn't working right
[13:26:45] <toddparker> hmmm
[13:26:48] <toddparker> odd
[13:26:58] <kinblas> oh I know why
[13:27:12] <toddparker> what if you linked to his page at the end, but have a hard link to /test/
[13:27:18] <kinblas> it's because when we hit the back button scott is looking for any file that is a .html
[13:27:20] <toddparker> so we can update that page on the sly
[13:27:25] <toddparker> not in the zip, but hey
[13:27:28] <kinblas> including the application page which doesn't work
[13:27:33] <toddparker> right
[13:27:56] <kinblas> toddparker: actually that's what I was going to say earlier
[13:28:01] <kinblas> when I left you hanging
[13:28:34] <kinblas> how's about we put verbage at the end that says check back on the HEAD version of this page for more samples in the futre.
[13:28:37] <kinblas> future
[13:28:42] <kinblas> and then we can tinker with this tonight
[13:28:48] <kinblas> and push something that works
[13:28:53] <kinblas> and is a little more real-world
[13:29:45] <toddparker> that's why I think we can push this now but just link to it at the end
[13:29:56] <toddparker> and have that link be an absolute link to /test/
[13:29:59] <toddparker> so we cna update it
[13:31:12] <kinblas> toddparker: but he over-wrote my original demo file
[13:31:19] <kinblas> I need to make it a different file
[13:31:21] <toddparker> ah
[13:31:24] <kinblas> hang on a sec and then I'll check it in
[13:31:26] <toddparker> yeah, keep both
[13:31:28] <kinblas> on the HEAD
[13:33:06] <toddparker> great
[13:33:16] <toddparker> can you edit the page and push that too
[13:38:19] <toddparker> just say when this is ready to roll
[13:39:17] <kinblas> toddparker
[13:39:30] <kinblas> should there be a dynamic-samples/index.html that we point to?
[13:39:35] <kinblas> or just scott's demo?
[13:40:45] <toddparker> both is ok sicne scott's doesn't matchyour narrative
[13:41:34] <toddparker> or does it?
[13:42:38] <toddparker> i'd say just do whatever will wrap this is right now :)
[13:42:53] <kinblas> ok
[13:45:33] <toddparker> thanks kinblas
[13:46:04] <gseguin> scottjehl: ping
[13:46:46] <kinblas> toddparker: landing it
[13:47:10] <toddparker> sweet!
[13:48:25] <kinblas> toddparker: ok that was stressful .. it's in
[13:48:36] <toddparker> thanks!
[13:49:52] <kinblas> toddparker: btw, scott's samples are on the HEAD too
[13:49:59] <kinblas> we still need to fix it up I think
[13:50:04] <kinblas> to externalize everything
[13:50:24] <toddparker> looks great
[13:50:35] <toddparker> i like this plan. /test/ is our friend
[13:51:41] <kinblas> toddparker: so I still haven't added <code> etc to that doc
[13:52:01] <kinblas> toddparker: and I'm about to go into a 1.5 hour meeting
[13:52:04] <kinblas> at 2pm
[13:52:13] <toddparker> ok
[13:52:17] <toddparker> i think we're all set
[13:52:20] * kinblas feels like a half-arse
[13:52:25] <toddparker> appreciate all the work during the craziness
[13:52:26] <kinblas> so rushed toda
[13:52:28] <toddparker> heh
[13:52:32] <toddparker> i know
[13:52:35] <toddparker> we never learn
[13:52:39] <kinblas> what release isn't?
[13:52:40] <kinblas> :-)
[13:53:40] <_nickel_> at least now we can focus on bugs until the end of september
[13:53:44] <_nickel_> no new features please :)
[13:54:08] <toddparker> none at all
[13:54:13] <toddparker> bug fixes galore!
[13:54:30] <toddparker> this release adds some badass stuff
[13:54:42] <gseguin> toddparker: style/naming question
[13:54:52] <_nickel_> indeed
[13:55:06] <gseguin> why is the top class for collapsible ui-collapsible-contain
[13:55:13] <gseguin> and not ui-collapsible
[13:56:04] <gseguin> any good reason for that?
[13:58:19] <toddparker> is that the container around the header and contents?
[13:58:32] <toddparker> i'd need to look gseguin
[13:58:42] <toddparker> actually, could you email scott with q's
[13:58:49] <toddparker> he'd be the best person to ask
[14:01:02] <gseguin> yep, I'll email him
[14:01:08] <toddparker> thanks!
[14:07:04] <toddparker> getting the site ready to launch
[14:15:34] <gseguin> w00t! Congrats guys!
[14:15:51] <toddparker> woo hoo!!!
[14:15:59] <toddparker> blog post and site updates are a GO!
[14:16:04] <toddparker> nice work you guys
[14:16:16] <toddparker> this is a kick ass final beta. good stuff in there
[14:16:26] <toddparker> now to fix those 400 bugs...
[14:19:13] <_nickel_> toddparker: scottjehl: kinblas_: finally getting some lunh
[14:19:15] <_nickel_> *lunch
[14:19:24] <toddparker> heh, sorry about the madness
[14:19:35] <_nickel_> toddparker: I've been a slacker today
[14:19:40] <_nickel_> mostly working on my presentation
[14:19:43] <_nickel_> still need to eat though

[14:57:29] <toddparker> we need to fix up the comment formatting on the blog. looks terrible
[14:58:01] <eddiemonge> toddparker:
[14:58:08] <eddiemonge> oops meant to type stuff there
[14:58:11] <toddparker> hi eddiemonge
[14:58:35] <toddparker> would you have time to tidy up the comment form and display?
[14:59:01] <eddiemonge> whoa,
[14:59:05] <toddparker> normalize the font sizes, remove that green border, etc.
[14:59:06] <eddiemonge> did that change recently?
[14:59:11] <toddparker> looks like crapola
[14:59:18] <toddparker> no, it's always been pretty bad
[14:59:23] <toddparker> it was never styled
[14:59:40] <toddparker> also, do you know how i can edit the global css?
[14:59:56] <toddparker> i always have to hack stuff with inline styles on pages. rather do it right
[15:00:10] <toddparker> wacky formatting on those comments
[15:01:29] <eddiemonge> yeah, i can fix it tonight
[15:01:44] <eddiemonge> especially since i may have just broked the backend temporarily
[15:03:01] <toddparker> was just going to say it is broken now
[15:03:25] <toddparker> crap. the video is gone from the blog post
[15:03:29] <toddparker> and i can't edit it now
[15:04:08] <toddparker> i appreciate you looking into this eddiemonge
