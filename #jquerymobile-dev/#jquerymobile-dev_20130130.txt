[04:50:30] <toddmparker_> ha, so I'm an idiot huh uGoMobi 
[04:50:31] <bot-t> (2 hours 10 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell toddmparker_: the new icon sprites are ~64Kb :( 
[04:50:31] <bot-t> (2 hours 5 mins 0 sec ago) <uGoMobi> tell toddmparker_ : Re: .no-disc .ui-icon { background-color: transparent; } >>> good idea! classname .ui-icon-nodisc ?
[04:50:42] <toddmparker_> wrong icon name. classic.
[04:50:50] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker_ 
[04:50:55] <uGoMobi> those are your words :)
[04:50:56] <toddmparker_> hey uGoMobi 
[04:51:13] <toddmparker_> yeah, i like the idea of just backing that class name into the css as an opt-in
[04:51:24] <toddmparker_> your name seems to good to me
[04:51:31] <uGoMobi> yeah simple but effective
[04:51:42] <toddmparker_> i feel like having a few extra classes is worth it for convenience
[04:51:58] <toddmparker_> just don't want to add to the api
[04:52:04] <uGoMobi> i agree
[04:52:05] <toddmparker_> classes are freebies
[04:52:24] <toddmparker_> new sprites are huge again?!
[04:52:27] <toddmparker_> grr
[04:52:39] <toddmparker_> we should run them thru png crush or something similiar
[04:52:41] <uGoMobi> would be nice if shadow and corners would work in the same way at some point
[04:52:50] <toddmparker_> agreed
[04:52:52] <toddmparker_> 1.4
[04:53:32] <toddmparker_> we may be able to keep back compat by scoping to either [data=shadow] or .shadow
[04:53:39] <toddmparker_> either way, it's just a selector, no js
[04:54:14] <uGoMobi> yes
[04:54:35] <toddmparker_> that's my plan for 1.4 
[04:54:39] <uGoMobi> or we make the JS apply the class the same way you would do it manually
[04:54:46] <uGoMobi> until we can remove it from the JS
[04:54:51] <toddmparker_> keep the old api but start moving towards classes for class things
[04:54:56] <toddmparker_> right
[04:55:25] <toddmparker_> so if you use the data-, we add the class
[04:55:31] <toddmparker_> that's fine too
[04:55:47] <toddmparker_> i can't wait to start working thru all this with you
[04:55:56] <uGoMobi> same here
[04:56:06] <uGoMobi> really want to simplefy things
[04:56:13] <toddmparker_> once we get 1.3 and the new demos out, we can start ripping everything apart
[04:56:13] <uGoMobi> more CSS, less JS
[04:56:38] <toddmparker_> ideally, we'd be closer to bootstrap where we use a lot more css and less js
[04:56:39] <uGoMobi> also for the hover and focus stuff
[04:56:42] <toddmparker_> yep
[04:57:22] <toddmparker_> so what outstanding issues do we have for 1.3 at this point?
[04:57:25] <toddmparker_> (brb)
[05:02:48] <uGoMobi> I am finishing the grid listview demo now and will work on fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5510 today
[05:03:18] <uGoMobi> then we still have the iOS popup issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5523
[05:04:44] <uGoMobi> and I was wondering if we could do something about the Page title vs. data-title on initial page load issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2865
[05:05:03] <uGoMobi> it had milestone 1.2.1 but I changed it to 1.3
[05:05:28] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi: toddmparker_: _|Nix|_:
[05:05:41] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:06:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this looks potentially like trouble! https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5559
[05:13:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you think it might affect other things than the custom select?
[05:14:02] <arschmitz> yes there is already another issue on it from same person
[05:14:09] <arschmitz> its anything with href="#"
[05:14:29] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5558
[05:14:30] <uGoMobi> also Win 8 or WP?
[05:14:35] <arschmitz> surface
[05:14:59] <arschmitz> so win8 rt
[05:15:10] <uGoMobi> right
[05:15:31] <arschmitz> i wish we had a real device to test this
[05:15:41] <arschmitz> because this could be a really big issue
[05:16:08] <arschmitz> will kill closing popups and dialogs
[05:16:24] <arschmitz> could potentially effect slider handles
[05:16:25] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:16:43] <arschmitz> im sure other stuff im not thinking of too but thats enough lol
[05:17:48] <uGoMobi> have to see if this is only win8 rt or win8 in general
[05:18:09] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:18:14] <arschmitz> either way not good though
[05:18:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you have think both issues have same cause so we should close one as duplicate?
[05:18:47] <arschmitz> probably sounds like anything with a # for href causes it
[05:20:44] <arschmitz> custome selects inject an <a href="#"
[05:23:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: gota run for now but ill be back in a bit
[05:23:34] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:32:15] <toddmparker_> I really need to buy that surface!
[05:34:29] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: getting those two items buttoned up today would be great. The title issue is a nice to have if it turns out to be more work. #5510 is a biggie
[05:34:55] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: do you have time to look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5523 today?
[05:35:21] <toddmparker_> I'd like to get that fixed up because it's really distracting on iOS6
[05:35:53] <toddmparker_> think we're in good shape for RC by Monday for sure
[06:03:18] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: just re-compressed the icons. saved 100k PER SPRITE

[06:03:34] <toddmparker_> now they are 2k and 4k for the two sizes 
[06:03:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: oh nice!
[06:03:42] <toddmparker_> pngcrush is awesome
[06:03:53] <toddmparker_> double check for me
[06:03:58] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:04:00] <toddmparker_> sizes, that things still look ok
[06:04:19] <toddmparker_> my finder insists they are still 114k but in preview, it tells me the right size
[06:04:53] <toddmparker_> 1.92k - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/c033ee0057248193b4c355d0556b1fde0a6faaab/css/themes/default/images/icons-18-black.png

[06:05:31] <toddmparker_> heading off to work...be back on later
[06:09:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I'm looking at it.
[06:09:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: they are 2k and 4k now... looks good on both SD and HD
[06:09:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Is there a way to tell whether the input method is open on iOS?
[06:09:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: menu/bars icon looks great now too
[06:09:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: It thrashes around a whole lot more when the input method is open.
[06:14:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/5519.html and open the popup, focus the first input and go to landscape.
[06:14:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: It repositions the popup twice, for some reason ...
[06:15:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OTOH, if you open http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/docs/pages/popup/index.html and open the "Form" example and focus on the first input and rotate to landscape it doesn't do that.
[06:15:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Very weird.
[06:15:48] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[06:15:48] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1196: FIXED in 12 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1196/
[06:15:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Increasing the timeout doesn't help either ...
[06:16:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I'd love to be able to totally turn off the resize logic while the input method is open, even if I get an orientationchange, because I believe the input method will handle the repositioning.
[06:17:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Currently, my logic sometimes causes the focused input to move off-screen so you can't see what you're typing.
[06:22:08] <_|Nix|_> There does not appear to be a way to determine whether the keyboard is up or not.
[06:26:52] <_|Nix|_> Man, it appears that, when switching to landscape, the appearance of the popup can itself cause a resize event. WTF ?!
[06:35:09] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: i don't think there is a way to know if the keyboard is open
[06:35:17] <toddmparker_> but it only opens when an input has focus
[06:35:21] <toddmparker_> so there's that
[06:35:57] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: yeah, i re-drew the 18px bars, grid and pushed some pixels
[06:36:06] <toddmparker_> ok, be on in a bit
[06:36:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK ... I have /something/ ... I'll push it and you tell me if it's good enough ... I really can't tell anymore ...
[06:36:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Hope it doesn't break Android et. al. 
[06:37:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: The popup on that test page still flashes twice for some reason ... 
[06:37:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ... when you rotate to landscape ... but not when you rotate back to portrait ... *sigh* ... st00pid iOS *wave*
[06:58:02] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I give up ... this bl00dy popup still blinks ... I'll use another setTimeout ... basically, I'll ignore all resize events for, like, a second ...
[07:16:02] <_|Nix|_> Man ... insanity ... another setTimeout ... 1000 no less :(
[07:16:44] <_|Nix|_> ... and still I get double-blinks with that st00pid test popup when going to landscape while the input method is open ... triple-blinks even ...
[07:21:48] <_|Nix|_> Oh, cool ... event loop ... I hooked up to throttledresize instead of resize, and now, when I show the popup in landscape, it causes a resize, which causes me to hide the popup, which later results in my showing the popup, which causes a resize, which causes me to resize the popup, which ...
[07:22:09] <_|Nix|_> s/resize the popup/hide the popup/
[07:22:23] <_|Nix|_> Insanity ...
[07:23:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: by input method you mean the keyboard right?
[07:24:11] <arschmitz> or numberpad select menu etc...
[07:25:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[07:25:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry ... Nokia lingo.
[07:25:49] <arschmitz> well that opens when a text or number input or select recieves focus
[07:26:07] <arschmitz> so couldnt you just say in one of those has focus to tell if something is open
[07:26:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't get it. When you open the popup on http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/5519.html, focus on the second input, and rotate to landscape, the popup blinks, like, three times!
[07:26:47] <arschmitz> only on ios6 though right?
[07:26:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I already have it set up to ignore resize events for a second and a half after the popup opens, or after anything is focused.
[07:27:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't have other iOS to test, so I dunno ...
[07:27:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you open that page on your iDevices?
[07:27:43] <arschmitz> im checking
[07:28:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I hope all the natting that points 8080 to my laptop is still in place ... had an outage last night.
[07:28:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: By ignoring resize events upon focusin, I've gotten focus switching to be nice and smooth. However, orientationchange is an unmitigated disaster.
[07:28:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Correction - orientationchange while the keyboard is open.
[07:29:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You get more resize events 'n you can shake a stick at.
[07:30:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I get the distinct impression that putting the popup back on the screen itself causes resize events, for some reason.
[07:30:38] <arschmitz> cant open that page
[07:30:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bah ... can't reach the port?
[07:32:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Fixing it ... I think I'm missing an iptables rule ...
[07:33:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, fsck! I reset my router :(
[07:33:33] <arschmitz> lame
[07:35:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you please try again?
[07:36:57] <arschmitz> ok
[07:37:10] <arschmitz> works now
[07:37:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[07:37:53] <arschmitz> looks fine on ios5
[07:38:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: orientationchange with keyboard open?
[07:38:18] <arschmitz> execpt the popup is completely transparent
[07:38:23] <arschmitz> yup
[07:38:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: that's intentional. I had a "console" behind it.
[07:38:55] <arschmitz> ok
[07:39:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For some reason iOS 6.0.1 messes with AJAX ... I had an AJAX console.log replacement, but, for some reason, it stops sending the console.log after a while :(
[07:39:30] <arschmitz> weird
[07:39:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Too many requests back to the server or whatever.
[07:41:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, fsck! On Android 2.3.5, rotating to landscape with the kb open is a disaster ... it keeps on blinking ...
[07:42:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But only on orientationchange ...
[07:43:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I think if I fix the iOS multi-blinks, I may end up fixing the Android perma-blinks ...
[07:43:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: On Android, the blinking stops if you tap previous/next to focus another input.
[07:44:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I know what I'll do ... I'll ignore resize events right after I've repositioned the popup once ...
[07:46:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This solution is about as solid as a house of cards floating on a dingy in the middle of a hurricane. It's a coherent pure quantum state inside a smelting furnace.
[07:50:13] <_|Nix|_> Boo-yah! Much more solid.
[07:50:48] <_|Nix|_> Now, it's about as long-lived as a butterfly in a thermonuclear blast. Yaaay!
[08:01:38] <arschmitz> lol

[08:49:59] <uGoMobi> even more excited to go to BB Jam next week
[09:06:16] <gseguin> RWhitbeck: you want talk about the builder?
[09:07:44] <RWhitbeck> gseguin sure.  On a call now though. 
[09:07:57] <gseguin> alright ping me when you're available
[09:08:01] <RWhitbeck> ok
[09:09:29] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/qw-frA

[09:16:12] <gnarf> is rxaviers hiding here too - cc him on your DB convos? :)
[09:18:19] <rxaviers> ;) feel free to ping me
[09:32:06] <gseguin> gnarf: will do. /cc rxaviers 
[10:20:58] <toddmparker> hey all
[10:32:18] <gseguin> hey toddmparker 
[11:45:53] <RWhitbeck> gseguin you want to chat now about builder?
[12:14:58] <gseguin> RWhitbeck: back from lunch
[12:15:11] <gseguin> RWhitbeck: what do you wanna know?
[12:15:17] <RWhitbeck> crap I knew I forgot something today
[12:15:23] <RWhitbeck> Lunch 
[12:15:32] <gseguin> :)
[12:16:36] <RWhitbeck> Sure so not sure how we want to do the download page on the new site.  toddmparker was saying a downloads page that included the download builder like ui is doing.  
[12:17:00] <gseguin> that sounds good
[12:17:14] <gseguin> it's pretty easy to generate the UI 
[12:17:34] <RWhitbeck> So is that just laying out the form elements from the existing page and just submitting it to a special page on the back end?
[12:18:08] <gseguin> It gets a json object that depends on the version selected 
[12:18:21] <gseguin> and with that it generates the right checkboxes
[12:19:04] <gnarf> we actually generate the html in UI i think
[12:19:06] <gnarf> cc rxaviers
[12:19:26] <rxaviers> oh oh guys, Im about to leave
[12:19:27] <gseguin> then it does a get with a bunch of options set by the checked checkboxes to a different url to generate the custom build
[12:19:50] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure that jqueryui.com repo sources it out to the download.jqueryui.com repo: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/blob/master/grunt.js#L42-L94
[12:20:37] <gseguin> rxaviers: that's cool, we'll get you tomorrow if there are questions for you
[12:21:12] <gnarf> i mean, you could continue with the ajax loading of the options too
[12:21:22] <gnarf> if i understood that
[12:21:31] <RWhitbeck> gseguin is this something that I can hand off to you and I can help with content, etc.  Seems like you have a good handle on it and it's just coordinating with gnarf?
[12:21:54] <rxaviers> yeap, we generate the html using download.jqueryui.com
[12:22:24] <gseguin> RWhitbeck: yup I can take care of it but I'm not a designer
[12:22:50] <rxaviers> this is the grunt task that takes the output of the generated html and deploy into WP https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/blob/master/grunt.js#L42
[12:23:00] <RWhitbeck> either am I … I think if we can get it functional we can pull in the designers to help out. 
[12:23:15] <gseguin> RWhitbeck: sounds good
[12:23:37] <rxaviers> (actually to deploy we `grunt deploy`)
[12:23:46] <gseguin> rxaviers: thanks, I think I like the dynamic generation, that allows us to build master or other branches
[12:24:30] <rxaviers> ok guys gd luck there, just let me know if I can help
[12:24:39] <gseguin> rxaviers: will do!
[12:24:42] * rxaviers about to leave
[13:11:15] <gseguin> johnbender: which versions of jQuery do we explicitely test against?
[13:44:57] <johnbender> gseguin: you can see it in the output of the Old build
[13:45:08] <johnbender> + git + whatever is in the repo
[13:47:09] <gseguin> johnbender: How do the navigation tests even work ?
[13:47:29] <gseguin> johnbender: They were all missing the requirejs config
[13:48:19] <johnbender> gseguin: the navigation/index tests?
[13:48:25] <gseguin> yeah
[13:48:29] <johnbender> they pull from js/ directly
[13:48:37] <gseguin> nope
[13:48:43] <johnbender> ?
[13:48:49] <gseguin> navigation/method/index.html
[13:48:59] <gseguin> navigation/event/index.html
[13:49:09] <gseguin> navigation/multipage/index.html
[13:49:18] <gseguin> all were missing the <script src="../../../../js/requirejs.config.js"></script>
[13:49:58] <johnbender> gseguin: they use the old async load
[13:50:03] <johnbender> I'm not sure what you mean
[13:50:08] <johnbender> why wouldn't they work
[13:50:15] <gseguin> oh wait, I know
[13:50:25] <gseguin> the problem doesn't happen in master
[13:50:29] <gseguin> nevermind
[13:50:37] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[13:50:43] <gseguin> it's just in grunt-0.4
[14:09:25] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... flooding much?
[14:11:16] <Wilto> I’m tellin’ y’all: it’s sabotage.
[14:12:21] <Wilto> How do we ban someone.
[14:14:14] <gseguin> Wilto: you need to be a channel op
[14:14:25] <DaveMethvin> i'd do it but i'm not an op here
[14:14:29] <gseguin> then you use /kick the first time
[14:14:31] <Wilto> Paging ajpiano.
[14:15:08] <gseguin> ajpiano: could you op a few of the team members on #jquerymobile-dev ?
[14:15:16] <ajpiano> sure
[14:15:27] <gseguin> thanks!
[14:15:36] <ajpiano> gseguin: you don't auth with nickserv?
[14:15:46] <gseguin> hmm I though I did
[14:15:56] <Wilto> I’m excited to be drunk with power.
[14:16:00] <Wilto> Well. Drunker.
[14:16:04] <_|Nix|_> Seems like the flood might be over.
[14:16:05] <ajpiano> oh, you do, you just aren't right now
[14:16:14] <gseguin> I can op myself on #jquery-meeting 
[14:16:22] <gseguin> but not on #jquerymobile-dev 
[14:16:53] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: true but for the future so we don't bother ajpiano 
[14:18:23] <Wilto> You’ll never stop me from bothering ajpiano.
[14:18:27] <ajpiano> gseguin: Wilto DaveMethvin toddmparker http://cl.ly/image/2C0G0k1p0M1G
[14:18:37] <toddmparker> hey all. hanging out here with arschmitz 
[14:18:42] <gseguin> lol
[14:18:52] <toddmparker> adding some notes here as we go - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-planning
[14:19:03] <gseguin> thanks ajpiano 
[14:19:12] <DaveMethvin> it's in the way that you use it .. boy don't you know ... so don't you ever abuse it
[14:19:35] <toddmparker> thanks ajpiano 
[14:19:46] <toddmparker> nice DaveMethvin 
[14:20:00] <DaveMethvin> i banned him in -dev, that seems to have shut him up on all channels
[14:20:06] <DaveMethvin> even after unbanning
[14:21:12] <gseguin> ajpiano: <gseguin> op #jquerymobile-dev gseguin
[14:21:15] <gseguin> 15:20 -ChanServ(ChanServ@services.)- You are not authorized to perform this operation.
[14:21:22] <ajpiano> you aren't authed right now
[14:21:27] <gseguin> oh
[14:21:35] <gseguin> let me try that again
[14:22:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2865 requires us to establish an order of priorities for determining the title we shall display.
[14:25:00] <toddmparker> ok
[14:25:30] <gseguin> ajpiano: nickserv says I am
[14:25:45] <Wilto> Uh oh.
[14:26:56] <ajpiano> hmm gseguin :/
[14:27:37] <ajpiano> there we go
[14:27:52] <gseguin> great!
[14:28:03] <gseguin> thanks!
[14:28:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I see you sportin' that @
[14:30:17] <Wilto> lookin’ sharp
[14:30:54] <gseguin> heh :)
[14:33:50] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: in that issue, you suggest an order which makes sense
[14:35:42] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you were on this title issue too
[14:36:02] <toddmparker> trying to read all the issues to understand the holes in the logic
[14:36:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The scenarios I created have been fixed (presumably by the nav refactor).
[14:36:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I gave it look some time ago
[14:36:35] <toddmparker> so what are we missing?
[14:36:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What problem are you referring to in your latest comment?
[14:36:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I followed that link, but I dunno what to look for.
[14:37:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Talking about 
[14:37:16] <_|Nix|_> http://jsbin.com/onibuc/41
[14:37:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that is a single page with a title attribute and h1 in the header
[14:37:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the h1 is used as title
[14:37:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK.
[14:38:25] <uGoMobi> (and there is no data-title attribute)
[14:38:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: *sigh*, but if the same page were to be AJAX-ed in instead, then using the H1 would be OK, right?
[14:39:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no I don't think so
[14:39:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think with a single page we should always use the title attribute
[14:39:39] <uGoMobi> unless there is a data-title attribute
[14:40:05] <toddmparker> agreed
[14:40:44] <toddmparker> why is the h1 used there?
[14:41:23] <_|Nix|_> I'm not so sure. I tend to think that we should start out from the page, and move outwards into the document. Now, what uGoMobi is saying is exactly that, but the question is: Is <h1> allowed to substitute for data-title?
[14:41:58] <_|Nix|_> That is: do we consider <h*> as a source of title information at all?
[14:42:03] <_|Nix|_> s/do/should/
[14:42:46] <uGoMobi> I think only in case of a multipage template and only use the h1 if there is no data-title attr
[14:44:01] <toddmparker> Ah, I see
[14:44:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but what if it gets AJAX-ed in? When that happens, the document turns into a multipage document.
[14:45:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe we should look at it from other angle... the idea is to prevent the title attribute being used for all pages in a multipage template
[14:45:28] <uGoMobi> that is what we need to prevent
[14:47:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, in that case, http://jsbin.com/omacox/236/ doesn't work either ... although it makes sense the way it is.
[14:48:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you go to page 1, you see the title from page 1. If you go to page 2, you see the title from page 2.
[14:48:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You never see the document title.
[14:48:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see
[14:49:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we should use the document title here for the first page
[14:49:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the second page we use the h1 because there is no data-title attr so that's correct
[14:50:33] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[14:51:06] <ulf`> sabotage says he disabled auto join and is sorry for it being enabled. Could you please remove his ban?
[14:52:40] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ^
[15:02:25] * gseguin checks
[15:03:14] <gseguin> ulf`: unbanned
[15:06:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Here it is: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/b4d1fe93b73930416f76cef497668a2f7ecf4459/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L868
[15:06:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We now always have an active entry, because it's being added during library load.
[15:07:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not sure if, whenever  $.mobile.urlHistory.activeIndex is 0, we use document.title ...
[15:08:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: s/we use/we should use/
[15:11:16] <toddmparker> arschmitz and I have been talking…disabling ajax in the demos is probably a good idea
[15:11:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think we should
[15:11:56] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I agree
[15:12:45] <toddmparker> cool
[15:12:50] <toddmparker> any dissenters?
[15:15:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then how should we do it?
[15:15:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can also say if ( toPage[ 0 ] === $.mobile.firstPage[ 0 ] ) { use document.title; }
[15:16:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but that may be equivalent ...
[15:18:20] <gseguin> johnbender: eureka!
[15:18:33] <johnbender> gseguin: that sounds exciting :)
[15:18:39] <gseguin> for those tests where we still use /js/
[15:18:59] <gseguin> I created a middleware that will return the built bundle
[15:19:09] <gseguin> no more dependency on PHP !
[15:19:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am sorry but I think I need to give it a closer look to say something useful about an alternative
[15:19:47] <gseguin> but that means the test target depends on build which is OK I think
[15:19:57] <gseguin> since building takes about 2sec
[15:20:19] <gseguin> Running "qunit:http" (qunit) task
[15:20:19] <gseguin> Testing http://localhost:9912/tests/unit/event/index.html
[15:20:19] <gseguin> /js/ requested, serving: dist/jquery.mobile.js
[15:20:19] <gseguin> ............................OK
[15:20:21] <gseguin> >> 61 assertions passed (9189ms)
[15:20:25] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[15:37:13] <johnbender> gseguin: super nice
[15:37:51] <johnbender> gseguin: yes, the tests take forever so building before hand is minor
[15:38:04] <johnbender> gseguin: getting rid of the php dep is hot
[15:38:18] <gseguin> johnbender: done!
[15:38:21] <johnbender> gseguin: once we move the docs completely outside the repo we can discard it all together
[15:38:33] * johnbender is not sad
[15:39:04] <_|Nix|_> Oh, cool! If PHP is gone then docs can be viewed via file:// as well ...
[15:39:25] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yup
[15:39:36] <_|Nix|_> Shweet!
[15:40:47] <gseguin> I've got failure gallore on tests/unit/navigation/sequence/sequence-push-state-disabled-dialog-hash-key-tests.html
[15:40:53] <gseguin> is that expected?
[15:47:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Not really.
[15:47:15] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: They work fine for me.
[15:47:29] <gseguin> ok, good to know might be something in my branch
[15:47:46] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll run the tests again just to be sure.
[15:47:54] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: other one failing consistently is tests/unit/init/dialog-load-tests.html
[15:56:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Nav tests are all green here.
[15:57:28] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: init is all green too.
[16:15:42] <gseguin> johnbender: this morning the thing you said about PhantomJS and QUnit
[16:16:21] <gseguin> johnbender: is it causing some navigation tests to fail in PhantomJS?
[16:37:30] <gseguin> oh yeah! grunt test --jquery=1.6.4,1.7.2,git
[16:37:30] <gseguin> ?BOOM
