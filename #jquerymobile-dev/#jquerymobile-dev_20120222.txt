[07:46:42] <Wilto> Morning bros and/or ladybros.
[08:18:41] <gseguin> good morning
[08:44:39] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker: Wilto: http://johnbender.us/2012/02/22/leveraging-your-insecurities/
[08:44:42] <johnbender> you're all mentioned
[08:44:53] <Wilto> Saw that, man. Great post.
[08:44:56] <johnbender> you'll have to read it to learn whether it's slanderous :D
[08:45:14] <johnbender> Wilto: thanks man!
[08:45:20] * gseguin puts his reading glasses on
[08:45:35] <Wilto> Except for the part where you blatantly deceive your audience into thinking I’m some kind of “professional developer.”
[08:54:59] <johnbender> Wilto: hah, it's too late you're branded for life
[08:55:08] <Wilto> NOOO
[08:55:40] <johnbender> Wilto: the best part is now I'll actually have to phrase my suggestions in the form of a question all the time
[08:55:45] <johnbender> hilarity will ensue I'm sure
[08:56:27] <Wilto> Like Whose Line is it Anyway up in here, from now on.
[08:56:34] <johnbender> exactly!
[08:59:35] <gseguin> johnbender: nice article! thanks for the mention
[09:02:14] <johnbender> all be back online once I take a shower and make it into the office
[09:02:30] <johnbender> watching your daughter solo in the evenings doesn't leave much time for showers :(
[09:02:38] <johnbender> s/all/I'll/

[11:06:13] <johnbender> :D
[11:06:29] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: just so you know I tried really really hard to get us some swap space
[11:06:39] <johnbender> but the way Media Temple has their servers set up doesn't permit it
[11:06:51] <Wilto> What.
[11:06:57] <Wilto> Do we have a contact over there worth harassing?
[11:07:04] <johnbender> (they bill, at least in part, based on memory)
[11:07:11] <Wilto> I’m getting REALLY good at going on crusades, lately.
[11:07:40] <johnbender> Wilto: it's not going to happen
[11:07:53] <Wilto> did you try swearing at people y/n
[11:07:56] <Wilto> That sucks, man.
[11:08:03] <johnbender> I spent nearly a whole day bothering danheberden and eventually our contacts over there
[11:08:15] <johnbender> they were kind enough to tollerate it
[11:08:31] <Wilto> Weeeak.
[11:08:42] <Wilto> Wasn’t there some talk of… a ghetto swap file?
[11:08:55] <Wilto> Like creating a partition or whatever and using that?
[11:09:18] <Wilto> Note: http://wil.to/_/noidea.jpg
[11:11:24] <gseguin> :D
[11:12:27] <gseguin> oh my! Wilto: a battle for you if you want: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-add-the-product-to-the-shopping-cart-which-is-on-list-view#14737000003085025

[11:55:02] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Partial fix for #3558 - Appropriately styles buttonMarkup elements using `.ui-disabled` in IE. This commit contains two instances of IE’s `filter`, and one !important. We’ve all done things we’re not proud of. - Mat Marquis
[11:55:29] <Wilto> …I don’t want to talk about it.
[11:56:00] <gseguin> say what?! !important, really?
[11:56:55] <gseguin> oh man that must be painful...
[11:57:36] <Wilto> And filter. And ZOOM: 1.
[12:56:11] <toddmparker_> Wilto is a HACK
[12:56:16] <toddmparker_> sorry guys
[12:56:18] <Wilto> True facts.
[12:56:22] <toddmparker_> indeed.
[12:56:24] <toddmparker_> Just FYI - I'll be travelling for the next 2 days so Mat and I can't meet on Thursday but you guys can do a check in
[12:56:48] <toddmparker_> please shoot me en email or post to BC if you need to reach me
[12:56:59] <toddmparker_> think we're in good shape for 1.1...i'll be working on the RC blog post this weekend
[13:23:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: one thing I wanted to ask you about today is how we're going to do the RC
[13:23:15] <johnbender> as far as the website is concerned
[13:23:50] <johnbender> we have our current stable (1.0.1) and a release candidate that we want to show to people
[13:26:41] <toddmparker_> sure
[13:26:57] <toddmparker_> I was thinking it would would be a blog post mainly
[13:27:22] <toddmparker_> I'll leave most other stuff on the site pointing to 1.1
[13:27:26] <toddmparker_> sorry 1.0
[13:27:53] <toddmparker_> once 1.1 is released, 1.0.1 will be a legacy release that will just be a link on the home and download page
[13:35:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ok so we won't have the docs up for 1.1.0rc1 then?
[13:36:16] <johnbender> that's much easier from my end :D
[13:37:08] <toddmparker_> oh, i see
[13:37:19] <toddmparker_> you mean run the build?
[13:37:25] <toddmparker_> i think so, yes
[13:37:57] <toddmparker_> this will be similar to all the other releases except I won't link this up as the primary demo page
[13:37:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: oh no we're running the test build for both stable and latest which in this case would be the rc
[13:38:30] <toddmparker_> so this would have the docs, cdn links, etc.
[13:38:30] <johnbender> I just wanted to know if I needed to set something up to have a version of the docs for stable and for the rc
[13:39:14] <toddmparker_> we'd need both, right?
[13:39:15] <johnbender> ok so you _do_ want to have the same facilities for 1.1.0-rc1 as for 1.0.1?
[13:39:22] <johnbender> that's what I thought
[13:39:26] <toddmparker_> but we already have a 1.0.1 docs and such
[13:39:26] <johnbender> and that's why I was asking
[13:39:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah so we just have to add a place on the website for the rc
[13:39:39] <toddmparker_> yeah, sorry for the confusion
[13:39:42] <johnbender> no no
[13:39:43] <toddmparker_> the normal process
[13:39:51] <johnbender> I'm glad we got it sorted
[13:40:04] <toddmparker_> i may doa few different things on the JQM site
[13:40:09] <toddmparker_> but that's just a WP thing
[13:40:17] <toddmparker_> ok, good :)
[13:40:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so we're targeting monday?
[13:40:29] <johnbender> just so I know when I need to get that sorted out by
[13:41:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: also semver.org has a 2.0 rc
[13:41:27] <johnbender>  that handles the postfix confusion
[13:41:33] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://semver.org
[13:41:35] <johnbender> see #12
[13:41:45] <johnbender> so the tag should be 1.1.0-rc.1
[13:51:44] <Wilto> Relay from Todd, johnbender: Yes. He’s gonna try to get the blog post done this weekend.
