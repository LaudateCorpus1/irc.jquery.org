[02:07:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome!
[02:07:47] <bot-t> (9 hours 28 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell _|Nix|_ : I think we are done! now we only have to test test test :)
[02:07:58] <uGoMobi> morning _|Nix|_
[02:08:22] <_|Nix|_> Hey! So, you've figured out the bottom border thing?
[02:08:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, but still won't work on IE7/8... shall we add simple function for that?
[02:09:21] <uGoMobi> $.mobile.ie returns true if IE7/8, right?
[02:09:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think it also returns true on WP7 ...
[02:09:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... because we use it to turn off history for the popup on WP7.
[02:09:58] <uGoMobi> that's good, WP7 is based on IE7/8
[02:10:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, great! We have a weiner ...
[02:10:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but we need a class that applies the bottom border to the container, not to the child.
[02:12:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I thought we could just use .css()
[02:12:59] <uGoMobi> to set border-bottom-width
[02:13:21] <uGoMobi> have to check if we can set that property with css()
[02:15:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but the container has to have the border colour from some other class, or setting the width from .css() will have no effect.
[02:16:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why the container?
[02:16:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Because the child may or may not be the last child.
[02:16:20] <uGoMobi> we can use .css("border-bottom-width","1px") BTW
[02:16:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, we can, but what if "border-bottom-color" is unset?
[02:17:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  if ( $.mobile.ie ).find( "li" ).last()..css("border-bottom-width", "1px" );
[02:18:13] <uGoMobi> err
[02:18:34] <uGoMobi>  if ( $.mobile.ie ) { $("ul" ).find( "li" ).last()..css("border-bottom-width", "1px" ); }
[02:18:38] <_|Nix|_> last() is not a good idea, because you can append an item later, and then what used to be last() is no longer last().
[02:18:53] <_|Nix|_> But I've had an idea.
[02:18:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know
[02:19:49] <_|Nix|_> Assuming $.mobile.browser.ie is established early enough, we can add a behaviour to these widgets that implements refresh().
[02:19:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: any event we can bind to, to make it refresh?
[02:20:05] <_|Nix|_> updatelayout?
[02:20:13] <_|Nix|_> But that's a bad idea because it fires often.
[02:20:16] <uGoMobi> yeah, maybe
[02:20:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but it is just for IE7/8
[02:20:52] <uGoMobi> almost all WP7 phones are updated to WP7.5 (=IE9)
[02:22:19] <uGoMobi> IMHO I mean it doesn't need to be perfect
[02:24:04] <uGoMobi> can't type :(
[02:35:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does IE9 have :last-child?
[02:36:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[02:46:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just tested dynamically adding elements to controlgroups... works great and if people still have a call to controlgroup() in their code to refresh it, it works great too... nice!
[02:55:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It does? Weird that, if you call controlgroup again it works correctly, since I removed the code that detects an already-enhanced controlgroup.
[02:56:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we can include a refresh() method and document that you don't normally need to use it unless you're running on IE7/8 ...
[02:56:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why do we need a refresh method?
[02:57:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Instead of a calling  controlgroup() again.
[02:57:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sorry, missed end of your line
[02:57:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The correct API is not to create the widget again, but to call refresh() ...
[02:57:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes I understand
[02:58:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, basically, we punt the responsibility for making the widget look correct to devs.
[02:58:51] <uGoMobi> I just missed the reason why we should need the refresh.... but that's for IE7/8
[02:58:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly.
[02:59:10] <_|Nix|_> You only need to call refresh() on IE7/8 ...
[02:59:12] <uGoMobi> was hoping we could keep that even more simple
[03:00:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe we should ask toddmparker_ first if we find a missing border bottom acceptable as graceful degrading
[03:01:04] <uGoMobi> we could add a demo to the docs of a function that adds the border bottom on the last item on IE7/8, WP7
[03:01:39] <uGoMobi> and tell people you have to call it again if you inject content
[03:01:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can we not apply the border to the container though? _create: function() { if ( $.mobile.browser.ie ) { this.element.addClass( "ui-controlgroup-add-bottom-border" ); } }
[03:02:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then we would have the same problem
[03:02:42] <uGoMobi> because the border is on the last element in the container
[03:03:10] <uGoMobi> so how do we make only that element respond to that class?
[03:03:20] <uGoMobi> you would a :last selector
[03:03:30] <uGoMobi> s/would/would need/
[03:03:43] <_|Nix|_> Nono.
[03:04:06] <_|Nix|_> Instead of .ui-controlgroup we have .ui-controlgroup.ui-controgrloup-add-bottom-border
[03:04:21] <uGoMobi> yes
[03:04:29] <_|Nix|_> and .ui-controlgroup-add-bottom-border { border-bottom-width: 1px; }
[03:04:52] <_|Nix|_> THen, when you add children to the controlgroup, it automatically expands to enclose the new children.
[03:04:57] <uGoMobi> but the container has no border at all
[03:05:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so what you're saying is that border-width and border-color are not defined for the container?
[03:05:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly
[03:05:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, can we not apply the border to the container as well?
[03:06:09] <uGoMobi> in the theme CSS we define borders for .ui-btn-up/hover/down-a/b/c/d/e
[03:06:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, because of theming issues
[03:06:38] <uGoMobi> each button could have different theme
[03:06:51] <uGoMobi> so what border color are you going to apply to the container?
[03:06:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Suppose the controlgroup could have a theme of its own?
[03:07:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If the controlgroup were to inherit the theme, it could have a theme, but you don't see any of it except the borders.
[03:07:46] <_|Nix|_> OK,  but I see how that's a hack.
[03:08:01] <_|Nix|_> The true solution is to show the bottom border of the last button.
[03:08:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we would have to remove all borders from elements to prevent double borders
[03:08:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I really think we shouldn't make it too complicated just for old IE
[03:08:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Definitely not.
[03:10:11] <_|Nix|_> OK. Let's see what we have so far.
[03:10:20] * _|Nix|_ fires up the Windblows machine ...
[03:11:56] <jzaefferer> johnbender: is there any way to speed up this build? 1hr+ blocks a bunch of other jobs; http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/
[03:13:01] <jzaefferer> johnbender: kinda related, what's going on with the TestSwarm job? http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20TestSwarm%20Master/ - why isn't that running against Firefox or Chrome?
[03:13:30] <jzaefferer> johnbender: let me know if I can help there, or Timo (Krinkle|detached)
[03:13:56] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: I guess we're testing against a bunch of versions of jQuery there ... no wonder it takes so long. Maybe we can break it up into multiple jobs by jQuery version ...
[03:14:37] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: which versions are that?
[03:14:53] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: 1.6.4, 1.7.1, 1.7.2, 1.8.0
[03:15:13] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: So the whole test suite is run four times over
[03:16:22] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: okay, but that still doesn't really explain why it takes so long; we run jQuery UI against those versions in TestSwarm (12 browsers) and its comparable if not even faster; Phantom should be a lot faster then TestSwarm
[03:17:05] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: I guess the more interesting question: Why does the phantom job take 20 minutes? http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/
[03:17:52] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: We have some long nav sequence tests. Sometimes we wait 20 seconds.
[03:18:15] <jzaefferer> wat
[03:18:16] <jzaefferer> :/
[03:18:45] <_|Nix|_> We have to make sure that an event /doesn't/ occur.
[03:19:06] <jzaefferer> That sounds terrible.
[03:19:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How come the last-item-has-no-border problem doesn't happen with horizontal control groups?
[03:19:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: /me is looking at tests/functional/controlgroup.html in IE8 ...
[03:20:03] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Obviously, if that's a problem we can try to improve the tests.
[03:20:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because there we don't hide borders but shift the whole button 1px so the borders collapse
[03:20:28] <uGoMobi> or better... are on top of eachother
[03:20:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, why don't we do that in the vertical case as well?
[03:20:43] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: it sounds like it would profit more then just jenkins jobs. Developers shouldn't have to wait that long either to run tests frequently.
[03:21:39] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Well, the tests can also be run locally, and one can pick which ones run. So, if your commit affects a certain aspect of the project, you wouldn't run unrelated tests locally, and they'd still run on the bot.
[03:22:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good point... I can test that solution
[03:23:38] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: ... but you're right. I need to start devoting more attention to the tests again.
[03:25:26] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: took 86s to run just the navigation tests on my machine
[03:27:01] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: It's mostly the sequence tests that take a while, and we have to run them several times with different configurations to test the navigation corner cases.
[03:27:56] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: I've added those tests in anticipation of johnbender's navigation refactor, to make sure all the corner cases that were being handled by the existing navigation continue to be handled in the refactored version.
[03:41:33] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Old build #69: FAILURE in 1 hr 18 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/69/
[03:44:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am afraid that maybe we do need a refresh() method for controlgroup
[03:44:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For all platforms or just IE7/8?
[03:45:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we wrap the buttons in .ui-controlgroup-controls and when you append a new button we should unwrap and wrap again
[03:45:25] <uGoMobi> for all platforms
[03:46:14] <uGoMobi> otherwise people have to append to .ui-controlgroup-controls
[03:47:05] <uGoMobi> if this is your markup...
[03:47:08] <uGoMobi> <fieldset data-role="controlgroup" id="group-a">
[03:47:08] <uGoMobi>     <legend>Button vertical:</legend>
[03:47:08] <uGoMobi>     <button id="e1">Button</button>
[03:47:08] <uGoMobi> </fieldset>
[03:47:51] <uGoMobi> you would expect you can append a new button to "#group-a"
[03:48:55] <uGoMobi> but you would have to append to "#group-a .ui-controlgroup-controls"
[03:49:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nononono ... I added a container() method.
[03:49:50] <_|Nix|_> $( "#myControlgroup" ).controlgroup( "container" ).append( $( "<a href='#'>" ).buttonMarkup() );
[03:50:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, it's not obvious, but there is an API for appending without your having to know the internal structure of the controlgroup.
[03:50:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, cool
[03:51:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let me test again :)
[03:51:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I ran into that very problem while constructing the functional test.
[03:52:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok now it's working fine :)
[03:53:44] <_|Nix|_> *whew* ... *wipe forehead*
[03:54:42] <uGoMobi> :)
[04:17:41] <_|Nix|_> OK ... checkboxradio needs a _destroy() method ...

[04:19:41] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/css-corner-styling 08d4eb8 Gabriel Schulhof: [controlgroup functional test] Add ability to append/prepend selects and checkboxes in addition to links
[04:21:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Still have some problems with combining different kinds of widgets: Check out the latest commit (^), go to tests/functional/controlgroup.html, click Prepend (prepends a link), "Select" (next time a select will be added), Prepend (prepends a select).
[04:21:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The corners aren't right.
[04:21:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll write the _destroy() for the checkboxradio so checkboxradios can be removed.
[04:22:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lemme check
[04:24:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't see the corner issue local
[04:25:23] <_|Nix|_> K, weird ...
[04:25:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Try Link, Prepend, Checkbox, Prepend
[04:28:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah I see it now
[04:29:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think I know the cause
[04:30:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in the CSS I use "last-of-type" to select the last select
[04:30:45] <uGoMobi> because with ":last-child" there is an issue with the <label>
[04:31:20] <uGoMobi> same goes for first-child
[04:32:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure why it also happens with checkboxradio
[04:33:00] <uGoMobi> will try to fix this in the CSS
[04:33:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[04:33:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The funny thing is if you do Link, Prepend, Checkbox, Prepend, Append, it fixes itself.
[04:34:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, the append also fixes the previously prepended one.
[04:34:56] <uGoMobi> interesting
[04:36:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice test BTW!
[04:37:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[04:37:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you add a label for the select in that test?
[04:38:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[04:38:59] <uGoMobi> more complicated... the label could be before or after the select... but lets forget about that for now
[04:39:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can fix that in the widget.
[04:39:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can reverse the order if we find that it is incorrect.
[04:39:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[04:39:57] <uGoMobi> Chrome already switch it when it renders the page, but FF and IE don't
[04:40:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ugh, but that may affect the behaviour of _destroy() ...
[04:40:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's assume the order is correct. Where's the right place to put it? After the <select>?
[04:41:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: BTW starting id's with numbers is not allowed
[04:41:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: label before the select
[04:42:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, sorry ... I'll add something before the number.
[04:42:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe html5 do allow id's to start with numbers,not sure
[04:43:25] <uGoMobi> but to be sure just put something in front of it
[04:43:46] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[04:47:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Adding a label to a select breaks things ... maybe I'm not doing it right. Can you check my next commit?
[04:47:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure
[04:48:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pushed.

[04:48:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Another failure: Checkbox, Prepend, Link, Prepend
[04:49:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It really sucks that you can't remove checkboxes ... I need to do a $.fn.rmButtonMarkup() ...
[04:50:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... because the label gets all marked up when creating the checkboxradio ...
[04:50:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we already talked about integrating buttonMarkup() in the button widget
[04:51:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but there's a problem with that. buttonMarkup() needs to be fast, and if you go through a widget, you need to go through that whole _create() process.
[04:51:14] <uGoMobi> maybe better to look at that than adding another public function
[04:51:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you are right
[04:52:46] <_|Nix|_> I guess I can hold off on the _destroy() for the checkbox for now. We can use the functional test without it.
[04:53:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, so, when I add a label to a select it doesn't become part of the button - it goes above the select, so it doesn't look good.
[04:53:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Did I do something wrong in my latest commit?
[04:53:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looking now
[04:53:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I'll consult the documentation to see what I did wrong ...
[04:54:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I already know
[04:54:28] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm class="select" is given in the docs.
[04:54:34] <_|Nix|_> Is that it?
[04:54:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, that class is uperfluous
[04:54:54] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK.
[04:54:59] <_|Nix|_> So what did I do wrong?
[04:55:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in a controlgroup you have to add class ui-hidden-accessible to the label
[04:55:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK, to the checkbox label as well?
[04:55:43] <uGoMobi> the label is supposed to be there for semantic reasons but it shouldn't be visible
[04:55:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no not for checkbox/radio
[04:55:59] <_|Nix|_> OK, so, only for the select. OK.
[04:56:00] <uGoMobi> there we style the label element as button
[04:56:53] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I know, that's why I was wondering how that's compatible with ui-hidden-accessible - but I guess it's not :)
[04:57:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see http://jquerymobile.com/branches/css-corner-styling/docs/demos/controlgroups/index.html
[04:57:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, fixed.

[04:58:01] <uGoMobi> great
[04:58:24] <_|Nix|_> Working on this together is awesome, BTW!
[04:58:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see the form demo page http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/
[04:59:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah it's definately nice to work like this!
[04:59:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see the form ui-hidden-accessible and ui-hide-label demo pages
[05:00:12] <uGoMobi> you can use it to hide the legend instead of the label in case of checkbox/radio
[05:02:39] <uGoMobi> annoying thing is that the label is hidden but still in the code so the first ui-select isn't first child
[05:04:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ...
[05:04:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can we move the label inside the buttonMarkup?
[05:04:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or inside the wrapper ...
[05:04:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was thinking the same (inside the wrapper)
[05:05:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK ... *shrug* ...
[05:05:15] <_|Nix|_> What could go wrong?
[05:05:21] <uGoMobi> but ther is another thing I have to look at... radio, checkbox, select are all divs but buttons are not
[05:05:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, I'll move the label inside the wrapper.
[05:06:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but we should talk about that with the others as well ...
[05:06:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, even if it doesn't solve anything... it is cleaner
[05:07:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah let's wait with that
[05:07:14] <uGoMobi> could cause issues if the label isn't hidden
[05:07:46] <uGoMobi> I mean, if not in a controlgroup
[05:12:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Basically, a widget should always be a div. That way you can move it around easily.
[05:12:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: More generally, a widget should always have exactly one outermost element.
[05:12:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, working on doing the same for slider
[05:13:07] <uGoMobi> can't make it full width if it's not all wrapped in a div
[05:17:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does <button> and <input type="button"> also have <label>?
[05:17:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I want to add those to the controlgroup functional test as well.
[05:18:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good one.. yes they can
[05:18:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe I should make labels hidden by default in the CSS when they are in a controlgroup
[05:19:49] <uGoMobi> but we also set the WAI-ARIA role if I am not mistaken
[05:19:58] <_|Nix|_> Man, this is turning into some kind of quagmire ..
[05:19:59] <uGoMobi> so that would require JS
[05:20:06] <uGoMobi> :)
[05:20:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: collapsible sets must be easy by comparison, because they can contain collapsibles, and nothing else, right?
[05:21:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: don't forget you can nest a collapsible in a collapsible ;)
[05:21:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: fixed the corner styling
[05:21:44] <uGoMobi> only have to look at the border bottom
[05:22:15] <uGoMobi> and there will still be a problem if the label of a select comes after the select element itself
[05:22:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We should be able to fix that during widget creation - just gotta remember to unfix it during widget destruction.
[05:23:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: shall we fix that in the widget? making sure label comes before the select
[05:23:06] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[05:23:10] <uGoMobi> cool
[05:24:18] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... again, not that simple. Does the spec say that the label must be immediately next to the widget (either before or after)? Or can the label be somewhere else in the document and still work?
[05:24:59] <_|Nix|_> If it can, there's still a solution, but I'm just wondering if we need to code that solution.
[05:26:02] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I think I'm going to go with the placeholder solution I used with the popup.
[05:26:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmmm... I don't think it needs to be immediately before or after the select as long as you associate it with an id
[05:26:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. NP.
[05:26:49] <uGoMobi> actually... now you mention it... you are even allowed to wrap the whole select in a label
[05:26:51] <uGoMobi> :(
[05:27:21] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[05:27:50] <uGoMobi> but I am fine with just saying to people... don't do that
[05:28:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5219
[05:28:53] <_|Nix|_> Well, actually, while we're on the topic, we could also say to people: "Don't put the label after the select" ...
[05:31:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... maybe we could turn the functional test into a demo.
[05:32:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think as long as there exists a way to dynamically insert a select with a label into a controlgroup and have it look correct, then we don't need to account for all possible arrangements of selects and their labels.
[05:32:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thinking the same... actually I created a demo page to test injecting items in controlgroups but your test is better
[05:32:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, then I'll add <button> and <input type="button"> to the test.
[05:33:16] <_|Nix|_> Dunno about "View Source" though ... might be kinda large :)
[05:33:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I agree... we can simply say what is the markup convention for selects in controlgroups
[05:33:40] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[05:35:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or for selects in general.
[05:37:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, right now, the label precedes the widget. Can we make the controlgroup work correctly if this is always the case?
[05:37:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or do we have to specify that, when the user prepends, the label must follow the widget?

[05:38:23] * _|Nix|_ pulls eagerly from origin
[05:38:32] <uGoMobi> this will work if the label comes before the select
[05:38:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, great!
[05:39:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll make <button> and <input type="button"> elements the same way - label before the element.
[05:40:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I go look at the border of vertical selects now to see if we can do it the same as horizontal controlgroups
[05:41:25] <uGoMobi> s/vertical selects/vertical controlgroups/
[05:43:25] <_|Nix|_> OK. Functional test looks good. I had to make a minor modification to remove the lables as well as the inputs when you click on them.

[06:03:11] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[06:03:21] <uGoMobi> hey frequent
[06:03:25] <frequent> hey there
[06:03:50] <frequent> solved my dead button problem
[06:04:12] <uGoMobi> frequent: hehe great!
[06:04:35] <frequent> could it be that on older devices (iOS3, iOS4, Android 2.3) bindings to input elements don't work while binding to closest .ui-btn does?
[06:05:16] <uGoMobi> frequent: see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5252
[06:05:34] <uGoMobi> frequent: I think it depends on what event you bind
[06:06:19] <frequent> I tried click initially, but
[06:06:31] <frequent> I can click go for a coffe and when I'm back maybe I get an alert
[06:06:53] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:07:38] <frequent> now I'm binding to the closest ui-btn and that works with click and vclick on my ... museum of devices
[06:09:13] <uGoMobi> frequent: and you bind on "pageinit" ?
[06:09:29] <frequent> um...
[06:12:23] <frequent> ... nope. The button in question is loaded via MyCrummyFetchContentViaAjax handler, so I'm binding on Ajax Success
[06:13:41] <frequent> I could always alert a "hello bound", but click/tap/whatever never triggered. Checked z-index for input vs. ui-btn-inner vs. ui-btn  (sames as JQM docs), so eventually I wound up binding to ui-btn vs. input
[06:15:50] <uGoMobi> frequent: this sounds similar https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2383#issuecomment-5574248
[06:17:21] <frequent> uGoMobi: it does. sure is nice to know someone who knows all issues :-)
[06:21:05] <uGoMobi> frequent: what worries me is that I sometimes even remember the ticket number ;-)
[06:21:44] <frequent> we have that TV-show in Germany where people can make crazy bets...
[06:23:32] <uGoMobi> frequent: Wetten Dass?
[06:23:58] <frequent> uGoMobi: yup.
[06:25:07] <frequent> so you bet would be: I bet that uGoMobi know all topics and contributors of all ...3000 tickets in JQM ...
[06:25:21] <frequent> blindfolded of course.
[06:25:57] <uGoMobi> and then people say.... what a pathetic guy... get a life! ;-)
[06:29:08] <frequent> :-D
[06:32:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just saw that we already have a rule in the CSS to hide the label of a select in a controlgroup
[06:32:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure why it didn't work in your test
[06:33:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good news... we can do the border bottom thing the same as we do for horizontal controlgroups... works fine on all browsers including IE7/8!

[06:46:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the reason the label wasn't hidden in the functional test is because the widget is supposed to add class "ui-select" to the label as well, but that doesn't happen for some reason
[07:17:14] <arschmitz> Morning uGoMobi:
[07:17:23] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz

[12:26:42] <toddmparker> hey _|Nix|_ and johnbender
[12:26:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if anyone knows how fucking annoying that is, it's me
[12:26:50] <johnbender> toddmparker: yo!
[12:26:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Just need to console.log the living daylights out of things ...
[12:26:59] <toddmparker> sorry I was off yesterday, jury duty
[12:27:13] <johnbender> toddmparker: a patriotic day for you indeed
[12:27:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Did that conflict with your right to vote?
[12:28:47] <toddmparker> nope. I did both.
[12:28:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Great!
[12:28:56] <toddmparker> It was a good day.
[12:29:03] <toddmparker> so what did I miss?
[12:29:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It helps that I can reproduce the issue locally, but I have to remind myself to not suspend my laptop, because it happens once every, like, 30 runs. It also helps that I need not run the whole suite, but only the sequence tests.
[12:31:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, where're we at with css-corner-styling? Are we fixing the unit tests and then merging?
[12:32:38] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'm finally seeing daylight with the test suite
[12:33:51] <toddmparker> johnbender: great to hear
[12:34:05] <toddmparker> be so good to have you look at the nav stuff after that
[12:34:24] <toddmparker> i really just want that to be a plugin, like any other widget instead of tied up in core
[12:34:57] <johnbender> toddmparker: well we're headed down that path but we have a ways to go
[12:35:34] <toddmparker> sure
[12:35:44] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_:
[12:36:02] <toddmparker> on the corners, I'm curious where we are with that. been seeing commits not eh corners from uGoMobi
[12:37:01] <toddmparker> if you want to hack on some 1.3 features, let me know
[12:37:03] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am here now
[12:37:08] <toddmparker> there are some easy ones you could knock off
[12:37:12] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi
[12:37:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: corner stuff is done
[12:38:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looks like bot-t is gone so in case you missed... only thing we have to look at is the removal of a checkbox in the functional test... the wrapper div.ui-checkbox isn't removed.... we might need a destroy method for the checkboxradio widget like we have for select
[12:40:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, we need a destroy method, but the checkbox calls .buttonMarkup() on the label, so the label ends up heavily modified, so it won't be easy to restore the label to its previous state, unless we write code that undoes everything that .buttonMarkup() does.
[12:40:16] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you changed the styles for all widgets to use :inherit now?
[12:40:24] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes
[12:40:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Basically, we need to remove all the data-* attributes it adds, and remove all the divs it creates.
[12:40:29] <toddmparker> dang!
[12:40:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[12:40:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we basically need a "_destroy()" for buttonMarkup.
[12:40:55] <toddmparker> ok, so the next step is to sweep thru the JS and remove the cruft
[12:41:01] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Done.
[12:41:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: _|Nix|_ did that
[12:41:13] <toddmparker> I owe you guys some beers
[12:41:23] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:41:27] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:41:44] <toddmparker> so is there anything left to do for corners then?
[12:41:58] <uGoMobi> not really
[12:42:09] <uGoMobi> we tested all kind of edge cases as well
[12:42:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No, but a somewhat unrelated wrinkle has cropped up: we should write a _destroy() method for checkboxes, but that in turn needs a way to undo what .buttonMarkup() does.
[12:42:39] <toddmparker> so good to see that get simplified
[12:42:46] <toddmparker> is that all in branch or master?
[12:42:54] <uGoMobi> branch
[12:42:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: In a branch for now.
[12:43:00] <uGoMobi> css-corner-styling
[12:43:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's wait with the checkbox destruction for now, and concentrate on merging. What say you?
[12:43:20] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[12:43:24] <uGoMobi> we did the same for border-bottom on last item in a group (listview, controlgroup)
[12:43:29] <uGoMobi> that's in same branch
[12:43:31] <toddmparker> smart
[12:43:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, I agree
[12:43:57] <toddmparker> let me know if you need a set of eyes on the code
[12:44:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I made corners an option for inset collapsibles
[12:44:13] <toddmparker> if you guys feel like this is square, we can merge it into master
[12:44:24] <toddmparker> ah, that wasn't?
[12:44:31] <uGoMobi> it wasn't
[12:44:43] <uGoMobi> was actually thinking of doing the same for dialogs
[12:44:51] <toddmparker> could you guys do me a favor and start jotting changes for the future release notes
[12:44:58] <toddmparker> while it's still fresh in our minds
[12:45:14] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:45:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We need to make the unit tests pass. That should be quite an undertaking, because a lot of the assumptions have changed.
[12:45:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we should create a ticket for this and close it with the merge commit
[12:46:00] <uGoMobi> issue ticket should get a milestone
[12:46:01] <toddmparker> right, I can see this messing with unit tests quite a bit
[12:46:09] <toddmparker> agreed
[12:46:14] <uGoMobi> that way it's easier to track
[12:47:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Will you, or shall I?
[12:48:04] <uGoMobi> I will add pure CSS corner styling to the roadmap wiki page with a check mark in front of it
[12:48:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I'll do it
[12:48:45] <uGoMobi> will link roadmap to the ticket too
[12:49:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was there a ticket for making a controlgroup a widget?
[12:50:26] <toddmparker> I created a wiki page for us to add notes as we go
[12:50:27] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.3-Release-Notes
[12:50:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ummm ... dunno, but it should be fixed :)
[12:50:32] <toddmparker> too easy to forget stuff
[12:50:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok
[12:50:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: And it should be marked with DevTasks
[12:50:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[12:51:03] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yes, there is a control group issue
[12:51:06] <toddmparker> (looks)
[12:51:46] <toddmparker> I found this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4773
[12:52:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's not about making it into a widget, but it's good because I fixed that too.
[12:52:44] <uGoMobi> ah great, we can close that one
[12:53:04] <toddmparker> this one is already closed - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4851
[12:56:00] <toddmparker> BTW - I just closed this PR since we're going to use UI's tabs
[12:56:00] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4865
[12:56:35] <toddmparker> I know we have making controlgroup and grid as a roadmap item, but I don't see issues. Grid isn't going to be a widget anymore anyway
[12:57:28] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and _|Nix|_
[12:57:35] <toddmparker> Found this in the roadmap:
[12:57:37] <toddmparker> [✓] Make controlgroup function a widget - Gabriel
[12:57:37] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3918
[12:57:38] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4851
[12:58:05] <toddmparker> confirming: we decided NOT to make grid a widget, right?
[12:58:42] <toddmparker> were we going to marge this code into the navbar widget since it's only used there
[12:58:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we talked about moving the grid funtion to the navbar plugin
[12:59:37] <toddmparker> yeah
[12:59:39] <toddmparker> ok
[12:59:56] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I will look at Keith his work on grid/tile listviews and see if it uses grid() or not
[13:01:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: 4851 is a feature request. Do we want a corners option for controlgroup?
[13:02:16] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I think it just uses CSS
[13:02:51] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: As for 3918, I dunno if turning controlgroup into a widget has caused it to start emitting controlgroupcreate events.
[13:03:42] <toddmparker> so is control group a widget now?
[13:03:51] <toddmparker> or have we not touched these?
[13:04:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It is.
[13:08:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'll remove the feature request tag from #3918, because I just checked, and controlgroup does emit controlgroupcreate now that it's a widget.
[13:09:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, do we want a corners option for controlgroup?
[13:10:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It would simply add the class ui-corner-all to the outermost div.
[13:13:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: +1 for option corners for controlgroup
[13:13:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK ...
[13:13:29] <bot-t> (3 hours 43 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell _|Nix|_ : only thing we have to look at is the removal of a checkbox in the functional test... the wrapper div.ui-checkbox isn't removed.... we might need a destroy method for the checkboxradio widget like we have for select
[13:13:47] <uGoMobi> I think we have to be consistent and not make corners an option for some widgets and others have corners by default
[13:13:54] <toddmparker> yeah, I think that the option there makes sense
[13:14:06] <toddmparker> esp. now that it just adds that class to the container or not
[13:14:07] <uGoMobi> welcome back bot-t
[13:14:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK.
[13:15:45] <toddmparker> if you guys can help me get the issues in line for this so we can knock 'em down
[13:17:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you added option dismissable for popups, right?
[13:17:30] <uGoMobi> that's also for 1.3 I suppose
[13:17:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[13:23:16] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_:
[13:23:18] <toddmparker> BOOM
[13:23:38] <toddmparker> cool, I didn't know that landed already
[13:23:44] <toddmparker> nice work _|Nix|_
[13:24:29] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: this might be an easy feature if you wanted instant gratification - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1834
[13:24:59] <toddmparker> need a name…data-clear-btn="true" ?
[13:29:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think I've already created such a feature in web-ui-fw ...
[13:30:03] * _|Nix|_ go look that up :)
[13:32:11] <toddmparker> yeah? cool
[13:32:26] <uGoMobi> johnbender _|Nix|_ : do you guys think we should resolve this in the framework or not? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5255
[13:32:31] <toddmparker> seems like we already have the clear button built, juts need an option to inject it for more text input types
[13:32:42] <toddmparker> hardest part may be positioning it, maybe uGoMobi can help
[13:33:15] <johnbender> uGoMobi: even if we did I would make that the absolute last priority
[13:33:17] <uGoMobi> would the position be different from what we use for search?
[13:33:22] <johnbender> of all priorities ever
[13:33:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: IINM, I ended up copying the search button and just changing the icon.
[13:33:28] <uGoMobi> johnbender: :D
[13:33:43] <johnbender> too much hyperbole but you get my point
[13:34:03] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I think I will just close it now because I am sure if I don't it will be still open in a year and I will close it anyway
[13:34:12] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: probably not, tho the search input is round and others aren't so we might need a bit more spacing so it doesn't clash
[13:34:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ah I see
[13:34:52] <uGoMobi> sure I can take a look at that
[13:34:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't believe 5255 is a bug. The reporter should check event.target to distinguish between events that bubble and those that do not.
[13:35:08] <toddmparker> it'll be a tiny thing at most uGoMobi
[13:35:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Messing with the event propagation is to be avoided.
[13:35:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok thanks for feedback
[13:35:47] <uGoMobi> I already showed how he can resolve it just wanted to check before closing
[13:36:24] <ryanneufeld> silly question, but if I disable ajax page loads, I can still enable it on specific links yes?
[13:39:10] <toddmparker> so should we close _|Nix|_
[13:39:14] <toddmparker> I see you left it open.
[13:39:51] <toddmparker> ryanneufeld: not sure you can, I'd have to check that
[13:40:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Close.
[13:40:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and closed.
[13:41:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: grrr ... I was just typing
[13:41:25] <uGoMobi> and then you closed it
[13:41:28] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:41:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You can still make your comment.
[13:41:51] <uGoMobi> nah it's ok
[13:41:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry - did you lose what you typed?
[13:42:27] <_|Nix|_> I guess this bug is more about user education than framework shortcomings.
[13:42:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nah, I just deleted the two lines
[13:43:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Perhaps a demo illustrating how to make the distinction ... *shrug*
[13:43:11] <toddmparker> johnbender: see ryanneufeld's question above ^^
[13:43:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree, but people that file complete bug reports like that get a nice answer from me :)
[13:43:26] <toddmparker> yeah, that was a nice report
[13:43:44] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: you can disable ajax on specific links I'm not sure if the converse is true
[13:44:56] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: darn, cause that's what I'd like to do
[13:45:16] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: can you test it and let us know if it works? :)
[13:45:30] <ryanneufeld> yes
[13:45:30] <ryanneufeld> I can
[13:46:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Xa7uCA
[13:46:16] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/master f242daa Gabriel Schulhof: [controlgroup] New option: "corners": boolean: default: true
[13:47:23] <uGoMobi> we have to make sure we document all options that we add
[13:47:34] <uGoMobi> if we wait too long we probably forget
[13:48:00] <toddmparker> right, that's why it would be good if you guys jotted notes into that change log for a start
[13:48:14] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.3-Release-Notes
[13:48:20] <toddmparker> yeah, that
[13:48:30] <uGoMobi> that's what I could come up with
[13:48:50] <toddmparker> we should really just communicate these to agcolom because the API docs should be updated
[13:49:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to css-corner-styling: http://git.io/Kbg8sA
[13:49:14] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/css-corner-styling 1464f3f Gabriel Schulhof: Merge branch 'master' into css-corner-styling...
[13:49:30] <toddmparker> guess we could quickly update the current docs for good measure too since it will be a while before we switch
[13:49:50] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: BOOM. That merged in all the new corner stuff?
[13:50:04] <toddmparker> did Listview data-filter-reveal land too? I gotta keep up
[13:51:33] <uGoMobi> added two more
[13:51:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Here are all our options: https://docs.google.com/a/intel.com/document/d/1n7ozvhQTLhBj6sPR-LYxuev3p8kcbHjlAM8EBMlQ8GE/edit
[13:52:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'd actually ask that we go over that doc and mark some options as defaults so we can close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4974
[13:53:09] <_|Nix|_> Once the docs is filled out, I'll move all the options to defaults objects.
[13:53:23] <_|Nix|_> Like, for instance, initSelector has no business being part of the options.
[13:53:37] <_|Nix|_> Then, we have some options whose values are functions!
[13:53:47] <_|Nix|_> Those would be better off as behaviours.
[13:54:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good idea... you bring it up at the meeting tomorrow?
[13:54:56] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: nope, doesn't work.
[13:55:14] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: thanks for testing
[13:55:28] <ryanneufeld> but prefetching does
[13:55:42] <ryanneufeld> so adding data-prefetch still works with ajax disabled
[13:55:50] <ryanneufeld> good for menus
[13:56:51] <toddmparker> ryanneufeld: I figured.
[13:57:23] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: re: initSelector has no business being part of the options.
[13:57:53] <toddmparker> what's the plan on that? we do need a way for people to configure what selectors are used to init widgets, right?
[13:58:06] <toddmparker> just curious. maybe make an issue with info?
[13:58:26] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, $.mobile.<widgetname>.defaults.initSelector = ".whatever";
[13:58:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Instead of $.mobile.<widgetname>.prototype.options.initSelector = ".whatever";
[13:59:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We have waaay too many options, some of which are merely designed to be set during mobileinit, rather than on a per-widget basis. Those options should be moved to defaults.
[14:00:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the point is that you won't set this option when you call a plugin or with a data- attribute on the element, right?
[14:00:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or, later on with .widgetname( "option", "name", newValue ) - that's right.
[14:00:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... so why have it be an option at all?
[14:01:51] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: initSelector is a particularly blatant example of this, because it is completely useless as an option, since it doesn't influence the behaviour/look/feel of a widget at all. It merely decides whether there's gonna be a widget or not.
[14:02:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, once the widget is created, it's not like you can change your mind by changing the value of the widget's initSelector option :)
[14:04:29] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: thanks for creating a ticket for that
[14:04:53] <ryanneufeld> np
[14:05:01] <ryanneufeld> lemme know if you need more data
[14:06:39] <_|Nix|_> Here's another funny one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5249
[14:06:58] <_|Nix|_> Like, "so, make sure there are no errors" ... right?
[14:07:24] <_|Nix|_> I mean ... do we need to bulletproof that?
[14:07:43] <_|Nix|_> ... with, like a try{} block?
[14:08:07] <_|Nix|_> ... but I digress, and drag myself to bed slightly earlier ... L8R all!
[14:09:33] <ryanneufeld> oh, here's a strange one
[14:09:55] <ryanneufeld> I have an anchor say href="/nav/page.html"
[14:10:07] <ryanneufeld> and I use prefetch on that with ajax disabled
[14:10:29] <ryanneufeld> it prefetches the page, but then all the root relative urls later in the page, are relative to /nav/
[14:11:21] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: we rewrite the base when you pull in a new page so that the assets can be referenced relatively
[14:12:11] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: so if the page is loaded by itself the links still work
[14:13:05] <ryanneufeld> they don't work though, that's the problem...
[14:13:31] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: what don't work?
[14:14:08] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: jquery mobile doesn't support urls for an entire application being relative to the initial page load domain
[14:14:09] <ryanneufeld> the links
[14:14:27] <ryanneufeld> so every link has to be fully qualified?
[14:14:27] <johnbender> I have a branch that disables the base tag rewriting but it needs work
[14:14:30] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: no
[14:14:55] <johnbender> it has to be relative to the location of the document on which it exists or use a full path to the domain
[14:15:01] <ryanneufeld> So I have anchors on my page that are /something.html
[14:15:12] <ryanneufeld> and i have some that are /somedir/something.html
[14:15:25] <ryanneufeld> when I prefetch the /somedir/something.html
[14:15:35] <ryanneufeld> all the links become /somedir/something.html
[14:15:44] <ryanneufeld> which makes them broken.
[14:15:57] <johnbender> where do they "become" like that
[14:16:00] <johnbender> on the fetched page?
[14:16:07] <ryanneufeld> I first load
[14:16:13] <ryanneufeld> *on
[14:16:44] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: hmm, if you could whip up an example this might be easier
[14:16:59] * ryanneufeld opens fiddle
[14:19:03] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/BXJa8/
[14:19:08] <ryanneufeld> that's the html I'm using
[14:19:14] <ryanneufeld> though I can't prefetch the links
[14:19:32] <ryanneufeld> lemme see if I can get this up on our dev box
[14:20:41] <johnbender> k
[14:24:10] <ryanneufeld> http://ryan.beta.metrolyrics.com/
[14:24:12] <ryanneufeld> does that work?
[14:31:03] <ryanneufeld> bah
[14:31:12] <ryanneufeld> this is harder than it should be
[14:33:39] <toddmparker> ryanneufeld: I just don't think this was designed for that scenario but we can look at improving this
[14:33:56] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I think it's a bug
[14:34:04] <toddmparker> if ajax nag was off at the global level, flipping it on for a few pages is trickier than it may seem
[14:34:16] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:34:18] <ryanneufeld> that's okay
[14:34:25] <toddmparker> think it's less of a bug than a planned limitation
[14:34:27] <ryanneufeld> the problem I'm having now is with prefetching
[14:34:28] <toddmparker> but yeah
[14:36:06] <ryanneufeld> oh, of course, once i get the demo working
[14:36:16] <ryanneufeld> it doesn't do what it was doing to me
[14:37:49] <ryanneufeld> okay, so that's odd, it's not doing it on one server, but it is doing it locally...
[14:37:51] <ryanneufeld> wtf
[14:47:11] <toddmparker> that ajax nag thing?
[14:48:15] <ryanneufeld> nav thing?
[14:48:16] <ryanneufeld> http://ryan.beta.metrolyrics.com/someone-like-you-lyrics-adele.html
[14:48:20] <ryanneufeld> if you open that
[14:48:23] <ryanneufeld> then refresh the page
[14:48:49] <ryanneufeld> all the links under "Other '21' songs" will have /navigation/ prefixed to the urls
[14:48:57] <ryanneufeld> which leaves them broken
[14:49:04] <ryanneufeld> if I turn off prefetching it works
[14:49:33] <ryanneufeld> I thought it would be nice to prefetch the nav, since we're not using ajax on the rest of the site
[14:51:45] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: cc
[14:53:34] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: what do you mean by prefetch
[14:53:45] <johnbender> we have the concept in jquery mobile too
[14:53:45] <ryanneufeld> data-prefetch on a link
[14:53:54] <ryanneufeld> That is the concept I'm using
[14:54:11] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: does the page you loaded have a base tag?
[14:54:24] <ryanneufeld> no
[14:54:44] <johnbender> there might be some weird interaction with the prefetch that's rewriting the urls in the current page but I'd find that odd
[14:54:49] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: log a bug I guess :(
[14:55:09] <ryanneufeld> it works fine the first time you load it
[14:55:17] <ryanneufeld> then on a refresh it has prolems
[14:55:20] <ryanneufeld> *problems
[14:55:34] <ryanneufeld> ugh, all this to make ads work
[14:55:48] <ryanneufeld> cause, people who write ad js are idiots
[14:56:10] <johnbender> don't be so sure that we aren't the idiots
[14:56:16] <johnbender> it wouldn't be the first time :)
[14:56:35] <toddmparker> people who write ad js are idiots << +1,000
[15:05:03] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: you guys are WAY effing smarter than the pinheads document.writing ads
[15:07:11] <toddmparker> we run into that a lot
[15:07:25] <toddmparker> we stuff ads into frames to quarantine 'em
[15:07:34] <ryanneufeld> I tried that
[15:07:47] <ryanneufeld> seems if you just wrap them in an iframe it doesn't work
[15:07:54] <ryanneufeld> I haven't really tried another way
[15:09:24] <ryanneufeld> if you have any suggestions. I'm open to them
[15:20:37] <toddmparker> ryanneufeld: not sure if we have public code, i'll look
[15:21:24] <ryanneufeld> Thanks toddmparker
[15:55:30] <toddmparker> ok, heading home. Goodnight!
