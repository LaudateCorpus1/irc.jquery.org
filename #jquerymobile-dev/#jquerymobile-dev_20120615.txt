[08:54:21] <gseguin> Good morning!
[09:05:50] <johnbender> gseguin: looking good
[09:06:56] <gseguin> johnbender: sorry for the pending PR on these files
[09:07:03] <johnbender> ?
[09:07:04] <johnbender> ah
[09:07:05] <gseguin> they can't be merged automatically
[09:07:09] <johnbender> whatever
[09:07:17] <johnbender> doesn't bother me much
[09:07:41] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm planning to go through and clean up our test suite files names
[09:07:45] <johnbender> we've got some inconsistency there
[09:07:50] <johnbender> buttonMarkup
[09:07:54] <johnbender> page-sections
[09:07:59] <gseguin> good idea
[09:08:18] <gseguin> also having the same structure as js/ would be cool
[09:09:10] <johnbender> gseguin: indeed
[09:09:28] <johnbender> not sure if I'll deal with that just yet
[09:09:33] <johnbender> but you're right
[09:41:18] <Wilto> Hey guys.
[09:43:59] <gseguin> 'sup Wilto
[09:48:46] <Wilto> It has been so long, jQM!
[09:49:05] <gseguin> I know! who are you by the way?
[09:49:18] <Wilto> I DONâ€™T KNOW ANYMORE
[09:49:21] <gseguin> :P
[09:51:51] <agcolom> hey everyone :-)
[09:53:37] <johnbender> Wilto: welcome back: http://vimeo.com/44085271
[09:53:43] <johnbender> lulz
[09:53:54] <agcolom> quick question... iframe... Is that something we should NEVER use (or is it me just having bad feelings about it?)
[09:54:12] <johnbender> agcolom: I _love_ iframes
[09:54:16] <johnbender> but I'm alone in that :(
[09:54:30] <johnbender> that is, I love iframes for specific things
[09:54:35] <johnbender> presentations
[09:54:36] <johnbender> sandboxing
[09:54:38] <johnbender> etc
[09:54:44] <agcolom> It used to be very badly supported, but I don't know now...
[09:55:13] <agcolom> It'd be such an easy solution for the new api docs inline examples....
[09:55:42] <agcolom> it is widely supported now?
[09:56:01] <agcolom> johnbender ^
[09:56:41] <johnbender> agcolom: I've had some minor issues using jqm in iframes in my presentations even on chrome :(
[09:56:53] <agcolom> :-(
[09:57:02] <agcolom> even basic examples?
[09:57:43] <agcolom> (basic widget demos, like we have in the docs)
[10:01:47] <johnbender> agcolom: well, I've only ever done it with chrome and I had problems with history leaking out of the iframe
[10:01:53] <johnbender> or at least that's what it appeared to be doing
[10:01:57] <johnbender> history actions that is
[10:02:05] <johnbender> going back would cause the parent page to jump
[10:02:07] <johnbender> things like that
[10:02:26] <johnbender> although I would point out that the iframes were embedded in an html slide show
[10:02:31] <johnbender> so the css was shady to start with
[10:02:45] <johnbender> might be worth a little testing
[10:03:10] <johnbender> agcolom: also depends on whether mobile devices will be viewing the docs
[10:03:19] <johnbender> in which case you'd likely want to remove those iframes
[10:03:30] <johnbender> and replace them with links
[10:57:50] <agcolom> johnbender... yes, the other solution I was thinking of was to add JQM to the docs but currently I do not have access to where the body tag goes and I cannot add the div data-role="page" so the js is executed twice and if I have inline demos they appear twice!!! That's my preferred solution as should all work fine on mobile as well...
[10:58:31] <agcolom> We have a meeting with Richard this evening so hopefully we'll be able to sort that out...
[10:58:41] <agcolom> Thanks for the iframe info :-)
[10:59:04] <johnbender> agcolom: np, it's worth a try I think
[10:59:33] <johnbender> agcolom: thinking about it, the css for the slides that I was embedding the iframes in was pretty crazy
[10:59:39] <johnbender> and I had something like 20+ iframes in one page
[10:59:47] <johnbender> it was crazytown
[10:59:58] <agcolom> I see ;-)
[10:59:59] * johnbender is Coocoo for iFramePuffs
[11:00:17] <agcolom> :-)
[11:21:36] <johnbender> toddparker: you and your documentation!
[11:21:36] <johnbender> lol
[11:21:41] <johnbender> very good idea though
[11:21:59] <johnbender> agcolom: toddparker: this is a good question for you both
[11:22:09] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2190#issuecomment-6348625
[11:22:24] <johnbender> can I change the title of the page to Phonegap/WebView ?
[11:22:30] <johnbender> title and links
[11:22:49] <johnbender> or should I even bother

[11:36:42] <johnbender> toddparker: agcolom: pushed ^
[11:44:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I got the stats to work, but not the visualization.
[11:44:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nice
[11:44:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The perms on the db were making it read-only to the php.
[11:44:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: is the filament groups graphing lib working?
[11:44:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think the problem is that the query is returning no records.
[11:45:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Even though I have 16 in the table.
[11:45:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: to be totally frank
[11:45:33] <johnbender> the snippet that builds the graphs is a complete steaming pile of dung
[11:45:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was thinking that the table could use a commitid.
[11:46:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: anything that you think about that visualize page would make it better
[11:46:14] <johnbender> I'm sure of it
[11:46:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Currently it has a date column, but that's not really useful ...
[11:46:20] <johnbender> so... very... bad
[11:46:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I once wrote a graphing thing in ... wait for it ... php :)
[11:47:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah I did it all in js to make it backend agnostic but feel free to do what you like
[11:47:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Might try my luck at this one ...
[11:47:16] <johnbender> as long as the graphs are easy to understand/read
[11:47:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was thinking commitid on the X axis, and time-it-took on the Y axis ...
[11:48:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you mean the hash?
[11:48:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah.
[11:48:21] <johnbender> if you can fit it, then be my guest
[11:48:29] <_|Nix|_> Of course, shortened to the first 7 digits.
[11:48:34] <johnbender> sounds good
[11:48:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ... sounds like a project.
[11:48:57] <johnbender> sounds like an awesome project
[11:49:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we'll probably revisit all this again soon
[11:49:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It does.
[11:49:09] <johnbender> perf is on the radar for sure
[11:49:19] <johnbender> and we need regression testing for that to be effective
[11:49:32] <johnbender> I've got some ideas but not well formed yet
[11:49:36] <_|Nix|_> Definitely.
[11:50:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I dunno about that polling for commitid change though ... I think the test run should be more like the unit tests. You make a conscious effort to open the test pages and then look at the graphs. I think the look-for-when-there's-a-commitid-change is superfluous.
[11:51:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well we can easily automate visiting the test pages with browserstack
[11:51:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Anyhow, I'll try to get cranking on this.
[11:51:42] <johnbender> so we can do it as little or as often as we like
[11:51:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool
[11:52:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I wasn't thinking about the CI so much as the run-this-before-you-push-to-github workflow.
[11:52:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we are, or were, having a hard enough time getting people to do that for tests
[11:52:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I always wait for the unit tests to pass before I push to github. Now, I would also run this if I thought it would be relevant.
[11:53:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The same goes for the linting ...
[11:53:28] <johnbender> not a bad idea but I think it's probably enough to burden people with the responsibility of correctness and let the CI tell us if we've hit a perf snag
[11:53:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That should also be run.
[11:53:36] <johnbender> CI imo
[11:53:44] <johnbender> well
[11:53:46] <johnbender> actually
[11:53:47] <johnbender> I take that back
[11:53:55] <johnbender> the linting can be done as a pre-commit hook
[11:54:03] <johnbender> so that can be automated in a different way
[11:54:20] <johnbender> extra steps or manual intervention encourages apathy
[11:54:32] <johnbender> the tests are sort of a must
[11:54:48] <johnbender> but the other stuff can wait or be automated for the developer
[11:54:58] <johnbender> my 2c
[11:55:06] <johnbender> I mean it would be great if everyone did all these things
[11:55:11] <johnbender> and I'd be fine with that
[11:55:29] <johnbender> but I'm something of a stickler for that stuff
[11:57:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Does git have a pre-push hook? I mean, I make lots of little commits, squash them, rebase them, ammend them, etc, so having this run on each new commit would totally drag me down. Before a push, OTOH, I'd be totally fine with this.
[11:59:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, and what's the difference between the agent and agent_full fields?
[11:59:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: one is for grouping
[11:59:19] <johnbender> the other is for debugging
[11:59:28] <Wilto> johnbender: AAAAH MATHS
[11:59:41] <johnbender> Wilto: it's totally approachable man
[12:00:00] <Wilto> I will do my best.
[12:00:09] <johnbender> Wilto: and I'd actually really like your feedback on that very thing if you can spare the time
[12:00:24] <Wilto> Absolutely, dude. Might not be until later on this evening; todayâ€™s kind of insane.
[12:00:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I assume agent_full is more precise that agent ... so does that mean that agent_full tends to break the aggregation?
[12:00:34] <johnbender> Wilto: whenever you get time
[12:00:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: exactly
[12:00:54] <johnbender> it's not properly normalized but the substring functions in sqlite suck
[12:01:18] <johnbender> that is agent is functionally dependent on agent_full but without custom string handling I couldn't do it
[12:01:27] <johnbender> so the custome handling got moved into the client side js
[12:01:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, OK ...
[12:02:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/blob/master/speed/stats/perf.js#L73
[12:02:35] <johnbender> not sure if you can see that
[12:02:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I may not have access to that ... remember?
[12:02:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's at the bottom of the stats/perf.js
[12:03:16] <Wilto> Hey, anyone have a couple minutes free to confirm https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4462 ?
[12:03:16] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-mobile by alexksso (2w, 5d ago): slide flickering within a ios app webview (i.e. phonegap container)
[12:03:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I see it.
[12:03:48] <Wilto> I just ran it through iOS 5/6, and it didnâ€™t seem much different â€” I wasnâ€™t getting any real flickering in either case.
[12:04:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: not super usefull information but I don't want anyone thinking that I don't know how to normalize a damn DB!!!
[12:04:19] * johnbender laughs nervously
[12:04:32] <Wilto> We talkinâ€™ about Drum and Bass in here?
[12:04:43] <Wilto> He said, intentionally oblivious.
[12:04:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Relax ... I totally don't remember anything from my DB course ...
[12:05:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It was oh so many moons ago ...
[12:06:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I was a dba/plsql hacker at my first job
[12:07:02] <johnbender> _invaluable_ experience
[12:07:55] <johnbender> especially given all the overhyping around nosql by people who's only interactiong with a relational database comes from mysql hidden by an orm (most likely ActiveRecord)
[12:08:06] <johnbender> n00bs!
[12:08:12] * johnbender is sort of joking
[12:08:40] <Wilto> oh my god what is all this
[12:08:52] <Wilto> are you guys trying to scare me away again
[12:10:07] <Wilto> johnbender: Is this link sharable with the masses?
[12:15:23] <agcolom> johnbender: sorry I was off (having dinner!)
[12:15:26] <johnbender> Wilto: the video?
[12:15:34] <Wilto> Yeah.
[12:15:34] <johnbender> agcolom: ah no worries
[12:15:39] <johnbender> Wilto: absolutely
[12:15:42] <johnbender> I tweeted it
[12:16:21] <agcolom> johnbender you want  to change a page title?
[12:18:06] <johnbender> agcolom: meh, I can and it might make sense but it might now
[12:18:08] <johnbender> *not
[12:18:11] <johnbender> one sec
[12:18:28] <johnbender> agcolom: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/phonegap.html
[12:18:30] <johnbender> down at the bottom
[12:18:56] <johnbender> that's only related to phone gap in so far as phonegap also uses a uiwebview on iOS but it handles all that for you
[12:18:56] <agcolom> yes, I saw that... (non phonegap in phonegap)
[12:19:19] <johnbender> if it will make it easier for people to find that info then I can certainly update the docs
[12:19:50] <agcolom> we can add ios to the search term of that page if it is not already there...
[12:19:59] <agcolom> I'll check...
[12:20:37] <agcolom> yes, ios is not a search term for that page. Could add iOS and webview?
[12:20:47] <agcolom> and uiwebview
[12:21:16] <agcolom> in term of title... native apps?
[12:21:31] <agcolom> Building native applications with jQuery Mobile
[12:22:01] <agcolom> One section with Phone Gap
[12:22:11] <agcolom> One section with UIWebView ?
[12:24:32] <agcolom> you know the way some widgets have the control group with basics/options/methods/events we could have Building native applications with jQuery Mobile as title and teh controlgroup buttons would say PhoneGap (default) and UIWebView
[12:24:42] <agcolom> then it's easy as well to add more
[12:25:10] <agcolom> What do you think?
[12:32:25] <agcolom> johnbender: toddparker: What do you think of this proposal?
[12:45:52] <johnbender> agcolom: sounds fine to me
[12:46:02] <johnbender> the search bit solves my problem
[12:46:04] <johnbender> I'll add that now
[12:46:24] <johnbender> agcolom: hmm unless I can't figure out how to do that!
[12:46:26] <johnbender> :(
[12:46:28] <johnbender> agcolom: link?
[12:46:52] <agcolom> yes... holdon
[12:47:31] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/nav.html
[12:48:27] <agcolom> I can do it now quickly if you want...
[12:48:43] <agcolom> I'm on the page...
[12:50:44] <agcolom> actually uiwebview is a search term already so we just need to add 'native' and 'ios'
[12:56:30] <johnbender> agcolom: cool
[12:56:36] <johnbender> agcolom: where is that information stored?
[12:59:34] <agcolom> it's the data-filtertext in the li
[13:00:03] <agcolom> I'll make the change now, and you'll be able to see...
