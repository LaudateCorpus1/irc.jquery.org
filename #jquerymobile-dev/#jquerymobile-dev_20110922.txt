[06:15:56] <toddparker> hi all
[06:17:02] <toddparker> hi all
[06:17:11] <toddparker> there an echo in here?
[06:20:54] <toddparker> should i say this is something we'd look at post-1.0? Is there already a way to do this?
[06:20:55] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2504
[06:20:56] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by VilleSalonen (45m, 9s ago): Bug 2503: Added ability to specify custom error handler function
[08:16:24] <toddparker> kinblas - thoughts on this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/734

[08:55:13] <_nickel> last test run then I'm going to push the scrolling fix
[09:13:37] <gseguin> hiya!
[09:15:30] <gseguin> wow toddparker, you're on a closing spree!
[09:23:40] <toddparker> I will close all issues today
[09:23:46] <toddparker> there is a ton of cruft
[09:25:07] <_nickel> toddparker: kinblas_ one thing you guys might want to double check is that that transitions are ok still given the new scrolling
[09:26:10] <toddparker> _nickel: in iOS5?
[09:33:39] <_nickel> toddparker: ios seemed to be fine and so did android
[09:33:43] <_nickel> but I don't know what the expectation is
[09:38:20] <toddparker> _nickel: the new scrolling only kicks in on iOS5, so the other platforms work as the did before
[09:38:28] <toddparker> but am I missing something?
[09:38:32] <toddparker> sorry if I'm being thick
[09:43:16] <_nickel> toddparker: sorry I fixed the scroll position between pages
[09:43:30] <_nickel> toddparker: it wasn't working in some browsers because of the hashchange timing
[09:43:47] <_nickel> toddparker: so its not scroll overfow, but rather scroll position recall
[09:45:18] <toddparker> what should we do with this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1499
[09:45:18] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1499 on jquery-mobile, reported by StevenBlack (5m, 1d ago): Suggestion: $.mobile.navigation.js -- $.mobile.urlHistory.directHashChange() - Bail from $.each() asap
[09:49:32] <_nickel> looking
[09:50:02] <_nickel> toddparker: we can't do that
[09:50:18] <_nickel> because we itterate forward in the history
[09:50:33] <_nickel> if there are 2 pages in the history stack with the same url then it will choose the first one which is farther back in time
[09:51:13] <_nickel> toddparker: we still need to change that algo to work outward from the current url and not the naive itteration that its doing now
[09:51:46] <_nickel> toddparker: posting to that and closing
[09:51:58] <Wilto> Gentlemen.

[10:03:34] <toddparker> cool beans

[10:08:49] <_nickel> so if jenkins seems chatty you guys can ignore him for now
[10:13:44] <gseguin> toddparker: oh you mean have a different theme between collapsible in the same set?
[10:13:55] <gseguin> I haven't tried

[10:38:04] <_nickel> gseguin: did the core tests passed when you were woking on jqmData?
[10:38:19] <_nickel> its failing consistently for me
[10:38:31] <_nickel> with rather odd results
[10:41:28] <gseguin> _nickel: yes sir
[10:41:40] <gseguin> really ?
[10:41:46] <gseguin> which one is failing?
[10:53:07] <_nickel> gseguin: well I would show you on test, but qunit seems to have lost its mind
[10:53:30] <_nickel> I suspect a merge conflict
[10:53:37] <_nickel> gseguin: do you have it running locally?
[10:54:08] <_nickel> gseguin: $.fn.jqmData and $.fn.jqmRemoveData methods are working properly (1, 9, 10)
[10:54:29] <gseguin> let me switch branch and try it
[10:56:01] <gseguin> yeah I got some failures
[10:56:11] <gseguin> I'll look into it
[10:56:21] <_nickel> gseguin: thanks much sir!
[10:57:13] <gseguin> sorry about that

[13:06:45] <kinblas> Wilto: nevermind, my IRC window was scrolled up and I thought you just pinged us
[13:07:39] <toddparker> hi all
[13:07:47] <kinblas> toddparker: hey
[13:07:50] <toddparker> are people around to talk bout planning?
[13:11:34] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm here
[13:11:47] <gseguin> I'm kindda here
[13:21:04] <toddparker> hi, sorry
[13:21:26] <toddparker> ok, so kinblas I just wanted to get a sense from you of what adobe is expecting
[13:21:58] <kinblas> toddparker: we were looking for 1.0 ... but it's alright, I just talked to folks
[13:22:02] <kinblas> as long as we're close
[13:22:04] <kinblas> rc1
[13:22:07] <kinblas> I think we're ok
[13:22:38] <toddparker> we gotta do what's right, but i appreciate that abode has a lot riding on this
[13:22:54] <toddparker> we could try for an RC early next week
[13:23:14] <toddparker> and even do a second one on thu/fri
[13:23:27] <toddparker> the issue is that we're all going to be tied up that week
[13:23:48] <toddparker> so i'd hate to do an RC, then another a few days alter, then stall for over a week
[13:24:09] <toddparker> biggest question i have is whether you guys see any of these issues as true blockers
[13:24:26] <toddparker> btw - mat marquis hère is cranking thru fixes
[13:24:34] <toddparker> just fixed 2 things
[13:40:23] <Wilto> Whatup.
[13:40:35] <Wilto> Just trying to knock out some of the quick CSS fixes.
[13:41:15] <_nickel> eddiemonge: nothing
[13:41:17] <_nickel> I'll look now
[13:41:25] <Wilto> Also, flailing helplessly at git—apologies in advance for any repeated pull requests.
[13:41:34] <_nickel>  /js is failing to lead
[13:41:37] <_nickel> *load
[13:44:26] <gseguin> _nickel: I'm taking care of these core tests right now
[13:46:31] <toddparker> btw winto is Mat here at Filament
[13:46:34] <toddparker> wilto
[13:46:59] <Wilto> Good meetin’ you guys!
[13:48:22] <toddparker> he is a css zen master
[13:48:26] <kinblas> Wilto: welcome!
[13:50:32] <toddparker> ps, my laptop ran out of power
[13:50:37] <toddparker> ok, back now
[13:55:04] <_nickel> gseguin: cool
[13:55:12] <_nickel> gseguin: are you able to view the tests locally
[13:55:21] <_nickel> the php changes broke my server :(
[13:55:21] <gseguin> yeah yeah
[13:55:30] <gseguin> I don't understand how I missed that
[13:55:39] <gseguin> yeah it's super slow
[13:55:48] <gseguin> should I back out that patch?
[13:56:09] <gseguin> here is another reason why I would like to move to AMD
[13:56:33] <_nickel> gseguin: if I take out the gzip code it works
[13:56:34] <gseguin> all you need with RequireJS is an http server
[13:57:02] <_nickel> eddiemonge: is the gzipping code essential?
[13:57:12] <_nickel> I have no php experience so I don't know how to debug that
[13:57:53] <_nickel> also should combine.php have a closing ?>
[13:57:55] <_nickel>  ?
[13:58:34] <kinblas> _nickel: in php the closing ?> is optional
[13:58:42] <kinblas> they use it to prevent trailing whitespace
[13:58:46] <kinblas> and for some other reason
[13:58:59] <_nickel> kinblas: interesting
[14:00:04] <TehShrike|Work> And to make syntax highlighters happy :-P
[14:00:29] <_nickel> gseguin: well thats the fix for me but that doesn't mean I've done anything productive
[14:00:39] <_nickel> we should make sure the eddie isn't depending on that for some reason or another
[14:01:16] * gseguin tries without the gzip thinggy
[14:01:57] <gseguin> yeah it's much faster without it

[14:14:44] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Fixes #1392 — Positions .ui-icon on lower z-index than .ui-btn-text, ensuring the click will register on the latter.
[14:17:36] <_nickel> just waiting to hear back from eddie on that combine.php issue and then hopefully we can sort out the issues with the build servr rightn ow
[14:17:45] <_nickel> don't want to ship 1.0rc1 without the tests passing
[14:18:47] <gseguin> _nickel: my code got backed out
[14:19:12] <gseguin> that's why tests are failing
[14:20:56] * gseguin takes that back
[14:38:21] <eddiemonge> yeah the gzip part can be dropped
[14:38:33] <eddiemonge> that was mostly for the cdn
[14:40:03] <_nickel> eddiemonge: kk
[14:40:41] <eddiemonge> not sure why it would break on your server though
[14:41:11] <_nickel> no idea
[14:41:17] <_nickel> I'm using apache and mod php
[14:41:22] * _nickel shrugs
[14:41:29] <eddiemonge> does the jquerymobile.com/test work for you?
[14:41:34] <_nickel> no
[14:43:58] <eddiemonge> i dont think its the gzip part
[14:44:14] <eddiemonge> one sec
[14:46:07] <eddiemonge> now try /test
[14:48:04] <toddparker> guys, is this s 1.0 blocker? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2413

[14:48:22] <toddparker> or is tho just a chrome bug for an edge case?
[14:48:31] <toddparker> not a blocker now
[14:48:37] <toddparker> not flagg for RC
[14:48:41] <toddparker> should it?
[14:51:34] <kinblas> toddparker: it's a bug in chrome
[14:52:25] <_nickel> I dont *think* there's a way to address that either
[14:52:32] <_nickel> and it is a corner case imo
[14:52:34] <_nickel> toddparker: ^
[14:52:43] <kinblas> toddparker: it happens when you cross to a non-ajax page and then hit back button
[14:53:18] <kinblas> toddparker: we should have a flag (waiting for browser fix)
[14:53:34] <kinblas> we have a few bugs that are waiting on browser vendors
[14:56:21] <eddiemonge> _nickel: did the change i make fix the loading on jquerymobile.com/test ?
[14:58:46] <kinblas> _nickel: ping
[14:59:32] <kinblas> _nickel: so do we have any utilities in the test source for simulating mouse events .. in particular generating mouse events with coordinates in them?
[14:59:55] <kinblas> I have a bug that I fixed but it only happens with mousedown/mouseup
[15:00:01] <kinblas> so I want to add it to the unit test.
[15:00:16] <kinblas> unfortunately slider code relies on pageX/Y in the event
[15:00:41] <kinblas> _nickel: I can code something up but just wanted to check if something already exists.
[15:02:12] <_nickel> eddiemonge: not sure since I pushed my fix as well
[15:02:25] <_nickel> kinblas: don't thinkg so
[15:02:36] <_nickel> kinblas: just the vanilla jquery methods
[15:02:52] <_nickel> I take it you need something more complex?
[15:03:11] <kinblas> _nickel: I just need to click on a toggle switch
[15:03:32] <_nickel> kinblas: I just use the jquery method in my tests
[15:03:32] <kinblas> _nickel: but I need pageX/Y values on the event that gets dispatched
[15:03:40] <_nickel> ah
[15:04:04] <kinblas> _nickel: Yeah unfortunately the codepath in refresh()
[15:04:10] <kinblas> requres an event to be passed
[15:05:17] <_nickel> kinblas: helper it is then?
[15:05:49] <kinblas> _nickel: I think I can fake it by creating my own event and getting the offset() of the slider
[15:08:10] <gseguin> _nickel: I just pushed the fix for core tests
[15:10:47] <_nickel> gseguin: sweet
[15:11:19] <_nickel> gseguin: now I just need to fix that checkbox radio issue
[15:11:23] <_nickel> whatever it may be
[15:11:32] <_nickel> gseguin: oh did you grab that one about the labels?
[15:11:35] <_nickel> err
[15:11:37] <_nickel> disabled?
[15:11:44] <_nickel> I think Todd assigned that one to you
[15:11:46] <_nickel> they might be related
[15:14:49] <gseguin> _nickel: labels?
[15:15:35] <_nickel> gseguin: I'm fuzzing on the subject matter but I think there was a radio button bug assigned to you
[15:16:15] <gseguin> oh the native form elements showing below the enhanced ones?
[15:16:50] <_nickel> gseguin: no I don't think that was it
[15:16:55] <_nickel> I'll take a look into the failing test then
[15:17:02] <_nickel> I must be thinking of something else
[15:17:03] <gseguin> hmmm do you have an issue #?

[18:24:41] <scottjehl> updated. I need to take a break from it for a while and work on bugs hto
[18:29:07] <toddmparker> download builder ho!
[18:31:21] <scottjehl> hey toddmparker
[18:31:37] <scottjehl> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/1badd4aa8e5c67835b98eeddd93638a8ce514f90
[18:31:38] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by scottjehl (35.472s ago): enable touch overflow scrolling by default where supported
[18:32:12] <toddmparker>  cool beans. it's ON
[18:37:19] <scottjehl> nice - did you fill this page out more? http://localhost/jquery-mobile/docs/forms/forms-sample.html
[18:37:25] <scottjehl> woops local
[18:37:49] <scottjehl> jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/forms-sample.html
[18:46:46] <scottjehl> toddmparker this new? docs/forms/forms-sample-selfsubmit.php
[18:46:53] <scottjehl> not linked up I don't think
[18:46:58] <scottjehl> doesn't seem to be working either
[18:53:05] <scottjehl> hmm. uncovered a nav bug
[18:53:08] <scottjehl> from that demo
[18:53:46] <scottjehl> "get" works fine for self-submit, but post looks like the same url (no q params), so it's just reusing the initial page since it's already there
[18:54:03] <scottjehl> should be able to bypass that when it's a post
[18:54:06] <scottjehl> looking
[18:55:28] <toddmparker> that should be linked up
[18:55:35] <toddmparker> i jazzed up the styles, yeah
[18:55:51] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/forms-sample.html
[18:56:07] <toddmparker> (in the left nav)
[18:56:22] <scottjehl> I like the stylez
[18:56:29] <scottjehl> k found the condition
[19:00:22] <scottjehl> this is an interesting problem. if you post to a url, we don't expose any query string params like we would if it was a get
[19:00:57] <scottjehl> so, if I were to override the "this page is already in the dom" logic and make a new page from the post response, we'll have 2 pages with the same data-url
[19:02:03] <scottjehl> I sortof want to replace the former page with the new post response. not sure though
[19:05:50] <toddmparker> interesting
[19:05:57] <toddmparker> can you file a bug?
[19:07:17] <scottjehl> hmm well I think I've got a good answer
[19:08:08] <scottjehl> if request is post, we need to set settings.reloadPage to true so that the response replaces the duped page in the DOM.
[19:18:30] <toddmparker> makes sense
[19:18:40] <toddmparker> blog post: http://jquerymobile.com/?p=1598&preview=true

[19:19:11] <toddmparker> loooong list of changes

[19:42:13] <scottjehl> brb
[19:43:01] <nickel> scottjehl: yah you can see the test thats failing in the email
[19:43:10] <nickel> there should be no failures at /tests/unit/navigation/base-tests.html for firefox, failing test: can navigate between internal and external pages.
