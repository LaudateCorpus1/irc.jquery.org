[06:56:19] <Wilto> Morning, guys.
[07:19:12] <Wilto> You around yet, johnbender?
[07:24:04] <toddparker> we're here to help, or hug
[07:24:31] <toddparker> got the release notes for RC1 roughed out last night. Lot of fixes since alpha
[07:29:59] <toddparker> another popup link thing to look at: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4883
[07:31:21] <Wilto> Want me to take that one, toddparker?
[08:18:02] <toddparker> Wilto: sure
[08:56:16] <Wilto> On it.
[09:03:43] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm around
[09:03:55] <Wilto> Did you fix everything forever, johnbender?
[09:03:59] <Wilto> pleasesayyespleasesayyes
[09:04:08] <johnbender> lol
[09:04:09] <johnbender> no
[09:04:17] <johnbender> do you guys get my basecamp messages?
[09:04:26] <Wilto> Yeah man; this issue is chaos.
[09:05:26] <johnbender> BAM
[09:05:44] <Wilto> wait bam what bam
[09:09:40] <Wilto> ?boom
[09:09:41] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[09:11:50] <toddparker> is that a good BAM johnbender
[09:13:32] <gseguin> good morning
[09:13:54] <gseguin> BAM BOOM, lots of noises in this chat room
[09:15:43] <Wilto> I assume it’s a good sign.
[09:17:55] <johnbender> toddparker: yes, but nothing to do with popups :D
[09:18:09] <Wilto> Long as it ain’t bad.
[09:50:24] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: I have an idea
[09:50:36] * gseguin listens
[09:50:40] <Wilto> johnbender: http://wil.to/_/plan.gif
[09:50:45] <johnbender> we have to differentiate the ui-state addition to the hash
[09:50:57] <johnbender> ie is just sticking with the same value
[09:50:59] <johnbender> it's not reseting it
[09:51:03] <Wilto> Ah-hah.
[09:51:12] <johnbender> if that changes between popups we should be good to go
[09:51:22] <johnbender> should be pretty trivial to test
[09:51:26] <johnbender> give me a second
[09:53:09] <Wilto> John Bender, you magnificent bastard.
[09:53:49] <johnbender> Kin get's the credit
[09:53:58] <johnbender> he gave me the idea and I think that's what he was driving it
[09:53:59] <johnbender> *at
[09:54:13] <Wilto> kinblas, you similarly magnificent bastard.
[09:57:12] <toddparker> magnificance
[09:57:16] <toddparker> let me know!
[10:05:28] <johnbender> working on it
[10:05:38] <johnbender> some odd behavior whilst tacking on the popup id :/
[10:10:35] * johnbender is having a tough time figuring out what all this code does :(
[10:21:33] * johnbender sighs
[10:21:35] <johnbender> no luck
[10:22:11] <johnbender> changing to another page "resets" the scroll position though
[10:22:18] <johnbender> we just need to figure out how/why
[10:22:37] <toddparker> johnbender: you wanna join the call?
[10:23:40] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/4b643e94cdfd4cdb2f052b17d77be56dbe165898
[10:24:48] <johnbender> toddparker: ahh good idea
[10:24:52] <johnbender> sorry

[10:51:42] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #572: FAILURE in 34 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/572/
[10:57:04] <Wilto> Anyone know if the `popupcreate` event was intentionally removed at some point?
[10:57:16] <Wilto> _|Nix|_ isn’t gonna be around for a while, right?
[11:10:01] <gseguin> johnbender: I can take care of the GPL thingy if you'd like
[11:17:40] <johnbender> gseguin: seems to be sorted
[11:17:54] <gseguin> ok
[11:24:01] <Wilto> johnbender: You still here?
[11:25:28] <johnbender> Wilto: yes
[11:25:43] <Wilto> view-source:http://jsbin.com/itewam/1
[11:26:05] <Wilto> To your knowledge, has “popupcreate” ever been a thing?
[11:27:16] <johnbender> Wilto: it may have been
[11:27:23] <johnbender> we decided to simplify the popup alot
[11:27:40] <johnbender> Wilto: does the problem still occure on popupafteropen?
[11:28:02] <johnbender> Wilto: and in what browser does that freeze
[11:28:41] <Wilto> Not getting any freeze at all. It just doesn’t fire the “close” that they’re triggering.
[11:28:51] <johnbender> Wilto: in chrome?
[11:28:54] <johnbender> or where
[11:29:14] <johnbender> seems to work fine for me :/
[11:29:30] <Wilto> Oh, yeah. Chrome on Windows 7, the buttons don’t close it and then, afterwards, clicking the backdrop no longer closes it.
[11:29:39] <johnbender> the popupcreate might be a part of the widget lifecyle actually
[11:29:41] <Wilto> So it “freezes” in that respect, I guess.
[11:29:58] * johnbender is relatively sure it is
[11:30:07] <johnbender> definitely direct him to use the popupafteropen
[11:30:28] <johnbender> don't think that will solve his problem though
[11:31:14] <johnbender> Wilto: I'd imagine there's some timing corner case where the closed/open state of the popup is getting misset
[11:31:17] <johnbender> :(
[11:31:33] <johnbender> I can't follow the internals of the thing because gabriel didn't take out the popup manager stuff
[11:31:52] <johnbender> I'm also haveing absolutely no luck with wp7
[11:34:16] <Wilto> Ugh, ugh, ugh.
[11:34:47] <johnbender> well
[11:34:49] <johnbender> that's not true
[11:35:06] <johnbender> there's something that is reseting the scroll position when we navigate between pages
[11:35:13] <johnbender> some action in the browser
[11:43:13] <Wilto> Have you tried hitting the Windows Phone with a hammer?
[11:43:18] <Wilto> Because I AM GETTING THERE.
[12:09:09] <johnbender> I mean we can always restore the scroll position that's trivial
[12:09:16] <johnbender> that's what we do in Nav
[12:09:39] <johnbender> that that's pretty shitty
[12:09:46] <johnbender> as far as experience in concerened
[12:18:20] <Wilto> As in, it would do the Windows Phone Jump (worst dance ever), and then we’d put the user back where they were supposed to be in the first place?
[12:19:18] <Wilto> That feels like it would be the dubstep of scrolling experiences.
[12:31:53] <johnbender> yah
[12:45:46] <Wilto> Thumbs down.
[12:58:14] <johnbender> Wilto: the thing that I can't get over is that we don't have this problem when changing between pages that are retained in the DOM
[12:58:27] <Wilto> That’s a good point.
[12:58:41] <johnbender> Wilto: and that by changing pages it "fixes" the issue for the first popup
[12:58:56] <johnbender> something in the changing of pages clears the scroll caching
[13:00:36] <Wilto> Huh.
[13:01:03] <Wilto> Wonder if it’s just the act of scrolling to 0.
[13:09:21] <johnbender> Wilto: I've pulled out all the internal scrolling and it still does it
[13:09:33] <johnbender> I even tried scrolling to the current position before the hash is changed
[13:09:39] <johnbender> to see if it would "fix it"
[13:09:44] <johnbender> I'll monkey a bit more
[13:09:54] <johnbender> though my daughter isn't doing so hot today so I may be in and out
[13:24:38] <Wilto> Cool, cool.
[13:29:59] <toddparker> hey all
[13:30:02] <toddparker> out of my meeting
[13:43:24] <johnbender> toddparker: want to chat quickly?
[13:43:27] <johnbender> toddparker: skype?
[13:43:38] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: you might want to join too if you can
[13:49:55] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto you guys around?
[13:51:27] <Wilto> I am.
[13:51:42] <johnbender> Wilto: my daughter is hopefully down for a nap
[13:51:43] <johnbender> so I can chat
[13:54:49] <Wilto> Todd is in and out of meetings; might be better if we catch up tomorrow.
[13:55:13] <johnbender> Wilto: ok, I'm going to futz with  the scrolling thing a bit more but that's it for me
[13:55:26] <Wilto> Godspeed, sir.
[14:05:13] <gseguin> joining
[14:05:38] <gseguin> joining what where johnbender ?
[14:06:26] <gseguin> oh ok, cancelled
[14:07:09] <gseguin> one thing you want to check johnbender is fixed headers in iOS if you scroll programmatically
[14:11:02] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't think we're going to scroll programatically
[14:11:13] <johnbender> I think we're going to opt 7 out of back button support
[14:11:15] <johnbender> :/
[14:11:22] <gseguin> just making sure
[14:11:26] <gseguin> ok
[14:11:28] <johnbender> gseguin: appreciated
[14:11:36] <johnbender> gseguin: well we'll have to chat about it tomorrow
[14:11:46] <gseguin> alright
[14:22:15] <Wilto> Womp womp.
[14:22:20] <toddparker> hey johnbender - catching up
[14:22:28] <toddparker> i'm around now
[14:22:36] <toddparker> if you'd rather chat now
[14:24:09] <Wilto> Also happy to.
[14:28:15] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: yah now's fine
[14:28:22] <johnbender> though my daugher is prowling so you'll ahve to deal
[14:28:26] <johnbender> hopping on skype
[14:29:25] <Wilto> I’m mat.marquis on thurr.
[14:29:55] <Wilto> johnbender: ^
[14:30:52] <gseguin> fine for me too
[14:44:54] <toddparker> just huddled with johnbender and two decisions:
[14:45:33] <toddparker> 1. we need to keep digging on this WP thing. We may still need to opt them out, but we need more time on that. Part of this will require re-working parts of the popup history stuff to simplify.
[14:45:47] <toddparker> 2. Because these are bigger changes, we should do a beta
[14:48:25] <toddparker> tweeted that.
[15:07:49] <gseguin> gnarf: you around?
[15:17:11] <gnarf> gseguin: for a bit
[15:17:27] <gseguin> what's the status on that node.js server?
[15:17:32] <gseguin> can I help?
[15:19:08] <gseguin> gnarf: ^
[15:20:08] <gnarf> gseguin: I should be able to stage it this week
[15:20:48] <gnarf> fri at the lastest
[15:21:10] <gseguin> gnarf: awesome, let me know if I can help with anything
[15:21:32] <gseguin> gnarf: I'm generally on jQM Wed and Thur
