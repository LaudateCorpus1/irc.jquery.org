[06:41:14] <agcolom> Hi! Any of you around?
[06:41:54] <JasonDScott> Hi agcolom
[06:44:48] <toddmparker_> Good morning!
[06:45:11] <toddmparker_> irccloud has been wonky, seems to be back up today
[06:45:33] <agcolom> Hi :-)
[06:46:56] <agcolom> toddmparker_: it's going to be tricky at the table as most people know mainly UI... So not sure how we're going to get those more tricky events/features/widgets documented in the next 2 days...
[06:48:10] <agcolom> But i'll do my best ;-)
[07:06:51] <toddmparker_> Hi agcolom
[07:07:04] <toddmparker_> So most people are UI devs?
[07:07:46] <toddmparker_> That may be ok. Documenting the code should be the same no matter what. May be ok if they need to get up to speed as they go.
[07:08:02] <toddmparker_> Any folks at the docs table up to speed on mobile?
[07:08:50] <agcolom> not sure... We've got the talks right now, so I'll find out when that's finished...
[07:10:19] <toddmparker_> ok, first step is to see who wants to work on mobile vs. UI docs then we get 'em up to speed
[07:10:35] <agcolom> sounds like a good plan
[07:11:33] <toddmparker_> I'd like to introduce kpepin - he's a dev interested in helping with unit tests for mobile. I think gseguin and johnbender might be great people to get him up to speed and focused on where he can lend a hand
[07:12:31] <toddmparker_> if we have gaping holes in coverage on a widget, he could dig in there. Alternatively, he could work with triage/issue team on fixes and helping people write new tests for fixes.
[07:13:02] <gseguin> hi kpepin
[07:13:02] <bot-t> (56 hours 40 mins ago) <johnbender> tell gseguin the infrastructure team is using Vagrant to make setup at the summit easier. I'd like to get you setup to use it so that if it makes sense, people who want to work on jqm could also use it
[07:13:57] <gseguin> ?tell johnbender sure! ping me when you're up
[07:13:58] <bot-t> gseguin, Okay.
[07:14:07] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: I think we should be pretty hardcore on making sure we have tests in place for fixes and PRs so kpepin could be a great roving resource for tests. Not everyone knows how to do that
[07:15:59] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #96: STILL FAILING in 23 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/96/
[07:19:13] <Wilto> Goooood morning jQuery Mobile.
[07:19:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yeah sound good
[07:22:33] <toddmparker_> nice.
[07:22:38] <AlexSchmitz> Hi I'm at the summit at the bugs table
[07:22:49] <toddmparker_> Can't wait to meet you and _|Nix|_ tomorrow in person for the first time
[07:23:02] <toddmparker_> Hi AlexSchmitz
[07:23:22] <toddmparker_> what's your background?
[07:23:32] <toddmparker_> nice to get to know people
[07:25:13] <AlexSchmitz> I work with car dealerships websites mostly also have written a bunch of plugins and helped people out a lot in the jqm forum.
[07:25:50] <JonahSchulte> I'm at the bug triage table but will likely move back to bugs table at some point. I have about 12 years of experience with various web dev related technologies and have been working with jQuery for years and more recently jQuery Mobile
[07:26:12] <JonahSchulte> I do a lot of bug fixing in general so hoping to apply those skills to jQuery/jQM
[07:40:15] <dcarrith> Hi - I'm at the UI Triage table 7.
[07:40:28] <dcarrith> My Galaxy Nexus has CM10 JB 4.1.2 if ya'll need me to test anything.
[07:40:41] <dcarrith> I also have a Playbook with OS 2 dot something - needs to be charged though.
[07:42:29] <JasonDScott> I have a BB playbook, BB 9900 and a BlackBerry 10 @ table 14
[07:47:07] <toddmparker_> JonahSchulte: we're probably going to have triage/bugs be pretty seamless
[07:47:29] <JonahSchulte> sounds good
[07:47:47] <toddmparker_> I just want a group of people to help us fix bugs and write tests for the bugs
[07:48:10] <toddmparker_> and help in the tracker looking for dupes, old issues, kicking back issues without detailed info or test pages
[07:48:34] <toddmparker_> so wherever in that spectrum you want to crank is good by us
[07:48:53] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi has tagged a bunch of issues for the summit that he'd like to concentrate on
[07:53:30] <AlexSchmitz> i already looked into a couple of the high priority ones this morning before we started #4113 is a mobile safari bug have a fiddle demonstrating and #4337 works fine in a simple test case
[07:53:44] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=Dev+summit&milestone=&page=1&state=open
[07:53:54] <toddmparker_> ^^ those are some bugs for the team to look at
[07:54:09] <toddmparker_> AlexSchmitz: thanks for jumping in!
[07:54:44] <AlexSchmitz> http://jsfiddle.net/arschmitz/rSGPA/16/show for #4113
[07:54:54] <JonahSchulte> I've got my sites set on #3912
[07:55:29] <toddmparker_> I think the best way to coordinate is for folks to comment on an issues they want or are actively looking at
[07:56:00] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: great. mind commenting on the issue with the link to that and you assessment? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4113
[07:56:21] <AlexSchmitz> sure ill do the same for #4337
[07:56:35] <JonahSchulte> I'll comment on irc://chat.freenode.net:7000/#3912 that I'm currently investigating/testing
[07:56:48] <JonahSchulte> hm, weird paste there :)
[07:56:54] <JonahSchulte> bug 3912
[07:57:00] <toddmparker_> Cool. Use the heck out of comments to track what's happening as we go
[07:57:17] <toddmparker_> yeah, you need to paste in the full url I think
[07:57:26] <JonahSchulte> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3912
[07:57:27] <JonahSchulte> bam
[07:57:42] <toddmparker_> awesome
[07:57:55] <toddmparker_> If you can track that one down, I'll but you a pony
[07:58:20] <toddmparker_> BTW - Wilto (Mat Marquis) and scottjehl__ have a bunch of Android devices for testing
[07:58:37] <scottjehl__> yep - we do
[07:58:46] <Wilto> toddmparker_: We’re gonna Facetime you in, if you’re cool with that.
[07:58:50] <toddmparker_> we have a 2.2, 2.3, 4.0, 4.1 and some variants (Kindle Fire and HD, etc.)
[07:58:56] <toddmparker_> sure. now?
[07:59:12] <Wilto> And an encyclopedic knowledge of the bugs contained therein.
[07:59:26] <Wilto> Yessir; ready when you are.
[07:59:47] <JonahSchulte> There is some kind of fancy vid conf. setup here. Too bad we likely can't make use of that
[07:59:53] <toddmparker_> ok
[08:00:03] <toddmparker_> facetime ftw
[08:00:33] <gseguin> toddmparker_: trying to facetime you
[08:00:40] <gseguin> but can't figure it out
[08:00:44] <scottjehl__> try filamentgroup
[08:15:19] <toddmparker_> feels like I'm there

[08:26:52] <toddmparker_> very cool - http://gregfranko.com/jquery.tocify.js?Description
[08:31:21] <toddmparker_> gregfranko: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/index.html
[08:32:06] <toddmparker_> Example/tutorial like this could be cool for backbone
[08:32:06] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html
[08:32:26] <toddmparker_> best practices, basic setup, code walkthrough and demo
[08:39:48] <JonahSchulte> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3912
[08:45:24] <Wilto> TABLE 14: ALL HANDS REPORT IN.
[08:46:03] <JonahSchulte> HELLO
[08:46:54] <WaterlooErik___> !
[08:48:14] <gregfranko> toddmparker: Should I include a Require.js example as well?
[08:58:14] <AlexSchmitz> Here!
[09:04:21] <johnbender> alright
[09:04:21] <bot-t> (1 hour 50 mins ago) <gseguin> tell johnbender sure! ping me when you're up
[09:04:36] <johnbender> time to fix the build :/
[09:04:37] <gseguin> hey Bender!
[09:04:44] <johnbender> terrible time for it to be broken in retrospect
[09:04:45] <johnbender> sorry all
[09:04:54] <gseguin> no worries
[09:04:54] <johnbender> it was late on Friday and I was tired from merge conflicts :(
[09:05:07] <gseguin> need help with that?
[09:05:22] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll take care of it
[09:05:38] <johnbender> gseguin: it's a result of my changes so I'm the best person to fix it
[09:05:41] <gseguin> what about the Vagrant thing that you wanted to school me on?
[09:05:47] <johnbender> gseguin: ah!
[09:05:50] <johnbender> gseguin: real simple
[09:06:01] <johnbender> gseguin: I've got a vagrant branch on my repo
[09:06:05] <johnbender> you can just add it as a remote
[09:06:07] <johnbender> pull the branch
[09:06:09] <johnbender> switch to the branch
[09:06:10] <gseguin> k
[09:06:12] <johnbender> `vagrant up`
[09:06:17] <johnbender> checkout your working branch
[09:06:21] <gseguin> and ?BOOM
[09:06:21] <johnbender> hack hack
[09:06:26] <johnbender> `vagrant suspend`
[09:06:28] <johnbender> err
[09:06:34] <johnbender> checkout the vagrant branch
[09:06:36] <johnbender> `vagrant suspen`
[09:06:39] <johnbender> when you're done
[09:06:40] <johnbender> super easy
[09:06:57] <johnbender> gseguin: let me know if you have any issues
[09:07:00] <johnbender> it should "just work"
[09:07:00] * gseguin goes to do just that
[09:07:16] <johnbender> gseguin: that may, or may not, be easier than dealing with people setting up apache
[09:07:20] <johnbender> I'll leave that to you guys
[09:07:36] <gseguin> we got all macs here
[09:07:45] <gseguin> to it just works
[09:07:49] <johnbender> ah
[09:07:51] <johnbender> nevermind then :)
[09:07:52] <gseguin> s/to/so/
[09:16:14] <toddmparker_> gregfranko: sure, a require example could be cool too
[09:17:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: are you floating around?
[09:20:04] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #98: STILL FAILING in 23 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/98/
[09:32:11] <toddmparker_> start of sample data for the RWD table - http://jsbin.com/eqevuk/2/edit
[09:36:43] <scottjehl__> Todd: css from our table http://filamentgroup.com/examples/rwd-table-patterns/_css/rwd-table.css
[09:46:58] <scottjehl__> hey looks like we've got a nav regression
[09:47:37] <scottjehl__> asset paths within content are borked when pages are fetched via nav model.
[09:47:47] <scottjehl__> fine after refreshing the page
[09:48:33] <scottjehl__> lunch time
[09:48:53] <johnbender> scottjehl__: that's probably from my basetag alterations
[09:48:58] <johnbender> there was conflict with _|Nix|_'s changes
[09:49:00] <johnbender> :/
[09:49:09] <scottjehl__> ruh roh
[09:49:12] <scottjehl__> tricky beast
[09:49:21] <johnbender> might have to revert
[09:49:22] <scottjehl__> I thought we had a test against that
[09:49:23] <scottjehl__> odd
[09:49:27] <johnbender> scottjehl__: so did I
[09:49:31] <scottjehl__> we probably can test that
[09:49:45] <johnbender> scottjehl__: I'm sure we do somewhere just need to figure out why that's sneaking by
[09:49:52] <scottjehl__> if nothing else, just an onerror handler on an image within the page that we know should load properly
[09:50:07] <scottjehl__> ^ I don't think we have this test in there. Worth writing
[09:50:09] <toddmparker_> johnbender: mind taking a look at this one? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5172
[09:50:10] <johnbender> scottjehl__: I'm burried trying to fix these other tests, want to take a look?
[09:50:14] <scottjehl__> I can write it if we want
[09:50:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: trying to get the sequence tests passing
[09:50:34] <toddmparker_> johnbender: that is the issue scottjehl__ mentioned above
[09:50:40] <toddmparker_> ok
[09:50:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll gladly take a look afterward but it sounds like it's causing issues
[10:03:01] <scottjehl__> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5173
[10:06:11] <johnbender> scottjehl__: toddmparker_: is that issue preventing people from doing work
[10:06:21] <johnbender> I can always just revert it and go back to fixing it in my branch
[10:16:05] <Wilto> What’s the good word in here?
[10:18:56] <JonahSchulte> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3912 is a fun one
[10:19:32] <Wilto> JonahSchulte: I’ve looked into this one before.
[10:19:43] <Wilto> It is, by my estimation, an Unfixable™.
[10:20:05] <JonahSchulte> It seems like what's happening is that the fixed header doesn't technically slide back in when you click in the main content area to remove selection from the select list
[10:20:21] <JonahSchulte> it reappears but z-index doesn't get set properly somehow
[10:20:48] <JonahSchulte> Which seems mildly impossible
[10:25:53] <Wilto> Oh, it’s worse than that.
[10:25:59] <Wilto> It’s unaffected by z-index.
[10:26:18] <Wilto> One of those deep-down rendering/focus Android issues.
[10:27:06] <johnbender> scottjehl__: toddmparker_: I'm going to revert both of my merges and deal with these issues in the branches themselves
[10:27:10] <johnbender> any objections?
[10:27:50] <toddmparker_> johnbender: that sounds good to me
[10:29:21] <JonahSchulte> Wilto: Yeah, trying to see if there's a way to reset it but am wondering if I should refocus my efforts on another task :)
[10:29:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: scottjehl__: JasonDScott_: _|Nix|_: agcolom: uGoMobi: if you guys can hold off on pushing any new commits for a few minutes it will make my life easier I think
[10:29:42] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok cool
[10:30:31] <johnbender> lucky for me
[10:30:43] <johnbender> I rebased before merging so reverting all the commits is trivial
[10:31:34] <scottjehl__> k I'll write a unit test now for this
[10:31:54] <scottjehl__> johnbender: noted on the "don't commit" part :)
[10:32:04] <johnbender> scottjehl__: perfect
[10:32:14] <johnbender> that way I can rebase again and get that test
[10:33:42] <johnbender> scottjehl__: I would build the test on the current broken version so that you can verify your test works :P
[10:33:47] <Wilto> johnbender: Sure thing.
[10:33:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: scottjehl__ reverted
[10:34:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/oGOmog
[10:34:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] revert base tag merge and query param hash merge - John Bender
[10:34:10] <toddmparker_> thanks
[10:34:29] <johnbender> I really really love fastforward merges
[10:34:42] <johnbender> I just checked out the series of commits into the working branch as a revert commit
[10:34:45] <johnbender> so trivial
[10:35:08] <Wilto> Alright toddmparker_ , I think we’ve largely got everyone situated over here.
[10:37:39] <johnbender> scottjehl__: once you do a pull of the latest from master the basetag issue should go away
[10:37:43] <johnbender> at your discretion
[10:43:04] <uGoMobi> I am going to work on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4250 now
[10:51:59] <toddmparker_> good luck uGoMobi!
[10:52:20] <toddmparker_> scottjehl__: here is a classic example of MQ issues with screen vs. element width
[10:52:22] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/eqevuk/7/edit
[10:52:50] <toddmparker_> click the "columns button"
[10:53:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: thanks, I'll need it

[11:29:24] <scottjehl__> looks like we've got a nav test or two failing in FF... maybe?
[11:30:07] <johnbender> scottjehl__: possibly?
[11:32:41] <johnbender> scottjehl__: one fixed lol

[11:34:35] <scottjehl__> thanks!
[11:34:44] <johnbender> scottjehl__: moving on to the others
[11:35:02] <scottjehl__> cool
[11:37:21] <johnbender> scottjehl__: I'm relatively sure I've addressed nearly all of these issues in my testswarm branch :(
[11:37:24] <johnbender> let me go look
[11:37:28] <johnbender> to see what I can pull in there
[11:44:30] <scottjehl__> it's a phonegap test
[11:44:34] <scottjehl__> number 16
[11:44:39] <scottjehl__> still failing apparently
[11:46:16] <johnbender> scottjehl__: that's the one I addressed with my push
[11:46:19] <johnbender> is it still failing?
[11:48:40] <scottjehl__> i'm told anyway. I don't have it pulled down currently
[11:50:10] <gseguin> what'd I miss?
[11:51:29] <kpepin> Scott:  Test 16 in FFF looks like it is passing now, thanks.  Hand to clear out history to see it pass.
[11:51:36] <kpepin> FFF = FF
[11:53:01] <kpepin> thanks for fixing the phonegap thing.
[11:53:58] <scottjehl__> NICE.
[11:53:59] <scottjehl__> thanks Bender
[11:54:13] <johnbender> kpepin: scottjehl__: it was an especially lame test failure
[11:54:16] <johnbender> sorry
[11:54:52] <johnbender> scottjehl__: not sure if you're still using that nexus 7 you got at google io but I just bought one
[11:54:58] <johnbender> (for pdf reading)
[11:55:41] <toddmparker_> working on the RWD table API and markup example. Current form: http://jsbin.com/eqevuk/16/edit

[11:56:11] <scottjehl__> it's great
[11:56:22] <johnbender> scottjehl__: yah I'm pretty impressed
[11:56:28] <johnbender> I wish they had more "tablet" apps
[11:56:30] <johnbender> twitter in particular
[11:56:35] <johnbender> but otherwise it's really good
[11:56:43] <johnbender> scottjehl__: honestly, the biggest surprise is Adobe Reader
[11:56:48] <johnbender> works great :P
[11:58:12] <JasonDScott_> toddmparker_:  Were you thinking something like this for the sliding panels? <div data-role="overflow" data-position="right" data-behavior="over" ></div>
[11:58:13] <johnbender> lightweight, snappy, full featured, and easy to use
[11:59:44] <uGoMobi> AlexSchmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4999
[12:00:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: uGoMobi: scottjehl__: it might be a good idea to tell people to run the test suites using chrome since we don't do x-platform automated tests very well :(
[12:00:29] <johnbender> and to avoid confusion
[12:00:32] <johnbender> (during setup)
[12:00:51] <gseguin> k
[12:00:52] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok
[12:03:09] <johnbender> once I get the kinks worked out with my first pass at query params to hash values
[12:03:18] <johnbender> I'll merge the fixes in the testswarm branch
[12:03:30] <johnbender> that'll make a dent there
[12:03:59] <JonahSchulte> I'll take https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5166 unless someone else is already working on it

[12:25:20] <johnbender> kpepin: within two days of getting back from the hospital it was extremely clear that there are two groups of superhumans living among us on the planet
[12:25:29] <johnbender> kpepin: parents with twins, and single parents
[12:25:37] <johnbender> my hat is off to you sir
[12:26:02] <johnbender> kpepin: and I say that as a parent of an extremely well mannered and sleepy child :)

[12:28:29] <johnbender> scottjehl__: maybe that's why we don't have one?
[12:28:32] <johnbender> :( :(
[12:28:49] <johnbender> scottjehl__: also I like how you presented your care-mad statement :)
[12:31:00] <ryanneufeld> who's here from JQM?
[12:31:08] <ryanneufeld> I have a BB Playbook for you guys
[12:31:21] <ryanneufeld> it's collected dust since SF, so yeah...
[12:31:24] <ryanneufeld> it's yours if you want it
[12:33:12] <scottjehl__> ok johnbender here's the deal
[12:33:44] <scottjehl__> We used to have an event that I could tie into and get the ajax response text before it's made into dom things
[12:35:53] <scottjehl__> hmm I guess you can still do that with pagechange.... maybe
[12:43:53] <scottjehl__> okay so this is going to be a not great unit test from a code cleanliness perspective
[12:49:57] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott_: yes, that seems good
[12:50:02] <toddmparker_> for config on panels

[13:46:49] <toddmparker_> I'll post this to the issue and if you edit it, just comment with the new version link
[13:53:10] <scottjehl__> johnbender: I pushed a branch with that test... it's passing but it shouldn't be.
[13:53:11] <scottjehl__> doh
[13:53:25] <johnbender> scottjehl__: :(
[13:55:45] <scottjehl__> it looks like something may have changed in that thing you reverted where the markup is injected into DOM before the base tag is updated
[13:55:53] <scottjehl__> which makes the image load from the wrong path
[13:58:16] <johnbender> scottjehl__: so I'm confused, it's passing because you have the revert commit?

[14:00:14] <scottjehl__> nah it was passing because I'm a bad test writer I guess
[14:00:49] <Wilto> Or you’re just that good.
[14:00:53] <frequent> @toddmparker: thanks for the update on 5093 rwd-tables.

[14:06:47] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_: demo at docs/content/content-overflow.html
[14:08:31] <toddmparker_> what's the full path for that JasonDScott
[14:09:08] <toddmparker_> frequent: our tables are going to be the bare minimum for the first round, but I hope you think this is a good foundation
[14:09:28] <toddmparker_> how goes Wilto
[14:09:36] <frequent> yeah I saw that.
[14:09:58] <toddmparker_> we'll get to all the coolness later
[14:09:58] <Wilto> toddmparker_: Good. Was just helping out the docs crew on some stuff.
[14:10:11] <frequent> :-)
[14:10:42] <JonahSchulte> Is anyone working on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3208 ?
[14:10:54] <frequent> currently trying tabs with tables. If it works, it really looks sophisticated
[14:11:14] <toddmparker_> Wilto: great
[14:11:17] <Wilto> toddmparker_: Meantime, I pushed up a branch with a parent class that breaks grid elements to full-width non-floated below ~600px.
[14:12:08] <Wilto> Still dunno how I’m feeling about it, but it exists now. Doesn’t look like http://jquerymobile.com/branches/ has updated yet.

[14:26:03] <toddmparker_> i'd like to huddle with Wilto, scottjehl__ , JasonDScott to look at our panels and figure out a plan

[14:28:00] <Wilto> I took out a big chunk of nav today. Just felt like there was a lotta code in there, y’know?
[14:28:01] <toddmparker_> think the RWD table stuff is really lean and mean so it shouldn't be a quagmire
[14:28:16] <johnbender> Wilto: more power to you lol
[14:28:20] <Wilto> It’s like, we can’t possibly need all this! Deleted.

[14:38:56] <toddmparker_> ah, was wondering why you so ruldely hung up on me
[14:39:01] <toddmparker_> kidding
[14:39:20] <toddmparker_> auto-close i think. like a menu would
[14:39:31] <toddmparker_> that ipad was on battery all day? impressive
[14:39:41] <uGoMobi> I wait with cherry-picking my fix for the 1px jitter into the 1.1 and 1.2 stable branches so we can do more testing first
[14:40:23] <JasonDScott_> toddmparker_:  ok. The iPad was plugged into a computer but i think FaceTime was taking more battery than the usb was providing :|
[14:41:14] <toddmparker_> gotcha. makes sense
