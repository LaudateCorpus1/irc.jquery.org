[08:27:36] <toddmparker> hi agcolom - how was vacation?
[08:28:05] <agcolom> it was relaxing! 
[08:28:14] <toddmparker> nice. jealous.
[08:28:18] <agcolom> but the weather was not good :(
[08:28:19] <toddmparker> you sounds refreshed
[08:28:25] <toddmparker> no? that's too bad.
[08:28:45] <agcolom> totally! I was sleeping 10to11h a day for the 1st week! 
[08:29:48] <agcolom> so managed to do some seriously battery recharging!

[10:43:25] <nschonni1> The url http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/ on http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/03/22/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-2-1/ is returning a 404
[10:46:19] <toddmparker> gseguin: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/
[10:46:29] <toddmparker> thanks nschonni 
[10:56:21] <nschonni> np
[10:58:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[10:59:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you think? Shall we merge enhancement-order?
[11:24:09] <gnarf> i'm blowing up your view. for a second and letting it rebuild
[11:24:14] <gnarf> don't panic
[11:26:35] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: toddmparker: _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: agcolom: gnarf: STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING: http://starlogs.net/#jquery/jquery-mobile
[11:26:53] <gnarf> johnbender: :)
[11:27:05] <johnbender> gnarf: I assume I'm late to the game?
[11:27:29] <johnbender> also when is this going to get dmca'd ?
[11:29:22] <gnarf> heh
[11:29:36] <gnarf> yeah, that was earlier last week that i started seeing starlogs
[11:30:49] <nschonni> looks like the url is fixed now, thanks toddmparker
[11:51:39] <_|Nix|_> "Quality: Linting"
[11:53:04] <_|Nix|_> So, where's the rest? Pan down to imperial cruiser, etc ...
[11:59:10] <uGoMobi> awesome
[11:59:55] <uGoMobi> don't need blog posts for release anymore ;)
[12:06:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Pong!
[12:06:51] <gnarf> nschonni: you're welcome ;)
[12:12:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! So, what do you think? Shall I merge enhancement-order?
[12:18:52] <agcolom> johnbender: Excellent! (except that I had the volume set to max as had been watching a video by Luke W prior to that)
[12:19:15] <johnbender> agcolom: o.o
[12:19:43] <agcolom> I am at home so all ok... would have been funny if I had been in a meeting ;-)
[12:20:30] <gseguin> johnbender: heh :)
[12:21:19] <gseguin> toddmparker: I can fix view for 1.2.1
[12:21:43] <toddmparker> gseguin: great. thinking 1.1.2 might also have the same issue?
[12:22:46] <gseguin> yeah, ideally we should have a custom script that downloads the zip from the tagged version instead of checking out and building
[12:23:17] <gseguin> I spoke with gnarf about the current script and he gave me some pointers
[12:23:23] <gseguin> it's on my list
[12:23:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for sure 
[12:23:59] <arschmitz> i think it looks good and it passes the test no reason to wait
[12:24:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool! Will do!
[12:24:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nice
[12:24:46] <gnarf> gseguin: it's fixed?
[12:24:53] <gnarf> gseguin: i had a bug, fixed it
[12:25:10] <gseguin> gnarf: yeah the removal of index is fixed
[12:26:08] <gseguin> gnarf: but the build script used for view does not work for jqm
[12:26:28] <gseguin> because you land on the dev version
[12:26:38] <gnarf> sure - tweak it a bit
[12:26:49] <gnarf> but it should be a checkout of the dev version on that tag yeah
[12:27:48] <gseguin> gnarf: maybe a specific grunt target?
[12:29:14] <gnarf> gseguin: perhaps, i mean, whatever you need to do to make a build script that works for EVERY version of mobile
[12:29:17] <gnarf> past, present, and future
[12:29:22] <gnarf> and you can't change the tag in the past
[12:29:23] <gnarf> have fun
[12:29:24] <gnarf> ;)
[12:29:48] <gseguin> yeah sounds super fun! Yay! :P
[12:30:12] <gnarf> gseguin: personally
[12:30:28] <gnarf> i think we just let the old tags be lame on view
[12:30:28] <gnarf> who really needs em
[12:31:07] <gnarf> view is really just there to serve the content from github with the proper mime types and subomodules for easy testing
[12:33:03] <gseguin> agreed
[12:33:24] <gseguin> toddmparker: "fixed" it: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1
[12:33:55] <toddmparker> heh. better than a 404
[12:34:00] <toddmparker> thanks
[12:34:10] <toddmparker> sad day here in Boston
[12:34:20] <gseguin> what happened?
[12:34:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i was just reading about that
[12:34:59] <gseguin> oh crap!
[12:36:09] <_|Nix|_> Holy cow!
[12:41:05] <gseguin> toddmparker: man! hope all of you guys and your close ones are ok
[12:47:16] <_|Nix|_> Agreed! Wow! ... that's terrible!
