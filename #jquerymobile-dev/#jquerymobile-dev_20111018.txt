[09:27:01] <kinblas> toddparker: ping
[09:27:22] <kinblas> toddparker: is there an issue for the disappearing footer you mentioned in email?
[09:40:24] <toddparker> i think there's a bunch
[09:41:43] <toddparker> there are just so many issues tagged to footer

[09:45:25] <kinblas> toddparker: so have you seen it first hand (lastnight) or just going off of the old bugs? I checked in a fix recently that allows folks to simply fire off a contentmodified event and the footers/headers will update appropriately
[09:46:22] <toddparker> looking
[09:47:03] <toddparker> we should document that stuff not eh fixed header page
[09:47:09] <toddparker> i added some stuff there yesterday

[09:47:48] <toddparker> few more issues

[09:48:03] <toddparker> i was seeing it be really buggy last night when testing
[09:48:10] <toddparker> the persistent page demos are junk
[09:48:34] <toddparker> the biggest issues is the toolbars disappear on list views and there's not easy way to get them back b/c the page is all linked
[09:48:42] <toddparker> not a code issue, but a usability issue
[09:48:53] <toddparker> tho the fact that they disappear is a problem

[09:49:39] <johnbender> posting for self review?
[09:49:39] <Wilto> oh the shame
[09:49:44] <johnbender> lol
[09:49:50] <toddparker> johnbender: mat got grouped selects to look good
[09:49:52] <Wilto> Posting because of git chaos.
[09:49:58] <toddparker> they were sort of broken
[09:49:58] <johnbender> you've got the keys!
[09:50:04] <Wilto> I wanted to keep that mess quarantined, is all.
[09:50:23] <Wilto> If you take a look at the issue page for that, you’ll see the “fixes” commit has happened six (6) times already.
[09:50:44] <johnbender> Wilto: one quick note
[09:51:09] <johnbender> we try and separate out changes to different aspects of the code base into different commits
[09:51:16] <johnbender> so css, js, whitespace, docs
[09:51:21] <johnbender> just a rule of thumbe
[09:51:23] <johnbender> -e
[09:51:49] <johnbender> the smaller the commit the easier it is to bisect and reason about
[09:51:52] <toddparker> kinblas: I guess the best approach is for you scan through ally eh issues for fixed toolbars and decide which ones are fixable
[09:51:52] <johnbender> less to wade through
[09:51:59] <Wilto> Ahh, makes sense.
[09:52:05] <toddparker> I don't think anyone has opened that can of worms for a long time
[09:52:08] * kinblas sighs
[09:52:12] <kinblas> none of these have samples
[09:52:13] <toddparker> i know, i know
[09:52:17] <toddparker> don't get too bogged down
[09:52:28] <kinblas> toddparker: ok I'll see what I can do
[09:52:32] <toddparker> just look for issues that seem straightforward and fixable
[09:52:44] <toddparker> you must have closed some fixed bar issues recently, right?
[09:52:54] * kinblas puts on his headers and footers
[09:52:55] <toddparker> there were ones with search filters and collapsibles breaking it
[09:53:09] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah I fixed those
[09:53:21] <kinblas> basically those widgets now fire a contentmodified event
[09:53:26] <kinblas> which the headers/footers listen for
[09:53:27] <johnbender> kinblas: you can do it man
[09:53:31] <johnbender> it's a tall ugly hill to climb
[09:53:36] <johnbender> but if anyone can do it, you can
[09:53:43] <toddparker> go go go
[09:53:49] <kinblas> sounds like a thomas the train quote
[09:53:56] * johnbender slinks off to find an easy issue to fix
[09:54:00] <kinblas> lol
[09:54:03] <toddparker> i think i can, i think i can
[09:54:11] <toddparker> test this page: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/footer-persist-a.html
[09:54:15] <kinblas> toddparker: wrong train ... you need more kids
[09:54:26] <toddparker> and flip between the other links in the footer
[09:54:53] <kinblas> toddparker: you see problems on ipad and iphone?
[09:55:14] <toddparker> yeah
[09:55:24] <toddparker> phone, ios5
[09:55:50] <kinblas> hmmm ok, I only have 4.x devices at the moment, I'll see if I can repro
[09:55:55] <toddparker> i think a bunch of these issues can be closed too
[09:56:07] <toddparker> you can :)
[09:56:38] <kinblas> toddparker: so what's the latest plan? Ship today? Tomorrow?
[09:57:06] <toddparker> i need to ping john again
[09:57:10] <toddparker> tomorrow at the earliest
[09:57:18] <toddparker> so we can keep fixing today
[09:57:25] <kinblas> ok, sounds good

[10:42:20] <eddiemonge> oh. my bad
[10:42:24] <johnbender> eddiemonge: not your fault
[10:42:42] <eddiemonge> even though i changed basically the whole thing?
[10:42:45] <johnbender> I should really pull the ci stuff out into a new clean branch based off of master to avoid that stuff
[10:43:08] <johnbender> eddiemonge: we're here to change stuff!
[10:43:12] <johnbender> that's our jobs
[10:43:19] <johnbender> terrible sentence
[10:43:24] <johnbender> that's our job

[12:25:26] <kinblas> johnbender: yo
[12:31:37] <johnbender> kinblas: hey
[12:31:42] <johnbender> question for you
[12:33:27] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2330#issuecomment-2446236
[12:33:27] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2330 on jquery-mobile, reported by adrianoldham (1m, 3w ago): Disabled checkbox and radio elements ignore scroll event
[12:36:44] <kinblas> johnbender: I didn't specifically add that line of code in question ... I have to step through the history ... past the style changes :-P ... to figure out who added that
[12:37:50] <johnbender> kinblas: I was more curious about how that will behave?
[12:37:59] <johnbender> I phrased it poorely
[12:38:15] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah on a touch device vmousemove maps to touchmove
[12:38:25] <kinblas> and preventing default kills scrolling
[12:38:31] <kinblas> on a touchmove event
[12:38:38] <kinblas> so we need to figure who added it and why?
[12:38:59] <kinblas> unfortunately blame attributes it to rwaldrn ... but I'm trying to find the checkin before his
[12:39:51] <johnbender> kinblas: git blame js/jquery.mobile.forms.checkboxradio.js | grep -A2 vmouseover
[12:39:55] <johnbender> arg
[12:41:17] <johnbender> kinblas: git log | grep -A20 `git blame js/jquery.mobile.forms.checkboxradio.js | grep -A2 vmouseover | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'`
[12:42:56] <kinblas> johnbender: so it looks like scott added it but I'm not sure why he would want to preventDefault on a mouseover ... that really doesn't do anything. I think what he really wanted to do was stoppropagation
[12:44:16] <johnbender> indeed
[12:44:38] <johnbender> kinblas: maybe this is a stupid question
[12:44:50] <johnbender> but why would that halt the browser's native scrolling?
[12:44:58] <johnbender> mind you I haven't tested it
[12:45:10] <johnbender> so I have no idea if what hat guys says is true
[12:46:21] <kinblas> johnbender: hang on a sec let me see what preventDefault() on touchstart does aside from killing mouse events
[12:49:58] <kinblas> johnbender: grrr .... preventDefault() on touchstart kills mouseevents *AND* scrolling
[12:50:21] <kinblas> the vmouseover and vmousedown events are triggered off of touchstart on touchdevices
[12:52:40] <kinblas> johnbender: can try something on your android device?
[12:53:21] <kinblas> johnbender: go here: http://bit.ly/epmIB4
[12:54:31] <kinblas> Go down to the "touchpad" section, and check "Log All Events", and under touchstart, check the preventDefault() checkbox
[12:54:54] <kinblas> johnbender: that should kill scrolling on your android device
[12:55:09] <kinblas> johnbender: if you swipe your finger around in the yellow box
[12:56:49] <johnbender> anywhere in the yellow box?
[12:57:21] <johnbender> kinblas: scrolls fine for me unless I'm doing something wrong
[12:58:06] <kinblas> johnbender: it still scrolls even after checking those checkboxes?
[12:58:18] <johnbender> newp one sec
[12:58:35] <johnbender> yah the whole thing is stuck
[12:58:38] <johnbender> kinblas: ^
[12:58:43] <kinblas> johnbender: btw, hint, the main headers over the checkboxes are collapsible
[12:59:07] <johnbender> I have to refresh to get them to do anything
[12:59:07] <kinblas> ok damn, so I think what scott was trying to do was prevent default so the click handler doesn't fire
[12:59:25] <kinblas> if you preventDefault on mousedown, no click is generated
[12:59:46] <kinblas> if you do the same on touchstart, no mouse events are generated, but apparently it also has the side effect of killing scrolling
[12:59:53] <johnbender> ...
[12:59:55] <kinblas> soooooo
[13:00:06] <johnbender> kinblas: that might be useful for scroll regions :D
[13:00:22] <kinblas> johnbender: so there are 2 options here
[13:01:39] <kinblas> johnbender: Oh man, nevermind I was basing what I was going to say on old crusty code
[13:01:44] <kinblas> looking at the recent code
[13:01:55] <kinblas> it is pretty safe to just remove the return false in the vmouseover callback
[13:02:08] <johnbender> that's what I was thinking
[13:02:10] <johnbender> just wanted to be sure
[13:02:46] <kinblas> johnbender: sorry, went off on a tangent because the old code had a mousedown in it
[13:02:50] <kinblas> and apparently that no longer exists
[13:02:54] <kinblas> in the HEAD
[13:03:43] <johnbender> so I'm still confused should I just remove the binding all together, I can't see why we wouldn't want the vmouseover to bubble
[13:04:00] <johnbender> with stopProp or preventDefault
[13:04:31] <johnbender> kinblas: ^
[13:05:00] <kinblas> johnbender: I think we need to look at the markup, if it's embedded in a buttonMarkup or something
[13:05:20] <kinblas> it might be trying to stop the event from reaching that so it doesn't show the hilighted color
[13:05:28] <kinblas> in anycase, if you want to be safe
[13:05:39] <kinblas> just call e.stopPropagation() and remove the return
[13:13:05] <johnbender> kinblas: that makes sense, maybe we can send an email to scott too after we push it
[13:13:08] <johnbender> just to be sure
[13:13:25] <johnbender> event propagation is very side-effecty
[13:13:59] * johnbender wants to build a js + DOM model checker so very badly
[13:27:19] <johnbender> kinblas: there's a test failure in event that I have to address and I'm heading out to run a quick errand (picking up suite for my friend's wedding)
[13:27:58] <kinblas> johnbender: failure caused by the checkbox change?
[13:29:51] <eddiemonge> johnbender: they make suites to go?
[13:36:32] <johnbender> eddiemonge: sigh s/te/t/
[13:36:53] <johnbender> kinblas: I think so
[14:05:18] <Wilto> Hey guys, just saw your email to Scott—I think he’s more-or-less off the grid for a while longer.
[14:06:16] <Wilto> Just getting caught up now, but… I can’t see where changing that to stopPropagation() could cause any issues.
[14:06:52] <Wilto> “return false” doesn’t, like… Stop cursor events or somesuch, does it? That’s the only reason I could see for having that in there.
[14:08:53] <Wilto> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/pointer-events
[14:09:36] <Wilto> Anyway, just throwin’ stuff out there.

[14:21:01] <johnbender> Wilto: yah I figure he'll check in when he can
[14:21:19] <johnbender> but I thought it better to send off the email just in case
[14:21:34] <johnbender> that return false was actually disabling scrolling for one user
[14:21:49] <Wilto> Weird.
[14:21:59] <Wilto> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/pointer-events
[14:22:21] <Wilto> Is all I could come up with, for reasoning behind it. I don’t know, though—just taking stabs.
[14:24:31] <johnbender> Wilto: http://bit.ly/epmIB4
[14:25:11] <johnbender> if you scroll down and check the preventDefault box under touchstart you won't be able to scroll the page at all
[14:25:47] <Wilto> Huh, cool.
[14:30:14] <johnbender> kinblas: so I just took a quick look to clarify my understanding of the issue with vmouseover,
[14:30:35] <kinblas> johnbender: uh huh ...
[14:30:56] <johnbender> the reason it disables touchstart is because vmouseover is triggered as a result of touchstart (which makes sense)
[14:30:57] <kinblas> right-o
[14:31:02] <johnbender> so a return false borks the touchstart
[14:31:06] <johnbender> cool
[14:31:09] <kinblas> right
[14:31:11] <johnbender> Wilto that's why the two are related
[14:32:35] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.vmouse.js#L205
[14:32:52] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.vmouse.js#L361
[14:33:16] <johnbender> `return false` === nuclear option
[14:44:12] <johnbender> kinblas: another `return false` issue :(
[14:44:18] <johnbender> or possible return false issue
[14:44:43] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.forms.checkboxradio.js#L83
[14:44:51] <johnbender> scottjehl: ^
[14:48:26] <kinblas> johnbender: that return false is necessary to prevent the synthesized click event ... is there a problem occurring? Or did you just notice it?
[14:48:46] <kinblas> johnbender: well, return false isn't necessary, but the preventDefault() is
[14:50:12] <kinblas> actually this is a label, so I'm not sure it's necessary, once again, I'm not sure if the intent to kill the click on the label is because they don't want the event to propagate upwards
[14:50:22] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm looking into it
[14:50:32] <kinblas> killing the propagation would allow them to embed checkboxes/radios, etc in things like collapsible headers
[14:50:42] <johnbender> kinblas: if I permit the click a click event is fired on the input
[14:50:45] <kinblas> or things that respond to the actual clicks like listviews
[14:51:18] <kinblas> johnbender: is that good or bad?
[14:51:19] <johnbender> I think it just needs to trigger the click explicityly
[14:51:23] <johnbender> kinblas: both :(
[14:51:36] <johnbender> good in that it solves the issue without having to manually trigger a click
[14:51:43] <johnbender> bad in that there's isn't an obvious reason why
[14:59:25] <johnbender> kinblas: the input is a sibling to the label in the enhanced markup so I'm not clear on why the click gets triggerd if that return false is removed
[15:05:59] <kinblas> johnbender: perhaps that's the behavior of tying the label to a radio/checkbox
[15:08:25] * johnbender sighs
[15:08:28] <johnbender> kinblas: so obvious
[15:09:23] <kinblas> heh, I can't tell if I was stating something obvious you knew already or if that was news?
[15:09:43] <johnbender> so obvious
[15:10:33] <johnbender> kinblas: no matter how I change it though I get test failures in checkboxradio so I need to look into those
[15:27:55] <johnbender> kinblas: you mentioned embedding as a possible reason for swalling that click
[15:28:19] <kinblas> yeah
[15:28:23] <johnbender> are we just "enhancing" how the browser normally treats those clicks?
[15:28:47] <kinblas> not sure what you mean by "enhancing"
[15:28:51] <johnbender> you can't take a normal checkbox element and embed it into something that binds on click and expect it not to propagate eh?
[15:29:17] <kinblas> right
[15:29:20] <kinblas> well
[15:29:49] <kinblas> so there are cases where folks create a UI where a clickable element has another clickable element inside it
[15:30:06] <johnbender> right
[15:30:10] <kinblas> example
[15:30:13] <kinblas> buy now
[15:30:15] <kinblas> button
[15:30:28] <kinblas> in a listview element that takes you to the "details" of that item
[15:30:38] <kinblas> or a "compare" checkbox
[15:30:55] <johnbender> I totally get the use case
[15:31:04] <johnbender> I'm only asking if we should really assume that role
[15:31:13] <kinblas> of killing the click?
[15:31:15] <johnbender> yah
[15:31:25] <johnbender> if they don't want it to propogate that's their job eh?
[15:31:30] <kinblas> of stopping the propagation? Or preventing the default?
[15:31:36] <johnbender> either really
[15:31:40] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah I agree on the propagation
[15:32:04] <johnbender> I guess it's just a matter of degrees
[15:32:15] <johnbender> which is hwy I said "enhancing"
[15:32:16] <kinblas> johnbender: the thing you might want to make sure of is that *NOT* doing a preventDefault() prevents the click handler from executing twice ... it shouldn't but we should just make sure that doesn't happen
[15:32:45] <kinblas> btw, I'm very wary of changing behavior at this point
[15:32:50] <johnbender> kinblas: oh yah
[15:32:55] <johnbender> I'm not changing it
[15:33:02] <johnbender> I know there are people out there who rely on that
[15:33:06] <johnbender> someone does
[15:33:24] <johnbender> I was just curious if you had a position on that
[15:33:34] <johnbender> since it seems like overstepping our bounds to me
[15:33:35] <kinblas> in general
[15:33:48] <kinblas> I would *NOT* assume that we can just blindly swallow events
[15:33:54] <johnbender> facts
[15:34:33] <kinblas> johnbender: but one issue I think we have is that we generate markup that acts on the behalf of the real element
[15:35:00] <kinblas> and folks don't have a way to add their event handlers to the generated markup
[15:35:12] <kinblas> that allow them to make these decisions
[15:35:43] <kinblas> hence questions like ... "should we be generating ids for our enhanced markup based on ids on the elements they are replacing"
[15:36:16] <johnbender> yah there are quite a few issues that arise from generating the makrup
[15:36:18] <johnbender> *markup
[15:50:56] <karlsberg87> Hello
[15:52:12] <karlsberg87> Why JQM use Absolute units (PX) in font-size of texts and not relatives EM or similar? How i can change all font-size when i capture each screen density (mobiles, media queries) =
[16:06:38] <johnbender> karlsberg87: you'll have to ask Todd about that
[16:06:50] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[16:06:53] <karlsberg87> Aja
[16:07:04] <karlsberg87> toddparker:  im looking to you!
[16:07:31] <karlsberg87> what is the reason for use absolutes units and not allow change all text using a parent declaration ?
[16:07:38] <karlsberg87> the dark reason*
[16:07:41] <karlsberg87> hehe
[16:08:44] <karlsberg87> ops, its away
[16:08:53] <karlsberg87> johnbender: why he?
[16:17:00] <johnbender> karlsberg87: I'm not actually sure I'll be interested to hear the answer myself
[16:17:27] <johnbender> :D
[16:29:18] <karlsberg87> johnbender: today maybe no, he are busy
[16:36:24] <kinblas> karlsberg87: it's evening where toddparker is so I'm not sure you'll get a response today
[16:36:52] <karlsberg87> ops
[16:37:01] <karlsberg87> here are 1:36
[16:37:03] <karlsberg87> :/
[16:37:12] <kinblas> am?pm?
[16:37:16] <karlsberg87> AM
[16:37:19] <kinblas> heh
[16:37:26] <kinblas> todds a slacker then
[16:37:39] <karlsberg87> im looking the solutions of the users in jquerygallery.com
[16:38:05] <karlsberg87> and everybody create a BIG css assign font-size to a lot of .ui-* class
[16:38:17] <karlsberg87> http://www.jqmgallery.com/
[16:38:24] <karlsberg87> sorry
[16:38:40] <kinblas> karlsberg87: yeah we're familiar with that site :-)
[16:39:09] <kinblas> unfortunately as johnbender said todd and scott and now wilto are the css owners
[16:39:22] <eddiemonge> whats the ?
[16:40:38] <kinblas> they wrote most of it so they know the reasons for why they decided to things certain ways
[16:42:41] <kinblas> eddiemonge: not sure what your question was
[16:43:08] <eddiemonge> i was asking what the question is. whats karlsberg87 question
[16:43:47] <kinblas> eddiemonge: oh, why they decided to use font px versus ems, etc
[16:44:03] <karlsberg87> yes
[16:44:18] <eddiemonge> because pixels are far easier to size correctly
[16:44:53] <karlsberg87> eddiemonge: when you develop a interface for mobile
[16:45:09] <karlsberg87> when you are in   a LDPI screen dont have problem
[16:45:41] <karlsberg87> when you need setup for an HDPI screen you need increase the font size, true?
[16:46:34] <eddiemonge> sometimes. depends on how the browser renders the font
[16:47:03] <karlsberg87> but in a HDPI screen with the same site of the LDPI you EVER see the font TOO little
[16:47:08] <karlsberg87> the fonts, the images, all
[16:47:41] <kinblas> eddiemonge: I'm not sure why they chose to use px
[16:47:45] <karlsberg87> you need target the density screen using media queries by example or using -webkit-pixel-ratio
[16:48:04] <kinblas> eddiemonge: I meant I'm not sure that's why they chose px
[16:48:35] <karlsberg87> then... in common cases, we ever have base.css, mdpi.css and hdpi,css
[16:48:40] <eddiemonge> karlsberg87: dont you have the same issue with ems?
[16:49:12] <karlsberg87> on mdpi and hdpi css files, we adjust the font size and other sizes for a great useability
[16:50:19] <karlsberg87> My question is... normally, eddiemonge you how increase the all UI elements (texts mainly) for HDPI screens?
[16:50:56] <eddiemonge> ...normally i dont worry about it. let me fire up an android emulator to see what it looks like
[16:51:32] <karlsberg87> http://jsfiddle.net/EZrS5/11/ is a test case
[16:52:01] <karlsberg87> eddiemonge: you look that in HDPI devices the text is TOOOOO little, also the images,
[16:52:19] <karlsberg87> because the screen have more density of pixels
[16:56:34] <karlsberg87> eddiemonge: you develop phone uis with jquery mobile?
[16:57:05] <eddiemonge> i develop them without it usually
[16:57:08] <eddiemonge> well native apps
[17:00:20] <karlsberg87> over Webkit ?
[17:00:25] <karlsberg87> WebView
[17:00:28] <karlsberg87> sorry
[17:00:55] <karlsberg87> Im developing under webview using phonegap
[17:03:15] <karlsberg87> eddiemonge:  ?
[17:09:22] <eddiemonge> i think originally px's were used because it was faster to do and initially were only targeting iphones. android is the weird one with the hdpi screens
[17:09:36] <eddiemonge> i do think that we should switch to ems though
[17:10:35] <eddiemonge> oh wait a second
[17:14:19] <eddiemonge> i forgot, its all about the meta viewport tag
[17:14:37] <eddiemonge> karlsberg87: look at jquerymobile.com/test on a hdpi device and it will look "normal"
[17:14:50] <eddiemonge> thus it doesnt matter that px's are used
[17:15:08] <karlsberg87> go try
[17:15:38] <karlsberg87> Using WebView, i develop a app for X10 Mini Pro (QVGA 240x320) and i see all good
[17:15:58] <karlsberg87> later i run the code on my HDPI and i see all TOO litltle
[17:16:14] <karlsberg87> also the header JQM
[17:16:15] <eddiemonge> did you add 	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
[17:16:49] <karlsberg87> i try with a lot of combinations
[17:16:55] <karlsberg87> the correct is this?
[17:17:02] <karlsberg87> go try
[17:17:59] <eddiemonge> add that meta tag right after the meta charset tag (which should be right after the opening <head> tag
[17:23:01] <karlsberg87> eddiemonge:
[17:23:06] <karlsberg87> look same
[17:23:16] <karlsberg87> but... this really scale
[17:23:42] <karlsberg87> scaleup hdpi and scaledown ldpi because use mdpi as standar?
[17:24:14] <eddiemonge> umm, yes?
[17:24:25] <karlsberg87> lossing quality
[17:24:51] <eddiemonge> on 4 inch screens its not really noticeable only your image is really crappy to begin with
[17:25:18] <karlsberg87> and on a tablet?
[17:25:31] <karlsberg87> what the solution?
[17:26:08] <eddiemonge> thats why you dont create an image based layout site for mobile and instead stick to css colors
[17:26:21] <karlsberg87> i also test using target-densitydpi=high-dpi and use big quality images and this must scaledown for mdpi and ldpi but this solution appear dont work on my android 2.1
[17:26:38] <eddiemonge> karlsberg87: do you have a specific site that you are having issues with?
[17:26:49] <karlsberg87> with my app
[17:26:53] <karlsberg87> not a site
[17:27:05] <karlsberg87> what is a image based layour?
[17:27:09] <karlsberg87> layout?
[17:30:12] <karlsberg87> eddiemonge: ? i cannot understand your last phrase
[17:30:33] <karlsberg87> "thats why you dont create an image based layout site for mobile and instead stick to css colors	"
[17:33:23] <eddiemonge> im trying to understand your issue or what you are trying to accomplish
[17:37:06] <karlsberg87> with your fix i find part of solutions
[17:37:22] <karlsberg87> but the scaling way not the correct
[17:37:51] <karlsberg87> everybody recommend use target-densitydpi=device-dpi for no rescale
[17:38:12] <karlsberg87> and use media queries using differents resources and font-sizes
[17:39:20] <karlsberg87> then is easy change the font-size on differents CSS files
[17:39:55] <eddiemonge> thats a lot more work and a lot more code
[17:40:08] <karlsberg87> but my problem with JQM is that i dont know a easy way of scale texts without need assign rules to 20 class
[17:40:28] <karlsberg87> eddiemonge: yes, and better result
[17:41:03] <karlsberg87> http://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/targeting.html
[17:41:07] <karlsberg87> read the end of article
[17:42:34] <karlsberg87> like the original way of native android apps, that automatically use the drawable-hdpi drawable-mdpi or drawable-ldpi resources
[17:42:41] <karlsberg87> under the /res folder
[17:44:06] <eddiemonge> ive read that article before. its pretty informative. though like i said its most work. jqmobile is trying to target the majority of users and the majority are fine with scaling. if people want to do more advanced work they can using the things in that article.
[17:45:27] <karlsberg87> yes!
[17:45:53] <karlsberg87> but i repeat, what is the way for increment the text of the JQM UI elements?
[17:46:03] <karlsberg87> as header text, buttons
[17:46:26] <karlsberg87> With an easy way! without needed of create a rule for 20 classes
[17:46:38] <karlsberg87> 20 or more..
[17:46:55] <karlsberg87> header text, buttons, etc
[17:47:18] <eddiemonge> over write the base font-size
[17:48:12] <eddiemonge> oh nevermind
[17:48:15] <eddiemonge> that wont work.
[17:48:26] <karlsberg87> hehe
[17:48:39] <karlsberg87> im searching still this base font-size
[17:51:27] <karlsberg87> eddiemonge:
[17:51:29] <karlsberg87> * { font-size: 110% !important;}
[17:51:31] <karlsberg87> works fine
[17:51:38] <karlsberg87> but *... its...
[17:51:41] <karlsberg87> lol
[17:51:43] <karlsberg87> no?
[17:51:56] <eddiemonge> thats bad for the * and for the !important
[17:52:12] <karlsberg87> a big waste
[17:52:19] <karlsberg87> !important is CSS3 valid
[17:52:25] <karlsberg87> the waste is the "*"
[17:52:52] <karlsberg87> not exist a way of target only elements with texts no?
[17:55:55] <eddiemonge> the !important is bad because it means if you want to change font sizes any where else, that has to have !important as well
[17:56:44] <eddiemonge> karlsberg87: you could do a search for font-size in the css. There are only about 20 references that you can easily change in a new stylesheet and then include that stylesheet in your hdpi.css
[17:57:34] <karlsberg87> yes, looking the clock im accepting that is the unique way
[17:57:49] <karlsberg87> because toddparker use absolute units!
[17:57:57] <karlsberg87> fork it! hehehe
[17:58:10] <karlsberg87> im waiting to hear a good reason
[17:58:25] <karlsberg87> if dont exist, im thinking fork and send the pull
[17:58:31] <eddiemonge> do it anyway
[17:58:36] <karlsberg87> its more flexible
[17:58:46] <eddiemonge> but be prepared to test it on every device to make a case
[17:59:45] <karlsberg87> because this, im waiting, i think that sure exist a good reason for use abs
[18:01:00] <eddiemonge> like i said, its faster and its good for the majority of people
[18:02:28] <karlsberg87> yes
[18:02:42] <karlsberg87> the unique work is find the same aspect using EM
[18:02:46] <karlsberg87> for the default-sizes
