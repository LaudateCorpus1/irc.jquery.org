[05:05:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] Merge branch 'master' into popup-widget - Gabriel Schulhof
[06:05:29] <uGoMobi_Jasper> _|Nix|_: hi! did you manage to get left offset of popup right on FF/IE? or didnt look at it yet?
[06:47:05] <deAtog> does orientation not work on Android? I see that there are a couple of classes called ui-controlgroup-vertical and ui-controlgroup-horizontal... On my Android 2.2 phone, if I switch from vertical to horizontal the horizontal class is not applied to the controlgroup
[07:22:16] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: thats not changing on orientation change
[07:25:39] <deAtog> nope.. I thought it should.. but it's not
[07:27:28] <deAtog> uGoMobi_Jasper: I don't see anything in jQM binding to the orientationchange event
[07:28:18] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: look in the docs > forms > checkboxes (bottom of page)  there you can read what the classes are used for
[07:30:05] <deAtog> ah ok that makes sense now..
[07:30:38] <deAtog> I don't know what I was doing wrong yesterday.. but I've got the orientationchange event is firing for me today..
[07:31:14] <deAtog> Hopefully I can make this page look good in both portrait and landscape..

[07:37:50] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #4335 from jasondscott/hardcodedActivePage - Ghislain Seguin
[07:39:42] <toddparker> gseguin: I'd rather have the theme + structure in two files and tell people to combine if needed
[07:39:49] <toddparker> easier to combine than split
[07:41:04] <toddparker> deAtog - what's your GitHub name?
[07:42:49] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: Anne, are you there?
[07:47:26] <deAtog> toddparker:deAtog
[08:00:59] <deAtog> toddparker: got a moment to look at something?
[08:31:46] <gseguin> toddparker: that's what I figured, working on it. I'm off today but will hopefully have some time on Sunday to take a stab at it
[08:35:33] <toddparker> deAtog: Cool, easy enough!
[08:36:10] <toddparker> Been seeing you helping out quite a bit…I should say hi and find out more about you
[08:41:33] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NN05kYaPIj_nCJO_iBbkmMGKU9pJDHfgSY1J5dh8PeQ/edit
[08:41:59] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: when you have time can you take a look at that?
[08:43:10] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: just so you know what i am working at. any feedback (additions, priorities, etc.) is welcome :)
[08:50:15] <deAtog> toddparker: Well I've got a couple of mobile web apps to write and I made the decision to write them using jQuery Mobile.. Since it's open source, I tend to improve/fix issues as I can
[08:50:47] <toddparker> deAtog: appreciate the help
[08:51:41] <toddparker> uGoMobi_Jasper: that is awesome
[08:51:46] <toddparker> you are super organized
[08:52:02] <deAtog> toddparker: If time permits, and we get additional funding I might spend a little time reworking the page handling but that'll have to wait until after both apps are written and released
[08:52:13] <agcolom> Hi Jasper, I'm here :-) (for a short time though)
[08:52:21] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: haha yeah i can't deny that
[08:52:27] <toddparker> heh
[08:52:30] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: hi Anne
[08:52:34] <toddparker> that list looks good
[08:52:45] <toddparker> i'll be sure to point things in for direction that seem like a good fit
[08:52:46] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: just wanted to share a Google doc with you
[08:53:00] <uGoMobi_Jasper> in that we can put ideas for popup widget
[08:53:06] <agcolom> Yes, just looking at it now (Ithinkink :-) )
[08:53:06] <uGoMobi_Jasper> examples
[08:53:28] <toddparker> do you want me to answer in the doc?
[08:53:33] <toddparker> or on tickets
[08:53:52] <toddparker> for example, i mentioned on the mini list ticket that we don't want to support that for usability reasons
[08:53:54] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: what you prefer, you can put comments in there yes
[08:54:03] <toddparker> think i'm not allowed uGoMobi_Jasper
[08:54:27] <toddparker> one thing I just saw in the forums is that list view clicks are crazy slow on longer lists
[08:54:32] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: thougt i allowed comments, will check
[08:54:44] <toddparker> i hadn't seen this in testing but was able to reproduce, even on a new 4S
[08:55:00] <agcolom> yes, great idea. I don't know if anyone saw my question on irc yesterday... How do we feel about the possibility to add count bubbles to collapsible headings
[08:55:02] <agcolom> ?
[08:55:26] <agcolom>  <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes I can add comemnts to your doc
[08:55:29] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: did you find the doc?
[08:55:36] <uGoMobi_Jasper> ok cool
[08:55:37] <toddparker> anyone want to give this a look? go to http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-performance.html, scroll down and click
[08:55:43] <agcolom> I think... I've just put a comment
[08:55:44] <uGoMobi_Jasper> the 'ideas list' you can edit
[08:55:47] <toddparker> takes seconds for active state to show, more second to navigate
[08:55:54] <toddparker> that is a perf regression
[08:56:00] <toddparker> a big one
[08:56:07] <toddparker> compared to 1.0.1
[08:56:20] <toddparker> longer delay the further down the page you scroll
[08:58:45] <agcolom> btw, do we have a PHP expert to look at a PR by MauriceG? (Otherwise I'll ask him to put up a test page that I can try before I merge)
[08:59:19] <deAtog> agcolom: define PHP expert..
[08:59:41] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: i program lot of php, actually know it better than javascript ;)
[08:59:49] <johnbender> toddparker: what platform are you testing on
[08:59:50] <uGoMobi_Jasper> oh i see deAtog volunteers :)
[08:59:57] <agcolom> Ok, someone who can look at a simple form submit in PHP
[09:00:19] <uGoMobi_Jasper> i already had a quick look Anne
[09:00:21] <agcolom> toddparker: I don't seem to see any delay...
[09:00:47] <uGoMobi_Jasper> but so many changes so its easier to just test it
[09:00:49] <agcolom> uGoMobi_Jasper cool! Do you think it's ok to pull?
[09:01:26] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: can say that yet, have to give it thorough look
[09:02:47] <toddparker> i'm testing that page on an iPhone 4S running the latest build of iOS
[09:02:55] <agcolom> Here it is, if someone else can give some feedfack also? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4256
[09:02:56] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1w, 3d ago): Docs: Suggestion to renew the self-submit form (forms-sample-selfsubmit.php)
[09:04:08] <toddparker> agcolom: that is a pretty extensive re-write
[09:04:14] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: Maurice created two PR's for that page... don't pull both :)
[09:04:20] <toddparker> if you tested this locally and it runs, let's pull it in
[09:04:25] <toddparker> it's clearly busted now
[09:04:25] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: its whole new page
[09:04:31] <toddparker> ah
[09:04:43] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: yes it is busted because of the php short tags in it
[09:04:55] <toddparker> uGoMobi_Jasper: this is the first part - https://github.com/MauriceG/jquery-mobile/commit/b5afe9eddd6f98315187dca8661ce5c63417e08d
[09:04:56] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1w, 3d ago): Docs: Suggestion to renew the self-submit form (forms-sample-selfsubmit.php)
[09:05:29] <toddparker> that looks like it's not a new page
[09:05:48] <toddparker> sorry, just reading up
[09:06:00] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[09:06:22] <toddparker> so anyone else have a newer iPhone to test that list perf page?
[09:06:26] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: well it looks like a whole different example then the one on the current page
[09:07:06] <toddparker> it does
[09:07:07] <agcolom> is actually painful on the iPod Touch iOS 5.0.1
[09:07:17] <toddparker> he re-wrote it
[09:07:28] <toddparker> agcolom: yeah, right?
[09:07:34] <toddparker> was it ok on another device?
[09:07:44] <toddparker> wonder if there is an issue with 5.0.1
[09:08:01] <agcolom> is terribly slow on iOS5.0.1
[09:08:04] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: agcolom: i will put Maurice his PR on my brand new to do list :)
[09:08:09] <toddparker> i'm running 5.1.1
[09:08:17] <toddparker> cool uGoMobi_Jasper
[09:08:26] <toddparker> if it works, it's ok to pull in
[09:08:32] <toddparker> the older code isn't sacred
[09:08:50] <toddparker> so agcolom - was it ok on an older/different device?
[09:08:57] <toddparker> kinblas: you around? good Q for you
[09:09:16] <deAtog> toddparker: the php code is a little wordy.. IE there's plenty of if (isset(...)) { $var = <value> } else { $var = "" }.. which is probably better written as $var = isset(...) ? <value> : "";
[09:09:32] <agcolom> Yes, just checked I'm running 5.0.1 (iPod Touch model MC547BT) it's the one with the camera
[09:09:42] <toddparker> and it's bad
[09:10:07] <toddparker> deAtog: i'm no PHP expert but it did seem pretty um, literal
[09:10:19] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: brackets can be ommited when its on same line indeed
[09:10:21] <toddparker> it doesn't need to be super efficient code i duppose
[09:10:34] <toddparker> but it should be solid code
[09:10:47] <agcolom> very very bad. About 8-10 seconds to highlight the line I've clicked on
[09:10:49] <toddparker> so if either of you want to take a crack at improving
[09:10:52] <toddparker> yeah
[09:11:14] <toddparker> kinblas, johnbender, gseguin - we have a pretty bad perf issue
[09:11:16] <toddparker> go to http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-performance.html, scroll down and click a list item. it takes seconds to flip the active state, second more to navigate and it frequently crashes
[09:11:19] <agcolom> can try on another iPod Touch iOS 4 I think...
[09:11:22] <toddparker> it's better in 1.0.1
[09:11:35] <toddparker> can't think of what would cause this tho
[09:12:25] <agcolom> Yes, I think that's the one I'm looking at.
[09:12:26] <deAtog> uGoMobi_Jasper: The whole if .. else construct can be avoided so that the variable being declared is more prevalent rather than being in the body of the if/else blocks
[09:13:11] <agcolom> just crashed!
[09:13:24] <toddparker> yeah, crashes for me
[09:13:41] <toddparker> i tested this page and it was ok around 1.1.0
[09:13:46] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: that makes sense yes, didn't give it a good look yet since it's not easy to read on github
[09:13:49] <toddparker> i need to roll back and test
[09:13:59] <agcolom> but on the iPod Touch, I was just getting the li highlighted, i was not being redirected.
[09:14:08] <deAtog> toddparker: the other thing I noticed during my initial glance is that he's not using the checked property per HTML specs.. he's just outputting checked on radio buttons rather than checked="checked"
[09:15:10] <agcolom> I have to go now to take my daughter to her guitar lesson... I'll be back later this evening...
[09:15:29] <toddparker> hmm
[09:18:15] <agcolom> quick test on my old iTouch... only still seeing the rotating loader after 20 seconds...
[09:18:42] <agcolom> sorry meant still only seeing the rotating loader
[09:19:12] <agcolom> iOS 3.0
[09:19:31] <agcolom> (I can check iOS 4.3 I think when I get back (iPAd)
[09:20:10] <deAtog> toddparker: the checked thing may be ok.. docs on w3schools.com says it's okay
[09:20:36] <gseguin> oh noes! no w3schools!
[09:21:24] <gseguin> http://w3fools.com/
[09:23:15] <gseguin> deAtog: ^
[09:23:18] <gseguin> toddparker: let me know what I can help with, shoot me an email, I'll be offline for most of the day
[09:29:40] <johnbender> toddparker: hmmm
[09:33:38] <deAtog> gseguin: yeah I know they're not affiliated and that the docs could be wrong according to the spec.. but they tend to provide the correct syntax that's compatible with all browsers.. just because it's in the spec doesn't mean it was implemented properly in all of the browsers available
[09:37:08] <agcolom> Sometimes I love BT for once the connection is working ;-)
[09:40:48] <toddparker> never trust a damn thing w3schools says
[09:41:18] <toddparker> there's lies, theres' damn lies, then there's the w3schools
[09:43:28] <agcolom> What's the deal with w3schools? (A lot of students use it and I don't know who told them to!) I've even seen one student with w3schools books!!!!
[09:48:03] <agcolom> toddparker: Do you have an A4 or A5 flyer on jQuery Mobile?
[09:50:25] <ryanneufeld> I've noticed when loading pages, that sometimes you can still see the starting page flash for a second before the content is ajaxed in
[09:50:48] <ryanneufeld> have we messed with some css/js that we shouldn't have?
[09:51:41] <ryanneufeld> hmm... the docs site doesn't seem to do that
[09:58:51] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm trying to finish up the grunt js and css targets
[09:58:55] <johnbender> toddparker: after that I can take a loook
[09:59:14] <toddparker> ok

[09:59:45] <toddparker> ryanneufeld: are you using fixed toolbars?
[09:59:54] <toddparker> that can make things less smooth
[10:00:24] <ryanneufeld> no, we turned those off
[10:00:28] <ryanneufeld> cause it wasn't working
[10:02:12] <ryanneufeld> I'll have to keep playing
[10:02:23] <toddparker> that does seem odd. you're using 1.1.0 CSS and JS?

[10:04:02] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: yes I just commented

[10:04:57] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: yes >>> no, not a real issue
[10:05:42] <agcolom>  uGoMobi_Jasper: do I need to close?
[10:06:21] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: was only thinking... is there anything in the docs about a 'listview buttonMarkup method' or did he/she made that up
[10:06:47] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: it sounded like it was mentioned somewhere
[10:07:26] <agcolom> uGoMobi_Jasper: no idea. I can check...
[10:07:31] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: but i don't think there is anything in the docs about the buttonMarkup function
[10:07:57] <agcolom> toddparker: will add that ... it's very nice indeed.
[10:08:44] <uGoMobi_Jasper> somebody messed with the split buttons
[10:08:58] <agcolom>  uGoMobi_Jasper http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-options.html
[10:09:03] <uGoMobi_Jasper> the split button icons look like my eyes after 10 beer/wine
[10:09:24] <agcolom> uGoMobi_Jasper do you have a link?
[10:10:00] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: link to what?
[10:10:43] <agcolom> to -> the split button icons look like my eyes after 10 beer/wine

[10:29:25] <toddparker> anyone know how to see a list of commits by person in the new github UI?
[10:29:41] <toddparker> Used to work from here, but now you just see the person's profile - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/graphs/contributors
[10:36:00] <toddparker> uGoMobi_Jasper: Do you know how to write unit tests? Be good to make sure you add unit tests with each fix to avoid future regressions
[10:36:43] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: no i don't know how to do that yet, will look into it
[10:39:37] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: when you click on number of commits below the name you get the list
[10:42:00] <toddparker> ah!
[10:42:14] <toddparker> gray text = link, ok sure
[10:42:40] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes that one
[10:42:44] <toddparker> just saw your comment uGoMobi_Jasper - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/4b276de999310348e8071109b38428a8ffab0b53#commitcomment-1321393

How fixed: Used '>' css to target only direct children
[10:42:58] <toddparker> do you have a suggested tweak?
[10:45:06] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes
[10:46:28] <uGoMobi_Jasper> Will put it in comment, not new PR
[10:46:36] <toddparker> ok
[11:01:11] <agcolom> toddparker: tutorial added
[11:03:07] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4317 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4336
[11:03:08] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4317 on jquery-mobile (rskokan; 3d, 5h ago): Changing button's data-theme programatically
[11:04:49] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: both issues show that people dont know how enhancement works in JQM
[11:05:15] <agcolom> uGoMobi_Jasper yes!!!! the docs need improving on that!
[11:05:28] <agcolom> And that example page is badly needed also!
[11:05:50] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: so besides example code about how to dynamically inject content we should also cover manipulating/alter (how to say?) things
[11:06:09] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: yes obvious
[11:06:22] <agcolom> 100% agree.
[11:06:57] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: people expect magic but they do need to trigger some kind of action like create or refresh in their code
[11:08:04] <agcolom> Yes, I've solved a few on exactly that topic before you joined... and that's how I realised this was not straight forward and examples would help
[11:09:12] <agcolom> the problem is many will use google to solve a problem instead of using their brain!
[11:09:51] <agcolom> (sorry maybe I shouldn't have said that ;-) )
[11:11:22] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: haha... using both is best if you ask me
[11:11:47] <uGoMobi_Jasper> first see if somebody else already had same issue to point you in right direction for solution
[11:12:30] <uGoMobi_Jasper> and then use brain to actually fix it
[11:12:40] <agcolom> yes, some stop at the 1st step ;-) and the create was missing
[11:14:09] <agcolom> The good news is that I only have about 10 exam scripts to mark so will be able to do some triage and do the popup video example this weekend
[11:14:21] <uGoMobi_Jasper> cool
[11:15:08] <agcolom> for the create dynamic content, I think we need to split in a few categories:
[11:15:28] <agcolom> create new simple element/new group element
[11:16:08] <agcolom> then modify an existing element (modify style/modify text?)
[11:16:18] <agcolom> could we also remove an element ?
[11:16:57] <agcolom> (so on your last big list of examples, could we have the add button as you have it, and could we add a remove button?)
[11:18:27] <agcolom> and I guess some add will also be different and will need another category for list items, collapsible items, select options?
[11:18:52] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes is possible
[11:19:20] <uGoMobi_Jasper> ^^ removing i mean
[11:19:44] <agcolom> great!
[11:20:02] <uGoMobi_Jasper> controlgroups are deifferent from other widgets like listviews
[11:20:44] <agcolom> yes, so we need that as a separate category
[11:21:13] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes
[11:21:32] <uGoMobi_Jasper> i m thinking... rest is pretty much the same i think
[11:21:46] <uGoMobi_Jasper> havent done much widht collapsible(-sets) yet
[11:21:57] <agcolom> I have an example I think
[11:22:01] <uGoMobi_Jasper> have to check the code how that exactly works

[11:24:09] <ryanneufeld> toddparker: I think I found the 'problem' it's that when you tap a link that triggers a transition, you get scrolled to the top of the page first
[11:24:17] <ryanneufeld> is there a way to disable that?
[11:25:22] <agcolom> uGoMobi_Jasper just added a comment... can you see it ?
[11:25:54] <agcolom> (It was just to solve some issues others had so the code will be 'hack type' not elegant ;-) )
[11:26:21] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: i can see the comments
[11:26:51] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: i thought you were going to put them in this doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZC4Q5qloqk2zXLoh4_Vbq-rN9vBQDOVigrMZMkFBoZw/edit
[11:27:01] <uGoMobi_Jasper> that one you can edit
[11:27:38] <uGoMobi_Jasper> i copied them
[11:28:57] <agcolom> Perfect, Thanks, yes, I can edit, that's great, thanks,
[12:03:17] <_|Nix|_> .join #perl
[12:03:18] <socialhapy> _|Nix|_: Sorry, admins only
[12:03:21] <_|Nix|_> Whoops :)
[12:05:02] <uGoMobi_Jasper> _|Nix|_: trying to hack the room?
[12:06:19] <agcolom> toddparker: on jquerymobile.com, the 'Resources: Books, plugins, tutorials' link in 'Easy to use: Try it now!' section points to http://jquerymobile.com/demos/
[12:08:12] <uGoMobi_Jasper> have to go... have a great weekend all!
[12:08:58] <agcolom> have a great weekend Jasper :-)
[12:09:29] <uGoMobi_Jasper> thanks Anne, you too :)
[12:39:57] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... what magick is this SASL?
[12:41:00] <toddparker> right agcolom - i'll fix now
[12:42:54] <agcolom> toddparker: great, thanks.
[12:43:59] <toddparker> fixed: http://jquerymobile.com/
[12:44:06] <toddparker> tell me if I did it
[12:45:16] <agcolom> still pointing to demo but sometimes it takes 5 mins or so to work... and sometimes the chages appear straightaway...
[12:45:33] <agcolom> let me try again. could also be cache issue...
[12:47:30] <agcolom> still the same but I've had a case last week where the change took some time to appear... and I thought I was going mad!
[12:48:38] <agcolom> Are you editing it in Wordpress?
[12:50:10] <toddparker> oh, add something to the url
[12:50:26] <agcolom> yes?
[12:50:33] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/?HiAnne
[12:51:01] <toddparker> breaks the cache
[12:51:59] <agcolom> no still good old one :-( page info says Modified 11 May 2012 20:06:49
[12:52:30] <agcolom> which i suppose is my local time so just under 50 minutes ago
[12:54:19] <toddparker> agcolom - totally agree on the docs changes - we really need to have real examples of how to do dynamic stuff across the board
[12:54:36] <agcolom> good :-)
[12:54:53] <toddparker> we can blow up the docs and re-org
[12:55:40] <toddparker> we also do need to think about following the jQuery core XML API doc style
[12:55:42] <toddparker> eventually
[12:56:24] <agcolom> I was thinking of adding something that worked like the basic/option/etc/ and add examples (those pages do not have or need options,etc...)
[12:56:40] <toddparker> that would be good
[12:56:42] <agcolom> I need to look at the jQuery core XML API doc style
[12:56:47] <toddparker> yeah
[12:57:20] <toddparker> ultimately, we do need the "just the API" docs in XML and the docs can focus more on how to use + demos
[12:58:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We should use something like doxygen ...
[12:58:54] <agcolom> what is it?
[12:59:54] <agcolom> Although I really like the way the docs is displayed...
[13:00:37] <agcolom> How does it work for the jQuery core docs? is the XML transformed using XSLT or something else?
[13:12:16] <toddparker> yep, it's transformed
[13:12:33] <toddparker> so it could be used to populate the options | methods | events tabs
[13:12:42] <agcolom> yes.
[13:12:54] <toddparker> we could still create the narrative and demo-focused pages
[13:13:01] <agcolom> still no luck for me on the jquerymobile.com
[13:13:33] <agcolom> oh yes. even if we get started on the xml docs, it will take a while to get it all done!
[13:14:09] <toddparker> still see the old version?
[13:14:38] <toddparker> just checking - the " Resources: Books, plugins, tutorials" link now points to /resources/
[13:14:41] <toddparker> that was the change, right?
[13:14:42] <agcolom> yes, and still the old time. It's like the server is not yet providing the updated version
[13:14:51] <agcolom> yes
[13:14:57] <toddparker> did you try changing the query parameter
[13:15:16] <toddparker> we use a ton of caching
[13:15:44] <agcolom> yes I did... hand on, I'll try on the iPhone simulator...
[13:16:34] <agcolom> same :-(
[13:16:39] <agcolom> is it ok for you?
[13:17:50] <agcolom> done!
[13:18:08] <agcolom> your change now appears ;-)
[13:18:57] <agcolom> the time of the modified page appears as 11 May 2012 21:16:21 (2 mins ago!)
[13:21:14] <agcolom> toddparker: do you have any 'jQuery Mobile' information for dummies (kind of level)?
[13:28:22] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker: I'm going to merge the grunt work into master
[13:29:06] <johnbender> js and css are basically finished just have to decide when we feel comfortable switching the actual build over
[13:29:51] <johnbender> still need to update the README with build information too
[13:31:29] <johnbender> toddparker: agcolom: anything but xslt
[13:31:32] <johnbender> anything
[13:32:01] <agcolom> johnbender: ok ;-)
[13:32:07] <agcolom> I was just asking ;-)
[13:34:07] <johnbender> lol
[13:34:11] <johnbender> I'm _mostly_ joking
[13:34:58] <agcolom> dinner time... sorry catch you later...
[13:54:35] <toddparker> hey agcolom likes XSLT
[13:54:42] <toddparker> but i agree
[13:55:13] <toddparker> hey, somebody has to transform that XML. It aint' gonna turn into HTML by itself johnbender
[13:56:49] <agcolom> I wonder whether that could make a good student project...
[13:57:36] <toddparker> might be, yeah
[13:57:42] <toddparker> gotta put the kids to work!
[13:58:38] <agcolom> exactly! I'll see if I can get someone interested... Do you have some info on how it's done for jquery core?
[13:58:49] <toddparker> trying to ask for details now
[14:11:32] <toddparker> ok agcolom - i just emailed karl s.
[14:11:41] <agcolom> cool, thanks
[14:11:44] <toddparker> he's the docs guy for core
[14:11:45] <toddparker> np

[14:14:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] [popup and docs] Heed data-transition when specified on the link - Gabriel Schulhof
[14:14:55] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ^
[14:15:39] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, now the popup continues to have a transition option, but it will be swept aside for a single open/close cycle if there's a data-transition specified on the link that opens the popup.
[14:16:01] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: However, if you open the popup at a later time with .popup( "open" ), then it will open with its own transition.
[14:22:29] <toddparker> cool
[14:22:34] <toddparker> thanks _|Nix|_
[14:25:15] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: did you adjust where the data-transition attr goes (link vs popup)?
[14:25:18] <toddparker> doesn't seem so
[14:58:57] <agcolom> _Nix_ I think I've got bugs now with the popups
[14:59:25] <agcolom> transition slide: popup doesn't come up
[14:59:40] <agcolom> tranistion slide up: cannot dismiss the popup
[15:06:59] <toddparker> are you putting these transition attrs on the link or popup?
[15:11:15] <agcolom> as they were on the old demo. I guess I have to change that?
[15:13:41] <agcolom> they are on the link
[15:43:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to popup-widget: http://git.io/ayibdQ
[15:43:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] [popup documentation] Give a more detailed explanation about transitions - Gabriel Schulhof
[15:43:48] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Can you give me a step-by-step to reproduce?
[15:45:47] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: "did you adjust where the data-transition attr goes (link vs popup)" What do you mean?
[15:46:03] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: You can now add a data-transition to the link and the popup will use it.
[15:46:34] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Check the updated transitions example in the doc. It's using transitions specified in the links.
[15:46:53] <agcolom> Hold on, let me try again...
[15:49:12] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/okehir/65/
[15:50:47] <agcolom> all the ones with popup transition are ok
[15:51:39] <_|Nix|_> Noticing the problem ...
[15:51:55] <agcolom> Tooltip has slideup and it comes up but won't go away
[15:52:19] <agcolom> flip (photo) works fine
[15:53:49] <agcolom> actually, it seems all works except slide (any form I guess): slide and slide up have problems
[15:58:54] <agcolom> Really have to go to bed now... Goodnight everyone...
[16:11:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: agcolom mispeled one of the transitions, and that's what's breaking the tooltip in http://jsbin.com/okehir/65/ ...
[16:16:35] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ yes all works now!!!!
[16:16:44] <agcolom> (got your email)
[16:16:57] <agcolom> the slide is really cool!!!

[19:08:40] <toddmparker_> errr...crap did i do something wrong?
[19:14:03] <Wilto> What’s up?
[19:15:40] <toddmparker_> i think i did something wrong
[19:15:48] <toddmparker_> see that commit Wilto
[19:15:55] <toddmparker_> what did i do
[19:16:20] <Wilto> “Merge branch 'popup-widget' … into popup-widget”
[19:16:22] <Wilto> …Huh.
[19:16:28] <toddmparker_> yeah. huh.
[19:16:40] <toddmparker_> is that possible?
[19:16:48] <Wilto> I uh… I mean, if you had to merge something into it, I guess that’s one of the better things.
[19:16:54] <toddmparker_> my question: can I just revert that?
[19:17:04] <Wilto> Not after it’s pushed, I don’t think.
[19:17:45] <toddmparker_> err
[19:17:47] <Wilto> Wait, what was in the real commit? Adding stuff to the docs?
[19:17:51] <toddmparker_> but what did i even do??
[19:17:57] <Wilto> It looks okay.
[19:18:09] <toddmparker_> hmm
[19:18:23] <Wilto> Whoop, maybe not. This looks like a job for gseguin or johnbender.
[19:18:43] <toddmparker_> i emailed bender
[19:19:46] <toddmparker_> and not ghislain
[19:20:07] <toddmparker_> i was just reviewing a tiny change to a css file
[19:20:22] <toddmparker_> far as I know I was working in master
[19:20:27] <toddmparker_> that's why this freaks me
[19:21:23] <Wilto> No new commits in master.
[19:21:35] <Wilto> And I know these files were in popup-widget already… weird.
