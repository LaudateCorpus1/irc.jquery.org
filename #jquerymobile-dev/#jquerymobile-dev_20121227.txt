[08:49:36] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker_: are we going to have a meeting today i cant remember?
[08:50:01] <toddmparker_> if there are a bunch of people, we can do a quick meeting
[08:50:09] <toddmparker_> haven't seen many people online, you?
[08:50:45] <arschmitz> toddmparker_:no no one yet today
[08:51:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you here?
[09:09:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: i know your probably not done with the docs for slide panel but the only event you have listed is create there is also open before open close and before close (also it should be panelcreate) 
[09:12:14] <arschmitz> well kinda panel create thats such a weird one for widget events when documenting
[09:14:05] <arschmitz> at least the way we document it in docs the api docs clear it up though
[09:15:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am here
[09:16:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hi i didnt need anything toddmparker_: and i were just talking about if we were having a meeting and wasent sure if you were around or not
[09:16:58] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:17:15] <uGoMobi> going to have dinner soon but I will be back for meeting
[09:17:27] <uGoMobi> we can discuss slider and rangeslider inputs
[09:17:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i talked to toddmparker about it yesterday
[09:18:10] <uGoMobi> yeah I noticed
[09:18:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: he pretty much had the same oppinion that he wasent crazy about the look but that there probably isnt a better default option
[09:18:50] <arschmitz> that we should have lots of demos of different looks though
[09:19:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe someone else has a different idea though
[09:20:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: problem is that it really easy to override the CSS, but yes we can show how-to in demo
[09:20:48] <uGoMobi> ok lets discuss later... dinner time here
[09:21:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool im heading to lunch here :)
[10:25:01] <toddmparker_> might just be the 3 of us
[10:25:16] <toddmparker_> so maybe we can just check in informally here
[10:25:23] <toddmparker_> going to grab some food, brb
[10:58:45] <agcolom> hi! I have been catching up with sleep and traveling so I have no update for this week....
[11:04:37] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: uGoMobi: hi so informal meeting in here i guess?
[11:04:54] <toddmparker_> sure, we can just check in on progress
[11:04:57] <toddmparker_> how goes?
[11:05:15] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker_ and arschmitz 
[11:05:26] <arschmitz> good snowy!
[11:05:42] <arschmitz> a foot so far today
[11:05:48] <toddmparker_> wow
[11:05:50] <arschmitz> how is it in boston?
[11:05:54] <toddmparker_> 4" and rain in CT
[11:05:59] <toddmparker_> slushy
[11:06:12] <uGoMobi> no snow, just rain... welcome in holland
[11:06:19] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:06:24] <arschmitz> yeah its all snow here they are saying we are going to get up to 18" today and tonight
[11:06:27] <toddmparker_> sounds nice
[11:06:32] <toddmparker_> yikes
[11:06:37] <uGoMobi> wow
[11:07:02] <arschmitz> yeah they havent plowed my road yet so was intresting when i went to lunch ha ha
[11:07:22] <toddmparker_> you went out?!
[11:07:22] <uGoMobi> so shall we discuss slider/rangeslider styling?
[11:07:35] <arschmitz> yeah i have AWD no biggie lol
[11:07:45] <toddmparker_> nice
[11:07:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: where are you at with the css on it?
[11:07:55] <uGoMobi> no snowmobile arschmitz ? ;)
[11:08:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no lol i live in the city
[11:08:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am done with the CSS
[11:08:27] <uGoMobi> point is
[11:08:31] <uGoMobi> i don't like it
[11:08:52] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/range/docs/demos/sliders/sliders.html
[11:09:09] <uGoMobi> looks ok on desktop
[11:09:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the part you dont like is on narrow screens right?
[11:09:23] <uGoMobi> right
[11:09:27] <toddmparker_> scales up really well when you bump up your font size
[11:09:29] <uGoMobi> messy layout
[11:09:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yeah its perfect for large screen
[11:09:54] <toddmparker_> is this with the full width slider
[11:10:03] <toddmparker_> w/ inputs above?
[11:10:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: when you make the window smaller than 448px you will see what happens
[11:10:28] <toddmparker_> or in general?
[11:10:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i like it everywhere execpt when there is no layout
[11:10:41] <uGoMobi> input above slider for both regular as rangeslider
[11:11:05] <toddmparker_> oh, i see
[11:11:18] <toddmparker_> for some reason, i thought that was an option/class
[11:11:18] <arschmitz> not not layout no label lol
[11:11:36] <toddmparker_> and that the input would be next to the slider, even at narrow widths
[11:11:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: we could use a class to opt-in
[11:12:00] <toddmparker_> we might want to
[11:12:13] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: the problem with that is that when u use both a slider and rangeslider it doesn't look good
[11:12:17] <arschmitz> yeah i think it should be an option
[11:12:17] <toddmparker_> just so it works like it always did with a single slider
[11:12:24] <johnbender> arschmitz: do we have an open pull request for slider setup?
[11:12:34] <uGoMobi> hi johnbender 
[11:12:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hey
[11:12:51] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender 
[11:12:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I agree it's better to leave the slider as it was
[11:12:59] <toddmparker_> yeah
[11:13:00] <uGoMobi> always input next to slider
[11:13:03] <toddmparker_> right
[11:13:07] <arschmitz> johnbender: not sure what you mean slider setup?
[11:13:16] <johnbender> arschmitz: the dual handle slider
[11:13:20] <toddmparker_> if we want to add a class to move it above, that's fine
[11:13:34] <arschmitz> not a pull request no i dont think so?
[11:13:35] <uGoMobi> johnbender: it is in branch "range"
[11:13:41] <johnbender> cool
[11:14:08] <toddmparker_> i think consistency is good here
[11:14:09] <johnbender> wondering where I can do inline commenting
[11:14:14] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: the problem is that it isnt only CSS
[11:14:30] <toddmparker_> so at mobile sizes, the label stacks above but inputs are next to the sider
[11:14:35] <uGoMobi> we have to wrap the slider in another div if we want to make it possible
[11:14:43] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: i see
[11:15:01] <uGoMobi> that is... both input above slider and the fieldcontain styling
[11:15:02] <toddmparker_> that is less than ideal
[11:15:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: arschmitz: is it the rangeslider or slider
[11:15:24] <uGoMobi> and wrapping it in another div is the other thing i don't like
[11:15:29] <arschmitz> rangeslider is the two handle one
[11:15:34] <arschmitz> slider is regular
[11:15:36] <toddmparker_> so if we don't like the complexity, why don't we skip this
[11:15:39] <uGoMobi> next to that it looks messy with input above
[11:15:51] <toddmparker_> and just have inputs next to the slider
[11:15:52] <Wilto> zachleat: ONE OF US. ONE OF US.
[11:16:03] <johnbender> lulz
[11:16:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I think that we are about to decide that
[11:16:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm off until the second btw
[11:16:17] <johnbender> Adobe shutdown
[11:16:26] <johnbender> I completely forgot to remind you :(
[11:16:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: when we first discussed this some time ago we all thought it would be a good idea to do the same for slider
[11:16:50] <Wilto> Do they call it a “shutdown” or, like, “Adobe ClosedOffice Edge?”
[11:16:51] <uGoMobi> but turns out not to be a good idea if you ask me
[11:16:54] <arschmitz> johnbender: if you have time in a minute i have a question about the navigate event
[11:16:55] <Wilto> (hi bender)
[11:17:03] <johnbender> arschmitz: sure thing
[11:17:07] <johnbender> Wilto: yo!
[11:17:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what do you say? get rid of input above slider for regular sider?
[11:17:21] <uGoMobi> slider*
[11:17:30] <johnbender> Wilto: and lol
[11:17:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im really tossed
[11:17:47] <arschmitz> its better for usability and not a simple fix with css
[11:17:53] <arschmitz> to make it go above
[11:18:30] <arschmitz> but it dosent always look good thats for sure
[11:18:34] <uGoMobi> it is a bit complex yes
[11:18:38] <toddmparker_> right
[11:19:00] <arschmitz> on smal screens the usability is really much better with it above
[11:19:02] <toddmparker_> i think it's a nice option but we can always add it later
[11:19:17] <uGoMobi> ok, I will remove it for now
[11:19:28] <uGoMobi> how about the rangeslider?
[11:19:45] <uGoMobi> there we still want the inputs after the label on narrow screens?
[11:19:48] <toddmparker_> so where are we at? 
[11:19:52] <arschmitz> rangeslider it is almost unusable on small screens if you dont put them above
[11:20:00] <arschmitz> so i think we have to
[11:20:25] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[11:20:43] <arschmitz> it makes the slider just two short to have two handles in my oppinion
[11:20:49] <uGoMobi> how about 3 rows
[11:20:52] <uGoMobi> 1 label
[11:20:57] <toddmparker_> so is the complexity because of where the inputs are
[11:20:59] <uGoMobi> 2 the inputs at both ends
[11:21:02] <toddmparker_> they bookend the slider
[11:21:03] <uGoMobi> 3 the slider
[11:21:11] <arschmitz> there is no change in complexity on range
[11:21:17] <arschmitz> because it already has a wrapper
[11:21:26] <arschmitz> this could be a class config here
[11:21:35] <uGoMobi> yes it is easier for rangeslider
[11:21:53] <toddmparker_> seems that these should be consistent though, right?
[11:21:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i originally had a class to make it three rows like that 
[11:22:09] <toddmparker_> devil's advocate here
[11:22:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yes thats why we originally decided to make them go above on slider
[11:22:53] <arschmitz> but if rangeslider is very hard to use with them beside on small screens thats not a good option
[11:23:19] <toddmparker_> i can see that
[11:23:50] <arschmitz> complexity vs usability vs looks and not a great option lol
[11:24:10] <toddmparker_> yeah, that
[11:24:17] <toddmparker_> let's break this down
[11:24:19] <uGoMobi> for slider it is easier when the input and slider go on 2 rows, without having the input after the label
[11:24:31] <toddmparker_> 1. there is a css complexity problem
[11:24:36] <uGoMobi> that wouldn't require wrapping in another div
[11:24:54] <toddmparker_> 2. there is a visual design problem of how to style the inputs on the same line as the label
[11:25:18] <toddmparker_> 3. there is a usability issue with dual handles + inputs being on the same line
[11:25:33] <agcolom> hi everyone :-) are we still looking at the demo here? http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/range.html
[11:25:45] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom 
[11:25:46] <uGoMobi> no
[11:25:50] <arschmitz> agcolom: no thats out of date now 
[11:25:58] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/range/docs/demos/sliders/sliders.html
[11:26:20] <agcolom> ok, thanks!
[11:26:57] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: the visual design problem is also because the slider/rangeslider itself needs margin left and right
[11:27:01] <uGoMobi> for the handle
[11:27:10] <toddmparker_> i see
[11:27:37] <arschmitz> toddmparker: personally i think basic usability should be first priority. 
[11:27:38] <uGoMobi> if you have the input(s) above the slider and no label it looks messy
[11:27:40] <toddmparker_> so on #3, do we think having the inputs on the same line as the dual slider is a no-go?
[11:27:57] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: thats my personal feeling
[11:28:09] <uGoMobi> smallest screens are 240px ?
[11:28:11] <toddmparker_> do we have an older demo showing that?
[11:28:16] <arschmitz> (maybe i just have fat fingers lol )
[11:28:38] <uGoMobi> inputs take approx. 80px
[11:28:39] <toddmparker_> 240 is a possibility, but probably nothing we should optimize for imho
[11:29:13] <uGoMobi> yeah i agree... just calculating how many px left for the slider in worse case
[11:29:17] <agcolom> on FF the page does not load. 
[11:29:32] <toddmparker_> what if we nixed the spinner buttons on desktop and tweaked padding on the inputs
[11:30:04] <toddmparker_> i see the inputs acting primarily as feedback of the values
[11:30:10] <toddmparker_> and secondarily as inputs
[11:30:36] <uGoMobi> yes we can make them smaller
[11:30:41] <arschmitz> toddmparker: not a bad idea many browsers dont have them anyway
[11:30:42] <toddmparker_> so i'd be in favor of downplaying the form styling on them to save space
[11:31:11] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: right. most native sliders don't even provide feedback of the value
[11:31:15] <toddmparker_> let alone and input
[11:31:55] <toddmparker_> i think we can all agree that the inputs now, even mini are still a bit clunky
[11:32:20] <arschmitz> whats the css prop to remove the spinner buttons i forget?
[11:32:21] <uGoMobi> yes i agree
[11:32:43] <uGoMobi> webkit-outer-spinner or something
[11:32:49] <uGoMobi> its already in slider CSS
[11:33:03] <uGoMobi> because we nix the margin on it
[11:33:35] <uGoMobi> if we make the inputs smaller we can leave them next to the slider also for range
[11:34:00] <uGoMobi> and make it easy to hide the inputs and make slider full width with bit custom CSS
[11:34:12] <toddmparker_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3975769/disable-webkits-spin-buttons-on-input-type-number
[11:34:20] <uGoMobi> and we will add the tooltip label demo
[11:34:39] <toddmparker_> i think we can also nix the border on the input and tweak adding a bit
[11:34:58] <uGoMobi> yes minimal amount of padding
[11:35:02] <toddmparker_> so the input style is very subtle but the inner shadow hints that it's editable
[11:35:11] <arschmitz> yeah that will improve both slider and rangeslider i think
[11:35:30] <arschmitz> and super easy to modify with css to turn them back into traditional inputs
[11:35:59] <uGoMobi> ok sounds like a good plan to me
[11:36:11] <uGoMobi> I can adjust the CSS tomorrow
[11:36:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool 
[11:36:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: FF doesnt work indeed
[11:36:46] <uGoMobi> is something in the JS
[11:36:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:agcolom ill take a look.
[11:37:27] <agcolom> http://f.cl.ly/items/3g171S1o0k1A3D0f0U1w/error.tiff
[11:37:38] <uGoMobi> preventInputUpdate 
[11:38:40] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:38:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: other things I work on this week is finishing table styling demo page and dynamic popup demo page
[11:38:55] <arschmitz> i see the problem im fixing it right now
[11:39:04] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: great. are those done or in-progress?
[11:39:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: popup demo is done on own repo but still something i would like to improve...
[11:40:02] <uGoMobi> its with images and uses jQuery load event to check if image has been loaded
[11:40:10] <uGoMobi> that has some caveats
[11:40:15] <toddmparker_> http://i.imgur.com/BHiMA.png
[11:40:27] <uGoMobi> if image has not been loaded yet the popup will have wrong size and position
[11:40:29] <toddmparker_> ^^ that is a quick firebug hack
[11:40:44] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: i see. fun.
[11:40:47] <uGoMobi> i get a 404
[11:40:53] <toddmparker_> on that url?
[11:41:03] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes
[11:41:05] <toddmparker_> hmm
[11:41:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: works for me i did the same thing in chrome while we were talking lol
[11:41:14] <toddmparker_> that work for anyone else?
[11:41:17] <toddmparker_> ah, cool
[11:41:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: url works fine for me
[11:41:54] <agcolom> works for me too :-)
[11:42:13] <uGoMobi> ah now it load
[11:42:15] <toddmparker_> input.ui-input-text.ui-slider-input {
[11:42:15] <toddmparker_> width: 30px;
[11:42:15] <toddmparker_> padding: .3em 0 .3em .6em;
[11:42:15] <toddmparker_> border: 0;
[11:42:15] <toddmparker_> font-weight: bold;
[11:42:16] <toddmparker_> }
[11:42:17] <uGoMobi> loads*
[11:42:33] <toddmparker_> ^^ relevant styles other than the spinner button hiding
[11:42:42] <toddmparker_> feels more integrated
[11:43:05] <toddmparker_> if that works, maybe the range will work
[11:43:05] <uGoMobi> looks good
[11:43:11] <toddmparker_> on the same line
[11:43:18] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:43:20] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15arschmitz pushed 1 new commit to 06range: 02http://git.io/fBUvGA
[11:43:20] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06range 142adfab9 15Alexander Schmitz: slider: fix incorrect variable name which caused error in firefox
[11:43:42] <arschmitz> ^^ fixes issue in firefox 
[11:43:44] <uGoMobi> yes, and the margin between input and slider can be reduced too
[11:43:46] <toddmparker_> seems to gain us 50+ pixels
[11:43:57] <toddmparker_> right, we can tighten it all up
[11:44:10] <uGoMobi> not a problem anymore if slider handle almost touches the input
[11:44:20] <toddmparker_> so my pref would be to tweak styles and just leave it on one line
[11:44:21] <uGoMobi> with this styling
[11:44:25] <toddmparker_> right
[11:44:27] <arschmitz> yeah i think that it will be good this way
[11:44:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: agreed
[11:44:31] <toddmparker_> great
[11:44:46] <toddmparker_> apply this to both the slider and range
[11:44:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: tables I have been working in that JS Bin first ... have to move copy it
[11:45:05] <toddmparker_> and skip the complexity of moving the inputs up
[11:45:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: but there are also still a couple of differences between browsers i am looking into
[11:45:18] <toddmparker_> ok uGoMobi 
[11:45:40] <toddmparker_> looking forward to styling the demos
[11:46:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: we have to see what table CSS should go into theme or structure and what should be custom CSS
[11:46:40] <uGoMobi> but i will push the demo page first
[11:47:09] <agcolom> just a quick note on the range slider... I've noticed that when you have a range, and if you click on the track, it is always the second handle that will move to that point. I would expect that the closest handle to that point would move, but this is probably a tiny detail, and I am not sure what the right thing should be... I suppose that the way it is now is consistent... (always the second hand
[11:47:09] <agcolom> le)
[11:47:50] <arschmitz> agcolom: is that on the new link because that should be fixed it used to be a problem though
[11:48:27] <agcolom> arschmitz: I get this on this link http://jquerymobile.com/branches/range/docs/demos/sliders/sliders.html
[11:48:40] <arschmitz> agcolom: what browser?
[11:48:51] <agcolom> Safari
[11:48:51] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi: https://gist.github.com/f2d316b78cb2e60c39fb
[11:49:02] <johnbender> you can search for // NOTE for all my notes
[11:49:06] <johnbender> and I added whitespace
[11:49:13] <agcolom> Safari 5.1.7
[11:49:26] <uGoMobi> johnbender: thanks
[11:49:32] <agcolom> OS X 10.6.8
[11:49:48] <arschmitz> johnbender: thank you very much
[11:49:59] <johnbender> np np
[11:50:13] <agcolom> have to go... 
[11:50:17] <toddmparker_> johnbender: thanks for the review, that's great
[11:50:24] <uGoMobi> enjoy rest of your holiday agcolom 
[11:50:35] <johnbender> toddmparker_: still need to do the review of the panel
[11:50:37] <johnbender> maybe tomorrow
[11:50:53] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[11:50:58] <toddmparker_> ok, mind doing a similiar treatment w/ notes?
[11:51:08] <toddmparker_> zachleat is working on unit tests now
[11:51:16] <arschmitz> johnbender: i didnt know about the speed difference on $.data i need to switch all those for sure lol
[11:51:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah we have a serious problem with that in buttonMarkup
[11:51:36] <johnbender> the first 20 lines of that file are brutal
[11:51:59] <Wilto> who said buttonMarkup
[11:52:09] <Wilto> johnbender: Put a dollar in the jar.
[11:52:10] <johnbender> arschmitz: make sure to add a comment so that people know not to change it
[11:52:18] <toddmparker_> Wilto is like the troll under the bridge
[11:52:22] <johnbender> :)
[11:52:29] <Wilto> In many ways. Many ways.
[11:52:43] <toddmparker_> troof
[11:52:51] <arschmitz> johnbender: will do
[11:53:13] <toddmparker_> ok so one more turn on sliders
[11:53:22] <toddmparker_> then we can get that into master
[11:53:29] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:53:33] <arschmitz> can anyone else try and reproduce the problem agcolom: is seeing i dont see it in safari?
[11:53:38] <uGoMobi> have to add some unit tests for rangeslider
[11:53:46] <toddmparker_> seems like we're simplifying so that might go smoothly
[11:53:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i started on those but havent really had time to get anywhere yet
[11:54:03] <toddmparker_> she's on an older version of safari
[11:54:10] <toddmparker_> mine is newer
[11:54:19] <arschmitz> the one i have dosent show it either
[11:54:40] <arschmitz> im also on safari on pc lol
[11:54:44] <toddmparker_> johnbender can smack me, but i think we can probably land these in master w/o tests but we need full coverage by 1.3 final
[11:54:56] <johnbender> :(
[11:55:04] <toddmparker_> sooner is better obviously
[11:55:16] <johnbender> T_T
[11:55:17] <uGoMobi> we can have this done by tomorrow
[11:55:23] <toddmparker_> no tear from johnbender so that's something
[11:55:39] <uGoMobi> the CSS is more or less a revert
[11:55:48] <arschmitz> yeah without tests i can make the changes johnbender: suggested tonight
[11:56:07] <Wilto> who said “without tests”
[11:56:08] <uGoMobi> and we don't need that many unit tests I think since rangeslider is basically two sliders
[11:56:14] <toddmparker_> sorry if i led you guys off course, didn't know the css would be so bad
[11:56:23] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: true
[11:56:25] <johnbender> you guys know the value of tests, making an issue out of it would just be make me an asshole :)
[11:56:40] <Wilto> You guys want me to tag in anywhere?
[11:56:55] <toddmparker_> let's get this all patched up and in final shape but do tests right after
[11:56:57] <Wilto> Like say on tests, just to throw an example out there.
[11:56:58] <uGoMobi> johnbender: are we testing against core 1.8.2 somewhere?
[11:56:58] <arschmitz> johnbender: ill get them for sure i started already 
[11:57:08] <Wilto> Oh, cool.
[11:57:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: 1.8.3 I believe
[11:57:28] <uGoMobi> johnbender: on FF the slider unit tests fail in branch range that uses 1.8.2
[11:57:28] <toddmparker_> i saw an issue come in on panels re: android webviews. need to look at that.
[11:57:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: i saw that one he basicly said they didnt work at all 
[11:58:47] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I will test it again on master, will paste 1.8.2 in jquery.js local
[11:58:48] <toddmparker_> yeah, odd
[11:58:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: well we don't automate firefox anyway so we wouldn't get that
[11:59:02] <toddmparker_> guessing it's the hardware accel?
[11:59:05] <johnbender> uGoMobi: but I'll go add it to the jquery-old run
[11:59:19] <uGoMobi> it was something with jQuery.event ... event undefined
[11:59:30] <arschmitz> u
[11:59:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that is fixed now
[11:59:43] <arschmitz> thats what agcolom was seeing
[12:00:02] <arschmitz> i had a varible name wrong
[12:00:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh ok
[12:00:10] <arschmitz> in slider
[12:00:17] <uGoMobi> didn't know that was the same problem
[12:00:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[12:00:33] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:00:39] <arschmitz> the varible was an event object
[12:00:50] <uGoMobi> fixed then :)
[12:01:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[12:01:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5399#issuecomment-11660474
[12:01:28] <uGoMobi> I was pretty sure you would agree so I closed that PR
[12:01:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: widget factory already has enable and disable
[12:01:58] <arschmitz> by default
[12:02:04] <arschmitz> we just need to use them correctly
[12:02:15] <uGoMobi> but we dont use that for collapsible, right?
[12:02:26] <uGoMobi> only form widgets
[12:02:36] <uGoMobi> or am i wrong?
[12:02:43] <arschmitz> all widget have it we just need to use it correctly
[12:03:05] <arschmitz> there is an open issue on it from _|Nix|_
[12:03:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you don't need to
[12:03:34] <johnbender> uGoMobi: if you run the automated tests you can have them append the jquery query string param
[12:03:44] <uGoMobi> johnbender: good point
[12:04:01] <johnbender> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/#testing
[12:04:02] <johnbender> at the bottom
[12:04:19] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah I remember now, but somehow I always forget it too ;)
[12:04:33] <johnbender> it's arcane
[12:04:35] <uGoMobi> johnbender: but arschmitz just fixed the issue that was causing the test to fail
[12:04:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5390
[12:04:47] <johnbender> parameterizing grunt tasks is/was clumsy
[12:04:56] <johnbender> cool
[12:05:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see
[12:05:59] <uGoMobi> we can use that for collapsible too yeah
[12:06:11] <uGoMobi> still better than make it an option like in that PR
[12:06:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah its all maked into widget factory already
[12:07:32] <uGoMobi> anything else we have to discuss?
[12:07:48] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: +1 for closing that PR
[12:08:15] <toddmparker_> nope, think we're good
[12:08:43] <arschmitz> cool
[12:08:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: will you be around tomorrow ?
[12:08:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[12:09:02] <arschmitz> all day
[12:09:03] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:09:04] <uGoMobi> me too
[12:09:18] <toddmparker_> i'll be travelling most of the day but i'll check in
[12:09:20] <arschmitz> cool we should be able to finish up and merge range i think
[12:09:23] <uGoMobi> we can work on unit tests together
[12:09:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds good
[12:09:49] <uGoMobi> will have the CSS ready in the morning 
[12:10:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill try and have the js done by morning too
[12:10:16] <uGoMobi> perfect
[12:10:37] <arschmitz> johnbender: if you still have a minute i have a question about the navigate event
[12:10:47] <johnbender> arschmitz: sure thing
[12:11:11] <arschmitz> so the navigate event should be fired every time the page navigates right? 
[12:11:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: sort of
[12:11:28] <johnbender> arschmitz: but yes
[12:11:46] <johnbender> arschmitz: that might not always be the case with jqm
[12:11:50] <johnbender> outside of jqm
[12:11:51] <johnbender> yes
[12:12:12] <arschmitz> ok if its pulling in a page via ajax would that fire navigate?
[12:12:19] <johnbender> no
[12:12:22] <arschmitz> ok
[12:12:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: changing the url is a navigate event
[12:12:33] <johnbender> it's entirely url centric
[12:12:47] <johnbender> think back and forward buttons
[12:12:47] <arschmitz> so it only fired when a page is loaded via http?
[12:12:53] <johnbender> nope
[12:13:10] <johnbender> pushState, popState, and hash changes will fire navigate
[12:13:11] <johnbender> err
[12:13:21] <johnbender> pushState, replaceState and hash assignments
[12:13:53] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[12:13:53] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #216: FIXED in 12 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/216/
[12:14:14] <arschmitz> but doesnt loading a page via ajax cause a replaceState?
[12:14:19] <johnbender> we had a pull and a grep for the git version which was broken because the jquery-git header changed
[12:14:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: no
[12:14:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: do you mean via $.ajax
[12:14:36] <johnbender> or via changePage
[12:14:43] <arschmitz> johnbender: changePAge
[12:14:44] <arschmitz> sorry
[12:15:02] <arschmitz> like clicking any normal link in a JQM page
[12:15:09] <johnbender> arschmitz: yes, but in JQM if we triggered a navigate after navigating we'd end up in an infinite loop
[12:15:24] <johnbender> arschmitz: that's why changePage calls $.navigate with false as the third argument
[12:15:28] <johnbender> it prevents the events
[12:15:44] <arschmitz> ok
[12:15:47] <johnbender> there's no choice
[12:15:55] <johnbender> we have to maintain backward compat
[12:16:09] <johnbender> arschmitz: at some point I'd like to remove the direct calls to changePage in the link/form submissions
[12:16:18] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah makes sense i had just misunderstood when it should fire
[12:16:21] <johnbender> the link/form hijacking should call $.navigate
[12:16:26] <johnbender> arschmitz: not your fault
[12:16:28] <johnbender> it's confusing
[12:16:34] <johnbender> you have the right idea
[12:16:44] <johnbender> what you're describing is the way it _should_ work
[12:16:51] <arschmitz> i was setting up an event demo and added navigate and it was only fireing on the inital page load
[12:17:01] <johnbender> and when I write the docs I'll explain that people should bind to navigate when using it with jqm
[12:17:09] <arschmitz> and that didnt *seem right
[12:17:15] <johnbender> *shouldn't
[12:17:21] <johnbender> arschmitz: and you are correct
[12:17:51] <johnbender> arschmitz: we might tackle that next release
[12:18:03] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok cool i just wanted to make sure it was working the way it should
[12:18:14] <johnbender> the difficulty will be maintaining backward compat with changePage
[12:18:16] <arschmitz> well as you intended anyway
[12:18:21] <johnbender> because people call that expecting the url to be altered
[12:18:24] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah
[12:18:27] <johnbender> it's working as intended
[12:18:37] <johnbender> lol, confusing and crazy == intended
[12:18:39] <johnbender> :/
[12:19:12] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah enough is changing in 1.4 though that if you dont like the way it is and want to change it it might be a good time to do it
[12:19:19] <johnbender> yep
[12:19:24] <johnbender> the tests have proven their worth so far too
[12:19:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: has started lobbying for calling it 2.0 lol 
[12:19:32] <johnbender> no one has reported any issues in work on master
[12:19:39] <johnbender> though obviously people are working in branches
[12:19:56] <johnbender> lol
[12:20:01] <johnbender> arschmitz: we might need to split it up
[12:20:03] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah iv been working on a project on master because its going to be on 1.3 and i havent noticed anything
[12:20:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do the refactoring in 1.4 and then perf in 1.5
[12:20:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool
[12:20:35] <johnbender> the work satisfies a _lot_ of tests
[12:20:39] <johnbender> so I'm hopeful
[12:21:04] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah it seems really good so far nicely done!
[12:21:14] <johnbender> arschmitz: I'm pretty confident that the rest of nav can be moved into $.contentContainer
[12:21:19] <toddmparker_> cool stuff
[12:21:23] <arschmitz> i was looking at the code and i like the general simplicity of it too
[12:21:29] <johnbender> arschmitz: "simplicity"
[12:21:31] <toddmparker_> just need to explain it now and do some demos
[12:21:38] <johnbender> where the crazyness of nav is taken into account
[12:21:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah as simple as can be lol
[12:22:00] <johnbender> err a $.fn.contentContainer widget
[12:22:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: the hash managment and url squashing is complete bullshit
[12:22:29] <johnbender> it's totall stacked together to get it to work
[12:22:43] <johnbender> but at least it's confined to two methods that can be tested
[12:22:44] <arschmitz> yeah you had mentioned that before
[12:23:01] <arschmitz> but its your first pass at it
[12:23:06] <johnbender> isolate and confine the disease
[12:23:06] <johnbender> yah
[12:23:07] <arschmitz> im sure it will get better
[12:23:15] <johnbender> hopefully we'll have time to revisit it
[12:23:32] <johnbender> other more important stuff coming up though me thinks
[12:23:49] <arschmitz> even if its not untill a later version 
[12:24:08] <arschmitz> its quarentined an not causeing any issues so far
[12:27:39] <arschmitz> johnbender: wow $.data() is crazy faster!
[12:27:58] <arschmitz> 61% faster 
[12:29:16] <arschmitz> dramaticly more then that in older browswers damn
[12:30:02] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[12:30:02] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom 1.2-stable build #30: FIXED in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%201.2-stable/30/
[12:38:27] <johnbender> arschmitz: :)
[12:38:34] <johnbender> uGoMobi: Wilto: toddmparker_: ^^^
[12:38:45] <arschmitz> http://jsperf.com/jquery-data-vs-jqueryselection-data
[12:38:51] <arschmitz> the difference is amazing
[12:39:11] <toddmparker_> impressive
[12:39:12] <johnbender> the event subsystem is complex
[12:39:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: uGoMobi: Wilto: keep that in mind when writing code
[12:39:36] <toddmparker_> if this is so much faster, seems worth changing buttonmarkup if we can for 1.3 if it's a quick fix
[12:39:42] <Wilto> I thought we did a sweep for $.data(), at one point?
[12:39:45] <Wilto> Like, in everything.
[12:39:59] <johnbender> Wilto: we did
[12:40:23] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L249
[12:40:39] <Wilto> Huh.
[12:40:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: uGoMobi: arschmitz https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js#L25
[12:41:00] <Wilto> Ohh, right.
[12:41:09] <johnbender> $.fn.jqmData uses $.fn.data
[12:41:19] <Wilto> So we sorted it on individual calls at one stage, but not in jqmData.
[12:41:35] <johnbender> and that button mark up stuff makes something like 10 calls
[12:41:37] <arschmitz> yeah seems like we should change this
[12:41:40] <johnbender> and buttonMarkup is _everywhere_
[12:41:44] <Wilto> I’m not gonna jinx it by saying something like “that looks like an easy win,” but… Yeah.
[12:41:46] <johnbender> I had a branch that did
[12:41:50] <johnbender> never got around to merging it
[12:42:05] <toddmparker_> might be worth resurrecting that branch
[12:42:07] <johnbender> arschmitz: the problem with changing it is we have no way of tracking regressions
[12:42:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's a quick fix
[12:42:20] <johnbender> I was monkeying around with other things too
[12:42:21] <toddmparker_> does seem like low hanging fruit since it's used so extensively
[12:42:25] <toddmparker_> FIX IT
[12:42:25] <arschmitz> ill try making the change and run the full test suit and see if anything breaks 
[12:42:51] <johnbender> I would really love to make testing perf stupid easy for everyone on the project
[12:42:58] <johnbender> the problem is recording the data
[12:43:03] <johnbender> and then comparing it across runs
[12:43:04] <Wilto> Yeah.
[12:43:16] <johnbender> 2 std deviations is probably enough to send out an alert
[12:43:26] <Wilto> WARNING: MATH TERMS
[12:43:27] <johnbender> but we have to get that info together
[12:43:35] <arschmitz> johnbender: that would be awesome
[12:43:41] <johnbender> yah it would be
[12:44:06] <johnbender> we know the folks who built jsperf and he made it sound like it would be easy to just use jsperf.com
[12:44:16] <johnbender> but I'm not at all clear about how that would work across versions
[12:44:30] <johnbender> we'd have to have a crazy noconflict method
[12:44:46] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah sounds like that could get complicated
[12:44:50] <Wilto> Can’t we just make performance numbers up? Squint real hard at the page as it loads, maybe use a stopwatch app.
[12:44:57] <Wilto> I’m helping.
[12:45:24] <arschmitz> Wilto: the key is to have the same person do it each time. since you want to help i think your perfect
[12:45:32] <arschmitz> that way it removes reaction time
[12:45:39] <Wilto> I like the way you think.
[12:46:04] <arschmitz> we will have jsWilto to track our performance
[12:46:51] <arschmitz> jsWilto = Wilto with an old mechanical stopwatch 
[12:48:17] <Wilto> Returning valuable metrics like “fast-ish.” “Pretty okay.” “Eh.”
[12:49:53] <arschmitz> just need to run a few times to establish a baseline 
[12:50:14] <arschmitz> then if performance goes down we will hear you scream 
[12:50:23] <Wilto> “AW WHAT THE HELL GUYS”
[12:50:46] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[13:03:57] <toddmparker_> beers are already purchased
[13:04:06] <toddmparker_> safe travels.
[13:29:37] <Wilto> who said beer
