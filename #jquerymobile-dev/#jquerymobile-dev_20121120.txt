[00:30:40] <uGoMobi> ?tell arschmitz: Yes, I was indeed wondering about 500 vs. 1025px. Noticed it when I wanted to cherry-pick your fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4724
[00:30:41] <bot-t> uGoMobi, Okay.
[01:12:55] <_|Nix|_> I think Android 4.1 ignores preventDefault ... I mean, I open a popup, and I click on the textfield behind it, and the popup closes, and the textfield gets focus.
[01:13:27] <_|Nix|_> I mean, when you click on the screen behind the popup, it closes the popup and it prevents default! Yet somehow the event makes it to the textfield ...
[01:13:55] <_|Nix|_> Like, WTF?!
[01:15:36] <_|Nix|_> OK, I give up ... HTF do you preventDefault() on Android 4.1?
[01:22:47] <_|Nix|_> OK ... this is the same on Android 2.3.5 ...
[01:23:17] <_|Nix|_> If you click on a text field behind a popup, the text field gets the focus even though the popup's screen is supposed to eat the event.
[01:27:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: morning!
[01:27:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sounds familiar... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3912
[02:01:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, I think I have a solution.
[02:01:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that sounds good :)
[02:01:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have observed that the mouse event problem does not occur with normal popups - only custom selects.
[02:01:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is it caused by something in the CSS?
[02:02:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I think it's because normal popup opening goes through nav.
[02:02:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: the popup doesn't open on click, or vclick, or anything.
[02:02:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It opens on pagebeforechange.
[02:02:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: By the time pagebeforechange happens, the storm of mouse events has passed.
[02:03:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... so there are no mouse events left to cause havoc.
[02:03:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I'm going to try passing the dialog xor popup of the custom select through navigation.
[02:03:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Basically, I'm going to assign the jQuery object that is the popup/dialog to the link.
[02:03:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Kind of like href=<jQuery object>
[02:04:09] <_|Nix|_> Except I'm not going to assign it to the href attribute, because that's impossible.
[02:04:49] <_|Nix|_> ... although it might be easiest, because the nav is set up to handle hrefs.
[02:05:08] <_|Nix|_> ... but then I have to construct unique hrefs for each custom select popup/dialog.
[02:06:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sounds like a good solution, but not an easy one
[02:06:12] <_|Nix|_> I believe each widget instance has a unique ID, so I can use that to build hrefs.
[02:06:19] <_|Nix|_> Nope. It is not easy at all.
[02:08:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Yes 1025 was intentional its to address an issue on iOS with position:fixed while keyboard is opens
[02:08:41] <bot-t> (1 hour 38 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell arschmitz: Yes, I was indeed wondering about 500 vs. 1025px. Noticed it when I wanted to cherry-pick your fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4724
[02:09:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Go back to bed. You're dreaming!
[02:09:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: After group discussion it was decided to just hide toolbars on anything iPad or smaller 
[02:10:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is this compatible with johnbender his work nav?
[02:10:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If I use hrefs, yes.

[02:11:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, thanks

[02:14:09] <uGoMobi> but it was late so maybe I missed something
[02:21:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you see my comments on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5254 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5275 ?
[02:21:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the custom select popup needs an ID
[02:21:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was thinking, if you are looking in custom selects anyway... :)

[02:22:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, it's gonna have an ID out of necessity now.
[02:22:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I am going to change the custom select menu open() method to simply click on the button.
[02:23:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The custom select dialog will also have an ID.
[02:23:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In fact, if the select menu has an ID, I'm going to prefix the dialog and popup IDs with the select's ID just to make it understood that they belong together.
[02:23:57] <uGoMobi> great
[02:24:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, each widget has this.uuid from the widget factory!
[02:24:23] <_|Nix|_> That's awesome!

[03:29:01] <agcolom> Hi! 
[03:29:28] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Thx for the api entry ;-) 
[03:30:24] <agcolom> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_ just to let you know that we no longer have to add examples by hand for widget events, options and methods. It's all done via the XSLT unless we want non standard ones.
[03:31:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok cool
[03:36:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so custom selectmenu popups and dialog will always have Ids. If the selectmenu has an ID, then it's <id>-popup and <id>-dialog, otherwise it's $.mobile.ns + "uuid-" + widget.uuid + "-popup" ...
[03:37:40] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15skozyr opened issue #5308: CSS class is not copied from <select> tag to a button element  02http://git.io/TCAZ6A

[03:38:32] <_|Nix|_> Bam!
[03:38:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that is the same as we do for regular popups, right?
[03:39:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good point ...
[03:39:33] <uGoMobi> or was it popup-<id> ?
[03:39:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The popup container is actually gonna have -popup-popup :)
[03:39:55] <uGoMobi> aii
[03:40:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but that should only matter if you want to access the popup's container.
[03:41:17] <uGoMobi> looks a bit sloppy though
[03:41:52] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[03:41:53] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Old build #82: FIXED in 1 hr 19 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/82/
[03:42:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suppose I could call it -list or something, and then we'd have -list-popup
[03:43:08] <_|Nix|_> I called it -listbox, because the variable that holds it is called listbox anyway.
[03:44:38] <_|Nix|_> So, <id>-listbox is the element that has the popup widget instantiated on it <id>-listbox-popup is the popup container.
[03:45:30] <_|Nix|_> And, BTW, this seems to fix both the blue flash and the highlighting of list items on Android.
[03:45:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if I look at how we do it for popup <id>-selectmenu seems most consistent
[03:46:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am really impressed how you nailed this down
[03:51:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Don't be impressed just yet. So far it only WORKSFORME. Be impressed when this turns out to be the solution :)
[03:51:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I'll put it in the fridge
[03:51:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The thing with <id>-selectmenu is that there are two variants: the dialog, and the popup. Both cannot have <id>-selectmenu
[03:52:06] <_|Nix|_> LOL :)
[03:53:04] <uGoMobi> hmm
[03:54:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's why I went with <id>-listbox and <id>-dialog
[03:55:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Presumable, people will choose an <id> that reflects the purpose of the widget.
[03:55:15] <uGoMobi> looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5254 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5275 I think this could be a problem
[03:55:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Why's that?
[03:55:42] <uGoMobi> when you dynamically add options to the select
[03:56:03] <uGoMobi> well you could add both id's to the selector
[03:57:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you dynamically add options to the select you should add <option> entries to the <select> and refresh() true.
[03:57:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You shouldn't touch the UL.
[03:57:28] <uGoMobi> yes, I just mean... you don't know if it's going to be a popup or dialog
[03:57:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good. That's the point.
[03:58:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you need to control what it's going to be, perhaps you should be using a popup and a dialog, not a selectmenu.
[03:58:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you do want to use a selectmenu and you want to make custom mods to the dialog and/or the popup, you have to make mods to both.
[03:59:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you want to access the UL, there's an ID for that: <id>-menu ...
[03:59:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's the same UL that will be present in both the dialog and the popup.
[04:00:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe we should document all these IDs.
[04:00:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We have popupID, dialogID, buttonId, and menuID.
[04:00:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's quite a collection ...
[04:02:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I had another look at those issues and I think it's ok if popup and dialog selectmenu's get two different ID's
[04:02:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[04:03:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We still need to fix the refresh() for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5275 ...
[04:03:33] <uGoMobi> in most cases people just need to be able to target the selectmenu popup, not the dialog
[04:03:49] <uGoMobi> for the chaining setTimeout workaround for example
[04:03:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do you mean the popup or the popup's container?
[04:04:12] <uGoMobi> the popup, to bind to popup events
[04:04:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, you mean the popup, because they wanna catch popupafterclose ...
[04:04:18] <_|Nix|_> Got it.
[04:04:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's bad though, because popupafterclose may never happen, if the selectmenu decides that it should use the dialog.
[04:05:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but you are right that we have to document the generated ID's for custom selects
[04:05:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... they don't actually need the ID.
[04:05:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They can just use $.mobile.popup.active ...
[04:06:06] <_|Nix|_> $.mobile.popup.active.element.one( "popupafterclose", function() { ... } );
[04:06:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, if they want to do popup chaining, that's exactly what they should do.
[04:07:25] <_|Nix|_> if ( $.mobile.popup.active ) { $.mobile.popup.active.element.one( "popupafterclose", openThePopup ); } else { openThePopup(); }
[04:08:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In fact, come to think of it, we should document this approach, and then people can do popup chaining for themselves, and we don't have to.
[04:08:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course, before we document, we should probably make sure it works :)
[04:08:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but if you want to do something after a selectmenu popup has been closed, but not when a regular popup on the same popup has been closed... how do you code that?
[04:08:42] <uGoMobi> lol @ probably
[04:09:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you want to show any popup whatsoever, you should probably show it with the above code.
[04:09:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now, you can run the above code at .bind( "change", function() { /* run code here */ } ) ...
[04:09:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In a way, that gives us popup chaining, but I'm not sure we'd want to fully support that in the framework.
[04:10:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  if ( $.mobile.popup.active ) { $.mobile.popup.active.element.one( "popupafterclose", openThePopup ); } else { openThePopup(); } <<< doesn't this require a setTimeout to work?
[04:10:32] <_|Nix|_> Why would it?
[04:10:51] <_|Nix|_> I believe popupafterclose is fired after $.mobile.popup.active is unset.
[04:11:15] <_|Nix|_> If I'm wrong, then yes, it requires an unwind - let's not call it a setTimeout, to save johnbender some jitters.
[04:11:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see last paragraph http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[04:12:17] <uGoMobi> haha... we need a codename for setTimeout
[04:12:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: YOu might not actually need the , 100
[04:12:37] * _|Nix|_ checks the code.
[04:13:00] <_|Nix|_> Actually, you don't need the timeout at all.
[04:13:18] * uGoMobi is surprised
[04:13:21] <_|Nix|_> The code looks like this: $.mobile.popup.active = null; this._trigger( "afterclose" );
[04:13:51] <_|Nix|_> Though you're probably better off with a timeout.
[04:14:04] <_|Nix|_> ... because otherwise you're kinda recursing.
[04:14:22] <_|Nix|_> You're doing the open of the next popup from the close of the first popup.
[04:14:42] <_|Nix|_> ... but I'm almost 100% sure you don't need a real timeout, just an unwind.
[04:14:56] <uGoMobi> ok
[04:15:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's make a chaining demo.
[04:15:26] <_|Nix|_> I'll wait for the unit test run to complete on this custom select thing, then I'll fire up a jsbin.
[04:15:35] <uGoMobi> I think I remember someone reporting it didn't work with 50ms, but not sure
[04:15:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  ok great idea
[04:16:48] <uGoMobi> this is the JS Bin test page where having an id to target the select popup would be helpful http://jsbin.com/ikudom/2/edit
[04:17:42] <_|Nix|_> I see it.
[04:18:29] <_|Nix|_> That would be $( "#<id>-listbox" ).bind( "popupafterclose", ... ) when I'm done.
[04:19:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does this fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5354 once pushed?
[04:19:29] <_|Nix|_> Sorry, I meant https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5254
[04:20:00] <_|Nix|_> Sounds like it would.
[04:20:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[04:20:33] <_|Nix|_> So, I guess that means it would fix blue-flash, random-highlight, and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5254
[04:20:42] <_|Nix|_> Hut diggety!
[04:20:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it doesn't fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5275 but it would offer a workaround
[04:21:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. We need to make sure .refresh() works correctly.
[04:21:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, weird that a forced rebuild doesn't rebuild the header
[04:21:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Indeed ...
[04:22:15] <uGoMobi> didn't investigate it any further yet
[04:22:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think it's because the placeholder element is stored in the widget's member variables ...
[04:22:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and once a placeholder has been found, it is no longer sought, even upon rebuild ...
[04:23:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, unit tests have passed, so here I go, breaking custom select menus ...
[04:23:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, my first thought was also that something is stored and needs to be destroyed first
[04:23:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We do way too many things statically.
[04:24:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, I noticed when we worked on css-corner-styling
[04:24:53] <uGoMobi> things are set when a widget is created

[04:29:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Give master a shot though - I haven't been able to reproduce the problem since I started running the popup and the dialog through nav.
[04:29:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Thanks! Will do.
[04:29:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I set milestone on 1.2.1 ... think we can cherry-pick this?
[04:30:10] <uGoMobi> otherwise we change it to 1.3
[04:30:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I'll test latest
[04:31:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno ... 
[04:33:41] <_|Nix|_> I am cherrypicking another one though ... a null-check in nav ...
[04:35:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm... there is a queue http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/ :(
[04:36:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we gotta wait for core to finish, eh?
[04:36:34] <uGoMobi> it's UI actually
[04:36:40] <_|Nix|_> Oh, right.
[04:36:50] <_|Nix|_> That's alright ... gives me time to run the unit tests on 1.2-stable for that nav null-check.
[04:37:10] <_|Nix|_> That might actually be worth pulling all the way back to 1.1-stable ...
[04:38:30] <uGoMobi> 1.1-stable? popup?
[04:40:27] <_|Nix|_> Nono. A nav null-check from a PR.
[04:40:55] <_|Nix|_> hashchange was dying if a page accessed earlier was added to urlHistory without having a data-url.
[04:41:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh sorry, thought you were talking about the fix you just pushed
[04:41:39] <_|Nix|_> It was doing active.url.indexOf( dialogHashKey ) without first checking if active.url was even set.
[04:42:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, I'm totally not sure whether we should push that up to 1.2 ... but maybe we should, because it's ugly on Android.

[05:04:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We're still above freezing here.
[05:05:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's in the 40s here.
[05:05:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its still above durring the the day but not at night
[05:05:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aaah ... good point.
[05:06:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its going to be in the 40's today here also
[05:06:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I also had a slight bit of frost on my car last night around 18:00 when I left work.
[05:06:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: iv had to scrape my car every morning for the last week
[05:07:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Europe's got it relatively easy, even up here in Scandinavia. The Gulf stream brings lots of heat our way.
[05:08:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah the gulf stream goes well south of maine where i am. 
[05:09:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In Canada it was all about the jetstream. North of it - bitter cold, south of it - comfortably warm.
[05:11:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah im right on the border of newbrunswick and quebec
[05:13:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: our idea for a widget review ticket
[05:13:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right ...
[05:14:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: talked to johnbende yesterday and he thought it was a good idea
[05:14:15] <arschmitz> espically _destroy
[05:14:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I saw that discussion. Let's do it.
[05:15:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sounds good iv been going through a few tickets and already found a bunch that updateing these will fix
[05:15:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Found a bug. The multiple select state list sometimes shows a popup with only the header and no list.
[05:15:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... on Android 2.3.5 ...
[05:15:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good! Link to them from the new ticket.
[05:16:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sounds good. Ill create the ticket so i can edit it lol 
[05:17:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: id say we should probably close the issues for _on and _destroy since this will encompass those ?
[05:20:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Link them. Let's close them together.
[05:22:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you mean leave them open and link them then just close them when we eventually close the new issue?
[05:25:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think so, though if toddmparker or uGoMobi think we should close them after we've linked them, I have no objection either.
[05:25:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: state list? you mean the long list... popup = dialog?
[05:26:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, the multiple select state list.
[05:27:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is this with or without the fix you just pushed?
[05:28:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: With the fix.
[05:28:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's a regression.
[05:28:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Looking at it.
[05:30:37] <_|Nix|_> Weird ... it only happens on Android.
[05:30:44] <_|Nix|_> So, it's another event thing.
[05:38:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can I attach developer tools to the native browser on Android 2.3.5?
[05:38:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have it connected over USB to my laptop.
[05:39:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do I need some kind of plugin? I thought you said something like that ...
[05:39:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://developers.google.com/chrome/mobile/docs/debugging
[05:39:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can only use it for Chrome browser, not the native browser
[05:40:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Gah! No use then.
[05:40:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Back to my trusty console.php ...
[05:41:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I am afraid so
[05:45:26] <arschmitz> with ios 6 you can connect to safari dev tools but only on a mac :(
[05:45:46] <_|Nix|_> F0rking great! Sometimes you get two vclicks in quick succession ...
[05:46:32] <_|Nix|_> Fortunately we already have a self.isOpen which we set to true immediately.
[05:52:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Fixed, I think.
[05:57:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hah! If all goes well, the fix involved the removal of 4 lines :)
[05:58:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: those are the best fixes
[05:59:21] <_|Nix|_> I know, eh?
[06:10:49] <toddmparker> good morning
[06:12:35] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[06:13:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: What do you think: should we cherry-pick the close button option to 1.2-stable?
[06:14:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Strictly speaking, it's a new feature, but lots of people are wanting it - as evidenced by two PRs seeking to customize the dialog's close button - PRs we just finished closing.
[06:15:33] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker:
[06:16:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think we should cherry-pick new options
[06:16:29] <uGoMobi> sorry, you were not asking me ;-)
[06:16:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's fine. Your opinion matters just as much.
[06:16:59] <uGoMobi> if you do that once...
[06:17:08] <_|Nix|_> I guess ...
[06:18:41] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi - awesome work on that popup stuff. impressive.
[06:19:35] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: I know that close button is a feature people want, but since we're following semver, we really need to stick to the rule of not changing the api or adding features for maintenance releases.
[06:19:48] <toddmparker> i'd rather hustle and get 1.3 out faster
[06:19:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: thanks, but it is mostly _|Nix|_
[06:20:18] <toddmparker> having another person to work with makes a big difference uGoMobi 
[06:20:29] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/YwEflw
[06:20:30] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14ef88caf 15Gabriel Schulhof: [custom select menu] Make sure the UL ends up inside the popup when the menu is closed so that the next time its size needs to be measured to decide whether to show a dialog or a popup its size /can/ be measured. Also, centralize the close behaviour in the close method.
[06:20:31] <uGoMobi> yeah that's true
[06:20:34] <toddmparker> 80% of props go to _|Nix|_ - how's that?
[06:20:54] <_|Nix|_> It's not over just yet ...
[06:20:59] <uGoMobi> haha
[06:21:03] <toddmparker> if we can try to pick items off the 1.3 issue list, we can get that much closer to a beta
[06:22:08] <_|Nix|_> OK. Let's hope that fixes the regression, and that I haven't unwittingly exploded anything.
[06:22:15] * _|Nix|_ BBIAB
[06:23:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it would be nice if UI wouldn't do all those builds at once
[06:23:57] <uGoMobi> we are waiting for 2 hours already :S
[06:23:59] <uGoMobi> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/
[06:24:01] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: I can help add some docs and demos for you
[06:24:26] <toddmparker> looks like we need to add the click out to close popup option and demo - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4727
[06:25:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I'll add info/demos for..
[06:25:43] <uGoMobi> collapsible and collapsible set: corners (inset only)
[06:25:44] <uGoMobi> listviews: corners + shadow (inset only)
[06:25:44] <uGoMobi> dialog: corners
[06:25:55] <uGoMobi> ... to the docs
[06:26:02] <uGoMobi> so I can do dialog close button as well
[06:26:41] <uGoMobi> this isn't documented yet...
[06:26:41] <uGoMobi> 1.3 Controlgroup widget
[06:26:41] <uGoMobi> 1.2 Listview listviewbeforefilter event
[06:26:41] <uGoMobi> 1.3 Listview filter reveal
[06:26:41] <uGoMobi> 1.3 Popup dismissable
[06:29:56] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: that is awesome, thanks.
[06:30:03] <toddmparker> i'm here to help if you need me
[06:30:09] <toddmparker> be great to close those out
[06:30:38] <toddmparker> we need to remember to email agcolom to tell her what changed so she can port into the api docs
[06:31:01] <uGoMobi> I informed here about the new options 
[06:31:09] <uGoMobi> s/here/her/
[06:32:08] <uGoMobi> but maybe agcolom isn't informed yet about the last four that I mentioned ^^
[06:32:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: _|Nix|_ : what Symbian test devices do we have?
[06:33:32] <uGoMobi> I want to fix this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5005#issuecomment-8931219 but no response from the issue reporter anymore
[06:33:40] <uGoMobi> related: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5309
[06:33:44] <toddmparker> I have 2 s60 devices - anna and belle
[06:34:03] <uGoMobi> sounds like a sweet couple :)
[06:34:22] <toddmparker> the symbian naming is odd
[06:34:34] <uGoMobi> odd and confusing
[06:34:40] <toddmparker> indeed
[06:35:01] <uGoMobi> just want to see if we need to degrade any Symbian version
[06:35:09] <uGoMobi> if so, we can do it in 1.3
[06:35:20] <toddmparker> good thinking
[06:35:26] <toddmparker> saw that issue come in
[06:37:06] <uGoMobi> it's about series 40... should be C-grade but not a blank page
[06:42:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: do you agree that the clear button shouldn't be optional for the search input
[06:42:52] <uGoMobi> ?
[06:43:08] <uGoMobi> I thin it's part of the feature and should always be there
[06:43:21] <uGoMobi> *think
[06:59:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ^^+1 thats half the reason for search vs text also part of html spec 
[07:02:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I agree
[07:02:39] <uGoMobi> code that makes it optional came with the PR, but I just removed it
[07:17:00] <toddmparker> JasonDScott: where is the latest version of your red panels?
[07:19:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : is there anything wrong with this *as basic as possible* support test page: http://jsbin.com/uwaxaj/43/edit ?
[07:20:31] <uGoMobi> if I test IE6 on browserstack I get grade A true
[07:27:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think our grade a test is not working
[07:28:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am afraid so
[07:28:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: still IE6 does get C grade experience
[07:29:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it's not really about IE6 though, but that's the only C grade browser I could test... the problem is with Symbian series 40
[07:36:10] <toddmparker> yikes
[07:36:22] <toddmparker> but ie6 shouldn't be a
[07:37:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/uwaxaj/51/edit
[07:38:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks, I'll test that one
[07:38:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ^^properly ranks ie6
[07:38:51] <uGoMobi> so IE6 doesn't understand !! 
[07:41:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its because gradeA is a function ajaxblacklist and others arnt
[07:42:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, thanks
[07:42:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: more accuratly a varible set equal to a function
[07:42:43] <toddmparker> now that we have unit tests for tables, any issue with landing in master for refinement/testing?
[07:44:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I have been working on the CSS for tables, but I can make the changes on master, so no objections
[07:45:03] <toddmparker> ok, cool
[07:45:06] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: want to discuss with you what we want to include in framework and what we only want to demonstrate
[07:46:08] <uGoMobi> like the table-stripe class, I don't think that's something for in the structure CSS
[07:59:06] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: that's totally up for debate, sure
[07:59:31] <toddmparker> in the last rev, the strokes on cells we baked into the table styles so this at least pulls them into a class
[08:00:12] <toddmparker> table stripe isn't super useful esp. with the reflow examples so i'd be ok with just having a demo for that
[08:00:28] <toddmparker> stroke class seems useful in structure
[08:06:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: after tables has been merged in master I will create a branch that includes a demo page showing different styles
[08:06:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: makes it easier to decide what we want to include
[08:16:10] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great
[08:16:22] <toddmparker> i want to move some of the table demos into the demo folder too
[08:16:30] <toddmparker> just keep the index and api pages for each type
[08:17:20] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I'll create the demo page in the /demos/ folder

[08:39:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was about to ping you
[08:39:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: YOU FIXED IT!
[08:39:41] <uGoMobi> :D
[08:39:50] <_|Nix|_> Oh good ... *wipe forehead*
[08:40:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... then I'd like to remove a fix that johnbender pushed earlier which /seemed/ to fix the flashing issue ...
[08:41:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure
[08:41:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: want me to test first?
[08:41:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You mean, before I remove the fix?
[08:42:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[08:42:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I thought you had tested, since you said that I fixed it.
[08:43:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But yeah, sure, please, test away ... I'll wait.
[08:43:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, sorry... I meant do you want me to test removal of johnbender his previous fix
[08:43:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I did test your fix and it works
[08:43:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "yeah, sure, please, test away" :)
[08:44:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's an extremely small change, so I should have it in master in no time.
[08:44:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, then just push the change
[08:44:47] <uGoMobi> I'll test again after
[08:45:35] <uGoMobi> thought you weren'r sure because it was like you asked permission to remove it :)
[08:46:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono. I would like to remove it because I suspect it's superfluous.
[08:46:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: johnbender placed the emission of "popupafteropen" into a setTimeout to unwind the stack before it gets emitted. He said that doing so prevents the blue flash.
[08:46:59] <uGoMobi> yeah I know, the one I had to change to 400ms
[08:47:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[08:47:26] <uGoMobi> but I am sure you make johnbender happy with removing a setTimeout
[08:47:30] <uGoMobi> :D
[08:47:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, I suspect the real reason there was a blue flash was that the mouseup was being sent to some widget behind the popup, and the popup's focus-capture logic was kicking in.
[08:48:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH the unwind might be warranted.
[08:48:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So lessee ...
[08:50:31] <toddmparker> ok, i'm back. what did i miss?
[08:50:58] <toddmparker> jlembeck and scott are working on landing the table stuff now

[08:55:23] <_|Nix|_> Bam!
[08:55:52] <uGoMobi> toddmparker scottjehl jlembeck : Nice!
[08:57:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Media query unit tests are failing ... maybe https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5233?
[08:57:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ( the media query refactor )
[09:03:16] <_|Nix|_> Interesting ... on Android 2.3.5, when a popup is open and you can see a button that opens another popup behind it, sometimes, when you try to click the other button, the currently open popup is dismissed, and the other popup opens. Inadvertent popup chaining, anyone?
[09:04:20] <_|Nix|_> I think it's because I close the popup when a "vclick" happens on the screen, and I don't trap the click, mouseup, touchend and all those other events, so those are making it through to the other button, causing a click on the other popup.
[09:05:00] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: shoot. I asked scottjehl to give it a look right now
[09:05:16] <_|Nix|_> What we don't have is an event that represents "the last event that happens when the user has finished lifting her finger off the screen".
[09:05:34] <_|Nix|_> So, if we eat the second last event, we still let the last one through.
[09:05:44] <toddmparker> I'm not sure that the sequence of events is always consistent across platforms
[09:06:08] <toddmparker> what if you just used click to dismiss instead of vclick?
[09:06:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I only want the last event to be consistent. I don't care about the cavalcade of events that precedes it.
[09:06:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... but I know I'm not gonna get what I want.
[09:06:46] <toddmparker> think the problem is knowing when in the cavalcade is last
[09:06:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's gonna result in a 200 ms delay on iOS.
[09:07:04] <toddmparker> 300, i think
[09:07:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Exactly. That is the problem.
[09:07:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Either way, it's gonna look sluggish.
[09:07:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, I need to react to vclick, but I also need to eat the tail end of the cavalcade.
[09:07:41] <toddmparker> the issue with using click is if the screen elements move based on a tap, the targets won't line up
[09:08:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The screen covers the whole document, so there is only one target. The screen.
[09:08:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and the screen should eat all events.
[09:08:41] <toddmparker> so when you tap out to close the popup, the touch event bubbles up 
[09:09:01] <toddmparker> but then on android, the click event bubbles up and the target isn't the overlay anymore, it's the button
[09:09:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah. The vclick event is eaten, but the subsequent mouseup (on Android) makes it through.
[09:09:12] <toddmparker> right
[09:09:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and that's what was causing the blue flash as well.
[09:09:45] <toddmparker> that is why we've had to not use vclick in an situation where things move around - collapsibles, navigation, etc.
[09:10:17] <toddmparker> happens on iOS too I believe. Or it used to on earlier versions. 
[09:10:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK ... I can try to move to click ...
[09:10:26] <toddmparker> it sucks, i agree
[09:10:31] <toddmparker> makes everything slower
[09:10:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: In a way, it's the price you pay for having a touchscreen ...
[09:11:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The same interface is used for panning as for clicking.
[09:11:13] <toddmparker> what we might want to do is do a lot of new testing and find out where vclick is problematic and think about routing to click as a fallback there
[09:11:21] <toddmparker> on better browsers, use the touch event
[09:11:50] <toddmparker> kinblas and johnbender are very familiar with the bugginess. worth picking their brains.
[09:14:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Gah! Things are still getting through because the fixed toolbar on docs/pages/popup/index.html is going on and off as I dismiss the popup.
[09:15:01] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, whenever I dismiss a popup, the fixed toolbar toggles between position: fixed and position: static;
[09:15:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, moving to click is not the answer.
[09:15:20] <kinblas> _|Nix|_ by default vclick does not prevent the 'click' event
[09:15:31] <kinblas> you have to return false or prevent default on the vclick to cancel it
[09:15:55] <_|Nix|_> kinblas: I do all of the above: preventDefault(), stopImmediatePropagation(), and return false.
[09:16:10] <kinblas> _|Nix|_: in the vclick handler?
[09:16:19] <_|Nix|_> kinblas: ... and now in the click handler.
[09:16:31] <kinblas> this is android right?
[09:16:41] <_|Nix|_> kinblas: I've replaced vclick with click, and events are still getting through to the document.
[09:16:55] <_|Nix|_> kinblas: 2.3.5 ... may its days be numbered ...
[09:17:09] * kinblas shudders
[09:17:30] <kinblas> 2.x was full of touch/mouse inconsistencies in terms of targets
[09:17:40] <_|Nix|_> I can check what happens on 4.1 in my emulator.
[09:18:00] <kinblas> it made it very hard to handle things since the targets for the touch events don't necessarily equal the targets in the synthesized mouse events
[09:18:16] <kinblas> that's why there's 2 methods for trying to kill the click event in the vmouse code
[09:18:28] <kinblas> proximity … and target

[09:22:36] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: I don't think the emulator will give you realistic results for events like this
[09:25:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, it reproduced the blue flash, which was also caused by a leftover mouseup.
[09:26:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Don't worry though ... my hopes are not up.
[09:32:44] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Using "click" on the screen is a disaster. It has to stay "vclick" ...
[09:32:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OTOH, "vclick" has this unwanted effect.
[09:33:15] <toddmparker> i see
[09:34:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I wonder ... what if I hook up to both, and only vclick closes the popup.
[09:34:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The other event simply gets eatern.
[09:38:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The solution seems to be to hook up to "click" to close the popup, and also eat vclick mouseup vmouseup touchend ...
[09:39:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I end up closing on "click" and eating a "mouseup" and "touchend" on Android 2.3.5 ...
[09:40:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No accidental popup chaining nor fixed toolbar toggling.
[09:40:08] <toddmparker> interesting
[09:40:30] <toddmparker> if that works and checks out in testing, seems like a good solution
[09:41:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The mouseup and touchend get eaten before the click arrives, which is good, because the click closes the popup, so eating events after one is supposed to be gone is probably bad manners.
[09:41:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... but it does kinda make sense: If the screen is not supposed to let any events pass, then it's supposed to eat a whole bunch of them, after all.
[09:42:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: If I ignore events on the screen, then I cannot expect them to not pass.
[09:42:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm merely ensuring that the target is the screen, but I am not ensuring that they do not reach the document.
[09:43:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and it looks like a lot of things work on coordinates rather than target.
[09:43:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'll test this change on iOS and WP7 as well before pushing.
[09:44:44] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: F0rk! Now there's a blue flash upon dismissing the popup.
[09:48:09] <toddmparker> gah
[09:48:34] <toddmparker> yeah, things seem to be by coordinates which is why if things move, the target can be wrong
[09:59:05] <_|Nix|_> Grrr ... the dialog example is flickering.
[09:59:12] <_|Nix|_> So is the photo example.
[10:00:21] <_|Nix|_> ... on Android 2.3.5 ...
[10:02:43] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15nathanathan opened issue #5311: Nested delegate elements cause swipe event duplication  02http://git.io/cBRQDA
[10:03:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think I'm only noticing the blue flash on exit because I'm running in an emulator, which is slow.
[10:07:55] <toddmparker> could be
[10:08:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The blue flash is happening on the Andoird 2.3.5 device as well, because I added a console.log to the code that causes it. The console.log is printed, but the blue flash is not seen, because the popup disappears soon after.
[10:09:05] <toddmparker> without the console.log, no flash?
[10:09:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: However, the emulator is sufficiently slow to see the blue flash.
[10:09:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Nono ... on the device there does not appear to be a flash, but there would be if it was slower.
[10:09:30] <toddmparker> do you have  attest page I can try on a phone?
[10:09:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The emulator is indeed slower.
[10:09:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: You probably wouldn't see a blue flash on a phone.
[10:10:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'll put it up. Jussec.
[10:10:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/jquery-mobile/docs/pages/popup/index.html Click on Tooltip, then Dialog, or something ...
[10:12:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The focus restriction code is getting triggered grabbing focus from the page.
[10:13:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I might introduce another flag to turn off that code during popup close.
[10:13:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: If the popup's gonna close anyway, there's no point continuing to prevent focus loss.
[10:13:40] <toddmparker> looks solid on my phone
[10:13:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: In fact I should hook that code up during open, and unhook it during close.
[10:14:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I know. It's pretty good, but the blue flash is there.
[10:14:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, for all intents and purposes it's a good fix.
[10:14:29] <toddmparker> i'm running 2.3.6 and don't see a blue flash
[10:14:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Neither am I seeing one with 2.3.5.
[10:14:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Try a 4.x device.
[10:14:53] <toddmparker> ok
[10:14:54] <_|Nix|_> Shouldn't see it either.
[10:15:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I gotta go make some porridge :) Lemme know ...
[10:17:30] <toddmparker> no blue flash on 4.0 either
[10:17:42] <toddmparker> popups are kinda slow to open but they work fine
[10:17:59] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK ... so, provisionally, this is going in ...
[10:18:07] <toddmparker> if i open tooltip, then tap on the button below, it closes and doesn't activate the button
[10:18:27] <toddmparker> i can't get it to click the wrong thing at all
[10:18:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: good ... I'm pretty much eating anything that has to do with the mouse button lifting ...
[10:18:38] <toddmparker> ok
[10:18:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Nice!
[10:18:44] <toddmparker> yeah, great
[10:19:06] <toddmparker> was wondering if we should re-look at the popup positioning after resize
[10:19:20] <toddmparker> we switch to window
[10:19:29] <toddmparker> but on desktop and tablet, that feels odd
[10:19:44] <toddmparker> might be worth seeing if we can re-position
[10:20:05] <_|Nix|_> Of course we can, but we'd have to scroll the page too.
[10:21:07] <_|Nix|_> ... if it turns out that the origin's gone out of view.
[10:22:18] <toddmparker> scrolling is tricky
[10:22:40] <toddmparker> my question is whether we can simply re-position the popup over the origin but not scroll the page
[10:22:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... which is why we went with position-to-window.
[10:22:54] <toddmparker> that way, we're not messing with native behavior and keeping it simple
[10:23:22] <toddmparker> the scrolling out of view is mostly a phone situation
[10:23:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We can simply ignore that the origin is out of view, and sort of bump into the edge of the window trying to reach it.
[10:23:55] <toddmparker> right
[10:24:24] <toddmparker> reposition it so it fits on the page over the origin but it may not be scrolled into view
[10:24:36] <toddmparker> think that would be way better
[10:24:50] <toddmparker> esp. on tablets
[10:24:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Wait, lemme get this straight: the popup can disappear from view while open?
[10:25:34] <toddmparker> i can open a popup now and scroll the page down so it's out of view. not a big deal
[10:25:42] <toddmparker> we don't' force the popup to stay in view
[10:26:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: How about this: the popup does always stay in view, and when the origin is also in view, it's centred over it. When not, it's towards that edge of the window that is closest to the out-of-view origin.
[10:27:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's kinda like the popup is connected to the origin by an elastic, but it's constrained to always be visible.
[10:27:51] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: On tablets, assuming not-too-big pages, it should always be centred over the origin.
[10:28:09] <toddmparker> not sure i follow, sorry
[10:28:39] <toddmparker> mind doing a prototype?
[10:28:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: If the origin moves to a position above the window, the popup will appear along the top edge of the window.
[10:29:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: If the origin moves to a position below the window, the popup will appear along the bottom edge of the window.
[10:30:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I can do a proto, but only after my daughter goes to bed. She's got a stuffy nose so the night might be dicy.
[10:32:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... might hang up the ole hat a little earlier.
[10:40:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: are you in favor of clear button on textarea?
[10:41:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: when you typed whole message on your phone and accidently touch the clear button you are no happy
[10:41:29] <uGoMobi> s/no/not/
[10:42:23] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: no rush, just wanted to re-think a bit
[10:42:41] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yeah, clear button there is unusual
[10:43:25] <toddmparker> these would all be opt-in except for search so i guess if someone really wanted to add it...
[10:44:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, people should add cancel button to their form for clearing a textarea
[10:57:55] <toddmparker> the main thing holding us up on the clear button is the number and other html5 inputs?

[11:16:31] <toddmparker> dang. all done?
[11:20:24] <uGoMobi> yeah, thinks so
[11:20:39] <uGoMobi> need to test on some browsers
[11:36:49] <toddmparker> did you note this in the form docs?
[11:37:08] <toddmparker> we should add a section here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/docs-forms.html
[11:37:28] <toddmparker> and examples here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/textinputs/
[11:38:01] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes I will take care of that
[11:38:24] <uGoMobi> looking at the slider number input now
[11:39:35] <uGoMobi> have to make sure that it doesn't get the clear button if you set the default for option clearBtn to true
[11:41:14] <uGoMobi> the branch already contains a textinput demo page
[11:42:57] <toddmparker> good call on the slider
[11:43:34] <toddmparker> I think these pages will just go to the api site but if you write a blurb on how to use this on those pages, agcolom  can copy it over
[11:48:25] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: seems like popups with <p> tags have no bottom padding in the api docs
[11:48:26] <toddmparker> http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/popup/
[11:48:38] <toddmparker> were those demo.css styles?
[11:49:24] <toddmparker> padding just seems off there
[11:49:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no, it's in structure CSS
[11:49:44] <toddmparker> hmm
[11:50:00] <uGoMobi> can't close the photo popup there
[11:50:06] <uGoMobi> close btn doesn't work
[11:50:47] <toddmparker> odd
[11:50:59] <toddmparker> the popup divs have padding-bottom:0
[11:51:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the problem seems to be ui-content
[11:51:46] <toddmparker> i see
[11:51:46] <toddmparker> view-source:http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/resources/popup/example2.html
[11:51:51] <uGoMobi> there is custom CSS that sets the padding for ui-content there
[11:51:54] <toddmparker> .ui-content{
[11:51:55] <toddmparker> 		padding:10px 15px 0px 15px;
[11:51:57] <toddmparker> 	}
[11:51:57] <toddmparker> yeah
[11:52:00] <toddmparker> wonder why
[11:52:07] <uGoMobi> I remember we had to negate something in our docs
[11:52:18] <uGoMobi> because of the docs CSS
[11:52:25] <toddmparker> i see
[11:52:32] <toddmparker> i was wondering if agcolom added it
[11:52:42] <uGoMobi> maybe it has been copied over while it's not needed cos there is no docs CSS
[11:54:35] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: or maybe the CSS that has been added is needed for the API docs iframe examples
[11:55:05] <uGoMobi> but should be negated for popup
[11:55:17] <uGoMobi> and probably dialog as well
[11:57:18] <uGoMobi> same problem for listviews http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/listview/
[12:02:24] <toddmparker> i already wrote agcolom so we can see what she says. we can always help her write more targeted styles if those are needed
[12:05:02] <uGoMobi> would be nice if we can prevent adjusting any framework CSS
[12:06:20] <toddmparker> oh sure, think we can
[12:06:53] <toddmparker> we could always write a selector to apply those padding rules to the first child of the page if needed
[12:07:02] <toddmparker> i think we can probably remove a lot of those styles
[12:07:16] <uGoMobi> better to have clean examples, no negating like we had to do with current docs CSS
[12:07:23] <toddmparker> right
[12:07:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: question about the slider
[12:08:00] <toddmparker> sure
[12:08:03] <uGoMobi> what sets the input to type="number"?
[12:08:17] <uGoMobi> is that a browser thing?
[12:08:44] <uGoMobi> I don't see us changing type="range" into type="number" in the JS
[12:08:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi its to negate native browser controls
[12:09:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry, what do you mean?
[12:09:14] <arschmitz> so we can make them consistant
[12:09:23] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: it's done via the degrade inputs plugin
[12:09:30] <toddmparker> we convert the range to number
[12:09:34] <uGoMobi> ahhhh that's it
[12:09:41] <uGoMobi> I forgot about that one
[12:09:47] <uGoMobi> was looking in slider JS
[12:09:51] <toddmparker> it's an oddball, but needed
[12:10:00] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:10:04] <arschmitz> search goes to text also
[12:10:22] <uGoMobi> thanks, now I know where I can find it
[12:10:24] <toddmparker> yep
[12:10:39] <toddmparker> all those html5 form elements where styles are a black box
[12:14:32] <uGoMobi> but I see we set the data-type attr when we degrade it so it's safe to use that as selector for clearBtn blacklist

[12:24:03] <toddmparker> woah, synchronicity
[12:24:15] <arschmitz> apparently!
[12:24:18] <toddmparker> arschmitz: ha, old school
[12:24:39] <toddmparker> So arschmitz, I want to formerly welcome you to the team
[12:24:51] <toddmparker> You now have commit access.
[12:24:54] <arschmitz> i got the email Thank you
[12:24:58] <toddmparker> Congrats!
[12:25:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: congrats! 
[12:25:31] <toddmparker> You've been doing an incredible job so far, might as well make it easier for you to contribute
[12:25:35] <arschmitz> now its time to break stuff!
[12:25:48] <toddmparker> yep. inevitable
[12:28:18] <arschmitz> toddmparker: had something i was hoping for your input on
[12:28:52] <toddmparker> sure
[12:28:58] <toddmparker> (btw - http://jquery.org/team/)
[12:29:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and i have been talking more about the widgets and things like _destroy and _on the stuff we talked about in the meeting last week
[12:29:14] <toddmparker> yessir
[12:29:18] <toddmparker> +1000
[12:29:35] <arschmitz> Nice!
[12:30:11] <arschmitz> but anyway we were thinking we should change those issues into something more general like review all widgets for ui standards and tag it dev tasks for 1.4
[12:30:36] <arschmitz> and list all the widgets in the issue and check them off as we go
[12:30:56] <toddmparker> that works for me
[12:31:14] <toddmparker> seems like 1.4 should be all about refactoring code
[12:31:20] <arschmitz> cool johnbendeer: said he liked it as well
[12:31:40] <toddmparker> i think we have the manpower to crank through this stuff now
[12:32:02] <arschmitz> yup and this has the potential to break some things in really edge cases so its a good to do it at the same time as other stuff
[12:32:20] <arschmitz> like if people depend on refresh not actually working or destory not actually working
[12:32:40] <toddmparker> irght
[12:32:44] <toddmparker> right
[12:33:02] <toddmparker> i'd rather make a bunch of changes like this at once anyway
[12:33:25] <toddmparker> the html and css needs some serious simplification too
[12:33:31] <arschmitz> yeah i know _|Nix|_ and i are pretty gung ho on this one so hopefully we will be able to crank through it once we are done with 1.3
[12:33:46] <toddmparker> cool. we have volunteers
[12:34:02] <toddmparker> think the two of you would be a good pair to go heads down on this
[12:34:04] <arschmitz> also speaking of 1.3 there are at least a few issues that doing this review will fix 
[12:34:36] <toddmparker> if there are cases where issues will be solved much better with changes slated for 1.4, move them out to that milestone
[12:34:57] <toddmparker> rather fix something right once, even if it has to wait a bit longer
[12:35:41] <arschmitz> yeah like 4990 is a good example
[12:36:31] <arschmitz> its because there is no refresh method
[12:36:35] <toddmparker> ah, yeah we can move that out if we want
[12:36:56] <arschmitz> also 3771 same thing dosent have proper refresh
[12:37:31] <arschmitz> 3577, and 1835 also
[12:38:41] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ok and last question the issues for _destroy and _on should i just close those and refrence them in this new issue or keep them open and close once done?
[12:38:55] <toddmparker> those last two could happen now since it seems like those should provide a style hook
[12:39:04] <toddmparker> but we can discuss
[12:39:38] <arschmitz> yeah i was just meaning that thats another ui standards thing so no matter what they will be fixed as part of reviewing them
[12:39:52] <toddmparker> arschmitz: not sure on your Q about the issues
[12:40:12] <toddmparker> oh, i see
[12:40:24] <toddmparker> you already have destroy nd _on tickets
[12:40:33] <arschmitz> exactly
[12:40:35] <toddmparker> and you just want a dev task to comply with ui
[12:40:40] <arschmitz> right
[12:40:44] <toddmparker> sure, close those and open the new one
[12:40:53] <arschmitz> ok
[12:41:05] <toddmparker> another part of that dev task should be to make the class config stuff work
[12:41:05] <arschmitz> makes our issues #'s look better that way ha ha ha
[12:41:10] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! So, I'm back for a little while ...
[12:41:17] <toddmparker> hey _|Nix|_ 
[12:41:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just in time was just talking to toddmparker about widget review hes all on board as well to really jump on reviewing all the widgets for 1.4
[12:44:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: +1
[12:45:34] <toddmparker> think we should close out the 1.3 issue first, but this can be a priority right after
[12:45:49] <toddmparker> if you guys want to move issues out of 1.3, go for it
[12:45:57] <toddmparker> rather tackle things logically 
[12:46:22] <toddmparker> arschmitz: you can now assign issues to yourself and add labels and milestones

[12:46:49] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i was just typeing the issue and realized that lol 
[12:48:58] <toddmparker> yep, you're a boss now
[12:50:23] <toddmparker> I just closed the RWD ticket since it's landed
[12:50:24] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5093
[12:52:25] <toddmparker> should we just close this one? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3340
[12:53:09] <toddmparker> think this is just normal android bugginess
[12:53:25] <arschmitz> its 8 months stale unless someone can confirm ourside a jsbin with latest i say close
[12:53:41] <arschmitz> if someone pops back around with it we can always re open
[12:54:35] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ and arschmitz - if there are any items you want to grab from this list, please do. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=19&page=1&state=open
[12:57:21] <toddmparker> looks like johnbender and uGoMobi have most of the issues there, time to share the wealth
[12:59:01] <arschmitz> toddmparker: iv been looking into a few of these already and wouldnt mind going through your thoughts on them.
[12:59:11] <toddmparker> ok
[13:00:07] <arschmitz> #1835 i think search-filter should be turned into a standard extension of the listview which would solve this. could be part of widget review for 1.4 right now we call searchfilter a widget but its not really
[13:01:18] <toddmparker> is it not written as and extension now?
[13:01:25] <arschmitz> this would also solve the problem with nested lists getting two filter boxes (not sure # on that one)
[13:01:55] <toddmparker> right
[13:01:55] <arschmitz> no not really its a giant delegate function
[13:02:17] <toddmparker> we should codify how extensions are written
[13:02:29] <toddmparker> the new tables are written as extensions to a table core
[13:02:50] <arschmitz> yeah _|Nix|_'s behivors and my workarounds are both proper extensions too
[13:03:19] <toddmparker> ok, so you think we should push this to 1.4 so we can do a larger re-factor?
[13:03:28] <arschmitz> thats my thought
[13:04:15] <arschmitz> it will make things so much cleaner and more consistant
[13:04:55] <toddmparker> I'm good with that. _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi ?
[13:05:14] <toddmparker> (i only get 1 vote, like everyone else)
[13:06:16] <arschmitz> lol
[13:06:41] <uGoMobi> should I read back or already decided?
[13:07:02] <toddmparker> btw - jlembeck, scottjehl and I are going to look at the panel stuff jason started
[13:07:07] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: read
[13:08:13] <toddmparker> so uGoMobi - think i should move all the custom table demos into the /demos/ folder
[13:15:05] <uGoMobi> no objectections against changing listview.filter in proper extension
[13:16:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually the behaviors namespace was johnbender's idea.
[13:16:24] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes, I will add table styling demos there too
[13:16:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know i just said you wrote it
[13:17:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... this sounds sizable for 1.4 ...
[13:17:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OTOH, 1.3 should be fairly spectacular ...
[13:18:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, we can ride that wave to further consolidate our code.
[13:18:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker, arschmitz: Converting the listview extensions to proper extensions will further align us with UI.
[13:18:57] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: i hope so
[13:19:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i just think its the proper way to fix those 2 issues
[13:19:17] <toddmparker> ok, so mind moving those to 1.4 then arschmitz 
[13:19:35] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I started moving the table demos into the new folder
[13:21:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Oh great ... eating all those events breaks dismissing via clicking on screen on iOS.
[13:21:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, that which makes Android work nicely breaks iOS ... webkit FTW!
[13:23:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: any input on turning listview filter into an extension?
[13:24:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: besides this... 22:15 <uGoMobi> no objectections against changing listview.filter in proper extension
[13:24:29] <uGoMobi> ?
[13:24:55] <uGoMobi> nice spelling
[13:25:02] <uGoMobi> objections :)
[13:25:05] <arschmitz> oh sorry i missed that some how
[13:25:14] <uGoMobi> ok np
[13:25:25] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yikes
[13:26:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yep. On iOS, if I eat touchend, I get no further events - which is proper.
[13:26:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: On Android, if I eat touchend, I also get mouseup, followed by click.
[13:27:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... as if I hadn't eaten touchend.
[13:27:46] <_|Nix|_> Maybe I'm doing this wrong. I'll ask in jquery-dev what's the proper way to stop an event dead in its tracks.
[13:29:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: toddmparker: thoughts on 3577 3578 moving to 1.4 for widget review ?
[13:29:20] <toddmparker> arschmitz: can you paste in links?

[13:37:36] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: can the clear button issue be closed? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1834
[13:37:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am writing comment there right now
[13:37:58] <uGoMobi> I'll close it
[13:39:57] <toddmparker> ok
[13:40:10] <toddmparker> i've been debugging the reflow demo because it was broken
[13:40:22] <toddmparker> turns out I was missing a dang }
[13:40:25] <toddmparker> grr
[13:43:01] <toddmparker> view source widget works great
[13:43:17] <toddmparker> little unruly for tables, but that's just  a lot of markup
[13:44:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: it's a bit slow.... have to change it so the syntax highlight stuff is done when you click the view source button, not on pageinit
[13:45:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm afraid I'll have to yank all those nice changes I've made. It's that or a setTimeout() ... I'm not sure which is worse.
[13:46:01] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: bummer
[13:46:53] <agcolom> toddparker hi! you need me for something>
[13:46:54] <agcolom> ?
[13:46:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: +1 for moving those 2 issues to 1.4
[13:47:18] <arschmitz> cool done deal
[13:47:41] <arschmitz> that also gets us under 20 issues for 1.3 WOO!
[13:48:05] <uGoMobi> and 200 for 1.4? ;-)
[13:48:33] <arschmitz> ha ha actually 1.3 and 1.4 are currently tied at 19
[13:48:34] <agcolom> I'm still working on the api docs to get all the widgets up with the latest grunt version (so code examples are generated automatically)
[13:51:05] <toddmparker> hi agcolom 
[13:51:13] <agcolom> Hi toddmparker !
[13:51:14] <toddmparker> that will be a big timesaver
[13:51:26] <toddmparker> agcolom: i emailed you about a few things
[13:51:44] <toddmparker> tables are ready to be added
[13:51:47] <agcolom> yes. scott G has been wonderfully helpful!)
[13:51:54] <toddmparker> oh great
[13:51:59] <toddmparker> good to hear
[13:52:02] <agcolom> just catching up.
[13:52:19] <agcolom> had a ceremony evening! 
[13:52:32] <agcolom> (student graduation ceremony)
[13:52:34] <toddmparker> what's that?
[13:52:36] <toddmparker> ah
[13:52:42] <toddmparker> that's fun
[13:53:01] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: think we might need a max-height on those code popups, they are massive
[13:53:44] <agcolom> meeting parents... yes, really nice actually! one of my students may end up being employed by a guy I met in the queue for voting for the French President!
[13:54:06] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok we can make it scroll
[13:54:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1835
[13:54:22] <toddmparker> you'll see once i check these pages in
[13:54:32] <toddmparker> agcolom: impressive
[13:54:48] <agcolom> (that guy worked with the Angry birds guys! They've created a mobile game which is 1st in 5 countries!)
[13:54:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe I don't understand it right but listview filter has a class already
[13:55:29] <agcolom> think business at every opportunity ;)
[13:56:16] <toddmparker> agcolom: very cool.
[13:56:28] <toddmparker> so arschmitz is now an official committer
[13:57:21] <agcolom> oh! Congrats!
[13:57:34] <agcolom> really cool!!!! 
[13:57:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this is about adding a suffixed class vs generic one
[13:58:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see... should have read more carefully
[13:58:55] <uGoMobi> or have another coffee first
[13:59:21] <arschmitz> Thank you agcolom
[13:59:22] <agcolom> toddmparker: 1st version of the getting started with JQM guide is in on Learn. So as soon as the site goes live, we have something there
[13:59:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats ok i completely missed your comment earlier lol
[14:00:29] <toddmparker> agcolom: great. is there a preview?
[14:00:30] <uGoMobi> thanks for understanding :)
[14:00:54] <agcolom> http://stage.learn.jquery.com/jquery-mobile/getting-started/ 
[14:01:08] <agcolom> the links will not work until it's on the live server
[14:01:23] <toddmparker> nice
[14:01:28] <toddmparker> so that's from the docs
[14:02:29] <agcolom> I had to modify slightly to adapt to the learn style ;-)
[14:02:47] <agcolom> (I also added a footer to the example)
[14:03:18] <agcolom> What I thought was that we now have a whole area there, so we could have a whole range of tutorials there
[14:03:46] <agcolom> this one is a beginner's one. We could add more advanced ones.
[14:03:55] <agcolom> when we're ready
[14:03:59] <toddmparker> very cool
[14:04:21] <toddmparker> maybe the phone gap and backbone pages could be re-purposed
[14:04:24] <toddmparker> or scripting pages
[14:04:32] <agcolom> I think that'd be a good bridge between the api docs and the new docs.
[14:04:38] <agcolom> exactly!
[14:05:19] <toddmparker> the one minor concern I have is the fragmentation of where to find things: api, demos, learning
[14:05:25] <toddmparker> guess we can cross-link
[14:05:54] <agcolom> yes
[14:06:04] <agcolom> we need people to be very clear about that
[14:06:22] <agcolom> as soon as I update stuff, it will be live
[14:07:01] <agcolom> I was so keep to have the basics there before the learn site was anounced!
[14:07:06] <agcolom> announced ^
[14:07:35] <agcolom> It may get announced tomorrow....
[14:08:55] <toddmparker> really? that's soon
[14:08:59] <uGoMobi> looks great agcolom !
[14:09:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: they still haven't found the new JQM logo ;-)
[14:09:44] <agcolom> toddmparker: the learn site! That's the last time I heard.... 
[14:10:12] <agcolom> but it looks like things may have not gone as expected, so there may be some delay... 
[14:11:34] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Thanks :)
[14:11:56] <agcolom> it's my birthday tomorrow, so may have a day off :)
[14:16:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you think you can sleep tonight? ;-)
[14:20:42] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, I'm planning on enjoying my young age while I can ;) 
[14:21:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: so you are going out tonight?
[14:21:18] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:21:49] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I did ;) 
[14:22:07] <uGoMobi> good
[14:22:22] <agcolom> had a nice lunch too... my partner has got lots of meeting tomorrow... so we went for lunch today :)
[14:22:31] <agcolom> it was very nice ;)
[14:22:53] <uGoMobi> sounds great... pre birthday
[14:23:03] <agcolom> exactly ;)
[14:23:07] <uGoMobi> after party is on thursday?
[14:23:28] <agcolom> uGoMobi: saturday hopefully ;)
[14:23:37] <uGoMobi> cool
[14:23:52] <agcolom> Hope to have a few friends round... 
[14:24:51] <uGoMobi> have there already been project X parties in London?
[14:27:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: about the sliding panel https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5163#issuecomment-10572933 ... will the panel/navmenu be revealed like in JasonDScott_ his demo and Facebook, YouTube, etc. or slide in like in Wilto his demo?
[14:27:34] <toddmparker> happy birthday agcolom!!
[14:27:57] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yes, both
[14:28:07] <toddmparker> left/right and push/overlay
[14:28:19] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/SlidingPanel/docs/content/content-overflow.html
[14:28:28] <toddmparker> (ignore up, think that's too complex for now)
[14:28:30] <agcolom> toddmparker: Thanks :) one more day to enjoy being in my thirties.... (ok 22h or so....) 
[14:28:43] <agcolom> and I love the responsive tables!
[14:28:46] <toddmparker> those days are long gone for me agcolom 
[14:28:55] <toddmparker> i'm turning 40 in January.
[14:29:01] <toddmparker> thanks agcolom 
[14:29:11] <agcolom> toddmparker: I'm turning 40 tomorrow!
[14:29:24] <toddmparker> i just added simpler demos for those so you might want to use those in the api docs. fewer columns and rows
[14:29:26] <agcolom> I'm the eldest on the project!
[14:29:29] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok great. was looking at this demo http://filamentgroup.github.com/Slidenav/demo/ where push actually is slide in
[14:29:32] <agcolom> (I think!)
[14:29:35] <toddmparker> ah, so we're in the same boat :)
[14:29:42] <agcolom> toddmparker: indeed!
[14:30:15] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: so the menu either shoves the page over or sits over it
[14:30:24] <toddmparker> push = facebook
[14:30:33] <toddmparker> overlay = our new demos design
[14:30:49] <uGoMobi> ok great
[14:32:11] <toddmparker> looks like we need to clarify naming ;)

[14:32:22] <toddmparker> big commit to move stuff around
[14:32:30] <toddmparker> docs now just has the 3 api style docs for tables
[14:32:59] <toddmparker> demos has a bunch (@bottom) - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/
[14:33:20] <toddmparker> agcolom: this table might be simpler to work with in the docs - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/tables/reflow-basic.html
[14:33:41] <toddmparker> the view source is brief
[14:34:10] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/tables/column-basic.html
[14:34:16] <toddmparker> those two are simple
[14:34:27] <toddmparker> kinda cool to see who simple the markup is for those.
[14:34:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: can I remove the tables branch/
[14:34:35] <uGoMobi> ?
[14:34:45] <toddmparker> yes, meant to do that
[14:35:04] <uGoMobi> done
[14:35:15] <toddmparker> thanks
[14:35:29] <agcolom> toddmparker: good. so table is a widget? (I guess I have to have a look at the jQM code...)
[14:36:22] <toddmparker> agcolom: there is a table widget
[14:36:32] <agcolom> agcolom: perfect! 
[14:36:38] <toddmparker> and both modes (reflow and column toggle) are extensions to table
[14:36:39] <agcolom> toddmparker: perfect! 
[14:36:50] <toddmparker> so the docs may be interesting
[14:37:03] <toddmparker> i think each mode should be a separate docs page
[14:37:08] <agcolom> yes, I may need to think about that one :)
[14:37:14] <toddmparker> since they have different api stuff
[14:37:32] <toddmparker> the table script is just some shared table utilities
[14:37:47] <agcolom> yes, that's probably a good way to do it...
[14:37:52] <toddmparker> the extensions just listen for the table create event and do their thing
[14:38:01] <agcolom> ok... 
[14:38:05] <Krinkle> johnbender: _|Nix|_: I tried triggering a build of jQuery Mobile TestSwarm Master, but it fails for some reason. Could you look at it?
[14:38:18] <Krinkle> I try, since I updated the browserSet for it to include mobile browsers.
[14:38:20] <agcolom> probably friday/weekend task....
[14:38:30] <Krinkle> it hasn't run since 2012-09-17 
[14:38:45] <Krinkle> so I'll leave it to you to run it as/how/when you prefer
[14:40:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: really cool demo pages! 
[14:40:18] <uGoMobi> just looking at http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/tables/phone-compare.html
[14:41:57] <toddmparker> i want to cook up more like that uGoMobi 
[14:42:05] <toddmparker> using tables in different ways
[14:42:34] <uGoMobi> yeah... thats what the demos should be about
[14:42:34] <toddmparker> that compare fits on phones with all showing
[14:42:37] <toddmparker> right
[14:42:50] <toddmparker> most of these have a hefty style block in the head
[14:42:58] <uGoMobi> those example/text pages that I added before should go to another folder
[14:43:03] <toddmparker> i dare you to hit the view source button
[14:43:06] <uGoMobi> reference or something
[14:43:18] <uGoMobi> I just did :)
[14:43:24] <toddmparker> boom
[14:43:30] <toddmparker> works fine, just is super long
[14:43:33] <agcolom> yes, the view source works very nicely :)
[14:43:45] <toddmparker> yeah, it was crazy fast to drop that in
[14:45:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it fails in the sense that it doesn't pass the tests or it just fails
[14:45:41] <johnbender> Krinkle: ^
[14:45:42] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: the footer styling seems off in the demos too but since we're going to re-design, might not be worth fixing
[14:45:57] <Krinkle> johnbender: just fails, very early on
[14:46:04] <Krinkle> before grunt even
[14:46:05] <toddmparker> looks like agcolom will need help re-scoping those styles to not interfere with our widgets
[14:46:09] <johnbender> Krinkle: orly
[14:46:12] <johnbender> Krinkle: yah I'll take a look
[14:46:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes I saw that. It's just that I used a different class for demos
[14:46:21] <johnbender> Krinkle: might be tomorrow or thursday though
[14:46:28] <Krinkle> johnbender: suite yourself :)
[14:46:43] <Krinkle> I'm here if you need me.
[14:46:51] <johnbender> Krinkle: thanks
[14:46:52] <toddmparker> ok, i need to head out
[14:46:57] <toddmparker> talk you y'all tomorrow!

[16:52:01] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I cannot for the life of me get the damn thing to respect port 80
[16:52:10] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[16:52:15] <ryanneufeld> proably an order issue

[16:53:24] <ryanneufeld> odre matters
[16:53:51] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: how do you push it up the stack on the command line
[16:53:58] <johnbender> I'm rolling this into a chef recipe
[16:54:09] <ryanneufeld> nice
[16:54:13] <ryanneufeld> quick q
[16:54:19] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: shoot
[16:54:27] <ryanneufeld> where do you guys recommend placing JS on JQM pages?
[16:54:32] <ryanneufeld> header/footer?
[16:54:45] <ryanneufeld> like google analytics and the jquery includes
[16:54:46] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: depends on what JS you're talking about
[16:54:55] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: head for the jquery stuff
[16:55:03] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I found that seems to work best
[16:55:15] <ryanneufeld> but loading google analytics would be better in the footer you think?
[16:55:28] <johnbender> -I INPUT 1
[16:55:29] <johnbender> BAM!
[16:55:37] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I think that's what they recommend
[16:55:37] <ryanneufeld> Nice
[16:55:43] <johnbender> they have specific recommendation for that 
[16:55:49] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[16:55:50] <ryanneufeld> k
[16:56:07] <ryanneufeld> I'm also considering putting it all in an included js file
[16:56:31] <ryanneufeld> same one I'd include for the mobile settings
[18:54:43] <toddmparker__> johnbender: you still here?
[18:55:32] <toddmparker__> the reflow table examples aren't working on /test/
[18:55:48] <toddmparker__> Ex: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/tables/movie-list.html
[18:56:49] <toddmparker__> oddly, it's ok on localhost so I wonder if this is something up with the concat version of the script on latest
