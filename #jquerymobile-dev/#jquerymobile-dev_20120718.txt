[07:28:55] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Mat Marquis (4m, 2d ago): This admittedly silly fix seems to solve a number of bizarre problems on Android 2.3, all of which pretain to (empty) absolute positioned elements inside of fixed elements—in this case, absolute positioned icons in buttons in fixed headers—breaking user interaction with elements elsewhere on the page. Most notably, this issue was causing select menus to be eit

[07:29:38] <uGoMobi> Wilto: thanks!
[07:29:51] <Wilto> No worries, man. I got INTERNS I can throw at problems, now.
[07:30:01] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:30:02] <Wilto> So testing the hell out of that change, just in case.
[07:30:06] <uGoMobi> poor Andrew and Zach
[07:30:16] <Wilto> I’m already drunk with power.

[07:31:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I found a way to fix the Android / iframe issue
[08:26:59] <toddparker> yeah uGoMobi
[08:51:26] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: so what is position-to
[08:51:41] <toddparker> i don't see it listed as an option at the top of the script

[09:26:27] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I saw that issue with flip-toggle and radio... they are dynamically inserted so I first have to see what his code looks like
[09:52:34] <uGoMobi> but he doesn't want to share his code ^^^
[10:26:01] <toddparker> we need to look into this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2107#issuecomment-7074050

[10:50:50] <toddparker> anyone else seeing the popups flicker on the transition demo section?
[10:50:56] <toddparker> only there, but for all.
[10:51:04] <toddparker> on test
[10:51:19] <toddparker> ah, gotcha uGoMobi
[10:51:29] <toddparker> on the radios
[12:02:33] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: What browser?
[12:04:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome, about the iframe thing!
[12:05:05] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: What do you mean what is it? It's "origin" or "window" or a jQuery selector, specified on the link.
[12:17:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: still a bit work in progress though
[12:18:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP. Really happy that you're making progress.
[12:18:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can hide the iframe properly but having some trouble setting the width and height on the popupbeforeopen event
[12:18:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's not only on Android but also on Chrome
[12:20:13] <uGoMobi> so the solution is going to be a note in the docs about setting height and width of iframes dynamically
[12:20:55] <uGoMobi> but that is something you probably want to do anyway because you don't want your iframe being cut off on a small screen
[12:22:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: As you're testing this, also open the portrait and landscape photos, and make sure they work. Your solution must make them work.
[12:22:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: already tested... they work
[12:22:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, great!
[12:23:23] <uGoMobi> seems like Android is reporting correct height/width, at least on the popupbeforeopen event
[12:30:16] <_|Nix|_> Wha'd I miss?
[12:31:20] <toddparker> not too much
[12:31:23] <toddparker> quiet here today
[12:31:55] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Didn't quite get your question about position-to ...
[12:32:08] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I thought I had implemented it as agreed.
[12:32:17] <toddparker> so if you look in iOS 5
[12:32:36] <toddparker> all the popups under the transitions header have a blink when they come in
[12:32:41] <toddparker> this is a new thing
[12:32:58] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK. I'll have to grab the iOS device from the office.
[12:33:10] <toddparker> wait, position-to? it's great now, on the the link
[12:33:19] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah.
[12:33:21] <toddparker> we were trying to figure out how to document the option
[12:33:33] <toddparker> and i noticed it wasn't defined as an option like other things
[12:33:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I added it to the data-attributes.html to the link.
[12:33:46] <toddparker> that's cool
[12:33:48] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: It's not, because it's on the link.
[12:34:00] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Only popup options are defined as options.
[12:34:21] <toddparker> i also want to note it in the popup section on that page for convenience - we just need to set it of from the dialog markup stuff
[12:34:28] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The transition is an interesting one because it's both a popup option and a link option, with the value in the link taking precedence.
[12:34:43] <toddparker> ah
[12:34:53] <toddparker> those are odd
[12:34:53] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Well, position-to is unique to popup.
[12:35:08] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: There's a section in popup/index.html about positioning. I believe it's mentioned there.
[12:35:08] <toddparker> and the code for it is in popup.js
[12:35:26] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah. The link-click handler.
[12:35:27] <toddparker> i assumed there was an option for popups for position-to
[12:35:42] <toddparker> and somehow the link attr, if set, would update that
[12:35:46] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: You mean in popups for position-to, right?
[12:35:53] <toddparker> yeah
[12:35:57] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Nonono, that would be bad.
[12:36:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: You don't want to be updating popup options behind the user's back.
[12:36:24] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Overriding for a single use, that's another thing.
[12:36:33] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: But Overwriting permanently is bad.
[12:36:46] <toddparker> sure
[12:36:48] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The override is like shadowing a variable.
[12:37:13] <toddparker> these are just odd ducks
[12:37:22] <_|Nix|_> How do you mean?
[12:38:04] <toddparker> well, i'd assume i could open a popup programically and specify a transition and position-to
[12:38:30] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah ... I thought about that ...
[12:38:38] <toddparker> but there is no origin in that case
[12:38:59] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Well, you /can/ specify a transition by first setting the transition option.
[12:39:05] <toddparker> right
[12:39:10] <toddparker> but not position
[12:39:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: But yeah, no equivalent for position-to.
[12:39:26] <toddparker> they intuitively seem like equivalent situations
[12:39:39] <toddparker> that was why i asked
[12:39:42] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah ... *scratch head* ...
[12:40:05] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The problem is that you end up passing a lot of parameters to open().
[12:40:07] <toddparker> i can imagine a dev might want to open a popup based on a system event (login needed, error)
[12:40:17] <toddparker> and would want to position-to="window"
[12:40:38] <toddparker> yeah, but might be needed
[12:40:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah. I should probably do the shadowing thing with position-to as well.
[12:40:57] <toddparker> to make a popup as i described, how would you do it?
[12:41:28] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: You cannot do that easily as it stands.
[12:41:41] <toddparker> if positioning isn't exposed as an option, you'd need to re-create all that logic yourself
[12:41:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'll have to modify the open() function.
[12:41:48] <toddparker> which isn't really an option
[12:42:02] <toddparker> to make it a true option
[12:42:26] <toddparker> and the link can set that option for the instance, like transition?
[12:42:27] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Don't worry - you had me at *scratch head* ... I'm just thinking of ways to make it happen.
[12:42:41] <toddparker> ok, just asking dumb questions...
[12:42:48] <toddparker> in this case, i got lucky
[12:43:00] <toddparker> so that's worth looking into
[12:43:08] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Definitely.
[12:43:27] <toddparker> cool, appreciate it
[12:43:43] <toddparker> the other thing i noticed is that iOS transition issue
[12:43:43] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: NP.
[12:43:56] <toddparker> only happens on the transition examples
[12:44:06] <toddparker> other demos that use transitions like dialog are ok
[12:44:13] <toddparker> maybe it's a markup problem?
[12:44:18] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah. Gotta see that for myself. I've actually seen that on Android 2.3.5 as well - sometimes.
[12:44:27] <toddparker> these links all point to the same popup - could that be the problem?
[12:44:35] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I suspect it's got to do with interruptible transitions.
[12:44:40] <toddparker> this seems like a newer regression
[12:44:52] <toddparker> but it blinks when transition in completes
[12:44:57] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Nono. It doesn't matter how many links point to a popup.
[12:45:01] <toddparker> all transitions
[12:45:14] <toddparker> ok, figured but wanted to mention just in case
[12:45:17] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I remove .in when the transition completes. That might be the problem.
[12:45:25] <toddparker> probably
[12:46:05] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Once the transition completes, it's no longer needed, and it's a great way to interrupt the transition if it's not yet completed.
[12:46:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: But it seems it /is/ needed, because removing it causes the blink.
[12:46:31] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... on iOS ...
[12:47:41] <toddparker> i see
[12:48:00] <toddparker> i swear there weren't blinks a week ago
[12:48:39] <toddparker> why is the dialog example ok? it uses pop. the simple pop example blinks. odd.
[12:48:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: on FF13 the popup # is not removed when I close a popup... when I open and close a second popup I navigate 1 page back :(
[12:49:20] <toddparker> grr
[12:49:52] <agcolom> hello everyone :-)
[12:50:07] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[12:50:14] <toddparker> hi agcolom
[12:50:42] <toddparker> so _|Nix|_ - other than those 2 items (option for position-to, blink on transitions)
[12:50:44] <agcolom> What did I miss? what needs doing?
[12:50:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hangon.... can be my mistake
[12:50:58] <toddparker> i'd like to try removing the fade on the overlay
[12:51:07] <toddparker> to see if that improves rendering
[12:51:24] <toddparker> you see that come in as big squares of black instead of all together
[12:51:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yep... I bookmarked the url with #popupMap in it
[12:51:29] <uGoMobi> (sorry)
[12:51:37] <toddparker> thinking the animation might be killing it
[12:51:39] <uGoMobi> all good :)
[12:52:04] <toddparker> agcolom: you could take a look at the docs for position-to based on the comments
[12:52:17] <toddparker> if you agree of course :)
[12:52:19] <agcolom> sure, that's fine.
[12:52:46] <toddparker> _|Nix|_is actually going to make position-to a proper option for popups anyway, like transitions
[12:53:22] <toddparker> because you need to be able to programmatically open a popup and specify a transition and position
[12:53:36] <toddparker> position relies on you clicking a link right now
[12:53:52] <toddparker> so position needs to be exposed as an option
[12:56:01] <toddparker> i need to leave in a  few minutes for an event at my son's preschool
[12:56:09] <toddparker> i'll check in later tonight though
[12:56:30] <toddparker> hit me with Q's now if you have 'em
[12:56:45] <agcolom> toddparker: so is position-to going to be part of the popup js?
[12:57:02] <toddparker> yes, i think it needs to be. _|Nix|_?
[12:57:43] <toddparker> similar to how transition works - you can set it when you call the plugin or it gets zipped in when you click the link
[12:57:48] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Actually, maybe not.
[12:58:07] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Currently the link is getting passed into open like so: .open( x, y, $link ).
[12:58:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: But you could just as easily pass in any jQuery object.
[12:59:02] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, for example: $( "#popupBasic" ).popup( "open", 0, 0, $( {} ).jqmData( "position-to", "window" ).jqmData( "transition", "slide" ) );
[12:59:33] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: You basically attach the jqmData to a trivial jQuery object and that's it.
[12:59:41] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: It's one way to pass options.
[13:00:02] <aniasis> How can I disable these aria elements jqmobile is injecting into my page?
[13:01:15] <agcolom> ok, so maybe I'll start with the data-attribute page this evening and prepare some text for the popup page but will not yet add it...
[13:01:17] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, there is a not-so-complicated way to pass both transition and position-to into popup.
[13:01:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I mean, to pass it into open().
[13:02:05] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We just need to document that you can pass options that way.
[13:12:35] <toddparker> anias - this isn't a support forum
[13:12:47] <toddparker> but the aria is not configurable
[13:13:02] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: I see
[13:13:22] <toddparker> think johnbender or gseguin should weigh in too
[13:13:28] <toddparker> you guys around?

[13:49:45] <Wilto> Thanks, man.
[13:49:47] <uGoMobi> I say... new clone ;-)
[13:49:55] <Wilto> That’s what I’m thinking too.
[13:50:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: As soon as you open an iframe-based popup, the whole page breaks and goes back to being the old way, i.e., center on window does not work.
[13:50:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: whattt??
[13:50:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah :(
[13:50:48] <uGoMobi> on Android 2.3.5.?
[13:51:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Page looks great, popups work great, and then I open map or video and Bam! Page is broken and remains broken :(
[13:51:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, the page breaks when I return from the video or map popup.
[13:51:38] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: do you have any transitions on these ones?
[13:52:00] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Fade, probably.
[13:52:22] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: how about making it none just in case?
[13:52:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Maybe I have to set the height/width properties back to 0 on popupafterclose?
[13:52:35] <uGoMobi> or what is the event name again?
[13:52:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Give it a shot.
[13:52:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's correct.
[13:52:56] <uGoMobi> lemme try

[13:55:01] <uGoMobi> what?
[13:55:08] <agcolom> ah sorry hit return too quickly!

[13:56:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Not too familiar with that territory - sorry!
[13:57:22] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: no problem. regarding the popup docs, could you please also add an example of the use of a jqm element for centering the popup? (I think this is the one that may raise questions/issues if no demo is given).
[13:57:43] <agcolom> please :-)
[14:06:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: all that Maurice is saying there is that if you don't have a footer, you still have that gap (see his fiddle)... so that's true
[14:06:58] <uGoMobi> to be fussy: I think it should say "bottom of the page"
[14:07:27] <uGoMobi> but I am the last one here that should advise about proper English ;)
[14:09:23] <agcolom> uGoMobi: What I was thinking is maybe add both. So say that there may be a gap between to the end of the page or to the fixed footer if there is one.
[14:10:09] <agcolom> (the original section was about the gap with the fixed footer)
[14:10:47] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes I saw that... but makes sense to change it to bottom of the page (where could be a fixed footer)
[14:10:57] <agcolom> ok
[14:11:01] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[14:11:03] <uGoMobi> adding both is fine too...
[14:11:07] <uGoMobi> np
[14:12:27] <agcolom> Yes, I am thinking that people may think that a footer is still content and be surprised by the gap between the end of the content and the beginning of the footer because they may think the content would stretch to the footer

[14:27:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you give it another try?
[14:29:38] <agcolom> I think my bed is calling!!!!
[14:30:10] <uGoMobi> Jenkins is on dope... Latest build now only takes 12 secs instead of the 1.5 mins it used to be
[14:30:17] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[14:30:19] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone
[14:30:26] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper!
[14:30:36] <agcolom> is that 12s normal??
[14:32:14] <uGoMobi> nope
[14:34:01] <agcolom> uGoMobi: is that a bad sign then?
[14:34:27] <uGoMobi> just something to keep an eye on, checking the code now
[14:34:37] <uGoMobi> could just be server improvement
[14:34:48] <agcolom> that'd be good ;-)
[14:35:09] <agcolom> ok, I'm really going to bed now! Goodnight again :-)
[14:52:12] <gseguin> Hi all!
[14:52:54] <gseguin> getting started in the Boulder office, should be back to normal pace next week
[14:54:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Trying now ...
[14:56:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Afraid not :(
[14:56:11] <uGoMobi> hi gseguin
[14:56:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: grrr
[14:56:36] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Good stuff! Lotsa skiing around there, eh?
[14:57:01] <uGoMobi> on 2.3.3. (SDK) and 4.0 device it looks ok
[14:57:01] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: IIRC ...
[14:57:02] <gseguin> yeah skiing, mountaineering, plenty of good stuff
[14:57:14] <uGoMobi> gseguin: are you happy with your move to CO?
[14:57:32] <gseguin> yeah, could have gone a little smoother
[14:57:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, 2.3.5 and it h0rkz0rz ...
[14:57:43] <gseguin> but it's done
[14:57:48] <uGoMobi> I see
[14:58:39] <uGoMobi> gseguin: well I hope you and your family feeling at home there soon
[14:59:41] <johnbender> gseguin: can I bend your ear for a second?
[14:59:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't know how to debug, so I really don't have a clue what to do now
[15:00:15] <uGoMobi> hi johnbender
[15:00:18] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hey
[15:00:30] <uGoMobi> johnbender: you at OSCON already?
[15:00:34] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I am
[15:00:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. It's just Android being fragile.
[15:00:37] <johnbender> sitting in a talk right now
[15:00:45] <johnbender> working on my blerg post
[15:00:50] <johnbender> for tommorrow morning
[15:00:51] <uGoMobi> ah ok... then we whisper
[15:00:59] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm listening
[15:01:02] <johnbender> lawl
[15:01:37] <uGoMobi> johnbender: FYI - Wilto committed the change to &#160;
[15:02:09] <uGoMobi> johnbender: also... we have a new record for latest build: 12 sec ;-)
[15:04:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am going to install 2.3.5. on SDK tomorrow and then add an alert to see what values width() and height() return
[15:04:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hell yah
[15:04:57] <johnbender> Wilto: thanks!
[15:05:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: thanks to you too for taking care of that
[15:05:07] <johnbender> I definitely dumped it on you
[15:05:29] <uGoMobi> nah, but you're welcome anyway
[15:07:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: After you open one iframe, width === document width and height === document height ...
[15:10:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's not what we want :(
[15:12:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Place this file somewhere in your Web servers dirs: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/console.php.txt
[15:12:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Rename it to console.php
[15:12:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool, thanks!
[15:12:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then include <script src="/path/to/console.php"></script> from popup/index.html
[15:13:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then, if you use console.log() inside your .js, it will append the logs to /tmp/php-console.log
[15:13:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Tested on Linux.
[15:13:31] <uGoMobi> great
[15:13:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, in a terminal, you can tail -f /tmp/php-console.log and see your messages appear live.
[15:14:12] <uGoMobi> ok
[15:14:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's what I've been using with Android.
[15:14:42] <uGoMobi> good solution
[15:15:36] <uGoMobi> I never figured out how to do that with the SDK and never managed to connect my device to it either :(
[15:18:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Poor man's console. All thanks to the almighty AJAX ...
[15:18:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lol :D
[15:19:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Amsterdam can be proud :)
[15:19:42] <uGoMobi> haha
[15:20:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: AJAX is performing better than AJAX Amsterdam though
[15:23:27] <_|Nix|_> :)
