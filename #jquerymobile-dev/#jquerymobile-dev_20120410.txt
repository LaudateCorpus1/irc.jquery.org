[01:04:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] address non docs zip build size issues - John Bender
[08:31:14] <toddparker> morning all
[08:31:29] <toddparker> happy that no big issues have come in from RC2
[08:31:36] <toddparker> anyone see any red flags?
[08:31:50] <toddparker> if not, i'm going to initiate launch sequence for later this week
[08:33:49] <Wilto> We are go for launch.
[08:34:05] <Wilto> Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed.
[08:58:57] <Wilto> gseguin: We have any easy way of reordering categories, in the builder?
[08:58:57] <bot-t> (1 min 43 secs ago) <wesbos> tell Wilto how hard is refinishing something like this? http://wes.io/Fi7v
[08:59:16] <Wilto> brb; carpentry
[09:45:35] <gseguin> Wilto: if we want alphabetical order, easy
[09:45:50] <Wilto> Hey, that’d be fine. As long as we have some way to control it.
[09:45:50] <gseguin> if we want custom order then a little more time
[09:45:59] <Wilto> Numerical?
[09:46:09] <Wilto> I’ll just slap a number at the start of each heading.
[09:46:10] <gseguin> probably need to introduce another meta
[09:46:41] <Wilto> DAMMIT, METADATA
[09:47:01] <gseguin> :)
[09:48:19] <Wilto> But yeah, I’m cool with alphanumeric/numeric for now.
[09:48:46] <gseguin> ok, I'll put that in the todo
[09:48:47] <Wilto> Co-signed by toddparker.
[09:48:51] <Wilto> Awesome. Thanks, dude!
[09:49:01] <gseguin> will get to it tomorrow morning
[09:50:14] <Wilto> Bam; all styled up pretty-like.
[09:56:30] <gseguin> oh so pretty!
[09:59:12] <Wilto> What a difference a few lines of CSS makes. We get this sucker reordered, and we are ready to:
[09:59:17] <Wilto> ?SHIPIT
[09:59:17] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/button.gif
[09:59:57] <gseguin> there is still the submit button to fix
[10:00:06] <gseguin> and the zip thinggy to implement on the backend
[10:00:16] <gseguin> but we're getting there
[10:15:05] <Wilto> Too late, gseguin—I already used the SHIPIT gif.
[10:15:08] <Wilto> We have no choice now.
[10:24:39] <toddparker> i'll work on the organization of these things…looks like a developer put this thing together
[10:25:17] <gseguin> hey!
[10:26:00] <gseguin> I always say: "don't let the plumber design the toilets"
[10:30:15] <toddparker> indeed. now back to my plumbing sir. don't you have zips to build :p
[10:30:25] <Wilto> Ugh. _Developers_.
[10:30:46] <Wilto> Hate ’em.
[10:31:06] <gseguin> I'll get on that tomorrow
[10:31:52] <Wilto> Hating developers, gseguin?
[10:32:13] <gseguin> yeah that too, why not?
[10:32:16] <gseguin> :D
[10:35:40] <Wilto> DAMMIT, ALL DEVELOPERS
[11:37:33] <toddparker> johnbender, gseguin, kinblas and Wilto - we all in agreement that nothing major has come in during RC2 so we should leave the code untouched and target friday for launch?
[11:37:43] <toddparker> we can make docs changes this week
[11:37:56] <Wilto> toddparker: http://wil.to/_/yes.gif
[11:38:03] <gseguin> didn't see anything major
[11:38:09] <Wilto> I’d be totally content to just focus on the builder for the remainder of the week.
[11:38:18] <johnbender> toddparker: can we take the "data-visible-on-page-show" out of the docs?
[11:38:31] <Wilto> Oh, I thought that was in.
[11:38:32] <johnbender> I'm working on that pr now, it's broken
[11:38:40] <Wilto> Ahh.
[11:38:40] <johnbender> nope the feature doesn't work
[11:38:49] <Wilto> Nobody uses features nowadays.
[11:38:58] <johnbender> and the hide method doesn't work unless the toolbars are fullscreen
[11:39:05] <Wilto> Huh.
[11:39:19] <johnbender> I'm going to ping Scott on it again once I finish these tests to ask him about that
[11:40:59] <toddparker> ok johnbender - is that the type of fix you'd be ok landing for 1.1 final?
[11:40:59] <toddparker> since it can't get any more broken?
[11:41:17] <johnbender> toddparker: yah I guess
[11:41:25] <johnbender> though I'm inclined not to make that assumption
[11:41:35] <johnbender> I don't see that feature being super duper pivotal but it's up to you guys
[11:44:47] <Wilto> Nah. I mean, I’m telling myself it would be cool for the sake of making the new fixed toolbars a 1:1 thing with the old one.
[11:44:57] <Wilto> But who knows what else got nicked in that department anyway, y’know?
[11:45:22] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: ah, I didn't realize that it was an existing api
[11:45:27] <johnbender> yah then we don't really have a choice
[11:45:29] <Wilto> Oh, yeah.
[11:46:04] <Wilto> But, where there was such a big overhaul on the fixed toolbars anyway, I’d be fine with leaving it out for now. Add a “coming soon” in the docs, or something.
[11:47:02] <johnbender> Wilto: well we've already broken with the previous api in a bunch of ways which IMO we should avoid at all costs
[11:47:11] <johnbender> it only causes problems for people
[11:47:54] <Wilto> Yep. “Will people raise hell” is my measure for what gets snuck into 1.1, at this point.
[11:48:32] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll land  the fix for the fullscreen and maybe scott can handle the other with tests?
[11:50:04] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: it might bear a quick bit of testing once I merge into master too
[11:50:15] <Wilto> johnbender: Just give the word.
[11:50:19] <johnbender> according to Scott it shouldn't be an issue but you never know
[11:50:23] <Wilto> Well. Jenkins will.
[11:51:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/DA1eqA
[11:51:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] test fullscreen fixed toolbar data-visible-on-page-show - John Bender
[11:51:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge branch 'pikotea-issue_3988' - John Bender
[11:51:11] <johnbender> Wilto: toddparker ^
[11:51:41] <Wilto> On it.
[11:52:01] <johnbender> I'll comment on basecamp
[11:56:27] <toddparker> thanks johnbender
[11:56:35] <toddparker> think that is worth fixing
[11:56:43] <toddparker> but no more, promise :)
[11:57:23] <toddparker> gseguin: do you know if we should have the require stuff on our copy of ui-widget
[11:57:33] <toddparker> updating meta data and notice that doesn't have it
[11:57:42] <gseguin> I removed it on purpose
[11:57:58] <gseguin> the goal is to not alter "third-party" components
[11:58:16] <gseguin> that'll allow easy alignment with future version
[11:58:34] <gseguin> toddparker: ^
[11:58:48] <toddparker> ok
[11:59:02] <gseguin> same for hashchange
[11:59:02] <toddparker> but it will be included with the build implicitly?
[11:59:05] <toddparker> ok
[11:59:10] <gseguin> yes
[11:59:31] <toddparker> actually, hash change has the meta data setup
[12:00:02] <gseguin> yeah but it's probably not used
[12:00:16] <gseguin> because it's not defining an AMD module
[12:00:32] <gseguin> in jquery.mobile.widget the define says:
[12:00:34] <gseguin> define( [ "jquery", "../external/requirejs/depend!./jquery.ui.widget[jquery]" ]
[12:00:58] <gseguin> that second dependency is the one that will pull in the ui.widget
[12:03:17] <toddparker> gotcha
[12:03:32] <toddparker> so i'm running the test suite before I check in these meta data changes
[12:03:48] <toddparker> do we need to do anything to re-generate the files for the builder?
[12:06:01] <toddparker> gseguin ^
[12:09:02] <gseguin> nope, just push to master
[12:09:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/8MFD7w
[12:09:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Updated meta data for each script for the future download builder - toddparker
[12:15:36] <gseguin> huh... weird there are 2 "core" sections
[12:19:15] <toddparker> think it's a typo
[12:19:53] <toddparker> adding a few tweaks
[12:19:58] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/0d9NIQ
[12:19:58] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Content tweaks in JS meta data - toddparker
[12:20:01] <toddparker> mat will hide "other" if empty
[12:20:22] <toddparker> as long as you alphabetize files within each group tomorrow, this is looking good
[12:20:46] <gseguin> Why do we need the "required" meta ?
[12:21:09] <toddparker> it was in there…Wilto
[12:21:21] <toddparker> it does keep you from unchecking stuff you can't uncheck
[12:21:36] <toddparker> btw - i fixed the double core issue
[12:21:44] <toddparker> does that org make sense to you gseguin
[12:21:46] <gseguin> well if you do, it will just uncheck all
[12:21:51] <toddparker> and johnbender
[12:22:05] <gseguin> gotta run
[12:22:15] <gseguin> be back in an hour or so

[12:30:28] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Revised transition metadata for clarity - toddparker
[12:33:33] <toddparker> alright Wilto - the meta data is in pretty good shape now
[12:33:33] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/5V16Lg
[12:33:33] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Last few meta data tweaks for capitalization - toddparker
[12:33:55] <toddparker> just need to add the check: all | none in thin each section
[12:35:37] <Wilto> toddparker: “Easy-peasy,” as Moriarty would say.
[13:00:43] <toddparker> just checked in some tweaks to that page
[13:00:45] <toddparker> i'm out

[13:01:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Updated category grouping metadata - toddparker
[13:03:49] <toddparker> gseguin: when your'e back, what's the situation with getting the builder up on the jqm server?
[13:32:47] <gseguin> toddparker: who is it I need to talk to to get a dedicated node server and some disk space
[13:32:49] <gseguin> ?
[13:40:28] <johnbender> gseguin: danheberden ? but that seems unlikely
[13:40:35] <johnbender> and I wouldn't put this on our server
[13:40:38] <johnbender> :(
[13:41:30] <gseguin> yeah no, our server does not need that
[13:41:47] <danheberden> there's a staging area for it - what's it using?
[13:42:08] <gseguin> node
[13:42:23] <danheberden> the thing is merging those services with the puppet configs
[13:42:28] <gseguin> right now it's hosted on Joyent's no.de machine
[13:42:49] <gseguin> and it's doing great there
[13:42:54] <danheberden> awes
[13:43:26] <gseguin> It's dedicated to this, no other funky business going on on that VM
[13:43:47] <danheberden> we're having our dev days thurs/fri and i hope to get more stuff squared away - besides just running the node server, anything else rquired?
[13:44:40] <gseguin> just disk space
[13:44:45] <gseguin> not a lot
[13:44:50] <danheberden> oh, yea, sry - you only get 80k
[13:45:05] <danheberden> just one 5.25" disk drive
[13:45:26] <gseguin> :)
[13:46:24] <danheberden> gseguin can you add your ssh key to the wiki in the repo i just added you to?
[13:46:30] <danheberden> i'd <3 you forever
[13:46:58] <gseguin> k
[13:47:35] <gseguin> danheberden: One of us needs to have SSH access to the machine that will run the service as the initial setup is manual
[13:48:01] <gseguin> initial setup for a branch that is
[13:49:39] <gseguin> danheberden: I've got 2 keys, is that going to be a problem?
[13:51:17] <danheberden> gseguin nah - though it'd be nice to get that part of puppet so we don't have to manually do it
[13:52:13] <gseguin> so the setup steps are cloning the repo in bare mode
[13:52:39] <gseguin> and then checkout the branch you want to have a builder for in a specific dir
[13:52:49] <gseguin> and that's it
[13:54:20] <gseguin> danheberden: my keys are in
[13:55:12] <danheberden> hmm, as much as that happens we should work on a module to express git clones and updates down the road. annnnnyway, awesome i'll add you to the box and get you up today
[13:57:53] <johnbender> gseguin: danheberden: I can help with the puppet setup if  that's still necessary
[13:58:01] <johnbender> ie automating the initial setup of the application
[13:58:06] <danheberden> johnbender ya totes
[14:21:09] <Wilto> danheberden: I also want a server.
[14:21:19] * danheberden gives wilto a server
[14:21:23] <Wilto> danheberden: For my animated gifs.
[14:21:40] <Wilto> “LOOK UNDER YOUR CHAIRS!” —danheberden
[14:21:57] <danheberden> "YOU GET A SERVER! YOU GET A SERVER! AND YOU GET A SERVER!"
[14:22:05] <danheberden> "EVERYBODY GETS A SERVER!!!!!"
[14:22:21] <Wilto> http://bukk.it/oprahs-bees.gif
[14:24:46] <gseguin> FUCK YEAH!
[14:25:51] <gseguin> one developer - one server
[14:26:08] <gseguin> no developer left behind
[14:26:47] <kinblas> lol
[14:27:14] <danheberden> except that one, but seriously - who did he think he was?
[14:27:33] <danheberden> thank goodness we were more qualified to answer that question than him
[14:28:30] <Wilto> Yes. We have a zero-tolerance policy for being Wrong On The Internet™.
[14:29:58] <Wilto> gseguin: Buncha updates to the builder. Check that business out, man.
[14:32:42] <gseguin> Wilto: kewl! though the "select all" don't trigger the dependency mechanism
[14:32:56] <Wilto> Oh, weak. On it.
[14:35:40] <gseguin> we should put an easter egg in there
[14:35:58] <gseguin> like if you don't select anything and hit download point at vapor.js
[14:36:02] <gseguin> or something like that
[14:47:30] <Wilto> I like it.
[15:13:12] <Wilto> Okay, fixed.
[15:13:34] <Wilto> I’m out for the night, gents. Have a good one.
[15:24:20] <toddparker> thanks for your help mr. danheberden
[15:24:44] <toddparker> the builder is looking pretty enough for my tastes. wilt and I tidied that up today
[15:24:57] <toddparker> just need some sorting and zipping
[15:25:05] <toddparker> been working with tbenzige today on the TR
[15:25:09] <toddparker> looking good
[15:25:15] <johnbender> toddparker: wrt to the phonegap issue
[15:25:17] <toddparker> had some alpha testers give it a look
[15:25:21] <toddparker> no news = good news?
[15:25:35] <johnbender> I'm under the impression that there's no gurantee on the load order for scripts added to the page dynamically
[15:25:42] <toddparker> johnbender: which PG issue?
[15:25:51] <johnbender> toddparker: the one you send me the email on?
[15:25:58] <toddparker> ah, right on
[15:26:07] <johnbender> I'm such a browser newb though
[15:26:07] <toddparker> sorry, few PG issues floating around
[15:26:09] <johnbender> is that accurate?
[15:26:26] <toddparker> I think that's true
[15:26:43] <toddparker> unless you go out of your way to load things async
[15:26:54] <johnbender> toddparker: you mean "sync"
[15:27:01] <toddparker> right
[15:27:07] <toddparker> never trust anything i writeadasD
[15:27:47] <toddparker> probably can do a quick SO search to point him to
[15:28:08] <toddparker> i gotta jump for the night
[15:28:18] <toddparker> i'll start working on the 1.1 blog post…woo hoo
