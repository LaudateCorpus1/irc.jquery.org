[08:42:06] <toddparker> hey all
[08:48:26] <gseguin> good morning
[08:50:41] <toddparker> morning
[08:50:49] <toddparker> saw you and kinblas were discussing transitions
[08:50:58] <gseguin> yeah
[08:50:58] <toddparker> sorry if there was confusion on the transitions
[08:51:17] <gseguin> on the slide one?
[08:51:21] <toddparker> the left/right slide is NOT an overlap, just like master. it's a push
[08:51:26] <gseguin> that's ok
[08:51:33] <toddparker> the up/down is an overlap
[08:51:38] <gseguin> that was an easy fix
[08:51:41] <toddparker> cool
[08:51:55] <gseguin> but we're still working on kinks
[08:52:06] <toddparker> one thing i mentioned to scott is it would really cool if we could have dialogs truly overlay the page somehow
[08:52:12] <gseguin> it works on desktop safari but not on the iPad
[08:52:32] <toddparker> right now, when it animates to a separate page, it sort of loses the illustion of a dialog
[08:52:47] <gseguin> not sure what you mean
[08:52:53] <toddparker> but maybe that 's a different problem to solve from the core page transitions
[08:53:51] <scottjehl> hey all. Happy b2 :)
[08:55:26] <toddparker> my biggest beef with diolog is they don't feel right, esp. when you scroll
[08:55:28] <toddparker> go here
[08:55:29] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b2/#/demos/1.0b2/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html
[08:55:55] <toddparker> scroll down to the alt color scheme dialog button near the bottom on iphone
[08:56:11] <toddparker> click the link, it first scrolls up, then opens the dialog
[08:56:25] <toddparker> when you close the dialog, you're left back at the top of the page (!)
[08:56:44] * gseguin is trying it out
[08:56:47] <toddparker> ideally, the dialog would, be more of an overlay
[08:57:04] <gseguin> oh I see what you mean
[08:59:17] <gseguin> I'll try to address it after the page transitions
[09:08:32] <toddparker> scott is going to make a ticket with a proposed idea for how this should work. much easier than irc
[09:08:49] <scottjehl> I'm creating an issue now about what Todd just suggested. I think there are some smaller steps to getting there
[09:08:52] <scottjehl> jinx
[09:08:56] <scottjehl> :)
[09:09:08] <toddparker> you owe me a coke
[09:11:54] <kinblas> mornin' y'all
[09:19:05] <gseguin> hey kinblas
[09:19:19] <gseguin> so the slide looks like it's working fine now
[09:19:58] <_nickel> w00t
[09:20:02] <_nickel> new rig is new
[09:20:10] <gseguin> :)
[09:20:27] <_nickel> still a couple little things to get set up
[09:20:29] <_nickel> BUT
[09:20:43] <_nickel> since I have vagrant installed my jqm dev enironment is one command away :D
[09:20:52] * _nickel loves to automate
[09:23:15] * kinblas hears helicopters hovering above his building ... feels like he's in L.A.
[09:25:24] <scottjehl> ok, issues added https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2211
[09:25:34] <scottjehl> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2210
[09:26:16] <toddparker> kinblas - is o.j. going for a drive?
[09:26:46] <scottjehl> they kinda go together, but 2211 is the suggestion Todd just made, and 2210 is a lightweight path towards eliminating jump-to-top in our transitions (post-current-transitions branch changes)
[09:28:07] <toddparker> kinblas - those new issues are right up your alley. do you have time to look at them?
[09:28:08] <scottjehl> hey gseguin - we noticed the transitions are pushing pages together as they do in master now. Nice :)
[09:28:42] <scottjehl> gseguin: it seems that going "back" however, the pages overlapped instead of pushing. Not sure if that's still true
[09:29:03] <toddparker> kinblas- i also assigned you this one to add in position:fixed where supported: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1792
[09:29:10] <kinblas> scottjehl: you are testing on iOS right?
[09:29:21] <toddparker> we can fallback to the dynamic re-positioning behavior
[09:29:21] <scottjehl> that was in Chrome and iOS I believe
[09:29:34] <scottjehl> ...the overlap
[09:29:35] <gseguin> scottjehl: check http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/ for latest and greatest
[09:29:54] <scottjehl> cool yeah
[09:29:57] <scottjehl> still seeing that
[09:30:01] <scottjehl> go to a page, click back
[09:30:18] <gseguin> hmm
[09:30:22] <gseguin> weird
[09:30:23] <scottjehl> it does a wipe (which is cool, but a different transition)
[09:30:23] <kinblas> scottjehl: it works correctly on desktop
[09:30:25] <toddparker> mainly going back to home
[09:30:29] <gseguin> it's working here
[09:30:36] <toddparker> WUT?
[09:30:40] <toddparker> version of ios?
[09:30:42] <scottjehl> I'm in Chrome
[09:31:11] <scottjehl> ok to clarify - I only see it when going back to home
[09:31:20] <toddparker> ios 5 has the overlap on back
[09:31:20] <scottjehl> deeper pages do the correct transitions
[09:31:21] <gseguin> I'm using iPad with iOS 4.3.4
[09:31:44] <scottjehl> k... iPad probably only gets fade transitions in our docs anyway though, right?
[09:31:50] <scottjehl> by default
[09:31:58] <toddparker> 4.3.2 iphone sim also has this issue
[09:32:03] <scottjehl> yep
[09:32:07] <toddparker> yeah, you need to test on iphone
[09:32:20] <toddparker> what he said ^^
[09:32:48] <gseguin> does iPod touch count as iPhone?
[09:33:07] <toddparker> sure
[09:33:23] <gseguin> working
[09:34:06] <toddparker> really?
[09:34:10] <gseguin> yeah
[09:36:22] <gseguin> oh wait
[09:36:37] <gseguin> I missed that: "scottjehl: ok to clarify - I only see it when going back to home"
[09:36:41] <gseguin> let me try that
[09:36:44] <toddparker> i'm seeing it on my ios 5 iphone 4
[09:37:28] <toddparker> i also see the loader > blank page > new page transitions in from teh right
[09:37:34] <toddparker> they aren't joined
[09:37:44] <gseguin> yeah that I see
[09:37:45] <toddparker> maybe 500ms of a blank screen
[09:38:06] <gseguin> only on back though, right?
[09:38:24] <toddparker> nope. forward
[09:38:30] <gseguin> hmm
[09:39:01] <gseguin> oh very slim vertical gray bar
[09:39:05] <toddparker> on the original iphone running 3, it transitionsto a blank page then dies
[09:39:06] <gseguin> right?
[09:39:20] <gseguin> but on back it's a full gray page
[09:39:23] <toddparker> on /test/ there is a blank page for a flash, tehn it works
[09:39:51] <gseguin> ouch
[09:40:02] <gseguin> let me grab it
[09:40:12] <toddparker> no, on ios 5 latest build, there is a full screen of blankness for almost a full second
[09:40:17] <toddparker> then the new page slide in over it
[09:40:36] <toddparker> not black exactly, the bg color is there
[09:41:56] <gseguin> oh wow!
[09:42:03] <gseguin> iOS 3 is bad!
[09:42:32] <gseguin> and there I thought we were getting closer :(
[10:02:21] <_nickel> brb
[10:06:37] <toddparker> maybe kin will have some ideas. he is the master of transitions.
[10:07:21] <gseguin> toddmparker: although for my defense, it's not working very smoothly on iOS 3 with the current key-frames
[10:07:34] <gseguin> but at least it changing page :)
[10:07:48] <toddparker> yeah, exactly. not slick, work working
[10:15:06] <gseguin> brb
[10:15:12] * gseguin daily scrum
[10:15:13] <scottjehl> sorry, back. :)
[10:23:11] <toddparker> forgot our call is today
[10:28:21] <gseguin> and we're back
[10:29:58] * kinblas gets back from a firedrill
[10:30:17] <kinblas> heh they serve ice cream at our firedrills
[10:30:33] <kinblas> need to entice engineers to leave the bldg
[10:30:42] <gseguin> is it to make sure that everyone gets out?
[10:30:47] <gseguin> :)
[10:32:23] * kinblas finds out what the helicopters were about
[10:32:27] <kinblas> http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/san_francisco&id=8289010
[10:33:08] <_nickel> kinblas: and that is why they have harnesses
[10:33:19] <gseguin> oh wow!
[10:44:51] <gseguin> alright so I fixed the blank page on iOS 3, JS error, my bad
[10:45:01] <gseguin> but it still looks ugly
[11:04:20] <gseguin> toddparker: meeting?
[11:05:34] <toddparker> yep
[11:59:52] <scottjehl> download builder needs to be a priority soon too
[12:00:14] <scottjehl> even if it's just a rest API. Todd and I can build a UI for it in a snap
[12:10:07] <scottjehl> whew. lots going on! :)
[12:11:06] <_nickel> scottjehl: did you tell kin about the "nav on any page"
[12:11:27] <scottjehl> as in... jQMify that site?
[12:11:29] <scottjehl> :)
[12:12:10] <kinblas> eh?
[12:12:35] <scottjehl> gimme a minute, I'll get that example agin
[12:12:37] <scottjehl> again
[12:12:41] <kinblas> I leave you guys for a month and I come back all dis-combobulated and confused
[12:13:04] <toddparker> that's a good thing
[12:13:08] <toddparker> progress?
[12:13:28] <kinblas> yeah ... progress ... a month is too long to be out of the loop with you guys
[12:24:12] <toddparker> we could slow down?
[12:25:17] <scottjehl> kinblas
[12:25:34] <scottjehl> so, I set up a quick bookmarklet to demo how well our nav model works now
[12:25:37] <scottjehl> hat tip *
[12:26:12] <kinblas> uh huh
[12:26:27] <scottjehl> example. Go to a  site that isn't running jQM. http://filamentgroup.com
[12:26:52] <kinblas> there
[12:27:08] <scottjehl> k copying.. 1 sec
[12:27:33] <scottjehl> paste into address bar
[12:27:35] <scottjehl> javascript:(function(c,a){function b(e,f,g){g=c.createElement(f?"link":"script");if(f){g.rel="stylesheet"}g[f?"href":"src"]=e;a.insertBefore(g,a.firstChild);return g}b("http://jquerymobile.com/test/themes/default/jquery.mobile.core.css",true);b("http://jquerymobile.com/test/themes/default/jquery.mobile.transitions.css",true);var d=b("http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js");d.onload=function(
[12:27:35] <scottjehl> ){var e=b("http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js");e.onload=function(){alert("jQuery Mobile Loaded!")}}})(document,document.documentElement);
[12:27:44] <scottjehl> ugh. I'll gist it
[12:28:09] <scottjehl> https://gist.github.com/963f6647de078c759991
[12:28:11] <kinblas> eh that's ok
[12:28:34] <kinblas> hmmm was it supposed to do something?
[12:28:36] <kinblas> :-)
[12:28:54] <scottjehl> did it throw an alert?
[12:29:01] <scottjehl> if so, click one of the nav links
[12:29:21] <scottjehl> crap. bad paste it seems
[12:29:23] <kinblas> it didn't throw shizzle
[12:29:29] <scottjehl> one sec. repeating
[12:29:30] * _nickel double takes
[12:29:36] <_nickel> kinblas: did you just say shizzle?
[12:29:38] <scottjehl> (I swear - working here )
[12:29:38] <kinblas> lol
[12:29:43] <scottjehl> :)
[12:30:04] * kinblas tries in chrome
[12:30:30] <scottjehl> nah it's the gist hang on
[12:31:26] <kinblas> woah
[12:31:31] <kinblas> I got a dialog
[12:31:37] <kinblas> but a minute later
[12:32:07] <gseguin> https://gist.github.com/1126024
[12:32:39] <scottjehl> heh. okay. I need to make a bookmarklet link to make this easier
[12:33:02] <scottjehl> anyway, it'll bring most simple websites into our ajax model
[12:34:00] <scottjehl> part of making this happen is the page div itself is now optional
[12:34:45] <scottjehl> so our boilerplate markup has been reduced to pretty much just the links to our JS and CSS files. Beyond that, just make a website!
[12:34:49] <scottjehl> :)
[12:35:18] <kinblas> heh cool!
[12:35:33] <kinblas> bbiab
[12:35:46] <scottjehl> with pushstate enabled, it gets even cooler :)
[12:37:34] * _nickel is going to get his xp vm exported and working on his new lappy
[12:51:26] <gseguin> kinblas: I just pushed my last change to the transitions branch
[12:57:41] <scottjehl> here's a better version of the bookmarklet, with pushstate rolled in too http://filamentgroup.com/examples/jqmify/
[12:59:26] <scottjehl> not sure what sites it'll work on. At one point it could jqmify the nytimes :)
[12:59:39] <gseguin> scottjehl: back button doesn't work anymore
[12:59:52] <gseguin> I mean it changes the url
[13:00:01] <scottjehl> hmm yeah. weird
[13:00:02] <scottjehl> heh
[13:00:06] <gseguin> but no transition back to the previous page
[13:00:06] <scottjehl> ymmv
[13:00:10] <scottjehl> :)
[13:00:26] <scottjehl> oddly, back does work in the pushstate branch. one sec
[13:00:27] <gseguin> :)
[13:02:22] <scottjehl> brb
[13:19:00] <danielqb> Q: how I can remove the box number of sliders?
[13:34:21] <kinblas> gseguin: thanks, updating to pick up your changes
[13:36:37] <gseguin> you're welcome, good luck
[13:40:46] <gseguin> Any of you experiencing problems accessing http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js ?
[13:54:35] <todd_> gseguin - i commented on this bug. still seems off on my phone
[13:54:41] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1847#issuecomment-1730341
[13:55:01] <todd_> oh, just saw your reply.
[13:55:03] <todd_> odd
[13:58:18] <todd_> wonder what's up with that
[13:58:28] <todd_> are you seeing ~50 more padding on the right?
[13:58:35] <todd_> maybe it' just at the edge of fitting
[13:58:42] * gseguin looks
[13:59:28] <gseguin> it's more padding than on the left for sure
[13:59:58] <gseguin> if left is 15 then yeah it's ~50 on the right
[14:00:21] <todd_> talking to scott on this
[14:00:28] <gseguin> k
[14:00:29] <todd_> the issue is more with form elements in general
[14:00:34] <todd_> they only use 60%
[14:00:40] <todd_> but we shoudl change that to be 100%
[14:00:44] <scottjehl> the default padding is mostly there to accommodate different layouts, like when arrow and count bubble are there
[14:00:52] <todd_> maybe with the label at 40% of that
[14:01:01] <todd_> that will fix it
[14:01:12] <scottjehl> we just need some classes to qualify those states. then we can knock the default padding down to 15px
[14:01:46] <gseguin> so one class for count
[14:01:53] <todd_> so the rule is that stacked form elements (label above) are 100% width
[14:01:53] <scottjehl> form elements filling 100% is another issue entirely
[14:01:59] <gseguin> and one for arrow ?
[14:01:59] <scottjehl> but this issue exposes both together
[14:02:00] <todd_> when floated, together they fill 100%
[14:02:05] <todd_> yes
[14:02:10] <todd_> what scott said
[14:02:21] <todd_> another issue, but needed to solve this
[14:02:27] <scottjehl> also, forms in a UL = weird. there, said it
[14:02:30] <scottjehl> :)
[14:02:41] <todd_> within a read only list, we should check to see if there is extra right padding and remove that too
[14:02:49] <todd_> +1 on that too
[14:03:01] <todd_> but one of our most popular feates
[14:03:10] <todd_> so many issues filed when this didn't work
[14:03:12] <scottjehl> most people are looking for a horizontal rule between controls
[14:03:21] <todd_> people are trying to get the iphone prefs vibe going
[14:03:26] <todd_> that too
[14:03:29] <scottjehl> pretty easy to do without a UL/LI
[14:03:49] <todd_> but then they need to write (gasp) CSS
[14:03:50] <scottjehl> but anyway... we need examples I guess
[14:04:21] <todd_> wonder if read-only lists should use the flat bg color for a theme swatch
[14:04:36] <todd_> just nix the bg gradients? is that possible
[14:04:52] <scottjehl> hmm. we don't discover a list is readonly until parsing its LIs
[14:04:54] <todd_> odd to have dimensional read only lists IMHO
[14:05:00] <scottjehl> changing a theme at that point is kinda odd
[14:05:08] <todd_> ah
[14:05:25] <scottjehl> maybe we could add an option for readonly-theme
[14:05:31] <todd_> guess we could have a class or data- attr for read only
[14:06:09] <todd_> broken: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-readonly.html
[14:06:23] <todd_> the header styles anyway
[14:06:27] <gseguin> ouch
[14:09:41] <todd_> just needs some margin
[14:10:04] <gseguin> yeah that's what I saw
[14:10:05] <danielqb> Q: how I can remove the box number of sliders?
[14:13:53] <todd_> danielqb - that is a better question for the forums or jquerymobile channel. This is the team chat.
[14:14:20] <todd_> Short answer: inspect to find a selector and position it offscreen.
[14:16:32] <todd_> gseguin - fixed
[14:16:33] <todd_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-readonly.html
[14:16:49] <gseguin> man you're fast!
[14:17:01] <todd_> i hate that made it thru
[14:24:17] <todd_> Just updated this page too. Formatting was a bit off
[14:24:19] <todd_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/plugin-eventsmethods.html
[14:24:46] <todd_> just pushed
[14:31:16] <todd_> clean site for a conference: http://reliablesoftworks.com/DevCon2Go
[14:31:25] <todd_> uses mostly defaults, but feels nice
[14:31:42] <todd_> good use of search filter
[14:39:27] <_nickel> scottjehl: todd_: kinblas: gseguin: just a quick update, I double checked that our builds haven't been getting stalled on originates hudson and we had success 11 mins ago
[14:39:39] * _nickel likes a passing test suite :D
[14:39:46] <scottjehl> great
[14:39:48] <scottjehl> :)
[14:40:42] <_nickel> we're working on getting a vm setup at adobe for the same purpose.
[14:40:49] <_nickel> I'll probably end up setting up testswarm there as well
[14:44:38] <_nickel> ok time to land that callback
[14:44:47] <_nickel> kinblas: did I satisfy your concerns with the callback
[14:44:58] <_nickel> for listviewfiltering
[14:45:39] <kinblas> _nickel: I think as long as folks can have 2 different search listviews that use different functions we're ok
[14:45:45] <kinblas> did you post something I should've read somewhere?
[14:45:54] <_nickel> kinblas: nope, just referring to the meeting
[14:46:07] <kinblas> yeah as long as we can do the following:
[14:46:17] <_nickel>  yah
[14:46:27] <_nickel> changing it at runtime with a given instance of the widget
[14:46:29] <kinblas> 1. have a default search method that can be overridden and used for all search listviews
[14:46:36] <scottjehl> aand homebrew has been passed around FG for thursday beer hour, so consider yourselves warned. (commit messages may get hairy)
[14:46:42] <kinblas> 2. be able to specify per listview a method to use for the search
[14:46:54] <kinblas> scottjehl: lol
[14:47:00] <_nickel> nice
[14:47:39] * kinblas raises his glass of diet-pepsi ... cheers FG
[14:49:41] <_nickel> kinblas: if that completes the list I will promptly turn that into tests for my little branch
[14:50:30] <kinblas> sounds good
[14:50:47] * _nickel puts his headphones in
[14:50:56] * _nickel crac
[14:51:01] <_nickel> ...
[14:51:12] * _nickel cracks his knuckles
[15:15:29] <gseguin> _nickel: how about creating a git directory in jqm root with the pre-commit hook, its config files and a setup scripts that installs it?
[15:15:54] <_nickel> gseguin: I was considering that but I'd ask for the others to agree that they actually want that there
[15:15:58] <gseguin> *setup script (there will be only one)
[15:16:06] <_nickel> we also need to work out the issue with heroku spinnup time :(
[15:16:28] <gseguin> hmm, have you tried the joyent smart machine?
[15:18:17] <_nickel> newp
[15:18:18] <_nickel> is it free?
[15:18:27] <gseguin> yep
[15:18:39] <gseguin> but you need to be invited
[15:18:44] <_nickel> ah!
[15:18:45] <_nickel> well
[15:18:53] <_nickel> if you have access and it doesn't have a spinup time that would be hot
[15:19:33] <_nickel> kinblas: everything is working as expected
[15:19:41] <gseguin> I'll give it a try
[15:19:57] <scottjehl> hey I'm gonna delete htaccess - any gripes?
[15:20:08] <scottjehl> it's been empty for a week or so...
[15:20:32] <_nickel> kinblas: per the widget docs $("#mylist").listview('options', 'filterCallback')
[15:20:37] <_nickel> scottjehl: fine with me
[15:20:45] <_nickel> kinblas: that will return the callback
[15:20:59] <_nickel> $("#mylist").listview('options', 'filterCallback', function(){});
[15:21:01] <_nickel> sets it
[15:21:04] <scottjehl> we could always add it to .gitignore if ppl want to keep them in their repos
[15:25:26] <toddparker> oh, just remembered: we need to clean up our repo
[15:25:31] <toddparker> it's huge
[15:25:40] <toddparker> from the history apparently
[15:26:00] <toddparker> we discussed cleaning this up a while back
[15:26:08] <toddparker> not sure anything happened tho
[15:26:12] <toddparker> any volunteers
[15:27:23] <_nickel> toddparker: hmm
[15:27:29] <_nickel> toddparker: it shouldn't be too huge
[15:27:53] <_nickel> unless we have a ton of branches that have been continuously pulling from master over time
[15:28:02] <_nickel> which I suppose is possible
[15:28:12] <_nickel> otherwise when you branch its a just a pointer to the ancestor commit
[15:29:17] <_nickel> toddparker: have you done a `git gc` lately?
[15:29:34] <_nickel> scottjehl: kinblas: gseguin: ^
[15:29:47] <gseguin> never
[15:30:21] <kinblas> what is that?
[15:30:38] <kinblas> garbage collect?
[15:30:39] <_nickel> its cleans up gits internal representation
[15:30:42] <_nickel> yes
[15:30:54] <kinblas> ah ok throwing away un referenced comits from dead branches?
[15:31:08] <scottjehl> speaking of dead branches...
[15:31:11] <scottjehl> :)
[15:31:16] <kinblas> I removed one yesterday :-P
[15:31:23] <scottjehl> nice!
[15:31:27] <toddparker> i certainly didn't do that. i live in illustrator and barely use smartgit
[15:31:37] <_nickel> kinblas: scottjehl: toddparker: gseguin: http://progit.org/book/ch9-7.html
[15:31:46] <toddparker> bender - you wanna be our gc guy?
[15:31:47] <kinblas> scottjehl: that reminds me
[15:31:52] <kinblas> I should branch the scrollview
[15:32:34] <toddparker> you know what a tarball is, apparently
[15:32:50] <toddparker> my cat spit one up a few days ago.
[15:32:53] <_nickel> toddparker: you just run it locally
[15:32:57] <toddparker> grep it, it's a nerd joke!
[15:33:09] <_nickel> ...
[15:33:09] <_nickel> lol
[15:33:29] <toddparker> strong homebrew, scottjehl
[15:33:30] <_nickel> garbage cleanup on github is github's problem
[15:33:35] <toddparker> ah
[15:33:41] <_nickel> scottjehl: was this the stuff you were tweeting about a while back?
[15:33:41] <scottjehl> no kidding, eh?
[15:33:45] <toddparker> someone complained about how huge our repo is
[15:33:48] <gseguin> lol
[15:33:59] <toddparker> 100mb?
[15:34:10] <scottjehl> _nickel: what were we tweeting about?
[15:34:21] <kinblas> lol
[15:34:21] <toddparker> tarballz?
[15:34:26] <kinblas> and the beer takes effect
[15:34:30] <scottjehl> oh boy
[15:34:42] <_nickel> scottjehl: you were making beer
[15:34:47] <_nickel> and you said it would take a while
[15:34:53] <_nickel> I think it was on the 4th
[15:35:03] <scottjehl> they don't call it imperial for nothing
[15:35:06] <toddparker> we're drinking it now. it's in alpha.
[15:35:15] <toddparker> it's DELICIOUS
[15:35:17] <gseguin> oh it's your 4th-of-brewly!
[15:35:25] <scottjehl> yes it is. indeed
[15:35:32] <kinblas> hey guys in my reply to Dave Methvin ... excuse the english
[15:35:37] <toddparker> scott is the brewmaster
[15:35:42] <kinblas> I shouldn't write, then re-arrange text in a hurry
[15:35:52] <toddparker> heh. thanks for responding
[15:35:58] <toddparker> glad he's watching out for us
[15:36:08] <kinblas> heh it might make sense to you FG guys right about now though
[15:36:34] <gseguin> :)
[15:36:43] <scottjehl> and by "alpha", I suspect you're referring to the alpha-acidity, which is quite high for an IPA and okay I should probably not be on the internet right now
[15:37:46] <scottjehl> http://scottjehl.com/i/noregrets.gif
[15:38:30] <_nickel> kinblas: yah I had some issues articulating as well :(
[15:38:43] <gseguin> _nickel: should we install a pre-commit hook to protect against intoxicated commits?
[15:38:47] <_nickel> kinblas: my dom relationships POC sets data attributes after the fact frequnitly
[15:39:05] <_nickel> gseguin: lol "please blow into the usb breathalizer before proceeding"
[15:39:16] <kinblas> heh
[15:39:31] <_nickel> *frequently
[15:40:27] <scottjehl> well, for one, we set data-url programmatically on every page.
[15:40:32] <scottjehl> so that'll break
[15:40:53] <scottjehl> which might just take the whole ship down with it
[15:41:05] <toddparker> who's been drinking beer 'cause scott's the only one making sense here
[15:41:09] <scottjehl> http://scottjehl.com/i/enterprise.gif
[15:41:39] <gseguin> lol
[15:43:37] <kinblas> scottjehl: we use the jqmData() to set/get
[15:43:40] <kinblas> don't we?
[15:43:49] <kinblas> no attribute involved there
[15:44:23] <scottjehl> hmm. you could be right on that, yeah
[15:44:48] <scottjehl> also, to Dave's recent reply: I don't think we ever retrieve the entire object internally
[15:45:00] <scottjehl> but jqmData is meant to do that when called with no arguments
[15:45:07] <scottjehl> so that could break, in theory
[15:45:34] <_nickel> gseguin: kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2216
[15:46:40] * gseguin looks
[15:47:26] <scottjehl> _nickel http://scottjehl.com/i/thumbsdown.gif
[15:47:35] <scottjehl> ...okay time for me to leave
[15:47:43] <scottjehl> :)
[15:47:47] * _nickel brandishes his fist
[15:47:49] <_nickel> scottjehl: lol
[15:47:59] <_nickel> scottjehl: I'm bummed I'd love to try some of the beer
[15:48:30] <gseguin> come up here we have 2 kegs
[15:48:31] <scottjehl> ah, well I have enough to save... not sure whether I'll be around for jQCon though.
[15:48:39] <_nickel> lol
[15:48:46] <scottjehl> I can leave some in the FG fridge for you :)
[15:48:47] <_nickel> probably wasted on me
[15:48:48] <toddparker> i'll get us some bud ice for the conf
[15:48:52] <_nickel> I'm not a beer expert
[15:48:55] <_nickel> toddparker: lol
[15:49:02] <_nickel> toddparker: I'll stick with the water
[15:49:31] <toddparker> good call
[15:50:25] <_nickel> gseguin: if you're fine with it you can merge and we can go talk with those guys about using their code in an example
[15:50:39] <gseguin> _nickel: yeah it looks good
[15:50:39] <_nickel> ah
[15:50:49] <_nickel> I need to add info to the docs
[15:50:50] <_nickel> brb
[15:50:51] <gseguin> the only thing is coding standards in the test
[15:50:54] <toddparker> i like that idea
[15:50:55] <toddparker> yeap
[15:51:22] <toddparker> i think having some pre-packaged examples of their advanced filtering on a page would be great
[15:51:54] <toddparker> rwaldron will come down on that like a ton of bricks
[15:52:05] <toddparker> conform
[15:52:16] * rwaldron nods
[15:52:18] <rwaldron> btw
[15:52:22] <rwaldron> if anyone is interested
[15:52:26] <rwaldron> (unrelated)
[15:52:34] <rwaldron> ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/try-builds/tmielczarek@mozilla.com-8df56f741a66/
[15:52:39] <rwaldron> grab one of those builds
[15:52:39] <gseguin> and he's got a light saber so beware!
[15:52:47] <rwaldron> and xbox controller drivers
[15:52:59] <rwaldron> and dig this
[15:52:59] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/wPuGB/
[15:53:00] <rwaldron> :D
[15:53:11] <toddparker> wowie
[15:53:12] <rwaldron> mozilla just released a build with "joystick" events
[15:53:31] <rwaldron> toddparker you should come by bocoup sometime this week and check it out
[15:53:50] <_nickel> gseguin: I'll get that too
[15:53:54] <toddparker> sounds cool
[15:54:04] <toddparker> alright, i gotta jet
[15:54:42] <scottjehl> same. talk to you all tomorrow!
[15:57:35] <_nickel> gseguin: updated with the last test guidlines, though the whole file needs a runthrought
[15:57:39] <_nickel> -t
[15:58:43] <gseguin> you missed some, but that's being picky
[15:58:52] <gseguin> go for it
[16:08:30] <gseguin> _nickel: http://ghislain.no.de/jshint
[16:10:05] <_nickel> gseguin: that pull request includes the docs now too
[16:11:46] <gseguin> _nickel: it looks good
[16:12:38] <gseguin> _nickel: do you want me to press the button?
[16:12:40] <_nickel> gseguin: super super nice
[16:12:44] <_nickel> gseguin: sure!
[16:12:49] <_nickel> the hard part is working with those guys
[16:13:06] <gseguin> which guys?
[16:13:12] <_nickel> gseguin: from issue 2006
[16:13:19] <_nickel> so much effort put in :(
[16:13:42] <gseguin> oh I know, I feel bad for them
[16:13:57] <gseguin> but hey, it's the right way to go I think
[16:14:00] <_nickel> gseguin: do you have any problems with me puting your jshint url in the jshint-service repo as an option, obviously having no spinup time is pretty awesome
[16:14:11] <gseguin> and they were going to implement it anyway
[16:14:25] <gseguin> now they just will implement it privately
[16:14:54] <gseguin> so I don't know about the spin-up time
[16:14:56] <gseguin> yet
[16:15:17] <_nickel> it seems to be working just fine to me
[16:15:18] <gseguin> do you see it immediately on heroku?
[16:15:23] <_nickel> no
[16:15:24] <_nickel> it failes
[16:15:29] <_nickel> because we include a timeout
[16:15:36] <_nickel> fails > failes
[16:15:39] <_nickel> ugh
[16:16:06] <_nickel> heroku is pretty aggressive with spinning down app instances when they aren't seeing traffic
[16:16:15] <gseguin> go for it, update the jshint-service repo to point at my instance
[16:16:41] <_nickel> I just have them as commented options
[16:16:46] <gseguin> I was going to use it for that anyway
[16:17:23] <gseguin> the only thing I've changed is that I don't run it on the root
[16:17:48] <gseguin> to make room for other projects
[16:18:02] <_nickel> gseguin: done
[16:18:27] <_nickel> gseguin: cool
[16:18:45] <_nickel> brb
[16:35:33] <_nickel> gseguin: did you close the other issue that was opened by jeffholmes
[16:35:38] <_nickel> it sounded like those two were related
[16:35:52] <_nickel> also I posted on the issue too to give them the reasoning behind going the callback route
[16:36:08] <_nickel> I figure I owed them that after diving in and ruining the party
[18:24:07] <gseguin> back
[18:24:25] <gseguin> _nickel: I haven't closed the other pull request yet, will do
[18:30:33] <gseguin> _nickel: done
