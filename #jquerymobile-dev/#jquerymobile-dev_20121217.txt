[05:12:04] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[05:12:18] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:12:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: u were on a tear this weekend. Pushing for 250 lol?
[05:13:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah ... OCD ;-)
[05:13:48] <arschmitz> it was below last night has gone back up though
[05:15:02] <uGoMobi> yes, somebody had the nerves to find a bug ;-)
[05:15:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5385 i cant replicate on ios but can on chrome
[05:15:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so im guessing its related to mouseup
[05:15:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so it on Chrome too
[05:16:09] <uGoMobi> I didn't look into it, only cleanup his markup
[05:17:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi sorry i somehow pasted wrong link
[05:17:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3803 is what i was actually talking about
[05:18:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, there were multiple issues about taphold / tap so I guess there is something wrong
[05:19:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think its specific to desktop though guessing its related to mouseup 
[05:19:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im looking into it right now
[05:19:52] <uGoMobi> I have to focus on a project there rest of the day... will be working on JQM again tomorrow
[05:20:07] <uGoMobi> demos mostly
[05:20:28] <uGoMobi> but we could probably finish range slider / slider stuff this week too
[05:20:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think its pretty solid just needs some css tweaks
[05:21:19] <arschmitz> ill double check iv pushed my latest changes so you can check it out when ever you have time
[05:21:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool
[05:22:15] <uGoMobi> ok, I go back in my cave :)
[05:22:32] <arschmitz> ok watch out for bats
[05:24:22] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:07:27] <toddmparker> morning
[07:07:37] <toddmparker> 259 issues! woo hoo.
[07:16:28] <arschmitz> 249 you mean?
[07:16:44] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker
[07:17:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker: well actually back up to 250 now but ill close one in a minute lol just wanted your oppinion first 
[07:23:39] <toddmparker> sure, shoot
[07:25:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3803 do you think tap should still be fired on taphold
[07:26:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker: in his comment johnbender: kinda indicates hes not sure he agrees its an issue but he can reproduce
[07:27:19] <arschmitz> toddmparker: its an easy fix i just want to make sure we want to fix
[07:31:45] <toddmparker> arschmitz: ok, asking some of the filamenters for opinions
[07:32:11] <toddmparker> so the Q is whether we should go back to the 1.0 style where taphold doesn't also fire tap, right?
[07:32:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ok the taphold has always fired tap
[07:32:42] <arschmitz> toddmparkereven pre 1.0
[07:34:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker: so i guess the question really is is this a bug or just how things work with those events
[07:40:54] <toddmparker> arschmitz: not sure. scottjehl__ isn't either
[07:41:23] <toddmparker> though it seems like more than a few people chimed in on that issue saying they wanted it to not fire tap
[07:42:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah its tough because its always been this way
[07:42:44] <arschmitz> so people could be counting on it now
[07:43:07] <arschmitz> toddmparker: and the name tap hold would almost indicate it would fire tap since its tap hold
[07:43:56] <arschmitz> toddmparker: but i think we should probably just pick one way or the other and document it
[07:46:49] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i suppose the compromise for this would be keep it as is but make it a global config option to turn the tap event off
[07:47:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker: when tap hold is fired that is
[07:48:55] <toddmparker> yeah
[07:49:21] <toddmparker> maybe we should add a new event so you could use either taphold + tap or just taphold
[07:49:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: that would work too
[07:50:53] <scottjehl__> fwiw, it doesn't seem unexpected to me that tap and taphold fire on a taphold
[07:51:20] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: i agree which is why i brought up the question 
[07:51:21] <scottjehl__> but I guess if it's a change since 1.0, that'd be unexpected to those using it
[07:51:40] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: its not a change since 1.0 its always been this way
[07:52:11] <scottjehl__> those binding to tap likely don't care how long the user holds down. Taphold is a type of a tap, I think anyway
[07:52:38] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: i agree by its name taphold i would expect it to still fire tap
[07:53:24] <toddmparker> so if you guys think this is expected and it's always worked this way, I say we close
[07:53:28] <toddmparker> and just document it
[07:54:07] <arschmitz> toddmparker: sounds good to me, if we get too many complaints we can always create a second event or add a global config option for it
[07:55:06] <toddmparker> sure. one issue down then.
[07:57:17] <arschmitz> toddmparker: One other thing i wanted to show you is something i started over the weekend
[07:57:27] <arschmitz> http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/faq/docs/demos/faq/
[07:57:49] <arschmitz> toddmparker: most of the pages arnt there yet only the very first one is but you get the idea
[08:04:19] <toddmparker> that is awesome
[08:04:31] <toddmparker> topics from your deck?
[08:04:45] <arschmitz> Yeah i thought it would make a good faq
[08:04:56] <arschmitz> we can add to it but those were a good starting point
[08:05:10] <toddmparker> really like this idea
[08:05:21] <arschmitz> i think most of the time people dont know where in the docs to look for their answers
[08:05:35] <toddmparker> right
[08:05:40] <arschmitz> all the answers for most of these are there people just dont know it
[08:05:54] <toddmparker> and putting in the format of what you're trying to do or what isn't working is great
[08:05:56] <arschmitz> but if we had a nice FAQ people would look here before filing an issue a lot more often
[08:06:02] <toddmparker> I bet we could get a lot of contributions
[08:06:15] <toddmparker> this is a format people can easily add to
[08:06:31] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah we could get a really healthy resource going with it and having it searchable helps too
[08:06:47] <toddmparker> i bet we could move a lot of our docs into this format
[08:06:53] <toddmparker> right
[08:06:58] <arschmitz> and we can have examples and link to demos etc 
[08:07:27] <toddmparker> i really like this
[08:07:40] <arschmitz> link to resources and for things like extensions (hash change plugin subpage plugin etc)
[08:07:43] <toddmparker> i know a bunch of people who could contribute topics
[08:07:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: awesome
[08:07:56] <toddmparker> based on articles they've written in the past
[08:08:17] <arschmitz> and whenever we find an issue that seems approriate we can add it to the list
[08:08:32] <toddmparker> we can comb thru the docs and look for stuff to make a FAQ out of
[08:08:44] <toddmparker> how do i hide the label on a form
[08:08:48] <toddmparker> etc.
[08:09:01] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah thats part of what i did for my preso to 
[08:09:11] <toddmparker> nice
[08:09:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker: and i thought just make it like the first thiing in the demo docs and link from the homepage
[08:09:27] <toddmparker> we could always look thru issues and the forum for topics once we get caught up
[08:09:39] <arschmitz> so people can find it and know its there
[08:09:41] <toddmparker> this allows us to cover a lot of different topics
[08:10:00] <toddmparker> so maybe we just have the widgets, real-world demos and faqs
[08:10:16] <toddmparker> maybe we'll end up calling it a dev guide or something like that
[08:10:17] <arschmitz> toddmparker: what i did for now is this http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/faq/docs/demos/
[08:10:41] <toddmparker> we'll need to tweak styles to allow the test to wrap on this or they'll all get truncated
[08:11:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i only spent like 20 minutes on it so far
[08:11:18] <arschmitz> just to set up a basic idea of what i was thinking
[08:11:35] <toddmparker> think we need a high level nav
[08:12:15] <toddmparker> intro  |  widgets  |  demos  |  faqs
[08:12:21] <toddmparker> or something like that
[08:12:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i agree
[08:12:33] <toddmparker> be fun to hash out ideas of this with uGoMobi 
[08:12:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i was going to mention to him this morning but he said hes busy today
[08:12:58] <toddmparker> right now that FQA link looks like a header for the list below
[08:13:04] <toddmparker> FAQ
[08:13:37] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i agree i was trying to make it stand out / make sense but i dont think this is the answer
[08:13:52] <arschmitz> it was just to get a link there for now untill we did something better
[08:14:24] <arschmitz> actually i think even its own seperate button would be better then that ha ha 
[08:16:36] <toddmparker> it's ok if this is messy right now, we're just collecting stuff
[08:17:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i made it a button it already is better ha ha 
[08:17:34] <toddmparker> cool
[08:18:37] <toddmparker> arschmitz: once you get the FAQ in better shape, you can land that in master. Looks like they are all pages in a folder, right?
[08:18:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yes
[08:18:55] <toddmparker> ok
[08:19:08] <toddmparker> the 3 stacked bars needs some style love
[08:19:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah need more then one of the q's linked linked first
[08:19:20] <toddmparker> but if these are classed up, we can do whatever
[08:19:23] <arschmitz> toddmparker yeah it needs work for sure
[08:19:26] <arschmitz> they are
[08:21:23] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ill push it to a branch when i finish it up a little more  and work with uGoMobi to get it looking better
[08:21:31] <arschmitz> then push it to master
[08:25:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker: after what you were saying firday i thought you would like this concept. 
[08:26:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ill still do a write up on the ajax nav and page event stuff too like you wanted when i get some time. that part of things didnt really make sense in this
[08:28:07] <toddmparker> i think we can have real articles covering major themes
[08:28:16] <toddmparker> then use this for all the detailed stuff
[08:29:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker:yeah that was my thinking thats why i left all that stuff out of that list

[08:48:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you there?
[08:48:38] <johnbender> toddmparker: arschmitz: uGoMobi: I'm going to merge the simple-nav-merge branch
[08:48:48] <johnbender> the tests will be broken
[08:48:55] <johnbender> but I talked with _|Nix|_ about it
[08:52:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: oh well gota break something before you can fix it :)
[08:53:00] <johnbender> :)
[08:53:09] <johnbender> I want to get started on better unit testing
[08:53:26] <johnbender> for the new nav stuff
[08:53:38] <johnbender> so we can keep that process tight with new stuff/refactors
[08:54:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: nice 
[08:55:11] <johnbender> I'm also thinking about the final shape of the navigation API
[08:56:55] <arschmitz> yeah api shape is super important before release
[08:57:10] <arschmitz> because after that we are stuck with it for a long time if we dont like something
[08:57:12] <johnbender> arschmitz: most likely it'll stay very similar for this release
[08:57:17] <johnbender> just a method and an event
[08:57:24] <johnbender> but if we want to expose the functionality for extension
[08:57:29] <johnbender> then it needs to be less shitty
[08:58:08] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah and i think the ability to extend things like nav is really important
[08:58:27] <johnbender> right now its just $.navigate and the navigate event
[08:58:31] <johnbender> that seems reasonable
[08:58:40] <johnbender> though you could make a case for a different method name
[08:58:52] <arschmitz> johnbender: the more ability we give for people to extend things the less options and things we need to support internally
[08:59:10] <johnbender> arschmitz: 6 of one half-dozen of the other
[08:59:15] <johnbender> but it forces us to suck less
[08:59:17] <johnbender> as devs
[08:59:27] <johnbender> if we have to expose it
[09:00:12] <johnbender> that is we're tied to it either way
[09:00:18] <johnbender> probably more so the more we document
[09:00:24] <johnbender> but at least that way the internals have to be nice
[09:00:33] <arschmitz> johnbender: true 
[09:00:44] <toddmparker> johnbender: big day
[09:00:49] <johnbender> toddmparker: seriously

[09:07:46] <Wilto> (Nice.)
[09:08:37] <johnbender> if we have to deal with failing tests over a long period of time I'll disable the alerts
[09:08:40] <johnbender> we'll see
[09:15:18] <toddmparker> congrats johnbender 
[09:15:27] <toddmparker> fix fit. fix it.
[09:15:30] <johnbender> :)
[09:16:24] <johnbender> toddmparker: well nevermind
[09:16:30] <johnbender> we just got a green fucking test run out of it
[09:17:42] <toddmparker> WAT
[09:17:53] <johnbender> toddmparker: gabriel took care of the last bit I think
[09:17:56] <johnbender> wasn't nav associated
[09:18:15] <johnbender> toddmparker: also I think this remedies the failures we were getting in his sequence tests
[09:18:26] <johnbender> since it removes the delay crap we had with hashchange/pushstate
[09:18:47] <johnbender> device testing is going to be key though

[09:40:40] <toddmparker> getting this into master will really help with testing
[09:40:52] <toddmparker> and if we can get a beta out in the next 2 weeks, even better
[09:41:01] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah
[09:41:11] <johnbender> that's why I decided to just hack it in after a point
[09:41:15] <toddmparker> tip: don't plan on a beta around the holidays
[09:41:22] <toddmparker> for next year
[09:41:36] <toddmparker> by whatever means necessary
[09:42:07] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i was thinking about the bad timeing of this this weekend lol
[09:42:22] <arschmitz> toddmparker: at least its a beta not a final lol
[09:53:18] <toddmparker> right. we'll see how it goes. we can always push it in early January. still quite a few widgets in the not-quite-done-state
[09:53:37] <toddmparker> big panel push happening today. we've been re-factoring that for over a week now. crazy.
[09:57:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker: the js side of range is done uGoMobi: said he should be able to take a look tomorrow
[09:57:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker: at the js
[09:58:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker: doh too many converstation at the css
[10:05:36] <toddmparker> ah, ok. great. hoping to wrap up panels today. but i've been saying hat for a week.

[11:32:58] <toddmparker> I haven't researched it, but it does just seem like an odd rendering bug
[11:33:14] <toddmparker> feel like I saw something like that on some flavor of Android too
[11:33:32] <agcolom> interesting! 
[11:33:35] <toddmparker> we might be able to force a re-render or something to make it behave
[11:33:52] <toddmparker> let's keep it open and see if we can fix it
[11:34:01] <toddmparker> mind tagging it to 1.3?
[11:34:10] <agcolom> sure
[11:34:20] <toddmparker> thanks!
[11:34:35] <toddmparker> how is everything going? seems like a crazy time for you

[12:00:00] <johnbender> working on unit tests now
[12:00:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nice!
[12:00:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was thinking: We should move the URL manipulation inside $.navigate.
[12:00:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: changePage and popup shouldn't be calculating what the URL should be.
[12:00:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: correct!
[12:00:55] <johnbender> later though
[12:00:58] <johnbender> that will break everything
[12:01:08] <johnbender> and we might have to deprecate stuff
[12:01:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Why would that break everything?
[12:01:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm sure tests would break
[12:01:35] <johnbender> and people use changePage directly
[12:01:48] <johnbender> so we'd have to deprecate some of that behavior
[12:01:53] <johnbender> or work around it
[12:01:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we just got it working
[12:02:11] <johnbender> so I'd rather shore things up a bit with some unit tests
[12:02:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think that's fine, because I was also thinking about creating another option for $.navigate: Call it "deepLink: true/false".
[12:02:19] <johnbender> and then go back to fixing up the internals after a release
[12:02:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: role = popup/dialog would result in deepLink: false, otherwise true.
[12:02:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nav would be unaware of roles.
[12:03:18] <johnbender> well the new stuff doesn't care about roles
[12:03:23] <johnbender> that's all in changePage still
[12:03:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's good.
[12:03:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I did my best to keep the ugliness down in the old code
[12:03:55] <johnbender> there's still some ugly bits in the new stuff though
[12:03:59] <johnbender> that's why I'm working on unit tests
[12:04:02] <johnbender> so I can clean that up some
[12:04:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, I think that whole check-if-reused-dialog-state, check-if-initial-url-has-hashkey stuff can be moved inside $.navigate and activated with deepLink: false.
[12:04:45] <johnbender> I'd rather not
[12:04:56] <johnbender> $.navigate has a really simple purpose
[12:05:02] <johnbender> track history
[12:05:16] <johnbender> honestly it shouldn't even support direct hash manipulation
[12:05:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. .Fair.
[12:05:21] <johnbender> but I added that in out of necessity
[12:05:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that way people can use it without using jqm
[12:05:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We could come up with a utility then.
[12:05:52] <johnbender> and carry as little code as possible
[12:06:17] <_|Nix|_> $.navigate( computeUrl( url, { deepLink: true/false } ), navigateOptions );

[12:24:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Problem: page1 -> dialog -> page2 <- back -> forward. It refuses to go back to page2.
[12:24:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I don't think I have that one in the sequence tests.
[12:25:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: kk, go ahead and add it, I'll take a look
[12:25:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Also, after opening a dialog/popup from page1 and going back, the url for page1 has a trailing #.
[12:25:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the sequence you describe there would go back to page1 anyway no?
[12:26:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The forward should cause it to go to page2, skipping past the stale dialog state.
[12:26:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah, that's different ok
[12:26:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can you push those to a branch and I'll take a look?

[12:26:55] <johnbender> *yah
[12:26:57] <_|Nix|_> OK.

[13:35:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you still here?
[13:35:59] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper! 
[13:36:09] <agcolom> I have a question for you
[13:36:11] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom 
[13:36:15] <uGoMobi> sure
[13:36:56] <agcolom> you know for the api docs, we said that I should merge Header + Footer + Content into Page.sections widget
[13:37:10] <agcolom> (curently I have all 3 separate)
[13:37:18] <uGoMobi> right
[13:37:27] <uGoMobi> is that the convention?
[13:37:38] <agcolom> but in the js file, I cannot find any sign of the Page.sections 
[13:37:39] <uGoMobi> sort by widget, not by component?
[13:38:06] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/page.sections.js
[13:38:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm here.
[13:38:14] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[13:38:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[13:38:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I saw you were looking for me this weekend
[13:38:49] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, but do they have all the same options/events/methods?
[13:38:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks
[13:38:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Egads ... I can't remember what for ...
[13:38:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so I thougt I let you know I am here :)
[13:39:04] <agcolom> (I'm wondering whether it wouldn't be best to keep them separate)
[13:39:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I remember!
[13:39:17] <agcolom> Hey Gabriel :-)
[13:39:23] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hey!
[13:39:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Have my changes improved performance at all?
[13:39:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can't seem to notice much of an improvement.
[13:39:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: header/footer have same option
[13:40:09] <agcolom> ok that's a good start :-)
[13:40:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: probably hard to see on desktop, but it looked good
[13:40:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think content has only option "theme" (data-theme)
[13:40:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There is another level of laziness we could do: create the popup on-the-fly and destroy it when it gets closed.
[13:41:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am happy with the changes you made
[13:41:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That way we do not inflate the DOM with lots of screens/containers.
[13:41:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: were on or two minor issues but all working fine now
[13:41:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good idea
[13:42:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^ is all the excuse I need to get cracking on it :)
[13:42:11] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:42:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe should first look at the repositioning
[13:42:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's kinda ugly
[13:42:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good point.
[13:43:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you suggested to copy and edit the popupbeforeposition code, right?
[13:43:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, I'm thinking maybe popup could use a .reposition() method ...
[13:44:17] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, while you're here, could I please check with you what are all the options/methods and events for the page.sections?
[13:44:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: BTW - is there a way you can mention that content and header/footer belong to page.section widget but list them seperated
[13:44:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then again, maybe not ... let's see ...

[13:44:25] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06slide-panel-refactor 14b6fe5bc 15Scott Jehl: animated-in a box shadow after transition for reveal and overlay
[13:44:33] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes
[13:45:11] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Maybe we could keep them separate and also have the page.sections entry as a generic thing, a bit like what we did with tables?
[13:45:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sure, they are in the document _|Nix|_ created
[13:45:39] <agcolom> uGoMobi: perfect! Do you have the link (please :-) )
[13:46:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good idea, I agree that they differ that much that it make sense to not list them as page.sections
[13:46:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n7ozvhQTLhBj6sPR-LYxuev3p8kcbHjlAM8EBMlQ8GE/edit
[13:46:59] <uGoMobi> that are the options
[13:47:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I also noticed issues with the regex for CSS
[13:47:52] <agcolom> fantastic! This is awesome! I'll try to remember to print this tomorrow at work! It'll be great to double check everything!
[13:48:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: some class names etc are styled as values
[13:48:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: let me check methods
[13:48:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't understand. "regex for CSS"?
[13:49:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the regex that syntax highlighter uses for the CSS
[13:49:33] <uGoMobi> aka "CSS brush"
[13:49:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh. Maybe we should file an issue against SyntaxHighlighter.
[13:49:59] <agcolom> uGoMobi: otherwise, we could have the signle page.sections entry and specify for some of the options something like: only applicable to the header section 
[13:51:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, but the dev of that tool doesn't seem to update often... already opened an issue there for something else
[13:51:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this is an example... http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/tables/phone-compare.html see the CSS

[13:51:58] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06slide-panel-refactor 14900632b 15Scott Jehl: fixed the overlay right shadow
[13:53:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, but almost all options are only for header/footer... not sure what's best here
[13:53:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I like consistency in how we document but header/footer is different from content
[13:53:57] <agcolom> maybe toddmparker can advise on what's best?
[13:54:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You mean the h8
[13:55:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: also, fixedToolbars is a seperate widget
[13:55:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Gah!
[13:55:10] <agcolom> yes!
[13:55:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah the h1-6 elements but also the class names at the bottom
[13:56:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the class names contain keywords like hidden and visible and those are highlighted
[13:57:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Understood.
[13:58:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't think page.sections has methods
[13:58:31] <uGoMobi> we don't even have a refresh method for this (yet)
[13:58:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, I guess we can fix that and submit an issue, and it'll be fixed whenever.
[13:59:02] <agcolom> ok, and do we have events other than create?
[13:59:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah 
[13:59:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, not sure if we should mess with the regex - maybe we'll break something else.
[13:59:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think I've spotted the issue with the new test
[13:59:17] <johnbender> that is, what's causing the failure
[13:59:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Great!
[13:59:23] <johnbender> there's nothing wrong with the new test
[13:59:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Good to hear :)
[13:59:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true, difficult stuff... I can't work on regex longer than an hour or i get an headache ;)
[14:00:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I have another failed sequence, but I'll wait for your fix, because the root cause might be the same.
[14:00:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: might be
[14:00:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: going back to the initial state in the page requies that we replaceState on it
[14:00:32] <johnbender> so that the history information is available
[14:00:48] <uGoMobi> agcolom: no, no events either
[14:00:56] <johnbender> otherwise it get's treated as though someone is manipulating the hash directly
[14:01:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that is, we need to replace state on the initial url
[14:02:08] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Cool! Thanks a lot. I'm tempted to merge them in that case as initially suggested... I'll check with toddmparker before just to be sure...
[14:02:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom:  ok cool!
[14:02:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: bingo
[14:02:56] <johnbender> need to make sure it doesn't break all the other tests though
[14:03:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: these sequence tests are a nice bellweather
[14:04:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am not even sure if page.sections has a create event
[14:05:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you check what I just ^^^ said to agcolom ? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/page.sections.js
[14:05:40] <agcolom> uGoMobi:  I thought it did because of $( document ).bind( "pagecreate create", function( e ) {
[14:05:40] <agcolom> 	$( ":jqmData(role='fieldcontain')", e.target ).jqmEnhanceable().fieldcontain();
[14:05:40] <agcolom> });
[14:06:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: green on this one, going to merge into master and push
[14:06:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: page.sections isn't bound to "create" like all other widgets
[14:06:30] <agcolom> unless that refers to a different page widget?
[14:06:42] <agcolom> ok
[14:07:12] <uGoMobi> but it is a (sort of) extention of the page widget so I am not sure
[14:07:13] <agcolom> Oh I was looking in the wrong file!
[14:07:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: let's ask _|Nix|_ or arschmitz 
[14:07:48] <arschmitz> Hi
[14:07:52] <uGoMobi> hey :)
[14:08:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you have a look at page.sections?
[14:08:06] <agcolom> hi arschmitz !
[14:08:15] <arschmitz> all widgets have create
[14:08:20] <arschmitz> its part of the widget factory
[14:08:24] <uGoMobi> right
[14:08:40] <uGoMobi> but this is an extension
[14:09:01] <uGoMobi> wasn't sure because there is not _create in the code
[14:09:02] <arschmitz> ok hold on
[14:09:03] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: AFAIK page sections are not widgets (though I was supposed to make them widgets for 1.3) so they have no create.
[14:09:22] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: ok
[14:09:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks

[14:09:47] <uGoMobi> yeah it's a bit a wannabe widget
[14:09:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ is right not a widget no create
[14:09:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: There was a reason though that I didn't turn them into widgets - I can't remember it now ...
[14:09:49] <agcolom> so if they are not widgets, they shouldn't be documented as widgets then?
[14:10:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Glad the sequence tests are of some use.
[14:10:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good question
[14:10:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: You've cleaned them up really nicely.
[14:10:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: they seem to be working pretty smooth now that we sorted out nav a bit
[14:10:35] <johnbender> agreed
[14:10:40] <agcolom> so headers, footers and content are not widgets either
[14:10:53] <arschmitz> agcolom fixed ones are
[14:10:53] <johnbender> lol good things come to those who slave away for a month straight 
[14:10:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It's funny - if it wasn't for popupafteropen/popupafterclose, we could do away with detailedEventCascade and just use pageSequence ...
[14:11:04] <arschmitz> and sections i would not document as a widget right now
[14:11:06] <agcolom> they are part of page.sections which is an extension of the page widget?
[14:11:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we had a helper that let you set the event binding for each callback
[14:11:24] <arschmitz> fixedToolbars is a widget
[14:11:25] <johnbender> the pairs
[14:11:30] <agcolom> (just checking I understand this correctly)

[14:11:39] <arschmitz> header and footer are not
[14:11:49] <agcolom> fixedToolbards, yes, and navbars as well
[14:11:54] <arschmitz> johnbender yes thank you
[14:12:16] <arschmitz> agcolom: page is a widget also just not page sections
[14:12:34] <agcolom> yes, page is a widget.
[14:12:40] <arschmitz> agcolom: its a bit weird
[14:13:05] <arschmitz> because you right header and footer are not but fixedToolbar
[14:13:10] <arschmitz> is
[14:13:23] <agcolom> yes, maybe I should put them in misc for now until we decide what it is? or maybe we could have a category for widget extensions?
[14:13:33] <agcolom> is there something else like that?
[14:13:48] <arschmitz> agcolom: page.sections isnt even actually an extension right now
[14:13:49] <uGoMobi> our toolbars having an identity crisis? ;;)
[14:13:57] <arschmitz> agcolom: or it would have create
[14:14:20] <agcolom> oh, ok. 
[14:14:28] <arschmitz> agcolom: we tend to call them an extension but they are really like a wanna be fake extension lol
[14:14:34] <agcolom> how could we best describe it then??
[14:14:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There's eventCascade, but you can only set one target.
[14:14:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how do I recognize a real extension?
[14:14:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... for all the callbacks - AFAICT.
[14:14:59] <arschmitz> agcolom :listview.filter is not either
[14:15:25] <agcolom> ok, the search filter? 
[14:15:26] <arschmitz> if you look at the file it will have something like $.widget( "mobile.fixedtoolbar", $.mobile.widget, {
[14:15:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz:  ah ok
[14:15:41] <arschmitz> towards the begining
[14:15:43] <johnbender> fixedToolBar*d*s === http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/23963422.jpg
[14:15:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: target is just the element where the binding will wait for the event
[14:16:02] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:16:03] <johnbender> should be fine at the document level eh?
[14:16:07] <johnbender> bubbling and whatnot
[14:16:29] <arschmitz> johnbender: Nice
[14:16:41] <johnbender> arschmitz: my attempt at a joke
[14:16:44] <uGoMobi> I suggest we rename fixedToolbar to fixedToolbars
[14:16:45] * johnbender shrugs
[14:17:09] <arschmitz> johnbender: i got it lol
[14:17:15] <uGoMobi> to solve typos that is
[14:17:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nice
[14:17:29] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:17:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hmmm ... good point ...
[14:17:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have something for the docs i need to work with you on
[14:17:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's not a big win though
[14:17:51] <johnbender> up to you
[14:17:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: FAQ?
[14:18:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes did you catch that from earlier?
[14:18:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: there are other things more worthy of your time
[14:18:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I guess if it ain't broke ...
[14:18:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I catched up
[14:18:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah
[14:18:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool what do you think?
[14:18:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good idea to add a FAQ section
[14:18:51] <arschmitz> it needs to be better looking for sure but i just wanted a starting place to show you and todd
[14:19:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think we really should look into what we want to document where first
[14:19:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: because there is also this new learn site
[14:19:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this wouldnt be something for the learn site i dont think
[14:20:14] <arschmitz> this is suposed to be more of a quick refrence when your having a problem
[14:20:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, what kind of Q? topics you addressed in your talk in Seoul?
[14:20:56] <arschmitz> thats whats there now but it will be for any common mistake we see people making
[14:20:57] <uGoMobi> (sorry, didn't watch the video yet BTW)
[14:21:10] <arschmitz> i just pulled those out as a starting place
[14:21:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[14:21:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what will be content for the learn site?
[14:21:29] <uGoMobi> or agcolom ^^^

[14:22:19] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06slide-panel-refactor 14ae4cff7 15Todd Parker: Panel: flipple overlay shadows, reduced blur and removed from transition
[14:22:27] <agcolom> let me check...
[14:23:32] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz : there is a jQuery FAQ: http://learn.jquery.com/faq/ so we could have one as well if you think that would be good
[14:24:39] <arschmitz> we should check with toddmparker: on this he was pretty enthusastic about this being part of the demo docs this morning
[14:25:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: flipple overlay shadows? I just looked up "flipple" and ended up at sites about breastfeeding techniques 
[14:25:23] <agcolom> arschmitz: sure, we don't have to have an FAQ on the learn site :-)
[14:25:23] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:25:50] <arschmitz> agcolom: either way i think we want one but we should decide where its going to live before diving in to much
[14:26:11] <agcolom> arschmitz: definitely agree. 
[14:26:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, just want to prevent we have to maintain same content at multiple places
[14:27:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for sure the one advantage to the demo docs would be we could work it into a lot of the demos
[14:27:17] <arschmitz> like the answer to many of them might be a demo
[14:27:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: very true
[14:28:12] <arschmitz> and our filtered list view makes it a very easy to use tool as we get to have a very long list
[14:28:25] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz and we can always link from the learn site to the demos
[14:28:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for sure but then its not as smooth an experience jumping between sites 
[14:29:05] <arschmitz> i dont know either way works and they both have their pros and cons
[14:29:25] <agcolom> well we have time to think about it.
[14:30:34] <arschmitz> deffinitly something we want toddmparker in on too
[14:31:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think I'll introduce the .reposition() method. It does the exact same thing as resize (in fact, resize calls reposition), but it doesn't hide/show the popup.
[14:32:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's basically two lines: emit popupbeforeposition, and then call .offset() on the container with the new coordinates.
[14:32:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sounds good, that was the only thing we wanted to get rid off
[14:33:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's actually kind of cool. .reposition() takes the same parameters as open(), but it doesn't care about the transition option, because the popup is already open, after all.
[14:38:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: are you going to add that to popup for 1.3?
[14:38:52] <agcolom> arschmitz: uGoMobi would you say that gridlayout is not a widget, just like page.sections is not a widget?
[14:38:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[14:39:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool!
[14:39:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[14:39:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now, to update all the docs :)
[14:39:36] <arschmitz> agcolom: yes
[14:39:38] <uGoMobi> agcolom: grid is just a function
[14:40:08] <agcolom> ok, so maybe I could document them in the same way...??
[14:40:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: better wait with that
[14:40:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think we are going to move the code to the navbar widget
[14:40:59] <agcolom> ok
[14:41:04] <uGoMobi> agcolom: because that's the only widget that uses that function
[14:41:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats the plan in 1.4 though i think
[14:41:45] <agcolom> because I currently have a misc category for widgets that are not yet widget (and in that I only have gridlayout for now)
[14:41:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah makes sense to do that when we look into the navbar widget for 1.4... some widget stuff missing there
[14:42:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we never documented the grid() function
[14:42:20] <arschmitz> agcolom: i wouldnt document grid
[14:42:28] <agcolom> I just have http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/grid-layout/
[14:43:04] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's going to be removed in 1.3.
[14:43:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: is it 1.3 i thought that was 1.4?
[14:43:31] <uGoMobi> to prevent confusion: grid CSS won't be removed
[14:43:53] <agcolom> but I did that one in October...
[14:43:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes css isnt going anywhere just the function
[14:44:10] <arschmitz> what you posted is the css
[14:44:13] <agcolom> well, it's easy enough to remove stuff :-)
[14:44:37] <arschmitz> agcolom: no i think what you have there is staying they are 2 seperate things essentially
[14:44:48] <agcolom> oh, ok...
[14:45:05] <arschmitz> thats grid-layout css the other is the grid function
[14:45:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: what we are talking about is the grid() funtion that adds those ui-grid and ui-block classes to markup
[14:45:24] <agcolom> ok, right. so I'm good for now then :-)
[14:45:31] <uGoMobi> yes you are :)
[14:45:39] <arschmitz> agcolom: yup :)
[14:45:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I thought were replacing it with demos in 1.3 ...
[14:45:49] <agcolom> perfect :-) that's what I like to hear :-)
[14:45:54] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:45:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we'll do a deprecate cycle in 1.3 ...

[14:46:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure i didnt realize we were depreciating the css
[14:46:27] <arschmitz> i thought just the grid function 
[14:46:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : we will move the grid function to navbar
[14:46:52] <uGoMobi> but I think people will still be able to use it
[14:46:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right sorry thats what i meant by removing
[14:47:05] <uGoMobi> if they found out the function ecists
[14:47:18] <arschmitz> removing from its own and rolling into navbar
[14:47:30] <uGoMobi> exists*
[14:47:37] <uGoMobi> yup
[14:48:00] <uGoMobi> i don't think many people know about it
[14:48:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont either it was never documented
[14:48:15] <uGoMobi> fixed an issue in grid() not long ago
[14:48:28] <arschmitz> we just documented the classes to do it your self
[14:48:31] <uGoMobi> and that issue was a complete blocker
[14:48:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes

[15:11:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: My chrome has never worked.

[15:48:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Lemme guess: You saw my latest commit ... ?
[15:48:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no just responding to your last message
[15:49:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, OK. Yeah. It's all good.
[15:49:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: My latest commit is the start of another story.
[15:49:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We need to figure out how to deal with people redirecting during the second pbc.
[15:49:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: When the page has already been loaded.
[15:50:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: eh
[15:50:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It gets assigned to data.toPage, but people orverwrite it with a string after they examine the page and find that the server has sent them something they don't like.
[15:50:27] <johnbender> why?
[15:50:35] <johnbender> ...
[15:50:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It's a way to deal with redirects.
[15:50:42] <johnbender> ugh
[15:50:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We had a bug about it.
[15:50:52] <johnbender> yah I thought we closed it
[15:51:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we've sort of established that you can't start a new navigation call inside another one
[15:51:27] <johnbender> it fucks everything up
[15:51:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't think we should support that behavior
[15:51:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Naw - it works just fine.
[15:51:51] <johnbender> we'll just be tangling things up more for nearly no value
[15:52:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The only thing is that we don't discard the page, so it stays in the DOM.
[15:53:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We have this whole code path for discarding pages that were AJAXed in. We need to send the redirect-indicator page down that path.
[15:53:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: corner cases
[15:53:34] <johnbender> I can feel them stabbing me in the eyeball as we speak
[15:54:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I seem to be an expert at finding them :) Not sure if I've just dissed myself or not.
[15:54:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: but that's a bunch of complexity
[15:54:28] <johnbender> every time we add ain a corner case
[15:54:33] <johnbender> however small
[15:54:36] <johnbender> the library get's more complex
[15:54:43] <johnbender> it's already at somethin of a critical mass
[15:54:49] <johnbender> ready to implode
[15:54:57] <johnbender> I spent more than a month on this refactor
[15:55:00] <johnbender> because of all the corner cases
[15:55:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm not suggesting we do this now.
[15:55:14] <johnbender> adding more of them is going to make meaningful change impossible
[15:55:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Definitely not.
[15:55:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Absolutely.
[15:55:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Like I said - it's possible even now with some minor issues.
[15:56:13] <johnbender> then I say let the users hack their way through it for now
[15:56:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: For example, after the widget review slated for 1.4, it /should/ be possible to simply call .page( "destroy" ) on a page.
[15:56:26] <johnbender> redirects with ajax are a hack
[15:56:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's exactly what I did. I created a demo showing how it /could/ be done with jQM events.
[15:57:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Don't even necessarily need server-side access.
[15:57:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Just examine the page during pageload and if you find that it's really a redirect, paint it with jqmData() which you then examine during pbc and overwrite toPage to take you wherever you were supposed to go.
[15:58:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... the wrinkle is that toPage will be the page you just loaded - not a string.
[15:58:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But like you said - not important right now.
[15:58:56] <johnbender> yar
[15:59:07] <johnbender> I think we can deal with that in a sane way at some point
[15:59:18] <johnbender> callbacks etc
[15:59:22] <johnbender> event information
[15:59:24] <johnbender> whatever
[15:59:31] <johnbender> the page removal is scary
[15:59:40] <johnbender> when we did the dom caching thing there were soooooo many corner cases
[15:59:47] <johnbender> page sized select menus
[15:59:48] <johnbender> dialogs
[15:59:50] <johnbender> etc etc
[15:59:56] <johnbender> nested lists
[15:59:59] * johnbender stabs himself
[16:00:31] <_|Nix|_> I see ... yeah ... the page life cycle is quite a beast.
[16:01:06] <johnbender> hopefully at some point we can push that management complexity up into a $.mobile.pagecontainer widget
[16:01:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's a good point - especially if we want to support multiple such things.
[16:02:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's gonna be /really/ scary ... unless we do it right.
[16:02:42] <johnbender> I expect it'll be another month or more burried under failing tests :/
[16:03:49] <_|Nix|_> *nod*
[16:03:55] <johnbender> oh well
[16:03:58] <johnbender> now that I've done it
[16:04:02] <johnbender> and I came out the other side
[16:04:06] <johnbender> it doesn't seem so daunting
[16:04:11] <johnbender> it might not be as bad
[16:04:30] <johnbender> since the url management thing is just all the corner cases rolled into one
[16:04:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: YOu know, I was also thinking: If we manage to separate out the nav completely, it'll open the door for people to come up with alternative implementations.
[16:05:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that was the original point
[16:05:14] <johnbender> the refactor is nice for use
[16:05:16] <johnbender> *us
[16:05:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Though I suspect there won't be many candidates vying for the spot :)
[16:05:31] <johnbender> but the idea is to provide these bits to people witout the rest of jqm
[16:05:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no, but I think people would like robust history managment
[16:05:51] <johnbender> there was a post from twitter on how they do it
[16:05:55] <johnbender> they do something similar to what we do
[16:06:01] <johnbender> though it doesn't normalize state
[16:06:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It'll also help us identify the interface between nav and the rest of the library.
[16:06:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah it's clear that the links should call navigate
[16:06:38] <johnbender> and the data object that's passed into the call should be pushed down the navigate event with a type: "new" or some such
[16:06:53] <johnbender> just have to figure out how to do that in a backward compatible way
[16:07:20] <johnbender> I don't think it'll be that hard
[16:07:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: You know, come to think of it, the click handling should also be broken out of nav.
[16:07:45] <johnbender> we talked about that
[16:07:51] <johnbender> it could be
[16:07:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If people choose not to use it, then, although nav is present, the links will still do HTTP.
[16:08:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and it'll be up to them to intercept the clicks or do whatever they want with the nav.
[16:08:16] <johnbender> or they could set something special up to use $.nav in their own click bindings
[16:08:20] <johnbender> but that seems unlikely

[16:09:22] <johnbender> ughhh!
[16:09:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, at the very least we could separate out the class juggling code.
[16:09:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: vclick and form submit do nothing but juggle classes on buttons.
[16:09:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's not really nav.
[16:10:53] <johnbender> great
[16:10:59] <johnbender> uglify is vomiting in a non obvious way
[16:12:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Actually, NM. It's only vclick that could be yanked, but both it and the submit handler call a common function (to determine whether the submit button will result in an AJAX call).
[16:14:22] <_|Nix|_> I think I'm gonna hit the hay ...
