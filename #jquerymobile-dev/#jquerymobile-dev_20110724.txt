[00:13:38] <shesek> Is the call to $.mobile.initializePage wrapped in another $() by purpose at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.init.js#L127 ?
[00:14:21] <shesek> It causing the initializePage to get called after the functions I'm binding to the document ready event, while I was expecting them to run after jqm finishes its initialization. Is that intentional ?
[00:16:16] <shesek> Oops, I guess I should've asked that at #jquerymobile, not here, right? sorry :O
