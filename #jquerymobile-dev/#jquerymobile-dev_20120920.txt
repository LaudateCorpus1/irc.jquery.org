[04:27:29] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: thanks, i can cut those down
[04:27:47] <toddmparker_> i was rushing last night to update logos and bit off more than i could chew
[04:35:11] <toddmparker_> cracks me up i broke something then reported the issue right after
[06:12:41] <toddmparker_> New blocker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5040
[06:46:29] <toddmparker_> Popups on Opera Mini are a no go - think this is hashchange related
[06:46:45] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: you here
[06:50:37] <toddmparker_> another regression I found after upgrading to iOS6 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5041
[06:54:58] <toddmparker_> so we have two blockers to patch up before RC2
[07:00:42] <toddmparker_> found a cool example of a range slider (dual handle) based on jQM
[07:00:44] <toddmparker_> http://m.travelrepublic.co.uk/
[07:01:06] <toddmparker_> get to results, hit "filter" on top, then open "Price per person"
[07:01:27] <toddmparker_> @wilto is looking at this for a client project but we can try and roll it back in
[07:04:16] <toddmparker_> they have a spinner too - http://m.travelrepublic.co.uk/hotels/search-hotels.aspx#select-occupancy
[07:32:48] <toddmparker_> ugomobi - you here?
[07:33:49] <toddmparker_> thinking about the question of the demos by robschmuecker...I'm thinking that adding these now would be fine. Seems like the new new direction is to pull out the API style stuff from the current docs and have them be more about real-world demos and such
[07:34:04] <toddmparker_> so i think he could add those now
[07:53:27] <robschmuecker> I'll add them shortly and then which branch do I send a PR to?
[07:54:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I am here now
[07:54:52] <uGoMobi> only to catch up though, will be back for meeting
[07:55:02] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: branch master is fine
[07:55:14] <robschmuecker> ok thanks
[07:55:27] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: do you think your example requires  new page?
[07:55:46] <uGoMobi> like we did for some popup examples
[07:56:49] <robschmuecker> yes I saw those but at the moment it's only one example so think it would be a bit of overkill for it's own page for now - however I could perhaps make a couple of differing examples which would "qualify" better for their own page?
[07:57:12] <uGoMobi> that would be cool
[07:57:39] <robschmuecker> ok - I'll have a little hack around and see if I can come up with a few differing examples.
[07:58:12] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: ok great, thanks
[08:36:57] <toddmparker_> I created an agenda here for today's meeting - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1yY54F02Khk6DIfmD4GUC_EcdE1GEuVTxwFhtIG-38/edit#
[08:37:11] <toddmparker_> please fill it out in the next two hours
[08:37:50] <toddmparker_> robschmuecker: you're welcome to join today in #jquery-meeting
[08:38:52] <toddmparker_> wilto is looking at the select issue in iOS6
[08:39:07] <toddmparker_> we need to look at popups in Opera Mini - _|Nix|_ ?
[08:47:18] <johnbender> is _|Nix|_ around?
[09:22:27] <Wilto> Maaan.
[09:22:40] <Wilto> Okay, so, I got a fix for the iOS6 zoom issue, but it ain’t pretty.
[09:23:37] <Wilto> Looks like there’s an event timing difference. `vmousedown`, zoom is disabled, `mouseup`, zoom is enabled, *then* the zoom happens.
[09:24:38] <Wilto> Speaking of this fix: I’m thinking about getting “setTi” and “meout” knuckle tattoos, with a big ol’ zero on one palm.
[09:24:57] <kinblas> Wilto: heh
[09:25:23] <Wilto> So. Yeah. It works, but I wouldn’t mind more eyes on it.
[09:25:45] <Wilto> I tried switching it back from v-thing events in hopes that the inherent iOS delay would do something; no dice.
[09:25:56] <kinblas> Wilto: what's the issue #?
[09:26:51] <Wilto> touchstart and touchend skew the timing too much; they’re all over the place.
[09:27:01] <Wilto> One sec. Also, hey kin!

[09:55:29] <johnbender> Wilto: ^ that one looks legit
[09:55:37] <Wilto> ?mum
[09:55:37] <bot-t> much unlike myself
[09:55:41] <Wilto> Wait, yeah?
[09:56:01] <Wilto> Oh, hm. Yeah, that makes sense.
[09:56:09] <johnbender> the name of the test is "preventFocusZoom option is working as expected"
[09:56:15] <Wilto> what could it mean
[09:56:34] <johnbender> Wilto: well you just pushed a change to the zoom handling right?
[09:56:44] <Wilto> Hah, yeah, just screwing around. I’m on it.
[09:56:52] <johnbender> Wilto: nice
[10:14:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Ping!
[10:15:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Whoops ... I never submitted that reply to your comment :)
[10:17:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/6ef910d929edaa4c479eef61a814beb82b685c0f#commitcomment-1883135

[10:38:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Kludgey fix in the test now matches the kludgey fix in the code. - Mat Marquis
[10:46:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: fair enough
[10:46:41] <johnbender> It certainly feels like nav is becoming a tower of dogshit at this poin
[10:46:45] <johnbender> *point
[10:47:08] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[10:48:18] <johnbender> Wilto: will you add a comment there and where you added the setTimeout so that we know why that was don
[10:48:26] <johnbender> Wilto: you could reference the issue too if you want
[10:48:28] <Wilto> Sir, yes sir.
[10:48:48] <johnbender> Wilto: thanks, there are a lot of hacks in the codebase without comments which are hard to understand when you come back to it later
[10:49:18] <Wilto> what hacks in jqm surely that cannot be
[10:49:23] <Wilto> DAMMIT SCOTT
[10:56:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It may be dogshit, but we'll have to at least equal it with any replacement we might concoct :)
[10:58:57] <_|Nix|_> Do we have an agenda?
[11:00:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1yY54F02Khk6DIfmD4GUC_EcdE1GEuVTxwFhtIG-38/edit#heading=h.crg760xoxv4
[11:00:47] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: hey! did you have a chance to look at that popup issue on opera mini?
[11:00:50] <toddmparker_> meeting time!
[11:01:37] <robschmuecker> Ok - I'm present and will just lurk around!
[11:04:49] <maxlynch> Hey toddmparker_ I'm here just FYI
[11:09:01] <Wilto> kinblas: Did you want to have a look at that iOS6 fix?
[11:10:39] <toddmparker_> robschmuecker: ok
[11:20:48] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: you are right, the popup examples at the bottom don't open on opera mini
[11:21:01] <toddmparker_> boo
[11:36:04] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: we should look at those enhancements after the checkin
[11:48:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I installed Opera mini onto Android 2.3.5 and all popups open, albeit at the top of the window.
[11:49:40] <toddmparker_> hmm
[11:49:52] <toddmparker_> let me make sure i'm running the latest mini on iOS
[11:50:09] <toddmparker_> I'm on 7.0.2
[11:50:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I've got 7.5.31657
[11:51:15] <toddmparker_> 7.0.3 is latest...upgrading
[11:51:31] <toddmparker_> is the photo popup working?
[11:51:39] <toddmparker_> that was a no go
[11:52:01] <_|Nix|_> That one doesn't work.
[11:52:22] <toddmparker_> curious if the photo hasn't loaded so it doesn't show up?
[11:52:25] <toddmparker_> timing issue
[11:52:35] <_|Nix|_> Finally found the picture: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Flammarion.jpg ... that's what navigation does when you open a popup, refresh, open a popup, close a popup.
[11:53:15] <toddmparker_> woah
[11:53:49] <toddmparker_> let's just say opera mini is crap for anything interactive. fast for reading a static web page, but this is not it's strong point
[11:53:59] <_|Nix|_> The difference is you don't notice it, because it seems to behave correctly, in that you find yourself on the page from which you opened the popup.
[11:55:08] <toddmparker_> broken image in my jsbin
[11:55:52] <robschmuecker> Hi @_Nix_ & @toddmparker
[11:55:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK, so, what's the conclusion wrt. opera mini?
[11:56:02] <_|Nix|_> robschmuecker: Hi!
[11:56:08] <toddmparker_> try: http://jsbin.com/evodet/4/
[11:56:30] <toddmparker_> fixed the image path, added some text in the photo popup for good measure
[11:56:37] <robschmuecker> I like you analogy of the voodoo that is happening regarding nav/popups!
[11:57:01] <toddmparker_> yeah :)
[11:57:13] <robschmuecker> I've got opera mini 7.5 on android 2.3.7 and it's not even hnouring rounded corners?
[11:57:22] <toddmparker_> so even with those fixes, the popup just scrolls
[11:57:24] <robschmuecker> I've got opera mini 7.5 on android 2.3.7 and it's not even honouring rounded corners?
[11:57:30] <toddmparker_> nope. limited css
[11:57:35] <toddmparker_> or gradients
[11:57:38] <toddmparker_> or shadows
[11:57:54] <toddmparker_> or proper monospace fonts
[11:58:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: No joy.
[11:58:55] <toddmparker_> so i dunno, maybe there is something about thephoto popup it doesn't like?
[11:59:00] <robschmuecker> I hadn't ever tried it until I saw your issue and whilst it's fast and clean it's behaving quite quite strange!
[11:59:10] <robschmuecker> yes the photo just scrolls up on mine too.
[11:59:12] <toddmparker_> that's mini
[11:59:24] <toddmparker_> it's a proxy browser so the server sends back a compressed image of the page
[11:59:36] <toddmparker_> each interaction requires a round trip
[11:59:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: sysadmins' favourite, no doubt :)
[12:00:01] <robschmuecker> yes I see that as it's always putting in request for the interaction . .
[12:00:06] <robschmuecker> :)
[12:00:30] <toddmparker_> so these photo examples also do not work
[12:00:31] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/popup-images.html
[12:00:33] <robschmuecker> where and why does it proxy through?
[12:00:47] <toddmparker_> i really think this might be an odd timing thing with their renderer
[12:00:56] <toddmparker_> thru opera's servers
[12:00:57] <_|Nix|_> robschmuecker: Somewhere in .no, presumably?
[12:01:04] <toddmparker_> mini isn't a real browser = no rendering engine
[12:01:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I guess things that are not visible are not even fetched.
[12:01:47] <toddmparker_> my theory too
[12:01:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: So, when you make the image visible, it needs to be fetched ...
[12:01:58] <toddmparker_> if they aren't there fast enough..poof
[12:02:05] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[12:02:05] <toddmparker_> yep
[12:02:23] <_|Nix|_> I dunno ... I'm tempted not to worry too much about this issue ...
[12:02:33] <robschmuecker> yes they don't work either and don;t even seem to send a request for antyhing?  At least it isn't showing the loading bar as it does for the "form" and dialog.
[12:02:47] <_|Nix|_> It's not like we're missing out on a huge market segment because of this issue.
[12:03:09] <toddmparker_> try this: http://jsbin.com/evodet/5/
[12:03:28] <toddmparker_> same photo popup, but i replaced the image with a paragraph and text
[12:03:47] <_|Nix|_> Works.
[12:03:53] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[12:03:57] <robschmuecker> yes i just get "some text" but overay works
[12:04:05] <robschmuecker> overlay rather!
[12:04:25] <toddmparker_> yep, for me too
[12:04:29] <toddmparker_> just narrowing this down
[12:04:37] <toddmparker_> that's what I added
[12:04:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I do believe, however, that, after attempting to open the photo, the other popups are broken.
[12:04:48] <toddmparker_> so this is displayed right then
[12:04:50] * _|Nix|_ go test that now
[12:04:54] <toddmparker_> ok
[12:06:00] <robschmuecker> @ _Nix_ hmmm quite, perhaps it could be a small enough fix and worth trying to keep them onboard . . .  although I get the impression if people are "knowledgeable" enough to download opera instead of default browsers they ought to appreciate that they might be foregoing functionality.  Do any phones ship with Opera pre-installed?
[12:07:29] <toddmparker_> yep, a lot of featurephones do
[12:07:50] <toddmparker_> opera mini and mobile are hugely popular and many times they are pre-installed
[12:08:07] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... I guess it might be worth looking at then ...
[12:08:12] <toddmparker_> yep
[12:08:29] <robschmuecker> oh right - wasn't aware.  yes I see by the play store the downloads are impressive . . so yes as you say _Nix_ this isn't something we can easily just push aside.
[12:08:38] <toddmparker_> get this: that popup works ok with a broken image in there
[12:08:38] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/evodet/7/
[12:08:41] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, weird ... clicking on "photo" does not generate a request ...
[12:08:46] <toddmparker_> wonder if it's a style thing?
[12:09:22] <Wilto> Did someone call for “style?” Because HERE I AM.
[12:09:30] <Wilto> Can I help with the Opera issue?
[12:09:47] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Opera Mini. Major diff.
[12:10:10] <toddmparker_> so this popup has an image and it's ok
[12:10:11] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/evodet/8/
[12:10:17] <Wilto> Can I help with the Wee Tiny Widdle Opera issue?
[12:10:20] <robschmuecker> on the last iteration #7 I don't get anything on android 2.3.7
[12:10:28] <robschmuecker> when clicking photo that is.
[12:10:40] <robschmuecker> Hi Wilto, I'm Rob !
[12:11:07] <Wilto> Whatup.
[12:11:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: /8/ works for me.
[12:11:22] <toddmparker_> this one has only and image so it's identical to the original except for the image tag contents and it works!
[12:11:23] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/evodet/9/
[12:11:24] <robschmuecker> success - I now get image and overlay working still on #7
[12:11:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I see the Google logo
[12:11:41] <robschmuecker> I get text and google logo on #7
[12:11:46] <toddmparker_> so what's the difference between the google logo and that photo?
[12:12:36] <Wilto> a couple kilobytes yuk yuk yuk
[12:12:50] <robschmuecker> ?! No idea?  perhaps they serve that as an inline base-64 image as it's being cached by their proxies so often?
[12:13:17] <robschmuecker> on #9 I only see the google logo with overlay at top of page but without text?
[12:13:18] <_|Nix|_> Try the above image
[12:14:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Flammarion.jpg
[12:14:19] <robschmuecker> :)
[12:14:20] <_|Nix|_> I'm certain they don't see that image often ...
[12:15:08] <Wilto> This is a weird one.
[12:15:42] <toddmparker_> ok, so i started back at the docs example and pulled off the class on the image, think that might do it
[12:15:44] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/evodet/11/
[12:15:48] <toddmparker_> no dice
[12:16:52] <robschmuecker> nope #11 isn't doing anything apart from scrolling to the top
[12:17:13] <_|Nix|_> Same here.
[12:18:40] <toddmparker_> gah
[12:19:02] <toddmparker_> stripped down example with just the image tag: http://jsbin.com/evodet/15/
[12:19:17] <toddmparker_> same with just the src swapped to the google logo: http://jsbin.com/evodet/17/
[12:19:24] <toddmparker_> now neither work
[12:20:05] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... beats me ...
[12:20:39] <Wilto> —wait.
[12:20:43] <Wilto> Broken image link on Chrome.
[12:20:48] <Wilto> Using the non-Google logo.
[12:20:58] <toddmparker_> base tag problem?
[12:21:02] <Wilto> And a “communication with the server” error in Opera WeeTiny if you wait a few minutes.
[12:21:05] <robschmuecker> http://jsbin.com/evodet/23/edit
[12:21:06] <Wilto> Could that be choking the popup?
[12:21:11] <robschmuecker> seems to work for me . . .
[12:21:19] <Wilto> Swapping it for a working Google logo fixes it.
[12:21:23] <robschmuecker> i stripped out the "<a href= .... "
[12:21:41] <Wilto> Valid photo there.
[12:22:09] <robschmuecker> the close button markup is gone but I don't remember seeing that on the other image of google's either
[12:22:17] <Wilto> 3MB photo could be choking the browser as well.
[12:22:24] <toddmparker_> 23 works for me
[12:22:44] <toddmparker_> so what's the difference here
[12:22:52] <robschmuecker> yes true, but I think as the gents mentioned, opera proxies the stuff and perhaps sends a minifed/smaller version
[12:23:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Not only does it work, but it scales the picture to fit!
[12:23:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ... or did you shrink the pic yourself.
[12:23:34] <_|Nix|_> ?
[12:23:47] <robschmuecker> @_Nix_ it's that pagan voodoo you've been going on about ! :)
[12:23:52] <toddmparker_> take 25, remove that paragraph inside = broken
[12:23:52] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/evodet/25/
[12:23:54] <Wilto> Voodoo is my thing.
[12:23:56] <toddmparker_> sorry, 23
[12:24:03] <robschmuecker> No I did #23 straight with you link from wikimedia
[12:24:03] <Wilto> I got the chicken skulls on my desk to prove it; ask Todd.
[12:24:13] <Wilto> I bet it’s the broken image.
[12:24:27] <robschmuecker> I added back the link and it doesn't work now :(
[12:24:28] <toddmparker_> right, but my theory is that without some other bit of content, the popup dies
[12:24:34] <toddmparker_> image only = busted
[12:24:36] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: It breaks even with a working image.
[12:24:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Clunk ... that's my jaw hitting the floor ...
[12:25:06] <toddmparker_> if you take 23 which we all know works and nix the <p>, broken
[12:25:07] <robschmuecker> Mine works with image and text just not with the Close link?
[12:25:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: We could tell people to add an &nbsp; for image-only?
[12:25:14] <toddmparker_> ha
[12:25:17] <Wilto> websites are stupid
[12:25:24] <toddmparker_> try it
[12:25:29] <Wilto> Wait. Wait wait wait.
[12:26:37] <Wilto> Because it’s fetching or not fetching the image at the time the popup is invoked the delay is kicking in and preventing the popup—which has no viable content at the time of invocation—from kicking in.
[12:26:48] <Wilto> With text in place, there’s a popup to speak of, and the image loads after the fact.
[12:26:53] <Wilto> Even an nbsp.
[12:27:12] <Wilto> I wonder if we could force it to recognize an unloaded image by assigning it a min-height/width.
[12:27:21] <Wilto> Aside: this is so Android-y.
[12:28:04] <toddmparker_> my theory: before the image loads, mini says "hey that's empty" and does  a no op
[12:28:09] <toddmparker_> added  style="min-width:1px; min-height:1px;"
[12:28:11] <Wilto> TOO LATE TODD
[12:28:16] <Wilto> BEAT YOU THERE
[12:28:17] <Wilto> BOOYAH
[12:28:23] <toddmparker_> to the image and it kinda works
[12:28:29] <robschmuecker> makes sense, but why are Opera the boss of our "empty divs" ?!
[12:28:30] <_|Nix|_> Kinda?
[12:28:33] <toddmparker_> no nbsp!!
[12:28:36] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/bird-party.gif
[12:28:39] <toddmparker_> rather do an image thing
[12:28:48] <Wilto> …I have a plan.
[12:28:59] <Wilto> ( http://wil.to/_/plan.gif )
[12:29:25] <toddmparker_> FIXED
[12:29:26] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/evodet/29/edit
[12:29:29] <robschmuecker> @Wilto haha !
[12:29:42] <toddmparker_> style="min-width:10px; min-height:10px;"
[12:29:51] <toddmparker_> 1px was too small apparently
[12:29:54] <Wilto> toddmparker_: http://wil.to/_/brofist.gif
[12:30:03] <toddmparker_> BOOM
[12:30:12] <Wilto> FILAMENT GROUP. WHAT.
[12:30:15] <Wilto> —ahem…
[12:30:22] <_|Nix|_> Man ... that's so arbitrary ...
[12:31:03] <_|Nix|_> So, like put that in the _assets CSS and document? Eeeeeew!
[12:31:37] <toddmparker_> this is all we need
[12:31:38] <toddmparker_>  style="min-width:2px;"
[12:31:51] <robschmuecker> in the accent of Borat - "Great Success"
[12:31:58] <toddmparker_> well, we can add that to the widget css with a comment that opera mini is a dummy
[12:32:26] <robschmuecker> yes - what about min-width:1px?
[12:32:47] <toddmparker_> .ui-popup img { style="min-width:2px;"  }
[12:32:54] <toddmparker_> didn't seem to work robschmuecker
[12:33:00] <toddmparker_> lemme re-try
[12:33:03] <Wilto> TWO pixels. Now you’re drunk with voodoo power, Todd.
[12:33:11] <robschmuecker> oh sorry just saw that - how odd!
[12:33:33] <toddmparker_> 1px - try it
[12:33:33] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/evodet/31/
[12:33:58] <Wilto> …Hm.
[12:34:19] <robschmuecker> #31 works for me
[12:34:41] <Wilto> Thing is, say the user has an empty div in there.
[12:34:48] <Wilto> And plans to populate it after the popup opens.
[12:34:50] <Wilto> Same issue.
[12:35:24] <robschmuecker> yes :( but . . .  we could perhaps
[12:35:25] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Such a user is a js programmer. Their problem.
[12:35:40] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: We could hint at such issues in the docs.
[12:35:40] <Wilto> Hooowever…
[12:35:41] <robschmuecker> play with min-height of the div and it might have same effect?
[12:35:50] <Wilto> :after, bros. :after.
[12:36:03] <robschmuecker> also we haven't got it working with the link yet have we?
[12:36:07] <Wilto> I wonder if we injected an element via CSS and set a height and width on it…
[12:36:21] <toddmparker_> seems to work
[12:36:27] <Wilto> That would serve as the shim regardless of what users dropped in there, yeah?
[12:38:22] <robschmuecker> http://jsbin.com/uxipum/1/edit is working with image and a very unsightly link!
[12:46:58] <_|Nix|_> OK, so I have since figured out how to load pages from a local server into Opera mini. If I comment out the close button link, the photo popup works.
[12:47:59] <robschmuecker> I wonder if by some freak the button is actually getting triggered and hence the pop-up close before it's even opened?
[12:48:24] <_|Nix|_> Maybe ...
[12:49:03] <_|Nix|_> Well, I set the link target to http://slashdot.org/ and it didn't send me to /.
[12:49:24] <_|Nix|_> So, I don't think it's getting triggered.
[12:49:42] <_|Nix|_> Its presence is, however, causing distress.
[12:50:26] <_|Nix|_> It's the link that breaks things.
[12:50:27] <robschmuecker> distress - great use of that word!
[12:50:46] <_|Nix|_> Popup with close button left/right is also broken.
[12:51:48] <_|Nix|_> So, maybe its the styling of the close button that breaks things, because other popups containing links (such as the nested menu) work.
[12:52:32] <robschmuecker> Just for reference, I am able to make an empty pop-up with min-height;1px; min-width:1px; and inject markup at a later stage.
[12:53:02] <robschmuecker> I wonder if it's background image position or positioning perhaps?
[12:53:28] <_|Nix|_> Well, lemme try toning down the close button style.
[12:54:16] <robschmuecker> sorry scrap that thought I wasn't sure whether it was marking up the arrows in the menus but it does seem to be.
[12:55:00] <robschmuecker> wouldn't it be grand if you could just do something like style="none;" !
[12:55:32] <robschmuecker> Do you guys ever work with weinre?
[12:57:31] <_|Nix|_> Photo works just fine if I comment out the .ui-popup > .ui-btn-left and .ui-popup > .ui-btn-right portions of css/structure/jquery.mobile.popup.css ...
[12:57:50] <robschmuecker> http://jsbin.com/oqodoc/1/
[12:58:03] <robschmuecker> works without a photo but with the close button . . .
[12:59:04] <_|Nix|_> Wow!
[12:59:25] <robschmuecker> Aside: it seems that JasonDScott is a popular name amongst JQM Devs ! :)
[12:59:35] <robschmuecker> there's 2 of them in the chat !
[13:00:22] <_|Nix|_> So, ... hmmm ... weird ... but it's definitely maybe the close button.
[13:00:36] <robschmuecker> yes . . .  definately maybe !
[13:01:24] <JasonDScott> robschmuecker: Its just my clone :P
[13:01:35] <robschmuecker> :) sorry to wake you !
[13:01:46] <robschmuecker> you both !
[13:03:14] <robschmuecker> http://jsbin.com/unosow/2/ works with post injecting an image at least.
[13:05:44] <robschmuecker> OK for an odd reason, http://jsbin.com/akumex/1/ now works without any voodoo as it should?
[13:08:37] <robschmuecker> Yep, no added styling, no post-injection, nada . . . but when I say "as it should" that is whilst conveniently forgetting that one must still scroll to the top of the page to see it?
[13:10:54] <robschmuecker> I've worked out that by just having an empty "onclick" handler it works fine but the moment you remove that everything goes to the dogs.
[13:11:43] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: If I comment out this line (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.popup.css#L122), the close-button-endowed popups in the docs work fine.
[13:12:58] <_|Nix|_> Well, for small values of fine, seeing as how they show up at the top 'n all, but at least they work.
[13:14:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/lM8zdQ
[13:14:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup] Add hashListeningEnabled to the intersection that establishes whether we will use history or not - Gabriel Schulhof
[13:15:43] <robschmuecker> It's definately affected by the presence of an empty onclick handler . how odd...
[13:17:19] <robschmuecker> without it the example doesnt want to work in a vanilla fashion but adding 'onclick="function(){}" ' and it shows all content with close button etc.
[13:17:41] <robschmuecker> the onclick going onto the button that calls the popUp that is.
[13:18:34] <_|Nix|_> Wow! Well, it seems the presence of a top or bottom property in the CSS also breaks it.
[13:19:19] <_|Nix|_> Not too sure what to do anymore ... it's not like CSS can be made conditional ...
[13:19:25] <_|Nix|_> AFAIK ...
[13:19:39] <robschmuecker> That is might strange - obviously there's some funky stuff going on regaridn the positioning.
[13:20:50] <robschmuecker> With previous experience with ExtJS what they do in the initial bootstrapping they check which browser is running and i think they do add/amend certain css rules to make it as x-browser compatible as they can.
[13:21:35] <_|Nix|_> Eeeeew!
[13:21:46] <robschmuecker> That's really not a trainsmash if your CSS changes can fix this issue we can add an identification of Opera and amend the CSS values . . .
[13:22:14] <robschmuecker> I know it's far from ideal but x-browser compatibility is such a minefield time and time again !
[13:23:36] <robschmuecker> the identification of opera would be 1 line and then the CSS change maybe a couple more but it's not going to make any noticeable difference on its own to code size or download times.
[13:37:13] <toddmparker_> back from my call
[13:37:16] <toddmparker_> where we at?
[13:37:54] <robschmuecker> ok - @_Nix_ has been experimenting with CSS and has found out some interesting discrepancies which seem to break functionality
[13:38:46] <robschmuecker> We've alse found that everything works as it should apart from pop-up still being positioned at top of page if you add an empty onclick handler onto the calling button/link
[13:39:51] <toddmparker_> fun
[13:40:10] <toddmparker_> so it looks like the -top position is causing issues too?
[13:40:17] <robschmuecker> Like here http://jsbin.com/ubepus/1/  . . . . yes far from ideal...
[13:41:12] <toddmparker_> have you tried a negative top margin instead of top: -9px
[13:41:27] <robschmuecker> I did perhaps suggest to _Nix_ that if he can get it sorted purely by a CSS change we could do a one-line regExp for "Opera Mobi" on the UA string and then override offending CSS properties.
[13:41:53] <toddmparker_> i think we already have a support test because we need to kick them out of ajax nav
[13:42:08] <toddmparker_> but if we can use negative margin
[13:42:09] <robschmuecker> Even better in that case
[13:43:17] <robschmuecker> That way there would be no opera-specific quirks for the average developer.
[13:43:31] <toddmparker_> where is a bin that is as vanillas possible, but broken?
[13:43:40] <toddmparker_>   <style type="text/css">
[13:43:40] <toddmparker_>     .ui-popup > .ui-btn-right {
[13:43:40] <toddmparker_>       top:0;
[13:43:40] <toddmparker_>       margin-top:-9px;
[13:43:40] <toddmparker_>     }
[13:43:41] <toddmparker_>   </style>
[13:44:09] <toddmparker_> robschmuecker: that is what we aim to do, find a happy medium with the least amount of UA madness
[13:44:58] <robschmuecker> http://jsbin.com/ubepus/1 is the one working with the onclick handler and http://jsbin.com/ubepus/1/edit is without and doesn't work . . .
[13:45:21] <robschmuecker> I think it is pretty vanilla that last link.
[13:46:34] <robschmuecker> I'll be interested to see if that positioning can do the trick and not agitate other browsers (sigh)
[13:52:00] <toddmparker_> i'm having no luck
[13:52:34] <robschmuecker> Still busy fiddling . . .
[13:54:42] <toddmparker_> me too
[13:54:54] <toddmparker_> you're right - it does seem to be the close link
[13:55:55] <robschmuecker> we thought it might be getting triggered and hence the pop-up was getting close before it even opened but _Nix_ tested that with an external URL and it didn't take him to that one.
[13:57:03] <toddmparker_> hrm
[13:57:07] <robschmuecker> the strange thing is that literally all CSS issues and non-appearance of the pop-up go away when there's an empty function in onclick ?  Perhaps opera thinks there's manipulation to come and leaves it be.
[13:57:25] <Wilto> Guys. No fair working on voodoo fixes without me.
[13:57:33] <Wilto> This is like *all I can do* on this gig.
[13:58:00] <robschmuecker> :-) maybe we can give a shout to the opera devs and get some feedback from them?
[13:58:34] <robschmuecker> just don't let them read our previous mutterings !
[13:59:00] <Wilto> “Love and war.”
[13:59:11] <Wilto> But yeah, we got this.
[13:59:15] <Wilto> Lemme try some stuff; hang on.
[14:04:56] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/evodet/41/edit
[14:05:10] <toddmparker_> switching from position: absolute to relative fixes it
[14:05:52] <toddmparker_>   <style type="text/css">
[14:05:52] <toddmparker_>     .ui-popup > .ui-btn-left,
[14:05:52] <toddmparker_>     .ui-popup > .ui-btn-right { top:0; position: relative; }
[14:05:52] <toddmparker_>   </style>
[14:07:01] <robschmuecker> Good news
[14:09:34] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[14:10:20] <robschmuecker> yes it works vanilla that way :) now to see what if any other browsers it upsets?
[14:11:00] <robschmuecker> then we can just make it conditional tied in with the Ajax nav
[14:11:24] <toddmparker_> well, relative looks broken
[14:11:41] <toddmparker_> was just confirming what css property was causing havoc
[14:11:53] <robschmuecker> however compared to the empty onclick handler whilst it renders at least the button doesn't float over the top of the image like it should. . . .
[14:12:27] <robschmuecker> yes quite - it looks broken but then again most of the UI looks quite different in Opera.
[14:14:57] <robschmuecker> it also seems to be the issue that once a popup has been opened it doesn't open again with the "relative" fix.
[14:15:24] <robschmuecker> or maybe your still playing with the bin
[14:17:45] <toddmparker_> it's a blanket rule so opera mini is just losing it's mind
[14:20:50] <Wilto> Something I have done has fixed it.
[14:20:54] <Wilto> Now I have to find that thing.
[14:20:55] <Wilto> Thumbsup.
[14:21:47] <robschmuecker> fingers x'd
[14:24:45] <toddmparker_> nope
[14:24:55] <toddmparker_> he tacke don position: relative
[14:26:17] <Wilto> i will see this bug fixed you mark my words jqmobros
[14:27:07] <robschmuecker> :)
[14:27:38] <toddmparker_> miketaylr - your browser is broken
[14:27:52] <Wilto> DAMMIT, MIKE
[14:28:06] <Wilto> jQuery Moroboros.
[14:28:20] <robschmuecker> These are 2 screenshots of what I see with the relative fix and the onclick fix.
[14:28:22] <robschmuecker> http://imagebin.org/229180
[14:28:54] <robschmuecker> @toddmparker - what were the side-effects of the css fix that you noticed apart from what's in the image?
[14:28:58] <uGoMobi> on this on I can open all popups, including the ones with close btn... the position is still way off though
[14:29:04] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/ubepus/3
[14:29:25] <uGoMobi> I set z-index for ui-popup and close btn
[14:32:16] <uGoMobi> did I already say that it only works the first time you open the popup? :(
[14:32:26] <robschmuecker> @uGoMobi That's still got an empty onclick handler on the popupPhoto button in the example - I wonder if taking that out makes any difference
[14:32:36] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: /3/ works for you?
[14:32:48] <uGoMobi> 1st time i opened them
[14:32:57] <toddmparker_> ah, that has  onclick="function(){}"
[14:33:02] <toddmparker_> on the photo popup
[14:33:08] <toddmparker_> trying to find a non-JS hack
[14:33:47] <uGoMobi> what is the JSBin without that?
[14:34:41] <uGoMobi> just want to try some CSS
[14:35:06] <robschmuecker> Here's one without JS and your previous CSS changes http://jsbin.com/owesaj/1/
[14:35:15] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[14:35:17] <robschmuecker> yes thats a given - JS hack is far from ideal.  However I wonder if it can give us any clues as to why it's behaving the way it is.
[14:35:47] <robschmuecker> @uGoMobi sorry make that http://jsbin.com/owesaj/2
[14:35:55] <uGoMobi> sure np
[14:36:07] <Wilto> http://jsbin.com/akeyaf/70/edit
[14:36:10] <Wilto> Clone that sucker.
[14:37:16] <robschmuecker> @uGoMobi it's looking as decent without the JS as with on your CSS work. . .
[14:37:50] <Wilto> fdjskafndkjs
[14:38:22] <toddmparker_> so we have plan B - we can always use the opera mini detection from support to add this empty handler. but that's gross
[14:39:26] <robschmuecker> yes that's not really feasible - if we can get CSS tricks which may be Opera specific and inject those on Opera detection that would be quite acceptable IMO
[14:39:54] <robschmuecker> @Wilto that #70 isn't doing it on my Opera unfortunately?  Was that what your keysplurge was referring to?!
[14:40:06] <Wilto> Oh, no. Just saying, smaller test case.
[14:40:16] <Wilto> I ain’t figured it out yet either.
[14:40:24] <toddmparker_> throwing  a ton of css at it
[14:40:30] <robschmuecker> @uGoMobi's http://jsbin.com/owesaj/2 is pretty close I think.
[14:40:32] <Wilto> How I roll.
[14:40:36] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi just nuke those overrides @ top
[14:40:47] <Wilto> There’s always some stupid CSS _something_ that fixes these things.
[14:41:06] <robschmuecker> yes - like a clear:both !?
[14:41:22] <uGoMobi> zoom: 1 :D
[14:41:23] <Wilto> Yep. Remember IE?
[14:41:33] <Wilto> position: absolute; could sometimes be tamed with clear: both;
[14:41:38] <robschmuecker> the old clearfix circus :)
[14:41:43] <Wilto> You should see some of the stuff we’ve done for Android.
[14:42:10] <uGoMobi> ok, so the z-index seems to make sure they open
[14:42:27] <uGoMobi> but don't ask where they open :)
[14:42:31] <robschmuecker> it CANNOT be as bad as IE though I'm hoping ? :-|
[14:42:32] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: that bin looks good...how are you positioning those buttons so they look good with :relative?
[14:42:59] <toddmparker_> works in my mini
[14:43:12] <uGoMobi>   <style type="text/css">
[14:43:12] <uGoMobi>     .ui-popup {
[14:43:12] <uGoMobi>       z-index: 1101;
[14:43:12] <uGoMobi>       position: relative;
[14:43:12] <uGoMobi>     }
[14:43:13] <uGoMobi>     .ui-popup > .ui-btn-left {
[14:43:13] <uGoMobi>       z-index: 1102;
[14:43:14] <uGoMobi>     }
[14:43:14] <uGoMobi>   </style>
[14:43:20] <uGoMobi> that's all
[14:43:43] <toddmparker_> yeah but...huh
[14:43:54] <Wilto> —wait.
[14:44:04] <robschmuecker> I think the position is totally different angle of ahhack
[14:44:06] <toddmparker_> is there a popup wrapper that is abs pos?
[14:44:17] <Wilto> It’s positioning context.
[14:44:20] <Wilto> absolute within absolute.
[14:44:29] <Wilto> If there’s a relative element inbetween, I bet we’re good.
[14:44:41] <uGoMobi> the container is a sibling of the screen right
[14:45:06] <uGoMobi> ?
[14:46:03] <uGoMobi> maybe interesting... on opera mobile the popup position is wrong too
[14:46:09] <toddmparker_> makes sense now that i'm inspecting all this
[14:46:12] <toddmparker_> nice fix uGoMobi
[14:46:33] <uGoMobi> but when you close the popup on opera mobile
[14:46:35] <toddmparker_> i don't think opera mini reports offset correctly
[14:46:45] <toddmparker_> WebOS has a similiar issue
[14:46:49] <uGoMobi> you see a flash of the right position
[14:47:05] <toddmparker_> there is no way to know far down on the page you've scrolled
[14:47:08] <Wilto> Nailed it, uGoMobi.
[14:47:08] <toddmparker_> hmm
[14:47:19] <uGoMobi> cool
[14:47:31] <robschmuecker> I'm going to fire up my weiner and have a look at the positioning CSS as interpreted by Opera - if Weiner even works on Opera.
[14:47:33] <Wilto> An absolute element within an absolute element without a relative parent for positioning context was throwing it off.
[14:47:34] <toddmparker_> woo hoo
[14:47:40] <Wilto> robschmuecker: do what now
[14:47:43] <toddmparker_> sorry we missed your solution
[14:48:07] <toddmparker_> snort: " I'm going to fire up my weiner..."
[14:48:09] <uGoMobi> fire up what?
[14:48:14] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:48:22] <Wilto> Might wanna take that up with a physician, bro.
[14:48:22] <robschmuecker> ignore that - if @Wilto's css wizardry has sorted it I can pack my weinre away again !?
[14:48:25] <toddmparker_> weinre?
[14:48:32] <robschmuecker> yes weinre . ..
[14:48:42] <robschmuecker> you guys not familiar ?
[14:48:48] <Wilto> all wieners away please
[14:48:49] <uGoMobi> now i am
[14:48:53] <robschmuecker> :)
[14:48:54] <toddmparker_> lol
[14:49:03] <toddmparker_> "weiner" in english...look it up
[14:49:04] <Wilto> We’ve all learned something today.
[14:49:15] <Wilto> i love this channel right now
[14:49:35] <robschmuecker> just to be clear here . . . https://github.com/apache/incubator-cordova-weinre
[14:50:05] <toddmparker_> crackin' me up
[14:50:15] <Wilto> this is my favorite thing
[14:50:25] <toddmparker_> robschmuecker: no, we get what you're talking about, it's just...oh, nevermind
[14:50:33] <Wilto> Man. I needed this today.
[14:50:39] <robschmuecker> a word from the author "weinre is WEb INspector REmote.
[14:50:40] <robschmuecker> Pronounced like the word "winery". Or maybe like the word "weiner". Who knows, really."
[14:50:52] <Wilto> uGoMobi: You win the King of Voodoo CSS crown for the day.
[14:51:04] <robschmuecker> yes indeed - great effort
[14:51:16] * uGoMobi is still busy laughing out loud
[14:51:20] <toddmparker_> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wiener
[14:51:35] <Wilto> toddmparker_ drops a knowledge bomb on us al.
[14:51:37] <Wilto> all.
[14:51:42] <robschmuecker> yes I am aware of that too - I thought I'd lighten things up a little :)
[14:51:54] <toddmparker_> fun having you around
[14:52:02] <Wilto> There’s a new jQuery Mobile slogan in all this somewhere.
[14:52:08] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:52:14] <toddmparker_> tagline time
[14:52:20] <Wilto> jQuery Mobile: Fire Up Your Weiner!™
[14:52:20] <robschmuecker> no please no - not on my first day !
[14:52:24] <Wilto> oh god i can’t stop laughing
[14:52:25] <uGoMobi> hahaha
[14:52:27] <toddmparker_> "PUt your weiners away, we've got you CSS covered"
[14:52:40] <robschmuecker> hahahaa
[14:52:43] <uGoMobi> i think we need a new logo
[14:52:45] <uGoMobi> :D
[14:52:46] <Wilto> oh god my sides
[14:53:13] <robschmuecker> @toddmparker that's a classic !
[14:53:51] <Wilto> I still wanna know why an empty binding fixed that.
[14:53:59] <toddmparker_> voodoo
[14:54:15] <toddmparker_> alright, uGoMobi - do you want the honor of landing this?
[14:54:20] <robschmuecker> that is too odd . . .
[14:54:37] <uGoMobi> how about the positioning
[14:54:43] <uGoMobi> did you fix that Wilto?
[14:54:45] <robschmuecker> I also have a question as to whether perhaps the BIN css interferes on Opera at all?
[14:54:50] <Wilto> Oh, no, I can drop that in.
[14:54:55] <Wilto> I just confirmed it in the jsbin.
[14:55:13] <robschmuecker> you know the overlay when the page first fires up?
[14:55:27] <uGoMobi> ok lets test again when we have one final JSBin
[14:56:11] <Wilto> http://jsbin.com/akeyaf/88
[14:56:23] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: I wonder if the scroll is the # in the href carrying through?
[14:56:55] <uGoMobi> hmm could be
[14:57:01] <toddmparker_> I like the collaborative debugging in JSbin. Easy to riff on ideas.
[14:57:02] <Wilto> Yeah.
[14:57:30] <robschmuecker> yep.
[14:58:38] <Wilto> http://jsbin.com/akeyaf/91/edit
[14:58:45] <Wilto> Callin’ this one fixed.
[14:59:06] <Wilto> .ui-popup { position: relative; }, and that’s it.
[14:59:51] <robschmuecker> #88  & #91 look good to me
[15:00:05] <uGoMobi> same here
[15:00:26] <uGoMobi> ok lets land it
[15:00:44] <uGoMobi> are we releasing RC2 tomorrow?
[15:01:28] <toddmparker_> i haven't started on logistics
[15:01:32] <toddmparker_> might have to be monday
[15:01:48] <toddmparker_> I need to see if MauriceG can whip up a changelog
[15:02:37] <uGoMobi> ah ok

[15:04:36] <Wilto> …cough…
[15:04:53] <uGoMobi> because here they fail
[15:04:56] <Wilto> I uh yes of course let me just do it again right now to be sure
[15:05:07] <Wilto> Wait, my test fix, you mean?
[15:05:09] <Wilto> Passes here.
[15:05:21] <uGoMobi> nah
[15:05:28] <uGoMobi> only css fix
[15:05:39] <Wilto> …wat
[15:05:41] <uGoMobi> didn't pull your commits yet
[15:05:50] <uGoMobi> let me try FF
[15:06:15] <Wilto> Popup passes here.
[15:06:21] <Wilto> Oh, I had a failing test in `select` earlier.
[15:06:49] <uGoMobi> here too on FF
[15:06:52] <Wilto> Yeah, everything passing for me now.
[15:06:55] <uGoMobi> so nevermind
[15:07:02] <Wilto> MIght’ve just been a Chrome hiccup.
[15:07:12] <robschmuecker> Do we still need to sort out the positioning as I cannot see on the latest bin as the page isn't particularly long whether it's positioning at the top still?
[15:08:05] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: we can test this page now http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[15:09:09] <uGoMobi> maybe have to clear cache
[15:09:35] <Wilto> Alright, I gotta go. Last one out kill the lights, and close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5040
[15:09:38] <Wilto> Later, guys.
[15:09:40] <robschmuecker> it's working but the pop-up is still at the top of the page?
[15:09:51] <toddmparker_> maxlynch: crap, I need to head out. Putting out some bug fires today
[15:09:57] <toddmparker_> tomorrow?
[15:10:18] <maxlynch> toddmparker_: sure, email could work too
[15:10:39] <uGoMobi> later wito

[15:12:02] <uGoMobi> anyway.. good night all!
[15:12:03] <robschmuecker> yes - kind of near there - about 500kms East on the coast.  Yes there are certainly worse places to be :)
[15:12:22] <toddmparker_> we need to note in the docs that mini will open the popup at the top
[15:12:24] <uGoMobi> oh yeah
[15:12:25] <toddmparker_> know issue
[15:12:36] <toddmparker_> thanks robschmuecker

[15:13:20] <uGoMobi> good night toddmparker_
[15:13:33] <robschmuecker> @uGoMobi the test page works good but the pop-up is still opening at top of page so I can maybe have a little hunt tomorrow and see if there's anything that can maybe remedy that?  No thanks to you guys - it's fun really!   I can add that into the docs as a quirk if I don't find any resolution?
[15:13:57] <robschmuecker> there was meant to be a comma between No and thanks !
[15:13:58] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: cool
[15:14:11] <uGoMobi> haha
[15:14:28] <toddmparker_> sure. i'm pretty sure it's not fixable but we can give it a look
[15:14:32] <uGoMobi> let's give that a look tomorrow
[15:14:35] <toddmparker_> k
