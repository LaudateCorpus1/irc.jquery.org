[07:04:32] <toddparker> morning all
[07:13:42] <Wilto> Mornin’.
[07:28:40] <toddparker> hey Wilto
[07:28:58] <Wilto> Yessir.
[07:30:34] <Wilto> Oh, that was a “hey” as in “hello.” I’m like “YES, REPORTING FOR DUTY, SIR.”
[07:32:29] <toddparker> ok, get ready for morning drills soldier
[07:32:45] <toddparker> 20 one-handed pushups, NOW
[07:37:46] <ilogik> hello guys, I'm new here :)
[07:39:53] <ilogik> I thought I'd try to add this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1611
[07:40:29] <Wilto> toddparker: SIR YES SIR.
[07:53:28] <toddparker> ilogik: sure, submit pull request and we'll give it a look - thanks!
[08:04:29] <ilogik> toddparker: I've tried adding an object to $.mobile, version: "@VERSION", but after running make, it's not replaced with the version, is there something I'm doing wrong?
[08:10:52] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: do you guys have time today to test out that orientationchange fix?
[08:13:17] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: https://gist.github.com/9682db09a43f36a9fcc9
[08:13:38] <_nickel> something like that on you local installs + https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/793#issuecomment-2204154
[08:13:41] <_nickel> the instructions there
[08:13:47] <_nickel> *your
[08:19:11] <toddparker> _nickel: will do
[08:19:56] <toddparker> _nickel: should we just test on android 2.1/2/3 and honeycomb?
[08:19:58] <toddparker> iOS?
[08:25:25] <_nickel> toddparker: I tested on Android 2.3, but its a change for all devices so as many as you can I guess
[08:25:33] <_nickel> the only reason I ask (since I know its a pain)
[08:25:41] <_nickel> toddparker: and I tested in the ios simulator
[08:26:08] <_nickel> the only reason I ask is that finding concrete support information for orientation was spotty, but what found looked promising
[08:26:19] <_nickel> *what I found
[08:26:43] <_nickel> toddparker: also, do you have a link to that issue that came from the Microsoft team that's integrating jquery mobile?
[08:27:35] <_nickel> they are building in unobtrusive ajax helpers and their data- attrs are conflicting with ours so it might be good to let thtem know they need to default the namespace for jqm
[08:27:44] <_nickel> since I'm assuming they aren't namespacing their own
[08:28:44] <_nickel> found it
[08:36:19] <toddparker> hey _nickel - can you put that branch on jQM's GitHub, not yours?
[08:36:32] <toddparker> having issues after upgrading to Lion recently using Git front eh terminal
[08:36:48] <toddparker> also, do you have a test page I should look at for testing?
[08:37:28] <toddparker> ^^ on the msft issue, was the that the one where they don't know if a page coming back is jQM or not?
[08:37:34] <toddparker> or something else?
[08:39:07] <_nickel> toddparker: yah I wanted to find it to get that guys github contact info
[08:39:18] <_nickel> I sent him a gitub message to make sure they are using the namespaces
[08:39:33] <_nickel> toddparker: I certainly can push it to the jquery repo
[08:39:35] <_nickel> one second
[08:40:18] <toddparker> thanks _nickel
[08:40:26] <toddparker> lion broke so much stuff - git, apache, etc.
[08:40:38] <_nickel> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/orientationchange
[08:40:43] <_nickel> toddparker: yah I'm not a fan so far
[08:40:44] <toddparker> gracias
[08:40:54] <_nickel> I finally got the adobe vpn set up on my lenovo
[08:40:55] <toddparker> so for testing, what should I be doing?
[08:40:59] <_nickel> toddparker: ah!
[08:41:01] <toddparker> must have been fun
[08:41:03] <_nickel> I have a test page for you
[08:41:05] <_nickel> one sec
[08:41:13] <toddparker> k, thanks
[08:41:16] <_nickel> toddparker: it actually was really easy I was just a moron
[08:41:24] * _nickel notes that it's not the first time
[08:41:36] <_nickel> toddparker: https://gist.github.com/9682db09a43f36a9fcc9
[08:42:02] <_nickel> that should alert the right value depending on how you have the phone oriented
[08:42:06] <_nickel> portrait
[08:42:09] <_nickel> or
[08:42:11] <_nickel> landscape
[08:46:43] <scottjehl> hey
[08:51:49] <kinblas> scottjehl: how's the builder going?
[08:53:56] <scottjehl> eh, working on other things
[08:54:08] <scottjehl> I think we'll just have to say it's coming with 1.0 final
[08:55:54] <_nickel> kinblas: do you want me to look at the dialog prefetch issue
[08:56:03] <_nickel> I'm cleaning up my last critical today
[08:56:28] <scottjehl> _nickel - looks like orientationchange isn't firing on 2.1
[08:56:30] <toddparker> so _nickel - having some mixed results
[08:56:38] <toddparker> scottjehl has some ideas
[08:56:51] <_nickel> scottjehl: its not firing at all?
[08:57:13] <scottjehl> seems it
[08:57:22] <scottjehl> it's firing throttledresize events though
[08:57:38] <_nickel> scottjehl: so orientation is defined on window
[08:58:01] <scottjehl> yeah, I don't think that has much to do with whether the event is supported
[08:58:09] <scottjehl> is it forked based on that property?
[08:58:23] <kinblas> _nickel: what dialog prefetch issue?
[08:58:30] * kinblas checks his latest list
[08:58:44] <_nickel> scottjehl: thats what the support var is based on
[08:58:52] <_nickel> scottjehl: orientation: (('orientation' in window) && ('onorientationchange' in window))
[08:58:57] <scottjehl> right right
[08:59:00] <_nickel> that was proposed by one of the issue commenters
[08:59:01] <scottjehl> oh ok
[08:59:14] <_nickel> maybe try that quickly?
[08:59:38] <scottjehl> so currently it's just looking for orientation in window?
[08:59:38] <_nickel> scottjehl: although from my quick testing I  didn't see onorientationchange being defined anywhere
[08:59:47] <_nickel> scottjehl: so its basically just using the resize
[09:00:06] <scottjehl> ios?
[09:00:11] <scottjehl> should be...?
[09:01:11] <_nickel> scottjehl: yah all it does is check the first one
[09:01:19] <scottjehl> k
[09:01:33] <_nickel> hmmm
[09:03:28] <scottjehl> yep adding && "onorientationchange" in window fixed that 2.1 issue
[09:05:06] <scottjehl> Todd's gonna commit that
[09:05:25] <_nickel> scottjehl: does it still us the orientationchange event though or is it just using resize
[09:05:33] <_nickel> *use
[09:06:07] <_nickel> if so make sure to credit deeple
[09:06:39] <_nickel> scottjehl: https://github.com/depeele/jquery-mobile/commit/798a711a54de4bba8be454c16755f76eb49637a7
[09:07:12] <toddparker> did that change go?
[09:07:58] <_nickel> toddparker: its up on github if that's what you mean
[09:08:53] <_nickel> toddparker: does that accurately detect the feature availability?
[09:08:57] <_nickel> or does it just return false?
[09:09:06] <_nickel> and then use throttledresize
[09:10:36] <toddparker> yep, see that
[09:10:39] <toddparker> who needs credit?
[09:10:43] <toddparker> I'll add a comment
[09:11:53] <_nickel> toddparker: @deeple
[09:11:56] <_nickel> err
[09:12:00] <_nickel> toddparker: @depeele
[09:12:04] <toddparker> thanks, added that
[09:12:14] <toddparker> should il ike to the commit from his too?
[09:13:40] <toddparker> so this commit seems to make it work correctly in 2.1
[09:13:50] <toddparker> it reports the right value for orientation
[09:14:15] <toddparker> however, it only seems to register a change event if i twist the drive to the left, not right
[09:14:19] <toddparker> seems like a hardware issue
[09:15:56] <_nickel> toddparker: is "onorientationchange" defined on the window object of ios or later versions of android?
[09:16:11] <_nickel> I did some basic testing and found that it wasn't
[09:17:19] <_nickel> or thats what I recall
[09:17:23] <_nickel> pulling out my android
[09:19:06] <toddparker> not sure _nickel. scottjehl?
[09:19:46] <toddparker> so both my 2.2 devices ago in a death loop of alerts so the throttling isn't working
[09:20:49] <toddparker> curretn testing:
[09:20:57] <toddparker> Androind 2.1 ans 2.3 = working
[09:21:01] <toddparker> BB6 = working
[09:21:35] <toddparker> WebOS 1.4 = no alerts fired
[09:22:18] <_nickel> sigh
[09:22:50] <toddparker> WP7 = no alerts
[09:25:40] <toddparker> kinblas: i think you need to take a look at this, grumblings in the forums
[09:25:40] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2521
[09:26:50] <kinblas> toddparker: on it
[09:27:08] <toddparker> thsnks kinblas
[09:27:37] <kinblas> ys welksum
[09:30:10] <_nickel> toddparker: can you try binding to win.resize?
[09:30:21] <_nickel> on the phones that don't fire anything
[09:31:47] <scottjehl> yeah throttledresize fired I think
[09:32:56] <_nickel> scottjehl: its probably good to note that the get_orientation function is used everywhere so if that caluculation doesn't work for some reason it might be stuck in whatever oreintation it was before because of the state check
[09:33:04] <_nickel> if ( orientation !== last_orientation ) {
[09:33:54] <toddparker> _nickel: on WebOS, using throttled resize when I switch to landscape, nothing happens. when i go back to portrait, I get 2 alerts, both undefined
[09:34:09] <_nickel> toddparker: for the event.orientation?
[09:34:41] <_nickel> when you say "using throttled resize" do you mean you're binding directly or jqm is using throttled resize
[09:37:38] <_nickel> that is, jqm is using throttledresize to fire 'orientationchange'
[09:40:23] <scottjehl> _nickel yeah orientationchange event uses throttledresize internally
[09:40:45] <scottjehl> resize itself is crashy cathy
[09:41:19] <toddparker> 	<script type="text/javascript">
[09:41:19] <toddparker> 	    $( window ).bind( "throttledresize", function( e ) {
[09:41:19] <toddparker> 	      alert( e.orientation );
[09:41:19] <toddparker> 	    });
[09:41:20] <toddparker> 	  </script>
[09:41:55] <_nickel> toddparker: I don't think that will define the orientation
[09:42:01] <scottjehl> right
[09:42:05] <scottjehl> but it was firing
[09:42:14] <scottjehl> undefined yes, but it was alerting
[09:42:15] <_nickel> hmm
[09:42:28] <_nickel> thats good
[09:43:11] <_nickel> scottjehl: that might suggest that the guard I pasted earlier is preventing the orientationchange from firing eh?
[09:43:33] <_nickel> just eyeballing it though
[09:46:13] <_nickel> scottjehl: how reliablie is clientWidth / clientHeight anyhow?
[09:46:52] <_nickel> I was getting odd results yesterday during testing where the width on my 2.3 device was fixed at 800 some times when the orientationchange fired though I don't know how that would work with the resize
[09:47:26] <_nickel> one would hope that it would behave nicely when working with the "resize" event :P
[09:48:21] <toddparker> crazy how unreliable this is across devices
[09:51:45] <_nickel> toddparker: thank you guy for testing
[09:51:54] <_nickel> I feel lame for dumping it onyou
[09:52:00] * _nickel lacks devices at hand
[09:56:49] <TehShrike|Work> What do I need to be a tester of stuffs?
[09:57:11] <TehShrike|Work> I have a Pre with WebOS and an iPad2 with iOS5
[10:06:53] <_nickel> toddparker: I'm looking into 2212
[10:21:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #76: SUCCESS in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/76/
[10:21:21] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: accelerate elements within the page in touch-enabled scenarios to prevent hidden elements (not just blinking, but flat-out disappearing)
[10:21:21] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: when touch overflow scrolling is supported and enabled, user scaling can create serious usability issues where it's difficult to get zoomed back out. This disables user scaling when that overflow scrolling is enabled (currently only projected for ios5 support)
[10:21:22] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: disabled touch overflow scrolling by default. overridable through $.mobile.touchOverflowEnabled.
[10:28:14] <toddparker> anyone think this is worth looking into now-ish: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2520#issuecomment-2213568
[10:28:25] <toddparker> or give @dgeb some direction
[10:31:42] <_nickel> toddparker: I can't remember why we don't remove the first page but there's a good reason
[10:32:09] <_nickel> more interesting is why it behaves differently after the opt out
[10:32:28] <_nickel> I'll ask for an example of that
[10:36:24] <_nickel> toddparker: posted
[10:36:28] <_nickel> driving my wife to the airport
[10:39:20] <toddparker> thanks _nickel
[11:15:41] <kinblas> scottjehl: toddparker: ping
[11:20:46] <scottjehl> hey kinblas
[11:21:01] <scottjehl> btw ios5 scrolling remains disabled for 1.0
[11:21:08] <kinblas> scottjehl: it's funny how nav bug start popping up just before we ship stuff
[11:21:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #77: SUCCESS in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/77/
[11:21:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> todd: Removed outdated device photo from intro page
[11:21:32] <kinblas> scottjehl: there seems to be a bug in webkit/Safari related to popstate
[11:21:48] <kinblas> I've been debuggin this:
[11:21:49] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2521
[11:22:02] <kinblas> and the problem seems to be that even though a *NEW* document is loaded
[11:22:24] <kinblas> safari is sometimes firing a popstate event with a state object from the previous document
[11:23:20] <kinblas> this popstate event is causing the new document to navigate to the page specified in the state object
[11:23:39] <scottjehl> whoa. that sounds like a security issue
[11:23:45] <kinblas> uh yeah
[11:23:49] <kinblas> it happens only sometimes
[11:23:53] <kinblas> so it seems like a timing thing
[11:24:04] <scottjehl> huh
[11:24:36] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah it's wierd
[11:24:53] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddmparker: any idea why the orientationchange wasn't firing?
[11:24:54] <kinblas> I was going to do a stripped down barebones popstate (no jqm involved) saple
[11:25:03] <kinblas> sample
[11:26:52] <scottjehl> k.
[11:27:04] <scottjehl> _nickel no - been working on other things. toddparker?
[11:30:04] <_nickel> toddmparker: let me try on my 1.6 device
[11:30:11] <_nickel> hopefully it fails there too so I can repro and deal with it
[11:34:48] <scottjehl> kinblas - so this is only when you're externally referencing a page that's still on your domain, right?
[11:35:05] <scottjehl> that happens to be running jQM also
[11:35:20] <kinblas> scottjehl: I just updated the bug with some comments and cc'd you guys
[11:35:24] <kinblas> not sure if you got it
[11:35:28] <scottjehl> yep
[11:36:07] <kinblas> scottjehl: it's all on the same domain yeah ... but still, documents are supposed to be sanboxed
[11:37:13] <scottjehl> right. just creeping into obscurity a little
[11:37:19] <scottjehl> but yeah.
[11:41:50] <_nickel> scottjehl: ok it fails on my 1.6 device, now at least I can debug
[11:41:56] <_nickel> toddmparker: ^
[11:42:03] <_nickel> that is the orientationchange binding
[11:52:17] <scottjehl> ok
[12:16:05] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddmparker: so I've landed at the fact that throttledresize obviously fires a couple times per rotation
[12:16:22] <_nickel> scottjehl: whats the reasoning behind allowing many events but delaying them?
[12:16:59] <_nickel> in general its bad to swallow the events for sure but if they wanted the raw resize events they could bind to them
[12:17:14] <_nickel> bind to *it* I should say
[12:17:45] <_nickel> maybe we need a seperate 'limitedresize' ?
[12:18:20] <_nickel> that permits only one resize per time period since 1.6 appears to be firing many such events
[12:19:57] <scottjehl> _nickel - so it's the difference of throttling vs debouncing, right?
[12:20:41] <scottjehl> of the two, I wanted a continuously firing resize, but not CRASH-YOUR-BROWSER-CONTINUOUS :)
[12:20:54] <scottjehl> ...which you'll find in some popular browsers
[12:20:56] <scottjehl> heh
[12:21:38] <scottjehl> anyway, debounce would mean resize wouldn't fire until the end of a resize, which is nice, but not the expected behavior, especially on the desktop where a resize can take a while
[12:28:32] <_nickel> scottjehl: even for internal use on the orientationchange?
[12:28:51] <scottjehl> for that, one fire would be best yes
[12:28:54] <_nickel> ok
[12:29:02] <_nickel> so if I create a 'debounceresize
[12:29:05] <_nickel> '
[12:29:09] <_nickel> and we don't document it
[12:29:13] <scottjehl> but isn't that what orientationchange's logic is supposed to do already?
[12:29:26] <_nickel> scottjehl: it looks to me like it just binds to throttledresize
[12:29:31] <scottjehl> I thought it tracks if the change fired yet
[12:29:49] <_nickel> scottjehl: you mean the "is it different" guard?
[12:29:54] <scottjehl> right
[12:30:13] <scottjehl> are you working on the bug where it fires to early? is that the issue?
[12:30:26] <_nickel> well the bug has two problems really
[12:30:38] <_nickel> the timing is different on browsers that support orientationchange
[12:30:57] <_nickel> which causes the portrait / landscape value to be wrong because we calculate based on size
[12:31:03] <_nickel> so I've solved *that* portion of it
[12:31:19] <_nickel> by using window.orientation where its available
[12:31:28] <scottjehl> ok
[12:31:56] <_nickel> but the problem I'm seeing now, which I think todd also saw, was that in browsers that don't support it the orientationchange is firing many times
[12:33:20] <_nickel> scottjehl: hmm now it appears to be firing once
[12:33:42] <scottjehl> #markitzero
[12:33:49] <_nickel> lol
[12:33:51] <scottjehl> :)
[12:34:18] <_nickel> "calmer than you are dude"
[12:35:12] <_nickel> scottjehl: maybe that was todd binding to throttledresize
[12:35:21] <_nickel> and I wasn't paying attention
[12:36:19] <_nickel> toddmparker: with the change to $.support.orientation how did your testing fair with "orientationchange" ?
[12:36:29] <_nickel> it appears to be working on my 1.6 device
[12:46:24] <toddparker> _nickel
[12:46:30] <toddparker> i'm back in that branch
[12:47:03] <toddparker> the script i have is this:
[12:47:03] <toddparker> 	<script type="text/javascript">
[12:47:04] <toddparker> 	    $( window ).bind( "orientationchange", function( e ) {
[12:47:04] <toddparker> 	      alert( e.orientation );
[12:47:04] <toddparker> 	    });
[12:47:04] <toddparker> 	  </script>
[12:47:11] <toddparker> is that right?
[12:48:43] <_nickel> toddparker: yah
[12:48:50] <_nickel> was it firing many times for you?
[12:49:04] <_nickel> or were you geting the right results
[12:49:19] <toddparker> firming lots on 2.2
[12:49:28] <toddparker> until i crash
[12:50:31] <toddparker> 2.1 ois ok
[12:50:38] <toddparker> so your 1.6 may work
[12:50:42] <toddparker> something about 2.2
[12:50:46] <toddparker> _nickel:
[12:53:17] <toddparker> is this  afire drill or can we wait for RC2? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2547
[12:57:57] <_nickel> toddparker: looking now
[12:58:26] <toddparker> thanks _nickel
[13:01:19] <_nickel> toddparker: it looks like .text() unescapes strings
[13:01:25] <_nickel> didn't know that
[13:02:38] <Wilto> Scary.
[13:02:50] <_nickel> toddparker: $("<div>foo&amp;</div>").text();
[13:02:53] <_nickel> ==
[13:02:57] <_nickel> "foo&"
[13:03:16] <toddparker> his demo is pretty clear
[13:03:28] <toddparker> so easy to do bad, bad things
[13:03:35] <_nickel> yah I just found the spot in the code where it happens
[13:06:13] <_nickel> toddmparker: in this case its the text inside the option so I'm wondering if using .html would be acceptable
[13:07:03] <scottjehl> yeah that just doesn't seem right
[13:07:11] <scottjehl> $("<p>&lt;script&gt;alert(0)&lt;/script&gt;</p>").text()
[13:07:11] <scottjehl> --> "<script>alert(0)</script>"
[13:07:50] <scottjehl> we probably get text() in other places too
[13:08:39] <_nickel> scottjehl: in this case I think we can use html but it does seem odd that it escapes it for you, and I can't seem to find a way to disable it
[13:08:51] <_nickel> scottjehl: and I'm sure we get text elsewhere
[13:10:50] <scottjehl> looks like we get inner text using text() all over the place
[13:10:55] <scottjehl> like 30 times probably
[13:10:56] <_nickel> toddmparker: I'm not a security guru but I think we've created unexpected behavior for devs using the library
[13:10:58] <scottjehl> throughout
[13:11:04] <_nickel> scottjehl: ugh
[13:11:14] <_nickel> toddmparker: which is bad news bears
[13:11:21] <_nickel> scottjehl: should we consult with the core guys?
[13:12:12] <scottjehl> well, I think it's on us to use .html()
[13:12:22] <scottjehl> $("<p>&lt;script&gt;alert(0)&lt;/script&gt;</p>")[0].childNodes[0] would return escaped text too
[13:13:07] <_nickel> scottjehl: but should text be returning escaped text?
[13:13:17] <_nickel> least surprise and all
[13:13:29] <_nickel> this projet being a case study in surprise at this point :(
[13:13:34] <_nickel> *project
[13:13:36] <scottjehl> yeah I mean, it's just a shortcut to getting inner text right?
[13:14:09] <_nickel> scottjehl: well to be fair the docs do say
[13:14:15] <scottjehl> I think that's correct behavior.
[13:14:18] <_nickel> "he .text() method cannot be used on form inputs or scripts. To set or get the text value of input or textarea elements, use the .val() method. To get the value of a script element, use the .html() method."
[13:14:24] <_nickel> :(
[13:14:36] <scottjehl> we're not doing those though
[13:14:45] <_nickel> the option?
[13:14:49] <scottjehl> we were getting the text node of a select option
[13:15:04] <_nickel> thats not encompassed in "form inputs"?
[13:15:16] <scottjehl> No I think that's literal
[13:15:24] <scottjehl> we definitely use val() in those cases
[13:15:26] <_nickel> not including sub elements then
[13:15:38] <scottjehl> inputs means <input>
[13:15:49] <_nickel> ah
[13:15:59] <_nickel> the value
[13:16:01] <scottjehl> anyway, this isn't just about forms anyway
[13:16:01] <_nickel> hmm
[13:16:08] <_nickel> nope it certainly isn't
[13:16:11] <scottjehl> any dom node that we pull text from
[13:16:24] <_nickel> my example => $("<div>foo&amp;</div>").text();
[13:16:32] <scottjehl> yeah
[13:16:54] <_nickel> scottjehl: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/speed/jquery-basis.js#L3993
[13:17:49] <_nickel> not sure thats the right spot given the directory structure but I couldn't find any other credible references
[13:21:12] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #78: SUCCESS in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/78/
[13:21:13] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: changed the folder name to something more descriptive (textinputs rather than texts), and corrected the documentation language (several factual errors)
[13:21:13] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: updated the nav link to textinputs
[13:21:14] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: removed - changed folder name
[13:21:14] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: removed old file
[13:23:36] <scottjehl> yeah, I just don't think it's a jQ core bug. I think this is what most people would expect when getting text(). How we use it internally is a diff concern
[13:25:24] <toddparker> so is this something we need to change everywhere?
[13:25:32] <toddparker> is this potentially a messy/big change?
[13:28:17] <scottjehl> not sure
[13:28:26] <scottjehl> we do things like this a lot
[13:28:29] <scottjehl> el.attr( "title", el.text() );
[13:28:41] <scottjehl> in that case, html() would not be good
[13:28:49] <scottjehl> it could contain spans, etc
[13:31:21] <danzik17> scottjehl: $('<div/>').html( el.text() ).html()   <------- how i solved that problem in an app i worked on (or something close to it, that's off the top of my head), but that might be too messy for you
[13:32:20] <scottjehl> that'd execute if el.text() contained script right?
[13:32:39] <_nickel> or does .html re-escape?
[13:32:44] <scottjehl> in some browsers
[13:32:52] <danzik17> scottjehl: No, because the container div isn't in the DOM, so it won't be executed, correct?
[13:33:13] <danzik17> That's true at least in the desktop browsers, never tried mobile ones tbh
[13:37:26] <scottjehl> same issue I think
[13:37:35] <scottjehl> var a = $('<div>&lt;script&gt;alert(0)&lt;/script&gt;</div>');
[13:37:44] <scottjehl> $('<div/>').html( a.text() ).html()
[13:37:52] <scottjehl> --> alert thrown
[13:38:05] <_nickel> hrm this is pretty bad
[13:39:41] <toddparker> should we ask someone on core for an opinion?
[13:41:17] <danzik17> scottjehl: Slightly messier than even I remember
[13:41:20] <danzik17> $('<div/>').html($('<div />').text( a.text() ).html());
[13:41:33] <danzik17> It's ugly, but I just tested it and no alert
[13:41:45] <toddparker> fun
[13:41:57] <Wilto> …Wow.
[13:44:18] * kinblas tries to catch up
[13:44:28] <kinblas> what are you guys trying to do? Entity escape something?
[13:44:50] <scottjehl> well that'd be the more direct fix here
[13:45:24] <scottjehl> I guess we need to escape everything we inject if it came from the DOM
[13:45:49] <scottjehl> ...if we're injecting text
[13:47:27] <kinblas> scottjehl: are you guys discussing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2547 ??
[13:48:10] <_nickel> kinblas: yes
[13:48:34] <kinblas> _nickel: great :-)
[13:49:17] <kinblas> _nickel: I've spent the last hour dorking with pushstate and same document url ... browsers handle that case differently ... ew
[13:50:09] <_nickel> kinblas: so if you pushstate with an identical url?
[13:51:16] <kinblas> _nickel: no if you navigate to a file that happens to be the same as the main document
[13:51:55] <kinblas> _nickel: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2521
[14:00:22] <toddparker> so odd
[14:00:32] <toddparker> that is going to be tricky to fix
[14:00:42] <toddparker> could you compare the full paths of each page?
[14:01:02] <_nickel> scottjehl: do we want to just create an getEscaptedText helper to nip this in the bud right now and figure out the rest later?
[14:08:21] <scottjehl> chatting offline for a sec brb
[14:14:12] <_nickel> scottjehl: are you working on the xss issue?
[14:14:16] <_nickel> I'm happy to otherwise
[14:14:55] <scottjehl> yes
[14:15:15] <scottjehl> well, we are going to need lots of changes for it
[14:15:53] <_nickel> yah
[14:16:15] <_nickel> scottjehl: I think a simple helper and .text() replace for now eh?
[14:16:33] <_nickel> getEncodedText or something
[14:16:36] <scottjehl> well, it may be case-by-case
[14:17:11] <_nickel> scottjehl: when would we ant unencoded values from .text() ?
[14:17:14] <_nickel> *Want
[14:17:26] <scottjehl> so this works
[14:17:28] <scottjehl> var a = $('<div>&lt;script&gt;alert(0)&lt;/script&gt;</div>');
[14:17:28] <scottjehl> $('<div/>').text( a.text() ).html();
[14:17:52] <scottjehl> same pattern as above except $('<div/>').text instead of $('<div/>').html
[14:18:37] <Wilto> I N T E X T I O N.
[14:18:44] <Wilto> (I’ll see myself out.)
[14:19:12] <TehShrike|Work> Wilto: are you... making up words?
[14:19:48] <Wilto> Y’know, like, uh, “INCEPTION.” Because there are layers?
[14:19:51] <scottjehl> bahhhhhh
[14:19:54] <Wilto> I don’t know, man.
[14:20:16] <TehShrike|Work> WE'VE GOT TO GO DEEPER
[14:20:36] <scottjehl> Wilto, I think there are other networks to check out, assuming this freenode thing gets old or whatever
[14:21:15] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #79: SUCCESS in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/79/
[14:21:16] <jqm-jenkins-bot> scott: Undeleted some "features" that seemed to keep bugs at bay. Fixes #2545. Fixes #2476
[14:21:20] <Wilto> I hear World of Warcraft is good. Might hit that one up instead.
[14:23:34] <scottjehl> let us know.
[14:24:27] <TehShrike|Work> I run an XMPP server y'all can switch to if Freenode ever disappears :-P
[14:27:47] <toddparker> hey kinblas - first off, you have the best commit notes, just wanted to mention hat I think it needs to say "Fixes #1234". Not "Fix for issue 2529"
[14:27:55] <toddparker> the # is needed to link that up
[14:28:12] <kinblas> toddparker: eh?
[14:28:35] <kinblas> oh you mean github auto links "Fixes XXX"?
[14:28:51] <toddparker> ya
[14:28:55] <scottjehl> :)
[14:29:01] <Wilto> Only if the pound is in there.
[14:29:02] <kinblas> I can never remember that
[14:29:03] <toddparker> and closes it
[14:29:06] <kinblas> oh
[14:29:11] <kinblas> Fixes #XXX
[14:29:16] <scottjehl> yep
[14:29:21] <kinblas> so will it link it if I say
[14:29:29] <kinblas> Fixes #XXX - whatever the issue title is
[14:29:29] <toddparker> yep
[14:29:35] <scottjehl> and close the bug
[14:29:38] <toddparker> no need to do anything manually on the ticket
[14:29:39] <kinblas> or does it have to be on its own line
[14:29:42] <toddparker> nice touch tho
[14:29:43] <scottjehl> no
[14:29:47] <toddparker> very personalized
[14:30:02] <toddparker> just figured you'd appreciate the time saver
[14:30:12] <_nickel> scottjehl: what did you mean when you said it needed to be case by case?
[14:30:16] <Wilto> There are a couple of keywords—“fixes,” “closes,” etc. that close out the issue. Otherwise if you put in like “addresses some issues in #1234” or something, it just links the commit to that thread.
[14:30:17] <kinblas> scottjehl: so the more I play with pushstate on the different browsers
[14:30:24] <kinblas> the more I think it (pushstate) isn't ready for primetime
[14:30:34] <kinblas> browser pushstate impls that is ... not our impl
[14:31:01] <kinblas> the browsers all behave differently for specific cases and its just going to cause us grief with folks running into problems and blaming us
[14:31:20] <scottjehl> yeah, mentioning the issue # will put a comment in that issue's thread
[14:32:05] <kinblas> pushstate is the new vmouse of grief
[14:32:26] <scottjehl> kinblas maybe we should document the downfalls we've found because they all seem to deal with cases that may not occur in site xyz
[14:32:52] <scottjehl> seems to do more good than bad imo
[14:32:55] <kinblas> scottjehl: that's going to be a tough one
[14:33:12] <scottjehl> yeah.
[14:33:22] <kinblas> I spent the last 2 hours playing with a specific case, only to find that the URL you push changes behavior sometimes
[14:33:33] <kinblas> URL format that is
[14:33:41] <kinblas> with hash, without hash, etc
[14:34:20] <kinblas> _nickel: so you are out traveling tomorrow?
[14:38:17] <_nickel> kinblas: indeed
[14:38:44] <kinblas> _nickel: ok
[14:39:57] <scottjehl> kinblas - the alternative is basically breaking the web for non-grade-a browsers
[14:40:24] <kinblas> scottjehl: not sure what you mean
[14:40:26] <scottjehl> I dunno, I agree there are issues
[14:41:01] <kinblas> scottjehl: I'm just flagging that we will experience some bizarre behavior in some cases, due to inconsistent pushstate implementations
[14:41:02] <scottjehl> not using pushstate means an entire jQM-driven site's content is JS-dependent from a linking perspective
[14:41:15] <scottjehl> yeah. we will for sure
[14:41:17] <scottjehl> :/
[14:41:25] <kinblas> scottjehl: and there's little we can do about it
[14:41:32] <scottjehl> for sure
[14:41:34] <kinblas> except maybe file bugs on browsers and wait
[14:42:19] <kinblas> scottjehl: so for issue 2521, I'm about to tell the guy that if he *MUST* externally link out to the same application document, that he needs to turn off pushstate
[14:43:21] <scottjehl> yeah. Sounds like he needs to. Just not sure I'd want to turn it off for everyone
[14:43:43] <scottjehl> also, our docs use pushstate across pages internal and external
[14:44:13] <scottjehl> not always a problem, right?
[14:47:18] <_nickel> scottjehl: so I'm still not clear on why we need to be selective when switching from text() to getEncodedText
[14:47:34] <_nickel> whats the usecase for unencoded html text
[14:47:45] <_nickel> I would think we'd us html in that case
[14:49:03] <kinblas> danheberden: ping
[14:49:07] <scottjehl> no I just mean like, we may not need to use it all the time. In this case, we could use .html() like you said, right? Or if we're just setting an attribute with the text, I don't think it needs to be escaped, does it? Just hinking out loud
[14:49:13] <danheberden> yo
[14:49:24] <_nickel> scottjehl: ah to avoid the extra work
[14:49:32] <Wilto> Aww snap, danheberden is on the case.
[14:49:37] <kinblas> danheberden: regarding https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2546
[14:49:42] <danheberden> I just wrote my first cache manifest file
[14:49:54] <_nickel> scottjehl: ack "text\(\)" js | more | wc -l => 14
[14:49:55] <danheberden> and have spent 2 hours on my phone yelling fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[14:50:03] <kinblas> lol
[14:50:13] <kinblas> danheberden: clearing the cache on ios is difficult
[14:50:14] <danheberden> but, made sure the manifest file was cool
[14:50:23] <danheberden> it's redownloading it
[14:50:30] <danheberden> it's running through charles, and i can see it
[14:50:33] <_nickel> scottjehl: so I can certainly go through and make a judgement call
[14:50:38] <danheberden> also, i made it a php file to force headers and log
[14:50:40] <danheberden> and that's working
[14:50:45] <danheberden> it's just not, like, applying it properly
[14:50:50] <_nickel> any place where we're not using the value in the dom seems to be "safe"
[14:50:57] <danheberden> i need to tweak it to not do new pages
[14:50:58] <danheberden> and see
[14:51:16] <kinblas> danheberden: i guess what I need to see is a sample manifest
[14:51:26] <kinblas> and then an example of a link being clicked
[14:51:29] <kinblas> that doesn't work
[14:51:42] <danheberden> i'm not big/familiar on ios dev
[14:51:48] <danheberden> so the result is pretty un-informative
[14:52:01] <danheberden> just throws an error about not online, blah blah blah
[14:52:04] <kinblas> danheberden: can I hit it from where I'm at?
[14:52:07] <scottjehl> _nickel did you want to take point on this one, then?
[14:52:21] <danheberden> kinblas, lemme see if i can put it up somewhere
[14:52:29] <kinblas> danheberden: thanks!
[14:52:30] <danheberden> i just have it running locally, since we're working to get it done for the conference
[14:53:02] <kinblas> danheberden: just so I'm clear this is an app that is meant to run in Safari right? That is, you guys aren't packaging in phonegap
[14:53:04] <kinblas> right?
[14:53:10] <danheberden> yeah
[14:54:19] <danheberden> kinblas, what's your github username?
[14:54:49] <kinblas> danheberden: jblas
[14:55:11] <danheberden> you can at least look at the code-base - it's under htdocs/m
[14:55:14] <danheberden> just added you
[14:55:17] <_nickel> scottjehl: yah I'm already on it
[14:55:27] <danheberden> i'll psuh the manifest too
[14:55:28] <scottjehl> :) cool sorry to stall you on it
[14:55:33] <kinblas> danheberden: ok thanks, I'm checking it out now
[14:55:37] <scottjehl> danheberden can you add me too
[14:55:39] <scottjehl> ?
[14:55:50] <scottjehl> scottjehl
[14:55:53] <_nickel> scottjehl: its going to need tests for a few of the changes
[14:56:00] <toddparker> danheberden: I'd like to see how's it shaping up
[14:56:15] <_nickel> scottjehl: and np, I just wanted to make sure there wasn't some important reason i was missing with regard to checking each spot
[14:56:37] <danheberden> toddparker added you 'n scott
[14:56:38] <kinblas> danheberden: uh, so how do I get to said sample?
[14:56:57] <danheberden> kinblas heh, when i can work faster :/ trying to get it up and available to ya
[14:57:06] <danheberden> getting slower as i age
[14:57:25] <kinblas> danheberden: oh ok, I was assuming you shot me an url on github mail
[14:57:26] <scottjehl> _nickel nope sounds great
[14:57:36] <danheberden> kinblas i added you to the web-events repo
[14:57:39] <danheberden> so you can see the code
[14:57:43] <danheberden> it's in the 2011-mobile branch
[14:57:47] <danheberden> github.com/jquery/web-events
[14:58:00] <_nickel> toddparker: if you want you can add the scroll position fix that I put in, though I didn't create a corresponding bug
[14:58:11] <_nickel> probably should have so if someone comes across it they can search on it
[14:58:20] * _nickel is over it
[15:00:09] <_nickel> anyone know if its safe to assume that setting document.title will leave the dom unaffected in all browsers?
[15:01:13] <danheberden> kinblas still working on a live demo, but pushed the manifest to the repo
[15:01:16] <danheberden> and here's chrome using it: http://danheberden.com/share/e150ba.png
[15:04:44] <toddparker> danheberden: any tricks to viewing this branch?
[15:04:44] <toddparker> i pulled it down but can't seem to open the page
[15:05:10] <danheberden> i had to setup a vhost
[15:05:12] <danheberden> :/
[15:07:29] <toddparker> eh
[15:07:38] <toddparker> ok, i'll just wait for a preview link :)
[15:08:04] <danheberden> toddparker http://events.jquery.org/beta/htdocs/m/
[15:08:15] <danheberden> ugly way to get it up there, but meh
[15:08:41] <danheberden> i need to jet, pm me if you need more stuff when i'm back on the puter :)
[15:08:53] <danheberden> need some dinner before i perish
[15:15:17] <toddparker> thanks danheberden
[15:15:30] <_nickel> toddparker: I think issue 1243 is in your list twice
[15:16:16] <toddparker> thanks, saw that
[15:16:20] <toddparker> fixed already
[15:16:33] <toddparker> it was so good, we fixed it TWICE
[15:16:38] <scottjehl> so danheberden, the issue is with non-pushstate supporting browsers and appcache? or..?
[15:17:03] <scottjehl> oh sorry - we can catch up later on if you're heading out
[15:20:18] <danheberden> scottjehl i'm not sure what the issue is - ios seems to not be applying the cache properly?
[15:20:34] <danheberden> this is my first dive into it, so im' not very up on anything aside from, like, finding out it isn't working
[15:20:41] <danheberden> but it works great on osx safari and chrome
[15:20:45] <toddparker> guys, i'm heading out
[15:20:48] <toddparker> be on later
[15:20:50] <danheberden> i think just making the page as one page
[15:21:03] <danheberden> ya, i'm officially out too
[15:32:48] <scottjehl> danheberden i'll be on later tonight
[16:18:50] <_nickel> toddparker: http://33.33.33.10/docs/forms/selects/index.html
[16:19:20] <_nickel> multiple custom select at the bottom pushes the counter down when more than one item is selected
