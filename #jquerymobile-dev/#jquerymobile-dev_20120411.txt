[06:13:03] <deAtog> Wilto: I posted a work-around as a comment to the issue I was trying to solve. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3977
[06:13:03] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3977 on jquery-mobile (deAtog; 4d, 21h ago): Page change events poorly documented/implemented
[06:51:20] <danheberden> gseguin having a senior moment - what am i giving you access for again?
[07:06:33] <deAtog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4005
[07:06:34] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4005 on jquery-mobile (deAtog; 33.907s ago): Canceling the beforepagechange event during a data-role="back" transition does not prevent hash change.
[07:10:45] <deAtog> sorry should have been data-rel="back"
[08:32:00] <gseguin> danheberden: a server where I can have a dedicated node instance
[08:32:30] <gseguin> ideally I'd like to set up a push to deploy kindda thing
[08:34:28] <gseguin> same as what's currently on no.de
[08:47:27] <johnbender> gseguin: if you set up a web hook from github please consider the security implications
[08:47:32] <johnbender> https + shared secret
[08:48:16] <gseguin> johnbender: not sure I'm following
[09:02:28] <johnbender> gseguin: we've done webhook deploys from github for other things like the website
[09:03:16] <johnbender> gseguin: but that's an easy thing to exploit in terms of a dos
[09:03:29] <johnbender> especially if it's running shell commands
[09:03:37] <gseguin> oh I meant have a bare repo of the amd-builder on that host with a post_receive hook
[09:03:46] <gseguin> so when you push to it, it redeploys
[09:03:51] <johnbender> exactly
[09:04:01] <johnbender> just make sure you do it with a shared secret
[09:04:13] <johnbender> and preferably over https so that shared secret isn't sent over the wire in the open
[09:04:32] <gseguin> you need to be in the authorized_keys to be able to push
[09:04:50] <johnbender> gseguin: so it's not a webhook then?
[09:05:12] <gseguin> nope
[09:05:13] <johnbender> k
[09:05:16] <johnbender> no worries then
[09:05:26] <johnbender> CARRY ON
[09:05:52] <johnbender> heading into the office
[09:06:01] <gseguin> k
[09:06:35] <Wilto> ur a webhook
[09:06:52] <Wilto> How goes it today, guys? I’m prepping for a talk this afternoon, so I’m more or less off the grid today.
[09:47:10] <toddparker> hey all
[09:47:29] <toddparker> Wilto: looks like we got a pull for that bubble positioning issue
[09:47:39] <toddparker> johnbender: what is our branch plan
[09:48:13] <toddparker> once we tag 1.1 this week, are we going to have a 1.1-stable branch where we make fixes for maintenance releases
[09:48:20] <toddparker> and will the 1.2 branch become master?
[09:48:30] <toddparker> just want to get straight on that
[09:48:53] <toddparker> and are there any pulls you merged into 1.2 that could go into a future maintenance release?
[09:49:41] <gseguin> 1.2 should be merged into master once we released 1.1 and created a maintenance branch for 1.1
[09:53:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/DSrgEg
[09:53:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] In global config docs, change defaultPageTransition to "fade", added deprecation note for touchOverflow. Fixes #4004. - toddparker
[09:57:56] <toddparker> gseguin: perfect. that's what I was expecting.
[10:20:56] <johnbender> toddparker: we'll cut a 1.1-stable branch and merge 1.2 into master
[10:21:06] <johnbender> just what gseguin said
[10:39:30] <toddparker> super
[10:40:01] <toddparker> johnbender: are any of the pulls you merged into 1.2 something we should cherry pick for 1.1.1
[10:40:21] <toddparker> we should start flagging these in the commits [1.1.1]
[10:40:41] <johnbender> toddparker: I thought about that and I don't think so
[10:40:53] <johnbender> toddparker: I only mered one or two and I think they were features
[10:41:01] <johnbender> I will have to go back and look at some point though
[10:41:08] <johnbender> like today
[10:41:13] <johnbender> I'm making a few docs additions
[10:41:56] <toddparker> great and great
[10:42:24] <toddparker> gseguin - you're looking at he builder today, right?
[10:42:30] <gseguin> yah
[10:42:33] <toddparker> cool
[10:42:49] <toddparker> oh - I need help from both of you guys on the upgrade notes
[10:43:01] <toddparker> we need to gather a list of changes between 1.0 and 1.1
[10:43:24] <toddparker> deprecations,  things to be aware of
[10:43:50] <toddparker> going forward, we should keep a file somewhere for adding these as we go
[10:43:52] <gseguin> did we deprecate anything?
[10:43:58] <toddparker> touchOverflow
[10:44:11] <gseguin> oh yeah that's right
[10:44:23] <johnbender> Wilto: toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3916
[10:44:24] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by jokeyrhyme (2w, 2d ago): Issue 3885 nested checkbox/radio inputs within labels
[10:44:35] <johnbender> did that end up in 1.2?
[10:45:57] <toddparker> or 1.1
[10:46:09] <johnbender> right
[10:46:22] <toddparker> don't see the commit referenced there
[10:46:36] <johnbender> guessing 1.2 then
[10:46:43] <johnbender> that's what I assumed but I wanted to double check
[10:47:24] <toddparker> looks like this is in master
[10:47:36] <toddparker> i searched for "nested-label-no-for-test" in unit tests and found it
[10:47:40] <toddparker> (part of that commit)
[10:47:54] <johnbender> :(
[10:47:57] <toddparker> it just makes our markup more forgiving
[10:48:04] <johnbender> right
[10:48:05] <toddparker> is that bad?
[10:48:12] <johnbender> hopefully it's not broken :D
[10:48:27] <toddparker> think we would have heard about it
[10:48:41] <toddparker> i remember talking about this at least 1-2 weeks ago so it was in the rc
[10:48:51] <toddparker> and we have unit tests for the new pattern
[10:49:17] <johnbender> gseguin:  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3874
[10:49:18] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by bjohn465 (2w, 6d ago): Issue 3873: Adding option for clear search button text
[10:49:21] <toddparker> as long as the nested pattern doesn't break the for/id pattern, this is an improvement
[10:49:34] <toddparker> because it's totally broken in 1.0 with that markup pattern
[10:49:45] * gseguin look
[10:49:58] <toddparker> nice feature
[10:50:20] <toddparker> is that in the docs?
[10:50:40] <johnbender>  toddparker diff shows that it is
[10:51:01] <gseguin> yeah the PR had the doc change
[10:51:34] <toddparker> think the data-attr ref needs to be updaed
[10:52:03] <toddparker> not in the PR
[10:53:44] <toddparker> i'd really like to look at the docs and figure out how to keep them u-to-date without so much manual crap
[10:54:09] <toddparker> could the API stuff be devices from the code, etc.
[10:54:14] <toddparker> derived
[10:54:17] <gseguin> jsdoc ?
[10:54:23] <toddparker> ya
[10:54:33] <gseguin> we can look into it
[10:54:46] <gseguin> but that's quite a bit of work
[10:54:55] <toddparker> i figured
[10:55:10] <toddparker> i'd also like to look at how to centralize things like navigation
[10:55:26] <toddparker> if we add a page, there are a ton of pages to update
[10:55:54] <toddparker> it's pretty primitive now which is good because it works standalone
[10:56:05] <toddparker> but if there are ideas on how to make this better, i'm all ears
[10:56:41] <johnbender> toddparker: d91c529beef7c9c3a405e309a3a318669d8e0f33
[10:56:46] <johnbender> that one could go into stable
[10:57:01] <johnbender> it's in 1.2
[10:57:07] * johnbender goes to get the github link
[10:57:36] <toddparker> k
[10:57:41] <toddparker> just keep your eyes peeled
[10:57:43] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/d91c529beef7c9c3a405e309a3a318669d8e0f33
[10:57:44] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by johnbender (4d, 20h ago): Update cached copy of data-url when page already exists in DOM.
[10:57:52] <johnbender> toddparker: there's not much that's been added to 1.2
[10:57:53] <toddparker> right
[10:57:55] <johnbender> just two things
[10:57:59] <johnbender> and I did both
[10:58:06] <toddparker> ok, cool
[10:58:07] <johnbender> the other is a feature
[10:58:15] <toddparker> ok, so that's 1.2 for sure
[10:58:58] <toddparker> i definitely want to take a look at the bugs and feature requests for easy widget and discuss what to do
[10:59:13] <toddparker> we can feed some into 1.1.1 and others fixes into 1.2
[10:59:23] <toddparker> but look at it holistically
[10:59:38] <johnbender> toddparker: are we going to talk about what's targetted for 1.2 tommorrow?
[10:59:39] <toddparker> this is after 1.1final
[10:59:52] <toddparker> that should be the plan, yes
[10:59:57] <johnbender> kewl
[11:00:03] <toddparker> so come armed with ideas
[11:00:04] <johnbender> toddparker: I've been thinking about it alot
[11:00:12] <toddparker> we had talked about popup and fetchlink
[11:00:31] <johnbender> yah I was thinking pick 2 and then attack bugs
[11:00:34] <toddparker> but we can discuss…it's totally open
[11:00:38] <toddparker> agreed
[11:00:41] <johnbender> then maybe 1.3 we can go through the feature request page?
[11:00:47] <toddparker> sure
[11:01:05] <johnbender> maybe do that along with some internal cleanup
[11:01:14] <johnbender> like the refactor for transition handlers
[11:01:16] <toddparker> keeping each release small == good
[11:01:19] <toddparker> yeah
[11:01:36] <toddparker> and little features like adding an option for a clear button on text inputs
[11:01:39] <toddparker> stuff like that
[11:01:56] <johnbender> yah the feature request wiki page is only valuable if it doesn't become a graveyard
[11:02:12] <toddparker> right
[11:02:24] <toddparker> i gotta head to a meeting
[11:02:37] <toddparker> so hit me with emails so i don't miss anything
[11:02:45] <toddparker> thanks guys!
[11:02:52] <toddparker> can't wait to ship 1.1

[12:59:13] <kinblas> gseguin: heh I was just replying
[12:59:38] <kinblas> I can definitely make 3-6pm but I have a commitment afterwards that i'm trying to get out of so I can stay longer
[13:01:26] <gseguin> kinblas: are we supposed to code, help out or just write down bugs as they appear?
[13:01:31] <deAtog> gseguin: kinblas: johnbender: I've got a patch for this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3347
[13:01:32] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3347 on jquery-mobile (offsky; 3m, 1w ago): pagebeforechange being called twice
[13:02:13] <kinblas> gseguin: I'm asking that in the email
[13:03:00] <gseguin> oh ok
[13:03:21] <gseguin> deAtog: not familiar with that bug, reading...
[13:05:29] <gseguin> ok, I would have closed it as not a bug
[13:07:04] <gseguin> deAtog: it's by design that there are 2 pagebeforechange events
[13:07:17] <gseguin> I agree it can be confusing
[13:08:33] <deAtog> gseguin: according to that bug report, most would agree that the event should only happen once
[13:09:27] <gseguin> deAtog: what's you're proposed change?
[13:09:34] <gseguin> s/you're/your/
[13:09:53] <deAtog> split the changePage event in half.. and remove the recursion
[13:10:16] <deAtog> sorry.. split the changePage function in half
[13:10:36] <gseguin> do you have a PR?
[13:10:59] <deAtog> not at the moment, but I can put one together
[13:11:14] <gseguin> how would you achieve the same behavior?
[13:11:27] <gseguin> as in, being able to pass either a string or a jQuery object?
[13:15:19] <deAtog> let me put together a PR and I'll show you..
[13:15:25] <gseguin> ok
[13:17:16] <gseguin> deAtog: before you get started
[13:18:13] <gseguin> the ability to change the toPage (when it's a string at least) is required
[13:21:00] <deAtog> yup.. not a problem
[13:29:01] <johnbender> gseguin: which hackathon?
[13:29:28] <gseguin> http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3322761469
[13:42:31] <deAtog> gseguin: the fix can be found in my repository here: http://desource.dyndns.org/~atog/gitweb/?p=jquery-mobile.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/3347 a pull from "http://desource.dyndns.org/~atog/git/jquery-mobile.git 3347" should work
[13:43:32] <gseguin> deAtog: can you submit a PR on github?
[13:44:52] <gseguin> I can't really look at it this afternoon but I'll put that next on my TODO list
[14:10:26] <deAtog> gseguin: ok, there's a PR on github now..
[14:23:25] <gseguin> deAtog: thank you, I will look into that

[15:30:08] <LakWork> is there any reason why applying a data-theme to a slider does not decorate the generated .ui-slider ?
[15:30:28] <LakWork> that is, a toggle switch
[15:32:25] <LakWork> i'm trying to customize a slider with a theme which makes it have rounded corners- despite a theme which has square corners. the current implementation of the toggle switch only allows me to achieve this by wrapping the <select /> with an outer container
