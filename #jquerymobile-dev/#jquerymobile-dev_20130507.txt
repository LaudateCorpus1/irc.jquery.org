[05:19:13] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:19:31] <uGoMobi> `read
[05:19:32] <b-ot> uGoMobi: From agcolom, 1w 22h ago: the picture here is missing: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/examples/panels/panel-styling.html#demo-page
[05:19:49] <uGoMobi> lol b-ot has good memory
[05:20:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i swear we had the label that way in one of the many incarnations of the rangeslider when we were working on it 
[05:20:22] <arschmitz> but we changed it a bunch of times
[05:21:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes we did, but don't remember we had it outside the div
[05:21:25] <arschmitz> not sure it was a while ago
[05:21:30] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:21:48] <arschmitz> either way though simplifys things a lot
[05:22:00] <uGoMobi> yes for sure
[05:22:19] <uGoMobi> I remember that fieldcontain CSS was a nightmare
[05:22:33] <arschmitz> yeah that was the hardest part as i recal
[05:22:44] <arschmitz> we both tried it a bunch of ways 
[05:23:15] <arschmitz> the events tests are irratating me 
[05:23:29] <arschmitz> when i run them from the browser they are fine
[05:23:45] <arschmitz> but i run them from the command line and the have a phantom timeout every time
[05:24:01] <uGoMobi> annoying
[05:24:15] <arschmitz> yeah makes me wonder if anything is wrong or not
[05:24:22] <arschmitz> and will it fail the build if i push
[05:36:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think i may have found the issue with tap and swipe being weird with delegated events
[05:36:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh that would be nice
[05:37:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah im adding teardown methods for all the tocuh events that are missing them
[05:37:44] <arschmitz> and i realized all our events use setup but setup is designed to only run the first time the event is bound
[05:37:57] <arschmitz> add is what we should use for each time a new one is bound
[05:38:02] <uGoMobi> nice catch
[05:38:10] <uGoMobi> yeah makes sense
[05:38:14] <arschmitz> so any time you had multiple bindings to one of those events it would get weird
[05:39:02] <arschmitz> might be able to close a bunch of issues from this!
[05:39:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was just looking at the event issues
[05:39:28] <uGoMobi> this one maybe https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5954
[05:41:00] <arschmitz> believe it or not vmouse is not one of our "touch" events just tap/taphold, swipe, scrollstart/stop/
[05:41:10] <arschmitz> but i already saw that one and was going to look at it next
[05:41:23] <arschmitz> it sounds like it might be the same problem just in that event
[05:44:06] <uGoMobi> shouldn't we make vmouse part of the touch events some day or is there a good reason to split?
[05:45:41] <arschmitz> thats a good question right now i think its because vmouse is standalone
[06:40:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you around?

[06:47:38] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06touch-remove 140ae9294 15Alexander Schmitz: Touch: make touch events use add instead of setup and add remove events to properly unbind.
[06:51:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[06:52:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: was having tests pass in browser but fail command line thought you might have an idea
[06:53:09] <arschmitz> but i got them to pass both
[06:55:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so all's well then?
[06:55:51] <arschmitz> yup
[06:56:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've just completed one of my first CI projects :) I got the web-ui-fw documentation to build whenever someone pushes to github.
[06:56:20] <arschmitz> nice
[06:56:27] <_|Nix|_> Took me the better part of a week :/
[06:56:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Running on a 300â‚¬ Acer eMachines laptop with a broken display :)
[06:56:53] <arschmitz> did you make your own ci setup?
[06:57:15] <arschmitz> iv always just used jenkins
[06:57:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... a grunt task with a connect Web server running forever.
[06:58:05] <arschmitz> cool
[06:58:21] <_|Nix|_> It's too bad you can't run a grunt task from another grunt task.
[06:58:26] <arschmitz> i saw you asking about it in infrastructure
[06:58:52] <_|Nix|_> I had to grunt.util.spawn( { cmd: "grunt", args: [ "deploy" ] }, function() {} );
[06:59:10] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, this is all pretty new to me.
[07:00:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, while you're here, ... how do we go about the widget review? Do we wait for uGoMobi's "next" branch to land?
[07:00:15] <arschmitz> yeah i think so
[07:00:31] <arschmitz> otherwise we will have to do it again after i thinl
[07:00:32] <_|Nix|_> OK. Good. Just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.
[07:00:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... I've had it where git itself merges incorrectly - completely silently at that.
[07:01:14] <arschmitz> no goo
[07:01:15] <arschmitz> d
[07:01:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i just finished making unbind work on all the touch events
[07:02:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sweet! Saw that. That'll fix a few issues.
[07:02:13] <arschmitz> yup
[07:02:24] <arschmitz> im going though event related issues right now
[07:02:31] <arschmitz> seeing what i can close with it
[07:02:49] <_|Nix|_> Very cool. I'm still re-acclimatizing after that infra road trip.
[07:03:02] <_|Nix|_> Working with node is pretty cool ...
[07:03:54] <_|Nix|_> I found a couple of ambitious-sounding projects along the way which didn't really end up panning out for me. For example, grunt-git.
[07:04:03] <_|Nix|_> Sounds good, right? Well, it'll let you ... commit.
[07:04:19] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:04:37] <_|Nix|_> It's like ... wow ... that's it?
[07:05:14] <_|Nix|_> What about changing branches, pushing, pulling, etc.?
[07:06:04] <_|Nix|_> But anyway ... I'm through with it now, and it works (AFAICT).
[07:06:18] <arschmitz> have you looked at git-tools?
[07:06:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There is such a thing? There always seems to be a library for everything :)
[07:07:24] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez wrote it https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-tools
[07:07:35] <arschmitz> its not exactly what your looking for but might be helpful
[07:08:06] <scott_gonzalez> What are you trying to do?
[07:08:12] <arschmitz> but might help with parsing 
[07:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> node-git-tools is still pretty small.
[07:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> I plan to just keep adding to it.
[07:08:45] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Already done. pull from github and run a certain grunt task from a connect middleware handler.
[07:09:00] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: It's for building API docs in response to a push.
[07:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[07:09:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... so I made a grunt task that launches a connect server that runs forever, and executes the grunt task via grunt.util.spawn().
[07:10:04] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: iv been looking at your node-git-tools trying to figure out the issue with view.jquerymobile.com
[07:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> I should be able to look into that this afternoon.
[07:11:33] <arschmitz> cool im kinda stumped everything i look at when it happens looks totaly fine
[07:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> Working through some UI docs stuff, then Pointer Events WG call, then lunch, then I can look at view.jquerymobile.com
[07:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I know how that feels.
[07:12:20] <arschmitz> well if you want to ping me i can fill you in on what i have found when you get to it
[07:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> Kinda reminds me of the issue we had with the plugins site not updating on post-receive hooks.
[07:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I'll definitely do that before I dig in.
[07:13:01] <scott_gonzalez> What timezone are you in?
[07:13:08] <arschmitz> eastern same as you
[07:13:14] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: If you have another second: Do you know what the landscape is for making $.data work by assigning properties on native DOM elements directly?
[07:13:45] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: It would probably improve performance significantly, but I know that's not possible everywhere.
[07:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: I'm not sure. I know DaveMethvin|away wanted to look into that again.
[07:14:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Cool. I was just gonna ask in #jquery-dev, but I figured I'd ask you first.
[07:14:36] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i can be available basicly any time if i know like an hour in advance
[07:14:42] <_|Nix|_> ... so now I go and ask there as well :)
[07:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Probably around 1pm.

[09:57:22] <uGoMobi> is it report-jquery-mobile-issues hour?
[10:00:08] <gseguin> I guess it is
[10:00:17] <gseguin> hop! this hour is over
[10:00:25] <gseguin> let's close the issue tracker
[10:04:01] <gseguin> uGoMobi, arschmitz: where are we on the demos build?
[10:04:07] <gseguin> are there still issues?
[10:04:36] <uGoMobi> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5969
[10:05:01] <gseguin> ha, sorry I missed that
[10:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I'm ready to look at view.jquerymobile.com
[10:07:42] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok 
[10:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> So you said this happens frequently, but not every time, in production, right?
[10:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> But it doesn't happen for you locally?
[10:08:41] <arschmitz> right
[10:08:59] <arschmitz> since thursday its had a combined total of about 3 hours down time
[10:08:59] <scott_gonzalez> This should be fun ;-)
[10:09:14] <arschmitz> in 5 minute increments
[10:09:27] <scott_gonzalez> And it fails on the same branch every time?
[10:09:34] <arschmitz> its only tags
[10:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:09:53] <arschmitz> and yes it sees a few as missing
[10:09:57] <arschmitz> then gets an error on one
[10:10:01] <arschmitz> and the rest is fine
[10:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know where the script lives in production?
[10:10:43] <arschmitz> and intresting is that its the first ones that are missing one in the mid that errors and all after that are fine
[10:10:46] <arschmitz> yes
[10:11:10] <arschmitz> its in /var/www/view.jquery.com/lib/update.js
[10:11:20] <arschmitz> .jquerymobile.com sorry
[10:12:02] <gseguin> uGoMobi: what's left to do? looks like everything has been addressed in master and 1.3-stable
[10:12:06] <arschmitz> and if checked the fetch head while its down and its fine so its not a git hub issue
[10:12:22] <gseguin> and arschmitz is on view's issues
[10:12:40] <uGoMobi> gseguin: the first issue (tags being removed from view) but it looks like arschmitz and scott_gonzalez are talking about that right now
[10:12:47] <arschmitz> iv also checked the server load while its happeneing and its fine
[10:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm running `grunt cron` over and over and not getting any errors.
[10:13:23] <arschmitz> yeah same here
[10:13:31] <arschmitz> iv done it hundreds of times
[10:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> Have you been able to reproduce it manually on production?
[10:13:54] <arschmitz> no
[10:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> Or does it only fail when actually run through cron?
[10:14:08] <arschmitz> iv only seen it fail on cron
[10:15:21] <arschmitz> im really kinda stuped how its happening randomly but exactly the same every time
[10:17:46] <arschmitz> you have the error output in the issue right?
[10:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:18:47] <arschmitz> iv checked it a dozen times and its exactly the same every time
[10:23:11] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: also it happened way more this weekend then normal when i would think both traffic and server load would be generally lower
[10:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> I just had it happen.
[10:23:36] <arschmitz> when running manually?
[10:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:23:53] <arschmitz> well thats a start
[10:26:04] <arschmitz> did you do anything special or just run grunt cron?
[10:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> I was running ./cron.sh
[10:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> `git tag` is showing all the tags though :-/
[10:26:39] <arschmitz> yeah everything looks fine
[10:26:50] <arschmitz> iv checked all the git files and i dont see anything wrong
[10:27:09] <arschmitz> even checked the sha's to make sure they are correct
[10:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> git-tools is returning all the tags
[10:27:58] <arschmitz> that was where i left off
[10:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I have a thought...
[10:28:12] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-tools/commit/9c77c32a188bf19ec460d58a060b29940212d84b
[10:28:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, this is using 0.0.2.
[10:28:39] <scott_gonzalez> That's the problem.
[10:28:46] <arschmitz> ahhh
[10:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> YAY! Problem solved.
[10:29:32] <arschmitz> explains why i couldnt reporduce local too i have 0.0.3 it looks liek
[10:29:39] <arschmitz> yup
[10:29:46] <arschmitz> thats a relief
[10:30:07] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I can see why you couldn't track this down.
[10:30:18] <arschmitz> its been driving me nuts
[10:30:20] <scott_gonzalez> It took me a while to track down the bug in git-tools.
[10:30:39] <scott_gonzalez> I was running audits against some of the jQuery repos and sometimes the commit counts were wrong.
[10:30:42] <arschmitz> and i looked at node-git-tools but i looked at it on git hub so even if id thought of it i never would have known
[10:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> Scratched my head for a while before realizing I had the wrong event :-/
[10:31:26] <arschmitz> yeah and it makes non sense error output lol
[10:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:33:24] <arschmitz> it was killing me because everything looked fine 
[10:33:37] <arschmitz> thanks you
[10:33:54] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[10:34:57] <scott_gonzalez> This explains why it always fails on the same tag too.
[10:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> The stdout stream is being sent in chunks, and we're just missing the last chunk sometimes.
[10:35:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: well now i know how view works at least ha ha and your node-git-tools
[10:35:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:36:01] <gseguin> Yay! well done guys!
[10:37:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: how did your talk with the hand.js guys go hows all that looking?
[10:38:45] <scott_gonzalez> They're reviewing the work that kborchers has been doing for a special events implementation.
[10:38:49] <scott_gonzalez> We're hoping to get a list of pros/cons for each.
[10:39:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally we'd just use something that works everywhere, instead of creating a jQuery-specific solution with special evnets.
[10:39:24] <arschmitz> yeah
[10:39:27] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully they'll have something for us to review soon.
[10:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> But a new polyfill just came out as well.
[10:39:48] <scott_gonzalez> http://rich-harris.github.io/Points/
[10:39:51] <arschmitz> we need to replace what we have and add pointer support so we are waiting wanting to stay consistant
[10:41:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, pointer events are tough to get right, especially with touch-action.
[10:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> I just wish Touch Events never existed.
[10:42:01] <arschmitz> yeah and ours have enough bugs already without that
[10:43:09] <arschmitz> im curious if these address some of our issues well though i really should set up some demos and test with pointer events
[10:43:28] <arschmitz> like with hadn.js or points.js and the interactions stuff
[10:44:18] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: some of the stuff we have runs into has to do with moving stuff thats being clicked or tapped
[10:45:05] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: like if an event takes place on an object and that event causes the object to move the event will often be triggered on the element underneath
[10:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, yeah, you can use pointer capture to fix that.
[10:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if any of the polyfills are addressing that yet.
[10:46:57] <arschmitz> yeah thats a big one on ios and android
[10:48:17] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: nightmare when you have page transitions lol
[10:49:10] <arschmitz> forced us to not sure our vmouse stuff in the actually library much anymore
[10:49:23] <arschmitz> /sure/use/
[10:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> oy, that sucks
[10:49:52] <arschmitz> yeah so we are pretty anxious to get something better
[10:50:15] <arschmitz> so anything we or espically i can do to help get this stuff going please let us know
[10:50:33] <arschmitz> ( i know your waiting right now )
[10:58:45] <scott_gonzalez> I think testing out the polyfills, and making a list of specific use cases will be the most important things right now.
[10:59:14] <scott_gonzalez> The use cases, especially if you can create accompanying test pages, will be super helpful.
[10:59:43] <arschmitz> ok will do
[11:00:38] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[11:03:33] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: for usecases are you just looking for like pages demonstrating some of the issues that need to be solved eg inconsistnant targets delays etc or ??
[11:04:14] <arschmitz> and then like a little qunit test page if possible?
[11:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> QUnit test pages would be awesome. But even just a page that you have to manually interact with + a sentence or two saying what to do and what should happen would be really helpful.
[11:06:37] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok ill do what i can its all stuff that was written before i was on board lol but the person that wrote it isnt around any more either. so ill do the best i can i know a lot of the issues but im sure not all
[11:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[11:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> Have you guys seen http://livicons.com/ ?
[11:07:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats pretty cool
[11:08:02] <arschmitz> ie6 even
[11:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...it's not open source.
[11:09:18] <scott_gonzalez> You need to purchase a regular or an extended license for every web project.
[11:09:31] <arschmitz> oh yeah code canyon stuff is often like that
[11:10:11] <arschmitz> still pretty cool though
[11:10:40] <arschmitz> but cant say id pay for it
[11:12:20] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it probably doesn't work on dynamic content anyway.
[11:12:35] <arschmitz> thats pretty useless then
[11:13:15] <arschmitz> well neat demo page anyway i guess lol
[11:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> I got all excited when I saw this, because this is pretty close to the idea I've been playing around with.
[11:19:18] <arschmitz> yeah its cool and support looked good too bad its not open source
[11:23:05] <agcolom> I like the rocket icon! But I have no idea whatsoever where i could use it ;-)
[11:23:40] <gnarf> arschmitz: keep a close eye on view
[11:23:51] <gnarf> arschmitz: scott found a potential bug cause - did you see that traffic?
[11:24:04] <arschmitz> gnarf: yeah i was working with him on it
[11:24:10] <gnarf> awesome
[11:24:11] <gnarf> i updated
[11:24:15] <gnarf> so lets hope this solves the problem
[11:24:15] <arschmitz> awesome
[11:24:26] <arschmitz> yeah i still have a monitor that checks it once a minute
[11:24:30] <arschmitz> so ill know if its not fixed
[11:24:40] <agcolom> no save icon :-(
[11:24:53] <arschmitz> my email goes crazy when view goes down
[11:46:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you still here?
[11:46:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[11:46:51] <arschmitz> whats data-next?
[11:47:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just a data- attribute that I used in a demo
[11:47:52] <arschmitz> oh ok
[11:47:54] <uGoMobi> not part of the library
[11:48:23] <arschmitz> so i need to look at the demo then 
[11:48:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it's in the swipe page demo
[11:48:48] <arschmitz> yeah i found it seeing what your doing 
[11:48:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so i figured it's same bug 
[11:48:51] <agcolom> arschmitz: uGoMobi Good evening :-)
[11:49:06] <arschmitz> yeah it is im just seeing about a workaround
[11:49:18] <arschmitz> yup there is
[11:49:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: don't spend too much time on it
[11:49:28] <arschmitz> it's simple
[11:49:39] <arschmitz> just need to pass true as a second param to loadPAge
[11:49:44] <uGoMobi> I don't know what the bug was exactly
[11:49:47] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom 
[11:50:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok

[12:15:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Ping!
[12:16:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Ping!
[12:16:15] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: pong
[12:16:18] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hey!
[12:16:23] <gseguin> hey there
[12:16:25] <gseguin> 'sup?
[12:16:36] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: popup tests are in unit/ even though there's some event sequence stuff going on.
[12:16:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Is that kosher?
[12:16:56] <gseguin> nope
[12:17:05] <gseguin> it should be moved to integration
[12:17:13] <gseguin> but are there some unit tests?
[12:17:13] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK. I'll do that.
[12:17:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah. There are some tests that make sure the enhancement happens correctly, and also that destroy works correctly.
[12:17:44] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Those are sync.
[12:17:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you understand this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2369#issuecomment-17520234 ?
[12:17:57] <gseguin> ok so those should stay un unit/
[12:17:58] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... and they pretty much test the _create() and _destroy() methods.
[12:18:04] <gseguin> cool
[12:18:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: especially the last line "JQM is falling back to the simpler version of changePage" 
[12:18:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK. Great! I'll set up tests/integration/popup with the rest.
[12:18:33] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: thanks
[12:18:47] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: NP! Thanks for clearing this up for me!
[12:19:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: looking
[12:20:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok got it
[12:20:55] <arschmitz> basicly they are theorizing without knowing how jqm works
[12:21:07] <uGoMobi> aha
[12:21:19] <arschmitz> thinking that because the transition stops working we must be doing some fallback
[12:21:46] <arschmitz> and im going to guess they are just overwhelming the device memory with a large background image
[12:22:26] <arschmitz> on long pages most mobile browsers render and transition an image not the actual page
[12:22:36] <uGoMobi> yeah probably
[12:22:57] <arschmitz> so a large repeted background image is probabbly just too much for the browser to handle doing over and over and over again
[12:23:16] <arschmitz> but with NO TEST PAGE how would we ever know ???
[12:23:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: exactly
[12:23:34] <arschmitz> oh man missed its even a retina image
[12:23:42] <arschmitz> man what do they expect from a phone!
[12:23:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but that last comment also sounds different from what the others reported
[12:24:01] <uGoMobi> that was about changing page and immediately going back
[12:24:13] <arschmitz> yeah i think its a different issue all together
[12:24:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok I am going to close and ask them open new ticket with test page
[12:24:56] <arschmitz> sounds good
[12:24:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks for the help
[12:25:21] <arschmitz> not a problem
[12:26:26] <arschmitz> i wish we could have a second field  requireing a link lol
[12:27:06] <arschmitz> and better yet it has to be on either view.jquery.com or jsbin.com
[12:27:18] <arschmitz> view.jquerymobile.com
[12:28:28] <uGoMobi> yes, would be  great if the issue tracker had requirements settings
[12:28:50] <uGoMobi> but Github is changing almost every day, so who knows :)
[12:29:11] <arschmitz> yeah i was excited when they added image uploads for screen shots
[12:29:12] <uGoMobi> I think yesterday there was still a search box to search issues
[12:29:32] <arschmitz> ahh there was for sure
[12:29:38] <arschmitz> i didnt notice it was gone 
[12:29:39] <uGoMobi> well it's gone
[12:29:49] <arschmitz> but i know i used to to search prefetch yesterday
[12:30:04] <arschmitz> why would they do that?
[12:30:12] <uGoMobi> I think it has been removed overnight
[12:30:20] <arschmitz> thats just mean no search
[12:30:37] <uGoMobi> well you can use the search at the top
[12:30:56] <arschmitz> ohhh neat 
[12:30:59] <uGoMobi> but that's not just looking in issues
[12:31:03] <arschmitz> ok thats not so bad
[12:31:12] <arschmitz> yeah at least you can still search 
[12:31:23] <uGoMobi> it even searches all repos if you don't do advanced search
[12:31:26] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[12:31:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it defaults to this repository for me
[12:31:49] <arschmitz> you can change it on left
[12:31:57] <arschmitz> with out going to advanced
[12:32:45] <uGoMobi> ah you are right
[12:33:14] <uGoMobi> only when you go to advanced search page it defaults to all repos I think
[12:33:23] <arschmitz> ah
[12:39:47] <_|Nix|_> Holy cow! Looking at the popup widget docs: <div data-role="popup" id="popupMenu" data-theme="a"><div data-role="popup" id="popupLogin" data-theme="a" class="ui-corner-all">...</div></div>!
[12:40:10] <_|Nix|_> Then, later on, there's another popup named #popupMenu which is the actual popup menu.
[12:40:17] <_|Nix|_> Fixing now ...
[12:43:09] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15JoeOwner opened issue #5978: Select Menus with data-native-menu="false" dont work  02http://git.io/gCXu0A
[12:48:59] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: in the api docs??? 
[12:49:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Nono. In the demos.
[12:49:26] <agcolom> Oh I'm safe then ;-)
[12:49:54] <agcolom> I was having a look in the api docs but couldn't find it ;-)
[13:22:43] <agcolom> do we have a color blind person here??
[13:23:27] <agcolom> gseguin are you color blind? (just to check something)
[13:24:09] <agcolom> if anyone is color blind, could you please check the example at the bottom of this page: http://api.jquerymobile.com/swipe/
[13:24:55] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: You can ask the OP of that bug to verify.
[13:25:39] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes, good idea... 
[13:29:10] <gseguin> agcolom: indeed
[13:30:56] <gseguin> agcolom: what's to check? that the rectangle actually changes color?
[13:31:22] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: The colors for the swipe events look good now.
[13:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You can use Color Oracle to simulate color blindness, but it's a bit of a pain to use: http://colororacle.org/
[13:32:30] <gseguin> agcolom: the quick access at the bottom of the page links to 1.3.0, how do we update that to 1.3.1 and is it possible to make that part of the release process
[13:33:24] <scott_gonzalez> For a Chrome-specific testing tool, NoCoffee is really nice: http://accessgarage.wordpress.com/2013/02/09/458/

[13:55:16] <scott_gonzalez> Color Oracle would be a lot nicer if it didn't disable itself as soon as you do anything.
