[00:06:13] <agcolom> !!!! Problem in master since yesterday evening. !!!! (so about 10h ago)
[00:06:39] <agcolom> On an iPad 4.3.1, jquerymobile.com/test is no longer enhanced.
[00:07:23] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/ is enhanced on that iPad
[00:08:04] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test is fine on iPad ios 5.1 and iOS 5.0.1
[00:11:08] <agcolom> Can reproduce in simulator for iOS 3 and iOS 4
[00:11:41] <agcolom> johnbender, _|Nix|_, gseguin, toddparker, Wilto ^^^
[00:13:31] <agcolom> it was working 13h ago, and we noticed the problem 10h ago (on custom code so I thought there was a problem with the code) only tested this morning (i.e. now) on  http://jquerymobile.com/test
[00:47:44] <johnbender> agcolom: thanks for the heads up
[00:47:53] <johnbender> I'll get them to do a bisect tommorrow
[00:48:04] <johnbender> is there anything in the log that would suggest a change targetted at ios?
[00:52:01] <agcolom> johnbender not that I can spot easily... Some changes to some components but nothing obvious...
[00:57:14] <agcolom> johnbender: interesting the singl page template works: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-template.html
[00:58:03] <agcolom> and multi page template works as well. These have no components other than button links...
[00:58:59] <agcolom> I am thinking this could be due to one of the changes to the components that occurred last night. Maybe iOS 3 or 4 do not understand some of the new rules....
[05:45:34] <agcolom> Testing from my iPad...
[05:55:29] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hey! Wondering if it's still broken ...
[06:01:06] <agcolom> Hi I can't test right now... I'm in a meeting ;-)
[06:03:51] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ actually I forgot this iPad was a 4.3.3 and yes it is still broken
[06:11:02] <agcolom> I can test stuff while in the meeting if that helps...
[07:09:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] jasondscott pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/9UXjEQ
[07:09:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixing master - Broken for iOS 4.3.1 and lower - Jason Scott
[07:10:10] <JasonDScott> Should be fixed now
[07:11:14] <agcolom> ok, testing now...
[07:13:00] <agcolom> Jason, you're a star :-) all fixed thank you :-)
[07:15:14] <JasonDScott> agcolom: np, glad I could help : )
[07:33:54] <Wilto> I hear everything is broken forever; is this true?
[07:42:56] <scott_gonzalez> Does jquery.mobile.event.js really depend on jquery.mobile.core.js?
[08:14:09] <toddparker> gseguin - no note in the lab
[08:16:59] <toddparker> thanks for that fix JasonDScott
[08:20:48] <toddparker> scott_gonzalez: We were going to look at that, a few of these utilities may not need core so we could probably remove that dependency but we wanted to dig and and analyze this
[08:20:50] <_|Nix|_> Sorry, everybody! I caused it ...
[08:21:00] * _|Nix|_ goes and hides under a rock
[08:21:01] <toddparker> gseguin was going to give this a look in a bit
[08:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: Ok. It'd be really nice if events could be easily be used outside of mobile.
[08:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> Right now the deps are pretty steep.
[08:21:41] <scott_gonzalez> events -> support -> media, etc.
[08:21:50] <toddparker> exactly
[08:21:54] <toddparker> vmouse too
[08:22:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, but at least vmouse doesn't have deps :-)
[08:22:23] <toddparker> good, thought i did for some reason
[08:23:09] <toddparker> so zoom and orientation fix need core ATM, those utils should be standalone too
[08:23:19] <toddparker> this has been on our last 3 weekly agendas
[08:23:34] <scott_gonzalez> You could always split out the different types of events.
[08:23:45] <toddparker> if you want to look at this with gseguin that would be cool. not sure if you have time
[08:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> The requests I've had from clients have just been for touch or fast click.
[08:23:52] <toddparker> exactly
[08:23:56] <toddparker> i hear that too
[08:24:15] <toddparker> the more we can break out these into standalone, the better
[08:24:27] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, I can have a quick chat with gseguin about splitting up the files for easier consumption :-)
[08:24:35] <toddparker> our first decoupling pass was more about removing widgets, transitions, etc.
[08:24:49] <toddparker> next pass in ensuring the smallest pieces can be used by themselves
[08:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[08:24:58] <toddparker> sweet, thanks scott_gonzalez
[08:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> Hey, while I've got you, can you or scottjehl take a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/619
[08:25:12] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (2m, 4d ago): Progressbar: Add ability to set value: false for an indeterminate progressbar. Fixes #7624 - Progressbar: Support value: false for indeterminate progressbar
[08:25:16] <toddparker> reps should be core only
[08:25:17] <toddparker> ideally
[08:25:30] <toddparker> sometimes, we need support tests
[08:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, and it's definitely nice to reuse elements for all support tests.
[08:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling you don't need test elements for support tests related to events though.
[08:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> So we could probably split out the support tests. Not sure how clean it would be though.
[08:28:05] <scott_gonzalez> Especially since it would still leave multiple deps.
[08:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> But at least the deps would be smaller.
[08:42:16] <toddparker> yeah agreed scott_gonzalez - this is all stuff I want to do ASAP so would appreciate your eyes on this
[08:42:23] <toddparker> esp. since you have an outside perspective
[08:43:55] <toddparker> johnbender would be a good person to ask too, esp. is gseguin isn't working today
[08:45:11] <_|Nix|_> Oh, he isn't? ... cuz I was gonna ask him about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4340
[08:45:11] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4340 on jquery-mobile (mruffolo; 2w, 5d ago): slow response when clicking item in large listview on mobile devices
[08:46:19] <toddparker> not sure _|Nix|_ - i always for get what days gseguin works
[08:46:40] <toddparker> please add items to today's agenda - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i3cHUre22BreB3BwkTu5EjFImYL0-zup4WS7gUS9w7I/edit
[08:50:08] <gseguin> Good morning all
[08:50:16] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[08:50:31] * gseguin is catching up
[08:50:45] <toddparker> scott_gonzalez is looking at the deps for events today…what we talked about last week
[08:51:12] <uGoMobi> hey all
[08:51:23] <toddparker> basically, try to only have jQ core as the dep for most of our utils especially
[08:53:46] <gseguin> toddparker: I can start by that today
[08:53:58] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: are you already working on it?
[08:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Nope, I was just looking at the deps because a client wants to pull in the event code.
[08:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> and events.js has a deep dependency chain
[08:55:17] <scott_gonzalez> Which probably isn't necessary for the stuff they want (touch events)
[08:55:38] <gseguin> It's most likely so the $.mobile namespace is defined
[08:55:41] <gseguin> isn't it?
[08:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> Usually the clients just need gestures and/or fast click.
[08:56:25] <scott_gonzalez> $.mobile is only used for orientationchange.
[08:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> Could easily split that out from the touch and gesture events.
[08:57:00] <scott_gonzalez> There's also a dependency on support.js, which has other deps like media.js
[08:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> And the support deps are actually just touch and orientation.
[08:57:35] <scott_gonzalez> And the touch support test itself is one line of code.
[08:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> touch support could easily be moved into something like touchevents.js, along with the touch related code
[08:58:28] * gseguin opens up all the files
[08:58:30] <scott_gonzalez> Which would probably remove all deps (other than vmouse, which should stay)
[09:00:41] <gseguin> on it
[09:06:08] <toddparker> this is a very popular request
[09:06:17] <toddparker> think someone already forked for just events
[09:06:24] <toddparker> repo somewhere
[09:07:26] <gseguin> toddparker: I'm on jQM today and tomorrow
[09:08:56] <toddparker> cool
[09:17:04] <maxlynch> hey guys, I'm trying to emulate the lion/iOS scrollbar on jQuery Mobile for desktop (no-width scrollbars). Anyone know if someone has done this before?
[09:18:45] <_|Nix|_> maxlynch: I believe the scrollview may have that, if I understood "no-width scrollbars" correctly ...
[09:20:13] <agcolom> Hey good morning/afternoon all
[09:20:17] <kinblas> maxlynch: you talking about the positional feedback (gray bar)?
[09:20:29] <maxlynch> Oh sweet, yea, that looks like exactly what I want
[09:20:51] <kinblas> maxlynch: yeah what _|Nix|_ said
[09:23:10] <maxlynch> Thanks, I'll mess around with this a bit and see how it works for my needs
[09:26:54] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[09:54:43] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[10:47:28] <toddparker> maxlynch: i think scroll has that too
[10:48:03] <maxlynch> toddparker: what is scroll?
[10:48:13] <toddparker> sorry iscroll
[10:48:28] <toddparker> autocorrect!
[10:48:38] <toddparker> so anyone have agenda items?
[10:48:54] <maxlynch> Thanks :)
[10:50:38] <uGoMobi> toddparker: added already in agenda
[10:50:47] <gseguin> toddparker: decoupling
[10:51:55] <agcolom> toddparker: added donation page to the agenda.
[10:53:16] <Wilto> Think I’m just gonna listen in from afar today, guys.
[10:53:19] <Wilto> Kinda swamped.
[10:54:29] <Wilto> If you can bear to carry on without me, I mean.
[10:56:17] <toddparker> cool, thanks
[10:56:24] <toddparker> so the new meeting plan is this:
[10:57:01] <toddparker> at 2:00, we'll have a quick 5-10 minute check-in on #jquery-meeting IRC
[10:57:09] <toddparker> quick status check for each person
[10:57:28] <toddparker> after that, we'll ask if anyone from the community has questions
[10:57:33] <toddparker> then wrap up
[10:57:47] <gseguin> so no more G+ hangout?
[10:58:04] <toddparker> we can then hop onto the G+ hangout to hash out issues that will be easier discussed verbally
[10:58:09] <toddparker> so a two parter
[10:58:40] <gseguin> ok, let me know when to kick it off then
[10:58:41] <toddparker> we can even have the hangout up front, but really focus on just using IRC f
[10:58:43] <toddparker> k
[10:58:58] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:59:20] <gseguin> alright then I kicked it off
[10:59:55] <gseguin> I'll start the hang out
[11:00:18] <gseguin> you guys join whenever
[11:00:26] <gseguin> it's in your G+ stream
[11:01:27] <toddparker> ok
[11:06:49] <agcolom> sorry completely forgot my password! I'm resetting in...
[11:11:42] <deAtog> _|NIx|_: I'm trying to script a popup containing a dialog.. but am not getting anything to display but the overlay
[11:12:31] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: Please send an example my way  ...
[11:15:41] <deAtog> _|Nix|_: load this: http://dev.itreetools.org/ellingsd/streets/mobile/?key=SAMPLEPROJZ4FBC3933Z33B09Z26B79242 followed by this http://dev.itreetools.org/ellingsd/streets/mobile/?key=SAMPLEPROJZ4FBD37D1Z36E4DZ4C614655
[11:16:02] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: Gimme about an hour, OK?
[11:16:10] <deAtog> the second one should cause it to display a dialog in a popup immediately
[11:16:11] <deAtog> sure
[11:43:39] <deAtog> JasonDScott: I'm confused by this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/15f404e638596e7b9cccd6210fb66ffc04899443 why not just: return /^#[^#]+$/.test(hash); inside isHashValid? IE a valid hash is a string that starts with a # followed by and ends with one or more characters that's not a #
[11:43:40] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by jasondscott (5d, 18h ago): Moved hash validation into $.mobile.path.isHashValid  Added unit tests for isHashValid
[12:34:51] <agcolom> So here are the PRs I'd like someone to confirm as OK before I pull in:
[12:35:00] <agcolom> I'll do one at a time...
[12:35:01] <agcolom> https://github.com/chetankjain/jquery-mobile/commit/8619c7541f6dec224d8f8816534fcf1ca408d755

[12:42:24] <JasonDScott> deAtog: Thanks, I have pushed the update
[12:44:55] <agcolom> Wilto, gseguin I can't actually add in review to those as they are Pull Requests.
[12:45:04] <Wilto> Oh, right.
[12:45:26] <agcolom> Wilto one is  https://github.com/chetankjain/jquery-mobile/commit/8619c7541f6dec224d8f8816534fcf1ca408d755

[12:51:27] <agcolom> basically, most PRs by chetankjain
[12:52:14] <agcolom> It might be easier to actually add a comment on GitHub and I'll be able to catchup and merge if they're ok.
[13:19:10] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom 1.1-stable build #48: UNSTABLE in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%201.1-stable/48/
[13:21:09] <agcolom> gseguin wilto? quick question on swipe
[13:21:18] <gseguin> sure?
[13:21:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/Nfarmw
[13:21:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #4450 Docs: Add configuration for virtual mouse events - Chetan K Jain
[13:21:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #4451 from chetankjain/patch-15 - Ghislain Seguin
[13:21:59] <agcolom> if I look at the code, a swipe is more than 30px horizontally and less than 75px vertically
[13:22:31] <agcolom> Is this normal? (75px vertical seems big compared to 30px horizontal)
[13:23:19] <gseguin> kinblas: ^
[13:23:39] <agcolom> I'm looking at jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.js
[13:25:41] <agcolom> What is strange is the docs say more than 30px horizontally and less than 20px vertically
[13:25:47] <agcolom> so one is incorrect...
[13:27:00] <gseguin> verticalDistanceThreshold: 75,
[13:28:33] <agcolom> yes, but what is strange is you can have a swipe that is more vertical than horizontal....and is taken as a horizontal swipe
[13:29:16] <agcolom> so the docs say "swipe
[13:29:16] <agcolom>     Triggers when a horizontal drag of 30px or more (and less than 20px vertically) occurs within 1 second duration but these can be configured:"
[13:29:28] <gseguin> I guess it's because it's hard to draw a straight light with you finger
[13:29:30] <agcolom> that 20px should be replaced by 75?
[13:29:57] <gseguin> I believe so
[13:30:18] <agcolom> should I check with someone else to be sure?
[13:30:31] <gseguin> kinblas or scottjehl
[13:30:41] <agcolom> Ok, Thanks :-)
[13:30:49] <gseguin> you're welcome
[13:31:34] <agcolom> quick git question:
[13:32:20] <agcolom> if I do a fetch/rebase then modify master locally...
[13:32:35] <gseguin> ok
[13:32:55] <agcolom> do I then do a git push upstream master?
[13:36:03] <gseguin> after you commited yeah
[13:36:48] <agcolom> How do I commit? (git commit -m "my message here")?
[13:37:49] <gseguin> $ git add <path-to-your-file>
[13:38:10] <gseguin> $ git commit -m "<commit-message>"
[13:38:35] <agcolom> but if the file already exists?
[13:39:18] <agcolom> (I means already exists in master)
[13:39:47] <gseguin> you always need to add before you commit
[13:40:32] <agcolom> really? I didn't know that. I thought git add was to put new files under git.
[13:40:54] <gseguin> nope, it's not like svn add
[13:41:12] <agcolom> sorry I don't know svn either :-(
[13:41:25] <agcolom> so say I modify hello.txt
[13:41:46] <agcolom> I then do git add hello.txt
[13:42:07] <agcolom> git commit -m "modified hello"
[13:42:18] <agcolom> Ah I think I get it...
[13:42:30] <gseguin> yep
[13:42:46] <agcolom> is it because in git commit you don't specify which file the commit is for?
[13:43:03] <agcolom> so using git add you say which one it's for?
[13:43:04] <gseguin> if you do that then git will do the add for you
[13:43:30] <agcolom> so then imagine I modify hello.txt again.
[13:43:42] <agcolom> I do again git add hello.txt
[13:43:49] <gseguin> yeah
[13:43:56] <agcolom> and then git commit -m "modified hello again"
[13:44:00] <gseguin> that adds it to the index (staging area)
[13:44:08] <agcolom> ok
[13:44:16] <gseguin> that create a commit with all the files in the staging area
[13:44:42] <agcolom> and then git push upstream master
[13:45:19] <gseguin> push is like "share my changes"
[13:45:32] <gseguin> yep
[13:45:41] <agcolom> just one more question.... if I modify hello1.txt and hello2.txt
[13:46:08] <agcolom> can I do git add hello1.txt
[13:46:15] <agcolom> git add hello2.txt
[13:46:21] <gseguin> yeah or
[13:46:36] <gseguin> $ git add hello1.txt hello2.txt
[13:46:37] <agcolom> git commit "modified hello1 and 2"
[13:46:42] <agcolom> cool
[13:47:02] <agcolom> and then git commit "modified hello1 and 2" ?
[13:47:29] <gseguin> yep with a -m
[13:47:42] <agcolom> ah yes, -m , and then git push upstream master
[13:47:57] <gseguin> indeed
[13:48:49] <agcolom> if I then cherry-pick I can see the commit in github and it would be the one that has added hello1 and 2 or do I cherry-pick them separately?
[13:50:26] <gseguin> when you git add, that does not create a commit
[13:50:47] <gseguin> only git commit will do that
[13:50:59] <gseguin> so if your commit includes the 2 files
[13:51:00] <agcolom> yes, I mean the commit in github that shows the push
[13:51:10] <gseguin> then you just have to cherry pick that commit
[13:51:29] <gseguin> if you've commited each file change in a separate commit
[13:51:42] <gseguin> then you'll need to cherry pick the 2 commits
[13:52:01] <agcolom> perfect! Thank you so much
[13:52:26] <agcolom> goodnight...
[13:53:10] <gseguin> you're welcome
[13:53:20] <gseguin> good night Anne, see you later
[13:53:23] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[13:53:40] <uGoMobi> one quick question from me about all this Git stuff...
[13:53:47] <uGoMobi> upstream? not origin?
[13:54:17] <gseguin> it depends on how you named your remotes
[13:54:19] <uGoMobi> i have only one remote and its called origin
[13:54:26] <gseguin> upstream and origin are conventions
[13:54:30] <uGoMobi> oh ok, you can rename it
[13:54:39] <uGoMobi> i have that for my forked repo
[13:54:41] <gseguin> they're just pointers to a remote git repo
[13:54:58] <uGoMobi> i thought you couldnt rename it for the cloned jquery repo
[13:55:09] <uGoMobi> yeah, just double checking
[13:55:12] <uGoMobi> thanks
[13:55:22] <gseguin> no problem
[14:05:00] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/MYjnkg

[15:04:25] <toddparker> i'd be ok with that
[15:04:30] <toddparker> there are a lot of files
[15:04:45] <toddparker> heading out, sorry i was MIA
[15:04:51] <gseguin> and the filenames are getting longer and longer
[15:05:00] <gseguin> ok, I'll do that next
[15:06:58] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: is going through our builder a step you would mind?
[15:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> I would be upset if that was a requirement to get the event code.
[15:08:33] <gseguin> by event code you mean the touch events?
[15:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[15:09:13] <gseguin> well it does have a dep on $.support.touch (which is one line I know) and vmouse
[15:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> vmouse is fine
[15:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> Any reason $.support.touch can't move to the event file?
[15:09:40] <gseguin> so the builder would resolve these deps for you and give a js file with just what you need
[15:10:03] <gseguin> So I moved $.support.touch to it's own module
[15:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> Where else is it used?
[15:10:31] <gseguin> in support.js
[15:10:45] <gseguin> sorry
[15:10:52] <gseguin> nowhere else
[15:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> So why put it in its own module?
[15:12:00] <gseguin> so support.js can pull it for folks who want only support.js
[15:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[15:12:08] <gseguin> does that make sense?
[15:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> no
[15:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> $.support is not a public API
[15:13:04] <gseguin> ok, back to the drawing board
[15:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> It's an implementation detail that is subject to change without warning.
[15:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> Why back to the drawing board? Just move $.support.touch to event.js
[15:17:28] <gseguin> the thing is it's not sure that $.support.touch won't be needed by any other module in the near future
[15:17:47] <gseguin> is it?
[15:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> It's not needed today and hasn't been for the entire existence of the project, right?
[15:18:57] <gseguin> I believe so
[15:24:32] <johnbender> I thought we exposed support on purpose
[15:24:38] <johnbender> so that others could make use of the value
[15:24:41] <johnbender> which is what we discussed on the call
[15:24:52] <gseguin> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[15:25:26] <gseguin> I mean yes the attributes we add to it are not documented so it's not officially public
[15:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> "Primarily intended for jQuery's internal use; specific properties may be removed when they are no longer needed internally to improve page startup performance."
[15:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> They're exposed, but they're technically internal.
[15:28:23] <gseguin> ok
[15:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> They don't have the same stability as anything else that's publicly exposed.
[15:30:05] <gseguin> actually buttonMarkup is using $.support.touch
[15:36:08] <scott_gonzalez> I can't tell why it's dealying class changes for touch devices.
[15:36:25] <scott_gonzalez> I assume that's going to break at some point anyway.
[15:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> If it's needed for some reason, it should probably be based on the actual event, not support for touch events.
[15:37:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking of what happens when a device supports touch + mouse.
[15:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> Presumably you want that branching to happen based on the actual pointer device.
[15:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> But again, I don't know why that branch exists in the first place, so it's hard to tell.
[15:38:37] <gseguin> agreed but that's not the point here
[15:39:07] <gseguin> the question was is $.support.touch used anywhere else
[15:40:00] <gseguin> it is
[15:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> But why?
[15:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> And is the use correct?
[15:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> Without answers to those, the "yes" doesn't really matter.
[15:41:54] <gseguin> I don't know the answer to that question
[16:01:26] <johnbender> gseguin: for buttonMarkup?
[16:01:45] <johnbender> I assume you guys are talking about the delay for the highlighted state?
[16:01:51] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: ^
[16:05:48] <gseguin> yes
[16:06:08] <johnbender> we attempt to prevent the higlighted state on a scroll
[16:06:12] <johnbender> link in a long list view
[16:06:23] <johnbender> highlighting the button when it's scrolling looks like crap
[16:06:34] <johnbender> but it doesn't matter when there isn't touch support
[16:08:15] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez's concern was whether it really needed $.support.touch
[16:08:22] <johnbender> right
[16:08:26] <johnbender> seems like it does no?
[16:08:37] <johnbender> I have to double check the code though
[16:08:46] * johnbender is still working feverishly on his preso
[16:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like the check should be /^touch/.test( event.originalEvent.type )
[16:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: My thought is that you don't want the delay if the user is not using his fingers on a device that supports multiple pointer devices, including touch.
[16:10:18] <johnbender> oohh
[16:10:21] <johnbender> that sounds nice :D
[16:10:31] <johnbender> I like the late binding there too
[16:10:41] <johnbender> future friendly
[16:10:48] <johnbender> if that will work I'm for it
[16:11:15] <johnbender> hmm
[16:11:16] <johnbender> well
[16:11:19] <scott_gonzalez> Making decisions on what to do based on capabilities seems sane, but is almost always wrong :-/
[16:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> Everyone falls into that trap.
[16:11:25] <scott_gonzalez> EVERYONE
[16:11:30] <johnbender> assuming there isn't some later addition to the touch criteria
[16:11:48] <johnbender> but that seems unlikely
[16:11:58] <johnbender> we do some crazy stuff excluding devices
[16:12:36] <gseguin> alright so  /^touch/.test( event.originalEvent.type ) to replace $.support.touch in btnMarkup
[16:12:44] <scott_gonzalez> + a comment :-)
[16:13:22] <gseguin> like: //Making decisions on what to do based on capabilities seems sane, but is almost always wrong
[16:13:25] <gseguin> :P
[16:14:06] <gseguin> then $.support.touch is out
[16:14:19] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[16:14:32] <gseguin> we test for touch support in the touch event code and boom!
[16:15:21] <scott_gonzalez> a comment like: // Use a short delay to determine if the user is scrolling before highlighting
[16:15:40] <gseguin> ok
[16:24:21] <johnbender> gseguin: I wonder if people are forcing that value for any reason
[16:24:40] <johnbender> I guess we discussed that though
[16:24:42] <johnbender> it's not documented
[16:24:51] <johnbender> nevermind
[16:24:53] * johnbender needs to focus
[16:24:57] <gseguin> yup, use at your own risks
[16:56:56] <gseguin> tada!

[21:55:11] * gseguin gives himself a slap in the face for pushing without running the tests

[21:59:46] <gseguin> it still has a dependency on vmouse
