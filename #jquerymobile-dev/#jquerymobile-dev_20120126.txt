[07:11:37] <Wilto> Morning, guys.
[08:06:59] <johnbender> gseguin: do you have access to jquerymobile.com?
[08:07:14] <johnbender> or that server that runs it
[08:07:18] <johnbender> s/or/rather/
[08:08:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I think eddie had it responding with a 301 which means a permanent redirect which browsers might cache for "a while" from my research :(
[08:09:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah it's a Redirect Permanent in the httpd conf
[08:09:41] <johnbender> or rather, it was
[08:12:29] <toddmparker_> i see johnbender
[08:12:35] <toddmparker_> so that's why i'd bounce over?
[08:21:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/sQM7jg
[08:21:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] TODO update jquery version in tag replace - John Bender
[08:26:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I *think* so
[08:26:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm not sure gseguin has access to the server, though I don't really know
[08:26:52] <johnbender> checking
[08:29:14] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I don't see anything in the authorized keys that would suggest that he has access to the server
[08:30:16] <toddmparker_> ok
[08:30:21] <toddmparker_> is this a Q for danheberden
[08:30:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: to grant him access yes
[08:30:51] <danheberden> who access?
[08:30:56] <johnbender> danheberden: gseguin
[08:31:01] <danheberden> OMG NOT THAT GUY
[08:31:04] <johnbender> I don't know that he wants it though
[08:31:08] <johnbender> PAGER DUTY
[08:31:26] <danheberden> ya, go for it bro
[08:31:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm 99.999999 percent sure he doesn't have access
[08:32:20] <johnbender> though there is one key in the file that doesn't have a user@host pair
[08:33:47] <danheberden> johnbender i hvae his key
[08:33:49] <danheberden> if you'd like me to add it
[08:34:09] <johnbender> danheberden: no need
[08:34:15] <johnbender> danheberden: though I'll ask him
[08:34:30] <danheberden> (and his keys have his user@host pair - he has two keys)
[08:34:32] <johnbender> I'm going to institute a "don't monkey with the makefile unless you have access policy"
[08:34:38] <danheberden> haha
[08:34:40] <danheberden> i like it1
[08:34:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[08:35:25] <toddmparker_> +1
[08:35:36] <toddmparker_> let's get things working, then leave it alone
[08:35:42] <toddmparker_> too much churn
[08:36:08] <Wilto> I’m gonna put s’more semicolons in that makefile. Semicolons are always good.
[08:50:53] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:51:12] <gseguin> what did I miss?
[08:51:17] <gseguin> is 2.0 out?
[08:51:52] <gseguin> johnbender: I don't have access to that machine
[08:52:31] <gseguin> did I manage to break something just with the force ?
[08:57:20] <johnbender> gseguin: nope, toddmparker_ thought you worked some magic last night with the redirect but I think it's being cached because it was a permanent redirect (301)
[08:58:03] <gseguin> Yeah I almost told him to clear his cache
[08:58:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: two quick questions
[08:58:19] <johnbender> 1.0-stable has the version.txt set to 1.0.1pre
[08:58:36] <johnbender> just double checking that should be changed to 1.0.1?
[08:58:40] <johnbender> or are we doing a quick pre release
[08:58:44] <gseguin> we'll set it to 1.0.1 right before tagging it
[08:58:49] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[08:58:56] <johnbender> yah I figured but I wanted to double check
[08:59:09] <toddmparker_> yea?
[08:59:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: also, we use the minified version of jqm for the demo site but not  the minified version of jquery
[08:59:42] <toddmparker_> was going to ask about the version.txt
[09:00:02] <toddmparker_> almost changed it yesterday but wasn't sure if i need to wait until the very end
[09:00:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin is right, but I wasn't sure if you wanted to do a quick pre release or something
[09:00:06] <toddmparker_> anyway, yes change it
[09:00:09] <johnbender> kk
[09:00:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: second question?
[09:00:27] <toddmparker_> pre release?
[09:00:44] <toddmparker_> is that the 2nd Q
[09:01:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: also, we use the minified version of jqm for the demo site but not  the minified version of jquery
[09:01:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[09:01:59] <johnbender> I figure it should probably be the reverse or both minified/unminified
[09:02:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the reason I'm asking these is I'm doing a dry run of the deploy on my machine to find anything odd
[09:02:33] <gseguin> are we all set for release?
[09:02:51] <gseguin> I can take care of the version.txt and the tagging if you'd like
[09:03:10] <johnbender> gseguin: nah I got it
[09:03:17] <johnbender> I'm going to do it when I get into the office
[09:03:33] <gseguin> 'k
[09:03:49] <Wilto> Oh, right. I’ve been so wrapped up in making our form widgets more adorable that I forgot 1.0.1 was happening today.
[09:04:02] <Wilto> Anything still outstanding that I can jump in on?
[09:04:20] <johnbender> Wilto: nope we're all set to deploy
[09:04:23] <johnbender> gseguin: ah!
[09:04:28] <johnbender> gseguin: also, while you're here
[09:04:41] <gseguin> yes sir?
[09:04:42] <Wilto> johnbender: In that case: animated gifs locked and loaded, sir.
[09:04:51] <toddmparker_> dry run is fine with me
[09:05:11] <toddmparker_> when eddie did it, it was confusing because he tagged as RC3 of whatever
[09:05:27] <toddmparker_> is we can do this quietly so we can test, that would make me happy
[09:05:35] <toddmparker_> but we're ready
[09:05:51] <gseguin> johnbender: what's up?
[09:06:04] <toddmparker_> once it's up and it looks good, i'll release the blog post (and the hounds!) and update the rest of the site
[09:06:06] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm going to require that anyone altering the makefile from now on has access to the server to deal with builds
[09:06:27] <gseguin> yeah I saw that
[09:06:48] <gseguin> should I not touch the makefile anymore or get access to the server?
[09:06:52] <johnbender> between that an some basic monitoring hopefully we'll minimize the broken build issue
[09:06:56] <johnbender> gseguin: up to you
[09:07:07] <johnbender> but if it breaks and I'm not around you're "on call"
[09:07:18] <johnbender> pager duty as it were
[09:07:29] <toddmparker_> i'll send you a pager
[09:07:30] <gseguin> I'd rather have access since some of the AMD things are in the build
[09:07:32] <toddmparker_> and a bag phone
[09:07:37] <johnbender> gseguin: great
[09:07:43] <johnbender> always better to have two people
[09:08:04] <johnbender> ok I'm heading in to "the office"
[09:08:04] <toddmparker_> coming your way - http://i100.photobucket.com/albums/m23/unrulybrown/motorola_bag_phone-lg.jpg
[09:08:47] <gseguin> toddmparker_: that's awesome, I'll look very trendy carrying that around
[09:12:04] <toddmparker_> yeah, it's hawt
[09:38:05] <toddmparker_> so /tst is still re-directing for some people
[09:38:41] <gseguin> they need to clear their browser cache
[09:39:07] <gseguin> btw the 2nd hit in google is cdn/latest
[09:39:54] <gseguin> which is still out of date
[09:42:14] <toddmparker_> yeah. is that cdn version updatable? confusion in the bug tracker about these links.
[09:43:00] <gseguin> we need bender
[09:43:10] <gseguin> yeah it's updatable
[09:43:34] <gseguin> but we don't want to do it on post_receive
[09:43:48] <gseguin> but rather on a cron job
[10:01:51] <toddmparker_> ok
[10:34:26] <gseguin> toddmparker_: meeting today?
[10:41:53] <toddmparker_> yep
[10:51:42] <Wilto> Oh, right, ten minutes. Im’ma be eating a burrito during it.
[10:52:13] <toddmparker_> gseguin: you going to post a link in a bit?
[10:53:53] <gseguin> yup
[10:56:38] <gseguin> https://talkgadget.google.com/hangouts/extras/talk.google.com/jquerymobile-meeting
[10:57:45] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I can't post the link to #jquery-meeting
[10:58:26] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, still locked.
[10:58:33] <toddmparker_> ah
[10:58:36] <toddmparker_> hold on
[11:00:17] <toddmparker_> fixed?
[11:00:25] <gseguin> nope
[11:00:41] <Wilto> Still nada.
[11:01:23] <gseguin> there we go, thanks toddparker
[11:03:33] <toddmparker_> johnbender and kinblas - you around for the meeting?
[11:05:05] <gseguin> johnbender: meeting time
[11:05:10] <gseguin> https://talkgadget.google.com/hangouts/extras/talk.google.com/jquerymobile-meeting
[11:05:16] <johnbender> gseguin: thanks
[11:05:34] <Wilto> You’re ruining our agile standup scrum, johnbender.
[11:05:45] <Wilto> (I don’t know what any of those things mean.)
[11:07:36] <johnbender> I'm having some issues
[11:07:43] <johnbender> switching to my mac
[11:08:16] <Wilto> That’s what I like to hear.
[11:21:52] <gseguin> I got disconnected
[11:30:51] <johnbender> toddparker: afk for just a sec
[11:32:34] <gseguin> kinblas: can you take a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3475
[11:32:34] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by jasondscott (2d, 21h ago): Issue #1524 - Taphold event fired while scrolling on Blackberry Playbook
[11:32:49] <gseguin> I was going to pull it but I would like your blessing
[11:33:17] <kinblas> gseguin: by all means ... I haven't been in the office since last week (was in seattle) so I don't have a playbook at the moment
[11:33:56] <gseguin> oh I trust that it works on the playbook since it's JasonDScott who did the fix ;)
[11:34:18] <johnbender> JasonDScott: respect
[11:36:03] <JasonDScott> It is working on the playbook :)
[11:36:32] <JasonDScott> I tested playbook 2.0 and ipad 5.0.1
[11:36:41] <gseguin> cool
[11:42:19] * johnbender raises the roof for JasonDScott

[11:42:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3475 from jasondscott/issue_1524 - Ghislain Seguin
[11:42:46] <johnbender> I own a shirt that says "Raising the roof for God, 'cause he's really tall"
[11:43:04] <johnbender> it's a fun spirited jibe at my religion
[12:05:29] <toddparker> johnbender: i'll be in a meeting for the next hour, then can dig into the 1.0.1 launch
[12:06:11] <johnbender> toddparker: kk
[12:06:25] <johnbender> just that one change and we should be good to go
[12:20:46] <Wilto> So, I have an inside person at Google. A mole, if you will.
[12:21:00] <Wilto> It seems our previous Android guy is no longer there, which explains the unanswered emails.
[12:21:04] <Wilto> I’m workin’ on something.
[12:32:42] <kinblas> WIlto: so does your "inside person" dig working at Google? Pa-dum-pum-hey-oh
[12:42:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/sVPgEw

[12:42:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] use jquery min for deploy build - John Bender
[12:44:11] <johnbender> toddparker: when we release 1.1 will we be recommending 1.7.1 ?
[12:55:07] <toddparker> yes 1.1 and 1.7.1 are like peanut butter and chocolate
[13:00:11] <johnbender> toddparker: alright I'm going to tag and bag this thing
[13:01:56] <gseguin> peanut butter and chocolate ? ewww
[13:09:58] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 3 new commits to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/SrubVA

[13:10:18] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker: alright here we go, if there's an issue I'll let you guys know here
[13:10:30] <johnbender> gotta pee first
[13:10:32] <johnbender> :P
[13:10:37] <gseguin> TMI
[13:10:56] <gseguin> :)
[13:14:13] <johnbender> and the monkey pushes the button
[13:15:16] <gseguin> ?shipit
[13:15:24] <johnbender> one sec
[13:15:25] <johnbender> lol
[13:15:27] <gseguin> damm it bot-t
[13:15:46] <johnbender> I think the reason why the closure compiler version is wrong is that someone did a find replace on 2011
[13:16:24] <johnbender> toddparker: `git checkout 1.0-stable; git show 85a0a00a3ff707896496aafad214c75c3ad1ff84`
[13:16:53] <johnbender> PROOF!
[13:16:56] <johnbender> lol
[13:16:59] <gseguin> nice!
[13:17:12] <gseguin> very nice!
[13:17:35] <johnbender> lol
[13:18:55] <gseguin> why is that commit not on master?
[13:19:04] <johnbender> gseguin: not sure
[13:19:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/SpIN2A
[13:19:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] undo the copyright swap - John Bender
[13:29:04] <johnbender> deploy complete
[13:29:50] <johnbender> toddparker: 1.0.1 is up
[13:31:02] <johnbender> toddparker: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0.1/
[13:31:15] <johnbender> the only hitch was that my emacs was leaving temp files around which caused issues with scp
[13:31:17] <Wilto> Oh damn, he’s on a call.
[13:31:19] <johnbender> I'm going to correct that
[13:31:22] <johnbender> Wilto: that's fine
[13:31:44] <Wilto> Nothin’ pressing going on? Just waiting on him to press the announcement buttons?
[13:32:03] <johnbender> Wilto: yah and he wants to double check his links to the cdn
[13:32:10] <Wilto> Cool, cool.
[13:32:28] <kinblas> Wilto: toddmparker: gseguin: any of you guys update your iPad 1st Gen to 5.0.1?
[13:32:47] <kinblas> just curious about your experience ... I'm about to upgrade from 4.3.5
[13:32:51] <johnbender> pfft
[13:32:53] <johnbender> ipads
[13:32:57] <gseguin> a coworker of mine did
[13:32:57] <johnbender> more like iFAD
[13:33:04] <johnbender> amiright?
[13:33:20] <kinblas> lol
[13:33:36] <kinblas> gseguin: just curious in terms of perf and battery life
[13:33:37] <Wilto> nevr heard of them are they new
[13:33:50] <Wilto> We might, kinblas. One sec.
[13:34:09] <Wilto> Oh, in general? I’ve never really had any trouble with an iOS upgrade, truth be told.
[13:34:46] <kinblas> Wilto: so you' re running 5.0.x?
[13:35:09] <gseguin> kinblas: no major problem reported
[13:35:35] <Wilto> Lemme see.
[13:35:50] <kinblas> gseguin: ok ... I remember when I went from 3.x to 4.x on ipad there was a period of time when things sucked ... till apple worked out the kinks
[13:36:19] <Wilto> Yeah, 5.0.1.
[13:36:21] <kinblas> so now I skip the first .0 releases
[13:37:10] <gseguin> yeah no she said that she certainly was not happy with the beta
[13:37:20] <gseguin> but she likes 5.0.1
[13:37:43] <kinblas> gseguin: ok great! I'll give it a whirl .. after I backup and sync :-)
[13:48:31] <toddmparker_> hi johnbender
[13:48:36] <toddmparker_> i'm off the call
[13:48:41] <johnbender> toddparker: it's up
[13:48:54] <johnbender> no hangups save for my stupid editor configuration causing a stall after scp
[13:48:57] <johnbender> otherwise, no hitches
[13:49:19] <johnbender> toddparker: might want to give it a whirl to make sure all is well
[13:49:25] <toddmparker_> yeah, our ipad upgrade went swimmingly kinblas
[13:49:35] <johnbender> eg, double check that the versions are right
[13:49:37] <toddmparker_> ok, i'll check all the CDN links
[13:49:48] <kinblas> toddmparker_: not so much the upgrade but the perf/battery-life
[13:50:26] <toddmparker_> good - this works and it uses the CDN links: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0.1/docs/pages/multipage-template.html
[13:50:30] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it has to be useable :-) My experience is that things get slower and slower with each upgrade and then I'm forced to upgrade hardware :-)
[13:50:56] <johnbender> toddparker: cool, I'm going to set up some basic monitoring on the server for our builds
[13:51:11] <toddmparker_> checking the zip now...
[13:51:21] <toddmparker_> all the CSS and JS CDN links are a GO
[13:51:42] <Wilto> Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed.
[13:52:31] <gseguin> toddmparker_: http://vimeo.com/35716341
[13:58:27] <toddmparker_> thanks gseguin
[13:58:36] <toddmparker_> so johnbender - the local zip looks great
[13:58:48] <toddmparker_> one Q tho - there is an images folder in the root
[13:59:30] <toddmparker_> oh, i guess it makes sense relative to the css
[13:59:37] <toddmparker_> i was just thrown off at first
[13:59:45] <toddmparker_> so that looks perfect
[14:00:27] <toddmparker_> Funny - when you open the docs, we have that big yellow banner at the bottom that says...
[14:00:31] <toddmparker_> "The AJAX-based navigation used throughout the jQuery Mobile docs may need to be viewed on a web server to work in certain browsers. If you see an error message when you click a link, try a different browser or view help."
[14:00:43] <toddmparker_> and the view help link went to a blank wiki page
[14:00:44] <toddmparker_> oops
[14:01:07] <toddmparker_> I just pasted the Apache stuff from the readme here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Downloadable-Docs-Help
[14:01:49] <johnbender> toddparker: sorry so you downloaded the packaged docs?
[14:01:54] <toddmparker_> gseguin: are you editing the blog now?
[14:01:59] <toddmparker_> yep
[14:02:00] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm not sure those got updated with the deploy
[14:02:04] <toddmparker_> everything works like a charm
[14:02:16] <johnbender> ahh
[14:02:18] <johnbender> nevermind it does
[14:02:23] <johnbender> toddparker: so we're good to go?
[14:02:25] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I'm not
[14:02:27] <toddmparker_> think so
[14:02:38] <toddmparker_> the zip demos have the 1.0.1 banner, new copyright, etc.
[14:02:51] <toddmparker_> i tested everything and it looks good
[14:03:13] <toddmparker_> i just need to update the homepage then i can publish the blog
[14:05:26] <toddmparker_> publishing....
[14:05:28] <gseguin> toddmparker_: the native ICS looks a little better but it's still not good: http://vimeo.com/35716602
[14:05:31] <toddmparker_> speak now
[14:05:54] <gseguin> Yeeeaaaaahhh, congrats team!
[14:06:35] <johnbender> gseguin: curl -s "http://github.com/api/v2/json/commits/list/jquery/jquery-mobile/master" | sed 's/,"id":"/\n/g' | sed 's/",.*//' | head -n2 | tail -1
[14:06:38] <johnbender> lawl
[14:07:38] <gseguin> johnbender: what's that commit?
[14:07:38] <Wilto> Why are you speaking in tongues, johnbender.
[14:08:18] <johnbender> gseguin: that's just to get the first commit from the github api
[14:08:24] <johnbender> I want to check against that after a build
[14:08:37] <johnbender> with the obvious understanding it may throw false positivies
[14:08:40] <johnbender> *positives
[14:18:45] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I didn't see a tweet
[14:20:13] <toddmparker_> working on it!
[14:20:34] <toddmparker_> i was uploading to the MSFT CDN
[14:20:42] <gseguin> oh ok
[14:20:48] <toddmparker_> it takes them a while to get it up
[14:20:58] <toddmparker_> so the link is always broken for a bit
[14:22:35] <Wilto> Something something IE joke.
[14:24:08] <toddmparker_> ok, tweeted
[14:29:13] <jzaefferer> hey Wilto! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFKylgGk73I
[14:29:33] <toddmparker_> GO TEAM GO
[14:29:50] <Wilto> What is this!
[14:29:50] <toddmparker_> thanks everyone. we'r a small team, but we're a finely oiled machine
[14:30:20] <Wilto> jzaefferer: CD-i?
[14:30:22] <jzaefferer> 22 A-grade browsers
[14:30:59] <jzaefferer> dunno what to say about that
[14:34:18] <Wilto> Right? We don’t play.
[14:35:59] <toddmparker_> 22 a grade platforms :)
[14:36:14] <jzaefferer> platforms, right
[14:36:20] <jzaefferer> tis crazy!
[14:36:22] <toddmparker_> one one those bullets is iOS 3-5 on iphones and iPads
[14:36:37] <Wilto> I’m not good at math, but that’s about two thousand six hundred and eight browsers in total.
[14:36:38] <toddmparker_> yeah, it's very compatible for sure
[14:36:56] <toddmparker_> was saying i wanted to calculate the # of devices/users for each
[14:37:02] <toddmparker_> and sum up our reach
[14:37:10] <toddmparker_> ex. iOS is like 240 million
[14:37:18] <toddmparker_> Opera mini is 100m
[14:37:22] <toddmparker_> etc
[14:38:09] <Wilto> Skyfire is at _least_ six people.
[14:41:02] <jzaefferer> I used Skyfire for a while
[14:41:13] <jzaefferer> not on 4.x anymore, so down to five?
[14:41:22] <johnbender> jzaefferer !== normal user
[14:41:36] <jzaefferer> people === normal user?
[14:41:49] <johnbender> gerbels === normal user
[14:41:58] <johnbender> gerbils
[14:42:12] <toddmparker_> we love everyone, even if they pick odd browsers
[14:42:24] <Wilto> We’re the hippy framework.
[14:42:27] <toddmparker_> skyfire just got a fresh round of funding a few days ago
[14:42:32] <toddmparker_> seemed popular on android
[14:42:33] <johnbender> how is miketaylor not online right now :(
[14:42:40] <toddmparker_> it's webkit so it's easy to support
[14:42:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: :( :(
[14:42:49] <jzaefferer> unlike the stock Android browser, you can actually get updates for Skyfire
[14:42:50] <johnbender> how can you say that
[14:42:53] <toddmparker_> i know, right
[14:42:57] <johnbender> lol
[14:43:17] <toddmparker_> gseguin: those videos of ICS make me want to weep
[14:43:20] <jzaefferer> toddmparker_: its like you want everything to be webkit
[14:43:35] <toddmparker_> (not for me, for people bamboozled into buying phones running that steaming pile)
[14:43:38] <jzaefferer> worst thing about Android 3/4: no history.pushState
[14:43:40] <toddmparker_> heh
[14:43:56] <toddmparker_> ...or animations
[14:44:01] <Wilto> So many worst things, jzaefferer. So many.
[14:44:07] <johnbender> jzaefferer: so much about webkit implementations is different between browsers
[14:44:08] <toddmparker_> or smooth scrolling
[14:44:18] <Wilto> Altering focus via CSS properties.
[14:44:26] <johnbender> ugh, bad form
[14:44:28] <Wilto> I still get a nosebleed just thinking about that.
[14:44:34] <jzaefferer> animations and scrolling seem fine to me
[14:44:35] <toddmparker_> hee
[14:44:40] <Wilto> …Oh?
[14:44:43] <jzaefferer> what videos were you looking at?
[14:44:51] <toddmparker_> when was the last time you used an iOS device jzaefferer
[14:45:04] <toddmparker_> think you're forgetting animations can have more than 3 frames
[14:45:12] <jzaefferer> I still got my 3GS around, but don't really use that
[14:45:15] <Wilto> HUGE SLAM ON ANDROID, OUT OF NOWHERE
[14:45:29] <jzaefferer> also got the iOS simulator open way too much...
[14:45:47] <toddmparker_> jzaefferer: http://vimeo.com/35716602
[14:45:49] <Wilto> I wish we knew what the hell the x-factor is, from ICS device to ICS device.
[14:46:03] <jzaefferer> well, guess animations in the browser are very different from system-level animations
[14:46:06] <toddmparker_> gseguin shot that and the video below (on vimeo) today
[14:46:06] <jzaefferer> the latter are fine
[14:46:14] <toddmparker_> sure
[14:46:16] <Wilto> Reports everywhere from “unusably bad” to “great.”
[14:46:25] <toddmparker_> but the browser literally cannot run any animations
[14:46:37] <jzaefferer> uhm
[14:46:46] <jzaefferer> the video framerate isn't exactly great to start with
[14:46:48] <toddmparker_> an old iPhone 3G would smoke a Nexus S on transitions
[14:47:01] <toddmparker_> it's the 3 seconds of blank screen
[14:47:02] <jzaefferer> I mean, his finger also has a pretty low fps
[14:47:07] <toddmparker_> heh
[14:47:21] <toddmparker_> what device do you have jzaefferer
[14:47:28] <jzaefferer> Nexus S
[14:47:51] <jzaefferer> but again, just talking about the OS level animations, no idea about the browser
[14:48:05] <Wilto> Tell you what, jzaefferer:
[14:48:08] <jzaefferer> for most sites though, the ICS browser is a lot faster then the various 2.3 stuff I tried
[14:48:21] <Wilto> We’ll trade you five BlackBerry devices for your Nexus.
[14:48:31] <Wilto> And half a Zune.
[14:48:47] <jzaefferer> Any real rarities in your collection?
[14:48:52] <jzaefferer> I like my Nexus :-)
[14:49:14] <toddmparker_> I have a Nexus S too
[14:49:21] <Wilto> Naaah. I wish the hell we had a Newton.
[14:49:23] <toddmparker_> it's running 2.3 still, right?
[14:49:38] <jzaefferer> I got the ICS update a few weeks ago
[14:49:42] <Wilto> Yeah. That’s the one with the TV-lookin’ effect when you shut it off?
[14:49:48] <jzaefferer> suddenly, out of nowhere
[14:49:51] <toddmparker_> yeah? and it's not half bricked?
[14:49:52] <jzaefferer> yep
[14:49:56] <toddmparker_> wowie
[14:50:03] <toddmparker_> they pulled it and said "nevermind"
[14:50:06] <jzaefferer> working much better then before
[14:50:10] <toddmparker_> guessing because perf was so bad
[14:50:50] <jzaefferer> I was getting close to buying one of those Galaxy 2 samsung whatevers, but after the update, its working pretty well
[14:51:22] <jzaefferer> well, I should get some sleep before I try and teach all kinds of JS related topics to 8 people tomorrow...
[14:51:25] <Wilto> This is why I use an Handspring Visor and a bag phone.
[14:51:28] <jzaefferer> and Saturday :/
[14:51:29] <Wilto> Much less complicated.
[14:51:38] <jzaefferer> I don't know what that is
[14:51:46] <toddmparker_> busy jzaefferer
[14:51:59] <toddmparker_> bag phone?
[14:52:08] <Wilto> jzaefferer: http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2002/04/04/comparison_of_six_pdas/handspring.jpg
[14:52:08] <jzaefferer> but I'm sure Christpher Walken wouldn't approve
[14:52:10] <Wilto> Swag.
[14:52:20] <jzaefferer> uhu
[14:52:32] <jzaefferer> why are those labels in german?
[14:52:50] <Wilto> As you can see from the “Kalendar,” they didn’t yet have the technology to implement the letter C across multiple labels.
[14:52:59] <Wilto> Dark times.
[14:53:00] <jzaefferer> seriously, its in german
[14:53:04] <jzaefferer> Merkzettel!
[14:53:07] <jzaefferer> Rechner!
[14:53:12] <jzaefferer> Aufgaben!
[14:53:13] <Wilto> oh god stop yelling at me
[14:53:24] <jzaefferer> Yes sir!
[14:53:26] <jzaefferer> good night
[14:53:39] <Wilto> Hah—later on, man!

[15:14:01] <gseguin> later
[15:18:25] <gseguin> johnbender: who do I send my keys to?
[15:18:41] <johnbender> gseguin: just the public key and you can send it to e
[15:18:45] <johnbender> *me
[15:18:55] <gseguin> I have 2 of them
[15:19:08] <johnbender> gseguin: two machines?
[15:19:12] <gseguin> one for my laptop (Jive owned) and one for my home workstation
[15:19:13] <gseguin> yes
[15:19:31] <johnbender> danheberden: ^
[15:19:39] <johnbender> not sure if you guys have a one key policy or anything
[15:19:46] <johnbender> minimize theft/loss issues etc
[15:19:59] <danheberden> johnbender i have both, is this still about keys on jqm?
[15:20:17] <johnbender> yessir
[15:20:28] <johnbender> I can put them up just want to make sure that's fine
[15:20:44] <danheberden> totes
[15:21:03] <johnbender> gseguin: send them to me then
[15:21:16] <gseguin> awright
[15:29:27] <johnbender> gseguin: give it a try
[15:29:36] <gseguin> what?
[15:29:40] <johnbender> gseguin: ssh
[15:29:41] <gseguin> ssh jquerymobile.com ?
[15:29:45] <johnbender> jqadmin@jquerymobile.com
[15:29:54] <johnbender> -i ~/.ssh/yourkey
[15:30:50] <gseguin> yup
[15:30:52] <gseguin> working
[15:35:39] <gseguin> johnbender: I'll clean up the branches dir
[15:35:59] <gseguin> is that cool?
[15:36:27] <johnbender> gseguin: for the branches that don't exist anymore?
[15:36:33] <gseguin> indeed
[15:36:41] * johnbender needs an rsynch for life
[15:36:46] <johnbender> *rsync
[15:37:28] <gseguin> so?
[15:39:01] <johnbender> gseguin: oh yah go for it
[15:39:19] <johnbender> gseguin: sorry I was just thinking how it would be nice if we could just rsync arbitrary stuff
[15:39:37] <gseguin> Permission denied, WAT?
[15:39:43] <johnbender> gseguin: apache
[15:39:58] <johnbender> gseguin: you can su apache methinks
[15:40:06] <gseguin> or just sudo the rm
[15:40:13] <danheberden> sudo ^
[15:40:21] <johnbender> gseguin: ah sorry I was thinking you were moving things
[15:40:22] <johnbender> yes
[15:40:24] <johnbender> just remove them
[15:40:39] <johnbender> gseguin: we need to keep things as apache though when they're in that section of the file system is why
[15:40:49] <gseguin> ok
[15:40:55] <gseguin> ?BOOM
[15:40:55] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[15:41:25] <gseguin> ah crap, the index.html is static
[15:41:36] <johnbender> gseguin: do you have access to the jqm repo? iirc you do
[15:42:26] <gseguin> let me see
[15:43:53] <gseguin> wait, what's the github url for the jqm web repo ?
[15:44:01] <johnbender> gseguin: jquery/jquerymobile.com
[15:44:47] <gseguin> yeah I have access to it
[15:46:52] <gseguin> looks like running curl -s "http://jquerymobile.com/branches-preview.php ... might do the trick of regenerating the index.html
[15:47:55] <johnbender> gseguin: thats in a cron
[15:48:01] <johnbender> that same curl
[15:48:09] <gseguin> yeah that's where I got it from
[15:48:09] <johnbender> `crontab -l`
[15:48:14] <johnbender> cool
[15:48:37] <gseguin> I was just double checking with you that I could run it now
[15:49:41] <johnbender> gseguin: sure, as long as you deal with the fallout :P
[15:49:45] <johnbender> I'm sure it's fine
[15:50:12] <gseguin> holly shit it's a long call
[15:51:32] <gseguin> oh I know why it's not working
[15:51:40] <gseguin> it's using a submodule
[15:51:50] <gseguin> it needs to be updated
[15:52:01] <gseguin> I have to leave in 10min
[15:52:07] <gseguin> not sure I want to get into that
[15:53:14] <johnbender> gseguin: pretty sure you don't
[15:53:19] <johnbender> gseguin: can you just update the index?
[15:53:26] <gseguin> manually?
[15:53:37] <johnbender> gseguin: yah how many branches are there?
[15:53:43] <gseguin> yuck
[15:54:41] <johnbender> gseguin: you're over it
[15:56:20] <gseguin> I almost started doing so
[15:56:44] <gseguin> and realized that b$%^ of php script repulled every dir I had removed
[15:56:59] <gseguin> that's because of the submodule
[17:07:07] <danheberden> johnbender - you mind if i add your ssh key to the infra repo's wiki?
[17:10:26] <danheberden> oh, heh, he left
[17:10:35] <danheberden> ?tell johnbender - you mind if i add your ssh key to the infra repo's wiki?
[17:10:36] <bot-t> danheberden, Okay.
[18:30:35] <imjoshdean> huzzah, I am the greatest \o/
[18:45:40] <eighteyes> anyone available for a quick theme question?
