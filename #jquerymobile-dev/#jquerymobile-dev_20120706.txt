[00:20:18] <agcolom> gseguin: No worries, all sorted now :-) it was just a tiny typo I couldn't cherry pick (in a unit test) but turned out it was not to be cherry-picked because the original was not in 1.1-stable. So we're all good ;-)

[04:09:43] <jayant> hello
[07:58:09] <uGoMobi> hello jayant
[07:58:29] <uGoMobi> jayant:  did you want to ask something?
[08:26:01] <jayant> uGoMobi: yes but i am not sure if its appropriate for this room or not, i am starting of with jqm i just needed some advice on from where to begin at, i can understand the various functions given under demos section on the jqm website. Not sure where should i go from here
[08:29:14] <uGoMobi> jayant: have you read this page http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/getting-started.html ?
[08:29:53] <uGoMobi> that tells everything that is needed to get started
[08:30:19] <uGoMobi> from there on you can look at what kind of components / features you want to add
[08:31:46] <uGoMobi> if you have something in mind that you want to create, but you don't know how to achieve it, the forum is a great place to ask for help
[08:32:02] <uGoMobi> https://forum.jquery.com/jquery-mobile
[08:33:12] <uGoMobi> do you already know what kind of site / web app you want to create or just want to see what you can do with jQuery Mobile?
[10:01:14] <ryanneufeld> Hola
[10:01:28] <ryanneufeld> Gotta question for you guys if you're around
[10:01:40] <ryanneufeld> I'm wondering if you know how reliable document.referrer is
[10:02:02] <ryanneufeld> I found an article on w3schools, but.. it's on w3schools so I don't entirely trust it.
[11:17:04] <Wilto> who said w3schools huh what
[11:33:09] <ryanneufeld> I did
[11:33:19] <ryanneufeld> *ducks*
[11:33:32] <ryanneufeld> but it was in a negative context, so it's okay.... right?
[12:03:16] <agcolom> toddmparker_?
[12:03:56] <toddmparker_> hi all
[12:04:03] <toddmparker_> catching up
[12:04:14] <agcolom> Hi !!!
[12:04:35] <agcolom> How are you?
[12:04:37] <toddmparker_> agcolom: that copyright PR is fine to land if you haven't
[12:04:43] <toddmparker_> good, how are you?
[12:04:50] <agcolom> gseguin did.
[12:05:03] <agcolom> I'm good, still recovering from bad back :-(
[12:05:46] <agcolom> (hurt it over 10 days ago, but was given crazy meds!)
[12:06:14] <agcolom> side effect: hallucinations!
[12:06:30] <agcolom> But it's getting better ;-)
[12:06:54] <agcolom> will we need to cherry-pick the copyright into 1.1-stable?
[12:12:37] <agcolom> (to know how to do the docs ones...)
[12:15:59] <agcolom> Do I get the green light for making the change on Wordpress as well? (If i can find where it is!)
[12:29:51] <agcolom> Well, I can't find where is the footer info in wordpress... and I can't find the theme editor...
[12:31:28] <agcolom> ok, I've found it but I do not have sufficient permissions to access this page...
[12:32:36] <toddmparker_> yikes agcolom - hope you feel better
[12:32:52] <toddmparker_> i can make that change if you can't in WP
[12:32:59] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: Are you around?
[12:33:05] <agcolom> ok, that'd be great!
[12:33:08] <toddmparker_> wanted to check in on popup stuffs
[12:33:14] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[12:33:19] <toddmparker_> this just came in: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4650
[12:33:20] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #4650 on jquery-mobile (EarMaster; 4h, 29m ago): Option to center Popups
[12:33:33] <toddmparker_> I agree and would like to add this
[12:34:11] <agcolom> I like that. I can also see how to extend this to the popup with the arrow
[12:34:44] <agcolom> it would be nice to have an easy way to attach a popup to an element on the page
[12:35:27] <agcolom> btw, I tried to replicate your popup screenshots where the popup is bigger than the viewport!
[12:36:13] <agcolom> Which ios was it? (I could not reproduce on my iPod Touch 5.1)
[12:36:40] <agcolom> and _|Nix|_ I believe also could dot reproduce with 5.1.1
[12:36:55] <agcolom> So I am thinking it may have been an older iOS?
[12:43:20] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ toddmparker_ I think i may just have found a bug with the popups that is related to the version of iOS.
[12:43:42] <agcolom> (experiencing it on the simulator)
[12:44:05] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[12:44:12] <agcolom> Go to the popup docs page, with HW set to 4.3
[12:44:44] <agcolom> go down the page and pick a popup (open popup woth close button right)
[12:44:47] <agcolom> all ok
[12:45:14] <agcolom> now change HW to iPhone 4.0.2
[12:45:20] <agcolom> do the same thing
[12:45:28] <agcolom> 1st click nothing happens
[12:45:46] <agcolom> 2nd click, the popup is opened at the top of the page
[12:46:29] <agcolom> if you close it and scroll down again, and open another popup, the popup is always opened at the top
[12:47:02] <agcolom> sorry, when you click, the page scrolls up and the popup is at teh top of the page.
[12:47:22] <agcolom> when you dismiss the popup the page scrolls back down where you were
[12:47:44] <agcolom> Have got to go pick up my daughter... will be back in 15mins
[12:47:54] <agcolom> Will check with 4.1 and 4.2
[12:48:19] <agcolom> Are you getting the samebehavior?
[13:01:35] <toddmparker_> I think we only have 4.3 devices
[13:01:48] <toddmparker_> those are oddball versions
[13:02:11] <toddmparker_> agcolom: the popup with arrow does add quite a bit of complexity
[13:02:21] <toddmparker_> i think we'd need to use UI's position popup to do it efficiently
[13:02:46] <toddmparker_> so _|Nix|_ - i think you already had some centering logic internally, right?
[13:03:18] <toddmparker_> johnbender, gseguin, uGoMobi, agcolom, _|Nix|_, jasondscott - did you all have a call yesterday?
[13:06:42] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker_ : yes
[13:11:10] <agcolom> I'm back and yes we did meet yesterday on #jquery-meeting
[13:11:57] <agcolom> toddmparker_ ok, so for those old versions nothing to worry about but good to know in case this comes up on GitHub.
[13:12:04] <agcolom> ?
[13:14:23] <agcolom> All ok with 4.2 which is good as this is the last possible upgrade with some devices
[13:15:51] <jayant> uGoMobi: sorry i fell asleep on the desk earlier, thanks for the advice
[13:16:21] <uGoMobi> jayant: haha... you are welcome
[13:18:36] <jayant> uGoMobi: i have already gone through it though :), is there anything else i should know about JQM?
[13:20:02] <uGoMobi> jayant: what are you plans? just want to become familiar with JQM or have a specific project?
[13:20:09] <uGoMobi> your*
[13:21:37] <agcolom> jayant, you can have a look at the JQM resources page... lots of useful articles, presentation and tutorials
[13:22:02] <agcolom> they are in reverse chronological order, so the most recent are 1st.
[13:22:05] <jayant> uGomobi: my plans are to combine PG and JQM to create some apps and i have eclipse environment setup on a mac, and i am focusing on utility apps for now
[13:22:27] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/resources/
[13:22:36] <jayant> agcolom: thanks i will give them a read :)
[13:23:30] <uGoMobi> jayant: I guess you have found the page about PG in the docs?
[13:23:47] <jayant> at the front of my mind i want to use phongap+jqm+face api to create a simple face recognition unlocking system
[13:24:22] <jayant> uGoMobi: i actually came in a reverse order :P from phonegap to jqm
[13:24:30] <uGoMobi> face recognition doensn't simple to me ;)
[13:25:01] <uGoMobi> doesn't sound*
[13:25:11] <uGoMobi> pfff... typos :(
[13:25:16] <jayant> http://developers.face.com/ i was planning to use this
[13:25:36] <uGoMobi> cool
[13:25:51] <jayant> i know nothing ever is when you are a noob :)
[13:25:59] <uGoMobi> anyway... like agcolom said you can have a look at the resources
[13:26:03] <jayant> so i just buckle up and learn and create
[13:26:22] <uGoMobi> there is a themeroller to create custom styling
[13:26:49] <uGoMobi> we just launched alpha version of download builder in case you don't need all the framework has to offer
[13:26:51] <jayant> yes i have tested that
[13:27:09] <uGoMobi> besides that ... search the forum for PG
[13:27:15] <jayant> can i have the link to download builder?
[13:27:44] <uGoMobi>  and maybe good idea to search for phonegap on the issue tracker at the JQM repo on Github
[13:28:16] <jayant> ok i will do that
[13:28:18] <uGoMobi> just so you know about known issues
[13:28:30] <uGoMobi> that's about it I think
[13:28:45] <uGoMobi> the basics are really simple
[13:29:30] <uGoMobi> with the basics I am mean ... what you need to know to get started
[13:29:55] <uGoMobi> just play with it :D
[13:30:21] <agcolom> toddmparker_ we should add a paragraph about JQM on http://jquery.org/ (with logo ;-) )
[13:32:14] <jayant> thank you guys :)
[13:32:58] <uGoMobi> you are welcome jayant ... good luck!
[13:33:51] <jayant> thank you and i just finished my college education :D just got my result :D looks like a good start
[13:35:14] <jayant> and good luck to you guys too :)
[13:35:15] <uGoMobi> congrats!
[13:35:22] <uGoMobi> thanks :)
[14:18:24] <agcolom> toddmparker_ the new copyright, is it for 1.2 or will it need to be cherry-picked? cc: gseguin
[14:19:01] <toddmparker_> i think we can do 1.2
[14:19:13] <toddmparker_> i'd rather not touch the RC code
[14:20:28] <toddmparker_> so i haven't seen anything major come in after the 1.1.1 RC - have you all?
[14:20:40] <toddmparker_> I think we could probably just push that next week
[14:20:42] <uGoMobi> no
[14:21:00] <toddmparker_> for 1.2, i would like to talk about that center positioning option
[14:21:08] <toddmparker_> seems like an important thing to get in there
[14:21:33] <toddmparker_> so it opens either based on where you tap (default) or centered in the window
[14:21:37] <uGoMobi> any idications how many people tried 1.1.1.RC1? number of zip downloads or CDN traffic?
[14:21:44] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: sorry if I missed you response to that
[14:21:56] <toddmparker_> data is always hard to come by
[14:22:50] <uGoMobi> $('.selector').popup('open', x, y);
[14:22:50] <uGoMobi> 				
[14:22:50] <uGoMobi> If x or y is missing, the middle of the window will be used.
[14:23:01] <uGoMobi> looks like the option is already there
[14:23:15] <uGoMobi> but cant be set with data-attr
[14:24:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_:  ^^
[14:24:14] <agcolom> toddmparker_ Cool! Thanks! Will do that tomorrow then
[14:29:22] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone...
[14:29:32] <uGoMobi> good night Anne
[14:29:44] <agcolom> Have a good weekend Jasper
[14:29:59] <agcolom> (hope you get plenty of sleep ;-) )
[14:29:59] <uGoMobi> thank you, you too!
[14:30:06] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[14:30:08] <uGoMobi> haha, will be ok
[14:48:12] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: ah
[14:48:21] <toddmparker_> i saw that option, but it wasn't clear how it was used
[14:48:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: looks like the logic is already there, we just need to make it possible to set it with data-attr
[14:48:48] <toddmparker_> so if you can tidy that up and add a section showing how you can control poisitioning, that would be great
[14:48:53] <toddmparker_> i thought so
[14:49:29] <toddmparker_> it opens by default where you tapped, right?
[14:49:32] <toddmparker_> or the parent
[14:49:43] <toddmparker_> just not sure how the x, y works
[14:50:04] <uGoMobi> I think it opens from the center of the button
[14:50:17] <toddmparker_> be cool to be able to say window-200px, tap+10px
[14:50:22] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[14:51:09] <toddmparker_> if there were simple ways to just say data-position="window | tap"
[14:51:26] <toddmparker_> i can see people might want to specify a x,y which is cool
[14:52:02] <toddmparker_> if we could somehow support the window/tap with an offset, that might let you do a lot
[14:52:17] <toddmparker_> not sure that's a great idea, just throwing that out there
[14:52:44] <uGoMobi> but is that coordinate the center of the popup or the bottom left corner ?
[14:53:05] <toddmparker_> it would have to be an offset from whatever we use
[14:53:14] <toddmparker_> docs should be clear on that
[14:53:42] <toddmparker_> if it was an offset, i could say "nudge this down 30px so i can see the button instead of obscuring it"
[14:54:08] <uGoMobi> but you dont know what is the button position on the screen
[14:54:41] <toddmparker_> i need to look at ho wit works now
[14:54:54] <toddmparker_> i'm not familiar enough
[14:54:59] <uGoMobi> same here
[14:55:06] <toddmparker_> :)
[14:55:24] <toddmparker_> but let's jam on this so we're happy with positioning without add too much complexity
[14:55:37] <toddmparker_> that is the only thing i want to expose
[14:55:38] <uGoMobi> i noticed the difference in popup position between using an inline or full width button for it
[14:55:52] <toddmparker_> honestly, just being able to say "center in the window" is the main thing we need
[14:56:05] <toddmparker_> but i think explaining how it works is good for us + the docs
[14:56:12] <toddmparker_> interesting
[14:56:59] <uGoMobi> I think two options would be enough... center of window or relative to link/button that launched the popup
[14:57:28] <toddmparker_> ya
[14:57:47] <toddmparker_> and we need to show how x,y works too
[14:58:05] <uGoMobi> yes I agree
[14:58:13] <toddmparker_> cool
[15:01:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I was also thinking about max height and width
[15:02:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ was not in favor of setting max-height, but I think it would be nice if an image always fits the screen
[15:02:28] <uGoMobi> without the need to scroll
[15:02:35] <uGoMobi> should that also be optional?
[15:07:49] <toddmparker_> if that can just be set in CSS, maybe we don't need?
[15:08:04] <toddmparker_> agree that's nice for mobile esp
[15:08:35] <uGoMobi> point you cant set it with just css
[15:09:05] <uGoMobi> has to do with the framework setting a height on the parent container
[15:09:37] <uGoMobi> point is*
[15:10:48] <uGoMobi> i agree that it's best to leave it up to the developer
[15:11:15] <uGoMobi> will look into that again
[15:36:16] <toddmparker_> true
[15:36:20] <toddmparker_> give that a look then
[15:47:40] <toddmparker_> heading home everyone. have a great weekend. i'll be chipping away when i can!
[15:49:52] <uGoMobi> thanks, you too toddmparker_
