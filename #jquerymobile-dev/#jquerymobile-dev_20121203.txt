[04:49:48] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[04:53:38] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[04:56:47] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[04:57:00] <_|Nix|_> So, did I manage to un-break popup?
[04:57:15] * _|Nix|_ hopes so
[05:02:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: popups seem good now
[05:02:38] <_|Nix|_> Yaaaay!
[05:03:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so i was thinking alot about your question in the meeting last week and a way to basicly do MQ with javascript
[05:04:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: And i thought of a way to do this (assuming we fix _destroy)
[05:06:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: by using resize and pageshow you could easily destroy and create widgets based on page size
[05:12:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Funny thing is, this is probably how media queries came about in the first place.
[05:12:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: probably
[05:12:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: People were doing in JS just like that, but it was buggy, and platform-specific, etc. Now, we have media queries, but they do not go far enough.
[05:13:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ah but thats the other part of my idea
[05:13:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: use a normal css media query to set something on a div
[05:13:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see, and then using a selector in initSelector?
[05:13:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: then read that with JS
[05:14:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: when you have the less buggieness of MQ but accessible from JS
[05:14:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and a re-enhance during resize ...
[05:14:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:
[05:14:48] <arschmitz> yes
[05:15:06] <_|Nix|_> Boy ... that gets my head spinning.
[05:15:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it would take a lot of thinking about the right way to do it but im sure you could come up with a good way to wrap that up into either like a widget or event of some sort
[05:16:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The problem with resize is that it can happen /very/ often on the desktop.
[05:17:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... unilike in mobile space.
[05:17:09] <_|Nix|_> s/uni/un/
[05:17:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i was actually thinking more like throttled resize
[05:17:45] <arschmitz> oops _|Nix|_ i mean 
[05:17:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... I guess it's not so bad, as long as you don't have too many breakpoints ...
[05:18:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right and generally having too many breakpoints isnt good anyway
[05:18:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or you don't move back and forth across a breakpoint - but then you're just being a jerk.
[05:18:35] <_|Nix|_> s/jerk/tester/.
[05:18:50] <_|Nix|_> :)
[05:19:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i mean it wouldnt be perfect but i think we could do it reasonably well
[05:19:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: food for thought anyway
[05:20:31] <_|Nix|_> Definitely - and an application to keep in mind while doing the widget review.
[05:21:09] <_|Nix|_> The idea that lots of widgets are created in a tight loop should always be in the back of our mind when we look at a widget.
[05:21:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup there is a lot to think about when reviewing the widgets 
[05:23:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the ideal solution is always going to be a css / MQ solution but a mechanisim like this would have uses for sure

[07:47:51] <toddmparker> hi all
[07:50:44] <toddmparker> i have the 13" rMBP
[07:50:57] <toddmparker> boy, all the crazies were out this weekend in the tracker
[07:51:12] <toddmparker> close, close, close 'em
[08:20:51] <gseguin> mornin'
[08:21:10] <gseguin> reminder JSConf go on sale in less than 40 min
[08:21:56] <gseguin> I hope you've practiced your CTRL+R skills !
[08:30:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[08:31:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Pong!
[08:31:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey, I can look at #5327 ...
[08:31:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Check why those tests fail, if they still fail.
[08:31:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool?
[08:31:42] <uGoMobi> sure
[08:31:52] <_|Nix|_> Woah! Where's my auto-replace?
[08:32:40] <toddmparker> jlembeck is making good progress on panels - http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel/docs/panels/index.html
[08:32:58] <toddmparker> we're going to re-name "push" to "pan"
[08:33:35] <toddmparker> and create a 3rd display mode called "push" that looks like Facebook at narrow widths but at wider widths, the panel will push the page over and cause it to reflow so you can leave it open
[08:33:53] <toddmparker> like the folder list on apple mail
[08:34:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: sounds good
[08:34:21] <toddmparker> so it's way to show or hide a column at wider widths
[08:34:36] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: cool
[08:34:43] <toddmparker> naming ideas welcome
[08:35:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Re:5327 - I think he didn't look into collapsible set options at all
[08:35:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I wanted to give him the chance to do that after all
[08:36:05] <uGoMobi> but if no response I close the PR and make the changes myself
[08:36:23] <uGoMobi> not sure how much time we should give to respond
[08:47:10] <arschmitz> Hi toddmparker: i like the panel ideas those are going to be a great feature
[08:48:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker: how do you like your 13" retina? im debating between a 13" air and a 13" retina to replace my POS sony viao
[08:51:05] <Wilto> Back again.
[08:51:11] <Wilto> arschmitz: I do, yeah.
[08:51:29] <Wilto> For real: this thing is dope.
[08:51:37] <Wilto> I kinda got a lemon, but it’s still an amazing machine.
[08:51:51] <arschmitz> Wilto: cool i was just windering how you like it debating between a 13" retina and a 13" air
[08:52:52] <Wilto> I loved my Air too, in fairness. This thing is surprisingly light, though.
[08:53:03] <Wilto> And I have the 15"
[08:53:28] <arschmitz> yeah the 13air vs 13 retina there is almost no difference in size or weight anymore
[08:54:17] <toddmparker> arschmitz: tough one
[08:54:22] <arschmitz> my concern with the air is a i tend to take multi-tasking to the extreme lots and lots of open windows programs vms all at once 
[08:54:31] <toddmparker> they are host close to identical, perf-wise
[08:54:50] <toddmparker> mbp is ~10% faster or whatever
[08:54:59] <toddmparker> I love the screen though
[08:55:23] <toddmparker> i think if you're doing web dev, you need a retina display just so you're always keeping tabs on HD
[08:55:41] <toddmparker> I have a thunderbolt monitor to see things at SD
[08:55:59] <gseguin> can you say that to my manager toddmparker ? :)
[08:56:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thats a good point with the screen
[08:56:54] <gseguin> The new employees just got the MBP 15 w/ retina, 16GB and SSD
[08:57:03] <gseguin> I so want one of these
[08:57:58] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: I want one too...
[08:58:05] <Wilto> Just keep in mind that Retina means every website you visit is gonna be freakin’ huge.
[08:58:41] <ryanneufeld> are we getting rid of #jquerymobile in favor or #jquery?
[08:59:04] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: I think I saw a ticket about this yes
[08:59:06] <Wilto> Like, http://www.apple.com/iphone/ is almost eight megs.
[08:59:50] * ryanneufeld actually checks the topic and sees it's been done.
[08:59:51] <Wilto> eight megs
[08:59:56] <Wilto> eight. megabytes.
[09:01:25] <toddmparker> light as air, that page is
[09:02:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker: need to start using your responsive image technique !
[09:08:57] <Wilto> WHO SAID RESPONSIVE IMAGE
[09:20:39] <Krinkle> Wilto: 2.78 MB with no cache
[09:20:49] <Wilto> Retina?
[09:21:23] <Krinkle> desktop monitor, letting page load and scrolling to bottom and back up
[09:21:26] <Krinkle> 109 requests, 2.78 MB
[09:21:46] <Krinkle> actually lot less requests, Chrome counts data URI too
[09:22:15] <Wilto> Yeah, it’s absurd either way. Retina images are brutal, though.
[09:28:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I can take the PR, apply it to a branch, and then push the complete feature.
[09:29:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I already have in a branch
[09:29:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, Cool! What's the name?
[09:29:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and I can make the necessary chances later
[09:29:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, OK.
[09:29:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was more wondering how we treat those PR's in general
[09:30:00] <uGoMobi> when only half the work is done
[09:30:46] <uGoMobi> I only pulled his changes local, didn't push that branch yet
[09:31:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think it's fine to accept and apply in a modified fashion.
[09:31:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, it does do /some/ of the work, right?
[09:31:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes it is a beginning
[09:31:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The chance that an incomplete PR gets accepted is still smaller than the chance that a complete PR gets accepted.
[09:32:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.

[10:36:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: so does that mean it's a big NO to using tabs?
[10:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> Unless we write code to make links work.
[10:36:57] <agcolom> ok.... (sorry that came in the wrong window!)
[10:37:35] <agcolom> otherwise, do you like the idea or do you think we should find something else?
[10:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not a fan of tabs.
[10:40:39] <scott_gonzalez> It makes searching the page harder.
[10:40:48] <agcolom> ok... 
[10:48:50] <jlembeck> when calling widget functions, if a property is stated, but its value is undefined, it overwrites a default value. Is this by design? Example:
[10:49:15] <jlembeck> https://gist.github.com/60cf3c0cfa8efac48902
[10:49:56] <jlembeck> if this.options.dismissible was true in the defaults, but data-dimissible was not on the link, it overwrites the true with undefined
[10:50:12] <jlembeck> I can probably handle this a different way, but that feels strange. Is that just the way it is done?
[10:51:31] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: no that is not how it is supposed to be
[10:55:27] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: hrmm.. that's not good then.
[10:55:54] <jlembeck> gnarf: I've been told we have a sweet IRC bouncer thing, Wilto told me to hit you up to get in on that
[10:56:09] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: if you use this.options.optionName the widget factory check if that data- attribute has been set
[10:56:37] <jlembeck> yeah, except in my case, it's a link that has the data attributes that are being set
[10:56:43] <jlembeck> not the widget itself
[10:56:54] <uGoMobi> and only if the data- attribute is set it changes the value of that option
[10:58:22] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: you only want to check on the link
[10:58:48] <uGoMobi> shouldn't it be possible to programmatically set those options?
[10:59:15] <jlembeck> yeah, so I call .panel( "toggle" , { //options defined on the link })
[10:59:21] <jlembeck> when the link is clicked
[11:02:48] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: the panel is a bit different case like popup because you can set things on the panel div and on the link I suppose?
[11:02:59] <jlembeck> yeah
[11:03:10] <jlembeck> it's a bit of an odd use case, I admit
[11:05:10] <uGoMobi> normally you can just use this.option.dismissable but in this case the widget factory will look on the div with data-role="panel" and not on the link

[11:09:41] <uGoMobi> does something like that work?
[11:11:01] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and jlembeck - might be worth looking at how pages work in addition to popups, both are link configured
[11:11:31] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes you are right
[11:19:40] <jlembeck> I've got a temp solution. Burning through some bugs. It's green now, I'll refactor during cleanup
[11:20:01] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: ok
[11:20:52] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: in page and popup widgets we don't check for the data- attribute, only the options object

[11:34:08] <jlembeck> awesome.

[11:38:36] <toddmparker> huh
[11:38:49] <toddmparker> you see my latest changes?
[11:38:54] <toddmparker> maybe i broke something
[11:39:04] <toddmparker> see grouped buttons for the top demos?
[11:39:21] <jlembeck> yup
[11:39:24] <toddmparker> try the overlay under "Right Panel: Details"
[11:39:41] <jlembeck> Then, you're clicking in the panel and it's closing?
[11:39:42] <toddmparker> left is ok
[11:39:45] <toddmparker> yep
[11:39:47] <jlembeck> wow
[11:39:48] <jlembeck> um
[11:39:51] <jlembeck> not happening for me

[11:40:05] <jlembeck> chrome?
[11:40:10] <toddmparker> yep

[11:54:48] <jlembeck> (the width and positioning of the clickover element is all wrong)

[12:07:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yup
[12:08:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: re: widget factory options/data- attributes
[12:08:44] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: I'd go with .panel( "option", "dismissible", newValue ) rather than .panel( "toggle", "dismissible", newValue );
[12:08:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how does it work if you can set the data- attribute on both the link and the element?
[12:09:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let me check - I forgot.
[12:09:52] <jlembeck> yeah, i'm noticing popup does something very similar
[12:09:56] <jlembeck> for transition off of the link
[12:10:19] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Actually, in that case, you don't want to set the option.
[12:10:39] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Inside a widget, this.options.* should always coincide with the values of data-* ...
[12:11:00] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: What you want is to pass an options object to the panel's open method (assuming it has an open method).
[12:11:18] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: You compute the values you wanna pass to open() inside the options object in the link handler.
[12:11:44] <jlembeck> yup. doing that, and it's super successful
[12:11:45] <jlembeck> in all cases
[12:11:46] <jlembeck> except
[12:12:04] <jlembeck> { foo: undefined }
[12:12:08] <jlembeck> that will overwrite
[12:12:12] <jlembeck> this.options.foo
[12:12:18] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: jlembeck https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/74f1914f9417114e832a61e3c17c42dc08615588/js/widgets/popup.js#L850
[12:12:59] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: It shouldn't. Inside open() you need to copy the option to an internal variable: this._foo = options.foo || this.options.foo;
[12:13:12] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/m4QH7A
[12:13:12] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14f7609f2 15Jasper de Groot: Merge branch 'collapsible-no-icon'
[12:13:46] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: And then this._foo is the value used for this particular instance of the widget's action, whereas this.options.foo is used if data-foo is not specified on the link.
[12:15:14] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: So, basically, for every option accessible both via the widget and the link, you need to create a variable that's internal to the widget, and copy into it either the value passed into open() or, if absent, the value present in this.options.
[12:16:45] <_|Nix|_> I can't wait for the widget review. Handling options right is a major issue - we might even want to add some code to $.mobile.widget for handling this option-on-the-widget vs. option-on-the-link juggling.
[12:17:00] <jlembeck> yeah. This doesn't feel right.
[12:18:15] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Widgets such as popup have to handle two lifecycles: the widget lifecycle between _create() and _destroy(), and the active lifecycle between open() and close(). That's why we need to copy over some options.
[12:18:28] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Welcome to the club!
[12:19:30] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Pages don't really have this problem, because most of the page show/hide options are handled by nav.
[12:19:51] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: ... that's because nav needs to coordinate multiple pages.
[12:20:30] <toddmparker> looks like we're going to need to come up with a better approach for these widgets that have links controlling/configuring them
[12:20:52] <toddmparker> seems like we all agree this isn't ideal
[12:23:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We've also agreed earlier that it doesn't make sense for /all/ options to be settable via links, and some can't be set via the link. For example: <a data-theme="b" ...>Blah</a> affects the link, not the theme of the popup it opens.
[12:24:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's why I think this pattern of open( options ); ... close() might need to be abstracted away into a behaviour, or a class or something.
[12:25:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We might even be able to factor out a lot of code common between popup and panel.
[12:27:51] <toddmparker> agreed
[12:28:30] <toddmparker> it's for cases where multiple links may invoke a widget but need options for some things
[12:28:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yep.
[12:28:57] <toddmparker> having this built into the widget factory or as part of a standardized utility/pattern would be ideal
[12:29:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: A standard way to mesh the options from the link with those from the widget would be good.
[12:29:30] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: like you said, we set the precedent on transitions for nag, but it was less of a complex thing to pull off
[12:29:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: toddmparker: jlembeck: just catching up here but i think we just need come up with a set flow of how options like this will be handled and what takes priority then it will be easy to come up with a uniform handler for this situation
[12:30:03] <toddmparker> arschmitz: right
[12:30:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is this also something we can fix with _setOption 
[12:30:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. This is different. _setOption is restricted to updating widget options, not link options.
[12:30:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This is about how we use options, not about how we maintain options.
[12:31:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[12:31:17] <_|Nix|_> I can think of one: var o = this._mergeOptions( options, this.options );
[12:31:28] <_|Nix|_> Where _mergeOptions is an extension.
[12:31:35] <_|Nix|_> It would be a lot like $.extend.
[12:31:43] <_|Nix|_> We might event be able to use $.extend for this.
[12:31:58] <_|Nix|_> But we'd still need to choose by hand which options we pick up from the link.
[12:32:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it would just be a normal widget extension
[12:32:06] <uGoMobi> was thinking if we use _setOption we can change the option on the fly if there is a data- attribute on the link
[12:32:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like I said - $.extend can probably do this.
[12:32:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. No. No. No.
[12:32:30] <uGoMobi> but I leave this to you experts :)
[12:32:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Very important not to touch the widget option.
[12:32:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you dont want to overwrite the options set on the widget
[12:32:57] <_|Nix|_> Exactly.
[12:33:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I thought that was what we wanted to do
[12:33:07] <arschmitz> just override them this one time
[12:33:15] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:33:18] <_|Nix|_> The link options live only for the duration of an open()/close() cycle, and are not recorder.
[12:33:21] <uGoMobi> i see the difference
[12:33:23] <_|Nix|_> s/recorder/recorded/
[12:34:00] <_|Nix|_> The conclusion is that they need to be copied during open() and merged with this.options.
[12:34:15] <_|Nix|_> $.extend does exactly this.
[12:34:34] <uGoMobi> would be nice if we could do something similar for collapsible / collapsible set
[12:34:37] <jlembeck> it's not just that that is the problem
[12:34:47] <jlembeck> Well, maybe.
[12:34:48] <_|Nix|_> However, I need to check exactly how it behaves. That is, what is the effect of $.extend( {}, { foo: 1 }, { foo: 2 } );
[12:35:13] <jlembeck> I feel like if I push { foo: undefined } in, maybe it shouldn't override this.options.foo
[12:35:25] <jlembeck> if that's disagreed, I totally understand
[12:35:29] <jlembeck> but right now, that's the case
[12:35:56] <agcolom> Good evening!
[12:36:02] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[12:36:05] <jlembeck> agcolom: Hey
[12:36:07] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Like I said: this._foo = optionsFromOpen.foo || this.options.foo; Then you use this._foo throught the open()/close() cycle.
[12:36:22] <jlembeck> Yeah, _|Nix|_, I'm doing something similar to that right now, but it feels like a hack
[12:36:27] <jlembeck> so that's why I brought it up
[12:36:35] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: It's not. We have no choice.
[12:36:39] <agcolom> Could someone check something for me please? 
[12:36:44] <agcolom> http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/page-loading/ 
[12:36:55] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: this.options.* are sacred values, because they were set by the user. We must never overwrite them.
[12:37:20] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: ... and we must always honour them, unless there's an override from the link.
[12:37:25] <agcolom> because we didn't have the standard pages for this one, it would be great if someone could check that I haven't made mistakes...
[12:37:26] <arschmitz> they should only be overwriden by a call to _setOption
[12:37:36] <jlembeck> _|Nix|_: we're currently overriding them
[12:37:38] <agcolom> (in particular events, options and methods...)
[12:38:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: what exactly needs to be checked?
[12:38:05] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: That's good, just don't save the overridden value back into this.options ...
[12:38:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ah sorry, you just said it
[12:38:33] <agcolom> yes ;-) please :-) 
[12:38:36] <_|Nix|_> I can try to modify popup a bit to be more systematic about override values.
[12:38:43] <arschmitz> agcolom: the demo at the bottom does not seem to be working
[12:38:54] <agcolom> yes, that;s a FF bug...
[12:39:05] <arschmitz> agcolom: im on chrome
[12:39:23] <_|Nix|_> Instead of storing this._transition, and this._positionTo, I can create a variable like, this._currentOptions which has properties transition and popsitionTo ...
[12:39:28] <agcolom> oh, it's a fF and Chrome bug then ;-)
[12:39:44] <_|Nix|_> ... and calcualte the value of that variable during open().
[12:40:01] <_|Nix|_> That would be systematic ...
[12:40:07] <agcolom> It's when there's no # in the URL...
[12:40:07] <uGoMobi> I had some problems getting my methods demos to work too agcolom 
[12:40:45] <uGoMobi> but have to give it closer look to see if that's not a mistake in my code
[12:40:49] <agcolom> if you have a # it's fine, see http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/page-loading/#option-html
[12:40:49] <_|Nix|_> Ha! $.extend does exactly what we want.

[12:41:32] <uGoMobi> Wilto: nice!
[12:41:41] <_|Nix|_> For each key foo in the given set of objects, it creates a new object where foo has the value of the last $.extend argument that included the key foo.
[12:41:54] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/unprefixed-transitions
[12:42:04] <_|Nix|_> So, $.extend( {}, { foo: 1 }, { foo: 2 } ) results in { foo: 2 } ...
[12:42:06] <Wilto> TL;DR: Transitions in IE10.
[12:42:12] <Wilto> But we gotta test the hell out of… the test.
[12:42:17] <uGoMobi> agcolom: with # the loader demos don't work either
[12:42:44] <agcolom> have you tried with #something?
[12:42:50] <uGoMobi> Wilto: any ugly hacks needed to make the tests work on IE?
[12:42:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ do you think this is something we should look at making an abstraction of so we can just tack it onto widgets. or maybe build into the mobile base widget as a built in method?
[12:43:02] <Wilto> Nope. Just had to modify our validStyle test a bit.
[12:43:05] <agcolom> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/11
[12:43:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I tried that link ^^ #options-html
[12:43:28] <agcolom> really? works fine for me!
[12:43:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I don't think it's worth the code, since $.extend does /all/ the heavy lifting.
[12:43:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: will try later without cache
[12:43:49] <arschmitz> true pretty easy only a few lines to add where needed
[12:43:51] <agcolom> ok
[12:43:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Panel and popup simply need to use $.extend.
[12:44:22] <arschmitz> there are other potential use cases but its so simple your right i think its pointless
[12:44:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: var o = $.extend( {}, this.options, options );
[12:44:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wham! Bam!
[12:45:05] <uGoMobi> you ok _|Nix|_ ?
[12:45:25] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:45:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think as part of our widget review we should come up with a set of best practices for JQM widget that are in addition to the normal widget factory ones and document things like this
[12:46:35] <arschmitz> toddmparker:^^
[12:47:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: nah, loader demo doesn't work
[12:49:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom: will read the whole page tomorrow and check if demos work if i try local
[12:49:03] <agcolom> oh, yes it doesn't work! 
[12:49:25] <agcolom> i thought you meant it doesn't show anything....
[12:49:40] <uGoMobi> it doesn't show a loader
[12:49:44] <agcolom> We can have a much simpler actually.... 
[12:50:28] <agcolom> doing some work work this evening... may have a look later (unless I fall asleep first ;-) )
[12:50:40] <uGoMobi> :D
[12:50:42] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:51:02] <agcolom> uGoMobi: will let you know if I manage to get it to work... 
[12:51:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom:  ok
[12:51:53] <agcolom> I have to give slots to my 80 students for their work demos wednesday and thursday...
[12:54:42] <Wilto> This may shock all of you, but IE10 is kind of a pain in the ass.
[12:55:34] <arschmitz> Wilto: Don't tell lies like that. 
[12:56:28] <mspisars> Wilto: that comment made my day!
[12:57:21] <Wilto> Any volunteers to help test that branch?
[12:57:37] <uGoMobi> Wilto: transitions look ok
[12:57:54] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I just tested IE10/Win8 on Virtualbox
[12:58:23] <Wilto> Solid?
[12:58:31] <uGoMobi> will check the other browsers on Linux and Win7
[12:58:32] <toddmparker> anyone have a surface (hahaha)
[12:58:32] <Wilto> Oh, “transitions look ok.” Sweet.
[12:58:38] <Wilto> lol surface
[12:58:40] <uGoMobi> no thanks toddmparker 
[12:59:00] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: great that extend will do the trick / jlembeck 
[12:59:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: people might actually buy them if they actually had the intel based ones avalible!
[12:59:26] <toddmparker> arschmitz: hells yeah, we should review everything, document patterns and re-factor
[13:00:01] <toddmparker> heard the "pro" version was going to be $$ and get 2-3 hours of battery. not good enough.
[13:00:53] <Wilto> The UltraPro™ version costs $2,000 and boasts twelve minutes of battery life.
[13:00:54] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i just think it would be good to come up with a solid set of best practices for things like this auto initalizing the added method's from the mobile base widget etc and then start really preaching them to people writing widgets 
[13:00:58] <Wilto> And takes diesel fuel.
[13:01:09] <toddmparker> you bet arschmitz 
[13:01:26] <arschmitz> Wilto: must be operated in a large well ventilated area
[13:01:36] <toddmparker> there is a lot of power in the widget factory and getting people to use it well is important
[13:01:42] <toddmparker> ui has a guide somewhere
[13:02:14] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yes i think we should link to theres and are should build on theres for all the special mobile stuff
[13:02:25] <arschmitz> are/ours
[13:03:15] <toddmparker> yeah, we have extras
[13:03:45] <arschmitz> toddmparker: there are also some special considerations with mobile that we want to make sure people think about
[13:04:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Another one for the widget review: Some of our widgets have enable()/disable() methods. So does the widget factory. Its methods simply _setOption( "disabled", newValue ). We should move the bodies of our methods to our own _setOption( "disabled", ... ) handler.
[13:04:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: absolutely
[13:05:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and all our widgets need to handle _setOption( "disabled", newValue ) ...
[13:05:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... even though the widgets themselves have no "disabled" option of their own - they all inherit such an option from the widget factory ...
[13:05:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So yeah ... massive ...
[13:06:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah but your right we need to handle everything the widget factory makes avalible 
[13:08:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: even if its a lot of work or a pain its part of using the widget factory properly
[13:09:15] <_|Nix|_> *nod*
[13:09:56] <arschmitz> once we get rolling on it it wont be so bad because the strategy to implemnt things things will generally be the same in each widget
[13:21:21] <toddmparker> be great to have the two of you tag teaming on that.
[13:21:46] <toddmparker> jlembeck: the "links" option - what's that about?
[13:21:56] <toddmparker> is that to keep track of what link opened it?
[13:22:00] <jlembeck> yes.
[13:22:25] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Wait a sec ... don't store stuff in options that can go into internal variables!
[13:22:27] <jlembeck> I suppose it doesn't need to be in the options section, I just liked it there while I was coding
[13:22:51] <jlembeck> kept my head straight while I was in that
[13:23:05] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Pick your options very, very carefully! We're gonna need to make them all work on-the-fly later!
[13:23:41] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: he only has the most basic ones, that's why I was asking
[13:24:03] <toddmparker> if this is only needed to handle the link-based panel stuff, we can probably move it to an internal
[13:24:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK - I'm just paranoid about adding new ones.
[13:24:18] <toddmparker> was trying to figure out a useful reason to set that via js
[13:24:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, and pass it in via a method.
[13:24:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: .panel( open, { link: $link } ) ...
[13:24:52] <jlembeck> that change has already been made
[13:24:59] <jlembeck> and it's being handled just like _|Nix|_ just said
[13:25:16] <jlembeck> .panel( "toggle" , { link: $link } )
[13:25:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Popup had that for a while, but I yanked that recently, because I wasn't actually using the link for anything. It was probably when we were considering repositioning over the origin.
[13:26:18] <_|Nix|_> I actually just saved 9 lines of code by switching to $.extend ...
[13:26:25] <_|Nix|_> ... inside popup ...

[13:39:14] <Wilto> what the
[13:40:00] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: just noticed the popup doesn't have a create event
[13:40:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We talked about this. It does have a create event.
[13:40:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's prefixed with "popup" if you attach via bind(), but it's called "create" if you attach during popup's creation via .popup( { "create" : function() {} );
[13:41:37] <toddmparker> right, i remember. so the docs are just wrong? http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/events.html
[13:41:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, either .popup ( {create: function() { /* handler */ }} ) or .bind( "popupcreate", function() { /* handler */ } );
[13:41:59] <toddmparker> oh, was this the one that was correct in the API docs, but not here?
[13:42:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, I guess that's missing.
[13:42:09] <toddmparker> these two docs sites are a pain
[13:42:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think so.
[13:42:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, the old one is on its way out, so we don't need to worry so much about fixing it.
[13:43:15] <toddmparker> agcolom has you back here - http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/popup/#event-create
[13:43:27] <toddmparker> i was only looking because i wanted an example for panel

[14:11:10] <agcolom> uGoMobi: by now looking at the example in more detail, I think I did something wrong in the docs... so in the page loading widget, all the data- attributes used by Maurice for the demo do not actually exist?
[14:11:45] <agcolom> (If that's the case, it's easy enough to remove them from the api docs)
[14:13:05] <agcolom> ok, bedtime for me! If you could leave a message here for me, I'll check it in the morning :-) Thank you :-)
[14:13:15] <arschmitz> agcolom: demo looks good now
[14:13:35] <agcolom> thanks arschmitz :-) yes, I forgot the javascript! 
[14:13:45] <agcolom> had forgotten ^
[14:13:46] <arschmitz> agcolom: one sugestion add one more button to the list to close the loader :)
[14:13:59] <agcolom> is it not there?
[14:14:01] <arschmitz> agcolom: never mind had to scroll
[14:14:30] <arschmitz> agcolom: it is my fault didnt realize i hadent scrolled all the way down

[15:49:27] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you here?
[15:50:10] <toddmparker> i need your eyes…i added an inset looking shadow by adding a shadow to the overlay layer on the panels
[15:50:24] <toddmparker> i wanted to animate that drop shadow because the panels slide in, but it doesn't seem to work. prolly because we're adding it to the overlay and that is dynamically generated?
[15:50:34] <toddmparker> this is for pan and push
