[07:00:22] <toddparker> nice article _nickel
[07:00:39] <aaronmcadam> ?
[07:00:47] <aaronmcadam> hi todd you alrighty
[10:04:46] <toddparker> hi aaronmcadam
[10:06:29] <RwL> hey, are there source files available for the icons used in jQuery Mobile? Would like to customize but only the optimized PNGs appear to be in the GitHub repo.
[11:27:31] <gseguin> toddparker:
[11:27:36] <gseguin> ping
[12:44:44] <toddparker> gseguin, sorry running out to a meeting
[12:45:00] <toddparker> scott is on email and aim if you want to get him here
[15:45:23] <RwL> another question about the jQuery Mobile icons... I noticed they're saved as 8-bit PNGs... is that intentional; does one or more of the supported phones not support PNG-24 (Win Mobile 7, I'm assuming)?
[15:45:48] <RwL> The fact that they're saved out as 8-bit makes them especially hard to modify. Would be so awesome to get source files for these if they exist.
[15:51:34] <gseguin> RwL: you'll have to catch scottjehl (I think) to get that explained
[15:51:46] <RwL> thanks gseguin
[15:51:59] <gseguin> you're welcome
[16:05:55] <_nickel> toddparker: kin's relative url change is in and the tests have been updated
[16:05:58] <_nickel> that one took a while :(
[16:06:26] <_nickel> if the tests fails I'll address that now hopefully and then tomorrow move on to helping scott out on testing
[16:18:30] <_nickel> toddparker: yah we still have the outstanding dialog bug
