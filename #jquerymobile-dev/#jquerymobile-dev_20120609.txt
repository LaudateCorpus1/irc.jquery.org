[02:37:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] correction to expanded icon default [1.1.1] - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[02:42:39] <agcolom> gseguin, I couldn't cherry-pick the above to 1.1-stable because https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/37130102654b1b05f9e69320db60b480d2abeaba#docs/content/content-collapsible-options.html is not in 1.1-stable. Should it be there or is it only for 1.2?

[14:02:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne, just saw your email
[14:13:59] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[14:14:08] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[14:14:16] <agcolom> just one quick thing...
[14:14:21] <uGoMobi> tell me
[14:14:31] <agcolom> hope you're having a good weekend...
[14:14:53] <agcolom> just one thing in master... you've added height 20px to...
[14:15:00] <uGoMobi> yeah except the Dutch team lost and EC Football :(
[14:15:01] <agcolom> let me check the name...
[14:15:17] <agcolom> sorry to hear!!!! France plays England on Monday!!!
[14:15:20] <uGoMobi> yes i know what you mean ... controlgroup buttons
[14:15:25] <agcolom> (I'm going to hide ;-) )
[14:15:29] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:15:40] <uGoMobi> you want a draw?
[14:16:09] <agcolom> yes, the control groups. so they look taller in the docs... I'll give you a page link to look at...
[14:16:21] <agcolom> (hope France wins ;-) )
[14:16:25] <uGoMobi> haha ok
[14:16:46] <uGoMobi> what browser do they look taller?
[14:16:47] <agcolom> but may lead to conflicts in the office ;-) never mind...
[14:16:52] <agcolom> FF
[14:17:07] <uGoMobi> haha... just ignore subject football on monday ;)
[14:17:11] <uGoMobi> ok FF
[14:17:45] <agcolom> look at http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-options.html and compare with http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/content/content-collapsible-options.html
[14:18:50] <uGoMobi> looking
[14:18:52] <agcolom> Also in Safari
[14:19:24] <uGoMobi> ah i see
[14:19:28] <agcolom> (Safari 5.1.5, FF12.0 )
[14:21:58] <uGoMobi> I see the stylesheet for the docs use an adjusted font-size for the buttons
[14:22:17] <uGoMobi> while we decided to make it a fixed font size
[14:22:18] <agcolom> Ah ok...
[14:22:45] <uGoMobi> docs have font size 80% for that controlgroup
[14:22:52] <agcolom> yes
[14:23:14] <agcolom> so maybe we could override the default for these ones?
[14:23:38] <uGoMobi> or set them to mini
[14:23:59] <uGoMobi> another point is the vertical alignment
[14:24:09] <agcolom> yes
[14:24:14] <uGoMobi> at first I did line-height 20px instead of height
[14:24:40] <uGoMobi> but opera mini ignores font-sizes
[14:24:43] <agcolom> I think the idea for those ones was that they fit the iPhone screen and do not break
[14:24:56] <uGoMobi> which causes the height to be different as well
[14:25:04] <agcolom> ok
[14:25:16] <agcolom> (hence the 80% font size I think)
[14:25:47] <uGoMobi> with line-height text would be aligned vertical even when you set it to a smaller font size which we do for the docs
[14:25:52] <agcolom> what is the font difference between normal and mini?
[14:26:13] <uGoMobi> 16px normal, 12.5 = 13px for mini
[14:26:33] <uGoMobi> so mini will be same as 80% of 16px
[14:27:08] <uGoMobi> of course we could also override the rules I added
[14:27:33] <agcolom> yes, just worked out would be 81% so virtually the same. We could do that I suppose, if the 1% difference is ok on iPhone screen not to break...
[14:27:58] <agcolom> Shall we wait until toddparker is around and ask him ?
[14:28:18] <agcolom> at least we have a few options to propose ;-)
[14:28:41] <uGoMobi> actually i want to get rid of that fix height
[14:28:48] <agcolom> ok
[14:28:48] <uGoMobi> fixed*
[14:29:21] <uGoMobi> maybe change it back to line-height and see what i can do for opera mini
[14:29:50] <agcolom> up to you on that one really... You're the boss ;-)
[14:30:13] <uGoMobi> idea behind fixed height is that you can combine icon-only and text-buttons in a controlgroup
[14:30:20] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:31:09] <agcolom> oh so are icons only buttons bigger now?
[14:31:16] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:31:23] <uGoMobi> when in controlgroup
[14:31:43] <uGoMobi> http://ugomobi.github.com/buttons-form/buttons-form-new.html#new-controlgroup
[14:31:44] <agcolom> look http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-icons.html
[14:31:54] <agcolom> at the bottom of the page
[14:32:30] <uGoMobi> i see
[14:32:48] <agcolom> well can be a nice thing...
[14:33:10] <uGoMobi> we should adjust that example
[14:33:14] <uGoMobi> good catch
[14:34:01] <uGoMobi> its mentioned in the docs that when you use horizontal controlgroup they might break when not enough available space
[14:34:03] <agcolom> data-inline buttons are no longer compact
[14:34:16] <uGoMobi> this example does not really reflect real use case of course
[14:34:37] <uGoMobi> inline buttons didnt change
[14:35:00] <uGoMobi> just a minor change on padding
[14:36:00] <agcolom> no ignore what I just said about inline buttons... thay are still compact!
[14:36:03] <agcolom> they
[14:36:52] <uGoMobi> i will change those ultra large controlgroup examples in multiple groups
[14:37:01] <agcolom> (the bottom of that page, I was mentioning the change in height)
[14:37:24] <uGoMobi> yes that is on purpose
[14:37:43] <uGoMobi> look at 1.1 and try to click just one of the buttons ;)
[14:38:09] <agcolom> yes I know ;-)
[14:38:24] <uGoMobi> http://ugomobi.github.com/buttons-form/buttons-form-new.html#new-controlgroup
[14:38:41] <uGoMobi> there you can see mixed hor. controlgroup at the bottom
[14:39:07] <agcolom> very nice!!!
[14:39:16] <uGoMobi> right header button links to example how it was
[14:41:44] <agcolom> yes, that's great!!! So I guess you've been able to close many issues that were relating to that!
[14:42:19] <uGoMobi> yeah just looked at all open issues regarding buttons and form css
[14:42:44] <uGoMobi> biggest change is the forms being full width now
[14:43:00] <agcolom> Cool!
[14:44:00] <agcolom> That must have kept you busy for a while !
[14:44:15] <uGoMobi> haha i can't deny that
[14:44:48] <uGoMobi> when you fix one thing you create two new issues with this kind of stuff ;)
[14:45:06] <agcolom> oh yes ;)
[14:45:11] <uGoMobi> so I actually wanted to hide this week ;)
[14:45:11] <agcolom> Ok, i think it's bed time for me ;-)
[14:45:21] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:45:28] <uGoMobi> thanks for the pointer
[14:45:32] <uGoMobi> will fix it now
[14:45:33] <agcolom> I think everyone likes the new form elements ;-)
[14:45:40] <uGoMobi> hope so
[14:45:40] <agcolom> (look I mean)
[14:46:11] <agcolom> you're welcome.... I thought it was my eyes going funny after spending too much time looking at the docs@
[14:46:13] <agcolom> !
[14:46:18] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne and enjoy the rest of the weekend
[14:46:23] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:46:33] <uGoMobi> reminds me of one the first issues i opened
[14:46:40] <agcolom> Goodnight and same to you.

[14:46:46] <agcolom> ah!
[14:46:55] <uGoMobi> i was so into the page transitions
[14:47:23] <agcolom> was that a long time ago?
[14:47:24] <uGoMobi> that i didnt understand why i saw them on opera mini while docs said it shouldnt be there
[14:47:37] <uGoMobi> totally forgot opera mini always uses slide
[14:47:38] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:47:52] <agcolom> excellent!!!!
[14:47:56] <uGoMobi> couple of months ago
