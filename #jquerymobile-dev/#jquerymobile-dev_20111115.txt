[07:45:01] <Wilto> xjjk: We generally regard UA detection as an absolute last resort—and even then, it would likely only happen in the event of a critical and systemic problem that forces us to reduce the entire experience for that device/browser.
[07:50:23] <toddmparker_> hey all - started collecting some stuff to talk about for 1.next
[07:50:24] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.next-planning
[07:52:05] <aaronmcadam> dammit, having some real issues with some appended content, the <ul> in my content doesn't get displayed at all
[07:53:13] <aaronmcadam> could it be because the content is appended into a listview item?
[07:53:44] <aaronmcadam> I'll make a fiddle
[08:07:30] <aaronmcadam> phew fixed it, was bad html coming through templates!

[08:52:32] <toddmparker_> i've had 3 reports of this SVG issue. If this is a simple fix, let's land it because it throws errors

[09:07:32] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[09:08:06] <toddmparker_> miketaylr: what's the latest on opera's support for hw accel transitions in mobile?
[09:08:18] <miketaylr> toddmparker_: in progress, i believe
[09:08:20] <toddmparker_> wondering if we should re-start that conversation
[09:08:27] <miketaylr> but not shipped yet
[09:08:41] <toddmparker_> think it may in the next 2-3 months?
[09:08:43] <gseguin> hey toddmparker_
[09:08:47] <gseguin> what's up?
[09:08:53] <toddmparker_> not much gseguin
[09:09:05] <toddmparker_> you on the clock today?
[09:09:10] <gseguin> tomorrow
[09:09:19] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[09:09:20] <gseguin> unless it's urgent
[09:09:27] <toddmparker_> i'll leave you alone
[09:09:36] <toddmparker_> tho do give some thought to the 1.next stuff
[09:09:45] <toddmparker_> we can discuss on thursday
[09:09:49] <gseguin> I glanced it in the morning
[09:09:59] <toddmparker_> feel free to edit
[09:10:27] <gseguin> The tablet story is high priority I think
[09:11:41] <toddmparker_> yeah, agreed
[09:11:49] <toddmparker_> i just want to fix what we have first
[09:12:17] <toddmparker_> the tablet stuff may end up being a series of tools that end up being some full-blown thing over releases
[09:12:40] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: thanks for those pulls. i'll let johnbender give those a look
[09:12:49] <toddmparker_> question: you familiar with lucene?

[09:27:14] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'll land that SVG fix after I test out the perf implication
[09:27:21] <kinblas> .. if any
[09:40:06] <toddmparker_> ok, thanks kinblas
[09:40:13] <toddmparker_> figure throwing an error is bad
[09:40:22] <toddmparker_> 3 diff. issues on it recently
[09:40:27] <kinblas> toddmparker_: tests show it's 50% slower, but it might not matter because our nesting is not that deep
[09:40:41] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[09:40:46] <toddmparker_> 50% of what?
[09:40:57] <kinblas> toddmparker_: using typeof versus existence
[09:41:09] <kinblas> but I guess SVG is forcing our hand here
[09:41:10] <kinblas> :-)

[09:41:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3048 from agcolom/patch-34 - Todd Parker
[09:41:48] <toddmparker_> what would that end up adding to a page? 10ms 100ms
[09:44:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: this is only an issue when clicking on something in the page
[09:44:26] <toddmparker_> for some reason, i though one said when you mouseover too
[09:44:30] <kinblas> when the framework detects a click, it tries to figure out if it was in a button or not ... that's what the code in question is about
[09:45:08] <kinblas> toddmparker_: the real issue is that SVG defines the className property of its elements as a different String type
[09:45:17] <kinblas> which does not have the standard DOM API on it
[09:45:24] <toddmparker_> awesome
[09:47:52] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I think you referenced the wrong bug in the one you closed
[09:48:07] <kinblas> did you mean 3054 instead of 2836?

[09:50:30] <toddmparker_> those are the 3
[09:50:39] <toddmparker_> maybe they aren't all the same root cause?

[10:27:01] <kinblas> toddmparker_: #3046 and #3054 are *NOT* dups of #2826 .. 2826 is talking about a *DIFFERENT* property ... nodename, not classname
[10:33:05] <toddmparker_> hey kinblas
[10:33:13] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yo
[10:33:16] <toddmparker_> just confirming
[10:33:37] <toddmparker_> we don't allow people to link to a multi-page doc right now
[10:33:46] <toddmparker_> we only pull in the 1st page
[10:33:48] <toddmparker_> right?
[10:34:07] <kinblas> well we do allow them to link, but yes, they will only ever get the 1st page out of it, no matter what hash they give us
[10:37:40] <kinblas> toddmparker_: You saw my comment above about 2826 right?
[10:40:55] <toddmparker_> so you need to use data-ajax = false
[10:41:00] <toddmparker_> we don't doc that well
[10:41:01] <toddmparker_> adding now
[10:41:15] <toddmparker_> i see on 2826
[10:41:22] <toddmparker_> mind commenting and re-opening
[10:41:29] <toddmparker_> kinblas ^
[10:43:46] <toddmparker_> kinblas: did you see this plugin? https://github.com/ToddThomson/jQuery-Mobile-Subpage-Widget
[10:43:48] <kinblas> toddmparker: 2826 is open, but I already fixed the other 2 bugs
[10:43:56] <kinblas> I just tested it and it is indeed a different problem
[10:43:58] <toddmparker_> supposed to allow multi-pages to be loaded in
[10:44:03] <toddmparker_> ok
[10:44:17] <toddmparker_> i was going to link to this from the docs
[10:44:28] <toddmparker_> just wanted to make sure it's not bad
[10:44:44] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I saw mention, but haven't played-with/seen it
[10:44:51] * kinblas has been very heads down lately
[10:45:02] <kinblas> when I look, I get distracted :-P
[10:45:53] <toddmparker_> heh

[10:50:46] <kinblas> so I'm still confused as to how to attend the meeting tomorrow? Do I just run something like google voice and you guys dial me in?
[10:56:59] <sven_franck> hey todd & kinblas
[10:57:11] <sven_franck> found my way in here
[10:59:01] <kinblas> sven_franck!
[10:59:04] <kinblas> welcome!
[10:59:05] <kinblas> :-)
[10:59:21] <kinblas> sven_franck: I haven't had a chance to look at your header/footer fix in detail yet
[10:59:28] <sven_franck> first time on IRC
[10:59:31] <kinblas> been chasing SVG interaction problems
[10:59:47] <sven_franck> no problem, I'm just testing if it really works...
[10:59:56] <kinblas> sven_franck: well we hang out here all day ... what timezone are you in?
[11:00:04] <sven_franck> Germany
[11:00:23] <sven_franck> I will be here another 4-5hrs
[11:00:58] <kinblas> so 9hrs ahead of me, 6 for todd and wilto
[11:01:34] <sven_franck> lot of timezones for a small world :-)
[11:02:17] <kinblas> sven_franck: you are @frequent on github right?
[11:02:22] <sven_franck> correct
[11:02:35] <sven_franck> I need to update my multiview repo...
[11:02:54] <kinblas> heh, I need to look at that too ... sorry, it's been tough the last few weeks
[11:02:56] <sven_franck> sitting on pageContainer CSS and still wondering about containerHistory
[11:03:16] <kinblas> sven_franck: so I had these grand plans back in November 2010
[11:03:22] <kinblas> about decoupling everything
[11:03:41] <kinblas> but then we started trying to get the basics working everywhere
[11:03:48] <kinblas> and I got slightly side-tracked :-)
[11:04:02] <sven_franck> :-)
[11:04:45] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so I guess we need to fix 2826 too?
[11:05:05] <sven_franck> first things first I guess
[11:05:41] <kinblas> sven_franck: I'm thinking we'll be a bit more focused on the release until Thursday
[11:05:51] <kinblas> then we'll have lots of time to talk about multi-view, etc
[11:07:03] <kinblas> sven_franck: I only glanced at your proposed fix for the footer stuff as I was trying to catch up on email this morning. Is that something you are hoping for in 1.0?
[11:07:39] * kinblas notes he didn't read the whole bug, just sven_franck's comments via email
[11:07:59] <sven_franck> not top priority for me
[11:08:20] <sven_franck> stumbled upon it when working on fixed-elements, which kept jumping up
[11:09:08] <sven_franck> I will try to clean up my plugin and upgrade my (slightly) modifed JQM version to 1.0. Then I could give a short guided tour...
[11:09:30] <kinblas> sven_franck: that would be great!
[11:09:50] <sven_franck> good. I would have one quesiton... rather dumb but I cannot get it to go
[11:10:17] <sven_franck> then I could remove a junk of my plugin from JQM
[11:12:12] <sven_franck> I need to "bind" to _handleHashChange firing or call a function in my plugin from inside _handleHashChange to activate containerHistory routine.
[11:13:07] <kinblas> sven_franck: we had talked in the past of exposing our global handlers like the one for click and hashchange, etc, on the $.mobile namespace
[11:13:14] <sven_franck> I can block preventDefault JQM inside _handleHashChange, but I cannot get my container history to fire... :-(
[11:13:51] <kinblas> sven_fanck: So does your plugin have a formal notion of a page container?
[11:13:53] <sven_franck> hm
[11:14:53] <kinblas> sven_franck: what is it that you are trying to do in the handleHashChange that you can't do in your own hashchange listener?
[11:16:14] <sven_franck> 1sec
[11:17:14] <sven_franck> ... I tried to bind to hashChange from my plugin, but I only wanted the "backwards transitions", which worked nicely if I put my logic inside _mobileHashChange.
[11:18:33] <sven_franck> what I'm trying to do is checking panel-history stacks on backwards transitions. If all stacks are even at setup, JQM does a backward transition, if one stack is higher then setup, I do a panel-backwards transition.
[11:18:57] <sven_franck> even at setup = stack level = 1 = first page in panel/container
[11:19:59] <Wilto> Whatup, sven_franck.

[11:23:39] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so much for RC3 being final :-P
[11:23:53] <Wilto> Semi-final.

[11:26:17] <toddmparker_> kk
[11:30:46] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: you around?
[11:30:55] <eddiemonge> im around somewhere
[11:31:09] <sven_franck> kinblas: you already made my day...
[11:31:28] <sven_franck> bound to 'hashChange'...
[11:31:35] <sven_franck> :-D
[11:32:02] <kinblas> sven_franck: so that works for you?
[11:32:07] <sven_franck> here is the link: http://www.stokkers.mobi/valuables/multiview/page2.html
[11:32:09] <sven_franck> check on Firebug when clicking around
[11:32:10] <sven_franck> yup
[11:32:24] <toddmparker_> cool. see yo should hang out here more often sven_franck
[11:32:41] <sven_franck> yeah. improves my spelling big time...
[11:32:50] <toddmparker_> so eddiemonge - i'm not in the mood to mess with getting setup to load files into the server today
[11:32:55] <kinblas> sven_franck: so like I said earlier I wanted to decouple things and have things communicate via events ... makes it easier to extend and get rid of things folks don't need without breaking the whole system
[11:33:00] <toddmparker_> could you upload a directory for me?
[11:33:08] <eddiemonge> sure
[11:33:29] <eddiemonge> got a link or email me?
[11:33:39] <sven_franck> kinblas: that would be nice. But JQM is now already structured that way, isn't it?
[11:34:15] <kinblas> sven_franck: it still has some refactoring to do ... I started it with the navigation stuff, but we have a ways to go
[11:34:48] <kinblas> I should send you the module flow that was in my head back in Nov 2010
[11:34:56] <kinblas> I have PNG somewhere
[11:34:58] <sven_franck> please do.
[11:35:06] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: http://users.cscs.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/JQM/JQMResources/JQMResources_for_Todd.zip
[11:35:38] <kinblas> anyways the big thought was to have a pageContainer widget that managed it's own pages, and you could manage a stack in each one  or delegate it upwards ... in my scheme the pageContainers could nest
[11:35:47] <toddmparker_> if you unzip that, you'll see a few folders. you can just put those in a single folder called "resource-assets"
[11:35:49] <toddmparker_> or whatever
[11:35:57] <toddmparker_> skip the html pages
[11:36:11] <toddmparker_> i'll update things to point to the right place once it's up
[11:37:31] <toddmparker_> hey sven_franck - interested in being on the team call on thursday
[11:37:42] <toddmparker_> if so, give you your skype name
[11:37:46] <sven_franck> depends on the time :-)

[12:27:51] <eddiemonge> for instance http://jquerymobile.com/resource-assets/proto.png
[12:28:37] <toddmparker_> thanks!
[12:28:46] <toddmparker_> so there aren't sub-folders
[12:29:08] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge ^
[12:30:34] <eddiemonge> i copied whatever was in the zip to that folder as is without the html files

[12:31:20] <Wilto> eddiemonge, danheberden: ↑
[12:31:38] <toddmparker_> oh, ok
[12:31:40] <toddmparker_> thanks
[12:31:59] <eddiemonge> i also made a change on the site that i dont know if you noticed yet either
[12:32:04] <toddmparker_> so on Wilto's comment
[12:32:15] <toddmparker_> latest is 5 days out of sync
[12:32:35] <toddmparker_> causing issues when trying to track down a theming issue
[12:32:45] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: can you take a look at latest?
[12:39:51] <eddiemonge> hmm this is very weird
[12:47:28] <Wilto> ’Sup?
[12:50:11] <eddiemonge> hmm so the scripts work as expected but there was a folder on the server that was owned by root that couldnt be deleted so it was choking
[12:50:24] <eddiemonge> removed and now its fixed
[12:51:07] <eddiemonge> im going to see if i can add in some email notifications for when things fail
[12:53:11] <kinblas> toddmparker_: bender's here next to me
[12:56:52] <toddmparker_> oooh
[12:56:58] <toddmparker_> co-coding?
[12:57:01] <toddmparker_> so agile
[12:58:53] <eddiemonge> each with one hand typing on the same keyboard?
[13:13:32] <toddmparker_> i think so
[13:13:49] <toddmparker_> kinblas and johnbender - what are you guys up to?
[13:15:39] <kinblas> toddmparker_: we're in a meeting
[13:18:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Q5WGxQ
[13:18:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed left/right border on swatch F for the docs to prevent horizontal scrolling. Fixes #3045 - toddparker
[13:18:52] <toddmparker_> ah, ok.
[13:43:00] <sven_franck> ... havoc... mh. need to try this again with a clear head...
[13:51:18] <eddiemonge> everyone knows how to use email filters right?
[13:57:25] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: if you can keep the noise to a minimum, that would be ideal
[13:58:33] <Wilto> I wouldn’t mind getting an “EVERYTHING IS RUINED FOREVER” email in the event that something is busted, but we should probably omit the successful ones.
[14:03:22] <eddiemonge> hmm maybe ill just change it so it emails me then since i can only filter for specific errors at the moment
[14:04:01] <toddmparker_> ok
[14:04:04] <toddmparker_> sounds good

[14:29:47] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: is latest not in sync again?
[14:30:23] <eddiemonge> let me check
[14:31:58] <eddiemonge> im seeing it was updated about 10 minutes ago
[14:33:24] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3053
[14:33:25] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3053 on jquery-mobile, reported by epsd (6h, 28m ago): RC3- data-theme doesn't work on data-role=content
[14:33:31] <toddmparker_> ok thanks eddiemonge
[14:38:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/dYQt5Q
[14:38:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #3053 — I was a little overzealous in ensuring “content” elements didn’t inherit a theme if it wasn’t intended. - Mat Marquis
[14:39:17] <Wilto> My B.
[14:46:04] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: can we add a timestamp to the top of the latest css and js files so we can easily check if they are in sync?
[14:47:32] <eddiemonge> the min ones?
[15:02:24] <toddmparker_> yeah, guess so
[15:02:35] <toddmparker_> and non min
[15:02:40] <toddmparker_> so eddie q for ya
[15:02:55] <toddmparker_> i linked up those images and things looked good until i published
[15:02:56] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/resources2/
[15:03:02] <eddiemonge> the non-mins have the git timestamp on them
[15:03:03] <toddmparker_> now images are broken
[15:03:11] <toddmparker_> ah, good to know
[15:03:15] <toddmparker_> i can just check that
[15:03:30] <eddiemonge> you need to add a / to the beginning of the source
[15:03:41] <eddiemonge> otherwise its trying to look in resources2/...
[15:05:11] <toddmparker_> ah, gatcha
[15:05:27] <eddiemonge> i can update that post real quick for you
[15:06:17] <toddmparker_> it's ok
[15:06:20] <toddmparker_> doing it now
[15:06:25] <toddmparker_> just did a quick global
[15:07:26] <toddmparker_> all set now eddiemonge
