[00:47:58] <agcolom> johnbender: gseguin: in the new api docs, I need to document the event for each widget and add the type. Here is an example of how this is done in ui: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/4592d46f5821044af56d12d53d03d08abe250555/entries/accordion.xml#L93-111 (see the activate event for the accordion widget has the type accordionactivate (widget name as prefix followed by event name, unl
[00:47:58] <agcolom> ess these are identical). Do we follow the same rule for mobile? Thank you...
[01:11:56] <johnbender> agcolom: I'll have to take a look tomorrow
[01:11:59] <johnbender> I need some sleep
[01:12:01] <johnbender> :D
[01:14:22] <agcolom> johnbender: OMG, I didn't expect you to still be up!!!! There's no rush at all.... Goodnight :D
[05:45:49] <gseguin> agcolom: we do follow the same rule in some widgets not in others
[05:46:19] <gseguin> everywhere where we use _trigger method that will namespace the event
[05:47:05] <agcolom> ok so with _trigger we use the same namespace rules as jquery UI?
[05:47:34] <agcolom> gseguin: ^ and if we use trigger what is the rule?
[05:49:50] <gseguin> none, and I think we may have to fix that
[05:54:06] <agcolom> gseguin: ok, so it is better if I wait for those or not use prefix for them for now?
[05:54:42] <agcolom> btw, what time is it for you????
[05:55:50] <gseguin> it's 6:55
[05:56:48] <gseguin> you can probably do it for page and listviewfilter
[05:57:15] <agcolom> that's a bit early! Will you go on holiday? (mind you I was up at 4am to watch Venus and Mercury! But then I went back to bed!!!
[05:58:17] <gseguin> about to leave for work
[05:58:40] <gseguin> yeah vacation in 2 weeks in Yosemite
[05:58:46] <agcolom> Have a great day :-) a +
[05:58:53] <agcolom> et merci ;-)
[05:59:15] <agcolom> vacation sounds great!
[05:59:29] <agcolom> and well deserved!
[07:31:26] <gseguin> mornin'
[07:39:58] <Wilto> Hey guys.
[07:45:27] <gseguin> hey Wilto, any popup issue I can help with?
[07:55:28] <Wilto> gseguin: You wanna look into the crashy Android issue?
[07:55:41] <gseguin> which version does it crash on?
[07:55:42] <Wilto> Did _|Nix|_ catch you up on that?
[07:55:46] <gseguin> I only have a JB
[07:56:02] <gseguin> nope
[07:59:20] <uGoMobi> hi guys
[07:59:54] <uGoMobi> maybe we can spend today meeting on the popup issues
[08:00:10] <uGoMobi> Wilto are you able to join?
[08:11:59] <gseguin> gnarf: ping
[08:19:50] * _|Nix|_ tuning in ...
[08:22:26] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: If you create an Android 4.0 AVD in the emulator it will have the problem.
[08:22:42] <_|Nix|_> Incredibly, it crashes even with a single screen.
[08:23:02] <gseguin> so how do you make it crash exactly?
[08:23:13] <gseguin> sorry I haven't followed that thread
[08:23:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Open any popup. Click outside the popup.
[08:23:30] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I've fixed it on master.
[08:23:34] <gseguin> with the code currently on master?
[08:23:44] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: But the fix may have negative side-effects.
[08:23:52] <gseguin> oh ok so what is there to test?
[08:24:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: f2a50a111f5bde8a2bad769f280edd9993ae863f
[08:24:07] <toddmparker_> morning all
[08:24:23] <toddmparker_> i can't stay on, but I made a Google doc for you all to use in today's meeting
[08:24:25] <toddmparker_> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X43scwvTc3CPfs_ivmIUfrOOep9HALmDvz0jOA8iTpk/edit#
[08:24:48] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You can also test branch one-overlay-for-all-popups
[08:24:55] <toddmparker_> if the channel is moderated, gnarf or danheberden or DaveMethvin or ajpiano can unmoderate it for you
[08:25:22] <toddmparker_> Wilto will keep helping out on those bugs today too _|Nix|_
[08:25:28] <gseguin> k toddmparker_
[08:25:34] <toddmparker_> if you need help from gseguin or johnbender - please ask
[08:25:55] <toddmparker_> off to the zoo, i'll check in later
[08:26:17] <gseguin> enjoy your day with your family
[08:32:44] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Have fun!
[08:33:37] <toddmparker_> thanks guys!
[08:33:54] <toddmparker_> good to know i leave everything is very capable hands :)
[08:35:19] <uGoMobi> congrats with your son's birthday toddmparker_ and enjoy the zoo :)
[08:36:10] <_|Nix|_> Indeed! Happy Birthday!
[08:38:52] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: testing the one-overlay-for-all-popups on Android JB and iOS 5.1.1
[08:40:53] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Should be fine, but it will hand on Android 4.0 ... mysteriously ...
[08:41:00] <_|Nix|_> s/hand/hang/
[08:41:31] <gseguin> let me get my android VM up
[08:45:21] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I dunno ... on my Nokia Lumia 800, when I comment out the hide-the-screen-code and dismiss the popup, it scrolls off to never-neverland, but then it scrolls back to where the popup was. So, yeah, it ends up in the correct place, but the visual effect is just as bad as if it hadn't.
[08:45:58] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So, essentially, it implements what I did on the fix-4784 branch.
[08:47:31] <gseguin> ?tell gnarf: We need to get started on the node server for the jQM download builder as Joyent is retiring their no.de machines
[08:47:32] <bot-t> gseguin, Okay.
[08:58:07] <jzaefferer> johnbender: wanna join #jquery-meeting for the QUnit/CI meeting?
[09:01:52] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: OK ... if I hide the screen 5 seconds later, it works flawlessly :)
[09:03:32] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Yessir; I’ll be there.
[09:21:47] <Wilto> —Wait, are we meeting now?
[09:22:41] <uGoMobi> Wilto, no in 1.5 hours... 2pm for you if I am not mistaken
[09:23:36] <Wilto> Ah, just checkin’. Saw johnbender’s name pop up in #jquery-meeting
[09:24:59] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: He's doing the testing meeting.
[09:26:46] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: When you did the don't-hide-the-screen hack and found it not to jump, you haven't been able to click on a second popup without a refresh because, well, the screen was still covering it all, right?
[09:27:23] <Wilto> Yeah. Mind you, I was seeing the jump consistently the first time on WP7.5.
[09:27:28] <Wilto> Might be two different deals.
[09:27:58] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: OK, because I added some code that removes the screen when you click on it a second time. Guess what happens when you then go on to another popup?
[09:28:17] <Wilto> It flips out?
[09:28:28] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: It goes back to where the first popup used to be.
[09:28:34] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: IOW, same old, same old.
[09:29:02] <Wilto> Man what.
[09:29:30] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Welcome to the Twilight Zone ...
[09:47:08] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Both the stale focus and the scrolling is all about the history. If I $.mobile.hashListeningEnabled = false; $.mobile.pushStateEnabled = false; $.mobile.changePage.defaults.changeHash = false; it works flawlessly.
[09:47:28] <Wilto> Well THAT’S interesting.
[09:47:45] <johnbender> Wilto: is todd joining us today?
[09:47:53] <johnbender> I'm under the impression he's out
[09:47:53] <Wilto> johnbender: Don’t think so, no.
[09:47:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: No.
[09:47:56] <johnbender> k
[09:48:05] <johnbender> we'll keep it real short then :O
[09:48:17] <Wilto> He’s off cruising around on his boat, lighting cigars with $100 bills. Y’know, boss stuff.
[09:48:46] <Wilto> See: http://bukk.it/onepercent.jpg
[09:49:18] <Wilto> johnbender: Yeah, I just wanna regroup on these popup shenanigans. But if we can work around both with a little history tweaking…
[09:49:40] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Did you try gettin’ hacky with how the history updates yet?
[09:49:59] <johnbender> Wilto: _|Nix|_: we can do a hangout after the meeting to get into technical stuff if you want
[09:50:09] <_|Nix|_> Definitely.
[09:50:29] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Dunno what you mean ...
[09:50:44] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: If I need to have "Back" button support, it's all over.
[09:51:15] <johnbender> Wilto: _|Nix|_: yah I thought we "Nix'd" that
[09:51:19] <johnbender> pun fully intended
[09:51:22] <Wilto> Ba-dum tss!
[09:51:27] <johnbender> Wilto: hell yah
[09:51:29] <_|Nix|_> *shake head* ...
[09:51:36] * johnbender fist pumps
[09:51:42] <johnbender> oh wait
[09:51:49] <johnbender> that wasn't House music?
[09:51:53] <johnbender> it was a rimshot
[09:52:02] * johnbender continues fist pumping
[09:52:04] * johnbender doesn't care
[09:52:52] <Wilto> untz untz untz
[09:53:01] <_|Nix|_> The thing is ... the changePage logic probably takes care of all this. I replicated some of that logic inside popup. Aaaand there's the problem.
[09:53:08] <Wilto> Ahh.
[09:53:35] <Wilto> Honestly, I’m of the mind that I’d rather lop troublesome parts of popup off for now and revisit them later as future enhancements.
[09:53:36] <_|Nix|_> However, the alternative is to fully integrate popups with the changePage logic, from click routing to transition.
[09:54:08] <Wilto> Hm.
[09:54:10] <_|Nix|_> ... which means that navigation depends on popup.
[09:54:27] <_|Nix|_> IOW, the alternatives are unthinkable.
[09:54:37] <_|Nix|_> 1962, anyone?
[09:54:55] <Wilto> …You sure we couldn’t just slap a setTimeout on the reproduced nav logic in popup?
[09:55:00] <Wilto> Just to see what happenes.
[09:55:02] <Wilto> …happens.
[09:55:37] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: You mean ... the popup has fully appeared on screen, and some time later it does the whole hashchange?
[09:55:47] <Wilto> Like, a split second later.
[09:56:14] <Wilto> I’m wondering if having all manner of things kicking off at once is what’s causing the flakiness.
[09:56:49] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Well, actually, it waits for the hashchange caused by the path.set() before it starts running the animations.
[09:57:04] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: The only things that are concurrent are the animation of the screen and the container.
[09:57:39] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: The hashchange resulting from having appended the dialogHashKey is a prerequisite for kicking off the CSS transitions.
[09:58:14] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: But, we can flip that upside down, I suppose. Have the completion of the CSS animations be the prerequisite for the history addition.
[09:59:02] <_|Nix|_> *gulp* ... non-trivial though, I suspect.
[10:00:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: Wilto: after the meeting I'll dive in on this
[10:00:59] <johnbender> try to help
[10:01:16] <Wilto> Sweet.
[10:01:26] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[10:02:12] <Wilto> IRC meeting now, yeah?
[10:02:14] <gnarf> gseguin: you gonna be around tomorrow? and whats our timeframe?
[10:02:20] <_|Nix|_> Now?
[10:02:21] <Wilto> I can unmute it.
[10:02:37] <_|Nix|_> Did you guys change daylight savings again, or something?
[10:03:09] <Wilto> Oh, no. I didn’t know if the IRC thing came first and the G+ meeting was at 2:00EDT or what.
[10:03:11] <Wilto> Been a while.
[10:03:53] <Wilto> So “I have time to go get a sandwich,” is what I’m getting at.
[10:03:59] <Wilto> #professionalism
[10:04:03] <_|Nix|_> Indeed ...
[10:04:17] <gseguin> gnarf: tomorrow doesn't work for me
[10:04:47] <Wilto> My dedication to jQM is matched only by my dedication to bánh mì.
[10:04:50] <gnarf> gseguin: today doesn't work for me - next opening? :)
[10:06:31] <johnbender> Wilto: _|Nix|_ did we move the thursday meeting back?
[10:06:41] <johnbender> or has it always been at 11?
[10:06:48] <johnbender> hasn't it always been at 11?
[10:06:55] * johnbender feels like he is taking crazy pills
[10:07:27] <Wilto> I’m in the same boat, johnbender. With my iCal fried, all hope is lost.
[10:07:52] <johnbender> 11 it is
[10:07:53] <johnbender> :)
[10:19:24] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: The scroll happens in response to the hashchange.
[10:19:55] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I delayed the return from the dialogHashChange state to the normal page state, and with that, the scrolling was delayed too.
[10:22:10] <Wilto> Hm.
[10:22:42] <Wilto> I might vote we just raze the history for now.
[10:24:04] <_|Nix|_> ...4~]k
[10:24:24] <_|Nix|_> All because of Windoze?
[10:25:17] <Wilto> You said it helped with the Android issue too, yeah?
[10:26:15] <_|Nix|_> Nono ... Android has no history-related issues.
[10:26:39] <_|Nix|_> On Android it's the other side of the coin - the DOM.
[10:27:29] <_|Nix|_> Specifically, for some incomprehensible reason, I can't hook up a "vclick" handler to the screen. I must let the event from the screen bubble up to the document, and catch it there.
[10:28:17] <_|Nix|_> ... and that's Android 4.0 only - and only some devices.
[10:29:30] <Wilto> “THE DOM,” he said, shaking a fist at the sky.
[10:30:14] <Wilto> I still can’t wrap my head around that issue.
[10:30:20] <Wilto> Especially given the single backdrop element.
[10:30:25] <Wilto> Friggin’ baffling.
[10:32:10] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Yeah. I added a console.log() to jQuery's trigger() - the one with all the parameters, not the one you call from the outside, and got this: https://gist.github.com/3371893
[10:32:38] <Wilto> Woah.
[10:32:42] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: It seems like it's hanging inside the native code, because there sure as hell are no events during the wait.
[10:36:37] <_|Nix|_> Thought we should probably change the code in master to always bind to the screen /unless/ it's Android 4.0. Currently it only binds to the screen when it's IE, because that's the only one that absolutely doesn't work otherwise.
[10:36:43] <_|Nix|_> s/Thought/Though/
[10:38:18] <Wilto> Eeeeh…
[10:38:36] <_|Nix|_> ... but that involves copying some of the real awesome ua-recognition code from fixedToolbar ...
[10:38:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: could the WP issue have to do with the fake onhashchange we use for IE?
[10:38:43] <Wilto> This is weak sauce, though. There has to be some reason this is happening.
[10:38:54] <Wilto> It’s not like trigger() always hangs on Android 4.0.
[10:39:09] <uGoMobi> that includes inserting a hidden iframe after the body
[10:39:15] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Exactly. Agreed. The question is, how long do we tinker with this?
[10:39:26] <Wilto> AS LONG AS IT TAKES. I just like saying that.
[10:40:20] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: You're right. We should figger out why vclick hangs /under this exact set of circumstances/ ...
[10:40:53] <Wilto> Here’s the thing: I tried just binding the vclick to the backdrop’s class, and it was okay.
[10:40:59] <Wilto> Like “go find it in the DOM again”-style.
[10:41:22] <_|Nix|_> jaw@floor.
[10:41:29] <Wilto> Not a solution really, but it’s gotta mean something.
[10:41:38] <_|Nix|_> Wow!
[10:41:42] <Wilto> It’s like the reference to the element is screwed up. I don’t know, man; it’s bizarre.
[10:41:58] <Wilto> It reads as a particularly scary kind of bug, the more I dig into it.
[10:42:05] <Wilto> Like JavaScript-engine-bug.
[10:44:28] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I wonder what if you did $( this._ui.screen[0] ).bind( ...
[10:44:47] <Wilto> Tried it; nada.
[10:45:12] <Wilto> I think, anyway; I can re-check.
[10:45:35] <Wilto> I know I basically ran through like every possible method of taking that thing and binding a thing to it; I’m fairly certain that was one.
[10:45:44] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Does kinda make sense ... I wonder what this._ui.screen[0] === $( ".ui-popup-screen" )[0] gives ...
[10:47:39] <Wilto> The phone probably just bursts into flames.
[10:53:24] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: The funny thing is that I don't do any weird DOM-things with the screen in the main branch - in the one-overlay-for-all-popups branch I must insert it into the current page before I can show it, because it may be in some other, now-invisible page.

[11:03:43] <Wilto> Aw man, I wanted to do it.

[12:07:52] <gseguin> johnbender: I haven't been lucky at finding issues with popup
[12:07:59] <johnbender> :/
[12:08:07] <johnbender> yah I checked all my devices yesterday and neither did I
[12:08:11] <gseguin> works for me
[12:08:34] <johnbender> I even updated from playbook 1 to 2 and check that :P
[12:15:42] <_|Nix|_> I recommend you fire up an Android 4.0 VM and check out one-overlay-for-all-popups. Then, invoke a popup and click outside it.
[12:15:49] <_|Nix|_> Mayhem ensues.
[12:17:37] * gseguin goes to do just that
[12:17:48] <_|Nix|_> I have the following settings in my Android SDK manager: Target name: Android 4.0, Platform: 4.0, API Level 14, CPU/ABI ARM(armeabi-v7a)
[12:19:03] <_|Nix|_> Dunno what Wilto's been seeing in terms of not getting the hangage when you re-query the DOM ... I get the hangage just the same.
[12:25:10] <johnbender> off to the gym
[12:25:12] <johnbender> bbl
[12:32:07] <_|Nix|_> I think we have to generate the screen div on the fly, at open time for it not to crash ... testing that hypothesis now.

[12:42:37] * gseguin boots up the 4.0 image
[12:55:57] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Sorry, checked out for a while there. Gonna keep going on the WP issue.
[12:58:01] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: OK, then I'll take the Android issue.
[12:58:06] <Wilto> ENJOY!
[12:58:13] <_|Nix|_> You too ...
[12:58:26] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/high-five.gif
[13:11:32] <gseguin> I got side tracked by the handwriting thing on www.google.com
[13:11:48] <Wilto> DAMMIT, GOOGLE.COM
[13:13:57] <_|Nix|_> Backstabbing the competition ... tsk tsk ...
[13:14:31] <gseguin> oh yeah! it's hanging
[13:15:03] <_|Nix|_> Well, slap me around and call me Suzy. It doesn't hang if I generate the screen on-the-fly and attach it to the body, rather than the page.
[13:15:21] <_|Nix|_> Of course, if I attach it to the body, the width: 100%, height: 100% isn't going to work so well.
[13:17:48] <gseguin> by on-the-fly you mean creating it at opening?
[13:17:57] <gseguin> not at widget creation?
[13:19:01] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: At opening, yes.
[13:19:08] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... and you must attach to the body.
[13:19:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... but I'm checking if attaching to the body is enough.
[13:19:49] <gseguin> ok
[13:24:06] <_|Nix|_> Attaching to the body is enough to prevent hangage.
[13:24:31] <gseguin> wow!
[13:27:08] <_|Nix|_> That's great 'n all, but how do we go forward then? Do we attach to the body and size things by hand?
[13:27:57] <_|Nix|_> We've had code that would size the screen by hand before.
[13:29:57] <gseguin> not sure I understand why 100% doesn't work
[13:31:34] <_|Nix|_> width: 100% or height: 100% means 100% of the parent.
[13:31:48] <gseguin> right
[13:31:53] <_|Nix|_> However, Wilto informs us that 100% of body === 100% of html === 100% of window.
[13:32:07] <Wilto> If position: absolute!
[13:32:14] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Yes, sorry!
[13:32:28] <_|Nix|_> So, our screen will be the size of the window.
[13:32:33] <gseguin> oh I see
[13:32:38] <_|Nix|_> ... and if you pan, you will find its edge.
[13:32:38] <Wilto> http://wtfmbta.com/
[13:32:50] <Wilto> That’s how I keep everything viewport-sized on ^
[13:34:59] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: OK, but we have scrollbars, right? That page is designed to accomodate the browser window and no more, right?
[13:35:44] <Wilto> Yeah.
[13:39:03] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So, unless I missed something, we can't use that. We still need to stretch the screen by hand.
[13:39:25] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, yeah. I forget why we were talking about it.
[13:39:51] <Wilto> —Wait. If you generate it on the fly but put it in the page, it does the same thing?
[13:40:59] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: If I put it in the page, it hangs when I click on it.
[13:41:07] <Wilto> what
[13:41:14] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: On-the-fly or otherwise.
[13:41:20] <Wilto> Oh, C’MON ANDROID.
[13:41:23] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Yeah - not a stale pointer either.
[13:41:24] <Wilto> Wait wait wait.
[13:41:31] <Wilto> _Why_?
[13:41:41] <Wilto> What about the page could possible cause that?
[13:42:08] <_|Nix|_> Beats the hell outta me ...
[13:42:20] <Wilto> There is only one course of action, i say.
[13:42:25] <Wilto> Burn that sucker down.
[13:42:46] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: You mean the Googleplex?
[13:42:52] <_|Nix|_> WORKSFORME.
[13:42:59] <Wilto> If you put it in a div outside (maybe) the page and just inside the body, does it do the same?
[13:43:14] <Wilto> A div with a class of ui-page? Is something bound to the page that could cause that? I dunno, man.
[13:43:21] <Wilto> There has to be something about the page causing it.
[13:43:55] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Absolutely, but I can't put it in a div because then it's gonna have 0 height.
[13:47:49] <gseguin> _|Nix|_ and the overlay needs to be the viewport size, right?
[13:47:53] <Wilto> What if it gets all ui-page’s styles, just to see what happens?
[13:48:02] <Wilto> I more just wanna figure out why this is happening.
[13:48:38] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Should I copy the classes from $.mobile.activePage over to my screen?
[13:49:08] <gseguin> I agree, understanding what is going on will lead to a better fix
[13:49:19] <Wilto> I dunno; I’m just thinking we experiment with this sucker.
[13:49:38] <Wilto> Drop it into a div with all ui-page’s styles; maybe it’s something with that. More likely it’s something bound to ui-page.
[13:51:20] <Wilto> I mean, whatever is causing it to hang on Android 4.blah is likely an issue in other places—just, most other things handle issues better than Android.
[13:57:47] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So, I've wrapped things as you suggested, but now how do I click on the screen. It's not visible.
[13:57:51] <_|Nix|_> ?
[14:06:00] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: If I wrap in a div as you suggested, it does not crash.
[14:06:01] <Wilto> hjdahfjklanwejkcWINDOWS PHOOONE
[14:06:39] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Did you re-add all the ui-page styles to it?
[14:06:57] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Yes, and an additional display: block, because otherwise it's not visible.
[14:07:06] <Wilto> That’d rule out any weird styling shenanigans, not that it’s terribly likely. More likely something bound to the page.
[14:07:09] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I added the display: block on open, and remove it on close.
[14:07:15] <Wilto> Gotcha.
[14:07:42] <Wilto> So something is like… bubbling up to the page and screwing everything up.
[14:08:29] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Well, it's not anything that goes through jQuery, because I put a console.log there earlier, remember, and all I got was one long silence ...
[14:08:42] <Wilto> Surely we have very little bound to the page element!
[14:09:04] <Wilto> But we know that trigger() doesn’t cause that issue normally on 4.0.
[14:09:15] <Wilto> There has to be something on page that’s causing the weirdness, yeah?
[14:10:06] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: That's a needle in a haystack. The question is, can we tackle a haystack that size?
[14:10:54] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: The worst part is you don't have dev tools ... gotta do everything via refresh and some cleverly placed code.
[14:11:09] <Wilto> Oh, it’s a festival of “alerts” over here.
[14:11:34] <_|Nix|_> They keep you alert.
[14:12:06] <Wilto> I need it.
[14:14:06] <_|Nix|_> Well, I think I'm'a leave it at this. It's getting awfully Friday here. I shall resume this quest come daybreak (or thereabouts). L8R d00dz!
[14:15:02] <Wilto> Later on, man.
[14:21:38] <Wilto> OKAY SCREW IT
[14:21:59] <Wilto> Windows Phone ain’t gettin’ no history on popups.
