[07:05:08] <toddparker> morning all
[07:06:21] <Dragooon> Evening
[07:08:14] <toddparker> where are you Dragooon
[07:08:18] <Dragooon> India
[07:08:23] <toddparker> ah, cool
[07:17:38] <imjoshdean> morning todd
[07:20:43] <toddparker> hey imjoshdean
[07:25:01] <toddparker> john bender or gseguin - when you get in we need to see why /test/ is looking off
[07:25:03] <toddparker> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/docs/forms/forms-all.html
[07:25:18] <toddparker> ^^ all the grouped buttons, aren't
[07:25:36] <toddparker> but i just did a fresh pull on master and it looks fine locally so it must be a build issue
[07:26:53] <toddparker> hey imjoshdean - did you see the comment on your button commit?
[07:26:54] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a23f0d3a0e0512b4bfcb9aa01b51e5eb39259cf3#commitcomment-885550
[07:26:55] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (22h, 6m ago): Update to buttonMarkup to use appropriate data selector
[07:27:04] <imjoshdean> toddparker: I did not
[07:27:15] <toddparker> good I ping'd you then :)
[07:27:23] <imjoshdean> ah, yes
[07:27:47] <imjoshdean> i'm using el, because I want to use the jquery object to check the jqmdata role
[07:28:10] <imjoshdean> before I was doing e.getAttribute('data-role') but the unit testing proved that that was a neddy no no
[07:29:28] <imjoshdean> I'm glad ninichki logged in for the first time in 6 months to ask me that.
[07:29:44] <toddparker> heh
[07:30:04] <toddparker> just checking your work sir
[07:30:11] <toddparker> do you know who that is?
[07:30:14] <imjoshdean> Not a clue
[07:30:17] <imjoshdean> I'll leave a comment
[07:31:52] <imjoshdean> Glad s/he did ask, because maybe they'll realize the same mistake I made, that you CAN assume "data-role"
[07:35:35] <toddparker> right
[07:36:26] <imjoshdean> Anyway, thanks for bringing it to my attention, I never got an email or notification for it
[07:42:04] <toddparker> that's odd, but maybe because gseguin pulled it in? seems like it should be smarter about that
[07:42:11] <toddparker> thanks for the help
[07:42:28] <toddparker> you going to be helping out around these parts now?
[07:44:42] <imjoshdean> toddparker: I'd like to, yeah
[07:45:11] <toddparker> cool
[07:45:24] <toddparker> appreciate the help for sure
[07:45:49] <toddparker> if there are any 1.0.1 milestone issues that looks fixable that would eb the best thing to look at
[07:46:11] <imjoshdean> definitely
[07:46:29] <imjoshdean> I'll take a look when I can. I'm, technically, at work right now
[07:47:41] <toddparker> aren't we all? :
[07:47:42] <toddparker> ;)
[07:50:17] <imjoshdean> haha, well most of us
[07:53:00] <imjoshdean> Either way, I'll help out however I can, I don't really have much in the way of test devices
[07:53:03] <imjoshdean> just me and my iPhone.
[07:59:08] <toddparker> sure
[07:59:17] <toddparker> some are more logic/JS issues anyway
[08:11:50] <toddparker> morning kinblas
[08:12:39] <kinblas> toddparker: mornin'
[08:13:25] <toddparker> how goes it?
[08:13:34] <toddparker> oh, did you receive a playbook?
[08:13:39] <toddparker> mine arrived 2 days ago
[08:14:03] <toddparker> can't get it to connect to the server to agree to the EULA, but hey
[08:15:23] <kinblas_> toddparker: haven't received anything yet ... sometimes takes the mail-room a while to distribute
[08:16:04] <toddparker> might be worth checking on that if it doesn't show today
[08:21:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to zoom: http://git.io/kiE4xg
[08:21:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/zoom] updated to use only the devicemotion event, for compatibility and less battery battering - scottjehl
[08:21:44] <kinblas> toddparker: not sure if you saw my entry in the meeting chat yesterday
[08:21:56] <toddparker> maybe now?
[08:21:58] <toddparker> not
[08:22:04] <kinblas> toddparker: i'll be in seattle mon/tues/wed in meetings all day so I won't be available
[08:22:55] <toddparker> ok, no problem
[08:22:59] <toddparker> thanks for the heads up
[08:23:12] <toddparker> top secret meetings
[08:39:31] <toddparker> kinblas: you around?
[08:39:39] <toddparker> actually anybody
[08:39:46] <toddparker> with an iPad 2
[08:40:10] <toddparker> we're testing the "zoom" branch for scott's orientation change bug fix
[08:40:25] <toddparker> and iPad 1 is being a little flaky, wondering if iPad 2 is the same
[08:41:54] <kinblas> toddparker: I don't have an ipad2 (unfortunately)
[08:43:49] <imjoshdean> I do, but I accidentally left it at home :\
[08:45:06] <toddparker> heh, i don't either
[08:45:08] <toddparker> waiting for 3
[08:45:17] <toddparker> dangit
[08:47:37] <gseguin> good morning
[08:48:03] <gseguin> toddparker: that button problem looks like a dependency problem
[08:48:13] <gseguin> I'll take a look
[08:49:16] <rwaldron> hey dudes
[08:49:29] <rwaldron> dropped in latest master to the client project and demo'ed it for them
[08:49:47] <rwaldron> they LOVE the new toolbar behaviour
[08:50:03] <rwaldron> and they all commented that the UI feels snappier
[08:50:04] <rwaldron> i agree
[08:50:16] <toddparker> cool, great to hear rwaldron
[08:50:31] <toddparker> we still have some cleanup to do, but it is a big improvement
[08:50:34] <gseguin> good to hear rwaldron
[08:50:38] <rwaldron> definitely
[08:50:45] <toddparker> scott is going to land the iOS orientation zoom fix soon too
[08:50:50] <rwaldron> awesome
[08:51:02] <toddparker> and native selects won't zoom in anymore when focused
[08:51:17] <rwaldron> very cool
[08:51:18] <toddparker> 1.1 = todd's pet peeve edition
[08:51:52] <rwaldron> (unrelated to 1.1) one thing that's bizarre... have you ever encountered android refusing to open the keyboard?
[08:52:17] <toddparker> we've heard a few odd things with android's keyboard
[08:52:24] <toddparker> does the input get focus?
[08:52:58] <rwaldron> yeah
[08:53:05] <rwaldron> the cursor is there
[08:53:09] <rwaldron> no keyboard
[08:53:16] <rwaldron> i'm not too worried at the moment
[08:53:26] <rwaldron> i was just wondering if you'd ever seen it
[08:53:27] <toddparker> i hate android. i really do.
[08:53:36] <rwaldron> yeah
[08:53:40] <rwaldron> I had no idea
[08:53:45] <toddparker> how can the company that makes the best browser (chrome) also make the worst (android's)
[08:54:00] <rwaldron> until i started working on this project, last summer
[08:54:08] <toddparker> life will improve if they really do put chrome in android and it's not jet marketing
[08:54:18] <rwaldron> I incorrectly assumed that android webkit wasn't a piece of shit
[08:54:20] <rwaldron> i was wrong
[08:54:21] <toddparker> just, not jet
[08:54:48] <rwaldron> also, it's incredible how different the workflow is
[08:54:56] <rwaldron> android feels like a constant "wtf"
[08:55:24] <toddparker> yup
[08:55:33] <toddparker> you just need to be a hardcore java dev to love it
[08:57:18] <rwaldron> I'll pass
[08:57:22] <rwaldron> :)
[08:57:34] <rwaldron> anyway, thanks again for all the work you guys put into this
[08:58:01] <rwaldron> I couldn't have made this a success without the framework and without the patience of the jQuery Mobile dev team
[08:58:09] <rwaldron> now it's lunch time
[09:04:09] <gseguin> toddparker: so the problem with the controlgroups is that the handler is registered before the ones of the buttons and other controls
[09:04:29] <toddparker> thanks rwaldron
[09:04:40] <toddparker> ah, so it's another sequence issue
[09:04:58] <gseguin> I'm thinking for these components that have a soft dependencies on others
[09:05:09] <toddparker> is that a problem in general gseguin or did the AMD changes make this pop up
[09:05:22] <toddparker> like timing?
[09:05:23] <gseguin> AMD
[09:05:32] <toddparker> gotcha
[09:05:57] <toddparker> i just wonder if there are other issues that have popped up that aren't ad easy to spot
[09:06:05] <gseguin> I think for those components it would be appropriate to move the pagecreate handler to the init
[09:06:09] <toddparker> seems like we have unit tests for this
[09:06:56] <gseguin> because we can't really say that controlgroup has a dep on button
[09:07:15] <gseguin> but it needs to register its pagecreate handler after the button's one
[09:10:03] <gseguin> kinblas: what do you think?
[09:11:33] <gseguin> alright I'll wait for johnbender to weigh in
[09:13:08] <kinblas> gseguin: toddparker: the whole reason we added pageinit was because folks wanted a predictable hook where all was said and done for enhancement ... if we move some of this stuff to pageInit we're back in the same boat we used to be in
[09:13:22] <kinblas> We really need to spend some time re-thinking framework initialization
[09:13:36] <gseguin> sorry I meant jquery.mobile.init
[09:14:08] <gseguin> I didn't mean to have a init handler to register that handler
[09:14:30] <gseguin> do I make sense?
[09:15:01] <kinblas> gseguin:  oh are you talking about registering for initialization?
[09:15:09] <kinblas> that's what I've been thinking
[09:15:17] <gseguin> Just moving the registration of the pagecreate handler to the jquery.mobile.init for controlgroup makes it work: http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/compiled/demos/docs/forms/forms-all.html
[09:15:31] <gseguin> sorry kinblas, I know you can't see those
[09:15:35] <kinblas> components should register with the framework for initialization and as part of the registry have weights to help with ordering
[09:15:53] <kinblas> too bad we don't have access to the old basecamp
[09:15:55] <gseguin> yes that would be ideal
[09:16:04] <kinblas> I had a thread where I laid out how I thought the init should work
[09:16:14] <kinblas> because the mobileinit approach isn't optimal
[09:16:50] <toddparker> bummer we lost that
[09:16:52] <gseguin> but in the meantime moving the pagecreate handler registration is probably the best approach
[09:17:18] <gseguin> and that is just for a handful of widgets
[09:17:45] <johnbender> gnarf: danheberden: did you guys get the mailing list email I sent out last night?
[09:19:24] <toddparker> so what is the downside for that gseguin
[09:20:16] <toddparker> the Q is have is whether this is a wrinke because of AMD or if this would happen with a builder too
[09:20:27] <toddparker> sort of get worried that we keep making changes for AMD
[09:20:34] <johnbender> ^^
[09:21:09] <johnbender> toddparker: looks like we lost the irc cloud folks :(
[09:21:12] <johnbender> toddparker: what's going on?
[09:22:30] <toddparker> with IRC or the conversation?
[09:22:59] <johnbender> toddparker: the conversationi
[09:23:12] <toddparker> did you lose history for this morning? I can try to get you up to speed
[09:23:22] <johnbender> toddparker: I just got online
[09:23:28] * johnbender needs an irc proxy so badly
[09:23:28] <toddparker> so on test grouped widgets aren't grouped, but ok locally:
[09:23:29] <toddparker> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/docs/forms/forms-all.html
[09:23:52] <johnbender> ah I see that
[09:23:54] <gseguin> sorry folks, IRCCloud ...
[09:23:56] <toddparker> gseguin's said "so the problem with the controlgroups is that the handler is registered before the ones of the buttons and other controls"
[09:24:08] <toddparker> (trying to catch johnbender  up)
[09:24:09] <johnbender> so it's a dependency
[09:24:19] <johnbender> this is why we made the docs use AMD!
[09:24:20] <johnbender> YAY!
[09:24:21] <toddparker> timing, yes
[09:24:26] <johnbender> we have an ordering dep
[09:24:33] <johnbender> toddparker: this is not bad
[09:24:35] <johnbender> it's good
[09:24:38] <gseguin> johnbender: soft-dependency in that case though
[09:24:54] <johnbender> gseguin: right, its not a code dependency but a load order dep
[09:25:05] <toddparker> yeah, right?
[09:25:05] <gseguin> yeah so what I was suggesting
[09:25:07] <johnbender> toddparker: we have to find these things or the builder won't work
[09:25:17] <toddparker> that was what i was just asking
[09:25:28] <gseguin> until we implement a better solution like being able to give a weight at registration
[09:25:35] <johnbender> if we don't make sure the built bundle is in the right order or come up with some other solution we'll have problesm
[09:25:37] <gseguin> as mentionned by kinblas
[09:25:50] <johnbender> gseguin: so what exactly is causing the issue
[09:25:56] <johnbender> can we just create an internal event?
[09:26:03] <gseguin> was that we move the pagecreate handler registration of the controlgroups to the jquery.mobile.init IIFE
[09:26:16] <johnbender> ah
[09:26:24] <johnbender> yah that would work
[09:26:45] <johnbender> so what needs to go first?
[09:26:55] <toddparker> any downsides to doing that?
[09:27:09] <johnbender> toddparker: yah it's a quick fix, but with TODO in there we'll know its not long term
[09:27:21] <johnbender> and I think it's in the back of everyone's mind we need a more robust widget registration mechanism
[09:27:22] <gseguin> toddparker: downside is breaking our code pattern
[09:27:32] <gseguin> but in reality there isn't any
[09:27:37] <johnbender> ^
[09:27:40] <johnbender> YAY!
[09:27:42] <johnbender> this makes me happy
[09:27:57] <johnbender> stuff like this makes all the difficulty we've had in using amd with the docs worth it
[09:28:08] <johnbender> because this was the purpose of doing just that!
[09:28:19] * johnbender dances a little jig.
[09:28:38] <gseguin> alright I'll commit what I've done then
[09:28:47] <gseguin> and then move on to Jive tasks
[09:28:54] <johnbender> gseguin: can you send out a quick PSA on basecamp?
[09:28:59] <toddparker> cool. thanks guys
[09:29:00] <johnbender> just want to enter it into the project conciousness
[09:29:09] <gseguin> yes
[09:29:09] <johnbender> we can address it post 1.2 per Todd's plan
[09:29:13] <johnbender> gseguin: thanks man
[09:29:22] <johnbender> gseguin: and thanks for the change to the script loader from last night
[09:29:28] <toddparker> so my other concern is what other widgets have this kind of issue but i guess that's why we're testing like this.
[09:29:38] <toddparker> yeah, thans gseguin
[09:29:50] <gseguin> johnbender: no problem, in that branch jquery.js is no longer needed
[09:30:38] <johnbender> gseguin: for the tests or in general
[09:31:20] <gseguin> accross the that branch
[09:31:41] <gseguin> all files use jquery.tag.inserter.js
[09:31:49] <johnbender> gseguin: including the docs?
[09:32:00] <gseguin> which will point to the versioned stamped jquery file
[09:32:02] <gseguin> yes
[09:32:35] <johnbender> I might revert that
[09:33:16] <danheberden> johnbender i did
[09:33:17] <gseguin> k
[09:33:20] <danheberden> or, we did, rather
[09:37:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/6dV1Vg
[09:37:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Moved the pagecreate handler registration for controlgroups to the init IIFE so it's executed after all required widgets have registered theirs - Ghislain Seguin
[09:37:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Remove unnecessary order! plugins - Ghislain Seguin
[09:38:00] <toddparker> so this should go up to /test/ within a few minutes?
[09:40:53] <johnbender> toddparker: yah it should be building now
[09:41:19] <johnbender> toddparker: eddie was kind enough to sort out some more logging for us instead of the ghetto crap I had in place so we can tell what happens if the build fails now
[09:42:29] <toddparker> nice
[09:42:42] <toddparker> so we won't go days without knowing is test is updated
[09:44:04] <johnbender> toddparker: no that can still happen
[09:44:29] <johnbender> we're floating around some ideas to solve that too
[09:45:05] <johnbender> I had the idea of using jenkins to do builds
[09:45:11] <johnbender> which is what it's mean for
[09:45:20] <johnbender> or was originally meant for
[09:46:27] <gseguin> it's not updating :(
[09:46:44] <toddparker> super
[09:46:50] <johnbender> checking :(
[09:47:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/qgBOOw
[09:47:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed all instances of data-position="inline" in headers - toddparker
[09:54:34] <johnbender> gseguin: it's up on the server is the odd thing
[09:54:38] <johnbender> I'm looking at your changes right now
[09:55:00] <gseguin> the build hasn't happened
[09:55:40] <gseguin> johnbender: curl http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/js/jquery.mobile.docs.js | head
[09:55:55] <gseguin> the SHA1 & date are wrong
[09:56:10] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm on the server
[09:56:12] <johnbender> looking at the file
[09:56:20] <johnbender> let me double check that the path is correct
[09:56:28] <toddparker> ok, thanks
[09:56:30] <johnbender> gseguin: and it has the sha and everythign
[09:56:33] <toddparker> that's bother possibility
[09:56:34] <johnbender> and your updates
[09:56:38] <toddparker> that something is just off
[09:56:40] <johnbender> yep
[09:57:14] <gseguin> johnbender: what's the date on it?
[09:57:23] <johnbender> Fri, jan 20
[09:57:32] <johnbender> 12:46
[09:57:38] <gseguin> well that's weird
[09:57:41] <johnbender> yah
[09:57:42] <johnbender> lol
[09:57:57] <gseguin> did the ftp fail?
[09:57:59] <johnbender> ?
[09:58:04] <johnbender> I'm looking at the file on the cdn server
[09:58:08] <johnbender> it's there
[09:58:12] <gseguin> after building it does an ftp
[09:58:15] <gseguin> doesn't it?
[09:58:20] <johnbender> to the cdn server
[09:58:27] <johnbender> latest scp's the file to the cdn server
[09:58:34] <johnbender> I should say something like "the cdn source"
[09:58:36] * gseguin is not very familiar with this process
[09:58:43] <johnbender> gseguin: it's ok I'm learning too :(
[09:59:12] <gseguin> ok so the file you were looking at is on the cdn source?
[09:59:18] <johnbender> yah
[09:59:25] <johnbender> that's what makes this annoying/weird
[09:59:45] <johnbender> maybe it's not getting propogated to the cdn?
[09:59:51] <gseguin> danheberden was talking about calling something with ?reload
[09:59:55] <johnbender> yep
[09:59:56] <johnbender> we do that
[10:00:01] <johnbender> OH!
[10:00:04] <johnbender> one sec
[10:00:06] <gseguin> can you do it manually?
[10:01:19] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm just  tried
[10:01:21] <johnbender> no dice
[10:01:44] <johnbender> gseguin: well if you do the curl the sha and date are there
[10:01:47] <johnbender> but they are old :
[10:01:48] <johnbender> :(
[10:01:53] <johnbender> is that what you were seeing earlier?
[10:01:56] <johnbender> ahh
[10:01:56] <johnbender> yes
[10:01:57] <johnbender> it was
[10:01:59] <gseguin> yep
[10:02:04] <johnbender> muther trucker
[10:05:05] <johnbender> gseguin: though we don't have a refresh for the docs js
[10:05:10] <johnbender> in the post commit hook
[10:05:23] <gseguin> heh that may be the problem
[10:05:39] <johnbender> well yah but I just did it manually and it did nothing
[10:05:53] <johnbender> I realized that and then tried it manually
[10:05:57] <johnbender> going to add that obviously
[10:06:15] <johnbender> gseguin: this is what I get for not taking the time to understand what you two crazy's cooked up
[10:06:26] <johnbender> jk
[10:07:30] <gseguin> wait
[10:07:42] <gseguin> what's the SHA1 you have on the box?
[10:07:48] <johnbender> gseguin: figured it out
[10:07:52] <johnbender> I think we need to configure the cdn
[10:07:59] <johnbender> when I do the curl to refresh the file
[10:08:19] <johnbender> it gives me the file and not the plain text response I get for the other files
[10:08:36] <johnbender> danheberden: do we need to do anything special to tell the cdn about new files?
[10:08:46] <johnbender> gseguin: let me get you the sha
[10:08:51] <danheberden> johnbender just the ?reload flag
[10:08:57] <danheberden> still takes a few minutes
[10:08:59] <johnbender> 8f636e5699abc21a924f98151adf367462693840
[10:09:03] <johnbender> danheberden: hmm
[10:09:41] <johnbender> when I do the curl with reload it sends back the file contents
[10:10:19] <danheberden> that's not right
[10:10:24] <danheberden> it is sending the param properly then?
[10:10:33] <johnbender> danheberden: let me paste what I'm doing
[10:10:40] <johnbender> curl -s http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/js/jquery.mobile.docs.zip?reload
[10:11:14] <johnbender> cargo culted the -s from the post commit hook
[10:11:23] <johnbender> silent
[10:11:26] <johnbender> should be fine
[10:11:37] <johnbender> sorry
[10:11:40] <johnbender> that's the zip
[10:11:46] <danheberden> yeah, that _should_ be fine
[10:11:55] <johnbender> but with the js it sends back the js
[10:12:02] <danheberden> -d is the only thing that should be effing it up
[10:12:03] * gseguin is lost
[10:12:05] <danheberden> what's the file
[10:12:06] <danheberden> ?
[10:12:07] <johnbender> just s/.zip/.js/
[10:12:34] <danheberden> ohhh
[10:12:37] <danheberden> you aren't reloading code.origin
[10:12:45] <johnbender> ?
[10:12:52] <johnbender> hmm
[10:12:57] <danheberden> so, ?reload just triggers a script on code.origin.jquery.com
[10:12:58] <johnbender> so why does the other respond propery
[10:13:01] <danheberden> so you put the file there
[10:13:05] <johnbender> yah it's there
[10:13:07] <johnbender> let me try that
[10:13:07] <danheberden> johnbender it probably cached it that way
[10:13:10] <danheberden> like, as a file :/
[10:13:14] <danheberden> cdn can be weird like taht
[10:13:35] <johnbender> ok it worked with code origin
[10:13:45] <danheberden> yeah, it's a script john wrote i think
[10:13:56] <danheberden> but it just takes that file and submits it to get recached by edgecast
[10:14:01] <johnbender> there we go!
[10:14:12] <danheberden> pretty much, you never do anything directly on the cdn
[10:14:15] <johnbender> danheberden: thanks for being another set of eyes
[10:14:17] <danheberden> except, like, use it to get files
[10:14:22] <johnbender> danheberden: yah that makes perfect sense
[10:14:32] <johnbender> I think the only reason I didn't look at that was the response it was providing otherwise :D
[10:14:48] <johnbender> gseguin: problems solved
[10:14:53] <johnbender> I'll make the updated to the post commit hook
[10:14:55] <gseguin> yup I see that
[10:15:22] <gseguin> awesome
[10:15:26] <gseguin> gotta go
[10:15:51] <johnbender> gseguin: peace1
[10:15:55] <johnbender> s/1/!/
[10:17:08] <johnbender> toddparker: alright we sorted out the problem
[10:17:20] <johnbender> but I need to talk with eddie about how he deploys changes to the website
[10:17:45] <johnbender> toddparker: hmm nevermind the changes are there
[10:18:02] <johnbender> well
[10:18:06] <johnbender> still need to talk with him about it
[10:23:47] <johnbender> danheberden: gnarf: let me know if you guys get some time soon to chat, I'm flexible and I'd love to help out with infra if I can
[10:24:42] <danheberden> johnbender we will - we have a board meeting today to discuss allocating time to get the ball rolling on setup, so it'll be soon :)
[10:25:07] <johnbender> danheberden: sweet
[10:27:28] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #414: SUCCESS in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/414/
[10:27:28] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Moved the pagecreate handler registration for controlgroups to the init IIFE so it's executed after all required widgets have registered theirs
[10:27:29] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Remove unnecessary order! plugins
[10:27:29] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Removed all instances of data-position="inline" in headers
[10:27:50] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin I'm going to work on getting the docs and bug fixes in master picked over to 1.0.1 and then I'll deal with the build branch
[10:27:50] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[10:31:46] <gseguin> bot-t: got message for me?
[10:31:46] <bot-t> (3 mins 56 secs ago) <johnbender> tell gseguin I'm going to work on getting the docs and bug fixes in master picked over to 1.0.1 and then I'll deal with the build branch
[10:31:46] <bot-t> gseguin, Ask again later.
[10:32:00] <gseguin> ok johnbender
[10:39:02] <gseguin> toddparker: Should we communicate more about: https://github.com/appMobi/jQ.Mobi/issues/8 ?
[10:39:02] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #8 on jQ.Mobi, reported by danheberden (3d, 19h ago): Rename Repository and Project
[10:40:21] <gseguin> like at least tweeting the url?
[10:42:14] <danheberden> gseguin i think if the project takes any action, it will be best to do so privately
[10:42:52] <danheberden> we've had some inner discussion about it, and have a board meeting today which, i'm sure, will be brought up then too
[10:43:44] <gseguin> ok, I was hoping that pressure from the community was going to be enough for these guys to do the right thing
[10:44:20] <gseguin> but I didn't see any tweet about it so that's why I was asking
[10:44:21] <danheberden> personally, i think it's a marketing/bad-attempt-at-money-making scheme, so bad press it good press in their eyes
[10:44:23] <danheberden> me thinks, anyway
[10:45:02] <johnbender> danheberden: high road imo
[10:45:11] <johnbender> we can, and should win with code
[10:45:19] <johnbender> wish them well and do a better job
[10:45:20] <danheberden> johnbender you already have :D
[10:45:28] <johnbender> danheberden: that's what I think
[10:45:33] <johnbender> which makes it a non issue
[10:45:42] <gseguin> though they're a framework so if they piss off the dev community their chance of getting adopted is pretty low
[10:46:12] <johnbender> true, but any drama we stir up only lends importance to their cause
[10:46:26] <gseguin> johnbender: I agree with having competition
[10:46:39] <johnbender> it can only make us better
[10:46:46] <johnbender> maybe we can steal some neat trick they come up with
[10:46:49] <danheberden> yeah, that's a good plan - keep them around so your competition always sucks :p
[10:46:49] <gseguin> I disagree with using our brand
[10:47:31] <johnbender> gseguin: yah that's harder to say, I mean it's obvious to a well informed dev but there was confusion for me with jqtouch and jquerymobile
[10:47:32] <danheberden> gseguin that was the slap in the face, and what i felt was rude
[10:47:37] <johnbender> way back when
[10:47:49] <danheberden> but whatevs, i can't blame them - they wanna be part of the cool club
[10:47:55] <johnbender> :D
[10:48:14] <johnbender> from my twitter profile "oss enthusiast, father, and aspiring cool kid"
[10:48:30] <gseguin> :)
[10:54:25] <gseguin> johnbender: when you come to working on the build
[10:54:31] <gseguin> anotther thing to do
[10:54:59] <gseguin> is create a jquery.mobile.structure.css that contains @import statements for the structure css files
[10:55:13] <gseguin> and get rid of the list in the Makefile
[10:55:20] <johnbender> gseguin: alright
[10:55:26] <johnbender> we'll see where I get
[10:55:32] <johnbender> I'm fighting against diff right now
[10:55:32] <gseguin> if you don't get to it I'll try to tackle that over the weekend
[11:14:47] <toddparker> gseguin - we're talking about the jqmobi stuff with the board now
[11:14:54] <toddparker> best to ignore 'em for now
[11:15:03] <toddparker> hey /test/ is back to looking good
[11:15:08] <toddparker> thanks guys!
[11:16:09] <johnbender> toddparker: yah we should be in good shape
[11:16:26] <johnbender> we'll want to move that build process to jenkins so we can get updates when it fails
[11:16:42] <johnbender> maybe we can do that in tandem with moving the ci builds to the ui jenkins
[11:22:43] <gseguin> toddparker: yes I was and yes I will
[11:44:30] <kinblas> toddparker: ping
[11:44:46] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm only skimming that transitions thread on github
[11:44:58] <kinblas> toddparker: you might want to read this too if you haven't already
[11:44:59] <kinblas> https://plus.google.com/105051985738280261832/posts/2FXDCz8x93s
[11:47:43] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm looking at docs change from agcolom that adds data-title to the data attributes, that hasn't changed recently has it
[11:47:52] <johnbender> ie, it should go into 1.0.1
[11:47:59] <johnbender> just double checking
[11:52:13] <johnbender> gseguin: when did we release 1.0
[11:52:27] <johnbender> checking if the overlayTheme addition to select menu's came before
[11:52:32] <johnbender> pretty sure it did
[11:54:49] <gseguin> johnbender: Nov 16
[11:55:05] <johnbender> gseguin: perfect
[11:55:11] <johnbender> you put the change in the 4th
[11:55:13] <johnbender> so it went out
[11:55:16] <johnbender> lol
[11:55:27] <gseguin> oh good
[11:55:30] <johnbender> figuring out how to quickly review a bunch of commits matching some simple commit description has been interesting
[11:56:55] <johnbender> sadly with that crazytown merge/revert that we did with fixed toolbar it's hard to look through
[11:57:02] <johnbender> I don't know how to exclude that from the grap
[11:57:04] <johnbender> or even if you can
[11:57:17] <johnbender> so I have like every commit for a long time in the past before I can get down to actual work
[11:57:20] <johnbender> :(
[12:01:12] <johnbender> toddparker: hey, I'm running into somethign of a wall here
[12:01:24] <johnbender> I've got a good chunk of docs changes
[12:01:39] <johnbender> that I think should go in
[12:01:49] <johnbender> but I'm just sort of looking for Fixes
[12:01:49] <johnbender> etc
[12:02:13] <johnbender> but there are commits that aren't obvious that have docs changes and other odd stuff
[12:06:07] <toddparker> hey johnbender
[12:06:11] <toddparker> sorry,w as on a clal
[12:06:13] <toddparker> call
[12:06:16] <johnbender> toddparker: np
[12:06:28] <toddparker> oh yeah?
[12:06:35] <toddparker> do you have links i can look at?
[12:06:40] <johnbender> toddparker: yah, I'm not too concerned about the bug fixes
[12:06:44] <johnbender> toddparker: hmm
[12:07:03] <johnbender> toddparker: well I'm getting a _sense_ for what changed with
[12:07:09] <johnbender> ...
[12:07:30] <johnbender> git diff 1.0-stable..master docs/
[12:07:47] <johnbender> it's relatively obvious what needs to come over
[12:07:52] <johnbender> the data attr stuff I think
[12:07:55] <toddparker> good
[12:07:56] <johnbender> the theme track doesn't
[12:07:58] <johnbender> those kinds of things
[12:08:08] <toddparker> theme track?
[12:08:12] <toddparker> oh for slider
[12:08:15] <johnbender> yah
[12:08:18] <johnbender> trackTheme?
[12:08:23] <johnbender> something like that
[12:08:57] <johnbender> toddparker: also there are a couple doc changes that take the type attr out of some script include tag examples?
[12:09:01] <toddparker> yeah. you want to hold that for 1.1, right?
[12:09:04] <johnbender> is there a reason for that?
[12:09:06] <johnbender> toddparker: yah
[12:09:08] <johnbender> definitely
[12:09:20] <johnbender> just lighter weight?
[12:09:25] <toddparker> someone said it wasn't needed for an html5 doctype
[12:09:35] <johnbender> orly
[12:09:41] <johnbender> the default is js
[12:09:43] <toddparker> that was what the ticket said
[12:09:43] <johnbender> very interesting
[12:09:55] <toddparker> worth double-checking (again)
[12:10:05] <toddparker> sure we looked into it at the time
[12:10:10] <toddparker> you have an issue #
[12:10:17] <toddparker> i can look if not
[12:10:47] <johnbender> not to worry
[12:10:58] <johnbender> I'm just thinking there's a high percentage chance I'll miss something
[12:11:18] <johnbender> the thing I'm more worried about is not getting bug fixes in
[12:11:28] <johnbender> since we're not always using the github convention
[12:11:55] <johnbender> I'm pretty sure we've been good about cherry picking them over
[12:11:59] <toddparker> meaning "closes #1234"
[12:12:07] <johnbender> or Fixes #1234 but yah
[12:12:14] <toddparker> well, if we miss a few, it's not the end of the world
[12:13:44] <johnbender> yah
[12:13:48] <johnbender> thats what a patch release is
[12:13:51] <johnbender> a better than
[12:13:56] <johnbender> and we will have the list of new things
[12:14:07] <johnbender> since that's easy to get from the stable branch
[12:17:57] <toddparker> right
[12:20:50] <toddparker> my main concern is that we can fully test that branch with 1.6.4 on all the devices
[12:21:08] <toddparker> but i should be able to just pull down that branch or use the branch preview, right?
[12:21:15] <toddparker> nothing special i need to do for testing?
[12:36:15] <Wilto> Yo yo.
[12:38:29] <Wilto> Anything on fire? I’ve been largely tuned-out for the day, and it’s starting to make me uneasy.
[12:39:26] <toddparker> your pants, Wilto, YOUR PANTS
[12:40:31] <Wilto> how did you know
[12:42:48] <toddparker> eh
[12:42:52] <toddparker> how's the conf
[12:43:06] <toddparker> you get bar bars fixed yet? c'mon!
[12:43:11] <Wilto> If I hear the phrase “UX designer” one more time, I’m gonna fling a chair.
[12:43:19] <toddparker> DO IT
[12:43:31] <Wilto> This is… not a conference for developers.
[12:43:35] <toddparker> anything mind blowing
[12:43:40] <toddparker> yeah?
[12:43:43] <Wilto> Or people who do real things in the world, really.
[12:43:47] <toddparker> heh
[12:43:52] <Wilto> Grigs’ thing was good, but drew a lot of blank stares.
[12:44:00] <toddparker> just a bunch of whiney designer types?
[12:44:31] <toddparker> do people still say they "slice" their designs there? do they?
[12:44:48] <Wilto> I snuck into his jQuery Mobile workshop on the first day and just sat quietly in the back. No bad news to report.
[12:45:16] <Wilto> Except “pageInit is flaky.”
[12:45:34] <toddparker> it is now?
[12:45:43] <toddparker> wokay
[12:45:43] <Wilto> I dunno, man—lot of inhouse people with ill-defined job titles at this thing.
[12:45:52] <Wilto> Not that I knew of.
[12:46:13] <toddparker> you're not PUSHIN' it as HARD
[12:46:17] <toddparker> feel the burn
[12:46:33] <toddparker> too much caffeine, sorry
[12:47:03] <toddparker> oh on the forms in bars, guess working in a branch would be good there.
[12:47:16] <toddparker> my worry is scope leaks
[12:47:22] <toddparker> but man, out stuff is busted
[12:47:26] <toddparker> embarrasing
[12:47:35] <Wilto> Oof, _that_ bad, huh?
[12:48:05] <johnbender> toddparker: hmm well testing manually will be harder
[12:48:15] <johnbender> toddparker: gseguin set it up so the docs use the jquery script loader
[12:48:26] <johnbender> and I have to merge that branch today at some point
[12:49:05] <johnbender> toddparker: and we aren't supporting 1.7.x for stable though right?
[12:49:17] <johnbender> but that also makes the docs more confusing
[12:49:29] <johnbender> because there isn't a direct ref to jquery
[12:49:45] <toddparker> yeah
[12:49:48] <toddparker> confusing
[12:49:52] <Wilto> I thought we were switching to jQ.mobi.
[12:50:14] <toddparker> same features, 90% less stupid code
[12:50:25] <Wilto> Code is for chumps.
[12:50:46] <johnbender> we've done our best to add in useless random variables and functions to bloat our library
[12:50:50] <Wilto> Anyway, yeah, fixing those toolbars is my plan for the train ride home.
[12:50:51] <toddparker> my car drives so much faster without doors or seats.
[12:50:56] <toddparker> cool
[12:51:08] <toddparker> i think you can make big strides in short order
[12:51:20] <toddparker> just need to rethink bout scoping a bit.
[12:51:20] <Wilto> Yeah, sounds like my wheelhouse.
[12:51:24] <johnbender> toddparker: I was going to get some test builds going for the different versions of jquery, but do you want to be able to test with different versions manually?
[12:51:30] <toddparker> DONT SAY WHEELHOUSE
[12:51:36] <Wilto> I WILL SAY IT ALWAYS
[12:51:42] <toddparker> i'd like to johnbender
[12:52:08] <toddparker> makes me nervous to not do a run-through on every device with the final code
[12:52:51] <toddparker> 1.0.1 needs to be testable on 1.6.4 somehow
[12:52:55] <Wilto> What Could Go Wrong?™
[12:53:22] <toddparker> i'd also like to see what happens with 1.7.1..do you know if there are changes that would break 1.0.1 with 1.7.1?
[12:53:24] <johnbender> toddparker: its ONLY 1.6.4
[12:53:28] <toddparker> but that's extra credit
[12:53:37] <toddparker> sure
[12:53:47] <johnbender> if you want to test it thought we can try and figure something out
[12:53:49] <toddparker> right, let's keep this simple and get ti done
[12:53:51] <johnbender> I mean gseguin did already
[12:53:56] <toddparker> ok
[12:54:03] <johnbender> but I was thinking we'd want to leave that out of the stable branch
[12:54:24] <toddparker> leave what out?
[12:54:34] <johnbender> the code to test out different versions
[12:54:44] <toddparker> ah, i see
[12:54:59] <johnbender> I really just wanted to use it for the test builds
[12:55:00] <toddparker> so for 1.0.1 if we can just hard code it to test on 1.6.4, that's cool
[12:55:15] <toddparker> going forward, we are going to need to find a way to test either.
[12:55:20] <johnbender> toddparker: so the js/jquery.js in the 1.0-stable branch is 1.6.4
[12:55:22] <toddparker> thought a query param might be an option?
[12:55:31] <toddparker> ok, cool
[12:55:38] <johnbender> toddparker: yah the stable branches post 1.1 will need to have something
[12:55:45] <johnbender> toddparker: that's what the solution is
[12:56:02] <johnbender> but it means we don't include js/jquery.js directly so you can use the query param
[12:56:29] <Wilto> …this is literally an entire presentation about what people should say is their job title.
[12:57:02] <toddparker> i see johnbender
[12:57:30] <Wilto> So! toddparker, did you chuck together a test page for those busted widgets?
[12:57:38] <toddparker> the docs keep getting less like a real site to accommodate all the stuff we need to do logitically
[12:57:50] <johnbender> toddparker: exactly
[12:57:54] <johnbender> which is why I wanted to avoid that
[12:57:57] <toddparker> i attached one to that email Wilto
[12:58:08] <Wilto> Oh, my bad.
[12:58:17] <toddparker> you can just drop it into your /docs/toolbars/ folder
[12:58:20] <toddparker> so old skool
[12:58:21] <Wilto> oh god
[12:58:28] <Wilto> That isn’t not broken.
[12:58:44] <toddparker> shoulda done a branch or a gist or sumpin
[12:58:53] <toddparker> see the screengrab
[12:58:57] <toddparker> ?
[12:59:01] <Wilto> Yeah, man. Brutal.
[12:59:03] <toddparker> train wreck
[12:59:08] <toddparker> yeah, no joke
[12:59:14] <toddparker> embarrassing.
[12:59:58] <toddparker> you might need to make a few test pages with some likely scenarios since you can't really jam all those form elements into a 5 column grid like that
[13:00:31] <toddparker> just think about common UI conventions and do a few mockups.
[13:01:12] <toddparker> like if I wanted a search field in top top right of a header, how to do that? tried wrapping with a div.span with ui-btn-right but that messed up the home button. etc.
[13:01:33] <toddparker> those just need some better examples and style tweaks/classes to make it easier
[13:01:47] <toddparker> i woulda quit after working on that
[13:01:58] <toddparker> in general, we make buttons smaller in a header
[13:02:33] <toddparker> wonder if we should think about having a "compact" version of all form elements that are all the same height as the buttons now and are designed to look nice
[13:02:54] <toddparker> we just did a bunch of special case stuff for L/R header buttons and didn't touch anything else
[13:03:11] <Wilto> Yeah, that’s what I was thinking, at a glance.
[13:03:45] <toddparker> another common thing would be  to have a header with a bar under it with just a search field
[13:04:00] <toddparker> or a bar with a toggle and some buttons or a dropdown
[13:04:16] <toddparker> or a field with a scope select and a go button
[13:04:20] <toddparker> easy stuff like that
[13:04:55] <toddparker> we probably need a way to put a spacer/vertical line to delineate stuff in a bar
[13:05:10] <toddparker> last thought: an option to have button-less elements
[13:05:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 8 new commits to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/eOTeMA
[13:05:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Update docs/about/getting-started.html - Chetan K Jain
[13:05:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Update docs/pages/page-anatomy.html - Chetan K Jain
[13:05:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Update docs/api/data-attributes.html - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[13:06:25] <johnbender> toddparker: do you have a quick second?
[13:06:29] <johnbender> super quick
[13:07:06] <johnbender> toddparker: git diff 1.0-stable..master docs/api/data-attributes.html
[13:07:26] <johnbender> can you tell me if all that (save the script includes) should be brought over
[13:18:17] <gseguin> ARRRR.... johnbender I knew it was a bad idea to remove the define( "jquery" ) from jquery.js
[13:18:34] <gseguin> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/jquery-version-selector/index.html?jquery=1.6.4 is not working anymore :(
[13:18:42] <toddparker> sure johnbender
[13:27:08] <Wilto> (First reference to “slicing up a Photoshop file.”)
[13:27:25] <Wilto> http://bukk.it/tableflip.gif
[13:30:36] <Wilto> Hey, are the new fixed header/footers… generally busted on master right now?
[13:31:00] <gseguin> they shouldn't be
[13:31:13] <gseguin> unless I missed something
[13:31:15] <Wilto> They’re kinda freaking out in Chrome.
[13:31:52] <gseguin> on http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html ?
[13:32:16] <Wilto> They look good on load, but when you do the “click to hide” thing the footer jumps to somewhere strange.
[13:32:38] <Wilto> Just dunno what’s a bug and what’s, like, a merge thing.
[13:33:11] <gseguin> oh I see it now
[13:33:17] <gseguin> toddparker would know
[13:34:24] <Wilto> Paging toddparker.
[13:34:26] <toddparker> wilto - on master?
[13:34:49] <Wilto> Yeah. I just made a new branch for this fixed/forms issue, and noticed the fixed behavior was a little off.
[13:34:56] <Wilto> Same on master.
[13:35:34] <toddparker> so bars-fixed.html on chrome/mac?
[13:35:39] <Wilto> Yessir.
[13:35:43] <toddparker> hmmm
[13:35:46] <toddparker> looks ok here
[13:35:50] <Wilto> Working normally, but clicking to hide breaks the footer.
[13:35:52] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm confused as to why that doesn't work
[13:36:12] <toddparker> wilt - here too? http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html
[13:36:18] <toddparker> heh Wilto
[13:36:24] <toddparker> or "wilt"
[13:36:29] <gseguin> johnbender: because at the time the define is called, jQuery is not available yet
[13:36:48] <Wilto> Yeah—scroll down a little bit, then click somewhere in the document.
[13:36:53] <johnbender> gseguin: I thought we were in control of the define
[13:36:56] <johnbender> in that case
[13:37:00] <Wilto> The header fades out, but the footer just moves.
[13:37:02] <toddparker> footer does look a tad taller than the header in general. needs fixing in a separate commit
[13:37:14] <toddparker> ooooh
[13:37:16] <toddparker> i see that
[13:37:27] <Wilto> We nuked the old fixed branch, yeah?
[13:37:33] <johnbender> gseguin: that is, we load jsquer and then do the define
[13:37:37] <johnbender> *jquery
[13:37:43] <toddparker> think we did
[13:37:49] <gseguin> we do a document.write
[13:37:50] <Wilto> Hm.
[13:37:58] <toddparker> yep
[13:38:01] <toddparker> gone
[13:38:06] <gseguin> but jquery is not available immediatly after that
[13:38:13] <Wilto> Ah well; probably something minor.
[13:38:18] <johnbender> gseguin: I thought if you set innerHTML it would be
[13:38:18] <Wilto> I’ll take a quick look at that first.
[13:38:19] <toddparker> makes me wonder what else
[13:38:25] <toddparker> this is probably easily fixable
[13:38:27] <toddparker> kk
[13:38:29] <johnbender> gseguin: we do that on loading jqm pages for that very reasonn
[13:38:36] <Wilto> s/first/now\ because\ this\ is\ boring
[13:38:43] <toddparker> hee
[13:38:50] <toddparker> you're innovating here
[13:39:14] <Wilto> I’m now a Senior UX Methodology Technologist.
[13:39:44] <Wilto> Update my business cards, STAT.
[13:39:56] <gseguin> johnbender: so doing the script tag insertion with innerHTML instead of document.write ?
[13:40:14] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm under the impression that makes it immediate yah
[13:40:22] <johnbender> I could be wrong though
[13:40:30] <gseguin> johnbender: I'll try it out tonight
[13:40:58] <toddparker> wilt - that is odd with the footer
[13:41:07] <toddparker> how are we hiding it?
[13:41:13] <johnbender> gseguin: kk I'm probably going to get to it later hopefully
[13:41:17] <toddparker> Wilto ^
[13:42:02] <toddparker> hmmm.
[13:42:04] <Wilto> Just tacking a class on there, which looks like it’s still happening. Might just be a CSS deal.
[13:42:06] <toddparker> .ui-fixed-hidden {
[13:42:07] <toddparker> 	position: absolute;
[13:42:07] <toddparker> }
[13:42:13] * gseguin goes back to jive activities
[13:42:16] <Wilto> Yup, that’ll do it.
[13:42:20] <toddparker> yeah, if you click again, it's re-pos right
[13:42:31] <toddparker> but why is the header hidden right?
[13:43:10] <Wilto> It has the fade on it, too…
[13:43:21] <toddparker> also
[13:43:27] <toddparker> click to hide
[13:43:33] <johnbender> toddparker: did you already respond on the data attributes docs?
[13:43:46] <toddparker> then scroll up and there is a slot where the header should be
[13:44:15] <toddparker> the logic is supposed to be that if a toolbar is fixed into view tap hides it
[13:44:22] <Wilto> Shenanigans.
[13:44:26] <toddparker> but if you're already at the top, it should be there
[13:44:41] <toddparker> sort of looks like the fullscreen behavior where it should hide the header
[13:45:05] <toddparker> shenanigans indeed
[13:45:31] <Wilto> I mean, the “absolute” makes sense.
[13:45:40] <Wilto> Since we don’t want it to occupy space like the header does.
[13:45:59] <toddparker> BOOM - http://jquerymobile.com/branches/css-fixed/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html
[13:46:14] <toddparker> branch preview is still there
[13:46:18] <toddparker> works great
[13:46:29] <Wilto> Still seeing a little weirdness…
[13:46:36] <toddparker> yeah?
[13:47:00] <toddparker> seems to work right for me
[13:47:02] <Wilto> Different weirdness, though.
[13:47:15] <toddparker> if @ the top, tap only hides footer
[13:47:20] <toddparker> if in middle, tap hides both
[13:47:30] <toddparker> if at bottom, tap only hides the header
[13:48:02] <Wilto> Alright, try this:
[13:48:24] <Wilto> Scroll down and click, scroll to the top and click, then scroll down and click again.
[13:49:02] <Wilto> The header is staying visible.
[13:49:35] <toddparker> yup
[13:49:40] <toddparker> that is messed up
[13:49:50] <Wilto> Websites are the worst.
[13:49:54] <toddparker> but it's better than master fo sure
[13:49:59] <toddparker> seriously
[13:50:00] <Wilto> Hang on—I’m gonna duck outta here so I can concentrate.
[13:50:02] <Wilto> Oh, no question.
[13:50:03] <toddparker> let
[13:50:06] <toddparker> us
[13:50:08] <toddparker> build
[13:50:12] <toddparker> in shockwave
[13:50:16] <toddparker> pleez
[13:50:21] <Wilto> SECONDED
[13:50:26] <Wilto> Back in ten.
[13:50:29] <toddparker> Q?
[13:50:31] <toddparker> k
[13:51:24] <toddparker> johnbender: I think all the changes to the data- ref page look good for 1.0.1
[13:52:38] <johnbender> toddparker: kk pulling them in
[14:13:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 3 new commits to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/hYHGVg

[14:18:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Fix for issue #3305 - Confusing documentation about dataUrl in changePage - jblas@adobe.com
[14:19:35] <Wilto> Back. I’m tethering, so I’m gonna go dark for a bit. Working on the fixed stuff now.
[14:23:49] <johnbender> toddparker: alright, I'm pretty confident that the docs are mostly up to date
[14:23:55] <johnbender> I'm having a hard time finding other stuff
[14:23:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/YjSipA
[14:23:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Removed reference to data-role="dialog". Fixes #3294 - Todd Parker
[14:23:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Fixed closing p - Ghislain Seguin
[14:24:01] <johnbender> yeesh what a nightmare
[14:24:18] <johnbender> just reading the through the chnages using git log -p for the whole docs dir
[14:24:43] <johnbender> not quite sure what to do about bugs though :(
[14:34:23] <johnbender> toddparker: de9d20e5bd2e34afbc061698f1894a20c1a07764
[14:34:30] <johnbender> optimizing pngs?
[14:41:15] <toddparker> that can go into 1.0.1
[14:41:20] <toddparker> just better compression
[14:41:32] <johnbender> cool
[14:41:45] <toddparker> shouldn't have changed anything visually
[14:45:02] <johnbender> toddparker: alright
[14:45:05] <johnbender> my eyeballing is done
[14:45:11] <johnbender> I'm semi sure it's all in there
[14:47:02] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm going to go try innerHTML
[14:47:19] <gseguin> alright
[14:47:26] <gseguin> let me know your findings
[14:47:31] <johnbender> yah we'll see
[14:47:54] <gseguin> otherwise putting that define in jquery.js (which is not needed anyway) works just fine
[14:50:16] <toddparker> i'm going to head out in a few
[14:50:32] <toddparker> johnbender: i'll do some release notes this weekend
[14:51:06] <johnbender> toddparker: kk
[15:46:57] <johnbender> gseguin:
[15:47:02] <johnbender> so that didn't work at all
[15:47:04] <johnbender> _but_
[15:47:18] <johnbender> I did come up with another worse and better way of doing it
[15:49:23] <johnbender> when the search param is defined it pushes a sync load of jquery at the top of the asyncLoad method
[15:49:31] <johnbender> and I leave the original require in there
[16:25:48] <Wilto> Alright, I’m stumped.
[16:25:56] <Wilto> Anyone still around?
[16:26:02] <johnbender> yah
[16:26:05] <johnbender> just finishing something up
[16:26:21] <Wilto> I don’t imagine there’s any way I can compare master to a branch we deleted, is there?
[16:26:39] <Wilto> Something’s wrong with native fixed on master.
[16:26:54] <Wilto> When I link to the JS still floating around in the aether on http://jquerymobile.com/branches/css-fixed/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html, it works as expected.
[16:27:29] <Wilto> I’m just trial-and-error-ing my way through this—comparing files on master to the ones at that preview link—and it’s not getting me anywhere.
[16:28:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender created jquery-test-reloader (+4 new commits): http://git.io/OdM97A

[16:28:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/jquery-test-reloader] Revert "Use jQuery tag inserter instead of pointing directly at jquery.js" - John Bender
[16:28:13] <Wilto> I also tried linking to js/index.php locally to rule out Require—same behavior.
[16:30:02] <johnbender> Wilto: not without the branch
[16:30:09] <Wilto> Fantastic.
[16:32:09] <johnbender> Wilto: do you need the fixed toolbar branch?
[16:33:03] <Wilto> Wouldn’t hurt to have it, but where Scott’s changes got merged in manually I’m not even sure how much that will help.
[16:33:14] <Wilto> I could diff stuff quicker, at least.
[16:33:55] <johnbender> Wilto: yah there's a big diff because of all the random change from whatever caused all those issues
[16:34:30] <Wilto> Ugh. Trial and error it is, then.

[22:21:50] <gseguin> toddparker, toddmparker_: ping
[22:35:19] <gseguin> Wilto: ping
[22:35:33] <Wilto> Yo.
[22:35:40] <gseguin> hey, working late?
[22:35:53] <Wilto> Stumblin’ drunk, sir.
[22:35:54] <gseguin> quick question for you
[22:35:57] <Wilto> Whassup?
[22:36:21] <gseguin> shouldn't jquery.mobile.structure.css contain all the css files in css/structure/
[22:36:22] <gseguin> ?
[22:38:11] <Wilto> Hm, that’s a new one on me.
[22:38:55] <Wilto> Last I saw, we had like jquery.mobile.css doing all the @import stuff, yeah?
[22:39:05] <gseguin> correct
[22:39:28] <gseguin> but we're also distributing the structure file so people can develop their own theme
[22:39:54] <gseguin> thing is the structure file is generated by the Makefile
[22:40:54] <gseguin> meaning the list of files it contains is defined in the makefile whereas the list of structure files in the theme.css is specified as @import in the theme css file
[22:41:13] <gseguin> and the lists are out of sync
[22:41:27] <gseguin> so I wanted to consolidate
[22:41:48] <gseguin> so that doesn't happen again
[22:42:01] <Wilto> Ah-hah, I think I follow you now.
[22:42:48] <gseguin> oh I just saw your "Stumblin’ drunk, sir." ;)
[22:42:56] <gseguin> sorry for ruining your buzz :P
[22:43:01] <Wilto> Yessir.
[22:44:09] <gseguin> alright I'll make a PR and will discuss it with you sober
[22:44:23] <Wilto> Hah! Generally a good move.
[22:45:37] <Wilto> But if I follow you, the main idea is that we have some overlap between what the makefile generates and the theming territory, yeah?
[22:46:42] <Wilto> As in, like… The inheritance is out of order?
[22:47:00] <gseguin> not overlap, if I understand it the list of @imported files in jquery.mobile.css and the list of css in the Makefile should be the same
[22:47:04] <gseguin> and it's not
[22:48:37] <gseguin> do you see it?
[22:54:02] <Wilto> Hm. Got both here, but my CSS’ index seems to be grabbing jquery.mobile.css just the same.
[22:54:36] <gseguin> hm
[22:56:11] <Wilto> I wouldn’t say I’m a 10 on the 1–10 helpfulness scale right now.
[22:56:33] <Wilto> I should be able to catch up over the weekend, though.
[22:57:01] <gseguin> :)
[22:57:14] <gseguin> alright
[22:57:41] <gseguin> just so it's in here I'll drop the links to what I'm talking about:
[22:57:43] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/Makefile#L2-16
[22:58:13] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.css#L2-24
[22:58:34] <gseguin> these, I think should be the same list of files and they aren't
[22:59:14] <Wilto> With the exception of the new transition styles, they seem about the same.
[23:02:39] <gseguin> so I'm basically consolidating all these into a new file so there will be only one list to maintain
