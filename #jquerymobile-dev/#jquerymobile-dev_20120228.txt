[04:04:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] improved keyboard accessibility and tabindex roving for custom select menus. They were previously semi-keyboard accessible, but the visual feedback was poor, and tabindexes were set in the wrong places. This seems to do the trick, but requesting a a11y overview from @wilto if he has time :) Fixes #3658 - scottjehl
[05:47:02] <elfgoh> For anyone interested in how to hide the back button, my solution is $('div#foo a[data-rel=back]').hide()
[05:47:18] <elfgoh> Oops wrong channel sorry
[05:47:29] <elfgoh> Shld be in the non dev channel
[07:01:53] <toddmparker_> elfgoh :)
[07:10:44] <elfgoh> Hello, sorry to bug the channel… But I have a bug…. I am happy to file the report but would like to test it against 1.1rc1…. It's coming soon right ? :)
[07:11:12] <elfgoh> I have it all summarised in 9 lines of code here if anyone is keen to take a peek http://dpaste.com/708922/
[07:12:12] <toddmparker_> elfgoh - please submit a bug in the tracker
[07:12:58] <toddmparker_> and post a test page using latest. template here: http://jsbin.com/ogelef/edit
[07:14:32] <elfgoh> toddmparker_: I would love to do that, but only after I can replicate it with JQM 1.1 Tks for the jsbin tip!
[07:15:39] <toddmparker_> sure
[07:15:52] <toddmparker_> that jsbin is using 1.1 for all intents and purposes
[07:17:18] <elfgoh> toddmparker_: ah ok will do that
[07:29:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm up
[07:30:11] <toddmparker_> hey bender

[07:30:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: k
[07:30:30] <toddmparker_> is it ok if you wait 10 minutes before pushing?
[07:34:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: totally
[07:35:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I actually didn't push the tag yesterday so we can put in as much as you want
[07:36:53] <toddmparker_> great!
[07:37:12] <Wilto> Nothin’ holding us up, really. Just want to see if I can patch up this One Last Thing™ before we put the word out.

[07:50:44] <Wilto> Dammit, Java.
[07:52:08] <johnbender> Wilto: s/Java/Media Temple/
[07:52:16] <johnbender> and even there I'm not sure
[07:52:22] <johnbender> NEEDS MOAR SWAP
[07:52:30] <Wilto> Me and Java got some bad blood between us, though.
[07:52:40] <Wilto> I _choose_ to blame it for things. I blame Java for, like… PHP errors.
[07:54:52] <Wilto> Also, this One Last Thing™ ain’t fixing quite so quickly as I thought it might. Absolutely not a blocker, though; I’m good with throwing the switch whenever you guys are.
[08:03:17] <toddmparker_> ok johnbender - I think we're ready to push this thing
[08:03:27] <toddmparker_> i just made a few small docs tweaks
[08:04:13] <toddmparker_> tho test isn't up to date
[08:04:41] <toddmparker_> anyway, we're ready to go whenever you are johnbender
[08:07:35] <johnbender> toddmparker_: cool I'll do a refresh then
[08:07:43] <toddmparker_> sounds good
[08:10:20] <toddmparker_> so this is the final URL for the docs, right? http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0-rc.1/

[08:24:29] <toddmparker_> great

[08:24:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixed select padding in demo - toddparker
[08:24:54] <toddmparker_> and i just fixed a demo page :)
[08:25:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: you might want to check the copy for those two paragraphs to make sure I didn't mangle it
[08:25:37] <toddmparker_> ok
[08:25:52] <toddmparker_> that can be tweaked if soemthing is off. i alwasy need to fix something
[08:26:32] <toddmparker_> test looks good. up-to-date
[08:30:19] <gseguin> johnbender: are you going to move the 1.0-rc.1 tag to that SHA1: 006b739b54
[08:31:58] <gseguin> johnbender: also, http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.1.0-rc.1/jquery.mobile-1.1.0-rc.1.js does not have the SHA1 which can make it difficult to identify, is that on purpose?
[08:49:40] <johnbender> gseguin: I can't the tag is pushed
[08:50:24] <gseguin> johnbender: what do you mean, pushed?
[08:50:29] <gseguin> to CDN ?
[08:50:35] <johnbender> gseguin: to the public repo
[08:50:51] <gseguin> that's ok though
[08:50:59] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm not clear on how they update
[08:51:13] <johnbender> I mean it's just a pointer
[08:51:25] <gseguin> you can change what commit it's pointing at and push again
[08:53:02] <gseguin> johnbender: what about putting the SHA1 in the jquery.mobile.js file ?
[08:53:35] <gseguin> it's a quick way to make sure the bundle contains the right bits
[08:53:54] <johnbender> gseguin: we haven't yet done that for a release
[08:53:57] <toddmparker_> seems like a good idea to me
[08:54:06] <johnbender> gseguin: as long as what's out there is the same as what's tagged I'm happy
[08:54:18] <johnbender> maybe for the full release
[08:54:25] <toddmparker_> johnbender: are the 1.1.0 demo and CDN files all up to date?
[08:54:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: deploying now
[08:54:33] <toddmparker_> i.e. should I blog
[08:54:34] <gseguin> johnbender: but that's what I'm saying how do you know it's the same ?
[08:54:37] <toddmparker_> kk
[08:54:39] <johnbender> the build is super super fragile
[08:55:18] <johnbender> gseguin: I get your point but puting a string at the top of the file isn't any more of a guarantee, at least from the perspective of the persone who's deploying
[08:55:31] <johnbender> if _you_ guy want to verify what we have out there, then it makes sense
[08:56:27] <johnbender> gseguin: toddmparker_: I can work on that this week if you want
[08:56:28] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm not saying it's secure, but it makes it easier for us to do a sanity check
[08:56:48] <johnbender> should be a quick change
[08:57:07] <gseguin> yep since we do it for the git build
[08:57:52] <johnbender> gseguin: I can probably just move the snipets in the docs out to the js/css build in that case no?
[08:58:47] <johnbender> ah nope
[08:58:49] * gseguin looks
[08:58:51] * johnbender sighs
[08:59:45] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll take care of it
[08:59:55] <gseguin> k
[09:00:02] <gseguin> as for the tag?
[09:00:13] <gseguin> are you going to move it and redeploy to CDN ?
[09:00:26] <johnbender> gseguin: moved :D
[09:00:31] <johnbender> and deployed
[09:00:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we should be good to go
[09:01:11] <toddmparker_> cool! leme check
[09:01:51] <gseguin> oh cool!
[09:02:05] <gseguin> alright, should count down ?
[09:05:53] <toddmparker_> think so!
[09:07:07] <toddmparker_> johnbender: your edits look good. much better than my version
[09:07:12] <toddmparker_> is hte perf stuff in the docs?
[09:07:39] <toddmparker_> anyway, think we're ready to go!
[09:07:44] <toddmparker_> gotta write a tweet
[09:10:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes, I there are warnings for both helpers and that setting
[09:10:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: let me check the data attributes
[09:11:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: well there's a warning on the helpers at least :/
[09:17:16] <toddmparker_> the deed is done!
[09:17:21] <toddmparker_> WOOOOO HOOOOO!!
[09:17:26] <toddmparker_> awesoem work everyone
[09:17:31] <toddmparker_> this looks *fantastic*

[09:23:42] <imjoshdean> Spreading the word around our mobile division now, while I can.
[09:26:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: lol it _feels_ like 1.1 final :D
[09:28:39] <toddmparker_> it does
[09:28:50] <toddmparker_> thanks imjoshdean
[09:28:54] <toddmparker_> BOOM
[09:37:11] <toddmparker_> another regression from the IE optimziation me things: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3660
[09:37:11] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3660 on jquery-mobile, reported by TylerBenziger (6m, 55s ago): Header's getting an undefined class
[09:37:19] <toddmparker_> these are causing a lot of headaches
[09:39:34] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sigh
[09:40:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll look into it
[09:58:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the issue is in buttonMarkup not in the checkboxradio
[09:58:59] <johnbender> the theme values aren't being inherited
[09:59:09] <johnbender> still looking for details
[10:00:01] <toddmparker_> hmm
[10:01:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it looks like the giant extend at the top is causing the issue
[10:02:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: at least for part of it
[10:04:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the button at the bottom is seeing a theme value of `null` when it goes to dump all the data attrs into the div
[10:06:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright now I'm just confused as to how this is supposed to work
[10:07:05] <johnbender> Wilto: you can probably help me out here too
[10:07:30] <johnbender> the button widget calls button markup with a null theme by default
[10:08:17] <johnbender> and there's no theme defined on the button itself
[10:08:42] <johnbender> so buttonMarkup uses the null value
[10:09:00] <johnbender> although the code in buttonMarkup does an explicit check for undefined so it wouldn't matter anyway
[10:09:13] <Wilto> With you so far.
[10:09:22] <johnbender> so as a result the data-theme is set to null
[10:09:40] <johnbender> so all the classes that rely on the theme letter end up with undefined
[10:09:52] <johnbender> because they ask for the data attribute value
[10:10:55] <johnbender> Wilto: for example
[10:11:03] <Wilto> Ohh.
[10:11:25] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js#L216
[10:11:44] <Wilto> So it either needs to be a == false check or something in buttonMarkup, or we need to not pass null in button. Yeha?
[10:11:57] <Wilto> s/yeha/yeah/i
[10:12:10] <johnbender> I was thinking the options merge could probably be a bit dummer
[10:12:20] <johnbender> are any of the options values permitted to be false?
[10:12:37] <johnbender> mini has to be true
[10:13:14] <johnbender> Wilto: and in either case what is buttonMarkup supposed to do when no theme is passed in
[10:13:59] <Wilto> …I feel like there are things that can be explicitly set to false, but don’t quote me 100%.
[10:14:18] <johnbender> Wilto: either way the button plugin is passing in null
[10:14:31] <johnbender> and there's no fallback
[10:14:46] <johnbender> so we need to address that first to solve this particular issue
[10:15:04] <johnbender> Wilto: what's the default theme?
[10:15:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[10:16:24] <Wilto> C? I wanna say “C.”
[10:16:27] <Wilto> For buttons.
[10:16:54] <johnbender> hmm
[10:16:59] <johnbender> now I'm really confused
[10:17:11] <johnbender> the selects are getting a default theme but there doesn't appear to be any defaulting logic there
[10:17:22] <johnbender> ah there it is
[10:17:26] <johnbender> get inherited theme
[10:18:24] <johnbender> Wilto: alright
[10:18:27] <johnbender> I think that solves the issue
[10:18:57] <toddmparker_> for a button?
[10:19:03] <toddmparker_> I think C
[10:19:24] <toddmparker_> tho it's technically A in a toolbar and C in the content
[10:19:31] <toddmparker_> because each have different default
[10:19:53] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the button plugin was missing a getInherited theme call
[10:20:06] <johnbender> I'm assuming that's the right behavior when it's not defined on the object or the prototype?
[10:22:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: same issue with checkboxradio
[10:23:46] <toddmparker_> bah
[10:24:17] <johnbender> once I make sure this change works I'll add some tests to make sure both widgets inherit
[10:24:20] <johnbender> :(
[10:25:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: them I'm going to refactor this crap because `this.theme` should be a method on widget
[10:26:25] <toddmparker_> refactor away
[10:26:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: hmm, maybe I'll wait until after 1.1 :D
[10:27:22] <toddmparker_> yeah, for sure
[10:27:32] <toddmparker_> is there an easier fix for now?
[10:27:40] <toddmparker_> just define these
[10:37:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yep, that's what I'm up to
[10:38:05] <johnbender> duct tape this shit and make it purty later

[12:17:56] <Wilto> Guys. I have some news that may shock you.
[12:18:18] <Wilto> The completely custom select menus? Kind of a black hole.
[12:27:36] <johnbender> ?
[12:28:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: btw we should freeze anything that's not a feature now, or branch to let people continue working

[13:20:50] <Wilto> Sup.
[13:21:26] <gseguin> do all the commits after the 1.1rc1 tag belong into the new branch ?
[13:21:53] <Wilto> Oh, retroactive to like yesterday, you mean?
[13:21:55] <Wilto> Nah.
[13:22:21] <gseguin> no no, 1.1rc1 tag was moved this morning
[13:22:32] <gseguin> it points at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/006b739b5422a04a7443d58d0b7a26ea0b866b91
[13:22:33] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by toddparker (4h, 58m ago): Fixed select padding in demo
[13:22:49] <gseguin> there are 6 commits after that
[13:22:52] <toddmparker_> so I sort of think that we could just work in master
[13:22:56] <gseguin> should they go in the branch
[13:23:04] <toddmparker_> then tag RC2 or final jsut like we did today
[13:23:12] <gseguin> oh ok
[13:23:15] <gseguin> that works too
[13:23:18] <toddmparker_> at the point we're final, we make a 1.1-stable branch
[13:23:32] <gseguin> as long as we don't start commiting future stuff in master
[13:23:36] <toddmparker_> feel like the stable branches work for maintenance stuff
[13:23:48] <toddmparker_> like for 1.2?
[13:23:56] <toddmparker_> i don't think we should anyway
[13:24:01] <toddmparker_> the 1.2 stuff is all in branches
[13:24:01] <gseguin> yeah
[13:24:02] <gseguin> ok
[13:24:13] <toddmparker_> and we should eb focusing on bug fixes only for like the next 6 weeks
[13:24:23] <gseguin> alright
[13:24:27] <toddmparker_> next week or two are 1.1 fixes
[13:24:36] <toddmparker_> after that, maintenance releases for 1.1
[13:25:16] <toddmparker_> which is our mega bug fix sprint
[13:25:26] <toddmparker_> if anyone is working on cool new stuff, STOP IT
[13:25:30] <toddmparker_> no having fun
[13:25:43] <gseguin> :)
[13:26:01] <Wilto> Aww, man.
[13:26:02] <toddmparker_> so are we ok with just working in master?
[13:26:08] <Wilto> Do deprecated custom selects count as “cool?”
[13:26:10] <toddmparker_> i'll defer to you guys on all things git
[13:26:18] <toddmparker_> nah
[13:26:23] <Wilto> They sure don’t.
[13:26:31] <gseguin> yeah it makes sense to work on master
[13:26:44] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[13:26:58] <toddmparker_> seemed to work up thru alphas and betas
[13:27:49] <gseguin> yeah yeah the branching was just if you wanted to land popup on master for instance
[13:29:25] <toddmparker_> i see
[13:29:51] <toddmparker_> I think we can wait on that until we get far along in bug fixes
[13:30:13] <toddmparker_> i'd rather have us all go through the library with a fine tooth comb and fix everything
[13:30:15] <gseguin> yup, no problem, waiting works too
[13:30:19] <toddmparker_> cool
[13:33:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: yap I'm fine with working in Master as long as everyone knows that they can't commit new stuff
[13:33:27] <johnbender> that in includes Scott
[13:33:47] <johnbender> most new stuff happens in branches anyway so that's fine
[13:37:55] <toddmparker_> ok
[13:53:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/1GG3nA
[13:53:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Update docs/nav.html - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[13:53:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3666 from agcolom/patch-63 - Ghislain Seguin
[14:04:02] <toddmparker_> i feel a great calm now that 1.1 is out
[14:04:15] <toddmparker_> this is *so* much better
[14:04:44] <toddmparker_> no bombs yet today so we should plan on fixing up the last things and going right to final when i'm back
[14:04:53] <toddmparker_> well, maybe not next Thu/Fri
[14:05:04] <toddmparker_> but the following week sometime
[14:05:19] <toddmparker_> unless it's uncool to do just one RC
[14:05:25] <toddmparker_> any standards on that?
[14:06:08] <gseguin> I think it would be just fine to do just one RC
[14:06:28] <gseguin> unless we don't get enough feedback
[14:09:15] <gseguin> toddmparker_: did you jinx it? https://forum.jquery.com/topic/1-1-problems#14737000003094156
[14:10:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's totally fine to do one RC, it would actually be a positive reflection on the framework
[14:12:09] <jzaefferer> johnbender: would you be available for a QUnit meeting, noon EST on Thursday? Wanna get a few people together to review open QUnit issues (just 15 currently): https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues
[14:12:22] <jzaefferer> johnbender: you should also join #jqueryui-dev and #jquery-dev :-)
[14:12:31] <Wilto> It has been uncannily quiet today.
[14:12:57] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I know I should. I should be able to join yah! I'm flattered you'd have me :D
[14:13:10] <johnbender> jzaefferer: should I add that to my canlendar manually or will an invite go out?
[14:13:26] <jzaefferer> johnbender: Cool. Would be good to get your input on the feature tickets you created
[14:13:29] * johnbender goes off to add ui-dev and core dev to his irssi config
[14:13:35] <jzaefferer> I'll add to the jQuery meeting calendar
[14:13:41] <jzaefferer> if you're subscribed to that...?
[14:13:45] <johnbender> jzaefferer: ... newp :(
[14:13:47] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: meeting on thursday sounds good
[14:13:56] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: you are my hero btw
[14:13:59] <johnbender> don't know if you new that
[14:14:03] <johnbender> *knew that
[14:14:03] <DaveMethvin> what did i do?
[14:14:16] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: that defineProperty snippet for property debugging
[14:14:27] <johnbender> super duper snazzy
[14:14:40] <DaveMethvin> wow i don't even remember it
[14:14:56] <DaveMethvin> i just came here to say: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmHeP9Sve48
[14:15:09] <DaveMethvin> you guys are really kicking butt with mobile
[14:15:39] <jzaefferer> johnbender: you should get an invite
[14:15:45] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: thanks!
[14:16:05] <jzaefferer> johnbender: also http://jquery.org/meeting/
[14:16:36] <johnbender> jzaefferer: ahh, very nice!
[14:16:52] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I have accepted and I will be there!
[14:17:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: Wilto: http://throneofjs.com/
[14:17:43] <johnbender> I've volunteered us to participate, assuming that I'll be the one to go
[14:17:46] <johnbender> I hope that's ok
[14:17:55] <Wilto> Yeeees.
[14:17:56] <toddmparker_> thanks DaveMethvin
[14:18:28] <gseguin> johnbender: yes!
[14:18:33] <Wilto> I don’t know what the hell this is, johnbender, but I am into it.
[14:19:01] <Wilto> How do we win it.
[14:27:57] <johnbender> Wilto: I'll go and shame some folks, then they'll remove their own intestines with a short knifesword, and ... profit?
[14:31:06] <toddmparker_> what do we win when we smite all the other frameworks?
[14:31:16] <toddmparker_> prolly a playbook
[14:32:00] <Wilto> “TO CRUSH OTHER FRAMEWORKS, SEE THEM DRIVEN BEFORE YOU, AND HEAR THE LAMENTATIONS OF THEIR DEVELOPERS.”
[14:33:37] <jzaefferer> Wilto: http://soundcloud.com/bassistance/conan-whats-best-in-life
[14:35:01] <Wilto> RE-MIX
[14:37:13] <Wilto> Guys. GUYS. http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-webrtc-opera-mobile-12/
[14:37:20] <johnbender> gseguin: is there any way to compile the css without removing the comments?
[14:37:23] <johnbender> an option
[14:37:27] <johnbender> tbenzige: needs it for TR
[14:39:04] <johnbender> gseguin: wondering if you might be able to help him sort that out while I handle a quick refactor and getting the sha into the cdn output

[15:00:02] <johnbender> alright
[15:00:09] <johnbender> I still haven't eaten or showered after my workout
[15:00:35] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin can you help tbenzige out with a build that retains comments for TR?
[15:00:35] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[15:00:39] <johnbender> tbenzige: ^
[15:01:02] <tbenzige> johnbender: talking to him now. thanks
[15:02:28] <gseguin> hey bot-t, got something for me that I don't already know?
[15:02:28] <bot-t> (1 min 53 secs ago) <johnbender> tell gseguin can you help tbenzige out with a build that retains comments for TR?
[15:02:53] <gseguin> johnbender: I'll work on that tomorrow
[15:03:14] <johnbender> gseguin: tbenzige: yay! Thanks fellas
[15:03:19] <johnbender> let me know what you come up with
[15:03:25] <johnbender> gseguin: the makefile is starting to scare me
[15:03:34] <johnbender> I'm going to have to write tests for it soon :X
[15:03:35] <gseguin> yeah it
[15:03:52] <gseguin> 's kinda complex
[15:04:03] <gseguin> what's the timeframe for grunt?
[15:14:19] <johnbender> gseguin: "in the future"
[15:14:28] <johnbender> though the more I think about it the more I like the idea
[15:14:36] <johnbender> especially given the relatively sane migration path
[15:14:43] <johnbender> the linting
[15:14:49] <johnbender> and the require integration
[15:15:07] <gseguin> I like the future
[15:15:40] <johnbender> it'll also, in my mind at least, make easier to turn our deps into the json output we need for the packages website
[15:15:55] <johnbender> gseguin: maybe I'll start hacking on that this week
[15:16:04] <gseguin> ok
[15:16:41] <johnbender> gseguin: the only thing I'm semi worried about is maintaining the bash scripts for people who don't have node installed
[15:16:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to popup-widget: http://git.io/lSRThw
[15:16:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] Set the hash to current page + &ui-state=dialog so reload will reload the page underneath the popup - Ghislain Seguin
[15:16:53] <johnbender> that is the bash scripts that would be part of the migration to grunt
[15:17:26] <johnbender> bash is on all the *nix workstations out there, where as node isn't
[15:17:26] <gseguin> in the future everyone will have node installed
[15:17:33] <johnbender> gseguin: burn in hell
[15:17:39] <johnbender> :D
[15:17:42] <gseguin> :)
[15:17:42] <johnbender> joking
[15:18:09] <johnbender> on the flip side the poor folks who want to build on windows won't be left out in the cold
[15:18:13] <johnbender> anyway
[15:18:19] <johnbender> to grunt we shall go
[15:18:25] <gseguin> k
[15:18:29] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: ^
[15:18:36] <gseguin> let me know when you start hacking on it
[15:18:39] <johnbender> will do
[15:18:43] <johnbender> I'll push it in a branch
[15:18:44] <gseguin> share the branch
[15:18:46] <gseguin> yep
[15:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> We don't need to support anyone that doesn't have node installed.
[15:21:26] <gseguin> I like that: ^
[15:31:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to popup-widget: http://git.io/e1RzpA
[15:31:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] Kill the vclick event on the overlay to just dismiss the popup and do nothing else - Ghislain Seguin
[15:33:05] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: i am shocked, SHOCKED, that IE would have perf problems ... is that WP 7.5 (the IE9-based version?)
[15:33:48] <toddmparker_> ALL IE 4EVA
[15:35:37] <DaveMethvin> http://9gag.com/gag/2716116
[15:36:13] <toddmparker_> scumbag ie indeed
[15:36:31] <toddmparker_> alright fellas
[15:36:34] <toddmparker_> off to the beach
[15:36:37] <toddmparker_> GO TEAM
[15:36:49] <DaveMethvin> have a great vacation!
[15:36:59] <gseguin> Enjoy your time toddmparker_
[15:49:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: enjoy man!
[15:50:00] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: yah. MS has been sponsoring some work to make it perform a bit better on wp 7 and you can see the difference for a couple of our speed tests
[15:50:15] <DaveMethvin> anything i can help with?
[15:50:25] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: http://jquerymobile.com/speed/stats/visualize/?agent=Windows%20Phone%20OS
[15:50:48] <johnbender> we haven't been keeping up with or perf monitoring unfortunately :(
[15:50:53] <johnbender> *our
[15:51:31] <johnbender> those speedups are from work that kinblas did but we have a few new perf pages that were contributed along with the other work
[15:51:42] <johnbender> so we'll need to start running the devices across those too
[15:51:46] <DaveMethvin> any general things from core that were holding things up? One issue we're planning to tackle in 1.8 is the startup delays, caused by a lot of feature detects
[15:52:25] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: we're just doing a lot of get and set attributes everywhere and I've been meaning to look at $.fn.attr() to see why that makes a difference
[15:53:12] <johnbender> I mean at least part of it is arg checking, the prototype chain, and dereferencing the html elements in the jquery object
[15:53:18] <johnbender> again
[15:53:21] <johnbender> I haven't looked
[15:53:44] <DaveMethvin> i would think we may be able to do some ie9 desktop tests and extrapolate
[15:53:54] <DaveMethvin> our tools are SOOO much better for things like profling
[15:53:57] <DaveMethvin> profiling, even
[15:53:59] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: oooooh you'd make some friends over at MS that's for sure
[15:54:15] <DaveMethvin> do you have a url for some tests?
[15:54:36] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: indeed I do but you have to keep it secret otherwise we'll have the proletariate bombing our test data
[15:54:48] <johnbender> -e
