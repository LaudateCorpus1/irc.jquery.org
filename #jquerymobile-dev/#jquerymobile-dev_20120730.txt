[03:05:28] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Ping
[03:05:56] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: pong
[03:06:21] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: good morning
[03:06:35] <MauriceG> Hi Jasper!  Hope you had a nice weekend!
[03:06:54] <uGoMobi> yeah, was nice.. thanks!
[03:07:46] <MauriceG> I've found an issue on/with collapsibles
[03:08:10] <uGoMobi> tell me
[03:09:22] <MauriceG> If you take a look at http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible.html, all collapsibles with an explicit theme have no hover/mouse down "action".
[03:10:31] <MauriceG> sorry, If they have - no  - explicit theme set ...
[03:10:54] <uGoMobi> I see what you mean
[03:10:57] <uGoMobi> hmm :(
[03:12:43] <MauriceG> for example they get a ui-btn-hover-null  when the mouse is over them
[03:13:17] <uGoMobi> yeah, nice catch!
[03:14:01] <uGoMobi> I was trying to check 1.1.1 to see if it is regression from the changes I made... but jquerymobile.com doesn't load :(
[03:14:23] <uGoMobi> that is... I get an unstyled version
[03:15:35] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: do you know the link to the 1.1.1. docs?
[03:17:06] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/  ?
[03:17:30] <uGoMobi> ah that simple :) thanks
[03:17:58] <uGoMobi> but same problem... does it work for you?
[03:18:32] <MauriceG> it seems, this issue is just raised on collapsibles outside a set btw.
[03:19:08] <uGoMobi> interesting
[03:20:08] <MauriceG> and it seems not to be a regression
[03:23:00] <uGoMobi> you see it in 1.1.1 as well?
[03:23:31] <uGoMobi> so you are able to open 1.1.1... here whole jquerymobile.com is down now
[03:23:45] <MauriceG> yes. just testing a fiddle ...
[03:23:56] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[03:25:40] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I see the issue in the code
[03:26:14] <uGoMobi> The theme has been set to null by default and only when it's a set getInheritedTheme is called
[03:32:21] <MauriceG> Great!
[03:35:21] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  So just a call to $.mobile.getInheritedTheme is missing if option: theme is null?
[03:36:15] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yes... just added it
[03:36:22] <MauriceG> cool
[03:40:40] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/docs/content/content-collapsible.html is up again
[03:40:52] <uGoMobi> ah great!

[03:54:47] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: thanks for finding the bug :)
[03:58:12] <MauriceG> are the popup changes in the docs ready ?
[03:58:18] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: ^
[03:58:31] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: no
[03:58:52] <MauriceG> it was part of your last commit
[03:59:24] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I wanted to push that collapsible fix, but had already made changes and was about to mess up things in my local git
[03:59:46] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: so I already pushed a part
[04:01:14] <MauriceG> I just saw: If you're at http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html  and change to options, the page loading widget menu entry is "lost"
[04:01:39] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Sorry for disturbing ...
[04:02:04] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: it's ok :)
[04:18:59] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: next interruption :-|  How would you solve: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4751 ?  another option for the expanded heading?
[04:19:00] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4751 on jquery-mobile (Sathis; 4d, 2h ago): Adding Multiple Header Title for Collapsible Widget
[04:20:56] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: it should be possible by offering a class that can be added in the markup to the substitute (expand) header
[04:21:10] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: not sure if I am in favor of this
[04:22:04] <uGoMobi> that won't be semantically  correct
[04:23:25] <uGoMobi> better would be to create an option to set "header collapsed text" and "header expanded text"
[04:23:52] <uGoMobi> can be confusing for a user though
[04:24:09] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: what do you think? useful?

[06:43:05] <toddparker> Morning all
[06:43:40] <toddparker> Just joined on my phone and can't see history so lemme know if I need to see anything
[06:44:43] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: I just forwarded a forum message
[06:44:46] <toddparker> I know that jquery 1.2 has still not officially been released, but I cannot get the popupbeforeposition event is not triggered. The popup works fine but the popupbeforeposition binding doesn't.
[06:48:59] <toddparker_> I'd like to start getting ready for 1.2
[06:49:21] <toddparker> johnbender: Do you have time today to do a build?
[06:49:34] <toddparker> agcolom: I'll need your help to get the docs ready
[06:49:43] <toddparker> Im working on a blog post
[06:50:28] <toddparker> Realistically, if we got the docs ready then did the build by late today, I'll announce tomorrow morning
[06:51:09] <toddparker> Things looked good in our testing Friday
[06:51:18] <toddparker> I'll have Andrew do another pass today
[06:57:15] <Wilto> ’Morning, guys.
[08:26:18] <toddparker> hey all
[08:31:50] <MauriceG> toddparker:   Hi Todd!
[08:41:17] <MauriceG> toddparker: We've found an issue on collapsibles today, that they don't react on mouse hover/up/down events when they had no theme set.
[08:42:23] <MauriceG> The issue-machine alias uGoMobi fixed it before an issue was raised at github.  New record :-)
[08:47:38] <toddparker> thanks MauriceG
[08:47:48] <toddparker> theme=none
[08:47:58] <toddparker> or just inherited theme
[08:48:05] <toddparker> sorry, popping out for lunch
[08:48:09] <toddparker> be back in about an hour

[10:26:31] <agcolom> johnbender: Hi, my understanding is that chaining of popups is not allowed... (see note at the bottom of http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html)
[10:30:46] <agcolom> toddparker: I'm here, so happy to help... just let me know when you're back from lunch...
[10:43:00] <johnbender> agcolom: alright, we'd better respond to that one then
[10:45:43] <johnbender> agcolom: do we have docs in about the popup events?
[10:45:57] <agcolom> johnbender: not sure... checking...
[10:45:58] * johnbender assumes we are still triggering popup events so people can do their own chaining
[10:46:12] <johnbender> agcolom: I don't see it in the widget page which is why I ask

[10:47:44] <johnbender> agcolom: yah it's in there

[11:14:54] <gseguin> but it's out there
[11:15:03] <johnbender> gseguin: right
[11:15:07] <johnbender> time to deprecate
[11:15:12] <gseguin> yep
[11:15:24] <johnbender> I'm going to do that super quick
[11:15:33] <gseguin> k
[11:15:38] <johnbender> well

[11:16:06] <gseguin> sounds good
[11:16:35] <johnbender> agcolom: I'm silly, the events are in the docs
[11:16:36] <johnbender> :/
[11:16:44] <johnbender> forgot about the "tabs"
[11:18:20] <agcolom> johnbender: oh... nice then ;-)
[11:19:51] <agcolom> johnbender: thx for letting me know...
[11:23:46] <johnbender> gseguin: the convention else where is to provide events for added elements not to provide the elements themselves
[11:23:59] <johnbender> gseguin: so we should just add it to the event and fire early I guess
[11:24:29] <johnbender> good enough™

[11:54:30] <toddparker> at least that's what i've been saying

[11:57:15] <toddparker> 1.2.0-alpha?
[11:57:29] <toddparker> as far as docs URL, JS and CSS sufffix
[11:57:37] <toddparker> agcolom: needs that to change the docs
[11:57:51] <agcolom> yes, will do that after dinner this evening.
[11:59:53] <agcolom> just let me know the syntax once it is confirmed.

[13:12:40] <agcolom> johnbender: toddparker: in the past, we had 1.0a1 1.0a2 1.0a3 1.0a4 1.0a4.1 etc... so will it be 1.2.0-alpha 1.2.0a or something else?
[13:16:35] <toddparker> agcolom: good Q
[13:16:48] <toddparker> does semver have "opinions" here
[13:17:29] <toddparker> 1.8 beta
[13:17:30] <toddparker> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8b1.js
[13:17:47] <toddparker> so 1.2a1?
[13:17:58] <toddparker> johnbender - that seem good?
[13:18:34] <toddparker> and we don't use the 1.2.0b1syntax until final? confused a bit there
[13:21:35] <agcolom> I like 1.2a1, 1.2a (if there is no further alpha), 1.2.0a1 or 1.2.0a (if there is no further alpha)
[13:22:37] <johnbender> toddparker: any reason we can't just to 1.2.0-alpha.1?
[13:22:42] <johnbender> doesn't matter to me either way
[13:22:57] <johnbender> the a follows the old convention at least
[13:24:22] <johnbender> toddparker: semver uses alpha/beta
[13:24:25] <johnbender> in the examples at least
[13:28:08] <agcolom> I was just wondering whether http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0-alpha.1/jquery.mobile-1.2.0-alpha.1.min.js would mean too many '-' but actually it makes it quite clear, so I don't mind either
[13:31:16] <agcolom> I like the 1 after the alpha, whether we go for a or alpha.
[13:35:57] <agcolom> toddparker: when is alpha going out? (today? tomorrow?)
[13:48:48] <toddparker> tomorrow if we can
[13:49:45] <agcolom> ok. Can we agree on the syntax so I can do the docs?? (nearly 10pm here ;-) )
[13:49:45] <toddparker> i'm just trying to keep with conventions
[13:50:00] <toddparker> let's do a1 - sounds good?
[13:50:05] <agcolom> ok
[13:50:08] <toddparker> think that's consistent
[13:50:11] <agcolom> 1.2a1?
[13:50:19] <agcolom> or 1.2.0a1?
[14:05:17] <agcolom> toddparker: johnbender ^
[14:14:16] <agcolom> toddparker: how do we refer to this version in text? 1.2 alpha 1 or 1.2 alpha?
[14:15:32] <agcolom> or do we just say 1.2a1?
[14:15:59] <agcolom> see the paragraph just above the code here http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html
[14:21:41] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Sorry for delay. May we can look later at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4767#issuecomment-7376771  --  select-popup calls dialog programmatic - calls select-popup. The first popup is never closed, the second breaks jqm
[14:21:52] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4767 on jquery-mobile (ninichki; 13h, 1s ago): Starting Dialog from Select and then open a Select don't work
[14:23:37] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: the issue is closed, but this seems like a bug to me.... opening a dialog from a custom select is not chaining a popup, or am I wrong?
[14:24:39] <uGoMobi> but it becomes chaining a popup if the first is not closed yet as you described
[14:25:37] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yes, let's look at this later
[14:29:20] <agcolom> toddparker: johnbender ok, I am going for 1.2a1 (syntax) and "1.2 alpha (1.2a1)" in description paragraph. I'll be around until 11pm (another 30 mins) today, and can change things early tomorrow morning if need be, from around 8am (London time)

[14:41:04] <johnbender> agcolom: I'm going to ask what the core and ui folks do
[14:41:47] <agcolom> johnbender: ok, cool! thanks
[14:42:08] <agcolom> johnbender: not a problem for me to change things...
[14:42:47] <johnbender> agcolom: 1.2.0-a.1 looks odd
[14:42:53] <johnbender> there does have to be a dash
[14:42:57] <johnbender> just read that
[14:43:02] <agcolom> johnbender: ok
[14:43:22] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: kk, semver says that it has to be a dash then the specifier so it looks odd with just the letter I guess
[14:45:02] <agcolom> johnbender: I agree with you 1.2.0-a.1 looks odd.
[14:46:43] <agcolom> johnbender: 1.2.0-alpha.1 or 1.2-alpha.1?
[14:48:23] <agcolom> johnbender: ok, so 1.2.0-alpha.1?
[14:48:28] <johnbender> agcolom: we have to include the patch versiopn
[14:48:30] <johnbender> yah
[14:48:42] <johnbender> 1.2.0-alpha.1
[14:48:55] <agcolom> Cool! great... changing that now.
[14:49:02] <johnbender> thanks
[14:49:58] <agcolom> johnbender: how about in the paragraph of text? is it ok to say 1.2 alpha (1.2.0-alpha.1) or should I just say 1.2.0-alpha.1? see the paragraph just above the code here http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html
[14:50:19] <johnbender> agcolom: whichever reads better
[14:50:24] <johnbender> up to you
[14:50:58] <agcolom> ok, I like 1.2 alpha (1.2.0-alpha.1) better as this is how I would refer to this version...

[15:01:46] <agcolom> johnbender: I'm done :-)
[15:03:02] <johnbender> agcolom: nice!
[15:03:50] <mattkime> where in the codebase does it determine whether a flip switch or a slider is rendered?
[15:04:35] <mattkime> i'm trying to integrate with emberjs and i'm getting a slider where i want a flip switch. i suspect that jQM might not like the markup ember is creating
[15:06:52] <uGoMobi> mattkime: a slider is an input element with type="range"
[15:07:27] <uGoMobi> mattkime: a flip-toggle switch is a select element with two options plus data-role="slider"
[15:07:56] <mattkime> pppfft….you're right. not slider, but select
[15:09:00] <uGoMobi> mattkime: then it's the data-role="slider" attribute that determines it's a flip toggle switch
[15:09:18] <uGoMobi> mattkime: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/switch/
[15:10:47] <mattkime> where in the codebase does it determine which one to render? i took a look at slider.js but judging by the div element i was handed its already done some dom manipulation
[15:12:50] <uGoMobi> mattkime: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/slider.js#L19
[15:13:29] <mattkime> perfect, thanks!
[15:13:46] <uGoMobi> you're welcome
[15:24:44] <johnbender> toddparker: the code is deployed to the cdn but the demos are stalled on a permissions issue
[15:24:53] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll let you know when I hear back about changing it
[15:26:10] <toddparker> ok, so the CSS and JS are up but demos/ for this is broken?
[15:26:19] <toddparker> johnbender ^
[15:28:07] <toddparker> i wonder ig you and agcolom used different names
[15:28:14] <toddparker> she has this in the code
[15:28:15] <toddparker> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0-alpha.1/jquery.mobile-1.2.0-alpha.1.min.css
[15:29:54] <toddparker> johnbender: when you get the demos, zip, css, and js up on the can, mind posting message to BC with links to each?
[15:36:30] <agcolom> toddparker: I'm still here... are these docs changes ok?
[15:37:29] <agcolom> toddparker: i have made these changes but the build is not there yet... Is that what you are referring to?
[15:39:42] <agcolom> toddparker: johnbender: bedtime for me... Please let me know if I need to change anything. I'll be back online in 8h...
[15:40:00] <agcolom> (well, email me if I need to be ;-) )
[15:42:58] <johnbender> agcolom: cool!
[17:38:27] <johnbender> toddparker: some minor irregularities with the build that I'll have to finish sorting out tomorrow
[17:38:49] <johnbender> ?tell toddparker some minor irregularities with the build that I'll have to finish sorting out tomorrow
[19:43:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/nMSVVQ
[19:43:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added more emphasis for advanced example button, fixed typo - toddparker
[20:44:58] <toddmparker_> ok all, i'll wait for the build oddness to get fixed up. bender - i made a quick doc fix tonight anyway.
