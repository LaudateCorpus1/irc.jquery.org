[00:34:16] <_|Nix|_> wingy: Look at the original commit.
[00:35:17] <wingy> _|Nix|_: seems like you have a name already
[00:35:47] <_|Nix|_> wingy: I don't understand.
[00:35:52] <wingy> and i am curious about knowing more .. who? why? when?
[00:36:29] <wingy> wanna know who was the original force behind JQM
[00:36:57] <wingy> you could say the jquery foundation, but then who? why? when?
[00:40:41] <_|Nix|_> wingy: I don't know enough to help you, but toddmparker_ most likely does.
[00:40:49] <wingy> ok thx
[00:41:47] <_|Nix|_> wingy: You can obtain his email address from the commits he has submitted.
[00:42:00] <wingy> _|Nix|_: i c
[00:42:08] <_|Nix|_> wingy: For example, git show db11e2b3ee16c3bbf1907bd66bae78364c446e87
[00:42:09] <wingy> ill wait for him to appear here :)
[00:42:12] <wingy> ah

[07:41:35] <gseguin> morning all
[07:48:09] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin
[09:00:25] <johnbender> kinblas: you around?
[09:00:37] <kinblas> johnbender: nope
[09:00:38] <kinblas> :-)
[09:00:46] <kinblas> johnbender: whassup!
[09:00:57] <johnbender> kinblas: I know you wrote a quick plugin to handle the params with hashes
[09:01:03] <johnbender> eg, #foo?bar=baz
[09:01:15] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm just going to fix that
[09:01:18] <johnbender> tired of dealing with it
[09:01:25] <kinblas> johnbender: ugh I just realized I have a meeting right now ... give he 30 minutes and we'll pick it up
[09:01:29] <johnbender> do we need to do anything other than strip it from the dataUrl?
[09:01:32] <johnbender> kinblas: kk
[09:01:33] <johnbender> sounds good
[09:01:37] <kinblas> sorry
[09:01:42] <johnbender> kinblas: no worries
[09:01:46] <johnbender> kinblas: ping me when you get back
[09:07:35] <Wilto> johnbender: Awesome presentation, dude.
[09:11:06] <Wilto> Shout-out to my favorite bug at 00:12:00.
[09:20:10] <gseguin> yay for johnbender! Very nice presentation!
[09:22:12] <kinblas> johnbender: back ... what presentation? :-)
[09:23:43] <johnbender> gseguin: thanks guy
[09:23:46] <agcolom> kinblas: Hi :-) here it is http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mobile-Web-Development
[09:23:51] <johnbender> kinblas: the recording of my throne presentation went up
[09:23:54] <johnbender> OHMAN
[09:23:58] <johnbender> and they have my slides this timne
[09:24:06] <johnbender> all I had to do was convert them to images quickly
[09:24:09] <johnbender> it was trivial too
[09:24:16] <agcolom> (I'm watching as we speak.... )
[09:24:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you around
[09:24:25] <johnbender> kinblas: one sec
[09:24:45] <agcolom> johnbender: hope it was ok to share!
[09:24:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: what directory are you using for initial page state tests
[09:24:51] <johnbender> agcolom: of course
[09:24:54] <kinblas> johnbender: "The Horror"
[09:24:55] <johnbender> I'm glad it's available
[09:24:57] <johnbender> kinblas: :)
[09:24:58] <kinblas> lol
[09:25:44] <kinblas> johnbender: so about that plugin question
[09:25:53] <johnbender> kinblas: yes
[09:25:58] <kinblas> johnbender: you talking about this? https://github.com/jblas/jquery-mobile-plugins/blob/master/page-params/jqm.page.params.js
[09:26:39] <johnbender> kinblas: ah, I see that you retain the data url as an extra bit of data
[09:27:02] <johnbender> we probably don't have to do that ourselves do we?
[09:27:19] <johnbender> that is, it's just a convenience
[09:27:28] <johnbender> they could get that information themselves from the location object
[09:28:19] <kinblas> johnbender: the point of that plugin was to allow them to set the location but use an existing page
[09:28:43] <kinblas> if the hash is unique, we don't see that the page exists ... because the data-url doesn't match
[09:28:46] <kinblas> so we create a new page
[09:29:19] <johnbender> for embedded page refs?
[09:29:36] <johnbender> kinblas: I thought it would just load the first page
[09:29:46] <kinblas> what folks were trying to do was use the same internal page
[09:29:54] <kinblas> but change the contents based on their query params
[09:30:05] <johnbender> right
[09:30:10] <kinblas> they didn't want to create new pages
[09:30:47] <johnbender> if they do that now does it short circuit before any of the events fire?
[09:30:53] <johnbender> as a no-op?
[09:30:59] <johnbender> or would it simply not find the page?
[09:31:12] <kinblas> johnbender: because it hooks in before any of the changePage processing
[09:31:14] <kinblas> kicks in
[09:31:21] <kinblas> it pre-processes stuff
[09:31:27] <johnbender> the plugin does
[09:31:30] <johnbender> I'm asking about jqm
[09:31:31] <kinblas> yes
[09:31:36] <johnbender> if you can recall
[09:31:41] <johnbender> paging in from disk there I know
[09:32:16] <kinblas> I guess I don't understand the question
[09:32:24] <johnbender> kinblas: hmm let me rephrase
[09:32:34] <johnbender> kinblas: can't I just stript the query params from our handling
[09:32:40] <johnbender> convertUrlToDataUrl
[09:32:47] <johnbender> can't that just strip the params?
[09:33:34] <kinblas> johnbender: hmmm, that assumes they want that single page behavior
[09:33:50] <johnbender> what do you mean?
[09:33:57] <johnbender> it could be any embedded hash
[09:35:17] <kinblas> johnbender:  well, I guess the flaw in what I just said was that if the user attempts to load #page-1?foo=bar
[09:35:41] <kinblas> it will attempt to load it off disk (creating a new page) but we currently only load the first page in the file
[09:36:12] <kinblas> all I was saying was by stripping the queryparams we're assuming they don't want that disk loading (new page) behavior
[09:36:22] <johnbender> ah
[09:36:28] <kinblas> if that's ok ... then go for it
[09:36:32] <johnbender> they could use a link like
[09:36:43] <johnbender> /foo/bar#hash?baz=bak
[09:36:51] <kinblas> yeah
[09:36:52] <johnbender> is that what you mean?
[09:36:53] <gseguin> hey guys we have an issue with out native app (PhoneGap wrapped) where there is flash of the background color when scrolling
[09:37:10] <johnbender> kinblas: that's a different issue it seems like
[09:37:28] <kinblas> gseguin: isn't that the delayed rendering for the browser as it exposes new areas? Or something different?
[09:37:28] <gseguin> we've been banging our heads against the wall for a few days now
[09:37:46] <johnbender> gseguin: ugh
[09:37:52] <gseguin> really I have no idea
[09:38:05] <kinblas> johnbender: I would make that a config behavior ... so we don't break any existing apps
[09:38:13] <kinblas> that rely on the behavior .. that's my only concern
[09:38:32] <johnbender> kinblas: rely on which
[09:38:35] <gseguin> putting -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden on .ui-page fixes the problem but causes the app to crash
[09:38:39] <johnbender> right now it's strait broken
[09:38:41] <kinblas> johnbender: but are you going to still pass the queryparams so the apps have access to it after the page is switched?
[09:38:41] <gseguin> so not really a solution
[09:39:04] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah, that causes the entire page image to be cached which is  a memory pig
[09:39:38] <johnbender> kinblas: I don't want to alter any links or requests to the server
[09:39:46] <gseguin> I'm at a loss, any idea or leads that I should explore?
[09:39:48] <kinblas> johnbender: I meant about relying on the new page behavior that exists today
[09:39:48] <johnbender> I just want to load the correct embedded page when the link is to an embedded page
[09:39:59] <gseguin> anybody has had to deal with that issue?
[09:40:19] <johnbender> kinblas: yah it'll just load the first page in the new document
[09:40:22] <johnbender> I'm not going to tackle that
[09:40:25] <kinblas> gseguin: the page height exceeds 1024px right?
[09:40:28] <johnbender> (if that's what you're asking)
[09:40:47] <gseguin> hmm I'm guessing so
[09:40:53] <gseguin> yes
[09:41:17] <gseguin> this happens only on iOS6
[09:41:55] <kinblas> johnbender: the video never shows your slides?
[09:42:11] <gseguin> kinblas: it's right below the video
[09:42:16] <johnbender> kinblas: nope, you have to watch it on infoq and the slides change on the page
[09:42:22] <johnbender> kinblas: did I get that right
[09:42:38] <kinblas> johnbender: gseguin: ah ok I was full screen video
[09:42:44] <johnbender> kinblas: you were asking if I was gonig to leave the "load the first page of a new document only" in place
[09:43:12] <kinblas> johnbender: no I know you wont' touch that
[09:43:14] <kinblas> what I meant was
[09:43:20] <kinblas> you are going to change the behavior such that
[09:43:25] <kinblas> if someone loads 2 pages
[09:43:33] <kinblas> #page-1?foo=bar
[09:43:39] <kinblas> #page-1?baz=bak
[09:43:46] <kinblas> that they won't get 2 pages in the DOM
[09:43:52] <kinblas> there will only be one
[09:43:54] <kinblas> page-1
[09:44:29] <johnbender> hmm
[09:44:39] <johnbender> I guess that's the assumption
[09:44:47] <johnbender> I was assuming I could just treat that as an embedded page
[09:44:48] <kinblas> johnbender: dang my screen isn't tall enough to see the video and slides :-) I can only see hands waving while I look at slides
[09:44:55] <johnbender> you can do it horizontally
[09:45:00] <johnbender> there are option up and to the right
[09:45:51] <kinblas> johnbender: ah ... now I can enjoy both :-)
[09:46:07] <kinblas> johnbender: btw, love the topic
[09:46:45] <johnbender> kinblas: lol
[09:49:02] <johnbender> kinblas: given that we don't support referencing hashes in external links, and that the query param is supposed to come before the hash
[09:49:43] <johnbender> can't we always assume that #foo?bar=baz is a embedded page ref if #foo is in the document?
[09:50:38] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah, but the question is, will you make bar=baz available to the user ... and display that URL in the location
[09:51:10] <johnbender> kinblas: I hadn't planned on changing the url
[09:51:21] <johnbender> only stripping it for looking for an embedded page
[09:51:26] <johnbender> and for setting the data url
[09:51:31] <kinblas> johnbender: ok yeah
[09:51:35] <kinblas> that sounds like a plan
[09:51:40] <johnbender> kinblas: cool
[09:51:42] <johnbender> kinblas: thanks so much man
[09:51:52] <johnbender> your expansive intellect is such an amazing tool :)
[09:51:54] <kinblas> johnbender: np, sorry for the round and round
[09:51:57] <johnbender> kinblas: no no
[09:51:59] <johnbender> that's the point
[09:52:05] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah I've been called a tool once or twice
[09:52:13] <johnbender> it forced me to think about the semantics of #foo?bar=baz
[09:52:19] <johnbender> kinblas: hahah
[09:52:23] <johnbender> kinblas: not what I meant :)
[09:52:24] <kinblas> :-)
[09:57:45] * gseguin builds up a test case to share it with you guys
[09:59:19] <uGoMobi> johnbender: just watched your preso... really awesome!
[10:05:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi: many thanks!
[10:06:19] <mspisars> johnbender... or anyone else, is there a way to build jqm not to do anything or listen to any navigation events? yet keep the page rendering?
[10:06:43] <johnbender> mspisars: you can turn off hashlistening and pushstate
[10:06:56] <mspisars> as a config option?
[10:06:56] <johnbender> and one other thing
[10:06:58] <johnbender> old on
[10:06:58] <johnbender> yah
[10:07:28] <johnbender> mspisars: $.mobile.linkBindingEnabled
[10:07:38] <johnbender> $.mobile.hashListeningEnabled
[10:07:44] <johnbender> $.mobile.pushStateEnabled
[10:07:51] <johnbender> double check those in the docs
[10:07:58] <johnbender> mspisars: I think that will get you what you want
[10:08:09] <mspisars> looking up, you possibly saved me a headache
[10:08:22] <johnbender> mspisars: great I hope that will work
[10:08:40] <johnbender> mspisars: it sounds like you just want link to behave like normal links
[10:08:45] <johnbender> *links
[10:08:49] <mspisars> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[10:08:53] <johnbender> yah
[10:09:05] <mspisars> no, I want JQM to act like the skin class in Flex/Flash
[10:09:20] <mspisars> and ember.js with its router to do the heavy lifting
[10:10:07] <mspisars> so JQM takes care of the skin layer, while I handle my MVC stuff in ember...
[10:10:33] <johnbender> mspisars: ah, I hae something that might help
[10:10:42] <mspisars> i am all ears
[10:10:48] <mspisars> er... eyes
[10:10:58] <johnbender> mspisars:
[10:10:59] <johnbender> http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/03/using-backbone-js-with-jquery-mobile/
[10:11:07] <johnbender> take a look at the settings
[10:11:18] <johnbender> hopefully the routers aren't too differen
[10:11:44] <johnbender> mspisars: that's an article on using backbones router instead of jqms
[10:11:57] <mspisars> i think i just peed myself
[10:12:14] <johnbender> cook
[10:12:16] <mspisars> yeah, that is what i wanted, but i always searched for ember not backbone...
[10:12:17] <johnbender> *cool
[10:12:21] <mspisars> thank yoU!
[10:12:24] <mspisars> you!
[10:12:24] <johnbender> mspisars: lol understandably
[10:12:25] <johnbender> lol
[10:12:37] <johnbender> np np good luck
[10:16:24] <kinblas> johnbender: lol .. loved that parting msg
[10:16:40] <kinblas> ... the tie into the post-man
[10:18:31] <gseguin> yeah that was pretty awesome :)
[10:24:56] <uGoMobi> that message gave me the feeling I am contributing to world peace while developing :)
[10:29:49] <mspisars> johnbender: the backbone + jqm example says $.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false;
[10:30:11] <mspisars> but i am wondering if that only affects how pages are loaded
[10:33:08] <johnbender> mspisars: I foreget exactly why all that is necessary but it is
[10:33:15] <johnbender> I worked with him on getting that right
[10:33:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://blog.aldomatic.com/facebook-style-slide-out-menu-in-jquery-mobile/
[10:33:33] <johnbender> demo is nice
[10:35:30] <mspisars> doing some testing still.
[10:35:40] <mspisars> my main issue is that custom select menu's
[10:35:48] <mspisars> will for some reason redirect to the # hash
[10:36:21] <johnbender> mspisars: which version of jqm are you using?
[10:36:25] <mspisars> and when I looked at the download-builder for jqm
[10:36:28] <mspisars> 1.2 rc2
[11:11:19] <johnbender> mspisars: ok
[11:11:27] <johnbender> then the select menu's are using the popup plugin
[11:11:54] <johnbender> you can disable the history alteration for all popups if you want
[11:12:04] <johnbender> and consequently select menus
[11:12:42] <johnbender> $( document ).on( "mobileinit", function(){ $.mobile.popup.prorotype.options.history = false; });
[11:12:45] <johnbender> mspisars: ^
[11:13:11] <mspisars> ahh... that's probably the last bit that I need.
[11:13:39] <mspisars> but I would think that if the global hash tracking/history is disabled then the widgets would also be disabled?
[11:13:54] <mspisars> widget history**
[11:13:54] <johnbender> hmm it should be
[11:13:58] <johnbender> let me check something
[11:14:29] <johnbender> mspisars: it is
[11:14:44] <johnbender> if you disable ajaxEnabled or hashListening it should disable the hashchange
[11:14:47] <johnbender> is it not?
[11:14:49] <mspisars> i am very close, and this is the clearest path that I've seen so far, so I am sure that I might have some of my legacy crap getting in the way
[11:15:25] <mspisars> this is not a new app, I think some of the stuff that is firing is custom, so might be a good time to rip out some old baggage
[11:15:33] <johnbender> mspisars: ok let me know
[11:15:39] <johnbender> but you are correct
[11:15:47] <johnbender> we disable the hash management when either of those two options are set
[11:15:50] <johnbender> err
[11:15:52] <johnbender> set to false
[11:16:49] <mspisars> yeah, that would make most sence, baced on my debugging it looks like my guess was accurate, I have some events fire that are causing my issue
[11:17:06] <mspisars> thanks for all the help so far!
[11:17:18] <mspisars> i'm sure I will find something else to ask...
[11:17:42] <johnbender> mspisars: no problem
[11:17:53] <johnbender> mspisars: normally I don't troubleshoot in the -dev channel
[11:17:57] <johnbender> but your use case is of interest to me
[11:19:25] <toddmparker_> listening to johnbender's talk
[11:19:29] <toddmparker_> this is awesome
[11:19:39] <toddmparker_> btw -you should see teh new kindle fire hd
[11:19:53] <toddmparker_> position fixed and transitons are so bad
[11:20:06] <toddmparker_> based on 4.0!
[11:20:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: good to know
[11:21:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did you see that link the slideout menu?
[11:21:05] <johnbender> actually pretty nice
[11:21:12] <johnbender> not sure how that works with transitions but slick
[11:21:14] <toddmparker_> looking at the code now
[11:21:32] <toddmparker_> i like that it keeps it simple by animating the margin
[11:21:47] <toddmparker_> others use overflow and it gets wacko
[11:22:01] <toddmparker_>     $('.pages').live("swiperight", function () {
[11:22:01] <toddmparker_>         if (!menuStatus) {
[11:22:01] <toddmparker_>             $(".ui-page-active").animate({
[11:22:01] <toddmparker_>                 marginLeft: "165px",
[11:22:01] <toddmparker_>             }, 300, function () {
[11:22:01] <toddmparker_>                 menuStatus = true
[11:22:01] <toddmparker_>             });
[11:22:02] <toddmparker_>         }
[11:22:02] <toddmparker_>     });
[11:22:13] <toddmparker_> not using css animations which will be faster
[11:22:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes there's a lot wrong wit it
[11:22:49] <johnbender> the .pages thing is silly
[11:23:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I guess the point is you could do that same thing with way less code
[11:23:09] <johnbender> also you could handle nav better
[11:23:22] <mspisars> johnbender: our goal is to eventually replace a flex app (enterprise) with a html5 app
[11:23:31] <johnbender> mspisars: interesting
[11:23:37] <johnbender> you'd have fans if you post a retro on that
[11:23:44] <johnbender> especially if it involves ember
[11:23:57] <johnbender> though the HN crowd doesn't like jqm
[11:23:58] <johnbender> :/
[11:24:02] <toddmparker_> the swipe to open/close seems to die after a few swipes
[11:24:08] <toddmparker_> hope that's not a bug in our code
[11:24:20] <toddmparker_> but this is the type of menu i'd like to offer asa demo
[11:24:22] <mspisars> i know, I hope I can at least post a shell of the base app or something before the end of the year...
[11:24:46] <toddmparker_> that would be great mspisars
[11:24:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I suspect it has to do with the "mutex" he has in there
[11:25:11] <Wilto> “though the HN crows doesn’t like anything”
[11:25:13] <Wilto> FTFY.
[11:25:15] <toddmparker_> can't tell what's happening with the JS
[11:25:21] <Wilto> crowd. Actually, “crows” sorta works.
[11:25:21] <mspisars> toddmparker_: on my android 4.+ chrome browser the if i swipe left/right a bunch of times, then it takes a while to scroll up or down.
[11:25:25] <toddmparker_> there is app.js which looks like the menu
[11:25:32] <toddmparker_> but there are tabs.js too
[11:25:47] <toddmparker_> hmm, i need to test this more
[11:25:55] <toddmparker_> but generally, this is a helpful pattern
[11:25:58] <johnbender> yes
[11:26:02] <Wilto> We could totally do this.
[11:26:04] <johnbender> yah
[11:26:05] <johnbender> with easy
[11:26:08] <johnbender> *ease
[11:26:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/AzBsVA
[11:26:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (popup): mini back button - Jasper de Groot
[11:26:16] <toddmparker_> scott jehl was working on a menu that slides over too
[11:26:22] <toddmparker_> be cool to have both demos
[11:26:29] <toddmparker_> and use one in the new docs
[11:26:51] <mspisars> i thought jqm 1.2 had that with the popup feature already in the demos?
[11:26:56] <mspisars> toddmparker_ ^
[11:27:04] <johnbender> mspisars: this one slides the page over
[11:27:09] <johnbender> the popup is just a hud menu
[11:27:24] <mspisars> yeah, my mistake
[11:31:18] <Wilto> Im’ma prototype something.
[11:31:23] <Wilto> All opposed?
[11:31:32] <toddmparker_> nay
[11:31:41] <toddmparker_> fun toy to work on :)
[11:31:45] <Horse_ebooks> Neigh.
[11:31:51] <Wilto> Okay, on it.
[11:37:50] <toddmparker_> mspisars: there is a popup which is intended to make overlay windows - tooltips, menu, mini-dialogs
[11:38:05] <toddmparker_> this work differently - it pushes the page over
[11:38:26] <toddmparker_> there is an advanced demo uGoMobi made that turns the popup into an overlay panel of sort
[11:38:45] <mspisars> yeah, i looked at the demo, it is overlayed with opacity of .6 or something.
[11:38:51] <mspisars> not quite FB like
[11:38:59] <toddmparker_> nope
[11:39:14] <mspisars> or not at all like FB app
[11:39:42] <toddmparker_> Wilto is working on a proto that allows you to make a panel on the top/left/right that either pushes content over/down or overlays it
[11:39:51] <toddmparker_> we need it for a client app
[11:39:53] <Wilto> Gonna be fresh to death.
[11:40:00] <mspisars> my main concern with moving the whole page over is that in my case the page content is a pretty complex ember view.
[11:40:13] <mspisars> so it seems to be very jumpy
[11:40:22] <Wilto> ?mlm
[11:40:23] <bot-t> much like myself
[11:40:45] <mspisars> i didn't even bother testing on the Android stock browser, but on chrome for android, it was still glitchy.
[11:40:57] <mspisars> ?NL
[11:41:00] <bot-t> mspisars, .text() - Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[11:41:01] <Wilto> There are definitely ways we could smooth it out, especially considering all the work that went into getting the jQM transitions silky smoove.
[11:41:20] <mspisars> i didn't even know about bot-t
[11:42:35] <toddmparker_> pushing the page over/down will always be a lot chunkier because of the re-draws
[11:42:47] <toddmparker_> sliding a menu over will be smoother there
[11:43:13] <mspisars> yes, it's not as bad on a simple page, but with listviews and accordians with form elements in each list item.
[11:43:16] <mspisars> gets ugly
[11:43:19] <toddmparker_> the original code used jQuery to animate margins which is a bad thing, perf-wise
[11:43:28] <toddmparker_> we don't use any JS animations on mobile
[11:43:33] <mspisars> oh
[11:43:47] <mspisars> what is used in jqm for animations?
[11:43:53] <toddmparker_> CSS is usually hardware accelerated (to varying degrees)
[11:43:59] <toddmparker_> CSS keyframe animations
[11:44:24] <toddmparker_> if they look bad on some platforms, that is just how they accelerate (or don't)
[11:45:02] <mspisars> i was looking at the demo with the jquery animate
[11:52:49] <toddmparker_> johnbender - thoughts on this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2228
[11:53:13] <toddmparker_> should we add it to the roadmap somewhere? feel free to tack it in if you think it's a good idea
[11:53:32] <toddmparker_> also: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5103
[11:54:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I don't see what value that provides over the event structure other than confining it to a single call
[11:55:26] <johnbender> I can see merging in params
[11:55:54] <johnbender> I mean we support an args object there so we might have to do a nested data property
[11:58:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the second link makes sense
[11:58:55] <johnbender> just need to pass along the options object to each even
[11:59:09] <johnbender> though that has issues in terms of backward compat
[12:08:40] <toddmparker_> mind commenting on each and either tag as a feature request or won't fix?
[12:08:43] <toddmparker_> (and close)
[12:08:55] <johnbender> doing so now
[12:50:34] <toddmparker_> thanks
[12:50:53] <toddmparker_> johnbender: did you do a test deploy for tyler?
[12:51:07] <toddmparker_> looking like we'll have to release on Monday late or Tuesday
[13:32:02] <agcolom> Hi, anyone around? _|Nix|_ ?
[13:32:39] <agcolom> I have a popup question.... actually just wanted to clarify something on the page http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/methods.html
[13:35:52] <agcolom> np will catch you later....
[13:46:30] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What's up?
[13:48:19] <agcolom> _|Nix|_:hi! I am deep into the api doc and currently finalising popups
[13:49:23] <agcolom> Now, when I looked at the open method and its options, I wondered whether x and y were still genuine options and if they were, what happens if x and y are specified as well as positionTo
[13:50:31] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: positionTo takes precedence.
[13:50:57] <agcolom> ok. Thanks.
[13:51:17] <agcolom> and is it possible to just specify either x or y?
[13:51:38] <agcolom> (and what are the default values for x and y)
[13:52:03] <agcolom> (sorry the api doc has to follow a very strict template...)
[14:01:48] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: IIRC, if either x or y is missing, it will be replaced by the middle of the window.
[14:02:17] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, if you only specify x, the y will be the middle of the window, and vice versa.
[14:09:26] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Perfect! All makes sense now :-) Thank you v much again and have a fab weekend!
[14:11:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: NP. You too!
[14:13:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: its posted yes
[14:26:36] <toddmparker_> thanks johnbender
