[02:08:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good morning Anne, I just picked a commit into 1.1-stable so don't forget to pull 1.1-stable again before your next pick
[02:16:56] <agcolom> Hi Jasper,
[02:18:25] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[02:19:26] <agcolom> ok. so I need to do that between git checkout 1.1-stable and git rebase upstream/1.1-stable?
[02:21:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: if you do it like that you have to do "git fetch upstream" while in 1.1-stable branch
[02:22:05] <agcolom> right. Normally, here is what I do:
[02:22:22] <agcolom> git checkout master
[02:22:32] <agcolom> git fetch upstream
[02:22:43] <agcolom> git rebase upstream/master
[02:22:52] <agcolom> git checkout 1.1-stable
[02:23:04] <agcolom> git rebase upstream/1.1-stable
[02:23:12] <agcolom> git cherry-pick bdca5c1
[02:23:20] <agcolom> (for example ^)
[02:23:27] <agcolom> git push upstream 1.1-stable
[02:24:16] <agcolom> so would I do git fetch upstream between git checkout 1.1-stable and git rebase upstream/1.1-stable ?
[02:24:27] <agcolom> (as well as the one in master)
[02:24:39] <uGoMobi> only if you get an error when you push
[02:24:52] <agcolom> ok.
[02:25:11] <agcolom> can I try one now, to see if I get an error?
[02:25:19] <uGoMobi> yeah sure
[02:27:55] <agcolom> ok, do you think this change is correct? (I think something needs to be changed, so not sure whether it is the way that Maurice has done it or the other way round ("''"): https://github.com/MauriceG/jquery-mobile/commit/02229f10aefe38391d1a5c281e676bdc50635db9
[02:27:56] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Maurice Gottlieb (22h, 21m ago): Docs: Correct quote in quote in example code
[02:28:43] * uGoMobi is looking
[02:30:37] <uGoMobi> it can be both ways... don't know if there are more examples like this so we can check for consistency
[02:31:21] <agcolom> Maurice made a change like this one previously... so if you're happy with it I'll merge and then I can do a cherry-pick
[02:32:58] <uGoMobi> I checked, you can merge that one... it is consistent

[02:35:31] <agcolom> ok, I didn't get an error... I guess because I didn't touch the text that you cherry-picked ?
[02:35:38] <uGoMobi> agcolom: about git.... you will only get an error with pushing to 1.1-stable if you did "git fetch upstream" after I picked my commit
[02:35:48] <uGoMobi> that's not the case here :)
[02:36:14] <agcolom> ok. should I do git fetch upstream in 1.1-stable then?
[02:36:41] <uGoMobi> if you do git fetch upstream all branches get updated as far as i know
[02:37:13] <agcolom> yes, that's what I thought as well, so I should be ok then? as I do it each time from master?
[02:37:55] <uGoMobi> yeah you are ok :)
[02:38:26] <uGoMobi> sorry if i confused you
[02:38:54] <agcolom> Cool! Thanks, no worries :-)
[02:39:00] <uGoMobi> i didn't know you use fetch each time

[02:42:28] <agcolom> I am so scared of conflict after the terrible experience that I had, that I prefer to do things slowly but safely ;-)

[03:05:40] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] added heading and blurb for setting a max scroll for transitions - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[03:10:24] <agcolom> uGoMobi, are you still around?
[03:11:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yup
[03:13:18] <agcolom> quick question, don't worry if you don't know the answer:
[03:14:24] <agcolom> I have added a some text in page transitions which is in the page folder and has the 2 new items in its menu (popup and page loading widget)
[03:14:26] <uGoMobi> lol ok
[03:14:46] <agcolom> however, these 2 widgets will come only for 1.2
[03:14:56] <uGoMobi> yes
[03:15:03] <agcolom> so I cannot cherry-pick into 1.1-stable
[03:15:36] <uGoMobi> well, it will cause a conflict
[03:15:40] <agcolom> however, the page transition thing with the long lists was added into 1.1-stable
[03:15:52] <uGoMobi> best thing to do is make the same changes local in 1.1-stable branch
[03:16:02] <agcolom> ok
[03:16:22] <agcolom> so just that new text and then do a push?
[03:16:37] <uGoMobi> or solve the merge conflict by removing those menu items
[03:16:57] <uGoMobi> git checkout 1.1-stable
[03:17:02] <uGoMobi> then edit the text
[03:17:12] <uGoMobi> than push 1.1-stable
[03:17:15] <uGoMobi> then*
[03:18:01] <uGoMobi> or wait, maybe you can edit 1.1-stable with the online editor on github as well
[03:18:27] <agcolom> ok... I'll ask Todd to see how I should do this to be sure... I like your solution, as fairly easy...
[03:18:49] <uGoMobi> you can do it online
[03:19:30] <uGoMobi> switch to 1.1-stable branch when you are on the frontpage of jquery/jquery-mobile
[03:19:38] <uGoMobi> then edit the file
[03:20:04] <agcolom> ok, thanks for the suggestions... I've emailed Todd to see how it should be done... I don't want to be on the black list ;-)
