[00:22:50] <_|Nix|_> Morns!
[06:53:43] <toddmparker_> hi all
[06:53:43] <bot-t> (111 hours ago) <johnbender> tell toddmparker_ I don't get an exception on popup-simple it's the same issue because Sizzle doesn't like getting a url for a selector :)
[06:53:43] <bot-t> (111 hours ago) <johnbender> tell toddmparker_ I'm going to merge to master
[06:53:47] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: you're back!
[06:54:01] <toddmparker_> (right?)
[07:02:03] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker_
[07:03:28] <toddmparker_> hi uGoMobi!
[07:04:35] <toddmparker_> lots of triage this weekend, huh. thanks!
[07:04:40] <Wilto> Whassup, guys. Is everything fixed yet>
[07:04:41] <Wilto> ?
[07:07:27] <uGoMobi> yes Wilto, we are done
[07:07:28] <uGoMobi> ;)
[07:07:54] <uGoMobi> Wilto: but can you check one thing? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4934
[07:08:03] <Wilto> NOOOOO
[07:08:07] <Wilto> Yeah okay.
[07:08:39] <Wilto> Greenbutton’d. My bad.
[07:08:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/f9F6ag
[07:08:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Popup: Remove discarded overlay keyframes (popup.css) - Maurice Gottlieb
[07:08:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #4934 from MauriceG/patch-5 - Mat Marquis
[07:15:39] <MauriceG> Hi all!
[07:16:16] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[07:16:38] <MauriceG> Wilto: Hi, thanks for the "greening".  I was wondering if I've missed something ...
[07:16:50] <Wilto> Nope; that was my bad.
[07:17:13] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi!  Hope you're fine!
[07:17:35] <uGoMobi> I sure am, thanks
[07:17:56] <MauriceG> toddmparker_: Hi, did you get my email with the release stuff?
[07:18:20] <MauriceG> toddmparker_: about 5 days ago ...
[07:18:45] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: You don't sleep so much, heh? ;-)
[07:19:15] <uGoMobi> is this my mother using your nick MauriceG ? ;-)
[07:20:24] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  Yes, Jasper!  I am !  :-)
[08:02:35] <Wilto> Alright bros and ladybros, what’s the score today?
[08:02:42] <Wilto> Anything big on fire, following the weekend?
[08:04:55] <gseguin> mornin' folks!
[08:05:09] <Wilto> Hey gseguin.
[08:11:18] <gseguin> I'm not on jQM today but I'm back online after a week off
[08:20:01] <Wilto> johnbender, uGoMobi, _|Nix|_? Anything major need lookin’-at, or are we feeling pretty good about the state of things?
[08:34:51] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin ... survived Yosemite or decided not to go there?
[08:35:53] <gseguin> uGoMobi: decided not to go, that virus is not one of the one I want my immune system to get familiar with
[08:36:09] <uGoMobi> gseguin: smart decision
[08:36:22] <Wilto> We talkin’ zombies?
[08:36:31] <Wilto> Because I have been preparing for this day my entire life.
[08:37:12] <gseguin> :D
[08:37:39] <gseguin> nope that I would have gone
[08:38:38] <gseguin> an RPG and a spear and I would have been set
[08:38:52] <Wilto> Now we’re talkin’.
[08:47:54] <johnbender> Wilto: I feel good
[08:48:09] <johnbender> Wilto: can we just use getElementById with .find in init?
[08:48:29] <Wilto> I don’t see why not.
[08:48:36] <Wilto> Well, wiat.
[08:48:38] <Wilto> wait*
[08:48:52] <johnbender> ahh
[08:48:56] <johnbender> it's a combined selector
[08:49:00] <Wilto> Yeah.
[08:49:22] <johnbender> Wilto: not hard though
[08:49:34] <johnbender> Wilto: just get the element and if iti exists check it for the attr
[08:49:37] <Wilto> I mean, we could run the whole thing through qSA.
[08:49:51] <johnbender> Wilto: not in wp7 :(
[08:49:53] <Wilto> That might be quicker too, yeah.
[08:49:55] <Wilto> Oh, right.
[08:50:04] <johnbender> Wilto: let me take a quick look
[08:50:16] <Wilto> I feel like there was a WP7 around something like this anyway…
[08:54:51] <johnbender> Wilto: did you push that original change to a branch?
[08:55:03] <Wilto> Yezzir.
[08:55:18] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/1.8-sizzle-navfix
[08:55:25] <johnbender> Wilto: cool
[08:55:27] <johnbender> futzing now
[08:58:43] <johnbender> Wilto: super simple
[08:59:06] <Wilto> What is; getElementById and filtering or somesuch?
[08:59:36] <johnbender> $( document.getElementById( parsedHash ) ).is( ":jqmData(role=page)" )
[09:00:10] <Wilto> +1
[09:01:19] <gnarf> doesn't $( "#" + parsedHash ) short circuit to that really quickly?
[09:01:19] <johnbender> Wilto: running the test suite
[09:01:38] <johnbender> gnarf: sizzle borks if it has unescaped chars
[09:01:46] <gnarf> oh
[09:01:49] <johnbender> "borks" as in throws an exception
[09:01:51] <gnarf> this is true
[09:01:54] <johnbender> which is intentional
[09:02:08] <gnarf> i suppose that makes sense to do it that way then
[09:02:11] <johnbender> and pretty damn smart imo
[09:02:11] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I noticed some issues with popup unit test on IE9
[09:02:22] <johnbender> uGoMobi: why am I not surprised
[09:02:23] <johnbender> :(
[09:02:37] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I can take a look at it today
[09:03:07] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: you there?
[09:03:16] <uGoMobi> the biggest problem might be that after last test IE9 naviigates back to previous page
[09:03:29] <Wilto> Nobody uses IE nowadays, do they?
[09:03:31] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hmm I'll look into ti
[09:03:32] <Wilto> Or like… phones?
[09:03:44] <uGoMobi> Wilto: no IE is just for testing
[09:03:54] <Wilto> Ah, okay, I thought so.
[09:04:09] <uGoMobi> and to keep us busy
[09:04:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ahh, that's just a test issue
[09:04:43] <johnbender> I have the nav reset in there in teh setup but sometimes it conflicts with the test "back" timing
[09:04:44] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ah glad to hear that
[09:04:51] <uGoMobi> k
[09:05:27] <johnbender> uGoMobi: is it the second to last test or the last test?
[09:05:40] <uGoMobi> johnbender: let me check
[09:07:26] <todd_> Hey all
[09:07:39] <uGoMobi> johnbender: maybe it's at test 9 already
[09:07:45] <uGoMobi> test 7 and 8 fail
[09:08:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: alright I'll take a look
[09:08:44] <uGoMobi> then it looks like it continues, but i don't think test 9 actually
[09:08:57] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok cool, let me know if i can do something
[09:09:38] <toddmparker_> @mauriceG - yes, thank you
[09:09:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/28iAvA
[09:09:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] remove spurious testswarm directory addition - John Bender
[09:09:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] deal with unescaped initial hash id - John Bender
[09:12:48] <toddmparker_> hey all - I love the smell of fresh commits
[09:12:50] <toddmparker_> ahhh
[09:13:27] <toddmparker_> so other than these IE test failures, anything else that looks like it could hold up beta?
[09:13:36] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi:
[09:13:37] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3912#issuecomment-8242712
[09:13:51] <toddmparker_> you can repro?
[09:14:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes
[09:14:19] <toddmparker_> thought we fixed the toolbar tap issues with that CSS tweak and roleld back johnbender's JS fix
[09:14:20] <uGoMobi> not on 4.0.4
[09:14:22] <toddmparker_> different?
[09:14:25] <Wilto> johnbender: http://wil.to/_/approved.gif
[09:14:27] <toddmparker_> ugh
[09:14:31] <uGoMobi> yes it's different
[09:14:40] <toddmparker_> i swear I tested 4.0.4
[09:14:55] <uGoMobi> that issue was about buttons in a fixed toolbard
[09:15:10] <uGoMobi> this one about buttons/links underneath
[09:15:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: the test failures are just a lack of accounting for the new hashless approach in ie
[09:15:25] <uGoMobi> i tested that one too on 4.0.4
[09:15:47] <johnbender> shouldn't take too long to fix
[09:15:52] <uGoMobi> johnbender: i see
[09:15:53] <uGoMobi> k
[09:17:18] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: sort of scared to look at that. seems like it could just be a confluence of Android bugs
[09:17:54] <Wilto> There’s no fear in this dojo, toddmparker_.
[09:18:00] <Wilto> Er… in this jQuery.
[09:18:03] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes, I am afraid we end up with an ugly workaround
[09:18:05] <Wilto> Hm.
[09:18:16] <johnbender> "Put him in a body bag Johny!
[09:18:19] <johnbender> "
[09:18:40] <johnbender> <-- putting people in body bags since 199never
[09:18:49] <johnbender> *1990-never
[09:20:26] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: so i just tested his page and I'm not sure I get the issue. The back button works and the select works
[09:20:38] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/enuyud/4/
[09:21:18] <toddmparker_> your page has the select under the header and i can operate the back button and select
[09:21:34] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: and when you clicked the header the select menu didn't open?
[09:21:36] <toddmparker_> ^^ that link was your page
[09:21:59] <uGoMobi> nah I just updated his test page
[09:22:08] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: when i tapped the part of the header that just had the "Test Page" text?
[09:22:19] <toddmparker_> No
[09:22:39] <toddmparker_> but i could tap the part of the select that is showing an duse that
[09:22:44] <uGoMobi> what version of android?
[09:23:11] <toddmparker_> 4.0.4, Default browser
[09:23:40] <uGoMobi> aha... it's a 2.3 issue
[09:23:47] <toddmparker_> Bah
[09:24:18] <uGoMobi> and reported for honeycomb as well
[09:27:33] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: ok, i can see the select open when i tap over the bottom half of the toolbar
[09:27:52] <toddmparker_> but the back button still seems to work for me
[09:28:13] <toddmparker_> not sure how bad a problem this is
[09:28:38] <toddmparker_> seems like it could just be android trying to make assumptions about what your tap target it
[09:29:05] <toddmparker_> not going to call this a blocker
[09:29:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: when you click on the select button at the left side (below the back button), the back button is triggered
[09:30:03] <uGoMobi> i agree, it is an ugly issue but not a blocker
[09:32:44] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: I can't get that to happen. I can tap the whole left side of the select and open it
[09:33:20] <toddmparker_> I bet this is device dependent. Kin found all kinds of wacko tolerance stuff with targets.
[09:33:31] <toddmparker_> to correct for mediocre touchscreens
[09:33:56] <toddmparker_> i can almost tap the back button and still get the select.
[09:35:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: can you still reproduce this issue you opened? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2506
[09:36:03] <uGoMobi> it's an issue with Android 2.1
[09:37:02] <uGoMobi> same issue actually
[09:43:38] <todd_> I've decided our HTC phone running 2.1 is too buggy to be trusted
[09:44:07] <todd_> might be hard for me to test that accurately uGoMobi
[09:44:57] <todd_> just asked for a test page
[09:45:32] <todd_> johnbender: any clue what this URL wackiness could be? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4920#issuecomment-8211022
[09:45:47] <todd_> something is off in navland
[09:46:23] <uGoMobi> todd_: I am going to close 2506 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4480 as duplicates, create a good test page myself and then let everyone test all Android and iOS versions
[09:46:43] <johnbender> todd_: I'll take a look
[09:46:49] <uGoMobi> duplicates of 3912
[09:47:04] <johnbender> todd_: base tag issues?
[09:47:11] <johnbender> not sure
[09:47:16] <todd_> maybe. seems like it's off a hop
[09:47:36] <todd_> uGoMobi: that would be perfect, thanks
[09:48:48] <Wilto> We got mad Todds in here.
[09:49:33] <Wilto> “I've decided our HTC phone running 2.1 is too buggy to be trusted” +1 to that.
[09:52:03] <todd_> sorry, i logged into IRC cloud to get the backlog
[09:52:08] <todd_> now there's TWO of me
[09:52:12] <todd_> feeling productive
[09:55:34] <Wilto> Two Todds. The perfect storm.
[10:04:53] <uGoMobi> Wilto todd_ : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4895
[10:05:24] <uGoMobi> what do you guys think about ^^
[10:08:37] <todd_> wilto ^^
[10:09:13] <todd_> uGoMobi: i'm not worried about losing the bottom border personally
[10:10:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Pong!
[10:10:17] <uGoMobi> todd_: neither am I, so I am in favor of adding Wilto's fix again
[10:10:45] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: are you aware random of positioning problems with popup?
[10:10:56] <gseguin> I don't have a test case yet
[10:11:03] <gseguin> but I'll get to it
[10:11:18] <gseguin> but basically I have a button that opens a popup
[10:11:36] <gseguin> and the popup is supposed to open up right at that button
[10:11:46] <gseguin> and sometimes it gets centered on screen
[10:11:56] <gseguin> does that ring a bell?
[10:17:25] <Wilto> This is a little sad, but I’d want to test that -1px fix pretty thoroughly.
[10:17:48] <Wilto> I feel like that sorta thing has been added, removed, re-added, and re-removed a couple of times now.
[10:18:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ie tests should be fixed
[10:18:52] <uGoMobi> Wilto: ok, so do you think it's a good idea to add it to the beta? so we can do all the testing?
[10:18:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/K-j2Mw
[10:18:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] fix popup tests for ie - John Bender
[10:19:00] <uGoMobi> johnbender: great, thanks!
[10:19:05] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Yeah, I’m into it.
[10:22:52] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I will commit it and then notify the users that reported the issues caused by this fix in the past so they can test again as well
[10:23:11] <Wilto> Sounds good to me.
[10:23:29] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That might happen if there's a window resize after the popup opens.
[10:25:45] <johnbender> have you been able to confirm that on any other browser? I dont' have an ipad3
[10:25:51] <johnbender> and I'm having a hard time reproducing
[10:25:56] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ^
[10:26:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4920
[10:27:01] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I have only been able to reproduce on Android 4.0.4.
[10:27:27] <uGoMobi> and it is really dificult to reproduce it
[10:31:56] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I thought this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3941 is related but turned out it isn't
[10:33:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: again, is this _ever_ local?
[10:33:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: and does it happen on 2.3?
[10:35:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: issue 3941 also happens local
[10:35:45] <uGoMobi> I don't have my 2.3 device anymore, but can test on the SDK
[10:36:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: nope nope I can take a look
[10:36:11] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:40:44] <johnbender> uGoMobi: can you reproduce it consistently after a cache clear?
[10:40:58] <johnbender> ah nevermind
[10:41:07] <johnbender> you answered that already :/
[10:41:17] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it sounds like the ipad 3 is fairly consistent
[10:41:22] <johnbender> todd_: toddmparker_ ^
[10:41:29] <johnbender> at least from that issue
[10:44:24] <uGoMobi> johnbender:  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3941 i can produce consistenly on Android ICS native browser
[10:44:37] <johnbender> uGoMobi: nice!
[10:44:43] <johnbender> uGoMobi: bisect?
[10:45:11] <uGoMobi> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4920 is different story... I thought MauriceG mentioned that on iPad3 it also only happens first time
[10:45:31] <todd_> is that pop state oddness or something? url doesn't visibly update, but if you refresh, is it the right page?
[10:45:35] <todd_> brb, lunch
[10:46:06] <uGoMobi> todd_: correct, if you refresh the page everything is fine
[10:46:26] <Wilto> Dibs on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4920
[10:46:43] <Wilto> Todd and I were seeing something weird with this in assorted WebKit browsers; we can reproduce consistently over here.
[10:47:08] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes I can do a bisect
[10:47:57] <Wilto> Oh, wait, same deal as what you’re working on uGoMobi.
[10:48:03] <Wilto> I’ll leave you to it.
[10:48:52] <uGoMobi> well it's more like I am assisting johnbender :)
[10:50:02] <uGoMobi> so he can fix it :D
[10:51:04] <Wilto> Story of my jQM career.
[10:51:53] <uGoMobi> haha
[10:53:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: sorry I keep getting bounced
[10:53:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi: did you get my message about bisect?
[10:53:32] <uGoMobi> 19:44 <johnbender> uGoMobi: bisect?
[10:53:45] <uGoMobi> let's do that
[10:53:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: awesome
[10:54:12] <uGoMobi> already reading http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git
[10:54:16] <johnbender> :)
[10:54:23] <johnbender> if finds bugs for/with you
[10:54:47] <uGoMobi> not really experienced with it... but there has to be a first time
[10:55:06] <uGoMobi> yes I know, just don't know yet where exactly you test against
[10:55:32] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it'll checkout the commits for you and you just have to try to reproduce the issue locally
[10:55:39] <johnbender> if you can reproduce it, the commit is bad
[10:55:43] <johnbender> if you can't it's good
[10:55:50] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[10:55:52] <johnbender> that's why reproducing it consistently is important
[10:56:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it does a binary search from the starting point until you zero in on the commit
[10:56:23] <uGoMobi> I was thinking (hoping) we could write some test and it checks good/bad automatically
[10:56:56] <uGoMobi> was already on my way to check if the issue is present in 1.1.1.
[10:57:20] <uGoMobi> we have to find a starting point right?
[11:02:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: is it a good idea to create a new local branch for this? or not likely I mess up my git with this? :)
[11:02:48] <gseguin> johnbender: congrats on getting your talk accepted at JSConf.EU
[11:08:09] <uGoMobi> oh that's very cool indeed johnbender, congrats!
[11:09:10] <Wilto> Oh damn. Congrats, man.
[11:14:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: gseguin: thanks :)
[11:15:04] <johnbender> lots of new stuff to add to it
[11:15:11] <johnbender> bought my ticket yesterday
[11:15:49] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I wouldn't worry about a new branch you aren't modifying things
[11:15:54] <johnbender> just bouncing between commits
[11:16:02] <uGoMobi> oh ok :)
[11:27:08] <johnbender> todd_: toddmparker_: any outstanding issues asside from that 404 before we can push to beta?
[11:29:04] <todd_> johnbender: I don't think so. Testing looked good on Friday.
[11:29:11] <johnbender> todd_: super nice
[11:29:15] <todd_> There was that issue with IE7 not opening popups
[11:29:25] <johnbender> todd_: did you test that, it should be fixed
[11:29:33] <todd_> booting up now
[11:29:34] <johnbender> they were the same issue
[11:30:01] <johnbender> the href attr was full and not just the hash as defined in the html
[11:30:05] <johnbender> so it had to be parsed
[11:31:34] <todd_> johnbender: congrats on JSConf.EU
[11:31:48] <johnbender> todd_: :)
[11:31:53] <johnbender> lots of heavy hitter it looks like
[11:32:00] <johnbender> which makes me happy
[11:32:08] <johnbender> super excited to go to berlin again
[11:32:09] <todd_> you deserve it
[11:32:13] <johnbender> such a great city
[11:32:20] <johnbender> todd_: thanks man!
[11:33:43] <ryanneufeld> berlin! Lucky!
[11:34:07] <Wilto> johnbender: take us with you
[11:34:07] <todd_> johnbender: WP7.0 is a GO
[11:34:09] <todd_> nice
[11:34:20] <todd_> I mean, it's slow and looks like crap but it works again
[11:34:20] <johnbender> yar!
[11:34:23] <johnbender> :)
[11:34:29] <todd_> nice
[11:34:42] <todd_> so I think I just need to make the docs changes for beta
[11:34:47] <todd_> and we can do the build
[11:34:51] <Wilto> High-fives all around.
[11:34:55] <uGoMobi> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3941 is actually already an issue in JQM 1.0
[11:34:58] <todd_> FINALLY
[11:35:05] <johnbender> uGoMobi: lol
[11:35:06] <johnbender> wtf
[11:35:17] <johnbender> uGoMobi: wait?
[11:35:18] <johnbender> what?
[11:35:24] <johnbender> that page doesn't exist in 1.0 right?
[11:35:45] <uGoMobi> johnbender: this is not about the popup example page
[11:35:48] <johnbender> ahh
[11:35:58] <uGoMobi> this is about the url not updating
[11:36:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I dunno about that one
[11:36:49] <uGoMobi> maybe you missed a part because you got bounced
[11:37:05] <uGoMobi> I thought it was related to the 404 issue
[11:37:09] <johnbender> I miss lots of things for lots of reasons that have nothing to do with my internet connection :(
[11:37:12] <johnbender> ah
[11:37:13] <johnbender> ok
[11:37:20] <johnbender> that's where I'm getting my wires crossed
[11:37:26] <johnbender> uGoMobi: and it works just fine
[11:37:29] <johnbender> but the url isn't updating ...
[11:37:29] <uGoMobi> because when you get the 404 on that popup page... /popup/ is missing in the url
[11:37:43] <johnbender> uGoMobi: sorry
[11:37:52] <johnbender> I was hoping we could get a bisect going on that 404 issue
[11:37:59] <uGoMobi> aha
[11:38:05] <johnbender> have we been able to reproduce that one locally?
[11:38:23] <uGoMobi> that's an issue I cannot reproduce consistently
[11:38:32] <uGoMobi> could you Wilto?
[11:38:45] <Wilto> Todd could, yeah.
[11:38:47] <johnbender> I can't get it to happen at all
[11:38:49] <Wilto> I seen it.
[11:39:11] <johnbender> if there's some consistent threshold at which we can reproduce it
[11:39:13] <johnbender> then we can bisect
[11:39:20] <johnbender> even if it takes a while
[11:39:35] <johnbender> again, assuming you can reproduce on your local instance
[11:41:40] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/uHxdOw
[11:41:40] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added a link to the routerlite plugin. - toddparker
[11:41:47] <todd_> didn't agcolom have a docs checklist of things to edit for each release?
[11:42:01] <uGoMobi> todd_: yes
[11:42:11] <uGoMobi> i think she linked it on BC
[11:42:44] <todd_> don't see it on the wiki, but i can never...
[11:42:55] <todd_> johnbender: should we ship with 1.8.1?
[11:43:19] <todd_> ah! https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Release-Instructions-Checklist
[11:43:44] <uGoMobi> master is still on 1.8.0
[11:44:00] <todd_> uGoMobi: I know, that's why I was asking
[11:44:24] <johnbender> todd_: ship beta?
[11:44:32] <johnbender> might as well
[11:44:43] <todd_> johnbender: will the filename be 1.2.0-beta.1
[11:44:45] <Wilto> Want me to track down that 404 thing first?
[11:44:50] <todd_> i need to update the docs
[11:44:51] <johnbender> todd_: actually I take that back
[11:45:01] <johnbender> hmm
[11:45:02] <uGoMobi> i meant... shouldn't we  test with 1.8.1 first?
[11:45:05] <johnbender> thinkin
[11:45:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah that was my thought but 1.8.0 is the "buggy" release because people are lazy
[11:45:38] <johnbender> most poeple will move on to 1.8.1 because it's just bug fixes
[11:45:45] <johnbender> so it would seem odd to restrict them
[11:45:48] <johnbender> and we are doing the beta
[11:45:53] <johnbender> which gives use time to check with the community
[11:46:06] <todd_> yeah, that is their thinking. nobody tests a .0
[11:46:13] <todd_> so they do a .1 really fast after
[11:46:25] <uGoMobi> ah ok, learning here :)
[11:46:30] <todd_> just wondering if we should make that switch
[11:46:42] <todd_> in master and plan on pushing this tomorrow
[11:46:46] <todd_> to see if anything crops up
[11:46:53] <johnbender> probably
[11:47:07] <Wilto> +1
[11:47:19] * johnbender goes to do it
[11:47:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: is there still a way to run all unit tests?
[11:48:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you can run unit tests for any version you want
[11:48:34] <todd_> thinking we'll be saying this:
[11:48:40] <todd_> jQuery Mobile 1.2 beta (1.2.0-beta.1) works with  jQuery core versions 1.6.4 to 1.8.1.
[11:48:41] <johnbender> it'll refernce the version you specify on the cdn
[11:48:52] <todd_> wonder when we can drop older versions of core?
[11:49:15] <uGoMobi> johnbender: but if I go to tests/unit/ I have to start all test manually
[11:50:52] <johnbender> todd_: after this release we're removing all the jquery version in the js/ folder
[11:50:52] <johnbender> it's driving me insane
[11:50:52] <johnbender> we can keep one copy local for deving on planes and whatnot
[11:50:52] <johnbender> but having all the version vendored in the js/ dir is crazytown
[11:50:53] <johnbender> when I say "we're removing" I really mean, "I would really like to get started on removing"
[11:51:16] <todd_> yeah?
[11:51:17] <johnbender> todd_: I'll aslo make sure that we run the tests for the older versions at the end of the day instead of on every run
[11:51:22] <todd_> great
[11:51:23] <johnbender> ala UI
[11:52:12] <johnbender> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile#testing
[11:52:18] <johnbender> last snippet
[11:53:05] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ah of course... thanks!
[11:59:00] <johnbender> gseguin: do you know if uber vets their drivers?
[11:59:19] <gseguin> what do you mean by that?
[11:59:32] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[11:59:48] <johnbender> gseguin: random people in black cars picking up othe random people seems shady from a saftey perspective
[11:59:59] <johnbender> gseguin: my wife is going to nyc and I like the idea better than her standing on a curb at night
[12:00:24] <gseguin> like, do they do background check on them?
[12:00:31] <gseguin> I can ask
[12:00:54] <johnbender> gseguin: yah, who are the people driving the cars and do I really want my wife catching a ride with some random person?
[12:01:06] <johnbender> at least in NYC the cabs are marked and tracked
[12:01:19] <johnbender> people might see which cab she got in etc
[12:01:49] <gseguin> I never got hit on by an uber driver, but that doesn't mean anything ;)
[12:02:10] <todd_> you're not pretty enough gseguin
[12:02:31] <todd_> they are very closely tracked, never a guarantee of anything but...
[12:02:39] <johnbender> yah
[12:02:46] <todd_> you could have her call you when she hails one and you can stay on the line
[12:02:48] <johnbender> the gps I guess
[12:02:53] <johnbender> todd_: of course
[12:03:04] <johnbender> still curious though
[12:03:13] <johnbender> side note: I'm fucking paranoid
[12:03:18] <johnbender> let no one tell you different
[12:03:31] <gseguin> johnbender: that's a euphemism it looks like
[12:03:39] <todd_> i hear everyone talking about your paranoia behind your back
[12:03:44] <todd_> it's the voices
[12:03:45] <Wilto> I’d never let them tell me that—not when I don’t know WHO THEY’RE WORKING FOR.
[12:03:52] <johnbender> I do my best to recognize it and deal with it
[12:04:05] <johnbender> Wilto: my point exactly
[12:04:17] <Wilto> As I’ve said before, your paranoid serves to keep “what could possibly go wrong” flakes like Todd and I in check.
[12:04:26] <Wilto> No offense, Todd.
[12:05:52] <Wilto> Some offense, Wilto.
[12:06:06] <Wilto> s/paranoid/paranoia
[12:09:33] <Wilto> Also, speaking on the topic of hitching rides with randos, as an ex-hitchhiker: probably don’t do that ever. EVER.
[12:12:44] <Wilto> Especially if that rando is miketaylr.
[12:12:52] <miketaylr> uh oh
[12:12:55] <Wilto> oh whoop he’s here everybody shh
[12:13:28] <todd_> king of randos
[12:13:36] <Wilto> That’s what I heard.
[12:13:42] <todd_> wait…did wilt just call me a "flake"
[12:13:57] <todd_> brb, throwing his laptop out the window
[12:14:16] <Wilto> haha he says that all the time but he never actually doe
[12:15:02] <todd_> johnbender: so i made the changes to the docs to point to beta and say we support 1.8.1 but should i wait to commit those until right before we go?
[12:15:25] <todd_> Wilto has signed off. permanently.
[12:15:32] <Wilto> NO CARRIER
[12:19:06] <todd_> to reproduce that 404
[12:19:11] <todd_> jquerymobile.com/test
[12:19:16] <todd_> pages > popup
[12:19:20] <todd_> open a popup, close
[12:19:31] <todd_> click on one of those 3 advanced buttons
[12:19:32] <todd_> = 404
[12:19:40] <todd_> android 2.3, 4.1
[12:20:43] <todd_> iOS 5 too
[12:20:49] <todd_> it's legit
[12:21:01] <todd_> can repro 100% of the time johnbender
[12:21:29] <todd_> chrome mac too
[12:21:34] <todd_> this is just busted
[12:21:39] <todd_> everywhere
[12:22:01] <todd_> 404 Not Found
[12:22:02] <todd_> nginx/1.2.3
[12:22:32] <todd_> also reproducible locally
[12:22:33] <todd_> http://localhost:8888/jquery-mobile/popup-images.html
[12:23:08] <Wilto> Hm.
[12:23:36] <uGoMobi> right... I now see it everywhere
[12:23:48] <todd_> I see dead links
[12:24:54] <todd_> seems like maybe page change cleans this up because if i start at home and open a dialog (not popup), then close and go to the Anatomy of a page which has non-ajax links to the boilerplates, it works
[12:25:28] <Wilto> todd_: Twist ending.
[12:25:44] <Wilto> Waaait.
[12:25:52] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, I follow you.
[12:26:48] <uGoMobi> tested popup example page link without data-ajax="false" and it works too
[12:27:16] <Wilto> So the popup trigger is breaking a `base` tag or something…?
[12:28:18] <Wilto> Please hold; might have something.
[12:29:45] <uGoMobi> hang on... I also got the 404 now without data-ajax="false"
[12:29:56] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! That's just weird ...
[12:31:22] <todd_> I just tried a similar scenario with a dialog and it works fine so it's a popup thing
[12:31:43] <todd_> hey _|Nix|_
[12:31:48] <todd_> yes, yes it is
[12:36:58] <_|Nix|_> Also, weird ... how come the advanced techniques buttons repeat at the bottom?
[12:37:12] <todd_> those can probably go _|Nix|_
[12:37:40] <_|Nix|_> Gone.
[12:40:06] <uGoMobi> it only happens after opening and closing a popup first... could this be related https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4893
[12:41:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, the way the popup hooks into the click handler is via the pagechange event.
[12:41:37] <_|Nix|_> That's how we avoid having popup as a dependency of nav.
[12:46:32] <_|Nix|_> Interestingly, only the advanced techniques buttons are broken. Similar links (such as the ones at the top (Options/Methods/Events)) continue to work fine.
[12:49:54] <uGoMobi> it must be the data-ajax="false"
[12:51:15] <uGoMobi> maybe I did something wrong when I thought it was also happening if I remove data-ajax="false" from the link
[12:51:52] <uGoMobi> I now cannot reproduce it anymore without data-ajax="false"
[12:53:24] <_|Nix|_> This is insane. I copied the controlgroup from the top of the page, removed one of the buttons, and changed the link targets to each of the three advanced techniques, and the weirdest thing happens: after opening and closing a popup, when I hover above the "Scaling images link" the destination it shows in the status bar is wrong, but when I click on it, it works correctly!
[12:53:54] <_|Nix|_> s/ link"/" link/
[12:55:00] <_|Nix|_> *clunk* ... that's the sound of my jaw hitting the floor.
[12:55:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I never added data-ajax="false" ...
[12:56:31] <_|Nix|_> So, to fix, replace the three buttons with a controlgroup ...
[12:57:00] * _|Nix|_ bursts into a maniacal cackle, interspersed with brief periods of sobbing ...
[12:57:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I added data-ajax="false" to those links because a custom script is loaded on those example pages
[12:57:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I oughta pull from github I guess ...
[13:02:10] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: when you set a transition for popups, shouldn't it be used both ways
[13:02:45] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: in other words, if I set it to none, when discarding the popup I shouldn't have a transition
[13:04:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That should certainly be true. If there's no opening transition, there should be no closing transition either, unless you set the transition option while the popup is open.
[13:04:48] <gseguin> it's not the case (or maybe I'm doing something wrong)
[13:05:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: What are you seeing?
[13:05:34] <gseguin> the hashchange is causing a changePage call which will use the default page change transition
[13:06:10] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ^
[13:07:29] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, but the popup doesn't use the default page change transition. It has its own.
[13:07:44] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I know
[13:07:54] <gseguin> and that works on the way forward
[13:08:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: On docs/pages/popup/index.html the basic popup works correctly ...
[13:08:08] <gseguin> hmm
[13:08:16] <gseguin> maybe something I'm doing
[13:08:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You mean if you open a link to another page from the popup?
[13:08:23] <gseguin> https://gist.github.com/806ba7c002ed44d9649e seems to do the trick
[13:08:49] <gseguin> so I have a button that triggers a confirmation popup
[13:09:03] <gseguin> if you click yes it changes page to a different url
[13:09:16] <gseguin> if you click no it just closes the dialog
[13:09:41] <gseguin> clicking no was causing a transition to my current page
[13:09:44] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... and the no case causes the popup to transition out instead of disappearing?
[13:09:57] <gseguin> yes
[13:10:04] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK ... so it's changing page from x to x.
[13:10:10] <gseguin> exactly
[13:10:20] <gseguin> which is borked for some reason
[13:10:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... but the popup disappears without a transition, right?
[13:10:30] <gseguin> I end up with a gray screen
[13:10:41] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Well, I think "No" should be data-rel="back"
[13:10:59] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... instead of href="page-where-I-came-from.html"
[13:11:27] <gseguin> I think that's what we had before I started looking at the problem
[13:11:32] <gseguin> let me try again
[13:12:31] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The same thing happens in a dialog. If you have a link that takes you to the page that opened the dialog, it moves forward, creating a new history entry and everything. The difference is, with a dialog that looks exactly the same as if you had gone back.
[13:13:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: In both cases you end up with this history: x -> x&ui-state=dialog -> x
[13:13:52] <gseguin> yeah doesn't work with data-rel="back"
[13:15:19] <todd_> odd
[13:15:22] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Weird ... we have a dialog example in the docs, and that one has data-rel="back" buttons ...
[13:15:28] <todd_> good catch gseguin
[13:15:41] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Works in the docs though ...
[13:15:54] <gseguin> I may be doing something wrong
[13:16:08] <Wilto> Even the Wu-Tang Clan can’t seem to help me sort this issue.
[13:16:26] <Wilto> Something in popup is nuking/resetting our `base` tag.
[13:17:56] <_|Nix|_> Yep. Upon closing the popup.
[13:18:31] <Wilto> This—this—is why I don’t use the web.
[13:18:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when I add data-ajax="false" to one of the links in the controlgroup (options/methods/events) the issue occurs too
[13:19:02] <Wilto> —wait a sec.
[13:19:47] <uGoMobi> and it only happens if you visited another page first
[13:20:28] <uGoMobi> if you are on popup/index.html and refresh, then open and close a popup, all links work just fine
[13:21:04] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... I think the base tag is set to the url of $.mobile.firstPage ...
[13:21:18] <_|Nix|_> I suspect it's because a _handleHashChange( "" ) takes place.
[13:23:37] <uGoMobi> it doesn't happen on IE
[13:24:10] <_|Nix|_> IE FTW :)
[13:24:10] <todd_> iiiinteresting uGoMobi
[13:24:24] <uGoMobi> indeed
[13:24:30] <uGoMobi> IE9
[13:24:36] <uGoMobi> now testing WP
[13:27:12] <uGoMobi> also no problem
[13:27:55] <uGoMobi> going to test on IE10
[13:28:19] <uGoMobi> I say it is history.replaceState()
[13:28:51] <uGoMobi> if the issue does occur on IE10
[13:29:36] <_|Nix|_> This is issue 4097 all over again.
[13:29:47] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4097
[13:30:32] <_|Nix|_> We've only fixed it partially, it seems. While the root page is no longer displayed, the base tag is set from the root page.
[13:31:36] <uGoMobi> and YES it does happen on IE10
[13:31:59] <uGoMobi> IE9 does not support history.relaceState() and IE10 does
[13:32:30] <_|Nix|_> Navigating back from a stale dialogHashKey history entry causes the base tag to be set to the URL of $.mobile.firstPage ...
[13:33:10] <uGoMobi> that's it
[13:36:09] <Wilto> I don’t get this.
[13:47:46] <Wilto> gonna punch the whole internet
[13:50:09] <todd_> johnbender: any theories?
[13:50:18] <todd_> think you might be closest to nav
[13:50:22] <todd_> or gseguin?
[13:52:16] <_|Nix|_> loadPage calls base.reset() which sets the base tag to documentBase.hrefNoHash which, when returning from a stale dialogHashKey is set to the URL of $.mobile.firstPage, for some reason ...
[13:52:39] <todd_> seems hopeful now that you've narrowed it down that much
[13:52:52] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[13:53:54] <_|Nix|_> Basically, base.reset() is called even on normal page changes. However, it is followed by base.set(), which sets the new base. However, in the case of returning from a stale dialogHashKey, base.set() is never called. So, base.reset() resets the tag, but it is not set to the correct value afterwards.
[13:53:54] <todd_> keep digging!
[13:55:45] <_|Nix|_> OK, got it. The base tag is set from the AJAX success callback, but it is reset even if an AJAX request will never be issued.
[13:55:48] <johnbender> todd_: reading back
[13:56:47] <Wilto> Ahh, NICE.
[13:56:50] <Wilto> Good catch, _|Nix|_
[13:57:00] <_|Nix|_> So, it seems like we should only reset the base tag if we're going to make an AJAX call, and set it both in case of failure, and in case of success.
[13:57:19] <Wilto> Sounds right to me.
[13:57:59] <johnbender> todd_: looks like _|Nix|_ has sorted it out
[13:58:04] <_|Nix|_> Or, don't reset it at all. Can we assume that, if the AJAX request fails, we'll remain on whatever page we're on now?
[13:58:29] <johnbender> unless people are binding to ajax failure
[13:58:32] <johnbender> and doing something else
[13:58:33] <johnbender> but yes
[13:58:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, but if they're doing something else using our API, then that should be fine, right?
[13:59:05] <johnbender> seems like it
[13:59:05] <Wilto> Assume I came up with a phrasing more diplomatic than “that wouldn’t be our problem.”
[13:59:14] <Wilto> Yeah; what you guys said.
[14:15:35] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: You patching that up now?
[14:20:13] <Wilto> There is probably not much point in my continuing to bang my head against this, if like eight of us are on it.
[14:20:26] <Wilto> Is there anything else kicking around that I should link into, so I’m not burning a day on being stumped?
[14:20:31] <Wilto> look into, rather.
[14:24:17] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Yes.
[14:24:47] <Wilto> MY WORK HERE IS DONE
[14:25:21] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/QQf9pg
[14:25:21] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [navigation] Do not reset the base tag if, during loadPage we find that the page is already in the DOM, or that we have been prevented from continuing because the default for the "pagebeforeload" event has been prevented. - Gabriel Schulhof
[14:25:57] <Wilto> Niiiice.
[14:26:06] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I hope so.
[14:26:46] * _|Nix|_ ducks behind a large rock, under his depleted uranium armoured shell.
[14:26:57] <Wilto> What could possibly go wrong?
[14:27:41] <_|Nix|_> Well, the broken links to the popup advanced techniques are fixed, at any rate ...
[14:28:41] <Wilto> Methinks something did go wrong.
[14:28:42] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/af10d869c8c543e572f80e7ea97225354944a052
[14:29:36] <todd_> _|Nix|_: that commit seems to not do anything
[14:31:50] <johnbender> todd_: check the line numbers
[14:31:59] <johnbender> unless you mean that you tested it
[14:32:40] <Wilto> Nah, still seems busted to me.
[14:32:59] <_|Nix|_> I moved the reset call to below the two early exits.
[14:33:10] <_|Nix|_> loadPage should exit before it gets to the reset.
[14:33:21] <todd_> Ha. out of context...
[14:33:38] <Wilto> Oh, sorry, cache issue.
[14:33:47] <Wilto> WE ARE GOOD
[14:34:05] <todd_> BOOM
[14:34:10] <_|Nix|_> *whew*
[14:34:14] <todd_> great detective work everyone
[14:34:26] <todd_> that bug has been driving me nuts for weeks
[14:34:39] <todd_> ok, so NOW I think we're ready for beta
[14:34:44] <todd_> any objections?
[14:34:47] <johnbender> newp
[14:34:54] <_|Nix|_> The thing is, we should be smart enough not to even call loadPage when we're going back from a stale dialogHashKey ...
[14:35:54] <_|Nix|_> Still, this is good, because it seems logically correct. That is, if you know you're not gonna load a new page, don't start preparations for loading a new page.
[14:37:11] <uGoMobi> todd_: I will commit a fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4895 in a few minutes
[14:37:32] <uGoMobi> better if we test that in beta
[14:42:08] <_|Nix|_> Should we add a unit test to check this return-from-stale-dialog-hash-key-does-not-clobber-base-tag case?
[14:42:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you can devise one, yes please
[14:42:28] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[14:42:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I already have a test involving a stale dialog hash key. I can add the base tag test to that one.
[14:42:57] <todd_> ok uGoMobi - that would be great to fix
[14:43:00] <todd_> (and test)
[14:43:21] <uGoMobi> I am testing it now on all browsers
[14:44:32] <todd_> cool
[14:45:05] <_|Nix|_> OK ... where'd my test go?
[14:49:41] <_|Nix|_> I'm afraid the test will have to wait until the morning.
[14:49:47] * _|Nix|_ go bed now
[14:49:52] <_|Nix|_> L8R all!
[14:51:20] <uGoMobi> good night _|Nix|_
[14:53:25] <Wilto> No objections here.
[14:53:29] <Wilto> Good stuff, _|Nix|_.
[15:05:39] <todd_> so johnbender - i'll work on the blog post tonight
[15:05:47] <todd_> and we can go live tomorrow sometime
[15:05:50] <todd_> sound good?
[15:06:10] <todd_> is it ok if i commit my changes in the docs to point to beta?
[15:06:18] <todd_> some CDN links will break
[15:06:32] <todd_> until you get a built up for me to test on
[15:07:30] <johnbender> todd_: why don't I just change the version locally and do a push
[15:07:34] <uGoMobi> Wilto: the problem with that 1px jitter fix comes with tapToggle... when the toolbars are positioned absolute the vertical scrollbar shows up
[15:07:35] <johnbender> we can update it as we like
[15:07:39] <johnbender> just tag when we're read
[15:08:56] <uGoMobi> Wilto: got that fixed now, but still trying to do it in a way the buttons in the toolbar don't shift 1px on tapToggle
[15:10:10] <johnbender> todd_: I've switch us over to running a build against the old versions of jquery once a day
[15:10:19] <johnbender> our master build will just be against jquery.js in the repo
[15:11:05] <johnbender> todd_: I'm going to remove the other versions from js/
[15:14:48] <todd_> great johnbender
[15:15:00] <johnbender> todd_: hmm might not be so easy to remove them :(
[15:15:01] <todd_> so are you saying I should push the beta changes to master?
[15:15:11] <johnbender> todd_: you mean the docs changes?
[15:15:18] <johnbender> todd_: I don't see why not
[15:15:23] <johnbender> well
[15:15:24] <johnbender> hmm
[15:15:32] <johnbender> yah that should be fine
[15:15:49] <johnbender> we won't tag it so it doesn't matter
[15:18:35] <johnbender> todd_: just let me know when and I'll do a push
[15:20:06] <todd_> ok
[15:20:17] <todd_> figure I can push those to master and you can do a build like normal
[15:20:23] <todd_> once it's all tested, we'll tag
[15:20:27] <johnbender> yep
[15:20:28] <todd_> ok, pushing
[15:20:31] <johnbender> that's how it works
[15:20:51] <johnbender> todd_: I just alter the version.txt locally when I do a build
[15:21:08] <todd_> yeah, I didn't mess with that
[15:21:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/tRVqdw
[15:21:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Replaced refs from alpha to beta. jQuery core support now goes to 1.8.1 - toddparker
[15:21:25] <todd_> i gotta run, but will be on later as i work on the blog post
[15:21:29] <johnbender> todd_: sounds good
[15:21:40] <todd_> great. can't wait to get to beta
[15:21:48] <todd_> thanks for hanging in there everyone
[15:35:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/N4vhRg
[15:35:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] default to 1.8.1 - John Bender
[15:35:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] pull version specified in a query param from the cdn - John Bender
[16:03:46] <gseguin> I have a patch for the popup closing transition issue I talked about this morning
[16:03:53] <gseguin> I need to test it a little more
[16:04:09] <johnbender> gseguin: what's the problem?
[16:04:11] <gseguin> but I think that it's a good candidate for beta
[16:04:26] <gseguin> when you have a popup and you close it
[16:04:33] <gseguin> it uses the page transition
[16:04:45] <gseguin> instead of the popup transition
[16:04:54] <johnbender> eeenteresting
[16:05:02] <gseguin> so if you've set your popup transition to be none
[16:05:19] <gseguin> you still get a transition when you close it
[16:12:34] <johnbender> gseguin: yah that's a good thing to patch
[16:14:29] <gseguin> argh the code I have is stale
[16:14:36] <gseguin> maybe it's not an issue anymore
[16:15:12] * gseguin takes an update
[16:24:08] <gseguin> ok it's actually solved if you close the popup programmatically
[16:24:28] <johnbender> gseguin: 'close' uses window.history.back
[16:24:28] * gseguin feels embarassed
[16:24:32] <gseguin> but
[16:24:54] <gseguin> if you have a <a data-rel="back" then the problem still occurs
[16:25:17] <johnbender> hrm
[16:25:27] <johnbender> gseguin: is that with history disabled or in all browsers?
[16:25:49] <gseguin> playing with Chrome only
[16:25:59] <johnbender> ok so history is enabled
[16:26:05] <gseguin> yes
[16:26:06] <johnbender> it should be following the same codepath then
[16:26:13] <johnbender> if it's not there's a problem
[16:26:24] <johnbender> clearly :P
[16:26:48] <gseguin> I'll try to build a test case tonight
[16:27:02] <gseguin> I have to drop off for a bit
[18:25:01] <toddmparker_> anyone around?
[18:27:01] <toddmparker_> I am seeing the transition oddness with popups with slide and flow. once the transition finishes, it re-positions to the middle of the screen.
[18:27:11] <toddmparker_> i think gseguin mentioned that today
[18:27:18] <toddmparker_> this is on iOS 5.1
[18:41:46] <toddmparker_> With these recent changes, I no longer see the URL bar drop in iOS when I open and close a popup
[18:41:57] <toddmparker_> anyone see that too? If so, that's great
[19:21:39] <toddmparker_> Just noticed that the history option isn't in the popup options API anymore. when did the get removed?
[19:22:49] <toddmparker_> it was there and documented a few days ago
[19:24:12] <toddmparker_> See: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-simple/docs/pages/popup/options.html
[19:24:55] <toddmparker_> history boolean
[19:24:55] <toddmparker_> default: true
[19:24:55] <toddmparker_> Sets whether to alter the url when a popup is open to support the back button. Also exposed as a data attribute: data-history="true"
[19:24:55] <toddmparker_> $( ".selector" ).popup({ history: false });
[19:25:16] <toddmparker_> I was adding this to the blog
[21:08:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: dunno, I'll take a look, but if you do a git log -p /docs/pages/popup/options.html you'll see the changes for that file
[21:08:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: also, it might be that the docs are only one master
[21:08:42] <johnbender> since I merged the branch already
[21:08:47] <johnbender> checking
[21:09:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's in Master
[21:25:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: deployed
