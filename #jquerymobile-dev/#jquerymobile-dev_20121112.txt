[08:38:49] <toddmparker__> Good morning
[08:38:59] <toddmparker__> how goes?
[08:42:53] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_: great to hear tests are passing. that for all widgets in the corner branch?
[08:51:05] <toddmparker__> RTL for jQM: http://www.intlaqa.com/jquery-mobile-rtl/rtl.jquery.mobile-1.2.0/index.htm
[08:51:28] <toddmparker__> http://www.intlaqa.com/jquery-mobile-rtl/
[08:51:45] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: hi! yes, all tests in css-corner-branch pass
[08:51:55] <toddmparker__> wonder if we should reach out to him and talk about how to either official support this or at least make maintanance easier
[08:52:01] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: great!
[08:52:14] <toddmparker__> so does that mean this can be merged into master then?
[08:53:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: yes
[08:54:52] <toddmparker__> nice
[08:55:14] <toddmparker__> i need to talk to scott about where we are with unit test coverage for the RWD table stuff
[08:55:17] <toddmparker__> need to get that in
[09:07:20] <johnbender> toddmparker__: good news
[09:08:30] <johnbender> all nav tests (except sequence) are passing in chrome
[09:08:40] <johnbender> ah
[09:08:46] <johnbender> and except for the scrolling one with hash change
[09:09:12] <johnbender> so I've got a small checklist of things left to do before I merge
[09:09:20] <toddmparker__> johnbender: great news!
[09:09:41] <toddmparker__> sounds like the corner changes are also in good shape, test-wise
[09:09:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: Wilto: gseguin|away: kinblas: scottjehl__: agcolom: toddmparker__: so help me if there are merge conflicts when I pull this thing into master I will find you and hurt you :)
[09:09:57] <toddmparker__> be good to have you be able to look at the nav decoupling stuff a bit
[09:10:18] * johnbender is sort of kidding
[09:10:22] <toddmparker__> i'm sure that won't ever happen
[09:10:32] <toddmparker__> force push ftw
[09:10:34] <johnbender> it's almost guaranteed with a branch that's been alive this long
[09:11:29] <Wilto> what did I do
[09:20:14] <uGoMobi> johnbender: thanks for the warning... I think I just remember I have to go somewhere ;)
[09:28:47] <agcolom> johnbender: toddmparker: Wilto: gseguin: We are wondering whether there is something wrong in the docs regarding widget events. I've had a chat with _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi at the weekend, but we'd like to check with you also.
[09:29:01] <johnbender> agcolom: sure
[09:29:50] <agcolom> thanks
[09:29:53] <agcolom> so, if we look at http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-events.html
[09:30:13] <agcolom> should $( ".selector" ).collapsible({
[09:30:13] <agcolom>    create: function(event, ui) { ... }
[09:30:13] <agcolom> });
[09:30:22] <agcolom> really use the widget name?
[09:31:07] <agcolom> and no $( ".selector" ).bind({ (or $( ".selector" ).on({
[09:32:34] <agcolom> all form elements and listview use the widget name, while popups and dialogs use bind...
[09:33:02] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi came up with this jsbin: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/478/edit
[09:33:34] <agcolom> and the event doesn't get fired, while if you replace .slider with .on it works...
[09:34:19] <johnbender> sounds like a really bad inconsistency on our part
[09:34:23] <johnbender> I would log it as a bug
[09:34:31] <johnbender> well
[09:34:58] <johnbender> and we should figure out if we want to support both
[09:35:10] <johnbender> probably a good question for the UI folks
[09:35:45] <agcolom> yes, that was my next move... check with scott_gonzalez to see how they do it...
[09:37:49] <agcolom> so should I log an issue in github?
[09:42:02] <johnbender> agcolom: yah definitely
[09:42:06] <johnbender> we need to keep track of that
[09:42:11] <toddmparker__> and ask scott g
[09:44:51] <agcolom> thank you very much. Yes I thought I was going mad this weekend ;-)
[09:46:19] <agcolom> btw, I'm going to Mozilla on friday evening. Please let me know if there's anything you'd like me to tell them or test on their devices...
[09:48:17] <johnbender> ask them to ship a couple over for testing :)
[09:48:33] <agcolom> I have already, but will remind them ;)
[09:48:46] <agcolom> (asked)
[10:04:37] <agcolom> johnbender: _|Nix|_: is there a create event for popups? (not documented on http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/events.html)
[10:05:42] <johnbender> agcolom: I belive all widgets get the create event by default
[10:05:47] <johnbender> believe
[10:06:44] <agcolom> johnbender: that's what I think also.
[10:07:05] <agcolom> and that's what scott G told me
[10:07:35] <agcolom> So it is ok for me just to add it?
[10:10:08] <agcolom> scottjehl__:
[10:10:21] <agcolom> sorry ^ my mistake!
[10:11:41] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi Scott, what is your view on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5271 (how is this done in UI?)
[10:45:26] <johnbender> toddmparker__: gseguin: Wilto: blackberry call!
[10:45:34] <toddmparker__> all widgets should issue a create event
[10:45:37] <johnbender> toddmparker__: gseguin: Wilto: I can't attend
[10:45:40] <Wilto> Gotta skip today; Iâ€™m in presentation-mode.
[10:45:49] <johnbender> toddmparker__: will you be able to make it?
[10:46:15] <toddmparker__> yep, i'll be on the call
[10:46:27] <johnbender> toddmparker__: ok, I have a quick call with Jorge so I'll try to hop on after
[10:46:33] <toddmparker__> ok
[10:46:40] <gseguin> not sure I'll be very useful given my reduced throttle these days but if you need me, let me know
[10:46:51] <toddmparker__> ok gseguin
[10:47:02] <toddmparker__> i'm happy to hold down the fort
[10:47:23] <gseguin> looks like it's going to be Laurent's last meeting
[10:54:11] <agcolom> toddmparker__: ok, great. I'll add the create event to the popup docs. Thanks.
[10:54:47] <agcolom> johnbender: timing-wise, is it best I wait until you've done your big merge?
[11:02:07] <toddmparker__> gseguin: yep, i need to get the scoop from him on that
[11:05:15] <agcolom> toddmparker__: I have already put the RTL plugin on the resources page (last item in this section http://jquerymobile.com/resources/#Extensions)
[11:28:50] <scott_gonzalez> What's the question?
[11:28:57] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom johnbender
[11:43:14] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: do you guys support passing create bindings as arguments to all of the widget constructor calls?
[11:43:26] <johnbender> I think the question is only for initialization
[11:43:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, all widgets do automatically.
[11:43:40] <johnbender> hmm
[11:43:50] <scott_gonzalez> You can't possible not support it.
[11:44:00] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: that's what I thought
[11:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> s/possible/possibly/
[11:44:13] <johnbender> agcolom: which widgets were you having trouble with?
[11:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you do something stupid like overwrite this.options.create inside _create()
[11:44:30] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: we're sorting out some docs inconsistencies
[11:44:37] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: don't think so
[11:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> I highly doubt you do :-)
[11:45:16] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: alright, that's enough of an answer that I should be able to work with agcolom
[11:45:25] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: thanks!
[11:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> No problem. Let me know if you need help trackign anything down.
[11:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Who has the most knowledge of the various hit area/hit target discrepencies across browsers/devices?
[12:11:33] <agcolom> hi, sorry was having dinner!
[12:11:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: johnbender ^
[12:16:42] <agcolom> Popups and dialogs were inconsistent with all form widget and others:  checkboxradio, slider, button, listview, collapsible, collapsibleset, textinput, selectmenu.
[12:18:54] <agcolom> for now, there is no event documented for page loading widget (so which of the 2 above should we go with?)
[12:20:51] <johnbender> agcolom: I would just go with the create object property
[12:20:58] <johnbender> agcolom: less work converting :)
[12:22:38] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Don't spend time manually documenting examples for widget events.
[12:22:47] <scott_gonzalez> We'll just automate it like we did for options and methods.
[12:22:56] <agcolom> ok.
[12:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> If this is something you're actively working on, I can bump it up on my list.
[12:23:53] <agcolom> well, I think we want to release at the end the year... so no big rush... I'll just follow what you're doing then
[12:24:38] <scott_gonzalez> Are you aiming for jquerymobile.com EOY too? or just api.jquerymobile.com?
[12:24:45] <agcolom> johnbender: so is the widget name correct (to attach an event handler to a widget event or should it be bind or on?)
[12:24:47] <toddmparker__> scott_gonzalez: I may know some of the hit stuff. kinblas is the true expert there
[12:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker__: Ok, had lunch with Doug Schepers today and he was talking about trying to get this stuff standardized, so I said I'd get someone from the Mobile team in touch with him just to pass on any info you might have.
[12:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'll send an email pointing him to you and Kin.
[12:26:23] <toddmparker__> ok scott_gonzalez
[12:26:34] <toddmparker__> we can also test anything you need us to on real devices
[12:27:01] <toddmparker__> docs convention question for agcolom and scott_gonzalez
[12:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll pass that info on too.
[12:27:28] <toddmparker__> listview is a widget and there is an extension for the filter that is a separate file
[12:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: For widgets, the event name is always {eventPrefix}{callbackName}
[12:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> eventPrefix defaults to widgetName, but can be overridden per widget.
[12:27:48] <toddmparker__> how should we document these situations?
[12:28:03] <toddmparker__> In the current API docs, the filter stuff is pretty much built-in
[12:28:04] <toddmparker__> http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/listview/#option-filter
[12:28:22] <toddmparker__> but I wonder if/how to clarify that is an extension
[12:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker__: Perhaps just add a note on the filter docs.
[12:28:43] <scott_gonzalez> So in the description for the option, add a note.
[12:28:58] <toddmparker__> so document it as a whole thing like currently, but just note that it's an extension
[12:29:03] <toddmparker__> ok
[12:29:57] <toddmparker__> the reason I ask is we are working on the RWD table stuff and we had built this as a core table plugin that does basic manipulation stuff and two modes, each as extensions to either stack the table or offer a column chooser menu
[12:30:23] <toddmparker__> each mode will have different options and such
[12:30:48] <toddmparker__> we pulled these apart for modularity but documenting is trickier
[12:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:31:15] <scott_gonzalez> Are they meant to be exclusive?
[12:32:55] <agcolom> BTW, I'm revisiting all the widget options at the moment to use the auto generated examples... see http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/textinput/#option-disabled
[12:33:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: AFAIK each widget has a <widgetname>create event, because the common subclass fires such an event.
[12:33:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[12:33:29] <agcolom> is it ok to leave the initSelector option as is?
[12:34:13] <agcolom> have to help with homework for a bit...
[12:34:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: Are we going to do that option-weeding-out for 1.3?
[12:34:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: agcolom just asked about initSelector, which is a good candidate for making into a default rather than an option.
[12:36:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4974
[12:37:34] <_|Nix|_> So, css-corner-styling has all of its unit tests updated and passing. When do we merge?
[12:38:06] <toddmparker__> I think we can do that now unless it will interfere with any of johnbender's work
[12:38:12] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: agree with that?
[12:38:18] <toddmparker__> _|Nix|_ ^
[12:38:33] <johnbender> as long as your aren't touching nav :)
[12:38:42] <johnbender> even if you are go ahead
[12:38:48] <johnbender> I'll deal with it when I get to it
[12:39:07] <_|Nix|_> Not touching nav.
[12:39:17] <_|Nix|_> But we are adding a behaviour.
[12:39:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: I think uGoMobi's pings are timing out today.
[12:40:02] <_|Nix|_> Although I guess he did pong my previous ping.
[12:43:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: The RTL stuff is awesome! It's a big missing feature for sure.
[12:46:14] <_|Nix|_> Here's the final tally both without and with the new functional test: https://gist.github.com/4061763
[12:54:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: I'm inclined to merge the corners, since uGoMobi seems to be AFK ... what say you?
[12:55:01] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__: I'm equally willing to wait for him though ...
[13:03:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: back
[13:04:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping!
[13:04:23] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:05:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah let's merge!
[13:08:29] <agcolom> I'm back
[13:09:30] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom
[13:09:59] <uGoMobi> the merge _|Nix|_ is going to do means... new options :)
[13:10:47] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I added options shadow and corners for listviews (only applies to inset listviews)
[13:10:59] <uGoMobi> and option corners for collapsible
[13:11:08] <uGoMobi> and option corners for dialogs
[13:12:55] <uGoMobi> (corners for collapsibles only applies to inset collapsible)
[13:15:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Merging.
[13:15:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool!
[13:17:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll run the unit tests before pushing.
[13:18:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok. no merge conflicts?
[13:21:15] <agcolom> Hi Jasper!
[13:21:31] <uGoMobi> hi
[13:21:36] <agcolom> thanks for letting me know. I'll add that now to the api docs.
[13:22:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: great!
[13:23:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nope.
[13:24:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not much going on on master.
[13:24:20] <uGoMobi> yeah everyone is burried in branches
[13:25:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I figured you were working on that options --> behaviour branch with the long name so I didn't delete that one
[13:25:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I also looked at your Google Doc
[13:26:35] <agcolom> toddmparker__: I just realised that we could do with a new favicon on the resources page
[13:27:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't agree with "filterCallback doesn't need to be an option to be overwritable - it can be made into a behaviour"
[13:27:21] <uGoMobi> and same for autodividersSelector
[13:27:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You think it should be modifyable per-instance?
[13:27:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[13:28:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Then, we should clean it up a bit: var defaultFilterCallback = function() { ... }; ... options: { ..., filterCallback: defaultFilterCallback, ... }
[13:29:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Having a function declared inside the options is, like, ... brrrrr ...
[13:29:36] <uGoMobi> I see
[13:29:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But that's a minor thing.
[13:30:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess initSelector is the big one.
[13:30:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, no doubt about that one
[13:30:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... cuz that thing touches ALL the widgets!
[13:35:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just looked at the doc. Very cool! You filled out most of them! Thanks!
[13:36:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: np, nice doc:)
[13:36:22] <_|Nix|_> Thanks!
[13:36:47] <uGoMobi> fixedToolbar got some options we could discuss
[13:37:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker__, gseguin, johnbender, arschmitz_: Could you guys please also go over the doc at https://docs.google.com/a/intel.com/document/d/1n7ozvhQTLhBj6sPR-LYxuev3p8kcbHjlAM8EBMlQ8GE/edit and set/update some of those blanks?
[13:37:21] <uGoMobi> I agree that supportBlacklist doesn't need to be an option
[13:38:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No errors on the merge ...
[13:38:49] <_|Nix|_> ?BOOM
[13:38:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great!
[13:38:50] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[13:39:23] <_|Nix|_> jQM _|Nix| the corners have landed.
[13:40:16] * _|Nix|_ goes to lease an old nuclear bunker.
[13:40:26] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:41:31] <uGoMobi> let's not forget to delete the branch... I just cleaned up ;)
[13:42:11] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[13:42:45] <_|Nix|_> I got rid of it both locally and on github ...

[13:43:54] <uGoMobi> dang
[13:44:19] <uGoMobi> nice work
[13:44:56] <agcolom> uGoMobi: shadow and corners options for listview. That's not in the current docs yet is it?
[13:45:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: correct, it just became an option 2 minutes ago :)
[13:45:35] <agcolom> oh, ok ;-)
[13:45:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I can add them
[13:46:12] <uGoMobi> on options page and data-attribute
[13:46:26] <uGoMobi> and probably an example on the basics page
[13:46:49] <agcolom> ok, that'd be great. I'll add it to the api docs...
[13:47:01] <uGoMobi> ok perfect
[13:49:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll get rid of css-corner-styling-js-removal as well ...
[13:49:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's merged into css-corner-styling anyway.
[13:49:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I already deleted it from remote/origin
[13:49:56] <uGoMobi> you just got it local
[13:50:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ok, great!
[13:51:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I started with the methods examples for the API docs, but I am a bit worried about those iframes
[13:52:08] <agcolom> yes?
[13:52:42] <agcolom> you think there are too many of them or you're worried it won't work everywhere?
[13:52:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: can I test it local?
[13:52:47] <agcolom> yes
[13:54:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: is it the idea that those examples are created on the fly as well?
[13:54:51] <uGoMobi> if I look here http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.changePage/ I see empty demo blocks
[13:55:37] <uGoMobi> just trying to understand how these docs work, but I better clone the repo first
[13:58:09] <agcolom> uGoMobi: that's because I haven't got a proper demo yet
