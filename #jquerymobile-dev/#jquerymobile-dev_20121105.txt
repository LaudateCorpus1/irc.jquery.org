[04:06:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[04:06:59] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[04:08:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Do you think we could get rid of the class ui-controlgroup-last?
[04:09:20] <_|Nix|_> It adds a border to the last item in the controlgroup, but buttonMarkup removes that class when it re-enhances the button.
[04:09:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, if we are going to use CSS for all the corner styling we don't need it
[04:09:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, then I'll try to make this one small step in that direction.
[04:09:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: one difference though
[04:10:12] <_|Nix|_> What's that?
[04:10:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: IE7 doesn't support :last-child
[04:10:37] <uGoMobi> that's not an issue with the corner styling
[04:10:37] <_|Nix|_> Do we support IE7?
[04:10:52] <uGoMobi> because it doesn't support border-radius either
[04:10:53] <_|Nix|_> I thought IE8 was the last browser.
[04:10:57] <uGoMobi> yes we do support IE7
[04:11:03] <_|Nix|_> For how long?
[04:11:12] <_|Nix|_> :)
[04:11:37] <uGoMobi> but if we use :last-chilid to set the border instead of ui-controlgroup-last you won't see the border on IE7
[04:11:47] <_|Nix|_> I know, I know.
[04:12:01] <_|Nix|_> That's probably why we have that class.
[04:12:17] <uGoMobi> yup
[04:12:41] <uGoMobi> we have similar class for listviews
[04:13:42] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, but adding it in while trying to use .buttonMarkup() is not possible, because it gets removed when, for example, the last checkbox in a group gets checked.
[04:14:09] <uGoMobi> actually I think IE8 doesn't support :last-child either
[04:14:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I understand
[04:14:34] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, it's really nice to call .buttonMarkup({ icon: "checkbox-" + (input.checked ? "on" : "off" ) }) instead of hunting down the icon yourself, and hunting down the button yourself, etc.
[04:14:53] <uGoMobi> true
[04:14:57] <_|Nix|_> ... but then you lose ui-controlgroup-last ...
[04:15:10] <_|Nix|_> ... so I'll have to hack buttonMarkup some more :(
[04:15:36] <_|Nix|_> ... and break encapsulation by accessing its data from outside buttonMarkup :(
[04:15:38] <uGoMobi> we should discuss how long we keep supporting IE7&8
[04:15:44] <_|Nix|_> ... and all in the name of performance.
[04:16:02] <_|Nix|_> ... because we could use .removeClass() inside buttonMarkup, but that's slower than .className = ...
[04:16:02] <uGoMobi> and if we find a missing border acceptable as graceful degrading
[04:16:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, it's a regression, if you think about it.
[04:16:31] <uGoMobi> yes adding/removing classes is expensive
[04:17:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly, so I have to maintain a list of "extra classes" in the buttonMarkup's buttonElements data, and add those classes during .buttonMarkup() ...
[04:18:14] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, this might make it even better capable of handling special cases such as listviews ...
[04:20:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how do we proceed with the corner styling? I want to work on doing that with CSS instead of JS
[04:21:14] <uGoMobi> I am going to work in a branch
[04:21:50] <uGoMobi> but are you still working on that too?
[04:22:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, I'm done.
[04:22:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[04:22:44] <_|Nix|_> Also, WTF?! we're using .removeClass() in buttonMarkup()!
[04:22:52] <_|Nix|_> OK, great. This gives me a tool to work with.
[04:23:07] <_|Nix|_> We're only using .className for inner classes.
[04:24:22] <uGoMobi> if something needs to be as fast as possible it is buttonMarkup()
[04:24:58] <_|Nix|_> No doubt.
[04:25:15] <_|Nix|_> ... and yet it still uses .removeClass() ... but only on one element.
[04:25:25] <_|Nix|_> ... and I think my fix for #3637 has introduced this bug.
[04:25:50] <_|Nix|_> ... so maybe I don't need to hack buttonMarkup anymore, but just fix the fix :)
[04:26:44] <uGoMobi> :)
[05:24:26] <arschmitz> Morning uGoMobi: , _|Nix|_:
[05:24:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: morning!
[05:25:01] <arschmitz> Have a good weekend?
[05:25:39] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[05:26:03] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, pretty cool ... got down to fixing controlgroup non-enhancement issues ...
[05:26:28] <arschmitz> nice, i pretty much spent the weekend on my presentation
[05:26:39] <_|Nix|_> I dunno what's going on with the branch previews ... I made some changes over the weekend and my branch preview still isn't showing the changes :(
[05:27:02] <arschmitz> lame i thought johnBender fixed that last week
[05:27:37] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... I dunno what's going on ...
[05:27:59] <arschmitz> Thats frustrating
[05:28:07] <_|Nix|_> I added some php to prepend the git commitid when using js/index.php and I'm still not seeing it ...
[05:28:30] <_|Nix|_> I don't really want to merge the branch that fixes controlgroups until I'm certain that the branch preview is running the commit with the fix.
[05:28:54] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[05:29:18] <_|Nix|_> ... and it looks like /test is using jquery.mobile.js whereas the branch previes are using js/ ...
[05:29:49] <_|Nix|_> ... so, they're using index.php, which does not send the commitid as part of the source file, unlike jquery.mobile.js, which is built.
[05:30:39] <arschmitz> yeah i think the branch previews are just straight copyes of the repo and test is an actual build
[05:31:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've gotten rid of some class manipulation code in checkboxradio and replaced it with calls to .buttonMarkup() ... the icon for check- and radiobuttons isn't being set via addClass/removeClass anymore, but vie .buttonMarkup({icon: theRightValue})
[05:31:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great!
[05:32:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not corner classes, but it's still important, if we want to confine class manipulation code.
[05:33:11] <uGoMobi> yeah, same goes for "theme"
[05:34:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ideally, if I can convert all class manipulation to calls to .buttonMarkup(), then, when the CSS is ready, we can simply rip the stuff out of .buttonMarkup() and it will still work.
[05:35:07] <_|Nix|_> ... but checkboxradio still does some .addClass().removeClass() stuff for ui-radio-active ...
[05:35:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you mean to switch the icon?
[05:35:59] <uGoMobi> ui-radio-active doesn't sound healthy BTW :)
[05:36:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. The icon is switched using .buttonMarkup(), but if I don't do the .addClass().removeClass() then the background of the icon will be grayscale rather than blue.
[05:36:28] <_|Nix|_> I know, eh?
[05:36:33] <uGoMobi> ah ok, get it
[05:36:34] <_|Nix|_> Super-powers and everything ...
[05:36:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, the class turns on some special-casing probably.
[05:37:07] <uGoMobi> yeah... your button might become bright green
[05:37:12] <_|Nix|_> :)
[05:37:22] <_|Nix|_> Nono, that's theme: "f" :)
[05:37:29] <uGoMobi> haha
[05:40:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: :checked is a CSS selector
[05:40:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe we can do that with CSS too
[05:40:40] <_|Nix|_> That'd be nice!
[05:40:59] <uGoMobi> but the enhanced element can't be selected with :checked of course
[05:41:21] <uGoMobi> only the native, so I am not sure if this would be possible
[05:41:31] <_|Nix|_> Oh, right ...
[05:41:54] <_|Nix|_> It there a :next CSS selector?
[05:42:08] <_|Nix|_> If so, we could just make sure that the native element always precedes the widget ...
[05:42:15] <_|Nix|_> ... but that's probably weak.
[05:43:07] <uGoMobi> no but you can select an element immediately preceded by a specific selector
[05:43:46] <uGoMobi> :checked ~ .myselector { }
[05:44:18] <_|Nix|_> Cool ... well ... *shrug* ... I suppose that /might/ constitute a solution ...
[05:44:36] <uGoMobi> but this is CSS3 stuff so we would run into old IE problems
[05:45:10] <_|Nix|_> IIIIIIIEEEEEE!!!!

[05:47:09] <uGoMobi> as long as Win XP is still used by so many people the same will probably go for IE8, since you can't run IE9 on XP
[05:47:29] <arschmitz> Hey dont feel to bad i work at a place where ~70% of the employees are forced to use ie7
[05:48:10] <uGoMobi> they are all jealous at you arschmitz ?
[05:48:40] <arschmitz> LOL generally but people here dont even know what i do
[05:48:48] <uGoMobi> haha ok
[05:48:57] <_|Nix|_> I would like to take this opportunity to express my disdain at IE and M$.
[05:48:57] <arschmitz> im the only person in my company that even knows html
[05:48:59] <uGoMobi> maybe just keep it that way ;)
[05:49:33] * _|Nix|_ 's eyebrow twitches ...
[05:49:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ha ha job security i suppose
[05:50:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What does your company do?
[05:50:15] <arschmitz> chain of car dealerships
[05:50:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice! Almost as far away from tech as possible :)
[05:50:47] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah!
[05:51:35] <arschmitz> i sit in my office behind multiple monitors and all anyone knows is i do "web stuff"
[05:53:55] <arschmitz> The upshoot is i work directly for the general manager who gives me 100% freedom to work on what i want.
[05:54:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: As long as you don't break the Web site, eh?
[05:54:50] <arschmitz> exactly
[05:54:56] <_|Nix|_> Nice setup!
[05:55:07] <arschmitz> Yup and they pay to send me to whatever i ask
[05:55:13] <arschmitz> they paid for me to go to the summit
[05:55:24] <_|Nix|_> Good stuff ...
[05:55:48] <arschmitz> yeah not what you would expect from a chain of car dealerships
[05:56:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I can totally imagine that.
[05:56:36] <arschmitz> i also write other applications and stuff for them too quoting tools, accounting stuff all sorts of random things i think up lol
[05:56:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I used to work at Ford's Windsor Engine Plant.
[05:57:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I totally know what it's like when people think what you do is black magic.
[05:57:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Nice and exactly
[05:58:02] <arschmitz> I even made them an automated text message response system for customers to get information on cars.
[05:58:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sweet!
[05:58:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Did you write an ASCII backend for webkit? :)
[05:58:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Access the Web site via SMS :)
[05:59:07] <arschmitz> HA HA no far simplier then that
[05:59:17] <_|Nix|_> :)
[05:59:28] <arschmitz> just tunnel an email address to a php interpreter
[06:00:46] <arschmitz> simple but effective and free
[06:03:44] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[06:04:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Yup i get to make some pretty nifty little things some times.
[06:04:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also gives me time to work on stuff like this
[06:05:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Since i use jQuery Mobile quite a bit for stuff here i considder it in our best intrest to support it.
[06:10:01] <_|Nix|_> Definitely.
[06:23:11] <arschmitz> Ugh i think i was so worried about my presentation not being long enough not im going to have to cut and consolidate a lot

[06:44:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I'll take a look... talk to you later
[07:36:39] <uGoMobi> ?tell _|Nix|_ : the radio & checkbox horizontal controlgroups now have icons which they are not supposed to have. Compare the examples at the bottom of those pages: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/checkboxes/ and http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/forms/checkboxes/

[09:19:31] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you around?
[09:22:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: hi
[09:44:40] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi
[09:44:47] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker
[09:44:56] <toddmparker> been tinkering more on theming and markup simplification
[09:44:59] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/ejejak/20/edit
[09:46:12] <toddmparker> i think we can have a basic, non-themed version for power users
[09:46:54] <toddmparker> then use smarter css scopes to directly apply theme swatches, corners, etc. via classes
[09:47:24] <toddmparker> in that example, we have auto-rounded corners from your bin plus theme inheritance for free
[09:48:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah looks good
[09:49:09] <uGoMobi> we can make it much simpler but is a big change
[09:49:39] <uGoMobi> I am in favor though
[09:50:08] <toddmparker> yeah, post 1.3, I think we need to make a bigger change
[09:50:26] <toddmparker> before UI adopts our theme framework
[09:50:30] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: you here?
[09:51:05] <toddmparker> The main thing is I see _|Nix|_ spending cycles writing even more complex JS for corners and control groups that should be done with pure css
[09:51:10] <uGoMobi> I am working on CSS corner styling for controlgroups now
[09:53:31] <uGoMobi> maybe some things were done with JS because of lack of CSS3 support on some supported browser
[09:54:12] <toddmparker> I think a lot of that was IE 6/7 which was more relevant 2.5 years ago
[09:54:18] <toddmparker> we're not enhancing those now
[09:54:31] <uGoMobi> yeah I think so
[09:55:11] <toddmparker> great you're looking at that!
[09:55:29] <uGoMobi> the checkbox and radio controlgroups are a bit more complicated
[09:55:43] <uGoMobi> because we wrap it so many divs
[09:56:32] <toddmparker> I'd like to re-look at that too
[09:56:53] <toddmparker> Wilto did a lot of stuff like this for a client project so he's going to look a bit more at this today
[09:57:40] <uGoMobi> i will push the branch after I made some progress
[10:04:10] <Wilto> Hi.
[10:17:40] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I added a simple horizontal control group example
[10:17:41] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/ejejak/21/edit
[10:17:55] <toddmparker> I think we can really speed things up and simplify code
[10:18:15] <toddmparker> and make it both easy to theme via TR and to do totally custom stuff
[10:18:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: it is very simple, but the checkbox radio and select make it more complicated
[10:19:28] <uGoMobi> the button of the first checkbox etc is not first child but last child
[10:19:46] <uGoMobi> sounds strange I know
[10:22:10] <uGoMobi> the hidden input is first child of it's parent
[10:22:30] <uGoMobi> s/it's/its
[10:25:04] <toddmparker> updated: http://jsbin.com/ejejak/22/edit
[10:25:23] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yeah, that one is trickier for sure
[10:25:26] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'm going to be offline most of today
[10:25:31] <johnbender> my daughter somehow managed to get sick again
[10:25:34] <toddmparker> ok johnbender
[10:25:38] <toddmparker> sorry to hear that
[10:25:51] <johnbender> not a big deal
[10:25:58] <johnbender> just that someone has to look after her
[10:26:18] <toddmparker> hope she's feeling better
[10:26:19] <johnbender> and my wife was on vacation for the last something like the last 2 weeks
[10:26:29] <johnbender> toddmparker: thanks
[10:26:30] <toddmparker> tis the season for non-stop colds
[10:27:21] <johnbender> toddmparker: I was told this might happen when she started at a daycare/school but holy jesus

[12:01:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: Hi sorry wasent around. _|Nix|_ was saying his defer-controlgroup-enhancement branch wasent updating this weekend.
[12:20:20] <agcolom> Good evening!
[12:22:02] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[12:22:51] <agcolom> Hi Jasper! I need your help to build some examples... When is a good time?
[12:24:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sure, what kind of examples are you looking for?
[12:24:25] <agcolom> uGoMobi: dead simple ones!
[12:24:49] <agcolom> just to illustrates events...
[12:25:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ah ok
[12:25:32] <agcolom> no, sorry not events! methods! so I have now written quite a few methods in teh api docs... but I need proper examples...
[12:25:53] <agcolom> http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/category/methods/
[12:26:27] <uGoMobi> agcolom: and those examples need to go in an iframe?
[12:27:08] <agcolom> for those one, the iframes will get created automatically, so ideally I'm after a jsbin that I can just copy !
[12:28:29] <agcolom> also, what do  changePage and loadPage return? (and also silentScroll?)
[12:29:59] <agcolom> I have copied there some code from the old docs... so I'm just after something simple to illustrate that code... so maybe just a button with an event that will then call the method...
[12:32:30] <agcolom> toddmparker: Good evening... We now have an index page, just like UI... http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/ what would you like to see on that index page?
[12:35:09] <agcolom> uGoMobi: No big rush :-) just when you have time... maybe if you can come up with one example for changePage and jQuery.mobile.path.isAbsoluteUrl() then maybe I can modify them to produce the other examples if you prefer...
[12:39:47] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sorry, was on the phone for a moment... I will create some examples this week
[12:40:14] <agcolom> uGoMobi: You're a star!!!! Thank you so much!!!!!
[12:40:56] <uGoMobi> about what they return...  an object or technically I think it's a reference to an object
[12:41:20] <uGoMobi> better check with _|Nix|_ or johnbender before you document that ;-)
[12:42:23] <agcolom> great thanks!
[12:44:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: did you ever check a new docs example on an iPad?
[12:45:30] <uGoMobi> just asking because I got the impression that iOS and iframes are not best friends
[12:48:14] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I did and all the iframes actually work fine :-)
[12:48:59] <uGoMobi> cool!
[12:49:14] <agcolom> the only issue is the code that reamains quite big but we're looking at alternatives for code highlighting and that's one of the things that I'll keep an eye on when testing...
[12:49:27] <agcolom> (in the code examples)
[12:50:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I used the same code highlighter as the API for the demos
[12:50:54] <uGoMobi> I just adjusted font-size and line-height and made lines wrap
[12:51:09] <agcolom> that sounds good!
[12:51:11] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/css-corner-styling/docs/demos/
[12:51:31] <uGoMobi> you can see an example there
[12:52:24] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What do you need to check with me?
[12:52:24] <bot-t> (5 hours 15 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell _|Nix|_ : the radio & checkbox horizontal controlgroups now have icons which they are not supposed to have. Compare the examples at the bottom of those pages: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/checkboxes/ and http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/forms/checkboxes/
[12:54:03] <_|Nix|_> ^ Oh great ... another special case ...
[12:54:27] <agcolom> uGoMobi: That works very nicely (text wrapping!)
[12:54:54] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Hi! I would like ot check with you what do the following methods return?
[12:55:04] <uGoMobi> agcolom: couldn't fix that with CSS so had to do it with JS unfortunately :(
[12:55:24] <agcolom> (options are nothing, jQuery, Object, and then the standard Boolean, String, etc.)
[12:55:48] <agcolom> $.mobile.changePage()
[12:56:11] <agcolom> $.mobile.loadPage()
[12:56:35] <agcolom> (actually all the one on that page: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/api/methods.html
[12:56:54] <uGoMobi> jQuery is an object isn't it?
[12:57:28] <agcolom> sorry, yes
[12:57:36] <agcolom> (I think!)
[12:58:06] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ ! I am done with controlgroup and listview CSS corner styling http://jquerymobile.com/branches/css-corner-styling/docs/demos/controlgroups/index.html
[12:58:17] <uGoMobi> only have to do collapsibles
[12:58:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nice!
[12:58:40] <uGoMobi> good opportunity to make corners an option for inset collapsibles
[12:58:52] <agcolom> so all of those, unless it has a return value section such as $.mobile.path.isRelativeUrl()
[12:58:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, lemme get this straight ... you did this without :last-child?
[12:59:33] <uGoMobi> no, I did this with :last-child and :first-child
[13:01:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... OK, and that's OK, because IE < 9 doesn't have corners anyway, right?
[13:01:09] <uGoMobi> exactly
[13:01:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, great!
[13:01:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/controlgroup.png
[13:01:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's on Chrome Version 22.0.1229.94
[13:01:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: only problem to use last:child to set the border for the last element, cos IE<9 do have borders :)
[13:02:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think toddmparker mentioned the same about the icon only buttons
[13:03:16] <uGoMobi> not related to those changes
[13:03:42] <uGoMobi> don't see it on Win7/Chrome, will check on Linux/Chrome
[13:04:05] <uGoMobi> I saw a lot of redering issues with Chrome lately
[13:04:53] <uGoMobi> this has to with the em values we use for top/bottom padding.... Chrome doesn't round off which is causing differences
[13:07:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:i have chrome canary on win 7 and i can see it
[13:07:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I figured out why there are icons. Turns out checkboxradio does a sneaky thing: icon = input.parents( ":jqmData(type='horizontal')" ).length ? undefined : uncheckedState,
[13:08:06] <_|Nix|_> So, it actually checks its parents ...
[13:13:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ do you see the issue with the controlgroup / icon only button in Firefox as well? or only Chrome?
[13:13:53] * _|Nix|_ go check
[13:14:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In FF the problem is the opposite: The middle button is not as tall as the outer two buttons.
[13:15:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ___-----_____
[13:15:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's FF12/Linux
[13:19:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Firefox 16 on windows 7 is the same as chrome
[13:20:08] <uGoMobi> yeah I see the same issues now on Linux
[13:21:37] <uGoMobi> on Win7 I only saw it on Opera, not on Chrome, FF, Safari, Internet Explorer
[13:22:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: strange i see in both chrome and firefox on windows 7
[13:22:54] <uGoMobi> weird indeed
[13:23:15] <arschmitz> for chrome im on canary so that could be it
[13:23:39] <arschmitz> but firefox im just on whatever the most recent release is.
[13:26:25] <uGoMobi> do you see border-bottom on the last fieldcontain here? http://jsbin.com/atahip/29
[13:27:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I do on my FF but not on my Chrome.
[13:27:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you inspect the code on Chrome you see 1px solid for the bottom border
[13:28:02] <uGoMobi> but you don't see it
[13:28:06] <uGoMobi> another Chrome bug
[13:35:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I do see border-bottom-width: 1px ...
[13:35:32] <agcolom> Bedtime for me... I think I may be coming down with the flu :-( Speak soon...
[13:35:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, the border is just not in view :(
[13:35:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This rule applies: .ui-li-last, .ui-li.ui-field-contain.ui-li-last { border-bottom-width: 1px; }
[13:36:05] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Good night!
[13:36:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good night and don't get the flu!!
[13:36:13] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Drink tea with honey and lemon.
[13:36:31] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: And eat toast with lots of garlic.
[13:37:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, what, the page is too short?
[13:37:16] <agcolom> Thanks! Goodnight as well :-) I think I may have worked a bit too hard at the weekend ;-) and slept really badly last night!
[13:38:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the container element is a bit too short

[13:39:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Listviews are notorious about being wider and taller than their dimensons claim that they are.
[13:39:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, they have negative margins or something.
[13:40:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, OK, it's visible: http://jsbin.com/atahip/122
[13:40:46] <toddmparker> hey all
[13:40:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Hey!
[13:41:05] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: those pages look good…so are you switching over to css for all this business?
[13:41:08] <toddmparker> hey _|Nix|_ !
[13:41:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in the code inspector select the last fieldcontain and then check "metrics" http://jsbin.com/atahip/29
[13:41:56] <uGoMobi> you will see values like 34.426461452521571295757185px
[13:42:07] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: hi
[13:42:26] <uGoMobi> yes, only the collapsibles aren't done yet
[13:42:49] <uGoMobi> going to make corners an option for inset collapsibles if you don't mind
[13:43:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, people are going to assign corners using CSS?
[13:43:23] <uGoMobi> no
[13:43:26] <toddmparker> so can you guys fill me in on where we're at on all these changes?
[13:44:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we still need the JS to add class "ui-corner-all" or "ui-btn-corner-all"
[13:44:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm pretty sure I've got a working fix for the broken select groups, but the branch preview refused to update.
[13:45:00] <_|Nix|_> Can someone please kick the branch preview updater?
[13:45:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but you don't need to fix that if we are going to use CSS
[13:45:35] <toddmparker> so here's my question: seems like uGoMobi is using css selectors to inherit corners correctly so no need to use JS to calculate this anymore, that right?
[13:45:55] <toddmparker> if so, do we just need to take on the corner class on the field contain and call it day?
[13:46:13] <toddmparker> and if that's the case, can we simplify all this new code from _|Nix|_
[13:47:09] <_|Nix|_> OKOK ... let's do it like this. Let's merge my branch, which will give us working corners the old-fashioned way, and then let's merge uGoMobi's which will obviate the need for much of that code.
[13:47:19] <_|Nix|_> I think that's the more incremental approach.
[13:47:50] <toddmparker> so add it and remove it?
[13:47:58] <uGoMobi> but the next step for me would be removing all corner styling from JS
[13:48:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: My code is necessary, because otherwise the controlgroup thinks it has 0 buttons.
[13:48:29] <uGoMobi> only thing buttonMarkup needs to do is add class ui-btn-corner-all to buttons
[13:48:30] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: do you think we can handle all the field contain stuff by setting a corner class on the parent and routing corners via inherit on chill elements?
[13:48:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Again, what if I want to have a button with a top left corner.
[13:49:01] <_|Nix|_> ?
[13:49:03] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: can you point me to the code
[13:49:22] <_|Nix|_> Hold on ... too many moving parts ...
[13:49:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: 3 square corners and 1 rounded corner on one button?
[13:49:50] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: we don't support that now, so changing the code to add the feature to specify specific corners isn't important IMHO
[13:50:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/L2LEJg
[13:50:27] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/master 1ba5c6c Gabriel Schulhof: [controlgroup] Delay registration of enhancement hook until dom-ready...
[13:50:29] <toddmparker> right now, we support a binary choice: covers on the outside edges or no corners
[13:50:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We do support that: .buttonMarkup({corners: "tl"})
[13:50:33] <uGoMobi> I would set corners to false and just add that corner style to my custom CSS
[13:50:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The good news is that support has not yet been released.
[13:51:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you are right, but we never documented it
[13:51:17] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-options.html
[13:51:25] <toddmparker> $('a').buttonMarkup({ corners: false });
[13:52:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's the problem though. If you add that corner style to your custom CSS, then you have to know the internal structure of the button, because you have to add the corner style to .ui-btn as well as .ui-btn-inner.
[13:52:11] <toddmparker> Right uGoMobi - we should move in the direction of not using JS for this stuff and relying on classes and custom css
[13:52:28] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: that is all part of the html simplification we need to do
[13:52:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: the point of corners: "something" was that you don't need to inspect the generated DOM to see where you need to add your classes. buttonMarkup does it for you.
[13:52:50] <toddmparker> so instead of adding complexity to make the overly complex markup we have now more configurable
[13:53:12] <toddmparker> i'd much rather make smaller changes to remove JS and move towards CSS like we can do for corners for 1.3
[13:53:34] <toddmparker> and for 1.4 or later,w e can re-do the markup and styles to basically avoid the need for as much markup
[13:53:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if we make those inner elements inherit by default you only have to set it for the .ui-btn element
[13:53:56] <_|Nix|_> I'm all for that, but as soon as a single usecase requires the dev to go in and check the DOM that we have generated in order to achieve the look they want, we have failed.
[13:54:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. That's actually great!
[13:54:17] <toddmparker> the current markup and styles are problematic
[13:54:23] <toddmparker> but we can't solve that right now
[13:54:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Re: fieldcontain... yes that should be possible as long as there are no elements that we don't of between the fieldcontainer and the element that should inherit the corner styling
[13:55:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The problem is, in some cases the outermost element is one we generate.
[13:55:17] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: these buttons and control groups and list views have way simpler markup and styles = no JS = no need for enhancement and refresh methods
[13:55:18] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/ejejak/22/edit
[13:55:45] <toddmparker> We can, for example, get rid of the need for the btn-inner and just use a inset box shadow for the glow
[13:56:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, great!
[13:56:16] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: and that's the case now - the corners are on direct children
[13:56:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: here you can see it https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/css-corner-styling/css/structure/jquery.mobile.listview.css#L22
[13:56:57] <toddmparker> exactly. that is the kind of change I want to make, not add more js
[13:57:11] <toddmparker> now all we need to do is tack on the corner class on the UL and call it a day
[13:57:12] <uGoMobi> I don't use the class ui-btn-corner-all... just route the corner style to the inner element, this could also be "no corner style"
[13:57:25] <toddmparker> as you add and remove list items, the corners adjust
[13:57:45] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the containers already get ui-corner-all
[13:58:23] <uGoMobi> so we only have to remove all JS that add specific corner classes
[13:58:39] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #821: FAILURE in 19 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/821/
[13:59:10] <uGoMobi> collapsibles are a bit different case, but I can have those done by tomorrow
[14:00:49] <_|Nix|_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/selects/index.html should now be correct.
[14:01:02] <_|Nix|_> IOW, ready to rip out the JS.
[14:01:57] <_|Nix|_> Wow! This will be so much less code.
[14:02:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: like I said, buttonMarkup should only add a corner class for "real" buttons, not for listviews or controlgroups
[14:03:36] <uGoMobi> the controlgroup function/widget should simply add clas "ui-corner-all" if data-corners="true"
[14:03:59] <uGoMobi> same goes for the listview plugin
[14:04:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: controlgroup doesn't have an options data-corners ...
[14:04:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: controlgroup doesn't use buttonMarkup for itself, but only for the children.
[14:04:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and the children are real buttons.
[14:05:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but with your modifications, it should not be necessary for controlgroup to do anything.
[14:05:19] <uGoMobi> ok, then we have to see what is the best way to get that class on the controlgroup div
[14:05:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: $el.addClass( "ui-corner-all ui-controlgroup" );
[14:06:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's part of the code of controlgroup.
[14:06:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It adds that class to itself.
[14:06:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, the JS can be very simple... option corners true/false --> add or don't add ui-corner-all
[14:06:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, then we leave it like that
[14:06:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, the code we can yank is refresh() and flipCorners()
[14:06:57] <_|Nix|_> Sorry ... _flipClasses()
[14:07:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[14:07:16] <_|Nix|_> This is awesome!
[14:07:52] <toddmparker> yep, soooo much simpler
[14:08:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and if you don't want corners on your controlgroup you just add this to your CSS... .ui-controlgroup.ui-corner-all { border-radius: 0 !important; }
[14:08:32] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi, wilt, scottjehl__ and I are going to take a hatchet to the HTML and CSS to really skinny things down
[14:08:46] <toddmparker> but this one change is a massive improvement
[14:08:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: However, I still think we should keep the options that buttonMarkup currently has. Just because we don't make use of them, doesn't mean we shouldn't provide them, especially since this is a small increment on top of what buttonMarkup already provides.
[14:08:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: great!
[14:09:05] <toddmparker> we should look through the code for any other places where we might be assign JS classes in JS
[14:10:02] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: I'm not so sure. we should support true/false for whether that class is written, but why add more complexity?
[14:10:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I can think of couple of things but not sure what we define as graceful degrading since IE7/8 don't support :last-child
[14:10:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's just it. It doesn't add much complexity to buttonMarkup, because it merely replace a lookup table of size 2 with a lookup table of size 10.
[14:11:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's the use of buttonMarkup that was adding complexity.
[14:11:00] <uGoMobi>  ui-controlgroup-last, ui-collapsible-last and something similar for last list-item
[14:11:21] <uGoMobi> mostly for border styling of last element
[14:11:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: You still need to look up which class to add based on the value of data-corners ...
[14:12:02] <toddmparker> on the IE7/8 question, it doesn't support border-radius anyway so it won't be affected, right?
[14:12:09] <toddmparker> square either way
[14:12:14] <_|Nix|_> Thank goodness!
[14:12:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: correct
[14:12:26] <ryanneufeld> hey guys
[14:12:42] <_|Nix|_> What's up?
[14:12:43] <uGoMobi> but we use classes to work around other thing too... like adding border to last list item
[14:12:50] <toddmparker> ok, next question…making the lookup table go from 2 to 10 seems like a fair amount more complexity
[14:12:51] <uGoMobi> hey ryanneufeld
[14:12:59] <toddmparker> hey ryanneufeld
[14:13:08] <ryanneufeld> I'd like to add a couple more icons to the default icon pack, is there some thing special I need to know for retinization?
[14:13:57] <toddmparker> ryanneufeld: nope, just make sure your retina sprite is exactly 50% the size of SD
[14:14:04] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: if you use png I would say just double the size
[14:14:24] <ryanneufeld> 50% the size of a SD? so make it smaller?
[14:14:28] <ryanneufeld> or 50% bigger?
[14:14:32] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: if all we need on our side is whether to add the corner-all class to the parent...
[14:14:37] <uGoMobi> 100% bigger :)
[14:14:40] <ryanneufeld> oic
[14:14:47] <toddmparker> oops, HD 200% of the SD
[14:14:52] <toddmparker> yeah, sorry
[14:15:16] <ryanneufeld> ah, okay, so I need to mod the 18 and 36 px sizes

[14:18:35] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: People (with better sense of aesthetics than myself) might want to do something like this: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/461
[14:18:58] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[14:18:58] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #822: FIXED in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/822/
[14:20:06] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: I can see that is convenient but you can do the same with css
[14:20:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Then I hope we don't axe ui-btn-corner-tl and friends.
[14:20:49] <toddmparker> the thinking is that having JS to config styling is bad so adding more power to that approach is probably a step in the wrong direction
[14:20:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: What about buttons?
[14:21:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: In case of a button, the actual input becomes hidden, so you cannot add class="ui-btn-corner-tl" to it.
[14:21:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I deleted all those tl tr bl br classes in the theme CSS
[14:22:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, the only way to add a single corner is to browse through jquery.mobile.css and look up the values we use for the border radii and then use the same values?
[14:22:29] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:22:39] <toddmparker> well, the other way works too
[14:22:48] <uGoMobi> actually you can set the radii with ThemeRoller
[14:22:49] <toddmparker> add the corners and juts negate the radii
[14:23:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Again. What about buttons?
[14:23:15] <toddmparker> this will all get easier when we don't wrap as many things
[14:23:37] <toddmparker> this has buttons with various radii or none - http://jsbin.com/ejejak/22/edit
[14:23:51] <toddmparker> since nothing is wrapped, you just add the classes you want or make some new ones
[14:23:58] <uGoMobi> I think that people that are going to apply specific styles to elements have enough CSS knowledge to make this happen
[14:24:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: In the case of buttons, the native input is completely hidden, and the visible button is completely generated and a sibling of the native input.
[14:24:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I already made that work with selects
[14:24:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But as it stands, even people with no knowledge of CSS can apply really cool styling ...
[14:25:02] <uGoMobi> where it is even more complicated
[14:25:24] <uGoMobi> we can add demos to the docs
[14:25:31] <uGoMobi> to give people some insights
[14:26:01] <toddmparker> here is an odd button for ya
[14:26:02] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/ejejak/23/edit
[14:26:25] <toddmparker> make a class that sets some corners to 0, add it to your button
[14:26:29] <uGoMobi> and like I said... I can set the ui-btn-inner and ui-btn-text element to inherit by default
[14:26:48] <uGoMobi> so you just have to set it for the outer ui-btn element
[14:26:50] <toddmparker> for folks who know css, this is easy
[14:27:03] <toddmparker> and we can provide demos like uGoMobi said
[14:27:13] <toddmparker> .gabriel-button  {
[14:27:14] <toddmparker>   -webkit-border-top-left-radius:0;
[14:27:15] <toddmparker>   -moz-border-radius-topleft:0;
[14:27:17] <toddmparker>   border-top-left-radius:0;
[14:27:18] <toddmparker>   -webkit-border-bottom-right-radius:0;
[14:27:20] <toddmparker>   -moz-border-radius-bottomright:0;
[14:27:21] <toddmparker>   border-bottom-right-radius:0;
[14:27:21] <toddmparker> }
[14:27:27] <toddmparker> that is verbose because of vendor prefixes, but hey
[14:27:54] <uGoMobi> so we take of the more complicated stuff like this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/css-corner-styling/css/structure/jquery.mobile.controlgroup.css#L46
[14:28:07] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we don't -moz anymore
[14:28:15] <toddmparker> it's just a new feature to set specific corners and I don't want to add stuff to that feature because it's a dead end
[14:28:17] <uGoMobi> only -webkit for older iOS and Android
[14:28:25] <toddmparker> i hope to kill the corner JS option soon
[14:29:18] <toddmparker> right, uGoMobi - that is a good example of how we can stack up a ton of selectors and set some children to not have corners based on their position (first, last)
[14:31:18] <uGoMobi> same for listview where I set border-radius inherit for the appropiate corners for ui-li-thumb and the split-button
[14:31:30] <toddmparker> if you add these features, then we'll feel beholden to support them in the new system nd that isn't worth it imho
[14:33:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Look, I'm all in favour of removing the corners option, but only if the resulting path is equally simple for the user.
[14:34:15] <Wilto> you guys are talking about css without me
[14:34:18] <toddmparker> in the re-write, you might go from data-corners="true" to class="corners"
[14:34:21] <toddmparker> same diff
[14:34:22] <Wilto> does this mean I’m fired again y/n_
[14:34:32] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:34:41] <toddmparker> hell, we can even keep the data attars but not touch them with js
[14:35:03] <toddmparker> [data-button=true] { styles to add corners  }
[14:35:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Will <input type="button" class="corners"> have the right effect?
[14:35:19] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, Todd and I were talking about this a little while ago.
[14:35:34] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: when we're done, it should
[14:35:58] <toddmparker> that is a tricker one but we can figure out a simple convention
[14:36:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see 3rd button from top http://jquerymobile.com/branches/css-corner-styling/docs/demos/buttons/
[14:36:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and how would you turn off one of the corners on that button? You'd have to write a really fancy CSS selector, right?
[14:36:39] <_|Nix|_> ... one that applies to the next sibling.
[14:37:03] <toddmparker> jQM.Next = less wrapping of elements, little/no JS markup decoration and JS applied conditional classes
[14:37:13] <Wilto> Yeah. I was saying, I think if we did more styling against attribute selectors we could cut out a hell of a lot of JS that’s only in play for the sake of moving classes around, with no difference on the “author” side.
[14:37:38] <uGoMobi> I will add border-radius inherit for ui-btn-inner and ui-btn-text
[14:37:44] <toddmparker> in my example above, I made a gabriel-button class that set border-radius on corners to 0 and added it to the button
[14:37:49] <toddmparker> easy peasy
[14:38:04] <Wilto> [data-corners="false"] { border-radius: 0; }
[14:38:13] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: we have $.mobile.ns ... is that only used in unit tests?
[14:38:23] <Wilto> [data-corners="false"], [data-corners="false"] > * { border-radius: 0; }
[14:39:00] <toddmparker> that is a reason why using data attars instead of classes for these is trickier
[14:39:03] <toddmparker> ns
[14:39:07] <Wilto> Hm; yeah. We’d lose namespacing.
[14:39:43] <Wilto> …I wonder how many people use it.
[14:39:54] <toddmparker> anyway, i haven't heard feature requests for setting corners on buttons
[14:40:09] <Wilto> A sensible default might work wonders there, if we held off data-attr-based styling for a more appropriate version.
[14:40:10] <toddmparker> so this seems like a solution to a problem that isn't
[14:40:23] <Wilto> ?mlm
[14:40:24] <bot-t> much like myself
[14:40:59] <_|Nix|_> L8R all - me go bed.
[14:41:41] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: it would be really awesome if you could work with uGoMobi to hunt down places where we can remove JS code for corner classes once we writes these new styles
[14:41:51] <toddmparker> goodnight _|Nix|_
[14:42:24] <uGoMobi> good night _|Nix|_
[14:44:35] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: keep plugging away with the forensic de-JSification of corner classes
[14:44:46] <toddmparker> good stuff and will be way faster and more robust
[14:45:14] <uGoMobi> yeah I am totally in favor
[14:45:42] <uGoMobi> and with the new demos test pages it easy to see if we cover all cases
[14:46:20] <uGoMobi> so it's just collapsibles and then removing all the superfluous JS
[14:47:07] <uGoMobi> and keep looking for other things we can port from JS to CSS
[15:13:11] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: we need to use the hell out these more advanced selectors too
[15:13:12] <toddmparker> http://kimblim.dk/css-tests/selectors/
[16:56:21] <gseguin> Did you guys see this: http://maker.github.com/ratchet
[16:58:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I did
[16:58:26] <johnbender> I don't get it :(
[16:59:15] <gseguin> neat demo page
[16:59:20] <johnbender> gseguin: ah yes
[16:59:25] <johnbender> I agree
[16:59:31] <johnbender> scrolling is all the rage these days :P
[17:00:42] <gseguin> heh
[17:00:51] <johnbender> gseguin: I love saying that
[17:01:07] <gseguin> also unrelated, but I really like the idea of what Malte presented at JSConf.EU
[17:01:16] <gseguin> the module server thing
[17:02:02] <johnbender> gseguin: ahh, the google folks?
[17:02:07] <gseguin> yeah
[17:02:15] <johnbender> I watch the talk but it was hard to see the slides in the overflow room
[17:02:26] <johnbender> the fact that they had an overflow room was mindblowingly awesome
[17:02:31] <johnbender> and I was late to the talk
[17:02:34] <johnbender> I'll have to rewatch it
[17:02:50] <gseguin> it's pretty awesome
[17:03:30] <gseguin> https://github.com/google/module-server
[17:05:39] <johnbender> gseguin: this is what happens when people are allowed to pursue a very specifi problem in their work hours :)
[17:05:54] <gseguin> heh
