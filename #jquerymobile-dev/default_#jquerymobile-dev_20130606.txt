[12:33:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker: any idea when will work for you to catch up this weekend?
[12:44:50] <arschmitz> johnbender: you still here?
[12:45:21] <johnbender> arschmitz: yessir
[12:46:12] <arschmitz> would you say its currently supported to call change page durring inital page init?
[12:46:32] <johnbender> no
[12:46:39] <arschmitz> ok thats what i thought 
[12:46:47] <johnbender> I would say it's a bad idea in general
[12:46:50] <johnbender> it might work 
[12:46:51] <johnbender> I don't know
[12:46:54] <johnbender> but I doubt it
[12:46:56] <arschmitz> have people complaining about broken logic for popstate when they do it
[12:47:12] <johnbender> hmm
[12:47:12] <arschmitz> and just wanted to double check i was right about it not being supported
[12:47:26] <johnbender> arschmitz: what issues
[12:47:34] <johnbender> I'm curious what these people are doing 
[12:47:41] <johnbender> and how/if we shold support it
[12:47:57] <arschmitz> https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&shva=1&zx=veq7rkjtg1xp#inbox/13ee0e8a4fd74654
[12:48:00] <arschmitz> oops
[12:48:02] <johnbender> :)
[12:48:26] <arschmitz> that wont get you far ...
[12:48:46] <arschmitz> hmmmm github isnt loading
[12:49:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: not a big deal
[12:49:05] <johnbender> arschmitz: just curious
[12:49:15] <johnbender> I probaby won't get a chanc to ook at it until the conf next week anyway
[12:49:28] <arschmitz> yeah basicly
[12:49:39] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: you guys are both going to be there right?
[12:49:39] <arschmitz> they are calling change page on inital pageinit event
[12:49:45] <arschmitz> yup
[12:49:50] <johnbender> arschmitz: but why is the question
[12:49:58] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool we can chat about what's left to do with the nav refactor
[12:49:59] <arschmitz> login form
[12:50:06] <johnbender> I'm worried I won't get it done before 1.4
[12:50:09] <johnbender> which isn't an issue
[12:50:12] <johnbender> we can still merge it
[12:50:13] <arschmitz> i told them to use toPage on beforepagechange
[12:50:15] <johnbender> but there's more to do
[12:50:29] <johnbender> arschmitz: shouldn't they be redirecting at the server level o.O
[12:50:33] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok well anything i can help with i will
[12:50:36] <johnbender> dick answer 
[12:50:39] <johnbender> lol
[12:50:48] <arschmitz> yeah they are doing weird stuff
[12:50:50] <johnbender> arschmitz: that's the correct way to do it
[12:51:00] <johnbender> intercept and load a different url or page
[12:51:06] <arschmitz> yeah thats what i told them and they continued to complain about broken logic
[12:51:17] * johnbender rolls his eyes
[12:51:19] <johnbender> oh well
[12:51:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll be in Portland, yes.
[12:51:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool
[12:51:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: looking forward to dumping all this nav work on you lololol
[12:51:36] <arschmitz> yeah just wanted to be 1oo% it was not supported before i answered again
[12:51:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: :)
[12:51:59] <arschmitz> johnbender: always happy to help here too
[12:52:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't think I'm going to be able to finish before 1.4 sowe'll have to merge and continue after 
[12:52:09] <johnbender> arschmitz: you too
[12:52:11] <johnbender> absolutely
[12:52:14] <johnbender> the more the merrier
[12:52:28] <johnbender> the path to completion is fairly straight forward
[12:52:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP.
[12:52:37] <johnbender> but it'll be good to sit down and talk about it
[12:53:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, if you've kept the unit tests verdant, it should really be straight forward :)
[12:53:10] <arschmitz> yeah make sure everyone is on the same page with how it is / will work
[12:54:20] <arschmitz> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6042
[12:56:02] <arschmitz> im just going to comment again to use a popup thats what they are describing to one guy and that sorry not supported to the other guy
[12:57:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Loading a dialog/popup during initial page load isn't going to work unless history is turned off for that one sequence.
[12:57:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know
[12:57:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Use a popup with data-history="false"
[12:58:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: or bind to changepage not pageinit
[12:58:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or changePage to the dialog with options.changeHash = false.
[12:59:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... this is actually exactly the correct solution, because the user isn't supposed to be able to nav to the front page anyway, given the OPs use case.
[12:59:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, going "Back" from the dialog/popup will land the user on their previous Web site, as expected.
[12:59:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, dismissing the popup/dialog via the "Back" button is not required, nor wanted.
[13:01:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for the op i think the correct solution is to bind to pagebefore change
[13:01:17] <arschmitz> and modify toPage
[13:01:28] <arschmitz> the it loads the dialog as the first page
[13:01:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh you mean for the initial page. Not bad either. Not bad at all!
[13:02:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, wait. What if you then log in and go "Back"?
[13:02:07] <arschmitz> yeah and the other poster should bind to pagechange and open popup from there
[13:02:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Will that get you to the front page?
[13:02:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it will load the front page as he says he wants then open the popup
[13:03:06] <arschmitz> and its after pageshow and everything is done so it will work
[13:03:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono. I'm saying after the user has logged in via the popup/dialog and then the user hits "Back".
[13:03:36] <agcolom> btw I've been playing with sliders too, but only to play with colors... 
[13:03:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for op it will go to whatever the last page they were on was
[13:03:56] <arschmitz> for the other person it would take them to the inital page
[13:04:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's not necessarily good. With changePage + options.changeHash: false, it will go back to the front page.
[13:04:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess we should probably set up some demos with this stuff.
[13:04:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How to show a dialog/popup off the front page.
[13:04:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they want it to show instead of the front page they dont want the user to be able to get to front page
[13:04:59] <arschmitz> until after they login
[13:05:04] <agcolom> uGoMobi: you still around?
[13:05:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, but once the user has logged in and gone to some other page, they should be able to go /back/ to the front page.
[13:05:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[13:05:26] <arschmitz> they will be able to just like any other page in history
[13:05:41] <agcolom> oh good. Do you need anything for your workshop, or is it all finished now?
[13:05:44] <arschmitz> they want the inital dialog to go to the front page after its submitted
[13:06:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it's finished, but thanks!
[13:06:03] <agcolom> (I have some lecture notes, perfect for beginners)
[13:06:10] <uGoMobi> it was this morning
[13:06:25] <agcolom> ok. don't hesitate in future if you need anything... 
[13:06:28] <uGoMobi> I am gonna make some changes to my talk for tomorrow though
[13:06:50] <uGoMobi> now I know a bit more about the public
[13:07:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks a lot, will do!
[13:07:10] <agcolom> yes, it's really difficult when you don't know your audience!
[13:07:27] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:07:29] <agcolom> what is your talk about tomorrow?
[13:07:40] <uGoMobi> jQM + RWD
[13:07:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aaaah, OK.
[13:08:00] <uGoMobi> today was more JQM general
[13:08:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, it basically unlocks the front page.
[13:08:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right
[13:08:20] <arschmitz> i think this is for an app
[13:08:29] <agcolom> sounds good!
[13:08:30] <arschmitz> so if they are already logged in it just goes into the app
[13:08:38] <arschmitz> if not it takes them to a login screen
[13:08:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's actually dumb UX because once logged in, the front page likely has to display some personalized stuff.
[13:08:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom: just have to make sure it's still interesting if you don't know JQM at all
[13:08:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So it'd be better to have a dedicated login page.
[13:09:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i agree
[13:09:12] <agcolom> yes, you need to make them want to use JQM ;-)
[13:09:22] <arschmitz> but im not here to judge they ux just to tell them its not supported :)
[13:09:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah :)
[13:09:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm poking around a bit with jsbin ... 
[13:09:55] <uGoMobi> for sure :)
[13:11:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: with a dialog http://jsbin.com/ayumal/27/edit
[13:12:04] <arschmitz> thats for second poster that wants the dialog to be over the page
[13:13:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man! The dialog appears, disappears, reappears and stays. Chrome 27.
[13:13:28] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:13:45] <arschmitz> thats because it happenes inbetween the first and second pagebeforechange
[13:14:10] <arschmitz> because nav isnt fully initalized yet so it cant que it 
[13:25:06] <agcolom> guys, is there a way to easily disable a JQM radio button without the "disabled" look (faded)
[13:28:40] <arschmitz> agcolom: agcolom yes
[13:29:02] <arschmitz> you can add css pointer-events:none; to the label
[13:29:02] <agcolom> how? (please :-) )
[13:29:14] <arschmitz> agcolom: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/825/edit
[13:29:17] <agcolom> OMG! that is soooo easy!!!!
[13:29:20] <arschmitz> its inline there
[13:29:22] <agcolom> thank you!!!!
[13:29:24] <arschmitz> better to use a class
[13:29:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: that wont work in old ie though
[13:30:07] <agcolom> That's ok! 
[13:30:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You can still tab over to the radio button though and hit space or enter, can't you?
[13:30:23] <agcolom> It's for an app I want to build for my students! 
[13:30:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i think so
[13:31:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but to prevent that is a lot more work 
[13:31:25] <arschmitz> without altering the style
[13:31:29] <agcolom> that's ok. Will try on my example.... 
[13:32:14] <agcolom> see, this is where I was a few days ago: http://users.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jqm/tryMySlider3.html 
[13:32:44] <agcolom> so I don't want them to be able to change the decision (pass/fail/referred)
[13:32:59] <agcolom> as they could do it by mistake...
[13:33:13] <arschmitz> agcolom: this will prevent touch / mouse from changing
[13:33:21] <arschmitz> but if they use tab key they could
[13:33:33] <arschmitz> they could tab to it then press space
[13:33:55] <agcolom> that's ok. It's mainly for the ipad or other tablets...
[13:34:02] <arschmitz> cool
[13:34:25] <agcolom> also it will be only a "tool" for students to get an idea of their performance
[13:34:52] <arschmitz> agcolom: cool that should be enough then
[13:35:31] <arschmitz> agcolom: in your fav browser firefox you can add -moz-user-focus:ignore; to prevent tab key
[13:35:45] <agcolom> so once they enter all their 3 years, they can play a bit with the marks using the sliders and see the effect on their degree classification and what they need in the remaining components to pass/get a 1st class, etc...
[13:36:02] <agcolom> perfect! Thanks again!
[13:36:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: cool
[13:36:13] <agcolom> what do you think of the sliders with the colors?
[13:36:49] <agcolom> I find them really efficient on the iphone.... so I'm surprised about the comments I've seen on github!
[13:37:18] <arschmitz> i like that
[13:37:32] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah iphone they work fine its android
[13:37:45] <arschmitz> android they are often pretty bad
[13:38:26] <arschmitz> agcolom: i really like the slider color and interactions with fail pass referral
[13:38:31] <arschmitz> its slick
[13:38:38] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[13:39:16] <arschmitz> and since changing the fail/pass does not actually do anything i think the pointer-events should be plenty
[13:39:26] <agcolom> you can also see what is missing (with the info in the collapsible), which changes also
[13:39:44] <agcolom> That is great yes, thanks again!
[13:39:45] <arschmitz> very cool
[13:40:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If the person wants to cover the login screen, they can always set the opacity of the popup's screen to 1.
[13:40:13] <agcolom> I hope that will help them! Now I need to add the 3 years * 8 modules! 
[13:40:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean cover the front page, not the login screen.
[13:40:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah they want it to be visible through
[13:40:46] <arschmitz> thats why i suggested popup instead of dialog
[13:40:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[13:40:51] <arschmitz> as thats what its made for
[13:40:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Indeed ...
[13:41:30] <arschmitz> back in 1.1 before popup i did exactly what they are for something and had a dialog with a transparent background to fake popups
[13:41:43] <arschmitz> its a bad way to go lol

[13:42:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was able to get away without a setTimeout by doing a $.mobile.window.one( "navigate", function( e ) { e.preventDefault(); } ); before opening the popup.
[13:42:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know it's awkward, but hey! It's better than nothing.
[13:42:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool
[13:43:00] <arschmitz> yeah if it was not first page you dont need a time out at all if you use pagechange
[13:43:09] <arschmitz> but on very first page you do
[13:43:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just investigated what event was causing the popup to close and said: ORLY? Well then preventDefault you too!
[13:43:27] <arschmitz> lol
[13:43:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no navigate event when its not the first page
[13:44:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think all tests in "next" should be green now!
[13:44:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: WOO HOO!
[13:44:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome!
[13:44:23] <uGoMobi> yihaa
[13:44:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: when we are together next week we should work on tabs too make final css decision and merge
[13:45:14] <_|Nix|_> Yep!
[13:45:17] <arschmitz> that ones just been chilling in its branch for a long time
[13:45:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right
[13:46:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that WP8 issue looks really nasty
[13:46:21] <arschmitz> im frightened if its widespread 
[13:46:26] <uGoMobi> also have to look at panels, want to make it work without wrapping and reduce 3D-ing
[13:46:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah for sure
[13:46:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: speaking of that
[13:46:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah that WP8 issue looks bad
[13:47:03] <arschmitz> i was thinking about when you use a panel with no pages at all not just outside pages
[13:47:21] <arschmitz> should we support push and reveal or just only support overlay
[13:47:30] <uGoMobi> just got a WP8 device but gave it to my father so he can try WP8 before bying a Lumia 920 while I am in the US
[13:48:05] <arschmitz> because trying to make them work having no idea what the content they are siblings with is could be pretty hard to make work and look good
[13:48:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good question, I think we can only support push and reveal when we know what we have to transition
[13:48:46] <arschmitz> that was my thought overlay only if no page is found at all
[13:48:47] <uGoMobi> that's gonna be hard when there is no page
[13:49:23] <uGoMobi> agreed
[13:49:27] <arschmitz> i need to add that logic into the panel i didnt think about it durring the inital pass
[13:49:55] <arschmitz> not a big deal just something i thought of thats a potential issue
[14:01:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ johnbender gseguin : did any of you follow the convo about https://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-mobile-architecture-documentation here on -dev?
[14:01:34] <uGoMobi> danielvdende sent me some Q's via email
[14:01:48] <gseguin> uGoMobi: nope, sorry
[14:02:13] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok thanks
[14:06:09] <arschmitz> Iv been following
[14:06:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There was a convo about it? *scratch head*
[14:06:52] <arschmitz> A bit yeah I was not part of it but I read it
[14:07:21] <uGoMobi> right, I was talking with danielvdende here
[14:07:49] <uGoMobi> here is a link to his public repo https://github.com/danielvdende/jqmArchitecture
[14:08:56] <uGoMobi> He is asking 1. If we have any idea how we want to do performance tests. They have certain ideas but want to make sure it matches with what we want
[14:09:42] <uGoMobi> 2. How we would like to receive results... simple numbers or statistic analyses or something in between
[14:10:26] <uGoMobi> 3. deadline 1.4 release... I will answer planning on alpha early July
[14:10:44] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... we need to interact with Google Maps O_o
[14:11:06] <uGoMobi> and he asks about changes in "next"... I will answer that
[14:11:22] <_|Nix|_> Like, when jQuery selectors fail, you turn to Google maps to find your element?
[14:13:35] <_|Nix|_> Oh ... to be a student :)
[15:34:13] <toddmparker> I had a bag 'o phones to give to arschmitz for y'all
[15:49:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: awesome!
