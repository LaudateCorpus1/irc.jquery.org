[00:16:47] <johnbender> kinblas: alright
[00:17:06] <johnbender> kinblas: I've got windows phone and android covered and it's super easy to add user agent strings and version regex's
[00:17:25] <johnbender> that is substrings of user agent strings like Android and Windows Phone OS
[00:17:43] <johnbender> tomorrow I'll split the graphs out and push the changes
[00:18:03] <kinblas> ok, I'm goin' to bed, I'm not thinkin' clearly at the moment

[09:05:09] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: ^^ per your request it now tracks user agents though I need to add support for ios and blackberry
[09:05:27] <kinblas> johnbender: great!
[09:06:44] <gseguin> good morning
[09:06:54] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/speed/stats/perf.js#L9
[09:07:04] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/speed/stats/perf.js#L70
[09:07:28] <johnbender> those are the two spots for adding new user agent OS's and version regex's
[09:07:47] * gseguin takes notes
[09:08:08] <johnbender> I got windows phone and android in there to the best of my knowledge
[09:08:21] <johnbender> I'm going to google the bb ua
[09:08:27] <johnbender> unless someone wants to hook me up
[09:08:28] <johnbender> same with ios
[09:08:33] <johnbender> since I'm not sure about the simulator
[09:09:04] <kinblas> johnbender: can you record the UA if I hit the test page?
[09:09:13] <kinblas> or do you want me to send you the UA in an email?
[09:09:53] <johnbender> kinblas: it records it, but that will muddy the data a tad
[09:10:05] <johnbender> which I can easily clean out if necessary
[09:10:06] <johnbender> kinblas: one sec
[09:10:12] <johnbender> let me make sure the changes are pushed to latest

[09:17:43] <johnbender> gseguin: is that for perf?
[09:17:48] <johnbender> seems like a big change
[09:17:57] <gseguin> that too
[09:18:22] <gseguin> I "just" moved code around
[09:19:04] <gseguin> that also takes care of a bug on collapsible sets
[09:19:42] <eddiemonge> johnbender: yeah stuff isnt getting pushed to the cdn or /test/ quite yet
[09:20:00] <eddiemonge> still need my last pr merged and the github postcommit hooks updated
[09:20:00] <gseguin> and when we do the builder, one can use collapsible without necessarily wanting collapsible sets

[09:21:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: too late :(
[09:21:53] <toddmparker_> we had a way to detect BB5
[09:21:55] <toddmparker_> heh, ok

[09:22:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I just decided to go ua strings since we'd need the versions anyway
[09:23:12] <toddmparker_> gseguin: great, you fixed that custom select menu?
[09:23:26] <gseguin> toddmparker_: the header, yes
[09:23:59] <toddmparker_> so the small custom menu doesn't have a header, right?

[09:25:26] <toddmparker_> sorry, just checked and it does
[09:25:32] <toddmparker_> did you land this?
[09:25:34] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/forms-all.html
[09:25:37] <johnbender> eddiemonge: you need 3009 merged?
[09:25:45] <toddmparker_> the custom select at the bottom still has a honkin' header
[09:26:05] <toddmparker_> compared to rc2 gseguin
[09:26:05] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc2/docs/forms/forms-all.html
[09:26:10] <Wilto> “added iPhone and iPad UA strings”
[09:26:23] <Wilto> oh god oh god i know what they’re for but oh god my mind
[09:26:26] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I didn't do it
[09:26:48] <gseguin> are you sure /test is up to date?
[09:26:50] <toddmparker_> what did you change in that fix?
[09:26:54] <toddmparker_> not sure
[09:27:10] <toddmparker_> so in your local, this looks ok or were you fixing something else?
[09:27:29] <gseguin> looks ok on my local
[09:27:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: I think test is delayed
[09:27:50] <gseguin> gray background for the header and normal sized font
[09:27:59] <johnbender> eddiemonge: danheberden responded to your request
[09:28:15] <eddiemonge> johnbender: we were working it out privately
[09:28:27] <danheberden> johnbender after some cybering, we got it figured out
[09:28:47] <eddiemonge> johnbender: and yes to 3009
[09:29:08] <toddmparker_> oh, i see it's fixed in master
[09:29:21] <toddmparker_> thanks gseguin
[09:29:27] <toddmparker_> so test is busted again??
[09:29:31] <gseguin> you're welcome

[09:30:16] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: todays outage is because of me
[09:30:30] <eddiemonge> i changed the processes and needed two changes made to clear it up
[09:31:02] <toddmparker_> ok, you working on that?
[09:31:57] <eddiemonge> yup finishing it up now so it all runs smoothhhhhh
[09:32:25] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: did you know the changes would break test when you submitted it? We could have waited for it to be baked before pulling it in
[09:32:29] <toddmparker_> kk
[09:32:56] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: there was one change i didnt know would break it
[09:33:22] <toddmparker_> k
[09:38:19] <johnbender> kinblas: if you want to hit the test page with a blackberry I could use that to sort out the UA string
[09:38:37] <johnbender> I'll just remove the confusing data point afterward
[09:38:59] * kinblas whips out his torch
[09:40:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: can you connect an iphone and an ipad to the lists perf page?
[09:40:50] <johnbender> I want to make sure I got the UA setup there right
[09:40:56] <johnbender> I went off some info I found on the internets
[09:41:21] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: oh, I also added the ability to refine the data by agent and datapoint
[09:41:40] <kinblas> johnbender: hit
[09:42:10] <kinblas> johnbender: I have an ipad 1st gen running 4.3.5 and iPhone 4 running 5
[09:42:28] <johnbender> kinblas: ugh they don't have an os version to parse
[09:42:41] <johnbender> only the phone model #
[09:44:01] <johnbender> oh well

[09:54:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3015 from eddiemonge/patch-9 - John Bender
[09:55:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: its a single data point, I had to dumbe the old data to refine for the user agent
[09:55:19] <johnbender> *dump
[09:55:33] <johnbender> well technically I _didn't_ but it was easier this way :(
[09:55:40] <toddmparker_> where is it plotted? maybe i'm goin' blind
[09:55:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: its not empty, its jus a single data point
[09:58:49] <johnbender> I would have liked to do the User Agent manipulation on the DB side but string manipulation in sql is a tad harder than in JS
[10:00:09] <johnbender> and since we need to aggregate the data by the UA it would have to be robust enough to pull the information out for grouping
[10:00:12] <johnbender> which it's really not
[10:01:02] <johnbender> anyway
[10:01:20] <johnbender> that meant I had to add the new column on and use that for aggregation which meant that yesterday's data was useless

[10:19:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] remove id dependency on the data point - John Bender
[10:19:23] <kinblas> The reason I ask is because of code like this: item.add( item.children( ".ui-btn-inner" ) ).addClass( itemClass );
[10:20:38] <kinblas> itemClass can be a single class, or multiple classes depending on what type of listview item we are talking about

[10:22:13] <Wilto> kinblas: I mean… I try to avoid it as a general rule.
[10:22:42] <Wilto> But technically speaking, it would only be for the sake of IE6. Granted, that’s just off the top of my head—I’m not sure how support is across older devices and obscure browsers.
[10:22:51] <Wilto> Which… Is probably why we’re avoiding it.
[10:22:56] <kinblas> Wilto: ok, I was just trying to reduce the number of items we are placing the same set of classes on ... especially when they are immediate descendants
[10:23:06] <kinblas> right historically we avoided because of IE6
[10:23:47] <Wilto> IRCCloud is killing me here.
[10:24:03] <Wilto> Mm—but there’s that “unknown unknowns” thing again.
[10:24:59] <Wilto> If it’s really out of hand on certain elements, I wonder if we might try that “detach/reattach post-DOM-shenanigans” approach?
[10:26:17] <Wilto> We could always set up a test page and give multi-class selectors a try on a bunch of stuff, too.
[10:26:55] <Wilto> I miss having development problems that I could just Google.

[11:11:03] <johnbender> garann: can you view that url?
[11:12:12] <garann> johnbender: not sure - stupid thing keeps signing me in with my work account, and when i switch it dumps me in my stream
[11:12:17] <toddmparker_> i'm so uncoool. never used any of this google+  stuff
[11:12:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: this is my first time
[11:12:32] <eddiemonge> garann: log out of google, log into the account you want then try
[11:12:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: as a side note it appears to be working much better than skype
[11:13:10] <garann> eddiemonge: heh, it prompts me to log in with my work account
[11:13:25] <eddiemonge> garann: do you have google+ with that other thing?
[11:13:35] <garann> which other thing?
[11:14:11] <Wilto> how do i hangout guys help
[11:14:16] <eddiemonge> i meant other account

[12:04:23] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gseguin (18h, 1m ago): Decoupled collapsible and collapsible set
[12:04:52] <garann> i think i missed this - where do we report performance stuff?
[12:05:03] <garann> just jump in and try to fix it?
[12:05:57] <gseguin> garann: if you have identified a performance problem you can file a PR, a jsperf to back it up is ideal
[12:06:51] <gseguin> check with kinblas and johnbender first if they're not already it though
[12:06:52] <garann> ok, cool
[12:09:41] <kinblas> garann: do you have a specific use case? does it still happen on the HEAD?
[12:10:38] <kinblas> If you aren't sure where the slow down is happening, I can help you profile it.
[12:11:11] <garann> kinblas: when i open a popup on this thing http://www.motorola.com/Business/US-EN/Business+Product+and+Services/Tablets/ET1+Enterprise+Tablet
[12:11:24] <garann> it's taking a while to actually show it as a popup
[12:11:33] <garann> shoes as a normal page for a couple seconds
[12:11:40] <garann> *shows
[12:11:57] <kinblas> hmmm, what version of jqm is that app using?
[12:12:13] <kinblas> garann: is the dialog an embedded page? Or an ajax'd one?
[12:12:15] <garann> just the public site
[12:12:54] <kinblas> garann: so that URL uses jqm if I load it on a mobile device?
[12:13:27] <garann> ah, no, sorry
[12:13:45] <garann> this page: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc2/docs/pages/multipage-template.html
[12:13:51] <garann> the other link is the device
[12:14:47] <kinblas> garann: if you try that same page at /test/
[12:14:51] <kinblas> do you have the same problem?
[12:15:33] <kinblas> garann: and is that an android device?
[12:15:55] <Wilto> GitHub down for anyone else?
[12:16:08] <garann> kinblas: sorry, where does /test/ go?
[12:16:30] <kinblas> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/multipage-template.html
[12:16:39] <garann> aha
[12:16:43] <kinblas> garann: /test/ is basically in sync with the HEAD
[12:16:49] <garann> let me check - it is android
[12:16:51] <kinblas> "bleeding-edge"
[12:17:17] * kinblas tries it on his zoom
[12:18:03] <kinblas> Wilto: fine and dandy for me

[12:23:35] <garann> kinblas: can't get to that url
[12:23:46] <garann> what version of android is the xoom?
[12:23:51] <garann> this thing is 2.3.4
[12:24:03] <garann> don't know if that makes a difference
[12:24:06] <kinblas> garann: oh hmm, I'm running 3.2
[12:24:17] <kinblas> garann: do you still see the problem with /test/
[12:24:18] <kinblas> ??
[12:25:21] <garann> no, works now
[12:25:38] <garann> works on both counts
[12:25:44] <kinblas> Yay? :-)
[12:25:47] <garann> still slow when it closes the popup
[12:25:56] <kinblas> yeah that is something to look at
[12:26:00] <kinblas> the problem there is a "back"
[12:26:06] <kinblas> simply does a window.back()
[12:26:16] <kinblas> which means we have to wait for the browser to dispatch the hashchange event
[12:26:22] <kinblas> which could take several milliseconds
[12:26:24] <garann> aha
[12:26:43] <kinblas> if you're clicking the close button
[12:26:58] <kinblas> you are at the mercy of the browser firing the click event (some 300ms after touchend)
[12:27:07] <kinblas> and then you have to wait for the hashchange event
[12:27:23] <kinblas> so hopefully you notice a difference between browser back button and jqm back button
[12:27:30] <kinblas> the browser one should be faster
[12:27:34] <kinblas> ... slightly ...
[12:28:00] <garann> yeah, slightly
[12:28:13] <kinblas> garann: so the original perf problem you mentioned ... is not a problem with the HEAD ... right?
[12:28:20] <garann> yeah, correct
[12:28:26] <garann> sorry for the false alarm :)
[12:28:28] <kinblas> ok good, thanks, just wanted to clarify
[12:28:29] <kinblas> whew
[13:04:04] <rubial> well how can i set the page a background image which covers the whole screen even if image is smaller
[13:05:53] <johnbender> rubial: you might want to try #jquery for that kind of question
[13:06:25] <rubial> i am using jquery mobile for developing a mobile webapp
[13:14:32] <kinblas> toddmparker_: wilto: I just sent you guys the phonegap email, cc'd Brian Leroux
[13:26:47] <toddmparker_> holy carp kinblas
[13:26:53] <toddmparker_> that this all written and stuff
[13:27:02] <toddmparker_> copy > paste > done
[13:27:12] <toddmparker_> that's "rough notes"
[13:27:37] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I usually agonize over every sentence for hours, so yeah that's rough
[13:27:47] * kinblas hates writing docs :-P
[13:28:41] <toddmparker_> rubial: try the #jquerymobile channel, this is for the team to chat
[13:31:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I read "Joe Binder" as "John Bender" and wondered why I was getting an email from myself
[13:32:11] * johnbender is a narcissist

[14:16:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile - jblas@adobe.com
[14:39:08] <toddmparker_> wowie kinblas
[14:39:19] <toddmparker_> so i got this email from application craft
[14:39:22] <toddmparker_> Don't use the following CSS if you have a button on the page. It completely kills performance and results in terrible scrolling. There is nothing inherently wrong with jqm but the end result makes it LOOK as if it is. We used this CSS because we want to control stuff like focus cosmetics etc.
[14:39:22] <toddmparker_> :active {
[14:39:22] <toddmparker_> 	outline:none
[14:39:22] <toddmparker_> }
[14:39:30] <kinblas> yeah I saw that
[14:39:42] <toddmparker_> wonder if that's true
[14:39:48] <kinblas> at the meeting today, I was going to say it would be interesting to notate things like that
[14:39:58] <kinblas> especially the difference in scrolling performance with gradients
[14:40:00] <kinblas> without
[14:40:03] <toddmparker_> yeah
[14:40:05] <kinblas> etc
[14:40:27] <toddmparker_> i was thinking of making the disc an image, just don't know if that's too big a change now
[14:40:35] <toddmparker_> will affect ThemeRoller too
[14:41:05] <toddmparker_> i really didn't see a big diff. with gradients, but hey
[14:42:33] <toddmparker_> so kinblas - is he saying it's slow with this rule IN?
[14:43:16] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah
[14:43:23] <kinblas> I don't know if it's just using :active
[14:43:28] <kinblas> or if it's the turning off of the outline
[14:44:52] <kinblas> hey todd, another thing I see that is inconsistent
[14:44:54] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[14:44:58] <toddmparker_> worth testing
[14:45:07] <kinblas> ?? taking it out?
[14:47:06] <toddmparker_> just try and see what's up
[14:47:34] <toddmparker_> hey all - why do we have a /css/themes folder and a /themes/ folder too?
[14:47:44] <toddmparker_> shouldn't the latter be nuked
[14:48:10] <kinblas> toddmparker_: in a fresh cloned tree there is no /themes/
[14:48:29] <toddmparker_> ah, really? ok, must be my local
[15:01:06] <toddmparker_> kinblas: i'll be dammed
[15:01:14] <kinblas> ??
[15:01:16] <toddmparker_> that does seem to speed it up
[15:01:24] <kinblas> great!!
[15:01:42] <kinblas> so what's the implication here? Blue outlines when inputs are focused?
[15:01:47] <toddmparker_> we set that in 4 places: http://jquerymobile.com/test/css/themes/default/
[15:01:52] <toddmparker_> search for outline:
[15:01:57] <toddmparker_> maybe
[15:02:07] <toddmparker_> this biggie is we set this on the page
[15:02:27] <toddmparker_> and header/footer
[15:02:33] <toddmparker_> look in core css
[15:02:47] <kinblas> toddmparker_: but is it the :active? or is it the actual outline property that's causing the slowdown?
[15:02:58] <toddmparker_> bah
[15:03:05] <toddmparker_> at least we know why it's there
[15:04:16] <kinblas> toddmparker_: well it's at least worth mentioning in some doc
[15:04:29] <toddmparker_> been testing this on the 400 item list
[15:04:41] <toddmparker_> i removed the 4 instances and am comparing to test
[15:05:10] <johnbender> kinblas: live/die will be in 1.8
[15:05:24] <kinblas> johnbender: whew ok
[15:05:36] <kinblas> I haven't been keeping up with what's different between live/on
[15:06:13] <johnbender> alright
[15:06:18] <johnbender> my preso is pretty much ready
[15:06:24] <johnbender> time to look at pull requests
[15:08:16] <toddmparker_> so kinblas - do you think this is worth looking into more?
[15:08:38] <kinblas> only if you want to remind yourself why we put it there :-)
[15:08:52] <toddmparker_> heh
[15:09:01] * kinblas vaguely remembers scott and him talking about it back in 2010
[15:09:13] <toddmparker_> actually, maybe it's not better
[15:09:18] <toddmparker_> this stuff is hard to test
[15:09:21] <kinblas> maybe it's wishful :-)
[15:09:36] <kinblas> heh I've been doing a lot of that lately with the perf stuff
[15:09:44] <toddmparker_> most of the hiccups are when rendering isn't there
[15:09:45] <kinblas> but I have to go by the numbers to be sure
[15:09:56] <kinblas> right
[15:10:17] <toddmparker_> flicking up and down within a section of the list that is rendered is fast
[15:10:39] <toddmparker_> but you keep hitting that render wall where the tile isn't there and the scrolling hangs
[15:11:11] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/DnUBxA
[15:11:11] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #2919 from redaemn/flip-switch-improvements - John Bender
[15:13:49] <toddmparker_> so kinblas - what is the best trick to force the whole page to be rendered?
[15:14:06] <kinblas> rendered?
[15:14:07] <toddmparker_> -webkit-transform: rotateY(0); type of thing
[15:14:10] <kinblas> oh
[15:14:17] <toddmparker_> ready to rock 'n roll
[15:14:21] <toddmparker_> you know
[15:14:32] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I should send you my little blog exerpt I've been sitting on
[15:14:35] <kinblas> it's a bit complicated
[15:14:35] <toddmparker_> the dif. between that and backface visibility?
[15:14:46] <kinblas> hang on let me send it to you
[15:15:03] <toddmparker_> i was just going to put that on the listview perf page to see if it blows up and how it looks
[15:15:06] <toddmparker_> k
[15:15:12] <kinblas> oh ok
[15:15:16] <kinblas> so what you have to do is this
[15:15:48] <kinblas> li { -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0) };
[15:16:22] <kinblas> basically you have to fake translate  items less than 1024px in both dimensions
[15:17:03] <toddmparker_> so you set that on the LI, not the parent UL or page?
[15:17:29] <toddmparker_> = you can only apply this to items smaller than 1024 square
[15:18:03] <toddmparker_> does the rotateY work the same way? I see Scott put that in if touchOverflow is in play
[15:19:01] <toddmparker_> woah. if i add that to the page, i see a low res bitmap of the page
[15:20:52] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I sent you something, it explains why you can't put it on the page
[15:20:55] <kinblas> or the UL
[15:21:21] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah same thing
[15:21:26] <kinblas> rotateY is in the 3d realm
[15:21:32] <toddmparker_> ok so if i do this:
[15:21:33] <toddmparker_> .ui-listview li { -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0) }
[15:21:34] <kinblas> so it creates a cached bitmap for that element
[15:21:45] <toddmparker_> there are fewer scrolling hiccups
[15:21:58] <toddmparker_> but the page does take a while to be usable
[15:22:01] <kinblas> toddmparker_: right, at the expense of memory
[15:22:10] <kinblas> too bad we don't have a tool to show the spike
[15:22:11] <toddmparker_> right
[15:22:11] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #247: SUCCESS in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/247/
[15:22:12] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jblas: Reclaiming another 700-800 msecs on the 400 listview item test for WP7.5 (Mango) with a few minor tweaks:
[15:22:19] <toddmparker_> didn't crash my phone tho
[15:22:41] <kinblas> toddmparker_: if you put one on the UL as well, I'll be it does :-)
[15:23:03] <toddmparker_> i'd prolly get that bitmap thing
[15:23:20] <toddmparker_> know what i mean? on an iphone 4, you get a super low res image of the screen
[15:23:38] <kinblas> toddmparker_: btw regarding my last phonegap email ... I was reminded of that because I started out saying that there were a few things you need to know ... and I only enumerated one in the first email. :-)
[15:24:31] <toddmparker_> that was a long one
[15:25:14] <kinblas> which? the phonegap email?
[15:25:31] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:27:56] <kinblas> toddmparker_: regarding the "preventing flashing" email ... that is why you see this checkerboard update on screen sometimes
[15:28:05] <kinblas> that checkerboard is about 512x512
[15:30:49] <johnbender> kinblas: the thing that bums me out about that
[15:31:20] <kinblas> uh huh
[15:31:20] <johnbender> is, even on the best platform we run on now, there are still significant issues with rendering/performance
[15:31:29] <kinblas> yeah
[15:31:52] <johnbender> it's the kind of thing that makes me want to throttle people who run around proclaiming html5 as Jesus come again for build mobile applications
[15:32:03] <johnbender> a measured evaluation of tools is required
[15:32:20] <toddmparker_> kinblas and johnbender - i kinda want to look at this more
[15:32:22] <toddmparker_> .ui-listview li { -webkit-transform: rotateY(0); }
[15:32:42] <johnbender> then the poor saps on the other end of the rhetoric come to us complaining abou the transitions
[15:32:43] <toddmparker_> this rule or something similar really fixes all the scrolling issues
[15:33:07] <kinblas> toddmparker_: It has to be used with caution, perhaps a doc page about it, with sample, and big WARNING
[15:33:12] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:33:23] <toddmparker_> here's my idea: we add this rule to the docs CSS
[15:33:44] <kinblas> toddmparker_: If you want to see the bad ... try loading jQTouch's first page of their demo with 400 items in it
[15:33:49] <kinblas> it flickers like a mo-fo
[15:34:00] <kinblas> but they are using the trick
[15:34:11] <toddmparker_> we also add a big yellow block saying I'f you keep your pages reasonable, you can add in this hack .ui-listview li { -webkit-transform: rotateY(0); } to make scrolling faster. We do this in the docs. Here are the warnings...
[15:34:20] <toddmparker_> ours doesn't
[15:34:28] <toddmparker_> that 400 item list is like butter
[15:34:30] <toddmparker_> not stutters
[15:34:32] <kinblas> scrolling isn't faster
[15:34:37] <kinblas> rendering is
[15:34:39] <toddmparker_> yeah it is
[15:34:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: on which platform
[15:34:43] <kinblas> it still scrolls the same
[15:34:49] <toddmparker_> drop that rule in and compare to /test/
[15:34:58] <toddmparker_> iphone 4 / ios5
[15:34:59] <kinblas> johnbender: heh good point, that trick only works on iOS
[15:35:07] <toddmparker_> android too?
[15:35:12] <toddmparker_> -webkit
[15:35:19] <toddmparker_> bb, webos?
[15:35:20] <kinblas> what platforms are accelerated?
[15:35:30] <toddmparker_> well, that's a different story
[15:35:32] <kinblas> Zoom ... it still blinks like crazy
[15:35:38] <toddmparker_> the prefix woudl hit 'em all
[15:35:43] <johnbender> I heard from a friend that Honeycomb was hardware accel is that right?
[15:35:43] <toddmparker_> with that in?
[15:35:52] <toddmparker_> honeycomb is such crap
[15:35:55] <kinblas> toddmparker_: you really need to look at the jQTouch example
[15:36:01] <kinblas> for how bad it can get
[15:36:13] <toddmparker_> anyway, in ios this makes a huge difference
[15:36:32] <kinblas> jQTouch + 400 items + iPad (in Portrait)
[15:36:43] <toddmparker_> with your tweaks and this single rule, scrolling is smooth
[15:37:02] <kinblas> I don't think it should be our default
[15:37:03] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: so that transform creates a texture bitmap then and that's why it scrolls nicely in some cases but can get blinky?
[15:37:37] <toddmparker_> have you seen that?
[15:37:39] <kinblas> johnbender: the bitmap gets cached if it's smaller than 1024x1024
[15:37:57] <kinblas> so when the exposed areas are shown, it just blits the cached bitmaps
[15:38:03] <kinblas> so no tiny checkerboards
[15:38:22] <kinblas> johnbender: but the problem is the bitmaps are cached
[15:38:43] <toddmparker_> and no freezing at the ends of the cached screen
[15:38:48] <kinblas> and not released unless the rule is removed, the item is display:none, or ripped out of the DOM
[15:39:20] <johnbender> kinblas: hrm so that creates a stale display
[15:39:25] <toddmparker_> yeha
[15:39:33] <toddmparker_> crashed my ipad too
[15:39:39] <johnbender> kinblas: reflow doesn't clean out the cache?
[15:39:47] <kinblas> johnbender: well it does get upated when things are re-layedout or colors are changed
[15:39:54] <johnbender> ah
[15:39:56] <kinblas> it just renders it into that bitmap it's holding it on to
[15:40:08] <kinblas> but for scrolling, yeah you only see the cached bitmap until things stop
[15:40:08] <toddmparker_> tho damn that's fast and smooth
[15:40:21] <toddmparker_> you try this yet?
[15:40:29] <kinblas> heh toddmparker_ you're hypnotized/drawn-in
[15:40:36] <toddmparker_> like crack
[15:40:50] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah I used it last year for Citrus - MAX 2010
[15:40:58] <kinblas> which never made it's debut on stage
[15:41:07] <kinblas> :-/
[15:41:09] <toddmparker_> i know used this a lot on his flip pics app too
[15:41:10] <johnbender> kinblas: so the danger is that with larger content it will create smaller tyles and there's a risk of the checkerboard when the viewport reaches where a new tile needs to be rendered?
[15:41:21] <toddmparker_> i've been afraid of it, but this is kinda huge
[15:41:27] <kinblas> johnbender: ya mon
[15:41:32] <johnbender> alright
[15:41:44] * johnbender feels better about his understanding of rendering issues in ios
[15:42:00] <kinblas> :-D
[15:42:12] <toddmparker_> oddly, our ipad running ios 4 is smooth even on test
[15:42:38] <toddmparker_> is it just ios 5 on an iphone that is so crappy on this page?
[15:43:51] <toddmparker_> well, worth giving this a bit of thought and testing as a potential tweak for 1.0, even if it's just something we document
[15:44:10] <toddmparker_> kinblas: things feel so snappy now
[15:44:14] <toddmparker_> incredible work
[15:44:27] * kinblas holds his breath
[15:44:36] <kinblas> things are still slow :-P
[15:45:19] <toddmparker_> yeah, keep stealing those ms
[15:45:30] <kinblas> yeah I'm looking at checkboxradio
[15:45:32] <kinblas> the next big one
[15:45:38] <toddmparker_> cool
[15:45:52] <toddmparker_> hey kin - the wiki page on adding custom transitions
[15:46:01] <toddmparker_> should i add that to the docs? seems like good info
[15:46:03] <kinblas> if you guys see folks complaining about speed, ask them for their sample, I want to check this stuff on real-world stuff
[15:46:13] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:46:14] <kinblas> toddmparker_: perhaps a call on @jquerymobile?
[15:46:22] <toddmparker_> sure
[15:46:24] <kinblas> hmmm, that may be overwhelming?
[15:47:32] <toddmparker_> tweeted
[15:47:34] <toddmparker_> nah
[15:48:09] <toddmparker_> kinblas: i forget the author's name
[15:48:20] <toddmparker_> i'll try to track him down but he seemed solid
[15:48:34] <toddmparker_> ok, heading home
[15:48:35] <kinblas> toddmparker_: heh, I only asked because I've worked with some authors inthe past
[15:48:44] <toddmparker_> i'll be on tonight working on docs and such
[15:48:45] <kinblas> who really lean on their technical editors to clean up their writing
[15:48:48] <kinblas> was a lot of work
[15:48:51] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:48:55] <toddmparker_> that is the danger here
[15:49:00] <kinblas> "you write books? really?"
[15:49:55] <toddmparker_> i don't. i'm done.
[15:50:32] <toddmparker_> later fellas
[15:51:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: when you get a chance https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2948
[15:51:41] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (5d, 2h ago): Fix for #2947: ui-btn-hover is not removed when mouse down
[15:51:49] <johnbender> seems like asthetics to me
[15:52:03] <johnbender> *aesthetics
[16:08:17] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1102
[16:08:33] <johnbender> I'm thinking it might be faster to just blur all the inputs
[16:08:49] <johnbender> depending on how the psuedo selector works
[16:08:59] <johnbender> this is more a question/excercise than anything
[16:09:10] <johnbender> I don't think it will make much of a difference
[16:09:14] <kinblas> typically folks let the CSS rules dictate what gets shown
[16:09:28] <kinblas> the hover does get removed properly though in all cases right?
[16:09:48] <johnbender> kinblas: are you talking about the pull request?
[16:10:05] <johnbender> or the link to the nav code
[16:10:16] <kinblas> oh, I thought you were talking about something else
[16:10:36] <kinblas> johnbender: the problem with my comment is that I don't think focus/blur events bubble up
[16:10:52] <kinblas> so watching for them won't work
[16:11:12] <johnbender> I'm still confused
[16:11:17] <kinblas> nevermind
[16:11:37] <johnbender> :(
[16:11:38] <kinblas> you're asking if finding the focused input is slower than just enumerating all inputs and calling blur on them?
[16:11:49] <johnbender> yes!
[16:12:06] <kinblas> depends on the number of inputs ;-)
[16:12:13] <johnbender> thats what I figured
[16:12:18] <kinblas> extra function overhead, extra event handler triggers
[16:12:20] <kinblas> blah blah
[16:12:35] <kinblas> of course one difference
[16:12:42] <kinblas> is that :focus is a fake pseudo
[16:12:48] <johnbender> yes
[16:12:51] <johnbender> which means parsing
[16:12:54] <johnbender> and probably looping
[16:12:56] <kinblas> yeah
[16:13:11] <kinblas> worth a jsperf?
[16:13:12] <kinblas> :-)
[16:13:19] <johnbender> hah
[16:13:35] <johnbender> haven't dont that befoe
[16:13:38] <johnbender> why not now?!
[16:13:45] <kinblas> it's easy, even I figured it out
[16:13:49] <johnbender> though I have a bad feeling I'm going to bork the results somehow
[16:13:55] <johnbender> perf/statistics are easy to screw up
[16:14:00] <johnbender> kinblas: pfft
[16:14:02] <kinblas> johnbender: just uncheck the make public while you dork with it
[16:14:10] <johnbender> good advice
[16:16:58] <kinblas> johnbender: one thing that may be a perf hit is if those elements have blur handlers, you may trigger them all?

[16:22:13] <jqm-jenkins-bot> gabriele.rabbiosi: Corrected some tests for the slider widget
[16:24:17] <johnbender> kinblas: doesn't matter the :focus is _way_ faster even for small sets of inputs
[16:24:40] <kinblas> ok, good to know
[16:24:48] <kinblas> you have a jsperf url?
[16:24:49] <johnbender> checked on desktop and wp 7
[16:24:54] <kinblas> oh ok
[16:24:56] <johnbender> kinblas: jsperf.com/input-focus-blur-vs-input-blur
[16:25:10] <johnbender> kinblas: check to make sure I'm not doing it wrong
[16:25:44] <kinblas> heh .. that's pretty clear
[16:26:02] <kinblas> perhaps in setup you should give one of them focus?
[16:26:13] <kinblas> maybe it doesn't matter
[16:26:54] <kinblas> heh 95% slower
[16:30:15] <johnbender> kinblas: yah that slowed it down but not by much
[16:30:26] <johnbender> I'm guessing blur is a slow operation then
[16:31:51] <johnbender> made a big dent in the ie results but narrowing the results is way faster
[16:32:11] <johnbender> I guess that makes sense given that blur has implications for the browser input rendering
[16:32:27] <johnbender> and a whole host of other things
[16:39:25] <kinblas> yeah
[16:39:46] * kinblas shaves another 150ms off form gallery
[16:51:32] <johnbender> kinblas: shweet
[16:51:52] <kinblas> ok I'm headin' out, I should be on late tonight
