[02:56:02] <Flori1> hi guys. you usually posted your weekly team agenads here: https://jquery.org/updates/ but the site isn't updated anymore (and it's css seem broken). is there a new url, where I can read your team meeting summarys? regards. flori
[03:25:14] <uGoMobi> Flori1: I don't know what happened with the updates
[03:25:38] <uGoMobi> Flori1: you can read the #jquery-meeting log here http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/
[03:25:55] <uGoMobi> Flori1: but we used to post the agenda as well
[03:26:15] <uGoMobi> Flori1: note that there wasn't a jQuery Mobile meeting last week
[03:27:21] <uGoMobi> (last meeting was May 9)
[03:30:28] <Flori1> thank you :-)
[03:30:45] <uGoMobi> rworth: do you know what happened to jquery.org/updates/ ?
[03:31:23] <Flori1> maybe, the site wasn't updated due to your global jquery site relaunch?
[03:32:29] <uGoMobi> the new site has been launched before March
[03:32:58] <uGoMobi> and I saw last updates on that broken page were from March

[05:27:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the meeting notes thing i remember toddmparker asking for help porting them to someplace else durring the last meeting
[05:27:47] <arschmitz> so there is something going on with those but i dont know details i think agcolom was helping too though
[05:28:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah, you're right

[05:45:14] <arschmitz> wow at least some of the api docs examples are using JQM 1.1.1
[05:55:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping!
[05:56:32] <uGoMobi> I can't figure out where the popup widget grabs the theme from the page if no theme has been set
[06:45:14] <gseguin> Good morning
[06:53:12] <arschmitz> gseguin: good morning
[07:40:29] <toddmparker> morning
[07:40:53] <arschmitz> toddmparker: morning
[07:45:44] <gseguin> hey toddmparker
[07:49:42] <toddmparker> how was your weekends arschmitz and gseguin 
[07:50:02] <toddmparker> man, we're looking at a rainy week here in boston
[07:50:10] <toddmparker> good to grow some grass i suppose
[07:50:30] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah sadly we get the same weather as you just about 6 hours after lol
[07:50:33] <arschmitz> and colder
[07:52:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker so iv been looking at hand.js and the interactions stuff from ui
[07:52:47] <arschmitz> and i have bad news
[07:57:10] <gseguin> weekend was good
[07:57:24] <gseguin> had a fun friday afternoon with the office
[07:57:49] <gseguin> 20 mile bike ride and 5 breweries along the way
[07:58:31] <gseguin> one more week to JSConf! I'm excited!
[07:59:29] <toddmparker> arschmitz: bad news?
[07:59:39] <toddmparker> gseguin: that sounds awesome
[07:59:45] <toddmparker> and potentially very bad for you
[07:59:55] <toddmparker> drinking + exercise? only in colorado.
[08:00:02] <gseguin> heh :)
[08:00:38] <gseguin> arschmitz: what bad news?
[08:01:16] <arschmitz> well we were hoping to just pull in whatever ui decided
[08:01:33] <arschmitz> to replace vmouse basicly instead of updating it to work with pointer events
[08:01:43] <toddmparker> right..and?
[08:01:54] <arschmitz> none of those do anythign to handle click or tap
[08:02:11] <arschmitz> so it would do nothing to replace vclick which is where most of our issues are
[08:02:49] <arschmitz> they only map the mouse pointer and touch events 1 for 1 so mousedown = pointerdown = touchstart that sort of thing
[08:03:55] <arschmitz> thats the easy part of what vmouse does vclick is the hard part
[08:05:02] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: you around?
[08:06:10] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: yup
[08:06:39] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so iv been looking at hand.js and the interactions stuff like we talked about
[08:06:53] <toddmparker> I see
[08:06:59] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: FYI: MS decided we shouldn't use hand.js for jQuery.
[08:07:01] <arschmitz> but sadly none of these attempt to address the issues that we had
[08:07:11] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok cool
[08:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have a list of issues?
[08:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-pointer-events
[08:07:35] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: do you know why MS said that?
[08:07:44] <toddmparker> just curious about the conversation
[08:07:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: cool had not seen that yet
[08:08:12] <arschmitz> i can make a list but basicly it comes down to one event
[08:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> Because they would need to duplicate a fair amount of jQuery's event system to get the same benefits.
[08:08:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: we have an event vClick
[08:09:04] <arschmitz> that attempts to normalize inital touch and click to work around the 300ms click delay
[08:09:13] <arschmitz> to make buttons and stuff more responsive
[08:09:43] <arschmitz> none of these polyfills seem to address this and this is where most of our issues come from
[08:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> None of the polyfills should address that.
[08:10:11] <scott_gonzalez> In fact, making click act like fastclick would be a bug in any polyfill.
[08:10:28] <arschmitz> we dont make it act different we make a whole new event vClick
[08:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> Right, but obviously none of the polyfills will produce a vClick event.
[08:11:40] <arschmitz> right... all the issues we had previously discussed about different targets and heuristics all related to this so this will not really address any of the issues we were working on
[08:11:55] <arschmitz> or had ran into
[08:12:19] <arschmitz> we were hoping to replace our vmouse plugin
[08:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you should definitely replace vmouse.
[08:12:36] <arschmitz> but clearly this will not be possible 
[08:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> If you need a fastclick event, that should be the only thing left.
[08:13:01] <arschmitz> we could replace most of it but vclick will have to stay
[08:13:03] <arschmitz> right 
[08:13:28] <arschmitz> i guess this was never made clear before
[08:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> Does vClick try to let the native click event happen for smart devices?
[08:14:06] <arschmitz> vclick tries to take the first event that happens and uses that
[08:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> That's not really good.
[08:14:21] <kinblas1> scott_gonzalez: it lets the native click go through unless you prevent default
[08:14:28] <arschmitz> yup
[08:14:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok
[08:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> So a native click that has no delay will be used?
[08:14:45] <kinblas> arschmitz: why not implement the vclick functionality on top of the pointer stuff
[08:14:53] <arschmitz> kinblas: we could
[08:15:16] <kinblas> arschmitz: that is rip out the mouse and touch events from vmouse and replace it with the pointer special events
[08:15:44] <kinblas> scott_gonzalez: is there reference to the original (real) event in the pointer stuff?
[08:15:45] <arschmitz> kinblas: thats what scott_gonzalez and i were just talking about
[08:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> Apple should just implement native fastclick.
[08:15:54] <toddmparker> That seems like the way to go. Use one of these more standard polyfills, then add a fast click feature on top
[08:15:57] <kinblas> we'll still need that to kill the click if prevent default is called
[08:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> Why do they have to make touch so crappy?
[08:16:22] <arschmitz> yeah what we really need is a better fastclick
[08:16:24] <toddmparker> apparently, newer android will do a native fast click if you disable pinch zoom
[08:16:35] <kinblas> scott_gonzalez: because they had to keep compatibility with mouse events/web
[08:16:38] <toddmparker> not a great tradeoff imho, but they are thinking about it anyway
[08:16:43] <scott_gonzalez> kinblas: Tha'ts not why.
[08:16:57] <kinblas> scott_gonzalez: you're talking about the 300ms right?
[08:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:17:12] <kinblas> brb
[08:17:14] <toddmparker> less a bout being crappy and more about needing time to disambiguate between gestures
[08:17:21] <scott_gonzalez> If other vendors can avoid it based on things like viewport scaling, then there's no compat issue.
[08:18:31] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah the reason why it only works with viewport scaling disabled is because they dont need to worry about tracking multi touch at that point
[08:21:02] <arschmitz> im wondering if there is a better implementation of fastclick then what we have now 
[08:21:16] <arschmitz> there are a ton of implementations out there
[08:24:59] <kinblas> scott_gonzalez: from what I've seen they all pretty much do the same thing â€¦ the hard part comes into play when folks trigger content changes that affect what was underneath the point of touch
[08:25:28] <kinblas> when the browser fires the synthesized events they just target the click to whatever is at or around that point, at that moment
[08:25:38] <arschmitz> kinblas: yeah i was just looking at a few implementations on github and when i look at open issues they have all the same ones we do if not more
[08:26:01] <kinblas> *ALSO* in other browsers (Android 2.0) we had issuse because the browser wasn't consistent about the targets the chose for touch and the synthesized mouse events
[08:26:41] <kinblas> you could tap on a link and the touch event would be targeted towards that, but then the mouse events would be targeted to another element above it when they were fired, or even to some random element 100px away
[08:26:58] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick is what Google is promoting.
[08:27:25] <arschmitz> kinblas: scott_gonzalez: yeah i just looked at that one
[08:27:30] <kinblas> scott_gonzalez: yeah vmouse does essentially the same thing â€¦ the extra thing it did was try to normalize the other mouse events
[08:27:33] <arschmitz> they have all the same problems 
[08:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> At least that's the one that Rick Byers mentioned in his I/O talk.
[08:27:36] <kinblas> which is what jquery-pointer is doing now
[08:28:00] <kinblas> scott_gonzalez: arschmitz: right, they all have the same problems â€¦ its like the dirty secret no one talks about
[08:28:23] <kinblas> the problem is made more apparent when we animate things on touchend (the fast click)
[08:28:43] <kinblas> back-in-the-day todd and I decided not to use vclick if it triggered an animation
[08:28:48] <arschmitz> seems like we should probably just stick with what we have for vClick and go with a poly fill for the rest 
[08:28:52] <kinblas> to avoid the problem â€¦ or to just do things on click
[08:50:43] <toddmparker> hey kinblas 
[08:57:53] <kinblas> toddmparker: yo
[09:27:13] <toddmparker> thanks for hopping in on this
[09:39:20] <kinblas> toddmparker: no problemo
[09:41:38] <arschmitz> kinblas: if you dont mind i might have to pick your brain at some point because we will probably haveto add pointerdown to vclick
[09:42:04] <kinblas> arschmitz: sure
[09:42:33] <arschmitz> kinblas: cool it ont be right off i have some other stuff to get to first but probably something we need to do before 1.4
[09:43:03] <arschmitz> kinblas: and thank you
[09:43:30] <kinblas> arschmitz: always willing to help when I can â€¦ just ping me
[09:43:43] <arschmitz> kinblas: awesome really appreciate it

[12:46:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pong!
[12:46:19] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[12:46:28] <_|Nix|_> What's up?
[12:47:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I couldn't find out how the popup gets the page theme if no theme has been set
[12:49:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lemme check ...
[12:50:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: From _create():
[12:50:15] <_|Nix|_> 		if ( !this.options.theme ) {
[12:50:15] <_|Nix|_> 			this._setOptions( { theme: this._page.jqmData( "theme" ) || $.mobile.getInheritedTheme( this._page, "c" ) } );
[12:50:18] <_|Nix|_> 		}
[12:51:44] <_|Nix|_> I should probably replace that with $.mobile.getAttribute there ...
[12:52:30] <_|Nix|_> Although that whole thing will probably be gone.
[12:52:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Popup is an interesting animal: Upon _create, it gets moved after data-role='footer'.
[12:52:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm, I think there is a problem with my local file
[12:54:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was looking in next where I removed that code but still popup is getting ui-body-x class
[12:55:00] <uGoMobi> pffff
[12:55:09] <uGoMobi> reload does miracles
[12:55:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: popup is child of ui-page
[12:57:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so I can make it inherit with CSS
[12:58:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Great!
[12:59:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've also noticed that sometimes a reload causes the whole document to explode, and the next reload fixes it. O_o
[12:59:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in branch "next"?
[12:59:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, anywhere.
[12:59:43] <_|Nix|_> I blame Chrome.
[13:00:05] <uGoMobi> yikes
[13:00:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You're really smokin' on "next"! Good work!
[13:00:27] <uGoMobi> thanks
[13:00:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You might put hapless JS code monkeys like myself out of a job with your CSS-fu :)
[13:01:23] <uGoMobi> haha
[13:07:58] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Good evening Jasper! Can I ask about something that I think is an old issue?
[13:08:09] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi - how goes?
[13:08:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne, sure
[13:08:18] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker !
[13:08:24] <toddmparker> been a while!
[13:08:28] <agcolom> Is it me or are icons not quite centered?
[13:08:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it's not you
[13:08:44] <agcolom> not sure whether it's my eyes ;-)
[13:09:05] <agcolom> that's an old issue I think right?
[13:09:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we add some negative margin to fill a gap
[13:09:10] <agcolom> Good evening toddmparker !
[13:09:28] <agcolom> oh ok!
[13:09:31] <uGoMobi> that gap is because 3 x 33.3% isn't 100%
[13:09:53] <agcolom> right...
[13:09:57] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I'll try to improve that for 1.4
[13:10:21] <agcolom> cool! Can we use like a long decimal point?
[13:10:22] <uGoMobi> because it was mostly a problem on IE7 and BB5 which both will become C-grade
[13:10:29] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: how was your vacation?
[13:11:10] <toddmparker> was nice and relaxing
[13:11:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you mean 33.333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333% ?
[13:11:15] <toddmparker> got a good sunburn
[13:11:15] <agcolom> toddmparker: yes, did you go somewhere nice? (The weather is rubbish in the UK And France.... it's like november already@ 
[13:11:21] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes ;-)
[13:11:22] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: great
[13:11:28] <toddmparker> florida, the nice part :)
[13:12:04] <agcolom> OMG I am sooooooo jealous! sunburn is a good sign by my standard this year! 
[13:12:07] <uGoMobi> agcolom: IE7 rounds down to whole pixels so there will always be a gap
[13:12:10] <toddmparker> heh
[13:12:13] <agcolom> it means you have seen the sun!!!!
[13:12:54] <agcolom> uGoMobi: that is terrible! Shame on IE7 !
[13:13:15] <uGoMobi> well, if they would round up the last element would wrap to next line
[13:13:38] <agcolom> ok, so that would be event worse...
[13:13:47] <uGoMobi> somehow modern browsers deal better with this problem
[13:13:49] <agcolom> even ^ 
[13:14:08] <toddmparker> so what good times did i miss?
[13:14:18] <agcolom> toddmparker: we now have an icon page! 
[13:14:25] <uGoMobi> and CSS calc() is gaining browser support so I guess we can use 1/3 sometime
[13:14:27] <agcolom> http://api.jquerymobile.com/icons/
[13:14:34] <uGoMobi> heh
[13:16:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/test/theming/ there you can see some progress
[13:17:08] <uGoMobi> none of the widgets there have a data-theme, it's just the page that has theme B (light)
[13:17:27] <uGoMobi> everything inherits
[13:17:46] <agcolom> uGoMobi: nice! is it normal that the usually round items (i.e. handles) are squareish?
[13:18:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you can set the radius
[13:18:41] <agcolom> oh and that gets inherited as well?
[13:18:42] <uGoMobi> so we can still decide to use same radius as before
[13:18:59] <uGoMobi> to some extend, yes
[13:19:25] <agcolom> ok and the orange is because you're from the netherlands right?
[13:20:02] <uGoMobi> but in theme CSS (or with theme roller) you can still set the radius like before, I just did something different for a change :)
[13:20:05] <uGoMobi> haha
[13:20:17] <uGoMobi> actually it was bright pink before
[13:20:27] <uGoMobi> probably same as your Twingo
[13:20:34] <agcolom> that might have been good for me ;-)
[13:20:39] <uGoMobi> but I didn't want to scare everyone
[13:20:51] <agcolom> my twingo will be 18 in about 2 weeks!
[13:20:54] <uGoMobi> it's just temporary
[13:21:13] <uGoMobi> needed something else than blue which I use in the A swatch (dark)
[13:21:20] <uGoMobi> wow
[13:21:30] <uGoMobi> and still going strong?
[13:21:45] <agcolom> it's perfect! I only use it for short distances.... 
[13:22:12] <uGoMobi> this is A swatch http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/test/forms-a/form-fieldcontain.php
[13:22:15] <agcolom> I even forgot to lock the doors a few years ago while going on holiday for 2 or 3 weeks! I came back and it was still intact!
[13:22:36] <uGoMobi> seriously
[13:22:44] <uGoMobi> are you sure you live in London? ;)
[13:23:09] <agcolom> yes ;-) 
[13:23:27] <agcolom> noone wants an old left hand drive twingo ;-) 
[13:23:43] <agcolom> I like theme a! A lot!
[13:24:02] <agcolom> just one thing... not really sure it's an issue...
[13:24:12] <agcolom> let me check again
[13:24:23] <uGoMobi> oh there are still a lot of issues :)
[13:25:27] <uGoMobi> but please tell... I take notes
[13:25:41] <agcolom> ok, here it is.
[13:25:54] <agcolom> not a big deal but worth discussing. 
[13:26:40] <agcolom> The handle on the slider and the switch get a "halo" colored shadow when the user clicks on it.
[13:27:10] <uGoMobi> yes, focus style
[13:27:14] <agcolom> however, it you change the value without touching the handle, we don't get this effect
[13:27:34] <agcolom> yes, I'm not sure whether we should have it or not have it...
[13:28:23] <uGoMobi> but if you click on the track or the flip toggle label there is no focus on the handle
[13:28:32] <uGoMobi> I understand what you mean though
[13:28:35] <agcolom> what feels strange is that it's not all the time. if you miss the handle, you get what you want but not the focus effect
[13:29:12] <uGoMobi> I think it's already like that on master
[13:29:44] <uGoMobi> thing is we want to do as much as possible with CSS instead of JS when it comes to styles
[13:29:46] <agcolom> I'd be incline not to have the focus effect... but we need to discuss this I think... maybe if toddmparker has time to think about this also
[13:29:57] <agcolom> uGoMobi: oh absolutely
[13:30:03] <uGoMobi> now I just use :focus
[13:30:28] <uGoMobi> if we want to add focus style when you click on the track we have to do .addClass("ui-focus")
[13:31:12] <uGoMobi> it's same when you type in the slider number input
[13:31:29] <uGoMobi> then the input has focus but the handle is moving
[13:32:35] <agcolom> because right now we can add the focus on the switch, then change the slider value by just touching somewhere, say on the right of the handle, and because we don't touch the slider handle, the focus remains on the switch 
[13:33:04] <uGoMobi> yes that's true
[13:33:33] <agcolom> so I think if we use focus, it should go to what is moving
[13:33:49] <uGoMobi> maybe blur() when you click on the track
[13:33:58] <agcolom> if we don't use focus, does that improve perf?
[13:34:55] <uGoMobi> using :focus doesn't really matter
[13:35:09] <uGoMobi> but faux focus with JS does
[13:35:23] <agcolom> ok, and how about turning a focused element to blur?
[13:35:30] <agcolom> I guess the same?
[13:36:14] <uGoMobi> well I don't think that blur() is big performance hit
[13:36:25] <uGoMobi> I just don't think it's good for accessibility
[13:36:31] <uGoMobi> when you use keyboard
[13:36:53] <uGoMobi> you won't see where you are because we disable the outline
[13:36:54] <agcolom> yes, accessibility is important 
[13:38:11] <agcolom> so maybe add focus when we touch the track?
[13:38:27] <uGoMobi> yeah that's possible
[13:38:44] <agcolom> I think that'd be a good addition then
[13:39:14] <agcolom> adding focus would mean we blur whatever was in focus previously?
[13:40:32] <uGoMobi> yes if we add it to the track we have to blur the input and handle
[13:41:19] <agcolom> what do you think?
[13:41:44] <uGoMobi> to be honest I don't really see the need
[13:41:52] <uGoMobi> but have to test a bit more
[13:43:59] <agcolom> ok. I have no strong opinion, but I want to ensure it get discussed. I'm not too worried about the focus on the handle when we input a value via the kbd, but I think touching the track should at least give whatever was in focus before the blur status
[13:46:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: when you now click on the track the handle still has focus meaning that you can still use arrow keys to adjust the value
[13:46:59] <uGoMobi> that can be convenient if you have a range of 1000 or something
[13:47:17] <agcolom> that's what I was going to say as well
[13:47:28] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:47:47] <agcolom> actually It's good to have the focus on the input
[13:47:51] <agcolom> field
[13:47:52] <agcolom> !
[13:48:43] <uGoMobi> don't need to have focus on the number input, as long as the handle has focus you can use the arrow keys to set the value
[13:49:05] <agcolom> ok, how about never have the focus on the handle? Is that a pb to change the switch value?
[13:49:44] <agcolom> I can't seem to access the switch via the keyboard?
[13:49:54] <uGoMobi> not?
[13:49:58] <agcolom> (and buttons too)
[13:50:14] <uGoMobi> I can flip the switch with arrow keys
[13:50:26] <agcolom> ok, let me try...
[13:50:48] <uGoMobi> for accessibility it must be possible to set focus on the handle
[13:51:13] <agcolom> I can't set focus to the switch from the kbd (Safari)
[13:51:25] <agcolom> I'll try FF
[13:51:39] <uGoMobi> hmm that's an issue
[13:52:52] <agcolom> FF also skips the switch
[13:53:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: can you get focus on the handle with the tab key on Safari?
[13:53:06] <agcolom> and some of the buttons in the controlgroup
[13:53:19] <agcolom> no
[13:54:02] <uGoMobi> I see that too :(
[13:54:19] <agcolom> Also can't set focus on the 1st two items in the Horizontal controlgroup, mixed 
[13:54:22] <uGoMobi> I don't see an issue on FF thought
[13:54:24] <uGoMobi> though*
[13:55:08] <agcolom> in FF, I can set focus on the second and third items in the Horizontal controlgroup, mixed
[13:55:19] <agcolom> but not the handles 
[13:57:25] <agcolom> also can't set focus on the third item in Horizontal controlgroup, buttons:
[13:57:30] <agcolom> (with FF)
[13:58:14] <uGoMobi> hmm
[13:58:32] <uGoMobi> I do see all the Safari issues but on FF all works fine for me
[13:58:38] <uGoMobi> have to test on OS X
[13:59:54] <uGoMobi> will look into that this week
[14:00:00] <agcolom> yes, I'm on OS X... but I'm on a fairly old version of OSX so maybe on a more recent version the result would be different...
[14:00:01] <uGoMobi> thanks for testing!
[14:00:16] <agcolom> no pb :-) I love testing these things ;-)
[14:00:18] <uGoMobi> what is the FF version?
[14:00:51] <agcolom> 20.0 hold on.... it's just decided to download an update!
[14:01:07] <uGoMobi> same here
[14:01:35] <agcolom> my network is quite slow today... 
[14:01:55] <uGoMobi> I am 21.0 now
[14:02:08] <agcolom> nearly there....
[14:03:28] <agcolom> applying update...... yawn! 
[14:03:33] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:03:47] <uGoMobi> does it serve coffee with the update?
[14:04:10] <agcolom> I hope so ;-)
[14:04:18] <agcolom> restarting.... 
[14:06:30] <agcolom> same thig
[14:06:33] <agcolom> thing ^
[14:07:44] <agcolom> skipping a few things.... Custom multiple select: is skipped
[14:08:04] <agcolom> Vertical controlgroup, buttons: item 3 is skipped
[14:08:23] <agcolom> Horizontal controlgroup, buttons: item 3 is skipped
[14:08:31] <uGoMobi> sounds like the buttons that are wrapped in a div are skipped
[14:08:47] <agcolom> Horizontal controlgroup, mixed: item 1 is skipped
[14:08:50] <uGoMobi> that's probably a select too (the 3rd in the hor. group)
[14:09:29] <agcolom> (the first item, not the one that is in 3rd position and says one ;-) )
[14:09:40] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:09:44] <uGoMobi> clear
[14:10:54] <agcolom> yes, that was funny when I realised item 3 was actually saying 'one'!!!!! 
[14:11:28] <agcolom> and the switch is skipped too
[14:11:46] <agcolom> the sliders gets focus on the input field
[14:12:51] <uGoMobi> sometimes you wish there was just one browser :)
[14:12:57] <uGoMobi> everyone on Netscape
[14:13:12] <agcolom> ok, I'll have to leave it at this for today :-) but happy to try again tomorrow. I'll try on my other laptop too tomorrow (more recent OS)
[14:13:24] <agcolom> good old days ;-)
[14:13:27] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[14:13:33] <uGoMobi> good night
[14:13:40] <agcolom> Goodnight!
[14:13:44] <agcolom> thanks!

[15:26:34] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: sorry, my internet died and i was dealing with the cable company
[15:26:40] <toddmparker> those theming pages look awesome
[15:26:55] <uGoMobi> welcome back online :)
[15:26:59] <uGoMobi> thanks
[15:27:05] <toddmparker> I like the new styles you have in this default theme
[15:27:10] <toddmparker> feels a lot more modern
[15:27:45] <uGoMobi> light swatch is always difficult
[15:28:02] <uGoMobi> don't want it too gray but still need contrast
[15:28:36] <toddmparker> yeah, it's tricky
[15:29:15] <toddmparker> one thing we should clean up is why some things have shadows and others don't
[15:29:26] <uGoMobi> yes true
[15:29:31] <toddmparker> groups don't
[15:29:33] <uGoMobi> going to make that consistent
[15:29:37] <toddmparker> cool
[15:29:47] <toddmparker> guess they should have it?
[15:30:05] <toddmparker> so them able active per swatch, nice
[15:30:49] <toddmparker> for inset stuff like the slider track or the flip switch, we could have a class that adds inner shadow to give it some dimension
[15:30:56] <uGoMobi> icon shadow is another thing we have to look at
[15:31:01] <toddmparker> issue there is it will kill any outer shadow
[15:31:12] <toddmparker> what's that?
[15:31:42] <toddmparker> did our flip switch lose some horizontal padding? seems a wee bit tight
[15:31:45] <uGoMobi> you can't disable the icon shadow for buttons we add
[15:31:53] <uGoMobi> like split buttons and clear buttons etc
[15:32:22] <toddmparker> can you now?
[15:32:24] <uGoMobi> maybe the mini sized one
[15:32:33] <uGoMobi> no
[15:32:48] <toddmparker> so it's not a loss of functionality
[15:32:49] <uGoMobi> and those buttons also have shadow
[15:32:55] <toddmparker> that just the shadow on the disc?
[15:33:02] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:33:04] <toddmparker> ah
[15:33:14] <uGoMobi> just looking at making it easy to have a consistent style
[15:33:20] <toddmparker> we can probably drop that if it's a hassle
[15:33:37] <toddmparker> the disc should probably switch to being a circle graphic if we can
[15:33:49] <uGoMobi> yeah and it's very easy to add globably in theme css
[15:34:03] <toddmparker> well, i found the discs were the slowest thing in a listview
[15:34:12] <toddmparker> might be the combo of border radius + shadow
[15:34:14] <uGoMobi> border instead of background you mean/
[15:34:18] <toddmparker>  1 + 1 = 5 sometimes
[15:34:26] <uGoMobi> right
[15:34:46] <uGoMobi> rgba maybe
[15:34:48] <toddmparker> i think we can drop the shadow in general, seems expensive
[15:35:05] <uGoMobi> I would be in favor
[15:35:09] <toddmparker> for the disc circle, a svg graphic may be better perf-wise
[15:35:16] <uGoMobi> not sure if we have to deprecate first
[15:35:21] <uGoMobi> because it is an option
[15:35:29] <toddmparker> yeah, maybe
[15:35:58] <toddmparker> worth testing to see if just dropping the shadow improves list views a lot
[15:36:03] <uGoMobi> ah you mean using an image for the bg
[15:36:11] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[15:36:20] <toddmparker> right
[15:36:30] <toddmparker> make a circle svg
[15:36:38] <uGoMobi> maybe it had to do with the fact we were adding the span
[15:36:47] <toddmparker> true
[15:36:50] <uGoMobi> now it's just :after pseudo element
[15:38:19] <toddmparker> so you seem really close on all this theming stuff
[15:38:32] <uGoMobi> yes I am getting there
[15:38:37] <toddmparker> what big items are left?
[15:39:07] <uGoMobi> I am looking at the theme inheritance for groups (listview, controlgroup, etc)
[15:39:25] <uGoMobi> right now if you don't set a theme the buttons inherit from page
[15:39:32] <uGoMobi> without adding a class
[15:39:55] <uGoMobi> but if you set a theme for the listview all buttons get the ui-btn-x class
[15:40:23] <uGoMobi> so I am looking at something like ui-btns-theme-x .ui-btn
[15:40:56] <uGoMobi> the problem is that setting a theme for one list item should style work
[15:41:37] <uGoMobi> and everything should work outside a page so I can't use .ui-mobile or something to increase specificity to override
[15:42:00] <uGoMobi> and another thing is inheritance inside a popup
[15:42:37] <uGoMobi> then all tests have to be renewed and the demo center has to be fixed
[15:42:58] <uGoMobi> s/should style work/should still work/
[15:43:32] <uGoMobi> that's it :)
[15:44:06] <toddmparker> nice!
[15:46:26] <uGoMobi> but I am really happy with the changes
[15:46:40] <toddmparker> yeah, this is a massive improvement
[15:46:43] <uGoMobi> when you inspect the code... so much better
[15:46:44] <toddmparker> you rock
[15:47:00] <toddmparker> i need to put the kids to bed, goodnight
[15:47:16] <uGoMobi> good night!
