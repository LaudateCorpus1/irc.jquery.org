[06:05:59] <_|Nix|_> Hey! 1.0.1 does not seem to have a corresponding tag ...
[06:06:08] <_|Nix|_> Which commit is 1.0.1?
[06:46:43] <toddmparker_> hi all
[06:47:08] <toddmparker_> johnbender? ^^
[07:13:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Not really important actually. I was just hunting down a bug, but I found it: #3544
[07:14:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Basically, we need to grab jquery.ui.widget.js from jquery-ui again, or at least backport a certain fix.
[07:15:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: But it's more of a web-ui-fw issue than a jqm issue. Of course, it totally prevents properly subclassing any jqm widget, so jqm is not entirely immune either.
[07:19:27] <Wilto> What’d I miss?

[09:02:39] <Wilto> Thanks, man!
[09:27:50] <Wilto> What did I miss?

[09:33:13] <gseguin> Wilto: mobile is dead we're going back to Semaphore Flags
[09:33:32] <gseguin> jQ.mobi, Sencha and jQM are out of business
[09:34:05] <Wilto> It’s like Mad Max up in here, all of a sudden.
[09:35:01] <Wilto> Empires have risen and fallen while I was stuck on that boat. “IN A WORLD WITHOUT MOBILE LIBRARIES…”

[10:03:26] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to be working on a preso on jqm for and internal thing probably most of today and tomorrow
[10:03:30] <johnbender> :(
[10:03:37] <toddmparker_> heh
[10:03:47] <toddmparker_> i gotta do the same for the jQ UK conf
[10:03:52] <toddmparker_> plus all my client work :/
[10:04:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I have a full day trip up on wednesday to give the presentation and then on Thursday hopefully I can get back to work on those bugs
[10:04:28] <Wilto> I am back on jQM duty, me.
[10:05:01] <Wilto> If you guys need stuff tested and such, I am your man.
[10:06:59] <toddmparker_> Wilto is working on buttoning up the toolbar forms
[10:07:42] <Wilto> Yes indeed. Just wanna give them a once-over later this afternoon to make sure I didn’t leave anything busted, and then I think the mini-widgets will be good to go into master.
[10:14:59] <gseguin> johnbender: I tagged https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/43f2ef63caf4ae407a35c3757b8aff8e27ea80b1 as 1.0.1
[10:14:59] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by johnbender (1w, 3d ago): undo the copyright swap
[10:15:05] <gseguin> can you confirm?
[10:16:07] <toddmparker_> we undid the copyright change for 1.0.1?
[10:16:19] <toddmparker_> reminds me, master needs that global too
[10:19:39] <johnbender> gseguin: I thought it was tagged already?
[10:19:47] <johnbender> ugh
[10:21:14] <johnbender> gseguin: yah that's the one
[10:21:49] <johnbender> gseguin: do we need to do another quick release for work with the theme roller?
[10:27:10] <gseguin> we might want to, toddmparker_ ?
[10:27:47] <toddmparker_> quick release for themeroller?
[10:27:57] <toddmparker_> for 1.0.1
[10:28:23] <gseguin> yeah a quick 1.0.2
[11:58:22] <johnbender> gseguin: we should add that tag to the deploy at the end
[11:58:34] <johnbender> `git tag `cat version.txt``
[11:59:22] <gseguin> shouldn't tagging be manual?
[11:59:58] <johnbender> gseguin: yes, but I was thinking it would be nice to guarantee that it's tagged
[12:00:01] <johnbender> maybe a warning then
[12:00:01] <johnbender> ?
[12:00:16] <gseguin> yeah warning, +1
[12:00:31] <johnbender> gseguin: the only reason I suggest it is that we've had this happen a could times now
[12:00:34] <johnbender> cool
[12:01:19] <gseguin> good thing is tagging can be done post-release and forgetting to tag is better than tagging the wrong commit
[12:01:46] <johnbender> gseguin: you are right sir
[12:03:16] <johnbender> gseguin: alright I added it as an issue since I can't do it right now
[12:03:22] <johnbender> gseguin: thanks for spotting and adding the tag :D
[12:03:24] <gseguin> k
[12:03:32] <gseguin> no problem
[12:03:46] <gseguin> thanks to _|Nix|_ for spotting it
[12:05:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks :D
[12:05:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I lied earlier, I might get to work on some jqm stuff sooner
[12:06:10] <johnbender> the preso is actually on Thursday, had to change my flight :/
[12:06:49] <johnbender> not my fault though
[12:06:57] <johnbender> they told me the wrong date
[12:07:04] <johnbender> though that's something I would do
[12:10:04] <toddmparker_> LIAR
[12:10:14] <toddmparker_> yikes
[12:39:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I don't see Maxine's email in that basecamp post
[12:39:33] <johnbender> I might just be missing it
[12:39:53] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[12:39:59] <toddmparker_> Lemmee just forward it
[12:42:00] <toddmparker_> ok, proper email intro on it's way
[13:05:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP.
[13:06:35] <_|Nix|_> On a different note: Do you guys know how to put an unknown selector in brackets and make it part of a larger selector expression?
[13:07:26] <_|Nix|_> Like ":(" + $.some.widget.prototype.options.initSelector + "):jqmData(additional-attr='true')"
[13:07:41] <_|Nix|_> Would something like that work? That is :() ...
[13:08:12] <_|Nix|_> The only surefire way to bracket something that I'm comfortable with is :not(:not())
[13:08:31] <_|Nix|_> However, that's an abuse of the selectors, I think.
[13:34:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: why are you bracketing them? I don't think I have a solution for you I'm just curious
[13:43:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm subclassing popup, and I want the initSelector for the subclass to be :(<initSelector for popup>):jqmData(show-arrow='true')
[13:44:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Then it gets enhanced twice, which is exactly what I intend.
[13:45:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Of course, I could just copy the value of the initSelector for popup, but that's not the point. In general, it should be possible to bracket a selector like this without having to know its contents.
[13:46:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you want composable selectors
[13:46:38] <_|Nix|_> I want a grouping operator.
[13:47:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you're out of luck a quick google shows no one has done that work
[13:47:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I know.
[13:47:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: does filter work for you?
[13:48:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: No, because I want to use enhanceWithin.
[13:48:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and enhanceWithin uses options.initSelector.
[13:48:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I don't want my class to override enhanceWithin if not absolutely necessary.
[13:50:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Unfortunately I dunno enough about extending jQuery's custom selector system ...
[13:51:14] <_|Nix|_> Here's the basic problem: sel1 = ".a, .b"; sel2 = sel1 + ":first";
[13:51:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes, composable selectors :D
[13:51:38] <_|Nix|_> This will not work as expected, obviously, because :first will only restrict .b ...
[13:51:57] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... just wanted to get that obvious example off my chest ...
[21:26:18] <gseguin> toddmparker_: That chart I sent you last time was completely off, you were right
[21:26:48] <gseguin> something was wrong with the way I configured the monitor
