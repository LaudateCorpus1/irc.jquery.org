[05:01:45] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi:
[05:02:45] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:03:17] <arschmitz> have a good weekend
[05:06:23] <uGoMobi> yeah but lost bit track of weekdays vs. weekend these days
[05:06:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol yeah holidays messing everything up
[05:07:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah :)
[05:07:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: rangeslider tests look good
[05:07:39] <uGoMobi> how were your holidays so far?
[05:07:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good pretty much over i generally dont really do anything for new years 
[05:08:06] <arschmitz> but still have tomorrow off
[05:08:10] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:08:12] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:08:30] <arschmitz> spent part of the weekend in the hospital with my wife though
[05:09:02] <arschmitz> she was super sick and got really dehydrated and since shes pregnanat they made her go into the hospital for IV fluids
[05:09:04] <uGoMobi> ohw
[05:09:11] <uGoMobi> i see
[05:09:15] <uGoMobi> how is she now?
[05:10:10] <arschmitz> well she was good and had an appointment this morning but she just now texted me saying shes not feeling good and i might need to go home and take her 
[05:10:23] <uGoMobi> yeah you should
[05:10:24] <arschmitz> will know in like half an hour or so
[05:10:29] <uGoMobi> pff
[05:10:49] <arschmitz> well she just got up so shes going to take a shower and see if she feels better if not im going home
[05:11:07] <uGoMobi> sorry to hear that
[05:11:11] <uGoMobi> are you worried
[05:11:12] <uGoMobi> ?
[05:11:27] <arschmitz> no
[05:11:54] <arschmitz> and she has an appointment in 45 mins
[05:12:05] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:12:27] <arschmitz> now depending on what they say i might be later lol
[05:12:41] <uGoMobi> right
[05:12:50] <uGoMobi> welli hope it's nothing too serious
[05:12:59] <arschmitz> i dont think it is
[05:13:08] <agcolom> Hi!
[05:13:11] <arschmitz> shes always very nervous
[05:13:17] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom 
[05:13:22] <arschmitz> hi agcolom
[05:13:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: could have to do with bit stress then ?
[05:14:03] <agcolom> arschmitz: I had a bad bug when I was pregnant and got dehydrated as well (years ago!) Dehydration makes you feel really bad! 
[05:14:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its our first child so its all new lol
[05:14:19] <uGoMobi> yes of course
[05:14:25] <agcolom> I hope all will be well and you can celebrate this evening together :-)
[05:14:34] <uGoMobi> yeah me too
[05:14:39] <arschmitz> thank you both
[05:17:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i noticed this weekend sliders and panels dont work together at all lol
[05:17:07] <agcolom> arschmitz: if you need advice or anything, I'll be happy to help :-) when is baby due?
[05:17:29] <arschmitz> agcolom: thank you very much i appreciate it. He is due march 10th
[05:18:12] <agcolom> arschmitz: cool! Spring is a good time :-)
[05:18:33] <arschmitz> yeah 
[05:18:40] <arschmitz> not too hot not too cold lol
[05:19:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is the sliders and panel issue because of the swipe event to close the panel?
[05:19:23] <agcolom> yes, but also it's that time when they start to walk, and then the following year it is the same time again for potty training!
[05:19:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup exactly 
[05:20:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: hadent even thought of that lol
[05:20:41] <agcolom> guys, I've put a tutorial up for how to use the themeroller... I've reused what we already had for the 1st part, and wrote the second part from scratch... 
[05:21:12] <agcolom> http://stage.learn.jquery.com/jquery-mobile/theme-roller/
[05:21:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: i think there is code in slider.js to prevent the page to scroll... maybe we can change that so it also prevents swipe
[05:22:00] <uGoMobi> just a thought
[05:22:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think swipe to close should be an option on panel too
[05:22:59] <uGoMobi> that's also a possibility... if you use swipe for navigation you might run into problems too
[05:23:32] <uGoMobi> although you could fix that in your custom code
[05:23:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also on ios scrolling will very often cause the panel to close
[05:23:56] <uGoMobi> the page gets a class when the panel is open
[05:24:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: isn't there an open ticket for scroll triggering swipe?
[05:24:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no its closed wont fix
[05:25:14] <arschmitz> it would be too big of a performance hit to fix it and its ios only
[05:25:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that page about ThemeRoller looks nice!
[05:26:04] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah i like the purple theme :) lol
[05:26:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm... then we probably can't fix this issue with panel either
[05:26:29] <uGoMobi> because it sounds the same to me
[05:26:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it is the same
[05:26:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats why i think swipe to close should be an option
[05:27:26] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[05:27:27] <uGoMobi> yeah but if you set the option to true you expect it to work on iOS
[05:27:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we would just need to document it
[05:27:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you think we should give that issue another look?
[05:28:01] <arschmitz> and there is an extension to fix the issue 
[05:28:09] <uGoMobi> aha
[05:28:13] <uGoMobi> i was about to ask that :)
[05:28:28] <arschmitz> if you dont my calculating scrolltop on every touch start / end
[05:29:06] <uGoMobi> ah https://github.com/arschmitz/JQM-Swipefix/blob/master/swipefix.js
[05:29:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup thats the one
[05:29:42] <uGoMobi> of course
[05:29:58] <uGoMobi> we should set up test page with your extension then
[05:30:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[05:30:21] <uGoMobi> but let's merge range branch first :)
[05:30:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah sounds good!
[05:31:04] <arschmitz> i think those tests are good to start
[05:31:05] <uGoMobi> and have some other demos that i want to finish
[05:31:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: one question about the handles
[05:31:39] <uGoMobi> they are in the source code in reversed order
[05:31:48] <uGoMobi> at least on Chrome
[05:32:03] <arschmitz> what do you mean?
[05:32:43] <uGoMobi> $( ".ui-slider-handle" ).first() will select the right/last handle
[05:33:23] <uGoMobi> because the right button (the anchor element) comes before the left one
[05:33:38] <arschmitz> oh i see
[05:33:48] <arschmitz> i should fix that
[05:34:10] <uGoMobi> yeah it's not a biggy but kinda counter-intuitive
[05:34:19] <uGoMobi> or is it contra- ?
[05:34:20] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:34:27] <uGoMobi> well you know what I mean :)
[05:34:37] <arschmitz> yeah its just my not thinking about it when i switched to single track
[05:34:54] <arschmitz> i just went append(handle)
[05:35:01] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:35:05] <arschmitz> but since its the first one it should have been prepend
[05:35:32] <uGoMobi> maybe we can add a test later to check if handle position changed correctly or something
[05:35:42] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:36:28] <arschmitz> i also want to add one to make sure no event is emmited if that handles are equal and and you try to change them or set them equal again
[05:36:55] <uGoMobi> yeah that's a good one too
[05:37:28] <arschmitz> but we can add those later
[05:37:40] <uGoMobi> yes, I think we should merge
[05:37:45] <uGoMobi> so people start testing
[05:37:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i agree im just making the prepend append change right now
[05:38:02] <arschmitz> then we should do it
[05:38:06] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:38:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BTW - the Android WebView slide panel issue is caused by position fixed for the panel
[05:39:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i saw your comment on that
[05:39:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: figures and somehow it actually works on 2.3 ?? lol
[05:39:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that makes sense
[05:40:06] <uGoMobi> position fixed is only added if 3D transform is used
[05:40:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh ok
[05:40:48] <uGoMobi> something to look into with the Filament guys when they are back from holidays
[05:44:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah they will have a few things to look into lo
[05:44:20] <arschmitz> all those minor issues i found last friday
[05:44:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: though i told them how to fix al those lol so should not be a big deal

[05:46:08] <uGoMobi> yeah nice
[05:47:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we have a merge conflict in slider.css
[05:47:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I can imagine
[05:47:38] <uGoMobi> I rewrote whole file
[05:47:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: seems to be the only conflict though
[05:47:54] <uGoMobi> and applied a fix on master for flip toggle on IE7 last week
[05:48:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no conflict in demos index page?
[05:48:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ahh that must be the conflict
[05:48:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i didnt get one there
[05:48:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: everything on master should be ignored for slider.css
[05:48:49] <uGoMobi> I also fixed that issue in branche range
[05:48:53] <arschmitz> ok
[05:50:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i take that back there are conflicts in slider unit tests and demos index.html
[05:51:15] <uGoMobi> demos index.html is simple.... master is leading... just one list divider "Sliders" and two list items with links to demo pages should be added
[05:51:46] <arschmitz> and tests i assume it should be the one from range
[05:52:19] <uGoMobi> rangeslider is new folder in /tests/unit/ so that shouldn't cause a conflict
[05:52:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no its your change to slider/index.html
[05:52:45] <uGoMobi> I fixed something on slider test index.html tho
[05:52:50] <uGoMobi> right
[05:52:56] <uGoMobi> closing body tag
[05:53:04] <uGoMobi> and some indent changes at the bottom
[05:54:34] <arschmitz> ok so range is the one i want then right?
[05:54:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure what you mean
[05:55:07] <arschmitz> the index.html on the range branch is the most uptodate
[05:55:14] <arschmitz> all the changes are in range branch
[05:55:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok... yes
[05:55:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so only think i actually need to fix is demos/index.html
[05:55:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry I confused range (branch) with rangeslider (folder)
[05:55:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah it gets weird sometimes
[05:56:03] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:56:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: take master for demos index.html and paste the 3 LI's in there and it will be fine
[05:57:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats what im doing right now :)
[05:57:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool :)
[06:02:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok all merged

[07:11:08] <toddmparker_> good morning and almost happy new year
[07:11:44] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker_ 
[07:12:26] <toddmparker_> awesome work on the range slider arschmitz (and uGoMobi) 
[07:12:36] <toddmparker_> so that's in master now?
[07:12:39] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: thank you
[07:12:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yup all merged complete with tests
[07:12:57] <toddmparker_> sweet!
[07:13:03] <toddmparker_> man, you guys beat us on panel
[07:13:06] <toddmparker_> bastards
[07:13:10] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:13:22] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: ha ha yeah and did you see my list of panel issues on friday :)
[07:13:25] <uGoMobi> we might want to add a few more tests tho
[07:13:31] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: you had mention an issue with panels here earlier, right?
[07:13:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah a few lol 
[07:13:56] <arschmitz> also just commented on webivew issue on github
[07:13:58] <toddmparker_> sure, we can keep adding test, docs and demos up to 1.3 final
[07:14:08] <toddmparker_> I just responded there too
[07:14:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: it was a response to your response
[07:14:32] <toddmparker_> 4.0 is very shaky transition-wise IMHO so I think we shoudl just manually fail it out on that 3D test
[07:14:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi and i got the issue on 4.1 also
[07:14:39] <toddmparker_> ah, lemme look
[07:15:01] <toddmparker_> oh, that's bad
[07:15:20] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes transitions don't look good on 4.1 in browser either
[07:15:25] <toddmparker_> so android can't handle fixed positon on an element that has been translated?
[07:15:34] <toddmparker_> brb
[07:16:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we broke the reset tests with the merge
[07:16:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: already fixed it though
[07:17:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I thought I updated all class names... test were fine in branch range
[07:17:19] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Hi :-) I've put the tutorial for themeroller on the learn site, if you want to have a look: http://stage.learn.jquery.com/jquery-mobile/theme-roller/ 
[07:17:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: weird did you run the reset tests? it still had the old class name in there
[07:18:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ohw reset tests
[07:18:26] <toddmparker_> agcolom: that article looks great
[07:18:31] <toddmparker_> like the purple theme
[07:18:39] <uGoMobi> I think I missed those arschmitz 
[07:18:44] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: THATS WHAT I SAID LOL
[07:18:49] <agcolom> thanks :-) 
[07:18:50] <uGoMobi> thanks for fixing
[07:19:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it was just one class nothing big
[07:19:35] <toddmparker_> when i was testing panels on my nexus 7 (4.1) they seemed smooth to me, no blinks or anything
[07:19:57] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: in a webview?
[07:19:58] <agcolom> btw I'll be traveling from the south of France to Paris on Thursday, so won't be able to attend the meeting...
[07:20:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I saw blink on Galaxy Nexus
[07:20:04] <toddmparker_> problem with 4.0 is a lot of 2.3-class devices were upgraded and are especially dodgy
[07:20:13] <toddmparker_> 4.0 is rough even on hardware designed for it
[07:20:24] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: bah
[07:20:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker_:i was on a galexy nexus 
[07:20:47] <toddmparker_> funny because we're just doing a bit of translateX, nothing else
[07:20:56] <toddmparker_> can't get much more simple
[07:21:01] <uGoMobi> yes the upgraded devices are worse :(
[07:21:28] <toddmparker_> if you take off the position:fixed, are transitions smooth on your devices?
[07:21:43] <toddmparker_> (sorry for the Q's, not at work so I don't have any test devices)
[07:21:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah even 4.1 isnt great we discovered putting 50+ sliders on a single page will make all versions of android just give up and start crying lol
[07:22:24] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: they seemed ok
[07:22:29] <toddmparker_> i can see that. 50 sliders. just. don't.
[07:22:35] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:22:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker_ yeah that was our conclusion
[07:22:45] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: so it's fixed that is causing all the issues?
[07:22:52] <arschmitz> though its fine on ios5 iphone 4 lol
[07:23:05] <toddmparker_> we can further qualify the fixed rules then
[07:23:27] <toddmparker_> CSS works great as long as you don't use more than one property at a time on a page :)
[07:23:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: can you check for a webview on android like you can on ios?
[07:23:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: the header is an issue
[07:24:01] <uGoMobi> it's on top of the panel
[07:24:04] <uGoMobi> we can look into that
[07:24:06] <arschmitz> if so this is only in webviews
[07:24:10] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: mind commenting on the panel issue with that bug you saw?
[07:24:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: sure
[07:24:38] <uGoMobi> but because of that you don't get clear view of how the transition
[07:24:46] <uGoMobi> look
[07:24:49] <toddmparker_> arschmitz and uGoMobi - ah, so the animation performance is only an issue in a webview. it's ok in chrome/default browser?
[07:25:19] <uGoMobi> the animation didn't look very smooth in the browser either
[07:25:23] <uGoMobi> there is a blink
[07:25:36] <toddmparker_> wonder if there is a way to key off something in the webview to nix fixed
[07:25:37] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[07:25:39] <uGoMobi> let me test if it's both default browser and chrome
[07:26:03] <toddmparker_> man, so many flavors of android. i was testing on about 5 android devices and scott had 3 more but you never know
[07:26:24] <toddmparker_> if you guys have any ideas on how to refine, i'd appreciate the help
[07:26:41] <toddmparker_> hard not having my usual pile of devices
[07:27:05] <arschmitz> toddmparker_:worked fine for me on default browser
[07:27:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: just posted two issues i saw with fixes for them
[07:27:55] <uGoMobi> it's not really a blink that i see
[07:28:08] <uGoMobi> more a redraw during transition
[07:28:14] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: also i personally think swipe to close should be an option for 2 reasons
[07:29:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: using any type of slider inside a panel will cause the panel to close (slideing handle = swipe)
[07:29:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: on ios scrolling will very often cause the panel to closer
[07:34:31] <uGoMobi> 4.1 browser: overlay + push: blink on panel, reveal: no blink but problems with header (doesn't slide with content and there is a redraw at end of transition)
[07:35:43] <uGoMobi> 4.1 Chrome: only something with reveal (looks like a redraw of the content/header during the transition)
[07:36:59] <uGoMobi> this is both with and without position fixed for the panel
[07:44:54] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15arschmitz pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/aley9Q
[07:44:54] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 149ff7722 15Alexander Schmitz: rangeslider: minor performance improvements
[07:45:57] <toddmparker_> hmm. doesn't sound right
[07:46:21] <uGoMobi> I commented on the issue
[07:46:23] <toddmparker_> are these fixed headers?
[07:46:31] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:46:37] <toddmparker_> that is what really complicated things
[07:46:38] <uGoMobi> test page has fixed header
[07:46:51] <toddmparker_> right, trying to keep an eye on that
[07:47:29] <toddmparker_> translateX, fixed positioning on two elements, hardware acceleration - what could go wrong?
[07:47:41] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:47:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: should be a cakewalk on andoird im sure
[07:48:35] <toddmparker_> easy peasy
[07:48:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: one super picky thing i just discovered on friday performance wise
[07:49:11] <toddmparker_> guys - feel free to jump in and make fixes, esp. those logic issues you pointed out uGoMobi 
[07:49:31] <toddmparker_> think it's time to get more eyes and hands on the code
[07:49:39] <arschmitz> should switch from [ 0 ] to get(0) to get native element from jquery object
[07:49:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: i think it was me that pointed out the logic issues unless uGoMobi: found some too
[07:50:04] <uGoMobi> sure, I have to give the code a better look to see why we do certain things the way we do them
[07:52:34] <toddmparker_> oops, right you are arschmitz 
[07:52:41] <toddmparker_> logic master
[07:53:28] <arschmitz> hmm im not so sure about what i said with [0] vs get(0) though re running the jsperf no and looking at other people that have run since i made it is giving mixed results for which is faster
[07:53:28] <toddmparker_> it's odd, we spent days debugging on Android 4.0 and 4.1 but maybe our devices were better
[07:53:35] <toddmparker_> blinking i can see
[07:53:50] <toddmparker_> but functional stuff seems like I would have seen
[07:54:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: will the whole white out issue with fixed is only in a webview
[07:54:41] <arschmitz> so if you didnt test in an android webview you never would have seen
[07:54:51] <toddmparker_> specifically...reveal: no blink on panel, but problems with header. It doesn't slide with content and there is a redraw at end of the transition.
[07:55:04] <toddmparker_> ah, i keep forgetting that
[07:55:22] <toddmparker_> so there are no issues in the browsers? thought there still were some
[07:55:38] <uGoMobi> there are
[07:55:52] <uGoMobi> my comment was about issues with browser
[07:55:58] <uGoMobi> in browser*
[07:56:25] <uGoMobi> reveal: no blink on panel, but problems with header. It doesn't slide with content and there is a redraw at end of the transition.
[07:57:55] <uGoMobi> what I see is that when I click reveal the header is hidden but the space that it leaves  doesn't slide together with the content
[07:58:43] <uGoMobi> at the end of the transition there is a redraw that fix the gap
[08:01:00] <uGoMobi> and to be clear... removing position fixed for the panel doesn't change any of this
[08:01:18] <toddmparker_> fun, ok
[08:01:46] <uGoMobi> so position fixed is only the cause of the WebView issue on 4.0/4.1 where you don't see the panel at all
[08:01:59] <uGoMobi> will keep looking into this
[08:03:44] <toddmparker_> hmm
[08:03:50] <toddmparker_> I really appreciate the help
[08:04:09] <toddmparker_> Scott and I can look at this a bit, but we're under a big deadline for Thursday unfortunately
[08:04:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: ill take care of the two logic issue's did you see what i said about making swipe to close an option?
[08:04:35] <toddmparker_> that reminds me, I'm going to be in a meeting all day on THursday. I think we should do a meeting but just w/o me
[08:05:04] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: thanks and adding an option for that sounds good
[08:05:39] <toddmparker_> brb, need more coffee
[08:05:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: ok ill take care of those i already have them done in a local version im using for a project
[08:07:45] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: on the bright side iv been using a panel a lot in this project and over all it works great just those minor things i mentioned

[08:17:01] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: that's good to hear
[08:17:41] <toddmparker_> someone said the original one jason did worked better on android but they seemed to use roughly the same approaches
[08:17:53] <toddmparker_> this is all black magic
[08:18:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: that branch is still up right/
[08:18:07] <uGoMobi> ?
[08:18:13] <toddmparker_> yep
[08:18:15] <uGoMobi> the one with Jason his version
[08:18:25] <uGoMobi> ok I will compare on same device
[08:18:35] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/SlidingPanel/index.html
[08:18:53] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah they were talking specificly about in a webview in that comment if im not mistaken.
[08:19:22] <uGoMobi> brb
[08:19:26] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5163#issuecomment-11698251
[08:19:30] <toddmparker_> anytime I deal with page-level animations I end up being very discouraged at the end. just doesn't work well to move big things around 
[08:19:40] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: ah, good
[08:20:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: in general webviews on all devices suck lol
[08:20:18] <toddmparker_> mobile devices use a lot of smoke and mirrors to feel fast, but when you ask them to push a lot of pixels forgetaboutit
[08:20:31] <toddmparker_> yeah, they really seem to arschmitz 
[08:20:49] <toddmparker_> so that test app is a good idea - you install it, then just enter in a URL?
[08:21:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: i dont know why they dont just make them the same as the default browser 
[08:21:07] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah it works great
[08:21:11] <toddmparker_> dunno
[08:21:25] <toddmparker_> is there something similar we could use for iOS?
[08:21:29] <arschmitz> they even made it all customized for JQM
[08:21:50] <toddmparker_> I have /test/ saved down to my homescreen which is think is a rough proxy for this
[08:21:57] <toddmparker_> nice
[08:21:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah i can put something together for ios only take like five minutes lol
[08:23:26] <toddmparker_> is a homescreen app in fullscreen mode 100% equal to an' app webview?
[08:23:36] <toddmparker_> I go here and add it so it has the meta: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/config/iOSFullscreen.html
[08:23:36] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yes
[08:23:57] <toddmparker_> cool so no need for an app then
[08:24:10] <toddmparker_> laziness FTW
[08:24:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah i was just going to make  something like that wth an address bar so we can view jsbins etc
[08:24:35] <toddmparker_> oh, good idea
[08:24:38] <arschmitz> basicly enter url go there and stay in webview
[08:25:03] <toddmparker_> so maybe that is the difference with chrome on iOS with popups - that is a pure webview and safari is a bit different
[08:25:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: no i tested
[08:25:28] <arschmitz> in a webview
[08:25:38] <toddmparker_> and it's ok?
[08:25:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yup fine in normal webview
[08:26:05] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: but in chrome it always reloads the page when you close
[08:26:26] <toddmparker_> i saw that bug. so odd.
[08:26:34] <toddmparker_> chrome bug.
[08:26:58] <arschmitz> yeah its just so weird i dont know how you could have a chrome bug the way it works
[08:27:08] <arschmitz> since its not really chrome its just a webview
[08:28:16] <toddmparker_> google found a way to make it worse. good for them.
[08:30:35] <arschmitz> so good of them lol
[08:39:05] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/615
[08:39:25] <arschmitz> ios webview tester
[08:43:34] <toddmparker_> hey awesome
[08:43:48] <toddmparker_> you should put that somewhere more permanent
[08:43:51] <arschmitz> updated to use icon and better title http://jsbin.com/uzaret/618
[08:43:57] <toddmparker_> maybe on the contributing guideline page?
[08:44:06] <toddmparker_> could like that and that other app up?
[08:44:14] <toddmparker_> 618!
[08:44:20] <arschmitz> yeah i think thats a great idea
[08:44:35] <arschmitz> do you think its should go on demos or just throw it on my own server?
[08:45:21] <arschmitz> jsbins dont always load good so dont want to keep it as one
[08:46:18] <toddmparker_> true, sure you could use your server or we could find out how to put this on ours
[08:46:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: maybe get agcolom to link them both up in resources 
[08:46:34] <toddmparker_> actually, you could just add it to the demos somewhere
[08:46:36] <arschmitz> ill just put on mine for now
[08:46:40] <arschmitz> ok
[08:46:45] <arschmitz> thats what i said first ha ha 
[08:46:57] <toddmparker_> wish there was a back button, dang
[08:47:14] <arschmitz> ill put it in demos
[08:47:32] <arschmitz> yeah its sadly not possible with out making a full app with phonegap or something
[08:47:48] <arschmitz> like webslash did for android
[08:48:11] <toddmparker_> yeah, i know. just wish you could do a gesture by default to nav
[08:48:17] <toddmparker_> two finder swipe, etc.
[08:48:22] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: maybe some day if im feeling really ambitious lol
[08:48:38] <toddmparker_> no worries, more of an apple gripe
[08:49:28] <arschmitz> ill post a comment to webslash to see if he minds us posting his app in our demos (i dont think he will)
[08:49:46] <toddmparker_> cool
[09:30:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: agcolom: just so you both know my wife is 100% fine they checked her all out ran tests even did an ultrasound and everything was 100% perfect.
[09:31:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi agcolom: thank you both very much for your concern though
[09:31:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah that's great to hear!
[09:31:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for sure!
[09:31:42] <uGoMobi> must be a relief
[09:31:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[09:33:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so we need to find a place in the docs for the android app for webviews and a ios webview page i made
[09:33:55] <arschmitz> webview viewers just dosent sound good to me lol
[09:34:34] <uGoMobi> lol ok
[09:34:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe add to that checklist todd made
[09:35:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was just going to do it since everything is already made
[09:35:26] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:35:29] <arschmitz> just didnt know what we should call the section or whatever
[09:35:41] <uGoMobi> just add them... we have to give structure a look later anyway
[09:36:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok also just waiting for permission from webslash for the android one though i cant imagine they will mind
[09:36:28] <uGoMobi> yeah, but nice to ask first
[09:37:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: exactly
[09:38:31] <arschmitz> the iOS one isnt anything more then a super simple page but makes it so you can test stuff that dosent have ios-webapp-capible meta in a webview
[09:38:48] <arschmitz> like jsbins
[09:39:05] <arschmitz> though i wonder if we should add that meta to our jsbin template? 
[09:39:15] <arschmitz> dosent do anything unless you add it to homescreen
[09:42:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: i gotta go... enjoy new years eve
[09:42:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you too have a good one 
[09:42:41] <uGoMobi> thanks
[09:42:52] <uGoMobi> happy new year everyone!
