[00:22:53] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #287: SUCCESS in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/287/
[00:22:54] <jqm-jenkins-bot> todd: Adjusted heading level
[01:34:05] <lucian> hello. i'm trying to use jqm only for UI, and it would be very helpful to have an explicit pre-processing API, ideally also usable from node.js, to which I could pass a snippet of html and get back the enhanced one
[01:40:31] <aaronmcadam> bit too early for these guys dude
[01:40:42] <aaronmcadam> try again later on in a few hours
[01:40:58] <aaronmcadam> or else I'll ask the guys later too
[01:41:12] <aaronmcadam> lucian: you on twitter dude? I can ping u with any answers
[01:41:35] <lucian> don't think i have a twitter account, much less a client
[01:41:46] <aaronmcadam> hang on, isn't there an agnostic node preprocessor?
[01:42:17] <aaronmcadam> i think we'd need to have the enhancement in one file and event binding. etc in another
[01:42:50] <aaronmcadam> because wouldn't jqm try to enhance a page regardless?
[01:43:09] <lucian> you can disable that, i think
[01:43:19] <aaronmcadam> not on a root level tho
[01:43:25] <aaronmcadam> on a per el basis, yes
[01:43:34] <lucian> i've been trying to use stuff like $(..).textinput(), but it's a bit limited
[01:43:41] <aaronmcadam> ah no dude
[01:43:45] <aaronmcadam> u don't want per widget shit
[01:43:54] <aaronmcadam> trigger.('change') all the way
[01:44:14] <aaronmcadam> I think we'd need to look at that for 1.1 maybe even further along
[01:44:29] <aaronmcadam> we'd need some rearchitecting
[01:44:40] <lucian> triggering change isn't that helpful, and neither is 'create'
[01:44:43] <aaronmcadam> but transitions are first up for refactor so
[01:44:48] <lucian> because it fails on whole pages
[01:44:57] <aaronmcadam> doesn't for me
[01:45:16] <lucian> if i try to $('<div data-role=page>...').trigger('create')
[01:45:27] <aaronmcadam> oh god
[01:45:30] <aaronmcadam> haha
[01:45:46] <aaronmcadam> creating dynamic pages right
[01:45:49] <lucian> actually i generate it with CoffeeKup, but that's not very important
[01:47:16] <lucian> this is useless $('<div data-role=page><header data-role=header><h1>Bla</h1></header><article data-role=content>ASD</article></div>').trigger('create')
[01:47:23] <lucian> just gives me back the original DOM
[01:47:26] <lucian> no enhancement
[01:47:36] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[01:47:40] <aaronmcadam> cuz nothing is bound to it
[01:47:47] <aaronmcadam> that's why
[01:47:55] <aaronmcadam> ur triggering an event that hasn't been bound
[01:48:07] <lucian> right, good point
[01:48:09] <aaronmcadam> would need something like initialize
[01:48:52] <aaronmcadam> $.mobile.initializePage
[01:49:35] <aaronmcadam> I don't think there's anything stopping enhancement from still parsing the dom looking for data-attrs
[01:49:44] <aaronmcadam> we'd still get the overhead
[01:50:06] <aaronmcadam> and we'd still need events bound to things like collapsibles, listviews, etc
[01:50:18] <lucian> yeah
[01:50:21] <aaronmcadam> the plugins have been decoupled but we'd need a big refactor
[01:50:36] <aaronmcadam> I completely agree with what ur trying to do tho lucian
[01:51:51] <lucian> is there a separate plugin for a page?
[01:52:14] <lucian> ah, there is .page()
[01:52:17] <aaronmcadam> yesh
[01:52:36] <lucian> do you happen to know what gets called by triggering 'create', eventually?
[01:52:40] <lucian> grepping doesn't help
[01:53:41] <aaronmcadam> pageCreate
[01:53:47] <aaronmcadam> pagecreate
[01:55:23] <lucian> thanks, i'll look
[01:55:40] <aaronmcadam> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc4/docs/api/events.html
[01:56:34] <lucian> ah! it degrades inputs! the bastard
[01:56:53] <aaronmcadam> lol
[01:56:58] <aaronmcadam> those poor inputs
[01:58:15] <lucian> i see, they're spread all over the place
[01:58:24] <aaronmcadam> what are
[01:58:25] <lucian> i think i'd very much like a css-only jqm
[01:58:31] <lucian> aaronmcadam: enhancement methods
[01:58:35] <aaronmcadam> yep
[01:58:44] <aaronmcadam> I don't agree
[01:58:55] <aaronmcadam> I used jqTouch for 6 projects and it sucks adding everything yourself
[01:59:10] <lucian> see, i don't really want all the fancy stuff done with JS on jqm
[01:59:19] <aaronmcadam> spose
[01:59:28] <aaronmcadam> why are u using jqm?
[01:59:31] <lucian> i guess i could try using the jqm css directly
[01:59:32] <aaronmcadam> for the touch events?
[01:59:38] <lucian> no, for the widget toolkit
[01:59:48] <aaronmcadam> right, hmm
[01:59:50] <lucian> it's the best alternative to GTK i've seen in a browser
[02:00:05] <aaronmcadam> you might be able to get away with removing the enhancement from the file
[02:00:07] <lucian> i don't particularly mind js in my widgets, i just want them to be programatically composable
[02:00:14] <aaronmcadam> but then you'd have to maintain a hacked together jqm
[02:00:19] <lucian> yeah, i'd rather not
[02:00:28] <aaronmcadam> lol gtk
[02:00:36] <aaronmcadam> the webkit gtk project looks cool tho
[02:00:49] <lucian> gtk has possibly the nicest api i've seen in a UI toolkit
[02:00:58] <lucian> it's also alright functionally (and aesthetically)
[02:01:08] <aaronmcadam> metacity baby
[02:01:24] <lucian> i meant it allows themes to look good if they want to
[02:01:27] <aaronmcadam> it's one thing that still needs work
[02:01:36] <aaronmcadam> the programmatic end of it
[02:01:48] <lucian> so i could write my own enhance function, that calls all the plugins
[02:02:16] <lucian> i wouldn't even need data-role really
[02:02:21] <aaronmcadam> yeah it's not been designed like that tho
[02:02:35] <lucian> ics
[02:13:49] <lucian> aaronmcadam: for now, i'll keep a hack where my html has markup for the page without the content
[02:14:06] <lucian> then on Backbone's view render I fill in the content and change the header/footer
[02:14:10] <lucian> seems to work

[08:54:09] <johnbender> I have to agree todd, this is one of the best teams I've worked with in terms of personality match
[08:54:10] * kinblas scurries off into his corner to bang out a blog article
[08:54:22] <johnbender> hard to believe especially with nerds and oss
[08:54:28] * kinblas gathers everyone into a group hug
[08:54:30] <kinblas> :-)
[08:56:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: does the scale transform require a block level element?
[08:56:38] <johnbender> I want to use it with my code examples to make things larger without affecting the text position below it
[08:56:48] <Wilto> I’m not sure—I don’t think so, but don’t quote me on that.
[08:57:32] <toddmparker_> timmywil: I was going to add you to the blog post but how do i spell your name?
[08:58:01] <kinblas> johnbender: the answer is no, it works on anything ... image is an inline element

[09:12:05] <sven_franck> wilto: leave something to conquer for 1.1 ;-)
[09:16:57] <toddmparker_> wait, who's going to cough up the dough to pay for nokia?
[09:17:07] <toddmparker_> where's my damn crown
[09:17:20] <toddmparker_> so far so good
[09:20:01] <kinblas> jquerymobile.com having some problems eh?
[09:20:58] <Wilto> Yeah, looks like…
[09:21:21] <gseguin> works here
[09:21:42] <gseguin> is it overwhelmed by too much awesomeness?
[09:21:44] <Wilto> Acting a little flaky for me. John said he has some server stuff to sort out.
[09:21:47] <Wilto> Very likely.
[09:22:03] <kinblas> yeah the blog is down

[09:23:19] <toddmparker_> these just don't enhance at all
[09:24:03] <toddmparker_> kinblas: was there an enhance optimization you made that might have impacted radio and checks?
[09:24:10] <gseguin> toddmparker_: did we branch?
[09:24:15] <toddmparker_> seems like these are just not getting enhance at all
[09:24:17] <kinblas> toddmparker_: fyi, I have a bunch of meetings today, so our planned transitions digging is going to be sidetracked till later this afternoon
[09:24:19] <toddmparker_> not yet gseguin
[09:24:26] <toddmparker_> wanna set that up?
[09:24:27] <kinblas> I did however spend some time playing with the CSS
[09:24:31] <gseguin> sure
[09:24:35] <gseguin> what's the branch name?
[09:25:03] <toddmparker_> what did we decide?
[09:25:09] <toddmparker_> 1.0-stable
[09:25:11] <toddmparker_> ?
[09:25:40] <kinblas> toddmparker_: what's broken? I think I only made a change that merged find("input").filter("[type=checkbox]") to find("input[type=checkbox]")
[09:25:55] <gseguin> toddmparker_: sounds good
[09:26:17] <toddmparker_> they are just the native controls, not enhanced at all by the looks of it
[09:26:23] <toddmparker_> only on WP7
[09:26:33] <toddmparker_> not IE7 or WP7.5
[09:26:34] <toddmparker_> odd
[09:26:40] <toddmparker_> kinblas ^^
[09:26:42] <gseguin> toddmparker_: starting now?
[09:26:48] <toddmparker_> sure
[09:26:58] <gseguin> I mean at commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/d5d78f46e1195599b3c4dcb4eef1d75ab9668a1b

[09:27:29] <toddmparker_> not accusing, just asking for clues
[09:27:36] <toddmparker_> could be unrelated
[09:27:37] * kinblas sighs .. is this a a min js thing?
[09:27:39] <Wilto> DAMMIT SCOTT
[09:27:45] <kinblas> heh
[09:27:59] <kinblas> toddmparker_: no worries :-)
[09:28:01] <toddmparker_> gseguin: should we change version.txt to 1.1pre too?
[09:28:10] <gseguin> on master yes
[09:28:12] <Wilto> It’s weird that it’s not busted in legit IE7. I’ll look into it today.
[09:28:24] <toddmparker_> yeah, scottjehl's fault
[09:28:34] <toddmparker_> thanks Wilto
[09:28:51] <toddmparker_> so kin, what were you saying earlier about playing with css?
[09:29:00] <Wilto> In the meantime, somebody do me a favor and submit a pull request for this: https://github.com/Wilto/Dynamic-Carousel/issues/51

[09:29:06] <kinblas> appologies if it was me
[09:29:09] <Wilto> Should be an obvious fix.
[09:29:12] * kinblas hates it when he breaks stuff
[09:29:36] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I was trying to be methodical about ripping out CSS to see when flashing stopped
[09:29:55] <kinblas> it's a combination of things
[09:29:56] <gseguin> branch 1.0-stable created
[09:29:58] <toddmparker_> oh, cool
[09:29:59] <Wilto> I don’t think it’s CSS.
[09:30:17] <toddmparker_> you should start jotting notes into a wiki page
[09:30:21] <Wilto> I was just saying, it’s oddly comforting that it’s wholesale broken and specific to WP7.
[09:30:22] <toddmparker_> it's GOLD
[09:30:24] <kinblas> Wilto: right, it's Android
[09:30:27] <kinblas> :-)
[09:30:44] <Wilto> Oh, thought we still meant the radio/check issue.
[09:30:51] <kinblas> so checkboxes/radios are only broken on WP7? Or only working on WP7?
[09:30:59] <Wilto> Only broken on WP7.
[09:31:03] * kinblas sighs
[09:31:13] <kinblas> I swear things looked ok when I was testing

[09:32:56] <toddmparker_> please let me know if i missed anyone in the thanks. too many people!
[09:33:11] <toddmparker_> kinblas: article?
[09:33:28] <kinblas> toddmparker_: the 1.0 announce on our side
[09:33:32] <toddmparker_> cool
[09:33:40] <gseguin> alright, we're all set for 1.1 and 1.0.1
[09:33:52] <kinblas> toddmparker_: the virtual hug to round things off
[09:35:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/SHM5Hg
[09:35:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3010 from gseguin/issue-2905 - Ghislain Seguin
[09:43:10] <Wilto> We had a link to a page comparing selector performance kicking around in here at one point, yeah?
[09:43:16] <Wilto> Anyone have that?
[09:44:39] <gseguin> kinblas: ^^
[09:45:15] <kinblas> Wilto: I think aaronmcadam was the one that posted it?
[09:45:30] <aaronmcadam> oh yeah
[09:45:31] <kinblas> my Colloquy client crashed before I could copy it
[09:45:57] <aaronmcadam> 1 min lemme find it
[09:46:03] <kinblas> Wilto: there's also a bunch of stuff on jsperf.com, though you'll have to search/wade through stuff
[09:49:29] <aaronmcadam> Wilto: I found it  http://jsperf.com/jquery142-selector-performance-tests/3
[09:51:55] <Wilto> Sweet—thanks, aaronmcadam.
[09:52:03] <aaronmcadam> no prob took a wee while
[09:52:11] <aaronmcadam> there's no profile on jsperf, would be handy
[09:53:44] <Wilto> Yeah, really.
[09:54:32] <aaronmcadam> Wilto, this looks easier, jsperf uses it: npm install benchmark
[09:54:36] <aaronmcadam> Wilto: http://benchmarkjs.com/
[09:54:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: kinblas: did we decide what our branch strategy is going to be?
[09:54:49] <johnbender> gseguin: I know you mentioned the stable branch
[09:54:49] <Wilto> Oh, hel-lo.
[09:55:25] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender
[09:55:43] <toddmparker_> we discussed that above and i think gseguin set this up already
[09:55:52] <toddmparker_> branch for 1.0-stable
[09:56:04] <toddmparker_> version.txt in master is 1.1pre
[09:56:17] <johnbender> cool
[09:56:27] <johnbender> so we'll do bug fixes on stable and merge in as necessary
[09:57:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the only possible issue with that is that if people submit bug fixes they'll need to submit it against the stable branch
[09:57:21] <johnbender> I'm not quite sure how that works with pull requests in github
[09:57:23] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[09:57:51] <johnbender> it seems like its more likely that external contribs will be submitting bug fixes and not as many features
[09:59:28] <toddmparker_> yeah
[09:59:40] <toddmparker_> i'll leave it up to you guys  as gitmasters
[09:59:47] <toddmparker_> this is just what UI and core does
[10:01:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ok I'll go ask them
[10:03:58] <johnbender> gseguin: ok I'm going to talk with the core/UI guys and figure out what the impact might be
[10:07:01] <kinblas> toddmparker_: are we still meeting today?
[10:09:51] <toddmparker_> yep
[10:09:56] <toddmparker_> if you're ok with that
[10:10:02] <toddmparker_> be nice to huddle on 1.next
[10:12:13] <kinblas> ok
[10:12:33] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I loaded the checkbox/radio example in my WP7.5 phone and it looks ok/
[10:13:23] <toddmparker_> think it's WP7 only

[10:24:35] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3093 on jquery-mobile, reported by bitsmix (21m, 47s ago): jquery.mobile-1.0.zip's structure.
[10:24:49] <gseguin> eddiemonge: you've got your extinguisher ?
[10:25:01] <eddiemonge> yeah, whats up?
[10:25:07] <gseguin> ^^^
[10:26:00] * gseguin is catching up
[10:27:50] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3093
[10:27:51] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3093 on jquery-mobile, reported by bitsmix (25m, 3s ago): jquery.mobile-1.0.zip's structure.
[10:28:16] <toddmparker_> sorry for the double post there gseguin
[10:28:38] <gseguin> no worries
[10:29:23] <eddiemonge> ok should be fixed
[10:29:37] <gseguin> eddiemonge: you're probably missing either a "cd" before calling zip or a "-d" or something of that sort
[10:31:17] <gseguin> eddiemonge: did you fix it directly on the cdn?
[10:31:21] <eddiemonge> yeah
[10:31:28] <eddiemonge> i think it needs -D
[10:31:33] <eddiemonge> like you said
[10:32:12] <toddmparker_> another issue
[10:32:38] <toddmparker_> if you download the zip and open index.html in the docs folder
[10:32:51] <toddmparker_> icons are missing, links broken
[10:32:55] <toddmparker_> or is that fixed too?
[10:33:06] <toddmparker_> i just d/l 1 minute ago
[10:33:08] <eddiemonge> let me check
[10:34:06] <toddmparker_> kk eddiemonge
[10:34:15] <toddmparker_> otherwise, zip looks nice and clean
[10:36:57] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: jquery.mobile-1.0/demos/index.html ?
[10:39:31] <toddmparker_> non-min css and js seem missing
[10:39:32] <toddmparker_> busted: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0/jquery.mobile-1.0.js
[10:39:40] <gseguin> johnbender: is a pull request against master only or can it be against a branch?
[10:39:40] <toddmparker_> ok: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0/jquery.mobile-1.0.min.js
[10:39:53] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge ^^
[10:40:03] <toddmparker_> see links at bottom of blog post
[10:40:38] <eddiemonge> non-min works for me
[10:40:44] <eddiemonge> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0/jquery.mobile-1.0.css
[10:40:46] <eddiemonge> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0/jquery.mobile-1.0.js
[10:40:48] <eddiemonge> both work
[10:41:42] <gseguin> works but header is missing version
[10:42:26] <toddmparker_> odd, working for me again
[10:42:30] <toddmparker_> nevermind
[10:43:07] <eddiemonge> oh lol
[10:43:15] <eddiemonge> i know why the version is different
[10:46:50] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge - what is it?
[10:47:35] <eddiemonge> i never told it to replace it with the official version
[10:48:03] <eddiemonge> fixing it and uploading the hot fix
[10:53:04] <Wilto> O kinblas, Keeper of Performance! I request an audience with you, sir!
[10:53:36] <kinblas> Wilto: I hereby grant thee the privilige of speaking to me, just don't look into my eyes
[10:53:46] <Wilto> Yes, sir. Of course, sir.
[10:53:54] <kinblas> so did I bust WP7?
[10:54:01] <Wilto> “Kinda.”
[10:54:03] <kinblas> ugh
[10:54:26] <Wilto> WP7 is choking on a find() for a “for” attribute.
[10:54:28] <kinblas> which was it? the filter change in checkboxradio?
[10:54:33] <Wilto> It does not choke on .filter(), however.
[10:54:42] <Wilto> Thus: http://jsperf.com/filter-v-find
[10:54:59] <kinblas> hmmm, well filter goes through sizzle
[10:55:08] <kinblas> so that's probably why it works
[10:55:09] <Wilto> It’s slower for certain.
[10:55:15] <Wilto> Oh, wait, I have an idea.
[10:55:32] <Wilto> I’ll only run it through “filter” if find returns nothing.
[10:56:32] * kinblas looks up IE7 attribute selector support
[10:56:46] <Wilto> IE7 is okay with using find.
[10:56:59] <Wilto> Specific to WP7, which is a little weird.
[10:57:06] <kinblas> isn't WP7 using IE7?
[10:57:11] <Wilto> More or less.
[10:57:13] <kinblas> or is it somewhere between IE6 and 7?
[10:57:18] <Wilto> It’s not 1-to-1.
[10:57:33] <Wilto> Yeah. There’s a little IE6 in there, too.
[10:57:57] <Wilto> I’ve never seen IE6 choke on a .find() for an attribute either, though.
[10:58:04] <Wilto> I think it’s a bug unique to WP7.
[10:58:25] <toddmparker_> we doing the google hangout?
[10:58:43] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so how do I get there?
[10:58:58] <toddmparker_> johnbender set it up last time
[10:59:08] <kinblas> do I log into g+?
[10:59:17] * kinblas needs someone to hold his hand
[10:59:22] <kinblas> ... again
[10:59:27] <gseguin> I'll create one
[10:59:43] <gseguin> public, right?
[11:00:14] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ^^
[11:00:44] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:00:46] <toddmparker_> thanks gseguin
[11:00:51] <toddmparker_> public is ok

[11:02:13] <gseguin> oh ok
[11:02:22] <toddmparker_> you set this up gseguin
[11:02:26] <toddmparker_> ?
[11:03:06] <eddiemonge> tis empty
[11:03:32] <toddmparker_> wrong one:

[11:03:37] <toddmparker_> ^^ use this
[11:03:44] <sven_franck> ok
[11:03:57] <kinblas> there's no way to setup something "friendlier"?
[11:04:11] <toddmparker_> it's google. NO
[11:06:35] <toddmparker_> garann?
[11:06:42] <toddmparker_> johnbender?

[11:39:29] <eddiemonge> we could get something like this https://plus.google.com/hangouts/extras/eddiemonge.com/jquerymobiledevmeeting
[11:41:23] <kinblas> eddiemonge: yeah that looks much friendlier and something I can remember
[11:44:53] <eddiemonge> docs source code says beta release still
[11:45:24] <Wilto> Maybe we could just say the docs are in beta.
[11:47:02] <TehShrike|Work> lol
[11:48:13] <eddiemonge> gseguin: can you review this please https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3094
[11:48:13] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (38.284s ago): Fix license version and zip folder
[11:52:34] <kinblas> Wilto: so looking up selector support for IE7 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc351024(v=vs.85).aspx
[11:52:56] <Wilto> No worries, man—I’m doing some tests now.
[11:52:58] <kinblas> is it just the @for attribute it barfs on? Or is it the fact that a value is specified?
[11:53:09] <Wilto> It seems like… Pretty much everything but find is working, in this instance.
[11:53:24] <Wilto> But find DOES work out of this context.
[11:53:49] <kinblas> Wilto: ok I was just wondering if it was some specific syntax that we should avoid
[11:53:58] <Wilto> I’m wondering if it’s that we’re looking for it within multiple elements: … "form,fieldset,:jqmData(role='page')" ).find( …
[11:53:59] <kinblas> with single quotes, with double quotes, with value
[11:54:02] <Wilto> No, not that I’ve ever seen.
[11:54:29] <Wilto> Never seen anything along these lines in IE7 (Desktop), and nothing else seems busted that uses find() on WP7.
[11:54:50] <Wilto> http://jsperf.com/filter-v-find
[11:55:55] <Wilto> Added some things, just out of curiosity. Find and the fifth one are identical in terms of perf on WP7, but also the only ones that haven’t worked (again, just in this context, so it’s something specific here).
[11:56:42] <Wilto> Loves me some weird IE issues.
[11:57:03] <Wilto> I’m… I’m not sure I’m being facetious there. I worry about my mind sometimes.
[11:58:05] <kinblas> heh
[12:17:11] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: well, *I* think I won the bakeoff
[12:17:45] <Wilto> Hell yeah, man.
[12:18:02] <johnbender> Dave Kaneda has a _really_ nice presentation
[12:18:07] <johnbender> keynote I think
[12:18:09] <johnbender> with videos and crap
[12:18:36] <johnbender> but I think I won with content and the project philisophy
[12:18:47] <johnbender> He's a super cool guy
[12:46:29] <johnbender> kinblas: are we doing that catchup today?
[12:46:57] <johnbender> kinblas: just checked my email
[12:47:00] <johnbender> and I have my answer
[12:47:14] <gseguin> johnbender: how long are you in town for?
[12:48:11] <johnbender> gseguin: until tomorrow
[12:48:18] <johnbender> gseguin: where are you guys located?
[12:48:25] <gseguin> in Palo Alto
[12:48:25] <johnbender> and have you had lunch today?
[12:48:27] <johnbender> ah
[12:48:35] <johnbender> hrm
[12:48:44] <gseguin> yeah done with lunch
[12:49:36] <johnbender> I have a close friend I'm trying to set up lunch with today or tomorrow
[12:49:39] <johnbender> and I'm in the city
[12:50:17] <johnbender> toddparker: toddmparker_ kinblas gseguin Wilto when are we going to do our rebase chat?
[12:50:47] <Wilto> We’re havin’ one?
[12:50:56] <Wilto> REBASE 4-LYFE, here.
[12:51:23] <jzaefferer> congrats everyone for the 1.0 release!
[12:51:28] <gseguin> whenever, but I haven't merged upstream/master to master since you told me not to
[12:51:36] <Wilto> Thanks, Jörn!
[12:51:49] <jzaefferer> used it almost a year ago and am about to start another (small) project soon :-)
[12:51:50] <gseguin> thanks  jzaefferer!
[12:52:20] <johnbender> gseguin: I thought we had done the tree trimming at that point so feel free to. Sorry :(
[12:52:28] <johnbender> jzaefferer: thanks man
[12:52:41] <Wilto> Rebase that sucker, gseguin.
[12:53:11] <gseguin> oh are you talking about reducing the repo size?
[12:53:40] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[12:54:54] <gseguin> that's a good point actually
[12:55:35] <gseguin> toddmparker_: Who can give write access to timmywil for him to push his changes?
[12:56:23] <gseguin> toddparker: ^
[13:01:03] <jzaefferer> so now that 1.0 is out, you're ready to mess up your entire repo?
[13:02:09] <gseguin> yeah time to do some spring clean up to downsized our 100+Mb repo
[13:02:20] <gseguin> s/downsized/downsize/
[13:12:48] <Wilto> Waitasec. Hey, kinblas:
[13:12:51] <Wilto> Or anybody, really.
[13:13:10] <Wilto> The line that’s giving me all this grief is “	label = input.closest( "form,fieldset,:jqmData(role='page')" ).find( "label[for='" + input[ 0 ].id + "']")”
[13:13:39] <Wilto> Can’t we pretty safely assume one label per input—so just $( "label[for='" + input[ 0 ].id + "']" ) would work, right?
[13:17:34] <kinblas> Wilto: but we're trying to scope the search to less than the entire doc
[13:18:08] <kinblas> so basically it's looking for the closest parent that would wrap both the input and the label
[13:20:09] <sven_franck> 1.0 sure is fast. Even the debug version feels like Ferrari :-)
[13:23:15] <kinblas> :-)
[13:26:28] <gseguin> kinblas: http://mobilehtml5.org/ does mention "Position: fixed support"
[13:26:45] <kinblas> doh
[13:27:27] <gseguin> for the other ones we probably need to ping @firt
[13:33:51] <Wilto> why does windows phone hate me
[13:43:09] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: nocturnal self contact?
[13:52:15] <johnbender> gseguin: so I talked with DaveMethin about the branching that core and ui do
[13:52:23] <johnbender> and it sounds like stable is mostly just a tag
[13:53:13] <gseguin> so how do they handle sustaining on a version?
[13:53:42] <DaveMethvin> we don't :D
[13:53:49] <gseguin> heh :)
[13:53:59] <DaveMethvin> once it's shipped we're on to the next
[13:54:20] <DaveMethvin> gnarf has been tryna sweet talk us into a stable branch
[13:54:46] <johnbender> gseguin: I was thinking it might better to let master be stable where we can patch and accept bug fixes, and then branch off for the next release
[13:54:52] <gseguin> I was under the impression that we were setting ourself up for a 1.0.1 bugfix release
[13:54:57] <johnbender> realizing that it might be non standard
[13:55:06] <gseguin> because 1.1 is a few months away
[13:55:13] <johnbender> gseguin: thats what I was thinking would be the goal
[13:55:26] <johnbender> gseguin: eithe way we do it
[13:55:33] <johnbender> stable as a branch or master
[13:55:50] <Wilto> kinblas: I… I am ashamed.
[13:56:07] <johnbender> I need to do some reading on branching strats out there though, I'll ask some of my other oss friends what they do in their projects
[13:56:22] <Wilto> The most effective selector I can cobble together for this is 56% slower on Windows Phone 7.
[13:56:33] <johnbender> gseguin: either way we can change it when we want
[13:56:40] <gseguin> cool, keep me posted I'm open to whatever makes sense
[13:56:50] <gseguin> I just did the way I know
[13:57:15] <gseguin> johnbender: are PR limited to master?
[13:57:16] <Wilto> kinblas: But it makes it un-broke, so I dunno if we want to push this and revisit it later or what. This is your turf—I defer to you.
[13:59:56] <kinblas> Wilto: can we do a quick test with your test case?
[14:00:03] <kinblas> using  a bookmarklet
[14:00:06] <Wilto> Speed?
[14:00:10] <kinblas> yeah
[14:00:15] <kinblas> sorry in a meeting so very distracted
[14:00:17] <Wilto> http://jsperf.com/filter-v-find
[14:00:20] <Wilto> No, no worries.
[14:00:32] <Wilto> I updated that test with the original, and two methods I found that work.
[14:00:37] <kinblas> http://jquerymobile.com/test/tools/page-change-time.html
[14:00:47] <Wilto> Contents is, unsurprisingly, much slower.
[14:01:07] <kinblas> I'm just curious about how much of a change it would be on the gallery page
[14:01:10] <kinblas> form gallery page
[14:01:14] <johnbender> gseguin: no I don't think so but I have to check that
[14:01:19] <johnbender> it was one of my primary concerns
[14:01:26] <johnbender> kinblas: meeting?
[14:01:45] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah dialing in
[14:11:15] <Wilto> Uh, kinblas, lower is better on these, yeah?
[14:12:31] <Wilto> Oh, there we go.
[14:12:38] <gseguin> Wilto, johnbender, kinblas: any objection on landing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3008 ?

[14:30:36] <Wilto> I’d be okay with pulling that is, but let’s hold off for one more “yea” vote.
[14:31:12] <gseguin> sounds good
[14:31:27] <Wilto> s/is/in
[14:33:10] <Wilto> We don’t have any stats on Mango update rates, do we?
[14:33:39] <Wilto> Filed under: sentences I never thought I’d write.
[14:54:57] <kinblas> Wilto: sorry was in a meeting
[14:55:03] <Wilto> Ah, no worries man.
[14:55:05] <kinblas> that doesn't seem like much of a performance diff
[14:55:06] <sven_franck> customized JQM1.0 only "stole" my popup triangles. I can live with that...
[14:55:23] <kinblas> Wilto: do you have a mango phone you can try it on?
[14:55:27] <Wilto> Yeah. Plus Todd and I were talking, and we’ve got tons of time before we need to stress out about a release—we can circle back.
[14:55:30] <Wilto> Do I!
[14:55:41] <kinblas> Wilto: yeah so go ahead and revert?
[14:55:55] <kinblas> Wilto: that's in the checkboxradio.js file right?
[14:55:59] <Wilto> Yessir.
[14:56:43] * kinblas notes that the big win wasn't that change but the one in the controlGroup he made at the same time
[14:56:56] <Wilto> Oh, nice.
[14:57:05] <kinblas> Wilto: I think I just chaged it because I knew it *WAS* slower
[14:57:12] <kinblas> I did that same jsperf test
[14:57:14] <Wilto> For sure.
[14:57:34] <kinblas> Wilto: as long as we don't reintroduce 200-300ms on Mango
[14:57:35] <toddmparker_> hey all
[14:57:36] <kinblas> I'm cool
[14:57:40] <toddmparker_> sorry, was in a looong meeting
[14:58:02] <kinblas> toddmparker_: we've decided to drop mobile and focus on desktop while you were out
[14:58:10] <Wilto> Oh, hey, we’re still working on “master,” yeah?
[14:58:25] <Wilto> I mean, this fix should be part of 1.0.x, I figure.
[14:58:28] <kinblas> Wilto: not sure, did we branch 1.0 maintenance?
[14:58:36] <Wilto> No idea.
[14:58:37] <toddmparker_> cool. mobile is lame.
[14:58:50] <toddmparker_> does that mean no android? hurray!
[14:59:27] <kinblas> you haven't heard? Android is the new Desktop OS?
[14:59:37] <Wilto> NOOOO
[14:59:41] <kinblas> Wilto: looks like gseguin created 1.0-stable
[15:00:02] <Wilto> “Stable” feels like something I shouldn’t touch.
[15:00:06] <kinblas> lol
[15:00:36] <Wilto> On a couple of levels, really.
[15:03:10] <Wilto> But yeah, so, push this change to 1.0-stable, then?
[15:04:10] <gseguin> both master and 1.0-stable
[15:06:12] <Wilto> …This might be a dumb question, but is there a “push to x and y” thing I can do here?
[15:06:27] <Wilto> fetch upstream master
[15:06:32] <Wilto> rebase upstream/master
[15:06:41] <Wilto> push origin master
[15:06:49] <Wilto> And then: push origin 1.0-stable
[15:06:51] <Wilto> ?
