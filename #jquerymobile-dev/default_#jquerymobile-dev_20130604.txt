[00:28:07] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[00:30:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in branch "next" the field container shouldn't get class ui-body
[00:48:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually the scrollbar is caused by overflow-x hidden for ui-content
[00:49:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6421966/css-overflow-x-visible-and-overflow-y-hidden-causes-scroll-bar for explanation
[01:07:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I noticed that too. Setting overflow-x to hidden causes overflow-y to become auto, even though it's explicitly set to visible. Weird.
[01:07:48] * _|Nix|_ go read that now
[01:08:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Weird then that, in master, if I remove ui-body, it works.
[01:08:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That is, the clipping doesn't happen.
[01:10:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think that is because of position relative for ui-body
[01:10:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, that's actually it.
[01:11:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when you remove that the popup becomes positioned relative to ui-content
[01:11:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: As for the SO article, that's just a description of what's going on. It doesn't tell me /why/ the other value is set to auto.
[01:11:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, but it also becomes /clipped/ differently.
[01:12:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't understand /why/ you can't have overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: visible;
[01:14:40] <_|Nix|_> Looking at http://www.brunildo.org/test/Overflowxy2.html I see that there is no way to make y visible if you set x to anything other than visible. This is extremely st00pid.
[01:14:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because of the specs
[01:22:38] <_|Nix|_> This is a completely idiotic part of the spec. What does x have to do with y?
[01:24:58] <_|Nix|_> OK, so why is position: relative also causing clipping?
[01:25:27] <_|Nix|_> Does .ui-field-contain.ui-body absolutely need position: relative?
[01:30:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's completely different in "next"
[01:30:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no more ui-body for field containers
[01:31:23] <uGoMobi> and the label and form widget inside the field container are floating
[01:31:37] <uGoMobi> so there is also a clearfix for the field container
[01:32:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm an idiot. I should really pull before I test with next ...
[01:33:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If ui-body is gone from fieldcontain we should be in the clear. There are still some issues with the themeing, and I need to calculate coordinates differently, because now they can be relative to anything, but other than that, we should be good.
[01:34:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course, those who are already using popup may experience breakage because they may have placed the popup inside divs which will cause it to get clipped.
[01:34:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but I think the bugs this fixes with forms are worth the breakage.
[01:39:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In "next", it's still clipped, because fieldcontain still gets position: relative, but directly from .ui-field-contain ...

[01:53:24] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06popup-not-relocated 14b9f048a 15Gabriel Schulhof: Popup: Do not relocate directly into the page.
[01:58:16] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, so http://view.jquerymobile.com/popup-not-relocated/popup-clipping.html
[02:04:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wait a sec! There's no point /not/ relocating the popup. In HTML5 you can specify <input form="someFormPresentSomewhereInTheDocument"></input> for any input.
[02:05:26] <_|Nix|_> So, even if the input is outside the <form>...</form> pair, you can still make it part of the form.
[02:05:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: heh, didn't know that
[02:06:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can give that position relative for ui-field-contain a look... not sure if it's really needed
[02:07:06] <uGoMobi> I think I added it because I was removing class ui-body and added prop/values from ui-body to ui-field-contain
[02:07:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Forget it. If we don't need to relocate the popup, then it's wasted effort.
[02:07:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course, it's not wasted effort for minimizing CSS.
[02:08:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So yeah, sorry ... I'm a bit overwhelmed at the realization that when popup's _create() causes inputs to be ripped out of their parent forms it's not a reason to re-write popup.
[02:08:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, will give that a look later anyway when testing
[02:09:07] <_|Nix|_> I'm checking on caniuse.com whether form="#formID" is supported everywhere.
[02:09:14] <uGoMobi> great
[02:09:42] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... I don't think it's there.
[02:10:36] <_|Nix|_> IEEEEEEEE! I keel yu!
[02:13:18] <_|Nix|_> What percent of the market is IE again?
[02:13:45] <_|Nix|_> Doesn't even work in IE10!
[02:14:38] <uGoMobi> :(
[02:23:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I checked if position relative was added for ui-body to fix an issue, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I think it's safe to remove  it from ui-field-contain rule
[02:23:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Let's try it and watch things blow up.
[02:24:02] <_|Nix|_> I'll do it on that new branch.
[02:24:12] <uGoMobi> okay
[02:25:22] <_|Nix|_> OK. As expected. Clipping's gone. Now, I need to fix the coordinate calculation, because the popup gets placed differently depending on whether it's inside the fieldcontain or not.
[02:28:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is this only a field contain problem? sounds like as soon as popup is inside a positioned element it will be positioned differently
[02:30:13] <uGoMobi> what happens when a popup is inside a fixed toolbar?
[02:40:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm working on making sure that coordinates are calculated and set irrespective of that.
[02:40:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If it's a matter of calculation, then I should be able to make it work.
[02:40:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok nice
[02:53:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK ... weird ... a different menu size is reported for the menu inside the fieldcontain than the menu outside the fieldcontain, yet the size on screen ends up the same.
[02:54:21] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15mrextreme opened issue #6074: jQM 1.3 with panel dies on jQuery v2  02http://git.io/vXEi0w
[02:54:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: could it be we set box-sizing border-box?
[02:54:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess the box-sizing could be different ...
[02:55:55] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... why is the heoight 1x1 when it's not on screen? It's not hidden ...
[02:57:13] <_|Nix|_> I mean why are the dimensions 1x1
[03:02:17] <_|Nix|_> OK. I know what the problem is. The popup's initial location causes text inside to be wrapped.
[03:02:25] <_|Nix|_> ... thus changing the size.
[03:05:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ui-popup-hidden has clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px)
[03:06:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You added that instead of width: 1px, height: 1px in bf9c2d307eec1bbd75156ecd846eb5b1e8f1b104 (Improvements to and consistency in accessible hiding content.)
[03:06:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[03:07:15] <_|Nix|_> Oh, and you also added width: 1px, height: 1px;
[03:07:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Did you do that in case the location doesn't end up at -9999px, -9999px?
[03:07:56] <uGoMobi> I thought it made sense to use same rules when it comes to accessibly hiding content
[03:08:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, for sure ... I guess I might need a class that removes all that right before displaying the popup.
[03:08:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I checked some posts about best way to do it
[03:09:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: related https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3851
[03:10:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah you're right, easiest would be if we were using SASS and have a mixin to move it off screen and one that negates all of that 
[03:21:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, actually, I need a class that does everything ui-popup-hidden does, except the width/height/clipping.
[03:22:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That way, I could add that class, remove ui-popup-hidden, make my calculation, and remove that class.
[03:22:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or, I could add left: 0, top: 0 to ui-popup.
[03:26:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Adding left: -9999px; top: -9999px; to ui-popup-container made it work.
[03:27:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It doesn't matter if it's on the container (which is never removed), because whenever the popup is shown, the coordinates will be assigned to the inline style anyway.
[03:27:58] <uGoMobi> ok good
[03:28:27] <_|Nix|_> Of course, I cannot fathom the host of issues this might bring up ...
[03:29:24] <_|Nix|_> So, basically, if we go with this approach (popups stay where they are) we'll need to document that they'll be sensitive to clipping.
[03:30:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thinking that we might not even need the top and left -9999px for the hidden popup
[03:31:24] <uGoMobi> maybe I combined several methods and we do too much now :/
[03:32:34] <uGoMobi> when it's 1 by 1 px there and visibility is hidden I don't think there is a need to set the offset as well
[03:33:58] <uGoMobi> also, clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); can be removed because IE7 will become C-grade
[03:34:12] <uGoMobi> we only need the comma separated one
[03:34:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[03:34:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, wait ... doesn't C-grade mean no JS? CSS is still present, right?
[03:34:54] <uGoMobi> quess there is some of that in popup.arrow as well
[03:35:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, but if the JS doesn't add the class the CSS won't be used
[03:35:22] <_|Nix|_> Of course ... duuuuh :)
[03:35:26] <uGoMobi> lol
[03:36:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... so popup arrow CSS can also be reduced.
[03:36:07] <uGoMobi> nice
[03:36:44] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I think I'll go back to next and help with unit test cleanup. Then, I'll merge popup-not-relocated.
[03:36:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will discuss the CSS for accessibly hidden content with the guys from Filament
[03:36:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[03:37:05] <uGoMobi> feels like we do a bit too much now
[03:38:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: re: unit tests... those are the ones that aren't updated yet: collapsible, select (unit + integration), reset
[03:38:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[03:39:21] <_|Nix|_> reset should be fine ... I'll have a look at reset first ...
[03:39:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that's just a matter of updating to new markup
[03:39:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll also fix the linting.
[03:40:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: awesome!
[03:40:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think there is a regression from this commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/285c33c80a1f389985e60fa0dcdf5d7ebe47cd9f
[03:41:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: focus issue with custom select
[03:42:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when a select menu opens in a popup no button gets focus
[03:42:37] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... probably the wrong selector.
[03:43:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: could be, didn't really looked into it yet but noticed it doesn't work anymore
[03:43:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[03:45:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I have to prepare a JQM workshop and presentation for thursday/friday so I don't have time at the moment to work on "next", sorry
[03:49:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP. I can do some cleanup. Hope I don't break anything :-S
[04:00:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yaaay! I got it down to 8 warnings!
[04:01:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good job!

[07:05:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[07:05:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The collapsibleSet integration test expects that a collapsible in a set with swatch "d" set swatch "d" for itself. However, this is no longer true, because it's CSS-inherited now, right?
[07:06:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wonder if we could test this. I guess not without looking at the computed style, eh?
[07:12:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[07:12:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I did this at two other places
[07:12:56] <uGoMobi> let me check
[07:14:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see checkboxradio test
[07:15:39] <_|Nix|_> I see - you explicitly check the background-color ...
[07:15:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I added relevant theme style in the head and then check with .css() if it is applied
[07:15:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[07:15:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, background color isn't inherited
[07:16:02] <_|Nix|_> OK, so I have to edit the index.html ...
[07:16:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll copy the stuff from checkboxradio ...
[07:16:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure
[07:16:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... adjusting the scope to apply to collapsibles.
[07:17:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what scope do you want to change?
[07:17:29] <uGoMobi> this is just theme CSS that applies button styling, also collapsible heading button
[07:19:03] <uGoMobi> I only included button theme from swatch A there so you can test if it inherits from collapsible set with theme A
[07:19:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, cool ... NM ... there's nothing widget-specific in that bit of CSS.
[07:19:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nope
[07:20:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll make the changes ...
[07:20:36] <uGoMobi> if you want to test overrides... let's say page with theme A and collapsible set with theme B you have to copy that piece of CSS and change -a to -b
[07:22:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we don't load the framework CSS in the unit tests, right?
[07:22:40] <uGoMobi> oh we do
[07:23:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Tell you what. I'll leave the relevant tests failing, and you can fix them right.
[07:23:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I fixed all the tests with wrong assumptions, but you can fix the ones which actually check for theme inheritance.
[07:23:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think tests will fail if you run it a second time because the :visited rule in our theme CSS
[07:23:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok cool
[07:24:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we better test with theme Z or something
[07:24:46] <uGoMobi> I will change that in checkboxradio
[07:27:00] <uGoMobi> ok I should have looked first... I also copied :visited rule to the index file so that's not going to be an issue

[09:36:42] <arschmitz> yup
[09:36:44] <toddmparker> but android is just slow
[09:36:56] <toddmparker> have you seen a fast slider on android?
[09:37:01] <toddmparker> non-native
[09:37:01] <arschmitz> yeah not really
[09:37:21] <arschmitz> im putting together some test pages with a couple dozen sliders on each using a few different sliders
[09:37:29] <arschmitz> seeing which seems to have the best performance
[09:37:55] <toddmparker> cool, great idea
[09:38:43] <arschmitz> yea we will see how that turns out and if it even is possible to have a good slider on android
