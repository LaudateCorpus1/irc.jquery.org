[03:28:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] exclude non-iOS platforms from this behavior - scottjehl
[03:28:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] preventFocusZoom default is true on iOS platforms, false otherwise, as it is only here to address an iOS bug. - scottjehl
[03:28:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] this dependency is already in the define statement, which should be enough - scottjehl

[06:13:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] this seems to be a little better on repaints. - scottjehl
[07:16:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/31Wo8Q
[07:16:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added updatePagePadding option to automate the use of the updatePagePadding method, with a default value of true. When true, this method calls the updatePagePadding method on webkitAnimationStart, animationstart, pageshow, and throttledresize. The animation events catch the page before it transitions in, whereas pageshow event serves the purpose of catching the page when animations are not in play, or when t
[08:17:53] <Wilto> I think a freenode server is on fire somewhere.
[08:49:55] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:06:29] <gseguin> toddparker: there has been no objection about the jquery version selector so I'm thinking of landing it for the rest of the code base
[09:59:41] <gseguin> johnbender: ping
[10:00:12] <johnbender> gseguin: ping
[10:00:15] <johnbender> gseguin: err pong
[10:00:24] <gseguin> oh so it's working
[10:00:32] <gseguin> good
[10:00:35] <johnbender> ?
[10:00:41] <gseguin> freenode
[10:00:51] <gseguin> I thought it was not working for some reason
[10:00:58] <gseguin> anyways...
[10:01:14] <gseguin> are our tests running?
[10:01:24] <johnbender> gseguin: they were when I checked yesterday why?
[10:01:24] <gseguin> are they green ?
[10:01:29] <johnbender> and they were green
[10:01:31] <gseguin> just wondering
[10:01:32] <johnbender> I can check again if you like
[10:01:40] <eddiemonge> johnbender: just pushed a fix to update cdn
[10:02:01] <johnbender> eddiemonge: cool, once we do this release I'm going to set up error handling
[10:02:42] <eddiemonge> i think the files are stall because they arent getting refreshed on the cdn
[10:05:38] <johnbender> eddiemonge: there's no docs.js in the mobile/latest/ on the cdn origin
[10:06:38] <eddiemonge> where is that supposed to be? which folder? gseguin thoughts?
[10:07:14] <gseguin> when you do "make docs" it'll create compiled/demos
[10:07:23] <gseguin> and it's under that dir
[10:08:11] <johnbender> yah demos is empty on the jsdir
[10:08:13] <toddparker> hey guys. just got back from my ,owning meetings
[10:08:20] <johnbender> err
[10:08:25] <johnbender> origin dir
[10:09:12] <eddiemonge> cdn/mobile/latest/demos ?
[10:10:04] <gseguin> correct
[10:11:28] <toddparker> thanks for looking at the test url guys
[10:11:49] <toddparker> johnbender: just checking on the new names for js and css files for 1.0.1. like htis:
[10:11:51] <toddparker> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0.1/jquery.mobile-1.0.1.min.js
[10:12:00] <toddparker> right?
[10:13:22] <johnbender> toddparker: I believe so yes
[10:16:59] <toddparker> seems so, just confirming. updating the docs in prep for 1.0.1
[10:17:05] <toddparker> int he 1.0-stable branch
[10:18:29] <johnbender> gseguin: eddiemonge: I'm unclear here
[10:18:41] <johnbender> the file jquery.mobile.docs.js is nested in demos/js
[10:18:53] <johnbender> but our cdn refresh, which worked as recently as yesteraday
[10:19:23] <johnbender> targets the js files two directories up in latest/
[10:20:48] <eddiemonge> im checking out the makefile
[10:31:13] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: do you guys or did you guys already have your call today?
[10:31:18] <johnbender> I don't recall what time it was
[10:31:48] <eddiemonge> ok i think i found the problem
[10:32:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ?
[10:32:26] <toddparker> johnbender: think it was at noon EST
[10:32:34] * gseguin catches up
[10:32:36] <johnbender> toddparker: yah that's what I thought
[10:32:46] <toddparker> but having you hop on for syncing would be good. i can try to join too
[10:32:54] <eddiemonge> testing now
[10:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: yes, it was at noon
[10:33:15] <toddparker> we'll try to be there next week scott_gonzalez
[10:33:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:33:30] <toddparker> anything we missed we should know?
[10:33:42] <johnbender> toddparker: yah It was suggested we do an infrastructure sync up with them but danheberden wanted to do a seperate call so that's still in a holding pattern
[10:33:44] <gseguin> johnbender: what's unclear?
[10:33:49] <Wilto> We’re switching UI and Mobile over to jQ.mobi, aren’t we?
[10:34:02] <johnbender> gseguin: we don't update the cdn properly with the curl
[10:34:05] <gseguin> Wilto: +1
[10:34:09] <toddparker> get outta here Wilto
[10:34:14] <toddparker> you too gseguin
[10:34:17] <Wilto> WHATEVER TODD IT’S THE FUTURE HERE TODAY
[10:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> Wilto: I thought we were just abandoning UI and Mobile since jQ.Mobi is so much smaller and faster
[10:34:26] <toddparker> it's be too awesome, we just can't do that
[10:34:27] <Wilto> So true. So, so true.
[10:34:49] <scott_gonzalez> Alternatively, we can just drop 90% of our API and level the playing field :-P
[10:34:55] <toddparker> everyone knows query core has 18 copies of the gettysberg address buried in the code to bloat it up good
[10:34:59] <toddparker> we like it that way
[10:35:13] <toddparker> 'cause we love america
[10:35:14] <johnbender> gseguin: the curl we do in the post commit hook on the website that does the build, pushes the files, and updates the cdn points at the latest/jquery.mobile.docs.js not latest/demos/js/jquery.mobile.docs.js
[10:35:26] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm just confused because that was working yesterday just fine
[10:36:05] <gseguin> johnbender: ok, let me know if I can help with that
[10:36:07] <danheberden> johnbender didn't eddiemonge make that? does it just need to be udpated to refresh the cdn?
[10:36:28] <johnbender> danheberden: I did update it, when we were having issues before
[10:36:50] <johnbender> danheberden: when I pestered you about why the curl wouldn't update and you pointed out I was using the wrong domain
[10:36:55] <johnbender> I added the curl to update the docs js
[10:37:03] <eddiemonge> johnbender: its a bit more complex
[10:37:19] <johnbender> danheberden: since you've come out into the open I'm going to snipe you
[10:37:23] <johnbender> danheberden: when can we do that meeting
[10:37:26] <gseguin> Wilto: I think we should steal some techniques from http://vaporjs.com/ in order to be able to compete wiht these guys
[10:37:50] <danheberden> johnbender there's some board stuff we need to settle via allocation of time and contracts before i can give you a good answer on that
[10:37:51] <danheberden> :(
[10:38:12] <eddiemonge> johnbender: the docs themselves also needed to be refreshed, i added that today
[10:38:23] <danheberden> and as of the last meeting, it was even more ambiguous
[10:39:04] <Wilto> gseguin: So efficient. It… it’s so beautiful…
[10:39:19] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: my new jquery replacement `window.jq.mobi.mini.micro = window.$ = document.querySelector;`
[10:39:37] <Wilto> ?CC
[10:39:38] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[10:41:12] <johnbender> danheberden: hmm, I have cycles to work on stuff but I guess determinig what that stuff is requires a lot of time from you guys
[10:42:36] <danheberden> johnbender that's been the whole problem - there's people willing to help, but enough complexity that we can't just 'jump in' - the original idea was to get some people to dedicate a big chunk of time to get the ball rolling and stuff setup
[10:43:05] <eddiemonge> gseguin: what folders are absolutely essential for docs? docs, js license, index.html ?
[10:43:13] <danheberden> and when we *did* have time, we didn't have servers
[10:43:18] <danheberden> OH THE INJUSTICE
[10:43:18] <johnbender> danheberden: do you want me to ask my boss if he's fine with a big chunk of time
[10:43:32] <johnbender> danheberden: that still requires input from you guys though
[10:43:58] * gseguin checks
[10:44:14] <danheberden> johnbender that would be neat for an open-ended question - like if you, corey and I could get some time to get through this stuff, that'd be bitchin
[10:44:35] <gseguin> eddiemonge: external
[10:44:44] <Wilto> danheberden: Just like that time you were the last person on Earth with so much time to read books, but your glasses broke.
[10:44:48] <gseguin> eddiemonge: css
[10:44:58] <danheberden> Wilto thank god i'm near sighted, right?
[10:45:11] <johnbender> danheberden: alright I'll ask, and let you know
[10:45:13] <Wilto> Anybody? Twilight Zone? Nothin’? Cool.
[10:45:28] <johnbender> danheberden: provided he  gives the thumbs up we'll need to sort out some high level stuff at least
[10:45:38] <danheberden> Wilto closest i got to that was 'eerie indiana'
[10:45:42] <toddparker> nice Wilto
[10:46:05] <toddparker> eddiemonge: we need the css folder too
[10:48:35] <johnbender> eddiemonge: gseguin: any chance you guys might want to go back to the original /test/ and just do the git checkout before the pull? :P
[10:49:09] <gseguin> I don't care
[10:49:17] <eddiemonge> for what end?
[10:49:23] <johnbender> how many files get picked up by the glob?
[10:49:48] <eddiemonge> all the ones in the docs folder but i guess i have to add in css, js and external
[10:50:09] <eddiemonge> when ideally those wouldnt be in the docs folder and the docs would reference the built versions
[10:50:14] <johnbender> is there a cost associated with refreshing the cdn?
[10:50:20] * johnbender has no knowledge of how a cdn works
[10:50:27] <johnbender> err
[10:50:33] <eddiemonge> about 4 minutes to push the propagation changes
[10:50:35] <danheberden> johnbender not really - edgecast manages their load of 'checking'
[10:50:37] * johnbender has no knowledge of the cost structure for a cdn
[10:50:58] <Wilto> Eight bucks? Nine?
[10:51:04] <toddparker> johnbender: on supported device list i added 4.0 like this:
[10:51:05] <toddparker> Android 4.0 (ICS)  - Since it's very new, we don't have a test phone in our lab but early reports are positive. Note: transitions can be poor on upgraded devices
[10:51:05] <Wilto> Per… per data.
[10:51:07] <johnbender> Wilto: bank == broken
[10:51:11] <Wilto> I hear that.
[10:51:18] <danheberden> "remember that one time johnbender bankrupted the jQuery project?"
[10:51:25] <johnbender> toddparker: yah I figured that it would be something like that
[10:51:33] <johnbender> toddparker: just wasn't sure
[10:51:43] <toddparker> yeah. i will need to be A
[10:51:48] <johnbender> toddparker: did you talk with Scott? I wasn't sure if he understood what was going on with the branches
[10:51:49] <toddparker> but it's early days
[10:52:02] <toddparker> i didn't get to this morning. meetings.
[10:52:16] <toddparker> i think what we said was cleaner, but we can follow up
[10:52:59] <toddparker> johnbender: i just pushed some small docs changes to the 1.0-stable branch in prep for the release
[10:53:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 4 new commits to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/srk-xg
[10:53:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Updated references from 1.0 to 1.0.1 - toddparker
[10:53:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Updated code examples on the anatomy of a page from 1.0 to 1.0.1 - toddparker
[10:53:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Updated version flag image to 1.0.1 - toddparker
[10:53:18] <toddparker> (1.0 >> 1.0.1 everywhere)
[10:53:53] <johnbender> toddparker: awesome
[10:53:54] <toddparker> last thing I'd like to do it a global to change the copyright from 2011 to "2011-12" or "2011-2012"
[10:54:14] <toddparker> change it both in the docs and js/css files
[10:54:25] <eddiemonge> why does docs/_assets/js/jqm-docs.js need to be amd-ized? thats docs specific and shouldnt be pulled into users projects
[10:54:26] <toddparker> any objections to me pushing that up
[10:55:07] <johnbender> toddparker: let me talk to my lawyer :D
[10:56:37] <Wilto> ?OBJECTION
[10:56:37] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/objection.jpg
[10:56:45] <Wilto> FINALLY I GET TO USE THAT.
[10:57:14] <Wilto> But no seriously go ahead.
[10:57:29] <gseguin> go ahead toddparker
[10:57:51] <gseguin> eddiemonge: using amd in our docs is a way of validating our modules
[10:58:41] <gseguin> also this way docs work in a dev set-up
[10:59:09] <eddiemonge> im talking specifically about this file/line: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/docs/_assets/js/jqm-docs.js#L3
[10:59:21] <eddiemonge> thats a pretty static page
[11:00:22] <gseguin> it's pulled in by: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.docs.js
[11:00:40] <gseguin> and docs point to that ^ file
[11:01:45] <gseguin> in other words before AMDification we were pulling jquery.mobile.js
[11:01:57] <gseguin> AND jquery.mobile.docs.js
[11:02:45] <gseguin> now, in the built docs we pull jquery.mobile.docs.js that contains both, in the right order
[11:04:48] <johnbender> danheberden: who do I talk to about access to the jenkins instance the jquerymobile.com server
[11:04:55] <johnbender> or rather the server that hosts jquerymobile.com
[11:04:59] <gseguin> I didn't get much feedback on jquery.tag.inserter
[11:05:06] <danheberden> johnbender i've added your key i'm pretty sure
[11:05:32] <gseguin> does anybody feel strongly opposed to using it accross the whole code base?
[11:05:35] <johnbender> danheberden: does that mean I can log into jenkins to add new buids?
[11:05:51] <danheberden> johnbender that's the actual box - jzaefferer setup jenkins i think?
[11:06:33] <johnbender> yah
[11:07:36] <johnbender> jzaefferer: any chance I can get access to jenkins
[11:07:50] <johnbender> jzaefferer: your input would be usefull here too
[11:08:29] <johnbender> I'd like to do our actual builds in jenkins
[11:08:44] <johnbender> or I'd at least like to examine the possibility
[11:10:16] <toddparker> hey all - since we're all here, can people weight in on gseguin's Q about using  jquery.tag.inserter on all the pages? See above
[11:10:40] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm against for the docs because it's confusing, but I thought everyone should weigh in
[11:11:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/aLeQkA
[11:11:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Changed copyright to "2011-2012" on all files. - toddparker
[11:11:48] <toddparker> here's my Q from before
[11:11:48] <Wilto> I could go either way.
[11:12:03] <Wilto> I mean, I can see the use for it, for certain.
[11:12:16] <toddparker> could we use the latest jQ core version hard-coded in the docs pages so master would have 1.7.1
[11:12:21] <toddparker> so it's simple
[11:12:29] <gseguin> it makes it really quick to test against any version of jquery
[11:12:48] <gseguin> it's already the case
[11:12:53] <toddparker> then have a script that replaces this with 1.6.4 and pushes that up as a branch preview
[11:12:58] <gseguin> it'll default to 1.7.1
[11:13:15] <gseguin> oh
[11:13:16] <gseguin> that
[11:13:20] <toddparker> right, but it's not just a simple js link in the head right? or at least it adds another js for switching?
[11:13:27] <gseguin> possible but needs work
[11:13:33] <johnbender> toddparker: we just have to keep that branch up to date with the latest
[11:13:45] <toddparker> because we only need to have an older version of jQ core for 2 purposes:
[11:13:50] <toddparker> unit tests
[11:14:00] <toddparker> and functional tests on real devices
[11:17:30] <johnbender> toddparker: our unit tests are covered
[11:24:49] <johnbender> eddiemonge: did you get the docs change sorted out?
[11:25:21] <eddiemonge> no. the way its now, its a bit complicated
[11:25:35] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'm going to move all that stuff over to the shell script I started on and add a check the version
[11:25:51] <johnbender> *add a check for the version of the js
[11:26:10] <eddiemonge> want to check the cdn to see if the change i made makes it up to date?
[11:26:23] <johnbender> eddiemonge: surely
[11:26:52] <gseguin> eddiemonge: not up to date
[11:27:22] <gseguin> curl -s http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/js/jquery.mobile.docs.js | head
[11:27:49] <eddiemonge> yeah i have to add in js and css and external to the script
[11:28:10] <eddiemonge> thats why id prefer if docs could ref the onces in /latest instead of /latest/demos/js etc
[11:28:16] <johnbender> eddiemonge: do you have time to address it or should I?
[11:29:28] <eddiemonge> i was trying to do it so we didnt need to have a list of the files that needed to be refreshed
[11:29:52] <johnbender> eddiemonge: doesn't that need to happen either way because of changes to the html if we use the cdn?
[11:30:02] <eddiemonge> but since those folders are built in to the make file i think its unavoidable unless we go back to the docs that referenced the built files
[11:30:05] <johnbender> I'm thinking we should stop using the cdn at this point because it's just a massive amount of complexity
[11:30:21] <eddiemonge> johnbender: its not the cdn its the new way the docs are built in the makefile
[11:31:00] <johnbender> eddiemonge: either way we have to update what's pushed to the site that's hosted on the cdn though right?
[11:31:12] <johnbender> meaning we have to glob all the files and do a curl
[11:31:23] <johnbender> as a total aside from the build docs
[11:31:28] <johnbender> *built
[11:32:37] <eddiemonge> right
[11:33:43] <johnbender> so prior to this the only problem we had to solve was that the file we referenced in the head of the docs html needed to be built
[11:33:51] <eddiemonge> oh wait, i got it. one minute
[11:33:55] <johnbender> now we have at least two problems
[11:34:16] <Wilto> Bringing my total to 99.
[11:34:26] <Wilto> (Someone drop a beat.)
[11:34:39] <Wilto> Showing myself out again.
[11:34:51] <danheberden> "you're going to hollywood baby!"
[11:34:55] <johnbender> now we have to build the docs, deploy them and the js to the cdn, and then make sure they are all up to date
[11:35:09] <johnbender> there's many many points of failure in there
[11:35:48] <danheberden> johnbender i think using the cdn to server that is a bit excessive, imho
[11:35:52] <danheberden> *to serve
[11:35:59] <danheberden> proper caching on that box should be more than enough
[11:37:51] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/ztIDNw
[11:37:51] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Updated code i getting started to 1.0.1 - toddparker
[11:38:23] <toddmparker_> hi
[11:38:32] <toddmparker_> web went out
[11:38:36] <toddmparker_> what did i miss?
[11:39:19] <gseguin> toddmparker_: Wilto has 99 problems
[11:39:34] <danheberden> and a bitch ain't one
[11:39:44] <gseguin> lol
[11:39:55] <johnbender> language!
[11:40:07] <Wilto> That pretty much brings you up to speed, toddmparker_.
[11:40:19] <toddmparker_> uh. gotta go.
[11:40:25] <Wilto> Problems 1–97 are the internet connection here.
[11:40:27] <eddiemonge> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3490
[11:40:28] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (5m, 41s ago): change to makefile for latest build
[11:40:29] <toddmparker_> right.
[11:40:32] <Wilto> Then there’s the two johnbender mentioned.
[11:40:46] <gseguin> I think I might have to work from home on my jQM days, i'm laughing to loud for the office
[11:40:50] <toddmparker_> ok, johnbender I think the 1.0-stable branch is good to go code-wise
[11:41:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright I have to eyeball that thing
[11:41:18] <toddmparker_> no joking around here fellas
[11:41:27] <toddmparker_> don't want milk to shoot out gseguin's
[11:41:30] <toddmparker_> nose
[11:41:34] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did you take a look at the branch preview version to see if all was well?
[11:41:42] <toddmparker_> lemme look
[11:43:06] <gseguin> PSA: 15 min to JSConf tickets sale opening
[11:43:22] <danheberden> ?os
[11:43:23] <bot-t> oh snao™
[11:43:30] <johnbender> ...
[11:43:32] <johnbender> snao
[11:44:06] <Wilto> wat
[11:44:30] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I might play around with switching back to the old way of viewing latest
[11:44:34] <toddmparker_> johnbender and eddiemonge - lastest preview is still out of date
[11:44:36] <toddmparker_> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/
[11:44:37] <johnbender> and just doign some simple swapping
[11:44:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah we're working on it
[11:44:47] <johnbender> eddiemonge: where is that redirect?
[11:44:47] <toddmparker_> oh, sorry
[11:44:54] <toddmparker_> what did you want me to look at then?
[11:45:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the branch preview for 1.0
[11:45:03] <johnbender> err
[11:45:05] <johnbender> 1.0-stable
[11:45:06] <eddiemonge> in the .conf in /srv/jquerymobile.com
[11:45:09] <johnbender> eddiemonge: cool
[11:45:10] <toddmparker_> ah, gotcha!
[11:45:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: wasn't sure if you checked that out
[11:45:26] <johnbender> I'm actually not sure those are working
[11:45:34] <johnbender> I haven't checked but the last I heard they were
[11:46:22] <toddmparker_> that has some earlier commits, but not the latest where I changed the copyright
[11:46:28] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/1.0-stable/index.html
[11:46:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright
[11:46:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we'll just have to trust that your local copy is sane
[11:46:56] <toddmparker_> looks like it updated maybe an hour ago
[11:46:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to figure out the latest issue
[11:46:59] <toddmparker_> heh
[11:47:16] <toddmparker_> and mat did a full test on all our devices yesterday on that branch
[11:47:23] <toddmparker_> blog post is written
[11:47:42] <toddmparker_> so we should just make sure everything is passing tests and i think we can go whenever we want
[11:47:45] <Wilto> SHIP IT
[11:47:53] <gseguin> ?shipit
[11:47:53] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/button.gif
[11:47:54] <toddmparker_> pretty small update
[11:48:11] <Wilto> I didn’t even know that was there. Man.
[11:48:14] <toddmparker_> that is so awesome
[11:49:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the branch preview is updated every hour
[11:49:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to deal with the latest stuff and then eyeball the deploy
[11:50:41] <johnbender> hopefully somewhere in there I'll get some lunch
[11:52:27] <toddmparker_> ok, sounds good on both counts johnbender
[11:52:33] <toddmparker_> no rush
[11:52:39] <toddmparker_> just saying that we're in good shape
[11:53:40] <gseguin> toddmparker_: anything you want me to look into or just go through issues?
[11:53:50] <toddmparker_> issues please
[11:53:57] <toddmparker_> i was just reding thru 1.0.1 issues
[11:54:08] <gseguin> I was going to tackle: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3479

[12:06:07] <eddiemonge> you could do that in init and rename init
[12:06:37] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ah, nevermind I'll just leave it
[12:09:40] <johnbender> hrm
[12:09:43] <johnbender> nevermind
[12:14:15] <toddmparker_> thanks gseguin

[12:15:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: hrm
[12:15:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that's probably low priority but that shouldn't be an issue :(
[12:15:46] <toddmparker_> ok, just wondering how important
[12:21:07] <eddiemonge> johnbender gseguin: you two have a pretty good handle on the build and server and stuff right?
[12:21:34] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yep, I'm on it
[12:21:55] <johnbender> eddiemonge: going to try switching back to the old way with something a bit ghetto but simple
[12:22:04] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'll let you know how it turns out
[12:22:26] <eddiemonge> if you got it then i think this might be my tentative resignation
[12:22:56] <johnbender> eddiemonge: :(
[12:25:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: Wilto: https://github.com/enyojs/enyo
[12:26:22] <toddmparker_> cool, cloning now...
[12:34:24] <toddmparker_> eh, that enyo stuff is all plumbing, no UI
[12:35:48] <Wilto> What is this business.
[12:41:40] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: you're really heading off into the sunset?
[12:42:10] <eddiemonge> ive been doing less and less and johnbender and gseguin have a better handle on things than i do anyway
[12:45:24] <toddmparker_> well, i've asked them to be the keepers of the whole build process
[12:45:33] <toddmparker_> definitely appreciate the work you've done for us
[12:45:42] <Wilto> You know you’ll be back, eddiemonge. No one can resist the siren song of Android bugs for very long.
[12:45:49] <toddmparker_> and welcome and contributions in the future
[12:45:59] <toddmparker_> :)
[12:46:01] <eddiemonge> with the exception of one android bug, ive stayed away from those
[12:46:12] <Wilto> A good move.
[12:46:18] <Wilto> That way surely lies madness.
[12:58:50] <gseguin> back, what did I miss
[12:58:52] <gseguin> ?
[13:00:09] <gseguin> holly what?
[13:00:40] <gseguin> sorry to see you go eddiemonge, thanks for everything
[13:04:44] <eddiemonge> thanks to you too
[13:04:48] <eddiemonge> i still owe you
[13:05:13] <gseguin> huh?
[13:06:50] <eddiemonge> for lucid
[13:08:51] <gseguin> oh, that, no worries man hope you're happy there
[13:09:23] <johnbender> eddiemonge: if I/we have questions is it ok to ping you?
[13:09:38] <johnbender> I'd hope you would still contrib to the project when you have time since you know the source pretty well
[13:09:50] <eddiemonge> johnbender: yeah of course
[13:28:32] <toddmparker_> we really do appreciate all the hard work you've done to date. thanks again eddiemonge
[13:29:33] <gseguin> Wilto: progress on the bundle builder?
[13:30:07] <gseguin> I'm going to break the API at some point, let me know when is a good time to do so
[13:30:33] <Wilto> Fallen by the wayside a bit, gseguin. You are free to break things.
[13:30:44] <gseguin> k
[13:30:57] <gseguin> it'll be easy to fix on your side
[13:33:43] <jzaefferer> hey guys - guess I need a better irc client, but… there was a highlight that I got notified about, but know nothing about the content?
[13:34:09] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[13:34:29] <jzaefferer> figures
[13:34:32] <jzaefferer> thanks gseguin
[13:35:28] <johnbender> jzaefferer: nothing to worry about now but I was thinking *IN THE FUTURE* we could do  our builds in jenkins
[13:35:34] <johnbender> built in error reporting
[13:35:37] <Wilto> IN THE WORLD OF TOMORROW
[13:37:23] <jzaefferer> johnbender: yeah, nightlies and shit
[13:37:38] <jzaefferer> but first, we need a shared home :-)
[13:37:45] <jzaefferer> any progress on that side?
[13:38:54] <johnbender> jzaefferer: you mean in moving our test runs over?
[13:39:04] <jzaefferer> that
[13:39:51] <johnbender> jzaefferer: nope, I'll see about that once we get 1.0.1 out
[13:40:16] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I will need access to jenkins for that though
[13:40:32] <johnbender> I have acccess to the server but I don't know how to add users save for the web interface
[13:40:39] <jzaefferer> johnbender: could've said that earlier, sounded like you got access already
[13:40:59] <jzaefferer> do a barrel roll! http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/signup
[13:41:02] <jzaefferer> I mean, sign up
[13:41:06] <jzaefferer> and gimme your username
[13:41:11] <jzaefferer> or just use "johnbender"
[13:41:50] <johnbender> did
[13:42:07] <johnbender> jzaefferer: johnbender it is
[13:43:39] <jzaefferer> johnbender: I maded you admin
[13:43:49] <johnbender> jzaefferer: thanks guy!
[13:43:51] <jzaefferer> for you may always be the only admin besides me :p
[13:43:56] * johnbender will assume that's a vote of confidence
[13:44:15] <johnbender> jzaefferer: cool, I'll talk with the team tommorrow about getting that moved over and priorities
[13:44:19] <johnbender> we have our meeting
[13:44:24] <johnbender> which you are of course always welcome to attend!
[13:48:49] <gseguin> jrburke: is there a way with requirejs to do deep interning of strings?
[13:49:32] * gseguin is not sure that even makes sense
[13:49:33] <jrburke> gseguin: how do you mean? if you use the text plugin, then it interns its values in a build.
[13:49:42] <gseguin> yeah
[13:49:56] <gseguin> where I would use that would be for the version string
[13:50:58] <jrburke> hmm, so the trick with that, it normally inlines the text plugin too. it might be a bit too much for a version string.
[13:51:33] <jrburke> you can exclude the text plugin, but it would take more work, and make the version string more indirect, nice to have it directly in there, particularly in a comment
[13:52:48] <gseguin> I wasn't thinking of comment but more a version API say $.mobile.version
[13:53:49] <gseguin> that works well in dev env using the text plugin but once built it doesn't work anymore since we get rid of the define
[13:54:20] <jrburke> ah right. yeah a post process regexp is probably better.
[13:54:46] <johnbender> gseguin: glad we can address that with the build
[13:54:57] <gseguin> yeah I was going to go that route next
[14:01:36] <jzaefferer> johnbender: usually the times don't work for me, we'll see
[14:01:59] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah I figured, but I want to make sure you know you're welcome
[14:02:20] <jzaefferer> cool
[14:04:10] <johnbender> gseguin: so my plan is to log the shit out of the stuff we're doing for latest
[14:04:14] <johnbender> and anything else I touch for that matter
[14:04:30] <johnbender> and then for now, when I record and error I might set up a cron to send out a quick email
[14:04:47] <johnbender> *record an
[14:06:13] <gseguin> yeah make sure we don't get flooded but that sounds fine
[14:19:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to monkey with /test/
[14:20:55] <toddmparker_> saw that, sounds good
[14:21:41] <toddmparker_> hey guys - i just created a new issue that i'd like to get into 1.1 (I know, I know johnbender)
[14:21:43] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3491
[14:21:44] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3491 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1m, 8s ago): Form element: Toolbar styling and general cleanup
[14:22:01] <toddmparker_> Wilto has been working ont hsi for the last few days we we've already made good progress
[14:22:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: hah, I'm that guy
[14:22:18] <toddmparker_> our forms are kind of messy
[14:22:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sorry for being such a hardass :P
[14:22:26] <toddmparker_> and totally busted in toolbars
[14:22:29] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/abadek/3
[14:22:37] <toddmparker_> that is all that needs to be said
[14:22:45] <toddmparker_> sort of embarrasing
[14:23:11] <toddmparker_> so i'd like to tidy this up for 1.1
[14:23:47] <toddmparker_> mostly just fixing up our styles. no new features really
[14:23:48] <johnbender> danheberden: jzaefferer: is there any reason I can't restart apache on the server that hosts jquerymobile.com
[14:24:23] <johnbender> as a side not there will be many of these annoying questions probably until I feel comfortable monkeying around on the servers
[14:25:46] <danheberden> johnbender is there nginx on that box?
[14:25:53] <johnbender> danheberden: looking
[14:26:02] <johnbender> danheberden: jquerymobile.com is hosted with apache
[14:26:12] <danheberden> i thought we have nginx as a proxy
[14:26:27] * danheberden could be wrong ofc
[14:26:35] <danheberden> ah, k, no nginx
[14:26:38] <johnbender> danheberden: nothing in `ps aux`
[14:26:58] <danheberden> johnbender what's the error yo're getting?
[14:27:01] <danheberden> with apache?
[14:27:07] <danheberden> configtest looks cool
[14:27:07] <johnbender> danheberden: not getting one
[14:27:23] <johnbender> danheberden: just wanted to restart after a config change to the local httpd.conf
[14:27:36] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/88cf4dd.png
[14:27:38] <danheberden> johnbender ^
[14:29:54] <danheberden> though a change to httpd.conf should only require `httpd reload`
[14:35:56] <Wilto> johnbender: As resident “that guy,” you provide a vital service to flaky designers like toddmparker_ and I.
[14:36:13] <toddmparker_> +1
[14:36:16] <Wilto> “LET’S MAKE EVERYTHING BLUE FOR ONE POINT ONE”
[14:36:47] <johnbender> Wilto: just make sure that if I get in the way you guys let me know
[14:36:54] <johnbender> I  don't want to be _THAT_ guy
[14:36:59] <Wilto> Hah, not at all, dude.
[14:37:26] <Wilto> But if a neckbeard should start growing in, we’ll alert you right away.
[14:44:28] <toddmparker_> he has a mental neckbeard
[14:44:49] <toddmparker_> wilto: on the topic of forms, this pull might be worth a look in your branch

[14:44:50] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by hpbuniat (1m, 1w ago): Slider: Support for a range-theme
[14:45:43] <Wilto> Oh, sweet.
[14:45:50] <Wilto> Since I’m in the neighborhood, yeah.
[14:46:53] <gseguin> I've got a solution for the version API
[14:47:06] <gseguin> anybody wants to vote on the name
[14:47:08] <gseguin> ?
[14:47:19] <gseguin> $.mobile.version
[14:47:23] <gseguin> being a string
[14:47:33] <johnbender> gseguin: core has a convention
[14:47:34] <toddmparker_> seems like a good name
[14:47:44] <johnbender> gseguin: $().jquery right?
[14:47:47] <Wilto> APPROVED
[14:48:02] <gseguin> yeah core does $.fn.jquery
[14:48:19] <johnbender> I did find that odd
[14:48:25] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, we should probably follow suit. Weird, though.
[14:48:25] <gseguin> indeed
[14:48:28] <johnbender> certainly seems like a job for a static method
[14:48:35] <johnbender> "static method"
[14:49:33] <gseguin> so you're saying: $.fn.mobile ?
[14:50:05] <gseguin> I wouldn't dare doing that
[14:50:23] <Wilto> Make it $.fn.jq.mobi, just to screw with them.
[14:50:41] <gseguin> DONE!
[14:50:44] <jzaefferer> hey guys, maybe jQuery UI isa good reference?
[14:51:04] <jzaefferer> $.fn.version is pretty ambigious, so $.fn.jquery makes sense
[14:51:07] <gseguin> ha jzaefferer, the voice of reason
[14:51:09] <jzaefferer> but $.mobile?
[14:51:13] <jzaefferer> or $.ui?
[14:51:18] <jzaefferer> a lil' less
[14:51:22] <jzaefferer> so .version works fine
[14:51:33] <jzaefferer> and consistent with UI
[14:51:47] <gseguin> so $.mobile.version, right?
[14:51:59] <gseguin> yeah I'm all for consistency in the API
[14:52:35] <jzaefferer> UI also has the version property on the prototypes
[14:52:35] <Wilto> I DON’T LIKE CONSISTENCY
[14:52:42] <jzaefferer> like $.ui.autocomplete.prototype.version
[14:52:49] <johnbender> I think we should add an attrbute to String `mobile` so we can to $.fn.jquery.mobile
[14:52:56] * johnbender is joking
[14:53:37] <gseguin> Wilto: I propose we put our version string in $
[14:53:40] <Wilto> $.mobile.wilto is probably off the table, huh?
[14:53:44] <Wilto> I like it, gseguin.
[14:54:06] <johnbender> gseguin: $.mobile.version
[14:54:15] <johnbender> I agree
[14:54:15] <Wilto> Yeah, seconded.
[14:54:21] <gseguin> alright, going once
[14:54:26] * johnbender notes that was his original suggestion
[14:54:29] <johnbender> jzaefferer: any opposition
[14:54:36] <Wilto> DAMMIT, BENDER
[14:54:37] <johnbender> that seems the most sane option to me
[14:54:47] <johnbender> sorry
[14:54:56] <johnbender> that was gseguin's original suggestion not mine
[14:55:03] <johnbender> my emote was ambiguous

[14:55:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] remove redundant compile output cleaning - John Bender
[14:57:27] <jzaefferer> johnbender: what happens to that when you include an individual mobile component?
[14:57:56] <johnbender> jzaefferer: not sure what you mean, in case someone creates a "version" widget?
[14:58:13] <johnbender> or how are we managing widget versions within the library
[14:58:30] <gseguin> brb
[15:03:47] <jzaefferer> johnbender: what if all I want is buttonMarkup?
[15:04:07] <jzaefferer> guess that still requires core which defines $.mobile.version
[15:04:28] <johnbender> jzaefferer: ahh, that's a smart question though
[15:04:36] <johnbender> yah I think we're fine there
[15:04:59] <johnbender> so long as all builds include core
[15:06:40] <jzaefferer> right
[15:06:41] <jzaefferer> so, go
[15:07:03] <jzaefferer> mhm, looking at the first sample here: http://enyojs.com/ thinking, yeah, document.write was cool, let's build on that model!

[15:31:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah
[15:31:39] <gseguin> later
[15:35:35] <johnbender> gseguin: does text.js mean anything to you
[15:35:45] <johnbender> gseguin: the build is vommiting on the server
[15:35:46] <gseguin> oh man
[15:35:55] <gseguin> sorry about that

[16:10:54] <johnbender> gseguin: alright logging sorted
[16:11:03] <gseguin> good
[16:11:12] <johnbender> gseguin: if there's ever a problem the output from the build is logged in the mobile error log
[16:11:25] <johnbender> so anyone with access can get you information
[16:11:39] <gseguin> who is "anyone with access" ?
[16:11:52] <johnbender> gseguin: danheberden gnarf jzaefferer
[16:11:55] <johnbender> so far as I know
[16:12:01] <johnbender> gseguin: and eddie
[16:12:10] <johnbender> unless they pull his key off the server
[16:12:28] <johnbender> gseguin: also I just did the ghetto thing
[16:12:52] <johnbender> gseguin: cp the compiled js/jquery.mobile.docs.js and then git checkout before the pull
[16:12:56] <johnbender> works fine
[16:13:06] <johnbender> it's logged all over the place
[16:13:14] <johnbender> so hopefully it'll be easier to address issues
[16:14:06] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/blob/master/bin/deploy-latest.sh
[16:14:29] <johnbender> at the end it checks that it's the compiled version
[16:14:39] <johnbender> I still need to account for the case where the pull fails
[16:15:49] <gseguin> johnbender: why don't you point demos at compiled/demos ?
[16:16:15] <gseguin> because the way you do it is going to need maintenance if we change something
[16:16:29] <gseguin> and it does not take care of the css, does it?
[16:16:50] <johnbender> gseguin: not sure what you mean
[16:17:39] <gseguin> so from what I see /test is basically going to pick up the index.html at the root of our repo, right?
[16:19:09] <johnbender> yerp
[16:19:55] <gseguin> yeah so what I'm suggesting is that instead we make /test point at compiled/demos
[16:20:19] <gseguin> this way there is less file copying around to do, just a call to make
[16:20:31] <johnbender> gseguin: is there anything else involved there?
[16:20:53] <gseguin> yes the CSS @import resolution
[16:21:41] <johnbender> gseguin: what are we not doing the current way? Just the css as a single file?
[16:22:34] <gseguin> in the script you just sent me you don't copy the built css files
[16:22:44] <johnbender> gseguin: yep
[16:22:50] <johnbender> gseguin: so it loads as imports right?
[16:22:55] <gseguin> correct
[16:23:41] <gseguin> what I'm saying is that if you start copying files it's going to make it less easy to maintain
[16:23:59] <gseguin> instead of just invoking one make target
[16:25:12] <johnbender> gseguin: I'd like to find a better way than copying the file
[16:25:26] <johnbender> but pointing at the compile output has it's own issues, least of which is that we remove the output before we create it
[16:25:32] <gseguin> point /test at compiled/demos
[16:25:56] <johnbender> we could copy it to an untracked folder I guess
[16:25:57] <gseguin> sorry I pressed enter too late
[16:26:30] <gseguin> that's very easy to change
[16:28:40] <johnbender> gseguin: "__version__" undefined
[16:29:12] <gseguin> that would be me
[16:29:22] <gseguin> where do you see that error?
[16:30:09] <johnbender> jquerymobile.com/test/
[16:32:19] <johnbender> gseguin: did we completely remove java from the Makefile?
[16:32:36] <johnbender> for building the js that is?
[16:32:44] <gseguin> oh crap
[16:32:55] <gseguin> man! this is my screw up day
[16:33:03] <gseguin> I locally use node
[16:33:15] <gseguin> and I checked in my makefile
[16:33:20] <gseguin> let me revert that
[16:33:25] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[16:34:44] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm going to add the cp for the css for now
[16:35:00] <gseguin> oh
[16:35:08] <gseguin> and I know why you got that error
[16:35:15] <gseguin> fixing it right NAO
[16:35:24] <johnbender> gseguin: did that sneak in with the Makefile addition?
[16:35:32] <johnbender> that's what I was thinking from my git log -p
[16:35:49] <gseguin> no, it's because I didn't do the same exclude in the docs target
[16:38:50] <johnbender> gseguin: did you push the makefile fix yet?
[16:39:12] <gseguin> just did
[16:39:19] <gseguin> but there is another one coming
[16:39:23] <gseguin> let me test it
[16:39:30] <johnbender> kk
[16:39:34] <johnbender> just testing the cp

[16:46:06] <johnbender> gseguin: that seems to be the theme with the build :D
[16:46:12] <johnbender> maybe just with /latest
[16:46:14] <johnbender> lol
[16:46:20] <gseguin> :)
[16:46:53] <johnbender> gseguin: let me know when you push your change

[16:47:02] <johnbender> and the /test ain't workin :(
[16:47:15] <gseguin> will do shortly
[16:50:25] <johnbender> gseguin: alright I'm packingup I'll check it again when I get home

[21:11:02] <gseguin> jrburke: yeah! I don't even know why these were there
[21:11:23] <gseguin> I removed them and it was working in both dev and built so..
[21:12:08] <jrburke> cool! i almost removed them in my pull request, but was not sure i could adequately test them. very cool
[21:12:37] <gseguin> that means that our dependencies are almost sorted out
