[07:19:11] <frequent> hi there
[07:19:21] <frequent> I'm having "sticky buttons" today =
[07:19:26] <uGoMobi> frequent: that was with opening popups as far as i know
[07:19:34] <frequent> closing dialog, will re-trigger whichever button I clicked last
[07:20:07] <uGoMobi> frequent: do you have a test page somewhere
[07:20:08] <uGoMobi> ?

[08:23:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: scottjehl__ I think the build is broken
[08:23:59] <bot-t> (23 hours 30 mins ago) <gseguin> tell johnbender: We should delete the "1.2" branch
[08:24:00] <bot-t> (23 hours 4 mins ago) <ryanneufeld> tell johnbender: any idea why vagrant strips the domain from the hostname when using conifg.vm.host_name ?
[08:24:08] <johnbender> from one the transition fixes that went in
[08:24:12] <johnbender> had to do with tool bars
[08:24:22] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: that question still stands
[08:24:37] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: no
[08:24:40] <johnbender> might be a bug
[08:24:44] <ryanneufeld> feck
[08:24:45] <ryanneufeld> thx
[08:24:53] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I would stop off in #vagrant and ask
[08:24:58] <johnbender> otherwise I can take a look later
[08:25:59] <johnbender> arschmitz: you around?

[08:26:42] <johnbender> one of those two is failing one of our fixed-toolbar tests
[08:27:24] <johnbender> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/775/console
[08:27:30] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[08:27:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[08:29:46] <gseguin> johnbender: looking
[08:43:12] <johnbender> gseguin: sorry for the late heads up I was completely useless yesterday
[08:43:21] <johnbender> food poisoning
[08:45:35] <johnbender> gseguin: if you see scottjehl__ I'm curious if the base tag test got it
[08:45:38] <johnbender> *got in
[08:45:55] <johnbender> I'd like to merge the base tag branch
[09:16:47] <gseguin> johnbender: do you have a link to your jQM intro preso?
[09:45:24] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm yah but I think it's fairly out of date/crapy

[10:11:47] <gnarf> johnbender: hey did you see my question RE that demos repo?
[10:29:43] <johnbender> gnarf: nope
[10:32:03] <gnarf> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile-demos - Do we still need this / do we want it private?
[10:32:51] <johnbender> gnarf: it's still necessary, though we haven't changed any of it in a long time
[10:33:05] <johnbender> gnarf: we can make it private if we want but it's not important
[10:33:08] <gnarf> private on purpose?
[10:33:11] <gnarf> it is private
[10:33:17] <johnbender> gnarf: so
[10:33:18] <gnarf> i was just wondering if it should be
[10:33:27] <gnarf> or if we needed it
[10:33:34] <gnarf> cuz it was getting kinda stale
[10:33:44] <johnbender> gnarf: it's the "extra" site stuff crammed in under the wordpress install
[10:33:58] <gnarf> no issue with it staying that way, but it didn't seem to need to be private for any reason
[10:34:17] <johnbender> gnarf: well it was private because we were checking a shared secret on git hooks
[10:34:25] <gnarf> ahh
[10:34:50] <johnbender> gnarf: I can probably go in there and take that stuff out if you're looking to free up a "private slot"
[10:35:02] <johnbender> but I'm not sure I'll get everything
[10:35:11] <johnbender> that is I'm worried there are things that shouldn't be public in there
[10:38:26] <gnarf> johnbender: no prob
[10:38:38] <gnarf> johnbender: I just had this "this might could be public" feeling when I saw it
[10:38:44] <gnarf> we aren't low on privates or anything
[10:39:05] <johnbender> gnarf: ok
[10:39:13] <johnbender> gnarf: sorry for cluttering up the repos :(
[10:39:43] <gnarf> don't be
