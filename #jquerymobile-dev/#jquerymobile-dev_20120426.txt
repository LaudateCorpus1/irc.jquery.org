[00:33:32] <r3dsm0k3> Hello all
[00:33:42] <r3dsm0k3> I've got a problem
[00:33:57] <r3dsm0k3> Im developing a site where there are 2 select boxes.
[00:34:09] <r3dsm0k3> depending on the selection on the first one ,i have to fetch the data for the next one.
[00:34:12] <r3dsm0k3> with ajax
[00:34:26] <r3dsm0k3> my problem here is I'm not able to bind the first select box to change event
[00:35:24] <r3dsm0k3> basically user navigates to this page and do the selection,If the user is navigating from the index page and coming to this page it is not working.but,.if I'm reloading the page (no pages before the page where i makes the selection) it works.
[00:35:36] <r3dsm0k3> Do i have to do something else to get this working?

[07:26:26] <Wilto> There is no joy in Boston this morning, gentlemen.
[07:50:28] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: By all means, do share with the group ...
[07:51:13] <Wilto> Oh, just the Bruins.
[07:59:39] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! Winnipeg?! Man ... I've been too busy with my new baby daughter ...
[08:00:03] * _|Nix|_ is checking the conference standings - waaay too late to the game :)
[08:00:49] <_|Nix|_> Bah ... my team didn't even make the playoffs *wave* ...
[08:02:35] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Don't feel too bad - I was in Calgary the year they made it to the final ... that was a stab to the heart ...
[08:03:38] * _|Nix|_ lights a candle at the altar of unfulfilled dreams and forgotten glory
[08:39:18] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:50:15] <Wilto> Sup, gseguin.

[09:31:28] <gnarf> hrm
[09:31:32] <gnarf> no expect in that unit?
[09:32:06] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ^
[09:33:02] <gnarf> also, looking at the actual code, it seems to me now that dialog( "close" ) x 2 would still have the same problem?
[09:33:15] <gnarf> or however you programmatically call it
[09:33:59] <gnarf> self.close() should probably be aware of its "closing" status rather than the click handler
[09:34:32] <gseguin> gnarf: coul you comment on the commit as _|Nix|_ doesn't seem to be here?
[09:34:56] <gseguin> s/coul/could
[09:34:56] <gnarf> gseguin: which one, master, 1.1-stable, or something else? :)
[09:35:36] <gseguin> I guess master is fine, he'll apply whatever change to 1.1-stable as well
[09:35:47] <gseguin> thank you
[09:37:56] <johnbender> gseguin: yah but shouldn't the commiters be doing that?
[09:38:11] <johnbender> I gues I'd prefer that you ping them to make sure they do it :/
[09:38:43] <gseguin> it's doc stuff mostly
[09:39:15] <gseguin> when I do a log --grep I find that very few made it to 1.1-stable
[09:39:59] <gseguin> johnbender: I'll realign and then will ask commiters to do it from now on
[09:42:31] <johnbender> gseguin: cool thanks
[09:42:38] <johnbender> just want to get people in the habbit

[09:53:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] [popup] Prevent double-click from closing the popup twice - Gabriel Schulhof
[09:53:50] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Looking now ...
[09:55:16] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: what was happening there, its hard to tell by the unit
[09:55:21] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Good point about the handler ...
[09:55:42] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Look at issue #3387
[09:56:20] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Double-clicking on the 'Close' button caused two calls to window.history.back() instead of just one.
[09:56:50] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: But, I guess you're right - the close method should handle that.
[09:56:59] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: I just found the same problem in popup-widget.
[09:57:16] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: double-clicking on the screen behind the popup widget would go back twice.
[09:57:40] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: np - hate to see those handlers bloat up when it feels like the job of a close() function to know if it already "closed"  :)
[09:58:02] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Yeah ... I
[09:58:06] <_|Nix|_> ll have another look ...
[09:58:14] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: thx ;)
[09:58:51] <_|Nix|_> popup widget has a self._isOpen flag, but it was being updated late, so sometimes a double-open or a double-close was able to slip in.

[11:01:28] <toddparker> thanks gseguin
[11:28:38] <tbenzige> i can't get in. can someone add me to the hangout?
[11:29:08] <gseguin> tbenzige: invited
[11:29:40] <tbenzige> gseguin: thanks
[11:30:47] <tbenzige> it says the hangout is jam packed. wont let me in
[11:31:06] <gseguin> darn, we've hit the limit ?
[11:31:36] <tbenzige> i guess… http://awes0.me/jam_packed.png
[11:32:45] <tbenzige> oh well… not a lot new going on with TR. tell toddparker to ping me later if he has questions
[11:59:12] <johnbender> toddparker: kinblas: I'm dropping off to meet a friend for lunch
[11:59:23] <johnbender> let me know if there's anything super pressin
[12:04:47] <kinblas> gseguin: tbenzige: so is there a hangout limit you specify when you create a hangout?
[12:12:16] <kinblas> toddparker: thinking about the vclick thing a bit ... if we did a preventDefault() on vmousedown ... that would prevent touch devices from generating any mouse events
[12:12:47] <kinblas> toddparker: that also means they couldn't scroll when clicking on a collapsible header.
[12:14:01] <gnarf> hangout has a soft limit of like 13 people
[12:14:02] <gnarf> kinblas:
[12:14:14] <gnarf> it just wont let you go over whatever its limit is
[12:14:55] <gnarf> It's also a processor hog that makes my machine almost useless, and its near impossible for me to talk because I'll sound like a robot due to bad sampling due to overworked processor :)
[12:41:25] <gseguin> kinblas: nothing I could specify
[12:41:39] <gseguin> kinblas: I think it's just the default limit
[12:42:20] <gseguin> gnarf: ping
[12:45:34] <gnarf> gseguin: sup
[12:45:57] <gseguin> hey so, regarding machine that we need for jqm
[12:46:42] <gseguin> right now we have a node service running on a no.de joyent machine for the download builder backend
[12:47:37] <gseguin> that I was asked to move into the jQuery infra
[12:47:50] <gnarf> gseguin: so have you seen https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/jQuery-Server-Architecture ?
[12:48:14] * gseguin looks
[12:48:35] <gnarf> gseguin: the general plan is to have two frontend nginx cache proxies
[12:48:52] <gnarf> then two machines behind that, one that runs all the wordpresses, and one that runs everything else
[12:49:25] <gnarf> that will be where most of our download builders, etc run
[12:49:53] <gseguin> oh ok, so on that one I'll set up my node service
[12:50:14] <gseguin> what's the ETA for that and what's required from me?
[12:50:28] <gnarf> gseguin: more likely, we will setup puppet to clone your repo, a post-commit hook to keep it up to date, and whatever nginx configs
[12:51:24] <gnarf> gseguin: I'm probably going to start a staging environment for the node/builders machine soon
[12:51:40] <gseguin> gnarf: why not a bare git repo with a post_receive that deploys? a-la no.de ?
[12:52:25] <gnarf> gseguin: re the post-commit?
[12:52:32] <gseguin> this way you can do push to github without necessarily triggering an update
[12:52:44] <gnarf> how do you trigger an update?
[12:52:58] <gnarf> also - you want all pushes to your "master" to trigger staging to update
[12:53:01] <gseguin> by pushing to that repo specifically
[12:53:10] <gnarf> but only symvers
[12:54:01] <gseguin> oh so you'll have master deployed to staging
[12:54:05] <gnarf> yup
[12:54:15] <gnarf> then any version tags get deployed to live
[12:54:20] <gseguin> and a specific branch being deployed to prod
[12:54:25] <gseguin> oh tag
[12:54:28] <gnarf> (or a branch)
[12:54:32] <gnarf> depending on the repo
[12:54:37] <gnarf> hasn't really been solidified
[12:54:47] <gnarf> but either shouldn't be too hard
[12:54:53] <gseguin> ok, I guess that works as well
[12:55:24] <gseguin> cool, well let me know when I can do what
[12:55:27] <gnarf> gseguin: seems easier than having to deal with access control for git repos on a server
[12:55:57] <gseguin> yeah true, this way access control is done through github mainly
[12:56:07] <gnarf> gseguin: exactly
[12:56:21] <gseguin> makes sense
[12:56:34] <gnarf> gseguin: do you already have a repo for the download builder somewhere, and any docs on getting it up and running?
[12:57:02] <gseguin> docs? hrrmm... not my forte :(
[12:57:17] <gnarf> gseguin: well, I have to be able to automate the install of this thing
[12:57:18] <gseguin> but it's pretty simple
[12:57:21] <gnarf> :)
[12:57:26] <gseguin> yeah yeah
[12:57:37] <gnarf> so if you can get me step by step instructions, I can write a puppet module for it
[12:57:53] * gseguin retrieves the repo
[12:58:14] <gseguin> https://github.com/gseguin/node-amd-builder
[12:58:32] <gnarf> although right now prolly not the best time for me to dig in, so if you could - start up an issue about it on jquery/infrastructure (you do have access there right?)
[12:59:05] * gseguin checks
[12:59:45] <gseguin> yes
