[06:55:09] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: gseguin: uGoMobi:
[06:58:22] <uGoMobi> morning  guys
[07:46:08] <_|Nix|_> OK, WTF?! npm is hanging on npm install ... In particular, it hangs at or after https://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-qunit-junit
[07:47:31] <_|Nix|_> ... and it dies after a while ...
[07:47:59] <arschmitz> hmm...
[07:48:32] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... async and grunt-qunit-junit return 304 ...
[07:49:44] <_|Nix|_> What in the blazes?!
[07:50:10] <_|Nix|_> OK, now it's grinding on, but it's extreeeeemly slow ...
[07:50:26] <arschmitz> npm servers having trouble maybe
[07:50:33] <_|Nix|_> NM. It died ...
[07:51:49] <_|Nix|_> Either that or it's my ISP ... no idea ... of course, my connection to freenode seems to be OK ...
[07:51:51] <arschmitz> ill try it
[07:52:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's like it's timing out, and npm isn't handling it very gracefully.
[07:53:31] <arschmitz> fun im doing a clone right now and will try npm in a min when its done
[07:53:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NP.
[07:57:13] <arschmitz> im getting a whole pile of 304's 
[07:57:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... mine is advancing ... slowly ...
[07:57:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No 304s yet ...
[07:57:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's a redirect though, so it should be followed ..
[07:58:08] <arschmitz> yeah mine is working 
[07:58:16] <arschmitz> its not failing on them
[08:01:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Now, so seems to be mine, although it's still fetching packages. So, it's slooooooow ...
[08:01:47] <arschmitz> its a little slow but it seems to be working fine 
[08:02:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's taking me at least an order of magnitude longer to fetch the packages ... dare I say two ... ?
[08:02:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: mine is slower then normal but i wouldnt say anything close to that
[08:03:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, mine is /still/ fetching packages ...
[08:03:10] <arschmitz> and mine is only slow on the 304 ones those take noticbly longer
[08:03:24] <arschmitz> mine too but i think i started well after you
[08:03:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The funny thing is, I'm not getting any 304s.
[08:03:47] <arschmitz> weird iv got dozens
[08:03:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Must be the CDN.
[08:04:13] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:04:32] <arschmitz> the 304's are the only thing being slow for me those can take up to like 30sec each it seems
[08:06:25] <_|Nix|_> OK, I also got a 304. That was a death knell the previous 3 times. Lessee this time.
[08:06:25] <arschmitz> wooooo..... lots of 500's now
[08:06:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Me too ...
[08:07:03] <_|Nix|_> error parsing json ...
[08:07:08] <arschmitz> yup!
[08:07:33] <_|Nix|_> Great ... I picked the perfect time to run cd jqm; npm cache clean && npm install && grunt from grunt.
[08:08:16] <arschmitz> yeah i would say npm is having some real issues at the moment
[08:08:23] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[08:08:45] <arschmitz> after a few dozen 500's it seems to be back on track
[08:08:56] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[08:09:06] <_|Nix|_> They probably have an extensive set of mirrors.
[08:09:27] <_|Nix|_> But d000d, I've never spent a quarter hour doing npm install ...
[08:09:36] <arschmitz> nope
[08:09:51] <arschmitz> oh finished with a big ol failure
[08:10:50] <_|Nix|_> Nice ... mine is running ... make? O_o ... the things you see when it's slow :)
[08:12:32] <_|Nix|_> Oh, wait ... I'm nowhere near phantomjs yet ... that's something it still has to d/l.
[08:12:47] <_|Nix|_> It's incredible how many packages are needed to build jqm.
[08:13:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah mine failed and im rerunning and it seems to be getting all the error ones ok this time
[08:13:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, at least it doesn't re-fetch.
[08:14:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Big ol' failure you said? I see it O_o
[08:15:18] <arschmitz> oh finished with packages and installing phantom
[08:15:20] <arschmitz> nice
[08:16:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. It finally worked!
[08:20:59] <_|Nix|_> ... aaaand, like an idiot, I git clean -x -d -f -f
[08:21:08] <_|Nix|_> ... though now it seems to be faster.
[08:21:22] <arschmitz> yeah i think they are working on / fixed the issue
[08:26:47] <_|Nix|_> OK ... why is it that, when I run npm install a second time, it still finds packages it needs.
[08:26:50] <_|Nix|_> ?
[08:27:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: god its rediculas how dependant i am on github for everything i do
[08:27:24] <arschmitz> hmm yeah i just tried that 
[08:27:46] <arschmitz> finds async and grunt-contrib-qunit-junit 
[08:27:58] <arschmitz> execpt not contrib lol
[08:28:26] <arschmitz> if github ever when down for a substantial amount of time id be in trouble lol
[08:28:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why? You have the repo locally.
[08:28:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, sure, the issues and such would be gone ...
[08:29:10] <arschmitz> yeah but i use CI with post commit hooks for all updates
[08:29:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... which leads me to conclude that perhaps we should develop an arch where the issues are part of the repo.
[08:30:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I belive git has annotations for stuff ... 
[08:30:07] <arschmitz> yeah losing all the wiki and issues would be HORRIBLE
[08:30:15] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[08:30:18] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ...
[08:30:22] <_|Nix|_> intriguing ...
[08:30:37] <arschmitz> generally i dont worry about github they seem pretty secure and stable but you never know
[08:30:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course.
[08:31:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You could start an orphan branch within the repo that has all the issues ...
[08:31:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but you still need a Web front end for issue reporters, because they shouldn't have commit access to the repo - not even the orphan branch :)
[08:32:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i wouldnt worry about a front end really
[08:32:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No? github is a front end.
[08:32:22] <arschmitz> its more of an incase shit thing 
[08:32:33] <arschmitz> so IF something actually happened then build a front end
[08:32:52] <arschmitz> since the likelyhood of needing it is pretty small
[08:33:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, if issues were submitted as pull requests to this orphaned branch then we would have a backup in case github went down.
[08:34:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OPs could just email us with a git-formatted patch which we would commit to the orphan branch.
[08:34:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then, make the fix on master/whatever, and make a second commit to the orphan branch, marking the issue as resolved.
[08:34:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: github could implement this, and, if they ever went down, we'd be on our own, but with our issues intact.
[08:36:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course, since git is fully distributed, we as committers would have to keep each other fairly tightly in the loop about issues that arise. Otherwise we'll be merging the issues branch :)
[08:36:18] <arschmitz> ha ha
[08:36:23] <arschmitz> that would not be good
[08:36:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This is actually not bad. If you think about it, both core and UI use trac and not GH.
[08:36:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... so we could use a third solution.
[08:37:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... one that does not require a Web front end per se.
[08:37:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i think thats more for historical reasons then anything else though
[08:37:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Still. Something to think about.
[08:37:36] <arschmitz> and i think it would be much more confusing for people trying to submit issues
[08:37:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Currently, all issue reporting fails to take advantage of git's distributed nature.
[08:38:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It would be transparent to them - until GH went down.
[08:38:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then, in the ensuing chaos, they would be pleasantly surprised to learn that their issues are intact and that, furthermore, they can ccontinue to submit issues, albeit less conveniently.
[08:38:55] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:39:19] <arschmitz> as a backup i think it would be good if we could make it all work
[08:39:23] <_|Nix|_> But anyway ... I need to look after my daughter while my wife makes dinner.
[08:39:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Indeed ... BBIAB.
[08:39:39] <arschmitz> have a good one
[08:39:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks!

[11:19:16] <jlembeck> Anybody see this?
[11:19:34] <johnbender> jlembeck: yep
[11:19:40] <jlembeck> that's fantastic.
[11:19:47] <johnbender> jlembeck: I was involved in an early conversation about just that thing
[11:20:00] <johnbender> jlembeck: they excluded me subsequently though lol
[11:20:05] <jlembeck> Ha, should've figured so, Adobe and all
[11:20:09] * johnbender tends to share his opinions too freely
[11:20:24] <johnbender> jlembeck: perfect kind of thing to get involved with
[11:20:31] <johnbender> (for the company)
[11:20:37] <johnbender> from my perspective at least
[11:20:53] <jlembeck> any negatives in the jQM area that you can see?
[11:21:05] <johnbender> jlembeck: nope it's just css
[11:21:14] <johnbender> would be nice to interoperate for a demo or something
[11:21:19] <johnbender> maybe I'll do that after 1.4
[11:21:44] <johnbender> toddmparker: that's actually an interesting idea
[11:21:54] <jlembeck> yeah, interested in it from the perf test perspective, for certain. Wondering how we could fold it in.
[11:21:56] <johnbender> toddmparker: a flag to turn off css
[11:22:40] <johnbender> topcoat related 
[11:23:07] <johnbender> jlembeck: I'd like to get some performance tests set up period before doing anything else
[11:23:14] <johnbender> eg, integrating with browserscope
[11:23:34] <johnbender> we talk a lot about performance but we haven't actually done anything concrete with the two different things we've built so far
[11:23:45] <johnbender> so once that happens we should invest more time imo
[11:23:54] <johnbender> core is doing some things too
[11:24:08] <johnbender> don't let that stop you from scratching your own itch though
[11:24:10] <johnbender> :)
[11:25:52] <jlembeck> Oh, for certain. I am trying to get it set up for FG internals riiiiiiight now.
[11:29:53] <jlembeck> after that, will report back on how easy it looks for jqm
[11:38:08] <toddmparker> would this help to benchmark the css/markup improvements from 1.3 to 1.4?
[13:26:35] <uGoMobi> everyone is on vacation after Portland conf.. me too BTW :)
[13:40:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm taking mine a bit later - after midsummer (=== 2013-06-24 ->)
[13:40:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice!
[13:47:05] <agcolom> Hi All, yes, I'll be in Portland! (and hopefully picking up my new passport tomorrow!)
[13:47:48] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I got lucky. Mine expires 6 months and 6 days after the conference :)
[13:48:31] <agcolom> well very lucky I found out about that rule! I was going with a passport expiring 3 weeks after the conference!
[13:48:57] <agcolom> and was told by French Consulate I would not have been able to come back!
[13:49:19] <agcolom> (only went because my kids ID card expires in July!)
[13:50:04] <agcolom> V
[13:50:17] <agcolom> please ignore this ^ 
[13:50:28] <_|Nix|_> \/
[13:50:53] * _|Nix|_ is bored
[13:51:26] * agcolom has back pain again! Hence the crazy keystrokes!
[13:51:39] <_|Nix|_> Sorry to hear that.
[13:51:46] <_|Nix|_> I recently had a good experience.
[13:51:55] <_|Nix|_> I learned that a fit-ball can help with backpain.
[13:52:03] <agcolom> It's not as bad as it was last year...
[13:52:47] <agcolom> The problem with me is then the lack of sleep... I can't take the full dose of prescribed drugs because they give me hallucinations!
[13:52:50] <_|Nix|_> I lay down on it on my stomach, knees on the floor, and hands hanging over my head. Then I relaxed, and my lower back started hurting like crazy - but it was the good kind of pain.
[13:52:59] <_|Nix|_> I felt it stretching.
[13:53:20] <_|Nix|_> Ouch!
[13:53:21] <agcolom> I was told also that that was a good exercise!
[13:53:33] <agcolom> I need to go swimming!
[13:53:50] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Oh, it's awesome! Of course, not as good as swimming.
[13:54:27] <agcolom> but I'll take it easy until it gets better first :-)
[13:54:45] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Swimming is pretty much out of the question for us. Neither of us wants to go alone, and if we went the three of us, my daughter would never let either one of us go swim alone :)
[13:55:03] <agcolom> how old is she now?
[13:55:38] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: 2 years and 2.5 months.
[13:55:55] <agcolom> oh, that's still young! Yes. 
[13:56:28] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I dunno ... by the time she gets to the point where one of us is enough for her, we'll both be cripples :)
