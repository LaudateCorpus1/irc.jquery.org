[03:41:52] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Old build #58: NOW UNSTABLE in 1 hr 18 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/58/
[06:34:58] <agcolom> gseguin, toddmparker, uGoMobi, johnbender: Hi, the button widget, is it button or buttonMarkup?  Thank you (for the API docs).
[08:12:15] <arschmitz> agcolom: we change time next weekend here ( they changed it a few years ago )
[08:13:00] <agcolom> arschmitz: thank you!
[08:26:53] <agcolom> Hey JasonDScott !
[08:57:00] <JasonDScott_> Hi agcolom
[09:28:17] <agcolom> Hi JasonDScott or is it JasonDScott_ ? Looks like I may have missed you again....
[10:19:21] <gseguin> agcolom: In the US it's the first Sunday in November that we switch back to Standard time
[11:25:25] <agcolom> gseguin: Thanks. That means I may not be back on time on Thursday (6pm instead of 7pm) for our meeting... I'll try...
[14:58:56] <johnbender> agcolom: I'm not 100% sure on the button docs issue
[14:59:01] <johnbender> in an ideal world it would be the widget
[15:00:31] <agcolom> johnbender: hi! it's when I looked here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/button.js
[15:01:30] <johnbender> agcolom: I think the old docs my have referrences to the buttonMarkup method though
[15:01:35] <johnbender> let me check
[15:01:44] <agcolom> lines 36 and 69 say buttonMarkup....
[15:01:55] <agcolom> would seem to be inline with the options...
[15:02:26] <johnbender> agcolom: it looks like buttonMarkup is documented
[15:02:34] <agcolom> yes
[15:02:36] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-options.html
[15:02:36] <johnbender> agcolom: docs/buttons/options
[15:02:39] <johnbender> yar
[15:02:42] <johnbender> :(
[15:03:01] <agcolom> so should I use buttonMarkup as the name of hte widget?
[15:03:29] <johnbender> agcolom: well it's not a widget
[15:03:35] <johnbender> its just a jquery method
[15:04:25] <agcolom> ok... I'm getting confused... because the api docs now have something to create examples directly... and it uses the name of the widget to create the getter and setter examples for the options...
[15:04:55] <agcolom> and if I use button, the examples are incorrect and do not work... so I thought maybe I should use buttonMarkup...
[15:05:47] <johnbender> agcolom: ugh
[15:06:00] <johnbender> agcolom: yah button markup should be rolled into button
[15:06:25] <johnbender> agcolom: maybe we should seriously consider deprecating button markup and just set up the button widget to accept the options as a passthrough
[15:08:13] <agcolom> maybe something to be discussed... I don't want to make you change your plans or what you've done...
[15:10:44] <agcolom> So to recap, the name of the widget is button but the jquery method used to make changes to it is buttonMarkup?
[20:22:15] <johnbender> agcolom: well it's something we've known for a while - the buttonMarkup thing should be a widget
