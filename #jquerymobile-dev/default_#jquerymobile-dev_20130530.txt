[04:32:38] <agcolom> Hi _|Nix|_ I seem to remember that you had an example of sliders to change the colors of something... Do you still have that somewhere?
[05:26:06] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi: _|Nix|_:
[05:55:53] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: http://web-ui-fw.go-nix.ca:8081/hsvpicker/
[05:57:20] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: And https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw/tree/jqm/js/widgets/color/hsvpicker.js
[05:57:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:58:01] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Ping!
[05:58:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hey
[05:58:14] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: pong
[05:58:19] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I'm trying to deploy api.jquerymobile.com onto a VM I created on the local machine.
[05:58:39] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:58:45] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Everything works fine, except categories/widgets/ gives me a 404, and so does pretty much every link off the main page.
[05:59:04] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Do you know what I'm missing?
[05:59:14] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: grunt deploy works fine to the wordpress instance.
[05:59:32] <scott_gonzalez> Is this is a fresh install of jquery-wp-content?
[05:59:36] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah.
[06:00:06] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: If I go to /wp-admin and log in, it tells me that I have the requisite number of posts and categories and everything.
[06:00:11] <scott_gonzalez> Log in to WordPress (add /wp-admin/ afte the domain).
[06:00:43] <scott_gonzalez> In the sidebar, click Settings -> Permalinks
[06:01:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Jussec ... it's pretty slow ...
[06:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> When it loads, let me know which radio is checked.
[06:02:33] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: "Post name"
[06:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, now try loading /categories/widgets/ again.
[06:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> See if it magically works.
[06:03:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK.
[06:03:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Nope :(
[06:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[06:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> So you're not running into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/44
[06:04:37] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I don't believe so, unless simply visiting the page doesn't fix it for me.
[06:04:47] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Is there a place in the DB where I can make sure that setting is applied?
[06:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if all of the settisgs are stored in the database.
[06:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> Some of them we just override in code.
[06:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> Are you using apache or nginx?
[06:06:03] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: apache.
[06:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> Did you copy the .htaccess?
[06:06:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I did.
[06:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> And just because I've seen this happen before, is it named properly?
[06:07:06] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: However, this is not a NameVirtualHost setup, because wordpress is the only site running there.
[06:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> So you're not accessing it as x.api.jquerymobile.com?
[06:07:44] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: It is, but I can su -l httpd and try to cat it.
[06:07:57] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yes, I am. I am accessing it as local.api.jquerymobile.com
[06:08:00] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:08:07] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I have edited /etc/hosts to point that to the right IP.
[06:08:23] <scott_gonzalez> Right, ok.
[06:09:08] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I can check to see that the httpd user has access to the file.
[06:09:14] <scott_gonzalez> And you have AllowOverride turned on?
[06:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> Wait, which kind of 404 are you getting?
[06:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> Apache 404 or WordPress page not found?
[06:09:52] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Apache 404
[06:10:08] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Lemme see about AllowOverride. That may be it.
[06:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so this is probably an .htaccess problem.
[06:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> I can't count the number of times I've tried to use .htaccess without turning on AllowOverride :-/
[06:11:23] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Lemme see.
[06:12:14] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Argh ... each directory has its own AllowOverride ...
[06:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[06:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> Just rip them all out and set AllowOverride All for /
[06:13:08] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[06:14:35] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That was it. I actually found the right one to change from None to All. Thanks a lot!
[06:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[06:16:01] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Thank you! Sorry had to go to a meeting@
[06:16:50] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The documentation on jquery-wp-content's GH page contains AllowOverride, but only for the NameVirtualHost case. Maybe you should append that to warn about the main-site case as well, because in that case the <VirtualHost> entry will not be used.
[06:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: I don't think we cover mention anywhere how to not use a virtual host.
[06:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> And we do that for a reason.
[06:21:06] <_|Nix|_> I guess I'd normally use that setup as well. It was only in this case that I made an exception, since this was a VM dedicated to this job.
[06:21:26] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Good to know though!
[06:22:00] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: I can't seem to be able to access the 1st link :-( (http://web-ui-fw.go-nix.ca:8081/hsvpicker/)
[06:22:23] <agcolom> BTW I am in total AGONY!!!!! 
[06:24:02] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Sorry to hear that!
[06:24:32] <agcolom> Thanks! I was not too bad yesterday but today is really bad! Hope the meds work soon!
[06:27:00] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Weird ... that link works from my phone, which uses an independent connection. Maybe you're getting firewalled because you're not connecting to a usual port (80), but instead, you're connecting to 8081 *shrug*
[06:27:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you access http://web-ui-fw.go-nix.ca:8081/hsvpicker/
[06:27:32] <agcolom> yes, it's probably that. it says it takes too long to respond
[06:27:59] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Well, it /is/ a slow computer, but it's not that slow :)
[06:28:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[06:28:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... well, I dunno where else I can post that ... 
[06:29:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it was pretty slow though
[06:30:02] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Can you refresh and try again? If it's /that/ slow, it might well be that it timed out.
[06:35:08] <agcolom> tried... same thing :-(
[06:36:14] <agcolom> I'll keep on trying... Maybe it will work from home, I'll try when I get back... Thanks :-)
[06:38:57] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK. Just out of curiosity: What device are you trying from? Is it a phone? A tablet? A laptop?
[06:39:27] <_|Nix|_> That just goes to prove that I /really/ need to find some hosting for web-ui-fw.go-nix.ca
[08:17:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[08:22:39] <toddmparker> agcolom: sorry to hear you're in so much pain. Have you tried acupuncture?
[08:23:01] <toddmparker> exercise does help quite a bit once you back up and on the move
[08:28:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/812/edit
[08:31:05] <toddmparker> arschmitz: looks good!
[08:31:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: actually look at 13 sorry
[08:31:20] <toddmparker> so with this approach, you wouldn't be able to drag anymore, that right?
[08:31:24] <toddmparker> ok
[08:31:36] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yes thats right no more drag
[08:31:46] <arschmitz> its a huge performance issue just to make it fancy
[08:32:02] <toddmparker> yeah, agreed
[08:32:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thats using next
[08:32:25] <toddmparker> the one thing we need to a mange is that this uses a checkbox instead of a select
[08:32:41] <arschmitz> yea i was just thinking about that
[08:32:44] <toddmparker> so we'd either need to deprecate for 1.4 and wait
[08:32:52] <toddmparker> or build a backcompat thing
[08:33:15] <arschmitz> i was thinking have both ways for 1.4 but depreciate slider based one
[08:33:20] <arschmitz> and remove in 1.5
[08:33:42] <arschmitz> so then we can rewrite slider for 1.5 also
[08:34:30] <arschmitz> toddmparker: this is even fully compatible with ie8
[08:34:38] <toddmparker> yep, agree
[08:34:41] <toddmparker> nice!
[08:34:44] <arschmitz> just no animation of  course
[08:35:25] <arschmitz> the js is almost non existant which is nice
[08:35:32] <arschmitz> just adding a div
[08:35:37] <arschmitz> and toggleing a class
[08:39:26] <toddmparker> yeah, it's a lot simpler
[08:39:29] <toddmparker> which is great
[08:40:01] <arschmitz> im going to turn it into a widget now that im happy with the function 
[08:40:11] <arschmitz> then get with uGoMobi to polish the style
[08:59:45] <toddmparker> sounds like a good plan
[10:09:20] <didiergm> arschmitz, toddmparker sorry to chime in - if I may replacing a select with a checkbox will have a possibly non trivial side effect and unless I am mistaken - checkboxes when unchecked are not part of a form whilst select always are as they always have a value. so not only the front end will have to change but possibly the back end too.  
[10:10:12] <didiergm> so serialize() will never give the same result. apart from the fact that the values can be chosen with a select, not really with a checkbox.
[10:39:00] <toddmparker> didiergm: gotcha
[10:39:32] <toddmparker> we'll discuss that
[10:40:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker: there are other issues with checkbox i thought of 
[10:40:36] <arschmitz> im going to make it work with select or check i think
[10:42:08] <arschmitz> didiergm: this is not meant to be a direct replacement for the current flip switch its a new widget though for unrelated reasons im now going to make it work with selects as well
[10:42:31] <toddmparker> would radios be a better approach?
[10:42:44] <toddmparker> tho if none is checked by default...
[10:43:12] <toddmparker> checks don't have that odd state to deal with
[10:43:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: the issue with checkbox is the text
[10:43:21] <arschmitz> right now you can set it by setting it on each select
[10:43:26] <toddmparker> right
[10:43:40] <arschmitz> the approach with the checkboxes im using only allows on or off so thats not going to work i dont think
[10:43:53] <toddmparker> semantics are add for a check - how to label both states?
[10:44:13] <toddmparker> radios at least offer two things to label
[10:44:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[10:44:37] <arschmitz> it would be pretty simple to make it work with all 3
[10:45:32] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker i cant join todays meeting 
[10:45:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker: the only thing that would be different with the 3 is where to get the labels and what to do to update the input
[10:45:52] <agcolom> Good evening all :-) Finally made it home! 
[10:45:57] <arschmitz> but those are really simple things in all cases 
[10:46:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: figured you must be either sick or busy today havent seen you around all day
[10:46:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: thats very unuasual for you
[10:46:55] <uGoMobi_> I am on a boat
[10:47:02] <arschmitz> event better
[10:47:03] <arschmitz> !
[10:47:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: enjoy!
[10:47:31] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: I can access your server from home. I must have been blocked by the university server
[10:50:09] <jzaefferer> arschmitz toddmparker: fyi the Jenkins server move is progressing (yay). Once that is somewhat complete, I'd like to pair with someone on the mobile team to review what's going with testing here. For example, `grunt test` should run fast to be useful, currently its really slow. That might also help with improving the Jenkins jobs.
[10:50:43] <toddmparker> jzaefferer: awesome.
[10:50:45] <jzaefferer> There's also questionable things happening like the branch preview taking up several GB of space on disk, or one of the jobs running for days
[10:50:50] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: awesome happy to help in any way i can
[10:51:19] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: so I could get on Skype (or whatever) with you to review things? then figure out where to start improving them?
[10:51:27] <toddmparker> that sounds questionable for sure
[10:51:40] <jzaefferer> I don't like the idea of some Jenkins job going rogue, then not knowing who to ask about that
[10:51:46] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah whatever works for you just give me a time and ill make myself available
[10:55:50] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Cool!
[10:56:05] <agcolom> toddmparker: thanks :-) I'm on anti-inflamatory (I just can't cope with the crazy painkillers they gave me... far too strong for me ;-) ) Hopefully be ok in a few days and I really have to be careful carrying heavy stuff! 
[10:57:07] <agcolom> Then I need to go swimming every week :-)
[10:58:32] <_|Nix|_> Are we meeting tonight?
[11:00:04] <johnbender> same question here
[11:00:10] <johnbender> toddmparker: ping
[11:04:26] <toddmparker> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AvPfBzAiS8Hmiy3Il0I0xWa-0IEjmG4RedDKA3b8Bh8/edit#
[11:04:29] <toddmparker> we are, sorry
[12:44:06] <uGoMobi_> I forgot to mention that i did triage yesterday and removed mileatones from tickets so we have a workable amount of tickets for 1.3.2 and 1.4. 
[12:44:55] <uGoMobi_> Was thinking maybe we should move new filter widget ext to 1.5  too
[12:45:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: yeah i think frequent has been busy 
[12:45:22] <uGoMobi_> If we want to release alpha at end of next month
[12:46:14] <uGoMobi_> Yeah
[12:46:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: i think your right i dont think any of us will have time to get to it
[12:46:43] <arschmitz> if frequent shows back up and has time great if not its good for 1.5
[12:46:57] <uGoMobi_> Review all curent widgeta will take a lot of time
[12:47:06] <uGoMobi_> Okay sounds good
[12:47:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: exactly
[15:11:31] <toddmparker> sounds like a good plan, all
[16:37:20] <jlang1> Is there a more appropriate IRC channel than this one to possibly get some help with a jquery mobile problem I am having? 
[16:43:35] <nschonni> jlang1: the jquery channels that don't have a "-dev" in the name
[16:47:38] <jlang1> There isn't jquery mobile specific channel besides this one is there ?
[20:06:42] <DaReaper5> can anyone here help me with an input ordering issue
[20:08:01] <DaReaper5> i want to have a label after a checkbox. But I would like the label to nicely append to it (like other checkboxes would in a controlgroup)
[20:08:19] <DaReaper5> i know how to do this in bootstrap but can this be done in jqm?
