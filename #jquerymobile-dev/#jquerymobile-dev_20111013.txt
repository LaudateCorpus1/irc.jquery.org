[07:04:51] <toddparker> hi all
[07:18:46] <Wilto> Whatup.
[10:29:09] <toddparker> kin
[10:29:12] <toddparker> kinblas:
[10:29:25] <kinblas> toddparker: yo
[10:29:30] <toddparker> i'm making some dumb pages to let us test some global config options
[10:29:35] <toddparker> tacky, but hey
[10:29:45] <toddparker> anyway, can you test something for me?
[10:29:46] <kinblas> ??
[10:29:50] <kinblas> sho-thing
[10:29:58] <kinblas> url?
[10:29:59] <toddparker> soooo
[10:30:09] <toddparker> $.mobile.defaultPageTransition = 'fade'
[10:30:12] <toddparker> doesn't seem to work
[10:30:18] <toddparker> the dialog transition setting works
[10:30:23] <toddparker> am i doing something wrong?
[10:30:29] <toddparker> jet need another set of eyes
[10:30:43] <kinblas> toddparker: wasn't that how you guys were getting the fade effect on the docs?
[10:30:50] * kinblas tries it out
[10:36:23] <toddparker> nevermind, found the issue
[10:36:40] <toddparker> the docs.js was overriding the page transition
[10:36:45] <toddparker> based on screen side
[10:36:48] <toddparker> size
[10:36:53] <toddparker> and that was after my customization
[10:37:01] <toddparker> overriding my override
[10:37:11] <toddparker> kinblas: all set
[10:37:21] <toddparker> these test page will come in handy methinks
[10:38:25] <kinblas> toddparker: it does work
[10:38:45] <kinblas> toddparker: grrr, working on mac is slowing me down :-)
[10:39:09] <kinblas> toddparker: so what is this page thing?
[10:39:45] <toddparker> easier to show than tell
[10:40:03] <toddparker> just a want o quickly turn on touch overflow, change transitions, etc.
[10:40:08] <toddparker> just for testing
[10:40:23] <kinblas> toddparker: ah yes, we had Tyler build something like that
[10:40:30] <toddparker> yeah?!?!?!?
[10:40:33] <kinblas> the problem was that some of the options aren't dynamically read
[10:40:39] <toddparker> ah, right
[10:40:43] <toddparker> i'm old skool
[10:40:46] <kinblas> so most of them didn't work
[10:40:51] <toddparker> a list view that links to pages
[10:41:02] <toddparker> each link has a ajax=false
[10:41:02] <kinblas> toddparker: so what we do have is something we can load on any platform
[10:41:07] <toddparker> so it reloads the next page
[10:41:08] <kinblas> and it can tell us what the support values are
[10:41:17] <kinblas> and settings are
[10:41:17] <toddparker> each page has a little config block
[10:41:24] <toddparker> and a link to browse the docs
[10:41:39] <toddparker> so i basically reload a page to force these settings to take effect
[10:41:45] <toddparker> then you can browse around
[10:41:57] <toddparker> if you hit a del=external or other refresh event, game over
[10:42:05] <toddparker> but it's fine for quick and dirty
[10:42:32] <kinblas> sounds cool, can we see it?
[10:43:33] <toddparker> gonna check it in in a few
[10:43:43] <toddparker> we can look at it oont he call
[10:45:40] <kinblas> toddparker: are we doing the skype/irc thing today?
[10:45:47] <toddparker> think so
[10:45:53] <toddparker> i liked that better, you?
[10:46:18] <kinblas> yeah things go faster
[10:46:27] <kinblas> but it's bad for folks on irc
[10:46:28] <kinblas> :-)
[10:49:28] <toddparker> i know, but if we try to add notes as we go, it's fine
[10:49:33] <toddparker> more productive for us
[10:59:51] <toddparker> kinblas, johnbender, wilto
[10:59:59] <toddparker> meeting starting in a minute
[11:00:04] <toddparker> i'll dial you on Skype too
[11:00:38] <Wilto> Ditto.
[11:02:39] <eddiemonge> can i listen in?

[11:18:06] <jqm-jenkins-bot> todd: Created a set of static global config test pages
[11:58:42] <snover> gentlemen
[12:00:42] <kinblas> johnbender: you guys still talking on skype? My machine seems to have frozen up
[12:00:47] <kinblas> I thought you guys were silent
[12:01:02] <snover> questions?
[12:02:00] <eddiemonge> best way to handle dependancy management in jqm
[12:02:21] <eddiemonge> in order to build a download builder
[12:02:50] <eddiemonge> best way to handle dependancy management in jqm in order to build a download builder
[12:02:51] <kinblas> snover: johnbender had heard core was doing a similar AMD exercise for 1.8, we were wanting to follow what you folks are doing
[12:03:33] <snover> OK, so, there are a couple of different parts to this
[12:04:17] <snover> To clarify, you are trying to create a package manager, right?
[12:04:40] <kinblas> snover: yes
[12:09:33] <snover> So yeah, I dunno, I mean, there are only so many ways to skin that particular cat. You look up the package manifest, read its dependency list, check against the local package registry for packages that are already installed, then do that recursively for each dependent package until you have positively resolved all dependencies, then install all of them
[12:11:48] <snover> At the moment, there is no established standard for the registry/repository formats, but there is a CommonJS standard for package manifests. If you use that, then other package managers (like cpm) will be able to consume jQuery packages.
[12:11:55] <snover> and vice-versa
[12:12:50] <snover> And continuing along those lines, if the contents of those modules are required to be in AMD format, then they will be interoperable with other module loaders (like RequireJS, Dojo Loader, some other AMD loaders that exist now)
[12:13:41] <snover> The issue of the *content* of the packages is entirely orthogonal to the issue of what package manifests look like
[12:13:45] <snover> Is that at all useful?
[12:14:59] <snover> I mean, honestly, cpm is licensed under the same terms as the Dojo Toolkit so you could probably just go ahead and use that and avoid all the heartache of having to build something from scratch. But it is usually good to have more than one implementation, since that’s how cool features are introduced and spec bugs are found.
[12:15:46] <ajpiano> johnbender: we are also working on creating a packages and dep mgmt system for jquery plugins
[12:15:55] <ajpiano> we should all probably coalesce around that a bit
[12:16:20] <ajpiano> cc kinblas
[12:17:29] <snover> Anyway, I’ll idle in here for a bit, ping me with questions !
[12:34:43] <toddparker> i think johnbender hopped on a call, but thanks for helping out snover and ajpiano - i'm sure he'll ping you soon
[12:35:15] <ajpiano> ok
[12:35:53] <ajpiano> i'm very much open to having a final "jquery plugins spec tweak session" with people who have done plugins stuff and jqm
[12:36:11] <ajpiano> and see if there's any changes that we'd want to make before we finally make a bleedin' frontend for it

[13:26:48] <eddiemonge> johnbender: so no question then?
[13:48:33] <toddparker> johnbender and kinblas - thoughts on this pull?
[13:48:34] <toddparker> https://github.com/redaemn/jquery-mobile/commit/1559478aae179850bb40c6da7a224407cec2f9d3
[13:48:34] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by redaemn (26m, 47s ago): Issue #2654 - 'degradeInputs' plugin doesn't trigger on 'create' events; modified plugin and added tests
[13:50:17] <snover> OK guys, if you don’t have anything for me right now I’m gonna head out and ajpiano or Wilto or someone can come find me again if you do
[13:50:42] <ajpiano> i'll be sure to annoy you at the right moment
[13:51:01] <snover> perfect.
[13:51:06] <snover> bye!
[13:56:00] <kinblas> toddparker: the fix itself ehance -> create is good
[14:06:26] <toddparker> so should i pull it in?
[14:06:29] <toddparker> or did you?
[14:07:09] <toddparker> actually that guy added a comment to his code:
[14:07:10] <toddparker> I'm not sure whether this is right or not... maybe I should get the options from the "page object" with
[14:07:10] <toddparker> $(e.target).closest(':jqmData(role="page")).data("page")
[14:07:10] <toddparker> Any suggestion?!?
[14:18:03] <johnbender> eddiemonge: nope!
[14:18:07] <johnbender> toddparker: looking
[14:19:51] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #125: SUCCESS in 12 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/125/
[14:19:51] <jqm-jenkins-bot> mat: Fixes position of ‘current version’ flag on documentation index when touchOverflowEnabled is true.
[14:23:12] <johnbender> toddparker: that's wrong we need it from the page instance because those options can be overidden by data attributes
[14:23:19] <kinblas> toddparker: I added a comment
[14:23:20] <johnbender> commented
[14:23:26] <kinblas> toddparker: we want the first change but not the 2nd
[14:23:34] <johnbender> I got it first!
[14:23:39] <johnbender> kinblas: >:]
[14:23:42] <johnbender> lol
[14:23:49] <kinblas> johnbender: damn
[14:23:51] <johnbender> hahaha
[14:24:02] <kinblas> only because I rewrote my paragraph 3 times
[14:24:03] <kinblas> :-P
[14:24:21] <johnbender> the key is to go back and edit many times
[14:24:22] <johnbender> lol
[14:24:34] <johnbender> I can't remember when I've ever gotten a comment right the first time
[14:24:42] <johnbender> I'm still considering the tests
[14:24:45] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[14:26:09] <johnbender> also there's a bug there, where we need to reference the keepNativeSelector() method
[14:26:19] <johnbender> I should have told you guys about that during the meeting
[14:41:56] <kinblas> toddparker: johnbender: I think I'm going to modify the fixed header/footer code so that it only toggles visibility if you tap something that is *NOT* a form element or link ... any objections?
[14:43:09] <johnbender> kinblas: does that matter for custom selects? Or are the tap events always on the button div?
[14:43:43] <johnbender> I'm making the assumption that you're toggling visibility because the page has changed and it has to reset the header/footer
[14:44:14] <kinblas> johnbender: there's a feature we have for fixed header/footers ... such that, if you tap it toggles the visibility
[14:44:25] <johnbender> the footer itself?
[14:44:30] <kinblas> unfortunately, this happens when you tap on a collapsible
[14:44:39] <kinblas> or a link, or a listview item
[14:44:43] <kinblas> etc
[14:44:57] <kinblas> or a button
[14:45:02] <johnbender> alright
[14:45:09] <johnbender> clearly I'm not well enough informed to participate
[14:45:14] <kinblas> tapping on a header/footer itself does not toggle
[14:45:15] <johnbender> I'll defer
[14:45:21] <kinblas> it has to be in the space between the header/footer
[14:47:31] <johnbender> kinblas: so are you just talking about the elements you won't watch for the visibility toggle?
[14:48:06] <johnbender> anything that's not a form element or link you're going to toggle on to be safe
[14:48:28] <kinblas> johnbender: today if a click propagates up to the document, we do the toggle
[14:48:54] <kinblas> I'm talking about adding some code that says, only toggle if the target was not inside a link or form element
[14:51:09] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm going to take a look a the code but go for it
[14:51:15] <johnbender> I'll educate myself asynchronously
[15:03:58] <kinblas> johnbender: heh, it's already in there, but it isn't working right for some reason.
[15:04:01] * kinblas investigates
[15:13:12] <johnbender> toddparker: I commented a ton on that pull request
[15:13:16] <johnbender> we'll see what he comes back with

[15:31:03] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by johnbender (2m, 57s ago): create separate structure and structure.min cssThis addition is in response to the creation of the theme roller. It doesn't make much sense to include a theme from the framework if the user is adding his/her own from the theme roller or otherwise.
[15:31:12] <johnbender> see anything super bad with my additions
[15:31:24] <johnbender> there's a fair amount of repetition in there but it's still pretty simple
[15:31:35] <eddiemonge> looking
[15:33:14] <eddiemonge> is the tr going to completely replace the theme file?
[15:34:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: there wouldn't be much point in removing the theme file otherwise
[15:34:30] <eddiemonge> does cat file1 file2 >> output work? if not, new line 104 will fail
[15:34:30] <johnbender> but we should ask todd
[15:34:51] <johnbender> eddiemonge: it works
[15:34:52] <eddiemonge> actually 104 and 105 are awkward
[15:35:07] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'm just following the convention
[15:35:40] <johnbender> that is the convention established in the file
[15:36:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: why are they awkward?
[15:37:26] <johnbender> one thing I just noticed
[15:37:33] <johnbender> the version isn't dumped into the structure
[15:38:20] <johnbender> toddparker: themeroller will produce a whole theme file correct
[15:38:21] <johnbender> ?
[15:38:43] <johnbender> toddparker: see Eddie's question above "is the tr goign to completely replace the theme file?"
[15:40:42] <eddiemonge> actually, im a bit confused what the changes are for
[15:41:11] <johnbender> eddiemonge: we want to provide *just* the structure for people who are going to use theme roller generated css
[15:41:23] <johnbender> doesn't make much sense to include the default theme if you've got another one
[15:41:26] <johnbender> wire weight
[15:41:58] <eddiemonge> then perhaps we should rearrange the css folder? like move all the structure stuff out of default?
[15:42:41] <johnbender> eddiemonge: that would save us the trouble of having to explicitly define the files thats for sure
[15:42:59] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'm going to merge this in if you have no objections thus far and we can itterate if you want
[15:43:09] <johnbender> it's only additive at this point
[15:43:11] <eddiemonge> i do have one change
[15:43:41] <eddiemonge> @@head -8 js/jquery.mobile.core.js | ${SED_VER} > ${OUTPUT}/${CSSSTRUCTURE}
[15:43:47] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah I've got that in now
[15:43:49] <johnbender> just about to push
[15:43:50] <eddiemonge> add in before line 104
[15:44:06] <johnbender> "the version isn't dumped into the structure
[15:44:09] <johnbender> from above
[15:45:50] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ok it's in master
[16:05:12] <eddiemonge> ok so rearranging the css folder is a bit of work

[17:52:57] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'll defer to toddparker on the arrangement the css organization is his baby
[17:53:02] <johnbender> eddiemonge: but I like the idea
[17:53:20] <johnbender> can't we just do a glob for the core css files if they are in their own folder?
[17:53:41] <eddiemonge> do they need to be in a specific order? if not then yes we can
[17:54:56] <johnbender> eddiemonge: oooh fine point sir
[17:55:25] <johnbender> I imagine we'll have to ask toddparker or possible toddmparker_
[17:55:29] <johnbender> one of those two
[17:55:34] <johnbender> or maybe even scottjehl
[17:55:46] <eddiemonge> yeah. its a huge change
[17:56:10] <johnbender> eddiemonge: good on you for doing it though
[17:56:32] <eddiemonge> i also made changes to the build.xml file
[17:56:51] <eddiemonge> even if my change doesnt land, it should be updated as well with the make file changes
[18:15:31] <johnbender> eddiemonge: can we pull that out into a seperate commit then?

[18:16:25] <johnbender> separate*
[18:16:31] <johnbender> you are right though
[18:17:13] <eddiemonge> well that specific change is dependant on the whole changeset
