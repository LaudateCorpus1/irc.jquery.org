[01:21:26] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi opened issue #5969: DEMOS: 404 ERRORS AND BROKEN IMAGES  02http://git.io/hIv0Ug
[01:24:53] <agcolom> Hey Jasper! 
[01:25:18] <agcolom> Thanks for the demo. I'm having to modify it as some things don't work with the iframes...
[01:25:51] <agcolom> popups don't come up, so I'll use a div to show the results
[01:27:15] <agcolom> also, $( document ).on( "pageinit", "#page1", function() { doesn't work :( so I have to use $( document ).ready( function() {
[01:27:42] <agcolom> I know it's not great as we recommend not to use that... 
[01:28:17] <agcolom> Maybe we could have a note somewhere in the api doc...
[01:31:07] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good morning Anne
[01:31:33] <uGoMobi> grrr iframes :(
[01:33:26] <agcolom> Good Morning Jasper :-)
[01:33:50] <agcolom> yes... iframes are great but sometimes can be a real pain ;-)
[01:35:37] <uGoMobi> of course we can add a not, but just feels a bit wrong to use code that we recommend not to use in our own demos
[01:35:44] <uGoMobi> s/not/note/
[01:37:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't know much about iframes because I try to avoid to use them but maybe _|Nix|_ or johnbender know a way to make this work
[01:37:34] <uGoMobi> or did they already looked into that?
[01:38:10] <didiergm> quick question - I opened several tickets thins morning re demos. I was not sure if you prefer one ticket with several related issues or separate tickets; please advise
[01:38:57] <uGoMobi> didiergm: I noticed :)
[01:39:11] <uGoMobi> didiergm: thanks for reporting the issues
[01:40:00] <uGoMobi> didiergm: if you think the issues are related you can open just one, if not, you can open multiple ones
[01:40:26] <uGoMobi> didiergm: and when you are not sure just open multiple ones
[01:41:09] <didiergm> uGoMobi: :), no problem, and ok will do (See just one line for 3 answers haha, ok I ->)
[01:41:25] <uGoMobi> :)

[02:27:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hmmm ... popups should come up in an iframe ... 
[02:28:17] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes, I am not sure why they don't I need to look more closely at the example. because I have other examples that work...
[02:28:56] <agcolom> so I'm not too worried about that one, but I like the div to show results so I'll stick to that as it is consistent with other examples I have
[02:29:34] <agcolom> the issue I'm more concerned about is that I can't get $( document ).on( "pageinit", "#page1", function() {  to work...
[02:29:51] <agcolom> (where page1 is the id of the page loaded in the iframe)
[02:30:33] <agcolom> but then it's an iframe created and loaded on the fly... so I haven't got full control of what is going on...
[02:30:42] <agcolom> I'll check again later and will let you know...
[02:31:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What version of jqm is being used in the examples?
[02:31:59] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: If running against master, things should work.
[02:32:24] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: However, if running against 1.3.1, things may not work because the iframe-specific modifications are not in place.
[02:32:45] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: ha! That may be it!
[02:32:51] <agcolom> let me try...
[02:36:00] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: 1.3.1 should work.
[02:36:59] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Currently, the template (entries2html.xsl) specifies 1.3.0. If you update to 1.3.1 it should work in FF.
[02:37:23] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#353 (master - 6ec5491 : Jasper de Groot): The build was broken.

[02:37:24] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, 1.3.0 breaks, but 1.3.1 works.
[02:38:33] <agcolom> ok, trying now with 1.3.1
[02:40:01] <agcolom> still no luck with pageinit with 1.3.1 :(
[02:40:16] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Maybe not with pageinit, but popups should work.
[02:40:33] <agcolom> Ah! I thought pageinit...
[02:41:00] <agcolom> anyidea why pageinit is not working (is it because of the iframe?)
[02:41:23] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Where's the example? I can check it out.
[02:41:40] <agcolom> ok, I'll push to stage so you can see...
[02:41:52] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK.
[02:42:21] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I have it set up locally, so http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/?????? will also work for me.

[02:44:35] <_|Nix|_> I'm cloning it, and it's been going for, like, 15 minutes ...
[02:44:48] <agcolom> Really ?? ;-)
[02:45:15] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... and for some reason it's coming down at only, like, 50K/s ...
[02:45:25] <_|Nix|_> .o0o.o0o.o0o.
[02:46:15] <agcolom> :-( 
[02:46:21] <agcolom> ok, it's up on http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.loadPage/
[02:46:25] <_|Nix|_> OK. I was able to pull.
[02:46:31] <agcolom> only look at the 1st example
[02:47:44] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Running grunt deploy ...
[02:47:46] <agcolom> If you replace $( document ).on( "pageinit", "#page1", function() { with $( document ).ready( function() { it works fine
[02:51:18] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK ... I can take a look at that example.
[02:51:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... see what else we need to fix inside iframes.
[02:51:39] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Is there an issue about this?
[02:51:55] <agcolom> no, because I was not aware of this issue
[02:51:57] <_|Nix|_> Holy cow! It's still cloning jqm ...
[02:52:03] <agcolom> :-)
[02:52:13] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's fine. I'll add a TODO for myself.
[02:52:24] <agcolom> Great thx:-) 
[02:52:25] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Nothing else to do while it's cloning, anyway :/
[02:52:54] <agcolom> I'll dispappear for a bit but will be back later... We have a bank holiday today so will be on and off..
[02:53:23] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: NP.

[03:02:22] <_|Nix|_> The good news is that FF 20 has fixed the iframe problem so popups work even with jqm 1.3.0 ...
[03:03:30] <_|Nix|_> OK ... this is weird ...
[03:05:08] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Wait a second - the examples ... they also need to be updated to 1.3.1, not just the template, right? Or are the examples generated from the template?

[04:16:07] <uGoMobi> agcolom: not sure though, have to check what that function does exactly (I forgot)
[04:16:20] <agcolom> Yes, I'm not sure either...

[04:19:21] <uGoMobi> yeah, then I think it's an object
[04:19:55] <agcolom> great! thanks! I wasn't sure whether it was the object or whether it was whether the object was enhanceable....

[09:29:48] <johnbender> agcolom: pageinit is gone from the latest
[09:30:01] <johnbender> agcolom: hmm
[09:30:02] <johnbender> or isi it
[09:30:04] <johnbender> agcolom: sorry
[09:30:07] <johnbender> it should be deprecated not remove
[09:30:09] <johnbender> *removed
[09:30:31] <johnbender> agcolom: sorry it's deprecated
[09:30:40] <johnbender> so pageinit isn't working in your demo?
[09:52:54] <toddmparker> Hi agcolom
[10:04:09] <agcolom> johnbender: ok thanks!
[10:04:25] <johnbender> agcolom: did you want me to take a look?
[10:04:32] <johnbender> agcolom: I mean give pagecreate a try
[10:04:36] <johnbender> but pageinit should still work
[10:04:38] <johnbender> so something is wrong
[10:04:56] <agcolom> yes, seems due to the iframe as without the iframe it works fine
[10:05:59] <agcolom> correct. you can see the example at http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.loadPage/ 
[10:06:07] <agcolom> (only the 1st example).
[10:07:29] <agcolom> However, changing $( document ).on( "pageinit", "#page1", function() { to $(document).ready(function() { fixes the problem
[10:07:55] <agcolom> but I thought we're recommending against using $(document).ready
[10:08:46] <agcolom> johnbender: so if pageinit is being deprecated, what will replace it?
[10:08:59] <johnbender> agcolom: pagecreate works again
[10:09:09] <agcolom> oh! 
[10:09:09] <johnbender> there was an update the UI  widget that put things back in place
[10:09:28] <agcolom> Oh Dear! I totally missed that!
[10:09:34] <johnbender> agcolom: it was a while ago
[10:10:00] <agcolom> so maybe I should just use pagecreate then...
[10:10:18] <agcolom> is pagecreate ok with 1.3.1?
[10:10:19] <johnbender> agcolom: it shouldn't make any difference
[10:10:26] <agcolom> ok
[10:10:33] <johnbender> agcolom: yah it should be
[10:10:39] <johnbender> hmm
[10:10:47] <johnbender> .
[10:10:55] <johnbender> agcolom: let me take a look at the example
[10:11:08] <uGoMobi> window.onload = function() {
[10:11:08] <uGoMobi> $( document ).on( "pageinit", "#page1", function() { ...
[10:11:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: seems to me you can omit the $( document ).on( "pageinit", "#page1", function() {
[10:11:36] <uGoMobi> ommit*
[10:12:03] <uGoMobi> you already bind to the load event
[10:12:27] <agcolom> trying... grunt deploy...
[10:13:45] <johnbender> uGoMobi: agcolom: where is the page init binding in the iframe document
[10:13:49] <johnbender> I can't find it
[10:13:54] <johnbender> I see the loadPage call
[10:15:28] <uGoMobi> johnbender: the script is in the body, sibling of the page div
[10:16:25] <agcolom> yes, I've just seen that the iframe adds window.onload = function() {
[10:16:34] <agcolom> hadn't seen that before.
[10:16:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I only see one
[10:16:58] <johnbender> and it only has the onload
[10:17:20] <agcolom> johnbender: are you looking on stage?
[10:17:27] <johnbender> yah the link you pasted
[10:17:34] <agcolom> (the 1st example)
[10:17:35] <johnbender> uGoMobi: do you mean outside the iframe?
[10:17:43] <uGoMobi> johnbender: nope
[10:17:47] <johnbender> agcolom: ah,
[10:17:52] <johnbender> I'm looking at the second one
[10:17:54] <johnbender> my fault :(
[10:18:06] <uGoMobi> good morning johnbender :)
[10:18:11] <johnbender> lolol
[10:18:29] <uGoMobi> brb... dinner time here
[10:19:39] <agcolom> Have a nice dinner Jasper!
[10:20:23] <johnbender> agcolom: I think that uGoMobi was suggesting you remove the onload because the binding might need to come before that to grab the first page init?

[12:33:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I saw the commet
[12:34:03] <uGoMobi> comment*
[12:34:05] <arschmitz> cool 
[12:34:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think we have to look at those 2 commits....
[12:34:27] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/997658cb633ce4a5fec6d8e6dd47f1953b6f6ddd
[12:34:38] <uGoMobi> and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b2b429b3968d9fc4c3c17c5badec879b4e7f0a31
[12:35:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i was looking at those as well as a couple similar slider ones
[12:36:08] <uGoMobi> okay great
[12:36:17] <arschmitz> it only effects range slider but that does not mean it was not a change to slider that causes it
[12:36:29] <uGoMobi> I focus on "next" so when I saw it was any issue on master I opened a ticket
[12:36:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes exactly
[12:36:42] <arschmitz> yup
[12:36:48] <arschmitz> hey speaking of sliders though
[12:37:03] <arschmitz> it had been briefly mentioned a week or so ago looking at pulling in ui one
[12:37:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I remember we had to do something to make sure the rangeslider gets the disabled class at the right element
[12:37:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[12:37:33] <arschmitz> i wanted your thoughts on this because theirs is pretty fundamentally different
[12:37:42] <arschmitz> you cant call it on an input 
[12:37:53] <arschmitz> it only effects inputs via setting a callback
[12:38:03] <uGoMobi> I see
[12:38:12] <arschmitz> so this would drasticly change our concept of how sliders work
[12:38:17] <uGoMobi> so there is no native element at all?
[12:38:22] <arschmitz> div
[12:38:23] <agcolom> johnbender uGoMobi : I think I'm going mad! Something that was working this morning is no longer working... could it be because we moved from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1?
[12:38:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, but no native form element?
[12:38:52] <arschmitz> agcolom: its possible there were changes though i hope we didnt break anything
[12:38:56] <arschmitz> nope
[12:39:13] <arschmitz> its not a form widget in ui its just a track and handle
[12:39:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[12:39:27] <arschmitz> that does nothing but sldier back and forth 
[12:39:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not really progressive enhancement
[12:39:35] <agcolom> in the same example, if I remove pageinit, I get an error when trying to load the page using loadPage
[12:39:56] <uGoMobi> if no JS then no input
[12:40:04] <agcolom> TypeError: i is undefined
[12:40:20] <arschmitz> agcolom: you have a link or something i can look at maybe i can help?
[12:40:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no not exactly because to use it with an input you have to put the input in the page
[12:40:43] <agcolom> ok, I'll just push so you can see on stage. Would that be ok?
[12:40:48] <arschmitz> and define a call back for the slider to update it
[12:40:50] <agcolom> arschmitz: ^
[12:40:55] <arschmitz> agcolom: sure
[12:41:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right
[12:41:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im sure we could make an extension to shim it to work in a similar fashion
[12:41:30] <arschmitz> im just not sure if this is the right direction to go or not 
[12:42:05] <arschmitz> the only reason it might be its there is a lot less work in maintaining an extension then 2 seperate widgets
[12:42:41] <arschmitz> and ui's slider can do a lot more things then ours can
[12:43:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how about performance?
[12:43:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when you use it with a callback
[12:43:33] <arschmitz> can really say because there's does not currently support touch
[12:43:39] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:43:50] <arschmitz> well it does in the interactions branches
[12:44:13] <arschmitz> also hard to measure performance with this sort of thing
[12:44:27] <arschmitz> but i guess i could put like 50 on a page and see what android does :)
[12:44:37] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:44:49] <uGoMobi> I know our slider will make it crash
[12:44:53] <arschmitz> right now it coughs and gives up as we discovered
[12:44:59] <arschmitz> yup

[12:45:26] <uGoMobi> I am not really sure what to think about moving in this direction
[12:45:39] <arschmitz> thats probably the place to start take ours, ui's and maybe the one i wrote and see which androids hates the least 
[12:46:13] <agcolom> arschmitz: stage.api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.loadPage/
[12:46:25] <agcolom> if you look at the 1st example
[12:46:40] <agcolom> Maybe I'm missing something obvious??
[12:49:57] <arschmitz> agcolom: its a bug thats fixed on master and 1.3 stable but is in 1.3.1
[12:50:04] <arschmitz> its nothing your doing wrong
[12:50:59] <arschmitz> agcolom: loadpage is broken 
[12:50:59] <agcolom> OMG!!!! I spent about 2h thinking I was going mad ;-) !!!!!
[12:51:14] <arschmitz> :) i fixed that bug either last week or the week before
[12:51:27] <arschmitz> agcolom: sorry about that 
[12:51:37] <agcolom> arschmitz: no problem at all ;-)
[12:52:07] <agcolom> ok, how can we get around this?
[12:52:24] <arschmitz> not sure there is a way around it until 1.3.2
[12:52:40] <uGoMobi> did you cherry-pick arschmitz ? ;)
[12:52:41] <agcolom> right. ok. that should be fine.
[12:52:42] <arschmitz> oh wait yes there is
[12:53:02] <agcolom> I'm ok to wait until 1.3.2
[12:53:24] <agcolom> do we have an idea about when 1.3.2 will be out?
[12:53:34] <arschmitz> agcolom: change it to pass a second param of true to load page and it will work
[12:53:34] <uGoMobi> we shouldn't wait too long with 1.3.2 I think
[12:53:46] <gseguin> no we shouldn't
[12:53:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i agree i know at least a hand full of major bugs in 1.3.1
[12:53:55] <uGoMobi> with all the issues we have with the demos :(
[12:54:05] <gseguin> how about next week ?
[12:54:10] <uGoMobi> +1
[12:54:13] <arschmitz> +1
[12:54:28] <arschmitz> even if its just a handle full of things we have done already its worth it
[12:54:48] <uGoMobi> yeah I agree
[12:55:16] <arschmitz> gota make sure to fix rangeslider first :) lol
[12:55:38] <arschmitz> but thats no problem i just need to bisect a few commits should not take long at all
[12:56:34] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes, adding a secong param with value true fixes it ;-)
[12:56:41] <agcolom> second ^ 
[12:56:55] <agcolom> Seriously I thought I was going crazy ;-)
[12:57:07] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah your not suposed to have to do that but it will fix the issue
[12:57:31] <agcolom> ok, I'll add an issue to remove that when we upgrade to 1.3.2
[12:58:02] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah it was an accidental regression from a fix for a different issue that somehow didnt trip up any tests
[12:59:06] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/T_d8lA

[12:59:28] <agcolom> arschmitz: no worries ;-) All is well that ends well (Hope I got that right ?)
[12:59:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if you see any issues you think we should try and get fixed for 1.3.2 that seem like something for me feel free to kick my way im going to try and get some bugs fixed this week
[13:00:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok will do, thanks
[13:00:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/1.3-stable?page=1 I don't see any loadPage fix
[13:00:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: weird swear i cherry picked that when you mentioned it last week ill do it right now give me a chance to try the new github for mac app i just got
[13:01:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that was about another fix that needs to be cherry picked
[13:01:42] <uGoMobi> I re-opened that ticket
[13:02:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oops sorry
[13:02:07] <uGoMobi> not another fix, that is the one
[13:02:09] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5877

[13:04:51] <uGoMobi> what is that about?
[13:06:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you got me thats why i asked
[13:06:39] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:06:54] <arschmitz> i fully plan on closing but figured id give them a chance to respond first
[13:07:10] <arschmitz> incase im really missing something
[13:07:15] <agcolom> I'm guessing that he wants the value to be 1 when the checkbox is checked and 0 when not checked...
[13:07:25] <s5fs> ^^^
[13:07:26] <uGoMobi> yeah let's be nice
[13:07:58] <arschmitz> agcolom: i agree but we are not going to make that change we maintain native behivor 
[13:08:14] <agcolom> hi s5fs ! 
[13:08:21] <agcolom> arschmitz: I agree ;-)
[13:08:23] <arschmitz> agcolom: but i want to give them a chance to clarify incase they are talking about something else
[13:08:43] <s5fs> agcolom: hello!
[13:09:01] <arschmitz> hey s5fs: nice to have you on board
[13:09:01] <agcolom> s5fs: Welcome to the team! 
[13:09:15] <s5fs> thanks everyone, very happy to be here :)
[13:09:28] <gseguin> Hi s5fs! Welcome!
[13:09:28] <agcolom> oh I need some power (on reserve battery! not good...)
[13:09:51] <uGoMobi> welcome s5fs 
[13:09:58] <arschmitz> s5fs: good timing on joinging you will have everyone right in your backyard to meet in a month lol
[13:10:19] <s5fs> arschmitz: no doubt, weather is beautiful too, great timing to visit portland
[13:10:39] <gseguin> only time for that, isn't it? ;-)
[13:10:42] <arschmitz> yeah its nice here in portland right now too ( im in portland maine :) )
[13:11:03] <agcolom> going to be hard for us from Europe!!!! 8 to 10h difference!!!!!
[13:11:21] <s5fs> haha, all portlands are checking in!
[13:11:58] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah when i went to jquery asia the difference was rough +13hours
[13:12:14] <agcolom> whoa! 
[13:12:37] <arschmitz> agcolom: it corsses the date line too which really messes with you
[13:13:00] <agcolom> I can believe that!
[13:13:23] <arschmitz> a few of us actually got home before they left!
[13:13:33] <s5fs> magic!
[13:13:52] <agcolom> My problem was that although I was really tired and going to bed at 1am, I'd still wake up at 6am! 
[13:14:11] <agcolom> I slept 14h straight when I got back ;-)
[13:17:21] <arschmitz> s5fs: do you know Dan Heberdan? hes in portland too if im not mistaken.
[13:25:29] <s5fs> arschmitz: I met him last week, very nice guy
[13:26:44] <arschmitz> s5fs: for sure i think he was one of the magic time travelers from korea ha ha
[13:27:54] <s5fs> arschmitz: wouldn't surpise me, he did have an air of amazing about him
[13:28:05] <s5fs> could've just been the hair, though ;-)
[13:28:12] <arschmitz> ha ha
[13:42:05] <agcolom> arschmitz: uGoMobi it looks like there's something else broken, but I'm not sure from when...

[13:42:42] <agcolom> see at http://api.jquerymobile.com/dialog/
[13:42:50] <agcolom> go right tothe botom
[13:43:32] <agcolom> the example shows the dialog and then loads the full page in the iframe. We didn't have that before. Any link in an iframe now behaves like this 
[13:43:33] <arschmitz> agcolom: close button not working on dialog?
[13:43:46] <arschmitz> oh
[13:43:52] <arschmitz> agcolom: firefox?
[13:43:55] <agcolom> yes
[13:44:04] <agcolom> oh, I'll try Safari...
[13:45:01] <agcolom> not an issue in Chrome!
[13:45:24] <arschmitz> yeah im seeing sam
[13:45:37] <arschmitz> works fine in webkit firefox loads the page
[13:45:38] <agcolom> Safari is fine also! so only F
[13:45:41] <agcolom> FF
[13:46:00] <uGoMobi> fun
[13:46:11] <agcolom> is this a known problem? I alsways use FF and it was not the case with the previous version
[13:46:21] <agcolom> (prev of FF I think)
[13:46:26] <arschmitz> agcolom: not that i know of off the top of my head
[13:46:39] <agcolom> I'm on FF 20
[13:46:45] <arschmitz> yeah me too
[13:46:53] <agcolom> so frustrating!!!!!!
[13:47:13] <agcolom> now is it due to jqm or not is the question!
[13:47:31] <arschmitz> does not really matter lol we need to fix it some how
[13:47:53] <agcolom> unless it happens to iframes without jqm
[13:48:00] <arschmitz> true
[13:48:11] <arschmitz> i can test that easy just one sec
[13:50:04] <arschmitz> agcolom: your saying any link in an iframe is doing this?
[13:50:15] <agcolom> yes
[13:51:52] <agcolom> I went to http://api.jquerymobile.com/dialog/ and with the inspector I removed the jqm css and js. I clicked the link and same thing, the whole page is loaded into hte iframe so I think it's not related to jqm
[13:52:01] <agcolom> (on the last example)
[13:54:12] <agcolom> but the strange thing is it doesn't happen on the early examples....
[13:54:20] <agcolom> What is the difference?
[13:56:17] <agcolom> oh, could it be that it happens only on pages with a link to the current document?
[13:56:22] <agcolom> I think this is it....
[13:56:53] <agcolom> It's on links that go to another page in the same document! (a href="#something")
[13:56:56] <agcolom> arschmitz: ^
[13:57:16] <arschmitz> agcolom: that helps narrow it down a bit
[13:58:26] <agcolom> oh, is it because of the turnOffPushState.js ?
[13:58:30] <agcolom> arschmitz: ^
[13:58:48] <arschmitz> could be im doing some tests right now
[13:59:00] <agcolom> ok, I'll remove and test local.
[14:01:47] <arschmitz> agcolom: happens in any multi-page template page
