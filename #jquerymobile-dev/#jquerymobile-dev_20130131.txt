[03:16:16] <rxaviers> gseguin, RWhitbeck, do you plan to include a template engine to process the JSON and generate the html in the client (like handlebars)? (or inline html strings is just fine)

[03:18:23] <rxaviers> I just re-read your yesterday's convo.
[03:20:21] <rxaviers> It seems to me we'll have a lot of common parts
[03:21:21] <rxaviers> like managing dependency/dependents, handling toggleAll logic
[03:21:46] <rxaviers> that's not a big deal, but will be duplicate for sure.
[03:22:46] <rxaviers> maybe, we could accommodate a way of abstracting that common logics and re-use it in UI/mobile;
[03:23:13] <rxaviers> we do render stuff dynamically too depending of version chosen
[03:23:29] <rxaviers> Just let me know if you guys are interested in joining efforts
[05:41:32] <_|Nix|_> Hey! If anyone's interested: http://localhost/nix/web-ui-fw/demos/widgets/ctxpopup.html
[05:58:45] <arschmitz_> _|Nix|_: localhost links dont often work well for sharing :)
[06:03:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: Duuuuh :)
[06:04:01] <_|Nix|_> Hey! If anyone's interested: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/web-ui-fw/demos/widgets/ctxpopup.html
[06:04:08] <arschmitz_> im annoyed i dont know why i have an underscore!
[06:04:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: You didn't authenticate to NickServ
[06:04:44] <_|Nix|_> Set your nick to arschmitz and authenticate to NickServ ...
[06:05:17] <arschmitz_> it should have its all setup in znc
[06:05:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: *shrug* ...
[06:06:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: That's all I know ...
[06:06:10] <arschmitz_> yeah
[06:06:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: If you don't authenticate for a while NickServ forces you to change your nick.
[06:06:50] <arschmitz_> i got toddmparker: set up on znc yesterday on his phone so he should have fewer personas now lol
[06:07:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: Or, maybe it's not NickServ, but the server, because sometimes, when I log in I also have an _. So, I'm thinking that NickServ goes offline, and so the server has no way of authenticating you, and it goes into failsafe mode.
[06:07:32] <_|Nix|_> :)
[06:07:34] <arschmitz_> maybe
[06:08:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: Does znc also relay your commands back to the server?
[06:08:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: So you can /nick arschmitz and /msg NickServ identify ?????
[06:08:49] <arschmitz_> i think so iv only been using it a short time
[06:10:30] <_|Nix|_> Ha! There ya go ...
[06:10:36] <arschmitz> yup
[06:11:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, what do you think about that popup? It's a mess of three divs, css clips and transforms with custom matrices :)
[06:12:08] <arschmitz> its awesome if we could get it to work consistantly
[06:12:20] <_|Nix|_> And, amazingly, it works on Android 2.3.5, WP7.5, and iOS 6.0.1 ...
[06:12:23] <arschmitz> its something a lot of people asked for on the original popup
[06:12:42] <arschmitz> perfect for custom selects
[06:12:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We actually had it in web-ui-fw, but it was even worse, because it used borders to create the triangle.
[06:13:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This thing actually respects the gradient - by reflecting it :)
[06:13:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ this would fail completely in ie right?
[06:13:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No idea. It worked on WP7.5 ...
[06:13:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But likely.
[06:13:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We'd need a fallback.
[06:14:07] <arschmitz> wow really i just assumed it wouldnt ha ha ha
[06:14:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I too was amazed.
[06:14:26] <arschmitz> i should check it out on my new htz mazza i got with 7.8 :)
[06:14:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: All I had to do was add all the prefixed versions of transform

[06:14:53] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz and _|Nix|_ 
[06:14:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[06:15:07] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi!
[06:15:10] <uGoMobi> how's the windows phone arschmitz ?
[06:15:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wasted my morning creating http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/web-ui-fw/demos/widgets/ctxpopup.html ... whaddya think?
[06:15:36] * uGoMobi is looking
[06:15:39] <arschmitz> just plugged it in to charge a few minutes ago this will be the first thing iv tried
[06:16:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ohh that's cool! 
[06:16:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I hope my page doesn't fry your new phone :)
[06:16:06] <arschmitz> ha ha
[06:16:06] <uGoMobi> no waste of time at all
[06:16:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wait till you look at the source. You will never be the same again :)
[06:16:47] <uGoMobi> haha
[06:17:00] <uGoMobi> ok I am a dare devil... here I go
[06:17:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, I don't think it works with rounded corners in webkit, because webkit doesn't correctly clip to the rounded corners.
[06:17:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: looks great on 7.8
[06:17:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[06:17:37] <arschmitz> no to get real crazy and try on a blackberry!
[06:17:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe this helps...
[06:17:52] <uGoMobi> -webkit-background-clip: padding;
[06:17:52] <uGoMobi>         background-clip: padding-box;
[06:18:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can try that, but I've had very little success in Chrome - but that was a while ago.
[06:19:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this reminds me we have to add your slider tooltip demo to the new demos
[06:19:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but that's a slider extension inside web-ui-fw ...
[06:19:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I need to port it over ...
[06:20:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is that targeted for 1.3.0?
[06:20:43] <uGoMobi> http://web-ui-fw.github.com/#slider-demo
[06:21:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: that's a pretty old version of jQM ...
[06:21:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/clip.html works on newer Chrome - amazing!
[06:21:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah we would like to add this to the demos for 1.3
[06:21:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: On older versions, the red corner would poke out.
[06:21:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah cool
[06:22:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: *whew* ... OK ... I guess I better get cracking ...
[06:22:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good thing Chrome has a rapid release program
[06:22:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[06:22:41] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I guess I'll get cracking on that popup ...
[06:22:44] <arschmitz> toddmparker: and i were playing with some new blackberry 10 phones they got
[06:22:47] <_|Nix|_> I mean tooltip.
[06:22:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well, maybe we can add one or two of the other examples here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5045 first
[06:22:54] <arschmitz> super broken browser lol
[06:23:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: aii :(
[06:23:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was it updated?
[06:23:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ that popup actually works on blackberry 6!
[06:23:37] <arschmitz> not sure they were straight from the package
[06:23:43] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:23:48] <uGoMobi> you got BB device now too?
[06:24:04] <arschmitz> yeah an old bb style
[06:24:11] <arschmitz> its not even a touch screen lol
[06:24:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *clank* ... that's my jaw hitting the floor!
[06:24:17] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:24:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its got the little pointer thing
[06:24:37] <arschmitz> but hey for testing it works lol
[06:24:44] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:24:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Does it work on BB10?
[06:24:57] <uGoMobi> and many people out there with Bold/Curve with BB7
[06:25:03] <arschmitz> it had been left for dead and not functional
[06:25:14] <uGoMobi> so useful to be able to test on it
[06:25:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont have a 10 sorry
[06:25:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK ... NP ...
[06:25:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker: has a few now though
[06:25:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: exactly!
[06:26:00] <uGoMobi> maybe I buy a Curve with BB7... those are not that expensive anymore
[06:26:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[06:26:28] <arschmitz> i bet you can get a free something at bb jam next week
[06:26:40] <arschmitz> they always give stuff away
[06:26:44] <uGoMobi> and I ordered a new android 2.3 device... feels like that is a must have
[06:27:05] <uGoMobi> a LG L3 for less than 100 euro
[06:27:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: last bunch of stuff they have given playbooks away
[06:27:14] <uGoMobi> oh that would be nice arschmitz  :)
[06:27:28] <arschmitz> toddmparker: said he would bet you get somethign too
[06:28:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so keep your fingers crossed lol
[06:28:27] <uGoMobi> haha yeah
[06:28:48] <_|Nix|_> Well, I'll be darned: Corners actually work (on Chrome/desktop): http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/web-ui-fw/demos/widgets/ctxpopup1.html
[06:29:19] <uGoMobi> yeah they do
[06:29:22] <_|Nix|_> Same for FF18/desktop.
[06:29:31] <uGoMobi> but I like the one without corners more :)
[06:29:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, if we allow corners, then the arrow needs to be bigger.
[06:29:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, me too.
[06:29:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No point making an arrow if it's gonna be blunt.
[06:30:08] <_|Nix|_> Get it? "No point" *snicker*
[06:30:23] <arschmitz> ha ha
[06:30:30] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:31:41] <arschmitz> no suprise but ie7 your popup is not ok lol
[06:31:47] <uGoMobi> have to check browser support for CSS clip
[06:31:54] <arschmitz> but thats a simple fix opt ie7 and 8 out
[06:32:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep ...
[06:32:02] <uGoMobi> maybe we can do demo of back button with point
[06:32:16] <uGoMobi> so people won't keep asking for it anymore :)
[06:32:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ie8 is actually ok
[06:32:33] <arschmitz> it essentially opts it self out
[06:32:47] <arschmitz> it just shows as if there was nothing special at all
[06:32:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we can use the border-hack-version for IE7/8: http://web-ui-fw.github.com/#ctxpopup-demo
[06:32:59] <uGoMobi> sounds like PE to me
[06:33:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: PE > OK in jQM
[06:33:29] <uGoMobi> I don't think we should spoil IE7 users with such a nice popup with pointer
[06:33:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:yeah would just need to fix for ie7
[06:33:50] <arschmitz> right now it shows a big white box over the popup so you cant read it lol
[06:33:51] <uGoMobi> sorry for your co-workers arschmitz ;)
[06:34:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Here goes M$ again, wasting everyone's energy. Score another 1.0e-6 degrees C for global warming.
[06:34:19] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:34:26] <arschmitz> lol
[06:34:39] <arschmitz> yeah i dont care about ie other then to make it functional not pretty
[06:35:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... and now we have a nice, clean, $.mobile.browser.oldIE switch, IIRC, so ... 
[06:35:30] <arschmitz> that hits ie9 too
[06:35:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh ... hmm ... whatever ... 
[06:36:05] <arschmitz> you dont want to do that ie9 is fine and would also opt out windows phones which work great
[06:36:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's the IE tax *shrug*
[06:36:17] <arschmitz> lol
[06:36:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, OK ... 
[06:36:32] <uGoMobi> too bad CSS masks isn't supported yet https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/CSS/mask
[06:36:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: all you need to do it is add a css rule
[06:36:40] <uGoMobi> would make this easier
[06:36:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Doesn't IE have all kinds of transforms and stuff ...
[06:37:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like DirectX-based, or whatever.
[06:37:10] <uGoMobi> yes they have
[06:37:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah if you wanted to spoil them you could do it easy with that stuff
[06:37:25] <arschmitz> filters and such
[06:37:35] <_|Nix|_> So, maybe we can figure out something equivalent to transform: matrix() and clip()
[06:37:48] <arschmitz> most of the css3 stuff is still possible in old ie 
[06:37:53] <arschmitz> its just painfull lol
[06:38:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I'd rather keep things in the CSS if possible.
[06:38:14] <uGoMobi> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms530752(v=vs.85).aspx
[06:38:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah its all css stuff
[06:40:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think im going to start going to pawn shops to look for cheap test devices lol
[06:40:14] <_|Nix|_> :)
[06:40:29] <uGoMobi> good idea
[06:42:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker: gave me the idea yesterday
[06:42:15] <arschmitz> ebay people tend to know what their stuff is worth
[06:42:22] <arschmitz> pawn shops not as much lol
[06:42:26] <toddmparker> Morning
[06:42:26] <uGoMobi> pawn shops aren't very common here
[06:42:33] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:42:34] <toddmparker> Catching up
[06:42:38] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[06:42:52] <arschmitz> well if i find uGoMobi: if i find a good deal i dont want ill let you know lol
[06:42:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Hey!
[06:42:53] <gnarf> arschmitz: one would think that pawn shops know how to search ebay tho
[06:42:55] <gnarf> :)
[06:43:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool
[06:43:02] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker
[06:43:12] <arschmitz> gnarf: yeah i live in maine
[06:43:17] <gnarf> arschmitz: :)
[06:43:18] <arschmitz> lol
[06:44:00] <arschmitz> gnarf: im pretty sure some of the pawn shops iv seen around here the owners dont know how to use the internet ha ha ha 
[06:45:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I added ui-icon-nodisc to theme CSS and updated the icon demo page
[06:47:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/buttons/ on BB10 only like the top 2/3 of this page will render
[06:48:04] <arschmitz> below that you just get static pixels
[06:48:37] <uGoMobi> hmm
[06:49:04] <uGoMobi> they expect a keyboard there or something? ;)
[06:49:11] <arschmitz> lol
[06:49:12] <toddmparker> Popup with arrow looks cool
[06:49:16] <toddmparker> Be a good demo for sure
[06:49:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: all looks good your scrolling down and you hit a point where it just stops and is static pixels for rest of page
[06:49:39] <uGoMobi> yeah nice pointy popup
[06:49:53] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I'll try to get you some devices 
[06:49:56] <arschmitz> toddmparker: that pointy popup has great support
[06:50:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: oh great, thanks!
[06:50:25] <arschmitz> the only device or browser i tried it does not work fine on is IE7 and that could be fixed with just a css rule
[06:50:48] <arschmitz> toddmparker: it even works on the old bb6 
[06:50:50] <toddmparker> Definitely a wp7, but I'll see if I can scare up a BB
[06:51:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i saw some stuff about how to fix that playbook online
[06:51:29] <toddmparker> arschmitz: Yeah?
[06:51:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that would be very useful. was thinking of buying a curve BB7
[06:51:38] <arschmitz> yeah found a few different things to try
[06:51:46] <uGoMobi> but arschmitz told me I should wait until after BB Jam
[06:51:54] <uGoMobi> will see
[06:51:55] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I'll get you a device
[06:52:06] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[06:53:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BB10 browser also had issues with box-shadow
[06:53:27] <uGoMobi> did you notice?
[06:53:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[06:53:58] <arschmitz> we noticed it right off
[06:54:34] <uGoMobi> bad
[06:55:10] <arschmitz> JasonDScott___ said they have fixed it with the latest build though
[06:55:14] <uGoMobi> if I would have done triage at BB I would have flagged it "blocker"
[06:55:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok
[06:55:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah its pretty bad
[06:56:01] <uGoMobi> so it is fixed for the final release
[06:56:17] <arschmitz> i mean i guess its not a usability issue but looks really bad
[06:56:46] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:56:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i think toddmparker: and i came up with a good plan for ajax in the docs
[06:57:06] <uGoMobi> tell me
[06:57:18] <arschmitz> disable it globally 
[06:57:24] <uGoMobi> +1
[06:57:30] <arschmitz> then on the panel we include with php
[06:57:44] <arschmitz> add data-ajax="false" on the actual container
[06:58:07] <arschmitz> and anywhere we enable ajax on a page also enable set ignorecontentenabled
[06:58:19] <arschmitz> so the nav panel is always non ajax
[06:58:37] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[06:58:43] <arschmitz> then all you need to worry about remembering to set false on is any links you put on the page yourself
[06:58:46] <_|Nix|_> For that slider-with-tooltip demo, do we want the value displayed inside the slider button, like at http://web-ui-fw.github.com/#slider-demo?
[06:58:49] <uGoMobi> wasn't ignorecontentenabled bad for performance?
[06:59:04] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[06:59:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes but it will only be on a handfull of pages in demos
[06:59:08] <uGoMobi> well will probably be fine on desktop
[06:59:15] <uGoMobi> right
[06:59:31] <arschmitz> like right now the only page that would need it is your swipe demo i think
[06:59:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think? Should I include the display-slider-value-inside-slider-button portion of the code as well?
[07:00:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think both ways make good demos
[07:00:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[07:00:19] <uGoMobi> yeah me too
[07:00:34] <uGoMobi> is it lot of additional work?
[07:00:47] <uGoMobi> could add second demo later if running out of time
[07:00:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I have the web-ui-fw code for reference ...
[07:01:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I actually think that I'll do most of the work tomorrow and over the weekend, because doing that popup took most of my day - that, and the web-ui-fw meeting in the morning.
[07:01:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we do a RC on monday
[07:01:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: meeting later today too
[07:02:07] <uGoMobi> and we want the demos to be ready for final
[07:02:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Have you seen this? http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/web-ui-fw/demos/widgets/ctxpopup.html
[07:02:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I'll try to squeeze it in.
[07:02:36] <uGoMobi> great
[07:02:40] <uGoMobi> would be cool
[07:02:46] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[07:03:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ there will be some time between rc and final too
[07:03:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If it doesn't make it into 1.3, I can always put it inside web-ui-fw ... :)
[07:03:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you see my comment here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5514#issuecomment-12889802
[07:03:10] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:03:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no i had not looking now
[07:04:14] <uGoMobi> was just thinking if this is something that needs to be fixed in custom select
[07:04:48] <uGoMobi> s/custom select/select/
[07:04:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so it fires change but keeps focus when the popup closes?
[07:04:53] <toddmparker> i'm working on organizing the test lab and will see what's up for loan
[07:05:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[07:05:50] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: I agree that both slider demos would be cool
[07:06:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: What do you think about that popup?
[07:06:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: only when you tab elsewhere it loses focus and the toolbar will show up again
[07:06:20] <uGoMobi> tap*
[07:06:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It seems to work most places, except IE <= 8
[07:06:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ really its fine in ie8 just not pointy
[07:06:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... but that can be fixed with IE's proprietary DirectX transforms ...
[07:06:56] <toddmparker> that's impressive. i like it. is there a way to set arrow direction or top only?
[07:07:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK ... Well, IE < 8 then.
[07:07:02] <toddmparker> fine for a demo
[07:07:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's just testing the mechanism for creating the arrow.
[07:07:17] <toddmparker> think the directs ones are slow as hell
[07:07:40] <toddmparker> sure, even just to show how it's done will give people a good starting point
[07:07:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker: they are but that would be desktop only too so not AS bad
[07:07:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The final version will have to have 4 different arrows, of course, and the positioning code from web-ui-fw.
[07:07:52] <toddmparker> true
[07:07:58] <toddmparker> cool!
[07:08:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I can add this to web-ui-fw ...
[07:08:18] <arschmitz> and can always just optout ie7 with css and call it a day if you wanted too
[07:08:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe we can use a selector that IE7 doesn't understand so you would just see the popup, no pointer
[07:08:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
[07:08:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats what i was talking about
[07:09:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I know but I didn't look while I was typing ;)
[07:09:22] <arschmitz> lol yeah and delay
[07:09:35] <_|Nix|_> OKOK. This all sounds very cool 'n all, but I'm getting confused. This arrow thing, if we do it, would be part of 1.3.1 at least, if not 1.4.0 ... right?
[07:09:35] <arschmitz> i mean we are ONLY 6 timezones apart lol
[07:09:43] <uGoMobi> yeah... Amsterdam >> Portland
[07:09:47] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:10:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if we added thats a feature so 1.4
[07:10:22] <arschmitz> but could be demo for 1.3
[07:11:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, but we should discuss this during the meeting. Changsuk and his team also promised that they'd look into ways of making the arrow blend in seemlessly with the popup, so we may end up getting some help from them as well.
[07:11:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because we'd have to add this to the roadmap.
[07:12:09] * _|Nix|_ already has one point for tonight's agenda ...
[07:12:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i think so
[07:13:17] <_|Nix|_> OK ... cool!
[07:13:51] <_|Nix|_> Someday, we'll have polybezier divs ... but not today ...
[07:14:29] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:15:02] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yeah, the arrow would be a demo
[07:15:29] <toddmparker> we could think bout adding it at some point, just a matter of seeing where it fits in the roadmap
[07:15:44] <toddmparker> that's why a demo of what you have now is cool (and less works for you)
[07:15:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: For sure, but what about the long run? I'd write it as an extension ...
[07:16:13] <toddmparker> in the long run, we could definitely look at including this 
[07:16:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: personally i think it would be a great extension for down the road very requested 
[07:16:46] <toddmparker> may end up being 1.5 since we're going to have our hands full on 1.4
[07:16:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Oh, definitely.
[07:16:57] <toddmparker> trying to not add much for 1.4 so we can focus on re-factoring
[07:17:01] <arschmitz> very very true
[07:17:06] <uGoMobi> +1
[07:17:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: +139
[07:17:14] <uGoMobi> =+140
[07:17:20] <toddmparker> definitely a popular feature, extension would eb a nice way to go
[07:17:39] <arschmitz> yup then people that dont care can just do a custom build without it
[07:17:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, even if we put the extension in the demos. That way, we can tell people that it's low priority, if they start filing bugs against it.
[07:18:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Like, "Yes, eventually we'll pretty it up and move it into the library, but for now, we're working on something else".
[07:19:02] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, I have to take a break until at most meeting time. I'll BBIAB.
[07:19:19] <uGoMobi> later _|Nix|_ 
[07:19:55] <toddmparker> I have a meeting for the next 2-3 hours
[07:20:40] <toddmparker> I want to release the RC on Monday so lets focus on any last fixes.
[07:20:50] <toddmparker> Pencils down tomorrow ideally
[07:21:17] <toddmparker> After the RC, we don't touch 1.3 unless there a baddie
[07:21:29] <toddmparker> So this is final, folks
[07:21:40] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:21:54] <uGoMobi> still working at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5510 at the moment
[07:22:22] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: That is a great once to patch up
[07:22:32] <toddmparker> One. Autocorrect
[07:22:46] <uGoMobi> yeah really want to have a solution for that today
[07:23:01] <toddmparker> Me too
[07:31:11] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15CarpeTempus opened issue #5561: Panel ignores header-height  02http://git.io/vhGkzQ
[07:46:50] <gseguin> rxaviers: that sounds like a cleaner solution than what we have now
[07:47:32] <gseguin> mornin' all
[07:47:44] <arschmitz> morning gseguin
[07:49:06] <arschmitz> gseguin: its a little hard to see lol but ... http://www.jtbourne.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/seguin.jpg
[07:49:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: saw that and naturally thought of you 
[07:49:58] <gseguin> haha! I'm famous?!
[07:49:58] <gseguin> :P
[07:50:07] <arschmitz> lol 
[07:50:10] <rxaviers> gseguin, nice! I think we could discuss that in more details
[07:50:54] <arschmitz> gseguin: thats a famous hockey player for the boston bruins Tyler Seguin
[07:51:54] <gseguin> arschmitz: man you just broke my dream of having someone tatoo my name on his arm
[07:52:02] <arschmitz> lol
[07:52:49] <arschmitz> no thats it he got it as a homage to his most respected distant relative
[07:53:40] <arschmitz> gseguin: the famous Ghislain!
[07:54:14] <gseguin> heh :)
[07:54:22] <gseguin> are you still at Filament?
[07:54:59] <arschmitz> gseguin: no i was just down for the day
[07:55:11] <gseguin> HA! it's on the github page!: we support 1.7.0 to 1.9.0
[07:55:30] <gseguin> I was wondering why tests weren't passing with 1.6.4
[07:55:34] <arschmitz> boston is not far from me ill be in boston again tomorrow lol but not at filament
[07:55:36] <gseguin> now I know :)
[07:55:44] <arschmitz> gseguin yeah we use live
[07:56:10] <arschmitz> i mean on ha ha
[07:56:10] <gseguin> wait we do?
[07:56:13] <arschmitz> wow wrogn way
[07:56:25] <gseguin> yeah but in the test code
[07:56:29] <gseguin> that could be replace
[07:56:36] <gseguin> d
[07:58:01] <arschmitz> why if we dont support before 1.7 though?
[07:58:34] <gseguin> anyhow now the only tests failing are: tests/unit/navigation/sequence/sequence-push-state-disabled-dialog-hash-key-tests.html 
[07:58:55] <gseguin> broader support is better
[07:59:47] <gseguin> but I wouldn't go out of my way to extend support either
[08:00:11] <gseguin> and it's official that we don't support < 1.7.0 so let's leave it like that
[08:00:36] <arschmitz> that was my thought
[08:10:22] <toddmparker> hopping into my meeting now…be back around 1
[08:10:37] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: found at least 3 BB's I could loan out
[08:10:53] <arschmitz> toddmparker: more of the ones like i got?
[08:11:20] <arschmitz> they are not great but work for testing!
[08:11:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: oh great
[08:12:27] <uGoMobi> what BB OS version?
[08:14:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if they are the same as he gave me (i know he said he had a couple) its 6
[08:15:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://bit.ly/XLVLTM 
[08:16:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks
[08:17:06] <arschmitz> not sure if thats what hes got for you but he had a few so godd chance lol
[08:17:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i just found a torch with 7 near me i think i might be able to get it for $50 lol
[08:18:04] <uGoMobi> good deal
[08:18:09] <arschmitz> found a curve with 7 for $30
[08:18:20] <uGoMobi> SOLD
[08:18:32] <arschmitz> lol
[08:18:36] <uGoMobi> as long as the browser works
[08:18:49] <arschmitz> yup both "say" they are fully functional
[08:20:23] <arschmitz> though i also found a htc incredible with 4.0 and a curve 8340 for $80 for the pair
[08:20:26] <uGoMobi> looking at a dutch used product site now
[08:21:11] <uGoMobi> problem with used is that often there is no receipt
[08:21:18] <arschmitz> yup
[08:21:32] <uGoMobi> so I can't buy on company name
[08:21:43] <arschmitz> why not get them t owrite you out a recipt?
[08:22:14] <uGoMobi> well maybe that's possible
[08:22:23] <uGoMobi> don't know the rules exactly
[08:22:46] <arschmitz> yeah i know in the US you could do it
[08:22:50] <uGoMobi> I could just go to someone and ask him to write a receipt for something i don't actually buy
[08:22:59] <uGoMobi> and reduce it from income as costs
[08:23:01] <arschmitz> very true
[08:23:14] <uGoMobi> so there are some rules :)
[08:23:31] <arschmitz> in the us a hand written recipte for a privte sale like that is fine for taxes
[08:23:48] <arschmitz> if they were ever to audit you they would just go ask the person and probably ask to see the device
[08:23:51] <uGoMobi> ok, hope it is the same here
[08:24:10] <uGoMobi> 50 euro for a curve with BB7
[08:24:19] <arschmitz> ouch
[08:24:23] <uGoMobi> better than 175 euro for a new one
[08:24:26] <arschmitz> can get them a lot cheaper here
[08:24:27] <arschmitz> yes
[08:25:02] <uGoMobi> I bought that iPad retina for 500 euro and all i do with it is testing on the browser
[08:25:22] <uGoMobi> so a used one probably does the trick as well :/
[08:25:24] <arschmitz> thats actually not as bad as i thought the exchange rate is better then i thought
[08:25:41] <arschmitz> still cheaper here though
[08:25:57] <uGoMobi> yeah I know
[08:26:35] <uGoMobi> I think rate is 1.35 or something at the moment
[08:26:49] <arschmitz> around there
[08:27:02] <arschmitz> 50 euro is 67.82usd according to google right now
[08:27:09] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[08:27:32] <arschmitz> which is within pennys of 1.35
[08:27:43] <uGoMobi> :)
[09:02:49] <mspisars> does jQm 1.2.0 no support jQuery 1.9.0?
[09:02:55] <mspisars> does jQm 1.2.0 not support jQuery 1.9.0?
[09:08:23] <arschmitz> mspisars: no it does not since 1.9 did not exist then
[09:08:56] <mspisars> will there be a 1.2.1 sometime soon?
[09:09:10] <arschmitz> there will be indeed
[09:09:18] <arschmitz> but cant say exactly how soon
[09:10:42] <arschmitz> mspisars: it wont be until after 1.3 
[09:11:32] <mspisars> arschmitz: thanks. that helps with my upgrade timeline.
[09:11:57] <arschmitz> mspisars: you can also checkout the jQuery migrate plugin meanwhile
[09:12:30] <mspisars> 1.3 fully supports 1.9 though right?
[09:12:36] <arschmitz> yup
[09:12:41] <mspisars> i can wait for 1.9 if 1.3 covers it.
[09:12:53] <arschmitz> not the beta but the rc next week will
[09:13:02] <mspisars> nice
[09:25:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you have a PhoneGap app on Android it will always run in WebView, right?
[09:25:13] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5561#issuecomment-12950819
[09:52:48] <arschmitz> yes
[09:53:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: phone gap is always webview
[09:53:55] <uGoMobi> thanks, just double checking
[09:55:03] <uGoMobi> the person that submitted that issue was talking about Chrome
[09:55:56] <uGoMobi> but I think he/she is kinda new to app development
[09:57:29] <RWhitbeck> won't be able to attend the meeting today.  Have a call at that time.

[10:27:45] <uGoMobi> johnbender: can you see why this is? ^^
[10:28:24] <uGoMobi> Latest build on Jenkins are fine http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/
[10:29:04] <uGoMobi> or is that link not pointing to this build?
[10:30:07] <johnbender> uGoMobi: no it's up on the cdn
[10:30:12] <johnbender> hmm
[10:30:18] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[10:30:31] <toddmparker> hey all -  just created an agenda for today's meeting
[10:30:32] <toddmparker> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oFD0UqA4zwntGhAVM07hAM1Y9NRyZwGlCvXcy2eaGC8/edit#
[10:31:33] <uGoMobi> johnbender: is this the one linking to latest on Jenkings? http://jquerymobile.com/test/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.css
[10:31:44] <uGoMobi> that one is up to date
[10:31:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it looks like there's an issue with the cdn reload
[10:32:02] <johnbender> gnarf: http://code.origin.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.css?reload
[10:32:06] <johnbender> I get a 500 :(
[10:32:11] <uGoMobi> aii
[10:37:01] <uGoMobi> thanks for looking into it johnbender and gnarf 
[10:37:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you might just have to wait
[10:38:04] <uGoMobi> johnbender: no problem, I can use http://jquerymobile.com/test/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.css
[10:47:04] <gnarf> johnbender: hrm
[10:47:18] <gnarf> seems the reloader is broken somehow
[10:47:19] <gnarf> looking
[10:47:28] <johnbender> gnarf: thanks much sir!
[10:51:44] <agcolom> toddmparker: I'm going to be having quick dinner. Can my update be in 30min or later, please? 
[10:53:36] <gnarf> johnbender: i think there might be something wrong with edgecast atm?
[10:53:37] <gnarf> [31-Jan-2013 18:51:06 UTC] PHP Fatal error:  SOAP-ERROR: Parsing WSDL: Couldn't load from 'http://api.edgecast.com/v1/MediaManager.asmx?WSDL' : failed to load external entity "http://api.edgecast.com/v1/MediaManager.asmx?WSDL" 
[10:54:24] <toddmparker> agcolom: sure
[10:54:38] <agcolom> thank you :-)
[10:57:08] <Wilto> Thanks for the .Net Mag question, agcolom. Yours was refreshingly sane compared to almost all the others.
[10:57:41] <agcolom> Wilto: you're welcome :-) I could not not have a question for you :-)
[10:57:54] <agcolom> (and I really wanted JQM to be mentioned :-) )
[10:57:57] <Wilto> Kinda glad “what’s your favorite Pokémon” didn’t make the final cut.
[10:58:06] <Wilto> (Alakazam.)
[10:58:11] <agcolom> so my question is in?
[10:58:13] <gseguin> :)
[10:58:22] <Wilto> Yes indeed!
[10:58:29] <agcolom> whoohoo!!!! 
[10:59:02] <Wilto> Also a question about Windows 8 native apps and a “who would win in a fight” involving Horse_ebooks.
[10:59:06] <agcolom> btw Congrats for getting the interview! That's is so excellent!
[10:59:09] <Wilto> So. This should be interesting.
[10:59:12] <Wilto> Thanks!
[10:59:46] <agcolom> Now I'll have to buy a paper copy!
[11:00:13] <agcolom> Can you get it in the US or would you like me to send you a paper copy? 
[11:00:45] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, I think we got it here.
[11:01:02] <Wilto> Man, yeah, I uh didn’t even think of the fact that my grimy ol’ mug was gonna be in an actual paper magazine.
[11:01:05] <Wilto> Wild.
[11:01:53] <agcolom> :-) just let me know if you want one and you can't get one... I can't wait to see that ;-)
[11:03:51] <gseguin> To the meeting room?
[11:03:58] <toddmparker> yes!
[11:05:35] <gnarf> johnbender: i'm not sure who or where to complain about this 
[11:05:51] <johnbender> gnarf: neither am I
[11:06:02] <gnarf> I guess I'll e-mail chris
[11:06:08] <johnbender> gnarf: I assume MT is our CDN?
[11:06:21] <gnarf> we use MT's edgecast service
[11:06:23] <gnarf> they rebundle
[11:06:28] <gnarf> edgecast is the actual CDN
[11:06:31] <gnarf> provided by MT
[11:07:09] <gnarf> so no login for the support 
[11:07:11] <gnarf> on edgecast
[11:10:15] <gnarf> johnbender: email sent
[11:10:20] <gnarf> johnbender: cross fingers i guess
[11:10:32] <johnbender> gnarf: it's not critical or anything so yah
[11:10:51] <gnarf> kinda is, could cause issues with CI builds
[11:10:56] <gnarf> but yeah
[11:10:57] <gnarf> :)
[11:16:50] <johnbender> gnarf: sorry, it's not critical for us
[11:17:02] <johnbender> *for us* being the key there

[12:31:01] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I can reproduce the blink with the swipe to open panel demo
[12:31:16] <uGoMobi> makes it easier to work on a fix
[12:33:10] <agcolom> so what is web-ui-fw? (seems like I've missed something major)
[12:33:26] <toddmparker> man, seeing the meeting notes shows just how much stuff gets done each week…feels good
[12:33:49] <toddmparker> agcolom: that is the intel/tizen ui library based on jQM
[12:33:56] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ is part of that
[12:34:17] <agcolom> oh, cool! seems very nice
[12:34:44] <agcolom> so is it like an extension to JQM?
[12:34:59] <arschmitz> agcolom: nix is working hard on making it that
[12:35:36] <agcolom> the date/time picker is really nice!
[12:36:52] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: are you around?
[12:38:38] <RThompson> agcolom: have you worked with panels much
[12:40:13] <agcolom> RThompson: no, not much..
[12:41:20] <arschmitz> RThompson: do you have a question about panels?
[12:41:22] <RThompson> I like what they talked about 
[12:41:38] <gseguin> johnbender: did you see which test suites are still failing for me?
[12:41:56] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I saw the note on that
[12:42:02] <johnbender> gseguin: sequence tests?
[12:42:10] <gseguin> yeah
[12:42:47] <gseguin> they fail in the browser as well
[12:42:49] <RThompson> arschmitz: appling a css3 animation to the panel
[12:43:00] <gseguin> johnbender: so it's not a PhantomJS issue
[12:43:35] <johnbender> gseguin: I suppose it could be but the one I fixed manifested for all redirect based tests
[12:45:35] <arschmitz> RThompson: uGoMobi: is the person for that
[12:46:17] <uGoMobi> panel animation?
[12:46:43] <uGoMobi> what's your question RThompson 
[12:46:43] <uGoMobi> ?
[12:48:03] <RThompson> uGoMobi: can a css3 animation apply to a panel popup?
[12:48:45] <uGoMobi> RThompson: are you talking about new panel widget http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/panels/index.html
[12:49:02] <uGoMobi> or this example http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/popup-panels.html ?
[12:49:08] <RThompson> uGoMobi: yep
[12:49:34] <uGoMobi> the former?
[12:49:56] <RThompson> uGoMobi: cool let me check it now
[12:50:06] <uGoMobi> the panel has a CSS animation
[12:50:24] <uGoMobi> but only if the browser supports transform3d
[12:50:44] <RThompson> uGoMobi: I'm thinking custom
[12:51:13] <RThompson> uGoMobi:but u Got it
[12:51:13] <uGoMobi> RThompson: you mean other animation than slide?
[12:51:47] <RThompson> uGoMobi: yep
[12:52:31] <uGoMobi> well you could override the transforms
[12:53:05] <uGoMobi> or use option classes to set other classes so the transforms that we added in the framework don't apply
[12:53:09] <uGoMobi> but...
[12:53:37] <uGoMobi> it took us 3 re-factors to get the transitions work nicely on all supported platforms
[12:54:15] <RThompson> uGoMobi: as an added stylesheet or use the main?
[12:54:21] <uGoMobi> so make sure you have the devices to test your custom animation
[12:55:12] <uGoMobi> depends what suits you
[12:55:32] <uGoMobi> if you create your own build you can edit in the framework CSS
[12:55:38] <RThompson> uGoMobi: true thx
[12:55:55] <uGoMobi> if you just load the library from the CDN you can add your own stylesheet with custom CSS
[12:56:18] <RThompson> uGoMobi: CDN sounds best
[12:56:54] <uGoMobi> but I wouldn't recommend using a custom transition
[12:57:18] <uGoMobi> I think you will run into a lot of issues
[12:57:52] <uGoMobi> I don't know what content should go in the panel... maybe popup is a better solution
[12:58:57] <RThompson> uGoMobi: really let me test that thx
[12:59:08] <uGoMobi> RThompson: sure np
[12:59:58] <uGoMobi> RThompson: just in case you are interested in that popup panel example... there are issue with that one on an iPad :(
[14:04:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What's up?
[14:12:17] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: hi (sorry for the delay)
[14:12:26] <_|Nix|_> D0000d! WTF?! Major disaster in Android 2.3.5 ... when you focus in on one of the inputs of the form popup, it scrolls down like mad!
[14:12:42] <agcolom> web-ui-fw is very nice.
[14:13:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, but it was done very differently from jQM. We're trying to change that to make it as close as possible.
[14:13:18] <agcolom> oh, ok...
[14:13:19] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, we want to add the XML-based docs as well.
[14:13:37] <agcolom> I think I saw a possible typo (but not 100% sure).. I need to find it again!
[14:13:49] <agcolom> oh, nice!
[14:13:56] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I have pointed Hyunsook to the github repo for api.jquerymobile.com, so she can reproduce it for our docs.
[14:14:36] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I told her that you're our API docs expert, so you're probably the best person to answer questions she might have.
[14:15:12] <agcolom> sure, that's no problem at all
[14:15:23] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I guess we'd have to reproduce some of the magic that goes on to turn the XML into a great site like api.jquerymobile.com
[14:16:02] <gseguin> johnbender: any objection to upgrade to qunit 1.11.0 ?
[14:16:37] <_|Nix|_> BTW: The Android 2.3.5 fsckage has been going on since at least 1.2.0 ...
[14:16:58] <agcolom> yes. you need the xsl file and there's wp template for all the css styling
[14:17:20] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Can you make the docs look as good locally as they do on api.jquerymobile.com?
[14:17:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: If so, what do you run?
[14:17:36] <agcolom> yes, I have a local repo...
[14:17:48] <agcolom> I run grunt deploy 
[14:17:56] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hmmm ... lemme try that ...
[14:18:29] <agcolom> adam took some notes to get the local setup... I'll see if i can find them
[14:18:44] <agcolom> (I was just follwing his instructions)
[14:19:40] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: on http://web-ui-fw.github.com/#calendarDemo is the title correct?
[14:20:00] <agcolom> or should it be TODOS?
[14:20:52] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: todons is a token that means we don't know what our namespace will be, so it's todons ...
[14:21:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: IE, determining our namespace (NS) is one of our TODO items.
[14:21:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, like, $.?????.datetimepicker
[14:21:36] <agcolom> oh, ok:-)
[14:21:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: In the new version of the library, it's gonna be mobile.
[14:22:03] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, we're going to build it as an extension to jQM.
[14:22:30] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: As of master, the task build-xml-entries fails.
[14:22:30] <agcolom> that is excellent!
[14:22:44] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I'm getting a lot of XInclude errors.
[14:22:53] <agcolom> try npm install
[14:22:56] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: could not load includes/core-extension-desc.xml
[14:23:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I did.
[14:23:51] <agcolom> what do you have in package.json?
[14:23:52] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I guess that one file is missing from the repo or something ...
[14:24:06] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What are you looking for?
[14:24:40] <agcolom> let me check...
[14:25:16] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Do you have a file called core-extension-desc.xml in your repo? I don't, and that's the one it's looking for.
[14:25:57] <agcolom> I'll have a look...
[14:27:36] <agcolom> no I don't
[14:28:03] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK, weird ... then there's something different about my setup. I'll try git clean and then npm install ...
[14:29:03] <agcolom> ok, let me know how you get on...
[14:33:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Well, not so well, actually. I did a git clean -x -d -f to get rid of every file that does not belong to the repo, and now I can't build anything, because config.json is missing.
[14:33:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK, reading the README helps :)
[14:34:55] <gseguin> arschmitz: for the demos
[14:35:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK, after copying config-sample.json over to config.json, I'm in the same place - that file is missing.
[14:35:19] <arschmitz> gseguin: yes?
[14:35:20] <gseguin> the current build already does a replace of /js/ by /js/jquery.mobile.js
[14:35:31] <gseguin> is there something else that needs to be done?
[14:35:33] <arschmitz> gseguin thats not what i was talking about in meeting
[14:35:48] <gseguin> sorry then I misunderstodd
[14:35:50] <arschmitz> remember the including the html files we wre using the php include for
[14:36:03] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: so you've found the readme and you still have the pb?
[14:36:04] <arschmitz> for the nav menu
[14:36:16] <gseguin> can you give me a file pointer?
[14:36:22] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yep. The same problem I had before I did a git clean ...
[14:36:36] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Maybe ajpiano can help ...
[14:36:56] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Can you help me track down an API build failure?
[14:37:22] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: I'm getting XInclude error : could not load includes/core-extension-desc.xml, and no fallback was found when trying to build api.jquerymobile.com locally ...
[14:37:29] <arschmitz> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/docs/demos/nav.html this is included in every page using a php include();
[14:37:35] <arschmitz> in the demos
[14:37:49] <arschmitz> we would like that to just be part of the flat file in the download
[14:37:55] <gseguin> gotcha
[14:38:17] <ajpiano> _|Nix|_: perhaps?
[14:38:21] <gseguin> so when I build I just replace the include by the content of the included file
[14:38:28] <ajpiano> do you have libxml2 and libxslt installed properly?
[14:38:33] <arschmitz> exactly
[14:38:39] <gseguin> easy peasy!
[14:38:44] <arschmitz> cool
[14:38:48] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Aaah, good point. Do I need the -dev packages as well?
[14:38:52] <gseguin> alright on to building the demos now
[14:38:55] <ajpiano> i don't think so
[14:39:16] <arschmitz> gesguin awesome: 
[14:39:17] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: I already have them installed :(
[14:39:46] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: I'll try the -dev packages as well ... *shrug*
[14:40:46] <ajpiano> hrm _|Nix|_ :/ what os are you on
[14:40:48] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Still no dice ... is there maybe some specific language or stylesheet or whatever those are called that needs to be installed?
[14:40:54] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Fedora 18
[14:41:08] <ajpiano> _|Nix|_: is xmllint ans xsltproc in your path
[14:41:14] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: just did a pull and there's an error in an entry made on panels... I'll fix that now, but I don't think it's what you're experiencing...
[14:41:30] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Nono, I fixed that.
[14:41:45] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Should I install wordpress?
[14:42:03] <ajpiano> if you want to deploy those built files anywhere, then yes
[14:42:36] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: will you push that fix to panels or should I do it?
[14:42:42] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Well, I just want to be able to behold the result on my local server ... I guess that meansy yes.
[14:42:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: You better do it.
[14:42:50] <ajpiano> yes, without wordpress there is no local server
[14:42:58] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: ok, will do now
[14:43:00] <ajpiano> _|Nix|_: you don't just "install wordpress" though
[14:43:09] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: I figured not ...
[14:43:11] <ajpiano> github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content
[14:43:15] <ajpiano> you just follow those instructions
[14:43:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: want to talk syntax highlighting in the faq tomorrow?
[14:44:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure, I'll be around
[14:44:18] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Egads! I need mysql>
[14:44:19] <_|Nix|_> ?
[14:44:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: gseguin : about the demos nav menu... there is one thing we have to look at first
[14:44:31] <ajpiano> what do you reckon wordpress runs on :)
[14:44:35] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Well, I guess wordpress will set that up for me though ...
[14:44:54] <ajpiano> you need to like, have mysql elsewise though,
[14:45:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: gseguin : we use relative path for links but the nav menu is included at different levels in the folder tree
[14:45:08] <ajpiano> wordpress doesn't make it appear
[14:45:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmmm we need to figure that out somehow
[14:45:37] <uGoMobi> yeah we do
[14:45:44] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/_bo4EQ
[14:45:45] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14d11dfd4 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: added missing closing p tag in panel.xml
[14:46:13] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: You're right. It doesn't even depend on it ... 
[14:46:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill put some thought into it tonight i know how to do it with php but not sure how to make it work for builder
[14:46:38] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ah that was my bad... thanks for fixing the </p>
[14:47:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: exactly, same here
[14:48:31] <agcolom> uGoMobi: no problem :-) that was an easy one :-)
[14:48:40] <uGoMobi> :)
[15:11:17] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: I'm following those instructions, but I'm not sure the structure inside my DocumentRoot is correct. I have two directories there: wordpress and jquery-wp-content
[15:11:30] <ajpiano> that is indeed incorrect
[15:11:37] <ajpiano> jquery-wp-content should be inside of wordpress
[15:11:43] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: OK.
[15:11:53] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: That's not very clear from step 4.
[15:11:56] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: That's not very clear from step 3.
[15:12:12] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: It says to clone jquery-wp-content "into place".
[15:12:28] <ajpiano> yeah, it's kind of vague i suppose
[15:12:41] <ajpiano> it shows it next to index.php, and files that are *inside* of wordpress
[15:13:19] <ajpiano> but it could say like, "inside of the directory where you've put WordPress" though
[15:15:17] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Does wordpress need to have write access to /wordpress?
[15:15:36] <ajpiano> i do belivee so
[15:15:50] <ajpiano> yeah that's step 6
[15:21:37] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: OK. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the VirtualHost is working, because after I restart apache and go to local.jquery.com I get the front page of my regular server ...
[15:22:12] <ajpiano> _|Nix|_: do you dev on localhost
[15:22:16] <ajpiano> or is it a vm or something
[15:22:47] <ajpiano> local.jquery.com redirects to 127.0.0.1, so if your server is somewhere else, that could be the issue
[15:23:58] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: It's localhost.
[15:24:15] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: No, the alternate documentroot isn't working.
[15:24:28] <ajpiano> hmm  :/
[15:24:32] <ajpiano> i have never set this up on linux
[15:24:44] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: My main documentroot is /var/www/html, but for the virtualhost it's /var/www/jquery ...
[15:24:59] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: VirtualHost stuff is tricky ...
[15:25:19] <ajpiano> yeah, this stuff isn't really my cup of tea either, i just get it working :)
[15:25:26] <ajpiano> as best i can
[15:25:29] <ajpiano> and then i ask gnarf :p
[15:28:43] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: It's actually working, but I have to go to http://local.jquery.com/wordpress not http://local.jquery.com/
[15:29:03] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: When unzipping wordpress, I think the README should say to unzip it into the documentroot
[15:30:59] <ajpiano> ohhh
[15:31:00] <ajpiano> yeah
[15:31:03] <ajpiano> that's the trick
[15:31:08] <ajpiano> you have to.. do that ^^
[15:31:26] <ajpiano> or rather, that whatever you point your vhost to should
[15:31:30] <ajpiano> *be* the wordpress directory
[15:38:48] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: I seem to be making progress ... installing wordpress is a beast. My HDD has been churning continuously for minutes now ...
[15:38:49] <ajpiano> whaaat
[15:38:49] <ajpiano> it usually takes like
[15:38:49] <ajpiano> less than a minute
[15:38:49] <ajpiano> and it definitely shouldn't be churning up cpu
[15:38:49] <ajpiano> it's like, creating a bunch of empty sql tables
[15:38:49] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Not the CPU ... the HDD ...
[15:38:49] <ajpiano> that makes even less sense!
[15:38:50] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: I hope the http request doesn't time out. I clicked on Install WordPress, and it says waiting for local.jquery.com ...
[15:38:50] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: OK, it's done.
[15:38:50] <ajpiano> in my experience it takes just a moment longer than the point where you're like "ok, this seems to be taking a while"
[15:38:50] <ajpiano> :p
[15:38:50] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: OK, so I logged in and there's a dashboard and everything ...
[15:38:50] <ajpiano> blammo
[15:38:50] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Am I ready to grunt deploy?
[15:38:50] <ajpiano> you should be
[15:38:50] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: OK. Here goes nothing.
[15:38:50] <ajpiano> _|Nix|_: now, i don't reckon that installing wordpress
[15:38:51] <ajpiano> will have fixed the earlier issue :p
[15:38:51] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Oh ... man ...
[15:38:51] <ajpiano> it just means that when that is resolved, it will have somewhere to deploy to :p
[15:38:51] <_|Nix|_> Right ... 
[15:38:51] <ajpiano> _|Nix|_: if you want to prove that this setup works fine in principle though first, you can deploy jquerymobile.com
[15:38:51] <ajpiano> it has no xml processing
[15:38:51] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: OK. 
[15:38:51] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Lemme guess ... need to clone that too ...
[15:38:51] <ajpiano> yup
[15:40:22] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: OK, I may have some permission problems ...
[15:40:41] <ajpiano> :/
[15:43:54] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: OK. A few chmod g+w later it works.
[15:44:04] <ajpiano> hey now
[15:44:49] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Well, I'll be darned ... looks just like the real thing ...
[15:44:54] <ajpiano> woo
[15:45:04] <ajpiano> you deployed jquerymobile successfully?
[15:45:08] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Yep.
[15:45:13] <ajpiano> awesome!
[15:45:17] <_|Nix|_> Indeed ...
[15:45:23] <ajpiano> ok so let's see if we can get to the bottom of the api issue
[15:50:45] <ajpiano> wasn't sure if you answered whether xmllint ans xsltproc in your path
[15:50:45] <ajpiano> ?
[15:50:45] <_|Nix|_> They're in my path.
[15:50:45] <ajpiano> hrmlmmkm
[15:50:46] <ajpiano> the xml deps on linux is one of the things about this process i do not know very much about
[15:50:46] <ajpiano> let me see what happens if i build api.jquerymobile.locally
[15:50:47] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: I've tried to check if any package provides includes/core-extension-desc.xml, but none seems to.
[15:50:48] <ajpiano> works fine here still so hmm
[15:50:48] <ajpiano> yeah qu'est-ce que c'est this thing
[15:50:48] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ...
[15:51:16] <ajpiano> _|Nix|_: can you humor me and try to deploy the jqueryui api docs
[15:51:20] <ajpiano> one more clone :p
[15:51:31] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: I've done a --force ...
[15:51:41] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Stuff is getting deployed.
[15:51:46] <ajpiano> oh interesting
[15:51:56] <ajpiano> maybe you have some cruft in your api.jquerymobile.com repo?
[15:51:56] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: posts are also getting created.
[15:52:08] <ajpiano> how fresh is that checkout?
[15:52:08] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Might be the case ...
[15:52:23] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: I just did a pull and a git clean -x -d -f -f
[15:52:34] <ajpiano> hmm bizarre then
[15:52:58] <_|Nix|_> Lots of stuff is getting published - maybe that's not a fatal error.
[15:53:33] <ajpiano> yeah, perhaps it isn't
[15:53:35] <gnarf> all sorted?
[15:53:41] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Looking good ... *shrug*
[15:53:52] <ajpiano> yea that's still an annoying failure
[15:53:54] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Yeah, except for one weird Xinclude error ...
[15:54:00] <ajpiano> and it will prevent you from using `grunt watch`
[15:54:04] <ajpiano> which would be nice for you to have :)
[15:54:24] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Well, I don't do a lot of work with the API docs so I'm not too worried ...
[15:54:48] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: warning: failed to load external entity "includes/core-extension-desc.xml"
[15:54:53] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Followed by
[15:55:02] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: entries/orientationchange.xml:14: element include: XInclude error : could not load includes/core-extension-desc.xml, and no fallback was found
[15:55:15] <gnarf> with api?
[15:55:20] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: jquerymobile
[15:55:33] <gnarf> server error or grunt?
[15:55:36] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: I'm thinking maybe I'm missing a package
[15:55:40] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: grunt
[15:55:50] <gnarf> you need some xslt stuff
[15:55:54] <gnarf> but like
[15:55:57] <gnarf> im not sure
[15:56:00] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: That's what I figured.
[15:56:00] <gnarf> each repo is different
[15:56:32] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: I did yum whatprovides */core-extension-desc.xml and no package seems to provide that file.
[15:56:46] <gnarf> that sounds like an include
[15:56:51] <gnarf> that should be in your repo
[15:57:06] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: agcolom doesn't have it in hers either, and it builds fine for her.
[15:57:30] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Do you have a file called core-extension-desc.xml in your copy of the api.jquerymobile.com repo?
[15:57:42] <gnarf> _|Nix|_:   package{[ "xsltproc", "libxml2-utils" ]: ensure => present } 
[15:57:46] <gnarf> on debian
[15:58:01] <ajpiano> _|Nix|_: nope
[15:59:30] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: I have no separate libxml2-utils package ...
[15:59:52] <gnarf> ?g libxml2-utils
[15:59:55] <bot-t> gnarf, Debian -- Details of package libxml2-utils in sid - http://packages.debian.org/sid/libxml2-utils
[16:00:14] <gnarf> xmllint
[16:00:25] <gnarf> but like
[16:00:27] <gnarf> i dunno
[16:00:42] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: I already have xmllint ...
[16:00:56] <_|Nix|_> Well, anyway, I can live with it ...
[16:01:11] <_|Nix|_> ... and now I have all the cool wordpress setup ...
[16:01:18] <_|Nix|_> ... so, yaaay!
[16:01:36] <ajpiano> yay _|Nix|_
[16:01:56] <ajpiano> well i would suggest you have grunt watch for editing files so you don't have to grunt every time you make a change, but it's up to you
