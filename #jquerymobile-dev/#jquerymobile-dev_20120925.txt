[01:38:53] <uGoMobi> good morning all

[05:55:48] <uGoMobi> Sometimes it is really hard to do things right at once ^^^
[06:15:59] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: nice job closing those
[06:16:22] <toddmparker_> i usually need two commits to get things right
[06:16:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: our friend you mean?
[06:17:00] <toddmparker_> i do
[06:17:05] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:17:10] <toddmparker_> birdman
[06:17:33] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:22:52] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I edited the contributing guidelines. Do you mind reviewing it when you have time?
[06:24:23] <uGoMobi> the idea was to explain a bit more why we need a test page and in a JS Bin template
[06:25:44] <uGoMobi> hopefully people actually provide a test page right away  when they understand the reason why
[06:55:07] <toddmparker_> that's a great idea and the new copy looks great
[06:55:16] <toddmparker_> wish we could add that as a template
[07:32:51] <Wilto> Whatâ€™s good, fam?
[07:35:34] <_|Nix|_> Just waiting for the release here ...
[07:58:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: since you are just waiting anyway... do you have a Nokia on which you can test this issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5005
[08:00:20] <_|Nix|_> I have a Csomething something.
[08:00:24] <_|Nix|_> I'll check it out.
[08:01:20] <uGoMobi> thanks
[08:05:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know see that we don't support the Symbian version that guy tested on
[08:07:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but would be nice to know if it works on a Symbian version that we do support
[08:14:59] <uGoMobi> s/know/now/
[08:19:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: small fix that _has_ to go in before the release :(
[08:39:37] <toddmparker_> morning johnbender
[08:40:25] <toddmparker_> wait...you want to make a code change between RC and final?
[08:40:31] <toddmparker_> gonna savor this....ahhh
[08:40:38] <toddmparker_> ok, what is it?
[08:40:47] <toddmparker_> hey kinblas
[08:40:55] <agcolom> Hey all :-)
[08:41:05] <toddmparker_> hi agcolom
[08:41:18] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[08:41:34] <agcolom> toddmparker_: I should have popups finished by Thursday...
[08:41:48] <toddmparker_> awesome
[08:42:12] <agcolom> I'm visit my 5th potential secondary school tonight!
[08:42:16] <toddmparker_> so i'm beginning to really like the idea of having the current docs and demos be mostly demos with some high level docs
[08:42:30] <agcolom> toddmparker_: sounds good!
[08:42:41] <toddmparker_> so we and build more cool stuff that is customized and shows people how to build things right
[08:42:54] <toddmparker_> what agcolom is working on will serve as the docs
[08:43:00] <toddmparker_> is MauriceG in the house?
[08:43:19] <toddmparker_> i need to work on the final blog post and i'm hoping he can assemble a massive changelog for 1.2
[08:44:04] <agcolom> uGoMobi: toddmparker_ I rediscovered the popup panel example yesterday! It's really really nice!
[08:44:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: do we want 1.2 final to support core 1.8.2?
[08:44:33] <toddmparker_> we should if we can
[08:45:11] <toddmparker_> let's drop that into master after we doa  final test run
[08:45:15] <toddmparker_> any volunteers?
[08:45:17] <toddmparker_> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/09/20/jquery-1-8-2-released/
[08:48:12] <uGoMobi> why drop it in master after we do a final test run?
[08:48:27] <agcolom> toddmparker_: when are you thinking of releasing final?
[08:51:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's a security fix :/
[08:52:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the uri autedecoding issue again
[08:53:49] <toddmparker_> was thinking we'd release late this week?
[08:53:56] <toddmparker_> but we can wait if needed
[08:54:09] <toddmparker_> johnbender: DAMMIT H4K0RZ
[08:54:31] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: was thinking that we should just run our test suite to make sure there's no flags
[08:54:40] <toddmparker_> we're on 1.8.1 in master now, right?
[08:54:46] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:54:56] <agcolom> toddmparker_: ok, no problem, just let me know if and when you need help with the final docs editing...
[08:55:15] <agcolom> johnbender: Hi! Hope you are feeling a bit better?
[08:55:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we run it against git every day
[08:55:50] <toddmparker_> just being cautious. guess we can just toss 'er in then
[08:56:40] <uGoMobi> I can drop it in local and run all unit tests
[09:00:35] <agcolom> ok, I'm off to school visit... catch you later...
[09:07:19] <toddmparker_> bye agcolom
[09:07:27] <toddmparker_> should i drop in 1.8.2?
[09:07:54] <uGoMobi> running full test now
[09:10:41] <uGoMobi> johnbender: would it be possible to have a "run all tests" link at the /tests/unit index page?
[09:10:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: no
[09:11:04] <johnbender> the iframes don't play well with our tests
[09:11:05] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok
[09:11:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: :(
[09:11:15] <johnbender> best thing to do is use phantom
[09:11:17] <uGoMobi> I understand
[09:11:29] <uGoMobi> I am running the tests on phantomjs now
[09:11:34] <johnbender> cool
[09:11:42] <uGoMobi> but also wanted to run on FF
[09:11:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah, at some point we won't have to
[09:12:09] <johnbender> that'll be testswarm's job
[09:12:20] <johnbender> once I can figure out the gdamn back button issue in browserstacks vms :(
[09:12:34] <uGoMobi> yeah
[09:13:55] <uGoMobi> before submitting a fix you can just run the applicable tests, but in some cases it would be handy if you could just run them all
[09:14:25] <uGoMobi> on a specific browser
[09:19:19] <uGoMobi> all tests are ok on phantomjs when testing with core 1.8.2
[09:29:45] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_ johnbender : let me know if you want me to push core 1.8.2 to master
[09:52:05] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: if you don't mind...heading into a meeting
[10:01:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: zomg
[10:01:50] <johnbender> depending on what browser you are in
[10:02:14] <johnbender> location.hash will behave differently
[10:02:19] <johnbender> wait
[10:02:21] <johnbender> wait
[10:02:23] <johnbender> wait
[10:02:30] <toddmparker_> wait?
[10:02:30] <johnbender> I'll be back with more
[10:02:33] <johnbender> double checking
[10:02:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I saw some odd shit with IE earlier
[10:02:47] <johnbender> I could be wrong
[10:02:51] <toddmparker_> crackin' me up today johnbender
[10:03:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: there is at least a difference between how we handle location.hash
[10:03:06] <johnbender> and how browsers handle it
[10:03:08] <johnbender> so
[10:03:15] <johnbender> here's one tid bit of fun
[10:03:23] <johnbender> I imagine many people are aware of this
[10:03:30] <johnbender> for a url with an empty hash
[10:03:35] <johnbender> http://foo.com/#
[10:03:39] <johnbender> location.hash == ""
[10:03:50] <johnbender> http://foo.com/#foo
[10:03:56] <johnbender> location.hash == "#foo"
[10:03:57] <johnbender> :/
[10:03:59] <johnbender> wtf
[10:04:15] <toddmparker_> not "foo"
[10:04:20] <johnbender> well
[10:04:22] <johnbender> right
[10:04:30] <johnbender> or "#" in the case of an empty hash
[10:04:39] <johnbender> it might be that the spec is ambigous
[10:04:43] <toddmparker_> i see
[10:04:47] <johnbender> or that # without anything following it isn't actually a hash
[10:04:52] <johnbender> it's just a nothing ?
[10:04:55] <johnbender> no idea
[10:04:56] <johnbender> anyway
[10:04:59] <johnbender> dealing with that now :/
[10:05:04] <johnbender> sort of
[10:05:08] <toddmparker_> ok, good luck
[10:18:23] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: "I can not explain in detail. Since it is very difficult to be shown into a drawing. If you want to try it, please make an application using WebWorks and installed as native applications blackberry. Then it would look like I was saying."
[10:18:40] <toddmparker_> not good enough people
[10:18:48] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yeah I just saw that

[13:21:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: #5005 is not reproducible on my Nokia C7 ... not sure where to check what version of what it's running.
[13:22:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks for testing
[13:23:25] <uGoMobi> I think the C7 is symbian^3
[13:23:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It says "This product is based on Symbian^3."
[13:23:33] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, whatever that is.
[13:23:56] <_|Nix|_> I dunno the first thing about Symbian.
[13:24:20] <uGoMobi> those Symbian versions are so confusing
[13:24:31] <uGoMobi> I don't even try to remember
[13:25:04] <uGoMobi> anyway, conclusion is that it works :)
[13:25:36] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[13:25:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Ping!
[13:26:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: pong
[13:26:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hey!
[13:27:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was thinking about writing some nav sequence unit tests. Like page1 -> dialog -> page2, page1 -> dialog -> popup -> page2, etc.
[13:27:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and then using that redirect to test using all kinds of funky deep-link URLs.
[13:28:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Not sure if this should go in before 1.2 or whether we should wait, or do it at all.
[13:28:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if it's just tests then go for it
[13:28:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you find corner cases we don't support then log them as issues
[13:28:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, based on that functional test I added recently.
[13:29:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. Will do.
[13:29:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks for doing that, it'll make my life easier during the refactor
[13:29:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I figured they might help you shake down a rewrite.
[13:29:47] <johnbender> bingo
[13:29:56] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[13:30:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We might also want to move $.testHelper.detailedEventCascade out of tests/unit/popup into tests/jquery.testHelper.js ...
[13:31:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I find that pageSequence is not always the right way to go, and then I find myself using sequence, which is just timeouts, and so it takes an unnecessarily long time to test.
[13:32:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: sure
[13:32:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Should I put the tests under nav, or should I make a new subdirectory, like, say, tests/unit/navsequence?
[13:33:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'd move the one open-dialog-close-dialog test there as well.
[13:33:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if there are a bunch of individual pages used for redirects I would put them under a subdir of navigation
[13:33:34] <johnbender> tests/unit/navigation/initial-state/
[13:33:36] <johnbender> or something like that
[13:33:42] <johnbender> the glob will pick those up
[13:33:47] <johnbender> or should
[13:33:53] <_|Nix|_> OK, great! Wasn't sure about the glob.
[13:34:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: just make sure the file is *-test.html
[13:34:25] <johnbender> then the nesting shouldn't matter
[13:34:40] <_|Nix|_> *-tests.html, right?
[13:34:57] <johnbender> make sure to double check that in the output of `grunt config:test:pages`
[13:35:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes sorry
[13:35:05] <johnbender> -tests.html
[13:35:07] <johnbender> with an s
[13:35:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can a subdir of navigation have its own index.html?
[13:35:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that won't get picked up I don't think
[13:35:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: but if it's the target of a redirect it doesn't amtter
[13:35:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. NP.
[13:35:47] <johnbender> *matter
[13:36:01] * _|Nix|_ cracks his knuckles
[13:43:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/zMc6qA

[13:49:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think $.testHelper.asyncLoad may be hard-coded to include things from ../../../js ...
[13:49:20] <johnbender>  _|Nix|_ it is
[13:49:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it can load things from the current directory if you append .js
[13:50:06] <johnbender> it's then loading a file and not a module
[13:50:10] <johnbender> that's how we load the test files
[13:50:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I know, but I need to load dialog and page and stuff.
[13:50:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ?
[13:51:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: "widgets/page" ?
[13:51:49] <johnbender> not sure what you need
[13:52:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: $.testHelper.asyncLoad([ "widgets/dialog", "widgets/page", "widgets/page.sections" ], [jquery.mobile.init ], ["sequence_tests.js"] );
[13:52:35] <johnbender> that's what's tests/unit/dialog/index.html right?
[13:52:47] <johnbender> or similar too
[13:52:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, tests/unit/dialog/basic-tests.html, actually.
[13:53:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I git mv-ed that to tests/unit/navigation/sequence-tests, but all the non-.js stuff passed to asyncLoad is not off by a directory level.
[13:53:46] <_|Nix|_> s/not off/now off/
[13:53:57] <johnbender> ahh
[13:54:05] <johnbender> you can add an extra param to asyncLoad if you want
[13:54:11] <johnbender> to change the base js dir
[13:54:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was thinking if the type of any param is a string rather than an array, then that's a path to add to the search path.
[13:54:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: either way
[13:54:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Kinda like -I/usr/include/lib-major.minor
[13:55:42] <toddmparker_> BB10 theme is out!
[13:57:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: oh snap
[13:57:05] <johnbender> links?
[13:57:09] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/blackberry/jQueryMobile-BB10-Theme/blob/master/docs/README.md
[13:57:17] <toddmparker_> i don't see a live demo
[13:58:02] <johnbender> same
[14:15:56] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5005 aren't those unsupported platforms supposed to get a C-grade experience?
[14:17:11] <uGoMobi> sounds like they don't
[14:19:46] <johnbender> uGoMobi: is it possible the new support test is letting them through?
[14:20:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: nevermind he's using 1.1.0
[14:20:17] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I don't know
[14:23:33] <johnbender> uGoMobi: well if they are getting past the support test in 1.1.0 they must at least support mediaqueries
[14:23:38] <johnbender> or conditional comments
[14:23:41] <johnbender> that would be odd
[14:24:28] <uGoMobi> johnbender: that Nokia series 40 he is talking about doesn't support CSS3 or HTML5
[14:24:45] <uGoMobi> so I don't think it should pass any test :)
[14:25:25] <uGoMobi> Nokia browser for series 40 is a proxy browser
[14:26:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: maybe we can ask him to report the value of $.mobile.gradeA and it's constituent parts from 1.1.0
[14:26:12] <johnbender> $.support.mediaquery
[14:26:26] <johnbender> of $.mobile.browser.ie
[14:26:31] <johnbender> *$.mobile.browser.ie
[14:30:40] <uGoMobi> johnbender: sure, I will ask hi
[14:30:48] <uGoMobi> s/hi/him/
[14:31:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: seems like he might be monkeying with it himself but you never know
[14:47:56] <uGoMobi> johnbender: when I was looking at the support JS file I saw this...
[14:47:59] <uGoMobi> function boundingRect() {
[14:47:59] <uGoMobi> 	var div = document.createElement( "div" );
[14:47:59] <uGoMobi> 	return typeof div.getBoundingClientRect !== "undefined";
[14:47:59] <uGoMobi> }
[14:48:42] <uGoMobi> as from core 1.8.2 it will return {0,0} if getBoundingClientRect is not supported
[14:50:31] <uGoMobi> and in the gradeA function.... && ( $.support.boundingRect || $.fn.jquery.match(/1\.[0-7+]\.[0-9+]?/) !== null )
[14:51:35] <uGoMobi> Q: do BB5 and iOS still get C-grade when using core 1.8.2
[14:53:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: they should yes
[14:53:44] <johnbender> uGoMobi: or that's my understanding
[14:53:56] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[14:54:00] <johnbender> might want to clarify
[14:54:28] <uGoMobi> they should yes, but I am not sure if that's actually the case if I look at that code
[14:55:27] <uGoMobi> but I might misread that regex
[14:57:22] <uGoMobi> well actually that doesn't matter...  $.support.boundingRect will return true
[14:58:53] <uGoMobi> Wilto: can you take a look at this again? I think BB5 and iOS won't get C-grade with core 1.8.2
[15:07:08] <uGoMobi> Wilto: sorry, nevermind
[15:07:19] <uGoMobi> it works as expected
[15:08:41] <uGoMobi> I thought boundingRect() would return {0,0} but that is when you use offset()
[15:09:33] <uGoMobi> conclusion: I better go to bed ;)
[15:09:41] <uGoMobi> good night all!
[15:13:04] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper :-)
