[06:39:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: under 320 issues!
[06:39:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah great!!
[06:39:50] <uGoMobi> wanted to follow up on your comments but toddmparker beat me to it :)
[06:40:21] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah all of a sudden my email just started blowing up with him closing them
[06:42:08] <arschmitz> i actually got to actually close an issue this mornign ha ha
[06:42:15] <arschmitz> because i created it 5 months ago!
[06:42:45] <arschmitz> and at some point it got fixed
[07:12:25] <gseguin> mornin' all
[07:14:50] <gseguin> uGoMobi, toddmparker: ping
[07:15:04] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin!
[07:15:11] <gseguin> hey Jasper
[07:15:22] <gseguin> I'm looking at the PR that "fixes" https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5208
[07:15:52] <gseguin> I'm tempted to close as "won't fix"
[07:16:03] * uGoMobi is looking
[07:16:48] <gseguin> so basically he's expecting that we filter the nested LI
[07:17:24] <gseguin> when all we do is filter the direct children of the list based on their .text()
[07:17:32] <arschmitz> gseguin the nested list isnt even a listview!
[07:17:40] <arschmitz> its just a list
[07:18:27] <gseguin> well not only that but the children of the UL are DIVs not LIs
[07:18:43] <gseguin> which is weird anyway
[07:18:44] <arschmitz> hes not following the conventions in the docs AT ALL
[07:19:05] <gseguin> but I get his use case though
[07:20:28] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I agree on closing as won't fix
[07:20:51] <gseguin> I think at that point he's better off developing his own widget
[07:21:02] <gseguin> alright
[07:21:14] <gseguin> arschmitz?
[07:21:23] <toddmparker> morning
[07:21:28] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker
[07:21:28] <arschmitz> yeah im with closing as wont fix
[07:21:30] <gseguin> hey Todd
[07:21:47] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker
[07:21:58] <gseguin> alright that's +3 then
[07:22:17] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think we shouldn't support things like that because IMO it's bad UI
[07:22:42] <arschmitz> might have considdered his case more if he had even attempted to properly use the listview also
[07:24:26] <uGoMobi> what might be a nice alternative for our current nested listview is making the nested list a collapsible
[07:26:05] <uGoMobi> in that case you could create something like this in a proper way (2 nested lists) and maybe we can make the collapsed nested list expand when an item in it matches the filter
[07:29:30] <gseguin> uGoMobi: is that what you're saying: http://jsbin.com/ogexof/10/edit
[07:30:30] <gseguin> brb
[07:30:30] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah
[07:31:54] <uGoMobi> gseguin: just bit different styling
[07:36:23] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ogexof/14/edit
[07:36:33] <arschmitz> working example just how they want with current widget
[07:36:42] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/ogexof/11
[07:37:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ha ha mine filters too! :)
[07:37:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: now we just have to combine them :)
[07:38:37] <arschmitz> yeah i ditched the current collapsible and just modified a listview
[07:38:37] <uGoMobi> I messed up the padding on the LI's
[07:39:16] * gseguin looks
[07:41:02] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I am editing that JS Bin now
[07:42:20] <gseguin> ok
[08:03:37] <arschmitz> gseguin: uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/ogexof/18/
[08:04:13] <gseguin> nice!
[08:04:38] <arschmitz> i think thats exactly what the OP was looking for
[08:05:05] <uGoMobi> I was trying to do it without adding JS, using our collapsible widget
[08:05:08] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/ogexof/11/edit
[08:05:18] <uGoMobi> problem: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5016
[08:05:30] <uGoMobi> you get 3 filters because of event bubbling
[08:05:43] <arschmitz> yeah i think one toggle isnt bad though
[08:05:47] <gseguin> yeah I ran into the same issue
[08:05:55] <arschmitz> we cant do everything for every one
[08:06:30] <arschmitz> and only 3 added styles
[08:06:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: true
[08:06:57] <gseguin> arschmitz: true that
[08:07:14] <uGoMobi> another demo for the new docs :)
[08:07:17] <arschmitz> i mean if you can use jquery at all thats about as simple as it gets
[08:07:45] <arschmitz> ++ for good demo though
[08:07:57] <arschmitz> i can see the OP's use case for sure
[08:08:53] <arschmitz> and a very simple copy and past too
[08:10:01] <uGoMobi> would be nice if we can make the collapsible expand if the filter matches one of its LI's
[08:10:24] <arschmitz> give me a sec i think that shouldnt be too hard
[08:15:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that might not actually be great with a long list now that i think of it. because it filters on every key up so with a long list you enter a and all of a sudden the whole list expands!
[08:16:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah that's true
[08:16:49] <uGoMobi> so there should be a treshold as well... bit more difficult
[08:16:57] <arschmitz> for now i say add that jsbin to the issue and close.
[08:17:40] <arschmitz> if we do a demo for it we can considder more complicated stuff like that but i think it would start to get a bit over complicated for a simple demo then
[08:18:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: +1
[08:21:18] <gseguin> I'll paste the 2 bins
[08:21:37] <gseguin> oh wait
[08:21:51] <gseguin> yeah no, just arschmitz then
[08:22:16] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah uGoMobi's would be good if it didnt have 3 filters!
[08:23:11] <gseguin> right, and if it were filtering the LI as well
[08:23:18] <arschmitz> yeah that too
[08:23:31] <gseguin> thanks guys
[08:26:20] <arschmitz> gseguin: not a problem
[08:26:55] <arschmitz> when you posted that one my first thought was that theres got to be a way to do that easy already!
[08:27:15] <uGoMobi> yeah it takes some more effort to make that work with the collapsible widget, but was worth a try :)
[08:27:55] <arschmitz> yeah would have bee nice but the filtering just dosent reurse like that
[08:28:03] <arschmitz> recurse
[09:03:14] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[09:03:24] <frequent> thx for the JSbin.
[09:09:51] <gseguin> paging johnbender
[09:10:21] <agcolom> Good evening!
[09:11:39] <gseguin> hey agcolom
[09:11:50] <frequent> hey there
[09:22:40] <johnbender> gseguin: yo
[09:22:53] <johnbender> sorry
[09:22:58] <gseguin> hey, no worries
[09:23:09] <johnbender> barely coming up for air with this nav thing
[09:23:52] <gseguin> johnbender: wanted to talk about this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5188
[09:24:03] <gseguin> how familiar are you with Travis?
[09:24:06] <johnbender> fairly
[09:24:11] <johnbender> gseguin: I just don't see the point
[09:24:22] <johnbender> we're always going to need a custom ci server
[09:24:28] <johnbender> we'd be doing it for the badge
[09:24:40] <johnbender> and frankly our test suite isn't stable enough to be excited broadcasting that
[09:24:43] <johnbender> it has been at times
[09:24:47] <johnbender> but it's not right now
[09:25:36] <johnbender> speaking of which
[09:25:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: some of the sequence tests seem to be failing about every 10 or 12 times
[09:26:17] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm certainly not opposed to it, but keeping two CI servers up in the air with our test suite doesn't sound like fun to me
[09:26:20] <johnbender> :(
[09:26:40] * johnbender fully realizes he's to blame for a large portion of our test suite fragility
[09:27:01] * johnbender fully realizes he's probably to blame for all of our test suite fragility
[09:27:15] <gseguin> fair enough
[09:27:48] <gseguin> the badge is a cool thing though it can warn people using master on the condition of our codebase
[09:48:19] <johnbender> gseguin: this silly thing is that it would be trivial to produce something similar for jenkins
[09:48:24] <johnbender> "trivial"
[09:48:27] <johnbender> as long as you feel like doing it
[09:48:34] <johnbender> which is the problem :P
[10:08:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 6 new commits to master: http://git.io/11uCLg
[10:08:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Changed urlParseRE to ignore space at beginning. This is expected - Jeffrey Lembeck
[10:08:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge branch 'master' of github.com:jquery/jquery-mobile into issue-4882 - Jeffrey Lembeck
[10:08:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Changing test to make sure it fails when code change is not there - Jeffrey Lembeck
[10:38:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you still here?
[10:38:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[10:38:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: do you have an iphone or ipod?
[10:39:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nope
[10:39:09] <agcolom> Hi arschmitz! Are you after someone to test something?
[10:39:29] <gseguin> arschmitz: do you have access to Browserstack?
[10:39:48] <arschmitz> lol no and yes
[10:40:02] <gseguin> I have an iPod touch
[10:40:15] <agcolom> arschmitz: I can test stuff for you if you like. I have an iPhone/iPodTouch/iPad (all different ios versions)
[10:40:20] <arschmitz> also have a ton of ios devices i was just looking for someone to look at a demo using ui sortable
[10:40:52] <arschmitz> not fully done yet but its pretty neat on iphone ipod
[10:41:07] <agcolom> do you have a URL?
[10:41:29] <arschmitz> just a sec ill get a short link for it its miles long ha ha
[10:41:42] <agcolom> arschmitz: thx ;-)
[10:42:09] <agcolom> arschmitz: should I try on the iPhone or iPad?
[10:42:27] <arschmitz> iphone i havnt written the media queries for ipad yet
[10:42:32] <agcolom> ok
[10:43:35] <arschmitz> https://bitly.com/SBG554
[10:43:44] <arschmitz> just pretend its actually your ios home screen
[10:44:13] <arschmitz> (hold down to re-arange, swipe to next screen etc)
[10:44:21] <agcolom> sure
[10:46:12] <arschmitz> it actually works fine on desktop too just not as neat
[10:46:50] <agcolom> cool!
[10:47:03] <arschmitz> thought it would be a good advanced demo
[10:47:25] <agcolom> yes definitely! (sorry got a quick phone call!) ok now...
[10:47:50] <frequent> arschmitz: very nice! especially kicking the icons out of view :-)
[10:48:03] <frequent> and works on iOS3
[10:48:19] <arschmitz> cool i dont have anything with ios3 so hadent tried
[10:48:39] <arschmitz> but emulates the native functionality pretty well
[10:49:16] <arschmitz> i think my favorite part is how they "shake" just like real
[10:49:17] <frequent> I overwrote the listview CSS to get something similar, but without the functionality.
[10:49:56] <arschmitz> cool yeah this is a ui sortable with touch punch
[10:50:07] <frequent> wait...
[10:51:13] <arschmitz> ??
[10:51:50] <frequent> bitly this: http://bit.ly/UN8YQj
[10:52:01] <frequent> sitting on it right now.
[10:52:23] <arschmitz> cool
[10:52:35] <arschmitz> similar like you said just without the functionality
[10:53:09] <frequent> yup. I need to see look under your hood...
[10:53:24] * mspisars coughs
[10:53:30] <frequent> ;-)
[10:53:32] <mspisars> frequent where do you want to look?
[10:53:42] <mspisars> :)
[10:53:44] <agcolom> arschmitz: sometimes I cannot rearrange the icons on the 1st screen (iPodTouch iOS 5.0.1) I'm not sure yet of the sequence of action to reproduce. What is the event to start (is it hold down or hold down and move?)
[10:53:49] <frequent> there: https://bitly.com/SBG554
[10:56:17] <mspisars> just hold down til the whole screen wiggles
[10:56:22] <mspisars> agcolom
[10:57:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4389#issuecomment-9820882 cool! Q: is there another closed or open issue for that?
[10:57:09] <frequent> arschmitz: after a while it seems to hang up = I cannot get the icons to wiggle anymore.
[10:58:27] <agcolom> yes, is there something missing for the jQuery icon on the 1st screen? I cannot seem to get the effect started when holding down on that one.
[10:58:55] <frequent> but I'm also chasing this "randowm dead button" effect elsewhere, so might be iOS3 related, too.
[10:58:58] <agcolom> although that works fine on the desktop
[10:59:13] <mspisars> it looks like the issue is you cannot fire the event after it has been fired on that icon
[10:59:19] <mspisars> so for me jquery worked first time
[10:59:24] <mspisars> then did not work until refresh
[10:59:40] <agcolom> mspisars: yes, I think this is it
[10:59:47] <mspisars> and this is the same for every icon that I did this to.
[10:59:48] <frequent> same here
[10:59:50] <arschmitz> have to check it out
[11:00:11] <mspisars> after the done button is pressed is the even handler still there?
[11:00:36] <arschmitz> i just changed the logic a bit so probably forgot to chage a one back to on
[11:00:56] <arschmitz> ill go back and check it out
[11:11:57] <arschmitz> thank you every one as i expected forgot to change a one to on all should be good now
[11:14:46] <agcolom> arschmitz: ok, trying now... same URL?
[11:18:40] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes all seems to work fine now :)
[11:18:50] <agcolom> very nice example!
[11:21:47] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:22:02] <toddmparker> catching up
[11:22:37] <toddmparker> I was closing issues as I walked into work
[11:24:11] <agcolom> hey toddmparker !
[11:24:25] <agcolom> sorry my connection was so awful yesterday!
[11:24:33] <arschmitz> hey todd
[11:25:15] <frequent> hi there
[11:25:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker: look at pretend its your ioshomescreen swipe to next page hold to re arange etc https://bitly.com/SBG554
[11:26:21] <arschmitz> on your iphone
[11:34:32] <toddmparker> cools sortign examples
[11:36:51] <toddmparker> neat arschmitz
[11:38:32] <arschmitz> works on desktop too but not as cool
[11:39:12] <arschmitz> wanted a grid sorting demo
[11:50:55] <agcolom> arschmitz: so you were at the summit? shame we didn't meet!
[11:55:10] <arschmitz> agcolom: I bowled with you
[11:55:23] <agcolom> arschmitz: did you?
[11:55:25] <agcolom> cool!
[11:55:29] <agcolom> So who are you?
[11:56:27] <arschmitz> yea i was a heavy set guy greenn plaid shirt sat next to wilto at summit

[11:58:31] <arschmitz> ha ha yea
[12:06:06] <gnarf> agcolom: you sound about as good with names as me :)
[12:07:24] <agcolom> gnarf: hey! I'm normally quite good ;-) but we didn't get to talk and get introduced to everyone :-) maybe we should have a cross table introduction next time ;-)
[12:08:08] <gnarf> agcolom: i met people at like 9 tables :)
[12:08:19] <gnarf> agcolom: i was like a table butterfly
[12:08:27] <arschmitz> gnarf: we met ha ha
[12:08:33] <agcolom> (maybe I was too busy pulling in PRs ;-) )
[12:08:59] <Wilto> I’m still not 100% sure who any you people are.
[12:09:04] <Wilto> any of you*
[12:09:07] * gnarf jabs Wilto
[12:09:18] <Wilto> how did I even get here

[12:44:10] <arschmitz> Damn my car just broke down lol!
[12:48:44] <frequent> what car can you pick IRC as add-on?
[12:49:18] <arschmitz> ha ha
[12:49:45] <arschmitz> not mine thats for sure
[12:50:39] <frequent> ;-)
[13:23:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 2 new commits to tables: http://git.io/8Bi5_A
[13:23:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/tables] first change is to let colspans increment by the number of cols they span - Scott Jehl
[13:23:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/tables] colspans toggle dependent cols - Scott Jehl
[13:26:54] <ryanneufeld> agcolom: we're friends now, so says facebook!
[13:27:25] <agcolom> ryanneufeld: indeed ;-)
[13:32:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Re: sequence tests: I noticed that, and it behaves as if I don't call start() out of one of the tests, even though I do. I suspect it may have something to do with external/qunit.js:377, where it sets a timeout of 13. That timeout seems to get readded in an infinite non-busy loop.
[13:33:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: IIRC it was doing that reliably with the path1-path1-no-push-state page which I have since removed.
[13:37:40] <mspisars> is there a simple way to turn rounded corners on a per element basis or globally?
[13:39:47] <_|Nix|_> mspisars: $.mobile.buttonMarkup.default.corners = true|false ... try that.
[13:40:02] <_|Nix|_> s/default/defaults/
[13:40:10] <mspisars> ty
[13:40:20] <_|Nix|_> mspisars: Do that in a mobileinit handler.
[13:41:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you get a chance to look at it that would be great
[13:42:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to tables: http://git.io/0wc56A
[13:42:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/tables] Removing the right text alignment for now, confusing visually - toddparker
[13:43:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, but it's quite a doozie. I mean, it's not like I can reproduce it reliably, and I suspect it may be a bug in qunit ...
[13:43:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nevertheless, I'll try to poke around.
[13:43:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: For example, I'll run the tests in a loop locally to see if that ever happens.
[13:51:25] <mspisars> _|Nix|_: $.mobile.buttonMarkup.defaults.corners did not work...
[13:55:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if there's a single offender and we can't get it working we might want to take it out to avoid false alarms
[13:56:53] <agcolom> toddmparker_, toddmparker__ Hi! I need your advice for something if you're around....
[13:58:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[13:58:37] <gseguin> agcolom: you forgot toddmparker
[13:58:40] <_|Nix|_> mspisars: Sorry, it's $.fn.buttonMarkup.defaults.corners ...
[13:59:22] <_|Nix|_> mspisars: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/393/edit
[13:59:24] <agcolom> is it toddmparker today?
[13:59:43] <mspisars> ty _|Nix|_ that works.
[13:59:50] <arschmitz> he is the man of man names
[14:00:12] <agcolom> gseguin: hard to keep up with all these identities ;-)
[14:00:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll check all the intermittent failures to see if it was the same test.
[14:06:30] <toddmparker> hey agcolom
[14:06:40] <toddmparker> somebody should give me an IRC lesson
[14:08:15] <agcolom> hey toddmparker !
[14:08:50] <agcolom> On the api.jqueryui.com site, they have 2 books (bottom right hand-side of the page)
[14:09:22] <agcolom> is there a book/books we should have there for our api docs?
[14:10:10] <gseguin> toddmparker: you can connect all your clients to the znc server, you'll end up using only one nick
[14:12:35] <frequent> toddparker: http://bit.ly/h8kbIq
[14:14:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, the frequency of spontaneous failures is not high. Between builds 652 and 795 it happened twice.
[14:14:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Mind you, it did fail on the sequence tests many more times than that, but in those cases, it didn't simply peter out - that is, one test after another completes successfully, but then it just hangs and times out.
[14:15:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: In those cases, it recorded failures /and/ timed out. However, in those cases, other suites also recorded failures.
[14:17:55] <arschmitz> looking for some input on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4860 im leaning towards wont fix and put a note in the docs.
[14:18:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: For example: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/768/console
[14:21:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Egads!
[14:21:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I vote WONTFIX.
[14:21:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sane people use lowercase.
[14:21:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ that was my thought
[14:22:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I write WONTFIX in all caps because that's a bugzilla tradition.
[14:22:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Same with WORKSFORME.
[14:22:17] <arschmitz> checked and the native browser dosent care about case but still too complicated for such an edge case and easy note in the docs
[14:22:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Might also want to pass it on to core.
[14:22:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: After all, it's perfectly valid HTML ...
[14:23:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ its not that the input dosent work
[14:23:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and core could fix this properly.
[14:23:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know. Our selector is being run case-sensitively.
[14:23:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ we just dont enhance it because we have a selector to look for searchs input.is( "[type='search'],:jqmData(type='search')" )
[14:23:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm saying that by passing it to core, we can find out why they run selectors case-sensitively.
[14:24:00] <toddmparker> agcolom: Not sure about books
[14:24:03] <arschmitz> oh i see
[14:24:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know.
[14:24:10] <toddmparker> there is supposed to be a book site feed eventually
[14:24:16] <toddmparker> maybe scott would know?
[14:24:27] <arschmitz> yeah thing is classes and id's are case sensitive
[14:24:40] <agcolom> toddmparker: sure, no pb. I've asked Scott G to find out how they chose the ones they have there...
[14:24:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Core could fix it so standard attributes are matched case-insensitively.
[14:24:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or all attributes, for that matter.
[14:25:22] <arschmitz> yeah that makes sense anything execpt class or id could be insensitive.
[14:25:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: CSS is case-sensitive?
[14:25:49] <arschmitz> pretty sure?
[14:25:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: i.e., .myClass !== .myClAss?
[14:26:04] <arschmitz> now i have to verify that ha ha
[14:26:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You beat me to it.
[14:26:30] <toddmparker> arschmitz: msft uses a lot of all cap attars and values
[14:26:35] <toddmparker> so that sucks
[14:26:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The case sensitivity might be there for performance reasons.
[14:26:42] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ^
[14:27:28] <_|Nix|_> Doing a case-insensitive match requires that one first convert both sides to lowercase ...
[14:27:55] <arschmitz> ok css IS case sensitive
[14:28:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[14:28:15] <agcolom> toddmparker: I need to create an index page, similar to the one that exists for UI: http://api.jqueryui.com/
[14:28:23] <Wilto> WHO SAID CSS
[14:28:36] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Nobody. We said css, not CSS.
[14:28:42] <agcolom> Do you have any preference/idea/recommendations regarding what should be mentioned there?
[14:28:58] <Wilto> —waaaait.
[14:29:41] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: OK, I admit, I said CSS a few lines back.
[14:30:31] <Wilto> This ain’t CSS’ fault.
[14:30:48] <Wilto> [type="…"] isn’t case sensitive in any browser I know of.
[14:30:49] <arschmitz> no css works sanely and case sensitive
[14:30:51] <Wilto> Here…
[14:31:20] <Wilto> http://jsfiddle.net/pFHRn/
[14:31:31] <Wilto> Betting this is us checking something in the JavaScript prior to a class getting applied.
[14:31:43] <arschmitz> it is you missed that up a ways
[14:31:44] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Selectors in CSS are processed case-insensitively, which is good, but selectors processed using Sizzle are processed case-sensitively.
[14:31:56] <Wilto> Oh, right.
[14:32:16] <arschmitz>  input.is( "[type='search'],:jqmData(type='search')" ) is the issue Wilto:
[14:32:24] <Wilto> Yeah, I was gonna say—it’s either us haphazardly checking something, or Sizzle.
[14:32:25] <arschmitz> wont match SEARCH
[14:32:29] <Wilto> Right, right.
[14:32:45] <_|Nix|_> I think we might wanna pass that over to core.
[14:32:53] <_|Nix|_> In fact, I might just swing by and ask.
[14:32:55] <Wilto> Eh, I dunno.
[14:32:57] <Wilto> Worth asking.
[14:33:06] <Wilto> I know they just locked it down; I’m not sure how it works with qSA.
[14:33:30] <arschmitz> yeah id say this sounds like core not us
[14:33:51] <Wilto> Sizzle is pretty strict about escaped characters and whatnot after the last rewrite; case sensitivity would be no surprise.
[14:33:56] <Wilto> Paging timmywil.
[14:34:15] <arschmitz> other wise we would have to do something crazy like a MASSIVE selector or loop through every input and compare the attributes after converting to lower
[14:35:16] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I asked in #jquery-dev ...

[15:50:28] <gseguin> have a good weekend
[18:32:54] <mspisars> it looks like custom select menu's do not clear out the associated ".ui-popup-container ui-selectmenu-hidden" once removed from the DOM.
[18:32:54] <mspisars> once the select is removed from the dom.
[18:32:54] <mspisars> So having dynamically generated pages ends up creating a TON of hiddne popup containers.
[18:43:38] <mspisars> looks like it's already logged: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4661
