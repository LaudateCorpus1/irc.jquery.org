[11:23:32] <gseguin> Wilto: didn't you fix the on pixel thing with fixed headers on Android?
[11:23:46] <gseguin> s/on/one/
[11:23:52] <Wilto> Thought that was sorted, yeah.
[11:24:06] <Wilto> It was a matter of removing top borders from fixed headers.
[11:24:19] <Wilto> _Because Android knows only nonsense_.
[11:24:24] <Wilto> Not that I’m bitter.
[11:24:33] <gseguin> I just dropped latest into our app
[11:24:44] <gseguin> and the problem is here
[11:24:52] <gseguin> let me see with jquerymobile.com/test
[11:26:02] <Wilto> Woah.
[11:26:09] <Wilto> Test looks kinda screwed up in general.
[11:26:25] <gseguin> yep still happening with /test
[11:26:30] <gseguin> how so?
[11:26:41] <Wilto> The buttons in the fixed header are busted.
[11:26:53] <Wilto> But they’re looking okay locally.
[11:27:01] <gseguin> working here on my phone
[11:27:33] <Wilto> Weird…
[11:32:19] <toddparker> Wilto: buttons don't work here for you? http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html
[11:32:29] <toddparker> desktop or phone?
[11:33:13] <toddparker> johnbender: so what should we do here re: your comment? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3836#issuecomment-4826761

[13:56:16] <Wilto> what
[13:57:06] <Wilto> I don’t think I like your tone, jenkins.
[13:58:37] <Wilto> Passing locally.

[14:37:13] <Wilto> I dunno who that chump was, but he sure sucks at this.
[14:37:30] <Wilto> (I am that chump.)
[14:39:10] <LakWork> lol
[14:41:03] <toddparker> heading out in a few…have a great weekend everyone
[14:41:04] <gseguin> Wilto, toddparker: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEht7VqwDO8 this is the flashing I was talking about yesterday
[14:41:15] <toddparker> shooting for wednesday. pencils down.
[14:42:36] <toddparker> hmm. i've seen that a bit myself
[14:42:41] <toddparker> bit that's worse
[14:42:55] <gseguin> you'll also notice that when I scroll back up the header moves like one pixel down and comes back up pretty much every time I swipe
[14:43:09] <toddparker> that is an ios5 bug
[14:43:13] <toddparker> there is a jitter
[14:45:14] <toddparker> can you compare against a 4S to see if there is a difference
[14:45:17] <gseguin> toddparker: did we file that bug with apple?
[14:45:28] <toddparker> wondering if that is bogged down and it's just failing to keep up
[14:45:37] <toddparker> we didn't
[14:45:45] <toddparker> problem is you can't see if one is filed
[14:45:51] <toddparker> guess we could file anyway
[14:46:03] <toddparker> ICS has no jitter. one benefit
[14:46:15] <toddparker> apple's closed tracker is bad
[14:46:20] <gseguin> I'll wait for the 4S to come back and I'll make a video
[15:15:14] <gseguin> toddparker: on 4S it looks pretty good: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFl8LZrGCY
[15:15:41] <gseguin> though what's up with the header disappearing on reload? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-8LUQRQXNo
