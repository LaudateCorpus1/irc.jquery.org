[07:07:27] <scottjehl> morning
[07:07:41] <scottjehl> first on our agenda here this morning is to test that dom cache branch
[07:13:43] <dnsdds> Does/can/will jQuery Mobile support iPad style popovers?
[07:14:14] <aaronmcadam> i think that might be a custom build of jqm dnsdds
[07:15:38] <toddparker> at the moment, no
[07:16:22] <toddparker> unless you use the select menu which opens as popover on ipad, spinner on ios, menu on webos, etc. - whatever native control
[07:16:25] <dnsdds> toddparker: In the roadmap? Around the corner or in the foggy horizon?
[07:16:49] <toddparker> post-1.0, we will be adding an overlay widget
[07:16:59] <dnsdds> ETA?
[07:17:04] <toddparker> that can be used as a menu, popover, mini-dialog
[07:17:10] <toddparker> fall
[07:17:16] <dnsdds> Cool
[07:17:19] <dnsdds> Thank you
[07:17:21] <toddparker> np
[07:17:25] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[07:17:30] <aaronmcadam> makes sense
[07:17:32] <aaronmcadam> cool todd :)
[07:17:53] <aaronmcadam> just another plugin that needs to be decoupled to call programmatically?
[07:18:21] <toddparker> aaronmcadam - are you referring to the popover?
[07:18:30] <aaronmcadam> yep
[07:18:42] <toddparker> yeah, it will just be another decoupled plugin
[07:18:47] <aaronmcadam> awesome :D
[07:18:49] <toddparker> so people can build whatever they need
[07:19:01] <aaronmcadam> did u get my details the other day? i had to jet off from work quickly
[07:19:02] <toddparker> we're already at the point where not everyone needs the same widgets
[07:19:24] <aaronmcadam> yeah I'm not using grids at the moment
[07:19:36] <aaronmcadam> but actually, I probably will need to
[07:19:50] <aaronmcadam> still workin on functionality, haven't started theming yet
[07:20:59] <aaronmcadam> do you think it'd make sense to use jsfiddle for demoing the api?
[07:21:06] <aaronmcadam> to let people experiment?
[07:26:01] <toddparker> i really like jsfiddle. actually prefer jsbin because it simpler
[07:26:12] <aaronmcadam> true
[07:26:19] <aaronmcadam> but can u include resources with jsbin?
[07:26:38] <aaronmcadam> spose u could put script tags in the html
[07:26:40] <toddparker> they'd need to be linked to - cdn, etc.
[07:26:57] <aaronmcadam> yeah I'm using .latest on code.jquery
[07:33:21] <gseguin_> morning
[07:33:44] <gseguin_> toddparker: I found out what the flashing is about with the transitions
[07:37:55] <gseguin_> also you may have heard @rem released a great debugging tool a la weinre: http://jsconsole.com/remote-debugging.html
[07:57:48] <aaronmcadam> thanks gseguin_ :)
[09:48:09] <scottjehl> heyo
[09:48:18] <gseguin> hiya
[09:49:02] <gseguin> hey scottjehl: I moved the transitions back to non-push
[09:49:12] <gseguin> there was still a flashing going on
[09:49:16] <scottjehl> non-push
[09:49:18] <scottjehl> ?
[09:49:27] <scottjehl> ohh ok
[09:49:29] <gseguin> overlap
[09:49:30] <scottjehl> gotcha
[09:49:44] <scottjehl> hey _nickel
[09:49:48] <gseguin> there was still a flashing happening
[09:49:53] <scottjehl> hmm ok
[09:50:04] <scottjehl> translateZ(0) might help
[09:50:09] <scottjehl> only during transitions tho
[09:50:18] <scottjehl> otherwise it'll bring crashes
[09:50:24] <_nickel> scottjehl: yo!
[09:50:30] <scottjehl> or... -webkit-backface-visiblity: hidden;
[09:50:33] <scottjehl> try those
[09:50:38] <scottjehl> (if you hadn't already)
[09:50:45] <_nickel> scottjehl: hows the "charles proxy" testing going
[09:50:54] <_nickel> I still don't know what that is/means
[09:50:55] <scottjehl> http://filamentgroup.com/video/godparker.MOV
[09:50:56] <gseguin> scottjehl: done that
[09:51:06] <scottjehl> that's the Todd proxy
[09:51:07] <gseguin> the problem is in the transition function
[09:51:25] <gseguin> it expects it to be a 2 moving parts transition
[09:51:51] <gseguin> so it works when transitioning from A to B
[09:52:02] <gseguin> but the reverse transition is buggy
[09:53:19] <gseguin> because it's starting a transition that basically does nothing but takes 325 ms
[09:53:59] <gseguin> and waits until that do-nothing transition is done to remove the transitionning classes
[09:54:08] <gseguin> that causes a flash
[09:54:24] <gseguin> do I make sense?
[09:54:49] <scottjehl> yep makes sense
[09:55:43] <gseguin> problem is flip is really a 2 moving parts transition
[09:56:15] <gseguin> where both in and out are moving
[09:56:39] <gseguin> so that css3Transition function needs fixed
[09:57:36] <scottjehl> k. yeah I guess it makes sense we'll need to adapt it for this
[09:58:43] <gseguin> alright so that's the way I started going
[09:59:13] <gseguin> Today is Jive day though, I hope I'll have some time this weekend to play with this
[09:59:42] <gseguin> I can push what I have even though there are still problems, if you think you'll have time to look at ti
[09:59:53] <scottjehl> ok awesome. yeah go ahead and push that
[10:05:28] <toddparker> hey _nickel
[10:05:38] <_nickel> toddparker: yo!
[10:05:48] <_nickel> toddparker: hows the dom cache testing going?
[10:05:48] <toddparker> just tested your som branch on all our devices and didn't spot any regressions
[10:05:57] <_nickel> lol "my" dom branch
[10:05:58] <toddparker> so i think it's good to go
[10:06:06] <toddparker> well, you know
[10:06:13] <aaronmcadam> hey guys, sorry to bang on about docs again
[10:06:16] <toddparker> you want to hit the button?
[10:06:30] <aaronmcadam> but just had 3 or 4 people today asking in #jquerymobile about missing the meta tag
[10:06:31] <toddparker> what's up
[10:06:48] <toddparker> that's in the docs now
[10:06:58] <toddparker> but it won't get pushed until next week
[10:07:01] <toddparker> with beta 2
[10:07:05] <aaronmcadam> ahh cool!!
[10:07:09] <aaronmcadam> nice :D
[10:07:35] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/docs-pages.html
[10:07:40] <toddparker> it's in the boilerplates too
[10:07:57] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-template.html
[10:08:03] <toddparker> we just missed it for beta 1
[10:08:16] <toddparker> it was mentioned in the release notes a few times, but you know
[10:08:35] <toddparker> so _nickel - you going to push to master?
[10:08:45] <_nickel> ah yes
[10:08:50] <_nickel> I can do a rebase / merge
[10:09:10] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah toddparker it's typical non-RTFM :)
[10:10:46] <_nickel> toddparker: whoa
[10:10:50] <_nickel> totally clean rebase
[10:10:54] * _nickel enjoyes his luck
[10:10:56] <toddparker> amazing
[10:11:06] <toddparker> it'll never happen again
[10:11:30] <toddparker> scott's been rebasing daily
[10:11:47] <scottjehl> woops back
[10:11:57] <aaronmcadam> :D
[10:12:07] <aaronmcadam> is that cuz so much is changing guys?
[10:12:16] <aaronmcadam> never really used rebase
[10:13:09] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: running the whole test suite
[10:13:28] <scottjehl> cool
[10:13:38] <scottjehl> I've noticed init sometimes fails when running the test runner
[10:13:45] <scottjehl> but fine when opening directly
[10:13:53] <scottjehl> not a big deal
[10:16:17] <_nickel> toddparker: we need testswarm ]
[10:16:21] <_nickel> -]
[10:16:41] <_nickel> scottjehl: there are some fragile tests in the suite thats for sure
[10:16:53] <_nickel> scottjehl: anything that exposes them is good
[10:18:29] <scottjehl> sure
[10:18:32] <scottjehl> so how we lookin
[10:19:02] <_nickel> with the dom cache branch?
[10:19:32] <_nickel> just merged locally, running the tests again for my own sanity and then I'll push to master
[10:19:41] <scottjehl> yeah. ready to drop? cool
[10:19:52] <_nickel> yassir
[10:19:58] <toddparker> bender, do you have an android 2.1 devices?
[10:20:26] <toddparker> cool
[10:20:31] <_nickel> toddparker: I have a 1.6 device but no 2.1 :(
[10:20:55] <toddparker> oh, bummer
[10:21:06] <toddparker> i had an issue i though you might be able to help debug
[10:21:26] <toddparker> tho if you have the emulator, it's probably reproducible there
[10:21:27] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2174
[10:21:45] <toddparker> hash with params for dialog and nested lists are broken
[10:22:03] <_nickel> hmm
[10:22:47] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl pushed
[10:22:57] <toddparker> gseguin - do you have a 2.1 android phone?
[10:23:03] <toddparker> _nickel - woo hoo!!
[10:23:05] <scottjehl> _nickel http://scottjehl.com/i/yaaaaaaaa.gif
[10:23:08] <toddparker> awesome
[10:23:35] <toddparker> testing is fun: http://filamentgroup.com/video/godparker.MOV
[10:24:00] <scottjehl> http://scottjehl.com/i/goodnews.gif
[10:24:25] <scottjehl> this is a big one. :)
[10:24:36] <scottjehl> nice work, team
[10:27:11] <_nickel> bizarre that it took me so long to update my gravatar
[10:31:17] <scottjehl> cool, so we can delete that branch out then eh
[10:31:28] <scottjehl> or did you/
[10:31:52] <scottjehl> we've got some old branches to delete too, on that topic
[10:31:56] <scottjehl> fastclick-fixes
[10:32:07] <scottjehl> path-fixes
[10:32:17] <scottjehl> navigation
[10:32:34] <scottjehl> I think Kin's still working with pagecontainer
[10:34:25] <gseguin> toddparker: looking through our treasure chest
[10:34:51] <gseguin> toddparker: we do
[10:35:02] <gseguin> what should I do with it?
[10:35:49] <_nickel> scottjehl: I can get rid of it
[10:37:31] <_nickel> scottjehl: deleted
[10:50:54] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: I'm going to eat something since my body is slowly consuming my stomach and other organs for protien and then I'm going to get back to the select
[10:51:08] <_nickel> *protein
[10:51:54] <toddparker> yummy thought
[10:52:27] <gseguin> toddparker: why did you need an android 2.1 for?
[10:52:35] <gseguin> I've got one handy
[11:05:50] <toddparker> we have a nasty issue on 2.1 with dialogs and nested lists:
[11:05:51] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2174
[11:05:59] <toddparker> do you have time to take a look?
[11:06:08] <toddparker> i'd like to fix for beta 2 is we can
[11:06:30] <gseguin> no time today
[11:06:35] <gseguin> but maybe this weekend
[11:06:54] <eddiemonge> toddparker: can you tag me on that?
[11:07:53] <gseguin> eddiemonge: you want to look at issue 2174 ?
[11:08:13] <eddiemonge> oh wait, let me check that my hero is actually 2.1 and not 2.2
[11:08:29] <eddiemonge> but i guess that shouldnt matter since i can use the 2.1 emulator
[11:08:36] <eddiemonge> ill take a look to see if i can work it out
[11:12:44] <gseguin> I created an eddiemonge tag and labelled that issue with it
[11:13:47] <gseguin> keep me posted with your findings
[11:16:51] <eddiemonge> ill see if i can get to it today but if not tomorrow. today is going to be super busy for me today as im finishing up an app, coding a wordpress template for a client, creating a dynamic index for the jQuery CDN and oh by the way coding up the new jQuery template in wordpress. i may be doing a 24 hour code sprint
[11:18:26] <eddiemonge> toddparker: quicktime? really? not html5 video at least?
[11:19:18] <scottjehl> emailed straight from my iphone
[11:19:20] <scottjehl> :)
[11:20:10] <eddiemonge> hmm theres an app. shoot video, upload video and html all formatted
[12:02:26] <scottjehl> _nickel
[12:02:27] <scottjehl> ping
[12:02:32] <_nickel> scottjehl: yo
[12:02:51] <scottjehl> so, I was just testing domCache and I think we have one part off
[12:03:09] <scottjehl> in nav js
[12:03:16] <scottjehl> where we check !page.jqmData("domCache")
[12:03:25] <scottjehl> that's only checking that elem's data attr
[12:03:35] <scottjehl> but not the page plugin option
[12:03:41] <_nickel> true facts
[12:03:47] <scottjehl> I think it needs to be
[12:03:48] <scottjehl> !page.data("page").options.domCache
[12:03:52] <_nickel> can't be
[12:04:10] <_nickel> domCache isn't defined until enhance I believe
[12:04:11] <scottjehl> it works if I move it after the enhancepage call...?
[12:04:15] <_nickel> yes
[12:04:19] <_nickel> but then the listview won't work
[12:04:35] <_nickel> because of the event binding order
[12:04:53] <scottjehl> hmm
[12:05:05] <scottjehl> another option is to manually set the data in page plugin
[12:05:08] <_nickel> this is one case where the options should really exist out side of a page instance
[12:05:09] <scottjehl> based on option val
[12:05:21] <scottjehl> hmm no nevermind
[12:06:04] <scottjehl> problem is there's no current way to set this default to true
[12:06:13] <scottjehl> you have to attr every page
[12:06:18] <_nickel> right
[12:06:49] <scottjehl> is that the limitation we want to ship with now?
[12:06:55] <_nickel> can we define the defaults on the widget itself?
[12:06:55] <scottjehl> better than nothing?
[12:07:15] <scottjehl> yeah like, I was creating a new test that loaded the lib and then did the following:
[12:07:15] <_nickel> the prototype I guess
[12:07:40] <scottjehl> $.mobile.page.prototype.options.domCache = true
[12:07:52] <scottjehl> like most any plugin can do
[12:07:57] <scottjehl> hmm
[12:08:14] <_nickel> one sec
[12:08:16] <_nickel> brb
[12:21:10] <scottjehl> I think we'll have to push the blog post as "we're working on tweaking it so that the default can be overridden globally via ..."
[12:23:02] <_nickel> scottjehl: when are we looking to post?
[12:23:10] <scottjehl> today
[12:23:19] <_nickel> scottjehl: hmm let me take a look
[12:24:47] <_nickel> scottjehl: yah I see the issue here
[12:24:54] <scottjehl> oh?
[12:24:55] <_nickel> since we have to have central place to reconcile the global with the local
[12:25:07] <_nickel> just pointing out what you were seeing
[12:25:11] <scottjehl> oh
[12:25:11] <scottjehl> yeah
[12:25:20] <_nickel> which is generally done through the options extension
[12:25:52] <scottjehl> well it's more that we're not checking the option of that widget at all
[12:25:58] <scottjehl> that's only 1 of 3 ways to set it
[12:26:05] <scottjehl> data- I mean
[12:26:20] <scottjehl> you could do elem.page({domCache: true});
[12:26:26] <scottjehl> that also won't work now
[12:27:43] <scottjehl> I think it'd be best to call enhancePage then check
[12:27:50] <scottjehl> and somehow fix listview for that
[12:28:06] <_nickel> do we have an enchanced event?
[12:28:10] <_nickel> page enhanced?
[12:28:23] <scottjehl> pagecreate?
[12:28:33] <_nickel> are those equivelant
[12:28:43] <scottjehl> not sure what you mean
[12:28:55] <scottjehl> enhancePage is just a private function in navigation
[12:29:04] <scottjehl> calls the page() plugin, among a few other things
[12:29:20] <scottjehl> but pagecreate is the event that the page plugin dispatches
[12:29:23] <_nickel> scottjehl: and it could fire an "enhanced" on the page itself
[12:29:26] <scottjehl> also pagebeforecreate
[12:29:39] <_nickel> scottjehl: hmm I'm unsure of the timing
[12:29:44] <_nickel> but I'll gist you what I mean
[12:29:45] <_nickel> one sec
[12:29:50] <scottjehl> I can take a look too
[12:31:16] <_nickel> scottjehl: https://gist.github.com/0021e29eea9490b801f1
[12:31:23] <_nickel> from the listveiw
[12:32:07] <scottjehl> I like where you're headed here
[12:32:10] <scottjehl> does it work?
[12:32:11] <_nickel> there are some scoping issues there but thats the idea
[12:32:13] <_nickel> lol
[12:32:15] <_nickel> no I didn't try it
[12:32:24] <scottjehl> commit / push / weekend!
[12:32:26] <_nickel> lol
[12:32:33] <_nickel> and we're staircasing off into the universe there
[12:33:12] <scottjehl> does this bind for each sublist?
[12:33:38] <scottjehl> have I mentioned how much I hate nested lists yet today?
[12:34:40] <_nickel> lol
[12:35:48] <scottjehl> can't wait to decouple that one
[12:38:06] <_nickel> i'm playing around with the alternate solution
[12:38:34] <scottjehl> cool
[12:38:45] <scottjehl> not sure what the staircase universe thing meant...
[12:39:01] <scottjehl> http://scottjehl.com/i/plzrepeat.jpeg
[12:41:28] <_nickel> the indentation level
[12:41:31] <_nickel> and scoping
[12:41:35] <_nickel> so
[12:41:46] <_nickel> I'm confused as to how/when pagecreate gets fired
[12:41:51] <_nickel> is that a widget factory thing?
[12:42:27] <scottjehl> yep
[12:42:45] <_nickel> so is there a post create event we could bind to?
[12:42:53] <scottjehl> that's pagecreate
[12:43:17] <scottjehl> so, widget factory dispatches a create event on all widgets as soon as the _create method finishes
[12:43:27] <_nickel> hmm
[12:43:31] <_nickel> that won't work in this case
[12:43:41] <_nickel> unless we do the same binding for the navigation page delet
[12:46:53] <scottjehl> unsure
[12:47:28] <_nickel> scottjehl: I think I've got it
[12:47:51] <scottjehl> rokk
[12:48:11] <_nickel> one sec
[12:51:44] <_nickel> scottjehl: it appears to be working
[12:51:48] <_nickel> scottjehl: need to run the tests
[12:51:53] <_nickel> then I'll push to let you take a gander
[12:51:59] <scottjehl> Friday hero
[12:55:49] <_nickel> scottjehl: pushed
[12:55:58] <_nickel> scottjehl: take a look
[12:56:11] <_nickel> probably should have pushed to branch for viewing
[12:56:12] <_nickel> ugh
[12:56:16] * _nickel is low on sleep
[12:56:22] <scottjehl> s'ok
[13:00:23] <scottjehl> it's workin
[13:00:49] <_nickel> scottjehl: :D
[13:01:24] <_nickel> brb
[13:01:28] <_nickel> getting a soda
[13:01:36] <scottjehl> adding a test
[13:03:53] <_nickel> scottjehl: was just about to do that myself
[13:03:56] <scottjehl> k test added
[13:03:58] <scottjehl> pushed
[13:04:08] <scottjehl> go team
[13:04:35] <_nickel> seriously
[13:07:39] <_nickel> toddparker: did we find anyone with a 2.1?
[13:07:46] <_nickel> I was going to suggest a bisect to save time
[13:08:08] <_nickel> scottjehl: pageSequence ftw eh?
[13:08:41] <scottjehl> go for it, if you want to try
[13:08:44] <scottjehl> yeah!
[13:09:13] <_nickel> scottjehl: I'm going to dive back into the select
[13:09:34] <scottjehl> great!
[13:09:36] <scottjehl> thanks
[13:09:42] <scottjehl> I think we're wrapped for b2
[13:10:01] <scottjehl> aside from that android 2.1 regression
[13:10:05] <scottjehl> not sure what that was
[13:12:45] <_nickel> yah thats narsty
[13:13:13] <scottjehl> nesteds and dialogs are so hard
[13:14:03] <scottjehl> especially with pushstate stuff
[13:16:12] <scottjehl> blog post is up
[13:16:13] <scottjehl> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/07/29/team-update-week-of-july-25th/
[13:16:27] <scottjehl> nice work once again, toddparker
[13:21:11] <eddiemonge> "see a live demo of the docs synced every minute" is false. its actually only synced when a commit is pushed to git.
[13:22:15] <scottjehl> ah good catch
[13:22:21] <scottjehl> hey _nickel
[13:22:40] <_nickel> scottjehl: yessir
[13:22:51] <scottjehl> I think we need a slight tweak to the history stack to fully clean up after ourselves
[13:23:06] <_nickel> removing the page in said stack :D
[13:23:13] <_nickel> good looking out
[13:24:11] <_nickel> or rather the reference to the page
[13:24:12] <_nickel> hmm
[13:24:19] <_nickel> I think it uses that reference though
[13:27:12] <scottjehl> yeah... it's more that we're still referencing the object
[13:27:19] <scottjehl> so it's probably not garb collected at all
[13:27:21] <scottjehl> right?
[13:27:32] <scottjehl> it's detatched but not removed
[13:38:56] <_nickel> correct
[13:39:02] <_nickel> memory bloat :(
[13:39:17] <_nickel> but there are instances where it requires the information when going backwards I think
[13:39:20] <_nickel> and forwards
[13:39:25] <_nickel> I'm going to get some food I'll be back in 20
[13:39:46] <scottjehl> I think we need a selector reference, but not a page object reference
[14:42:07] <scottjehl> _nickel I think we should look into this more over the weekend
[14:42:14] <_nickel> scottjehl: the nav?
[14:42:17] <scottjehl> gotta run, but I'll talk to you all later!
[14:42:25] <scottjehl> umm yeah the memory
[14:42:32] <scottjehl> dom references
[14:42:36] <_nickel> scottjehl: agreed
[14:42:43] <_nickel> scottjehl: I think we can distill what nave needs from the page
[14:42:44] <scottjehl> whether they're truly hanging around too long
[14:42:54] <_nickel> s/nave/nav/
[14:43:02] <scottjehl> it may be that Kin kept a pointer to the object for speed
[14:43:11] <scottjehl> we'll need to just re-look it up via selector
[14:43:28] <scottjehl> slower, but much better after removal
[16:36:53] <_nickel> toddparker: aww I was hoping to catch scott while he was on the bus :D
