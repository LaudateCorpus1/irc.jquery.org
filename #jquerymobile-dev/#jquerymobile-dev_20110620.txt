[07:55:12] <toddparker> hey all
[07:55:15] <toddparker> beta day!
[08:30:05] <gseguin> Good morning!
[08:42:09] <scottjehl> big day woo
[08:42:31] <gseguin> yay!
[08:44:11] <gseguin> scottjehl: ever figured out what's going on with the tests?
[08:44:36] <scottjehl> not yet. It's a timing thing with the tests themselves tho
[08:44:47] <scottjehl> any change you'd have time to take a look this morning?
[08:44:50] <scottjehl> no big deal if not :)
[08:45:52] <gseguin> I looked at them but this is not the kind of test where you can use the pageSequence helper
[08:46:15] <gseguin> 'cause there is no page change
[08:47:12] <scottjehl> ah right. yeah that makes sense
[08:47:25] <scottjehl> the bummer is I can usually get them to pass on refresh
[08:47:31] <scottjehl> it's a sequence thing
[08:47:57] <gseguin> I have to finish one thing here, I'll try to take a look afterward
[09:01:18] <scottjehl> hey kinblas
[09:20:29] <kinblas> scottjehl: hey
[09:20:36] <scottjehl> :)
[09:22:46] <kinblas> scottjehl: sorry my irc client was freaking out
[09:22:55] <kinblas> scottjehl: so I didn't see anything if you said something
[09:23:06] <scottjehl> nope, just a smiley
[09:23:07] * kinblas notes his weekend went nothing like he expected
[09:23:08] <scottjehl> :)
[09:23:22] <kinblas> scottjehl: busy bee this weekend
[09:23:39] <kinblas> struggling to catch up
[09:24:23] <scottjehl> yeah. trying to get the important stuff fixed.
[09:24:27] <scottjehl> I've got one blocker left
[09:24:28] <scottjehl> minor
[09:24:30] <scottjehl> :)
[09:25:11] <kinblas> which one?
[09:26:09] <kinblas> scottjehl: I must admit your navigation vclick change is making me nervous
[09:26:17] <kinblas> that's exactly how we had it for alpha 4
[09:26:19] <scottjehl> this mornings?
[09:26:42] <kinblas> no minus the config switch :-)
[09:26:48] <scottjehl> well, if it interferes with any custom widgets, its' a global option to disable
[09:26:50] <scottjehl> super easy
[09:26:57] <scottjehl> the benefits of enabling are large
[09:27:12] <kinblas> yeah I think it went along the lines of we wanted to flks to opt in because they were still making use of "click"
[09:27:43] <scottjehl> many more people see to care and complain about transitions smoothness
[09:28:07] <kinblas> scottjehl: heh, we'll see ... I'm just gun shy from alpha 4 experience
[09:28:08] <kinblas> :-)
[09:28:29] <kinblas> the config switch is a good out though
[09:28:34] <scottjehl> right right. of course, if you're using either of those events on an anchor that is going to use Ajax handling, you'll need to delegate off of something lower in the dom
[09:28:35] <scottjehl> right?
[09:28:53] <scottjehl> if you want to catch it and prevent bubbling, or anything like that
[09:28:58] <kinblas> I think part of the problem
[09:29:06] <scottjehl> so many use cases, but there are ways around it now
[09:29:08] <kinblas> was that folks were running on buggy Android 2.1
[09:29:36] <kinblas> where clicking on an element resulted in a touch that differed from what the mouse events were using
[09:29:43] <kinblas> well I shouldn't say buggy
[09:29:52] <kinblas>  because I think all of the webkit browsers show this to some degree
[09:30:00] <kinblas> Android 2.1 was just extreme
[09:30:14] * kinblas digs up a sample to show scott
[09:30:44] <scottjehl> thanks.
[09:31:05] <kinblas> here's one, and sorry for the long url
[09:31:06] <kinblas> http://webpro.host.adobe.com/people/jblas/research/events/touch-and-mouse.html
[09:31:12] <scottjehl> so far, Android 2.1 seems to be behaving well with the current setup, but I could be missing your use case
[09:32:10] <kinblas> try this one on Android 2.1
[09:32:11] <kinblas> http://webpro.host.adobe.com/people/jblas/research/events/touch-and-mouse3.html
[09:32:21] <kinblas> in the last url above
[09:32:27] <kinblas> click in the cyan area to the right
[09:32:35] <kinblas> the blue square is the actual link
[09:37:06] <scottjehl> yeah I remember these demos
[09:37:39] <scottjehl> so worst case, it'd result in a regular page change instead of ajax, right?
[09:37:56] <scottjehl> because click comes through separately of vclick
[09:38:28] <scottjehl> I pulled it out this morning, but I think I'll bring it back. I was binding to vclick and click when useFastClick is true
[09:38:41] <scottjehl> this would catch that edge case in android 2.1 I think
[09:38:49] <scottjehl> (unless I'm misunderstanding)
[09:45:49] <kinblas> scottjehl: I need to refresh myself with all the issues we closed ...  I just remember there was a very delicate balance that we were forced into to satisfy most and that's where we were at at alpha 4.1
[09:47:37] <kinblas> scottjehl: what was the blocker for the beta? Can I help/
[09:47:39] <kinblas> ??
[09:49:37] <scottjehl> umm. I'm testing a fix for this one right now: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1854
[09:49:43] <scottjehl> looking good :)
[09:49:56] <scottjehl> other beta blockers here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=5&state=open
[09:50:20] <scottjehl> I assigned that last one to you but I shouldn't have flagged it for beta
[09:50:29] <scottjehl> it's an old one I wanted to check with you on
[09:50:41] <scottjehl> that said, next on my list is the first one on that page
[09:51:18] <kinblas> oh yeah I saw something fly by over the weekend (on my phone)
[09:51:28] <kinblas> regarding the blur and active link
[09:51:39] <kinblas> I had added a performance comment in navigaiton .js
[09:51:52] <kinblas> why are we searching the pages for inputs etc to blur out
[09:52:15] <kinblas> why don't we just bind to focus/blur at the document and watch for the events and just track last item to get it?
[09:52:18] <scottjehl> just anchors that were programatically focused. Maybe our blur on pagechange isn't working
[09:52:40] <scottjehl> basically, when that line wasn't in there, we'd have a trail of focus states from everything ever visited
[09:52:54] <scottjehl> so, buttons weren't being blurred
[09:52:59] <scottjehl> when another is focused
[09:53:02] <kinblas> oh hmmm
[09:53:12] <kinblas> I wonder if you can't programatically blur/focs a display none element
[09:53:39] <kinblas> perhaps the thing to do is blur *before transitioning
[09:53:42] <kinblas> and focus after
[09:54:00] * kinblas checks if we're doing that already
[09:54:03] <scottjehl> yeah. wanna take a look?
[09:54:05] <scottjehl> we should be
[09:54:14] <scottjehl> but maybe we're only blurring inputs
[09:54:16] <scottjehl> to kill keyboard
[09:54:23] <scottjehl> adding anchors to that would help
[09:54:40] <scottjehl> (and removing the line I added yesterday if we can get that in place)
[09:55:48] <kinblas> we are blurring all .ui-btn in vclick
[09:55:59] <kinblas> and then in changePage we are blurring
[09:56:01] <kinblas> 		$( document.activeElement || "" ).add( "input:focus, textarea:focus, select:focus" ).blur();
[09:57:54] <scottjehl> hm yah
[09:58:01] <scottjehl> maybe pull the one out in vclick
[09:58:04] <scottjehl> and do it in one place?
[09:58:12] <kinblas> yeah that would be good
[09:58:21] <kinblas> what I was most concerned about was the searching through the page
[09:58:22] <scottjehl> a:focus to that list in the second?
[09:58:43] <scottjehl> yeah... dunno how to avoid that aside from caching the last programatically focused item?
[09:59:39] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah that's what I was thinking
[09:59:45] <kinblas> listening at document level for focus/blur
[09:59:53] <kinblas> we can try that out beta2
[09:59:55] <scottjehl> another $.mobile item? :)
[10:00:08] <kinblas> but it's just one of those perforance things on my list
[10:00:31] <scottjehl> for now, adding a:focus to that list and removing the other two blurs. Quick fix?
[10:01:36] <kinblas> yeah for now, I'd want to test the other approach for at least a couple of days
[10:01:43] <kinblas> not on the day we ship :-)
[10:03:22] <scottjehl> sure thing
[10:03:32] <scottjehl> so you're looking at that then/
[10:03:33] <scottjehl> ?
[10:03:38] <kinblas> scottjehl: we can also bump this to beta or just before release:
[10:03:38] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1373
[10:05:26] <scottjehl> bump to post-beta you mean?
[10:05:29] <kinblas> scottjehl: grr, having irc problems
[10:05:37] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah it's not a blocker
[10:05:41] <scottjehl> sounds good
[10:05:44] <scottjehl> unassigning
[10:05:58] <kinblas> so what were you asking prior to that?
[10:06:05] <kinblas> I lost all context due to my restart of irc
[10:06:38] <scottjehl> just checking if you're looking at the blur thing now
[10:07:13] <kinblas> so you wanted me to add a:focus to the one in the main vclick/click function?
[10:07:25] <kinblas> oh hmmm I meant changePage()
[10:08:56] <scottjehl> blur first maybe?
[10:09:04] <scottjehl> I'm fixing that page height one now
[10:09:09] <scottjehl> which deals with transitions
[10:09:32] <toddparker> sgesuin - you are now a committer. congrats!
[10:09:39] <toddparker> gseguin
[10:09:40] <gseguin> just saw that!
[10:09:45] <gseguin> woohoo!
[10:09:51] <gseguin> thanks
[10:09:55] <toddparker> darn typo on such a big occasion
[10:10:00] <toddparker> you deserve it
[10:10:07] <toddparker> no go fix something!
[10:10:13] <kinblas> heh
[10:10:16] <gseguin> :)
[10:10:27] <scottjehl> hey congrats!
[10:10:28] <scottjehl> :)
[10:10:30] <toddparker> man, the beta 1 blog post is epic!
[10:10:44] <toddparker> so all this stuff about the vclick binding for the hide url
[10:10:54] <toddparker> where should i list that in the upgrade notes
[10:11:13] <scottjehl> Kin, I'll test the vclick stuff in Android 2.1 now to decide if adding click along with vclick is a good idea
[10:11:24] <kinblas> scottjehl: ok
[10:11:49] <gseguin> Yeah I was just reading through it, nice post!
[10:11:50] <kinblas> so is Todd's 1840 what you are really after?
[10:12:16] <toddparker> thanks gseguin
[10:12:51] <toddparker> is the vclcik thing a breaking change or ust a take note kind fo thing
[10:13:39] <scottjehl> shouldn't be breaking. like anything though, those doing custom event handling on top of our ajax could get a conflict that requires them to disable it
[10:13:43] <scottjehl> hard to say
[10:15:15] <kinblas> toddparker: we'll know quickly after the release ;-)
[10:15:58] <kinblas> scottjehl: so looking at where you placed the blur in yesterday's checkin ... it looks about right
[10:16:18] <kinblas> if you are clicking on a link, you want to blur whatever is currently focused
[10:17:06] <scottjehl> hmm. that was more when removing the activestate class though, wasn't it/
[10:17:20] <scottjehl> I think it was in the wrong place. ..
[10:19:52] <kinblas> oh heh, I see what staab was saying
[10:20:09] <kinblas> we aren't distinguishing between a focused button and a non-focused one
[10:22:18] <kinblas> scottjehl: so is the tightening up there
[10:22:21] <kinblas> .ui-btn:focus?
[10:22:52] <scottjehl> umm. I think he was suggesting not calling focus on every anchor, yeah
[10:23:18] <scottjehl> it could even be a:focus, right?
[10:23:31] <scottjehl> this is only a navigation links issue. not forms
[10:24:18] <kinblas> so we have links inside buttons?
[10:25:08] <scottjehl> yeah, like in listviews
[10:26:06] <kinblas> $( "." + $.mobile.activePageClass + " .ui-btn:focus" ).not( $( link ).closest( ".ui-butn" ) ).blur();
[10:33:21] <scottjehl> ".ui-butn"
[10:33:26] <scottjehl> typo
[10:33:31] <kinblas> lol
[10:33:32] <kinblas> yeah
[10:33:49] <kinblas> I was looking for confirmation of whether or not that is what you guys were talking about
[10:34:02] <kinblas> btw, I still things slightly gray (following Todd's recipe)
[10:34:05] <kinblas> even with your fix
[10:34:10] <kinblas> the gray seems to be due to the hover
[10:34:12] <kinblas> color
[10:34:30] <scottjehl> hmm yeah I mean, that's another route we could go. removing hover
[10:34:35] <scottjehl> but it's lettered classnames
[10:34:38] <scottjehl> tedious
[10:34:41] <kinblas> ew
[10:34:53] <kinblas> so the hover is cleaned up on focus/blur?
[10:35:01] <scottjehl> yep
[10:35:02] * kinblas looks at buttonMarkup
[10:35:08] <scottjehl> hey good news
[10:35:11] <kinblas> ok so that's why you were going after that
[10:35:17] <scottjehl> we definitely need that click fallback for 2.1
[10:35:32] <scottjehl> makes things work great in that edge case where click arrives independently
[10:35:41] <kinblas> heh, that's good news?
[10:35:58] <scottjehl> good news in that adding it protects us
[10:36:01] <scottjehl> works well
[10:36:12] <kinblas> I don't think there's anything you can say that will be comforting till after about a week of this beta :-P
[10:42:13] <scottjehl> as soon as I push this, I'm going to take a look at IE, where we seem to have a JS error (only on desktop)
[10:44:05] <kinblas> so scott
[10:44:08] <scottjehl> yes
[10:44:20] <kinblas> my testing shows that focus/blur is not dispatched until after mousedown
[10:44:36] <kinblas> that is after touchstart/touchend
[10:44:41] <kinblas> and after vclick
[10:44:45] <scottjehl> hm ok
[10:45:23] <kinblas> that's for all elements I tried inputs/links
[10:47:04] <kinblas> grrr mirc is acting wonky
[10:55:25] <scottjehl> Kin, file this one for later but I think the fixed headers have some resize throttling that could just bind to the new throttledresize event.
[10:55:46] <scottjehl> seeing major perf improvements in IE with that in place, btw
[10:58:10] <kinblas> ok
[10:59:36] <kinblas> scottjehl: sorry, I'm slow today ... I'm not seeing a difference in behavior with or without your blur fix
[10:59:48] <kinblas> am I not seeing the thing you fixed yesterday?
[11:01:49] <scottjehl> it's very faint, but you should see the hover state stick around, ios and chrome for sure
[11:02:12] <scottjehl> need to visit a page, go back, scroll down, click another, go back
[11:02:19] <scottjehl> eventially the start page will be gray
[11:02:31] <scottjehl> just landed by last beta blocker btw
[11:02:33] <scottjehl> :)
[11:02:39] <scottjehl> we're in testing mode here
[11:02:46] <scottjehl> IE desktop is back
[11:03:17] <scottjehl> (i was checking scrollTop before body was present, and IE uses body for scrollTop internally in jq core, so it was throwing an undefined error)
[11:03:23] <scottjehl> moved to domready, good to go
[11:03:56] <scottjehl> (btw - calling scrollTop early to find out which address bar hiding number is in play - android or ios)
[11:05:42] <kinblas> scottjehl: Yeah I see the hover state stick around with/without your fix that's why I was wondering if I was looking at the right thing.
[11:05:48] <kinblas> I'm testing on iPod/iPad
[11:07:22] <kinblas> scottjehl: another thing I'm noticing, at least from the document element persepective, only focus events are bubbling up
[11:09:01] <kinblas> heh strike that last statement, I was printing "focus" for both console.log() messages.
[11:28:50] <kinblas> scottjehl: I think there's more to that focus/blur bug
[11:28:59] <kinblas> when you have time ping me
[11:29:07] <kinblas> I'll explain why
[11:29:25] <kinblas> or maybe I'll just put it in the bug
[11:31:25] <scottjehl> kinblas: sounds good
[11:31:39] <scottjehl> are you able to still prevent the sticking hover states for beta tho?
[11:31:48] <kinblas> no
[11:31:54] <kinblas> let me comment
[11:31:59] <scottjehl> we can keep my change if needed can't we? just needed optimization
[11:32:00] <kinblas> in the issue
[11:32:17] <kinblas> your change doesn't really do anything, at least for me,
[11:32:20] <scottjehl> I mean, it worked around the issue at least
[11:32:26] <scottjehl> oh?
[11:32:29] <kinblas> I'm not seeing that for some reason
[11:32:31] <scottjehl> definitely works for me
[11:32:40] <kinblas> hang on let me comment and then we can talk about
[11:32:40] <kinblas> it
[11:48:48] <kinblas> scottjehl: ok updated the issue with comments
[11:48:49] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1855
[12:02:21] <toddparker> Since we just closed out last blocker for Beta 1, please try to test jquerymobile/test/ on as many devices as you can in the next hour or so to see if there are are major regressions or issues.
[12:04:33] <_nickel> kinblas: so I think i found the issue with the nav test
[12:22:22] <scottjehl> _nickel: what'd you find?
[12:23:11] <_nickel> scottjehl: Kin changed the index I think
[12:23:17] <_nickel> scottjehl: still need to check with him why
[12:23:28] <_nickel> you can see in the comments that its meant to be 3
[12:23:42] <_nickel> but I think another one of his additions was adding a stack entry
[12:23:46] <_nickel> history stack entry that it
[12:23:46] <_nickel> *is
[12:23:56] <_nickel> so the index was +1
[12:24:15] <_nickel> and it needs to be reset to nothing for the test
[12:24:15] <_nickel> it appears to be working when I make sure that its set to []
[12:25:13] <_nickel> makes sense
[12:26:02] <scottjehl> hmm I think this is a different test than the one I was seeing fail
[12:26:16] <scottjehl> ...related to throttledresize, in the events suite
[12:28:52] <_nickel> scottjehl: right there are three failures that I'm seeing there
[12:29:14] <scottjehl> sometimes 1. often none. on refresh :/
[12:29:21] <_nickel> scottjehl: I'm starting to think long term about these tests and I keep coming back to the fact that we need to exten qunit to do a couple things
[12:29:37] <_nickel> one of the biggest problems is state management
[12:29:46] <_nickel> generally you want to avoid doing that manually
[12:30:25] <_nickel> qunit handles dom state managment as long as you keep your fixtures in a div with the qunit-fixtures (i think) class
[12:30:33] <_nickel> it would be nice to have it manage everything
[12:30:37] <_nickel> from the dom to the page title
[12:30:56] <_nickel> and even give it functions that its needs to reset if you monkey patch them
[12:35:55] <kinblas> _nickel: what did you find?
[12:36:28] <_nickel> kinblas: the index that was in that test originally was correct
[12:36:43] <_nickel> kinblas: the stack is getting an extra entry somewhere before the test runs
[12:36:50] <kinblas> oh hmmm
[12:36:57] <_nickel> so I just clear it explicityly in the test
[12:37:03] <_nickel> going to find where though before I commit
[12:37:10] <kinblas> well isn't the first item in the stack the default first page?
[12:37:13] <_nickel> the tests before it should really be moved over to the pageSeq helper
[12:37:39] <_nickel> kinblas: I think so, but I want a clean slate so that its obvious what the index should be
[12:37:53] <_nickel> I could remove everything but the first entry but that would be more confusing
[12:38:01] <_nickel> and it doesn't reset across tests unless I reset it manually
[12:38:16] <_nickel> since we're working on a single page
[12:38:24] <_nickel> state management
[12:38:30] <_nickel> its whats for dinner :/
[12:39:07] <_nickel> I've got a laundry list of things we could use, one of which is some helpers in qunit for managing state in the test lifecycle outside the dom (which qunit already handles)
[12:39:22] <kinblas> ok ... I just want to make sure I didn't screw up the stack management for real
[12:39:28] <scottjehl> we should probably get joern involved at some point
[12:39:34] <_nickel> kinblas: you didn't
[12:39:40] <kinblas> whew
[12:39:42] <_nickel> kinblas: I spent about an hour making sure :D
[12:39:42] <scottjehl> just in case he has ideas for handling some of the things you need already
[12:39:46] <kinblas> heh
[12:39:49] <_nickel> scottjehl: yap!
[12:40:00] <_nickel> scottjehl: he asked me when I started on the project if I had anything I thought could be added
[12:40:06] <scottjehl> awesome
[12:40:08] <kinblas> scottjehl: did you see my comments?
[12:40:13] <scottjehl> I think we're behind on versions too ya?
[12:40:21] <scottjehl> of qunit
[12:40:27] <scottjehl> no big deal
[12:40:29] <scottjehl> if we are
[12:40:59] <scottjehl> hey Kin, yeah I saw
[12:41:01] <scottjehl> great info
[12:41:06] <kinblas> scottjehl: I'm not sure what we should do
[12:41:11] <scottjehl> I'm not sure why it's working for me still
[12:41:13] <kinblas> for this round that is
[12:42:31] <scottjehl> well, what's the drawback right now? slightly greedier lookup is all right?
[12:42:42] <scottjehl> i mean, where it's working at least
[12:44:49] <kinblas> I should walk through why your fix isn't working for me
[12:44:56] * kinblas debugs
[12:53:20] <_nickel> ok nav is green for me in chrome and ff I'm pushing
[12:56:16] <scottjehl> nice!
[12:58:22] <_nickel> arg
[12:58:32] <_nickel> the wifi at the honda repair center is blocking port 22
[12:58:34] <_nickel> :(
[12:58:49] <_nickel> although I did a fetch
[13:01:06] <_nickel> ugh it will have to wait until I get home
[13:20:08] <_nickel> w00t down to the even failures :D
[13:20:11] <_nickel> *event
[13:22:25] <_nickel> scottjehl: kinblas: ^
[13:23:10] <gseguin> Well done _nickel!
[13:23:59] <_nickel> gseguin: :D
[13:24:02] <_nickel> good things are good
[13:54:36] <kinblas> scottjehl: ping
[13:56:57] <_nickel_> scottjehl: double ping I have a question about your throttled even tests when you get a sec
[14:08:56] <_nickel_> scottjehl: we needed a default page for the events test, that was causing the inconsistency
[14:09:13] <_nickel_> scottjehl: nevermind I lied
[14:30:02] <scottjehl> _nickel hey sorry
[14:30:10] <scottjehl> any progress on that?
[14:30:42] <_nickel_> scottjehl: yah the bound functions are firing more than they should in some isntance
[14:30:49] <_nickel_> *some instances just figuring out why
[14:55:38] <kinblas> scottjehl: just an FYI
[14:55:46] <kinblas> I haven't changed anything in terms of that focus/blur bug
[14:56:49] <kinblas> I was trying to understand why the vclick click change breaks the focus/blur dispatching
[14:59:09] <scottjehl> ok
[14:59:15] <scottjehl> yeah. it's an odd one
[14:59:19] <scottjehl> I'm not seeing it now though
[14:59:56] <kinblas> scottjehl: Just so you know with that proposed fix from staab
[15:00:02] <kinblas> I was getting exactly zero matches
[15:00:07] <kinblas> so that wasn't helping things at all
[15:00:28] <kinblas> we're still firing n blurs for each click, where n is the number of .ui-btn on the page
[15:04:00] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: it might be good to get those throttledresize tests passing
[15:04:07] <_nickel> before we stamp it good for b1
[15:05:15] <_nickel> scottjehl: if you have time to look at it I've moved it over to the vanilla seq helper, and I've got some logging in there to highlight the event triggers
[15:05:54] <kinblas> scottjehl: found a stray semicolon we need to remove
[15:11:55] <_nickel> kinblas: linted?
[15:13:01] <kinblas> jshinted
[15:13:52] <kinblas> most of our errors in navigation.js are due to things declared out of order ... functions that use things that are declared after that function.
[15:13:52] <_nickel> kinblas: by chance are you using the service???!?!
[15:14:04] <kinblas> _nickel: unfortunately not
[15:14:10] <kinblas> I cut/paste into jshint.com
[15:14:11] * _nickel is crestfallen 
[15:14:15] <_nickel> hahah
[15:14:21] <kinblas> I was in a hurry :-P
[15:14:30] <_nickel> hey man I'm glad we're doing it!
[15:14:36] <_nickel> paste or otherwise
[15:14:47] <kinblas> I keep getting bitten by my stupid muscle memory for typing semi-colons
[15:15:03] <kinblas> .. that doesn't fly in the middle of a var decl that spans multiple lines
[15:15:08] <_nickel> :D
[15:15:09] <kinblas> as you've pointed out to me before
[15:15:10] <kinblas> :-P
[15:15:13] <_nickel> globals! rawr!
[15:15:47] <kinblas> ever since you pointed that out, I'm paranoid, so of course I jshint, and of course I did introduce another one
[15:15:49] <kinblas> < sigh >
[15:16:00] <_nickel> ah well
[15:16:31] <_nickel> one more thing I'd like to do for the project and js devs at large
[15:16:47] <_nickel> hint/lint editor integration
[15:17:22] <kinblas> and of course as I casually glance over the source, I see something I should change after beta branches
[15:21:30] <gseguin> _nickel: textmate has a jshint bundle
[15:23:47] <gseguin> _nickel: is your jshint hook in place?
[15:24:39] <_nickel> gseguin: not sure what you mean, I'm using it locally
[15:24:56] <gseguin> oh just in your git repo?
[15:25:04] <_nickel> the hook
[15:25:14] <_nickel> I haven't deployed your changes yet I don't think
[15:25:30] <gseguin> what do you mean by locally?
[15:26:15] <gseguin> do you mean on your local git repo, or on the CI server?
[15:28:31] <gseguin> I've got JSHint running as a QUnit test suite here if that's of interest for jQM CI
[15:45:12] <_nickel> gseguin: yah it would be nice to integrate into the ci
[15:45:29] <_nickel> gseguin: I just meant that I'm using the pre-commit hook
[15:47:50] <gseguin> _nickel: we run our QUnit test suites with PhantomJS and a test runner that extends QUnit hooks to output JUnit XML
[15:49:13] <_nickel> gseguin: we'll need that, one of the things I want to do is get code coverage numbers and it looks like that is easier to do outside the browser
[15:50:09] <_nickel> gseguin: the expresso node testing library uses a coverage library I want to use
[15:50:26] <_nickel> obviously thats really only good for coverage numbers and a basic test though
[15:50:39] <_nickel> what we need ultimatley is a testswarm setup
[15:50:46] * gseguin looking into expresso
[15:50:46] <_nickel> many many todo's
[15:51:12] <_nickel> gseguin: also I've been thinking things like testswarm etc should be in something other than php
[15:51:53] <_nickel> I'm tempted to use node except that I don't think its a skillset thats as well known even if it would mean turtles the whole way down
[15:52:01] <_nickel> which would be a win in consistency
[15:52:42] <gseguin> consistency is good
[15:53:34] <_nickel> gseguin: I think as time goes on that step is inevitable
[15:53:40] <_nickel> especially with node stabalizing
[15:54:21] <gseguin> so expresso means getting rid of QUnit?
[15:54:48] <gseguin> _nickel: ^^^
[15:54:48] <_nickel> gseguin: oh no
[15:54:53] <gseguin> oh ok
[15:54:58] <_nickel> gseguin: just leveraging the library they use for code coverage
[15:55:02] <_nickel> its a seperate node project
[15:55:12] <scottjehl> so I just pushed the new docs site, folks
[15:55:19] <scottjehl> should be on test shortly
[15:55:32] <gseguin> _nickel: just using the code coverage part of it
[15:56:22] <_nickel> scottjehl: do you want to see whats going on with the throttledresize with my logging and changes in? I can push to a branch on my fork
[15:56:31] <_nickel> gseguin: https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage
[15:58:21] <gseguin> _nickel: I'll look into as we might need it at Jive as well
[15:58:27] <gseguin> *into it
[16:09:25] <scottjehl> IT'S HAPPENING
[16:09:27] <scottjehl> :)
[16:09:46] <gseguin> I saw John's commit
[16:11:28] <scottjehl> hope you guys like the new site on desktop
[16:11:34] <scottjehl> seems to test out well :)
[16:13:30] <gseguin> yeah, it's nice!
[16:15:05] <erichynds> congrats guys
[16:21:51] <scottjehl> hey thanks, erichynds. Definitely was great to have you helping on all those selectmenu features:)
[16:26:38] <erichynds> np! now that i'm back working on mobile stuff hopefully i'll be able to contribute more
[18:18:33] <scottjehl> beta 1 released!
[18:18:52] <scottjehl> http://jquerymobile.com
[21:24:00] <gseguin> _nickel: You come by multiple of 3 now?
[21:24:38] <_nickel_> _nickel_: ugh yah the damn internet at the honde service center kept bouncing me brb
[21:24:47] <_nickel_> gseguin: ^ lol
[21:25:22] <gseguin> :)
