[04:44:54] <toddmparker> RWhitbeck: Targeting Monday for 1.3
[05:00:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: good morning
[05:00:13] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:00:39] <arschmitz> sorry i didnt get to that fix in the widget yet yesterday was kinda crazy
[05:00:49] <arschmitz> im actually back at work today though 
[05:00:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no worries
[05:01:29] <arschmitz> i was scanning yesterday real quick though and you saw another bug ?
[05:02:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it's with multipage templates
[05:02:26] <uGoMobi> like here http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/popups/dynamic-popup.html
[05:02:41] <arschmitz> we already talked about that one i already have it fixed local just working on making panel auto close when clicked
[05:02:54] <arschmitz> was there something else?
[05:03:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, ah cool you got it fixed
[05:03:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, nothing else
[05:03:26] <arschmitz> yeah just a messed up if statement 
[05:03:44] <arschmitz> but _|Nix|_: was saying he thought following a link in the panel should close the panel
[05:03:47] <arschmitz> and i tend to agree
[05:03:54] <arschmitz> so im working on fixing that
[05:04:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh wait, the buttons in the section nav panel keep active state
[05:04:13] <uGoMobi> yes, auto close panel
[05:04:51] <uGoMobi> not sure why the buttons keep the active state... might be framework bug
[05:05:05] <arschmitz> hmm yeah thats because it never gets removed in the nav ill have to do it manually after scroll
[05:05:12] <arschmitz> when i close the panel
[05:05:37] <uGoMobi> so auto close + remove active state and it should all be fine
[05:05:39] <arschmitz> thats easy enough though
[05:05:43] <arschmitz> yup
[05:05:55] <uGoMobi> I will look at the global nav
[05:06:04] <uGoMobi> relative path of the links etc
[05:06:05] <arschmitz> oh i had an idea for that!
[05:06:25] <arschmitz> i just havent had a chance to try it yet give me a sec to see if it will work in theory lol
[05:07:27] <uGoMobi> sure, take your time
[05:07:40] <arschmitz> oh yup this should be perfect
[05:07:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how are things going at home and in hospital?
[05:08:15] <arschmitz> home is good got everything straightened out last two days
[05:08:23] <arschmitz> wife is home and doing good
[05:08:34] <uGoMobi> good to hear that
[05:08:41] <arschmitz> Deaglan will be in hospital untill at least sunday
[05:08:53] <arschmitz> but hes doing great
[05:09:07] <arschmitz> had something a little crazy happen yesterday though
[05:09:08] <uGoMobi> awesome
[05:09:55] <uGoMobi> what happened?
[05:10:10] <arschmitz> The CDC (Center for Disease Control) had to come check him out
[05:10:51] <arschmitz> when they ran blood tests the day he was born they found a bacteria in his blood and they could not identify it
[05:11:27] <uGoMobi> hmm... they found out yet?
[05:11:35] <arschmitz> but they said that its fine that he shows no sign of any sort of infection and that they are pretty sure its cross contamination 
[05:12:13] <arschmitz> but as a precaution any time they cant identify a bacteria they keep them on antibiotics for 10 days ( thats why hes there until at least sunday )
[05:12:52] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:13:08] <arschmitz> Thank you for asking :)
[05:13:20] <uGoMobi> :)
[05:13:39] <arschmitz> ok so for the global nav panel i have an idea that should work
[05:13:47] <uGoMobi> ok tell me
[05:13:52] <arschmitz> make all the links relative to the demos root 
[05:13:58] <arschmitz> then
[05:14:36] <arschmitz> on pagechange loop through the links and prepend the current basetag value
[05:15:12] <arschmitz> but trim off anything after the demos folder
[05:17:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: does that make sense?
[05:18:03] <uGoMobi> I am thinking
[05:18:40] <uGoMobi> the basetag will be something like localhost/jqm-folder/
[05:18:43] <uGoMobi> right?
[05:19:00] <arschmitz> right lets say we are at http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/buttons/
[05:19:07] <arschmitz> the base tag will be http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/buttons/
[05:19:14] <uGoMobi> and the path we use for the links should be demos/widget/buttons/
[05:19:30] <uGoMobi> not ../../buttons
[05:19:39] <arschmitz> right
[05:20:24] <uGoMobi> yeah that sounds fine
[05:20:46] <arschmitz> yeah we will just have to take the basetag and split it at demos
[05:21:05] <arschmitz> and append the link to it
[05:21:29] <arschmitz> then it will work as long as js is enabled
[05:21:45] <arschmitz> no js your just bumming lol 
[05:22:10] <uGoMobi> no js and you won't have much fun when browsing demos anyway
[05:22:42] <arschmitz> right
[05:23:34] <uGoMobi> i will start with updating the nav.html file after i finished the demos i am working on
[05:26:53] <arschmitz> awesome
[05:27:14] <arschmitz> i think ill just make it an extension to the panel widget that does it on panel create
[05:27:31] <arschmitz> if you set data-global-nav="true"
[05:28:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so if you want to add that to the panel when you update links that would be cool 
[05:30:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure will add that data- attribute
[05:30:44] <arschmitz> thanks 
[05:36:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: deeplink_click_handler.js can be removed, right?
[05:36:28] <uGoMobi> that code is in the h2widget now I think
[05:36:46] <arschmitz> yes i have it removed locally :)
[05:36:51] <arschmitz> just havent pushed that yet
[05:36:59] <arschmitz> so feel free to remove

[07:32:23] <gseguin> mornin' all
[07:32:51] <arschmitz> morning gseguin
[07:37:44] <RWhitbeck> toddmparker you around?
[07:38:34] <arschmitz> Hey RWhitbeck: i havent seen him about yet today
[07:38:47] <RWhitbeck> ok thanks
[08:32:32] <toddmparker> Hey RWhitbeck 
[08:32:40] <toddmparker> On for a minute
[08:32:45] <toddmparker> Subway
[08:33:17] <rwaldron> gseguin johnbender ping
[08:33:51] <toddmparker> Needing JS for local demos seems ok. It's a JS lib
[08:37:50] <toddmparker> Brb
[08:45:57] <gseguin> rwaldron: 'sup?
[08:46:35] <Wilto> rick is here be cool
[08:47:03] <gseguin> here as in: at Filament?
[08:47:17] <Wilto> ‚ÄúHere‚Äù as in ‚Äúhe‚Äôs listening.‚Äù
[08:47:19] <rwaldron> gseguin hi!
[08:47:28] <Wilto> always listening
[08:47:31] <Wilto> waiting
[08:47:34] <rwaldron> is jQuery Mobile using jQuery._data or jQuery._removeData at all?
[08:47:39] <gseguin> rwaldron: hi!
[08:48:03] <gseguin> rwaldron: I doubt it, though I'm not 100% sure
[08:48:36] <Wilto> I second that. Pretty sure we aren‚Äôt.
[08:49:17] <rwaldron> greay
[08:49:19] <rwaldron> great
[08:49:20] <gseguin> just grepped and didn't find any occurence
[08:49:30] <rwaldron> are you guys testing against jQuery 2.0 yet?
[08:49:36] <rwaldron> gseguin awesome!
[08:49:57] <gseguin> I think part of the testing is against jquery-git, is that 2.0pre ?
[08:50:37] <gseguin> though that's a question for johnbender
[09:03:57] <johnbender> rwaldron: pong
[09:03:59] <johnbender> gseguin: pong
[09:04:21] <johnbender> rwaldron: we are testing against git
[09:04:35] <johnbender> and I seriously doubt we use _data or _removeData
[09:04:44] <gseguin> johnbender: we're not
[09:05:40] <johnbender> gseguin: testing or using _*
[09:05:56] <gseguin> johnbender: using _*
[09:06:01] <johnbender> cool
[09:07:08] <johnbender> whoa
[09:07:09] <johnbender> opera
[09:07:40] <rwaldron> johnbender great thanks!
[09:12:55] <johnbender> rwaldron: np np :)
[09:18:44] <toddmparker> johnbender: so core git = 2.0
[09:18:50] <toddmparker> is 1.9 a branch?
[09:19:18] <toddmparker> http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/technical-reference-intel-html5-app-porter-tool-beta
[09:19:21] <johnbender> toddmparker: I believe it's being maintained as a branch
[09:19:27] <toddmparker> A number of open source projects are used as foundation for the conversion including a modified version of Clang front-end, LayerD framework and jQuery Mobile* for widgets rendering in the translated source code.
[09:19:37] <toddmparker> are we testing that too?
[09:19:58] <toddmparker> seems like both need to be in heavy rotation
[09:20:27] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: you know anything about this Intel Porter thing?
[09:21:14] <johnbender> toddmparker: that's a good question
[09:21:32] <toddmparker> be good to look at that to make sure we're 100% square
[09:21:45] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: do you guys have a jquery-git equivalent for 1.9?
[09:23:58] <DaveMethvin> johnbender:at the moment, http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js is 1.9.2pre, http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git2.js is 2.0.0 pre
[09:24:55] <johnbender> rwaldron: in which case we are not testing against 2.0 :( :(
[09:25:00] <johnbender> but we can fix that quite easily
[09:27:22] <rwaldron> ok, no worries
[09:32:01] <arschmitz> toddmparker: so i fixed the h2widget and the problem with links in the nav panel
[09:39:43] <toddmparker> git2.js!
[09:40:06] <toddmparker> arschmitz: awesomsauce
[09:40:13] <toddmparker> that pushed?
[09:40:16] <arschmitz> yup
[09:40:32] <toddmparker> cool
[09:40:35] <toddmparker> lemme look
[09:41:52] <arschmitz> for the global nav panel i wrote an extension to panel that allows you to specify a folder name that all your links are relative to
[09:42:17] <arschmitz> if you set this option when the panel is created all links in it are made absolute relative to this folder
[09:46:24] <toddmparker> super so we can maintain a single include now
[09:46:39] <arschmitz> yup
[09:47:21] <arschmitz> debating if the extension is worth a demo or not
[09:47:49] <arschmitz> its kinda a sepcial use case where you dont know where your root is so you must use relative links
[10:01:55] <agcolom> toddmparker: hi, had a look at the blog post and all seems fine
[10:20:14] <toddmparker> arschmitz: be cool to make a demo explaining how we made the nav for the docs
[10:20:23] <arschmitz> yeah
[10:20:37] <arschmitz> also we need to add a note
[10:20:44] <arschmitz> to the readme probably
[10:20:55] <arschmitz> new versions of MAMP ignore .htaccess by default
[10:21:31] <arschmitz> figured that out the hard way after upgrading and tearing my hair out why the nav panel was not working lol
[10:23:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker: also for the release blog not sure if you only include devices that you actually have at filament or everything everyone has but i have a bunch of devices / os combos not on support  list currently
[10:23:22] <toddmparker> i didn't know that about mamp
[10:23:41] <arschmitz> toddmparker: its new in the latest version
[10:23:47] <toddmparker> feel free to shoot me other devices and i'll add 'em
[10:23:52] <arschmitz> cool
[10:24:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: are you around?
[10:24:21] <arschmitz> oh also if we ever need to test on surface pro my stepfather just got one so i can always bug him to check stuff
[10:24:31] <johnbender> gseguin: ping
[10:24:41] <johnbender> gseguin: actually its not important
[10:24:43] <johnbender> nevermind
[10:24:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ping
[10:24:45] <gseguin> pong?
[10:24:52] <johnbender> gseguin: no worries
[10:24:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: im not even going to try to justify why he got a surface pro lol ha ha 
[10:25:24] <johnbender> arschmitz: I want to get my dad one to see how he handles it
[10:25:28] <johnbender> he's a perfect guinea pig 
[10:26:11] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah my stepfather likes his so far he wanted it because it will be easy to use one handed while hes in server rooms and tight spaces like that
[10:26:47] <arschmitz> he owns a network and server administration and installation company
[10:34:19] <johnbender> arschmitz: the family that nerds together stays together
[10:34:44] <johnbender> * the family that nerds together herds together
[10:34:52] <arschmitz> johnbender: lol yeah my mother is a graphic designer and web developer and my brother is my assistant
[10:35:58] <arschmitz> so we keep it pretty neardy 
[10:36:46] <arschmitz> johnbender: speaking of nerdieness i saw something ammusing last week
[10:37:07] <arschmitz> johnbender: bill gates called steve jobs out for not being nerdy enough in an interview 
[10:37:16] <johnbender> lolol
[10:37:48] <arschmitz> yeah i was very ammused

[12:56:15] <agcolom> hi toddmparker!
[12:57:01] <agcolom> so I've started to tidy up the api docs... I had some old links that need removing...  
[12:57:13] <agcolom> Will do that until sunday... 
[12:58:00] <agcolom> I've got a really bad cold :-( which started at the weekend! Spent too much time in the cold! 
[12:58:34] <agcolom> So was totally unable to do anything monday and tuesday (apart from normal work)
[12:59:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this line in h2widget is causing a "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined" error https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/docs/demos/_assets/js/h2widget.js#L29 
[12:59:19] <agcolom> btw any of you been asked to review a book proposal for Manning on jQuery Mobile? (I need to submit my questionnaire tomorrow._
[12:59:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: where are you seeing it?
[12:59:55] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom , hope you feel better soon
[13:00:04] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Thanks :-) 
[13:00:26] <agcolom> The hard thing is I am struggling to breathe! It's horrible!
[13:00:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I got a request from a publisher in the UK to review a book but don't remember the name
[13:01:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see it on a demo I didn't push yet
[13:01:12] <agcolom> uGoMobi: oh, could be the same... jQuery Mobile in depth
[13:01:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: let me see if I can reproduce on /test/
[13:01:21] <arschmitz> ok
[13:01:28] <agcolom> it's only a book proposal for now... 
[13:01:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Packt Publishing Pvt Ltd. 
[13:01:43] <agcolom> but doesn;t seem to offer much much thatn the docs...
[13:01:47] <uGoMobi> different one
[13:01:54] <agcolom> uGoMobi: no, that's a different one then
[13:01:56] <arschmitz> agcolom: i got that one

[13:02:32] <arschmitz> i havent even had a chance to look at it yet but i was going to
[13:02:46] <agcolom> arschmitz: I'm not terribly impressed by the proposal... 
[13:03:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/popups/dynamic-popup.html#demo-page
[13:03:29] <uGoMobi> refresh the page and you see the error
[13:03:30] <agcolom> It's like he's proposing the make a book that will cover what hte docs cover... and a chapter on cordova...
[13:04:00] <agcolom> uGoMobi: so yours is a full book review?
[13:04:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: lame maybe i should look at it dont need another useless book for people to waste their money on
[13:04:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah
[13:04:38] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes, I think there is a need for books, but on the hard stuff.... 
[13:04:53] <agcolom> this one had advanced topic: using the themeroller!
[13:05:07] <arschmitz> not good!
[13:05:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill look at it right now
[13:05:52] <agcolom> I said I'd return my questionnaire tomorrow... I can send you a copy if you like, to see what you think?

[13:12:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[13:12:27] <johnbender> you can just add a line there to check for anything less than 7

[13:15:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Adding something to the ajaxBlacklist defined therein precludes it from being gradeA, so I need to adjust $.mobile.gradeA as well, right?
[13:15:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nope
[13:16:02] <johnbender> two different tests
[13:16:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[13:16:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: see jquery.mobile.init
[13:16:15] <johnbender> it just sets ajaxEnabled = false
[13:17:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[13:17:51] <agcolom> johnbender: oh no! I'm ill as well! It's horrible! 
[13:18:04] <johnbender> agcolom: yes, I hate being sick
[13:18:18] <johnbender> agcolom: get well soon :

[13:18:20] <uGoMobi> JQM virus? I had it last week :(

[13:36:03] <arschmitz> that is not the right commit message
[13:36:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that however does fix your issue with the error
[13:36:35] <arschmitz> johnbender: ping!
[13:36:43] <johnbender> arschmitz: pong
[13:36:53] <arschmitz> is there a way to change a commit message?
[13:37:07] <johnbender> arschmitz: if it only exists on your machine, yes
[13:37:15] <arschmitz> nope pushed 
[13:37:21] <arschmitz> just now
[13:37:21] <johnbender> you are out of luck then :)
[13:37:40] <arschmitz> damn the commit just above the that message makes no sense and has nothing to do with the commit
[13:37:59] <johnbender> arschmitz: that's ok, everyone does that 
[13:38:02] * johnbender shrugs
[13:38:33] <arschmitz> ok lol its a fix for clickhandelning in multi page template in the docs with the message" add box shadow and adjust image sizes"
[13:38:35] <arschmitz> lol
[13:39:00] <arschmitz> i need to go home and let my brain recoup lol
[13:39:26] <arschmitz> lack of sleep from being at hospital is getting to me
[13:41:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Turning off AJAX does not fix that bug. I'm assuming it's because it's happening with internal pages, so AJAX is not involved.
[13:41:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah, that's right
[13:41:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: alright
[13:42:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'll take over then
[13:42:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Since hashchange is not being fired, I'm thinking that the navigate event is not getting fired either, meaning that _handleHashChange() doesn't get called to change the page.
[13:42:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes
[13:42:35] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: there's a quick swap of the hash values that appears to be happening
[13:42:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yep.
[13:43:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I just make a quick logging facility with divs in the page
[13:43:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you want to you can keep monkeying around or I can take a look at it tomorrow
[13:43:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[13:44:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I wonder ... is IE7 considered to have a native hashchange event? I know there's some crazy iframe stuff in jquery.hashchange.js, but if the polling loop is in place then it should catch the change in the location.
[13:46:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Also - is there a newer version of jquery.hashchange.js?
[13:47:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no it doesn't support hashchange
[13:47:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's where the pollyfill comes in
[13:47:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: there might be
[13:47:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm still wondering if it's not our fault (setting the hash twice or something()
[13:47:49] <johnbender> I didn't rules that out completely yet
[13:48:05] <johnbender> though that seems unlikely
[13:49:32] <toddmparker> manning and packt will bombard you with requests to write or review books so don't let it distract 
[13:50:32] <agcolom> toddmparker: ok
[13:51:09] <johnbender> toddmparker: ?
[13:51:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I can add an alert every time we assign location.hash and see what happens.
[13:51:49] <toddmparker> agcolom and johnbender - feel better
[13:52:02] <toddmparker> sickness everywhere
[13:52:23] <toddmparker> agcolom: I appreciate your eyes on the demos, i know there are a lot of old links, bad language, etc.
[13:52:29] <agcolom> toddmparker: this was was a short book project. I only work on it on the train, when I can't do anything else... 
[13:52:47] <toddmparker> anyone else going to vienna next week?
[13:52:52] <toddmparker> i need to work on my preso
[13:53:05] <agcolom> me :-) (yes, I need to work on my preso too!)
[13:53:20] <toddmparker> oh, cool. we can hang out
[13:53:37] <agcolom> I'm doing it all in html5 slides! (to have iframes with lots of JQM demos ;-) )
[13:53:53] <agcolom> but all stored locally so should be fine! 
[13:54:01] <agcolom> when are you arriving?
[13:54:19] <agcolom> I'm arriving sometime thursday afternoon...
[13:55:38] <agcolom> toddmparker: if the new api docs tons of iframes are proven to be too heavy, I can merge some togehter which will help...
[13:57:22] <toddmparker> agcolom: me too. we built a simple slide deck with jQM
[13:57:45] <toddmparker> i arrive Thursday too
[13:58:01] <toddmparker> merging frames is a good idea
[13:58:13] <toddmparker> no rush, we can do that post 1.3 as an enhancement
[13:58:23] <agcolom> cool! yes, that's what I was thinking
[13:58:29] <toddmparker> rather get help on the site and demos if that's ok
[13:58:39] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's what I was doing, or similar
[13:58:52] <toddmparker> thinking the site won't switch on Monday but we can flip over the new demos and API site with 1.3
[13:59:05] <agcolom> yes, I'm currently reviewing the api docs widgets in reverse alphabetical order
[13:59:44] <agcolom> that sounds like a good plan
[14:00:02] <agcolom> where is that slide deck demo?
[14:07:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We're not doing anything wrong. I commented out the code in the jquery.hashchange.js that's supposed to be IE6/7/8-specific, and when you do hashchanges like that, it actually doesn't record them all. The back button still works buf for some reason it skips over #page3 ...
[14:08:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, it's "" -> page2 -> page3 -> /nix/jqm/5512.html -> page2 <- /nix/jqm/5512.html <- page2 <- ""
[14:08:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm, good to know
[14:09:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well then we were right to look in there
[14:09:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: maybe check for a new version?
[14:09:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was, but I couldn't find one.
[14:09:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll ask in #jquery-dev ...
[14:12:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There doesn't seem to be a newer version.

[14:13:35] <toddmparker> agcolom: been meaning to run a link checker on the new demos
[14:14:47] <toddmparker> http://validator.w3.org/checklink?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fjquerymobile.com%2Ftest%2Fdocs%2Fdemos%2F&hide_type=all&recursive=on&depth=5&check=Check
[14:15:54] <agcolom> That is fantastic! 
[14:17:56] <agcolom> ok, the rest for tomorrow.... 
[14:18:08] <agcolom> I love that link checking thing! 
[14:44:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: IE7 simply likes to inject #/path/to/page1.html a few times in between actual history events.
[14:45:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ... that makes sense :/
[14:45:26] <Wilto> Who doesn‚Äôt!
[14:45:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it could be something to do with the iframe business in hashchange
[14:45:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, and it injects it, but it reports the old hash value so the poller doesn't see a difference.
[14:45:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: For sure.
[14:45:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah that's what I saw
[14:45:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, if you remove it, it never reports any hash.
[14:46:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It simply lies.
[14:46:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmmm
[14:46:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The location bar displays one thing, but location.hash contains something else. Even location.href lies.
[14:46:30] <johnbender> not at all sure what to do here
[14:46:42] <johnbender> toddmparker: 
[14:46:48] <johnbender> ^
[14:46:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: This smells like grade C all over the place.
[14:47:01] <johnbender> indeed
[14:47:22] <johnbender> toddmparker: this is apparently _not_ a regression from 1.2.0
[14:47:26] <johnbender> it's been like this
[14:47:29] <_|Nix|_> I mean, if we can't reliably do our internal page thing then we're scr00d.
[14:47:34] <johnbender> yep
[14:47:58] <Wilto> ‚Ä¶do what now
[14:48:11] <Wilto> Catching up.
[14:48:23] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: #some-page doesn't always go back to #some-page.
[14:48:46] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Try this in IE7: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/5512.html
[14:48:47] <Wilto> That seems Less Than Ideal‚Ñ¢.
[14:49:17] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Go start -> page2 -> page3 -> page1 -> page2 and then keep going back, trying to reach the start page.
[14:49:23] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Watch the fireworks.
[14:50:16] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: That's Œµ below ideal.
[14:51:06] <Wilto> ‚Ä¶huh.
[14:51:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We could write an ActiveX control to access the text field containing the location and correctly update location.
[14:51:27] <Wilto> i feel faint
[14:51:46] <Wilto> coughdemoteIE7cough
[14:54:10] <_|Nix|_> Can we introduce another grade between b and c? One where the page paradigm doesn't work, but all the widgets do? Like, buttons are still nice, and custom selects and popups work, but all pages in a document show up below one another ... ?
[15:01:41] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/disapprove.gif
[15:01:55] <Wilto> I say ‚ÄúFULL DEMOTION.‚Äù
[15:01:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The funny thing is it only happens with internal pages.
[15:02:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It works fine with AJAX-ed in pages.
[15:02:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Maybe it's the combination of path and non-path hashes *shrug*
[15:03:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It's too much for IE7's simple little mind.
[15:26:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nope. Not even. It just breaks at internal pages.
[15:27:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm
[15:27:15] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: some conflict between the #id scroll and hashchange maybe?
[15:27:22] <johnbender> scrolling to something that's off screen?
[15:27:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Maybe ...
[15:27:52] <johnbender> who knows :(
[15:28:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Working around that would be a hell of a dance though ...
[15:29:14] <johnbender> indeed
[15:29:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... or we could simply document that if IE7 is part of the target audience then one should avoid multipage documents and simply go with AJAX *shrug*
[15:31:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I wonder if the fact that AJAX loading has a greater asynchronicity than going to an internal page has any influence ...
[15:31:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm
[15:31:43] <johnbender> yah the delay
[15:32:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Like, maybe in one case we're setting the hash in the same frame as the click whereas in the AJAX case we're setting it in a different frame.
[15:33:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... because loadPage completes synchronously.
[15:33:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: one way to test that is turn on dom caching for remote pages
[15:35:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can do.
[15:36:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if that causes the same issue it would be interesting to see if we could introduce an async delay for for the loadPage of local content
[15:36:08] <johnbender> that doesn't seem unreasonable to me
[15:38:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We'd need to pass a parameter to the .success() handler to indicate that it is completing synchronously.
[15:38:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I thought we could just make the page load async in both cases
[15:39:08] <johnbender> loading is async because of ajax
[15:39:21] <johnbender> returning the dom element could be async by setTimeout
[15:40:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I've turned on DOM caching. I'm checking it out now.
[15:44:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Seem to work - unless I've done something wrong ... I used the hashchange functional test and I went start -> page 2 -> page 3 -> page 1 -> page 2 -> page 3 -> page 1 -> page 2 and then back back back back ...
[15:44:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm interesting
[15:45:46] <toddmparker> _|nix|_ b grade is all widgets workibg but no Ajax nav
[15:45:59] <toddmparker> Wish granted
[15:46:36] <johnbender> toddmparker: still need to sort this issue out though
[15:47:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: There's actually no trouble with AJAX nav. It works fine. The nav to internal pages is broken.
[15:47:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's the twist!
[15:48:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The "easy" case is broken whereas the "more difficult" case works O_o
[15:49:12] <toddmparker> Odd
[15:49:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, grade b will not help here.
[15:49:30] <toddmparker> So does this only impact multipage?
[15:49:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It impacts it to the point of smashing it to smithereens.
[15:50:03] <toddmparker> Ah
[15:50:21] <toddmparker> I already had ie7 on as b grade
[15:50:28] <toddmparker> We could downgrade to c
[15:50:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Like, "Listen up, folks! Don't go multipage documenting if you plan on supporting IE7! Go forth and AJAX, y'all!"
[15:50:52] <toddmparker> johnbender: You said this isn't a regression? Like this in 1.2?
[15:50:59] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yep.
[15:51:18] <toddmparker> Hmm
[15:51:49] <toddmparker> So is it better to play it safe and downgrade to c or just document this limitation?
[15:52:26] <toddmparker> When it goes bad, what happens? Errors? Crashing?
[15:53:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No. Just no effect when clicking back.
[15:53:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: You have to click several times to get back to the previous page.
[15:53:38] <toddmparker> That doesn't sound so bad
[15:54:09] <toddmparker> I'd vote to keep it enhanced and note this
[15:54:24] <toddmparker> Close all bugs as can't fix
[15:56:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: When that inefectual click on the back button happens, the title changes too - just the page doesn't ...
[15:56:15] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: o.O
[15:56:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah ... insanity.
[15:56:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: M$'s contribution to global warming.
[15:57:21] <toddmparker>  What a crap browser
[15:58:10] <toddmparker> Wonder if we should keep a known issues list per browser 
[15:58:21] <toddmparker> To note stuff like this 
[15:58:26] <toddmparker> Wiki page?
[15:58:33] <gseguin> johnbender: are we still doing nightlies?
[15:58:44] <gseguin> or can I just ditch that
[15:58:45] <gseguin> ?
[16:00:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK. I'll close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5512 ...
[16:00:54] <toddmparker> We still have nightlies? Like date stamped JS and CSS?
[16:01:14] <toddmparker> Hitting a tunnel so gonna go
[16:01:15] <johnbender> gseguin: ditch
[16:01:30] <gseguin> johnbender: thanks
[16:05:08] <_|Nix|_> OK ... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5512 is history.
[16:12:59] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Where would a blurb about not using multipage documents in IE7 go?
