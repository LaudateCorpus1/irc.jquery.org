[01:50:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl force-pushed transitions-sequential-simultaneous from 23edd76 to 8c59b8f: http://git.io/4L2fiQ
[01:50:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/transitions-sequential-simultaneous] wrapped and refactored portions of the default transitionHandler function to allow for sequential or simultaneous transitions. The default sequential transition handler for 1.1 should not change at all. Both types are defined as different transition handlers ($.mobile.transitionHandlers.simultaneous and $.mobile.transitionHandlers.sequential), though their logic is shared internally 
[01:50:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/transitions-sequential-simultaneous] updated slide transition to use the simultaneous handler. - scottjehl
[01:50:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/transitions-sequential-simultaneous] changed default of minScrollBack to 250 - the value still claimed in the docs. This reverts @toddparker's change in commit a6dc847474cd43b10d85744c66bd1d9ccce1632a, as a higher number is needed when reintroducing simultaneous transitions - scottjehl

[07:02:05] <Wilto> Morning, guys.
[07:02:58] <Wilto> johnbender, gseguin: Eh, kinda. We had a PR come in that raises an exception when there isn’t a label associated with a check/radio, and I was wondering about doing so. We’re not explicitly flinging exceptions around anywhere else.
[08:12:55] <Wilto> Ah-hah, missed the BC thread.
[08:40:59] <tbenzige> hey toddparker
[10:17:57] <Wilto> Hey, anyone getting an error when they hit http://filamentgroup.com/examples/ajax-include/demo.html ?
[10:32:25] <gseguin> Wilto: as in JS error?
[10:32:51] <gseguin> no errors here
[10:52:23] <tbenzige> hey toddparker you aroudn?
[11:15:58] <Wilto> tbenzige: He’s mid-meeting. Whassup?
[11:17:00] <Wilto> Happy to take a message, fold it into a paper plane, and throw it at him.
[12:09:03] <toddparker> hey tbenzige
[12:09:05] <toddparker> here i am
[12:17:52] <Wilto> ♫ ROCK YOU LIKE A HUR-RI-CANE. ♫
[12:24:58] <toddparker> ba-na-na-NA ♫
[13:09:00] <gseguin> lol
[13:09:27] <gseguin> hey guys question regarding our textarea
[13:09:51] <gseguin> we do autogrow for them
[13:10:08] <gseguin> our routine to autogrow is pretty costly
[13:13:42] <gseguin> I've adapted: http://james.padolsey.com/demos/plugins/jQuery/autoresize.jquery.js
[13:27:23] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: kinblas thinks he saw a matrix of responsive image approaches on brad frost's website and I'm wondering if you guys might have a link
[13:28:02] <Wilto> You cannot be told what the Matrix is, johnbender.
[13:28:07] <johnbender> ah
[13:28:11] <kinblas> or at least I thought it was brad frost since I remember seeing a lot of orange
[13:28:12] <Wilto> One sec.
[13:28:16] <johnbender> should have seen that one coming
[13:28:26] <Wilto> I’m a predictable sorta nerd.
[13:28:52] <Wilto> Oh, oh, are these the CloudFour blogs?
[13:29:16] <johnbender> ?
[13:29:22] <Wilto> They’ve got a three-post series on responsive images, but… I mean, all front-end approaches are kind of doomed as it stands now.
[13:29:27] <Wilto> Hence my ongoing <picture> crusade.
[13:29:32] <kinblas> Wilto: nah it was more of a spreadsheet
[13:29:43] <kinblas> though the cloudfour stuff is easier to find
[13:30:09] <Wilto> Diggin’.
[13:31:33] <Wilto> Not finding anything, unfortunately.
[13:32:46] <Wilto> But it basically breaks down to a redundant request for the “enhanced” image using any front-end technique—JS, CSS, etc. Which is manageable. That’s what the Globe is doing now.
[13:32:59] <Wilto> Or something based on UAs, which… Y’know, uses UAs.
[13:33:07] <Wilto> (sniffing, I mean).
[13:36:27] <johnbender> Wilto: nice http://blog.cloudfour.com/responsive-imgs-part-2/
[13:36:30] <johnbender> that's a nice summary
[13:37:18] <Wilto> Scott’s <picture> polyfill is the only thing I know of that works 100% on the front-end.
[13:37:35] <Wilto> I mean, swapping <picture> and the <source>s for divs/spans/whatever.
[13:37:49] <Wilto> It’s a little gross, but—again—hence my crusade.
[13:49:23] <tbenzige> toddparker: sorry i missed you. i was at lunch. you still around?
[13:50:48] <toddparker> hi tyler
[13:56:25] <tbenzige> i need to revise the game plan that I sent you earlier
[13:56:53] <tbenzige> youre question about the inspector panel made me realize we do need completely separate versions of TR
[13:57:35] <tbenzige> the problem i was having was having an upgrade tool for all the versions
[13:58:16] <tbenzige> one idea was to have them all point to the server, but i didn't like that for the development environment.
[13:58:58] <tbenzige> so how about a separate repo for the upgrade tool and then separate branches for each version?
[14:24:19] <tbenzige> toddparker: thoughts??
[14:33:56] <Wilto> Guys. Is this awesome, or double-awesome? https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi
[14:36:05] <toddparker> hey tyler…sorry. back
[14:36:36] <toddparker> so having separate tools for each version is fine
[14:36:44] <toddparker> the upgrade tool is interesting
[14:37:05] <toddparker> it's really just import in general
[14:37:19] <toddparker> import needs to be able to load in any older version of a theme
[14:37:36] <toddparker> and get it into the UI for downlaoding
[14:38:02] <toddparker> now we could build this so we only support upgrading from the last version:
[14:38:17] <toddparker> if 1.23 is out and I only have a 1.0 theme
[14:38:33] <toddparker> i'd need to go to TR 1.1 and import the 1.0 theme > save
[14:38:42] <toddparker> then open 1.2 TR and import that
[14:39:01] <toddparker> seems clumsy tho so if we can make this easier for people w/o going crazy that would be good
[14:39:32] <toddparker> we're close enough to 1.1 that getting this built and tested within the next week is important, huh?
[14:44:17] <tbenzige> toddparker: yeah. ive been working on reworking TR altogether to make these additions easier
[14:44:46] <tbenzige> my thought on the upgrading/importing workflow is this:
[14:45:14] <tbenzige> if you think of the upgrade process as living in its own tool, a separate upgrade repo makes sense
[14:46:06] <tbenzige> and if each version of themeroller uses the same tool, this means that no matter what version I'm working with, i can open an import dialog paste in a theme and say upgrade this theme to whatever version i want and get redirected there

[15:13:42] <toddparker> sounds good tbenzige
[15:13:53] <toddparker> is this a huge change for you?
[15:16:25] <tbenzige> toddparker: no not really. it might need to be for the UI
[15:16:41] <tbenzige> do you have time soon to sit down and try to reorganize the design?
[15:17:34] <tbenzige> i was thinking we could switch to icon-style buttons for most of the tools: download ( down arrow ) import ( up arrow ) share ( diagonal or specialized arrow ) and help ( question mark )
[15:17:49] <tbenzige> also when i get to undo and redo, those could be curved or hooked arrows
[15:18:02] <tbenzige> something along those lines might look good and could save us space
[15:19:32] <tbenzige> also we need some kind of nav bar in case the user needs to go between versions willy-nilly
[15:21:14] <tbenzige> i like the top bar with the inspector toggle, quickswatch, and kuler too much to get rid of it. so i was just trying to think of how to fit in all the tools in the top left
[15:36:00] <tbenzige> toddparker: I'll be taking off for the day soon. Send me an email to let me know what you think we should do about the UI
