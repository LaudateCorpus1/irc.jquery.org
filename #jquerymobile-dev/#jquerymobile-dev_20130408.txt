[05:07:53] <_|Nix|_> Whoops :)
[05:07:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry!
[05:07:57] <_|Nix|_> :)
[05:08:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wanna figure out if there's a way to measure page load time using an iframe.
[05:08:34] <_|Nix|_> Alas! No such channel :(
[05:57:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping! I'm reading about window.performance.timing and localStorage, and I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to collect page load stats for the front page.
[05:58:08] <_|Nix|_> This should help us track down page load time regressions.
[05:59:54] <_|Nix|_> We could even add an easter egg or something that displays these stats nicely.
[06:06:28] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[06:08:41] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[06:08:51] <_|Nix|_> Whaddya think?
[06:09:27] <uGoMobi> good idea
[06:09:48] <uGoMobi> what was johnbender setting up with jsperf exactly?
[06:10:51] <uGoMobi> a more general perfomance comparison?
[06:12:31] <uGoMobi> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Navigation_timing looks interesting
[06:20:30] <toddmparker> morning
[06:21:11] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[06:25:18] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi 
[06:25:38] <toddmparker> conference wifi is not so good so if I drop, you know why
[06:26:10] <toddmparker> so I should get ready for the 1.3.1 release, huh?
[06:27:23] <frequent> morning
[06:27:48] <toddmparker> hey frequent 
[06:30:06] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, I think we can release when gseguin is here
[06:30:11] <frequent> uGoMobi: I got the css icon on the <input> tag :-)
[06:30:12] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[06:30:19] <toddmparker> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_, gseguin, johnbender - we all set for 1.3.1?
[06:30:21] <uGoMobi> frequent: nice
[06:30:33] <toddmparker> frequent: interesting. demo?
[06:30:39] <frequent> 1sec
[06:30:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Hey, Todd!
[06:31:03] <toddmparker> hey _|Nix|_ 
[06:31:18] <frequent> toddmparker: http://bit.ly/10uxi8Q
[06:31:42] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: If we're going to encourage using download builder, we should probably provide a way to not only remove unneeded bits of the library, but also a way to split the library into bits that are required for the front page and everything else.
[06:31:54] <frequent> still needs polish, but with CSS box-sizing it would work
[06:32:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Then, the required bits can be loaded synchronously, and the rest of the library asynchronously.
[06:33:15] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: I think that's a really good long-term goal.  
[06:33:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, devs still have the whole library, and they can decide which bits of it absolutely need to hog startup time, and which bits can wait (because they're not used on the front page).
[06:33:27] <toddmparker> Seems like that may end up being very complex, no?
[06:33:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm thinking it would be an extension of grunt build --modules=<list-of-modules>
[06:34:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... since we already have a way of specifying that only certain parts of the library should be included.
[06:34:25] <toddmparker> right, so we'd know whack plugins are needed and only wait for that code to execute
[06:34:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you mean front page as in first page?
[06:34:58] <toddmparker> so you see this as something a dev would config up front somehow?
[06:35:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, we wouldn't know, but devs could do something like <script src="jquery.mobile.sync.min.js"></script><script async src="jquery.mobile.async.min.js"></script>
[06:35:19] <toddmparker> on an average site, any page could be the front (first) page
[06:35:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah. It's another way to roll a custom build.
[06:35:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: right
[06:35:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, and those other pages would perform poorly.
[06:35:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... because they'd load the library as a whole.
[06:35:58] <toddmparker> this might make sense for an app that have a more focused flow but sites can be deep linked into
[06:36:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: You can still check the logs as to which page is accessed most often as a start page.
[06:36:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm sure it's not an even distribution.
[06:37:13] <toddmparker> it's an interesting idea for sure
[06:37:48] <toddmparker> I'd like to focus on improving the performance of our code across the board as the first step
[06:38:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: For sure. Let's not run any code on startup that we don't absolutely need to run.
[06:38:45] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15MattFriedman opened issue #5865: Navbar does not have a change event  02http://git.io/8IL_vg
[06:39:14] <toddmparker> i think we can gain more speed improvement by re-factoring widgets and the need for markup enhancement with less technical complexity compared to trying to finesse the execution
[06:39:35] <toddmparker> eventually, both are good just saying we have lower hanging fruit
[06:39:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Agreed.
[06:39:57] <toddmparker> speaking of which, did you see the doc arschmitz put together with our punch list of stuff to look at for widget re-factoring for 1.4?
[06:40:20] <toddmparker> be awesome to have you and arschmitz jam on cleaning up our plugins
[06:40:58] <toddmparker> uGoMobi, scottjehl, Wilto and I are going to huddle on Wed/Thu to really dig into the markup cleanup. That should dramatically reduce the need to JS in general
[06:41:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Can you URL me that punch list?
[06:42:38] <toddmparker> sure
[06:43:00] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit
[06:44:26] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Awesome!
[06:44:30] <toddmparker> I think tackling the form widgets might be a good place to start since those are commonly used 
[06:44:56] <toddmparker> the button, list view code will be heavily influenced by out makeup re-work so this should wait a bit
[06:45:19] <toddmparker> but if you and arschmitz want to tag team on this, that would be massively helpful
[06:49:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I get an error when I test local build
[06:50:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: maybe something johnbender has to look at before we cherry-pick the fix for the zip
[06:50:19] <gseguin> Good mornin'
[06:50:26] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[06:50:27] <gseguin> I heard the sound of a release 
[06:51:28] <gseguin> so I toddmparker: should I do `grunt release` on 1.3-stable?
[06:51:42] <uGoMobi> the error has to with demos/examples/backbone-require/index.php
[06:51:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin: no
[06:52:16] <gseguin> ah bummer!
[06:52:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: johnbender's fix for the zip file isn't in 1.3-stable yet
[06:52:47] <gseguin> oh that's right I just fetched and there was nothing for 1.3-stable
[06:53:09] <uGoMobi> was testing on master and got an error
[06:53:32] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: ah, right. i knew there was something...
[06:53:41] <toddmparker> so the docs changes aren't in?
[06:53:54] <gseguin> alright. I'll be lurking. Ping me when we're ready or if you need something from me
[06:53:55] <uGoMobi> not yet
[06:54:34] <toddmparker> ok, so is that the only blocker?
[06:54:57] <uGoMobi> gseguin: do you get an error too if you do grunt dist on master?
[06:55:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes
[06:55:18] <gseguin> uGoMobi: what error?
[06:55:46] <uGoMobi> error while processing demos/examples/backbone-require/index.php
[06:59:13] <gseguin> I'm having trouble switching branch again
[06:59:23] <gseguin> because of the gmap.js thing
[06:59:40] <gseguin> I'll try once I managed to rebase

[07:01:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK.
[07:01:07] <toddmparker> heh. delete and start over. that's my git strategy.
[07:01:43] <gseguin> there is something funky with that file
[07:01:47] <gseguin> we need to figure out what it is
[07:01:47] <gseguin> I think it's a CRLF problem
[07:02:04] <gseguin> frequent: what OS are you using?
[07:02:23] <uGoMobi> ohw... we have a security breach?

[07:06:43] <frequent> nope.
[07:06:56] <gseguin> yeah I think that's the issue
[07:06:58] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I remember we had an issue like that before
[07:07:03] <frequent> sorry
[07:07:11] <frequent> will do tonight

[07:07:18] <uGoMobi> in the grunt.js file
[07:07:19] <gseguin> I'm just trying to track down the issue

[09:17:46] <gseguin> johnbender: http://pastebin.com/heiRXzHa
[09:18:12] <gseguin> it actually gets prepended with "dist/" 
[09:18:16] <gseguin> is that expected?
[09:18:52] <johnbender> gseguin: it's a hack so that the relative resolution of the include file comes from dist
[09:18:57] <johnbender> and not from demos
[09:19:16] <johnbender> gseguin: the original problem was that we need to deal with files that are included that themselves have includes
[09:19:20] <johnbender> *firsT*
[09:19:31] <johnbender> so I just made a special case in the interim
[09:19:47] <johnbender> but once those files have been copied with substituions we need to use the copied files and not the originals
[09:20:14] <johnbender> so adding dist/ ensures that the relative resoultion of the includes comes from the copied versions when it's search or global-nav
[09:20:19] <johnbender> gseguin: it's just a temp hack
[09:20:38] <johnbender> gseguin: make sense?
[09:21:59] <gseguin> johnbender: makes sense
[09:22:38] <toddmparker> I'll take a hack if it does the trick

[09:32:01] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[09:32:02] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Git build #5037: FIXED in 1 min 15 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Git/5037/
[09:32:02] <doesallmagic> John Bender: correct extension on nested include copy
[09:34:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: gseguin: let me know if you run into another issue, I checked with clean dist this time :)
[09:35:14] <uGoMobi> johnbender: looks good so far
[09:35:48] <uGoMobi> just don't know about how we deal with the version anymore
[09:36:07] <uGoMobi> is it correct that I see 1.3.1pre as version in my local build?
[09:36:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yes, I believe the deploy does the tag/increment etc
[09:36:48] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[09:37:36] <johnbender> uGoMobi: double check with gseguin though
[09:37:43] <uGoMobi> will do
[09:38:50] <gseguin> uGoMobi: yes
[09:39:06] <gseguin> only the official release will have the version set to 1.3.1
[09:39:23] <gseguin> immediatly after we tag it will change to 1.3.2pre
[09:39:37] <uGoMobi> great
[09:39:54] <uGoMobi> I see an issue... all links to API docs are broken
[09:42:14] <uGoMobi> in the source code we link to API docs like "http://api.jquerymobile.com/button/" but something changes it to "http://api.jquerymobile.com/button/index.html"
[09:46:02] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#263 (master - a9a18b0 : John Bender): The build was broken.

[09:46:47] <gseguin> johnbender: can you take care of that?
[09:47:01] <johnbender> gseguin: looking now
[09:47:08] <gseguin> thanks
[09:47:28] <uGoMobi> just checked, it only happens in the build
[09:49:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi: which file are you seeing that in (faster debugging)
[09:49:37] <uGoMobi> johnbender: all files in demos/widgets/
[09:49:54] <uGoMobi> they have a link at the top of the content to API docs
[09:50:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: for example dist/jquery.mobile/demos/examples/redirect/index.html
[09:51:18] <uGoMobi> oops... wrong link ... sorry
[09:51:31] <uGoMobi> johnbender: dist/jquery.mobile/demos/widgets/buttons/index.html
[09:53:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I don't see any links to the /index.html in that file
[09:53:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: are you saying that the links don't go anywhere since it's static files?
[09:53:24] <johnbender> that is
[09:53:34] <johnbender> button/ should be transformed to be button/index.html?
[09:54:51] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah
[09:55:01] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ok, gimme a minute
[09:55:24] <johnbender> uGoMobi: why is it that we didn't deal with this before
[09:55:32] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I feel like this is new for some reason
[09:55:52] <uGoMobi> johnbender: me too... maybe something changed in the API docs
[09:56:21] <gseguin> remember this is the first grunt 0.4 release
[09:56:47] <gseguin> so it makes sense that there are some issues
[09:58:49] <johnbender> gseguin: yah for sure but for our static docs and bash scripts before I don't recall doing anything like this
[09:59:00] <johnbender> gseguin: but it would still have been a problem right?
[09:59:08] <johnbender> I mean it's easy enough to fix
[10:01:32] <uGoMobi> johnbender: there is one more other thing
[10:01:45] <uGoMobi> the exceptions
[10:02:12] <uGoMobi> the PHP redirect example shouldn't be converted to .html
[10:04:22] <uGoMobi> and the same for index.php in the _assets/js folder ... although that file hasn't much use anyway
[10:05:07] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#264 (1.3-stable - a268ee8 : John Bender): The build is still failing.

[10:07:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yar
[10:07:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: sorry, it's the index.php in the redirect sample?
[10:08:36] <johnbender> uGoMobi: might need gseguin's help on that one though
[10:08:43] <johnbender> I'm not sure how to exclude files from the copy operation
[10:08:45] <uGoMobi> johnbender: nah, I think redirect.php... lemme check
[10:09:01] <uGoMobi> johnbender: or if that's easier we could exclude the folder
[10:09:20] <uGoMobi> the whole demo doesn't work outside a server anyway
[10:10:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: if it's problematic we can leave it
[10:10:57] <uGoMobi> maybe I can add a message like we do for no AJAX
[10:11:19] <johnbender> uGoMobi: excluding the folder is the same
[10:15:05] <gseguin> johnbender: to exclude files from the copy, use the "!file" globbing pattern in the files.src property of your target
[10:15:08] <uGoMobi> johnbender: shall we leave it?
[10:15:27] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm glad someone knows globs better than I do :(
[10:15:40] <johnbender> gseguin: that was a two fold question
[10:15:59] <johnbender> how much of globbing does grunt know and how do I do that with globbing lol
[10:24:56] <johnbender> uGoMobi: does chrome autocorrect for this when viewing with the file protocol?
[10:25:19] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I've got it working but I get a reference to the index in the search results no matter the marku
[10:25:41] <uGoMobi> johnbender: let me test on other browsers
[10:25:49] <JasonDScott___> toddmparker:  Are you around?
[10:25:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: super weird
[10:26:05] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I might just be looking in the wrong place
[10:29:59] <uGoMobi> johnbender: same on all desktop browsers
[10:30:12] <uGoMobi> it is weird
[10:30:22] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that would explain why we've never done it before :)
[10:30:32] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[10:31:00] <johnbender> I wonder if that's part of the file:// protocol or some such
[10:31:03] <gseguin> what am I looking at?
[10:31:23] <johnbender> gseguin: it looks like the browsers handle appending an index.html for the file:// protocol
[10:31:42] <gseguin> oh, really?
[10:32:30] <johnbender> gseguin: double checking
[10:32:54] <johnbender> gseguin: that would explain why we never had to do it before
[10:43:40] <johnbender> uGoMobi: any thoughts?
[10:43:44] <uGoMobi> johnbender: not sure if it's related but I now see this error in the console...
[10:43:57] <uGoMobi> XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///E:/jqm/src/dist/jquery.mobile/demos/widgets/checkbox/. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. index.html:1
[10:44:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: the ajax error is there because that's how we check if there's a server
[10:44:14] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[10:49:24] <johnbender> uGoMobi: not sure what to do here given that it appears to work just fine
[10:49:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi: or am I missing something
[10:49:59] <uGoMobi> johnbender: appears to work just fine?
[10:50:09] <uGoMobi> johnbender: do the links work for you?
[10:50:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yes, everything works for me
[10:50:24] <uGoMobi> huh
[10:50:25] <johnbender> uGoMobi: where are they failing for you
[10:50:32] <johnbender> uGoMobi: maybe I'm just not looking in the right palce
[10:51:07] <uGoMobi> johnbender: when I extract the zip and browse the demos
[10:51:22] <uGoMobi> each file in the widgets section
[10:51:58] <uGoMobi> they all have a link to the API docs of the widget
[10:52:08] <uGoMobi> all those links are broken for me
[10:52:56] <johnbender> uGoMobi: lol this is the exact opposite of the problem I thought we were having
[10:53:00] <johnbender> one sec
[10:55:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it's the demos javascript
[10:55:14] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it's not the browser 
[10:55:35] <uGoMobi> johnbender: huh, what do we do?
[10:55:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it just appends index.html onto everything
[10:55:59] <uGoMobi> I mean, what script is that?
[10:56:01] <uGoMobi> hmm
[10:56:52] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I see it now
[10:57:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: fixing now

[11:03:07] <uGoMobi> johnbender: were you still looking at making an exception for that redirect example?
[11:03:17] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah ^
[11:03:40] <uGoMobi> johnbender: it's not a biggie if you ask me
[11:04:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah I'll give it a whirl
[11:04:04] <uGoMobi> if we can quick fix it with a message that it doesn't work I think that's ok
[11:05:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I've excluded the directory all together
[11:05:27] <johnbender> uGoMobi: what do we do about the links?

[11:07:37] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah
[11:07:41] <johnbender> uGoMobi: should we just leave it

[12:09:44] <johnbender> gseguin: is the whole file like that?
[12:09:49] <johnbender> gseguin: or is it just sections?

[12:14:00] <gseguin> johnbender: the copyright is good
[12:14:06] <gseguin> I wonder if it's requirejs
[12:18:04] <johnbender> gseguin: why would it be require?
[12:18:28] <gseguin> because the copyright banner is not added by requirejs
[12:20:14] <gseguin> johnbender: I just tried with latest version of requirejs and no luck
[12:20:23] <gseguin> johnbender: so it's probably not that
[12:24:54] <johnbender> gseguin: stepping out for a quick run, I'll be back in 30
[12:25:14] <gseguin> johnbender: 
[12:25:14] <toddmparker> gseguin: what's the good word?
[12:25:15] <gseguin> ok
[12:25:41] <gseguin> toddmparker: what's on the CDN has ^M as eol
[12:25:47] <gseguin> that's no good
[12:25:55] <gseguin> the code works though
[12:26:53] <toddmparker> just one file or throughout?
[12:27:51] <gseguin> toddmparker: throughout
[12:27:59] <gseguin> it happens in my workspace too
[12:28:04] <toddmparker> what the...
[12:28:18] <gseguin> let me try something
[12:28:31] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: did you push up that branch for the button stuff?
[12:29:22] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no, not yet
[12:29:36] <uGoMobi> just have been hacking a bit in local files
[12:29:48] <toddmparker> ok, just checking

[12:31:43] <gseguin> when I build on my Linux box I don't have the ^M
[12:32:19] <toddmparker> odd
[12:33:34] <gseguin> hmm... but of course I can't deploy from my linux box

[13:17:38] <gseguin> johnbender: did you catch up?
[13:17:46] <johnbender> gseguin: negative
[13:17:56] <gseguin> so it's my mac
[13:18:01] <johnbender> gseguin: o.O
[13:18:08] <gseguin> I don't know what's fucked in my env
[13:18:14] <gseguin> I need to investigate
[13:18:26] <johnbender> gseguin: did we just manually alter the version number?
[13:18:28] <gseguin> in the meantime I redeployed from my Linux box
[13:18:40] <johnbender> gseguin: YESSSSS
[13:18:44] <gseguin> no that's cool it's just what's on the CDN
[13:18:44] <johnbender> LET IT BE KNOWN
[13:19:01] <gseguin> the codebase is good
[13:19:15] <gseguin> and the tag ( after I force pushed ) is good too
[13:19:16] <johnbender> gseguin: what about the version number displayed on the view site
[13:19:26] <gseguin> that is something else
[13:19:51] <gseguin> I just need to go on the view site and symlink
[13:19:52] <johnbender> gseguin: well the view site just uses the checked out tree
[13:20:00] <gseguin> because it's picking up the dev version
[13:20:02] <johnbender> gseguin: symlink to the cdn version?
[13:20:14] * gseguin checks
[13:20:25] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm under the impression they live on the same server or some such
[13:20:38] <johnbender> gseguin: I just altered the file directly
[13:20:42] <johnbender> (ghetto
[13:20:44] <johnbender> )
[13:20:50] <johnbender> until we figure out something more permanent
[13:21:07] <johnbender> there doesn't seem to be an easy out
[13:21:09] <gseguin> they do :D
[13:26:05] <gseguin> johnbender: fixed
[13:26:20] <gseguin> johnbender: I redirect the index.php to dist/
[13:26:25] <gseguin> it's gross
[13:26:28] <gseguin> but oh well
[13:26:41] <gseguin> we should have a proxy rule to do that

[13:33:09] <uGoMobi> do we need duct tape or are we ok?
[13:33:31] <gseguin> if that wasn't duct tape I wonder what that was ;)
[13:33:37] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:34:07] <gseguin> are we good then?
[13:34:45] <gseguin> uGoMobi: can you do use your test magic on view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1 ?
[13:35:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ending up here http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/
[13:35:40] <gseguin> yep that's the redirect I was talking about
[13:35:56] <uGoMobi> we do have a version! :)
[13:36:10] <uGoMobi> what happened to our favicon?
[13:36:21] <gseguin> oh gross
[13:36:24] <gseguin> I don't know
[13:38:42] <gseguin> uGoMobi: it's in the "wrong" place
[13:39:18] <uGoMobi> gseguin: the path is wrong?
[13:39:19] <gseguin> uGoMobi: gseguin@jq03:/var/www/view.jquerymobile.com/public_html/1.3.1/dist$ grep favicon index.html <link rel="shortcut icon" href="demos/_assets/favicon.ico">
[13:39:22] <gseguin> gseguin@jq03:/var/www/view.jquerymobile.com/public_html/1.3.1/dist$ ls demos/favicon.ico
[13:39:25] <gseguin> demos/favicon.ico
[13:39:45] <gseguin> I can change that on view but it needs to be addressed in the code
[13:40:24] <gseguin> oh wait
[13:40:28] <gseguin> no it's there
[13:40:43] <gseguin> it's just messed up
[13:40:49] <gseguin> oh I know 
[13:41:09] <gseguin> grunt has processed it as text
[13:41:15] <uGoMobi> aha
[13:41:30] <gseguin> I'll copy it from 1.3.0
[13:41:38] <uGoMobi> cool
[13:41:41] <gseguin> and will fix the filters in Gruntfile.js
[13:43:48] <gseguin> ?BOOM

[13:50:31] <gseguin> I'll take care of the builder on Wed
[13:54:15] <uGoMobi> unbelievable... I see the widgets list in the panel nav menu in my local build but not on view

[13:55:48] <uGoMobi> all fine there
[13:55:59] <gseguin> so what are you not seeing?
[13:56:09] <uGoMobi> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/widgets/accordions/
[13:56:14] <uGoMobi> open the nav panel
[13:56:32] <gseguin> the widget reference?
[13:56:37] <uGoMobi> there should be a list below "widget reference"
[13:56:42] <gseguin> darn
[13:56:58] <uGoMobi> and when you type in the search input you should get to see autocomplete list
[13:57:32] <uGoMobi> that's what johnbender fixed
