[00:20:11] <_|Nix|_> Hi, all! Before filing this as an issue, can someone please have a look to see whether I'm making some obvious mistake? I can't seem to enable a selectmenu: http://jsfiddle.net/hLVZd/34/
[00:27:46] <_|Nix|_> OK, NM ... looks like it doesn't listen to "option", "disabled", true/false, but only to "enable"/"disable" ...
[00:28:22] <_|Nix|_> This is really inconsistent. $.mobile.widget introduces the "disabled" option, but this widget doesn't really support it.
[07:38:02] <Wilto> ’Morning, guys.
[08:00:15] <johnbender> Wilto_: where's that todd guy?
[08:00:53] <Wilto> Man, who knows. That slacker.
[08:01:23] <Wilto> He is actually cleaning up my elephant graveyard of a desk, which was littered with dead devices.
[08:46:16] <jzaefferer> Wilto: seen this? http://24ways.org/2011/adaptive-images-for-responsive-designs-again
[08:48:41] <Wilto> jzaefferer: Je-sus.
[08:48:49] <Wilto> <script>document.write('<' + '!--')</script><noscript><img src="image.jpg"></noscript -->
[08:49:00] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/mindblown.gif
[08:50:14] <Wilto> If that doesn’t prove that we’re clutching at straws on this, nothin’ does.
[09:01:39] <jzaefferer> Wilto: yeah, its not pretty; if you're talking to standards people, maybe clutch on to Bruce Lawson and his proposal: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/18/html5-semantics/#highlighter_773359
[09:02:34] <Wilto> Yeah, we’ve been talking that through.
[09:02:53] <Wilto> https://etherpad.mozilla.org/responsive-assets, if you’re curious.
[09:03:23] <Wilto> We got a bunch of sharp people and also me together to do some brainstorming, and we reached the <picture> conclusion without knowing it had already been pitched in, like, 2007.
[09:05:13] <jzaefferer> oh, okay
[09:05:18] <jzaefferer> so that didn't get anywhere?
[09:05:38] <Wilto> Oh, it will.
[09:05:53] <Wilto> In 2007 everyone was like “oh cool idea,” and then it just died out.
[09:06:41] <jzaefferer> well, guess the context is now quite different
[09:07:08] <jzaefferer> lemme know when I should click "+1" somewhere :-)
[09:07:41] <Wilto> Very much so. And the main argument against is “IN THE FUTURE, ALL DEVICES WILL BE 1200DPI AND ALL PHONE WILL HAVE 1TBPS CONNECTIONS.”
[09:08:13] * johnbender looks forward to that Neuromancer inspired future
[09:08:14] <jzaefferer> orly?
[09:08:15] <Wilto> Which 1) c’mon, man. and 2) if these sources hinge on media queries, this technique will be completely flexible if that’s ever the case.
[09:08:43] <Wilto> I have exaggerated somewhat, but the main idea is that all screens will be high resolution and mobile bandwidth won’t be a concern.
[09:09:09] <Wilto> Which, sure, maybe. Or say we can detect bandwidth—awesome. We can probably bet that’ll be in a MQ.
[09:09:21] <Wilto> In which case, the <picture> model will continue to be awesome.
[09:10:26] <Wilto> ( I figure it’s probably fine for you guys to read the advance copy of this: https://etherpad.mozilla.org/resp-ala )
[09:10:47] <Wilto> ( Y’know, if you’re curious about why I’ve been so quiet/crazy for the past week. )
[09:17:15] <jzaefferer> I hope that's not your only copy
[09:17:24] <jzaefferer> I've lost way too much work over Etherpad...
[09:44:35] <Wilto> Oh, God no. I love Etherpad, but nothing should live there.
[10:17:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] jblas pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/zVP6nQ
[10:17:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Initial checkin of config-props.html, a utility for quickly assessing the support property settings, for a given device/browser, as calculated by jQuery Core and jQuery Mobile. - jblas@adobe.com
[10:52:16] <toddmparker_> hey all
[10:52:23] <toddmparker_> irc cloud was dead all day
[10:53:21] <sven_franck> hey
[10:54:10] <toddmparker_> hey
[10:54:42] <toddmparker_> kinblas, johnbender, gseguin - any of you dialing into the rim chat?
[10:54:43] <sven_franck> should we go ahead with the plugin-tour on Thursday?
[10:54:47] <kinblas> yeah
[10:55:04] <toddmparker_> cool, thanks kinblas
[10:55:11] <sven_franck> then I will prepare a small "tour guide" to mail in advance
[10:55:19] <toddmparker_> thanks sven_franck
[10:55:27] <toddmparker_> we can coordinate on a time
[10:55:50] <toddmparker_> kinblas: any topics?
[10:56:30] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I can dial in
[10:56:45] <gseguin> not that I have much to say though
[10:56:47] <Wilto> I’m listening from afar, if anyone needs me.
[10:57:05] <toddmparker_> ok, yeah this can be quick
[10:57:10] <toddmparker_> i hope
[11:02:10] <toddmparker_> dialed in. inspirational music
[11:03:05] <Wilto> That’s my jam, right thurr.
[11:03:31] <gseguin> totally digg that tune!
[11:06:21] <toddmparker_> yeah, love it
[11:06:29] <gseguin> toddmparker_: any message from Laurent?
[11:06:31] <toddmparker_> just realized that this invite was mine so maybe this isn't happening today
[11:06:48] <toddmparker_> just wrote laurent
[11:07:30] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: my internet here is spotty
[11:07:43] <johnbender> it's raining in LA so of course the power goes on and off
[11:07:45] <johnbender> :/
[11:07:50] <kinblas> heh 80s muzak
[11:08:11] <toddmparker_> just hung up
[11:08:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3121
[11:08:33] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3121 on jquery-mobile, reported by mtemanson (3w, 1d ago): Count bubble for multi-select inside a list view is incorrectly positioned
[11:08:48] * kinblas hangs up
[11:08:56] <johnbender> I proposed an interim solution until we actually split up the css for the builder
[11:10:05] <johnbender> also I'm in the process of reviewing commits made since the 1.0 release
[11:10:17] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/1.0-stable
[11:10:25] <johnbender> what's the commit up top there?
[11:10:37] * gseguin looks
[11:11:06] <gseguin> pulled in a PR that was optimizing PNGs
[11:11:25] <gseguin> I believe I had asked whether to backport it to 1.0-stable
[11:11:27] <johnbender> gseguin: kk did that make it on to master too?
[11:11:37] <gseguin> must have
[11:11:41] <gseguin> let me double check
[11:12:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: same question for the "Tweaks to custom select menu pages"
[11:12:23] <johnbender> that's not in the tagged releas
[11:12:27] <johnbender> *tag
[11:12:39] <johnbender> hmm
[11:12:40] <johnbender> docs
[11:14:37] <gseguin> johnbender: it did: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/master?page=4
[11:15:11] <gseguin> look for 5460ae3a4f
[11:15:24] <toddmparker_> johnbender: those tweaks should be pulled over if possible for the 1.0.1 release
[11:15:28] <toddmparker_> think they are in master now
[11:15:33] <toddmparker_> master only
[11:16:10] <toddmparker_> out of office reply from Laurent: I am on vacations, coming back on Jan 5th
[11:16:31] <Wilto> All the vacations.
[11:16:34] <gseguin> heh
[11:18:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: they're in the 1.0-stable branch so that means they'll be there
[11:19:08] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[11:19:19] <toddmparker_> no vacations for you guys
[11:19:20] <johnbender> alright, so I know that the stable branch is in a good spot, just need to make sure everything on master since then is ok
[11:19:24] <johnbender> and I can merge it in
[11:19:45] <toddmparker_> thank you so much for squaring this away johnbender
[11:19:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: easy stuff, and I'm happy to do it
[11:20:09] <johnbender> having everything well managed will serve the project
[11:20:09] <gseguin> wait what are you merging where?
[11:20:28] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm going to check that everything we've commited to master since 1.0 is a bug fix
[11:20:37] <gseguin> I thought what we have today matched exactly what you described
[11:20:50] <johnbender> gseguin: on master?
[11:21:02] <toddmparker_> master has been 1.1
[11:21:07] <gseguin> nope master is the dev branch
[11:21:15] <gseguin> sorry maybe I'm confused
[11:21:23] <toddmparker_> dev as in 1.0.1
[11:21:27] <gseguin> should I go back to reading that thread ?
[11:21:30] <toddmparker_> heh
[11:21:38] <toddmparker_> https://filamentgroup.basecamphq.com/projects/8580955-jquery-mobile-team/posts/55354540/comments#149914813
[11:21:38] <gseguin> dev as in 1.next
[11:21:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: up until now it's been 1.0.1
[11:21:47] <johnbender> not master is going to be 1.1
[11:21:52] <johnbender> *now master is going to be 1.1
[11:21:53] <toddmparker_> yeah, that's kinda what I said gseguin
[11:22:10] <gseguin> master has always been 1.1 after the branching
[11:22:15] <gseguin> at least to me
[11:22:25] <gseguin> was I the only one knowing it?
[11:22:30] <johnbender> gseguin: well yes, it has but we can't do patch releases from it *beacuse* it's 1.1
[11:22:32] <toddmparker_> i thought we had added some commits to master that would be for 1.1, like adding staeps and the fill to sliders
[11:23:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: good example
[11:23:20] <johnbender> gseguin: does that make it clear?
[11:23:28] <gseguin> no
[11:23:32] <johnbender> gseguin: you're not wrong
[11:23:33] <gseguin> sorry
[11:23:47] <johnbender> we're just going to use 1.0-stable to build patch releases from
[11:23:54] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #336: SUCCESS in 12 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/336/
[11:23:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jblas: Initial checkin of config-props.html, a utility for quickly assessing the support property settings, for a given device/browser, as calculated by jQuery Core and jQuery Mobile.
[11:24:01] <johnbender> gseguin: we can't do that from master
[11:24:02] <gseguin> ok, as originally planned
[11:24:11] <toddmparker_> right, but we've had the 1.0-stable branch since 1.0 shipped right?
[11:24:19] <toddmparker_> and we were using master as 1.next
[11:24:25] <gseguin> correct
[11:24:26] <johnbender> gseguin: when we talked we were following the core folks
[11:24:31] <toddmparker_> so there aren't really any big changes here
[11:24:38] <johnbender> and the core folks don't use the stable branch at all
[11:24:46] <johnbender> *everything* just goes on master
[11:24:52] <toddmparker_> except johnbender needs to pick the commits over to 1.0-stable, right?
[11:25:10] <gseguin> they don't provide patch versions do they?
[11:25:15] <johnbender> gseguin: the 1.0-stable for core is effectively a tag
[11:25:29] <johnbender> when I asked them about it they confirmed that
[11:25:37] <toddmparker_> so everything goes on master, and they manually cherry pick commits into a branch to release a maintenance release?
[11:25:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: no they just do releases from master from what they told me
[11:25:59] <johnbender> I'm not sure how they handle major features
[11:26:03] <johnbender> tbh
[11:26:07] <johnbender> branches or what
[11:26:09] <toddmparker_> yeah, that's my Q
[11:26:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: he said everything just goes on Master
[11:26:21] <toddmparker_> how to exclude commits related to the next release
[11:26:39] <toddmparker_> and how to test that subset for the maintenance release
[11:26:50] <johnbender> he being Dave Methvin or Richard Worth (I can't remember which)
[11:26:57] <johnbender> so
[11:27:09] <johnbender> we're going to do what gseguin thought we were doing in the first place
[11:27:18] <johnbender> bug fixes to 1.0-stable
[11:27:25] <johnbender> new features to master
[11:27:42] <johnbender> gseguin: so just keep doing what you thought we were doing
[11:27:53] <gseguin> k
[11:28:03] <johnbender> gseguin: but I have to move bug fix commits over to master because I was following the core folks
[11:28:28] <gseguin> to 1.0-stable you mean ?
[11:28:30] <johnbender> semi carelessly in the case of things like the step pull request
[11:30:22] <johnbender> gseguin: yes sorry
[11:30:43] <gseguin> you almost got me confused again ;)
[11:30:43] <johnbender> I need to move bug fix commits over to 1.0-stable because I was following the core folks
[11:32:08] <johnbender> yes the issue is confusing as it is without interchanging the names at inopportune times
[11:34:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sorry to pester you did you have a chance to think/view my comment on the css fix?
[11:34:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3121
[11:34:56] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3121 on jquery-mobile, reported by mtemanson (3w, 1d ago): Count bubble for multi-select inside a list view is incorrectly positioned
[11:35:00] <toddmparker_> for the bubbles
[11:35:04] <johnbender> yah
[11:35:10] <toddmparker_> looking...
[11:35:14] <johnbender> can we just dumpt that in the select css with a comment
[11:35:22] <johnbender> "that" being the pr css
[11:36:03] <toddmparker_> yeah, i think that's the wayt o go
[11:36:14] <johnbender> cool
[11:36:37] <johnbender> I'll pull that into master after I get done seperating things out and then move it to the select css
[11:36:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: thanks
[11:36:42] <toddmparker_> it should be in the widget (select) styles, not lists for sure
[11:37:10] <toddmparker_> each widget should take care of working in various contexts (widgets), not the other way around
[11:41:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: I'm going to list the commits that should *not* be pulled into 1.0-stable from master in the basecamp thread for reference and review
[11:41:40] <johnbender> I'm assuming it's the smaller set
[11:41:47] <toddmparker_> sounds good
[11:41:54] <gseguin> sounds good
[11:41:58] <toddmparker_> you could also use a wiki page if you prefer
[11:42:15] <toddmparker_> how exactly do we do a release this way?
[11:42:42] <toddmparker_> too bad you can't have a branch that is really just a pointer to master, minus some commits
[11:43:18] <toddmparker_> be nice to have a url that represents 1.0.1 in addition to /test/ (master) so we can keep an eye on how it's shaping up
[11:43:53] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gco 1.0-stable; #bump version; make deploy
[11:44:19] <toddmparker_> looks easy enough
[11:44:22] <toddmparker_> how about testing?
[11:44:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I need to duplicate our build process for the current stable branch
[11:48:19] <toddmparker_> so we can push up a live preview
[11:48:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we should be able to
[11:48:35] <toddmparker_> great
[11:48:44] <johnbender> just need to make another sub directory for the website and alter the post commit hook
[14:25:29] <toddmparker_> garann - you around?
[14:26:21] <toddmparker_> johnbender: is this a bug or a feature request: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3253
[14:26:22] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3253 on jquery-mobile, reported by acemrek (1h, 33m ago): allowSamePageTransition
[14:28:03] <garann> yeah toddmparker_
[14:28:12] <toddmparker_> hey garann!
[14:28:18] <garann> hi :D
[14:28:49] <toddmparker_> i'm just triaging issues and wanted to see if there were specific type sof things you're interested in helping out with
[14:28:49] <garann> toddmparker_: actually trying to change this header/footer code
[14:29:19] <garann> toddmparker_: i'm happy to help with anything, but only having an iphone limits what i can test
[14:29:25] <toddmparker_> btw - sorry that I had Scott take up the fixed toolbar stuff, but after talking to him, I realized how much history/messiness was only in his head
[14:29:28] <garann> interaction stuff is fun
[14:29:40] <garann> toddmparker_: oh, i didn't know that
[14:29:42] <toddmparker_> ok, so iOS and logic stuff that should pop up on any browser
[14:29:48] <garann> i will stop messing with it, then :)
[14:29:53] <toddmparker_> oh, sorry
[14:30:00] <toddmparker_> irc is a bad medium
[14:30:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: commented
[14:30:20] <toddmparker_> do you have changes over what is checked in? he was working with your code
[14:30:36] <garann> no, toddmparker_, nothing but debugging type stuff
[14:30:47] <garann> trying to figure out what was being used and what could be taken out
[14:30:52] <garann> no real progress
[14:31:01] <toddmparker_> yeah, i finally got scott on chat and i was going over things and there is a lot of interconnected stuff between that and other plugins, plus some crazy stuff that you'd only know if you were him
[14:31:16] <garann> cool
[14:31:36] <toddmparker_> so i said i'd talk to you about switching gears because he had time to take what you started and add feature tests and such
[14:31:58] <toddmparker_> what you did so far proved this works and will be slick so it's a great start
[14:32:05] <toddmparker_> so thanks
[14:32:07] <garann> awesome!
[14:32:21] <toddmparker_> so i'll tag a few issues to you if you don't mind
[14:32:31] <toddmparker_> we need to start working down that list of 400 issues
[14:32:31] <garann> sounds good
[14:32:32] <toddmparker_> yikes
[14:32:43] <garann> whoa o_O
[14:35:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/9jVnZg
[14:35:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixed non reacting generated back buttons with touchOverflowEnabled - Nicolas Bartoli
[14:35:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3251 from JFK99/master - Todd Parker
[14:38:14] <toddmparker_> yeah. lots of edge cases and little odd things
[14:38:19] <toddmparker_> you can really help on that stuff
[14:38:40] <toddmparker_> satifying to pick off these things
[14:38:41] <garann> toddmparker_: that sounds perfect
[14:38:45] <toddmparker_> cool
[14:38:51] <toddmparker_> taggin as we speak
[14:38:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: kinblas: I've update the branching thread with a list of commits that I need an opinion on
[14:39:05] <garann> i'm going to be pretty distracted this week, but after friday i'll have a lot more time
[14:39:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: whats the scheme with the z-indices
[14:40:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ie how would one know to set that to 10 rather than 9
[14:40:31] <toddmparker_> heh, escalation
[14:40:51] <toddmparker_> we need to go through and have a more rational z-index scheme
[14:41:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: `grep -R "z-index" css/`
[14:41:35] <johnbender> lookes like we're in good shape at least
[14:41:38] <johnbender> nothing over 10
[14:41:53] <johnbender> toddmparker_: lied
[14:41:56] <toddmparker_> really? i thought we had some big numbers somewhere
[14:41:59] <toddmparker_> ya
[14:42:00] <johnbender> headerfooter has 1000 lol
[14:42:14] <johnbender> core has 200
[14:42:20] <johnbender> and 100
[14:42:27] <johnbender> nice and round at least :P
[14:42:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I was just curious how smart folks like yourself solve that problem
[14:42:44] <toddmparker_> it requires you sit down and figure out how each z-index thing could be used in combo to see what the layering should be
[14:42:48] <toddmparker_> ya
[14:42:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it would be cool to have "strata"
[14:43:00] <toddmparker_> leaving room for 201, 202, etc.
[14:43:05] <toddmparker_> like writing basic
[14:43:14] <johnbender> and write guidelines for what goes in each of them
[14:43:16] <toddmparker_> 10 print "Bender sux"
[14:43:19] <toddmparker_> 20 GOTO 10
[14:43:23] <johnbender> :D
[14:43:33] <toddmparker_> yeah
[14:43:35] <toddmparker_> fun.
[14:43:42] <johnbender> hah
[14:49:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you think that flip toggle switch title issue was a bug?https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2759
[14:49:07] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2759 on jquery-mobile, reported by staabm (1m, 3w ago): title of flip toggle switches between 1/0 instead yes/no
[14:49:10] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2759
[14:49:10] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2759 on jquery-mobile, reported by staabm (1m, 3w ago): title of flip toggle switches between 1/0 instead yes/no
[14:50:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: if so then the only thing thats a candidate for skipping is the step support
[14:50:39] <johnbender> at which point we might just want to merge it in anyway and make a note about it for the patch release
[14:50:51] <toddmparker_> and that one to fill the slider track with a color
[14:50:54] <johnbender> since cherry picking the other commits is going to be ... interesting
[14:51:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we didn't merge that one
[14:51:05] <toddmparker_> but yeah, that's fine
[14:51:07] <toddmparker_> oh, ok
[14:51:16] * johnbender goes to double check
[14:51:28] <toddmparker_> how many commits roughly are lined up for maintenance
[14:51:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2381
[14:51:32] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by hpbuniat (3m, 1w ago): Slider: Support for a range-theme
[14:51:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: 126
[14:51:41] <toddmparker_> wowie
[14:51:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: one sec
[14:51:54] <toddmparker_> wonder if we should push our 1.0.1 soonish
[14:51:58] <toddmparker_> next 2 weeks
[14:52:07] <toddmparker_> or start of the year
[14:52:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: git log 1.0.. | grep "Author" | wc -l
[14:52:50] <toddmparker_> johnbender: that slider was a bug...or an oversight
[14:52:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: might want to wait until people are around to deal with issues
[14:53:04] <toddmparker_> should be fixed, bad for accessibility
[14:53:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the title?
[14:53:35] <toddmparker_> ya for the switch
[14:53:46] <johnbender> I'll add an update to the thread to get everyone's approval on just merging the step suppor in
[14:54:00] <toddmparker_> ok, sure that's fine
[14:57:19] <toddmparker_> johnbender: is this something important to tag for 1.1? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3227
[14:57:19] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3227 on jquery-mobile, reported by jkane001 (6d, 7h ago): Dialog is added over itself on unobtrusive validation
[14:58:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that's a toughy but I think so
[14:58:28] <toddmparker_> tag for 1.1
[14:58:50] <toddmparker_> we can always bounce it later
[14:58:56] <toddmparker_> keeps it on the radar
[14:59:07] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the problem is we should really emulate the browser here but then we have to come up with some scheme for providing a unique url or otherwise differentiating
[14:59:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: anyway
[14:59:18] <johnbender> we'll figure it out
[14:59:40] <toddmparker_> kk
[14:59:43] <toddmparker_> tagged
[15:00:47] <toddmparker_> johnbender: opinion on this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3212
[15:00:48] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3212 on jquery-mobile, reported by pehrlich (1w, 2d ago): Feature request - handle text/json response
[15:02:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I saw that, I have to take a look at loadpage but it seems reasonable if it's a binary relationship
[15:02:49] <johnbender> ie, html or everything else
[15:03:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the only other issue is I'd have to looks at how much value this provides over our current event bindings
[15:04:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll ask him to take a look at the current hooks to see if he's tried it that way
[15:05:21] <toddmparker_> ok, thanks
[15:09:30] <toddmparker_> johnbender: need your eyes on this, lot of conversation
[15:09:30] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3190
[15:09:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3190 on jquery-mobile, reported by chris-steele (1w, 6d ago): Redirecting on first load, using changePage, does not work in WebKit browsers
[15:10:04] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kk, I'll take a look after I respond to json issue
[15:10:24] <toddmparker_> thanks, sorry for the barrage
[15:10:48] <johnbender> np np
[15:11:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm your dev life raft right now with Scott and Kin going in and out of focus
[15:11:30] <toddmparker_> seriously
[15:11:46] <toddmparker_> garann has thankfully volunteered to help fix bugs too
[15:11:47] * kinblas feels bad
[15:12:07] <toddmparker_> hey, adobe pays you kinblas
[15:12:19] <toddmparker_> they need to come first sometimes i suppose
[15:12:25] <kinblas> heh yeah
[15:12:26] <toddmparker_> is there an endpoint in sight
[15:12:36] <kinblas> it's close, my bug list is shrinking
[15:13:47] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I sent a basecamp note about that util page I checked in this morning
[15:14:21] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I want to turn it into a debug tool that folks can inject so we can figure out what their setup is when they run into problems
[15:14:23] <kinblas> this was just step 1
[15:14:28] <toddmparker_> cool
[15:14:41] <kinblas> there are other things we need to show like, document base, etc
[15:15:17] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it's also a quick way to see what our support calculations are for a given device
[15:15:52] <toddmparker_> nice. that is avery helpful
[15:16:02] <toddmparker_> we just need it to be on a nice url
[15:16:10] <toddmparker_> jqm.com/diagnostics

[15:21:16] <kinblas> toddmparker: I can respond, but I'm not sure this is a bug versus a question on how things work?
