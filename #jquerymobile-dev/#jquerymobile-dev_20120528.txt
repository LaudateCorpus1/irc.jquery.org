[12:04:16] <agcolom> good evening from London UK... I think today is a bank holiday in the USA and most of Europe... hence a really quiet IRC...
[12:05:47] <agcolom> Unfortunately the UK always do things differently... so normal day today... (i.e. work )
[12:07:17] <JasonDScott> agcolom: Normal day here too
[12:08:44] <agcolom> Hi Jason :-) it's not fair, is it?
[12:12:54] <JasonDScott> well... we did has last Monday off... :) so it's not _that_ bad

[12:14:08] <agcolom> and next weekend we have 4 days :-)
[12:14:24] <agcolom> (Queen Diamond Jubilee)
[12:14:50] <JasonDScott> I think we should get that one too, being a common wealth country
[12:15:06] <JasonDScott> :(
[12:16:05] <agcolom> Are you not getting it?
[12:16:31] <JasonDScott> No we are not

[13:16:03] <uGoMobi> creating a PR on my forked repo and then merging that PR myself and then picking it into 1.1-stable (after solving conflict) became too much for me ;-)

[14:07:30] <agcolom> uGoMobi Hi, if you're still around...
[14:07:42] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[14:08:17] <agcolom> So git is not being nice to you this evening?
[14:08:25] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:08:33] <uGoMobi> cant blame git
[14:09:05] <uGoMobi> my forked repo, master, 1.1-stable ... it was just a bit confusing
[14:10:01] <uGoMobi> i thought i merged something twice, so i wanted to revert before someone else pushed something to master
[14:10:34] <uGoMobi> after that i saw that the first commit was from my own forked repo :)
[14:10:35] <agcolom> I had a panic yesterday... I pushed to master but nothing was showing on IRC and when I was fetching from master, the changes weren't there!
[14:10:59] <uGoMobi> yeah i saw it on the irc log
[14:11:12] <agcolom> yes that was exactly my problem as well yesterday! I had pushed to my forked repo!
[14:11:19] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:11:46] <agcolom> I was glad nothing was broken! It can be very stressful!
[14:12:12] <uGoMobi> yeah i have to say... having both cloned and forked repo on local machine is something i am not used to yet either
[14:12:49] <agcolom> Also I am not at all a git expert! so it's probably a good way to learn, but the learning curve is steep!
[14:13:13] <agcolom> was it a bank holiday for you today? (normal work day here :-( )
[14:13:17] <uGoMobi> hehe you are doing great
[14:13:30] <uGoMobi> yeah holiday here
[14:13:41] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[14:14:08] <uGoMobi> good news about git is... everything can be undone
[14:14:12] <agcolom> lucky you! had quite a busy day so really tired tonight!
[14:14:16] <uGoMobi> even twice as i demonstrated :)
[14:14:26] <uGoMobi> aii
[14:14:40] <uGoMobi> well actually i was working too
[14:14:59] <uGoMobi> but couldnt get much done with the nice weather and all
[14:15:21] <agcolom> git: yes, true, provided you know what you're going :-)
[14:15:39] <agcolom> Do you have your own company?
[14:15:51] <uGoMobi> i am self employed
[14:16:08] <uGoMobi> so yes, but no employees
[14:16:28] <agcolom> Is it good? (been tempting but at the same time I like the safety of being employed...)
[14:16:54] <uGoMobi> well ups and downs
[14:17:33] <uGoMobi> but thats also because i wasnt always sure what direction i wanted to go
[14:18:15] <agcolom> Do you do mainly Web stuff or also native mobile apps?
[14:18:31] <uGoMobi> web stuff
[14:18:49] <uGoMobi> mostly the boring stuff to be honest
[14:19:17] <uGoMobi> and always had all kind of ideas what i wanted to with the cool mobile stuff
[14:19:22] <agcolom> ah, shame... what is it you call boring though?
[14:19:56] <uGoMobi> but somehow time passed by and i mostly did stuff that pays the bills but the ideas remain just ideas
[14:20:02] <agcolom> yes, I'm sure the mobile web is the way to go... everyone wants a mobile site (but they may not know that yet;-) )
[14:20:35] <uGoMobi> when it is just production, updating a site or something like that
[14:20:39] <agcolom> well paying the bills is necessary...
[14:20:44] <uGoMobi> not much creativity involved
[14:21:03] <uGoMobi> yeah i know, but can be frustrating when you look back if you what i mean
[14:21:09] <agcolom> I see, creative is the word I was going to use too, but you ewere faster ;-)
[14:21:32] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:21:34] <agcolom> yes, but you're young and everything...
[14:21:47] <uGoMobi> how about you? how did you end up at the university?
[14:21:55] <uGoMobi> or never left it?
[14:22:26] <agcolom> I did my degree in France, and my final year project at the University...
[14:22:43] <agcolom> then they offered me to pay my fees if I stayed...
[14:22:58] <agcolom> so I stayed and did an MPhil...
[14:23:20] <agcolom> then I did some web dev for the uni site...
[14:23:27] <uGoMobi> sorry what is MPhil?
[14:23:34] <agcolom> then they asked if I wanted a teaching post....
[14:24:09] <agcolom> I accepted... I had 3x6month contracts.... then a permanent position....
[14:24:32] <agcolom> so I've never looked for anything... it just all happened....
[14:24:48] <uGoMobi> yeah i see
[14:25:14] <agcolom> MPhil is Master of Philosophy.... just before the PhD
[14:25:26] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[14:26:03] <uGoMobi> happy about where it all brought you or sometimes in doubt if you want other work environment?
[14:26:10] <agcolom> I developed a mobile app for nurses on the Hitachi Possible 1 in 1998! The device was all in Japanese!
[14:26:20] <uGoMobi> wow cool!
[14:27:07] <uGoMobi> then you can probably fix that issue with Japanese characters ;-)
[14:27:13] <agcolom> It was good fun :-) So I've been in the mobile area for a very long time ! Yes maybe it was in 1997/1998... I finished in 1999
[14:27:15] <uGoMobi> with look it up and assign you
[14:27:37] <uGoMobi> will*
[14:28:24] <agcolom> The funny thing was when I uploaded the SW for the first time, I got a mesage in japanese... I thought it was an error. It was friday afternoon, so already friday night in Japan...
[14:29:06] <agcolom> Couldn't contact the contact we had there.... So just sent a fax with the transcribed message...
[14:29:32] <agcolom> (I did try 2/3 times to upload, and each time I was getting the same message...)
[14:30:27] <agcolom> And on monday the response was on the fax machine... the message was "software upload successful, retart the device to be able to launch the app!!!!!"
[14:30:35] <uGoMobi> hahahha
[14:33:06] <uGoMobi> reminds me about first time working with Git... seeing messages and dont have a clue what it is about
[14:33:35] <uGoMobi> but at least it english, not japanese :)
[14:34:55] <uGoMobi> the first manual i looked at made me think about chemistry at school... those schemes
[14:35:30] <uGoMobi> just like molecules :)
[14:36:37] <agcolom> yes, that's true actually !
[14:36:50] <agcolom> BTW do you have an iPAd 3?
[14:36:58] <uGoMobi> nope
[14:37:21] <uGoMobi> i really need to get some new gear :)
[14:38:02] <agcolom> never mind :-) there seems to be an issue with text inputs in iframes and JQM but only on the iPAd 3.... well I haven't tried the iPad 2.... but iPad 1 is ok...
[14:38:05] <uGoMobi> only have a buggy android device#
[14:38:16] <uGoMobi> i see
[14:38:29] <uGoMobi> i think Maurice has an iPad3
[14:38:54] <agcolom> Yes new gear is good, but expensive... I got all mine through uni projects... I get paid in gadgets...
[14:39:10] <uGoMobi> hehe
[14:39:14] <uGoMobi> not bad
[14:39:38] <agcolom> yes, they are very handy as well :-) kids enjoy them too ;-)
[14:39:58] <agcolom> yes, Maurice just confirmed the issue on the iPad 3.
[14:40:10] <uGoMobi> have two new projects so when finished and paid i can go shopping :)
[14:40:58] <agcolom> Excellent ;-)
[14:41:09] <agcolom> That's the spirit!
[14:41:15] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:48:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Anne, is there a place where we list know browser bugs?
[14:48:33] <uGoMobi> in other words, bugs that we can't fix
[14:48:56] <agcolom> Scott Jehl has a repo for that sort of stuff I think...
[14:50:00] <agcolom> https://github.com/scottjehl/Device-Bugs
[14:50:10] <uGoMobi> yeah I know what you mean, but I thought that was more for the big issues
[14:50:21] <uGoMobi> going to give that another look
[14:50:22] <uGoMobi> thanks
[14:50:38] <agcolom> yes, this one is for known device bugs...
[14:50:50] <agcolom> you mean JQM bugs with some devices?
[14:51:06] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:51:49] <uGoMobi> i was wrong... it is meant for any kind of bug
[14:52:03] <uGoMobi> do we "advertise" this somewhere?
[14:52:23] <uGoMobi> so that people first check it before opening issue :)
[14:52:55] <agcolom> no not really I think...
[14:53:00] <uGoMobi> the reason why I ask...
[14:53:09] <gseguin> Hiya everyone, just in case you haven't noticed it's a holiday in the US of A today
[14:53:22] <uGoMobi> turns out that with the old iPhone there is an issue with rounded buttons
[14:53:42] <uGoMobi> you can fix this with bit of CSS
[14:53:45] <agcolom> Hi, yes we noticed :-) all quiet in IRC ;-)
[14:54:03] <gseguin> heh :)
[14:54:18] <agcolom> and most of Europe was off today to! (not UK)
[14:54:23] <uGoMobi> but we cant use it in the framework because you can set the border-radius yourself... doesnt need to be rounded
[14:54:24] <agcolom> too
[14:54:45] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[14:55:01] <uGoMobi> holiday here too, only Anne had to work today ;)
[14:55:35] <uGoMobi> UK always wants to do things a little bit different
[14:55:36] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:56:05] <agcolom> johnbeder: what do you think about adding an entry in the Readme to mention checking device bugs at  https://github.com/scottjehl/Device-Bugs before assuming it is a JQM bug?
[14:56:12] <gseguin> true fact
[14:56:30] <uGoMobi> thats a good one Anne
[14:56:36] <agcolom> yes, UK cannot even drive on the right side of the road!!!!!
[14:56:55] <uGoMobi> exactly
[14:57:13] <uGoMobi> different time zone
[14:57:17] <uGoMobi> diffent currency
[14:57:23] <uGoMobi> different even
[14:57:36] <agcolom> yes... I'm seeing the Euro go down at the moment....
[14:58:11] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:58:41] <agcolom> massive change in just about 3 weeks...
[14:59:05] <uGoMobi> i always knew it is better to have no money ;)
[15:01:30] <agcolom> yes I think you're right :-)
[15:01:52] <agcolom> I wonder what's going to happen with Greece...
[15:02:14] <uGoMobi> the Greeks go the UK ;)
[15:02:36] <uGoMobi> at least thats what the UK goverment is afraid of
[15:03:41] <uGoMobi> Note to anyone who is reading this... this is still jQuery Mobile dev channel ;-)
[15:07:54] <agcolom> Yes, let's focus on JQM ;-)
[15:08:17] <agcolom> is your Android phone dead or still working?
[15:09:20] <uGoMobi> phone is working, but buggy... still have to reinstall Android 2.3
[15:10:11] <uGoMobi> Android 4 is only trouble for my phone
[15:10:34] <uGoMobi> that bug report repo from Scott is not only meant for JQM
[15:10:45] <uGoMobi> so can't put workaround in there
[15:11:06] <agcolom> no it's a general device issue....
[15:11:13] <uGoMobi> maybe we need our own list
[15:11:40] <uGoMobi> also things like... on Opera you will always see native select menu
[15:11:43] <agcolom> Yes, maybe that's an idea... where we could add workarounds...
[15:11:50] <uGoMobi> yup
[15:12:01] <agcolom> Have you tried popups in Opera mini?
[15:12:01] <uGoMobi> on the wiki page probably
[15:12:13] <agcolom> yes, possibly...
[15:12:21] <uGoMobi> and direct link on jquerymobile.com to the wiki maybe
[15:16:45] <agcolom> ok... bedtime for me...
[15:18:00] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper, goodnight Ghislain...
[15:18:23] <gseguin> good night Anne
[15:18:23] <agcolom> uGoMobi ^ gseguin ^
[15:18:43] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[15:18:58] <agcolom> Speak soon...
[15:46:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you still there?
[16:26:03] <gseguin> now I am, what's up uGoMobi?
[16:26:36] <uGoMobi> gseguin: hi again - do you have any idea why font-size for mini is set to 12.5px?
[16:26:49] <uGoMobi> i mean... why .5?
[16:27:01] <uGoMobi> i didnt even know it was possible
[16:27:41] <gseguin> no idea, that would be a question for toddparker or Wilto
[16:27:56] <uGoMobi> ok, thanks anyway
[16:27:59] <gseguin> sorry
[16:28:31] <uGoMobi> no problem at all
