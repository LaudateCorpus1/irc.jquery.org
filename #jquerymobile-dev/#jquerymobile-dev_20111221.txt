[03:28:37] <_|Nix|_> Is this a problem? jquery.ui.widget.js adds the class ui-state-disabled when disabled is set to true, but jqm defines no such class. OTOH, it defines ui-disabled, which has all the right stuff for making a widget appear disabled. So, why isn't ui-disabled called ui-state-disabled, or, alternatively, why doesn't $.ui.widget set ui-disabled and not ui-state-disabled?

[05:15:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/new-transitions] made the loader more subtle and added some examples - scottjehl
[05:57:08] <_|Nix|_> So, what's with this discrepancy between ui-disabled and ui-state-disabled? $.Widget adds ui-state-disabled when handling _setOption("disabled", true), whereas the ui-state-disabled class doesn't even exist in jqm. OTOH, we have ui-disabled. So, I find myself writing this.element[value ? "addClass" : "removeClass"]("ui-disabled"); in pretty much all of my widgets, when I could be getting this functionality for free if only the class were called u
[05:57:35] <_|Nix|_> Is this intentional?
[05:59:53] <_|Nix|_> I'd love to just be able to define widget: function( return this.element.add(this.widgetPart1).add(this.widgetPart2)...;} and restrict my concentration to special things I need to do in addition to this ...

[08:07:41] <rwaldron> anyone home?
[08:08:58] <Wilto> ’Sup.
[08:09:15] <Wilto> Wat’cha need, rwaldron?
[08:09:20] <rwaldron> hey dude
[08:09:47] <rwaldron> so, I'm at a client's right now and I have a ticket regarding transitions in Firefox
[08:09:52] <rwaldron> (jquery mobile obvs)
[08:10:22] <rwaldron> the app is intended to work in both mobile and desktop with jQuery Mobile
[08:12:58] <toddmparker_> hey rick
[08:13:24] <toddmparker_> rwaldron: when we were working on 1.0, FF didn't support KF animation
[08:13:49] <toddmparker_> we had planned on switching to transitions to bring FF and Opera support, but we bailed when that killed Opera Mobile perf
[08:13:59] <toddmparker_> and FF mobile didn't support it yet anyway
[08:14:17] <toddmparker_> we're in the middle of re-working transitions for 1.1
[08:14:28] <toddmparker_> and we're keeping FF in mind
[08:14:31] <rwaldron> Great, thanks guys
[08:14:58] <toddmparker_> so if it's a priority for the client, you could add the moz rules to your css
[08:15:04] <toddmparker_> and it would bring transitions to desktop
[08:15:25] <toddmparker_> we just may not make that change for the short term
[08:15:36] <toddmparker_> need to figure out our plan over over all int eh re-vamp
[08:18:22] <rwaldron> oh, awesome
[08:18:26] <rwaldron> so.. um...
[08:18:43] * rwaldron doesn't know much about these "moz rules"
[08:19:38] <rwaldron> toddmparker_ can you point me to any references for adding those rules? (btw, thanks to both you and Wilto for helping me out)
[08:19:58] <Wilto> Anytime, broseph. jquery.mobile.transitions.css
[08:20:23] <Wilto> It’s all pretty well broken-down in there.
[08:21:00] <Wilto> You’re basically just duplicating the -webkit rules with -moz prefixes instead.
[08:21:14] <Wilto> No syntactical difference.
[08:22:46] <toddmparker_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/@keyframes
[08:22:59] <toddmparker_> yep
[08:23:04] <toddmparker_> what Wilto said
[08:23:05] <rwaldron> word
[08:23:08] <rwaldron> that's awesome
[08:23:12] <rwaldron> you guys rule
[08:23:40] <Wilto> All in a day’s work, sir.
[08:26:49] <Wilto> Keep in mind they’re only gonna work in FF5+, but older versions just won’t get a transition—no harm done.
[08:29:12] <toddmparker_> scott's been hacking on transitions, here's an early experiement - http://filamentgroup.com/tests/jqm-transitions-1/
[08:30:05] <ajpiano> lol toddmparker_, i had the same reaction you just did
[08:30:21] <toddmparker_> re: translations?
[08:30:25] <ajpiano> ya
[08:30:32] <ajpiano> i was like o_0
[08:30:33] <toddmparker_> hope he know hebrew
[08:30:59] <Wilto> wat

[09:08:35] <Wilto> Perhaps git and I have finally reached an understanding.
[09:48:16] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so are we meeting with you guys?
[09:48:34] <kinblas> Wilto: ^^^
[10:08:43] <gseguin> morning all
[10:12:57] <gseguin> toddmparker_: do we have a call with nokia?
[10:17:39] <kinblas> gseguin: guess not. :-)

[10:26:24] <johnbender> gseguin: the test suite is holding up well
[10:28:46] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm on jqm today
[10:29:08] <gseguin> did you leave anything for me?
[10:29:09] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I'm going offline for a couple of hours around 11:30 so feel free to take over where I left off with the test suite
[10:29:25] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I think I'm about half way
[10:29:26] <johnbender> let me look
[10:29:51] <johnbender> gseguin: definitely leave navigation to me
[10:29:54] <johnbender> thats a bramble
[10:30:03] <johnbender> and I might not even bother in that case since it's "core"
[10:30:12] <gseguin> ok
[10:30:14] <johnbender> gseguin: listview is the other huge and finicky set
[10:30:22] <johnbender> but that one is important
[10:30:33] <johnbender> one sec let me see what's left
[10:30:52] <gseguin> git fetch
[10:30:54] <gseguin>  + f80904a...5de358b css-fixed  -> upstream/css-fixed  (forced update)
[10:30:58] <gseguin> WAT?
[10:31:10] <gseguin> who forced pushed?
[10:31:25] <johnbender> gseguin: I saw scott did last night
[10:31:37] <johnbender> gseguin: its a branch so I didn't say anything :(
[10:31:38] <gseguin> DAMMIT SCOTT
[10:31:51] <gseguin> :)
[10:34:35] <gseguin> johnbender: did you see my comment on github?
[10:34:53] <gseguin> why do you need the load to be sequential ?
[10:38:57] <johnbender> gseguin: well it's not strictly sequential
[10:39:05] <johnbender> gseguin: its sequential chunks :/
[10:39:38] <johnbender> gseguin: some of the tests require that bindings fire before the tests are run so we need init to after the tests in some cases
[10:39:52] <johnbender> in the general case the tests should run after init
[10:40:39] <gseguin> oh got it, I had missed that the seq arg is an array of arrays
[10:40:50] <johnbender> gseguin: yah, its not very elegant but it works for now
[10:41:10] <gseguin> no that's cool, just the comment is misleading I think
[10:41:37] <johnbender> gseguin: the one above the helper?
[10:41:42] <gseguin> yeah
[10:41:49] <johnbender> gseguin: kk I'll clarify
[10:42:22] <gseguin> it's not really synchronous
[10:42:55] <johnbender> gseguin: expr `ls -l tests/unit/ | grep "^d" | wc -l` - `ack asyncLoad tests/unit/ | sed "s/\(.*\)\/.*/\1/" | sort | uniq | wc -l`
[10:43:11] <johnbender> some command line fuckery to figure out how many test unit directories there are
[10:43:25] <johnbender> it doesn't take into account that in some cases the load will need to be added to more than one file
[10:43:43] <gseguin> zsh: command not found: ack
[10:43:43] <gseguin> 22
[10:44:01] <johnbender> gseguin: ack-grep
[10:44:02] <johnbender> awesome tool
[10:44:07] <johnbender> let me try with grep -R
[10:44:38] <johnbender> gseguin: s/ack/grep -R/ appears to work
[10:53:39] <gseguin> thanks
[11:15:38] <gseguin> johnbender: in AMD if you specify a dependency with the .js extension the path to it is relative to the html file that includes it
[11:15:51] <gseguin> as if you were writing a <script tag
[11:18:38] <johnbender> gseguin: nice
[11:18:47] <johnbender> gseguin: so we can get rid of that base url crap
[11:19:00] <gseguin> yep that's where I was going
[11:19:29] <johnbender> gseguin: kk I'll do that now and change the comment
[11:19:40] <gseguin> cool
[11:22:39] <johnbender> gseguin: brilliant
[11:31:09] <johnbender> gseguin: I must have left some failures in the controlgroup tests
[11:31:17] <johnbender> don't worry about those I'll handle them when I get baack

[12:40:51] <toddmparker_> hey guys, sorry
[12:41:01] <kinblas> boo hiss hiss
[12:41:03] <toddmparker_> i sort of got caught talking and couldnt' break away
[12:41:04] <kinblas> :-)
[12:41:18] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so how did it look?
[12:41:19] <toddmparker_> you guys couldn't hear it, all under NDA
[12:41:27] <toddmparker_> i cannot confirm or deny
[12:41:34] <kinblas> ok so it doesn't exist
[12:41:36] <toddmparker_> i do not recall
[12:41:44] <toddmparker_> seak to my lawyer
[12:42:10] <toddmparker_> it's good that they are connecting with the project on so many fronts
[12:42:33] <kinblas> toddmparker_: can you say if it is WP7?
[12:42:40] <toddmparker_> we're just helping them understand what features are key to having jQM work on their platforms
[12:42:41] <kinblas> or what browser?
[12:42:43] <toddmparker_> no, but no
[12:42:47] <toddmparker_> :)
[12:42:47] <kinblas> lol
[12:43:00] <toddmparker_> these are for other nokia platforms
[12:43:15] <toddmparker_> so they want to get you guys under NDA so you can be in these covnersations
[12:43:22] <toddmparker_> you're not missing anything super cool
[12:43:34] <kinblas> "I can neither confirm nor deny my involvement or non-involvement in discussions of my involvement or lack there-of"
[12:43:51] <toddmparker_> but we're helping make sure jQM will work for the most people
[12:44:01] <toddmparker_> yeah, what you said kinblas
[12:44:03] <kinblas> yeah that's standard
[12:44:10] <kinblas> modus operandus
[12:44:11] <Wilto> We’re philanthropists, really.
[12:44:19] <toddmparker_> you adobe guys are never very forthcoming with products stuff eitehr
[12:44:24] <kinblas> Wilto: funny, I don't have any money
[12:44:39] <toddmparker_> you gonna implement that anti-crashing feature I need in Illustrator?
[12:44:43] <Wilto> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JBvfZTx-vs is how I conduct myself in these tense NDA situations.
[12:45:50] <toddmparker_> so what did i miss?
[12:45:50] <Wilto> …All situations, really.
[12:49:32] <kinblas> toddmparker: ha ha
[12:50:20] <kinblas> Wilto: heh
[12:50:48] <Wilto> I made the Nokia guys give me $200, is what I’m getting at.
[12:52:54] <kinblas> toddmparker: I've been feeling particularly verbose in my issue replies today, I cc'd you on a few that need thegroups feedback
[13:01:57] <toddmparker_> yeah, you're a chatty Kathy kinblas
[13:02:12] <kinblas> lol
[13:02:28] <toddmparker_> thanks for looking at the base stuff and sergey's q's
[13:02:30] <kinblas> toddmparker_: pent up jqm energy
[13:02:37] <toddmparker_> keep going!
[13:02:58] <kinblas> toddmparker_: will do
[13:03:13] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so are you guys working the hole holiday?
[13:03:24] <kinblas> whole I meant
[13:03:33] * kinblas doesn't know of any holidays for holes
[13:05:29] <Wilto> No. Ludacrismas makes special provisions for “hos,” I believe, but that’s it.
[13:05:40] <Wilto> #inappropriatehiphopjokes
[13:05:54] <toddmparker_> oh bother
[13:06:08] <toddmparker_> (been reading lots of winnie the pooh)
[13:06:20] <toddmparker_> anyone have an iphone running 4.x
[13:06:43] <toddmparker_> 4.2 specificially
[13:07:11] <Wilto> 4.3.2 is the closest I’ve got.
[13:10:20] <kinblas> Wilto: lol
[13:11:17] <kinblas> toddmparker: I have a 2nd gen ipod with 4.2.1
[13:18:51] <toddmparker_> perfect
[13:19:00] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3306#issuecomment-3232374
[13:19:01] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3306 on jquery-mobile, reported by Neiru (1d, 10h ago): iPhone4 browser back button
[13:19:08] <toddmparker_> just open the 1.0 demos, load a page and hit back
[13:19:11] <toddmparker_> does ajax hang?
[13:34:22] <toddmparker_> "I unashamedly maintain that there is so much more to being successful on the mobile web than dealing with screen size. But I do accept that dealing with screen size is at least a first step." :) :) :) :) :) :/
[13:38:12] <toddmparker_> ignore that
[13:38:15] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it doesn't hang per-se
[13:38:22] <kinblas> but what it looks like is that when I hit the back button
[13:38:29] <kinblas> we transition to the previous page
[13:38:38] <toddmparker_> does the url come down and stay?
[13:38:38] <kinblas> but the URL bar is reset so that it looks like it is loading something
[13:38:46] <toddmparker_> harumph
[13:38:48] <kinblas> and the spinner in the status bar keeps going
[13:38:50] <toddmparker_> and ideas?
[13:39:06] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I think this comes from the same place where just setting the hash causes the URL bar to drop down
[13:39:18] <kinblas> it's not really loading, but it dropped it down and got set as if it were going to load something
[13:39:24] <toddmparker_> but it used to pop back up
[13:40:05] <toddmparker_> same on rc1 kinblas
[13:40:06] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc1/
[13:40:10] <toddmparker_> or older?
[13:41:22] <kinblas> toddmparker_: is pushstate enabled on 4.2?
[13:41:29] <kinblas> I wonder if it started once we landed that
[13:41:44] <toddmparker_> don't think so, no
[13:41:53] <toddmparker_> you see hash urls, right?
[13:42:57] <kinblas> hang on a sec I'm loading an alpha to see if it was in 4.1
[13:44:29] <kinblas> toddmparker_: loading of http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1 never seems to complete though the page looks like it's all there and I can scroll and interact
[13:44:51] <toddmparker_> odd
[13:44:59] <toddmparker_> seems like we would have seen this
[13:45:10] <toddmparker_> wonder if there was a 4.x update that made this worse
[13:45:39] <kinblas> running the older versions makes me appreciate the latest which is faster
[13:48:17] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah all of the alphas I tried hang on load
[13:50:00] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[13:50:10] <kinblas> yeah hmmm it must just be my ipod
[13:50:18] <toddmparker_> must be an update. we would have seen that
[13:50:27] <toddmparker_> that other guy is reporting the same
[13:50:40] <toddmparker_> but 4.x was our test platform until recently
[13:50:47] <toddmparker_> tho maybe only 4.2
[13:50:50] <toddmparker_> and we were on 4.3?
[13:55:48] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I know that my ipad has been on 4.3.5 for a long while
[13:56:40] <toddmparker_> yeah
[13:56:48] <toddmparker_> think this is fixable??
[13:57:58] <kinblas> toddmparker_: we just need to figure out what it is first
[13:59:27] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I have a feeling it has to do with the hashes

[14:39:22] <Wilto> This is why I’m always saying we should delete all those semicolons I keep seeing all over the place. Trim them files down.
[14:47:28] <toddmparker_> kinblas or garann - do you know how to get the gzipped sizes of our js and css files?
[14:47:45] <toddmparker_> i want to double check our numbers, don't think we updated those at the end
[14:47:51] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/download/
[14:48:41] <kinblas> toddmparker_: not sure if folks just gzip the resulting files and give that number
[14:48:46] <kinblas> perhaps a question for jeresig?
[14:48:52] <toddmparker_> i think so
[14:49:03] <toddmparker_> but how to do that? scott used to do it on the command line
[14:49:11] <kinblas> oh just use gzip
[14:49:13] <kinblas> on mac
[14:49:46] <kinblas> toddmparker_: if you hang on I can download the min files and gzip
[14:49:52] <toddmparker_> k
[14:50:00] <toddmparker_> just want that to be accurate
[14:50:06] <gseguin> just did it for jquery.mobile-1.0.min.js
[14:50:11] <gseguin> it's 24K
[14:50:28] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ^
[14:50:40] <toddmparker_> cool
[14:50:55] <Wilto> So, we’re calling shenanigans on that chart, then?
[14:51:16] <gseguin> absolutely!
[14:51:16] <toddmparker_> so core is like 229k min and 31k gzipped
[14:51:33] <toddmparker_> well, we need the # for css
[14:51:36] <toddmparker_> and images
[14:51:36] <gseguin> lemme get the css
[14:51:49] <Wilto> Oh, just the JS. Nevermind.
[14:51:51] <toddmparker_> though with images, you should only count 1 sprite
[14:52:14] <toddmparker_> gseguin: can you do the same for the full css and the 36px white icon + spinner?
[14:52:18] <gseguin> 7.8K for the CSS
[14:53:01] <toddmparker_> do images get compressed more?
[14:53:56] <gseguin> don't think so
[14:55:30] <gseguin> the 2 images account for 8K
[14:55:45] <Wilto> Hm.
[14:55:55] <Wilto> So we’re calling very slight shenanigans on that chart.
[14:56:11] <gseguin> wait sorry
[14:56:15] <toddmparker_> very slight
[14:56:36] <Wilto> I just like saying “shenanigans.”
[14:56:49] <gseguin> hold on I messed the images
[14:56:59] <toddmparker_> k
[14:57:09] <gseguin> it's 4K
[14:57:23] <toddmparker_> cool
[14:57:41] <gseguin> so we're at ~36K
[14:59:07] <Wilto> 66.8k in total.
[14:59:25] <Wilto> Way to round up, Kaneda.
[14:59:52] <toddmparker_> ;-)
[15:00:12] <gseguin> Yeah I'd be curious what / how he sized it
[15:00:18] <toddmparker_> :{  liar!
[15:00:38] <toddmparker_> it seems close enough
[15:00:53] <toddmparker_> sure there was a dancing cat gif in his version
[15:01:53] <gseguin> he should have taken the size of jquery.mobile-1.0.zip
[15:02:02] <gseguin> 1.0MB much rounder number
[15:02:06] <Wilto> Or just the parts of our code that work on iOS.
[15:02:10] <Wilto> BUUURN
[15:02:50] <Wilto> ( http://wil.to/_/haters.gif )
[15:04:48] <toddmparker_> best haters ever
[15:15:11] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to css-fixed: http://git.io/BHIM8A
[15:15:11] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/css-fixed] Changed the z-index of the slider handle from 10 and 20 to 1 for both types to prevent it from running over the fixed toolbars - toddparker
[15:21:46] <Wilto> So, I pulled the ACTUAL dialog refactor stuff into a new branch.
[15:21:57] <Wilto> kinblas: Do you know how to rename a branch?
[15:22:17] <Wilto> kinblas: The old dialog-refactor should probably still kick around for a while just in case, but no one should be committing anything there.
[15:22:26] <Wilto> Just paranoid about deleting anything.
[15:24:17] <Wilto> gseguin ^
[15:24:36] * gseguin reads
[15:25:07] <Wilto> dialog-refactor just became “put experimental stuff here,” so I spent some time getting things into feature-specific branches today.
[15:25:22] <gseguin> "git branch -m" to move/rename a branch
[15:25:22] <Wilto> Some of the half-baked ones I just have locally.
[15:25:37] <Wilto> git branch -m "new-name" ?
[15:25:57] <Wilto> Me and terminal, we ain’t so buddy-buddy.
[15:26:26] <gseguin> git branch -m <oldbranch> <newbranch>
[15:26:35] <Wilto> Keep in mind this branch is up in the remote repo, so I dunno if renaming will cause chaos for everyone or what.
[15:27:18] <gseguin> that should rename the remote branch, if not, it's easy to delete the old one after you pushed
[15:27:38] <Wilto> Alright. I’m getting a “DAMMIT SCOTT” ready just in case, though.
[15:27:46] <gseguin> :)
[15:29:14] <gseguin> there is no real risk of loosing data, a branch is just a pointer to a tree in git
[15:29:22] <Wilto> Are there any naming conventions for “DON’T COMMIT STUFF HERE?”
[15:29:44] <Wilto> “old,” “defunct,” “LEAVE-ME-ALONE,” etc?
[15:30:00] <gseguin> defunct sounds good
[15:30:22] <gseguin> why don't you delete it ? is it meant to be merged to master eventually?
[15:31:17] <Wilto> Paranoia.
[15:31:32] <Wilto> Lots of stuff moving around—I’d rather keep it for a day or two, just in case something got lost in the shuffle.
[15:31:44] <gseguin> yeah no problem
[15:31:55] <gseguin> much easier to remember a name than a SHA
[15:32:02] <Wilto> Exactly.
[15:32:04] <gseguin> at least for me and you
[15:32:05] <Wilto> And what a name it is.
[15:32:11] <Wilto> “post-1.0-experiments-DEFUNCT”
[15:32:18] <Wilto> I am thorough, if nothing else.
[15:32:34] <gseguin> heh, :)
[15:34:06] <Wilto> So… If I do “git push origin post-1.0-experiments-DEFUNCT” does git know what’s goin’ on here?
[15:34:12] <Wilto> Renames the remote and such for me?
[15:35:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto created post-1.0-experiments-DEFUNCT (+1 new commit): http://git.io/gsri6A
[15:35:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/post-1.0-experiments-DEFUNCT] Fixed preloader/fetched content fade transition, removed odd ‘snap’ when content size varies. - Mat Marquis
[15:35:23] <Wilto> Hrm.
[15:36:23] <gseguin> looks like it didn't remove the old one, did it?
[15:36:55] <gseguin> Wilto: ^
[15:37:12] <Wilto> Naw.
[15:37:57] <Wilto> “git push -f origin :dialog-refactor”
[15:37:59] <gseguin> just do: git push upstream :dialog-refactor
[15:38:05] <gseguin> no need for -f
[15:38:09] <Wilto> Oh, whew, no -f needed.
[15:38:31] <Wilto> Bam.
[15:38:34] <kinblas_> anyone ping me earlier on irc? My window is blinking on my mac but I can't switch to my chat client cause I'm running tests.
[15:38:49] <Wilto> kinblas: I had git troubles, but I think we’re good now.
[15:39:02] <gseguin> Wilto: did you push ?
[15:39:09] <Wilto> That I did.
[15:39:26] <Wilto> And it is gone. Awesome.
[15:39:29] <Wilto> Thanks, gseguin!
[15:40:12] <gseguin> you're welcome
[15:40:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to popup: http://git.io/TYPpXA
[15:40:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup] Tweaked some of the popup example styles - toddparker
[15:50:26] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm back if you need me
[15:52:26] <toddmparker_> thanks johnbender
[15:52:31] <toddmparker_> think mat figured it out
[15:52:43] <toddmparker_> just emailed the new branch list for stuff we're working on
[15:52:56] <toddmparker_> we need to clean up some of these older branches
[15:52:59] <toddmparker_> if we can
[15:53:13] <toddmparker_> i'm heading out...you around tomorrow?
[15:53:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I'll be online during the day
[15:53:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I read the stuff about Mr. Kaneda's post
[15:53:48] <johnbender> :/
[15:53:49] <johnbender> oh well
[15:54:01] <toddmparker_> it's fine
[15:54:02] <johnbender> Wilto: did his numbers include core?
[15:54:16] <toddmparker_> compared to jQtouch which is webkit (iOS) only
[15:54:21] <toddmparker_> and has less features
[15:54:26] <toddmparker_> not apples to apples
[15:54:40] <toddmparker_> mobile itself is pretty small
[15:54:52] <toddmparker_> same size as core really, which is good for a full UI library
[15:55:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so ours is 70k without core included?
[15:55:25] <toddmparker_> once we get the DL builder in, we can lighten up, make some plugin/extensions optional and unchecked by default
[15:55:32] <johnbender> yassir
[15:55:35] <toddmparker_> nested lists, custom selects
[15:55:40] <toddmparker_> etc.
[15:55:45] <johnbender> gseguin: how goes it
[15:55:46] <johnbender> ?
[15:55:46] <toddmparker_> ok, gotta run
[15:55:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: peace!
[15:55:52] <toddmparker_> talk to you later
[15:56:00] <gseguin> toddmparker_: talk to you tomorrow
[15:56:05] <gseguin> johnbender: good
[15:56:26] <gseguin> I'm at the support test
[15:56:46] <gseguin> the reloadLib isn't playing so well with requirejs
[15:56:57] <gseguin> there is a way to do it with requirejs
[15:57:21] <gseguin> but it's not very convenient
[15:58:01] <gseguin> johnbender: ^ you can create a context in requirejs and reload the same resource
[15:58:23] <gseguin> but that requires that your test is async
[15:58:46] <gseguin> then you can't have several asyncTest doing that in the same test suite
[15:58:48] <johnbender> gseguin: those are coreish
[15:58:55] <johnbender> I wouldn't worry about it too much
[15:59:00] <gseguin> does that make sense?
[16:00:01] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[16:00:24] <johnbender> gseguin: if the reload of the library can take a callback we should be able to call start() in there no?
[16:00:48] <gseguin> johnbender: yes
[16:00:50] <johnbender> I'm not clear why we can't have several tests in the same suite
[16:01:06] <johnbender> given that we can call start as a callback
[16:01:22] <gseguin> but then if you have another asyncTest that does the same kind of funky business
[16:01:36] <gseguin> it'll step on the toes of your previous test
[16:01:45] <johnbender> asyncTest is build to serialize tests
[16:01:48] <johnbender> right?
[16:02:21] <johnbender> so as long as we don't start the next test until the load and testing code is finished we should be fine
[16:02:31] <johnbender> I might be missing something here
[16:02:50] <gseguin> let me try one more time
[16:02:58] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[16:03:03] <johnbender> feel free to gist it
[16:03:15] <johnbender> or push to a personal branch and link
[16:04:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 8 new commits to amd: http://git.io/X4nluQ
[16:04:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] Added dep on textinput - Ghislain Seguin
[16:04:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] Added dep on page and page.sections (for nested lists) - Ghislain Seguin
[16:04:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] AMDized - Ghislain Seguin
[16:05:45] <johnbender> gseguin: just wanted to double check
[16:06:14] <gseguin> johnbender: that push doesn't have these changes
[16:06:24] <johnbender> the use of the order plugin in the control group test, does that indicate a missing dependency definition in the js?
[16:06:34] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[16:06:41] <johnbender> thats what I wanted to check
[16:06:59] <johnbender> I doesn't seem like it does given the two plugins
[16:07:14] <johnbender> I'm assuming the test just requires checkbox radio's and happens to put them in a control group?
[16:07:19] <gseguin> no it's just that the control group enhancement has to happen after the button enhancement
[16:07:29] <johnbender> ah
[16:07:34] <johnbender> it sets the corner css, etc
[16:07:38] <gseguin> yep
[16:07:55] <gseguin> that's what I was talking about yesterday
[16:08:08] <gseguin> right now we blindly register pageshow handlers
[16:08:09] <johnbender> gseguin: since buttonMarkup is a dep shouldn't it be placed before it automatically?
[16:08:16] <gseguin> and the order is important
[16:08:33] <gseguin> I think if we go with that modular approach
[16:09:01] <gseguin> we should have a registration system where we can assign a weight / priority to the handler we register
[16:09:05] <johnbender> gseguin: do you mean pagecreate handlers or are you talking about other plugins?
[16:09:18] <gseguin> yes sorry pagecreate
[16:09:24] <johnbender> gseguin: yah we've talked about moving away from the create pagecreate stuff
[16:09:31] <johnbender> that's *too* decoupled
[16:09:38] <johnbender> kin and I agree with you there
[16:09:46] <johnbender> then at least we can do sane things
[16:09:49] <johnbender> actually
[16:10:03] <johnbender> that problems is sort of solved in Vagrant
[16:10:11] <johnbender> with a general purpose middleware
[16:10:15] <johnbender> eeentereting
[16:10:20] <johnbender> I'll cogitate on that a bit
[16:10:31] * kinblas jots down "cogitate"
[16:14:07] <johnbender> oh you guys are in for it now
[16:14:33] <johnbender> middleware is the perfect fit for this
[16:34:00] <Wilto> I see johnbender hasn’t quit the project, so my git hijinx must not have gone too poorly.
[16:35:40] <johnbender> Wilto: lol
[16:35:48] <johnbender> It's source control we can always figure it out :D
[16:35:49] <johnbender> well
[16:35:50] <johnbender> mostly
[16:35:52] <johnbender> lol
[16:36:00] <Wilto> Hence my hesitation to nuke anything.
[16:36:13] <Wilto> I don’t know how nuked “nuked” really is.
[16:36:26] <johnbender> Wilto: as long as someone has a copy, including yourself we can always restore it
[16:36:47] <gseguin> that's the beauty of git
[16:37:07] <gseguin> johnbender: I think I nailed the support tests
[16:37:09] <Wilto> I also nuked all my local repos. Then split my MacBook over my knee.
[16:37:20] <Wilto> One can never be too careful, I say.
[16:37:37] <gseguin> lol
[16:37:41] <johnbender> gseguin: awesome
[16:37:47] <johnbender> gseguin: what was the solution?
[16:39:00] <gseguin> naming the module
[16:39:13] <gseguin> I was hitting: http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html#mismatch
[16:39:52] <gseguin> F yeah!
[16:41:47] <johnbender> gseguin: ahh with the reloadLib?
[16:41:59] <gseguin> yep
[16:42:04] <johnbender> makes sense
[16:42:04] <gseguin> got rid of it
[16:42:25] <gseguin> replaced it with a require with a different context
[16:42:28] <gseguin> pushing now
[16:42:46] <gseguin> might need some polish
[16:42:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to amd: http://git.io/3MpdyA
[16:42:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] Named the module for testability - Ghislain Seguin
[16:42:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] AMDized - Ghislain Seguin
[16:42:52] <gseguin> like a util function
[16:43:04] <gseguin> but that's the idea
[16:44:15] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[16:44:18] <kinblas> toddmparker_: Wilto: scottjehl: johnbender: gseguin: I'm steppin' out for the holidays ... hope y'all have a good xmas and new years!
[16:44:42] <gseguin> happy holidays kinblas!
[16:44:45] <Wilto> You too, kinblas!
[16:49:00] <johnbender> kinblas: best to you and yours buddy
[16:49:04] <johnbender> see you next year!
[16:49:25] * johnbender suspects he'll see kinblas nerding out online with the rest of us
[16:49:48] <johnbender> I'll be online tomorrow possible working through my plugin registration idea
[16:50:29] <gseguin> I'm working on jQM tomorrow
[17:24:02] <mrmax> hey toddmparker_ this is max from Codiqa.  I'm going to idle in here more often.
[17:26:22] <mrmax> maybe some of my jqm changes for Codiqa will end up being useful for jqm.
[17:38:05] <gseguin> hey mrmax, is it possible to have access to the beta ?
[17:38:48] <Wilto> Yeah, what gseguin said.
[17:38:58] <Wilto> Also: welcome mrmax!
[17:39:11] <gseguin> yeah, what Wilto  said.
[17:40:35] <mrmax> gseguin, Wilto, thanks.  Give me a sec and I'll post a link
[17:42:23] <Wilto> That is a badass beta signup page.
[17:43:36] <mrmax> http://api.appcelerator.net/p/pages/app_page?token=n4tjqry6
[17:43:38] <mrmax> Thanks :)
[17:43:57] <mrmax> We haven't launched quite yet, targeting the week after new years
[17:44:30] <gseguin> it looks very promising
[17:44:34] <gseguin> thanks for the link
[17:45:10] <mrmax> Basically, the goal is to support at least all of the jqm features, and theming and some more stuff.  And then build more premium services around the apps you make
[17:45:27] <Wilto> …Wow.
[17:46:08] <Wilto> mrmax: Okay if I post that link to the project’s Basecamp for toddmparker_ and Scott?
[17:47:08] <gseguin> it's pretty rad! great job mrmax
[17:47:18] <Wilto> Yeah, this is really impressive.
[17:48:33] <mrmax> sure, sounds good.  We are trying to keep it a bit private until we launch more publicly
[17:48:40] <Wilto> Absolutely.
[17:49:13] * gseguin has never heard of codiqua
[17:49:27] <mrmax> Thanks.  It's an early view of what we want to make. Hopefully it will be useful and we can go from there :)
[17:52:59] <mrmax> The next things we need to improve are forms, list views, and I'd love to get the primary/secondary structure that the jqm docs have to get sidebar content for tablet apps
[17:55:20] <Wilto> About time you got here, bot-t. I’ve been trying to object to things all day.
[17:55:25] <Wilto> ?OBJECTION
[17:55:26] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/objection.jpg
[17:55:48] <gseguin> how do you do that Wilto ?
[17:56:23] <gseguin> I mean, how do you teach bot-t?
[17:56:46] <Wilto> mrmax: Sounds good, man. The sidebar stuff is just a media query we’re using in the docs—I can see a couple of places where you guys would have the opportunity to add some styles via the app, too, since you’ll have some predictable variables.
[17:57:30] <Wilto> mrmax: Like, when you add horizontally-grouped buttons, you could update the CSS for two to 50% each, three buttons to 33% each, etc.
[17:57:44] <Wilto> And of course, we very much welcome anything you guys can contribute back to the project.
[17:58:10] <Wilto> bot-t: outrage is http://wil.to/_/outrage.gif
[17:58:11] <bot-t> Wilto, Stored "outrage".
[17:58:13] <Wilto> ?outrage
[17:58:14] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/outrage.gif
[17:58:30] <gseguin> oh cool
[17:58:35] <Wilto> bot-t: Wilto is What, Wilto? I hate that guy.
[17:58:36] <bot-t> Wilto, Changed "Wilto".
[17:58:38] <Wilto> ?Wilto
[17:58:38] <bot-t> What, Wilto? I hate that guy.
[17:58:52] <gseguin> and is it custom to the user?
[17:58:57] <gseguin> ?Wilto
[17:58:57] <bot-t> What, Wilto? I hate that guy.
[17:59:05] <gseguin> doesn't look like it
[17:59:09] <Wilto> Nope. It applies to any of the jQuery channels using bot-t.
[17:59:12] <gseguin> thanks!
[17:59:23] <mrmax> Wilto: I see what you mean.  We also have to fix the header button left/right stuff.  Todd has pointed that out to me several times :)
[18:00:25] <Wilto> Hah, yeah. This is really cool, though. Look forward to working with you, man.
[18:06:17] <mrmax> Thanks!  I'll ping you guys when we have some updates.  Like I said we are still trying to figure out our direction, and I'd love to get feedback or suggestions
[19:29:16] <TehShrike|Work> Wilto: that's quite a home page
