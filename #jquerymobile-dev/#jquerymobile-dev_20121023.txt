[05:18:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup] Only rapid-open the popup if it is open -- Fixes #5157 - Gabriel Schulhof
[05:28:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: If your closing issues i have a few that you can probably close.
[05:28:29] <uGoMobi> hi arschmitz !
[05:28:41] <uGoMobi> sure... which ones?
[05:28:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi hey
[05:29:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just a sec ill grab them
[05:29:06] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:29:24] <arschmitz> 5177
[05:29:56] <arschmitz> 5189
[05:30:19] <arschmitz> 5051
[05:30:34] <arschmitz> 4762
[05:31:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks!
[05:31:55] <frequent> oh. i thought you speak in numbers today
[05:32:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I saw that you and your wife are expecting a boy... congrats!!
[05:32:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes thank you very much!
[05:32:59] <uGoMobi> frequent: that is secret code... not meant for you ;-)
[05:33:15] <frequent> :-(
[05:33:59] <arschmitz> its our new scret code based on issue numbers we encode the message hidden in the issue discription its brilliant! Thats what we really did at the summit last week
[05:34:35] <frequent> ah. so if I want to tell you something, I submit a new issue with the message and then send you the number here?
[05:34:36] <frequent> COOL!
[05:34:37] <uGoMobi> yup, I got inspired when i was near Langley last week :D
[05:35:19] <arschmitz> execpt you have to HIDE it in the issue cant just say it or we will have no idea. its a coded riddle!
[05:35:38] <frequent> ok. still... lotta issues ;-)
[05:36:28] <frequent> so, I'm now waiting for a clients email who just tested his iPad application with IE6...
[05:36:48] <uGoMobi> frequent: didn't have time to look into those issues you mailed me after saturday, will do that today
[05:36:54] <frequent> sort of like take a can and a wire and try to hook up to a 3G network
[05:37:02] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:37:13] <frequent> uGoMobi: no problem. Still unsolved :-)
[05:37:37] <arschmitz> frequent: im sure it will be great ie6 has great css3 and html5 support right?
[05:38:04] <frequent> yeah. wonder if he complain he couldn't swipe anything on his PC...
[05:38:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Congrats!
[05:38:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thank you.
[05:40:51] <frequent> arschmitz: Congrats from me, too!
[05:42:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also check 5199, 5198, 5154 those can probably be closed too
[05:43:19] <arschmitz> frequent: thank you!
[05:43:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[05:43:40] <uGoMobi> I better start making a list :)
[05:44:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toddmparker: beat you to 5154
[05:44:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks a lot with helping with triage!
[05:45:13] <arschmitz> well im waiting for some more input on a fix iv been working on so i decided to try and drill down through some that either looked invalid or an easy fix. mostly invalid it turns out lol
[05:45:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks like toddmparker cracked our secret code then ;)
[05:45:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: damn i thought we were keeping that to people there the first day!
[05:46:09] <uGoMobi> :D
[05:47:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: probably tortured Wilto: for the code when they got back to filament!
[05:47:39] <uGoMobi> haha
[05:50:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5189 - the problem is that it doesn't work with "none"
[05:55:13] <frequent> imagines torturing for code and gets a coffee...
[06:04:05] <arschmitz> frequent: i think i need to start drinking coffee i always feel so left out :(
[06:58:36] <frequent> arschmitz: some speak in issues, some drink coffee ;-)
[06:59:30] <arschmitz> frequent: i guess we all have our talents
[06:59:38] <frequent> yup
[07:01:48] <Wilto> What’d I do?
[07:03:13] <arschmitz> Wilto: gave toddmparker our secret code of speaking in issues that was suposed to only be for people who were at the first day of the summit after he tortured you when you got back to filament. (Long Story ha ha)
[07:13:08] <Wilto> When doesn’t he torture me, really.

[09:01:43] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender Check out https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5214 ... that's handling reset without using a base class. Which one do you think is better?
[09:01:43] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[09:02:30] <_|Nix|_> gseguin, uGoMobi: Based on johnbender's comments, I made another PR, that does not introduce a base class. It's slightly more invasive, but perhaps it's worth it. ^
[09:02:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin, uGoMobi: Whaddya guys think? Which one looks better?
[09:13:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: looking, thanks for taking the time to look into an alternate
[09:13:24] <bot-t> (11 mins 40 secs ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender Check out https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5214 ... that's handling reset without using a base class. Which one do you think is better?
[10:12:47] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you might like this
[10:12:59] <johnbender> I think we should create a project convention for widget extension
[10:13:05] <johnbender> maybe the UI folks already have one?
[10:13:31] <johnbender> jzaefferer: do you guys have a convention for mixing in functionality to widgets in UI?
[10:13:35] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: ^
[10:16:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5214#issuecomment-9710077
[10:25:08] <johnbender> jzaefferer: NOTE this is one of those times where I think "UI probably has a solution for this" ;)
[10:25:59] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Yeah, $.widget() :-P
[10:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.tabs.js#L1224
[10:26:35] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: oh shiat
[10:27:01] <jzaefferer> What Scott said!
[10:27:15] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: thanks to the both of you
[10:28:35] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: I commented on the PR
[10:28:35] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#allow-redefining-widgets-to-create-extensions
[10:28:51] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: thank you sir
[10:29:06] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[10:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> If you want something with widgets, we've probably thought of it :-P
[10:29:27] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: exactly what I figured
[10:32:32] <jzaefferer> by now we even document it: http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget
[10:32:46] <jzaefferer> that page is a little unwieldy, but its all there
[10:33:39] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I used it yesterday in fact to link to the _on docs
[11:11:52] <ajpiano> hey folks
[11:12:08] <ajpiano> out of curiousity, and i know some of you may have been asked already
[11:13:00] <ajpiano> but if anyone has any interest in heading to south korea to speak at jquery conference asia on november 12, the organisers are very interested in trying to get another speaker about jQM even at this late date
[11:16:53] <ajpiano> please let me know this afternoon if you have some interest, and i certainly understand the crickets :)
[11:23:29] <johnbender> I have a child and therefore an excuse for nearly anything that demands my time :P)
[11:23:35] <johnbender> :P :)_
[11:24:07] <johnbender> ajpiano: seriosly though i would love to make the trip, I have friends (more family) there but it's a tough sell to the wife right now
[11:24:30] <ajpiano> yeah johnbender i knew you were a nogo unfortunately :) i hear ya
[11:24:46] * johnbender is chasing away the crickets
[11:24:49] <ajpiano> was hoping there might be someone in here who didn't already know of the opportunity
[11:26:34] <ajpiano> the organisers aren't being particularly realistic of how if you can't convince someone to fly to korea with 6 weeks notice, it's harder to do it with 2.5 :p
[11:31:21] <uGoMobi> what other kind of talk besides the one RWhitbeck is going to do are they looking for?
[11:31:41] <ajpiano> anything about jQuery Mobile, it seems
[11:32:35] <ajpiano> i think mobile debugging approaches, approaches to dynamic apps with jqm
[11:32:38] <ajpiano> would be useful talks
[11:59:30] <Wilto> woah woah woah ajpiano what are you doing on my turf
[11:59:37] <ajpiano> do you want to box
[11:59:43] <Wilto> DO I EVER.
[11:59:57] * mspisars watching
[12:00:11] * mspisars got popcorn...
[12:00:27] <ajpiano> https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/169411_10100198048466344_685596926_o.jpg
[12:00:33] <Wilto> ajpiano: Lesson #3. Instead of “do you want to box,” experiment with phrases like “YOU WANNA GO, KID!?”
[12:00:48] * mspisars whoa!
[12:01:08] <ajpiano> Sir, is it your intention to goad me into fisticuffs?
[12:01:15] <Wilto> Also good. _Classic_.
[12:01:18] <DaveMethvin> don't worry ajpiano i have your back
[12:01:31] <mspisars> this is fun...
[12:01:37] <DaveMethvin> i shall dispatch this hooligan forthwith
[12:01:43] * mspisars waits for round 2
[12:01:45] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: it's my face i'm worried about
[12:01:57] <DaveMethvin> l o l
[12:02:05] <Wilto> It’s a national treasure.
[12:02:30] <DaveMethvin> it's a good think we don't actually work in the same office, i have a feeling nothing would get done
[12:02:39] <DaveMethvin> thing thing
[12:28:30] <agcolom> ajpiano: hi! I got version 1 of the goelocation of team members done... still very incomplete....
[12:33:24] <ajpiano> hey! yeah i saw the PR!
[12:33:31] <ajpiano> or comment, if you will
[12:33:43] <ajpiano> i can't help the notion that hand curating this info in XML ourselves is not what we'll want to do long term
[12:35:28] <agcolom> yes, but the xml file is really simple... do you think we should have something to populate the xml?
[12:35:36] <ajpiano> but as long as we're able to provide that data in basically the same structure, the view part will work
[12:35:54] <ajpiano> i think the data should be part of some kind of profile on jquery wordpress network basically
[12:36:16] <agcolom> yes, that would probably make sense...
[12:36:52] <ajpiano> then we can theoretically do similar things involving people who aren't on the team, etc, etc.
[12:37:12] <agcolom> I just don't know how to do that part... (I used to use XForms, but XForms are really dead now ;-) )
[12:38:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 2 new commits to tables: http://git.io/cU0yCQ
[12:38:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/tables] set up inputs to toggle their associated table cols - Scott Jehl
[12:38:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/tables] improved column selection, toggling, styles - Scott Jehl
[12:38:34] <ajpiano> i don't see where XForms would come into play
[12:38:58] <ajpiano> ...i also just heard of it for the first time
[12:39:08] <ajpiano> but did some wikipediaing
[12:39:15] <agcolom> long long time ago :-)
[12:39:51] <agcolom> shall I continue to complete the xslt and then we can think about ways to populate the xml?
[12:40:58] <ajpiano> i'm not sure that we'd be populating xml, per se
[12:41:53] <agcolom> so you're happy to create the xml by hand? (I'm happy with that so I don't mind)
[12:42:04] <ajpiano> i don't think there's any xml involved :p
[12:42:12] <agcolom> oh...
[12:42:31] <agcolom> so how would that work?
[12:42:39] <ajpiano> if the data were in wordpress, the data would just be ... in the database
[12:42:52] <agcolom> ok...
[12:42:52] <ajpiano> ostensislby we'd just query for all the users marked as being on the team
[12:43:19] <agcolom> sorry, I'm not a database person...
[12:43:25] <ajpiano> it's ok
[12:43:39] <ajpiano> no expectation that you'd be doing all this :)
[12:43:47] <agcolom> so would the xslt still be useful?
[12:44:29] <ajpiano> i don't necessarily think so
[12:44:34] <ajpiano> would be good to get some of scott_gonzalez's input
[12:44:51] <ajpiano> on how involved he thinks this should be, and where the data ought to live
[12:46:47] <agcolom> yes, that'd be good...
[12:47:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, so behaviours it is?
[12:52:08] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Are you thinking of just using the WordPress users?
[12:52:18] <scott_gonzalez> That seems fine.
[12:52:20] <ajpiano> that's kind of my idea
[12:52:24] <scott_gonzalez> Would prevent duplicating data.
[12:52:28] <ajpiano> exactly
[12:52:34] <ajpiano> we could denote whether people who have accounts are team members
[12:52:47] <ajpiano> and then getting the data for the map viz or whatever is relatively straightforward, i'd presume
[12:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we could probably create a page that would just expose the data as JSON.
[12:53:48] <scott_gonzalez> Or if we wanted we could just query the users via node-wordpress.
[12:54:21] <agcolom> are all team members WordPress users?
[12:55:03] <ajpiano> not yet, but ostensibly they would be
[12:57:11] <_|Nix|_> This behaviours idea makes me think that maybe we can build the custom select the same way.
[12:58:02] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ajpiano: how do we move forward?
[12:59:18] <ajpiano> it depends - if you want to mock out some version of the map stuff using some mock json data, that would allow you to iterate on that
[12:59:46] <agcolom> ajpiano: ok. I think json is easier to play with than xml, so happy to do that...
[12:59:49] <ajpiano> some of the infrastructural things will probably take a bit longer to get into place
[13:00:28] <ajpiano> and then from a wordpress standpoint, the task would be to get https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/blob/master/pages/team.html to be a more programmatically generated thing
[13:00:32] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do you think I can still use xslt for this?
[13:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I don't think we'll be using XSLT for anything other than API sites.
[13:03:01] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, what should we use instead?
[13:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> JSON
[13:06:31] <agcolom> I thought the source was JSON. What is the ouput going to be?
[13:07:30] <agcolom> don't we need to go JSON -> html?
[13:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, HTML
[13:13:39] <agcolom> ok... are we ok to use an address rather than lat/long (I'm thinking it's crazy to store lat/long and address is more useful),
[13:14:41] <agcolom> shame though... I was really proud of my xslt file ;-)
[13:20:07] <agcolom> I think that's it from me for today... have a good afternoon/evening everyone...
[13:21:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/JYOB8A
[13:21:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Merge pull request #5128 from blowsie/patch-3 - Jasper de Groot
[13:26:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes
[13:26:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: though I think as far as the behaviors is concerned it's meant to be functionality that's used in more than one place
[13:27:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: definitely a good idea though
[13:27:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I also wanted to say that I appreciate your patience
[13:27:58] <johnbender> I know I often give you two stories when it comes to "factored code"
[13:28:02] <johnbender> even in this case
[13:28:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The problem with behaviours as they are defined is that they cannot be made optional.
[13:28:16] <johnbender> on the one hand I said "we don't need it" to the common refresh method
[13:28:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It sure looked like we could do away with refresh, until I started doing the second implementation and realized we cannot.
[13:28:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's true, though we can certainly alter it to just extend an object
[13:29:11] <johnbender> be that the prototype or an "instance" of a widget constructor
[13:29:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that might be a good idea
[13:29:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What we could really use is a way to tack on code to the end of _create() ...
[13:29:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah I don't want to get into doing method chaining or any of that other bullshit
[13:29:55] <johnbender> I'm happy to be explicit with method invocations
[13:29:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Instead of adding a method to the widget's prototype, and requiring the widget's buyin to actually call that method during _create.
[13:30:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'd rather it be explicit
[13:30:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Explicit means non-optional.
[13:30:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: not true
[13:30:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If the method is absent, it will throw an error.
[13:30:54] <johnbender> you can check for it's presence
[13:30:56] <_|Nix|_> I'd have to if ( this._handleFormReset ) this._handleFormReset();
[13:31:03] <johnbender> I'm fine with that
[13:31:11] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, but then do we do that for every possible behaviour?
[13:31:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if we get to the point where there are lots of behaviors for each widget
[13:31:38] <johnbender> eg, > 2
[13:31:41] <_|Nix|_> What if third parties want to tack on behaviours? Or do we limit the scope of this mechanism to internals.
[13:31:44] <johnbender> then I'd agree
[13:31:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: limiting the scope
[13:31:51] <_|Nix|_> ?
[13:31:56] <johnbender> this is not an external api in any way
[13:32:03] <johnbender> it's meant for the project to organize code
[13:32:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we actually DONT want people to be able to do things like extend create
[13:32:38] <johnbender> because it means they are less likely to file a bug and allow us to consider it as a feature addition
[13:32:48] <johnbender> though I concede we loose flexibility
[13:32:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: To be honest, I think the inheritance approach is still the cleanest.
[13:32:57] <johnbender> we really want control over that type of stuff
[13:33:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: This is very invasive by comparison.
[13:33:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't want to manage a complex ineheritance heirarchy
[13:33:30] <johnbender> *inheritance
[13:34:00] <johnbender> and the functionality does not constitute something that you would instantiate on it's own
[13:34:20] <johnbender> we'd effectively be subtyping an abstract class  that's not abstract :/
[13:34:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That latter point is why I tried to let it go.
[13:34:36] <johnbender> yah
[13:34:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, we have $.mobile.widget, and, heck, $.Widget, ... but yeah, let's not add more.
[13:35:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah I would content that the mobile widget is a problem itself
[13:35:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think this is passable for now
[13:35:25] <johnbender> and since it's internal we can always alter it later
[13:35:33] <johnbender> the goal is just to keep things DRY
[13:35:42] <johnbender> and get others to do the same
[13:36:52] <_|Nix|_> OK. Explicit extension via behaviours it is then.
[13:37:06] * _|Nix|_ is writing up PR#3 on this topic
[13:37:24] <_|Nix|_> This is cool though, how we go through reviewed iterations.
[13:37:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: again, thanks for tolerating my sometimes inconsistent rules on "factoredness"
[13:37:38] <johnbender> I have little doubt that's annoying :(
[13:38:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Actually no. It's peer review.
[13:38:27] <johnbender> yah, but I'm sure it would be nice if the review had some consistency to it
[13:38:58] <arschmitz> johnbender: nix: reminds me of trying to get something published in a peer reviewed journal.
[13:39:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think you've just complimented the whole project.
[13:39:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: agree x 100
[13:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: You can already do what you want with $.widget( "foo.bar", $.foo.bar, { _create: function() { this._super( "_create" ); this._handleFormReset(); }...
[13:40:51] <arschmitz> yeah for something like jQuery in any of its forms it only makes sense though i think because it has such a massive user base any change needs to be reviewed and considdered very closely.
[13:41:09] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Oh, really? It doesn't merge the two prototypes? I mean, they end up in the same namespace.
[13:41:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: you're seeing the best/worst of it, we're generally not this picky :P
[13:41:39] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Is it not the case that there can be only one $.foo.bar.prototype._create()?
[13:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> There can be only one.
[13:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> But that doesn't mean you can't proxy it.
[13:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> The widget factory does what you wnat.
[13:42:18] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't matter if you use a new name or an existing name.
[13:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> The functionality is the same.
[13:42:26] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, _super() is super-smart, eh?
[13:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yup
[13:42:41] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Nice!
[13:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> It took a lot of thinking to make it work :-)
[13:42:55] <scott_gonzalez> Did you look at http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#allow-redefining-widgets-to-create-extensions ?
[13:43:57] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I have now ...
[13:44:33] <scott_gonzalez> So the old code is what it does under the hoods.
[13:45:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, I guess we don't need to be explicit after all :)
[13:45:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm
[13:45:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Just stuff a _create() in the behaviour definition :)
[13:46:15] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: where would you do the extension
[13:46:16] <johnbender> ?
[13:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> Somewhat related to behaviors, you're able to pass multiple option hashes on it.
[13:46:32] <scott_gonzalez> s/it/init/
[13:46:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: At the end of _create() ...
[13:46:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I mean where would you invoke the snippet that scott pasted
[13:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> elem.widget( { foo: "bar" }, { baz: "qux" }, { moar: "options" } )
[13:47:24] <johnbender> why wouldn't we extend the prototype and avoid doing that on each _create pass?
[13:47:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Inside the behaviour: _create: function() { this._super( "create" ); this._handleFormReset(); }
[13:47:55] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: `this._super( "_create" )` was a typo, should just be `this._super()`
[13:48:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right, where would you invoke $.widget( "mobile.selectmenu", $.mobile.behavior.formReset );
[13:48:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Thanks for correcting me.
[13:49:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, that. Right ...
[13:49:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I gues that part will remain explicit.
[13:49:47] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the issue I have with this _still_
[13:50:01] <johnbender> is that the ordering of the method invocation is dependent on the order of extenions
[13:50:04] <johnbender> *extension
[13:50:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Wait a minute. If we place that code inside the behaviour itself, do we end up with a circular dependency?
[13:50:10] <johnbender> which is crazytown
[13:50:28] <johnbender> I'd still rather see us just extend the prototype and call the method directly in create
[13:50:44] <johnbender> if people _external_ to the project want to method chain on _create they can
[13:50:47] <johnbender> but we shouldn
[13:50:50] <johnbender> shouldn't
[13:52:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, then we can keep that call inside the respective widgets, and if the behaviour is absent, the second parameter to $.widget will be undefined.
[13:53:15] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right, keep in mind we don't have any optional behaviors as yet
[13:53:30] <johnbender> once we do, and it becomes and issue we can address that directly
[13:53:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Or, rather, the third parameter, because it should be $.widget( "mobile.select", $.mobile.select, $.mobile.behavior.formReset );
[13:54:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think it's just $.widget( "mobile.select", $.mobile.behavior.formReset ); ... scott_gonzalez ?
[13:54:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I guess this will make it optional-ready™.
[13:54:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nono, you want the original proto folded in.
[13:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: No, you need to inherit from the existing widget.
[13:55:02] <johnbender> ah
[13:55:10] <johnbender> I thought it checked if the object existed and extended it
[13:55:24] * johnbender stands corrected
[13:55:25] <scott_gonzalez> No, because you can overwrite a widget.
[13:56:41] <_|Nix|_> I'm thinking you can arrive at a fairly complex structure with this mechanism if you're not careful. Would it be a DAG? *scratch head*
[13:57:36] <_|Nix|_> Maybe it'd even allow cycles O_o ... my vision is blurry on this topic.
[14:01:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Shall we inaugurate a directory like js/behaviors?
[14:01:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Currently, I'm putting this in js/widgets/forms/jquery.mobile.behaviors.formReset.js ... kind of a long name.
[14:15:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I would just do it in js/widgets/forms/reset.js
[14:15:17] <johnbender> we can always move it
[14:16:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[15:34:17] <toddmparker> arschmitz: Thanks stomach you all your help in the tracker. It really makes a big difference.
[15:34:34] <AlexSchmitz> no problem
[15:34:34] <toddmparker> You and uGoMobi are the triage superpowers
[15:34:39] <AlexSchmitz> lol
[15:34:50] <AlexSchmitz> i need some help from you i think though
[15:34:53] <toddmparker> I'll get you an awkward spandex suit
[15:35:02] <toddmparker> Ok, what do you need
[15:35:47] <toddmparker> Sorry I was MIA today, super sick. Slept for 18 hours straight.
[15:36:04] <AlexSchmitz> i went a little crazy today and told ajpiano id give a talk on jquery mobile in south korea at jquery asia because he couldnt get any one else
[15:36:18] <toddmparker> Oh, cool
[15:36:27] <toddmparker> In two weeks, eh?
[15:36:36] <AlexSchmitz> yeah lol
[15:36:49] <toddmparker> What do you want to cover?
[15:36:53] <AlexSchmitz> and i need to come up with a 40 minute talk
[15:37:13] <toddmparker> I can send you my default jQuery Mobile talk but its more of an overview
[15:37:25] <AlexSchmitz> i need to see what RWhitbeck: is going to be covering
[15:37:42] <toddmparker> Ah, he's speaking too? Cool
[15:37:48] <AlexSchmitz> yes
[15:39:17] <toddmparker> Once you know his topic, we can strategize
[15:39:28] <AlexSchmitz> Cool
[15:40:33] <AlexSchmitz> oh and do you want me to come up with a demo for the integration with the jquery ui interactions?
[15:41:02] <toddmparker> I think a sortable list using UI would be cool as a demo
[15:41:15] <toddmparker> I really want to make ton of useful demos
[15:41:40] <toddmparker> Nice thing us demos aren't code we need to fully support as we do with the library
[15:42:01] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Been thinking we might even want a separate repo for demos
[15:42:15] <AlexSchmitz> iv got this already a bit much for the docs lol its a widget i made for tablet photo gallerys  http://www.uglymongrel.com/#phototable
[15:43:41] <AlexSchmitz> a sortable list will be easy in comparison lol.
[15:46:20] <AlexSchmitz> if you look at the "grid view" in that widget demo thats a sortable
[15:56:27] <toddmparker> Woah, that is crazy impressive
[15:56:44] <toddmparker> Surprised I never saw that
[15:57:26] <AlexSchmitz> thank you i spent like 3 weeks writing it lol
[15:58:05] <AlexSchmitz> wanted a super flexible gallery that wouldwork with jqm and be flashy
[15:59:24] <AlexSchmitz> the dealerships use it to display all their photos from events with their mascott
[16:01:41] <AlexSchmitz> toddmparker: another demo i thought would be super usefull is a map that uses geolocation api for directions from your current location
[16:02:26] <toddmparker> Cool. Link?
[16:05:06] <AlexSchmitz> http://billdodgeautogroup.com/mobile/directions.php?store=bmw
[16:06:19] <AlexSchmitz> toddmparker:i know you want to come to portland to get a new bmw
[16:06:41] <toddmparker> I do. I really do.
[16:07:03] <AlexSchmitz> thats a really old page that needs updating but it shows the concept its also a smartphone only site normally you couldnt get there with a desktop
[16:08:44] <toddmparker> Nice
[16:09:42] <AlexSchmitz> it can even be set to update so it gives essentially turn by turn
[16:18:27] <toddmparker> Cool. I need to hop off, kids bedtime
[16:21:49] <AlexSchmitz> toddparker: cool hope your feeling better tomorrow!
[17:21:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Re: new repo... I think the downside would be that you can't use them easily to test a branch
[17:22:08] <uGoMobi> besides the demo purpose they will be great for testing
[17:47:47] <AlexSchmitz> uGoMobi: i think personally thats a really good point having all these random demos gives a lot of easy manual tests. and they are real usecases so could expose real problems that might otherwise never be noticed untill it was in the wild.
