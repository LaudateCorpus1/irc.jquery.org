[07:15:03] <toddparker> morning all
[07:18:20] <aaronmcadam> afternoon here :)
[07:44:31] <toddparker> hi aaronmcadam
[07:44:41] <toddparker> miketaylr - you around?
[07:44:54] <toddparker> wondering about this issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2680
[07:44:55] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2680 on jquery-mobile, reported by haydarekarrar (26m, 50s ago): Opera 11.51 Win7: option values not displayed in select menu
[08:05:01] <aaronmcadam> yes
[08:05:05] <aaronmcadam> i told him to file that toddparker
[08:05:27] <aaronmcadam> it's to do with appending options programmatically

[08:22:41] <jqm-jenkins-bot> todd: Fixed typo in code, unnecessary data-role="fieldcontain" attribute. Fixes #2682. Thanks jarrettaylor
[08:52:08] <toddparker> just closed 5 issues with a docs update:

[08:52:10] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by toddparker (2m, 44s ago): Re-vamped the navbar docs to fix incorrect info about icon positioning and theming. Fixes #1858, Fixes #1797, Fixes #2667, Fixes #1180, Fixes #2373The docs incorrectly stated that the icon position could be set perlink, but this is intended as a global setting for the navbar parent.This is working as designed and helps with visual consistency. If iconpositioning n
[08:52:10] <socialhapy> ply the right classes through JS and may need to tweak CSS becausetop/bottom and left/right positions have different heights.
[08:52:11] <toddparker> heh
[08:52:24] <toddparker> i actually closed a few toehrs in addition
[08:52:32] <toddparker> lots of dupes on navbar icon positioning
[08:52:39] <toddparker> just bad docs
[08:53:57] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[08:55:30] <toddparker> i'd like to try and target places like this that have lots of bugs that are easy to fix
[08:55:46] <toddparker> most fixes are just docs improvements to explain what works and what doesn't
[08:56:03] <aaronmcadam> yeah it's inevitable because so many bugs have been fixed
[08:58:25] <toddparker> yeah
[08:58:31] <toddparker> or docs are ancient, like navbar

[09:24:23] <aaronmcadam> toddparker: is there a widget factory for jqm or planned?
[09:27:40] <toddparker> we use the widget factory from jQuery UI for all our plugins
[09:27:55] <toddparker> post-1.0, we're going to upgrade to the newer version they have
[09:29:16] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1579
[09:29:17] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1579 on jquery-mobile, reported by jammus (5m, 6d ago): 'Error loading page' when opening a page specified in appcache manifest (iPhone)
[09:29:20] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[09:29:27] <johnbender> I'm starting to think we can't add a fix for that
[09:30:34] <johnbender> and that folks will have to use the workaround for now should they run into the issue
[09:30:57] <johnbender> I'm just afraid of setting isLocal when its not a local file
[09:48:59] <kinblas> setting phonegap for android is like finding missing puzzle pieces
[10:01:36] <toddparker> guys, I think that's fine
[10:02:08] <toddparker> i'd actually prefer that kin spends and hour or so adding a phone gap page to the docs outlining the basics and some gotchas and we can close a lot of these as won't fix
[10:02:23] <toddparker> we just can't debug every phone gap app that comes in
[10:02:27] <toddparker> it's killing our productivity
[10:02:54] <toddparker> but if we had a page that has some common stuff to consider and tips, we can at least point 'em there and add to it over time
[10:03:02] <toddparker> whatcha think kinblas  and johnbender
[10:03:04] <kinblas> toddparker: I think I missed a chunk of the conversation here
[10:03:18] <kinblas> toddparker: agreed, we need a phonegap page
[10:03:47] <toddparker> np
[10:04:12] <toddparker> i just see a lot of phone gap, manifest issues and they are a huge timesink
[10:04:38] <toddparker> if peole can narrow this down and say "if you tweak X, this fixes the issue" we can consider it
[10:04:42] <kinblas> toddparker: where are those? In the issues list? I've only been seeing failure to do cross-domain stufff
[10:04:46] <toddparker> but debugging is brutal
[10:05:11] <toddparker> woah, github redesign
[10:05:36] <toddparker> for example, this just came in today
[10:05:40] <toddparker> phonegap + android only

[10:07:24] <toddparker> tho this will be covered w/ the docs page notes Ithink
[10:07:57] <toddparker> but not tons of issues, no
[10:09:45] <toddparker> kinblas: this issue about event legginess is closed (maybe by accident?)

[10:09:47] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #142 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1y, 1d ago): Laggy scroll swipe events
[10:09:49] <toddparker> thoughts?
[10:10:27] <toddparker> we have that other issue about laggy scrolling too
[10:10:34] <toddparker> but that is just w/threshold
[10:10:50] <kinblas> you didn't say what platform ;-)
[10:11:04] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm assuming iOS for you?
[10:11:12] <kinblas> that bug was soooooo long ago
[10:11:27] <kinblas> we fixed many perf problems that were contributing to laggy scrolling
[10:11:35] <kinblas> remember how bad scrolling over listviews used to be?
[10:11:40] <toddparker> yeah
[10:11:45] <kinblas> turned out to be our use of live() in button markup
[10:11:46] <toddparker> used to be bad news bears
[10:12:07] <kinblas> live() is convenient but expensive (therefore evil)
[10:12:09] <kinblas> :-)
[10:12:10] <toddparker> my Q is whether these changes really make a diff.
[10:12:26] <toddparker> for example, if you're not using a fixed toolbar on a page, are events still asigned?
[10:12:37] <toddparker> grabbing a bite
[10:12:40] <kinblas> eh?
[10:14:20] <kinblas> toddparker: when you get back was 142 accidentally closed?

[10:22:35] <jqm-jenkins-bot> myakura.web: fix -moz-background-clip value so that old Firefox can understand. Fix for #2677
[10:29:26] <toddparker> kinblas: #142?
[10:30:16] <toddparker> yeah, think so
[10:30:20] <toddparker> i mentioned that
[10:30:23] <toddparker> just re-opened
[10:30:29] <toddparker> is github recycling issues #'s
[10:30:38] <kinblas> toddparker: ok just wanted to know if it was closed by accident
[10:30:45] <kinblas> we really do need to do a perf run through
[10:30:45] <toddparker> 142 is low
[10:30:55] <toddparker> yeah, agreed
[10:31:03] <kinblas> it's hard when there are so few of us at the moment
[10:31:08] <kinblas> and so many issues
[10:31:12] <toddparker> i know
[10:31:40] <toddparker> trying to get mat on as much as possible, but he can't dig into some of the darker corners
[10:32:09] <toddparker> he'll be back tomorrow
[10:33:31] <kinblas> toddparker: so we were shooting for an rc2 for thursday right? I'm not feelin' it. :-) I feel like I've made minimal progress in the last few days
[10:33:46] <kinblas> and wanted to look at some of those footer bugs
[10:33:52] <toddparker> i think it will be better to wait until early/mid next week
[10:34:45] <toddparker> lots on the todo list
[10:34:45] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1&milestone=9
[10:34:53] <toddparker> course we can move some of these out
[10:37:11] <kinblas> toddparker: so iOS5 official is available today
[10:37:16] <toddparker> woo hoo
[10:37:18] <kinblas> did you update your devices already?
[10:37:28] <toddparker> nope
[10:37:28] <kinblas> I'm wondering if we should keep a few 4.x
[10:37:40] <toddparker> i need to wait til november for my upgrade
[10:37:44] <toddparker> on at&t
[10:37:55] <toddparker> sure
[10:38:02] <kinblas> toddparker: do you guys have 1 or 2 ipads?
[10:38:07] <toddparker> my plan is to have my iPhone 4 be for 4.x testing
[10:38:13] <toddparker> 2
[10:38:30] <toddparker> both original
[10:38:30] <kinblas> toddparker: are they both running the same OS?
[10:38:41] <toddparker> 3.2 and 4.x
[10:39:00] <toddparker> could be time to ditch 3.2
[10:39:11] <toddparker> or i can buy a new iPad 2
[10:39:32] <kinblas> yeah I'm thinking adoption rate for 2nd gen up was pretty good for 4.x
[10:39:38] <kinblas> 2nd gen ios devices that is
[10:39:47] <toddparker> yeah
[10:40:00] <toddparker> can the original iPad be updated to 5
[10:40:06] <kinblas> might be time to upgrade old one to 4.x and new one to 5.x
[10:40:19] <kinblas> the new one is an ipad2?
[10:40:37] <toddparker> both our iPads are 1st gen
[10:40:50] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, I just checked my 1st gen is eligible for 5.x
[10:40:56] <kinblas> I'm downloading but not installing
[10:41:01] <toddparker> ah
[10:41:02] <toddparker>  cool
[10:41:08] <toddparker> maybe i'll upgrade
[10:41:45] <kinblas> I'm sooooo tempted to upgrade
[10:41:47] <kinblas> but I only have one ipad
[10:41:53] <kinblas> :-/
[10:52:59] <toddparker> gonna upgrade our 3.2 ipad
[10:53:09] <toddparker> good worst case
[10:53:09] <toddparker> old hardware, newest os
[10:53:32] <kinblas> tbenzige: you going to get a chance to land stuff in github today?
[10:56:10] <toddparker> was just going to ask that
[10:56:11] <kinblas> toddparker: is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2645 something johnbender can fix for us once he "has the keys"?
[10:56:12] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2645 on jquery-mobile, reported by jblas (4d, 22h ago): code.jquery.com index is not being updated
[10:59:38] <tbenzige> toddparker: i cant access TR github https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller
[11:08:32] <kinblas> tbenzige: when you say can't access
[11:08:41] <kinblas> do you mean you can't clone it, or you can't check into it?
[11:09:28] <kinblas> tbenzige: note that it's actually still empty ... you have to init a local repo and then push it
[11:16:04] <tbenzige> i cant do either right now. i think something about our firewall wont let me
[11:17:30] <kinblas> tbenzige: are you vpn'd in to work?
[11:17:40] <kinblas> tbenzige: I usually don't have a problem
[11:18:04] <kinblas> tbenzige: I think that its a public repo so anyone should be able to access it
[11:18:46] <tbenzige> kinblas: yeah but i know we can't ssh on the vpn. does git use ssh?
[11:19:11] <tbenzige> kinblas: im getting a "errno=Operation timed out"
[11:23:22] <kinblas> tbenzige: I don't use ssh, I just use git with https urls
[11:27:47] <tbenzige> kinblas: i sent you a PM
[11:30:05] <toddparker> sorry, on a call
[11:30:15] <toddparker> i think that repo is private for now
[11:30:20] <toddparker> but will be public eventually
[11:39:09] <toddparker> I just added a readme to that repo and things seem to work fine for me
[11:40:04] <tbenzige> and this is what you used for your remote: git://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller?
[11:41:48] <toddparker> yes
[11:41:56] <toddparker> you can try http
[11:42:01] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller
[11:42:10] <toddparker> see http toggle
[11:42:33] <tbenzige> i tried that one also, and that one at least asked for a username and password, but then it gave me a 403
[11:43:56] <tbenzige> "error: The requested URL returned error: 403 while accessing https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/info/refs"
[11:45:03] <toddparker> hmm
[11:45:08] <toddparker> are you on a mac
[11:45:11] <tbenzige> yes
[11:45:20] <toddparker> do you have the github app
[11:45:30] <tbenzige> no because its for 64 macs only
[11:45:41] <toddparker> hmm
[11:45:45] <toddparker> didn't know that
[11:45:47] <tbenzige> 64bit*
[11:45:49] <toddparker> you need an upgrade
[11:46:06] <tbenzige> seriously!
[11:46:14] <toddparker> I just used that because it's drop dead simple so if it didn't work, you'd know if was firewall related
[11:46:26] <toddparker> once you're logged in, you just see all the repos you have access to
[11:46:34] <toddparker> automagic
[11:46:40] <toddparker> is kin in?
[11:46:59] <tbenzige> we're both at home today. i think he's busy
[11:49:42] <toddparker> so does this open in the browser?

[11:55:11] <toddparker> i'd like your back
[11:55:26] <kinblas> toddparker: I'll be on the call
[11:55:37] <kinblas> toddparker: there is an 800 number?
[11:55:41] * kinblas checks the invite
[11:56:03] <tbenzige> toddparker: no that url doesnt work in the browser. is it working for you? i get a 404
[11:56:53] <kinblas> hmmm works for me ... toddparker, do you have to be part of the jquery organization to see it?
[11:57:23] <tbenzige> it says that i am on the jquery github page
[11:57:32] <tbenzige> apart of the orginization
[11:57:46] <kinblas> yeah I see that now
[11:58:43] <kinblas> toddparker: don't know ifyou saw my reply, yes I'll be on the call
[11:59:21] <kinblas> tbenzige: if you are on vpn, try turning it off ... I have no problems accessing stuff via the command line tools
[11:59:41] <kinblas> the fact that you can't see the repository from within the browser is strange ... you are logged in right?
[11:59:55] <kinblas> logged in to github in the browser that is
[12:00:23] <tbenzige> yeah im logged in and i cant see it in the browser
[12:01:00] <johnbender> toddparker: kinblas: I'm planning to join as well, just about to head out to lunch

[12:35:05] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (1m, 44s ago): Dont overwrite $.mobile.browser if it already exists
[12:35:05] <eddiemonge> yes no?
[12:37:45] <toddparker> kinblas, johnbender ^^
[12:40:21] <kinblas> eddiemonge: who is defining $.mobile.browser outside of that file?
[12:41:38] <eddiemonge> no idea but it could be. or it could be called more than once. its a simple check that i don't think has a downside other than 20 bytes of filesize
[12:44:48] <kinblas> eddiemonge: it is a harmless change, but we shouldn't be loading the support.js more than once ... we don't do the same checks for other things we add to .mobile since we assume we are the ones defining our own namespace object
[12:45:42] <eddiemonge> maybe that is a bad assumption
[12:49:25] <kinblas> eddiemonge: what is a bad assumption? That our JS files are going to be included only once?
[12:50:21] <eddiemonge> that other people arent going to add on to the namespace or define it before the files are called and thus have anything they put there overwritten
[12:53:01] <kinblas> eddiemonge: so are you proposing that we should be checking every property within our namespace to see if they are predefined before we add our defaults?
[12:54:44] <eddiemonge> yes
[12:55:03] <eddiemonge> well maybe not every property but every property that is an object
[12:55:20] <johnbender> kinblas: looking
[12:56:26] <kinblas> eddiemonge: that sounds a bit inconsistent to only do it for objects ... is there a particular issue/bug that prompted this? Just curious.
[12:56:53] <johnbender> kinblas: tests are good that last failure is in the ruby
[12:57:13] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah I noticed the Nil references in the error messages
[12:57:28] <kinblas> the reply was more a reassurance to others :-)
[12:57:36] <kinblas> that we're all good
[12:57:36] <johnbender> kk
[12:57:58] <eddiemonge> kinblas: no, i was just going through the code looking for ways to improve it
[13:01:18] <toddparker> kinblas and johnbender - dialing in to BB call?
[13:02:02] <kinblas> eddiemonge: hey, sorry if it sounds like I'm giving you a hard time ... the thing that is going through my head is this ... folks are concerned about library size, taking on changes that are for things that should really not happen, but add to the size of the file should be flagged
[13:02:25] <kinblas> or justified I should have said
[13:02:30] <kinblas> hence my questions
[13:02:38] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm on the call already
[13:02:53] <kinblas> listening to their music
[13:03:42] <johnbender> kinblas: same here
[13:05:12] <toddparker> me too
[13:05:14] <toddparker> gah
[13:05:20] <toddparker> very relaxing
[13:05:42] <toddparker> like this new song
[13:05:49] <toddparker> very futuristical
[13:05:54] <eddiemonge> kinblas: file size shouldnt matter if good coding standards are followed. it could be made up in other places as im finding
[13:06:32] <toddparker> do you guys have any Q's for RIM?
[13:07:08] <toddparker> i don't have much
[13:07:22] <toddparker> this is your chance to ask the browser guys
[13:07:43] <eddiemonge> is there a way to have the browser keep a playbook on? like for pandora?
[13:20:16] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!

[13:24:22] <kinblas> toddparker: yes
[13:25:32] <tbenzige> toddparker: i finally committed my files to the TR repo. i'm not sure why it wasn't working before but its working now
[13:26:37] <eddiemonge> what is "element" here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.page.js#L21
[13:30:03] <johnbender> toddparker: kinblas: see my private messages please :D
[14:02:30] <toddparker> ok so danheberden fixed up the TR repo permissions
[14:02:41] <toddparker> tbenzige was able to get his code in
[14:02:59] <tbenzige> toddparker: i left out the kuler plugin
[14:03:23] <tbenzige> there is a kuler-api key involved so anyone who forks the repo would find it in my php script
[14:14:52] <johnbender> tbenzige: if you can load it externally generally people just put it in the .gitignore and include a whatever.sample file with "INSERT KEY HERE"
[14:16:13] <toddparker> so if we set up a script that deploys from git to jquerymobile.com, do we just need to replace that with the key somehow?
[14:16:39] <johnbender> toddparker: yes
[14:16:43] <johnbender> the key will live on the server
[14:16:49] <johnbender> your initial deploy must include teh key
[14:16:51] <johnbender> *the
[14:16:53] <toddparker> i agree with johnbender that i'd like all the code in the repo (except your key or other sensitive info)
[14:17:03] <toddparker> ah
[14:17:17] <toddparker> so the key can be not eh server and ally eh rest of the files come from the repo
[14:17:25] <johnbender> toddparker: can we pester ray bango over at MS for something similar to what we just had with bb
[14:17:28] <toddparker> i need to ask dan about that next step
[14:17:29] <johnbender> especially for test devices
[14:17:39] <toddparker> tbenzige: what's the dev status at this point?
[14:17:41] <johnbender> toddparker: yah I have access to the servers now
[14:17:48] <johnbender> so if you want to chat about that
[14:17:48] <toddparker> you do? cool
[14:18:03] <johnbender> toddparker: well he said he has my key
[14:18:07] <johnbender> so I assume that means I do
[14:18:11] <johnbender> but I don't know where it is
[14:18:16] <toddparker> have you tried to access the server?
[14:18:17] <johnbender> or what it looks like
[14:18:20] <johnbender> standards etc
[14:18:22] <johnbender> nope
[14:18:42] <toddparker> ok
[14:18:51] <toddparker> dan is away right now, but i can ask tomorrow
[14:19:20] <johnbender> awesome
[14:22:54] <toddparker> i just closed this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2676
[14:22:55] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2676 on jquery-mobile, reported by frequent (14h, 28m ago): feature request: class for pages loaded into existing DOM via Ajax
[14:23:09] <johnbender> tbenzige: was my suggestion clear from my description?
[14:23:09] <toddparker> but i wonder if we can improve stuff like this post-1.0
[14:23:21] <johnbender> not sure if it makes sense for you but thats the standard way to approach keys in public repos
[14:23:35] <toddparker> tow big restrictions: you can't pull in a multi-page and you can link to anchors within the content
[14:24:11] <johnbender> toddparker: we already have a data attribute for pages loaded into the dom frmo ajax
[14:24:15] <johnbender> data-external
[14:24:23] <johnbender> its not documented because it was for internal use
[14:24:44] <toddparker> that data tattar is added tot he page wrappers win ajax'd in?
[14:24:48] <toddparker> ah
[14:25:00] <johnbender> toddparker: let me double check though
[14:25:04] <johnbender> I added it
[14:25:46] <johnbender> toddparker: data-external page
[14:25:59] <johnbender> we need to guarantee that the pages being reaped weren't embedded
[14:26:10] <johnbender> agh!
[14:26:14] <toddparker> data-external OR data-external-page
[14:26:16] <johnbender> toddparker: data-external-page="true"
[14:26:27] <toddparker> rokk
[14:26:35] <toddparker> still don't know how this would solve his issue
[14:27:14] <toddparker> oh, so in the future, what if I could link to a multipage like this
[14:27:24] <toddparker> multipage.html#page3
[14:27:27] <johnbender> toddparker: I just read the description lol
[14:27:30] <johnbender> I'll read the link
[14:27:53] <toddparker> this would pull in ALL page containers if finds int eh doc and changePage to page3
[14:32:53] <johnbender> kinblas will have to chime in here but one of the primary issues is that its ambigious where the second page is relative to at that point, is it relative to the page it was loaded on or relative to the original document
[14:32:57] <johnbender> or at least in my mind
[14:33:32] <toddparker> could we treat a multipage sort of like a bulk data-preload
[14:34:11] <toddparker> johnbender: when you ask about relative, do you mean for base tag normalization
[14:34:44] <toddparker> just sort of seems fixable with some thing
[14:35:20] <toddparker> on the anchors, it would be cool if I could link to an actor, like old skool HTML
[14:35:24] <johnbender> more with regards to navigation
[14:35:26] <toddparker> it's one thing we really broke
[14:35:44] <johnbender> we know where the link/srcs have to be relative too since they were defined on the server
[14:35:49] <toddparker> right
[14:36:06] <johnbender> but when the element is in the page
[14:36:10] <toddparker> but all the pages are sort of link sibling, link-wise
[14:36:22] <toddparker> sure i'm oversimplifying
[14:36:26] <johnbender> is that relative to the page that it was loaded as a part of or the document into which it is now embedded
[14:36:48] <johnbender> toddparker: so we'd have to then handle that in the data url right
[14:36:54] <toddparker> yeah
[14:36:54] <johnbender> /foo/bar.html loads 2 divs
[14:37:01] <johnbender> it adds a lot of complexity
[14:37:15] <johnbender> I'm not saying we can't do it only that its not really necessary
[14:37:16] <toddparker> yeah, seeing that
[14:37:19] <johnbender> first and foremost
[14:37:30] <johnbender> small return on the effort I guess
[14:37:45] * kinblas begins chiming
[14:38:12] <johnbender> if you're a rest adherent too this isn't an issue
[14:38:17] <toddparker> i agree it's not super common
[14:38:20] <kinblas> support for hashes in external pages is possible ... but ... it does introduce an extra level of complexity equivalent to the first-page of the document
[14:38:21] <toddparker> that's why we punted
[14:38:23] <johnbender> since it would be odd to have two pages for the same resource
[14:38:36] <johnbender> toddparker: yah
[14:38:37] <toddparker> right
[14:39:08] <toddparker> i wonder if anchor linking would be more valuable if we tackle anything
[14:39:24] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2637#issuecomment-2318733
[14:39:25] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2637 on jquery-mobile, reported by leopd (5d, 14h ago): Basic navigation broken on AJAX-loaded pages
[14:39:25] <kinblas> anything?
[14:39:44] <johnbender> also I'm tempted to not add the feature just so that guy uses Sencha :(
[14:39:56] <toddparker> heh
[14:40:05] <toddparker> these tickets were what got me thinking
[14:40:26] <toddparker> if this one thing is too hard, good luck with sencha
[14:41:29] <toddparker> ah, what about this
[14:41:51] <toddparker> how hard would i be to look at a page being pulled int o see if there is >1 page wrapper
[14:42:01] <toddparker> never mind
[14:42:03] <toddparker> bad idea
[14:42:15] <toddparker> was going to say we could force a reload if they try to do this
[14:42:27] <toddparker> but it would require 2 loads. microsoft would be happy.
[14:42:28] <johnbender> yah too much assumption
[14:42:31] <johnbender> hahah
[14:42:42] <toddparker> can't believe i just suggested...
[14:42:43] <kinblas> lol
[14:43:01] <johnbender> toddparker: which reminds me do we have contacts at MS
[14:43:21] <toddparker> ok, what if we detected >1 page wrapper and if so, throw up a error message saying "hey only one pulled in"
[14:43:28] <toddparker> that would ake 'em fix their setup
[14:43:38] <toddparker> yeah, i *just* got a name today
[14:44:33] <toddparker> just forwarded a message i sent
[14:44:41] <toddparker> no word back yet
[14:47:10] <johnbender> cool
[14:47:42] <johnbender> toddparker: I like explosions in API, loud ones
[14:47:45] <toddparker> kinblas: I know you're looking at a bunch of stuff, but if you have a bit of time to look at fixed footers, we can close a zillion bugs :)
[14:47:49] <johnbender> but it's not an api failure
[14:47:51] <johnbender> bad pr
[14:47:58] <toddparker> heh
[14:48:09] <toddparker> or maybe bender can take a peek...
[14:49:14] <johnbender> toddparker: does that issue have a list of issues?
[14:49:18] <kinblas> toddparker: I know, I know
[14:49:19] <johnbender> I'd enjoy taking a look
[14:49:34] <toddparker> eddie
[14:50:23] <johnbender> toddparker: do you have issues in front of you to assign?
[14:50:47] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/search?q=fixed+footer
[14:51:09] <toddparker> sort of kidding
[14:51:17] <toddparker> I tagged a bunch to kin for RC2
[14:51:18] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1&milestone=9
[14:51:26] <toddparker> just to keep' em in mind
[14:51:45] <toddparker> basically, lots of events don't trigger the fixed toolbars to re-position
[14:52:00] <toddparker> I think we need need to expose a re-position method if one doesn't exist
[14:52:13] <toddparker> so people can call it manually
[14:52:43] <johnbender> toddparker: and dogfood it ourselves
[14:52:46] <toddparker> the issue is that we want to have decoupeld widgets but a ton of thing alike search filters, collapsibles, etc. cause the height to change which messed up fixed toolbar
[14:52:52] <toddparker> ya
[14:53:03] <toddparker> so what's an elegant way to do this
[14:53:16] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll need to think
[14:53:24] <toddparker> it's one of the most obviously busted things
[14:53:25] <johnbender> we might have to watch for resize etc
[14:53:33] * johnbender cringes
[14:53:34] <toddparker> and I think some scenarios are fixable
[14:53:37] <johnbender> but I need to think
[14:53:40] <toddparker> yeah
[14:53:51] <toddparker> just think this would be a good, high profile improvement
[14:53:58] <johnbender> toddparker: is there one I should focus on?
[14:54:06] <toddparker> i know that when scrolling, the DOM is frozen so that may not be fixable
[14:54:11] <kinblas> I think we already look for resize
[14:54:15] <kinblas> and orientation change
[14:54:19] <johnbender> kinblas: sigh
[14:54:19] <kinblas> that's the problem on Android/iOS
[14:54:22] <kinblas> when the keyboard goes up
[14:54:26] <toddparker> it's more of the widget interactions breaking it that are more fixable
[14:54:27] <kinblas> the viewport is resized
[14:54:36] <kinblas> so the headers/footers shift
[14:54:41] <toddparker> *&*(&(*& Android
[14:54:46] <kinblas> ... also a big pain when zoom is enabled
[14:54:54] <toddparker> could we hdd footers on form element focus?
[14:54:59] <toddparker> gross, i know
[14:55:00] <kinblas> because you get "big-honkin-headers-footers"
[14:55:13] <toddparker> course if you have an input in a fotter
[14:55:20] <toddparker> footer
[14:55:23] <toddparker> not fotter
[14:55:23] <johnbender> and position fixed is just a complete shit show?
[14:55:24] <kinblas> heh
[14:55:29] <toddparker> yeah
[14:55:32] <kinblas> it's fodder for footers
[14:55:37] <toddparker> it works in a handful of places
[14:56:13] <toddparker> i'd personally rather add in a want o add in a scroller polyfill that piggybacks not he iOS5 enhancements
[14:56:29] <toddparker> so you could pop in our scroller or scroll as a polyfill
[14:56:37] <toddparker> and get better transitions and fixed bars
[14:56:52] <toddparker> same layout mechanism to maintain
[14:57:03] <toddparker> good one for kin to tinker with
[14:57:34] <toddparker> adding is it easy, targeting it is hard
[14:57:52] <toddparker> but that seems like a good way forward IMHO
[14:58:22] <toddparker> i gotta run!
[14:59:17] <toddparker> one last idea (sorry)
[14:59:26] <toddparker> for elements that we wrap, like buttons and inputs
[14:59:43] <toddparker> should we add an id to the wrapper for styling?
[14:59:56] <toddparker> like if I have a button with an id of foo
[15:00:19] <toddparker> the wrapper gets an id of foo-wrapper or whatever
[15:00:33] <toddparker> sort of hard to style again things that are wrapped
[15:00:50] <johnbender> I think its dangerous to assume that the ID will not be used
[15:00:55] <johnbender> leading to subtle bugs
[15:01:00] <toddparker> not be used?
[15:01:03] <johnbender> I know we already do it some places eh?
[15:01:12] <johnbender> toddparker: foo-wrapper
[15:01:22] <johnbender> there may already be a id=foo-wrapper element
[15:01:25] <toddparker> yeah, it could be used for styling or scripting
[15:01:36] <toddparker> we'd need to ensure it was unique enough
[15:01:41] <toddparker> but seems helpful
[15:01:58] <toddparker> just a thought
[15:02:03] <toddparker> ok, gotta jet
[15:02:07] <johnbender> toddparker: kk
[15:03:23] <kinblas> toddparker: regarding the id on wrapped elements ... yes!!! that was one of the main things I mentioned back in Oct 2010
[15:03:26] <toddparker> kinblas: can that issue you just commented on be closed then?
[15:03:28] <kinblas> when I was doing the Citrus site

[15:03:38] <toddparker> sorry, yeah?
[15:03:41] <toddparker> citrus
[15:03:48] <kinblas> toddparker: I guess, I hate it when I can't repro but they are obviously seeing something.
[15:04:03] <toddparker> yeah, but i feel like you've been very helpful
[15:04:08] <toddparker> above an beyond
[15:04:15] <johnbender> kinblas: but if manufacture an ID we run the risk of railroading other, user identified, elements in the page eh?
[15:04:34] <toddparker> meaning if we had an id collision
[15:04:43] <johnbender> toddparker: yes
[15:04:48] <toddparker> sure, sure
[15:05:02] * johnbender is being a devil's advocate
[15:05:16] <kinblas> johnbender: eh, but we can use a prefix/suffix that is unlikely
[15:05:25] <johnbender> *the* devils advocat, I don't want to think about many possible devils
[15:05:30] <johnbender> kinblas: true
[15:05:38] <kinblas> <my_id>-ui-btn
[15:05:42] <kinblas> or whatever
[15:05:47] <toddparker> for example
[15:05:50] <johnbender> mobile.ns!
[15:05:50] <toddparker> i have this
[15:05:52] <toddparker> <input type="button" value="Input type=button" class="ui-btn-hidden" aria-disabled="false">
[15:06:10] <toddparker> which is wrapped into this
[15:06:12] <toddparker> <div data-theme="c" class="ui-btn ui-btn-corner-all ui-shadow ui-btn-down-c ui-btn-up-c" aria-disabled="false"><span class="ui-btn-inner ui-btn-corner-all" aria-hidden="true"><span class="ui-btn-text">Input type=button</span></span><input type="button" value="Input type=button" class="ui-btn-hidden" aria-disabled="false"></div>
[15:06:13] <johnbender> whoa your value is "Input type=button"
[15:06:38] * johnbender john's head explodes
[15:06:47] <toddparker> woah, it's int eh markup
[15:06:51] <toddparker> i'll fix now
[15:06:54] <kinblas> it's just a value :-P
[15:06:55] <toddparker> WTH
[15:07:00] <toddparker> i know, but...

[15:09:36] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by toddparker (44.948s ago): Tweaked odd input values in demo page for buttons
[15:09:57] <toddparker> soooo anyway, the wrapper on that is useless for styling
[15:10:09] <toddparker> it's got a lot of classes, but nothing unique
[15:10:23] <toddparker> how would you write a style against that?
[15:11:06] <toddparker> so i think if an ID is there and we wrap, we could generate something unique-ish on the wrap
[15:11:10] <toddparker> for an ID
[15:11:15] <toddparker> even if it's long
[15:11:24] <kinblas> toddparker: you can't without factoring in position, or affecting others with a class property change
