[07:15:49] <Wilto> ‘Morning, guys.
[07:21:40] <aaronmcadam> hiya Wilto
[08:04:52] <Wilto> Hey, quick vote: I’m adding a class so that things can be hidden in an accessible way—I’m thinking of labels specifically, since users are just leaving them out completely right now.
[08:05:44] <Wilto> Everyone okay with something like “.a11y-only { position: absolute; left: -9999px; }”?
[08:17:53] <toddparker> sounds good to me
[08:20:23] <jzaefferer> Wilto: in UI we have this
[08:20:24] <jzaefferer> .ui-helper-hidden-accessible { position: absolute !important; clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); clip: rect(1px,1px,1px,1px); }
[08:20:42] <jzaefferer> I'm pretty sure there was a ton of discussion around that...
[08:21:00] <Wilto> Uh oh.
[08:21:29] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #130: FAILURE in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/130/
[08:21:29] <jqm-jenkins-bot> todd: Refined styles so titles in footer aren't truncated as aggressively
[08:21:32] <toddparker> good one jzaefferer
[08:21:44] <Wilto> “Ton of discussion,” you say.
[08:21:51] <toddparker> that minus the "helper" seems clear
[08:24:12] <Wilto> Seconded.
[08:24:22] <jzaefferer> my guess is: it has flaws, but is the best we could come up with
[08:24:33] <jzaefferer> there's problably some discussion somewhere on bugs.jqueryui.com
[08:25:05] <Wilto> Ehh, I’m just gonna push forward with it. We need something for this—we can refine later.
[08:25:13] <jzaefferer> btw. whats the motivation here anyway? a VoicerOver user won't be able to find that element, right?
[08:25:41] <Wilto> Users are omitting the labels completely, which at worst is breaking stuff and at least sucks for accessibility.
[08:26:01] <Wilto> So we want to provide a way to hide them visually while keeping them in the flow of the document.
[08:29:07] <Wilto> And we could “fix” it so they can leave labels out without breaking stuff, but… I kind of like that we’re foisting more accessible markup on them.
[08:30:40] <jzaefferer> okay, sounds reasonable
[08:32:41] <Wilto> I don’t often get accused of being reasonable—it’s kinda nice.
[08:51:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: toddparker: scottjehl: I'll be back online in a bit
[08:51:54] <johnbender> heading into work now
[09:18:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!

[10:23:19] <johnbender> toddparker: toddmparker_ https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2546#issuecomment-2409069
[10:23:19] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2546 on jquery-mobile, reported by laustdeleuran (2w, 2d ago): jQuery Mobile Ajax navigation makes it impossible to use offline applicationCache.
[10:23:31] <johnbender> I also asked that he post to the issue list before posting to his blog
[12:01:25] <toddparker> hi all
[13:07:56] <johnbender> toddparker: quiet today
[13:17:45] <johnbender> toddparker: did you see the pull request from eddiemonge
[13:17:59] <johnbender> he was thinking of rejiggering our file structure for the css in light of the stucture/theme changes
[13:18:04] <johnbender> I wanted to leave that up to you
[13:18:09] <johnbender> but otherwise the build stuff is done
[13:18:23] <johnbender> dunno about getting it onto the cdn though
[13:19:51] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #133: SUCCESS in 12 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/133/
[13:19:52] <jqm-jenkins-bot> todd: Re-vamped form docs to add in full width examples and clean up demos
[13:23:47] <Wilto> Thinking about updating every page of the docs to say “just read the source code.” You guys cool with that?
[13:24:33] <toddparker> johnbender: i was debating that
[13:24:38] <toddparker> the re-org
[13:24:44] <toddparker> i don't think it's a bad idea
[13:24:56] <toddparker> just wondering what the impact of that may be
[13:25:17] <toddparker> but having a css folder for structure and themes makes sense to me
[13:25:27] <toddparker> john
[13:25:43] <toddparker> johnbender: mat and i have been cranking away at form stuff and docs
[13:25:46] <toddparker> clean up time
[13:25:58] <toddparker> haven't seen kin
[13:26:15] <toddparker> oh, johnbender I was wondering if you had a chance to fix up the disabling of form elements
[13:26:28] <toddparker> that should be fixed up as a priority. sort of basic
[13:26:35] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll focus on that
[13:26:42] <johnbender> just finished noodling on that degrade inputs issue
[13:29:18] <johnbender> toddparker: I think the worste of those appears to be slider
[13:30:23] <Wilto> Anything I could help with?
[13:35:03] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2541
[13:35:04] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2541 on jquery-mobile, reported by johnbender (2w, 3d ago): Some form elements don't behave properly when disabled
[13:35:19] <johnbender> if you want to take a look at the select menu text color
[13:35:32] <johnbender> and the button lowlighting
[13:41:07] <Wilto> Sure thing.

[14:17:59] <Wilto> ?boom
[14:18:00] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[14:18:48] <eddiemonge> johnbender: toddparker any feedback on my pull req?
[14:24:48] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I told toddparker and he said he liked the idea at least
[14:24:54] <johnbender> thats because its a good idea!
[14:26:56] <eddiemonge> Is it good or does it need more work?
[14:27:30] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I think he wanted to double check the impact
[14:27:38] <johnbender> we're just getting so close to 1.0
[14:33:04] <eddiemonge> Yeah
[14:33:17] <eddiemonge> This month right?
[14:33:39] <eddiemonge> Would this be a change to make it in so tr irks?
[14:33:47] <eddiemonge> Works
[14:41:27] <johnbender> eddiemonge: well in theory the changes I pushed yesterday would put us in fine shape for theme roller
[14:41:38] <johnbender> not sure if that's what you meant
[14:41:47] <johnbender> Wilto: you solved both issues I think we can close that bug
[14:42:44] <Wilto> Happy to be of service.
[14:55:14] <johnbender> git pull https://github.com/redaemn/jquery-mobile.git Issue-#2654
[14:55:17] <johnbender> ugh

[15:11:24] <toddparker> we got a lot of good form stuff cleaned up today
[15:14:31] <eddiemonge> toddparker: Any thoughts on my CSS pull?
[15:16:00] <toddparker> i think it makes sense for sure
[15:16:13] <toddparker> i was just asking bender if there would be ripples we should think about
[15:16:23] <toddparker> we definitely need to update every page in the docs
[15:16:35] <johnbender> toddparker: "i goth head our johnbender" ?
[15:16:37] <johnbender> I'm confused
[15:16:40] <toddparker> and we've been making a bunch of changes in the last day or so
[15:16:42] <eddiemonge> Did that
[15:16:44] <toddparker> heh
[15:16:49] <toddparker> i gotta head out johnbender
[15:16:53] <toddparker> goth
[15:16:54] <johnbender> toddparker: cool
[15:16:54] <eddiemonge> It would mostly be merging the changes
[15:16:58] <toddparker> yeah
[15:17:28] <toddparker> if you can double check everything and make sure the pull will go cleanly, we can do this on monday
[15:17:41] <toddparker> don't want to pull, then leave in case we break soemthing
[15:17:53] <toddparker> i appreciate the help
[15:18:03] <toddparker> talk to you guys later!
[15:18:13] <eddiemonge> Monday then

[15:23:19] <kinblas> I thought I was logged in this entire time

[15:23:34] <kinblas> cause it was showing folks in the channel pane
[15:23:51] <kinblas> thought it was a little too silent, so I sent a test
