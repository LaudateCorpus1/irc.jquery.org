[06:48:25] <DaveMethvin> anyone here have an android 2.1 device?  We're trying to see if we fixed a bug there
[06:48:36] <DaveMethvin> jsfiddle links are in this ticket http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12370
[07:08:35] <Wilto> Why are we dammit-ing Wilto NOW?
[07:08:44] <Wilto> DaveMethvin: I can have a look.
[07:11:53] <DaveMethvin> Wilto: much obliged!
[07:12:06] <Wilto> DaveMethvin: “works with 1.7.2 -  http://jsbin.com/aqevig/2/edit but not 1.8.0 -  http://jsbin.com/aqevig/1”
[07:12:19] <DaveMethvin> aaarrrrgh
[07:12:21] <Wilto> Checking the latter of the two links, I’m guessing?
[07:12:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:12:30] <DaveMethvin> oh but try jquery-git
[07:12:38] <DaveMethvin> that's the one i hope we fixed
[07:14:54] <Wilto> http://jsbin.com/aqevig/3
[07:14:56] <Wilto> Please hold.
[07:21:21] <Wilto> DaveMethvin: Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but…
[07:21:23] <Wilto> Nada.
[07:21:43] <DaveMethvin> oh Wilto
[07:21:48] <DaveMethvin> it's sad, but not your fault
[07:21:51] <DaveMethvin> darn
[07:21:54] <Wilto> I blame myself. I do.
[07:21:57] <DaveMethvin> lol
[07:22:00] <Wilto> Ha ha, no, I BLAME ANDROID.
[07:22:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah let's blame the green guy
[07:22:40] <Wilto> If Android had a face, I would punch it.
[08:36:50] <Wilto> So, I have no idea how to deal with this Android Chrome animation/“z-index” issue.
[08:38:44] <johnbender> Wilto: that makes two of us :D
[08:39:00] <Wilto> You took a stab at it too?
[08:39:15] <johnbender> Wilto: no, but that doesn't invalidate my statement :P
[08:39:20] <Wilto> +1
[08:39:30] <johnbender> Wilto: sorry, poor taste
[08:39:40] <Wilto> Man, that’s the only kinda taste I know.
[08:40:46] <Wilto> We’ve sped by “fixes” and just passed “hacks,” and are now well into “work-arounds.”
[08:40:55] <Wilto> Any ideas?
[08:41:14] <Wilto> Fade-animating both or neither element fixes it.
[08:41:56] <Wilto> All the other transitions were fine.
[08:42:02] <Wilto> —oh ho
[08:42:13] <Wilto> What if I added a null animation to the dialog itself.
[08:42:43] <Wilto> from `opacity: 1` to `opacity: 1`. Or like `opacity: .99` to `opacity: 1`.
[08:43:39] <Wilto> Why did I not think of this sooner.
[09:20:33] <johnbender> Wilto: toddparker: disabling history works brilliantly on wp7
[09:20:40] <johnbender> just writting the tests for it now

[09:30:01] <Wilto> johnbender: I have solved the z-index-ish problem in Android Chrome.
[09:30:09] <Wilto> Let me begin by saying that I am not a proud man.
[09:30:29] <Wilto> @-webkit-keyframes popup-workaround { from { opacity: 1; } to { opacity: 1; } }
[09:30:29] <Wilto> .ui-popup-active {
[09:30:29] <Wilto> 	-webkit-animation-name: popup-workaround;
[09:30:29] <Wilto> 	-webkit-animation-fill-mode: forwards;
[09:30:29] <Wilto> 	-webkit-animation-duration: .001s;
[09:30:29] <Wilto> }
[09:30:37] <johnbender> Wilto: nice
[09:30:45] <Wilto> …I got nothin’ else.
[09:30:58] <Wilto> I hate this solution.
[09:31:46] <Wilto> I’d really rather fade in both when the fade transition is selected, but we all know how it goes when you have two simultaneous animations.

[10:21:27] <toddparker> hi all
[10:21:36] <toddparker> i was in UI instead of there :)
[10:21:49] <toddparker> so we should re-group on where we are with popup stuffs
[10:21:55] <toddparker> also seems like we have an issue with fixed toolbars and android with popups. super.

[10:22:05] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4874#issuecomment-8050741
[10:22:14] <toddparker> anyone have time to give these a look?
[10:26:03] <uGoMobi> hi toddparker
[10:30:09] <Wilto> holy hell would I ever love an issue that involves position: fixed
[10:30:12] <uGoMobi> looking at those issues
[10:30:47] <Wilto> uGoMobi: No worries; I got it.
[10:30:52] <Wilto> I think it’s related to something I’m working on now.
[10:32:00] <uGoMobi> Wilto cool
[10:32:15] <uGoMobi> just see your work around ^^
[10:32:24] <Wilto> gross gross gross
[10:32:26] <Wilto> I hate it. I do.
[10:32:38] <Wilto> I think I’m decided on nuking the default fade transition.
[10:32:42] <Wilto> Todd as well.
[10:51:53] <toddparker> my thought is that the overlay is the whole window so it's potentially huge
[10:51:57] <toddparker> animating that is slow
[10:52:11] <toddparker> on an iPad, there is bad tiling on the overlay as it draws it
[10:52:27] <toddparker> my #1 priority for anything really: speed and responsiveness
[10:52:40] <toddparker> so if nixing the fade speed this up, I want to do that
[10:53:00] <toddparker> who knows, could help with the position fixed oddness too
[11:02:20] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: question
[11:02:38] <johnbender> it looks like it animates the popup and the screen separately
[11:02:49] <johnbender> is that intended/necessary?
[11:03:27] <johnbender> toddparker: also, have we tried shrinking the size of the screen overlay and then expanding it to fit the dom after the animation is complete?
[11:57:53] <johnbender> Wilto: toddparker: are my irc messages falling into a black whole somewhere on the internet?
[11:58:02] <Wilto> nobody answer him shh
[11:58:46] <Wilto> johnbender: Todd is off in Meetingtowne for the remainder of the day.
[11:59:01] <Wilto> I was heavily focused on a burrito, me.
[12:06:31] <johnbender> Wilto: lol nice
[12:06:44] <johnbender> Wilto: did you see my question?
[12:11:14] <johnbender> toddparker: POUNCE
[12:12:27] <Wilto> False alarm; I was restarting the router.
[12:12:58] <Wilto> johnbender: “also, have we tried shrinking the size of the screen overlay and then expanding it to fit the dom after the animation is complete?”
[12:16:20] <johnbender> Wilto: yes
[12:16:29] <johnbender> and the more important question
[12:16:44] <johnbender> Wilto: are you aware that the screen and the popup itself animate separately
[12:16:47] <johnbender> ?
[12:16:49] <Wilto> I am.
[12:16:53] <Wilto> And I have no idea, man.
[12:16:56] <johnbender> and if you are is there a reason for that?
[12:17:01] <Wilto> Well, they’re siblings in the DOM.
[12:17:17] <johnbender> shouldn't one be a child of the other?
[12:19:00] <Wilto> Weeeeeell…
[12:19:06] <Wilto> I was thinking about this.
[12:19:17] <Wilto> Siblings makes sense if we go with the single-overlay approach.
[12:19:53] <Wilto> The popup as a child of the overlay would make sense if they each have their own overlay, but that seems kinda clunky anyway.
[12:51:18] <Wilto> So, screen overlay size: you’re thinking we just have it fill the viewport, animate it, then expand it to fill the page.
[12:54:56] <Wilto> That is a hell of a lot smoother on iOS.

[13:38:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Popup: fixed the order of the tolerance parameters. Fixes #4856 - Popup tolerance parameters in different order than documentation. - Jasper de Groot
[13:38:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Tests: fixed popup tolerance test. - Jasper de Groot
[13:42:58] <Wilto> bleh
[13:43:09] <Wilto> johnbender: Changing the height after the fact causes a visible redraw in iOS.
[13:46:41] <Wilto> Nah, this isn’t gonna work.
[13:47:51] <johnbender> Wilto: you could do a single overlay for multiple popups you would just have to insert the popup into the overlay
[13:48:09] <Wilto> Yeah. Hm.
[13:48:15] <johnbender> Wilto: I would also cite the fact that we're aiming for good now
[13:48:28] <johnbender> not good in the future where we might possibly use many popups with a single overlay
[13:48:41] <johnbender> Wilto: if it makes the animation way faster it would be better
[13:49:11] <Wilto> Oh, no diggity and/or doubt.
[13:50:36] <Wilto> I am again reminded of http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2011Aug/0390.html with regards to this Android thing.
[13:50:55] <Wilto> I blame whomever closed that bug.
[14:16:40] <Wilto> Okay. Let’s be real, here.
[14:16:52] <Wilto> No one is actually using the internet on a *phone*.
[14:17:00] <Wilto> That would be ridiculous.
