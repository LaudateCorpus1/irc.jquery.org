[00:34:02] <agcolom> johnbender: sorry I didn't realise you were chairing the meeting yesterday. I told todd and gave him some update... Will email you the details. I will be off for the 2 next meetings as well (evening with my parents on 23rd and no internet from 25th to 4th)
[00:53:58] <agcolom> johnbender: gseguin: where we have trigger (as opposed to _trigger) what prefix do we use for event type? (for example collapsible uses trigger, so I guess <event name="create" type="collapsiblecreate"> is incorrect. what should the type be? thank you!
[01:01:54] <_|Nix|_> Insaaaaaaane! If I attach to the body and stretch the screen by hand to 0, 0, 100%, 100%, I get the hangage!
[01:25:29] <_|Nix|_> Wait, it gets better. If the coordinates are 10px, 10px, 100% - 20px, 100% - 20px, it works fiiiiiiiiiiiine!
[01:25:42] <_|Nix|_> *head = bullet;
[01:39:11] * _|Nix|_ cackles maniacally ... "Insane!" ... "Insane, I tells ya, insaaaaaane!"
[01:39:53] * _|Nix|_ cries like a baby ... 
[01:47:39] <_|Nix|_> OK ... it seems the hangage is triggered if the screen covers the entire page. If I leave out a row of pixels at, say, the bottom of the page, it's fine.
[01:47:54] <_|Nix|_> I wonder what happens if I set the height to 99.99999999999% ...
[01:52:42] <_|Nix|_> It breaks. I guess if it covers that last row, it's all over.
[01:53:04] <_|Nix|_> Too bad there's no way of saying 100% - 1px in CSS.
[01:53:13] <_|Nix|_> Oh, but there is!
[01:53:20] <_|Nix|_> bottom: 1px;
[02:28:30] <_|Nix|_> Well, that seems to work.
[02:29:21] * _|Nix|_ is linting and running unit tests ...

[04:52:08] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: *shake head* ... jQM is a repository of worked-around idiosyncrasies ...

[05:13:13] <agcolom> yes, I think the cross browser issues reach a higher level in the mobile world ;-)
[05:13:50] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes, that is an issues ;-)
[05:13:55] <agcolom> issue ^

[08:40:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup docs] Update open() code example - Gabriel Schulhof
[08:56:35] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Mind having a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4844? It seems to be broken on Android 4.0 when I load the URL mentioned in the comment, but when I download that example into the root of the jQM source tree and replace the <head> with that of index.html, it works fine.
[08:56:52] <_|Nix|_> Very weird.
[08:57:48] <_|Nix|_> The jsbin uses the latest code ... so, weird ...
[09:03:45] <_|Nix|_> Must be a jsbin thing ... though I can't see how ...
[09:09:11] <_|Nix|_> Also works fine if I edit the paths of the <script> and <link> tags to point to compiled/
[09:10:07] <_|Nix|_> Even the unmodified file, downloaded straight from jsbin.com and place on my Web server works fine. I really don't get why jsbin.com is broken.
[09:10:15] <_|Nix|_> BTW: It's broken in the Android 4.0 VM.
[09:36:46] <toddmparker_> hi all - here i am
[09:37:07] <toddmparker_> catching up
[09:44:57] <toddmparker_> wow _|Nix|_ - that is some good sleuthing on the Android crashiness. Now you're starting to think like us front-end devs. Black magic and duct tape.
[09:46:38] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: unless latest isn't up to date. did you check the modified date/SHA on latest?
[09:51:52] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: did you or anyone update the docs with the WP7 caveat? I can if not
[10:09:49] <toddmparker_> anyone here?
[10:17:10] <toddmparker_> seems like a lot of people want to use popups outside of pages
[10:17:27] <toddmparker_> the issue there was more around plugins like listview assuming a page for a parent?
[10:17:55] <toddmparker_> was that mostly for theme inheritance? if so could we fall back to the default theme if outside a page?
[10:18:02] <toddmparker_> johnbender and gseguin ^^
[10:21:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: reading
[10:22:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that's one dependency that we know about
[10:22:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: _all_ widgets assume a page
[10:22:45] <johnbender> in their construction
[10:22:54] <johnbender> even if that assumption manifests in some subtle form
[10:22:59] <johnbender> so there's danger there
[10:24:30] <toddmparker_> i know johnbender - not an overnight fix
[10:24:41] <toddmparker_> but something we should add to the queue
[10:25:11] <toddmparker_> as we explore multi-pane
[10:32:40] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Ah-hah!
[10:33:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[10:33:08] <uGoMobi> hey guys
[10:33:15] <Wilto> I had a feeling there’d be some kinda crazy hack.
[10:34:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: johnbender : I don't think header/footer/content works outside a page
[10:35:12] <johnbender> uGoMobi: toddmparker_: yah
[10:35:25] <johnbender> that's something we should remedy if we can
[10:35:34] <toddmparker_> agreed
[10:35:40] <uGoMobi> yeah page sections widget needs some attention
[10:35:54] <johnbender> there will be cases where we can't really without a lot of difficulty (peristent navbar)
[10:35:58] <uGoMobi> there is already an open ticket for trigger create not working on those
[10:35:59] <toddmparker_> the popup case is pretty clear: re-use the same popup, say with a listview-based menu inside across multiple pages
[10:36:36] <toddmparker_> header/footer could also make sense. If you left the header outside the page, it could truly be persistent
[10:37:06] <toddmparker_> so where are we with popup issues?
[10:37:23] <toddmparker_> seems like the android 4 crashing is fixed with that hack
[10:38:02] <toddmparker_> and with WP7 excluded from the popup history stuff, does that fix the odd scrolling and the sticky focus class issues?
[10:38:09] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_ ^^
[10:38:13] <uGoMobi> johnbender do you think the fake onhashchange for IE could cause the WP jumpiness?
[10:38:27] <uGoMobi> we insert a hidden iframe after the body
[10:38:53] <uGoMobi> I thought _|Nix|_ mentioned the jump is when the hash is changed
[10:39:46] <uGoMobi> just thinking out loud.... on load we do a silent scroll top
[10:40:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it's more likely to be something to with scrolling
[10:40:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you might try disabling the code in silentScroll
[10:40:22] <uGoMobi> could that iframe trick fire a load event
[10:40:25] <toddmparker_> is _|Nix|_ gone for the day?
[10:40:53] <toddmparker_> i know wilto mentioned that the focus class stuff was history related
[10:40:58] <uGoMobi> its dinner time here in europe
[10:41:05] <uGoMobi> maybe he will be back later
[10:42:23] <toddmparker_> ok uGoMobi
[10:42:33] <uGoMobi> I am almost done with reinstalling everything
[10:42:37] <toddmparker_> johnbender: you have a wp phone, right?
[10:42:50] <uGoMobi> will give that WP issue a look later tonight
[10:43:01] <toddmparker_> mind re-testing popups on latest? wilto is in vegas getting arrested and i'm in maine
[10:43:07] <uGoMobi> I can try on WP emulator
[10:43:07] <toddmparker_> thanks uGoMobi
[10:43:11] <toddmparker_> good idea
[10:43:42] <uGoMobi> at least I can check what events fire
[10:56:55] <Wilto> I like that no one bats an eye at “Wilto is in Vegas getting arrested.”
[10:57:22] <Wilto> toddmparker_: _|Nix|_ said he pushed a branch with the popup history omitted in WP.
[10:57:54] <toddmparker_> wilto: expected
[10:58:05] <toddmparker_> johnbender: ah, hadn't checked to see if a branch or master
[10:58:48] <toddmparker_> i'm ok with trying one more time to fix WP7, then kicking them out of back button support if it's so busted.
[10:58:51] <toddmparker_> thoughts?
[10:59:24] <Wilto> Oh, yeah. I’d way rather see that sucker fixed fo’ real.
[11:09:14] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm fine with that
[11:09:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: though I would keep the issue open especially because we haven't identified the root cuase
[11:09:54] <johnbender> it could still be our fault
[11:09:58] <johnbender> for whatever reason
[11:17:29] <toddmparker_> johnbender: yeah, agreed. excluding them means punting
[11:21:27] <toddmparker_> gseguin - you here?
[12:00:00] <gseguin> now i am
[12:00:12] <gseguin> what's up toddmparker_ ?
[12:00:50] <toddmparker_> Just mentioning that your twitter was probably hacked, like mine
[12:01:04] <toddmparker_> see you already fixed
[12:22:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I'm here.
[12:23:48] <_|Nix|_> Wilto, toddmparker_: fix-4784 is the branch.
[12:24:19] <toddmparker_> Hey _|Nix|_
[12:24:45] <toddmparker_> I don't have a WP device here and wilto is in vegas so...
[12:25:00] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi said he wanted to give this one more look I believe
[12:25:11] <toddmparker_> if that fails, we'll go with that option.
[12:25:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ... and I returned mine to the office because I'm going to be on vacation starting Monday for two weeks.
[12:25:19] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: Riiight
[12:25:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There are some hints in branch fix-4784
[12:25:43] <toddmparker_> Mind posting a quick summary of the popup issues and branches to basecamp
[12:25:59] <toddmparker_> just so we don't lose anything while you're gone
[12:26:10] <toddmparker_> we'll need to make a call on monday and move forward
[12:26:25] <toddmparker_> at this point, are there any significant android issues?
[12:26:55] <toddmparker_> or do we just have the WP scrolling and  focus class issues
[12:27:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Only one, and it appears only on jsbin: 4844 ...
[12:30:45] <toddmparker_> ok, that was hard to repo
[12:30:51] <toddmparker_> i think it's a jsbin thing
[12:30:57] <toddmparker_> so just wp7 now
[12:31:31] <toddmparker_> and in that branch where we nix history on popups for WP7, does that seem to fix the wild scrolling and sticky focus class
[12:32:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: It fixes it completely.
[12:32:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I hacked in a delay around the window.history.back() call yesterday, and I determined that the wild scrolling starts when I make that call.
[12:34:19] <toddmparker_> on both counts
[12:34:21] <toddmparker_> ?
[12:34:48] <toddmparker_> so from what you can tell, this isn't fixable
[12:35:35] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: It seems like IE is trying to be "smart" - like it's saving the scrollTop in the browser history entry so it can get back to it when it hits that entry.
[12:35:59] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: That's fine, but it must update the saved scrollTop the next time you navigate away from that entry - which it doesn't do.
[12:36:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: So, it ends up going to the spot where you first left the original page.
[12:38:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: On a different note: It might be worth doing the one-overlay-for-all-popups thing.
[12:38:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: We'd save one div per popup minus one.
[12:38:35] <toddmparker_> did you run into issues/complexities there?
[12:38:48] <toddmparker_> or is that looking good and could be merged in if we wanted?
[12:39:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Nono. Definitely 1.2.1 ...
[12:39:14] <toddmparker_> johnbender: you around? be good to plug you in here since _|Nix|_ is going to turn into a pumpkin
[12:39:20] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: ok
[12:39:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: It's easy to implement.
[12:39:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I might be able to squeeze it in before I leave.
[12:39:55] <toddmparker_> so at this stage, we need to re-look at wp7 and make a call on whether to kill history support for it. If so, that branch is ready to go
[12:40:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Yeah.
[12:40:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: reading back
[12:40:14] <toddmparker_> thought the singleton was implemented in that other branch?
[12:40:31] <toddmparker_> i'd rather make the fewest possible changes to finalize 1.2
[12:40:51] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: The singleton overlay resides in branch one-overlay-for-all-popups
[12:40:57] <toddmparker_> ok
[12:41:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK. Then let's leave it for 1.2.1.
[12:41:42] <toddmparker_> if you haven't mind updated the two wp7 issues with a summary of what you found, link to that branch, etc.
[12:42:02] <toddmparker_> i just don't want to miss something that was somewhere in IRC or in your head :)
[12:42:52] <_|Nix|_> Two WP7 issues? What's the other one? The sloppy focus?
[12:45:04] <_|Nix|_> OK, I made a bc post.
[12:48:02] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: just got some feedback from a friend
[12:48:18] <johnbender> one sec
[12:48:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's minor
[12:58:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The thing is - this thing doesn't scroll to the top - it scrolls to where you've first navigated away from the page.
[13:04:59] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: yes, the focus styles remaining on buttons in wp7
[13:05:11] <toddmparker_> going swimming
[13:05:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Made a not about that in my bc post.
[13:06:37] <_|Nix|_> s/not/note/
[13:08:46] <toddmparker_> thanks uGoMobi
[13:09:03] <toddmparker_> thanks _|Nix|_ - did you remember to check off us to notify?
[13:09:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Ummm ... not sure. I just typed it and posted it.
[13:09:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Can I do that after the fact?
[13:10:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK, I went Christmas tree on that sucker.
[13:12:40] <toddmparker_> yep, hit edit
[13:12:50] <toddmparker_> nice!
[13:13:05] <agcolom> hi everyone! quick question:
[13:13:28] <agcolom> is everything that has to do with listview just a single widget?
