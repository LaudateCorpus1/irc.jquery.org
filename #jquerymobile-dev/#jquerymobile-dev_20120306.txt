[07:34:43] <Wilto> Good morning to you too, Jenkins.
[08:07:05] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!

[08:46:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #3694 — `bottom: -1px; padding-bottom: 1px` on fixed footer, previously used to hide 1px “jitter” seen in many browsers during scroll, was triggering scrollbars in some browsers. - Mat Marquis
[08:57:56] <gseguin> good morning

[09:25:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] brought back the width: 100% to fixed toolbars, which generally makes the fullscreen bars behave again. If one adds padding to the toolbars in a custom setting, they'll need to adjust the width accordingly. Fixes #3678 - scottjehl
[09:34:26] <gseguin> Did you guys see this: http://www.sencha.com/blog/announcing-sencha-touch-2
[09:34:38] <gseguin> it looks pretty awesome on iPad
[10:06:26] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquery: Announcing the jQuery Foundation - http://t.co/htqtPS1D ★ http://bit.ly/yc2HJy
[10:07:02] <Wilto> Misread that as “federation,” and I was psyched that we were going all SciFi.

[10:18:47] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3748 on jquery-mobile, reported by rbdrbd (17m, 8s ago): 1.1RC1, Android 2.x: Page transitions broken when fixed toolbars used
[10:19:24] <Wilto> wat
[10:19:44] <johnbender> Wilto: it works for me on 2.3 but I was wondering if you could test on 2.2?
[10:19:57] <Wilto> Absolutely.
[10:20:14] <johnbender> we can downgrade the importance because of the market pen
[10:22:12] <Wilto> …Working fine on 2.2, for me.
[10:22:58] <johnbender> Wilto: hmm, I'll ask for his 2.2 device
[10:23:12] <Wilto> I’ll run it through the other 2.x gadgets, just in case.
[10:26:33] <Wilto> 2.1 is demoted to static positioning, and predictably working fine.
[10:26:45] <Wilto> 2.3 seems okay as well.
[10:32:30] <Wilto> Commented as well.
[10:44:19] <Wilto> In mere moments (hours), I will also have an Android emulator up and running to test on.
[11:02:29] <Wilto> Eesh, johnbender, any clues here? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3748#issuecomment-4350575
[11:02:30] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3748 on jquery-mobile, reported by rbdrbd (1h, 51s ago): 1.1RC1, Android 2.x: Page transitions broken when fixed toolbars used
[11:04:31] <Wilto> “<No ID>”
[11:06:05] <johnbender> Wilto: none, but it appears to be a timing issue
[11:06:12] <johnbender> which would explain why it might only show up on emulators
[11:06:19] <Wilto> Hm, no, same deal in both instances.
[11:06:25] <Wilto> Yeah, actually, that sounds about right.
[11:06:35] <johnbender> or a slow ass phone
[11:06:43] <johnbender> it wouldn't be the first time we had timeout problems
[11:07:39] <johnbender> though I think most of this stuff should be pretty deterministic
[11:08:16] <Wilto> oh my god “done loading packages” finally
[11:08:24] <Wilto> I’m not certain I believe you, Android SDK.
[11:08:33] <Wilto> Anyway, I should have emulators soonish.
[11:10:50] <Wilto> Nooope, downloading more crap.
[11:32:48] <johnbender> Wilto: question for you
[11:32:53] <Wilto> Hit me.
[11:32:58] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3747
[11:32:59] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3747 on jquery-mobile, reported by ryanhaney (2h, 14m ago): Listview does not allow per-listitem data-icon for split lists
[11:33:03] <Wilto> Maybe literally, depending on my answer.
[11:33:09] <johnbender> so the fix is a one liner
[11:33:13] <johnbender> but it's a feature
[11:33:18] <johnbender> so we'll wait until after the rc
[11:33:22] <johnbender> BUT
[11:33:27] <Wilto> BUT
[11:33:34] <johnbender> the icon data attribute should go on the li not the link right?
[11:33:51] <Wilto> Yyyyy—…
[11:33:57] <Wilto> Maybe.
[11:34:00] <Wilto> Hm.
[11:34:01] <johnbender> or can you have an icon on the first link and the second link in the  splitlist
[11:34:13] <johnbender> if you can it doesn't work currently :x
[11:34:26] <Wilto> Yeah, I wanna say it should go on the link.
[11:34:34] <johnbender> really?
[11:34:51] <johnbender> seems odd to break with the previous convention of it being on the list item for non split list links
[11:35:02] <Wilto> One sec.
[11:36:55] <Wilto> Yeah, list items, you’re right.
[11:37:13] <Wilto> Assume the opposite of anything I say, today.
[11:38:38] <johnbender> cool
[11:38:49] <johnbender> I'll push a branch and thank the guy profusely for including a fiddle with his issue :D
[11:43:29] <Wilto> Seriously. It’s like hitting the issue tracker lottery, lately.

[12:59:50] <Wilto> johnbender: You had an Android emulator going at one point, yeah?
[13:00:29] <Wilto> Please tell me there’s a button I can press to make something vaguely reminiscent of a phone appear on my screen.
[13:01:14] <Wilto> gseguin, maybe it was you?
[13:08:45] <johnbender> Wilto: I did yah
[13:08:55] <Wilto> oh god help me johnbender
[13:11:05] <johnbender> Wilto: I can take a look tomorrow
[13:11:08] <johnbender> just assign it to me
[13:11:19] <Wilto> Well, I gotta get this running for the PhoneGap bug anyway
[13:11:26] <Wilto> Plus, I mean, I should have this emulator going.
[13:11:40] <Wilto> I think I’m on track, anyway—no worries.
[13:12:32] <johnbender> Wilto: yah my setup is on my mac which I didn't bring with me today :(
[13:21:18] <gseguin> wad I do?
[13:22:11] <gseguin> Wilto: I did run the android emulator once when I had time to kill

[13:22:42] <gseguin> lol
[13:23:03] <Wilto> I think I’ve maybe got it. Just gotta download these 46 “AVD”s again.
[13:23:07] <Wilto> For like the sixth time today.
[13:23:26] <gseguin> yeah you've got to download the right rom first
[13:23:26] <Wilto> My MBA is now about 85% “AVD”s, and I still don’t know what the ’eff they are.

[13:43:54] <johnbender> Wilto: I'll set that build up now
[13:43:58] <johnbender> shouldn't take me too long

[13:44:13] <Wilto> Oh, badass. Thanks, dude!
[13:44:34] <Wilto> Scott just wile’d out and wrote a fixed positioning polyfill, in response to that thread from hell on the forum.

[13:45:50] <Wilto> They’re not wrong, that internet. Just that they go about being right in the most obnoxious possible way sometimes.
