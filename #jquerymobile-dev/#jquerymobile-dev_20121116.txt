[07:00:54] <toddmparker> morning all
[07:03:40] <arschmitz_> Morning
[07:11:53] <toddmparker> hey arschmitz
[07:16:02] <arschmitz_> quiet in here this morning
[08:29:30] <toddmparker> <crickets>
[08:30:13] <arschmitz> ^^ pretty much
[08:47:42] <toddmparker> i'm going to be working on revising my breakpoint css today
[09:24:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[09:24:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[09:25:50] <arschmitz> im looking at issue 3912 i had started looking into it a while back since its fixed toolbar related but getting some different results then you
[09:26:10] <arschmitz> the selects under a fixed toolbar issue
[09:27:16] <arschmitz> i can replicate this pretty much 100% of the time if any form element is partially under a tool bar but 0% of the time if its fully under a toolbar
[09:27:38] <arschmitz> did you notice anything like that?
[09:28:49] <arschmitz> it almost seems like the click heuristics are prioritizing the form elements if they are exposed at all
[09:31:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when I tested it only happed with the select, not with the checkbox
[09:32:10] <arschmitz> hmm i got it on checkbox and on custom select as well
[09:32:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe depends on device
[09:32:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: could be im on an htc thunderbolt
[09:32:54] <arschmitz> they dont have those on browserstack
[09:33:11] <uGoMobi> first tested on HTC Incredible, later on I used browserstack Motorola Atrix
[09:33:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you notice if partially vs fully covered made a difference?
[09:33:46] <uGoMobi> I didn't test checkbox on the HTC though
[09:36:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the partially vs fully covered and the way it was reacting was what made me think it could be heuristics on the touch, and i noticed on your older test pages you have them all as partially covered
[09:38:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when testing my latest test page it also happened when you couldn't see the select button at all
[09:39:21] <uGoMobi> completely covered by header but still the selectmenu opened
[09:39:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm ok there must be some device specific stuff here because mine clearly acts different and im using your test page
[09:39:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah probably
[09:40:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you also said you couldnt do it with the custom select right? i could make it happen easier with the custom one
[09:40:07] <uGoMobi> that's to make things easier :(
[09:40:31] <uGoMobi> I did say that yes
[09:40:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this looks messier by the second :(
[09:41:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: present but completely inconsistant on different divices
[09:42:20] <arschmitz> if only i could type this morning :\
[11:35:00] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Who here knows a thing or two about the vclick event?
[11:35:13] <_|Nix|_> Whoever that is should have a look at #5149
[11:35:24] <_|Nix|_> Argh! Where's my auto-replace ?
[11:37:21] <_|Nix|_> OK, I forgot to add ^ and $ to the match ...
[11:38:20] <_|Nix|_> So, can a person who knows vclick please have a look at #5149?
[11:39:45] <toddmparker> arschmitz: i do think these touch devices do a lot of guessing so help you hit targets so it wouldn't be surprining if they assume you're trying to tap a form element
[11:40:19] <toddmparker> also, i've found that HTC device consistently have extra buggy behavior with touch targets
[11:40:56] <toddmparker> they must "improve" the core android stuff or be over correcting for their touch screens. this on 2.x era html devices, not sure about newer ones
[11:41:13] <toddmparker> might not be fixable on our end
[11:49:49] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah that was my thought im on 2.x also and everything i saw pointed to touch heuristics
[11:55:36] <toddmparker> i'm ok with closing things like this where it's out of our control. if an oem monkeys with touch targets to workaround their touchscreen digitzers, hey
[12:18:45] <arschmitz> toddmparker: Cool yeah this one is just like you describe with htc devices too. i think the screens are poor quality too.
[12:19:07] <arschmitz> toddmparker: want to close that one for me then its 3912
[12:21:30] <_|Nix|_> Got a question about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3886 and #5117: I think we should add an option as to whether a dialog should have a close button (default: true). However, if that option is true, I think we should first look if there's an anchor in the dialog's header and only generate a close button if there is no such anchor. This could address https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5117 ...
[12:25:44] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ^ What say you?
[12:25:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^ What say you?
[12:26:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ^ What say you?
[12:26:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: I think that makes sense
[12:26:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: was just trying to think if there is any situation where it would break current sites
[12:28:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Should be alright, as long as people don't add other buttons to their dialog headers.
[12:30:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We could also introduce a new data attribute: "data-dialog-close" ... the presence of this attribute in an anchor would signal to the dialog widget that it is that anchor that is to be used as the dialog close button, and not some other anchor present in the header.
[12:30:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then any and all buttons currently placed in dialog headers would be safe.
[12:30:50] <_|Nix|_> ... from being cannibalized into close buttons.
[12:30:53] <arschmitz> yeah and right now you can have a button in a dialog header so people very easily could
[12:31:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because adding options that accept URLs is probably a disaster waiting to happen.
[12:32:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess I didn't like the solution proposed in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5117 ...
[12:33:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont eaiter it seems unneeded
[12:33:28] <arschmitz> either
[12:34:14] <arschmitz> is there a reason he cant just add the close button himself with his own url?
[12:36:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think the reason is that the dialog will always create a close button - and good point! If we fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3886, we don't have to implement https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5117 at all ...
[12:37:28] <arschmitz> yeah and i mean as a temp workaround just set the auto one to display:none; and add your own
[12:37:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because people can just specify that the dialog have no close button, and they can then add close button by hand if they want it to behave differently from a standard-issue close button.
[12:37:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly thats what i was saying
[12:38:13] <_|Nix|_> *nod* ... that's the way to go ...
[12:38:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think an option for something like that is completely unneeded its too easy to work around
[12:39:12] <arschmitz> so yeah close and fix 3886
[12:45:57] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: I think the dialog idea makes sense to me
[12:46:10] <toddmparker> that way if people generate custom markup, it respects that
[12:46:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ^^ read our discussion after that
[12:47:04] <toddmparker> oooh, i see
[12:47:23] <toddmparker> yeah, makes sense. tell people to say "no thanks" to the auto gen close button, then add their own
[12:47:24] <arschmitz> much simplier and cleaner and no option
[12:47:28] <toddmparker> ok, cool
[12:50:18] <arschmitz> toddmparker: did you want to close that issue we were talking about before for me?
[12:54:40] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5117
[12:54:41] <toddmparker> ?
[12:55:30] <arschmitz> that one too lol but no 3912 with the funky clicking on htc
[12:56:29] <toddmparker> oh, yeah
[12:57:21] <toddmparker> closed 5117
[12:59:41] <toddmparker> arschmitz: can you post your findings to 3912 before I close?
[12:59:52] <arschmitz> sure ill do it right now
[13:03:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ok commented
[13:07:30] <arschmitz> toddmparker: our fixedtoolbars are starting to look a lot better for 1.3 we have closed 31 fixedtoolbar issues in the last month and i have a pr in for another that will bring us down to only 8
[13:07:54] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[13:10:04] <arschmitz> id love to get it down to like 5 before 1.3 lol
[13:10:15] <arschmitz> but i dont know if some of them are really fixable
[13:12:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: to your post before looking for input on vclick
[13:13:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Huh?
[13:14:43] <toddmparker> arschmitz: ok, closed
[13:14:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ sorry was still typeing
[13:15:21] <arschmitz> talking about issue #5149
[13:15:51] <jqcommit> [api.jquerymobile.com] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Zrh7mA
[13:15:52] <jqcommit> api.jquerymobile.com/master abb1a33 Anne-Gaelle Colom: modified dialog for new version of grunt (auto code for methods and events)
[13:16:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. What about it? We need to emit click there, but I dunno why we're not so emitting, and I dunno enough about vmouse to fix that issue.
[13:17:51] <arschmitz> i think whats happening is the tap event is eating it with its clear timeout so it emits the vlick but cancles it before the click is emmited
[13:18:59] <toddmparker> kinblas is the only guy who knows the guts of vclick
[13:19:05] <toddmparker> that was all based on his research
[13:19:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: *sigh* ... that's what I figured ...
[13:19:22] * _|Nix|_ looks on dolefully ...
[13:56:30] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #161: STILL UNSTABLE in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/161/
[13:58:46] <toddmparker> you might be able to catch him here, i see him pop in
[13:58:58] <toddmparker> johnbender might know quite a bit too
[13:59:08] <toddmparker> tho messing with click scares me
[14:09:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/_wGPSw

[14:12:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker: _|Nix|_: ios wont emit its click event if you "double tap" because of the double tap to zoom feature
[14:13:07] <toddmparker> that makes sense
[14:13:16] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: nice!
[14:13:27] <toddmparker> did you update the docs/demos?
[14:13:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Of course not :-S
[14:13:52] <toddmparker> btw - when we make changes like this, we should email agcolom with details so she can capture it in the docs
[14:13:54] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: ha!
[14:13:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I updated the unit test though ...
[14:13:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: uGoMobi: so thats why it get highlighted but never clicked
[14:14:00] <toddmparker> be cool to show this off
[14:14:07] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: most important
[14:14:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK ... me go email now
[14:15:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sorry above message was for you and toddmparker not uGoMobi: ugh apparently its time to go home
[14:16:01] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: and we should add it to that wiki page if not already there - release notes
[14:16:09] <toddmparker> just so we capture all this for the blog
[14:18:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Url me the wiki, please!
[14:19:06] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and arschmitz - i'm updating the table stuff to use "ui-responsive" for the preset breakpoint and removing the second option for the column toggle. one BP per widget now
[14:19:22] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.3-Release-Notes
[14:19:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Thanks!
[14:19:32] <toddmparker> np
[14:19:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker: I think thats the best way to go to start then if we decide to add more its easy and if not then great too
[14:23:18] <toddmparker> cool
[14:23:54] <arschmitz> toddmparker: by starting with just one we can kinda gauge the response to them and see if people want more or not also
[14:23:56] <toddmparker> I'm using 560px (35em) for the breakpoint on stack
[14:24:20] <toddmparker> that means i see tabular data on my iPhone 5 in landscape but that's kinda cool to demo
[14:24:33] <toddmparker> most phones aren't wide enough to catch that
[14:24:39] <toddmparker> unless your a phablet
[14:25:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, what's a tablet that's also a phone? A "tone"?
[14:25:27] <arschmitz> yeah i was checking the note its 800px device width!
[14:25:35] <toddmparker> yikes
[14:25:48] <arschmitz> yeah they went a little crazy on that one
[14:25:48] <toddmparker> the kindle fire and playbook and nook are all 600px
[14:25:56] <toddmparker> so it's fuzzy as hell
[14:26:19] <_|Nix|_> Kinda makes you wonder if media queries are of any use at all.
[14:26:25] <toddmparker> but that's ok. we just need to pick a width so we can have a starting point
[14:26:34] <toddmparker> if everyone gets annoyed and writes their own, it's a win
[14:26:44] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:26:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: grain of sand + oyster, eh?
[14:27:05] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: they are super useful but you need to look at you real design + content and see where adjustments make sense
[14:27:13] <toddmparker> yeah
[14:27:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, but on a phone, 800px doesn't mean the same as on a tablet. The DPI of a phone is probably much larger ...
[14:28:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... but, I guess, going by em instead of px might work ...
[14:30:17] <arschmitz> a note is nearly as big as a fire or playbook its a 6" screen
[14:30:40] <arschmitz> so it probably makes sense to lump it in with tablets anyway
[14:35:00] <toddmparker> yeah, guess so
[14:35:20] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to tables: http://git.io/yqTHEw
[14:35:20] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/tables a6da5c5 Todd Parker: Changed to a single breakpoint preset named "ui-responsive" for both modes...
[14:35:38] <toddmparker> the more you know, the more you understand there are no clear lines. you just need to make you stuff work well across every width
[14:36:11] <toddmparker> ok, so the tables are updated now with the generic breakpoint class
[14:36:17] <toddmparker> i can add this to the grids too
[14:38:03] <arschmitz> yeah i think just pick a good average point and go with it is the best we can do anything more specific they can override with their own css
[14:38:30] <toddmparker> right
[14:38:50] <toddmparker> we can haggle on 35, 38, 40 ems...
[14:39:13] <toddmparker> the column chooser is nice because it has breakpoints across the spectrum so you can finesse via priority levels
[14:39:35] <toddmparker> the issue with all this is if you have a column appear at a certain width like the docs. messes it all up
[14:39:51] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:40:04] <arschmitz> good thing is css is the easiest thing to override
[14:40:08] <toddmparker> but if you do that, you already know how to write MQs
[14:40:23] <arschmitz> and simple to show and demo and copy for their own use
[14:40:30] <toddmparker> …except for media queries...
[14:40:49] <arschmitz> right but thats where we provide an example and do our best to educate
[14:40:52] <toddmparker> yeah. i still have a bunch of demos with custom styles and breakpoints for people to review
[14:41:04] <toddmparker> i still need to flesh out a RWD guide
[14:42:00] <arschmitz> we could provide 100 break points and bloat the css and still not hit every use case theres just no winning with MQ's
[14:43:06] <_|Nix|_> L8R all ...
[14:43:19] <arschmitz> bye _|Nix|_: im out too
[14:43:38] <arschmitz> bye toddmparker
[14:52:45] <toddmparker> bye!
[15:07:06] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[15:07:07] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #849: FIXED in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/849/
[15:09:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: what was your question?
