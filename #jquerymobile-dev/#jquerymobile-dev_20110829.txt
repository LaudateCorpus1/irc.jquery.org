[08:46:18] <kinblas> todd_: ping
[09:08:22] <_nickel> todd_: scottjehl_ should I start looking at pull requests or killing bugs today?
[10:01:43] <kinblas> _nickel: how about looking at pulls that kill bugs?
[10:01:44] <kinblas> :-)
[10:02:15] <_nickel> kinblas: yah I'm looking at the slider change triggering
[10:02:31] <_nickel> people are requesting a callback instead of binding to change on the element
[10:02:34] <_nickel> which seems odd
[10:02:50] <_nickel> although I should really see if I have anything higher priority in the hopper
[10:03:14] <kinblas> _nickel: fyi, I have a couple of bug fixes already for the toggle switch which lives in slider
[10:03:18] <kinblas> I'll be landing those today
[10:03:22] <_nickel> kinblas: alright
[10:03:26] <_nickel> kinblas: I've got a blocker
[10:03:27] * kinblas gets the bug numbers
[10:03:28] <_nickel> I'll focuso n that
[10:03:44] <_nickel> a blocker that is not related to sliders
[10:04:49] <kinblas> _nickel: the bugs I have fixes for are 2345 and 2346
[10:04:50] <_nickel> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2329
[10:04:51] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2329 on jquery-mobile, reported by jostster (5d, 19h ago): Changing listview data then calling changePage causes the dom to drop html
[10:05:01] <_nickel> I think we can close that
[10:05:03] <kinblas> heh bug in social happy
[10:05:15] <kinblas> oh heh bug in Kin's processing
[10:05:35] <_nickel> and I'll put in a todo for sorting out reaping pages
[10:06:12] <kinblas> _nickel: yeah I saw that fly by the other day ... let us know what the problem is when you figure it out
[10:06:27] <_nickel> kinblas: you commented on the issue
[10:07:32] <kinblas> oh heh
[10:07:57] <kinblas> I thought that was the blocker you were working on
[10:08:21] <_nickel> kinblas: yah I saw it in my list and commented here before reading what it was :(
[10:08:28] * _nickel is doing confusing things
[10:40:46] <_nickel> scottjehl_: todd_: gseguin: anyone have an android 2.1 device handy?
[11:06:50] <kinblas> _nickel: I have one?
[11:13:33] <todd_> hi guys
[11:13:40] <todd_> we have an android 2.1
[11:14:25] <_nickel> kinblas: todd_ I had an issue I needed to verify
[11:14:30] <_nickel> need to find it
[11:15:22] <_nickel> todd_: it was about the hash not updating on back in 2.1
[11:17:21] <_nickel> todd_: kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2174
[11:17:21] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2174 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1m, 14h ago): Dialogs and nested lists break Ajax nav in Android 2.1
[11:18:03] <gseguin> sorry _nickel, just saw your message
[11:18:18] <gseguin> we do have a 2.1 device here as well
[11:18:47] <_nickel> gseguin: should be a quick test for that issue
[11:19:22] <_nickel> would be good to turn off pushstate and check that too but at least we might have a partial solution
[11:20:13] <kinblas> _nickel: so is it good enough to start at /test/ and navigate to the dialog sample?
[11:20:29] <kinblas> _nickel: if so, the dialog stuff was stripped just fine
[11:20:29] <_nickel> kinblas: yah
[11:20:56] <_nickel> for this bug we should, by rights, disable push state and test it too
[11:22:43] <gseguin> _nickel: so if I click on "open dialog" then press back the dialog should stay up for it to be a bug?
[11:23:11] <_nickel> yah
[11:23:40] <gseguin> can't reproduce on droid w/ 2.1
[11:26:38] <_nickel> gseguin: kk
[11:29:34] <_nickel> kinblas: gseguin: can either of you test it locally whilst disabling pushstate?
[11:30:06] <kinblas> _nickel: hmmm, push state wasn't used ... I could see hashes all the way through
[11:30:19] <_nickel> kinblas: cool, closing that bug then
[11:30:53] <kinblas> _nickel: that is, I used /test/ and every page I navigated to resulted in a hash update (no replacestate nice urls)
[11:31:07] <_nickel> k
[11:31:16] <_nickel> I'm guessing 2.1 didn't support
[11:31:22] <kinblas> ok
[11:32:02] <todd_> sounds like you don't need me to test 2.1
[11:32:07] <todd_> you guys are cranking
[11:32:25] <todd_> so i was just saying to scott that B3 should go out by Monday at the latest
[11:32:30] <todd_> does that seem reasonable?
[11:32:39] <_nickel> todd_: yah whats blocking?
[11:32:51] <todd_> looking
[11:33:52] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1&milestone=7
[11:34:32] <todd_> kinblas - what's your opinion on this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1925
[11:34:33] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1925 on jquery-mobile, reported by Brons (2m, 5d ago): Single tap triggers two actions, especially in Android B1
[11:34:47] <todd_> i know you've been chatting on this
[11:34:58] <_nickel> todd_: closed the pushstate support bug in there
[11:35:05] <todd_> _Nickel - you're fast, jsut closed that pushstate issue
[11:35:11] <todd_> yeah ^^
[11:35:47] <_nickel> todd_: I can take a look at that one
[11:35:54] <todd_> so we have the extensibility hook: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1872
[11:35:55] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1872 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (2m, 1w ago): Add extensibility hooks to allow for dynamic page creation and mgmt
[11:36:16] <_nickel> I think Kin and Scott were handling that one eh
[11:36:17] <_nickel> ?
[11:36:19] <kinblas> todd_: yeah I still need to move the actions to click
[11:36:38] <todd_> which actions?
[11:36:48] <todd_> hook?
[11:37:02] <kinblas> todd_: 1925 double tap
[11:37:07] <todd_> ah, yeah ok
[11:37:12] <kinblas> todd_: need to move the select actions
[11:37:23] <todd_> was that for some widgets like select?
[11:37:24] <kinblas> so the click doesn't get triggered on any inputs below it
[11:37:26] <todd_> yeah
[11:37:31] <todd_> i remember
[11:37:32] <todd_> ok
[11:37:37] <todd_> so that's a blocker
[11:37:49] <kinblas> todd_: and then there's some other guy that was having problems with listview and footers?
[11:37:51] <todd_> and #1872 shoudl land in some form
[11:38:01] <kinblas> todd_: yeah we need to fix that select double click problem
[11:38:47] <todd_> what issue # for the footers?
[11:39:48] <kinblas> todd_: It's that problem @jostster mentioned in the same bug
[11:45:32] <todd_> ah
[11:48:47] <todd_> the other item is the transitions
[11:51:00] <_nickel> todd_: kinblas: I'm going to work on getting the ci server moved over today
[11:51:13] <_nickel> seems like a good break in what I'm doing
[11:53:06] <todd_> k
[11:53:28] <todd_> so kinblas - what is needed for that extensibiliy hook?
[11:53:44] <todd_> think you and scott were dicussing his code
[11:55:57] <kinblas> todd_: we discussed it briefly ... scott's suggestion was good for ajax/json but a while back we had discussed a more elaborate means for supporting different ways folks may be constructing pages ... including non-ajax means.
[11:56:32] <kinblas> todd_: it's been hard to discuss these things as of late because scott and I are so distracted
[11:56:40] <kinblas> I'm trying to focus on jqm stuff this week
[11:56:48] <kinblas> and not let other internal stuff distract me
[12:02:56] <todd_> cool
[12:03:05] <todd_> this is the last week before the boat sails...
[12:03:18] <todd_> i knwo you had bigger ideas in mind for this
[12:03:39] <todd_> but if we can do something modest for 1.0, then add to this over time, that might be the safest way to proceed
[12:03:52] <todd_> unless you have a lot of time :)
[12:43:30] <scottjehl_> hey
[14:15:59] <eddiemonge> todd_: you around?
[14:16:08] <eddiemonge> gseguin: btw i started last week
[14:16:54] <gseguin> eddiemonge: that's great! congratulations!
[14:17:57] <eddiemonge> are you going to conf in boston next month?
[14:17:57] <todd_> hi eddiemonge
[14:18:02] <todd_> started where?
[14:18:37] <gseguin> eddiemonge: unfortunately not
[14:19:17] <eddiemonge> todd_: i made a change that should make writing weekly updates slightly easier. on the blog, there is a little box looking icon for a module called Global Content that will let you add a small snippet to each post that will expand to the full Get Latest Version text when the post is read
[14:19:41] <todd_> cool, thanks!
[14:19:50] <todd_> so i can just add it while writing
[14:20:22] <eddiemonge> you can look at the last post to see it. you could copy that line and it will do the same thing as clicking the icon and going through the short steps
[14:21:03] <eddiemonge> i also did something a bit more controversial as well. I updated the blog posting headlines to say Development Updates and made all of them the same format
[14:21:17] <eddiemonge> if this needs to go back to saying Team updates I can change it back really quick
[14:21:48] <eddiemonge> reason i did that is Team Updates sounds like people leaving and joining the team and other personnel related changes and not code changes
[14:21:59] <eddiemonge> the links themselves are the same though
[14:26:40] <eddiemonge> i also corrected the categories and add tags for future use
[14:42:19] <todd_> that's fine, as long as the links are the same
[14:43:28] <eddiemonge> yup i kept those the same
[15:25:26] <scottjehl_> kinblas
[15:25:30] <scottjehl_> ping
[15:25:33] <scottjehl_> :)
[15:26:46] <kinblas> scottjehl: Pinging kinblas [208.73.210.29] with 32 bytes of data
[15:27:57] * kinblas has been smoothing transitions on honeycomb today
[15:29:14] <scottjehl_> heya
[15:29:17] <scottjehl_> oh nice!
[15:33:24] <scottjehl_> so - for that part you're talking about
[15:33:32] <scottjehl_> above
[15:33:41] <kinblas> ??
[15:33:46] <kinblas> transitions?
[15:33:58] <scottjehl_> the part about the hook
[15:34:08] <kinblas> uh-huh
[15:34:25] <kinblas> scottjehl: You have a branch right?
[15:34:31] <kinblas> so I can re-look at what you did?
[15:34:42] <scottjehl_> yeah I'm more looking to chat about the part you want to get in there
[15:34:49] <scottjehl_> lightweight ways to do so
[15:35:15] <kinblas> oh ok ... basically I want to make sure we don't box ourselves in with our minimal support for 1.0
[15:35:34] <scottjehl_> minimal support?
[15:35:42] <kinblas> *AND* I want to make sure that whatever we do for 1.0, won't screw folks that wrote something against 1.0?
[15:35:51] <kinblas> minimal == json/ajax?
[15:35:59] <kinblas> wasn't that what you implemented?
[15:36:15] <scottjehl_> yeah I mean, that part is small and rather simple to drop-in
[15:36:23] <scottjehl_> I'm more interested in the part you're looking for
[15:36:29] <scottjehl_> the data tie in
[15:36:30] <kinblas> basically what I want to do is allow folks to short-circute loadPage()
[15:36:35] <kinblas> do what they need to do
[15:36:49] <scottjehl_> think we could do something with triggerHandler?
[15:36:51] <kinblas> and then be able to resume the changePage
[15:37:01] <scottjehl_> hmm
[15:37:27] <scottjehl_> okay yeah
[15:37:41] <scottjehl_> that could be a bit of work huh
[15:38:05] <kinblas> eh, I'm not sure there's a lot
[15:38:15] <kinblas> we just need to figure out a nice way to allow for this
[15:38:34] <kinblas> is it via an event notificaiton mechanism? (the trigger you keep mentioning)
[15:38:50] <kinblas> is it via a register callback mechanism
[15:39:04] <kinblas> or register content-type mechanism
[15:39:13] <scottjehl_> what if we just triggerd beforechangepage using triggerHandler and let people return false to prevent the rest from running?
[15:40:26] <kinblas> so the problem with that
[15:40:34] <scottjehl_> container.bind( "beforechangepage", function( url ){ /* if url is foo, create a page based on data xyz, call changePage to that new page, and return false */ });
[15:40:39] <kinblas> is there is a whole-lotta-book-keeping implemented in changePage()
[15:41:14] <scottjehl_> right, this would allow you to listen for page change requests, handle them on your own
[15:41:19] <scottjehl_> still using changePage
[15:41:43] <kinblas> oh you meant conditionally short-circuit, load the content into the dom, and then call changePage() again to make the new page current?
[15:42:05] <scottjehl_> ya
[15:42:30] <scottjehl_> if it's a data structure already present, it'd be pretty simple
[15:42:53] <kinblas> I guess they could do that ... you can get the equivalent with a monkeypatch sans event listener.
[15:43:12] <scottjehl_> ... not even conditionally, if you're whole app was driven by some preloaded data structure
[15:43:41] <scottjehl_> yeah but this might feel a little cleaner than a monkeypatch
[15:43:49] <kinblas> yeah I know
[15:44:14] <scottjehl_> just thinking, it's far from our default use case, but we could make it pretty easy to do just by triggering that event differently
[15:44:54] <kinblas> so with that approach all that is missing is code to pass in an event to our beforechangepage trigger ... if we pass in  an event, we can check the preventDefault() on it and then just return.
[15:44:57] <scottjehl_> heck, my branch wouldn't be needed either. You could just bind to that event and call $.getJSON(url) etc
[15:46:11] <kinblas> scottjehl: so that as a minimal way to do it, wouldn't block any other elaborate scheme later
[15:46:26] <kinblas> ship it
[15:46:28] <kinblas> :-)
[15:46:30] <scottjehl_> yeah I think so. I mean, triggerHandler would let us check the return value. if ( container.triggerHandler( "beforechangepage" ) === false ){ return; }
[15:46:52] <scottjehl_> not sure if what you're thinking about is a little better though
[15:46:59] <kinblas> scottjehl: but does triggerHandler() propagate?
[15:47:00] <scottjehl_> with preventDefault instead
[15:47:37] <scottjehl_> good pt. not sure. I guess I'd prefer if we implemented this where our current behavior is the "default" you're preventing
[15:47:42] <scottjehl_> like you're saying
[15:48:00] <kinblas> yeah
[15:48:01] <scottjehl_> would you be able to take a crack at how that event trigger would look?
[15:48:19] <kinblas> actually there's an example of how to call it in vmouse.js
[15:48:28] <scottjehl_> and what args we'd pass to the callback
[15:48:28] <kinblas> it's basically new jQuery.Event
[15:48:30] <kinblas> pass it in
[15:48:35] <kinblas> and then when the event comes back
[15:48:49] <kinblas> you can call defaultPrevented()
[15:48:53] <kinblas> or whatever that call was
[15:49:41] <kinblas> scottjehl: so we would just forward the arguments list from changePage to the event
[16:01:58] <scottjehl_> hey sorry
[16:02:28] <scottjehl_> hmm okay. so that's synchronous then?
[16:03:18] <scottjehl_> Which part of vmouse do you do this? I'll try an implement on the plane tonight
[16:03:27] <scottjehl_> (heading to London in a few)
[16:03:34] <scottjehl_> kinblas^
[16:03:39] <Ned_> Ahhh, activity :p
[16:04:52] <Ned_> are there any developers around who can talk about a pull request I filed ? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2352
[16:04:53] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by martynsmith (18h, 40m ago): Bind orientation and resize events directly rather than on mobileinit
[16:04:57] <Ned_> Ooo ... botty
[16:07:57] <_nickel> Ned_: if you've submitted someone will get to. We promise :D
[16:08:10] <_nickel> Ned_: we do apprecaite it
[16:08:41] <Ned_> _nickel: righto, it was more a case of pondering if I've actually done the right thing
[16:08:54] <Ned_> I guess someone will contact me if it doesn't make sense :_)
[16:09:02] <Ned_> I've patched my local copy anyway to make it work :p
[16:09:17] <kinblas> scottjehl: in general there is no promise that changePage() will be synchronous
[16:09:26] <kinblas> scottjehl: hence the need for events
[16:09:40] <scottjehl_> I just meant checking the defaultPrevented
[16:09:47] <Ned_> actually, on a slightly different note, is it possible to "abort" a page change with a beforepageshow event ?
[16:09:52] <kinblas> oh the notification is synchronous
[16:10:06] <scottjehl_> Ned_ this is what we're discussing now
[16:10:11] <kinblas> Ned_: heh we're talking about that!
[16:10:12] <Ned_> scottjehl_: oh, interesting :p
[16:10:12] <scottjehl_> :)
[16:10:20] * Ned_ idles along ...
[16:10:52] <kinblas> scottjehl: so after you manually trigger an event (with an event object)
[16:11:07] <scottjehl_> okay, Kin. I can give that a shot then. Tonight I'm looking to get last-scroll back in action, this issue, and start on iOS5 scrolling. (long flight) :)
[16:11:09] <kinblas> after the trigger call, you just call that method on the event object you passed in
[16:11:26] <kinblas> scottjehl: you going on vacation or talk circuit?
[16:11:29] <kinblas> :-)
[16:11:36] * kinblas always panics when scott leaves
[16:12:34] <scottjehl_> http://2011.dconstruct.org/workshops/scott-jehl
[16:12:59] <kinblas> scottjehl: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.vmouse.js#L175
[16:13:03] <kinblas> there's an example
[16:13:30] <kinblas> scottjehl: you jet-setter
[16:14:48] <kinblas> scottjehl_: btw, the transitions is taking so long because of the testing ... it's like I tweak something and it looks good on one device but it inevitably breaks something somewhere else
[16:14:52] <kinblas> it's maddening
[16:15:20] <scottjehl_> heh
[16:17:43] <scottjehl_> ugh. sorry to hear that
[16:18:59] <kinblas> Ned_: regarding  your patch ... scottjehl_ is probably the person you want to talk to since he added that code. I'm not sure if the delay was necessary for a reason.
[16:19:30] <Ned_> kinblas: okay, I'll wait for scottjehl_ :-)
[16:20:23] <Ned_> kinblas: I think I might constitute a weird case, I'm using head.js which is what's causing the problem
[16:20:26] <Ned_> :p
[16:20:39] <Ned_> well, s/causing/exposing/
[16:20:39] <Ned_> ;-)
[16:21:17] <kinblas> how does head.js cause a DOM Ready event to fire before the file loads?
[16:21:32] * kinblas knows domready is a hack to begin with ... but is still curious
[16:21:36] <scottjehl_> Ned_ umm yeah I think this looks good, although I think I'd like these events to be bound only in passing browsers
[16:21:56] <scottjehl_> which means somehow tying into the registerEventHandlers funtion
[16:21:57] <Ned_> "only in passing browsers" ?
[16:22:43] <scottjehl_> (which we use to only bind our hashchange, click, etc in browsers that pass gradeA()  - media query supporting or IE basically)
[16:23:02] <Ned_> right
[16:23:21] <scottjehl_> hmm. I think we need registerEventHandlers to be more of an event for that to happen
[16:23:26] <Ned_> I guess I don't understand enough of what's going on
[16:23:30] <scottjehl_> for now, I think I'm okay with this suggestion
[16:23:43] <scottjehl_> I'll need to test it though... might be a little while
[16:23:47] <Ned_> the short version of my problem is that mobileinit was happening after the orientation was being triggered manually
[16:23:58] <Ned_> and so the orientation events weren't bound
[16:24:21] <Ned_> and consequently my iPad2 was missing a bunch of stuff (like the html classes, and the initial pageshow events)
[16:25:04] <scottjehl_> hmm k. Did you try using media queries for the orientation instead?
[16:25:04] <Ned_> scottjehl_: sweet, do you guys have an automated test suite thing ?
[16:25:12] <Ned_> media queries ?
[16:25:42] <scottjehl_> yeah we deprecated that whole media.classes js file 2 or 3 releases ago
[16:25:50] <scottjehl_> in favor of css3 media queries
[16:25:55] <Ned_> right ...
[16:25:59] <Ned_> I should go read about that
[16:26:10] <Ned_> although as I said, the pageshow event wasn't firing either
[16:26:16] <Ned_> which was a bit of a show stopper
[16:26:26] <scottjehl_> @media screen and (orientation:landscape){
[16:26:33] <scottjehl_> that should do what you need
[16:26:37] <Ned_> scottjehl_: can you do media queries for width ?
[16:26:51] <scottjehl_> all and (min-width: 500px){...
[16:27:03] <scottjehl_> max-width, device-width, etc
[16:27:14] <Ned_> right ...
[16:27:18] <scottjehl_> we only had this class thing as a patch for IE
[16:27:25] <scottjehl_> but now we recommend using respond.js
[16:27:32] <scottjehl_> which brings media query support to IE
[16:27:41] <Ned_> right
[16:27:46] <scottjehl_> anyway so sorry but I gotta jet!
[16:27:48] <Ned_> I don't have to support IE myself, so win for me
[16:27:49] <Ned_> :-)
[16:27:51] <scottjehl_> literally. that was lame
[16:27:57] <Ned_> scottjehl_: thanks for the ideas
[16:28:02] <Ned_> I'll have a poke of media queries
[16:28:06] <scottjehl_> sure thing - thanks for the pull
[16:28:09] <Ned_> but I'd still like the patch to fix the page events :-)
[16:28:13] <Ned_> laters
[16:31:43] <scottjehl_> sure thing!
[16:31:52] <scottjehl_> kinblas - thanks and I'll be on tomorrow
[16:32:13] <scottjehl_> the time diff will be interesting, but I suspect I'll be on late enough to catch you
[16:32:18] <scottjehl_> later
