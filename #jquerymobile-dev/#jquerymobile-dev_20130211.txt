[03:11:35] <bot-t> (57 mins 10 secs ago) <uGoMobi> tell _|Nix|_ : Wanted to ask you if my assumption here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5596#issuecomment-13374223 is correct. If so, we can close that ticket
[03:13:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If the bottom of the popup goes below the height of the page it will cause the height of the document to increase. Only negative coordinates will cause clipping.
[03:13:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, thanks
[03:14:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess we could make it so the popup shows up flush with the top of the window if it's taller than the window ... currently it becomes centred if that's the case ....
[03:14:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, when you're dealing with popups that are taller than the window, you've already got some pretty bad UI design issues ...
[03:15:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes I agree
[03:15:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... so I wouldn't consider this to be super-high-priority.
[03:15:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's the dev his reponsibility to make the popup fit the screen
[03:16:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly ... 
[03:16:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah very low priority
[03:17:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's why I'm inclined to just let the bug sit there ... it's debatable whether we should align tall popups with the top of the window, or whether we should centre them ...
[03:18:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just marged it as "Low"
[03:20:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[03:26:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: going to close the ticket as duplicate... found this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5605
[03:29:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was gonna ask you: Is there a reason why we apply theme, corners, and shadow to the popup payload instead of the popup container?
[03:30:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I ask because, as I'm writing the arrow extension, I'm discovering a need to be able to measure the width/height of the popup without any border ... it's not super-crazy-important, but it might make a difference with some themes.
[03:30:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know there was a specific reason
[03:31:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: now I am trying to remember what it was :)
[03:31:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IIRC there was a situation where, if the corners are applied to the container, the popup payload pokes through the corners.
[03:31:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Bad border-radius clipping.
[03:32:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, I'm thinking that we can solve that by having ui-popup inherit border radius - just like we did with ui-btn-inner.
[03:32:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then again, there might be other reasons too - like selectors being > specific.
[03:32:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah... I did same for that grid listview demo... http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/listviews/grid-listview.html
[03:33:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It would really be good if the popup payload was as untouched as possible and we applied the decorations to the container.
[03:33:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know there were issues when the container has the body styling
[03:35:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. NM then. It's pretty good as it is, even now - so, unless somebody creates a theme with a checker pattern as the background, it should be OK, and if and when we make it part of the lib, we can probably come up with a situation that avoids the slight off-by-ones altogether.
[03:35:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think it was when you have to set a max-height or max-width
[03:35:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-arrow/docs/demos/demos/popups/arrow.html
[03:35:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you need to be able to set that for the popup itself
[03:35:52] <_|Nix|_> Aaaah, OK.
[03:36:19] <uGoMobi> but if the container has the background and border you obviously get problems
[03:36:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, even if there is no padding at all between the container and the popup?
[03:38:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, like I said. Really low prio as well. I'll poke around some more with the arrow thing, and we can eventually look at it together when we've got more time.
[03:39:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the framework sets a max-width for the container so if you set a smaller max-width for the popup you still would have an issue, regardless of padding
[03:41:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's what I figured: It's not 100% possible to make sure the popup container shrink-wraps the popup payload. In such cases, I guess we don't want the border to appear "detached" from the payload.
[03:42:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah true
[03:52:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: BTW - if you need the height/width without border you can use jQuery .css() to get the value for the border-width property
[03:53:44] <uGoMobi> that demo looks really neat!
[03:56:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, and I fixed it so the gradient inside the arrow is the same as the gradient inside the popup.
[03:56:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... except of a potential off-by-one error, but that's only visible if you have, like, a checkerbox background for ui-body-*

[04:09:47] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[04:10:00] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[04:10:04] <uGoMobi> morning
[04:10:16] <uGoMobi> how are things going?
[04:10:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! How's the family?
[04:10:33] <arschmitz> good
[04:10:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good to hear!
[04:10:57] <arschmitz> yeah baby is still in icu but hes doing great
[04:11:10] <uGoMobi> ah great
[04:11:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hope he didn't lose too much weight - they always do after they're born, but the curve starts to turn around after that.
[04:12:24] <arschmitz> no actually first day he gained lol
[04:12:33] <arschmitz> but then he lost a little but hes back gaining again
[04:13:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome! Very, very cool!
[04:14:57] <arschmitz> for sure
[04:15:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you visit the hospital couple times a day or you stay there?
[04:18:21] <arschmitz> i stayed there first there days
[04:18:47] <arschmitz> yesterday i went over a few times but had to get stuff done at house had a string of bad luck had to deal with
[04:19:08] <arschmitz> washing machine broke
[04:19:16] <arschmitz> and then got 3 feet of snow and snowblower broke
[04:19:19] <arschmitz> lol
[04:19:50] <_|Nix|_> Egads.
[04:19:59] <uGoMobi> pfff
[04:20:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We don't even use snowblowers around here. We just get those big-ass pushing shovels.
[04:20:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and walk up the snowbanks we ourselves build.
[04:20:48] <arschmitz> yeah those work good as long as the snow isnt too wet and heavy
[04:20:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... that's true.
[04:21:14] <arschmitz> ha ha the bank at the end of my driveway from plow trucks was over my head
[04:21:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: With wet snow you advance only, like, 6 inches before it gets too heavy :)
[04:21:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, yeah ... common scenario.
[04:22:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's funny how you get to see "corner cases" IRL.
[04:22:56] <arschmitz> lol
[04:38:59] <_|Nix|_> How kosher is it to use box-sizing: border-box?

[04:39:34] <arschmitz> hey if either of you have a second to check out the h2widget in demos that would be awesome
[04:39:56] <arschmitz> its on all the widgets up to controlgroups right now
[04:40:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we do use box-sizing border-box alread, just have to check old IE
[04:40:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: ^^
[04:40:46] <uGoMobi> _s/alread/already/
[04:40:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lemme guess: old IE does not support it?
[04:40:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool, I wil check it out
[04:41:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good guess :)
[04:41:10] <_|Nix|_> :-S
[04:41:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it looks pretty much exactly like what toddmparker had put in on some already
[04:41:35] <arschmitz> but all automagic 
[04:41:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't know by hard what version of IE started to support it
[04:41:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nice
[04:42:24] <arschmitz> all you do is make sure the widget js is included and add data-quicklinks="true" to the page div
[04:42:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool!
[04:42:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not supported in IE7, and partially after that :(
[04:42:57] <arschmitz> could roll the widget js into the _assets/js/ because it has to come after jqm
[04:43:06] <arschmitz> couldn't 
[04:43:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I could't do it either for the slider tooltip demo.
[04:44:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is this supposed to work in the version of the docs in the zip too?
[04:44:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You could wrap the whole thing in a $( document ).bind( "mobileinit", function() { ... } );
[04:44:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont see why it wouldnt
[04:45:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That'll delay its execution until jQM is loaded.
[04:45:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: all scripts in _assets/js/ are combined in one file and gseguin|away told me that is done in alphabetical order
[04:45:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ahh yeah good idea dont know why i didnt think of that
[04:45:46] <uGoMobi> so maybe you have to call it zeeplink ;-)
[04:46:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I thought of it for the slider demo, but ultimately I didn't do it that way because I want that to be in the library eventually, so I wanted to keep it as relocatable as possible.
[04:46:24] <_|Nix|_> :)
[04:46:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ahh ok now ill just need to do like nix said and put it in a mobile init wrapper
[04:46:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and besides, in the case of the slider, it's only one demo, not something that can be used all over the demos,.
[04:46:55] <arschmitz> right
[04:46:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok even better
[04:47:10] <arschmitz> yup ill fix that in a few minutes
[04:47:34] <uGoMobi> just something we have to keep in mind if we add scripts there
[04:47:51] <arschmitz> could use some help today to try and go through all the pages that need it and make sure the placeholder stuff toddmparker: added is removed and data-quicklinks to all the page containers
[04:48:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I moved script for the slider tooltip extension demo to its own folder
[04:48:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure, working on demos all day anyway
[04:48:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[04:49:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Were you able to make use of that new AJAX-script-and-css-loading capability to avoid copying code?
[04:49:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[04:50:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: works great
[04:50:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: would be cool if we could do it the same for html markup
[04:51:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so we don't have to copy markup either
[04:51:13] <uGoMobi> but probably more complex
[04:51:33] <uGoMobi> also might run into issues with already enhanced markup I guess
[05:00:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, since this is AJAX, already-enhanced markup is not a problem.
[05:01:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, now that I think about it, this prevents it from working via file://
[05:01:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not sure how important that is.
[05:01:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[05:02:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not really important, just an "if possible" idea
[05:03:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When I click on a section, it goes there, but the panel doesn't close. When I then click return to top, first the panel closes, and then I need to click return to top again to return to top.
[05:04:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Might be agood idea to close the panel when you click one of its links.
[05:04:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Chrome Version 24.0.1312.69 on Linux.
[05:05:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Testing docs/demos/widgets/buttons/index.html
[05:07:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i didnt attempt to deal with open close state of panel but easy enough to add that
[05:20:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you said the the section links were working on /test/ for you right?

[07:15:41] <toddmparker> Hi all
[07:32:13] <toddmparker> catching up...
[07:35:06] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: that popup arrow demo is looking sharp
[07:35:25] <toddmparker> arschmitz: cool you got that jump to started
[07:36:01] <toddmparker> panels are populated but clicking them doesn't seem to jump me down in chrome/mac
[07:37:03] <toddmparker> the back to top links may need some love…what do you think about floating them right made making them gray and small?
[07:37:29] <toddmparker> think those and the "jump to section" need to have the demos font set on 'em too
[07:40:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah they were working for _|Nix|_ and they work for me local need to see whats going on.
[07:41:04] <arschmitz> and for css i didnt do anything there i copied what you had for the buttons one you did
[07:41:13] <arschmitz> so feel free to change anything with that
[07:44:27] <toddmparker> arschmitz: sure, cool
[07:44:36] <toddmparker> happy to hop on styling duty later today

[10:47:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: you dont need to include the seperate h2Widget.js now either its just part of the _assets/js/
[10:48:20] <toddmparker> JasonDScott___: next week would be ideal…mind sending a one time invite?
[10:48:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker: just checked test is updated and working now
[10:48:27] <toddmparker> arschmitz: great
[10:49:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: is final still going today or did that get delayed and i missed it
[10:49:26] <arschmitz> was kinda absent this weekend had some stuff to deal with as you might guess
[10:49:41] <toddmparker> arschmitz: looks much better
[10:49:55] <toddmparker> arschmitz: no worries at all. amazed you're working at all
[10:50:15] <toddmparker> arschmitz: shooting for *next* monday
[10:50:23] <arschmitz> yeah its been crazy with deaglan in icu and the snowstorm and it seems everything at house is breaking ha ha
[10:50:36] <toddmparker> i lost all my gutters
[10:50:37] <arschmitz> toddmparker: oh awesome will give me more time to test this a lot better
[10:50:43] <toddmparker> ya
[10:50:56] <toddmparker> is the back to top injected by the h2 script or the view source?
[10:51:11] <arschmitz> i had washing machine break 2 snowblowers break and ran out of oil!
[10:51:17] <toddmparker> yikes
[10:51:37] <arschmitz> h2widget injects the panel the panel open button and the back to top links
[10:51:49] <arschmitz> and any needed id's as well
[10:52:46] <arschmitz> so you dont need to do anything at all besides add data-quicklinks="true"
[10:52:55] <arschmitz> it generates everything from there
[10:54:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am sure if this is because of the h2 widget but some links to demos are broken http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/popups/dynamic-popup.html
[10:54:33] <uGoMobi> I have same issue with demo I am working on local

[10:56:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: hi, sorry to you lost your gutters... again :(
[10:57:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Re: disable/enable zoom and blinks with page transitions
[10:58:05] <uGoMobi> I wanted to look into all transition related issues for 1.4
[10:58:47] <uGoMobi> but we can test the reported solution for 1.3.1
[10:59:15] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yeah, i really want to give that another look or 1.4
[10:59:38] <toddmparker> yeah, if that suggestion isn't super disruptive, we could look at it for 1.3.1
[10:59:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I made a list that we can add to the 1.4 planning wiki
[11:00:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I think we disable/enable zoom for fixed toolbars on Android
[11:00:45] <uGoMobi> I asked if people tested the solution with fixed toolbars and they say it works fine 
[11:01:46] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: we do, yep
[11:01:58] <toddmparker> works w/o zoom?
[11:02:11] <toddmparker> maybe they have zoom off across the board?
[11:02:12] <uGoMobi> that's what they said in a comment
[11:02:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill check that out when i get a second
[11:02:21] <uGoMobi> yeah, we have to test for ourselves
[11:02:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks, I will keep digging into it too
[11:03:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: reminds me of that zoom issue I had with android when working on panels
[11:03:37] <uGoMobi> I fixed that with overflow-x: hidden
[11:04:50] <uGoMobi> maybe the zoom issue on Android with page transitions is gone because we set overflow-x hidden for the body too
[11:04:59] <uGoMobi> not sure if that was added later
[11:05:24] <johnbender> alright
[11:05:27] <uGoMobi> anyway... will test it
[11:05:30] <johnbender> I have officially registered for portland
[11:05:38] <uGoMobi> johnbender: cool!
[11:05:47] <johnbender> now I need to decide if I want to give a talk
[11:05:51] <johnbender> and what said talk will be on
[11:20:21] <agcolom> hi all... just to let you know I have a really bad cold and feel terrible, so best I just try to catch up with sleep tonight....
[11:25:52] <agcolom> toddmparker: ^ + I think we can optimise the api docs widget section by combining some of the iframes. That will help reduce loading time. I'll be able to focus on that after the 11th March (maybe a bit before, but definitely after the 25th Feb)
[11:29:44] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Old build #171: STILL UNSTABLE in 1 hr 1 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/171/
[12:03:18] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15frequent opened issue #5629: feature request: make listview filter a stand alone widget  02http://git.io/3HfPHQ
[12:10:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the h2widget breaks links to pages in a multipage template. I haven't found the cause yet, maybe you can look into it later. I can continue working on demos local by disabling deeplinks so... no rush
[12:11:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: examples of demos using multipage are http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/popups/dynamic-popup.html and http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/swipe/swipe-list.html
[12:12:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool thanks ill look at it i didnt test multipage though i thought i had that taken care of apparently not :( ill find the issue and fix it later tonight or first thing in morning im heading back to hospital shortly
[12:13:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool if you can take a look at it when you have time, but like I said... no rush
[12:14:25] <arschmitz> yeah i had to modify some clickhandeling to make it work until i can make the actual changes to nav 
[12:14:37] <arschmitz> so something in there needs to be updated
[12:15:24] <arschmitz> it is not suposed to modify links to internal pages and just ignore them but clearly its not
[13:12:44] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and arschmitz - cool. http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/tableview/demo.html
[13:12:50] <toddmparker> table filter would be nice
[13:29:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, we were planning already on turning listview filter into a real widget extension for 1.4, would be great if it could be used for other widgets like table as well
[13:29:43] <uGoMobi> I remember there was a feature request for filter on custom multiple select as well
[14:36:20] <_|Nix|_> So, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5512 seems only to be happening with internal pages. AJAX-ed-in pages work fine.
[15:10:45] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: good call on that filter stuff. select filter is often requested
[15:11:01] <toddmparker> mind adding that to the roadmap?

[16:09:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: toddmparker:  the perf branch is in good shape I think
[16:09:30] <johnbender> I added a kitchen sink set of tests
[16:09:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: toddmparker: until we can automate I think we should do a baseline after each release
[16:10:03] <johnbender> and then before we go to beta
[16:10:07] <johnbender> for each of the tests we have
[16:10:17] <johnbender> to make sure there aren't regressions
[16:10:40] <johnbender> this is going to be a little but tricky because we want something fairly objective in terms of cpu utilization etc
[16:10:51] <johnbender> maybe we can do it in browserstack or some such
[16:11:01] <johnbender> though I'm not sure how that works if you have a "bad neighbor"

[16:22:14] <gseguin> all of you?
[16:22:33] <jlembeck> I believe so, might need to double-check with Wilto or scottjehl______ on that
[16:22:38] <gseguin> it's a conspiracy! I think they're having their own jQCon
[16:23:51] <jlembeck> Maybe we are, maybe we're not.
