[08:35:01] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: you guys around?
[08:36:49] <Wilto> johnbender: Sorta. Snow-shoveling out my inbox. Whassup?
[08:36:55] <Wilto> And I can throw stuff at Todd, if need be.
[08:37:02] <Wilto> Or just for fun.
[08:46:40] <johnbender> Wilto: just wondering if I should persevere with the iPhone "double transition"
[08:48:46] <johnbender> otherwise I'm going to futz with the reflow issue in ics
[09:29:39] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:37:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender, Wilto, gseguin: Do you guys know what the consensus is on .attr( "disabled", ... ) vs. .prop( "disabled", ... )?
[09:37:41] <_|Nix|_> checkboxradio uses .prop, whereas the other form widgets use .attr ...
[09:39:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if its a truthy value it should be prop according to the jquery docs
[09:39:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, it's true/false ...
[09:40:08] <johnbender> then it should probably be prop
[09:40:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: but that assumes that the dom element has a .disabled
[09:40:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... which all form elements have, right?
[09:41:08] * johnbender goes to check the spec
[09:41:30] <_|Nix|_> Talking button, select, slider, and textinput ...
[09:41:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_:  BUTTON, INPUT, OPTGROUP, OPTION, SELECT, and TEXTAREA.
[09:41:52] <johnbender> according to the spec
[09:42:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Then I think it's OK to replace grep -n '\.attr( "disabled' js/*js with .prop ...

[09:42:48] <_|Nix|_> 18:46:40 < johnbender> Wilto: just wondering if I should persevere with the iPhone "double transition"
[09:42:52] <_|Nix|_> 18:48:47 < johnbender> otherwise I'm going to futz with the reflow issue in ics
[09:43:08] <Wilto> Woah, hi, sorry.
[09:43:10] <_|Nix|_> Sorry ... daughter got to my keyboard ...
[09:43:25] <johnbender> we won't merge it in until after the release though
[09:43:48] <johnbender> and we'll have to take a look at each
[09:44:11] <johnbender> Wilto: having a super hard time getting ics to reflow these damn headers and footers :(
[09:44:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ... NP ... I'll submit it and we go from there ... can't do it until about 6 hrs from now, anyway ...
[09:51:54] <Wilto> johnbender: Refresh my memory; this is just ICS native browser?
[09:51:59] <Wilto> Not PhoneGap or the like?
[09:59:40] <johnbender> Wilto: yah
[09:59:54] <johnbender> it's reproducible in the native browser
[10:00:28] <johnbender> Wilto: here's a shocker, removing the position: fixed solves the issue :(
[10:01:54] <johnbender> http://jsbin.com/ixeyey/12
[10:01:55] <johnbender> works
[10:02:05] <johnbender> http://jsbin.com/ixeyey/9
[10:02:06] <johnbender> doesn't
[10:16:35] <johnbender> Wilto: hahah
[10:16:40] <johnbender> I've got something at least
[10:16:46] * johnbender thanks the lord
[10:17:39] <Wilto> son of a
[10:19:03] <johnbender> Wilto: at the very least replacing the inner content of the headers with the inner content of the headers given a short delay appears to solve the issue
[10:19:12] <johnbender> so it appears to be a reflow problem
[10:19:23] <johnbender> going to try your suggestion
[10:19:30] <johnbender> document.innerHtml
[10:19:37] <johnbender> with the delay
[10:19:46] <johnbender> (it didn't work without it)
[10:22:27] <Wilto> Remember that nukes bindings, though, I think.
[10:23:46] <Wilto> And is this a 0’d setTimeout thing?
[10:23:51] <Wilto> Or a legit delay is needed?
[10:24:49] <johnbender> legit delay
[10:34:23] <johnbender> Wilto: looks like 250 ms is the fastest it can be to work
[10:34:29] <Wilto> …
[10:34:30] <Wilto> wat
[10:34:39] <johnbender> all I'm doing is replacing the the deepest child with itself
[10:35:05] <johnbender> not quite sure what else to do
[10:35:16] <johnbender> this is definitely out of my wheelhouse
[10:39:34] <Wilto> I will regret this completely:
[10:39:38] <Wilto> Lemme at that sucker.
[10:39:43] <Wilto> Oh, wait.
[10:39:48] <Wilto> You have the ICS phone now. Hell.
[10:40:32] <Wilto> …Try this:
[10:40:34] <Wilto> Just humor me.
[10:40:50] <Wilto> Wrap the fixed element(s) in div(s).
[10:40:56] <Wilto> And set them to opacity: .9;
[10:42:11] <Wilto> Note: http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQnai3fw8kwlhAz6C0WPa1P44TgoU3bYhtVCNPE-VceO48U0bCa-2HFjFEgUg
[10:43:05] * johnbender goes to try it
[10:47:46] <johnbender> Wilto: no change
[10:47:56] <johnbender> Wilto: http://jsbin.com/ixeyey/25
[10:48:00] <Wilto> Damn.
[10:48:07] <johnbender> the input is for the delay
[10:48:14] <johnbender> on replacing the header contents
[10:48:37] <johnbender> just anything at all to force a reflow
[10:48:49] <johnbender> I need to order some lunch/breakfast
[10:49:43] <johnbender> Dominos being delivered to the Intercontinental
[10:50:25] <Wilto> Niiice.
[10:50:45] <Wilto> Okay. Let’s think weird-ass Android.
[10:51:09] <Wilto> If they’re visible, is it still happening? visibility: hidden; vs. display: none;
[10:51:30] <Wilto> If they’re _native_ fixed, without any of our additional data-position="fixed" shenanigans, does it still happen?
[10:53:02] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jqueryui: Its been seven months since 1.9m6. Time for 1.9m7! http://t.co/YxqtH8qf Accordion redesign is done, tons of other improvements. ★ http://bit.ly/Hfi24u
[10:53:45] <Wilto> If there’s a set height/width on the fixed element, does it happen?
[10:54:07] <johnbender> Wilto: checking
[10:54:25] <Wilto> Alternately, if we remove whatever width is set. And both of the above, but if empty?
[10:54:42] <Wilto> Just throwing out some of the stuff I’d try in voodooland.
[10:56:10] <Wilto> These things couldn’t seem more unrelated, but somehow they are when it comes to Android’s position: fixed;
[10:57:59] <johnbender> Wilto: neither of those appear sto make any difference
[10:58:02] <Wilto> And finally—so help me:
[10:58:31] <Wilto> If you set the next sibling of the fixed element to position: absolute—despite what that may do to the layout, for now—does it fix it?
[11:00:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/gORw0A
[11:00:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added metadata for bundle builder - Ghislain Seguin
[11:00:35] <Wilto> A fixed thing seems to break positioning context all around it, at least in older Android.
[11:01:04] <johnbender> Wilto: no dice there either
[11:01:08] <Wilto> Dammit.
[11:01:11] <Wilto> display: none?
[11:01:19] <Wilto> On the fixed thing? Did that “solve” the bug?
[11:03:03] <Wilto> Also: same issue when you set, like, style="position: fixed;" and remove the data-position="fixed"?
[11:07:16] <Wilto> …That 250ms delay seems odd.
[11:07:33] <Wilto> And sounds like it’s somewhere near what we’re using for the transitions.
[11:08:04] <johnbender> Wilto: position: fixed; and width: 100% still fail
[11:08:45] <Wilto> Goddamned Android.
[11:08:55] <Wilto> Chrome can’t come fast enough.
[11:10:58] <Wilto> I hate to say this, but it might be worth setting up a test case outside of jQM so we can nail down the underlying issue.
[11:11:08] <Wilto> Granted that ain’t easy, here.
[11:13:16] <Wilto> johnbender: Try this sucker: http://jsbin.com/ixeyey/40
[11:13:40] <Wilto> I know I’ve found Android issues with 2D transforms and fixed without a parent opacity.
[11:14:05] <Wilto> Or this: http://jsbin.com/ixeyey/41
[11:14:18] <johnbender> nope
[11:14:29] <Wilto> Hm.
[11:14:45] <Wilto> Okay. Try breaking the transition itself—replace the translate with “scale” or something.
[11:15:00] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm going to boil it down
[11:15:02] <Wilto> If `scale` doesn’t fire at all, it’s related to the thing I found.
[11:15:10] <toddparker> i warned you that taking that phone was nothing but trouble
[11:15:20] <Wilto> It’s cuuuursed!
[11:15:25] * johnbender shrug - it's just work
[11:15:38] <Wilto> You say that now. While you’re still sane.
[11:15:58] <toddparker> silent scroll timing throwing this off maybe?
[11:16:53] <kinblas> Wilto: lol
[11:17:37] <Wilto> toddparker: Yeah, that 250ms thing…
[11:19:18] <toddparker> i feel like when you scroll the page, you can't nail down when the scroll is complete
[11:19:31] <toddparker> that causes some blinkiness in our transitions too
[11:19:46] <kinblas> toddparker: silentScroll has a callback on it
[11:20:02] <kinblas> I added it for toolbars 1.5 years ago
[11:20:31] <kinblas> if it's silentScroll that is causing the problem, then you can register a callback on it to let you know after the scroll was set
[11:20:36] <kinblas> so you know it's all done
[11:21:51] <Wilto> johnbender: Have you tried threatening the phone with physical violence?
[11:22:47] <Wilto> Jumping on a call; back soon.
[11:27:27] <Wilto> johnbender: Dude. Thought of something.
[11:27:45] <johnbender> Wilto: ?
[11:28:08] <Wilto> Nuke silentScroll altogether. Android freezes everything during scroll, right? I wonder if, timing wise, things are still locked up from the silentScrollin’ when they ought not be?
[11:30:05] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.transition.js#L47
[11:30:10] <johnbender> we might want to use that callback there
[11:30:19] <johnbender> for serializing the transition after scroll

[11:36:27] <Wilto> Like Arkham Asylum up in here.
[11:39:37] <Wilto> Yeeeah, it’s test case time. Maybe just two divs, each with a button that transitions from the current one to the other one. Then slap a position: fixed; thing in one or both.
[11:39:39] <Wilto> Sucks, man.
[11:44:34] <johnbender> yah I'll try and get it boiled down after lunch
[11:44:53] <johnbender> jqm appears to be applying the "slidedown" class to the fixed header

[12:39:34] <johnbender> Wilto: http://jsbin.com/ewivap/36/edit
[12:39:36] <johnbender> getting there
[12:39:42] <johnbender> that still reproduces the issue
[12:41:11] <johnbender> gseguin: you have a galaxy nexus right?
[12:42:06] <gseguin> my coworker does
[12:42:21] <gseguin> I have a Galaxy Vibrant
[12:43:21] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[12:43:25] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[12:43:32] <johnbender> I need some external verification
[12:43:36] <johnbender> http://jsbin.com/ewivap/36
[12:43:58] <johnbender> loading in portrait and then rotatin to landscape should see the black block remain the same size
[12:44:05] <johnbender> a touch should then resize it
[12:44:23] <johnbender> gseguin: ICS only it seems
[12:45:04] <johnbender> version ...
[12:45:29] * gseguin tries
[12:45:38] <johnbender> version 4.0.1
[12:46:21] <gseguin> yep behaves as described
[12:46:24] <gseguin> 4.0.2
[12:46:28] <johnbender> mother fucker
[12:46:32] <johnbender> well
[12:46:36] <johnbender> at least I know it's not just my phone
[12:46:38] <johnbender> that's good
[12:47:16] <gseguin> anything else you need me to look at?
[12:47:29] <johnbender> gseguin: nope that was helpful though, thanks
[12:47:44] <gseguin> sure thing
[12:57:03] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: http://jsbin.com/ewivap/51/edit
[12:57:05] <johnbender> and there you have it
[12:57:16] <johnbender> if I remove the inital scale value from the viewport meta tag
[12:57:20] <johnbender> it stops happening
[12:58:25] <johnbender> but that's only because the width doesn't change
[13:05:07] <Wilto> …
[13:05:20] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/argh.gif
[13:07:17] <johnbender> gseguin: did you test on the galaxy nexus of the galaxy vibrant
[13:07:29] <gseguin> the nexus
[13:09:17] <johnbender> http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=27959&thanks=27959&ts=1332965352
[13:10:08] <johnbender> http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=27959
[13:10:11] <johnbender> better link
[13:12:01] <toddparker> fun times
[13:13:07] <toddparker> johnbender: i think the slide down css on the footer happens because the tap to show/hide uses the slide up/down to animate them in/out
[13:13:10] <toddparker> a guess
[13:25:18] <johnbender> toddparker: doesn't matter anyway
[13:25:26] <johnbender> toddparker: http://jsbin.com/ewivap/51/edit
[13:25:31] <johnbender> that's all it takes
[13:31:08] <gseguin> johnbender: so  is that supposed to resize the header on orientation change?
[13:35:32] <johnbender> gseguin: which?
[13:35:36] <johnbender> that jsbin?
[13:35:47] <gseguin> yeah
[13:36:00] <johnbender> gseguin: no, but this one will http://jsbin.com/ixeyey/55/edit
[13:36:06] <johnbender> in so far as it causes a reflow
[13:36:14] <johnbender> I didn't take much time to make sure that was a good solution
[13:36:20] <gseguin> yeah that's the one I just tried
[13:36:21] <johnbender> I don't think we should incorporate this into the librray
[13:36:23] <johnbender> ah
[13:36:27] <johnbender> it works for me! :D
[13:36:38] <johnbender> gseguin: you might need to increase the timeout
[13:36:44] <gseguin> wait I'll try again
[13:38:26] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/Y0vvhg

[13:39:03] <Wilto> The two smallest fixes ever are now in master.
[13:43:08] <gseguin> oh ok so http://jsbin.com/ixeyey/57/edit did work
[13:43:35] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[13:45:33] <Wilto> johnbender: If you’re seeing this in a totally non-jQM-context, there might not be a hell of a lot we can do.
[13:45:48] <Wilto> Other than update the docs like I did with the other position: fixed/Android chaos.
[13:48:52] <johnbender> Wilto: yah I posted a bug to the android list
[13:49:09] <johnbender> gseguin: wtf
[13:49:11] <johnbender> a whole second?
[13:49:14] <johnbender> jesus
[13:49:43] <gseguin> I didn't test below but 250 wasn't working for me
[13:50:13] <johnbender> gseguin: another 50ms might be the diff
[13:50:38] <gseguin> johnbender: it's possible
[13:51:33] <johnbender> Wilto: what's funny is that the docs don't suffer from this issue, I'm guessing because something else in the page is causing a reflow
[13:52:24] <johnbender> alright
[13:52:26] <johnbender> I'm going to the gym
[13:52:34] <johnbender> need to work my head back into shape
