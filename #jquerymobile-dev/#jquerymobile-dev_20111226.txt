[12:54:24] <garann> although sanity isn't my strong suit..

[13:03:08] <garann> ah, cool
[13:59:21] <Wilto> Captain’s log. Stardate, uh, December 26th.
[13:59:39] <Wilto> I’ve realized that we’re looking at Android’s redraw issues backwards, with regards to slide transitions.
[14:00:43] <Wilto> We’ve been looking for a way of avoiding them to improve framerate, when the real issue is that our transforms cause the rendering engine to take a “snapshot” of the page, move that, then re-render it from scratch post-animation.
[14:00:50] <Wilto> This is why it’s blinking.
[14:01:55] <Wilto> By moving back to using left/right absolute positioning, we’re triggering constant redraws which don’t make the animation much choppier—I mean, it can only get so terrible—but do remove the blinking pre/post animation.
[14:02:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto created slide-transition-experimental (+1 new commit): http://git.io/LK2e5w
[14:02:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/slide-transition-experimental] First pass at revamping slide transitions on Android. Still pretty rough around the edges, but mostly blink-free. - Mat Marquis
[14:03:48] <Wilto> That branch definitely needs more work and the CSS is a little sloppy, but testing on Honeycomb and 2.3 I’m getting no blinking.
