[10:02:25] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ when you get a chance can you run `grunt lint` from an updated master
[10:02:30] <johnbender> sigh
[10:02:34] <johnbender> anyhow
[10:02:45] <johnbender> there are a ton of mixed tabs and spaces in there
[10:02:56] <johnbender> I was wondering if you wouldn't mind addressing that :D
[10:03:10] <johnbender> if I get done with the other files before I hear back I'll do it
[10:06:07] <toddparker> johnbender: are you on the tech lead call?
[10:06:16] <johnbender> toddparker: nope, but I should be :(
[10:13:34] <toddparker> thanks!

[10:37:18] <toddparker> anne - could you meet re: site re-templating later today?
[10:37:22] <toddparker> with richard
[10:37:28] <toddparker> agcolom ^^
[11:00:07] <toddparker> hi uGoMobi
[11:00:13] <toddparker> looking at the 1.1.1 bugs
[11:00:24] <uGoMobi> hi toddparker
[11:00:32] <toddparker> looks like the update padding and fixed headers are going to need some love from you
[11:00:53] <toddparker> did you get what you need re: testing those navbar rounding issue?
[11:01:04] <toddparker> BTW - Andrew is an intern here
[11:01:18] <toddparker> thus the thorough testing
[11:02:05] <toddparker> JasonDScott: can you look at this one today?
[11:02:06] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4176
[11:02:07] <uGoMobi> toddparker: need to hear from JasonDScott and we need to test again on WP7/7.5 and some iOS
[11:02:14] <toddparker> ok
[11:02:26] <toddparker> until then i guess we can back burner this
[11:02:43] <uGoMobi> I already started with updatePagePadding, just fixed one
[11:02:47] <toddparker> cool
[11:03:00] <uGoMobi> have a question though
[11:03:15] <toddparker> we have Zach the intern here tomorrow so if you send me urls and issues for whatever you want tested, I'll have him test tomorrow
[11:03:17] <toddparker> sure...
[11:03:31] <uGoMobi> what was the idea behind making updatePagePadding an option?
[11:04:04] <uGoMobi> i.e. why can it be set to false
[11:04:24] <toddparker> i guess so you could hard code the CSS padding and avoid al the re-calcualtions
[11:04:28] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4223
[11:04:36] <toddparker> we have it calc because the height are so variable
[11:05:33] <uGoMobi> that issue is about that updatePagePadding is always called on pageshow, even when set to false
[11:05:43] <toddparker> i just asked scott jehl to weigh in on that issue
[11:05:51] <toddparker> that is clearly a bug
[11:05:56] <toddparker> i think
[11:07:01] <uGoMobi> i will create a test page containing changes from PR of MauriceG
[11:07:11] <uGoMobi> so Andrew or Zach can test it
[11:09:14] <MauriceG> Hi everyone!
[11:09:22] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[11:09:33] <uGoMobi> 35 minutes to go Maurice ;-)
[11:09:50] <MauriceG> Yes !!  is the beer cold??
[11:09:58] <uGoMobi> all prepaired
[11:12:52] <uGoMobi> MauriceG / MauriceG_: do you still have test page for this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4260 ?
[11:12:53] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1m, 1w ago): Suggestion: Fix for fixed persistent toolbar padding issues
[11:13:49] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: that's the fiddle for
[11:14:43] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: sorry, what fiddle? did i miss something?
[11:15:29] <MauriceG> it seems, I've some trouble with mIRC ...
[11:15:51] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: the FOT's fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/jVKyS/

[11:17:46] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: thanks! can you post that link in a comment at the PR?
[11:18:31] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ^^^ MauriceG has test page. Can you have it tested?
[11:20:07] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: done
[11:20:22] <uGoMobi> cool thanks MauriceG
[11:21:06] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: but the patched jquery.mobile.fixedToolbar.js is own hosted
[11:22:01] <MauriceG> I took latest from yesterday and made the changes from the PR
[11:24:03] <uGoMobi> ok, we need a test page containing your fix so the iterns at Filament Group can test it
[11:24:28] <uGoMobi> thanks for that
[11:24:52] <MauriceG> the file can be loaded from http://test.jqmobile.de/js/jquery.mobile.fixedToolbar.js
[11:25:49] <uGoMobi> i can't see that in the fiddle
[11:26:07] <MauriceG> what do you not see?
[11:26:56] <MauriceG> the fiddle loads the index.php from that page ...
[11:27:42] <MauriceG> and the js files getting combinded than
[11:27:50] <uGoMobi> ah ok now I get it
[11:27:53] <MauriceG> than/then
[11:28:03] <uGoMobi> thought that index.php was somethings else
[11:28:11] <uGoMobi> then it's all cool
[11:28:20] <MauriceG> no, it's just like in the docs
[11:28:32] <uGoMobi> as long as the adjusted js code is loaded
[11:28:55] <MauriceG> yes, so it is..
[11:29:01] <uGoMobi> yeah i see it now... was looking for fixedToolbar.js
[11:29:08] <uGoMobi> ok great
[11:29:32] <uGoMobi> we can put that suggestion of gseguin in later
[11:30:11] <uGoMobi> or did you already change that in your code? didn't see commit for it

[12:18:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup] Prevent jump to 0 between popups - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:18:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup] Do not worry so much about keeping focus inside the popup. Instead, handle the case where the user tries to open the same popup while it is already open. - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:29:19] <_|Nix|_> So, is there a multiple-choice list example somewhere? i.e., the same thing that would go into a multiple-choice select, but on a page?
[12:57:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: AMBUSH!
[12:57:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: would you mind running `grunt lint` ?
[12:57:52] <johnbender> the popup file has some whitespace stuff
[12:58:01] <johnbender> and I'm almost finished with everything else
[12:58:06] <johnbender> that is, run it when you get a chance
[12:59:29] <agcolom> hey gseguin, you're ok?
[13:00:03] <agcolom> hi every one :-)
[13:01:53] <agcolom> hey _|Nix|_ I came across something weir today with popups...
[13:02:38] <agcolom> weird ^
[13:04:31] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[13:05:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I don't have grunt ...
[13:05:43] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What happened?
[13:06:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you have node installed you can do an `npm install` and then `node node_modules/.bin/grunt lint`
[13:06:34] <johnbender> if not, we have docs :D
[13:06:48] <agcolom> I couldn't launch a popup unless the popup was in the page that had the link...
[13:06:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile#buildcustomization
[13:07:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Not surprising ... the popup is not created if it's not already present ...
[13:08:02] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: However, I might add a if-it's-not-created-then-create-it clause to the click handler.
[13:08:20] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... and then it should work.
[13:08:35] <agcolom> yes, sorry, before I could have a div with data-role="popup" that was outside everything.
[13:08:59] <agcolom> and launch it from a div data-role=page on the same file
[13:09:41] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Really? I had that? Hmmmm ... OK, well, I guess I better bring that back.
[13:09:55] <agcolom> but it seems that now the div data-role="popup" has to be in the div data-role="page" that contains the link with data-rel="popup" to the popup div
[13:10:18] <agcolom> I did a jsfiddle... I'm trying to find it back...
[13:14:14] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ http://jsfiddle.net/agcolom/Au9zy/16/
[13:14:25] <agcolom> popup 2 does not work
[13:14:44] <agcolom> it is outside of the page... but I thought that used to work...
[13:14:52] <agcolom> Maybe I'm wrong....
[13:16:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can I restrict my linting to one file?
[13:18:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: not as far as I know
[13:18:07] <johnbender> it should be at the bottom of the lint
[13:18:10] <johnbender> and it goes fast enough
[13:18:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ... how does it expect me to format conditionals?
[13:18:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: tabs only
[13:18:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It complains about something else: Bad line breaking before '?'.
[13:19:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What's wrong with condition\n\t? then-part;\n\t: else-part;
[13:19:29] <johnbender> use an if statement in that case
[13:19:48] <_|Nix|_> It's in a variable declaration ...
[13:19:57] <johnbender> it doesn't need to be ...
[13:20:28] <johnbender> this ternary opperator cascading / cleverness stuff is insanity imo
[13:20:32] <johnbender> they have a lot of it in core too
[13:20:39] <johnbender> no offense
[13:21:19] <johnbender> good 'ol if and else is easy for anyone to understand
[13:23:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Having an if-statement with only one line in the block adds a lot of extra code for no reason.
[13:23:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: imo, using the ternary operator is unreadable
[13:23:33] <johnbender> which is a good reason for the extra code
[13:24:05] <johnbender> using the ternary operator in this case is unreadable
[13:24:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Think about this: if ( x ) { callFunction( parm1, parm2, parm3, 4, parm5 ); } else { callFunction( parm1, parm2, parm3, 9, parm5 ); }
[13:24:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Is that really worth it?
[13:24:24] <johnbender> yes!
[13:24:30] <johnbender> that's exactly what I'm saying
[13:24:53] <johnbender> even with the contrived example you've provided
[13:25:11] <johnbender> ( ( $.mobile.urlHistory.activeIndex === 0 ) ? $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition : activeEntry.transition ),
[13:25:25] <johnbender> looks okish on a single line
[13:25:34] <johnbender> if( $.mobile.urlHistory.activeIndex === 0 ) {
[13:25:50] <johnbender>   dstTransition = $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition;
[13:25:56] <johnbender> } else {
[13:26:05] <johnbender>   dstTransition = activeEntry.transition;
[13:26:06] <johnbender> }
[13:26:13] <johnbender> is rediculously simple to understand
[13:27:25] <_|Nix|_> OK, so while we're at it, check a couple of lines up (parsedDst).
[13:28:07] <johnbender> yah, it'd be nice to stay under 100 lines too
[13:28:33] <_|Nix|_> What should stay under 100 lines?
[13:28:36] <_|Nix|_> The function body?
[13:28:46] <johnbender> err
[13:28:48] <johnbender> 100 characters
[13:28:53] <johnbender> the parseDst assignment
[13:29:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I can switch that one to an if-statement as well ...
[13:29:53] <johnbender> yar
[13:35:02] <gseguin> hey agcolom, I'm fine just sick
[13:35:24] <johnbender> gseguin: is one sick bastard
[13:35:38] <johnbender> "Things to Think and not Say"
[13:35:48] <gseguin> :)
[13:35:51] <johnbender> ... "Which are only Maybe Funny""
[13:36:07] <_|Nix|_> "I calls 'em like I sees 'em - whale biologist!"
[13:37:09] <agcolom> gseguin. really sorry to hear :-(
[13:38:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Not really sure I'd like to get rid of this conditional:
[13:38:41] <_|Nix|_> 			var coords = self._placementCoords(
[13:38:41] <_|Nix|_> 					( undefined === x ? window.innerWidth / 2 : x ),
[13:38:41] <_|Nix|_> 					( undefined === y ? window.innerHeight / 2 : y ) );
[13:38:49] <agcolom> like flu or more like eaten something not right or stomac bug?? My trick with flu like or cold is VitaminC and Zinc!!! Really works.... No flu for me all winter... And I'm talking English Winter and taking public transport with lots of sick people everyday!
[13:39:33] <_|Nix|_> This would ballong quite a bit and require me to declare two more variables.
[13:39:38] <agcolom> And plenty of sleep ;-)
[13:39:41] <_|Nix|_> s/ballong/balloon/
[13:41:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://gist.github.com/824f408aa335694c5731
[13:41:11] <johnbender> ?
[13:41:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Again, two variables declared for absolutely no reason.
[13:42:15] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you need to put it on one line to pass the linter then do that
[13:42:24] <johnbender> we need to get linting into the build
[13:42:52] <johnbender> whatever works for you is fine as long as it passes
[13:44:44] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[13:49:07] <_|Nix|_> Bah! This is just terrible: Bad line breaking before '&&'.
[13:49:44] <_|Nix|_> It wants the && to go to the end of the line. Why? Things look much better when each line in a long list of conditions starts with && ...
[13:50:19] <_|Nix|_> The other way around, you get lines with different lengths each ending in && and not having any apparent connection :(
[13:51:07] <_|Nix|_> This would have us get rid of a really nice way to format an otherwise complex statement.
