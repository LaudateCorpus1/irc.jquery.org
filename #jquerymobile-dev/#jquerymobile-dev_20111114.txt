[06:47:13] <toddmparker_> hey all
[07:15:47] <Wilto> ’Morning, guys.
[08:49:23] <toddmparker_> so since we're shooting for this to go out at 3 or 4 EST today, pencils down by 1:00 EST - about an hour from now
[08:50:04] <toddmparker_> I'd like to have everyone doing lots of testing today - just run through the demos & docs on as many devices as you can. Try every page. Bang on things and see if you see any showstoppers.
[08:50:12] <Wilto> Got that list theme inheritance thing fixed; just wading through the test suite now.
[08:50:34] <johnbender> Wilto: where did you end up puting that test?
[08:50:39] <toddmparker_> johnbender, kinblas - you guys online?
[08:50:44] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender
[08:50:57] <kinblas> toddmparker_: nope
[08:51:05] <kinblas> toddmparker_: j/k
[08:51:07] <johnbender> toddmparker_: same
[08:51:20] <Wilto> Saying “test suite” is like saying Beetlejuice three times, but instead it summons johnbender.
[08:51:27] <johnbender> :D
[08:52:37] <Wilto> Uh, I was thinking …/tests/listview/listview_core.js, just above the “rounded corners” test.
[08:52:54] <toddmparker_> now i picture bender wearing that beetlejuice suit
[08:53:46] <kinblas> toddmparker_: Wilto: you guys see my note on the listview inhertiance patch?
[08:54:01] <Wilto> kinblas: Yes indeed—I just added those lines manually, but outside the loop.
[08:54:17] <Wilto> And set the default theme to “null”, which I don’t think was in the PR.
[08:54:33] <johnbender> Wilto: sounds good
[08:54:46] <kinblas> Wilto: ok,  think Maurice was questioning the listview theme idea
[08:54:48] <kinblas> but I replied
[08:55:32] <Wilto> Hey, any chance one of you wants to tag in on writing the associated test? I’m 100% new to QUnit, and  an hour before RC3 probably isn’t the best time for me to start banging my head against it.
[08:56:17] <Wilto> I’m thinking I’m better off spending the hour testing on the various and sundry Filament gadgets.
[08:58:32] <toddmparker_> +1
[08:58:44] <toddmparker_> johnbender - can you take a look at testing that?
[08:59:00] <toddmparker_> i want Wilto to test a zillion devices today
[08:59:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sho can
[08:59:17] <Wilto> ?hi5 johnbender
[08:59:17] <bot-t1> ⁵ johnbender
[08:59:21] <toddmparker_> you're the best
[08:59:52] <toddmparker_> kinblas and johnbender - do you think I should move the BB call today? Any burning Q's for them?
[08:59:54] <johnbender> Wilto:  are all your changes pushed?
[09:00:02] <Wilto> Thirty seconds.
[09:00:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I haven't seen invites for any of those meetings actually
[09:00:16] <johnbender> which means I'm prone to scheduling screw ups :(
[09:00:16] <kinblas> toddmparker_: other than can we have devices for testing? :-)
[09:00:20] <kinblas> none frome me
[09:00:25] <kinblas> from
[09:00:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'd like to know when we'll see a BBX BlackBerry bold
[09:00:45] <johnbender> uh
[09:00:47] <johnbender> for testing that is
[09:00:54] <johnbender> :P
[09:00:59] <toddmparker_> yeah, right?
[09:01:08] <toddmparker_> i just send an invite to you guys
[09:01:13] <Wilto> For a second there, I was afraid you were confessing to being a BlackBerry user.
[09:01:26] <toddmparker_> there is that msft call today too, but that is just to demo some tool
[09:01:26] <johnbender> my next phone will not likely be an android
[09:01:32] <toddmparker_> think it will be a quickie (hope)
[09:01:43] <toddmparker_> i can handle it if you don't want the time sink
[09:01:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did I miss the invite for that too?
[09:01:59] <toddmparker_> if we met with BB next week, we could talk about plans for 1.1.
[09:02:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I think it's a dev tool so it would be good to see how they are using it
[09:03:18] <Wilto> Paging commitbot. Come in, commitbot.
[09:03:24] <toddmparker_> ok, do you have the invite?

[09:03:44] <Wilto> There you are, you little scamp.
[09:03:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: don't think so :(
[09:06:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I totally lied I do have the BB meeting in my calendar
[09:06:01] <johnbender> awesome
[09:06:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: when is the MS meeting today?
[09:09:15] <toddmparker_> 3pm est / noon for you
[09:11:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: much obliged
[09:16:27] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so I've been toying with another change that shaves 700ms off WP7.5 (listview 400) and 200ms off iPad
[09:16:34] <kinblas> you want me to wait for 1.1?
[09:16:59] <johnbender> kinblas: how big is the diff? :D
[09:17:21] <kinblas> johnbender: the last line of the for-loop
[09:17:38] <kinblas> is where we set itemClass on the list item and it's btn children
[09:17:38] <johnbender> I say go for it if we can get it into the rc toda
[09:17:40] <johnbender> *today
[09:17:50] <kinblas> all I'm doing is stuffing it in a dictionary
[09:17:58] <kinblas> and doing one or 2 of the same calls after the loop
[09:18:07] <kinblas> so we reduce the function call count by at least 400+

[09:19:17] <kinblas> ipad goes from 1424ms 862ms
[09:19:30] * kinblas hits the below 1 second mark :-D
[09:19:34] <Wilto> Then my vote is “damn the torpedoes; full speed ahead.”

[09:24:10] <johnbender> kinblas: on the super long list page?
[09:24:41] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: Wilto: will you guys hit the per test page when you do your testing on the phones?
[09:24:49] <johnbender> s/per/perf/
[09:25:04] <johnbender> I'd like to see many possible data points :D
[09:25:13] <johnbender> -possible
[09:25:20] <kinblas> johnbender: I did that on friday/saturday
[09:25:30] <kinblas> but the chart didn't show more than one bar
[09:27:41] * johnbender sighs
[09:27:43] <johnbender> I'll go take a look
[09:27:59] <kinblas> so the change I made looks good, I ran through all the listview samples
[09:28:04] <kinblas> and they are all look the same
[09:28:09] <kinblas> I'm going to generate some numbers
[09:28:19] <kinblas> and then consider landing it after I have facts for you guys
[09:29:44] <Wilto> johnbender: Sure thing, man.
[09:31:11] <toddmparker_> kinblas: i say go for it
[09:31:19] <toddmparker_> even if it invalidates all my charts
[09:31:36] <toddmparker_> i can add a little "breaking update: we shaved even more"
[09:31:45] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ok
[09:32:10] <toddmparker_> but other than that speedup and the listview inheritance, let's just look at testing
[09:37:26] <Wilto> johnbender: Am I testing the 400-item list on everything? http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/speed/lists-ul-record.php
[09:38:43] <Wilto> Wait, sorry, looks like.
[09:38:47] <johnbender> Wilto: if you like
[09:38:53] <johnbender> Wilto: one sec
[09:38:54] <Wilto> Oh but I do.

[10:23:12] <kinblas> heh
[10:24:58] <toddmparker_> kinblas: pong
[10:25:17] <toddmparker_> nice kinblas
[10:25:29] <kinblas> toddmparker_: nevermind, I was going to ask if you wanted me to re-do the RC2 numbers
[10:25:41] <kinblas> but I already started, so we can compare the "TOTAL" changepage time
[10:25:46] <kinblas> which is what the user percieves
[10:25:49] <kinblas> btw
[10:25:59] <kinblas> I think we are so fast now that rendering is becoming a factor
[10:26:02] <kinblas> in the blinkiness
[10:26:03] <toddmparker_> nice
[10:26:10] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[10:26:10] <kinblas> what I'm seeing
[10:26:21] <kinblas> is that our animation timer is firing
[10:26:25] <kinblas> before the animation finishes
[10:26:32] <toddmparker_> interesting
[10:26:43] <kinblas> the animation timer is the thing we use just in case there is no to animation
[10:26:52] <toddmparker_> so we have a timer set to the css timing but they aren't in sync
[10:26:57] <kinblas> right
[10:27:03] <kinblas> the rendering becomes delayed
[10:27:06] <kinblas> so the animation is delayed
[10:27:09] <kinblas> which gives our timer some time
[10:27:10] <kinblas> to fire
[10:27:15] * kinblas sighs
[10:27:19] <toddmparker_> fun
[10:27:29] <kinblas> anyways I'll have new numbers in about 10 minutes
[10:27:32] <toddmparker_> ok
[10:27:33] <kinblas> they are oh so good
[10:27:41] <kinblas> toddmparker_: if you don't mind
[10:27:45] <toddmparker_> starting tomorrow, i want to staying playing with transitions for 1.1
[10:27:54] <kinblas> could you step through the list docs and just eyeball things to see if anything looks different?
[10:27:58] <kinblas> I did, but I want another set of eyes
[10:28:07] <toddmparker_> ok
[10:28:16] <kinblas> nothing should look different :-P
[10:28:19] <toddmparker_> Wilto: can you keep your eyes peeled too
[10:28:27] <toddmparker_> fingers crossed
[10:28:37] <Wilto> Sir, yes sir!
[10:29:11] <Wilto> My eyes are crossed and my fingers are pealed.
[10:29:46] <johnbender> toddmparker_: any thoughts on perf and version numbers?
[10:30:02] <johnbender> kinblas: ^
[10:30:13] <toddmparker_> whatcha mean johnbender
[10:30:24] <johnbender> right now android is divided up by the patch version
[10:30:51] <toddmparker_> you mean how granular should we report perf
[10:30:54] <johnbender> the stats are aggregated by Android 2.x.y right now
[10:30:55] <johnbender> yah
[10:31:00] <toddmparker_> 2.3.1 vs. 2.3.2
[10:31:03] <johnbender> should it just be grouped by the minor version
[10:31:04] <johnbender> ?
[10:31:06] <toddmparker_> or just roll it into 2.3.x
[10:31:13] <kinblas> that's a nightmare
[10:31:18] <kinblas> the hardware is different too
[10:31:29] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm punting on the hardware
[10:31:40] <toddmparker_> i think rolling up by minor version is enough
[10:31:44] <johnbender> I'm not even sure how you would do that
[10:31:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kk
[10:31:53] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah but 2.3 on a Droid X will be much slower than on a Thunderbolt
[10:32:03] <toddmparker_> sure
[10:32:13] <toddmparker_> it'll average out tho
[10:32:20] <toddmparker_> most android devices can't be upgraded
[10:32:20] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: well
[10:32:22] <johnbender> sort of
[10:32:27] <toddmparker_> you're marooned on a version when you guy it
[10:32:29] <johnbender> kinblas: maybe we should choose devices
[10:32:32] <johnbender> to get accurate numbers
[10:33:07] <toddmparker_> could we roll up for now, but remember to give this a look once we have more data to see the distribution patterns?
[10:33:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: maybe you could post-it note a device with each version in your "labe"
[10:33:15] <johnbender> "lab"
[10:33:36] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah, I guess that's my point ... in order to get meaningful numbers they have to be aggregated by like hardware
[10:33:43] <kinblas> and OS
[10:33:46] <toddmparker_> meaning having one device per platform we test regularly
[10:33:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah
[10:33:56] <toddmparker_> we could do that
[10:34:22] <toddmparker_> i just wonder if we're over-complicating for now
[10:37:48] <kinblas> toddmparker_: if we're ok with numbers that land somewhere between 1st gen and 2nd gen hardware for now?
[10:56:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: are we doing the bb call?
[10:58:23] <Wilto> Haven’t heard back from Laurent yet.
[11:00:01] <Wilto> Todd’s just finishing up another call now—one sec.
[11:03:39] <Wilto> He’s dialing in now; I’ll give you guys a heads-up if we should all call in.
[11:05:43] <toddmparker_> off the hook
[11:05:51] <toddmparker_> re-schedule for next week, same time
[11:06:13] <Wilto> We don’t have to take this call. Look like we’re… [cue: sunglasses] …Off the hook. [cue: The Who]

[11:06:33] <toddmparker_> kinblas: i think we should store all this variance between devices and platforms
[11:06:45] <toddmparker_> but i think for now we should keep reporting simple
[11:07:07] <toddmparker_> we can mine this and say "wow, ios5 running on older devices is 78% slower"
[11:07:20] <toddmparker_> but the reporting is already pretty complex
[11:07:56] <toddmparker_> maybe we can eventually switch this up so we have a big chart with trend lines for each platform so you can see how it compares
[11:08:11] <toddmparker_> i'm open to whatever works

[11:28:39] <Wilto> As well you should, sir. As well you should.
[11:28:42] <toddmparker_> that's why you like this project
[11:28:48] <toddmparker_> UA free
[11:28:50] <kinblas> johnbender: lol
[11:29:13] <toddmparker_> you should contribute to wurfl
[11:29:36] <kinblas> toddmparker_: lol, I was just thinking that
[11:29:44] <kinblas> it must suck on the wurfl project
[11:29:54] <kinblas> dealing with all the different UA
[11:31:15] <toddmparker_> http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/pron.htm
[11:31:18] <kinblas> is it just me that likes the little pop'ing sound the WP.7 device makes when you type?
[11:31:45] <toddmparker_> it makes me giggle
[11:31:55] <kinblas> lol
[11:31:58] <Wilto> “vur-flay.”
[11:31:59] <toddmparker_> sounds like you're making pop noises with your mouth
[11:32:11] <kinblas> lol ... exactly
[11:32:19] <kinblas> it makes me not mind typing
[11:32:32] <kinblas> anyways the touch typing on that thing seems more accurate than the other devices I have
[11:32:37] <kinblas> even with my fat thumbs
[11:33:42] <johnbender> kinblas: I like that sound too
[11:33:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah well our stats tracking is not UA free

[11:35:18] <johnbender> I hate everything about android at this point
[11:37:03] <Wilto> +1
[11:46:19] <toddmparker_> yeah, spacing is just as important as hit area

[11:49:35] <toddmparker_> but latest seems out of sync
[11:50:58] <toddmparker_> it's up. /text/ is inheriting right
[11:50:59] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/pages-themes/theme-a.html
[11:59:45] <toddmparker_> ok guys
[11:59:49] <toddmparker_> quick msft call
[11:59:53] <toddmparker_> then we push the button
[12:00:02] <toddmparker_> everything is queued up on my end
[12:00:13] <toddmparker_> anyone see anything in testing?
[12:22:27] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #267: SUCCESS in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/267/
[12:22:28] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: account for minor version only android version strings
[12:22:28] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: account for lack of 'mobile' in android ua strings
[12:22:29] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: missing escape
[12:32:20] <johnbender> lunch!
[12:40:37] <kinblas> johnbender: what time are you getting in tomorrow?
[12:41:11] <toddmparker_> ok so kinblas and johnbender - have you seen any issues in testing?
[12:41:11] <toddmparker_> any loose ends?
[12:41:42] <kinblas> toddmparker_: not so far
[12:41:45] <toddmparker_> unless you give us the high sign
[12:41:56] <kinblas> toddmparker_: should we split up the platforms?
[12:41:59] <kinblas> I was using ipad
[12:42:04] <kinblas> but probably should use something else
[12:44:44] <kinblas> toddmparker_: fixed footer positioning on WP7.5 is a bit off ... there's a gap between the footer and the bottom of the window ... not sure if that's always been the case or new?
[13:05:18] <kinblas> johnbender: yay, the visualize is giving a downward trend
[13:11:11] <toddmparker_> mat and i tested all the major platforms today
[13:11:23] <toddmparker_> we found that ugly BB7 issue
[13:11:28] <toddmparker_> more on them than us
[13:11:40] <kinblas> toddmparker_: Wilto: if you guys go to the Pages and Dialogs page ... and click on the multi-page template, does it load the template and then transition to another page?
[13:11:51] <toddmparker_> and the custom selects are popping up in an odd place on webos and opera mini
[13:11:54] <kinblas> I'm seeing this behavior on ipad
[13:12:00] <toddmparker_> what platform?
[13:12:30] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ipad 4.3.5
[13:14:20] <toddmparker_> ok in 5 on ipad
[13:15:04] <toddmparker_> ok on our 4.3 ipad
[13:15:11] <toddmparker_> just click that multipage link?
[13:15:20] <toddmparker_> load ok, doens't nav anywhere else
[13:15:28] <kinblas> yeah, but I'm seeing it on the Page transitions link too
[13:15:57] <kinblas> I'm tapping relatively fast on the link (over the words)
[13:16:35] <toddmparker_> hmm
[13:16:47] <toddmparker_> on the singel page template, are you not seeing a bg on the header
[13:16:52] <toddmparker_> if i reload, it comes back
[13:17:36] <toddmparker_> this is being a bit flaky
[13:17:42] <toddmparker_> i got a nav back once
[13:18:15] <toddmparker_> can't repro any of these consistently
[13:19:17] <toddmparker_> pushstate bug?
[13:19:30] <toddmparker_> you need to go to multi > back > single etc.
[13:19:34] <toddmparker_> to make it happen
[13:20:21] <toddmparker_> yeah so i can repo
[13:20:26] <toddmparker_> refresh the list page
[13:20:33] <toddmparker_> click on either multi or single
[13:20:35] <toddmparker_> hit back
[13:20:44] <toddmparker_> click on the other page
[13:20:48] <toddmparker_> and it does it
[13:20:53] <toddmparker_> both are rel=external
[13:21:03] <toddmparker_> seems like the pushstate flakiness
[13:21:32] <toddmparker_> anyway, let's refine that and log it
[13:21:44] <kinblas> toddmparker_: hmmm ok, can you repro on the "Page transitions" link?
[13:21:50] <kinblas> I don't think that is external?
[13:21:55] <toddmparker_> it is
[13:22:00] <kinblas> really?
[13:22:03] <toddmparker_> the dialog is in that page
[13:22:03] <kinblas> why?
[13:22:04] <kinblas> :-)
[13:22:12] <kinblas> ok
[13:22:13] * kinblas punts
[13:22:17] <toddmparker_> so i wouldn't have to load the page over and over
[13:22:35] <toddmparker_> this is a real issue
[13:22:44] <toddmparker_> i've seen other reports
[13:23:00] <toddmparker_> does pushstate doe stuff when it's nto supported?
[13:23:14] <toddmparker_> odd that this affects 4.3 since it doesn't support the feature
[13:23:54] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah it's wierd ... if pushtate goes wrong it screws up the history/hash
[13:23:58] <kinblas> so things go haywire
[13:24:28] <toddmparker_> yea
[13:26:07] <toddmparker_> but any concerns with telling john to tag this release?
[13:26:19] <kinblas> toddmparker_: not so far
[13:26:29] <kinblas> this one got my attention though :-)
[13:28:26] <toddmparker_> ok
[13:28:39] <toddmparker_> i'l going to check in my last changes
[13:28:47] <toddmparker_> to update the code and banner to rc3
[13:28:50] <toddmparker_> and email john
[13:28:58] <toddmparker_> speak now.....
[13:30:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/2i48jw
[13:30:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Updated references from RC2 to RC3 for release - toddparker
[13:32:03] <toddmparker_> ok, checked in my changes, emailed mr. resig
[13:32:14] <toddmparker_> time to wait
[13:33:19] <kinblas> toddmparker_: on the selects page
[13:33:24] <kinblas> the horizontal group is wrapping
[13:33:26] <kinblas> on iPad
[13:33:34] <Wilto> I hit up the performance test page on damn near everything, too.
[13:33:35] <kinblas> in portrait mode
[13:33:36] <Wilto> The what now
[13:33:40] <toddmparker_> oh, the demo?
[13:33:56] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah
[13:34:42] <Wilto> ON IT.
[13:34:53] <toddmparker_> quickie
[13:34:59] <kinblas> it's the month/day/year one
[13:35:00] <toddmparker_> gonna get rid of the fieldcontain
[13:35:09] <toddmparker_> so the label stacks
[13:36:11] <kinblas> wow you guys added a lot of new docs
[13:36:14] <kinblas> :-)
[13:36:29] <toddmparker_> yep
[13:37:01] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so are you going to update the perf chart?
[13:37:17] <kinblas> or just going with what we got over the weekend?
[13:37:45] <kinblas> I'm a bit disappointed about how targeted the perf enhancements were
[13:38:15] <kinblas> wish we had more time
[13:38:45] <kinblas> by targeted I meant .. it was all pretty much listview stuff
[13:40:12] <toddmparker_> cna't for today
[13:40:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/OEmyLA
[13:40:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed controlgroup - toddparker
[13:40:28] <toddmparker_> it'll give me more to talk about on the 1.0 release
[13:40:34] <toddmparker_> i'll make new/different charts
[13:49:26] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/NOFwCg
[13:49:26] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Kludged a little padding into the theme nav. Tell no one of this. - Mat Marquis
[13:49:31] <Wilto> (Shh.)
[13:51:33] <kinblas> heh
[13:52:25] <toddmparker_> fixing one small link issue on those new theme pages
[13:53:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/UN7rOg
[13:53:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes footer nav links on new theme pages. - Mat Marquis
[13:56:48] <johnbender> kinblas: my flight gets in at like 11 so noon?
[13:56:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/gK_6Ow
[13:56:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixing ‘home’ link on new theme pages. - Mat Marquis
[13:56:52] <johnbender> or thereabouts
[13:57:01] <johnbender> kinblas: going to take the bart in
[13:57:07] <johnbender> err
[13:57:07] <Wilto> what i didn’t see any last-second push what are you talking about
[13:57:15] <johnbender> maybe I should take caltrain hmmm
[13:58:21] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm also confused about your comment https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2237
[13:58:21] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by raziel057 (3m, 1w ago): Don't apply $.mobile.activeBtnClass on a "disabled" button of navbar
[13:58:29] <johnbender> let me know when you get back
[13:59:29] <kinblas> johnbender: oh
[13:59:39] <kinblas> what I was saying is that the click handler is added during create
[13:59:52] <kinblas> if the patch says don't attach a click handler (based on current disabled status)
[13:59:58] <johnbender> kinblas: I thought delegate worked like live but on a targetted element
[14:00:32] <johnbender> so it will only trigger for non disabled elements later when a clikc bubbles up to the $navbar
[14:00:51] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah, I guess you're right
[14:00:58] <kinblas> I always get confused by that
[14:01:11] <johnbender> me too thats why I wanted to double check  :(
[14:01:16] <kinblas> the selector isn't run until the navbar gets the event
[14:01:26] <johnbender> aparently we're also supposed to migrate to .on in place of delegate
[14:01:41] <kinblas> ... and live/die
[14:01:48] <johnbender> yah
[14:03:17] <Wilto> Yes indeed.
[14:03:44] <Wilto> They’re mo’ quicker, too.
[14:04:02] <Wilto> —uh oh. Anyone know why the build script could be broken?
[14:04:26] <johnbender> Wilto: you mean `make` ?
[14:04:29] <kinblas> doh
[14:04:44] <Wilto> I have no idea what I mean. Just seeing Resig’s email.
[14:05:04] <johnbender> haven't gotten it yet
[14:05:12] <johnbender> eddie isn't around either
[14:05:18] <johnbender> I can try and take a look once I get it
[14:05:27] <Wilto> This is Less Than Ideal™.
[14:05:33] <kinblas> lol
[14:06:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you know what he's referring too specifically? I can try and take a look
[14:06:30] <Wilto> “None of the URLs are being replaced correctly anymore.”
[14:06:35] <johnbender> yah
[14:06:38] <johnbender> I don't know what that means
[14:06:40] <toddmparker_> there is a build script john uses to build all the zips and cdn files
[14:06:43] <Wilto> Ditto.
[14:06:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: is that part of our project or does it live on the server?
[14:09:35] <toddmparker_> i really don't know
[14:09:52] <toddmparker_> i assumed this was some magic on john's machine but it must be in git if someone messed with it
[14:11:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sigh
[14:11:13] <johnbender> let me look at the diff
[14:11:25] <toddmparker_> ok,thanks
[14:11:42] <toddmparker_> is it this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/Makefile
[14:12:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/7WVylQ
[14:12:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] account for droid x ua string - John Bender
[14:12:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to check out the diff log on that file
[14:15:07] <toddmparker_> dunno if that's it
[14:16:58] <Wilto> Hey johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/366d33ead07feb4a16fb802616baa6b762cf7bce#Makefile
[14:16:59] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (4d, 20h ago): Update Makefile to actually work on the server
[14:17:15] <Wilto> Lookin’ like some pretty major changes in that neighborhood.
[14:21:40] <danheberden> yeah, wasn't the whole thing re-written?
[14:22:23] <danheberden> it puts them in the cdn but never refreshes the cache :/
[14:22:34] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #268: SUCCESS in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/268/
[14:22:35] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Updated references from RC2 to RC3 for release
[14:22:35] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Removed controlgroup
[14:22:36] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Kludged a little padding into the theme nav. Tell no one of this.
[14:22:36] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Fixes footer nav links on new theme pages.
[14:22:37] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Fixing ‘home’ link on new theme pages.
[14:24:54] <toddmparker_> things seem ok
[14:25:15] <toddmparker_> so i published the blog post: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/11/13/jquery-mobile-rc3-released
[14:26:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ah so there's something that does a replacement of the links in the blog pages
[14:27:15] <toddmparker_> WAT?
[14:27:33] <johnbender> that doesn't
[14:27:34] <danheberden> ?tell eddiemonge might be good to loop through the JSFILES,CSSFILES and CSSTHEMEFILES in the jqm Makefile to force cache propagation on the cdn
[14:27:35] <bot-t1> danheberden, Okay.
[14:28:00] <danheberden> "there's something that doesn't a replacement".. ?
[14:32:13] <johnbender> danheberden: https://gist.github.com/ca79848be552254267cb
[14:32:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[14:32:21] <johnbender> thats the bit we're missing I thinkn
[14:32:55] <toddmparker_> i see
[14:32:58] <johnbender> the VER variable has been changed though
[14:33:03] <toddmparker_> so what does that affect? docs pages?
[14:33:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the blog too I believe
[14:33:34] <johnbender> I think that's what jresig was referring to
[14:33:56] <johnbender> could be wrong
[14:34:07] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ah nevermind he lined to the demos/docs
[14:34:10] <toddmparker_> i see
[14:34:11] <johnbender> *linked
[14:34:18] <toddmparker_> mind replying with that to john?
[14:35:01] <danheberden> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/366d33ead07feb4a16fb802616baa6b762cf7bce/Makefile#L112
[14:35:09] <danheberden> looks like it's trying to do the same thing?
[14:35:35] <kinblas> so the demos dir has its own copy of the built-src
[14:38:50] <toddmparker_> updated the blog post with the latest commits: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/11/13/jquery-mobile-rc3-released/
[14:39:16] <toddmparker_> so kinblas - does that email with results take into account that 700ms fix?
[14:39:27] <kinblas> yes!
[14:39:52] <kinblas> toddmparker_: note there's an extra set of numbers
[14:40:00] <kinblas> you want to look at the 2nd number in each grouping
[14:40:07] <kinblas> that's the enhancement improvement
[14:40:24] <kinblas> the last one is the time from changePage called to completely done
[14:40:34] <kinblas> done being transition complete
[14:43:14] <toddmparker_> kinblas: dang it, where is that link again?
[14:44:32] <kinblas> http://shinarp.com/jqm/profile/results/load-times-20111114.html
[14:45:13] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ^^^
[14:46:08] <toddmparker_> ok, so the 4th number "changepage"
[14:46:16] <kinblas> pagechange
[14:46:39] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah so it's the time from when we say "load page X" to page X is now on screen
[14:47:18] <kinblas> toddmparker_: note that it includes more than load + enhance + transition because there's some book keeping we do
[14:47:31] <toddmparker_> i see
[14:47:45] <toddmparker_> so the increases here might be more subtle, right?
[14:48:10] <kinblas> yeah that's what I was trying to say yesterday when trying to distinguish between "render" and "enhance"
[14:48:15] <toddmparker_> yeah
[14:48:16] <kinblas> the percieved time
[14:48:20] <kinblas> is probably the last number
[14:48:24] <toddmparker_> so could be as low as 10-20%
[14:48:35] <kinblas> yeah
[14:48:40] <kinblas> but that said
[14:48:47] <kinblas> the load and transition times swing wildly
[14:48:52] <toddmparker_> some big improvements
[14:48:54] <kinblas> depending on network, etc
[14:48:55] <toddmparker_> yeah
[14:49:40] <toddmparker_> cool
[14:49:52] <toddmparker_> but did you run this before that last commit?
[14:49:59] <toddmparker_> so it's actually faster?
[14:50:03] <kinblas> lol
[14:50:07] <kinblas> yes!
[14:50:10] <kinblas> the numbers don't lie
[14:50:22] <kinblas> remember those are just snapshots of a particular run
[14:50:42] <kinblas> they aren't actually the "best"
[14:50:51] <kinblas> so the question should be ... does it feel faster?
[14:51:10] <kinblas> the problem is that rendering is slow
[14:51:34] <kinblas> you can see that now, most of the time is in rendering
[14:51:38] <kinblas> rendering/transition
[14:52:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so I can see how to fix the Makefile but I'd rather not monkey with it right especially given that it does remotely alter the server
[14:53:29] <toddmparker_> yeah
[14:53:45] <toddmparker_> i'd rather hear from eddie first
[14:54:58] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/eoWUnA

[14:55:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3042 from MauriceG/patch-15 - Todd Parker
[14:57:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah this is partly my fault, I didn't take much time to review the makefile stuff save for the basic builds of the js and css
[15:01:08] <toddmparker_> i just didn't understand allt eh stuff it did
[15:01:13] <toddmparker_> anyway RC3 is out
[15:01:21] <toddmparker_> we're drinking a celebraroty beer
[15:01:34] <kinblas> congrats guys
[15:01:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah it's just moving the demo subsite to the cdn version
[15:01:43] <johnbender> indeed
[15:01:43] <toddmparker_> look, it b33r spelling ^^
[15:01:43] <kinblas> it's not a release unless something goes wrong
[15:01:46] <johnbender> congats
[15:01:48] <toddmparker_> great work all around chaps
[15:01:55] <gseguin> Congrats guys!
[15:02:13] <kinblas> ... I feel paranoid when things go too smooth :-)
[15:02:18] <toddmparker_> was just saying that we might want o fix up the positioning of custom selects on webos and opera mini
[15:02:31] <toddmparker_> but i sort fo want leave this as-is
[15:02:41] <kinblas> toddmparker_: is that new?
[15:02:44] <toddmparker_> not *too* smooth kinblas
[15:02:47] <toddmparker_> not sure
[15:02:58] <toddmparker_> feel like we had this working better a long time ago
[15:03:12] <toddmparker_> but it opens the menu way above you, out of view
[15:03:19] <kinblas> ok, then we should look into it
[15:03:22] <kinblas> ... for 1.0?
[15:03:33] <toddmparker_> guess on browsers that get scrollOverset wrong
[15:03:37] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:03:53] <toddmparker_> it can just open over where you clicked?
[15:04:12] <toddmparker_> tho i wonder if that's what it's trying to do
[15:04:15] <toddmparker_> anyhoo
[15:04:23] <Wilto> High-fives all around, guys.
[15:04:29] <toddmparker_> i'd like to sort of stop any churn on 1.0
[15:04:34] <toddmparker_> quiet period
[15:04:47] <toddmparker_> so when we push it, there's no drama and little testing required
[15:04:51] <toddmparker_> it can be a happy time
[15:04:53] <Wilto> VACATIONS FOR EVERYONE
[15:05:03] <kinblas> heh
[15:05:04] <toddmparker_> now for 1.1. no vacations
[15:05:10] <Wilto> aww
[15:05:29] <toddmparker_> looks like we can have sergey crank on more performance stuff
[15:05:44] <toddmparker_> i'd like to start gathering a wishlist for 1.1/2
[15:05:54] <toddmparker_> maybe start a wiki page
[15:06:04] <toddmparker_> my #1 is transition smoothness
[15:06:14] <toddmparker_> followed closely by scrolling smoothness
[15:06:35] <kinblas> toddmparker_: hey
[15:06:39] <toddmparker_> kinblas: you wanna do some prototyping?
[15:06:42] <toddmparker_> hey what
[15:06:44] <kinblas> one of the new  headers on the blog
[15:06:47] <kinblas> is Vistview
[15:07:04] * kinblas is cribbin' some verbage and noticed it
[15:07:41] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah we need to fix transitions and scrolling see if we can get them to play better and less jarring
[15:07:56] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:08:04] <toddmparker_> the touchoverflow also needs some love
[15:08:06] <kinblas> toddmparker_: who's your copy-editor? :-P
[15:09:09] <Wilto> I think you just called dibs, kinblas.
[15:09:15] <toddmparker_> fixed
[15:09:31] <toddmparker_> i don't have any copy editors, everyone forgot their logins
[15:09:37] <kinblas> lol
[15:09:45] <toddmparker_> vistviews, fixed
[15:09:49] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I sort of remember what you set it to
[15:09:55] <kinblas> but it was taking
[15:10:02] <toddmparker_> i think giving a fresh look to transitions and fixed headers is a good idea
[15:10:12] <toddmparker_> the ios5 scrolling feels kinda off
[15:10:48] <toddmparker_> my big Q is whether we should just come up with new transitions that look good on all platforms first (deal with the scrolling stuff elegantly)
[15:10:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: +1 new transition
[15:10:56] <johnbender> that
[15:11:00] <johnbender> new
[15:11:08] <kinblas> toddmparker_: we need to invite sven ... @frequent (I think that's his github handle) an invite for the meeting on thursday
[15:11:20] <toddmparker_> and look at whether it's better to do fixed toolbars with the voerflow containers or position fixed
[15:11:30] <toddmparker_> yeah, good idea
[15:12:15] <toddmparker_> anyway, i think if kinblas and I jammed on this for a bit, we could come up with some new transitions that look good.
[15:13:02] <kinblas> toddmparker_:  so HEAD is "locked"?
[15:13:18] <kinblas> no checkins unless approved?
[15:14:16] <johnbender> ooh
[15:14:18] <johnbender> I like that idea
[15:14:20] <johnbender> FROZEN
[15:14:30] <toddmparker_> basically, yes
[15:14:32] * johnbender sets up his autoturret
[15:14:39] <toddmparker_> i want to take this RC seriously
[15:14:43] <toddmparker_> heh
[15:14:46] <kinblas> yeah good idea
[15:14:51] <kinblas> so what was that you just landed?
[15:14:51] <johnbender> branches!
[15:14:52] <kinblas>  :-P
[15:14:57] <toddmparker_> besides, we can work on fun stuff sooner
[15:15:15] <johnbender> kinblas: docs :D
[15:15:15] <toddmparker_> danheberden: need you help
[15:15:31] <kinblas> oh ok, can we still document stuff?
[15:15:39] <toddmparker_> the blog post is cached and I need to refresh it
[15:15:45] <toddmparker_> yeah, for sure
[15:15:51] <Wilto> johnbender: (Was that a Starcraft reference?)
[15:15:54] <toddmparker_> just keep the code changes to a bare minimum
[15:16:03] <toddmparker_> i'd love to add more docs
[15:16:12] <toddmparker_> i added a bunch of stuff last night
[15:17:00] <johnbender> Wilto: no but I know what you mean
[15:17:52] <toddmparker_> NERDS
[15:20:38] <Wilto> That’s why you should blacklight test all new employees for hidden videogame tattoos, toddmparker_. You did this to yourself.

[15:21:08] <toddmparker_> true
[15:22:32] <Wilto> I have nightmares about commit messages like “account for droid x ua string.”
[15:22:51] <Wilto> You’re a brave man, johnbender.
[15:26:13] <johnbender> Wilto: yah I've started this cat and mouse game where I see 0.0 in the android version output charts and I have to go sort out what the new version string looksl ike
[15:26:21] <johnbender> on the droid its 2.1-update1
[15:26:23] <johnbender> :/
[15:26:42] <johnbender> had to do that twice today
[15:27:50] <Wilto> Ugh.
[15:28:13] <Wilto> How people use UAs to do production-y things baffles me.
[15:28:31] <johnbender> Wilto: there are some databases that do the mapping for you I think eh?
[15:28:41] <Wilto> oh god WURFL
[15:28:50] <johnbender> fools errand to do it yourself for the most part but what I'm doing isn't going to be public so its "OK"
[15:30:32] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2237
[15:30:33] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by raziel057 (3m, 1w ago): Don't apply $.mobile.activeBtnClass on a "disabled" button of navbar
[15:30:46] <johnbender> I had a thought
[15:30:51] <johnbender> but then I thought better :)
[15:31:27] <johnbender> kinblas: ah yes, so I think this would better in the loop
[15:31:32] <johnbender> as a "hasClass"
[15:31:47] <johnbender> going to try and repro in jsperf
[15:32:16] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, totally makes sense in this case.
[15:32:27] <kinblas> johnbender: you're going to find that hasClass is faster ... much faster
[15:32:36] <johnbender> yah I would imagine so
[15:32:43] <kinblas> the delegate thing goes through closest
[15:32:46] * johnbender is thinking perf everywhere now
[15:33:00] <kinblas> ha! greate!
[15:33:05] <kinblas> great even!
[15:37:31] <toddmparker_> perf perf perf
[15:38:13] <aaronmcadam> I'm wondering how much of an accumulated difference delegate would make
[15:39:50] <aaronmcadam> Addy: "Note: As of jQuery 1.7 all of these three methods (bind/live/delegate) use .on() and .off() when you call them, so calling these newer methods directly is advised."
[15:45:26] <Wilto> One less lookup, but, eh.
[15:45:31] <toddmparker_> johnbender: want to take the lead on dropping in 1.7 and seeing what breaks or needs to be upgraded?
[15:45:37] <toddmparker_> 1.7 support should be 1.1
[15:45:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sho thang
[15:45:58] <toddmparker_> thankkkks
[15:46:27] <toddmparker_> Q; Hey @toddmparker, does the collapsible-set fire an event that I can capture? I want to do something when a specific section is expanded.
[15:46:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: are you creating issues in the tracker for those tasks?
[15:46:31] <Wilto> I haven’t read anything about 1.7 that stands to break jQM completely—anyone else?
[15:46:33] <toddmparker_> suggestions?
[15:46:33] <aaronmcadam> yeah Wilto, but I guess the context still doesn't get set with the live syntax
[15:46:49] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it fires expand and collapse
[15:47:09] <aaronmcadam> Wilto: I'm using it fine
[15:47:33] <toddmparker_> thanks kinblas
[15:47:33] <aaronmcadam> Wilto: webkit has deprecated eventX/Y and will remove the feature completely which is why it's removed from 1.7
[15:47:43] <toddmparker_> figured, just making sure
[15:48:08] <Wilto> Yeah, I heard about that.
[15:48:18] <Wilto> Chrome was throwing all kinds of errors related thereto.
[15:48:24] <aaronmcadam> basically, looks like webkit will just error in the next versions
[15:48:35] <Wilto> Chromium*
[15:48:41] <aaronmcadam> chrome 16 just warns
[15:48:45] <Wilto> Ah.
[15:48:54] <aaronmcadam> cool, good to know it's already landed in trunk
[15:49:22] <aaronmcadam> I've been using 1.7 since release with no issues

[15:51:16] <kinblas> toddmparker_: johnbender: CAn I check in the page timing stuff I use as a bookmarklet in tools/ ?
[15:51:31] <johnbender> kinblas: yes please
[15:51:47] <kinblas> okie dokie
[15:51:50] <Wilto> Seconded.
[15:52:07] <toddmparker_> i need to highlight the tools stuff and testing stuff somewhere
[15:52:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: lets keep the test pages under wraps for now
[15:52:40] <toddmparker_> speed or unit?
[15:52:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'd like to password protect the speed stuff
[15:52:59] <johnbender> so we don't get randoms logging a ton of data into our db
[15:53:07] <johnbender> I think thats a good goal
[15:53:11] <johnbender> it's just not ready yet
[15:53:33] <toddmparker_> ok, np
[15:53:47] <Wilto> Yeah, give the word when that’s starting to look pretty well locked-down. Tweet that sucker out and get us some data.
[15:53:49] <toddmparker_> wish we had some graph numbers for earlier releases
[15:54:06] <kinblas> toddmparker_: lol, you edited my checkin comment :-P
[15:54:27] <toddmparker_> i did, sorry
[15:54:34] <toddmparker_> fun easter egg if they click thru
[15:54:40] <kinblas> oh, the bookmarklet just throws a dialog
[15:54:42] <kinblas> it's not the profiler
[15:54:45] <toddmparker_> i edit most so there's some english and stuff
[15:55:06] <kinblas> it gives you the 4 numbers I write down in that table of devices I send out
[15:55:29] <toddmparker_> gotcha. still useful
[15:55:44] <toddmparker_> but would require some explaination
[16:03:03] <Wilto> Headed out for the night, guys. Congrats all around!

[16:15:25] <johnbender> is there an explicit way to disable those buttons or any buttons
[16:15:43] <johnbender> I feel like this should be obvious but I'm not seeing it
[16:17:07] <johnbender> he must just be applying it manually
[16:18:50] <johnbender> in that case I'm wondering if we should provide a way to explicitly disable buttons
[16:18:58] <johnbender> tying to a class seems odd
