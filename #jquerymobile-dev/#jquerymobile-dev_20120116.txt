[08:15:32] <Wilto> Quiet in here.
[08:59:38] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:02:02] <Wilto> Yo yo yo.
[09:05:40] <gseguin> Not to pick on them but when you claim to have an innovative framework and you put a quote as a png: http://www.jqmobi.com/images/Quote_Zynga.png  you kinda lose credibility, in my eyes at least
[09:11:33] <Wilto> And using a perfectly @font-face-able typeface as an image, no less. And using said typeface—Chunk—for copy, which is just atrocious.
[09:11:37] <toddmparker_> ;)
[09:11:54] <Wilto> The internet is workin’ my last nerve this morning.
[09:12:28] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin - did the API stuff change over the weekend? Wilto's builder is busted and before I fire him, I want to make sure it's actually his fault - http://filamentgroup.com/jqm/builder/
[09:12:51] <toddmparker_> nevermind, I don't care if his firing is based on actual facts,
[09:13:01] <gseguin> I don't understand why people put so much energy into talking shit instead of spending half of it helping us out
[09:13:06] <Wilto> http://amd-builder.no.de/jquery-mobile/master/dependencies?baseUrl=js
[09:13:21] <Wilto> Looks like it’s down hey brb guys todd said he wants to talk to me about something
[09:13:36] <gseguin> :)
[09:13:41] <gseguin> I'll look at it
[09:13:47] <Wilto> Thanks, dude.
[09:13:53] <Wilto> Also, +1 to the above.
[09:13:57] <gseguin> the only thing I pushed is the generic metadata
[09:20:58] <gseguin> that's very weird
[09:21:04] <gseguin> it's pingable
[09:21:14] <gseguin> if I ssh to it the service is up and running
[09:21:26] <gseguin> but I can't curl from the outside
[09:26:51] <toddmparker_> odd. thanks for giving this a look gseguin
[09:27:05] <gseguin> I'm rebooting the VM
[09:27:46] <gseguin> btw toddmparker_, I've talked with danheberden about getting a machine with NodeJS on it to run that service
[09:28:00] <toddmparker_> oh, great
[09:28:06] <toddmparker_> seems do-able?
[09:28:12] <gseguin> it's not going to be for right now
[09:28:15] <gseguin> but near future
[09:28:20] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[09:28:27] <toddmparker_> like in the next few weeks?
[09:28:40] <gseguin> he didn't give me a timeframe
[09:29:20] <Wilto> Yeah, I guess he’s waiting on MT for something.
[09:29:42] <gseguin> MT ?
[09:30:02] <Wilto> Oh, “Media Temple.”
[09:30:26] <gseguin> oh ok
[09:30:46] <rwaldron> toddmparker_ when you have a moment, can you ping me? not urgent
[09:31:14] <toddmparker_> i'm here
[09:31:26] <toddmparker_> rwaldron ^
[09:31:31] <rwaldron> word
[09:31:48] <Wilto> He already fired me once today, if that’s what this is about.
[09:32:10] <rwaldron> Would you be opposed to letting me come over for a play date occassionally?
[09:33:27] <rwaldron> Basically, I was hoping Filament would be ok with me testing client apps built with jQuery Mobile
[09:33:36] <rwaldron> on your devices!
[09:33:57] <rwaldron> since I don't have access to such an array of lovely toys
[09:34:20] <rwaldron> and you benefit by seeing more real world development happening
[09:34:52] <rwaldron> I don't need an answer now
[09:35:00] <rwaldron> since I put you on the spot
[09:35:09] <rwaldron> feel free to take time and think about it
[09:35:12] <rwaldron> :)
[09:40:24] <johnbender> Everybody loves a little drama on Monday right?
[09:42:23] <gseguin> rwaldron: IRCCloud is having the hiccup, hence no response from Todd
[09:43:06] <gseguin> Wilto, you're here 4x more than usual!
[09:43:17] <Wilto> Is there a bunch of me?
[09:43:34] <gseguin> yeah! is it going to be 4x funnier ?
[09:44:38] * gseguin thinks funnier might not be proper english
[09:44:54] <rwaldron> gseguin oh
[09:45:53] <rwaldron> ?tell toddparker when you get back... this is what I said: http://pastie.org/3196276
[09:45:54] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
[10:14:32] <toddparker> hi all
[10:14:33] <bot-t> (28 mins 30 secs ago) <rwaldron> tell toddparker when you get back... this is what I said: http://pastie.org/3196276
[10:14:39] <toddparker> irc cloud is being flaky today
[10:15:06] <toddparker> rwaldron: sure, you're welcome to come by for testing. Just let me know when...
[10:15:27] <toddparker> i wasn't being moody, irc cloud was timing out :)
[10:15:48] <rwaldron> oh no problem
[10:15:55] <rwaldron> gseguin gave me the heads up
[10:15:59] <rwaldron> and thanks!
[10:16:03] <rwaldron> I'll be in touch :D
[10:50:16] <johnbender> kinblas: did you have any interest in addressing the two beforepagechange triggers?
[10:50:31] <johnbender> I know that's by design but I can't recall if that's something we wanted to fix
[10:50:38] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3347
[10:50:39] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3347 on jquery-mobile, reported by offsky (2w, 4d ago): pagebeforechange being called twice
[10:50:55] <johnbender> we need it there for the hooks
[10:51:08] <johnbender> so I guess when I say "fix", I mean sort something else out
[10:55:28] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm a bit slammed at the moment, but enforcing it so that it's called only once would involve having to move the actual page change code into a different function that could be called from the async loadpage callback, or from the sync changePage call (where they pass in the DOM element)
[10:56:14] <johnbender> kinblas: yep, don't want to do that just yet
[10:56:26] <johnbender> kinblas: I'll noodle a bit and see if I can come up with something
[10:56:31] <johnbender> doesn't seem likely though
[10:57:24] <kinblas> johnbender: so the interesting thing is this
[10:57:39] <kinblas> internally we call changePage() with an URL or a dom node
[10:57:56] <kinblas> if we switch to only one call
[10:58:13] <kinblas> we need to figure out if there are other notifications that need to be added to allow 3rd party devs
[10:58:18] <kinblas> to plugin like they do today
[10:58:27] <kinblas> some folks just want to handle the case when there is an URL
[10:58:40] <kinblas> others always want to handle the DOM case, because that's when things are said and done
[10:58:57] <kinblas> it's a little more complicated than just pearing it down to one notification
[11:00:56] <johnbender> kinblas: yah in the second case wouldn't it be pageload ?
[11:01:13] <johnbender> then you always have the DOM setup
[11:01:19] <kinblas> ??
[11:01:29] <kinblas> pageload only occurs if the page isn't already in the DOM
[11:01:47] <johnbender> hmm
[11:02:37] <johnbender> kinblas: I think this is a longer discussion (as I'm thinking about it), I'll wait until your free
[11:05:56] <gseguin_> Wilto: I still don't know what's wrong with the amd-buider.no.de service
[11:06:27] <gseguin_> if you know any expert in no.de SmartMachine maybe they can help me figure out what's going on
[11:17:42] <jrburke> gseguin_: what what kind of problem are you having with the service?
[11:17:58] <gseguin_> it pings
[11:18:00] <gseguin_> I can ssh
[11:18:11] <gseguin_> I can curl locally
[11:18:17] <gseguin_> but can't curl remotely
[11:18:38] <jrburke> hmm. ok. so yeah i won't be able to help with that one then. :)
[11:18:47] <gseguin> heh :(
[11:19:12] <gseguin> thanks though
[11:19:22] <jrburke> do they have a support channel? i have a no.de, but have not used it in a long while, the free beta thing. so don't know the support options
[11:19:58] <gseguin> yeah I took a quick look and found nothing obvious
[11:20:09] <gseguin> I'll spend some more time on it later
[11:24:57] <jrburke> gseguin: http://wiki.joyent.com/display/node/Node.js+SmartMachine+FAQ seems to indicate that some folks hang out on freenode's #node.js and #joyent
[11:25:45] * gseguin goes there to ask
[11:25:51] <gseguin> thanks jrburke
[11:26:34] <jrburke> sure, but yeah otherwise, looks like contact is hard to get, except through "community forum" which may be http://discuss.joyent.com/
[11:27:26] <johnbender> imjoshdean: hey
[11:29:01] <imjoshdean> johnbender: Yo.
[11:29:36] <johnbender> imjoshdean: so the only downside to switching to click from vclick is the delay
[11:29:41] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3351
[11:29:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3351 on jquery-mobile, reported by Mowd (2w, 4d ago): Close icon of dialog doesn't work with $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition set to "none"
[11:30:10] <johnbender> looking into it though
[11:30:59] <imjoshdean> johnbender: Sweet. Yeah I knew that would get brought up going into it, but I figured that the delay was a lesser evil.
[11:31:08] <johnbender> indeed it is
[11:31:09] <johnbender> sigh
[11:31:19] <johnbender> as I understand it that's a function of the heuristics
[11:32:06] <johnbender> imjoshdean: are you going to submit a pull for that, I want to make sure you get credit
[11:32:09] <johnbender> or is there already one
[11:37:32] <imjoshdean> 1 sec john
[11:42:07] <imjoshdean> johnbender: I have a PR for two bugs.

[11:42:40] <johnbender> thanks man

[12:08:54] <toddparker> Y YOU NO REPRO?
[12:11:45] <kinblas> toddparker: right, I could not repro, though Wilto said it was easy for him?
[12:13:21] <imjoshdean> toddparker: np
[12:36:56] <Wilto> Yeah, pretty consistent.
[12:38:31] <Wilto> I can’t help but think that it’s, like, an HTC thing. I mean, we were running the exact same release of 2.1.
[12:44:54] <toddparker> that is odd. not sure how to proceed there. android is so tough to support because if this funny business

[13:46:39] <rwaldron> no way.

[15:44:41] <johnbender> I think imjoshdean's does
[15:44:52] <johnbender> maybe that's what you mean when you said "builds upon" ?
[15:44:54] <gseguin> yes johnbender ?
[15:45:10] <johnbender> gseguin: wrong autocomplete
[15:45:11] <johnbender> :(
[15:45:20] <gseguin> oh ok
[15:45:25] <johnbender> garann: I think imjoshdean's does
[15:45:28] <imjoshdean> johnbender, garann: What do you guys want me to do with mine? I can nix it or keep it
[15:45:31] <garann> johnbender: no, what i meant by builds upon was that iirc imjoshdean's just stops the incorrect execution, so this redirects to the correct function
[15:45:36] <johnbender> imjoshdean: we need it
[15:45:47] * imjoshdean ctrl+z like a mother fucker
[15:45:55] <johnbender> lol
[15:46:06] <imjoshdean> We going to keep garann's too?
[15:46:38] <johnbender> garann: makes sense
[15:47:15] <johnbender> yah imjoshdean we'll need your logic for the continue too
[15:47:20] <johnbender> and I can do a refactor if one is necessary
[15:47:27] <imjoshdean> rock on
[15:47:42] <johnbender> but like I said, if you're feeling frisky tests are always appreciated
[15:47:47] <johnbender> prevents regressiosn
[15:47:49] <imjoshdean> I'm currently about to sledgehammer git, I don't like conflicts in svn, I don't like them in git

[15:48:51] <johnbender> getting the latest from origin?
[15:48:55] <imjoshdean> yeah,
[15:49:15] <imjoshdean> I was quite a bit behind, it seems.
[15:49:31] <imjoshdean> but I had conflicts between my buttonmarkup fix and garann's
[15:49:37] <johnbender> imjoshdean: that's what I figured
[15:49:40] <imjoshdean> so, naturally, I blame Wilto
[15:49:43] <johnbender> that should be minor though eh?
[15:49:54] <imjoshdean> It is.
[15:50:28] <johnbender> imjoshdean: we also try to rebase to avoid the extra commits caused by a merge conflict
[15:50:35] <johnbender> I won't dump that on you right now though
[15:50:46] <johnbender> something to keep in mind for the future though
[15:58:20] <imjoshdean> johnbender: well I screwed that up pretty good unforked, reforked. readding my changes, committing, pushing, submitting PR
[16:07:07] <johnbender> imjoshdean: kk, if you have questions on git don't hesitate to ask
[16:07:25] <imjoshdean> sounds good, mind if I just PM you?
