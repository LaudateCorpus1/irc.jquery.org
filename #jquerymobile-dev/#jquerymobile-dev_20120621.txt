[03:48:09] <_|Nix|_> WTF is going on? I'm getting a bunch of errors ...
[03:50:42] <_|Nix|_> I get "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jQuery16403355724054854363' of undefined" when I try to open the dialog from docs/pages/page-dialogs.html ...
[03:53:42] <agcolom> _Nix|_ Hi :-) is that on the test docs?
[03:53:53] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html
[03:53:55] <agcolom> ?
[03:54:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Weird ... the errors is gone now ...
[03:54:47] <agcolom> I am not getting it...
[03:54:58] <_|Nix|_> Totally weird ...
[03:55:21] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Try this: http://jsbin.com/otepum/126/#page2
[03:55:25] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Try this: http://jsbin.com/otepum/126/
[03:55:35] <_|Nix|_> Click on open dialog
[03:55:40] <_|Nix|_> I get an error.
[03:55:55] <_|Nix|_> Very strange.
[03:56:10] <agcolom> me too, parentPage[0] is undefined
[03:56:28] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK ... good.
[03:56:33] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So it's not just me.
[03:56:40] <agcolom> no :-)
[03:58:06] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! Seems such a simple use case ...
[03:59:13] <agcolom> I'll just try something...
[04:00:42] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I'm stumped ...
[04:01:28] <_|Nix|_> The funny thing is that I've had this happen to me in Chrome on a different page as well, but then that one seemed to "cure itself".
[04:05:39] <_|Nix|_> Very strange, but it works again on my local machine, so *shrug* ... phase-of-the-moon, or something.
[04:07:21] <agcolom> I get the same error in Safari and FF....
[04:08:23] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I guess it's the example, or something.
[04:08:44] <_|Nix|_> OK .... now I'm  pissed ... it broke ...
[04:09:18] <_|Nix|_> D000d! This is messed ... I add a select to a dialog and it breaks - badly.
[04:11:09] <agcolom> remove data-native="false" and it works
[04:11:24] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/otepum/139/
[04:11:41] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ ^
[04:12:35] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Of course, but the idea is to test custom select inside a dialog :)
[04:12:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... and it looks like listview is breaking ...
[04:13:01] <agcolom> ok...
[04:13:24] <agcolom> I tried on hte iPad, same thing happens
[04:13:36] <_|Nix|_> OK ... we got ourselves some breakage.
[04:28:53] <_|Nix|_> I know what it is. listview looks for the closest page via .closest( ".ui-page" ), but when it's inside a dialog, there is no .ui-page nearby ...
[04:29:22] <_|Nix|_> Wait a minute ... there is ...
[04:34:01] <agcolom> ah.... you've found something!!!!!
[04:35:15] <_|Nix|_> I think I have. The popup is getting attached to the body instead of the dialog.
[04:35:46] <agcolom> brilliant!
[04:35:52] <_|Nix|_> ... and then the listview inside the popup doesn't have a page parent, which it absolutely needs for some reason ...
[04:37:15] <agcolom> Excellent! At least you have a good understanding of what the problem is ;-)

[07:38:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: 2327 is already closed... saw your commit... nice fix!
[07:39:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4061
[07:39:21] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4061 on jquery-mobile (brunnsbe; 2m, 5d ago): Custom menu with a placeholder highlights first element in 1.1 Final and RC2 although it's not selected
[07:39:37] <uGoMobi> see http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/selects/custom.html first example
[07:40:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, that ... OK ... I get it. We need to turn off the active, but keep the highlight.
[07:40:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry about 2327 - I had an old tab open ...
[07:41:20] <uGoMobi> what do you mean by highlight? focus?
[07:41:49] <uGoMobi> yeah it's about the active state while you haven't selected anything yet... first item is just placeholder
[07:41:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
[07:42:30] <uGoMobi> and yes... first item just needs to get focus... like multi-select menus
[07:42:38] <MauriceG> Hi all!
[07:42:44] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[07:44:02] <MauriceG> Hi Jasper -  If somebody has a short moment: How to bind to a listview create event?
[07:44:32] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: sure... have a fiddle or something to look at?
[07:45:18] <MauriceG> If I bind to updatelayout all works fine. bind/live on create: nothing ...
[07:46:10] <uGoMobi> you use .trigger("create")?
[07:47:16] <uGoMobi> oh sorry... that's the event you want to bind to
[07:47:38] <MauriceG> like  $( '#listview').live ( 'create', function() { alert ( 'Yes, I'm there!' ); });
[07:48:20] <MauriceG> I've tried just for trying the same on a button.  seems they all are never created ...
[07:50:05] <uGoMobi> .live() doesn't work with jQuery 1.7.1
[07:50:36] <MauriceG> ok. I've used bind  and delegate ...
[07:51:14] <uGoMobi> I think create is an internal event
[07:51:29] <uGoMobi> if you do console log you probably never see it being fired
[07:53:58] <uGoMobi> but at the other hand, if you can trigger it, you would think it is possible to bind to it as well
[08:05:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IINM you bind to "create" not with .bind( "create" ), but by writing a widget and implementing the _create() method.
[08:06:18] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: "create" is not a public event, so I don't think you can bind to it
[08:06:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes that's the idea
[08:07:54] <uGoMobi> unless you trigger the "create" event yourself you can't bind to it
[08:08:56] <uGoMobi> because the listview widget doesn't fire the event but is only bound to it
[08:12:08] <MauriceG> ah so ...  sigh ...  So there os no way to catch a create event ?
[08:12:20] <MauriceG> os = is
[08:12:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: at second thought... not sure about what you said... I don't see the relation between the create event and the _create method
[08:13:23] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: no I don't think so
[08:15:01] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: the listview widget (like most widgets) is bound to "pagecreate" and "create",
[08:15:22] <uGoMobi> so I guess you could bind to pagecreate
[08:15:48] <uGoMobi> but I don't know your use case of course
[08:17:18] <MauriceG> Thanks a lot uGoMobi! I think, pagecreate will do it.
[08:17:36] <uGoMobi> you're welcome
[08:21:47] <MauriceG> But one thing: The docs say: "create:  triggered when a listview is created" ...  I've believed that  until now
[08:28:55] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: that sounds incorrect to me after I looked at the code
[08:31:12] <MauriceG> Same for button create event  ...  out now for a moment to take a stroll with the dog and the brother in law  :-)
[08:31:31] <uGoMobi> haha ok
[08:40:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You trigger "create" to enhance everything inside an element. This causes _create() to be called on widgets defined inside the element.
[08:43:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes you are correct, maybe I misunderstood you
[08:44:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the widget is bound to create, so when you trigger that the widget will enhance the elements

[09:53:45] <agcolom> Hey everyone :-)
[09:54:07] <toddparker> hi agcolom
[09:54:11] <toddparker> how goes?
[09:54:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne
[09:54:37] <agcolom> good! Crazy week with 19PRs just for the docs!!!!
[09:54:55] <toddparker> johnbender: I think you were going to look at perf testing the list view slowness. I know you've been busy so is this still open?

[09:55:04] <toddparker> wonder is gseguin would have time to give this one a look.
[09:55:04] <agcolom> and 18 commits of my own! It's always great to go throught the docs in detail!!!!
[09:55:12] <toddparker> wowie
[09:55:33] * gseguin looks
[09:57:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: toddparker : we have to update the supported platforms list (mostly newer versions of desktop browsers)
[09:57:57] <agcolom> ok
[09:58:04] <uGoMobi> which brings me to Opera 12
[09:58:12] <uGoMobi> did you see that issue toddparker ?
[09:58:17] <toddparker> nope
[09:58:42] <uGoMobi> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4521
[09:58:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4521 on jquery-mobile (chrisben; 6d, 7h ago): navigation broken in Opera12
[09:58:49] <toddparker> uGoMobi: if you want to update the browser list in the docs on master, I usually copy that over to the site and blog post
[09:59:07] <gseguin> toddparker: so what's up with 4340 ?
[10:00:22] <toddparker> uGoMobi: looks like that issue may go away with the prefixes?
[10:01:13] <toddparker> gseguin: on that issue, there is a PR to remove the logic to blur
[10:01:14] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes, transitions on Opera as well :-)
[10:01:40] <toddparker> I think we just wanted to benchmark 1.0.1 vs. 1.1.0 vs. this fix
[10:01:46] <toddparker> and land it
[10:01:57] <gseguin> ok
[10:02:23] <toddparker> johnbender: did you look at this at all? Maybe you can get gseguin  up to speed
[10:02:39] <johnbender> toddparker: wich
[10:02:42] <johnbender> the opera issue?
[10:02:58] <toddparker> no, the list view perf
[10:03:05] <toddparker> Commenting out the line:
[10:03:05] <toddparker> $( "." + $.mobile.activePageClass + " .ui-btn" ).not( link ).blur();
[10:03:14] <toddparker> is supposed to fix it up
[10:03:18] <johnbender> haven't yet
[10:03:25] <johnbender> but you're welcome to assign it to me :D
[10:03:34] <toddparker> gseguin can help out
[10:03:42] <johnbender> I thought uGoMobi was going to try out jsperf with that
[10:03:46] <johnbender> but it shouldn't be too hard
[10:03:54] <johnbender> I could have my issues mixed up too
[10:04:02] <johnbender> and it's not as though uGoMobi has been idle :D
[10:04:07] <toddparker> i'd rather land this if tests pass since it has been tested a fair amount and it *seems* that this code is vestigial.
[10:04:20] <gseguin> johnbender: that one is the listview performance thing
[10:04:20] <toddparker> we can always benchmark after to see if we 100% fixed this
[10:04:33] <uGoMobi> johnbender: what is this about?
[10:04:45] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4340
[10:04:46] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4340 on jquery-mobile (mruffolo; 1m, 1w ago): slow response when clicking item in large listview on mobile devices
[10:04:48] <johnbender> toddparker: well if the test suite is still there for testing if that's what you mean :D
[10:04:57] <toddparker> i sort of would prefer to live with this as long as we can to see if there is an edge case
[10:05:01] <toddparker> heh
[10:05:03] <toddparker> yeah
[10:06:17] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I was going to try jsperf with that whitespace remove function I added
[10:08:00] <johnbender> ah cool
[10:08:11] <johnbender> toddparker: if it feels snappier we can just go for it
[10:08:32] <johnbender> the perf testing thing will come later
[10:10:06] <gseguin> johnbender: where is that huge list test ?
[10:10:16] <johnbender> gseguin: it's in the jquerymobile.com site

[10:13:13] <uGoMobi> hi!
[10:14:00] <uGoMobi> is two the same comments in the same value an issue for the TR?
[10:14:09] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: ^
[10:15:14] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: sorry i don't understand
[10:15:15] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: I want to change the focus style so it has both inset as outset box-shadow
[10:15:35] <uGoMobi> one sec... I will copy a line here
[10:15:38] <tbenzige> ok
[10:16:15] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: -moz-box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 3px #387bbe /*{global-active-background-color}*/, 0px 0px 9px #387bbe /*{global-active-background-color}*/;
[10:16:46] <tbenzige> uGoMobi. That will work just fine
[10:16:51] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: just double checking if it can cause a problem when I use the same comment twice in the same value
[10:17:08] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: ok great, thanks!
[10:17:09] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: no not at all. that's already done with other comments quite a lot
[10:17:51] <uGoMobi> huh? withinin the same property/value set?
[10:18:01] <uGoMobi> within*
[10:18:23] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: well, no i guess not, but it doesn't matter to the parser where they are in the file
[10:19:02] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: ok, I just wanted to check if that would matter because I don't know how that parser works

[10:30:46] <uGoMobi> toddparker: tbenzige: is there a reason for all that those whitespaces inside the values in theme.css? readability or parser maybe?
[10:39:03] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: yeah the parser needs whitespace around the values

[13:09:42] <uGoMobi> people come and go
[13:09:51] <uGoMobi> one big party
[13:12:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 2 new commits to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/vy6dYw
[13:12:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Add a class while the TO page is being set up for show (block display, focus, scrolling, setting height) called ui-page-pre-in. This class sets the opacity of the TO page to 0 during this momentary process, which at least in my testing,  prevents fixed toolbars and pages from flickering during transitions when fixed toolbars are used in a web app mode in iOS (not Safari, but native webview). Fade transition 
[13:12:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Merge pull request #4462 from Diveboard/master - Jasper de Groot
[13:21:10] <agcolom> Hi, sorry I'm back!
[13:21:33] <agcolom> having kids homework panic!
[13:22:44] <agcolom> and my computer did something completely crazy (it went totally dead when I plugged it) Then managed to restart it and the date was 1st jan 2001
[13:28:44] <agcolom> Can't find the hangout... is it finished??
[13:29:15] <gseguin> agcolom: yeah it's done
[13:29:25] <toddparker> no problem agcolom
[13:29:32] <toddparker> so some key decisions for popup
[13:29:45] <toddparker> - keep it simple for 1.2, we can always add features later
[13:30:02] <toddparker> - we're going to move the current popup code to a branch for reference
[13:30:12] <johnbend1r> _|Nix|_: ^
[13:30:16] <agcolom> I think I had a "survoltage" (don't know English word for it)
[13:30:16] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK, so one popup for 1.s1.2
[13:30:28] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... for 1.2
[13:30:34] <toddparker> - in master, _|Nix|_ will go with the simpler, mutual exclusive approach since this will make the core plugin a lot smaller
[13:30:40] <toddparker> ^^
[13:30:43] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Power spike
[13:31:00] <toddparker> we may add the stack feature at a later point once we hear how people are using this
[13:31:07] <toddparker> or, we could offer it as a notional extension
[13:31:17] <toddparker> additional, not notional
[13:31:23] <toddparker> like custom select menus
[13:31:42] <toddparker> - we're not going to worry about up porting popup outside the page for now
[13:32:06] <toddparker> - we will add a close popup event that devs could use to open new popup or do whatever to provide a good hook
[13:32:17] <toddparker> think that should good
[13:32:32] <toddparker> you can never take away features so it's better to start with less
[13:32:40] <toddparker> see: nested listviews
[13:32:41] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK, just to get it straight: In master, when you open a popup, for as long as that popup is open, no other popup may open, and there's no way to dismiss the open popup other than "Back" or clicking outside the popup. Correct?
[13:32:43] <toddparker> :p
[13:33:18] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, none of the one-popup-causes-another-popup-to-disappear business, right?
[13:33:43] <toddparker> right, since that seems to add a lot of complexity. it's a constraint, but for the first version I think that
[13:33:50] <toddparker> that's ok
[13:33:55] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK. Understood.
[13:34:12] <toddparker> the stack you wrote is good stuff so we want to keep it for people that might need it
[13:34:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Understand though that the stuff currently in master does not allow for multiple popups to be open on the screen at the same time.
[13:35:50] <toddparker> right
[13:36:13] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The ability to have multiple popups on the screen at the same time is currently in a local and very outdated branch.
[13:36:22] <toddparker> the one thing we need to dice is what to do in master if someone tries to do what I did with the menu or tooltip example
[13:36:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Nothing. The link does not work. It is ignored. You can click on it all you want.
[13:36:53] <toddparker> yeah, multiple visible at once isn't needed, at least not for the foreseeable future
[13:37:40] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We already have a restriction that selects cannot be non-native inside popups. This is another such restriction.
[13:37:48] <toddparker> right
[13:38:02] <toddparker> we'll just have to document that clearly and remove al examples of it
[13:38:02] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Just gonna have to document it.
[13:38:05] <toddparker> ya
[13:38:26] <_|Nix|_> Alright - sounds like a plan.
[13:38:29] <toddparker> cool
[13:38:46] <toddparker> but keep wha thou have now in a branch so it's easy for people to grab the code
[13:39:05] <toddparker> i'd like to add this as an extension once we get the time, provided there is a demand
[13:39:23] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: It's not that simple. I'd rather make the current behaviour reachable via a plugin.
[13:39:30] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: That'll force clean design.
[13:41:57] <_|Nix|_> As for my schedule, I'll keep plugging away at popup for another ~two hours, and then I'm officially on vacation until a week from monday, but I'll probably poke around now and again ...
[13:43:02] <toddparker> ok
[13:43:18] <toddparker> we may need to finish this up for next week
[13:43:33] <toddparker> so whatever you can do to rough this out and give us some to-do's is appreciated
[13:44:25] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: What time next week?
[13:44:53] <gseguin> toddparker: there is one side effect to removing that .blur()
[13:45:05] <gseguin> I'm uploading a video on vimeo to show you
[14:07:57] <toddparker> ok gseguin
[14:08:14] <toddparker> I'd like to have an alpha of the 1.2 popup for the conference
[14:21:43] <toddparker> gseguin: is that video up?
[14:23:48] <toddparker> actually, gseguin I have that line commented out locally
[14:23:53] <toddparker> what should i look for?

[14:24:49] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4565 on jquery-mobile (AlexHowansky; 2d, 3h ago): Popups can not be defined outside the page they're used in.
[14:25:31] <uGoMobi> since _|Nix|_ is busy enough ... shall I comment there that we look into adding that in the future
[14:25:45] <toddparker> yes please
[14:25:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[14:25:52] <toddparker> tag as a feature request and close
[14:25:57] <uGoMobi> will add feature request label and leave the issue open
[14:26:02] <uGoMobi> oh.. and close :)
[14:26:05] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:26:30] <toddparker> it'll be easy to just look for that tag in the future
[14:26:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I might've just fixed 4061 ...
[14:26:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Unit tests pass and it looks good.
[14:26:59] <toddparker> gseguin: with that change, the list view is indeed faster
[14:27:06] <toddparker> but still not as fast as 1.0
[14:27:08] <toddparker> you seeing that?
[14:27:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I thought you already had fixed that one yesterday
[14:27:34] <toddparker> the active goes on quickly and I see the loader but it does seem to take a while to load the next page
[14:27:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, you said I couldn't close it.
[14:27:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ooops sorry... was looking at wrong issue
[14:27:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and you were right.
[14:28:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But now I think it's OK.
[14:28:18] <agcolom> just remembered there are a couple of docs issues I'd like to get your views about
[14:28:20] <uGoMobi> haha ok great _|Nix|_  :)
[14:28:27] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4488
[14:28:28] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4488 on jquery-mobile (pawl; 2w, 2d ago): submit requires delegate 'pageshow'
[14:29:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, there's an inconsistency: When you first open the menu and nothing is selected, the first item gets focused. However, when you hit the down arrow, the second item gets focused ////and/// receives the button-down class.
[14:29:22] <uGoMobi> down class? not hover?
[14:29:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think the very first item to get focused should receive the button-down class as well.
[14:29:26] <uGoMobi> strange
[14:29:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hover, down, whatever - it's darker than the other ones.
[14:29:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  yes i agree
[14:29:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's good, it looks good, but the first one should get it too.
[14:29:59] <uGoMobi> you have to know what you select when you hit enter
[14:30:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly.
[14:30:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and you don't, unless you hit down and then up, or something.
[14:30:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you have to look into popup before your vacation I can look into that select menu
[14:30:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you have it in a local branch?
[14:31:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll push the fix, and you can take a look at adding button-down/hover/whatever. Cool?
[14:31:33] <toddparker> gseguin: I'm seeing that list view crash my browser on the iPhone 4S
[14:31:39] <toddparker> if I scroll down and click
[14:31:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes sure
[14:32:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pushed.

[14:32:52] <agcolom> Ah also just remembered something important (possibly)
[14:33:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool... I'll check the down/hover state and make sure the first one gets it too
[14:34:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah - there should never be a situation where an item is focused, but not (down|hover)-ed.
[14:35:43] <agcolom> Chritian from Mozilla wants to see me next month. They want to have  3 mobile libraries support FF for Android by the end of the year.
[14:36:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: Can I move fitSegmentInsideSegment all the way out to the immediate function enclosing the definition of popup?
[14:36:37] <agcolom> He's organizing a jQuery test event in the London office with his FF mobile team
[14:36:59] <agcolom> so i might need to know what would be good to test...
[14:37:22] <agcolom> toddparker, johnbender ^^^^
[14:37:25] <johnbend1r> _|Nix|_: sure, though I still think its fine as a method
[14:37:57] <johnbend1r> agcolom: we probably when we do a 1.2 beta?
[14:38:39] <agcolom> yes, ok.
[14:40:35] <gseguin> toddparker: https://vimeo.com/44480742
[14:40:37] <agcolom> Their office is only 20mins walk from mine, so easy for me to go there and do some testing on their devices... so I think there will be an event in July. I'd like to test jqm on boot2gecko a bit more (at least the docs)... so if you think of something useful to test, then let me know...
[14:40:48] <gseguin> sorry for the orientation
[14:41:14] <agcolom> then I can go again between Sept and Dec...
[14:43:27] <agcolom> btw is jseguin French as well?
[14:46:37] <agcolom> who's the best person to do this one? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4461

[14:48:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: How about _applyTheme instead of _theme
[14:49:00] <_|Nix|_> ?
[14:49:14] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I like
[14:49:23] <_|Nix|_> Alright.
[14:50:12] <jseguin> agcolom: I've got some French in family, well Canadian French, but I'm strictly an anglophone unfortunately
[14:51:20] <johnbend1r> _|Nix|_: yah that's great
[14:53:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r, gseguin: _runOpenAnimation, _runCloseAnimation instead of _realOpen and _realClose?
[14:54:20] <gseguin> why not just _open and _close ?
[14:54:34] <agcolom> jseguin: Great! so a bit like me, Spanish surname and cannot speak a word!
[14:54:41] <gseguin> the prefixing _ indicates that it's private, right?
[14:54:43] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: johnbend1r said that'd be confusing when there's also a open close
[14:55:10] <gseguin> open and close are the public methods
[14:55:28] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I guess theres trigger and _trigger, so why not close and _close ...
[14:55:32] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[14:55:52] <_|Nix|_> Sold!
[14:56:05] <gseguin> now I don't understand exactly all that _real* functions are doing
[14:56:18] <gseguin> so there may be a better name
[14:56:36] <gseguin> but if it's just the underlying code for open and close
[14:56:40] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: _real means really open/close the popup
[14:56:43] <gseguin> then _open and _close is cool
[14:57:02] <gseguin> yeah so _open and _close
[14:57:49] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: There's the navigation dance you gotta do before opening and before closing, so that's open and close. _realOpen and _realClose refer to the actual animations.
[14:58:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, I'll change those to _open and _close.
[14:58:29] <gseguin> alright
[15:08:56] <johnbend1r> cool
[15:08:58] <johnbend1r> sounds good to me
[15:09:47] <agcolom> quick question... on iOS3, ui-btn-icon-no-text appear in a square (not in a circle) and the loader is also square. I know it's an ancient os, just wanted to check you knew...
[15:10:32] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ your demo from this afternoon: http://jsbin.com/otepum/126/ works great on iOS 3!
[15:11:14] <agcolom> (just the x icon to close the dialog is square but I suppose that's ok??
[15:11:59] <agcolom> ok, goodnight everyone...
[15:12:27] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Awesome! Nighterz!
[15:13:07] <gseguin> agcolom: probably no support for border-radius
[15:13:16] <agcolom> yeah probably
[15:14:00] <agcolom> but I was happy to see the dialog launching a popup with non-native select working fine!

[15:18:04] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I dunno ... osmosis, I guess ... just stuck to me.
[15:18:12] <toddparker> re: iOS3 - that is a rounding issue with Safari, not really fixable
[15:18:21] <agcolom> toddparker: Yes, I think so too!
[15:18:33] <toddparker> if the border-radius is more than 50% of the dimension, it freaks and goes square
[15:18:44] <toddparker> since radius is them able, hey
[15:18:58] <agcolom> it looks quite sweet square ;-)
[15:19:14] <gseguin> toddparker: did you see that video?

[15:19:57] <gseguin> yeah
[15:20:07] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: https://vimeo.com/44480742
[15:20:10] <toddparker> so it happens if you invoke the hold tap menu?
[15:20:23] <gseguin> well yes and no
[15:20:37] <gseguin> it's the hover state
[15:20:38] <toddparker> having a hard time reproducing
[15:20:45] <gseguin> so it comes right before the active state
[15:21:10] <gseguin> the .blur() clears that out it seems
[15:21:14] <toddparker> re-watching
[15:21:25] <gseguin> but it also makes things darn slow
[15:21:35] <toddparker> yeah?
[15:21:47] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: D000d! You got popup working with an arrow! Nice!

[15:23:15] <_|Nix|_> removeActiveLinkClass may need to do more than just remove active link class - maybe it needs to remove that class that makes it slightly darker, too.
[15:23:25] <toddparker> yeah, down state
[15:23:47] <gseguin> toddparker: I haven't pushed
[15:23:50] <toddparker> so that's a drawback
[15:24:00] <gseguin> yeah that's the one I commented out
[15:24:11] <toddparker> hmm
[15:24:23] <gseguin> now I wonder if we could select all the hovered state and blur them
[15:24:27] <toddparker> i'm still seeing a lot of crashing on my 4S with the list view perf page
[15:24:37] <toddparker> you see that too? esp. if you scroll down.
[15:24:37] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ have an issue with the dialog popup in the docs, but it gets solved once you're oprened the photo popup
[15:24:40] <toddparker> even with this fix
[15:24:56] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Is the dialog popup failing to show up?
[15:24:59] <gseguin> let me get my ipod touch
[15:25:23] <agcolom> no it looks like there are 2
[15:25:48] <toddparker> gseguin: with that line in, it takes 25 seconds to click a link near the bottom of that page
[15:26:00] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/htbTfA
[15:26:00] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] [custom select] Filter placeholders out of the list of selected items - Fixes: #4061 - Gabriel Schulhof
[15:26:15] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Wha ... ? Two dialogs?
[15:26:24] <gseguin> toddparker: yep I know
[15:26:31] <agcolom> it comes up, then blinks then when you dismiss it it goes smaller (and there's the same one still big behind, the small one slides right off screen and the big one disappears...
[15:26:39] <agcolom> I've got a picture...
[15:27:14] <toddparker> gseguin: with that line commented out, the list view crashes my iOS device every time
[15:27:24] <toddparker> so it either takes 25 seconds or crashes
[15:27:27] <toddparker> what the hell
[15:27:42] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Wow! That's insane!
[15:27:55] <agcolom> http://users.cscs.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jqm/popup.png
[15:28:14] <agcolom> iOS 4.3.3
[15:30:08] <toddparker> something is seriously wrong
[15:30:24] <gseguin> I would look into css first
[15:30:28] <toddparker> trying 1.6.4. on that page
[15:30:43] <agcolom> and on iOS 5.1 Maurice was getting something weird also, but different
[15:30:51] <gseguin> like rip out most of the styling and try again
[15:31:02] <toddparker> still slow
[15:31:10] <gseguin> btw my ipod touch's battery was dead
[15:31:23] <gseguin> I need a few minutes to get it started
[15:32:06] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: My guess: buggy transition.
[15:32:49] <agcolom> that's my feeling too
[15:33:11] <agcolom> and opening the photo with the flip transition fixes it!
[15:33:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: As long as the popup goes from not being visible to being on the screen by itself, and then back to not being visible, popup works. What happens in between is up to the transition.
[15:34:13] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I think it only seems related to #4417, because that one was also fixed by opening the photo popup. However, in that case there was a genuine problem.
[15:34:50] <agcolom> and you mentioned something along those lines in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4417#issuecomment-6439640 (opening popup with flip transition fixes problems!)
[15:34:50] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4417 on jquery-mobile (gabrielschulhof; 4w, 2d ago): Popup: Some transitions do not work on Safari 5.1.7 (7534.57.2) on Windows
[15:34:57] <toddparker> agcolom: for those popup examples, we need tone down the transitions
[15:35:04] <toddparker> looked cool on chrome but they drag
[15:35:06] <toddparker> my bad
[15:35:16] <toddparker> we're also getting rid of the chained popups
[15:36:21] <_|Nix|_> OK, I'm'a hit the hay. So, only the two major issues remaining: Disable popup chaining, and handle link clicking inside popup.
[15:36:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yar!
[15:36:30] <johnbender> :D
[15:36:34] <toddparker> gseguin: any ideas
[15:36:41] <_|Nix|_> L8R all!
[15:36:51] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks again for being so accomodating guy
[15:37:11] <toddparker> thanks _|Nix|_
[15:37:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It's all for the greater good.
[15:37:13] <agcolom> ok. I'm off too...
[15:37:20] * johnbender hopes so
[15:37:32] <gseguin> toddparker: none so far
[15:38:19] <agcolom> toddparker: would it be a good idea to have a word in the docs warning about popup transitions on mobile devices? maybe have a list of recommended ones?
[15:38:28] <agcolom> later _|Nix|_
[15:38:41] <toddparker> probably
[15:38:45] <toddparker> keep it simple
[15:39:12] <agcolom> toddparker we have a list of recommended ones for dialogs, so we could do the same...
[15:40:12] <agcolom> (although the reason there is to make ot more "dialog like": To make it feel more dialog-like, we recommend specifying a transition of "pop", "slideup" or "flip".)
[15:41:02] <agcolom> The rest is for tomorrow for me... Goodnight again...
[15:42:28] <toddparker> ok
[15:42:46] <toddparker> i think using fade by default and recommending none for speed is good
[15:42:52] <toddparker> the side up/down is way slow
[15:42:56] <toddparker> that kinda thing
[16:03:02] <johnbender> jzaefferer: working on my slides, incporating your feedback (good stuff)
[16:03:09] <johnbender> *incorporating
[16:15:41] <toddparker> gseguin: scott found the issue!!!
[16:15:59] * johnbender has no context and is still excited
[16:16:01] <toddparker> johnbender: you might be interested to hear this too
[16:16:05] <johnbender> :D
[16:16:11] <johnbender> which issue is this?
[16:16:17] <toddparker> the super slow clicking problem on long pages
[16:16:21] <johnbender> orly
[16:16:26] <toddparker> it's the transitions
[16:16:42] <johnbender> it's always the transitions :(
[16:16:43] <toddparker> in 1.0, we jumped to top, then started a transition
[16:16:53] <toddparker> in 1.1, we try to fade out (or whatever)
[16:17:02] <toddparker> first
[16:17:39] <johnbender> getting mobile phones to do compositing fast is just hard
[16:17:47] <johnbender> or at least it appears that way
[16:18:19] <toddparker> so if you're scrolled down on a long page and hit a transition, it can crash the browser
[16:20:03] <johnbender> so scrolling to the top reduced the load on the transition because anything below the fold is just sort of ignored?
[16:20:16] <toddparker> yeah, sort of
[16:20:19] <johnbender> I guess that makes sense
[16:20:30] <johnbender> given that when you scroll long pages it's often rendering on the fly
[16:20:34] <toddparker> seems that the browser keeps everything above your scroll position in memory
[16:20:43] <johnbender> ugh
[16:20:47] <johnbender> that's not good
[16:20:48] <toddparker> so that's why things got slow and crazy as you scrolled down
[16:21:39] <toddparker> scott added this test
[16:21:41] <toddparker> none = !$.support.cssTransitions || maxTransitionOverride || !name || name === "none" || Math.max( $( window ).scrollTop(), toScroll ) > screenHeight * 3,
[16:22:18] <toddparker> that last bit: if the scroll to is 3x the height of the device, skip the transition
[16:22:37] <toddparker> because you need to consider the page your on and the one you're going to
[16:22:47] <toddparker> esp. if you hit the back button
[16:23:57] <uGoMobi> nice catch scottjehl !!
[16:26:39] <johnbender> toddparker: so we're skipping transitions based on page size?
[16:28:09] <toddparker> ya
[16:28:17] <toddparker> well, scroll position actually
[16:28:33] <toddparker> if I'm navigating TO the list perf page, I'll se a transition
[16:28:42] <toddparker> but if I scroll down far enough, we skip it
[16:29:02] <johnbender> we might need yet another config
[16:29:04] <johnbender> :(
[16:29:35] <johnbender> let people force the transitions
[16:29:41] <johnbender> or determine the threshold
[16:32:43] <toddparker> yep
[16:32:49] <toddparker> just commented on the issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4340#issuecomment-6494740
[16:32:50] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4340 on jquery-mobile (mruffolo; 1m, 1w ago): slow response when clicking item in large listview on mobile devices
[16:32:55] <toddparker> suggested that very thing
[16:33:23] <toddparker> but is it ok to add a config param for 1.1.1?
[16:33:33] <toddparker> semver and all :)
[16:35:49] <johnbender> toddparker: well I wouldn't add that fix either way since it breaks the previous behavior but it's up to you
[16:36:00] <johnbender> if you change the behavior you might as well add the config
[16:36:13] <johnbender> at the least I would add the config and default it to the current behavior
[16:36:22] <johnbender> at 1.2 you can switch the default if you want
[16:41:00] <uGoMobi> good night all
[16:41:06] <toddparker> goodnight
[16:41:35] <toddparker> john bender - that's why i kicked this back to you and gseguin
[16:41:43] <toddparker> johnbender ^
[16:42:00] <toddparker> we need to do something for 1.1.1 because this is the #1 issue
[16:42:04] <toddparker> it's too slow/crashy
[16:42:34] <johnbender> toddparker: yah then I would say put it in but default it to off
[16:42:52] <johnbender> there are a lot of unknowns associated with that fix
[16:43:01] <toddparker> or set it on but at a decent threshold
[16:43:02] <johnbender> odd screen height reporting etc
[16:43:06] <johnbender> well
[16:43:16] <johnbender> who knows what that threshold should be
[16:43:18] <toddparker> it currently _crashes_
[16:43:26] <johnbender> but only for huge pages right?
[16:43:28] <toddparker> kinda bad
[16:43:44] <toddparker> well, longer pages
[16:43:58] <toddparker> sort of depends on the complexity of the page, memory of the devicee, etc.
[16:43:58] <johnbender> I'm concerned that we won't be able to test it fully and there's a corner case in there that will break someones existing code
[16:44:03] <johnbender> which it shouldn't do for a point release
[16:44:15] <toddparker> but the 2 best devices I have - iPad 3 + iPhone 4S both crash
[16:44:21] <johnbender> hmm
[16:44:26] <toddparker> pretty bad
[16:44:31] <toddparker> i need to test android
[16:44:35] <johnbender> yah then I guess it just has to be a highish threshold
[16:44:39] <toddparker> fire didn't crash but was slower
[16:44:46] <toddparker> this may be more of an iOS thing
[16:45:21] <toddparker> yeah, let's hash this out tomorrow
[16:45:21] <toddparker> i do think we need to do something
[16:45:23] <toddparker> this is a hot topic in the forums too
[16:45:50] <toddparker> but how we do it and how aggressive the threshold is a negotiation
[16:46:02] <johnbender> right
[16:46:19] <johnbender> and I take it we can't go back to the old scroll and go
[16:46:25] <toddparker> i think exposing an option is probably the best idea, even if it's not kosher
[16:46:32] <johnbender> yah
[16:46:35] <toddparker> that looks janky
[16:46:36] <johnbender> extenuating circumstances
[16:46:38] <toddparker> yeah
[16:47:30] <toddparker> let's sleep on it and come up with a plan
[16:47:49] <toddparker> worst case: just looks like it dropped the animation frames
[16:47:55] <toddparker> which is to be expected on big pages
[16:48:14] <toddparker> not shabby that worst case is the page transition is fast :)
[16:48:28] <toddparker> i'll take that over a 25 second page change or a crash
[16:52:56] <toddparker> heading out johnbender
[16:53:37] <johnbender> toddparker: kk talk with you tomorrow
