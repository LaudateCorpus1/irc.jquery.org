[06:43:39] <rwaldron> After a quick look, I want to say CONGRATS to you guys. Mobile ThemeRoller looks great
[06:44:04] <rwaldron> i <333 that you laid out the previews as narrow displays
[07:01:58] <rxaviers> all: any CSS wizard willing to give a little help?
[07:02:13] <rxaviers> Let me introduce myself, my name is Rafael Xavier and I'm building Editable widget on jq UI.
[07:03:17] <rxaviers> Basically, I need an input to expand its width to the remaining space in a div with float:right elements
[07:14:02] <Wilto> rxaviers: This channel is for the jQuery Mobile development team to collaborate—for general support questions, you’ll want to hit up #jquerymobile
[07:16:42] <Rwhitbeck> Congrats on releasing the Mobile Themeroller guys…looks awesome.
[07:19:00] <rxaviers> Wilto, I didnt mean to spam the channel, sorry and thanks for your warning... I have asked here, although knowing it's not the right place because I've been told we have brilliant staff here that maybe could help its cousing project. thanks and sorry again...
[07:19:54] <Wilto> Oh, no worries, man. I’m sure you’ll see a lot of overlap in terms of the names in the two channels—but, “everything in its place” and all.
[07:20:10] <Wilto> Thanks Rwhitbeck!
[07:20:48] <rxaviers> Wilto, ;)
[07:24:00] <toddparker> thanks rwalron
[07:24:23] <toddparker> thanks Rwhitbeck
[07:24:57] <Rwhitbeck> Been seeing a lot of oohs and ahhs over it.
[07:28:33] <toddparker> it's a fun tool to play with
[08:26:33] <JNice> theme roller is the bee's knees
[08:27:19] <JNice> kuler integration is a big win too... great job guys
[08:40:38] <jzaefferer> hey toddmparker_ et al, congrats on the themeroller release! now we really really need to migrate jQuery UI to the new CSS framework, would be great to get some help there
[08:43:14] <eddiemonge> what new framework?
[08:43:38] <jzaefferer> what jQuery Mobile is using
[08:43:45] <jzaefferer> its basically jQuery UI CSS framework v2
[08:45:02] <eddiemonge> has there been any work on it yet?
[08:45:29] <eddiemonge> kinblas: is tyler in today?
[08:46:54] <jzaefferer> eddiemonge: nothing substantial as far as I know
[08:47:53] <kinblas> eddiemonge: I believe so
[08:48:47] <kinblas> jzaefferer: uniting them would be great! We get questions on that, and the incompatibilities all the time
[08:49:09] <eddiemonge> jzaefferer: do you want the files separated out like in jqm for structure and themes?
[08:51:18] <jzaefferer> eddiemonge: of course, we've got that already
[08:52:24] <gseguin> eddiemonge: thanks for the fixes yesterday
[08:52:42] <eddiemonge> gseguin: only thank me if we dont get issues from them
[08:52:55] <gseguin> heh
[08:59:52] <kinblas> johnbender: toddparker: you guys dialed in?
[09:02:29] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm here
[09:02:37] <johnbender> how is it that I keep missing these HN opportunities
[09:03:24] <johnbender> I refer of course to theme roller
[09:03:36] <eddiemonge> hn?
[09:05:53] <kinblas> johnbender: HN?
[09:08:51] <toddmparker_> hey all
[09:08:57] <toddmparker_> on on irc now full time
[09:09:02] <toddmparker_> irccloud
[09:09:09] <toddmparker_> backchannel
[09:09:23] <toddmparker_> jzaefferer: sure, i'm here to help!
[09:09:52] <gseguin> eddiemonge, kinblas: I'm guessing Hacker News
[09:10:00] <jzaefferer> toddmparker_: we moved that discussion over to #jqueryui-dev
[09:11:46] <Wilto> oh god i’m so bad at talking
[09:19:33] * johnbender dances a little jig
[09:19:45] <Wilto> Wooyeah.
[09:21:13] <eddiemonge> how feasible would it be to change all .ui-xx classes to .m-xx
[09:21:29] <johnbender> eddiemonge: sed and your done right!?!? lol
[09:21:36] <johnbender> you're*
[09:21:44] <eddiemonge> exactly!
[09:22:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: you have some interferance or crosstalk coming through your end, it's not super bad
[09:22:46] <johnbender> interference
[09:22:47] <johnbender> ugh
[09:23:00] * johnbender is worthless where spelling is concerned
[09:23:45] <Wilto> eddiemonge: I think that’s totally doable, but… Just makes me uneasy, so close to 1.0.
[09:24:09] <johnbender> Wilto: yah I think he means post 1.0
[09:24:09] <eddiemonge> if we were to do it, that would be the time to do it
[09:24:20] <Wilto> Ah, okay, sweet.
[09:24:37] <johnbender> eddiemonge: we've actually talked about it
[09:28:26] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I guess I missed the call but I did not get an invite for it nor do I know the number
[09:32:51] <toddmparker_> ah sorry!
[09:32:58] <gseguin> no worries
[09:33:04] <toddmparker_> gesguin - we scheduled this wile you were out
[10:02:56] <johnbender> tbenzige: do you have a twitter account?
[10:03:09] <johnbender> I have some folks who are big fans of the themeroller and you deserve the credit
[10:08:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to post my findings to the Mango select menu thread and include that in the email as well
[10:08:32] * johnbender discards his damnable pride
[10:13:17] <toddmparker_> yeah tbenzige - i was hunting your on google last night for a homepage or twitter
[10:13:22] <toddmparker_> meant to email you
[10:14:08] <toddmparker_> good idea johnbender
[10:15:37] <tbenzige> johnbender: toddmparker_: my twitter is tybenz
[10:15:51] <toddmparker_> i'll link it up now
[10:15:55] <toddmparker_> tbenzige:
[10:17:40] <toddmparker_> geez tbenzige that is one bare twitter account
[10:17:44] <toddmparker_> did you just create it?
[10:17:55] <tbenzige> no
[10:17:58] <tbenzige> i just dont tweet
[10:18:21] <tbenzige> i created a long time ago and never used it
[10:19:02] <Wilto> But… But where do you complain about public transit? Or swear at browsers?
[10:19:02] <toddmparker_> you're famous now, you need to tweet
[10:20:22] <Wilto> Go get you some internet fame, man.
[10:20:48] <toddmparker_> so tbenzige - i can still see that broken saved theme issue
[10:21:16] <toddmparker_> does this open for you? http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/index.php?style_id=20111028-2
[10:21:24] <toddmparker_> the link worked when i clicked from the blog
[10:21:36] <toddmparker_> but now if i refresh or hack the url, i get a busted preview
[10:21:40] <toddmparker_> so odd
[10:21:43] <toddmparker_> crome/mac
[10:21:49] <toddmparker_> chrome ^
[10:24:01] <toddmparker_> can you guys test this
[10:24:10] <toddmparker_> on my machine chrome and FF, i can load this
[10:24:26] <toddmparker_> but if i edit the number at the end or just refresh the preview is busted
[10:24:34] <toddmparker_> BUT if i add www. if looks ok
[10:24:46] <toddmparker_> internal network wonkiness here?
[10:29:31] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge, johnbender, kinblas gseguin ^^
[10:29:36] <toddmparker_> anyone seeing url oddness
[10:29:58] <toddmparker_> also, once i add www. if see this URL that works but is odd
[10:30:04] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com///themeroller/index.php?style_id=20111028-6
[10:30:09] <toddmparker_> why the ///
[10:30:57] <eddiemonge> url rewrites maybe?
[10:31:44] <Wilto> What’s this thing run on? Apache usually normalizes that stuff by default, I think.
[10:31:59] <kinblas> toddmparker: hmmm maybe a bug in the script that generates the URL
[10:32:17] <toddmparker_> could be
[10:32:44] <eddiemonge> Wilto: its apache
[10:34:06] <toddmparker_> may only be an issue if you hack urls like i havebeen
[10:34:36] <toddmparker_> if you leave in the /// the www issue goes away
[10:35:32] <toddmparker_> well, sorta
[10:35:45] <kinblas> oh hmmm, that is strange
[10:35:55] <Wilto> Yeah, officially bizarre.
[10:38:03] <kinblas> strange thing is there's a redirect too right?
[10:38:12] <kinblas> www.jquerymobile.com changes to jquerymobile.com
[10:38:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did you get the email I sent to the MS guys?
[10:42:02] <johnbender> you were cc'd
[10:43:00] <toddmparker_> lemme look johnbender
[10:43:45] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/4fa6ccdc0d8625f58e43e446f24bc4e65f87cb1d
[10:43:46] <toddmparker_> awesome johnbender
[10:43:47] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by jblas (1m, 5d ago): Fix for issue 2315 - Flip toggle switch with change event bound, triggers multiple times- Modified refresh() so that it checks to see if the value actually changed before firing off the "change" event.
[10:43:57] <johnbender> just wanted to check in with you on that
[10:44:00] <toddmparker_> feels so good to show bugs to msft
[10:44:04] <johnbender> toddmparker_: :D
[10:44:06] <toddmparker_> web dev fantast time
[10:44:14] <johnbender> lol
[10:45:50] <kinblas> johnbender: that bug was bout the fact that in certain cases you could manipulate the switch and it would trigger twice setting it back to what the value was originally. Along with that, there was the case where you could flip the switch with the mouse down and then change your mind and slide it back, but then the switch would flip to the other state.
[10:48:28] <toddmparker_> danheberden: any ideas on these url issues above ^^
[10:49:41] <johnbender> kinblas: good to know
[10:49:55] <johnbender> it caused an issue where the slider would sit visually in the center of its two positions
[10:50:21] <toddmparker_> yeah, kinda get hung up
[10:50:21] <johnbender> todd merged in a change the other night to fix it that was some pretty heafty js changes
[10:50:23] <kinblas> lol
[10:50:26] <kinblas> undecided
[10:50:27] <johnbender> so I wanted to take a look at it today
[10:50:40] <johnbender> hah
[10:50:46] <kinblas> grrr, why does it sit in the middle? The refresh() method is supposed to pick a side
[10:50:47] <johnbender> you created a "vacilating" state
[10:50:59] <kinblas> sounds kinky
[10:51:10] <kinblas> how so?
[10:51:16] <johnbender> kinblas: http://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=vacilating&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
[10:51:38] <toddmparker_> oooh SAT word time
[10:52:17] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm going to try and take care of it today, I need a quick win after all this wp7 uglyness
[10:52:29] <johnbender> hands off!
[10:52:30] <johnbender> lol
[10:52:38] <kinblas> lol
[10:52:43] <kinblas> go ahead I'm doing perf stuff
[10:52:48] <kinblas> some interesting finds
[10:52:50] <johnbender> oooh fun
[10:53:00] <kinblas> 500-700msecs to load a document off wifi network
[10:53:06] <kinblas> followed by 1200msecs to enhance
[10:53:14] <kinblas> this is on iPad 4.3.2
[10:53:42] <kinblas> note that the numbers get worst over 3G
[10:53:51] <danheberden> it only busts for me if i add the www, the extra /// shouldn't matter except to force a cache reset
[10:53:57] <danheberden> since it's technically a different url
[10:54:23] <kinblas> I think we need to figure out who is generating that though
[10:54:28] <kinblas> if it's our script we need to fix it
[10:54:43] <kinblas> paths with /// might confuse mobile :-D
[10:55:24] <danheberden> it definitely feels apache/rewrites  - remove the /// and add www, immediately fires to the /// variant
[10:55:34] <danheberden> or a // variant
[11:05:43] <johnbender> kinblas: :(
[11:07:11] <tbenzige> danheberden: how come it only does the // or /// thing in webkit browsers?
[11:12:09] <toddmparker_> tbenzige: think i was seeing /// in firefox too
[11:12:47] <tbenzige> ok youre right. my bad
[11:13:16] <tbenzige> the thing is though the layout error is only occuring in safari/chrome
[11:19:53] <toddmparker_> odd
[11:33:06] <toddmparker_> johnbender and kinblas - do we support ? synatax in urls
[11:33:07] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2859#issuecomment-2553981
[11:33:07] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2859 on jquery-mobile, reported by StevePo (1d, 10h ago): Previous visited url hash is somehow loaded again
[11:33:16] <toddmparker_> #somePage?someId=1
[11:33:16] <toddmparker_> #somePage?someId=2
[11:33:47] <kinblas> toddmparker: we don't support args to internal pages
[11:33:59] <kinblas> there is however a project that provides that support via a plugin
[11:34:01] <toddmparker_> seems like passing params in the url should work
[11:34:05] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[11:34:14] <kinblas> you can pass params to a file path
[11:34:16] <toddmparker_> you know where
[11:34:17] <kinblas> but not an id
[11:34:24] <kinblas> yeah checkout 450
[11:34:29] <toddmparker_> but we we just ignore the params in our history
[11:35:00] <kinblas> I don't think we will visit that hash again btw anymore
[11:35:12] <kinblas> I fixed things so that we error out if we try to go to an embedded page that doesn't exist
[11:35:23] <kinblas> I think the nav code will attempt to look for a div with an id of
[11:35:29] <kinblas> "somePage?someId=1"
[11:35:39] <kinblas> because it's not a path
[11:37:03] <toddmparker_> so this
[11:37:03] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/azicchetti/jquerymobile-router
[11:37:08] <toddmparker_> that is an intense ticket
[11:37:12] <kinblas> yeah
[11:37:17] <kinblas> lol
[11:37:19] <kinblas> yeah
[11:37:19] <toddmparker_> do we address query params in the docs at all
[11:37:29] <kinblas> yes we handle those just fine
[11:37:35] <kinblas> I mean things like
[11:39:20] <toddmparker_> kinblas ...
[11:39:32] <toddmparker_> the anticipation
[11:40:10] <toddmparker_> just wondering how you'd respond to that issue above
[11:40:36] <toddmparker_> it seems broken ont he surface, like we use the same params on every page
[11:41:03] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: did that search clear stuff get pulled in?
[11:41:18] <eddiemonge> yea
[11:41:55] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:42:02] <toddmparker_> just saw gseguin oulled in in
[11:42:05] <toddmparker_> nice fix
[11:42:21] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.forms.textinput.js#L62:L70
[11:42:39] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:43:24] <kinblas> foo.com/blah?a=1&b=2
[11:43:31] <kinblas> sorry todd network hiccup
[11:43:59] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I was saying that we handle normal query strings *WITH* file paths just fine
[11:44:07] <kinblas> we just don't support query strings with ids
[11:44:16] <karlsberg87> hello
[11:44:39] <karlsberg87> hello toddmparker_
[11:44:48] <toddmparker_> so we don't kill params but we don't do anything with them - directing to pages and such
[11:44:54] <toddmparker_> mind replying?
[11:45:04] <toddmparker_> hey karlsberg87
[11:45:21] <toddmparker_> i responded to your Q at least once...you must have missed it
[11:45:32] <karlsberg87> where?
[11:45:49] <toddmparker_> it was here on -dev
[11:45:56] <toddmparker_> think the second time you asked for me
[11:46:06] <karlsberg87> emm,, i dont see or not remember
[11:46:07] <toddmparker_> things get missed on irc
[11:46:18] <toddmparker_> so what's up
[11:46:24] <karlsberg87> im talking you in private
[11:51:25] <miketaylr> any of youse guys seen this tiggr jquerymobile IDE thingy?
[11:51:26] <miketaylr> https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dddmh3rp_286djqvwtdw&pli=1
[11:51:38] * miketaylr was just on a call with one of their devrel guys
[11:51:57] <miketaylr> (starting at slide 7)
[11:54:07] <eddiemonge> so its web based phonegap using jquery mobile?
[11:54:23] <eddiemonge> i saw it mentioned last week but hadnt looked into it
[11:54:24] <miketaylr> yeah, kinda
[11:54:51] <miketaylr> seems neat if you're into the whole IDE-builder style of dev
[11:56:04] <eddiemonge> i was upset at their choice of names
[11:56:12] <miketaylr> at tiggr?
[11:56:13] <miketaylr> haha
[11:57:46] <eddiemonge> yeah
[11:57:49] <eddiemonge> i love tiggr
[11:57:55] <eddiemonge> and its so close to my alt name
[11:59:06] <miketaylr> i'm sure they'll be sued into oblivion by disney if they ever get big
[12:04:22] <toddmparker_> seems cool miketaylr
[12:04:36] <miketaylr> yeah, kinda neat
[12:04:40] <toddmparker_> i tried it a long time ago and was sort of confused by the interface but i'm sure it's better
[12:04:44] <toddmparker_> and i'm not a dev
[12:04:47] <miketaylr> heh
[12:05:03] <miketaylr> my very first exposure to CSS was through 18 dreamweaver panels back in the day
[12:05:14] <miketaylr> i thought, there is no way anyone can learn this--it's impossible :P
[12:05:20] <miketaylr> turns out it was just the interface
[12:07:32] <Wilto> I still think it might be impossible, miketaylr.
[12:08:25] <Wilto> Me, I’m a drag-and-drop Dreamweaver guy.
[12:09:32] <miketaylr> it's amazing how complex a couple hundred select boxes can make something feel
[12:13:11] <Wilto> I secretly live in fear of the day you guys believe something I say about my work process.
[12:13:51] <toddmparker_> go figure miketaylr
[12:14:12] <toddmparker_> Wilto is more of a frontpage kinda guy
[12:14:22] <Wilto> Exactly.
[12:14:24] <toddmparker_> says dreamweaver is "scarey"
[12:14:43] <Wilto> Dude, “code view?” What is this, The Matrix? AmIrite?
[12:14:46] <miketaylr> i will not disagree
[12:14:50] <Wilto> Nobody can read that stuff.
[12:15:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_:
[12:15:05] <johnbender> just to chime in
[12:15:05] <johnbender> #somePage?someId=1
[12:15:31] <johnbender> what comes after the ? in that string is technically still part of the hash fragment
[12:15:44] <johnbender> or at least that's what I remember from the spec
[12:15:50] <johnbender> we've answered that question a ton of times
[12:17:02] <johnbender> as kind mentioned we'd have to support that explicitly
[12:17:10] <johnbender> *kin mentioned
[12:18:22] <kinblas> miketaylr: I suppose it was a better choice than "pooh"
[12:18:28] <miketaylr> heh
[12:26:46] <johnbender> kinblas: ZING!
[12:27:10] <kinblas> heh
[12:33:03] <toddmparker_> so johnbender and kinblas
[12:33:24] <toddmparker_> do we discuss this in the docs anywhere?
[12:33:29] <toddmparker_> i can add it
[12:34:15] * kinblas feels so behind on things
[12:34:28] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I haven't forgotten about the phonegap docs
[12:35:51] <toddmparker_> yeah, yeah
[12:35:55] <toddmparker_> dog ate your docs, etc.
[12:43:13] <Wilto> kinblas: And we were all ready to put those docs up on the fridge, too.
[12:45:29] <toddmparker_> kinblas: you see this commit message
[12:45:30] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/47812171f10ee1b28dcc63615cb4a764fb49d2da#commitcomment-681086
[12:45:31] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by jblas (4w, 21h ago): Fixes #2570 - Refreshing a page with #&ui-state=dialog causes syntax error- This was a regression from my fix to loadPage() for detecting un-enhanced pages by @id as a fallback. In this particular case dataUrl was being used to create an id selector, and of course if the dataUrl is an empty string we end up using "#" as the selector. The fix is to simply check for a no
[12:45:42] <toddmparker_> Not fixed!
[12:45:42] <toddmparker_> Situation: several pages in one body. Page 1 opens page 2 as dialog. Page 2 can be closed any old way, but the result will be either the syntax error 'unrecognized expression: x' or a jump back to the page before Page 1 in browser history.

[12:53:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: he meant well, and I've made mistakes like that from time to time too
[12:53:34] <toddmparker_> oh i know
[12:53:41] <toddmparker_> just made me checkle
[12:53:41] <johnbender> just glad we have that many people using the framework :D
[12:53:44] <toddmparker_> chuckle
[12:53:51] <toddmparker_> yep
[12:57:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm working on reverting that commit
[12:57:59] <johnbender> though I'm attempting to keep his tests
[12:58:19] <johnbender> that is, I'm reverting only the css and the /js changes

[13:07:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2824 on jquery-mobile, reported by samdz (4d, 1h ago): version 1.0 RC2 Dynamic content loses CSS after clicking browser Refresh
[13:13:49] <kinblas> danheberden: toddmparker_: I'm working with Tyler to try and figure out the un-styled preview in ThemeRoller
[13:14:00] <kinblas> problem is we can't repro it in our own localhost servers
[13:14:17] <kinblas> is there a way we can get a private directory on the server where it is reproduceable so we can debug it?
[13:14:33] <kinblas> we need to be able to tweak source in said directory so we can add debugging statements
[13:14:48] <danheberden> shouldn't that be working on themeroller-test?
[13:14:58] <danheberden> or, rather, the same issues?
[13:15:06] <kinblas> danheberden: but in order to get source there, we have to check in debug stuff to git?
[13:16:13] <danheberden> yeah - so 3 options: 1) commit debug stuff 2) commit debug stuff, figure it all out, reset the head 3) log into the server directly and modify the files
[13:16:26] <danheberden> for #3, i'll need your ssh key
[13:17:52] <toddmparker_> thanks for looking at that kinblas and danheberden
[13:18:06] <kinblas> danheberden: ok, let me dig up my ssh key (or generate a new one)
[13:18:16] <kinblas> I switched machines and might have misplaced it along the way
[13:20:46] <tbenzige> danheberden: i just sent you mine
[13:21:28] <danheberden> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
[13:21:32] <danheberden> will put it into the clipboard on a mac
[13:21:39] <danheberden> thanks tbenzige
[13:21:45] <Wilto> Waaait, how do we know this “danheberden” character can be trusted..?
[13:21:58] * danheberden dodges eye contact
[13:28:25] <kinblas> danheberden: sent you mine
[13:37:32] <danheberden> i'll send you mine if you send me yours?
[13:37:36] * danheberden fails at jokes
[13:44:59] <kinblas> danheberden: I can get in but the files are 755 so I can't write them
[13:45:12] <danheberden> just sudo
[13:45:18] <danheberden> sudo vim ...
[13:47:22] <kinblas> duh ok
[13:47:26] <kinblas> thanks!
[14:10:35] <johnbender> brb going for a quick lunch walk with the wife and child
[14:10:58] <kinblas> toddparker: I think we found the cause, we're hashing out the solution
[14:18:44] <toddmparker_> great news kinblas
[14:27:12] <toddmparker_> what's y'alls opinion in diabling links? feels odd

[14:27:15] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2603 on jquery-mobile, reported by jpfiset (3w, 3d ago): Add ability to disable/enable buttons in navbar
[14:27:22] <toddmparker_> but people do ask for it.
[14:27:32] <toddmparker_> just don't like it
[14:34:44] <toddmparker_> bizarre bug: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2814
[14:34:44] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2814 on jquery-mobile, reported by jshepler (6d, 3h ago): image type submit buttons not handled correctly
[14:38:16] <toddmparker_> you pass x,y coords when you click an input type=image
[14:38:21] <toddmparker_> and .net freaks if you don't
[14:38:28] <toddmparker_> like old skool imagemaps
[14:43:00] <eddiemonge> anyone have an iOS 4.3 device?
[14:45:16] <kinblas> eddiemonge: I do
[14:45:19] <danheberden> i'm 4.3.3
[14:45:37] <danheberden> on both iphone/ipad
[14:45:50] <kinblas> toddmparker_: just an fyi, we have a plan, most of it is done, tyler is just re-shuffling some code between 2 files, then he needs to test
[14:46:02] <toddmparker_> great news guys
[14:46:15] <kinblas> toddmparker_: basically there was a race condition between the iframe and domready
[14:46:25] <kinblas> we've elimnated the possibility of that happening now
[14:46:34] <toddmparker_> ah, makes some sense
[14:46:49] <kinblas> classic problem
[14:52:00] <eddiemonge> kinblas: danheberden can you test these instructions: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2847#issuecomment-2561511
[14:52:01] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2847 on jquery-mobile, reported by fudder (2d, 22h ago): Search inputs: Clear control does not react to cut and paste events in iOS
[14:55:00] <eddiemonge> hmm doesnt fix it on 4.x it seems
[14:57:43] <eddiemonge> timmywil: yt?
[14:59:59] <kinblas> eddiemonge: I still see the bug
[15:00:14] <kinblas> tested ipad 4.3.5
[15:02:07] <eddiemonge> im testing what event iOS has for paste pre-5
[15:04:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so after diving into that issue and fixing the specific ticket he referenced I decided to include his tests
[15:04:59] <johnbender> he covers two other cases which are legit
[15:05:04] <johnbender> and require more code change
[15:05:16] <toddmparker_> cool
[15:05:18] <johnbender> so I'm going to see why the tests fail on firefox
[15:05:24] <toddmparker_> good to hear there was some good stuff there
[15:05:26] <johnbender> and possibly leave the commit where it is
[15:05:36] <toddmparker_> sounds like wheat he did worked, but was a wee bit too much for now
