[04:56:44] <arschmitz> Morning uGoMobi
[04:56:57] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[04:57:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: can you still reproduce the problem with the persistant toolbar? i did it twice but then tried another 100 and couldnt
[04:57:52] <uGoMobi> i could yesterday
[04:57:57] <uGoMobi> every time
[04:58:08] <uGoMobi> but different issues
[04:58:46] <uGoMobi> like sometimes errrors loading page, sometimes multiple nav buttons get active state
[04:59:11] <arschmitz> i never got any errors
[04:59:16] <uGoMobi> every time when i returned to homepage the fixed toolbars were still on my screen
[04:59:28] <arschmitz> yeah i got it to do it twice last night
[04:59:32] <arschmitz> and then couldnt any more
[05:00:10] <uGoMobi> sometimes i got those errors in the log
[05:00:18] <uGoMobi> the errors i posted in here
[05:00:40] <arschmitz> yeah i saw them. is it still doing it now though?
[05:00:54] <arschmitz> oh ha go figure now i got the errors
[05:01:43] <arschmitz> some how it loaded jquerymobile.com into fixedtoolbars
[05:02:42] <arschmitz> how on earth is it trying to load jquerymobile.com???? 
[05:02:52] <uGoMobi> yeah sooo weird
[05:05:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:http://i.imgur.com/szhGr.jpg
[05:06:02] <arschmitz> the error are for stuff that isnt even in the docs its part of jquerymobile.com some how it didnt find footer-persist-c.html and redirected the ajax request to jquerymobile.com
[05:07:02] <uGoMobi> yeah i got the same thing on my screen
[05:07:28] <arschmitz> it seems like a base tag issue
[05:08:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:yup some how the base tag is set to http://jquerymobile.com/
[05:09:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[05:09:28] <uGoMobi> I was thinking maybe has to do with what we store in data-url
[05:09:41] <arschmitz> sounds reasonable
[05:10:07] <uGoMobi> made me think about that mobilePage that johnbender was asking about
[05:10:20] <arschmitz> yeah it does sound similar
[05:11:01] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/8cecf0d70587801e1a841fa44b6f69b90c355802
[05:11:05] <uGoMobi> that change
[05:13:37] <arschmitz> hmm i wonder let me look at fixedtoolbar and see if this looks like it would effect it some how
[05:14:17] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15aristotelos opened issue #5351: Copy classes from legend for controlgroup label  02http://git.io/hZ6iWQ
[05:19:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think there are 2 seperate issues here
[05:19:57] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:20:20] <arschmitz> the headers hanging around i see a clear issue with here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L167
[05:20:39] <arschmitz> we are adding them to the container then never removing them
[05:21:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but this should not effect the base tag in anyway that i can see 
[05:22:02] <arschmitz> and the base tag is not properly updating here
[05:24:11] <uGoMobi> right
[05:25:31] <arschmitz> hmmm its like data-dom-cache="true" is set on the persist pages even though it isnt too they are never removed from the dom
[05:26:13] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15aristotelos opened issue #5352: Buttons in the controlgroup label  02http://git.io/EqmDpQ
[05:27:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill fix the toolbars first just incase then see if this still happens i can reproduce both consistantly now
[05:28:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[05:28:26] <arschmitz> should i open an issue or just go ahead and fix?
[05:31:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe we should check if the issue is in 1.2.0
[05:31:15] <arschmitz> its not
[05:31:19] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:31:23] <arschmitz> i just checked
[05:31:36] <uGoMobi> then we don't really need a ticket if you can fix it right away
[05:31:49] <arschmitz> ok
[05:31:55] <uGoMobi> doesn't need to go in release notes or anything
[05:31:59] <uGoMobi> just a regression
[05:32:02] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:41:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this is weird. I just checked whats changed since 1.2 to cause the toolbars to not be removed. but in the fixedToolbar.js they are not removed in 1.2 either some other part of the code must have been doing it. any ideas?
[05:42:01] <uGoMobi> so the issue is not caused by something in toolbars?
[05:42:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ^^
[05:42:28] <uGoMobi> let me look into this
[05:42:29] <arschmitz> it would seem that way
[05:42:54] <arschmitz> though this is something that "should" be handeled by fixed toolbars i would think
[05:44:14] <uGoMobi> looks like something is going wrong with the container
[05:45:19] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:52:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no changes in transitions.js either
[05:52:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i cant find how the persistant toolbars were removed from the page container before i cant find where its done
[05:53:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we might have to do a git bisect
[05:54:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont know why they would have been removed anywhere besides in the fixedToolbar widget?
[06:00:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think the issue has to do with that mobilePage
[06:01:08] <uGoMobi> in fixedToolbar we track persistent toolbars
[06:01:33] <uGoMobi> in that code we use nextPage object
[06:02:27] <arschmitz> yes
[06:04:01] <uGoMobi> i think there must be something wrong with that
[06:04:19] <arschmitz> i still cant see where the toolbars were removed before though something removed them from the page container
[06:04:53] <arschmitz> maybe something in the pageRemove
[06:07:20] <arschmitz> i think i see
[06:08:50] <arschmitz> i think it has something to do with removeWithDependants
[06:10:29] <uGoMobi> ah that function
[06:10:40] <uGoMobi> we use it for nested listviews
[06:10:59] <uGoMobi> also for fixed toolbars?
[06:11:24] <arschmitz> im not sure im trying to figure it out
[06:11:35] <uGoMobi> that code is not really how it should according to the widget factory if i remember well
[06:11:49] <uGoMobi> should be*
[06:12:07] <arschmitz> no the fixed toolbars are being removed outside the widget which should not be
[06:12:12] <arschmitz> im trying to figure out where
[06:13:03] <arschmitz> hmm im probably wrong on that actually ill keep looking
[06:28:39] <arschmitz> ok i did a hard reset to 8cecf0d70587801e1a841fa44b6f69b90c355802 (the commit from nix) and it fixes the problem
[06:29:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so its either that or something since then (i couldnt just revert the commit because other once sense depend on it and i didnt want to track them down lol)
[06:35:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are we sure the problem came with that commit? or could it be some other commit that came after it?
[06:35:41] <arschmitz> no im not sure at all
[06:35:58] <arschmitz> thats what i was saying that its either that OR something since then
[06:36:14] <arschmitz> im trying to reset to the next commit after that now to see if it happens then
[06:50:46] <uGoMobi> ah... you meant "other ones since"...I get it
[06:51:08] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:51:09] <uGoMobi> you can do this with git bisect
[06:51:20] <uGoMobi> but I am not very experienced with that
[06:51:28] <arschmitz> me either
[06:51:45] <arschmitz> maybe its time for me to get some experience with it
[06:52:21] <uGoMobi> yeah it might be a good opportunity to check it out
[06:54:28] <arschmitz> wow bisect does a lot
[06:55:30] <arschmitz> i have to run to a short meeting ill continue on tracking this down when i get back
[07:01:25] <toddmparker> arschmitz and uGoMobi - those are some bizarre issues
[07:01:27] <toddmparker> http://i.imgur.com/szhGr.jpg
[07:01:30] <toddmparker> ^^ woah.
[07:01:40] <toddmparker> also, good morning
[07:01:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah I didn't know what I saw yesterday
[07:02:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah im just not sure right now if we have one issue or two
[07:02:03] <toddmparker> scott jehl is doing a cleanup / performance pass on panels today, jlembeck is finishing tests
[07:02:07] <uGoMobi> yeah good morning
[07:02:22] <toddmparker> so curious what this ends up being
[07:02:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: on Android Jelly Bean the panel transitions don't work very smooth
[07:02:56] <uGoMobi> but i guess you guys already noticed
[07:03:18] <uGoMobi> on Chrome panels look really great though... nice work!
[07:05:30] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: thanks. if you look on a desktop machine, things look pretty good. we're feature complete and the api is solid
[07:05:44] <toddmparker> just need this to work well on iPad and Android especially
[07:06:06] <toddmparker> funny thing is it looks good on older devices because we're using offsets
[07:06:27] <toddmparker> on these newer devices, we're using translateX because it's way smoother, but also blinker :/
[07:06:45] <toddmparker> we're going to make some pretty big css changes today and see how this shakes out
[07:06:50] <toddmparker> we'r eclose tho
[07:07:03] <uGoMobi> ah yeah I can see that
[07:07:03] <toddmparker> how are we on 1.3 items?
[07:07:10] <toddmparker> i need to check the open tickets
[07:07:35] <toddmparker> takes a lot of work to go from prototype to a real plugin. learning that.
[07:08:29] <uGoMobi> oh yes for sure
[07:09:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am working now on the open tickets for 1.3 that have the "demo" label
[07:09:16] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great
[07:09:40] <toddmparker> once panels are done, we can drop those into the new demos folder and start hashing out a plan for the org
[07:09:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you push the changes you made to the new range widget?
[07:10:15] <toddmparker> i have a meeting til 1:00
[07:10:22] <toddmparker> i'll pop in when i can, sorry
[07:10:31] <uGoMobi> ok see you later
[07:10:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes no problem it will just be a little while
[07:10:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah sure no hurry
[07:41:40] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! Quick checkin: Did I break anything else besides the checkboxes?
[07:51:24] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[07:51:28] <uGoMobi> not sure yet
[07:52:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we are looking at this commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/8cecf0d70587801e1a841fa44b6f69b90c355802
[07:53:07] <uGoMobi> that might have caused persistent toolbars to break, but arschmitz checking that now
[08:16:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aha, that was a consequence of updating the widget factory.
[08:17:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I did see some discussion about persistent toolbars showing up on the docs main page. Not good.
[08:17:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah you get to see the most weird things when you visit that page in the docs
[08:18:00] <_|Nix|_> Wow!
[08:18:02] <uGoMobi> and after you left it
[08:18:17] <_|Nix|_> Great. I break things and then I take off :)
[08:18:23] <uGoMobi> haha
[08:18:30] <_|Nix|_> I'm a drive-by hacker.
[08:18:31] <uGoMobi> not saying you broke that
[08:18:33] <uGoMobi> (yet)
[08:18:40] <_|Nix|_> LOL :)
[08:18:41] <uGoMobi> :
[08:18:42] <uGoMobi> :D
[08:19:06] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I gotta go wake up my daughter from her afternoon nap, or she'll never go to bed tonight ...
[08:19:09] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[08:19:12] <_|Nix|_> Good luck!
[08:19:17] <uGoMobi> ok later
[08:40:18] <gseguin> Good mornin'
[08:48:53] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[09:00:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I know this might be a tall order but can I ask you to help me debug these sequence tests with the merge?
[09:00:54] <johnbender> everything else is working but I can't get the failures to reproduce consistently
[09:01:10] <johnbender> which makes it fairly impossible to address them
[09:11:03] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ I know this might be a tall order but can I ask you to help me debug these sequence tests with the merge? I can't get them to reproduce consistently (I think there's a comment in there about the fact that they are order dependent?) and every other test in our suite is passing including the ones that overlap a lot of this stuff
[09:11:04] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[09:44:49] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ I wouldn't otherwise ask but I've been doing this for about a month 8 hours a day and, well, I'm tired of it :)
[09:44:49] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.

[10:35:11] <toddmparker> agenda ^^
[10:44:14] <RWhitbeck> One week my name will be already on the agenda ;-)
[10:48:02] <Wilto> In fairness: he doesn’t even put my name on there, and I sit five feet away from him. Crying.
[10:48:11] <Wilto> always crying
[10:50:33] <RWhitbeck> isn't there a gif to sum up your feelings?
[10:51:31] <gseguin> http://wil.to/_/sad-house.gif
[11:02:44] <RWhitbeck> see I knew there was one. 
[11:03:04] <RWhitbeck> meeting time
[11:03:37] <toddmparker> yep!
[11:25:16] <Wilto> Todd: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/unprefixed-transitions
[12:20:02] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hey Jasper, I can think of some content if you like... any idea what sort of content you're after?
[12:20:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think a list of notifications
[12:20:59] <uGoMobi> like an inbox
[12:21:11] <uGoMobi> I could create them
[12:21:17] <agcolom> ok... otherwise a todolist could work as well..
[12:21:28] * kpepin brb
[12:21:37] <agcolom> but I like the idea of an inbox as you said. everyone is familiar with that :-)
[12:21:40] <uGoMobi> but I thought... if someone already has a listview with content like that it saves time
[12:22:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah to do list is good idea too
[12:22:19] <uGoMobi> could even be a mixture
[12:22:36] <agcolom> I'll try to find that email demo Todd was talking about. I remember it... should be able to find it...
[12:23:05] <uGoMobi> yeah maybe I have the link too somewhere but don't remember where either
[12:23:09] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks!
[12:23:13] <toddmparker> boo
[12:23:31] * kpepin back
[12:23:43] <uGoMobi> so grid listviews
[12:23:54] <toddmparker> yep, grid. list. views.
[12:23:54] <kpepin> :)
[12:23:58] <uGoMobi> I say +1 to just a demo
[12:24:05] <toddmparker> how 'bout those?
[12:24:07] <kpepin> Cool.  :)
[12:24:22] <toddmparker> I think that probably makes sense given the timing
[12:24:27] <toddmparker> if kpepin 
[12:24:30] <kpepin> The modification to the JS file (if memory serves) was just to add the namespacing class.
[12:24:41] <toddmparker> can make a stylesheet with the overrides, we can toss it into a demo
[12:24:57] <kpepin> That can easily be something that an external function adds to a wrapper DIV in a demo.
[12:24:57] <toddmparker> namespacing for...
[12:25:10] <kpepin> namespacing for the CSS changes.
[12:25:29] <uGoMobi> I have written the CSS to do the override some time ago
[12:25:36] <kpepin> So yes, I think the whole thing can simply be CSS overrides.
[12:25:52] <uGoMobi> kpepin: I am not sure the CSS in your PR overrides the listview CSS
[12:26:07] <uGoMobi> my idea is to put it in a MQ
[12:26:07] <kpepin> The demo I wrote up at the summit was almost all just CSS.  The JS was just to switch views around.
[12:26:16] <uGoMobi> regular list on mobile
[12:26:21] <kpepin> Exactly what it does uGoMobi.
[12:26:27] <kpepin> MQ?
[12:26:31] <uGoMobi> switch to grid on tablet / desktop
[12:26:35] <uGoMobi> mediq query
[12:26:38] <uGoMobi> media*
[12:26:42] <kpepin> Gotcha.
[12:27:03] <uGoMobi> ah that's great kpepin
[12:27:17] <uGoMobi> then just copy the CSS to a demo page
[12:27:26] <uGoMobi> CSS should go in the head
[12:28:07] <uGoMobi> in the folder docs/demos on master is a subfolder _demo-template
[12:28:29] <uGoMobi> you can copy that one
[12:28:37] <kpepin> The way we had done the POC, the grid was liquid, so it would automatically adapt to almost any break point.  The inline-block version would look even better since it could do elements aligned left, center or   right.
[12:28:43] <gnarf> hey guys
[12:29:00] <agcolom> uGoMobi: http://filamentgroup.com/scott-temp/jqm-mail/
[12:29:09] <uGoMobi> agcolom: great, thanks!
[12:29:25] <agcolom> you're welcome :-)
[12:29:28] <uGoMobi> hey gnarf 
[12:29:57] <gnarf> random request - if more of you have time to lurk #jquery watching for mobile support type things you might be able to offer help with, I'd appreciate having a few more solid knowledgeable responses around like arschmitz to CC on requests... Any volunteers?
[12:30:09] <uGoMobi> kpepin: issue with inline block is the 3px spacing browsers add
[12:30:54] <arschmitz> gnarf: im always in there just never paying attention so always feel free to ping me on something like you did last night
[12:31:17] <gnarf> arschmitz: yeah - hold on - random idea
[12:31:21] <uGoMobi> gnarf: I will check that channel more often now we closed #jquerymobile
[12:32:41] <toddmparker> good find agcolom 
[12:32:58] <gnarf> uGoMobi: okay, I'll try to remember to mention you by name when I see something I think you might be able to help with.
[12:33:07] <toddmparker> that mail app could use our push panel now too
[12:33:09] <kpepin> True uGoMobi, but that could be acceptable cor something you wanted centered.  The POC I did used floats, but I always intended to add inline-block as well to allow for aligning the text.  The demo would feature (ideally) a button set with buttons for float left, right and inline-block text align center, left and right just to show what is possible.
[12:33:17] <gnarf> uGoMobi: what would you say your "area" of expertise is
[12:33:24] <agcolom> toddmparker: It's useful to have a full inbox sometimes ;-) 
[12:33:35] <uGoMobi> gnarf: CSS
[12:34:35] <uGoMobi> kpepin: ok nice
[12:35:25] <kpepin> :)
[12:35:32] <uGoMobi> kpepin: let's start to have a basic example up there and then look at what other things we can add without breaking it :)
[12:36:33] <kpepin> So like I mentioned, Friday I have a half day off, and I was planning on using the time to bring the markup up to the standards in your docs, and then add in the inline examples, and refactor the original POC so that the JS modification wasn't needed.
[12:36:45] <uGoMobi> kpepin: we could always do a basic and more complex example
[12:36:49] <kpepin> Nothing should break.  :)
[12:36:58] <kpepin> Exactly.
[12:37:03] <kpepin> Exactly.
[12:37:09] <uGoMobi> kpepin: I am here all day tomorrow
[12:37:34] <toddmparker> great, sounds like a plan
[12:37:37] <uGoMobi> so I can help you out with moving it to the demos section
[12:37:53] <uGoMobi> or setup an empty page for you
[12:38:26] <toddmparker> jlembeck just finished all the panel unit tests…we're green
[12:38:36] <toddmparker> wish css was so straightforward
[12:38:41] <uGoMobi> ah that's great!
[12:39:17] <kpepin> Sorry about that. Laptop decided that exact moment was a good time to run out of memory and quit all apps.
[12:39:50] * kpepin is on his desktop now.  Again, sorry for the abrupt departure.
[12:40:01] <uGoMobi> kpepin: np
[12:40:06] <uGoMobi> didn't miss anything
[12:40:44] <kpepin> So yeah, we could use the original POC concept as a basic demo, and then show all the other modes as a mroe advanced demo if you like/prefer.

[12:43:23] <kpepin> No response?
[12:43:28] <uGoMobi> kpepin: great, let's do that
[12:43:33] <kpepin> :)
[12:43:45] <kpepin> Ok, cool.  I'll consider those my marchign orders for Friday then.
[12:44:08] <uGoMobi> not all developers are that good with CSS so in general it might be good if they can first see the basics
[12:44:12] <kpepin> I'll look for the template you mentioned as well, so things can be more easily integrated into the new demos pages.
[12:44:17] <uGoMobi> before we take it to the next leve
[12:44:21] <uGoMobi> level*
[12:44:22] <kpepin> I hear you.
[12:44:23] <kpepin> :)
[12:44:50] <kpepin> <-- not necessarily that good with CSS either (no expert anyway).
[12:45:09] <uGoMobi> kpepin: I created a view source code feature for the demos
[12:45:23] <uGoMobi> that template page shows how that works
[12:45:27] <kpepin> I saw you mentionign that in the meeting.  Awesome.  :)
[12:45:43] <kpepin> Very cool.  I'll take a peak.  
[12:46:06] <kpepin> Anythign else we need to run through for grid?
[12:46:19] * kpepin has been beating folks away from his cube for 15 minutes now.
[12:46:29] <uGoMobi> kpepin: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/_demo-template/index.html
[12:46:39] <kpepin> Fantastic, thank you.  :)
[12:46:39] <uGoMobi> kpepin: nope
[12:46:49] <uGoMobi> and if so... we can discuss it tomorrow
[12:47:15] <kpepin> Ok, cool.  I'll bring my laptop home with me so I can log into the dev channel as well.
[12:47:33] <uGoMobi> perfect
[12:47:34] <kpepin> I'm goign to sign off now and will be back later.  :)
[12:47:49] <uGoMobi> ok good night kpepin 
[12:47:53] <kpepin> Thanks again!
[12:56:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Wilto want to merge branch unprefixed-transitions or wait?
[12:56:19] <Wilto> Cool with me, sir.

[12:58:51] <toddmparker> +1
[12:59:57] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:04:36] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: is this a demo only or will it be part of the core library
[13:04:37] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5045
[13:04:48] <toddmparker> core = feature request
[13:05:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: making it full width is part of structure CSS and JS
[13:06:05] <uGoMobi> and I will add demo for tooltip labels
[13:06:28] <uGoMobi> so that won't go in the library
[13:07:10] <uGoMobi> the structure CSS will be used for both slider and range so it will land after range is ready
[13:07:28] <uGoMobi> then I will close the ticket
[13:08:19] <toddmparker> ok, cool
[13:09:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toddmparker: i know i know im holding everything up :)
[13:09:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: he he don't worry... you have done tons of work!
[13:09:40] <toddmparker> you're fired arschmitz 
[13:09:50] <toddmparker> i'm docking your pay anyway
[13:10:01] <toddmparker> we're in great shape
[13:10:15] <toddmparker> fell like you've helped us really move ahead
[13:10:20] <toddmparker> feel, not fell
[13:10:30] <uGoMobi> oh that's a fact
[13:10:38] <arschmitz> yeah and i got an awesome suprise for my own stuff had a new website due jan 1st dec 3rd we decided to open early is the website ready? but you only asked for the site on the nov 30th? 
[13:10:46] <arschmitz> what 6 days isnt enough????
[13:10:55] <gseguin> man the jQM crew is getting smaller by the minute
[13:11:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: damn i think that means i owe you money
[13:11:17] <uGoMobi> to be complete... I will also add a reference/test/demo (however we name it) for slider and range to the demo pages
[13:11:26] <gseguin> guys I think we should unionize to fight our tyrannic boss
[13:11:41] <uGoMobi> have that one on my own repo for testing where I worked on the full width thing
[13:13:08] <arschmitz> thats it im going on strike until you return me to my non paying job!
[13:13:27] <arschmitz> at my full previous wage of 0
[13:14:01] <uGoMobi> *cricket*
[13:16:29] <toddmparker> think i haven't broken unions in the past?
[13:16:36] <toddmparker> how do you think i got this gig?
[13:16:53] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:17:28] <toddmparker> alright arschmitz, you're hired back at a 70% increase. 
[13:17:30] <toddmparker> $0 x .7 = $0
[13:17:40] <arschmitz> SWEET! DEAL
[13:17:52] <toddmparker> *shakes hand*
[13:17:56] <arschmitz> it feels good to make $0 again
[13:18:08] <gseguin> toddmparker that's how you give 70% increase to your employees?!
[13:18:41] <gseguin> that's good they end up with a 30% cut, well done boss!
[13:19:01] <arschmitz> gseguin: no he just puts his headphones on and ignores Wiltos: constant crying 
[13:19:13] <gseguin> :)
[13:20:08] <uGoMobi> maybe we need a #jquerymobile-aftercare channel
[13:20:26] <toddmparker> gseguin is a muck raker
[13:20:38] <arschmitz> where we have group sessions to talk about how toddmparker has traumatised us
[13:20:52] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:20:55] <toddmparker> hey, i'm warm and fuzzy. 
[13:21:05] <uGoMobi> and say "it's not your fault" 1000 times
[13:21:06] <toddmparker> NOW GET BACK TO WORK!!*@#
[13:21:10] <arschmitz> like a procupine on fire
[13:21:24] <gseguin> :P
[13:21:43] * gseguin had to look for the definition of "muckraker"
