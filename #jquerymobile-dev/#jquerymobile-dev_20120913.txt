[07:17:43] <_|Nix|_> What's a good class to use to get the swatch background without getting its borders or its padding?
[07:34:43] <todd_> good morning…sorry i didn't check in, late night
[07:34:49] <todd_> working on finalizing the logo
[07:36:42] <todd_> _|Nix|_: the theme swatches for bars, buttons, content don't' set structural styles like padding or margin so those wouldn't apply.
[07:37:00] <todd_> swatches do spec things like bg color, gradient, border color, etc.
[07:37:58] <todd_> so you could use a swatch like ui-bar-b and in the structural css for the widget just negate the border like this .parent-widget .ui-bar-b { border:0; }
[07:38:18] <todd_> you have specific code i can look at?
[07:48:19] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Thanks! Meanwhile I realized that the padding was coming from the LI ...
[07:48:31] <_|Nix|_> todd_: I'm putting an element inside an LI ...
[08:08:05] <todd_> gotcha
[08:08:40] <todd_> general rule: swatches add color, structural styles per widget add dimensions, padding, etc.
[08:17:53] <uGoMobi> good morning / afternoon
[08:20:54] <uGoMobi> frequent: I am here if you like to discuss tabview
[08:22:19] <todd_> scott is going to update match media to the latest version
[08:22:38] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4979#issuecomment-8531367
[08:22:46] <todd_> i told him to go for it. should be faster.
[08:26:12] <frequent> @uGoMobi: yes we can :-)
[08:26:31] <uGoMobi> cool
[08:28:13] <frequent> @uGoMobi: regarding your comment on positioning and stretching the content section, it has been a while since I did this, but I recall it was pain...
[08:28:48] <uGoMobi> frequent: yes, I can imagine it's not easy
[08:29:09] <frequent> the hard part is to get by without setting a specific height on the collapsibleSet
[08:29:17] <uGoMobi> frequent: I was thinking about position absolute
[08:29:21] <frequent> in order to not disrupt the content flow if the set is in the page
[08:29:48] <frequent> I don't like the position:abs, but it's the only way I got it going
[08:30:00] <frequent> and once I had it... I didn't want to look back :-)
[08:30:06] <uGoMobi> haha
[08:30:12] <uGoMobi> I see
[08:30:18] <frequent> but I agree, this is not perfect
[08:32:13] <uGoMobi> frequent: you created a new repo for this, right?
[08:32:27] <frequent> yes
[08:32:45] <frequent> I have commented the both widgets, so you can see what I changed.
[08:32:57] <uGoMobi> yes I saw that, great!
[08:33:23] <uGoMobi> I will clone that repo
[08:33:32] <frequent> be my guest
[08:33:58] <uGoMobi> and then see if I can think of anything
[08:36:11] <frequent> I think the JS is pretty much ok. I'm trying with position:abs now, but if you set the content section to absolute (it might be easier to set margin/padding), but it will be removed from the content flow.
[08:36:22] <frequent> trying CSS
[08:41:44] <johnbender> todd_: yo
[08:42:00] <johnbender> todd_: would you like me to deploy?
[08:43:52] <frequent> @uGoMobi: just thinking, maybe it's possible to set the collapsible width to 100% (this way content would expand full screen) and then try to see if only the header can be "shrunk" to end up where it is now.
[08:43:52] <Wilto_> IRCCloud: you trippin’, dogg.
[08:45:13] <uGoMobi> frequent: yes, doing it the other way around might be a solution
[08:45:26] <uGoMobi> got your repo and demo local now
[08:46:34] <frequent> cool
[09:36:48] <todd_> johnbender: sorry, logo noodling
[09:36:54] <todd_> so yes, think we're close
[09:37:03] <johnbender> todd_: what are we waiting on?
[09:37:07] <todd_> I need to update the docs
[09:37:10] <todd_> think that's it
[09:37:15] <johnbender> coo
[09:37:26] <johnbender> todd_: do you want me to do the deploy so you have the links?
[09:37:29] <johnbender> I can redeploy later
[09:37:34] <todd_> scott j. is going to patch up our match media stuff, not sure if it'll make it
[09:37:42] <todd_> sure, that would help me test
[09:37:49] <_|Nix|_> What about that critical BB bug?
[09:38:04] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4978
[09:38:32] <_|Nix|_> I was checking my amazon.de and it's 205€ ...
[09:38:41] <_|Nix|_> Out of my league ...
[09:39:04] <_|Nix|_> The BB 9000, I mean ...
[09:45:42] <todd_> Jasoneail this morning and said they were looking at it
[09:45:48] <todd_> can't type, sorry
[09:46:31] <todd_> if bb can track it down for RC, cool, otherwise, it might need to be fixed after. perhaps before final.
[09:46:50] <todd_> seems like a bb5+ jQ core 1.8.1 thing
[09:49:41] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Yeah ... a regression caused by moving up to 1.8.1 ...
[09:55:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl created mobile-media-refactor (+1 new commit): http://git.io/z37Y_A
[09:55:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/mobile-media-refactor] updated our $.mobile.media function to use the matchMedia polyfill, which defers to the native function where possible. $.mobile.media still returns a boolean as it always has, but now, window.matchMedia is exposed in unsupporting environments too, which gives developers access to its standard API that returns an object, and in native implementations, supports listeners as well (a polyfill is avai
[09:59:31] <scottjehl> hey
[10:00:52] <scottjehl> Just dropped this in a branch for review. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/497b82a352c019b6461d24db2dc9b17bc4c514ed
[10:01:40] <scottjehl>  It just updates our internal matchMedia implementation to use the native one, where supported. It also exposes the native window.matchMedia in unsupporting environments, but otherwise, no changes to our $.mobile.media API
[10:02:12] <scottjehl> Might see a minor performance boost from this change
[10:03:48] <johnbender> scottjehl: do we currentlu support the window.matchMedia?
[10:04:59] <scottjehl> nah. what happened here is our original implementation was written before MM was a standard, and it formed the basis of the current matchMedia polyfill that now exists here: https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js/
[10:05:14] <johnbender> scottjehl: cool
[10:05:31] <scottjehl> That version was kept updated as MM became a standard, and the return value became an object rather than a bool
[10:05:39] <scottjehl> but ours never was
[10:06:04] <scottjehl> we can't break our return value (yet) right now, but internally, we can benefit from deferring to native MM where we can
[10:06:36] <scottjehl> I think this will take so ms off our start up time too
[10:06:44] <johnbender> cool
[10:06:59] <scottjehl> but yeah, as a result I went ahead and just exposed window.matchMedia if it's not there
[10:07:19] <scottjehl> that part is debatable, but I figured why not if it's included anyway
[10:07:41] <scottjehl> also, I pushed an update to the MM polyfill for style updates, so we can pull it in wholesale https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js/commit/35b041e731ab4a129c354c6042521b90f2fde5a3
[10:08:58] <scottjehl> anyway… not sure if you'd rather merge now or later
[10:33:50] <johnbender> todd_: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0-rc.1/
[10:43:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What about a tag?
[10:43:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't tag until we're ready
[10:44:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Aaaah, OK.
[10:44:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I just post it for todd to check his links against and then I do a final tag and redeploy
[10:44:43] <_|Nix|_> Understood.
[10:51:49] <todd_> i'll start an agenda
[10:56:30] <todd_> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZpho_PVuDWRwnvvWSPuDwtaLtfwNhljD2sn3NUiit4/edit
[10:56:39] <todd_> 4 minutes to fill it out…sorry!
[10:56:49] <todd_> johnbender: awesome
[11:03:33] <gseguin> is there a meeting today?
[11:16:45] <Wilto> Heard Bender was doing some science up in here.
[11:50:01] <Wilto> Wow, yeah, BB5 is hosed.
[11:52:32] <_|Nix|_> So is my Windoze machine after tried installing the simulator ... maybe it's just a coincidence ...
[11:52:58] <Wiltopedia> And we think it’s jQuery 1.8?
[11:53:32] <_|Nix|_> Wiltopedia: Seems fairly clear from what JasonDScott was saying - like, drop-in-to-break.
[11:53:53] <Wiltopedia> Gross.
[11:54:08] <_|Nix|_> Been there before with the height calculation breakage in popup.
[11:54:35] <Wiltopedia> This is gonna be a fun one to track down.
[11:55:12] <_|Nix|_> Wiltopedia: I'd've liked to unleash my php-based console.log on that sucker, but my Windoze machine caved.
[11:55:37] <_|Nix|_> Amateur OS, that ...
[11:56:48] <_|Nix|_> Anyhooo ... /me go home now ...
[11:58:01] <Wiltopedia> JasonDScott_: Ping, perhaps unsurprisingly.
[11:59:10] <JasonDScott_> Wiltopedia: Hey
[11:59:24] <Wiltopedia> You actively digging into this BB5 issue?
[12:00:24] <JasonDScott_> Yes, we are looking into at the moment.
[12:06:31] <Wiltopedia> Oh, sweet. Not that I was terrified by the prospect of doing it, or anything.
[12:06:48] <Wiltopedia> Let me know if you need anything, yeah? For what it’s worth, I’m definitely seeing it here.
[12:10:11] <JasonDScott_> Thanks. I will let you know
[12:13:11] <johnbender> JasonDScott_: I don't know if you saw it but uGoMobi made the smart suggestion of doing a bisect with core
[12:13:11] <johnbender> `grunt watch` in one terminal to make sure it get's built, and do the bisect in another while referencing the dist/jquery.js in your test page
[12:13:30] <Wiltopedia> friggin love grunt
[12:13:55] <johnbender> s/get's/gets/
[12:19:54] <JasonDScott_> johnbender: Thanks I will try that
[12:23:59] <rworth> is there a way to entirely disable animations? I have a switch right now $.support.cssTransitions = false
[12:24:14] <rworth> but it only seems to disable some types of transitions
[12:25:22] <uGoMobi> rworth: you mean you don't want page transitions?
[12:26:15] <rworth> correct
[12:26:38] <uGoMobi> that's a configurable default
[12:27:21] <uGoMobi> $(document).bind("mobileinit", function(){
[12:27:21] <rworth> I feel like I tried that a couple weeks ago, maybe I need to revisit it. Thanks
[12:27:22] <uGoMobi>   $.mobile.defaultPageTransition = "none";
[12:27:24] <uGoMobi> });
[12:27:35] <rworth> perfect, I'll give that a go. thanks uGoMobi
[12:27:56] <uGoMobi> you're welcome
[12:28:28] <uGoMobi> rworth: note that you have to add that script before you load jquery.mobile.js
[12:29:35] <todd_> rworth: dialogs have a similar global config so you might want to set that too
[12:30:03] <todd_> ok johnbender - i'll make this docs changes for RC
[12:30:41] <rworth> todd_ thanks, that may be what I (was/am) missing
[12:31:59] <uGoMobi> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4999 maybe you want to give this a look
[12:32:54] <uGoMobi> or maybe leave it to Wiltopedia since that seems to be a clever guy
[12:33:02] <todd_> anyone think of browser versions I need to update in the grid?
[12:33:19] <Wiltopedia> Yeah, that Wilto guy sucks.
[12:33:47] <uGoMobi> yup, useless
[12:34:21] <uGoMobi> did you guys had a chance to test on iOS6 already?
[12:34:30] <Wiltopedia> Yeah, I’m running it on my iPhone.
[12:34:33] <Wiltopedia> A-OK.
[12:34:40] <rworth> todd_ any chance http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9912834/default-dialog-transition-none-is-still-giving-me-pop-transition is relevant, caus this seems like the issue I hit recently
[12:35:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to testswarm: http://git.io/8St8PA
[12:35:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/testswarm] extend scroll test timeout to accomodate IE slow scrolling - John Bender
[12:36:07] <uGoMobi> todd_: I don't see Honeycomb 3.2 in the list
[12:36:55] <todd_> rworth: try this page - 2nd link
[12:36:56] <todd_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/config/index.html
[12:37:05] <todd_> changes it to flow, but
[12:37:30] <todd_> don't refresh or you'll lose the config. tacky way to test, I know
[12:37:42] <todd_> <script>
[12:37:42] <todd_> 		$(document).bind("mobileinit", function(){
[12:37:44] <todd_> 			$.mobile.defaultPageTransition = 'flow';
[12:37:45] <todd_> 		});
[12:37:45] <todd_> 	</script>
[12:38:14] <Wiltopedia> THIS issue again.
[12:38:20] <todd_> uGoMobi: 4th bullet
[12:38:20] <todd_> Android 3.1 (Honeycomb)  - Tested on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Motorola XOOM
[12:38:47] <todd_> 3rd, sorry
[12:38:50] <uGoMobi> todd_: but there is a 3.2 too right?
[12:39:05] <todd_> hmmm
[12:39:16] <todd_> I'd need to check what version we're testing on
[12:39:25] <Wiltopedia> I fixed this and we had to roll it back, and I can’t recall why…
[12:39:47] <uGoMobi> FF can be updated to 15
[12:39:49] <todd_> I see. I'll bump to 3.2
[12:40:21] <todd_> FF mobile or desktop?
[12:40:40] <uGoMobi> FF desktop
[12:40:59] <uGoMobi> but FF for Android is v15 too if I am not mistaken
[12:41:29] <todd_> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox
[12:41:30] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:41:33] <uGoMobi> it is
[12:41:35] <todd_> 15 on mobile too now
[12:41:46] <uGoMobi> yup just checked on my phone
[12:42:04] <uGoMobi> what about IE10?
[12:42:09] <todd_> <strong>Firefox Mobile 15</strong> - Tested on Android 2.3 and 4.1 device
[12:42:55] <uGoMobi> I didn't see any issues while browsing the docs on IE10
[12:43:10] <uGoMobi> only unit tests act bit strange
[12:44:10] <todd_> Opera Mini 7
[12:44:16] <todd_> yep, upgraded that too
[12:44:19] <todd_> opera 12
[12:45:16] <todd_> <strong>Apple iOS 3.2-6.0</strong> - Tested on the original iPad (4.3 / 5.0), iPad 2 (4.3), iPad 3 (5.1 / 6.0), original iPhone (3.1), iPhone 3 (3.2), 3GS (4.3), 4 (4.3 / 5.0), and 4S (5.1 / 6.0)
[12:45:21] <todd_> bumped to 6
[12:45:30] <todd_> Wilto is testing
[12:45:55] <uGoMobi> looking for Opera Mobile now
[12:49:20] <uGoMobi> Opera Mobile is still 12
[12:51:01] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I launched the BB simulator ... how do I launch a browser ... _
[12:51:12] <_|Nix|_> Bah! St00pid keyboard layout ...
[12:51:39] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:52:20] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! If I hit the rocker key, it takes me to a new SMS ... I wanna highlight the item to the right!
[12:52:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you might have to set up wifi connection first
[12:52:52] <todd_> fun times
[12:52:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It says "Simulated network" ... does that mean it has no connectivity?
[12:53:06] <uGoMobi> at least, that's what I had to do to make the browser load something
[12:54:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then I'll probably have to do the same ...
[12:55:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well they have multiple BB5 simulators
[12:55:45] <uGoMobi> so not sure if it is the same for all
[12:55:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Mine says "BlackBerry 9300 Simulator"
[12:56:01] <_|Nix|_> Too bad they don't have a Linux version ...
[12:56:08] <uGoMobi> mine BlackBerry 9550 Simulator
[12:56:13] <_|Nix|_> Have to put up with this POS Windoze ...
[12:56:15] <uGoMobi> yeah I know
[12:56:35] <_|Nix|_> ... and I don't mean point-of-sale ...
[12:56:43] <uGoMobi> and it always hangs when you try to close the simulator
[12:56:53] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:57:20] <_|Nix|_> D000d ... how do I set up some connectivity ... man ... this BB is a different world ...
[12:57:53] <_|Nix|_> WTF does a folder with an arrow pointing into it mean?
[12:58:03] <uGoMobi> there is a "connections manager" or something like that menu
[12:58:27] <todd_> welcome to BB
[12:58:36] <uGoMobi> then just click what makes sense and click next :)
[12:59:10] <todd_> nokia is even more confusing
[12:59:22] <Wiltopedia> This is why I stick with ham radio.
[13:00:10] <_|Nix|_> Yaaay ... I figured it out ...
[13:00:24] <uGoMobi> todd_: I still don't have a clear picture of the Firefox Mobile landscape but I couldn't find a 12 beta release
[13:00:51] <_|Nix|_> Yep ... she h0rx0rzzzz alright ...
[13:01:28] <uGoMobi> I think there is only Firefox for Android now
[13:02:50] <todd_> yeah, just changed it to say mobile 15
[13:02:57] <todd_> there is a version
[13:03:11] <todd_> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox
[13:03:14] <todd_> right column
[13:03:19] <todd_> CURRENT VERSION:
[13:03:20] <todd_> 15.0.1
[13:03:54] <_|Nix|_> OK ...weäre in business ...
[13:04:01] <_|Nix|_> St00pid kb layout ...
[13:04:32] <todd_> heh
[13:04:53] <uGoMobi> todd_ : yes I know that's the current version but I meant what is the first version we support
[13:05:30] <uGoMobi> todd_: but not really big deal
[13:08:43] <uGoMobi> todd_: going to pull https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4982
[13:09:11] <uGoMobi> that's MauriceG his PR for the popup header/content/footer corner styling
[13:10:12] <uGoMobi> any objections?
[13:20:27] <_|Nix|_> OK ... BB5 dies inside $.mobile.showPageLoadingMsg() ... it is called from initializePage in init ...
[13:20:43] <_|Nix|_> The hunt is on ...
[13:21:04] <_|Nix|_> "undefined is not a function" is the error ...
[13:24:44] <todd_> go for it uGoMobi
[13:24:56] <todd_> _|Nix|_: getting closer!
[13:25:12] <todd_> johnbender: should i update version.txt to RC or wait?

[13:27:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Updated supported browses and refs to RC1 - toddparker
[13:30:12] <uGoMobi> what I like to discuss some time about triage is that I suggest to close all incomplete issue submissions right away
[13:30:30] <uGoMobi> and reopen after missing info or test page is provided
[13:31:01] <uGoMobi> maybe giving it a label so we can still track and work on the issue
[13:32:02] <uGoMobi> but my opinion is that our issue tracker is often used as a forum
[13:32:58] <uGoMobi> where many people just post little info and then ask why doesn't it work
[13:33:10] <uGoMobi> or am I too aggresive? :)
[13:33:43] <todd_> uGoMobi: that might be a good idea
[13:33:52] <todd_> or reply and close within 48 hours
[13:33:58] <todd_> 1 months too long
[13:34:12] <todd_> i agree tho - i'd rather close a lotos questionable issues
[13:34:22] <todd_> so we can get a better handle
[13:34:47] <uGoMobi> so much clutter
[13:35:33] <uGoMobi> and often it has to do with custom code which becomes clear after we already spend a lot of time on it
[13:36:46] <johnbender> uGoMobi: we could automate the closing of bugs tagged with <waiting for sample> after a certain amount of time
[13:37:25] <uGoMobi> just thinking about a way to force people to create a bare test page first and see if the issue is still there
[13:37:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes good idea
[13:42:20] <_|Nix|_> The BB5 problem seems to be inside $.fn.offset() ...

[13:44:50] <todd_> _|Nix|_: nice
[13:46:32] <uGoMobi> todd_: yes, agreed
[13:58:03] <_|Nix|_> OK ... the problem is that jQuery calls getBoundingClientRect() on a div element, and it's causing an error of "undefined is not a function" ...
[13:58:22] <_|Nix|_> So, I guess div elements on BB5 do not have a "getBoundingClientRect" method.
[13:58:45] <_|Nix|_> Now, let's figure out who introduced this, and whether there's an alternative.
[13:58:47] <todd_> ah ha!
[13:58:59] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: ^
[13:59:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: impressive
[13:59:10] <todd_> timmywill would probably be best but let's see if DaveMethvin can give it a look
[13:59:18] <_|Nix|_> The power of alert() will not be denied.
[13:59:19] <todd_> nice sleuthing _|Nix|_
[13:59:24] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:59:30] <todd_> heh. true mobile debugging.
[13:59:30] <DaveMethvin> wat
[13:59:40] <todd_> you broke the internet
[13:59:41] <DaveMethvin> getBoundingClientRect not there???
[13:59:55] <todd_> is JasonDScott in da house?
[13:59:58] <DaveMethvin> imma pretty sure mikesherov asked about that one
[14:00:06] <DaveMethvin> we choppped out a lot of code with that
[14:00:11] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: jquery-1.8.1.js:9091 ...
[14:00:14] <JasonDScott> todd_: I am now
[14:00:22] <todd_> hey JasonDScott
[14:00:24] <DaveMethvin> is this like a recent BB or an old one?
[14:00:32] <todd_> _|Nix|_ narrowed this BB5 issue down
[14:00:35] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: No idea: BB5 ...
[14:00:52] <todd_> Do div elements on BB5 have a "getBoundingClientRect" method?
[14:01:09] <_|Nix|_> JasonDScott: js/jquery.js:9091 elem.getBoundingClientRect() gives an error of "undefined is not a function" ...
[14:01:28] <JasonDScott> I am not positive
[14:01:49] <DaveMethvin> no i was thinking of  webkitConvertPointFromNodeToPage
[14:02:06] <_|Nix|_> JasonDScott: Well, that's what happens on my "BlackBerry 9300 Simulator", anyway *shrug*
[14:02:56] * _|Nix|_ dives into the jQ repo ...
[14:03:05] <JasonDScott> I did a git bisect on core/sizzle and found the commit it break on is 6e524a5915a8a5dda1969898749c81d0fae64e6e of sizzle
[14:03:16] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: is this only broken on 1.8.1, or is it broekn on 1.8.0 as well?
[14:03:33] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Lemme check ...
[14:03:33] <DaveMethvin> oh thanks JasonDScott
[14:05:27] <DaveMethvin> most importantly _|Nix|_ does it work on http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js?
[14:05:30] <DaveMethvin> this may be a fixed bug
[14:06:09] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: I'll check that too ...
[14:09:37] <JasonDScott> DaveMethvin: It is also broken on 1.8.0
[14:09:43] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: It's broken at the same spot.
[14:09:44] <todd_> one step ahead of us DaveMethvin
[14:09:52] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: ... with jquery-git.js ...
[14:10:16] <DaveMethvin> okay, so it's fixed in -git?
[14:10:26] <DaveMethvin> what's your release timing look like?
[14:10:46] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: It is not fixed in git.
[14:10:56] <DaveMethvin> oh
[14:11:00] <DaveMethvin> well darn
[14:11:26] <DaveMethvin> JasonDScott's bisect seems to indicate sizzle is to blame but that seems odd
[14:11:27] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: It's line 9100 of 74cdd784975ba6e628d1934a859faeb017824a5f
[14:11:58] <_|Nix|_> *shrug* ...
[14:12:17] <_|Nix|_> I put an alert before that line and one after that line, and I only get the first one.
[14:13:17] <DaveMethvin> so _|Nix|_  how the heck did you narrow it down enough
[14:13:27] <todd_> alerts
[14:13:34] <DaveMethvin> that's some mighty persistent alerting there
[14:13:40] <todd_> how else do you fix bugs?
[14:13:43] <todd_> :)
[14:13:54] <DaveMethvin> if it's good enough for visual basic ... "D
[14:14:11] <_|Nix|_> Well, alert() + find | grep '\.js$' | xargs grep -nHE 'relevant keyword here'
[14:15:45] <DaveMethvin> i got a badd feeling about this
[14:17:40] <_|Nix|_> Well, we can gloss over it if we wrap init's $.mobile.showPageLoadingMsg(); into a try/catch block.
[14:17:57] <_|Nix|_> But that's just evil.
[14:18:22] <_|Nix|_> That is, we wrap the call inside js/jquery.mobile.init.js into a try/catch block.
[14:18:41] <_|Nix|_> I've gotten the page to show up by doing that.
[14:20:02] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: How do you update jquery's subprojects to the required commitid? I get a diff in both sizzle and qunit ...
[14:20:07] <_|Nix|_> I never figured that out.
[14:20:27] <_|Nix|_> I always cd into the subproject directory and git checkout whatever commitid is required to make the diff go away.
[14:20:31] <DaveMethvin> sizzle is a submodule of jquery
[14:20:34] <_|Nix|_> Is there some global way of doing that?
[14:20:37] <_|Nix|_> I know.
[14:20:42] <DaveMethvin> so the commit for jquery is the one you'd want
[14:20:53] <DaveMethvin> but anyway i am pretty sure i know what is happening
[14:20:55] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/796
[14:21:29] <DaveMethvin> So what's the market share on BB5?
[14:21:45] <DaveMethvin> i know mikesherov asked a the time
[14:22:39] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: In that commit, the call is wrapped in a try - since then, the try has been removed.
[14:23:03] <JasonDScott> DaveMethvin: Still significant especially in the global market
[14:23:05] <DaveMethvin> but is it okay to not have offset avail for bb5?
[14:23:16] <_|Nix|_> Egads!
[14:23:16] <DaveMethvin> what level support are you giving it?
[14:23:25] <_|Nix|_> Popups will not look very good without offset() :)
[14:24:24] <DaveMethvin> is bb5 A-grade?
[14:24:59] <DaveMethvin> we could wrap it in try/catch or just check for the api being there, that's not a problem
[14:25:04] <DaveMethvin> but offset won't work
[14:25:11] <JasonDScott> B-grade
[14:25:37] <_|Nix|_> So, there's no way to get the offset of an element on BB5?
[14:25:55] <DaveMethvin> webkitConvertPointFromNodeToPage
[14:26:07] <DaveMethvin> that's the code path that got removed
[14:26:21] <DaveMethvin> because afawk it wasn't needed
[14:26:28] <DaveMethvin> and we took it out 4 months ago
[14:26:34] <DaveMethvin> no complaints until today :)
[14:29:12] <JasonDScott> What was the first jquery core version it was removed from?
[14:29:28] <DaveMethvin> jQuery 1.8.0beta1 i think
[14:29:42] <DaveMethvin> then beta2, rc1, 1.8.0, 1.8.1
[14:29:48] <DaveMethvin> so there can't be THAT many people affected
[14:30:29] <DaveMethvin> is there an installed base market share number for it?
[14:30:31] <todd_> Yeah, BB5 is pretty popular. Golden times for BB so it may be a pretty healthy chunk
[14:30:31] <JasonDScott> The recommended version for JQM was 1.7.1
[14:31:00] <todd_> until fairly recently, yes
[14:31:35] <todd_> but i'm surprised you didn't get an BB5 issues directly
[14:31:45] <DaveMethvin> we don't  have any way to automated-test these envs so we depend on others to test during beta etc
[14:32:24] <DaveMethvin> so first lets's establish that BB5 needs .offset() ... does it to get jQM support at the right grade level?
[14:33:11] <DaveMethvin> we can just try/catch or return 0s for the offset value if it's the error alone causing hte problem
[14:33:33] <DaveMethvin> if it is needed, either jQM can shim .offset() or we can put it back
[14:33:59] <_|Nix|_> JasonDScott: Is there any way to collect the information returned from elem.getBoundingClientRect() on BB5?
[14:34:35] <JasonDScott> What do you mean by "collect"?
[14:35:06] <_|Nix|_> JasonDScott: Write a function whose output contains the same information as elem.getBoundingClientRect() ...
[14:35:21] <_|Nix|_> JasonDScott: ... using only properties available on elements in BB5.
[14:35:39] <DaveMethvin> i am thinking bb5 does not have getBoundingClientRect and was depending on webkitConvertPointFromNodeToPage
[14:35:45] <DaveMethvin> but i don't even  have any docs for bb5 browser
[14:36:27] <_|Nix|_> Probably ...
[14:38:23] <JasonDScott> _|Nix|_: Possibly… I would have to look into it
[14:39:06] <JasonDScott> BB5 is not a webkit browser I don't think it supports webkitConvertPointFromNodeToPage...
[14:39:28] <DaveMethvin> okay well that really opens up the mystery
[14:39:53] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Then it was probably the removal of the try from around that call that broke it.
[14:40:06] <DaveMethvin> in that case it's an easy fix!
[14:40:10] <DaveMethvin> well i can easily add a check for gBCR being there and return { top: 0, left: 0 }
[14:40:59] <_|Nix|_> The more interesting question is, was the offset() returning correct values despite the absence of that call?
[14:41:24] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/726
[14:41:26] <DaveMethvin> probably not
[14:41:34] <JasonDScott> Browser docs: http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/subcategories/?userType=21&category=BlackBerry+Browser&subCategory=&url=%2Fdevelopers%2Fsubcategories%2F&versionId=494
[14:42:21] <DaveMethvin> JasonDScott: i get to this page which is empty: http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/11849/Overview_alphabetical_790336_11.jsp
[14:42:43] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: 631f0933b061dc3d22ab3cd1974c5f6d02083f81 is the commit where the try is removed.
[14:44:00] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: yeah i think our reasoning was that we wouldn't encounter a browser without gBCR so we didn't need that
[14:44:57] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Consider this a close encounter of the fourth kind :)
[14:45:46] <DaveMethvin> well the big issue here seems to be that BB5 doesn't support anything but our lard-butt implementation, which was removed here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/726
[14:46:04] <DaveMethvin> that's a LOT of code
[14:46:49] <DaveMethvin> sooo ... i'd prefer not to have that back in core, but we can put together a duck-punch for .offset() if you need it for mobile maybe?
[14:47:16] <DaveMethvin> but i'm still not sure whether the BB5 support in Mobile needs .offset(), is B-grade only less ajax support?
[14:47:29] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[14:47:42] <_|Nix|_> B-Grade is the whole 8.9995 yards.
[14:47:52] <DaveMethvin> damn grade inflation
[14:47:57] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:48:43] <_|Nix|_> Well, I must go to bed now ... L8R all ...
[14:48:55] <DaveMethvin> adios and thanks _|Nix|_!
[14:49:04] <todd_> yeah, B is just non-ajax
[14:49:18] <todd_> honestly BB5 run terrible because they are so under-powered
[14:49:30] <todd_> thanks _|Nix|_
[14:49:53] <DaveMethvin> well we don't want them to throw errors from this in core, so i think we'll either put back the try/catch or more likely return 0,0
[14:49:54] <todd_> can we see how much we need this code?
[14:50:14] <todd_> I think not erring out is the main thing
[14:50:28] <DaveMethvin> yes, maybe you can drop back to C grade or something? dunno what the 0,0 will do do you
[14:50:30] <DaveMethvin> to
[14:50:40] <todd_> C grade = plain old HTML :)
[14:50:47] <DaveMethvin> we could put together a plugin or shim perhaps
[14:50:49] <todd_> which may be a better experience, but hey
[14:50:54] <DaveMethvin> it's just SOOOOO big
[14:50:57] <DaveMethvin> twss
[14:51:15] <todd_> that is a ton of code.
[14:51:21] <todd_> wow
[14:51:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah, combined with the webkit stuff we took out it's like 600 bytes compressed
[14:51:38] <todd_> sheesh
[14:51:57] <todd_> so i'm not sure how this is used exactly in the code
[14:52:07] <DaveMethvin> which reminds me, this also will fail on the original 2007 iphone because we took the webkit stuff out
[14:52:08] <todd_> so i dunno what we'd recommend you'd do
[14:52:16] <todd_> yeah?
[14:52:27] <todd_> but what iOS version?
[14:52:31] <todd_> most are running 3.2
[14:52:36] <todd_> even the original
[14:52:54] <DaveMethvin> oh i know 3.0 broke but maybe the point upgrad fixed it
[14:52:59] <DaveMethvin> it's definitely there in 4.0
[14:53:15] <todd_> so maybe just 3.2
[14:53:20] <DaveMethvin> okay, so for immediate steps imma have it not error out
[14:53:30] <DaveMethvin> but if you need better support than that we shoudl talk
[14:53:44] <DaveMethvin> maybe have a plugin or something
[14:54:35] <todd_> Wilto is going to see where we're suing this
[14:54:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Fw37dQ
[14:54:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Readme: minor changes to "how to submit an issue" instructions. - Jasper de Groot
[14:54:45] <Wiltopedia> HERE I COME TO SAVE THE DAY
[14:56:31] <Wiltopedia> This, right here, is a COMMIT. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/77536f5cb2ab042ac8be40ba59f36d8f3bd7e4d1
[14:57:36] <DaveMethvin> yep, that's the one Wiltopedia
[14:57:54] <Wiltopedia> Looks like we’re only using offset in slider (left offset), popup, and the… little loading spinner. Womp womp.
[14:58:10] <JasonDScott> Just got confirmation. there is no support for getBoundingClientRect in BB5
[14:58:13] <todd_> so maybe we can re-think on our side
[14:58:19] <DaveMethvin> would that code have hurt feelings if we returned {top:0, left: 0}?
[14:58:20] <todd_> thanks JasonDScott
[14:58:21] <Wiltopedia> Yeah. And old iOS.
[14:58:26] <Wiltopedia> it would
[14:58:43] <Wiltopedia> DaveMethvin: The slider is the only one that makes me nervous there.
[14:58:47] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: One more thing before I pass out: In jquery.js it's box = elem.getBoundingClientRect(); ... if you do put the try back in, make it try { box = elem.getBoundingClientRect(); } catch( e ) { box = { left: 0, top: 0 } }
[14:59:09] <Wiltopedia> I feel like we can work around this, though.
[14:59:25] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: ... because only the left and top properties of "box" are used in the rest of the function/
[14:59:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah _|Nix|_ that was my thinking too
[14:59:39] <DaveMethvin> just a little white lie
[15:00:00] <DaveMethvin> well cmon Wiltopedia there can't be more than 4 old hipsters using the original iPhone now at lest
[15:00:00] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Yeah, and that'll at least be in the ballpark, because it adds scrollLeft and scrollTop ...
[15:00:36] <_|Nix|_> OK ... now I'm really gone ...
[15:00:38] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[15:00:43] <Wiltopedia> DaveMethvin: I prefer to think of it as “iPhone Classic.”
[15:00:48] <uGoMobi> good night _|Nix|_
[15:00:55] <Wiltopedia> But yeah, in any case, we can get this sorted.
[15:02:01] <DaveMethvin> we have a bug triage meeting tonight in 1.5 hours, i'll let everyone know we've done a bang-up job on this one :D
[15:02:24] <Wiltopedia> ?cc
[15:02:25] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[15:03:37] <Wiltopedia> basically
[15:04:34] <johnbender> I've been working on IE issue for the last 3 hours :/
[15:04:47] <johnbender> scroowowwwwwwwllllllingnggnngnggnggggg
[15:04:49] <DaveMethvin> IE?
[15:04:57] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: nothing to do with core :)
[15:05:03] <DaveMethvin> oh good
[15:05:06] <Wiltopedia> I told you not to bother with DD_Roundies, johnbender.
[15:05:14] <DaveMethvin> haha
[15:05:18] <Wiltopedia> But noooo, you just had to have your rounded corners…
[15:05:25] <johnbender> just letting everyone know that I'm not doing nothing over here
[15:05:46] <DaveMethvin> is not doing nothing similar to doing something?
[15:06:23] <Wiltopedia> According to my paychecks it is WOKKA WOKKA whoop todd is my boss I forgot
[15:06:50] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: it's acceptable to use double negatives for emphasis imo
[15:06:56] <johnbender> it has semantic value
[15:07:01] <DaveMethvin> you don't not say!
[15:07:02] <johnbender> maybe I missed the quotes
[15:07:09] <johnbender> not "doing nothing"
[15:07:41] <todd_> Issues #5,000 just came in. I'll drink to that!
[15:08:08] <uGoMobi> cheers
[15:09:41] <JasonDScott> Salute
[15:10:40] <DaveMethvin> we're up to #12531 in core ... more depressing is that chrome autocompletes bugs.jquery.com as soon as I type "b"  ... why couldn't it be a porn site like normal people?
[15:13:36] <uGoMobi> Issue # 5000 has only been alive for 1 minute :(
[15:13:55] <todd_> Just confirmed that iOS 3 is hosed too. Updated the ticket with info
[15:14:12] <todd_> we've close 4,600+ issues. DAMN
[15:14:16] <todd_> closed
[15:26:39] <todd_> so DaveMethvin  - are you going to change this to return 0,0 instead of erroring out?
[15:26:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah todd_ that seems like the best solution for now
[15:27:01] <todd_> goes my question is whether we should drop support for browsers that core doesn't support anymore
[15:27:08] <todd_> better than kaboom
[15:27:22] <DaveMethvin> well we need some way to coordinate with you on that
[15:27:26] <todd_> i think we can work around these situations with some time
[15:27:30] <todd_> ya
[15:27:32] <DaveMethvin> soft fails on this are fine i'd think
[15:27:41] <DaveMethvin> like, as long as it doesn't throw errors
[15:27:47] <todd_> we have relatively newish browsers that don't support things that desktop might
[15:27:52] <todd_> right
[15:28:04] <DaveMethvin> iOS3 is not newish! :D
[15:28:10] <todd_> at least it's usable. slider might be wonky, loader might not be positioned quite right
[15:28:16] <DaveMethvin> not sure when BB5 came out
[15:28:28] <todd_> it's a whole 32 years old
[15:28:32] <todd_> 3
[15:28:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's a lot better than a blank screen fur sure
[15:28:33] <todd_> not 32
[15:28:46] <todd_> crazy that iPhone is only 5 years old
[15:28:55] <DaveMethvin> phone years are like dog years, so 21 years
[15:29:01] <todd_> right :)
[15:29:34] <DaveMethvin> okay, so offset gets 0,0 let me do that now so you can test
[15:30:48] <todd_> ok, cool
[15:30:55] <todd_> thanks DaveMethvin
[15:31:06] <todd_> heading out, but we'll pick this up in the morning
