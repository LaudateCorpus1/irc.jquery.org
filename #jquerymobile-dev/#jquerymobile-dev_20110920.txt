[07:05:36] <aaronmcadam> is datepicker safe to use?
[07:12:48] <aaronmcadam> anyone any idea?
[08:02:02] <toddparker> safe?
[08:02:15] <toddparker> it's a bit heavy and not supported anymore
[08:02:30] <toddparker> so it's a use at your risk kind of situation
[08:18:30] <toddparker> we need to decide what to do here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2066#issuecomment-2145951
[08:18:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2066 on jquery-mobile, reported by ryantofteland (2m, 1w ago): Select Menus won't open when pages are within FORM element
[08:38:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah toddparker I've just gone with an input placeholder, it's *very* heavy
[08:39:36] <aaronmcadam> esp on htc desire on 2.3
[08:40:04] <aaronmcadam> (android)
[08:44:54] <aaronmcadam> toddparker: I need to report this and make a fiddle, but when opening a collapsible within a dialog seems to close the dialog if you press 2 headings by accident
[08:46:12] <aaronmcadam> seems to close inconsistently
[08:46:40] <bobbobbins> hello
[08:47:33] <bobbobbins> im having an issue...i had a piece of code set up $('input[name="shipLap"]').prev('.ui-btn').click which worked fine in the old jquery mobile version, but it breaks now that I've upgraded, anyone know what im doing wrong?
[08:49:04] <aaronmcadam> how are you binding the code?
[08:49:18] <aaronmcadam> pagecreate, pageinit?
[08:55:22] <bobbobbins> umm, just $(document).ready(function(){
[08:57:59] <bobbobbins> im just trying to have a div pop up if the click the radio button
[08:58:05] <scottjehl> mornin
[08:58:35] <toddparker> @ aaronmcadam - please sod submit an issue for that
[08:58:41] <toddparker> do ^
[08:58:50] <aaronmcadam> yeah I know it sounds complicated
[08:59:05] <aaronmcadam> I'll submit it tomorrow with a fiddle
[08:59:15] <aaronmcadam> I'm hoping a fiddle extraction will point me to a fix
[08:59:40] <aaronmcadam> but I'm not doing any function calls or anything on click of the collapsible heading so yeah
[08:59:51] <toddparker> @ bobbobbins - that is a question for the #jquerymobile room. Read this docs page - esp. the big yellow block at the top. http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[09:00:08] <bobbobbins> oh oops...i didn't realize this was the dev room
[09:00:53] <toddparker> no problem bobbobbins!
[09:01:01] <bobbobbins> thanks for the help
[09:02:49] <gseguin> 'morning everyone
[09:03:22] <gseguin> toddparker: hi
[09:03:22] <toddparker> eddiemonge - you around?
[09:03:35] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[09:03:59] <gseguin> hey, just wanted to give you a heads up, it's crunch time at Jive for JiveWorld 11
[09:04:13] <toddparker> ah, whan's that
[09:04:17] <toddparker> when
[09:04:21] <gseguin> I might have to spend more time on Jive things this week and next
[09:04:47] <gseguin> Oct 4-6
[09:05:01] <gseguin> I know it's bad timing
[09:05:27] <gseguin> I'll keep at one day for jQM per week
[09:05:38] <gseguin> s/at/at least/
[09:11:20] <toddparker> ok, good to know
[09:11:37] <toddparker> i guess if you can finish up the collapsible stuff and push that, it would be good
[09:11:48] <toddparker> other issues on your plate that are bad enough o re-assign?
[09:12:25] <gseguin> I did a tiny bit of triage last night
[09:12:54] <gseguin> and assigned milestone to the one I will get fixed for RC
[09:24:37] <toddparker> thanks gs
[09:24:41] <toddparker> gseguin
[09:24:46] <toddparker> i've been chipping away too
[09:24:52] <toddparker> so many issues to go thru
[09:37:14] <_nickel> scottjehl: https://gist.github.com/55f99235d244694905a3
[09:37:29] <_nickel> scottjehl: yay! timeouts :(
[09:45:41] <toddparker> wut dat?
[09:46:17] <scottjehl> hmm k does it work?
[09:53:37] <_nickel> scottjehl: indeed it does
[09:53:42] <_nickel> does it make sense though?
[09:53:48] <_nickel> thats the real question
[09:53:59] <_nickel> and I think we should provide a way to turn it off for folks who don't care
[09:56:53] <_nickel> scottjehl: I should say it works for the desktop browsers I've tested and the mobile browsers I have access to
[09:57:45] <_nickel> scottjehl: also we have minScollBack, whats the reason for preventing scrolling of less than 250px?
[09:57:51] <_nickel> *scrollBack
[09:58:06] <_nickel> annoying little page shifts I guess?
[10:00:53] <_nickel> scottjehl: also I think the getLastScroll should be tweaked for a bit of speed up since its going to be fired more frequently
[10:07:10] <scottjehl> k
[10:07:22] <scottjehl> well if this fixes the bug, that says a lot
[10:09:45] <scottjehl> also, it's not an interval, which is good
[10:22:31] <toddparker> _nickel: the scroll back is just to set a threshold so it doesn't have the scroll jump if you just scrolled a small amount
[10:22:57] <_nickel> toddparker: thats what I figured
[10:23:40] <_nickel> scottjehl: I take you mean scrolltop doesn't use an interval. I don't quite undertstand how it works actually
[10:24:09] <_nickel> brb
[10:42:57] <_nickel> scottjehl: does scrollstop work by clearing the timer until the scrollbar has been still for 50ms or more?
[10:43:03] <_nickel> still trying to grok it
[10:43:32] <_nickel> and I'm going under the assumption that its just being triggered from the scrollstart setup definition
[10:46:36] <_nickel> scottjehl: also the gist I posted won't work for the overflow scroll support
[10:46:58] <_nickel> since the element on which we'd need to bind to scrollstop is different in that case
[12:11:30] <kinblas> scottjehl: toddparker: ping
[12:24:45] <_nickel> scottjehl: https://gist.github.com/fcae872c630c0e846a41
[12:25:59] <kinblas> mobilepageafterinit?
[12:31:34] <_nickel> kinblas: yap
[12:31:35] <_nickel> lol
[12:31:39] <_nickel> worst event name evar
[12:31:52] <_nickel> I needed to know when the page container had been defined so I could bind to pagechange
[12:31:59] <_nickel> I'll come up with something better
[12:34:54] <kinblas> _nickel: pagecontainer will become a formal thing post 1.0
[12:35:04] <kinblas> we'll need multiple pagecontainers for tablet based ui
[12:35:54] <kinblas> we should just trigger fake "pagecontainerbeforecreate" and "pagecontainercreate"
[12:36:01] <kinblas> in anticipation of the real deal
[12:36:46] <_nickel> kinblas: so just before that value is determined then?
[12:36:57] <_nickel> and post 1.0 the determination will become more complex
[12:37:19] <kinblas> the pagecontainer is the body
[12:37:23] <kinblas> so it's already there
[12:37:30] <kinblas> maybe when we place the viewport class on it
[12:37:33] <_nickel> $pages.first().parent().addClass( "ui-mobile-viewport" );
[12:37:36] <kinblas> we immediately fire those things
[12:37:39] <_nickel> thats the pageContainer technically
[12:38:03] <kinblas> _nickel: yeah its body unless your .net form
[12:38:10] <kinblas> but you get my drift
[12:38:43] <_nickel> indeedly doodly
[12:45:41] <_nickel> well it looks like this is working quite nicely
[12:45:49] <_nickel> now I need to get that test to cooperate :(
[12:47:34] <_nickel> and test on an ios5 simulator tomorrow to make sure it works with the overflow scroll
[13:23:16] <_nickel> YAH BUDDY!
[13:23:22] <_nickel> that scrolling test is passing now too
[13:55:02] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddparker: gseguin: let me know if you guys have questions the scrolling bit, I'll try to land that tomorrow if the ios testing goes well
[14:02:43] <_nickel> moving on to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/793
[14:02:44] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #793 on jquery-mobile, reported by jaybuys (8m, 1w ago): orientationchange event returns wrong values on Android
[14:11:14] <kinblas> _nickel: yeah sometimes the resize happens before or after the orientation change
[14:11:30] <kinblas> _nickel: and sometimes the device doesn't dispatch a resize
[14:11:37] <kinblas> _nickel: good luck
[14:11:39] <kinblas> :-P
[14:21:33] <scottjehl> hey sorry
[14:21:49] <toddparker> hey _nickel  - do you need help testing that scrolling stuff?
[14:22:34] <scottjehl> woops https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/version.txt
[14:22:47] <scottjehl> should I change to rc1pre?
[14:22:56] <scottjehl> 1.0rc1pre
[14:23:24] <toddparker> ya
[14:24:31] <scottjehl> done
[14:27:11] <scottjehl> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/41d46403441af2e36e534c7a47f05db5cff56897
[14:27:11] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by scottjehl (35.541s ago): moved the support test for event capture, allowing vmouse to run standalone on jQuery Core.
[14:27:16] <scottjehl> kinblas
[14:27:22] <scottjehl> ^
[14:31:05] <kinblas> scottjehl: werd
[14:31:20] <kinblas> scottjehl: thanks!
[14:34:18] <scottjehl> yeah for sure
[14:34:31] <scottjehl> so I'm running jslim on jQuery Mobile
[14:43:22] <scottjehl> just updated jquery in our repo
[14:43:29] <scottjehl> 1.6.2 was running
[14:43:31] <scottjehl> eek
[14:48:55] <toddparker> oh hey kin - did i say to go ahead and kill the mouse events on lists/buttons (mouse only)?
[14:49:03] <toddparker> can't keep stuff straight
[14:49:19] <toddparker> this is to fix the row hover triggering on scroll kinblas
[14:49:32] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, it wasn't kill it
[14:49:44] <kinblas> it was kill vmouseover vmouseout, and use mouseover mouseout
[14:50:00] <kinblas> toddparker: I'll do that next
[14:50:19] <kinblas> toddparker: and then you can play with it and see if you like?
[14:50:27] <toddparker> oops, missed the "v" there
[14:50:31] <toddparker> yeah
[14:50:31] <kinblas> the one problem is you won't get feedback when you touch things
[14:50:36] <kinblas> unless you lift your finger
[14:50:45] <kinblas> FYI, we are killing the class on vcancel
[14:50:55] <toddparker> but you'll still get the tap > active state?
[14:50:57] <kinblas> but the screen is locked until you lift your finger
[14:51:11] <toddparker> i see
[14:51:21] <kinblas> toddparker: personally, I like the instant feedback
[14:51:23] <toddparker> let's prototype it and do some testing
[14:51:26] <kinblas> but it's up to you guys
[14:51:30] <toddparker> for me the sticky hover stuff is really odd
[14:51:34] <kinblas> prototype as in branch?
[14:51:38] <toddparker> so it might be a good tradeoff
[14:51:43] <kinblas> or land it and we'll see how it goes?
[14:51:57] <toddparker> landing is probably fine actually
[14:52:03] <toddparker> it's a minor change
[14:52:14] <toddparker> i don't see myself not wanting to mitigate this
[14:52:17] <kinblas> yeah easy to switch back but we need an answer before we ship
[14:52:22] <toddparker> k
[14:52:34] <toddparker> so just gimme a shout when you push it and i'll test away
[14:53:30] <toddparker> maybe we could flip to active after X ms = extended mouseover on touch?
[14:53:49] <toddparker> anyway, that is minor. if you tap, it will work as expected
[14:58:18] <_nickel> toddparker: I do, but I haven't pushed it yet
[14:58:28] <_nickel> toddparker: I'm warry of pushing things public on so little testing
[14:58:36] <_nickel> but I cerainly can if you're feeling "testy"
[15:02:36] <kinblas> toddparker: I just confirmed on iOS that even if we remove the hover class on vmousecancel, the screen does not update until we lift our finger.
[15:02:47] <kinblas> consoloe logging confirms that the class is being removed
[15:02:53] <kinblas> that sucks
[15:02:58] <kinblas> I like the feedback
[15:09:01] <kinblas> scottjehl: toddparker: you guys have an ASUS Eee Pad by chance?
[15:09:17] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2477
[15:09:18] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2477 on jquery-mobile, reported by marko86 (1d, 3h ago): vmouseup not working properly in Android browser!
[15:10:24] <toddparker> we have a better asus
[15:10:39] <toddparker> oh, not a eee PAD
[15:10:41] <toddparker> what crap
[15:10:53] <toddparker> NOT SUPPORTED :)
[15:11:39] <toddparker> kinblas: so that means we need to cancel sooner, on vmousedown?
[15:11:52] <toddparker> which kills the tap feedback
[15:12:13] <kinblas> toddparker: you can't cancel on down, because you don't know if they are going to scroll yet
[15:12:24] <toddparker> ooooh
[15:12:26] <kinblas> toddparker: I did verify that we are getting a vmousecancel for the scroll
[15:12:31] <toddparker> so we can't cancel
[15:12:31] <kinblas> we are removing the classes
[15:12:37] <kinblas> but the screen just isn't updating
[15:12:44] <toddparker> bah
[15:12:50] <kinblas> btw, what I was suggesting won't work
[15:12:58] <kinblas> it's not the hover that is being seen
[15:13:02] <kinblas> it's the btn-dwn
[15:13:06] <toddparker> so is there a way to now add the class in the first place
[15:13:18] <kinblas> to not add the class?
[15:13:18] <toddparker> not btn-hover?
[15:13:36] <kinblas> I thought it was the btn-hover we were seeing
[15:13:38] <kinblas> but it's not
[15:13:42] <kinblas> it's the btn-down
[15:13:46] <kinblas> color
[15:13:53] <kinblas> I just verified on desktop
[15:13:53] <toddparker> comfirmed
[15:13:56] <kinblas> hover is ugly
[15:13:58] <kinblas> gray
[15:14:09] <toddparker> i can see the gradient flip to the depressed style = down
[15:14:11] <toddparker> heh
[15:14:13] <kinblas> right
[15:14:22] <kinblas> btw no offense meant by the ugly
[15:14:27] <kinblas> it's not as pretty as down
[15:14:29] <kinblas> :-P
[15:14:43] <toddparker> so mean!
[15:15:02] <kinblas> so what to do?
[15:15:05] <toddparker> so do we have options?
[15:15:42] <kinblas> toddparker: I don't think so .. the options are, give feedback on all buttonMarkup components when finger goes down
[15:15:47] <kinblas> or nothing at all
[15:15:54] <kinblas> just to satisfy this scroll case
[15:16:33] <toddparker> bah
[15:16:42] <toddparker> i'm going back to potato farming
[15:16:50] <kinblas> lol
[15:16:58] <toddparker> guess you can just comment on the issue and close
[15:43:23] <kinblas> toddparker: done
[15:54:44] <_nickel> anyone have any thoughts on when orientationchange should actually fire in the browser
[15:54:51] <_nickel> the problem is that someone is wrong
[15:55:04] <_nickel> either its supposed to fire before the change has taken place or aftre
[15:55:26] <_nickel> it looks like android is prone to firing before the change has taken place
[16:00:56] <kinblas> _nickel: orientationchange isn't a standard event so folks have differing implementations
[16:01:14] <kinblas> _nickel: w3 is working on an event called deviceorientation
[16:01:34] <kinblas> http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html#deviceorientation
[16:34:35] <_nickel> kinblas: thats what I saw from my short bit of googling
[16:34:40] <_nickel> that is, there isn't anything :(
[16:34:55] <_nickel> kinblas: is that device orientation with respect to the poles?
[16:34:57] * _nickel is reading
[16:35:13] <_nickel> seems odd that it would be under the geo
[16:35:56] <kinblas> _nickel: the only other standard reference to orientationchanged was in the now obsolete widget spec
[16:37:24] <_nickel> kinblas: the event name is joyously ambiguous too
[16:37:27] * _nickel sighs
[16:37:29] <kinblas> _nickel: fyi, I'm ripping out all references to beforechangepage and changepage
[16:37:39] <kinblas> in js and tests
[16:37:39] <_nickel> ahh
[16:37:48] <kinblas> we overlap in one area
[16:37:51] <_nickel> moving to pagebeforechange and pagechange eh?
[16:38:01] <kinblas> no
[16:38:05] <_nickel> ?
[16:38:11] <kinblas> beforepagechange becomes pagebeforechange
[16:38:17] <kinblas> changepage becomes pagechange
[16:38:29] <_nickel> did I type i wrong?
[16:38:38] <kinblas> oh heh
[16:38:47] <_nickel> *it
[16:38:47] <kinblas> I thought you meant you were mapping from pagebefore to pagechange
[16:38:50] <kinblas> nevermind
[16:38:51] <kinblas> :-)
[16:38:56] <_nickel> cool
[16:39:02] * kinblas has been deprecation happy this afternoon
[16:39:06] <_nickel> yay!
