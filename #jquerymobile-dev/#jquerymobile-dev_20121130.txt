[04:52:27] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi: _|Nix|_:
[04:54:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: when you have a second i noticed a few problems with popups in the docs
[05:05:38] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:21:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have a second :)
[05:21:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[05:21:32] <arschmitz> all the popups with transitions navigate back in history when you close them
[05:21:40] <arschmitz> and the dissmissible option is not work
[05:21:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Egads!
[05:22:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What platform/browser?
[05:22:05] <arschmitz> chrome
[05:22:08] <arschmitz> windows
[05:22:18] <_|Nix|_> Uh-oh ...
[05:22:36] <arschmitz> good morning :)
[05:23:03] <_|Nix|_> Must've been a recent mod ... weird that the sequence tests did not pick that up.
[05:23:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good eye!
[05:23:38] <arschmitz> yeah dosent happen with 1.2 so its something new
[05:24:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Unfortunately, I'm sitting in my car, so it might take me a while to set up my laptop. Lessee if I can repro on N900 :)
[05:25:00] <arschmitz> ah yeah thats not very convienent lol 
[05:26:33] <_|Nix|_> Gah! No transitions on built-in browser ... maybe opera ...
[05:35:20] <_|Nix|_> OK ... tethered up ...
[05:35:55] <_|Nix|_> Hut diggety! Reproduced.
[05:37:14] <_|Nix|_> Found the guilty commit.
[05:37:50] <arschmitz> i sentance it to life in the recycle bin!
[05:38:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not so fast. I call a stay on that. That commit has some benefits too. I'll trace the event sequence that's going awry before I carry out that sentence.
[05:39:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: softie
[05:39:45] <_|Nix|_> :)
[05:41:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The undismissible is not working because I forgot to fix the speling in the docs.
[05:41:56] <arschmitz> ha ha :)

[05:43:21] <_|Nix|_> Now, as for the toughter problem ...
[05:45:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thought i was going nuts last night working on something for a client but then it happened in the docs 
[05:49:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Never use master for production work :)
[05:50:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ its not
[05:50:52] <arschmitz> its way pre-production wont be done till well after 1.3 so was on master because can notice problems that way and wanted some of the 1.3 features
[05:52:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ apparently my plan worked i found 2 issues!
[05:53:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good that you noticed. I also found another problem. When you click on a link from inside a popup, and come back from the page opened by the link, the transition back is weird ...
[05:54:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Open the menu popup go to methods, and go back.
[05:54:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's like Bam!Baaaaaaaam!
[05:54:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Instead of the smooth Baaaaam! transition.
[05:54:31] <arschmitz> oh yeah
[05:54:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wonder where that happened.
[05:55:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not sure... popups are going rogue!
[05:55:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Gotta go now. I'll definitely check it out though. L8R!
[05:56:02] <arschmitz> HAve a good one
[06:03:28] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[06:19:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what are your thoughts on the optional clear button for the search input...
[06:20:00] <uGoMobi> the problem is the different default
[06:20:17] <uGoMobi> while both text input and search input use same option
[06:20:25] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:20:47] <arschmitz> im not even convinced search should have an option
[06:21:09] <arschmitz> its not an option if you just do type="search" on a normal page
[06:21:21] <uGoMobi> i didn't see the need either, although I understand toddmparker__ his point "consistency"
[06:21:45] <arschmitz> you could also say its inconsistant though because its not a text its a search
[06:21:51] <arschmitz> and search have a clear button
[06:22:23] <uGoMobi> yeah eventhough it's same widget I see it as a different feature
[06:22:36] <arschmitz> yup
[06:22:56] <uGoMobi> the left search icon isn't available to text inputs either
[06:23:03] <arschmitz> yup
[06:23:52] <uGoMobi> different border-radii too
[06:24:23] <uGoMobi> I will ask toddmparker__ when he is here
[06:24:36] <arschmitz> yeah my personal oppinion is we should not countervene standards 
[06:25:15] <uGoMobi> in what way is it a standard?
[06:25:39] <arschmitz> pretty sure the w3c spec for search says it should have a clear button dosent it?
[06:25:55] <uGoMobi> I dunno actually
[06:26:05] <uGoMobi> don't think so
[06:26:46] <arschmitz> im checking
[06:28:37] <arschmitz> nope actually it just says it should be styled in the same way as the OS the browser is on styles a search field
[06:28:54] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:28:59] <arschmitz> so i guess its ok for it to be an option
[06:30:24] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:35:29] <arschmitz> i thought it was part of the spec which is why i thought it shouldnt be an option
[06:35:44] <uGoMobi> if we want to use same option for both text and search input I would have to set the default to null
[06:36:17] <uGoMobi> and hardcode a fallback to false for text and true for search
[06:37:21] <uGoMobi> but I don't really like to hardcode defaults like that, because it is not the correct way for the widget factory
[06:37:48] <arschmitz> i still dont think it would be a problem to make it not optional for search
[06:38:06] <arschmitz> every browser i know that supports search has a non removeable clear button
[06:38:56] <arschmitz> i take that back
[06:38:59] <arschmitz> ios dosent
[06:39:42] <arschmitz> ok im completely wrong
[06:40:11] <uGoMobi> haha
[06:40:12] <arschmitz> ugh this is a pain
[06:40:22] <uGoMobi> desktop browsers maybe
[06:40:32] <arschmitz> nope firefox dosent
[06:40:37] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[06:40:43] <uGoMobi> so it's only chrome :)
[06:40:45] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:40:51] <arschmitz> yeah lol
[06:41:05] <uGoMobi> well I like Chrome :)
[06:41:11] <arschmitz> i hate to hardcode an option like that though
[06:41:13] <arschmitz> me too 
[06:41:17] <arschmitz> its all i use on desktop
[06:42:42] <uGoMobi> ok I'll wait with this until we discussed with toddmparker__ again
[06:42:53] <arschmitz> yeah its hard
[06:43:12] <uGoMobi> we never had any complains about the clear button
[06:43:13] <arschmitz> im swaying towards option now but still dont like how we would do it
[06:43:19] <arschmitz> true
[06:44:06] <arschmitz> i guess its a desktop webkit thing safari has the clear button
[06:44:16] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:44:24] <uGoMobi> maybe Opera too
[06:44:36] <arschmitz> yeah havent tried opera
[06:44:46] <uGoMobi> those are the browsers that add native controls to inputs
[06:45:05] <uGoMobi> i mean the date and number inputs
[06:45:17] <arschmitz> yup
[06:46:13] <arschmitz> i think i still vote not optional
[06:46:26] <arschmitz> if you dont want it use text lol
[06:46:57] <uGoMobi> I am leaning towards non optional too
[06:47:25] <arschmitz> search is a special type of text
[06:47:37] <arschmitz> if you want something different use text and customize it 
[07:42:45] <toddmparker> good morning

[08:56:01] <toddmparker> ^^ Let me know what else you think I should cover there
[09:07:59] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: sure, I will read the page this weekend
[09:07:59] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: did you see the discussion arschmitz and I had about search input clear button option?
[09:12:59] <johnbender> toddmparker: I owe you a paragraph on nav don't I?
[09:16:54] <toddmparker> johnbender: you do :)
[09:17:02] <johnbender> toddmparker: kk, I'll get right on it
[09:17:05] <toddmparker> even if you just add it as a comment to that nag ticket
[09:17:09] <toddmparker> nav
[09:17:23] <johnbender> toddmparker: ah, ok
[09:17:27] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: you're working on tizen for intel, right?
[09:17:27] <johnbender> toddmparker: the refactor ticket
[09:17:29] <johnbender> I'll do that
[09:17:38] <toddmparker> ok, that way it won't get lost
[09:18:25] <johnbender> toddmparker: good idea
[09:22:40] <johnbender> toddmparker: The comment that I posted as an update in there is actually a really good summary of what's been done
[09:22:43] <johnbender> it still stands
[09:22:49] <johnbender> and it's got code samples
[09:23:01] <johnbender> toddmparker: do you want me to trim tha down to something digestable in a blog post?
[09:23:10] <johnbender> without giving away too much of the internals?
[09:23:16] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and arschmitz - just finished catching up. always busy in here.
[09:23:25] <johnbender> ie, we're not sure yet if we want it to be a public api yet
[09:23:46] <toddmparker> johnbender: if there is a shorter summary that would be better for the berg post, sure
[09:23:54] <johnbender> kk
[09:23:57] <johnbender> I'll condense
[09:24:31] <toddmparker> maybe leave the full story
[09:24:38] <johnbender> yah it's in there
[09:24:44] <johnbender> just adding a new comment with a condensed version
[09:24:46] <toddmparker> and add a new blurb for the tl;dr
[09:24:52] <toddmparker> k
[09:25:10] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and arschmitz - want to talk about the search clear thing?
[09:25:21] <arschmitz> sure
[09:25:55] <arschmitz> if uGoMobi: is still around
[09:27:55] <uGoMobi> i am here
[09:28:51] <toddmparker> hey guys
[09:29:01] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: in short... if we want to make clr btn optional for search as well....
[09:29:11] <toddmparker> so sounds like the way you'd need to deal with the default option is't ideal?
[09:29:24] <toddmparker> sorry, go...
[09:29:26] <uGoMobi> we would have to add separate option for that
[09:29:38] <toddmparker> hrm
[09:29:45] <uGoMobi> yes, because of the different defaults
[09:29:46] <toddmparker> that doesn't seem worth it
[09:30:10] <uGoMobi> otherwise we have to have to hardcode the defaults
[09:30:16] <toddmparker> my thinking is as soon as we get this feature in, we'll get the issue "clear="false" broken on search"
[09:30:45] <uGoMobi> yes i understand your point of consistency
[09:30:56] <toddmparker> but if there isn't a way to have a different default based on the type, then let's just bag it
[09:31:03] <toddmparker> i agree it's not a common use case
[09:31:09] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:31:11] <arschmitz> there is a way
[09:31:15] <arschmitz> its just ugly
[09:31:16] <toddmparker> we might want to mention this in the docs
[09:31:21] <uGoMobi> yeah hardcode it
[09:31:29] <toddmparker> on search the default is "true" and it can't be false
[09:31:39] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yes document for sure
[09:31:40] <uGoMobi> i already mentioned it at the ticket
[09:31:48] <toddmparker> fine with me :)
[09:31:53] <uGoMobi> will also make this clear when adding option to the docs
[09:32:03] <toddmparker> see, i'm not *entirely* unreasonable
[09:32:09] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:32:13] <toddmparker> well, sometimes
[09:32:26] <arschmitz> :)
[09:32:35] <toddmparker> 1.3 is going to be a hot release. lots of cool features
[09:32:52] <toddmparker> that will keep everyone happy while we burn this mother down in 1.4
[09:32:53] <arschmitz> right before 1.4 which will just be a whole new library lol
[09:32:59] <toddmparker> yep
[09:33:34] <arschmitz> yeah lots of features for 1.3 though panels rwd tables range more popup stuff
[09:33:54] <uGoMobi> talking about range
[09:34:00] <toddmparker> yeah, useful stuff we'd use on most projects
[09:34:04] <uGoMobi> I am not completely sure about the name
[09:34:16] <arschmitz> its not going to be range i just havent changed
[09:34:17] <toddmparker> we just need to streamline all the code 
[09:34:19] <uGoMobi> kinda confusing with slider type="range"
[09:34:27] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[09:34:29] <arschmitz> i think we decided rangeslider or something
[09:34:38] <toddmparker> yeah
[09:34:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker do you remember you cameup with it
[09:37:53] <arschmitz> toddmparker: did you catch my conversation with _|Nix|_ earlier? ie popup is broken?
[09:39:39] <toddmparker> arschmitz: i saw that, sounds like he's looking at it?
[09:39:55] <toddmparker> and yes, that name was my genius idea
[09:40:14] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah he already tracked down the cause i think he just hasent had time to work on it. 
[09:40:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker: just figured you should know thats its known and being taken care of 
[09:42:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I just deleted a console.log from range JS... did you still need it?
[09:42:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its just there because im still working on it so i havent cleaned it up yet
[09:43:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but no i dont need it
[09:43:12] <uGoMobi> ok then we are good :)
[09:43:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its really no where near ready yet i had just pushed the branch becuase you wanted to check it out for the css
[09:44:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: still missing a bunch of methods and i know at least a few bugs i need to figue out and fix
[09:45:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ironicly i havent added _destroy yet :)
[09:47:35] <toddmparker> hey now
[09:47:42] <uGoMobi> haha
[09:47:55] <uGoMobi> it's ok arschmitz
[09:47:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but thanks for fixing all the spaces and standards stuff because it wasent finished i had been lazy and just hadnet fixed it all yet
[09:48:16] <uGoMobi> np
[09:50:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey, all! I'm on that fix now.
[09:50:21] <_|Nix|_> all: ^
[09:50:22] <_|Nix|_> :)
[09:50:54] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[09:51:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i know you have done a lot of work with the form element css so if you see anything on this please let me know i know its not perfect yet
[09:51:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ welcome back
[09:52:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will take care of that so you can focus on the JS
[09:52:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: works for me 
[09:52:40] <agcolom> evening all :-) (quick question (I'm at my daughter's guitar lesson)
[09:53:04] <uGoMobi> I don't know anything about playing guiter agcolom 
[09:53:06] <arschmitz> evening agcolom
[09:53:13] <uGoMobi> but you can ask
[09:53:15] <uGoMobi> :D
[09:53:36] <arschmitz> the answer is to turn it up to 11!
[09:53:37] <agcolom> you are so fast! question coming up...
[09:54:14] <agcolom> when using Themeroller, people can choose to remove swatch B and C, etc.... 
[09:55:03] <agcolom> now, we have default that use those theme swatches, but they also get removed from the css when people download a themeroller theme
[09:55:26] <uGoMobi> yes
[09:55:48] <uGoMobi> we recommend to use 3 swatches
[09:55:55] <agcolom> so if you then do not use theme swatch a in the content, or page, the content doesn't get enhanced!
[09:56:05] <uGoMobi> but if you only have one you have to configure the defaults
[09:56:08] <agcolom> right, that was my question
[09:56:16] <agcolom> perfect. 
[09:56:26] <uGoMobi> same goes for error message that uses swatch E by default
[09:56:42] <agcolom> I was going to create a tutorial on using themeroller, so I wanted to check those things with you.
[09:57:01] <uGoMobi> sure np
[09:57:17] <agcolom> the other solution is to keep the original css and add the custom themeroller theme afterwards, so there's not risk then, but there is duplication...
[09:57:20] <uGoMobi> I added the defaults to the docs some time ago
[09:57:44] <uGoMobi> yeah that's not the way to go
[09:58:23] <uGoMobi> because then they get enhanced but the color might still not be what you want
[09:58:39] <agcolom> ok, so you say the default theme swatch details are somewhere in the docs?
[09:59:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/themes.html
[09:59:14] <agcolom> really, people need a->c and e? (is there anything that defaults to d?)
[09:59:26] <uGoMobi> section default theme swatches
[09:59:35] <uGoMobi> but might be nice to put in a scheme
[09:59:44] <uGoMobi> instead of written in sentences
[10:00:09] <toddmparker> this is another area we might need to re-think
[10:00:36] <toddmparker> maybe our default theme should just have A and default to that
[10:00:43] <agcolom> could we have the default JQM themes in themeroller? 
[10:00:48] <toddmparker> we were very clever on theming. too clever.
[10:01:18] <agcolom> so if someone creates a custom theme A and B, they also get the JQM C and E>
[10:01:19] <agcolom> ?
[10:01:28] <toddmparker> problem is the theme swatch defaults are sort of base don our defaults
[10:01:39] <agcolom> yes
[10:01:47] <toddmparker> In TR, we default to a,b,c
[10:01:56] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: and then change the default theme so that swatch A toolbars is dark and swatch A body is light for example?
[10:02:02] <toddmparker> but you could only have a or z for that matter
[10:02:10] <agcolom> maybe a STRONG warning if people only create less than A B C and E?
[10:02:28] <toddmparker> the scripts just apply the classes blindly so if the swatch class isn't there, it's transparent or falls back 
[10:02:43] <toddmparker> or we re-vamp those defaults
[10:02:54] <agcolom> yes, I just tried that now and even the text is ugly! 
[10:02:55] <toddmparker> the e thing is especially odd
[10:03:07] <toddmparker> even if it does make sense with the defaults
[10:03:13] <toddmparker> default theme
[10:03:45] <toddmparker> i'd document how it works now, but we need to re-think this for 1.4
[10:03:45] <agcolom> (when there is no theme swatch corresponding to the content!
[10:03:56] <agcolom> ok, sounds like a good plan.
[10:04:11] <toddmparker> we need to find a way to have our basic structural styles work better w/o a theme
[10:04:22] <agcolom> Because also if people only need e for the error message, there is no need to define everything in e
[10:04:31] <toddmparker> right
[10:05:00] <uGoMobi> yes, work more with inherit and only apply specific theme styles if people set them
[10:05:18] <agcolom> I think we should also add a target to the link to jquerymobile.com from http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/ so that it opens in another window.
[10:05:22] <uGoMobi> so everything is enhanced
[10:05:45] <arschmitz> Thats a whole big can of worms to look at
[10:05:54] <agcolom> currently, if you click the link wondering what it does, (and you have spent ages defining your themes), you lose all your work!
[10:05:55] <arschmitz> theme inheritance
[10:05:59] <uGoMobi> i like can or worms
[10:06:12] <uGoMobi> :)
[10:06:22] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah thats probably a regional expression
[10:07:04] <agcolom> because there's a little right arrow, so I clicked just to see what was happening... and all my theme work was gone when I pressed the back button
[10:07:34] <arschmitz> theme inheritance will be important for 1.4 also though because we will want to make the widgets all work with it while we are re writing them 
[10:10:48] <agcolom> toddmparker: would that be ok with you? (I think we should also add a target to the link to jquerymobile.com from http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/ so that it opens in another window. currently, if you click the link wondering what it does, (and you have spent ages defining your themes), you lose all your work!)
[10:11:53] <uGoMobi> dinner time... be back later
[10:12:58] <agcolom> lesson is finished... catch you later...

[10:37:04] <johnbender> toddmparker: that might be kind of hard to understand without examples
[10:37:09] <johnbender> but I can reword for clarity
[10:53:28] <toddmparker> sorry agcolom - that is a good idea
[10:54:03] <toddmparker> johnbender: that was a good read
[10:54:15] <toddmparker> if there is a simple way to add an example or two, might help
[10:54:34] <toddmparker> guessing you'll be updating the docs quite a bit once this lands
[10:54:39] <toddmparker> we can link to that 
[11:12:45] <Wilto> Heeeey mobile browser people.
[11:13:09] <Wilto> We did a thing, here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-respimg/2012Nov/0024.html
[11:13:40] <Wilto> If you‚Äôre on a browser team, or close enough to someone that is to throw a pen at them, we need feedback on stuff.
[11:41:33] <agcolom> johnbender: sorry still haven't had time to read your article... but I will... 
[11:42:20] <agcolom> (I just need to have time to read it properly!) This weekend. I promise!
[12:10:32] <johnbender> agcolom: hah don't worry about it 
[12:10:39] <johnbender> agcolom: if you end up with questions just let me know
[12:10:47] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah
[12:10:59] <johnbender> toddmparker: the docs will have lots of code snippets

[15:12:00] <_|Nix|_> D00d ... popup continues to be a d00zy ... I just finished some insane event tracking and fixed a bug in no-history popups too ...
[15:12:08] <toddmparker> ?tell _|Nix|_ The popup seems to navigate back two steps when clicking out to close on Android 4.2, maybe only when the overlay has a theme. Just tested on a Nexus 4 I borrowed. Need to try and reproduce.
[15:12:09] <bot-t> toddmparker, Okay.
[15:12:32] <_|Nix|_> Aha ... time to test ...
[15:12:33] <bot-t> (25 secs ago) <toddmparker> tell _|Nix|_ The popup seems to navigate back two steps when clicking out to close on Android 4.2, maybe only when the overlay has a theme. Just tested on a Nexus 4 I borrowed. Need to try and reproduce.
[15:12:52] <_|Nix|_> Ha! That's funny!
[15:13:17] <_|Nix|_> I thought bot-t had an echo, but then I realized the first time around it was toddmparker 
[15:13:42] <toddmparker> hey _|Nix|_ 
[15:13:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Hey ...
[15:13:52] <toddmparker> didn't know you were here
[15:14:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I just emerged from event-tracing-land.
[15:14:14] <toddmparker> i was just playing with the nexus 4 and the photo, dialog popups seem to skip back
[15:14:18] <toddmparker> sounds fun
[15:14:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Boy are things async there.
[15:14:27] <toddmparker> yeah? i bet
[15:14:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: To the bone.
[15:14:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think I got it nailed.
[15:15:05] <toddmparker> yeah? awesome.
[15:15:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Just gotta run the unit tests before I push.
[15:15:22] <toddmparker> which bug were you tracking down
[15:15:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I added another view to the popup tests where it sets the default transition to "fade" during mobileinit.
[15:16:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: One about popup triggering lots of pagechange events or something like that.
[15:17:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I accidentally broke it, but the fix was not as simple as reverting the mistake, because the mistake did reduce the number of events being triggered.
[15:17:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: And popup now gracefully handles the case where it contains a link to the page that opened it.
[15:18:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Before, when you clicked on such a link, it would just disappear, leaving you in a stale dialog state.
[15:18:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Now, it handles that case just like a normal nav case - it goes $.mobile.back();
[15:18:37] <toddmparker> great to hear, nice work
[15:19:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: D00d ... I can't believe my head can actually accomodate that code. 
[15:19:15] <toddmparker> heh, seriously
[15:20:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's really cool code, but it's very insidious ... it always looks like there's an easier way to do it, but that's a honeypot, because the consequences of any refactor are far and wide.
[15:20:18] <toddmparker> oh, do you remember how you fixed that initial popup re-position in iOS? seems to be back and I wonder why.
[15:20:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Gah!
[15:20:48] <toddmparker> it's not every single time, but fairly frequently
[15:20:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: There's a snowstorm outside my window, and it seems to be affecting popups too :)
[15:21:25] <toddmparker> heh
[15:22:10] <_|Nix|_> I think the snow's up to 8" already ...
[15:22:18] <_|Nix|_> We're supposed to get 16 by tomorrow.
[15:22:19] <toddmparker> really? yikes
[15:22:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Neah ... 16" of snow doesn't phase anyone around here. Things keep humming along.
[15:23:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: There was a story last year where Heathrow got like, 3 or 4 inches and they immediately shut down.
[15:23:27] <toddmparker> ah! that "clicking to close a popup with a themed overlay goes back 2 steps in history" isn't an android 4.2 issue, i can see it in iOS6 too
[15:23:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Meanwhile, Helsinki was doing just fine under two feet.
[15:23:32] <toddmparker> must be a real regression
[15:23:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah. I'm hoping this fix will nail it.
[15:23:54] <toddmparker> i know, places in england don't have things like plows
[15:24:01] <toddmparker> oh, so you know about it?
[15:24:05] <toddmparker> sorry
[15:24:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It also happens on the desktop for popups that have a transition.
[15:24:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... but not for those that do not have a transition.
[15:24:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's because I was getting rid of the nav handlers very late.
[15:24:47] <toddmparker> i see. ok
[15:24:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... after the transitions completed.
[15:25:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's bad because you can pick up unwanted nav events.
[15:25:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Like, if you start closing on a hashchange, you can get an extra pagebeforechange and vice versa
[15:25:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, the moral is to unbind all nav things as soon as one of them hits.
[15:26:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Same goes for no-history, believe it or not, because no-history needs pagebeforechange too.
[15:26:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... because pbc is not technically a nav event, it's a page lifecycle event.
[15:27:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Oh, and no-history also listens for clicks on data-rel='back' anchors located within the popup. So, you gotta catch that too, and yank /all/ event bindings in that case.
[15:27:59] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, yeah - event-o-rama.
[15:29:19] <toddmparker> fun times. good to have you brain wrapped around all this
[15:29:59] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the fix for this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5307 had as downside that inputs on IE7/8 became far too heigh
[15:30:13] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I fixed that with the second commit
[15:30:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Oh, I'm afraid things keep poking out from under that wrapping :)
[15:30:24] <toddmparker> ah, gotcha uGoMobi 
[15:30:31] <toddmparker> you are doing god's work debugging IE
[15:30:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that last one should wait until 1.3 because the change is too big
[15:30:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: here comes the Q...
[15:31:34] <uGoMobi> should i pick the fix for 5307 for 1.2.1 and make the inputs on IE7/8 look odd
[15:31:57] <uGoMobi> or just leave that bug in 1.2.1 and just let it all wait until 1.3
[15:32:26] <uGoMobi> I think the last option is best
[15:35:55] <toddmparker> i agree
[15:35:59] <toddmparker> wait for 1.3
[15:36:07] <uGoMobi> also... I can comment on the issue how people can easily fix the input height issue with CSS if they don't care about breaking IE7/8
[15:36:10] <uGoMobi> ok
[15:36:20] <toddmparker> comment away!
[15:36:26] <uGoMobi> will do :)
[15:36:46] <toddmparker> alright, I need to head out but will check in when I can. I'll try to work on more demos and RWD stuff
[15:37:07] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: let's crank on docs stuff next week if possible, be fun to use the new panel widget there 
[15:38:30] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 2 new commits to 06master: 02http://git.io/shfk0g
[15:38:30] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 143d7ef95 15Gabriel Schulhof: Popup unit tests: Add test for checking whether popup goes back two history entries instead of just one.
[15:38:30] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 1470103a5 15Gabriel Schulhof: Popup: Unbind nav and click delegate events as soon as the process of closing the popup starts.
[15:39:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That should take care of the go-back-two-pages problem.
[15:39:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, finishing some other things this weekend so I can focus on docs/demos until 1.3 release
[15:39:32] <uGoMobi> nice _|Nix|_ 
[15:39:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's see how it holds up in real world testing.
[15:40:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: how's the Nexus 4 with Android 4.2?
[15:43:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Another popup bug (present in 1.2.0): Open "Methods" from the menu popup example and go back. The transition is like Bam!Baaaaaaam! instead of the smooth Baaaaam!
[15:43:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Noticed that while fixing this bug.
[15:45:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... but I think that's a story for another time.
[15:45:12] * _|Nix|_ go bed now - L8R all!
[15:45:15] <uGoMobi> I just read that the Lumia 920 pre-orders beat the pre-orders of all previous iPhone, Samsung and HTC releases here in Holland
[15:45:23] <uGoMobi> good night _|Nix|_
