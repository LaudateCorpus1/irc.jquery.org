[08:18:47] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:20:06] <Wilto> Hey guys.
[08:58:30] <jzaefferer> hey Wilto and others. Someone interested in providing test and patch for this window.innerHeight issue? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6724#comment:17
[09:11:34] <gseguin> wow _|Nix|__ you've got a popup-widget fan!
[10:00:41] <johnbender> toddparker: what's this tech cabal thing?
[10:17:34] <Wilto> johnbender: No Todd today—he’s out for the day, I think.
[10:20:53] <Wilto> jzaefferer: A core commit, eh?
[10:23:37] <jzaefferer> Wilto: Hells yeah!
[10:31:57] <Wilto> jzaefferer: It would mean pulling in some of our orientation detection stuff, mind you.
[10:32:19] <Wilto> jzaefferer: Ain’t nothin’ simple when it comes to mobile. See http://tripleodeon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/table.html
[10:36:07] <Wilto> I think kinblas has spent the most time wading through this territory.
[10:40:04] <jzaefferer> uhm, okay
[10:40:16] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin, did you see that? http://tripleodeon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/table.html
[10:42:40] * kinblas shudders
[10:42:55] <kinblas> mobile is just a mess in terms of getting the window width/height
[10:43:19] <kinblas> it depends on device as well as orientation ... and it depends on when the user queries for the width/height
[10:43:28] <kinblas> can't rely on orientationchange alone
[10:43:38] <kinblas> because it can fire, but eh resize may not have happened yet
[10:43:41] <kinblas> blah blah blah
[10:44:29] <Wilto> Right, exactly.
[10:44:49] <Wilto> You’ll need our normalized orientationShiz stuff, and then further shenanigans.

[14:09:04] <gseguin> johnbender: is the navigation test hosed or am i doing something wrong?
[14:09:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, seems like he's hellbent on finding /all/ the bugs :)
[14:09:39] <gseguin> it stops executing at test #14: "external page is removed from the DOM after pagehide"

[14:49:17] <gseguin> Anybody has an opinion on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3996 ?
[14:49:18] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by zonak (3w, 2d ago): Allowing custom states for checkboxes.
[14:54:06] <johnbender> gseguin: it might be, I haven't checked in on the server in a while and it seems like something should have broken by now
[14:54:28] <johnbender> I don't have my key authentication with me today
[14:54:36] <gseguin> johnbender: neh it was the pull I was working on that broke it
[14:54:40] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[15:18:27] <gseguin> kinblas: I'm looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4107
[15:18:27] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by deAtog (2w, 7h ago): Fix for issue #3347 - pagebeforechange being called twice
[15:18:50] <gseguin> you had a little talk with deAtog, didn't you?
[15:20:06] <gseguin> I've tested the PR it doesn't break our tests but that change kinda scares me
[15:20:50] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't recall that one but we should handle that internally
[15:20:57] <johnbender> it affects a lot of things
[15:21:41] <gseguin> he basically split changePage into _changePage and changePage to avoid the recursion
[15:21:56] <gseguin> and get rid of the extra pagebeforechange
[15:29:24] <johnbender> that actually reminds me
[15:29:33] <johnbender> I need to merge in my fix to 3980
[15:31:40] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/johnbender/jquery-mobile/blob/grunt/build/tasks/css.js
[15:32:56] <johnbender> I tired using the built in templating for somethings but it's not much help
[15:32:57] <gseguin> johnbender: pretty verbose
[15:33:00] <johnbender> in terms of code clarity
[15:33:39] <johnbender> gseguin: it's about the same as the build target in terms of understandability
[15:33:42] <johnbender> the actual issue is ...
[15:33:52] <johnbender> https://github.com/johnbender/jquery-mobile/blob/grunt/build/tasks/config.js
[15:33:59] <johnbender> all those helpers
[15:34:42] <gseguin> heh :)
[15:35:43] <johnbender> the worst part seems to be that there's no sync exec
[15:36:58] <johnbender> gseguin: oh and something you might be able to help with
[15:37:12] <gseguin> shoot
[15:37:18] <johnbender> the optimizeCss options don't appear to work for my requirejs config objects
[15:37:26] <johnbender> otherwise require.optimize is the same
[15:39:58] <gseguin> johnbender: which version of requirejs do you have?
[15:40:23] <johnbender> 1.0.6
[15:40:32] <gseguin> I think that keepComment option made it to 1.0.8
[15:40:38] <johnbender> kewl
[15:41:54] <johnbender> cool
[15:41:58] <johnbender> the diffs are matching up in that case
[15:42:00] <johnbender> thanks
[15:48:58] <johnbender> gseguin: it's entirely possible I'm just doing all the things wrong, but this has not been fun thusfar
[15:52:19] <gseguin> did you have ben_alman review the changes?
[15:52:46] <gseguin> maybe he can suggest easier solutions
[15:52:54] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[15:54:07] <johnbender> gseguin: no like I said to wilto I figured I would at least try first
[15:54:09] <johnbender> second day
[15:54:23] <johnbender> better to get to a dead end or at least try to get to one
[15:54:42] <johnbender> gseguin: it would benefit from your eye just because i'm not sure I'm using the file manip api properly
[15:54:59] <johnbender> gseguin: one example is that I can use the grunt.file api for some of the things
[15:55:13] <gseguin> I try to avoid the Sync API at all cost
[15:55:17] <johnbender> ...
[15:55:25] <gseguin> but that's because I wrote a service
[15:55:31] <johnbender> of course
[15:55:41] <johnbender> but that would be silly in this case
[15:56:47] <gseguin> let me know when you pushed things that are in a somewhat working state and I'll take a look
[15:56:56] <gseguin> hopefully later today or tomorrow
[15:57:57] <johnbender> gseguin: the css build is working
[15:58:03] <johnbender> just need to add the minification
[15:58:09] <johnbender> but I'm punting on that for a bit
[15:58:16] <johnbender> the diffs are good
[15:58:25] <johnbender> so you can take a look at that as of now
[15:59:28] <gseguin> k
