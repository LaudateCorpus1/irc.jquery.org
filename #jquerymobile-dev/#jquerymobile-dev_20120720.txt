[08:11:58] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3203 on jquery-mobile (indyEssl; 7m, 2w ago): Symbian v3 is not jquery mobile ready
[08:23:09] <uGoMobi> hi toddparker
[08:43:40] <toddparker> hi uGoMobi
[08:43:55] <uGoMobi> enjoying Symbian?
[08:43:59] <uGoMobi> :(
[08:44:46] <uGoMobi> it's really the IE among the mobile browsers if you ask me
[09:47:21] <toddparker> it is uGoMobi
[09:47:30] <toddparker> it is so buggy
[09:47:40] <toddparker> technically it's webkit but gets so much wrong
[09:47:40] <uGoMobi> yeah hopeless
[09:47:58] <toddparker> feels like a time warp whenever i use a Nokia, even a pretty new one
[09:48:14] <toddparker> brb, lunch
[09:48:26] <uGoMobi> ok, enjoy your lunch
[10:35:04] <agcolom> hi!
[10:56:58] <toddparker> hi agcolom
[10:57:16] <toddparker> uGoMobi: thoughts on the popup focus behavior?
[10:57:35] <toddparker> if you open a popup, scroll the page then tap out to close, it jumps you back up
[10:57:48] <toddparker> something feels off
[10:58:04] <toddparker> wp7 is really wacky
[10:58:12] <toddparker> each button keeps the focus outline
[10:58:17] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: you around?
[10:58:40] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yeah I noticed the jumping too sometimes on Android
[11:00:55] <agcolom> toddparker: Hi! we're on https://irccloud.com/#!/irc.freenode.net:6667/%23jqueryui-dev
[11:06:18] <uGoMobi> toddparker: it scrolls up until the button you clicked to open the popup is at the top of the page right?
[11:06:50] <agcolom> toddparker: new highlighting is up
[11:07:09] <toddparker> yeah uGoMobi
[11:07:13] <toddparker> feels...off
[11:07:21] <agcolom> and those fonts... I'm in love with the 'a' (see http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/category/widgets/)
[11:07:47] <toddparker> proximal nova is really nice
[11:07:53] <toddparker> proxima
[11:08:17] <agcolom> I didn't know this font! It is indeed very nice!
[11:08:25] <toddparker> looks good
[11:08:31] <toddparker> highlighting
[11:08:43] <toddparker> see you got the header in
[11:09:14] <agcolom> we're wondering if there's going to be a conflict between the resources folder that we use for the api docs and the jqm resources page... (on ui-dev channel)
[11:11:32] <agcolom> toddparker: we're just keeping that in mind at the moment as a possible conflict for the future ;-)
[11:13:11] <agcolom> toddparker: yes, the header is in... and the midder ;-)
[11:15:17] <agcolom> toddparker: I tweeted you btw about adding the book from Raymond & Andy to the home page.
[11:22:45] <uGoMobi> toddparker: what are we going to do with Opera transitions?
[11:24:34] <uGoMobi> toddparker: if that should go into 1.2 we probably want to have it in alpha already
[11:29:51] <uGoMobi> I have to go... will catch up later
[11:44:00] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Pong!
[11:44:30] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: That happens because focus is returned to the button that opened the popup.
[11:46:29] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Do the same thing with custom select menus in 1.1.1 and you will see the same jump.
[12:16:55] <_|Nix|_> Have you noticed that when you go to jquerymobile.com, the page jumps to "Powered by Codiqa"?
[12:18:17] <_|Nix|_> ... and when you use the scrollbar to go to the top of the page and then hit Ctrl+L to enter a location, you get an input alert saying "Enter line number:".
[12:18:22] <_|Nix|_> This is bad.

[13:03:57] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no issue found
[13:05:32] <gseguin> gnarf: what is there to do?
[13:06:06] * gseguin hasn't followed closely
[13:08:07] <gnarf> gseguin: so I'm moving the jquerymobile.com domain over to a new machine
[13:08:18] <gnarf> because the one its on is being turned off on monday
[13:08:55] <gnarf> currently, i just copied everything (database/directory) over, and set up a few things (read the issue) - but could use someone who knows all the features of the site to make sure it still works with that hosts entry on their machine :)
[13:11:23] * gseguin tries it out
[13:13:35] <gseguin> gnarf: /test /branches and /download-builder seem to work fine
[13:13:48] <gseguin> and the website too
[13:13:50] <gnarf> coo
[13:14:03] <gnarf> thanks for the cursory look :)
[13:19:45] <gnarf> do you know anything about this gitpostcommit crontab gseguin?
[13:20:07] <gseguin> nope
[13:20:13] <gseguin> that'd be johnbender

[14:24:50] <_|Nix|_> WTF?!

[14:24:56] <_|Nix|_> Weird ...
[14:25:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, it's a command line option, so I don't think its localized.
