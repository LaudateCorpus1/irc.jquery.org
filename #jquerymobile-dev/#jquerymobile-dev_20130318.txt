[07:16:06] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[07:17:47] <frequent> I'm sort of done with table refresh: demo toggle (http://bit.ly/134pJLV), demo reflow (http://bit.ly/16EmERK)
[07:18:13] <frequent> Questions: Can you have a look? Do I need to include unit tests in the PR?
[07:34:35] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[07:34:44] <uGoMobi> sure, will give it a look
[07:35:06] <frequent> I'm not happy with calling "tablerefesh" but for now it works
[07:35:08] <uGoMobi> frequent: the JS is minified 
[07:35:18] <frequent> ups. 1sec
[07:36:38] <frequent> ok
[07:36:50] <frequent> try again
[07:39:14] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:47:47] <uGoMobi> frequent: why the redraw method? that is actually the refresh method
[07:48:08] <frequent> yes
[07:48:26] <uGoMobi> no need to bind to refresh or table refresh... if you rename redraw to refresh it should work
[07:48:43] <uGoMobi> or maybe I miss something :)
[07:49:16] <frequent> somehow I had trouble using refresh, but since it works in all the other widgets... it is likely me :-)
[07:49:17] <uGoMobi> the widget factory take care of the event binding
[07:49:21] <frequent> will try again
[07:49:31] <uGoMobi> great, thanks!
[07:50:12] <frequent> uGoMobi: one question on listview filter:
[07:50:17] <uGoMobi> sure
[07:50:32] <frequent> is it possible to disable the filter altogether? 
[07:50:41] <frequent> I'm having a hard time trying to unbind or preventDefault
[07:51:05] <frequent> so I can hook up the filter to my own logic
[07:52:43] <gseguin> toddmparker: ping
[07:52:47] <uGoMobi> frequent: there is the "beforefilter" event
[07:53:03] <uGoMobi> so you use custom filter callback
[07:53:13] <uGoMobi> s/so you use/so you can use/
[07:53:44] <uGoMobi> or is that not what you are looking for?
[07:54:29] <uGoMobi> frequent: see this demo http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/autocomplete/autocomplete-remote.php
[07:55:47] <frequent> "beforefilter" would be good I think. I want to attach my own logic, which refreshes the whole listview, so I'm not returning the true/false the filterCallback is asking for. 
[07:55:58] <frequent> uGoMobi: I give the link a try. Thanks!
[07:56:13] <uGoMobi> frequent: np, good luck!

[10:34:35] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[10:34:50] <uGoMobi> frequent: pong
[10:34:56] <frequent> I had a look at the autocomplete. Binding to beforefilter works. Thanks
[10:35:08] <frequent> but the JQM filter still runs. See here: bit.ly/15hUnNo
[10:35:16] <frequent> http://bit.ly/15hUnNo
[10:35:34] <frequent> I added a few list items. Once you trigger autocomplete the items are filtered and hidden. 
[10:37:17] <uGoMobi> frequent: what do you want to use the filter for?
[10:38:53] <frequent> I have a default set of list items, which I'm loading. On entering something in the filter, I'm requerying items from the database, replace all existing entries and add the new ones. "So I need the filter, but not it's filtering". Just hard to switch off. 
[10:39:07] <frequent> I need to leave office. Will be online in an hour again. 
[10:39:18] <frequent> so we can postpone, too
[10:39:22] <uGoMobi> frequent: ah ok
[11:29:19] <agcolom>  good evening... anyone around?
[11:30:39] <agcolom> re: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/api/events.html (last entry) is animationComplete an event? 
[11:38:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi
[11:38:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: no it's not an event
[11:39:07] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it's a method

[12:14:52] <gseguin> hey agcolom 
[12:26:56] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: gseguin: I updated 1.2-stable to jQuery core 1.8.3 for the 1.2.1 release (1.1.2 remains core 1.7.2)
[12:27:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: can you update this in the blog post?
[12:27:53] <gseguin> toddmparker: toddmparker___: The test deploys were done on Friday
[12:28:36] <gseguin> toddmparker: toddmparker___: Let me know when I can tag
[12:30:17] <uGoMobi> BTW - I am not sure against which core version Jenkins test the 1.2-stable branch but I tested against 1.7.2 and 1.8.3
[12:34:12] <gseguin> uGoMobi: it tests against: 1.7.1, 1.7.2 and 1.8.0
[12:34:22] <gseguin> uGoMobi: do you want me to update that?
[12:34:41] <uGoMobi> gseguin: hey
[12:35:06] <uGoMobi> gseguin: if it's not much work
[12:35:22] <uGoMobi> gseguin: but I suppose we stop testing this branch after the release
[12:35:24] <gseguin> uGoMobi: which versions should I put?
[12:35:55] <gseguin> uGoMobi: just the tip of 1.7 and 1.8?
[12:36:06] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:36:11] <gseguin> done
[12:36:14] <uGoMobi> I already tested them though
[12:36:16] <uGoMobi> ah ok :)
[12:36:19] <uGoMobi> cool

[12:55:22] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Do you think it would be possible to set up the unit tests so JS exceptions end up on the console?
[12:55:47] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ostensibly that's an option to qunit
[12:55:51] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I find that those exceptions not caught by qunit and presented as "global error" messages are simply discarded.
[12:55:51] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no-catch or some such
[12:56:00] <johnbender> oops nevermind :)
[12:56:08] * johnbender crawls back into his hole
[12:56:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I've had tests simply time out while in Chrome there was an error on the console.
[12:56:55] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: so you'd like console.error to redirect to stderr
[12:56:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: o.O
[12:57:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: For example if the error happens during library load.
[12:57:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah yes, I know what you mean
[12:57:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: No idea. Is that what I would like?
[12:57:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Like undefined references during library load should end up on the console.
[12:58:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: For example, currently navigation/event is timing out on travis, and I have no idea why - it's working fine locally, both in phantomjs and in Chrome.
[12:58:53] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: would that: https://github.com/JamesMGreene/phantomjs-extensions/ help ?
[12:59:16] * _|Nix|_ takes a gander
[13:00:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Ummm ... console.log works in phantomjs ... I can put a console.log inside popup and it /will/ pring.
[13:00:20] <_|Nix|_> s/pring/print/
[13:01:31] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: oh that's right
[13:01:43] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: sorry switching context
[13:02:18] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: but exceptions don't get printed on the console is that right?
[13:02:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Maybe there's console.log but no console.error ...
[13:02:30] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That's right.
[13:03:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: If qunit catches an exception, it will get printed the same way a test failure gets printed, however, a completely uncaught exception just falls on the floor.
[13:03:32] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, exceptions that happen early, like during library load, are uncaught.
[13:03:50] <gseguin> I would ask James M Green
[13:04:01] <gseguin> he hangs out on #jquery-dev 
[13:04:30] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK. Thanks!
[13:04:33] <gseguin> he seems to be pretty knowledgeable about PhantomJS
[13:04:44] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: you're welcome, sorry I couldn't help
[13:04:58] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: NP. You have helped.
[13:05:10] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I have dereferenced you as a pointer ;)
[13:05:54] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: MAN! I'm going to get marked for garbage collection soon
[13:08:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Nah ... you're a memory leak I'll be glad to put up with :)
[13:10:27] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I have a question on another topic: Why do we depend in core on json!../package.json, if we need to manually inject the version in onBuildWrite() anyway?
[13:11:00] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: that's a good question
[13:11:48] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I guess it was so we could use our AMD modules in the demo in dev mode as opposed to PHP
[13:12:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I mean, if there are instances where requirejs will be used on our code in the traditional way, i.e., json!../package.json really does return a module and the value of __version__ really is set from the data inside that module, then we should keep it.
[13:12:50] <gseguin> just in dev mode
[13:13:31] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: You're right I think that can be removed most likely
[13:13:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Actually, if we set __version__ = "dev", and then version: __version__ later on, we can still replace __version__ by hand in onBuildWrite ...
[13:14:36] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: so the point was to use the version in package.json in the module mode
[13:14:40] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I wouldn't mind, except that the dependency makes it really hard to use individual jQM modules within a larger AMD framework.
[13:14:45] <gseguin> but I don't know if that's useful
[13:14:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That's still possible with onBuildWrite.
[13:15:13] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: However, it's not possible with just requirejs if we remove that dep.
[13:15:25] <gseguin> hmm when I say module mode I mean unbuilt mode
[13:16:05] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I guess I should say micro-modules
[13:16:07] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I guess the real solution would be for me to figure out how come both the json plugin and the text plugin ignore my paths settings.
[13:16:35] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: what do you mean?
[13:16:59] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: When I put jqm: "../jqm/js" in my paths (in web-ui-fw), all JS deps are looked up correctly except the json dep.
[13:18:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, if a file from js/my/widget depends on jqm/jquery.mobile.core, then building the library will break, because the json plugin looks for package.json in js/package.json not jqm/package.json
[13:18:14] <_|Nix|_> jqm is a subdirectory of web-ui-fw.
[13:18:29] <_|Nix|_> It's also a git submodule pointing to 1.3-stable.
[13:18:55] <gseguin> the path to json needs to be declared explicitly if it's not in the same dir as require.js
[13:19:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, I've had no choice but to ln -s ../jqm/package.json js/package.json ; ln -s jqm/package.json from web-ui-fw.
[13:19:27] <gseguin> oh I see
[13:19:55] <gseguin> ok so what we can do to address that is to namespace and associate a path to the namespace
[13:20:15] <gseguin> so we declare: "jquery/mobile"
[13:20:31] <gseguin> and then we reference json!jquery/mobile/package.json
[13:20:40] <gseguin> instead of "../"
[13:20:47] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: does that make sense?
[13:21:25] <gseguin> and then in your web-ui-fw you just change the ref to "jquery/mobile"

[13:21:57] <_|Nix|_> Ha! ^^^ here we go! People putting crazy stuff inside tables :)
[13:22:13] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I dunno enough about requirejs to see through the whole thing, but I can definitely try that.
[13:23:56] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I haven't tried anything fancier than { baseUrl: "js", paths: { "jqm": "../jqm/js" } } so far ...
[13:27:33] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: When are you switching web-ui-fw to grunt?
[13:28:03] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I already have.

[13:32:40] <toddmparker> i'd like to do a  planning session for 1.4 to cover theming this week with you and uGoMobi 
[13:33:30] <maxlynch> Sure
[13:33:39] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[13:35:29] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: is what's on the jqm branch the latest and greatest?

[13:39:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yes. jqm is L&G :)
[13:39:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That'd be awesome! Thanks!
[13:39:50] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The jqm submodule is set to 1.3-stable ...
[13:40:34] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... but I suppose it can be moved to master if we need to rely on a change in jQM that cannot go into 1.3-stable.
[13:41:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Sometimes I get the feeling it would be a lot easier to make web-ui-fw a clone of jQM with some additional widgets. Then I wouldn't need to learn all this stuff about grunt ... but, OTOH, it's cool to learn new stuff.

[14:01:18] <toddmparker> gseguin: is there a view of the demos too?
[14:02:08] <gseguin> toddmparker: 1.1-stable would be the closest you get to it
[14:02:41] <toddmparker> ok, that's fine. just wasn't sure if there was a different URL I should look at instead
[14:03:54] <agcolom> hey all :-)
[14:05:58] <agcolom> toddmparker: hi! have any FF OS phones arrived at your office yet?
[14:11:29] <toddmparker> agcolom: yep
[14:11:36] <toddmparker> they work but are very slow
[14:11:51] <toddmparker> which means we really need to simplify our js and css
[14:11:55] <agcolom> ok, good that they have arrived :-) I'll let Brad know...
[14:12:02] <toddmparker> thanks!
[14:12:12] <agcolom> oh dear :( (slow)
[14:12:29] <agcolom> yes, someone complained to them that they were slow with the JQM scolling
[14:13:04] <agcolom> is it something they can work on do you think on their side to improve the perf?
[14:17:54] <toddmparker> they are intentionally targeting low end phones so all the css we use is hard for the device i think when scrolling
[14:18:04] <toddmparker> page enhancement times are abysmal too
[14:20:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We really need to look into loading widgets lazily ...
[14:20:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That is, you only define a widget when you're about to enhance the first one.
[14:21:16] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey. updated table refresh. reflow = http://bit.ly/16EmERK,  toggle = http://bit.ly/134pJLV. 
[14:21:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, for example, if the opening page has no widgets, there's no need to define any widgets before showing the page.
[14:22:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: This has major implications though - for example, initSelector can no longer reside inside the widget, because we need it to decide whether we need to define a given widget for a page.
[14:22:34] <agcolom> toddmparker: Brad says that the perf problems are reproducible with Firefox on Android
[14:23:08] <_|Nix|_> The funny thing is, whenever I make a perf improvement, FF seems to benefit the most :)
[14:24:44] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah that looks good!
[14:24:51] <uGoMobi> nice
[14:25:18] <frequent> yeah. seems to work well
[14:27:08] <agcolom> toddmparker: uGoMobi _|Nix|_ : Brad says that if we spot perf issues specific to FF, we can file a bug issue 
[14:29:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I just tested 1.1- and 1.2-stable on retina and icons look good
[14:31:09] <toddmparker> must be chrome
[14:31:17] <toddmparker> agcolom: cool
[14:31:47] <toddmparker> hi frequent!
[14:31:55] <frequent> hey
[14:32:00] <toddmparker> thanks for helping out with adding the table refresh methods
[14:32:07] <uGoMobi> frequent: do you know how to write unit test for table refresh method?
[14:32:07] <frequent> np
[14:32:22] <frequent> I had a quick look at the existing tests
[14:32:45] <frequent> anything specific I will need to look out for?
[14:33:03] <uGoMobi> no, not really

[14:40:31] <toddmparker> I think 1.1.2 is all set
[14:40:36] <toddmparker> blog post is in good shape
[14:40:57] <toddmparker> the CDN links looked ok, Zip too
[14:41:18] <uGoMobi> ah I forgot about the copyright sorry
[14:41:44] <toddmparker> no worries
[14:41:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin: interesting... http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.1.2/jquery.mobile-1.1.2.js has no date/time after the SHA
[14:42:21] <gseguin> uGoMobi: yeah that's weird
[14:42:31] <uGoMobi> oh, was the same with 1.1.1
[14:42:44] <uGoMobi> 1.2.1 has it
[14:43:14] <toddmparker> odd
[14:45:48] <toddmparker> just posted the 1.1.2 blog post to BC for some review
[14:49:28] <uGoMobi> blog post looks good to go
[14:50:11] <gseguin> toddmparker: toddmparker blog post looks good
[14:50:27] <toddmparker> ah, just remembered
[14:50:33] <toddmparker> 1.1.x shipped with 1.7.1
[14:50:42] <toddmparker> so i just updated the copy paste block to 1.7.2
[14:50:47] <toddmparker> that sound right?
[14:51:02] <gseguin> sounds good
[14:51:10] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#103 (master - 8d36366 : Gabriel "_|Nix|_" Schulhof): The build was broken.

[14:51:45] <toddmparker> and 1.2.1 should be 1.8.3 - right?
[14:52:05] <toddmparker> we shipped with 1.8.2
[14:52:10] <gseguin> toddmparker: correct
[14:52:16] <toddmparker> k
[14:52:30] <uGoMobi> one sec
[14:53:24] <uGoMobi> the 1.1-stable branch mentions core 1.7.2 but is actually using 1.7.1
[14:53:41] <toddmparker> we should update that
[14:53:46] <uGoMobi> on it
[14:53:52] <toddmparker> same with 1.2-stable (to 1.8.3)
[14:53:55] <toddmparker> thanks uGoMobi 
[14:54:12] <toddmparker> so easy to copy paste and mess these things up
[14:54:19] <uGoMobi> we really should automate this one day :)
[14:54:21] <toddmparker> i grabbed the block from 1.3
[14:54:24] <toddmparker> yep
[14:54:32] <uGoMobi> yeah tricky I know
[14:55:23] <toddmparker> i think we should do 1.1.2 today/tomorrow and do 1.2.1 a few days later just to avoid confusion. so similar #-wise
[14:55:56] <gseguin> toddmparker:  I just updated the Phantom build on Jenkins for 1.1-stable
[14:56:04] <toddmparker> cool
[14:56:15] <gseguin> toddmparker: it now tests against 1.6.4, 1.7.1 and 1.7.2
[14:56:38] <gseguin> so we should be covered

[14:57:59] <gseguin> 1.2-stable was updated this morning
[14:58:42] <gseguin> toddmparker: 1.2-stable is tested against 1.7.2 and 1.8.3
[14:58:58] <gseguin> toddmparker: I can add other versions if you want
[15:00:09] <toddmparker> no, that's cool. just didn't know if it was the latest 1.8.x
[15:00:47] <toddmparker> so i think 1.1.2 looks ready to go
[15:01:02] <toddmparker> anyone see anything?

[15:14:57] <toddmparker> i'm the king of dumb mistakes

[15:15:25] <toddmparker> here, i have 7,944 people watching my every dumb move
[15:17:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: want to replace the logo in 1.1.2 ?
[15:17:29] <toddmparker> ah, we could, yes
[15:17:35] <toddmparker> should really
[15:17:35] <uGoMobi> or shall we add "classic"? ;-)
[15:17:40] <toddmparker> heh
[15:17:46] <toddmparker> so 1.2 is up to date
[15:17:58] <toddmparker> just checked
[15:18:12] <toddmparker> i can swap it

[15:31:57] <uGoMobi> and same for 1.2-stable
[15:32:00] <uGoMobi> that ok?

[15:33:05] <uGoMobi> from the gbs page
[15:33:18] <toddmparker> i see. not sure we should not update the browser list on the older releases

[15:33:42] <toddmparker> hmm
[15:33:51] <toddmparker> on second hand, these lists are really old
