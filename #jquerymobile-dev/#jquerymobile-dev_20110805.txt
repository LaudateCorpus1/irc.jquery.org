[08:49:35] <toddparker>  mornin
[09:30:08] <toddparker> 408 issues!
[09:30:23] <toddparker> course a ton are either bunk or nitpicky
[10:32:43] <kinblas> gseguin: in the transition branch, did you only modify 2 files? navigation.js and transition.js?
[10:34:36] <kinblas> oh I meant 3 files ... including transitions.css
[10:48:33] <gseguin> hey kinblas, sorry was in a meeting
[10:48:49] <gseguin> yeah, 3 files
[10:48:57] <gseguin> why?
[10:55:39] <kinblas> gseguin: was curious because I want to update the branch to the HEAD
[10:56:22] <kinblas> gseguin: also there are other files like fixedHeaderFooter and slider that need to be modified because of the keyframe to transitions change
[10:56:43] <kinblas> ... they need to change because the complete event name is different
[10:56:59] <gseguin> oh I didn't realize that
[10:57:14] <kinblas> btw I got things to work great by switching back to the original transition code
[10:57:38] <kinblas> and just tweaking the callback name
[10:57:49] <kinblas> you can see it here:
[10:57:59] <kinblas> http://webpro.host.adobe.com/people/jblas/jqm3/
[10:58:08] <kinblas> if you load it on an iphone/ipod
[10:58:23] <kinblas> you'll see that it slides without the gaps
[10:58:30] <gseguin> oh nice!
[10:58:56] <gseguin> just tested on android
[10:58:59] <gseguin> looks great
[10:59:04] <gseguin> well done sir!
[10:59:23] <gseguin> oh
[10:59:41] <gseguin> on the slide up/down reverse
[10:59:59] <kinblas> heh
[11:00:00] <gseguin> the original page is "pushing"
[11:00:03] <kinblas> ok I need to fix that
[11:00:42] <kinblas> it's just a css target thing
[11:01:22] * gseguin tries on the iPod touch
[11:03:24] <aaronmcadam> yeah trying flip on ff5, when you try to close the dialog, it doesn't work
[11:03:26] <gseguin> slide up/down still have the flashing of the original page on non-reverse transitions
[11:03:32] <aaronmcadam> excuse if it's not related at all
[11:04:49] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: you talking about the HEAD or my URL above?
[11:04:56] <aaronmcadam> your url
[11:05:23] <gseguin> aaronmcadam: flip does not work on FF, only on webkit
[11:05:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah, the other transitions don't look too bad
[11:06:13] <aaronmcadam> is the moz syntax much different from webkit?
[11:06:41] <kinblas> looks like spin is still using the keyframe CSS
[11:06:45] <kinblas> we'll have to convert that too
[11:07:24] <kinblas> whoops wrong transition
[11:07:26] <gseguin> yeah I was struggling with the other transitions so did not spend time on that
[11:10:20] <gseguin> aaronmcadam: the rotateY transform does not work on FF yet
[11:10:55] <aaronmcadam> cool
[11:11:20] <kinblas> gseguin: ah ok I see the flashing you are talking about ... I think I know how to fix that
[11:12:25] <gseguin> I think it's because when we remove the transition classes we end up with 2 pages with ui-page-active for a while
[11:16:12] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddparker: I'm focusing on the refactor a bit today, should i be doing that or going through the pull requests
[11:16:20] <_nickel> just want to make sure I'm hitting the important stuff
[11:19:11] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah that was exactly what I was thinking. I think we just need to swap the order in which we remove the classes
[11:20:00] <gseguin> kinblas: I had the same idea yesterday but didn't have time to try it out before happy hour started
[11:20:04] <gseguin> :P
[11:36:51] <toddparker> _nickel -
[11:36:55] <toddparker> either is fine
[11:37:08] <_nickel> toddparker: alright I'm itching to get this refactor finished as soon as possible
[11:37:09] <toddparker> try to keep an eye on pulls and chip away at 'em
[11:37:13] <_nickel> its a long slog with it
[11:37:17] <_nickel> cool
[11:37:17] <toddparker> but you can focus on select
[11:37:24] * _nickel thanks toddparker
[11:37:29] <toddparker> it's nice to be abl eto zone in
[11:37:51] <toddparker> kinblas - sounds like you're making some good progress
[11:45:28] <_nickel> scottjehl: you around?
[11:45:43] <_nickel> scottjehl: nevermind
[11:45:48] <_nickel> answered my own question
[12:09:16] <scottjehl> hey sorry
[12:14:25] <_nickel> scottjehl: no worries it was 2 seconds of indecision
[12:14:45] <_nickel> only 3 methods left
[12:14:59] <_nickel> buildList, open, and a bit more work on create to go along with what I've already done
[12:15:13] <_nickel> then I can think about moving these into seperate plugins
[12:17:40] <scottjehl> excellent
[12:17:48] <scottjehl> nice goin' _nickel
[12:18:19] <_nickel> bigger win, imho, is I'm adding tests for each thing I move
[12:18:32] <_nickel> select coverage is going up significantly
[12:19:37] <scottjehl> that's great
[12:19:53] <toddparker> i just finished typing in the kinblas URL of doom
[12:19:59] <toddparker> looks super smooth
[12:20:21] <kinblas> that's my middle name
[12:20:47] <toddparker> I thought is was "Kin"
[12:21:31] <kinblas> oh that's right, my first name is "The"
[12:21:52] <toddparker> heh
[12:21:58] <toddparker> seriously smooth
[12:22:29] <toddparker> you already know about the slide back transitons needing to overlay
[12:23:14] <toddparker> but it looks like the pop close animation adding the pop "in" transition to the target page
[12:23:49] <kinblas> apparently mIRC didn't like my name changes :-)
[12:24:02] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: gseguin: scottjehl: https://github.com/johnbender/jquery-mobile/blob/decoupled-select/js/jquery.mobile.forms.select.js
[12:24:07] <_nickel> for continued status
[12:24:28] <kinblas> _nickel: is that a fork?
[12:24:39] <_nickel> I rebased to grab some commits from master
[12:24:55] <_nickel> and I didn't want to force on to the tree at jqm in case people are working with it
[12:25:09] <_nickel> so I just keep pushing it to my personal to keep it public and backed up
[12:25:18] <_nickel> until I merge
[12:44:36] <scottjehl> not sure I understand the distinction btwn that and a branch, but works for me! :)
[12:46:08] <scottjehl> _nickel, after that refactor, do you want to jump in on pushState stuff with me?
[12:46:23] <_nickel> scottjehl: hell yah
[12:46:41] <scottjehl> I'd imagine I can probably get it all functioning and then we can look for edge cases and figure out how testing will happen
[12:46:49] <_nickel> scottjehl: perfect
[12:47:41] <scottjehl> one thing I was wondering about: seems like a lot of the listview tests are really testing the nav model
[12:48:20] <scottjehl> just thinking... when we have to find all the cases where hash tests are used and won't work well with pushState, maybe some of those aren't necessary anymore (redundant with tests in navigation)
[12:48:49] <scottjehl> nested lists obviously have a place there. But some tests are just seeing if links click and end up at the right page, etc
[12:54:18] <_nickel> scottjehl: definitely worth evaluating and pruning
[12:54:46] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddparker: when you click on a native select menu the pressed state seems to be stuck
[12:54:55] <_nickel> until its clicked again
[12:55:15] <_nickel> obviously thats not the case with the custom selects
[12:55:32] <_nickel> so I assume that class removal is sitting somewhere in the open method
[12:55:50] <_nickel> (which is ignored in the case of native selects)
[13:08:01] <scottjehl> _nickel. hmm. Well, the button itself never gets clicked in native selects, but I thought there was an event bound to the native select ("mousdown or click maybe?) that turned the button active
[13:08:11] <scottjehl> but there's no event to latch onto for select closing
[13:08:15] <scottjehl> so I think we used blur
[13:08:31] <_nickel> yah I'm fishing around
[13:08:32] <scottjehl> we could consider not setting active at all
[13:08:41] <_nickel> scottjehl: oh
[13:08:43] <_nickel> scottjehl: not active
[13:08:48] <_nickel> which in the default theme is blue right?
[13:08:52] <scottjehl> ya
[13:08:55] <_nickel> but the "clicked" state
[13:09:00] <_nickel> where the gradient is reversed
[13:09:07] <_nickel> err
[13:09:08] <_nickel> removed
[13:11:27] <scottjehl> we're talking about this part ya? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.forms.select.js#L182
[13:15:52] <_nickel> indeed
[13:19:13] <_nickel> scottjehl: it needs to remove the button down on change it appears
[13:19:19] <_nickel> I'll play with it a bit
[13:30:38] <_nickel> scottjehl: just needed an extra bind to remove the themed ui-btn-down-*
[13:30:45] <scottjehl> aw nice one
[13:30:57] <_nickel> scottjehl: right now its change and blur
[13:31:19] <_nickel> but the blur has questionable value because that obviously doesn't work on just clicking away
[13:31:30] <_nickel> only if focus is somewhere else
[14:04:49] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddparker: gseguin: kinblas: not sure if anyone is interested but today is Rubinius Day!
[14:04:52] <_nickel> :D
[14:04:56] <_nickel> http://rbxday.rubini.us/
[14:05:08] <_nickel> my friends Evan and Shane work on it full time
[14:05:11] <_nickel> its a ruby interpreter
[14:05:15] <_nickel> and its effing amazing
[14:05:26] <gseguin> really? I thought it was http://www.internationalbeerday.com/
[14:05:40] <_nickel> gseguin: nope
[14:05:45] <_nickel> ;p;
[14:05:47] <gseguin> :)
[15:36:59] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: create method is the only thing thats left
[18:29:53] <gseguin> well done Kin!
[18:35:22] <kinblas> gseguin: thanks ... it was tedious testing
[18:35:33] <gseguin> I can imagine
[18:35:55] <kinblas> I basically had to resort to making sure we set the display/visibility at exactly the same moment we enable the transitions
[18:35:58] <gseguin> I noticed a glitch in the pop at least
[18:36:05] <kinblas> ew really?
[18:36:12] <kinblas> I tried that a few times on ipod/ipad
[18:36:16] <gseguin> yeah
[18:36:18] <kinblas> didn't notice but I wouldn't doubt it
[18:36:30] <gseguin> I'm testing on an iPod touch 4th gen
[18:36:33] <kinblas> we're at the mercy of the browser and when it decides to reflow
[18:36:46] <kinblas> sometimes its batching of things screws us up
[18:36:50] <kinblas> batching and flushing
[18:36:56] <gseguin> yeah
[18:37:16] <gseguin> I know I've been struggling with browsers discrepancies
[18:37:55] <gseguin> so in the pop forward I see the out page flashing after the in page has come in
[18:38:36] <gseguin> but I noticed that you restore scrollTop on reverse... Kudos!
[18:38:40] <kinblas> grr ok, I think I can fix it though
[18:39:12] <kinblas> I thought I had everything working, but then again I'm rushing cause I need to go for the night
[18:39:36] <gseguin> go, it's in a branch!
[18:42:53] <kinblas> yeah I wanted to make sure I checked in something working before the weekend
[18:43:08] <kinblas> so the guys have something to bang on for Monday before we get in the office :-)
[18:43:19] <kinblas> gseguin: ok have a good weekend!
[18:43:22] <kinblas> signing off
[18:43:36] <gseguin> you too!
[18:43:40] <gseguin> ttyl
