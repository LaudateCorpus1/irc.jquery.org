[06:58:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Changed collapsible css to use class ui-btn instead of anchor as selector. Gives it higher level of specificity which is needed to override default button styling. Reverted changes of commit 5b14b55 since collapsible was the only issue and is fixed now. - Jasper de Groot

[08:28:45] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: Jason, regarding the navbar wrapping issue... I already tested my new fix on BB5 simulator and it works but can you try on real device http://ugomobi.github.com/navbar/ (shorturl and QR-code are on that page)
[08:31:54] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: On the simulator I saw that icon images are displayed wrong on BB5. Is this the same in real?
[08:32:19] <uGoMobi> BTW - I noticed simular icon image issues on Opera Mobile simulator.
[08:33:28] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ^^^ did you see issues with the icon sprite while testing on real devices?
[08:39:46] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Great job! It is working on a real BB5 device
[08:40:06] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: cool! thanks for testing!
[08:40:50] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: All of the icons on that page seem to be correct on this BB5 device
[08:42:03] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3691is this the issue you are seeing?
[08:42:04] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3691 on jquery-mobile (indyEssl; 3m, 1w ago): Icons not showing on BlackBerry 5.0
[08:42:31] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: ok, good to know. Then it's an issue with the simulator (or Windows on which I had it installed)
[08:43:38] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: What exactly was the problem you were seeing?
[08:43:51] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: on simulator it is a percentage issue with the sprite
[08:44:11] <uGoMobi> same as reported at #3691
[08:44:39] <uGoMobi> he also tested on simulator
[08:45:29] <uGoMobi> "This should not be happening in my impression, since BlackBerry 5.0 is marked as B-grade (Enhanced experience except without Ajax navigation features)." <<<< no idea what this has to do with it :-)
[08:46:51] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: so I think you can close #3691
[08:47:48] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Let me check the doc's page first
[08:48:58] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: On your test page, in the final navbar, are items 1,3,5,7 supposed to have icons? I dont see them in chrome or BB5
[08:49:51] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: no there are no icons there... sorry, that was for another test
[08:50:32] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Phew, thought we had another bug :)
[08:50:37] <uGoMobi> will change it quick to avoid confusion
[08:50:41] <uGoMobi> haha
[08:52:22] <uGoMobi> on what BB model did you test the navbar?
[08:52:36] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott ^^^
[08:53:06] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: 9000 - 5.0.0.628
[08:53:46] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: are there other BB models with different device width that run BB5?
[08:54:21] <uGoMobi> if so, it might be a good idea to test the navbar on another model as well
[09:11:10] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: I will try to find some other devices
[09:13:59] <johnbender> Looks like we have a legit failure
[09:25:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I can't for the life of me imagine why but it looks like some of the css changes you added in broke the select test
[09:25:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: and actually if you go run the test all the select menus are crazy crazy crazy wide
[09:25:41] <johnbender> and they flood the screen
[09:25:42] <johnbender> :D
[09:25:50] <uGoMobi> johnbender: hmm :-(
[09:26:11] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah it looks like you removed a merge conflict snippet in there too, not sure how that got in :(
[09:27:07] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Is there a way to enhance a given DOM subtree after I've just appended it?
[09:27:10] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah i noticed that snippet... no idea either since i used the green button
[09:27:15] <johnbender> ugh
[09:27:26] <_|Nix|_> .trigger( "create" ); ... ?
[09:27:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Say what? The select menus?
[09:27:59] <johnbender> uGoMobi: crap
[09:28:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What branch is that?
[09:28:15] <johnbender> uGoMobi: we need to find that commit with the merge conflicts and undo that
[09:28:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: 1.1-stable
[09:28:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: master is fine
[09:28:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ...
[09:28:38] <uGoMobi> johnbender: when i first run the test i got one error on with select events... tested again (few times) and error gone
[09:29:03] <uGoMobi> johnbender: this is only on 1.1-stable?
[09:29:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I can't even see the test results on 1.1-stable
[09:29:07] <johnbender> uGoMobi: correct
[09:29:21] <johnbender> the menu's overrun the screen
[09:29:27] <johnbender> uGoMobi: before you do anything though
[09:29:41] <uGoMobi> johnbender: i am going to compare select.css and .js files in master and 1.1-stable branches now
[09:29:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I recently removed the max-width off the custom select, when I switched it to popup, but I don't think I cherry-picked it to 1.1-stable. Might've accidentally though :-S
[09:29:48] <johnbender> I don't want to pile on another fix with reverting the merge commit
[09:30:37] <johnbender> I'm worried that the borked merge might have left other stuff in there that shouldn't be
[09:31:10] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I am just going to compare files and then report back here
[09:31:15] <johnbender> kk
[09:31:17] <johnbender> sounds good
[09:33:58] <_|Nix|_> The selects were broken by c2b346a7a52774a1d7d8ada54993e7462017fbcd which seems to have merged the master custom select css into 1.1-stable.
[09:34:15] <johnbender> yar
[09:34:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^
[09:34:33] <uGoMobi> looking
[09:34:43] <johnbender> that's the commit the build shows but that doesn't tell me where the merge stuff snuck in
[09:35:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That commit is not a merge, but a straight-forward commit, containing a bunch of other things, so the only fix may be to paste the line back in and make another commit.
[09:35:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Its stated purpose is "Cleaning up double spaces inside css rules" ...
[09:35:39] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm less worried about fixing the bug right now and more worried about why we had conflict markers commited
[09:35:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, I noticed that too ...
[09:36:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's the commit that removes one.
[09:36:07] <johnbender> just need to figure out where it happened so we don't miss anything
[09:36:09] <johnbender> not a big deal
[09:36:14] <johnbender> exactly
[09:36:21] <johnbender> I want to find the commit that added it
[09:36:26] <johnbender> suprisingly hard for some reason
[09:36:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Understood.
[09:36:31] <johnbender> my normal chicanery is not working
[09:37:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Is there a way to get the parent(s) of a given commit?
[09:37:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I always get stuck at this question when trying to write a script that'll walk the history.
[09:38:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... but git log and grep for the commitid may reveal something ...
[09:38:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: git log -p <filename> | grep "whatever" works fine for this but for some reason I'm not getting the results I expect
[09:38:43] <uGoMobi> johnbender: this is most probably the merge commit that causes the merge stuff ea5e7f1
[09:39:12] <johnbender> gah I'm a moron
[09:39:15] <johnbender> yah
[09:39:19] <johnbender> looking now
[09:39:23] <uGoMobi> johnbender: that commit is when I pulled a big PR using green button
[09:39:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: f6da086ac5f6289fcec0fa501eb13c1de54d5715 commits some conflict markes.
[09:39:51] <_|Nix|_> s/markes/markers/
[09:39:56] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hrm
[09:40:07] <johnbender> uGoMobi: we should probably revert that and redo it manually just to be safe
[09:40:32] <uGoMobi> hmm... it was 27 commits
[09:40:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: anything past documentation changes I try to avoid the green button but it was your own PR so that makes sense
[09:40:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah it appears the green button did a bad thing there :(
[09:41:07] <uGoMobi> not so green after all
[09:41:43] <johnbender> haha
[09:42:29] <uGoMobi> johnbender: what happened is that when i wanted to pick that "clean up whitespaces" commit into 1.1-stable i got merge conflict on select.css
[09:42:32] <johnbender> well lesson learned I guess, green button for small changesets only
[09:42:44] <uGoMobi> because of those snippets in there
[09:42:47] <johnbender> yah
[09:43:30] <uGoMobi> i removed them while "solving" the conflict and that is most probably what now causes this problem
[09:43:45] <johnbender> uGoMobi: so aside from reverting that stuff and then reapplying it the only tool we have is eyebally the css to make sure it's sane
[09:44:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: vgrep :)
[09:44:05] <johnbender> ugh
[09:44:19] <johnbender> the confluence of the two issues is making this rough
[09:46:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the select structure and from master and 1.1-stable appear to be identical
[09:46:45] <johnbender> you mentioned that you might have cherry picked something over?
[09:47:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I;m pretty sure I didn't. I think uGoMobi resolved the conflict by choosing the wrong side.
[09:47:48] <johnbender> hrm
[09:48:24] <johnbender> uGoMobi: so I
[09:48:32] <johnbender> I'm still trying to piece this together
[09:48:47] <_|Nix|_> -.ui-selectmenu { position: absolute; padding: 0; z-index: 1100 !important; width: 80%; max-width: 350px; padding: 6px; }
[09:48:50] <_|Nix|_> +.ui-selectmenu { padding: 6px; min-width: 160px; }
[09:49:05] <_|Nix|_> That needs to be reverted in css/structure/jquery.mobile.forms.select.css
[09:50:00] <johnbender> ah indeed
[09:52:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/c2b346a7a52774a1d7d8ada54993e7462017fbcd#L6L51
[09:52:24] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no commit found
[09:52:33] <johnbender> and what _|Nix|_ said
[09:52:35] <johnbender> thoughts?
[09:53:40] <uGoMobi> johnbender: not yet, I am reading your comments
[09:54:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: kk, the first was identified by _|Nix|_ which appears to be the culprit of the test failure
[09:54:12] <johnbender> the second is the one that I'm curious about
[09:56:07] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, first is clear to me now too... i deleted something that i shouldnt have when solving the conflict
[09:56:19] <johnbender> cool
[09:56:20] <uGoMobi> looking at second now
[09:56:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks for your help
[09:56:43] <johnbender> uGoMobi: seems like we've got it sorted then
[09:56:51] <johnbender> so long as the second bit doesn't raise any red flags
[09:57:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP ... I had it cached because I remembered the breakage I had seen while moving custom selects to popup and removing that max-width.
[09:57:27] <johnbender> lucky for us!
[09:57:35] <_|Nix|_> A cache hit :)
[09:59:58] <johnbender> lol my l1/l2 are anemic :(
[10:00:05] <johnbender> a few bytes at best
[10:01:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... so I'll have little chance in your remembering whether there's a function I can call to have a chunk of DOM enhanced - is there?
[10:01:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I tried .trigger( "create" ) but I'm not getting anywhere with that ...
[10:02:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you beat me to that build question lol
[10:02:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that should work
[10:02:20] <johnbender> well
[10:02:28] <johnbender> depending on what you mean by "chunk of DOM"
[10:02:41] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok i 3-double checked and just commented
[10:03:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: cool!
[10:03:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: $( "a sizable chunk of HTML" ).appendTo( $( "body" ) ).trigger( "create" );
[10:03:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi: do you want to make the quick correction for the other snippet?
[10:03:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: is it at the page level?
[10:03:55] <uGoMobi> johnbender: sure, just a commit to 1.1-stable that put that line back?
[10:03:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It's not a page. It's a popup containing a header and a content.
[10:04:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yassir
[10:04:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Like the dialog example at http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html, only created on-the-fly.
[10:04:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm, I'm not sure the create bindings are at the document level
[10:05:04] <johnbender> they should be getting called
[10:05:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Maybe I'm not making popup work with the "create" event ...
[10:05:22] <johnbender> looks like you are
[10:05:31] <johnbender> I checked :D
[10:05:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Great, so the obvious answer eliminated ...  :)
[10:05:55] <uGoMobi> johnbender and _|Nix|_ sorry and thanks for all the help fixing it!!
[10:06:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No worries.
[10:06:12] <johnbender> uGoMobi: np np, I say this to everyone but don't every feel bad about breaking the build
[10:06:18] <johnbender> that's what it's there for!
[10:06:38] <uGoMobi> you sound like Wilto ;-)
[10:06:55] <_|Nix|_> Better it break now than the night before the big release ...
[10:08:00] <johnbender> hah
[10:08:05] <johnbender> better it break before the release
[10:08:07] <johnbender> period
[10:08:12] <johnbender> even if it's the night before
[10:08:13] <johnbender> :D
[10:08:47] <johnbender> every time the build breaks it means we've caught a legitemate issue and everyone ends up a little more motivated to test
[10:09:01] <johnbender> every time a build break an test gets its assertions
[10:09:03] <_|Nix|_> *nod vehemently*
[10:12:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: i am getting confused here...
[10:12:24] <uGoMobi> .ui-selectmenu { position: absolute; padding: 0; z-index: 1100 !important; width: 80%; max-width: 350px; padding: 6px; }
[10:13:09] <uGoMobi> that should be in 1.1-stable?
[10:13:41] <uGoMobi> for the "old" custom select menu?
[10:14:51] <uGoMobi> sorry just want to be sure
[10:15:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That is currect.
[10:15:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The max-width is the important setting there.
[10:15:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok thanks!
[10:15:58] <_|Nix|_> s/cur/cor/
[10:16:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP.
[10:16:54] <agcolom> toddparker: sorry I closed my laptop last night before your last comment. I do like inline demos as well... I've had an idea today... I just need to find a bit of time to try to implement this in the XSL file...
[10:18:20] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/iewM7w
[10:18:20] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Putting back a line that I replaced by accident while solving a merge conflict. - Jasper de Groot
[10:21:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think I know what the problem is: popup, like other widgets, calls enhanceWithin in response to "create", but that enhances /within/ the target, and does not examine the target itself for enhancement.
[10:22:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: This usually works, because the target is a page, but if the target itself is a widget to be enhanced, it will be ignored.
[10:22:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, we need a .enhanceWithinIncludingToplevel() ...
[10:22:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah there's no parent page
[10:22:35] <johnbender> ?
[10:22:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Correct. I just add the skeleton for a popup, and I trigger "create" on it.
[10:23:02] <johnbender> hrm
[10:23:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Calling .popup() is not enough, because it may contain other widgets.
[10:23:15] <johnbender> right
[10:23:27] <johnbender> is there are reason it can't be added to specific page
[10:23:32] <johnbender> or is that how all popups work
[10:23:44] * johnbender is ashamed to admit he hasn't looked
[10:23:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But, I suppose I could call popup, knowing that it's supposed to be a popup, and then trigger create for the insides.
[10:24:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Popups normally reside within pages, but they can be attached anywhere.
[10:24:09] <johnbender> ah
[10:24:18] <johnbender> then I would handle the special case in popup I gues
[10:24:23] <johnbender> but
[10:24:34] <johnbender> I would, at first, require our users to put them in a page if we can
[10:24:56] <johnbender> that will save us some complexity until we figure out if that's something people will be doing frequently I guess
[10:24:59] <johnbender> my 2c
[10:25:08] <_|Nix|_> I think for the task at hand it is OK if I call .trigger( "create" ) followed by .popup() ...
[10:25:40] <johnbender> kk
[10:26:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm just thinking that it might be useful to have a function to "take this chunk and make a jqm-enhanced chunk out of it".
[10:26:19] <johnbender> feature request?
[10:26:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We already have that with enhanceWithin() but you need to know what the container is supposed to be.
[10:26:23] <johnbender> :D
[10:26:28] <johnbender> yes
[10:26:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah ...
[10:26:30] <johnbender> that is page dependent
[10:26:35] <johnbender> for a lot of reasons
[10:26:50] <johnbender> mostly config options
[10:27:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, and this is for an example anyway, so the scope is not generic.
[10:27:22] <johnbender> I think there's even a todo in there for that
[10:27:28] <johnbender> but I don't think we can tackle that right now
[10:27:45] <johnbender> yah I would just do what you need to do in this case and then wait on adding it to the code base
[10:28:11] <_|Nix|_> Absolutely.
[10:43:35] <uGoMobi> johnbender: just tested 1.1-stable and all tests passed :D
[10:43:49] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah we should be good to go
[10:43:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi: thanks

[10:47:49] <johnbender> whenver you guys want
[10:48:01] <johnbender> you can juts pull the branch and modify it directly
[10:48:17] <johnbender> thoughts on overall structure/content are also appreciated
[10:48:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I might remove the rebase section just because it doesn't help that much
[10:48:31] <johnbender> it's clumsy
[10:49:36] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah better leave it out when it probably only cause confusion
[10:49:58] <uGoMobi> johnbender: still curious what you meant by it though ;)
[10:50:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: using rebase is a good way to avoid merge commits
[10:50:14] <johnbender> unnecsessary merge commits
[10:50:19] <johnbender> definitely read that chapter in pro git
[10:50:23] <johnbender> and I can walk you through it if you want
[10:50:41] <johnbender> for whatever reason it seems to be an exceptionally hard topic to explain
[10:50:44] <johnbender> and grok
[10:51:11] <johnbender> that is, by all appearences I've had an easier time explaining some basic category theory to web developers :X
[10:51:15] <uGoMobi> johnbender: i think the term "merge commits" is what confuses me the most
[10:51:24] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:51:30] <johnbender> uGoMobi: when there's a merge conflict
[10:51:38] <johnbender> when you resolve it you're left with a merge commit
[10:51:50] <johnbender> and even when there isn't you're left with a more complex history
[10:52:05] <johnbender> `git log --graph` on master for example
[10:52:15] <johnbender> using rebase you can keep it mostly linear
[10:52:25] <johnbender> so it's easy to understand what happened when
[10:52:30] <johnbender> uGoMobi: take today
[10:52:50] <johnbender> it would have been super easy to figure all that out if our master branch history was just one big linear list of commits
[10:53:02] <johnbender> but it's not a silver bullet
[10:53:05] <johnbender> sometimes you just have to merge
[10:53:18] <johnbender> that's probably where the difficulty in understanding sneaks in
[10:53:25] <johnbender> you can't tell people "just always do this thing"
[10:53:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I am getting it
[10:54:11] <uGoMobi> looking at history tree at Git Gui and see the difference
[10:54:13] <johnbender> uGoMobi: let me know when/if you read that chapter and I can cover it a bit more in depth
[10:54:43] <uGoMobi> I read that chapter quickly yesterday but def want to give a closer look
[10:54:43] <_|Nix|_> This also helps: http://code.google.com/p/git-core/source/browse/Documentation/howto/revert-a-faulty-merge.txt
[11:01:06] <uGoMobi> johnbender: tell me if i am wrong but isn't the only thing people can do to avoid merge commits, pull upstream master just before they make the changes and then create the PR asap?
[11:04:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/ULO17w

[11:04:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] select whitespace - John Bender
[11:08:31] <johnbender> uGoMobi: right, but the more recently they've rebased the less likely the patches won't apply cleanly
[11:08:52] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I should have read the new readme Rebase section first before i said that :D
[11:08:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: also you'll see people merge things in and the commit list goes bonkers
[11:09:07] <uGoMobi> I understand
[11:09:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: also, for our purposes we merge things in directly so for the team members its obviously possible to keep things completely linear
[11:10:33] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!

[11:10:55] <uGoMobi> pfew ;-)
[11:11:04] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: Wow! Creating a dialog-like popup on-the-fly and showing it causes an exponential behaviour: The first time you create and show the popup, it is displayed once. The second time, it is displayed, hidden, and redisplayed. The third time, it is toggled like this until it is displayed a total of 4 times. Next time you click the link, 8 times. etc.
[11:11:56] <_|Nix|_> This is going to be a mother of a unit test :)

[11:14:46] <uGoMobi> instead*
[11:18:11] <agcolom> johnbender, just reading your new readme... There is one sentence that I am not too clear about (note this could be my lack of technical knowledge on the subject): "For other the other build targets, docs and zip, bash is also required."
[11:18:23] <johnbender> lol
[11:18:31] <johnbender> one "two" many others

[11:33:30] <uGoMobi> :D
[11:34:25] <johnbender> uGoMobi: agcolom: we can point people at those things for PRs / Issues along with the template if we want
[11:34:31] <johnbender> they have anchors included by default
[11:34:43] <johnbender> eg https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile#pull-requests
[11:35:53] <uGoMobi> johnbender: nice, will refer to readme as much as possible
[11:36:21] <johnbender> yah and if we ever feel like we can't do that within the scope of the readme let me know and I'll sort it out
[11:36:28] <johnbender> that is, if it feels like it's not helpful
[11:36:31] <uGoMobi> when people see that as comment on many issues they might take a peek at readme first before even think about opening an new issue ;)
[11:36:39] <johnbender> yar
[11:36:48] <johnbender> that's why I put it at the top :D
[11:37:01] <uGoMobi> good thinking
[11:37:12] <agcolom> johnbender: yes, that's really good thanks a lot. I would also add something to say what we mean by browser on which they are experiencing the issue (browser but also device/os and versions). I think uGoMobi mentioned it also...
[11:37:33] <johnbender> agcolom: yah I just added in the /platforms
[11:37:36] <johnbender> feel free to alter it
[11:37:39] <uGoMobi> yes it now says browsers/platforms
[11:37:43] <johnbender> I'm not married to any of it
[11:38:42] <agcolom> ah yes, sorry I missed it...
[11:39:04] <johnbender> totally feel free to change it as much as you want
[11:39:21] <johnbender> I'm not territorial
[11:39:25] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:41:37] <agcolom> I like the addition of the link to markdown (that's something many are facing issues with when trying to put some code in the issue description)
[11:43:01] <agcolom> johnbender: I seem you remember that you implemented a tag to opt a section out of jquery mobile enhancement... Did I dream it? (I can't find it in the docs)
[11:44:38] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: I just sent you an email
[11:45:00] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Does not appear to be working on 83xx
[11:45:30] <agcolom> or is it data-enhance ="false" ? (in my memory it was something different, but sometimes my memory cannot be trusted ;-) )
[11:46:27] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: ok thanks, looking into it
[11:46:42] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi:  :(
[11:47:20] <agcolom> sorry above i meant I seem to remember, not I seem you remember
[11:47:34] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: I was hoping that was it.
[11:47:54] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: I am not totally surprised
[11:48:08] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: what is device width of the curve?
[11:50:33] <JasonDScott> uGoModi: 320 x 240 px 16-bit
[11:50:51] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: ok thanks
[11:51:31] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: it just depends on the device width on which grid the issue occurs
[11:52:05] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: I put the fix on grid-a (50/50) which fix Bold... 460px width if I am not mistaken
[11:52:38] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: will try same fix on grid-c and -d for curve... just adding margin-right -0.5px
[12:02:49] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Sounds good. Yes the bold was fixed. (480px but I dont think it matters) :)
[12:03:42] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: ah 480px :)  now checking other BB models that has been shipped with 5.0
[12:03:59] <uGoMobi> to see if there are more different screen widths

[12:05:52] <JasonDScott> :)
[12:06:33] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: looks like we have to check the Storm as well
[12:06:47] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: i will download a simulator for both
[12:07:06] <JasonDScott> I will try to track down a real storm aswell
[12:07:08] <uGoMobi> seems like simulator is accurate when it comes to wrapping or not
[12:07:21] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: even better!
[12:07:31] <JasonDScott> Glad the sim works

[12:27:47] <agcolom> uGoMobi??
[12:28:00] <agcolom> toddparker?
[12:28:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes Anne
[12:28:22] <agcolom> Hi Jasper, is the highlighting on collapsibles normal? (see http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-set.html)
[12:28:34] <agcolom> it wasn't there in 1.0.1
[12:28:41] <agcolom> it is in 1.1.0
[12:28:54] <agcolom> and in master... I thought it had been removed??
[12:29:15] <agcolom> (open or close collapsibles)
[12:29:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: errrr .... my fault again
[12:30:13] <uGoMobi> <<< going to hide
[12:30:15] <agcolom> ah...
[12:30:21] <agcolom> no, don't ;-)
[12:30:21] <uGoMobi> but after I fixed it
[12:30:25] <uGoMobi> ;-)
[12:30:36] <agcolom> I thought you had removed it...
[12:30:55] <uGoMobi> you remember the mini collapsibles that got margin?
[12:30:59] <agcolom> yes
[12:31:39] <uGoMobi> well i gave that another look and what I reverted to fix that was actually needed
[12:31:49] <agcolom> ok.
[12:32:24] <uGoMobi> so I looked at the cause of the margin again which was that collapsibles had "a" as selector instead of "ui-btn" what we use for all other anchors
[12:32:41] <agcolom> ok
[12:32:42] <uGoMobi> now i know why that had to be an "a" and not "ui-btn"
[12:32:48] <uGoMobi> pffff
[12:32:51] <agcolom> ah....
[12:33:14] <agcolom> not too bad to fix then ;-)
[12:33:27] <agcolom> (hopefully)
[12:33:37] <uGoMobi> nah, won't be much work
[12:33:44] <agcolom> good!
[12:34:00] <uGoMobi> but i keep fixing the issues i create by fixing something and reverting and...  and... ;)
[12:34:42] <agcolom> Yes, but that way you're getting to know every single line very well ;-)
[12:35:10] <uGoMobi> haha yes
[12:35:41] <uGoMobi> i actually hoped that i already did know it that well by now
[12:35:58] <uGoMobi> anyway... will fix it
[12:36:09] <agcolom> great, thanks :-)
[12:38:08] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks for noticing the issue!
[12:38:22] <agcolom> no problem! You're welcome ;-)
[12:52:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: on second thought... the change i was refering to can't have caused this
[12:52:40] <uGoMobi> agcolom: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/content/content-collapsible-set.html looks pretty much the same as latest or do I miss something
[12:56:15] <agcolom> it does.
[12:56:29] <agcolom> yes, it looks identical!
[12:56:36] <uGoMobi> pfew :-)
[12:58:13] <agcolom> you're safe ;-)
[12:58:21] <uGoMobi> haha... yes :-)
[12:58:44] <uGoMobi> dont have to revert anything this time
[12:59:02] <uGoMobi> everything clickable is styled as button
[13:08:01] <Wilto> Got me some iOS 6, if anything needs a testin’.
[13:08:08] <Wilto> Also: hi guys. Long time no communicate-with.
[13:10:41] <uGoMobi> Wilto: hi Mat! welcome back at the surface ;-)
[13:11:00] <Wilto> I’m not fully above-ground yet, but I’ll be back in the regular rotation soon I’m sure.
[13:11:21] <uGoMobi> cool
[13:13:15] <Wilto> Mostly I am here to say: “DING DONG, THE ORIENTATIONCHANGE BUG IS DEAD.”
[13:14:23] <uGoMobi> hehe
[13:15:48] <agcolom> Hey Wilto!!!!
[13:16:09] <agcolom> That's good news!!!!
[13:16:26] <Wilto> Maps are crazy gorgeous, but that’s not quite so relevant to jQM.
[13:16:48] <uGoMobi> no more Google Maps right?
[13:16:58] <agcolom> well I get my students to always develop apps with maps, so that's good for me ;-)
[13:17:13] <agcolom> Ah you mean without google maps???
[13:17:39] <Wilto> “Apple Maps” now, yeah.
[13:17:54] <agcolom> yes, btw my colleague said he saw an apple map cyclist the other day in London!
[13:18:22] <uGoMobi> they use TomTom right?
[13:18:25] <agcolom> so that means I need to learn something new again!!!
[13:19:28] <uGoMobi> are they available as an API already?
[13:19:32] <agcolom> I'm not sure, that guy was taking video/pictures apparently... I didn't see him
[13:19:51] <johnbender> what a massive duplication of effort
[13:19:57] <agcolom> (for something like streetview)
[13:20:09] <johnbender> anyone know what their impetus was?
[13:20:20] <agcolom> yes, it is crazy! but I suppose they can afford it ;)
[13:21:04] <agcolom> fighting against google monopoly of maps??
[13:22:09] <agcolom> I heard they didn't want google maps on their devices anymore... Must big money involved...
[13:24:33] <johnbender> all the android lawsuits maybe
[13:24:34] <johnbender> well
[13:24:46] <agcolom> BTW, is there anyone else seeing the following on FF (I'm seeing it FF12 Mac)
[13:24:51] <johnbender> and the well known distaste for android that the late Mr. Jobs harbored
[13:25:59] <agcolom> yes, I go along with that too.
[13:26:02] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-icons.html
[13:27:56] <agcolom> at the bottom of this page, if you change the window width of the browser, you will see the elements of the control group do not move all at the same time
[13:31:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't see that on FF12/Win
[13:31:49] <agcolom> this does not happen with Safari
[13:31:59] <agcolom> Very strange! Is it just me and my screen????
[13:32:32] <uGoMobi> will check later when back on Linux
[13:32:43] <uGoMobi> maybe is platform issue
[13:32:59] <agcolom> And I think that's why sometimes the icons do not look centered for me as well
[13:33:16] <uGoMobi> I have seen that issue too
[13:33:30] <uGoMobi> on both Linux and Windows
[13:33:41] <agcolom> ah ok. That's something ;-)
[13:33:54] <uGoMobi> very random though
[13:34:03] <uGoMobi> mostly shifted more to the right
[13:34:09] <uGoMobi> but sometimes to the left
[13:35:57] <agcolom> yes. Looks like a one pixel shift. Maybe a rounding issue??
[13:36:10] <uGoMobi> yes i think so
[13:38:02] <uGoMobi> here is an example http://jsbin.com/obojav/4/
[13:38:44] <uGoMobi> I bookmarked some issue templates on which i saw the issue
[13:39:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: how does the middle icon on that test page look on Mac?
[13:40:00] <agcolom> Looks good actually
[13:40:42] <agcolom> They all look good on this example!
[13:41:29] <uGoMobi> haha
[13:41:39] <uGoMobi> the middle one looks odd here
[13:41:50] <uGoMobi> so it seems to be very random
[13:42:10] <uGoMobi> but still not happy with it :(
[13:49:54] <agcolom> yes, very strange!

[14:58:09] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: I adjusted the fix and BB Storm looks good now too. I wasn't able to test Curve because the page was not enhanced on the simulator. Maybe got got something to do with MDS simulator or some configuration. Also had trouble with non JQM sites.
