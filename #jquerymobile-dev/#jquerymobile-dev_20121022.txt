[02:21:48] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #117: FIXED in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/117/
[02:52:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, there is an option autodivider
[02:52:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: this JS Bin shows both ways you can set this option http://jsbin.com/enetay/17/edit
[03:06:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: in our current docs we are not consistent regarding how we document options...
[03:07:39] <uGoMobi> in most cases we show how to configure the default: $.mobile.[plugin].prototype.options.[option] = [value];
[03:09:01] <uGoMobi> in other cases we show how to pass an option when you call a plugin: $('.selector').[plugin]({ [option]: [value] });
[03:09:43] <uGoMobi> and sometimes we also mention that the option is exposed as data- attribute
[03:14:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I was wondering if this is going to be more consistent in the new API docs

[06:52:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! Re: 5186: Was the page not found error showing when the result should've been a popup, or was it showing only when the result should've been a dialog?
[06:53:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: only when it was a dialog.

[06:54:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[06:54:42] <arschmitz> however i need to try again because i think it may have been a coincidence and clickthrough based on a bug i was looking into this weekend that makes that particular interaction impossible
[06:55:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ :give me just a sec and ill check that
[06:55:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK, so the event was being passed through to a broken link below the select?
[06:55:34] <_|Nix|_> s/was being/may have been/
[06:55:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i "THINK" so im going to double check right now and ill let you know.
[06:56:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[06:56:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The
[06:56:40] <_|Nix|_> "compare mini and normal" link leads to a page-not-found.
[06:56:51] <_|Nix|_> Same with "mini-sized"
[06:57:14] <_|Nix|_> So, those are candidates. I'm going to try getting those to appear beneath the select.
[07:05:32] <arschmitz> ok it was clickthrough on the footer for sure
[07:06:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i removed the links and put just text and its completely unresponsive like i thought.
[07:06:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: So i would say that issue can be closed
[07:13:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[07:16:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup and i found a fix for the clickthough on the fixed headers and footers (after programatic scroll like in that case) this weekend too so hopefully that wont be a problem anymore soon.
[07:17:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Great!
[07:18:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just writing the unit tests now and going to try and get some of you more seasoned vets in here to take a look at it.
[07:18:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I've found a colleague who has an iPad2 running iOS6. He's gonna bring it into the office tomorrow, so I can hopefully fix that popup-reappearing-after-being-closed issue ...
[07:19:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Nice well iv got mine with me every day if you ever need me to do anything and that one isnt around. I have a 5.1 ipad 2 and a 6 ipad 2 here
[08:53:52] <Wilto> Alright. I’m back, and finally caught up after the Dev Summit.
[08:57:06] <Wilto> And I had a refrigerator thought about jQM, over the weekend.
[08:57:52] <Wilto> I got to wondering how often we’re using JavaScript for `calc()`-like styling.
[08:58:26] <Wilto> Like ( width: 100% - [ left padding ] - [ right padding ] ).
[08:59:38] <Wilto> I’m wondering whether we should try leaning on things like `box-sizing: border-box` or `vw`/`vh` where we can, and fall back to the current approach(es) otherwise.
[09:00:06] <Wilto> These are the things I think about, for funsies.
[09:00:09] <Wilto> Also: hi guys.
[09:01:35] <arschmitz> Wilto: i envy how much fun you had thinking about that this weekend.
[09:01:46] <Wilto> I don’t get out much, arschmitz.
[09:02:57] <arschmitz> Wilto: me either i spent most of my weekend working on what turned out to be issue #1 from the Device Bugs Project
[09:04:32] <Wilto> toddmparker, johnbender: See above.
[09:04:41] <Wilto> Not the part about me not going outside.
[09:04:45] <Wilto> Also that part, I guess.
[09:06:59] <toddmparker> think that box-sizing thing is a good idea
[09:09:06] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm not at all sure in what scenarios that applies so I don't have an opinion
[09:09:33] <arschmitz> wilto: toddmparker: johnbender: I'v got a fix i was hoping to get some more eyes on it addresses 3 issues plus a known issue in the docs and issue #1 on the device bugs project.
[09:10:01] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool
[09:10:06] <Wilto> I know I seent it.
[09:10:09] <arschmitz> ambitious i know but i was honestly only working on one specific issue
[09:10:40] <Wilto> toddmparker: Part of it is that I dunno how `box-sizing` plays out across all the devices.
[09:10:49] <arschmitz> wilto: toddmparker: johnbender: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/commit/3f5a5bba55584634d4224a62a33a1f9d4aba8ebb
[09:11:06] <Wilto> toddmparker: Might make for some cool research, if nothing else. coughfilamentlabpostcough
[09:19:43] <toddmparker> wilto - agreed
[09:20:37] <Wilto> I’m still generally uneasy about using it unqualified and saying “it’s cool; IE doesn’t support it but it has the same box model.” I’m sure there are a ton of places where it screws stuff up.
[09:20:38] <johnbender> arschmitz: taking a look now
[09:20:41] <johnbender> one comment so far
[09:20:46] <Wilto> I mean “has unique behaviors.”
[09:20:56] <Wilto> No I don’t; I meant “screws stuff up.”
[09:20:59] <toddmparker> arschmitz: cool, I just bounced that over to scottjehl__ too. He knows a lot about that bizness
[09:21:17] <arschmitz> cool
[09:21:39] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: toddmparker: scottjehl__: uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: NEW RULE!
[09:21:45] <johnbender> always comment setTimeouts
[09:21:45] <Wilto> oh no
[09:21:53] <Wilto> Oh, good catch.
[09:22:01] <toddmparker> http://paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/
[09:22:23] <Wilto> Rather than my usual implied “/* Something about stacks; who knows. */”
[09:22:25] <toddmparker> seems like a good thing to add when we do the markup and style re-factor. we'll probably de adjusting support then in bigger ways
[09:23:38] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah sorry i had some comments in there and switched computers and forgot to pull those over ill add them back if the fix is something that you all think is a good idea
[09:24:20] <johnbender> arschmitz: hah! no worries you'll note that no one does it
[09:24:24] <johnbender> hence the "new rule"
[09:24:29] <johnbender> which I've never done before lolololol
[09:25:03] <johnbender> arschmitz: the code looks really good
[09:25:10] <arschmitz> johbender: yeah i just want to get into good habits
[09:25:20] <johnbender> arschmitz: the only thing I have concerns about is performance
[09:25:36] <johnbender> seems like a lot of redraws from calculating scrollTop and such
[09:25:45] <johnbender> but if it's on scrollstop it's probably not too bad
[09:25:52] <arschmitz> johnbender: cool thank you im "pretty sure" it fixes a few android bugs too but im having issues with browserstack and dont have a physical one.
[09:25:55] <johnbender> we'll just have to test it out a bit
[09:26:39] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah of course i ran the unit tests and those at least all pass!
[09:28:09] <arschmitz> johnbender: one side effect of this is anytime the header or footer get out of position it will attempt to get them to update them selves and if not adjust them even if its for some other unrelated bug so it kinda works as a general purpose fall back
[09:29:16] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah _fixPosition will need some testing
[09:29:28] <arschmitz> and i found a lot of the click through issues are related to this too and it fixes them.
[09:29:32] <johnbender> traditionally we've had issues with the viewport valus on random platforms
[09:29:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can probably comment on which ones specifically
[09:29:58] <arschmitz> yeah i tested in some random android things on browserstack chrome firefox and ios5 and 6
[09:30:15] <johnbender> arschmitz: that's plenty for a first pass
[09:30:19] <arschmitz> but thats all i really have
[09:30:21] <johnbender> just need to live with it for a bit
[09:30:34] <johnbender> let the folks who logged the issue help too
[09:30:44] <arschmitz> so far _fixPosition only fires on ios6
[09:30:50] <johnbender> and then when we do a patch release for the bug fixes hopefully we'll get some eyes
[09:30:53] <arschmitz> when the keyboard pops
[09:31:37] <johnbender> arschmitz: sorry, either way _viewportOffset could be error prone (scrollTop, height, etc) but we'll have to see
[09:31:50] <johnbender> if it's working so far it's worth a try
[09:31:54] <johnbender> *could*
[09:31:57] <johnbender> it might be the silver bullet
[09:31:59] <johnbender> I have no idea
[09:32:11] <johnbender> I haven't worked with the height/position calc much in the browsers
[09:35:16] <arschmitz> yeah i can see where it would be potentially.
[09:36:36] <johnbender> arschmitz: if you want to address my comments I can merge it into a branch in the main repo so we get a branch preview for the people in those issues to try out
[09:36:54] <arschmitz> sure sounds good.
[09:37:06] <johnbender> arschmitz: I have a meeting at noon, so I'll be stepping out at about 11:15
[09:38:10] <arschmitz> johnbender: ill poke around that settimeout too to be honest its there from an earlier itteration and i meant to test to see if its still even needed this morning and spaced it
[09:41:38] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool!
[10:05:43] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[10:05:44] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Old build #53: FIXED in 1 hr 19 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/53/
[12:21:05] <toddmparker> arschmitz: If you need testing, hit me with a short URL and steps to test
[12:21:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What do you think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5207 ?
[12:21:44] <_|Nix|_> I guess he's in a meeting ...
[12:22:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin, uGoMobi: What about you guys? What do you think about ^?
[12:23:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It completely fixes #5137, and it should give us a place to put common form-element-related code.
[12:29:16] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: That looks good. I'll let gseguin or johnbender weigh in on the change though
[12:34:13] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: looks good to me
[12:36:38] <_|Nix|_> Great! Found a quirk though: The slider needs to override _reset, because it needs to call refresh( undefined, false, true ), instead of refresh(), otherwise it behaves in a really wonky fashion in FF. Try this: jsfiddle.net/FFP85/3/show and click reset repeatedly in FF(12) ... the value in the slider keeps changing.
[12:36:59] <_|Nix|_> Maybe it's fixed in later versions of FF. It doesn't happen in Chrome.
[12:37:45] <_|Nix|_> I fixed it: http://jsfiddle.net/FFP85/6/show/
[12:43:16] <toddmparker> Impressed you saw that bug. How often you you mash on the reset button :)
[12:44:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I must've been a tester in a previous life :)
[12:45:00] <arschmitz> toddmpaker: Thank you i got caught up with a problem at the real job so i havent had a chance to make the changes johnbender suggested once i do ill send a link.
[12:46:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the fix looks good!
[12:46:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was thinking maybe we should call the file widget.forms
[12:47:19] <uGoMobi> so it's clear it's an extension of widget.js
[12:49:02] <uGoMobi> s/widget.forms/widget.forms.js
[12:51:11] <uGoMobi> I see that UI is using the new WordPress site already... http://jqueryui.com/
[12:52:15] <uGoMobi> I thought we were going to wait with that until the new site for core is ready
[12:54:19] <uGoMobi> it even shows a wrong logo for Mobile if you click "all projects"
[12:55:03] <toddmparker> Yeah, those sites are messy
[12:55:10] <toddmparker> Guess they were ready so they launched
[12:55:21] <toddmparker> There is an issue re: the logo
[12:55:29] <toddmparker> I also asked them to change the green color
[13:38:02] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5188
[13:38:09] <Wilto> How YOU doin’, pull request?
[13:39:49] <Wilto> from the depths i summon forth jeff lembeck
[13:40:09] <Wilto> BEHOLD
[13:40:18] <jlembeck> Was looking through PRs and saw this - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5188
[13:40:45] <jlembeck> I was planning on doing something like this this week. What are the general opinions on on hooking TravisCI up?
[13:40:53] <Wilto> JUST AS PLANNED
[13:41:33] <Wilto> I defer to johnbender on most things that require “knowing things” or “thinking about stuff,” but based on what I do know I am *into it*.
[13:42:22] <johnbender> jlembeck: for jquery mobile?
[13:42:35] <jlembeck> yes.
[13:43:07] <johnbender> jlembeck: we can, I just don't see the point aside from getting the badge which I don't think anyone cares that much about
[13:43:13] <johnbender> we have a ci server setup and running
[13:43:21] <johnbender> and some subset of our tests will always have to run on it
[13:43:24] <johnbender> (testswarm)
[13:43:28] <jlembeck> Ah.
[13:43:42] <johnbender> jlembeck: to be clear, Travis CI is the bees knees
[13:43:47] <jlembeck> If the Jenkins server will always be necessary, then there's not much of a point
[13:43:48] <toddmparker> but, we get a badge!
[13:43:49] <johnbender> we just have the infra already
[13:43:57] <Wilto> yaeh but like badges though
[13:43:59] <jlembeck> I was trying to avoid having to keep maintenace
[13:44:00] <johnbender> jlembeck: yah it seems that way
[13:44:08] <toddmparker> c'mon level up johnbender
[13:44:15] <johnbender> lol
[13:44:20] <toddmparker> BOSS LEVEL
[13:44:20] <Wilto> We really need more gamification™ up ins.
[13:44:25] <Wilto> OH SH
[13:44:31] <Wilto> brb; fighting todd
[13:44:47] <toddmparker> scottjehl__: was looking at _|Nix|_ 's new form stuff
[13:44:49] <toddmparker> looking good
[13:44:58] <toddmparker> would like you opinion on that too
[13:45:08] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5207
[13:45:15] <toddmparker> johnbender ^
[13:48:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: gseguin: commented on the PR
[13:49:06] <johnbender> toddmparker: commented
[13:53:44] <toddmparker> thanks
[13:54:21] <toddmparker> All good questions
[14:03:43] <toddmparker> have we really not had a commit in 5 days in master?
[14:03:58] <toddmparker> brb, making a whitespace change
[14:06:53] <arschmitz> Wilto: johnbender: was just hoping to get your thoughts on new comments on https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/commit/3f5a5bba55584634d4224a62a33a1f9d4aba8ebb might be a better way to go?
[14:13:00] <Wilto> johnbender: http://wil.to/_/goodjob.jpg
[14:13:33] <frequent> Wilto: thanks for the nav update. Having a look
[14:13:52] <Wilto> What’d I do?
[14:14:15] <frequent> update on nav refactor
[14:14:16] <gseguin> Wilto: just say: "you're welcome"
[14:14:22] <frequent> :-)
[14:14:23] <johnbender> frequent: it's just a start, but I think it forms a strong foundation especially for people who want to do custom routing
[14:14:24] <Wilto> MY WORK HERE IS DONE
[14:16:16] <frequent> johnbender: sorry. thx @johnbender! Sounds straightforward.
[14:16:53] <johnbender> frequent: I thought "straightforward" was a good place to start
[14:16:59] <frequent> sure is
[14:17:04] <johnbender> that should make the harder stuff easier
[14:17:25] <frequent> although I'm a little worried about having to adapt my custom patchwork navigation...
[14:17:28] <frequent> ;-)
[14:17:33] <johnbender> :(
[14:17:34] <johnbender> yah
[14:17:39] <johnbender> sorry that his has taken so long
[14:17:54] <frequent> ah. good things..
[14:17:57] <frequent> take time
[14:18:36] <Wilto> We’ll let it slide with a written warning, johnbender. FOR NOW.
[14:19:24] <Wilto> but yeah no are you kidding me you are refactoring navigation. I’d ballpark my first pass at ~2018, if it were me.
[14:20:11] <toddmparker> johnbender: that nav stuff seems very sensible, but I work in Illustrator
[14:20:14] <toddmparker> nice work
[14:23:39] <johnbender> toddmparker: thanks
[14:23:58] <johnbender> kinblas: scottjehl__ gseguin I'd love to get your feedback as well when you three have time
[14:24:28] <gseguin> Thursday is most likely the earliest I can deep dive into it
[14:24:57] <johnbender> gseguin: it's not super complex, but I'm not in a huge rush
[14:25:02] <johnbender> there's plenty of bug fixing to do
[14:25:08] <Wilto> johnbender: This looks great, man.
[14:37:22] <frequent> ok. if not for IE8 not liking ui-overlay-x on the body.... here is a cross device/browser startup image - http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/splashview/demo.html - who needs apple-touch-startup-images :-)
[14:38:18] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'm not sure I'm going to get to page containers
[14:38:40] <johnbender> getting what I have here built into navigation could take a bit
[14:38:43] <johnbender> and probably a lot of testing
[14:48:10] <toddmparker> i'd rather make what we have work better first
[14:49:56] <johnbender> toddmparker: just a matter of time and effort as they say :)
[15:21:42] <AlexSchmitz> Wilto: think you could take a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4762#issuecomment-9634326 i think it should just be closed
