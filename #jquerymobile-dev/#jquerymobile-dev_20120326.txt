[03:36:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl created transitions-sequential-simultaneous (+2 new commits): http://git.io/8MHWog
[03:36:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/transitions-sequential-simultaneous] wrapped and refactored portions of the default transitionHandler function to allow for sequential or simultaneous transitions. The default sequential transition handler for 1.1 should not change at all. Both types are defined as different transition handlers ($.mobile.transitionHandlers.simultaneous and $.mobile.transitionHandlers.sequential), though their logic is shared interna
[03:36:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/transitions-sequential-simultaneous] updated slide transition to use the simultaneous handler. - scottjehl
[08:22:46] <Wilto> jzaefferer: Updated that Gist with Scott’s link. Thanks for the heads-up, dude.
[09:06:02] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquery: jQuery Bowling Night in NoVa! Join us for a night of fun! http://t.co/dZqExdHN ★ http://bit.ly/H7r1Kb
[09:08:09] <gseguin> morning jQMobros!
[09:11:11] <Wilto> Whassup, bruh.
[09:25:55] <Wilto> Happy 500 issues to jQM!
[09:26:13] <Wilto> ♫ And many mooore— ♫ wait, no.
[09:35:35] <gseguin> lol
[09:40:26] <Wilto> Once we’ve ironed out the big issues in RC1, maybe that’s the best use of RC2 time—barring any incident, of course.
[09:40:35] <Wilto> Just power through as many of the small-fry as possible.
[11:04:26] <toddparker> 500 again?? i'm going home
[11:05:02] <toddparker> gseguin and/or johnbender - do you guys had time to review scott's branch for the sync animations?
[11:05:14] <toddparker> like to get your feedback today so scott can lock that in.
[11:08:48] <gseguin> toddparker: not today nor tomorrow :(
[11:15:10] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: We're looking at how to bring back the original slide transition w/o fade for 1.1 and are hoping to land this for RC2: http://t.co/PumZkrR5 ★ http://bit.ly/H9Z4wB
[11:15:49] <toddparker> ^^ I think this sync transition will make a subset of people happy, esp if they are going to a more app-like experience with short pages.
[11:16:25] <toddparker> hate to try and make such a big change at RC, but it will be more in the spirit of keeping things backwards compatible
[11:16:46] <toddparker> ok gseguin. maybe johnbender will have some time today...
[11:24:37] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: We've been listening to everyone's great feedback from 1.1RC1 and have been hard at work making a few changes I think you'll all like. ★ http://bit.ly/GTRANX
[11:26:12] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: In RC2, we added an optional polyfill for fixed headers in iOS4, working now on supporting the older slide transition style. Worth the wait! ★ http://bit.ly/GQNV8Z
[11:41:31] <nickel> toddparker: quick question for you
[11:41:39] <nickel> sorting out my irc proxy
[11:42:01] <Wilto> nickel: I got an IRCCloud.com invite kicking around, if you need one.
[11:45:05] <gseguin> Wilto: IRCCloud is too GUI for nickel
[11:45:47] <Wilto> ♫ Tooough guy. ♫
[11:59:36] <nickel> Wilto: newp
[11:59:42] <nickel> thanks though
[11:59:56] <nickel> gseguin: has captured my general feeling
[12:02:56] <nickel> one of the original reasons that I started working on jquery mobile is that the markup made it lynx compatible :x
[12:03:08] * nickel is joking
[13:17:31] <johnbender> ahh that's much better
[13:17:36] <johnbender> praise be to the gods of ssh tunneling
[13:18:05] <johnbender> toddparker: posted back to basecamp
[14:20:37] <Wilto> johnbender: You around?
[14:20:44] <Wilto> Got a question that sounds like your territory.
[14:23:36] <Wilto> Actually, eh. Answered my own question.
[14:59:45] <Wilto> gseguin: Okay, how ’bout you—still on the clock?

[23:34:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to transitions-sequential-simultaneous: http://git.io/mdeMMA
[23:34:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/transitions-sequential-simultaneous] changed default of minScrollBack to 250 - the value still claimed in the docs. This reverts @toddparker's change in commit a6dc847474cd43b10d85744c66bd1d9ccce1632a, as a higher number is needed when reintroducing simultaneous transitions - scottjehl
