[08:38:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Ping!
[08:53:24] <kborchers> hey guys, is code.jquery.com the only CDN hosting mobile?
[08:54:04] <gseguin> I thought we had it on microsoft's cdn as well, toddmparker_ ?
[08:55:22] <kborchers> gseguin: yes, it's on microsoft
[08:55:30] <kborchers> i just read further down the download page
[08:55:30] <kborchers> thanks
[08:55:38] <gseguin> you're welcome
[10:00:53] <gseguin> toddmparker_: is that meeting still happening
[10:00:56] <gseguin> ?
[10:05:42] <gseguin> johnbender: ping
[10:32:03] <toddparker> hi all
[10:32:07] <toddparker> johnbender: you around?
[10:32:24] <gseguin> hey toddparker, what's that cabal thing about?
[10:32:42] <toddparker> heh
[10:33:01] <toddparker> it's a code coordination between core, ui, mobile, etc.
[10:33:23] <toddparker> i'll usually have you or bender or scott on this next time
[10:33:38] <gseguin> oh ok, I don't have the call info
[10:33:46] <gseguin> I just have it on my calendar
[10:34:03] <toddparker> right, more of a heads up
[10:34:39] <uGoMobi> hi guys
[10:34:58] <toddparker> gseguin - how do we switch between jQ core versions in our test suite
[10:35:17] <toddparker> ui has a query param like this
[10:35:17] <gseguin> "?jquery=" in the url
[10:35:18] <toddparker> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/progressbar/progressbar.html?jquery=1.6
[10:35:35] <gseguin> same
[10:35:39] <toddparker> cool
[10:44:39] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker: I am yes
[10:44:40] <johnbender> what's up
[10:45:31] <gseguin> johnbender: I was going to inquire about the cabal meeting but Todd answered
[10:45:38] <johnbender> kewl
[10:46:50] <johnbender> gseguin: speaking of the param, I need to switch the default to just the jquery.js
[10:47:09] <johnbender> the test suite does an actual file swap on the ci to change the versions
[10:47:10] <gseguin> why?
[10:47:16] <johnbender> because of the way we handle push state disabling
[10:47:26] <gseguin> hmm ok
[10:47:29] <gseguin> works for me
[10:47:29] <johnbender> gseguin: it's lame
[10:47:40] <johnbender> gseguin: oh no, it works perfectly
[10:47:53] <johnbender> but if you go to the push state disabled tests it will strip the query params :
[10:47:56] <johnbender> :(
[10:48:10] <johnbender> it's just a redirect to keep things simple
[10:48:26] <gseguin> kk
[10:48:30] <johnbender> gseguin: it's ghetto
[10:48:32] <johnbender> super ghetto
[10:48:48] <johnbender> but I don't want to waste a ton of time since I'm going to start work on the test swarm shtuff
[10:53:07] <johnbender> gseguin: I still haven't solved that event ordering issue
[10:53:19] <johnbender> I have a feeling that's going to eat a ton of my day up :(

[11:02:43] <scottjehl> johnbender got a sec?
[11:03:08] <scottjehl> left you a comment here that shouldn't take but a second to answer https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4285
[11:03:09] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by uGoMobi (1w, 5d ago): Fixes #4185 - When leaving from a page contains nested listview, pageremove event does not fire
[11:08:28] <johnbender> scottjehl: commented
[11:08:30] <johnbender> you are correct!
[11:08:42] <scottjehl> hey thanks for doing that
[11:08:51] <scottjehl> you were asking someting of me yesterday as well...
[11:09:21] <johnbender> scottjehl: there are some css prs that could use some review in the backlog
[11:09:33] <johnbender> I need to deal with the build
[11:10:10] <scottjehl>  I noticed the code here matches that of other code found in navigation.js. I'm n
[11:10:26] <scottjehl> should we land this PR and then fix both?
[11:10:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: scottjehl: saw the comment on that pull
[11:10:52] <uGoMobi> scottjehl: i was about to ask how to deal with it :)
[11:10:59] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm sure that seems janky
[11:11:05] <johnbender> but its consistent with the rest of the library
[11:11:39] <uGoMobi> johnbender: not at all, i totally understand
[11:12:07] <scottjehl> uGoMobi btw SLOW DOWN dude I can not keep up :)
[11:12:19] <scottjehl> kidding... thanks so much for all this work
[11:12:39] <scottjehl> it's very thorough and well thought-out
[11:12:52] <uGoMobi> scottjehl: thanks!
[11:13:30] <uGoMobi> scottjehl: you are in asia right? are you surrounded by monks there?
[11:14:03] <scottjehl> I've seen a fair share of monks in the past 7 months, indeed.
[11:14:11] <johnbender> uGoMobi: seconded
[11:14:15] <johnbender> we appreciate the hard work
[11:14:29] <gseguin> thirded
[11:14:55] <uGoMobi> thanks guys
[11:17:58] <scottjehl> looks like kinblas committed that original code
[11:18:23] <kinblas> ??
[11:18:28] <scottjehl> hey!
[11:18:29] <uGoMobi> scottjehl: at first i thought it to do with remove with dependents
[11:20:08] <uGoMobi> scottjehl: but that could be done while using widget factory as well
[11:20:41] <scottjehl> kinblas https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/34fb7b2dc1b961ff0284f5b878ffefbe2a44ad51
[11:20:42] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by jblas (7m, 2w ago): Fixes #2537 - Add new pageremove event  - Modified the pagehide callback in $.mobile._bindPageRemove() so that it fires off a "pageremove" event. Callbacks can prevent the removal of the page by simply calling preventDefault() on the pagremove event object that is passed to their callback.
[11:20:55] <scottjehl> we're just talking about triggering that event through the widget factory is all
[11:21:33] <scottjehl> uGoMobi's PR mimics that line which tipped me off
[11:21:36] <scottjehl> comment here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4285

[11:21:50] <scottjehl> I think we should just land this fix and then edit both. Thoughts?
[11:22:12] <kinblas> scottjehl: ah ok
[11:24:25] <scottjehl> uGoMobi if I pull this in now, would you have time to adjust both event triggers after?

[11:26:15] <uGoMobi> scottjehl: sure I will look into it
[11:26:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: also if you have time test out the events :D
[11:26:51] <johnbender> that is, add tests to the listview suite
[11:26:52] <uGoMobi> he he
[11:27:12] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:27:37] <scottjehl> shouldn't take much to switch those at least.
[11:27:44] <scottjehl> i'll keep reviewing your prs
[11:28:10] <uGoMobi> johnbender: saw your comment on that other PR - never created tests before but I suppose I can manage
[11:28:26] <johnbender> uGoMobi: cargo cult your way through the first couple and feel free to ask questions
[11:28:47] <uGoMobi> johnbender: thanks, will do
[11:45:52] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Hey! When a link to another page is opened from a popup, that page appears immediately. I noticed in issue #4362 that sometimes, when you navigate back to that page, the popup outgoing transition is still visible.
[11:46:17] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Thus, I was thinking that we should implement a way to close a popup immediately, i.e., no outgoing transition.
[11:46:53] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The question is: do we use the immediate-close both when the user clicks "Back" ( closing all visible popups ) and when the page changes, or just when the page changes?
[11:47:17] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Doing the former would be easier, because it would not require a separate pagebeforechange handler.
[11:47:53] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Note that this issue is relevant whether we've got popup stacks or mutually exclusive popups.
[11:48:17] <johnbender> gseguin: quick question for you
[11:48:26] <gseguin> shoot
[11:48:36] <johnbender> we have an explicit dependency declared for 1.6.4 because it wasn't amd ready right?
[11:49:13] <gseguin> where is that explicit dependency?
[11:49:16] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[11:49:26] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm seeing jquery load twice on the test build
[11:49:30] <johnbender> one from the tag inserter
[11:49:34] <johnbender> and one from the requirejs
[11:49:55] <johnbender> the odd part is I don't have that problem locally
[11:49:55] <gseguin> that can happen if requirejs is loaded after jquery.tag.inserter
[11:49:59] <johnbender> kk
[11:50:27] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm, here it appears to be loaded before hand
[11:50:33] <toddparker> ok, off my call
[11:50:40] <toddparker> johnbender: talking to Jorge
[11:50:42] <gseguin> hmm
[11:50:45] <toddparker> sounds promising
[11:50:46] <johnbender> toddparker: yap
[11:50:54] <toddparker> whew
[11:51:01] <johnbender> gseguin: if nothing jumps out at you I'll just keep working
[11:51:09] <johnbender> don't want to pull you away
[11:51:17] <gseguin> johnbender: which file?
[11:51:26] <johnbender> gseguin: slider is the one I'm looking at
[11:51:36] * gseguin opens that file
[11:51:38] <johnbender> it works fine for me on master when it's not served from the test server
[11:51:41] <johnbender> gseguin: don't worry about it
[11:51:43] <johnbender> I'll take a look
[11:51:49] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ^
[11:52:07] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: good Q on the popups
[11:52:13] <gseguin> johnbender: so which branch?
[11:52:24] <toddparker> is it that heavy to close them onbeforechange?
[11:52:37] <toddparker> one less thing to remember to clean up later
[11:52:44] <toddparker> no animation, just close
[11:52:53] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: What about "Back"?
[11:53:02] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Keep the animation on "Back"?
[11:53:25] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: hashchange happens even when there's a pagebeforechange ...
[11:53:40] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Currently hashchange is responsible for removing all popups from the screen.
[11:53:49] <toddparker> i think that if i'm in a popup and click a linkt hat navigates me to the next page
[11:54:04] <gseguin> johnbender: I know!
[11:54:05] <toddparker> it should look like the popups stay open as the transition begins
[11:54:12] <toddparker> i never see them close
[11:54:14] <gseguin> it's because of your last change
[11:54:19] <toddparker> but if i hit back, they are all closed
[11:54:47] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: "they are all closed", yes, but how? With a transition, or Bam! - just as if you had hit refresh?
[11:54:56] <toddparker> bam
[11:54:56] <gseguin> if version is "" then I can't check the version and export the jquery amd module
[11:55:14] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK, so, if "Back" == bam!, then there's no complication.
[11:55:15] <gseguin> johnbender: does that make sense?
[11:55:23] <toddparker> think it would be bizarre to transition back, then have all the popups in a stack unwind in an animation
[11:55:34] <toddparker> good. i like no complications.
[11:56:00] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: But still ... not too sure. On Android, all people would see is "Bam!" because they do not click outside a popup - they hit "Back" ...
[11:56:01] <toddparker> just like you can't deep link to a dialog, you can't deep link to a popup so by rights they should be gone when i go back
[11:56:39] <toddparker> so if i open a popup and hit back, it should animate closed because i'm still on the same page
[11:56:51] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Aha! Now we're talking ...
[11:56:58] <toddparker> but if i open  popup, click a link to nav to page 2, then hit back, i should just see page 1
[11:57:27] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: You should - correct, and you will, but sometimes when you go back to page 1, you'll see the tail-end of the fadeout.
[11:57:40] <toddparker> fadeout of the popups
[11:57:41] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... or slideout, or flipout, or whatever transition.
[11:57:42] <toddparker> ?
[11:57:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah.
[11:58:01] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: It's a bug in the browser, I think, because the transition has technically completed.
[11:58:06] <toddparker> that's why i asked if we could close them once page 1 transitions out
[11:58:50] <toddparker> or is the issue that if you're on page2 and hit back, the url in the stack is page1#&ui-state=dialog
[11:58:51] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The current implementation is this: We always close all popups when there's a hashchange. A hashchange happens when you click "Back", or when you go to page 2.
[11:59:13] <toddparker> right
[11:59:42] <toddparker> why don't you build this with the BAM and we'll see if there are any visual artifacts
[11:59:44] <toddparker> might be fine
[12:00:08] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The modification would be this: When you click back, we close all popups by transitioning them out. When you go to another page, we dispose of them without the outgoing transition.
[12:00:26] <toddparker> in your scenario above, the popups on page 1 would close when you go to page 2 so they wouldn't animate closed when going back - already closed a long time ago
[12:00:43] <toddparker> right, makes sense
[12:01:05] <toddparker> we don't want to slow down the *page* transition at all by animating popups out anyway when switching pages
[12:01:08] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Exactly - "already closed a long time ago" - yet the browser, for some reason, still displays the tail end of the transition.
[12:01:16] <toddparker> huh, odd
[12:01:29] <toddparker> but removing the out transition on page changes should fix this, right?
[12:01:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah, but, of course, there is a real race condition, as illustrated in http://jsbin.com/omacox/200 ...
[12:02:26] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yes, it'll fix this, but it'll introduce additional complexity, because it's like, "ok, mister hashchange listener, don't worry about closing any popups, because I, mr pagebeforechange listener have already closed them."
[12:02:49] <toddparker> i see
[12:03:04] <toddparker> i don't see an issue on that jsbin in chrome anyway
[12:03:15] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Or worse, the hashchange listener has already started the closing animations, not knowing that a pagebeforechange is about to happen, and now we need to yank them off the screen mid-transition.
[12:04:43] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Odd, because I can clearly see the popup still on its way out - in fact, if I'm fast enough, the onto-the-screen animation hasn't even completed yet.
[12:04:56] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'll show you with a screencast.
[12:06:45] <toddparker> i can test other browsers, no worries
[12:07:20] <toddparker> @scottjehl @johnbender @gseguin - might want you guys to weigh in here with _|Nix|_ on how to best close these popups
[12:07:48] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/popup-transition-delay.avi
[12:08:27] <toddparker> bah. i'm missing a quicktime component
[12:08:30] <toddparker> it's ok
[12:08:39] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Quicktime? It's AVI ...
[12:09:18] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... with mp4 inside ...
[12:24:27] <uGoMobi> toddparker: what is the idea with the Valencia theme? it's not 1.1 proof
[12:30:43] <johnbender> gseguin: can we just add the jquery dep definition to the 1.6.4 file?
[12:30:53] <johnbender> gseguin: the only time we'll ever use that is for testing
[12:31:06] <johnbender> and that makes my life easier
[12:31:08] <johnbender> otherwise
[12:31:13] <johnbender> much chicanery will need to take place
[12:40:21] <johnbender> toddparker: I had the entry in my calendar for the "cabal" on the 17th :(

[12:54:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Just wanted to draw your attention to #4320, but you have already commented.
[12:55:07] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: BTW: What do you think about the popup stack implem?
[12:55:36] <_|Nix|_> And anyone else, for that matter?
[12:55:52] <_|Nix|_> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget-stack/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[12:55:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I haven't had a chance to think about your comment regarding the hash and history for complex page setup
[12:56:14] * johnbender is reading
[12:56:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP - this is more about the look-and-feel of the stacked popups.
[12:57:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: kk
[12:57:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Just want people clicking from popup to popup and tell me what they think ...
[12:57:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the only thought I recall was that I wasn't clear how people would be able to deep link to a page state with what you were suggesting
[12:58:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: They wouldn't be, so if we need that, my idea's gone.
[12:58:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm actually not sure that's more up to Todd and Scott honestly but that was my only useful input :D
[12:59:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I was thinking we could just track the leaves of the history tree in the hash as a "vector" where the locations match to containers on the page vertically
[12:59:51] <johnbender> since the document is defined top to bottom
[13:00:14] <johnbender> vector, array, whatever
[13:00:58] * _|Nix|_ is contemplating "the leaves of the history tree"
[13:01:05] <johnbender> depending on whether we allow for dynamic container addition
[13:05:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm thinking that doing things without the ability to deep link, but still in a rigorous manner would be a good stepping stone towards eventually allowing for deep-linking.
[13:07:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... because we would know how we need to store the history, and then we'd have a better idea how to map it to the way the browser actually handles history.
[13:08:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... but anyway ... back to my close-popups-abruptly-if-necessary ...
[13:17:23] * gseguin catches up
[13:18:22] <gseguin> johnbender: what we can do is if there is no ?jquery parameter then we insert jfquery.js

[13:22:44] <johnbender> gseguin: yah that's what I need it to do
[13:23:06] <johnbender> gseguin: that's what I did with the patch in cisetup
[13:23:12] <gseguin> I'll change jquery.tag.inserter.js
[13:23:21] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[13:23:37] <agcolom> johnbender gseguin: what's the latest on 1.1-stable? Is it all cherry-picked? (I'm not planning on doing any git stuff tonight! Blood vessels in my eye have burst yesterday and I think that means sleep early tonight!

[13:32:09] <gseguin> if that bug is targetted for 1.1.1
[13:32:29] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It doesn't have a milestone set at all - but I filed it myself, so I dunno ...
[13:33:41] <gseguin> it's your bug, you filed it, you fix it, you get to decide if it goes in 1.1.1 unless it depends on stuff introduced in 1.2
[13:33:59] <gseguin> s/fix/fixed/
[13:34:08] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK, but I don't wanna break anythong for 1.1.1 ...
[13:34:35] <_|Nix|_> I don't think it depends on anything introduced in 1.2 ...
[13:34:52] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I'll cherry-pick it - after all, we still have time to revert it ...
[13:35:16] <_|Nix|_> ... if it should turn out to be disastrous ( which I don't think is the case, since all the unit tests continue to pass ) ...
[13:35:42] <gseguin> yup

[14:02:25] <gseguin> johnbender: let me know how that works for you
[14:03:41] <johnbender> gseguin: testing
[14:05:25] <gseguin> I added a couple console.warn so we know what version of jQuery we're testing against
[14:06:42] <johnbender> gseguin: appears to be working brilliantly
[14:06:49] <johnbender> many thanks
[14:06:53] <gseguin> kewl
[14:07:22] <gseguin> you're welcome, though I feel dirty now

[14:07:48] <gseguin> hey regarding https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4136
[14:07:48] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4136 on jquery-mobile (irnc; 3w, 5d ago): Can not disable 'push state' plugin when jQM loaded via require.js
[14:08:23] <gseguin> I'm thinking of changing that IIFE into a .one( "mobileinit"
[14:08:32] <gseguin> what do you think?
[14:08:57] <gseguin> not even an IIFE
[14:09:16] <gseguin> it's a $( document ).ready
[14:09:21] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[14:09:49] <johnbender> gseguin: off the top of my head that should be fine
[14:10:06] <gseguin> I'll run the tests before pushing
[14:10:12] <johnbender> gseguin: though the timing was deliberate
[14:10:32] <johnbender> gseguin: you might want to find the commit that changed that to see if there are any clues as to why it was set up that way
[14:10:36] <johnbender> `git blame`
[14:21:55] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm getting consistent failures in line with what I'm seeing locally so far for master
[14:25:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/HaWhRg
[14:25:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] No ?jquery => inserts jquery.js - Ghislain Seguin
[14:35:29] <gseguin> oh you wanted it in 1.1-stable?
[14:36:07] <johnbender> gseguin: yah both test suites need that
[14:36:17] <johnbender> gseguin: will that cause problems?
[14:36:36] * gseguin checks
[14:37:48] <gseguin> johnbender: you wanna remove 1.7.2 from the list of versions to pick up locally
[14:37:58] <gseguin> that's it
[14:37:59] <johnbender> gseguin: no that's fine
[14:38:08] <johnbender> ah
[14:38:10] <johnbender> yah
[14:38:15] <johnbender> I'll do that right quick
[14:39:14] <johnbender> gseguin: also the console warnings might be an issue when we set up test swarm
[14:39:18] <johnbender> just need to remember
[14:39:43] <gseguin> oh really?
[14:40:02] <johnbender> gseguin: depends on what browsers we test with
[14:40:09] <gseguin> they happen before testswarminject is loaded
[14:40:53] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm yah that's right so it shouldn't affect the reporting
[14:41:24] <johnbender> gseguin: well except that where the define is necessary it won't run eh?
[14:42:32] <gseguin> johnbender: can you rephrase?

[14:42:49] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] 1.1 doesn't support 1.7.2 core - John Bender
[14:43:25] <johnbender> gseguin: console.log statements are executed before the define is called, so when 1.6.4 is loaded it won't satisfy the jquery dep if the browser doesn't like the console.log
[14:43:39] <johnbender> s/log/warn/
[14:43:45] <johnbender> right?
[14:43:49] <johnbender> I'm eyeballing again
[14:44:30] <gseguin> oh.. that! yeah might want to remove them then
[14:44:47] <johnbender> gseguin: I should be working on that soon so I'll take care of it when the time comes
[14:44:58] <gseguin> k
[14:47:49] <johnbender> now onto the page sections breakage
[14:55:44] <gseguin> that change in navaigation.pushstate breaks the tests :(
[14:56:04] <johnbender> gseguin: I figured that timing was important
[14:56:59] <gseguin> so I'm not quite sure what the point is to have an option we can't set ;)
[14:57:08] <johnbender> gseguin: fact
[14:57:14] <johnbender> well ...
[14:57:29] <johnbender> option you can't set when loading the library in an unsupported manner?
[14:57:36] <johnbender> or did I miss something
[14:58:12] <gseguin> hmm, no we actually claim to support being loaded as an AMD module
[14:58:25] <johnbender> gseguin: ah I misunderstood
[14:58:30] <johnbender> I thought he was loading everything using require
[14:58:50] <johnbender> but he's loading it as a monolithic export
[14:59:25] <gseguin> I think so
[15:00:03] <johnbender> what's our tactic for forcing load order these days
[15:00:38] <gseguin> add a dependency
[15:00:49] <johnbender> arg
[15:01:11] <johnbender> hmm
[15:04:47] <johnbender> gseguin: page.sections has button markup as a dependency but it never calls buttonMarkup
[15:05:01] <gseguin> heh
[15:05:12] <johnbender> and buttonMarkup's pagecreate binding has to fire after page sections delegate has run
[15:05:13] <gseguin> maybe it should be removed
[15:05:22] <johnbender> yah taking it out seems to solve the issue
[15:05:29] <johnbender> gseguin: but I wanted to double check with you
[15:05:42] <johnbender> gseguin: I also switched it page sections to a bind
[15:05:51] <johnbender> because delegated events go first
[15:11:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/cxk6mw
[15:11:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] move delegate to bind to fix broken page sections test which dependened on delegate bindings coming after regular bindings - John Bender
[15:16:40] <gseguin> johnbender: how about initing regardless of the option on document ready
[15:16:53] <gseguin> and binding on mobileinit only if enabled
[15:16:54] <gseguin> ?
[15:23:41] <johnbender> gseguin: let me look
[15:23:51] <gseguin> running the tests
[15:24:12] <gseguin> don't want to pull you away from what you're doing though
[15:24:13] <johnbender> gseguin: what's the issue?
[15:24:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm grinding on these tests
[15:24:27] <johnbender> so the build is running
[15:24:31] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4136
[15:24:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4136 on jquery-mobile (irnc; 3w, 5d ago): Can not disable 'push state' plugin when jQM loaded via require.js
[15:26:27] <johnbender> gseguin: so, it seems like we want the latest possible event domready or mobileinit?
[15:27:15] <johnbender> that way if we defines a mobileinit binding before jqm is loaded and that happens after domready
[15:27:17] <gseguin> does it, I would have thought the opposite
[15:27:49] <johnbender> well he wants to make sure his binding that alters the global setting is run before the check in the pushstate module
[15:28:34] <johnbender> in the issue he's saying, at least in my reading, that mobileinit is actually firing after dom ready
[15:28:48] <johnbender> so we just need to make sure the teh check fires afterward
[15:29:03] <johnbender> I just wasn't accounting for the fact that mobileinit would fire after dom ready
[15:29:10] <johnbender> I thought domready was the latest possible binding
[15:29:15] <johnbender> which it was before using require js
[15:29:21] <gseguin> mobileinit is fired in a dom ready handler
[15:30:09] <johnbender> ?
[15:30:14] <gseguin> so yeah it's domready then mobileinit
[15:30:33] <gseguin> tests failed btw
[15:30:40] <johnbender> gseguin: it doesn't fire on dom ready
[15:30:56] <gseguin> crap!
[15:30:59] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.init.js#L16
[15:31:22] <johnbender> but in this case it does fire after domready
[15:31:26] <johnbender> because of require js
[15:31:54] <gseguin> oh!
[15:31:59] <gseguin> yes you're right
[15:32:06] <johnbender> so we just need the latest of the two right?
[15:33:55] <gseguin> yes
[15:34:12] * gseguin checks the navigation tests
[15:34:53] <gseguin> AH! they're not using require.js hence they fail if we bind on mobileinit
[15:35:43] <johnbender> gseguin: does the deferred object provide "last possible binding" helper?
[15:35:50] <johnbender> I feel like we do this in a couple places
[15:36:00] <johnbender> and the code is fugly
[15:36:47] <gseguin> I don't know if there is a DeferredList in jQuery
[15:36:52] * gseguin goes check
[15:38:35] <gseguin> ah ah ! we're getting there
[15:38:40] <gseguin> jQuery.when()
[15:39:06] <gseguin> can take an array of Deferred objects
[15:39:22] * gseguin tries that
[15:43:09] <gseguin> johnbender: how about adding $.mobile.deferreds = { mobileinit, domready } ?
[15:44:38] <johnbender> gseguin: if there's value there I'm not quite sure what your intension is
[15:44:44] <johnbender> gseguin: also I thought when was just a binding
[15:44:54] * johnbender doesn't know that much about deferreds
[15:44:58] <johnbender> maybe I should just go look
[15:45:28] <gseguin> johnbender: it was just in case some other module needs that kind of binding too
[15:45:44] <gseguin> I can constraint the change to navigation for now though
[15:46:00] <johnbender> gseguin: ahh so in the case you just write some code to resolve the deferred when both have been fired
[15:46:15] <johnbender> gseguin: the general pattern is used in a a lot of places
[15:46:26] <johnbender> not the mobileinit domready specific issue
[15:46:38] <johnbender> just "there are two events that fire, we want that last of the two to be the binding we use"
[15:46:39] <gseguin> where else ?
[15:46:48] <johnbender> can't remember
[15:46:50] <johnbender> :(
[15:46:56] <gseguin> heh :)
[15:47:03] <johnbender> gseguin: in events maybe?
[15:47:05] <johnbender> let me look
[15:47:08] <gseguin> ok, let me try it out first
[15:47:23] <gseguin> then I'll make it work for everyone
[15:47:29] <johnbender> cool
[15:47:41] <gseguin> baby steps
[15:49:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/pbJfnA
[15:49:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] move delegate to bind to fix broken page sections test which dependened on delegate bindings coming after regular bindings - John Bender
[15:50:47] <gseguin> drum roll
[15:55:04] <gseguin> ah DAMMIT, TESTS!
[15:58:22] <gseguin> ok my bad misread the docs
[15:58:35] <gseguin> trying again with the right syntax
[16:01:35] <gseguin> yeeha!
[16:01:42] <gseguin> johnbender: that worked
[16:02:00] <gseguin> 	$.when( domreadyDeferred, mobileinitDeferred ).done( function() {
[16:02:00] <gseguin> 		console.warn( "got domready && mobileinit" );
[16:02:00] <gseguin> 		if( $.mobile.pushStateEnabled && $.support.pushState ){
[16:02:00] <gseguin> 			pushStateHandler.init();
[16:02:00] <gseguin> 		}
[16:02:00] <gseguin> 	});
[16:02:33] <gseguin> so now you're saying that some other modules could use that, right?
[16:03:00] <johnbender> gseguin: just sans the two deferreds
[16:03:49] <gseguin> uh?
[16:03:49] <johnbender> but you've answered my question about how to trigger something when two events have finished
[16:04:07] <johnbender> that's what I was curious about
[16:04:24] <gseguin> it's a clean way of writing it I think
[16:04:31] <johnbender> darn right it is
[16:05:21] <gseguin> so the question is do I make these deferred available in the $.mobile namespace
[16:05:42] <gseguin> for use by other module to use ?
[16:06:01] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't think it's necessary
[16:06:13] <johnbender> pretty sure we aren't doing this anywhere else with those events
[16:06:53] <gseguin> a'ite, polishing and commiting then
[16:07:00] <johnbender> gseguin: nice
[16:07:02] <johnbender> super duper nice
[16:07:10] <johnbender> gseguin: that should get cherry picked me thinks
[16:07:31] <gseguin> will do
[16:15:14] <gseguin> et voila!
[16:15:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/5HlFww
[16:15:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Call init when both mobileinit and domready have happened instead of just domready. - Ghislain Seguin
[16:28:35] <gseguin> looks like we need to do a pass to lint our files
[16:28:52] <johnbender> gseguin: you did a grunt lint :D
[16:29:03] <johnbender> gseguin: I cleaned up a fair amount of it but there's a lot of work to be done
[16:29:15] <gseguin> I did :)
[16:29:36] <gseguin> It doesn't seem to pickup the jquery global option
[16:30:10] <gseguin> oh! silly me
[16:30:14] <gseguin> ok I think I know
[16:30:47] <gseguin> alright, added $ as a global
[16:31:54] <johnbender> gseguin: we should do seperate targets for js/* and tests/*
[16:32:02] <johnbender> ah
[16:32:04] <johnbender> nevermind
[16:32:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/dAMSTg
[16:32:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added $ as a global - Ghislain Seguin
[16:32:14] <johnbender> we'd have to do a custom task
[16:32:43] <johnbender> the tests require a ton of globals which are bad to have for linting the main js files
[16:32:49] <johnbender> not a big deal but something todo
[16:36:23] <sabotage> are jQM theme roller development question appropriate here?
[16:36:34] <sabotage> if not, where?
[16:36:35] <johnbender> sabotage: direct them at tbenzige
[16:36:43] <sabotage> nod
[16:38:30] <sabotage> tbenzige: any plans for CSS scope option on generated themes?
[16:39:23] <tbenzige> sabotage: what do you mean?
[16:39:54] <sabotage> see jQ-UI theme-roller advanced settings option
[16:40:14] <sabotage> prefixes all entries with provided selector as "scope"
[16:40:37] <sabotage> IOW, I want the theme to apply to just one portion of the DOM
[16:41:02] <sabotage> or multiple themes loaded but applying only to "scoped" matches
[16:41:36] <sabotage> if no plans, is it just time/code, or is it already discussed and tossed?
[16:42:35] <tbenzige> well i think that would involve making some adjustments to the jQuery Mobile Core JS
[16:42:45] <tbenzige> because JQM has to be aware of these scoped classes
[16:42:57] <tbenzige> but it's definitely possible. no one's brought that up before now
[16:43:02] <sabotage> agreed... and I see the problem now
[16:43:20] <sabotage> TR just produces the theme, not the structure
[16:43:38] <tbenzige> right, and the JS applies the classes, so it has to be aware of any scoping
[16:43:44] <sabotage> so to enable scoped CSS, would have to generate both in scoped context
[16:43:44] <tbenzige> definitely a possibility
[16:43:51] <sabotage> cool
[16:43:54] <tbenzige> you might try filing a ticket on JQM's github
[16:44:14] <sabotage> so if I were to get it working, it would be of interest...
[16:44:24] <tbenzige> i had trouble with this too when first developing TR. because im using jquery UI and jquery Mobile on the same page
[16:44:30] <tbenzige> might want to try an iframe for now
[16:44:41] <tbenzige> to isolate
[16:44:48] <sabotage> yeah, exactly my problem
[16:45:05] <sabotage> I've manually scoped it all in a copied version of the files
[16:45:12] <sabotage> but that just SUXORS!
[16:45:17] <tbenzige> there is also talk of merging jquery mobile and jquery ui so that they can work better together
[16:45:35] <sabotage> I do the iframe thing for 2 cases, works fine
[16:45:52] <sabotage> but my current hackery can't be done in iframe
[16:46:09] <sabotage> and is "infecting" the jq-ui CSS :(
[16:46:31] <sabotage> would be nice to see them merge, but doesn't solve my problem today ;)
[16:47:34] <sabotage> for context, my problem is creating thumbnails of rendered iframe contents into an SVG <foreignobject> element
[16:47:54] <sabotage> it works, but only if the CSS is scoped
[16:49:53] <sabotage> if curious, pull the demo branch of the RIB repo and see commits/behavior of project thumbnail previews
[16:50:18] <sabotage> https://github.com/01org/rib
