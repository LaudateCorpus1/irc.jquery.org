[06:29:31] <uGoMobi_> frequent: cool
[06:29:43] <uGoMobi_> yeah, the icon sprite is the hard part
[06:30:08] <uGoMobi_> and we are going to use SVG or font icons
[06:30:49] <frequent> does this make a difference vs. current in CSS layout?
[06:31:12] <frequent> right now, the icon-sprite is one background layer
[06:31:19] <frequent> with url(sprite)
[06:31:39] <uGoMobi_> depends a bit what technique we are going to use for PNG fallback
[06:31:47] <frequent> mh.
[06:31:57] <frequent> so I best stop here :-D
[06:34:23] <frequent> uGoMobi_: I still have background-clip available to "crop" the iconsprite with content-box, padding-box, border-box. Have not found a way to tweak the button dimensions to fit any of the three. I will have a look at SVG/font-icons, too.
[06:35:09] <frequent> easiest solution would probably be to have the sprite go top>bottom with enough spacing for the button-height
[06:35:23] <frequent> so it will be cropped automatically by the button dims
[06:35:31] <uGoMobi_> that's tricky
[06:35:54] <uGoMobi_> we want things to be customizable as much as possible
[06:36:33] <uGoMobi_> I think we first need to work on new markup for buttons and decide what we are going to use for icons
[06:37:21] <uGoMobi_> probably more effective to fix input type button after that
[06:37:30] <frequent> true. first things first
[06:38:44] <uGoMobi_> but of course it's useful to already look into this because it might affect the choices we make
[06:40:00] <frequent> yes, i will continue to play around with it and see what else comes up.
[06:54:48] <toddmparker> Morning
[06:55:07] <uGoMobi_> morning toddmparker
[06:55:41] <toddmparker> Hey !
[06:55:50] <toddmparker> You're on a roll
[06:59:40] <frequent> morning toddmparker
[07:00:44] <toddmparker> hi frequent 
[07:00:53] <toddmparker> did anyone look at your PR yet?
[07:01:32] <frequent> not sure. I PR-ed late, but arschmitz wanted to check
[07:01:38] <frequent> today
[07:01:44] <toddmparker> ok
[07:01:52] <toddmparker> i'll follow up on that in a bit
[07:01:57] <arschmitz> Yeah have not looked yet but going to shortly
[07:02:04] <frequent> np.
[07:02:19] <frequent> I will wait with the 1.4 PR until 1.3.1 is out?
[07:02:29] <frequent> (nowhere to PR to anyway...)
[07:02:34] <arschmitz> frequent does not matter they are on different branches
[07:02:41] <frequent> ok.
[07:02:52] <arschmitz> no 1.3.1 pr should be for branch 1.3-stable
[07:02:59] <arschmitz> 1.4 pr should be for master
[07:03:12] <frequent> ok
[07:04:44] <toddmparker> wonder why GH is saying it can't be merged
[07:04:53] <arschmitz> frequent looks like there are some merge conflict in the 1.3.1 
[07:04:58] <toddmparker> but yeah, this PR should only land in 1.3-stable
[07:05:07] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ha ha timing 
[07:05:12] <frequent> true
[07:05:15] <toddmparker> hi arschmitz 
[07:05:39] <frequent> arschmitz: so, another PR on 1.3 stable?
[07:06:07] <arschmitz> frequent clone the 1.3-stable branch and do you pr for 1.3.1 on there
[07:10:43] <uGoMobi_> we could do that local so frequent doesn't need to create another PR
[07:11:03] <arschmitz> frequent: for 1.3.1 the event should be refresh not tableupdate 
[07:11:13] <arschmitz> since it is documented as refresh
[07:12:13] <toddmparker> right
[07:13:40] <frequent> oh. I like that idea :-)
[07:13:50] <arschmitz> same thing with method name
[07:13:59] <arschmitz> should be refresh not update
[07:14:40] <frequent> ok
[07:14:51] <arschmitz> other then that looks good
[07:15:18] <frequent> true...
[07:15:38] <toddmparker> great
[07:15:52] <arschmitz> yeah only other thing is it looks like you merged master
[07:16:03] <toddmparker> is the plan to have frequent ale a new PR or can we make some tweaks on top of this?
[07:16:04] <arschmitz> which has changes that cant go into 1.3.1
[07:16:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker: think it might be best to do new pr because it was done off master so includes unwanted changes and a lot of conflicts
[07:17:26] <frequent> arschmitz: so I clone 1.3 stable, add "refresh" and PR?
[07:17:42] <arschmitz> frequent: if you dont mind that would be great
[07:18:16] <frequent> well, practice makes perfect ;-)
[07:18:33] <toddmparker> thanks frequent 
[07:18:34] <arschmitz> yeah flow is a little different for maitnence release stuff
[07:18:53] <arschmitz> and yes big thanks frequent will be great to get these in since we documented them
[07:18:56] <toddmparker> I reached out to jhogervorst  this morning. he seems like he's been a good help in the tracker
[07:19:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: awesome
[07:19:36] <toddmparker> anyone else you think we should reach out to? 
[07:19:58] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: cool
[07:20:37] <toddmparker> mrextreme, dzenisevchK
[07:20:58] <uGoMobi_> not sure to be honest
[07:20:59] <toddmparker> stforek?
[07:21:13] <arschmitz> yeah im not sure either
[07:21:42] <arschmitz> i have noticed  jhogervorst being super active though
[07:22:51] <arschmitz> i need to get back to some triage soon lol things have just been crazy since baby was born and other stuff
[07:24:26] <toddmparker> arschmitz: totally understand
[07:27:34] <toddmparker> just keep eyes peeled for people who might be good contributors
[07:27:40] <arschmitz> sure
[07:27:41] <uGoMobi_> will do
[07:27:53] <toddmparker> people that just report issues and don't try to debug/triage are less useful
[07:28:15] <arschmitz> yeah people that can get in and help are much more usefull
[07:28:16] <uGoMobi_> jonathan seems to be a good one for on the team
[07:28:48] <uGoMobi_> good issue reports and also creates PR to fix them
[07:30:43] <uGoMobi_> brb
[07:53:43] <Moutaz> Hello world, I thought IRC was dead. Is anybody there? :D
[07:54:43] <arschmitz> Hi Moutaz
[07:55:57] <Moutaz> Hello arschmits, Todd asked me to join here. I unofficially was working on RTLing jQM to make it work from right to left (http://www.intlaqa.com/jquery-mobile-rtl/)
[07:56:23] <arschmitz> oh yeah Hi i think i remember some e-mails flying by about that
[07:57:38] <Moutaz> Great, what are you working on? I mean, how do you work together? any time? how often do you meet online.. etc?
[07:58:17] <arschmitz> we all work when independantly for the most part and all discussion takes place on this channel
[07:58:47] <arschmitz> we offically meet once a week in #jquery-meeting at 2pm EST on thursday
[08:01:26] <Moutaz> Great, do you know who works on the core stuff? I mean we might need to add something global to tell if a widget should go RTL or not.. etc
[08:01:37] <Moutaz> Or you 'all' work on the core stuff :) ?
[08:01:48] <arschmitz> do you mean by core stuff?
[08:03:41] <arschmitz> as far as a global RTL option that is something that would require discussion and would be best brought up in a weekly meeting probably
[08:05:10] <arschmitz> And we all pretty much work on everything in JQM some of us have our areas of expertise of course but in general there is not any seperation as to who works on what
[08:05:11] <Moutaz> OK, I was thinking about just letting it work in RTL if the <body> has dir='rtl' , instead of adding yet another attribute like data-direction or something
[08:07:17] <Moutaz> OK great, thank you very much Arschmitz, I will try to join the meeting tomorrow
[08:07:23] <arschmitz> sounds good
[08:07:32] <arschmitz> if you need anything im uasually around
[08:07:46] <Moutaz> Thank you :)
[08:07:56] <toddmparker> hi Moutaz 
[08:08:04] <arschmitz> in general there are people around from about 4am EST to 6pm EST
[08:08:16] <Moutaz> Hi Todd
[08:08:28] <arschmitz> though you can often find myself or other people here other times also
[08:08:30] <toddmparker> definitely join the meeting tomorrow
[08:08:56] <toddmparker> we're re-thinking our css for 1.4 and one thing i'd like to keep in mind is RTL support
[08:09:25] <toddmparker> seems like you just need to override a ton of styles but is there a more sane way to manage this?
[08:09:49] <arschmitz> Yeah i agree RTL support is important
[08:10:27] <toddmparker> it would be great if Moutaz was on the team and helping to keep the rtl css up to date for each release
[08:10:30] <Moutaz> Unfortunately I don't think there is a better way for overriding the styles or making a completely another CSS file. But we can automate that I guess
[08:10:45] <arschmitz> if it is just styles maybe we could just make an RTL style sheet scoped to a class on body
[08:10:53] <arschmitz> and make it optional in download builder
[08:11:01] <toddmparker> right now, do you override or have a modified theme css file?
[08:11:10] <toddmparker> arschmitz: right
[08:11:26] <Moutaz> right now I make a separate different CSS file
[08:11:29] <arschmitz> that way we dont bloat the css for people that dont need RTL support
[08:11:36] <Moutaz> I tried to override it but it was so big and hard
[08:11:59] <arschmitz> I think we could probably make it eaiser to override when rethinking css too
[08:12:40] <Moutaz> Arschmitz: I think that's a good way (making the <body dir="rtl"> or using a class name in it, then use it in the CSS)
[08:13:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think this approach would continue in the more modular setup we are wanting for 1.4 also
[08:14:45] <Moutaz> One note for anyone working in JS too, the script contains default values that should be changed depends on the direction (Like arrow-r and keyboard keys enum.. etc)
[08:16:48] <toddmparker> good call Moutaz 
[08:16:58] <toddmparker> is there a checklist of rtl considerations we should keep in mind?
[08:17:07] <toddmparker> hopping onto a quick call.brb
[08:17:27] <Moutaz> and swapping the back and forward icons.. etc
[08:17:44] <arschmitz> Moutaz ahh good call some of that could still probably be handled with css
[08:17:58] <arschmitz> but you are right there may need to be some js
[08:18:17] <uGoMobi_> back
[08:18:27] <arschmitz> we are rethinking a lot of the markup and css for 1.4 though to rely less on JS for display
[08:18:36] <arschmitz> so hopefully this will help with that
[08:19:08] <Moutaz> Yes it could be handled in CSS but when a user makes data-rel="back" or something the wrong icon will appear, it is better to be handled in JS
[08:20:13] <Moutaz> Anyway I will make a list of considerations and email it to Todd
[08:20:23] <Moutaz> Do you have a global email or something like that?
[08:21:25] <uGoMobi_> Moutaz: you can mail toddmparker and he can post it on Basecamp
[08:21:28] <arschmitz> moutaz data-rel back could be handled with css i belive because we set the icon in css so we would just remap which icon is used with the rtl style scope
[08:21:31] <uGoMobi_> also ... hi
[08:21:49] <uGoMobi_> true arschmitz 
[08:22:28] <arschmitz> just like we are doing with rethinking widgets i think we should TRY to do pure css and only fall back to js where there is no other reasonable solution
[08:22:32] <Moutaz> hi uGoMobi_. hmmm arschmitz let me remember what is wrong with that... I think there was a problem when I made it that way.. 
[08:22:52] <arschmitz> Moutaz: we are completely redoing markup for 1.4 also though
[08:22:58] <uGoMobi_> .ui-icon-left, [dir="rtl"] .ui-icon-right { }
[08:23:05] <arschmitz> so just because its a problem now does not mean it will be 
[08:23:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: deff good to have you in on this discusson :)
[08:23:46] <uGoMobi_> and .ui-icon-right, [dir="rtl"] .ui-icon-left { } of course :)
[08:24:55] <uGoMobi_> but I it's not very nice if the class name doesn't match what you actually see on the screen
[08:25:04] <uGoMobi_> or at least not easy to work with
[08:25:09] <arschmitz> might be some places where we could make this a lot easier when rethinking things
[08:27:12] <Moutaz> Yes, I think I remembered what was wrong in that, it is when swaping stuff like icon-right and icon-left and arrow-r.. etc in CSS, if the user wants to explicity make a 'right' thing by code it will appear left and vice versa. You know what I mean, right is still right in RTL and left is still left and when swapping them in CSS it may work nicely when using the default markup but when the user explicity types (data-rel=back
[08:27:36] <Moutaz> he won't get what he expects, he have to write 'forward' to get a 'back' thing, you know
[08:31:06] <uGoMobi_> Moutaz: do you use SASS or LESS?
[08:31:32] <Moutaz> I don't use them, so anything you use will be OK
[08:31:51] <uGoMobi_> another thing we are thinking about was using a pre-processor
[08:32:17] <uGoMobi_> maybe that would make it easier to maintain both LTR and RTL
[08:32:43] <uGoMobi_> we can use variables in there
[08:33:16] <Moutaz> I think SASS or LESS would help greatly in that, I thought you already use them, but when I downloaded the project I found it pure CSS
[08:35:12] <Moutaz> BTW, I am a server-side guy (ASP.NET/C#), I am not so good in JS and CSS :D
[08:36:56] <arschmitz> now problem any help is appreciated
[08:37:01] <arschmitz> no*
[08:38:50] <Moutaz> Thank you :), nice to you meet you guys
[08:39:46] <uGoMobi_> thanks Moutaz, nice to meet you too

[08:59:31] <uGoMobi> but doesn't it return 0 instead of ""
[08:59:49] <gseguin> it's a string 
[09:00:00] <gseguin> it could pottentially be empty
[09:00:06] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:01:11] <uGoMobi> ok, we can leave it in to be sure
[09:01:37] <arschmitz> actually no it does return 0
[09:01:45] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/arediv/1/edit
[09:02:06] <arschmitz> not NAN
[09:02:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so should be safe to remove it
[09:02:45] <gseguin> oh probably some jQuery niceness, isn't i?
[09:03:03] <arschmitz> yeah because .css returns 0px
[09:03:17] <arschmitz> wich gits parsed to just 0 by parseint
[09:03:43] <gseguin> gotta run catch my bus, catch you guys in a bit
[09:03:50] <arschmitz> later gseguin
[09:03:54] <uGoMobi> later gseguin
[09:04:25] <uGoMobi> yeah .css() takes care of this... we can remove it
[09:04:30] <arschmitz> yup
[09:05:02] <arschmitz> good to think of / check that first though to be sure

[09:34:01] <uGoMobi> FYI - that fix ^^ has been cherry-picked into 1.3-stable but jqmobilecommit is on coffee break or something
[09:35:32] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I've got some internal stuff to hack on then I'll take a look at the panels this afternoon hopefullyu
[09:35:57] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, no problem
[09:47:42] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Palestinian opened issue #5850: Changing "Collapsible" Theme Dynamically  02http://git.io/5f6HWA
[09:51:01] <toddmparker> ok, back now
[09:51:57] <arschmitz> johnbender: do you know if in your transitions refactor you refrence .defualt anywhere else besides handlers?
[09:52:16] <johnbender> arschmitz: let me check
[09:52:29] <arschmitz> if so it would break things
[09:53:15] <toddmparker> back
[09:53:19] <johnbender> arschmitz: I just did a reconcile on master and it looks like your change isn't in there
[09:53:24] <johnbender> there's still a dot ref to it
[09:53:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: double checking
[09:53:47] <arschmitz> hmm on github its there
[09:54:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: ah sorry, typed the branch in wrong (I have fetch/rebase alias)
[09:54:49] <arschmitz> no problem
[09:54:55] <arschmitz> and i cant see it anywhere else
[09:54:57] <johnbender> arschmitz: according to ack there isn't a .default ref
[09:55:07] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah it must be something else
[09:55:21] <johnbender> arschmitz: I didn't know the panels used the transition handlers let me take a look at the code
[09:55:24] <arschmitz> yeah just figured best to rule out the obvious first :)
[09:56:19] <johnbender> arschmitz: the commits from that branch are pretty fine grained it should be pretty easy to bisect to find the problem if it came from the transition branch
[09:56:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: that was my next step
[09:56:47] <arschmitz> yeah im not convinced its from that branch
[09:57:01] <johnbender> arschmitz: either way a bisect might be nice
[09:57:06] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[09:57:16] <johnbender> arschmitz: or just a quick glance at git log -p for the panels file
[09:57:19] <arschmitz> thats generally how i handle things like this
[09:57:29] <arschmitz> bisect that is
[09:57:31] <johnbender> can you do a bisect that only works for commits on a specific file
[09:57:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: bisect is win :)
[09:57:42] <arschmitz> yes
[09:57:46] <arschmitz> and yes
[09:57:48] <johnbender> wow
[09:58:14] <johnbender> that has obvious issues but if you're fairly confident that the problem originates with specific file it would save a lot of time
[09:58:27] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:58:34] <toddmparker> bisect is magic
[09:58:43] <johnbender> toddmparker: SCIENCE
[09:58:44] <arschmitz> there is a neat git gui tool for doing it in windows
[09:59:14] <toddmparker> i assume there is science but it just seems like a magical version of 20 questions
[09:59:30] <arschmitz> ha ha 
[10:00:22] <johnbender> toddmparker: arschmitz: in a different environment with a really fast and comprehensive test suite you can sometimes automate it
[10:00:29] <johnbender> (finding test failures that is)
[10:00:37] <johnbender> but that's mostly covered by CI
[10:00:49] <johnbender> that is, if you don't have CI, and you're not sure when a test started failing
[10:00:52] <johnbender> you can automate that process
[10:01:07] <arschmitz> johnbender yeah iv seen stuff for automating git biscet with a test suit its pretty awesome
[10:01:39] <arschmitz> never had a use before though because i use jenkins 
[10:03:46] <arschmitz> i guess it could be good for getting an old project up to speed though like something that did not previously have a test suit

[11:06:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks like you asked for too much ;) https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5849
[11:12:50] <toddmparker> closed.
[11:13:01] <toddmparker> one way to close an issue :p
[11:15:23] <toddmparker> arschmitz: i'd like to finish up the punch list for widget re-factoring and review it with scottgonzales later this week
[11:15:54] <arschmitz> sounds good 
[11:15:55] <toddmparker> thinking if we just had a list of things to look for, it would ensure that things get cleaned up consistently
[11:16:05] <toddmparker> mind taking a crack at that
[11:16:07] <arschmitz> yup
[11:16:13] <arschmitz> sure
[11:16:17] <toddmparker> we have a lot of ideas on the wiki
[11:16:19] <toddmparker> cool
[11:16:43] <arschmitz> fust fyi im out of town same time as you filamenteers
[11:16:55] <arschmitz> ill be in nyc
[11:21:37] <johnbender> TRUTH: http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif
[11:22:00] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:27:10] <toddmparker> i love that gif
[11:27:15] <toddmparker> so darn true
[11:27:36] <toddmparker> if you CS people had to deal with CSS, you'd quit the field
[12:05:09] <defaulto|away> didn't understand the gif animation. What does it say?
[12:13:49] <gseguin> so how are we doing for 1.3.1 ?
[12:14:05] <gseguin> what can I do to help?
[12:14:24] <gseguin> toddmparker: ^
[12:22:30] <uGoMobi> gseguin: maybe we can do something about some of the builder bugs
[12:22:46] <uGoMobi> like the rangeslider widget can't be selected on it's own
[12:23:03] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ok I'll look into that
[12:32:18] <uGoMobi> anyone with a iPhone 5 around?
[12:32:52] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I have an iPod touch 5
[12:32:58] <gseguin> what can I do for ya?
[12:33:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Wilto ^^
[12:34:37] <uGoMobi_> stupid IRCCloud is under attack again
[12:36:48] <gseguin> uGoMobi: why don't you use jQuery's ZNC ?
[12:37:40] <uGoMobi_> dunno... maybe I should set that up indeed
[12:38:03] <gseguin> gnarf can hook you up
[12:38:12] <uGoMobi_> yeah I know
[12:38:25] <gnarf> so can ryanneufeld
[12:38:30] <uGoMobi_> didn't ask yet
[12:39:25] <uGoMobi_> gnarf ryanneufeld : can you hook me up with ZNC please? :)
[12:39:43] <gnarf> I'm busy on a call atm, and I think ryanneufeld is in chaos mode
[12:40:06] <uGoMobi_> gnarf: ok, no hurry at all
[12:40:27] <uGoMobi_> will ask some other time
[12:40:30] <uGoMobi_> thanks
[12:44:48] <uGoMobi> gseguin: didn't see your reply until now, sorry
[12:45:06] <uGoMobi> it's about this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5764
[12:45:14] * gseguin looks
[12:45:43] <uGoMobi> I could see the problem on my iPad and it was gone after I committed that fix
[12:46:06] <uGoMobi> also didn't see it on iPhone 5 on browserstack anymore
[12:46:07] <gseguin> so http://jsbin.com/atarer/22 ?
[12:46:32] <uGoMobi> but the guy who reported the issue says he still can see the problem
[12:46:37] <uGoMobi> yeah 
[12:46:42] <uGoMobi> that's the test page
[12:48:35] <gseguin> uGoMobi: just clicking on a listview item ?
[12:48:55] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah
[12:49:07] <gseguin> I don't see a transition problem here
[12:49:57] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[12:50:04] <gseguin> you're welcome
[12:53:43] <uGoMobi> gseguin: is your iPod on iOS 6.0 or 6.1?
[12:59:13] <gseguin> uGoMobi: checking
[12:59:29] <gseguin> uGoMobi: 6.1
[12:59:43] <uGoMobi> thanks
[13:18:44] <toddmparker> gseguin and arschmitz - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder/issues/35#issuecomment-15859382
[13:18:57] <gseguin> yar 
[13:19:04] <gseguin> I started looking into it
[13:19:17] <gseguin> but of course something poped up at the office
[13:19:26] <toddmparker> ok, sorry. pasted then caught up.
[13:19:30] <gseguin> on it after I'm done dealing with it
[13:19:33] <toddmparker> the pope!
[13:19:44] <gseguin> popped
[13:19:54] <gseguin> however that is spelled
[13:19:56] <gseguin> :D
[13:20:27] <toddmparker> for 1.3.1, here are the issues: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=23&page=1&state=open
[13:20:45] <toddmparker> tho were you just testing #5764?
[13:21:07] <toddmparker> the only blockers are the table refresh methods
[13:22:24] <arschmitz> those are being worked on just need to get them polished up with frequent
[13:22:43] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yep
[13:22:49] <toddmparker> do you guys need help with that?
[13:23:39] <uGoMobi> I am looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5764 again
[13:24:06] <uGoMobi> the Chrome issue mostly because none of us can reproduce the Mobile Safari / webview issue anymore
[13:27:08] <toddmparker> odd
[13:29:06] <uGoMobi> the guy that reported the issue is talking about iPhone 5 / iOS 6.0
[13:29:50] <uGoMobi> if he really didn't update to 6.1 that might explain it
[13:31:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker: got a working punchlist
[13:47:51] <toddmparker> arschmitz: sweet
[13:48:11] <arschmitz> would like to run through it with you at some point before talking to scott
[13:48:18] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yeah, good call. but we shouldn't worry about older releases like that
[13:48:21] <arschmitz> also did he happen to mention when and how works for him
[13:48:24] <toddmparker> arschmitz: ok
[13:48:46] <toddmparker> be good to get opinions from uGoMobi, gseguin, johnbender, _|Nix|_ more than me
[13:49:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: did you test http://jsbin.com/atarer/22 on your iPhone?
[13:56:59] <johnbender> toddmparker: arschmitz: opinions on? Sorry I'm having trouble parsing from the preceding context
[13:57:46] <toddmparker> johnbender: i asked arschmitz to write up a punch list of things each widget should conform to so we're being consistent
[13:57:57] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: no, but will now
[13:57:58] <johnbender> arschmitz: oh man that would be gold
[13:58:28] <johnbender> arschmitz: gseguin: I would appreciate a quick look at the transitions/transition.js file when you guys get a chance
[13:58:42] <johnbender> there are a few things in there that could use some thought
[13:58:52] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: what should i be looking for?
[13:58:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: gseguin: off the top of my head the method names eg, doneIn
[13:59:08] <johnbender> arschmitz: gseguin: and the overridable methods
[13:59:16] <johnbender> which could be done as events or some such
[13:59:23] <gseguin> johnbender: will do once I'm done with repro the download builder issue I'm working on
[13:59:30] <johnbender> gseguin: cool thanks
[13:59:39] <johnbender> gseguin: arschmitz: just anything in general that looks odd or wrong
[14:00:02] <toddmparker> johnbender: be good to write up the punch list of standards, then run it by scottgonzalez to see if we missed anything
[14:00:02] <johnbender> gseguin: arschmitz: keep in mind that the child classes concurrent/serial also have an important impact on how the whole thing operates
[14:00:13] <johnbender> toddmparker: agree
[14:00:39] <arschmitz> johnbender: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit
[14:00:46] <arschmitz> its a work in progress
[14:01:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ^^
[14:01:20] <johnbender> arschmitz: access requested
[14:01:45] <arschmitz> johnbender: sorry try now
[14:02:45] <johnbender> arschmitz: looks great so far
[14:02:47] <toddmparker> arschmitz: cool
[14:02:50] <toddmparker> can we be editors?
[14:02:59] <arschmitz> i thought you were hold on
[14:03:25] <arschmitz> ok there
[14:03:30] <arschmitz> edit away
[14:04:02] <toddmparker> johnbender: maybe add some testing notes there too
[14:04:14] <toddmparker> arschmitz: looks great
[14:04:34] <toddmparker> any other perf stuff we would recommend? use this, not that, etc.
[14:04:50] <arschmitz> cool if anyone has anything to add feel free that was just my 10 min brainstorm
[14:05:05] <arschmitz> ill give some more thought tonight
[14:05:37] <arschmitz> toddmparker: did scott_gonzalez have any thoughts on when or how we wanted to go over this?
[14:06:56] <arschmitz> gseguin: if you want to take a look at that too would be great
[14:07:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the second page moves over the first page when navigating back https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5764#issuecomment-15794258
[14:08:14] <arschmitz> ok i gota run for a bit be back in about 45mins
[14:08:15] <toddmparker> arschmitz: he said he's available anytime
[14:08:23] <toddmparker> i suggested that friday might be a good time
[14:08:33] <arschmitz> ah would have to be first thing
[14:08:43] <arschmitz> im going to NYC friday
[14:08:58] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: right, just checking. the slide looks to be in sync on my phone. no overlapping
[14:09:23] <toddmparker> maybe tomorrow? you've gotten really far on this doc already
[14:09:33] <arschmitz> Yeah i could do tomorrow
[14:10:13] <toddmparker> arschmitz: cool, maybe after our meeting
[14:10:18] <gseguin> arschmitz: looks good
[14:10:29] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i also tested this saved to my home screen and it still looks ok
[14:10:34] <arschmitz> yeah that works good for me
[14:10:50] <arschmitz> gseguin awesome feel free to add anything else you can think of
[14:11:06] <toddmparker> iOS 6.1.3
[14:11:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok thanks
[14:11:33] <uGoMobi> same here
[14:11:38] <uGoMobi> on iPad
[14:11:45] <uGoMobi> I consider that fixed
[14:12:32] <toddmparker> testing my 5 device
[14:13:16] <toddmparker> it's a tiny bit out of sync sometimes but this doesn't seem like a big issue at all
[15:24:18] <gseguin> ok good thing I'm looking into the builder problems today because there is no way it works in 1.3.1 or master
[16:38:22] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15amirnathoo opened pull request #5851: Allow Cross Domain Request for Trigger.io apps (06master...06issue-5618)  02http://git.io/SowvuA
[18:03:09] <toddmparker> gseguin: Will the builder be in shape by Friday?
[23:21:34] <vick08> Hi. I hope someone can enlighten me to the following. I looked through the docs and the roadmap but do not see any plans to introduce either a horizontal version of the accordion widget or some kind of tabview. Any comments?
[23:23:00] <vick08> I've searched but do not see a way to turn the current "accordion" widget 90 degrees. data-type=horizontal doesn't seem to do anything on a collapsible-set.
[23:51:34] <vick08> If there are docs I am missing , let me know. I will be checking in. Thanks a lot guys!
