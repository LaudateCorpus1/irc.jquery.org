[05:07:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[05:07:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong!
[05:07:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! How come we no longer have a 1.2.0 milestone?
[05:08:05] <_|Nix|_> We have 1.1.2 and 1.2.1, but 1.2.0 is gone.
[05:08:11] <uGoMobi> if there is no issue with that milestone anymore it gets deleted
[05:08:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Really? Wow!
[05:08:21] <uGoMobi> but you can create it again
[05:08:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's bad!
[05:08:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I guess it's bad if you don't know that's how it works.
[05:08:48] <uGoMobi> no 1.2.0 issues anymore sounds good to me ;-)
[05:08:54] <uGoMobi> haha
[05:09:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, sure, but I didn't know that's how you can tell that there are no more 1.2.0 issues.
[05:09:24] <uGoMobi> I understand
[05:09:40] <uGoMobi> did you find a 1.2 issue?
[05:09:44] <_|Nix|_> Kinda sucks though. If an issue pops up, you have to create the milestone.
[05:09:53] <_|Nix|_> Then you fix it, the milestone is gone.
[05:10:04] <_|Nix|_> Then another issue pops up, you have to create the milestone again.
[05:10:12] <uGoMobi> yeah that's true
[05:10:33] <_|Nix|_> I guess that's one way github encourages us to write good code ;)
[05:11:18] <uGoMobi> at the other hand... there is no way to manually delete a milestone I think
[05:11:38] <uGoMobi> so the only way to delete old milestones it to make sure you fix all issues :)
[05:11:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Create milestone. Create issue. Assign milestone. Close issue.
[05:12:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But, yeah, you're right.
[05:12:15] <_|Nix|_> Imagine though if you accidentally mispel the name of the milestone.
[05:12:52] <uGoMobi> you can assign another milestone
[05:12:59] <_|Nix|_> :)
[05:13:14] <uGoMobi> after that the mispelled one isn't used anymore, so it will be deleted
[05:13:18] <uGoMobi> I think
[05:13:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: True.
[05:13:25] <uGoMobi> ;)
[05:14:00] <_|Nix|_> Well, actually, I think a milestone has a floating reference until you associate it with one issue.
[05:14:06] <uGoMobi> I also miss fireworks on my screen when last issue for a milestone is closed
[05:14:40] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, for sure. We should all get congratulatory emails.
[05:14:50] <uGoMobi> ah that's interesting
[05:15:21] <uGoMobi> so when you just created it but didn't use it yet it isn't deleted
[05:15:29] <_|Nix|_> Exactly.
[05:15:43] <_|Nix|_> But when you associate it with an issue, it loses its floating reference.
[05:16:04] <_|Nix|_> GTK widgets had the same system.
[05:16:19] <_|Nix|_> Well, they still have the same system.
[05:16:39] <_|Nix|_> I think. I haven't written any GTK code in over two years, I don't think.
[05:19:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the milestone is still there
[05:19:58] <uGoMobi> there is an open a closed tab in the milestone selector
[05:20:09] <uGoMobi> s/a/and/
[05:20:47] <uGoMobi> so it's not deleted but just removed from the list of open milestones
[05:22:47] <uGoMobi> so you can re-open it

[07:01:26] <toddmparker_> Good morning
[07:01:31] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: you here?
[07:01:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: good morning
[07:02:02] <toddmparker_> hey!
[07:02:24] <toddmparker_> nice work on the version. tested that on opera mini and it looks totally acceptable.like the way you did that
[07:02:37] <uGoMobi> thanks
[07:02:38] <toddmparker_> so i'v been testing this issue just now: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5072
[07:02:49] <toddmparker_> do you have a 4.1 device?
[07:03:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I like your triage work :)
[07:03:10] <toddmparker_> i had to keep it going
[07:03:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes I have JB installed now
[07:03:19] <toddmparker_> so torn about what to do with our new friend
[07:03:32] <toddmparker_> i like how you said to use the forums
[07:03:33] <uGoMobi> I tested transitions after I saw that issue
[07:03:37] <toddmparker_> oh, great
[07:03:48] <uGoMobi> didn't see any difference at all
[07:03:48] <toddmparker_> so can you open 1.1.1 and /test/ on it
[07:03:54] <toddmparker_> nav to the transitions page
[07:04:04] <toddmparker_> they do seem chunkier
[07:04:14] <toddmparker_> can't think of what we changed in that area
[07:05:19] <uGoMobi> what transition is best to compare?
[07:09:52] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I really don't see the difference
[07:10:05] <toddmparker_> what device are you on?
[07:10:15] <uGoMobi> Galaxy Nexus
[07:11:06] <toddmparker_> i have a nexus 7 which is the device they guy reported on
[07:11:18] <toddmparker_> the page flow transition is much worse
[07:11:31] <uGoMobi> the only change I can think of is that z-index trick for PG
[07:11:42] <toddmparker_> hmm, yeah
[07:11:54] <toddmparker_> what version you on?
[07:12:01] <toddmparker_> 4.1.1 over here
[07:12:03] <uGoMobi> and the check to disable transitions if more than 3x viewport height
[07:12:15] <uGoMobi> same version here
[07:12:18] <toddmparker_> right, that that's more of an opt out
[07:12:20] <toddmparker_> hrm
[07:12:24] <toddmparker_> let me check a phone
[07:16:05] <toddmparker_> can you dig up that PG z-index commit?
[07:16:12] <uGoMobi> sure
[07:16:30] <toddmparker_> btw - i've started searching closed feature requests to see if there are any we might want to add to the roadmap
[07:17:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/ff125b65e682ecd33888a6db1221ac441d258994
[07:18:04] <uGoMobi> ok great
[07:19:23] <uGoMobi> I will clean up the feature request wiki page after we are ready with the roadmap
[07:20:53] <toddmparker_> i sort of want to differentiate between feature requests we'll never do and the good ones that we want to add
[07:21:05] <toddmparker_> there are a ton i don't ever want to do
[07:21:16] <toddmparker_> phone is dead. charging.
[07:21:50] <uGoMobi> back to the transitions... if I test a transition 10 times there might be 1 or 2 times that it looks just a bit chunky, but that's also with 1.1.1
[07:24:34] <uGoMobi> about our new friend... I dunno what's best approach either
[07:25:01] <toddmparker_> i commented out those two line for PG and transitions are still bad
[07:25:16] <uGoMobi> hmm
[07:25:31] <toddmparker_> flow is a good test case. probably see 1/2 or less of the frames of 1.1
[07:25:55] <toddmparker_> you don't see a diff on flow?
[07:26:59] <uGoMobi> no not at all
[07:28:22] <toddmparker_> just got my galaxy nexus up and not major difference
[07:28:42] <toddmparker_> let me try the fire. it's terrible and now i wonder if it suffers the same. checking 1.1
[07:28:48] <uGoMobi> do you see a minor difference?
[07:30:14] <toddmparker_> too subtle to see
[07:31:07] <uGoMobi> I do see difference between native browser and Chrome
[07:31:17] <uGoMobi> turned out those are not the same on JB
[07:31:31] <toddmparker_> right, chrome is a bit better in 4.0
[07:31:41] <uGoMobi> native browser looks better than Chrome on 4.1
[07:31:56] <uGoMobi> the transitions that is
[07:32:16] <toddmparker_> restarting the kindle fire hd
[07:32:24] <toddmparker_> nav is totally broken
[07:32:36] <toddmparker_> hope that's just the os being flaky
[07:32:40] <toddmparker_> was working last week
[07:32:44] <uGoMobi> :(
[07:32:49] <toddmparker_> mondays
[07:32:59] <uGoMobi> is kindle browser based on webkit?
[07:33:42] <uGoMobi> or is it also a proxy like opera mini?
[07:34:04] <toddmparker_> webkit, but it's a hybrid proxy
[07:34:15] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:34:29] <toddmparker_> it can have the server do heavy lifting on various things - css, js, rendering
[07:34:39] <toddmparker_> but it changes per page
[07:34:51] <toddmparker_> original kindle didn't do much, standard webkit
[07:34:57] <toddmparker_> worried they are trying to do more
[07:35:35] <toddmparker_> doesn't support replaceState - URLs are ugly
[07:35:47] <toddmparker_> glad i re-started, working
[07:35:56] <uGoMobi> ok :)
[07:37:22] <toddmparker_> ok, so i can confirm that the fire is better on 1.1 too
[07:37:39] <toddmparker_> even with those PG lines commented out
[07:37:47] <toddmparker_> crap
[07:37:48] <uGoMobi> so on 7 inch screens the difference is visible
[07:37:52] <toddmparker_> yep
[07:38:03] <toddmparker_> fire is running 4.0 so it's not just JB
[07:38:12] <toddmparker_> shows how underpowered these are
[07:38:18] <toddmparker_> compared to a phone
[07:38:47] <uGoMobi> everything to keep them cheap
[07:39:07] <toddmparker_> seeing a double blink on the fire - page blanks out, flashes back, then transitions
[07:39:23] <toddmparker_> thought the fire was just bad but now i dunno
[07:39:32] <toddmparker_> blanks out even opening a popup
[07:39:53] <uGoMobi> that's bad
[07:41:19] <uGoMobi> I am thinking hard what could have caused this
[07:41:43] <uGoMobi> maybe we shoudn't just look at transitions
[07:41:53] <toddmparker_> exactly
[07:42:05] <uGoMobi> but any change that possibly could have affected performance
[07:42:08] <toddmparker_> page height, overflow, z-index
[07:42:25] <toddmparker_> ah, didn't you change the height recently?
[07:42:54] <uGoMobi> I thought that was before 1.1.1
[07:43:13] <uGoMobi> not sure though, would have to check
[07:43:49] <toddmparker_> 1.2 alpha is still not good
[07:43:58] <toddmparker_> so it must be an early change
[07:48:32] <toddmparker_> yep, alpha was already chunky
[07:48:35] <toddmparker_> hrm
[07:49:13] <toddmparker_> looking here uGoMobi - http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/08/01/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-2-0-alpha/#changelog
[07:49:32] <uGoMobi> ah good idea
[07:52:21] <uGoMobi> don't see anything suspicious the changelog
[07:52:31] <toddmparker_> me neither
[07:52:45] <uGoMobi> so we are looking for a commit that wasn't a fix
[07:52:54] <toddmparker_> did we change anything about the transition.js code?
[07:53:24] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/ff125b65e682ecd33888a6db1221ac441d258994/js/jquery.mobile.transition.js
[07:53:26] <toddmparker_> history
[07:54:03] <uGoMobi> that PG fix should have landed in 1.1.1 but it was accidently reverted
[07:54:30] <toddmparker_> 1.1.1 was july
[07:54:48] <toddmparker_> that doesn't seem to make a difference if i'm doing this right
[07:54:55] <toddmparker_> i just commented out those two lines...
[07:55:35] <uGoMobi> I also remember that when I first picked that PG commit there was a conflict because of a commit from Scott that wasn't picked
[07:55:39] <toddmparker_> oops. changes in master
[07:55:40] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/master/js/jquery.mobile.transition.js
[07:56:13] <toddmparker_> doesn't look like we touched this after 1.1.1
[07:56:33] <toddmparker_> funny that PG commit it listed, it wasn't applied, right?
[07:57:38] <uGoMobi> correct
[07:58:34] <uGoMobi> it was reverted when gseguin picked that max scroll height check for transitions
[07:58:46] <uGoMobi> I am looking at this commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/f164821cd7fa64ea582728f524a927a621402507
[07:58:58] <uGoMobi> checking if that was reverted too
[07:59:12] <uGoMobi> that is the commit from Scott I was talking about
[07:59:35] <toddmparker_> hoping it was this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7f38595fdb0c09e54c153e16491cadc9daa5d426
[07:59:37] <toddmparker_> nope
[08:00:17] <uGoMobi> nah that was just same code on different place
[08:02:33] <toddmparker_> swapped out transition. js locally with the 1.1-stable version, no difference
[08:03:41] <uGoMobi> It looks like this commit wasn't in 1.1.1 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/f164821cd7fa64ea582728f524a927a621402507
[08:04:45] <toddmparker_> lemme try that
[08:06:15] <uGoMobi> now I am sure it is not in 1.1.1, it has been reverted together with the PG fix
[08:07:57] <toddmparker_> so i dropped this 1.1 version in and no improvement
[08:07:58] <toddmparker_> https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/1.1-stable/js/jquery.mobile.transition.js
[08:08:06] <toddmparker_> is that the right thing to do?
[08:09:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: no, because I picked into 1.1-stable branch again after 1.1.1 release (for 1.1.2)
[08:10:23] <toddmparker_> i also hand-deleted those toPreClass lines from master and no improvement
[08:10:34] <toddmparker_> i think this might be css
[08:10:52] <toddmparker_> but i guess we need to dig up the 1.1.1 js file
[08:10:58] <toddmparker_> not the branch, right
[08:11:17] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:11:45] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/js/jquery.mobile-1.1.1.js
[08:12:55] <uGoMobi> search for reverseClass
[08:13:26] <toddmparker_> ok, i just dropped that into the transition page locally and still bad
[08:13:31] <toddmparker_> so it's not a JS thing
[08:13:37] <toddmparker_> something in CSS
[08:14:58] <toddmparker_> swapping in the 1.1.1 css makes things smooth with the master JS
[08:15:09] <toddmparker_> this won't be fun
[08:15:12] <toddmparker_> bisect?
[08:15:38] <Wilto> WHO BROKE TRANSITIONS
[08:15:45] <Wilto> I MEAN “HI.”
[08:15:52] <uGoMobi> that's no fun indeed
[08:15:52] <Wilto> NO I DON’T I MEAN “WHO BROKE TRANSITIONS∏
[08:16:09] <uGoMobi> because you have to test on the Nexus 7 or new Kindle
[08:17:56] <uGoMobi> I just mean... I can't help with that
[08:19:40] <uGoMobi> hi Wilto
[08:20:19] <toddmparker_> git bisect time
[08:21:42] <Wilto> DAMMIT, TRANSITIONS
[08:22:49] <Wilto> I’m gonna get this sorted, but in the meantime: everyone figure out someone to arbitrarily blame for this so I can be sufficiently angry.
[08:24:07] <uGoMobi> I think I committed most CSS changes so I am looking for a cave already ;)
[08:28:41] <gseguin> oh oops, DAMMIT, GSEGUIN
[08:29:01] <gseguin> did I revert something unintentionally?
[08:29:34] <Wilto> Okay, I need git help.
[08:31:58] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes, but you already knew about that and it is not the cause of the issue we are trying to resolve
[08:32:34] <gseguin> oh ok, good!
[08:32:35] <Wilto> Is anyone else running into “warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in…” issues lately?
[08:32:56] <gseguin> 'sup Wilto ?
[08:33:35] <uGoMobi> I vaguely remember I have seen that once before
[08:33:45] <uGoMobi> Wilto: ^^
[08:33:51] <gseguin> Wilto: shut down that windows workstation immediatly
[08:34:03] <toddmparker_> burn
[08:34:13] <Wilto> What the ’eff, man.
[08:34:21] <Wilto> This just started happening, out of seemingly nowhere.
[08:35:06] <gseguin> when you do a git commit
[08:35:07] <gseguin> ?
[08:35:25] <uGoMobi> it has to do with line endings, right?
[08:35:49] <gseguin> yes
[08:36:10] <Wilto> Incoming garbage commit; sorry guys.

[08:37:37] <uGoMobi> haha
[08:37:39] <Wilto> The day is still young.
[08:41:36] <Wilto> Alright, we be bisectin’.
[08:43:36] <Wilto> I blame kinblas; I dunno about you guys.
[08:43:44] <uGoMobi> +1
[08:44:09] <Wilto> Or core. Let’s blame core. For breaking our CSS.
[08:45:51] <toddmparker_> found the offending commit:

[08:47:44] <Wilto> Waaait for it…
[08:47:49] <Wilto> …DAMMIT, TODD.
[08:50:09] <toddmparker_> hrm
[08:50:18] <toddmparker_> sorry i broke the intertubes
[08:52:19] <Wilto> This is why git bisect is my jam dot com.
[08:53:31] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: shall I add the JQM version to the footer in the docs?
[08:55:47] <agcolom> Hi everyone :-)
[08:56:36] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[08:56:45] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[09:10:47] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: yes please
[09:10:50] <toddmparker_> hey agcolom
[09:10:59] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:11:14] <agcolom> toddmparker_: uGoMobi : is there any particular reason to have a fixed header for popups? (http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html)
[09:11:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, it was for testing
[09:11:42] <agcolom> ah ok :-)
[09:11:55] <agcolom> sorry, I had not noticed before ;-)
[09:12:15] <agcolom> toddmparker_: so I finished buttons this weekend, and I'm doing popups now...
[09:12:16] <uGoMobi> np
[09:12:42] <agcolom> Then I have busy evening with kids school again this week!
[09:13:51] <agcolom> Alex is going to secondary school next year... and the process here is rather stressful and complex! You visit as many schools as possible, you apply to up to six by 3rd week of october and you get the result in March!
[09:14:20] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: D000d! Sounds more stressful than applying for University ...
[09:14:32] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: seriously, it is!!!!!
[09:16:03] <agcolom> and thursday I have to combine visiting a school followed by a meeting at Alex's primary school to explain the process and give out the individual application forms!
[09:18:35] <toddmparker_> going to revert that change now
[09:18:50] <toddmparker_> agcolom: the fixed header shows more issues
[09:18:59] <toddmparker_> see the form popup
[09:19:08] <toddmparker_> you don't need to worry about that for the API docs

[09:20:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Transitions: Revert fbbcf9e16ed2978547f1460c66f533157714371d - was causing slow transitions on the Nexus 7. Fixes #5072. - toddparker
[09:23:46] <agcolom> toddmparker_: ok, thank you.
[09:24:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Does that bring back #4559?
[09:24:27] <toddmparker_> so happy we caught that
[09:24:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I mean your revert.
[09:25:23] <toddmparker_> it does I suppose
[09:25:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: So, we need to fix this some other way.
[09:25:49] <toddmparker_> but I'm not even sure what browsers support webkit-animation-fill-mode
[09:27:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: how goes it
[09:27:37] <johnbender> looks like there's at least one issue
[09:27:45] <johnbender> I'm working on my preso again today
[09:27:49] * johnbender is still sick :/
[09:28:13] <johnbender> it feels like someone stuffed razorblades down my throat
[09:28:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yikes!
[09:29:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Do you think we can squeeze in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4984 before 1.2.0?
[09:29:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: IOW: https://gist.github.com/3772691
[09:29:40] <johnbender> uh
[09:29:45] <johnbender> it's a private method for a reason
[09:30:12] <johnbender> what plugins make use of that?
[09:30:44] <toddmparker_> I'm going to add this note to the PhoneGap page:
[09:30:44] <toddmparker_> Try animation-fill-mode to reduce blinky transitions but beware that we're found that certain devices like the Nexus 7 run animations very slowly when this is added so this needs to be targeted carefully and tested thoroughly. To see how to add this to your CSS, see this commit.
[09:30:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: splitview ... multiple pageContainer objects and the like.
[09:31:08] <johnbender> *headdesk*
[09:31:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: we've
[09:31:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: when would they patch in with your solution? That is, when does the navready deferred get triggered
[09:31:34] <toddmparker_> i don't think that is critical enough to add ar RC
[09:31:37] <johnbender> anytime before dom ready?
[09:32:13] <agcolom> johnbender: Take Vitamin C and Zinc (fizzy tablet if they exist in the USA) everyday when you don't feel 100%. Really boosts your immune system.
[09:32:28] <johnbender> agcolom: will do
[09:32:31] * johnbender takes notes
[09:32:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We don't change when it's triggered. We merely assign the .done() call back to $.mobile._registerInternalEvents, and then we .done( function() { $.mobile._registerInternalEvents(); } );
[09:32:43] <johnbender> right
[09:32:48] <johnbender> when would they change the method
[09:32:55] <johnbender> and you can pass the method directly
[09:33:16] <johnbender> .done($.mobile._registerInternalEvents); (right?)
[09:33:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That doesn't work, because it takes the pointer and passes it to .done() too early.
[09:34:07] * johnbender thinks about object references for a momemnt
[09:34:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: correct
[09:34:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, with the anonymous function, the pointer is taken when the callback is called, not when .done() is called.
[09:34:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and they would just have to make the change before dom ready then I guess?
[09:35:09] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[09:35:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah I guess that's fine
[09:35:29] <johnbender> not a gigantic fan of doing late patches for people using internal functions
[09:35:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think so too. We're not really changing the logic.
[09:35:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: No doubt.
[09:35:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no but we're setting a precedent
[09:36:02] <johnbender> it's an implicity "yes you can complain right before a releas to get a change to a private thing that you are dependent on"

[09:36:07] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] PhoneGap docs: Added note about animation-fill-mode - toddparker
[09:36:13] <johnbender> s/implicity/implicit/
[09:36:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... as long as that change does not involve a logic change.
[09:36:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and you're right, it's a private function, so it's totally at our discretion.
[09:36:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: doesn't matter, changes cause issues
[09:36:47] <toddmparker_> well, technically we should touch the code at all once we hit RC unless a critical issue comes in
[09:36:48] <johnbender> this one might too
[09:36:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: what toddmparker_ said
[09:37:12] <toddmparker_> the change I just made was a biggie - it clobbered transitions on the most popular android tablet
[09:37:35] <toddmparker_> and i was just moving things back to the way they were at 1.1.1
[09:38:05] <toddmparker_> and just adding the code back into the docs as a "you might want to try this"
[09:38:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I know. I guess we might have to make this guy wait until 1.2.1 ...
[09:38:27] <toddmparker_> i'd rather not touch anything so we can go final
[09:38:28] <johnbender> I'm going to wag my finger a bit and then we can make a call
[09:39:04] <toddmparker_> it's too easy to add "one more thing" and blow a release. I've learned the hard way.
[09:39:32] <toddmparker_> unless we're updating docs, we're in code freeze on master IMHO
[09:39:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: people who want to use his plugin will have to stil with 1.1.1
[09:39:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK. You got it.
[09:39:48] * johnbender shrugs
[09:40:03] <_|Nix|_> I'll milestone that bug as 1.2.1 ...
[09:40:20] <_|Nix|_> Done.
[09:42:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, the other thing is the breaking-across-the-refresh-boundary. I've found that it's not much of a boundary. It seems the DOM and the whole js state is kept when you go back. So, not only does it look correct, it /is/ correct.
[09:42:40] <johnbender> refresh
[09:42:43] <johnbender> not a big deal
[09:42:44] <johnbender> deep link
[09:42:45] <johnbender> bigger deal
[09:42:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yes, but that works.
[09:43:01] <johnbender> I think we've piled up enough shit on that tower
[09:43:09] <johnbender> no more ui state refresh bug fixing
[09:43:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, yeah.
[09:43:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nono. deep link is fine.
[09:44:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Are you gonna be in DC? It'd be nice to talk some nav.
[09:44:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nope my wife has a trip to NYC that week
[09:44:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm should be knee deep in the refactor by then
[09:45:04] <johnbender> though I'm not sure it's going to go that deep
[09:45:17] <johnbender> on some level it might
[09:45:28] <johnbender> but it's mostly modularizing nave
[09:45:31] <johnbender> *nav
[09:46:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, so nothing fundamental, like the way we calculate the next hash?
[09:47:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm thinking about the page1 -> page2 -> page3 -> page1 -> page2 case, where you can't distinguish two instances of the same page in history.
[09:48:58] <toddmparker_> we're just going to sit for a few days and make sure RC2 was solid, then release this sucker
[09:53:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3654
[09:53:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah that's a known issue
[09:53:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: so there's at least one improvement we can make
[09:54:05] <johnbender> in the algo to determine forward or back
[09:54:17] <johnbender> right now it assumes forward if there are two pages with the same url in history
[09:54:20] <johnbender> which is silly
[09:54:23] <johnbender> most people want to go back
[09:54:28] <johnbender> rarely do people want to go forward
[09:54:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Correct me if I'm wrong: in order to truly fix this, we need to be able to distinguish all history entries from one another.
[09:54:50] <johnbender> so we have to start from the active entry in history and move toward the initial entry to find the page
[09:54:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right
[09:54:58] <johnbender> which is impossible
[09:55:01] <johnbender> well
[09:55:03] <johnbender> not impossible
[09:55:04] <johnbender> just silly

[09:55:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs: added JQM version info to footer. Fixes #3330 - Jasper de Groot
[09:55:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'll keep that one in the back of my head for the refactor
[09:55:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, great!
[09:56:04] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: for the docs logo, 550 x 156 is the magic number?
[09:56:18] <toddmparker_> I made it larger because I wasn't sure what size would ultimately look good
[09:56:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I can see probably two objects a singleton hsitory manager and history entries
[09:56:33] <johnbender> the manager would determine forward or back
[09:56:39] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: if you like the current size on the screen (275px width)... yes
[09:56:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was thinking maybe we should separate the URL calculation code into an object.
[09:57:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, later, if we come up with a brilliant scheme to construct new URLs from existing ones, we need only replace that object.
[09:57:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we'll see, that's tangled up into changePage and loadPage pretty badly
[09:57:15] <johnbender> this is a first pass
[09:57:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Not to mention popup.
[09:57:34] <toddmparker_> ok
[09:57:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yessir
[09:58:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I just doubled the 275 and made sure the height / 2 is a natural number too
[09:58:32] <toddmparker_> ok, pushing now
[09:58:33] <uGoMobi> is that how you call it? natural number?
[09:58:37] <uGoMobi> ok

[09:58:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] New jQM logo for docs that is retina-optimized - toddparker
[10:00:46] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi or robschmuecker - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5045#issuecomment-8810091
[10:00:55] <toddmparker_> might be a quick docs demo
[10:02:30] <uGoMobi> with or without number input the slider still doesn't use all available space
[10:02:53] <uGoMobi> I can give that a look
[10:03:09] <uGoMobi> maybe robschmuecker can work out a demo to show how to hide the number input
[10:04:49] <uGoMobi> I think hiding it might be quite simple because it uses the textinput widget
[10:05:19] <uGoMobi> so the number input has specific classes that you can set to display none
[10:07:57] <johnbender> uGoMobi: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number
[10:08:05] <johnbender> as opposed to something like a rational number
[10:08:05] <agcolom> OMG I love iframes!!!!!
[10:08:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi: since toddmparker_ is dividing by two if it's not a natural number it would be a rational number
[10:09:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: a positive rational number?
[10:09:20] <johnbender> I suppose you could do a negative width
[10:09:21] <uGoMobi> johnbender: thanks :)
[10:09:24] <johnbender> but I don't think you would
[10:09:27] <toddmparker_> irrational numbers are my friend
[10:09:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: seriously 2i don't get it :P
[10:09:46] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: we can just add a wrapper to the the range input
[10:09:54] <toddmparker_> and add some customs styles
[10:09:58] <uGoMobi> not sure if I am more confused before or after this
[10:10:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: :P
[10:10:08] <toddmparker_> hiding the input isn't a problem, you can tack on the accessible hidden class
[10:10:23] <toddmparker_> tho you might want to keep that so you actually know what value is selected
[10:10:48] <toddmparker_> i guess we could style away the input so it looks like feedback next to the label
[10:10:52] <toddmparker_> Price: $300
[10:11:31] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[10:12:05] <agcolom> in the API docs, I have iframes containing iframes containing jqm popus (maps and videos) and all works fine! That made my day! (yes, I am easily pleased ;-) )
[10:12:16] <uGoMobi> so it's about the input functionality and spinner
[10:12:44] <uGoMobi> I probably didn't read it carefully
[10:13:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom don't want to spoil your day but did you test that on Internet Explorer already? ;)
[10:14:51] <agcolom> uGoMobi: No ;-) I just concentrate on the content for the moment...
[10:15:16] <uGoMobi> you're right :)
[10:25:34] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: want any style changes to that version info in the docs footer?
[10:25:55] <uGoMobi> center version and copyright on small screens when they are on top of eachother maybe?
[10:25:56] <toddmparker_> what's it like now?
[10:26:05] <uGoMobi> different font color?
[10:26:21] <uGoMobi> you can see it on /test/
[10:26:38] <toddmparker_> Version 1.2.0 RC2       © 2012 jQuery Foundation and other contributors
[10:26:40] <toddmparker_> ah
[10:27:00] <toddmparker_> oh, i like
[10:27:24] <toddmparker_> maybe bold the version only at narrow width like you suggested
[10:27:25] <uGoMobi> I didn't add the word "version", but I can do that
[10:27:43] <toddmparker_> might be good to, yes
[10:27:45] <uGoMobi> want version left and copyright right?
[10:27:47] <toddmparker_> font size the same now?
[10:27:52] <toddmparker_> no, I like what you have
[10:28:05] <uGoMobi> yes, they are both exactly the same
[10:29:09] <uGoMobi> ok, will add "version" and make it bold on narrow screens

[10:54:19] <toddmparker_> you just wish you had thought of it

[10:54:50] <toddmparker_> (Born to Rokk)
[10:54:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: about the padding on that navbar page... that's not only on that page right?
[10:55:11] <toddmparker_> there seems to be a lot of space between the icon and text
[10:55:20] <toddmparker_> on the horizontal example
[10:57:33] <uGoMobi> now I am lost.. which example is the horizontal one?
[10:59:57] <uGoMobi> wait, I didn't notice the image you attached to your email
[11:04:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: what version of iOS it that?
[11:06:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: on Safari desktop with narrow screen and on Android JB I don't see that amount of space between icon and text
[11:10:21] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: do you see what I mean?
[11:10:28] <toddmparker_> iOS6
[11:10:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: on the image yes
[11:10:43] <toddmparker_> hmm
[11:11:08] <uGoMobi> going to check iOS5 on browserstack
[11:12:33] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:12:53] <toddmparker_> looking at this again, it looks like the icons are just positioned far left or right
[11:12:55] <toddmparker_> isee
[11:13:11] <toddmparker_> so it's not a code problem, it's a perception problem
[11:13:30] <toddmparker_> the text length made it look like icons were next to the text with certain spacing
[11:18:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I think it is an iOS6 issue
[11:20:07] <uGoMobi> on iOS5 there is less space between icon and text and more space between ellipsis and edge of the button
[11:21:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: SUCK IT IOS6 LOVERS

[13:26:30] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Does anyone remember why we ended up c-grading BB5 and iOS3 for some versions of core?
[13:27:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^
[13:27:28] <robschmuecker> Hi all,
[13:27:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes I do
[13:27:57] <robschmuecker> not aware of @_Nix_'s issue . . .
[13:28:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: one sec
[13:28:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Could you please remind me?
[13:29:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: getBoundingClientRect isn't supported by those browsers
[13:29:25] <robschmuecker> @uGoMobi, I think I can arrange the slider from issue #5045 to be 100% of what's left-over but a little worried that we're going to end up with some DIV-itis ...
[13:29:38] <uGoMobi> hi robschmuecker !
[13:29:59] <robschmuecker> Hi uGoMobi
[13:30:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/ scroll down to the RC1 release note
[13:30:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, but didn't core add a workaround in 1.8.2?
[13:30:50] <robschmuecker> it's been a holiday weekend here in SA so have been a little sparse!  Apologies !  Hi @_Nix_
[13:30:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, shouldn't we return to b-grade when core is 1.8.2?
[13:30:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: core returns {0,0} if it is not supported
[13:31:07] <uGoMobi> so they don't crash
[13:31:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: As of 1.8.2.
[13:31:16] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:31:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we must make sure that jQM + jQ-1.8.2 = b-grade on BB5 and iOS3.
[13:32:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we still run into issues... slider for exampe
[13:32:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, because it uses offset() and that's inaccurate.
[13:32:25] <uGoMobi> BB5 is already B-grade, iOS3 is A-grade
[13:32:38] <uGoMobi> B-grade is only about the Ajax nav
[13:32:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know.
[13:32:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: correct
[13:32:58] <uGoMobi> same goes for popup positioning
[13:33:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, I just tested, and jQM + jQ-1.8.2 = c-grade on BB5.
[13:33:27] <uGoMobi> yes that's correct
[13:33:50] <uGoMobi> B-grade with 1.7.x and C-grade with 1.8.x and up
[13:33:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If the reason for that is the slider positioning stuff, then BB5 can never be higher than c-grade ever again.
[13:34:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, understood.
[13:34:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I thought the fix that went into 1.8.2 was good enough to put BB5 back into b-grade, but I guess it's not, because of slider.
[13:34:31] <uGoMobi> we depend on core here
[13:35:16] <uGoMobi> I think the decision was also based on other performance issues with BB5
[13:35:38] <_|Nix|_> OK. Great!
[13:35:53] <uGoMobi> because otherwise we could just say... don't use the slider if you need to support BB5
[13:36:04] <_|Nix|_> Nono ... C-grade is best.
[13:36:10] <_|Nix|_> Clean.
[13:36:12] <uGoMobi> I think so too
[13:37:18] <uGoMobi> C-grade is cool... bit old school.... I think BB5 and iOS3 users will like it
[13:37:20] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:37:26] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:38:52] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: can't we just change the percentages we use for the slider?
[13:40:40] <robschmuecker> not really as currentlt 100% is 100% of the container . . .  which with the docs at least is going to push the input above the slider.  What we need is a fixed input and a fluid slider div.
[13:41:49] <robschmuecker> currently however there are no surrounding "container" DIV's for either the input or the slider that will work.
[13:42:47] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: I see
[13:42:47] <robschmuecker> the PE will need some work to make the slider automatically "grow" to fill all space unless overridden in the CSS.
[13:44:04] <robschmuecker> I will take a look at it if that's ok?  But not until the European/African morning!
[13:44:55] <uGoMobi> of course that's ok
[13:45:20] <uGoMobi> we don't commit any changes until after 1.2 is released
[13:45:27] <uGoMobi> so no rush
[13:45:33] <robschmuecker> . . . at least ! I've got a bit of catch-up to play as I still have some small commits to the Docs to do and I am starting to figure out the voodoo of Opera Mini's positioning !
[13:45:56] <uGoMobi> right
[13:46:04] <robschmuecker> ^---- RE popups
[13:46:54] <uGoMobi> about Opera Mini (and Opera Mobile too BTW)... looks like they report the wrong scroll height
[13:47:47] <uGoMobi> it's relative to the viewport instead of the document
[13:48:53] <robschmuecker> oh really?!  I've been finding very odd things being reported by Opera Mini at least.  For a Popup DIV that contains an image the JS position of the DIV seems out by a factor of 2 whereas other Popups report "normal"-ish values . . . it's a headache of sorts! :)
[13:49:08] <uGoMobi> if you open a popup that should be centered in the window and you scroll to the top to find your popup... then you see it being centered when you are at the top
[13:50:03] <uGoMobi> not sure if I explain it clear here
[13:50:16] <uGoMobi> but Voodoo is hard to explain anyway ;)
[13:50:31] <robschmuecker> Yes! :( We're starting to get around that somewhat though
[13:50:35] <robschmuecker> http://jsbin.com/orowiw/1/edit
[13:51:05] <robschmuecker> you can check this with the Opera Mini "sim" http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/mini/
[13:51:37] <robschmuecker> Perhaps look through my comments in the code first before looking at it with Mini or an Emulator.
[13:51:37] <uGoMobi> back to the slider... I don't think it has to be a problem if we add a wrapping div (we do the same for selects and checkbox/radio) but we have to think about backwards compatibility
[13:52:07] <robschmuecker> Yes true.  What currently happens when the slider degrades?
[13:52:15] <uGoMobi> people shouldn't have to rewrite their markup to make it work again
[13:52:26] <robschmuecker> no definately not!
[13:52:57] <robschmuecker> I guess it degrades to a pure number input right?>
[13:53:22] <uGoMobi> I dunno
[13:54:23] <uGoMobi> haven't seen a browser where it doesn't work
[13:54:32] <robschmuecker> don't stress about it for now - I think with  an additional wrapper DIV and some CSS we can arrange it to be fluid (100% of the remaining space) without ruining the BC.
[13:55:13] <uGoMobi> yeah should be posible, so let's give it a look later
[13:55:29] <robschmuecker> anyone who has specific CSS in place will be unaware of the "newer" div in any case and hence the inheritance of their stylesheets will take preference.
[13:57:05] <robschmuecker> I went and asked for some answers at the Opera Mini Dev channel and they weren't exactly "helpful" ! They claimed ignorance of a positioning issue and said I should enquire in the forum!
[13:57:09] <uGoMobi> that's the most difficult part... when we make small changes people report issues because their custom CSS doesn't work anymore
[13:57:31] <uGoMobi> hmm
[13:58:09] <uGoMobi> miketaylr usually hangs out here
[13:58:37] <robschmuecker> but that's another goose that we hope to cook at some stage! I think the slider issue is valid and relatively unobtrusive to "fix"
[13:58:39] <uGoMobi> he is from Opera so you can ask him
[14:00:51] <robschmuecker> ok thanks for the tip - will try and get some answers.  The problem with Opera Mini is the server-interpreted JS and DOM which at the best is slow to debug as you only have "alert", no console and a VM at best to work with.
[14:01:28] <uGoMobi> yeah I know
[14:01:42] <uGoMobi> but the same issue happens on Opera Mobile
[14:01:49] <uGoMobi> that one can be debugged
[14:01:56] <robschmuecker> @uGoMobi - i'm off for now and will hopefully catch you in the morning.
[14:02:13] <uGoMobi> ok good night robschmuecker
[14:02:14] <robschmuecker> yes OM can be at least debugged with DragonFly . . . :(
[14:02:36] <robschmuecker> good night uGoMobi
[14:02:43] <uGoMobi> thanks, see you tomorrow
[14:02:48] <robschmuecker> ditto.
[14:04:06] <toddmparker_> catching up...lots of conversation recently
[14:04:51] <toddmparker_> anyone need me?
[14:05:04] <toddmparker_> looks like things got squared away
[14:08:06] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: wingy asked me to say hi to you ;-)
[14:20:13] <uGoMobi> I am off... good night all!
[14:32:03] <toddmparker_> good night
[15:47:31] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: yt?
[15:47:43] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: yess
[15:47:46] <johnbender> -s
[15:47:54] <ryanneufeld> is your daughter feeling any better?
[15:48:16] <ryanneufeld> you had mentioned she was sick when we last spoke
[15:48:59] <ryanneufeld> also, johnbender with vagrant is there a way to force the order of operations in the vagrant file?
[15:49:55] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: she's fine, I on the other hand have come down with a sore throat :/
[15:50:06] <ryanneufeld> boournd
[15:50:09] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I think it's just the order of declaration
[15:50:10] <ryanneufeld> *boourns
[15:50:26] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: what do you mean specifically
[15:50:44] <ryanneufeld> well, I want to have an NFS share but the box I'm using doesn't have the right package installed
[15:50:52] <ryanneufeld> so it fails before it's even provisoned
[15:51:04] <ryanneufeld> if I could have it provision before doing the nfs share
[15:51:16] <ryanneufeld> that would give me an opportunity to have the package installed
[15:51:29] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I think that would require monkeying with the internals
[15:51:32] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: what I would do
[15:51:38] <johnbender> take the base box you are using
[15:51:41] <johnbender> fire one up
[15:51:43] <johnbender> setup nfs
[15:51:48] <johnbender> and then package it up
[15:51:49] <ryanneufeld> make a new box
[15:51:50] <johnbender> and reuse
[15:51:50] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:51:54] <johnbender> :)
[15:51:54] <ryanneufeld> I was thinking that
[15:51:59] <johnbender> super duper easyu
[15:51:59] <ryanneufeld> easy enough
[15:52:02] <johnbender> vagrant package
[15:55:09] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I just liked the idea of having a box from the cloud to use :P
[15:55:31] <ryanneufeld> though we're building a new uber server here, so might not be that abd
[16:02:32] <ryanneufeld> thanks johnbender, nice to bounce ideas
[16:02:41] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: np np
[16:02:47] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: happy that you're getting use out of it
[16:03:29] <ryanneufeld> I wish I had more time to play with it honestly. I think I'm gonna have to learn ruby so I can contrib more
[16:03:57] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: if you have questions about the internals just let me know
[16:04:24] <ryanneufeld> Oh, I will :p
[16:04:33] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: mitch is pr friendly but I'm pretty aware of what he considers plugin/core so I can help you out up front
[16:04:43] <johnbender> I think I'm the only other person with commit access :P
[16:04:53] <johnbender> it's his baby
[16:05:01] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I understand
