[22:45:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to jquery-version-selector: http://git.io/caZfPg
[22:45:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/jquery-version-selector] Moved the conditional define call within a document.write - Ghislain Seguin
[22:46:42] <gseguin> johnbender: did you say you wanted the docs to not use jquery.tag.inserter.js ?
[22:47:09] <johnbender> gseguin: yah on my branch I reverted that commit
[22:47:30] <johnbender> gseguin: I came up with a partial solution to the issue
[22:47:44] <gseguin> I just pushed something on my branch that solves the problem
[22:47:48] <johnbender> gseguin: nice
[22:47:49] <gseguin> one line change
[22:48:11] <johnbender> gseguin: did you get a chance to check out my approach?
[22:48:13] <gseguin> I think it's useful to have the doc using the tag insterter
[22:48:35] <gseguin> I was looking at it but it seems a little complex for waht we want to do
[22:48:48] <gseguin> and it requires loading the helper
[22:48:58] <gseguin> which wouldn't make sense in the docs
[22:49:01] <johnbender> gseguin: right
[22:49:14] <johnbender> as far as including it in the docs is concerned
[22:49:17] <johnbender> I would ask the rest of the team
[22:49:23] <johnbender> I only care about setting up the build
[22:49:24] <gseguin> oh yeah absolutely
[22:49:47] <gseguin> I just think it could be useful to quickly check bug reports
[22:50:23] <gseguin> I'll drop a basecamp post
[22:50:31] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[22:50:46] <gseguin> some tests are failing in 1.6.4
[22:50:53] <johnbender> gseguin: good
[22:50:55] <johnbender> well
[22:50:58] <johnbender> good that we did this
[22:51:00] <johnbender> and that's fine
[22:51:10] <johnbender> I'll try and set up the builds tomorrow
[22:52:08] <gseguin> do you want to land tests/ on master from that branch ?
[22:52:58] <gseguin> we'll merge the rest if the rest of the team think it's a good idea
[22:53:23] <johnbender> gseguin: how are you going to do that?
[22:53:33] <gseguin> cherry-pick ?
[22:55:19] <johnbender> gseguin: sounds good
[22:56:02] <johnbender> gseguin: I would include a note about replacing the jquery include with the version selector include
[22:56:10] <johnbender> gseguin: in the basecamp post that is
[22:56:15] <gseguin> yep
[22:57:23] <johnbender> it still feels jarring for me and I like having a default to fall back on, but I don't like people being able to easily opt out of supporting the query param
[23:04:58] <gseguin> johnbender: not sure I'm following
[23:05:06] <johnbender> gseguin: not worth following
[23:05:08] <johnbender> :D
[23:05:18] <gseguin> :)
[23:05:32] <johnbender> I'll let the rest of the team chime in and hopefully we'll have builds for each of the jquery version up and running shortly
[23:05:39] <gseguin> alright, I'll land tests
[23:05:45] <johnbender> hopefully it doesn't mean a whole lot of support
[23:07:09] <johnbender> gseguin: one thing that just occurred to me is that was could approach this from a scm/branch perspective
[23:07:25] <johnbender> hmm
[23:07:59] <johnbender> that would mean having builds for each of the combinations
[23:08:05] * johnbender discards that idea
[23:08:08] <gseguin> like have a 1.6.4 branch that mirrors master?
[23:08:12] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[23:08:26] <gseguin> what if you want to test with another version?
[23:08:45] <gseguin> I think the querystring offers flexibiliy
[23:08:53] <johnbender> gseguin: for local dev it certainly does
[23:09:09] <gseguin> though creating a branch with git is really not an issue
[23:09:34] <johnbender> gseguin: I doubt anyone is going to be testing with different versions
[23:09:41] <johnbender> and I think the bugs will be few and far between
[23:10:15] <johnbender> gseguin: just thinking of this in terms of a "Build change"
[23:10:38] <johnbender> and keeping said change localized to the builds
[23:11:30] <johnbender> gseguin: anyway, that's a pipe dream
[23:11:35] <johnbender> you have code that works
[23:12:06] <gseguin> ok, yeah I mean if you have a better alternative then we'll change it
[23:12:42] <gseguin> but for now that's not making me feel dirty and it works
[23:14:31] <johnbender> gseguin: working code > silly ideas :D
[23:18:15] <gseguin> the other great thing (I think AMD brought that) is that we can now run our tests with phantomjs
[23:18:34] <gseguin> they use to not run
[23:19:50] <johnbender> gseguin: that might be key to getting some coverage numbers too
[23:20:22] <johnbender> but there isn't much out there in terms of JS coverage tools
[23:20:32] <gseguin> have you played with jscoverage before?
[23:20:48] <gseguin> they require a build step
[23:20:48] <johnbender> yah
[23:20:52] <johnbender> yah
[23:23:49] <johnbender> gseguin: I guess I should try script cover again too now that we load individual files in the tests
[23:23:57] <johnbender> *script-cover
[23:24:24] <gseguin> don't know that one
[23:24:48] <gseguin> please do share your findings as I want to gain some knowledge in that area
[23:25:25] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm not sure what the state of running DOM code is with node but there is https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage
[23:25:30] <johnbender> that would be the best solution all around
[23:25:50] <johnbender> assuming it behaves like a normal code coverage library
[23:26:38] <gseguin> hmm I'll look at it
[23:26:53] * gseguin loves node
[23:27:20] <johnbender> it seems you are in a not-insignificant group with that sentiment
[23:27:38] <gseguin> heh
[23:27:45] <johnbender> s/with that sentiment/where that sentiment is concerned/
[23:27:53] <johnbender> alright
[23:27:57] <johnbender> I have to be up at 6:15
[23:28:00] <johnbender> I'm going to bed
[23:28:06] <gseguin> k
