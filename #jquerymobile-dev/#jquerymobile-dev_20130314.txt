[04:17:10] * _|Nix|_ writes this before he forgets why he pinged uGoMobi :)
[05:12:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey
[05:13:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure... maybe that splitview plugin
[05:17:37] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/asyraf9/jquerymobile-splitview/blob/master/src/jquery.mobile.splitview.js#L364
[05:20:17] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[05:20:39] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[05:21:09] <frequent> feel free to also pick my brain on splitview, I was working with it for a few months too
[05:22:29] <uGoMobi> frequent: cool
[05:22:47] <uGoMobi> frequent: I am not sure what _|Nix|_ is looking for
[05:23:13] <frequent> oh. I just logged in, I don't see anything older than 2mins
[05:24:03] <uGoMobi> 12:16 <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was just wondering if you knew of anyone (or any plugin) that overwrites $.mobile._handleHashChange ...
[05:25:33] <frequent> mh. give me a minute.
[05:38:04] <frequent> uGoMobi: sorry. I thought I had one plugin I was using, but it just disabled everything.
[05:38:39] <uGoMobi> frequent: ah ok, no problem
[05:38:44] <uGoMobi> thanks for looking
[06:37:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, frequent: Thanks!
[06:38:39] <_|Nix|_> It's about whether we can unexpose _handleHashChange, even as a private method. That is, we would remove it from $.mobile and restrict it to only be accessible from inside the jquery.mobile.navigation IIFE.
[06:39:10] <_|Nix|_> However, y-patch it.
[06:39:27] <_|Nix|_> Eeek ...
[06:39:38] <_|Nix|_> However, that would mean that people can no longer monkey-patch it.
[06:40:36] <frequent> I haven't really seen anyone do it except for splitview
[06:41:05] <_|Nix|_> frequent: OK, so splitview uses both _handleHashchange /and/ _registerInternalEvents, eh?
[06:41:19] <frequent> 1sec
[06:41:33] <frequent> can't check from work...
[06:41:42] <frequent> the version, I was working on
[06:41:51] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I guess if you wanna overwrite _registerInternalEvents, but you wanna write the replacement such that it also hooks up _handleHashChange, then you need access to _handleHashChange as well.
[06:42:07] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I guess we're better off not removing it.
[06:42:56] <_|Nix|_> frequent: However, if my PR goes through, _handleHashChange and _registerInternalEvents will move from $.mobile._handleHashChange to $.mobile._private.handleHashChange, or maybe even $.mobile._.handleHashChange ... we'll see.
[06:43:22] <frequent> Well one of the problems with splitview was that it overwrote/disabled pretty much "everything"
[06:43:36] <frequent> like no way to change Page A to Page B outside of panels
[07:33:25] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: thanks for keeping things moving. Been heads down all week after my vacation
[07:44:33] <mfranz> Hello, I have quick question about submitting form via ajax then on success using changePage to redirect to different div it seems to refresh the original div first then change to new div is there a way to prevent the original div refresh, I have tried googling a bunch, as well as return false at the end of the ajax call and async: false those haven't worked as expected
[08:21:11] <mfranz> Howdy there
[08:22:16] <mfranz> I have 3 div's <div id="a"> <div id="b"> <div id="c"> in one html doc.  After ajax submit on success i have $.mobile.changepage("c");  however on change it quickly shows div a and b before landing on c
[08:22:24] <mfranz> is there a way to prevent that
[08:23:54] <mfranz> this is submitted after a form submit runs through some php and returns and ID
[08:40:59] <mfranz> I have a better key work
[08:41:21] <mfranz> I am experience a flash of unstyled content during changepage after form submit via $.ajax on success 
[08:41:29] <mfranz> Is there something specific I am missing
[08:44:51] <_|Nix|_> mfranz: Can you create a small test case starting with http://jsbin.com/onibuc/edit ?
[08:45:08] <_|Nix|_> mfranz: ... to show us what you're trying to do ...

[12:03:44] <gseguin> toddmparker: that's `/mode #jquery-meeting +m` sorry
[12:35:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What do you think about $.mobile._private? There are currently 4 functions that could benefit from getting bundled under $.mobile._private - two of which need not be exposed at all, but are exposed because we're such nice guys.
[12:36:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: _ and private == redundant
[12:36:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What do you mean?
[12:37:04] <johnbender> seems like it should be $.mobile._somethingSemanticallyUseful or $.mobile.private
[12:37:05] <_|Nix|_> I meant s/_/private./g
[12:37:31] <_|Nix|_> OK, I see, you're right.
[12:37:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: $.mobile._* is fine for now
[12:37:59] <johnbender> it's not killing us
[12:38:02] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[12:38:02] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: up to you really
[12:38:11] <johnbender> I don't think anyone is going to complain
[12:38:15] <_|Nix|_> At least I tallied it up.
[12:40:58] <gseguin> and really it should be "protected" shouldn't it?
[12:41:48] <gseguin> toddmparker:  is the meeting over?
[12:42:04] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[12:42:17] <johnbender> gseguin: meh
[12:42:26] <johnbender> gseguin: it's not protected in the sense that most devs know
[12:42:35] <johnbender> gseguin: it's private like, "DONT USE IT"
[12:43:04] <johnbender> ie, we're out of an OOP context
[12:43:42] <gseguin> then lets call it "dontfuckingtouchit"
[12:44:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: We'd run into parental filter problems :)
[12:44:11] <johnbender> gseguin: that's one option, though I'm not a fan of french lololol
[12:44:22] <gseguin> :D
[12:44:34] <johnbender> I'm full of knee slappers today
[12:44:44] <gseguin> I can see that
[12:44:53] <gseguin> so is the meeting over?
[12:45:12] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think so.
[12:45:15] <gseguin> johnbender: wanna do that deploy thing?
[12:45:28] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: alright I'll turn off the lights
[12:45:36] <_|Nix|_> The meeting seems to have petered out ...
[12:46:20] <toddmparker> sorry, got distracted at the end there. dammit wilto
[12:46:28] <johnbender> gseguin: yes!
[12:46:30] <johnbender> gseguin: hangout?
[12:46:38] <gseguin> sure
[12:46:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender, gseguin, uGoMobi, arschmitz: Can you guys have a quick look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/0d4e839782c8574799b31ff222f80c683dccac88 ?
[12:47:23] <_|Nix|_> I'm pretty sure I can't strip off the query without first making sure that the destination URL is being accessed via GET.
[12:48:02] <_|Nix|_> Like, if the method is not GET, then the query has to stay because the new form data will be sent via a different mechanism.
[12:48:10] <_|Nix|_> It's for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5710
[12:49:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: looks good to me
[12:49:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool!
[12:49:40] <arschmitz> and yes if not get params should stay i think because they could be partof the destination path in a lot of mvc setups and such
[12:50:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep. I remember from PHP that there's $_GET and $_POST and they're separate ...
[12:50:10] <arschmitz> ex index.php?page=foo type deals
[12:50:24] <arschmitz> yup
[12:50:32] <_|Nix|_> OK. It's going in ...
[12:54:08] <_|Nix|_> I got the popup to work really well on its own. You can now open a popup here: http://jsperf.com/improve-popup :) Just run $( "#thePopup" ).popup( "open" );
[13:06:46] <mfranz> Hi, I was here a bit earlier, regarding some flash of unstyled content, I have fixed it with a blank html page as the action page for the form submit, so that the main page with the divs that flash through dont get printed before a redirect to the correct div with $.mobile.changepage, however this puts the blank (temp.html) page in history, is there a better solution than this
[13:07:22] <mfranz> I mean that in the <form id="form_id" method="post" action="blank.html">
[13:07:32] <mfranz> that seems to work, but I don't think it is a very eligant solution
[13:22:15] <gseguin> toddmparker: deployed 1.1.2 and 1.2.1
[13:53:21] <JasonDScott___> _|Nix|_: I think this commit broke sliders on mobile devices, I cant drag the handle. When I check it on my BB event.which = 0  - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/82b247c29199f41e93b62855cf514ab106eff967#js/widgets/forms/slider.js

[14:00:40] <frequent> yup. Let me try tomorrow, I have one more problem with updating the columntoggles. then I should be ok
[14:28:52] <_|Nix|_> JasonDScott___: The point was fot it to only work with the left mouse button.
