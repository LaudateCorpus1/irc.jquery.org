[08:41:01] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:41:40] <StevenBlack> Salut ghislain
[08:42:58] * gseguin is working on the pull request for the nested lists
[08:43:25] * StevenBlack is going sailing, leaving in 10.
[08:44:07] <gseguin> is that just to make me envious StevenBlack ? ;-)
[08:44:48] <StevenBlack> ... for 2 days, on a kick-ass Farr-44.  So yes :-)
[08:45:46] <gseguin> come on, a little bit of compassion for the people on the west coast who are just starting their day
[08:46:31] <StevenBlack> Ok.  Try this: http://www.jonoknight.com/yachting/images/gauchoplaneds.jpg
[08:49:14] <gseguin> nice!
[08:52:43] <gseguin> kinblas_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1779 is ready for your review
[10:34:25] <gseguin> _nickel: So you abandoned your jshint-service for jQM ?
[12:03:10] <_nickel> gseguin: ?
[12:23:41] <ldleworker> Can someone visit http://dev.mobsav.com/ and visit the 'join the mob' button at the the bottom - then hit the back button and tell me if the scroll position is broken?
[12:25:28] <ldleworker> The page-lead page is an internal div page that's transitioned to. if you click on any of the coupons the page it takes you to is ajax loaded. going back from these ajax pages does not cause the scroll position bug
[12:56:39] <ldleworker> Here is a jsfiddle with a minimal example: http://jsfiddle.net/Qdbns/
[13:02:39] <gseguin> _nickel: I thought I saw a tweet mentioning that, did I misread?
[13:02:56] <_nickel> gseguin: dunno but its still up if you want to use it :D
[13:03:15] <_nickel> gseguin: I did tweet about wishing I had deployed to heroku
[13:03:21] <_nickel> which I plan to do at some point
[13:03:26] <gseguin> oh ok
[13:03:38] <gseguin> we forked
[13:03:50] <gseguin> to have options and globals configurable
[13:04:07] <gseguin> and also have only the js file you're commiting being checked
[13:04:52] <gseguin> _nickel: I think we pushed everything to github, if you're interested
[13:05:41] <_nickel> the pre-commit only checks those files staged in the index which is what your commiting, what did you change?
[13:05:54] <_nickel> s/your/you're/
[13:06:14] <_nickel> awesome about the options and globals
[13:06:14] <ldleworker> Here's a minimal JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Qdbns/
[13:06:37] <_nickel> gseguin: did you want to send a pull request so I can take a look and merge the changes in?
[13:07:05] <gseguin> _nickel: sure but it's using a form
[13:07:17] <gseguin> which I thought you didn't want
[13:07:27] <_nickel> ah yah I'd like to avoid that where possible
[13:07:31] <_nickel> cool though
[13:07:58] <gseguin> _nickel: I don't understand the reasoning behind that. Could you elaborate?
[13:08:13] <_nickel> its unecessary?
[13:08:37] <_nickel> I like to be able to hit it with curl or some other http lib that doesn't require some sort of mechanization
[13:08:55] <_nickel> just send in the text of the js to be validated
[13:08:59] <_nickel> and get the result back
[13:09:07] <gseguin> that's what we do
[13:09:25] <gseguin> curl -F content="<file.js"
[13:09:56] <gseguin> no attachement, it puts the content of file.js in the content field
[13:10:00] <_nickel> the conten is sent as a post param right?
[13:10:07] <gseguin> yep
[13:10:57] <_nickel> though your solution adhears more closely to REST I think its nice to segrate  the options as params and the js as the body
[13:11:13] <_nickel> let me take another look though
[13:11:33] <_nickel> its just a matter of taste at this point and thats a lame reason to do/not do something :P
[13:12:09] <gseguin> _nickel: hey that's fine, that's what forks are for ;-)
[13:13:32] * ldleworker gives puppy dog eyes.
[13:13:36] <_nickel> gseguin: I like yours better
[13:13:41] <_nickel> gseguin: pull request?
[13:14:12] <gseguin> _nickel: coming
[13:14:43] <ldleworker> If someone can just confirm this minimal example isn't doing something obviously wrong I'll file a ticket: http://jsfiddle.net/Qdbns/
[13:14:49] <_nickel> gseguin: cool it looks like it defaults to the server's config too when its not provided
[13:15:22] <_nickel> ldleworker: what are you attemptin to accomplish
[13:15:32] <ldleworker> all it does is load a hidden div page
[13:15:36] <ldleworker> when you click the back button
[13:15:38] <ldleworker> the dom is messed up
[13:15:53] <ldleworker> its just two pages, one with a listview and then an anchor button
[13:15:58] <ldleworker> very minimal
[13:17:14] <ldleworker> you can jank it by going back and forth with the browser navigation
[13:17:30] <ldleworker> but clicking the anchor->then clicking the generated back button = messed up dom
[13:19:05] <ldleworker> a full fledged example can be seen at http://dev.mobsav.com/  with the "Join the Mob" button at the bottom - the Fiddle is structurally equivalent though.
[13:20:14] <_nickel> ldleworker: file a bug on that one
[13:20:22] <_nickel> ldleworker: well
[13:20:33] <_nickel> ldleworker: actually if you can try it out with the latest from the repository that would be better
[13:20:38] <gseguin> _nickel: were you looking at the options branch?
[13:20:39] <ldleworker> _nickel, another thing you can do is, click the anchor, then use the browser navigation back button and the header and title dissapear
[13:20:43] <_nickel> gseguin: yes
[13:20:45] <ldleworker> _nickel, I will do that
[13:20:51] <gseguin> do you want all of it
[13:20:55] <_nickel> ldleworker: it might already be fixed
[13:20:59] <_nickel> gseguin: yah!
[13:21:03] <ldleworker> _nickel, roger that. Thanks for the repsonse.
[13:21:25] <ldleworker> _nickel, is there a nightly build soemwhere?
[13:21:28] <_nickel> gseguin: if I get time or you feel like it it would be cool to skip out on the config file in the pre commit shell script where possibe, though curl pay already handle that for you
[13:21:32] <_nickel> ldleworker: there is!
[13:21:43] <ldleworker> found it
[13:21:45] <_nickel> :D
[13:21:47] <_nickel> great
[13:21:50] <_nickel> thanks for taking the time to submit
[13:22:04] <_nickel> and to persist in getting out attention
[13:22:12] <_nickel> s/out/our/
[13:22:18] <gseguin> _nickel: can you rephrase?
[13:22:39] * gseguin fixing whitespace issues before issuing pull request
[13:22:43] <_nickel> gseguin: it looks like the pre-commit.sh requires the options file unless curl handles when its missing
[13:23:06] <_nickel> gseguin: I'm not familiar with the "<$foo" construct
[13:23:20] <ldleworker> _nickel, in the newest version do headers no longer get default back buttons?
[13:23:34] <_nickel> ldleworker: yes, you can configure it though
[13:23:45] <ldleworker> know it off-handed?
[13:23:45] <gseguin> gseguin: oh gotcha
[13:24:04] <gseguin> gseguin: yeah it's probably not gonna be happy if the files aren't there
[13:24:20] * gseguin is talking to himself :)
[13:24:36] <gseguin> _nickel: yeah it's probably not gonna be happy if the files aren't there
[13:24:54] <_nickel> gseguin: other than that its pretty awesome!
[13:25:12] <_nickel> ldleworker: I don't let me see if I can find it
[13:25:57] <_nickel> kinblas: back buttons are disabled by default now, but you can turn them back on correct?
[13:26:04] <gseguin> _nickel: was your original script with tabs or spaces?
[13:26:17] <_nickel> gseguin: tabs - I've been corrupted by the jquery standards :(
[13:26:27] <ldleworker> _nickel, \o/ its fixed in latest
[13:26:39] <gseguin> _nickel: $.mobile.page.prototype.options.addBackBtn = true;
[13:36:34] <_nickel>  ldleworker ^
[13:36:37] <_nickel> gseguin: thanks much sir
[13:36:41] <ldleworker> _nickel, indeed thanks guys
[13:36:51] <_nickel> ldleworker: sorry it took so long to help you out
[13:36:52] <gseguin> you're welcome
[13:38:02] <ldleworker> _nickel, are you a leader of JQM?
[13:38:13] <_nickel> ldleworker: hah, I'm a contributor
[13:38:36] <_nickel> scottjehl and toddparker are the dev and design leads respectively
[13:39:03] <_nickel> ldleworker: I've applied for the head janitor position on the project but I haven't heard back ;)
[13:51:58] <ldleworker> _nickel, how long is beta off?
[13:52:06] <ldleworker> or rather, how far off is beta?
[13:52:31] <_nickel> I think we're getting pretty close, we're working on a navigation refactor befre beta and thats still a blocker
[14:05:11] <ldleworker> Oh this is silly. With latest, now on Android, the site does not constraint to the viewport width.
[14:05:13] <ldleworker> -.-
[14:05:18] <ldleworker> This is a never ending battle, lol
[14:06:31] <ldleworker> _nickel, anything I should know about latest in terms of viewport constraints?
[14:11:34] <ldleworker> nm I commented out my meta for some reason
[14:14:49] <ldleworker> Last question for today: Is there anyway to globally turn off active, pressed and hover styles?
[14:15:12] <ldleworker> you can't really hover with a touch-screen so I feel like it would boost performance
[14:17:26] <_nickel> ldleworker: I don't think there is sorry, you might conside implementing that yourself in a rough fashion and doing some profiling
[14:17:38] <_nickel> if you find it does make a difference then you can submit a ticket with your findings
[14:17:44] <_nickel> that would be pretty cool actually
[14:19:29] <ldleworker> Heh I dare not.
[14:25:52] <_nickel>  ldleworker you could just do it for listviews for example you don't have to do it for everything
[14:25:59] <_nickel> then create a huge listview
[14:26:01] <_nickel> and see what happends
[14:26:07] <_nickel> -d
[14:26:22] <_nickel> you'd probably have to profile after that point
[14:26:27] <_nickel> anyway
[14:26:30] <_nickel> its a thought
[15:54:27] <gseguin>  ks
[15:55:02] * gseguin is typing his typos in the wrong window
[17:01:45] <gseguin> can someone close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1617
[22:01:14] <gseguin_> hey _nickel
[22:01:24] <gseguin_> can you land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1617
[22:01:33] <gseguin_> it's just a whitespace change
[22:01:42] <gseguin_> sorry wrong link
[22:02:12] * gseguin_ is retrieving the right link
[22:03:01] <gseguin_> _nickel https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1784
