[02:29:21] <_|Nix|_> Wow! The navigation corner case saga continues: Try this: 1. New tab; 2. Go to http://slashdot.org/; 3. Go to http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html#/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html&ui-state=dialog; 4. Open the dialog; 5. close the dialog;
[02:30:11] <_|Nix|_> ... but you must do it safari or chrome ( webkit ), or IE ( I tried 8 ). Opera and FF work fine.
[02:30:38] <_|Nix|_> It seems that under these conditions a history entry for the dialog is not created.
[02:31:33] <_|Nix|_> However, if the URL is of the form http://domain/path1#path2&ui-state=dialog, it works everywhere except IE8 ...

[03:51:18] <agcolom> Hi _|Nix|_ yes, just tested that in Safari!!! What is happening???
[03:52:09] <agcolom> Really strange because I have never experienced this before with the dialogs!
[04:55:45] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What's happening is that you're opening a URL that looks exactly like the one you get by opening a dialog from that first page, so the browser never bothers creating a new history entry, because it would be identical to the current history entry.
[05:00:00] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... but firefox and opera will do it ...
[05:29:16] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, so I guess this is what the "we don't support deep-linking of dialogs (and now popups)" is all about.
[05:48:59] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ ok, but is this something we can do something about (i.e. force a new URL in the browser for example, or force an entry in the history?)
[05:56:35] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ sorry, I've just realised the deep linked link !!! So it's not so bad... I get now what we need to add in the docs!
[05:59:34] <agcolom> (sorry I've had a bad night... I thought my son had appendicitis...So only slept a few hours! He's better now...) hence missed the deep linking link above, and thought that was now happening all the time when opening a dialog!!!! That would have been bad!

[07:12:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/4001_FlashFix] Fixes #4001 - Page flash after transition - Jason Scott
[07:38:36] <JasonDScott> Hi all!
[07:38:42] <JasonDScott> I need some help testing a change on other devices.
[07:39:39] <JasonDScott> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/4001_FlashFix/index.html to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4001
[07:39:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4001 on jquery-mobile (jasondscott; 1m, 2w ago): Page flashes after transition is complete on BlackBerry 7.1
[07:40:52] <JasonDScott> I have tested on BlackBerry, iPad, chrome and firefox. I was hoping someone could give Android some testing
[07:48:24] <agcolom> Hi Jason, I'm here... I can test on iOS devices
[07:49:20] <agcolom> Sorry, just read you need Android... I haven't got one of those.... I can test on my iPod Touch if that's something you haven't done yet....
[07:49:43] <agcolom> JasonDScott ^
[07:50:51] <JasonDScott> agcolom: That would be great. Thanks Anne
[07:51:56] <agcolom> ok. do you have a special page or just any docs page? (the issue seems to be rc2 docs?)
[07:52:33] <agcolom> that one?  http://jquerymobile.com/branches/4001_FlashFix/index.html
[07:52:45] <JasonDScott> Yes, exactly
[07:53:10] <JasonDScott> All transitions should be tested and form selects
[07:56:03] <agcolom> doing the transitions now...
[07:57:40] <agcolom> I seem to get a flash effect after pressing the back button after a successful turn or flip transition
[07:57:57] <agcolom> also on pop
[07:58:30] <agcolom> actually they all seem to do that. The text flashes, but not the buttons....
[07:59:04] <JasonDScott> This was not happening before, correct?
[07:59:25] <agcolom> I'm on http://jquerymobile.com/branches/4001_FlashFix/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[07:59:50] <agcolom> Shall I try the master to compare or will that be the same?
[08:00:54] <JasonDScott> Yes, can you try master?
[08:01:43] <agcolom> not happening on master...
[08:02:09] <JasonDScott> :(
[08:02:11] <JasonDScott> ok
[08:02:13] <JasonDScott> thanks
[08:02:23] <agcolom> Is that no good?
[08:02:49] <JasonDScott> Well its good that it is not happening in master
[08:03:06] <JasonDScott> Its not good that my fix doesn't work
[08:03:45] <agcolom> and your fix is in 4001_FlashFix?
[08:04:10] <JasonDScott> yes
[08:04:27] <agcolom> And are you getting the flash effect on the iPad?
[08:05:27] <JasonDScott> Now that you mention it, I am.
[08:05:33] <Wilto> Woah, transition stuff.
[08:06:25] <Wilto> You guys are into some tricky territory.
[08:07:18] <JasonDScott> Wilto: thanks :) I have been fighting with this for so long
[08:07:20] <agcolom> Ah. I notice that it happens exactly when the address bar goes to hide... Is that coincidence or is that the cause of the flash effect?
[08:07:36] <Wilto> Give the word and we’ll run it through the many FG gadgets—changes to transition things get tweaky in a hurry.
[08:07:51] <agcolom> Hey Wilto :-) how's coffee this morning?
[08:08:08] <Wilto> Not as strong as some wimpy baristas would have you believe!
[08:08:14] <Wilto> Four shots barely counts.
[08:08:43] <JasonDScott> Wilto: what are the "FG gadgets"?
[08:08:52] <Wilto> Every Phone Ever™.
[08:09:26] <agcolom> She was probably worried you'd go crazy ;-)
[08:09:43] <Wilto> —oh, backface visibility.
[08:09:54] <JasonDScott> problem?
[08:10:04] <Wilto> Maaaybe.
[08:10:23] <Wilto> It kicks in hardware acceleration on WebKit thingers, which is sometimes good.
[08:10:27] <Wilto> And sometimes bad.
[08:10:37] <Wilto> A lot of Androids freak the ’eff out.
[08:10:52] <JasonDScott> agcolom: do you notice a square artifact in the background of page-transitions on master and 1.1.0
[08:11:18] <Wilto> JasonDScott: When you have a sec, can you give `transform-style: preserve-3d;` a try in place of backface visibility?
[08:11:25] <Wilto> Just out of curiosity.
[08:11:30] <agcolom> I notice a background colour change
[08:12:06] <JasonDScott> Do notice it in http://jquerymobile.com/branches/4001_FlashFix/index.html
[08:12:07] <JasonDScott> ?
[08:12:16] <agcolom> when I go back after the transition page, the page is darker then normal.
[08:12:24] <JasonDScott> Wilto: I will try that.
[08:12:29] <agcolom> I don't notice it in your branch
[08:13:23] <JasonDScott> Ok me neither.
[08:14:12] <Wilto> I’m thinking preserve-3d might be a better option, where it might limit it to devices that only have 3D transforms anyway—thus we’re not kicking it in on clunky old Androids, which will support backface.
[08:14:18] <agcolom> no sorry I do
[08:14:27] <agcolom> before the flash it is slightly darker
[08:15:20] <JasonDScott> It seems to be related to the flash
[08:15:23] <agcolom> JasonDScott ^
[08:15:56] <agcolom> yes the address bar disappearing or the color
[08:15:57] <agcolom> ?
[08:16:14] <JasonDScott> Wilto: If preserve-3d doesn't work would we be able to do backface only for bb?
[08:16:35] <Wilto> JasonDScott: http://wil.to/_/ehh-run.gif
[08:17:01] <Wilto> That’s into some kinda scary territory.
[08:17:15] <JasonDScott> agcolom: for me the color, ipad address bar does not disappear
[08:17:31] <JasonDScott> Wilto: haha ok
[08:17:59] <Wilto> We’ll get something figured out, though.
[08:18:00] <agcolom> ok.... strange that it doesn't happen on the forward transition, only the back.
[08:18:32] <agcolom> It reminds me of the pagination transition from Filament group
[08:19:03] <agcolom> I get a blink on forward but not on backward if all the pages are in the same html file
[08:19:25] <agcolom> I can give you a link....
[08:22:01] <Wilto> …Android 2.2 is lookin’ fair. Doesn’t seem to impact the fade at all.
[08:23:02] <agcolom> Wilto: the problem is after hitting the back button for me.
[08:23:14] <Wilto> JasonDScott, agcolom: Have either of you tested in an iOS webview?
[08:23:20] <Wilto> Transitions get a little shaky in those.
[08:24:05] <agcolom> no. You mean in an iOS app with a webview?
[08:24:33] <agcolom> hangon... I have one for a recent-ish version. 1.1.0 I think
[08:25:29] <agcolom> It has the effect that we get on master
[08:25:41] <agcolom> darker shade then normal no flash
[08:26:14] <Wilto> Testing in a webview now…
[08:26:42] <agcolom> http://zsprawl.com/iOS/zapps/jqm-reference/
[08:27:55] <JasonDScott> transform-style: preserve-3d; -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d;
[08:28:06] <JasonDScott> does not work on ios or bb
[08:30:00] <Wilto> Gross.
[08:30:10] <Wilto> Wait, that’s on the page?
[08:32:00] <Wilto> iOS webview is looking okay.
[08:32:01] <agcolom> Wilto? you're talking about  http://zsprawl.com/iOS/zapps/jqm-reference/ ?
[08:32:20] <Wilto> Oh, no,  http://jquerymobile.com/branches/4001_FlashFix/index.html
[08:33:00] <agcolom> ok :-)
[08:34:10] <Wilto> We applied backface-etc. prior to a bunch of other updates, so I’m wondering if it might be okay now.
[08:34:19] <Wilto> Back soon; digging up the weird Androids.
[08:39:34] <toddparker> my concern with back face is it really ramps up memory use
[08:39:45] <toddparker> everyone suggests this as a "fix" for a range of issues
[08:39:54] <toddparker> but it can lead to crashes
[08:40:28] <toddparker> so i'm not comfortable adding this rule anywhere as a framework because it will cause instability
[08:40:45] <Wilto> Yeah; Android 4.0 is starting to bog down.
[08:40:54] <toddparker> that said, i'm ok with adding a note on this rule to the transition page explaining it's value and pro/cons
[08:41:28] <agcolom> Hey Todd, going to add those articles now...
[08:45:50] <JasonDScott> So, should I keep looking for another solution for #4001? Or just refer to a workaround?
[08:47:24] <JasonDScott> toddparker ^
[08:47:51] <Wilto> JasonDScott: I’d be cool with adding that line to the docs as a “potential workaround,” as long as we stress that they should test thoroughly.
[09:34:41] <jzaefferer> johnbender: around?
[09:41:29] <gseguin> toddparker: do you guys have a Galaxy Note in the test lab?
[09:42:13] <gseguin> Wilto: ^
[09:53:52] <johnbender> jzaefferer: indeed
[09:53:57] <johnbender> gseguin: they do
[09:54:04] <johnbender> they opened them on one of the calls :D
[09:54:11] <johnbender> jzaefferer: what can I do for yuo
[09:54:26] <gseguin> thanks johnbender
[09:55:45] <jzaefferer> johnbender: mostly a friendly reminder about the devlead meeting today, as you're not online on Skype :-)
[09:55:55] <johnbender> jzaefferer: sweet jesus
[09:56:01] <johnbender> I am burried in meetings today
[09:56:04] <johnbender> jzaefferer: but thank you
[09:56:06] <johnbender> I'm excited to join
[09:56:26] * johnbender feels priveleged to be among such august company
[09:56:53] <johnbender> *privileged
[09:57:05] <jzaefferer> august?
[09:57:23] <johnbender> jzaefferer: https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&ie=UTF-8&q=define%3A+august
[09:59:25] <jzaefferer> aight
[09:59:29] <Wilto> gseguin: Somewhere here, yeah. Whassup?
[09:59:32] <jzaefferer> something new every day :-)
[09:59:41] <johnbender> jzaefferer: best part of life!
[09:59:58] <jzaefferer> now get on Skype!
[10:00:02] <jzaefferer> (if you can?_
[10:00:03] <jzaefferer> )
[10:00:06] <johnbender> ah that's right lol
[10:00:10] <gseguin> we have a weird bug on the note and I wanted to check if that rang a bell to one of you
[10:00:11] <johnbender> managed to forget
[10:00:17] <gseguin> Wilto: ^
[10:00:21] <Wilto> jzaefferer: Are you waiting on Filamenters?
[10:00:28] <Wilto> Oh, wait, Todd is on it; nevermind.
[10:01:11] <gseguin> Wilto: in a native app with phonegap we get a "cannot access property clientWidth of undefined"
[10:03:16] <gseguin> the first grep points us at: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.event.js#L312
[10:03:31] <gseguin> but I find it very weird that we would end up there
[10:03:48] <gseguin> so I wanted to check if you had such report
