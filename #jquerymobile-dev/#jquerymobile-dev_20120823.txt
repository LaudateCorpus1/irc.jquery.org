[08:18:14] <toddparker> gseguin and johnbender - would one of you look at moving master to use 1.8
[08:18:26] <toddparker> 1.2 should use 1.8 by default, methinks
[08:25:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/a_I7YA

[08:50:49] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[08:50:49] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #573: FIXED in 24 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/573/
[08:56:53] <johnbender> gseguin: would you mind doing that, working in popup
[08:59:59] <gseguin> on it
[09:02:09] <toddparker> sorry, dropped off for a sec
[09:02:47] <gseguin> toddparker: I'll take care of jQuery 1.8
[09:02:50] <gseguin> on master
[09:13:11] <toddparker> thanks gseguin!
[09:13:17] <toddparker> uGoMobi: you here?
[09:13:26] <toddparker> see this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4865
[09:13:27] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes
[09:13:39] <toddparker> it's a nice idea - tabviewer = support for data-type="horizontal" on collapsible-sets
[09:13:57] * uGoMobi looking
[09:14:02] <toddparker> I suggested a few tweaks but I think with some CSS love, this is a nice solution
[09:14:23] <toddparker> sort of like adding full width collapsibles to make a collapsible list
[09:14:31] <toddparker> http://www.franckreich.de/members/jqm/tabview/sample.html
[09:14:45] <uGoMobi> yeah it's quite nice
[09:15:01] <toddparker> needs work, but a good idea
[09:15:12] <uGoMobi> something for 1.3?
[09:15:17] <toddparker> thought you might want to help polish that up
[09:15:30] <uGoMobi> sure, I will comment
[09:15:34] <toddparker> yeah, 1.3 seems reasonable of a change like this
[09:20:12] <johnbender> toddparker: are we adding a carousel to 1.3?
[09:27:07] <toddparker> johnbender: we could for sure. filament just released one that we could adapt
[09:27:21] <toddparker> http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_carousel/
[09:27:45] <johnbender> toddparker: I was just curious how many widgety things we were targetting for 1.3
[09:27:56] <toddparker> if we get finding, scott could probably land carousel and ajax include/fetch link for 1.3
[09:28:09] <toddparker> i was originally just going to do the latter
[09:28:31] <toddparker> but that is less of a widget (no UI), more of a utility
[09:28:39] <toddparker> all up for discussion
[09:37:19] <toddparker> johnbender: looking at the roadmap notes, i had a "touch drag" utility with carousel demo. I'll have to confer with Scott on how he thinks we should approach this
[09:38:37] <toddparker> johnbender: we had "Nav re-factor" in for 1.3
[09:38:49] <toddparker> would "Allow widgets to work outside a page container" be part of that?
[09:38:57] <johnbender> toddparker: no
[09:39:10] <johnbender> toddparker: it's going to be enough work abstracting the 2 major parts of nav
[09:39:15] <toddparker> so we should track that separately
[09:39:20] <johnbender> hash/pushstate and container transitiosn
[09:39:20] <toddparker> ok
[09:39:34] <johnbender> I'm aiming for hash and pushstate to start
[09:39:38] <johnbender> been thinking about that _alot_
[09:39:43] <toddparker> cool
[09:39:48] <toddparker> go to town
[09:40:00] <toddparker> anyway, don't want to distract you from popup
[09:40:04] <johnbender> :D
[09:42:31] <johnbender> Wilto: do you have a link to that bug
[09:42:37] <johnbender> I'm going to test it against my changes
[09:55:49] <Wilto> johnbender: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada ?
[09:56:04] <Wilto> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4883
[10:00:25] <johnbender> Wilto: "oooh good one, I did not specify"
[10:02:11] <toddparker> agenda for today's call - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QeOJkCXDdKup73_VBIfhxVTAiMcNhp6TZWMIQooTg4Y/edit#
[10:02:32] <Wilto> johnbender: http://bukk.it/canada.jpg
[10:03:30] <johnbender> Wilto: I was wondering if you would get the reference
[10:03:36] <johnbender> couldn't find a clip on the internets
[10:09:17] <johnbender> Wilto: the only one that doesn't work for me is the tel
[10:09:27] <johnbender> the empty href works perfect
[10:10:14] <johnbender> Wilto: and by "frozen" he means it's not possible to close the popup right?
[10:11:14] <johnbender> Wilto: if I click the popup screen after I've clicked either of those links it closes the popup in my local version
[10:18:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender created popup-simple (+1 new commit): http://git.io/x8Y7Qg
[10:18:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-simple] first pass at popup simplification - John Bender
[10:21:17] <toddparker> johnbender: one thought - since we're already plumbing in a way to not use history for popups, I think it may make sense to make this a real option and just opt WP7 into it. We've had requests for that anyway.
[10:25:00] <johnbender> kk
[10:34:02] <toddparker> our web connection is baaad today
[10:34:05] <toddparker> meeting in 25
