[01:34:00] <EmmaJ> hi
[01:34:03] <EmmaJ> anyoen awake?
[02:34:51] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #223: STILL FAILING in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/223/
[04:52:13] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_ uGoMobi:
[04:54:46] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[04:57:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so ie8 is totally broken in master
[05:02:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw you mentioning it to johnbender 
[05:03:07] <arschmitz> i was hoping my commit about the support tests on ie would fix it but no luck
[05:07:05] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[05:08:24] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5401 ain't too pretty either ... I'm still trying to figure out what's going on ...

[05:18:52] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 140393035 15Alexander Schmitz: Support: fix cssTransition support test (properly this time) for ie < 10
[05:19:27] <arschmitz> ?tell johnbender Nav is fixed it was a broken support test 
[05:19:27] <bot-t> arschmitz, Okay.
[05:19:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ?BOOM nav is fixed
[05:20:48] <arschmitz> all tests passing
[05:21:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: has this any influence on Windows Phone?
[05:21:16] <uGoMobi> WP8 still getting transitions?
[05:21:21] <arschmitz> probably 
[05:21:26] <arschmitz> it shouldnt get them right?
[05:22:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lesson for the future dont fix support tests at 1am wait till morning lol
[05:22:13] <uGoMobi> it shoud get transitions since its browser is based on IE10
[05:22:24] <arschmitz> oh wp8 ok sorry
[05:22:25] <uGoMobi> not sure it returns true on >9
[05:22:33] <arschmitz> i read it as 7 lol
[05:22:47] <arschmitz> yeah im not sure
[05:23:00] <arschmitz> i havent got a wp8 emulator
[05:23:53] <arschmitz> i thought i fixed this support test last night but i actually made it essentially the same lol
[05:24:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ie7 still has 3 nav tests failing but they are unrelated they are about dialogs and stale state
[05:30:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure we have a WP8 test device in the lab already
[05:30:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; ARM; Touch; IEMobile/10.0; so it will return true on ie > 9
[05:32:42] <arschmitz> so transitions should be fine on WP8
[05:43:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I m not sure if we should also test against IEMobile instead of just IE... div.innerHTML = "<!--[if gt IE " + ( ++v ) + "]><br><![endif]-->";
[05:44:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe not sure
[05:44:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I also see a note here about conditional comments no longer being supported in IE10 standards mode: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537512(v=vs.85).aspx
[05:46:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see an issue now on Win8/IE10... after a transition the back button doesn't work anymore
[05:46:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i had read that somewhere previously as well but didnt think about the fact that we are using conditional comments not user agent for the test
[05:46:58] <uGoMobi> only on second click which will nav back 2 pages in history
[05:47:48] <arschmitz> weird
[05:48:30] <arschmitz> our support test will still work for ie10 because it wont find ie10 as being ie at all since conditional comments dont work
[05:51:34] <uGoMobi> looks like it because I do see transitions on IE10
[05:52:31] <uGoMobi> was thinking    && $.mobile.browser.ie > 9     has to return true in order to make the test pass, so it won't work if IE10 igores the conditional comments in the test
[05:52:44] <uGoMobi> ignores*
[05:53:01] <arschmitz> no otherwise it would kick out everything :)
[05:53:38] <uGoMobi> I probably missed something
[05:55:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: happens to the best of us i messed it up when i fixed it the first time last night
[06:00:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: one thing with the conditional comment approach we use is ie10 returns false on $.mobile.browser.ie
[06:01:19] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:01:55] <arschmitz> not a major issue right this second or anything but not correct at all lol
[06:01:59] <uGoMobi> that's is what i was thinking... looking at the code now to get the whole picture
[06:03:19] <arschmitz> i think to fix it we would have to switch to useragent detection Boo!
[06:05:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4881
[06:06:00] <arschmitz> would make sense
[06:09:27] <uGoMobi> it would make sense to me if this line that you changed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/03930351a602dff133b11783e5c2905e11d5f7dc/js/jquery.mobile.support.js#L134 would become something like !$.mobile.oldIE
[06:11:04] <uGoMobi> because if I see this    && $.mobile.browser.ie > 9 && !opera    it appears to me as if every browser other than IE10 is kicked out
[06:15:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[06:15:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: actually this is the case
[06:15:47] <uGoMobi> latest wasn't updated yet
[06:15:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I tested your changes local
[06:16:10] <arschmitz> i did too and it was working for me?
[06:16:26] <uGoMobi> on firefox transitions don't work anymore
[06:16:39] <arschmitz> weird on chrome they do
[06:16:47] <uGoMobi> on chrome yes
[06:17:03] <uGoMobi> but chrome test against the part before the ||
[06:17:09] <arschmitz> oh yeah 
[06:17:12] <uGoMobi> "WebKitTransitionEvent" in window ||
[06:17:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[06:17:50] <arschmitz> ill update the current support test for now because $.mobile.ie is used more then just in support
[06:18:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry what change do you mean?
[06:18:45] <arschmitz> huh?
[06:19:00] <uGoMobi> update the current support test
[06:19:38] <arschmitz> !($.mobile.ie)
[06:19:52] <arschmitz> oops i mean just !$.mobile.borwser.ie
[06:20:00] <arschmitz> execpt spelled right
[06:22:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually i take that back its only in 5 places
[06:23:55] <arschmitz> the only place outside support its used is one line in popup
[06:26:37] <arschmitz> iv already changed it everywhere lol

[06:58:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ugh im sick of find issues the last two days lol
[06:59:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: controlgroups with multiple selects are broken in ie7 because of inline-block
[07:00:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: horizontal ones that is
[07:00:14] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/620/edit
[07:00:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I know
[07:00:34] <arschmitz> is there an open issue for it?
[07:00:57] <uGoMobi> don't think so
[07:01:03] <uGoMobi> we mention it in the docs
[07:01:20] <arschmitz> oh ok i didnt realize
[07:01:30] <uGoMobi> they are not broken... layout is messed up
[07:01:31] <arschmitz> is there a reason we dont fix it?
[07:01:36] <arschmitz> right
[07:02:01] <uGoMobi> not highest priority I think
[07:02:11] <uGoMobi> I had it somewhere on long to do list
[07:02:18] <arschmitz> i see
[07:02:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: how do we force inline block in ie7 i have always used zoom:1; *display:inline; but i know we dont use *hack ?
[07:03:34] <uGoMobi> that's why it isn't an easy fix
[07:03:42] <uGoMobi> maybe change to using float
[07:03:50] <uGoMobi> and display block
[07:04:01] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:04:23] <arschmitz> i wasent sure if there was some trick to force inline block for ie that was valid that i didnt know about
[07:05:13] <arschmitz> its too bad * is so easy and usefull lol
[07:23:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok your good with css and im very confused
[07:23:21] <arschmitz> im looking at the ie7 issue and it dosent actually use inline-block in a horizontal control group
[07:23:28] <arschmitz> it uses float
[07:24:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so im really not sure why its not working in ie7
[07:24:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, I forgot  that I already changed controlgroups to use float
[07:25:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so now im confused why its still not working in ie7 lol

[07:45:34] <arschmitz> im pushing it right now
[07:45:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will give selects in horizontal controlgroup on IE7 a look later

[07:47:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool im confused as to why its not already working lol
[07:47:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it's not clear to me too
[07:48:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I now rememer I gave this a look already after changing controlgroups to float instead of inline-block
[07:48:51] <uGoMobi> remember*
[07:49:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: remember what you found lol?
[07:49:29] <uGoMobi> it has to do with the width of the button
[07:49:44] <uGoMobi> obviously
[07:51:12] <uGoMobi> normally floating element gets the width of its content
[07:51:25] <arschmitz> oh and ie sucks like always so it dosent?
[07:52:13] <uGoMobi> ui-select is the floating element but it doesn't get just the necessary width of the ui-btn inside it
[07:52:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lame...
[07:53:21] <arschmitz> i really wish half of the company i work for wasent on ie7 lol
[07:56:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I got it... it's width: 100% which we set for ui-btn-text
[07:57:11] <arschmitz> ahh i see
[07:57:41] <uGoMobi> setting width: auto fixex it
[07:58:02] <uGoMobi> doesn't seem to break anything (checked on Chrome)
[07:58:25] <uGoMobi> but have to check with github "blame" to see why we set it
[07:58:37] <uGoMobi> and test on all browsers
[07:59:41] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[08:00:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah cool its easily fixable in theory at least lol
[08:25:03] <toddmparker> hey guys
[08:37:31] <gseguin> Wilto: was yesterday your birthday?
[08:45:12] <arschmitz> hi toddmparker
[09:08:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you "upgrade" the web-based stuff to "require" Chrome?
[09:08:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then you could do away with supporting IE7 :)
[09:09:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i assume you mean at my company? if so I wish but its actually a public facing website as well
[09:09:17] <arschmitz> all the non public facing stuff i do "require" chrome
[09:09:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, cool!
[09:10:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I see, so all the people go home and access the public-facing side with their home browsers?
[09:10:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sadly ~10% of our public traffic is still ie7
[09:10:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: customers and stuff access too 
[09:11:03] <arschmitz> so no control there at all
[09:11:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Egads ... maybe you should inject a button like Chrome does ... "upgrade to a modern browser here".
[09:11:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ oh how i wish i could but the powers that be want it to just work on everything
[09:12:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... doesn't IE7 have a bunch of vulnerabilities? You could install Chrome and set it as the ... but I digress ...
[09:12:57] <_|Nix|_> :)
[09:13:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it makes me sad everytime i spend time trying to support ie7
[09:14:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe you should pitch what that .au company did: Prices quoted to IE <= 7 are 5% higher than prices quoted to everyone else :)
[09:14:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ha ha that would be awesome and on cars it would be a huge ammount lol
[09:14:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, eh?
[09:15:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You could call it the compatibility maintenance fee ...
[09:16:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i like your thinking
[09:16:35] <arschmitz> and all of it goes to the it department to upgrade us of XP!!!

[09:16:55] <_|Nix|_> :)
[09:18:24] <_|Nix|_> ... but anyway ... I wanna see if /any/ of our code runs when you hit the back button on iOS Chrome ...
[09:18:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont understand ios chrome at all
[09:18:53] <_|Nix|_> That's right ... I was suspecting popstate ... 
[09:19:12] <arschmitz> its just a webview yet acts differently then other webviews
[09:19:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I figure if they use the same Webkit, that does not mean they use the same history management, password management, etc.
[09:20:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe its still very strange though
[09:20:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno much about what a webview is, but if it's merely a renderer for a document, then it's far from being a complete browser. You still need to tell it what it is that it should render.
[09:21:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: my knolodge is far from complete as well but my understnading is that its litterally just a mini safari window you can programaticly control
[09:22:47] <arschmitz> but from this issue it sounds like your probably closer then i am
[09:22:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, really? Still, it must restrict access to Safari's history, no? Otherwise you'd get all the autocomplete hits from Safari ... do you?
[09:23:07] <arschmitz> thats a good question im not sure
[09:27:03] <_|Nix|_> AHA! I have you now, young Skywalker!
[09:27:11] <_|Nix|_> That's a paraphrase.
[09:27:15] <_|Nix|_> Not a quote.
[09:27:43] <_|Nix|_> popstate is the faulty party.
[09:29:22] <arschmitz> DAMN YOU POPSTATE!
[09:42:23] <agcolom> hello all and happy new year :-) Are we moving to core 1.8.3 ?
[09:49:40] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hey! Happy New Year!
[09:50:02] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: We haven't yet ...
[09:50:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Interestingly, iOS Chrome does not have rounded corners.
[09:50:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... whereas Safari does.
[09:52:06] <arschmitz> agcolom: we already did https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.js
[09:52:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have rounded corners in ios chrome 
[09:53:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... weird ...
[09:53:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe there's an update, but I installed it like 10 days ago ..
[09:53:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: lol yeah what are you testing on im on iphone4 ios5
[09:53:49] <agcolom> we'll need to update the docs when we decide to go for it... maybe when we are getting ready to get 1.3.0 out?
[09:54:16] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Well, we've got some pretty nasty bugs still laughing at us.
[09:54:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm on iPod Touch iOS 6.0.1 - I think.
[09:54:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah at least nav is working on oldie again lol it was 100% broken previously
[09:55:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ill check ios6 ipad
[09:55:18] <arschmitz> 2
[09:55:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[09:55:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Minor correction: Buttons have rounded corners. Inset lists do not.
[09:55:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i get rounded corners there too
[09:56:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok i was on the popup page looking at buttons and popups
[09:56:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird. My collapsibles are also sharp.
[09:56:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Even on the popup page, the controlgroup is sharp.
[09:57:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It looks like ui-corner-all is broken, but ui-btn-corner-all is not.
[09:57:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: insent lists and collapsibles work fine for me too lol
[09:57:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... that's just weird ...
[09:57:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll upgrade or something ...
[09:58:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i downloaded them last week sometime
[09:58:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do I check if there's an update? Do I go to the app store or something?
[09:58:25] <arschmitz> yeah app store
[09:58:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Got it.
[09:58:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks!
[09:58:34] <arschmitz> cool
[09:58:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm all up-to-date.
[09:58:44] <_|Nix|_> WTF?!
[09:58:46] <arschmitz> figures
[09:58:58] <_|Nix|_> Maybe cuz I'm on iOS 6? But you checked that as well, right?
[09:59:03] <arschmitz> i dont know iv checked 2 different devices with two different ios versions
[09:59:07] <arschmitz> yeah im on 6 also
[09:59:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a minute - 6.0.1?
[09:59:42] <arschmitz> hmm not sure let me check
[10:00:03] <arschmitz> nope 6.0
[10:00:08] <arschmitz> ill upgrade
[10:00:13] <arschmitz> and see if it makes a difference
[10:01:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: To check what version of Chrome is on my iPod, do I also go to the store?
[10:01:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep, I do.
[10:01:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: 23.0.1271.100
[10:03:42] <arschmitz> thats what i have too
[10:03:55] <arschmitz> ios 6.01 is installing now
[10:03:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: D00d ... the popup page has a horizontal scrollbar on iOS Chrome ...
[10:04:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and once again not for me!
[10:04:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just you wait till the upgrade finishes :)
[10:04:45] <arschmitz> lol
[10:04:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Though shalt be h0rked!
[10:05:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it would figure that would just go and break chrome as soon as its released
[10:05:35] <arschmitz> like oh you all like this new browser... now were going to break the shit out of it
[10:06:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... Chrome had better not work on iOS!
[10:08:59] <arschmitz> ok all upgraded
[10:10:22] <arschmitz> and chrome comanded ....
[10:10:31] <arschmitz> thou corners shal be rounded!
[10:11:14] <arschmitz> and thou pages shal not have horizontal scroll bars!
[10:11:41] <arschmitz> thus spake ios 6.01  chrome 
[10:12:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sorry...
[10:13:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird. I guess my quaint old iPod has older libraries or something.
[10:13:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah which honestly makes no sense lo
[10:13:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: does docs/pages/popup/index.html have a horizontal scrollbar?
[10:14:03] <arschmitz> nope
[10:16:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: wish i knew someone else with an ipod touch

[13:22:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: fixing the css transition support tests ... what is broken that needs to be fixed?
[13:22:42] <arschmitz> nothing the fix from this morning i meant
[13:22:49] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[13:23:04] <arschmitz> i had found the issue working on panels which is what prompted me to fix it
[13:23:22] <arschmitz> so i applied the fix to panel as well to fix the original issue
[13:23:30] <arschmitz> but it breaks open on ie8 
[13:23:47] <uGoMobi> you merged branch master in slide-panel-refactor local?
[13:24:11] <arschmitz> no just applied the fix for the support test
[13:24:50] <arschmitz> (though i have merged them locally which shows the same issue its a whole seperate version)
[13:25:35] <arschmitz> whats odd is when the test is broken the open works
[13:27:33] <uGoMobi> Re: though i have merged them locally... does that mean you did merge master into slide-panel-refactor?
[13:27:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ^^
[13:28:11] <arschmitz> i have several local clones i have a merged and an unmerged one 
[13:28:31] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:28:55] <arschmitz> the unmerged one is a straight clone of whats on github
[13:30:17] <uGoMobi> but we have to look at the merged one
[13:31:15] <uGoMobi> i have to make a new branch from slide-panel-refactor and merge master in there to be able to give it a look
[13:32:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think i found the problem
[13:32:35] <arschmitz> its an update to validstyle
[13:32:58] <arschmitz> no i just need to see what in it ie8 doesnt like
[13:33:56] <arschmitz> nope i lied not that lol
[13:35:19] <arschmitz> ok i found it for real this time
[13:35:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its this line https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.support.js#L65
[13:36:41] <arschmitz> Wilto added it when updating the support tests
[13:36:52] <arschmitz> not added but modified
[13:37:24] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:37:44] <uGoMobi> IE7 is ok but IE8 has a problem with it?
[13:37:56] <arschmitz> for some reason yup
[13:38:00] <arschmitz> and ie9 is fine too
[13:38:20] <arschmitz> its a really small change too
[13:39:10] <uGoMobi> what is small? the change Wilto made or the change to fix it?
[13:41:16] <arschmitz> change wilto made
[13:41:32] <arschmitz> but its causing ie8 to pass cssTransform3d
[13:42:12] <arschmitz> strange ie8 passes it but ie7 dosent
[13:42:55] <arschmitz> ie9 passes to0
[13:42:57] <arschmitz> too
[13:43:05] <arschmitz> but for some reason the panel still works
[13:44:47] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15zachleat opened pull request #5412: Slide panel refactor tests (06slide-panel-refactor...06slide-panel-refactor)  02http://git.io/eyvkLg
[13:44:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh i take that back ie9 is passing and its causing nav problems
[13:45:36] <uGoMobi> IE8 doesn't pass the support tests on master http://jsbin.com/osiwuw/14/edit
[13:46:29] <uGoMobi> same for IE7
[13:46:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it does for me on there
[13:47:02] <arschmitz> ie9 passes too
[13:47:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: "on there" means when you check that JS Bin?
[13:47:36] <arschmitz> yes
[13:47:42] <arschmitz> also when i run $.support.cssTransform3d in the console
[13:49:22] <uGoMobi> IE not working on browserstack :(
[13:49:42] <uGoMobi> I used IETester on Win7 to test IE8
[13:49:44] <arschmitz> wheres Wilto: when you need him
[13:50:00] <arschmitz> im using ie9 as ie7
[13:50:03] <arschmitz> on win 7
[13:50:19] <uGoMobi> yeah I tested that too
[13:50:20] <arschmitz> im mean as ie8
[13:50:34] <arschmitz> try running $.support.cssTransform3d in the console
[13:50:42] <uGoMobi> IE9 passes 3Dtransform test
[13:50:50] <arschmitz> on http://jquerymobile.com/test/
[13:51:01] <arschmitz> yeah and ie9 shouldnt pass either
[13:51:23] <uGoMobi> true
[13:54:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how do you test IE8?
[13:54:30] <uGoMobi> do you have it installed on a machine there?
[13:54:35] <arschmitz> yes
[13:54:54] <uGoMobi> ok, probably more reliable than IETester
[13:54:58] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:55:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually your page does say false for ie8 i had my settings wrong 
[13:55:21] <arschmitz> but running in the console still says true for ie8
[13:56:02] <uGoMobi> maybe the IE developer tools are as buggy as the browser itself ;)
[13:56:42] <arschmitz> maybe but either way internally we are getting true
[13:56:51] <arschmitz> which is making it try to transition the panel
[13:57:03] <arschmitz> which does not complete so it doesnt show
[13:57:28] <arschmitz> also its trying to transition pages on ie9 which results in a blank page
[13:59:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ie10 has really messed up our support tests
[14:01:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't understand how that JS Bin can return false for IE8 but internally it passes the test
[14:01:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: neither do i!
[14:02:01] <uGoMobi> we call the same function
[14:02:21] <arschmitz> but i change the one line that wilto changed in the tests an all ie's execpt 10 work perfect
[14:02:43] <arschmitz> its kicks ten out of transforms then
[14:03:13] <uGoMobi> I am not sure when Wilto is back
[14:03:18] <arschmitz> it looks like perspective is some how valid on 8 and 9 
[14:03:33] <uGoMobi> might be good to discuss it with him
[14:03:36] <arschmitz> when testing unprefixed
[14:03:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i just hate to leave ie8 and 9 broken in master
[14:07:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you don't notice the issue on master
[14:07:41] <arschmitz> in master all navigation causes a blank page in ie for me
[14:08:31] <arschmitz> ok im losing my mind! and confused it didnt work 5 minutes ago now it does!
[14:09:12] <uGoMobi> all I see is the url not being updated when I check http://jquerymobile.com/test/ on IE9
[14:09:21] <uGoMobi> same issue as I saw on Android
[14:10:43] <arschmitz> i think im losing it
[14:12:38] <arschmitz> ok so master is ok 
[14:12:52] <arschmitz> well test is broken but it work
[14:12:54] <arschmitz> s
[14:14:35] <arschmitz> i wonder if we put a failsafe in to show the page if transition dosent complete
[14:14:50] <arschmitz> to still show the page
[14:15:01] <arschmitz> maybe as part of the nav refactor or something
[14:16:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that must be it because in my merged copy ie9 works fine
[14:16:20] <arschmitz> test still fails but it navigates like master
[14:16:32] <arschmitz> panels dont but thats because they have no failsafe
[14:17:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there are no conflicts to merge them should probably just merge master into slide-panel-refactor
[14:18:06] <arschmitz> and then let wilto check out the broken test
[14:19:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think it's better to wait until the guys from Filament who have been working on slide-panel are back
[14:21:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yea
[14:22:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just because I don't know what they are still working on
[14:23:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: on the ther hand... toddmparker_ asked us to look into the issues too
[14:23:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats why i had been working on all this
[14:23:55] <uGoMobi> I know
[14:24:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: since there are no conflicts i suppose if i did it and it messed something up for them the commit could just be reverted
[14:25:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dunno
[14:25:05] <uGoMobi> well we could always revert
[14:25:12] <uGoMobi> right
[14:25:21] <arschmitz> lol delay!
[14:25:48] <arschmitz> i wonder what the delay is from here to amsterdam?
[14:26:27] <uGoMobi> just had a feeling we were rushing a bit too much... but merging master in there shouldn't be a problem
[14:26:41] <uGoMobi> yeah delay... it's IRCCloud
[14:26:59] <uGoMobi> :(
[14:27:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[14:27:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so merge then you think?
[14:27:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[14:27:43] <arschmitz> ok
[14:30:07] <arschmitz> doh i lied there is a conflict in fixedtoolbars
[14:30:38] <arschmitz> i merged the other way before slidepanel into master not master into slide panel 
[14:30:55] <uGoMobi> huh?
[14:31:13] <uGoMobi> ah ok i get it
[14:31:59] <uGoMobi> what change have been made to fixedToolbar in slide-panel-refactor branch?
[14:33:43] <arschmitz> nevermind i was looking at wrong line it was support because i had updated in both
[14:33:55] <arschmitz> so thats easy enough to resolve
[14:35:28] <arschmitz> ugh its been too long of a day
[14:37:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im going to push this merge and then go get some dinner so i can look at things with a clear mind later lol
[14:37:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so ill see you in the morning
[14:38:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah good idea... better to look twice and with clear mind
[14:38:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[14:38:51] <uGoMobi> enjoy your dinner, see you tomorrow... good night!
