[02:51:16] <aaronmcadam> yo
[02:51:25] <xjjk> hallo
[02:51:28] <aaronmcadam> the lads don't be around at this time
[02:51:48] <aaronmcadam> are u in holland?
[02:51:54] <aaronmcadam> or where?
[02:51:57] <xjjk> yeah, I'm going to sleep myself… simplify the testcase I have tomorrow
[02:52:06] <xjjk> New Mexico, USA (4 am here)
[02:52:06] <aaronmcadam> ah good stuff
[02:52:10] <aaronmcadam> ah right
[02:52:15] <aaronmcadam> I'm in england, 10:52
[02:52:46] <aaronmcadam> cool, the team want loads of issues and test cases with jsfiddles if possible so fire away!
[02:53:33] <xjjk> ah, forgot about jsfiddle, was going to post it as a gist
[07:44:59] <toddparker> hey all
[08:36:57] <aaronmcadam> hiya toddmparker_
[08:37:00] <aaronmcadam> wtf haha
[08:37:08] <aaronmcadam> xchat autocomplete
[08:37:54] <aaronmcadam> can i ask you if you've heard of this bug todd, I've got collapsible headers, and they're being truncated from the start of the string like this: "...e small print"
[08:38:03] <aaronmcadam> I'm trying to pin down the cause
[09:03:23] <aaronmcadam> found the culprit
[09:03:35] <aaronmcadam> ui-btn-text is causing my text to be truncated from the start of the string
[09:04:02] <aaronmcadam> the class
[09:06:33] <aaronmcadam> ah! it's a regression from latest, rc1 works!
[09:14:41] <Wilto> Damn you, .ui-btn-text
[09:22:09] <toddparker> arg!
[09:22:38] <toddparker> aaronmcadam: if you can figure out what css change is causing this, please let us know
[09:22:48] <toddparker> actually, can you file a ticket with a test page?
[09:22:48] <Wilto> Any chance you have a jsbin kicking around for this, aaronmcadam?
[09:22:50] <aaronmcadam> I dunno tho
[09:22:55] <Wilto> Yeah, that’d be awesome.
[09:23:14] <aaronmcadam> I'll create an issue tomorrow, but firebug couldn't help me, no white-space rules were on the ui-text
[09:23:25] <aaronmcadam> if i removed the ui-text class, the truncation went away
[09:23:40] <Wilto> That’s a weird one.
[09:23:48] <aaronmcadam> it's 5:23 here I'm in england
[09:23:50] <aaronmcadam> very
[09:24:06] <aaronmcadam> I just switched to rc1 from latest and it's ok
[09:24:38] <aaronmcadam> hmm and it's the very same generated class too
[09:25:22] <Wilto> aaronmcadam: … Try removing “position: relative;” from .ui-btn-text.
[09:25:34] <Wilto> Just out of curiosity.
[09:26:33] <aaronmcadam> bingo Wilto
[09:26:40] <Wilto> Sigh.
[09:26:45] <aaronmcadam> why was that added?
[09:26:48] <Wilto> Right. On it.
[09:26:52] <aaronmcadam> to apply z-index
[09:27:14] <aaronmcadam> why does it need z-index? or is this a case of ui-btn-text in another context Wilto?
[09:27:59] <Wilto> Yeah; it was a workaround for some click target issues introduced fairly recently.
[09:28:04] <aaronmcadam> ah
[09:28:13] <aaronmcadam> this the vclick problem?
[09:28:19] <Wilto> I think there was a rework of the button markup, not too long ago?
[09:28:26] <Wilto> No, separate issue, I believe.
[09:28:33] <aaronmcadam> cool, just surmising :)
[09:29:30] <aaronmcadam> I've been on other things the past 2 weeks so I'm upgrading from effectively beta2
[09:30:01] <aaronmcadam> I have to say, fantastic work on the bug fixes guys, see you putting out loads of fires Wilto, awesome :D
[09:30:20] <Wilto> Would you mind filing an issue, when you have a chance? A test case would he helpful—jsbin or somesuch.
[09:30:21] <aaronmcadam> i'm just removing the workarounds I had in place for some issues
[09:30:33] <aaronmcadam> I've got a fiddle i need to add markup to
[09:31:04] <Wilto> Sweet. Thanks, man.
[09:31:28] <aaronmcadam> doing it now :)
[09:34:15] <Wilto> Even better. I’ll keep you posted.
[09:35:08] <aaronmcadam> typical, can't reproduce it lol
[09:35:18] <aaronmcadam> Trying to do it too quickly :D
[09:38:28] <aaronmcadam> got it!
[09:38:32] <aaronmcadam> it's a firefox issue!
[09:38:37] <aaronmcadam> Wilto: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/QvhhD/
[09:38:48] <aaronmcadam> I can still file a proper bug in the morning if u wish
[09:38:54] <Wilto> New Firefox?
[09:38:57] <Wilto> Yeah, that’d be awesome.
[09:38:58] <aaronmcadam> 7.0.1 yep
[09:39:28] <Wilto> Hm. Okay in 6.0.2.
[09:39:31] <Wilto> Weird.
[09:40:19] <aaronmcadam> it displays if pos is absolute but obviously that contracts all the heights of the heading wrappers
[09:41:32] <aaronmcadam> I've looked at the inheritance stack in firebug and no mention of white-space rules apart from .ui-btn-inner
[09:41:43] <aaronmcadam> I've disabled that rule of white-space:nowrap
[09:42:14] <aaronmcadam> ah, removing that class shows the heading properly, but it's not padded in
[09:42:23] <aaronmcadam> is that any help Wilto?
[09:42:46] <Wilto> Just getting Firefox 7 on this machine—one sec.
[09:43:07] <aaronmcadam> hmm very strange that ff7 is the actual offender
[09:44:16] <Wilto> …Man. Yeah. Firefox 7 only.
[09:44:41] <Wilto> —They implemented overflow: ellipsis; in FF7.
[09:45:01] <Wilto> Just remembered. I’ll have to look into that.
[10:00:58] <toddparker> good time
[10:01:08] <toddparker> times
[10:01:30] <toddparker> hey guys - post issues of Q's you want to discuss in today's meeting here
[10:03:53] <johnbender> toddparker: my question "Now that adobe has released 64 bit flash for linux, will we be porting the entire library to it?"
[10:05:30] <Wilto> I think we can all agree that Flash is the future.
[10:08:02] <johnbender> indeed
[10:08:07] <johnbender> its the future on my laptop
[10:08:10] <johnbender> of that we can be sure
[10:08:13] <johnbender> it runs like a top too
[10:08:17] * johnbender is so happy
[10:11:23] <toddparker> johnbender: almost down with that
[10:11:34] <toddparker> finishing up my port to windows 3.1 first
[10:11:51] <Wilto> 3.11 for Workgroups support coming soon.
[10:12:08] <toddparker> oooh, that has networking support too
[10:13:24] <toddparker> gseguin, kinblas, scottjehl, Wilto - Skype?
[10:14:12] <Wilto> Loves me some Skype. Two minutes.
[10:15:38] <gseguin> toddparker: still at the hospital, I'll pass
[10:16:13] <toddparker> oh, sorry gseguin
[10:16:18] <toddparker> how goes it?
[10:16:22] <gseguin> no worries
[10:16:25] <gseguin> great
[10:16:40] <toddparker> any news?
[10:16:45] <gseguin> she was bron at 18:00 PDT yesterday
[10:16:45] <toddparker> tick tock
[10:16:55] <toddparker> oh, sorry I didn't catch that
[10:16:59] <toddparker> congratulations!
[10:17:04] <gseguin> thanks
[10:17:05] <toddparker> your first?
[10:17:09] <gseguin> 2nd
[10:17:14] <toddparker> ah, so you're a pro
[10:17:26] <toddparker> what's her name?
[10:17:29] <gseguin> heh :)
[10:17:34] <gseguin> Estelle
[10:18:01] <gseguin> 10.5lbs baby girl
[10:18:28] <toddparker> love that name
[10:18:36] <gseguin> thanks
[10:18:37] <toddparker> mega baby
[10:19:02] <gseguin> no kidding!
[10:19:07] <toddparker> when we had out second, i was smart enough to say" sure, we'll leave here in the nursery overnight"
[10:19:17] <toddparker> free sleep, yes please
[10:19:24] <gseguin> :)
[10:19:30] <TehShrike> Why am I seeing pagebeforechange fired twice?  I note in the dynamic-page demo, the code does if ( typeof data.toPage === "string" ) - which is what I have to do, too, or I get another message with wacky data.  I'm just curious, what is the purpose of that second message?
[10:19:46] <TehShrike> The current documentation seems to claim it will only fire once
[10:20:24] <TehShrike> To see the code in the demo: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dynamic-samples/sample-reuse-page.html line 155
[10:44:35] <johnbender> TehShrike: pagebeforechange should actually be after the pageLoad call I believe
[10:44:49] <johnbender> TehShrike: when kin gets back I'll double check that
[10:45:02] <johnbender> but it'll fire twice if the page hasn't been loaded into the dom yet
[10:45:15] <TehShrike> Oh really?
[10:45:21] <johnbender> it checks that, loads the page and recursively calls changepage with the loaded elem
[10:45:37] <johnbender> TehShrike: yah I did that whilst working on another issue a while back but I don't know if I pushed it
[10:45:41] <johnbender> don't recall
[10:45:53] <johnbender> there may be a specific reason for it though
[10:46:05] <johnbender> TehShrike: specifically to intercept the load process
[10:46:28] <johnbender> in fact thats most likely why but we should trigger it twice imo
[10:46:33] <TehShrike> hmm, it's definitely happening on every single pagebeforechange
[10:46:42] <TehShrike> Immediately after the valid/useful one
[10:46:42] <johnbender> yep
[10:46:58] <johnbender> both are valid and useful as far as the library is concerned :D
[10:47:14] <TehShrike> :-P fair enough.  What exactly is the second one used for?
[10:47:31] <johnbender> TehShrike: so the first call will load the page via ajax if it doesn't exist in the dom
[10:47:37] <johnbender> then call changePage with the new dom element
[10:47:54] <johnbender> so it calls itself
[10:48:00] <johnbender> thats the simplified version
[10:48:31] <TehShrike> It might be a good idea to note that in the docs.  I was using if($.mobile.path.parseUrl(data.toPage).href) until I saw how that sample page was doing it
[10:48:41] <johnbender> TehShrike: absolutel
[10:48:44] <TehShrike> Or something like that
[10:48:45] <johnbender> *absolutely
[10:56:05] <toddparker> agree that's worth noting. johnbender - you on it?
[10:56:23] <toddparker> anyone seen kin around?
[11:02:25] <johnbender> toddparker: I think he might be out this morning for a bit
[11:02:31] <johnbender> I recall an email
[11:02:38] <johnbender> let me look
[11:03:04] <toddparker> he's in the meeting. you?
[11:03:12] <toddparker> johnbender ^^
[11:03:24] <toddparker> kinblas: you on Skype?
[11:03:28] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm good to go, kin is handling some personal stuff this morning
[11:03:36] <johnbender> unless he's back already
[11:04:54] <kinblas> I'm here
[11:04:57] <kinblas> are we doing skype?
[11:05:01] <kinblas> or mirc?
[11:05:44] <toddparker> irc with Skype for backup chats
[11:05:56] <TehShrike> Google Hangout is where it's at
[11:14:04] <toddparker> kinblas: can you get on Skype too?
[11:14:28] <kinblas> sure
[11:15:08] <toddparker> don't see you or scottjehl online
[11:15:30] <kinblas> toddparker: on now
[11:15:48] <scottjehl> yep here
[11:34:26] <kinblas> johnbender: until I check it in you can access the bookmarklet here: http://shinarp.com/utils/watch-jqm-nav.html
[12:15:52] <TehShrike> The most common questions people ask apperat to be about how to dynamically add controls to page.  The pagebeforechange event seems to be the definitive place to do this, but I haven't seen too many examples of what to bind it to.
[12:15:52] <TehShrike> Binding to a page doesn't seem to work at all.  Right now, I'm binding to the document, parsing the URL in data.toPage, and using a switch statement to call page-specific functions.  Is there a supported way to bind to a specific page's pagebeforechange event?
[12:19:34] <kinblas> scottjehl: my viewport research was here
[12:19:35] <kinblas> http://webpro.host.adobe.com/people/jblas/research/viewport/
[12:24:39] <TehShrike> How did I manage to misspell appear so badly? 0_o
[12:24:44] <johnbender> TehShrike: kinblas: pagebeforechange fires twice
[12:25:28] <johnbender> kinblas: where the page needs to be loaded into the DOM
[12:28:05] <johnbender> TehShrike: hmm it might be better to do that on pagebeforeshow
[12:28:41] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah it fires twice if it is called with a URL
[12:28:54] <johnbender> kinblas: yah
[12:28:55] <kinblas> because the original changePage() call gets deferred until after it loads
[12:28:57] <johnbender> it uses loadpage
[12:28:58] <kinblas> the file
[12:29:04] <kinblas> I was a bit conflicted about that
[12:29:09] <johnbender> kk
[12:29:16] <johnbender> if you've thought through it I don't even want to bother right now
[12:29:20] <johnbender> we'll deal with it later
[12:29:26] <johnbender> :D
[12:29:45] <johnbender> TehShrike: you can ignore my last comment
[12:31:33] <kinblas> johnbender: the main issue I had
[12:32:20] <TehShrike> johnbender: all righty
[12:32:23] <kinblas> was that folks need a hook at the earliest moment to figure out if they w
[12:32:30] <johnbender> kinblas: yes!
[12:32:36] <johnbender> before anything happens
[12:32:39] <kinblas> ..wanted to handle things
[12:32:43] <johnbender> for templating
[12:32:44] <kinblas> I was thinking maybe I should fire a
[12:32:44] <johnbender> etc
[12:32:47] <kinblas> pagechangedeferred
[12:32:49] <kinblas> event
[12:33:01] <kinblas> to "close" out that pagebeforechange
[12:33:16] <johnbender> TehShrike: I think folks will just have to do that check for themselves
[12:33:33] <johnbender> TehShrike: I don't think we have the time or desire to alter it before 1.0, but thats just my take
[12:33:53] <TehShrike> johnbender: All right, fair enough
[12:34:48] <johnbender> kinblas: I was thinking pagebeforeload, but that doesn't make sense since we're not always "loading" so that makes good sense
[12:35:01] <johnbender> kinblas: that is, your suggestion makes sense
[12:35:07] * johnbender is starving for lunch
[12:35:11] <kinblas> grr, my machine is freezing up
[12:35:17] <TehShrike> Also, for the future, it would be nice if the docs considered the case of adding-controls-that-need-styles-applied-to-them more in the docs - jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dynamic-samples/sample-reuse-page.html is the first solid example I think I've found in the docs
[12:35:45] <TehShrike> And it seems a lot of people want to do that, especially those of us cramming all our dynamic pages into a single set of pages for Phonegap
[12:36:46] <kinblas> so I just read TehShrike's original question
[12:37:18] <kinblas> pagechange, pagebeforechange, and pagechangefailed are fired on the "page container" not a page
[12:37:36] <TehShrike> hmm, ok
[12:37:51] <kinblas> the reason is
[12:37:58] <kinblas> most of the times the pages don't exist
[12:38:19] <TehShrike> I guess the obvious followup question is, what's the selector for the page container? :-x
[12:38:21] <kinblas> and we need an element folks can bind to that is around in both the success and failure case
[12:38:32] <TehShrike> Right
[12:38:55] <TehShrike> All right, well as long as that use case is percolating around in your minds for an upcoming version, that's cool.
[12:39:05] <kinblas> the 2nd reason
[12:39:20] * kinblas gets frustrated with his machine freezing every few seconds
[12:40:37] <kinblas> The 2nd reason is that when we start working on tablet ui patterns
[12:41:18] <kinblas> there will be multiple page containers
[12:41:38] <TehShrike> O RLY?
[12:42:38] <kinblas> TehShrike: well, my plan is to  keep the body as the default page container
[12:42:42] <kinblas> but you will be able to nest
[12:42:46] <kinblas> other page containers
[12:42:51] <kinblas> so they can each load pages independently
[12:42:53] <TehShrike> Huh, cool
[12:43:00] <kinblas> ala tablet app ui
[12:44:31] <kinblas> so those are the main reasons we fire on the page container versus a page
[12:44:48] <kinblas> I need to reboot, this freezing is killing me
[12:44:51] <kinblas> brb
[14:50:53] <toddparker> kinblas: were you running lots of adobe apps :)
[14:51:05] <toddparker> kidding, heading out
[14:54:13] <kinblas> toddparker: pa-dum-pum ... wow, hit and run
