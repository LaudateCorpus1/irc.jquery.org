[07:19:43] <rwaldron> heeyyyy
[07:20:23] <rwaldron> I'm wondering when would be cool to come over to Filament this week
[08:04:56] <Wilto> Anytime, my man.
[08:05:52] <Wilto> Todd’s out of town, but I’m just working on various and sundry bugs for the next couple of days. No crazy deadlines afoot or anything.

[09:24:01] <Wilto> Notta thing, gseguin.
[09:24:03] <gseguin> Aaaaaarrrrrggggh
[09:24:11] <Wilto> I’m seeing some require.js cruft kicking around still—patching it up now.
[09:24:13] <gseguin> I was commenting on that PR
[09:24:20] <gseguin> :)
[09:24:43] <gseguin> actually I checked the branch and there was no ref to require.js
[09:25:18] <gseguin> I think the only valid line there was the jquery.mobile.css line
[09:25:39] <gseguin> Wilto: it also re-introduce the themeswitcher
[09:25:49] <Wilto> Hates me some themeswitcher.
[09:26:09] <Wilto> Waaait.
[09:26:25] <Wilto> I got a bunch of references to require.js in the docs. That should only be occurring in the tests, yeah?
[09:26:35] <gseguin> the other thing is, I'm not sure we should maintain 1.0-stable anymore
[09:27:03] <gseguin> yes, require.js should only be in tests
[09:27:09] <gseguin> and only in master
[09:27:22] <Wilto> Hm. Okay, doin’ some housekeeping, then.
[09:28:14] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: you guys around?
[09:28:32] <Wilto> johnbender: Yes sir.
[09:28:34] <gseguin> Wilto:  is
[09:28:39] <gseguin> :D
[09:28:46] <johnbender> Wilto: scott did another merge from master to master so maybe it snuck back in ...
[09:29:06] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: about to publish a blog article I've been working on for a week so any retweetage you can spare would be greatly appreciated
[09:29:07] <gseguin> what? the require.js in docs?

[09:39:31] <Wilto> Crayons _are_ pretty awesome.
[09:40:07] <gseguin> Is that you use to put border on things?

[10:02:25] <gseguin> thanks peol
[10:34:06] <Wilto> Question, gseguin / johnbender.
[10:34:20] <gseguin> yes sir?
[10:35:03] <Wilto> require( { baseUrl: "../../js" }) ( [ "jquery.mobile.docs" ] )
[10:35:22] <Wilto> What up with that.
[10:36:04] <gseguin> where is that?
[10:36:22] <Wilto> On a bunch of pages that still have require stuff kicking around.
[10:36:30] <gseguin> it configures requirejs and then immediatly invokes require
[10:36:57] <Wilto> It looks like it just pulls in ../docs/_assets/js/jqm-docs.js and sorts it into the right load order, yeah?
[10:37:05] <gseguin> baseUrl is the ref directory for module paths
[10:37:24] <Wilto> So if I’m nuking that and linking back to the docs JS prior to /js/, I should be good, yeah?
[10:37:42] * gseguin takes a look
[10:38:14] <Wilto> I mean, I assume I’m fine scrapping all the require.js stuff—I just want to know what the deal is.
[10:39:24] <gseguin> sorry the checkout is taking longer than it should
[10:40:13] <gseguin> yeah so if you put a script tag for jqm-docs and then one for /js/
[10:40:18] <gseguin> it should do the same thing
[10:40:40] <gseguin> that's what jquery.mobile.docs does
[10:40:53] <gseguin> that's why it's using the order! plugin
[10:41:57] <gseguin> though I'm not even sure that is guaranteed to work the way it's done there

[13:40:52] <johnbender> Wilto: well that explains why they weren't removed when I did my pass

[13:56:20] <Wilto> I think I want to fight Jenkins.
[13:56:37] <Wilto> I’m sick of his sass.
[13:57:17] <johnbender> Wilto: when they move the jenkins instane our "latest" builds will probably be done using buildbot
[13:57:28] <johnbender> s/instane/instance/
[13:57:52] <johnbender> Wilto: ok I'm going to look into the checkbox issue
[13:58:09] <johnbender> gseguin: tbenzige: were you guys able to sort something out for the css comments?
[13:58:12] <Wilto> Badass. Thanks for tagging in on that, man.
[13:58:13] <johnbender> I'm curious how that will work out
[13:58:24] <johnbender> Wilto: np np hopefully it'll be quick
[13:58:45] <Wilto> Said issue is now officially jinxed.
[14:00:10] <johnbender> Wilto: actually I think it's just the attr problem again
[14:00:25] <johnbender> which would explain why the tests don't catch it
[14:19:40] <gseguin> johnbender: I haven't started working on it
[14:19:51] <gseguin> got side tracked
[14:20:05] <johnbender> gseguin: no worries
[14:20:07] <johnbender> just curious
[14:20:18] <gseguin> getting to it now
[14:23:50] <gseguin> johnbender: so if we got rid of requirejs for docs, we can probably clean up the docs target quite a bit
[14:25:31] <johnbender> gseguin: the latest build still uses the compiled docs
[14:25:40] <johnbender> I didn't change that
[14:26:08] <gseguin> but Wilto removed all references to jquery.mobile.docs
[14:26:11] <gseguin> from the docs
[14:26:37] <gseguin> so we can probably get rid of the meta module jquery.mobile.docs

[14:34:55] <jq-jenkins> john.m.bender: add commit sha to deployed js and css
[14:37:27] <Wilto> Sorry, refresh my memory: where is post-1.1 stuff goin’, branch-wise?
[14:39:21] <Wilto> I was fixing a styling issue and kind of went into a style-fixing fugue across all the form widgets.
[14:39:33] <Wilto> Not something I want to sneak in under the radar for 1.1.
[14:40:03] <johnbender> Wilto: no where
[14:40:08] <johnbender> or a branch :D
[14:40:22] * Wilto deletes everything, cue frowny-face
[14:40:28] <gseguin> Wilto: post 1.1 as in 1.2 ? branch
[14:40:54] <Wilto> Well, we’re gonna stay on master, yeah? And do 1.1-stable, I assume?
[14:41:15] <gseguin> only once we release 1.1 final
[14:41:29] <gseguin> at least that was the plan as of last night
[14:41:30] <johnbender> Wilto: there were two way to approach it, that was the other way
[14:41:33] <Wilto> Alright, no sense making a stopgap branch then, yeah?
[14:41:42] <Wilto> I’ll just stash this stuff for after 1.1 final.
[14:41:58] <gseguin> you can create a branch, branch are cheap
[14:41:59] <johnbender> Wilto: if you want to work on a featuree just branch and we'll merge it into master after we create a stable branch
[14:42:15] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, feature-specific branch.
[14:42:18] <johnbender> yessir
[14:42:28] <Wilto> This is what happens when way too much morning caffeine wears off.
[14:44:30] <johnbender> Wilto: that checkboxradio issue is weird
[14:44:35] <johnbender> it's not that elements aren't getting checked
[14:44:46] <johnbender> for some reason the form submit just isn't sending it along
[14:44:53] <johnbender> well
[14:44:54] <Wilto> Alright, I was hoping it wasn’t just me stumped.
[14:45:09] <johnbender> I haven't excluded that checked issue yet entirely
[14:45:19] <Wilto> I mean, I know the underlying elements were being checked, when we sorted this stuff out last time.

[14:50:14] <gseguin> jrburke: ping
[14:58:30] <gseguin> tbenzige: TR operates only on the non-optimized CSS, right?
[15:00:24] <tbenzige> yes
[15:00:33] <gseguin> thanks
[15:01:21] <jrburke> gseguin: back now
[15:01:43] <gseguin> hey jrburke I was about to submit a PR for r.js
[15:01:57] <gseguin> I want to be able to consolidate css imports
[15:02:02] <gseguin> and that's it
[15:02:16] <gseguin> I don't want to strip comments
[15:02:38] <gseguin> and unless I misread the code there is no way to do that with r.js, is there?
[15:03:41] <jrburke> gseguin: right that is not possible right now, comment removal always happens. do you want to just keep license comments or all comments?
[15:04:08] <gseguin> all comments, I just want to resolve the imports
[15:04:20] <johnbender> Wilto: 8da75eb6b5de0d283e2061347f2575c240d32fce
[15:04:26] <johnbender> Wilto: bisect shows the way
[15:04:50] <johnbender> though I know you made that change for a reason
[15:04:53] <jrburke> gseguin: ok yeah there is a ticket open about preserving license comments, but yeah if you want full comment retention, then yes that would require a code change
[15:05:16] <gseguin> jrburke: submitting a PR as we speak
[15:05:24] <jrburke> gseguin: ok
[15:05:38] <jrburke> will follow up in that PR
[15:05:40] <Wilto> I mean, I made that change for the reason in the new issue.
[15:05:47] <Wilto> Which is why I’m stumped, here.
[15:05:55] <gseguin> thank you jrburke
[15:06:04] <Wilto> The underlying elements weren’t getting checked, so I hammered that out to ensure they were.
[15:06:14] <Wilto> Now they’re getting checked, but not included in oh hell I get it.
[15:06:18] <Wilto> Maybe.
[15:06:56] <Wilto> Okay.
[15:07:04] <Wilto> It’s this new attr/prop reference stuff.
[15:07:24] <Wilto> It’s not showing up to the form submit binding because it’s not “checked” as far as jQuery knows.
[15:07:36] <johnbender> Wilto: well, as far as the browser knows
[15:07:44] <johnbender> the form is data-ajax false
[15:07:47] <Wilto> They’re referencing the jQ object for stuff now, yeah? Not re-checking the DOM?
[15:07:49] <johnbender> in the issue sample
[15:07:58] <johnbender> Wilto: no idea
[15:08:13] <johnbender> Wilto: I though in the case of prop it was foo["prop"] = "value"
[15:08:24] <johnbender> that is an object property
[15:08:40] <Wilto> Yeah, okay, this makes sense.
[15:09:31] <gseguin> tbenzige: you also said that you don't care for the structure css, is that right?
[15:09:56] <gseguin> do you want a separate jquery.mobile.default.theme.js
[15:09:58] <gseguin> ?
[15:10:36] <gseguin> the same way we provide jquery.mobile.structure.css ?
[15:11:50] <johnbender> Wilto: so reverting that that commit appears to behave properly but the checkbox tests fail
[15:12:25] <Wilto> But the underlying elements are actually being checked/unchecked?
[15:15:00] <johnbender> Wilto: yah according to the form submit
[15:15:06] <johnbender> working on the tests now
[15:15:08] <Wilto> …Huh.
[15:21:34] <tbenzige> gseguin: i do need the structure as well as the theme file, but i need them separate
[15:21:42] <tbenzige> so yes, a cdn-hosted theme file would be perfect
[15:22:32] <gseguin> so does jquery.mobile.css need to have the comments after I make jquery.mobile.theme.css happen ?
[15:22:37] <johnbender> Wilto: I've got it working
[15:23:11] <johnbender> I'm going to push this change to a branch and maybe you can take a run through?
[15:23:21] <johnbender> I feel like this deserves some testin
[15:23:45] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm going to add a test for the form submission issue
[15:24:22] <tbenzige> gseguin: i guess not. the important thing to understand is that TR needs the comments for parsing, so in some respects the comments will always need to be in the un-minified CSS. but for my purposes I don't need an all-in-one jqm css file at all
[15:25:45] <gseguin> tbenzige: ok

[16:21:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/3670-fix] test that form submission includes radio checks - John Bender
[16:22:34] <Wilto> I’ll hit that branch with a fine-toothed comb in the morning, just to be sure. I can’t imagine there will be any browser-to-browser weirdness, though.
[16:23:46] <johnbender> Wilto: same, just wondering what corner cases the tests aren't covering
[16:23:49] <johnbender> :(
[16:24:15] <Wilto> Yeah; the whole issue just seems bizarre.
[16:25:25] <johnbender> Wilto: adding another test for checkboxes and forms
[16:25:27] <johnbender> just to be sure

[16:38:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/3670-fix] added checkbox test for form submission values - John Bender
[16:42:29] <johnbender> Wilto: well this is why we do rcs
[16:42:30] <johnbender> RCs
[16:42:48] <Wilto> True that. This is a big one.
[16:44:47] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm going to merge and ask the guy to test
[16:44:59] <johnbender> my testing shows that everything is working as normal
[16:45:27] <Wilto> Alright, cool. I’m sure that’ll be fine across the gadgets—this is a Core thing, not a browser thing.
