[12:22:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am around
[12:23:13] <agcolom> Hi! How are you?
[12:23:41] <uGoMobi> I am fine, thanks
[12:23:44] <agcolom> How's your work going?
[12:23:50] <uGoMobi> and you?
[12:24:06] <agcolom> Good... I'm recovering! (Hurt my back on monday)
[12:24:43] <uGoMobi> work is going ok, but still bit behind :(
[12:25:00] <uGoMobi> good to hear your back is getting better
[12:25:17] <agcolom> I've finally worked out the right amount of medicine to take!
[12:25:34] <agcolom> It's half of what I was told to take! I was getting hallucinations!!!!
[12:25:45] <uGoMobi> oh no
[12:25:52] <agcolom> And feeling very drunk!
[12:26:07] <agcolom> but was not drinking anything!
[12:26:13] <uGoMobi> yeah those pain killers can be heavy stuff
[12:26:19] <agcolom> Seriously!
[12:26:43] <agcolom> I was seeing my daughter in the bathroom, when actually it was a towell!
[12:26:51] <uGoMobi> wtf
[12:26:51] <agcolom> And there was rain on hte walls!
[12:27:15] <agcolom> Quite interesting!
[12:27:19] <uGoMobi> sound like you have been on a trip ;)
[12:27:58] <agcolom> Yeah! Was quite scary, because I thought I might start seeing monsters!
[12:28:33] <uGoMobi> got London Zoo at your house all of a sudden
[12:28:35] <uGoMobi> :D
[12:28:41] <uGoMobi> whoehoe
[12:29:29] <agcolom> So I cut the dose to half, and that's just right! Also I think I'm a bit more used to it now, so the side effect are not so bad anymore!
[12:30:37] <agcolom> Are you doing anything interesting for your work at the moment?
[12:30:58] <uGoMobi> when you dont feel the pain in your back anymore at all you might do things you actually shouldn't to give a chance to recover
[12:31:13] <uGoMobi> so, never good to take too much medication
[12:31:23] <agcolom> yes, that's true!
[12:32:22] <uGoMobi> I am still working on my JQM WordPress framework/theme
[12:33:00] <agcolom> got some feedback from SF, Seems that toddmparker_'s talk went well... Unfortunately he didn't have time for live demos but he had screenshots of everything... so that's good.
[12:33:07] <uGoMobi> and there have two clients for that already, while my framework isn't ready yet
[12:33:08] <agcolom> Oh, nice!
[12:33:35] <agcolom> So is that what you're doing tomorrow? (and tonight?)
[12:33:36] <uGoMobi> yeah, I saw it here on IRC... had a look at his presentation
[12:33:47] <toddmparker_> hey uGoMobi and agcolom
[12:33:58] <agcolom> hey toddmparker!
[12:34:03] <toddmparker_> how goes
[12:34:03] <agcolom> where are you?
[12:34:09] <uGoMobi> yeah, didn't do much today yet
[12:34:11] <toddmparker_> we're having a big jQuery meeting today
[12:34:14] <uGoMobi> was nice summer day
[12:34:19] <toddmparker_> on San Francisco
[12:34:24] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker_
[12:34:28] <agcolom> Excellent!
[12:34:49] <uGoMobi> how was the conference?
[12:35:11] <agcolom> is gseguin with you as well?
[12:35:34] <gseguin> yeah I an
[12:35:36] <gseguin> am
[12:35:39] <agcolom> Cool!
[12:35:43] <uGoMobi> hi gseguin
[12:35:49] <agcolom> and johnbender?
[12:35:58] <gseguin> hey Jasper
[12:36:04] <agcolom> Lots of tweets about johnbender's talk!
[12:36:07] <uGoMobi> johnbender: how did you talk go?
[12:36:38] <gseguin> went great
[12:36:42] <gseguin> he rocked it
[12:36:46] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[12:37:39] <agcolom> toddmparker_ 8th widget nearly ready!
[12:39:21] <toddmparker_> nice agcolom
[12:39:33] <toddmparker_> rocked it? maybe not
[12:39:41] <toddmparker_> oh, thought you were talkign about me
[12:39:47] <toddmparker_> bender did rock it
[12:39:56] <toddmparker_> dropped some serious theory
[12:40:10] <agcolom> toddmparker_ gsegiun, if Karl Swedberg is with you, please say big thanks from me. The changes in the api docs are thanks to him!
[12:45:04] <toddmparker_> he's not, but he's great, right?
[12:46:02] <toddmparker_> agcolom: on the widget docs, we should probably add a section that covers the enhanced markup like ui
[12:46:52] <toddmparker_> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[12:46:58] <toddmparker_> see the theming tab
[12:50:37] <agcolom> yes, that's a good idea...
[12:59:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: what kind of fixes do we still cherry-pick into 1.1-stable now RC1 is out?
[12:59:55] <toddmparker_> I'd like to note any fixes for 1.1.2, but not really touch 1.1.1 unless there is a big issue.
[13:00:14] <agcolom> uGoMobi, I think we don't know yet where we are going to cherry-pick into.
[13:00:19] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:00:56] <agcolom> So you need to make a note of what needs to be cherry-picked (for yourself) so that when we know, we can cherry-pick. Is that right gseguin?
[13:01:44] <gseguin> johnbender: that is correct
[13:01:55] <gseguin> 1.1-stable is frozen for now
[13:02:19] <gseguin> use a comment like [1.1.2]
[13:02:35] <gseguin> when you commit to master
[13:02:37] <uGoMobi> ok, will comment at the commit
[13:02:56] <agcolom> I've made changes in master but didn't use that comment, but I have a doc with all the commits that need cherry-picking
[13:03:04] <uGoMobi> put it in the commit message you mean
[13:03:07] <agcolom> is that ok gseguin?
[13:03:40] <gseguin> yeah commit message is cool
[13:03:54] <gseguin> so you can grep for it when doing git log
[13:03:54] <uGoMobi> sure, will do

[13:27:40] <jzaefferer> updating jenkins job...
[13:30:24] <agcolom> toddmparker_ if you're with everyone, could you please ask for the api docs quick access CDN at the bottom to be updated (currently says //code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.min.js)
[13:33:00] <agcolom> (I think we want 1.7.1)
[13:37:06] <jzaefferer> agcolom: code for that footer is here: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/themes/jquery/footer-mobile.php
[13:37:20] <jzaefferer> would you send a PR for that?
[13:37:42] <jzaefferer> should be jQuery 1.7.2
[13:40:03] <agcolom> jzaefferer, ok, thanks. Actually we're still on 1.7.1 for jQuery Mobile. toddmparker_ is this correct?
[13:40:49] <jzaefferer> really?
[13:40:55] <jzaefferer> 1.7.2 was released in March: http://blog.jquery.com/2012/03/21/jquery-1-7-2-released/
[13:41:54] <agcolom> toddmparker_ and gseguin ^^ we're still on 1.7.1 right?
[13:42:30] <agcolom> jzaefferer are Todd and Ghislain still with you?
[13:42:42] <jzaefferer> agcolom: Todd is here, apparently ignoring irc ;)
[13:42:49] <agcolom> :-(
[13:42:51] <kborchers> yes 1.7.1 http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/04/13/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-1-0/
[13:42:53] <gseguin> yeah we're still on 1.7.1
[13:43:18] <gseguin> jzaefferer: you should be paying attention to the meeting ;)
[13:44:37] <agcolom> ok, let me know when your meeting is finished and I can ask questions :-)
[13:45:27] <toddmparker_> heh
[13:45:29] <toddmparker_> i'm here
[13:45:30] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #252: FAILURE in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/252/
[13:46:05] <agcolom> jzaefferer can I edit the footer directly? Or you prefer if I do a PR?
[13:46:22] <jzaefferer> agcolom: do you have write access to web-base-template?
[13:46:41] <toddmparker_> i should add an issue to Upgrade master to 1.7.2
[13:47:53] <agcolom> jzaefferer  not sure... but it looks like I have
[13:48:56] <jzaefferer> then just go ahead and fix it
[13:48:58] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4631
[13:48:58] <socialhapy> â Issue #4631 on jquery-mobile (toddparker; 15.282s ago): Upgrade master to 1.7.2
[13:49:20] <agcolom> jzaefferer cool, Thanks! Will do that now.
[13:50:54] <agcolom> done
[13:54:07] <jzaefferer> agcolom toddmparker_: on jQuery UI we always prefix commit messages to make it clear what the commit affects. That makes it easy to figure out what a commit is about
[13:54:20] <jzaefferer> in this case, the prefix could've been "Mobile theme: ..."
[13:54:39] <jzaefferer> with all the docs commits on jquery/jquery-mobile recently, the prefix could've been "Docs: "
[13:55:07] <jzaefferer> you should consider putting that in the readme or something and having all commiters adopt that
[13:55:23] <jzaefferer> and also asking contributors (via PRs) to follow that
[13:56:02] <agcolom> jzaefferer: sure. Will do that from now.
[13:56:18] <toddmparker_> i like that idea jzaefferer
[13:56:36] <toddmparker_> this would help with creating change logs
[13:56:48] <jzaefferer> also encourages to not mix changes to ten unrelated components in a single commit
[13:56:52] <jzaefferer> that, too
[13:57:07] <jzaefferer> do you already use the "â¦ - fixed #123"?
[13:57:19] <agcolom> yes
[13:58:29] <toddmparker_> and commits are generally very well defined and focsued
[13:58:38] <toddmparker_> but the prefix is nice
[13:58:50] <toddmparker_> i've been doing that in the blog posts as of 1.1.1
[13:59:05] <toddmparker_> really, i want to group commits by widget

[14:04:53] <jzaefferer> gah, apparently I broke Jenkins by cancelling a job: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/253/console - and of course that broken job can't be cancelled m(
[14:07:20] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: want me to hold commits, until you are done with Jenkins?
[14:08:10] <toddmparker_> jzaefferer stepped away, fyi
[14:09:50] <uGoMobi> thanks todd
[14:10:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: are you changing the readme now?
[14:10:40] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: shouldn't be necessary
[14:10:55] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: ok, thanks
[14:10:59] <jzaefferer> looks like that job timed out, so all good
[14:11:22] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes
[14:11:49] <jzaefferer> five tests passed in Chrome, its a start: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/119
[14:11:55] <jzaefferer> dunno what Firefox is doing there...
[14:12:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: nevermind, jzaefferer already said it shouldn't be necessary to hold commits

[14:14:04] <agcolom> yes, I need to make a phone call... will be back.. I'm half way throught the readme change...
[14:14:07] <uGoMobi> cool
[14:14:13] <jzaefferer> can't run iPhone yet, as our useragent parser detects it, at least the iOS simulator version, as Safari 5.1
[14:14:19] <uGoMobi> nice UI btw
[14:22:29] <jzaefferer> it looks to me like Mobile's testsuite needs a lot of cleanup before we can deploy this at full scale
[14:22:40] <jzaefferer> why would the button testsuite make ajax requests??
[14:23:26] <jzaefferer> also that single page makes 67 requests - isn't the /js thingie supposed to reduce that heavily?
[14:23:43] <jzaefferer> fixing things like that would also speed up the phantomjs job

[14:34:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: maybe you should ask them to show you "the making of" as well

[14:40:17] <jzaefferer> toddmparker_: from here I'll wait for John's input before moving ahead, while working with Krinkle to fix the useragent parsing, so that we can actually test against mobile browsers
