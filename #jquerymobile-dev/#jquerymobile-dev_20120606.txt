[06:41:59] <agcolom> Hi everyone, just a quick reminder that there is a post on basecamp regarding dialogs.... If someone could give me some answers that would be really good. Thank you.
[07:39:14] <toddparker> morning
[07:39:27] <toddparker> this is kind of a cool hack to make a dual handle slider
[07:39:28] <toddparker> http://jsfiddle.net/NkjQr/12/
[07:39:43] <toddparker> might be worth cleaning this up as an example for the docs
[07:39:58] <toddparker> maybe even support this as a new type down the road
[07:40:06] <toddparker> uGoMobi ^^
[07:40:12] <toddparker> might be a fun project for you
[07:40:21] <toddparker> be cool if the range fill worked
[07:40:38] <uGoMobi> toddparker: cool will have a look
[07:40:58] <uGoMobi> together with the vertical slider ;-)
[07:41:43] <Dragooon> Has there been any noticible speed improvements since the release of 1.1?
[07:42:11] <toddparker> YES uGoMobi
[07:42:16] <toddparker> both would be hawt
[07:42:28] <toddparker> (hot with a boston accent)
[07:42:37] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:42:49] <toddparker> Dragooon: i don't think so, but we've made a ton of fixes and tweaks
[07:42:58] <toddparker> does something seem faster?
[07:43:02] <Dragooon> Any new features (too many commits)
[07:43:04] <Dragooon> No I'm curious
[07:43:12] <Dragooon> I'll be merging the git into my fork later
[07:43:15] <toddparker> master is 1.2-pre
[07:43:23] <Dragooon> I know
[07:43:26] <toddparker> the biggest new thing is the popup widget
[07:43:32] <Dragooon> Yes!
[07:43:58] <toddparker> if you want to just grab the 1.1.1 fixes, grab the 1.1-stable branch
[07:44:26] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[07:44:29] <Dragooon> I've been using git master since 4 months :D
[07:44:32] <toddparker> ^^ popup demo & docs
[07:44:34] <Dragooon> but haven't merged laetly
[07:44:36] <Dragooon> lately*
[07:44:37] <toddparker> ah, ok
[07:44:39] <Dragooon> yeah, just opened those
[07:45:02] <uGoMobi> toddparker: +1 for dual handle slider... will have a look at fill later (after 1.1.1 issues)
[07:45:23] <toddparker> sure
[07:45:33] <toddparker> seems pretty lightweight based on that fiddle
[07:45:35] <uGoMobi> talking about the slider...
[07:45:44] <uGoMobi> was looking into forms in header/footer
[07:45:54] <uGoMobi> slider, flip toggle controlgroup are all broken
[07:45:58] <toddparker> right
[07:46:04] <toddparker> really?
[07:46:19] <uGoMobi> because of inline-block rule for buttons in header/footer
[07:46:22] <toddparker> are they only messed up if IN a control group in a toolbar?
[07:46:28] <toddparker> we tested those quite a bit for 1.1
[07:46:29] <uGoMobi> no
[07:46:34] <toddparker> ah
[07:46:47] <uGoMobi> slider and flip toggle AND (vertical) controlgroup
[07:46:52] <toddparker> that is a bad one.
[07:47:14] <uGoMobi> i m working on it now
[07:47:20] <toddparker> the vertical control group is less of a concern but the others are important to fix up
[07:47:25] <toddparker> great!
[07:47:37] <uGoMobi> yes i agree... wont use controlgroup in toolbar
[07:47:49] <toddparker> at least not the vertical one. horiz for sure
[07:48:06] <toddparker> once you're done with that, i'd like your styling help on popups
[07:48:10] <uGoMobi> yeah thats what i meant, but horizontal is not an issue
[07:48:20] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:48:30] <toddparker> so nice to be back in IRC. no internet for more than a day at the office. bad.
[07:48:38] <toddparker> right, that's good anyway
[07:48:42] <uGoMobi> haha yeah i saw that
[07:48:51] <toddparker> did I miss anything important?
[07:48:55] <uGoMobi> i was thinking...
[07:49:23] <uGoMobi> quick fix for slider and flip toggle issue is only apply inline-block for buttons that are direct children
[07:49:32] <uGoMobi> then they are ok
[07:49:44] <uGoMobi> we can do that for 1.1.1 and look at def solution later
[07:50:05] <uGoMobi> cos we have updatePagePadding issue to solve too
[07:50:31] <toddparker> sounds like a good plan
[07:50:38] <toddparker> yes we do
[07:50:43] <uGoMobi> no nothing important that was not on basecamp
[07:50:50] <toddparker> scott jehl is in the office if you need him to consult
[07:50:54] <toddparker> cool
[07:51:01] <toddparker> so happy to clear out all the dead branches
[07:51:11] <uGoMobi> i will make the PR for buttons and form today
[07:51:27] <uGoMobi> yeah feels like spring cleaning :-)
[07:52:00] <uGoMobi> last thing about forms in toolbars...
[07:52:20] <uGoMobi> make them default to mini and inline is an issue too
[07:52:38] <uGoMobi> have to change things in JS widgets
[07:53:06] <uGoMobi> gonna leave that for now as well but keep it on my list
[08:33:54] <gseguin> Good morning!
[08:36:00] <uGoMobi> good morning gseguin!
[08:55:23] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! *sigh* ... not having much luck with improving slider performance ... I tried introducing a lazy-update method ( so the input and the aria-attributes update at most every <delay> ms, but it didn't help noticably ...
[08:55:37] <_|Nix|_> s/ms/ms)
[08:55:44] <_|Nix|_> /say/
[08:55:46] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[08:55:49] <_|Nix|_> /
[08:57:04] <_|Nix|_> Some webkit guy also told me to use css transforms instead of .offset({left: x, top: y}), because that isolates the element from relayouts, but I haven't been able to get magic-bullet-like improvement with that either - especially since it's not generic.
[08:57:42] <_|Nix|_> I'd like to try requestAnimationFrame(), but I don't know how well-supported that is, and whether we want to incorporate a fallback for it if it's absent ...
[09:44:20] <johnbender> toddparker: are you around?
[10:01:43] <johnbender> jzaefferer: you mentioned that there was a grunt init task for grunt plugins, did you mean the node init?
[10:02:04] <johnbender> I'm going to work on pulling the xml extension out into a plugin
[10:22:44] <johnbender> jzaefferer: ping ^
[10:55:42] <toddparker> hi johnbender
[10:55:51] <johnbender> toddparker: yo!
[10:55:53] <toddparker> i'm here, even if my internet isn't
[10:55:55] <johnbender> toddparker: lol
[10:56:13] <toddparker> been trying to be her win spirit
[10:56:15] <johnbender> toddparker: so I just wanted to make sure you know that when we decide to do another release/deploy I'll need a day heads up
[10:56:20] <toddparker> here in spirit
[10:56:34] <toddparker> ok, that's no problem
[10:56:39] <johnbender> toddparker: just to make sure that the build changes I've made since the last one give us a sane result
[10:56:52] <toddparker> we usually do a lot more more planning than 1 day anyway
[10:56:55] <toddparker> right
[10:57:06] <toddparker> i've liked the early test build procedure anyway
[10:57:07] <johnbender> toddparker: thats what I figured but I wanted to make sure anyhow
[10:57:22] <johnbender> toddparker: yah, put it out and make sure it's all good
[10:57:23] <toddparker> cool
[10:57:26] <toddparker> so how goes
[10:57:33] <toddparker> you still working on your presentation?
[10:57:39] <johnbender> toddparker: good, I'm pulling the junit stuff out at per the request from jorn
[10:57:45] <toddparker> kk
[10:57:46] <johnbender> toddparker: oh no, that was done last week
[10:57:47] <johnbender> went well
[10:57:57] <johnbender> toddparker: once I get this done I'll be back on PR's and issues
[10:57:59] <johnbender> focusing on PRs
[10:58:02] <toddparker> nice
[10:59:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/eFGMeQ
[10:59:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed builder metadata - Ghislain Seguin
[10:59:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Moved decouple event code into js/events directory - Ghislain Seguin
[11:01:53] <gseguin> I just pushed the move of events code to the js/events dir
[11:02:02] <gseguin> and the associated builder changes
[11:02:45] <gseguin> next I would like to move forms widgets in js/forms
[11:02:53] <gseguin> any objections?
[11:03:18] <gseguin> toddparker, johnbender, _|Nix|_ uGoMobi, Wilto: ^
[11:05:31] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I am working on PR that affects couple of JS widgets files :|
[11:05:58] <gseguin> uGoMobi: forms widgets?
[11:06:03] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:06:32] <uGoMobi> going to CSS files as well?
[11:06:40] <uGoMobi> to do*
[11:07:57] <gseguin> git usually handles that pretty well
[11:08:13] <gseguin> nope just taking care of js code right now
[11:10:52] <uGoMobi> ok, well not a big problem to start over...
[11:11:17] <uGoMobi> go ahead and i will pull again and make new branch
[11:11:55] <gseguin> uGoMobi: you can go ahead with your changes
[11:12:36] <uGoMobi> git keep track when you move to other folders?
[11:12:58] <gseguin> it's a rename, right?
[11:13:35] <uGoMobi> if you rename them the history will be lost
[11:14:27] <gseguin> not sure about that
[11:14:32] <uGoMobi> what happens if you move the files to folder (same file names)... can you still pull the branch from my fork?
[11:15:07] <uGoMobi> when I click history on github history goes back to where it says "file has been renamed"
[11:17:13] <gseguin> yeah so it keeps track of moves
[11:17:31] <uGoMobi> ok good
[11:18:12] <uGoMobi> but are you planning on renaming them as well? remove "forms" from the file name?
[11:20:47] <gseguin> yeah, I think that makes sense
[11:25:30] <uGoMobi> gseguin: here you can see what will happen with "history" https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/master/js/events/orientationchange.js
[11:25:54] <gseguin> yep I saw
[11:25:57] <uGoMobi> but "blame" still works so not a big issue
[11:28:10] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I just started with creating that PR and it is a pretty big one, so I think I better start over again when you are ready
[11:30:05] <uGoMobi> gseguin: can you let me know when you are done?
[11:31:00] <gseguin> I'd like to get johnbender, scottjehl or toddparker to bless the events changes to make sure it was what everyone was expecting
[11:31:24] <gseguin> so go ahead uGoMobi with your changes
[11:32:03] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok, will try to finish it today
[11:33:38] <johnbender> gseguin: uGoMobi: what's the goal
[11:33:38] <johnbender> ?
[11:35:00] <gseguin> johnbender: code re-org
[11:35:09] <toddparker> gseguin: are the folder changes in a branch or master?
[11:35:16] <johnbender> gseguin: will that conflict with scott's work?
[11:35:16] <gseguin> master
[11:35:23] <toddparker> i can take a look
[11:35:37] <gseguin> johnbender: what is scott working on?
[11:35:43] <gseguin> which scott ?
[11:35:54] <toddparker> BTW - that WP7 theme article received 65,000 views. I wish we had good stats on jQM use
[11:36:41] <johnbender> gseguin: scott_gonzalez
[11:36:55] <gseguin> the decoupling thing?
[11:36:55] <uGoMobi> toddparker: what article is that?
[11:37:02] <johnbender> I thought he was working on something to do with touch
[11:37:14] <johnbender> toddparker: whoa
[11:37:30] <gseguin> it's done, he will just have to pick up the file from js/events instead of js
[11:38:38] <uGoMobi> johnbender: i was just asking gseguin if it will affect PR (standardize all buttons and form) that I am working on
[11:39:04] <johnbender> gseguin: ah so we're splitting it out then?
[11:39:21] <johnbender> that sounds like a great idea
[11:39:38] <gseguin> yeah I split events into smaller modules
[11:39:57] <gseguin> and validated the change with scott_gonzalez
[11:40:00] <johnbender> gseguin: so what is uGoMobi working on again?
[11:40:02] <johnbender> sorry
[11:40:07] * johnbender is dense
[11:40:22] <uGoMobi> tell him gseguin ;)
[11:40:37] <gseguin> johnbender: standardize all buttons and form
[11:40:42] <uGoMobi> hehe
[11:41:58] <gseguin>     did I get it right?
[11:42:13] <uGoMobi> yeah :-)
[11:42:26] <johnbender> ah, how are they different?
[11:42:33] <johnbender> just curious now
[11:43:04] <toddparker> article: http://aka.ms/db2zou
[11:43:30] <uGoMobi> johnbender:  look at this and then click current at the right top http://localhost/ugomobi.github.com/buttons-form/buttons-form-new.html
[11:43:43] <uGoMobi> you'll see the difference :-)
[11:43:59] <uGoMobi> (sorry didn't split up that heavy test page yet)
[11:44:00] <toddparker> so excited to have the events broken out
[11:44:04] <uGoMobi> thanks toddparker
[11:44:23] <toddparker> uGoMobi: that link is to localhost
[11:44:36] <uGoMobi> oh sorry
[11:44:42] <toddparker> i don't think i can reach your wifi network from here :p
[11:44:47] <uGoMobi> stupid me... have to push again
[11:45:01] <uGoMobi> not with your broken internet ;-)
[11:45:16] <uGoMobi> nevermind... you will see in couple of hours
[11:45:38] <uGoMobi> will break up that page first
[11:45:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: totally cool
[11:46:12] <gseguin> Argh: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[11:46:18] <uGoMobi> i never liked any design or style thing from microsoft until the WP Metro style
[11:46:19] <gseguin> builder is broken
[11:46:24] <gseguin> looking into it
[11:46:38] <johnbender> gseguin: nested callbacks much :D
[11:46:43] * johnbender is taking his pot shots
[11:49:55] <uGoMobi> toddparker:that WP7 theme is very cool!
[13:38:01] <johnbender> toddparker: re those numbers
[13:38:05] <johnbender> _whoa_
[13:39:48] <johnbender> toddparker: also, we need to get an affiliate account set up for those book links to amazon
[13:39:56] <johnbender> could be earning the project some cash
[13:40:02] <johnbender> unless you already have
[13:52:26] <uGoMobi> gseguin: a minor minor minor detail request since you are going to rename anyway... can you change fieldContain.js into fieldcontain.js (all lowercase) so it's the same as the css file
[13:52:37] <toddparker> heh, i need to see if there is a jQ amazon affiliate
[13:53:59] <uGoMobi> gseguin: also... for CSS it is mobile.button.css but for JS it is mobile.forms.button.js (do we consider it as part of forms or not?)
[13:55:33] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ok
[13:55:57] <uGoMobi> thanks
[13:56:03] <gseguin> uGoMobi: that's a good question
[13:56:26] <agcolom> Good evening :-)
[13:56:27] <gseguin> I guess button is part of forms
[13:56:35] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[13:56:35] <gseguin> whereas buttonMarkup is not
[13:56:39] <gseguin> hi Anne
[13:56:46] <agcolom> Hi :-)
[13:56:48] <uGoMobi> yes i agree
[13:59:20] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I see more JS file with a capital in it... would be nice if it is consistent with css file naming
[13:59:29] <uGoMobi> just to prevent mistakes
[14:00:21] <gseguin> either way but it should be consistent
[14:00:30] <uGoMobi> yup
[14:02:02] <agcolom> Just looked at the stats toddparker just sent and that is looking pretty amazing to me!
[14:03:53] <uGoMobi> which stats do you have?
[14:04:12] <uGoMobi> of the docs?
[14:04:27] <agcolom> the email sent on basecamp
[14:04:51] <uGoMobi> ah thanks, see it now
[14:05:11] <agcolom> 14m views, 10m unique in just over a year and a half!
[14:07:19] <uGoMobi> really cool
[14:13:26] <uGoMobi> how long ago has jQuery UI been launched?
[14:13:43] <agcolom> Jasper, do you have any idea on how to get the data-close-btn-text option to work (to specify close button text on dialogs). I tried and I wonder how to get it to work... docs: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html and I also tried several things: http://jsfiddle.net/agcolom/NgdSC/12/
[14:14:11] <agcolom> UI or Mobile?
[14:14:51] <uGoMobi> UI
[14:15:10] <uGoMobi> just curious ... for comparison
[14:15:50] <agcolom> I don't know. toddparker should know...
[14:16:23] <toddparker> UI been around for maybe 4 years-ish
[14:16:35] <uGoMobi> ah, thanks
[14:17:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: will have a look at the close button
[14:17:58] <agcolom> thanks ;-)
[14:22:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: this is a funny option
[14:22:57] <uGoMobi> you can set the text like you did and you can see it when you use code inspector
[14:23:19] <uGoMobi> but the function in the JS adds iconpos='notext' to the button
[14:23:32] <uGoMobi> so you will never see it
[14:26:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] agcolom pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/u5bgZQ
[14:26:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed unnecessary line breaks and empty lines - Chetan K Jain
[14:26:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #4491 from chetankjain/patch-23 - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[14:27:12] <agcolom> ah, do we need to add a button then to see it?
[14:27:57] <uGoMobi> no, the button is there but the text is hidden by default
[14:28:25] <uGoMobi> i think this is a mistake
[14:29:24] <agcolom> ok, I get it...
[14:30:29] <agcolom> And with an additional option to give text position, would that override the iconpos=notext?
[14:31:06] <uGoMobi> not the way the function is written now... notext is hardcoded
[14:31:49] <uGoMobi> i think we should change it into... hide text if it is the default "close" text but make text visible when user set the text
[14:31:55] <uGoMobi> if you know what i mean :-)
[14:34:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/ORLxOg
[14:34:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Merge pull request #4491 from chetankjain/patch-23 - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[14:34:37] <agcolom> yes :-)
[14:37:28] <agcolom> johnbender, gseguin, there is something weird with the data-close-btn-text option (to specify close button text on dialogs).  docs: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html  uGoMobi had a look as well and our conclusions are that it seems that the button text can be set but the text is hidden (iconpos="notext")
[14:38:14] <uGoMobi> headerCloseButton = $( "<a href='#' data-" + $.mobile.ns + "icon='delete' data-" + $.mobile.ns + "iconpos='notext'>"+ this.options.closeBtnText + "</a>" ),
[14:39:27] <uGoMobi> still nice for screen readers :-)
[14:40:06] <agcolom> yes, that's a good point !
[14:41:52] <johnbender> looking
[14:41:52] <toddparker> yep, that's what it's for
[14:42:23] <toddparker> even though we use the icon only button, we need it to have a text node that means something for screenreaders
[14:42:57] <toddparker> tho i do like the approach on popups where we can ask people to add the markup themselves
[14:43:04] <toddparker> i don't like having JS write markup
[14:43:29] <toddparker> because you need to either have a templating language or have JS options for each little thing
[14:43:42] <agcolom> Ok, so if that what it's for, then I'll add a note to the docs, because I was expecting that it was possible to see that text on the screen....
[14:43:42] <toddparker> text, position, icon, etc. = yuck
[14:44:03] <toddparker> yep, seems to work as designed (maybe not as expected)
[14:45:19] <agcolom> yes, i think a note to specify that it is for screen readers will be sufficient to make it clear...
[14:46:54] <toddparker> cool
[14:47:01] <toddparker> how goes it?
[14:50:17] <agcolom> something like: Just like the page plugin, you can set a dialog's close button text through an option or data attribute. Note that this option is for accessibility purposes and the text will not be displayed on the screen, as the iconpos option is set to notext.
[14:51:16] <toddparker> sure
[14:51:23] <toddparker> and I18n
[14:51:37] <toddparker> cerrado
[14:51:41] <agcolom> what is that?
[14:52:22] <toddparker> internationalization
[14:52:45] <agcolom> ah! should I mention that as well?
[14:52:50] <toddparker> yes
[14:53:15] <uGoMobi> nice for Wordfreud ;-)
[14:53:55] <toddparker> yeah, pretty much any text in JS needs to be a variable so it can be translated
[14:53:57] <agcolom> Note that this option is for accessibility and internationalization purposes and the text set using this option will not be displayed on the screen, as the iconpos option is set to notext. ?
[14:55:06] <agcolom> uGoMobi, is there a default value for this option?
[14:55:13] <agcolom> (is it close?)
[14:55:16] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:55:22] <agcolom> close?
[14:55:25] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:55:27] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:55:34] <agcolom> great thanks a lot
[14:55:38] <uGoMobi> "Close" it is
[14:56:21] <agcolom> "Close" great. I needed to know that as well. Thanks a lot. toddparker, is the second version ok to add?
[15:00:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you take in consideration in which order components appear in the docs or just look at it as standalone parts?
[15:00:24] <toddparker> This option is used to customize the text of the close button which is helpful for translating this into different languages. This is an displayed as icon-only button by default so the text isn't visible on-screen, but is read by screen readers so this is an important accessibility feature.
[15:01:00] <agcolom> Perfect :-) Thank you! Will add that now...
[15:02:12] <agcolom> uGoMobi I was asked to start with dialog because there is a jQuery UI version also, so I have something I can compare it with to get started....
[15:02:25] <toddparker> gotcha
[15:02:30] <agcolom> Then I plan on going in the order of the docs.
[15:03:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: my question is not relevant anymore with Todd's text... I was thinking about dialog info comes before buttons so I havent read about iconpos etc yet
[15:03:55] <agcolom> ah, sorry, I thought you were talking about the XML docs thing
[15:04:09] <agcolom> uGoMobi ^
[15:04:13] <uGoMobi> yes i was
[15:04:40] <agcolom> ok,
[15:04:57] <uGoMobi> but maybe i dont understand yet what that project exactly means
[15:05:45] <agcolom> It is to get a version of our docs to be standard with jQuery UI and jQuery core docs.
[15:06:05] <agcolom> so all the docs is written in XML...
[15:06:18] <toddparker> agcolom: i don't think ties API docs need to be done by the conference
[15:06:22] <toddparker> that is a huge undertaking
[15:06:43] <toddparker> is that what richard said?
[15:06:46] <agcolom> ah!
[15:07:02] <toddparker> they are trying to launch the new jQuery sites for that
[15:07:04] <agcolom> well I understood it would be presented at the conf if it was ready
[15:07:19] <toddparker> we can announce we're working on it and show something if we can
[15:07:35] <toddparker> i might need your help on porting the old jQM site to the new template
[15:07:46] <toddparker> i'd rather do that for the conference so we're in sync
[15:07:54] <toddparker> did he talk to you about that?
[15:08:05] <toddparker> we went over it with me but i'm not yet set up
[15:08:26] <agcolom> I am setup and I have nearly finished dalog
[15:08:46] <agcolom> but I need some info on events and methods
[15:09:15] <agcolom> so I think gseguin and johnbender will have a look at my basecamp post to answer these questions...
[15:09:50] <agcolom> Richard made a change yesterday and I can no longer deploy (using grunt deploy)
[15:10:05] <agcolom> I have an error... so I sent him a an email this morning...
[15:10:16] * gseguin is burried under a stack of calls
[15:22:35] <johnbender> agcolom: I didn't add a grunt deploy task
[15:22:47] <johnbender> agcolom: do you mean `make deploy`?
[15:24:41] <agcolom> it's on the other project
[15:24:53] <johnbender> ah
[15:24:55] <johnbender> the docs project
[15:24:57] <johnbender> good to know
[15:25:04] <agcolom> yes

[16:02:29] <gseguin> johnbender: grrrr
[16:02:39] <johnbender> gseguin: what?
[16:02:43] <johnbender> did I do something?
[16:02:54] <gseguin> you created a circular dep in loader
[16:02:58] * johnbender ?
[16:03:04] <johnbender> ahh
[16:03:09] <gseguin> that's why I'm having a stack overflow
[16:03:22] <johnbender> the last time I mucked with that was ....
[16:03:28] <johnbender> a month ago
[16:03:33] <gseguin> that's ok though that showed a flaw in my code
[16:03:40] <johnbender> gseguin: sorry guy :(
[16:03:45] <gseguin> no worries
[16:03:58] <gseguin> I'm glad I finally was able to find itf
[16:04:01] <gseguin> it

[16:59:12] <gseguin> johnbender: is the grunt build using requirejs?
[16:59:23] <gseguin> or just concatenating?
[17:35:33] <gseguin> toddparker: much better results with the builderf
[17:35:37] <gseguin> builder
[20:39:59] <johnbender> gseguin: require
[20:40:15] <gseguin> johnbender: what?
[20:40:20] <gseguin> oh
[20:40:22] <gseguin> yeah
[20:40:24] <gseguin> ok
[20:40:26] <gseguin> thanks
[20:40:34] <johnbender> gseguin: it was super easy
[20:40:37] <gseguin> I figured after looking into ot
[20:40:45] <gseguin> good
[20:40:47] <johnbender> gseguin: I did that the first time around
[20:41:04] <gseguin> btw is that circular dep intentional ?
[20:41:31] <gseguin> like does loader depend on init?
[20:43:59] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[20:44:36] <johnbender> gseguin: hrm
[20:44:40] <johnbender> gseguin: not sure
[20:44:46] <johnbender> gseguin: it did during my refactor
[20:44:54] <johnbender> but I pulled bits out
[20:44:56] <johnbender> let me look
[20:45:03] <gseguin> it seems to run fine without it
[20:45:43] <johnbender> gseguin: yah take it out
[20:45:56] <gseguin> alright, done!

[20:59:41] <johnbender> it's not super future proof but it'll work for now

[21:08:56] <gseguin> did I do that?
[21:09:15] <johnbender> it was a blip
[21:09:19] <johnbender> the unstable
[21:11:24] <gseguin> I don't know man, http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/83/changes seems to say that I fixed it... I'll take credit for it ;)
