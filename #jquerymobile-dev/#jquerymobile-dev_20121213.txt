[00:00:56] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Hi, Jasper
[00:01:07] <uGoMobi> morning Changsuk 
[00:01:22] <uGoMobi> good afternoon I should say
[00:01:44] <Changsuk> ha ha... yes, yu're right. :)
[00:02:09] <Changsuk> Is it morning there?
[00:03:53] <Changsuk> I emailed Todd today with available chatting time.
[00:04:52] <Changsuk> 2 members in my team will be here tomorrow around 9:00 am (KST)
[00:05:01] <Changsuk> including me. :)
[00:05:47] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: yes, 9am here now
[00:06:12] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: ok, good to have you and your team here
[00:06:45] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: ah ha, I see. it is 5:06 pm here. ;)
[00:07:56] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Your welcome, I'm also happy to meet you here.
[00:10:22] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: I think that the gap of time zone between us is 8 hours. right?
[00:11:17] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: so are yu able to join the tomorrow meeting at that time?
[00:11:52] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: I'm so sorry about the meeting time.
[00:13:40] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: 9am tomorrow means 1am tonight for me so I am not sure I can make it
[00:14:03] <Changsuk> Yes, I think so...

[00:17:19] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: You guys wouldn't happen to be working on web-ui-fw, would you?
[00:17:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[00:19:02] <Changsuk> anyway, yu are the first member in your team who i met so i feel very comfortable to know you here. :)
[00:19:53] <Changsuk> _Nix_: Do yu mean Tizen web-ui-fw?
[00:20:01] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Yes.
[00:21:04] <Changsuk> _Nix_: Yes, my team is working on Tizen open source project and developing web-ui-fw core modules and widgets.
[00:21:41] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Cool! I wrote the colour widgets among other things ...
[00:23:18] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: If you guys wanna help out, maybe we can better integrate web-ui-fw with jQuery Mobile.
[00:23:45] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: There's already a public repo here: https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw ...
[00:24:18] <Changsuk> Wow~! very nice to meet yu. :D. Aactually I read your message on this channel.
[00:24:22] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: If you guys don't already have commit access there, I can probably get you guys commit access, and we can work together on lining up web-ui-fw with jQuery Mobile.
[00:25:00] <Changsuk> Yes, right.
[00:25:10] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: We were talking the other day about adding a section to the jQuery Mobile documentation that lists third-party widget sets and other plugins.
[00:25:19] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: We could start with web-ui-fw.
[00:25:21] <Changsuk> So I contact Todd to talk about it.
[00:27:20] <Changsuk> _Nix_: and i'm wondering about whether Tizen widgets will be on jQM widget or 3rd-party widget.
[00:28:38] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I think the idea is that it will live as a 3rd-party widget library, and if it becomes really, really stable and well-tested across all the major platforms supported by jQM, then it might be added to jQM.
[00:28:39] <Changsuk> _Nix_: My team and SEC guys want that one or more Tizen widgets and core libraries will be on main stream not 3rd-party.
[00:29:03] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: For example, Todd wanted me to add popupwindow to jQM, and it became jQM's popup (available since 1.2.0).
[00:29:21] <Changsuk> Ok, I can understand.
[00:29:30] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: As a result, we'll probably want to update web-ui-fw to use jQM's popup instead of its own popupwindow.
[00:30:47] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I'm also thinking that we should adopt the jQM infrastructure - that is, no need to run make before the widgets are useful, use AMD modules, and other such things ...
[00:31:14] <Changsuk> Yes, I think that the case can be possible.
[00:31:57] <Changsuk> Yes, my team will do it with your team's guides.
[00:32:10] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: That's great!
[00:32:29] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: D'you guys have a repo somewhere where I can check out what you guys have done with web-ui-fw?
[00:33:09] <Changsuk> ha ha... your welcome.
[00:34:16] <Changsuk> My team is preparing to put some widgets on the jQM Github.
[00:34:31] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: OK, great!
[00:36:19] <Changsuk> After tomorrow meeting with Todd, If Todd and your team approve my uploading the widgets, my team will put it soon.
[00:37:21] <Changsuk> I'll talk with Todd and members in jQM project here around 9:00am (KST).
[00:38:36] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Gah! That's 02:00 my time ... well, I guess I can try to stick around ...
[00:38:37] <Changsuk> _Nix_: Are you able to join the meeting? I don't know your time zone.
[00:39:00] <Changsuk> _Nix_: Ah.... I'm so sorry.
[00:39:11] <_|Nix|_> NP. I'll try to make it.
[00:39:18] <Changsuk> Really?
[00:39:27] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I promise nothing :)
[00:39:39] <Changsuk> haha~ :)
[00:40:26] <Changsuk> _Nix_: I'm sorry I have to go out now to take dinner.
[00:40:37] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: NP. Nejoy your meal!

[09:00:37] <toddmparker> cool.
[09:01:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: question for you
[09:01:09] <bot-t> (6 hours 55 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender AFAICT, the reason why a new urlHistory entry is being created when returning from a dialog is this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/simple-nav-merge/js/navigation/navigate.js#L160
[09:01:10] <bot-t> (6 hours 54 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender That one catches the back button, even though the history.direct is supposed to handle back/forward below that if-block.
[09:02:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm just not clear why there's no state being popped when going back to that initial page
[09:03:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I was also wondering if there's a specific reason for not including a nav reset in the sequence test
[09:03:07] <johnbender> *test
[09:03:08] <johnbender> *tests
[09:09:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: with a reset I have 3 failures
[09:09:35] <johnbender> but I still need to address that original issue
[09:13:01] <toddmparker> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_ 
[09:13:16] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker 
[09:13:20] <toddmparker> arschmitz, johnbender, agcolom, gseguin|away 
[09:13:27] <toddmparker> agenda for today - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A1PHMYUqXDBFCrL1i2Ey5AqdiBC3frKMhHPh7yBcQ6A/edit#
[09:13:31] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi, how goes?
[09:15:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: have been slowed down a bit by other work so working hard now to push some more demo stuff soon
[09:16:00] <toddmparker> ok, cool
[09:16:16] <toddmparker> for the grid lists, should we plan on that not even being a demo for 1.3?
[09:16:21] <toddmparker> that seems stalled
[09:16:38] <toddmparker> or just do a very simple demo and explain how to do this yourself w/custom CSS
[09:17:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I think we can have a demo in 1.3 for grid list
[09:17:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: not sure Keith is able to work on it
[09:17:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: but I have some CSS for that ready too
[09:17:42] <toddmparker> ok, great
[09:17:47] <toddmparker> it can be minimal
[09:18:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: would just need to update it a little
[09:18:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: lets ask Keith if he still wants to work on it
[09:18:57] <uGoMobi> otherwise I can do it
[09:20:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I  guess I'm not too familiar with doing a reset.
[09:20:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I know there are plenty of examples, but I tried it, and it didn't make a diff to me.
[09:20:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I guess I must've done it wrong.
[09:20:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no no, I just wanted to make sure 
[09:21:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: pasting one sec
[09:21:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think a nav reset should also include reloading the navigate module, because that one unconditionally adds a urlHistory entry at the bottom.
[09:22:04] <johnbender> https://gist.github.com/0181ab1bf3ec204e3f4d
[09:22:15] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: clear the stack and navigate to home
[09:22:29] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: ok
[09:22:32] <johnbender> it's reasonable to expect the first two lines would be in the navReset method
[09:22:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: anyhow
[09:22:37] <toddmparker> man, this panel re-factor is a bear
[09:22:40] <johnbender> I need to address that other issue first
[09:22:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: with a reset there are a total of 3 failures for all of the sequence tests
[09:22:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What is home? The inintial value of location.href?
[09:23:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: correct
[09:23:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: sorry
[09:23:09] <toddmparker> we're wondering if we should pull back on the push mode - performance is hard to get up to the level of reveal or overlay
[09:23:11] <johnbender> let me include that
[09:23:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. I'll add that to the setup for the sequence tests.
[09:23:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I've got it
[09:23:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I can take it the rest of the way I think
[09:23:56] <johnbender> but I'll probably need you to make sure I didn't screw anythin up
[09:23:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ...
[09:24:21] <johnbender> https://gist.github.com/0181ab1bf3ec204e3f4d
[09:24:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP. I've got some failure scenarios here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5091#issuecomment-11328186
[09:24:28] <johnbender> commnented with home value
[09:24:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker:the only difference between push and reveal is the animation right?
[09:25:06] <toddmparker> no, push causes the page to reflow to make room for it at wider screen sizes
[09:25:14] <toddmparker> that is what makes it so heavy
[09:25:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker oh ok it shrings the main content to make room for it self
[09:26:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thats tough because i could see that being a really popular mode 
[09:28:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Running now with navReset in place ...
[09:29:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah that made a big difference for me, but again I need to address that issue where it's creating a new history entry
[09:29:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[09:30:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There's also the issue of dialog /not/ creating a new history entry when the URL starts out having a dialogHashKey ...
[09:30:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... but I think I got that one ...
[09:30:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that I've fixed
[09:30:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: same with popup
[09:30:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I've got that fixed locally
[09:30:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, OK ... 
[09:31:30] <_|Nix|_> path1-path2 tests are still timing out for me.
[09:31:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah yes, still an issue here too
[09:32:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'll take a look at those :(
[09:34:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It's a JS failure, IINM. For some reason the special case for dialogs in _handleHashChange is taking effect, and $.mobile.activePage is not yet set, so it tries to run undefined.is( ".ui-dialog" ) ...
[09:35:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah I haven't looked at it
[09:35:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: but I've dealt with that in the past
[09:35:44] <johnbender> it's generally an event binding timing issue
[09:36:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I would say go ahead and work on that one but I'll probably be able to sort it out quickly
[09:36:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and these are my test failures to deal with in the first place
[09:36:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: already much better
[09:36:40] <johnbender> (from the work you've done)
[09:37:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'd much rather not work on this then for risk of stepping on your toes.
[09:37:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah that's what I'm thinking
[09:37:33] <johnbender> thanks for you help so far though
[09:37:40] <johnbender> big improvement
[09:38:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP. I'll check some scenarios manually after you get all the tests to pass.
[09:38:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I may not have covered everything with the sequence tests.
[09:38:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There are just so many sequences.

[13:15:52] <RWhitbeck> Sorry I missed the meeting … too much work today. 
[13:17:24] <ryanneufeld> hey guys, I hate to be a pain, but I could use some help with something, we've gone to production with 1.2.0
[13:17:45] <ryanneufeld> and I've got a third party widget that injects an iframe into a given div
[13:18:13] <ryanneufeld> now when the page changes, that iframe is no longer visible...
[13:19:48] <toddmparker> eesh. don't :)
[13:20:54] <ryanneufeld> ha, well, this is in production
[13:21:01] <ryanneufeld> and I am fairly stumped
[13:21:30] <ryanneufeld> the div exists on every page, as part of our page boiler plate
[13:22:22] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: what is the event the widget uses to inject the iframe?
[13:22:38] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: mobile init
[13:23:00] <ryanneufeld> it can be seen here m.metrolyrics.com
[13:23:00] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: there is your problem thats only ever fired once
[13:23:11] <arschmitz> you need it bound to pageinit
[13:23:13] <ryanneufeld> I tried it on pageinit too
[13:23:16] <ryanneufeld> and it didn't work
[13:23:24] <arschmitz> hmm hold on ill look
[13:23:33] <ryanneufeld> seems that the div is duplicated
[13:23:51] <ryanneufeld> when I inspect in chrome, the active page, isn't the one that's getting modified..
[13:23:54] <arschmitz> Oh are you using an id on it?
[13:23:58] <arschmitz> or a class?
[13:24:00] <ryanneufeld> id
[13:24:10] <ryanneufeld> has to be an id
[13:24:14] <ryanneufeld> third party..
[13:24:15] <ryanneufeld> :S
[13:24:19] <arschmitz> when you pull in a new page with that div you now have two divs with sdame id
[13:24:21] <arschmitz> same
[13:24:25] <ryanneufeld> Yup, I know
[13:24:42] <arschmitz> so thats the problem your selecting by id so it only sees the first one
[13:25:12] <ryanneufeld> so ids are useless with jquerymobile then?
[13:25:25] <arschmitz> they have to be unique in the whole app not just a given page
[13:25:30] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:25:32] <arschmitz> or site
[13:25:33] <ryanneufeld> :S
[13:25:35] <ryanneufeld> fuck
[13:25:51] <ryanneufeld> I was afraid of that
[13:26:03] <arschmitz> sorry
[13:26:13] <ryanneufeld> nah, it's a DOM thing
[13:26:18] <ryanneufeld> I should know better
[13:26:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: When the view source is showing on top of a city, and I swipe inside the view source widget, it switches cities.
[13:27:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The swipe should only work on top of the image, not on top of the view-source popup, right?
[13:27:34] <ryanneufeld> thanks arschmitz
[13:27:46] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: no problem
[13:29:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I guess it's OK for demo purposes.
[13:29:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wouldn't want to make the demo code too complicated.
[13:39:27] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15jlembeck pushed 1 new commit to 06slide-panel-refactor: 02http://git.io/7w_Gww
[13:39:27] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06slide-panel-refactor 14151fb7c 15Jeffrey Lembeck: Use clip to kill visibility of panels during page rendering. Add...
[13:40:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the swipe is bound to document so it will always swipe
[13:40:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: would have to return false on swipe on the view source
[13:41:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not document page but still same thing 
[13:42:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You could check the event.target in the handler and ignore it if it's not from the image.
[13:42:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But, like I said, it's fine for a demo.
[13:42:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah that would work to same idea 
[13:42:58] <_|Nix|_> Is uGoMobi still around?
[13:43:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: doesnt seem it
[13:45:25] <_|Nix|_> ?tell uGoMobi In the definition of $.fn.viewSourceCode shouldn't demoId be declared outside the plugin? Otherwise you can end up with the same value for demoId on different pages, but in the same body, so if you're not careful about scoping your selectors, you may get glitches.
[13:45:26] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[13:50:22] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: any idea why I'm seeing some of my script tags show up in the body? when I've only ever had them in the header?
[13:50:43] <ryanneufeld> they aren't there in view source, but they are in the elements panel of the web inspector
[13:51:07] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: nope thats a new one to me 
[13:52:30] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: not sure how that would happen 
[13:53:13] <ryanneufeld> nor do I
[13:53:17] <ryanneufeld> it's very odd
[13:53:48] <arschmitz> is there any rhyme or reason to which scripts are showing up in the body?
[13:54:46] <ryanneufeld> kinda
[13:54:52] <ryanneufeld> I'm checking something else
[13:55:32] <ryanneufeld> all my script tags are closed....
[13:59:22] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[13:59:26] <ryanneufeld> I'm stumped again...
[13:59:45] <ryanneufeld> most of this code is like two years old too
[13:59:46] <arschmitz> im looking now to see if i can see anything
[14:01:18] <arschmitz> do you know what the mbox script container is all about?
[14:01:30] <arschmitz> looks suspicus to me lol 
[14:02:35] <arschmitz> it looks like http://m.metrolyrics.com/js/s_code_tm.js is moving everything after it into the body
[14:02:48] <arschmitz> its hard to tell because that file is minified
[14:04:31] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: ^^
[14:05:00] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, i don't have an un-minified version...
[14:05:38] <ryanneufeld> and no source maps either :S
[14:05:55] <arschmitz> its everything after that thats being moved so id look at that or maybe the google analytics script but that would be weird
[14:06:49] <arschmitz> my guess is  http://m.metrolyrics.com/js/s_code_tm.js because its everything after that and that is the script thats making the mbox script container thats right before the scripts moved into body
[14:07:16] <arschmitz> and just the name mboxScriptContainer sounds suspicus
[14:07:35] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: if its not to hard try making that the last script in your head and see what happens
[14:07:42] <ryanneufeld> it will break
[14:08:25] <ryanneufeld> we're using omniture
[14:08:26] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: will ok then lol
[14:08:40] <ryanneufeld> I'll try moving it to the footer
[14:09:39] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: ok yeah not really sure since its minified but i think that is your culprit here
[14:10:29] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: yeah
[14:10:32] <ryanneufeld> very odd
[14:10:43] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: sorry i couldnt be more help on this one
[14:10:47] <ryanneufeld> must be some shitty way of attempting to async load it self
[14:10:54] <ryanneufeld> moving it to the footer 'solved' it
[14:11:11] <arschmitz> ok so yeah thats what it was then
[14:11:19] <arschmitz> but thats a REALLY poorly written script lol
[14:11:49] <ryanneufeld> now I'm replacing ids with classes
[14:11:59] <arschmitz> just grabs everything after it and throws in body yikes
[14:12:54] <ryanneufeld> I really, really, really don't want to work on sites with ads anymore
[14:12:59] <ryanneufeld> though I did learn a neat trick
[14:13:19] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: cool well at least i could help you find the problems even if i couldnt fix them for you lol
[14:13:29] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: oh yeah whats that?
[14:13:32] <ryanneufeld> apparently if you breakup document.writes of script tags into many of them
[14:13:40] <ryanneufeld> it doesn't break when you async load it in an iframe
[14:13:43] <ryanneufeld> but if you have one
[14:13:51] <ryanneufeld> your base are belong to ad
[14:14:32] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: neat ill have to keep that in mind
[14:15:43] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: if you need anything else im heading home but will be back on in half an hour or so
[14:15:59] <ryanneufeld> thanks, I appreciate the help
[14:16:12] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: no problem
[14:16:13] <ryanneufeld> I'll probably still be here
[14:16:49] <arschmitz> lol cool ill be around most of the night there is a meeting in here in a little under 2 hours

[15:29:25] <arschmitz> Yea I'm not aware of any issues but I'm not sure
[15:29:54] <arschmitz> Latest is fine with it but not positive on 1.2

[15:56:47] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Hey!
[15:56:55] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I made it after all :)

[15:57:36] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Hi~! _|Nix|_. :)
[15:57:37] <toddmparker_> Hi all
[15:57:48] <toddmparker_> Changsuk: hello!
[15:58:01] <Changsuk> Todd: Hi, Todd~! :)
[15:58:15] <toddmparker_> nice to finally meet up. timezones are tough
[15:58:25] <Changsuk> Todd: Nice to talk to you here.
[15:58:31] <_|Nix|_> Tell me about it ...
[15:58:39] <toddmparker_> thank arschmitz - he clued me in that it was now and not 7am tomorrow
[15:58:50] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: you are a hero for staying up so late
[15:58:52] <Changsuk> Todd: Yes, I think so.
[15:59:05] <arschmitz> Helps I was in Seoul last months
[15:59:09] <toddmparker_> ok, let's get started so we can let people get to bed :)
[15:59:47] <toddmparker_> so Changsuk - can you summarize what code you'd like to open source?
[16:00:16] <toddmparker_> it also might be easiest to start with the performance improvements you'd like us to review
[16:00:17] <Changsuk> Todd: to jQM?
[16:00:52] <toddmparker_> yes, you mentioned you had a number of performance improvements you'd like to share
[16:01:32] <Changsuk> Todd: yes, right. so my team is summarizing the performance issues and them will put it on Pull Request soon.
[16:02:13] <Changsuk> Todd: After they put it, I'll email you. :)
[16:02:21] <toddmparker_> great. my suggestion on any PR (pull request) is that each individual change is a separate PR
[16:02:40] <_|Nix|_> Definitely.
[16:02:46] <toddmparker_> instead of it being a large PR that touches a lot of files. those are very hard to review and test
[16:02:49] <arschmitz> Much easier to reviews
[16:03:12] <Changsuk> Todd : so My members don't have a permission to write on PR.
[16:03:51] <toddmparker_> for example, a PR that says "improved the collapsible responsiveness by adjusting the touch events" is much easier for us to quickly review or reject than a single one that makes lots fo changes across the library
[16:03:54] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Clone jQM on github, apply your changes, and submit a PR.
[16:04:26] <toddmparker_> yes, that is the process. anyone can submit a PR by following those steps _|Nix|_ just said
[16:04:42] <arschmitz> Can be good to use branches too for larger changes 
[16:05:06] <toddmparker_> we frequently use PRs internally when we make changes we want reviewed, even though we may be committers
[16:05:19] <Changsuk> Todd: but Kangsik who is a memeber of my team, he cloned but he can not to add or commit to the Repo.
[16:05:52] <toddmparker_> This will help: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request
[16:06:32] <toddmparker_> a PR is essentially a way to suggest that edits made in your local repo be merged into ours
[16:06:52] <Changsuk> Todd: Ok, I see. If there is a problem to write a PR, I'll ask you or Gabriel.
[16:07:17] <toddmparker_> so each of your team members can clone the main jQM repo, make changes and test them locally, then submit PRs for suggested fixes and improvements
[16:07:31] <toddmparker_> sure, we're here to help. 
[16:07:31] <Changsuk> Anyway, Here are two members in my team.
[16:07:50] <Changsuk> If you don't mind, I'd like to introduce them to you.
[16:07:55] <toddmparker_> just have your team hop on here and ask for assistance and we can walk them through it. 
[16:08:11] <arschmitz> Anyone will be happy to helps
[16:08:15] <toddmparker_> absolutely, are they here now?
[16:08:32] <Changsuk> Todd: yes, they are.
[16:09:03] <_|Nix|_> Hyunsook and Kangsik, IINM.
[16:09:03] <Changsuk> Hyunsook, Kangsik, could you introduce yourselves to them?
[16:09:10] <toddmparker_> great. if they are in the channel, they can introduce themselves and we can learn their IRC nickname
[16:09:39] <Hyunsook> Hello~ all
[16:09:46] <Changsuk> arschmitz: Thanks for your kind help in advance. :)
[16:09:47] <Hyunsook> Nice to meet you. :-)
[16:10:00] <Kangsik> Hi. Nive to meet you. :-) My name is kangsik kim.
[16:10:26] <Changsuk> They are dedicated to develope and manage three Tizen widgets - VirtualGrid, Handler and MultiButtonEntry.
[16:10:30] <arschmitz> Hello Hyunsook Kangsik nice to meet you Botha
[16:10:35] <toddmparker_> hello Hyunsook and Kangsik 
[16:10:55] <Hyunsook> I'm Hyunsook Park working with Changsuk. Currently, I develop and manage the VirtualGrid widget.
[16:11:11] <toddmparker_> are there demo or docs up somewhere for those 3 widgets?
[16:11:38] <toddmparker_> we're not familiar so seeing something is always helpful
[16:12:00] <Changsuk> Todd: yes, we have a demo
[16:12:10] <toddmparker_> so Hyunsook works on the grid and Kangsik works on the handler and multibuttonentry?
[16:12:14] <toddmparker_> great
[16:12:39] <Changsuk> Todd: yu can see a widget on this site - http://http://steady.dominohosting.kr/intro.html
[16:13:12] <Changsuk> Todd: yes, right.
[16:13:14] <toddmparker_> ^ just need to add the : after http://
[16:13:45] <Kangsik> please visit here. http://steady.dominohosting.kr/intro.html
[16:13:56] <Changsuk> Todd: I'm sorry that I mistyped.
[16:14:16] <toddmparker_> no problem, just telling the others how to fix it
[16:14:40] <toddmparker_> so http://steady.dominohosting.kr/intro.html#multibuttonentry is useful for an email recipient list, tag list, etc.
[16:15:02] <Changsuk> yes, right.
[16:15:22] <_|Nix|_> Funny - we're using the same syntax highlighter, I think :)
[16:15:30] <Changsuk> It looks like a iOS widget on the iPhone.
[16:15:53] <toddmparker_> does it have a different appearance on the iPhone?
[16:16:06] <Changsuk> _Nix_: same syntex? what was that mean?
[16:16:35] <toddmparker_> I think _|Nix|_ was talking about the code view here - http://steady.dominohosting.kr/intro.html#source
[16:16:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Yeah.
[16:16:46] <toddmparker_> and the syntax color coding plugin you used for that
[16:16:49] <Changsuk> ah ha~ I see. :)
[16:17:05] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: We use the same plugin in our demos.
[16:17:37] <Changsuk> Yes, we are develope Tizen widget with basic jQM guides.
[16:17:51] <toddmparker_> great. do you have demos for the other two plugins?
[16:17:59] <toddmparker_> just curious what they are
[16:18:01] <Changsuk> _Nix_: yes, right.
[16:19:10] <Changsuk> Todd: I haven't prepared yet, They(HS, KS) are summarzing now and yu can see it in next thusday.
[16:19:44] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[16:19:44] <Changsuk> After they make it, I'll will send yu an email with the widget demos.
[16:20:21] <toddmparker_> ok, that's fine. just playing with that demo on my iphone. looks good.
[16:20:56] <toddmparker_> if you add the viewport meta tag and set the device width, it will zoom in and be more usable
[16:21:52] <toddmparker_> so as far as widgets go, how many new widgets have you built for jQuery Mobile?
[16:21:53] <Changsuk> Todd, _Nix_: ok, I'll do it to work on a iPhone and send yu a demo movie.
[16:22:23] <toddmparker_> and can you explain a bit how this code fits with the ui-web-fw code the Intel has open sourced?
[16:22:54] <toddmparker_> just trying to understan how everything fits together
[16:23:38] <Changsuk> Todd: I think 4~5 widgets can be put on jQM.
[16:24:44] <toddmparker_> so there are a few others that Samsung would like to open source?
[16:25:35] <Changsuk> Todd: I'm sorry that I can't understand that the Widget codes fit.
[16:26:27] <toddmparker_> I'm trying to understand how these widgets relate to the ones Intel created. Is there shared code there? 
[16:26:29] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: How are these widgets related to web-ui-fw? Are they?
[16:26:35] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: maybe you can help
[16:26:41] <toddmparker_> right. thanks
[16:27:10] <Changsuk> Yes, those widgets are merged on Tizen web-ui-fw now.
[16:27:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Well, they are definitely not in from the web-ui-fw repo. Changsuk and his team may have developed it further.
[16:27:37] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: thanks so much. :)
[16:28:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I mean, they may have developed web-ui-fw further.
[16:28:34] <Changsuk> my team has developed all of wigets to adapt on Tizen open source.
[16:29:04] <toddmparker_> I see, ok. So web-ui-fw is older code
[16:29:14] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: is that maintained?
[16:29:38] <toddmparker_> Changsuk: Your team maintains all the code for Tizen
[16:30:03] <Changsuk> No, my team and SEC team have maintained and developed new modules after that.
[16:30:05] <toddmparker_> I think this is getting clearer for me. Sorry for all the questions.
[16:30:20] <toddmparker_> SEC team?
[16:30:25] <Changsuk> Todd: yes, right
[16:30:39] <Changsuk> Samsung Electronics ;)
[16:30:47] <toddmparker_> Ah, of course :)
[16:31:05] <Changsuk> there is a team in SEC R&D division.
[16:31:36] <Changsuk> the team has worked with my team.
[16:32:21] <toddmparker_> Ok, I understand
[16:32:40] <toddmparker_> So bringing new widgets into the library is definitely a possibility. As you probably heard from _|Nix|_, the popup started as a widget in web-ui-fw and went through the process of becoming an official widget in 1.2.
[16:33:10] <_|Nix|_> Here's a version that's 3 months old: https://review.tizen.org/git/?p=framework/web/web-ui-fw.git;a=tree;f=src/widgets;h=5dc73e5b0b352eb2145c6dae6b67daaadadd5642;hb=HEAD
[16:33:37] <toddmparker_> Based on our experience with popup, it took 3-4 months of pretty intense work to get that in and he's been working pretty much full time with us 
[16:34:13] <_|Nix|_> That directory contains all the three widgets mentioned so far, plus all the original web-ui-fw widgets.
[16:34:15] <toddmparker_> Thanks _|Nix|_ 
[16:34:33] <toddmparker_> so all the code is coming from that repo
[16:35:01] <Changsuk> Todd, _NIx_: Yes, right. the new version of popup widget which is made by _Nix_ is merging to web-ui-fw now. It'll be added soon.
[16:35:20] <toddmparker_> ah, that's great. 
[16:35:43] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: So, you're updating web-ui-fw to use the popup widget from jQM?
[16:36:03] <toddmparker_> fantastic. so if you have more developers who want to work in a similiar role as _|Nix|_ to help bring a widget into the core library, that would be great
[16:36:42] <Changsuk> _Nix_: yes, right. the new popup will be add one of these days.
[16:36:51] <toddmparker_> congrats _|Nix|_ 
[16:37:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: We've gone full circle.
[16:37:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Thanks!
[16:37:17] <toddmparker_> yes, and that's great. 
[16:37:19] <Changsuk> Thank you, _|Nix|_.
[16:37:50] <toddmparker_> now Tizen knows we will fully support that code 
[16:38:15] <toddmparker_> popup was fast tracked because popups are such a common UI element
[16:38:40] <Changsuk> Yes, right. It is a basic widget.
[16:38:55] <toddmparker_> so with all the other widgets, it's just a matter of figuring out which would be most impactful for the library to add and lining them up into our roadmap
[16:39:36] <toddmparker_> if you had dedicated developers like _|Nix|_ who did the bulk of the development work, we can move forward faster  on these items
[16:40:24] <Changsuk> Todd: the other widget is my teams' widgets? is it right?
[16:40:46] <toddmparker_> I think _|Nix|_ can attest to how much time it takes to get all the items I mentioned in the email today all lined up, but it's worth it
[16:40:52] <toddmparker_> Changsuk: yes
[16:42:06] <toddmparker_> Changsuk: so is the plan to have Hyunsook and Kangsik dedicated to working on jQuery Mobile?
[16:42:54] <Changsuk> Yes, I read your suggestion on your email so I'll ask about it with my team and a member of my team can be dedicated. :)
[16:45:15] <_|Nix|_> I built that repo: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/web-ui-fw/demos/tizen-winsets/
[16:45:15] <Changsuk> Hyunsook or Kangsik may be a dedicated developer to maintain tizen widgets on jQM.
[16:45:23] <toddmparker_> great. I think it's fair to say that a full time developer can probably get one widget into shape per release
[16:46:27] <toddmparker_> so part of the process will be figuring out what to tackle first based on our roadmap and what we hear from users as priorities. we can work with you on that.
[16:46:49] <toddmparker_> If it's helpful, I can explain where we are at the moment. Currently, the team is working on version 1.3 with will include a few new widgets (responsive tables, panels, range slider). In 1.4, we are going to be primarily working on re-factoring code for performance and consistency and will at most add one new widget, the Tab widget from jQuery UI. 
[16:46:59] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: what version of tizen widget did yu use?
[16:47:00] <toddmparker_> 1.3 will be in beta at the end of the year and hopefully final by the end of January.
[16:47:00] <toddmparker_> 1.4 will take roughly 3 months to complete with a projected release in March
[16:47:00] <toddmparker_> 1.5 will start planning in Feb/March and in development Apr-June timeframe
[16:47:41] <toddmparker_> I'd expect that we could try to get a Tizen widget into the 1.5 release if all goes well
[16:47:45] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Whatever's on https://review.tizen.org/git/?p=framework/web/web-ui-fw.git;a=tree;h=HEAD;hb=HEAD
[16:48:08] <Changsuk> Todd: Sound good~! :)
[16:48:24] <toddmparker_> since 1.4 will be a heavy re-factor, we don't want add more code sooner because we're making some bigger changes
[16:48:32] <Changsuk> Todd: Thanks~ :)
[16:48:40] <toddmparker_> hope that helps lay out a clearer roadmap
[16:49:19] <toddmparker_> I'd also like to work with you on making the tizen code above more accessible now to developers. 
[16:49:59] <Changsuk> Todd: Ok, my team is willing to your roadmap and keep in touch with your team.
[16:50:03] <toddmparker_> There is a ton of great code there, but it seems to be harder for folks to just grab a single widget and get the docs for it
[16:50:19] <Changsuk> willing to follow~ :)
[16:50:32] <Changsuk> I'm sorry. I mistyped. :)
[16:50:42] <toddmparker_> so maybe we can work on ways to make all that code more popular now through demos and us promoting it
[16:51:20] <toddmparker_> just because it's not in the core library now doesn't mean we can't make it very easy for folks to use it
[16:51:45] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: I know you had some ideas on this earlier
[16:52:06] <toddmparker_> Changsuk: great
[16:52:39] <_|Nix|_> Well, we were going to merge Changsuk's code into web-ui-fw.
[16:52:48] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: If you don't mind, could yu tell me the ideas?
[16:52:55] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: That was it.
[16:53:29] <toddmparker_> So I think this is a great start. I think the next step would be for Changsuk, Hyunsook and Kangsik to have a presence here on the IRC channel so we can more closely coordinate and get to know each other
[16:53:54] <toddmparker_> Next week, you will post up a few more widget demos
[16:54:17] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Do yu mean that jQM and Tizen web-ui-fw are merged smoothly?
[16:54:40] <_|Nix|_> But now I'm thinking we may want to do a deep restructure of the web-ui-fw repo, because it works fundamentally differently from jQM. For example, in order to use it at all, you need to run make. Not like jQM, where you have an index.php file which concatentates all the sources.
[16:54:54] <_|Nix|_> Also, the widgets do not have AMD wrappers.
[16:55:14] <Changsuk> Todd: yes, we'll tell you more and more here or via emails.
[16:55:19] <toddmparker_> And we should look sooner at raising awareness of the web-ui-fw plugins, creating demos, and working to reduce barriers to use (like make) and following more of our conventions
[16:55:48] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: yes, that was the issue for me. It seemed to be much harder to clone the repo down and get it working
[16:55:50] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: What I was saying is that we work in https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw to make the whole repo more like jQM, and improve the widgets destined for jQM at the same time.
[16:56:00] <toddmparker_> understanding dependencies is also harder
[16:56:09] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: exactly
[16:56:51] <toddmparker_> most of our developers just want to grab a js and css file for a widget and read some simple docs on how to use it
[16:57:36] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: The most important first step is to make sure the repo here (https://review.tizen.org/git/?p=framework/web/web-ui-fw.git;a=summary) is up-to-date.
[16:58:13] <Changsuk> Todd: ok, I got your email and read guides. so my team will check and make it all.
[16:58:14] <toddmparker_> agreed
[16:58:17] <toddmparker_> I know it's very late for _|Nix|_ and others so let's plan on keeping these conversations moving forward here and on email in the coming weeks
[16:58:22] <toddmparker_> Changsuk: great!
[16:58:35] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: If you keep that repo up-to-date, I can start to merge your changes into https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw
[16:58:37] <toddmparker_> I forgot to mention the AMD wrapper in that checklist
[16:58:53] <toddmparker_> we can probably put together a more detailed checklist for you
[16:59:05] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: In the meantime, Hyunsook and Kangsik can clone jQM and start working on those widgets which should be pushed upstream.
[16:59:57] <Changsuk> Todd: ok, i'll do it.
[17:00:00] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: The final goal (IMO) should be for web-ui-fw to be as loose as jQM in that people can just rip out widgets and use them individually.
[17:00:12] <toddmparker_> excellent. _|Nix|_ will be extremely helpful since he's gone through the process and knows you code
[17:00:13] <toddmparker_> (thanks _|Nix|_ 
[17:00:41] <toddmparker_> +1 Exactly
[17:00:54] <toddmparker_> Alright everyone, I need to sign off. Thanks to everyone for taking the time to get together and we look forward to working together.
[17:01:17] <toddmparker_> It was very nice to meet you Changsuk, Hyunsook and Kangsik
[17:01:18] <arschmitz> On another note were any of you at jquery Asia?
[17:01:31] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: If my team has any questions, I'll ask you it, pls give us a favor, thanks in advance.
[17:01:43] <toddmparker_> thanks arschmitz and _|Nix|_ for being here, really appreciate it
[17:01:46] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Sure ...
[17:01:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: NP.
[17:01:53] <Changsuk> It is nice talking with you. thanks. :)
[17:02:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker_:  not a problems
[17:02:07] <toddmparker_> Bye all!
[17:02:10] <_|Nix|_> Between us, I think we got the world pretty much spanned.
[17:02:17] <Changsuk> bye, Todd~! :)
[17:02:39] <Changsuk> _Nix_: thanks for your late chatting here. :)
[17:02:48] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: NP. HTH.
[17:03:42] <Changsuk> _Nix_: yes, I think so. :) we can do it.
[17:03:44] <arschmitz> Changsuk: I'm usually here until about 2 pm your time if anyone needs anything 
[17:04:10] <Changsuk> arschmitz: really?
[17:04:22] <Changsuk> are yu ok?
[17:04:34] <_|Nix|_> I moved the demo to a place that does not go to sleep along with my computer :) http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/web-ui-fw/demos/tizen-winsets/
[17:04:44] <arschmitz> Yes and I'm normally back about 9pm your times
[17:05:12] <_|Nix|_> Alright - on that cheery note, I think I shall hit the hay.
[17:05:15] <_|Nix|_> L8R all!
[17:06:03] <arschmitz> Night _|Nix|_
[17:06:08] <Changsuk> _Nix_: Ok, Thanks, I'll see the demo. :)
[17:06:49] <arschmitz> Changsuk: We're you or any of your team members at jquery Asia?
[17:07:59] <Changsuk> arschmitz: jQuery Asia? is a conference in Korea or Asia?

[23:13:32] <uGoMobi> morning all
[23:13:32] <bot-t> (9 hours 28 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell uGoMobi In the definition of $.fn.viewSourceCode shouldn't demoId be declared outside the plugin? Otherwise you can end up with the same value for demoId on different pages, but in the same body, so if you're not careful about scoping your selectors, you may get glitches.
[23:14:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ , arschmitz : thanks for looking into view source code
[23:14:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure what you mean by "demold"
[23:36:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I now see you already fixed the source code view... great, thanks!!
[23:40:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and after a cup of coffee it's clear to me that "demold" is demoID and not demoLD :)
