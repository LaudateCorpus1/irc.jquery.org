[05:50:45] <toddmparker> good morning!
[05:50:55] <toddmparker> back from my epic trip
[05:51:09] <toddmparker> just got back to boston on the red eye. didn't sleep
[05:51:11] <arschmitz> Morning toddmparker
[05:51:12] <toddmparker> brain fried
[05:52:10] <toddmparker> hey ar
[05:52:12] <toddmparker> arschmitz: 
[05:52:23] <toddmparker> i just added a bunch of new demo pages
[05:52:28] <arschmitz> toddmparker: how was california?
[05:52:30] <arschmitz> nice
[05:53:01] <arschmitz> so there is a bit of a dilema for the deeplinks i need to know your thoughts on
[05:53:02] <toddmparker> we have a lot to do there
[05:53:02] <toddmparker> it was nice
[05:53:02] <toddmparker> warmer than here for sure
[05:53:11] <toddmparker> yeah?
[05:53:15] <arschmitz> yeah its -9 here right now and heat went out last night
[05:53:18] <toddmparker> what's up
[05:53:54] <arschmitz> i can make it all work perfect
[05:54:13] <arschmitz> and it will open up some other very requested features too
[05:54:20] <toddmparker> but...
[05:54:37] <arschmitz> it should probably wait untill after 1.3
[05:54:54] <arschmitz> and there isnt really a way to add it to demos untill then
[05:55:07] <arschmitz> because it involves chaning the link binding in nav
[05:55:42] <toddmparker> i see
[05:55:58] <toddmparker> this in for all links?
[05:56:08] <toddmparker> i've been filling out the "in this section" anchors
[05:56:26] <toddmparker> which are just non-ajax
[05:56:39] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:56:52] <arschmitz> this will make it so deeplinks work exactly like native
[05:57:12] <arschmitz> you link to an id as long as its not a page dialog or popup and exists it will scroll to it
[05:57:16] <arschmitz> no special anything
[05:57:28] <toddmparker> that would be nice
[05:57:36] <arschmitz> and if you put it at the end of a link to a page it will scroll after page show
[05:57:39] <toddmparker> so for 1.3, should i comment out those anchors?
[05:57:49] <arschmitz> well we have 2 options i think
[05:58:40] <arschmitz> you COULD make an argument that this is a bug fix in the parts that couldnt just be added to demos
[05:59:20] <arschmitz> because right now if you are on page /docs.demos/buttons/ and have a link /docs/demos/buttons/options.html#theme
[05:59:40] <arschmitz> the link that gets passed to changepage is /docs/demos/buttons/#theme
[05:59:52] <arschmitz> which makes no sense at all
[06:00:36] <arschmitz> its due to an overzelous regex that assumes anything with a hash in it is an application page (for either a dialog or nested listview)
[06:01:04] <toddmparker> right
[06:01:07] <arschmitz> if we change that to actually JUST filter dialogs and nested listviews and not just assume
[06:01:09] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15toddparker pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/Teb6nA
[06:01:09] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 143189868 15Todd Parker: Demos: Updated API links for accuracy
[06:01:21] <toddmparker> that seems smarter anyway
[06:01:32] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[06:01:45] <arschmitz> the other change is in the new navigate method which is new anyway
[06:02:07] <arschmitz> this change is to just kick ios4 out of popstate 
[06:02:16] <arschmitz> pushstate i mean
[06:02:27] <toddmparker> right
[06:02:34] <arschmitz> which makes nav much more sane anyway
[06:02:54] <arschmitz> right now we have to listen for both popstate and hashchange because ios4 is broken
[06:03:35] <arschmitz> this change would also allow people to update the hash with out adding a history entry which has been asked for a bunch
[06:04:17] <toddmparker> i think that johnbender would have the call on this
[06:04:22] <toddmparker> but it seems reasonable ego me
[06:04:27] <arschmitz> its his idea lol
[06:04:30] <toddmparker> *to* me
[06:04:33] <toddmparker> oh, cool
[06:04:42] <toddmparker> if all this has to wait, that's fine with me too
[06:04:46] <arschmitz> the question is is it ok to do this as a "Bug fix" or not
[06:04:57] <toddmparker> right
[06:05:11] <toddmparker> these do seem like bugs to me
[06:05:12] <arschmitz> we get a bunch of awesome gains from this
[06:05:16] <toddmparker> yup
[06:05:20] <arschmitz> ability to pass a hash to an external page
[06:05:22] <toddmparker> you have my vote
[06:05:26] <arschmitz> ability to deeplink
[06:05:33] <arschmitz> ability to update hash with out history
[06:05:43] <toddmparker> yeah. it's the one big web convention we don't follow
[06:05:56] <arschmitz> and it will make it really easy to support ajaxing in multi page documents
[06:06:05] <arschmitz> (for 1.4)
[06:06:15] <toddmparker> that would be cool
[06:06:24] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:06:31] <toddmparker> forcing a reload there is ugly
[06:06:43] <arschmitz> i agree its one thing i never liked
[06:07:42] <arschmitz> if we do want to put in 1.3 for this stuff maybe we could do a beta 2 and you could shout real lound in blog post?
[06:07:53] <arschmitz> loud
[06:11:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker: did you see agcolom managed to get some firefox phones for you?
[06:15:05] <toddmparker> yeah, that's awesome
[06:15:49] <toddmparker> is there a concern that this change could cause issues for people?
[06:16:55] <arschmitz> the only thing i could think of is if someone for some reason depends on /docs/demos/buttons/options.html#foo being squashed to /docs/demos/buttons/#foo
[06:17:38] <arschmitz> but i cant imagine why they would
[06:18:00] <arschmitz> we can keep the deeplinking out for now even
[06:18:10] <arschmitz> and just make the two changes that make it possible
[06:18:23] <arschmitz> the actual scrolling is completely standalone 
[06:22:36] <toddmparker> right, i like that as a compromise 
[06:22:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker: and we would probably have to tell people that we are kicking ios4 out of pushstate
[06:22:56] <arschmitz> since we previously supported
[06:23:27] <toddmparker> yeah
[06:23:39] <toddmparker> mind adding these items to the top of the 1.3 wiki page
[06:23:44] <arschmitz> sure
[06:23:54] <toddmparker> when we do the rc (or beta2) we can list out the changes
[06:24:00] <arschmitz> so holding off on the actual deeplinking for now though right?
[06:24:08] <arschmitz> just making the changes to make it possible
[06:24:54] <arschmitz> another option is we could make the deeplinking its own module so they could opt out in the builder
[06:25:13] <arschmitz> or even have it opted out by default for 1.3 and in by default for 1.4?
[06:26:03] <arschmitz> then you could just make a note that we finished it and wanted to offer it but it was not done in time for beta or something

[06:30:00] <arschmitz> oh toddmparker: im also all over a widget to auto generate links panel
[06:30:06] <arschmitz> and return to top links
[06:35:31] <toddmparker> arschmitz: sweet. i'll stop doing that manually then
[06:35:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm wondering ... that kind of h2-widget is somehow different from the other widgets, because it's more like a page plugin ... I don't quite know how to express this ... it's not a widget that's localized onto a specific area of the page.
[06:35:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It basically makes modifications all over a potentially long page.
[06:36:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah pretty much
[06:36:28] <arschmitz> its nothing that would be part of the library its just for docs
[06:36:31] <toddmparker> it should just be a doc utility that looks for h2's that have an id within a page with the class of docs
[06:36:40] <arschmitz> or demos rather
[06:36:46] <toddmparker> definitely not a library thing
[06:36:50] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:36:51] <toddmparker> sorry, demos
[06:37:06] <arschmitz> lol i was saying it because i said demos
[06:37:11] <arschmitz> i mean docs AHHH!
[06:37:28] <arschmitz> i always say the wrong one because its in the docs lol
[06:39:22] <_|Nix|_> Aaah, OK. I guess there's nothing preventing us from declaring widgets in docs/demos/_assets/js ...
[06:39:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah exactly
[06:41:38] <_|Nix|_> ... and I got it to concatentate those files in the make docs target, so if you add the widget definition to a separate file and then mention it in docs/demos/_assets/js/index.php and grunt.js it will work just fine.
[06:52:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: perfect
[06:54:01] <arschmitz> ill have 2 of them like that and one will come out and go into master after 1.3 so keeping seperate is good
[06:54:49] <_|Nix|_> Nice!

[09:11:03] <arschmitz> Holy cow go to google and type in "do a"
[09:16:30] <johnbender> toddmparker: arschmitz: support for hash refs in urls is a feature :)
[09:17:54] <arschmitz> aww come on 
[09:17:55] <arschmitz> lol
[09:22:48] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker: you both know that's a feature
[09:22:51] <johnbender> lol
[09:22:59] <johnbender> 1.4 is a great time to do that
[09:23:04] <johnbender> it's a refactor
[09:23:18] <johnbender> and I wouldn't add a UA sniff during a beta
[09:23:26] <johnbender> toddmparker: what's the plan on a beta.2 or RC
[09:23:49] <johnbender> toddmparker: we can probably move to RC if you want
[09:33:15] <toddmparker> johnbender: let's talk bout that on the call today. I think that the team has been patching things up as we go. I don't know of any blockers.
[09:33:41] <toddmparker> so we could do an rc next week if we feel like we can leave things alone :)
[09:34:08] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah sounds good
[09:34:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and arschmitz have been doing an awesome job cleaning up my messes :P
[09:34:36] <toddmparker> heck yeah

[09:34:43] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14dc24a33 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: Fixed typo. Thanks @rdworth for spotting
[09:34:46] <johnbender> but seriously _|Nix|_ arschmitz  -----> I appreciate it
[09:35:17] <toddmparker> so on the anchor stuff, i agree that's feature-y
[09:35:47] <toddmparker> was thinking that is we could just do something as a docs script (not lib), might be helpful. 
[09:36:05] <johnbender> toddmparker: there's a fundamental issue though
[09:36:09] <toddmparker> but fie e need to do some serious tinkering, i'd rather stay on target and just add the anchors in later
[09:36:12] <johnbender> because we assing the hash in both navigation cases
[09:36:19] <johnbender> assign
[09:36:34] <johnbender> so assigning a hash of location.hash = "foo/#hash" is a bad idea
[09:36:42] <johnbender> since the hash shouldn't contain a hash
[09:37:01] <johnbender> that's why we wanted to switch to pushState
[09:37:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: it occurs to me that we have to deal with the same problem for hashchange based browsers
[09:37:57] <johnbender> I feel like we must have dicussed that
[09:38:01] <johnbender> *discussed
[09:44:51] <toddmparker> is ios4 the only major platform that doesn't support push state?
[09:58:35] <johnbender> toddmparker: that's the impression I'm under
[09:58:35] <johnbender> toddmparker: still need to talk with arschmitz about how that will work for hashchange only browsers though
[09:58:49] <johnbender> toddmparker: we might just have to make it a ui-state anyhow
[10:32:59] <arschmitz> johnbender: hi sorry was at lunch
[10:33:17] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's cool I'm in a meeting right now
[10:33:31] <johnbender> toddmparker: I might be late to the team meeting today
[10:36:51] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok we should talk hash change when ever your free later or tomorrow
[10:37:06] <johnbender> kk
[10:40:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP. It's a lot of fun ...
[10:42:47] <arschmitz> johnbender: an as far as helping with nav iv been trying to get to know it better so im happy to help :)

[12:29:14] <toddmparker> i need to head home. haven't slept in 35+ hours
[12:30:01] <uGoMobi> sleep well toddmparker
[12:30:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I copied the link that opens the panel a ways down the page docs/demos/buttons/index.html and when I click the copy, it opens the panel and jumps to the top.
[12:30:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Nighterz!
[12:30:31] <toddmparker> can't sleep on a redeye
[12:30:33] <arschmitz> take it easy toddmparker: see you tomorrow
[12:30:38] <toddmparker> thanks all, i'll check in later
[12:30:39] <uGoMobi> Wilto: http://filamentgroup.github.com/X-rayHTML/ nice!!
[12:31:05] <Wilto> Thanks, dude! Gave you a shout-out in there; I wanted to get something up and running on our minimal widget template dealie.
[12:31:28] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw that... thanks
[12:31:36] <uGoMobi> really cool with that transition
[12:31:39] <uGoMobi> nice idea!
[12:31:50] <arschmitz> Wilto: that looks awesome
[12:31:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, you might be able to just repeat the same link over and over again. No need for a special jump-to-top link. Save the user a click.
[12:31:56] <Wilto> Any excuse to do a flip transition.
[12:32:03] <uGoMobi> :D
[12:32:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah thats true for this case
[12:32:42] <arschmitz> it will always bring them to the top
[12:32:49] <arschmitz> because its a panel link
[12:33:08] <arschmitz> but you might not want the panel you might just want to return to top
[12:33:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd've preferred that the panel not jump to the top, but instead position the list absolute and relative to the panel, and then .offset( {left: 0, top: $.mobile.window.scrollTop() } ) on panelbeforeopen ...
[12:33:33] <arschmitz> to click the nav button or something 
[12:33:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess ...
[12:34:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: have you seen the left menu on this page? http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/buttons/
[12:34:28] <arschmitz> they may often just want to jump to top for that or the api
[12:34:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's the page I'm looking at.
[12:35:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure id say that people always want the panel and not to return to top thats all
[12:36:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The other panel doesn't jump to the top.
[12:36:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly!
[12:36:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So why does opening the panel jump to the top?
[12:36:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats part of the way the made the panel
[12:36:45] <arschmitz> all panels
[12:36:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Opening the other panel doesn't jump to the top.
[12:37:05] <arschmitz> how are you opening it with out being at the top?
[12:37:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: $( "#panel-nav" ).panel( "open" );
[12:37:29] <arschmitz> oh ok
[12:37:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: and $( "#button-sections" ).panel( "open" );
[12:37:43] <arschmitz> got yeah in the console
[12:37:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The latter jumps, the former does not.
[12:38:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd rather the sections panel not jump, but instead position the menu at scrollTop().
[12:38:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ not sure i know its part of panel logic weather it does or not
[12:38:25] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15tbhockey opened issue #5524: Missing semicolons in jquery.mobile.structure-1.3.0-beta.1.css  02http://git.io/TbxCqA
[12:38:45] <arschmitz> they are both just regular panels nothing special
[12:38:53] <arschmitz> i didnt make either toddmparker: made both
[12:38:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... then that's pretty inconsistent.
[12:39:39] <arschmitz> maybe its because the left on is after the page the right one is before ?
[12:39:41] <arschmitz> im not sure
[12:40:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No idea. Still ... shouldn't jump. That's "jarring", as johnbender would say.
[12:40:34] <johnbender> uGoMobi: arschmitz https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5512
[12:40:44] <johnbender> I can't repro with the latest
[12:40:51] <johnbender> so I think that's fixed
[12:41:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah im not sure i know there was discussion about how to handle that but not sure what the outcome was i was not a part of it
[12:41:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I might've fixed it with the urlHistory stuff or that do-not-copy-the-hash stuff.
[12:41:11] <arschmitz> johnbender: awesome
[12:41:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course, there's no user-way of opening the sections panel from anywhere but the top, so this issue does not appear.
[12:41:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah
[12:42:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We should check whether a link to a panel placed such that scrollTop() > 0 will ever cause a jump, and if so, whether it will consistently cause a jump - which does not appear to be the case.
[12:42:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll file a bug ...
[12:43:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i figured it out
[12:43:12] <arschmitz> it has to do with the height of the panel content
[12:43:34] <arschmitz> if the panel will be in view when it opens it does not scroll
[12:43:49] <arschmitz> if the panel content wont be in view it scrolls to top
[12:44:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ you will see if you scroll to the very bottom and open them
[12:44:38] <arschmitz> they both act the same
[12:47:34] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #5525: Panel jumps to top of page  02http://git.io/H2pVTw
[12:47:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so that can be closed.
[12:48:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i knew there was some logic there just wasent sure what lol
[12:48:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, the only think keeping it from scrolling to the top when the left panel opens is that we have lots of demos?
[12:48:40] <arschmitz> yup
[12:49:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is the decision to scroll made after the panelbeforeopen is triggered? If so, you can add a handler that moves the payload down the page so the scrolling is not triggered.
[12:49:53] <arschmitz> not sure ill take a look
[12:49:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If it's not, then it should be made after panelbeforeopen to give devs a chance to do exactly this - or whatever else they want.
[12:54:20] <arschmitz> yeah ill take a look and see in a sec
[12:54:31] <arschmitz> have to help my mom with some html lol
[12:54:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ shes really bad with keeping track of closing tags :)
[12:59:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Teach her my trick: <div></div>^[[D^[[D^[[D^[[D^[[DBlah
[12:59:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's a matter of making that part of your muscle memory.
[12:59:42] <arschmitz> lol i know iv tried to get her to do it that way
[13:00:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: a year ago she was just making each page an image in photoshop and using an image map
[13:00:15] <arschmitz> shes made good progress i think lol
[13:02:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's awesome progress!
[13:03:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah 
[13:03:20] <arschmitz> crazy to think she does it professionally has her own sucessful business doing graphics and web design
[13:03:49] <arschmitz> and was still using full page images and image maps a year ago
[13:04:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im slowly teaching her as she does new sites
[13:07:18] <Wilto> I still use huge image maps, me.
[13:08:15] <arschmitz> Wilto: nice much easier to throw everything in a big image and eff google and seo and screen readers 
[13:09:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and mobile ...
[13:09:45] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:09:49] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Not if you make the images 320px wide.
[13:09:57] <Wilto> That’s how “mobile” works, right?
[13:10:54] <arschmitz> Dont you love to think there are still people out there making sites this way?
[13:15:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The beauty of working on a framework is that you're not responsible for how people that don't use your framework create their sites.
[13:16:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: unless they are your mom lol
[13:16:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly :)
[13:16:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Come to think of it - image maps + media queries ... hmmm ... place two image maps side-by-side vs. stacked. There's a lot of power in that.
[13:16:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Take the last millenium and combine it with the current one.
[13:18:23] <arschmitz> lol
[13:23:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ Wilto: http://www.garlockprinting.com/2012c/printing.html
[13:23:26] <arschmitz> full page images with a rotator ha ha
[13:23:38] <arschmitz> it rotates the entire page image
[13:30:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think my brain just segfaulted.
[13:31:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: lol yeah?
[13:46:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, looking at that site. It's just ... I dunno ... I guess it's not bad, per se, it's just ... wow ... Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[13:47:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah tell me about it thats one my mom made like a year ago
[13:47:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess the target audience is fine with the result.
[13:47:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ right now shes updating to use proper html 
[13:48:00] <arschmitz> the customer complained about google not seeing their text
[13:48:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aaah, yes ... indeed ...
[13:48:19] <arschmitz> even got jquery on there to rotate the images lol 
[13:48:29] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:49:22] <arschmitz> its slow going but shes slowly getting better lol
[13:49:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We'll have her on the team in no time :)
[13:49:46] <arschmitz> i think dreamweaver is her enemy personally that and copy and paste
[13:50:07] <arschmitz> copy and pasteing chunks of code is big trouble when you dont pay attention to closing tags
[13:50:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... definitely ... WYSIWYG editors are ... not.
[13:51:01] <arschmitz> lol
[13:51:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: She needs to learn due diligence, and browsers don't make it easy, because they're programmed to be as forgiving of bad coding as possible.
[13:51:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We take due diligence for granted, but we must remember that it's a learned skill.
[13:51:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah and now that shes learning css position relative is her new enemy....
[13:51:46] <arschmitz> its not where it should be
[13:51:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I bet all browsers have 1.0e6 heuristics for dealing with mismatched tags and stuff.
[13:51:58] <arschmitz> position relative bottom:430px right 280px lol
[13:52:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: D000d! CSS ... you're understating how well she's doing!
[13:53:04] <arschmitz> lol :) 
[13:53:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, seriously ... until about a year and a half ago, I didn't know anything about CSS either.
[13:53:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I did have a leg up though because I understood the concept of declarative.
[13:53:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah when i started teaching her html i also taught her basic css
[13:54:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's cool!
[13:55:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah shes learning pretty well
[13:55:30] <arschmitz> only had 2 help her with 2 pages on this site not every piece of every page so shes actually learning for sure
[13:55:52] <_|Nix|_> *nod* ... awesome!
[13:56:20] <arschmitz> yeah im just happy shes not using image maps any more
[13:56:24] <arschmitz> its a big step
[13:56:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and the good news is that if you give her pointers on something she's created, she'll learn much better from that.
[13:56:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly
[13:56:55] <arschmitz> and i try to explain why things are not working or what she needs to change
[13:57:03] <arschmitz> rather then just tell her whats wrong
[13:57:13] <arschmitz> i think it helps a lot when you actually work through it
[13:58:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's one of my big hurdles too. I'm not actually very good at designing Web pages. The interaction of the various display modes is still a bit of a hit-and-miss for me.
[13:58:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm glad we have people like Wilto and uGoMobi to take care of that stuff.
[13:59:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i think im pretty good with css because iv been working with it for quite a while now
[13:59:15] <arschmitz> but they are both much better then i am
[13:59:23] <arschmitz> and no all the little bugs and quirks
[13:59:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: to be honest though i much prefer the js side of things
[14:00:07] <_|Nix|_> Amen to that ... 
[14:00:08] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:00:32] <arschmitz> i dont considder my self a designer at all
[14:00:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The one thing that's really worth developing though is a spider-sense for when things should be done in CSS.
[14:01:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ for sure css is nearly always the better solution when possible
[14:07:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5525
[14:07:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am sure if I get it
[14:07:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: when you mentioned the web-ui0fw meeting that was 2am eastern right?
[14:07:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i closed that
[14:07:40] <uGoMobi> s/am sure/am not sure/
[14:07:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[14:07:57] <uGoMobi> ah
[14:07:59] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:08:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's 09:00 here, so that's 02:00 for you.
[14:08:06] <uGoMobi> that was 5 secs ago
[14:08:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's in #web-ui-fw
[14:08:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: or 31 minutes
[14:08:37] <uGoMobi> huh really?
[14:08:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, we've had it already today ... next one's next week.
[14:09:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i might try and make not sure though im not normally up at 2 am since i get up for work at 5 am lol
[14:09:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: i probably had it already open in the browser but didn't refresh
[14:09:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... that kinda sucks, but you can try to get them during the day ...
[14:09:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For example, Changsuk is in the channel even now ... maybe if you ping him ... *shrug* ...
[14:09:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah i tend to catch them at night here in the morning here
[14:10:15] <arschmitz> night here morning there lol
[14:11:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: probably 
[14:12:00] <_|Nix|_> Man ... I have a solution for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5519, but it's totally flaky ... http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/5519.html on iOS 6 ... tap "Login", then click on the first input (input method comes up). Click "Previous" repeatedly. The popup gets so many resizes that it disappears off the screen.
[14:12:14] <_|Nix|_> The whole thing is just generally jumpy.
[14:12:38] <arschmitz> why are so many resizes fireing?
[14:12:38] <_|Nix|_> ... and all because there's no atomic way of knowing where the focus is going given that you're being told the focus is leaving.
[14:13:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because focus briefly jumps to the select menu, and then the popup's logic kicks in and steals focus back, so that probably interacts with the open input method to cause a resize ...
[14:13:33] <arschmitz> ahh
[14:14:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... smashing the "Previous" button reliably makes the popup disappear. Close the input method though, and the popup will reappear after a while ...
[14:14:43] <arschmitz> crazy
[14:15:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: "If you're not going to receive any more resize events for the next n milliseconds then the resize/orientationchange madness must be over" is a very unreliable heuristic.
[14:15:12] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:17:07] <arschmitz> i hate anything timed like that
[14:17:32] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, but, unfortunately, there's no way around it :(
[14:17:36] <arschmitz> i know
[14:17:41] <arschmitz> but does not make me like it lol
[14:18:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll never forget johnbender's words (though I may not remember them to the letter either :) ): "Whenever someone uses setTimeout() I die a little inside."
[14:18:43] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:18:49] <arschmitz> every time we use a none zero set time out somewhere a browser dies 
[14:18:51] <arschmitz> ha ha
[14:18:53] <arschmitz> timeing there
[14:19:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I have since realized that a zero timeout is actually a valid almost-deterministic tool.
[14:19:38] <arschmitz> for sure
[14:19:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Although you can never know what the event queue holds.
[14:19:55] <arschmitz> a zero set time out does a very specific thing its not waiting
[14:22:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, for instance: To fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5519 I had to blur out the select, because, for some reason, the focus rectangle around it is retained when I focus the popup's container. It's like both the popup and the select have the focus. So, fine, blur the select before focusing the container, right? Wrong! If I do that, for some reason the button gets another focus event after I blur it.
[14:22:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I have to focus the container in this frame, and blur the select in the next frame.
[14:22:37] <arschmitz> had a nice talk about setTimeout 0 with jaubergee at one point
[14:22:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... meaning that the select gets another focus before the frame is out.
[14:23:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ ugly
[14:23:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Tell me about it. I have no idea where that focus comes from.
[14:23:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... I might wanna do a stack trace, actually ...
[14:23:53] <arschmitz> jaubourg lol i have great spelling some times
[14:24:26] <arschmitz> its ok hes not in this channel so he wont notice
[14:24:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There are transcripts on irc.jquery.org ;)
[14:24:47] <arschmitz> lol
[14:25:03] <arschmitz> some how i bet he does not check the mobile logs
[14:27:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ well im going to head home
[14:27:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Did the backtrace. It's the browser :(
[14:27:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright. Have a good one!
[14:27:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ stupid browsers emmiting events
[14:27:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Tell me about it ...
[14:28:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ ill see you in the morning 
[14:28:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ are you going to the portland conf in june?
[14:28:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: See ya then!
[14:28:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm thinking about it. I got an invite.
[14:28:47] <arschmitz> sweet
[14:28:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll talk about it at work on Mon.
[14:28:57] <arschmitz> be good to see everyone again
[14:29:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Indeed. We missed johnbender last time.
[14:29:15] <_|Nix|_> Hope he can make it this time.
[14:29:16] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:29:23] <arschmitz> its close to him so he should! lol
[14:29:33] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, for sure.
[14:29:36] <johnbender> hmm not sure
[14:29:38] <arschmitz> iv met johnbender: once before but it was quite a while back
[14:29:40] <johnbender> I'll have to talk with my wife
[14:29:43] <arschmitz> before the release of 1.0 lol
[14:30:06] <arschmitz> johnbender: lol yeah i had to get permission
[14:30:18] <arschmitz> its 2 weeks after my wife goes back to work from maternity leave!
[14:31:49] <arschmitz> ok leaving for real this time lol
[14:31:52] <arschmitz> bye all
[14:33:09] <_|Nix|_> L8R
