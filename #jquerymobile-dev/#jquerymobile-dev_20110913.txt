[05:57:12] <aaronmcadam> anyone aware of issues with collapsibles inside of dialogs causing the dialog to close sometimes
[06:52:40] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: I wasn't. Did you file an issue?
[06:53:40] <aaronmcadam> I was going to
[06:53:59] <aaronmcadam> I've also got a problem with opening dialogs, closing, then reopening
[06:54:09] <aaronmcadam> I think it's to do with the hashes being added
[06:54:23] <aaronmcadam> but i see that option has been deprecated in $.changepage
[06:55:11] <aaronmcadam> in the url I mean kinblas
[06:55:38] <aaronmcadam> it's when you tap the headings, I think it's when u tap 2 by mistake
[06:55:54] <aaronmcadam> I'll try and nail down a repeatable example
[06:56:01] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: what option are you relying on for changePage?
[06:56:21] <aaronmcadam> none kinblas
[06:56:28] <aaronmcadam> $.mobile.changePage( '#chooseAddress', 'pop' );
[06:56:55] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: $.mobile.changePage( '#chooseAddress', { transition: 'pop' } );
[06:56:58] <aaronmcadam> I meant I was going to try that old option
[06:57:14] <aaronmcadam> ok I'll try that
[06:57:26] <aaronmcadam> thanks for the help kinblas!
[06:57:32] <kinblas> the signature of changePage changed around beta 4
[06:57:41] <aaronmcadam> yeah I'm on .latest
[06:59:34] <aaronmcadam> ah that's stopping it appending, nice one kinblas
[07:00:04] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:00:59] <aaronmcadam> seems that if I open one, then close it using a link, then reopen it and use the X to close it, the preceeding dialog shows up again
[07:05:09] <aaronmcadam> ah, I need to specify which page to go back to don't I kinblas
[07:05:43] <aaronmcadam> is there a data-* attr i can use for that?
[07:05:50] <kinblas> aaronmcAdam data-rel="back"
[07:05:52] <kinblas> should do the trick
[07:05:59] <aaronmcadam> yeah that's not working
[07:06:08] <kinblas> but in theory the href for the <a> should be the page/div-id to go back to
[07:06:42] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: I just fixed a bug lastnight having to do with back not working when crossing from an external page to an internal page (div)
[07:06:45] <aaronmcadam> cool i just did a hard refresh, worked ok that time
[07:07:14] <kinblas> try testing against http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/ or the "latest"
[07:07:34] <aaronmcadam> I am using latest
[07:07:43] <aaronmcadam> is test newer?
[07:08:27] <aaronmcadam> right, it seems my data-rel anchor is working, but the X button is closing and then showing the dialog that was closed before the current one opened
[07:08:28] <aaronmcadam> if u follow
[07:08:54] <aaronmcadam> I'll try test now
[07:10:30] <aaronmcadam> hmm that's weird
[07:10:40] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: I'm not sure when "latest" is snapshot'ed but the /test/ URL above is always in sync with the HEAD after a checkin
[07:10:53] <aaronmcadam> right cool I'll use that going forward, thanks dude
[07:11:05] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: when you file an issue, it helps us tremendously if you have a sample
[07:11:17] <kinblas> that way we don't have to build one ourselves to recreate
[07:11:32] <aaronmcadam> yeah I understand that man
[07:11:42] <aaronmcadam> I'll try and abstract one
[07:11:51] <kinblas> aaronmcadam: ok, I gotta run I'll be back on in an hour or so
[07:11:57] <aaronmcadam> ok thanks a lot!
[07:12:03] <kinblas> no problem
[07:12:10] <kinblas> your welcome
[07:12:17] <kinblas> s/your/you're/
[07:12:44] <aaronmcadam> cool :D
[07:37:12] <aaronmcadam> typically enough I can't reproduce the problem in my abstraction lol

[08:17:42] <aaronmcadam> ah
[08:18:43] <aaronmcadam> ?tell kinblas The dialog issue was because the callback calling $.changePage was coming from an event firing twice! Thanks again!
[08:18:44] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Okay.
[08:52:12] <toddparker> hey all
[09:21:32] <_nickel> toddparker: how long does it take for the latest / daily build to update
[09:21:46] <_nickel> a fix I put in yesterday is missing
[09:42:39] <_nickel> toddparker: kinblas: yah neither, the daily/latest build nor the demo website has been updated with my changes from yesterday
[09:47:20] <toddparker> odd
[09:47:28] <toddparker> is the build script jammed up?
[09:47:40] <toddparker> that happened a while back, didn't it kinblas?
[09:47:48] <toddparker> eddiemonge - you around?
[09:49:43] <kinblas> toddparker: what happened a while back? The build script jam?
[09:49:43] <bot-t> (1 hour 31 mins ago) <aaronmcadam> tell kinblas The dialog issue was because the callback calling $.changePage was coming from an event firing twice! Thanks again!
[10:40:26] <_nickel> toddparker: maybe after 1.0 it would be good to get me involved with the build server/cdn
[10:40:40] <_nickel> toddmparker: ^
[11:20:22] <kinblas_> _nickel: woah, event /test/ is out of sync? I thought it was just the daily build snapshots
[11:20:55] <_nickel> yah
[11:21:06] <_nickel> I pointed someone else at it and it doesn't have changes from yesterday
[11:21:13] <kinblas_> _nickel: ew, yeah, you're right
[11:21:21] <kinblas_> my changes from lastnight/this morning aren't there
[11:22:14] <kinblas_> _nickel: yeah we need to get more folks on the team up to speed on how that stuff works so we can restart whatever services are necessary
[11:22:14] <_nickel> I need to get my hands into that stuff asap so we can solve these issues without bothering eddie
[11:22:23] <_nickel> jinx
[11:22:27] <_nickel> I'll email
[11:22:33] <kinblas_> okie dokie
[11:24:39] <_nickel> email sent
[11:25:06] <_nickel> kinblas_: also those test failures I thought were spurious on the adobe jqmci we're the failures you were describing
[11:25:20] <_nickel> so I turned it back on
[11:25:28] <toddparker> thanks _nickel
[11:26:28] <kinblas_> _nickel: I can take a look *again* to see if there's something I missed or broke with the original fix I made
[11:26:33] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #35: ABORTED in 15 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/35/
[11:26:48] <_nickel> thats me
[11:26:51] <_nickel> futzing
[11:27:01] <toddparker> k
[11:30:56] <kinblas_> _nickel: so about that failing test
[11:31:17] <kinblas_> _nickel: when I fixed it, I was fixing it by running unit/navigation/ directly
[11:31:30] <kinblas_> it *STILL* works there, but not in the /unit/ iframe case
[11:31:39] <kinblas_> perhaps that's a clue
[11:32:42] <_nickel> kinblas: I wouldn't worry about it for now
[11:32:46] <_nickel> obviously
[11:32:53] <_nickel> if it still fails for the ci
[11:32:55] <_nickel> then we might
[11:33:04] <_nickel> there are a lot of tests that fail in the iframe
[11:33:08] <kinblas> doesn't ci run /unit/?
[11:33:08] <_nickel> which need to be addressed
[11:33:12] <_nickel> kinblas: nope
[11:33:15] <kinblas> oh good
[11:33:15] <_nickel> I haven't updated it
[11:33:25] <_nickel> that will happen when i get all that sorted
[11:33:29] <kinblas> but I thought you said originate/hudson was still failing?
[11:33:34] <_nickel> kinblas: its frozen
[11:33:37] <kinblas> oh ok
[11:33:42] <kinblas> what about adobe/hudson?
[11:33:43] * _nickel has a love hate relationship with hudson
[11:33:46] <_nickel> kinblas: running now
[11:33:51] <_nickel> it appears to be passing
[11:34:00] <kinblas> so let's switch email notifications to that then?
[11:34:01] <_nickel> still have to wait and see though
[11:34:04] <_nickel> yep
[11:34:06] <_nickel> thats my plan
[11:34:08] <_nickel> :D
[11:34:13] <kinblas> ok
[11:34:35] * kinblas is writing a transition sample for apple
[11:34:43] <kinblas> I hate it when things work ok outside of jqm
[11:34:44] <_nickel> kinblas: oh snap
[11:35:09] <_nickel> bug in mobile safari?
[11:35:34] <kinblas> _nickel: yeah, rendering gets wonky when you click in a text control and then close the keyboard
[11:35:40] <kinblas> things start flickering like crazy
[11:35:45] <_nickel> sigh
[11:35:59] * _nickel hands Kin a machete
[11:36:02] <kinblas> heh
[11:36:04] <_nickel> into the amazon!
[11:36:27] <_nickel> why doesn't cmd-tab work properly on osx!
[11:36:29] <_nickel> WHY!
[11:36:42] <_nickel> this is driving me nuts
[11:47:05] <eTiger13> what is it not doing?
[11:47:18] <eTiger13> and im fixing the /test/ site right now and writing up how it works
[11:51:06] <eTiger13> can one of you add NOTES to .gitignore and then push it to master?
[11:54:20] <eTiger13> actually hold on a sec for pushing it
[12:01:30] <_nickel> eTiger13: when I tab between applications they often end up behind another application on the same workspace
[12:28:29] <eTiger13> ok now can someone add NOTES to ignore?
[12:31:18] <eTiger13> lol i also like .gitignore in .gitignore
[12:46:03] <eddiemonge> everyone here knows both of my nicks right?
[12:52:21] <_nickel> eddiemonge: did not
[12:52:23] <_nickel> but now I do :D
[12:52:48] <eddiemonge> my email make sense?
[13:02:12] <toddparker> thanks eddiemonge
[13:02:30] <toddparker> it's all gibberish to me, but _nickel and kinblas should get it
[13:02:54] <_nickel> eddiemonge: checking
[13:03:49] <eddiemonge> basically its just magic. bad magic, but magic
[13:10:58] <kinblas> eddiemonge: thanks for the email
[13:11:10] <kinblas> knowing what scripts are in the mix helps
[14:46:36] <eddiemonge> gseguin: are you going to the boston conf?

[14:56:31] <_nickel> that link will only work inside the adobe vpn
[14:57:16] <_nickel> emails should be showing up shortly for the build failures

[16:16:05] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2217 on jquery-mobile, reported by epsd (1m, 1w ago): pagecreate timing issue in beta 2
[16:16:14] <_nickel> toddparker: ^
[16:16:31] <_nickel> it looks like we will need to come up with a another event for widget use
[16:16:37] <_nickel> beforepagecreate or some such
[16:16:53] <_nickel> although thats semantically broken from my perspective
[16:17:05] <_nickel> it seems like these folks really want "afterpagecreate"
[16:17:18] <_nickel> but it would be a bummer to switch things out from under them like that
[16:17:51] <_nickel> maybe "pageenhance" is the right binding
[16:22:21] <_nickel> brb rebooting because nfsd has failed on os x

[16:43:36] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2217 on jquery-mobile, reported by epsd (1m, 1w ago): pagecreate timing issue in beta 2
[16:43:42] <nickel> I'm leaning towards a new event
[17:11:34] <kinblas> nickel: I commented in the bug
[17:12:18] <nickel> kinblas: alright I'll wait and we can chat a bit tomorro
[17:12:28] <kinblas> for Spry  we had phases (plugin-init, info-extraction, markup-transoformation, behavior-attachment, ready )
[17:12:39] <nickel> one big problem here is that we might have to monkey with the widget or do some acrobatics
[17:12:47] <kinblas> that provide enough hooks for plugins to do whatever they wanted
[17:13:39] <kinblas> nickel: ok we can chat more tomorrow, I have to run
[17:13:46] <nickel> kinblas: word
