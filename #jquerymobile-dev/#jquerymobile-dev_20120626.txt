[02:46:47] <agcolom> updates are now showing... the only thing missing is the version. It's currently not picking it up and shows dev (as it's not picking up a version). where is it picking it up from? )

[03:46:10] <agcolom> ok, I've got it. I need a '-' so 1.1.1 RC1 needs to be written 1.1.1-rc1 right?
[03:49:16] <agcolom> no, since it's only charAt( 0 ) that will go upper case, if I want RC1 I need it to be 1.1.1-RC1
[03:49:20] <agcolom> right?
[03:50:09] <agcolom> uGoMobi, Hi Are you around?
[03:50:26] <agcolom> are you running jqm on a local web server?
[03:50:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne, yes I am here
[03:50:56] <uGoMobi> yes
[03:51:26] <agcolom> Hi Excellent. Could you try something for me please?
[03:51:33] <uGoMobi> sure
[03:51:44] <agcolom> version.txt in your local version of 1.1-stable
[03:51:56] <agcolom> could you try to change it to 1.1.1-RC1
[03:52:09] <uGoMobi> ok
[03:52:17] <agcolom> and see if you get the correct ribbon label.
[03:54:17] <uGoMobi> I changed it and now the ribbon only shows "dev"
[03:55:09] <uGoMobi> actually, without changing it it also only shows "dev"
[03:55:31] <agcolom> yes, that's my problem at teh moment :-(
[03:56:02] <agcolom> because if the version is not defined it gets dev
[03:56:27] <uGoMobi> ok, I am checking whats going on
[03:57:00] <agcolom> var version = $.mobile.version || "dev",
[03:57:40] <agcolom> then I thought it was because the version.txt didn't habe a '-'
[03:57:43] <agcolom> have ^
[03:58:33] <uGoMobi> I am looking at that $.mobile.version in core.js now
[04:02:57] <agcolom> in 1.1-stable if I do an alert($.mobile.version); I get undefined. in master, I get 1.2-pre
[04:03:40] <agcolom> sorry I get 1.2.0-pre
[04:04:21] <agcolom> which is exactly what is in version.txt
[04:05:11] <agcolom> could the missing - be breaking it?
[04:06:46] <uGoMobi> nah, I don't think so
[04:08:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think it gets only added when you build
[04:09:25] <agcolom> Yes, that's why I can't test
[04:09:39] <agcolom> Do you think I should change it and see what happens?
[04:10:13] <uGoMobi> you can try, if nothing happens you can just revert it
[04:10:27] <agcolom> ok
[04:10:42] <uGoMobi> I don't think I can help you with this
[04:10:49] <uGoMobi> it's more something for johnbender
[04:11:21] <agcolom> ok, I've made the change... then it's wait and see

[04:11:27] <uGoMobi> I don't get the total picture of how this is working
[04:11:39] <agcolom> Thanks for you help anyway :-)

[04:38:10] <agcolom> uGoMobi: actually, it's like the term 'version' does not exist in 1.1-stable!
[04:39:00] <agcolom> when I do alert($.mobile.v in master, if offers version, but in 1.1-stable nothing at all.
[04:39:12] <agcolom> maybe there's a define missing??
[04:42:33] <agcolom> oh well, will wait until west coast guys wake up :-)
[07:04:28] <Wilto> Hey, that version flag dealie turn out alright?
[07:13:51] <agcolom> $.mobile.version is undefined in 1.1-stable :-(
[07:14:23] <Wilto> ?mlm
[07:14:24] <bot-t> much like myself
[07:14:38] <agcolom> Wilto ^ so not getting the right flag/ribbon value
[07:28:19] <Wilto> Huh. Why wouldnâ€™t that be there, I wonder?
[07:28:33] <Wilto> Are you cool with digging that up, or do you want me to have a look around?
[07:48:43] <agcolom> Would be great if you could have a look... I don't get at all why version is underfined!
[07:49:08] <agcolom> Also I am struggling a bit... I hurt my back really badly yesterday!
[07:50:15] <agcolom> sorry I meant undefined!
[07:51:26] <MauriceG> Hi all!
[07:51:36] <agcolom> Hi Maurice :-) How are you?
[07:52:26] <MauriceG> Hi Anne :-) Thanks. Busy but ok.  And you?
[07:53:12] <agcolom> I'm in pain :-( I've hurt my back yesterday! but otherwise good :-)
[07:53:57] <MauriceG> oh, sorry to hear :-(
[07:54:19] <MauriceG> Can you stay at home ?
[07:55:16] <agcolom> Yes, I did today and will again tomorrow...
[07:55:52] <agcolom> and thursday... luckily teaching is over... although I have a revision lecture friday.... Hope I'll be ok by then!
[07:57:08] <MauriceG> So get well soon!
[07:58:13] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[07:59:59] <MauriceG> agcolom: did you recognize that $.mobile.version is set on latest? It seems, it will just set "at home".
[08:00:36] <MauriceG> so for a local repo the banner just get the "dev"
[08:01:23] <johnbender> agcolom: Wilto: the version banner change wasn't included in 1.1-stable
[08:01:26] <johnbender> we need the image
[08:01:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to deploy 1.1.1-rc.1 without tagging or pushing the version.txt change to the main repo so you guys can test
[08:03:00] <johnbender> "main repo"
[08:03:02] * johnbender shakes his head
[08:03:04] <johnbender> origin
[08:03:50] <agcolom> I manually added all the changes yesterday as toddparker_ wanted the banner. The only change in the build is that in 1.1-stable we have version: __version__, and in master we have version: 1.2.0-pre
[08:04:16] <agcolom> but I can't work out what is missing...
[08:04:45] <agcolom> MauriceG did you find what was missing?
[08:06:16] <johnbender> agcolom: I don't think the build was updated to handle it
[08:06:36] <agcolom> ha!
[08:06:47] <johnbender> agcolom: it has to replace that value with the version txt
[08:07:18] <johnbender> agcolom: although I just deployed and all seems well
[08:07:19] <agcolom> ok, so what is the best thing to do?
[08:07:24] <johnbender> agcolom: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1-rc.1
[08:07:38] <agcolom> Cool!!!!
[08:07:44] <agcolom> Nearly there!
[08:08:11] <agcolom> I ported all the changes manually yesterday evening!
[08:08:28] <johnbender> agcolom: you must have snuck the build change in there as well then
[08:08:29] * johnbender checks
[08:08:49] <johnbender> yerp
[08:08:56] <agcolom> Ah, is that bad?
[08:09:30] <johnbender> agcolom: ? it seems to be working just fine
[08:09:42] <johnbender> yah
[08:09:43] <johnbender> it's in there
[08:09:48] <johnbender> and the version value is set
[08:09:57] <johnbender> what was the issue you were running in to?
[08:09:57] <agcolom> excellent ;)
[08:10:09] <agcolom> well I was not seeing the value. Now I can!
[08:10:16] <johnbender> agcolom: cool
[08:10:39] <agcolom> I was looking at branches/1.1-stable
[08:10:42] <johnbender> agcolom: ah it's undefined in development
[08:10:47] <johnbender> agcolom: ah yah
[08:10:53] <johnbender> that's just a copy of the source
[08:10:58] <johnbender> it tars up with branch and untars it
[08:11:00] <johnbender> no build
[08:11:04] <johnbender> :
[08:11:05] <johnbender> :(
[08:11:08] <johnbender> sorry for the confusio
[08:11:12] <johnbender> *confusion
[08:11:35] <agcolom> No problem, It got me to have a good look at the code :-)
[08:12:02] <agcolom> Now I thought it would say RC1 not Rc.1
[08:12:27] <MauriceG> yes ... agcolom: look odd a little Rc1
[08:13:18] <MauriceG> *looks
[08:13:37] <johnbender> agcolom: that's the semver format
[08:13:42] <agcolom> it is getting the value to lower case before it get the 1st character to upper case? (Because I used RC1 (all uppercase no .)
[08:13:43] <johnbender> dunno about the js that adds the banner
[08:13:54] <johnbender> rc.1
[08:13:59] <johnbender> 1.1.1-rc.1
[08:14:18] <agcolom> the js split where the - is
[08:14:25] <johnbender> I think it's initcapped for Alpha / Beta
[08:14:30] <agcolom> first word is as is
[08:14:42] <agcolom> second word gets 1st char uppercase
[08:14:58] <agcolom> is the value from version.txt?
[08:15:20] <johnbender> yah
[08:15:36] <johnbender> agcolom: I can make that change
[08:15:39] * johnbender needs to shower :(
[08:15:42] <johnbender> brb
[08:16:03] <toddmparker_> morning all
[08:16:30] <agcolom> ok, because in version.txt, I've put 1.1.1-RC1
[08:16:46] <agcolom> Hey toddmparker_ :-)
[08:16:52] <toddmparker_> hey agcolom
[08:16:55] <agcolom> We got the banner up ;-)
[08:16:59] <toddmparker_> yay
[08:17:17] <agcolom> just a tiny value issue but will get fixed ;-)
[08:17:29] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1-rc.1/
[08:17:40] <toddmparker_> you mean the version string for that?
[08:17:55] <agcolom> have a look at the ribbon/banner
[08:18:23] <agcolom> oh, and we need to update the licence.txt
[08:18:48] <agcolom> 1.1.1 Rc.1 doesn't look pretty
[08:18:55] <agcolom> We want 1.1.1 RC1
[08:19:08] <agcolom> (I think ?)
[08:20:15] <MauriceG> Hi toddparker_
[08:20:23] <uGoMobi> hi all
[08:20:46] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[08:20:51] <MauriceG> Yes, agcolom: we want RC1 :-)
[08:21:02] <MauriceG> Hi Jasper !
[08:21:05] <agcolom> Yeah!
[08:21:56] <MauriceG> Who put Rc.1 there?
[08:22:23] <agcolom> Noone :-) apparently it's server format
[08:22:36] <agcolom> johnbender will fix that I think
[08:23:10] <MauriceG> I think, he was ;-)
[08:33:38] <agcolom> Have we lost toddmparker_ ?
[08:49:03] <gseguin> agcolom: did you cherry-pick the change for the ribbon in the docs?
[08:49:31] <agcolom> gseguin I did all manually...
[08:50:02] <agcolom> Sorry that's probably terrible practice!!!
[08:50:52] <gseguin> that's ok
[08:51:05] <gseguin> though it's weird 'cause it's displaying dev
[08:51:08] <agcolom> but it looks like I didn't forget anything...
[08:51:23] <gseguin> which basically happens when the version is not there I think
[08:51:25] <gseguin> let me check
[08:51:41] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1-rc.1/
[08:52:05] <agcolom> the ribbon is there now... we just have a formatting issue
[08:52:11] <agcolom> gseguin ^
[08:52:12] <gseguin> oh you guys already tagged
[08:52:43] <toddmparker_> here i am
[08:52:50] <agcolom> euh... is that what johnbender did? (sorry what does tagging mean?)
[08:53:06] <toddmparker_> agcolom: yes, 1.1.1 RC1 for the banner text
[08:53:57] <agcolom> Hey toddmparker_ we need to update licence.txt
[08:54:09] <toddmparker_> maybe johnbender did tag it this morning. i told him we were ready to go, didn't realize there was still and issue with the flag
[08:54:23] <toddmparker_> agcolom: ok. what needs updating?
[08:55:17] <agcolom> Copyright 2011 (c) jQuery Project (LICENSE-INFO.txt)
[08:55:21] <toddmparker_> anything else we need to fix in the 1.1-stable branch to tag this?
[08:55:26] <toddmparker_> ah.
[08:55:43] <toddmparker_> ok agcolom - are you going to change that to match the footer?
[08:55:49] <toddmparker_> good catch.
[08:55:56] <agcolom> I was thinking that
[08:56:09] <agcolom> also Copyright (c) 2011 John Resig, http://jquery.com/ (MIT-LICENSE.txt)
[08:56:22] <agcolom> would that need updating too?

[08:59:37] <agcolom> gseguin, yes I didn't know the branches/1.1-stable was a non built! So I've been trying to understand why it was't working!
[09:00:08] <gseguin> yeah it just picks up the source code
[09:00:13] <gseguin> it doesn't build it
[09:00:23] <agcolom> So I've learnt something new :-) That's good :-)

[09:02:29] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: thanks for tweaking the margins for the close button. that was bugging me too.
[09:03:20] <toddmparker_> We're going to do a full device test on the 1.1.1 build today in the lab to make sure there's no unexpected issues
[09:03:48] <toddmparker_> I don't anticipate any, but I want to fully test before releasing
[09:04:40] <toddmparker_> can we use the branch preview to test or should I do a local version? Any difference you can think of?
[09:04:51] <toddmparker_> preview is better because I can make a short URL
[09:07:46] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I didn't tag it
[09:07:50] <johnbender> just deployed
[09:08:11] <johnbender> if we want to tag on a different commit I can just redeploy and refresh the cdn

[09:23:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] prevent init cap of rc version in docs js - John Bender
[09:23:47] <gseguin> it creates a new copy of $.mobile
[09:23:53] <gseguin> that's not good
[09:24:13] <johnbender> gseguin: lol
[09:24:39] <johnbender> gseguin: so what was the reason for the extension? just to make sure we don't steamroll other people's implementations
[09:25:10] <gseguin> exactly
[09:25:42] <johnbender> gseguin: I would just too an ||=
[09:25:48] <johnbender> it's clunky but it works fine
[09:26:02] <johnbender> $.mobile.blah = $.mobile.blah || function(){ }
[09:26:21] <johnbender> that's what I did with the loader widget
[09:26:22] <gseguin> I think $.extend( $.mobile, { getMaxScrollForTransition: function() {} }, $.mobile } should work
[09:26:36] <johnbender> gseguin: kk, if you do that would you mind adding a comment
[09:26:40] <gseguin> or  ||
[09:26:45] <johnbender> it confuses my tiny peebrain
[09:27:00] <gseguin> will do
[09:30:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so I'm still unclear should I tag yet?

[09:46:33] <toddmparker_> i'm here
[09:46:35] <toddmparker_> grabbed food
[09:46:56] <agcolom> johnbender can we make the banner 1.1.1 RC1 ?
[09:46:56] <toddmparker_> so johnbender  do you need to re-deploy after gseguin's change?
[09:48:19] <agcolom> Sorry, I'm finding this whole thing terribly exciting! I missed it all last time as I was on holiday...
[09:51:14] <agcolom> johnbender: sorry the last license change I made was in master... just need to cherry pick
[09:52:00] <toddmparker_> agcolom - it is exciting. wish there was a big red button to deploy
[09:52:24] <toddmparker_> johnbender: seems like we just need to tweak the version flag to be RC, not Rc
[09:52:42] <toddmparker_> and we need agcolom's license change
[09:52:52] <toddmparker_> so I guess we need a re-build
[09:52:59] <toddmparker_> andrew here is testing: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1-rc.1/
[09:53:01] <toddmparker_> now
[09:53:12] <toddmparker_> can you all test the CDN links?
[09:53:15] <toddmparker_> and zip?
[09:53:27] <toddmparker_> once the new build is up
[09:53:53] <johnbender> toddmparker_: agcolom so you guys want caps RC?
[09:54:01] <toddmparker_> i will ve in a meeting for the next 2 hours so if I disappear, you'll know why
[09:54:05] <toddmparker_> yes please johnbender

[09:57:49] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] updated to 2011-12 (c) The jQuery Foundation - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[09:57:54] <agcolom> ok, this time I think I'm all done!
[09:58:33] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/26alWw
[09:58:33] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] full upper case for rc tag - John Bender
[09:59:16] <johnbender> bumping version
[09:59:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/JVWjaQ
[09:59:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] full upper case for rc tag - John Bender
[09:59:21] <johnbender> deploying
[09:59:47] <gseguin> drum roll
[09:59:57] <johnbender> gseguin: no drum roll
[10:00:04] <johnbender> I'm not going to push that until I get the go ahead :D
[10:01:08] <johnbender> agcolom: for the version.txt we try to follow the semver conventions and our previous releases
[10:01:14] <johnbender> so this release will be 1.1.1-rc.1
[10:01:30] <johnbender> we can handle the formatting in the js
[10:01:37] <agcolom> Ok, shall I change that then?
[10:01:41] <johnbender> agcolom: nope
[10:01:42] <johnbender> let me do that
[10:01:44] <johnbender> when I deploy
[10:02:03] <toddmparker_> anyone have any last minute requests?
[10:02:04] <johnbender> agcolom: because we want to tag version txt change in git
[10:02:06] <agcolom> ok
[10:02:11] <toddmparker_> or are we good to deploy?
[10:02:14] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes
[10:02:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: deploying now and then I can push the tag if you want
[10:02:32] <toddmparker_> that would be good
[10:02:41] <toddmparker_> so we can fix something is needed
[10:02:53] <toddmparker_> and i want to keep this on the down low until we want o announce
[10:03:01] <toddmparker_> thanks everyone
[10:03:18] <toddmparker_> looking good
[10:03:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ok, so I'm not going to tag and push until later then
[10:03:33] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi and I are making some popup styling tweaks today
[10:03:33] <johnbender> in case we get fixes
[10:03:39] <toddmparker_> ya
[10:03:40] <johnbender> we can tag whenever we feel like
[10:03:44] <toddmparker_> perfect
[10:06:50] <agcolom> So from now, if we pull in PRs (say in the docs). They only go in master?
[10:07:12] <johnbender> agcolom: depends
[10:07:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: are we going to do another maintenance release?
[10:07:21] <gseguin> it depends if we are planning for a 1.1.2
[10:07:42] <johnbender> I'd still like to do those more frequently
[10:08:08] <agcolom> ok, so is it best to hold for a bit until we decide?
[10:08:09] <johnbender> I think we delayed this last one because we were hoping scott would be able to work on a specific bug
[10:08:12] <johnbender> agcolom: yah
[10:08:22] <johnbender> alternately we can just create a branch for you if you want
[10:08:34] <agcolom> (nothing major really)
[10:08:45] <johnbender> 1.1.1-stable lol
[10:08:59] <johnbender> 1.1-interim
[10:09:01] <johnbender> or something
[10:09:09] <toddmparker_> probably will be a 1.1.2
[10:09:10] <johnbender> and then we can merge that back in after the release
[10:09:13] <johnbender> kk
[10:09:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll create a branch
[10:09:29] <johnbender> anyone have a problem with 1.1-interim
[10:09:38] <johnbender> which will get merged into 1.1-stable once we do the release?
[10:09:43] <johnbender> and we're happy with it
[10:09:57] <johnbender> I'll send out a message on basecamp
[10:10:15] <gseguin> why is 1.1-stable not enough?
[10:10:20] <agcolom> Happy to wait... then I can work on the api docs...
[10:10:34] <johnbender> gseguin: we want to cherry pick and continue work on the stable branch
[10:11:03] <johnbender> but we want to keep the current state of 1.1-stable for finaly changes / deployment since it's being tested
[10:11:15] <gseguin> ok
[10:11:51] <johnbender> gseguin: so for simplicity's sake we can just use the other branch I'm creating for deploying and quick fixes
[10:12:06] <johnbender> 1.1.1
[10:12:10] <johnbender> ^
[10:12:22] <johnbender> I guess it would be stable
[10:12:25] <johnbender> 1.1.1-stable
[10:12:32] <agcolom> guys, there was something else I notice that wasn't in 1.1-stable... is that ok? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a203036417a57b8e82415f1e38959b6c8cd254f4#js/jquery.mobile.core.js
[10:12:32] <johnbender> and then just let everyone continue work on 1.1-stable as normal
[10:12:32] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery-mobile by Ghislain Seguin (1w, 4d ago): Moved depend! and text! plugins into js directory
[10:12:54] <toddmparker_> great
[10:13:21] <agcolom> (Is that ok that it's not there)
[10:14:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: hrm, downside though is that we have to cherry pick changes between three branches possible
[10:15:04] <johnbender> and the the tag will be on this third branch :(_
[10:15:07] <johnbender> which isn't great
[10:18:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: lets do this
[10:18:24] <johnbender> nevermidn
[10:19:19] <johnbender> hmm
[10:19:31] <johnbender> it might just be easier for folks to keep their changes local until we tag it
[10:19:34] <johnbender> :(
[10:19:43] <johnbender> and then just do anothe rc if we come up with stuff
[10:20:35] <johnbender> and then just eat the possible issue of introducing new bugs with bug fixes
[10:20:42] <johnbender> which has, historically, been fairly low
[10:30:30] <gseguin> agcolom: yeah that commit is just for master
[10:30:41] <gseguin> it goes along with the code re-org
[10:32:00] <agcolom> ok, thanks :-)
[10:39:33] <johnbender> gseguin: still not sure what to do about this branch situation
[10:39:53] <johnbender> honestly it's probably just easier to let people do what they want after we tag it
[10:40:26] <johnbender> otherwise we might end up cherry picking three branches while we do rc's
[10:40:41] <johnbender> (in the case where a bug is found that should be fixed in all three
[10:40:59] <gseguin> Yeah I think it's not too big of a deal to have only -stable
[10:41:08] <johnbender> agreed
[10:41:11] <johnbender> agcolom: uGoMobi:
[10:41:25] <johnbender> just keep your changes local until I push the tag
[10:41:31] <gseguin> we just have to keep this RC cycle short
[10:41:36] <johnbender> yah
[10:41:42] <johnbender> which would be good
[10:44:46] <agcolom> ok.... so changes local. and PRs in master? or we don't touch PRs for now?
[10:54:53] <gseguin> agcolom: PRs are ok to land on master, just keep track of the ones you would want to cherry-pick to 1.1-stable for the next maintenance release
[10:57:50] <MauriceG> agcolom: sorry, I was busy. Do you like the banner as it is now? On Safari (Win) it looks odd (RC1 is b: font-wight: bolder; -> user style-sheet) must be: bold
[11:00:31] <uGoMobi> johnb
[11:00:53] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, won't touch 1.1-stable
[11:02:43] <MauriceG> a tiny tweak in jqm-doc.css makes it look like this: http://maugo.ma.funpic.de/jqm111rc1.png
[11:02:53] <MauriceG> agocolom: ^^
[11:09:35] <agcolom> MariceG, all looking good on Mac... Do you have a screen shot of the one on Windows?
[11:09:49] <agcolom> Sorry I meant MauriceG ^
[11:10:16] <agcolom> I think we're not touching things anymore for this version.
[11:13:09] <MauriceG> I've tested on Safari OSX, Opera, FF, iPad 2, Opera mobile emu: all looks ok, just Safari on Win looks odd ...  screen shot on the way. One moment please ...
[11:15:57] <agcolom> oh yes, no rush :-)
[11:16:13] <MauriceG> agocolom: Banner Safari Win: http://maugo.ma.funpic.de/jqm111rc1win.png
[11:16:36] <agcolom> yuck!
[11:17:44] <MauriceG> I've changed:  .jqm-version b { font-weight: bold; ... }  and it looks like on OSX
[11:18:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: MauriceG :I don't see that issue here on Safari/Win
[11:19:00] <agcolom> which version of Safari do you have?
[11:19:25] <uGoMobi> this was 5.1.7 for Win
[11:19:37] <MauriceG> 5.0.5 on win
[11:21:04] <agcolom> Ah! Maurice, would it be time for an upgrade? ;-)
[11:22:34] <uGoMobi> I suggest to look into it later, when all this deploy/tag/new branches stuff is behind us
[11:23:01] <uGoMobi> We can change that < b > element
[11:23:02] <MauriceG> no... I don't like the look of the web inspector in 5.1.7 ...
[11:23:26] <MauriceG> agcolom: iPad 1 ?
[11:23:33] <MauriceG> you or me ?
[11:25:03] <agcolom> I can look at iPad 1 5.1 iPad 2 4.3.3 and 2 others but can't remember the os!
[11:25:16] <agcolom> I'll look at 4.3.3 first.
[11:25:39] <MauriceG> ok  I've an iPad 1 with 4...
[11:27:30] <MauriceG> iPad 3 5.1 ok
[11:27:42] <agcolom> iPad 2 4.3.3 all good
[11:28:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: how long do we keep deprecated features in the docs?
[11:28:27] <uGoMobi> was looking at this http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1-rc.1/docs/pages/touchoverflow.html
[11:28:27] <agcolom> iPad 1 5.1 all ok as well
[11:28:52] <agcolom> current and one more
[11:30:07] <uGoMobi> ok thanks, then it's ok
[11:30:27] <MauriceG> android 2.2.1 also ok ...  It seems, it's just my lovely Safari 5.0.5 on Win ...
[11:31:54] <MauriceG> sorry, I thought it looks like that generally ...
[11:32:02] <agcolom> I just got my hands on an Android device too :-) And I have a Window Phone in my colleague's locker as well which I hope to be able to use as well for testing :-)
[11:32:04] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: how does it look on Commodore 64?
[11:32:55] <uGoMobi> "I have a Window Phone in my colleague's locker" lol @ I have
[11:34:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: dont forget to ask before you grab it ;-)
[11:34:24] <agcolom> yes :-) ok, There is a Windows Phone in my colleague's locker (donated by microsoft) for which I have expressed interest ;-)
[11:35:30] <agcolom> Excellent That was my subconscious talking no doubt ;-)
[11:35:41] <uGoMobi> haha
[11:38:02] <agcolom> Now, don't laugh! My colleague lent me an Android phone.... I couldn't unlock it... (tried several times today). Then I leave it with my daughter and an hour later she's still with it playing games! Obviously she had no problem unlocking it! the UI just wasn't giving me any clues while she understood it straight away!
[11:39:34] <uGoMobi> sliding the lock... I agree it's not good UI
[11:39:53] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: finally the C64 loaded the page and it looks ok :-)
[11:40:08] <uGoMobi> lol MauriceG , good to know
[11:40:12] <agcolom> I was just touching the lock....
[11:40:20] <agcolom> but nothing was happening!
[11:40:49] <uGoMobi> yup, took me a minute too when after I started my phone first time
[11:42:28] <uGoMobi> have been browsing the RC1 docs and didn't see anything odd :)
[11:44:04] <MauriceG> me too (just the banner ;-)
[11:56:19] <gseguin> what about the banner?
[11:56:44] * gseguin obviously is not following the convo
[11:58:11] <uGoMobi> gseguin: nothing, it just didn't look good on MauriceG his Safari v1.dust browser
[12:02:02] <toddmparker_> we should remove deprecated features after a release
[12:03:40] <toddmparker_> sorry, i'll be 100% back in a few
[12:03:48] <toddmparker_> how goes?
[12:04:14] <toddmparker_> johnbender: once we tag 1.1.1, can we continue picking fixes over to 1.1.2
[12:05:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/r_sE7w
[12:05:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Corrected wrong ID on form example. - Jasper de Groot
[12:05:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Negate the ui-field-contain (min-width 450px) styles for popup. - Jasper de Groot
[12:07:30] <toddmparker_> so 1.1.1 looks great
[12:07:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes!!
[12:07:47] <uGoMobi> nice work all !!!
[12:09:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: so if I understood you right http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1-rc.1/docs/pages/touchoverflow.html should not have been in 1.1.1 docs?
[12:09:32] <uGoMobi> since it was deprecated in 1.1
[12:12:23] <agcolom> toddmparker_ I thought deprecated in the docs was current plus one more...??
[12:15:48] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am in favor of adding "custom select menu" to the left navmenu below "select menu", what do you say?
[12:17:09] <uGoMobi> I think it's a too nice feature to hide behind a link at the bottom of the (native) select menu page
[12:18:43] <agcolom> toddmparker_ ^ what do you think?
[12:19:18] <agcolom> uGoMobi, so you'd copy the relevant options/methods and events? I like the idea
[12:19:41] <agcolom> lets see what toddmparker_ says
[12:20:30] <uGoMobi> pages will be exactly the same as it is now, but the link will be in the navmenu
[12:20:47] <uGoMobi> still can keep that link at bottom of select menu page
[12:23:50] <uGoMobi> agco
[12:24:10] <agcolom> Ok, but if you don't copy/duplicate the pages, which left menu item will be "active" if you select options in custom select?
[12:24:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you are right have to give options/methods/events a look to see what is relevant
[12:24:58] <agcolom> I think if we do the menu item, we need to create the 4 pages (most will be identical content)
[12:25:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, I think that would be best
[12:26:27] <uGoMobi> so that is something to check careful, just wanted to know what others think about it
[12:32:58] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/ewvg7Q
[12:32:58] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Styles only for close buttons that are direct children of the popup element, otherwise it breaks the close button in the custom selectmenu header. - Jasper de Groot
[12:48:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/EgTgiw
[12:48:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Switching to square checkboxes for multiple select menu. - Jasper de Groot
[12:51:07] <maxlynch> Hey guys, we just released some open source icons for jqm on github, I'd love feedback: https://github.com/mlynch/codiqa-jquerymobile-icons
[12:52:20] <maxlynch> toddmparker_: the iconsize hack to buttonMarkup is in that repo as well: https://github.com/mlynch/codiqa-jquerymobile-icons/blob/master/ios-color/jquerymobile-buttonmarkup.js
[12:52:43] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: cool, wil have a look!
[12:52:43] <uGoMobi> will*
[12:52:58] <maxlynch> Cool, thanks :)
[12:55:13] <agcolom> Very nice :-)
[12:56:14] <agcolom> I've noticed you have an ios-color folder... are you planning on providing these in different colors?
[12:56:46] <maxlynch> agcolom: yea, there will be many different kinds
[12:57:03] <maxlynch> Also, I want to find a way to add more generic icon support into jam proper
[12:57:05] <maxlynch> jqm*
[12:57:56] <maxlynch> this pack uses another data property called data-iconsize to override some of the default 18x18 stuff jqm expects
[12:59:28] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: I agree that it would be nice to make it easier to use different icon sizes
[13:01:35] <maxlynch> uGoMobi: yea, Todd had mentioned it to me. I modified buttonMarkup to support that property, so I'd be curious to get opinions on that approach to incorporate into the framework
[13:01:37] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: forked your repo and will try them out to see how much css needs to be tweaked to display them right
[13:01:58] <maxlynch> uGoMobi: I mentioned it in the blog, but they pretty much just work on buttons for now
[13:02:17] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:02:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I figure we should just keep picking stuff over and in the case that the we need to do another rc things will just be "better"
[13:02:27] <uGoMobi> nice icon sprite btw !
[13:02:37] <johnbender> historically we haven't seen too many issues with minor bug fixes causing problesm
[13:04:41] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: I think the biggest issue is all those padding rules that need to be adjusted if the icon is bigger
[13:06:59] <MauriceG> maxlynch: very nice. I believe, uGoMobi will find a way
[13:07:20] <maxlynch> uGoMobi: yea, it's kind of a pain. I have some initial changes for button top/left/right/bottom, but it doesn't touch on the other places. I don't know if it's sufficient to just support a few hard-coded sizes, I can't think of a better way beyond calculating image sizes on the fly
[13:09:10] <johnbender> tagging and pushing
[13:09:16] <johnbender> err
[13:09:16] <johnbender> well
[13:09:18] <johnbender> maybe not
[13:09:23] <uGoMobi> johnbender: WHOEHOE!!
[13:09:26] <uGoMobi> err
[13:09:28] <johnbender> lol
[13:09:32] <uGoMobi> :D
[13:09:37] <johnbender> I thought todd said something about waiting on that until later
[13:09:48] <johnbender> pushing the version bump anyhow
[13:10:00] <uGoMobi> (I won't tell anyone ;-) )
[13:10:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/Z7afIA
[13:10:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] correct rc version number - John Bender
[13:10:30] <agcolom> We I made the changes for the licence, so all ok on my side
[13:10:37] <agcolom> Well ^
[13:11:07] <uGoMobi> welcome 1.1.1 RC 1
[13:11:37] <uGoMobi> I think we should do a 1.1.1 RC 1.1 as well... just because it looks funny :D
[13:16:28] <MauriceG> yes, and the url nice to enter   1.1.1-rc.1.1  (iOS especially ...)
[13:17:33] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: touchOverflow should be removed in 1.3
[13:17:50] <toddmparker_> it was deprecated in 1.1 so we leave it in for one more release
[13:17:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: ah ok, clear
[13:17:55] <toddmparker_> i think anyway, new at this
[13:18:02] <toddmparker_> johnbender: make sense?
[13:18:14] <toddmparker_> or should we remove that in 1.2 (master)
[13:18:37] <uGoMobi> main releases, not maintenance releases
[13:18:59] <toddmparker_> re: custom select menu, I'm torn. It's a nice feature but it's sloooow
[13:19:17] <uGoMobi> yeah I noticed that on Android
[13:19:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah that's fine
[13:19:26] <johnbender> two is good
[13:20:26] <johnbender> toddmparker_: semver recommends doing it in a major release
[13:20:30] <toddmparker_> maxlynch: those icons are hawt
[13:20:34] <johnbender> but ours are so far appart two minor releases seems fine
[13:20:36] <toddmparker_> is there a live demo page?
[13:20:38] <MauriceG> toddparker_  I remember, may 8 months ago, you told me, not to emphasize custom select too much in the docs
[13:20:52] <toddmparker_> MauriceG: yes, i did
[13:21:00] <MauriceG> but: they are very nice!
[13:21:44] <MauriceG> and if they're slow, there is more time to enjoy them
[13:21:50] <toddmparker_> johnbender: so we could remove that in 1.2? or you mean 2.0?
[13:22:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we should wait 2 minor versions I think
[13:22:11] <toddmparker_> ok, so 1.3
[13:22:16] <toddmparker_> that's what I was thinking
[13:22:17] <uGoMobi> obviously there are pros and cons so lets leave the custom select menu page link where it is now
[13:22:25] <uGoMobi> maybe wait for better processors :)
[13:24:08] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: yeah, let's wait but i'm open to discussing
[13:24:15] <toddmparker_> we need a good way to handle extensions
[13:24:24] <toddmparker_> like this
[13:24:44] <toddmparker_> maxlynch: i'd love to make it easier to use any standard icons across the board
[13:25:12] <toddmparker_> if you want to work with us to get some improvements into the mainline, it would be super
[13:25:12] <maxlynch> toddmparker_: no demo page yet, though there is an example in the repo. Yea, I would love to help make that happen
[13:25:43] <toddmparker_> johnbender: let's try to not pull over too many changes into 1.1-stable after RC1
[13:26:03] <toddmparker_> thought we were going to do some legit RCs :)
[13:26:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: will try maxlynch his icon sprite on a local branch and see what css needs to be tweaked
[13:26:25] <uGoMobi> then i can look into how we can simplefy that
[13:26:26] <toddmparker_> great uGoMobi
[13:26:32] <toddmparker_> i'd love to get that in for 1.3
[13:26:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: indeed, the downside of splitting of another branch is that we have 3 branches to cherry pick to possibly
[13:26:45] <johnbender> if there's something that needs to go into the rc it has to go into the other branches as well
[13:26:53] <toddmparker_> i see
[13:27:02] <johnbender> just ends up being a pain in the ass
[13:27:11] <johnbender> unless there aren't any fixes
[13:27:16] <johnbender> in which case it's still just 2 branches
[13:27:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: up to you really
[13:27:26] <johnbender> I'm fine with doing it either way
[13:27:35] <toddmparker_> we should try to move fast in releasing 1.1.1, it'll make the pain worse
[13:28:02] <toddmparker_> could we pick over changes to 1.1-stable from master after the fact once 1.1.1 goes final>
[13:28:52] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: I will let you know when I start working on the icons so we can discuss things here
[13:29:05] <maxlynch> uGoMobi: sure, I'll be idling
[13:29:11] <uGoMobi> cool
[13:30:34] <toddmparker_> johnbender: just checking...1.1.1 should be all set except for tagging it and doing the blog post
[13:30:37] <toddmparker_> right?
[13:31:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: unless commits have gone in since the last deploy
[13:31:42] <toddmparker_> last change was yours
[13:31:49] <toddmparker_> for the RC flag
[13:31:55] <toddmparker_> so I think we're good
[13:32:06] <johnbender> yar
[13:32:34] <toddmparker_> so for the conference, i'd like to show the popup
[13:32:48] <agcolom> Cool!!!! +1 from me!!!!
[13:33:05] <toddmparker_> if we wanted to package master as 1.2 alpha, is that just a matter of tagging it and doing a build?
[13:33:24] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: are the popup tweaks looking good?
[13:33:27] <toddmparker_> i can test
[13:33:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I need time to make sure the deploy works properly
[13:33:51] <johnbender> but if the commits that are there are satisfactory that'd be fine
[13:33:52] <toddmparker_> for 1.1.1?
[13:33:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: for 1.2
[13:34:03] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[13:34:11] <toddmparker_> looking at master now
[13:34:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I think we might want to wait
[13:34:29] <johnbender> people will overlook the 1.1 patch release in favor of a 1.2 alpa
[13:34:50] <johnbender> and it would be good to have the eyes on the patch release if possible
[13:35:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I think so, just an issue with max-height
[13:35:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: http://ugomobi.github.com/popup/popup.html#page-b see second example there
[13:35:54] <toddmparker_> the padding looks great now
[13:36:01] <uGoMobi> ok good
[13:36:04] <toddmparker_> i need to kill that slider example
[13:36:21] <toddmparker_> agcolom: can you add your map example to that page?
[13:37:10] <agcolom> sure...
[13:37:10] <agcolom> uGoMobi, is it best I send you the code?
[13:37:36] <uGoMobi> yeah, if you want
[13:37:51] <uGoMobi> but you can also put it in the docs directly
[13:38:35] <uGoMobi> does it require API key?
[13:38:54] <uGoMobi> be careful... over 25k views a day and Google will make you pay
[13:39:13] <uGoMobi> since we have 1.000.000 unique visitors a month ;-)
[13:39:17] <agcolom> no no need for API key in v3
[13:39:22] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:39:48] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/okehir/81
[13:39:58] <toddmparker_> simpler close button example
[13:39:59] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[13:40:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/zYaGsg
[13:40:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Simplified popup with close button example. - toddparker
[13:40:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: about the close button... now its exactly at the corner
[13:40:36] <uGoMobi> maybe still a bit too much to the edge
[13:40:41] <toddmparker_> yeah, the video and map examples are cool agcolom
[13:40:51] <toddmparker_> lemme look uGoMobi
[13:41:25] <agcolom> the video is not working on everything though
[13:41:26] <uGoMobi> yeah agcolom I really like those examples!
[13:41:29] <toddmparker_> yeah, it is a tad more offset
[13:41:39] <toddmparker_> makes sense mathematically, not visually
[13:42:09] <uGoMobi> shift the close button a bit?
[13:42:33] <agcolom> yes. What can't a div be centered horizontally? That's really missing!
[13:42:43] <toddmparker_> i think so...what do you think?
[13:42:59] <toddmparker_> yeah. i thought _|Nix|_
[13:43:03] <toddmparker_> had a way to do this
[13:43:11] <toddmparker_> but i don't know if it's exposed
[13:43:17] <toddmparker_> but I agree
[13:43:55] <uGoMobi> re close button position... i think so too
[13:44:09] <uGoMobi> when you have inline button the popup is not centered
[13:44:14] <uGoMobi> is that what you mean?
[13:45:44] <toddmparker_> normally, popups open over where you tap
[13:45:47] <agcolom> uGoMobi: If the question is for me, I mean there is no option in CSS to say align: center for divs
[13:46:01] <toddmparker_> but for larger popups, it woudl be nice to have it centered in the window
[13:46:06] <toddmparker_> yeah
[13:46:13] <agcolom> (I struggled to align the div in the center of the popup
[13:46:15] <toddmparker_> there is an x,y option
[13:47:15] <toddmparker_> but i wish there was a way to say center this sucker
[13:47:57] <johnbender> parent -> text-align: center, child -> margin: auto;
[13:47:58] <johnbender> ?
[13:48:10] * johnbender says the CSS n00b
[13:48:22] <toddmparker_> i mean via option or class on the popup
[13:48:26] <johnbender> ah!
[13:48:33] <toddmparker_> to center the whole schebang
[13:48:35] * johnbender goes back into his cave to work on his presentation
[13:48:37] <agcolom> toddmparker_ you can show the video popup on a desktop browser but not on a mobile device. It's not the right video format
[13:48:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: doesn't it transplant the styles?
[13:49:20] <toddmparker_> gotcha agcolom - let's skip that and just do the map
[13:49:34] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/methods.html
[13:49:43] <toddmparker_> there isn't an easy way to center something vertically anyway
[13:50:09] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: saw that
[13:50:18] <toddmparker_> so you can set hard-coded x,y
[13:50:37] <toddmparker_> but it would be nice to jsut say "instead of opening over the thing I tapped, center it"
[13:50:49] <toddmparker_> maybe there is a way to add this, dunno
[13:51:01] <uGoMobi> dunno either
[13:51:01] <toddmparker_> a dialog or lightbox should be centered
[13:51:16] <uGoMobi> already had problems to solve that max height thing
[13:51:30] <uGoMobi> new close button position http://ugomobi.github.com/popup/popup.html#page-b
[13:51:48] <uGoMobi> might have to refresh couple of time because of cache
[13:52:17] <toddmparker_> wow, looks awesome
[13:52:31] <toddmparker_> mind adding those examples to the docs. way better than the photo I used
[13:52:47] <toddmparker_> those could replace my lame close button example
[13:52:57] <uGoMobi> sure, but I dont know how I got them (copyright?)
[13:53:13] <toddmparker_> ah
[13:53:16] <toddmparker_> nevermind
[13:53:47] <toddmparker_> anyone have a cc licensed photo we can use
[13:55:13] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/okehir/85/ Todd, the video works (sorry I forgot I did that). Look on an iPad... looks great!
[13:55:29] <toddmparker_> cool agcolom
[13:55:57] <toddmparker_> let's add it then
[13:56:09] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: we can pick a vertical and horizontal image here - http://www.openstockphotography.org/
[13:56:09] <agcolom> Yes!
[13:56:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Wj-m7Q
[13:56:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Reposition the popup close buttons. - Jasper de Groot
[13:56:56] <agcolom> you want normal size photos?
[13:58:17] <toddmparker_> rather - http://www.flickr.com/search/groups/?q=nature&m=pool&w=83823859%40N00&z=t
[13:59:58] <toddmparker_> agcolom: be nice to have a good quality image that looks immersive on desktop
[14:00:10] <uGoMobi> just pick landscape picture so you dont see the issue with the max height
[14:00:15] <toddmparker_> one portrait and one landscape
[14:01:01] <uGoMobi> but if you open the portrait one on your phone it won't look good
[14:02:10] <toddmparker_> http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/3905166721/lightbox/
[14:02:56] <toddmparker_> portrait just shrinks down too much uGoMobi?
[14:04:10] <toddmparker_> i see uGoMobi - you get extra space to the right of the photo?
[14:04:30] <toddmparker_> so i agree with johnbender that popup still has some kinks to work out
[14:04:48] <uGoMobi> nah, its just that when picture is higher than screen height it touches the top and bottom edge with a bit scroll because the 1px border on the popup container
[14:04:58] <toddmparker_> so rather than post an alpha this week, i'll just point people to /test/ for a preview and we can shoot for an alpha next week
[14:05:08] <toddmparker_> i'd like to figure out centering
[14:05:15] <toddmparker_> and that portrait image thing
[14:05:35] <toddmparker_> i see uGoMobi
[14:05:37] <toddmparker_> not too bad
[14:05:49] <toddmparker_> but let's keep jamming on popup to refine the docs and demos
[14:05:58] <uGoMobi> I have been looking into the JS size/position logic but didn't figure it all out yet
[14:06:10] <toddmparker_> agcolom: are you adding those other demos?
[14:06:17] <toddmparker_> they look cool
[14:06:28] <agcolom> which ones? video and map?
[14:06:28] <uGoMobi> I am adding the map example now
[14:06:34] <agcolom> to the docs?
[14:06:37] <uGoMobi> lets not both work in same file
[14:07:16] <toddmparker_> good point uGoMobi
[14:08:04] <toddmparker_> yes agcolom, would like to add the map and video to the docs page and add the better photo examples uGoMobi worked out but with cc images
[14:08:23] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: if you're making edits to that page, agcolom can wait
[14:08:25] <agcolom> ok. Just in master
[14:08:33] <toddmparker_> or you can paste them in from that 'bin. either way
[14:08:38] <toddmparker_> just master
[14:09:22] <uGoMobi> I will put map and video in and then push
[14:09:50] <uGoMobi> I use the map for close button example
[14:09:58] <agcolom> Cool! This is REALLY Exciting!
[14:10:01] <uGoMobi> where do we want the video? just at the bottom
[14:10:04] <uGoMobi> ?
[14:13:57] <agcolom> We could have a section on interactive content in popups?
[14:20:27] <agcolom> I think on the iPad the video example is really sexy! you can even go full screen and back again inside the popup!
[14:21:33] <agcolom> If anyone asks where the map pointer is, it's where my office is in London :-) University of Westminster, Cavendish site (near Oxford circus)
[14:23:39] <agcolom> photos: this one is nice too: http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/4984552916/
[14:24:39] <agcolom> Sorry, there's a copyright on that one!
[14:29:20] <uGoMobi> errr the close button is not on top of the map
[14:29:47] <uGoMobi> remember that issue with Google Maps API z-index css transform and all
[14:31:10] <toddmparker_> maybe at the bottom
[14:31:19] <toddmparker_> you can re-link the map there too uGoMobi
[14:31:38] <toddmparker_> ah
[14:31:48] <toddmparker_> guess the map isn't a close button example then
[14:32:01] <toddmparker_> we'll figure that out at some point
[14:34:25] <uGoMobi> nah, got it already... z-index :)
[14:36:32] <toddmparker_> BOOM
[14:38:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/C8azUA
[14:38:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] z-index for close button to make it work on API's like Google Maps - Jasper de Groot
[14:38:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Popup map with close button example - Jasper de Groot
[14:39:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: agcolom  check the close button example
[14:39:33] <toddmparker_> lemme pull
[14:40:00] <uGoMobi> yeah its not visible on /test yet
[14:41:00] <toddmparker_> map looks sweet
[14:41:07] <uGoMobi> will do the video example with some white padding
[14:41:14] <toddmparker_> can you add a button for that at the bottom
[14:41:19] <toddmparker_> cool
[14:41:31] <uGoMobi> you mean... two map examples?
[14:41:49] <uGoMobi> same example, two links
[14:42:17] <toddmparker_> ya
[14:42:21] <toddmparker_> that's ok
[14:42:22] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:45:30] <agcolom> I'm waiting for test to show the updated version...
[14:47:11] <toddmparker_> it should be updated by now
[14:47:28] <agcolom> The example with padding... I don't see the difference with the other ones
[14:47:41] <agcolom> (FF13)
[14:48:37] <toddmparker_> actually uGoMobi, maybe we should just have the map at the bottom and keep the close button example super basic
[14:48:53] <toddmparker_> since at that stage, we haven't shown how to set a overlay theme and such
[14:49:16] <toddmparker_> you could just have a basic popup for a left and another for a right close button as demos
[14:49:41] <toddmparker_> not as cool, but that way the examples at the bottom are where all the action is
[14:49:50] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/M0Duow
[14:49:50] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Add popup video example to docs. - Jasper de Groot
[14:49:54] <toddmparker_> you can also link up the map example to the intro at the top
[14:50:32] <uGoMobi> ok two other examples for left and right close button
[14:51:21] <uGoMobi> where would you put that in the intro at the top?
[14:51:51] <toddmparker_> 2nd pp
[14:51:53] <toddmparker_> This simple styling makes it easy to add in widgets like a listview to make a menu or photo to make a lightbox that go right up to the edge of the popup.
[14:52:19] <toddmparker_> the video seems to break over the popup at least in chrome
[14:52:22] <toddmparker_> at some sizes
[14:53:00] <toddmparker_> if i make my window as narrow as possible
[14:53:22] <uGoMobi> ah ok, let me see what I can do
[14:53:56] <agcolom> could add a min width?
[14:56:48] <toddmparker_> not sure...seems like the video won't crunch down
[14:56:59] <agcolom> width of the popup should be 497 (video) + 20px padding either side I think...
[14:57:11] <toddmparker_> johnbender and gseguin - i'm going to announce the download builder at the conference
[14:57:14] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[14:57:19] <agcolom> the video is in an iframe of width 497
[14:57:40] <toddmparker_> for the version select here, how is that updated? if we tag 1.1.1, will that show up automaticlaly?
[14:57:47] <toddmparker_> ah agcolom
[14:57:48] <gseguin> ohhh... pressure...
[14:57:53] <toddmparker_> :)
[14:58:07] <gseguin> no it needs to be updated manually
[14:58:20] <toddmparker_> so andrew just tested 1.1.1rc1 on all devices and everything looks good
[14:58:32] <gseguin> need to add the option
[14:58:36] <toddmparker_> ok, johnbender - i think you can tag 1.1.1
[14:58:41] <gseguin> and on the backend I need to create the directory
[14:58:45] <toddmparker_> (rc1)
[14:58:59] <toddmparker_> once this is tagged, mind making those changes gseguin
[14:59:13] <toddmparker_> and doing a quick test download
[15:00:09] <gseguin> not a problem
[15:00:13] <gseguin> let me know
[15:00:41] <toddmparker_> will do
[15:01:01] <toddmparker_> as soon as this is tagged, i think you can work your magic
[15:02:24] <gseguin> johnbender: let me know when you tag it
[15:08:10] <agcolom> ok, I think that's it from me for today...
[15:08:49] <toddmparker_> thanks for your help agcolom
[15:08:57] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone ! toddmparker: have a safe journey tomorrow :-)
[15:09:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good night Anne
[15:09:53] <agcolom> my pleasure :-) Nice to think the demo I was preparing while invigilating an exam will be shown in SF !!!!
[15:10:22] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper!
[15:12:06] <gseguin> later agcolom
[15:14:53] <agcolom> Goodnight gseguin! Party time starting soon on your side!
[15:15:31] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: think we should set a max-width on these popups?
[15:15:44] <toddmparker_> we used 500 for dialogs
[15:15:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: it's a combination of settings
[15:15:56] <toddmparker_> the tooltip gets crazy wide
[15:16:19] <uGoMobi> and some additional docs specific style rules that I have to negate
[15:16:57] <toddmparker_> the docs stuff is a problem
[15:16:58] <uGoMobi> then we set a max-width on the tooltip
[15:17:07] <toddmparker_> looks like i can just add  style="max-width:500px;"
[15:17:12] <toddmparker_> to the popup
[15:17:20] <toddmparker_> so a class or style can be used
[15:17:36] <toddmparker_> just dunno if we want to limit it by default
[15:17:47] <toddmparker_> something to ponder
[15:17:50] <uGoMobi> max-width will work but it's also about the scaling
[15:19:12] <toddmparker_> all the 1.1.1-rc.1 CSS and JS links look great johnbender
[15:20:44] <agcolom> uGoMobi, toddmparker_ Sorry, I'm still here! once dismissed, the video popup cannot be launched again, but that problem is not present in http://jsbin.com/okehir/85/
[15:20:55] <toddmparker_> docs zip is also a go
[15:21:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: cool
[15:21:17] <toddmparker_> agcolom: interesting, we'll take a look
[15:21:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so I can tag and push?
[15:21:21] <toddmparker_> now go to bed!
[15:21:29] <toddmparker_> you can indeed johnbender
[15:21:46] <toddmparker_> everything checks out
[15:22:27] <agcolom> weird only does it with FF (FF13). Going to be now sir! ;-)
[15:23:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: done
[15:26:16] <toddmparker_> AWESOME
[15:26:30] <toddmparker_> gseguin: you can do you magic
[15:27:18] <toddmparker_> i just downloaded a custom build that checked all widgets + forms but no navigation stuff
[15:27:27] <toddmparker_> jquery.mobile.custom.css is empty
[15:29:06] <toddmparker_> but the theme + structure seem to be there
[15:29:24] <toddmparker_> however, jquery.mobile.custom.structure.min.css is empty, even tho the non-min seems ok
[15:32:02] <toddmparker_> gseguin: under "Navigation", there are 2 loader options
[15:34:45] <toddmparker_> oddly, I searched in our codebase for "packaged loading message functionality" and only had one hit so it doesn't seem like duplicated meta data
[15:35:15] <gseguin> toddmparker_: yeah I know about jquery.mobile.custom.css being empty
[15:35:35] <gseguin> I need to not output a file when there is nothing to put in it
[15:36:14] * johnbender suspects that callbacks make that a bit harder :)
[15:36:17] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[15:37:17] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[15:37:18] <gseguin> :)
[15:37:58] <toddmparker_> i gotta head home but will be packing and working on my preso tonight
[15:38:04] <johnbender> cool
[15:38:05] <toddmparker_> i'll try to hop on here and catch up
[15:38:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll be offline until the afternoon tomorrow
[15:38:23] <johnbender> travel
[15:38:26] <toddmparker_> 1.1.1 seems solid. tested, blogged, tagged
[15:38:29] <johnbender> :D
[15:38:32] <johnbender> huzzah
[15:38:40] <toddmparker_> yee
[15:38:54] <toddmparker_> i don't think the new jQM site can go live for thursday
[15:38:58] <toddmparker_> oh well
[15:39:09] <johnbender> doing that at a conference is asking for trouble
[15:39:17] <toddmparker_> i know
[15:39:20] <johnbender> everyone who can deal with issues is busy shmoozing
[15:39:30] <johnbender> life goes on
[15:39:31] <toddmparker_> that's the issue - we all want to release stuff at the conf, but it's notty
[15:39:35] <toddmparker_> heh
[15:39:49] <toddmparker_> that's why i'm happy 1.1.1 is in the bag
[15:39:54] <toddmparker_> and 1.2 is pushed off a bit
[15:40:00] <johnbender> aye, stuff we can control
[15:40:08] <toddmparker_> MauriceG: you around?
[15:47:57] <gseguin> toddmparker_: http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/ is updated
[15:49:46] <toddmparker_> nice gseguin
[15:50:25] <toddmparker_> wonder if we should eventually add 1.0.1 to this
[15:50:59] <toddmparker_> should we nix 1.1.1-pre?
[15:51:11] <gseguin> you tell me
[15:51:28] <toddmparker_> i think so
[15:51:33] <gseguin> or I can rename it to 1.1.2-pre
[15:51:40] <toddmparker_> since it's the same as 1.1.1
[15:51:48] <toddmparker_> yeah, that's better
[15:51:51] <gseguin> right now it is
[15:52:00] <toddmparker_> right, but i like that idea
[15:52:01] <gseguin> but it's pointing at the 1.1-stable branch
[15:52:13] <toddmparker_> yeah. let's just re-name
[15:52:23] <toddmparker_> is an RC a stable release
[15:53:10] <toddmparker_> actually, we can't add 1.0, can we?
[15:53:24] <toddmparker_> it's not set up with the right code is it?
[15:53:38] <gseguin> done
[15:54:03] <toddmparker_> thanks!
[15:54:05] * gseguin checks
[15:55:27] <gseguin> toddmparker_: it is possible to add 1.0.1 but it seems like a lot of work
[15:55:42] <toddmparker_> yeah, that's ok
[15:55:45] <gseguin> we basically need to AMDify everything
[15:55:50] <toddmparker_> this will get people to ease in
[15:55:58] <toddmparker_> no way that's worth it
[15:56:11] <gseguin> so you want me to move the RC into unstable?
[15:56:22] <toddmparker_> i guess so...
[15:56:52] <gseguin> Or maybe its own category
[15:56:54] <toddmparker_> johnbender: you have an opinion on when something is stable
[15:57:03] <gseguin> "Release Candidates"
[15:57:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: when we feel like it's stable
[15:57:18] <johnbender> :D
[15:57:20] <toddmparker_> heh
[15:57:23] <johnbender> no bug reports for an RC
[15:57:26] <johnbender> err
[15:57:31] <johnbender> no _new_ bug reports for an RC
[15:57:41] <toddmparker_> so should 1.1.1rc1 we listed under stable or unstable releases in the builde
[15:57:50] <johnbender> stable
[15:57:54] <toddmparker_> oh, ok
[15:57:56] <johnbender> we think it's an RC
[15:58:01] <toddmparker_> we're set then
[15:58:06] <johnbender> that is we think it's ready for release
[15:58:08] <gseguin> or "release candidates"
[15:58:10] <toddmparker_> i'd really like to not change it at all now
[15:58:11] <johnbender> so ostensibly we think it's stable
[15:58:32] <toddmparker_> just wait and if nothing big comes in by next week, go final
[15:58:36] <toddmparker_> true
[15:58:41] <toddmparker_> ok
[15:58:47] <toddmparker_> alright, heading out
[15:58:56] <toddmparker_> thanks everyone for all the hard work.
[15:59:02] <toddmparker_> nice to have a bow on this one

[18:35:39] <trollboy_> I see in the jquery mobile docs, the dialog stuff links to a physical html page.. is there a way to dynamically generate the content?
[18:36:05] <trollboy_> like can I do a $('#mydialog').html('foo bar');
[19:48:50] <gseguin> johnbender: something's off on the builder
[19:49:03] <gseguin> there should not be a jquery core checkbox

[19:49:23] <gseguin> can we do another spin for RC1?
