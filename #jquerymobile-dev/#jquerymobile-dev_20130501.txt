[06:11:40] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: we had previously talked that you were trying to slim down the ui core a bit and we were going to pull in ui core and remove those at that point
[06:11:40] <b-ot> arschmitz: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[06:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yes, but do you expect to be pulling in UI core soon?
[06:13:38] <scott_gonzalez> If not, you should trim down that list to match UI.
[06:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'd actually like to trim down the UI list even more.
[06:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> But right now the list in Mobile is technically wrong.
[06:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> There are values that will fail in some browsers.
[06:29:33] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: our hope was to be able to do it for 1.4 which is our next release
[06:29:54] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ill fix the current list for 1.3.2 for sure though
[06:30:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: I see the issue with that commit im fixing it right now

[07:55:35] <monk12> just curious, is there a generic mobile development channel on freenode? something different than here or #phonegap where you might ask more generic questions?
[08:00:09] <arschmitz> #jquery is the best place for jquery mobile questions
[08:00:23] <arschmitz> monk12: ^^
[08:23:45] <gseguin> arschmitz: now I am
[08:23:48] <gseguin> what's up?
[08:43:24] <arschmitz> gseguin: i think i found the issue with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5951
[08:43:30] <arschmitz> and the 404's 
[08:43:58] <gseguin> arschmitz: what is it?
[08:43:59] <arschmitz> its part of the build process im just not sure where its being done so i thought you would know
[08:44:18] <arschmitz> on all the other pages we are changing the link address for these files
[08:44:24] <arschmitz> this page is not getting changed
[08:44:41] <arschmitz> the others are all being changed from ../../../ to ../../
[08:45:18] <arschmitz> so of course the unchanged ones do not resolve 
[09:11:43] <gseguin> arschmitz: 
[09:11:48] <gseguin> I'll take a look later

[09:47:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5951 At the moment that demo page doesn't give a 404.
[09:47:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so it appears to be a server issue
[09:52:15] <arschmitz> u
[09:52:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: which link are you checking it wont happen on master because thats not build and does not have a dist folder
[09:52:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i still am getting 404's
[09:52:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/examples/swipe/newyork.html
[09:53:11] <arschmitz> im still getting 404
[09:54:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: Europe doesn't ;)
[09:55:04] <arschmitz> very strange because the links in the head of that file are wrong
[09:56:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that file refrences ../../../css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.css
[09:56:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I see what you mean
[09:56:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it should be ../../css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.min.css
[09:56:58] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:57:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I do see 404's in the console
[09:57:20] <toddmparker> johnbender: are you around?
[09:57:23] <arschmitz> weird i dont see how lol
[09:57:44] <toddmparker> I'm in a client meeting and can't make the jQ tech callâ€¦can you make it so we have an update?
[09:57:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but this morning the whole page didn't load.... I saw the server 404 error page
[09:58:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: now the page load but not all sources
[09:58:28] <arschmitz> yeah the page should load but none of the head files should
[09:58:38] <uGoMobi> right
[09:59:13] <arschmitz> which is a build issue somehow this page is getting passed over and the links are not updated when the rest of the demos pages are
[10:00:21] <arschmitz> because the actual file in master is right
[10:00:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe it has to do with the source files being html (not php)
[10:00:42] <arschmitz> ohhh i bet thats it 
[10:00:51] <arschmitz> i bet in the build it only updates php files
[10:00:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: now I say that... I know this for sure
[10:01:01] <arschmitz> AHA!
[10:01:04] <uGoMobi> yup
[10:01:15] <arschmitz> so easy fix rename them to php 
[10:01:22] <uGoMobi> right
[10:01:43] <arschmitz> want me to take care of it
[10:01:44] <arschmitz> ?>
[10:01:44] <bot-t> ...
[10:02:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good catch on that i looked all through the build files and could not see why this was being excluded lol didnt notice it wasent php
[10:02:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I thought we changed that, maybe we missed those
[10:03:19] <arschmitz> yeah easy to miss. I already have it open ill fix it
[10:03:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when you change the extension can you do a quick check for other html files?
[10:03:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok thanks
[10:03:59] <arschmitz> yup no prob
[10:11:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: WO! 1.3 just completely disappeared from view!
[10:12:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its not even listed on the index anymore!
[10:12:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah same here
[10:12:50] <arschmitz> thats not good!
[10:12:52] <uGoMobi> tags are gone :(
[10:13:23] <arschmitz> im still getting tags through 1.2.0
[10:13:31] <arschmitz> but nothing after that
[10:13:37] <uGoMobi> yeah me too
[10:13:55] <arschmitz> well they are still in github atleast lol
[10:14:23] <arschmitz> gnarf: ping!
[10:15:09] <gnarf> ?
[10:15:33] <gnarf> not sure whats deleting these folders
[10:15:42] <gnarf> but SOMETHING is blowing these up
[10:15:46] <arschmitz> all our recent tags have disappeared from view.jquerymobile.com
[10:15:53] <arschmitz> ok
[10:16:03] <arschmitz> they were there like 5 minutes ago
[10:16:21] <uGoMobi> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/ is still up
[10:16:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: wasent for me a min ago
[10:16:46] <uGoMobi> first time I visited it was plain html, but after refresh homepage is ok
[10:16:56] <arschmitz> yeah they are back on index now
[10:17:04] <arschmitz> its fixed now
[10:17:36] <arschmitz> gnarf: did you fix it?
[10:17:40] <gnarf> nope
[10:17:42] <uGoMobi> for me all links on http://view.jquerymobile.com/ are gone now
[10:17:47] <gnarf> but im re-rerunning the whole thing
[10:17:53] <gnarf> which is why they are gone again
[10:17:58] <arschmitz> ok 
[10:18:18] <arschmitz> well it somehow fixed itself just before you did that very weird
[10:18:21] <gnarf> uGoMobi: p.s. cd /var/www/view.jquerymobile.com ; rm public_html/data.json ; ./cron.sh 
[10:18:30] <gnarf> that should re-generate EVERYTHING
[10:18:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: do you have server access to do that i know i dont?
[10:19:03] <uGoMobi> nope
[10:19:10] <uGoMobi> I think gseguin has
[10:19:18] <arschmitz> i think only gseguin and johnbender do
[10:19:32] <gseguin> what did I do ?
[10:19:36] <arschmitz> nothing
[10:19:38] * gseguin catches up
[10:20:06] <gseguin> ouch view is kinda broken
[10:20:08] <arschmitz> gseguin fixed the issue i talked to you about earlier though
[10:20:20] <arschmitz> yeah gnarf is regenerating right now its intentional
[10:20:59] <gseguin> oh ok
[10:21:26] <arschmitz> gseguin: the issue with the demo i talked to you about was it has an html not php extension so it wasent being updated as part of the build process
[10:21:41] <gseguin> gotcha
[10:21:43] <arschmitz> so im commiting that fix right now just changing to php and it should be fixed
[10:21:58] <arschmitz> checking to make sure nothing else ws skipped in addition though
[10:22:24] <arschmitz> gseguin: so your off the hook :)
[10:22:59] <arschmitz> im heading to get some lunch be back in a while
[10:24:05] <gseguin> :)

[11:13:03] <johnbender> toddmparker: I am now
[11:13:56] <johnbender> toddmparker: sorry, I was in transit to Las Vegas
[11:27:28] <gseguin> johnbender: party time?
[11:27:38] <johnbender> gseguin: speaking at a conference tomorrow
[11:27:51] <johnbender> Future Insights Live!
[11:27:51] <gseguin> oh, that kind of party ;)
[11:27:52] <johnbender> what a name
[11:28:02] <gseguin> speaking ?
[11:51:51] <arschmitz> gnarf: gseguin: all tags are gone off view.jquerymobile.com
[11:53:06] <gnarf> thats just loaded from a json file
[11:53:16] <gseguin> arschmitz: I don't know how that thing works, I know it listens to a webhook to create the tags
[11:53:21] <gnarf> nope
[11:53:23] <gnarf> its cron
[11:53:37] <gseguin> see I don't know anything, that's what I was saying
[11:53:37] <gnarf> source is @ https://github.com/jquery/node-web-git-proxy
[11:53:39] <arschmitz> does the cron wipe out and rebuild all the tags when it runs"?
[11:53:43] <gseguin> don't listen to me
[11:53:44] <gnarf> arschmitz: it shouldn't
[11:53:54] <gnarf> but there might be a bug in the data.json writing 
[11:53:58] <gnarf> feel free to review it
[11:53:59] <gnarf> :)
[11:54:17] <arschmitz> gnarf ill look
[11:55:39] <arschmitz> gnarf: what ever this is im willing to bet its the root of the instability we have been seeing on view
[11:55:45] <gnarf> yup
[11:55:49] <gnarf> i mean, its still buggy
[11:56:04] <gnarf> it might just be that .tags somehow doesn't get written if no tags changed
[11:56:14] <gnarf> so every 5 minutes it loses the tags, then rebuilds every tag 
[11:56:17] <gnarf> which causes buggy
[11:56:28] <arschmitz> sounds reasonable
[11:56:42] <gnarf> or something silly like that
[11:56:53] <gnarf> feel free to do whatever in a pull, it should all be locally testable
[11:57:14] <arschmitz> ok ill take a look and see what i can figure out
[12:07:18] <arschmitz> ./cron.sh
[12:07:24] <arschmitz> oops
[12:07:52] <toddmparker> reading the back scroll hereâ€¦hi all
[12:08:28] <arschmitz> toddmparker: hi working on the view instability right now
[12:08:30] <agcolom> Hi toddmparker !
[12:08:41] <arschmitz> think found the cause so no to fix :)
[12:14:42] <agcolom> toddmparker: ok for this tutorial to go on the resources page? http://miamicoder.com/2013/jquery-mobile-sample-executive-dashboard/
[12:28:55] <arschmitz> agcolom: i like that thats usefull
[12:30:28] <agcolom> yes, thanks. Will add it then :-) nice to see how to use flot graphs library with jQuery Mobile
[12:31:02] <arschmitz> for sure
[12:33:02] <arschmitz> wow never realized how inconsistant view is until iv been using it a LOT today
[12:49:41] <arschmitz> gnarf: ping!
[12:54:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you aroung?
[12:54:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes I am here
[12:55:27] <arschmitz> know why the backbone and redirect demos are using jqm cdn ???
[12:56:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: noticed because they are both .html yet they both work
[12:56:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, not sure
[12:56:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: have about 20 pages that currently are html and dont work that i found !
[12:56:51] <arschmitz> actually more then that
[12:56:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I also looked at the sources of that demo before
[12:57:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: wasn't sure if something would break if we update
[12:57:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's insane
[12:57:49] <arschmitz> only noticeable if you refresh
[12:58:03] <arschmitz> because they are using headfiles off working pages when you navigate to them
[12:58:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if you notice view being weird please let me know ASAP
[12:59:11] <arschmitz> like even email me if im not around i have view setup locally and am trying to reproduce the problem and its looking like its github
[12:59:16] <arschmitz> but i need to reproduce
[13:00:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on the bright side if im right i have a workaround
[13:01:28] <arschmitz> iv counted at least 5 times its been down today but it seems to only last ~5-10 minutes
[13:01:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I remember that we discussed changing the extension from .html to .php but then came up with another fix
[13:02:09] <arschmitz> but of course none since i set view up
[13:02:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure, will let you know when I notice it's down
[13:02:30] <uGoMobi> of course
[13:02:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: another fix for what?
[13:03:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: checking all these demo pages to make sure they need to be changed showed just how buggy view is right now super annoying
[13:03:55] <uGoMobi> it is
[13:04:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: another fix for demos not working
[13:04:17] <arschmitz> oh ok
[13:04:25] <uGoMobi> I just can't remember exactly
[13:04:41] <arschmitz> yeah well im going to update everything to php and fix all the links
[13:05:01] <uGoMobi> great
[13:05:06] <arschmitz> to at least get those fixed then hopfully i can get view straightened out
[13:05:45] <arschmitz> im pretty confident about the fix i have in mind though. just need to reproduce and then talk to gnarf
[13:19:49] <gnarf> arschmitz: here now
[13:23:29] <arschmitz> gnarf: cool so think i found the issue
[13:23:49] <arschmitz> i think occasionally something goes weird with the updae from github
[13:24:16] <arschmitz> if so the shas will be invalid and it deletes any tags with an invalid sha
[13:24:42] <gnarf> hrm
[13:24:50] <gnarf> "something goes weird" -- the fetch?
[13:25:07] <arschmitz> i think so i cant reproduce yet
[13:25:19] <arschmitz> but looking at the script its the only real explination 
[13:25:53] <arschmitz> because if the tag is missing or has a bad sha it gets deleted
[13:28:41] <arschmitz> gnarf: so my question is why delete tags at all shouldnt a tag be "forever"?
[13:29:04] <gnarf> arschmitz: if you delete the tag in github, i figured you'd want to remove it from view
[13:29:26] <arschmitz> gnarf: makes sense but why would we ever delete a tag?
[13:30:03] <arschmitz> for other people maybe but specificly for jquery?
[13:30:25] <gnarf> i'm not sure -- feel free to add more logging or whatever too
[13:30:32] <gnarf> do you have ssh on jq03
[13:30:33] <gnarf> ?
[13:30:36] <arschmitz> no
[13:31:04] <arschmitz> because yeah adding a log would show forsure if im right
[13:40:50] <toddmparker> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/examples/swipe/newyork.html is unstyled for me
[13:41:06] <agcolom> same here
[13:41:36] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i have the fix for that already
[13:41:40] <johnbender> gseguin|away: don't tell anyone but I got a beer on the way back from lunch and I'm drinking it while working on my presentation
[13:41:51] <johnbender> toddmparker: sorry about the meeting this morning
[13:41:56] <arschmitz> but there are about 25 other demos with same problem im fixing
[13:42:02] <johnbender> toddmparker: I should have let you know I was going to be traveling to vegas :(
[13:52:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz:I looked at the IRC log http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquerymobile-dev/%23jquerymobile-dev_20130410.log.html
[13:52:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: huh?
[13:52:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: instead of renaming gseguin|away fixed the issue by doing a second pass
[13:52:56] <toddmparker> arschmitz and gnarf - great. i'm getting a ton of complaints about the site being down
[13:53:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's why we didn't changed .html to .php
[13:53:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm well second pass isnt working then 
[13:53:34] <uGoMobi> uGoMobi	I can rename them and a look for links to those files	08:42
[13:53:34] <uGoMobi> uGoMobi	but would be nice if we can fix the cause	08:43
[13:53:34] <uGoMobi> uGoMobi	seems a more solid solution to me	08:43
[13:53:34] <uGoMobi> gseguin	uGoMobi: OK, so we process html files in secondpass as well	08:44
[13:53:34] <uGoMobi> gseguin	and that should workâ„¢
[13:54:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm ill look for the second pass in the build and see if i can see something up
[13:54:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: or it is fixed in 1.3--stable but not in 1.3.1 build
[13:54:35] <toddmparker> johnbender: no worries about the meeting. I was in my client session and realized I was going to miss it. Buried in client stuff.
[13:54:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill check it out
[13:55:01] <johnbender> toddmparker: get that paper!
[13:55:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok thanks
[13:55:07] <toddmparker> got an offer from the guy who runs glyphish.com - he wants to make a jQuery Mobile icon pack of rus
[13:55:09] <gnarf> toddmparker: 'the site' ?
[13:55:20] <toddmparker> view.*
[13:55:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: oh that's cool
[13:55:26] <toddmparker> gnarf ^
[13:55:47] <gnarf> toddmparker: something wacky happening in there today
[13:55:50] <gnarf> not sure what it is
[13:57:21] <arschmitz> gnarf: the only things i can see that would blow those folders away is if when we fetch its either straight missing those tags or there is a bad sha in them
[13:57:33] <arschmitz> either one will cause the folders / tags to be removed
[13:58:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you talking about same errors we see on Jenkins? http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%201.2-stable/155/
[13:58:42] <gnarf> arschmitz: there is a cron.out on the server 
[13:59:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: could be related i suppose
[13:59:33] <gnarf> arschmitz: send me your ssh pub key?
[13:59:51] <gnarf> let me get you into this machine so you can watch it
[13:59:51] <arschmitz> ok just give me like 10 minutes need to finish something
[13:59:54] <gnarf> because i'm way to busy
[14:00:43] <arschmitz> gnarf: no problem im more then happy to help with anything i can know your generally super busy
[14:09:29] <toddmparker> gnarf: full moon?
[14:12:47] <gnarf> toddmparker: yeah, i dunno, could just be the crazy of being in portland ;)
[14:13:24] <toddmparker> true, true
[14:14:05] <gseguin> so what are you saying?
[14:14:15] <gseguin> that the grunt pass isn't working?
[14:15:40] <gseguin> arschmitz, uGoMobi: ^
[14:15:46] <arschmitz> gseguin: im still looking into it but uGoMobi: said the html files are suposed to be processed in a second pass
[14:15:54] <arschmitz> and it does not look like that is happening
[14:16:03] <gseguin> what branch? master?
[14:16:12] <uGoMobi> gseguin: did that fix land in the 1.3.1 build?
[14:16:33] <gseguin> hmm good question, I don't know
[14:16:36] <gseguin> let me check
[14:16:39] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:21:26] <gseguin> uGoMobi: the answer is no
[14:21:53] <uGoMobi> gseguin: is it in the 1.3-stable branch for 1.3.2?
[14:22:14] <gseguin> yep
[14:22:34] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:22:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ^^^
[14:23:15] <arschmitz> ok so forget all the changes just need to get 1.3.2 out lol
[14:24:43] <arschmitz> ugh wish i had not spent all the time checking and changing all those :(

[17:18:01] <RWhitbeck> Hey guys the demos link on jquerymobile.com is coming up 404 
[18:07:06] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: if you notice that again please try and hunt me down ASAP im working on this issue its an issue on the server but i need to beable to check some things while its actually down
[18:07:41] <RWhitbeck> consider you stalked arschmitz
[18:08:41] <arschmitz> awesome just commented with examples on cookbook issue too
[18:10:06] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: also writing chapter 2 intro right now
[18:10:33] <RWhitbeck> thanks, one day we'll finish that damn thing
[18:10:41] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah
[18:10:45] <arschmitz> its slow going
[18:12:32] <RWhitbeck> The worst is the weekly emails from the publisher looking for sitrep
[18:14:06] <arschmitz> yeah thats stinks it was a good idea just getting people to actually follow through
[18:14:18] <arschmitz> is hard
[18:15:53] <arschmitz> if i get some free time ill try to write a couple recipes just been really busy lately
[18:23:42] <RWhitbeck> you and me bothâ€¦appreciate all the help you can provide. 
[18:24:27] <arschmitz> no problem anytime you have anything specific let me know and i can make some time
[18:25:32] <RWhitbeck> hey got time for a question I keep getting
[18:26:22] <RWhitbeck> why do we use divs for the page template over something like <article><section><header><content><footer>?
[18:26:37] <RWhitbeck> I've been asked that numerous times
[18:27:01] <arschmitz> yeah
[18:27:03] <RWhitbeck> my default answer has been because older devices might not understand those elements. 
[18:27:14] <arschmitz> pretty much
[18:27:24] <arschmitz> we dont use any html 5 elements
[18:27:49] <RWhitbeck> ok as long as I am not outright lying to them :P
[18:28:18] <arschmitz> nope that is the correct answer
[18:28:32] <arschmitz> for the most part the element you use does not matter though
[18:29:15] <arschmitz> if they prefer something else they can use and in "most" situations it should be fine unless we use it for scoping in css or something 
[18:29:27] <arschmitz> but we generally avoide forcing that
[18:31:19] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/755/edit
[18:31:46] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: that uses header footer and content
[18:31:59] <RWhitbeck> the margins are off
[18:32:16] <RWhitbeck> looks like the css isn't picking it up correctly. 
[18:32:33] <arschmitz> yeah looks like content must be scoped to a div 
[18:33:08] <RWhitbeck> oh it looks worse in the edit screen then it does full screen
[18:34:15] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: hmm its not scoped 
[18:34:48] <arschmitz> ahh its because <content> is an inline element not block
[18:34:53] <arschmitz> so it cant get padding
[18:35:05] <arschmitz> if i make it display:block it gets the padding
[18:36:18] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: i wonder if its worth opening an issue for this would be easy enough to force display:block so it would work with content properly
[18:36:46] <RWhitbeck> that would suggest we support this?
[18:37:18] <arschmitz> we more or less do we dont force you to use divs its just how we do the examples
[18:37:30] <arschmitz> nothing says you must use a div
[18:38:09] <arschmitz> the only issue currently is that content is an inline element
[18:38:39] <RWhitbeck> sounds like a great issue to report then
[18:38:39] <arschmitz> it "works" fine its just inline elements cant have padding and ui-content has padding normally
[18:39:09] <arschmitz> yeah ill bring it up in the meeting tomorrow too
[18:39:30] <arschmitz> that we should set up a demo using html5 elements because its a common question
[18:39:47] <arschmitz> its perfect for a demo
[18:46:30] <vick08> Hi devs. Is there anyone who can help with a quick ARIA-related question?
[18:48:14] <vick08> I am trying to apply role=button to jQM back buttons (added through data-add-back-btn). I've looked through the whole stylesheet but can't quite figure out which classes I should be looking for. Once I identify the class, I will go and dynamically add the role via Javascript. Thoughts?
[18:49:29] <arschmitz> vick08: this is really more a question for #jquery but i suggest using firebug or chrome inspector to see the classes that are applied to the wrapper
[18:50:52] <jqcommit> [13api.jquerymobile.com] 15jwatkin opened issue #112: Insignificant typo in JQM Panel API documentation  02http://git.io/AIYjTg
[18:53:04] <vick08> K sorry.
[18:53:36] <arschmitz> not a problem i highly suggest getting familier with with an inspector like that it will help a lot
[19:00:10] <jqcommit> [13api.jquerymobile.com] 15jwatkin opened issue #113: Wrong bug reporting link in the footer of JQM API pages    02http://git.io/G0DvPg
[19:02:13] <vick08> Yeah, long story short, Web Inspector doesn't work well with my screen reader. :)
[19:02:32] <vick08> I'll debug from Javascript itself.
[22:10:52] <pingou> hi
[22:11:27] <pingou> I just wanted to point out that the example on the page http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/widgets/pages/ seems to be broken
[22:11:53] <pingou> a number of link to css/js are returning 404, for example on the multi-page example
