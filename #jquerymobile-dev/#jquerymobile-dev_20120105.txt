[02:37:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] removed z-index rules, as pages no longer overlap in transitions - scottjehl
[02:37:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] removed or moved  opacity rules for simpler cascade - scottjehl

[02:58:31] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] updated the rotate transition to move the page out of view - scottjehl
[03:12:26] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to fade-out-in-transition: http://git.io/LO10Lg
[03:12:26] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] Added a new core option called maxTransitionWidth, which defaults to 1000. Accepts any number or false value. If it's not false, the handler will use a "none" transition when the window width is wider than the specified value. This is useful because transitions get very wonky on wider screens. - scottjehl

[07:18:02] <Wilto> gseguin: Badass.
[07:22:30] <Wilto> I was kinda hoping we could generate ev’rything on the builder page based on an API call, buuut that leaves us without labels.
[08:26:21] <jzaefferer> hey mobile folks, maybe someone got an idea what might be going on here
[08:26:30] <jzaefferer> regular icon, rendered in Chrome: http://bassistance.de/i/8fa865.png
[08:26:44] <jzaefferer> same jQuery Mobile back button, in iOS simulator: http://bassistance.de/i/f0a705.png
[08:27:04] <jzaefferer> maybe Wilto knows something?
[08:27:19] <Wilto> Wilto doesn’t know a hell of a lot.
[08:27:32] <Wilto> …Well, that’s interesting.
[08:27:46] <Wilto> Oh.
[08:28:08] <Wilto> Are you using keywords for the background position? Like, “left top?”
[08:28:23] <johnbender> heading into the office should be back online in less than an hour
[08:30:31] <jzaefferer> Wilto: its a regular <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-back ui-icon-shadow"></span>
[08:30:39] <Wilto> Oh, huh.
[08:30:50] <jzaefferer> jQuery Mobile 1.0
[08:31:19] <Wilto> …That’s odd.
[08:50:20] <jzaefferer> there's no post-1.0 release that I could test yet?
[08:56:24] <gseguin> jzaefferer: you could test with 1.0-stable branch but there is no release post 1.0 yet
[08:56:51] <jzaefferer> just tried to use latest, but that screwed everything up
[08:57:19] <gseguin> yeah I wouldn't recommend latest right now
[09:00:19] <jzaefferer> is 1.0-stable somewhere on code.jquery.com?
[09:00:47] <gseguin> no, it hasn't been released yet
[09:01:17] <gseguin> and I don't think there are nighties for branches
[09:03:06] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[09:03:14] <jzaefferer> time to roll my own
[09:04:12] <jzaefferer> btw. jQuery UI uses 1-8-stable, makes it easier to keep it apart from tags
[09:04:25] <jzaefferer> I think Yehuda suggested that originally
[09:05:23] <gseguin> oh so you're suggesting we rename that branch 1-0-stable ?
[09:07:19] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:07:28] <jzaefferer> just tested that, no difference
[09:07:35] <jzaefferer> at least it doesn't break like master
[09:08:11] <gseguin> yeah master unbuilt you need requirejs (or another AMD loader) to run it
[09:08:40] <gseguin> or just build it by invoking: make js
[09:11:21] <Wilto> Hey gseguin, y’know how I’m a huge pain in the ass?
[09:11:30] <Wilto> Related: I have a question for you!
[09:11:41] <gseguin> another one you mean?
[09:11:42] <gseguin> :D
[09:11:53] <gseguin> shoot
[09:12:28] <Wilto> So, I’m hand-coding the builder form, since we’ve got no way to get labels…
[09:12:57] <Wilto> My question is: could we get labels? Could we cram some meta info in comment(s) at the top of the files?
[09:13:05] <gseguin> you could do a hash linking component names to label and iterate on it
[09:13:09] <Wilto> “No” is a reasonable answer here; I know that can’t be easy.
[09:14:49] <gseguin> It's not easy but not impossible
[09:15:36] <gseguin> let me see what I can come up with
[09:16:04] <Wilto> I mean, feel free to take a stab and come back with “no, this sucks.”
[09:19:14] <gseguin> k
[09:27:16] <Wilto> …Hey uh, is master busted at present?
[09:29:42] <toddmparker_> locally that is
[09:29:56] <toddmparker_> johnbender or gseguin  ^^
[09:42:50] <gseguin> it shouldn't be
[09:43:12] <gseguin> but you need requirejs to run the dev build
[09:45:43] <gseguin> toddmparker_, Wilto: ^
[09:47:45] <gseguin> after you fetch/rebased go to the repo root and do: git submodule update --init
[09:47:52] <toddmparker_> i ran bender's command and it's working
[09:48:09] <toddmparker_> i also just tweeted about AMD and the need to run this
[09:48:21] <gseguin> oh good
[09:48:24] <toddmparker_> if we can avoid the need for this command, that would be preferable
[09:48:43] <toddmparker_> my mac was all messed up with git in lion, took some fixing
[09:50:01] <gseguin> it's either that or we store requirejs and r.js in our repo which is cool too but not as cool as submodules
[09:54:02] <kinblas> I ran bender's command lastnight and it left me with a modification that deleted r.js wasn't sure if I should've commited locally or what, so I trashed my tree.
[09:54:47] <kinblas> trashed, meaning I blew it away and cloned a fresh tree
[09:55:06] <kinblas> toddmparker_: can you test the fix for 2933 for me on the playbook?
[09:55:28] <kinblas> hmmm I guess I can test locally with XOOm
[09:55:31] <toddmparker_> been trying kin, stupid thing won't charge
[09:55:44] <kinblas> eh? charger broken?
[09:55:50] <toddmparker_> was working yesterday but is super picky about charging
[09:56:17] <kinblas> toddmparker_: add to list for Monday's meeting :-)
[09:58:23] <toddmparker_> good news, finally charged enough to turn on
[09:58:59] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so for 2933, is it enough to just get the right orientation?
[09:59:05] <kinblas> I need to try and repro the original bug
[09:59:32] <toddmparker_> ok, i'm in...looking for the link
[10:01:01] <toddmparker_> loading...
[10:01:27] <kinblas> http://goo.gl/WvGyx
[10:01:45] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: gseguin: the big ugly thing I _didn't_ consider with submodules is that, I don't think it will complain when your local version of the submodule is out of date
[10:01:49] <kinblas> that link just tests the code that figures out and dynamically creates the re-mapping
[10:02:30] <kinblas> johnbender: I ran your update command on my tree yesterday and it took a long time and finally left me with a pending delete of r.js
[10:02:38] <Wilto> Nah, I just got a grey index.html.
[10:02:42] <toddmparker_> pb loses wifi all the time
[10:02:50] <Wilto> No “you need to do X” feedback whatsoever.
[10:02:51] <johnbender> kinblas: pending delete?
[10:02:52] <kinblas> johnbender: wasn't sure what to do with it so I re-cloned my tree
[10:03:07] <johnbender> kinblas: ahh the removal of the file itself
[10:03:09] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah it churned for a long time and when it was done I did a git status
[10:03:14] <kinblas> and it had a delete r.js
[10:03:20] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, I got that too kinblas.
[10:03:23] <johnbender> yah I'm thinking we just need to vendor the files
[10:03:37] <johnbender> the forced update thing is a deal breaker
[10:03:40] <kinblas> johnbender: what does that mean? (vendor?)
[10:03:51] <johnbender> kinblas: put the files themselves
[10:03:53] <Wilto> I’M SWITCHING TO SENCHA
[10:03:55] <johnbender> in the tree
[10:04:15] <kinblas> Wilto: heh, hope you like designing in js
[10:04:24] <johnbender> ^
[10:04:26] <Wilto> <body></body> is the future.
[10:04:26] <johnbender> that
[10:04:45] <Wilto> In fact, I’d go one step further. No <body>. Or <html>.
[10:05:01] <johnbender> kinblas: I'll double check with gseguin and then probably remove the submodules
[10:05:22] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin we probably need to remove the submodules
[10:05:22] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[10:05:34] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin ping me when you get back
[10:05:35] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[10:07:34] * gseguin catches up
[10:08:47] <gseguin> johnbender: ping
[10:08:47] <bot-t> (3 mins 25 secs ago) <johnbender> tell gseguin we probably need to remove the submodules
[10:08:47] <bot-t> (3 mins 12 secs ago) <johnbender> tell gseguin ping me when you get back
[10:09:23] <gseguin> yeah looks like it's more trouble than needed even though I really like the concept that we don't host code we don't own in our repo
[10:10:57] <johnbender> gseguin: agreed
[10:11:14] <johnbender> gseguin: it's really good for small teams too where you can tell people to update
[10:11:19] <johnbender> sadly we have hundreds of forks
[10:11:30] <johnbender> I should have taken the time to consider this before pushing so that's my bad
[10:11:57] <gseguin> hey that's fine though, it's in the README and it's master
[10:12:12] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I just verified that my re-mapping changes in jQuery Mobile fixes things on XOOM
[10:12:18] <gseguin> and we're fixing fast
[10:12:28] <Wilto> High five, kinblas.
[10:12:40] <toddmparker_> cool kinblas
[10:12:53] <toddmparker_> man, my PB won't connect to either wifi network
[10:12:58] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so what I'll do is land it and then you can try it out on PB?
[10:13:02] <toddmparker_> dunno if the battery is too low for it?
[10:13:07] <toddmparker_> sure
[10:13:10] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I 'll try a few more devices
[10:13:16] <toddmparker_> if the xoom works, PB should too
[10:13:20] <toddmparker_> broken in identical ways
[10:14:55] <toddmparker_> sorry, been trying to get the PB test going for a full day now..it's so cranky
[10:15:07] <toddmparker_> we have a second PB but the 2.0 update bricked it
[10:15:38] <gseguin> stand-up, brb
[10:19:14] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I tested on my PB, uh wait, I still don't have one
[10:19:29] <toddmparker_> :/
[10:19:35] <toddmparker_> i know, right
[10:19:42] <toddmparker_> aren't they like $99 now?
[10:20:13] <kinblas> heh
[10:20:22] <kinblas> it's a shame, they are nice devices
[10:20:45] <toddmparker_> yeah, they are
[10:21:00] <johnbender> gseguin: kinblas: I'm going to test out what the steps looks like after removing the submodules
[10:21:09] <toddmparker_> it lives on in the fire, tho the BB os is way better
[10:22:04] <johnbender> arg nightmares
[10:29:34] <gseguin> back
[10:30:04] <gseguin> johnbender: what's going on?
[10:30:15] <johnbender> gseguin: the steps to undo it are _brutal_
[10:30:23] <gseguin> oh really?
[10:30:33] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I don't think its that big of a deal
[10:30:43] <gseguin> man! and I thought that submodules were the coolest thing
[10:30:46] <johnbender> but I really should have thought this through
[10:30:54] <johnbender> totally my fault
[10:31:01] <johnbender> they are awesome
[10:31:10] <johnbender> if you will _never_ update the dependency
[10:31:13] <johnbender> or if your team is small
[10:31:43] <johnbender> or in the case where push becomes aware of the commit
[10:31:47] <johnbender> in the submodule
[10:31:51] <johnbender> and complains that you're out of date
[10:32:03] <johnbender> git just doesn't support that I don't believe
[10:35:55] <toddmparker_> anyone seen eddie around here?
[10:41:33] <gseguin> nope
[10:44:04] <johnbender> gseguin: kinblas: alright pushing the vendored js
[10:44:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: can we delete that tweet about the submodules :(
[10:44:19] * johnbender is supremely embarassed :/
[10:44:35] <gseguin> the path in the docs need to be updated
[10:45:38] <johnbender> gseguin: I just used the existing docs so that we can do updates by copying from the repo
[10:45:41] <johnbender> directly
[10:45:42] <johnbender> just a cp command
[10:46:03] <toddmparker_> johnbender: i can delete that if you want
[10:46:11] <gseguin> existing paths you mean?
[10:46:15] <toddmparker_> it's been re-tweeted a few times
[10:46:19] <johnbender> gseguin: yes
[10:46:27] <toddmparker_> i can add a new tweet saying no need
[10:46:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ahh it has the amd thing
[10:46:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I would say don't worry then follow up with a tweet for people who pulled the submodules with a link to ...
[10:47:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/VwQIBQ
[10:47:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] remove requirejs and r.js submodules in favor of vendoring the libraries - John Bender
[10:47:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] vendor r.js and require.js - John Bender
[10:47:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: one sec
[10:48:02] <toddmparker_> so if you did the sub-modules like I did, any change?
[10:48:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes
[10:48:37] <johnbender> the update requires an extra step or two
[10:48:39] <gseguin> toddmparker_: "supports AMD" is a not exactly accurate
[10:48:49] <johnbender> yah we don't define things as modules
[10:49:07] <gseguin> we use AMD for dependency management internally
[10:49:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll give you a gist with the steps
[10:49:49] <toddmparker_> bah
[10:49:57] <toddmparker_> ok, so I'll tweet that
[10:50:18] <gseguin> that means that if people want to pull our tree they can use our AMD modules
[10:50:18] <Wilto> DAMMIT, AJPIANO
[10:50:26] <toddmparker_> so people can now just pull master and it will work like before because we're including  those deps?
[10:50:35] <gseguin> yes
[10:50:39] <toddmparker_> ok
[10:51:16] <rwaldron> hey dudes, does anyone here have a minute they wouldn't mind sparing me for a jquery mobile ui/icon related question?
[10:51:45] <Wilto> Huh. Second icon question today. Fire away, man.
[10:52:13] <gseguin> We can export our built bundle as an AMD module by including jquery.mobile.exports in the include array of the build params
[10:52:39] <rwaldron> Use case: I have an icon with two states, something happens, the icon turns on, something else happens, it turns off.
[10:52:57] <rwaldron> i have custom ui-icon-foo for both stats
[10:53:02] <rwaldron> states*
[10:53:38] <rwaldron> I've been through the docs but I can't find anything that simply says "make this function call, d00d"
[10:53:51] <rwaldron> I apologize if I've missed something dead obvious
[10:55:15] <toddmparker_> so are you switching the icon or some otehr style thing (bg color, btn class, etc.)
[10:55:30] <rwaldron> the icon image
[10:55:42] <toddmparker_> so is that controlled by a class?
[10:56:00] <toddmparker_> if so, i'd just swap the icon class
[10:56:04] <rwaldron> (btw, here's a funny thing... the client didn't give me sprites... all individual images :( )
[10:56:08] <rwaldron> toddmparker_ yep
[10:56:17] <rwaldron> i tried that
[10:56:20] <rwaldron> it works
[10:56:43] <rwaldron> but i was just wondering if there was an "API way"
[10:56:52] <rwaldron> if not, no big deal
[10:56:54] <toddmparker_> i don't think we added anything fancy for that
[10:56:58] <rwaldron> word
[10:57:02] <rwaldron> great
[10:57:05] <rwaldron> thanks guys :D
[10:57:09] <toddmparker_> really buttons just decorate the markup
[10:57:38] <toddmparker_> so it's just old skool class stuff
[10:57:51] <toddmparker_> hey team : meeting in 3 minutes!!!
[10:58:28] <_|Nix|_> I'll try to join you guys ...

[11:00:49] <gseguin> yep trying it out
[11:01:19] <Wilto> Woah, hey, meeting, right.
[11:01:28] <Wilto> I completely remembered that unprompted, I assure you all.
[11:04:27] <garann> i don't see you here, dawg

[11:21:12] <ajpiano> sorry Wilto, gseguin :p
[11:22:35] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #369: STILL FAILING in 9 min 51 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/369/

[11:23:27] <Wilto> gseguin: You make any headway with that meta thing, by the way? I meant to ask.
[11:23:53] <gseguin> nope I haven't
[11:23:54] <gseguin> sorry
[11:24:06] <Wilto> Nah, no worries.
[11:24:26] <Wilto> I’m working on something else for a bit anyway.
[11:25:57] <gseguin> k
[11:40:37] <gseguin> Sorry guys I fat fingered
[11:40:46] <gseguin> and got kicked out of the room
[11:41:23] <gseguin> can't re-enter because I blocked the guy who was displaying a political message
[11:41:42] <gseguin> that's silly, DAMMIT GOOGLE
[11:48:06] <gseguin> toddmparker_: http://vimeo.com/34626016
[11:48:25] <Wilto> Yeah, I was wondering about that.
[11:48:31] <Wilto> The future is weird sometimes, man.

[12:28:23] <toddmparker_> kinblas: you here?
[12:28:34] <toddmparker_> i have the PB and test page open
[12:32:56] <toddmparker_> load @ portrait

[12:33:17] <toddmparker_> same for ready
[12:34:02] <toddmparker_> orientatiochange, resize, resize  (twice?) = 180
[12:34:16] <toddmparker_> do you need any of the dimensions?
[12:34:20] <toddmparker_> kinblas ^^
[12:49:38] <toddmparker_> those match my Tab 10.1 (HC)
[12:50:54] <toddmparker_> ipad is the opposite, right?
[12:51:07] <toddmparker_> i get 0 (portrait), -90 (landscape)
[12:51:25] <toddmparker_> does that help? going to be in a from 4-5 est
[12:58:49] <johnbender> gseguin: I responded to jburke
[12:58:58] <johnbender> but I'm sure there's a lot I missed

[13:23:18] <johnbender> gseguin: please do, I'm so massively ignorant on the topic I don't want to make the project look like a bunch of doofs
[13:24:13] <Wilto> Yeah, stay off my turf, johnbender.
[13:24:31] <Wilto> That’s _my_ schtick.

[14:23:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] enforce test order ... dying a little inside - John Bender
[14:26:34] <Wilto> The commit log just got Real.
[14:29:07] <gseguin> FANTASTIC! looks like the post_receive hook is working
[14:29:35] <gseguin> for the amd-builder.no.de service that is
[14:29:58] <Wilto> Sweet.
[14:30:42] <gseguin> toddmparker_, Wilto: there was no comment on my ICS video
[14:30:46] <gseguin> did you see it?
[14:30:54] <Wilto> Oh, hadn’t checked it out yet.
[14:33:30] <toddmparker_> sorry, jumped right into a meeting gseguin
[14:34:20] <toddmparker_> woah, that is crazy slow to start and in between
[14:34:27] <toddmparker_> wonder what's up with that?
[14:38:56] <gseguin> toddmparker_: it could be my ROM or my device
[14:39:15] <toddmparker_> hack0r
[14:39:29] <toddmparker_> don't care about your non-legit ROMs
[14:39:47] <gseguin> heh
[14:40:07] <toddmparker_> i saw an issue today where touch events were totally different in 2.3.3 on various phones, or the SAME phone/OS but with different ROMs
[14:40:23] <toddmparker_> how can anyone support all that business
[14:41:07] <Wilto> Some people just love compiling tarball kernels or whatever, man.
[14:45:08] <gseguin> I did none of that, just downloaded a zip onto my phone, rebooted and prayed
[14:46:40] <toddmparker_> my cat likes tarballs too
[14:46:51] <toddmparker_> i have a Q
[14:47:03] <Wilto> See, when it comes time to upgrade my iPhone, I just throw it away and stand in line for three days. Easy-peasy.
[14:47:23] <toddmparker_> can you use jQM w/o the navmodel stuff? Just include whatever core is, plus form widgets and use that
[14:47:34] <toddmparker_> should be
[14:47:48] <toddmparker_> ^^ gseguin, johnbender or kinblas?
[14:48:10] <toddmparker_> wilto is working on "what is core" in the download builder
[14:48:49] <Wilto> ♪ What is core? (Baby don’t hurt me. Don’t hurt me. No more.) ♪
[14:48:58] <Wilto> …long day, guys.
[14:49:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #371: STILL FAILING in 9 min 39 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/371/
[14:49:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> john.m.bender: enforce test order ... dying a little inside
[14:49:20] <gseguin> Wilto: that's funny it brought the same tune to me
[14:49:56] <Wilto> We’re all stuck with it now.
[14:50:09] <gseguin> core depends on widgets... which is pretty wrong
[14:50:28] <gseguin> s/widgets/widget/
[14:52:39] * gseguin is looking into what is core
[14:57:49] <gseguin> MacIrssi to the rescue
[14:57:52] <gseguin> core is jquery.mobile.core, jquery.mobile.support, jquery.mobile.event
[14:58:26] <gseguin> kinblas, johnbender, you want to add to that?
[15:14:50] <toddmparker_> irccloud freak out
[15:14:55] <toddmparker_> i'm back
[15:14:58] <gseguin> totally
[15:15:08] <toddmparker_> gseguin - did i miss your answer re:core
[15:15:19] <gseguin> core is jquery.mobile.core, jquery.mobile.support, jquery.mobile.event
[15:15:31] <gseguin> from a quick glance
[15:20:19] <gseguin_> and we're back
[15:22:24] <johnbender> gseguin_: hmm
[15:22:53] <gseguin_> I like how IRCCloud minimizes it: "brief glitch with some dropped connections"
[15:23:07] <gseguin_> however the rest of the time it rocks
[15:23:16] <johnbender> gseguin_: was vmouse a core plugin?
[15:23:22] <johnbender> other than that I can't think of anything
[15:24:28] <gseguin_> vmouse is include by event
[15:24:41] <gseguin_> s/include/included/
[15:24:48] <johnbender> gseguin_: ah
[15:25:14] <gseguin> We lost wilto

[15:33:58] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] Test commit to test post_receive hook - Ghislain Seguin
[15:34:43] <gseguin> test successful
[15:39:59] <gseguin> Wilto: core is jquery.mobile.core, jquery.mobile.support, jquery.mobile.event
[15:40:26] <gseguin> which have their own dependencies but these are the top level
[16:47:15] <Wilto> Scott Jehl, you magnificent bastard: https://gist.github.com/1568180
[16:47:37] <Wilto> Check that out at your leisure, guys.
