[01:52:45] <agcolom> Good morning :-)
[01:53:40] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good morning Anne :-)
[01:53:58] <agcolom> Good morning Jasper :-)
[01:54:07] <agcolom> quick question/advice
[01:54:18] <agcolom> on this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4488
[01:55:17] <agcolom> should we just say that if your script is at the bottom of the page it needs delegate? (do you know why)?
[01:55:37] <agcolom> It's nice when we can explain things, but that's not my area!!!
[01:56:42] <agcolom> so I guess if the script is in the head it's all fine?
[01:57:26] * uGoMobi is looking
[01:58:22] <agcolom> no problem ;-) Thanks a lot.
[02:00:54] <uGoMobi> i don't think it will work for sure when placed in the head
[02:01:09] <agcolom> ok, so we always need to use delegate?
[02:01:33] <uGoMobi> yeah or .on()
[02:01:49] <agcolom> ok.
[02:02:03] <agcolom> on is for jQuery 1.7.1?
[02:02:11] <uGoMobi> yes correct
[02:02:16] <agcolom> and delegate?
[02:02:26] <uGoMobi> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:03:30] <agcolom> perfect ;-) so delegate prior to 1.7.1 and on from 1.7.1
[02:03:42] <uGoMobi> yes
[02:04:44] <uGoMobi> although where live() is deprecated and replaced by on(), delegate() still works as far as i know
[02:04:56] <uGoMobi> but lets not make it more complicated than it is ;-)
[02:05:21] <uGoMobi> about that issue...
[02:06:26] <agcolom> should I just say: You will need to use ..(delegate or on).. to ensure that the page is loaded in the DOM prior to running a function on form submit. For example: (and use the provided example there)?
[02:06:59] <uGoMobi> i think it depends on how you construct your site (multi-page template yes/no, ajax nav yes/no) if it's needed, but when you bind to an event like pageshow it will always work
[02:08:00] <uGoMobi> where are you going to put that info? because this is not only about the submit() function
[02:09:04] <uGoMobi> it is a general thing related to how JQM loads "pages"
[02:09:04] <agcolom> as Todd suggested... scripting pages and submitting forms?
[02:09:44] <uGoMobi> so scripting pages would cover the general part, and submitting forms the more specific use case
[02:10:26] <agcolom> for example yes
[02:11:07] <uGoMobi> i am thinking about what is the best way to describe this
[02:11:17] <agcolom> Maybe "to always ensure that the page is fully loaded in the DOM, we recommend that you use delegate ...."
[02:11:41] <agcolom> but if you have a suggestion, that would be wonderful! You seem to have a very good handle on these things ;-)
[02:12:43] <uGoMobi> its more like... to make sure your script gets executed...
[02:13:01] <agcolom> ok....
[02:14:50] <uGoMobi> point is that on a non JQM site the html page with the script on it gets loaded and the script will be excuted (is "executed" right way to say it?)
[02:15:05] <uGoMobi> but with JQM we pull in the content
[02:15:14] <uGoMobi> and the script
[02:15:15] <agcolom> I'm happy for you to do this one if you like, if you have time... or if you have a good description, I can put it in for you and say it's from you in the comment... I don't think I'm the best person to write this one!
[02:15:26] <agcolom> executed is correct.
[02:15:34] <agcolom> script gets executed
[02:16:38] <uGoMobi> ok i can have a look at it but to be honest i would want it to be double checked by our west coast boys as well
[02:17:17] <agcolom> Sounds like  a good plan to me! Thanks a lot.
[02:17:54] <agcolom> I think we may have to wait monday evening for West Coast boys, but that's fine by me.
[02:18:52] <uGoMobi> yeah i guess so
[02:19:01] <agcolom> ok, time to get ready for my daughter's swimming class.... have a great weekend :-)
[02:19:10] <uGoMobi> thanks, you too!
[02:19:32] <agcolom> In the mean time, I'm happy to review a paragraph about it when you're ready, if you like.
[02:20:58] <uGoMobi> i m not sure when i get to do it, but if i have something to read i'll email you

[07:18:07] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: are you here?
[07:18:20] <MauriceG> aehem ... Yes ...
[07:18:24] <uGoMobi> haha
[07:18:27] <uGoMobi> hi!
[07:18:31] <MauriceG> Hi!
[07:18:55] <uGoMobi> i see that PR to revert that part that shouldn't be included
[07:19:18] <uGoMobi> no worries, good you noticed
[07:19:22] <MauriceG> I saw this accicent yesterday and was thinking a while how to say it ...
[07:19:46] <uGoMobi> haha... hope you still got some sleep last night then ;-)
[07:20:32] <uGoMobi> all i wanted to say... i am not going to fix it by pulling your PR but going to make commit myself
[07:20:52] <uGoMobi> reason is that when i pull you PR it are actually two new commits
[07:20:58] <MauriceG> so I wait until you close #4228, then create the revert PR and leave the house ...
[07:21:05] <uGoMobi> thats going to be a bit to messy
[07:21:25] <uGoMobi> haha... no, you dont have to do anything
[07:21:29] <uGoMobi> i close you PR
[07:21:42] <uGoMobi> make the change with one commit with a comment
[07:21:51] <uGoMobi> and then we are fine
[07:22:23] <MauriceG> okay. So I leave no tracks there ... Thanks!
[07:22:52] <uGoMobi> well... almost no tracks ;-)
[07:23:11] <uGoMobi> will have to refer to the PR to explain the commit
[07:23:49] <uGoMobi> and remember that this IRC chat is logged and open to the public on internet :-)
[07:24:10] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:24:46] <MauriceG> But I just want to say, that you pulled it in  ;-)
[07:25:17] <uGoMobi> that's true
[07:25:57] <uGoMobi> so i'll clean up too :-)
[07:26:40] <MauriceG> It was two month old and I was sure, that the updatepagePadding is not inside.  Until yesterday evening when sweden lost against England ...
[07:27:51] <uGoMobi> i am really trying hard now to see any relationship between updatePagePadding and England - Sweden ;-)
[07:29:43] <MauriceG> When Sweden shots the 2:2 I took my iPad not to see it ...
[07:30:21] <uGoMobi> haha ok

[09:21:34] <agcolom> sure. Do we have to cherry-pick readme?
[09:22:01] <agcolom> uGoMobi ^
[09:22:02] <uGoMobi> no don't think so
[09:22:07] <uGoMobi> i didn't

[09:22:46] <agcolom> That's what I thought to... My only merge so far is for the readme...

[09:24:10] <agcolom> ok, one of mine?
[09:24:15] <uGoMobi> no no
[09:24:36] <uGoMobi> it's a commit from scottjehl for transitions
[09:25:11] <agcolom> ok. If it's not a bug fix then it may be normal that it was not cherry-picked
[09:25:21] <uGoMobi> only reason i asked you to not pick into 1.1 is because i think i am going to revert last commits
[09:25:29] <agcolom> ok...
[09:25:46] <agcolom> I'll go and do the api docs ;-)
[09:26:08] <uGoMobi> ok thanks, will let you know when i am done solving this

[10:15:58] <agcolom> thank you :-)
[10:21:03] <Wilto> Man, you guys are unstoppable lately.
[10:22:41] <agcolom> hey, the weather is rubish!
[10:23:36] <agcolom> wilto, I managed to identify how we lose the JQM logo in latest :-)
[10:23:50] <agcolom> no idea why that happens though...
[10:24:09] <Wilto> Oh yeah, I saw that… What’s the deal?
[10:24:31] <agcolom> ok, go to http://jquerymobile.com/
[10:24:54] <agcolom> click any link by doing open link in new tab or open link in new window
[10:25:02] <agcolom> then press the home button.
[10:25:09] <agcolom> The logo is gone!
[10:25:27] <agcolom> sorry go to http://jquerymobile.com/test/
[10:26:09] <uGoMobi> agcolom: i had a look at that too since it happens with all images in the docs
[10:26:23] <uGoMobi> it might have to with misconfigured Etags
[10:26:51] <uGoMobi> at least, that is what i get a warning about when analyze with Pagespeed
[10:26:52] <agcolom> doesn't seem to happen with http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/
[10:27:06] <uGoMobi> ok, didn't try that
[10:27:10] <Wilto> Iiiinteresting.
[10:27:15] <uGoMobi> hey Wilto
[10:27:25] <Wilto> Whassup, uGoMobi?
[10:27:35] <uGoMobi> somebody wants use to look into issue with href
[10:27:38] <uGoMobi> on iPad
[10:27:46] <uGoMobi> and all i see is a Flash page
[10:27:49] <uGoMobi> haha
[10:27:58] <agcolom> my ipad is next to me... go ahead
[10:28:04] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4533
[10:28:05] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4533 on jquery-mobile (firedev; 3h, 34m ago): Links that start with ? (question mark) are not parsed correctly sometimes.
[10:28:16] <uGoMobi> link is in last comment
[10:28:38] <agcolom> ok...
[10:28:57] <uGoMobi> does Flash work on iPad nowadays? need plugin or something?
[10:29:52] <agcolom> Flash working on iPad... not that I know of...
[10:30:46] <uGoMobi> neither do I, so that's why I was surprised when he said to open that example on iPad
[10:33:31] <agcolom> well I'm not sure there's any flash in what I see but the address thing is as he describes. But I guess if he uses rel=external that should fix it?
[10:34:22] <agcolom> The address bar thing does not prevent the page from being displayed correctly... We get that with the docs too...
[10:34:40] <agcolom> or we used to...
[10:34:40] <uGoMobi> oh wait, i guess he uses a browser detection
[10:34:49] <agcolom> yes, must do..
[10:34:49] <uGoMobi> i can't see what you see
[10:35:56] <agcolom> the ipad version is different
[10:36:29] <uGoMobi> yes
[10:37:24] <uGoMobi> yes rel external would fix it if it is an issue with JQM's Ajax nav
[10:38:23] <agcolom> I wonder which version of JQM he is using also
[10:38:58] <uGoMobi> so it's only the url that doesn't display correctly?
[10:39:15] <uGoMobi> you get directed to the right page?
[10:39:20] <agcolom> yes, for me all displays correctly, except the URL
[10:39:21] <agcolom> yes
[10:39:54] <agcolom> you want me to comment on it?
[10:40:07] <uGoMobi> yes please, thank you
[10:40:13] <agcolom> ok.
[10:43:55] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Nope, no Flash on iThings.
[10:44:21] <MauriceG> Hi agcolom, Hi Wilto!
[10:44:28] <Wilto> Hey, MauriceG!
[10:44:33] <agcolom> Hi Maurice :-)
[10:44:47] <agcolom> I'll do your PRs soon ;-)
[10:44:54] <uGoMobi> Wilto: yeah... turned out that tes site had a redirect... only flash for desktop
[10:44:58] <Wilto> Oof, yeah, we shouldn’t have to fish through all this Flash mess to find the issue.
[10:45:17] <Wilto> In cases like this, let’s definitely flag the issue as “in review” and kick it back to them to put together a reduced test case.
[10:46:39] <MauriceG> uGoMobi, no flash on iOS since this is a technology without future (apple ...)
[10:47:49] <agcolom> uGoMobi use Safari and change the useragent to iPad 4.3.3
[10:47:57] <agcolom> you'll see the iPad version
[10:48:09] <uGoMobi> hehe cool
[10:48:12] <Wilto> 1) Makes our lives a lot easier, 2) issues have a way of sorting themselves out when reduced, and 3) I like having the opportunity to teach folks how to better file issues against open source thingies.
[10:48:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom thanks going to try that
[10:48:25] <MauriceG> agcolom: there's no rush for the PRs. Just uGoMobi don't like the issue counter state :-)
[10:48:49] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:48:54] <uGoMobi> thats kinda true
[10:51:45] <agcolom> He's using a local version of JQM, so not sure which version he's using...
[10:52:22] <uGoMobi> he described it as cutting edge so I guess latest
[10:53:01] <agcolom> his site is very nice...
[10:53:03] <uGoMobi> but a bit more clarity couldnt harm
[10:53:06] <uGoMobi> :-)
[10:53:18] <agcolom> oh yes!
[10:53:34] <uGoMobi> i have to admit that Flash site didn't look bad at all either
[10:54:01] <Wilto> What happened to “in review!” I have been gone for too long, you guys.
[10:54:07] <agcolom> changing h
[10:54:14] <agcolom> oops...
[10:54:17] <Wilto> I just commented asking for a test case of some sort, if possible.
[10:54:49] <Wilto> Oh, I’ll make sure he’s using /latest, as well.
[10:55:35] <uGoMobi> in review is still there Wilto... it just had a little makeover and turned blue
[10:55:39] <agcolom> Wilto, yes in review still exists... it's a cold color (from uGoMobi) for cold issues... i.e. no activity for a while and we're wondering whether it's still an issue
[10:55:50] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:56:06] <agcolom> if you're not sure whether it is an issue, it's 0 pending or unconfirmed
[10:56:21] <agcolom> there's also a tag for needs a test case I think...
[10:56:23] <uGoMobi> Cold Case Team is currently hiring Wilto, interested? ;-)
[10:56:48] <uGoMobi> agcolom: actually i dont think there is but that is a good idea
[10:56:57] <uGoMobi> there is one for needs unit test
[10:57:31] <uGoMobi> but that applies more to PR's which you cant label :|
[10:57:40] <agcolom> I get it!
[10:57:41] <Wilto> Hah! I like it.
[10:58:08] <agcolom> So we could add a label for needs a test page
[10:58:13] <agcolom> ?
[10:58:23] <Wilto> Oh, good idea. “Pending test case.”
[10:58:32] <agcolom> Perfect!
[10:59:23] <agcolom> Wilto: Also jonhbender has written a new Readme with lots of info and anchors that apply to PRs, Issues, etc... which you can use in your comments
[10:59:52] <Wilto> Man, what I wouldn’t give for GitHub to add issue templates…
[11:01:17] <agcolom> so see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4533#issuecomment-6373469
[11:01:18] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4533 on jquery-mobile (firedev; 4h, 7m ago): Links that start with ? (question mark) are not parsed correctly sometimes.
[11:01:35] <Wilto> Niiice.
[11:02:50] <agcolom> Wilto, any of you guys coming to London on Wednesday? (Boston Globe is shortlisted for an award!)... it's invite only :-(
[11:02:57] <uGoMobi> lucky bastard... got 3 people looking into his issue within a couple of hours on a saturday ;-)
[11:03:23] <Wilto> agcolom: Oh, no way—what are they up for?
[11:03:31] <Wilto> agcolom: Also, I wish I were.
[11:04:01] <agcolom> checking....
[11:04:24] <MauriceG> Wilto: I would like to come back to an offer you made somtime ago about IRCCloud inviding mails you had.
[11:04:31] <MauriceG> Still an offer?
[11:04:54] <agcolom> http://www.ubelly.com/2012/04/the-critters-2012-shortlist/
[11:05:33] <agcolom> wilto I tweeted it to you, toddparker and scottjehl on 11th June...
[11:06:34] <agcolom> The award name is "Web We Would Mate With"
[11:06:38] <Wilto> Oh, yeah!
[11:07:19] <Wilto> MauriceG: Just got a fresh batch, in fact. Email?
[11:07:47] <Wilto> Man, the Globe is cleanin’ up lately. I take no credit; I just did my best to keep up with Scott and Ethan.
[11:08:13] <MauriceG> Cool !!   magoo at maugo.de   Thanks a lot man !
[11:09:25] <agcolom> So I guess they may send someone internal then?? Shame!
[11:09:54] <Wilto> Sent.
[11:10:19] <Wilto> Ah-hah, that explains where one of the Globe dudes is going…
[11:10:34] <agcolom> They didn't tell you??
[11:10:44] <uGoMobi> ok, time to get some dinner
[11:10:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you create the "needs test page" label?
[11:11:12] <Wilto> I’ve been quietly setting up play-dates between the Globe folks and some people interested in working out responsive advertisements, and one of them is gonna be off the grid next week.
[11:11:13] <uGoMobi> then you can pick the color!
[11:11:14] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:11:15] <MauriceG> I've got it.  Very nice man, thanks a lot!
[11:11:26] <Wilto> Anyone else want an IRCCloud invite, while I’m in the neighborhood?
[11:11:27] <MauriceG> Wilto: ^^^
[11:11:54] <uGoMobi> Wilto: yes i m interested
[11:11:58] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[11:12:03] <uGoMobi> jasper @ ugomobi.com
[11:12:06] <agcolom> ok... Will try... "Pending test case"...
[11:12:27] <Wilto> Headed your way, uGoMobi.
[11:12:33] <uGoMobi> thanks again!
[11:13:08] <Wilto> Anytime.
[11:13:56] <agcolom> uGoMobi how do I create a new label?
[11:14:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom "sample test case page required immediately"  does that fit? ;-)
[11:14:17] <Wilto> “Test case or it didn’t happen.”
[11:14:18] <uGoMobi> see under list of label "create new label"
[11:14:34] <uGoMobi> type the name
[11:14:42] <uGoMobi> PICK NICE COLOR
[11:14:58] <uGoMobi> and click "create label"
[11:15:54] <Wilto> The third step is the most important.
[11:15:58] <uGoMobi> we should also add a label "LAST CHANCE"
[11:16:59] <agcolom> Where is the list of labels? (I can only see it when I go to an issue... but there, there isn't that option)
[11:17:21] <agcolom> got it now! Sorry
[11:17:47] <uGoMobi> i was wrong too... the input field says "new label name"
[11:18:04] <uGoMobi> i m going to delete needs unit test case
[11:18:08] <agcolom> It's hot pink!
[11:18:15] <uGoMobi> cause we dont use it and its only confusing
[11:18:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: why am i not surprised? ;-)
[11:18:30] <uGoMobi> how is your Twingo?
[11:18:47] <agcolom> It's very good :-) 17 years old this month!
[11:18:51] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: please tell me, if you get IRCClound up somehow. Seems it don't like me.
[11:19:10] <agcolom> MauriceG: https://irccloud.com/#!/irc.freenode.net:6667/%23jquerymobile-dev
[11:19:58] <uGoMobi> i like the new label, even the color :-)
[11:20:08] <agcolom> Excellent :-)
[11:20:13] <uGoMobi> but now i m really going to manage some food here
[11:20:41] <MauriceG> ah, wait ... Second time more luck!
[11:20:41] <uGoMobi> MauriceG no problem but i think Anne already got you on the right track there
[11:20:46] <uGoMobi> see
[11:20:54] <agcolom> Yes, time to do that here too... see you guys later...
[11:21:00] <uGoMobi> later
[11:21:53] <Wilto> I’m off to write some polyfills for things that don’t exist, myself. Catch up with you guys soon.
[11:23:30] <MauriceG> I've got an error while setting up the account ...  But now it's fine. I'm online via UMTS, somtimes this make some problems
[11:46:55] <MauriceG> Are we back ?  ;-)
[11:47:35] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: I hope nobody saw us  :-)

[11:48:36] <MauriceG> I've got an uGoMobi frame ...
[11:49:03] <uGoMobi> better get rid of that
[11:49:19] <uGoMobi> doesnt sound like something you should want
[11:50:47] <MauriceG> I just clicked your name and send message. I thought it just prefix your name to the message...
