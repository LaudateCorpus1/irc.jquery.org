[08:46:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3503 from forresst/master - Ghislain Seguin
[09:06:03] <gseguin> toddmparker_: the problem that you raised on Friday with /test is fixed
[09:06:54] <gseguin> though there is still an issue where a cron job is refreshing the workspace and causing the dev mode to be re-enable every once in a while
[09:07:08] <toddmparker_> what does dev mode do?
[09:07:18] <toddmparker_> figured it was fixed since we're developing htat
[09:07:35] <gseguin> it's the mode where you download micro-modules
[09:08:35] <gseguin> It should be pretty simple to work around that problem, I think Bender was going to take a look at that today
[09:10:53] <gseguin> but it should not be out of date anymore, just sometimes you end up in dev mode
[09:33:19] <toddmparker_> hmmm...ok
[09:33:28] <toddmparker_> things get very wonky
[09:34:04] <gseguin> for instance right now /test is working just fine with the built bundle
[09:34:16] <gseguin> so it's super quick to load
[09:39:19] <gseguin> 'morning johnbender
[09:40:11] <johnbender> gseguin: hey
[09:40:17] <toddmparker_> morning guys
[09:40:31] <toddmparker_> gseguin: test does seem to be a lot better, thanks
[09:40:35] <gseguin> johnbender: hey I don't know what's on your plate today
[09:40:43] <gseguin> but there is still a problem with /test
[09:40:47] <toddmparker_> the random navigation ju,ps were spooking me out
[09:40:58] <toddmparker_> jumps
[09:41:05] <johnbender> gseguin: I was planning to move the build over to jenkins today
[09:41:13] <gseguin> a cron job is doing a force checkout causing /test to switch to dev mode
[09:41:27] <gseguin> ok, that should take care of that, right?
[09:41:32] <johnbender> gseguin: instead of the post commit hook?
[09:41:49] <johnbender> gseguin: well yah but I have to turn off the other stuff affecting test so that would be annoying
[09:42:06] <johnbender> gseguin: which cron?
[09:42:14] <gseguin> don't know which one
[09:42:22] <gseguin> but it's consistent
[09:42:49] <johnbender> let me take a look
[09:43:01] <gseguin> if the repo is left alone for a few hours (or accross date change) /test will revert to dev mode
[09:43:13] <gseguin> the only explaination for that is a force checkout
[09:43:44] <gseguin> toddmparker_: what random nav jumps ?
[09:43:58] <johnbender> gseguin: the one's you fixed this weekend
[09:44:13] <toddmparker_> before, when i went to the transitions page, i'd open a dialog and it would self close
[09:44:30] <toddmparker_> or nav me to a random page in the teh history stack
[09:44:32] <johnbender> gseguin: it might be the nightlies build
[09:44:42] <johnbender> gseguin: which I'll have to move over to jenkins too
[09:44:55] <gseguin> toddmparker_: is it still happening right now?
[09:45:03] <gseguin> johnbender: ok
[09:45:05] <toddmparker_> no, doesn't seem to be
[09:45:11] <toddmparker_> but it was on friday
[09:45:19] <toddmparker_> and others saw that in the tracker
[09:45:29] <toddmparker_> you guys fixed something on that?
[09:45:31] <gseguin> toddmparker_: yeah I worked on it on Friday night, it should be fixed now
[09:45:43] <toddmparker_> ok...what was it?

[09:47:27] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (2d, 10h ago): Fixed meta-module for docsMoved dependency on jquery.mobile from jqm-docs to jquery.mobile.docsUse order! plugin to ensure that jquery.mobile gets executed (dumped) firstAdded pragmas around the jqm-docs define
[09:48:06] <gseguin> docs/_assets/js/jqm-docs.js had a dep on "jquery.mobile" so it was loading jquery.mobile twice
[10:45:06] <toddmparker_> gotcha
[11:38:18] <johnbender> gseguin: alright here's my intermediate step
[11:38:29] <johnbender> just letting you know since you're the only other guy with the keys
[11:38:30] * gseguin listens
[11:38:42] <johnbender> I separated the build and the deploy
[11:38:46] <johnbender> into two targets
[11:38:53] <johnbender> and the old latest just dependso on them both
[11:39:03] <johnbender> so we'll have build_latest
[11:39:06] <johnbender> and deploy_latest
[11:39:19] <johnbender> Jenkins will build_latest
[11:39:29] <johnbender> and the /test/ will point at the docs output in the jenkins workspace
[11:39:33] <johnbender> (symlink)
[11:40:04] <johnbender> I have to tell apache to do the deploy to the cdn
[11:40:12] <johnbender> since I don't want to give jenkins access to the cdn
[11:40:15] <johnbender> via keys
[11:40:22] <johnbender> that part needs to be fixed
[11:40:25] <johnbender> but it'll work for now
[11:40:39] <gseguin> ok
[11:41:04] <johnbender> so all those things will run as a jenkins build and we can stop worrying about monitoring and queuing
[11:41:05] <gseguin> one thing, I don't have access to Jenkins
[11:41:13] <johnbender> gseguin: kk, we can fix that easy
[11:41:23] <johnbender> once I get this setup and running I'll take care of that
[11:41:23] <gseguin> I mean no write access
[11:43:02] <toddmparker_> looks like you're cranking johnbender
[11:44:49] <toddmparker_> gseguin: when you're on jQM this week, would you be able to look more into the ICS delay during transitions? seem related to the hashchange stuff...can take many seconds to fire so we stall starting or in between transitions

[11:44:53] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3217 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1m, 3w ago): Page transition re-think: Smoother, faster
[11:45:05] <toddmparker_> since you're the only one with a phone
[11:45:22] <johnbender> gseguin: that's what you get for being a ROM herder
[11:45:30] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ok, will get on it on Wed
[11:45:40] <gseguin> johnbender: heh :)
[11:45:44] <toddmparker_> heh. exactly.
[11:45:58] <toddmparker_> i was looking at the sencha video you posted too
[11:46:19] <toddmparker_> is it true that your bootleg rom looked smooth and the Galaxy Nexus looked so blinky? SO odd.
[11:46:35] <gseguin> yep
[11:46:47] <gseguin> note that I run 4.0.3
[11:46:58] <gseguin> and the galaxy nexus runs 4.0.2

[11:49:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] split up latest build and deploy - John Bender
[11:54:01] <johnbender> gseguin: jenkins changing my life right now
[11:54:18] <gseguin> in better I hope
[11:54:22] <johnbender> yes
[11:54:28] <gseguin> good
[11:54:30] <johnbender> the output is easily readable
[11:54:35] <johnbender> divided by build runs
[11:54:37] <johnbender> so good
[11:54:40] <johnbender> so very good
[11:59:33] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:59:47] <toddmparker_> is this the stuff jzaefferer was working with you on?
[12:00:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: nope, still have to figure that out
[12:00:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: this is our long term solution to the latest build problems
[12:00:21] <toddmparker_> johnbender: not for right this sec, but this is the pull from _|Nix|_ that you should look over - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3504
[12:00:22] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (10h, 49m ago): Disable
[12:00:27] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[12:00:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ah yes, thanks
[12:04:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: not sure if you saw it but I sent over that list of setAttribute stuff from sergey's diff
[12:04:43] <toddmparker_> i saw that, thanks
[12:05:07] <toddmparker_> do i need to do anything on that or is it just some tips for sergey?
[12:05:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that's the list for the ie7 folks to pick over
[12:05:45] <toddmparker_> ah, right. that list.
[12:05:51] <toddmparker_> wonder if we'll ever hear back
[12:14:49] <jzaefferer> ooh, a highlight
[12:37:18] <toddmparker_> highlight?
[13:12:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: he means that he was addressed in chat so his name lights up
[13:12:28] <toddmparker_> ah
[13:20:01] <johnbender> gseguin: another quick note, I'm going to stop removing the previously built files for the latest build
[13:20:19] <johnbender> it doesn't appear to cause any issues and it means we won't have a gap in output while the build runs
[13:20:35] <gseguin> sounds good

[13:56:06] <jzaefferer> toddmparker_: was there any progress in reproducing the Android transition issue?
[13:56:35] <toddmparker_> the ICS slowdown?
[13:56:43] <jzaefferer> or building up a simple testpage that just uses CSS transitions, to compare it to transforms?
[13:56:44] <jzaefferer> yea
[14:23:25] <johnbender> danheberden: I'm going to need to turn off the post commit hook for latest on the jqm repo
[14:23:34] <johnbender> danheberden: at some point this afternoon
[14:36:09] <johnbender> danheberden: also jenkins is eating the world again
[14:36:55] <johnbender> jzaefferer: jenkins appears to be hot and bothered again
[14:37:15] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I'm happy to restart him, is there anyone else I should check with?
[14:39:43] <jzaefferer> johnbender: restarting is fine, but at some point we need to investigate the cause of those runs
[14:40:16] <jzaefferer> a dump that we can stick into visualvm or something like that
[14:46:21] <johnbender> jzaefferer: agreed
[14:47:11] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I think a some monitoring would be good at some point too
[14:47:51] <jzaefferer> johnbender: yeah, but that's a general infrastructure task. It won't tell us why its crashing, just when...
[14:48:58] <johnbender> jzaefferer: clearly
[14:49:24] <jzaefferer> its been a while since I dabbled with heapdumps and stuff. Can you look into that?
[14:49:35] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I don't have enough backround with the jvm ... lol was just going to ask you
[14:49:44] <jzaefferer> Otherwise I can ask around a bit, I'm currently doing some consulting for a Java shop
[14:49:48] <jzaefferer> k
[14:50:16] <jzaefferer> they're running a Grails cluster or something, maybe I can sweettalk their unix hacker into checking on our infra a bit ;)
[15:19:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: alright I think we're in business
[15:19:36] <johnbender> I have to watch the nightlies
[15:19:51] <johnbender> and I need to turn of the post commit hook from github
[15:24:03] <toddmparker_> yeah johnbender?
[15:24:08] <toddmparker_> great
[15:24:30] <toddmparker_> jzaefferer: gseguin is going to look at the ICS slowdown on wednesday when he's "on"
[15:24:51] <toddmparker_> unless you want to jump in...

[15:42:25] <johnbender> gseguin: and test just points at compiled/demos/
[15:42:33] <johnbender> in the jenkins workspace (copy of the repo)
[15:42:40] <johnbender> error emails are  going to the same distro list
[15:42:52] <johnbender> the push to the cdn is still part of the post commit hook
[15:43:09] <johnbender> ewhich I need to disable and add a curl to the build
