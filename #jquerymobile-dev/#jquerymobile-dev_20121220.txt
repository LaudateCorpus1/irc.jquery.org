[00:42:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong!
[00:47:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I found it in the meantime.
[00:47:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Needded the widget review flag.
[00:48:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good morning
[00:48:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[00:48:21] <_|Nix|_> Good morning!
[00:48:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sounds like a boatload of work for 1.4.0 ...
[00:48:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, rewrite the library ;)
[00:49:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pretty close ...
[00:49:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: When we're done, we should do a git diff --stat 1.3.0 and see if we have indeed re-written it.
[00:49:46] <uGoMobi> lol yeah
[00:49:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then we should debate whether we wanna call it 2.0 ...

[05:04:23] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[05:04:56] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:05:10] <arschmitz> so you broke the range slider huh lol ?
[05:08:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:08:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Morning
[05:09:03] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:09:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: saw your new widget review ticket that was one i was already planning on but good to have a ticket so we dont forget lol
[05:09:11] <uGoMobi> nahhh i would ever do that
[05:09:22] <uGoMobi> never*
[05:09:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:lol im sure you will fix it ha ha
[05:12:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. Recreating web-ui-fw from scratch brings up a lot of things.
[05:12:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's good to be able to work on both.
[05:13:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: along those same lines i talked with someone from incross last night
[05:13:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... they got widgets too?
[05:13:51] <arschmitz> they make a pretty crazy jquery mobile wysiwyg  editor and thier own widget
[05:14:02] <arschmitz> yes they want to contribute in the same way as samsung
[05:14:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: To web-ui-fw?
[05:14:25] <arschmitz> right now they are working on re-writeing everything to follow our widget standards patterns
[05:14:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *scratch head* ...
[05:14:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no not web-ui-fw
[05:14:51] <arschmitz> its a tool called davanci
[05:15:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I went and made jQM a submodule of web-ui-fw and basically copied the directory layout and everything.
[05:15:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I'm putting all the widgets back in one at a time with AMD deps right into jQM.
[05:15:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i told him we were re-writeing the widget in 1.4 to follow all the widget factory best standards and practices and they were really happy about that
[05:16:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:yeah i think thats going to be really awesome
[05:16:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but a /lot/ of work ... 
[05:16:48] <arschmitz> they were really bummed when i told them we were releasing 1.3 this month though
[05:16:59] <arschmitz> they are just putting the final touches on updateing to 1.2 lol
[05:18:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's not a good approach. They should be working against master.
[05:18:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i know... but part of it was switching to our widgets vs custom ones
[05:19:05] <arschmitz> i had not realized when i met with them in korea but they for some reason made all their own widget and didnt use any of the jqm ones ???
[05:19:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then maybe working with master will be their next step.
[05:19:41] <arschmitz> one of the people i talked to a lot while there though convinced them they had to switch over to standard widgets
[05:19:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, my experience with trying to build jQM apps is that if you want something that doesn't "look" like jQM, you need to make your own widgets.
[05:20:00] <arschmitz> next time i talk to them i will mention working against master though
[05:20:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but if you're writing your own widgets that duplicate jQM, well, that's a waste of time.
[05:20:40] <arschmitz> yeah i think they pretty much were
[05:20:52] <arschmitz> because they were close enough i didnt notice in their little presentation
[05:21:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wow!
[05:21:04] <arschmitz> like they had a pretty normal looking listview and stuff
[05:21:15] <_|Nix|_> Hopy cow!
[05:21:19] <_|Nix|_> s/p/l/
[05:21:36] <arschmitz> yeah its crazy
[05:21:52] <arschmitz> i told them i thought that was a REALLY good step to move to our widget
[05:22:03] <_|Nix|_> Indeed ...
[05:22:26] <arschmitz> over all though their tool is crazy it has a visual databinding feature thats really cool
[05:22:42] <arschmitz> they built a twitter app in under 5 minutes 
[05:22:57] <arschmitz> using jqm
[05:23:57] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[05:24:15] <arschmitz> yeah even had like the pull down to update and stuff
[05:24:19] <_|Nix|_> That's like the new measuring stick for rapid prototyping :)
[05:24:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right it was crazy they put in the api link
[05:25:00] <arschmitz> and it gives a full tree of all the data in it
[05:25:39] <arschmitz> and you can just grab a piece and drag it onto a listview and it turns it into a feed of the info
[05:26:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: all of us that saw the presentation were really impressed
[05:31:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if your intrested here is their promo video for it http://vimeo.com/47724152 and here is they guy that iv been talking to his talk from jQuery asia http://vimeo.com/55067960
[05:31:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh never mind the second one unless you happen to speak korean
[05:33:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you want that issue with the left handle underneath the right handle... go ahead
[05:34:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I pushed the bigger chances, just some issue that i still need to look into
[05:34:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the first one is a good 3 minute demo of the tool though
[05:34:20] <uGoMobi> s/chances/changes/
[05:36:08] <arschmitz> uGoBobi: ok 
[05:36:20] <arschmitz> lol
[05:36:21] <uGoMobi> lol i like that nick
[05:36:47] <arschmitz> lol
[05:37:29] <arschmitz> im tired this morning up too late
[05:37:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just so i know in case i notice them what are you working on still
[05:38:03] <arschmitz> dont want to bug you if your already working on something lol
[05:40:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: rangeslider handle on IE7, rangeslider disabled opacity, rangeslider first input in fieldcontain > get rid of 3px spacing, see if we can add the dash with CSS :after
[05:41:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool i tried to do the dash with after but i couldnt get it to work right
[05:41:41] <arschmitz> but i havent used after much was probably doing something wrong lol
[05:41:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah maybe it's not possible... didn't work for me either
[05:42:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe lol would make me feel better lol 
[05:42:18] <uGoMobi> maybe doesn't work with input
[05:46:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I gave the rangeslider and slider a small margin (half handle width) left and right
[05:46:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool i had it that way before (for range)  i must have undone it at some point i refactored the whole thing like 8 times ha ha 
[05:47:14] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:47:39] <arschmitz> just thinking of better ways to do things lol
[05:47:49] <uGoMobi> looks better full width but have to make sure the handle is on the screen
[05:48:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I needed like 5 attempts to get that slider full width :/
[05:48:37] <uGoMobi> fieldcontain makes it a bit more complicated
[05:48:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: uGoMobi: your telling me lol
[05:48:50] <uGoMobi> i had to wrap it in a div
[05:49:14] <arschmitz> filedcontains were a huge pain for me lol
[05:49:20] <uGoMobi> now the problem is.. i can't put the input after the label on small screens
[05:50:05] <arschmitz> oh yeah thats a pain
[05:51:17] <uGoMobi> so maybe i have to not only wrap the input and slider but also the label :(
[05:51:34] <uGoMobi> would be the same as rangeslider
[05:51:46] <uGoMobi> pfff
[05:52:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup thats the only reason it works for range slider is the dual wrap
[05:52:49] <arschmitz> but range kinda has to be like that
[05:52:52] <uGoMobi> well with rangeslider the inputs are not wrapped in a div together with sliders
[05:53:02] <uGoMobi> that makes it harder to style fieldcontain
[05:53:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: true
[05:57:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it doesn't really look good now if you use both slider and rangeslider in a form http://jquerymobile.com/branches/range/docs/demos/sliders/sliders.html
[05:57:31] <uGoMobi> on small screens i mean
[05:58:05] <arschmitz> yeah would be much better to make the inputs sit beside label like range visually
[06:00:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: rangeslider is broken in field contain
[06:00:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: on chrome after resize right?
[06:00:51] <arschmitz> yup
[06:01:06] <uGoMobi> i noticed it
[06:01:10] <uGoMobi> it's only on chrome
[06:01:22] <uGoMobi> and only after resizing 
[06:01:24] <arschmitz> weird it was ok before any idea whats causing it ?
[06:01:58] <uGoMobi> no, not yet but I will look into it
[06:02:27] <uGoMobi> maybe because i use two media queries now
[06:03:27] <arschmitz> weird ok 
[06:10:19] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15halcyon1234 opened issue #5392: Themeroller - Get Rolling message appears every visit  02http://git.io/Lcq_Nw
[06:14:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: :after is not possible on inputs
[06:14:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ahh that explains it
[06:15:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is a regression in range from something
[06:16:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what do you mean?
[06:16:11] <arschmitz> clicking on the extreams no longer targets the closest handle
[06:17:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill figure it out
[06:18:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok thanks... I know I made a lot of changes to the CSS... not because it wasn't good before, but because it was the only way to get consistency between rangeslider and slider
[06:19:07] <uGoMobi> so... sorry for breaking things
[06:19:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: best guess is its just a changed class name
[06:19:18] <arschmitz> im sure its nothing major
[06:19:55] <uGoMobi> i did rename the class name that i changed 
[06:20:35] <uGoMobi> div.ui-slider became ui-slider-app because now the wrapper div has class ui-slider
[06:29:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i found the commit just trying to see what it is im guessing it was a typo because the commit is just a coding standards commit
[06:31:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh oh... could it be the strict equal change i made?
[06:31:57] <arschmitz> actually i think it is i was just seeing if it was that
[06:32:19] <arschmitz> i broke slider the exact same way while i was working on it
[06:32:38] <arschmitz> oh this surely should be a strict equals then all of a sudden stuff dosent work
[06:32:49] <uGoMobi> hmm
[06:33:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: i missed two things, can you add withspace here when you commit fix for the regression...
[06:34:01] <uGoMobi> line 142    thisSlider.val( first ? max: min).slider( "refresh" );
[06:34:20] <uGoMobi> line 149    otherSlider.val(first? min: max).slider( "refresh" );
[06:34:53] <uGoMobi> s/withspace/whitespace/
[06:40:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that wasent it 
[06:40:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but i also had the commit wrong
[06:41:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, so it is something in the CSS then
[06:41:46] <arschmitz> yup im looking now its one of 2 commits not sure which because one of them wont load  because of a js error
[06:48:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it was the ui-slider vs ui-slider-app change but still something else funny so it might be a minute
[06:48:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think that change came together with all CSS changes
[06:49:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah its an issue in the js though i think 
[06:49:55] <arschmitz> im sure its nothign major
[06:56:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: found it 
[06:56:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: typo
[06:57:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi "mobileslider "
[06:57:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah great that you found it
[06:57:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah nothing big and just that and switching ui-slider to ui-slider-app

[07:16:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think we are safe to close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4686 dosent sound like there is going to be a fix
[07:18:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am not sure johnbender wanted to look into that
[07:18:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ahh ok 
[07:18:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: let's ask during meeting today
[07:18:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds goo
[07:23:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: grrr... another regression.. can't get focus on the rangeslider inputs when in fieldcontain
[07:24:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the slider is covering them
[07:26:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, z-index doesnt fix it
[07:26:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i noticed but something is weird
[07:26:34] <arschmitz> because i can get them to work
[07:26:46] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:26:46] <arschmitz> but sometimes they dont
[07:27:01] <uGoMobi> set focus on handle first i think
[07:28:08] <uGoMobi> nah thats not it
[07:28:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its that the slider doesnt cover very top of button
[07:28:40] <uGoMobi> ah right
[07:28:41] <arschmitz> if you click very top it set focus to the input and then works fine
[07:29:14] <arschmitz> but as soon as it blurs it doesnt work again
[07:30:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am thinking about wrapping the range-sliders and inputs together in another div
[07:30:37] <uGoMobi> I don't like all this wrappers
[07:30:54] <uGoMobi> but it would make it a lot easier to style the fieldcontain
[07:30:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no it makes things really funky espically since range already has 2 wraps
[07:31:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh ok
[07:31:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i didnt mean funky it wont work just a lot of added elements
[07:31:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I understand
[07:41:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im kind of confused why z-index does not fix it since they are in the same stacking context?
[07:43:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: i have no idea yet
[07:46:36] <arschmitz> :( position absolute
[07:46:59] <arschmitz> the sliders have position absolute which breaks them out of the stacking content
[07:47:02] <arschmitz> context
[07:47:53] <scottjehl__> hio
[07:48:10] <arschmitz> hi scottjehl__
[07:48:18] <uGoMobi> hi scottjehl__ 
[07:48:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: true, but the sliders aren't on top of the inputs, only the range-sliders div which is positioned relative
[07:49:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good point hmmm 
[07:49:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but you might be right that that is what prevents z-index from resolving the issue
[07:56:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: got it
[07:56:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: tell me
[07:57:15] <arschmitz> on inputs add
[07:57:20] <arschmitz> position:relative;
[07:57:25] <arschmitz> z-index:1;
[07:57:54] <uGoMobi> ahaa... good one!
[07:58:01] <arschmitz> because the sliders div has a position it starts a new stacking context
[07:58:11] <arschmitz> so we just need to add position to the inputs so they do to
[07:58:23] <uGoMobi> perfect
[07:58:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup :)
[07:58:54] <arschmitz> i knew z-index should work lol they are siblings !
[07:59:37] <uGoMobi> yeah, i didn't understand it either
[07:59:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: z-index can be so weird sometimes with stacking contexts 
[07:59:52] <uGoMobi> but good point about we set position for range-sliders
[08:00:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think its one of the single hardest css properties to fully understand
[08:00:50] <uGoMobi> it is

[08:28:19] <arschmitz> morning gseguin
[09:05:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so looking into the ie7 issue this is rough
[09:06:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah guess so
[09:06:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is no good solution for it ie7 does not break position absolute elements out of the stacking context like it should the only work around is to set a higher z-index on parent
[09:07:07] <arschmitz> which wont work here it will just make the left slider have the issue instead
[09:07:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BTW - looks like the disabled rangeslider now doesn't have any oppacity at all
[09:07:16] <arschmitz> err right slider i mean
[09:07:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what browser works fine for me in chrome?
[09:08:15] <uGoMobi> yeah chrome
[09:08:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and firefox
[09:09:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: FF same issue
[09:09:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the disabled rangeslider works perfect for me in chrome and firefox and ie7 (havent checked anything else)
[09:11:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: for me means local i suppose?
[09:11:44] <arschmitz> yes
[09:12:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: or is the idea that add class ui-disabled to the rangeslider div?
[09:12:41] <uGoMobi> I add*
[09:13:02] <arschmitz> the branch preview doesnt look up to date
[09:13:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I check local after pulling commits
[09:13:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see you have set opacity 1 for the sliders
[09:13:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes 
[09:13:52] <arschmitz> then set ui-disabled on the container
[09:14:08] <uGoMobi> aha... so you have to add a class?
[09:14:13] <arschmitz> yes
[09:14:45] <uGoMobi> cos on the test page I just added the disabled attribute to the input type range
[09:15:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we can have the JS do this
[09:15:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its being done in the js already
[09:15:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I added variable isRangeslider to slider.js
[09:15:34] <arschmitz> just need to have it not only check the option but for the prop on inputs
[09:16:06] <arschmitz> right now it only checks the option on rangeslider not the prop on the inputs to see if it should add the class to the container
[09:16:18] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:16:27] <arschmitz> i didnt think of that so just need to adjust
[09:16:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: in the odd case of only one input having the prop what do you think we should do?
[09:18:03] <uGoMobi> but slider.js adds the class ui-disabled to the slider and i was thinking we can change that so in case of rangeslider the class will be added to div range-sliders... then we don't need to set opacity 1 anymore either
[09:18:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but then still you are right that we need to check the elements, not only the option
[09:18:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ahh ok i see what your saying
[09:18:59] <arschmitz> but yeah we still need to deal with what if only one has the prop
[09:19:17] <arschmitz> anyway i have to run for like an hour ill be back before the meeting
[09:19:29] <uGoMobi> i would say.. as soon as one is disabled... disable the whole thing
[09:19:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds good to me
[09:19:44] <arschmitz> simple that way
[09:20:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: need to decide what to do about ie7 it looks like only solution would be a rather large ie7 specific extension
[09:20:16] <uGoMobi> yup and responsibility of the dev 
[09:20:30] <uGoMobi> hmm
[09:20:37] <arschmitz> or just say sorry ie7 sucks
[09:20:38] <uGoMobi> ok you run.. we discuss later
[09:20:48] <uGoMobi> i think the latter
[09:20:55] <arschmitz> me too
[09:21:00] <arschmitz> bbl
[09:28:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi: we can close that bug according to kin
[09:28:36] <johnbender> not much we can do
[09:29:10] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, thanks ... will take care of that

[10:41:11] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi 
[10:41:15] <toddmparker> guess we need an agenda

[10:48:34] <uGoMobi> anyone else having problems to open the agenda?
[10:49:44] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, I have been able to request access, waiting to get it...
[10:50:17] <agcolom> I think the easiest is for toddmparker to change the access rules of the docs
[10:50:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ah I think my request has been sent too
[10:50:36] <uGoMobi> yeah
[10:50:38] <johnbender> toddmparker: I requested access
[10:51:22] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... *scratch head* ... this is new ...
[10:52:03] <_|Nix|_> Whatever happened to public documents?
[10:52:20] <uGoMobi> they are classified now ;-)

[10:52:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, no ears or mouth or nose ...
[10:52:59] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:54:17] * _|Nix|_ keeps refreshing that agenda link after having requested access, but still no dice.
[10:57:20] <toddmparker> agenda is public to edit now
[10:57:33] <toddmparker> sorry!
[10:57:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Awesome! Thanks! NP.
[10:58:16] <uGoMobi> looks like I can't edit
[10:58:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you edit the doc?
[10:58:26] <toddmparker> still?
[10:58:30] <arschmitz> i cant either
[10:58:34] <arschmitz> i can view but not edit
[10:58:40] <uGoMobi> yes same here

[10:59:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I only have read-only access.
[10:59:12] <arschmitz> says view only
[10:59:22] <toddmparker> ah, sorry
[10:59:24] <toddmparker> fixed
[10:59:35] <toddmparker> confusing settings
[10:59:36] <uGoMobi> yeahhh
[11:02:00] <mspisars> i saw a discussion about ie7 a bit up... why does jqm support ie7 when major companies have left it long ago (a year now for Facebook)?

[11:02:48] <toddmparker> mspisars: a good question. i though we had shifted ie7 to c grade
[11:03:14] <arschmitz> mspisars: toddmparker no just 6
[11:03:17] <toddmparker> we're using multi-class selectors now so that would break IE7, tight uGoMobi 
[11:03:28] <arschmitz> ie7 isnt really much different then 8 in 90% of cases
[11:03:31] <scottjehl__> that'd break 6 not 7
[11:03:32] <toddmparker> need to look at that for 1.3
[11:03:38] <scottjehl__> (multi class)
[11:03:50] <toddmparker> ah, thanks scottjehl__ 
[11:03:55] <scottjehl__> I think we mostly supported IE7 because we had little trouble doing so
[11:03:58] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: multi selectors work on IE7
[11:04:04] <scottjehl__> is there a good reason to drop it?
[11:04:12] <arschmitz> i dont think so
[11:04:14] <toddmparker> scottjehl__: i just updated the docs re: overlay default
[11:04:15] <mspisars> i know that ie8 also has issues (i can't even come to terms with ie9) but it seems like wasted effort on ie7
[11:04:17] <arschmitz> its essentially the same as 8
[11:04:33] <toddmparker> yeah, if it's not causing issues, we'd keep supporting it
[11:04:37] <toddmparker> meeting time!
[11:04:37] <arschmitz> i mean if there is something really nasty on 7 just document
[11:05:07] <scottjehl__> I agree marketshare is important to consider. To me, dropping a browser in support level is mostly about how much we'd save in removing workarounds and such
[11:05:22] <scottjehl__> I can't think of many in there for IE7 is all
[11:05:30] <scottjehl__> but... good question for sure
[11:05:36] <scottjehl__> maybe there are
[11:10:27] <arschmitz> johnbender: meeting time!
[11:10:29] <johnbender> scottjehl__: don't we have a lot of generate markup workaround for the IE's
[11:10:32] <johnbender> arschmitz: ah thank
[11:12:41] <gseguin> toddmparker: is there something I can pick up that can help the release?

[11:56:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: now you mention index.php... do you understand where did is coming from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5353
[12:01:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lemme check locally ...
[12:01:36] <uGoMobi> s/did/this/
[12:01:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I doubt it's from master.
[12:01:59] <uGoMobi> me too
[12:02:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... I bet it's a bad merge somewhere ...
[12:02:29] <uGoMobi> maybe it is because we merged branch master into a branch?
[12:02:40] <uGoMobi> that must be it
[12:03:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ^^^
[12:05:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, because if you merge branch master, than the files mentioned there will also be merged into that branch.
[12:05:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah of course
[12:05:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... unless you merge at the point where the files are added to index.php but not yet added to the tree.
[12:05:52] <uGoMobi> true
[12:06:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But usually files get added to the tree before they are referenced from index.php.
[12:06:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, slide-panel-refactor does not produce such errors.
[12:06:34] <uGoMobi> yeah and the files that are reported at the issues aren't all added at once
[12:11:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, this could be any one of a large number of branches.
[12:11:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm not going to check them all. I'll let Krinkle answer.
[12:11:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I saw you asked again
[12:11:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you are right
[12:11:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we'll see
[12:12:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If it's a branch preview URL, then such warnings should be transient.
[12:12:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I noticed branch previews stay alive, even when we delete the branch
[12:13:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[12:13:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was thinking that for view source we should strip the trailing \n from the text so as to avoid that extra blank line at the bottom of the code.
[12:14:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... although, technically it should be there.
[12:14:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah, I have been looking into that
[12:14:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Whaddya think?
[12:15:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: even when there was no line break in the markup anymore I still got that additional 1 or 2 lines at the end
[12:15:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: would be nice if you can clean that up
[12:15:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, maybe contents() adds it.
[12:15:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I couldn't figure it out that time
[12:16:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: also because I am not a master in regex
[12:16:31] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:16:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: will you use a regex that finds the line break but only when it's at the end?
[12:18:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm curious how $ behaves in a multiline string ...
[12:18:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm also not very good with JS regex.
[12:19:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: And multi-line regex is always tricky.
[12:19:27] <uGoMobi> it is
[12:19:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wait /m/ultiline - that's probably what the m is for!
[12:19:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, /regex/mg
[12:19:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: m is for multiline, I'm thinking.
[12:20:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what we could do is add a certain string to div that we use to clone the source code
[12:20:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, it should be easy ... .replace( /\n+$/mg, "" )
[12:20:39] <uGoMobi> and then look for the line break followed by that string
[12:21:03] * _|Nix|_ fires up Chrome Dev Tools ...
[12:21:11] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:22:03] <_|Nix|_> That's the regex we need.
[12:22:27] <uGoMobi> we also have keep in mind that it is different on Linux Windows and Mac
[12:22:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good point.
[12:23:01] <_|Nix|_> "abc\ndef\nghi\n\n".replace( /[\r\n]+$/mg, "" );
[12:23:06] <uGoMobi> ... \r\n for Win \r for Mac and \n for Linux 
[12:23:12] <uGoMobi> if I am not mistaken
[12:23:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ^^ pretty sure
[12:23:34] <_|Nix|_> So, the above regex should work.
[12:23:39] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:24:23] <_|Nix|_> JS actually makes multiline easy.
[12:24:35] <_|Nix|_> It changes the meaning of $ from newline to end-of-string.
[12:24:39] <uGoMobi> the \gm flag?
[12:25:05] <_|Nix|_> g means global - IOW, if it contains the regex twice, replace both.
[12:25:12] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:25:17] <uGoMobi> m multiline?
[12:25:21] <_|Nix|_> m means multiline - IOW \n does not equal $
[12:25:43] <_|Nix|_> So, when you match against $, you're matching against the end of the string.
[12:25:48] <uGoMobi> i checked i the other day but I already forgot what it was for
[12:25:58] <uGoMobi> ok nice
[12:26:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I never did know until now :)
[12:26:03] <uGoMobi> ^ for the beginning
[12:26:07] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[12:26:08] <uGoMobi> ?
[12:26:26] <_|Nix|_> JS regex is pretty standard otherwise.
[12:28:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: got a fix for ie7 
[12:28:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[12:28:54] <arschmitz> its ie7 specific so i just need to qualify it and ill push
[12:29:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what is the fix? a popup with "install Chrome please"?
[12:29:43] <uGoMobi> ;-)
[12:30:21] <arschmitz> basicly just append the first handle to the second slider then i have to proxy the events to the first slider and return false
[12:30:48] <arschmitz> need to test to make sure it dosent mess anything else up
[12:31:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: isn't that a bit similar to what scottjehl__ suggested for rangeslider in general?
[12:31:39] <uGoMobi> use the input value but get rid of its slider
[12:31:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not that simple. It's trailing whitespace. There are tabs in there too.
[12:32:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: at least that was what  I understood from it... we can discuss tomorrow
[12:32:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm
[12:32:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP. There's a handy-dany escape sequence for whitespace: \s
[12:33:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... I just learned.
[12:33:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: kinda execpt they were saying move everything into slider and make it just an option on slider
[12:33:35] <arschmitz> which is a lot more complicated
[12:34:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, I think i used that for fieldContain.js to remove spaces between inline-block elements
[12:34:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and make it so there was only one track 
[12:34:50] <arschmitz> this just passes the event
[12:34:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I got it working, although now it looks like it could use more padding. But that's just my aesthetically challenged opinion.
[12:36:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: let's look into pros and cons tomorrow
[12:36:50] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/CgnMFw
[12:36:50] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14320697b 15Gabriel Schulhof: Demos: View source: yank trailing whitespace from source code.
[12:36:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pushed. Check it out.
[12:37:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[12:37:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there are pros for sure cons is mainly wont be ready for 1.3
[12:37:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also slider itself needs a lot of work
[12:38:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh I just moved rangeslider in the roadmap from 1.4 to 1.3
[12:38:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I agree
[12:38:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i think this is more of a temp until we have time to tackle slider as a whole 
[12:38:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: then roll them together
[12:39:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: like i dont think slider should be tied to an input
[12:39:41] <arschmitz> decoupling from inputs would make it a lot easier then just have a call back to update the inputs
[12:39:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: downside of landing to soon is that we always have to be careful when chaning things in the framework
[12:39:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Amen!
[12:40:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It should be possible to do a slider with a simple div.
[12:40:06] <uGoMobi> people will complain if you change things often
[12:40:48] <uGoMobi> I am talking about bigger changes 
[12:41:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Making slider work with a div is a huge change!
[12:41:14] <arschmitz> massive
[12:41:15] <uGoMobi> it is
[12:41:30] <arschmitz> at that point its a breaking change no matter what
[12:41:36] <uGoMobi> so if you just landed rangeslider and the next main release you completely change it
[12:41:42] <_|Nix|_> Maybe step 0 should be to separate out the select-based slider from the range-based one.
[12:41:44] <arschmitz> so best to keep any real changes for then i think
[12:41:57] <uGoMobi> not sure if that is a good idea for a framework
[12:42:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Absolutely. We cannot break API.
[12:42:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[12:42:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it wouldnt break api you just make it look for the old way as well
[12:42:49] <_|Nix|_> Look at the Linux kernel. Only last week did they break compatibility with i386!
[12:42:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: don't get me wrong.. I really like the rangeslider how it is now
[12:43:05] <_|Nix|_> That means until last week the kernel could be booted on a 386!
[12:43:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just saying that we might have to reconsider if it's a good idea to land it in 1.3
[12:43:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, like uGoMobi is saynig. We really need to make sure you can do everything you want rangeslider to do within the API we end up publishing.
[12:44:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can add API, but we cannot change existing API without a releases-long deprecation process.
[12:44:44] <arschmitz> absolutely but range takes no options other then the ones slider does now so as long as we dont break slider we wont break range
[12:45:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are opttions its only API?
[12:45:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Does it have a refresh method?
[12:45:27] <arschmitz> yes
[12:45:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Does it have its own data-attributes?
[12:45:34] <arschmitz> yes it has refresh
[12:45:41] <arschmitz> no it does not only role
[12:45:46] <arschmitz> which would stay the same
[12:45:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So how does it set a value?
[12:46:02] <arschmitz> no methods or attributes of its own
[12:46:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: slider has one value, whereas this has two.
[12:46:22] <arschmitz> refresh does not set a value
[12:46:25] <uGoMobi> so as long as we decide it won't become an option for slider we would be safe?
[12:46:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait, it uses two inputs, right?
[12:46:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right
[12:46:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: correct it would always need its own role thats all
[12:47:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, we can still make it an option for slider. We would simply abandon the rangeslider code when we make it an option for slider.
[12:47:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That would be the embodiment of the deprecation process.
[12:47:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ right we just would have both trigger same widget
[12:47:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[12:47:43] <arschmitz> but with different options
[12:47:47] <uGoMobi> right
[12:47:52] <arschmitz> so there is no api issues
[12:48:00] <arschmitz> i did it that way intentionally 
[12:48:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you mean with different options? All options are given in the markup.
[12:48:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's good.
[12:48:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: speaking about broken API... source view is broken
[12:48:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Uh-oh. What'd I mess up?
[12:49:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when I look at swipe demo I only get the CSS source 
[12:49:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just that using data-role="rangeslider" would set the rangeslider option on slider to true or what ever
[12:49:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no JS and HtML
[12:49:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and the prevent scroll code seems not to work anymore
[12:50:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... weird ... lemme check ... I was seeing HTML just fine.
[12:50:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ignore that last line... scroll works as expected
[12:50:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, *whew* ... I wouldn't've known how to fix that ....
[12:50:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hang on  I will check on incognito mode
[12:51:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: so i dont think there would be any issue moving from seperate widgets to one widget in the future api wise
[12:51:50] <arschmitz> since both widgets have the same api
[12:52:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You're right ... redirect used to have both HTML and PHP and JS. Now it only has JS ...
[12:52:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly
[12:52:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and others only have CSS
[12:52:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll fix it.
[12:53:23] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:53:46] <_|Nix|_> I'm an idiot™
[12:53:59] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:54:02] <uGoMobi> your words

[13:20:56] <uGoMobi> good night all
[13:22:10] <gseguin> later Jasper
[13:25:44] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[13:26:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good night and also all is fixed on range
[13:26:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/range/js/widgets/forms/rangeslider.js#L12 I don't think you need a widgetEventPrefix if it's the same as your widget name. Besides, IINM it's deprecated in UI.
[13:26:47] <arschmitz> ie7 is all good an no ie7 specific workaround needed
[13:27:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh cool ill remove it didnt realize that
[13:29:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Your range slider could benefit from on-the-fly slider options. Like, if someone sets mini on the rangeslider but not its child sliders it's up to you to set mini on the child sliders. As it is, you have to go in there and muck about with the child sliders' classes instead of just calling .slider( "option", "mini", newValue ) on them.
[13:30:15] <_|Nix|_> That widget review ... *shake head* ...
[13:30:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah bunch of things that need to be fixed in slider
[13:31:17] <arschmitz> like you can call destroy on rangeslider but it only undoes the range part sliders stay sliders
[13:31:24] <arschmitz> because they dont have _destroy
[13:33:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... that sucks ... but if rangeslider ends up in 1.3.0, it might be OK to backport slider _destroy() to 1.3.1 ...
[13:33:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats not a breaking change its a fix so i think it would be ok
[13:33:46] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[13:34:46] <toddmparker> interesting: http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201212/ios_webkit_browsers_and_auto-zooming_form_controls/
[13:34:46] <bot-t> (33 hours 40 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell toddmparker : see this comment https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3712#issuecomment-11526581 ... was wondering if selects will work in panels on Android 2.3 assuming we will still force hardware acceleration there after the refactor
[13:37:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You don't need enable and disable. You call refresh() from setOption, right? Well, the widget factory implements enable and disable, and calls _setOption( "disabled", false resp. true ) from both.
[13:37:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So you could move the class juggling into refresh.
[13:37:35] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: When developing panels for 1.3, we ran into this issue again because we use translateX for animating them and fixed positioning. That broke selects in Android 2.x. To work around this, we used the same 3D support test as page transitions to not apply these rules to non-3D browsers like 2.x.
[13:37:35] <toddmparker> Happy to report that selects seem to work well in the new panels.
[13:37:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: good point i forgot thouse got auto called from setoption
[13:37:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and you don't need to worry about setting this.options.disabled - the class factory does that for you.
[13:38:49] <arschmitz> oh actually im changing that for anoother reason already
[13:39:06] <arschmitz> the class handling is actually moving to slider
[13:39:17] <arschmitz> out of rangeslider completely
[13:39:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: added an israngeslider prop to slider
[13:39:57] <arschmitz> so if it is it will now set the disabled class on the wrapper rather then the slider to avoid a z-index issue
[13:40:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: this.element.find( "input" ).slider( this.options.disabled ? "disable" : "enable" ); this.sliders.toggleClass( "ui-disabled", this.options.disabled );
[13:40:08] <arschmitz> so those can go away completely
[13:41:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We're gonna have .toggleClass( "ui-disabled", valueOfDisabled )  in so many places ... that's why I filed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5390
[13:41:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it was already on my radar for 1.4
[13:42:08] <arschmitz> i just forgot you didnt need the methods explicitly
[13:42:27] <arschmitz> rangeslider now does not have disable or enable at all
[13:42:48] <arschmitz> or any thing to do with it in refresh it just calls refresh and slider handles it
[13:43:11] <arschmitz> but without set option on slider its still not really the "right" way
[13:43:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's right, but you've still offloaded a lot.
[13:43:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[13:43:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just curious. How many LOC did that get rid of?
[13:44:35] <arschmitz> 12
[13:47:16] <_|Nix|_> Not bad.
[13:49:05] <arschmitz> nope
[13:52:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You know what? Don't add an option to slider.
[13:52:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Add a private method and call it.
[13:52:23] <arschmitz> option for what?
[13:52:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Don't worry about encapsulation, because it's the same library.
[13:52:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: israngeslider.
[13:52:56] <arschmitz> oh uGoMobi: already did it and its not an optioon if i said option i didnt mean to
[13:53:09] <arschmitz> he extends the widget with it
[13:53:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You didn't, but I assume you meant it.
[13:53:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh.
[13:53:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, with a behaviour?
[13:53:36] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:53:41] <arschmitz> wait no
[13:54:07] <arschmitz> in create he just added it to $.extend(this, { ... });
[13:54:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, that's fine.
[13:54:33] <arschmitz> yeah pretty standard we extend most of our widgets with things that way
[13:55:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually not sure if those things aren't technically considered public unless they have a _ prefix ...
[13:55:31] <arschmitz> hmm im not sure let me try lol
[13:55:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I try to always $.extend( { this, { _variable1: value, _variable2: value, ... } );
[13:56:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just to be on the safe side. But my variables are a vast minority compared to the rest of jQM.
[13:56:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: wont let you call them unless they are a method
[13:56:41] <arschmitz> so varibles can be accessed 
[13:56:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright, I guess that's OK then.
[13:57:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... since the structure in which they're contained is itself private.
[13:57:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[14:03:50] <arschmitz> ok everyone im heading out early today head is killing me

[15:18:07] <johnbender> toddmparker: I accepted the invite for tomorrow
