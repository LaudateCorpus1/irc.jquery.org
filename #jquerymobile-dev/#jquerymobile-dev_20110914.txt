[08:10:51] <_nickel> toddmparker: toddparker nicely handled on the middle click issue
[08:11:10] <_nickel> we go out of our way to be helpful and I think its fair to expect some courtesy on the other end
[08:19:12] <_nickel> kinblas: working on that event issue
[08:19:25] <_nickel> kinblas: if nothing else i want to add your suggestion to the wiki page as a feature
[08:19:33] <_nickel> and event lifecycle would be brilliant
[08:20:03] <_nickel> for now I've defined the _init function in jquery.mobile.widget.js which is called after the page create is triggered
[08:20:15] <_nickel> in it I trigger "pageaftercreate"
[08:20:31] <_nickel> so people can modify the pages after the other widgets have run
[08:21:06] <_nickel> gseguin toddmparker: toddmparker: ^ I'm going to send out a quick email with the compareview for everyone to take a look at
[08:33:28] <toddparker> _ni
[08:33:36] <toddparker> _nickel: agree
[08:34:11] <_nickel> toddparker: posted the compare view to the issue
[08:34:35] <toddparker> thanks!
[08:34:59] <_nickel> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/gg192966?pp3#_RevHistory
[08:35:00] <_nickel> yay!
[08:35:00] <toddparker> I'll defer to the other guys on the code side of things, but I like the idea of a quick and dirty hook
[08:37:03] <_nickel> dirty being the key phrase there
[08:37:20] <_nickel> I'll probably be the exagerated voice of "no more features" for the next month
[08:37:45] <toddparker> i'm 100% on board with no changes,just bug fixes
[08:37:51] <_nickel> yah buddy!
[08:37:52] <_nickel> kk
[08:37:55] <_nickel> I'll wait for kin
[08:38:02] <_nickel> and then add docs / feature request to the wiki
[08:38:14] <gseguin> 'morning all
[08:38:18] <_nickel> hopefully the guys on the thread will also respond to make sure that will work for them
[08:38:22] <_nickel> gseguin: hallo!
[08:38:58] <gseguin> toddparker: looks like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2438 is an issue on FF after all
[08:38:59] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #2438 on jquery-mobile, reported by sinewave42 (5h, 20m ago): Documentation - middle clicking link does not open target in new tab
[08:39:03] <gseguin> I just tested it
[08:39:18] <gseguin> right click indeed navigates to the link
[08:40:04] <_nickel> oh bizarre
[08:40:07] <_nickel> I can confirm
[08:40:10] <toddparker> seems like a FF bug?
[08:40:16] <gseguin> could be
[08:40:17] <toddparker> these are just links, right?
[08:40:19] <_nickel> certainly does
[08:40:28] <_nickel> I'll check a simple demo page one sec
[08:40:37] <toddparker> what is a middle click ?!?!?
[08:40:47] <toddparker> rich click, but not?
[08:40:52] <toddparker> right ^
[08:41:06] <_nickel> middle and right
[08:41:11] <_nickel> same with a plain ass link
[08:41:18] <gseguin> that guy must have some sort of mapping on his middle button
[08:41:36] <_nickel> gseguin: nope I can confirm the same for mine
[08:41:42] <_nickel> middle click opens new tabs
[08:41:49] <_nickel> toddparker: 3 button mouse
[08:41:52] <_nickel> common
[08:41:57] <_nickel> thinkpads have them
[08:42:01] <gseguin> _nickel: yeah same here
[08:42:17] <_nickel> depressing the scrollwheel on most mouses is a middleclick
[08:42:20] <gseguin> but he was expecting it to open in a different tab
[08:42:26] <_nickel> gseguin: yep
[08:42:30] <_nickel> thats the normal behaviour for me
[08:42:32] <gseguin> and that can only be custom mapping
[08:42:32] <_nickel> in all browsers
[08:42:36] <_nickel> I've always used that
[08:42:36] <gseguin> oh really
[08:42:44] <gseguin> had no idea
[08:42:51] <_nickel> incidentally it something we're dong
[08:42:57] <_nickel> a vanilla link works
[08:43:25] <toddparker> hmmm
[08:43:42] <toddparker> but you can right click on the link?
[08:43:48] <toddparker> or Control click?
[08:45:09] <_nickel> toddparker: both cause the issue
[08:45:15] <_nickel> middle or right click
[08:45:35] <_nickel> makes it hard to inspect the page lol
[08:46:05] <_nickel> toddparker: I can boil this one down if you like
[08:46:10] <_nickel> I'm enjoying getting these notches on my belt
[08:46:52] * gseguin is having merge issue
[08:47:55] <toddparker> go for it _nickel, but I wouldn't spend too much time
[08:48:41] <_nickel> toddparker: noted
[08:48:44] <_nickel> I won't :D
[08:55:08] <_nickel> toddparker: I think this one might be better handled by kin
[08:55:22] <_nickel> removing our click handlind in nav seems to solve the issue
[08:55:23] <_nickel> one sec
[08:58:14] <_nickel> toddparker: gseguin: event.which tells us which mouse button was clicked, I'm going to try ignoring when greater than 1 and see what happens
[08:58:36] <gseguin> _nickel: sounds good
[08:59:48] <gseguin> _nickel: irssi question
[08:59:55] <_nickel> gseguin: yah buddy
[09:00:00] * _nickel hopes he can answer
[09:00:15] <gseguin> I don't get highlight if my nick is not the first word
[09:00:21] <gseguin> how do I fix that?
[09:00:42] <_nickel> gseguin: good questioni
[09:00:54] <_nickel> gseguin: there's a _world_ of irssi scripts out there
[09:01:08] <gseguin> do you have one like that?
[09:01:12] <_nickel> nope
[09:01:16] <_nickel> never had that issue
[09:01:22] <_nickel> can you test for me?
[09:01:28] <_nickel> something something _nickel
[09:01:41] <gseguin> something something _nickel something
[09:01:46] <_nickel> yah same
[09:01:47] <gseguin> did that highlight?
[09:01:48] <_nickel> let me look
[09:01:51] <_nickel> nope
[09:01:55] <gseguin> yeah that's painful
[09:05:07] <_nickel> gseguin: asking in #irssi
[09:05:12] <_nickel> I'll let you know what I come up with
[09:05:25] <gseguin> thanks!
[09:07:06] <gseguin> something something _nickel something
[09:10:21] <_nickel> toddparker: gseguin: I've verified that a finger click on android 2.3 is a event.which === 1
[09:10:31] <_nickel> I'm going to add a test and push
[09:10:55] <gseguin> cool, thanks _nickel
[09:11:03] <_nickel> although we do need to handle the link highlighting in that case :
[09:11:04] <_nickel> :(
[09:11:19] <_nickel> toddparker: should I bother with de-highlighting the link?
[09:11:28] <_nickel> or just add a todo
[09:12:52] <gseguin> _nickel: you can call httpCleanup
[09:13:16] <_nickel> gseguin: nice
[09:15:03] <gseguin> _nickel: or bail out of the vclick listener with the same if statement
[09:15:57] <_nickel> gseguin: in this case its only the click listener that appears to be the issue
[09:16:10] <_nickel> but I must admit that I don't fully understand the difference
[09:18:40] <_nickel> gseguin: I think in thise case it makes more sense to handle it in the "click" handler since it is in fact a click
[09:18:52] <_nickel> hmm
[09:18:57] <_nickel> maybe it doesn't much matter
[09:19:10] <gseguin> the click handler does the action
[09:19:19] <gseguin> the vclick handler sets the visual state
[09:20:00] <gseguin> vclick triggers before click
[09:20:03] <_nickel> yah
[09:20:10] <_nickel> alright
[09:20:15] <_nickel> I'll lift the check up there
[09:20:39] <_nickel> sigh
[09:20:52] <_nickel> although an extra return in that case adds a short circuit
[09:20:54] <_nickel> nevermin
[09:20:57] <_nickel> leaving it in click
[09:21:04] <_nickel> I've consolidated the "don't do anything checks"
[09:21:50] <gseguin> ok
[09:23:30] <_nickel> #foobizzle
[09:27:36] <gseguin> toddparker: do you have invites to irccloud?
[09:32:54] <toddparker> i can check
[09:33:00] <toddparker> gseguin ^
[09:33:07] <gseguin> thanks
[09:34:56] <toddparker> http://irccloud.com/ seems to be down
[09:35:21] <gseguin> oh that's why toddmparker got disconnected
[09:35:50] <toddparker> ya
[09:42:52] <toddparker> kinblas: don't you know people not he safari team?
[09:43:06] <toddparker> having a bad crashing bug with bostonglobe.com on safari lion
[09:43:29] <toddparker> need help understanding the logs
[09:52:40] <toddparker> just emailed with details kinblas
[10:07:25] <gseguin> kinblas, _nickel: any of you has an android keyboard with Swype keyboard on it?
[10:07:45] <_nickel> gseguin: nope :(
[10:07:56] <gseguin> s/android keyboard/android device/
[10:11:56] <_nickel> gseguin: kinblas: toddparker: the rightlick middle click fix is finished with tests
[10:12:02] <_nickel> just waiting for kinblas to chime in
[10:12:06] <_nickel> then I'll push to master
[10:14:59] <gseguin> _nickel: no need to do it in the vclick handler then?
[10:15:32] <_nickel> gseguin: nope I just consolidated the early exit stuff in the click handler
[10:15:39] <_nickel> ended up being simpler
[11:08:18] <gseguin> toddparker, toddmparker: style question
[11:08:38] <gseguin> http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/tests/test_1899.html
[11:09:02] <gseguin> section F is a single collapsible
[11:09:20] <toddparker> looking gseguin
[11:09:25] <gseguin> should bottom-corner be removed when it's expanded
[11:09:31] <gseguin> ?
[11:09:37] <gseguin> hi eddiemonge
[11:09:48] <gseguin> eddiemonge: no I won't be in Boston :(
[11:09:58] <toddparker> don't think so gseguin
[11:10:15] <toddparker> we remove the corners in an accordion because there are other headers
[11:10:16] <gseguin> toddparker: so how about "section G" ?
[11:10:39] <gseguin> section G is a collapsible set with only one collapsible in it
[11:10:45] <toddparker> F looks right, G by itself fit odd
[11:11:07] <toddparker> the bigger issue is that the body of these, esp. the accordion should have a stroke at least
[11:11:10] <toddparker> maybe a bg color
[11:11:36] <gseguin> or maybe border
[11:11:46] <toddparker> if that happened, then the single collapsible would be ok with a square header bottom b/c the body would have rounded corners at the bottom
[11:11:57] <toddparker> yeah
[11:12:02] <toddparker> i'd like to try this:
[11:12:12] <toddparker> just add a border from the theme
[11:12:17] <toddparker> negate the bg
[11:12:31] <toddparker> then G and E will make sense
[11:12:44] <toddparker> if the bottom of the content stroke has a rounded bottom
[11:13:08] <gseguin> negate the bg?
[11:17:55] <toddparker> add the theme class on the content
[11:18:06] <toddparker> then add a style override
[11:18:13] <toddparker> bg-image:none
[11:18:30] <toddparker> we can try it with a bg but it might be too much
[11:18:39] <gseguin> ok
[11:18:56] <toddparker> i'm open to odeas
[11:19:18] <toddparker> guess that should be a data option
[11:19:39] <toddparker> data-collapsiblecontent-theme
[11:19:42] <toddparker> ugh
[11:20:07] <gseguin> data-content-theme
[11:21:33] <eddiemonge> add bg-image inline?
[11:23:54] <toddparker> gseguin: like it
[11:24:34] <toddparker> eddiemonge: no, the collapsible plugin would add the swatch for the body (based on parent or data-)
[11:24:41] <toddparker> swatch class
[11:25:06] <toddparker> in the collapsible CSS, we can negate the bg image if we want
[11:25:12] <toddparker> so you'd just see the stroke
[11:25:16] <toddparker> or we can leave the bg there
[11:25:22] <toddparker> would be nice to test both
[11:26:32] <gseguin> doing the corner first
[11:26:41] <toddparker> k
[11:26:47] <gseguin> will let you know when I'm done
[11:26:50] <toddparker> well, the corner might depend on the style
[11:27:03] <toddparker> i guess we're going to do something - stroke, bg
[11:27:16] <toddparker> so the coner reounding will be needed. carry on
[11:27:40] <toddparker> i'd also like to see what this would look like w/o the white stroke/button around the +/- icons
[11:27:54] <toddparker> just the icon disc + icon
[11:28:11] <toddparker> sort of looks like a split button, but clicking the whole button toggles it
[11:34:31] <_nickel> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1335
[11:34:32] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #1335 on jquery-mobile, reported by anttears (5m, 2w ago): Label clicks not firing event on associated radio buttons
[11:34:38] <_nickel> I'm having a hard time understanding what the issue s
[11:34:42] <_nickel> *is
[11:35:12] <_nickel> is it just purely that the label should be setting which radio button is selected?
[11:37:52] <eddiemonge> its if an actual radio button has a click event attached to it, clicking the label doesnt trigger that click event. yeah they should be using change on the radio button though
[11:38:33] <eddiemonge> although there are cases where click is acceptable vs change
[11:39:10] <eddiemonge> but its only there if spans are added to the labels?
[11:44:52] <_nickel> toddparker: gseguin: kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1335
[11:44:53] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #1335 on jquery-mobile, reported by anttears (5m, 2w ago): Label clicks not firing event on associated radio buttons
[11:44:59] <_nickel> no idea what to make of that one
[11:45:09] <_nickel> montebrown's comment has completely confused me
[11:47:45] <eddiemonge> i commented it. it really does need a test case
[11:48:40] <gseguin> toddparker: does adding ui-border-* in theme.css make sense to you?
[11:48:40] <eddiemonge> montebrown is using 1.6 and attr('checked') isnt the way to do it. 1.6 uses .prop() to change checked
[11:50:35] <_nickel> eddiemonge: right, but I'm still confused about what the original issue was
[11:50:43] <_nickel> clicking the label doesn't select the radio
[11:50:49] <_nickel> I *think*
[11:51:13] <_nickel> which, from the comments appears to be partially solved save for when span's are in the label
[11:51:15] <eddiemonge> i think its clicking the label doesnt trigger click events attached to the actual radio button itself, but the select still works
[11:51:45] <eddiemonge> but without a test case there really is no way of knowing
[11:53:23] <toddparker> geseguin, we discussed that
[11:53:58] <_nickel> alright I'm going to look into it
[11:54:35] <gseguin> _nickel, eddiemonge: just tried https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1696#issuecomment-1343408 on iPad2 iOS4 and 5
[11:54:36] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #1696 on jquery-mobile, reported by badtoto (3m, 3w ago): radio button's onchange event
[11:54:39] <gseguin> it's working
[11:55:42] <eddiemonge> could you try https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1696#issuecomment-1357369
[11:55:43] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #1696 on jquery-mobile, reported by badtoto (3m, 3w ago): radio button's onchange event
[11:55:43] <gseguin> toddparker: yeah, I just wanted to confirm
[11:56:41] <toddparker> the issue is that you end up on a slippery slope - i fyou break out border, do you also break out just the bg
[11:56:42] <gseguin> eddiemonge: wodking on iOS4
[11:56:44] <toddparker> etc. etc.
[11:56:49] <toddparker> negating isn't too much work
[11:57:37] <gseguin> eddiemonge: working on iOS5
[11:57:44] <toddparker> i'd like to get someone to click thru in IE 7 and 9 to clean up anything obvious
[11:57:55] <toddparker> just noticed radio buttons pop out under the custom control
[11:57:58] <eddiemonge> gseguin: i would say its resolved then
[11:58:16] <gseguin> _nickel: if the test case is valid, the bug is fixed
[11:58:28] <_nickel> gseguin: the one submitted by monte?
[11:58:45] <gseguin> eddiemonge: I would come to the same conclusion
[11:59:04] <gseguin> _nickel: which is a dup of 1696, isn't it?
[11:59:19] <kinblas> hey guys, been out all morning, catching up with the email flood
[11:59:36] <eddiemonge> gseguin: i think they are different
[11:59:42] <_nickel> gseguin: they seem different to me
[12:00:09] <gseguin> I didn't look in detail, I just saw todd's comment
[12:00:24] <gseguin> alright then I'll close 1696
[12:00:34] <gseguin> thanks eddiemonge
[12:00:49] <_nickel> I can't reproduce 1335 in android
[12:01:15] <_nickel> 2.3 that is
[12:01:19] <_nickel> gseguin: do you have 2.2?
[12:02:08] <gseguin> let me see
[12:02:24] <gseguin> i do
[12:02:32] <_nickel> gseguin: http://jsbin.com/oduxir
[12:02:41] <_nickel> not sure but I think thats enough to repro
[12:03:08] <gseguin> is there a jsbin?
[12:03:27] <gseguin> ok
[12:03:55] * gseguin types faster than he can read
[12:03:57] <_nickel> gseguin: http://jsbin.com/oduxir/2/edit
[12:04:05] <toddparker> need help with this Q from remy (jsbin)
[12:04:06] <toddparker> @jquerymobile @scottjehl is the undefined thing in jsbin & jQM because it's reading the url? jsbin.com/osuwiv/edit#prâ€¦ "preview" is undefined?
[12:04:09] <_nickel> that one fires the click on the span just to be sure that works too
[12:04:16] <toddparker> and therefore, if jQM is in an iframe, should it read iframe source url instead of window.top.location?
[12:04:47] <toddparker> dunno i you've seen this issue
[12:04:54] <_nickel> toddparker: nope
[12:04:58] <_nickel> is it an actual issue?
[12:06:24] <toddparker> never mid, scott is on it
[12:06:28] <gseguin> _nickel: what am I suppose to see or not to see ?
[12:06:35] <toddparker> yeah, you see "undefined" instead of a jQM page
[12:06:52] <gseguin> toddparker: only in preview mode
[12:06:54] <_nickel> gseguin: the second one should be an alert with "foo"
[12:07:01] <_nickel> automatically
[12:07:10] <_nickel> the first revision requires a touch/click to get the alert
[12:07:26] <_nickel> in both cases you should get an alert
[12:07:27] <gseguin> _nickel: no alert onload of /2
[12:07:33] <_nickel> hrm
[12:07:52] <_nickel> whatabout when you hit it with your finger on the first one?
[12:07:55] <gseguin> _nickel: just when taping the radio
[12:08:07] <_nickel> hmm
[12:08:09] <_nickel> that sucks
[12:08:23] <_nickel> now I need to find a 2.2 device lol
[12:32:02] <toddparker> i'm back internet outage

[13:25:10] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery-mobile by jblas (1d, 13h ago): Fix for issue 2406 - Navigation from one page back to multi-page template- Make sure that our hashchange resolves non-path hashes against the documentBase. This prevents the resulting changePath() call from incorrectly resolving against the URL for the current active (external) page.- Fixed a problem in the push-state code. A hashchange event is *NOT* fired when naviga
[13:25:10] <socialhapy> n internal page. This makes sense when you think about it since hashchange is only ever fired when the hash of the current document url changes, not when the document url itself changes. The fix was to make sure that the pushstate hashchange callback always sets a state object, even on embedded page URLs. This allows the hashchange callback to be triggered from within onPopState().

[13:29:06] <_nickel> bizarre timing
[13:29:22] <kinblas> _nickel: check it ... the URL displayed is correct
[13:29:24] <kinblas> the page isn't
[13:29:40] <_nickel> I just meant the bug report lol
[13:29:43] <_nickel> crazy

[13:30:48] <_nickel> err
[13:30:50] <_nickel> not the active page
[13:30:55] <_nickel> but the original page
[13:31:25] * kinblas wonders if he can lose those 50 lines of backwards compatible args to changePage() now that we're about to ship
[13:35:04] <_nickel> kinblas: line 667 navigation
[13:35:26] <_nickel> $.mobile.firstPage
[13:36:14] <kinblas> _nickel: it's the pop-state code that's calling hashChange with the first page state
[13:36:38] <_nickel> thats not good
[13:42:32] <kinblas> _nickel: so explain to me this timer in onPopState()?
[13:42:41] <_nickel> kinblas: quickfix
[13:42:43] <kinblas> What's happening is this
[13:42:56] <_nickel> thats the thing we needed to move to an event
[13:43:08] <kinblas> popState is happening, it's blocking the hashChange handler, but *NOT* the popState hashChange handler
[13:43:39] <kinblas> so when the popState hashchange handler gets called
[13:43:50] <kinblas> the URL in the location has *NO* hash
[13:44:03] <kinblas> because it's the replacestate version of the URL
[13:44:30] <_nickel> should we be binding to hash change on those popstates and returning false ?
[13:44:32] <kinblas> so it replaces the current locaiton with a bogus /test/#
[13:44:41] <_nickel> I guess it would still come to late?
[13:44:46] <_nickel> hmm
[13:44:51] <_nickel> the binding that is
[13:45:28] <_nickel> kinblas: probably something to do with vestigial self.hashchangeFired up top there
[13:46:12] <_nickel> so we need a "jqm please don't handle this hash change"
[13:46:27] <_nickel> not just the next one
[13:47:49] <_nickel> $.mobile.hashListeningEnabled I guess
[13:47:56] <_nickel> though I don't thats what it was meant for :D
[13:49:56] <kinblas> _nickel: I guess what I'm wondering is the popstate handler should look at that ignore flag too?
[13:50:56] <kinblas> _nickel: also
[13:51:16] <kinblas> the state object's hash
[13:51:23] <kinblas> is initialized to location.hash if it exists
[13:51:25] <kinblas> but if it doesn't
[13:51:35] <kinblas> it initializes to the application document's path
[13:51:55] * kinblas tries ignoring the hashchange call when ignore is set
[13:52:26] <_nickel> kinblas: I'm a bit confused by your explanation "popState is happening, it's blocking the hashChange handler, but *NOT* the popState hashChange handler"
[13:53:12] <kinblas> _nickel: the navigation.js file has a hashchange binding
[13:53:29] <kinblas> the popState callback sets the ignore flag to disable that callback binding
[13:53:42] <kinblas> the pushstate code *ALSO* binds to hashchange
[13:53:55] <_nickel> right
[13:54:05] <kinblas> the hashchange callback in the pushstate code re-writes the URL to be a full path
[13:54:06] <_nickel> so we need to disable both
[13:54:08] <kinblas> right
[13:54:24] <_nickel> popState hashChange handler
[13:54:39] <_nickel> I wasn't sure if that meant the onHashChange method
[13:54:43] <_nickel> or the call to _hashChangeHandler
[13:55:27] <kinblas> oh sorry
[13:55:36] <kinblas> I meant we also need to disable onHashChange
[13:58:02] <_nickel> kinblas: I think using ignoreNextHashChange would work perfect unfortunately the nav binding fires first and resets it to false :(
[13:58:39] <kinblas> doh
[13:58:51] <kinblas> well we can set our own pushstate ignore hashchange flag
[14:01:47] <_nickel> yah
[14:02:02] <_nickel> thats what I think the self.hashChangeFired was/is for
[14:02:02] <_nickel> :D
[14:02:10] <_nickel> seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle
[14:02:37] <_nickel> or similar
[14:05:32] <kinblas> _nickel: yeah self.hashChangeFired only gets set to true and never cleared
[14:05:43] <_nickel> kinblas: lol
[14:05:46] <_nickel> leftovers
[14:06:23] <_nickel> kinblas: setting an aribitrary "don't do this" flag seems to work nicely
[14:06:33] <_nickel> self.foo in my case :D
[14:07:35] <kinblas> _nickel: ok so you got this bug?
[14:07:43] <_nickel> kinblas: yassir
[14:07:47] * kinblas moves on
[14:08:00] <kinblas> scottjehl been on today?
[14:08:06] <_nickel> not that I've seen
[14:08:15] <_nickel> kinblas: I pinged you on the click handler issue
[14:08:16] <kinblas> I finally wrote that tiny php script for returning json or html for our examples
[14:08:29] <kinblas> _nickel: uh which issue?
[14:08:49] <_nickel> kinblas: trying to find it gimme a sec
[14:08:50] * kinblas notes he went from coming in late .. straight into a meeting
[14:09:16] <kinblas> _nickel: 1696?
[14:10:02] <_nickel> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2438
[14:10:02] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #2438 on jquery-mobile, reported by sinewave42 (10h, 51m ago): Documentation - middle clicking link does not open target in new tab
[14:10:26] <kinblas> _nickel: oh that one
[14:11:19] <kinblas> _nickel: I think there's a bit more to it
[14:11:47] <kinblas> we need to also do that in the vclick handler ... but we need to modify the vmouse plugin so that if it is generated via  touch event that it set the which=1
[14:14:05] <gseguin> toddmparker, toddparker: what do you think of http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/tests/test_1899.html
[14:17:17] <toddparker> hey, hey
[14:17:26] <toddparker> with the boxes, i prefer G over F
[14:17:39] <toddparker> for sure
[14:17:58] <gseguin> oops didn't do anything for F
[14:18:48] <gseguin> so I'm using ui-btn-up-%%theme%% on collapsible content
[14:19:02] <gseguin> and then do the border work in the collapsible.css
[14:19:24] <gseguin> toddparker: ^^^
[14:19:37] <toddparker> F and G were a comparison of the corner behavior, no?
[14:19:37] <toddparker> either of
[14:19:37] <toddparker> or
[14:19:38] <gseguin> this way I don't touch the theme.css
[14:19:57] <gseguin> I haven't worked on F
[14:20:17] <gseguin> F is a single collapsible
[14:20:26] <gseguin> it's got the shadow thing
[14:20:40] <gseguin> I can take care of it if you ok G
[14:20:41] <toddparker> so what's G
[14:20:47] <toddparker> an accordion of 1?
[14:20:52] <gseguin> yes
[14:20:56] <toddparker> ah
[14:21:07] <gseguin> so G behaves like E
[14:21:12] <toddparker> so that will look identical to G?
[14:21:22] <toddparker> F will look like G?
[14:21:27] <gseguin> plus the shadow yeah
[14:21:45] <gseguin> or not, as you want
[14:21:57] <gseguin> I find it a little inconsistent
[14:23:11] <toddparker> yeah, unless you put the shadow on the whole accordion container?
[14:23:34] <toddparker> so the only thing I don't like is how button-y the content looks
[14:25:05] <toddparker> what if we added a background-image:none
[14:25:05] <toddparker> rule to the content so you just get the flat bg color from the theme
[14:25:11] <gseguin> that's the only way I found to get the border matching
[14:25:20] <gseguin> yeah I could do that
[14:25:35] <toddparker> might be nice
[14:25:48] <toddparker> ui-collapsible-content ui-btn-up-a,
[14:25:52] <toddparker> ui-collapsible-content ui-btn-up-b,
[14:25:59] <toddparker> ui-collapsible-content ui-btn-up-d, etc
[14:26:13] <toddparker> { background-image:none }
[14:26:36] <toddparker> tho how to write that rule w/o needing to list all the themes?
[14:28:00] <gseguin> toddparker: reload
[14:28:43] <toddparker> i like!
[14:28:49] <gseguin> just putting it in .ui-collapsible works
[14:28:50] <toddparker> feels much cleanre
[14:28:54] <toddparker> ah, right
[14:29:05] <toddparker> wasn't sure about inheritance
[14:29:07] <toddparker> good
[14:29:18] <toddparker> digin' it
[14:29:21] <gseguin> alright!
[14:29:21] <toddparker> diggin'
[14:29:31] <toddparker> G looks TIGHT
[14:29:51] <gseguin> so you want the shadow thinggy around all of these?
[14:30:01] <toddparker> not sure, what do you think?
[14:30:02] <gseguin> or no shadow at all?
[14:30:21] <toddparker> might be cleaner w/o
[14:30:38] <gseguin> hmm, not sure either
[14:30:42] <toddparker> Closed, G looks a lot nicer than F
[14:30:50] <toddparker> so maybe w/o
[14:30:56] <gseguin> alright
[14:31:29] <gseguin> I'll ping you in a few to validate before pushing
[14:31:34] <toddparker> ok
[14:32:03] <toddparker> what do you think about getting rid of the white button with shadow?
[14:32:10] <toddparker> just having a disc with icon?
[14:32:33] <gseguin> just white on gray ?
[14:32:41] <gseguin> no outter circle?
[14:32:59] <toddparker> ya
[14:33:31] <gseguin> might look less busy
[14:33:44] <toddparker> yeah
[14:33:55] <gseguin> I feel like it's catching my eye rather than the title of the section
[14:34:03] <gseguin> I'll try that too
[14:34:08] <toddparker> if you just remove these classes:
[14:34:13] <toddparker> ui-shadow
[14:34:17] <toddparker> ui-btn-down-d
[14:34:18] <toddparker> ui-btn-up-d
[14:34:32] <toddparker> from the current markup, it looks clean as a whistle
[14:35:04] <_nickel> kinblas: I'll take a look
[14:35:07] <toddparker> my issue is that the buttons looks more clutter-y and like a split button
[14:35:18] <toddparker> yeah, it's distracting
[14:36:06] <kinblas> toddparker: so for that sample that scottjehl did right before we ship
[14:36:13] <kinblas> shipped b3
[14:36:14] <toddparker> yep
[14:36:22] <toddparker> ^^ kinblas
[14:36:26] <kinblas> toddparker: he left the json in-memory
[14:36:33] <kinblas> I have a script that externalizes everything
[14:36:45] <kinblas> json when XHR is used, HTML when called directly
[14:36:49] <toddparker> so the JSON is a separate file?
[14:36:53] <kinblas> ya mon
[14:37:00] <toddparker> cool beans, me likey
[14:37:07] <toddparker> trying to get scott in here
[14:37:13] <kinblas> toddparker: do we want to leave the hybrid in-memory +  external html sample?
[14:37:25] <kinblas> or do we want to replace it with one that really calls a php script example?
[14:38:12] <toddparker> i think the new version is better
[14:38:31] <toddparker> we should add some explanation of the differences on that branch page
[14:38:39] <toddparker> i always get confused about what is what
[14:40:26] <kinblas> toddparker: sorry, which new version?
[14:40:41] <toddparker> your new version mentioned bove
[14:41:51] <toddparker> externalized everything
[15:26:46] <_nickel> kinblas: I've got a fix in to prevent the locally bound hashchange
[15:27:11] <_nickel> kinblas: I'm thinking we'll want to move that to namespaced events at some point
[15:27:15] <_nickel> where we can unbind and rebind
[15:27:20] <_nickel> but the rebind seems tough
[15:29:13] <kinblas> _nickel: not sure I follow. Why the need to unbind/re-bind?
[15:29:17] <kinblas> instead of off/on switch
[15:29:44] <_nickel> kinblas: on off switchs need to be managed on a per switch basis
[15:29:55] <_nickel> best case scenario you'll have them in the same method
[15:30:19] <_nickel> but we can blanket squash hashchange with an event namespace and then not worry about folks adding other handlers as long as they use the namespace
[15:30:35] <_nickel> though you could make the case that squashing would be a surprising behaviour
[15:31:47] <kinblas> not sure I follow
[15:31:52] <kinblas> _nickel: ^
[15:32:03] <_nickel> kinblas: well in this case we're now managing two flags
[15:32:22] <_nickel> because we want to prevent two bound functions from executing
[15:32:23] <kinblas> yeah, but the latter one, is private to that push-state plugin
[15:32:44] <_nickel> true
[15:33:23] <_nickel> its the management
[15:33:29] <_nickel> juggling flags
[15:33:39] <_nickel> makes the code much harder to reason about
[15:34:08] <_nickel> instead of just saying "nothing under this event.namespace should fire"
[15:34:32] <_nickel> which is what we want in this case
[15:34:49] <_nickel> we're trying to say "stop all other hashchange handling done by jqm"
[15:34:58] <_nickel> instead we're twiddling bits
[15:35:05] <_nickel> which is not directly related to the action at hand
[15:35:10] <_nickel> harder to reason about
[15:53:14] <gseguin> toddparker: reload, F is fixed
