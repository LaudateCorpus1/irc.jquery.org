[08:24:16] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:35:52] <toddparker> good morning gseguin
[08:38:30] <gseguin> I was looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1415
[08:38:46] <gseguin> not sure this is an issue anymore
[08:58:58] <StevenBlack> =======
[08:59:14] <StevenBlack> Here's my plan for Issues 1554 and 1555: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/_%28TempPage%29-Feature-Spec:-$.mobile.removePage%28%29
[08:59:23] <StevenBlack> In short: three separate pulls.
[09:01:54] <gseguin> Is there an opera mobile emulator for version 10.0 ?
[10:17:41] <todd_> gseguin - http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/mobile/
[10:17:56] <todd_> or you want the older version?
[10:19:38] <todd_> stevenblack - that plan looks good to me
[10:29:58] <gseguin> todd_: yeah I want the older version
[10:30:04] <gseguin> this is version 11.0
[10:30:42] <gseguin> I'd like 10.0 since there is an issue that I was looking at that is reported on that version
[11:23:47] <toddparker> gotcha
[11:26:06] <toddparker> all versions link to latest
[11:27:16] <eddiemonge> ?
[11:48:42] <kinblas> toddparker: fyi, I'm a bit distracted by a 45 page document I need to review by EOD
[11:48:45] * kinblas sighs
[11:48:57] * kinblas turns to page 5
[11:58:32] <kinblas> toddparker: regarding https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1640#issuecomment-1236437
[11:58:37] <kinblas> the patch in question:
[11:58:54] <kinblas> isn't necessarily the right thing to do in all cases
[11:58:55] <kinblas> https://github.com/shanegenschaw/jquery-mobile/commit/a0d7fb03ae4a1d979af1b58476f7ae8aa3bafd54
[11:59:50] <kinblas> the path stuff I have planned should fix this problem
[12:00:19] <kinblas> even in the cases where the page the href came from is from a different domain
[12:00:27] <kinblas> (PhoneGap)
[12:42:29] <toddparker> ok, i can tell him no thanks
[12:44:56] <toddparker> i hate reading big docs. blech
[12:45:01] <toddparker> code is more fun
[12:48:37] <eddiemonge> anyone know who closed: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/637#comment_1234215
[12:58:16] <toddparker> guessing the last guy that commented. i re-opended eddiemonge
[12:58:38] <toddparker> does does this pull look? Allow checkboxes and radio buttons to be selected with the keyboard
[12:58:43] <toddparker> https://github.com/shanag/jquery-mobile/commit/4ca2fc5287f731f84c9cda7e2503bcadffe6cc71
[12:59:41] <kinblas> eddiemonge: have you tried a really basic test case with < input type="searc" > in it and no jqm?
[12:59:51] <kinblas> type="search" I meant
[13:00:40] <eddiemonge> i dont have an android anymore but at the time i thought it had gotten fixed or i had a fix for it but i dont remember anymore
[13:01:48] <eddiemonge> toddparker: 61 and 62 or that should not be changed
[13:01:57] <eddiemonge> s/or/of/
[13:02:55] <toddparker> eddiemonge - can you comment?
[13:03:51] <eddiemonge> .attr('checked') (in 1.6 not sure about 1.6.1) will only return the initial value of the input, not the current value.
[13:04:20] <kinblas> eddiemonge: the swype problem still exists. I see it on my Droid 2 (Android 2.2)
[13:04:38] <eddiemonge> pretty much the same for the code thats being added. it should be using .prop instead of .attr
[13:13:45] <gseguin> kinblas: there is pull request for you to review: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1701
[13:15:25] <kinblas> gseguin: I'd like to get scott to review that since you are modifying the CSS
[13:15:45] <kinblas> perhaps todd can review too
[13:16:04] <gseguin> no css in that changeset
[13:16:31] <gseguin> this is the nested view fix we've been talking about
[13:16:43] <gseguin> s/view/list view/
[13:25:39] <gseguin> kinblas: where you looking at the wrong pull request?
[13:26:18] <kinblas> hmmm, I thought you were talking about this one:
[13:26:20] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1338
[13:26:34] <kinblas> not sure how I got there from an email I saw from you (from github)
[13:27:05] <gseguin> yeah different one, I just submitted it
[13:27:25] <eddiemonge> toddparker: can you assign that ticket to me and ill clean it up?
[13:30:24] <kinblas> gseguin: I need a couple of hours, I'm trying to plow through something I need to finish by end of day today
[13:30:34] <kinblas> sorry
[13:30:35] <kinblas> :-(
[13:30:37] <gseguin> sure
[13:30:53] <gseguin> no problem, just wanted to let you know it's out there
[13:31:00] <kinblas> ok, noted it
[13:36:14] <gseguin> todd_:  can you check out pull req: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1338 ?
[13:53:53] <_nickel> gseguin: are the three different commits named that same thing for any reason?
[13:53:59] <_nickel> gseguin: in the pull request that is
[13:58:15] <toddparker> wondering the same thing
[13:58:43] <toddparker> the js bin version looks good tho!
[13:59:01] <toddparker> i asked scott j to look at this
[14:13:29] <gseguin> _nickel: sorry for the different commits, I realized I could do less changes and obtain the same resul
[14:13:41] <gseguin> and then I committed the unit tests
[14:13:42] <_nickel> gseguin: oh no, more commits is good
[14:13:53] <gseguin> oh ok
[14:14:04] <_nickel> gseguin: they look nicely seperated, I'm just wondering about the commit messages
[14:14:24] <gseguin> oh yeah, that's lazyness :-/
[14:14:47] <_nickel> fair enough :D
[14:16:36] <gseguin> I have meeting, I should be back shortly
[15:10:53] <gseguin> kinblas: navigation.js line 399 shouldn't it be a comma instead of a semi-colon
[15:10:54] <gseguin> ?
[15:12:35] <kinblas> ah there it is .. thanks ... _nickel had mentioned it to me earlier
[15:12:39] <kinblas> but I didn't recall where
[15:12:43] <_nickel> kinblas: ?
[15:12:45] <kinblas> fixing it
[15:12:48] <kinblas> the semi-colon
[15:12:52] <_nickel> :D
[15:13:06] <_nickel> adding that jslint pre commit hooks to my todo list
[15:13:09] <_nickel> we _really_ need that
[15:13:11] <_nickel> well
[15:13:18] <_nickel> you guys do since js2-mode in emacs does it for me :D
[15:15:35] <kinblas> heh
[15:16:00] <kinblas> I was manually jslinting a while back and fixing stuff
[15:16:08] <kinblas> but the dang move your var declarations to the top
[15:16:11] <kinblas> warnings get in the way
[15:16:15] <kinblas> of the real errors
[15:18:34] <eddiemonge> jshint is better
[15:20:52] <gseguin> how would you go about adding a pre-commit hook to run jshint on the file ?
[15:23:59] <eddiemonge> it would be more of a checklist item
[15:40:32] <gseguin> _nickel: any comments on that pull request?
[15:41:16] <_nickel> gseguin: I would have to take a deeper look at the issue but the jsbin seems to suggest its working
[15:41:18] <_nickel> let me take a lok
[15:41:20] <_nickel> *look
[15:41:32] <gseguin> ok
[15:42:37] <_nickel> gseguin: ample git hooks are in /your/project/dir/.git/hooks/ directory and they're just +x scripts
[15:42:45] <_nickel> *sample git hooks :P
[15:43:08] <_nickel> eddiemonge: sounded that way from the disqus guys presentation at jqcon
[15:43:12] <_nickel> eddiemonge: good presentation anyway
[15:43:14] <gseguin> yeah but how do you execute jshint.js ?
[15:43:26] <_nickel> I enjoy a bit of "you're doing it wrong" every once in a while, its a fast way to learn
[15:43:27] <gseguin> with rhino, phantomjs or node?
[15:44:27] <_nickel> gseguin: I think node is the preferred solution for the author
[15:44:36] <eddiemonge> it could be automated but i think its a on-your-own-computer type of thing
[15:45:14] <_nickel> eddiemonge: gseguin: we can do it as part of our CI build, but that means its commited
[15:45:37] <eddiemonge> CI build?
[15:45:44] <_nickel> continue integration
[15:45:55] <_nickel> continuous integration
[15:46:58] <_nickel> by rights we should anyway since there's might be gap between when someone gets commit access, and of course we now have the "merge button"
[15:47:14] <_nickel> but for the most part its better to have that happen before anyone commits
[15:47:31] <_nickel> then we don't have extra commits just for jshint warnings etc
[15:48:10] <eddiemonge> so then it should be part of the build/test phase
[15:48:21] <eddiemonge> but i dont know how to block someone from committing without it running
[15:48:25] <eddiemonge> oh wait, maybe i do
[15:48:46] <eddiemonge> but it still should be part of the build anyway
[15:49:00] <gseguin> kinblas: is it possible with the new navigation code to load a page that's already in the document and pass it arguments through the url?
[15:49:34] <_nickel> eddiemonge: pre-commit hook :D
[15:50:10] <eddiemonge> _nickel: i forgot precommit hooks are part of git and can be transferred to anyone.
[15:50:13] <_nickel> gseguin: first question from the pull request - quicksmode sites opera as requiring a special css property http://www.quirksmode.org/css/textoverflow.html
[15:50:22] <eddiemonge> only thing im afraid of is newer people might not know how to deal with that
[15:50:25] <_nickel> eddiemonge: they don't come with the repo though
[15:50:34] <_nickel> eddiemonge: well you can add them
[15:50:39] <_nickel> and just tell people to symlink
[15:50:56] <_nickel> but it won't be there upon the initial clone
[15:51:15] <eddiemonge> you sure?
[15:51:18] <_nickel> yes
[15:51:26] <_nickel> .git isn't included in the repo for a reason
[15:51:40] <_nickel> it would explode
[15:51:54] <_nickel> I think global commit hooks were on the roadmap
[15:51:59] <gseguin> I didn't touch the text-overflow, just the display
[15:52:25] <eddiemonge> who gave that disqus talk? was it anton?
[15:52:58] <_nickel> yes
[15:53:00] <_nickel> thats his name
[15:53:04] <_nickel> I liked the talk
[15:53:06] <_nickel> alot
[15:53:08] <eddiemonge> ill ask him
[15:53:21] <_nickel> eddiemonge: gseguin: https://gist.github.com/3ab8f92dbe40dc38062c
[15:53:41] <_nickel> checks for console / alert
[15:53:57] <gseguin> _nickel: that's a good start
[15:54:06] <gseguin> add to that: debugger
[15:54:39] <_nickel> gseguin: hmm interesting
[15:54:56] <kinblas> gseguin: you can probably add data to the options object you pass in, but the URL needs to remain the same so we can find it
[15:54:57] <kinblas> in the DOM
[15:54:59] <_nickel> toddparker: kinblas: I think we use text-overlow in a couple places, doees that work on opera mobile / mini?
[15:55:35] <gseguin> kinblas: so you can't deep link?
[15:55:36] <_nickel> toddparker: kinblas: according to quirksmode opera desktop requires a special css attr -o-text-overflow
[15:56:48] <_nickel> gseguin: test looks great btw
[15:57:06] * _nickel cheers for testing!
[15:57:16] <kinblas> gseguin: this would be a case where you would need to update the data-url on the element via some hook we give
[15:57:29] <kinblas> _nickel: Not sure about opera mini, I doubt it
[15:57:34] <_nickel> gseguin: it might be fragile but at least we know that problem won't crop up again
[15:59:50] <gseguin> kinblas: thanks, I'll investigate
[16:00:25] <kinblas> gseguin: I suppose you are wanting to change the URL just for the hash right?
[16:00:26] <_nickel> kinblas: if you see todd ping him on that its CSS
[16:00:52] <kinblas> _nickel: will do but I think that's something we can test real quick with a very basic sample
[16:00:55] <kinblas> if you want final word
[16:01:03] <gseguin> _nickel: thanks, I hate haveing to investigate the same bug twice
[16:01:42] <kinblas> One of the things I was thinking about were hooks for encode/decode URLs
[16:02:16] <kinblas> I would pass in an object with the document base, the page base, and the URL we are trying to load, as well as an entry in the object for what the hash would be set to
[16:02:20] <gseguin> kinblas: that would be very helpfull for us
[16:02:25] <kinblas> that way folks could encode it themselves
[16:02:29] <kinblas> and all we do is slam it in
[16:02:44] <kinblas> but you would have to be able to decode it on the other end when we process a hash change
[16:03:37] <gseguin> yep and that should be fine
[16:03:59] <eddiemonge> _nickel: hmm. looks like you are right
[16:04:35] * kinblas is bummed about today being a somewhat non-jqm day
[16:05:45] <_nickel> kinblas: :D
[16:06:13] <kinblas> _nickel: I know ... cry me a river right?
[16:07:02] <_nickel> _nickel: haha I am jealous of your job lol
[16:20:15] <_nickel> gseguin: I would ping Todd about the text-overflow thing
[16:21:11] <gseguin> _nickel: will do
[16:21:35] <gseguin> but I didn't change the text-overflow
[16:21:38] <gseguin> just the display
[16:21:50] <gseguin> changed it from inline-block to block
[16:22:17] <gseguin> that prevents the ui-btn-text from bleeding outside of its container
[16:29:27] <kinblas> gseguin: wouldn't overflow:hidden do that too?
[16:29:53] <kinblas> the change in the display  type is why I want scott and todd to look at it
[16:30:10] <kinblas> I'm not sure what the implications are for the use cases they considered when they chose inline-block
[16:31:25] <gseguin> kinblas: for some reasons it didn't
[16:31:50] <gseguin> yeah no problem, I'll try to catch either of them
[16:32:32] <gseguin> I was catching up with my twitter stream and saw Scott mentioning a jQM / PhoneGap meeting
[16:32:42] <gseguin> when is that, what is it about?
[16:35:04] * kinblas shrugs -- out of the loop
[16:37:29] <_nickel> gseguin: yap I would just make sure he knows about it either way and its nearly certain I'll forget
[16:37:43] <_nickel> gseguin: I just figured it would be easier for you since that pull request has to be merged
[16:37:46] <_nickel> actually I'll just comment
[16:37:49] * _nickel is silly
[16:37:58] <gseguin> :)
[17:06:10] <gseguin> kinblas: back to my navigation question
[17:06:38] <kinblas> uh huh
[17:06:52] <gseguin> we have links like "#jive-document?id=1234"
[17:07:02] <kinblas> mind you I haven't gotten to implementing theencode/decode stuff
[17:07:04] <kinblas> :-)
[17:07:10] <kinblas> uh huh
[17:07:20] <gseguin> oh ok, I thought it was in
[17:07:31] <kinblas> no not yet
[17:07:42] <gseguin> ok, ok
[17:07:46] <kinblas> the progression is: Refactor, fix what's there, insert hooks
[17:07:58] <kinblas> we're at the fix what's there stage :-)
[17:08:00] <gseguin> well good, let's make sure our use case gets covered
[17:08:25] <kinblas> the reason we need to fix what's there is because some folks are blocked by some of the path bustages that were introduced after 1.0a4.1
[17:08:38] <kinblas> once they are unblocked we can start adding the cool/new stuff
[17:08:41] <gseguin> gotcha
[17:08:43] <kinblas> aka the jive hooks
[17:09:06] <gseguin> so you're already aware of what we're trying to do
[17:09:55] <gseguin> it's week 3 for me I'm not sure who knows what, what I'm sure is that there are plenty of things I don't know
[17:10:13] <kinblas> gseguin: Yeah I'm aware
[17:10:21] <kinblas> don't worry, we'll make it happen
[17:10:35] <gseguin> great!
[17:11:09] <gseguin> thanks, let me know if you need help with that
[17:12:13] <gseguin> kinblas: when do you foresee these changes landing?
[17:12:37] <gseguin> what kind of time frame, roughly?
[17:12:45] <kinblas> hopefully the next week or so
[17:13:03] <gseguin> so it'll make it to b1
[17:13:04] <kinblas> of course administratia keeps getting in the way
[17:13:29] <kinblas> oooh, that I'm not sure about ... I thought they were saying beta 2
[17:13:36] <kinblas> but I'll try
[17:14:13] <gseguin> oh so that means b1 is for next week or so
[17:14:42] <gseguin> cool well no rush and let me know if I can help
[17:15:39] <kinblas> ok
[20:08:37] <StevenBlack> I just landed $.mobile.removePage(), with tests.  ?docs#m1713

[20:12:39] <StevenBlack> Question: what's preferrable for ?docs#m1555 and ?docs#m1556.  Should I branch off my "removePage" branch?  I'm guessing it's preferable for this to be merged and THEN I can make feature branches from HEAD, avoiding 2nd generation branches on the busy Navigation.js package.
