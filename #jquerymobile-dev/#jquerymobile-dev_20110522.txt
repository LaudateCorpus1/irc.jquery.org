[07:29:13] <StevenBlack> Good morning!
[07:30:37] <StevenBlack> Question: what's the recommended way for developers to change the defaults on the page widget, application-wide.  Since calling the page widget is typically in jQuery Mobile mainline code, this is a problem.
[07:31:19] <StevenBlack> The best I could come up with is something like...
[07:31:23] <StevenBlack> $.mobile.page.prototype.option( { addBackBtn: true } );
[07:31:28] <StevenBlack> or
[07:31:48] <StevenBlack> $.mobile.page.prototype.options.addBackbutton= true;
