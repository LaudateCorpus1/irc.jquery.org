[03:03:56] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Hi, Gabriel.
[03:05:40] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: I was told by Hyunsook that Tizen widgets' codes were committed on jqm GH.
[03:06:18] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Should you have additional requests, pls let us know. :)
[03:07:04] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: And Kangsik and Hyunsook will make documents regarding the widgets.
[03:08:58] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: so do you have any forms or XML specifications about the documents, pls email me and them.
[03:16:37] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: then we'll make the documents with the XML forms which you send us. :)
[03:17:31] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: I think you aren't here now... and I'll go home in a few minutes.
[03:19:07] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: see you later~
[03:33:35] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15hikalkan opened issue #5431: Solution to flicker problem in jQuery mobile page transitions!  02http://git.io/bQ6v7Q
[05:08:01] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: 
[05:15:19] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[07:05:35] <toddmparker> morning
[07:06:37] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi and arschmitz 
[07:06:46] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker
[07:06:50] <toddmparker> that flicker on android issue is interesting
[07:06:58] <toddmparker> definitely worth a look
[07:07:10] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[07:07:12] <toddmparker> feel like we should look at page transitions again in 1.4
[07:07:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker: zoom needs to be disabled for android for fixed toolbars to work
[07:07:28] <uGoMobi> yes, it makes sense to me after everything I look into for panels
[07:07:30] <arschmitz> not sure about other issues
[07:07:41] <toddmparker> arschmitz: sure, i don't think he understood why that was there
[07:07:51] <toddmparker> but i wonder if we can finesse the sequence of things
[07:08:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah or at least not do it for non fixed toolbars maybe
[07:08:22] <toddmparker> could we make sure zoom is re-enables before we transition
[07:08:36] <toddmparker> arschmitz: for sure
[07:08:46] <uGoMobi> I agree.. we still have the flicker with PhoneGap issue with its 100 comments too
[07:08:50] <toddmparker> think we only disable if android and fixed toolbars anyway
[07:09:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: sheesh, yeah
[07:09:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: if we did it would cause the toolbars to "snap" into place if you were scrolled at all 
[07:09:37] <toddmparker> that's probably true. hmm
[07:09:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: we disable zoom for all things fixed currently because they get really weird when you zoom
[07:09:50] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[07:10:00] <arschmitz> like if you zoom with fixed toolbars on ios things get real wonky
[07:10:06] <uGoMobi> I noticed with panels that sequence and timing of applying styles is so important when it comes to preventing flicker
[07:10:07] <toddmparker> makes sense. if you zoom a page, the fixed toolbar can take over
[07:10:20] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: right. think you now have the zen
[07:10:25] <arschmitz> the toolbars zoom too and scroll at a different rate then the page
[07:10:33] <uGoMobi> I sure do :)
[07:11:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: it is something to look into fir timing for sure though and maybe re think for non fixed toolbars
[07:12:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe you can work some magic lol
[07:13:09] <uGoMobi> I def want to look into it
[07:13:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nice
[07:13:29] <uGoMobi> shoudn't wait too long with that because now everything is still fresh in mind
[07:13:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: about panels... I think we need to wrap the panel contents in a div
[07:13:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for sure
[07:14:10] <uGoMobi> our scrollintoview logic is incorrect
[07:14:24] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i thought we were wrapping the panels
[07:14:28] <uGoMobi> it compares height of the panel to screen height
[07:14:38] <toddmparker> did you change that to make sure the header footer stayed fixed?
[07:14:51] <uGoMobi> I dunno
[07:14:58] <toddmparker> hmmm
[07:15:04] <uGoMobi> but the element height is useless
[07:15:40] <toddmparker> does scrollintoview scroll you up if the panels aren't fixed and you're scrolled down
[07:15:43] <uGoMobi> because when it it position absolute the height is 100% of document height = always greater than screen height
[07:16:18] <uGoMobi> unless you have short page
[07:16:25] <uGoMobi> but then you dont need to scroll anyway
[07:17:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that is the idea of the function but it doesn't work
[07:17:18] <uGoMobi> when we wrap the panel contents in a div
[07:17:27] <uGoMobi> we can use the height of that
[07:18:12] <uGoMobi> and that actually tells you the height of what is in the panel
[07:26:24] <Wilto> Whassup, jQM.
[07:27:28] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: gotcha
[07:28:22] <toddmparker> we fought wrapping and ended up doing that in the refactor so if you need to do that and adjust the logic for the scrollintoview, go for it
[07:29:25] <Wilto> johnbender: Iâ€™m un-calling dibs on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5428, provided youâ€™ve got some time to get to it today.
[07:29:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: saw about someone donating some wwindows phones thats pretty awesome
[07:33:42] <toddmparker> yeah, are you on basecamp yet? if not, i'll add you
[07:33:56] <arschmitz> toddmparker: nope
[07:35:38] <toddmparker> you are now :)

[07:39:06] <Wilto> â€¦For testing purposes. Naturally.
[07:39:14] <arschmitz> Iv never even used any windows phone lol

[07:40:33] <arschmitz> apparently lol
[07:50:31] <gseguin> mornin' all!
[07:53:51] <arschmitz> morning gseguin
[08:29:35] <toddmparker> hey gseguin|away 
[08:29:44] <toddmparker> hey gseguin
[08:52:23] <johnbender> Wilto: is that the namespacing bit?
[09:03:10] <Wilto> johnbender: Yeah. Got pulled onto client stuff; I might not have time if you wanna sneak it into 1.3.
[09:03:19] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm doing it right now
[09:03:23] <johnbender> shouldn't take too long :)
[09:03:24] <Wilto> Badass.
[09:03:38] <Wilto> Thanks man. Gotta scramble on something, at least until this afternoon.
[09:05:34] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: how goes the battle?
[09:07:14] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: fine, not a battle anymore :)
[09:07:45] <Wilto> His foes have been vanquished.

[12:41:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://gist.github.com/4505597
[12:42:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why do I get the feeling this has been done before.
[12:42:51] <_|Nix|_> ?
[12:43:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmmm
[12:43:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: where did that come from
[12:43:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wrote it by hand.
[12:43:41] <arschmitz> oh
[12:43:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wanted to see if I could deal with arbitrary HTML ...
[12:44:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... not just the small bits in our code.
[12:44:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ ahh gotcha
[12:44:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Seems pretty systematic.
[12:44:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[12:45:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Small issues like how do we represent attributes that are present but have no value? I figured attrName: true ...
[12:45:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: AFAIK the spec says that attrName="true" is the same as attrName.
[12:45:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah that makes sense
[12:45:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes that is correct
[12:46:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not sure how much all that mention of "children" adds to the code weight.
[12:46:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We could shorten it to c: []
[12:46:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah children isnt something i dealt with in my testing
[12:47:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but that might be cryptic.
[12:47:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... OTOH, it resembles HTML so much that people might get it pretty fast.
[12:47:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: shorten to child at least
[12:47:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah super readable
[12:47:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, there could be multiple.
[12:48:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... anyway, I gotta go for a bit, but I'm stoked to start cranking on the actual function and do some perf testing.
[12:48:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes but no matter how many they are still a child lol
[12:48:34] <arschmitz> and its 3 letters shorter ha ha
[12:48:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess it's the "child" DOM tree.
[12:48:38] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:48:44] <arschmitz> ok _|Nix|_: later
[12:49:47] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: look familiar? http://mg.to/2006/03/30/dom-creation-good-bad-and-ugly
[12:51:01] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: thats exactly what we have been talking about
[12:51:14] <DaveMethvin> This was actually an outgrowth of the very FIRST jquery plugin: http://blog.jquery.com/2006/01/25/first-jquery-plugin/

[14:38:54] <johnbender> Wilto: jlembeck: I'm getting a bit jaded after 2+ years of working on this project
[14:39:00] <johnbender> :)
[14:39:18] <Wilto> Nobody could blame you there.
[14:39:20] <jlembeck> I saw your comments on the web winning the other night
[14:39:26] <Wilto> Plus side, at least itâ€™s going in the right direction.
[14:39:34] <jlembeck> I laughed
[14:39:42] <johnbender> Wilto: yah it definitely is, but this "Web winning" thing is sort of silly imo
[14:39:56] <johnbender> at the very bottom of it all
[14:40:14] <johnbender> is the reality that we're trying to do things with a format and tool set that it was not originally intended for
[14:40:16] <Wilto> I dunno from winning or losing, but I know I can access like all documented information ever while Iâ€™m sitting on the train, and thatâ€™s good enough to keep me building crud.
[14:40:43] <johnbender> Wilto: for documents and even semi dynamic documents it's an _amazing_ tool
[14:40:48] <johnbender> there is no disputing that
[14:41:05] <johnbender> Wilto: and I would point out that the vast majority of what you are trumpeting there has nothing to do with browsers or html at all
[14:41:13] <johnbender> but rather the internet infrastructure on which it's built
[14:41:16] <Wilto> Yeah, true.
[14:41:24] <johnbender> this app thing though
[14:41:39] <johnbender> the web is just bent out of shape when you try to build apps with it
[14:41:41] <johnbender> that might change
[14:41:45] <johnbender> but that's how it is now imo
[14:41:54] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, agreed. It sucks for that kinda stuff.
[14:42:24] <johnbender> jlembeck: the analogy that guy used in his article
[14:42:36] <johnbender> "you wouldn't expect a native facebook app on the desktop" 
[14:42:41] <johnbender> is so leaky
[14:42:42] <Wilto> Still. It might sound idealisticâ€”and I mean, you know what a wide-eyed optimist I amâ€”but weâ€™re picking the fights that stand to change how much it sucks.
[14:42:43] <johnbender> holy shit
[14:43:01] <johnbender> Wilto: there's nothing to say it can't get better
[14:43:18] <johnbender> but the web has the ten ton weight of backward compatibility on it's shoulders
[14:43:26] <Wilto> Oh, yeah. Just sayinâ€™, thatâ€™s what I keep tellinâ€™ myself to keep the jadedness to a managable level.
[14:43:26] <johnbender> and abstraction
[14:43:30] <johnbender> ah
[14:43:35] <johnbender> it's an honorable fight
[14:43:59] <johnbender> mobile apps !== desktop apps for a myriad of reasons
[14:44:03] <jlembeck> "weâ€™re picking the fights that stand to change how much it sucks."
[14:44:19] <johnbender> the UX expectations are completely changed with touch
[14:44:23] <johnbender> the bar is so much higher
[14:44:26] <jlembeck> You keep that up Wilto and you'll be leading marches for web standards
[14:44:29] <johnbender> desktop apps before the web were crap
[14:44:33] <johnbender> because you could get away with taht
[14:44:35] <Wilto> Youâ€™re tellinâ€™ me.
[14:44:46] <johnbender> the design revolution came to the web
[14:45:00] <johnbender> and then trickled back into desktop applications
[14:45:08] <johnbender> when mobile arried there was already an expectationi
[14:45:13] <johnbender> and iOS set the bar high
[14:45:16] <johnbender> UX is king
[14:45:52] <johnbender> and native UX might always be just a bit better than it will be on the web because of the obvious reasons
[14:46:11] <johnbender> </rant>
[14:46:19] <johnbender> this will be a blog post at some point
[14:52:10] <Wilto> I mean, I never even use the web, me.
[14:52:42] <Wilto> I dictate all this stuff to you guys. Got a personal assistant named Chuck typing it up for me. Say hi, Chuck.
[14:52:45] <Wilto> hey guys
[14:53:03] <Wilto> Alright, back to work.
[14:55:42] <johnbender> :)
[14:56:02] <johnbender> Wilto: _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: can anyone confirm that CriOS is unique to chrome on iOS?
[14:56:26] <johnbender> nevermind https://developers.google.com/chrome/mobile/docs/user-agent
[14:56:40] <johnbender> why don't I just trust google and click the first link ._.

[15:46:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Check out branch dom-creation (^)
[15:47:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I changed the syntax slightly: { tagname: [ { attr: value, attr1: value1 }, [ children go here ] ] }
[15:47:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Both elements in the array pointed to by tagname can be optional.
[15:48:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... although I haven't figured out how to tell the DOM to create an attribute with no value ... checked: true results in checked="true", not checked.
[15:49:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It shouldn't make a difference.
[15:50:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: An element can also be a string, resulting in a textNode.
