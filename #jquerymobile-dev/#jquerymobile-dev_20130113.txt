[08:44:08] <agcolom> hey! arschmitz just in case you're around, I'm looking at adding the range sliders to the api docs... Which is the best url to look at demos? i
[08:45:40] <agcolom> I'd need a list of methods/events and options. I'll use the sliders ones for now as I guess there should be some duplication.... 
[08:50:39] <agcolom> I guess the url is http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/range.html ?

[12:20:16] <arschmitz> agcolom: You still around?
[12:57:41] <agcolom> arschmitz: hi!
[12:57:54] <arschmitz> Hi
[12:58:35] <arschmitz> I'm working on docs page for range but trying to get new laptop setup
[12:59:04] <agcolom> sure :-) is it a lot different from slider?
[12:59:21] <arschmitz> The most up to date page is jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos
[12:59:30] <arschmitz> Then go to range slider
[12:59:53] <arschmitz> No actually it's exactly the same methods and options as slider
[13:00:05] <arschmitz> No difference at all
[13:00:27] <agcolom> that's great! so the name is rangeslider?
[13:00:45] <arschmitz> Oh except highlight is true by default instead of false
[13:00:55] <agcolom> ok
[13:00:55] <arschmitz> Yes rangeslider
[13:01:40] <arschmitz> I'm also going to update swipe it is now extendable 
[13:02:54] <agcolom> I've started to convert the slider api doc page to the rangeslider... and I just say it's a "double edge slider". Is that correct?
[13:03:21] <agcolom> (I'm not sure the expression is correct...)
[13:03:31] <arschmitz> Double handle will probably be more clear
[13:03:44] <agcolom> great! Thanks!
[13:03:54] <arschmitz> No problem
[13:04:24] <arschmitz> I don't even have git or irc on my laptop yet lol
[13:05:43] <agcolom> no worries :-) Well I'll do a bit more this evening (now)... should be ok for now to get a good part done...
[13:12:25] <agcolom> arschmitz: is it necessary to have the 2 inputs and labels inside a div to get a sliderange?
[13:12:39] <arschmitz> Yes
[13:12:46] <agcolom> thank you :-)
[13:12:53] <arschmitz> No problem
[13:31:13] <agcolom> arschmitz: sorry one more question: do both labels (one for each input) need to be identical? (which one gets displayed if they're not).
[13:31:48] <arschmitz> No they don't only first label is shown second is hidden
[13:32:38] <arschmitz> That way it gracefully degrades to two native rang inputs with labels 
[13:33:10] <agcolom> perfect! Thank you!
[13:33:32] <arschmitz> Not a problem thank you for working on it :)
