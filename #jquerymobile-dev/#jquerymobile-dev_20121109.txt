[08:21:47] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker
[08:22:05] <uGoMobi> yeah been busy :)
[08:28:31] <uGoMobi> ?tell _|Nix|_ maybe we should do the controlgroup and collapsible set refresh method the same way as I did for listviews... if no visible elements at all (on "create") rely on class "ui-screen-hidden" and we document that as a convention to initially hide elements. Also, we should trigger "updatelayout" if !create
[08:28:37] <bot-t> uGoMobi, Okay.
[08:45:03] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I like that idea
[08:45:10] <toddmparker> so we can use css by default
[08:45:56] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: not exactly, we still need the JS to add the ui-first-child and ui-last-child classes
[08:46:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: problem is that on create the jQuery :visible selector won't return anything because nothing is visible yet
[08:48:28] <uGoMobi> there is no way to select the last visible element with CSS only, even if we know the hidden element(s) that come after it have class "ui-screen-hidden" :(
[08:55:11] <uGoMobi> CSS is a one way thing... we can use > + ~ in selectors but no < - ^ or something like that
[08:55:16] <uGoMobi> :(
[09:06:13] <agcolom> hi, I just have 2 minutes before I take my daughter to her guitar lesson... and I have a very quick question:
[09:06:47] <agcolom> How should we document setting the option of a collapsible widget?
[09:07:35] <agcolom> in the api docs, I have initially said what we had in the 'old' docs:
[09:07:38] <agcolom> To set the value for all instances of this widget, bind this option to the mobileinit event:
[09:07:38] <agcolom> $( document ).bind( "mobileinit", function(){
[09:07:38] <agcolom>     $.mobile.collapsible.prototype.options.collapseCueText = " collapse with a click";
[09:07:38] <agcolom> });
[09:08:58] <agcolom> however, the new xslt allows for creating the option example 'on the fly' by simply taking the value set for the specific example. In this case, it generates:
[09:09:10] <agcolom> Initialize the collapsible with the collapseCueText option specified:
[09:09:10] <agcolom> $( ".selector" ).collapsible({ collapseCueText: " collapse with a click" });
[09:09:24] <agcolom> it then also generated the getter and setter:
[09:09:44] <agcolom> / getter
[09:09:44] <agcolom> var collapseCueText = $( ".selector" ).collapsible( "option", "collapseCueText" );
[09:09:44] <agcolom>  
[09:09:44] <agcolom> // setter
[09:09:45] <agcolom> $( ".selector" ).collapsible( "option", "collapseCueText", " collapse with a click" );
[09:10:06] <agcolom> (see details at http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible/#option-collapseCueText)
[09:12:36] <agcolom> what should I use? (the 1st code section which is what we had before, or are the other 2 sections of code ok as well?) it seems very different to me, while the generated code is ok for other widgets such as checkboxradio
[09:12:39] <agcolom> ?
[09:12:41] <agcolom> Thanks
[09:12:57] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ^ ? gseguin ? ^
[09:30:06] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yeah, the selectors aren't quite what we need
[09:32:17] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think I touched this subject in the mail I sent you about buttons
[09:33:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you can configure the default value of an option by binding to mobileinit
[09:34:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: if you set the option when you call the plugin it will override the default value
[09:34:41] <uGoMobi> that is your second example... Initialize the collapsible with the collapseCueText option specified
[09:36:13] <uGoMobi> I don't know how that "creating an example on the fly" works but I can imagine that configuring the default won't work
[09:37:04] <uGoMobi> that is because you have to bind to mobileinit before you load jQuery Mobile JS
[09:38:09] <uGoMobi> so maybe it's best to document all options like this ... $( ".selector" ).collapsible({ collapseCueText: " collapse with a click" });
[09:38:56] <uGoMobi> and we mention that the default can be configured
[09:39:18] <uGoMobi> and probably also that we expose the option as a data- attribute
[09:47:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom: here is a JS Bin that demonstrates the different ways you can set an option and how those override eachother... http://jsbin.com/uceduf/8/edit
[09:56:54] <toddmparker> thanks for helping out agcolom, uGoMobi
[09:57:54] <uGoMobi> np, what's your opinion about how we should document this, toddmparker ?
[09:58:52] <uGoMobi> we aren't very consistent with this in the current docs so nice opportunity to improve this
[10:25:24] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: agreed
[10:26:12] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: might be good to have you write a simple page that explains the various ways to set options gob ally vs. per instance and using data attrs
[10:26:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes I think that's a good idea
[10:27:13] <toddmparker> i'm happy to edit what you hash out, but you do a great job of expelling things clearly
[10:27:18] <uGoMobi> is there space for that in the new API docs or should that go in the "standalone" docs?
[10:28:06] <toddmparker> we should do more things like this: try to write up clear guides on common tasks: setting options, loading scripts and styles, creating style overrides, RWD concepts
[10:28:29] <toddmparker> let's make a section in the demos for these kind of guides
[10:28:47] <toddmparker> we may end up copying moving some over the to api side, but it's easiest to start there
[10:28:51] <uGoMobi> yes, the information is a bit too much fragmented right now
[10:28:54] <toddmparker> i can move my red stuff there
[10:28:57] <toddmparker> right
[10:29:33] <toddmparker> i see us having a section of basic concepts like that in demos and maybe an advanced section with the phone gap, backbone pages from the current docs
[10:29:50] <toddmparker> plus the sample pages we already have and more real-world custom demos
[10:32:33] <uGoMobi> I agree
[10:43:42] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Thanks a lot :-)
[10:43:56] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you're welcome
[11:03:21] <uGoMobi> I have to go... have a great weekend all!
[11:03:47] <uGoMobi> ?tell arschmitz_ : safe travels and good luck monday!
[11:03:48] <bot-t> uGoMobi, Okay.
[12:02:27] <johnbender> toddmparker: did you get my heads up on the email?
[12:04:38] <frequent> johnbender: you there?
[12:05:49] <johnbender> frequent: yessir
[12:06:22] <frequent> I've been working on my panel navigation the last couple of days and need some input:
[12:06:54] <johnbender> shoot
[12:08:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll have a look at the way listview is done.
[12:08:13] <bot-t> (5 hours 19 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell _|Nix|_ : we can't drop the horizontal controlgroup check in checkboxradio JS because we only apply the active state in that case
[12:08:14] <bot-t> (3 hours 39 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell _|Nix|_ maybe we should do the controlgroup and collapsible set refresh method the same way as I did for listviews... if no visible elements at all (on "create") rely on class "ui-screen-hidden" and we document that as a convention to initially hide elements. Also, we should trigger "updatelayout" if !create
[12:08:14] <frequent> If a container has position:absolute (like a popup), changepages are crisp and blink free (because dimensions of the container are "hardcoded". But for background panels I'm trying forever to maintain position:static.
[12:09:08] <frequent> Whilte this works, when I have a menu/main layout, and do a changePage on the main panel, during the transition the panel stretches across the menu panel (when pulling the new page in), which looks really awful.
[12:09:26] <frequent> So question would be:
[12:10:14] <frequent> if I'm re-calculating container dimensions after every transition and content load anyways, should "background" also get position:absolute and fixed dimensions in order to have clean transitions?
[12:11:06] <frequent> Example of how it not looks nice:
[12:12:25] <frequent>  http://bit.ly/UzMXzn
[12:12:48] <frequent> hit "Marken" on the footer, then click a link on the menu
[12:13:55] <johnbender> frequent: the css question is a bit out of my wheelhouse but I see what you mean
[12:14:16] <frequent> I'm also thinking about forcing FADE, but I don't really want to.
[12:14:38] <frequent> Whose brain should I pick regarding the CSS? :-)
[12:14:56] <johnbender> frequent: toddmparker uGoMobi scottjehl__
[12:15:35] <frequent> ok. Thanks.
[12:15:46] <frequent> How is your nav coming along? Anxious to see...
[12:17:33] <johnbender> frequent: well the test suite is passing
[12:17:37] <johnbender> but it's only the navigate event
[12:17:46] <johnbender> also I need to think about the api internally a bit
[12:17:50] <johnbender> but it's moving
[12:18:02] <frequent> cool.
[12:20:40] <frequent> I'm sitting over#4935 now, good it's slated for 1.4, not so easy...
