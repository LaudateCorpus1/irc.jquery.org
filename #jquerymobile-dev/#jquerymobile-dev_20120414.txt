[20:12:45] <LakWork> anyone active in here?
[20:14:24] <LakWork> have any of you noticed a scenario on android 2.2 where, after navigating to a page, hitting back, and then navigating to another page, on the last page load you get redirected back to the page you started on, but the URL remains what it was before the redirect occurred.
[20:15:34] <LakWork> the loading image is appearing when this occurs
[21:13:42] <deAtog> LakWork: this is a known issue with jQM 1.1.. I reported it, but they haven't addressed it yet
[21:14:51] <deAtog> LakWork: the current work-around is to disable pushState via $.mobile.pushStateEnabled = false; in your mobileinit function
[21:18:42] <deAtog> LakWork: See here for more information: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3980
[21:18:43] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #3980 on jquery-mobile (konrado; 1w, 18h ago): 1.1 RC2, Android, data-rel back doesn't work correctly in some cases
[21:36:30] <LakWork> oh god i love you deAtog
