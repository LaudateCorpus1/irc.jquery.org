[08:26:54] <_|Nix|_> Nice!
[08:27:14] <toddparker> i think we were dangerously close to 600 at some point
[08:27:24] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: What do you think about reloading the initial page if it has a &ui-state=dialog in it?
[08:27:39] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... after having stripped out the &ui-state=dialog ...
[08:28:01] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I made a PR proposing that as a fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4423

[08:28:32] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Seems to work fine, but on the Nokia N950 it causes the page to display twice: Once with the dialogHashKey in place, and again without.

[09:00:19] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: commented on the commit
[09:00:28] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Thanks!
[09:00:36] * gseguin is still looking into it

[09:01:47] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That's why I put the var in there.
[09:02:16] <gseguin> oh I wasn't talking about the function call
[09:02:24] <gseguin> just the variable declaration
[09:02:40] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see ... declare above, assign inside the if. OK.
[09:02:45] <gseguin> it's part of the jQuery coding standards
[09:03:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Aha ... OK ... I guess I better start looking into that ...
[09:03:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Thanks!
[09:03:27] <gseguin> no problem
[09:04:12] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Gotta go AFK for about 30 min, but please let me know what you think about the navigation implications, too ... should be pretty clean, but I'm not 100% sure ...

[09:17:42] <uGoMobi> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4428
[09:17:43] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4428 on jquery-mobile (Wouter-; 7h, 32m ago): Events fired multiple times when navigating back
[09:18:15] <uGoMobi> gseguin: isn't it an issue that pagebeforechange" is fired twice?
[09:34:49] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it's "by design" currently
[09:34:51] <johnbender> that is
[09:34:59] <johnbender> we don't have a choice as is now
[09:35:13] <johnbender> we need to do something of an overhaul now
[09:36:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that is, because the first argument to changepage has the type { HTMLElement | jQuery.fn.init | string }
[09:36:16] <johnbender> we have to fire the event in either case
[09:36:27] <johnbender> but loadpage uses changepage internally
[09:36:43] <johnbender> or the callback to the deferred that loadpage returns uses change :P
[09:36:46] * johnbender falls out of his chair
[09:57:41] <toddparker> looks like we just need to document this clearly and add notes to these issues saying it's by design and why.
[09:59:26] <toddparker> that multiple event thing definitely causes confusion but if we explain how wonky these browsers are, might help
[09:59:27] <gseguin> sorry uGoMobi, that particular issue happened only when hitting back
[10:00:01] <johnbender> "by design"
[10:00:01] <johnbender> big quotes
[10:00:01] <johnbender> I would just choose an issue as canonical and then close the others in favor of discussion there
[10:00:26] <JasonDScott> Hi All. I have reviewed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4433 and it looks like it is good to go. Is there a special process for merging or do you just hit the green button?
[10:00:27] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1h, 50m ago): Slider: Just create an ID for the label if it lacks
[10:03:56] <MauriceG> JasonDScott: Hi! Pleased to meet you!  Thanks and sorry again ...
[10:04:40] <JasonDScott> MauriceG: Sorry for what?
[10:05:15] <MauriceG> Cause toddparker ask you for review. Not me ...
[10:05:41] <johnbender> toddparker: do you think they are confusing the chrome multiple log issue with the events?
[10:05:46] <johnbender> we trigger the event twice
[10:05:51] <johnbender> it's our fault
[10:05:56] * johnbender might be confused
[10:09:34] <JasonDScott> MauriceG: Oh don't worry about that. It does not matter
[10:09:39] <uGoMobi> johnbender: sorry, i was on the phone. thanks for the explanation.
[10:12:59] <MauriceG> JasonDScott: Thank you!  In which part of the world you are clicking green buttons?
[10:13:29] <JasonDScott> Toronto, Canada
[10:14:01] <MauriceG> cool!  ... :-)
[10:14:59] <johnbender> uGoMobi: no worries
[10:15:02] <johnbender> uGoMobi: totally my fault
[10:15:11] <MauriceG> So you've lunch time now ...
[10:16:06] <JasonDScott> MauriceG: Yes, but I am back to work already :|
[10:17:10] <agcolom> Hi Jason! Canada! That's so cool!
[10:19:41] <MauriceG> JasonDScott: But it seems, you're not a woodcutter  ;-)
[10:19:56] <JasonDScott> Hi Anne, I would take the uk instead :)
[10:20:22] <MauriceG> Never!  (sorry Anne :-)
[10:21:42] <JasonDScott> MauriceG: No I am a lumber jack. But I was pressured into it in school :P
[10:22:35] <JasonDScott> MauriceG: Much happy here tho
[10:23:00] <agcolom> French people have this idealistic view of Canada I think...
[10:23:49] <agcolom> although at the moment I hear in the news there is a lot of tension with the students
[10:24:48] <JasonDScott> Just the french students. I think its in their blood

[10:25:02] <johnbender> is there anyway to get around the page refresh?
[10:25:16] <johnbender> I'm assuming doing any other url manipulation results in a history entry
[10:26:57] <agcolom> Ah, that's why it's only in the French news! Yes, sorry about that... you're right, must be a DNA issue ;-)
[10:30:24] <JasonDScott> agcolom: I am glad they are standing up for themselves I just wish they would do it in a better way. When the students are happy Montreal is a fantastic place :) And definitely worth a visit.

[10:47:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, I was actually surprised that setting location.href does not result in a new history entry ...
[10:48:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I also don't want to use pushState, because that may or may not be available.
[10:58:06] <gseguin> _|Nix|_, toddparker, Wilto. johnbender, agcolom, JasonDScott, uGoMobi, scottjehl, kinblas: G+ hangout posted on your G+ stream
[10:58:36] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:59:16] <toddparker> thanks
[10:59:32] <kborchers> gseguin: mind sending me an invite if not everyone attends and there is an empty spot?
[11:00:07] <gseguin> kborchers: we'll be broadcasting on youtube
[11:00:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm wondering if it won't be a bit jarring to have a random page refresh in certain situations
[11:00:42] <johnbender> though I don't know what else we should do in that case
[11:00:52] <johnbender> just wondering if there's some other work around

[11:09:08] <gseguin> kborchers: do you see the broadcast?
[11:09:22] <kborchers> gseguin: don't know where it is
[11:09:51] <gseguin> kborchers: hold on

[11:23:25] <maxlynch> Hey guys. What's the reasoning behind  the fixed font size in headers and footers (.ui-header .ui-title)?
[11:24:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We only have a refresh on init, if the initial URL contains a dialogHashKey ...
[11:24:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Never from one jqm page to another ...
[12:03:51] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah, I'm just wondering if that's jarring
[12:04:04] <johnbender> obviously the alternative is also jarring!
[12:04:10] <johnbender> something to ask todd and wilto
[12:04:13] <johnbender> and scottjehl
[12:04:23] <johnbender> end user stuff
[12:08:55] <toddparker> maxlynch: are you asking why all the headings are the same font size?
[12:09:27] <toddparker> if so, we did that so you can choose the right semantic level for your page but not have it impact the appearance
[12:09:44] <toddparker> that was the theory anyway
[12:17:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4434
[12:17:02] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4434 on jquery-mobile (gseguin; 47m, 6s ago): Split css metadata into structure and theme
[12:17:31] <uGoMobi> seems to me that it can be done with regular expression search and replace
[12:29:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Is it true that, whenever the user hits back or forward or whatever, the hash passed into _handleHashChange is always of the form #<path><optional dialog hash>?
[12:30:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: not if it's an arbitrary hash
[12:30:37] <johnbender> it could be a page id
[12:30:42] <johnbender> I think at least
[12:30:53] <johnbender> it's so hard to hold that whole thing inside my head :(
[12:32:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Either way, it should never be /just/ a dialogHashKey ...
[12:32:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah, unless of course someone has deeplinked one :D but I'm guessing that's your point
[12:33:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... because that's exactly what you get when you hit "Back" to the initial page that contained a dialogHashKey ...
[12:33:39] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: as long as the pushstate plugin is working properly that should be the case
[12:34:18] <johnbender> since it should disable any hashchange event that would follow a "squish" of the hash into the url
[12:35:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Right, and when pushstate is disabled, no squishing happens anyway ...
[12:37:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ... I might just try to run with this: If ever "#&ui-state=dialog" ends up getting passed into _handleHashChange() then that must mean you should load /
[12:40:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: off the top of my head that seems to make sense to me
[12:40:56] <johnbender> good thinking!
[12:43:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OTOH, look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4097

[12:44:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Wouldn't want to re-introduce it ...
[12:44:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I should make a unit test for that ... although that's hard to test because it requires that one go outside of jqm ...
[12:45:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Should probably special case that for when the urlHistory.activeIndex === 1, so, like, if urlHistory.activeIndex === 1 && hash === "#&ui-state=dialog" go to /

[13:16:28] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I may have found a way to do it without any "jarring" effects.
[13:17:15] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: If you're about to display the first page and the location contains a dialogHashKey, display it as if the user had clicked a link to get to it, rather than directly.
[13:18:07] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'm wondering - maybe I should do a branch instead of a PR, because then I'd get a branch preview so everyone can try it out right away. What do you think? Should I make a branch?
