[06:19:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: ping
[07:53:23] <toddmparker_> hi uGoMobi
[07:53:58] <toddmparker_> looks like we have a failure ^^
[07:55:18] <toddmparker_> one thing I keep hearing on twitter: "Should I go responsive web design or jQuery Mobile"
[07:55:34] <toddmparker_> which is why i really want to kick up our RWD stuff for 1.3
[07:55:55] <toddmparker_> cool thing wilto has been working on - http://filamentgroup.github.com/Slidenav/demo/over-down.html
[07:56:28] <toddmparker_> choose options in the menu to change position: left, right, top, bottom (not working) and whether it opens over or pushes the page
[07:57:09] <toddmparker_> wondering if this would be worth considering for inclusion
[08:01:45] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker_
[08:02:19] <uGoMobi> yeah I think the failure has to do with the new tests _|Nix|_ is working on
[08:02:52] <ajpiano> toddmparker_: did you get my e-mail yesterday
[08:02:53] <uGoMobi> maybe we should do a blog post in a few weeks about what RWD stuff people can expect in 1.3
[08:04:16] <ajpiano> JasonDScott: is Eric Oros Oros the colleague of yours who you wanted to have attend the summit?
[08:04:38] <JasonDScott__> ajpiano: Yes he is
[08:04:51] <ajpiano> sure was nice of you to give him the coupon code for free bowling before we figured out the summit piece :p
[08:06:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: that demo looks cool, I like the push left/right feature
[08:06:28] <ajpiano> i'm obviously totally happy to have him come, i was just trying to iron out with toddmparker_ whether he would be coming with a normal ticket or we'd be comping his summit ticket
[08:08:31] <JasonDScott__> Ok. I thought it would be fine for him to sign up for the bowling while the rest gets figured out.
[08:13:29] <toddmparker_> ajpiano: not sure. re: the summit leads?
[08:13:55] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: yes, we need to do that once we settle out on scope and have some rough demos
[08:14:07] <toddmparker_> oh, sorry
[08:14:12] <toddmparker_> i'll respond
[08:14:21] <toddmparker_> ajpiano: thought I did!
[08:14:39] <ajpiano> lets just hash out quickly in PM
[08:16:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I was looking for you to discuss a few things about issues for roadmap, 1.1.2 and the summit
[08:17:05] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: go for it
[08:17:48] <uGoMobi> the issues with milestone 1.1.2 are all fixed toolbars / Android
[08:18:00] <uGoMobi> that might be more something for the summit
[08:18:04] <toddmparker_> not surprising
[08:18:13] <uGoMobi> weird bugs that require a lot of testing etc
[08:18:14] <toddmparker_> yeah, we could hack away at those
[08:18:25] <toddmparker_> these are open issues for 1.1.2, right?
[08:18:27] <uGoMobi> is wating unti after the summit with 1.1.2 too late?
[08:18:32] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:19:08] <uGoMobi> other option is to pick some other issues that we can fix for 1.1.2
[08:19:10] <toddmparker_> we may end up releasing 1.1.2 soon just to get some fixes out there
[08:19:30] <toddmparker_> if we end up fixing more fixed toolbar issues,w e can always drop another maintenance release for 1.1 if need be
[08:20:58] <uGoMobi> do we have a change log already?
[08:21:18] <uGoMobi> I think those 10 fixes are not the only ones https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=&milestone=16&page=1&state=closed
[08:21:44] <uGoMobi> probably ppicked some more that were also in the 1.2 changelog
[08:22:02] <toddmparker_> sure there are more
[08:22:14] <toddmparker_> there are a lot of issues in 1.1.2 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&milestone=18&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
[08:22:31] <toddmparker_> but i think we may just move a lot of those forward
[08:22:40] <uGoMobi> thats 1.2.1 not 1.1.2
[08:23:23] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=&milestone=16&page=1&state=open
[08:23:28] <toddmparker_> :)
[08:23:40] <toddmparker_> right, sorry. you already posted that
[08:23:47] <uGoMobi> np
[08:24:08] <uGoMobi> I suggest to move those to 1.2.1 because they are perfect for summit
[08:24:08] <toddmparker_> man, these are going to be hard to fix
[08:24:19] <toddmparker_> just spooky android things
[08:24:22] <uGoMobi> I can look for a few other issues that seem easy to fx
[08:24:54] <uGoMobi> so we can look at those now and maybe do a 1.1.2 RC next week
[08:25:55] <toddmparker_> good idea.
[08:26:05] <uGoMobi> any other specific things you and Wilto have in mind for summit
[08:26:21] <toddmparker_> mind creating a dev summit tag so we can collect stuff to focus on
[08:26:46] <uGoMobi> I suggest to label them first and then create issues at the summit repo issue tracker later
[08:26:50] <uGoMobi> haha
[08:26:58] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: I'd like to hack on all the new stuff so we can get it all roughed out for 1.3
[08:27:43] <uGoMobi> what do you mean by new stuff ?
[08:27:52] <uGoMobi> popup issues?
[08:27:52] <toddmparker_> get the new website in good shape, help fill out api docs, fix key issues, rough out 1.3 features
[08:28:27] <toddmparker_> new stuff = rough out the new responsive grids, table plugin, maybe these panels
[08:28:36] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[08:28:45] <toddmparker_> some easier new features like the dialog close button option
[08:28:51] <uGoMobi> sorry I was thinking about the table that Wilto and I lead... "bug fixes"
[08:28:57] <toddmparker_> easier to hash out design and API stuff in person
[08:29:12] <uGoMobi> true
[08:29:51] <toddmparker_> we're going to have some people here to help fix issues
[08:30:15] <toddmparker_> so if you can start flagging issues you'd like to work on with a team, that would be a good place to start
[08:30:37] <toddmparker_> i'll coordinate with agcolom on what docs/API stuff she'd like help with
[08:31:02] <toddmparker_> and we're prepping some of the 1.3 feature stuff so we have a jump
[08:31:54] <uGoMobi> ok, the table topics "mobile bugs fixes" and "mobile triage" confused me a bit
[08:46:02] <toddmparker_> i have a feeling we'll re-name as we get closer
[08:46:24] <toddmparker_> clarify exactly what each group is doing
[08:48:48] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:49:43] <uGoMobi> it's clear to me now what we want to work on
[08:50:08] <uGoMobi> so I will start flagging issues
[09:20:32] <gseguin> mornin'
[09:22:40] <gseguin> _|Nix|_, JasonDScott__: so we get triage heh?
[09:23:32] <gseguin> does that mean no writing code for like... 2 days?
[09:49:41] <JasonDScott__> gseguin: _|Nix|_ seems like a lot of no coding. Can we automate this?
[09:55:44] <toddmparker_> hey all
[09:56:04] <gseguin> hey toddmparker_
[09:56:24] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[09:56:56] <uGoMobi> coding? what's that? I only know labels and flagging :D
[09:57:08] <toddmparker_> i think we all need to think about what we want to achieve in DC, then focus who is where
[09:57:13] <toddmparker_> those are prelim tables
[09:57:35] <toddmparker_> but we do have a huge need for triage, PR review, fixes
[09:58:03] <toddmparker_> maybe tomorrow, we can do a hangout and try to hash this out
[09:58:19] <uGoMobi> +1
[09:59:41] <toddmparker_> some twitter love:
[09:59:43] <toddmparker_> I recommend don't use jquery mobile in production environments. It's like a kick in your balls. (is this expression exist ?)
[09:59:43] <toddmparker_> – @SergiGP
[10:00:05] <toddmparker_> enjoy!
[10:00:13] <toddmparker_> dev lead call in a minute
[10:00:18] <toddmparker_> i'll report back in a bit
[10:00:19] <uGoMobi> :(
[10:00:37] <gseguin> +1
[11:00:18] <toddmparker_> topic for tomorrow: https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/wiki
[11:43:04] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Hi! Yes please :-)
[12:00:04] <toddmparker_> hey agcolom
[12:00:35] <toddmparker_> it would be great if you can start organizing tasks for the API docs - assume you have 2 people to help you
[12:00:46] <toddmparker_> be great to get a lot fo docs written
[12:01:54] <agcolom> toddmparker_: yes! Are you happy with the way the api docs is written at the moment? (i.e. can we continue with the same format)
[12:02:40] <toddmparker_> Anne-Gaelle Colom
[12:02:40] <toddmparker_> Raship Shah
[12:02:40] <toddmparker_> Patrick Ashamalla
[12:02:41] <toddmparker_> Mutlu Tevfik Koçak
[12:02:41] <toddmparker_> Robert Bosse
[12:02:41] <toddmparker_> Jorge Passano
[12:02:42] <toddmparker_> Mike Auteri
[12:02:54] <toddmparker_> ^^ list of UI/mobile docs volunteers
[12:03:07] <toddmparker_> so you have at least 3
[12:03:15] <agcolom> yes, this is a big team!
[12:03:22] <toddmparker_> agcolom: absolutely, the API docs look great
[12:03:50] <agcolom> Cool! thanks :-)
[12:03:55] <toddmparker_> yeah, so being organized so we can quickly get'em up to speed and farm out widgets to work on is key
[12:04:06] <toddmparker_> you'd be there to answer Q's and do quality control
[12:04:11] <toddmparker_> you have MINIONS
[12:04:13] <agcolom> Yes, I need to update my checklist...
[12:04:39] <agcolom> (that's a big change for me ;-) )
[12:04:56] <toddmparker_> we should knock off all widgets, then start going through all the other scripts
[12:04:59] <agcolom> I like doing!
[12:05:17] <toddmparker_> you've set a great direction
[12:05:20] <agcolom> yes, so i think we still need headers, footers, navbars...
[12:05:31] <toddmparker_> but having more people to help will be great
[12:06:02] <toddmparker_> yeah
[12:06:09] <toddmparker_> we have lots of others to do
[12:06:33] <agcolom> then there are other things that also need to go in, not too sure how yet... (e.g. layout grids)
[12:06:55] <toddmparker_> hashchange, controlgroup, degradeinputs, events, fieldcontain, grid, init, links, media, navigation
[12:07:07] <agcolom> I've nearly finished listview...
[12:07:11] <toddmparker_> cool
[12:07:30] <toddmparker_> even if we just had people document what is in the code in a raw form, that's cool
[12:07:47] <toddmparker_> most of these aren't documented anywhere really
[12:08:30] <agcolom> ok. Would be good to have someone from dev to check stuff and answer questions also... but we'll be close to each other so should be ok
[12:27:11] <toddmparker_> yep, we're all sitting next to each other
[12:27:59] <agcolom> toddmparker_: so where will you be? I was thinking that you may be rotating?
[12:28:14] <toddmparker_> yeah, I anticipate floating between tables
[12:32:28] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: you here?
[12:32:50] <toddmparker_> guess not :)
[12:32:55] <toddmparker_> think johnbender is out
[12:33:06] <toddmparker_> gseguin: is wednesday your jQM day?
[12:36:36] <agcolom> toddmparker_: I thing page transition should also be documented in the api docs...
[12:37:04] <agcolom> think ^
[12:37:31] <gseguin> toddmparker_: tomorrow since we have the meeting
[12:37:50] <gseguin> maybe a split day tomorrow and Friday depending on what's going on here
[12:39:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: now I am
[12:50:27] <Wilto> We will fix every bug, uGoMobi.
[12:51:12] <uGoMobi> we sure will Wilto
[12:51:32] <uGoMobi> close the issue tracker after the summit
[12:52:09] <Wilto> Hell, we might have to make some up, depending on how much time we have left over afterwards.
[12:53:24] <uGoMobi> yeah, let's delete buttonMarkup or something
[12:56:55] <uGoMobi> Wilto: would be cool if we can fix some of those fixed toolbar issues that are open for so long already
[13:00:31] <toddmparker_> yeah, if fixable :)
[13:00:43] <toddmparker_> we'll have all the right people there to hack on it
[13:01:01] <toddmparker_> gseguin: ok, cool
[13:01:09] <toddmparker_> what's on your plate?
[13:01:19] <gseguin> toddmparker_: you tell me
[13:01:24] <toddmparker_> we can start working on 1.3 stuff - be fun
[13:01:36] <gseguin> yup
[13:02:06] <Wilto> Anyone need me for anything before I fugue out on this nav thing again?
[13:03:25] <gseguin> Wilto, uGoMobi: when you're done with jQM bugs maybe you can tackle some of the the iOS6 bugs
[13:04:32] <Wilto> Sure, we could spare an hour or so.
[13:05:48] <gseguin> on that matter I thought I'd share
[13:06:21] <gseguin> last week I pinged you guys regarding a flashing happening in our PhoneGap wrapped app when using $.scrollTo
[13:06:43] <gseguin> I was not able to build a test case on build.phonegap.com
[13:07:04] <gseguin> the reason for that is that they must not be using the latest SDK
[13:07:43] <gseguin> if you use the latest SDK ( which is required if you want to submit a splash screen that works on iPhone5 ) then you'll have that bug
[13:08:06] <gseguin> you have to use an older SDK to work around that bug
[13:23:40] <agcolom> gseguin: someone just said that one of the iOS6 bug was due to something else! So at least that's one less to deal with ;-)
[13:24:17] <gseguin> heh :)
[13:34:55] <agcolom> toddmparker_: do you know what skills the people on the UI Mobile Docs table have?
[13:40:38] <toddmparker_> agcolom: i'm not 100% sure
[13:40:49] <toddmparker_> those are all people who said they wanted to focus on ui or mobile docs
[13:40:59] <toddmparker_> gotta be some useful people there
[13:41:22] <toddmparker_> you should have some more menial tasks reserved for less advanced people
[13:41:44] <toddmparker_> and some harder stuff so once you figure out abilities, you can keep everyone busy
[13:41:46] <agcolom> Yes, I have to prepare a full list... ideas welcome ;-)
[13:42:27] <toddmparker_> hmmm, interesting on the PG iOS6 stuff
[13:42:39] <toddmparker_> we've had a few bugs come in that turned out to be PG issues
[13:43:45] <agcolom> indeed!
[14:00:24] <agcolom> ok, goodnight everyone! I have to catch up with my sleep...
[14:01:33] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Good night!
[14:01:58] <agcolom> Goodnight _|Nix|_
[14:04:25] <_|Nix|_> OK ... we need to fix the query string issues ... I suspect that's what's killing the various test runs ...
[14:05:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/n48WPg

[15:04:28] <uGoMobi> Wilto: was testing docs with core 1.7.2 on iOS 3.x on browserstack and it is C grade
[15:05:12] <uGoMobi> not sure if this is only on browserstack
[15:12:55] <uGoMobi> hmm, tried a couple of times and finally it was able to load the JS
[15:13:18] <uGoMobi> so it has nothing to do with the changes in support
[15:32:59] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_ johnbender: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/ uses core 1.7.1 instead of 1.8.2
