[08:41:31] <Wilto> with my last breath, i curse android
[08:50:48] <Wilto> Ah hey, there’s some good news, gseguin!
[08:51:16] <gseguin> good morning
[09:00:51] <Wilto> Hey, man. Good work on the CSS bundling stuff!
[09:06:56] <gseguin> thanks Wilto
[09:07:05] <gseguin> not completely done yet
[09:07:18] <gseguin> I'm having some race condition problem, working on it
[09:08:01] <gseguin> but it's encouraging for sure
[09:08:41] <Wilto> No question. Good to see a plan coming together, after the trauma I have suffered at the hands of Android 2.2/2.3/
[09:09:13] <gseguin> I know, I was reading through that... man! that a nasty one
[09:09:34] <Wilto> Yeah, brutal.
[09:09:50] <Wilto> I wanna get everyone’s thoughts on The Plan, as a result of that thing.
[09:10:03] <Wilto> Opting 2.2/2.3 out of fixed is a BIG move, and there will be outrage.
[09:10:25] <Wilto> However, that is a catastrophic bug. You literally can’t tap _anything_ on 2.2, with that combination of elements in play.
[09:11:01] <Wilto> So… I dunno.
[09:11:38] <gseguin> is there a way around it?
[09:11:44] <Wilto> Not that I’ve found.
[09:11:52] <Wilto> And I tried some serious CSS voodoo here.
[09:12:33] <Wilto> I can keep at it, but like… No fix has even looked vaguely promising, reasonable or otherwise.
[09:13:43] <Wilto> Usually I’ll stumble onto something weird, or intentionally break something in a way that makes a “fix” look possible. The only thing I found was setting a 0px height/width on the nested absolute positioned element.
[09:13:44] <gseguin> how common of a use case is it?
[09:14:04] <Wilto> Any fixed header that contains a button with an icon.
[09:14:21] <gseguin> heh, common enough :)
[09:14:28] <Wilto> Exactly.
[09:14:31] <Wilto> Or.
[09:14:43] <Wilto> I redo icon positioning to do away with position: absolute.
[09:14:46] <Wilto> Or button positioning.
[09:15:01] <Wilto> But that’s… not a pre-1.1 kinda change. That’s gonna mess with user styles.
[09:16:08] <gseguin> the good thing is that it's fixed in ICS
[09:17:35] <jzaefferer> How nice, on phones, window.orientation === 0 means portrait, on this samsung galaxy tablet it means landscape
[09:18:18] <jzaefferer> Wilto: baaaaaah
[09:18:35] <Wilto> Oh, jzaefferer.
[09:18:41] <Wilto> That is but the tip of the iceberg, my friend.
[09:19:06] <jzaefferer> Back to `$(window).width() > $(window).height()`
[09:19:06] <Wilto> I was just talking to someone about the chaos that is orientation ( https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.event.js#L194 )
[09:19:11] <jzaefferer> Ohh
[09:19:16] <Wilto> Won’t cut it in iOS.
[09:19:24] <jzaefferer> No?
[09:19:34] <jzaefferer> Nooooo?
[09:19:39] <Wilto> iOS bases everything on portrait, regardless of current orientation.
[09:19:41] <Wilto> Portrait is 320px wide, 480px high. Landscape is “320px wide, 480px high.”
[09:19:46] <Wilto> I mean, depending.
[09:19:57] <kinblas> jzaefferer: I made a modification to Ben Allman's orientationchange plugin in jQM to figure out the orientation mapping of values
[09:19:59] <Wilto> Oh, wait, so yeah—sorry, misread.
[09:20:19] <kinblas> it uses media queries to figure out the mapping when loading
[09:21:10] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.event.js#L192
[09:21:10] <Wilto> As I’ve said before: until window.noSeriouslyWhereIsTheDeviceLogo comes along, it’s chaos.
[09:21:19] <jzaefferer> okay, I've got those parts of jQuery Mobile loaded anyway, is there a way to just query for orientation?
[09:21:32] <jzaefferer> $.event.special.orientationchange.orientation()?
[09:22:03] <jzaefferer> does that work without using the orientationchange special event?
[09:22:55] <kinblas> jzaefferer: I believe it should
[09:24:21] <kinblas> of course that is subject to the platform differences as to when they actually update the window.orientation property
[09:25:35] <jzaefferer> well, I'm using viewporter to bind to the event, that seems to abstract it enough
[09:31:38] <jzaefferer> kinblas: works for that tablet (and Chrome), but its inverted on iOS :/
[09:32:15] <kinblas> jzaefferer? really?
[09:32:25] <kinblas> it was working when fine when I landed it originally
[09:32:26] * kinblas sighs
[09:32:34] <kinblas> jzaefferer: what's the test page you're using?
[09:33:01] <jzaefferer> I'll put something together
[09:33:18] <jzaefferer> as usual, the process may already surface the mistake in my code...
[09:33:40] <kinblas> jzaefferer: there's a test page in jqm in the tests/functional/orientation.html
[09:33:47] <jzaefferer> oh, nice
[09:33:52] <jzaefferer> lemme check that first
[09:34:31] <jzaefferer> kinblas: did you see my swipe ticket? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3823
[09:34:32] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3823 on jquery-mobile, reported by jzaefferer (6h, 44m ago): swipeleft/right triggered during vertical scroll
[09:36:16] <kinblas> jzaefferer: not yet, but haven't gotten through the github emails yet
[09:36:28] <kinblas> jzaefferer: I just tested the orientation.html file in jqm
[09:36:37] <kinblas> and it reports the right values all the time on my iPad
[09:37:04] <kinblas> johnbender: why isn't /test/tests available anymore?
[09:37:14] <jzaefferer> its wrong on iOS simulator with iOS 5.0 iPhone (retina)
[09:38:06] <kinblas> jzaefferer: hmm let me try the emulator. My iPad is running iOS 5.1
[09:38:06] <jzaefferer> iPad may be inverted just as that android tablet is
[09:38:55] <jzaefferer> On an actual devices, iPhone 3GS with 4.3.5 its also wrong
[09:39:56] <kinblas> jzaefferer: hmmm I just tried the ipad 4.3.5 emulator and it reports things just fine
[09:39:59] <Wilto> See? And people wonder why the jQM team is so insane.
[09:40:20] <kinblas> jzaefferer: aha!
[09:40:26] <kinblas> retina emulator is wrong
[09:41:40] <jzaefferer> yeah, generally iPhone
[09:41:47] <jzaefferer> simulated iPad works for me, too
[09:42:00] <jzaefferer> Wilto: you're just being sloppy :p
[09:42:12] <Wilto> don’t make me come over there, jzaefferer
[09:42:30] <jzaefferer> bah, baaaaah!
[09:42:52] <Wilto> You leave my lucrative new career as a shepherd out of this.
[09:44:02] <kinblas> jzaefferer: ok I see on my iphone device
[09:44:14] <kinblas> what's interesting is that I tested this on my iPodTouch 4.3.5
[09:44:16] <kinblas> and it worked
[09:44:21] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:44:23] <kinblas> (before I landed the fix)
[09:44:32] <kinblas> I dont' have the device on me at the moment to re-test
[09:45:00] <jzaefferer> I might be able to help with that, brb
[09:45:04] <kinblas> is there an issue filed already ... I'm assuming the masses have been complaining
[09:47:04] <jzaefferer> got my gruppy hands on two iPod touch(es)
[09:47:11] <johnbender> Wilto: what's positoned absolutely in the fixed footers/header?
[09:47:19] <jzaefferer> charging now, until then I don't know what version is on there
[09:47:24] <jzaefferer> I'll look for a ticket
[09:47:27] <Wilto> johnbender: Buttons, and icons within buttons.
[09:47:39] <Wilto> Changing that is the path of least resistance, for sure.
[09:48:02] <Wilto> But we’re uprooting enough styling stuff for 1.1—I’d want to wait for 1.2.
[09:48:31] <johnbender> Wilto: yah
[09:48:42] <johnbender> that seems to suggest that the plugin scott created is pretty important then
[09:49:25] <jzaefferer> kinblas: so far, I found this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/813
[09:49:26] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by depeele (1y, 1m ago): Orientation fix
[09:50:18] <Wilto> johnbender: The position: fauxed; shim?
[09:50:24] <Wilto> oh totally suggesting that name
[09:51:06] <johnbender> Wilto: I guess I'm not sure what else to do given that it's br
[09:51:20] <johnbender> eaks selects
[09:51:32] <Wilto> And in 2.2, breaks every-goddamned-thing.
[09:52:02] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_ can we ask the community to test any css changes we might come up with in a nother RC
[09:52:12] <johnbender> given that 2.2 is just strait broken
[09:52:23] <johnbender> straight
[09:52:31] <Wilto> I mean, our other options are: 1) Opt <3.0 out of fixed. 2) “Forget it, Jake. It’s Android.”
[09:52:46] <johnbender> Wilto: :(
[09:52:55] <Wilto> Right. Both suck.
[09:52:57] <johnbender> I'm voting for a css fix if possible
[09:53:03] <Wilto> I’d lean more towards the latter than the former.
[09:53:12] <Wilto> Yeah.
[09:54:10] <Wilto> I wish the hell I could turn up some voodoo to work around this.
[09:54:38] <johnbender> Wilto: removing the absolute positioned elements works though?
[09:54:48] <Wilto> The only clue I could turn up is “the browser thinks the nested absolute element doesn’t exist if it doesn’t have a height/width set.”
[09:55:00] <Wilto> Yep. The test page links to a bunch of “it works if I do this” examples.
[09:55:07] <johnbender> Wilto: going to go look
[09:55:38] <Wilto> …There has to be some workaround.
[09:57:01] <johnbender> Wilto: incidentally if you want to use a webinspector like debugging interface for stuff like this, download the phonegap app I created
[09:57:02] <Wilto> height: 0; padding-bottom: 18px; didn’t do it. I tried pointer-events, like maybe that would somehow drop it under the broken part of the rendering engine’s radar, but that was just a stab. All manner of position tweaks and overflow things—Android’s strength is in breaking things, so I figured maybe triggering another bug on that element would break it out of the original bug, which isn’
[09:57:02] <Wilto> t even a thing that makes sense outside of CSS voodoo territory.
[09:57:15] <johnbender> you can click debug on the website and it will connect you with weinere
[09:57:54] <johnbender> Wilto: it will let you tweek the css live
[09:57:59] <Wilto> Ooh.
[09:58:16] <johnbender> that, in this case will at least let you try out removing teh position abolute
[09:58:21] <johnbender> *the
[09:58:27] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, that solves it.
[09:58:41] <johnbender> I mean in terms of making it look right
[09:58:44] <Wilto> position: relative/fixed on that red square? Broken again. Static? Works fine.
[09:58:56] <Wilto> Any invocation of positioning relative to a parent.
[09:59:13] <Wilto> …wait
[09:59:48] <jzaefferer> kinblas: got a iPod touch with 4.2 running now
[10:00:06] <Wilto> Well, no, I don’t know. I also tried adding elements with various related styles all over the place, just to see if I could make any headway—no dice there, either. I don’t know that I should keep spinning my wheels on “solving” it.
[10:00:25] <Wilto> Might be best to just throw in the towel and redo icons for 1.2.
[10:09:11] <kinblas> jzaefferer: so Tyler has a 3gs running 5.1 and it always reports the correct orientation
[10:09:49] <kinblas> jzaefferer: another puzzling thing is that the iPhone 4 (ios 5) was showing the problem, but at one point, it started working correctly
[10:10:03] <kinblas> so I'm a bit puzzled ... will need to insert alerts to see what's going on
[10:12:07] <snover> wilto did it.
[10:14:19] <jzaefferer> kinblas: not working here: http://bassistance.de/i/7bb758.png
[10:14:46] <kinblas> jzaefferer: yeah I think what it is, is that it always thinks it's in landscape when the page is first loaded
[10:15:06] <kinblas> jzaefferer: if you reload the page in landscape and then test
[10:15:13] <kinblas> it's correct?
[10:17:10] <jzaefferer> nope
[10:17:28] <jzaefferer> actually when starting with landscape it works
[10:17:32] <jzaefferer> but not when starting with portrait
[10:17:57] <jzaefferer> that's something
[10:17:59] <jzaefferer> still bad
[10:39:01] <Wilto> What’re you cooking up over there by the way, jzaefferer?
[10:39:44] <Wilto> Or are you simply seeking orientationchange enlightenment? (Hint: it involves a lot of drinking.)

[12:34:15] <Wilto> gseguin: http://wil.to/_/jqm-meeting.jpg
[13:02:07] <Wilto> Some transforms don’t work in Android 2.3, if a position: fixed; element is anywhere on the same page.
[13:02:27] <Wilto> So far in my testing, only “translate” still works.
[13:02:48] <Wilto> That’s not “parent of,” not “some elements.” A transform does not work on anything on a page that contains a fixed position anything else.
[13:02:57] <Wilto> i am losing my mind
[13:14:19] <Wilto> OH UPDATE. If you set the parent of the fixed element to an opacity below one, transforms work again!
[13:32:12] <Wilto> Okay.
[13:32:59] <Wilto> If the next immediate sibling of the position: fixed element is position: absolute, the things inside it become… interactable again.
[13:33:51] <gseguin> does that mean we need to change the button markup?
[13:34:04] <Wilto> Nope.
[13:34:14] <Wilto> Whatever this fix ends up being, it’ll be CSS.
[13:34:33] <Wilto> A picture is beginning to form.
[13:35:15] <Wilto> Absolute removes the next element from the same frame of reference as that which contains the fixed element. If it’s not the next immediate sibling, the next immediate sibling—as position: static; still falls within that frame of reference and thus so do its child elements?
[13:35:24] <Wilto> I’m rubberducking all you guys right now, just so we know.
[13:35:35] <Wilto> See: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/rubber-duck-problem-solving.html
[13:36:41] <Wilto> Obviously we can’t set all content elements following headers to position: absolute; without something blowing up. It’s not a feasible fix.
[13:36:55] <Wilto> But at sort of explains some things. Maybe.
[13:37:11] <Wilto> I quit; I’m going back to carpentry. Again.
[13:37:44] <gseguin> no luck being a shepherd, huh?
[13:43:13] <Wilto> Turned out they were electric sheep. Androids kept showing up for them.
[13:43:33] <Wilto> Brought it full-circle AND made a nerd reference. I am on fire today.
