[06:30:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you have your retina macbook there?
[06:33:03] <arschmitz> yup
[06:33:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you test f https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5456 is fixed with latest code?
[06:33:53] <uGoMobi> s/f/if/
[06:34:00] <arschmitz> yup
[06:34:03] <uGoMobi> cool
[06:37:34] <arschmitz>  looks good
[06:38:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think every thing is all set now
[06:38:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok great
[06:38:57] <uGoMobi> thanks for testing, I will comment and close the issue
[06:39:48] <uGoMobi> it's really ugly though... had to set background position for each icon for HD as well

[06:48:27] <arschmitz> ohh not cool
[06:59:55] <gseguin> morning all!
[07:00:07] <gseguin> johnbender: I remember now what I pinged you about
[07:01:28] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[07:01:37] <gseguin> johnbender: Would you merge master onto grunt-0.4 on a regular basis or rather wait and just merge grunt-0.4 onto master when it's ready for the world?
[07:02:19] <gseguin> hey Jasper, how are you?
[07:02:37] <uGoMobi> doing fine, thanks
[07:02:39] <gseguin> uGoMobi: will we see you in Portland?
[07:02:49] <uGoMobi> yeah I will be there
[07:03:00] <gseguin> awesome!
[07:03:10] <uGoMobi> will be great to see you guys again
[07:03:22] <gseguin> do you know who else can make it?
[07:03:34] <gseguin> absolutely!
[07:03:36] <uGoMobi> I know arschmitz is going
[07:03:52] <uGoMobi> didn't hear from the others yet
[07:04:10] <arschmitz> yeah im going for sure
[07:04:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ was going to find out if he could today
[07:04:35] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck is going
[07:04:36] <uGoMobi> nice location BTW... planning on visiting Seattle and Vancouver, CND afterwards
[07:04:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nice
[07:05:06] <arschmitz> Id love to be able to do that but just wont have the time
[07:05:17] <uGoMobi> I understand
[07:05:24] <gseguin> kewl!
[07:06:18] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I received an mail from Travis-CI... some failure report
[07:06:28] <uGoMobi> you got it too I think
[07:08:28] <gseguin> uGoMobi: don't worry about it
[07:08:40] <uGoMobi> yeah, I didn't :)
[07:08:52] <gseguin> I was playing around with it
[07:09:09] <gseguin> I think it would be cool to have it if it's not too much work
[07:09:16] <gseguin> and it doesn't seem to be 
[07:09:31] <uGoMobi> yeah for sure
[07:09:34] <uGoMobi> I like green buttons
[07:09:46] <gseguin> with the move to grunt it should be quite easy
[07:10:27] <gseguin> yeah and we're public about everything so I don't see why CI is not public
[07:10:42] <gseguin> well I mean I know why, it's not intentional I know
[07:10:54] <gseguin> it's just a matter of who could host it
[07:11:09] <gseguin> but I think TravisCI would solve that problem
[07:11:44] <gseguin> and also tell people whether or not it's ok to use master at the moment
[07:12:39] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gseguin pushed 7 new commits to 06grunt-0.4: 02http://git.io/8z0Ykw

[07:12:48] <uGoMobi> yeah Travis is a nice solution so would be cool if you can integrate it
[07:59:18] <_|Nix|_> Woah ... "Form reference" link in the demos is broken.
[07:59:26] <_|Nix|_> Hey all, BTW!
[08:10:36] <_|Nix|_> What do you guys think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5387? Should we fix it for 1.3.0?
[08:19:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: many links in the demos are broken... work in progress
[08:21:11] <_|Nix|_> Grrrr ... phantomjs times out like crazy on F18 ...
[08:26:49] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I give up ...
[08:27:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: even though its a bug
[08:27:33] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/2zQUmQ
[08:27:33] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 140da8574 15Gabriel Schulhof: Popup: Clean up focus restriction handling. Fixes #5519.
[08:27:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean I give up on running the unit tests locally.
[08:27:44] <arschmitz> that could mess with people serverside  if they have just used it as is
[08:27:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know i meant about #5387
[08:28:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh ...
[08:28:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If they have used what as is?
[08:28:53] <arschmitz> if they assume the buttons will not be part of the form data
[08:29:22] <arschmitz> if they all of a sudden start showing up it could break things
[08:29:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so might be best to wait for 1.4
[08:30:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, that's broken though. If you click on button X then button X must be part of the form data, whether it's enhanced or not.
[08:30:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Currently, if it's not enhanced, it will not be part of the form data.
[08:31:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, if you submit the form via HTTP, it will be part of the form data.
[08:31:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i 100% agree its broken and should be fixed
[08:31:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, if the same app runs on grade c and grade a, you'll get different results.
[08:31:27] <arschmitz> i just worry since it was not in the beta thats all
[08:31:31] <arschmitz> true
[08:31:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, sorry, no.
[08:31:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If it's grade c there won't be any AJAX either.
[08:31:53] <arschmitz> oh yeah lol
[08:32:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, s/ c / b /
[08:33:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In b, you'll have enhancement, but no AJAX, and you'll get the button, because it's explicitly not enhanced, whereas in C, you won't get the button, because you're submitting via AJAX.
[08:33:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think that's pretty inconsistent, if we purport to paint over browser-induced differences.
[08:34:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We're actually introducing a difference of our own.
[08:34:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok im sold 
[08:34:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think this should be kosher for 1.3.0.
[08:34:30] <arschmitz> 1.3 it is lol
[08:34:52] <_|Nix|_> :)
[08:35:17] <_|Nix|_> I wonder what toddmparker_ thinks, though he doesn't seem to be around today ...
[08:35:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah havent seen him yet today 
[08:36:04] <arschmitz> though id be suprised if he didnt agree 1.3 considdering the inconsistancy
[08:36:34] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[08:39:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: No........... not increase the timeout!
[08:39:14] <arschmitz> sorry
[08:39:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know theres no other option really just feeling dramatic
[08:43:49] <johnbender> gseguin: yo
[08:43:58] <johnbender> gseguin: merge master in if necessary
[08:44:00] <johnbender> I see no issue with that
[08:44:08] <johnbender> long lived branches often require it
[08:44:18] <johnbender> gseguin: also wrt Travis
[08:44:33] <gseguin> hey johnbender 
[08:44:39] <johnbender> it just didn't make sense for the effort given that we're always going to need swarm
[08:44:48] <johnbender> and that we haven't traditionally had a very stable test suite :/
[08:45:14] <gseguin> well it could be a quick sanity test
[08:45:19] <johnbender> ie, I ran out of gas constantly fixing the broken tests
[08:45:33] <johnbender> gseguin: yah we could have it run "unit" tests
[08:45:46] <gseguin> given the effort required (close to none) I think we should do it
[08:46:04] <gseguin> it doesn't prevent us from doing extended testing with testswarm
[08:46:19] <gseguin> yup
[08:46:19] <johnbender> gseguin: no but it does make the project look bad when the tests are failing for long periods of time
[08:46:38] <johnbender> gseguin: if we did it in conjunction with splitting out legitimate unit tests I would agree
[08:46:47] <gseguin> johnbender: We can select tests we run on it
[08:47:01] <gseguin> exactly
[08:47:05] <johnbender> yark
[08:47:09] <johnbender> -k
[08:47:12] <gseguin> who's on that?
[08:47:16] <gseguin> you ? ;P
[08:47:26] <johnbender> gseguin: lol exactly
[08:47:57] <gseguin> so I've got js/css and zip going 
[08:48:04] <gseguin> got rid of version.txt
[08:48:34] <gseguin> but still need to work on some tests that are failing because of that
[08:49:23] <gseguin> also going to get rid of using LICENSE.txt for the build
[08:49:35] <gseguin> everything build related is now in Gruntfile.js
[08:49:46] <gseguin> and package.json
[08:49:52] <_|Nix|_> Argh! So many tests timing out ... WTF ...
[08:50:17] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: on master?
[08:50:27] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1178/consoleFull
[08:50:32] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah ...
[08:50:46] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: We don't even consider those instances failures anymore ...
[08:52:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The worst part is, you can't tell whether the timeout is because of a JS exception that blows the stack or whether it's stuck waiting for an event for too long, or what ...
[08:52:47] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yeah I'm having issues with some tests on PhantomJS too
[08:53:38] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: phantomjs was rock solid on my machine until I upgraded it to F18 ... now, it times out all the time and it crashes with "pur virtual method called" ...
[08:53:45] <_|Nix|_> s/pur/pure/
[08:54:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I even tried building it from source to make sure it's not some subtle ABI mismatch, but still it crashes.
[08:55:01] <gseguin> grunt-qunit still uses 1.7 so I don't have that crash
[08:55:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hmmm ... good point ... maybe I should downgrade to 1.7.0 ...
[08:55:58] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Does npm download phantomjs as when you do npm install? I've always had to grab it separately and put it in my PATH ...
[08:56:33] <gseguin> yes in my grunt branch it does
[08:56:38] <gseguin> not sure in master
[08:58:01] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That's great! I'd hate to have to install it myself ... I was looking for a Fedora-provided RPM but I came up empty ... in fact it's only package by, like, Mandriva ...
[08:58:07] <_|Nix|_> :(
[09:13:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Im seeing serious! missalignment on icons on retina and some minor issues on non retina
[09:14:16] <arschmitz> :(
[09:14:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pfff
[09:14:22] <uGoMobi> :(
[09:14:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/668/edit
[09:14:45] <arschmitz> dont see anything wrong in docs but any where else very messed up
[09:15:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah i see it too
[09:15:14] <arschmitz> yeah the minus one is visible on all screens
[09:15:21] <uGoMobi> tired of icons lol
[09:15:26] <arschmitz> but the down arrows on retina are only half visible
[09:15:39] <arschmitz> they are pushed way to right
[09:16:09] <arschmitz> not sure why this is not visible in docs
[09:16:10] <uGoMobi> how can it be different in the docs?
[09:16:15] <uGoMobi> exactly
[09:16:17] <arschmitz> i have no idea
[09:16:42] <uGoMobi> ok i will look into it
[09:17:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: made it even easier http://jsbin.com/uzaret/668/edit
[09:17:56] <arschmitz> nothing but a delete icon 
[09:18:11] <uGoMobi> bizare
[09:18:23] <arschmitz> yeah and it both demos and docs its fine
[09:18:28] <arschmitz> its super strange
[09:18:50] <arschmitz> and retina and non retina are both messed up but in different directions
[09:19:40] <arschmitz> damn icons 
[09:19:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: should have just let chrome take the blame and left it ha ha ha 
[09:20:14] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:20:28] <uGoMobi> could have made a whole new SVG icon set in the meantime
[09:20:34] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah
[09:21:14] <arschmitz> im +1000 on svg lol
[09:23:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what stinks though is even when we switch to svg icons we still will have to deal with png's because we are going to provide them as a fallback last i checked
[09:24:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah i know
[09:24:57] <toddmparker> hey all
[09:25:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I have two JS Bins with same markup... one uses latest code local, other on server
[09:25:22] <uGoMobi> local... all fine
[09:25:27] <uGoMobi> server... all broken
[09:25:30] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker_ 
[09:25:37] <arschmitz> hey toddmparker
[09:27:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is maybe latest still on an old commit 
[09:27:25] <arschmitz> its very strange
[09:27:50] <uGoMobi> i see there is a difference in file size
[09:28:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmmm something strange is afoot!
[09:28:40] <uGoMobi> css is the same so can't be on old commit
[09:28:56] <uGoMobi> could it be something on the server?
[09:29:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no latest looks behind check this out
[09:29:24] <arschmitz> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js
[09:29:30] <arschmitz> look at the time stamp
[09:29:34] <toddmparker> hey arschmitz and uGoMobi 
[09:29:58] <toddmparker> catching up...
[09:29:59] <arschmitz> wait no that has not happened yet lol!
[09:30:17] <Wilto> We’re just that good.
[09:30:24] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: maybe you don't want to catch up... it's about icon sprite ;)
[09:30:34] <Wilto> whoop look at the time I must be going
[09:30:41] <uGoMobi> lol Wilto 
[09:32:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the commit id is right though
[09:32:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: latest uses old sprite
[09:32:17] <arschmitz> hmm
[09:32:26] <uGoMobi> maybe cache issue with Chrome
[09:32:33] <uGoMobi> going incognito
[09:32:41] <arschmitz> no i deleted it all
[09:33:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: incognito makes no difference for me
[09:33:47] <uGoMobi> same here
[09:34:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/master/css/themes/default/images/icons-18-white.png this is the correct sprite
[09:35:00] <uGoMobi> but in the JS Bin I see the old one
[09:35:05] <arschmitz> yup me too
[09:35:26] <arschmitz> i wonder if images take longer to update on server or something i have no idea
[09:35:34] <arschmitz> johnbender: gseguin:
[09:35:59] <gseguin> don't know
[09:36:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think so
[09:36:26] <arschmitz> sure seems it
[09:36:28] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi: they might cache those with fastly
[09:36:33] <johnbender> so it could be
[09:36:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: anyway... good thing is that it will be resolved as soon as the images have been updated
[09:36:51] <arschmitz> ok so maybe hold tight untill tomorrow probably
[09:36:55] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ah ok, thanks
[09:39:57] <uGoMobi> BTW - the old 18 sprite was ~58.7Kb, new one ~2.3Kb !
[09:40:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: damn nice!
[09:40:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ^^
[09:40:25] <uGoMobi> nice work! :)
[09:41:23] <Wilto> Woah.
[09:41:54] <uGoMobi> save the fireworks settings
[09:42:45] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[09:42:56] <arschmitz> thats some pretty awesome size reduction lol
[09:43:01] <uGoMobi> HD was 66.7Kb, now 4.4Kb 
[09:43:11] <arschmitz> wow thats really crazy
[09:43:19] <arschmitz> seems like something is wrong there ha ha ha 
[09:43:25] <uGoMobi> ssssst
[09:43:33] <arschmitz> lol
[09:43:33] <uGoMobi> nothing wrong
[09:43:47] <arschmitz> thats right just awesome!
[09:43:51] <uGoMobi> :)
[09:45:35] <arschmitz> maybe he used chuck norris compression.... chuck norris dosent compress png's he round house kicks them until they shrink into submission
[09:46:00] <uGoMobi> pfff chuck norris
[09:46:02] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:46:44] <arschmitz> chuck norris facts are great sometimes
[09:47:02] <uGoMobi> it's more like martial arts... magical
[09:55:34] <toddmparker> woah, the old sprite was that huge?
[09:55:40] <toddmparker> mine is barely optimized
[09:56:02] <toddmparker> they should have all been ~4kb all along
[09:56:14] <toddmparker> that is messed up
[09:57:14] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: not surprised you needed to mess with bg position
[09:57:25] <toddmparker> there are nasty sub pixel rendering differences
[09:57:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah
[09:57:51] <toddmparker> i was handling it by nudging pixels in the hd sprite but now that they are all the same, you need to nudge in css
[09:58:14] <toddmparker> the benefit of doing it in fireworks is 1px nudge = 0.5px when displayed
[09:58:18] <uGoMobi> yes, bit ugly, but ok for now
[09:58:25] <toddmparker> either way, it's annoying
[10:00:44] <arschmitz> toddmparker: if wednesday still works for you that is the day ill be down
[10:17:09] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah, wednesday works for me
[10:17:15] <toddmparker> what's your plan?
[10:17:16] <arschmitz> cool
[10:17:50] <arschmitz> you had said any time after 3 so i figured id get there shortly after that
[10:19:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker: other then that i dont have much of a plan lol

[13:35:47] <toddmparker> ok
[13:36:13] <toddmparker> we can also do a hangout if easier
[13:36:56] <RWhitbeck> Todd I put the details in SKype 
[13:43:25] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15rajkumart08 opened issue #5546: demo html wipe does not work  02http://git.io/f7GbpA
[13:44:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: toddmparker: looking to the test timeouts - it was the phantom upgrade that caused it
[13:45:06] <arschmitz> so not a problem with the tests then?
[13:46:26] <johnbender> arschmitz: no I ran them with 1.7 and it works finen
[13:46:35] <johnbender> going to debug now
[13:46:40] <arschmitz> johnbender: when you have a few minutes free need to talk to you about hash changes and the links to id's
[13:46:43] <arschmitz> cool
[13:47:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: lets do it now befor I dive in
[13:47:05] <arschmitz> ok
[13:47:34] <arschmitz> so the method we talked about really only works properly with push state
[13:47:39] <johnbender> right
[13:47:47] <johnbender> the hashchange has the same problem no matter what
[13:47:53] <arschmitz> right
[13:47:53] <johnbender> that was my fault
[13:48:16] <arschmitz> i dont think using a ui-state is a good idea though
[13:48:25] <arschmitz> so i think that kinda leaves us 2 choices
[13:48:27] <johnbender> arschmitz: is there a third option?
[13:48:30] <johnbender> ahh ok
[13:48:39] <arschmitz> we can just not support this with hashchange only 
[13:48:45] <johnbender> right
[13:48:47] <johnbender> there is that :)
[13:48:48] <arschmitz> or
[13:49:06] <arschmitz> we could do it the same way popups work when hashlistening is disabled
[13:49:18] <johnbender> just scroll without altering the url?
[13:49:22] <arschmitz> yup
[13:49:26] <johnbender> hmm
[13:49:28] <arschmitz> and dont store history for it
[13:49:32] <johnbender> that's interesting
[13:50:05] <johnbender> in that case the only thing I can think of is that we should alter the scroll position value in history
[13:50:10] <johnbender> to record where it was
[13:50:19] <johnbender> but in reality it should do that itself
[13:50:25] <johnbender> (the scroll binding)
[13:50:30] <arschmitz> yeah it should
[13:50:39] <arschmitz> id have to test to be 100% but im pretty sure
[13:50:43] <johnbender> so, support the url alteration with pushstate
[13:50:49] <johnbender> and then otherwise just scroll there
[13:50:52] <arschmitz> yup
[13:51:13] <johnbender> that should still work with event based solution since you're closing over the id of the object to be scrolled too
[13:51:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: that sounds pretty good to me
[13:51:24] <arschmitz> personally considdering nearly all browsers now support pushstate and it wont effect functionality either way 
[13:51:29] <arschmitz> cool
[13:51:36] <johnbender> arschmitz: did you run it by TP?
[13:51:39] <johnbender> oh shit
[13:51:42] <johnbender> new nickname
[13:51:45] <johnbender> toddmparker: == TP
[13:51:52] <arschmitz> not yet wanted to talk to you first
[13:52:18] <arschmitz> but i will of course
[13:52:51] <arschmitz> basicly doing it this way means code wise its exactly the same as we walked about before
[13:53:25] <arschmitz> because everything is bound and setup at page before change
[13:53:31] <johnbender> yarp
[13:53:39] <johnbender> I like it
[13:53:43] <arschmitz> cool me too
[13:53:48] <johnbender> just watch out for the 1px scroll timing
[13:53:53] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:54:06] <johnbender> arschmitz: well thought out sir!
[13:54:10] <johnbender> *thought-out
[13:54:16] <arschmitz> johnbender: thankyou
[13:54:47] <arschmitz> to avoide the scroll timeing im thinking basicly do .one('pagechange',....
[13:54:52] <arschmitz> and do the actual scroll there
[13:55:03] <arschmitz> then its after everything is completely done
[13:55:29] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jhogervorst opened issue #5547: `textVisible` loader option is inadequately named/documented  02http://git.io/ZVyYwg
[13:55:50] <arschmitz> johnbender: because the 1px scroll is at pageshow
[13:56:12] <johnbender> arschmitz: nice
[13:56:24] <johnbender> couldn't recall the timing there but that sounds sane to me
[13:57:04] <arschmitz> johnbender: cool ill run it by toddmparker: but i think this will be the way to go
[13:58:05] <arschmitz> johnbender: i love the idea of handleing it by not handleing it at all ha ha yet still supporting it in essence 
[13:58:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: I think that it fits with the spirit of PE too
[13:58:32] <johnbender> and ui-state is horrible
[13:58:35] <arschmitz> absolutely 
[13:58:45] <arschmitz> yeah i hate the states i wanted to avoide that
[14:00:13] <arschmitz> johnbender: find out if your going to be able to make it to portland yet?
[14:00:20] <johnbender> arschmitz: didn't ask yet
[14:00:29] <johnbender> arschmitz: hmm june
[14:01:00] <arschmitz> johnbender: its funny i live in portland yet will have to fly to the exact oppisite side of the country to get to portland ha ha
[14:01:03] <johnbender> arschmitz: seems unlikely though since her parents will be on sebatical in europe at that point I think
[14:01:21] <johnbender> and most of the time her mother comes out to help 
[14:01:34] <arschmitz> johnbender: oh bummer every one missed you at the summit too
[14:01:42] <johnbender> I missed me at the summit
[14:01:45] <johnbender> it would have been fun
[14:01:50] <arschmitz> it was
[14:01:52] <johnbender> too close to jsconf though
[14:02:04] <arschmitz> yeah makes it rough
[14:02:50] <arschmitz> your the stranger that most of the team has never met ol
[14:04:10] <arschmitz> johnbender: your picture even fits the part all cloaked in your hoody lol 
[14:04:28] <johnbender> meh you're all better off anyway
[14:05:44] <arschmitz> johnbender: lol iv met you before though
[14:05:59] <johnbender> arschmitz: I remember you saying that but I don't recall when?
[14:06:09] * johnbender hopes that isn't too offensive
[14:06:11] <arschmitz> few years ago a jquery Boston
[14:06:14] <johnbender> ah
[14:06:18] <johnbender> that whole thing was a blur
[14:06:25] <arschmitz> no not at all i never would have expected you too
[14:06:37] <johnbender> crappy presentation, being paired up against paul irish
[14:06:39] <arschmitz> it was very brief
[14:06:51] <arschmitz> lol 
[14:06:59] <arschmitz> Paul is tough compitition
[14:07:21] <arschmitz> you also had the keynote one with todd
[14:07:37] <arschmitz> about mobile right before 1.0
[14:08:57] <arschmitz> johnbender: gota run though have fun with phantom! need to make the ups store before they close
[14:17:16] <johnbender> gseguin: hows your 1.4 conversion coming?
[14:17:30] <johnbender> I'm wondering if a grunt-qunit upgrade wouldn't fix this
[14:17:42] <gseguin> pretty good
[14:17:53] <gseguin> not working on it today though johnbender 
[14:18:11] <gseguin> I have a PR going to grunt-zip soon
[14:18:24] <gseguin> I got build of js/css and zip going
[14:18:57] <gseguin> left is demos and testswarm (not too excited 'bout that last one)
[14:19:22] <gseguin> tests are sort of running but I've got a lot of red and timeouts
[14:19:37] <gseguin> haven't looked into it too closely though
[14:19:48] <gseguin> got sourcemap as a bonus
[14:22:13] <johnbender> gseguin: testswarm hasn't worked yet, don't waste you time 
[14:22:20] <johnbender> gseguin: unless you want to really dive into it
[14:22:27] <johnbender> it's not a prereq for completing that task
[14:22:51] <gseguin> ok cool then I would say we're 65% complete
[14:23:25] <gseguin> thing is, right now we have a lot of denpendencies on git repos as opposed to official npm releases
[14:23:50] <gseguin> because a lot of plugins haven't published their upgrade to grunt 0.4
[14:24:55] <johnbender> gseguin: bummer :/
[14:25:32] <gseguin> johnbender: that's ok, as soon as they publish we just have to change the package.json
[14:25:40] <johnbender> gseguin: phantom is loading the grunt qunit injected script too early
[14:25:42] <johnbender> so no worries
[14:25:47] <johnbender> just need to figure out what to do about that
[14:25:53] <gseguin> johnbender: checkout the branch
[14:25:56] <johnbender> I should say it's loadin it earlier than it has in the past
[14:25:57] <gseguin> I pushed this morning
[14:26:00] <johnbender> kk
[14:26:12] <gseguin> it's been simplified a lot
[14:26:32] <gseguin> the only thing left from our custom tasks is the git sha extraction task
[14:36:43] <johnbender> jzaefferer: are you lurking?
[14:37:30] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I have a question about the latest phantom and grunt-qunit (specifically the order in which the grunt-qunit js gets injected)
[14:56:22] <toddmparker> TP here
[15:05:26] <gseguin> johnbender: if you look at the grunt-0.4 branch you'll see that a lot of tests are actually passing
[15:05:42] <gseguin> johnbender: file:// tests that is
[15:06:08] <gseguin> I split them in 2
[15:19:49] <johnbender> gseguin: super nice
