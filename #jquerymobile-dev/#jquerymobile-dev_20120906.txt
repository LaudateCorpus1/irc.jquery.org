[00:10:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Readme: updates JSBin template to use core 1.8.1 - Jasper de Groot
[00:27:24] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Good morning!
[00:27:35] <uGoMobi> good morning MauriceG
[00:28:30] <MauriceG> If you have one moment ...  I took another look into the header/content/footer corners in popups
[00:30:12] <uGoMobi> sure
[00:30:48] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: the same fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/bwCsm/
[00:32:49] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: that looks good!
[00:33:26] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: but it's not a lightweight ...
[00:33:35] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: we would have to test a bit more to check for edge cases
[00:33:46] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yeah, I see that
[00:34:52] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: don't know if it's worth.  But I would prefer a CSS solution.
[00:35:17] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yes if we fix this it should be with CSS
[00:36:07] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I have to check if the unprefixed border-radius property is already supported by the major browsers
[00:37:16] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Safari 5.1.7: It is.
[00:37:22] <uGoMobi> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/border-radius
[00:38:54] <uGoMobi> we could probably drop the prefixed properties
[00:39:18] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: there I'm ...
[00:39:27] <uGoMobi> not sure about the mobile browsers though
[00:42:55] <uGoMobi> http://caniuse.com/border-radius
[00:43:58] <uGoMobi> saves us some lines if we can remove the prefixed properties in the theme CSS
[00:45:32] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Yes indeed. But only this Opera does not support it ...
[00:46:26] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I think Opera used the unprefixed border-radius from the beginning
[00:47:46] <uGoMobi> I don't remember I ever used -o-border-radius
[00:48:27] <MauriceG> Opera mini does not support it, or?
[00:49:30] <uGoMobi> Opera Mini doesn't support border-radius at all if remember correctly
[00:49:48] <uGoMobi> so that makes no difference
[00:50:59] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Yes, u r right.  And there was never an -o- prefix for it.
[00:54:01] <uGoMobi> I see android 2.1 and iOS 3.2 need the webkit prefix :(
[00:55:48] <uGoMobi> but we could remove -moz if you ask me
[00:56:10] <uGoMobi> todd_ ^^
[01:03:51] <uGoMobi> ?tell todd_: on this page http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/ it says "jQuery Mobile 1.1.0 Supported Platforms" instead of 1.1.1. and there is a typo in "Firebox Mobile (10 Beta)"
[01:03:51] <bot-t> uGoMobi, Okay.
[01:11:35] <uGoMobi> Added the Platforms page to the release checklist wiki page

[04:48:02] <_|Nix|_> Dang! I was able to reproduce the jumping popup issue on my iPod Touch ... once, and then never again :(
[05:01:36] <_|Nix|_> OK ... it seems to happen if you open the popup as soon as the page appears. If you allow the page time to settle, the popup doesn't jump away.
[05:03:57] <_|Nix|_> So, 1. Go to jquerymobile.com/test -> Pages & Dialogs -> Popups; 2. Count to 13 using the Mississippi system. 3. Click on the button that launches the basic popup.
[05:06:24] <_|Nix|_> I noticed that about a second after popup/index.html appears, the colour of the page background changes slightly (presumably the final touches of the initial page render). If I wait until after that, the jump doesn't happen.
[05:16:03] <_|Nix|_> Of course, I can't actually reproduce if I don't wait those 13 seconds, because on my iPod Touch I have to scroll to get to the basic popup.
[05:16:38] <_|Nix|_> However, on my local copy I have modified the pages along the navigation path to have the relevant links at the top of the page, so I can reliably reproduce the issue.
[05:19:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[05:21:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just noticed the 1x jitter in the fixed header of the popup/index.html page on iOS 5.1.1 ...
[05:21:13] <_|Nix|_> s/1x/1px/
[06:11:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong!
[06:11:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I have seen it too on several mobile browsers
[06:13:13] <uGoMobi> I thought we could land a fix for it in beta but need to give it some more thoughts because the fix causes an issue on desktop browsers
[06:17:36] <uGoMobi> be back later
[06:21:03] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[07:41:25] <gseguin> good mornin'
[07:47:30] <_|Nix|_> *wave*
[08:05:39] <todd_> morning!
[08:05:39] <bot-t> (7 hours 1 min 40 secs ago) <uGoMobi> tell todd_: on this page http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/ it says "jQuery Mobile 1.1.0 Supported Platforms" instead of 1.1.1. and there is a typo in "Firebox Mobile (10 Beta)"
[08:05:42] <todd_> hrm: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4946
[08:07:17] <todd_> MauriceG: that popup bin looks great
[08:09:24] <todd_> uGoMobi: i'll fix that GBS page
[08:10:17] <todd_> fixed
[09:00:32] <Wilto> What’s the haps, guys? Am I missing anything?
[09:00:50] <johnbender> I'm not feeling super duper hot today guys
[09:00:53] <johnbender> I think I got a head cold
[09:00:58] <johnbender> I'll be in and out
[09:01:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Get well soon!
[09:02:06] <johnbender> thanks
[09:02:19] <johnbender> sucks because I'm flying solo with my daughter until next tuesday
[09:14:34] <MauriceG> johnbender: :-/  Get well soon!  How old is your daughter?
[09:14:50] <johnbender> 15 months
[09:15:09] <MauriceG> uaahh ...  sorry ...
[09:15:34] <johnbender> hah, she's pretty great though
[09:15:46] <MauriceG> I think she needs a lot  of time
[09:15:48] <johnbender> she can entertain herself for long periods and doesn't wine about much if anything
[09:16:01] <MauriceG> that's cool !
[09:16:18] <MauriceG> lucky johnbender
[09:16:29] <johnbender> I know it :)
[09:18:27] <gseguin> You can code and babysit!?! Wow that is skill right there johnbender!
[09:20:41] <gseguin> When I'm done (label1) reading Cinderella 3 times I have to read the Aristocats 3 times. GOTO label1
[09:21:03] <johnbender> gseguin: no, lol
[09:21:05] <johnbender> gseguin: daycare
[09:21:18] <gseguin> oh ok
[09:21:47] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Teletubbies here, and lots of youtube ...
[09:22:34] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think I've seen more kids sliding into ballpits and backyard inflatable pools in the last three months than the rest of my life.
[09:23:00] <gseguin> heh :)
[09:23:02] <MauriceG> Teletubbies there also?  I'm happy that this time is over ...
[09:56:37] <todd_> feel better johnbender
[09:56:45] <todd_> oh, we have our meeting today
[09:56:47] <todd_> woo hoo
[10:01:35] <agcolom> todd_: hi :-) I just noticed the http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/ needs more corrections I think...
[10:03:38] <agcolom> johnbender: Sorry to hear :-( hope you get better soon too.... My trick is Vitamin C and Zinc... and plenty of sleep.... so I hope your daughter will let you get that :-)
[10:05:55] <agcolom> todd_: as Jasper mentioned this morning, there is still Firebox and FFdesktop only goes to 9...
[10:13:02] <todd_> agcolom: maybe that whole page just needs to be updated against the blog post from 1.1.1, huh?
[10:13:47] <agcolom> todd_: that is the feeling I got... I looked this morning and the page's last update was April
[10:14:50] <agcolom> I'll go cook something for the kids... and I'll be back...
[10:26:30] <todd_> ok
[10:26:34] <todd_> _|Nix|_: you here?
[10:26:57] <todd_> we just got another issue on the popup moving
[10:26:57] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4949
[10:27:04] <todd_> for custom selects, but the same issue
[10:27:16] <todd_> did MauriceG make an issue for that or just mention it here
[10:29:15] <MauriceG> todd_: sorry, you mean the header/content/footer corners issue in popups ?
[10:32:34] <MauriceG> err .. you mean the popup issue, todd_ ?
[10:33:08] <MauriceG> No, I don't make an issue for it ...
[10:36:13] <MauriceG> .. but now we've one well worded
[10:38:36] <todd_> hi all - agenda here
[10:38:37] <todd_> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MJ5-RXgR4bfFLzb49mNvUi85LKphJgVeGhCvLJnXqO4/edit#
[10:38:51] <todd_> MauriceG: yeah, that's the one we'll use
[10:38:57] <todd_> just didn't want a dupe
[10:39:15] <todd_> MauriceG: feel free to add your updates to that doc
[10:39:22] <todd_> I added a section for you
[10:40:51] <todd_> meeting in 20
[10:41:53] <MauriceG> todd_:  oh, my name is right written !
[10:50:45] <uGoMobi> will iOS6 be available for current generation iPod Touch? want to buy one for testing
[10:50:59] <uGoMobi> Wilto: do you know ? ^^
[10:51:00] <todd_> uGoMobi: I think so, yes
[10:51:06] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[10:55:18] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: I know, it's double of price but: iPod is slow and small.  Think about an iPad 2 ...
[10:56:48] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: thanks, iPad 3 is also on my list, maybe buy it when in the USA in october
[10:56:55] <uGoMobi> not sure yet
[10:57:37] <uGoMobi> thought I could use iPod to see how it looks on iPhone as well
[10:57:54] <uGoMobi> but you are right, performance is important part of testing
[10:58:15] <uGoMobi> can't afford all :(
[10:59:06] <uGoMobi> maybe look for a used one
[11:01:11] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Yes!  And the iPhone (4S) is much faster than the iPod
[11:01:23] <todd_> meeting time!
[11:15:25] <Wilto> What’d I do?
[11:15:27] <Wilto> MEETINGS
[11:28:03] <johnbender> todd_: looks lik 4946 might be an event timing issue with core
[11:28:04] <johnbender> not sure though
[11:51:39] <gseguin> Wilto: http://jsbin.com/edecad/30 is my attempt at reproducing the issue we have
[11:51:49] <gseguin> but it works there
[11:52:15] <gseguin> in our case once you've gone to page2 and are back to page1
[11:52:21] <gseguin> if you click on menu
[11:52:29] <gseguin> and then dismiss it
[11:52:46] <gseguin> page1 transitions to itself
[11:52:55] <gseguin> and you end up on a gray screen

[12:12:11] <uGoMobi> johnbender: can you configure Jenkins email adress or should we ask gnarf ? notifications don't make it true my spam filter
[12:12:33] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I can only configure who it goes to I believe
[12:12:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: does it need a reply address?
[12:12:52] <_|Nix|_> todd_: Are we having any kind of voice follow-up? If not, I'll head home.
[12:13:00] <todd_> feels good to re-triage issues
[12:13:05] <todd_> 1.2.0 feels more manageable
[12:13:15] <_|Nix|_> todd_: +1
[12:13:25] <uGoMobi> johnbender: It just says "address not configured" as sender
[12:13:41] <uGoMobi> or something like that
[12:13:53] <todd_> _|Nix|_: think there's not time today
[12:14:07] <_|Nix|_> todd_: OK. In that case, /me go home ...
[12:14:12] <_|Nix|_> L8R all!
[12:14:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi: changed
[12:14:17] <todd_> i do want to keep refining this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USu6OD7JrDJMURG_tyCvAcI4-80l9sqeH0ZZ8dwT2es/edit#
[12:14:20] <todd_> later _|Nix|_
[12:14:21] <uGoMobi> good night _|Nix|_
[12:14:23] <johnbender> should be jenkins@swarm.jquery.org
[12:14:58] <uGoMobi> johnbender: cool, thanks! will check if I receive them now
[12:18:46] <uGoMobi> todd_: did you see my chat with MauriceG today about border-radius? I think we can remove the -moz prefixed rules from the code
[12:19:20] <uGoMobi> although I am still not sure about what Firefox Mobile browsers are out there besides Firefox for Android
[12:19:55] <uGoMobi> so didn't check if any of those need the prefix
[12:27:43] <johnbender> todd_: hmm, I thought we handled this case
[12:27:47] <johnbender> now I'm not that sure :/
[12:30:08] <johnbender> todd_: nevermind it works fine
[12:30:15] <johnbender> hmm
[12:30:18] <johnbender> need to ask for a test case
[12:41:47] <Wilto> WE HAVE A HORIZONTAL SCROLLBAR SIGHTING STOP EVERYTHING
[12:43:17] <Wilto> False alarm. Carry on.
[12:46:22] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[12:46:52] <Wilto> This is the coolest jQM-powered thing I have seen, I think: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit
[12:53:31] <gseguin> That's really cool!
[13:45:02] <todd_> johnbender: so re: -moz-border-radius
[13:45:21] <todd_> dropping because FF desktop/mobile supports non-prefixed version?
[13:46:07] <johnbender> jrburke: I think that uGoMobi posed that question
[13:46:09] <johnbender> err
[13:46:13] <johnbender> todd_: ^
[13:46:24] <johnbender> jrburke: not at all sure how I higlighted your there, sorry
[13:46:30] <todd_> yeah?
[13:46:46] <todd_> for some reason, people's comments show in the wrong pace on my irc client
[13:47:19] <todd_> confusing to say the least
[13:47:33] <todd_> johnbender: see that PG dialog guy wrote back
[13:47:34] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4946#issuecomment-8346512
[13:47:42] <johnbender> todd_: yah I just saw it
[13:50:14] <johnbender> todd_: not sure what to make of it
[13:51:06] <johnbender> todd_: trying to find my phonegap phone/app so I can try my jsbin

[18:08:41] <deltaoo> is there a JQM tab solution
[18:24:12] <deltaoo> anyone here ?
