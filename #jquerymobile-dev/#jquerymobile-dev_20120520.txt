[03:27:32] <agcolom> Hi Jasper,
[03:28:30] <agcolom> quick question... on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3721 my personal view is that it is not a good idea to have 2 buttons with the same name.... what do you think?
[03:28:30] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3721 on jquery-mobile (jsm174; 2m, 2w ago): Multiple buttons with type=submit and same name, serialize incorrectly on second submit
[03:28:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne
[03:29:58] <uGoMobi> reading the issue now
[03:33:39] <agcolom> uGoMobi: sorry, have to let my daughter use my laptop to practice for her guitar exam this afternoon...
[03:34:09] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok
[03:34:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: discuss it later
[03:34:32] <agcolom> ok thanks...
[04:46:19] <MauriceG> hi all
[04:50:40] <agcolom> Hi Maurice :-)
[04:50:55] <MauriceG> Hi Anne :-)
[04:51:11] <agcolom> How are you?
[04:53:00] <MauriceG> Thanks! I'm fine!  And how are you? Today another 2km swim marathon in the Thames ;-)
[04:58:14] <agcolom> I wish ;-) I have to take my daughter to her Guitar Grade 3 exam... It's in Greenwich (in the royal naval college) which is nice as long as it doen't rain!!!
[04:58:50] <agcolom> I've been a bit too tired this week... maybe one evening next week would be nice...
[04:59:57] <agcolom> Are you doing anything nice? BTW I am very happy with the php page you fixed and added to. It's really nice.
[05:02:10] <MauriceG> Oh thanks! Altough that page is a little bit hidden ...
[05:02:36] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi!
[05:02:54] <agcolom> yes, I think I'm going to add it to the search page. I'll check with toddparker first...
[05:02:56] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: hi MauriceG!
[05:03:18] <MauriceG> Anne: Ok thank you!
[05:04:32] <MauriceG> Anne, uGoMobi: So, I have you both here :-), i would like to make a suggestion about another inconsistency in the docs.
[05:05:49] <agcolom> go ahead
[05:08:07] <MauriceG> I mean the swatch letters. On one page there are written as A,B,C. Sometimes there called "theme" sometimes "swatch" and so on.
[05:08:29] <uGoMobi> good point
[05:09:16] <MauriceG> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-themes.html says: A swatch
[05:09:39] <MauriceG> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-themes.html says; A swatch AND "a" theme ...
[05:09:55] <MauriceG> there is no A theme ...
[05:10:08] <agcolom> yes, I have to go through everything for 1.2 to change the code indentation. But I must wait until we are nearly ready to release 1.2, so I could do that at the same time to avoid too many PRs.
[05:10:17] <uGoMobi> but there is an A-team ;-)
[05:10:43] <MauriceG> yes! I forgot! The A-team :-)
[05:11:27] <agcolom> I can't get started now because the new indentation will only be for 1.2 and if other changes are made it will cause git conflicts
[05:11:30] <uGoMobi> related to that; we use terms like "button swatch" on that theming list page. Is that clear to people or should we say "button class of theme/swatch..."
[05:11:38] <agcolom> definitely the A-team I agree ;-)
[05:15:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I looked at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3721
[05:15:11] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3721 on jquery-mobile (jsm174; 2m, 2w ago): Multiple buttons with type=submit and same name, serialize incorrectly on second submit
[05:16:11] <uGoMobi> Two buttons using same name attribute should not be a problem
[05:16:31] <agcolom> I like swatch "b" or "b" swatch, unless we talk about a theme...
[05:16:40] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes?
[05:17:02] <agcolom> What did you think?
[05:17:48] <uGoMobi> well if I understand that user right, the issue is that span with input type hidden that is added by framework
[05:17:53] <agcolom> Maybe we can split those pages when we come to it if you fancy doing some of the changes, depending on your workloads
[05:18:32] <MauriceG> Anne: Yes. a,b,c, and so on are swatches and no themes.  (Valencia is a theme ...)
[05:18:50] <uGoMobi> I agree we should use swatch
[05:19:12] <uGoMobi> so it's confusing when we say... silver in the default theme
[05:19:18] <uGoMobi> it's not
[05:19:21] <uGoMobi> typo
[05:19:44] <MauriceG> and "a", "b" ...   a swatch like "A" will not work ...
[05:22:05] <agcolom> I would say a is the exception. Theme a is not the same as swatch a
[05:22:56] <agcolom> Theme a is the theme with highest level of contrast, which consists of swatch a or header and footer bars, and swatch c for content
[05:24:44] <uGoMobi> What is theme "a"? themes are "default", "valencia" or your own custom theme
[05:25:21] <MauriceG> yes. There is no theme a.
[05:25:32] <MauriceG> just a data-theme a
[05:25:48] <uGoMobi> which refers to swatch "a"
[05:26:22] <uGoMobi> in other words... a theme is a combination of swatches
[05:26:25] <MauriceG> so:  data-swatch=a   would be the right attribute ;-)
[05:26:36] <uGoMobi> haha, actually yes
[05:28:13] <agcolom> yes a theme is a combination of swatches is my understanding, so they mean different things
[05:28:21] <uGoMobi> yes
[05:28:56] <uGoMobi> and Maurice is right that we don't use those terms correctly everywhere
[05:29:09] <agcolom> ok, so we need to review this
[05:30:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: how do you edit docs? online on Github or on local repo?
[05:33:02] <agcolom> I edit online on GitHub, then pull latest version on my local machine, cherry-pick the new commit into 1.1-stable and push 1.1-stable
[05:33:29] <uGoMobi> I see
[05:34:37] <agcolom> editing is the easy bit... the cherry-picking can be a nightmare as sometimes leads to conflicts, for example when someone has made a change and forgot to cherry-pick or if there is in the same file a change for master and 1.1-stable and another change for master and 1.2 but not 1.1-stable
[05:35:08] <uGoMobi> I understand, commits have to be picked in order
[05:35:18] <agcolom> now each committer is responsible for cherry-picking his/her commits, including pulled in PRs
[05:35:57] <uGoMobi> I was just thinking about easiest way to make those consistency changes
[05:36:43] <agcolom> I have to review all the files for 1.2 to correct the indentation, so I think the easiest will be to do all in one go then.
[05:36:58] <agcolom> It will save a lot of time
[05:37:08] <agcolom> and stress ;-)
[05:37:30] <agcolom> The aim will be to make all the changes in one week, the week before 1.2 is released.
[05:37:34] <uGoMobi> I do it local in a branch, using Dreamweaver to walk true the docs with search/replace and regular expressions to narrow the search
[05:38:07] <uGoMobi> that goes very fast
[05:39:08] <agcolom> yes, but in this case it will be a good opportunity for me to read carefully as well, and ensure all the pages are written in the same voice.
[05:39:25] <uGoMobi> that's very true
[05:40:24] <agcolom> For example I will change popup docs but want to have a word with Gabriel first to make sure he's ok about it.
[05:40:45] <agcolom> It uses second person and not passive form
[05:41:10] <uGoMobi> I understand
[05:41:30] <MauriceG> Anne: but this is often in the docs ...
[05:41:38] <agcolom> what is ?
[05:41:51] <agcolom> second person?
[05:42:16] <MauriceG> If I get you right, yes.
[05:44:03] <agcolom> yes, sometimes I suppose it is harder than others, but that page for example really stands out when reading.
[05:44:14] <agcolom> For example also that page says: "To turn any div into a popup, add the data-role="popup" attribute to the div."
[05:44:50] <agcolom> other pages would say "Any div can be turned into a popup by adding the data-role="popup" attribute to that div"
[05:45:39] <agcolom> I'm in favour of the second option. Sometimes it is still ok to have second person mentioned, but it all depends on the sentence and it's position in the pararaph.
[05:46:31] <MauriceG> theming buttons: "Query Mobile has a rich theming system that gives you full control ..."
[05:47:39] <agcolom> yes, that's ok, just like "If you would like the popup to appear when the user clicks on a link, create a link such that its href attribute is set to the id of the popup, and the link has the attribute data-rel="popup". " is also ok. it all depends on the sentence and how it reads
[05:53:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: about that issue again... two buttons with same name attribute shouldn't be a problem
[05:53:19] <agcolom> yep
[05:53:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that span with input type hidden gets added by the framework on purpose
[05:53:40] <agcolom> ok
[05:53:46] <uGoMobi> but I don't know why exactly
[05:54:04] <uGoMobi> thats a question for gseguin or johnbender i think
[05:54:11] <agcolom> no idea. Would the same happen if you had 2 buttons but with a different name?
[05:54:18] <uGoMobi> yes
[05:54:30] <agcolom> ok. Let's put that to them then, thanks,
[05:54:38] <uGoMobi> one more thing...
[05:54:44] <agcolom> yes
[05:55:02] <uGoMobi> that user doesn't make clear what actually is the problem
[05:55:31] <uGoMobi> does he/she just don't like that added span or is it causing a problem?
[05:55:47] <agcolom> I created a jsfiddle and reproduced the problem, but I forgot to submit my comment at the time...
[05:55:55] <uGoMobi> it only says it's a problem when trying to remove it
[05:56:45] <agcolom> ok.
[05:56:51] <uGoMobi> but lets ask the west coast guys first about the reason why the framework has that function in the button widget that creates that span input type hidden
[05:58:24] <agcolom> yes, good idea. Usually things are there for a reason ;-)
[05:58:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4410#issuecomment-5807829
[05:58:51] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4410 on jquery-mobile (dwong1234; 7h, 13m ago): Footer navbar moves up when clicking on a textbox in an Android environment
[05:59:53] <uGoMobi> reason that I didn't ask for fiddle was because he said it is with phonegap.... my question: can phonegap issues be reproduces with a jsfiddle?
[06:00:10] <uGoMobi> I don't really know phonegap
[06:03:21] <agcolom> no I think it's like with iOS webpanels, the wrappers can have effects that cannot be reproduced without
[06:06:04] <agcolom> ok, I'm off to Greenwich... Speak later and have a nice sunday...
[06:06:21] <uGoMobi> thanks, you too
[06:07:16] <MauriceG> thanks! be careful :-)
[06:07:23] <agcolom> I will :-)
[06:08:42] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I have a fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2425
[06:08:43] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2425 on jquery-mobile (DreifGenov; 8m, 1w ago): Second navbar on a page doesn't get active state for the second time
[06:09:24] <uGoMobi> just in case you were still looking into that
[06:10:57] <MauriceG> no, thanks...  you mean the ui-state-persists attribute for navbar buttons?
[06:12:40] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yes
[06:12:52] <uGoMobi> active class is getting removed
[06:13:19] <MauriceG> I've added a fiddle there to test with to navbars.
[06:13:37] <MauriceG> type: to := two ...
[06:14:22] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw
[06:15:25] <MauriceG> so it works and could be closed, or?
[06:16:09] <uGoMobi> no I will make a PR now
[06:16:21] <uGoMobi> close after that got merged
[06:17:23] <uGoMobi> my fix is to have the navbar widget adding ui-state-persist to links with ui-btn-active as soon as the navbar get enhanced
[06:17:25] <MauriceG> ok, i will take a look!
[06:18:12] <uGoMobi> simple but effective
[06:18:46] <MauriceG> what means, no ui-state-persist have to be added manually anymore?
[06:19:02] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:19:14] <uGoMobi> not even for persistent footers/headers
[06:19:42] <uGoMobi> just ui-btn-active in markup
[06:20:33] <MauriceG> sounds good and make sense, I think.
[06:20:42] <uGoMobi> :-)
