[07:16:41] <toddmparker> morning
[07:16:52] <toddmparker> gonna be nightly early for you left coast people
[07:17:18] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: when you get online, Forte_ 
[07:17:22] <Forte_> Morning
[07:17:30] <toddmparker> â€¦is here today and we were getting ready to prep the icons
[07:17:49] <toddmparker> thinking we want to generate white and black versions
[07:18:10] <toddmparker> if so, do we namespace each icon like icon-arrow-l-white
[07:18:17] <toddmparker> -black
[07:18:48] <toddmparker> also, should we process these, then merge both black and white into a single icons.css?
[07:19:00] <toddmparker> â€¦or should be merge, then just paste it into theme.css?
[07:20:05] <toddmparker> actually, just remembered that we need to use a loader for the svgs to handle fallbacksâ€¦see this page: view-source:http://filamentgroup.github.io/grunticon/example/output/preview.html
[07:20:15] <toddmparker> so we need to think about how to manage that
[08:05:32] <Wilto> Who missed me?
[08:06:52] <toddmparker> { crickets }
[08:07:09] <Wilto> FINE you guys WHATEVER

[09:25:45] <toddmparker> how goes?
[09:25:47] <Forte_> Hello
[09:25:59] <uGoMobi> all well here
[09:26:06] <toddmparker> how was the trip?
[09:26:48] <uGoMobi> 15 hrs + delay + bomb scare at PDX so no public transport / cab 
[09:26:55] <uGoMobi> :)
[09:27:01] <toddmparker> ugh.
[09:27:07] <toddmparker> so real easy
[09:27:16] <uGoMobi> yup
[09:27:25] <uGoMobi> you guys looking at grunticon
[09:27:26] <uGoMobi> ?
[09:27:29] <toddmparker> pacific northwest is worth it.
[09:27:33] <toddmparker> yep
[09:27:45] <uGoMobi> yeah, looks nice here
[09:27:50] <toddmparker> Forte_ created a full black and white set
[09:27:57] <toddmparker> ran it thru grunticon
[09:27:58] <uGoMobi> great
[09:28:10] <Forte_> Getting a pull request ready atm
[09:28:16] <toddmparker> I had a few Q's above I wanted you to weight in on
[09:28:27] <toddmparker> for now, we tacked the color at the end of each icon
[09:28:37] <uGoMobi> we are about to start here, but I will read back

[09:58:03] <gseguin> jzaefferer: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin
[10:02:03] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Forte_ : I think using the color in the icon class name is best
[10:02:16] <uGoMobi> means we have to drop the ui-icon-alt feature
[10:02:55] <uGoMobi> I think we should merge it in theme CSS, not a separate icon CSS fil
[10:02:58] <uGoMobi> file*
[10:06:25] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i agree with merging, but the wrinkle is the fallbacks
[10:06:36] <jzaefferer> gseguin: git job running on new jenkins server, commit hook is updated: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Git/
[10:06:43] <toddmparker> we load one of 3 stylesheets, depending on whether you support svg or not
[10:06:49] <toddmparker> and data-uri's or not
[10:07:20] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ah ok, gotcha
[10:07:36] <toddmparker> I can loop in scottjehl__ 
[10:07:42] <toddmparker> he had some ideas...
[10:08:08] <uGoMobi> yeah, would be great 
[10:08:16] <danielvdende> uGoMobi: hi, have you had a chance yet to discuss our proposal with any other team members?
[10:08:32] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: no sorry, not yet
[10:08:53] <danielvdende> uGoMobi: ok, no problem :)
[10:15:18] <scottjehl__> hi
[10:15:35] <toddmparker> hey scottjehl__ 
[10:16:03] <scottjehl__> talking about ideas for loading grunticon?
[10:17:17] <scottjehl__> first off, the logic for deciding whether to load the css w/data svg uris, css w/ data png uris, or css w/ exernal pngs is here:
[10:17:18] <scottjehl__> https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon/blob/master/tasks/grunticon/static/grunticon.loader.js
[10:17:44] <scottjehl__> I'm guessing we'll want to have a similar component in jQM, though it could be refactored of course.
[10:18:11] <scottjehl__> basic point here is to make a single async request for the appropriate icons
[10:18:57] <scottjehl__> I think for defining the css paths, we might consider some sort of meta tag configuration or something... haven't thought it through much
[10:20:42] <uGoMobi> hey scottjehl__ 
[10:21:11] <toddmparker> yeah, i think the question is how to include these icons with the least amount of fuss, template-wise
[10:23:25] <jzaefferer> gseguin: plugin will be installed after a restart, once the current job finished running
[10:23:37] <gseguin> thanks!
[10:24:38] <scottjehl__> an advantage of using the loader as-is is it has no dependencies
[10:24:58] <scottjehl__> so it could get the icon request out long before jquery finishes loading
[10:25:31] <scottjehl__> but doing that means pasting the js into the head of the page
[10:25:41] <scottjehl__> ideally, to avoid requests
[10:28:00] <scottjehl__> btw, in that pull: I'm not sure if we'll want to include the built files or just the svg assets in the repo. worth discussing
[10:28:20] <scottjehl__> including all those would sort of be like committing our min js and css files
[10:32:29] <toddmparker> yeah, we might have included too much
[10:32:38] <toddmparker> we really just want the output css files and images
[10:32:48] <toddmparker> and the source svg's should go somewhere
[10:33:13] <toddmparker> so if we skip the inline loader, what are the downsides?
[10:35:34] <scottjehl__> that's pretty much all it outputs
[10:35:38] <scottjehl__> but those are build files
[10:35:41] <scottjehl__> built rather
[10:36:09] <scottjehl__> not sure if we should have more than just the source svg files in the repo is what I mean
[10:36:23] <scottjehl__> run grunt locally to generate 
[10:52:05] <toddmparker> be nice to not require people to install and run grunt locally if they aren't generating new icons
[10:52:54] <scottjehl__> agree. just envisioning the merge conflicts for production assets
[10:54:49] <scottjehl__> is it common to clone our dev repository to browse the docs without running grunt? if that's common, I guess it's worth committing them. Maybe it's not a problem I've no idea
[10:55:23] <toddmparker> i was thinking we would just drop in the output files to the repo, so even tho we used grunticon to generate, that wouldn't be front and center. 
[10:55:45] <toddmparker> we could provide the svg sources and instructions somewhere if people wanted to re-generate but that would be outside of the repo
[10:55:59] <toddmparker> just a thought
[10:56:24] <toddmparker> i think it's common enough
[10:56:32] <toddmparker> we also export a zip with releases
[10:57:42] <scottjehl__> yeah. I had figured the zip and the test site were built after running grunt but maybe not
[10:57:58] <scottjehl__> that's fine
[10:58:30] <toddmparker> uGoMobi or gseguin or arschmitz might know better
[10:59:02] <scottjehl__> up to you guys. just figured i'd flag it for discussion
[10:59:49] <scottjehl__> after adding or editing icons, we'll need to remember to run grunt and commit the output files
[10:59:59] <toddmparker> right
[11:01:16] <scottjehl__> meeting. later!
