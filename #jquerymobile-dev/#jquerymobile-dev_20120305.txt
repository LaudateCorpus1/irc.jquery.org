[08:17:37] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: I've got some internal todo's then I can jump in on bugs
[08:17:54] <johnbender> anything super super ugly we need to address?
[08:19:24] <Wilto> Nothing has set off any alarms for me recently, no.
[08:19:29] <tbenzige> johnbender: who do i talk to about this https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/80?
[08:19:30] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #80 on web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller, reported by MarkToronto (2d, 18h ago): jQuery Mobile Themeroller not working in IE9/FireFox10.0.2/GoogleChrome
[08:19:35] <Wilto> Think we’re just staying the course on assorted issues.
[08:21:00] <Wilto> Friday I started picking my way through the issue tracker starting with the oldest, just to get the numbers down a bit.
[08:21:22] <Wilto> Oh. We do kinda have a big issue, but it likely bears further discussion when Todd and Scott are back on the grid.
[08:22:05] <Wilto> People are none-too-psyched about not providing a way to get to the old and busted transitions—slide, in particular.
[08:26:52] <johnbender> Wilto: and also falling back to a non fluid toolbar
[08:27:47] <Wilto> I’m less worried about that one, but yeah… and either way, I’m not saying those _should_ be made available, necessarily.
[08:27:50] <johnbender> tbenzige: dunno about that
[08:28:00] <Wilto> Hard to know where The Line is on this stuff.
[08:28:59] <johnbender> tbenzige: maybe robots.txt?
[08:29:04] <johnbender> to prevent indexing?
[08:29:17] <tbenzige> johnbender: i don't know much about SEO. any idea why the link for themeroller has a random get parameter?
[08:34:17] <johnbender> tbenzige: it's probably been linked online somehwere on a blog or forum
[08:34:21] <johnbender> and maybe shared around
[08:34:36] <johnbender> tbenzige: keep in mind that's mostly speculation
[08:34:49] <johnbender> and I'm not sure if you can restrict get params in robots.txt
[08:34:49] <tbenzige> yeah. its just odd that THAT url is more common than the normal
[08:35:27] <tbenzige> is it any good to use <link rel="canonical" href=".."/>?
[08:35:41] <johnbender> no clue
[08:36:04] <johnbender> I guess this is one good reason to use the actual url for resources like shared styles
[08:36:19] <johnbender> it doesn't look like you can restrict params in robots.txt
[08:36:19] <johnbender> :(
[08:36:26] <tbenzige> yeah
[08:36:35] <tbenzige> i found this: http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html
[08:37:17] <johnbender> yah just stumbled on that myself
[08:37:53] <johnbender> cool
[08:37:57] <johnbender> hopefully that helps
[08:38:02] <johnbender> seems like it should
[08:38:21] <tbenzige> alright. ill give it a shot. thanks

[09:07:43] <johnbender> Wilto: branches preview is rocking
[09:07:51] <Wilto> aww sheeit
[09:07:53] <johnbender> I'm going to turn it into a jenkins build probably today or tomorrow
[09:08:29] <Wilto> Whassat do?
[09:08:38] <Wilto> We’ll get a notification in here if the branches go down?
[09:10:22] <johnbender> Wilto: that's the idea
[09:10:27] <johnbender> or at least we can do that if we want
[09:10:28] <Wilto> Sweet.
[09:10:44] <Wilto> Maybe we could set it up to just chime in if they break.
[09:10:47] <johnbender> I also want to move our deployment to the cdn out of apache's hands
[09:10:51] <johnbender> Wilto: yep
[09:10:59] <johnbender> hmm
[09:11:03] <johnbender> I think I can do that with the other as well
[09:11:17] <johnbender> let me check
[09:11:56] <johnbender> Wilto: ok the latest build is failure and fixed messages only
[09:12:15] <Wilto> Awesome.
[09:14:12] <johnbender> Wilto: I had both of our builds set that way before but when I disable irc notifications to monkey with the build I have to change those settings back manually
[09:16:53] <Wilto> Ahh.
[09:17:02] <Wilto> Is that why Jenkins has been flipping out lately?
[09:17:44] <Wilto> I picture a clockwork robot flailing its springy arms and yelling “everything is fine! Everything is fine!”
[09:17:54] <johnbender> yerp
[09:17:59] <johnbender> Wilto: buildbot
[09:18:05] <johnbender> when the infra gets moved around
[09:18:09] <johnbender> these things will be buildbot
[09:18:18] <johnbender> don't tell anyone :D
[09:19:51] <gseguin> I didin't hear anything
[09:21:07] <Wilto> I know nothing.
[09:22:39] <gseguin> johnbender: look into travis ci though
[09:43:01] <johnbender> gseguin: well for the latest and branches builds that wouldn't make any sense
[09:43:19] <johnbender> gseguin: and the jquerymobile build will use jenkins out of convention (ie, the other projects use it)
[09:43:38] <gseguin> oh yeah yeah, I was more saying before we switched from jenkins for our CI
[09:43:46] <gseguin> we should look at travis
[09:43:50] <johnbender> gseguin: absolutely
[09:43:55] <johnbender> gseguin: it's built on vagrant
[09:43:58] <johnbender> don't know if you knew that :D
[09:44:06] <gseguin> I did not
[09:44:10] * johnbender beams
[09:44:16] <gseguin> very nice!
[09:44:33] <johnbender> I can't wait until the new site comes out (Mitchell is working on it)
[09:44:37] <johnbender> it has a list of corporate users
[09:44:42] <gseguin> I just know that it looks like it's getting good adoption from the community
[09:44:56] <johnbender> gseguin: well
[09:44:59] <johnbender> I'm a fan
[09:45:04] <johnbender> lol
[09:49:04] <Wilto> You guys just made temp02 and bot-t1 feel inadequate.
[11:22:59] <Wilto> Alright. Somewhat predictably, I’m unable to recreate https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3703 on ICS, outside of PhoneGap.
[11:22:59] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3703 on jquery-mobile, reported by uhlenhuthm (4d, 3h ago): GET parameters break $.mobile.changePage - Android 4.03 + JQM 1.1 RC1 + PhoneGap 1.4.1
[11:23:27] <Wilto> I don’t want to be that “not our problem” dude in the issue tracker, buuuut I dunno about this one. johnbender, gseguin: any thoughts?
[12:47:11] <johnbender> Wilto: we have to look into it
[12:47:21] <johnbender> not much choice
[12:47:23] <Wilto> Ah, okay.
[12:47:38] <Wilto> PhoneGap it is.
[12:47:40] <johnbender> that's easy for me to say though since I don't have an ICS phone
[12:49:15] <Wilto> i uh i don’t have one either so NOT IT

[12:51:39] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3088 on jquery-mobile, reported by tor-jorgen (3m, 2w ago): Not possible to enter text on an Android Internet browser
[12:51:43] <Wilto> I should’ve become a mechanic.
[12:53:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think we'll need to have a discussion about superimposing some kind of structure onto the hash ... currently we're making a lot of assumptions ... like, for example, we're assuming that &ui-state=dialog comes after the jqm page ... What if a person opens a dialog from a popup? You close the dialog, and the &ui-state=dialog disappears ... now, when you close the popup, it goes back to the previous page in the browser history
[13:09:18] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yeah that thing needs worked on, are you going to be around on Wed?
