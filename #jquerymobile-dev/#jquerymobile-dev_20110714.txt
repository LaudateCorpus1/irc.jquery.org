[06:50:46] <todd_> thanks _nickel!
[06:50:51] <todd_> taht is really great
[06:51:06] <todd_> will you be at today's meeting?
[08:31:10] <todd_> hi _nickel - you there
[08:48:44] <gseguin> Good morning all
[09:17:56] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[09:18:12] <gseguin> hey toddparker, 'sup?
[09:18:46] <gseguin> what's that about: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/12d52772cbab5f04f0250fda56a135d1a728bdd7#commitcomment-477470 ?
[09:30:03] <gseguin> toddparker: I didn't get an answer regarding the padding at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1847, do you know why it's there?
[09:39:44] <miketaylr> re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/12d52772cbab5f04f0250fda56a135d1a728bdd7#L0R45 python won't like, interpret PHP... unless it does?
[09:40:14] <miketaylr> it's my first day using PHP
[09:42:19] <gseguin> I know very few about Python but I doubt SimpleHTTPServer can do PHP, indeed
[10:19:53] <scottjehl> hey gseguin
[10:20:02] <scottjehl> reviewing your transitions branch now. finally :)
[10:20:13] <scottjehl> had a few questions whenever you have a chance
[10:20:49] <scottjehl> for one: did you try translateX instead of margin? Should be smoother I think... wondering if you ran into trouble with it though...
[10:20:50] <scottjehl> brb
[10:25:34] <gseguin> hey scottjehl, I'm back
[10:42:13] <scottjehl> hey me too
[10:42:16] <scottjehl> :)
[10:42:19] <gseguin> :)
[10:43:38] <gseguin> so I know I gave translateX a try but I think the issue was one of the browser (O or FF) did not play well with transitions on transform
[10:46:25] <scottjehl> k. I wonder if we might consider mix/matching
[10:46:38] <scottjehl> we'll get hardware acceleration with translate in ios at least
[10:47:10] <gseguin> but how would you discriminate ?
[10:47:43] <gseguin> do we need a platform class on the html element?
[10:47:48] <scottjehl> no
[10:47:58] <scottjehl> we've got prefixes there though, right?
[10:48:24] <gseguin> right so you can set a different transition-property per engine
[10:48:35] <gseguin> but then ...
[10:49:12] <scottjehl> and maybe go with translate for the w3 version too
[10:49:21] <gseguin> in the .slide class, how would you do to specify margin for one and transform for the other?
[10:49:46] <miketaylr> can you trigger HW w/ translateX in addition to margin?
[10:49:53] <miketaylr> or Z rather
[10:51:32] <scottjehl> wait what
[10:52:29] <miketaylr> what, you can't interpret my gibberish?
[10:52:35] * miketaylr tries again
[10:52:50] <gseguin> the question is how do you make margin and transform live together in the same rule
[10:53:07] <gseguin> without stepping on each other's feet
[10:53:11] <nimbu> can i participate >_>
[10:53:19] <gseguin> sure!
[10:53:20] <scottjehl> ah right
[10:53:25] <scottjehl> yeah please!
[10:53:28] <nimbu> :)
[10:53:38] <scottjehl> also, what was the issue with using translate across the board?
[10:53:58] <nimbu> scottjehl:  its terribly slow on Opera
[10:54:06] <scottjehl> :(
[10:54:18] <nimbu> what happens with margin?
[10:54:20] <gseguin> I knew there was a reason
[10:54:20] <nimbu> does it not work?
[10:54:38] <scottjehl> not hw accelerated on ios, andoid I think too
[10:54:39] <miketaylr> scottjehl was concerned about lack of HW acceleration on iOS
[10:55:07] <nimbu> scottjehl: yeah i did not notice any significant difference.
[10:55:09] <scottjehl> right, we use translate now and in my experience, that and opacity are much smoother due to hw on ios
[10:55:17] <nimbu> for slide in/out
[10:55:20] <nimbu> opacity yes
[10:55:31] <scottjehl> k
[10:55:38] <scottjehl> I wonder about wider screens
[10:55:40] <scottjehl> ipad
[10:55:48] <nimbu> i think gseguin was testing on it.
[10:55:52] <nimbu> a tablet
[10:55:58] <gseguin> nope
[10:56:02] <gseguin> but I can
[10:56:20] <miketaylr> can't you trigger HW acceleration though, by adding a -webkit-transform: translateZ(0);
[10:56:31] * gseguin testing on iPad now
[10:56:35] <scottjehl> oh, for other props?
[10:56:49] <nimbu> miketaylr: i think h/w acc only works for translate
[10:56:52] <nimbu> and opacity
[10:56:56] <nimbu> or specific properties.
[10:57:01] <miketaylr> oh, ok
[10:57:06] <miketaylr> what do i know
[10:57:13] <miketaylr> i just do whatever twitter tells me
[10:57:13] <scottjehl> I wish that were true
[10:57:29] <scottjehl> we can test it
[10:58:01] <nimbu> i forget. IE h/w accells everything
[10:58:07] <gseguin> yeah, not looking too good on iPad
[10:58:08] <gseguin> :(
[10:58:10] <nimbu> oops
[10:58:13] <nimbu> :|||
[10:58:18] <nimbu> grr.
[10:58:28] <miketaylr> As mentioned earlier, accelerated compositing in WebKit (and Chromium) kicks in only if certain types of content appear on the page. An easy trick to force a page to switch over to the compositor is to supply a -webkit-transform:translateZ(0) for an element in the page.
[10:58:33] <miketaylr> http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/gpu-accelerated-compositing-in-chrome
[10:58:39] <nimbu> oh i see. cool.
[10:58:54] <miketaylr> worth a shot?
[10:59:06] <nimbu> yeah it should be.
[10:59:18] * gseguin is trying it out
[10:59:52] <scottjehl> ooh. that reminds me of a workaround we did to get another portion of our styles into the same rendering pipeline.
[10:59:59] <scottjehl> sounds familiar now :)
[11:00:09] <nimbu> yayyy
[11:00:11] <nimbu> i hope it works.
[11:00:15] <toddparker> sounds promising
[11:00:28] <scottjehl> oh me too. so what's the status of this branch at this point. This question aside?
[11:00:38] <nimbu> i gotta test pop and fade.
[11:00:41] <nimbu> i am def doing it now.
[11:00:45] <toddparker> hey all - we're supposed to have a public team meeting over on #jquery-meeting right now
[11:00:47] <nimbu> it doesnt seem to render well on opera.
[11:00:58] <nimbu> so i promise results by eod today
[11:01:00] <nimbu> either way
[11:01:02] <toddparker> would you  all mind popping over there?
[11:01:49] <scottjehl> thanks nimbu
[11:02:24] <nimbu> gseguin: are you gonna commit the translateZ trick? I can do it too
[11:02:46] <gseguin> nimbu: if it works yes
[11:02:54] <nimbu> kk
[11:02:56] <nimbu> lemme know!
[11:02:56] <miketaylr> nimbu: feel free to /join #jquery-meeting
[11:02:57] <gseguin> I added .animate { -webkit-transform:translateZ(0); }
[11:03:07] <nimbu> i have an ipad too actually
[11:03:09] <nimbu> so i can test.
[11:22:58] <gseguin> _nickel: ping
[11:23:20] <_nickel> gseguin: pong
[11:23:38] <gseguin> are you joining the meeting on #jquery-meeting ?
[11:43:09] <toddparker> hey all
[11:44:24] <gseguin> hey
[11:45:29] <gseguin> scottjehl: can you anwer my question at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1847#issuecomment-1567101 ?
[11:52:29] <RwL> can anyone tell me a little about using ui-icon-alt? the black icons are distributed w/ jQuery mobile and ui-icon-alt styles are provided, but I don't see any usages in the demo site (or find any references in the source besides that CSS)... is there way to specify that a certain swatch should always use ui-icon-alt for components with icons?
[12:08:09] <scottjehl> I think our intention was mostly to provide it as an optional class to apply to generated markup
[12:08:12] <scottjehl> for devs
[12:08:48] <scottjehl> we never ended up using them because the colored disks made the white icons work everywhere
[12:21:22] <scottjehl> I think we'll end up commenting out that rule and noting that you can reference that image in your own stylesheet to target specific selectors if you'd like
[12:23:14] <scottjehl> RwL: does that help?
[12:24:00] <scottjehl> we highly encourage people to write their own HTML and CSS, in other words. The theming aims to provide a good starting point :)
[12:38:00] <scottjehl> so gseguin, are you trying translateX?
[12:38:03] <scottjehl> I can try here
[12:50:53] <RwL> scottjehl: thanks (just returned). I also asked around yesterday about 1) if the icons are available as some other format source files (PSD, etc) and 2) if you make you own, if they really need to be saved as PNG-8 instead of -24
[12:52:33] <RwL> I didn't see the icons in the source on GitHub except for the 8-bit production images in the themes folder
[12:52:45] <scottjehl> they're in illustrator format here yeah
[12:52:48] <scottjehl> we can push those
[12:52:55] <RwL> oh, please do
[12:57:25] <RwL> and any comment on why the production PNGs are PNG-8 instead of PNG-24? Is that just for WinMo 7?
[13:04:12] <gseguin> scottjehl: back now, I can try translateX
[13:04:24] <scottjehl> oh ok cool
[13:04:30] <gseguin> but I still don't see how to make the 2 live together
[13:04:42] <scottjehl> no I think we'd have to skew towards one
[13:04:55] <gseguin> or have a platform class
[13:05:03] <gseguin> which I know you're against
[13:05:15] <scottjehl> I don't think any of us want to support that
[13:05:35] <gseguin> feature class ala modernizr
[13:06:19] <scottjehl> well, if translate means no regression on the current platforms we support, that's quite important, for one
[13:07:10] <scottjehl> also, I feel like Opera is very quick and transparent addressing bug fixes for stuff like this. Whereas I have iOS tickets open for serious issues for 2+ years still
[13:08:04] <miketaylr> just want to say if we're the ones choking here, it doesn't make a lot of sense to make iOS suffer
[13:08:25] <miketaylr> i guess we'll see what magic nimbu can conjure
[13:08:41] <miketaylr> and try to get our shit fixed :)
[13:09:18] <scottjehl> agreed, in broadening our support,  we really can't regress on platforms that already work
[13:09:36] <scottjehl> anyway, maybe we'll find a fix yet :)
[13:09:41] <scottjehl> like you said
[13:10:00] <gseguin> yeah I totally agree, say no to regressions
[13:11:51] <scottjehl> I'll be here whenever you want to test something
[13:12:02] <gseguin> ok doing the changes right now
[13:12:08] <miketaylr> opera tends to move pretty fast when compat is at stake, in terms of fixing things
[13:13:03] <scottjehl> btw - we can do a whitespace and comment cleanup in the process. The jqtouch credit is probably not relevant anymore as far as code overlap goes (though it was great having their code to reference early on).
[13:13:19] <scottjehl> miketaylr - we've noticed. you guys rock it
[13:13:55] <gseguin> scottjehl: will clean up
[13:14:58] <scottjehl> awesome. I think we should do a code style cleanup across all css at some point. I started doing it in theme.css with the new prefixes, but in general, things are inconsistent. my fault mostly
[13:16:07] <gseguin> ok I'll follow you style in theme.css
[13:16:30] <scottjehl> heh. well, I didn't get far a tall
[13:16:34] <scottjehl> at all
[13:16:36] <scottjehl> a tall
[13:16:39] <scottjehl> :)
[13:30:20] <gseguin> scottjehl: FF mobile beta does not look good
[13:30:47] <scottjehl> k.
[13:30:53] <scottjehl> not a regression, but that's a bummer
[13:31:03] <gseguin> yup
[13:31:08] <scottjehl> did it work better with margin?
[13:31:17] <scottjehl> oh can you push that if you have it working?
[13:31:25] <gseguin> I think it did
[13:31:29] <scottjehl> we can help test
[13:31:34] <gseguin> let me stash and double check
[13:31:42] <gseguin> I just have the slide working
[13:31:51] <gseguin> doing the other ones and then pushing
[13:33:05] <scottjehl> k cool thanks
[13:35:06] <miketaylr> surely there's a feature test like if (doesNotLookLikeCrap) {}
[13:36:07] <gseguin> :)
[13:38:47] <scottjehl> if ( /*@cc_on ! @*/ true ){ ... ?
[13:39:36] <scottjehl> aww sorry. IE jokes are outta style these days
[13:42:24] <scottjehl> sidenote, are @cc_on comments being removed along with the other conditionals in IE10?
[13:42:37] <gseguin> no idea
[13:47:31] <miketaylr> hahaha
[13:47:39] <miketaylr> hmm, good question
[13:50:33] <gseguin> scottjehl: I just pushed slide transitions back to transform-property: transform
[14:11:56] <scottjehl> ok thx
[14:27:03] <scottjehl> so, way way smoother
[14:27:23] <scottjehl> it looks like scroll-to-previous-location is not working
[14:27:32] <scottjehl> also, I'm seeing blinks now and then
[14:27:39] <scottjehl> pretty sure they don't show in master
[14:28:01] <scottjehl> I got a blank page after a transition once, but can't seem to reproduce
[14:28:08] <scottjehl> gseguin^
[14:28:10] <scottjehl> :)
[14:28:22] <scottjehl> in general though, this looks a lot better than the margins one
[14:59:30] <gseguin> scottjehl: sorry I was in a meeting
[14:59:53] <gseguin> the blank screen happens on the flip transition
[14:59:59] <gseguin> flip.reverse
[15:00:12] <scottjehl> hmm k
[15:00:16] <scottjehl> I got it on a slide
[15:00:20] <gseguin> hmm
[15:02:02] <gseguin> one thing that these do that we weren't doing
[15:02:13] <gseguin> is on the slideup, slidedown
[15:02:25] <gseguin> the original page moves away
[15:02:40] <gseguin> as opposed to being just covered by the page coming in
[15:05:56] <scottjehl> right right
[15:06:10] <scottjehl> I think we had a stay-still placeholder for timing
[15:06:11] <scottjehl> or something
[15:06:13] <scottjehl> but yeah
[15:06:20] <scottjehl> sorry but I have to head out
[15:06:26] <scottjehl> i'll be on later!
[16:17:05] <harvardjanitor7> hello!
[16:17:10] <harvardjanitor7> anyone here?
[16:19:02] <harvardjanitor7> suppp
[16:22:22] <harvardjanitor7> how do you declare a variable within the scope of one function, and then use it in another function?
