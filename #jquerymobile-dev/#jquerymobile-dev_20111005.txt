[09:53:34] <johnbender> and I'm back
[09:53:52] <johnbender> as though anyone noted my absence in the first place :D
[09:55:42] <kinblas> johnbender: I did. Glad you're back
[09:55:47] <kinblas> :-)
[10:19:07] <johnbender> kinblas: thanks man!
[10:19:12] * johnbender feels appreciated

[10:19:18] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2613 on jquery-mobile, reported by trevorjames (5h, 13m ago): Dialogs are not working with rc1 or b3
[10:19:28] <johnbender> I don't think footers are supposed to go in dialogs
[10:19:32] <johnbender> I'm tempted to close that one
[10:19:37] <johnbender> since that's the cause
[10:20:16] <johnbender> toddparker: scottjehl: kinblas: we've never intended for people use use footers in dialogs right?
[10:20:26] <johnbender> s/use use/to use/
[10:36:37] <toddparker> hey kinblas and johnbender
[10:36:54] <toddparker> don't think so johnbender
[10:37:04] <toddparker> any ideas on this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2605#issuecomment-2300705
[10:37:05] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2605 on jquery-mobile, reported by jterhune (22h, 35m ago): Unwanted automatic page change from link with data-ajax="false"
[10:37:08] <toddparker> seems mysterious
[10:37:51] <toddparker> johnbender: i don' think this should error out tho
[10:38:02] <toddparker> can we make dialogs not die if a footer is included?
[10:38:09] <toddparker> thought this was more style-oriented
[10:52:23] <johnbender> toddparker: I think it is style oriented
[10:52:40] <johnbender> toddparker: but a footer in a dialog seems odd to me
[10:52:56] <johnbender> although I'm terrible about making usability decisions
[10:53:11] <johnbender> toddparker: absolutely re-open if its something you feel should be supported
[11:19:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: toddparker: (whichever is the real you!) on the checked attribute, it appears as though the web inspector is just reporting the values incorrectly
[11:19:29] <johnbender> but I wanted to double check with you on that email
[11:43:33] <johnbender> ok crazypill averted
[11:43:51] <johnbender> it appears as though chrome's dev tools were reporting the checked attribute incorrecting in the console output
[14:56:58] <toddparker> kinblas: if you add a # to the number on the github issue track, it will link it
[14:57:21] <kinblas> toddparker: sigh .. ok I keep forgetting
[14:57:26] <kinblas> I'll edit those bugs
[14:58:52] <toddparker> np
[14:58:58] <toddparker> i linked and closed that dupe
[14:59:01] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2620
[14:59:01] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2620 on jquery-mobile, reported by frequent (1h, 17m ago): feature request: open dialog programmatically
[14:59:07] <toddparker> thoughts on that ^^
[14:59:09] <kinblas> toddparker: not sure what we're goig to do about those pushstate bugs though?
[14:59:19] <kinblas> they are bugs in Safari/Chrome
[14:59:19] <toddparker> shouldn't that work?
[14:59:31] * kinblas looks up 2620
[14:59:36] <toddparker> yeah, dunno
[14:59:47] <toddparker> thinkt eh best approaches probably to push on them to fix the bugs, right?
[14:59:49] <kinblas> yeah it should
[15:00:07] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, but that doesn't help users in the mean time
[15:00:21] <toddparker> no
[15:00:29] <toddparker> but isn't it sort of an edge case?
[15:00:38] <toddparker> what's the history sequence?
[15:00:56] <toddparker> dude, i'd love to get just 1 day of your time on fixed toolbars
[15:01:06] <toddparker> if i see one more issue like this...
[15:01:07] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2619
[15:01:08] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2619 on jquery-mobile, reported by prasannabhat (1h, 21m ago): fixed footer breaks after dynamic page changes
[15:01:14] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah I know
[15:01:20] <toddparker> does that need a refresh or re-position method or something?
[15:01:24] <kinblas> I've been spending the last couple of days chasing nav problems
[15:01:28] <toddparker> or we trigger this automatically
[15:01:29] <kinblas> some of which were user problems
[15:01:32] * kinblas sighs
[15:01:35] <toddparker> saw that
[15:01:45] <toddparker> appreciate you doingthat
[15:01:49] <kinblas> toddparker: and right now I'm trying to figure out why the nav test is failing
[15:02:07] <kinblas> but I can't reproduce it in a stand-alone real page
[15:02:23] <kinblas> was going to ping johnbender on that later when he's back from MAX
[15:02:41] <kinblas> toddparker: also lots of loose ends
[15:02:51] <kinblas> need folks who filed issues to get back to us
[15:02:59] <toddparker> yeah
[15:03:05] <toddparker> if it's been a while, close it
[15:03:08] <toddparker> 3 week
[15:03:10] <kinblas> I can't repro some of the things they are seeing *AND* inevitably it's due to some littel thing they are doing that they left out
[15:03:12] <kinblas> of the conversation
[15:03:17] <toddparker> yep
[15:03:49] <kinblas> toddparker: I haven't heard a thing from the rim folks regarding that conference
[15:03:54] <kinblas> I'll probably have to ping them
[15:04:10] <kinblas> can I steal your slides from jqcon ... as I did last year?
[15:04:11] <kinblas> :-D
[15:04:23] <kinblas> I need to brush up on what you guys were saying
[15:04:38] <kinblas> maybe add a little of the gotchas of mobile at the end
[15:04:56] <kinblas> since I can't talk about the other stuff as well as you guys
[15:05:19] <kinblas> toddparker: did they video you guys at jqcon?
[15:06:34] <toddparker> you sure can
[15:06:37] <toddparker> video, yes
[15:06:42] <toddparker> but not for a few weeks
[15:06:51] <toddparker> i'd love to see the TR from the keynote at max
[15:06:57] <toddparker> know where that is?
[15:07:18] <toddparker> when do you need the slides?
[15:07:26] <toddparker> where can i drop it? it's over 100mb
[15:07:30] <toddparker> embedded videos
[15:19:48] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #106: STILL FAILING in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/106/
[15:19:49] <jqm-jenkins-bot> mat: Fixes #2571, Fixes #2590, Fixes #2576 — All three issues were caused by improperly-scoped “position: relative;” on .ui-btn-text, within listviews.
[16:04:40] <johnbender> scottjehl: kinblas: gseguin: toddparker: aside from the budding server side community I get the impression that JQuery conf is sort of "browser js conf"
[16:05:09] <johnbender> although I acknowledge that there are other popular browser abstraction libraries (I think mootools is pretty cool)
[16:05:25] <johnbender> I mean more in terms of makeup/population size
[16:05:42] <johnbender> I guess I was just pondering the size and skillset spread of the people showing up to jqcon
[16:05:55] * johnbender should probably stop thinking out loud in IRC
[16:07:20] <kinblas> johnbender: the way I see it ... moo tools is more of a developers library .. or at least it started out that way
[16:07:28] <kinblas> with classes/objects etc
[16:07:42] <kinblas> jQuery was a bit more accessible to folks that didn't know how to code
[16:07:47] <eddiemonge> the speakers are diversified but the attendees are generally looking for jquery help. the other stuff is jsut a bonus
[16:08:22] <kinblas> johnbender: quick topic switch ... something is very wonky again with the unit tests
[16:08:31] <kinblas> things are failing like they used to ... randomlyy
[16:08:34] <kinblas> when running locally
[16:09:02] <kinblas> very frustrating ... I've been trying to see what the problem is with that one test that fails when pushstate is off ... but I can't repro it, even in a standalone real page
[16:09:26] <kinblas> and to top it off, running the tests locally gives me random failures
[16:09:39] <johnbender> kinblas: are you working on getting the that nav test to pass?
[16:09:45] <johnbender> s/the//
[16:09:47] <kinblas> did something change? Does that test-swarm thing add some element of async?
[16:09:52] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah
[16:10:01] <kinblas> that test that is being reported was a test I added last friday
[16:10:01] <johnbender> kinblas: it did update qunit but that shouldn't be an issue
[16:10:24] <kinblas> johnbender: i'm in sync with the HEAD in 2 different trees
[16:10:31] <johnbender> you can try reverting jzaefferer's commits and see if it fixes the issue but that would be really bad
[16:10:34] <kinblas> and running the tests in both produces different failures
[16:11:02] <johnbender> kinblas: HEAD pointing at the same commit in both trees?
[16:12:56] <johnbender> kinblas: also, I'm curious about this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2623
[16:12:57] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2623 on jquery-mobile, reported by gmachamer (2h, 12m ago): Problem with ajaxEnabled = false and the back button
[16:13:03] <johnbender> did you file a bug for it?
[16:13:36] <johnbender> or rather, is the spec clear on that behaviour? I'd have to go back and read it
[16:14:25] <kinblas> johnbender: the source in both trees are identical since I pulled at the same time.
[16:14:59] <kinblas> I was just trying to illustrate that the same source was producing different results/failures ... though I can get the same differeng results by re-running the tests for the same tree
[16:15:09] <kinblas> it's like we took a step backwards
[16:15:17] <kinblas> to the bad-ole days
[16:15:20] <kinblas> :-)
[16:15:49] <kinblas> johnbender: regarding 2623, I haven't filed anything yet. I wanted to stop this failure so we can stop getting emails
[16:15:58] <kinblas> .. and besides I introduced it :-
[16:16:00] <kinblas> :-)
[16:16:12] <kinblas> was planning on doing a minimal test case once i was done
[16:16:22] <kinblas> but if you want to do it ... fine by me :-)
[16:16:43] <kinblas> I'm a bit of a scatter brain today ... Indesign folks need my help on something
[16:17:15] <johnbender> kinblas: yes one thing I'm learning is that "The Kinblas" is well known within adobe
[16:17:40] <johnbender> many positive things were said about you over the course of my time at MAX
[16:17:43] <johnbender> anyhow!
[16:17:49] <johnbender> let me pull the latest and see what I get
[16:18:09] <johnbender> we do DEFINITELY have order sensitive tests because of the hash and page state
[16:18:20] * johnbender wants so badly to solve that problem in a generic fashion
[16:18:49] <kinblas> johnbender: heh I realized that when I started commenting out tests to see if something was causing my test to fail
[16:19:00] <kinblas> .. because it was passing when I isolated it
[16:20:24] <kinblas> johnbender: regarding the positive things .. thanks for letting me know :-)
[16:40:01] <johnbender> whoa
[16:40:10] <johnbender> apparently Steve Jobs has died ....
[16:40:48] <kinblas> what?
[16:41:12] <johnbender> yah
[16:41:23] <johnbender> Apparently he passed away today
[16:41:27] <johnbender> thats all I know
[16:42:11] <kinblas> johnbender: they're saying it was wrong
[16:42:15] <kinblas> and it took off on twitter
[16:42:49] <johnbender> johnbender: sigh
[16:42:53] <johnbender> I even checked around
[16:43:01] * johnbender is part of the problem
[16:43:07] <johnbender> I actually retweed jresig :(
[16:43:32] <kinblas> hmm I read an old source so apparently that happened recently
[16:44:02] <johnbender> kinblas: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/statement-by-apples-board-of-directors-2011-10-05
[16:44:43] <kinblas> ugh
