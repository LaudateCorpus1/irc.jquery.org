[06:36:53] <toddmparker> Morning all
[06:37:00] <bot-t> (14 hours 1 min ago) <gseguin> tell toddmparker: one thing that you can advertise about 1.3.1 is sourcemap
[06:38:44] <toddmparker> Sorry I dropped off yesterday
[06:38:57] <toddmparker> Sounds like we're ready to go?
[06:41:22] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker 
[06:41:44] <arschmitz> Morning all
[06:42:19] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[06:42:23] <arschmitz> back from NYC did i miss anything good lol?
[06:42:49] <uGoMobi> nah, nothing much
[06:42:55] <arschmitz> cool
[06:43:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you around?
[06:44:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we are almost ready to go... one file is missing on the CDN
[06:46:04] <gseguin> mornin'
[06:46:04] <bot-t> (6 hours 21 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell gseguin : the 1.3.1 theme CSS file is not on the CDN http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.1/jquery.mobile.theme-1.3.1.css (can't update the theme roller)
[06:46:22] <gseguin> oh gosh darn!
[06:46:29] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[06:46:32] <gseguin> do we even generate it
[06:48:14] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes we do
[06:48:25] <gseguin> ok so it's just that I forgot to copy it
[06:48:31] <gseguin> sorry :(
[06:48:43] <uGoMobi> I dunno
[06:59:48] <josejosif> hi all, from page1 i'm submitting a form via post to page2, when i hit refresh on page2, the post data is lost, im not getting the confirm form re-submit data. anyone had this problem?
[07:09:12] <toddmparker> Cool, so we're close then? I can get the web stuff ready to go 
[07:09:30] <toddmparker> Or is the one missing file going to take some time
[07:10:18] <gseguin> toddmparker: we're very close
[07:10:33] <gseguin> toddmparker: it's just the deploy that was a little messed up
[07:10:42] <toddmparker> Ok
[07:10:53] <gseguin> I upload the rest of the files manually and fix the Gruntfile so that doesn't happen again
[07:10:58] <RVPolonsky> Hi everybody
[07:14:09] <RVPolonsky> who knows, why there is no data-transition "slideleft" and "slideright"? Just "slide" which slides from the right to the left. But what if I need to slide my page from the left to the right?
[07:15:04] <gseguin> RVPolonsky: this is the developer channel, for support please use #jquery
[07:15:19] <gseguin> RVPolonsky: the default transition direction is left to right
[07:16:05] <RVPolonsky> oh sorry
[07:16:16] <gseguin> RVPolonsky: if you want to reverse it use the data-reverse=true (I think)
[07:16:32] <RVPolonsky> nice, thanks! i'll try it
[07:21:44] <gseguin> uGoMobi: we should be good now
[07:21:57] <gseguin> theme and structure are copied to the cdn
[07:25:04] <gseguin> toddmparker: ^
[07:25:16] <toddmparker> gseguin: what should i test to confirm? the zip?
[07:25:46] <gseguin> hmm darn the zip
[07:25:59] <gseguin> it could be missing these files as well
[07:26:02] <gseguin> lemme check
[07:26:43] <toddmparker> k
[07:26:48] <gseguin> toddmparker: the zip is good
[07:26:59] <gseguin> it's not missing structure and theme
[07:27:09] <toddmparker> cool
[07:27:16] <toddmparker> where is the sourcemap
[07:27:21] <toddmparker> i'll mention it
[07:27:43] <gseguin> it's jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.map
[07:28:20] <gseguin> basically if you use the CDN minified version and you put a breakpoint somewhere in the code
[07:28:46] <gseguin> when the debugger hit that breakpoints it uses the sourcemap to display the unminified code
[07:28:48] <toddmparker> what is the full url for the map?
[07:29:05] <gseguin> oh
[07:29:38] <toddmparker> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/
[07:29:43] <toddmparker> i'll link to this too
[07:30:01] <gseguin> yeah it's a good article
[07:30:07] <gseguin> the map is at http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.1/jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.map

[07:35:09] <toddmparker> thanks gseguin, just added that to the blog post
[07:35:30] <toddmparker> In this release, weâ€™ve also added support for sourcemaps in the library to make it possible to view the uncompressed code from the minified version. Sourcemap for jQuery Mobile 1.3.1.
[07:35:42] <toddmparker> ^ last bit is a link
[07:35:53] <gseguin> cool
[07:39:27] <toddmparker> gseguin, uGoMobi, arschmitz, johnbender, _|Nix|_ - I think I'm ready to announce 1.3.1
[07:41:43] <toddmparker> The search in the zip seems to 404 on every page
[07:42:17] <gseguin> hmm, uGoMobi ?
[07:42:21] <toddmparker> pooh, it 404's if you arrow down and hit Enter
[07:42:26] <toddmparker> works if you click
[07:42:59] <gseguin> hmm 1.3.2 immediatly following?
[07:46:21] <toddmparker> heh
[07:46:26] <toddmparker> it's just a docs zip issue
[07:46:39] <toddmparker> arrow keys work ok here - http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/examples/tables/reflow-refresh.html
[07:46:46] <toddmparker> hrm
[07:47:26] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: also broken - http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/examples/listviews/grid-listview-demo.html
[07:48:02] <toddmparker> gseguin: seems like all demos are broken inside /examples/
[07:48:03] <toddmparker> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/examples/listviews/autodividers-linkbar-demo.html
[07:48:51] <toddmparker> 404's, broken images/scripts
[07:48:52] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#278 (1.3-stable - a152a8f : Ghislain Seguin): The build is still failing.

[07:49:28] <toddmparker> not all, but many
[07:49:44] <toddmparker> same brokenness on view. and zip
[07:51:58] <uGoMobi> hmm
[07:52:05] <uGoMobi> wrong relative path
[07:52:31] <uGoMobi> gseguin: could this be because of this /dist/
[07:52:52] <gseguin> possibly
[07:54:02] <uGoMobi> gseguin: it is
[07:54:08] <uGoMobi> this works http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/demos/examples/listviews/grid-listview-demo.html
[07:55:10] <toddmparker> some work, some don't
[07:55:43] <uGoMobi> if you remove /dist/ from the url everything seems to be fine
[07:55:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I guess the ones that work are loaded via AJAX
[07:56:03] <toddmparker> ah
[07:56:18] <toddmparker> so do we need to add another hop ../
[07:58:24] <toddmparker> gseguin ^
[07:58:25] <uGoMobi> the reason we redirect to /dist/ is because otherwise you see version dev
[07:59:59] <toddmparker> so that is all for the version flag?
[08:01:07] <uGoMobi> I think we should just hardcode the version in next release
[08:01:19] <uGoMobi> easy enough to do find and replace
[08:02:24] <toddmparker> right
[08:02:43] <toddmparker> so we'll need to re-deploy anywayâ€¦better to just do that?
[08:02:51] <toddmparker> and skip /dist/ ?
[08:03:14] <toddmparker> sorry, i did miss some of this conversation so might be a silly q

[08:04:05] <gseguin> or just make view/1.3.1 be 1.3.1/dist
[08:04:34] <gseguin> gnarf how does view work?
[08:04:43] <gseguin> on semver tag what does it do?
[08:04:59] <gseguin> git checkout && grunt dist?
[08:05:15] <gnarf> grunt
[08:05:56] <gseguin> ok
[08:06:04] <gseguin> gnarf: is that configurable?
[08:07:44] <gnarf> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/services.pp#L72-L80
[08:07:45] <gnarf> yes
[08:07:49] <gnarf> you can change $buildscript
[08:07:53] <gnarf> but remember it runs for EVERY version
[08:08:07] <gnarf> also, might want to make $mobilebuildscript there instead
[08:08:31] <gseguin> gnarf: thanks, I'll look
[08:08:55] <gnarf> also, note that the buildscript outputs itself to build.out
[08:08:57] <gnarf> .txt
[08:08:58] <gnarf> etc
[08:09:12] <gnarf> perhaps submit that one as a pull so i can look over it once before we drop it in
[08:09:26] <gseguin> yup
[08:09:37] <gnarf> also, i think i fixed the bug where it was deleting the index page
[08:09:37] <gnarf> so yay
[08:09:39] <gnarf> :)
[08:10:22] <gseguin> gnarf: nice!
[08:11:01] <gseguin> I think that build script is fine
[08:11:39] <gseguin> gnarf: can we add a proxy rule to redirect semver/ to semver/dist ?
[08:11:54] <gnarf> i would really prefer not to
[08:12:10] <gnarf> dist/ won't be there on every build (or will it?)
[08:12:24] <gseguin> gnarf: it should be starting at 1.3.1
[08:12:28] <gnarf> also, since everything is all encapulsated there, it's kind of a pain to inject a rule for ONLY mobile on that
[08:12:41] <gseguin> gnarf: makes sense
[08:12:43] <gnarf> gseguin: well, that means every old semver would break if we did that
[08:13:02] <gseguin> gnarf: yeah true
[08:13:26] <gseguin> Ok I'll think of something else
[08:14:10] <gnarf> gseguin: index.html <script>location = 'dist/';</script> ?
[08:16:32] <gseguin> gnarf: yeah I put a meta refresh
[08:17:12] <gseguin> but for some reason, some pages don't like it
[08:17:20] <gseguin> I haven't looked in detail
[08:17:24] <gnarf> meta refresh?
[08:17:30] <gnarf> i haven't used that in like um
[08:17:32] <gnarf> 7 years?
[08:17:35] <gnarf> that shit still works? :)
[08:17:39] <gseguin> :D
[08:18:06] <gseguin> it does! even on browsers that don't support JS (do they really exist?)
[08:35:22] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I'll do some tests locally to see what's wrong
[08:35:38] <gseguin> I have to go get my knee checked out
[08:35:44] <gseguin> be back online in a bit
[09:15:47] <toddmparker> sounds like tomorrow for 1.3.1?
[09:25:21] <gseguin> toddmparker: so are these problems that you notice by unziping the zip file and opening it on your local webserver?
[09:34:47] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ^
[09:34:48] <uGoMobi> gseguin: hope your knee is ok
[09:35:01] <uGoMobi> gseguin: what's the link to the zip?
[09:35:17] <gseguin> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.1/jquery.mobile-1.3.1.zip
[09:35:21] <uGoMobi> thanks
[09:35:29] <gseguin> what's wrong with it?
[09:35:53] <gseguin> gotta run but I'll look at it as soon as I get back online
[09:36:19] <gseguin> uGoMobi: mention me or PM me with your findings
[09:36:48] <uGoMobi> will do
[09:42:28] <uGoMobi> gseguin|away: the problem is that we don't replace the links in the head anymore
[09:44:04] <uGoMobi> so we still have something like ../../js/ in the demos while there is no JS folder

[10:36:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i would hold off on any more switching to the option demultiplex we discussed a different way of doing this while you were out last week
[11:10:42] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I just see that I was wrong, we still have /js/ folder
[11:11:26] <uGoMobi> it's something with the path, lemme check again
[11:14:18] <uGoMobi> ok I get it... we do have the folder but we always have to point at the file and not just the map /js/
[11:14:47] <uGoMobi> (because we can't use index.php obviously)
[11:15:43] <uGoMobi> on the homepage the link to the JS is replaced correctly, but on many other pages it isn't

[11:33:41] <uGoMobi> tj_vantoll: thanks!
[11:35:10] <tj_vantoll> Awesome thank you.
[11:42:48] <uGoMobi> gseguin: johnbender : ping!
[11:47:31] <gseguin> uGoMobi: pong
[11:47:41] <gseguin> so you figured it out?
[11:47:47] <uGoMobi> gseguin: here is the big Q
[11:48:09] <uGoMobi> in the zip...
[11:48:19] <gseguin> the answer is 42
[11:48:28] <uGoMobi> jquery.mobile-1.3.1/demos/examples/listviews/grid-listview.html vs. jquery.mobile-1.3.1/demos/examples/listviews/grid-listview-demo.html
[11:48:37] <uGoMobi> lol... how did you know? :)
[11:49:33] <uGoMobi> in the first file links in the head are replace, e.g. <script src="../../_assets/js/index.js"></script>
[11:49:50] <uGoMobi> in the second file: <script src="../../_assets/js/"></script>
[11:50:41] <uGoMobi> that goes for both the link to assets/js/ as the link to jquery.mobile.js
[11:51:00] <gseguin> there are no diff between your 2 paths
[11:51:08] <uGoMobi> so this is a problem in the gruntfile
[11:51:29] <uGoMobi> nope, just two files in same folder
[11:51:55] <uGoMobi> same level
[11:52:05] <gseguin> oh -demo
[11:52:06] <gseguin> ok
[11:52:19] <gseguin> lemme look
[11:52:44] <uGoMobi> have been looking at demos.firstpass but can't figure it out
[11:56:11] <uGoMobi> gseguin: the issue with the images is probably the same as the favicon... JPG's are broken
[11:58:19] <gseguin> ok
[11:59:21] <gseguin> uGoMobi: that makes sense, I should use an including pattern rather than an excluding one
[12:23:29] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I'm going to push a change to the gruntfile on master
[12:23:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok
[12:23:51] <gseguin> can you check the resulting dist/demos for similar issues
[12:24:07] <gseguin> if that fixes it then we'll release 1.3.2 quickly
[12:25:10] <gseguin> oh wait there are php files in dist that's no good
[12:25:12] <uGoMobi> gseguin: sure
[12:29:57] <gseguin> johnbender: ping
[12:31:49] <johnbender> gseguin: pong
[12:32:08] <gseguin> johnbender: why do you copy the php files to dist?
[12:32:17] <johnbender> gseguin: which pass?
[12:32:35] <gseguin> demos.nested-includes
[12:33:15] <johnbender> gseguin: to minimize the change for the other passes that already existed
[12:33:35] <johnbender> gseguin: again pulling in the content for the includes is done with a php file extension
[12:33:44] <gseguin> do they need to be cleaned up afterward?
[12:33:49] <johnbender> gseguin: don't think so
[12:33:54] <johnbender> gseguin: they aren't reference anywhere
[12:33:55] <johnbender> I mean
[12:33:56] <johnbender> yes
[12:34:02] <johnbender> but no it's not going to affect anyone
[12:34:09] <johnbender> or at least it shouldn't
[12:34:20] <gseguin> we don't want them in the zip do we?
[12:34:27] <johnbender> no probably not
[12:34:35] <johnbender> short term hack is short term?
[12:34:44] <gseguin> heh :)
[12:34:55] <gseguin> I was just curious
[12:39:54] <gseguin> uGoMobi: why is demos/examples/redirect excluded?
[12:40:13] <uGoMobi> gseguin: because it's a php demo
[12:40:24] <gseguin> duh! that makes sense
[12:58:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Can you give me a skinny on the idea?
[13:00:38] <arschmitz> Hey _|Nix|_
[13:00:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[13:01:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lots of stuff happened last week - not least of which, "Blink" ...
[13:01:26] <arschmitz> we want to move all option and setup logic for widgets into refresh
[13:01:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You take one little vacation, and BAM!
[13:01:40] <arschmitz> then in _create you just call refresh
[13:01:52] <arschmitz> and in setOptions
[13:01:57] <arschmitz> you also just call refresh
[13:02:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not always.
[13:02:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For example, slider calls refresh when you change whether you want a highlight, but otherwise  it does not.
[13:03:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know this would not work right now
[13:03:27] <arschmitz> but we want to refactor so it will work this way
[13:03:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, how do you avoid executing unnecessary code while keeping the refresh method parameterless.
[13:03:35] <_|Nix|_> ?
[13:03:58] <_|Nix|_> I guess that's what setOptions is for, eh?
[13:04:09] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:04:20] <arschmitz> it will make keeping state much cleaner
[13:04:38] <arschmitz> and make refresh easy
[13:04:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Have you considered getting rid of any setup code in _create() and simple calling this._setOptions( this.options )?
[13:05:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, _create sets up the divs, does a $.extend, hooks up handlers, and calls this._setOptions( this.options ) ...
[13:05:40] <arschmitz> this is basicly the same idea
[13:05:50] <arschmitz> but instead of calling setOptions it calls refresh
[13:05:58] <arschmitz> and setOptions calls refresh
[13:06:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I see a problem there.
[13:06:19] <arschmitz> ?
[13:06:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: _setOptions gets a whole pile of options which are discarded by calling refresh.
[13:06:50] <arschmitz> how so?
[13:06:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If I only wanna set the theme, I don't want to also set the value, set the trackTheme, and whatnot.
[13:07:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because refresh is not refresh( options ), but refresh() ...
[13:07:23] <arschmitz> refresh is whatever you make it there is no built in refresh
[13:07:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... I know we have a pile of refresh methods that have params, but they shouldn't.
[13:07:57] <arschmitz> refresh is not a built in widget factory method
[13:08:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, but we're essentially adding it as a promise. We promise that all our widgets shall have a refresh method.
[13:09:34] <arschmitz> and if you only change theme track theme wont change because even if you rerun track theme setting the old and new values will be the same
[13:09:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So we should make sure that they all have the same signature and they all behave the same way.
[13:09:44] <arschmitz> yes we are basicly adding it as a promise
[13:10:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but setting a value that is already set is expensive.
[13:10:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: A total waste of CPU.
[13:10:34] <arschmitz> right you dont need to reset it only react to actual changes

[13:10:48] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14bbc1ed3 15Ghislain Seguin: Build: Fixed images by moving the copy of non-html, non-php to the unprocessed pass
[13:10:50] <gseguin> uGoMobi: can you try the new master and let me know?
[13:11:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, and the only place where you are made aware of actual changes is setOptions, not refresh.
[13:11:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok, will do that in a few minutes
[13:11:43] <arschmitz> right but we can pass options object to refresh and passing an argument is fine if we do it this way everywhere
[13:12:14] <arschmitz> we should make refresh consistant but we can make it able to take the object in all widgets and then that is consistant
[13:12:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's true. In that case, refresh basically becomes a public version of _setOptions ...
[13:13:21] <arschmitz> yes but we also dont need to advertise that
[13:13:29] <_|Nix|_> We might as well function blah() {} ... { refresh: blah, _setOptions: blah } ...
[13:13:31] <arschmitz> infact we could make _refresh which takes options
[13:13:42] <arschmitz> and refresh which does not
[13:13:52] <_|Nix|_> I already do that in places.
[13:14:45] <arschmitz> i have piles of widgets iv written on my own for ui and jqm and this is how i generally handle options
[13:14:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: proposed this as well
[13:15:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, we should have refresh() which calls _setOptions() ...
[13:15:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... not the other way around ...
[13:15:39] <arschmitz> yeah if we do a public and private method i think that makes sense
[13:15:49] <arschmitz> call setOptions in _Create
[13:15:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then, refresh() can figure out which options need to be set based on the DOM changes that have taken place to cause the widget to get out of sync.
[13:16:20] <arschmitz> refresh should be blind
[13:16:38] <arschmitz> it should just reinforce the setup with the current options
[13:17:14] <arschmitz> reinforce as in inforce once again not strengthen lol
[13:17:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono ... refresh is responsible for making sure the DOM for the original element is reflected in the actual widget.
[13:18:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, $( "#myCheckbox" ).prop( "checked", true ).checkboxradio( "refresh" );
[13:18:18] <arschmitz> right
[13:18:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In fact, in the above code no options have changed.
[13:18:27] <arschmitz> yes
[13:18:44] <arschmitz> what im saying is it should be blind in that it set EVERYTHING up again
[13:18:54] <arschmitz> it does not attempt to figure out what has changed 
[13:19:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's bad, because we end up overwriting a lot of values with themselves, and code like that may not always be equivalent to a NOOP.
[13:20:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking maybe for a scenario like that we can pass { checked: true } into _setOptions ... that's not an advertised option, but an internal one.
[13:20:43] <arschmitz> i think trying to prdeict what aspect the dev intended to refresh is bound to fail
[13:21:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We figure that out when we construct the widget. We need to figure it out again during refresh.
[13:22:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, if ( this.element.pro( "checked" ) ) { /* set the right icon, etc. */ }
[13:22:10] <arschmitz> refresh should be essentially the same as when the widget is created
[13:22:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We need to run code like that during refresh.
[13:22:29] <arschmitz> thats why we want to move the dom setup out of create and into refresh
[13:22:37] <arschmitz> exactly
[13:22:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think that will kill performance.
[13:23:35] <arschmitz> a dev should understand when they call refresh it is refereshing the dom
[13:23:51] <arschmitz> which will be essentially the same as setting it up
[13:23:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: this.slider.removeClass( "ui-btn-up-a" ).addClass( "ui-btn-up-a" ) if the theme has not changed? What's the point of that?
[13:24:28] <arschmitz> why would we do that durring setup?
[13:24:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We would do that during refresh, if refresh applies /all the options/ again.
[13:24:48] <arschmitz> and if we dont do it durring setup we should not do it durring refresh
[13:26:00] <arschmitz> refresh would just add the class not remove it if its allready there nothing happens if its missing its added
[13:26:12] <arschmitz> the same as if someone already added the class durring setup
[13:26:20] <arschmitz> or _create rather
[13:26:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's nog gonna work. What if I do change the theme?
[13:26:37] <uGoMobi> gseguin: still doesn't work
[13:26:43] <gseguin> shite!
[13:26:46] <arschmitz> then you should have done it through options
[13:26:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You're gonna end up with "ui-btn-up-a ui-btn-up-b"
[13:26:59] <gseguin> so what's not working?
[13:27:05] <gseguin> I don't get it uGoMobi 
[13:27:10] <gseguin> sorry for being thick
[13:27:21] <uGoMobi> gseguin: just do grunt dist on master
[13:27:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: people should not be manually applying theme classes
[13:27:47] <uGoMobi> gseguin: and open demos index.html
[13:27:49] <arschmitz> and if they are we should not support that
[13:28:22] <uGoMobi> gseguin: then demos showcase > grid listview > open demo
[13:28:23] <_|Nix|_> I never said that people would apply theme classes by hand.
[13:28:32] <arschmitz> you lost me then
[13:29:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If _setOptions does .removeClass().addClass(), it will work correctly when someone changes the theme via the API.
[13:29:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, it will do unnecessary work if refresh calls _setOptions.
[13:29:23] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#281 (master - bbc1ed3 : Ghislain Seguin): The build was fixed.
[13:29:23] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/b2b429b3968d...bbc1ed383766

[13:29:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : didn't follow your discussion but see this doc from tj_vantoll http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/65050459/Classes%20Option
[13:29:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, if _setOptions only does _addClass, it will work incorrectly when someone changes the theme via the API.
[13:30:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This is not necessarily about adding/removing classes.
[13:30:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's more general.
[13:30:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[13:30:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ ok i follow your scenerio now 
[13:31:20] <gseguin> uGoMobi: does that work in non built mode?
[13:31:27] <arschmitz> and i think that refresh being slightly slower should be ok refresh is not something that should be called in a loop
[13:31:28] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes
[13:32:21] <uGoMobi> gseguin: because then we have the php files in the js folders
[13:32:56] <gseguin> ha!
[13:33:04] <uGoMobi> gseguin: if you check the head you'll see that we still point to _assets/js/ and ../js/
[13:33:05] <gseguin> ok now I see what you mean
[13:33:36] <uGoMobi> gseguin: sorry if I wasn't clear before
[13:34:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ i dont have much time right now but i want to discuss this more tomorrow
[13:35:17] <arschmitz> if you have time if i get a chance tonight ill make a sample widget and put it in a gist or something so we can be clear on whats being proposed
[13:35:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: I'm confused about why moving our setup into refresh and making it idempotent would hurt performance?
[13:35:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[13:35:25] <johnbender> it is just that we have to check everything every time?
[13:35:41] <johnbender> instead of splitting the "one time" stuff into _create?
[13:35:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Because we want to minimize the code we run. Why set a value that is already set?
[13:36:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: what do you mean by "setting a value"
[13:36:08] <johnbender> manipulating the DOM?
[13:36:26] <arschmitz> johnbender: like setting a class
[13:36:33] <arschmitz> that is already set
[13:36:53] <johnbender> I thought the reason for moving this stuff into refresh was to ensure that it "did the right thing"
[13:37:27] <johnbender> so that refresh didn't be have so differently from instatiation
[13:37:52] <arschmitz> johnbender yes thats the idea exactly
[13:38:00] <arschmitz> thats what we talked about last week
[13:38:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah. Reflecting the meaning of a value in the DOM.
[13:38:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: do we have some alterantive route to achieve that same thing?
[13:39:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I would suggest that we apply all our options in _setOptions() and call _setOptions() from refresh after having figured out (just as we do during _create) what options need to be changed based on the state of the DOM.
[13:39:35] <johnbender> or are you making the case that we should just punt on that for now
[13:39:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nono. I want widgets to have a consistent internal structure.
[13:40:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: how is that different from checking the state of the dom in refresh?
[13:40:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im starting to think we are talking about the same thing
[13:40:26] <arschmitz> just describing it differently
[13:40:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We are. However, arschmitz was saying that we set /all/ the options during refresh, whether they've changed or not.
[13:41:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: as long as _setOptions doesn't change the dom when the option is set I'm fine with it
[13:41:31] <johnbender> it seems like the same thing just in different places
[13:41:43] <johnbender> either refreth or _setOptions
[13:42:07] <johnbender> are there things that would take place outside of setting options that would happen on a refresh?
[13:42:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There's another aspect. When setting options, _setOptions gets called and you know exactly what has changed.
[13:42:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, there's the interesting topic of the value.
[13:42:27] <gseguin> uGoMobi: so a quick fix
[13:42:39] <uGoMobi> gseguin: duct tape?
[13:42:41] <uGoMobi> :D
[13:42:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: A form widget's value is not an option, but a significant amount of calculation happens based on it.
[13:42:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and none of the options have changed.
[13:43:16] <johnbender> right
[13:43:25] <johnbender> hmm
[13:43:27] <arschmitz> a form widget should account for that in refresh before dealing with options
[13:43:30] <johnbender> maybe that's the logical division then
[13:43:38] <gseguin> uGoMobi: is to rename grid-listview-demo.html -> grid-listview-demo.php
[13:43:55] <gseguin> the issue is that it doesn't get processed by demos.secondpass
[13:44:01] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ahhh that's the cause
[13:44:01] <arschmitz> it would do the same durring initalization
[13:44:14] <uGoMobi> those files already have the html extension
[13:44:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then why would refresh ever end up setting all the options over again?
[13:44:59] <gseguin> so either we rename them to .php
[13:45:02] <johnbender> options based DOM manip in _setOptions and refresh takes care of "other" + _setOptions
[13:45:08] <johnbender> or juts "other"
[13:45:23] <gseguin> or I change the second pass to process some HTML files ( you tell me which ones) 
[13:45:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin: renaming them seems a better idea
[13:46:00] <uGoMobi> gseguin: let's just be consistent in file extensions
[13:46:40] <uGoMobi> I am sure we will forget to add to list of exceptions when we add another .html file in the future
[13:46:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If you call _setOptions from refresh, which options would you set?
[13:46:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, you figure out which have changed, right?
[13:47:17] <uGoMobi> gseguin: what is the plan, leave 1.3.1 zip broken?
[13:47:29] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I am asking because of the version
[13:47:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But there's an opportunity here: During _create() you can set up the widget to reflect the options by calling _setOptions() from create with /all/ the options, because, well, you haven't applied any of them yet.
[13:47:51] <uGoMobi> if we going to make changes and redeploy anyway I can hardcode the version
[13:48:27] <arschmitz> refresh would also call setoptions with all options because its suposed to deal with potential dom changes that could have wiped classes and such out
[13:49:09] <arschmitz> so its not that an option may have changed
[13:49:17] <arschmitz> its that it may need to be reapplied
[13:49:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nononono ... I think that asks too much. If someone messes with classes we've added to this.element, she's on her own.
[13:49:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: .... and if she modifies DOM we've generated, she's /definitely/ on her own.
[13:49:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no because what about like table where you could be adding or removing rows
[13:50:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's not this.element. That's the children of this.element.
[13:50:28] <arschmitz> right i wasent talking about this.element
[13:50:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then you don't need to set any of the options again.
[13:50:57] <arschmitz> setting an option can effect classes on more then just this.element
[13:51:22] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: I'm out for lunch I'll read back in a min
[13:51:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I see what you're saying.
[13:52:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This is for container widgets though, not all widgets.
[13:52:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because container widgets have options that refer to its children, not to the container itself.
[13:52:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Consider a popup. Why would that even have a refresh method at all?
[13:53:31] <arschmitz> with out looking since popup is created on the fly i cant see why we would
[13:53:58] <arschmitz> almost all out widgets have either child parent or sibling elements effected by its options though
[13:55:18] <gseguin> uGoMobi: yes I think we should leave it broken
[13:55:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, but elements we control (such as wrappers, slider tracks, slider buttons, etc.) need not have their options re-applied when the value changes.
[13:55:34] <gseguin> and release 1.3.2 immediatly after we fix that issue
[13:55:36] <uGoMobi> hmm
[13:55:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Only elements that the user can legitimately insert into our widget.
[13:56:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Think of the contents of a listview/controlgroup/collapsibleSet as its value.
[13:56:10] <gseguin> or skip 1.3.1
[13:56:23] <gseguin> and declare it DOA
[13:56:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then, when you add/remove items, its value has changed.
[13:56:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Enter refresh(), which is responsible for making sure the value is reflected in the widget.
[13:57:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so is what your saying not all widgets would neet to call set options in refresh only some?
[13:57:52] <gseguin> uGoMobi: meeting in 3 minutes
[13:57:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ideally, none.
[13:58:10] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok, let's discuss with toddmparker tomorrow
[13:58:11] <gseguin> you can start renaming then
[13:58:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, container widgets will have to consult those options which apply to the children in order to properly re-enhance their children.
[13:59:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i need to run
[13:59:26] <arschmitz> but we should take this back up tomorrow and iron out a plan we are all happy with on this before moving forward
[13:59:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Let's talk about this tomorrow some more. My daughter has a cold, so my presence will likely be ad-hoc.
[13:59:50] <arschmitz> also did you see the doc i made last week on widget standards and performance?
[14:00:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm pretty much down with the idea of moving all option setting into _setOptions.
[14:00:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes. Nice! Very detailed.
[14:00:40] <arschmitz> feel free to add or edit its global editable
[14:00:51] <arschmitz> just let me know if you do so i know 
[14:00:59] <arschmitz> that something has changed
[14:01:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: My vision is that _setOptions is a black magic method that's highly widget-specific and accomplishes all option-setting quickly and efficiently.
[14:02:00] <arschmitz> yeah we are pretty much on same page i think its just about the exact implementation
[14:02:23] <arschmitz> alk to you tomorrow though
[14:02:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think we should refactor one or two widgets just to try our hand at this.
[14:02:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: K L8R
[14:02:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ i agree
[14:02:53] <arschmitz> l8r
