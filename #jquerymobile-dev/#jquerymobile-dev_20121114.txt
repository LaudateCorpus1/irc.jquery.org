[05:45:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: @VERSION at the top of jquery.ui.widget.js needs to be replaced by the actual version... is this 1.9.2 pre (11/13/2012) ?
[06:04:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, sorry!
[06:04:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's from master.
[06:04:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll build it in jquery-ui and copy the version string over.
[06:04:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The commitid is in the commit message.
[06:05:05] <_|Nix|_> I mean the jQuery UI commitid from which I grabbed the file is in the jQM commit message for the commit that replaces the old widget factory.

[06:14:14] <_|Nix|_> OK. I pasted in the version and commitid.
[06:48:47] <toddmparker> hi all
[06:48:50] <uGoMobi_> _|Nix|_: Thanks!
[06:49:01] <toddmparker> just catching upâ€¦lots of chatter
[06:49:16] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: thanks for updating the widget factory
[06:49:35] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: morning
[06:49:39] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: did you make a branch for that input clear button stuff? you test page is awesome btw
[06:50:04] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: yes, I pulled his commits in a branch
[06:50:16] <uGoMobi_> so I could test it
[06:52:10] <toddmparker> cool
[06:52:27] <toddmparker> excellent feedback, sounds like he is going to address your input
[06:53:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: His input on the input clear feature for text input?
[06:53:51] <toddmparker> mat just got here
[06:53:58] <toddmparker> Wilto rather
[06:54:09] <_|Nix|_> :)
[06:55:15] <uGoMobi_> Thanks
[06:57:11] <uGoMobi_>  I was in doubt if I should just say thanks for the PR but closing because it doesn't work properly
[06:57:21] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yes, it was very clear and the guy seemed happy to fix things. Being nice can save us a lot of work.
[06:57:37] <uGoMobi_> but then I thought it is better to encourage people to contribute
[06:57:50] <uGoMobi_> exactly
[06:58:07] <toddmparker> +1000
[06:58:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I know, and +1, it just sounds funny :)
[06:59:55] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1834#issuecomment-10368386
[07:01:02] <uGoMobi_> maybe we need to disable the clear button feature for some input types
[07:06:49] <uGoMobi> ah, IRCCloud alpha server is back online
[07:08:22] <uGoMobi> downtime === uptime :(
[07:09:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4746 ?
[07:15:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: To check whether a certain type of widget has already been created based on a given element e, you need to do $( e ).data( "ns-widgetname" ) !== undefined ...
[07:16:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah of cource!
[07:16:58] <_|Nix|_> So, if ( $( e ).data( "mobile-listview" ) === undefined ) { $( e ).listview(); }
[07:17:30] <uGoMobi> yeah, why didn't I think of that :(
[07:17:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think this bug qualifies as developer education.
[07:18:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I had this knowledge cached, because I updated the widget factory just yesterday, and the new widget factory stores the widget definition at .data( "ns-widgetname" ) instead of the old .data( "widgetname" ) ...
[07:19:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can comment on the bug and close it, if you'd like.
[07:20:23] <uGoMobi> I think I cleared my brain last night because I was looking at something yesterday where I used data() too
[07:20:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, please do :)
[07:21:37] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[07:22:47] <uGoMobi> we should add some info about this to the docs too... I'll make a note
[07:25:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: BTW - the issue I was looking at yesterday was https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3880#issuecomment-4719668
[07:25:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Perhaps a link to the jQuery UI widget factory documentation would be better.
[07:25:57] <uGoMobi> have to test that with current version of the widget factory
[07:26:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good idea
[07:34:49] <uGoMobi> Wilto: any luck with transform3dTest() and validStyle() ?
[08:34:43] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1834#issuecomment-10368386
[09:05:53] <ryanneufeld> ping toddmparker
[09:10:18] <ryanneufeld> ?tell toddmparker Last week you had said you'd look for some code to stuff adds in iframes. I was wondering if you'd had the chance?
[09:10:18] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Okay.
[09:42:05] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you here?

[09:58:36] <johnbend1r> gseguin: yo
[09:58:41] <johnbend1r> let me check what time my meeting is
[09:58:56] <gseguin> 'sup johnbend1r?
[09:59:15] <johnbend1r> the adobe firewall is making it difficult to contact my irc proxy
[09:59:26] <johnbend1r> gseguin: agh, the meeting is supposed to be really really long
[09:59:27] <toddmparker> so enterprise
[09:59:33] <johnbend1r> lol
[09:59:34] <toddmparker> what meeting?
[09:59:35] <johnbend1r> seriously
[09:59:46] <johnbend1r> toddmparker: I'm meeting a professor in Palo Alto
[10:00:19] <toddmparker> ah
[10:00:28] <gseguin> and I'm in Palo Alto!
[10:00:48] <toddmparker> you guys getting together?
[10:00:54] <gseguin> or at least my body is there

[10:01:10] <johnbend1r> nice
[10:01:58] <gseguin> johnbend1r: let me know if you want to grab lunch
[10:08:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Re: border color fallback... yes, that should work
[10:09:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: did you see my JS Bin yesterday about using ui-br class for tables?
[10:09:32] <johnbend1r> gseguin: I will
[10:11:23] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: no, can you re-send?
[10:11:50] <toddmparker> we need to drop in 1.8.3 in docs
[10:12:33] <uGoMobi> 17:18 <uGoMobi> toddmparker: tables border color http://jsbin.com/omegup/2/edit
[10:12:33] <uGoMobi> 17:19 <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we can change .ui-br {} into .ui-br, .ui-br td {} in the theme css
[10:13:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: on Chrome border-inherit works on tables, but FF it doesn't (font color will be used). so we would have to add "td" in the theme CSS
[10:15:31] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: hmm... I just see that with border collapse you will get two borders on top of eachother
[10:15:45] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: so is inherit to allow the theme styles to flow through
[10:18:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: you want to apply border color of ui-body or use a different style like ui-br?
[10:18:30] <toddmparker> right now, I note that these classes don't play with theming
[10:18:31] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/tables/docs/tables/index.html
[10:19:29] <toddmparker> I sort of think that the styles you need for a row stripe or border are different than the theme
[10:19:49] <toddmparker> usually the theme stuff will be too strong visually or at least unpredictable
[10:19:49] <johnbend1r> toddmparker: working on some internal stuff for the next few days
[10:19:55] <johnbend1r> still closing in on the finish line
[10:19:59] <johnbend1r> (popups right now)
[10:20:00] <toddmparker> johnbender: ok
[10:20:04] <toddmparker> cool
[10:20:49] <toddmparker> i could move these classes into the docs css
[10:21:07] <toddmparker> i just don't want to have to apply a style block just to add the strokes on each demo
[10:21:27] <toddmparker> but i agree that having the stroke hard coded int eh open table styles was bad. so i at least moved these into a class
[10:21:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: http://jsbin.com/omegup/7/edit
[10:22:36] <uGoMobi> you have to set border-style to make border styling to flow through
[10:22:46] <toddmparker> i see
[10:23:32] <toddmparker> i can see the border being too punchy
[10:23:36] <toddmparker> with themes
[10:23:50] <toddmparker> so how to negate the left/right borders
[10:23:55] <uGoMobi> yeah, I agree
[10:25:22] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/omegup/8/edit
[10:26:20] <toddmparker> i see what you did. so if i take off the theme class, it still get the minimal strokes
[10:26:21] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/omegup/9/edit
[10:26:23] <toddmparker> neat
[10:26:48] <toddmparker> where does the color come from when there is no theme class
[10:26:55] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/omegup/10/edit
[10:28:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I used !important to negate left/right border but could be done with higher specificity
[10:28:34] <uGoMobi> it depends... Chrome has default color gray for table borders
[10:28:49] <toddmparker> i see
[10:28:51] <uGoMobi> other browsers might use the font color
[10:28:59] <toddmparker> and if we set them, then we kill theming
[10:29:01] <toddmparker> right?
[10:32:21] <toddmparker> i do like this idea. add theming support pretty easily
[10:32:41] <uGoMobi> looks like setting class ui-body-* on the table overrides what you set by default
[10:33:09] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/omegup/11/edit
[10:33:18] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/omegup/12/edit
[10:33:53] <toddmparker> yeah, that works
[10:33:59] <toddmparker> but you can't set a color
[10:34:00] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/omegup/11/edit
[10:34:25] <uGoMobi> ah I see
[10:34:30] <toddmparker> that kills the theme
[10:34:44] <toddmparker> but as a bare bones set of rules, i like this
[10:36:24] <uGoMobi> the problem is that structure CSS comes after theme CSS
[10:36:35] <uGoMobi> that's why the color is overridden
[10:37:02] <toddmparker> right, and it needs to be in that order
[10:37:04] <toddmparker> but yeah
[10:37:25] <toddmparker> but we could tell people they can add theme
[10:37:28] <toddmparker> or a style
[10:39:51] <uGoMobi> this works http://jsbin.com/omegup/16/edit
[10:40:58] <uGoMobi> but none of this works on FF :(
[10:42:02] <uGoMobi> table styling can be a pain
[10:48:14] <toddmparker> bummer
[10:48:56] <toddmparker> oh, I see. In FF, you don't get the theme inheritance
[10:49:03] <toddmparker> you just see the basic styles
[10:49:35] <uGoMobi> yeah :(
[10:49:50] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you said we  fox make it work in ff by adding selectors?
[10:50:08] <toddmparker> think we're going to have to do that as we move towards using more css
[10:50:39] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes, .ui-br td { border-color: # } worked
[10:51:04] <uGoMobi> had to set it for the td element explicitly
[10:51:05] <toddmparker> gotcha
[10:51:30] <toddmparker> similar to how i suggested we do that for buttons/lists
[10:51:30] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/ejejak/19
[10:51:57] <toddmparker> we'd need to add
[10:51:58] <toddmparker> .ui-listview li a
[10:52:15] <toddmparker> a.btn-a:link
[10:52:32] <toddmparker> etc. to have the theme button styles flow onto the right elements
[10:52:46] <toddmparker> think this is just part of the new thinking
[10:53:14] <toddmparker> theme used to be dumb: a class applied to anything
[10:53:41] <toddmparker> now theme styles need to be directed at elements
[10:53:51] <toddmparker> but this avoids needing to tack a billion classes on things
[10:53:54] <uGoMobi> we could probably do with a lot less JS addClass()
[10:54:01] <toddmparker> right
[10:54:41] <uGoMobi> now we landed css-corner-styling we could even drop options shadow and corners in JS
[10:55:43] <uGoMobi> if you add a class of .ui-style to containers like: <ul class="ui-listview ui-style">
[10:55:54] <uGoMobi> all you need in the theme CSS:
[10:56:23] <uGoMobi> .ui-style { border-radius: .6em; box-shadow: ...; }
[10:56:30] <toddmparker> right
[10:56:41] <toddmparker> i'm all for making these kind of changes
[10:56:58] <toddmparker> i'm using a lot of classes in the tables, very few data-attrs
[10:57:02] <toddmparker> brb
[10:57:02] <uGoMobi> simple to negate for a specific widget
[10:57:09] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:56:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: almost got table styling working on all browsers (only a problem with IE9): http://jsbin.com/omegup/18/edit
[11:57:56] <toddmparker> oh nice!
[12:14:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 2 new commits to tables: http://git.io/MpebFA
[12:14:48] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/tables b530943 Todd Parker: Swapped from row stripe to stroke
[12:14:48] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/tables 1f8da68 Todd Parker: Updated movie toggle customized demo to add theme classes
[12:15:07] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: it would be good if you could work your css magic to let the rounded corners inherit the first and last rows of a table
[12:15:38] <toddmparker> if you add hi-corner-all to the table here, the TH need rounding - tables/movie-list-toggle-options.html
[12:15:59] <toddmparker> that example has a theme class on the TH and the table
[12:16:05] <toddmparker> looks ok
[12:24:48] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: sure, I'll look into it
[12:27:14] <toddmparker> feel free to just edit all the table styles in that branch, go to town and help me clean this up
[13:40:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker, uGoMobi: If tables will have rounded corners, will they also run into the problem of first/last n hidden children?
[13:40:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker, uGoMobi: ... requiring the use of a .refresh() method and the addFirstLastChild extension?
[13:40:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think so
[13:41:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/9E5USA
[13:41:18] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/master c39e8fa Gabriel Schulhof: [select unit tests] Add tests to make sure select menus and custom select menus clean up after themeselves
[13:41:19] <uGoMobi> we can set the corners on the outer (table) element
[13:41:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I ask because of what toddmparker said: "if you add hi-corner-all to the table here, the TH need rounding - tables/movie-list-toggle-options.html"
[13:42:21] <uGoMobi> looks like I only have to do something about the header row
[13:43:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so the last row won't have rounded corners, and neither will the first row if it's not a TH, right?
[13:43:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no
[13:44:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the table will get rounded corners but it looks like we don't have to set specific rules for last row
[13:44:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can still think of a problem: If you style the TH element, the first n columns may be hidden, so who gets the rounded top left corner?
[13:44:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Same question about the top right corner.
[13:45:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah, that's right
[13:45:44] <uGoMobi> that might be a problem
[13:45:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Your only choice is to style the first row.
[13:46:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But if there are not TH elements, then the first row of data will get rounded corners.
[13:46:33] <uGoMobi> was thinking vertical, but with the table widget we could run into a horizontal problem because of the hide column feature
[13:46:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[13:46:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's like a horizontal controlgroup.
[13:47:28] <uGoMobi> I think for the table widget you always should have a thead with th elements
[13:47:53] <uGoMobi> but the first or last th could be hidden like you said
[13:48:05] <uGoMobi> going to look into this tomorrow
[13:48:06] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[13:48:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does the table widget already have a refresh() method?
[13:49:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, I don't think so... I think toddmparker asked Scott to add that
[13:50:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, if Scott adds it, we'll be set, because we can just pass the children of the first row to _addFirstLastClasses ...
[13:51:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[13:51:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, and we can even check if they're THs first, and not call _addFirstLastClasses if they're TDs.
[13:51:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if the table has no THs we don't add corners.
[13:52:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's cool that we have this generic mechanism for doing rounded corners.
[13:52:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why not?
[13:53:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, I like centralizing stuff
[13:53:45] <uGoMobi> the "why not?" is about not adding corners if no TH
[13:54:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Because I thought only THs were supposed to have rounded corners.
[13:54:40] <uGoMobi> nono
[13:55:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, so the first row gets rounded corners no matter what?
[13:56:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/omegup/20/edit
[13:56:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wow! Totally like all the other rounded corner things.
[13:57:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we're gonna have two levels of first/last children: one for the rows and one for the columns.
[13:58:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: here I don't need to know what is the first child or last child
[13:58:31] <uGoMobi> just add ui-corner-all to the table and done
[13:59:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but toddmparker said you need the THs to inherit the corners.
[13:59:14] <uGoMobi> but toddmparker mentioned that there was a problem if you used a class to style the first header row (thead) differently
[13:59:20] <uGoMobi> yup
[13:59:25] <_|Nix|_> Aha, OK.
[13:59:31] <uGoMobi> so that's what I have to look into
[13:59:32] <_|Nix|_> OK, I get it.
[13:59:56] <uGoMobi> and maybe we do need to know the first and last TH in THEAD to solve that
[14:00:16] <uGoMobi> because the hide columns feature
[14:00:24] <_|Nix|_> Yep ...
[14:00:25] <uGoMobi> but don't know yet for sure
[14:00:49] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[14:00:50] <uGoMobi> table styling with CSS is a bit of a struggle
[14:01:30] <uGoMobi> also because there are differences between browsers
[14:02:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: here you see the problem: http://jsbin.com/omegup/21/edit
[14:04:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I already saw that with omegup/20 :) ... but when I started looking at the code, it bumped you up to 21 :)
[14:04:42] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I get the problem.
[14:04:50] <uGoMobi> haha.... I always forget the new milestone
[14:04:59] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[14:05:20] <_|Nix|_> It's actually cool ... while I was looking at 20, it auto-updated to show your changes.
[14:06:04] <_|Nix|_> So, as long as I'm not looking at the code, I will see what changes you make.
[14:07:15] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:08:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the problem is even worse... check this on Chrome and FF http://jsbin.com/omegup/22/edit
[14:09:11] <uGoMobi> FF no corners (border-radius inherit seems not to work on tables)
[14:09:54] <uGoMobi> on Chrome the border itself is not rounded but the background of the THEAD does :/
[14:10:33] <uGoMobi> s/does/is/
[14:11:54] <_|Nix|_> Yep. Inconsistent :(
[14:23:10] <_|Nix|_> Man, this is insane! I add a single console.log and the unit test timeout doesn't seem to be happening anymore ...
[14:27:33] <agcolom> Hi all, On this page: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/slider/events.html it looks like the events should actually be start and stop instead of slidestart and slidetop... So I'll change that and the code example to be consistent with the other widgets... will do that tomorrow unless someone objects... Please let me know...
[14:48:24] <toddmparker> i'm heading home, goodnight all
