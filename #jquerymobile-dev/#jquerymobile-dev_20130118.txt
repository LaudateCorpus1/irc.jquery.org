[03:49:06] <uGoMobi> FYI - I renamed the "Ajax nav" label in the issue tracker to "Navigation"
[04:22:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[04:51:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: morning
[04:54:55] <arschmitz> cwdoh: ha ha no problem hope all is well! should catch up soon.
[04:55:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: morning
[05:01:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! What do you think about Changsuk's comments?
[05:02:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: even if they tested im really hesitant to make that change
[05:02:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We have to check in the body of our code whether we ever retrieve those values using .jqmData().
[05:03:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If we don't, we're really better off with .attr() ( if we don't trust .getAttribute() )
[05:03:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: id be ok with attr()
[05:04:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: .... alright ... lesse the perf impact ...
[05:04:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll push the fix for the multipage nav issue and then I'll descend onto this problem.
[05:04:55] * _|Nix|_ is running the unit tests for the multipage nav issue now.
[05:05:14] <arschmitz> while native methods can be good and faster in some cases we need to remember the main purpose of jquery and its methods is not to make it easy it to solve cross browser issues
[05:06:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and while this might work for this specific case with default values and namesapce we dont know what kind of crazieness people could do with namespace for attributes
[05:06:39] <arschmitz> and blow things up
[05:06:51] <arschmitz> and we know that getAttribute is not 100% safe
[05:08:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: one thing we want to remember when it comes to $.data() i found out yesterday is it wont retrive element attributes like data-theme="" unless they have already been read with $().data()
[05:10:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know. And that's a good point, actually ... using .attr() might result in a lot more reflows ...
[05:10:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: AFAIK, even reading DOM attributes causes reflows ...
[05:11:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Let's run this by jsperf ... 
[05:14:08] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz and _|Nix|_ 
[05:15:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually .attr() might be good, because we setAttribute() for all options passed to buttonMarkup, and I had to add a set via .jqmData() to that so that it can later be retrieved via .jqmData() if the button is re-styled.
[05:16:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, if we get rid of .jqmData() getter in buttonMarkup, we can get rid of .jqmData() setter in buttonMarkup's mapToDataAttr ...

[05:17:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah there im sure are better ways to do this espically for something like button markup
[05:17:50] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I pushed that ... I'll set up a jsperf for buttonMarkup ...
[05:33:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Uh-oh ... .attr() does not convert "true" to true ...
[05:34:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It returns "true" instead of true ...
[05:34:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok well i guess thats probably not best option then
[05:34:25] <arschmitz> maybe we use jqmdata for a reason lol
[05:34:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looks like ...
[05:34:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and getAttribute probably does the same ...
[05:35:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i would assume
[05:35:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... maybe the convert-to-boolean stuff is factored out into a function somewhere - if so, we can use it.
[05:35:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Otherwise, we need that first ...
[05:37:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[05:38:43] <arschmitz> oh _|Nix|_: something from the meeting yesterday is that toddmparker: wants you and i to start really diving into 1.4 and sketching out our plans here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-planning
[06:02:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Then we should migrate the widget review page there.
[06:02:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah list all the tickets we have tagged for it
[06:03:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: One thing we should decide is whether we want to keep data-* attributes in sync with this.options.* ...
[06:03:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm starting to think it might not be worth it.
[06:03:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: personally i dont think so
[06:03:44] <arschmitz> those should be inital config and thats it
[06:03:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... 
[06:04:29] <arschmitz> if they want to change or check an option they should be checking it on the widget not the element attributes
[06:04:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[06:05:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, for form widgets it's more complicated than that ...
[06:05:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because there's always a DOM attribute that needs to be changed.
[06:05:37] <arschmitz> do you mean because disabled?
[06:05:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right, that too.
[06:05:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking about value.
[06:06:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, disabled and value need to be kept in sync.
[06:06:22] <arschmitz> yeah i see those as special cases and they are not data-value or data-disabled they are just value and disabled
[06:06:45] <arschmitz> val is a very special case and isnt a an option
[06:07:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But here it gets even more complicated: If we want to be able to create a given widget based both on an input and a div, then we need to have a data-value ...
[06:07:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: very true
[06:07:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... well, I guess we don't but then we'll always have a special case to check.
[06:08:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I guess we do need it, because how do you read the value off a div-based slider?
[06:08:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think it would be a method 
[06:08:55] <arschmitz> i think we should add a value method in that case
[06:09:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't get it. jQuery has $.fn.val(), but that doesn't seem to work.
[06:09:35] <arschmitz> val is specificly for form elements
[06:09:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think once 1.3.0 is out the door, we should start a branch where we tackle things one widget at-a-time ...
[06:10:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i agree
[06:10:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ really need to put thought into how we are going to handle widgets outside pages and enhancing them and stuff too
[06:10:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Start with, like, I dunno, slider or something and make it work exactly as we intend and then move on to another widget with slider as the template.
[06:10:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i think thats a good approach
[06:10:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's a slightly different problem though.
[06:11:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's more of a startup problem.
[06:11:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you hook into pagecreate when there's no page?
[06:11:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes but we will want to build the widgets to handle it properly when we are refactoring
[06:11:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Definitely.
[06:11:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have a branch local where i made it work for toolbars navbars and buttons
[06:12:08] <arschmitz> i did it by using document ready for anything not in a page container
[06:12:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think the most basic step would be for widget constructors to work on elements that are outside pages.
[06:12:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and at that point we run into theme inheritance issues.
[06:13:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: anything not in a page if it does not have its own theme specified it gets a default theme
[06:13:23] <arschmitz> just like a page does now
[06:13:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess, and with on-the-fly options, we can always just .<widgetname>( "option", "theme", "x" ) later on.
[06:14:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[06:15:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: here is a rough one when removing from pages
[06:15:33] <arschmitz> i have seen a lot of request for popup outside a page
[06:15:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: jQuery has a locally scoped function for turning "true" into true ... so, it's not exposed :( ... it's pretty simple, but we shouldn't replicate the code.
[06:15:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, AFAIK that's not a big problem, unless the popup contains a listview.
[06:16:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You just have to instantiate it.
[06:16:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ah ok i was thinking history would be an issue but not really when i think about it 
[06:16:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess the automatic link binding doesn't work either.
[06:16:28] <arschmitz> since it doesnt change the page
[06:16:34] <_|Nix|_> That's right.
[06:16:50] <_|Nix|_> It's more about convenience - auto link binding and auto-enhance.
[06:17:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh something else that came up yesterday is maybe getting rid of nested listviews
[06:17:16] <_|Nix|_> Those are out, because the auto-link binding is scoped to the current page.
[06:17:22] <arschmitz> since they are horrible lol
[06:17:28] <_|Nix|_> Absolutely.
[06:17:38] <_|Nix|_> I Approve™
[06:17:48] <arschmitz> yeah im all on board for it too
[06:18:13] <arschmitz> a lot of headach for no real good 
[06:19:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... I'd still love to get rid of .jqmData() from buttonMarkup() but it doesn't look like it'll work.
[06:19:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: button markup is rough
[06:20:11] <arschmitz> id love to come up with a better way to do it lol
[06:20:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, it can be done, but not without replicating the dataAttr function from jQuery.
[06:20:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right which i dont think is a great idea
[06:22:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll comment to that effect ...
[06:22:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wonder if getAttribute() performs the "true" -> true modification ...
[06:23:01] <arschmitz> sounds good. Maybe add something to the effect of that yes while it is jquery mobile we support all platforms and browsers 
[06:23:05] <_|Nix|_> Of course not.
[06:23:25] <arschmitz> because he makes the mobile first argument for performance
[06:23:53] <_|Nix|_> Maybe we can shim $.fn.jqmData() in web-ui-fw ...
[06:24:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: since they are working on tizen they dont care about other stuff but sadly we do lol
[06:24:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats a good idea
[06:24:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but what they don't realize is a lot of devs will want to use upstream jQM along with web-ui-fw.
[06:24:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't think forking jQM is an option for Tizen ...
[06:25:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i wasent suggesting forking
[06:28:06] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jhogervorst opened issue #5484: Icon-only button becomes too high in non-mini controlgroup  02http://git.io/5sD-Kw
[06:28:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, but they might be thinking it. After all,  web-ui-fw does contain a copy of jQM ... I've currently made that a submodule rather than an include, but the original repo had a copy + some patches against it = a fork.
[06:28:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ahh i see
[06:28:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Those patches are not arriving in the form of PRs.
[06:28:48] <_|Nix|_> s/not/now/
[06:29:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah a shim could be a good idea for somethings but a fork means you dont get latest jqm upstream so yeah i agree not a great idea 
[06:30:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we could easily expose some things that are not currently for them to overwrite or shim too if it helped
[06:30:48] <arschmitz> that way the could make changes we are not willing to with out forking
[06:46:12] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[06:46:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've had an idea that might also improve performance. Instead of setting every option with .jqmData( key, value ), we use setAttribute and $.removeData( e, key )
[06:47:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That way, when you re-enhance the button, you end up calling jqmData again to get the existing value, and since the cache has been destroyed by .removeData(), it'll go back to checking the DOM.
[06:47:56] <_|Nix|_> So, basically, I've replaced .jqmData( key, value ) with $.removeData( e, key );
[06:48:02] <_|Nix|_> Lessee which one's faster.
[06:48:13] <_|Nix|_> This might slow down re-styling, but I don't think we re-style a lot.
[06:48:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ cool
[06:57:01] <gseguin> good morning

[07:00:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://jsperf.com/jqmdatavsremovedata/2
[07:00:41] <_|Nix|_> That's a good one (that issue) :)
[07:03:29] <arschmitz> and its chrome 25 for the win! lol
[07:04:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ they changed the look of the inspector a lot in 25
[07:11:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You mean $.removeData() wins in Chrome 25 as well?
[07:11:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just wish they got the breakpoints to stop jumping around ...
[07:11:39] <arschmitz> it does but no i was just meaning it smoked firefox 18 lol
[07:12:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aaaah ...
[07:13:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I do wonder how they establish these ops/s ... how is it processor-independent?
[07:13:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm thinking maybe they use real time ...
[07:13:37] <arschmitz> do they claim that it is processor independant
[07:13:38] <arschmitz> ?
[07:14:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I'm sure your copy of Chrome 25 runs on a different processor than my copy of FF18 ...
[07:14:20] <arschmitz> im sure
[07:14:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, that's what I mean. You'd have to run both on the same proc.
[07:14:39] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:14:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Come to think of it, even real time would be no indication.
[07:15:10] <arschmitz> no there is no real way to test performance across multiple systems and compare by anything other then percentages
[07:15:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: $.removeData looks to be faster than jqmData() in set mode.
[07:15:45] <arschmitz> yes
[07:18:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... could use a per-sample setup and teardown ...
[07:18:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah firefox test much faster on my pc then yours
[07:19:32] <arschmitz> im at like 2,800 ops/sec 
[07:20:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I still don't get why they cut things off at 11 runs ...
[07:21:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it dosent
[07:22:00] <arschmitz> its 11 per computer
[07:22:09] <arschmitz> after 11 any more become statisticly insignificant
[07:22:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see ...
[07:23:14] <arschmitz> right now on your last test firefox has 13 because i ran some
[07:23:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, cool!
[07:23:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I figured it was something like that ...
[07:24:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i dont know this for sure but im assuming its just a matter of statisitcal signifigance on multiple runs from same computer
[07:24:21] <toddmparker___> happy friday

[07:25:28] <toddmparker___> you bet
[07:25:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: out of curiosity what are you running for a pc 
[07:25:59] <toddmparker___> don't seem to have any history here in irccloud
[07:26:03] <toddmparker___> i miss anything
[07:26:24] <arschmitz> mostly just _|Nix|_: and i discussing performance 
[07:26:33] <arschmitz> in buttonmarkup 
[07:26:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2620M CPU @ 2.70GHz
[07:26:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: 4 cores.
[07:27:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: weird your slower then me then im on a dual core i5
[07:27:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe because I'm running BOINC on all cores ... it shouldn't technically matter, because they're prioritized really low ...
[07:28:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but maybe the memory usage ... I dunno ...
[07:28:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe who knows
[07:28:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... maybe the fact that FF has, like, 30 tabs open ...
[07:28:18] <arschmitz> im on a desktop too not that it should make much difference
[07:28:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... of which jsperf is one.
[07:28:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe all my tabs are open in chrome lol
[07:28:47] <arschmitz> jsperf was my only firefox tab open
[07:29:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it seems that your runs have contributed to an increased advantage in favour of $.removeData()
[07:29:24] <Wilto> Morning, all.
[07:29:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: does look that way
[07:29:30] <arschmitz> morning Wilto
[07:29:41] <Wilto> What’s the rumpus?
[07:29:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Seems like a solid advantage, but lessee the mobile space.
[07:30:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont see any mobile runs did you do some?
[07:30:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono ... I need to unearth my mobile devices ...
[07:30:44] <arschmitz> oh ok
[07:31:53] <arschmitz> ios 5 20% improvement
[07:32:21] <_|Nix|_> Nice!

[07:48:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wonder how I could test re-enhancement ...
[07:48:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just curious how much it suffers.
[07:48:37] <arschmitz> enhance them in the prepcode
[07:48:44] <arschmitz> then re-enhance in test
[07:48:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but then it gets enhanced once and re-enhanced n times ..
[07:49:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd like to run the same re-enhancemnt ...
[07:49:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ : if you only care about re-enhancement that should be fine
[07:49:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's why I was pining for a per-sample setup/teardown ...
[07:49:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I'll skip it. We really don't do that often ... 
[07:50:13] <toddmparker___> some good numbers there
[07:50:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and probably not in a tight loop, like we do the initial enhancement.
[07:50:35] <toddmparker___> on a typical page, how much of the total time is spent on buttonmarkup?
[07:50:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ very true
[07:50:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker___: We need to roll a version of jQM that does not include init ...
[07:50:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker___: Just the widgets and none of the page handling code.
[07:51:11] <toddmparker___> guess that's a question in general. is there a way to browser around the docs and measure what the most expensive operations are overall, then target those?
[07:51:17] <toddmparker___> right
[07:51:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker___: ... actually, that wouldn't help either, because for jsperf you always need two copies of the widget code anyway ...
[07:51:50] <toddmparker___> yeah, this would need a higher level tool
[07:52:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i should have caught this before when you made these changes but https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L92 is not valid for _on only for on

[07:53:55] * _|Nix|_ goes to hide under a rock
[07:54:02] <arschmitz> i ran into it before is the only reason i know
[07:54:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: And now so do I :)
[07:54:14] <arschmitz> on something else slider maybe dont remember
[07:55:14] <arschmitz> anyway im commiting a fix right now
[07:55:42] <_|Nix|_> Thanks!
[07:55:54] <arschmitz> no problem
[07:56:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im so dumb though iv looked at that line a bunch of times and wondered why it worked there and i could never get it to work
[07:57:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you would have thought i would think at some point hey maybe its really not working i should check that lol
[07:57:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker___: I think listview enhances its items via buttonMarkup so, on a page that's nothing but a list, it's probably a large chunk of time.
[07:57:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The time for that thought has arrived, so it's still a win.
[07:58:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thanks i think ill go with that lol
[07:58:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and before the release, which is even better.
[07:59:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: are you around?
[08:00:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker toddmparker_ ^^

[08:03:56] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 141b24278 15Alexander Schmitz: Fixedtoolbar: Fix incorrect event binding in _on. Fixes #5487 - Page padding should be applied before transition starts
[08:10:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: intresting so if you use _on and a widget is disabled those events wont fire it sounds like
[08:11:02] <Wilto> If I see “LF will be replaced by CRLF” one more time, I am gonna kick a hole in this laptop.
[08:11:23] <Wilto> Does anyone know how to prevent any/all line ending conversion like for serious forever and ever?
[08:11:34] <Wilto> git config core.autocrlf false isn’t sticking.
[08:16:03] <gseguin> toddmparker: unless you object I'm going to remove 1.1.2pre from the download builder
[08:16:20] <gseguin> we talked about it with johnbender yesterday
[08:17:21] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Can you run Linux in a VM and give both osx and linux access to the same directory?
[08:17:28] <Wilto> what
[08:17:47] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Well, I guess your text editor would also have to run under Linux.
[08:18:21] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: But if you install X11 for OSX, you can forward the display from within the VM to outside the VM, so the text editor will behave like a native OSX window.
[08:20:05] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Or simply use a text editor that'll allow you to set the line ending character.
[08:20:34] <Wilto> No, like, I clone a repo, don’t open anything, and git converts the line endings.
[08:20:47] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Oh, OK ...
[08:20:49] <Wilto> With autocrlf explicitly set to false.
[08:21:08] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Might be a git bug ...
[08:21:25] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Are you running the latest and greatest?
[08:21:34] <Wilto> No idea.
[08:21:47] <Wilto> git version 1.7.10.2 (Apple Git-33)
[08:21:51] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: There's also a #git channel here that might be of use.
[08:22:23] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: 1.8.0.2 here ...
[08:22:29] <Wilto> Hm.
[08:27:20] <arschmitz> Wilto: thats the latest for apple git
[08:27:37] <arschmitz> im on a brand new laptop just installed git this week and thats what i have
[08:41:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, Wilto: Isn't there some place where you can get a newer version?
[08:42:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no idea im new to mac and just got it as part of the command line tools from xcode
[08:42:22] <_|Nix|_> http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/detail?name=git-1.8.0.2-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg&can=3&q=
[08:42:58] <arschmitz> we are both on mountain lion i think (at least i am)
[08:43:23] <Wilto> On 1.8.1 now; still happening.
[08:43:41] <arschmitz> Wilto: well i guess that answers that then lol
[08:43:46] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Next stop, #git, IMO ...
[08:44:26] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Maybe the CRs in your .gitconfig are wrong and so it's not picking up the CRLF setting ;)
[08:44:36] <arschmitz> ha ha
[08:45:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i finally figured out how to get irssi connected to znc last night
[08:47:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[08:48:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am here
[08:48:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: was just looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5481
[08:49:40] <arschmitz> i saw you were assigned. I think this makes sense also is a very small performance improvment since if it closes on anything besides .ui-page-active it skips the animation
[08:50:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: was wondering if there is some downside im not thinking about?
[08:53:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't think there are downsides, so I was planning on merging
[08:54:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just need to test before doing that
[08:54:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool 
[08:54:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was thinking this will avoide page transition and panel transition going on at same time too which seems like a good thing
[08:56:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: something I want to look add is if we can set immediate to true as well
[08:56:50] <uGoMobi> we probably can
[08:56:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it is set to true there
[08:57:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/panel.js#L314
[08:57:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if the panel is not on the active page its allways immediate
[08:58:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah sorry, was looking at wrong line
[08:58:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i only know because i added that lol
[08:58:38] <uGoMobi> aha
[08:58:56] <uGoMobi> I will test later and then merge
[08:59:11] <arschmitz> if that wasent the case the transition never would complete and cause all sorts of issues if you try to open it later
[08:59:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that was one of that big batch of bug fixes i did to the original refactor branch 
[09:00:02] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:00:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: anyway cool let me know about how it tests i think it should be good 
[09:05:12] <gseguin> toddmparker: I pushed changes to the builder page. Check at the bottom of the page.
[09:05:53] <gseguin> toddmparker: Let me know if that needs rewording or anything else
[09:06:18] <toddmparker___> ok, off my call
[09:06:26] <toddmparker___> catching back up
[09:06:35] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: here i am
[09:08:57] <toddmparker___> that PR on the panel close seems like a good idea. i don't think we did testing on how it looks when you click a link in the panel. oversight there.
[09:10:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: yeah simple fix and found early so no big deal :)
[09:14:37] <johnbender> gseguin: arschmitz: _|Nix|_: agcolom: uGoMobi: is anyone interested in proofreading a blog post I finished last night?
[09:14:37] <toddmparker___> yep. open source in action.
[09:14:42] <johnbender> just need a once over before I publish
[09:14:47] <johnbender> toddmparker___: ^ take note
[09:14:50] <johnbender> shorter blog posts
[09:14:56] <johnbender> 3 nights, and done
[09:14:58] <arschmitz> johnbender: sure
[09:15:02] <toddmparker___> i'm going to spend tonight and tomorrow night looking at docs. want to start whipping that into shape
[09:15:15] <gseguin> johnbender: is it about math?
[09:15:27] <arschmitz> johnbender: im probably not best proofreader ever but ill do my best :)
[09:15:28] <toddmparker___> johnbender: sure. it's a paragraph or two, right? no math?
[09:15:40] <gseguin> toddmparker: did you see my last highlight?
[09:15:46] <toddmparker___> i'll suggest places to add typos
[09:15:55] <johnbender> toddmparker___: http://johnbender.us/2013/01/15/system-f-in-coffeescript/ don't share the link and yes it has math 
[09:15:56] <toddmparker___> newp gseguin 
[09:15:59] <johnbender> gah
[09:16:01] <johnbender> that was supposed to be a pm
[09:16:03] <johnbender> :(
[09:16:15] <gseguin> toddmparker: I pushed changes to the builder page. Check at the bottom of the page.
[09:16:20] <toddmparker___> In the Lambda Calculus, abstraction involves preceding or wrapping a term t with λx.t which captures or binds the variable x inside the term t. 
[09:16:23] <gseguin> toddmparker: unless you object I'm going to remove 1.1.2pre from the download builder
[09:16:34] <gseguin> toddmparker: Let me know if that needs rewording or anything else
[09:16:39] <toddmparker___> how can i proofread this bizness? 
[09:16:56] <toddmparker___> gseguin: lemme look
[09:17:22] <gseguin> wow we have actually multiple toddmparker in the channel!
[09:17:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker^3
[09:18:07] <arschmitz> some math there for you lol
[09:19:03] <johnbender> when you're that busy it pays to have many of you ... and one with a spatula____
[09:19:12] <gseguin> holy crap bender, I just read the intro and my head hurts already
[09:19:19] <johnbender> gseguin: oh c'mon!
[09:19:26] <johnbender> gseguin: keep reading
[09:19:35] <gseguin> I will
[09:19:43] <johnbender> gseguin: :)
[09:19:48] <johnbender> gseguin: grammar mistakes please :)
[09:20:56] <toddmparker___> gseguin: suggested re-write
[09:20:58] <toddmparker___> Notes: The zip download doesn't contain the icon and loader images, please download the [images zip file] and drop that into your folder structure { do we need to state a path? }. Please note that the zip file will contain an empty jquery.mobile.custom.css file, we're working on a fix, but simply delete that file.
[09:28:42] <arschmitz> johnbender: all the equations make me happy i dont have to use LaTeX anymore 
[09:32:25] <gseguin> toddmparker: pushed
[09:36:17] <JamesLeeds_> anyone had any problems deploying to Blackberry 10? 
[09:36:17] <JamesLeeds_> * skcin7 has quit (Client Quit)
[09:36:17] <JamesLeeds_> <JamesLeeds_> All phonegap apps just seem to have 3 squares at the top and thats sorta it
[09:36:20] <arschmitz> johnbender: last paragraph before strong and normal "The issue arises when the a combinator like identity" think you want "The issue arises when a combinator like identity"
[09:38:44] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah I caught that one thanks
[09:39:01] <arschmitz> johnbender: over all very good though
[09:40:17] <arschmitz> johnbender: did a good job of explaining everything and working down to system f which people im sure are not as familier with as Lamda Calculus
[09:40:24] <toddmparker___> gseguin: great
[09:40:48] <gseguin> toddmparker___: for master I simply link to the repo
[09:41:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I already put my question for you in a comment https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5458#issuecomment-12430064
[09:42:36] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: man, good questions
[09:43:29] <johnbender> arschmitz: thanks!
[09:43:33] <toddmparker___> one option would be to make dismissible mean that there is no way to dismiss it except thru the dev supplied buttons inside the panel
[09:43:44] <johnbender> arschmitz: I crapped that one out real fast
[09:44:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: yes that's kinda what I had in mind
[09:44:30] <toddmparker___> what do we do in popups? same option, should be the same behavior
[09:44:43] <toddmparker___> think popups close via the Esc key?
[09:44:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: popups can't be closed with swipe, only click
[09:44:52] <toddmparker___> can't prevent the back button there
[09:45:10] <toddmparker___> tap outside to close = dismissible
[09:45:19] <uGoMobi> yes
[09:45:38] <toddmparker___> i think that is the current definition of dismissible. does it prevent the tap out to close
[09:45:38] <uGoMobi> it's the same for panel
[09:45:49] <uGoMobi> right
[09:45:55] <uGoMobi> so it might be confusion
[09:45:59] <uGoMobi> confusing*
[09:46:01] <toddmparker___> but it could be expanded to prevent all the default close interations
[09:46:25] <toddmparker___> that is the question, right?
[09:46:30] <uGoMobi> yes
[09:46:34] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah but at the same time i think the fact that you didnt go into as much detail makes it more readable for people that are not superfamilier with lambda calculus and combinators made it so they couldpotentially  just follow the general idea of the blog with out fully understanding  all the details
[09:47:06] <toddmparker___> johnbender: I just finished reading through that and I could kinda follow along. Impressive.
[09:47:31] <toddmparker___> think of me as a worst case scenario reader
[09:47:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: that was the goal
[09:47:38] <johnbender> toddmparker___: amazing
[09:47:41] <johnbender> toddmparker___: alrigth
[09:47:48] <johnbender> I'm going to publish
[09:48:02] <arschmitz> johnbender: then i would say goal acheived i think you did that well
[09:48:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I think the term dismissible implies a bit that it is about all kind of interactions
[09:48:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: although, so far we only used it for preventing tap/click to close
[09:49:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think i agree if dissmissible is false swipe should not close
[09:50:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think in that case the only way to close should be a button with data-rel="close" or by calling panel('close');
[09:50:44] <uGoMobi> or swipe in the panel :)
[09:52:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i dunno i have mixed feelings about that even but id be ok with it lol
[09:52:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: well you can always set swipeClose to false :)
[09:52:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah on the project i have with them i do lol
[09:52:59] <arschmitz> i have sliders in them so no choice
[09:53:58] <toddmparker___> i agree on that. is not not dismissible, swipe won't work
[09:54:13] <toddmparker___> that's true re: swipeClose
[09:54:33] <toddmparker___> now i wish we used a better name than dimissible for both widgets
[09:54:43] <toddmparker___> if it's the click out to close only
[09:56:34] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: uGoMobi: iv been looking at thinking about this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5464 would have to do a ton of testing but it seems like this could make sense in fixedtoolbars would improve responsiveness a lot for navbars backbutton etc thoughts?
[09:57:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: gseguin: toddmparker___: Wilto: uGoMobi: agcolom: posted! http://news.ycombinator.com/newest
[09:58:22] <arschmitz> johnbender: very nice
[09:59:07] <arschmitz> johnbender: i cant remember what it was but i was looking up something the other day and 2 of your blog posts were in top 10 on google
[09:59:19] <johnbender> lol I can't imagine what
[09:59:22] <johnbender> arschmitz: erlang?
[09:59:32] <arschmitz> lol no
[09:59:33] <johnbender> that was a bad time for me lolol
[09:59:44] <arschmitz> i really dont remember 
[10:00:55] <arschmitz> i think one of the posts may have been on category theory for jquery
[10:01:15] <arschmitz> but not sure becasue we were also just talking about that the other day 
[10:01:28] <johnbender> arschmitz: interesteing
[10:01:30] <johnbender> *interesting
[10:02:09] <arschmitz> i wish i could remember i meant to tell you too 
[10:02:14] <uGoMobi> johnbender: congrats on another nice blog post!
[10:02:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I don't think dismissible is that bad as option name the way we use it now
[10:03:16] <arschmitz> johnbender: oh i know for sure one was jQuery is just a browser API
[10:03:58] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: for both popup and panel it means that no interaction outside the popup/panel will close it
[10:04:48] <uGoMobi> ok, what to do with overlay?
[10:04:52] <johnbender> arschmitz: :)
[10:05:08] <uGoMobi> should swipe on page close an overlay panel?
[10:05:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i say no
[10:05:58] <arschmitz> consistancy 
[10:06:13] <uGoMobi> consistent with what in this case?
[10:06:46] <arschmitz> push and reveal 
[10:06:59] <arschmitz> assuming we make dismissible ignore swipe 
[10:07:42] <uGoMobi> but I am talking about when dismissible is set to true (the default)
[10:07:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh ok sorry
[10:08:00] <uGoMobi> in that case swipe on page (content/toolbars) will close the panel
[10:08:16] <uGoMobi> but I am thinking about making an exception for overlay
[10:08:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just curious but why?
[10:08:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: whats the logic?
[10:09:05] <uGoMobi> because with reveal and push it is that you drag/swipe the content back
[10:09:17] <uGoMobi> but with overlay the content stays in place
[10:09:31] <arschmitz> so its more a visual then a function thing
[10:09:44] <arschmitz> does it visually make sense
[10:09:52] <uGoMobi> yes
[10:10:07] <uGoMobi> or better.... intuition
[10:10:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think i would still make it close on swipe 
[10:10:18] <arschmitz> on page
[10:10:27] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:10:41] <arschmitz> if tapping on a page would close it i think swiping should too
[10:10:51] <johnbender> lol apparently no one is on the internet today :)
[10:10:52] <uGoMobi> that's a good point
[10:11:08] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: i think i agree
[10:11:19] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah the internet took the day off didnt you hear?
[10:11:32] <toddmparker___> the overlay looks to slide over, so swiping it back off feels ok to me
[10:11:46] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:11:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah your kinda throwing it off the screen with your swipe
[10:11:53] <uGoMobi> thanks all :)
[10:12:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: anyt time :)
[10:19:17] <gseguin> johnbender: I pushed branch grunt-0.4
[10:19:36] <gseguin> johnbender: feel free to look and comment if you have time
[10:20:52] <johnbender> gseguin: will do
[10:21:02] <johnbender> gseguin: probably after the gym/lunch
[10:21:10] <gseguin> johnbender: it's nowhere close to complete
[10:24:57] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[11:15:43] <toddmparker___> hey all - i need to pick the kids up a school but i'll be on later. uGoMobi / arschmitz - i'll be looking at the new demos tonight and tomorrow evening. want to try and get that into shape a bit. if you're around, we can jam on it
[11:15:59] <toddmparker___> talk to you all later
[12:09:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: todmparker_: toddmparker: I will be around tonight and tomorrow if i dont seem to be on here just shoot me an email and ill jump on. 
[12:14:30] <agcolom> hey guys, had an idea for the demos...
[12:14:49] <arschmitz> agcolom: cool please share :)
[12:15:20] <agcolom> now please don't shoot me if it's too hard to do, but I think it'd be really cool...
[12:15:49] <agcolom> if you have an iPhone or an iPod Touch, you'll know what I mean...
[12:16:06] <agcolom> and I thought that would make a great panel demo...
[12:16:25] <agcolom> so you know on the iPhone/iPod Touch how you can list artists or songs...
[12:17:23] <agcolom> then you have the alphabet on the right (a bit like on a very narrow panel) that acts as a shortcut to the list separator for that letter...
[12:18:01] <agcolom> could we implement this (maybe using silent scroll) ?
[12:18:06] <agcolom> as a demo?
[12:18:22] <agcolom> I can do a screen shot if that would help...
[12:18:59] <agcolom> what do you think?
[12:20:28] * agcolom is thinking that arschmitz is now building this and will come up with the demo in no time!!!???
[12:21:06] <arschmitz> agcolom: thats a cool demo 
[12:21:31] <arschmitz> agcolom: i think we could do something like that pretty easy id have to look into it
[12:22:05] <agcolom> cool :-) Thought about it this morning when looking for an artist name... 
[12:22:41] <agcolom> then that'd be a great example for my talk in Vienna :-)
[12:22:54] <agcolom> have a great weekend...
[12:23:12] <arschmitz> agcolom: maybe ill make it this weekend i think toddmparker: and i and maybe uGoMobi: are going to try and work on demos this weekend
[12:23:28] <arschmitz> agcolom: you too hopefully we will have a lot fo good ones for vienna !
[12:43:42] <agcolom> yes, I have to complete one final assignment for my PG cert on the 4th Feb, then I'll concentrate on the talk...
[13:23:54] <RWhitbeck> agcolom you're going to vienna?
[13:34:48] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: yes! a bit of a last minute...
[13:35:07] <RWhitbeck> Nice what are you giving a talk on?
[13:38:56] <agcolom> Good UI design principles with jQuery Mobile
[13:39:49] <agcolom> So I'm planning on something not too technical (I'm sure there will be plenty of that in the other talks) and lots of demos.

[13:55:00] <arschmitz> Wilto: Think i still have a Shipyard smashed Blueberry i promissed you 
[13:55:08] <arschmitz> Wilto: did you ever find one to try?
[13:56:28] <arschmitz> agcolom: already have a working demo of the filter bar on the side
[13:58:01] <agcolom> hey! you're genius ;-)
[13:58:22] <arschmitz> agcolom: gota polish it up a bit but its working
[13:58:46] <agcolom> that's awesome news!
[13:59:15] <agcolom> Wilto: arschmitz would you know what is making a deep trumpet noise on my computer (Mac Book Pro)?
[13:59:33] <RWhitbeck> arschmitz why do we have to wait so long we suggested this demo 2 hours ago GOSH!!!
[13:59:41] <agcolom> or what could do that? ^
[13:59:53] <arschmitz> agcolom: since this demo is the first thing i EVER made on a mac i have no idea lol
[14:00:14] <arschmitz> my mac make sounds all the time and i NEVER know what they are lol 
[14:00:42] <Wilto> Hah, no idea, sorry.
[14:00:46] <agcolom> I've had this mac for about 3 years I think and this is new noise!
[14:01:01] <arschmitz> agcolom: once i polish it up a bit ill put it online for you to see
[14:01:15] <agcolom> fantastic! Thank you! 
[14:02:28] <arschmitz> agcolom: im sure you will be asleep by then lol 
[14:02:31] <arschmitz> but tomorrow 
[14:03:31] <agcolom> perfect ! I'll check tomorrow :-)
[14:04:07] <Wilto> No WP7.8 issues to report so far.
[14:04:18] <arschmitz> Wilto: lol
[14:04:55] <Wilto> Unsurprisingly.
[14:35:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[14:36:01] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[14:36:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! When you added options inline and mini to the button widget, why didn't you add them to the options at the top? (I'm assuming you added those).
[14:37:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I haven't actually checked the git blame.
[14:37:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think this have to do with toolbars
[14:37:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But the point is, _create() was doing inline = o.inline || this.element.jqmData( "inline" ); and then calling buttonMarkup( { ..., inline: inline, ... });
[14:37:53] <uGoMobi> making buttons in toolbars always default to mini
[14:38:05] <uGoMobi> don't have the code in front of me
[14:38:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but that was the only way to make that work
[14:38:46] <uGoMobi> ignore options set in button widget and always set them mini and inline
[14:39:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree it's far from ideal
[14:39:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but there's no code in the button widget that checks wether it's inside a toolbar or not ...
[14:39:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you think we can use _setOptions instead to make that work
[14:39:46] <uGoMobi> hang on ... I open the file
[14:41:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see buttonMarkup
[14:42:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You mean js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js?
[14:43:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[14:43:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What should I be looking for?
[14:43:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the point was that if we set the option in button widget we could not make the logic in buttonMarkup work
[14:44:05] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15marcus30 opened issue #5489: Setting role property to 'dialog' in changePage throws error  02http://git.io/typQUg
[14:44:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the logic to make buttons in toolbars default to mini and inline
[14:44:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let me look for the PR I created long time ago
[14:45:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4363
[14:46:26] <uGoMobi> and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4291
[14:51:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is there a unit test to make sure that a button inside a header/footer is mini and inline?
[14:52:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure
[14:52:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... because I put mini and inline back into options, and I put a button on the old docs root page into the footer, and it's mini and inline ...
[14:53:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and if you set mini false and inline false for that button?
[14:54:18] <_|Nix|_> Oh, wait - that's a link, not a button. NM. Lemme try a button.
[14:55:09] <_|Nix|_> OK. It's not mini.
[14:55:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am really in favor of changing this
[14:55:40] <uGoMobi> options should be set according widget factory
[14:59:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, on master I added <form action="#" method="get"><button name="Blah" value="Blah"></button></form> to the footer in the old docs index, and it results in a button that's mini, but not inline.
[14:59:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I thought it was supposed to be both mini /and/ inline.
[15:00:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah it should be
[15:00:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I don't get it. Where do you set that the button should be mini?
[15:01:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The button doesn't have the ui-mini class.
[15:01:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think it's only mini because of CSS scoping.
[15:02:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js#L94
[15:02:11] <uGoMobi> and the CSS
[15:02:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes it's a combination
[15:02:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is a lot of CSS to override things for when it is inside a toolbar
[15:03:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's something I want to work on for 1.4
[15:03:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OKOK, but how does o.inline come to be true?
[15:03:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Somebody somewhere has to call .buttonMarkup({inline: true})
[15:04:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: 1px drop on transition is back!
[15:05:23] <arschmitz> :(
[15:05:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I think o.inline is undefined, because neither ui-btn-block nor ui-btn-inline are being added.
[15:06:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's the idea... we don't add the inline and mini classes
[15:07:00] <uGoMobi> but there is CSS for buttons in toolbars that give them the inline and mini style
[15:07:17] <uGoMobi> so it's really an ugly way of doing this
[15:08:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.button.css#L11
[15:08:17] <uGoMobi> that sets the buttons to inline
[15:08:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but then the CSS is only working for mini, but it's not working for inline.
[15:08:32] <uGoMobi> without using class ui-btn-inline
[15:08:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.button.css#L16
[15:08:59] <uGoMobi> and same for mini
[15:09:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, it's not working because I have <div class="ui-footer"><form><button> ...
[15:09:46] <uGoMobi> right the form tag
[15:09:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and the rule is .ui-footer > .ui-button
[15:10:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. It breaks the immediate parent-child relationship.
[15:10:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yet somehow it works for mini.
[15:12:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The reason you couldn't make it work with options is because options have to be set to null if they're considered unset.
[15:12:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for mini we dont use >
[15:12:15] <uGoMobi> in the selector
[15:12:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly
[15:12:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The solution is to copy this.options and remove those keys that are null.
[15:12:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and remove initSelector while you're at it. Then, pass the result to .buttonMarkup().
[15:13:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we had to use > in the selector for inline otherwise it breaks slider and flip toggle
[15:13:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, that means that if you put a header button inside a form you have to explicitly make it inline.
[15:13:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No automagic inlining for you if you do that.
[15:14:08] <uGoMobi> yeah so this isn't a good way to do this at all
[15:14:52] <uGoMobi> I am not sure if we will keep using option inline
[15:15:33] <uGoMobi> we were thinking about just let people add the class in the markup
[15:16:09] <uGoMobi> but not sure if that's already going to happen in 1.4
[15:16:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but they can't just add the class to a button because the button gets wrapped in the div which is the visual button.
[15:17:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know
[15:17:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The native button gets hidden.
[15:17:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but another thing we want to do is making sure classes that are set for the element are set for the wrapper we create as well
[15:18:15] <uGoMobi> there is a ticket for that
[15:19:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, so we transfer the classes? OK ...
[15:19:49] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:21:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, for now, I'll copy and scrub the options and pass that to buttonMarkup. 
[15:21:11] <uGoMobi> if we don't get rid of those styling options yet it would be great if we could make the widget set the option to inline or mini when a button is in a toolbar
[15:21:27] <uGoMobi> but page.section is not a real widget
[15:21:51] <uGoMobi> and I don't know if we could make that work with _setOptions
[15:21:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We have similar interaction between checkbox and controlgroup ...
[15:22:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good point
[15:22:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll see how we did it there.
[15:22:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Whenever there is an interaction like this, you need to start worrying about the order in which widgets are instantiated.
[15:22:44] <uGoMobi> true
[15:24:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's probably not good for performance if we make the button wiidget check if a button has a toolbar div as parent/ancestor
[15:25:10] <uGoMobi> and we would have to move anchors from the buttonMarkup initSelector
[15:25:29] <uGoMobi> and make them use the button widget as well
[15:28:55] <_|Nix|_> OK, so I fixed the button widget as well as the button markup ... however, I think I have to re-run the performance tests, because the resulting code is slightly different from the one I tested.
[15:29:17] <_|Nix|_> .... but I think that will be a quest for another day. I gotta go to bed. L8R all!
[15:29:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good night

[17:30:16] <JamesLeeds_> anyone any ideas on these soft grey shadows behind buttons and select lists on BlackBerry 10? 
[17:32:53] <JamesLeeds_> Ah its a bug with box shadows
[17:33:02] <uGoMobi> JamesLeeds_: do you use BB10 Dev Alpha Simulator?
[17:33:09] <JamesLeeds_> Real device
[17:33:12] <uGoMobi> JamesLeeds_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5446
[17:33:38] <JamesLeeds_> ah, no this is on an actual DevAlpha with latest software
[17:33:54] <JamesLeeds_> if I remove the box shadow classes like ui-bar-a .ui-shadow its gone
[17:34:52] <uGoMobi> JamesLeeds_: there will probably be a problem with ui-focus as well
[17:35:12] <JamesLeeds_> yeah possibly
[17:36:13] <JamesLeeds_> I think I'll just remove box shadow for now
[17:37:03] <uGoMobi> I will ask JasonDScott___ (from RIM) if BB is going to fix this before final release
[17:37:50] <toddmparker___> hey-o
[17:39:26] <toddmparker___> I'm getting a newer BB10 device next week so I can test if you don't hear back on that opacity issue
[17:39:50] <JamesLeeds_> This is on Dev Alpha B
[17:40:17] <uGoMobi> they used box-shadow in the JQM BB10 theme http://blackberry.github.com/jQueryMobile-BB10-Theme/kitchenSink/slider_dark.html

[18:23:35] <arschmitz> Cool
[18:23:52] <arschmitz> I'm working on a demo agcolom asked for
[18:29:12] <arschmitz> making the little alphabet bar like in itunes to jump to a letter to use with listview autodividers
[18:32:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: turns out its actually really really easy to do.
[18:32:23] <toddmparker___> nice!
[18:32:54] <toddmparker___> there was on in the intel widgets somewhere but i'd like ot see what you come up with. will probably be simpler/cleaner
[18:32:58] <toddmparker___> sweet
[18:37:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker: cool its done just cleaning it up a bit and putting in demos
[19:26:49] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: is the scroll jump to in the demos folder?
[19:27:01] <toddmparker___> wondering how to do some anchoring
[19:27:15] <arschmitz> should be did that forever ago lol
[19:27:25] <arschmitz> ill have to check to make sure ha ha
[19:28:03] <toddmparker___> ok, just looking for a demo to copy the syntax
[19:28:18] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: just give me a sec to push this demo i just finished and ill look

[19:53:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: working on incorperating into demos and then making a demo to show its use right now
[20:04:39] <toddmparker___> hey cool
[20:05:01] <toddmparker___> if your screen isn't tall, the letters overlap tho
[20:05:37] <toddmparker___> no rush on the anchor stuff, but just give me a shout when it's added
[20:07:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i noticed that havent thought of a way around it they are only 10px font size already lol
[20:08:48] <arschmitz> toddmparker___damn alphabet has too many letters lol
[20:20:29] <toddmparker___> dang
[20:20:40] <toddmparker___> yeah, we can try to finesse somehow
[20:21:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker___ yeah i was going to see what uGoMobi: had for suggestions
[20:22:17] <toddmparker___> looks great tho
[20:22:32] <arschmitz> thanks real simple 4 css rules and 4 event bindings
[20:23:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: first thing i ever made on a mac lol
[20:23:30] <toddmparker___> taks a while to get used to a mac. like 6 months honestly
[20:23:46] <arschmitz> yeah iv just been doing everything command line
[20:23:47] <toddmparker___> but once you do, you realize just how noisy the UI is on a PC
[20:24:01] <toddmparker___> mac is a hacker's paradise
[20:24:24] <arschmitz> iv used linux commandline only for years on all my vps's
[20:24:59] <arschmitz> so once i open a terminal its all good lol
[20:26:01] <toddmparker___> cool. the retina screen is just so damn good
[20:26:27] <arschmitz> yeah i really like it so far and the pro retina is just such a nice laptop too i love it so much better then my old PINK vaio i stole from my wife ha ha ha
[20:26:55] <arschmitz> not missing having a pink laptop at all lol

[20:27:17] <arschmitz> yup
[20:27:51] <arschmitz> i had it at the dev summit lol but with a vinyl cover to hide the pink lol
[20:28:11] <toddmparker___> nice
[20:28:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: so matt said all the windows phones came in thats cool
[20:28:40] <toddmparker___> yeah. we got a ton
[20:28:53] <toddmparker___> i'll start sending 'em out to everyone
[20:29:15] <toddmparker___> been trying to make a flat list of the widgets people might want to find for the new demos site - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets.html
[20:29:28] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: if you guys are not too busy some day coming up id love to come down and harass all you filimenteers lol could pick one up in person
[20:29:51] <toddmparker___> i'd like to have a quick reference where I can see all the common permutations of a widgets
[20:30:15] <toddmparker___> and we can have a separate place where we have more custom demos.  cross-link 'em up
[20:30:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: yeah that looks like a good list
[20:30:29] <toddmparker___> see buttons: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/buttons/
[20:31:02] <toddmparker___> that combines all the button pages into one except for the buttons in grids
[20:31:14] <toddmparker___> so it shows all the options w/minimal text
[20:31:31] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: yeah a great copy and paste page like we had talked about
[20:31:31] <toddmparker___> i always have to hunt around to find an option
[20:31:39] <toddmparker___> right
[20:32:11] <toddmparker___> have some text, but not so much it overlaps the API docs
[20:32:31] <toddmparker___> there is a link out to the api docs too
[20:32:33] <arschmitz> yeah want to duplicate as little as possible
[20:32:42] <toddmparker___> (see upper right)
[20:33:09] <arschmitz> yeah i think thats a good template for how to do a basic widget page
[20:35:04] <toddmparker___> cool. anything missing? did i go too far anywhere?
[20:35:44] <toddmparker___> if you're a markup jockey, you can just copy paste your way through this and not read the api docs
[20:36:07] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: i dont think you missed anything off the top of my head
[20:36:24] <toddmparker___> data-iconshadow	
[20:36:26] <toddmparker___> woof
[20:36:34] <toddmparker___> few q's for ya
[20:36:41] <arschmitz> but it does remind me of something. it would be good to have an option to have a horizontal controlgroup be full width
[20:36:46] <toddmparker___> on that widget list...
[20:36:54] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: true
[20:37:03] <toddmparker___> display: table cell?
[20:37:17] <arschmitz> toddmparker___ iv already done it by calling grid in the controlgroup widget
[20:37:27] <arschmitz> hold on i have a link
[20:37:32] <toddmparker___> that should have been the default and the current would need inline
[20:38:25] <arschmitz> http://billdodgewholesale.com/ the special and certified checkboxes
[20:38:35] <arschmitz> on the right hand side
[20:39:22] <arschmitz> its super easy too just add an option data-full-width and if true call grid() on the control group
[20:40:03] <arschmitz> i just wrote an extension to controlgroup to do it
[20:40:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: yeah probably would have made more sense to make fullwidth the default
[20:41:06] <arschmitz> and inline do what it does now
[20:44:14] <toddmparker___> right
[20:44:29] <toddmparker___> think it was tricky to do, css-wise 2+ years ago
[20:44:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: yeah i can imagine
[20:44:57] <arschmitz> i like with this that grid takes care of it all lol
[20:46:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: oh sorry you said you had some questions though?
[20:46:28] <toddmparker___> right
[20:46:58] <toddmparker___> on this: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets.html
[20:47:36] <toddmparker___> first item is "autocomplete" which is a stretch but I was going to cover the listview filter thing and link to the remote autocomplete demo
[20:47:53] <arschmitz> ok
[20:47:59] <toddmparker___> take it from the perspective of folks who don't know what we have, but what they want
[20:48:08] <toddmparker___> does that make sense?
[20:48:11] <arschmitz> yes
[20:48:18] <toddmparker___> same with accordion = grouped collapsibles
[20:48:27] <arschmitz> yeah
[20:48:33] <arschmitz> people are familier with ui 
[20:48:39] <toddmparker___> right
[20:48:44] <arschmitz> and so ui names make sense like accordian
[20:48:49] <toddmparker___> cool
[20:49:00] <toddmparker___> next, wondering about header, footer, toolbar
[20:49:12] <toddmparker___> I have all 3 listed -- combine into one?
[20:49:31] <arschmitz> probably
[20:49:40] <toddmparker___> just keep header and footer, drop toolbars? or just keep toolbars and cover header and footer there
[20:49:55] <arschmitz> i was thinking just toolbars but ...
[20:50:02] <toddmparker___> what would you be looking for if a n00b
[20:50:07] <arschmitz> im not sure people looking for header would go to toolbars
[20:50:13] <toddmparker___> right
[20:50:23] <arschmitz> so i think keep header footer ditch toolbar
[20:50:43] <toddmparker___> ok, cool
[20:51:12] <toddmparker___> changed
[20:51:17] <arschmitz> awesome
[20:51:19] <toddmparker___> oh, forms.
[20:51:51] <toddmparker___> keep them as is in alpha order by widget or prefix with form: 
[20:51:56] <toddmparker___> form: checkbox
[20:51:59] <toddmparker___> etc.
[20:52:32] <arschmitz> i was almost thinking leave as is but then under form have a list of form widgets also
[20:52:48] <toddmparker___> yeah, was thinking that too
[20:52:55] <arschmitz> because i could see people doing either
[20:52:57] <toddmparker___> have a "form elements" item
[20:52:59] <toddmparker___> right
[20:53:01] <arschmitz> yup
[20:53:14] <toddmparker___> that can be the gallery we have now
[20:53:19] <toddmparker___> ok, makes sense
[20:53:36] <toddmparker___> i sort of prefixed sliders and tables this way
[20:53:41] <arschmitz> oh did you happen to notice my comment about coming to boston above ??
[20:53:51] <toddmparker___> newp...when?
[20:54:18] <arschmitz> when ever you think you filamenteers may have a not too busy day for me to come harass you all
[20:54:37] <arschmitz> figured save you on shipping the WP lol
[20:54:48] <toddmparker___> that would be great. i'll hand you a phone
[20:55:02] <arschmitz> cool
[20:55:19] <toddmparker___> i'll be in CA for a few days next week so either late next week or the week after would work
[20:55:32] <toddmparker___> be great to hang out. 
[20:55:37] <arschmitz> week after will be better for me kinda busy next week
[20:55:41] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[20:55:43] <toddmparker___> i owe you a zillion beers
[20:55:45] <arschmitz> lol
[20:55:48] <arschmitz> i owe wilto one
[20:55:52] <toddmparker___> ok, let's plan on that
[20:55:57] <arschmitz> awesome
[20:56:01] <toddmparker___> wilto?! naw.
[20:56:06] <toddmparker___> that guy...
[20:56:30] <arschmitz> its a 9% blueberry bear made by shipyard here in portland
[20:56:39] <arschmitz> lol
[20:56:45] <arschmitz> beer*
[20:57:24] <arschmitz> just let me know what day works good for you that week and ill plan on coming down
[20:57:35] <toddmparker___> btw - that grid + controlgroup thing would be a nice demo too
[20:57:48] <arschmitz> yeah ill whip it up at some point
[20:57:52] <arschmitz> maybe tomorrow
[20:57:54] <toddmparker___> maybe we can add that officially at some point, helpful
[20:57:58] <toddmparker___> sweet
[20:58:18] <arschmitz> i think this weekend id like to get some real work done on demos 
[20:58:39] <toddmparker___> so i'll keep working on folding the simple widget pages under widgets
[20:58:49] <toddmparker___> anything customized should stay a demo
[20:58:52] <toddmparker___> we can cross-link
[20:58:57] <toddmparker___> yeah, me too
[20:59:17] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: yeah i think that makes the most sense keep the default and custom stuff seperate
[20:59:26] <toddmparker___> i have family stuff all day, but have time tomorrow night to jam for a few hours
[20:59:56] <arschmitz> cool ill be around both probably baby shower is tomorrow so free time for me ha ha 
[21:00:00] <toddmparker___> right - i want a simpel copy/paste reference for widgets to show 'em off and make testing easy
[21:00:08] <arschmitz> yup
[21:00:13] <toddmparker___> for you?
[21:00:20] <arschmitz> yeah
[21:00:28] <toddmparker___> hey, that's great
[21:00:38] <toddmparker___> sorry if i forgot...when is your wife due?
[21:00:41] <arschmitz> yup getting real close
[21:00:46] <arschmitz> march 10th
[21:00:51] <toddmparker___> zowie
[21:01:16] <toddmparker___> good for you. kids are a blast. except for the sleep deprivation
[21:01:34] <toddmparker___> savor the fact that your brain works now, won't for many more years
[21:01:34] <arschmitz> lol thats ok i only sleep 5 hours a less or night already lol
[21:01:49] <toddmparker___> yeah, but imagine those 5 interrupted
[21:01:56] <arschmitz> lol true
[21:02:26] <toddmparker___> my youngest is almost 3 so i'm getting a lot more sleep now
[21:02:37] <arschmitz> as for demos i really want to get a format for FAQ set with uGoMobi: so we can start transfering random stuff from current docs to there
[21:02:37] <toddmparker___> but it's all good
[21:02:49] <toddmparker___> yeah, was thinking about that
[21:02:59] <toddmparker___> i really like that idea
[21:03:10] <arschmitz> its a good place for random pieces of info that have no real home
[21:03:24] <arschmitz> like all the notes and considderations and stuff in the current docs
[21:03:27] <toddmparker___> as long as we're happy with a markup pattern, we can always tweak styles
[21:03:36] <arschmitz> true
[21:03:51] <toddmparker___> is that in master?
[21:03:56] <arschmitz> i need to look at it again tomorrow what i have now isnt good
[21:04:01] <toddmparker___> if not, maybe toss a folder in
[21:04:11] <arschmitz> no i never pushed it because it was kinda rough
[21:04:20] <toddmparker___> call it...faq? tips?
[21:04:24] <arschmitz> i have it on my server though i think
[21:04:28] <toddmparker___> ok
[21:04:32] <arschmitz> i think faq go with what people know
[21:04:40] <toddmparker___> we can always keep it simple for authoring
[21:05:16] <toddmparker___> have a H1 for the question with a class on it we can style (add a rule/bg)
[21:05:23] <arschmitz> http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/faq/docs/demos/faq/
[21:05:29] <toddmparker___> and use headings and p's for the content
[21:05:41] <arschmitz> yeah i think that would be best
[21:05:52] <arschmitz> only the first one works i think lol
[21:05:56] <toddmparker___> http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/faq/docs/demos/faq/changing-css-on-form-element-does-not-work.html
[21:06:21] <arschmitz> yup that one
[21:06:29] <toddmparker___> maybe put wrappers around the Q and A sections
[21:06:37] <toddmparker___> we can style it up from there
[21:06:44] <arschmitz> sounds like a plan
[21:06:50] <toddmparker___> cool
[21:07:04] <toddmparker___> i flagged a few pages for that in the content inventory
[21:07:27] <arschmitz> once we have that we can just start going through and transfering things in there and removing from docs as we go
[21:07:33] <arschmitz> awesome 
[21:07:37] <toddmparker___> intro  |  widgets  |  demos  |  faqs
[21:07:52] <toddmparker___> yeah, let's keep it simple so we can focus on good content
[21:08:02] <toddmparker___> css is easy later with decent structure
[21:08:07] <arschmitz> i agree
[21:08:44] <arschmitz> so we got a thank you on twitter earlier for being so quick to fix issues
[21:10:47] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15toddparker pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/4QXgDQ
[21:10:47] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14546a08e 15toddparker: Demos: Button updates
[21:10:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker__: always a good thing to be recognised for
[21:10:53] <toddmparker___> i saw that. awesome work on that
[21:11:15] <toddmparker___> yeah. being on the ball with triage is really good for the project.
[21:11:24] <toddmparker___> i really appreciate your help there
[21:11:32] <arschmitz> hes been submitting a lot of 1.3 issues and has great issue descriptions so want to encourage him lol
[21:12:03] <toddmparker___> yeah, his reports are great. if he does much more, we should recruit him
[21:12:31] <arschmitz> lol yeah
[21:13:48] <arschmitz> i think its one of our really good strengths in generl we really watch the issue tracker
[21:14:07] <arschmitz> though can you imaginge how out of control the issues would be if we didnt?
[21:15:18] <toddmparker___> oh, i know. been there
[21:16:09] <arschmitz> just shows how many people use the frameowrk and how popular it really is
[21:16:36] <arschmitz> kinda makes you feel good about the work you do lol 
[21:17:03] <toddmparker___> yeah, this is a very fun project
[21:17:14] <arschmitz> for sure
[21:17:26] <toddmparker___> i keep stumbling over jQM sites now as I browser
[21:17:38] <arschmitz> me too i love it
[21:17:41] <toddmparker___> once we get through 1.4, i'll be a happy camper
[21:18:03] <arschmitz> macaroni grill's mobile site is now lol
[21:18:14] <toddmparker___> we have the ability to really refine this
[21:18:20] <toddmparker___> yeah?
[21:18:30] <arschmitz> for sure im really excited
[21:18:37] <toddmparker___> if you find good ones, submit 'em to jqmgallery.com
[21:18:43] <arschmitz> yup noticed when i was in dc for dev summit
[21:19:05] <arschmitz> my parents banks mobile site and app are too
[21:19:15] <toddmparker___> oh, nice
[21:19:34] <arschmitz> yeah thought it was cool tosee a banking app
[21:19:48] <toddmparker___> so many sites are still on 1.0
[21:19:58] <toddmparker___> old spinner
[21:20:08] <arschmitz> yeah 
[21:20:23] <arschmitz> im really excited for 1.4
[21:20:36] <toddmparker___> me too
[21:20:39] <toddmparker___> clean house
[21:20:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ is still lobbying for calling it 2.0 lol
[21:21:09] <toddmparker___> hopefully, we won't break so much stuff
[21:21:23] <toddmparker___> but our mindset should be 2.0
[21:22:05] <arschmitz> yeah one benefit of 2.0 is it would line us up with ui and core lol
[21:22:27] <toddmparker___> true
[21:22:49] <arschmitz> i had someone complaining to me like a month ago about the 3 projects version numbers not lining up
[21:23:09] <toddmparker___> really?
[21:23:12] <arschmitz> yup
[21:23:38] <toddmparker___> the core + UI is more of a coincidence than anything else
[21:23:43] <toddmparker___> but i can kinda see that
[21:23:49] <arschmitz> for sure
[21:24:10] <arschmitz> they were complaining about core being 1.8 and ui 1.9
[21:24:36] <toddmparker___> the 1.9/2.0 split will complicate things
[21:24:53] <arschmitz> yeah
[21:25:03] <toddmparker___> i'm all for version inflation
[21:25:07] <toddmparker___> it's the rage
[21:25:08] <arschmitz> what is our plan on that?
[21:25:23] <toddmparker___> my chrome is Version 24.0.1312.52
[21:25:38] <toddmparker___> for versioning?
[21:25:41] <arschmitz> im on 25 now at work
[21:25:45] <toddmparker___> heh
[21:25:50] <arschmitz> no for support on 1.9 / 2.0
[21:26:04] <arschmitz> chrome 25 changes the whole look of the inspector
[21:26:10] <toddmparker___> we're on 1.9 now, right?
[21:26:28] <arschmitz> moving too it i wanted to run a few more tests
[21:26:28] <toddmparker___> i'd like to push for 2.0 since that will be lighter
[21:26:48] <arschmitz> so degrade ie7-8 to c?
[21:26:52] <toddmparker___> and maybe push for a version of core that has some option modules out
[21:27:06] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: eventually, yeah
[21:27:21] <toddmparker___> hopefully, after 1.4, C will be a lot prettier
[21:27:42] <arschmitz> i need to start working for a compny not stuck on ie7 lol
[21:27:51] <toddmparker___> i want to sit on the smallest version of core we can
[21:28:00] <toddmparker___> yeah, that is still a thing
[21:28:14] <arschmitz> yeah best to keep weight down since we add a lot
[21:28:34] <toddmparker___> on mobile IE9 is the baseline since WP7.5 is based on that
[21:28:50] <arschmitz> xp kills businesses because ie9 is vista +
[21:29:02] <toddmparker___> older versions are just desktop which we support, but...
[21:29:09] <arschmitz> yeah
[21:29:15] <toddmparker___> yeah? ugh
[21:29:30] <arschmitz> yup thats why 9 adomption rate is still low
[21:30:17] <toddmparker___> IE is the least of my worries. ANDROID
[21:30:23] <arschmitz> ugh
[21:30:40] <arschmitz> i cant belive they droped replacestate after 2.3?
[21:30:48] <arschmitz> what kinda bs is that?
[21:32:29] <arschmitz> also shocked we didnt notice before now lol
[22:03:23] <toddmparker___> android is a hot mess
[22:05:13] <arschmitz> for sure
[22:05:21] <toddmparker___> adding some custom fonts to see if i can clean up the design a bit here
[22:05:26] <toddmparker___> this is just FPO
[22:05:51] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15toddparker pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/K8l3JQ
[22:05:51] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 1403e44bf 15toddparker: Demos: A more custom look and feel
[22:06:11] <toddmparker___> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/buttons/
[22:06:28] <toddmparker___> funny how adding a custom font really improves things
[22:06:56] <arschmitz> wow yeah
[22:07:00] <arschmitz> thats much much nicer
[22:07:14] <arschmitz> i like that a lot
[22:07:18] <toddmparker___> cool
[22:07:28] <arschmitz> we should use that in the whole demos
[22:07:36] <toddmparker___> needs a lot fo work, but i'd like to move in that direction
[22:07:44] <toddmparker___> yeah, that's the plan
[22:07:48] <arschmitz> looks so much nicer
[22:08:06] <toddmparker___> open sans is nice. adobe open sourced it
[22:08:15] <arschmitz> nice
[22:08:40] <toddmparker___> be good to do some demos that pop in a google font for the UI itself
[22:09:35] <arschmitz> yeah
[22:09:48] <arschmitz> font demos in general would be good
[22:10:39] <arschmitz> im hoping with the new demos we can encourage people to do a lot more custom stuff and not just use all default styles 
[22:19:11] <toddmparker___> exactlt
[22:19:14] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15toddparker pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/wj4W5Q

[22:24:48] <arschmitz> goodnight
