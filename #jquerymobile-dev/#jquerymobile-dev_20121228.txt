[05:17:36] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi:
[05:17:46] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:17:59] <arschmitz> did you see the PR from Changsuk?
[05:18:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no I didn't really looked at it yet
[05:19:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not sure i like the naming convention but it is a pretty substantial performance difference
[05:20:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I just had a quick look at it and yes... looks like a very useful change
[05:20:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jsperf.com/jquery-window-vs-window
[05:21:00] <arschmitz> just as a test case for the difference
[05:21:06] <uGoMobi> wow
[05:21:10] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:21:19] <arschmitz> its pretty substantial
[05:21:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I also saw what you guys were talking about yesterday
[05:21:28] <uGoMobi> $.fn.data
[05:21:37] <arschmitz> yeah thats a big gain too
[05:21:38] <uGoMobi> niceee
[05:21:53] <uGoMobi> I like that
[05:21:53] <arschmitz> these are small enough we could easily land for 1.3 even
[05:22:03] <arschmitz> i think anyway
[05:22:54] <uGoMobi> I can even live with the naming convention
[05:23:17] <uGoMobi> no idea what would be better name
[05:23:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont like the second dollar sign
[05:23:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think it should be $.mobile.window
[05:23:40] <arschmitz> thats all
[05:24:14] <arschmitz> i think the first one already tells you its going to be a jQuery object
[05:24:43] <uGoMobi> isn't that a problem with reserved names?
[05:25:30] <arschmitz> i dont think so but a good point
[05:25:54] <arschmitz> the jsperf i had was in strict mode and did $.window 
[05:25:58] <uGoMobi> if it's not a problem I agree we should leave the second $ out
[05:26:00] <arschmitz> with no issue
[05:26:07] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[05:26:44] <arschmitz> but i think it should be $.mobile.window not $.window so we dont polute the jQuery name space any more
[05:27:31] <uGoMobi> yes
[05:27:49] <arschmitz> i wish we had speed benchmarks for JQM so we could see how big a difference these would make overall lol
[05:27:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I pushed the changes for slider and rangeslider
[05:28:04] <arschmitz> just the css right?
[05:28:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[05:28:19] <arschmitz> not johnbenders suggestions
[05:28:20] <arschmitz> ok
[05:28:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: small changes in JS
[05:28:34] <uGoMobi> removed the dash from rangeslider
[05:28:36] <arschmitz> yeah for wrappers and such i just meant johnbenders stuff
[05:28:57] <uGoMobi> yes and removed the wrapper from slider
[05:29:04] <uGoMobi> not johnbender his feedback
[05:29:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool ill push his stuff in a little bit
[05:29:34] <arschmitz> ran our of time last night spent too much time shoveling and snowblowing 
[05:29:37] <uGoMobi> I am thinking about what unit tests we need
[05:29:46] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:29:53] <uGoMobi> more snow today?
[05:29:54] <arschmitz> i had a list i made a while ago but need to find it 
[05:30:04] <arschmitz> nope stoped sometime over night
[05:30:14] <arschmitz> but another 2-4 inches tomorrow lol
[05:30:20] <uGoMobi> aha
[05:30:23] <uGoMobi> keeps you busy
[05:30:35] <arschmitz> lol yeah bit too much my snowblower broke last night lol
[05:30:44] <uGoMobi> yikes
[05:30:50] <uGoMobi> can't have that now
[05:30:57] <arschmitz> yeah thankfully right as i was finishing 
[05:31:08] <arschmitz> yeah ill get it fixed not a big deal hopefully
[05:31:34] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:34:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what do you think of http://jquerymobile.com/branches/range/docs/demos/sliders/sliders.html
[05:34:26] <uGoMobi> I really like it
[05:34:42] <uGoMobi> was great idea of toddmparker to change input styling
[05:34:52] <uGoMobi> makes a huge difference
[05:34:57] <arschmitz> it really does
[05:35:29] <uGoMobi> and it requires a lot less CSS which I like too :)
[05:35:32] <arschmitz> i really like that input style
[05:35:38] <arschmitz> and no wrapper
[05:35:47] <uGoMobi> yup
[05:35:59] <arschmitz> but yeah i really like that
[05:36:23] <uGoMobi> well, we will still wrap the slider and inputs together to clear the float
[05:36:26] <arschmitz> the inuts really look good
[05:36:34] <uGoMobi> but not another wrap around the slider itself
[05:36:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah but only one wrapper not two at least
[05:36:59] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:37:21] <uGoMobi> not sure if we need more margin between slider and inputs
[05:37:31] <arschmitz> i was just looking at that
[05:37:53] <arschmitz> and im not sure i dont think we "need" it but it might look a little nicer
[05:37:57] <uGoMobi> i didn't have a problem focussing handle or input on touch
[05:38:23] <arschmitz> yeah i dont think its a usability issue at all just if it might look better with a few more pixels lol
[05:38:36] <uGoMobi> yeah i see what you mean
[05:39:05] <arschmitz> just enough so the focus glow has a pixel or two between it and the input
[05:39:08] <uGoMobi> I thougt I just push this with minimal margin and ask your and toddmparker_ his opinion
[05:39:09] <arschmitz> right now they touch
[05:39:20] <uGoMobi> yes
[05:39:32] <arschmitz> but either way i really like it
[05:41:12] <uGoMobi> ok I agree they need little bit more margin... gonna change that now
[05:44:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: dont know if you saw this last night but i think im going to try putting it on one of my androids easy way to test webviews and we have a ton of issues about them that never get looked at because its such a pain
[05:44:37] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5163#issuecomment-11722328
[05:45:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nice
[05:45:36] <arschmitz> its a really good idea for testing i thought
[05:45:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: actually I was thinking the same about that everlasting phonegap transition blink issue
[05:46:51] <arschmitz> ill let you know how it works lol

[05:49:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool
[06:03:06] <arschmitz> that app is cool
[06:03:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i put it on my 2.3.7 device and tried the slide panels 
[06:04:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you see the issue right away?
[06:04:16] <arschmitz> nope dont see it at all actually they work perfect
[06:04:27] <arschmitz> but 2.3.7 doesnt get transitions
[06:04:55] <uGoMobi> aaha
[06:05:06] <uGoMobi> I have 4.1 device here
[06:05:13] <arschmitz> i have one too
[06:05:17] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:05:38] <arschmitz> i probably wont get to it for a bit on that one though so if you want to try the app out go for it lol
[06:06:49] <arschmitz> i think we are going to have to thank webslash for that app though i think its going to be really really usefull
[06:07:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they even took the time to make it look nice and designed it specificly for us uses the new logo and everything 
[06:07:40] <arschmitz> really well done
[06:08:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: very cool... def have to thank them
[06:08:43] <arschmitz> if they dont mind we should post it in the resources section it could be usefull for a lot of people i think
[06:47:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i need a suggestion for an event name. 
[06:47:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[06:47:41] <arschmitz> https://gist.github.com/f2d316b78cb2e60c39fb#file-rangeslide-js-L178
[06:47:49] <arschmitz> for the one johnbender suggests here
[06:48:31] <arschmitz> im thinking maybe normalized or something and put it here and in the if above too
[06:48:40] <arschmitz> have it fire anytime we normalize the values
[06:48:58] <arschmitz> once the normalization is complete
[06:51:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sliderstop event fires too soon?
[06:51:38] <arschmitz> yeah 
[06:51:48] <arschmitz> johnbender wanted it to account for the settimeout
[06:53:24] <arschmitz> so that a user can have something that is 100% after the change has completed
[06:54:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: because in that case change never fires because we return false so there is no way to know when it has happened for sure
[06:54:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this will also be good for testing
[06:54:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see
[06:55:41] <uGoMobi> hmm
[06:55:57] <arschmitz> we can change the value to something out of range and bind to this event to ensure that the value stays in range without needing a settimeout in the test
[06:57:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think this is the sort of thing that johnbender was talking about in the hangout the other day where even though its async still its a lot cleaner to test 
[06:57:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right
[06:57:41] <arschmitz> so now we just need a name
[06:57:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thinking if we do smething similar for other widget
[06:57:56] <uGoMobi> so we can be consistent in what name we use
[06:58:00] <arschmitz> and i can push all johnbenders changes 
[06:58:26] <arschmitz> hmm im not sure there is an equivilent action in slider
[06:58:51] <arschmitz> because you cant go out of range because the min and max set on the input
[06:59:08] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:59:35] <uGoMobi> I meant other widgets where we use an event to prevent using a setTimeout
[06:59:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh ok
[06:59:56] <uGoMobi> can't think of anything yet
[07:00:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah not sure off the top of my head
[07:00:27] <uGoMobi> well, we could always change later
[07:00:37] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:00:42] <uGoMobi> so just pick normalized for now
[07:00:47] <arschmitz> sounds goo
[07:00:49] <arschmitz> d
[07:00:51] <uGoMobi> ok

[07:05:05] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06range 14c2874c4 15Alexander Schmitz: Merge branch 'range' of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile into range
[07:10:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: something broken
[07:10:38] <arschmitz> just a sec ill look probably one of the changes i just made im sure 
[07:17:53] <arschmitz> i already had it open and just hit refreshed and had probably cached so i didnt see the failure
[07:22:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: intresting $.data cant take a jquery object for an element 
[07:23:03] <arschmitz> it has to be an actual dom element
[07:23:24] <uGoMobi> aha
[07:23:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: didnt realize that ... probably because im used to $.fn.data
[07:25:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: do you know if there is another method besides [0] prefered to get the node back out of the jquery object?
[07:26:02] <uGoMobi> hmm
[07:27:13] <arschmitz> there is get() but im pretty sure thats much slower
[07:27:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: with .get(0)
[07:27:50] <uGoMobi> haha
[07:27:58] <uGoMobi> right
[07:28:15] <uGoMobi> can't think of something else
[07:32:10] <arschmitz> wow im wrong .get(0) is 2% faster in chrome
[07:32:42] <arschmitz> its nor a big difference but enough
[07:40:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: all fixed

[07:40:15] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06range 14ed1c563 15Alexander Schmitz: rangeslider: fixed $.data calls to use dom node instead of jquery object
[07:40:15] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06range 1468dd8b5 15Alexander Schmitz: rangeslider: fixed typo in class name
[07:40:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[07:40:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe im crazy but the rangeslider feels a lot more responsive now lol
[07:41:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: probably wishfull thinking
[07:41:06] <uGoMobi> haha
[07:43:00] <arschmitz> though both slidedrag and updatehighlight had multiple calls to jquery.data and those are bothcalled on mousemove
[07:43:32] <arschmitz> so the 60+% increase could make a big difference there
[07:52:33] <RWhitbeck> Morning everyone…was there a meeting yesterday or did we ax it cause of the holidays?
[07:54:15] <uGoMobi> morning RWhitbeck 
[07:54:24] <uGoMobi> we didnt have a real meeting
[07:54:33] <uGoMobi> just informal update here on -dev
[07:54:46] <RWhitbeck> ok cool, thanks uGoMobi
[07:55:26] <uGoMobi> np
[07:56:22] <arschmitz> Morning RWhitbeck
[07:56:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I started on unit tests for rangeslider
[07:56:41] <RWhitbeck> hey arschmitz
[08:12:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so on galexy nexus with 4.1 i can reproduce the problem with panels
[08:12:18] <arschmitz> in the app from webslash
[08:54:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks like that tool is going to help us a lot... nice!
[08:54:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Yeah im pretty excited about it
[08:56:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I can reproduce that issue with rangeslider always selecting second handle when clicking on the track on Chrome too
[08:57:05] <arschmitz> what version i cant? what exact sequence of events?
[08:57:06] <uGoMobi> that was the problem Anne reported for Safari right?
[08:57:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[08:57:44] <uGoMobi> 23.0.1271.97 m
[08:58:15] <uGoMobi> just load the test page and click on the track near the left handle
[08:58:40] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15arschmitz pushed 1 new commit to 06range: 02http://git.io/TGU5ag
[08:58:40] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06range 14f96b3ff 15Alexander Schmitz: rangeslider: fixed typo in variable name
[08:59:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: clicking the highlight will always select the last focused handle if you have never focused one it will always pick the second
[08:59:44] <uGoMobi> aha
[08:59:57] <uGoMobi> I thought it picked the nearest one if no focus
[09:00:27] <uGoMobi> in that case it works as expected
[09:00:36] <arschmitz> this is because on small screens i didnt want to ever go with closest when clicking the highlight i thought it would be too funky on windows phone
[09:00:48] <arschmitz> since thouch isnt very accurate
[09:01:33] <arschmitz> or really not just windows phone but anytime handles were close together
[09:01:58] <uGoMobi> i can imagine
[09:02:31] <uGoMobi> well I can live with current behaviour
[09:02:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok
[09:03:04] <uGoMobi> not sure if Anne noticed different behaviour on safari
[09:08:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not sure
[09:08:50] <arschmitz> todd couldnt reproduce on safari and neither could i so im guessing there is a good chance its the same
[09:09:26] <uGoMobi> probably... we can check with her later
[09:10:33] <toddmparker_> hey guys
[09:10:47] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker_ 
[09:10:54] <arschmitz> hi toddmparker_
[09:12:20] <toddmparker_> sliders are lookin' sharp!
[09:12:39] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yeah, was good idea of you to style inputs differently
[09:12:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah that was a good idea 
[09:12:47] <uGoMobi> big difference
[09:12:57] <arschmitz> i love the look of the inputs now
[09:13:11] <uGoMobi> first I only wanted to get rid of the inputs and now I actually like them
[09:13:52] <toddmparker_> me too. glad that worked out
[09:13:58] <toddmparker_> you got the margins just right
[09:14:18] <toddmparker_> range is tight but workable at 320 imho
[09:15:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah its tight but workable. but easy to change with css if people dont agree
[09:15:38] <uGoMobi> true
[09:16:32] <toddmparker_> the inputs could almost be a tad narrower. they seem to fit 4-5 characters
[09:16:39] <toddmparker_> but i guess that's fine
[09:16:41] <uGoMobi> if you use high values like thousands you would probably need to adjust the inputs too
[09:17:18] <toddmparker_> i can squeeze in 5 digits
[09:17:28] <toddmparker_> i bet adjusting would be tricky, right?
[09:18:06] <uGoMobi> we can test a little bit more
[09:18:20] <uGoMobi> depends a bit on OS/browser
[09:18:27] <uGoMobi> font etc
[09:19:19] <toddmparker_> right. think it's good as is
[09:19:25] <uGoMobi> but it is easy to adjust with custom CSS
[09:19:49] <toddmparker_> do we have a demo with the inputs hidden accessibly and the slider full width?
[09:19:56] <toddmparker_> that would be a good one
[09:20:08] <toddmparker_> maybe with values tacked onto the label
[09:20:10] <uGoMobi> no not yet but I agree we have to add that
[09:20:17] <toddmparker_> Price: 100-250
[09:20:23] <uGoMobi> together with tooltip labels demo
[09:20:34] <toddmparker_> yeah
[09:20:43] <uGoMobi> the demo of _|Nix|_ 
[09:21:16] <uGoMobi> we can make one demo page showing all those possibilities
[09:25:58] <toddmparker_> cool
[09:26:04] <toddmparker_> i need to hop off, sorry
[09:26:16] <toddmparker_> zach may pop in, he's making good unit test progress
[09:26:33] <toddmparker_> oh, if you guys can help me debug teh panel stuff on android, i'd really appreciate it
[09:26:39] <toddmparker_> i'm not set up at all here
[09:26:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: sure, np
[09:27:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: ill try and take a look i have the app from webslash set up
[09:31:51] <toddmparker_> thanks guys. seriously.
[09:32:03] <toddmparker_> ok, i'll check in later!
[10:08:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: somehow it is possible on Android to move a handle of both a slider and rangeslider example at once :(
[10:08:19] <arschmitz> wait what?
[10:08:29] <uGoMobi> only one has visual focus styling
[10:08:54] <uGoMobi> but the handle of the other example moves in sync
[10:08:57] <arschmitz> you can move two completely seperate widgets at once
[10:09:02] <uGoMobi> yes
[10:09:11] <arschmitz> crazy
[10:09:19] <arschmitz> i need to check that out
[10:09:21] <uGoMobi> i have to see what is the exact sequence
[10:09:46] <uGoMobi> but I could reproduce it multiple times
[10:10:21] <uGoMobi> Android 4.1 BTW
[10:10:40] <arschmitz> ok
[10:11:12] <uGoMobi> ah this is what you need to do...
[10:11:38] <uGoMobi> slide a handle
[10:12:03] <uGoMobi> and then slide handle of other example but without tapping somewhere first
[10:12:15] <uGoMobi> so it doesn't blur
[10:13:13] <uGoMobi> at the moment i am testing it in that webview app but I also reproduced it in the browser
[10:15:50] <arschmitz> ok
[10:20:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont know about you but im seeing all sorts of slider problems on android
[10:20:16] <arschmitz> like you cant drag the handles
[10:20:29] <arschmitz> they will drage one step and thats it
[10:21:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what Android version?
[10:21:34] <uGoMobi> I can drag the sliders
[10:21:35] <arschmitz> 2.3.7 and 4.1 both
[10:21:49] <uGoMobi> it's just that they respond bit slow
[10:22:08] <arschmitz> no mine wont update untill i tap somewhere to blur them
[10:22:14] <arschmitz> on slider or range
[10:22:41] <uGoMobi> and it looks a bit like a two-step thing... first set focus, then drag
[10:22:50] <uGoMobi> both slider and rangeslider
[10:23:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I agree it's far from smooth
[10:24:18] <uGoMobi> and that's a slider issue in general, not rangeslider
[10:24:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: somthing is really wrong here its not like that on master
[10:24:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im going to have to look at this and see whats killing it
[10:25:05] <uGoMobi> flip toggle switch is buggy too
[10:26:39] <arschmitz> yeah gonna have to put the breaks on this for a moment and find this problem something is seriously wrong on android
[10:33:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if I compare the slider at docs/forms/slider/ on master and branch range there is less difference, but branch range is still less responsive
[10:35:53] <uGoMobi> not so sure anymore if i see a difference
[10:36:12] <uGoMobi> so it could be that the test page is a bit too heavy
[10:36:21] <arschmitz> let me try that i was comparing demo page to docs/forms/slider
[10:37:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think your right when i compare the same page in both its the same
[10:37:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think the demo page just has too much going on and its killing android
[10:38:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: think so too
[10:38:14] <arschmitz> that makes me feel a bit better 
[10:38:23] <arschmitz> i thought i had seriously broken slider lol
[10:38:43] <uGoMobi> 50 sliders on one page probably doesn't reflect real world use cases
[10:39:37] <arschmitz> the two moving in sync dosent happen on http://jquerymobile.com/branches/range/docs/forms/forms-all.html for me
[10:39:40] <arschmitz> can you try it
[10:39:42] <uGoMobi> I can split up that demo page now we are done with the styling
[10:40:08] <uGoMobi> sure I'll try
[10:40:14] <arschmitz> i think events are getting lost on the demo page because of it choking out android
[10:40:18] <arschmitz> which is whats causing that
[10:41:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so note for the docs dont put 50 sliders on one page or android will cry 
[10:42:02] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:42:37] <uGoMobi> can't reproduce it either on that page
[10:42:42] <arschmitz> ok cool
[10:42:59] <arschmitz> the demo page is fine on ios
[10:43:24] <arschmitz> but even a galexy nexus with 4.1 cant handle it 
[10:43:37] <arschmitz> thats pretty lame on the part of android
[10:43:51] <uGoMobi> yeah
[10:43:53] <arschmitz> i only have an iphone 4 with ios5 too
[10:44:00] <arschmitz> its no exactly new
[10:44:19] <arschmitz> the nexus is only like 2 months old
[10:44:52] <uGoMobi> i still don't have the 4.2 update for my nexus
[10:45:19] <uGoMobi> think i am going to install it manually... curious if there are improvements in the browser
[10:45:21] <arschmitz> i was playing with a 4.2 android the otherday my father has one
[10:45:35] <arschmitz> it seems a LOT better then 4.1
[10:45:55] <arschmitz> He said he thought it was a huge improvment too
[10:46:03] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[10:46:57] <arschmitz> i wonder what in slider makes it choke on android like that thoug
[10:47:51] <arschmitz> _create and refresh in slider are so massive though it rough
[10:48:09] <arschmitz> to really try and identify a cause
[10:48:11] <uGoMobi> yeah refresh for sure
[10:48:32] <arschmitz> i feel like refresh should really be like 8 different methods lol
[10:48:43] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:48:45] <uGoMobi> pfff
[10:48:57] <uGoMobi> lot going on in there
[10:49:04] <arschmitz> there is for sure
[10:50:19] <arschmitz> iv been putting a lot of thought in (though no effort aside from that so far) on breaking toolbars popups and panels out of pages
[10:50:25] <arschmitz> and how exactly that would work
[10:51:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i know that was totally off topic lol
[10:51:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: haha
[10:51:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I had to read twice indeed
[10:51:53] <uGoMobi> to find out there was no "slider" in there
[10:51:54] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:53:08] <uGoMobi> i need inspiration for rangeslider unit tests
[10:53:55] <arschmitz> what do you have so far?
[10:54:21] <uGoMobi> nothing much... only the basics
[10:54:31] <uGoMobi> now I have to put the actual tests in there
[10:55:13] <arschmitz> ok we will want to make sure that after a change the highlight has the right position
[10:55:21] <arschmitz> leftmargin / width
[10:55:37] <arschmitz> we want to make sure min cant be greater then max
[10:56:15] <uGoMobi> ok lets start with those two
[10:56:17] <arschmitz> want to make sure that clicking the extreams updates the correct handle
[10:56:31] <arschmitz> want to make sure clicking the highlight updates the right handle 
[10:56:49] <uGoMobi> not sure how i can test clicking the extreams
[10:57:05] <uGoMobi> how can I tell the test where I click
[10:57:07] <arschmitz> will have to make a fake event object
[10:57:24] <arschmitz> that has the x and y cords
[10:57:29] <uGoMobi> aha
[10:58:31] <arschmitz> im heading to lunch in a min but i can help with those when i get back
[10:58:42] <uGoMobi> i take a break too
[10:58:51] <uGoMobi> talk to you later
[10:58:56] <arschmitz> sounds good 
[10:58:57] <arschmitz> later
[10:58:59] <uGoMobi> enjoy lunch
[12:50:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im back
[12:51:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker_: i found an issue on slide panels 
[12:51:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: welcome back
[12:54:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker_: if you set dismissable to false it throws an error on every open or close its from this line https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/slide-panel-refactor/js/widgets/panel.js#L232  you are adding and removing a class from _modal which is undefined if dismissible is set to false
[12:57:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker_: this should be wrapped in if(typeof self._modal !== "undefined"){} or something to that effect
[12:58:23] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker_: you can see this issue at http://jsbin.com/uzaret/613
[13:00:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker_: also not sure if this really matters but i noticed a few places where panel uses .on instead of ._on. Also noticed the use of self (ie self = this) not that this is a problem but not really needed most of the places since _on preserves the refrence to this 
[13:01:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sorry wanted to get that all down before i forgot
[13:01:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: np at all
[13:01:36] <uGoMobi> good catch
[13:02:04] <arschmitz> dont think it has anything to do with the webview issue but yeah 
[13:03:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker_: also if you switch to _on you wont need all the .off in destroy
[14:41:01] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker_: the if above should be if(self._modal !== null)
[14:43:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker_: also noticed if you call close on a closed panel then open it it opens then squashes the panel to the left because its not removing the class ui-panel-closed gets added at end of open for some reason
[14:47:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker_: it looks like this is because you are running the transition on the closed panel which dosent complete so it dosent call complete. I wouldnt think close should do anything on a closed panel. maybe the whole method should be wrapped in if(this._open) and not do anything if its not open
[14:50:39] <arschmitz> toddmparker: toddmparker_: if you have any questions about this stuff or want me to make any of these changes let me know. im heading home for the day but will keep checking in.
