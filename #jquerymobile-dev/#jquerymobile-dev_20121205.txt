[01:46:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[01:46:39] <uGoMobi> morning _|Nix|_ 
[01:46:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! How do I exclude a script from view source?
[01:46:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Making a redirect demo.
[01:47:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I actually never did that
[01:47:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have a popup that shows PHP source.
[01:47:36] <uGoMobi> I know it should be possible
[01:47:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: wait..
[01:47:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Don't really wanna show the code that grabs the PHP source.
[01:47:58] <uGoMobi> still early
[01:48:12] <uGoMobi> I misunderstood you
[01:48:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have div data-demo-js="true", and it's grabbing all the JS from the HEAD. I only want it to grab a certain tag.
[01:49:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that isn't possible yet
[01:49:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It'd be nice if I could go like data-demo-js="#myScriptTag" ...
[01:49:30] <uGoMobi> but def something I want to make possible
[01:49:48] <uGoMobi> I tried with a class on the script and style tags in the head
[01:49:58] <uGoMobi> that worked for style but not for script
[01:49:59] <_|Nix|_> ... and then <script id="myScriptTag" ...></script>
[01:50:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I didn't try with an id yet
[01:50:49] <uGoMobi> and I tried with jQuery, maybe it does work when using JavaScript
[01:51:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am working on demos today anyway so I will look into it
[01:59:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I got id-based script selection to work.
[01:59:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool!
[02:00:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think I used [data-demo-js="true"] in selectors
[02:00:13] <uGoMobi> we would have to change those
[02:00:22] <uGoMobi> or did you already do that?

[02:00:40] <_|Nix|_> Dammit! Forgot to update the commit message! I'm such an idiot *facepalm*
[02:01:03] <uGoMobi> lo
[02:01:04] <uGoMobi> l
[02:01:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I reduced it to [data-demo-js] and then I retrieve the ID separately, and add it to the selector afterwards.
[02:02:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this line needs to be updated too...
[02:02:11] <uGoMobi> $( this ).find( "[data-demo-html='true'], [data-demo-js='true'], [data-demo-css='true']" ).viewSourceCode();
[02:02:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oops ... weird, cuz it worked for me ...
[02:02:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 
[02:02:38] <uGoMobi> huh
[02:02:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe sizzle automatically reduces [something='true'] to [something]
[02:03:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But I agree - I'll update it.
[02:03:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: or because you have HTML demo too
[02:03:49] <uGoMobi> I think it won't work if you would only want to show JS source code
[02:03:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but great that this works now
[02:04:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: want to do the same for style

[02:08:06] <_|Nix|_> OK. Redirect demo is in place.
[02:08:21] <_|Nix|_> Hope it works. It requires a PHP, so that'll depend on the server too, I guess.
[02:08:32] <_|Nix|_> Now, to upgrade my box to F18 Beta - finally.
[02:08:45] <uGoMobi> :)
[02:10:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: another feature I want to add is the line highlighting
[02:10:52] <uGoMobi> that is already possible but I want to make it work with data- attribute on the demo as well as on the link to the popup
[02:11:25] <uGoMobi> so you can open the same popup with different links and specify a different line to highlight

[06:34:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pong!
[06:35:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Checkboxes are broken on iOS?
[06:35:06] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[06:35:12] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:35:25] <uGoMobi> but I was looking for you for something else
[06:35:30] <uGoMobi> minor thing...
[06:35:40] <_|Nix|_> Hmmmm ... I shall have to, well ... check when I get home ...
[06:35:50] <uGoMobi> I included PHP in demo source view code function
[06:35:52] <_|Nix|_> Is there an issue about it?
[06:36:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, cool! How did you do it? PHP has its own source view method.
[06:36:49] <uGoMobi> yeah, I used your code
[06:37:11] <uGoMobi> append the data to a div
[06:37:16] <uGoMobi> and then use text()
[06:37:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aaaah OK ... cool!
[06:38:00] <uGoMobi> the minor issue is that for some reason the php tags are replaced by <!--?php
[06:38:10] <uGoMobi> as if it's comment opening tag
[06:38:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So the PHP stills spits out its own code with view-source() ... cool ...
[06:38:25] <uGoMobi> probably a bug in syntaxhighlighter
[06:38:41] <uGoMobi> yeah it gets its own collapsible
[06:38:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Might be.
[06:38:55] <uGoMobi> since you are good with regex stuff
[06:39:03] <uGoMobi> maybe you can give that a look some time
[06:39:17] <uGoMobi> not really a blocker, but looks weird
[06:39:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe because the PHP source code is already highlighted when it is produced by the PHP ...
[06:39:36] <uGoMobi> i tried to replace it but didn't wor
[06:39:39] <uGoMobi> work*
[06:39:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll have a look ...
[06:39:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, but I worked around that by using text()
[06:40:13] <uGoMobi> I will look at checkbox now
[06:41:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'm backing up my laptop ... next step is to put F18 beta on it. 
[06:41:36] <uGoMobi> F18? Fedora?
[06:41:41] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[06:41:45] <uGoMobi> ok nice
[06:42:03] <_|Nix|_> Can't wait for final. I want my GNOME2 back, pronto!
[06:43:01] <uGoMobi> haha
[06:47:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i just closed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5346 i looked at sammy and it tracks and modifies the hash
[06:48:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, thanks
[06:48:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah saw your comment after i commented
[06:49:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah we had that before and probably won't be the last time :D
[06:49:45] <arschmitz> im sure lol
[06:50:10] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|: uGoMobi: by the way lol
[06:50:27] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz :)
[06:51:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the issue with the checkbox is a regression from your last commit to checkboxradio.js
[06:51:59] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/c8dcf58eebb55318dbc5f5bbc71bfed4d906218e

[06:58:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeahhh!
[06:59:41] <uGoMobi> in may/june we were close to 600 open issues
[06:59:48] <uGoMobi> how's that for progress
[07:04:43] <arschmitz> thats awesome
[07:07:17] <arschmitz> ~360 closed issues in the last two months
[07:07:23] <arschmitz> CLOSED!
[07:09:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, I'll check it out when I get home (approx 22:00 your time)
[07:09:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[07:10:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: my PHP source view doesn't work on the server, only local :(
[07:11:07] <_|Nix|_> Gotta go now.
[07:11:44] <uGoMobi> later _|Nix|_ 
[07:58:43] <toddmparker> arschmitz and uGoMobi - great job on issues
[07:59:03] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: thanks
[07:59:13] <toddmparker> you've been steadily grinding that list down which is hard with all the new ones coming in
[07:59:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the checkox issue is regression from last commit from _|Nix|_ , he will look into it later today
[07:59:40] <toddmparker> funny i caught that checkbox issue, i was just randomly testing on the way in and thought i was losing my mind
[07:59:59] <toddmparker> when is 22:00 in that part of the world?
[08:00:07] <arschmitz> thanks toddmparker
[08:00:19] <uGoMobi> in 5 hours it's 22:00 for me
[08:00:27] <uGoMobi> 23:00 for _|Nix|_ 
[08:00:55] <toddmparker> ah, ok. all this metric time stuff and timezones.
[08:01:04] <toddmparker> you're all mixed up
[08:01:15] <toddmparker> EST or buts.
[08:01:33] <toddmparker> so jlembeck and Wilto are doing some hardcore re-factoring this morning on panels
[08:07:36] <toddmparker> for the push panel where we want both the panel and content to be clickable (not dismissed) at wider widths, we decided to just display:none the dismiss overlay within a media query.
[08:08:39] <toddmparker> just a good tip if you need to do things like that. try to use css in a MQ instead of surfacing a JS option. we were toying with adding js logic and an option for the width where this would happen. css is way simpler.

[08:34:59] <_|Nix|_> Man ... that last efforty killed bot-t!
[08:37:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: view_source() may not be available in the strict version of PHP ...
[08:39:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what I found strange is that when you open http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/redirect/redirect.php?source in the browser you do get to view the PHP source code
[08:39:30] <uGoMobi> but it looks like you can't grab it with Ajax
[08:40:02] <uGoMobi> but Ajax also doesn't return an error
[08:42:38] <toddmparker> interesting.
[08:42:52] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: military, metric, whatever. it's wrong.
[08:43:52] <uGoMobi> let's switch to unix time
[08:50:43] <toddmparker> ha. agreed uGoMobi

[09:24:33] <johnbender> I'm seeing mobilePage insteado of just page in the data
[09:24:59] <johnbender> `mobilePage` `page`
[09:25:48] <uGoMobi> johnbender: that's about the errors in jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build right
[09:25:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: no
[09:25:57] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[09:25:59] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm running into it on my merge
[09:26:01] <johnbender> arg
[09:26:05] <johnbender> are there failures in the test suite right now
[09:26:08] <johnbender> I have bad timing
[09:26:41] <uGoMobi> I don't know about any changes in mobilePage
[09:27:45] <johnbender> hmm
[09:27:48] <johnbender> this is annoying
[09:28:01] <uGoMobi> johnbender: the errors I saw in the jQuery Git build were about active page BTW
[09:28:11] <johnbender> yah I looked
[09:28:15] <johnbender> they might be related but I'm not sure
[09:28:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you know anything about this ^^
[09:28:28] <johnbender> doubtful given that the master build is fine
[09:28:47] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[09:28:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no im not aware of any changes either.
[09:31:21] <arschmitz> the only changes in the last 4 months to page.js is _|Nix|_ switched to _on for attaching handlers

[09:31:45] <uGoMobi> I think that commit from _|Nix|_ might have caused this
[09:32:17] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ah
[09:32:22] <johnbender> I think he just missed one then
[09:32:37] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'll handle it
[09:32:44] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok
[09:35:12] <johnbender> Hold on to your buts
[09:36:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and arschmitz - I think we have a regression somewhere not he iOS url bar hiding
[09:36:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I remember an issue about the address bar only being half hidden
[09:36:47] <toddmparker> try this: open docs on master, click on a page. URL bar will show briefly, then hide
[09:36:56] <toddmparker> looks good
[09:37:14] <toddmparker> refresh any inner page and the url bar will hang for 7-10 seconds
[09:37:16] <toddmparker> then hide
[09:37:30] <toddmparker> this might be something johnbender or _|Nix|_ 
[09:37:35] <toddmparker> would know about too
[09:37:38] <toddmparker> looks bad
[09:37:39] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5202
[09:38:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker i dont see this on iphone 4 ios 5
[09:38:17] <toddmparker> no?
[09:38:27] <uGoMobi> but that test page uses an old version of JQM
[09:39:31] <johnbender> toddmparker: if there's no fiddle I don't see how we can reproduce it
[09:39:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker no the url bar behivor is exactly the same durring navigation before and after a refresh on any page i tried
[09:41:28] <toddmparker> johnbender: it's on http://jquerymobile.com/test
[09:41:35] <toddmparker> on an iPhone 5
[09:42:09] <johnbender> toddmparker: you can repro?
[09:42:16] <johnbender> wooooweeee! good luck
[09:42:21] <johnbender> that one sounds ugly
[09:42:48] <johnbender> I don't want to count my chickens here but the only failing test I'm seeing is in popup
[09:42:51] <johnbender> and that one is just stuck
[09:43:02] <johnbender> this could be over quickly
[09:43:17] <toddmparker> johnbender: great
[09:43:28] <toddmparker> arschmitz: I can repro on an iPhone 4 running 5
[09:43:34] <toddmparker> it's not as bad, but it's there
[09:43:43] <arschmitz> weird i dont see it at all
[09:43:53] <toddmparker> ok, start on the homepage of docs
[09:44:01] <johnbender> lolol nevermind
[09:44:03] <johnbender> sequence tests
[09:44:04] <toddmparker> click on the Intro link
[09:44:18] <toddmparker> the url bar should drop, then hide BEFORE the transition
[09:44:25] <arschmitz> yup
[09:44:51] <toddmparker> which is how it should be
[09:45:20] <toddmparker> once you refresh on an inner page, the url bar will be there through transition and well after
[09:46:19] <arschmitz> its the intro page
[09:46:25] <toddmparker> Home > Intro > Features = smooth
[09:46:25] <arschmitz> the pages and dialogs page dosent do it
[09:46:38] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ the sequence tests are passing but they are timing out after the merge
[09:46:39] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[09:46:46] <toddmparker> Home > Intro > (refresh) > Features = bad
[09:46:53] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ some failures but mostly just totall timeouts
[09:46:54] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[09:47:06] <toddmparker> are we doing something different on the homepage?
[09:47:11] <toddmparker> uGoMobi ^^
[09:47:20] <arschmitz> home > intro > pages and dialogs > refresh > all is good
[09:47:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: there is no div with data-role="header" I think
[09:48:35] <arschmitz> toddmparker i think its more about the intro page then the home page
[09:48:36] <toddmparker> hmm
[09:49:11] <uGoMobi> what is homepage and what is intro page?
[09:49:25] <arschmitz> homepage = jquerymobile.com/test
[09:49:28] <toddmparker> intro = first link. Intro to jQM
[09:49:48] <uGoMobi> ah ok, I get it
[09:49:50] <toddmparker> features = first link on the intro page
[09:50:31] <uGoMobi> do you see the same issue on the 1.2.0 docs?
[09:51:11] <toddmparker> lemme check
[09:52:00] <toddmparker> yep. problem in 1.2 too
[09:52:10] <uGoMobi> intro page seems to have some issues http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fjquerymobile.com%2Ftest%2Fdocs%2Fabout%2Fintro.html&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[09:52:16] <toddmparker> just worse on iOS6 + iPhone5
[09:52:28] <toddmparker> i can repro on any inner page
[09:52:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker: intro quickstart features and supported platfroms all do this
[09:52:46] <arschmitz> pages and dialogs and accessibility doesnt checking others
[09:53:17] <uGoMobi> checking markup of the intro, etc. pages
[09:54:01] <toddmparker> hmmm, maybe I was mistaken
[09:54:16] <toddmparker> now I can't repro in the button pages where i was seeing it
[09:54:43] <arschmitz> i can only repro in intro to jQuery Mobile, Quick start guide, features, and supported platforms
[09:54:51] <toddmparker> huh. ok
[09:54:59] <arschmitz> everything else seems fine
[09:55:18] <toddmparker> i was seeing this on the panel page…that's what got me started
[09:55:27] <toddmparker> wonder what's different?
[09:56:05] <arschmitz> toddmparker: just a guess but i bet those are the pages that its been the longest since they were updated?
[09:57:48] <toddmparker> ya
[09:58:55] <toddmparker> tho panels page is slow too
[10:01:24] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ looks like the popup failures are just navigate binding timeouts hopefully that will be quick
[10:01:24] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.

[10:03:01] <toddmparker> i know arschmitz

[10:17:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker: FIGURED IT OUT!
[10:17:33] <toddmparker> arschmitz: no way
[10:17:41] <arschmitz> yup but i dont think we can fix it
[10:17:46] <arschmitz> its the safari reader
[10:17:52] <toddmparker> no way
[10:18:07] <toddmparker> if reader thinks it can parse the page, it takes the time
[10:18:08] <arschmitz> if you initally load a page that the reader works on hiding is crap
[10:18:22] <arschmitz> it you load a page that reader wont work on all is good
[10:19:04] <arschmitz> toddmparker: and i always actually liked the reader feature :(
[10:19:12] <toddmparker> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2997918/how-to-enable-ios-5-safari-reader-on-my-website
[10:19:18] <toddmparker> yeah, seems like a black box
[10:20:13] <arschmitz> yeah iv done a bunch of research on it before its  a complex algorithem that involves amount of text their relative placment if they have a wrapper element blah blah blah blah
[10:20:32] <toddmparker> http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/safari-reader
[10:21:30] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah iv read that before. so i think we are out of luck for a fix on this unless we want to rewrite the docs to trick it lol
[10:22:23] <toddmparker> aw, man
[10:22:27] <toddmparker> at least we know why
[10:23:35] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i was about to give up too it was so weird and random
[10:25:34] <uGoMobi> Q about Github: I get a lot more notifications in my mailbox than on the website since a couple of weeks. Am I the only one?
[10:27:30] <toddmparker> i've had about the same
[10:28:00] <uGoMobi> strange
[10:28:16] <uGoMobi> will see if it has been reported
[10:28:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5202 shall we close that one again?
[10:29:07] <arschmitz> +1 reclose
[10:29:17] <uGoMobi> I don't think that issue had to do with Safari Reader, nothing much to read on his page  http://m.addisonlee.com
[10:29:42] <uGoMobi> I just think it's an issue with his header image
[10:29:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:i dont think so either i say close for that reason
[10:30:12] <toddmparker> i re-closed
[10:30:18] <arschmitz> that i thnk its the image and they still havent given a real test case
[10:30:30] <toddmparker> shouldn't have re-opened that one anyway, my bad
[10:31:00] <arschmitz> yeah toddmparker: you put as back at 280 what were you thinking!!!

[10:53:55] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: that transition change is still in a branch, right?
[10:54:03] <toddmparker> totally random arschmitz 
[10:54:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes
[10:54:22] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I think we only need to test on a few more older devices

[10:54:52] <toddmparker> right
[10:54:53] <uGoMobi> but it looks solid to me
[10:54:58] <toddmparker> then you can land it
[10:55:03] <toddmparker> yeah, should be
[11:03:28] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ ping me when you get a chance, we need to either remove all of the navigate event cascade bindings or find something else to bind to, right now removing them appears to work just fine but I know you had them in there to make sure the state of the page was sane

[11:40:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi - re:5317, that's why I didn't spend a lot of time getting these new widgets into the old format
[11:40:19] <toddmparker> i was thinking we could pull it in anyway, why not.
[11:40:20] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I understand
[11:40:42] <toddmparker> i just didn't get a chance to review…if it seems ok, you can green button it
[11:40:51] <toddmparker> might be good to make him happy
[11:42:54] <toddmparker> arschmitz: i closed one for ya
[11:43:10] <arschmitz> :)
[11:43:29] <arschmitz> Was it chosen at random?
[11:49:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: were you planning on making changes to swipe for 1.4?
[11:49:24] <uGoMobi> was looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5311
[11:50:11] <uGoMobi> wasn't sure anymore if this is something we were going to change or just document as know limitation
[12:02:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it will be in 1.3 this is a wont fix i think because i dont think this is a limitation i think this is the correct behivor i think swipe by its nature should be fired on cords not an element
[12:02:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok thanks
[12:02:52] <uGoMobi> yeah I agree... limitation is not the correct word

[12:03:19] <uGoMobi> I will add the note later so we can close that one

[12:25:34] <toddmparker> you guys are on a tear today
[12:25:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the new swipe event is merged
[12:26:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I noticed... nice!
[12:27:00] <arschmitz> as for documentation for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5311 i think all we need is a note that this is fired on a set of cords not an element
[12:27:43] <arschmitz> and in general we need to document that it can now be extended and how
[12:27:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, I am looking at the events page in the docs
[12:27:53] <uGoMobi> to see how/where to add this
[12:28:29] <toddmparker> might as well just add this to the api docs. not too worried about the old docs
[12:28:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I leave that part (how it can extended) to you if you don't mind
[12:28:45] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: good point
[12:28:47] <arschmitz> yeah no problem i need to make a demo to using the extension to fix on ios
[12:29:50] <arschmitz> oh that needs to be documented too that swipe left / right is broken on ios
[12:30:05] <uGoMobi> is it?
[12:30:21] <arschmitz> well scrolling up and down trigers swipe left / right
[12:30:31] <arschmitz> so i think thats pretty broken
[12:30:35] <uGoMobi> ah that issue
[12:30:39] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:30:43] <uGoMobi> sounds broken to me
[12:30:46] <uGoMobi> too
[12:31:08] <arschmitz> it just got closed when i merged the new event 
[12:31:15] <arschmitz> so i should probably comment on that lol
[12:31:23] <uGoMobi> but swipe left/right still trigger the swipe event as well?
[12:31:31] <arschmitz> yes
[12:31:45] <arschmitz> they are triggered when they should be
[12:31:49] <toddmparker> we're going to be using swipe left/right to close panels
[12:32:01] <toddmparker> so i'll be all fired up to make sure that works well
[12:32:10] <arschmitz> but verticalDistanceThreshold is not respected
[12:32:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: now I remember I created a test age for that
[12:32:25] <arschmitz> yup
[12:32:32] <uGoMobi> should be posted in a comment
[12:32:43] <arschmitz> yes and a link to the extension that fixes it
[12:33:03] <arschmitz> https://github.com/arschmitz/JQM-Swipefix/blob/master/swipefix.js
[12:34:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: now I am confused... is swipe left/right still broken on iOS or did you just land a fix for that?
[12:34:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its still broken
[12:34:51] <arschmitz> we decided wont fix because the fix has performance implications
[12:35:00] <arschmitz> but there is a fix if people dont care
[12:35:04] <uGoMobi> but the issue is closed by a commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2328
[12:35:26] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:35:31] <arschmitz> yes because it makes it possible for people to extend the event to fix it
[12:35:42] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[12:36:58] <arschmitz> so just need to document and comment so people know
[12:37:05] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:38:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you include a note that explains swipe is triggered on cords?
[12:38:24] <arschmitz> in the docs you mean?
[12:38:37] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:38:42] <arschmitz> yeah no problem
[12:39:02] <uGoMobi> I have a swipe demo page in my repo
[12:39:15] <uGoMobi> I can copy that to our demos
[12:40:25] <uGoMobi> so people see you have to use $(document).on("swipeleft", "selector", function(){...
[12:40:41] <arschmitz> sounds good
[12:41:22] <uGoMobi> if we want we can even add some text there later to explain it, but would be good to have this info in the new API docs too
[12:54:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What exactly is the checkbox regression? I'm getting there with my F18 install ...

[12:55:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: checkboxes don't respond anymore
[12:56:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: only if you wrap the checkbox with the label
[12:56:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Where can I test that?
[12:56:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Docs?
[12:56:23] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:56:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/checkboxes/
[12:57:05] <uGoMobi> only the first example works because that one is wrapped in a label
[12:57:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I bet it's the removal of the return false thing.
[12:57:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes it is
[12:57:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yaaaay!
[12:57:57] <uGoMobi> if you put that back it works again
[13:03:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i was just putting some more thought in on and taking another look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5311 and im not buying my explination any more lol
[13:03:31] <arschmitz> so im going to hold off on documenting this untill i look into it more
[13:03:36] <uGoMobi> there is no way back arschmitz 
[13:03:44] <uGoMobi> ;)
[13:03:58] <uGoMobi> ok sounds good
[13:04:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll get tracing.
[13:04:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: assigned it to you
[13:04:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds goo
[13:12:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Ping!
[13:32:50] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i think we could drop to 1.3
[13:32:59] <toddmparker> actually in there now, adding an icon for panels
[13:33:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok let's change that
[13:34:08] <uGoMobi> you could say everything with a ratio bigger than 1 should get the HD sprite
[13:34:18] <uGoMobi> better to shrink than blow up
[13:34:24] <uGoMobi> but 1.3 seems fine
[13:42:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ping
[13:44:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hey! So, exactly what do we need to remove from where?
[13:44:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Do you mean we should no longer expect navigate events?
[13:45:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: In the detailedEventCascade calls?
[14:03:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You don't have to go as far as iOS for the broken checkboxes ... it's happening in Chrome as well.
[14:04:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes I know
[14:04:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I got a fix that makes it work every time except the first time - yaaaay!
[14:04:15] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:04:33] <uGoMobi> that's why it was easy to test if reverting your last change would fix it
[14:05:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but I'd like to keep the change. It's just that now that there're events coming from where before they were being eaten, we need to make sure we ignore those. So, I'm calling preventDefault() and checking isDefaultPrevented() ...
[14:05:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Works OK, except the first time :)

[14:18:12] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06slide-panel 142049baf 15Todd Parker: Icons: Added new bars (nav) and edit icons
[14:18:23] <toddmparker> I just created a new 3 bar icon for nav panels and an edit (pencil) icon
[14:18:48] <toddmparker> i added them to the panel branch so I can play with them and make sure I don't do anything horribly wrong
[14:19:03] <toddmparker> can't wait to switch to svg in 1.4
[14:21:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Wow! That'd be cool.
[14:21:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm sick and tired of png ...
[14:22:37] <toddmparker> yep
[14:22:55] <toddmparker> wasn't there an issue for the bar icon?
[14:24:13] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yup...ticket is created by and assigned to you
[14:25:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5340
[14:26:14] <toddmparker> thanks
[14:27:22] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I just made a change to switch to 1.3 and 200dpi to hopefully address lower slightly lower resolution screens while I was adding some new icons. 
[14:27:29] <toddmparker> closed: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5165
[14:27:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: because we use navigation _after_ clicks we can't fire the event
[14:27:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well more importantly the navigate event is a totally different thing now
[14:28:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: great!
[14:28:01] <_|Nix|_> BTW, just wanted to let everyone know that I've got a four day weekend coming up starting tomorrow (Thu). I'll try to fix the checkbox thing during that time. I have a fix even now, but some of the unit tests are failing, so I'll have to see about that.
[14:28:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. The expectation for navigate is there only to replace hashchange, which was unreliable.
[14:28:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: enjoy your long weekend!
[14:28:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[14:29:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I just wanna make sure to capture all the events so as not to test things prematurely.
[14:29:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah, I'll monkey around a bit and figure it out
[14:29:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I will add both tickets that you just closed to the 1.3 release notes wiki page
[14:30:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, if, as you say, navigate is a totally different thing now, and if removing the navigate from the list of expectations improves things, then by all means, yank the suckers.
[14:30:18] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: they are in there for a reason though, there are some failures from premature testing
[14:30:23] <johnbender> I'll see what I can do
[14:31:17] <arschmitz> I hate jsfiddle
[14:31:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, that's why they're in there - popups do not get the benefit of pagechange events, so you need to rely on substitutes.
[14:31:33] <uGoMobi> then don't use it arschmitz 
[14:31:34] <uGoMobi> :D
[14:31:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: +1 ( or should I say -1 ?)
[14:31:50] <arschmitz> lol it was posted in an issue
[14:31:58] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[14:32:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The first thing I do is to move the demo over to jsbin.
[14:32:07] <arschmitz> i just spent a solid hour and a half pulling my hair out finaly put into jsbin and it was fine
[14:32:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[14:32:15] <uGoMobi> first thing i do when that happens is copying code into a JS Bin
[14:32:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I start with your last step.
[14:32:31] <arschmitz> apparently i need to also
[14:32:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think arschmitz will do that too in the future ;)
[14:32:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Absolutely. jsfiddle needs to go the way of the dodo.

[15:13:23] <uGoMobi> looks like something is wrong with out persistent fixed toolbars http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/footer-persist-a.html
[15:14:12] <uGoMobi> if you navigate between pages and then click the home button in the header you see fixed toolbars on the homepage :(
[15:14:44] <uGoMobi> also noted multiple nav buttons in the footer getting the active state
[15:15:26] <uGoMobi> and page loading errors
[15:16:56] <uGoMobi> johnbender: could this have to that with that mobilePage data object? ^^
[15:17:15] <uGoMobi> s/have to/have to do/
[15:21:24] <johnbender> I have no idea
[15:21:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: but it might
[15:21:49] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I didn't push my fix
[15:21:58] <toddmparker> ok, i need to head out. talk to you tomorrow!
[15:22:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: did you look to see if there was an error in console?
[15:22:06] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I will look into it tomorrow
[15:22:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: good night!
[15:22:31] <toddmparker> panels are looking good (in chrome) - http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel/docs/panels/index.html
[15:22:45] <toddmparker> just need to refine so it less blink on iOS and Android
[15:23:24] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I just did

[15:35:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker jlembeck Wilto : panel looks really great guys!!
[15:50:49] <Fallout2man> How do I find where a hashchange event is being triggered from?
[15:51:17] <Fallout2man> I've got a "Menu" feature in my App that lets the user navigate to different portions of a multi-page template. Clicking to navigate works fine but when you close the menu something keeps basically hitting the back button and returning the user to where they started.
[15:51:38] <Fallout2man> All I can find out is that it's being done via a hash change, but not where that hash change was originated.
[15:55:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: It's only when the page is loaded directly or refreshed I'll look at it in a little while
[15:58:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:  this is weird I reproduced twice and now I can't again
