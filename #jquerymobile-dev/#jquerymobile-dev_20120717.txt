[02:05:05] <_|Nix|_> OK ... so move that option to the link, he says ... fine ...
[02:05:06] <bot-t> (34 hours 10 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell _|Nix|_ (when he is awake)... Gabriel, shouldn't we do a recalculation on resize / orientation change for the popup position?

[03:32:38] <_|Nix|_> This sucks! In Android 2.3.5 $( window ).height() gives the height of the document, not the height of the window :(
[03:32:50] <_|Nix|_> So I can't really center in the window.
[03:42:54] <_|Nix|_> Well, this sorta casts a shadow on the whole data-position-to thing :(
[03:43:50] <_|Nix|_> We'll have to document that it doesn't work on Android 2.3.5 :(
[03:44:43] <_|Nix|_> ?tell toddparker data-position-to="window" doesn't really work on Android 2.3.5, because $( window ).width() and $( window ).height() return the size of the document, not the size of the portion visible on screen.
[03:45:04] <_|Nix|_> Bah! bot-t is gone!
[03:45:13] <_|Nix|_> Nothing works!
[05:06:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe if we use something else than height() we can get the right value on Android 2.3: http://tripleodeon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/table.html
[05:07:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: availWidth() maybe
[05:08:49] <uGoMobi> availHeight() I mean

[08:26:24] <toddparker> morning all
[08:26:34] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i'm here
[08:26:53] <uGoMobi> hi Todd
[08:27:20] <uGoMobi> yeah, nevermind... I wanted to ask if you were already making changes to popup page
[08:27:31] <uGoMobi> moving the links
[08:28:44] <toddparker_> Finally got my phone on irc
[08:28:51] <toddparker_> Cool
[08:29:01] <uGoMobi> hehe... I never tried actually
[08:29:02] <toddparker_> I can stay in touch better now
[08:29:12] <uGoMobi> IRCCloud doesn't work for me today
[08:29:14] <uGoMobi> :(
[08:29:18] <toddparker_> I use colloquy on ios
[08:29:23] <toddparker_> Bummer
[08:29:33] <toddparker_> Wish there was an iOS app for that
[08:32:31] <uGoMobi> ttoddparker_: what are the things we need/want to do before 1.2alpha?
[08:33:20] <uGoMobi> popup has that Android issue with positioning, but then it is ready for alpha right?
[08:34:29] <uGoMobi> I will try to get the non-inset collapsibles in this week
[08:38:37] <wp-developer> hi
[08:47:46] <toddparker_> Both would be good to get in
[08:48:01] <toddparker_> I'd rather have this right before alpha
[08:48:13] <toddparker_> Always harder to make changes then
[09:16:39] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I get an invite for a hangout?
[09:17:33] <uGoMobi> guess you have to reorganize your G+ circles :)
[09:39:57] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi, Sorry I messed up my comment (had to rush or was going to miss my train... then couldn't edit on the train...) so I think ok for data-attribute, but we leave options that are not purely in the widget outside of the widget option page. The description goes to the widget page (but not the option page).
[09:40:03] <agcolom> Hi everyone :-)
[09:40:20] <agcolom> Just going to pick up my son from school now... back in 20 mins.
[09:43:02] <toddparker_> Ok agcolom
[09:43:15] <toddparker_> I need to respond to your comment on docs
[09:43:38] <agcolom> sure... back in 20mins
[10:03:01] <johnbender> toddparker: is it accurate to call image based rounded corners strictly _not_ PE?
[10:03:35] <johnbender> toddparker: better question - aside from nojs what is another really common example of the PE approach
[10:03:53] <johnbender> i'm adding a small "pe approach" section into my presentation
[10:03:58] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[10:12:36] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm just going to use the history api example since that's the one I'm most familiar with
[10:31:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: did you make any progress on that query param issue, my slides for OSCON are in good shape so I thought I would take the reins
[11:29:02] <toddparker> hi johnbender
[11:29:45] <toddparker> rounded corners is a bit more like graceful degradation - you add it but if it's not supported it's ok
[11:30:14] <toddparker> when you say noes - do you mean no script tags?
[11:30:37] <toddparker> classic PE would be a text area with that turns into a WYSIWYG editor
[11:30:55] <toddparker> or an input being transformed into a slider or datepicker
[11:31:15] <toddparker> of some anchor links becoming tabs or accordions or tooltips
[11:31:38] <toddparker> start with html only, layer in CSS and JS only for capable browsers
[11:31:45] <toddparker> that builds the enhanced experience
[11:32:18] <toddparker> we also do a lot to configure the enhanced widget via the markup - min/max/step config the slider etc
[11:32:29] <toddparker> noscript is GD
[11:33:12] <toddparker> so uGoMobi and agcolom - you need me?
[11:37:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I believe the issue is fixed in both master and 1.1-stable.
[11:38:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: decoding the URL on both sides of the comparison fixed it, AFAICT.
[11:39:42] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, what do we do about centering in Android 2.3.5? The problem is that window size = document size, so I can't really get the width/height of the actual window. I can, however, get the scroll(Left|Top) ...
[11:39:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... in directHashChange, I mean.
[11:47:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nice, do you have the commit
[11:47:55] <johnbender> I'm still concerned about what decoding means in terms of url with query params as a query param
[11:48:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: 946d623427fa79e51fcb13122df6a68758674a2a
[11:48:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks
[11:49:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nice
[11:49:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, we're comparing the incoming hash with the stuff we've stored inside urlHistory. So, we're basically avoiding the case where the stored value is encoded, and the incoming value is not.
[11:49:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: kk
[11:49:32] <johnbender> going to go test!
[11:49:36] * johnbender prays
[11:49:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it was odd that it was only in firefox though :/
[11:49:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Please! And please turn it into a unit test as well, if possible.
[11:50:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I've noticed that FF modifies the URL on-the-fly.
[11:50:30] <johnbender> yah
[11:50:34] <johnbender> that's what I was seeing as well
[11:50:47] <johnbender> it seemed inconsistent with timing
[11:50:57] <johnbender> the test swarm build is running
[11:51:04] <johnbender> (slowest/worst way to test)
[11:51:10] <johnbender> lets see what happens!
[11:51:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: woot popup succeeded!
[11:51:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The encoded URL doesn't even show up in my awesome bar :(
[11:51:52] <johnbender> MY KINGDOM FOR PASSING TESTS
[11:52:13] <johnbender> gar
[11:52:16] <johnbender> one failure in listview
[11:52:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I remember there was a combination of problems.
[11:52:20] <johnbender> but I don't think that was related
[11:52:23] <johnbender> iirc
[11:52:38] <johnbender> C'MON navigation
[11:53:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: When comparing any part of location with a previously stored value of location, the unit tests need to be modified to compare the decodeURLComponent()-ed versions of both.

[11:54:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, some more unit tests may need to be modified.
[11:54:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: Ah!
[11:54:08] <johnbender> you are right!
[11:54:10] <johnbender> wonderful
[11:54:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I hope that's all that's awry.
[11:55:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: This really sucks BTW. Could use a URL class that's comparable.
[11:55:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: .. to encapsulate all this encoding madness ...
[11:56:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: word
[11:56:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well
[11:56:34] <johnbender> it looks like all the nav failures are duplicated first pages
[11:56:49] <johnbender> I can think of all sorts of good reasons why that would be the case with odd urls
[11:56:55] <johnbender> actually there's a spot I was looking at in init
[11:57:00] * johnbender goes to check that out
[12:03:32] <_|Nix|_> Wow! Android 2.3.5 emits hashchange sync.

[12:06:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup] Add entry to urlHistory before setting hash, because the hashchange caused by setting the hash may happen synchronously, and by the time the hashchange happens, the conditions for the dialog special case must already be in place -- Fixes: #4659 - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:13:48] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Ping
[12:19:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Correct me if I'm wrong: declaring functions inside widget member functions is a bad idea because they'll be instantiated every time the function is called. So, the best practice is to declare all functions as member functions of the widget and call them from one another.
[12:20:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: s/the function is called/the member function is called/
[12:45:25] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi! did you get my message?
[12:49:58] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: pong
[12:52:03] <toddparker> so looks like the popup should be ok in android 2.3.x?
[12:52:45] <agcolom> toddparker: I had a chat with Richard, Karl & Corey yesterday. We've agreed on a strategy for the inline demos for the api docs.
[12:53:45] <agcolom> toddparker: so I think I'll get the 9th widget ready this week (select). And then, I'll incorporate the inline demos.
[12:54:07] <agcolom> After that, I'll get started with another widget...
[12:57:43] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The problem is with centering wrt window.
[12:58:03] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: In Android, the size of the window is the size of the document :-S
[12:58:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The scrollTop() works though ...
[12:59:07] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, if I were to place the popup at $( window ).scrollLeft() + $( window ).scrollTop(), it would be at the top left of the window. Not centered, but at least it would be visible.
[12:59:32] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Right now, when you open a window-relative popup on Android 2.3.5 you have to scroll to the middle of the document to see it.
[13:00:03] <toddparker> great news agcolom
[13:00:06] <toddparker> that is a massive help
[13:00:18] <toddparker> i can't wait to document all the non-widget scripts
[13:00:26] <toddparker> those have been a little lacking
[13:00:52] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: hrm
[13:01:09] <toddparker> can you get width?
[13:01:42] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Nope.
[13:01:57] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The width is also the width of the document.
[13:03:19] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Basically, $( window ).width() and .height() are completely useless, and I dunno if there are any other coords I can check. Nothing seems to give the size of the actual viewport.
[13:03:25] <toddparker> window.outerWidth & .innerWidth
[13:03:34] <toddparker> iOS v5.0 uses window.outerWidth to redeem itself over the lack of the orientation’s effect on screen. It is 320 for portrait viewing, and 480 for landscape viewing. Bam.
[13:03:34] <toddparker> Opera does the same. Bam. Astonishingly, Android v2.3 also nails it. Bam.
[13:03:35] <toddparker> In fact, the only small blot that stops window.outerWidth being the model student is Android v4.0 in landscape: the property often has the portrait value of 320 before the <body> tag is reached. However, this is arguably an edge case, and a very minor misdemeanor.
[13:03:35] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I can try it.
[13:03:40] <toddparker> http://tripleodeon.com/2011/12/first-understand-your-screen/
[13:04:30] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I thought jQuery was supposed to wrap such platform-specific things ...
[13:05:35] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: $( window ).width() and .height() works everywhere else. So, what am I supposed to do now? If I stop using $( window ).width() and .height(), I give up all those other platforms for getting it to work on one: Android 2.3.5 ...
[13:05:58] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Seems like jQuery should patch $( window ).width() and $( window ).height() to make use of the above.
[13:06:31] <toddparker> i agree
[13:06:42] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK, I can file a bug ...
[13:06:45] <toddparker> is DaveMethvin around?
[13:06:51] <toddparker> maybe he knows
[13:06:55] <DaveMethvin> yep, here
[13:07:36] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: So, do you know how come on Android 2.3.5 $( window ).height() reports the height of the document, rather than the visible portion thereof?
[13:07:59] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: $( window ).scrollTop() and $( window ).scrollLeft() seem to work.
[13:08:02] <DaveMethvin> there was a similar iphone issue
[13:08:07] <DaveMethvin> lemme find a ticket
[13:08:21] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Cool!
[13:08:48] <toddparker> DaveMethvin knows all
[13:08:58] <DaveMethvin> does this one look familiar? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6724
[13:09:39] <DaveMethvin> as i recall, we can't get the actual height, it lies to us
[13:10:14] <DaveMethvin> if you test against jquery-git.js does it come out correct?
[13:11:26] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Where do I get jquery-git.js?
[13:12:08] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Found it.
[13:12:12] <DaveMethvin> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js
[13:12:25] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Thanks!
[13:13:18] <DaveMethvin> so the summary on 6724 was: $(window).height gives screensize on iOS, not innerHeight ... is that what you're seeing on Android as well?
[13:13:26] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: if we can't get this to work, we can always fall back to using the origin for the vertical (but ideally centered horizontally)
[13:13:35] <toddparker> and use a feature test to kick this in
[13:14:02] <toddparker> DaveMethvin: have you seen this? http://tripleodeon.com/2011/12/first-understand-your-screen/
[13:14:04] <toddparker> madness
[13:14:15] <toddparker> but it's really what jQ needs to help normalize somehow
[13:14:49] <DaveMethvin> if you know what you want it to normalize to, let us know ... we got 1.8 coming out soon!
[13:15:01] <toddparker> agcolom or uGoMobi - are we all set with the docs changes? i can take a look, but wondering where you think we are
[13:15:18] <toddparker> yes please DaveMethvin
[13:15:21] <toddparker> :)
[13:15:27] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, let ME decide
[13:15:31] <DaveMethvin> i'll fix it
[13:15:42] <toddparker> CASE CLOASED
[13:15:49] <DaveMethvin> $(window).width() should return the color of the top left pixel. done.
[13:17:32] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: It seems to work with git. I'll try to use the info to create a red square that covers the window exactly.
[13:24:23] <agcolom> toddparker: I'm not sure we've agreed on what to do with data-positio-to
[13:24:30] <agcolom> data-position-to^
[13:29:28] <uGoMobi> hi folks
[13:29:37] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi!
[13:29:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes I got your reply
[13:29:49] <uGoMobi> all clear :)
[13:30:03] <agcolom> I was traveling when I realised my mistake!
[13:30:20] <agcolom> what do you think?
[13:30:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom: don't worry, we all make mistakes :)
[13:31:57] <agcolom> just to check something: there are 3 options to set data-position-to:
[13:32:44] <agcolom> I get origin and window... that's easy... the jQM selector, is that just an element on the page?
[13:32:57] <uGoMobi> yup
[13:33:28] <agcolom> ok, so any element, like button, link, select, etc...
[13:33:56] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:34:10] <uGoMobi> $("#myElement")
[13:35:20] <agcolom> great thanks! So I've made some modifications to the docs entry that MauriceG gave us. I've removed the details as I don't think they belong to the data-attribute page. Is that ok with you?
[13:35:30] <uGoMobi> it's just to define the center position of the popup, so it can be centered anywhere
[13:35:59] <agcolom> I've also change the format of that entry, to be consistent with other similar entries.
[13:36:26] <uGoMobi> yes I agree we should leave notes and explanations out of the data-attr. reference as much as possible
[13:36:37] <agcolom> so I think we need to add the details for data-position-to on the popup 'basic' page.
[13:37:04] <uGoMobi> ok, add a paragraph there
[13:40:11] <agcolom> toddparker: we need to add the data-position-to paragraph to http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[13:40:31] <agcolom> toddparker: are you ok to do that?
[13:41:32] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK - this is weird ... the width and height works OK on index.html, but not on docs/pages/popup/index.html ...
[13:42:58] <agcolom> uGoMobi: do you think I should trim it even further (and just have origin | jQuery selector | window) ?
[13:44:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I wouldn't mind if you did... if it's not clear people should visit the popup page and read further
[13:48:19] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, I'm inclined to do that as well...
[13:51:14] <uGoMobi> toddparker: agcolom : see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y-6tRWGU-SLV9gvY8lla4iWxdCCsPQ79XoHI8C0dWjg/edit#
[13:51:33] <uGoMobi> or is it toddmparker_ ?
[13:52:25] <uGoMobi> anyway... does that document represent what we want for the data-attribute reference?
[13:53:49] <uGoMobi> to be clear "Link to popup" is meant as a section right under the popup attributes... smaller heading (no link)
[13:55:05] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, I think this is exactly what we need!
[13:55:36] <agcolom> it can possibly be repeated under link as well in case people go search there...
[13:55:41] <agcolom> ?
[13:55:59] <agcolom> well, data-transition is anyway...
[13:56:25] <uGoMobi> nah, there is note under Link that says it doesn't apply to popup
[13:56:39] <uGoMobi> sorry...doesn't apply to link to popup
[13:56:48] <agcolom> ah :-(
[13:57:33] <uGoMobi> we could change that to... for links to popup see under "Popup"
[13:57:42] <agcolom> ah, sorry, just seen this...
[13:57:43] <uGoMobi> better?
[13:57:56] <agcolom> yes, that would be clear I think/
[13:58:01] <uGoMobi> kk
[13:59:34] <uGoMobi> hmm, not sure how to phrase that... maybe better if you look into that
[14:00:38] <agcolom> ok, which bit?
[14:01:22] <uGoMobi> yes that bit
[14:01:48] <uGoMobi> or arent you anonymous user 690? ;)
[14:02:34] <agcolom> yes, must be ;-)
[14:02:36] <uGoMobi> this might need to be rephrased: "Link" : This doesn’t apply to links to popups (see “Popup”).
[14:03:30] <agcolom> I'm lost!
[14:03:38] <uGoMobi> oh no
[14:04:11] <agcolom> ok, what needs to be rephrased?
[14:04:25] <uGoMobi> anything you think that needs to be rephrased :)
[14:04:54] <uGoMobi> I just wanted to illustrate the structure
[14:05:23] <agcolom> did you see the bit I have added? (it was an attempt at rephrasing what you had but I didn't want ot remove what you had as I didn't want to lose any info until we had agreed :-)
[14:05:32] <uGoMobi> agcolom: what you just wrote down looks good
[14:06:02] <uGoMobi> haha... just delete what you want to delete
[14:08:02] <uGoMobi> I think this was also what toddparker had in mind so if you like you can make the changes on master
[14:08:16] <uGoMobi> if he disagrees we can always change :)
[14:09:28] <agcolom> uGoMobi: just checking something... those data-attributes listed under link, none of these apply to links to popups?
[14:10:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good point.... at first I thought not, but I missed one... data-rel
[14:10:25] <agcolom> data-transition is also for links to popups I guess.
[14:10:30] <agcolom> but data-rel?
[14:10:34] <agcolom> yes...
[14:10:54] <agcolom> how about data-ajax?
[14:11:04] <uGoMobi> not applicable
[14:11:09] <agcolom> ok,
[14:11:14] <agcolom> data-direction?
[14:11:22] <uGoMobi> same
[14:12:07] <agcolom> so data-rel and data-transition go to both?
[14:12:34] <uGoMobi> data-transition... yes
[14:12:45] <uGoMobi> data-rel... I am thinking about best approach
[14:16:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am about to say we should get rid of the whole "Link" section and lists those attribute at "Page" and "Dialog"
[14:16:55] <uGoMobi> Same as we do for popup now.... Links to page, Links to dialog
[14:17:27] <agcolom> oh! that's a bit extreme??
[14:18:41] <_|Nix|_> I really don't get why on the root index.html the window width/height works whereas on the popup/index.html it does not.
[14:19:04] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I think I'd like to keep links...
[14:19:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok
[14:20:06] <agcolom> toddparker: you around??
[14:20:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you try when you remove the height and width attributes from the photo examples?
[14:23:04] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I think I'm going to have to leave this until tomorrow now... I am falling asleep!!!
[14:23:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: of course
[14:23:31] <uGoMobi> get some sleep :)
[14:23:44] <agcolom> thx :-)
[14:24:04] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone :-)
[14:24:14] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne!
[14:26:27] <agcolom> toddparker: uGoMobi prepared a doc illustrating changes that we are thinking of making in the data-attribute, under  link and popup. This proved to be an excellent technique to discuss changes and agree on next moves. The doc can be found at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y-6tRWGU-SLV9gvY8lla4iWxdCCsPQ79XoHI8C0dWjg/edit#
[14:27:58] <agcolom> toddparker: We agreed also that a paragraph/section explaining data-position-to is needed on the popup 'basic' page.
[14:28:47] <agcolom> toddparker: feel free to make the change... otherwise, I can probably do this tomorrow. I'm falling asleep, so best for me to go to bed ;-)
[14:28:56] <agcolom> later all....
[14:29:09] <agcolom> goodnight Jasper :-)
[14:29:23] <uGoMobi> sleep well Anne :)

[14:44:32] <uGoMobi> Latest... 24 seconds instead of 1.5 minute it use to be
[14:44:35] <uGoMobi> new server?
[15:00:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that doesn't sound good
[15:00:23] <johnbender> :(
[15:00:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hmm it might be
[15:01:44] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah seems fine
[15:01:52] <johnbender> must be the new box I know they've been switching things over
[15:02:49] <uGoMobi> johnbender: the build seems ok
[15:03:15] <uGoMobi> johnbender: although I am not sure about the minified file
[15:04:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well at least the location.href is preserved :(
[15:04:08] <uGoMobi> looks like there are line breaks in the minified js
[15:04:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: meaning it doesn't work?
[15:04:59] <uGoMobi> johnbender: haven't test it yet.. hang on
[15:08:56] <uGoMobi> johnbender: looks like somthing is wrong
[15:09:27] <johnbender> sigh
[15:09:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: alright
[15:09:31] <uGoMobi> johnbender: the icon span gets an "Â" inserted
[15:09:36] <johnbender> oh lord
[15:09:46] <uGoMobi> but the page does load
[15:10:05] <johnbender> I'm right on the verge of nailing nav issue

[15:18:45] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm not finding that character locally
[15:19:57] <uGoMobi> johnbender: how do you mean locally? I checked http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.min.js
[15:20:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: on my machine
[15:20:45] <uGoMobi> yes I understand, but you mean you copied that code and can't find it?
[15:21:17] <johnbender> uGoMobi: no I ran the build
[15:21:21] <johnbender> let me try copying it
[15:23:29] <uGoMobi> johnbender: that link is the branch preview right? Latest is on CDN?
[15:24:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: suing http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.min.js the version of the docs running locally appears to be fine
[15:24:07] <uGoMobi> this one http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js
[15:24:07] <johnbender> *using
[15:24:58] <uGoMobi> johnbender: am I correct the docs using branch preview build?
[15:25:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that link works for me as well
[15:25:31] <johnbender> nothing wrong with the buttons or anything :(
[15:25:36] <johnbender> encoding issue?
[15:25:49] <uGoMobi> weird
[15:27:01] <uGoMobi> johnbender: if you open http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.min.js on Google and search for appendChild(c.createTextNode("Â "))
[15:27:09] <uGoMobi> do you see it or not?
[15:27:23] <uGoMobi> on Chrome I mean
[15:28:08] <uGoMobi> it's not in latest: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js
[15:33:22] <johnbender> searching in chrome highlights all lowercase a's
[15:33:39] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah you should look for whole string
[15:34:06] <johnbender> lol wtf
[15:34:08] <johnbender> there it is
[15:34:14] <uGoMobi> already checked local and it's in there just once
[15:35:23] <uGoMobi> and it's not in the unminified version either
[15:35:55] <johnbender> ugh
[15:38:14] <uGoMobi> johnbender: looking for the source file now... I guess there is an &nbsp in there
[15:38:27] <johnbender> uGoMobi: navbar
[15:38:29] <johnbender> check there
[15:38:33] <johnbender> I know wilto added one as a hack
[15:38:34] <uGoMobi> k thank
[15:38:39] <uGoMobi> thanks*
[15:39:05] <uGoMobi> i know Wilto likes to break things ;)
[15:40:24] <uGoMobi> johnbender: buttonMarkup.js.... buttonIcon.appendChild( document.createTextNode( "\u00a0" ) );
[15:40:44] <uGoMobi> encoding issue it is
[15:42:27] <johnbender> figured as much
[15:42:34] <johnbender> wtf is that there for though
[15:42:34] <uGoMobi> still strange it is only in that build, not in the other
[15:42:51] <johnbender> makes sense though
[15:43:01] <johnbender> the minifier reduces the number of characters by converting it to unicode
[15:43:12] <uGoMobi> aha

[15:44:24] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Mat Marquis (4m, 1d ago): This admittedly silly fix seems to solve a number of bizarre problems on Android 2.3, all of which pretain to (empty) absolute positioned elements inside of fixed elements—in this case, absolute positioned icons in buttons in fixed headers—breaking user interaction with elements elsewhere on the page. Most notably, this issue was causing select menus to be eit
[15:44:24] <socialhapy> tap. Test case here: http://wil.to/android-positioning/
[15:44:24] <johnbender> hmm, the proble mis it's converting it incorrectly
[15:44:30] <johnbender> yep
[15:44:32] <johnbender> there it is
[15:45:27] <johnbender> the question is why did that change :(
[15:53:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm curious if we'd have the same issue using &#160;
[15:54:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm getting it in my local build too
[15:54:14] <johnbender> searching in chrome reveals it
[15:55:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: well that prevents the conversion
[15:55:43] <uGoMobi> johnbender: would it matter for the fix?
[15:55:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yes
[15:57:01] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I think this has been addressed in a more recente version of uglify
[15:57:05] <johnbender> I'm going to test
[15:57:39] <uGoMobi> k
[15:58:44] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I don't get it in my local build
[15:59:06] <uGoMobi> it almost sounds like it happens random
[15:59:27] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I get it pretty consistently
[16:00:33] <johnbender> uGoMobi: when I view it in chrome it's wrong
[16:00:52] <johnbender> viewed in emacs it's right
[16:00:53] <johnbender> :(
[16:01:13] <johnbender> uGoMobi: though it doesn't seem to cause issues
[16:01:47] <uGoMobi> I just if that Â is in the minified source
[16:01:56] <uGoMobi> and it's not in my build

[16:05:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi: haha

[16:09:53] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #430 on UglifyJS (Mottie; 1w, 1d ago): Escaped unicode is replaced with ASCII
[16:10:01] <johnbender> now I just need to figure out how to turn that on :(
[16:11:50] <uGoMobi> johnbender: right
[16:12:08] <uGoMobi> but still strange... Chrome interpreted Latest as UTF-8 and Branch preview as ISO-8859-1
[16:12:22] <johnbender> hmm
[16:12:45] <johnbender> uGoMobi: could it just be the encoding that it's serving?
[16:12:50] <johnbender> random sniffing issues?
[16:13:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: would you do me a huge favor?
[16:13:10] <uGoMobi> johnbender: sure
[16:13:13] <johnbender> send a basecamp post to Wilto and let him know what the issues is
[16:13:28] <johnbender> I'd like to, in the short term, switch away from the escaped unicode sequence
[16:13:40] <uGoMobi> k
[16:13:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: switch to the character reference
[16:14:03] <johnbender> &#160
[16:14:06] <johnbender> &#160;
[16:14:16] <uGoMobi> not just &nbsp ?
[16:15:09] <uGoMobi> or is there a difference between both?
[16:15:36] <uGoMobi> anyway... will ask Wilto if &x160; does the trick as well
[16:16:15] <uGoMobi> &#160;
[16:16:20] <uGoMobi> pffff
[16:18:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi:  the difference is subtle but I think they are functionally equivelant in this case
[16:18:34] <johnbender> it might be that the unicode ref was necessary for the hack
[16:18:40] <johnbender> in which case we'll need to figure something out
[16:28:25] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I posted on Basecamp... time for me to call it a day
[16:28:45] <uGoMobi> johnbender: just let me know if there is something I can do... will read it tomorrow
[16:43:05] <johnbender> uGoMobi: thanks much sir!
