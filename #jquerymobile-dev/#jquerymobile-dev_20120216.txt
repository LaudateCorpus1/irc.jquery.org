[07:01:45] <jzaefferer> hey toddmparker_, regarding this article: http://dcurt.is/nothing-makes-sense
[07:02:29] <jzaefferer> Taking that original design perspective into account is certainly nice, but then the article is so silly in various sweeping arguments, makes me wonder if that quotes are just as wrong
[07:04:24] <jzaefferer> Maybe the best feature of the Android platform is the Intents API, which isn't mentioned here at all. And that isn't explained by that "original vision".
[07:05:25] <toddmparker_> yeah, but it did seem interesting to see a bit more of the original ideas in play
[07:06:05] <toddmparker_> that the vision was more low level and less about ui is telling
[07:29:30] <jzaefferer> and that "next level search form" has only -webkit prefixed gradients :p
[07:29:36] <jzaefferer> PS: twitter sucks to comment on retweets
[07:31:51] <Wilto> WHO SAID “ONLY WEBKIT”
[07:38:51] <Wilto> Any combination of the words “webkit” and “only” summons me like some furious genie.
[08:50:28] <johnbender> gs
[08:50:34] * johnbender has the wrong window
[08:52:52] <Wilto> Hey johnbender, no worries on the slider bg thing.
[08:52:55] <Wilto> I’m looking into that now.
[08:53:00] <Wilto> I think Scott’s off the clock today.
[09:10:13] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:13:23] <johnbender> Wilto: I've got it
[09:13:29] <johnbender> Wilto: just spotted it and I'm fixing it
[09:16:11] <johnbender> Wilto: fixed
[09:16:13] <johnbender> adding a test now
[09:17:28] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ping
[09:19:25] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[09:19:44] <gseguin> hey, I'm trying to understand https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3282
[09:19:44] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3282 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (2m, 1d ago): Fool-proof link buttons from button methods
[09:19:53] <gseguin> but without too much success
[09:20:23] <toddmparker_> don't understand the purpose?
[09:20:29] <toddmparker_> or the code?
[09:20:55] <gseguin> toddmparker_: how do you disable a link data-role="button" ?
[09:21:19] <toddmparker_> you can't right now
[09:21:32] <gseguin> oh
[09:22:03] <Wilto> Oh, badass. Thanks, johnbender.
[09:22:06] <toddmparker_> so if you try to use the disable/enable method right now on a link, what happens?
[09:22:15] <gseguin> nothing
[09:22:25] <toddmparker_> it used to do odd things like re-wrap the button each time
[09:22:30] <toddmparker_> but i think we fixed that
[09:22:33] <Wilto> johnbender: Did you scratch the duplicate enhancement going on in there, too?
[09:22:39] <toddmparker_> so this ticket might be closable
[09:22:50] <Wilto> We’re calling buttonMarkup and setting attributes on `handle` twice.
[09:22:56] <gseguin> by using the method you mean: $( "#foo" ).buttonMarkup("disable") right?
[09:23:07] <toddmparker_> but there is the bigger question of whether we should allow links to use all the button methods because people seem to want that
[09:23:42] <toddmparker_> well, people call $( "#foo" ).button("disable") because it's a "button"
[09:24:03] <gseguin> ok that doesn't work either
[09:24:33] <gseguin> actually that one throws
[09:24:58] <gseguin> because a link button is enhanced with buttonMarkup not with button

[10:45:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I think you made the change where the gradeA method was moved to support right?
[10:46:37] <johnbender> gseguin: doesn't that mean that init depends on support?
[10:46:53] <johnbender> the commit messag references a circular dep so I wanted to double check with you
[10:48:38] <gseguin> yes I did that change
[10:51:22] <Wilto> Test-writing question:
[10:51:55] <Wilto> Aaa-ctually nevermind, I think I have it sorted.
[10:52:20] <gseguin> johnbender: is there an issue with that change?
[10:53:12] <johnbender> gseguin: well nothing pressing at least
[10:53:23] <johnbender> gseguin: just that init should depend on support though right?
[10:54:24] <gseguin> that is correct
[10:55:03] <johnbender> that actually doesn't solve the problem I'm working on but I noticed in the process :D
[10:55:47] <gseguin> I'll put it and test
[10:56:25] <johnbender> gseguin: alright, I'm happy to do it to but I wanted to double check because of the note on the circular dep which I didn't want to recreate

[12:05:51] <Wilto> Sorry about that; connection just started flaking out on me.

[12:08:05] <_|Nix|_> Wilto, johnbender: Ping!
[12:08:22] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Hey, sorry about that, dude.
[12:09:17] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: NP. Just wondering about that PR. I've been working on making options work on-the-fly, but I kinda need that reusable button markup for button and select ...
[12:09:40] <Wilto> Did you add tests and such to it?
[12:10:04] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I added the header test.
[12:10:21] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: If in the header make sure the first button has ui-btn-left and the second one has ui-btn-right.
[12:10:41] <Wilto> Cool, cool. I can check that out in a bit.
[12:11:14] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Excellent. The crux for perf is that we must store all options using jqmData for subsequent retrieval.
[12:12:33] <Wilto> I think I follow.
[12:12:42] <Wilto> johnbender, you’re following this stuff too, yeah?
[12:13:40] <Wilto> I gotta run for fifteen, but _|Nix|_: I’ll work on pulling your stuff in once I get back.

[14:16:05] <Wilto> I think I hate Jenkins, you guys.
[14:16:41] <gseguin> starting to grow that feeling too
[14:16:53] <gseguin> but I think it's because of the machine it runs on
[14:18:56] <gseguin> johnbender: did I get my rights revoked on swarm.jquery.org ?
[14:19:02] <gseguin> Jenkins?
[14:20:45] <_|Nix|_> Nighterz y'all!

[14:26:03] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Tweaked styling of legacy-ish loader dialogs. - Mat Marquis
[14:26:41] <gseguin> toddmparker_: yeah sure if there is a page with data-url="foo/bar"
[14:26:49] <gseguin> me thinks
[14:27:19] <toddmparker_> ok so that's a legit bug.
[14:27:40] <toddmparker_> just checking. should we try to get this for 1.1? or can it wait?
[14:28:45] <gseguin> hmm that's weird, I can try to tackle it after my meeting
[14:30:12] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[14:30:13] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #166: FIXED in 4 min 8 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/166/

[14:30:14] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Fixed buttonMarkup tests.
[14:30:14] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Added tests for mini checkboxes/radio buttons.
[14:30:15] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Tweaked styling of legacy-ish loader dialogs.
[14:32:05] <toddmparker_> ok gseguin
[14:33:19] <toddmparker_> Wilto: a less important issue but might be a quick fix...maybe not

[14:33:20] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3594 on jquery-mobile, reported by agcolom (2m, 21s ago): rounded elements are squared in iOS 3.0
[14:37:28] <johnbender> gseguin: shouoldn't have
[14:37:32] <johnbender> gseguin: wan't me to go check?
[14:39:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm not clear as to why that hash issue is a bug
[14:39:27] <johnbender> #hash is a hash reference
[14:39:38] <johnbender> hash/sub is a file reference
[14:39:55] <toddmparker_> that was kind of my Q
[14:39:55] <johnbender> we have to make some distinction there
[14:40:15] <toddmparker_> though our hashes so store page paths, right?
[14:40:18] <johnbender> so if it has the slash and no trailin slash it's a relative path
[14:40:27] <toddmparker_> #docs/pages/forms.html
[14:40:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: not for requests they don't
[14:40:36] <toddmparker_> gotcha
[14:40:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: he's reporting toPage
[14:40:47] <johnbender> not what the hash would look like if replace state was turned off
[14:40:54] <johnbender> I'll respond
[14:40:55] <toddmparker_> riiiight
[14:40:58] <toddmparker_> mind commenting?
[14:41:27] <johnbender> newp not at all
[14:41:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I pestered the shit out of danheberden
[14:41:44] <johnbender> and no dice on the swap file
[14:41:52] <johnbender> the hosting provider charges based on memory/usage
[14:41:58] <johnbender> so a swapfile is an end around and it breaks
[14:42:08] <johnbender> we just have to wait until the move jenkins elsewhere
[14:42:23] <johnbender> and then we'll have to do something about the builds again anyway :D
[14:42:41] * johnbender is scheming on some buildbot
[14:42:55] <toddmparker_> ok, thanks for trying

[16:29:16] <gseguin> I think it's tomorrow
[16:29:18] <johnbender> I don't think I'll attend either way (I'll be at the gym)
[16:29:27] <johnbender> alternatively I could make that my excuse
[16:29:33] <johnbender> not to go to the gym lol
[16:40:53] <johnbender> toddmparker_: not sure if you're around but I responded to the guy about the hashes
