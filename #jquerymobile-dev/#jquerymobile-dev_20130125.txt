[05:04:40] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_ uGoMobi
[05:04:50] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:06:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so im thinking one of us should update https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=172068 
[05:06:50] <arschmitz> and try to make a much simpler test case
[05:07:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I can't reproduce the issue
[05:07:24] <arschmitz> would have to be Wilto: toddmparker: or myself
[05:07:34] <uGoMobi> yes think so
[05:07:45] <arschmitz> has to be on a retina mac i think we are the only ones that have them
[05:07:57] <uGoMobi> probably
[05:08:21] <arschmitz> when i said one of us i meant the team not you or i :) 
[05:09:08] <arschmitz> im just thinking that putting our website as the refrence isnt a good idea too complex
[05:16:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah that's true... we don't like test pages with 3rd party stuff in it either
[05:16:47] <arschmitz> yup
[05:17:05] <arschmitz> gota strip it down to just the relavent markup and css
[05:17:13] <uGoMobi> but the question is... what CSS do you need to trigger the bug
[05:17:20] <uGoMobi> cool
[05:17:20] <arschmitz> exactly!
[05:17:47] <arschmitz> im going to just start cutting untill it stops happening lol 
[05:17:55] <arschmitz> then start putting it back
[05:17:55] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:18:08] <uGoMobi> yeah best approach
[05:18:15] <uGoMobi> good luck with that!
[05:18:18] <arschmitz> lol
[05:18:29] <arschmitz> its such a bad rendering issue i feel like i cant ignore
[05:19:36] <uGoMobi> here is another one.. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5529
[05:19:36] <arschmitz> wow striped it down to the css file and the button markup on a blank page and its still happening
[05:20:07] <arschmitz> so its not too complex of an issue
[05:22:21] <arschmitz> oh wow this is really really basic
[05:23:11] <uGoMobi> all you need is an image? ;)
[05:23:25] <arschmitz> yeah span with background image
[05:23:31] <arschmitz> alignment is off
[05:24:37] <uGoMobi> all CSS you use is background-image and width and height?
[05:41:23] <arschmitz> looks like its the border-radius
[05:44:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you use em value or px for border-radius?
[05:44:31] <arschmitz> we use px so thats what i have
[05:46:59] <arschmitz> ok crazy
[05:47:33] <arschmitz> if i take the url for the icon set
[05:47:56] <arschmitz> and put it in a style tag on page instead of having it come from style sheet
[05:48:01] <arschmitz> the problem goes away
[05:48:34] <uGoMobi> yeah thats crazy indeed
[05:55:33] <arschmitz> hmmm......
[05:55:40] <arschmitz> this might be us after all
[05:56:05] <arschmitz> there is a key difference between a retina and non retina 
[05:58:44] <arschmitz> we have a min-device-pixel-ratio media query that changes the image file
[05:58:55] <arschmitz> if i use the non retina image file it goes away
[05:59:04] <arschmitz> on retina one it shows
[06:07:09] <arschmitz> ok got an awesome demo page for it http://jsbin.com/uzaret/661/edit
[06:10:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://i.imgur.com/QPQcRCK.png
[06:11:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm
[06:12:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't see it on iPad Retina
[06:12:29] <arschmitz> yeah its specific to MAc os X chrome on a retina display
[06:13:06] <arschmitz> did you see the screen shot? it seems to be directly related to distance from the right of the screen
[06:13:32] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:13:48] <arschmitz> it starts out not as bad
[06:13:57] <arschmitz> but when you right click it makes it worse
[06:13:59] <uGoMobi> different Chrome version on iOS
[06:14:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and without the &nbsp; ?
[06:14:31] <arschmitz> makes no difference
[06:15:21] <arschmitz> oh and mouse over does not fix
[06:15:34] <arschmitz> us toggeling the hover class we causeing it to re render
[06:15:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what if you replace inline-block by block + float left?
[06:15:48] <arschmitz> same
[06:15:53] <arschmitz> i had it that way at first
[06:16:01] <arschmitz> and switched to inline-block to check 
[06:16:15] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:16:28] <arschmitz> removing border-radius fixes it
[06:18:03] <uGoMobi> hmm stuff for the Chrome devs if you ask me
[06:18:27] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:19:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see one thing...
[06:19:28] <arschmitz> whats that?
[06:19:43] <uGoMobi> size of the icon sprite is 1680px
[06:20:01] <uGoMobi> and background-size: 842px 18px;
[06:20:06] <arschmitz> right
[06:20:13] <uGoMobi> 2 x 842px = 1684px
[06:20:13] <arschmitz> its compressing it
[06:20:17] <arschmitz> oh ha ha
[06:20:21] <arschmitz> let me try that
[06:20:45] <arschmitz> oh SNAP
[06:20:49] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:20:51] <arschmitz> thats it
[06:20:55] <uGoMobi> pfff
[06:20:57] <arschmitz> its us :(
[06:21:19] <arschmitz> well we can fix a lot faster then they can i guess lol
[06:21:25] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:21:36] <arschmitz> ill fix it right now lol
[06:22:04] <uGoMobi> we better send msg to Paul too
[06:22:16] <arschmitz> yup
[06:22:56] <uGoMobi> still weird I don't see it on Retina iPad... going to check that
[06:23:36] <uGoMobi> and how come it is fixed on hover?
[06:25:44] <arschmitz> hmm not sure 
[06:25:52] <arschmitz> it was made worse by right click too
[06:26:05] <arschmitz> but fixing that fixes the right click issue also

[06:46:16] <toddmparker> morning
[06:46:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker: morning
[06:47:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker: fixed the chrome rendering issue on retina 
[06:47:47] <toddmparker> zomg, really
[06:47:51] <arschmitz> yup
[06:47:53] <toddmparker> how?
[06:47:54] <arschmitz> it was us
[06:48:04] <arschmitz> i was making a simple test page 
[06:48:09] <arschmitz> for chrome issues
[06:48:29] <arschmitz> and showed it to uGoMobi: and he noticed we had the image size wrong for the icon sprite
[06:48:37] <arschmitz> and fixing it makes all the problems go away
[06:49:14] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[06:50:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toddmparker: so fixing that bug had an advers effect
[06:50:43] <arschmitz> EVERY SINGLE background-position: for the icons is now off by 1px lol
[06:52:20] <arschmitz> only on retina though
[06:53:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think the problem is the image not the css its 2px too small
[06:54:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4205
[06:55:17] <toddmparker> in a car, internet is spotty
[06:55:25] <arschmitz> no problem
[06:55:45] <toddmparker> so the sprite is too small?
[06:55:50] <toddmparker> 36px?
[06:55:57] <arschmitz> looks like it
[06:56:02] <toddmparker> can't wait to ditch sprites in 1.4
[06:56:16] <toddmparker> they are a nightmare
[06:57:05] <arschmitz> actually i take that back its not too small
[06:57:14] <arschmitz> its that the icons are aligned wrong i think
[07:01:48] <toddmparker> huh
[07:01:54] <toddmparker> ok, so they need nudging?
[07:02:11] <toddmparker> that requires fireworks to export correctly
[07:04:22] <arschmitz> yeah

[07:07:19] <arschmitz> ill be bback shortly have to run and check on something
[07:12:58] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i realized this morning that when i moved the demos list into a folder, i broke all the links
[07:13:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes I saw that
[07:13:19] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/
[07:13:29] <toddmparker> bad path demos/demos/
[07:13:39] <toddmparker> might need a re-name
[07:13:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: but demos and widget showcase will be two different folders right?
[07:14:13] <toddmparker> i also need to start removing pages from that demo list as widget pages replace 'em
[07:14:16] <uGoMobi> demos is for the real world demos
[07:14:20] <toddmparker> right
[07:14:40] <toddmparker> most of what is on the demo page now will go into widgets
[07:14:48] <uGoMobi> so I thought we can fix links and update index page when we move them to right folder
[07:14:54] <toddmparker> sure
[07:15:44] <toddmparker> messy now, but with some cleanup, it will be clearer
[07:15:56] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:16:02] <toddmparker> root of demos = widget folders
[07:16:08] <uGoMobi> we just need to make sure we keep overview
[07:16:15] <toddmparker> inside /demos/ we should start adding folders for each demos
[07:16:25] <uGoMobi> right
[07:16:55] <toddmparker> a lot of the demos are widgets. one option is to just link them up from widgets
[07:17:06] <toddmparker> and we can re-template later
[07:17:21] <toddmparker> i've been renaming the widget page to index.html
[07:17:33] <toddmparker> so /button/index.html
[07:17:46] <toddmparker> we can have more widget variations inside that folder
[07:18:32] <toddmparker> widget specific variations could stay in widgets. we can link to them from the index
[07:18:49] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:18:52] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[07:19:24] <uGoMobi> we need a convention for title and header h1 as well
[07:19:43] <toddmparker> right
[09:07:20] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:08:07] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: arschmitz: the issue with the icon sprite came with the two new icons
[09:08:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah the alignment is a bit off from when they were trimmed down
[09:09:08] <uGoMobi> yes but also they don't follow the pattern
[09:09:20] <arschmitz> ok
[09:09:41] <arschmitz> i cant fix it anyway i dont have a reasonably new copy of fireworks
[09:10:58] <uGoMobi> I will send mail with the info to toddmparker 
[09:11:35] <uGoMobi> and make some changes in the CSS
[10:23:22] <Wilto> I need some new jams.

[13:41:55] <toddmparker> hey all
[13:41:57] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: pong
[13:43:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Hey!
[13:43:35] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I got two fixes for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5519: A working one, and a better one.
[13:43:50] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I noticed that the demo styles are leaking into the popups. need help with that. see the listviewwidget page, split buttons
[13:43:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The better one comes with a catch: We need to import :tabbable from UI.
[13:44:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9012
[13:44:23] <toddmparker> reading...ok
[13:44:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: scott_gonzalez raises the point that they also define keycodes, which I've seen defined in jQM core as well.
[13:44:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah I also noticed it with the search filter
[13:44:53] <toddmparker> d'oh
[13:44:57] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: fixed that, will look at popup
[13:44:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I proposed that UI split out keycodes and :tabbable, and we grab the resulting file and copy it over.
[13:45:08] <scott_gonzalez> Do you guys ever set ids for ARIA?
[13:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> We need to do that a lot.
[13:45:27] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: i like that idea. we both have keycodes in our respective cores, right?
[13:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why we have .uniqueId() and .removeUniqueId().
[13:45:34] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, like, every widget needs to have an ID?
[13:45:48] <scott_gonzalez> Not every widget, but a bunch of them do.
[13:46:14] <toddmparker> sure, makes sense
[13:46:25] <toddmparker> those would be helpful
[13:46:29] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: In some cases we take the ID of this.element and modify it for the widget constituents.
[13:46:55] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: the widget factory also uses a unique ID for the ._on() bindings, right?
[13:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> Like any time you use aria-activedescendant or labelledby or anything else that takes an id.
[13:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> No, we don't use ids for ._on(), since it just binds to the element.
[13:47:30] <scott_gonzalez> We use unique namespaces though, maybe that's what you're thinking of?
[13:47:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, a monotonically increasing counter.
[13:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> We generate a unique id that we use as a namespace for each widget so that we can cleanly unbind by namespace.
[13:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> .uniqueId() is for the actual id attribute.
[13:48:21] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: what's your thought on how to deal with id's and classes on a widget where you wrap it. for example, if you have a link (id="foo") with a data-role of button, we wrap it in a div for styling. Should we generate prefixed id's or classes on the wrapper (btn-wrap-foo) to make it easier to style or script against?
[13:48:56] <toddmparker> (slightly OT, just remembered to ask you)
[13:49:00] <scott_gonzalez> We don't do anything like that, just have the widget method return the wrapper.
[13:49:06] <scott_gonzalez> Then the user can do whatever they want with it.
[13:49:20] <toddmparker> makes sense
[13:49:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, we're sorely lacking in facilities like that.
[13:49:33] <toddmparker> not easy to write a class tho
[13:49:34] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: We're planning a huge catch-up party for 1.4.0
[13:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: So if you ignore everything that's not old jQuery support and not deprecated, UI core is pretty small.
[13:50:00] <toddmparker> yeah. i want to do a big huddle for 1.4 in the next week or two. 
[13:50:02] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: There should be a common class added to the wrapper.
[13:50:13] <toddmparker> make a big list of refactoring, harmonization items
[13:50:23] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Right, but do I want to copy it over into jQM as is? toddmparker?
[13:50:26] <toddmparker> a structural style like ui-btn, yes
[13:50:50] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: Yup, that's all I would do. Then leave it up to the user to add ids if they want.
[13:50:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, we usually do ui-<widgetname> on the outermost element of a widget.
[13:51:15] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, $( document ).on( "buttoncreate", function( event ) { $( event.target ).attr( "id", ...
[13:51:18] <scott_gonzalez> is pretty simple
[13:51:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, what do you think? Shall I try to copy UI core over?
[13:52:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Then, I can point our keybindings over to the ones in UI.
[13:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Also, if you're going to copy it over as is and rip out the deprecated stuff, feel free to rip out .zIndex() as well.
[13:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> We'll probably drop that soon.
[13:52:52] <arschmitz> Doing that would make it easier for people trying to drop in ui widgets 
[13:53:04] <scott_gonzalez> That was yet another attempt as solving the infinite stacking issues.
[13:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> But now we've got a new system :-P
[13:53:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's just it though. I don't thing we should modify the copy. We've kept the widget factory untouched too.
[13:53:32] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That way we can just drop in a newer one at any time.
[13:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well the widget factory should definitely stay untouched.
[13:53:46] <scott_gonzalez> But UI core is a collection of unrelated functions.
[13:54:08] <scott_gonzalez> I would recommend just removing the old jQuery support and deprecated code.
[13:54:26] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: our cores have different stuff, right? we have some shared stuff like keybindings but we have all our global config in there unless it's been moved out
[13:54:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe we should try to set up a time to talk to scott_gonzalez: to go over changes for 1.4 to make sure we get it all right and dont have to do this again!
[13:54:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, not /all/ our global config, but some, yeah.
[13:55:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's an excellent idea!
[13:55:09] <toddmparker> yeah. we talked to scott_gonzalez about that earlier.
[13:55:20] <toddmparker> id be all for having mobile and ui having the same lean core
[13:55:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: How will this look wrt calendar time. I mean, there is that conference in June ...
[13:55:37] <toddmparker> and we move things like key bindings to a utility
[13:55:52] <toddmparker> same with our globalconfig which is mostly nav-based 
[13:55:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ i think we were pointing for1.4 by then
[13:56:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, UI's core is namespaced to $.ui, whereas ours is namespaced to $.mobile ...
[13:56:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So the meeting would have to take place earlier, eh?
[13:56:25] <toddmparker> yeah, 1.4 is starting now-ish and will probably take 3, maybe 4 months
[13:56:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah probably
[13:56:44] <arschmitz> we are still over 6 months before the conf
[13:56:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Which is good, for now, because we can just point to $.ui from $.mobile ...
[13:56:55] <toddmparker> this is our chance to really sync up with ui, dump any cruft and clean up the API
[13:57:05] <arschmitz> toddmparker: for sure
[13:57:11] <arschmitz> want to make sure we get this right
[13:57:25] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: seems like any change this big is a 1.4 item
[13:57:47] <toddmparker> if you have a lighter fix for that popup bug for 1.3, might be a better option
[13:58:04] <toddmparker> i'd rather button up 1.3, get the RC out,then start tearing stuff up for 1.4
[13:58:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's really ugly though. If you hit "Previous" in the input method, it jumps like crazy.
[13:58:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The UI core is actually orthogonal to everything we do.
[13:58:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Only popup would make use of it.
[13:58:39] <toddmparker> so what are you proposing, sorry
[13:58:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Currently, I've copied the definition of :tabbable into popup.js to make it work.
[13:59:00] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: Will anyone from mobile be in Toronto?
[13:59:17] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: I don't think there will be unfortunately
[13:59:19] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: When is that again, March?
[13:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, second weekend in March.
[13:59:34] <scott_gonzalez> No, first weekend.
[13:59:50] <scott_gonzalez> Just copying the selectors overs is a fine stopgap for now.
[14:00:11] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ and scott_gonzalez - is the plan to break out table into it's own utility? if so, we could do that now for mobile instead of having it in popup
[14:00:31] <toddmparker> :tabbable, oops
[14:00:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think scott_gonzalez was saying that we copy over core, and get rid of the stuff they'll get rid of anyway.
[14:00:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That'll essentially have the same effect.
[14:01:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Just to be clear though: People who use mobile never, ever, ever, ever use UI at the same time, right?
[14:01:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... unless they really know what they're doing, right?
[14:01:58] <toddmparker> i dunno about that
[14:02:04] <toddmparker> i've seen people try and use both
[14:02:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... because I'd hate to see two different versions of UI core being referenced ...
[14:02:17] <toddmparker> for the date picker :)
[14:02:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, well then I think it's best if we copy over the selectors, and that's it, because those are jQuery selector definitions, so they contain no UI-namespaced .... well, anything.
[14:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: There's actually a guard in UI core to prevent dual loading.
[14:02:58] <toddmparker> nice
[14:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.core.js#L20
[14:03:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, but if ours gets loaded first and they use something from the official one, they might end up without it.
[14:03:53] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I guess that's another reason why I'd rather grab the UI core as-is.
[14:04:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Of course, if the two drift apart in terms of up-to-date-ness, then we'll run into the same issue.
[14:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[14:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> I should probably dig in and fix whatever dual proxying issues we have in UI core.
[14:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> And get rid of the guard.
[14:04:54] <arschmitz> ui and mobile are used together by lots of people iv seen
[14:05:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do we have a TODO for merging the projects? I think we've just identified an item for that list.
[14:05:41] <arschmitz> draggable sortable tabs all can just be dropped into mobile with nothing but some custom css
[14:06:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure if we have a merge todo let me check the wikis
[14:06:17] <_|Nix|_> That was actually a question for toddmparker and scott_gonzalez as well ... 
[14:06:25] <_|Nix|_> I accidentally prefixed it with your name.
[14:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we don't plan on fully merging, but there are things we'd like to align.
[14:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> Like getting UI core into mobile, using the same CSS framework, etc.
[14:07:56] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, here's a clear and present need for that :)
[14:08:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: As for the talk with scott_gonzalez I think we should first try to do as much as possible on our own, and then collect a list of questions/dilemmas to run by him.
[14:09:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah that works i just think we should make sure we get it right so there will be no more issues in the future
[14:09:39] <arschmitz> and everything will be consistant
[14:09:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For sure.
[14:10:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think the best solution for 1.3 would be to create js/jquery.ui.tabbable.js and move the definition of :tabbable in there.
[14:10:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the only reason i thought maybe before was to make sure after we spend all sorts of time refactoring widgets we dont miss anything and have to go back 
[14:11:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the beginning stages of our efforts we will have the API docs for the widget factory to guide us.
[14:11:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ so maybe make a list of things we need / intend to fix / change and run that by scott_gonzalez: to make sure we didnt miss anything 
[14:11:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We need to familiarize ourselves with all its facilities, and then go from there.
[14:11:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ of course
[14:12:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I was thinking we probably should disable ajax for whole docs and just enable for demos that require ajax... we have the nav panel with same ID on each page
[14:12:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think that list will populate itself by our looking at the things promised by the factory and not delivered by our widgets.
[14:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> I could do a walk through of everything in the widget factory one day if you want.
[14:12:42] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe on Skype .
[14:13:00] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: id be all for that!
[14:13:08] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: +1
[14:13:36] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ill never refuse some free insight!
[14:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> Why don't you guys figure out a time that works for whoever is interested.
[14:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll almost certainly be available.
[14:14:07] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thank you very much!
[14:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[14:15:37] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: What's your time zone?
[14:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> Eastern
[14:16:09] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK, same as arschmitz. That's good.
[14:16:41] <arschmitz> im nearly always avalible also
[14:17:27] <_|Nix|_> Well, past 15:00 Eastern is not so good for me because that's 22:00 my time.
[14:17:36] <_|Nix|_> ... and my daughter goes to bed then :)
[14:18:17] <_|Nix|_> So, like, 13:00 Eastern is good. Or even before noon, like 10:00 Eastern.
[14:18:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think that probably gives us plenty of wiggle room
[14:18:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. So, I'm pretty much good any day then.
[14:19:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we should still rpobably make sure we have a game plan of our own first so we know if we have any questions right from the get go
[14:19:56] <arschmitz> maybe just kinda fill out that wiki page we made 
[14:20:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's it, right? Do we set this up before we even ship 1.3 ... I don't think so, right? We should first have an idea of the scope of this thing.
[14:20:47] <arschmitz> no i think after 1.3
[14:21:00] <arschmitz> and after like you say we have an idea of the scope of things
[14:21:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm even thinking like a per-widget checklist of things that the UI factory promises and what we have delivered so far.
[14:21:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That should definitely get us going.
[14:21:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah i had started one at some point 
[14:21:36] <arschmitz> i know i have a list of the one's missing destory
[14:21:41] <arschmitz> and i think of ones using on
[14:21:47] <arschmitz> instead of _on
[14:22:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ i think thats as far as iv made it so far
[14:22:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, we need to reexaming our handler leak situration.
[14:23:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think we should be a lot better off than we were.
[14:23:16] <arschmitz> you mean the tabbable?
[14:23:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono. the instances where we attach handlers to elements which are not part of the widget.
[14:24:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like $( document ) and then the widget gets destroyed and the handler stays attached.
[14:24:15] <arschmitz> oh oh yeah
[14:24:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We've gotten rid of a lot of those by using ._on(), but we havent' gone over the library systematically to check for those.
[14:24:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah there is a ticket for that
[14:25:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't think ._on() is crucial for attaching to elements that will be destroyed upon _destroy(), but it is crucial for handlers that attach to $( document ) and $( window ).
[14:26:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes but then you need to make sure you keep careful track of if your binding to something that is going to be removed or now
[14:26:26] <arschmitz> not
[14:26:40] <arschmitz> i think its mest to always use _on inside a widget to make sure
[14:26:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i guess this would be a good question to ask lol
[14:27:12] <arschmitz> is there a strict rule about this sort of thing we should be following
[14:28:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: here is the issue for _on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5294
[14:28:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: See, there's actually another question here: There is no ._one() ... Now, I've tried to achieve it by doing a ._off() inside the handler, but for some reason that didn't work. Maybe I did it wrong or whatever, but it didn't work. So, whenever we do .one(), we run the risk of having the widget get destroyed before the handler fires.
[14:29:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes i remember that
[14:29:32] <arschmitz> another one we should ask about
[14:29:47] <arschmitz> im going to make a wiki for this right now before we forget!
[14:30:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. There's that widget review page ...
[14:30:11] <arschmitz> true just tack it on there for now
[14:32:28] <arschmitz> ok i added those two things
[14:32:35] <arschmitz> we can add to it as we think of more
[14:35:03] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15acrozes opened issue #5531: [jqm1.3.0-b1] data-mini button in a data-role table doesn't work  02http://git.io/F2PEzA
[14:37:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: There's another issue. In order to make sure that the focus chain during the open state of the popup is restricted to tabbables inside the popup, I have to temporarily set the tab index for all other tabbables in the document to -1 so as to kick them out of the focus chain.
[14:38:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: This may be an expensive operation, even if I restrict it to the active page.
[14:38:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Like, $.mobile.activePage.find( ":tabbable" ).each( function() {/* back up tabindex and then set it to -1 */} ).
[14:39:26] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think I'll push the change and we can then test the performance.
[14:40:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah that may be expensive
[14:40:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The current code of jump-back-if-you-find-yourself-losing-focus remains in place in case :tabbable misses some tabbables, but it should never run.
[14:41:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it'll delay the time it takes to open a popup.
[14:41:22] <arschmitz> :(
[14:41:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd like to see this on some of those heavy demo pages.
[14:41:30] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:41:37] <arschmitz> those can really show problems
[14:41:59] <arschmitz> 50 sliders on a page will make android completely give up on trying to work lol
[14:42:25] <arschmitz> slider is one we really need to look at when we are reviewing widgets
[14:42:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think slider is the only one with a move-in-response-to-the-mouse loop.
[14:43:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yes i think so
[14:43:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and that's always a disaster.
[14:43:06] <arschmitz> yup
[14:43:16] <arschmitz> i think it could still be improved a lot though
[14:44:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: A colleague of mine who works on Webkit said that adding a CSS transform would cause the slider to be placed into a layer of its own so that movements of the button would not cause a relayout of the entire document.
[14:44:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Even if it's the identity transformation.
[14:44:26] <arschmitz> hmm neat might have to try that
[14:44:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The idea is that it improves performance at the expense of rendering correctness.
[14:44:56] <arschmitz> yeah that might be ok in this case
[14:45:09] <arschmitz> since you cant really see it well since its under your finger lol
[14:45:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I just hope it doesn't leave rendering artifacts on the apge.
[14:45:28] <_|Nix|_> s/apge/page/
[14:45:36] <arschmitz> yeah would need testing for sure
[14:45:52] <arschmitz> its crazy though performance is fine on ios even on an old iphone 4
[14:46:12] <arschmitz> but on a brand new galaxy nexus with 4.1 it completely dies
[14:50:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Google doesn't know how to spel regression testing ...
[14:50:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: spel you say?
[14:50:58] <arschmitz> lol
[14:51:11] <arschmitz> :)
[14:51:25] <_|Nix|_> [sic]
[14:51:38] <_|Nix|_> ;)
[14:54:00] <_|Nix|_> Well, fsck! It adds over half a second on the form reference page view source popups on my iPod Touch 6.0.1 ...
[14:54:18] <_|Nix|_> This whole :tabbable thing might be pointless.
[14:55:05] <arschmitz> ouch
[14:55:07] <_|Nix|_> Wait a minute!
[14:55:32] <_|Nix|_> NM ...
[14:55:50] <_|Nix|_> The sour outlook remains.
[14:56:12] <arschmitz> this could get really bad if used on a form
[14:56:37] <arschmitz> oh wait you used form ref page never mind and its already bad enough
[14:56:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's not the number of tabbables that affects it but the size of the dom.
[14:57:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Each and every element has to be checked for tabbability.
[14:57:06] <arschmitz> yup
[14:57:29] <_|Nix|_> f0rk ...
[14:57:47] <_|Nix|_> I guess I have no choice but to keep the ugly solution :(
[14:57:51] <arschmitz> dom in jqm can grow pretty fast depending on options too
[14:58:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Tell me about it - one listview and it's over.
[14:58:21] <arschmitz> pre-load and cache EVERYTHING!!!!
[14:58:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess doing global searches is out of the question.
[14:59:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah only way to do that would be to do it as part of pageinit
[14:59:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... unless I collect tabbables at page load.
[14:59:11] <arschmitz> damn lol
[14:59:23] <_|Nix|_> Great minds think alike ... and apparently ours do, too.
[15:00:02] <arschmitz> might not be too horrible when done there but would have to see
[15:00:17] <arschmitz> wouldnt want to make page load noticbly slower!
[15:00:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, it could be done at pageshow, when the page is theoretically already visible.
[15:00:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz:  ... and I could actually make it an idle loop ...
[15:00:56] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/zW4vlg
[15:00:56] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 149195482 15Jasper de Groot: Demos: reorganized folders.
[15:01:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but then it couldn't be a jQuery selector.
[15:01:20] <arschmitz> yeah
[15:01:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd have to yank the guts out and stick 'em in a setTimeout().
[15:01:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... sounds like a plan.
[15:01:41] <arschmitz> yup
[15:01:51] <arschmitz> yeah i think for now at least its the best way
[15:02:10] <arschmitz> should not impact performance
[15:02:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just hope a tight series of setTimeout( function() {}, 0 ) will not be too-too busy.
[15:02:29] <arschmitz> lol yeah
[15:02:45] <arschmitz> think anyone can open a popup quicker then you can loop through elements ha ha
[15:02:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: After all, I'm being as nice as possible.
[15:03:13] <arschmitz> well it wouldnt realy be quicker then you can open
[15:03:22] <arschmitz> but quicker then someone can tab after opening
[15:03:27] <arschmitz> so not an issue i dont think
[15:03:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[15:03:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It would help if I could make a jQuery object and then push to it.
[15:04:04] <arschmitz> why cant you?
[15:04:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cuz I don't want to have an array until the last instant and then convert it to a jQuery object.
[15:04:23] <arschmitz> ok
[15:04:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I guess I can, because they are arrays after all ... I think ...
[15:04:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll ask the core guys.
[15:04:49] <arschmitz> yeah pretty sure because
[15:04:59] <arschmitz> $('#foo')[0] is valid
[15:05:10] <arschmitz> so its an array 
[15:05:36] <arschmitz> i dunno still best to check with core guys
[15:08:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Doing that now.
[15:09:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I suppose it can stay an array and I'll create a jQuery object when I need to. I just hope doing that is not linear in the size of the array, or else it's ... well, not useless if the constant factor is small, but still ... more useless than having the jQuery object there to begin with.
[15:09:28] <arschmitz> yeah
[15:11:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I suppose I can test and see ...
[15:15:38] <toddmparker> sorry i dropped off there, sounds like you guys have a plan?
[15:16:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah _|Nix|_ is testing it now the inital solution was very slow on popup open
[15:16:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, using the selectors from UI as is will not work because it will greatly increase popup open time.
[15:16:23] <toddmparker> no good
[15:16:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, we shall be sneaky.
[15:16:38] <toddmparker> sneaky is good
[15:16:50] <arschmitz> create the list of tabbables right after page show
[15:16:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Upon each pageshow, we will start going over the entire DOM for the page and collect tabbables.
[15:17:06] <toddmparker> can you just see if you're on the last child of a popup and bounce focus back to the first?
[15:17:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: However, we will do so in an idle loop so as not to hang the whole thing.
[15:17:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No. That's the evil thing.
[15:17:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker: we have been copying eachother like this for the last 45 minutes lol
[15:17:25] <toddmparker> heh
[15:17:38] <toddmparker> been there, done that
[15:17:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: There's a fundamental flaw in the whole focus thing.
[15:17:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: When you get a focusout, there is no information as to where the focus is going.
[15:18:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So you have to wait for the focusin.
[15:18:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... to decide whether you like where the focus is going.
[15:18:33] <toddmparker> do you know where it's coming from?
[15:18:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, if the focus is on the last element and I get a focusout, how do I know it's not going back to the second-last element, in which case I don't want to jump to the first element.
[15:19:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Two elements are never present in a focus event.
[15:19:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Only one. The target.
[15:19:14] <toddmparker> gotcha
[15:19:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: And that's what's so evil.
[15:19:34] <arschmitz> i remember talking about this with you two before i even joined the team
[15:19:38] <toddmparker> could you ask if the target is outside the popup and, if so, bounce to the first element in the popup?
[15:19:46] <arschmitz> i think its the first think i ever talked about on this irc channal!
[15:19:54] <toddmparker> yeah? it's a tricky one
[15:20:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: You have to wait for the focusin on the undesirable element before you realize that it's undesirable.
[15:20:18] <toddmparker> sure, but that might be acceptable
[15:20:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and at that point it's too late because the browser has already panned to it.
[15:20:29] <toddmparker> if it's light
[15:20:35] <toddmparker> true
[15:20:44] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, if you then blur it and focus the first element in the popup, you get a nice jerk.
[15:20:49] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thats whats causing the problems your seeing
[15:20:59] <toddmparker> now up to speed
[15:21:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Oh, and on iOS 6 you get a bonus resize too! Don't you just love it?
[15:21:22] <toddmparker> fun
[15:21:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Better yet - you /sometimes/ get a bonus resize too!

[15:21:39] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14fccd2bc 15Jasper de Groot: Demos: updated links in the head
[15:21:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: yeah - unhealthy.
[15:22:10] <toddmparker> if we bounced to the top of the popup when you blur off the last item, the issue there is if you shift+tab = went back instead of forward?
[15:22:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Exactly.
[15:22:26] <toddmparker> that would be messed up
[15:22:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yep.
[15:22:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It'd be counterintuitive.
[15:23:06] <arschmitz> and ios has the next prev btns that make that very easy to do
[15:23:09] <toddmparker> idea: what if we appended a focusable thing right before the end of the popup and add the blur logic to that. on focus or blur, go to the top
[15:23:25] <arschmitz> hmm you would really need 2
[15:23:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: UI does keybinding checking for Shift+Tab vs. Tab, but that's of no use to us because iOS's input method has a button for that and I seriously doubt that it emits Tab/Shift+Tab when you click "Previous" or "Next".
[15:23:30] <arschmitz> one before and one after
[15:23:49] <_|Nix|_> Not bad ...
[15:23:51] <toddmparker> no, but those buttons are essentially the same thing
[15:23:55] <arschmitz> yeah that could work
[15:24:08] <toddmparker> but our little focus trapper could do the trick
[15:24:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: An item with a tabindex but with 0 width/height.
[15:24:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly
[15:24:26] <toddmparker> the only thing is it would make the "next" button active
[15:24:32] <toddmparker> but whatever. 
[15:24:48] <arschmitz> yeah i think thats a fair compromise
[15:24:50] <toddmparker> h4cks
[15:24:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's fine, because clicking the next button will move focus to the first item, so that's not necessarily bad.
[15:25:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It'll turn the string into a loop.
[15:25:10] <toddmparker> title="back to top of popup"
[15:25:23] <_|Nix|_> Meh ... *shrug*
[15:25:24] <arschmitz> yeah this seems like it could work really well
[15:25:40] <_|Nix|_> Alright. Back to square 0.
[15:25:40] <arschmitz> without a performance hit
[15:25:41] <toddmparker> right, at least it keeps focus in
[15:25:54] <toddmparker> but we can be dumb. no need to search the dom
[15:25:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and there's always the fallback logic which is what we have now.
[15:25:58] <arschmitz> it allows to to make a little container to trap it in
[15:26:08] <toddmparker> right
