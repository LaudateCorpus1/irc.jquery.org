[04:04:30] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jzaefferer opened issue #5429: Listview breaks when used without .ui-page  02http://git.io/FoHnjw
[04:17:10] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi gseguin|away toddmparker: opened 6 months ago and not resolved today: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder/issues/8 - is anyone working on the download builder?
[04:18:05] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: gseguin is download builder specialist
[04:19:19] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: I know he has been very busy
[04:19:33] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: will ask him to look into it
[04:19:47] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: okay, thanks
[04:20:42] <uGoMobi> np
[04:21:37] <jzaefferer> any guesstimate when 1.4 will land?
[04:21:48] <jzaefferer> weeks, months, years?
[04:25:43] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: we are about to release 1.3 beta and 1.4 should follow in approx 3 months
[04:26:04] <jzaefferer> okay
[04:26:08] <uGoMobi> currently aiming at 4 releases a year
[04:26:28] <jzaefferer> that doesn't help me for my three week prototyping project, but could work for whatever happens afterwards
[05:01:12] <toddmparker_> I do wonder if there are short short term fixes we can make to prevent issues when widgets are used outside a page, even for 1.3 final
[05:01:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: check if it is in a page
[05:01:57] <arschmitz> then if it is set a varible to ui-page-active
[05:02:19] <arschmitz> use that in place of .ui-page-active everywhere
[05:02:27] <arschmitz> or something along those lines should work
[05:03:17] <arschmitz> and it would have to be on the first / every page and would not get pulled in with ajax
[05:04:18] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: i had all ready been thinking about this a bunch because it annoyed me the issues with having a panel on every page and managing id's
[05:04:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: would make persistant toolbars much better too
[05:09:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: iv been thinking about logic for managing their life cycle too
[05:11:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: and basicly just remove all refrences to .ui-page and similar too
[05:11:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: good morning
[05:11:47] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:33:34] <toddmparker_>  arschmitz: yeah, is there anything that would be a quick hit there?  if we can't find a parent ui-page, fallback to some defaults. is this mostly theming logic? if so, it's not critical. we could just fallback to swatch a
[05:34:18] <toddmparker_> i think we auto-wrap in a page div if one isn't there but that must be a nav thing.
[05:34:40] <toddmparker_> if you just want to use a widget like lists or forms, that shouldn't care about pages
[05:34:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: no its more then just theming because a lot of pages look for a parent in the widget and use .ui-page-active in the css
[05:34:45] <toddmparker_> hey uGoMobi

[05:35:04] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker_ 
[05:35:18] <toddmparker_> how goes it on panels
[05:36:01] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: maybe ill start a branch today and pick a widget to try and free from pages
[05:36:03] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: z-index is causing me a headache
[05:36:45] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: the three widgets i thought would most benefit from being outside pages are panels popups and fixedtoolbars
[05:37:14] <uGoMobi> changes in z-index can fix blink in one browser but at the same time it messes up another browser
[05:37:45] <toddmparker_> not surprised
[05:38:05] <toddmparker_> we spent days playing with different things and every move would break some other browser
[05:53:37] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: cool
[05:54:01] <toddmparker_> even if there are smaller things we could do before we hit 1.3 rc1 for some key widgets...dunno
[05:54:24] <toddmparker_> might have to wait for 1.4 to touch anything, but right now we error out so anything is better

[07:56:45] <arschmitz> Wilto: so i just made something intresting Truely persistant toolbars that can live outside a page
[08:02:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: how goes the fight with panels?
[08:05:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, but Android WebView is still an issue with position fixed
[08:06:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i thought you already had that fixed? (no pun intended ) or is this a new different issue?
[08:07:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the way I made it work on WebView broke things in the browser
[08:07:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh ok
[08:09:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: was just curious had seen you do a bunch of commits on it
[08:51:09] <johnbender> gseguin: sure
[09:33:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz Wilto: do you guys feel like testing panels in branch panel-refactor-part2 on some iOS devices?
[09:33:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure
[09:33:29] <uGoMobi> I didn't merge master so swipe to close it still broken there
[09:33:47] <arschmitz> i still have it open on everything from last night ha ha 
[09:34:11] <uGoMobi> clear the cache :)
[09:34:18] <arschmitz> ha ha of course
[09:34:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: one sec.. I don't see my last commit here on irc

[09:35:06] <uGoMobi> 10 mins later...
[09:35:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: dosent it take an hour for branch previews to update?
[09:35:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[09:35:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thought you tested local
[09:35:57] <arschmitz> i cant with ios i cant port forward here
[09:36:06] <arschmitz> i can pull it to my server though
[09:36:24] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Do I ever.
[09:36:32] <Wilto> Which iOSes? All of ‚Äôem?
[09:36:34] <uGoMobi> ah ok, well no problem to wait for branch preview
[09:37:31] <uGoMobi> Wilto: just check a view
[09:37:54] <Wilto> Any ol‚Äô iOS? What‚Äôve you been testing in?
[09:40:10] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I tested iOS6 on BS
[09:42:51] <uGoMobi> oops... s/check a view/check a few/
[09:51:39] <johnbender> toddmparker: are you going to join the jquery tech cabal today?
[10:03:54] <johnbender> uGoMobi: Wilto: toddmparker: gseguin: arschmitz: new post is up on hacker news if you feel inclined to upvote :) http://news.ycombinator.com/newest
[10:04:00] * johnbender has little shame
[10:04:48] <arschmitz> oooo part 2 
[10:05:42] <arschmitz> johnbender: i thought part 1 was well done
[10:05:53] <johnbender> arschmitz: thanks man :)
[10:09:13] <arschmitz> johnbender: Ill have to read part 2 later dont think i have time right now
[10:09:24] <johnbender> arschmitz: no worries
[10:09:38] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's a marathon post
[10:09:45] <arschmitz> johnbender: hacking on makeing some widgets work outside of pages
[10:09:52] <johnbender> arschmitz: ahh nice
[10:10:07] <Wilto> johnbender: What‚Äôs up with all this ‚ÄúMATH IS LYING TO YOU‚Äù stuff I‚Äôm seein‚Äô lately?
[10:10:14] <arschmitz> so far i have "set free" fixedtoolbars buttons and navbar
[10:10:31] <Wilto> arschmitz: Set them free into the woods somewhere, miles and miles away from any of us.
[10:10:50] <Wilto> uGoMobi: A-testing I will go.
[10:11:07] <Wilto> The previews updated yet? GitHub is crawling.
[10:11:16] <uGoMobi> lemme check
[10:11:45] <arschmitz> Makes persistant toolbars easy no tracking or anything put some toolbars outside the page and they live forever
[10:12:13] <arschmitz> and dont need to worry about page transitions because they are no longer part of the page
[10:12:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: Wilto : yes, http://jquerymobile.com/branches/panel-refactor-part2/docs/panels/index.html has been updated
[10:12:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool ill check it out
[10:12:37] <Wilto> Sweet.
[10:13:07] <djMax> I have an embedded web view (in a mobile app) where I want the page context to live "a long time." So I'm trying to be careful about things like infinitely growing history. Is there a way to reset/go back in history to the "first" page of this jQuery mobile page?
[10:13:16] <djMax> or some way to turn off the building of history at all?
[10:13:45] <djMax> sorry, misread topic. Moving.
[10:13:57] <Wilto> djMax: No worries, man. Thanks!
[10:14:04] <johnbender> Wilto: don't read the math just upvote on HN :)
[10:14:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: iphone4 ios5 looks better
[10:14:34] <arschmitz> smoother
[10:14:58] <arschmitz> reveal still isnt perfect the toolbars seem to not line up with the content durring open or something weird
[10:15:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ios6 ipad 2 is perfect though
[10:17:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is a glitch in push mode
[10:18:13] <arschmitz> clicking on the page does not close the panel
[10:18:19] <arschmitz> it just toggles the footer
[10:19:14] <arschmitz> hmm this is an issue on /test/ too though execpt it does nothing since there is not a fixed footer
[10:19:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we disable click on the page to close panel in push mode above 55em (880px)
[10:19:53] <arschmitz> ah oh that explains it
[10:20:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the footer size changes though when you tap toggle with push panel open
[10:20:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup works fine under that width ok soo cool all looks good here 
[10:20:38] <uGoMobi> that is something I still have to fix
[10:20:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i noticed that too
[10:21:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great! thanks for testing!
[10:21:30] <arschmitz> ios6 looks great ios5 reveal has a minor glitch in animation but i think its just the phone isnt fast enough
[10:22:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe we can fix that
[10:22:57] <uGoMobi> .ui-panel-animate.ui-panel > *,
[10:22:57] <uGoMobi> .ui-panel-animate.ui-panel > * > *,
[10:22:57] <uGoMobi> .ui-panel-content-wrap > * {
[10:22:57] <uGoMobi> 	-webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
[10:22:57] <uGoMobi> }
[10:23:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i cant tell its either part of the page content background disappears or the toolbars move slower then the content it happens so fast
[10:23:22] <uGoMobi> that cool looking rule... apply to fixed toolbar too
[10:24:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its the content background disappears for sure now that i do it a few times in a row
[10:24:25] <uGoMobi> all blinks are gone on Android 4.1 too
[10:24:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: awesome
[10:25:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will think of a couple of rules we can try to improve reveal on iPhone 4 iOS5
[10:26:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool 
[10:27:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its only on panel open for some reason too
[10:27:32] <uGoMobi> another issue is that you don't see the border styling that we set for push panel... this is because of z-index
[10:28:28] <toddmparker> johnbender: aw, sanp. i'm in a clien tmeeting.
[10:28:32] <toddmparker> mind doing an dupdate
[10:28:34] <uGoMobi> probably a small change... 
[10:28:38] <toddmparker> targeting beta early next week
[10:36:41] <Wilto> johnbender: Upvoted, for Science.
[10:40:31] <Wilto> uGoMobi: 3d-ing everything was causing us a lot of trouble on newer Androids.
[10:40:50] <Wilto> I think me, Scott, and Jeff all took a crack at it, and ended up in the same place.
[10:41:12] <Wilto> jlembeck: Es verdad?
[10:42:25] <Wilto> ANDREW. I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN YOU‚ÄôD BE BACK.
[10:42:27] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I tested on Galaxy Nexus and it fixed the blinking
[10:42:35] <Forte> Foresight
[10:42:37] <Wilto> Forte: uGoMobi and I could use a hand testing some stuff.
[10:42:46] <Forte> Alright, sounds good
[10:44:09] <Wilto> uGoMobi: It‚Äôs really hit-and-miss though from device to device.
[10:44:17] <Wilto> I think we gotta lock the CSS down.
[10:44:17] <jlembeck> Yeah - Wilto, uGoMobi, 3ding everything caused a few issues
[10:45:51] <jlembeck> I seem to remember an issue with anti-aliasing on font as well
[10:46:59] <Wilto> Ah, yeah.
[10:47:03] <Wilto> Forte: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/panel-refactor-part2/docs/panels/index.html
[10:47:41] <Wilto> Forte: Gotta check it in a webview, though. So, save it to the home screen or open it up via an app or somesuch.
[10:48:14] <Wilto> jlembeck: Yeah; it‚Äôs the whole ‚Äúturning elements into a bitmap-py thing and transforming that‚Äù deal. Fonts get weird.
[10:48:58] <jlembeck> also, worth noting, ios6 has disabled that hack
[10:49:03] <jlembeck> (the translate3d one)
[10:49:05] <jlembeck> http://indiegamr.com/ios6-html-hardware-acceleration-changes-and-how-to-fix-them/
[10:49:12] <Wilto> Huh.
[10:49:52] <uGoMobi> we still set -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; for iOS6
[10:51:49] <uGoMobi> I know that 3d-ing can can cause anti-aliasing problems
[10:52:14] <uGoMobi> let me know if you see any of this while testing
[11:00:24] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Forte is iOS testin‚Äô over here.
[11:00:46] <uGoMobi> great
[11:04:55] <Wilto> jlembeck: Which were the most ‚Äútroublesome‚Äù Androids with 3D kicked in? ICS+, yeah?
[11:06:33] <jlembeck> I believe so, toddmparker and scottjehl______ found those issues, I didn't have a device to test those on
[11:10:58] <johnbender> toddmparker: there was some question about the new jqm api site release (timeline) and when there was room in the anounce schedule for a beta or rc
[11:11:10] <johnbender> toddmparker: I would get in touch with rworth
[11:15:02] <toddmparker> i'm thinking the API site would launch with 1.3 final
[11:15:36] <rworth> toddmparker that's what we wondered
[11:15:47] <rworth> so you wanna do jquerymobile.com and blog.jquerymobile.com at the same time?
[11:19:19] <toddmparker> rworth: yeah, that would be ideal
[11:19:53] <toddmparker> the site stuff has been sidelined but if you have the bandwidth to help us get this into shape, it would be cool too have a new site, blog and api site
[11:19:59] <rworth> ok, you think around mid-Feb-ish (just looking for a ballpark)
[11:20:04] <toddmparker> the site is pretty light, just a handful of pages
[11:20:26] <toddmparker> that's probably realistic
[11:20:29] <rworth> yeah. We don't have them on the schedule yet through the end of Jan, but we're putting them on the early Feb schedule
[11:20:30] <rworth> cool
[11:20:41] <toddmparker> awesome
[11:20:48] <toddmparker> sorry i missed the call(s)
[11:20:54] <toddmparker> been crazy busy here
[11:20:58] <rworth> np
[11:21:08] <rworth> glad we caught up here. I'd been meaning to get with you on this
[11:24:33] <toddmparker> yeah, agreed
[11:24:44] <toddmparker> holidays and an upcoming release threw me off
[11:46:54] <johnbender> toddmparker: I think we should cut a beta after tomorrow's meeting
[11:47:01] <johnbender> known issues aside
[11:55:21] <Wilto> friggin‚Äô computers
[11:55:27] <Wilto> Alright Forte, we‚Äôre good. http://wil.to/51
[11:55:33] <Wilto> Points to my local machine.
[11:55:45] <Wilto> If you save that to the home screen, you‚Äôll get a chromeless webview.
[12:06:49] <Forte> got it
[12:08:21] <Forte> Working fine in iOS 5 and 6.
[12:14:32] <toddmparker> johnbender: i think as soon as we're happy with panels, we can cut the beta
[12:14:50] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_ Wilto arschmitz - where are we at with that business?
[12:14:56] <johnbender> toddmparker: we may end up opting chrome ios out of popstate :(
[12:14:59] <toddmparker> out of my meeting btw
[12:19:08] <arschmitz> hi toddmparker:
[12:21:18] <Wilto> I‚Äôll be damned.
[12:21:29] <arschmitz> Wilto: ?
[12:21:48] <Wilto> uGoMobi: This 3D stuff is working fine on Android 4.
[12:22:08] <Wilto> scottjehl______: You here?
[12:22:12] <uGoMobi> Wilto: great
[12:22:40] <Wilto> I mean‚Ä¶ confusing, but hell. Results are results.
[12:23:59] <jlembeck> +1 I like it.
[12:24:12] <uGoMobi> Wilto: was quit a puzzle 
[12:24:14] <arschmitz> Awesome
[12:24:17] <uGoMobi> but it fixes the blinks
[12:24:45] <uGoMobi> and didn't see any downsides with these settings
[12:25:44] <Wilto> Hm.
[12:26:09] <Wilto> All I can figure is that we were kicking in 3D more or less the same way you did, but we were still using 2D transforms.
[12:26:35] <Wilto> ‚Äîwhich caused blinking at the start/end of the animation because the 2D/3D context was changing.
[12:26:42] <Wilto> DAMMIT JLEMBECK
[12:27:06] <uGoMobi> yeah, I changed everything to 3d and made sure it was applied already to the element before transition
[12:27:21] <jlembeck> I'll pack my things.
[12:27:56] <uGoMobi> so what needs to be done now is putting option position fixed back in because I gave up on Android WebView with position fixed
[12:28:04] <Wilto> Nicely done, uGoMobi 
[12:28:10] <uGoMobi> thanks
[12:28:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Nice and webview ehh oh well lol
[12:28:36] <uGoMobi> yeah lol
[12:28:43] <Wilto> Sounds like iOS WebViews are looking good, yeah?
[12:29:27] <uGoMobi> need to update the docs too... nixed some classes
[12:49:30] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm looking at upgrading to grunt 0.4
[12:50:12] <gseguin> any reason why we used dependencies in the package.json instead of devDependencies?
[12:51:16] <gseguin> oh I'm silly, the name of the package is jquery-mobile-build, ok, nevermind
[12:59:31] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: sounds like you might have pulled off a miracle
[13:07:38] <toddmparker> johnbender: i think kicking chrome out until it gets it's act together may be fine
[13:07:45] <toddmparker> just on iOS, right?
[13:09:45] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: my only question is whether we think fixed panels should be the default
[13:10:05] <toddmparker> with it off, do transitions look smoother? i'd imagine they would
[13:10:09] <toddmparker> esp. on android 4
[13:14:35] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: transitions look smooth on Android 4.1 with position fixed
[13:14:47] <uGoMobi> at least on Galaxy Nexus
[13:15:24] <uGoMobi> it's only WebView
[13:15:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: all blinks are gone too
[13:16:38] <Wilto> Markedly mo‚Äô smoother without fixed?
[13:17:13] <Wilto> Oh, toddmparker just asked.
[13:19:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you are magic
[13:19:05] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/c1n2lg

[13:19:08] <toddmparker> i was more curious about 4.0
[13:19:21] <toddmparker> that is much shakier with this stuff in general
[13:22:03] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: on 4.1 I don't see any difference fixed or absolute... can you guys test there on a 4.0 device?
[13:23:27] <uGoMobi> thing is that for positionFixed false I am also going to set the fixed toolbars to position absolute
[13:23:50] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Doin‚Äô so now.
[13:23:58] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[13:24:10] <toddmparker> nice
[13:25:52] <uGoMobi> maybe we can set default to true at least for beta so people going to test with position fixed
[13:26:18] <uGoMobi> if too many issues with performance we can change the default to false for RC
[13:26:26] <Wilto> Absolute doesn‚Äôt seem any better on Android 4.
[13:26:39] <Wilto> I *would* rather default to false, though, truth be told.
[13:28:16] <uGoMobi> Wilto is there any difference between master and that branch? on android 4.0
[13:31:53] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/vYAdhg
[13:31:54] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14e8aade0 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: made the example for makeUrlAbsolute a bit more specific
[13:32:40] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: guess the default is an easy change so we can mull it over
[13:33:02] <toddmparker> i'd rather default to the thing that is less tweaky personally
[13:33:13] <gseguin> johnbender: is our codebase lint free?
[13:33:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok
[13:33:23] <toddmparker> if a dev adds a FB style menu button in the top toolbar, fixed down't get 'em much
[13:33:43] <uGoMobi> true
[13:34:17] <rworth> toddmparker https://twitter.com/cliffsimpkins/status/289119972901416961
[13:34:18] <toddmparker> we could add fixed to the panel that we open far down the page so that looks ok
[13:35:41] <Wilto> rworth: Sweet.
[13:36:23] <johnbender> gseguin: is the build failing?
[13:36:27] <toddmparker> thanks, just replied
[13:36:28] <johnbender> gseguin: and we don't lint the tests
[13:36:38] <Wilto> uGoMobi: I tested that a little while back, and the refactor is smoother.
[13:36:38] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah just on iOS
[13:37:06] <uGoMobi> Wilto: ok good to know
[13:37:26] <uGoMobi> and thanks for testing
[13:37:27] <toddmparker> johnbender: +1
[13:38:18] <uGoMobi> ok the default for position fixed is going to be "false"
[13:39:01] <toddmparker> cool, let's live with that for a bit and see if we miss it
[13:39:07] <uGoMobi> I just noticed the active state is only removed from the close button in the panel just before you open it again
[13:39:22] <toddmparker> as long as we have demo pages with the permutations, we can test those for comparison
[13:39:38] <uGoMobi> you can see it being removed if you try overlay or push mode :(
[13:39:46] <Wilto> johnbender: IRC is so much less noisy this way.
[13:39:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: very true
[13:39:50] <toddmparker> let's improve that
[13:39:51] <Wilto> It‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs wonderful.
[13:40:00] <johnbender> Wilto: hows that?
[13:40:07] <Wilto> Irssi.
[13:40:12] <johnbender> Wilto: no notifications?
[13:40:18] <Wilto> Just seems like I‚Äôm tripping over it less.
[13:40:24] <johnbender> Wilto: :)
[13:41:01] <Wilto> Growl on mentions of me if inactive, and a five-line window at the top that lists mentions/messages.
[13:41:13] <Wilto> Nothing gets lost, but not in my face either.
[13:45:53] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah it has plenty of lints
[13:46:10] <gseguin> that's ok though I'll just make it work and we'll fix the lints later
[13:55:17] <toddmparker> anyone look at this panel code?  http://m.inze.it/
[13:55:27] <toddmparker> does look nice, at least on iOS
[13:55:37] <toddmparker> (from a comment this morning in the tracker)
[13:59:31] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I looked at it
[14:01:29] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/fwqpLw

[14:06:30] <agcolom> toddmparker: that page causes an error on FF
[14:08:41] <Wilto> Error, you say.
[14:09:36] <Wilto> Oh, that other panel.
[14:09:48] <Wilto> That other not-as-cool-as-ours panel. Pssh.
[14:10:43] <Wilto> agcolom: How we lookin‚Äô on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380 ?
[14:12:54] <agcolom> Wilto: checking now...
[14:14:13] <agcolom> Wilto: you guys totally rock! It is fixed!
[14:16:00] <Wilto> agcolom: Still one of those fixes that makes me a little uneasy.
[14:16:11] <Wilto> agcolom: Do you have a little testing time?
[14:16:20] <agcolom> Wilto: sure
[14:16:22] <Wilto> I wouldn‚Äôt mind running that through a couple of browsers, juuuust in case.
[14:16:35] <agcolom> yes...
[14:17:52] <agcolom> just let me know what you need me to test and which browsers
[14:17:58] <toddmparker> agcolom is a good at finding bugs
[14:18:06] <toddmparker> you're our FF tester
[14:18:07] <Wilto> Oh, just wanna make sure the table doesn‚Äôt look screwed up.
[14:18:21] <toddmparker> yeah, try your older safari and such
[14:18:35] <Wilto> Just any browsers you have laying around.
[14:18:42] <uGoMobi> I don't think our scrollIntoView function for panel is working as expected
[14:19:06] <Wilto> The fix‚Äîwhich is nonsense‚Äîis that `display: table` wouldn‚Äôt cause the table to work normally once the contents were changed back to `table-row` and `table-cell`.
[14:19:20] <Wilto> `display: line-anything-else` did.
[14:19:29] <Wilto> like-anything-else*
[14:19:30] <agcolom> do you have the link please (just to make sure I don't use an old one!)
[14:19:37] <Wilto> Oh, it‚Äôs in master now.
[14:19:59] <agcolom> for the tables or panels?
[14:20:53] <agcolom> (I think I saw something weird with panels the otehr day, but not sure whether it was a finished version...)
[14:25:55] <agcolom> all ok (tables) on FF17
[14:26:06] <agcolom> I've just downloaded FF18 now!
[14:27:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: latest version panel is not on master yet, it's in a branch
[14:30:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: going to finish option positionFixed tomorrow, I have to look at scrollIntoView too because that doesn't seem to work correct (also not on current version on master
[14:31:13] <agcolom> tables all fine in FF18 also
[14:32:19] <agcolom> Hi uGoMobi: would you have the url for panels please ? (I think I saw a weird behavior the other day...)
[14:32:48] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom - http://jquerymobile.com/branches/panel-refactor-part2/docs/panels/index.html
[14:33:20] <agcolom> tables: all ok on Chrome Version 23.0.1271.101 
[14:33:34] <agcolom> Thank you Jasper :-)
[14:36:44] <toddmparker> sounds promising
[14:37:15] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: seems like your panel re-factor can go in when you're ready. checks out here
[14:37:53] <agcolom> all seems fine for me (panels and tables)
[14:37:55] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am glad it checks out and turns out to be an improvement
[14:38:16] <toddmparker> yeah, nice work
[14:38:33] <toddmparker> any idea why the panels don't' have padding? did those styles get wiped on the index page?
[14:38:35] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: some minor things to look at, but seems like we can merge tomorrow
[14:39:07] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, my mistake.. I placed <style> in the head
[14:39:14] <toddmparker> i still believe you got fixed headers to play nice
[14:39:21] <toddmparker> ah!
[14:39:31] <uGoMobi> so you have to refresh
[14:39:48] <toddmparker> ok
[14:40:00] <toddmparker> i still don't think the swipe to close is working
[14:40:04] <uGoMobi> will put it back in the body
[14:40:06] <agcolom> hold on... I may have something on chrome...
[14:40:09] <toddmparker> at least not in the branch preview, that can be old
[14:40:13] <uGoMobi> will remove the fixed footer too
[14:40:26] <toddmparker> think this is a good demo page for sure
[14:40:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes the swipe fix is on master, I didn't merge master in the branch
[14:40:46] <toddmparker> or take my more realistic panel demos and add a fixed footer so we can keep tabs on it
[14:40:53] <agcolom> ok, it's not just chrome, and maybe it's the expected behvior...
[14:41:00] <toddmparker> on this test page, we can probably not have fixed toolbars at all
[14:41:53] <uGoMobi> yes fixed footer example in demos is good idea but lets keep this doc page clean... I agree we better remove position fixed from both header and footer
[14:42:33] <agcolom> ok, on panels, here's the bug:
[14:42:39] <Wilto> Oh, panels.
[14:42:44] <Wilto> You had me nervous, agcolom.
[14:43:00] <agcolom> Wilto: sorry :-) all seems fine for tables :-)
[14:43:08] <Wilto> Agreed! Whassup with panels?
[14:43:34] <agcolom> maybe it's just me testing something noone is supposed to do...
[14:43:58] <agcolom> so on the panel page, press right panel push
[14:44:15] <uGoMobi> and tap on page to close doesn't work
[14:44:31] <uGoMobi> (wild guess)
[14:44:53] <agcolom> then if the beginning of the page is not visible, make your window a bit wider, so you can see the buttons
[14:45:03] <agcolom> (and the left part of the page)
[14:45:18] <agcolom> then press right panels reveal
[14:45:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think I know what you mean
[14:46:00] <agcolom> you can't close the right panel and if you make your window narrow the panels moves under the buttons
[14:46:13] <uGoMobi> if you open reveal panel when push panel is still open things get messy
[14:46:17] <agcolom> seems consistent across browsers
[14:46:24] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes
[14:47:04] <uGoMobi> I think we have to prevent opening a panel when another panel is open
[14:47:06] <agcolom> but with overlay, if you press anything it just closes the panel
[14:47:15] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[14:47:20] <Wilto> Where we at with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4956? toddmparker, uGoMobi?
[14:48:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks... going to look into it tomorrow
[14:48:12] <uGoMobi> Wilto: arschmitz asked the same yesterday
[14:48:15] <agcolom> uGoMobi: you're welcome :-)
[14:48:45] <uGoMobi> Wilto: see thread https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5223
[14:49:08] <Wilto> Oh, whoops.
[14:49:16] <uGoMobi> I have the CSS for this so I can make a demo
[14:49:40] <Wilto> Cool; I can tag in if you‚Äôre still working on panel stuff.
[14:50:21] <Wilto> The last two issues apart from that are scary Benderthings.
[14:50:22] <uGoMobi> Wilto: it's just that I wanted to give Keith a chance to finish what he started
[14:50:42] <uGoMobi> but looks like he doesn't have time to finish it
[14:51:05] <Wilto> Ahh.
[14:51:17] <Wilto> Well, we can grab some of his CSS or somethin‚Äô.
[14:51:48] <uGoMobi> I haven't seen him around lately
[14:52:10] <uGoMobi> so maybe we should take care of it
[14:52:24] <Wilto> Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. Just wanna whittle the list down to zero.
[14:53:03] <Wilto> Nothin‚Äô against him, of course.
[14:53:06] <uGoMobi> I have few other demos (table styling, slider tooltip label) I want to finish first when I am done with panel refactor
[14:53:13] <Wilto> Oh, nice.
[14:53:38] <uGoMobi> we also need some panel demos
[14:53:46] <Wilto> johnbender: Should I get after https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5428 ?
[14:54:06] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Oh, want me to whip up a couple of those? I figured we were keeping that demo page as-is.
[14:54:26] <johnbender> Wilto: if you're comfortable moving the $.mobile namespace out into it's own module
[14:54:36] <johnbender> I was going to aske everyone if they're ok with that tomorrow
[14:55:10] <uGoMobi> Wilto: just a few different examples that are also useful for testing.... with/without fixed toolbars, long list in panel, etc.
[14:56:02] <Wilto> johnbender: I can always spin up a branch.
[14:56:04] <uGoMobi> Wilto: that page in the docs can stay how it is... we can probably remove fixed toolbars there, at least the fixed footer
[14:56:10] <johnbender> Wilto: so true!
[14:57:04] <johnbender> Wilto: you might put it in the js/jquery.mobile.ns.js or some such
[14:57:20] <Wilto> THE MOTION CARRIES.
[14:57:27] <gseguin> johnbender: any reason why you didn't use the requirejs plugin for grunt?
[14:57:50] * gseguin realizes he might be missing something obvious
[14:57:50] <johnbender> gseguin: it wasn't available at the time?
[14:57:59] <gseguin> ok, makes sense
[14:58:04] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't recall seeing anything about it and I thought just droping into node made sense
[14:58:11] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't think I looked though
[14:58:16] <johnbender> iirc
[14:58:25] <johnbender> so it could have been lazyness too I suppose
[14:58:35] <johnbender> gseguin: dunno, the call to require is pretty small
[14:58:41] <johnbender> gseguin: what does the plugin do?
[14:59:05] <uGoMobi> Wilto: toddmparker : I think we should also check 1.1.2 / 1.2.1 open issues
[14:59:06] <gseguin> don't know exactly but it seems to work
[14:59:34] <gseguin> johnbender: where I'm stuck right now is in the concat task
[14:59:53] <johnbender> gseguin: do what you have to do man, just don't mess up the build :)
[14:59:55] <gseguin> johnbender: I get a: `Cannot read property 'srcRaw' of undefined`
[14:59:55] <johnbender> hahaha
[15:00:12] <Wilto> but uGoMobi there are more of those
[15:00:16] <gseguin> I can hear that laugh
[15:00:40] <johnbender> gseguin: when I moved the build over to grunt my test was, build - swap branches - build - diff
[15:00:54] <johnbender> the only difference whould be the headings with the commit hashes
[15:00:59] <johnbender> *should
[15:01:01] <Wilto> johnbender: +1 from Scott Jehl.
[15:01:05] <gseguin> yep that's what I'll do
[15:01:17] <johnbender> Wilto: on the ns?
[15:01:20] <Wilto> Yeah.
[15:01:22] <johnbender> cool
[15:01:27] <johnbender> Wilto: yah go for it
[15:01:43] <johnbender> sorry for not doing it in the first place
[15:02:02] <johnbender> man
[15:02:12] <johnbender> we need to de-prefix the files in the root of the js/ dir
[15:02:19] <Wilto> DAMMIT, JOHNBENDER
[15:02:19] <johnbender> that has always bothered me
[15:02:28] <johnbender> we can do that after the release though
[15:02:43] <Wilto> but how will people know they are for jquery
[15:03:06] <Wilto> But yeah, seriously, that drives me nuts.
[15:03:11] <johnbender> lol exactly
[15:03:18] <jlembeck> +1
[15:03:46] <jlembeck> I'm trying to autocomplete names here, having to type j - tab - at the beginning of it every time hurts
[15:05:02] <Wilto> jlembeck: J + tab twice here.
[15:05:07] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: sure. once we get beta out, we can fix and new or old issues until we hit rc
[15:05:18] <toddmparker> though I'd like to move to rc within 2 weeks if we can.
[15:05:20] <Wilto> Command line IRC, jlembeck. *Get on my level*.
[15:05:26] <toddmparker> from beta
[15:05:45] <toddmparker> i also want to get some maintenance releases out
[15:06:06] <toddmparker> maybe between 1.3beta and rc, we should do 1.1.2
[15:06:11] <toddmparker> and close that out
[15:06:27] <toddmparker> we can also get a 1.2.1 out soon after
[15:06:38] <gseguin> Wilto: next step is lynx, isn't it?
[15:06:38] <toddmparker> jlembeck is going to help me automate some change log stuff
[15:06:51] <Wilto> gseguin: Only a matter of time.
[15:06:57] <jlembeck> ah yes, I've gotta teach you how that thing works
[15:07:00] <Wilto> Pine actually sounds kind of awesome, if I‚Äôm being real.
[15:07:04] <toddmparker> gseguin: are you looking at adding a note to the download builder re: that css as a short term thing?
[15:07:14] <toddmparker> i think linking to the actually file would be awesome
[15:07:31] <gseguin> toddmparker: relatively short term yes
[15:07:54] <gseguin> getting familiar with grunt right now
[15:08:22] <Wilto> Rrgh, 6:00pm. I‚Äôm out, guys; catch up with you in the morning.
[15:08:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: sounds good
[15:08:44] <gseguin> nothing to do with that bug but I want to progress on the grunt migration
[15:08:49] <uGoMobi> Wilto: good night
[15:08:56] <gseguin> later Wilto 
[15:10:33] <uGoMobi> johnbender: this doesn't look like something for maintenance release https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3654 ... 1.4?
[15:13:40] <uGoMobi> well we can cleanup 1.1.2/1.2.1 milestones later
[15:13:53] <uGoMobi> I am going to call it a day
[15:13:58] <uGoMobi> later guys
[15:15:48] <ajpiano> toddmparker: https://twitter.com/jeremyburto/status/289121130445422592
[15:16:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: its addressed in the new nav
[15:16:56] <johnbender> can be closed an milestoned at 1.3
