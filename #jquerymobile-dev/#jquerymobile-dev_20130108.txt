[07:08:50] <toddmparker> morning all
[07:09:01] <uGoMobi_> morning toddmparker
[07:09:09] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi_ 
[07:09:14] <toddmparker> how goes?
[07:10:02] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker arschmitz : I managed to get panel with position fixed to work on Android WebView but comes with other issues
[07:10:18] <uGoMobi_> so still a lot to look into
[07:10:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what did you do?
[07:11:27] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: long story short... looks like setting position left/right together with the translates messes things up
[07:11:34] <toddmparker> interesting
[07:11:58] <uGoMobi_> by using a opposite translate to set the default position i got it to work
[07:12:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: strange
[07:12:26] <toddmparker> so here's my question: if we take position fixed out of the equation for panels, how many of our issues go away? we still need to support fixed headers.
[07:12:58] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: I am testing with fixed headers
[07:13:06] <toddmparker> cool
[07:13:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think it would help most of them
[07:13:24] <toddmparker> i just wonder if fixed pos on the panels themselves are causing too many headaches
[07:13:43] <toddmparker> 99% of the time, people will have the buttons that open panels at the top of the screens
[07:13:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yesterday you said the blinkyness of the panel was helped too?
[07:13:50] <uGoMobi_> actually I also had a solution which didn't require hiding the fixed header during panel transition
[07:14:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: really?!
[07:14:24] <uGoMobi_> yeah, but I didn't test that on iOS yet
[07:14:36] <toddmparker> gotcha
[07:14:54] <uGoMobi_> the idea is basically to not wrap the header when it is fixed
[07:15:16] <uGoMobi_> just apply transition to it as well
[07:15:31] <uGoMobi_> that worked nice on Android in the browser
[07:15:55] <toddmparker> interesting
[07:15:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that would make more sense markup wise too not moving stuff all around
[07:16:09] <uGoMobi_> yup
[07:16:21] <toddmparker> do you guys have time today to keep hammering on this?
[07:16:33] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: I still saw blinkiness on on the panel with push, not with reveal
[07:16:34] <toddmparker> i'll be in meetings (ugh) all afternoon
[07:16:51] <toddmparker> but I can throw a filamenter in here to help out too
[07:16:52] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: yes, I keep working on this
[07:16:56] <arschmitz> i have some time to help if there is anything you want me to look into uGoMobi:
[07:17:05] <toddmparker> maggie and mat can test anything you need
[07:17:26] <toddmparker> and i can ask mat to help you out uGoMobi_ 
[07:17:27] <uGoMobi_> ok cool
[07:19:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: just let me know what i can do if you need anything
[07:20:17] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: thanks, I will
[07:50:02] <toddmparker> Wilto: I summon thee
[07:50:18] <toddmparker> we have voodoo css work to do with uGoMobi_ 
[07:50:57] <Wilto> Uh-oh.
[08:04:46] <Wilto> uGoMobi_: What‚Äôs the score, man?
[08:07:23] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: I tried a lot of things yesterday and today to fix the Android / iOS panel issues
[08:07:39] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: found a solution for most of them
[08:08:08] <uGoMobi_> but those were individual fixes... putting it all together now
[08:09:06] <uGoMobi_> but some fixes for Android WebView are causing new problems for Android/iOS browser
[08:09:49] <uGoMobi_> I still feel I can win this game :)
[08:10:12] <Wilto> Excellent.
[08:10:37] <Wilto> I say, when in doubt, hack things back.
[08:10:46] <Wilto> ‚ÄúMinimum viable‚Äù etc.
[08:11:40] <Wilto> I‚Äôm gonna look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380 in the meantime, but we wanna chuck some test pages together for panels:
[08:12:13] <Wilto> Fixed panel, fixed panel with fixed header, static panel fixed header, and fixed panel static header.
[08:12:38] <Wilto> uGoMobi_: Are you looking at the issue where the transition disappears when stuff ain‚Äôt fixed?
[08:13:54] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: basically I am looking at all issues mentioned at the ticket for slide panel
[08:14:02] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5163#issuecomment-11954594 ?
[08:14:18] <toddmparker> i do think we should probably default to fixed panels being false and maybe even pull that out completely if it's trouble. we can always add it back in later as a feature.
[08:14:47] <Wilto> Yeah, I was just gonna say.
[08:15:25] <uGoMobi_> I agree
[08:15:35] <Wilto> We could have that hinge on an optional header/footer-style `data-fixed` attribute, on the panel.
[08:15:44] <Wilto> Since we‚Äôre gonna be sharing the blacklist and all.
[08:15:54] <Wilto> I assume. I hope.
[08:16:47] <uGoMobi_> if it's ok with you guys I would like to keep working today on the solutions I found
[08:16:53] <uGoMobi_> that is with position fixed
[08:17:33] <Wilto> Sure thing. Just don‚Äôt hesitate to bail if it feels like you‚Äôre spinning your wheels, yeah?
[08:18:08] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: yeah
[08:18:28] <toddmparker> sounds like a plan
[08:18:32] <Wilto> I think we‚Äôd rather just dial it back and get this thing shippable. I mean‚Ä¶ I can see the appeal of the fixed approach on these, but fixed spirals into a lotta fun bugs in a hurry.
[08:18:51] <uGoMobi_> true
[08:19:10] <Wilto> For some value of ‚Äúfun.‚Äù
[08:19:10] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: are you also making sure we think about fixed footers too? we missed that one :)
[08:19:23] <Wilto> no such thing todd
[08:19:24] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: yes
[08:19:38] <uGoMobi_> already added fixed footer on page in docs to test
[08:19:43] <uGoMobi_> and added the CSS
[08:19:56] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: is restoring animations to panels when fixed is false also on your plate? if not Wilto or jlembeck could pick that one off
[08:20:04] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: great!
[08:20:17] <Wilto> Yeah; just point me at something, uGoMobi_.
[08:20:24] <Wilto> LEMME AT ‚ÄôEM.
[08:21:04] <toddmparker> i think i eventually want to have the docs page not use the fixed header. figure we can use the demos to cover all the various scenarios since some will be less slick. i'd rather the docs page looks good and works well which means no fixed header/footers
[08:22:20] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: what do you mean by restoring animations to panels when fixed is false?
[08:22:41] <uGoMobi_> if I get it to work there will not be an option position fixed anymore
[08:24:35] <Wilto> uGoMobi_: When you disable the fixed panel, it just snaps into place.
[08:24:58] <Wilto> Which seems like it might be a fairly quick fix.
[08:25:13] <Wilto> uGoMobi_: Check it: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/panels/panel-nav-form.html
[08:25:34] <Wilto> I can dig into that, if you wanna stay the course on what you‚Äôre doin‚Äô now.
[08:26:38] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: I saw toddmparker mentioning that issue
[08:27:00] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: but my intention is to remove the option positionFixed
[08:27:12] <uGoMobi_> so that will also resolve this problem
[08:27:35] <uGoMobi_> the option was added because panels didn't work on Android WebView with position fixed
[08:27:50] <uGoMobi_> but I got them to work with position fixed
[08:28:24] <Wilto> Ah-hah.
[08:30:09] <jlembeck> "Yeah; just point me at something, uGoMobi_." <- That
[08:30:26] <jlembeck> Anything you want me to tackle first?
[08:30:43] <Wilto> jeff you are too late everything is done now
[08:30:50] <uGoMobi_> lol
[08:32:05] <jlembeck> sweet. I'm gonna go play Mario Kart
[08:32:19] <uGoMobi_> :D
[08:33:01] <uGoMobi_> jlembeck: thanks, I'll continue with putting all my bits and pieces of CSS together
[08:33:23] <uGoMobi_> jlembeck: I will let you and Wilto know when I have something to look at
[09:17:26] <Wilto> gseguin: MAKE UP YOUR MIND, MAN
[09:18:12] <Wilto> uGoMobi_: Nice. I‚Äôm gonna look at the busted swipe issue, I think.
[09:19:38] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: what busted swipe issue?
[09:20:05] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: swipe to close doesn't work?
[09:20:35] <Wilto> Nosir.
[09:25:01] <Wilto> Yeah, just confirmed on /test
[09:28:08] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: I remember from the swipe demo that I made that $( document).on("swipe", ".selector", function(){...}); worked, while $( ".selector").on("swipe", function(){...}); didn't
[09:28:57] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: might be the cause
[09:29:07] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: so I went back and I removed the timeout
[09:29:16] <Wilto> Weird. We had it working at one point, but that might be it.
[09:29:18] <johnbender> the only tests that are failing are the initial dialog hash tests in sequence
[09:29:22] <arschmitz> johnbender: Good Man! lol
[09:29:26] <johnbender> I'm going to address that directly
[09:29:30] <johnbender> that's why it's taking so long
[09:29:53] <johnbender> arschmitz: the logic I had originally to address the problem was sound but I was being semi lazy about dealing with the other cases
[09:29:58] <johnbender> the popup forced me to reconsider :/
[09:30:20] <johnbender> paragraphs of comments :(
[09:30:48] <arschmitz> johnbender: lots of explaining to do?
[09:30:54] <johnbender> yah
[09:31:26] <arschmitz> Good to have detailed info on stuff like this so in the future we are not left wondering why
[09:34:00] <arschmitz> johnbender: the work you have done with the new nav is really impressive
[09:34:32] <johnbender> arschmitz: lol, well I'm waiting to see how it fairs when the users get ahold of it
[09:34:38] <johnbender> then we'll know for sure whether it was worth it
[09:35:02] <arschmitz> johnbender: im already using it in a project and so far its actually a lot less buggy then the old nav i would say
[09:35:31] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah the solid split between hashchange and popstate made a big difference I think
[09:35:43] <johnbender> and I addressed some corner cases in the forward/back logic
[09:36:02] <arschmitz> johnbender: i found one weird thing but it was super edge case and i couldnt say for sure it was nav related so i worked around it
[09:36:15] <johnbender> arschmitz: hmm what was it?
[09:36:39] <arschmitz> johnbender: on one particular page with an i frame when the iframe loaded it would kick me back to the very first page 
[09:36:50] <johnbender> o.O
[09:37:06] <johnbender> arschmitz: I've had issues with iframes and the nav
[09:37:19] <johnbender> arschmitz: I did a preso with like 30 iframes each with a jqm page
[09:37:34] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah because navigating an iframe is a history change
[09:37:40] <arschmitz> so it can cause all sorts of issues
[09:37:42] <johnbender> in chrome, sometimes when I hit the back button it would jump the slide page up 20px
[09:38:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: tough to support that
[09:38:14] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah thats why i didnt bother mentioning before
[09:38:22] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool, just making sure
[09:38:27] <Wilto> I blame jlembeck.
[09:38:42] <jlembeck> I'm cool with that.
[09:39:11] <Wilto> ?cc
[09:39:11] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[09:39:48] <arschmitz> johnbender: like on essentially unfixable issue is if you have an iframe that navigates itself in a popup trying to close the popup just navigates the iframe back lol
[09:40:24] <Wilto> arschmitz: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvgxf6ydVH1r2fzujo1_500.gif
[09:40:56] <arschmitz> Wilto: but does it ever fall?
[09:41:05] <Wilto> We may never know.
[09:41:28] <arschmitz> Wilto: then how do we ever know if we are actually awake?
[09:43:43] <arschmitz> johnbender: but anyway my point just was iframe nav issues are generally not fixable because its something in the iframe out of our control
[09:48:39] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah, crazytown
[09:49:07] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'm thinking we should deprecate hash assignment as a means of navigation
[09:49:23] <johnbender> scottjehl______: uGoMobi_: _|Nix|_: kinblas: Wilto: ^
[09:49:35] <johnbender> I'm supporting it currently but it's the source of many many bugs
[09:50:12] <johnbender> or I should say complexity
[09:50:25] <johnbender> It's the source of a lot of complexity
[09:52:46] <arschmitz> johnbender: I think if it will solve a lot of issues im +1
[09:53:25] <kinblas> johnbender: doesn't that assume support for push-state? What about all the old opera-based devices?
[09:53:25] <arschmitz> johnbender: if someone wants to programaticly navigate they should use changepage
[09:53:53] <johnbender> kinblas: they would use $.navigate
[09:53:56] <Wilto> I‚Äôm always in favor of paring stuff down.
[09:53:59] <johnbender> which uses hash assignment
[09:54:04] <johnbender> but controlled hash assignment
[09:54:25] <arschmitz> johnbender you just mean like window.location.hash = "/blah/"
[09:54:29] <arschmitz> right?
[09:54:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: yes
[09:54:39] <arschmitz> yeah i say ditch it 
[09:55:03] <johnbender> kinblas: the new nav works both ways but there's a lot of complexity to support assigning the hash outside of the tools provided
[09:55:08] <johnbender> had to for the test suite :)
[09:55:58] <kinblas> johnbender: oh, are you just talking about bottle-necking all navigation through some abstract function so the rest of the system doesn't care/know how urls are being managed?
[09:56:04] <kinblas> If so, I'm all for that :-)
[09:56:12] <johnbender> kinblas: yah for the most part
[09:56:20] <johnbender> kinblas: that's how I'm able to achieve history management
[09:56:26] <arschmitz> johnbender: out of curiosity if you do this and someone does set the hash what would happen?
[09:56:26] <kinblas> +1
[09:56:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: I haven't thought of that
[09:56:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: in my world it would throw an exception :)
[09:56:54] <johnbender> lol
[09:57:20] <_|Nix|_> Usually one framework and one framework alone handles the nav.
[09:57:27] <_|Nix|_> If not, well, expect the unexpected.
[09:57:33] <arschmitz> johnbender: was just curious 
[09:57:45] <johnbender> arschmitz: I'll have to think about it
[09:57:57] <johnbender> that would be a problem though because it would screw up our understanding of history
[09:58:13] <johnbender> arschmitz: I mean we could explicitly tell people to NOT use it and leave the handling in there
[09:58:20] * johnbender shrugs
[09:58:21] <arschmitz> johnbender: would be nice if we could just ignore it somehow
[09:58:23] <johnbender> have to think about that
[09:58:32] <johnbender> arschmitz: can't because it creates a history entry :/
[09:58:37] <johnbender> so we have to match that
[09:58:45] <johnbender> an exception would actually be the best
[09:58:52] <johnbender> "BRO, KNOCK IT OFF"
[09:58:59] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah i think i would even be fine with an execption or something like you said 
[09:59:10] <arschmitz> i was just curious about the what if someone does it anyway
[10:00:22] <arschmitz> johnbender: as long as its well documented i guess it does not matter what happens lol
[10:00:36] <arschmitz> if someone does it anyway we say hey read the docs and STOP IT 
[10:00:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Could we not identify an unexpected hashchange by setting a flag before we perform our own hashchange manipulation? ... a flag which we unset from the hashchange handler.
[10:00:43] <Wilto> johnbender: How do you make an exception that deletes their current working directory?
[10:00:47] <Wilto> Is that a thing? Let‚Äôs do that.
[10:01:22] <toddmparker> "BRO, KNOCK IT OFF"
[10:01:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If we can do that, and we know at all times where we are in history, we know wherefrom to delete the remaining history and replace it with the unexpected entry.
[10:02:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that would defeat the purpose of reducing complexity :)
[10:02:34] <arschmitz> johnbender: i think thats the only way to go an execption saying "BRO, KNOCK IT OFF" no other wording will do 
[10:02:47] <Wilto> I think if we add enough complexity, it goes full circle and ends up reducing it.
[10:03:26] <toddmparker> hey - once we get the panel wonkiness squared, is there anything else standing in the way of 1.3 beta?
[10:03:53] <toddmparker> i'd like to get that our within the next week, ideally earlier. maybe monday?
[10:03:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think we might be able to get away with not handling this case and just referring to the documentation if someone does it anyway.
[10:04:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right that was my original thinking, but that's going to be a support hassle
[10:04:42] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'm sorting out the last bits of this issue with opera/ie and the popstate event
[10:04:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Maybe so, but at least it'll get 1.3 out.
[10:04:52] * johnbender is in hate with popstate implementations
[10:04:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: oh yah for sure
[10:05:04] <arschmitz> johnbender: thats why you throw the "BRO, KNOCK IT OFF"
[10:05:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: deprecate and then we'll figure that out later
[10:05:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We currently have the same problem with other-framework interoperation.
[10:05:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, if nav becomes independent, we can always say "You don't like the way we handle nav? Well don't use it then!"
[10:06:35] <toddmparker> heading into a long meeting fellas
[10:07:05] <arschmitz> toddmparker: have fun!
[10:07:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think we provide enough value even without nav, and nav itself adds tremendous value.
[10:07:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Vaya con dios!
[10:09:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: I've got a green run of tests with my current setup
[10:09:29] <arschmitz> Very Nice!
[10:09:35] <_|Nix|_> Excellent!
[10:09:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: there is a timeout, but it's a one time thing to handle the initial popstate from chrome
[10:09:53] * johnbender grumbles
[10:10:03] <arschmitz> johnbender: cool thats not soo bad 
[10:10:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Bah! No big deal ...
[10:10:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: in the grand scheme of things it's the least bad solution
[10:11:02] <arschmitz> johnbender: its a break even you ditched the other one net zero lol 
[10:11:16] <johnbender> arschmitz: well the other one was a timeout on ever nav
[10:11:24] <johnbender> so it's a big improvement
[10:11:30] <arschmitz> so even better thats a huge gain then
[10:17:57] <arschmitz> johnbender: the two base tag issues for 1.3 should i just re milestone those for 1.4?
[10:18:11] <johnbender> arschmitz: probably :(
[10:18:12] <johnbender> ugh
[10:18:18] <johnbender> I really wanted to get that sorted
[10:19:31] <arschmitz> johnbender: since those "shouldnt" be breaking changes for current stuff could those go in a maintnence release? so i could take like 1.3.1 or 1.2.1? 
[10:19:47] <arschmitz> so they dont have to wait for 1.4?
[10:19:57] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's technically a feature
[10:20:02] <johnbender> but we could cheat if we want to
[10:20:03] <arschmitz> johnbender: true
[10:20:26] <arschmitz> johnbender: its up to you on those i was just looking at whats still open for 1.3
[10:20:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah lets do it for a maintenance release
[10:20:48] <johnbender> and maybe we can do a quick one after 1.3
[10:21:07] <arschmitz> johnbender: johnbender: we still have 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 pending ha ha 
[10:21:16] <johnbender> lulz
[10:21:25] <johnbender> it's ok to go back and do those releases after the face
[10:21:28] <johnbender> fact
[10:21:35] <johnbender> some people don't want to upgrade they just want bug fixes
[10:21:40] <arschmitz> and how about your simple nav issue can that be closed since its merged?
[10:26:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Wilto: so heres something fun we may want to look at. if you have a panel and dont set an id (i know not really supported but still) ANY link on the page will open it
[10:29:27] <Wilto> Huh.
[10:29:33] <Wilto> is that a feature tho
[10:30:38] <arschmitz> Wilto: a feature to hijack all links for itself lol?
[10:37:25] <Wilto> Yes.

[10:43:24] <johnbender> lol
[10:43:34] <arschmitz> Wilto: that does not seem like a good feature
[10:44:02] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok lol 
[10:51:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Unfortunately, I think Chrome iOS is till broken ...
[10:51:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: sigh
[10:51:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Opera is fixed now, but Chrome iOS behaves as if navigating did not generate any history.
[10:51:39] <johnbender> that one's going to be tough
[10:51:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I can click any number of links to go from page to page, but as soon as I hit "Back", I'm back to the empty tab.
[10:52:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: wow that's bad
[10:52:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Maybe we'll just have to turn off history for it.
[10:52:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: are you testing on an iphone or in a simulator
[10:52:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: iPod.
[10:52:53] <johnbender> I don't have an ios device
[10:52:56] <johnbender> hmm
[10:53:02] <johnbender> maybe my wifes company ipad is lying around
[10:53:20] <johnbender> nice 
[10:53:21] <johnbender> got it
[10:53:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: iOS 6.0.1 and Chrome 23.0.1271.100
[10:56:17] <johnbender> yah I think it's up to date here
[10:56:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. So, open Chrome and behold the h0rkage ...
[10:57:15] <_|Nix|_> (that word lends itself well to pronunciation using a French intonation)
[10:57:31] <johnbender> mother fucker
[10:57:42] <_|Nix|_> ... speaking of French ...
[10:57:44] <johnbender> yah it doesn't add a history entry
[10:57:54] <johnbender> _fucking bullshit_
[10:58:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was thinking maybe we keep calling $.mobile.back until we run out of history, but I doubt it.
[10:58:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's possible but not likely
[10:59:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm going to open a separate issue

[11:01:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I don't even think it executes any of our code when you hit the back button, because I had a synchronous AJAX-based console.log implementation and I never got any logs back.
[11:01:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I placed console.log statements inside _handleHashChange and the new hashchange and popstate handlers and nothing.
[11:01:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I can try with alerts ...
[11:01:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nah I'll give it a whirl
[11:02:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Too bad you can't use that vaunted Android remote debugging ...

[12:35:25] <arschmitz> johnbender: ^^ those sound great
[12:36:02] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah the container widget is, I have convinced myself, the right abstraction for doing all the other Nav stuff
[12:36:06] <gseguin> Wilto: sorry, testing the Weechat client and was having trouble with the plugins, so lots of restarts
[12:36:18] <Wilto> gseguin: Hah, no worries.
[12:36:20] <johnbender> I'm sure there are bits we could split out in there (base tag) but it's a good place to start
[12:36:29] <Wilto> I actually ended up going with Irssi.
[12:36:35] <johnbender> Wilto: FUCK YAH
[12:36:43] <gseguin> Wilto: yeah I saw that, why?
[12:36:58] <gseguin> Wilto: to have johnbender on your side?
[12:36:59] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: if you guys want to get connected with ircrelay let me know I'll help
[12:36:59] <Wilto> And you, johnbender, just proved that my Growl script is working.
[12:37:07] <johnbender> :)
[12:37:37] <gseguin> yeah so that is my problem right now with Weechat
[12:37:51] <gseguin> can't figure out how to make it work with growl
[12:38:21] <gseguin> johnbender: what's the purpose of ircrelay ?
[12:38:28] <johnbender> gseguin: its a proxy
[12:38:40] <johnbender> so you stay connnected even if your lappy isn't
[12:38:41] <gseguin> like jquery's znc?
[12:38:41] <Wilto> I also added a wee tiny window to which I pipe all my  mentions/messages.
[12:38:45] <Wilto> And it is dope.
[12:38:45] <johnbender> gseguin: exactly
[12:38:50] <johnbender> gseguin: or you can use that :)
[12:38:54] <Wilto> I got the jQuery ZNC goin‚Äô here.
[12:38:56] <johnbender> somehow I keep forgetting it exists
[12:39:01] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[12:39:04] <johnbender> just use that
[12:39:04] <gseguin> I'm already using znc
[12:39:27] * johnbender sees that he's not wanted here
[12:39:28] * johnbender leaves
[12:40:08] <gseguin> no don't leave johnbender !
[12:40:11] <Wilto> This Irssi thing and my sudden and irrational love thereof feels like a major step towards writing Battlestar Galactica fan-fiction in my spare time.

[12:41:09] <Wilto> I mean, it‚Äôs a good show. So.
[12:41:18] <gseguin> :)
[12:47:48] <johnbender> Wilto: are you a Big Bang Theory fan?
[12:48:05] <Wilto> Weirdly enough, I have strong opinions on that show.
[12:49:00] <Wilto> Mostly about how it is an entire show built around the concept of ‚Äúhaha they‚Äôre different from us!‚Äù
[12:50:29] <johnbender> Wilto: yah I don't like it at all
[12:50:31] <johnbender> _at all_
[12:50:36] <johnbender> I resent it when people tell me I would like it
[12:50:53] <Wilto> AGREED.
[12:50:56] <johnbender> I tweeted a post on it, and I thought it captured what's wrong about it pretty well
[12:51:10] <Wilto> Wait, just now?
[12:51:11] <Wilto> I missed this.
[12:52:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it looks like the delays associated with adding alerts kind of sort of fix the problem
[12:52:37] <johnbender> g'damnit this browser is so fucked
[12:52:50] * johnbender is using a lot of foul language today
[12:52:51] <johnbender> sorry
[12:53:20] <Wilto> I am offended!
[12:53:57] <Wilto> uGoMobi_: How goes the battle?
[12:54:31] <johnbender> Wilto: http://butmyopinionisright.tumblr.com/post/31079561065/the-problem-with-the-big-bang-theory
[12:54:42] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: good... it's working
[12:55:06] <Wilto> ‚ÄúChuck Lorre has given us four exceptionally intelligent, nerdy main characters and he‚Äôs positioned us as an audience against them.‚Äù
[12:55:09] <Wilto> Nailed it.
[12:59:29] <Wilto> uGoMobi_: Anything you need me to test?
[13:01:14] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: I think I will be ready in half an hour, then it would be nice if you could test on some iOS and Android 2.x devices
[13:01:23] <Wilto> Sure thing, man.
[13:01:50] <Wilto> johnbender: Got any leads on decent, non-eye-bleed-y Irssi themes?
[13:12:58] <uGoMobi_> Wilto: why do we use -ms-transform and -o-transform in the panel CSS? Opera doesn't pass our transform3d support test and IE only supports it on IE10 (unprefixed)?
[13:14:33] <Wilto> uGoMobi_: ‚Ä¶huh, yeah, good point.
[13:15:00] <Wilto> I think I just wrote ‚Äôem all in and then nixed `webkit`, since there are a bunch of false positives.
[13:16:02] <Wilto> I see no reason not to scratch those out.
[13:21:56] <johnbender> Wilto: nope, I just use the default
[13:22:01] <johnbender> :)
[13:22:18] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/huyz/irssi-colors-solarized
[13:22:58] <Wilto> Oh hell yes.
[13:23:07] <Wilto> ‚ô° me some Solarized.
[13:23:09] <johnbender> Wilto: installation is ... involved lol
[13:23:24] <Wilto> ‚Ä¶huh.

[14:33:00] <toddmparker> for: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380
[14:33:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker: awesome
[14:34:04] <toddmparker> 4956 can be moved out imho. it's now just a demo anyway so we could close and link it to the "add demos" ticket
[14:34:05] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thats it for 1.3 issues then
[14:34:13] <toddmparker> cool
[14:35:42] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: seems like you're moving along on panels?
[14:35:50] <toddmparker> you put up a branch
[14:36:06] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: yes, but I am not completely done yet
[14:36:30] <toddmparker> ok. so how are things looking?
[14:36:33] <uGoMobi_> working on changes to fixed toolbars now (not wrapping them)
[14:36:52] <toddmparker> ah, cool. so you think you can get fixed to work while panels are open?
[14:36:54] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: with that change Chrome on Android works perfect
[14:37:04] <toddmparker> if you need Wilto to do some prelim testing, let us know
[14:38:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker: these are the times its too bad we all live so far apart cant even go out for a beer after a release lol 
[14:38:20] <toddmparker> i know, right?
[14:38:27] <uGoMobi_> beer :P
[14:38:45] <toddmparker> all this work and when we release it's never a fun "press the red button and spray champagne" moment
[14:39:03] <toddmparker> we can do a hangout and drink a beer together. hopefully on monday!
[14:39:22] <uGoMobi_> cool
[14:39:23] <arschmitz> toddmparker:  is fun dunk at a bowling alley too trust me 
[14:39:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi is i mean
[14:39:50] <uGoMobi_> you already drunk arschmitz ? ;)
[14:39:51] <uGoMobi_> lol
[14:40:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: you and gseguin were awesome at drunk bowling
[14:40:28] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: so, yes, I am making fixed toolbars work while panels are transitioing / open
[14:40:45] <uGoMobi_> drunk bowling? I don't recall that ;)
[14:41:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: i honestly wouldnt be suprised ha ha ha
[14:42:31] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: good luck with that. if you figure it out, i owe you a keg
[14:42:54] <uGoMobi_> a keg? can i drink that?
[14:43:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you and a few friends maybe ha ha 
[14:43:34] <toddmparker> if you really try
[14:43:55] <uGoMobi_> thanks though
[14:44:11] <uGoMobi_> not sure until when you guys are at the office
[14:45:02] <uGoMobi_> but will make sure we can test this tomorrow morning
[14:45:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have ios and 2.3 if you need me to test anything
[14:46:05] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: perfect
[14:46:40] <arschmitz> what you need checked?
[14:47:24] <uGoMobi_> if you like you can test the panel page in the docs on branch panel-refactor-part2
[14:48:05] <uGoMobi_> but I didn't finish changes to fixed toolbars yet
[14:48:13] <uGoMobi_> that will make a difference
[14:50:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: looks good on ios 5
[14:50:43] <uGoMobi_> :)
[14:51:02] <arschmitz> is swipe to close suposed to be working?
[14:51:58] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: wilto was working on that
[14:52:14] <uGoMobi_> it was broken and i didn't look at it
[14:52:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: thats right
[14:52:33] <zachleat> are you guys talking about the slide panel?
[14:52:43] <uGoMobi_> zachleat: hi and yes
[14:53:02] <zachleat> swipe to close should've been fixed with the PR arschmitz merged yesterday
[14:53:08] <zachleat> are you seeing it still broken?
[14:53:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ios6 looks GREAT!
[14:53:21] <uGoMobi_> zachleat: on master yes
[14:53:28] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: thanks... good to know!
[14:53:43] <arschmitz> zachleat: it wasent that which broke it it looks like
[14:55:38] <zachleat> let me see if I can conjure wilto
[14:56:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on iphone4 ios5 panel opens are a little jerky (phone / ios a bit slower) but ipad2 ios6 is fantastic
[14:56:20] <Wilto> who done what now
[14:56:25] <Wilto> Yeah; I got something.
[14:56:33] <Wilto> It‚Äôs some weapons-grade nonsense, but it works.
[14:57:11] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: I see the same on Android 4.1 ... I hope that changes to  fixed toolbar improves it
[14:57:37] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: only overlay and push, right? reveal should be ok
[14:58:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[14:59:03] <toddmparker> zachleat: there is a bit more to do on swipe but wilt has a fix he needs to push
[14:59:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: its fine its just not as smooth i think
[14:59:40] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: android webview is far from perfect yet either... strange thing is that it's only with closing a panel and not with opening panel
[14:59:46] <toddmparker> i think animating a fixed positioned element may be chuggy
[14:59:59] <toddmparker> but since this is hw accel, guess it's just a picture?
[15:00:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: weird on ios close its perfect its just open
[15:03:06] <Wilto> INCOMING COMMITS
[15:03:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_:2.3 looks good
[15:03:27] <arschmitz> no transitions there so not suprised lol
[15:03:35] <uGoMobi_> aha
[15:03:37] <uGoMobi_> lol
[15:03:56] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: do we really need to add class -open-complete ?
[15:04:07] <Wilto> stupid commit bot
[15:04:33] <arschmitz> Wilto: i think its github
[15:04:47] <arschmitz> i havent been getting my push hooks fired all afternoon
[15:04:58] <arschmitz> (on my own repos with my own jenkins)
[15:05:14] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/b4564daa00...8c3c0081ec
[15:05:17] <Wilto> I‚Ä¶ I have questions.
[15:06:06] <ryanneufeld> That's normal for a boy your age
[15:06:15] <uGoMobi_> lol
[15:06:18] <arschmitz> ha ha 
[15:06:59] <jlembeck> arschmitz: definitely github, I've been encountering the same thing
[15:07:07] <jlembeck> nothing to jenkins or campfire for a bit now
[15:07:09] <Wilto> ryanneufeld: hey we‚Äôre trying to keep it professional in here bruh you know how I do
[15:07:25] <Wilto> I‚Äôm a little curious about GitHub forgetting my nickname for a commit, but whatever‚Äîcode‚Äôs in there.
[15:07:50] <arschmitz> jlembeck: cool i figured as much since nothing seems to be happening anywhere lol 
[15:07:58] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: you can ammend that commit to fix the author
[15:08:04] <Wilto> ur an author
[15:08:07] <Wilto> BOOM
[15:08:14] <ryanneufeld> Real professional
[15:08:18] <ryanneufeld> right there :p
[15:08:19] <Wilto> so‚Äôs your face
[15:08:20] <Wilto> OHHHH
[15:08:29] <Wilto> Anyway, I‚Äôm gonna go home now.
[15:08:31] <arschmitz> Wilto: 50% ain‚Äôt no opacity I ever heard of. awesome commit
[15:08:31] <ryanneufeld> `osn
[15:08:46] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: asking scott about that
[15:08:54] <Wilto> Again: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/bafa5d95d1ae2f028749c710aa198b96de7eeb3d is some hickory-smoked nonsense, so testing is very warranted.
[15:09:43] <Wilto> Later on, jQuery Mobros.
[15:09:45] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: we don't use it and we fire panelopen event 
[15:09:50] <uGoMobi_> good night Wilto 
[15:10:33] <arschmitz> im heading home too be back later if anyone needs anything ha ha 
[15:13:50] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: word is that is used in the media query to re-flow the page contents after the transition finishes
[15:13:58] <toddmparker> if you can find another way
[15:14:24] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: yeah, sorry, I just saw that
[15:15:18] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: we add .ui-panel-page-block when the transition is complete so i can use that in the MQ
[15:15:32] <toddmparker> that works
[15:15:46] <toddmparker> we need to remember to update the docs page with that MW snippet
