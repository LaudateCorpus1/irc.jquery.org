[04:20:46] <toddmparker_> agcolom: fantastic!
[04:21:01] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: I see that. Anyone know how to edit that?
[04:21:52] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker_ 
[04:21:52] <toddmparker_> fixed.
[04:21:56] <uGoMobi> great
[04:21:58] <toddmparker_> hi uGoMobi 
[04:22:06] <uGoMobi> had a nice birthday party?
[04:22:10] <toddmparker_> how was your weekend
[04:22:20] <toddmparker_> yeah, went out to dinner with friends
[04:22:27] <uGoMobi> oh nice
[04:22:29] <toddmparker_> went skiing for the first time yesterday
[04:22:37] <uGoMobi> yeah weekend was good
[04:22:52] <uGoMobi> really? you have mountains nearby?
[04:23:01] <toddmparker_> well "mountains"
[04:23:18] <toddmparker_> 2,005' (611 m)
[04:23:18] <toddmparker_> Mount Wachusett, Elevation
[04:23:27] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[04:23:29] <toddmparker_> but they have snow and trails
[04:23:34] <uGoMobi> but still nice
[04:23:53] <toddmparker_> good enough for me. i was learning next to 4 year olds
[04:24:05] <uGoMobi> i have only indoor ski posibilities here
[04:24:09] <toddmparker_> yeah, i'ts right near my parents house so i can visit too
[04:24:20] <uGoMobi> ah cool.... had to wear helmet? ;-)
[04:24:21] <toddmparker_> yeah? that flat, huh.
[04:24:27] <toddmparker_> I did!
[04:24:33] <uGoMobi> lol
[04:24:59] <uGoMobi> yeah holland is flat.. have to go to swiss or austria for skiing
[04:25:21] <toddmparker_> but those are amazing places to skii and close by
[04:25:30] <uGoMobi> yes for sure
[04:26:15] <toddmparker_> i need to update the blog post this morning to get everyone's edits in
[04:27:50] <uGoMobi> I only noticed two new options that weren't mentioned... will comment BC
[04:28:01] <toddmparker_> great, thanks
[04:28:08] <uGoMobi> I am still battling with panels
[04:28:15] <uGoMobi> found a new issue
[04:28:52] <toddmparker_> what's that?
[04:29:22] <uGoMobi> when a page with panels is not the initial page and you open a panel first time Android zooms out
[04:29:27] <uGoMobi> and then in again
[04:34:38] <toddmparker_> woah, odd
[04:34:45] <toddmparker_> what versions
[04:35:26] <uGoMobi> at least on 4.1
[04:35:43] <uGoMobi> will test 4.0 on BS
[04:36:27] <uGoMobi> maybe it is because we only add overflow-x hidden for the page when the panel is open
[04:36:57] <toddmparker_> i see
[04:37:07] <toddmparker_> and the panels are there, but offscreen
[04:37:33] <toddmparker_> but how come we didn't see that earlier when testing?
[04:37:41] <toddmparker_> i'd nav in from the homepage
[04:37:55] <uGoMobi> then you see it
[04:38:11] <uGoMobi> maybe it haven't been tested after we added overflow-x hidden
[04:38:46] <uGoMobi> you do get to see the panel
[04:39:03] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! I'm trying to make a jsperf page that includes jQM, but it ends up enhancing the page :) Do we have a way of turning off auto-enhance inside mobileinit?
[04:39:41] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: i'll do some testing this morning when i get in
[04:39:48] <toddmparker_> any ideas on how ot solve it?
[04:39:58] <_|Nix|_> OK. Got it.
[04:39:59] <toddmparker_> what if panels were positions under the page at first
[04:40:05] <toddmparker_> then moved into position
[04:40:08] <uGoMobi> I have ideas, I am testing them now
[04:40:21] <_|Nix|_> Also, you can simply refresh :)
[04:40:28] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[04:41:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: the problem is not when you load the page but when you open the panel
[04:41:53] <uGoMobi> at the moment the panel has to be already in place
[04:43:48] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[04:47:28] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: you always have good ideas
[04:47:42] <toddmparker_> be back in a while
[04:47:48] <uGoMobi> talking about good ideas
[04:48:09] <uGoMobi> found a way to get rid of all blinks without so many hardware accel.
[05:35:36] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: really? awesome
[05:35:47] <toddmparker_> just tell me when you want us to test
[05:36:18] <uGoMobi> yes I will
[05:37:47] <uGoMobi> the whole problem turns out to be redraw of the panel background which we can't prevent
[05:38:17] <uGoMobi> but we can apply background of the panel to the page and set page body class to the wrapper
[05:38:27] <uGoMobi> doesn't work for overlay panel
[05:38:54] <uGoMobi> but that one wasn't that bad anyway with a bit hardware accel.
[05:54:47] <uGoMobi> now I think of it... it's basically the same as what we do with the overlay for page transitions
[06:18:06] <toddmparker_> true
[06:18:31] <toddmparker_> the less hw accel we use, the better but it's needed in places
[06:18:39] <toddmparker_> heading into the office, talk in a bit
[06:54:57] <uGoMobi> yeah, we still need some hw accel
[06:55:46] <uGoMobi> it takes a bit long before the page shows up on iOS4... let's test on real device and see if we need to do some UA sniffing
[07:14:18] <Wilto> who said ua sniffing
[07:20:49] <uGoMobi> I would never say such a thing ... tralala
[07:56:38] <arschmitz> Hi all sorry getting in a bit late this morning had an drs appointment 
[07:57:13] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[07:57:21] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 2 new commits to 06panel-refactor-part2: 02http://git.io/2X_a1g

[07:57:23] <Wilto> arschmitz: YOU’RE FIRED
[07:57:30] <arschmitz> DAMN IT :(
[07:58:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_ Wilto arschmitz : let's do some testing :)
[07:58:39] <Wilto> Sure; what’s up, uGoMobi?
[07:58:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what you need tested?
[07:58:52] <uGoMobi> panels, what else
[07:58:53] <Wilto> Just general-purpose 1.3 testing?
[07:58:56] <Wilto> Naturally.
[07:59:01] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:59:14] <uGoMobi> not sure when branch preview is updated
[07:59:20] <uGoMobi> but we can use arschmitz his tool
[08:00:36] <uGoMobi> http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/panel-refactor-part2/docs/panels/index.html
[08:01:17] <uGoMobi> that one is updated now
[08:04:50] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: so you're ready for a testing pass?
[08:04:58] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes
[08:05:12] <uGoMobi> didn't fix the Android zoom issue yet
[08:05:44] <uGoMobi> but let's see how the changes work out on iOS 4/5/6 and Android 4.0 devices
[08:06:07] <toddmparker> ok
[08:06:14] <uGoMobi> I am afraid iOS will take too long to show the page
[08:06:27] <uGoMobi> but need some hw accel for Android
[08:06:40] <toddmparker> bit.ly/11uIsyd
[08:06:48] <toddmparker> short link
[08:07:28] <toddmparker> capital i after u
[08:08:10] <uGoMobi>  I am afraid iOS will take too long to show the page >> iOS4 I meant
[08:09:07] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: nope, looks great on iOS4 on the iPad 1
[08:09:17] <toddmparker> seems fast enough
[08:09:24] <uGoMobi> seriously? ok cool!
[08:09:48] <toddmparker> yeah, it feels normal
[08:09:58] <toddmparker> iPad is always a tad laggy, this feels solid
[08:10:09] <toddmparker> it's not like it's a 1 sec delay out anything
[08:10:15] <uGoMobi> BS not really reliable for that
[08:10:23] <toddmparker> nope
[08:10:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its so hard to judge speed on browser stack its so slow all the time i feel like
[08:10:49] <toddmparker> kindle fire hd is a go
[08:11:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes I know, but it was like 3 secs delay so I thought there would still be some delay left on real device
[08:12:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: iphone 4 ios5 is the best iv ever seen it
[08:12:52] <arschmitz> reveal is perfect iv never seen reveal perfect on iphone 4 ios5
[08:13:37] <toddmparker> iPad 1 with iOS5 is also great. the overlay panels have the bg artifact the first time you open 'em but everything else is prerfect
[08:13:40] <uGoMobi> sorry I forgot to merge branch master so the swipe fix is still not in there
[08:13:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but now overlay is a bit weird 
[08:14:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: overlay is kinda like reveal was before now
[08:14:09] <uGoMobi> yes overlay first time is the only one that can't be fully fixed
[08:14:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok and yes it is only first time here too
[08:14:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what iOS / iDevice?
[08:14:51] <arschmitz> iphone4 ios5
[08:15:00] <arschmitz> its the same thing toddmparker was talking about
[08:15:36] <uGoMobi> on Android you see the first time the bg isn't filled competely yet when the panel becomes visible
[08:15:54] <uGoMobi> is that the same as what you guys see?
[08:16:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes thats what im seeing
[08:16:21] <uGoMobi> for "push" I fixed this by setting the panel bg on the page
[08:16:54] <uGoMobi> but for overlay this obviously doesn't help because the content wrap stays underneath
[08:17:08] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: are the overlays hw accel?
[08:17:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ios6 ipad 2 is perfect on all modes
[08:17:13] <toddmparker> that may goose it
[08:17:25] <toddmparker> yeah, iPad mini iOS6 is perfect too
[08:17:32] <uGoMobi> yes overlay is hw accelerated
[08:17:36] <toddmparker> so the overlay artifact is iOS5?
[08:17:41] <toddmparker> and some android?
[08:17:46] <toddmparker> looked fine on kindle fire hd
[08:18:10] <uGoMobi> half the times you see it on Android the first time you open overlay
[08:18:20] <uGoMobi> and it's not the whole bg
[08:18:49] <uGoMobi> just a small part at the edge that isn't filled yet
[08:18:58] <uGoMobi> that is on Galaxy Nexus
[08:19:20] <uGoMobi> might be bit worse on less powerful devices
[08:21:25] <uGoMobi> but I think 1Gb is pretty common for 4.0/4.1 devices
[08:21:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think so too but all i have is a galaxy nexus also
[08:24:15] <toddmparker> just tested the nexus 7 on 4.1 and it's buttery smooth. i see a small flash of a black bar on the right when i close reveal and push left but it's really minor
[08:24:52] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that could be the shadow we add
[08:25:04] <uGoMobi> well not for push
[08:25:21] <toddmparker> it's maybe 40-50px wide, most of the content right on the right
[08:25:35] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[08:25:43] <toddmparker> so far, this looks way better than master
[08:26:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on ios5 it seems like its a give and take before reveal was same as overlay is now 
[08:26:40] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: one thing I noticed is that push and reveal don't re-flow on wider screens
[08:26:54] <toddmparker> so did you remove that class or do the styles in the media query need adjusting?
[08:27:03] <uGoMobi> hey you are right
[08:27:10] <uGoMobi> let me check
[08:27:34] <toddmparker> looks perfect in ios6 on iphone5
[08:28:07] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: setting overflow-x hidden for the page fixes Android zoom issue
[08:28:48] <uGoMobi> the problem with overflow-x hidden with FF is no longer there because I changed the panel positioning logic
[08:29:20] <uGoMobi> so that will be fixed soon too
[08:30:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nice! creaping ever closer on this
[08:33:35] <toddmparker> col
[08:33:39] <toddmparker> cool :)
[08:33:51] <toddmparker> panels are just as hard as page transitions
[08:34:09] <toddmparker> took 4 full re-factors to get this done
[08:34:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: in essense they are very similar
[08:35:14] <arschmitz> execpt a few less timing issues with panels lol

[08:39:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the ability to update branch previews instantly can be handy for testing huh?
[08:39:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah it's great!
[08:40:35] <arschmitz> i really like being able to go in and run unit tests easily from a menu too 
[08:43:50] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yep, reflows now
[08:44:36] <toddmparker> charging my 4.0 and 4.1 phones
[08:46:20] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: woah, i see that android zoom problem. 
[08:46:35] <uGoMobi> yeah it's bad
[08:46:53] <toddmparker> on my 4.0 phone, reveal is smoother than overlay
[08:47:01] <toddmparker> impressive
[08:47:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think it is on ios5 also
[08:47:31] <uGoMobi> yes we have to change text in docs that overlay is best one to use
[08:48:04] <toddmparker> think reveal is?
[08:48:40] <uGoMobi> yes, for reveal I used different approach so I could remove all transitions from the panel
[08:49:01] <uGoMobi> and I think reveal is most popular
[08:49:08] <uGoMobi> so that's a good thing
[08:49:27] <toddmparker> cool. we can change the default
[08:49:37] <uGoMobi> good idea
[08:49:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think what ever looks best should be default so +1 for reveal
[08:49:53] <uGoMobi> finishing Android zoom issue fix now
[08:49:55] <toddmparker> yep
[08:50:17] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: so what's you idea for fixing this android zoom thing?
[08:50:38] <uGoMobi> overflow-x hidden for pages with panels
[08:50:57] <toddmparker> ok
[08:50:57] <uGoMobi> not only when panel is open but on init
[08:51:09] <toddmparker> that ok for ff?
[08:51:09] <uGoMobi> but have to test page transitions
[08:51:21] <uGoMobi> yes works on FF
[08:51:29] <toddmparker> ok. great
[08:51:38] <toddmparker> i think once that is in, we can land this in master
[08:51:43] <toddmparker> seems way better
[08:51:44] <uGoMobi> because we use translate now to position the panel off the screen
[08:52:13] <uGoMobi> yes I think this is the best we can do
[08:52:31] <uGoMobi> explored every approach
[08:53:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe you can take a look at the code I added to get the page theme
[08:53:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure got a link?
[08:53:51] <uGoMobi> I used jqmData but that only works when you set data-theme for on the page div
[08:54:25] <uGoMobi> so I added fallback to "c" if no data-theme was set
[08:54:48] <uGoMobi> that works but maybe there is a better way of doing this
[08:54:58] <arschmitz> ok
[08:55:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/panel-refactor-part2/js/widgets/panel.js#L53
[08:56:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks!
[08:56:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem looking at it right now
[08:56:36] <uGoMobi> cool
[08:56:57] <uGoMobi> would be better if the hardcoded fallback is only in page.js
[08:58:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats kinda what im thinking
[08:58:37] <arschmitz> im going to look at page real quick im thinking if we are setting a fall back already why not actually SET it lol
[08:59:30] <arschmitz> ahh ok uGoMobi: we can do it already
[08:59:54] <uGoMobi> yes we do that in page.js
[09:00:31] <uGoMobi> but if the fallback is used is there anyway to grab it
[09:01:06] <arschmitz> yes there is just one half sec
[09:01:18] <uGoMobi> and now I think about it... will my code work correctly if you set the page theme dynamically 
[09:01:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have achieved /very/ modest performance gains by using native + clone: http://jsperf.com/popup-creation ... can you maybe go over the test or http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/popup.js when you have a sec? The latter is a stripped-down version of jQM with everything that's necessary to not error out when enhancing a popup, and two copies of the popup widget: popup and popup2, which enhances things the supposedly fast
[09:01:36] <uGoMobi> or when you configure the default before init
[09:02:47] <arschmitz> var $theme = $.data( self._page, "mobilepage").options.theme;
[09:02:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ^^
[09:03:17] <uGoMobi> perfect
[09:04:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome and yes clone is always going to be faster then creating so defining things that get reused is a good idea for sure
[09:05:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but, unfortunately, it may not be worth the extra code. If the performance gain is only, like, 2-3% ... *shrug* ...
[09:06:19] <arschmitz> yeah its tough
[09:06:39] <arschmitz> one thing we can take away for sure though is not to create elements with $("...")
[09:06:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you committing that change or want me to do it?
[09:06:55] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06panel-refactor-part2: 02http://git.io/zBIuSA

[09:07:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what ever you want
[09:07:28] <uGoMobi> ok I'll make the change
[09:08:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have one more trick up my sleeve. I'm still adding the elements to the DOM using jQuery. I'll do another run with appendChild ...
[09:08:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: 2- 3% really isnt too bad either when you think big picture
[09:09:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: as long as we are not adding too much code i still call that a win
[09:09:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright. That's fair.
[09:10:50] <toddmparker> so zoom is set?
[09:11:21] <toddmparker> looks like arschmitz's server isn't updated quite yet
[09:11:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker: there is a button that needs top be hit to update it dosent do it automaticly
[09:12:07] <arschmitz> toddmparker: its updated now
[09:12:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: var $theme = $.data( $page, "mobilepage" ).options.theme doesn't work
[09:13:21] <uGoMobi> $.data( $page, "mobilepage" ) is undefined
[09:13:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just a sec let me actually pull a local copy 
[09:15:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok thanks
[09:15:34] <arschmitz> for some reason the page widget data dosent seem to be on the page it self need to figure out why
[09:18:45] <arschmitz> ahh ok sorry i see
[09:20:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: 2 problems
[09:20:33] <arschmitz> you are setting $theme before you set _page
[09:21:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: never mind that last comment read too quick
[09:22:24] <arschmitz> var $theme = $.data( self._page[0], "mobilepage").options.theme;
[09:22:46] <arschmitz> i forgot $.data will only accept a dom node not a jquery object

[09:23:18] <uGoMobi> aha
[09:23:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: feel free to commit :)
[09:23:34] <arschmitz> ok
[09:23:57] <uGoMobi> ah I also have to update destroy
[09:25:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill update and push right this moment
[09:25:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: perfect, thanks again
[09:26:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem at all
[09:27:07] <arschmitz> this will account for dynamicly set themese like you were worried about too 
[09:29:18] <toddmparker> re-testing...

[09:30:31] <toddmparker> zoom is looking good on 4.0 a.k.a "worst case scenario"
[09:30:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: let me know when your done making changes i just noticed a big jQuery style guide no no in there lol
[09:30:37] <toddmparker> reveal is by far the best there
[09:30:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: tell me
[09:31:05] <uGoMobi> I am not making changes now
[09:31:07] <arschmitz> never set an object property by expando
[09:31:18] <arschmitz> always use extend
[09:32:28] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:32:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not really a big deal but can cause some issues in some really really edge case and one of those picky style things
[09:33:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah we have to follow the guide
[09:33:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup exactly
[09:33:54] <toddmparker> any re-test this on android web views?
[09:34:02] <toddmparker> and iOS web views?
[09:34:03] <uGoMobi> I did
[09:34:09] <toddmparker> 4.1 looks perfect
[09:34:12] <uGoMobi> android webviews
[09:34:55] <uGoMobi> performance isnt great on android webview
[09:34:59] <toddmparker> arschmitz: you have your little jsbin iOS tester
[09:35:04] <uGoMobi> but it is very acceptable
[09:35:11] <toddmparker> on 4.1 too?
[09:35:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah just a sec
[09:35:28] <uGoMobi> yes webview on 4.1
[09:35:53] <uGoMobi> I think if you turn on hw accel in your app it will be better
[09:35:59] <toddmparker> hmm, well you can only polish that turd so much
[09:36:14] <toddmparker> k, as long as it doesn't seem glitchy
[09:36:17] <toddmparker> we're good
[09:37:05] <uGoMobi> no it isn't glitchy
[09:37:13] <uGoMobi> no blinks or redraws
[09:37:28] <uGoMobi> just a little bit less smooth
[09:38:01] <toddmparker> good!
[09:38:40] <uGoMobi> and fixed toolbars don't transition, but that will probably be fixed if you turn on hw accel
[09:38:42] <arschmitz> ios webviews are identical to regualr page 
[09:38:51] <toddmparker> chrome is a bit lagger than the default browser on android. interesting.
[09:38:58] <arschmitz> on ios5 and ios6
[09:39:20] <uGoMobi> and I will add CSS to docs how to hide fixed toolbars during tranition
[09:41:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I didn't see much difference between Chrome and stock browser on 4.1
[09:41:47] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: cool
[09:41:58] <toddmparker> think we should add fixed to that panel button way down the page
[09:42:32] <toddmparker> chrome is slow to start the transition. it sits for ~1 second but is smooth once going
[09:42:41] <toddmparker> 1-2 seconds
[09:42:46] <toddmparker> on 4.0
[09:42:55] <uGoMobi> actually the whole trick with the bg was only needed for absolute... fixed didn't have the redraw problem
[09:42:55] <toddmparker> but it's known for now being fast
[09:45:00] <toddmparker> opera mobile on android seems to work ok. small style things but not worth sweating
[09:46:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: when you nav with a slide transition to a page with panel you notice some of the 3D-ing kicking in... not all page content is visible
[09:49:00] <uGoMobi> that is... not visible yet, you can see it is getting redrawed during the transition
[09:51:19] <toddmparker> complicated business
[09:51:29] <uGoMobi> it sure is
[09:51:50] <toddmparker> i think we're just going to have to urn some of this out post beta. hear what are the biggest issues and make tweaks
[09:52:13] <toddmparker> this checks out in iOS 4,5,6. Android 2.3, 4.0, 4.1. WP7.5
[09:52:34] <toddmparker> so i think it's an improvement over master for sure
[09:54:43] <uGoMobi> I agree
[09:55:12] <toddmparker> i say lock and load
[09:55:20] <toddmparker> when you're ready
[09:55:27] <uGoMobi> I have to add some code to the destroy method and finish updating the docs
[09:56:05] <uGoMobi> and I change the default to reveal
[09:56:23] <johnbender> toddmparker: what's the plan
[09:56:30] <johnbender> toddmparker: do you want me to cut the beta?
[10:02:19] <toddmparker> johnbender: good timing
[10:02:30] <johnbender> toddmparker: :)
[10:02:33] <toddmparker> we just finished doing some testing on uGoMobi's re-re-factor
[10:02:46] <toddmparker> he is going to merge that into master soon
[10:02:51] <toddmparker> after that, we can cut the beta
[10:02:56] <johnbender> toddmparker: I have a meeting in about 30 minutes but I can handle it while I"m on the call
[10:02:59] <johnbender> just ping me
[10:03:06] <johnbender> s/"/'/
[10:03:14] <toddmparker> anyone have other changes that would hold up the beta? speak now...
[10:03:16] <toddmparker> ok, johnbender 
[10:06:49] <arschmitz> toddmparker: anything i can think of can be handled post beta so good as far as i know
[10:08:12] <toddmparker> arschmitz: cool, think so too
[10:10:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker: im pushing updates for swipe in docs right now
[10:11:14] <arschmitz> toddmparker: if you want to take a quick look to make sure i didnt butcher it too bad lol

[10:12:58] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14b671eaf 15Alexander Schmitz: Docs: update swipe event documentation to include extensibility and warning about iOS.
[10:13:36] <arschmitz> toddmparker: rangeslider is in the api docs now too agcolom added it this weekend there are a few minor things to fix she said she would catch up with me today about anything on it.
[10:23:35] <agcolom> arschmitz: toddmparker  hello :-)
[10:23:55] <arschmitz> agcolom: Hi
[10:24:25] <arschmitz> agcolom: i only had 2 things i noticed on rangeslider api docs
[10:24:35] <agcolom> yes ?
[10:24:45] <arschmitz> the very last demo is using jqm 1.2 so its not working lol
[10:24:54] <agcolom> oh sorry ;-)
[10:25:10] <agcolom> that's easy to fix :-)
[10:25:13] <arschmitz> and the events. the only events rangeslider has are create and normalize
[10:25:31] <agcolom> ok... easy to fix as well :-)
[10:25:38] <arschmitz> but you may want to note that the individual sliders still emit all of their own events like normal
[10:26:02] <agcolom> oh I see...
[10:27:18] <arschmitz> normalize is triggered when we "normalize" the input values (generally happens when you try to drag one handle past the other)
[10:28:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: ^^ does that make sense
[10:28:30] <agcolom> yes :-)
[10:28:33] <arschmitz> ok cool
[10:28:48] <arschmitz> agcolom: i also updated swipe in the normal docs
[10:29:17] <agcolom> I'll try this evening if I have a chance, but I have to prepare dinner first and help with homework...
[10:29:21] <arschmitz> agcolom: i thought that would be easiest since i havent really worked with the api docs yet
[10:29:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: no problem i just wanted to let you know
[10:31:18] <agcolom> thank you :-)
[10:48:25] <toddmparker> hi agcolom 
[10:48:55] <toddmparker> uGoMobi is making a few small panel changes that we'll need to remember to update in the api docs
[10:49:08] <toddmparker> seems like reveal is going to be smoothest so that is the new default
[10:51:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi! I am updating the old docs now so you can use that as source
[10:55:20] <uGoMobi> Wilto: are you around?
[10:58:26] <Wilto> WHO SUMMONS WILTO
[10:58:31] <Wilto> oh uGoMobi does whatup
[10:59:46] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I was wondering if browsers that don't support position fixed will fallback to absolute with current css for panels
[11:00:01] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/panel-refactor-part2/css/structure/jquery.mobile.panel.css#L3
[11:00:15] <uGoMobi> with current I meant in the refactor branch
[11:01:23] <uGoMobi> we only add the class for fixed positioning if the option is set to true or when panel contents is bigger than viewport
[11:01:27] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/panel-refactor-part2/js/widgets/panel.js#L154
[11:02:17] <uGoMobi> was just wondering if it would fallback to position absolute which we set for .ui-panel
[11:12:55] <Wilto> Hey, sorry uGoMobi.
[11:13:33] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Nosir. Fixed is gonna fall back to `position: static`.
[11:13:48] <uGoMobi> that's what I thought
[11:13:59] <uGoMobi> :(
[11:14:24] <Wilto> Did I ever move out the fixed blacklist to `support`?
[11:14:28] <Wilto> We should use that same approach here.
[11:14:38] <uGoMobi> lemme check
[11:15:43] <uGoMobi> Wilto: no I don't see it in support.js
[11:16:47] <uGoMobi> so we should move that from fixedToolbar to support
[11:17:26] <agcolom> toddmparker: uGoMobi sure will have a look soon :-) (about to have dinner.... )
[11:21:11] <johnbender> uGoMobi: we have two "test-tags" do we need those?
[11:21:41] <uGoMobi> johnbender: test-tags?
[11:23:16] <uGoMobi> not sure what you mean
[11:34:49] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and Wilto - thought we had qualified fixed here
[11:38:59] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: on master fixed was only set if cssTransform3d is true
[11:39:28] <uGoMobi> that probably rules out the browsers that don't support fixed
[11:48:27] <toddmparker> think we were using that as a rough diagnostic
[11:53:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: there are two tags under tags on github 
[11:53:12] <johnbender> uGoMobi: there at the top
[11:53:20] <johnbender> the commits are yours it looks like
[11:54:39] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ah ok I see what you mean now
[11:54:54] <uGoMobi> johnbender: the last commit was mine but I didn't tag
[11:55:11] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I think it might have been gseguin who did that
[11:56:22] <johnbender> gseguin|away: test-tags?
[11:56:31] <uGoMobi> maybe something to do with the download builder?
[11:56:36] <johnbender> gseguin|away: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tags
[11:56:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: seems likely
[12:09:46] <agcolom> when are we moving to 1.3 (beta?) (to know when I should update the api docs examples)
[12:10:05] <arschmitz> agcolom: this afternoon probably
[12:10:17] <agcolom> arschmitz: cool! thanks
[12:10:50] <arschmitz> agcolom: no problem
[12:11:17] <agcolom> arschmitz: regarding the rangeslider events
[12:11:32] <agcolom> I do not currently have normalize... what is it?
[12:12:17] <arschmitz> agcolom: normalize is triggered when we "normalize" the input values (generally happens when you try to drag one handle past the other)
[12:12:23] <agcolom> (Am i right in thinking that I need to remove start and stop and add normalize?)
[12:12:44] <arschmitz> agcolom: yes it should have just create and normalize
[12:13:01] <agcolom> ok.
[12:13:46] <arschmitz> agcolom: we should probably have a note that the 2 sliders that make up the range slider still emit all their normal events
[12:14:50] <agcolom> yes
[12:16:40] <johnbender> uGoMobi: toddmparker: heading out for a run, ETA?
[12:17:52] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Wilto : what shall we do with position fixed support check?

[12:25:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the panel unit test doesn't work because $pageThemeClass is not defined
[12:26:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: looking
[12:26:49] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: did you look at how it's qualified in master now?
[12:27:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes
[12:27:11] <toddmparker> is it just 3D
[12:27:19] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:27:22] <toddmparker> i thought we did a bit more
[12:27:24] <toddmparker> ok then
[12:28:12] <toddmparker> oh, and whether the panel is taller than the viewport
[12:28:23] <toddmparker> because then you can't scroll to access the rest of the menu
[12:28:29] <uGoMobi> I rewrote that code
[12:28:38] <uGoMobi> it wasn't working
[12:28:41] <toddmparker> as long as that concept is still there
[12:28:46] <uGoMobi> it is
[12:28:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: pushing fix right now 
[12:28:48] <toddmparker> right, i remember you mentioned that.
[12:29:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks
[12:29:43] <uGoMobi> but I removed the check for cssTransform3d support before applying fixed
[12:30:34] <toddmparker> I think as long as we have a good demo/test page to keep an eye on the fixed header/panel interactions, we'll be good
[12:32:04] <uGoMobi> but if you set fixed to true I the page will break on a browser that doens't support position fixed
[12:32:44] <uGoMobi> I can put the cssTransform3d back

[12:33:18] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: might be safer, yes
[12:33:20] <uGoMobi> but maybe it's not much work to move the position fixed test from fixedToolbar to support
[12:33:26] <gseguin> johnbender: you can remove that tag
[12:33:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ^^ sorry about that accidently deleted an extra line when i made that change earlier.
[12:34:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: np
[12:35:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats why its bad to do an edit right on github lol. I was so busy this weekend i havent finished setting up my new laptop enough to work on yet :(
[12:36:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I can imagine... takes me a week to set up a system

[12:58:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: will commit cssTransform3d check now for position fixed as temporary solution
[12:59:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: quick alternative is just copy all position fixed support test code from fixedToolbar
[13:00:19] <uGoMobi> then we have the same code at two places until we move it to support.js
[13:01:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats been on my todo list already for a while its already in fixedtoolbar and workarounds this will be a 3rd place
[13:01:38] <uGoMobi> aii :(
[13:02:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what shall we do/
[13:02:08] <uGoMobi> ?

[13:16:07] <uGoMobi> will trigger a build
[13:16:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sweet
[13:16:17] <arschmitz> not sure why mine didnt
[13:16:31] <toddmparker> toolbar don't seem fixed anymore
[13:16:40] <uGoMobi> I dont see it local so i am pretty sure it's because of the missing comma
[13:16:47] <toddmparker> ah
[13:16:49] <arschmitz> its only on panels too
[13:16:57] <arschmitz> fixed toolbar pages are fie
[13:16:59] <arschmitz> fine
[13:17:26] <agcolom> toddmparker: yes the gap at the top
[13:19:23] <uGoMobi> hmm just checked local and there seems to be an issue
[13:19:28] <uGoMobi> looking into it
[13:21:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for the fixed support your just looking to move out the support black list right?
[13:22:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[13:22:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i see one small potential issue
[13:22:49] <arschmitz> right now support black list is an option
[13:22:58] <uGoMobi> aha
[13:23:18] <arschmitz> but i guess if just document that its been depreciated and to set it on mobile.support instead???
[13:23:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker: you around?
[13:23:33] <uGoMobi> we can add a variable which returns the result of the test
[13:23:55] <uGoMobi> and use that variable as value for the option
[13:24:09] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:24:19] <arschmitz> thats will be fine
[13:24:29] <arschmitz> ok ill move it out right now
[13:24:30] <uGoMobi> BTW - there was no issue, the comma will fix the issue we see on master
[13:24:37] <arschmitz> cool
[13:26:02] <Wilto> What are the haps?
[13:29:25] <Wilto> How we lookin’ on testing?
[13:30:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Wilto: im moving the supportblacklist out of fixed to support right now
[13:30:33] <Wilto> Oh, awesome.
[13:30:43] <Wilto> Man, maybe that was in a branch that got nuked… I could swear I moved that.
[13:31:10] <arschmitz> Wilto: not sure i know its been like that since i started working on fixedtoolbars at 1.2
[13:34:30] <Wilto> johnbender: You around? This ring any bells?
[13:34:52] <Wilto> I’m just worried there was a reason it never landed, not that the code got lost in the shuffle somewhere.

[13:42:28] <johnbender> I made mention of that at one point
[13:42:36] <johnbender> don't think we made a branch out of it

[13:44:58] <Wilto> That rings a bell; maybe I nixed it before landing it anywhere.
[13:45:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its moved out i didnt change panel though
[13:46:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: fixedtoolbar and support are updated though
[13:46:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: shoudln't $.support.fixedPositionBlacklist be $.support.fixedPosition
[13:46:30] <uGoMobi> ?
[13:46:44] <uGoMobi> what does it return? if a browser is on the blacklist?
[13:46:54] <uGoMobi> or if fixed position is supported?
[13:46:56] <arschmitz> no because its a blacklist it returns false if fixed position is supported
[13:47:03] <uGoMobi> aha
[13:47:05] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[13:47:24] <arschmitz> i wanted to do it the other way but to maintain backcompat i thought i should leave it
[13:47:48] <uGoMobi> i understand
[13:47:57] <uGoMobi> good thinking :)
[13:48:03] <uGoMobi> I will update panel
[13:48:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: will technically i could just return !$.support.fixedpositionblacklist
[13:48:13] <uGoMobi> still no new build BTW
[13:48:40] <arschmitz> post commit hooks must be down on github no projects have triggered new builds
[13:48:46] <uGoMobi> well I think that makes it more confusing
[13:49:04] <Wilto> Yeah, GitHub has been kinda flaky about service hooks.
[13:49:10] <uGoMobi> it's just that support and blacklist are a bit confusing together
[13:49:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi i mean rename to $.support.fixedPosition 
[13:49:20] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[13:49:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: then in fixedtoolbar have supportblacklist return !$.support.positionFixed ?

[13:49:52] <arschmitz> that will maintain back compat 
[13:49:53] <uGoMobi> wtf
[13:51:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: another lint issue
[13:51:10] <arschmitz> using self and never defining it in destroy
[13:51:25] <arschmitz> ill push a fix right now
[13:51:44] <uGoMobi> pfff... it has been a long day
[13:51:54] <uGoMobi> I probably copy pasted :/
[13:51:55] <arschmitz> its all good just need to switch to this 
[13:51:57] <uGoMobi> thanks
[13:52:21] <arschmitz> so do you think i should switch to $.support.positionFixed too?
[13:52:48] <arschmitz> i think your right that a blacklist on support dosent make sense
[13:53:09] <uGoMobi> will the option still work the same?
[13:53:17] <uGoMobi> then we can change it
[13:54:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you chang self to this in destroy? or define it?
[13:54:16] <arschmitz> change there is no need for self
[13:54:23] <uGoMobi> right
[13:54:25] <arschmitz> and yes option will work the same
[13:54:37] <uGoMobi> that's what I did so far too
[13:54:49] <uGoMobi> just not with last ones ;)
[13:55:04] <arschmitz> :) yeah i got it ill push it in a sec with name change for test
[13:55:40] <uGoMobi> so in panel I can use $.support.positionFixed and it will return true if not on the blacklist?

[14:04:28] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:05:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: just saw the comment... will check it
[14:05:36] <toddmparker> ok, thanks!
[14:05:59] <arschmitz> agcolom: it should be ok when build finished i did last commit and its ok local
[14:06:32] <agcolom> arschmitz: perfect! Thanks...
[14:06:55] <arschmitz> agcolom its building right now so any minute
[14:07:10] <agcolom> When it's all ok, then I'll finish making the final changes for panels on the api docs...
[14:08:04] <uGoMobi> ok we do have an issue
[14:08:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:?
[14:08:26] <uGoMobi> don't see it local
[14:08:58] <uGoMobi> we look for fixed toolbars by finding ui-header-fixed ui-footer-fixed class
[14:09:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the bar being low
[14:09:07] <arschmitz> ?
[14:09:12] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:09:22] <arschmitz> i think its fixed because i dont see it local
[14:09:36] <agcolom> the bar has come back and yes it is low
[14:09:38] <uGoMobi> has to do with difference in order
[14:09:48] <uGoMobi> same as with getInheritedTheme
[14:09:58] <uGoMobi> that also works local but not in the build
[14:10:01] <arschmitz> ohhh ok
[14:10:05] <toddmparker> arg
[14:10:19] <uGoMobi> we can check for data instead of class
[14:10:34] <agcolom> the strange thing is there is a difference between FF and Safari
[14:10:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: checking data is much faster so thats good
[14:10:42] <toddmparker> good idea
[14:10:58] <agcolom> the icons are above the header bar in FF, but in hte header bar in Safari
[14:11:01] <uGoMobi> making the changes
[14:11:31] <arschmitz> push-state-disabled tests timed out

[14:46:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I cannot reproduce the multipage issue
[14:50:34] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: whew
[14:50:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I didn't include how-to hide fixed toolbars on Android WebView with custom CSS in the docs yet
[14:50:50] <toddmparker> ah, ok. 
[14:51:13] <uGoMobi> when I tested my CSS I realized I have to update the solution now the page background is altered
[14:51:13] <toddmparker> otherwise, we good?
[14:51:48] <uGoMobi> simple to hide the toolbars but the page padding gap is bit more tricky
[14:52:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes, everything looks good to go
[14:52:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I also just noted we didn't documented the events yet (only create)
[14:52:49] <toddmparker> right. what do we have now?
[14:52:56] <toddmparker> just tested, looks great
[14:53:26] <uGoMobi> we need to add 4 events: (before)open/close
[14:55:18] <toddmparker> ok
[15:17:35] <toddmparker> guess I need to get the blog post ready
[15:17:54] <johnbender> toddmparker: do you wnat me to tag / deploy or are we still waiting  on commuts
[15:17:57] <johnbender> *commit
[15:18:06] <johnbender> toddmparker: ps I thought of a demo we can do for the nav stuff
[15:18:11] <johnbender> just an extension of the code sample
[15:18:30] <johnbender> instead of console log, it'll add the text to something on the page
[15:18:32] <toddmparker> I think uGoMobi is updating the panel docs
[15:18:36] <johnbender> toddmparker: kk
[15:18:44] <toddmparker> johnbender: cool
[15:19:04] <toddmparker> but otherwise, we're good to go
[15:19:15] <johnbender> toddmparker: great
[15:19:27] <toddmparker> these damn panels
[15:22:20] <uGoMobi> sorry was having a quick late night dinner
[15:22:31] <uGoMobi> I can add the events to the docs now
[15:22:50] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you gotta eat!
[15:23:00] <uGoMobi> I just did :)
[15:23:09] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: other than those events, we're good to go I think -- right?
[15:23:22] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:23:29] <toddmparker> cool
[15:23:40] <uGoMobi> do we document as panelbeforeopen etc. or as beforeopen ?
[15:23:48] <toddmparker> johnbender: if you do a build tonight, i may get the site ready and push it first thing in the morning
[15:23:54] <johnbender> toddmparker: cool
[15:23:57] <toddmparker> sound like a plan?
[15:24:00] <johnbender> toddmparker: it's ready to go, just let me know
[15:24:12] <johnbender> toddmparker: do you want me to do a build now so you can verify the links/
[15:24:15] <johnbender> ?
[15:24:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: just commented on BC re: blog post
[15:24:35] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: saw that, thanks
[15:24:51] <toddmparker> btw - jeff (jlembeck) is cranking on change logs for 1.1.2 and 1.2.1
[15:24:55] <toddmparker> and 1.3.0
[15:24:59] <uGoMobi> great
[15:25:17] <toddmparker> so if we want to push our rc's for these maintenance releases later this week, we can
[15:25:47] <toddmparker> figure we can do an rc, then final a week after if no issues. keep the maintenance releases lower key. seem ok?
