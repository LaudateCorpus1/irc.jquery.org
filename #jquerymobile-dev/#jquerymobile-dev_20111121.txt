[07:07:55] <Wilto> Ghost town in here this morning.
[07:29:30] <toddmparker_> bands don't play not more
[07:29:49] <toddmparker_> too much fighting on the dance floor
[07:44:15] <Wilto> Don’t think I won’t bust out a trumpet and put on my checkerboard fedora.
[07:57:02] <toddmparker_> SKA DAY
[07:57:16] <toddmparker_> any other rude boys here?
[07:57:38] <toddmparker_> I've seen a few Android issues fly by related to fixed toolbars breaking form elements inside.
[07:57:57] <toddmparker_> i think the days of these dynamic positioned bars are numbered
[08:05:24] <Wilto> …Do we want to fix the bugs we’ve got kicking around in there now? I almost feel like it’s revamp time.
[08:06:14] <Wilto> I want to try to figure out binary support for the fixed toolbars. It either works as expected, or they’re static.
[08:07:28] <Wilto> Even if we end up re-applying some of the hackier methods after the fact, it’ll be good to have that established baseline, y’know?
[08:14:39] <Wilto> Actually, I’m tuning-in late to this discussion, looks like.
[08:41:18] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:05:06] <Wilto> Sup, gseguin.
[09:05:36] <gseguin> not much, how was your weekend?
[09:08:57] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[09:09:13] <toddmparker_> kinblas: you around too?
[09:09:37] <kinblas> toddmparker_: unfortunately yeah ... not partaking in pre-holiday cheer just yet :-)
[09:09:45] <toddmparker_> bah humbug
[09:09:52] <kinblas> office is sort of empty
[09:09:54] <toddmparker_> i'm here til wednesday
[09:09:58] <kinblas> ditto
[09:10:10] <toddmparker_> lazy corporate types...
[09:10:12] <gseguin> same here but will be on jQM only on Wed
[09:10:27] <toddmparker_> cool gseguin
[09:10:33] <toddmparker_> i won't bother you then
[09:10:59] <toddmparker_> is johnbender going to be in this week?
[09:13:06] <gseguin> toddmparker_: so is everything alright with the 1.0 bits on the CDN now?
[09:13:19] <gseguin> or are we rushing for a 1.0.1?
[09:14:00] <toddmparker_> i think we're pretty good gseguin
[09:14:28] <toddmparker_> the busted collapsibles and broken images on the docs were the things that were killing me but both are fixed
[09:14:52] <toddmparker_> i want to figure out a course of action for the docs in the zip today, that is still and issue
[09:14:57] <gseguin> ok cool
[09:15:30] <toddmparker_> since links are ajax-based, you get an error on some browsers if you just open the file (not on a web server)
[09:15:37] <toddmparker_> which is a common use case
[09:16:32] <gseguin> yeah, not much we can do there, is there?
[09:16:38] <toddmparker_> i was suggesting just adding a message above the footer explaining this and linking to a wiki page with info on how to open in a server and what browsers will support ajax in file urls
[09:17:13] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge had a pull to disable ajax,but i think that's more confusing, even if it will work
[09:17:31] <toddmparker_> i think messaging is a better idea, but looking for opinions here
[09:19:51] <gseguin> There may be a browser startup option to disable the security check
[09:19:56] * gseguin looks
[09:20:41] <toddmparker_> think there is for chrome
[09:20:54] <toddmparker_> but is it something we can do in our docs?
[09:21:33] <gseguin> I don't think so
[09:21:51] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3113
[09:21:52] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3113 on jquery-mobile, reported by eddiemonge (2d, 14h ago): Docs without a Server don't work (Chrome)
[09:21:59] <toddmparker_> to get everyone caught up
[09:22:17] <johnbender> reading now
[09:24:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it sounds like we need to sort something else out
[09:24:43] <johnbender> that is, the docs as a zip sort of don't work
[09:28:45] <toddmparker_> well, yeah johnbender
[09:29:00] <toddmparker_> well, they do sometimes
[09:29:37] <toddmparker_> some browsers will open the pages and allow for ajax nav if you double-click the index.html page
[09:29:40] <toddmparker_> others, not so much
[09:30:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I was looking at the markup and it might be worth pulling the data out in an external format
[09:30:52] <toddmparker_> whatcha mean?
[09:31:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the markp is well structured so we can probably extract the information
[09:32:33] <gseguin> starting Chrome with --allow-file-access-from-files is an option
[09:32:34] <johnbender> although the fact that many interelated things are siblings will make it a bit more complex I think we can probably build something to pull the information out
[09:32:42] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ping
[09:33:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: once that's done we could provide search too
[09:33:44] <johnbender> as long as we relate the data to a given page
[09:37:18] <toddmparker_> kinblas: pong
[09:37:28] <toddmparker_> johnbender: sounds interesting
[09:37:34] <toddmparker_> search would be killer
[09:37:49] <toddmparker_> so my question for today is how do we make this less broken?
[09:37:49] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I was going to talk to you about 3130, but I'm putting it in the issue
[09:38:03] <toddmparker_> cool, thanks kinblas
[09:38:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: it might take a bit but I'm for pulling the information out
[09:38:44] <johnbender> actually
[09:38:46] <gseguin> toddmparker_: did you see the startup flag: --allow-file-access-from-files is an option
[09:39:00] <toddmparker_> i saw eddie mentioned that
[09:39:00] <gseguin> s/is an options//
[09:39:05] <gseguin> oh ok
[09:39:15] <toddmparker_> is that something we can add to our pages or is a user pref thing?
[09:39:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: cmd line
[09:39:28] <gseguin> it
[09:39:35] <gseguin> it's a geek option
[09:39:53] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[09:40:08] <gseguin> can't use gui to set it (as far as I know)
[09:40:25] <toddmparker_> how can we get n00bs from being confused when they download the zip, open index.html, click and link and see an ajax error message
[09:40:51] <toddmparker_> and have it be not a lot or work (for now)
[09:41:12] <toddmparker_> i'd love to re-do the docs after this. we dont' even use includes for the nav. so sad.
[09:41:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we could package a webserver?
[09:41:39] <johnbender> I don't even know what that would look like though
[09:42:05] <toddmparker_> sheesh. probably not worth the hassle.
[09:42:16] <toddmparker_> gseguin: can you answer this guy? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3123#issuecomment-2818256
[09:42:17] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3123 on jquery-mobile, reported by alexavrutin (18h, 37m ago): JavaScript files linked on the AJAX-loaded pages are requested with timestamp -- not good for caching
[09:42:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: is it important they be in html form?
[09:42:47] <johnbender> we can try and find some way to generate pdfs
[09:42:50] * gseguin answers
[09:43:21] <johnbender> though I get the feeling that might be as much work as pulling the information out
[09:47:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: looking for/at xplatform servers
[09:48:36] <toddmparker_> html please johnbender
[09:48:46] <toddmparker_> the interactive demos are what makes the docs so nice
[09:49:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ah, you mean in response to the pd
[09:49:02] <johnbender> *pdf
[09:49:04] <johnbender> agreed
[09:49:43] <toddmparker_> is it really do bad to say "this uses ajax, either use browser x or y or open this on a webserver >> link to instructions"
[09:49:53] <toddmparker_> yeah johnbender
[09:50:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm not sure I use the online docs :/
[09:50:04] <toddmparker_> handle it with a bit of messaging
[09:50:30] <toddmparker_> meaning, they aren't useful to you?
[09:50:42] <johnbender> the packaged version isn't
[09:50:53] <toddmparker_> i think people just want to open a page, view source, thinker around
[09:51:02] <johnbender> I guess my answer to your question is based on how the people who download the docs feel about it
[09:51:31] <toddmparker_> people who view the zip docs are people who don't know how to use git
[09:51:44] <toddmparker_> they expect to just open a page
[09:53:18] <TehShrike|Work> ...derp
[09:53:22] <TehShrike|Work> That's what I've been doing :-x
[09:53:40] <TehShrike|Work> I've been using the online docs a lot
[10:11:29] <toddmparker_> TehShrike|Work: good to hear. so if the docs in the zip told you they needed to be run on a server, is that a huge issue?
[10:12:41] <toddmparker_> kinblas, johnbender, gseguin, Wilto, garann, etc - we shoudl establish some rules for committing fixes for 1.1 vs. 1.0.1
[10:13:15] <kinblas> and a release process in general
[10:13:20] <kinblas> so we don't have a repeat
[10:13:28] <toddmparker_> in general, i think that if we land a fix that isn't a new feature (or reply on a new 1.1 feature) and would be the kind of change we would have added last week, it should also go into 1.0.1
[10:13:58] <toddmparker_> if it's risky, changes the style/behavior/api - that must be in 1.1 (master) only
[10:14:11] <toddmparker_> just don't want 1.0.1 to miss out on fixes that could be added
[10:14:16] <toddmparker_> yeah
[10:14:42] <toddmparker_> kinblas, maybe you ad johnbender can outline some rules/procedures we can follow
[10:14:45] <kinblas> toddmparker_: perhaps we can use the status meeting to quickly pick and choose the weeks worth of fixes?
[10:15:00] <garann> like sprint planning? :)
[10:15:24] <kinblas> toddmparker_: not necessarily process, but for example, branching when we thiink we are good for a release, and then tagging the release offf that branch ... so it leaves the HEAD open for others to continue on post-release stuff
[10:15:39] <TehShrike|Work> toddmparker_: if they told me that the docs needed to be run on a server?
[10:15:39] <kinblas> garann: heh, you talkin' scrum?
[10:16:08] <garann> totes, kinblas
[10:16:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/5UJZqQ
[10:16:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] move pagechange binding for textarea autogrow outside the check for text content - John Bender
[10:17:26] <toddmparker_> good idea kinblas
[10:17:51] <kinblas> toddmparker_: that's kind of the standard strategy most companies use
[10:18:15] <kinblas> so engineers aren't twiddling their thumbs while the formal release process churns on
[10:18:36] <toddmparker_> sure. i think i just need an intro on how we should roll
[10:18:49] <toddmparker_> we can discuss on thursday next week
[10:18:59] <toddmparker_> no meeting this week
[10:19:02] <kinblas> no meeting between turkey?
[10:19:07] <kinblas> :-)
[10:19:08] <toddmparker_> oh, we have that RIm call today too
[10:19:17] <kinblas> yup
[10:19:54] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so regarding garann's  suggestion of sprints ... does core follow that type of model? Timed regular milestones/deadlines?
[10:20:00] <kinblas> or is it ready when it's ready?
[10:20:17] <toddmparker_> i think it's the latter
[10:21:03] <toddmparker_> i think we could consider doing sprint style things where we focus on  particular topic or two for say 2 weeks
[10:21:55] <toddmparker_> i'm open to whatever process we think we can really stick to
[10:22:13] <garann> kinblas: i was mostly kidding, though i like the idea of delegating out work for a short time period
[10:23:00] <kinblas> toddmparker_: garann: yeah, it's just hard when most of your resources are part-time
[10:23:15] <garann> yeah, for sure
[10:23:33] <kinblas> but yeah in general, goals are good :-P
[10:23:35] <toddmparker_> so garann - what's your avaialbility going forward?
[10:24:09] <garann> somewhere between 10-20 hours, probably?
[10:24:16] <garann> mostly on the weekend, though
[10:24:26] <garann> so i don't know how useful that is

[10:46:52] <toddmparker_> hey guys
[10:46:52] <garann> toddmparker_: no jqm stuff
[10:46:59] <toddmparker_> who can dial into the RIM call?
[10:47:03] <toddmparker_> any topics to cover
[10:47:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I can and we still don't have devices :(
[10:48:00] <johnbender> hmm, that makes me sound like I think I'm entitled which I'm clearly not
[10:48:13] <johnbender> but that's the only thing I can think of
[10:48:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: also it would be nice to know when BBX is coming out ... you know because it's important to us :/
[10:49:21] <gseguin> I can dial in as well but don't have much to say
[10:49:36] <toddmparker_> cool, up to you gseguin
[10:49:55] <toddmparker_> bbx is important for adobe?
[10:50:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: bbx is interesting to John :D
[10:50:27] <toddmparker_> ah
[10:50:27] <johnbender> I like the BB hardware
[10:50:47] <toddmparker_> what is bbx
[10:50:49] <johnbender> totally joking of course
[10:51:03] <toddmparker_> oh, heh
[10:52:41] <Wilto> The new Zelda game is out for Bbox, toddmparker_.
[11:00:00] <toddmparker_> ok, dialing in!
[11:02:49] <kinblas> toddmparker_: johnbender: Wilto: gseguin: you guys on?
[11:02:54] <kinblas> .. the call that is
[11:03:01] <Wilto> Listening from afar, if anyone needs me.
[11:03:20] <gseguin> I'm in

[11:27:22] <toddmparker_> cool stuff. works smoothly on playbook
[11:46:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do we have a MS call today?
[11:46:06] <johnbender> too?
[11:46:15] <toddmparker_> errr
[11:46:22] <toddmparker_> do you have an invite for one?
[11:46:33] <johnbender> indeed
[11:46:39] <johnbender> my alarm went off
[11:47:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ah I think I made that one
[11:47:03] * johnbender sighs
[11:47:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sorry :(
[11:47:15] <toddmparker_> no, my calendar is messed up
[11:47:22] <toddmparker_> so i thought i missed something
[11:48:33] <kinblas> johnbender: no MS meeting on my calendar
[11:48:43] <johnbender> kinblas: cool
[11:48:48] <kinblas> although if I remember correctly the initial invite for lastweeks meeting had the wrong date on it
[11:48:55] <kinblas> so perhaps it was fall out from that?
[11:49:11] * johnbender shrugs
[11:51:41] <Wilto> Nothin’ on my calendar either, but mine is simliarly broken since iCloud.
[11:55:43] <Wilto> Hey, is a “merge” called-for, for any reason?
[11:56:20] <Wilto> I’m getting some weird conflicts on version.txt. Do post-1.0 branch shenanigans call for a merge or anything?
[11:57:57] <Wilto> Those two messages brought to you by the Department of Redundancy Department.
[11:58:23] <gseguin> what files are conflicting?
[11:58:36] <Wilto> Just version.txt, which is strange.
[11:59:21] <Wilto> I mean, fixed easily enough, but I figure since it was behaving a little strange it was worth asking.
[12:19:50] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: so today I'm just doing some pull requests and then I'm going to try and grok what's in the build script
[12:20:06] <toddmparker_> sounds perfect johnbender
[12:20:11] <toddmparker_> we have lots of pulls
[12:20:17] <johnbender> indeed
[12:20:41] <johnbender> I made a dent before the conf but have to get back on top of it
[12:21:49] <Wilto> Oh, I can grab some of those today too.
[12:22:15] <Wilto> Anyone have any qualms about wrapping my head around a potential dialog refactor?
[12:22:48] <toddmparker_> +1
[12:22:59] <toddmparker_> make a branch and go to town
[12:23:29] <Wilto> Done and on it.

[14:37:26] <eddiemonge> johnbender: better? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3117/files

[14:40:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3097 from eddiemonge/intro - John Bender
[14:45:38] <johnbender> eddiemonge: as far as the message is concerened can we just do an alert area as a direct descendent of body that spans the docs in our warning colors (yellow gradient?)
[14:45:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[14:53:35] <toddmparker_> yep johnbender - that's pretty much what i mocked up
[14:53:54] <toddmparker_> i added it just above the copyright filter
[14:54:02] <toddmparker_> big yellow message bar
[14:54:18] <toddmparker_> that way it won't be missed but doesn't mess with the page too much
[15:03:26] <toddmparker_> gseguin, garann - do either of you have an android 2.3 device?
[15:04:49] <gseguin> I do
[15:05:20] <gseguin> toddmparker_: what can I test for you?
[15:05:54] <garann> i do not - designers took mine
[15:06:04] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3073#issuecomment-2820974
[15:06:11] <toddmparker_> those darn designers
[15:06:25] <toddmparker_> gseguin ^^
[15:06:35] <gseguin> yep, I'm on it
[15:07:55] <gseguin> 1.0 ?
[15:09:21] <toddmparker_> try 1.0 and test i guess
[15:10:23] <toddmparker_> johnbender and eddiemonge: http://jsbin.com/amixum/9/edit
[15:10:31] <toddmparker_> that is all we need to tack on
[15:10:43] <toddmparker_> and adjust the content to match what's going on
[15:13:05] <gseguin> toddmparker_: could not reproduce on either with 2.3.7
[15:13:32] <toddmparker_> arg. can you comment so i dont' seem crazy
[15:13:52] <gseguin> k
[15:13:53] <toddmparker_> i've seen that before, think it's a target mis-match
[15:14:12] <toddmparker_> but it's just a glitch on android that pops up if you hit on the edge of a button
[15:14:14] <johnbender> toddmparker_: eddie is offline, do you want to wait for him to make the alterations or is this pressing
[15:14:28] <toddmparker_> i still can't repro here tho, i tried to fat finger it
[15:16:00] <gseguin> ok I can now
[15:16:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2333
[15:16:31] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by wengzhiwen (2m, 3w ago): Some improvements of docs
[15:16:35] <gseguin> it happens if you're too close from the bottom of the button
[15:16:35] <johnbender> anything super pressing there?
[15:16:41] <johnbender> it's stale and needs changes
[15:16:47] <gseguin> toddmparker_:  ^^
[15:16:57] <johnbender> I'm going to close it and make a note to post back if they want to make some changes
[15:17:22] <toddmparker_> johnbender: that issue above?
[15:17:42] <johnbender> 2333
[15:18:07] <toddmparker_> ah, the pull
[15:18:13] <toddmparker_> sure
[15:18:32] <toddmparker_> did my snippet make sense?
[15:19:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the jsbin?
[15:19:58] <toddmparker_> ya
[15:20:06] <toddmparker_> basically what you said
[15:20:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah, but you want it at the bottom?
[15:20:38] <toddmparker_> i do because the docs will look like crap with it on top, might mess with examples too
[15:20:50] <toddmparker_> as long as it's there and bright yellow, it will be funds
[15:20:53] <toddmparker_> found

[15:30:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you want to wait for eddie to do that or should I just pull in his changes and add the snippet
[15:30:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: nevermind I'll just do it
