[04:18:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: CONGRATS!!
[04:18:24] <arschmitz> Thank you!
[04:18:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: everything went ok?
[04:19:15] <arschmitz> Yeah he's a bit premature so he is in nicu but doing good
[04:19:24] <uGoMobi> ok
[04:19:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and your wife ok too?
[04:20:23] <arschmitz> I think so I'm with baby now she was fine when I left
[04:20:34] <uGoMobi> good
[04:20:37] <arschmitz> Need to go check on her in a bit
[04:20:38] <uGoMobi> really happy for you man!
[04:20:42] <uGoMobi> yeah
[04:20:48] <arschmitz> Thank you very much!
[04:21:34] <arschmitz> It was a long night!
[04:21:53] <uGoMobi> yeah i can imagine you are exhausted now
[04:22:32] <arschmitz> But wrote like 10faqs lol
[04:22:51] <uGoMobi> omg
[04:22:53] <uGoMobi> lol
[04:23:02] <arschmitz> And did deep link rewrite to work with nav
[04:23:04] <uGoMobi> you are unstoppable
[04:23:16] <arschmitz> Started h2 widget lol
[04:23:17] <uGoMobi> shut up ;-)
[04:23:44] <agcolom> arschmitz: Fantastic news!!!! 
[04:26:01] <arschmitz> Lol had a lot of time while she slept

[06:37:16] <toddmparker> arschmitz: So glad everything went ok
[06:37:37] <toddmparker> Can't believe how much nervous/bored coding you did
[06:37:53] <arschmitz> Ha ha yea 
[06:37:58] <toddmparker> Figured you would stop off the map for a while, not double down 
[06:39:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: Lol yeah had to keep busy 
[06:39:15] <toddmparker> I nixed the guides section from the docs last night
[06:39:29] <toddmparker> Rather have agcolom add more pages to the API docs 
[06:39:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker: All is good though he will be here a while because he was premature
[06:39:42] <toddmparker> It us relaxing to code 
[06:40:02] <toddmparker> How early was he? 4 weeks?
[06:40:23] <arschmitz> toddmparker: Yeah I think those make sense there since they should not need demo style examples
[06:40:23] <arschmitz> Yeah 4 weeks 
[06:40:23] <arschmitz> So not too bad
[06:40:43] <toddmparker> Yeah, soon enough he'll catch up 
[06:40:52] <arschmitz> He's in nicu right now but he's doing good
[06:41:08] <toddmparker> Good. Must be a peanut.
[06:41:42] <toddmparker> How long is he staying in the hospital?
[06:42:56] <arschmitz> Not too small 5# 11oz so pretty good
[06:42:59] <arschmitz> We don't know yet
[06:44:45] <arschmitz> They are blocking irc on my laptop here :(
[06:44:56] <arschmitz> Have to use on phone lol

[06:56:28] <arschmitz> The linking is all working for docs
[06:56:39] <toddmparker> yeah?
[06:57:04] <toddmparker> so are you off work for a while?
[06:57:10] <arschmitz> Waiting to merge untill I finish widget though
[06:57:21] <arschmitz> Yup
[06:58:09] <arschmitz> I'll probably still be on here quit a bit working though to pass the time at hospital
[07:00:02] <toddmparker> cool
[07:00:11] <toddmparker> how's your wife doing?
[07:00:44] <arschmitz> She's good

[12:29:04] <_|Nix|_> OK, so there's no click or vclick on iOS 5 if I click anywhere except for a button ... that kinda sucks ... do I have to make the whole page one giant link?
[12:33:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I think we shouldn't do big code blocks in the widget sections
[12:33:29] <uGoMobi> I will update the "advanced" popup examples

[12:35:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: but I think it migh look bit messy if we use code highlighting for small code snippets
[12:35:21] <uGoMobi> might*
[12:35:40] <_|Nix|_> OK, well, this totally sucks ... iOS totally doesn't send out any clicks unless on a link.
[12:35:46] <_|Nix|_> I mean iOS 5.1 ...
[12:36:46] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's totally messed up.
[12:37:35] <_|Nix|_> Can someone with a real iOS 5.1 device please confirm? http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/click.html - clicking the link generates an alert, but clicking the big red div generates nothing.

[14:42:43] <toddmparker> gseguin: Using core's stuff sounds like a good idea

[14:50:21] <johnbender> gseguin: looking
[14:50:21] <johnbender> gseguin: lolol at 300 lines of javascript
[14:51:03] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah but more maintainable, I think
[14:51:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't agree but I don't mind bash so I'm biased
[14:51:49] <johnbender> gseguin: no one sees  that thing but the person who does the deploys too so feel free to proceed at the cost of dealing with it when it breaks
[14:52:23] <johnbender> gseguin: that is, if you want to swap it out do you mind taking over the deploys?
[14:52:32] <gseguin> I like the fact that it also does the tagging, checks the repo for uncommited changes and all that
[14:52:58] <gseguin> johnbender: I don't mind it
[14:53:08] <johnbender> gseguin: I assume it doesn't push the tags or anything?
[14:53:15] <gseguin> it does
[14:53:18] <johnbender> :(
[14:53:44] <johnbender> gseguin: if you can break that out we like to deploy without pushing the tag so todd can do a double check
[14:53:49] <johnbender> that is
[14:53:53] <johnbender> make the default not push the tags
[14:54:12] <gseguin> oh I see
[14:54:20] <gseguin> you can always retag
[14:54:53] <johnbender> that's what I do when we've pushed and someone wants to get in a last minute change
[14:55:06] <johnbender> but ideally we would avoid altering public refs like that
[14:55:45] <johnbender> gseguin: does the plugin site watch the tags?
[14:55:55] <johnbender> or is that a manual update process
[14:56:02] <gseguin> hmm, no idea
[14:59:47] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm sure it's manual
[14:59:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker, johnbender: There's a problem with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5593 ...
[15:00:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: looking
[15:00:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker, johnbender: If AJAX is off, there is no way to retrieve that a button was clicked ...
[15:00:39] * _|Nix|_ could be wrong ...
[15:01:16] * _|Nix|_ is not wrong.
[15:01:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it looks like you fixed that issue
[15:01:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I did, but look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3721
[15:02:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If you write your own submit handler, for example to prevent submission in case of invalid values, you cannot retrieve which button has caused the submit via $form.serialize().
[15:03:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: You can still hook into pbc and look at data.options.data (or wherever we store form data), but only if AJAX is enabled.
[15:03:27] <johnbender> hmm
[15:03:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: In the nav handler, we know which button caused the submit and we append its name/value to the submit data by hand.
[15:03:58] <johnbender> I assume this has to do with some code we dumped in to make sure that get submissions were serializing properly
[15:04:04] <johnbender> yah
[15:04:11] <johnbender> that
[15:04:15] <toddmparker> johnbender: Good call on being able to do a preview deploy w/o tagging. Nice to test things. I do like the idea of using staved stuff if we can, just so we get support
[15:04:33] <toddmparker> Thanks for hacking on this gseguin 
[15:04:46] <toddmparker> Staved = standard
[15:05:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I removed the add-hidden-input-during-vclick from the button widget because serialization was not working correctly when submitting from a non-enhanced button.
[15:05:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and I moved it into the nav vclick handler.
[15:05:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, the nav vclick handler has to be able to deal with any element, not just buttons.
[15:06:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, writing a selector that checks whether the element that was clicked will cause a submit is damn nigh impossible, and highly inadvisable to attempt (say the core guys).
[15:06:27] <johnbender> sounds about right
[15:06:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Instead, it's better to keep track of the last vclicked item, and check if that is an element of the form that ends up getting submitted ...
[15:07:04] <johnbender> urgh
[15:07:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If it is a member, and if its data is not present in the serialized data, then you add it by hand.
[15:07:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah that makes sense
[15:08:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The problem is that only our submit handler has access to this last-vclicked-element info, because it's tracked in a variable declared in the nav IIFE.
[15:08:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and our submit handler binds to document, not the form, so devs' submit handlers will likely get called first.
[15:09:18] <johnbender> hmmm
[15:09:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: form widget?
[15:09:52] <_|Nix|_> Did I say form widget? I meant form element.
[15:10:12] <johnbender> no I was wondering if we need a form widget
[15:10:17] <_|Nix|_> Oh.
[15:10:20] <johnbender> something to manage the binding at the form level
[15:10:24] <johnbender> and communicate with nav
[15:10:38] <johnbender> using the nav bindings
[15:10:56] <johnbender> we have a fair amount of form/submit logic
[15:10:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's not bad.
[15:11:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, it must involve a path that is not turned off when AJAX is disabled.
[15:11:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: another reason for it to live outside of nav :)
[15:11:58] <johnbender> it sounds like there are things that have to happen with the forms no matter what
[15:14:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I guess this all stems from the fact that we need to use $form.serialize() to get the form data so that we can check things before submitting. The API docs for .serialize() clearly state that it doesn't capture submit buttons because it cannot know if/which one was clicked.
[15:15:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We were providing a workaround for that by adding the hidden input.
[15:15:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think we were providing that work around because get method forms weren't including the information in the url on submission
[15:16:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: but either way
[15:16:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: are you on board with trying to pull the form handling into it's own widget with bindings to nav?
[15:16:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it may be that we'll need new/internal events
[15:17:00] <johnbender> or similar
[15:17:14] <johnbender> but that might be a good start for pulling other bits out like the other click handlers
[15:17:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm not sure. There's probably a lot of code out there that's pure jQuery that relies on the submit event alone.
[15:17:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and we want to play nice with that
[15:17:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, if we introduce "the jQM way" of doing forms, then that might require a rework of all that code.
[15:18:06] <johnbender> but it sounds like we need to bind to both the submit even and pbc to get the serialize data right
[15:18:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Only devs would need to  bind to both.
[15:18:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We have the item that caused the submit stored inside a variable.
[15:18:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm not sure what you mean
[15:19:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What we have now will always correctly submit a form.
[15:19:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5593
[15:19:18] <johnbender> I thought you were saying we could set it up soe the data was right for the submit binding
[15:20:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: "for the submit binding" - whose submit binding? Our own, or devs'?
[15:20:50] <johnbender> hmm I guess I"m confused
[15:20:52] <gseguin> my pleasure toddmparker 
[15:21:27] <johnbender> I thought the issue was that the $form.serialize won't work as expected in form level bindings
[15:22:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, actually that's funny, because it'll work exactly as documented in those bindings. IOW, the result won't include the button that caused the submit.
[15:22:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, devs expect that it will contain the button that caused the submit, because we had that workaround where we have the hidden input.
[15:23:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that wasn't the purpose of the workaround iirc 
[15:23:30] <johnbender> maybe you can do a blame?
[15:23:36] <johnbender> to check
[15:23:49] <johnbender> and look at the commit message / issue
[15:30:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I can't find an issue. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/91a5b8c09871c5dd940ee859651b979b4a75c3a9
[15:31:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Basically, if you call $form.serialize() you need to add a hidden input at the point where you know that an element that causes a submit has been clicked.
[15:32:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That point is pretty clear inside the button widget, because it only enhances things that end up submitting forms. However, it's not so clear inside the global vclick handler.
[15:34:12] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jnjc opened issue #5613: Panel Causes Listview To Reposition  02http://git.io/Bhm0ww
[15:34:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The funny thing is, if we revert to any hidden-input-based solution then https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3721 will not be fixed, because if you return false from a submit handler, then the submit handler responsible for removing the hidden input will not be called.
[15:35:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: With our current solution, it's still not fixed, because, although there is no proliferation of hidden inputs, the submit handler has no access to the information about which button was pressed. This is not actually bad, and it's documented as such in the core API.
[15:36:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, in a way we can mark https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3721 as both fixed (because the proliferation has been stopped), and wontfix, because it works as documented (in the core docs).

[15:53:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I have an idea for fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3721: After we serialize the form, we place the serialized data in $form.jqmData( "formData" ) and we tell people not to bind to the form's submit event, but let it bubble up to document. That way, their handler will end up after our handler, and the .jqmData() will already be in place.
[15:54:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: is the formData the standard location for the serialized data?
[15:54:15] <johnbender> I still think it's funny to expect them to bind up top
[15:54:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It's the only way they're gonna get which button caused the submit to happen.
[15:54:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can't we bind to submit on the forms in a given page instead of the document?
[15:54:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I suppose now that we have .on() we can ...
[15:55:06] <johnbender> that's why I was thinking the widget would be nice
[15:55:15] <johnbender> since it should manage the forms directly
[15:55:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the reason we have a document level form submit binding is, I imagine, so we only have to have on binding?
[15:55:44] <johnbender> no idea
[15:55:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Actually, if we bind to the forms directly, we can add the hidden input during that binding, and add another binding with .one() to document and remove the hidden input there.
[15:56:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, most likely.
[15:56:30] <johnbender> so if it's a widget that enhances with the page
[15:56:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: No, wait, strike that.
[15:56:39] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm fine leaving the hidden element in there
[15:56:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... because if any binding along the way returns false, the hidden input stays.
[15:56:52] <johnbender> there's no reason to be tricky about it
[15:57:04] <johnbender> we put the hidden element in there for a reason
[15:57:18] <johnbender> we can add something to prevent it if people don't want us monkeying with thier form elements
[15:57:29] <johnbender> (yet another reason to ahve a form widget)
[15:57:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, but if we do, it'll cause https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3721 whenever some dev decides to return false from her submit binding.
[15:58:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I thought that was because the binding came before our document level binding thereby preventing it from running and dealing with the issue
[15:58:38] <johnbender> "the binding" == the binding that returns fasle
[15:58:40] <johnbender> *false
[15:59:14] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. That's what causes stale hidden inputs to be left littering the forms.
[15:59:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: so if our "cleanup" binding comes first it shouldn't matter right?
[16:00:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: would that affect the serialization?
[16:00:36] <johnbender> or do we have a way to pre-determine what the serialized values will be
[16:00:43] <johnbender> eg, formData
[16:00:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We can document that, if you return false from your submit binding, please remove the hidden input. We can even provide a handy-dandy selector to make such removal easy.
[16:01:16] <johnbender> either way it would be better to have the binding at the form level
[16:01:21] <johnbender> and the management
[16:02:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, that's most likely true, but there might be devs who prefer to attach higher up. They'd be out of luck if we removed the hidden element before the event bubbled up.
[16:02:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: indeed
[16:03:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think we cannot solve this purely with code.
[16:03:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: agreed
[16:03:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We need to document one thing or the other.
[16:03:19] <johnbender> I think we have to establish with that most reasonable thing is in terms of behavior
[16:03:26] <johnbender> code around that
[16:03:29] <johnbender> and doc the rest
[16:03:45] <johnbender> I think requiring them to bind at the form level for serializations that take advantage of the hidden element is reasonable
[16:04:24] <johnbender> and why is that guy returning false!
[16:04:38] <johnbender> argh
[16:04:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If the form contains invalid data, prevent submission.
[16:04:43] <johnbender> that just hit me
[16:04:51] <johnbender> event.preventDefault() ?
[16:05:00] <_|Nix|_> True ...
[16:05:04] <johnbender> he doesn't want return false
[16:05:10] <johnbender> he wants prevent default
[16:05:12] <johnbender> argh
[16:05:14] <johnbender> red herring
[16:05:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Indeed ...
[16:05:24] <johnbender> ok
[16:05:29] <johnbender> so fuck the folks who return false
[16:05:32] <johnbender> there is no reason
[16:05:36] <_|Nix|_> :)
[16:05:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if we go with that assumption what do we get
[16:05:52] <johnbender> cleanup at the document level
[16:06:03] <johnbender> hidden input injection/serialization at the form level
[16:06:13] <johnbender> maybe we can manage it in a widget?
[16:06:32] <johnbender> and use _on for the document binding
[16:06:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There's still a problem. How do you know that you need to inject a hidden input?
[16:06:50] <johnbender> how did we know that before?
[16:07:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We knew because we were only doing it from button widgets.
[16:07:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, non0enhanced buttons also need to have hidden inputs added.
[16:07:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So we can't have that code inside the button widget.
[16:07:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It needs to deal with /all possible/ ways of submitting a form.
[16:07:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm so let me challenge that assumption
[16:08:29] <johnbender> we did it with the button because <input type="submit"> would get you a value on your form data correct?
[16:09:15] <_|Nix|_> Yes, although more cases than just type="submit" will end up contributing to the form data.
[16:09:39] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: alright I'm now knowledgeable about that but I wouldn't try to solve that problem any more than we already have
[16:09:47] <johnbender> we have to keep backward compat on that feature 
[16:10:16] <johnbender> ugh
[16:10:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: what was the original issue you fixed by moving the hidden input management into nav?
[16:11:06] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5593
[16:11:14] <_|Nix|_> No, wait.
[16:11:18] <_|Nix|_> That was the blocker.
[16:12:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you know what
[16:12:48] <johnbender> just leave it
[16:13:08] <johnbender> lets not add features or use cases to this morass
[16:13:17] <johnbender> it supports buttons in the form
[16:13:19] <johnbender> that's all
[16:13:24] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5387
[16:13:27] <johnbender> consider yourself lucky
[16:14:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah ... I mean, *shrug* ... .serialize() works as documented in core. If you call .serialize() you don't get the button. It's as simple as that.
[16:14:36] <johnbender> yes
[16:14:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The fact that we have a clever way around that for purposes of making AJAX nav work is our business.
[16:14:53] <johnbender> correct
[16:15:28] <johnbender> I'd rather spend the time closing a few issues (mind you I don't often close them) than supporting a feature which is broken at the get go I guess
[16:16:28] * johnbender is afk for a few minutes
[16:17:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I have one final thought that I feel I must offload, but I too agree that this is lower prio than most of our opens: If we require attachment at the document level, we can bracket devs' handlers by having a document-level handler declared just as we do now, and by adding a second handler with .one() from our global vclick handler. In between the two, a hidden input can live. But anyway ... we can save this for a less conge
[16:18:56] <_|Nix|_> I'll leave that bug open and write some of these things down.
[16:25:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Another thought: Devs know which button will cause form submission, because /they put it there/. So, let them throw a ball up in the air when the button is clicked, and let them catch it during submit and say "Aaaah! So, it was /you/!"
[16:26:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It's much harder for us as a framework than it is for devs.
[16:26:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... but that's exactly what we do in our vclick handler.
[16:39:41] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3721 closed *wipe hands*
