[03:58:21] <uGoMobi> ?tell toddmparker : re panel shadow: yes, the transition doesn't work because of the way that overlay div is generated. Let's discuss some solutions today. I also thought "push" was going to reveal the panel like it is done on Fb, YouTube, etc. That might change things.
[03:58:41] <uGoMobi> bot-t ? :(
[05:04:52] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi
[05:05:01] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:09:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: fixed the last major bug in range last night
[05:09:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great!
[05:10:37] <arschmitz> yup a few more smaller things and the js will be essentially done and ready for some real testing

[06:42:47] <toddmparker> good morning
[06:43:11] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yep, you're right on the transition
[06:43:24] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[06:45:22] <toddmparker> josh merrill has been giving me tips 
[06:45:37] <toddmparker> they built a nice one for their app, his notes are in the comments
[06:45:52] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:46:08] <toddmparker> but yeah, what we have called "pan" needs a new name and the page should site over the panel and slide away to reveal it
[06:46:08] <uGoMobi> i saw the demo posted there... looked nice
[06:46:39] <toddmparker> i'm probably going to need you and wilto to help us polish up the CSS
[06:46:54] <toddmparker> and get performance to be as slick as possible
[06:46:57] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes i thought that was going to be the difference between pan and push
[06:47:07] <uGoMobi> but i misunderstood probably
[06:47:11] <uGoMobi> sure np
[06:47:15] <uGoMobi> would like to work on that
[06:47:18] <toddmparker> still working not he difference
[06:48:00] <toddmparker> push it think should slide the panel in and also animate the width of the content (page) so it re-flows to leave them side-by-side
[06:48:24] <toddmparker> so pan seems wrong for the FB style menu - thoughts?
[06:49:13] <uGoMobi> something with reveal in it?
[06:49:26] <uGoMobi> or just reveal
[06:50:53] <toddmparker> guess i just blurted that out, but it seems to make sense
[06:51:15] <uGoMobi> or slideout
[06:51:31] <uGoMobi> depends on from what perspective
[06:51:44] <toddmparker> page or panel
[06:51:46] <uGoMobi> overlay is from panel perspective
[06:51:50] <toddmparker> we have overlay
[06:51:54] <toddmparker> right
[06:52:12] <uGoMobi> push a bit of both
[06:52:17] <toddmparker> slide open?
[06:52:17] <uGoMobi> the panel pushes the page
[06:52:33] <toddmparker> yeah, the panel pushes the page over
[06:52:50] <uGoMobi> downside of slide is that its more about the transition type... and they all have slide
[06:52:58] <toddmparker> yeah
[06:55:39] <toddmparker> leaning towards reveal
[06:55:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we have to close the panel on pagehide event
[06:55:55] <uGoMobi> yeah, so far reveal sounds most clear
[06:56:01] <toddmparker> right
[06:56:17] <toddmparker> reveal, push, overlay seem clear?
[06:56:31] <uGoMobi> to me it does
[06:57:42] <toddmparker> ok, so just one name change
[06:57:44] <toddmparker> good
[06:57:58] <toddmparker> so we'll re-name and change the animation
[06:58:01] <toddmparker> Switch to using translateX, transition smoothness tweaks
[06:58:16] <uGoMobi> with push the reflow will only happen at tablet/desktop width?
[06:58:23] <toddmparker> re: drop shadows, I wonder if that will slow things down
[06:58:34] <toddmparker> yes
[06:58:38] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:58:59] <uGoMobi> maybe we can set inset shadow on the panel
[06:58:59] <toddmparker> so at smaller widths, push will look like pan does now - it will animate in from the left
[06:59:26] <uGoMobi> ok clear
[06:59:32] <toddmparker> we can, but the issue I ran into was when I added a list view inside to the edge, it was over that shadow
[07:00:02] <uGoMobi> right
[07:00:15] <uGoMobi> other point is making the shadow themeable
[07:00:24] <toddmparker> eesh
[07:00:27] <uGoMobi> on the dark nav menu you will need less opacity
[07:01:13] <toddmparker> right now, shadows aren't themed so we might need to find a happy medium and explain how people can tweak the css?
[07:01:25] <toddmparker> i agree tho
[07:01:27] <uGoMobi> but maybe that is something we can look at for 1.4 too
[07:01:40] <uGoMobi> now we have more widgets that use shadow
[07:01:45] <uGoMobi> like popup and panel
[07:01:57] <toddmparker> sure. though, i'm leaning towards simplifying theming and spending more time documenting how to writ your own damn CSS
[07:02:03] <uGoMobi> we might want to add shadow style for ui-body-* for each swatch
[07:02:12] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:02:27] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:02:32] <toddmparker> problem is that you also may need different blur amounts, offsets, etc. depending on the widget
[07:02:47] <uGoMobi> true
[07:02:56] <toddmparker> i have a broader, lighter shadow on overlay panels and a tighter, darker inset shadow right now
[07:03:19] <toddmparker> theming is tricky
[07:03:26] <uGoMobi> so maybe a demo page where you can grab heavy medium light shadow styles from the code examples is better
[07:03:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker: if we are going to to theme shadows i would think it would be color only blur offset etc would be widget specific
[07:04:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes that's something we can look into
[07:05:42] <uGoMobi> we have to think about what structure we want to give to new docs... like a specific section about theming where you can grab custom CSS
[07:06:18] <uGoMobi> and a components reference section where we have demos where you can see all options and grab the markup
[07:06:25] <uGoMobi> something like that
[07:06:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that sounds good to me
[07:07:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure though... maybe easier to categorize all demos by widget/component
[07:07:49] <uGoMobi> i dunno what people prefer
[07:08:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats tough there are things that would makemore sense one way vs the other
[07:08:13] <toddmparker> i think that's an interesting idea
[07:08:47] <toddmparker> i like the idea of having most all common configurations of widgets that you can copy/paste as a section, organized by widget
[07:09:11] <toddmparker> and a separate section that shows how to customize and extend widgets
[07:09:23] <toddmparker> (themes, JS overrides, etc.)
[07:09:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker: maybe we could just have like a broad widget section with a section for general widget stuff and then sections for each specific widget
[07:09:53] <toddmparker> and maybe a section that has more real-world apps - simple twitter example, mail example, etc.
[07:09:57] <arschmitz> kinda the best of both worlds
[07:10:40] <toddmparker> arschmitz: what does "broad widget section" mean?
[07:12:14] <arschmitz> toddmparker: like when you go to the docs a section called "widgets" with in that there would be a section for things that are common to all widgets then a section for each widget and maybe a section for real world demos
[07:13:56] <arschmitz> that way we dont need to duplicate more general things for each widget
[07:14:05] <toddmparker> oh, sure
[07:14:17] <toddmparker> we can do a lot of cross-linking too
[07:14:26] <toddmparker> to the API site, across demos
[07:14:59] <arschmitz> absolutely i think that will be important with the seperation of the two
[07:15:14] <toddmparker> one big thing to think about - we still can't deep-link to an achor on a page which is going to be tricky if we want to link to a specific example
[07:15:46] <toddmparker> i understand that #anchors mess with history and ajax nav and it's hard to add that
[07:16:28] <toddmparker> but what if we rigged up something for demos that would let us smooth scroll to an id?
[07:16:34] <arschmitz> toddmparker: we can more or less i have a function i used for it in a past project only problem was with programatic scroll on some things but thats fixed anyway
[07:17:01] <toddmparker> <a href="page.html" data-scroll-to="#foo">
[07:17:25] <toddmparker> so this would be outside the nav
[07:17:33] <toddmparker> arschmitz: be cool to see what you used
[07:17:49] <arschmitz> this is a super simplified version of it http://uglymongrel.com/jqueryasia/#/19
[07:17:52] <toddmparker> this would be incredibly useful
[07:18:28] <toddmparker> so what are the issues?
[07:19:15] <arschmitz> none that i know of now that programatic scroll is fixed
[07:19:24] <Wilto> What are the haps, jQM?
[07:21:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i can roll this into something a little more usable when i get a few minutes
[07:21:43] <arschmitz> ill look up the actual version i used. the one above is from my presentation on jQuery asia as an example of a workaround for this so its really simplified
[07:22:03] <toddmparker> sure
[07:22:28] <toddmparker> if you want to take a crack at adding this as a utility or extension that we can drop in, that would be great
[07:22:53] <toddmparker> exposing the scroll target via a data-attr on the link is helpful, guessing you already have that 
[07:23:11] <Wilto> Yeah, Todd, should I get after the CSS on Jeff’s nav stuff?
[07:23:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i think thats how i did it its been like 6 months so details are fuzzy ha ha 
[07:26:54] <toddmparker> I just tacked on a todo list here for the changes and items remaining for the panels - feel free to add items:
[07:26:54] <toddmparker> http://oksoclap.com/C1Lv3eBfTF
[07:27:17] <toddmparker> Wilto: yep. see the todo list ^^
[07:27:28] <Wilto> Sweet; on it.
[07:27:50] <toddmparker> if you worked on transitions and css goodies, jeff can keep working on the JS stuff. re-naming "pan" to "reveal" to match how it looks
[07:27:59] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: is here to help if you need him
[07:28:29] <toddmparker> arschmitz: great, can't wait to see that. we might want to even add this as a feature for 1.3 if we like it. Or we can keep it internal.
[07:29:17] <arschmitz> toddmparker: cool either way if not we can also just link to it as a way to do this.
[07:31:35] <Wilto> WELL WELL WELL
[07:31:43] <Wilto> Look who finally decided to join us, JEFF.
[07:34:56] <toddmparker> hello, jlembeck 
[07:35:07] <toddmparker> i just dropped a mega todo on you fellas
[07:35:08] <jlembeck> hey
[07:35:15] <toddmparker> divide and conquer 
[07:35:26] <jlembeck> Saw that. Into it. Chugging a cup of coffee and then running at it with reckless abandon
[07:35:38] <toddmparker> let me know if the new animations and names make sense to y'all. i got schooled on the FB style.

[08:05:39] <agcolom> Good afternoon!
[08:09:47] <Wilto> Hey, I’m tagging in on this slide-nav-ish stuff with jlembeck. Anyone available to do some testing on that unprefixed transitions branch? 
[08:12:58] <agcolom> Wilto: hi, I spotted something this morning... but it looks different now... I had a bug with the iPAd
[08:13:17] <agcolom> I can go and get it now, and test on a few devices
[08:13:27] <Wilto> Ah man, that would be awesome.
[08:13:55] <Wilto> Mostly I wanna re-check that we’re not getting transitions on anything what ought not be getting them.
[08:14:15] <agcolom> just give me 2 minutes... which link should I test? (I can test on 3 or 4 ipads and 1 iphone, 2 ipod touches) and Mac destops...
[08:14:50] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I am on that Chromium issue
[08:15:30] <agcolom> ok, I'm ready!
[08:15:48] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Any clues?
[08:16:06] <agcolom> Wilto: is it this page? http://jquerymobile.com/branches/SlidingPanel/docs/content/content-overflow.html
[08:16:14] <Wilto> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/unprefixed-transitions/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[08:16:18] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/unprefixed-transitions/index.html
[08:16:32] <uGoMobi> right
[08:16:53] <Wilto> As compared to http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[08:17:35] <Wilto> They might just fade and they might do nothing, depending on the browser. We just want to make sure it’s *consistent*.
[08:17:59] <uGoMobi> Wilto: no real clues yet, will bring in changes step by step and see when it breaks
[08:18:08] <Wilto> breakingStuff++
[08:20:02] <Wilto> I don’t want to stress *too* much where it’s Chromium, but I’d rather know than not.
[08:20:51] <uGoMobi> agreed, but it's so weird cos it used to work and there is no issue on Chrome
[08:20:58] <uGoMobi> hard to accept
[08:21:47] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jlembeck pushed 1 new commit to 06slide-panel: 02http://git.io/3NMkTw

[08:22:52] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: hey Jeff! FYI - I just added something to slide-panel to do list... close panel on "pagehide"
[08:23:13] <jlembeck> !!! good find! thanks!
[08:24:23] <Wilto> Good catch.
[08:24:41] <Wilto> uGoMobi: In fairness, I have seen some weird 3D transform issues in Canary on OSX.
[08:24:53] <Wilto> They’re always fine by the time they hit Chrome, though.
[08:29:49] <uGoMobi> Wilto: right, but since they do work on master let see if I can find what caused the regression... not going to spend too much time on it though
[08:30:01] <Wilto> Oh, worth looking into for sure. Thanks, dude!
[08:30:16] <Wilto> I should probably get a Linux VM goin’ at some point.
[08:30:22] <arschmitz> toddmparker: found my old implementation of deeplinking its a widget (i know im sure your schocked i made it a widget) put a quick demo / branch together
[08:32:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker: demo - http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/scroll-link/docs/forms/slider/ code - https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/blob/scroll-link/js/widgets/scrollLink.js
[08:34:22] <agcolom> Wilto: flow doesn't look good on iPad-2 iOS 4.3.3 (but the result is the same whether I use the normal or the unprefixed branch). All fine on iPAd 1 iOS 5.1.1
[08:35:29] <Wilto> Huh.
[08:35:45] <Wilto> Like *terrible*, or just a little off?
[08:36:15] <agcolom> I'll try to do a video... 
[08:46:55] <agcolom> Wilto: video coming soon... in the mean time, I have a bug on iOS 5.1.1 (iPAd 3) for http://jquerymobile.com/branches/SlidingPanel/docs/content/content-overflow.html
[08:47:12] <Wilto> Uh oh.
[08:47:17] <Wilto> As in “working differently?”
[08:47:28] <Wilto> Oh, oh, on the panel thing.

[08:48:11] <agcolom> if you touch the push panel right, the sizing of the window is incorrect... will do a screen shot...
[08:54:04] <toddmparker> arschmitz: hey, that scroll doodad works great.
[08:54:14] <toddmparker> code seems pretty tiny too
[08:54:28] <toddmparker> i'd vote to add this in as a feature. we sure as heck need it.
[08:54:56] <toddmparker> would make pages so much easier to use
[08:55:26] <toddmparker> arschmitz: can you link to a page and down to an anchor or only anchor down once a page is loaded?
[08:55:59] <agcolom> Wilto: the video for flow (same whether prefixed or not) on iPad 2 iOS 4.3.3 http://users.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/JQM/IMG_0137.MOV
[08:56:08] <agcolom> (sorry the quality is not great!
[08:56:09] <arschmitz> only once page is loaded
[08:56:24] <arschmitz> otherwise we would have to really dig into nav
[08:56:33] <toddmparker> yeah, would be much harder
[08:56:39] <arschmitz> MUCH!
[08:57:10] <toddmparker> is johnbender here?
[08:57:21] <johnbender> toddmparker: indeed
[08:57:29] <toddmparker> just curious if he has any clever ideas to support that
[08:57:41] <Wilto> Ugh, the tiling thing.
[08:57:49] <Wilto> Yeah, nothing we can really do about that, agcolom.
[08:58:25] <johnbender> toddmparker: support what? something to do with scrolling but I don't know anything else
[08:58:28] <johnbender> arschmitz: ?
[08:58:36] <toddmparker> hey johnbender - been talking about the sad state of anchors
[08:58:47] <johnbender> ah, in pages?
[08:58:53] <arschmitz> yes 
[08:58:53] <toddmparker> being able to anchor down
[08:58:57] <toddmparker> yeah
[08:59:09] <agcolom> panel issue on iOS 5.1.1 iPAd 3 (on push panel right) http://users.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/JQM/PHOTO2.PNG http://users.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/JQM/PHOTO1.PNG
[08:59:11] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker: well one large problem with that is embedding the information in the hash
[08:59:12] <toddmparker> been on my wish list for  along time
[08:59:14] <johnbender> how would we do that?
[08:59:22] <toddmparker> johnbender: yeah, that is complex
[08:59:31] <agcolom> Wilto: yes I agree...
[08:59:35] <johnbender> we have to encode that somehow
[08:59:42] <toddmparker> but maybe as a fist step, we just do this via a different mechanism
[08:59:52] <toddmparker> not deep linkable
[09:00:11] <toddmparker> for example, arschmitz made a simple plugin to silent scroll - http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/scroll-link/docs/forms/slider/
[09:00:12] <johnbender> toddmparker: alright, I thought that was the feature
[09:00:20] <agcolom> toddmparker: maybe this is for you and jlembeck ? (panel issue on iOS 5.1.1 iPAd 3 (on push panel right) http://users.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/JQM/PHOTO2.PNG http://users.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/JQM/PHOTO1.PNG)
[09:00:47] <agcolom> this does not happen on iOS 4.3.3
[09:00:49] <johnbender> toddmparker: aren't there plugins to scroll to elements?
[09:00:52] <toddmparker> johnbender: it's been on the feature list forever, yeah
[09:00:59] <toddmparker> arschmitz has one - https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/blob/scroll-link/js/widgets/scrollLink.js
[09:01:00] <johnbender> that is, do we need to make it part of the library?
[09:01:18] <johnbender> doing it as part of the url makes sense for the library
[09:01:24] <toddmparker> i was saying how much easier the demos would be to navigate if we could scroll down like that
[09:01:36] <johnbender> toddmparker: lets just use it for the docs then
[09:01:43] <toddmparker> we can for sure
[09:01:51] <johnbender> arschmitz: what's involved in that
[09:01:56] <johnbender> do you need position information or is it simple
[09:02:05] <arschmitz> johnbender: toddmparker question was more to do with doing it in a link from another page
[09:02:16] <johnbender> arschmitz: that's what I thought
[09:02:18] <toddmparker> my question for you is how hard it would be to take what arschmitz did and make it work across pages
[09:02:26] <johnbender> see my original comment
[09:02:32] <johnbender> we need to encode it in the hash
[09:02:35] <johnbender> and in the link
[09:02:44] <johnbender> will it work with embedded pages?
[09:02:52] <johnbender> obviously it probably should
[09:02:58] <toddmparker> we need to figure out the hash url if we want to do this 100% right
[09:03:01] <toddmparker> correct
[09:03:02] <johnbender> yep
[09:03:12] <jlembeck> agcolom: I'll take a look. Thanks!
[09:03:16] <arschmitz> johnbender: right now its super simple only handles links to the same page
[09:03:25] <johnbender> once we figure out the encoding we can probably just do a one off pagechange binding 
[09:03:30] <arschmitz> its something i just had from an old project
[09:03:30] <toddmparker> but if we wanted to be able in the docs to link to page B and scroll to #foo, could we do something lighter?
[09:04:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: if it was an ajax link we could make a quick hack solution if its external much harder
[09:04:15] <toddmparker> nag looks for a data-attr with the ID of the thing to scroll to. if it's there, it silent scrolls down
[09:04:18] <toddmparker> nav
[09:05:01] <toddmparker> ah, that's true. i think we're going to do a bunch of ajax false links because we load custom scripts and styles
[09:05:05] <toddmparker> so that is harder
[09:05:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah that was my concern.
[09:06:01] <agcolom> jlembeck: on that page on my iPhone (iOS 5 something) I also get a black line of 1 or 2 px at the top, which remains at the top of the window as you scroll down... that line goes nearly all the way across the screen but not quite, only about 95%. 
[09:06:14] <agcolom> can you see that or would you like a screenshot?
[09:06:28] <toddmparker> agcolom: the styles are pretty early on for panels so there will be a ton of broken things today
[09:06:59] <agcolom> toddmparker: oh ok :-) should I not worry about that for now then?
[09:07:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i have an idea that might get us by for now for external links but ill have to look into it to see how hard it will be and wouldnt be something for the library for sure just for docs
[09:09:08] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah, let's plan on this being an internal utility for now so we can do what makes sense for our needs
[09:09:29] <toddmparker> if people want the plugin, we'll show 'em where it is, but we don't' have to ship with it
[09:09:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ill let you know what i come up with for this.
[09:09:49] <toddmparker> so if you don't mind hacking something together and adding it to the demos folder
[09:09:51] <toddmparker> ok
[09:10:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/SlidingPanel/docs/content/content-overflow.html is an old branch
[09:10:57] <toddmparker> data-scroll-link might be easier to read, fewer lll's in a row
[09:11:11] <toddmparker> ah, yeah that branch is old
[09:11:13] <uGoMobi> there is a new branch slide-panel 
[09:11:25] <agcolom> uGoMobi: oh! ;-) oops! Sorry! 
[09:12:20] <toddmparker> agcolom: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel/docs/panels/index.html
[09:12:41] <toddmparker> jlembeck and Wilto are doing some serious re-factoring right now so...
[09:12:47] <toddmparker> and push is busted atm
[09:13:28] <jlembeck> toddmparker: just fyi the right panel doesn't have ui-responsive on it
[09:13:56] <jlembeck> I was playing with it in the docs and forgot to put it back on
[09:15:21] <toddmparker> ah, that's why it was so wide
[09:15:48] <toddmparker> that class pattern is how we're dealign with including, but not forcing, breakpoints
[09:15:53] <agcolom> oh, yes, that's what I tested this morning... I think the bug is there as well....let me try..
[09:16:53] <agcolom> oh no, the bug is gone...
[09:16:59] <agcolom> sorry...
[09:17:03] <toddmparker> agcolom: yeah, these are barely working right now
[09:17:14] <toddmparker> might want to do QA tomorrow :)
[09:17:49] <toddmparker> so i wonder what we should do in you're scrolled way down and open a panel
[09:18:11] <toddmparker> one option would be to add a scroll to top if you've scrolled down more than X
[09:18:39] <toddmparker> X could be 1/2 a screen height or more, who knows
[09:18:44] <agcolom> that would make sense
[09:18:56] <toddmparker> just be good to not scroll to top if it's just a few pixels, will feel jumpy
[09:19:02] <agcolom> because the stuff on the panel way have a smaller height than the page
[09:19:09] <agcolom> may ^
[09:19:11] <toddmparker> right
[09:19:34] <toddmparker> common convention is to have the menu button in the top bar so it's not an issue most times
[09:20:02] <toddmparker> sort of odd to open a panel when scrolls down a million pixels
[09:20:13] <agcolom> exactly.
[09:20:38] <toddmparker> alternatively, we could create a demo showing how to use silent scroll to do something like this.
[09:20:48] <toddmparker> which might be better. less to support
[09:21:14] <agcolom> and you never want to be in a position where someone is down a page, opens a panel which by then has nothing to show... may not be obvious to the user they have to scroll all the way up to see the menu at teh top of the panel...
[09:22:41] <agcolom> Oh, btw, can we update themeroller to jQuery core 1.8.2 (in the demo code/download)?
[09:22:54] <agcolom> currently it is 1.7.2
[09:24:02] <agcolom> I'm happy to do it, but I wanted to get permission first and make sure that wouldn't break anything
[09:25:19] <agcolom> I think it's just a matter of changing here: https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/blob/master/version.php
[09:25:43] <agcolom> "1.2.0" => "1.7.2" to "1.2.0" => "1.8.2" ?
[09:30:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ok got a quick hack version working for external links
[09:30:04] <toddmparker> agcolom: yes, we should

[09:30:08] <toddmparker> ming making a TR issue?
[09:30:20] <toddmparker> arschmitz: cool
[09:30:28] <arschmitz> it uses a query param
[09:30:40] <arschmitz> you add ?scrollTo=(the id you want)
[09:30:49] <arschmitz> and it will scroll to that id on pageshow
[09:31:01] <toddmparker> seems reasonable for our needs
[09:31:11] <toddmparker> won't work for everyone, but this is for us
[09:31:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker: exactly thats why i said deff not for library but for us it works
[09:31:31] <toddmparker> so that would allow us to deep link to a section then
[09:31:36] <arschmitz> yup
[09:31:42] <arschmitz> let me push my changes and ill show you
[09:31:44] <toddmparker> think that's great

[09:33:37] <agcolom> toddmparker: great! Making the change now...
[09:34:01] <arschmitz> lol http://www.uglymongrel.com/jqm/scroll-link/docs/forms/slider/?scrollTo=mini-version
[09:34:13] <agcolom> toddmparker: good news about the api docs format. The quick nav is going to come just after the short desc but before the long desc :-)
[09:34:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker: so no that takes care of external and same page. just need to handle ajax links now and we will have a full solution for the docs at least
[09:37:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Any luck switching to phantomjs 1.7.0 to stop experiencing the spontaneous sequence test timeouts?

[09:38:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: haven't tried yet, almost finished with nav
[09:38:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: one more test
[09:38:41] <johnbender> scrolling :/
[09:39:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nice!
[09:42:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Might wanna have a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5249 right afterwards, or maybe even before merging ... not sure if it's possible to unset isPageTransitioning before we trigger page-related signals from nav. The problem is that, if one of the handlers throws an unhandled exception, the whole frame is torn down and we never unset isPageTransitioning ...
[09:42:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... rendering nav useless forever after.
[09:43:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm, yah I'm not a big fan of reference counting without a bit more infrastructure
[09:43:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'll think about it but I'm just going to get this thing merged and deal with the fallout
[09:43:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Roger that!
[09:43:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: then I have to back track and deal with some details internally
[09:43:54] <johnbender> but I can do that while doing other things
[09:48:08] <toddmparker> agcolom: great. the quick nag was so far down
[09:49:16] <toddmparker> arschmitz: that link didn't seem to scroll
[09:49:29] <arschmitz> http://www.uglymongrel.com/jqm/scroll-link/docs/forms/slider/?scrollTo=mini-version ?
[09:49:43] <toddmparker> huh, that worked
[09:50:02] <arschmitz> and this works for internal ajax links too
[09:50:33] <toddmparker>  href="#step-increment" data-scrolllink="true"
[09:50:42] <toddmparker> gotcha
[09:51:00] <toddmparker> so we only need the query param if going outside the page
[09:51:26] <arschmitz> right if your linking in the same page just add data-scrolllink="true"
[09:51:39] <arschmitz> if its another page use the query param
[09:51:43] <toddmparker> works for me
[09:52:09] <toddmparker> anyone have feedback or concerns before we add this to the docs js?
[09:52:30] <toddmparker> i'd prefer data-scroll-link="true"
[09:52:41] <toddmparker> easier to ready
[09:52:44] <arschmitz> toddmparker: do we use many multi-page documents it does not work to link to another internal page
[09:52:56] <arschmitz> toddmparker i agree
[09:52:58] <toddmparker> ah
[09:53:05] <toddmparker> we don't in the docs, no
[09:53:12] <arschmitz> cool then not a problem lol
[09:53:33] <arschmitz> if it comes up i can make it work for that but no sense if we dont use it
[09:53:53] <toddmparker> if it's not too hard, we can add it whenever
[09:54:38] <arschmitz> i like this because i always wanted to be able to jump down to a section or click a method or option and jump right to it 
[09:54:49] <toddmparker> might be a good idea to add a demos page for anchor links that explains this is a plugin, what it does and how to use it
[09:55:07] <toddmparker> can see people copying this syntax and saying "what?!"
[09:55:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: for sure otherwise people will get very confused why it works for us
[09:55:26] <toddmparker> we have special powers
[09:55:53] <arschmitz> ill clean it up and make a repo for it so we can link to that
[09:55:54] <toddmparker> i'm ok with showing off 3rd party plugins in the demos provided we don't go overboard 
[09:55:58] <toddmparker> cool
[09:56:39] <arschmitz> toddmparker: espically for things where it provides functionality that "should" be there like this or the extension to the swipe event
[09:56:56] <arschmitz> but where its not a good canadit for the library
[09:58:00] <arschmitz> i think ill harmoize the query param name and the data-attribute name too
[09:59:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker: maybe data-scrollto="true"  and ?scrollto=id 
[09:59:13] <toddmparker> arschmitz: right
[09:59:21] <toddmparker> or query param support
[09:59:36] <toddmparker> i like
[09:59:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: sweet
[10:00:02] <toddmparker> to scroll to top, i guess you just ID you page div?
[10:00:11] <arschmitz> this was a quick easy one for once!
[10:00:13] <toddmparker> your
[10:00:20] <arschmitz> hmm have not tried but yeah that should work
[10:00:22] <toddmparker> yeah. no nav = easy
[10:00:28] <arschmitz> let me try
[10:00:30] <toddmparker> k
[10:00:50] <toddmparker> be good to explain that on the demo page too
[10:02:02] <arschmitz> hmm so a lot of the pages dont have ids for the page div
[10:02:23] <arschmitz> so i think ill add #top will scroll to top?
[10:03:24] <toddmparker> ah, like a reserved keyword?
[10:03:31] <toddmparker> maybe just "top"
[10:03:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker: exactly
[10:03:45] <arschmitz> yeah that way cant be confused with an id
[10:03:51] <toddmparker> if it has a #, we assume it's an ID but "top" can be a special case
[10:04:01] <toddmparker> nice, even easier
[10:04:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i like that sounds perfect
[10:04:20] <toddmparker> so i'm running out for a loooong meeting
[10:04:40] <toddmparker> will check in when i can. Wilto and jlembeck are still jamming on panels
[10:04:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ok take it easy. 
[10:05:48] <Wilto> Def Panel-y Jam.

[11:35:25] <_|Nix|_> What do you guys think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2427? Do any of you know any of the tricks to make server-side redirects visible to $.ajax? I asked one of the commenters to elaborate on the method mentioned in passing, but no response.
[11:35:33] <_|Nix|_> I'm inclined to close that one.
[11:36:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: redirects aren't exposed in XHR V1, we could support tricks that use different 200 level responses but it's a small use case
[11:37:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The guy talks about 280 - I haven't even seen that documented anywhere ...
[11:37:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: at least that's what I recall
[11:37:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's a workaround
[11:37:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think it's already recorded as a feature
[11:37:26] <johnbender> it's a feature request
[11:37:31] <johnbender> so I would just tell him that and mark it as one
[11:37:33] <johnbender> move it to the list]
[11:37:45] <johnbender> also point out that it's not likely we'll get to it
[11:38:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, I'll re-milestone it for 1.4.0 and mark it low prio and feature request.
[11:38:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What say you?
[11:38:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: toddmparker: how are we handling feature requests these days
[11:38:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think that one is in the wiki'
[11:38:42] <johnbender> but I don't know if we still use that list

[12:39:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2427 can be solved by devs if they handle pagebeforechange where the data.toPage is a jQuery object. They can then call replaceState manually ... this works only if pushState is available, of course, but that should cover a lot of cases, right?
[12:40:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I mean, they can check the contents of data.toPage and update the location accordingly.
[12:48:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OTOH, I dunno what the implications are if devs call replaceState behind our back ... I guess they'd overwrite the structure we put there ...
[13:07:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think there is a solution to this problem that does not require a code change from us.
[13:10:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The handlers to the pageload event receive everything we ourselves get back from $.ajax (textStatus and xhr). So, if devs can affect the server-side to leave a mark in the xhr that a redirect has taken place, they can subsequently handle the ensuing pagebeforechange to set the url in the pbc data. That's the URL that will be passed to path.set(). So, they can know when the page comes it that it was a redirect, and they can

[13:25:01] <tybenz> johnbender: ping
[13:29:03] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: js/widgets/panel.js:247 ( in the "pagehide" handler ): You should use $( ".ui-active-panel" ).panel( "close" ) instead of $( ".ui-active-panel" ).data( "mobile-panel" ).close() because what if you have multiple panels? What it you have none? If you have none .data() will return undefined, and you'll get "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'close' of undefined" - which is what I got just now.
[13:29:40] <jlembeck> _|Nix|_: Thanks!
[13:29:47] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: A few lines down from there, you're being more prudent because you're checking $( ".ui-active-panel" ).length ...
[13:30:05] <jlembeck> Yeah, I must have missed it when adding it
[13:30:23] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: I'm assuming .ui-active-panel will only be set on one panel at a time, so I guess my comment about multiple panels is irrelevant.
[13:30:31] <jlembeck> yes.
[13:30:47] <jlembeck> oh. that was how it was intended
[13:30:48] <jlembeck> but
[13:30:48] <jlembeck> hrm
[13:30:58] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: You still shouldn't access the .data( "mobile-widgetname" ) unnecessarily, if an API has been defined for it.
[13:33:24] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Interesting though ... you gave me an idea that might simplify popup. The idea being that, if popup ever encounters a pagehide while displayed, it should tear itself down immediately - no exit transition, nothing. Just disappear.
[13:34:06] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Currently it does that during pagebeforechange if the destination URL is not the same as the URL of the page from which it was opened. However, that's a tricky thing to get right.
[13:34:51] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: This might be easiert.

[13:36:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[13:36:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: since your working on the new docs i wanted to show you what i put together for toddmparker to allow deeplinks in the docs
[13:37:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: demo docs that is
[13:37:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw you guys talking about that
[13:37:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://www.uglymongrel.com/jqm/scroll-link/docs/forms/slider/
[13:37:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: where do you want me to look?
[13:37:55] <uGoMobi> ok got it
[13:38:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah they shouldn't be monkeying with the browser history
[13:38:35] <johnbender> that will eff everything up
[13:38:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats example usage you can see i added a jump to section at top and a return to top in each section, and also all the data-attributes link directly to that attribute
[13:39:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Right, but I think I've found a way they don't have to. 
[13:39:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't want to support non standard redirects
[13:39:18] <johnbender> and I'd rather not make an api for one person
[13:39:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that would be good
[13:39:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I don't think we need to support any redirects.
[13:39:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: but again, I would never council that they monkey with the browser history
[13:39:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If I can get this demo to work, we can show people how to get the right URL into the location bar using our existing code.
[13:40:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can't they hook into the ajax request with ajax filters or some such in jQuery?
[13:40:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: They'd be modifying the URL in the pbc data object.
[13:40:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Unnecessary. They get all the xhr info during pageload.
[13:40:31] <johnbender> ah
[13:40:32] <johnbender> nice
[13:40:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that works nicely
[13:40:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and so the pageload handler can do a .one( "pagebeforechange" ... ) and update the url in data ...
[13:41:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We call path.set() with the updated URL, and pushState picks that up.
[13:41:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in the docs/demos folder there is a subfolder _demo-template
[13:41:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there are basicly 2 conventions to use it if the link is to a section on the same page you just add data-scrollto="true" if its to an external page you add a query param ?scrollto={id without the hash)
[13:42:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw that
[13:42:13] <arschmitz> cool
[13:42:21] <uGoMobi> seems perfect for our demos
[13:42:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Unfortunately, I've recently gotten much better at client-side scripting than server-side scripting, so my php skillz0rz are rather lacking.
[13:42:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah that was the idea toddmparker: REALLY wanted the ability for crosslinking in the docs
[13:42:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm sending header( "X-Redirect: http://localhost/nix/jqm/jquery-mobile/redirect-target.html" ); from PHP, but I'm not finding it in the xhr ...
[13:43:02] <uGoMobi> about that template folder... can you add an example of those 2 conventions there, like i did for source code view
[13:43:04] <johnbender> :(
[13:43:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure
[13:43:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I just gotta keep digging, I guess ...
[13:43:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and your code can be added to jqm-demos.js
[13:43:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great!
[13:44:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: perfect. yeah im going to remove from current docs since they are going away so no point in updateing all the pages like this one just made a good use example
[13:45:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think the best we can do is to create the new docs in the demos folder
[13:46:07] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15jlembeck pushed 2 new commits to 06slide-panel: 02http://git.io/HFwgNg
[13:46:07] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06slide-panel 145c91fd6 15Jeffrey Lembeck: Added check to make sure that ui-panel-active exists before calling for...
[13:46:07] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06slide-panel 14bc49022 15Jeffrey Lembeck: Shouldn't call directly into the object when I have an API for it...
[13:46:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when we are ready we can replace docs by the content of the demos folder
[13:46:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes  i just meant that there is no point to updateing the current docs to use this like my example since its going away
[13:46:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes true
[13:47:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if they werent i would say we should update all the pages like the slider one because it is a lot more user friendly
[13:48:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz:  it is, so we can apply it to new page we create in the demos folder
[13:48:46] <uGoMobi> also if we add pages there on whichwe explain how things work
[13:49:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah toddmparker: already asked me to make a demo of this because people will be asking how we are able to do it for sure. 
[13:49:42] <uGoMobi> yeah for sure
[13:49:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: since we explicitly say its not supported then BAM it works for us lol
[13:50:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you can add one demo page there on which you put your script in the head
[13:50:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah we might make people jealous ;)
[13:50:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i have a few demos i need to catch up on
[13:51:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: keep getting sidetracked with new stuff like this :)
[13:51:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I know what you mean
[13:51:42] <uGoMobi> always something new to look into
[13:52:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: about the docs structure
[13:52:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup but our progress lately on stuff has been truely pretty amazing 
[13:53:13] <uGoMobi> maybe we can come up with a navmenu with the ability to sort by widget or by topic (RWD, theming, etc.)
[13:53:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that would be cool
[13:53:42] <arschmitz> could make it almost like tabs
[13:54:02] <uGoMobi> yeah two tabs or a radio horizontal controlgroup
[13:54:02] <arschmitz> in the menu
[13:54:06] <uGoMobi> or flip swith
[13:54:10] <uGoMobi> switch*
[13:54:12] <arschmitz> yeah anything like that
[13:54:23] <arschmitz> even a select lol
[13:54:41] <uGoMobi> yeah we have so many features
[13:54:43] <uGoMobi> :D
[13:54:52] <toddmparker> johnbender: same old story on feature requests, flag, close and add to the wiki (or ask them to)
[13:55:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have a site i did that has tabs of listviews with nested collapsibles lol it actually works really slick though
[13:55:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we should create the menu dynamically so we only have the links to the pages in the markup once
[13:56:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats a good idea rather then copying over and over and over and having to make sure they all stay in sync
[13:56:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that sounds like something frequent (Sven Franck) was working on
[13:56:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am curious what your version looks like
[13:56:44] <arschmitz> hold on ill give you a link
[13:56:45] <uGoMobi> because I saw quite some issues in the CSS
[13:57:14] <arschmitz> this is a page that isnt finished but so far it works really well
[14:01:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: shoot its only in a members area so i cant just send you a link right this second
[14:01:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: see toddmparker response on the feature requests
[14:01:45] <johnbender> obviously if there's a workaround it would still be good to post that 
[14:01:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it's ok, we can look at it some other time
[14:01:50] <johnbender> toddmparker: GREAT NEWS
[14:01:59] <johnbender> test suite is green
[14:02:01] <johnbender> :)
[14:02:02] <johnbender> :)
[14:02:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah at some point ill throw it in a jsbin or something
[14:02:05] <uGoMobi> WHOEHA
[14:02:14] <uGoMobi> great johnbender!!
[14:02:15] <arschmitz> johnbender: NICE!
[14:02:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool
[14:02:43] * johnbender dances a little jig
[14:02:50] <johnbender> I'll start the merge this afternoon
[14:02:56] <johnbender> hopefully I'll make a push by tomorrow
[14:02:59] * uGoMobi cheers for johnbender
[14:03:20] <johnbender> _fuck_ integration tests for refactoring 
[14:03:21] <johnbender> zomg
[14:03:28] <johnbender> I knew it was going to be painful
[14:03:30] <johnbender> but not this bad
[14:03:31] <johnbender> holy crap
[14:03:48] <johnbender> this is the one thing we _must_ fix as we refactor

[14:07:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I have tried the sequence tests so I imagine I'll have to do something abotu that but otherwise good to go
[14:07:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I don't understand - you have to do something about what?
[14:09:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Where's the wiki for feature requests?
[14:11:11] <gseguin> YAY! BENDER FOR PRESIDENT!
[14:11:29] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Gotta wait four years ...

[14:38:16] <_|Nix|_> L8R all!
[14:38:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: adding dialog close button info to our current docs and thought it didn't work..
[14:38:37] <uGoMobi> but I had data-close-button instead of data-close-btn
