[07:13:36] <Wilto> Morning, gentlefolk.
[08:34:21] <toddparker> morning all
[08:35:03] <gseguin> howdy
[08:36:53] <Wilto> I don’t know what kind of unprofessional hoodlum got ahold of my phone over the weekend, but I sure am glad to have it back.
[09:52:04] <johnbender> Wilto: is there an open issue for changing the 9999px hack to the boilerplate version?
[10:08:44] <toddparker> not sure if there is
[10:08:53] <toddparker> that seems like a good thing for 1.2
[10:09:02] <toddparker> worried that will break somewhere potentially

[10:27:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] 2 issues here: first, the string for Opera Mobile is "Opera Mobi". Second, there was a typo in omversion. - scottjehl

[11:52:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] internally, we only use getScreenHeight during transitions, but it's exposed on $.mobile as well. For a while, it's been returning incorrect values in iOS, as it wasn't taking into account the browser chrome's footer height. window.innerHeight tends to return the value we need more consistently, but it's not supported in older browsers so I've included the jQuery height call as a fallback too. - scottjehl
[12:05:08] <johnbender> scottjehl: I'm guessing based on that commit I should use getScreenHeight for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/15b1ce672f13c6676358fa08e86e2900d51d6017
[12:05:09] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by johnbender (3d, 20h ago): when the loader is below the screen height move it up, also unbind the checkLoaderPosition to speed up scrolling

[12:06:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] whitespace and module name - John Bender
[12:30:22] <Wilto> johnbender: No issue open, as far as I know.
[12:30:45] <Wilto> johnbender: Just something I think we’ve been kicking around. I’ll open one now, and point to that h5bp thread.
[12:32:10] <Wilto> But I did do some experimenting with that approach on my own, and it’s looking really promising. I think it’ll be a relatively easy transition.
[12:32:49] <Wilto> Oh, wait, you opened one.
[12:45:42] <johnbender> Wilto: :D
[12:46:07] <Wilto> MY WORK HERE IS DONE

[13:01:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] when the loader is below the screen height move it up, also unbind the checkLoaderPosition to speed up scrolling - John Bender
[13:01:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] switch to mobile screenheight helper Fixes #3786 - John Bender
[13:47:24] <johnbender> tbenzige: is your github handle the same as your irc handle?
[13:51:46] <Wilto> Is GitHub still acting up?
[13:57:25] <johnbender> Wilto: in what capacity I'm using it right now
[13:57:50] <Wilto> Pushed a fix like ten minutes ago; no sign of it anywhere.
[13:58:06] <johnbender> Wilto: :(
[13:58:11] <johnbender> that's not good
[13:58:13] <johnbender> did it bork?
[13:58:15] <toddparker> i'm going to be traveling to LA so i'll be out of the loop tomorrow
[13:58:19] <toddparker> be back wednesday
[13:58:21] <Wilto> I mean, it’s not the fix I’m worried about, so much as the existential crisis brought on by the idea of GitHub not being there for me.
[13:58:23] <Wilto> I might cry.
[13:58:45] <johnbender> Wilto: what's the sha?
[13:58:46] <toddparker> johnbender: i am going to go to umami burger tomorrow probably around 6 or 7
[13:58:55] <johnbender> toddparker: ah cool!
[13:58:58] <toddparker> hit me if you think you could grab a bite!
[13:58:58] <johnbender> in SM?
[13:59:01] <toddparker> ya
[13:59:14] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll see, my mom gets into town tomorrow afternoon but it's not impossible
[13:59:22] <johnbender> I'm sure she'd appreciate a burger if brought one back for her
[13:59:27] <johnbender> :D
[13:59:42] <Wilto> …Something is amiss. Hold that thought, johnbender; I’m looking into it.
[13:59:57] <toddparker> no pressure
[14:01:10] <toddparker> just meal or tweet if you can
[14:01:31] <Wilto> Sounds like the worst game show ever.
[14:01:38] <Wilto> Meal or Tweet!™
[14:11:28] <johnbender> toddparker: will do
[14:18:33] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/tdpfFQ
[14:18:33] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #3837 - Ensures that absolute positioned checkboxes and radios within controlgroups are visible in IE7. - Mat Marquis
[14:18:38] <Wilto> Theeere we go.
[14:19:14] <Wilto> I had a “detached HEAD?”
[14:20:57] <Wilto> Makes a lot of sense as a metaphor, but beyond that I’m lost.
[14:22:39] <gseguin> Wilto: in the middle of a rebase?
[14:22:58] <Wilto> Not that I know of.
[14:23:17] <gseguin> hmm are you still in a detached head?
[14:23:26] <Wilto> Maybe that super unprofessional guy that stole my phone and by association Twitter account on St. Pat’s is responsible.
[14:23:43] <gseguin> :)
[14:23:49] <Wilto> Nope, just checked out master and I’m golden.
[14:23:55] <Wilto> Had to reapply my changes, but no big.
[14:25:54] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: PSA - don't use a jQuery Mobile 1.0.x theme with 1.1 JS. When 1.1 final releases, we'll support that in ThemeRoller w/upgrade tool too ★ http://bit.ly/FQ7XzP
[14:43:21] <johnbender> Wilto: rebase + conflict is one cause
[14:43:32] <johnbender> Wilto: git checkout <some ref>
[14:43:41] <johnbender> puts you into a detached head state too
[14:43:44] <johnbender> err
[14:43:51] <johnbender> when <some ref> isn't a branch
[15:31:00] <Wilto> Oh, maybe I typo’d a checkout, then.
[17:47:05] <maxlynch> Someone asked me about replacing divs for header/footer/etc. with HTML5 header/footer/etc.. is this supported, and would it mess with device compatibility (has it been tested at all)? I don't see any reference to it in the docs
[23:15:52] <johnbender> maxlynch: we've considered it but it's not supported by all devices (wp 7) so we'd have to add shims
[23:16:36] <johnbender> maxlynch: also, we'd still probably include the data-role to denote elements "owned" by jquery mobile at enhance time
[23:16:45] <johnbender> otherwise there would be ambiguity
[23:17:02] <johnbender> but I'm speaking in likelyhoods there
[23:17:10] <johnbender> it's something we've talked about
