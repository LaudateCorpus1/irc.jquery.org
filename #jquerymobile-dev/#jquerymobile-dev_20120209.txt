[07:49:17] <toddmparker_> hey - did you pick those commits over?
[08:16:55] <Wilto> As we speak. One sec
[08:19:36] <Wilto> Couple of conflicts in the last one.
[08:24:59] <Wilto> Is there supposed to be placeholder copy in bars-fixed.html?

[09:08:31] <Wilto> I dunno what time it is over in the UK, but I think a “tea time” jumps off like hourly.

[10:53:42] <gseguin> I'm guessing no meeting today, is there?
[10:54:52] <gseguin> toddmparker_, Wilto, johnbender, kinblas: ^
[10:55:17] <Wilto> Hey, meeting is cool with me, if you guys have anything you wanna go over.
[10:55:25] <Wilto> Todd’s out of town, but I’m on call.
[10:55:33] <kinblas> Wilto: I got nothing
[10:55:58] <gseguin> same here not much to say, I'm writing a test for a bug that a coworker reported
[10:56:30] <kinblas> Wilto: Also, I'm not sure when John gets here ( SF) but he was supposed to be traveling this morning for a 1pm meeting
[10:58:38] <gseguin> Wilto: did you see that comment: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/df6762db2284588beefbd5f4add32e7172c16de5#commitcomment-950685
[10:58:39] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Wilto (2h, 23m ago): Added mini feature to api ref, options tab, button pages.
[10:59:24] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/df6762db2284588beefbd5f4add32e7172c16de5/css/structure/jquery.mobile.core.css#L48
[10:59:30] <Wilto> Jesus. First a trailing comma, now a typo in my CSS.
[10:59:51] <Wilto> —Wait, actually, this may be old.
[11:02:30] <_|Nix|_> Hey, so, if there's no meeting, just wanted to let you guys know that we now have a popup with arrows in web-ui-fw: http://web-ui-fw.github.com/index.html#popupwindow-demo and that it's implemented as Todd suggested, i.e., as a separate widget that uses popupwindow.
[11:03:17] <_|Nix|_> Also, it's implemented in an ugly way, because I couldn't inherit from popup, because of issue #3544
[11:07:19] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: so you're saying that with jquery-ui's widget factory from 1.9m5 it works?
[11:08:53] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It works.
[11:09:07] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I checked, and they re-implemented $.extend ...
[11:09:11] <gseguin> did you test with 1.9m6 ?
[11:09:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: They have $.widget.extend ...
[11:09:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: No.
[11:09:23] <_|Nix|_> BUt I can, real quick ...
[11:11:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Works.
[11:12:35] <gseguin> ok I gotta look at the diff between our current version and
[11:12:52] <gseguin> then see if anybody is opposed to upgrade
[11:13:12] <gseguin> if tests stay green with it of course
[11:13:51] <_|Nix|_> Alright.
[11:14:49] <_|Nix|_> In other news, I've also been working on making options work on-the-fly: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/jqm/tests/functional/option-test.html
[11:15:27] <_|Nix|_> I got the slider to apply its theme and trackTheme on-the-fly, but the select-based slider is a bit more complicated.
[11:18:07] <gseguin> is that in a pull request somewhere?
[11:18:37] <_|Nix|_> I've also updated my PR for johnbender (#3504) ... it basically adds a "demultiplexer" to $.mobile.widget: In _setOption, $.mobile.widget checks if the widget has a _setOptionName function, and if so, it calls that, otherwise it chains up to $.Widget. Thus, to get on-the-fly properties for any widget, you need only add the key foo to options, and write a function called _setFoo for your widget, and voilà ...
[11:19:30] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It's not in a PR yet, because it's sort of beyond the scope of #3504, but it depends on #3504 ...
[11:20:34] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I guess I got myself started with the "disabled" option, but the solution could make all options work on-the-fly.
[11:20:35] <gseguin> ok
[11:20:55] <gseguin> I'm for that
[11:21:11] <gseguin> if it can be automated, it should be automated
[11:23:58] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: johnbender gave it a thorough look, and there's quite a bit to work out, and by actually going for implementing on-the-fly option setting across the board, the solutions should sorta become obvious ...

[12:26:05] <Wilto> Alright, I’m just gonna start knocking out various and sundry bugs for 1.1
[12:26:15] <Wilto> Anyone got anything specific they wanna point me at, before I dive in?
[12:42:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #455: SUCCESS in 27 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/455/
[12:43:10] <Wilto> Actually, switching back to the builder.
[12:43:17] <Wilto> All clear to work on that, gseguin?
[13:03:27] <gseguin> github is down! NOOooooo
[13:03:33] <gseguin> http://wil.to/_/panic.gif
[13:04:01] <gseguin> Wilto: I was going to point you at a branch of the amd-builder for you to review the API changes
[13:05:12] <Wilto> Oh, I saw that they’re uh path-ier now.
[13:05:31] <Wilto> Already got that sorted. Anything else major change?
[13:07:00] <gseguin> Wilto I'm trying to make it so it can serve other projects, maybe over-engineering... feedback is welcome
[13:07:29] <gseguin> Wilto: there it is: https://github.com/gseguin/node-amd-builder/tree/project-repo
[13:08:11] <gseguin> look at the README, let me know if you see anything you don't like or think is going to cause a problem
[13:08:26] <gseguin> if that's cool with you I'll land it shortly
[13:08:31] <gseguin> on master
[13:09:27] <Wilto> Doesn’t look like it makes much change to my stuff. I say go for it.
[13:12:36] <gseguin> awright
[14:51:51] <Wilto> gseguin: I’m guessing there’s no quick way to sort the dependency JSON by “group” on the server side, is there?
[15:01:53] * gseguin thinks
[15:03:14] <gseguin> Wilto: isn't it easy enough to do it on the client side?

[17:33:26] <gseguin> lets move one to the next project
[17:33:37] <gseguin> s/one/on/
[17:34:06] <gseguin> maybe github's parsing engine is off
[17:34:22] <gseguin> it's looking for an issue id after "Fixed"
[17:34:22] <Wilto> Strange. Ah well.
