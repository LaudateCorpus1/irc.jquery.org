[03:00:20] <uGoMobi> hi guys, hows the conference?
[08:37:18] <agcolom> Hi, timezone is not helping this week,
[08:37:36] <agcolom> Anyone around???
[08:37:50] <agcolom> gseguin?
[08:41:04] <agcolom> The 2 commits: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/244bf6d296afdc1a9465a378615e08a34bdd1683
[08:41:05] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Anne-Gaelle Colom (2d, 3h ago): updated demo code to 1.1.1-rc.1
[08:41:14] <toddmparker_> hi all
[08:41:36] <agcolom> And https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/bb8593e6fc0a1acea2f67d0ba1d5129ad3a76cfc
[08:41:37] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Anne-Gaelle Colom (2d, 3h ago): updated 2nd paragraph example to 1.1.1-rc.1
[08:41:49] <agcolom> Hey toddmparker_
[08:41:57] <agcolom> how is it going?
[08:42:16] <toddmparker_> good agcolom
[08:42:18] <agcolom> I'm on the train over 3G on my iPad!
[08:42:40] <agcolom> Shame you couldn't do demos...
[08:42:49] <toddmparker_> yeah, no time
[08:43:04] <toddmparker_> showed screenshots of the popup demos
[08:43:18] <agcolom> Excellent !!!!
[08:43:44] <agcolom> good to show at least what it looms like :-)
[08:43:49] <agcolom> Looks
[08:44:33] <agcolom> I love the new look of the api docs! Much nicer!
[08:45:15] <toddmparker_> https://speakerdeck.com/u/toddparker/p/jquery-mobile-san-francisco-conference-keynote
[08:45:30] <toddmparker_> seriously
[08:47:30] <toddmparker_> does that link work
[08:47:44] <agcolom> Nice!!!!
[08:47:54] <agcolom> yes all works :-)
[08:48:49] <agcolom> My late 2 docs commits didn't get tagged for 1.1.1-rc.1 so we have 2 pages still saying 1.1.0 :-(
[08:49:24] <agcolom> Getting off the train... Catch you later....
[09:47:14] <agcolom> and I am back online...
[09:50:47] <agcolom> toddmparker_, I think the code in the api docs is getting the highlighting now because <code><pre> was changed to <pre><code> but it looks lovely. I need to test the iframe on various devices, to see whether that works everywhere, and then need to add the code of the iframes on github, possibly in a separate folder... and then we could again have a folder per widget...

[10:21:12] <toddmparker_> agcolom: great
[10:23:25] <toddmparker_> you're up to 8 widgets. nice!
[10:24:06] <toddmparker_> the thing that is going to be most important (and time consuming) is documenting all the non-widget scripts - nav, degradeinputs, etc.
[10:53:56] <agcolom> toddmparker_ actually only 7. the search input is only a copy of checkbox for now!
[10:58:59] <toddmparker_> ah, gotcha. still, good progress.
[10:59:51] <MauriceG> Hi all, hi Todd!  Sorry for delay - mail on the way ...

[11:28:24] <gseguin> Hello folks!
[11:28:33] <agcolom> hello!
[11:28:36] <gseguin> toddmparker_: where are you?
[11:28:51] <gseguin> hey Anne
[11:28:51] <MauriceG> Hi gseguin !
[11:28:58] <gseguin> hi MauriceG
[11:28:58] <agcolom> did you see my message (2 commits missing from 1.1.1-rc.1)
[11:29:15] <gseguin> agcolom: I saw I paged Bender about it
[11:29:22] <gseguin> let me check
[11:29:29] <agcolom> Is it too late?
[11:29:55] <gseguin> it's too late for 1.1.1-RC1
[11:30:35] <agcolom> How are we creating the next one? From 1.1-stable or from master?
[11:30:50] <gseguin> but it can make it into RC2 or final
[11:31:04] <gseguin> 1.1-stable
[11:31:27] <agcolom> it'll have to be changed again to match the new tag/version, but now I have a checklist!
[11:32:00] <toddmparker_> gseguin - i'm 3rd row from the back, right in the middle
[11:32:28] <agcolom> send me some pictures!!!
[11:32:29] <toddmparker_> agcolom - we'll get those into the final for sure, like gseguin said
[11:32:43] <gseguin> toddmparker_: spotted you
[11:33:02] <gseguin> agcolom: which commits do you think did not make it?
[11:33:19] <agcolom> The 2 commits: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/244bf6d296afdc1a9465a378615e08a34bdd1683
[11:33:20] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Anne-Gaelle Colom (2d, 6h ago): updated demo code to 1.1.1-rc.1
[11:33:31] <agcolom> And https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/bb8593e6fc0a1acea2f67d0ba1d5129ad3a76cfc
[11:33:31] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Anne-Gaelle Colom (2d, 6h ago): updated 2nd paragraph example to 1.1.1-rc.1
[11:33:33] <gseguin> Everything here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/1.1-stable
[11:33:42] <gseguin> is is in 1.1.1-rc.1
[11:34:26] <gseguin> agcolom: it should be in
[11:34:51] <agcolom> no, look http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1-rc.1/docs/about/getting-started.html
[11:35:20] <agcolom> it is in 1.1-stable but not in 1.1.1-rc.1
[11:36:33] <agcolom> I think when johnbender retagged yesterday, I've got the feeling it was only 1 commit... but I may be wrong...
[11:38:33] <gseguin> the tag is pointing at the ebd173c31e
[11:38:51] <gseguin> so it could just be that it did not get deployed
[11:40:17] <agcolom> ah is that good? yes, I've checked your message and it was that the latest one was the latest: ebd173c31e0ac487e41215422db213eb9497b09d so we should be ok
[11:41:03] <gseguin> johnbender: are you around?
[13:02:23] <agcolom> gseguin, johnbender, if I want to make changes that need to be cherry-picked into the next release, do i cherry-pick into 1.1-stable or so I make the changes in master and keep a note of what needs to be cherry-picked, and do the cherry-picking later (when we know where the cherry-picking will go?)
[13:02:53] <agcolom> sorry I meant or do I make the changes in master and keep a note of what needs to be cherry-picked, and do the cherry-picking later (when we know where the cherry-picking will go?)
[13:03:01] <agcolom> (instead of so!)
[13:56:55] <agcolom> maxlynch??
[13:59:01] <maxlynch> agcolom: yes?
[13:59:51] <agcolom> Hi, I'm adding my recipes to your doc. Is that the right thing to do?
[14:01:23] <maxlynch> yea perfect, thanks :)
[14:01:58] <agcolom> I did have some asciidoc formatting (probably not everywhere). Is it ok to leave that in?
[14:02:25] <agcolom> (I can remove it if that's easier for you)
[14:04:37] <agcolom> And I have authorizations for all the pictures. I just need to mention the author for one of them (I've got that in writing). Do you need the email for that one? (that authorizes me to use the picture)
[14:09:04] <maxlynch> um, sure I'll take the email, and you can leave it in asciidoc
[14:09:14] <maxlynch> since we have to do that anyways, and you probably know it better than I do :)
[14:10:44] <agcolom> euh not really! I just had a look at the intructions at the time... Hope I did it right ;-) email on its way...
[14:15:18] <maxlynch> thanks
[14:15:58] <agcolom> maxlynch: I've sent you 2 emails: my email to request authorization and the email granting authorization as this one was not a direct reply to my initial one.
[14:22:01] <maxlynch> agcolom: cool, thanks!
[14:37:13] <agcolom> maxlynch: all done :-)
[14:53:22] <toddmparker_> hi, i'm back
[14:55:44] <agcolom> Hey!
[14:56:18] <agcolom> I've put the date of the JQuery UK conference in my diary!
[15:02:20] <toddmparker_> cool
[15:02:23] <toddmparker_> when is it?
[15:02:32] <agcolom> 13th April
[15:02:51] <agcolom> Less risky with the weather :-)
[15:03:19] <agcolom> (I took the date from Ralph's note!)
[15:03:38] <agcolom> So I hope it's correct. It's a saturday
[15:07:15] <agcolom> devswag needs to make jQuery Mobile t-shirts! http://www.devswag.com/collections/jquery
[15:15:49] <gseguin> Yup they do
[15:20:58] <agcolom> ok guys... I think it's bed time for me...
[15:29:33] <gseguin> good night Anne
[15:30:03] <agcolom> goodnight Ghislain, Have  a great time and hope all goes well for johnbender's talk.
[15:34:41] <agcolom> Goodnight toddmparker_ and have  a safe journey... I'm still impressed by the plane with wifi!
[15:34:55] <toddmparker_> goodnight
[15:35:02] <toddmparker_> agcolom
[15:35:10] <toddmparker_> we need a "logo"
[15:35:14] <toddmparker_> sigh.
[15:35:46] <agcolom> yes, I agree. Who's a good graphic artist in the team?
[15:41:23] <maxlynch> toddmparker_: I know we're not really in the "team" but I bet I could get ben to make one...
[15:42:03] <toddmparker_> hey maxlynch - i'm looking for ideas on a mark for mobile
[15:42:10] <toddmparker_> i tried and failed long ago
[15:42:15] <toddmparker_> but we do need one
[15:42:40] <toddmparker_> if ben wants to throw out some sketches, that would be great
[15:42:42] <maxlynch> Sure. Well I bet he'd be willing to try, even if you don't use it
[15:42:46] <maxlynch> sure, I bet he'd love that actually
[15:42:58] <toddmparker_> as is the case with logos, that's always a possibility
[15:43:00] <toddmparker_> cool
[15:43:05] <toddmparker_> you guys rock
[15:43:34] <toddmparker_> btw - i spoke to tyler yesterday and he's working on writing up what we need to do for the 1.1.1 upgrade and/or a shell script to do the grunt work
[15:43:40] <maxlynch> toddmparker_: :) cool
[15:44:28] <maxlynch> Well I'll be around so just let me know what needs to be done and I'll do it
[15:44:34] <toddmparker_> ok, thanks
[15:44:41] <toddmparker_> it'll be next week
[15:44:51] <maxlynch> sounds great
[15:47:08] <toddmparker_> i just emailed tyler and you to kick that off
[15:48:42] <maxlynch> toddmparker_: I just asked ben and he is very interested in try to make a logo. Maybe you two should talk over email about what you're looking for?
[15:59:37] <toddmparker_> sure
[16:01:15] <agcolom> toddmparker_ Just had an idea... I'm sending you an email
[16:04:08] <agcolom> toddmparker_ that's a first attempt! Sorry if it's not at all what you're after :-)
[16:15:56] <toddmparker_> thanks agcolom!
[16:16:12] <toddmparker_> i really appreciate the help.
[16:16:23] <toddmparker_> i think we need something less cellphone-like
[16:17:01] <agcolom> my pleasure :-) I just need to learn how to use photoshop! Yes, I think this one may be a bit too obvious...
[16:19:14] <toddmparker_> i've been through a lot of iterations and sort of gave up
[16:19:31] <toddmparker_> maxlynch: i emailed ben with a brief
[16:19:36] <agcolom> well these things are not easy!
[16:19:37] <toddmparker_> lemme know if you don't see it
[16:19:51] <toddmparker_> agcolom: you're right. logos are the hardest thing.
[16:20:26] <agcolom> it needs to scale well as well (for favicon and a small version is needed for the api docs tab
[16:20:52] <maxlynch> toddmparker_: got it, cool
[16:20:54] <agcolom> and it needs to look great on t-shirts too ;-)
[16:23:05] <agcolom> Also, it's a bit like a tatoo... you need to really like and be very sure because you can't really change it afterwards!
[16:23:51] <toddmparker_> schwag = key
[16:25:04] <agcolom> that's a new word for me!
[16:27:09] <toddmparker_> :)
[16:27:16] <agcolom> ok, it really passed my bedtime hour! goodnight again, and enjoy the rest of you evening... Feel free to upload pictures to baseamp
[16:27:45] <agcolom> for the poor people in Europe :)
