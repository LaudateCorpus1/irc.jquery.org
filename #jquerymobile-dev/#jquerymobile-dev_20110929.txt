[07:15:38] <toddparker> hi all
[07:23:02] <gnarf> hey toddparker
[07:41:51] <toddparker> hey gnarf
[07:42:18] <toddparker> how goes?
[07:42:29] <gnarf> good, Dave just squashed the first bug in 1.7b1 :)
[07:43:30] <toddparker> woo hoo
[07:43:42] <toddparker> we're going to have to drop that in once RC1 goes out today
[07:43:51] <toddparker> *fingers crossed*
[08:22:54] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #93: SUCCESS in 16 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/93/
[08:22:54] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: updated forms nav links
[08:22:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: corrected the nav "on" state
[08:57:45] <kinblas> scottjehl: toddparker: how are things looking?
[09:06:00] <scottjehl> hey kinblas
[09:06:06] <scottjehl> good - what are you up to?
[09:07:50] <kinblas> I'm looking into a form submit bug
[09:08:09] <kinblas> was also thinking of transferring the transitions plugin documentation from the wiki to the docs?
[09:08:19] <kinblas> but that can happen for rc2 I guess
[09:08:29] * kinblas looks at the rc1 list for today
[09:10:07] <kinblas> scottjehl: I still need to look into the manifest problems dan was seeing
[09:10:20] <scottjehl> ok yeah
[09:10:34] <kinblas> scottjehl: what are you guys up to? I don't know if its just me .. but things seem a little too calm :-)
[09:10:52] <scottjehl> well, we've got 2 days to put together slides for saturday's keynote
[09:10:57] <scottjehl> so that's what I'm doing
[09:11:22] <kinblas> scottjehl: everything is being video taped eh?
[09:11:28] * kinblas wishes he were there
[09:11:44] <scottjehl> not sure if it will be
[09:11:50] <scottjehl> yeah... wish you could be here too!
[09:12:34] <kinblas> we need a t-shirt for the team ... maybe one that re-laysout the content based on shirt size
[09:13:22] <kinblas> a responsive designed t-shirt
[09:13:36] <kinblas> scottjehl: so what's the dealio with the source builder?
[09:14:01] <scottjehl> that's hilarious
[09:14:11] <scottjehl> umm. not happening this week
[09:14:40] <scottjehl> If you're able to chip in on the dependency hash, that'd be great, but we'll need to aim for 1.0 final
[09:18:46] <kinblas> scottjehl: ok, maybe after we ship today ... so what JSON PHP module were you thinking of using?
[09:19:28] <scottjehl> ? :)
[09:19:28] <bot-t> :)
[09:19:30] <kinblas> scottjehl: hmmm 5.2 has it built in
[09:19:41] <kinblas> man we need to get off 5.1 here
[09:21:05] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #94: FAILURE in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/94/
[09:21:06] <jqm-jenkins-bot> maggie: removed plugin events and methods page from nav (keeping it in the directory to redirect)
[09:27:01] <toddparker> kin - the new docs additional look great!
[09:27:13] <kinblas> toddparker: thanks, I was running on fumes lastnight
[09:27:26] <kinblas> so hopefully it makes sense
[09:27:59] <kinblas> toddparker: are we meeting at 11am PST (2pm other time zone)?
[09:28:12] <kinblas> or are we punting due to release?
[09:29:51] <toddparker> hmmm
[09:29:56] <toddparker> think we should punt
[09:30:03] <toddparker> we're talking here :)
[09:30:35] <toddparker> kin - ar eyou still documenting?
[09:30:54] <toddparker> this one bug would be worth looking into: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2541
[09:31:05] <toddparker> assigned to bender, but he's not around from what i can see
[09:31:19] <toddparker> if not, going to move this to rc2
[09:31:20] <kinblas> toddparker: actually I'm on a mission to prove that form submit bug is an IE bug
[09:31:46] <toddparker> #2001?
[09:31:48] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2001
[09:31:49] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah
[09:31:54] <toddparker> cool
[09:32:00] <toddparker> that's the only other rc1 issue
[09:32:02] <kinblas> toddparker: just rewriting the sample with no jquery
[09:32:06] <scottjehl> kinblas - IE submit was mentioned in the jQuery 1.7 beta notes
[09:32:07] <toddparker> try ingot be realistic
[09:32:10] <scottjehl> not sure if the'll help
[09:32:18] <toddparker> like that we've actually checked off everything in RC1 (or moved it)
[09:32:21] <kinblas> oh was it?
[09:32:31] <toddparker> didn't move that yet
[09:32:36] <scottjehl> yeah. diff way to work around their lack of form event bubbling
[09:32:42] <toddparker> but if we can't get to these last 2, i'll move e'em to rc2
[09:32:47] <toddparker> i see
[09:32:57] <toddparker> you could drop in 1.7 to test it
[09:33:17] <toddparker> we're not going to do that for real today, but we could note this as the fix and move this to rc2
[09:33:25] <toddparker> we can switch to 1.7 tomorrow
[09:35:48] <toddparker> kinblas - is tyler in today?
[09:36:17] <kinblas> toddparker: not sure, he's supposed to be M/W/F but he's been adjusting for start of school
[09:36:23] <toddparker> ah
[09:36:32] <kinblas> why what's up?
[09:36:36] <kinblas> anything I can help with?
[09:36:48] <toddparker> i don't have a good handle on his schedule
[09:36:48] <toddparker> what's adobe's plans for announcing TR?
[09:37:00] <toddparker> I'm going to shoot a video today based on where we are for the conf
[09:37:21] <toddparker> but how much pressure to launch on a certain day?
[09:50:55] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm not sure if there's pressure on our side to ship on a certain date ... I'll get back to you on that ... my impression was that we want to be able to show it and let folks know we're serious about trying to help the mobile project
[09:55:43] <kinblas> toddparker: so are we not going to have TR up somewhere for jQCon?
[09:55:51] <kinblas> for folks to play with?
[09:59:50] <toddparker> i'm not confident that tyler will have all the bugs worked out by tomorrowâ€¦do you?
[10:02:23] <toddparker> i just refreshed and saw he got a lot of fixes in last night
[10:02:44] <toddparker> but i don't wantot distribute a dev URL, it needs to be staged up not eh real servers
[10:02:48] <toddparker> always fun
[10:02:59] <toddparker> at the conf, we'll have a video
[10:03:10] <toddparker> and I can live demo if i have a connection
[10:03:56] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: ew I just took a peek in jquery.js and we're faking submits
[10:04:14] <kinblas> when someone bnds to submit they are really binding to click on submit buttons/images
[10:04:17] <scottjehl> say wha?
[10:04:34] <kinblas> that's only when submitBubbles is false
[10:05:04] * kinblas looks at jquery HEAD
[10:05:49] <scottjehl> oh... huh.
[10:06:19] <scottjehl> since we're not standardizing on 1.7 yet, should we "fix" this too?
[10:06:45] <kinblas> fix?
[10:07:03] <scottjehl> well, there's an issue right? People can't bind to submit events in IE?
[10:07:37] <kinblas> scottjehl: the head seems to do a different approach
[10:12:54] <scottjehl> k.
[10:13:09] <scottjehl> hey Kin, where were the issues with vclick in the end?
[10:13:14] <scottjehl> android-only?
[10:13:45] <scottjehl> I guess I"m unclear on why we can use v events at all, but can't use them for navigation...
[10:13:57] <scottjehl> unclear as in... I've forgotten the reasoning
[10:14:03] <scottjehl> kinblas ^
[10:17:02] <kinblas> scottjehl: the original reasoning was so that folks didn't have to care about touch or mouse based events ... remember our components used to register for both and do some "if triggered by touch don't do this" type stuff
[10:17:43] <kinblas> scottjehl: but what we've discovered in the process is that this doesn't work very well in situations where content is changed underneath the point of touch between the touchend and the mouse events are dispatched
[10:18:11] <scottjehl> right. but I mean, we use vclick and such in our widgets, but not for navigation.
[10:18:13] <kinblas> add to that the fact that some device heuristics for calculating the target of the synthesized mouse events is wonky at best
[10:18:42] <scottjehl> is that because when it fails, it doesn't go anywhere?
[10:18:57] <kinblas> scottjehl :we use it for instant feedback on navigation, but yeah we can't fire the actual navigation action on vclick because the navigation moves content
[10:19:20] <scottjehl> but so do other things.. slider, collapsible, etc
[10:19:28] <scottjehl> those use v events
[10:19:51] <kinblas> scottjehl: but sliders don't really change content out from underneath you
[10:19:54] <scottjehl> but they're safer. is that because a misclick doesn't go anywhere? href="#"..
[10:20:10] <kinblas> scottjehl: the underlying problem is this
[10:20:23] <kinblas> if we change the the content out from underneath the point touched
[10:20:30] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #95: STILL FAILING in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/95/
[10:20:31] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Updated the $.mobile.loadPage() sample in the pre-fetch section so that it passes in the showLoadMsg:false option to prevent the ajax loading message from popping up.
[10:20:31] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: added to repo
[10:20:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: added nav bar and updated content (now includes a nav bar for options, methods, and events pages)
[10:20:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: added note style
[10:20:33] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: simplified language
[10:20:33] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: fixed broken links
[10:20:37] <kinblas> the targets of the touch events are *DIFFERENT* from the targets of the synthesized mouse events
[10:21:05] <kinblas> this means we have to rely on coordinate based matching, which is wonky on some devices/OSs ... the worst being Android 2.1
[10:21:05] <scottjehl> wait. still confused. Didn't you make a change that keeps pages out of the viewport until they're shown? If so, wouldn't that eliminate the issues with vclick?
[10:21:25] <kinblas> scottjehl: no
[10:21:35] <scottjehl> also did iOS ever have vclick mismatch issues?
[10:21:42] <kinblas> I didn't land that change... that was for CSS 3 transitions
[10:21:54] <kinblas> iOS has by far, fewer mismatches
[10:21:59] <kinblas> the only time it is bad
[10:22:16] <kinblas> is if we swap out the content before the mouse events fire
[10:22:25] <kinblas> but then the coordinates in the touch and mouse events were
[10:22:34] <kinblas> close enough they would match/line up
[10:22:39] <kinblas> and we would kill the events
[10:22:47] <kinblas> like I said Android is the worst offender
[10:22:59] <kinblas> in some of my tests the coordinates fired for mouse events were 200px away
[10:23:04] <kinblas> no where near where I touched
[10:23:47] <scottjehl> k
[10:23:52] <scottjehl> so in the case of a mismatch...
[10:23:53] <kinblas> I don't know if I just confused you more
[10:24:03] <scottjehl> say I tap a listview link
[10:24:06] <kinblas> to me this has been one big exercise in frustration and disappointment
[10:24:41] <kinblas> scottjehl: ok, so I tap a listview link
[10:24:48] <scottjehl> k
[10:26:27] <kinblas> scottjehl: were you going to walk me through an example?
[10:26:52] <scottjehl> hah. I was waiting for you to continue
[10:26:54] <scottjehl> ok so
[10:27:00] <kinblas> heh
[10:27:01] <scottjehl> touchend fires on the link
[10:27:06] <kinblas> right
[10:27:09] <scottjehl> page change begins
[10:27:24] <kinblas> right
[10:27:31] <scottjehl> then mouse events fire... on another link beneath that link?
[10:27:39] <kinblas> right
[10:27:54] <kinblas> target for click will be whatever is underneath that point at the moment it is dispatched
[10:27:55] <scottjehl> so we could fix this by not stacking pages then?
[10:28:15] <kinblas> it still happens with slide
[10:28:42] <kinblas> scottjehl: this is the reason waiting till click fixes things
[10:28:44] <scottjehl> because the slide finishes and then mouse events fire at that x/y of the touch?
[10:28:48] <kinblas> the content does *NOT* move
[10:28:54] <kinblas> right
[10:29:22] <kinblas> scottjehl: right, sort of ... the x/y for the mouse events as I said earlier sometimes matches the touch event, sometimes not
[10:29:29] <kinblas> depends on browser implementation
[10:29:31] <scottjehl> what's the reason we couldn't cancel mosue events?
[10:29:58] <scottjehl> once a touch is in play, stop mouse listening entirely
[10:30:09] <kinblas> we do
[10:30:18] <kinblas> we register on both mouse and touch events
[10:30:23] <kinblas> mouse event listeners are disabled
[10:30:27] <kinblas> when touch is active
[10:30:39] <kinblas> the problem is touch is *NOT* active once the touchend goes up
[10:30:41] <scottjehl> right. so how do the mouse events affect anything?
[10:30:59] <kinblas> because things like click trigger default events of the elements they are fired on
[10:31:16] <kinblas> so what we try to do is catch click during the capture phase
[10:31:29] <scottjehl> so we can't enable disable a "return false" on click when touch is in play?
[10:31:43] <scottjehl> instead of disabling, actually bind to it to prevent default
[10:32:00] <kinblas> first
[10:32:11] <kinblas> we can't just blindly preventDefault() on every click
[10:32:33] <kinblas> it will break things ... so from vclick you must call preventDefault() to enable this click killing code
[10:32:35] <scottjehl> but we could if touch is in use for nav model
[10:32:48] <kinblas> we are already doing that
[10:32:58] <scottjehl> oh
[10:32:59] <kinblas> or we were when were using vclick as the nav trigger
[10:33:08] <kinblas> the big problem is this
[10:33:21] <kinblas> there is a delay between touchend and the mouse events
[10:33:28] <kinblas> there is also the problem
[10:33:42] <kinblas> that different platforms will sometimes not dispatch mouse events
[10:33:51] <kinblas> scottjehl: read this blog post of mine ...
[10:34:22] <kinblas> http://blogs.adobe.com/adobeandjquery/2011/03/07/the-current-state-of-touch-events/
[10:34:34] <scottjehl> I'm just wondering if we could just prevent default on a seemingly safe timeout when touchend is in use in the nav model
[10:35:19] <kinblas> scottjehl: you mean just blindly call preventDefault on whatever click comes our way within a certain time frame?
[10:35:47] <kinblas> ... I tried that ... but the problem is the user can tap 2 different things before the mouse events are dispatched for the first tap
[10:36:09] <scottjehl> yeah. assuming we're actively managing a vclick that is resulting in a page change
[10:36:24] <scottjehl> but then the touch events would fire on the second thing too, and we'd cancel the first page change and handle the new one anyway, no?
[10:37:09] <kinblas> heh we need a flow diagram
[10:39:52] <kinblas> scottjehl: so about the differences in form submit support in 1.7 and earlier versions
[10:40:51] <kinblas> it looks like in 1.7 they still look for clicks, but when the click handler is fired, they register a submit handler on the form ... in that handler, they get the parent of the form and then do a trigger submit to force it to bubble up.
[10:41:05] <kinblas> so yeah, it looks like 1.7 might solve our problems
[10:41:21] <gnarf> hey guys
[10:41:29] <kinblas> gnarf: hey
[10:41:56] <gnarf> so we are looking at switching from document.defaultView.getComputedStyle to just "getComputedStyle" in core
[10:41:59] * gnarf hunts for the pull
[10:42:08] <gnarf> just curious if anyone thinks it might cause issues in mobile
[10:42:16] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/4NWcY/ is a little reduced test case here
[10:42:40] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/524
[10:47:07] <kinblas> toddparker: are we still doing the team meeting?
[10:49:47] <scottjehl> gnarf to shave bytes or..? I'm not sure of the support for one or the other property
[10:50:21] <gnarf> scottjehl: i believe so - doesn't seem to change any functionality, although it might save a few property lookups - its targeted more at shaving
[10:51:08] <scottjehl> gnarf hmm ok. yeah not sure. I've seen plenty of scenarios where things like that do end up causing a platform to fail out though
[10:51:29] <scottjehl> like the window height|width scenario that we had to patch in core for Symbian
[10:51:37] <gnarf> scottjehl: can you think of any way to pro-actively test this? :)
[10:52:05] <scottjehl> well, we could test our platforms here but today is a release so we're pretty jammed up
[10:52:54] <toddparker> kinblas: no meeting
[10:52:56] <gnarf> roger, just wanted some mobile test coverage before we end up landing it
[10:53:14] <gnarf> i'd love it if one of you can take a look when you get a chance
[10:53:17] <gnarf> no rush
[10:53:25] <scottjehl> oh totally. are you running any mobile devices on testswarm?
[10:53:33] <gnarf> not yet AFAIK
[10:53:37] <gnarf> are any of you in boston tomorrow?
[10:53:44] <scottjehl> yep we live here :)
[10:53:50] <gnarf> we are having a testing/swarm meeting at the loft 3pmish
[10:53:59] <scottjehl> you're welcome to swing by Filament Group and test devices here
[10:54:06] <gnarf> scottjehl: where is filament?
[10:54:12] <scottjehl> we've got the jQM test lab ehre
[10:54:12] <gnarf> scottjehl: i'm hanging out at the loft
[10:54:13] <scottjehl> here
[10:54:20] <scottjehl> 102 South Street in Boston
[10:54:24] <scottjehl> near south station
[10:54:28] <gnarf> right on
[10:54:32] <gnarf> i actually know where south station is
[10:54:32] <gnarf> :)
[10:54:36] <scottjehl> nice
[10:54:38] <toddparker> kinblas: did you see this forum post: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/usability-touch-feedback-too-slow#14737000002757817
[10:54:56] <toddparker> touch feedback to oslow
[10:56:04] <toddparker> ^^ slow, not oslo
[10:56:43] <scottjehl> brb
[10:56:44] <gnarf> scottjehl: http://g.co/maps/ndxav ?
[10:57:56] <gnarf> that seems wrong
[10:58:06] <gnarf> the south station i'm thinking of is like right across the river from the loft
[11:04:05] <gnarf> http://g.co/maps/msczc ?
[11:07:25] <kinblas> toddparker: what buttons is he talking about?
[11:07:54] <kinblas> toddparker: if he's talking about nav buttons then yeah they are slower because we went back to click
[11:10:48] <kinblas> toddparker: funny thing is they are using tap which is implemented using vclick.
[11:18:21] <scottjehl> gnarf yep
[11:18:36] <gnarf> scottjehl: the second link right? :)
[11:18:52] <gnarf> i might head over that way a little later, danheberden was talking about going on a walk
[11:18:55] <scottjehl> gnarf yep for sure
[11:19:17] <gnarf> im still frantically writing slides tho
[11:20:53] <scottjehl> kinblas - we've had media classes deprecated for a while
[11:20:55] <scottjehl> remove?
[11:21:19] <scottjehl> remove from build that is
[11:21:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[11:21:21] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #96: FIXED in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/96/
[11:21:21] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: clarified blurb about how events are preserved for form buttons
[11:21:22] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: edit to form button description
[11:21:22] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * maggie: clarified intro text
[11:21:58] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah, get that download size down!
[11:22:29] <kinblas> scottjehl: are you guys going to move that stuff to the filamentgroup git repository?
[11:22:32] <kinblas> so its still available?
[11:23:16] <scottjehl> I was thinking keep it in the repo
[11:23:19] <gnarf> scottjehl: nvm btw about that testing - jdalton found a hole in FF3.6 apparently
[11:23:21] <scottjehl> just remove from make
[11:24:36] <kinblas> toddparker: I just updated issue 2001 with comments ... thanks to scottjehl for vending me a clue on 1.7 ... I'm moving the issue to RC2 when we switch to core 1.7.
[11:25:33] * kinblas moves on to 2541
[11:25:56] <scottjehl> kinblas - actually, we were thinking we might remove the file from the repo too, but keep a mention of it in the docs and have a link to the file in a previous commit. Thoughts?
[11:26:19] <scottjehl> so someone could grab its contents if they really needed it
[11:26:39] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah, but then they'd need a github account to do so
[11:27:05] <scottjehl> to view the raw JS on the github site?
[11:27:10] <scottjehl> think it's publica
[11:27:12] <scottjehl> public
[11:27:13] <kinblas> hmmm yeah nevermind
[11:27:14] <kinblas> :-)
[11:27:35] <gnarf> scottjehl: got a desk at filament you could loan me for a bit if i stop by, or should i just leave the laptop here? :)
[11:28:07] <scottjehl> oh sure! anytime - plenty of room here
[12:01:13] <scottjehl> kinblas - what the heck did we add to increase by 4kb since beta? this is weird...
[12:01:34] <scottjehl> even after removing media classes js from make, i'm seeing 24kb min/gz
[12:01:41] <kinblas> hmmm
[12:01:47] <kinblas> not sure
[12:01:54] <kinblas> wasn't me :-P
[12:02:11] <scottjehl> I just didn't think we really added much of anything...
[12:02:11] <kinblas> hang on let me do some comparisons real quick
[12:03:03] <scottjehl> oh. looks like our numbers were off on b3
[12:03:06] <scottjehl> 22.92
[12:04:04] <scottjehl> still though...
[12:04:28] <scottjehl> on the upside, core is 10kb now, almost 9.x
[12:04:36] <scottjehl> just not sure what was added
[12:06:46] <scottjehl> frankly, I would have expected removing this file would have decreased our size... https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/38d7ad8848f00b0921bf4ae723f3ad199eb851c1/js/jquery.mobile.media.classes.js
[12:06:48] <scottjehl> hh
[12:08:23] <kinblas> scottjehl: looks like several of the form related widgets grew slightly
[12:08:40] <kinblas> alot of the growth looks spread across all the files
[12:08:46] <kinblas> no major offenders
[12:08:51] <scottjehl> huh
[12:09:02] <gnarf> scottjehl: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/61277d2864b00c5206d0fdcefc67f7497663a012
[12:09:02] <kinblas> of course I'm looking at the non-minified files
[12:09:03] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by timmywil (1w, 2d ago): Landing pull request 511. Adding a little Makefile jQuery sizing utility to easily see differences in size between makes.  Fixes #10308.More Details: - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/511
[12:09:13] <scottjehl> well, the DL builder will address this of course
[12:11:29] <kinblas> scottjehl: navigation and pushstate each grew by 4k and 1k respectively
[12:11:31] * kinblas sighs
[12:11:41] <scottjehl> woh
[12:11:58] <scottjehl> hmm yet core dropped 1kb in min/gz
[12:12:06] * kinblas diffs
[12:12:07] <scottjehl> and that includes both of those files
[12:13:15] <scottjehl> oh, adding the overflow and fixed stuff for ios5 added lots
[12:13:53] <scottjehl> of course, moving forward people could choose to just remove the old fixed headers scripting and save about 200lines
[12:14:04] <kinblas> scottjehl: the navigation comparisons aren't a good one .. there's mostly comments added
[12:14:10] * kinblas does a min comparison
[12:14:32] <kinblas> scottjehl: plus I removed a big chuck of deprecated stuff
[12:14:38] <scottjehl> it's okay. I think it's mostly the ios5 additions. This will all matter very little once we have a DL builder in place
[12:14:53] <scottjehl> nobody should be including every widget
[12:14:55] <scottjehl> :)
[12:18:04] <Wilto> I include every widget, Scott. And three lightbox plugins, just in case.
[12:21:29] <scottjehl> Wilto are you on a plane because that doesn't count
[12:22:06] <Wilto> Oh, right, yes. Carry on, then!
[12:22:48] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #97: FAILURE in 15 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/97/
[12:22:48] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Updated supported platforms for RC1
[12:22:49] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: These orientation heights that were mainly tied to iOS are no longer needed, as viewport height is managed via JS
[12:22:49] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Updated dependencies in templates to point to 1.0rc1 and 1.6.4
[12:22:50] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: changed comment in JS
[12:22:50] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed media classes JS - deprecated since Beta 1. Use CSS3 Media Queries with a polyfill instead :) Docs are updated to link to old code in case anyone still needs a backwards-port
[12:22:51] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added reference to Respond.js polyfill for those using CSS3 Media Queries.
[12:22:51] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed media classes from make file, following up to previous commits
[12:24:47] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah so looking at the minified sizes the fixHeaderFooter*.js files went up 1k and navigation.js went up 1k too
[12:24:57] <scottjehl> k
[12:25:16] <kinblas> as well as init.js
[12:26:07] <Wilto> Gotta boltâ€”congrats on RC1, guys!
[12:29:56] <scottjehl> thanks for your help Wilto
[12:29:58] <scottjehl> talk soon
[12:55:02] <toddparker> kinblas: you around?
[12:56:06] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah
[12:58:30] <kinblas> todparker: ping?
[12:58:36] <kinblas> toddparker: ^^
[13:07:13] <toddparker> oh, hey
[13:07:27] <toddparker> just wanted to see if you had any last minute things
[13:07:35] <toddparker> or if you're all set for RC1
[13:07:46] <toddparker> kinblas ^^
[13:10:13] <kinblas> toddparker: I think we're set ... the disabling of some of those widgets is going to require some coding
[13:10:24] <kinblas> I don't think we want to check last minute stuff like that in
[13:10:39] <kinblas> ew
[13:18:32] <toddparker> agreed. ok, cool
[13:18:35] <toddparker> almost ready
[13:21:26] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #98: STILL FAILING in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/98/
[13:21:27] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Added RC1 banner image
[13:21:27] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: adjusted docs left column
[13:26:07] <toddparker> kinblas: failing?
[13:26:36] <kinblas> toddparker: what's failing the unit tests?
[13:26:48] <kinblas> John said there appears to be a problem with the ruby scripts
[13:26:52] <kinblas> the tests pass locally
[13:27:01] <toddparker> ^^
[13:27:46] <toddparker> what's that warning above kinblas
[13:28:27] <kinblas> toddparker: the error is "undefined method `include?' for nil:NilClass"
[13:30:04] <kinblas> scottjehl: is the media stuff you removed referenced from the unit tests?
[13:30:13] <scottjehl> I removed them too
[13:32:20] <kinblas> scottjehl: hmm, I just updated and didn't get any deletes, but the media tests are failing
[13:37:29] <scottjehl> kinblas https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a93c4878aae75ea6c4a9ee6a7adbe759510b26d0
[13:37:29] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery-mobile by scottjehl (1h, 50m ago): removed media classes JS - deprecated since Beta 1. Use CSS3 Media Queries with a polyfill instead :) Docs are updated to link to old code in case anyone still needs a backwards-port
[13:39:17] <scottjehl> kinblas can you reset to origin master maybe?
[13:39:30] <scottjehl> not sure what's up
[13:39:45] <kinblas> I am pointing at origin master
[13:39:59] * kinblas tries running off of /test/tests/unit/
[13:41:22] <scottjehl> http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/unit/media/
[13:41:24] <kinblas> scottjehl: hmmm it was a caching problem
[13:41:24] <scottjehl> looks good to me
[13:41:43] <kinblas> I had to visit the test directly and force reload
[13:42:00] <kinblas> scottjehl: sorry for the false alarm :-)
[13:44:40] <toddparker> kinblas: can you pull and see if the platforms page says RC1
[13:44:43] <toddparker> not beta 3
[13:46:27] <scottjehl> kinblas no probs
[13:46:28] <kinblas> where is said platforms page?
[13:46:31] <toddparker> anyone know how to refresh /test/
[13:46:35] <toddparker> seems jamemd
[13:46:46] <toddparker> this says beta 3
[13:46:48] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/platforms.html
[13:46:52] <toddparker> but if you pull, it's correct
[13:48:30] <toddparker> kinblas: you seeing that issue on test?
[13:48:41] <gseguin> no issue here
[13:48:53] <toddparker> it says RC1
[13:49:01] <toddparker> gseguin ^^
[13:49:04] <gseguin> oh sorry just read the last line
[13:49:06] <kinblas_> toddparker: I forced a reload and it says RC1
[13:49:20] <gseguin> yeah no, it says Beta 3
[13:49:29] <toddparker> what the...
[13:49:32] <kinblas_> toddparker: I see 1.0 RC1
[13:49:34] <toddparker> i think it's behind
[13:49:39] <kinblas_> in the upper right corner right?
[13:49:40] <toddparker> if you pull, do you see it locally?
[13:50:00] <toddparker> no, front eh homepage, click on "supported platforms"
[13:50:07] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/platforms.html
[13:50:11] <toddparker> or click ^^
[13:50:32] <kinblas_> toddparker: I see an updated image in my source
[13:50:34] <gseguin> yeah test doesn't have latest
[13:50:38] <gnarf> toddparker lemme know if you want me to change the topic in #jquery to point to RC1 :)
[13:50:39] <toddparker> right, ok
[13:50:48] <toddparker> sure, thanks gnarf
[13:50:58] <toddparker> so who can un-jam test?
[13:51:07] <gseguin> eddiemonge ?
[13:51:16] <toddparker> yeah, he's not here
[13:51:22] <kinblas_> toddparker: none of us have access
[13:51:32] <kinblas_> doesn't jeresig have?
[13:51:52] <kinblas> hmmm pwer is off in the buildings but our network is still up
[13:51:53] <gnarf> i told danheberden to peek at this convo - he might have the access you require
[13:51:55] <kinblas> amazing
[13:52:10] <gnarf> you guys know what needs to happen?
[13:52:10] <danheberden> so whats up?
[13:52:34] <toddparker> this url: http://jquerymobile.com/test/
[13:52:41] <toddparker> is synced to the latest in git
[13:52:54] <danheberden> yeah, that's the thing eddie built right
[13:52:55] <danheberden> ?
[13:52:58] <toddparker> it's not syncing now
[13:53:02] <toddparker> yeah
[13:53:09] <toddparker> eddie's not around
[13:54:49] <kinblas> toddparker: just to answer your question, yes I see the updated platforms page in my last pull
[13:56:16] <danheberden> how 'bout now
[13:56:20] <danheberden> toddparker: ^
[13:58:00] <danheberden> toddddddddd
[13:58:04] <toddparker> hmmm, don't see it danheberden
[13:58:24] <toddparker> test this page:
[13:58:25] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/platforms.html
[13:58:34] <danheberden> ooh cdn shit
[13:58:36] <toddparker> does it say Beta 3 or 1.0rc1?
[13:58:42] <toddparker> #!@#$@ CDN
[13:59:05] <gseguin> toddparker: Beta 3
[13:59:16] <toddparker> gseguin: bah!
[13:59:25] <scottjehl> was that a hashbang?
[13:59:29] <gseguin> lol
[13:59:30] <toddparker> hey kinblas did you try pulling hat scroll suppression stuff out?
[13:59:42] <kinblas> toddparker: no
[13:59:49] <kinblas> toddparker: if we pull it out totally
[13:59:51] <scottjehl> there will be no hashbanging in this channel
[13:59:52] <danheberden> weird, it's not there but it's pulling?
[13:59:53] <kinblas> then the page will scroll
[14:00:02] <toddparker> scottjehl: nah, it was more like a Yosemite Sam-ism
[14:00:14] <kinblas> when someone swipes left/right
[14:00:17] <toddparker> LET THE PAGES SCROLL
[14:00:20] <kinblas> who wrote that code?
[14:00:30] <scottjehl> Sam would not have stood for #!that
[14:00:33] <toddparker> duno
[14:01:07] <kinblas> toddparker: I don't know what the intent was, but I assume it was that if you use swipe left/right that you were going to initiate some scrolling on your own
[14:01:28] <kinblas> toddparker: it's easy to remove that code, but just want to make sure that's really what you guys want?
[14:01:44] <toddparker> i'm just wondering if we should remove it and test on some devices
[14:01:56] <toddparker> maybe it's not needed
[14:01:57] <kinblas> toddparker: note that it scrolls on Android because you have to preventDefault() on touchstart
[14:02:02] <kinblas> on iOS it doesn't scroll
[14:02:16] <kinblas> because preventDefault() on touchmove kills native scroll
[14:02:32] <toddparker> so this just just for handling horizontal swipes?
[14:02:33] <kinblas> toddparker: remove for rc2 right?
[14:02:42] <toddparker> RC1 has shipped
[14:02:42] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah horizontal swipes
[14:02:49] <toddparker> yeah RC2, if at all
[14:03:08] <toddparker> if this adds and chunkiness at all
[14:03:20] <toddparker> and it's only for Android on horiz swipes, it needs to die
[14:03:26] <kinblas> heh well it's not supposed to scroll at all according to the code
[14:03:43] <kinblas> I'm just saying the fact that it scrolls on android is because of their lameness in choosing touchstart as the scroll killer
[14:04:25] <kinblas> tbenzige!
[14:04:41] <toddparker> hey tbenzige
[14:04:55] <tbenzige> hey there
[14:05:34] <kinblas> toddparker: so just to be clear ... that code is not there for Android only
[14:05:41] <kinblas> it's supposed to kill scrolling for all platforms
[14:06:27] <danheberden> toddparker are you sure that should not say beta 3
[14:06:29] <danheberden> it's pulling in now
[14:06:34] <danheberden> updating everytthing
[14:06:41] <kinblas> danheberden: in git it was updated 1.0 RC1
[14:06:50] <kinblas> I verified that in a pull locally
[14:06:51] <danheberden> kinblas isn't this what you want? http://jquerymobile.com/githook/
[14:06:53] <danheberden> + toddparker
[14:06:59] <gnarf> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/features.html
[14:07:11] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/githook/docs/about/platforms.html
[14:07:17] <toddparker> looks ok on gihook
[14:07:20] <toddparker> githook
[14:07:25] <gseguin> ouch! merge conflict
[14:07:34] <danheberden> yeah, test is who knows what
[14:07:36] <danheberden> i think?
[14:07:37] <toddparker> but not /test/
[14:07:38] <danheberden> i donno
[14:08:16] <toddparker> never seen githook. what's the difference with that and /test/
[14:08:36] <danheberden> it looks like the same thing
[14:08:39] <danheberden> jqm on master
[14:09:21] <danheberden> ok two different jobs
[14:09:23] <danheberden> lemme take a peak
[14:09:32] <scottjehl> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/features.html has a merge conflict showing in the browser rendering
[14:09:47] <toddparker> man, see this crap on the features page on test? http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/features.html
[14:09:52] <toddparker> yeah that
[14:10:42] <gseguin> it doesn't show on /githook/
[14:10:53] <danheberden> this shit is really really wonky
[14:11:28] <toddparker> yea!
[14:11:39] <toddparker> i hoping our system was wonky
[14:11:55] <toddparker> did the gerbil that copied and pasted code over to test die of starvation?
[14:12:02] <kinblas> lol
[14:12:04] <toddparker> DID A CAT GET INTO OUR SERVER?
[14:12:42] <gseguin> lol
[14:13:02] <gnarf> who knows it that will actually stay up to date with the new pushes tho
[14:13:16] <gnarf> after looking over danheberden's shoulder i'm wondering how that ever works :)
[14:13:39] <danheberden> ok test, um, did _something_
[14:13:47] <scottjehl> http://scottjehl.com/i/busy.gif
[14:14:09] <danheberden> boom done: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/platforms.html
[14:14:29] <scottjehl> thanks!
[14:14:41] <gseguin> thank you danheberden!
[14:14:49] <danheberden> of course
[14:14:51] <kinblas> danheberden: so what did you do?
[14:14:53] <kinblas> to fix it
[14:15:04] <danheberden> ran the update bash files that php is supposed to call
[14:15:06] <danheberden> it's all broken
[14:15:09] <gseguin> ln -s githook test ?
[14:15:11] <danheberden> and tehre was some pull issue
[14:15:15] <gseguin> :)
[14:15:21] <danheberden> since git isn't forcing a checkout on origin/master
[14:15:31] <danheberden> which happens if you ever revert/ammend a commit and push
[14:15:36] <danheberden> the server pull gets all funky
[14:18:56] <scottjehl> maybe it just needs to change to a hard reset to origin/master or something
[14:20:13] <gnarf> thats basically what we did by hand
[14:21:12] <scottjehl> well hey congrats, team. an RC is big
[14:24:19] <kinblas> scottjehl: werd
[14:24:48] <scottjehl> kinblas - no last-minute flights to Boston available ?
[14:24:49] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: so why would TR zip up a gzipped css/js file?
[14:25:04] <kinblas> scottjehl: unfortunately not
[14:25:11] <scottjehl> nah not gzip - just minify
[14:25:15] <toddparker> thanks danheberden!!
[14:25:17] <toddparker> you rokk
[14:25:23] <danheberden> i will take all credit for rc1 because of this, i hope you know
[14:25:28] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah that's what I thought too ... the server is supposed to do that dynamically.
[14:25:37] <scottjehl> ya
[14:25:39] <toddparker> it's yours :)
[14:25:43] <toddparker> all the bugs, right?
[14:25:45] <kinblas> danheberden: great! you can have credit for fast-click too!
[14:25:54] <danheberden> hells yes
[14:25:54] <toddparker> take it
[14:25:56] <danheberden> MINE
[14:26:02] <danheberden> NOMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[14:26:35] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: so tbenzige doesn't have to include the gzip'd files as indicated in Todd's email?
[14:26:43] <kinblas> I was a bit confused by that request.
[14:26:57] <toddparker> oh, sorry about that
[14:27:01] <toddparker> i'm an idiot
[14:27:40] <kinblas> toddparker: nah, I was just wondering if I was missing something.
[14:27:54] <kinblas> tbenzige: so nix the gz request
[14:28:17] <kinblas> hey guys, the power is out so security is telling us to go home because it won't come back for another 2+ hours
[14:28:27] <scottjehl> go home, Kin!
[14:28:42] <kinblas> I'm still amazed the wifi is working here
[14:29:06] <kinblas> anyways, any last minute things you need me for? Otherwise I'll be back on in about 30+ minutes or so
[14:30:52] <scottjehl> kinblas, all set here.
[14:31:12] <kinblas> alrighty then
[14:31:17] <kinblas> see you guys in a bit
[14:44:52] <toddparker> thanks ki
[14:48:01] <gnarf> toddparker: updated topic on #jquery
[15:00:18] <kinblas> damn already an RC1 bug
[15:03:29] <scottjehl> hmm.
[15:03:48] <scottjehl> odd. that wasn't there recently
[15:04:40] <scottjehl> pushstate change maybe
[15:04:43] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah, I'm looking at it .. that URL is the result of a pushstate rewrite
[15:04:58] <scottjehl> yeah, but I'm sure those worked at some point
[15:05:32] <scottjehl> yep http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b3/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html#&ui-state=dialog
[15:05:36] <scottjehl> fine in B3
[15:12:16] <kinblas> damn it's my fault
[15:12:18] <kinblas> grrr
[15:12:35] <kinblas> it was my fix for looking up un-enhanced pages by id as a fallback
[15:12:53] <kinblas> in that case the URL is just the dialog gobbledy gook
[15:12:59] <kinblas> which gets stripped down to an empty string
[15:13:16] <kinblas> so we end up looking for a $(pagecontainer).children("#")
[15:13:42] <toddparker> c'mon kinblas, get yer head in the game sonny
[15:13:51] <toddparker> you're benched of rate next game
[15:13:55] <kinblas> damn
[15:13:58] <kinblas> coach
[15:13:59] <toddparker> for the next game
[15:14:10] <toddparker> dDROP AND GIVE ME 20
[15:43:43] <kinblas> scottjehl: you still around?
[15:43:54] <scottjehl> here
[15:44:00] <scottjehl> saw you dropped that fix in
[15:44:02] <scottjehl> nice
[15:44:45] <kinblas> do the support tests prohibit jquerymobile.js from being included at the bottom of the file?
[15:44:56] <kinblas> wondering because of the fakebody monkey business
