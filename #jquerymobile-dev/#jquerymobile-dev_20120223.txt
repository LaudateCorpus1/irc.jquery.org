[01:12:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/t9WZnA
[01:12:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] added a failing unit test for issue #3276 - support for data-role="dialog" - scottjehl
[01:12:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added support for data-role="dialog". When a dialog is the first "page"-type element in the DOM, jQM will enhance it, triggering dialog enhancements as usual for non-ajax environments. Updated the /docs/pages/dialog.html page's role to date-role="dialog" to demonstrate the change.  Fixes #3276. - scottjehl
[08:51:15] <gseguin> good morning
[09:01:33] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I don't know if you saw it but the ajax=false containers is done and I added docs
[09:01:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: w00t scott made the dialog change
[09:02:08] <gseguin> johnbender: I think toddmparker_ is away today
[09:02:12] <johnbender> gseguin: orly
[09:07:56] <Wilto> Same here.
[09:08:17] <Wilto> Stuck in meetings on the left coast all day.
[09:08:44] <Wilto> gseguin: Saw you got that controlgroup dealie sorted; good stuff, man.
[09:09:23] <gseguin> Wilto: controlgroup? you mean collapsible set
[09:09:38] <gseguin> yeah I added a refresh method
[09:09:49] <gseguin> should probably do the same for collapsible
[09:09:51] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, sorry. Blame it on jet lag.
[09:11:26] <gseguin> did you notice, the ocean is on the right side here ;)
[09:12:06] <Wilto> Weeeird.
[09:12:46] <Wilto> I don’t think I’d ever get anything done here. I’d wake up every day thinking “whatever; the east coast is already workin’ on this stuff. They got this.”
[09:13:43] <gseguin> what do you think I do?
[09:13:50] <gseguin> :P
[09:16:20] <gseguin> johnbender: could you review my change I made yesterday?
[09:17:07] <gseguin> johnbender: especially the line I have doubt about is: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/60f20e06e2ec6d64dec77947bfe50c2c8fb2690d/js/jquery.mobile.collapsibleSet.js#L60
[09:17:35] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: you there?

[09:51:25] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #496: ABORTED in 2 min 53 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/496/

[10:44:13] <johnbender> gseguin: looking at your commit
[10:46:08] <johnbender> gseguin: you can also use $.fn.jqmEnhanceable if you want, though using enhanceWithin/enhance means that all future enhancement changes will "just work"
[10:46:41] <johnbender> that one is ignoreContentEnabled specific
[10:46:48] <johnbender> though you'd never know that by the name right now :D
[10:47:39] <gseguin> so it looks ok to you? I was wondering if it was really the job of refresh to enhance the children of that node
[10:47:51] <johnbender> gseguin: yah that looks odd to me too tbh
[10:48:05] <johnbender> seems like that should be handled on create no?
[10:48:25] <gseguin> so on create that actually doesn't do much
[10:48:52] <gseguin> because at that point the existing collapsible in the set would already be enhanced
[10:49:07] <gseguin> but if you have dynamic content in your collapsible-set
[10:49:20] <gseguin> then...
[10:49:33] <gseguin> brb
[10:55:35] <johnbender> gseguin: I guess I'm not clear on why the pagecreate/create binding in the collapsible plugin itself doesn't get called
[10:57:33] <Wilto> You guys doin’ the meeting thing today?
[10:59:20] <johnbender> Wilto: there's a good question
[10:59:22] <johnbender> actually
[10:59:30] <johnbender> I have at least one thing I'd like to run by everyone
[11:03:17] <Wilto> johnbender has the conch.
[11:03:17] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: _|Nix|_ I think we should do the meeting
[11:03:25] <Wilto> I’ll have someone turn on #jquery-meeting
[11:03:27] <_|Nix|_> _|Nix|_: Works for me.
[11:03:27] <bot-t> (24 hours 10 mins ago) <gseguin> tell _|Nix|_: I've got a few questions regarding the popup widget, ping me when you're on
[11:03:33] <_|Nix|_> O_o
[11:03:36] <Wilto> Oh, nevermind.
[11:04:09] <Wilto> Somebody mind keeping notes in there, so Todd and I can catch up later?
[11:04:21] <gseguin> https://plus.google.com/hangouts/203160142c6c8602587a3dc4e73203d5f29e4aed
[11:07:29] <_|Nix|_> Crap .
[11:07:37] <_|Nix|_> It keeps dying on me ...
[11:10:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #500: SUCCESS in 29 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/500/
[11:10:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: pewp
[11:10:58] <johnbender> we'll wait for you
[11:18:09] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: sorry man
[11:18:16] <_|Nix|_> Alright ... so, let's talk about the popup.
[11:18:40] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: for some reason your voice is robotized
[11:18:41] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: NP ... dunno what the problem is ... maybe I need to update my chrome, or maybe I should be using FF, or ... I dunno ...
[11:18:55] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I've been getting disconnected, like, every 5 minutes.
[11:18:57] <gseguin> or upgrade your DSL
[11:19:05] <gseguin> :)
[11:19:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I get, like, 100KB/s up and 1MB/s down ... I think that's pretty decent ...
[11:20:07] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: But anyway ...
[11:20:34] <gseguin> alright so popup
[11:20:50] <gseguin> why do you change the location?
[11:21:07] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You mean that whole hashchange stuff? I didn't add that ...
[11:21:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It didn't originally.
[11:21:51] * gseguin pulls up the file
[11:21:56] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It should, however, listen for hashchange so it closes the popup when the user clicks back or something ...
[11:23:24] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/popup-widget/js/jquery.mobile.popup.js#L228
[11:23:48] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/popup-widget/js/jquery.mobile.popup.js#L265
[11:24:01] <gseguin> these are the 2 lines I was wondering about
[11:24:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, I know about that. I didn't add those lines.
[11:24:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: They were not part of my original PR.
[11:24:56] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: a little bit of background, I was trying to backport that plugin into our codebase here and was having trouble mainly because of these lines
[11:25:07] <Wilto> ’Twas not I.
[11:25:29] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Right ...
[11:25:36] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Dunno how to use git blame ...
[11:25:41] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I should learn.
[11:26:16] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blame/popup-widget/js/jquery.mobile.popup.js
[11:26:39] <Wilto> ’Twas I after all!
[11:26:43] <Wilto> But merging in something from Scott.
[11:28:17] <_|Nix|_> Modifying the history makes it really complicated to show one popup from another.
[11:28:17] <gseguin> DAMMIT WILTO!
[11:28:43] <gseguin> yeah it was actually breaking really bad in my case
[11:29:26] <gseguin> I want to make sure that I make changes that I can push back
[11:29:34] <_|Nix|_> Check this out: docs/pages/popup/index.html ... click on "Tooltip" then click the link in the tooltip.
[11:30:07] <_|Nix|_> ... then, try to get back to the page.
[11:30:32] <gseguin> yeah that's exactly what I was facing
[11:30:42] <gseguin> Wilto: any idea why that's there?
[11:31:18] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'm all in favour of getting rid of the history modification, but I would like to keep the hashchange listener so that we close the popup when the user navigates away from the page.
[11:31:59] <_|Nix|_> Otherwise, when she goes back to the page, the popup window css animation happens again and it looks like she clicked on the last whatever that caused the popup to appear in the first place.
[11:32:24] <gseguin> yep
[11:32:45] <gseguin> though it looks like that change was intentional
[11:32:51] * gseguin pulls up the commit
[11:32:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Alternatively, we could correctly manipulate the history, and maybe go like, &popup-level-1=true&popup-level-2=true&...
[11:33:19] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/4b74d9d73825c49b3ada34f66faf9db43d90644c
[11:33:19] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by scottjehl (2m, 2w ago): Added functional preliminary support for browser back button, so that popups can be dismissed by clicking back (particularly important on mobile devices like BlackBerry).
[11:33:54] <gseguin> that makes sense
[11:34:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, but if you open a popup from a popup, the history needs to be changed again ...
[11:34:38] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I guess that commit assumes there will only ever be one popup above the page.
[11:34:46] <gseguin> yeah because it's the only way the back button would discard it
[11:35:44] <gseguin> alright, I have to run, I'm glad I know what was the intended behavior
[11:36:07] <gseguin> I will try to investigate why it wasn't working for me
[11:36:08] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I can try to make multiple stacked popups work.
[11:36:19] <gseguin> that would be fantastic!
[11:36:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It would be great for dropdown menus.
[11:37:10] <gseguin> you want to pull from that branch before you start working as I've done a  coding standar pass on it
[11:37:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Alright, I might devote it some attention after the baby's gone to sleep (~1.5 hrs).
[11:37:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK.
[11:37:22] <gseguin> s/standar/standards/
[11:37:38] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, sorry ... I really have to switch back to using tabs.
[11:37:56] <gseguin> no worries
[11:38:28] <gseguin> what was really bothering me were the implicit blocks
[11:38:47] <gseguin> these are too harmful to leave them in
[11:38:49] <_|Nix|_> implicit blocks?
[11:38:59] <gseguin> if ( condition ) action
[11:39:03] <gseguin> without curlies
[11:39:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Oh ... I guess ...
[11:39:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'm used to that from C.
[11:39:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll try to avoid them.
[11:39:47] <gseguin> yeah but same in C, though shall always use curlies
[11:40:05] <gseguin> s/though/thou/
[11:40:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: *shrug* ... I guess ...
[11:41:04] <gseguin> anyway... gotta run now
[11:41:12] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: K L8R
[11:41:13] <gseguin> thanks a lot _|Nix|_
[11:41:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: NP.
[11:41:20] <gseguin> later
[12:11:52] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #501: SUCCESS in 31 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/501/
[12:24:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we'll need popup stacks to work if we're going to replace dialogs with them
[12:24:44] <johnbender> if you're interested in the current logic for handling history traversal in that situation let mek now
[12:24:52] <johnbender> I did the hacking for it
[12:38:00] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: does the node semver lib work with the 2.0 release candidate syntax? eg 1.1.0-rc.1 < 1.1.0-rc.2
[12:38:21] <johnbender> just want to make sure our tags will work with the plugin site
[12:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:38:51] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: yar!
[12:38:54] <johnbender> great
[12:38:55] <johnbender> thanks
[12:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: You have node installed locally, right?
[12:39:28] <johnbender> I do but it's not stdlib eh?
[12:39:31] <johnbender> it's also way out of date
[12:39:42] <scott_gonzalez> Out of date is probably fine.
[12:39:55] <scott_gonzalez> If you npm install semver, you can do really quick tests in the REPL.
[12:40:01] <scott_gonzalez> node
[12:40:13] <johnbender> indeed, just figured I ask
[12:40:15] <johnbender> :D
[12:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> require( "semver" ).valid( "1.1.0-rc.1" )
[12:40:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, no problem. Just wanted to let you know the quickest way to do a for-sure test.
[12:40:45] <johnbender> once I get node sequestered inside a vm I'll be a bit happier with installing deps on my machine
[12:40:57] * johnbender is ocd
[12:41:13] * johnbender *has filesystem cleanliness ocd
[12:41:38] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:42:09] <scott_gonzalez> You don't want to see my filesystem :-P
[12:42:35] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I've got a small ssd too so that makes it worse
[12:43:49] <scott_gonzalez> Did anyone talk to you guys about using grunt for builds?
[12:44:20] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: nope, do tell
[12:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ben Alman created a new build tool called grunt
[12:45:39] <johnbender> I've seen him tweeting about it
[12:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> We're looking to move all jQuery projects over to it (moving away from make/ant)
[12:45:52] <scott_gonzalez> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ne5YxQNJu_jpPLB3z8ockT7Hw569Np4wwkbSIN8Fw5A/edit
[12:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's written in node, so it should be pretty easy to convert your existing stuff.
[12:47:00] <scott_gonzalez> You can create custom tasks for whatever you need, so you should be able to just hook in existing code.
[12:47:31] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: any examples - the vast majority of Makefile is bash
[12:47:46] <johnbender> just wondering what that looks like in a grunt build file
[12:47:55] <scott_gonzalez> There are a bunch of examples in the grutn repo.
[12:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> *grunt
[12:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/example_gruntfiles.md
[12:49:17] <scott_gonzalez> Ben actually has decent documentation around it: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/toc.md
[12:49:20] <Wilto> No idea, gseguin.
[12:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> I just started playing with it last night and was able to get it working on a small project in no time.
[12:49:54] <Wilto> gseguin: Maybe for the sake of using the back button to close popups?
[12:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> If you have any questions, rwaldron, rworth, and I can help.
[12:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> Also, Ben has #grunt
[12:50:58] <Wilto> grunt++
[12:51:08] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer can also answer questions
[12:51:08] <Wilto> Looks dope, from what I’ve read.
[12:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> That Google Doc lists who's leading the conversion for each project, so you can see who will have experience with it.
[12:53:16] * rwaldron nods
[12:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Have you started on core?
[12:54:08] <rwaldron> no, I need to finish this client work that ends tomorro
[12:54:11] <rwaldron> tomorrow*
[12:54:21] <rwaldron> I plan to begin this weekend/next week
[12:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, just wanted to make sure I had the correct status in the doc.
[12:58:58] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: you can put my name in there
[12:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> Cool. You have edit access to that doc too :-)
[12:59:14] <johnbender> though I have to take a look before agreeing to switch, I suppose that's still on the table for discussion
[12:59:21] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: thanks!
[12:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> It's set to any with the URL has edit access.
[12:59:40] <johnbender> I'm going to go look at examples after I finish a quick email
[13:00:39] <JasonDScott> Is anyone else having trouble viewing the docs in master? Chrome is not liking this --->   <script src="js/"></script>
[13:01:50] <johnbender> JasonDScott: hmm I run chrome and I'm not having issues :(
[13:02:03] <johnbender> JasonDScott: are you running direct from the file system?
[13:02:18] <johnbender> JasonDScott: we switched back to requiring php at the Todd and Scott's request
[13:02:59] <JasonDScott> ahh i was using a node server :|
[13:03:55] <JasonDScott> johnbender: Thanks
[13:04:46] <johnbender> JasonDScott: It's on my list of things to do to switch the php over to node so we can do support both
[13:04:49] <johnbender> sigh
[13:04:54] <johnbender> so many things on my todo list
[13:05:00] <johnbender> JasonDScott: sorry :( :(
[13:05:08] <johnbender> I didn't want to switch it but loading async was causing people issues
[13:05:15] * gseguin catches up
[13:07:23] <JasonDScott> johnbender: no worries. Were files being loaded out of order?
[13:08:34] <johnbender> JasonDScott: in some cases yes, which was the point of loading them async so we could find implicit load order deps, but it was causing some frustration :(
[13:11:04] <gseguin> Wilto: yep that's exactly that. I realized after I asked that your commit was pointing at the original one where Scott's comment is obvious
[13:11:20] <johnbender> sadly if they show up once we get our builder set up,  that is externally with our users, it's going to be much much harder to sort out :(
[13:11:33] <johnbender> we'll have to ask for the exact build file they have to do any kind of debugging
[13:11:37] * johnbender shrugs
[13:11:56] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #502: SUCCESS in 31 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/502/
[13:12:12] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: it looks like I can add a task that just shell execs some bash, in which case I could just move our build targets out to a set of scripts in a bin dir
[13:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but you should probably try to integrate as much as you can.
[13:13:02] <scott_gonzalez> It'll go a long way toward cross-platform build support.
[13:13:30] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: meaning using the builtins where possible?
[13:13:58] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: we can probably do the require stuff in process too
[13:14:28] <johnbender> ah, you mean for windows users
[13:14:30] <johnbender> agreed
[13:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[13:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> See https://forum.jquery.com/topic/build-system-future#14737000003081041 for a recent complaint.
[13:15:14] * johnbender does not relish doing complex find/manipulations with node
[13:15:23] <johnbender> it's a fair point
[13:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> We'll also try to find common tasks between the various projects and pull them into a repo.
[13:17:17] <scott_gonzalez> So we can all leverage common helpers without duplicating effort.
[13:17:23] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I can't promise that we'll devote a whole ton of time to it though that's up to Todd
[13:17:36] <johnbender> especially given that we haven't had any complaints yet
[13:17:44] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: that would be great
[13:34:17] <johnbender> gseguin: is the builder going to cache builds over time?
[13:34:41] <johnbender> gseguin: I was thinking about what I just said to JasonDScott and I'm wondering how we're going to diagnose possible load order issues :(
[13:35:20] <johnbender> obviously we can tell them to try loading the whole monolithic library but if we confirm that there is in fact an issue we'll need to get our hands on the file
[13:35:40] <johnbender> I'm going on the assumption that the ordering between builds is not determined
[13:35:54] <johnbender> s/determined/deterministic/
[13:36:18] <JasonDScott> we used this to fix some load order problems https://github.com/tinyhippos/jWorkflow
[13:36:53] <johnbender> JasonDScott: well there's an order plugin for require js
[13:36:58] <johnbender> so we can enforce ordering
[13:36:58] <gseguin> johnbender: my builder does cache yes
[13:37:04] <johnbender> gseguin: cool, for how long
[13:37:12] <johnbender> gseguin: and how many combos
[13:37:18] <johnbender> now I'm just curious
[13:37:32] <johnbender> and is there a way to associate the build you get with the cached version so we could pull it down?
[13:37:43] <gseguin> until the next commit on that branch
[13:38:04] <johnbender> ah
[13:38:05] <johnbender> nice
[13:39:11] <johnbender> gseguin: given that we've been pretty stable with the stable branches (zing!) maybe that's reason for hope
[13:40:17] <gseguin> but you can also checkout a tag and then it will cache the combos forever
[13:41:00] <johnbender> gseguin: or until you switch the tag
[13:41:05] <johnbender> ?
[13:41:39] <gseguin> hmm... not handled yet
[13:42:03] <gseguin> I'll create an issue
[13:44:08] <gseguin> https://github.com/gseguin/node-amd-builder/issues/1
[13:44:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1 on node-amd-builder, reported by gseguin (20.747s ago): Detect ref change
[13:44:51] <johnbender> gseguin: oh no need to change it, I'm not clear which way you would want it
[13:45:15] <johnbender> I mean for debugging it would be amazing to take a hash in the file and be able to get the same source from the builder
[13:45:24] <johnbender> so that would mean keeping the cache across ref changes
[13:45:28] <johnbender> sorry
[13:46:27] <gseguin> hmm... that's going to be a lot harder to do
[13:50:18] <johnbender> gseguin: k, I was only speculating
[13:50:26] <johnbender> I'm having nightmares about debugging load order issues
[13:52:23] <gseguin> so we could mark the bundle with the sha1 and append the config in a comment
[13:53:07] <johnbender> gseguin: how do we repro a file that results in the same sha?
[13:53:45] <gseguin> the sha1 would be the one of HEAD in the current checked out repo
[13:53:59] <johnbender> gseguin: ah I'm  thinking about custom builds
[13:54:08] <johnbender> gseguin: unless it's just the same
[13:54:10] <gseguin> and the config would tell you which files where asked to be included
[13:54:20] <johnbender> ahh
[13:54:35] <johnbender> cool
[13:54:40] <johnbender> that's good news
[13:54:41] <gseguin> the combination of both should be enough
[13:54:44] <johnbender> yep
[13:54:56] <johnbender> just need the sha then we can go back and grab the config
[13:55:15] <gseguin> that's what I'm thinking
[13:55:20] <johnbender> alright
[13:55:30] <johnbender> I wouldn't waste any time on it just yet
[13:55:32] <gseguin> time to create issue #2
[13:55:33] <johnbender> just thinking
[14:11:53] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #503: SUCCESS in 31 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/503/
[15:01:29] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: do any of the jquery projects take survey's of their users?
[15:01:52] <johnbender> it might be nice to know how many people would like to do custom builds on windows, and how many do custom builds at all
[15:03:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/FqSclQ

[15:10:17] <Wilto> What have we here.
[15:10:17] <bot-t> (1 hour 16 mins ago) <nlogax> tell Wilto http://i.imgur.com/uPC2b.gif for your collection

[16:20:41] <johnbender> gseguin: you may get your wish where the build is concerned
[16:21:47] <johnbender> if we move over to using grunt I'm guessing we can just use require from within node
[16:21:53] <johnbender> we can also do linting as part of the build then too
[17:11:51] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #507: SUCCESS in 31 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/507/
[17:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: We haven't really done that. We'd get an extremely small result set.
[17:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: It also doesn't really matter. We're too big to be irresponsible about stuff like this.
