[06:59:53] <toddmparker_> good news - our nexus S should get ice cream sandwich soon - http://blogs.computerworld.com/19440/android_ice_cream_sandwich_nexus_s?source=rss_blogs
[07:00:01] <toddmparker_> can't wait to test it
[07:00:16] <toddmparker_> in fact, i saw the ICS update on the phone, but it's disappeared
[07:04:38] <toddmparker_> I'm thinking we should try and get a real slider change event in for 1.1 - seems to cause a lot fo questions/problems

[07:04:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1589 on jquery-mobile, reported by tenor (7m, 1w ago): Feature Request: Slider Change Event
[07:20:18] <Wilto> Whassup, all.
[07:41:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to css-fixed: http://git.io/0Olv-w
[07:41:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/css-fixed] Changed the z-index of the slider handle from 10 and 20 to 1 for both types to prevent it from running over the fixed toolbars - toddparker
[07:47:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Did you get my earlier messages? Our demo is at web-ui-fw.github.com ...
[07:47:54] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: hey! no, I didn't..w.as it up above?
[07:48:02] <toddmparker_> thanks
[07:48:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Yeah, I mentioned it about, oh, 16 hours ago, so it might be past the edge of your scrollback buffer ... NP.
[07:49:34] <toddmparker_> thanks for the the reminder
[07:49:40] <toddmparker_> you guys have build some really cool stuff
[07:49:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I did make a few changes to popup (mostly lessons learned since my initial pull request), so I made another pull request agains dialog-refactor ...
[07:49:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Thanks!
[07:50:18] <toddmparker_> so is that a pull against the dialog-refactor branch?
[07:50:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: It is.
[07:51:00] <toddmparker_> perfect
[07:51:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I added the z-index stuff, and got rid of the matching-data-options-to-this.options stuff, because it's now done in the superclass.
[07:51:09] <toddmparker_> matt will pull that in, then make a proper branch
[07:54:39] <toddmparker_> since we're talking about pulling in the auto-gen list headers
[07:54:56] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: how heavy is that quick scroll (letter picker) feature?
[07:55:05] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Some baller stuff in those demos.
[07:55:50] <toddmparker_> also wondering if you guys have done any work in lists on re-ordering or a swipe to delete/show row menu
[07:56:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: We have swipe-to-reveal-buttons-undeerneath-a-list-itme, but no swipe-to-delete ...
[07:56:29] <toddmparker_> is that in the demos?
[07:56:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Checking on the deps for shortcutscroll ...
[07:56:37] <toddmparker_> ok
[07:56:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Yeah: "Swipe list"
[07:58:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: shortcutscroll has a CSS file - that's it.
[07:58:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Based on $.mobile.widget ...
[07:59:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ... so it fits the pattern, I guess ...
[07:59:25] <toddmparker_> no js at all?
[07:59:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Nono ... sorry ... I mean it has a js and a css, but it doesn't depend on other js files.
[07:59:50] <toddmparker_> guessing you'd only see letters for letters/dividers that exist
[07:59:54] <toddmparker_> oh, cool
[08:00:01] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Exactly.
[08:00:21] <toddmparker_> if that is light, we may give that a look too
[08:00:51] <toddmparker_> was saying that for a later release (not 1.1), it would be cool to design and build a full set of list interactions as part of the core library
[08:01:18] <toddmparker_> so _|Nix|_ are you just working on jQM most of your time for tizen?
[08:01:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Check out http://web-ui-fw.github.com/deps.manual.svg - it's slightly out pf date, but you can click on any file to see its deps.
[08:02:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: We're making a widget set ... I guess it's part of tizen in some way, shape or form ...
[08:02:16] <toddmparker_> gotcha
[08:02:28] <toddmparker_> but you're focused on this most of your time?
[08:02:34] <toddmparker_> be great to collab with you
[08:02:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I am until they tell me otherwise :)
[08:02:45] <toddmparker_> meant intel, sorry
[08:02:47] <toddmparker_> cool
[08:03:04] <toddmparker_> think we can definitely help each other along. you guys have done a ton
[08:03:13] <toddmparker_> i'd like to get people using your stuff
[08:03:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I hope so.
[08:03:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Me too :)
[08:03:28] <toddmparker_> hold on, i have a call, sorry
[08:04:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I've made an app that's part of the web-ui-fw distro called option-tester. It loads a widget and creates inputs for all the widget's options, and allows you to set any of the options to see if the widget reacts properly to a value change.
[08:04:56] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[08:05:02] <toddmparker_> very cool
[08:05:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I'ts pretty rudimentary, but it was a great shakedown for the whole project.
[08:05:19] <toddmparker_> all your widgets use the widget factory, right?
[08:05:35] <toddmparker_> think we could use that too or is it tied in with your code?
[08:05:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: The fundamental limitation is that the element the widget is supposed to be based on can be just about anything ... so, it's probably better to roll the option-input-list into a widget and let the user click on the widget they wanna poke.
[08:06:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: All our widgets use the widget factory.
[08:06:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I'm trying to decide whether to rip it out of our repo and make it into its own app, or not.
[08:07:00] <toddmparker_> well, if it could be usable to demo our widgets too, we'd use it
[08:07:05] <toddmparker_> if that makes a diff
[08:07:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ... though some of the widgets use a common base class called widgetex which provides some basics ...
[08:07:39] <toddmparker_> are those candidates for core?
[08:07:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: In theory, yes. In fact, I've instantiated a slider before. The problem is that there's currently no way to specify min=5 max=50 etc.
[08:08:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I believe so.
[08:08:26] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I especially recommend $.todons.widgetex.assignElements
[08:09:45] <toddmparker_> it would be great to hear where we could add improvements since you've built so much with this
[08:09:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Takes a jQuery object containing a large chunk of HTML and assigns jQuery objects like this -> { blah: "#blah"; something: "#something"; } -> { blah: $("#blah"); something: $("#something"); } etc.
[08:10:11] <toddmparker_> kinblas, johnbender and gseguin especially need to hear some of this when they get on
[08:10:14] <toddmparker_> (west coast)
[08:11:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I'm mostly a stickler for consistency ... so, things like updating data-option-name and this.optionName whenever someone calls ("option", "optionName", newValue) ...
[08:11:20] <_|Nix|_> This could be made systematic.
[08:11:29] <toddmparker_> sure, sure
[08:12:40] <_|Nix|_> Though some stuff is already making it into $.mobile.widget (IIRC), like enabled: function() {this._setOption("disabled", false); } ... and stuff like that.
[08:13:31] <_|Nix|_> But yeah ... moving stuff into base classes is tricky and should be done with the utmost scrutiny ...
[08:15:38] <toddmparker_> sure
[08:16:00] <toddmparker_> i think  you and the other guys will have a good conversation
[08:17:34] <_|Nix|_> I'm sure we will learn a lot :)
[08:18:15] <_|Nix|_> Problem is, we're in Eastern Europe ... maybe I should talk to my manager about setting up something on the West Coast next march ... we'll be there for a few days then ...
[08:18:30] <_|Nix|_> Well, Eastern Europe and London, England ....

[08:25:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: readiing
[08:26:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Huh?
[08:28:11] <toddmparker_> johnbender is just getting caught up
[08:29:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I just wanted to read through your conversation with toddmparker_
[08:29:46] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I just responded to sergey about the bottom corner thing
[08:29:53] <toddmparker_> thanks
[08:29:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's something of an api decision
[08:30:11] <johnbender> that is, "where does the data attribute go"
[08:30:24] <johnbender> and I wanted to know if we could turn that off by default?
[08:30:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[08:30:41] <johnbender> OH!
[08:31:10] <johnbender> and I asked if he would put together a perf test page for the changes he made in the other pull request
[08:31:18] <toddmparker_> cool
[08:31:30] <johnbender> otherwise we won't know if we're negatively affecting other platforms
[08:31:41] <toddmparker_> seems like and add data attr
[08:31:46] <toddmparker_> odd
[08:33:33] <toddmparker_> on a call so a bit distracted
[08:33:35] <toddmparker_> sorry
[08:57:26] <toddmparker_> ok
[08:57:31] <toddmparker_> so johnbender - So the key issue is that the bottom corners of any sort of dialog is horribly slow only on WP7, right?
[08:58:32] <_nickel> toddmparker_: according to what I read from sergey yes
[08:58:42] * _nickel is on his mac in the living room and too lazy to move is thinkpad
[09:05:34] <_|Nix|_> Sorry to bring this up here, but I haven't been able to get an answer elsewhere: Once I call .buttonMarkup() on something, how do I later mark the element as disabled?
[09:06:30] <Wilto> You mean for an actual button element, or a faux-disabled link?
[09:06:33] <_|Nix|_> If I call .buttonMarkup again, it just adds itself again ... I tried .empty().attr("data-" + ($.mobile.ns || "") + "disabled").buttonMarkup() but that didn't work either?
[09:06:56] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: For something upon which I called .buttonMarkup().
[09:07:12] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: An empty div a $("a"), whatever ...
[09:07:27] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So, not an actual button.
[09:07:34] <Wilto> Ah, yeah—there is no method for “disabling” links.
[09:07:49] <_|Nix|_> :(
[09:07:57] <Wilto> Since there… is no method for disabling links, if that makes sense. You could add a class of “ui-disabled” and preventDefault/return false on it.
[09:08:25] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: OK ...
[09:08:28] <Wilto> It’s a weird grey area, where it _kind of_ makes sense in that it looks like a button.
[09:08:39] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Exactly ...
[09:09:01] <Wilto> But, it isn’t, and it would be weird to add that kind of functionality to an anchor tag.
[09:10:14] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: What if you have $("<div>").appendTo(theDOM).buttonMarkup()? That's not an anchor tag, and it looks like a button.
[09:10:16] <Wilto> It’s like, how often does one see pseudo-disabled links in the wild? I think the fact that it looks button-y is throwing people.
[09:10:51] <Wilto> Likewise, there’s no native “disabled” thing for divs, y’know? You never see a method of disabling divs out there on the web.
[09:11:10] <Wilto> But again, you could bolt .ui-disabled on there to make it appear disabled.
[09:11:45] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Yes, but a widget can be disabled. If you consider buttonMarkup to be a canned routine for drawing something that looks like a button, it should support "disabled", just like widgets do, in case you want to use it to draw part of your widget.
[09:11:58] <toddmparker_> yeah, we've been debating this quite a bit
[09:12:12] <Wilto> Yeah, but the form widgets are all based on inputs. Which can be disabled.
[09:12:18] <Wilto> So with JS off, they behave as expected.
[09:12:28] <Wilto> With JS off, a pseudo-disabled link will work.
[09:12:29] <toddmparker_> people assume you can disable a link button but by calling button's disable method, it gets wrapped again
[09:12:50] <Wilto> Adding that would be treading on native markup’s turf, and that’s not something I dig.
[09:18:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3157
[09:18:21] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by remidewitte (3w, 5d ago): Allow to define on li the data-iconpos="left".
[09:18:49] <johnbender> that's an easy one to pull in and test just want to make sure we want to support it
[09:21:46] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender
[09:21:48] <toddmparker_> looking
[09:22:11] <toddmparker_> think that's a great feature
[09:22:17] <toddmparker_> we need better TRL support
[09:22:34] <toddmparker_> jQM is used probably more internationally than anything
[09:22:36] <Wilto> I went straight to “Total Request Live” just then—I don’t know what that says about me.
[09:22:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the icon comes from links right?
[09:23:08] <toddmparker_> i believe so, but you can also set the icon on the list itself
[09:23:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: for the link the text is overlayed on top of it :(
[09:23:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: should I hand that off to your or Wilto?
[09:23:54] <johnbender> it's going on Master anyway
[09:23:56] <toddmparker_> so this doesn't add padding to move the text away from the link
[09:24:06] <Wilto> So, _|Nix|_: I’ve talked myself into and out of a global “disable” method like three times over here. For now, I’d just do the .ui-disabled/return false thing.
[09:24:07] <johnbender> toddmparker_: nope its just a js change
[09:24:19] <toddmparker_> bah humbug
[09:24:21] <toddmparker_> ok
[09:24:29] <toddmparker_> wilto can fix the css
[09:24:33] <Wilto> UGH FINE
[09:26:00] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #346: STILL FAILING in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/346/

[09:26:19] <johnbender> hrm
[09:26:38] <Wilto> The all-caps makes it so much scarier.
[09:29:59] <Wilto> Anyway, yeah, pull that sucker into master and I’ll add the associated CSS right quick.
[09:30:15] <Wilto> Oh, scratch that—just got your message. On it.
[09:34:41] <johnbender> Wilto: you never know if you'll run into some bramble and realize we should rethink adding this in
[09:34:56] <johnbender> gseguin: are you lurking?
[09:39:12] <toddmparker_> johnbender: I commented on that select pull
[09:39:42] <toddmparker_> i'd rather we just automatically drop corners on IE on dialogs so it just works
[09:40:17] <toddmparker_> we can target this in a smart way instead of adding an option nobody will use to nuke bottom corners on every platform
[09:40:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yay!
[09:40:33] <johnbender> I like that idea
[09:40:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: well
[09:40:57] <toddmparker_> we do this kind of finesse in other plugins
[09:41:03] <johnbender> except that it *probably* helps perf on other platforms too
[09:41:09] <toddmparker_> auto workaround issues for people
[09:41:13] <toddmparker_> i see
[09:41:28] <toddmparker_> think you asked for perf data, right?
[09:41:34] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah let me check something real fast
[09:41:37] <toddmparker_> kk
[09:41:43] <johnbender> not sure it cause a scrolling issue or just a load time issue
[09:41:47] <toddmparker_> i'm heading to lunch, be back in a bit
[09:41:56] <toddmparker_> ok, maybe give it a look
[09:42:01] <johnbender> kk
[09:42:50] <Wilto> Hey, just tuning-in on this.
[09:42:56] <Wilto> Is it the selector that’s crawlin’ in IE?
[09:43:12] <Wilto> Heh. “Selector.” “Crawling.”
[09:43:41] <johnbender> Wilto: not sure
[09:44:10] <Wilto> I’m just thinking, there are some changes there in dialog-refactor.
[09:44:36] <johnbender> Wilto: yah luckily the diff is small for this change
[09:44:48] <Wilto> I don’t assume it’s the bottom radii themselves causing the major slow-down, y’know? I’m targeting things in a different way in dialog-refactor, though it’s a little half-baked. Maybe it’s worth having a look at that.
[09:45:07] <Wilto> I’m also gonna be fixing the branches so they make sense today, come hell or high water.

[10:01:00] <gseguin> johnbender: 'sup?
[10:01:28] <johnbender> gseguin: I feel like I asked this question yesterday
[10:01:35] <gseguin> shoot
[10:01:37] <johnbender> gseguin: now that I'm thinking about it
[10:01:45] <johnbender> gseguin: synchronous load?
[10:01:56] <gseguin> of modules?
[10:01:59] <johnbender> gseguin: yes
[10:02:08] <gseguin> nope
[10:02:32] <gseguin> why would you want that? sync is bad for you
[10:02:35] <johnbender> gseguin: not possible because the deps are figured out along the way?
[10:02:40] <johnbender> gseguin: just to avoid the flash
[10:02:49] <johnbender> since we only care about dep management
[10:03:11] <johnbender> gseguin: and more importantly because I'm curious :D
[10:03:16] <gseguin> to avoid the flash just put the class ui-mobile-rendering on your <html>
[10:03:51] <johnbender> gseguin: that just blanks the content which is essentially the same thing
[10:03:57] <johnbender> I guess I'm wondering why I can't
[10:04:01] <johnbender> gseguin: either way
[10:04:05] <johnbender> not important
[10:04:11] <gseguin> but that's what we currently do though
[10:04:13] <johnbender> gseguin: you have been the victim of my curiousity twice now
[10:04:19] <gseguin> that's how we avoid the fouc
[10:04:31] <gseguin> because today
[10:04:34] <johnbender> gseguin: ah your right
[10:04:46] <johnbender> it just does it for you
[10:04:52] <gseguin> at the time our script is parsed/executed dom is not ready
[10:05:02] <johnbender> thats the diff
[10:05:09] <gseguin> 'xactly
[10:05:13] <johnbender> kk
[10:05:39] <johnbender> gseguin: alright I guess I'm going to look into dependencies and figuring out a way to test them today
[10:05:46] <gseguin> oh and I have a smart ass answer to the synchronous question: guess what the A of AMD stand for
[10:05:53] <johnbender> lawl
[10:05:54] <gseguin> ?
[10:05:57] <gseguin> :)
[10:06:29] <gseguin> there is one thing I did not have time to go through it's the tests
[10:06:29] <johnbender> gseguin: time to make a competing standard for pure dependency definition then :P
[10:06:33] <gseguin> I can do that tomorrow
[10:06:46] <johnbender> gseguin: did you have any thoughts?
[10:06:59] <johnbender> gseguin: ah you mean to replace the includes in the test pages
[10:07:07] <gseguin> indeed
[10:07:21] <gseguin> and actually use only the module your testing
[10:07:35] <gseguin> that'll test the dependencies at the same time
[10:07:37] <johnbender> right that was our solution to testing the module deps
[10:08:26] <gseguin> I'll get on it tomorrow
[10:09:16] <johnbender> in my mind our dependency graph looks like a couple of the core files as a small bramble of interdependency with a branch to each of the widgets
[10:09:26] <johnbender> and then a ton of the widgets pointing at button markup lol
[10:10:35] <gseguin> yeah
[10:10:49] <gseguin> there is one thing though
[10:11:17] <gseguin> is that controlgroup or buttonMarkup need to be loaded after some resources
[10:11:44] <gseguin> otherwise it messes up the order of execution of the pageshow listeners
[10:11:50] <gseguin> which messes up the UI
[10:12:06] <gseguin> there is no real way around that with AMD
[10:12:37] <gseguin> we may have to rethink how we add the pageshow listener
[10:12:56] <gseguin> and maybe add a weight to the listener we add
[10:13:17] <gseguin> and do the actual add at init time
[10:13:28] <gseguin> johnbender: ^ do I make sense?
[10:14:29] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm not clear on why those have to be loaded *after* some resources, I could see them needing to be loaded before since so much depends on them
[10:14:52] <gseguin> yeah but that's not the case
[10:15:04] <gseguin> I don't remember the details
[10:15:24] <gseguin> I'd have to look back at it
[10:15:29] <gseguin> try on the current code
[10:15:48] <gseguin> try moving ButtonMarkup above the resources that use it
[10:15:56] <gseguin> gotta run to standup
[10:16:16] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[10:18:14] <johnbender> gseguin: when you get back, I moved both of them above everything else in jquery.mobile.js without any issues, I'm not sure if that's what you meant by "moving above"

[10:38:21] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2539
[10:38:22] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by ArakTaiRoth (2m, 3w ago): rewriteBase
[10:38:38] <johnbender> did we ever figure out if that's the same issue as the other pull request
[10:38:48] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3273
[10:38:50] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by jguyomard (5d, 9h ago): Ajax and "base" tag
[10:38:52] <gseguin> oh the order in which you declare the dependencies in jquery.mobile.js does not matter
[10:39:09] <kinblas> johnbender: I don't get what he's trying to do, or what he means by re-write base ... though I haven't had time to look at it in detail. Did he have an associated issue?
[10:39:10] <johnbender> gseguin: thats what I figured
[10:39:30] <gseguin> johnbender: do that on master
[10:39:34] <johnbender> kinblas: no I think he wants jquery mobile to not mess with the base tag
[10:39:38] <gseguin> you'll see the problem
[10:39:46] <johnbender> gseguin: in the index.php I assume?
[10:39:54] <gseguin> indeed
[10:40:13] <gseguin> move ButtonMarkup above the form components for instance
[10:40:31] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to fetchlink: http://git.io/UZE9YQ
[10:40:31] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fetchlink] Temporarily removed fetchlink fade transition, added call to listview('refresh') if target element is a listview. - Mat Marquis
[10:41:44] <kinblas> johnbender: so why doesn't he just toggle $.support.dynamicBaseTag to false in mobile init?
[10:42:19] <kinblas> btw, they aren't the same issue
[10:43:53] <johnbender> gseguin: I moved it just above core and it seems to be ok
[10:43:56] <johnbender> need to click around
[10:44:18] <gseguin> hmm I was having all sorts of rendering problems
[10:44:23] <gseguin> let me find out
[10:44:30] <johnbender> gseguin: it's entirely possible I'm doing it wrong
[10:44:39] <johnbender> but worth a look
[10:45:15] <gseguin> but basically that's why you'll notice I did not put buttonMarkup as a dep on all the forms widgets
[10:48:14] <johnbender> gseguin: makes sense if they break when placed above them in the require order
[11:01:31] <gseguin> johnbender: oh I know, I was pulling just the required widget on a demo page
[11:02:03] <gseguin> you may not see it because you're pulling the kitchensink bundle
[11:02:22] <johnbender> I think that's what we should name it in the builder
[11:03:07] <johnbender> gseguin: how far did you look into it
[11:03:15] <johnbender> I'm wondering if that's worth figuring out
[11:03:22] <johnbender> though it's not likely to be a minor issue
[11:03:34] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't mind doing that
[11:03:36] <gseguin> I did figure out what was going on
[11:03:48] <gseguin> I can't remember it though
[11:03:56] * gseguin hates when that happens
[11:04:42] <johnbender> gseguin: for the test did you just put together a minimal test page and then just strip crap out of the index.ph?
[11:05:09] <gseguin> nope
[11:05:14] <gseguin> in the amd branch
[11:05:23] <gseguin> I picked up a demo page
[11:05:30] <gseguin> slider for instance
[11:05:52] <gseguin> and instead of requiring jquery.mobile
[11:06:04] <gseguin> I listed the widgets that are used in the page
[11:06:27] <gseguin> and I got some really interesting things
[11:06:33] <gseguin> let me send you a patch
[11:06:44] <johnbender> kk
[11:06:59] * gseguin has to write it first
[11:12:36] <gseguin> oh there is one more thing
[11:12:49] <gseguin> johnbender: who create $.mobile
[11:12:50] <gseguin> ?
[11:14:23] <gseguin> johnbender: I think right now it is created as a side effect of jquery.mobile.widget
[11:15:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I think so, yes
[11:15:47] <gseguin> that's wrong, that means that core has a dep on mobile.widget
[11:16:19] <johnbender> gseguin: indeed :(
[11:16:46] * gseguin just added it but feels dirty now
[11:18:31] <johnbender> gseguin: if there aren't other dependencies there that should be easy to fix
[11:18:55] <gseguin> indeed
[11:19:03] <toddmparker_> hey guys, i'm back
[11:19:12] <toddmparker_> this is such a bizarre thing to report: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3309
[11:19:13] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3309 on jquery-mobile, reported by chetankjain (4m, 13s ago): duplicated data-url for multiple pages
[11:19:31] <toddmparker_> sets both data-url to the same value. why would you ever do that??
[11:21:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it should be removing one of them
[11:21:33] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ahh they are embedded though
[11:21:33] <toddmparker_> removing the page or the url?
[11:21:37] <toddmparker_> yeah
[11:21:47] <toddmparker_> is he just trying to confuse the framework?
[11:21:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that will only happen with embedded pages
[11:21:56] <toddmparker_> right
[11:21:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: or should
[11:22:15] <toddmparker_> but it's like using the same ID on multiple things
[11:22:24] <toddmparker_> why??
[11:22:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm responding
[11:23:25] <toddmparker_> thanks
[11:23:27] <johnbender> I'm going to close it and tell him we'll reopen it if he can reproduce with ajax
[11:24:50] <gseguin> johnbender: I guess I must have been doing something wrong
[11:24:58] <gseguin> it works now
[11:25:10] <johnbender> gseguin: yar
[11:26:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to amd: http://git.io/c0ne4A
[11:26:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] Added temporary dependency on mobile.widget - Ghislain Seguin
[11:26:25] <johnbender> gseguin: that being moving buttonmarkup and controlgroup just below core?
[11:26:29] <johnbender> "that"
[11:26:56] <gseguin> let me send you the patch
[11:31:04] <gseguin> ok, so I guess I need to re-add the dep on buttonMarkup
[11:35:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to amd: http://git.io/tW4-Gw
[11:35:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] Added dep on "jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup" wherever needed - Ghislain Seguin
[11:39:19] <johnbender> gseguin: I can't wait until we have a really good understanding of dependencies
[11:39:41] <johnbender> your work has already highlighted a bunch of bizare crap
[11:40:19] <johnbender> and we can finally put that python command back in there for devs
[11:40:24] <johnbender> in the README
[11:42:53] <gseguin> johnbender: what python command?
[11:43:18] <gseguin> johnbender: got the patch?
[11:43:49] <johnbender> gseguin: I do
[11:44:10] <johnbender> gseguin: that's the minimum required for the slider sample page to work
[11:44:45] <gseguin> exactly
[11:44:52] <johnbender> gseguin: something that occurs to me
[11:45:09] <gseguin> start removing things and you'll see them not rendering anymore
[11:45:25] <johnbender> awesome
[11:45:56] <johnbender> the form widgets all have an implicit dependency on the parent page because of the keepNative functionality
[11:46:05] <johnbender> that is
[11:46:13] <johnbender> hrm
[11:46:29] <johnbender> well that's not entirely true
[11:47:30] <johnbender> nevermind
[11:50:06] <johnbender> I built it so it doesn't care if there's a parent page
[11:50:15] <johnbender> I'm glad I thought of that :P
[11:57:25] <johnbender> gseguin: https://gist.github.com/761d22b47c1ad5902249
[11:57:32] <johnbender> I lost it a little in my pants
[11:57:36] <johnbender> not gonna lie
[11:57:39] <johnbender> it's that awesome
[11:58:37] <Wilto> It just got real in here.

[11:59:52] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[11:59:54] <johnbender> so awesome
[12:00:04] <gseguin> heh !
[12:00:30] <Wilto> Previous image retracted; see instead: http://wil.to/_/mygod.gif
[12:00:39] <gseguin> I must have my path wrong it's not working for me
[12:01:08] <johnbender> gseguin: mines a subdir
[12:01:11] <johnbender> gseguin: /debug/
[12:01:54] <johnbender> gseguin: eh wtf
[12:02:11] <johnbender> in that gist I had too many parent dir refs (ie ../
[12:02:18] <gseguin> oh I got a script error
[12:02:28] <gseguin> missing buttonMarkup
[12:05:49] <johnbender> hrm
[12:06:06] <gseguin> yes?
[12:06:07] <johnbender> gseguin: thats odd I'm looking at the page now
[12:06:20] <johnbender> and the buttonMarkup is in there
[12:06:32] <gseguin> yeah same here
[12:06:33] <johnbender> the script tag referencing it
[12:06:40] <johnbender> timing issue?
[12:06:43] * johnbender shudders
[12:06:47] <gseguin> must have been a cache issue
[12:07:16] <johnbender> works in ff too
[12:08:28] <johnbender> cleared my cache works fine
[12:08:35] <johnbender> "it works for me" :/
[12:15:06] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm, one bummer about the test suite is that almost everything is wrapped in a page
[12:15:59] <johnbender> I suppose in the grand scheme of things that's not _terrible_ just not quite as good as it could be
[12:28:57] <johnbender> gseguin: it's already working
[12:29:04] <johnbender> at least sorting out the dependencies is
[12:51:04] <johnbender> gseguin: well I've got  the tests running even if it isn't pretty
[12:51:19] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll probably abstract the callback nesting into a helper
[12:51:28] <johnbender> callback nesting + qunit delay
[12:51:40] <johnbender> this is going to be brilliant for sorting out dep
[12:51:41] <johnbender> deps
[12:54:45] <johnbender> gseguin: just pushed two updates
[12:54:53] <johnbender> I'll keep running with this
[12:54:57] <johnbender> if that's cool with you
[12:55:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to amd: http://git.io/8xxpxA

[12:55:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] add transition dep to navigation - John Bender
[12:55:22] <johnbender> gseguin: also I'm not sure how you feel about array list formatting but I'm open to suggestions :/
[13:03:48] <toddmparker_> hi
[13:04:03] <toddmparker_> kinblas: you here?
[13:07:05] * gseguin catches up
[13:19:44] <toddmparker_> kinblas, gseguin or johnbender  - we're meeting tomorrow from 1-3 with some browser folks from Nokia to talk about a new browser they are working on...would any of you be interested in being dialed in?
[13:19:53] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah formatting is cool, though I would sort alphabetically the deps
[13:20:38] <gseguin> toddmparker_: sure, I'm sure that it'll be informative
[13:21:33] <toddmparker_> cool, knew you were on tomorrow...was hoping you could attend
[13:21:55] <toddmparker_> i just need to clear things with Nokia...can't remember if they require a NDA for this or not
[13:22:11] <toddmparker_> but i figure you guys would be a big help on the tech side
[13:23:40] <johnbender> gseguin: hah good idea
[13:24:48] <gseguin> johnbender: plus that should prevent people from thinking that the order has any sort of importance here
[13:25:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: arg I think I'm offline then
[13:25:32] <toddmparker_> it's ok, late notice
[13:25:43] <toddmparker_> i was just hoping one of you might want to listen in
[13:26:07] <johnbender> toddmparker_: just tell them I'll except a free n9 for my support efforts of the platform :D
[13:26:21] <toddmparker_> will do!
[13:26:24] <toddmparker_> i
[13:26:44] <gseguin> +1 ;)
[13:26:46] <toddmparker_> i can ask about getting phones for you guys
[13:27:34] <johnbender> toddmparker_: only if it actually makes sense for the project
[13:27:37] <johnbender> I was joking
[13:27:43] <johnbender> I just think the n9 is amazing
[13:28:44] <toddmparker_> it is nice. we got one with a blue case
[13:28:58] <toddmparker_> the only easily findable device we have in a sea of black
[13:29:00] <Wilto> Yeah, I’d totally wrangle a extra one of those “for testing” myself.
[13:29:05] <toddmparker_> i had to get a white iphone to cope
[13:29:37] <Wilto> I lose my wallet in there every couple of days. I wish I were kidding.
[13:29:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to amd: http://git.io/pOWrNQ
[13:29:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] alpha order deps - John Bender

[13:32:50] <toddmparker_> he is awesomesauce
[13:34:29] <Wilto> Lookin’ pretty badass so far. Just gotta update the docs.
[13:34:40] <Wilto> —AND WRITE TESTS DON’T HIT ME BENDER

[13:42:42] <toddmparker_> love that
[13:46:05] <toddmparker_> new textmate - boo

[13:46:17] <Wilto> WHAT
[13:46:33] <Wilto> oh got my eyes
[13:46:47] <johnbender> Wilto: challenge: find a gif of emacs slapping a beard onto textmate
[13:47:06] <Wilto> TextMate 2 is the _business_, man.
[13:47:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to amd: http://git.io/kH6elA
[13:47:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] added dialog to custom select deps - John Bender
[13:48:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: Wilto: just so everyone is clear I'm attempting to flesh out widget dependencies with the test suite
[13:49:00] <johnbender> gseguin has done an awesome thing here
[13:49:29] <toddmparker_> great, looked like you guys were mind melding over there
[13:49:39] <toddmparker_> how does it work?
[13:49:40] <Wilto> I’ve been seeing it in fits and starts, yeah. Looks pretty badass.
[13:49:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: s/mind melding/muddling through John's lack of brain power/
[13:50:48] <toddmparker_> nah
[14:06:50] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm thinking for each plugin we should explicitly list the dependencies required by actions in it's code
[14:07:18] <johnbender> this might be obvious but I thought I should say it
[14:08:33] <gseguin> johnbender: so you mean if widgetA is using widgetB in one of its method put widgetB in the deps
[14:08:34] <gseguin> ?
[14:08:53] <gseguin> deps of widgetA
[14:09:01] <johnbender> gseguin: well yes, but the more subtle case is something like $.mobile.activeBtnClass
[14:09:16] <johnbender> which might be required as a dep of widgetB
[14:09:23] <johnbender> but widgetA should still list it
[14:09:30] <johnbender> because widgetB might remove that dep
[14:09:45] <gseguin> oh yes absolutely
[14:09:49] <johnbender> kk
[14:10:03] <johnbender> gseguin: I know you just put together what was necessary for the monolithic build
[14:10:04] <gseguin> don't assume you have a resource if you haven't pulled it yourself
[14:10:12] <johnbender> but I thought I would make sure
[14:10:41] <johnbender> gseguin: good progress, the tests are finding the missing deps
[14:10:53] <johnbender> well
[14:10:54] <gseguin> yep I told you it needed a second pass
[14:11:28] <johnbender> super excited about this
[14:11:57] <johnbender> I've only ever had to alter the build order once before and it's hair raising
[14:12:10] <johnbender> and I  think that was before we had a good test suite
[14:12:26] <johnbender> assuming what we have now is "good"
[14:12:33] <johnbender> s/good/better than nothing/
[14:14:49] <toddmparker_> if it's catching the deps, it's pretty good
[14:14:59] <toddmparker_> issue is you never know what you aren't testing
[14:14:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's a good start
[14:15:07] <johnbender> in this case the integration slant of the test suite is a problem
[14:15:23] <johnbender> since it requires libraries that aren't strictly necessary
[14:15:41] <johnbender> because we're testing like a user
[14:22:52] <toddmparker_> right
[14:24:00] <toddmparker_> hey miketaylr
[14:24:19] <toddmparker_> we have a demo page up for the current state of the fixed toolbars: http://filamentgroup.com/tests/jqm-nativefixed/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html
[14:24:41] <toddmparker_> we're buttoning up a few more things, including just excluding opera mini and mobile for now
[14:25:50] <toddmparker_> but if you want to give this a whirl before we lock 'em out...
[14:26:06] <miketaylr> so what happens in an app in that case?
[14:27:05] <miketaylr> (makes sense for mini--totally different behavior there)
[14:31:29] <toddmparker_> miketaylr: what app scenario?
[14:31:46] <toddmparker_> we're just going to fail opera back to static toolbars
[14:31:49] <Wilto> Sounds like an action movie title.
[14:32:00] <miketaylr> ok
[14:32:40] <toddmparker_> tricky because mobile 11.5 (?) sort of works, but it's not true fixed
[14:32:45] <miketaylr> toddmparker_: opera mobile fixedpos is weird...but not totally broken (just jumpy, partially so smooth scrolling works). but it's your call :)
[14:33:00] <toddmparker_> all other versions present a usability issue if you have position:fixed elements on the page
[14:33:05] <miketaylr> yeah
[14:33:16] <Wilto> I blame you personally as usual, miketaylr.
[14:33:37] <miketaylr> guess i can just paste in your evil ua sniffings in the bug in hopes of motivating people :)
[14:33:38] <toddmparker_> yeah, i personally prefer it to either work well or not at all because it's sort of distracting
[14:33:45] <miketaylr> cool
[14:33:58] <toddmparker_> think we have a window object, but you're right
[14:34:03] <toddmparker_> blacklisting is bad
[14:34:12] * miketaylr is just kidding
[14:34:23] <miketaylr> but srsly, i'll let them know we need to get it right
[14:34:24] <toddmparker_> android 2.1 is going to need a good old UA sniff
[14:34:35] <toddmparker_> yeah, then we can switch you over
[14:34:41] <toddmparker_> that's why i want to keep tabs
[14:35:06] <toddmparker_> i'd be curious to hear if the mini team can simply chance it's rendering on the server to ignore pos:fixed
[14:35:07] <miketaylr> "stop eating horse burgers and fix position:fixed"
[14:35:12] <toddmparker_> heh
[14:35:15] <toddmparker_> ewww
[14:35:20] <miketaylr> so sad :'(
[14:35:45] <toddmparker_> since everything goes thru your proxy for mini, can that kind of change happen across the board?
[14:35:54] <miketaylr> yeah
[14:36:01] <Wilto> Broken position: fixed _and_ eating horses? You’ve just invented the perfect storm of people I want to punch in the eye, miketaylr.
[14:36:08] <miketaylr> just depends on if it would break sites elsewhere
[14:36:17] <toddmparker_> just seems like the first thing you'd test and then say" nope, we don't understand fixed"
[14:36:25] <johnbender> I take issue with looking down on people for consuming horse flesh
[14:36:29] <toddmparker_> i guess it could
[14:36:32] <johnbender> cow or horse
[14:36:34] <johnbender> either way
[14:36:42] <toddmparker_> but it might un-break a lot more sites
[14:36:42] <johnbender> it just a farm animal
[14:36:47] <miketaylr> toddmparker_: yeah
[14:36:49] <toddmparker_> (that's a word, it is)
[14:36:54] <Wilto> johnbender: http://wil.to/_/joker-ha.jpg
[14:36:57] <miketaylr> unbreak my heart, etc.
[14:37:04] <Wilto> You see that dude right there. That is my bro, johnbender.
[14:37:14] <toddmparker_> etc. yes
[14:37:18] <Wilto> Do not eat my pets please.
[14:37:33] <johnbender> as long as you are consistent
[14:37:39] <johnbender> Wilto: do you eat beef?
[14:37:43] <toddmparker_> seems worth kicking upstairs..be curious if some sites are unusable n mini b/c of this
[14:37:47] <Wilto> Well, no, but unrelated.
[14:37:56] <johnbender> fair enough
[14:38:05] <toddmparker_> maybe they have someone negating pos:fixed rules on your side for important sites so mini is happy
[14:38:24] <miketaylr> toddmparker_: any way you guys or someone could file a bug or send me an email (miket@opera.com) about that?
[14:38:38] <miketaylr> i'm in the middle of a move to austin, so i'm afriad i'll let it slide for a few days... then forget

[15:02:41] <Wilto> Hey, uh…
[15:03:09] <Wilto> Nobody did the button() vs. buttonMarkup() normalization stuff we’d kind of discussed previously, did they?
[15:03:20] <johnbender> Wilto: not that I know of
[15:03:21] <Wilto> http://jsbin.com/ukewu3/201 should not work as it does.
[15:04:02] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b0c1acae4dc558f1241fb9231782587a0dd97575
[15:04:03] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by johnbender (2m ago): alter select index tests to use async load
[15:04:35] <Wilto> Should it? toddmparker_ and I could swear this was busted not too long ago.
[15:05:39] <toddmparker_> Wilto: can you post that jsbin here?
[15:06:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: he did
[15:06:17] <Wilto> Already did, couple lines up.
[15:06:17] <johnbender> unless there's another one
[15:06:18] <gseguin> johnbender: oh you're going AMD all the way! I like
[15:06:33] <johnbender> gseguin: I figure that's the only way to tell if there's breakage
[15:06:37] <johnbender> well
[15:06:41] <johnbender> not strictly
[15:06:47] <johnbender> at least the fastest way
[15:07:20] <johnbender> I suppose we should do this with the built version using the dependency definitions when the time comes
[15:07:27] <johnbender> whatever
[15:07:33] <johnbender> not that worried about it
[15:08:03] <johnbender> gseguin: anyway you can see all the commits before that that alter the deps list
[15:08:06] <johnbender> super win
[15:08:17] <johnbender> I'm hoping/thinking the custom select will be one of the uglier ones
[15:08:22] <gseguin> yeah I saw that's awesome
[15:09:08] <gseguin> next is : putting some thoughts toward the download builder
[15:09:21] <gseguin> me thinks no.de service
[15:09:33] <gseguin> is too ambitious?
[15:09:46] <gseguin> s/is/is it/
[15:10:15] <johnbender> as long as it can pipe through the closure compiler
[15:10:41] <gseguin> no love for UglifyJS ?
[15:10:54] <johnbender> gseguin: I have evil plans for the closure compiler
[15:10:56] <toddmparker_> ok, that's odd
[15:10:59] <gseguin> much easier to use inside node.js
[15:11:04] <johnbender> gseguin: but we could use either really
[15:11:08] <toddmparker_> should I close these button disable issues then?
[15:11:16] <johnbender> gseguin: in fact it doesn't really matter for the download builder
[15:11:29] <toddmparker_> johnbender: do you want to give this a look to see why this is working??
[15:11:30] <johnbender> the only reason I care about the closure  compiler is the type checking
[15:11:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm working on dependencies toddmparker_
[15:11:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I certainly can though :D
[15:11:59] <johnbender> Wilto: what's the actual issue?
[15:13:06] <toddmparker_> so the issue was that if you have a link with a data-role="button" then tried to disable it via the button plugin method, it used to actually re-wrap the link button in another set of buttonmarkup
[15:13:40] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3141#issuecomment-3226627
[15:13:41] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3141 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (4w, 52m ago): Prevent data-role="button" from double enhancing buttons or inputs
[15:14:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: thats .button not .buttonMarkup right? :P
[15:14:32] <toddmparker_> right
[15:14:46] <johnbender> toddmparker_: is that in a specific context?
[15:14:49] <toddmparker_> people would try to use all the button methods on link buttons
[15:14:50] <johnbender> eg a form
[15:15:13] <toddmparker_> i guess we need some test coverage on this
[15:15:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so link buttons are supposed to be buttonMarkup then?
[15:15:29] <johnbender> and not .button
[15:15:38] <toddmparker_> yes, because it's just about decorating the link
[15:15:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: is that just a reality of the widget factory?
[15:15:56] <toddmparker_> but because it looked like a button, people were expecting they could use button methods
[15:16:12] <toddmparker_> and it used to break things
[15:16:15] <johnbender> .buttonMarkup().button('disable') == .buttonMarkup().button() ?
[15:16:19] <toddmparker_> but mat's example works
[15:16:41] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/ukewu3/201
[15:16:57] <toddmparker_>  $("#mytest").button().button('disable');
[15:17:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sure
[15:17:20] <johnbender> that should work as normal
[15:17:23] <toddmparker_> that used to cause the link button to get wrapped in another set of button markup
[15:17:33] <johnbender> I thought you said the problem was buttonMarkup().button()
[15:17:45] <toddmparker_> no, button
[15:17:54] <toddmparker_> most people don't know what buttonMarkup is
[15:18:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: well so far as I understand it that method will always ignore the _create method a second time
[15:18:50] <toddmparker_> something used to be different
[15:18:54] <toddmparker_> great it works tho
[15:19:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you guys have a broken example?
[15:19:58] <toddmparker_> looking for one
[15:21:55] <toddmparker_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6438659/how-to-disable-a-link-button-in-jquery-mobile
[15:22:44] <toddmparker_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5875025/disable-buttons-in-jquery-mobile
[15:22:48] <toddmparker_> i need to look into this
[15:22:50] <toddmparker_> so odd
[15:23:07] <toddmparker_> i know this wasn't working but finding old issues is a pain
[15:23:15] <toddmparker_> i'll get back to you johnbender
[15:23:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so here's my recommendation
[15:23:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I would check out a really old version of the library
[15:24:00] <johnbender> and try and reproduce
[15:24:03] <johnbender> if you can get it to break
[15:24:07] <johnbender> you can do a bisect
[15:24:12] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:24:19] <toddmparker_> i was just testing with B3 and it's ok
[15:24:20] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/ukewu3/203/edit#javascript,html
[15:24:23] <toddmparker_> whut?
[15:24:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://progit.org/book/ch6-5.html
[15:24:43] <johnbender> see Binary Search
[15:24:50] <toddmparker_> ok
[15:24:55] <johnbender> that will find the bug for you if you can find both a good commit and a bad commit
[15:25:04] <toddmparker_> i wonder if mat's is working because he's doing this on ready
[15:25:08] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:25:09] <toddmparker_> ok
[15:25:19] <toddmparker_> heading out guys, g'night!
[15:25:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: cool
[15:25:26] <johnbender> safe travels
[16:56:32] <johnbender> gseguin: woot
[16:56:37] <johnbender> found a bug in the page plugin
[16:57:05] <gseguin> heh, thanks to AMD ?
[16:57:11] <johnbender> gseguin: sort of
[16:57:28] <johnbender> sometimes when you jiggle the tests you shake loose a few assumptions
[17:02:56] <johnbender> oh yah
[17:03:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 4 new commits to amd: http://git.io/RHH-xA

[17:08:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] added note to test helper - John Bender
[17:17:30] <gseguin> johnbender: the swarminject thing might be broken if it was expecting tests to have been registered by the time it runs
[18:12:21] <johnbender> gseguin: very true
[18:12:29] <johnbender> gseguin: we can just add that to the list
[18:13:21] <johnbender> in the aync load
[18:13:24] <johnbender> *asyncLoad

[20:00:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/new-transitions] incomplete prototype for a new transition style - scottjehl
[20:00:50] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl force-pushed css-fixed from f80904a to 5de358b: http://git.io/j2KOFw

[20:00:50] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/css-fixed] added new script and associated styles for handling "fixed" toolbars using native support for CSS position: fixed, where possible. Non-supporting platforms will fall back to inline positioning, either by gracefully degrading on their own or by opting them out through a blacklist (fixed positioning detection's got issues...). - scottjehl
