[07:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I saw you marked http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6980 as open, but I also noticed https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/76
[07:45:49] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: Yes, so that's a good one to discuss. In general, zoom sucks, because it screws with getComputedStyle
[07:47:26] <mikesherov> But http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6980 has a patch to avoid it. Its likely a can of worms though. I'm fine doing wontfix and adding something to docs... Let me know.
[07:53:26] <mikesherov> Yeah, I'm closing it
[07:58:38] <mikesherov> Wontfix'd: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6980#comment:4
[08:44:53] <gnarf> rxaviers: the == null is the only exception to our strict === & !== in the style guide
[08:45:41] <gnarf> ?tell zjs don't worry about fixing the history, when we merge a pull, we squash it generally
[08:47:05] <rxaviers> ok thks corey

[13:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: It's kind of unfortunate becaue zooming is good for accessibility.
[13:05:10] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: We can revisit. The fix is kinda hacky
[13:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> We should talk to the browser vendors about fixing their code :-)
[13:05:58] <mikesherov> Yes
[13:06:04] <mikesherov> Tell goog
[13:06:38] <mikesherov> I'm going to clean up sortable next. Anything I should know?
[13:08:38] <agcolom> Hi!
[13:10:26] <agcolom> quick question: how about having a google map with  a marker for each team member...
[13:10:39] <agcolom> (crazy idea or cool idea?)
[13:11:07] <agcolom> (btw I am volunteering for this! ;-) )
[13:12:07] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez mikesherov gnarf ^
[13:12:32] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Nothing I can think of, other than it's a pile of messy code :-P
[13:12:54] <gnarf> ajpiano: ^^^^
[13:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Seems good to me. I made one for appendTo a while ago.
[13:13:13] <gnarf> sounds "devrel" to me ;)
[13:13:22] <gnarf> but +1
[13:13:34] <agcolom> really? (I was thinking data in XML then XSLT to tranform)
[13:14:04] <gnarf> surely, we are responsible JSON hackers around here nowadays
[13:14:05] <gnarf> :)
[13:14:51] <ajpiano> mikesherov: have you done draggable and droppable already?
[13:14:52] <agcolom> I'll get a demo done and show you then... then take it from there?
[13:14:57] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't use any data source, I just manually placed pins on the map :-)
[13:15:16] <ajpiano> agcolom: where would it live?
[13:15:26] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, do you think that's the approach I should use?
[13:15:37] <agcolom> ajpiano: team page?
[13:15:49] <scott_gonzalez> If there's a way to load a data source, that seems better.
[13:15:49] <agcolom> (well a link on the team page?)
[13:16:47] <ajpiano> +1 for datasource, i wonder what it could be
[13:16:55] <agcolom> The only thing is I don't know node, so I use php to run the tranformation
[13:17:00] <agcolom> just XML?
[13:17:22] <gnarf> JSON -- its like the initiation, you pull request yourself into the team json file?
[13:17:58] <ajpiano> can't help the feeling shouldn't do anything in current .org, do it in the jquery.org repo
[13:18:06] <ajpiano> gnarf: nah
[13:18:14] <agcolom> (XML of people with data such as name, nickname, team(s), location, picture,)
[13:18:36] <ajpiano> in an ideal world, people's accounts on jquery.com would just be denoted with team membe
[13:18:47] <ajpiano> and the entire team page would be generated in wp :p
[13:18:57] <gnarf> okay
[13:19:03] <gnarf> now we need to loop like koop or nacin in
[13:19:04] <gnarf> darn
[13:19:05] <gnarf> :)
[13:19:33] <gnarf> but ajpiano that is actually an ideal idea
[13:19:37] <ajpiano> just seems like it would be easier to do with more infra involved
[13:19:46] <ajpiano> i mean, with more open questions solved
[13:20:23] <ajpiano> showing data on a gmap isn't particularly a crazy lift, where that data actually comes from - getting people's lat & long etc
[13:20:27] <ajpiano> that's the hard part :p
[13:20:49] <agcolom> just get people to give an address or even a town
[13:20:55] <ajpiano> same thing :p
[13:20:56] <agcolom> it's good enough
[13:21:03] <gnarf> still the hard part
[13:21:04] <gnarf> :)
[13:21:05] <mikesherov> Yeah but we need that anyway
[13:21:14] <mikesherov> CLA takes care if that
[13:21:21] <ajpiano> oh hmm
[13:21:26] <gnarf> we don't sign CLAs
[13:21:29] <gnarf> we sign CAAs
[13:21:29] <ajpiano> scraping from the CLA data might be a good idea
[13:21:31] <mikesherov> CAA
[13:21:31] <ajpiano> same diff
[13:21:36] <gnarf> and I don't think that had my "town" on it
[13:21:38] <mikesherov> Same diff exactly
[13:22:28] <ajpiano> i think it's a great idea, but i just think that it should be a simple view of some data we have once we have it, rather than putting the cart before the horse is all
[13:23:37] <agcolom> ajpiano: ok. Let me put something together then with a few examples, and then I'll share it with you and see what you think...
[13:23:38] <mikesherov> Yeah
[13:24:22] <agcolom> Next week will be totally crazy with work, but I hope to have something for the following week...
[13:24:52] <ajpiano> agcolom: https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/issues/24
[13:25:19] <agcolom> ajpiano: you are a star! Thank you so much!
[13:25:30] <ajpiano> :)
[13:25:34] <danheberden> we should give ajpiano a gold star
[13:26:07] <agcolom> Definitely!
[13:27:26] <agcolom> it's nearly bedtime for me... have a great evening/afternoon everyone... and thanks again a such a wonderful 4 days!
[13:30:15] <ajpiano> gnite agcolom !!
[13:36:53] <gnarf> agcolom: *hugs* night! can't wait for the next meeting!

[23:13:41] <delight> Is it only me or is the demo for the localized date picker not working any longer ? http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#localization
