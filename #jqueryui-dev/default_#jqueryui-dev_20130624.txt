[05:01:00] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, `copy:dist_units_images` (from build task) is used by unit tests? Shall we add `build` as part of `test` task then? = grunt.registerTask( "test", [ "build", "qunit" ] )?
[05:08:14] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: please post something like that on GitHub. Needs a bit more persistence then IRC
[05:08:40] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: anyway, no, its fine as-is. The checkbox is only clickable in the browser, with phantomjs you can't enable that anyway
[05:09:07] <rxaviers> I can squish our conv there
[05:09:27] <jzaefferer> some other time ;)
[05:09:45] <jzaefferer> with mobile people in here, its much easier to loose notification lines
[05:09:46] <rxaviers> (I mean squeeze)
[05:10:14] <arschmitz> sure sure its all our fault blame it on on mobile :)
[05:10:28] <rxaviers> lol
[05:10:31] <jzaefferer> heh :p
[05:11:15] <jzaefferer> I actually got notified about a mention in irc last week, but had to go to irc.jquery.com to actually read it, since my client just threw the buffer away after a few pages
[05:11:32] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I've `grep "dist" -R` on tests path, the only thing I see is:
[05:11:33] <rxaviers> includeStyle( "dist/jquery-ui.min.css" );
[05:11:38] <rxaviers> includeScript( "dist/jquery-ui.min.js" );
[05:12:45] <rxaviers> by tests/unit/testsuite.js
[05:13:14] <rxaviers> anyway, I just want to double check with you dist usage by tests
[05:13:21] <jzaefferer> yeah, but that css file has relative images urls
[05:13:33] <rxaviers> aha I see
[05:13:52] <rxaviers> so, it's appropriate to add build to test isnt it?
[05:14:18] <jzaefferer> no, `grunt test` never needs those images
[05:14:33] <rxaviers> it's only a visual thing?
[05:14:45] <rxaviers> what about  includeScript( "dist/jquery-ui.min.js" );
[05:15:46] <jzaefferer> only runs when QUnit.urlParams.min is true
[05:16:07] <jzaefferer> not happening for `grunt test`
[05:16:29] <rxaviers> ok
[05:18:45] <rxaviers> thks

[05:54:20] <agcolom> toddmparker: uGoMobi arschmitz _|Nix|_ I think one of us should reply to https://twitter.com/taitems/status/348748809439940608 
[05:54:35] <arschmitz> agcolom: i saw that not really sure what to say though
[05:54:45] <agcolom> same here...
[05:54:56] <arschmitz> agcolom: they are not discontinuing it because of us its just because they dont want to update it to ios 7
[05:55:30] <agcolom> yes... would be nice though if someone did an ios 7 theme
[05:57:59] <arschmitz> yup
[05:58:19] <arschmitz> but i almost think that the current ios theme should not be updated to it if it were up to me
[05:58:27] <arschmitz> some people might still like the old ios look
[05:58:49] <arschmitz> would be cool if it was completely seperate
[05:58:58] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes, I agree 
[06:00:07] <arschmitz> maybe some one will do it
[06:00:27] <arschmitz> agcolom: when you get a second can i get the number off that WP
[06:00:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not sure if your back yet but if you are goodmorning
[06:00:49] <agcolom> oh, yes, will go get that now...
[06:02:15] <agcolom> arschmitz: is it ok to post here or better by email?

[06:04:08] <arschmitz> ah ok i couldnt remember when he was coming back
[06:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm back!

[06:46:24] <agcolom> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez I have a PR to turn qunit signature from green to purple... Here is what it looks like at the moment: http://api.qunitjs.com/deepEqual/
[06:46:39] <agcolom> the PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/240
[06:48:34] <jzaefferer> agcolom: looks good. Thanks for the notification, made me realise I'm not watching jquery-wp-content
[06:48:48] <agcolom> jzaefferer: you're welcome :-)
[06:49:31] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It's in my inbox, which is down to 180 now...
[06:50:12] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: That's incredible! You're definitely the inbox master!
[06:50:48] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It's already merged.
[06:51:02] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, jzaefferer just did it.
[06:51:08] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: magic!
[06:51:13] <scott_gonzalez> He did it faster than I clicked on the link.
[06:51:20] <jzaefferer> its live, even
[06:51:20] <scott_gonzalez> So that was a bit confusing :-P
[06:51:43] <agcolom> even more magic!
[06:52:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, that's what confused me. I clicked the link for the live site and it was purple.
[06:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> So I was wondering what the PR changed.
[06:52:44] <jzaefferer> heh
[06:52:55] <jzaefferer> gnarf's pr and pr-clean commands are awesome
[06:53:04] <jzaefferer> no more remotes juggling
[06:53:20] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: the signature box had the mobile green
[06:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, they're really nice.
[06:55:05] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: BTW you're also signed in as jzaefferer_, which is making tab completion painful.
[06:56:50] <jzaefferer> uh, okay
[06:56:51] <jzaefferer> that's odd
[07:00:11] <jzaefferer> and he's gone :-)
[07:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:08:35] <agcolom> arschmitz: are you still around?
[07:08:43] <arschmitz> yup
[07:08:49] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I'm testing the new release script now (PR 951)
[07:08:55] <agcolom> I'm documenting activePage 
[07:09:16] <rxaviers> :)
[07:09:22] <arschmitz> ok
[07:09:32] * rxaviers is working on DB - Support 1.11
[07:09:40] <agcolom> what type is it?
[07:09:58] <agcolom> Reference to the page currently in view.
[07:10:22] <agcolom> also, was that added in 1.0?
[07:10:45] <arschmitz> agcolom: it returns a dom node for the current active page
[07:11:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: and ill have to look when it was added but 1.0 sounds right
[07:11:07] <agcolom> arschmitz: great. thanks
[07:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Don't believe arschmitz :-)
[07:11:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's a jQuery object, not a DOM Element.
[07:11:37] <arschmitz> yeah i lie about everything
[07:11:49] <agcolom> ok, thanks :-)
[07:12:03] <jzaefferer> 3 more, and jQuery UI will have 250 authors :-)
[07:12:09] <scott_gonzalez> And yes, it existed in 1.0.
[07:12:25] <agcolom> oh I need to do a qui ui PR then ;-)
[07:12:30] <agcolom> quick UI ^
[07:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> Oh wonderful, now I can get distracted by all the little Mobile questions like this :-P
[07:13:06] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: as arschmitz said earlier today, blame it on the mobile guys!
[07:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> That plan sounds good to me.
[07:13:37] <agcolom> yes, sorry I'm not normally online at this time... just no school today, so I'm at home :-)
[07:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> Just for the record, https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/36#issuecomment-14197092 (read below the <hr>) is still how I feel.

[07:15:31] <scott_gonzalez> So just expect some snarky remarks whenever someone complains about AMD :-P
[07:19:06] * rxaviers is looking forward our next style (perhaps topcoat) talk :)
[07:21:09] <rxaviers> using a third party may externalize (at least) the Sass/LESS/Stylus discussion
[07:22:40] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I just ran the release script from master to verify the current output. It fails with this message: "This script is not smart enough to handle the 1.10.0 release." - what's going on there?
[07:24:04] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: did you run this to test?
[07:24:39] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: probably not, since the authors check would already have failed
[07:24:47] <rxaviers> how did you fetch the script?
[07:26:10] <jzaefferer> as the wiki page describes, from master
[07:26:20] <jzaefferer> as a reference to compare to
[07:27:13] <rxaviers> ok.. the master's doesnt support 1.10.*
[07:27:57] <rxaviers> to use master's release script, I guess you'll need to with a 1.9.* jquery-ui or skip the version calculation manually
[07:28:09] <rxaviers> to play* with
[07:29:28] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: how do I skip it manually?
[07:29:36] <rxaviers> commenting out the lines :P
[07:30:05] <rxaviers> and setting it manually, *version*variables* = 1.10.. something like that
[07:31:10] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: jsut to confirm, did you do this before?
[07:31:27] <jzaefferer> *just
[07:31:48] <rxaviers> yeap.. let me open it again and see exactly how the manual thing would look like
[07:33:04] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: that would help a lot. I haven't worked with the script in a long time
[07:36:46] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5850493
[07:37:12] <rxaviers> plz just let me know on any trouble
[07:38:26] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay. Running it again now, with a separate repo.
[07:38:31] <jzaefferer> new script already finished
[08:51:40] <agcolom> could someone please let me know if the example for activePage is satisfactory? (http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.activePage/)
[08:55:09] <agcolom> arschmitz: ^
[08:55:35] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah i think so
[08:55:41] <agcolom> great, thanks :-)
[08:55:50] <agcolom> will tag and deploy... 
[08:55:55] <arschmitz> cool
[09:03:10] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: The example description is wrong.
[09:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> The example code also strays from our standards.
[09:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> line 43 has an extra space after "$(" and is missing a space in "function(){"
[09:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> Line 46 shouldn't use String().
[09:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> Line 45 should use double quotes.
[09:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> And the indentation on lines 46-48 are wrong.
[09:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> The use of a paragraph inside the page content is also strange.
[09:08:28] <scott_gonzalez> Also, <br> not <br />
[09:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> We don't write XHTML.
[09:09:37] <scott_gonzalez> line 11 is missing a space before the {
[09:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> Line 15 is indented too far.
[09:35:54] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: iv got a quick question for you
[09:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I'm listening :-)
[09:36:54] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: what would cause a method called as a handler in ._on to end up with its context as window and not the widget
[09:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing I can think of is either using $.proxy()/fn.bind or wrapping the actual function in setTimeout().
[09:39:43] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: hmmm none of those are the case here ill stare a bit more and see if i cant see myself doing something egregious i'm not seeing now. 
[09:42:19] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: If you can reduce it, I can take a look as well.
[09:43:00] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah ill make a test case if i cant figure it out its got to be something stupid though there is nothing special going on 
[09:45:25] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: on the lines of looking at things though i went to review the mobile textinput widget this weekend and ended up pretty much rewriting and sense form widgets is one of the things that is going to be in both id like you to take a look once i finish it up
[09:45:48] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:46:17] <arschmitz> ill give you a pr link once im to a good place with it
[09:47:25] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: had not really intended to re-write but was not left with a lot of choice after looking at it :(
[09:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> You gotta do what you gotta do, right?
[09:48:00] <arschmitz> had only 3 methods _create _enable and _disable
[09:48:26] <arschmitz> and used a lot of .bind .focus(function(){}) etc .on()
[09:48:42] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yup pretty much
[10:13:36] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, glad you're back. One quick question. Where's "effects-core.html"? :)
[10:13:39] <rxaviers> On api.jqueryui.com, when I `grunt build-xml-entries`, I dont see it on `dist/wordpress/posts/post/`.
[10:16:32] <rxaviers> (should I expect it to be created? Current ui.effect.jquery.json manifest points to docs at effects-core path)
[10:20:31] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, thanks. will fix that this evening...
[10:20:49] <agcolom> (in about 1.5h or so I hope).
[10:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: effects-core is a category, not an entry.
[10:22:11] <scott_gonzalez> There is no effects-core.html
[10:23:56] <rxaviers> My question is simply due to DB, for every docs entries I get its correspondent .html file. Should we skip it for ui.effect.jquery.json (core) then?
[10:24:06] <rxaviers> corresponding*
[10:27:35] <rxaviers> (clarification: we dont have this file included in current package. In the generalization re-write (getting this info from manifests), this is supposed to be included. But, it seems we need to skip it for core)
[10:31:03] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Ah, ok. We'll just expose this via the _ prop in the upcoming update.
[10:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: We'll want to have the _.docs array list all of the entries on http://api.jqueryui.com/category/effects-core/
[10:32:35] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Do you get a similar issue for ui.core ?
[10:33:14] <rxaviers> So, instead of adding a category html, we'll add each of its children pages. Ok
[10:34:40] <jzaefferer> Running "generate_themes" task \n Warning: object is not a function Use --force to continue.
[10:34:47] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: release from master failed with this ^
[10:35:12] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: it installed download.jqueryui.com@1.10.3-4
[10:35:59] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, yeap, I get. Thanks ;)
[10:38:17] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, current wont work with DB@1.10.3-4 :'(..
[10:38:31] <rxaviers> current (release script)*
[10:38:32] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/951#issuecomment-19922691
[10:39:18] <jzaefferer> I think we need CI for that release script
[10:39:31] <jzaefferer> whenever DB changes, make a dry run for the release
[10:39:47] <jzaefferer> realizing its broken whenever we make a release is terrible
[10:40:08] <jzaefferer> I mean, if we'd need to do a 1.10.3 right it, we couldn't
[10:40:29] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: is there any way to run the release script to completion?
[10:40:49] <rxaviers> Current DB have transition changes to 1.11
[10:41:34] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: there's if ( exec( "npm install download.jqueryui.com" ).code !== 0 ) { in the release script. I can modify that to specify the version to install
[10:41:40] <rxaviers> Ideally, release script should install a certain version of DB. Not the latest
[10:41:47] <jzaefferer> yes
[10:41:55] <jzaefferer> that would avoid this kind of problem
[10:42:04] <jzaefferer> which version should work for master?
[10:42:08] <rxaviers> yeap :)
[10:42:17] <rxaviers> 1.10.3-3
[10:42:19] <rxaviers> let me double check
[10:42:21] <jzaefferer> uh
[10:42:23] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:42:36] <jzaefferer> oh well, the version there isn't semver
[10:42:45] <jzaefferer> makes sense for a build number to make a (big) difference
[10:42:49] <rxaviers> double checked
[10:43:13] <rxaviers> it's not following semver unfortunately.
[10:43:54] <jzaefferer> whatever, let's just set a fixed version number
[10:44:05] <jzaefferer> more CI would be good as well
[10:44:19] <jzaefferer> but having a specific version in the code should make a big difference
[10:45:05] <rxaviers> I should have called 1.10.3-4 => 1.11.0pre
[10:45:55] <jzaefferer> right
[10:46:13] <rxaviers> deleting this tag remotely is something worth?
[10:46:27] <rxaviers> if you are ok with it, I will do it right ahead
[10:58:30] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I don't think that's a good idea. It won't fix the current release script anyway. 
[10:58:42] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: deleting tags is only useful when no one had a chance to fetch it yet
[10:58:53] <jzaefferer> otherwise they're going to show up again once someone else pushes
[11:00:17] <rxaviers> two things right? to fix the current release script: we need to control DB installation at a specific version (independently if it's 1.10.3-4 or 1.11.0pre0)
[11:01:14] <rxaviers> about deleting current remote 1.10.3-4 tag, I agree with you. It makes things hard if someone have already pulled it. Although, he should check the tags he might later push before actually pushing
[11:01:27] <rxaviers> :P
[11:02:35] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: re: Line 45 should use double quotes.
[11:02:40] <agcolom> did you mean line 40?
[11:02:50] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/8e1c6401d4b85794b459a564b668f0794802def7
[11:03:24] <rxaviers> anyway, if we're sticking ith 1.10.3-4... Do you want me to commit that change now, so you can keep testing it? Or you would like to add it locally, finish testing and let me know?
[11:03:51] <rxaviers> the change I refer to is: adding @1.10.3-3 to the current `npm install  download.jqueryui.com`
[11:03:53] <jzaefferer> rxaviers scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/951#issuecomment-19924362
[11:04:04] <jzaefferer> it's fine for now
[11:04:13] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I meant 45, I was referring to line numbers in the rendered example.
[11:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> But yes, 40 in the source.
[11:05:05] <agcolom> ok, great. I'm ready to push to stage... I hope I got it right this time! (I'm scared ;-) )
[11:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> So echofon stopped working...I guess I'm done with Twitter...
[11:05:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, you already did it ;) cool ..
[11:08:16] <rxaviers> jzaefferer thanks for reviewing it
[11:10:57] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, there's only one effects core child doc I did not find on build-xml-entries = color-animation.html
[11:11:58] <rxaviers> (it's referenced by the effects-core category)
[11:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: It's in pages/ not entries/
[11:19:49] <rxaviers> clarification: I found no color-animation on `dist/wordpress/posts/post`
[11:20:03] <rxaviers> is color-animation.html supposed to exist?
[11:20:22] <rxaviers> It's referenced at http://api.jqueryui.com/category/effects-core/
[11:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be in dist/wordpress/posts/page

[11:40:51] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[11:48:27] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: can I have your view on some html indentation/formatting?
[11:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[11:49:19] <agcolom> thanks. If you look at: http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.activePage/
[11:49:23] <agcolom> sorry
[11:49:26] <agcolom> stage
[11:49:46] <agcolom> http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.activePage/
[11:50:13] <agcolom> are you happy with the indentation?
[11:50:18] <scott_gonzalez> 46-48 is still indented too far.
[11:50:34] <agcolom> oh yes, sorry
[11:51:14] <agcolom> apart from that, are you happy with the html indentation?
[11:51:36] <agcolom> (I've had to change the template, so I'll have to revisit all the entries...
[11:51:57] <agcolom> Would prefer to do that only once, as that's about 70+ entries
[11:52:29] <agcolom> Do you think it's a good idea to have a line around each page (for clarity)
[11:56:28] <scott_gonzalez> Why is the CDATA indented in the example?
[11:57:01] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/1091b2d79ae7cc551ae0351d49323b8ccff6ea2b#L0R37
[11:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> The source should look like: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries/accordion.xml#L184-L188
[11:59:25] <agcolom> ok, will fix that
[12:10:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: does that look ok now? https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/c10ce195159ec83a37bde463c4f8972bd6eeba25/entries/jQuery.mobile.activePage.xml
[12:28:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Ok, I've found why I didn't initially indent the first div and the script tags in the body. It's because in UI, that is not indented: http://api.jqueryui.com/addClass/
[12:30:09] <agcolom> which one should I follow? (should I follow UI and have the first div under body at the same level as body (and also have script at the same level as body) or should that get indented in UI?
[12:38:37] <agcolom> ok, by looking around, it seems that we do not indent 1st level under body... 
[12:38:45] <agcolom> so will change my examples...
[13:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: The answer for all your indentation questions are answered here: http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/html/ :-)
[13:08:08] <agcolom> that's what I was looking for but couldn't find it!

[14:21:08] <toddmparker> Hi all, how goes?
[14:50:50] <agcolom> hey toddmparker 
[14:51:03] <agcolom> (maybe I missed you?)
[14:51:10] <arschmitz> Hey toddmparker sorry was pulled away for a while
[14:53:14] <toddmparker> hi agcolom and arschmitz 
[14:53:24] <toddmparker> np, that's my life
[14:53:40] <agcolom> How are you?
[14:53:54] <arschmitz> lol yeah I got pulled into spreadsheet hell :(
[14:55:17] <agcolom> I'm into tidying up examples in the api docs... and changing the template, which means changing the examples to fit with the new template... but had to be done, so glad I can do that now... 
[14:55:49] <arschmitz> cool on jqm iv been rewriting textinput widget
[14:56:45] <agcolom> should take me a few days... I'm stopping now for this evening as I'm starting to make mistakes... (and it's 11pm here ;-) )
[14:57:04] <agcolom> goodnight :-)
[14:57:12] <arschmitz> goodnight sleep well
[14:57:24] <agcolom> thanks :-) 
[14:58:34] <uGoMobi> Hi all
[14:59:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hey
[14:59:35] <uGoMobi> Het Alex
[14:59:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i gota say im jealous of your new iphone5 lol
[14:59:59] <uGoMobi> you were looping for me?
[15:00:08] <uGoMobi> haha
[15:00:14] <uGoMobi> nice
[15:00:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im still using a 4 as my actual every day phone
[15:00:25] <arschmitz> not even a 4s lol
[15:01:04] <uGoMobi> but it's not mine ;)
[15:01:31] <arschmitz> yeah doesnt stop me from being jealous ha ha ha
[15:01:47] <uGoMobi> You van play with it Unilever you send it ;)
[15:01:55] <arschmitz> lol
[15:02:10] <arschmitz> im going to get the new one as soon as it comes out anyway
[15:02:22] <arschmitz> just waiting iv been eligible for an upgrade for like a year
[15:03:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: anyway wanted to see what you thought about seperating out autogrow textarea and clearbutton as extensions to base textinput widget
[15:03:46] <arschmitz> seems like it would make sense to be able to exclude those 
[15:03:55] <uGoMobi> pfff autocorrection
[15:04:02] <uGoMobi> unilever lol
[15:04:15] <arschmitz> they make great personal hygiene products lol
[15:04:49] <uGoMobi> they do and it seems to be in dutch dictionary
[15:05:17] <uGoMobi> ok turned that off
[15:05:24] <uGoMobi> anyway textarea
[15:05:59] <arschmitz> lol
[15:06:05] <uGoMobi> what is the benefit?
[15:06:15] <arschmitz> ability to exclude it in a custom build
[15:06:29] <arschmitz> more granular modules
[15:06:47] <uGoMobi> but search always has clr btn
[15:07:01] <arschmitz> yeah
[15:07:10] <uGoMobi> so you would have to split out search then
[15:07:38] <arschmitz> yes an no if you dont include clearbutton you still get search style just without clear button
[15:08:16] <uGoMobi> hmm not sure about this
[15:08:38] <arschmitz> thinking is that textinputs base functionality is styling
[15:08:45] <arschmitz> and so it should do just that
[15:08:59] <arschmitz> any aditional functionality thats added should be a seperate extension
[15:09:31] <arschmitz> you could easily make a page without clearbuttons or autogrow textareas
[15:09:45] <arschmitz> but still want the textinput style 
[15:09:57] <arschmitz> espically since sliders depend on it
[15:10:20] <uGoMobi> it is an option, we are not planning splitting out all option code right?
[15:10:34] <arschmitz> no
[15:11:07] <arschmitz> but this is more then just an option
[15:11:31] <arschmitz> it addes a whole new set of functionality that is not nessasarrily needed for core functionality
[15:11:42] <uGoMobi> same with autogrow... it's a feature that is part of the widget and not optional
[15:12:10] <arschmitz> right but what if you dont want or need autogrow?
[15:12:26] <uGoMobi> i get your point, it's just about what is core functionality and what not
[15:12:31] <arschmitz> there is not even a way to turn it off right now let alone exclude the unneeded code
[15:14:07] <uGoMobi> yeah that's true 
[15:14:38] <uGoMobi> making it an option probably affects startup perf
[15:14:38] <arschmitz> this would not really effect the normal build
[15:14:51] <arschmitz> it would mostly be for custom builds
[15:15:09] <uGoMobi> right
[15:15:17] <arschmitz> and it would add an option for autogrow instead of making it always happen
[15:15:56] <arschmitz> but it would default to true
[15:16:05] <arschmitz> for backcompat
[15:16:15] <arschmitz> and just because its a good idea (autogrow)
[15:18:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: anything you can exclude in the custom build will improve startup time there is less to download and run
[15:18:32] <uGoMobi> at some point we said we didn't want to add options to widgets if not really needed
[15:18:41] <arschmitz> absolutely
[15:19:26] <arschmitz> autogrow i think though is something people should be able to turn off what if you just want a fixed height textinput. right now its not possible without data-role="none" and then you lose the style
[15:19:46] <arschmitz> we are making it impossible to emulate native functionality
[15:20:21] <uGoMobi> sorry dc 
[15:20:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem
[15:20:45] <uGoMobi> ok good point
[15:21:14] <arschmitz> generally im against addint options but this i think is a very valid execption
[15:21:18] <uGoMobi> okay so we add option autogrow with default true
[15:21:24] <arschmitz> yes
[15:21:28] <uGoMobi> then clear btn
[15:21:39] <arschmitz> clearbutton nothing will change functionally
[15:21:51] <arschmitz> it just allows you to exclude it in a custom build
[15:22:17] <uGoMobi> right but i am still thinking about the search input
[15:22:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we would just have to note in the module in the download builder this is all clearbuttons including search
[15:22:51] <arschmitz> if they exclude
[15:24:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: anyway i gotta run think about it and im going to do a pr with the changes because i also want scott to look at it
[15:24:41] <arschmitz> as form widgets are something they want to pull from mobile so since this turned into a full rewrite i figured good time to have him look
[15:24:58] <uGoMobi> i don't have the code in front of me
[15:25:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: code for what?
[15:28:02] <uGoMobi> hmm my next line is missing.... anyway, wanted to check what class we add for styling and if it could break anything
[15:28:18] <uGoMobi> textinput widget code
[15:29:03] <uGoMobi> i'll give it a look when i am on my laptop
[15:55:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool and in reality its very easy to move the functionality around because its all seperate methods now so if we wanted to move all search stuff into clearbutton or move clear button back into textinput its basicly a copy and paste
