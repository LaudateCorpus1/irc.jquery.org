[03:26:25] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, gd morning
[03:27:45] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, currently, download builder loads `/resources/download.js` or `resources/themeroller.js` at the bottom of its "body" content within a script tag
[03:28:53] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, but, by that time jQuery has not been loaded yet. Because, http://dev.jqueryui.com/download/ loads it at the bottom of body.
[03:33:16] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, One possible fix is deferring resources/[themeroller/download].js with <script defer ...>. It worked here for firefox. But, I dont know the cross browser compatibility of this attribute
[03:43:42] <rxaviers> Im adding defer for now

[04:57:13] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Im referring to https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com
[04:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'm referring to your comment about <script defer>
[04:57:48] <rxaviers> ah pardom let me check
[04:58:04] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, mm
[04:58:21] <rxaviers> thank you!
[04:58:32] <rxaviers> i will revert that on download builder then
[04:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> re: jqueryui.com, I assume that Richard meant deploy not build, so yes.

[05:09:39] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ah! ok to update it directly on master? since it's a minor fix?
[05:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Go ahead. You might also want to change the header to Deploy instead of Build.
[05:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, do it in master.

[06:46:09] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, little help. Frontend download builder and themeroller fetches data from server using $.ajax. On production, we have different domain names. I need to change the requests to use jsonp right?
[06:46:43] <sh0ne> is there any way to make jQuery UI datepicker hidden initially if it is attached to a span field (not input) ?
[06:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: yes
[06:51:31] <scott_gonzalez> sh0ne: Please ask in #jquery.
[06:52:11] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, thks

[08:55:29] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, FYI there are several fix commits above. Unless it is no problem having that much messy commits, my plan is to clean it up before lending it into master by creating another "cleaner themeroller branch".
[08:56:07] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You can do whatever you want on a branch that is not a main dev branch.
[08:56:27] <rxaviers> ok
[08:56:28] <scott_gonzalez> Since themeroller is only used by you and jzaefferer, it's fine to change history there.
[08:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> But for example, something like jquery-ui's interactions branch can't have history changed because it's a long living branch that people follow.
[08:57:26] <rxaviers> alright
[09:41:58] * rxaviers leaving for lunch
[10:03:30] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: hm.. the side bar on stage.jqueryui.com has a nasty overflow
[10:03:36] <Krinkle> http://stage.jqueryui.com/
[10:03:41] <Krinkle> all over button are in overflow
[10:03:51] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: It's a bug in all sites.
[10:03:56] <Krinkle> k
[10:04:01] <Krinkle> reported?
[10:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[10:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> Blame kswedberg :-)
[10:05:09] <Krinkle> btw, why don't we have a http://stage.jquery.com/ yet? (I know it exists, but it shows the same thing as the live one)
[10:05:18] <Krinkle> is there work on that being done?
[10:05:42] <Krinkle> its seems to be the last site still on the jQuery Rocker theme
[10:06:01] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: oh the humiliation!
[10:06:10] <kswedberg> ok, I'll try to fix tonight.
[10:06:57] <Krinkle> btw, there's also an issue with the footer not connecting to the bottom of short pages
[10:06:58] <kswedberg> Krinkle: stage.jquery.com might have been deployed from the legacy branch?
[10:07:01] <Krinkle> e.g. http://stage.jquery.org/
[10:07:11] <Krinkle> purple on the bottom
[10:07:17] <Krinkle> btw, is purple going to be the foundation color?
[10:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: We haven't started the new jquery.com.
[10:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> The live site is runnig off of the repo, which is why stage.jquery.com is showing that.
[10:08:01] <Krinkle> I liked the kinda toned down "official" look we have on jquery.com (dark green, shades of colors of old paper)
[10:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: There's no more legacy branch :-)
[10:08:05] <Krinkle> aha
[10:08:28] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Do you mean .org?
[10:08:33] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.com has never been green.
[10:08:37] <Krinkle> yes
[10:09:02] <kswedberg> yeah, I'm not a fan of the pink jquery.org
[10:09:05] <kswedberg> oh well.
[10:09:18] <scott_gonzalez> Neither am I.
[10:09:32] <kswedberg> whose choice was that?
[10:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> No idea.
[10:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> I assume the change was to avoid being too close to stage.jquerymobile.com.
[10:12:36] <kswedberg> yeah. probably
[10:13:40] <kswedberg> hmm. also this http://api.qunitjs.com/
[10:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> oh yeah
[11:13:34] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: what do you think of this color scheme for jquery.org instead of the pink? http://swedberg.us/i/jQuery_Foundation-20120919-141243.jpg
[11:13:44] <kswedberg> keep in mind, it's just a first pass
[11:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> I like that a lot better.
[11:14:11] * rxaviers liked ^
[11:15:23] <kswedberg> cool. do you think I'll be stepping on toes / pissing people off if I commit that? maybe I should push to a fork instead and send a pull request? after polishing it up a bit, of course.
[11:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> I would just push.
[11:15:52] <kswedberg> ok. :)
[11:30:35] <DaveMethvin> push it kswedberg!
[11:31:03] <kswedberg> ok. will do. gonna make a few more tweaks first
[11:31:05] <ryanneufeld> kswedberg: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4onJ7Z2MLI
[11:31:30] <kswedberg> ryanneufeld: thanks, I needed that. :)
[11:31:47] <ryanneufeld> kswedberg: np, glad you enjoyed it
[12:25:39] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, does the below also makes sense to you?

[12:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yes, I really don't like those classes being shown off, but that's a good change.
[12:28:58] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, PR or commit?
[12:29:03] <scott_gonzalez> commit
[12:29:08] <rxaviers> k
[12:30:12] <scott_gonzalez> I kind of want to just delete that page :-P
[12:30:25] <rxaviers> hehe
