[07:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg kborchers jzaefferer: Can I use XPath to say "all child signature nodes or this node if there are no signature nodes"?
[07:41:36] <scott_gonzalez> I originally tried "signature | ." but that's just a union.
[07:41:52] <scott_gonzalez> Is there an XPath equivalent of :not()?
[07:42:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: is this for an apply-templates or something?
[07:43:04] <scott_gonzalez> I want to put it in a for-each.
[07:43:22] <scott_gonzalez> If the method has signatures, loop through them, otherwise just use the current node.
[07:44:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: maybe something like this? https://gist.github.com/3416176
[07:45:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm trying to avoid having them separated.
[07:45:29] <kborchers> :P
[07:47:26] <scott_gonzalez> Got it :-)
[07:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> signature | self::node()[count(signature) = 0]
[07:47:51] <kborchers> fun
[07:50:54] <kborchers> that's actually really cool. i didn't know you could do that. i was thinking you would have to union, then basically do that test inside the loop checking the current index if > 0 and last then don't process because it is the current node after signature nodes

[07:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, time for Touch Events meeting.
[08:03:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can you deploy your version to stage?
[08:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[08:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> deployed
[08:10:49] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what happened to the ToC? Looking at http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[08:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> I removed it. It's going to be reimplemented in a different way.
[08:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> It was way too big to be the first thing on the page.
[08:11:39] <jzaefferer> okay

[12:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can you send me Ryan's email address?
[12:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Lots of updates to the XSL just landed for Mobile.
[12:42:27] <scott_gonzalez> Big things that you'll probably notice: The TOC is gone and the longdesc is after the options/methods/events.
[12:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> We still need to do a lot of styling work, but the transforms should be pretty solid now.
[12:43:21] <scott_gonzalez> We now have UI, Mobile, and core all running on the same code.
[12:43:33] <scott_gonzalez> Still separate copies though.
[14:27:22] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ping
[17:44:27] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: still around?
[17:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[17:45:29] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember why I pinged you though.
[17:45:32] <kborchers> just saw your ping from earlier
[17:45:36] <kborchers> :)
[17:46:03] <kborchers> i'll just assume it was to tell me i'm awesome :P
[17:55:22] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: perhaps :-P
