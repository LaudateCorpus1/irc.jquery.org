[11:17:22] <gnarf> jonathansampson: you around? ajpiano?
[12:19:06] <gnarf> So, I'm playin around with xml docs... there seems to be some issues with this build script :)
[12:36:45] <gnarf> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-docs/commits/gnarf
[12:37:00] <jonathansampson> I'm around. Sorry.
[12:37:23] <jonathansampson> Just sat down. What did I miss?
[12:37:48] <gnarf> nothin really, was just gonna see if ajpiano / anyone else was also around to give some insight on docs
[12:37:53] <gnarf> jzaefferer: ?
[12:42:16] <jonathansampson> What build script are you using?
[13:00:07] <ThiefMaster> umm.. how is .datepicker('dialog') supposed to work?
[13:00:21] <ThiefMaster> _dialogDatepicker is not used anywhere in the code
[13:05:10] <gnarf> jonathansampson: ant
[13:05:13] <gnarf> jonathansampson: build.xml
[13:06:33] <gnarf> this is my first time working with xslt
[13:06:37] <gnarf> it seems kinda awesome
[13:11:30] <gnarf> ThiefMaster: i have no clue
[13:11:49] <jonathansampson> More experience than I have. I am impressed with what I've seen so far though.
