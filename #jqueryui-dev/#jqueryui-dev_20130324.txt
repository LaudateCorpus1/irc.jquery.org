[20:33:11] <kborchers_> scott_gonzalez: ^^^
[20:34:51] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: also i have the pointer special event (under external in ui) living here right now but can move somewhere else if you want https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-pointer
[20:37:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: also, the pointer stuff could probably be better i.e. only copying the props we need from the original event instead of all of them but this seems to work for now. just wanted to get you something to look at, tear apart and let me know what i did wrong and need to change :)
