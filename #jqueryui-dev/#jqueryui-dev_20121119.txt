[05:40:31] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin mikesherov: Is there anywhere in core that expects a number, but accepts a string that is just a number?
[05:40:52] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: oh man
[05:41:10] <mikesherov> I think all of dimensions do
[05:41:12] <scott_gonzalez> Everything that's coming to mind accepts numbers as pixels and strings with units.
[05:41:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ah ok. i thought that was the case but couldn't remember when we drop ie6. thanks
[05:41:36] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: IE6 is being dropped with 1.10.0.
[05:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> It's interesting that it crashes though.
[05:42:01] <scott_gonzalez> But the minwidth code did change (I ripped out the support test for CSS min-width.
[05:42:32] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: dimensions can accept a string
[05:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Is there a place that accepts a string, but only as pixels?
[05:43:01] <mikesherov> .css() setter does as well
[05:43:16] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yes, in .css
[05:43:34] <mikesherov> actually, no
[05:43:39] <mikesherov> let me read this thing
[05:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'm kind of shocked that .outerWidth( "30em" ) works.
[05:44:25] <mikesherov> O_o
[05:44:49] <mikesherov> 30em can't work how you expect though
[05:46:12] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: unless border and margin and padding all get reported out in em units, which I was fairly certain isn't the case cross browser
[05:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's doing something that seems sane, wheter it's pixel correct, I'm not sure.
[05:49:06] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: sure, it's probably doing SOMETHING
[05:49:09] <mikesherov> :-P
[05:49:37] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I'm looking to land the following, can I just get a quick yay or nay from you?
[05:49:50] <mikesherov> I'll squash these myself: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/830
[05:50:09] <mikesherov> and: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/826
[05:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Why did we decide not to add appendTo? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7948
[05:55:32] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I thought this already landed?
[05:55:42] <scott_gonzalez> The resizable one.
[05:56:24] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: this is for draggable
[05:56:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, so this PR just contains too much?
[05:56:57] <mikesherov> yeah, he screwed up, I'm going to fix it for him
[05:56:58] <scott_gonzalez> It has stuff that was already merged?
[05:56:59] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:57:16] <mikesherov> he had real trouble rebasing, so I'm just going to take it home for him with notes
[05:57:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that looks good.
[05:58:47] <scott_gonzalez> Datepicker looks good, though $(document).find("body") is odd.
[05:59:02] <mikesherov> yeah, it is odd
[05:59:05] <scott_gonzalez> I realize the previous code was also odd.
[05:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> But we should just change that to $( document.body )
[05:59:31] <mikesherov> sure, I can do that.
[05:59:57] <mikesherov> I mean, even just $('body') will shortcut to that

[06:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> heh, so far it's been very helpful.
[06:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> I watch all commits in master, though sometimes there's a big delay.
[06:18:02] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: how come htmllint didn't complain?
[06:18:11] <mikesherov> Are we htmllinting the test suite?
[06:18:43] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think htmllint catches it.
[06:19:05] <scott_gonzalez> There's not really a set of options like jshint.
[06:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's basically a validation test.

[07:40:59] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers toddmparker: Yes, but does jzaefferer still plan on having menubar in 1.10?
[07:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> He didn't assign it to anyone and he took over dialog.
[07:43:12] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: o_O â€¦ i asked that question before my talk in asia and i understood the response as if it's on the roadmap, it's in. if that is not the case, we should update the roadmap. What happened to Rafael doing it?
[07:43:39] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I don't know. It's entirely possible that he plans on it getting in to 1.10.
[07:44:06] <scott_gonzalez> But we're getting close to the beta and nothing new has been reviewed yet.
[07:44:51] <kborchers> yeah, i had that same thought when i told toddmparker those dates but i figured jzaefferer had some magic trick up his sleeve that i didn't know about since it was still on the roadmap :)
[07:45:23] <toddmparker> ah, that's why i handed off the adobe guy to scott_gonzalez

[08:35:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: have you ever done anything with the hooks api?
[08:35:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the github support guys are suggesting I try deleting the service hooks on the old repos via the API then add them again to get them to listen to the new events / add colors / what not
[10:38:45] <mikesherov> I still can't believe we're closing in on 400 for UI! 430 active tickets
[10:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I know, it's awesome. :-)
[10:47:47] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: which hook?
[10:58:26] <rworth> you guys rock
[11:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> It is so frustrating how many people use <base> and don't understand how it works.
[11:10:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the IRC hooks on jquery / jquery-ui / jquerymobile --- need to add the issue/pull request notification to em
[11:10:19] <gnarf> that or he suggested deleting then re-adding via the admin
[11:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, those. I haven't done any work with the IRC hooks.
[11:13:16] <gnarf> apparently the API is the same
[11:39:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you used the API for the other hooks right?
[11:39:50] <gnarf> can you try issuing a delete for the IRC hook on jquery-ui ?
[11:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I've used the API for a few things.
[11:39:58] <gnarf> or
[11:40:05] <gnarf> see if you can just subscribe it to pulls ?
[11:40:22] <gnarf> or is this something easy to do that I'm just failing at figuring out? :)
[11:40:35] <gnarf> got a code sample of Hooks API I can start from?
[11:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is there a reason not to just do this from their UI?
[11:43:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the UI doesn't allow you to do either of these things
[11:43:58] <gnarf> you can disable the hook, but it doesn't actually delete it
[11:44:29] <gnarf> plus when you setup the hook it only adds notifications the first time - so since the first version of the IRC service hook, they have added support for Pulls and Issues
[11:44:37] <gnarf> but we aren't subscribed to those events
[11:44:39] <gnarf> so we don't see them
[11:44:58] <gnarf> there is no way to re-subscribe in the UI - you have to use the API (according to support)
[11:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> That's pretty ghetto.
[11:45:21] <gnarf> agree
[11:45:26] <scott_gonzalez> Let me dig through the API docs to see what we need to do.
[11:46:04] <gnarf> from what I've seen on http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/ - we need to add "issues" and "pull_request"
[11:46:11] <gnarf> http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/#edit-a-hook
[11:46:24] <gnarf> my biggest github api problems are always auth
[11:47:50] <gnarf> the IRC notifier can listen to "push" "issues" and "pull_request" now, but the old one only asked for "push" https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/services/irc.rb#L7-L31
[11:48:21] <redengin> does anyone know of a swipe event addon for jqueryui?
[11:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm getting a 404 for /repos/jquery/jquery-ui/hooks :-/
[11:58:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sigh
[11:58:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thats about where I got too
[11:58:27] <gnarf> i figured my auth was bad
[12:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I gotta go sign some papers, but I can try to look into this more when I get back.
[12:03:04] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like this is just busted though.
[12:04:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah - gist me up a write up with whatever you give up with so I can CC it to github and beg for them to fix it without us having to waste more hours on this seemingly trivial thing
[13:03:51] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! Can we produce this with the current XSLT (or should I leave it by hand?) $( ".selector" ).attr( "checked", true ).checkboxradio( "refresh" );
[13:04:44] <agcolom> (see http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/checkboxradio/#method-refresh )
[13:05:28] <agcolom> here's the original one: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/radiobuttons/methods.html
[13:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: No, you can't do that with the auto-generated examples.
[13:18:13] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, can I avoid having auto generated code for one specific method?
[13:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> We need a Trac plugin that detects the words "tabs" and "base" and throws up a screen that says, "I realize you think there's a bug, but please please PLEASE learn what the fuck you're doing." and then rejects the ticket.
[13:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Not currently.
[13:20:10] * kborchers starts writing the plugin and also includes detection for 'jaqueries' and 'you broke my site you bitch'
[13:20:18] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:21:04] <agcolom> ok. could we add that? (maybe if we have something like 'nocode' attribute? 
[13:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> We can add a suppress-example attribute to the method.
[13:26:02] <agcolom> that'd be really nice :-)
[13:26:23] <agcolom> (and that would REALLY help me with that particular example!)
[13:26:24] <scott_gonzalez> Which would align nicely with <methods suppress-examples="true">
[13:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can add something to just have a custom example.
[13:27:00] <agcolom> perfect!
[13:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> Which would probably be better.
[13:27:07] <agcolom> yes
[13:27:13] <scott_gonzalez> To avoid having to duplicate the markup for adding the header.
[13:27:53] <agcolom> ok, 
[13:28:29] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Would you still want to standard description of "Invoke the refresh method:" ?
[13:28:37] <scott_gonzalez> s/to/the/
[13:29:01] <agcolom> Whatever is the easiest for you really
[13:29:06] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:29:33] <agcolom> I only have 2 methods so far that would fall into that category
[13:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Upgrade to 0.5.15
[13:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> You can add <example>$( ".selector" ).attr( "checked", true ).checkboxradio( "refresh" );</example> inside the <method>
[13:49:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: So my script is definitely correct, but the hooks API is busted.
[13:49:49] <scott_gonzalez> If I changes /hooks to /collaborators, it works fine.
[13:50:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: gist it? I'm just going to email them with mine, yours, and a <beg> section
[13:51:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you sure its not an auth thing?
[13:52:01] <gnarf> like can you get something else requiring privilege?
[13:52:05] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? This is suddenly working.
[13:52:11] <gnarf> like jquery/infrastructure/collab
[13:52:21] <gnarf> voodoo
[13:52:22] <gnarf> quick!
[13:52:42] <gnarf> you have 5 minutes when the hooks api works 
[13:52:43] <gnarf> go!
[13:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[14:01:08] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: fantastic! Thank you so much!
[14:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Ok, let's see if that worked.
[14:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> What should it notify us about? Just new PRs or comments/closes?
[14:02:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: open/close of prs
[14:02:41] <gnarf> so file a pull
[14:02:41] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[14:03:03] <gnarf> comments don't notify - if we wanted to add it to the bot we could
[14:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> Just closed a PR
[14:03:25] * gnarf sighs
[14:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> ...and re-opened
[14:03:44] <gnarf> lemme test it on learn
[14:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> The API says it's on.
[14:04:36] <gnarf> i know it notifies about new pulls
[14:04:49] <gnarf> i've seen it do that
[14:05:49] * gnarf sighs
[14:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll file a new PR.

[14:11:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the IRC post-receive could already handle it tho - we can just ask github to pull it in
[14:11:29] <scott_gonzalez> I assume all the repos already have the hook setup, they just need to be updated, right?
[14:11:38] <scott_gonzalez> I don't need to write logic to see if it exists and if not add it?
[14:11:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: if it doesn't have it, we don't want it/need it at the moment
[14:11:58] <gnarf> i went and added it to everything i could think we wanted it on
[14:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, actually I don't need the map. When I get the list of existing hooks, it'll have the channel info.
[14:12:18] <gnarf> yeah
[14:12:24] <gnarf> keep the config from the old hook
[14:12:26] <gnarf> just update events
[14:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> Right, it's annoying that I have to specify the name and config to update the events.
[14:12:42] <scott_gonzalez> IT ALREADY KNOWS
[14:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> I hate their API so much.
[14:13:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, no message on closing the PR.
[14:13:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i bet you i could convince mikesherov to write some ruby to add http://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#gollumevent to https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/services/irc.rb#L7
[14:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> Because that PR auto-closed on a merge and we didn't get notified.
[14:14:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: maybe its just issue closing then
[14:14:32] <gnarf> and since we aren't using issues, we don't get close
[14:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> The docs say "pull_request - Any time a Pull Request is opened, closed, or synchronized (updated due to a new push in the branch that the pull request is tracking)."
[14:15:03] <scott_gonzalez> LIES
[14:15:16] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: so do I use the the example as a new node under the method? and do I use suppress-example="true" as an attribute to the method?
[14:15:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: maybe its https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/services/irc.rb#L22 stopping it
[14:15:41] <gnarf> and the campfire hook doesn't do that
[14:15:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yes: new node under method. No: don't add suppress-example.
[14:16:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i haven't actually seen an "issue closing" notification out of the irc bot yet
[14:16:32] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe that's supposed to be something like "return unless open?" to prevent notifications for closed PRs?
[14:16:35] <gnarf> just the campfire bot on my other repo
[14:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, I have no idea what the ruby API looks like, so I'm just making up property names :-P
[14:17:20] <gnarf> yeah the campfire does this: https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/services/campfire.rb#L28-L31
[14:18:58] * gnarf curses himself for not learning ruby yet
[14:20:55] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: all working perfectly! Thank you!!!!!
[14:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You're welcome :-)
[14:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do we have a list of repos with IRC hooks?
[14:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> Or should I use the API to get that too?
[14:22:39] <gnarf> no current list exists, i was just figuring you'd iterate all of the repos
[14:22:44] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #816: SUCCESS in 11 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/816/
[14:22:45] <doesallmagic> Scott GonzÃ¡lez: Autocomplete: Whitespace.
[14:22:55] <scott_gonzalez> YAY, more API calls.
[14:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> I should just write a module for working with GitHub...
[14:23:19] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like that probably exists.
[14:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, got the list of repos.
[14:33:36] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Everything should be updated.
[14:35:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: For future use: https://gist.github.com/4114537
[14:35:43] <scott_gonzalez> Just enter your username/password at the top and run the script. It'll update all repos.
[14:36:26] <gnarf> nice
[14:36:36] <gnarf> i think gf3 might add gollum to irc bot for us 
[14:36:42] <gnarf> which like totally closes an issue
[14:36:55] <gnarf> of course, email is another story
[14:36:57] <gnarf> but irc will be nice
[14:37:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[14:55:17] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez kborchers toddmparker: just updated the roadmap along with a comment: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap#comment1353365683
[15:08:58] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can you review the main dialog PR, check the last few commits once more? I'd like to land that in master soon. Will close/fix three tickets. I've looked through the remaining dialog tickets, it didn't look like anything else is addressed.
[15:17:17] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - git core build #220: SUCCESS in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/220/
[15:30:13] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI 1-9-stable - git core build #8: SUCCESS in 12 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%20git%20core/8/
[15:31:21] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: can you loo into getting TestSwarm to provide more output for these errors, beyond the "Invalid arguments" message? http://swarm.jquery.org/result/487275
[15:31:45] <Krinkle> TestSwarm doesn't provide anything. This is just aggregated from QUnit.
[15:32:00] <Krinkle> Oh, that one
[15:32:12] <Krinkle> Nope, afaik that's all it can get
[15:32:17] <Krinkle> It is a global uncaught exception
[15:32:46] <jzaefferer> no file/line arguments?
[15:33:30] <jzaefferer> where is that error handler?
[15:33:33] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: window.onerror
[15:33:37] <Krinkle> that's a tough one
[15:33:41] <Krinkle> inject.js
[15:33:55] <jzaefferer> ah, inject.js
[15:34:17] <Krinkle> I'd rather not bring in a big library that does all this cross-browser attempting of triggering a stack trace
[15:34:19] <jzaefferer> why isn't it using the filePath and linerNr arguments?
[15:34:32] <Krinkle> which afaik doesn't even work from window.onerror because the trace is gone (from my experience)
[15:34:34] <jzaefferer> just stick it to the message
[15:34:50] <jzaefferer> there's no trace in onerror, just filename and linenumber
[15:34:54] <Krinkle> since QUnit has this logic, maybe QUnit can attach to window.onerror instead and display it in the page instead.
[15:35:09] <Krinkle> (by triggering new Error() from there and getting a trace)
[15:35:17] <Krinkle> though I"m not sure that works from window.onerror
[15:35:25] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Good point about the arguments, not sure why I didn't
[15:35:39] <jzaefferer> That's the only somewhat reliable part here
[15:35:55] <jzaefferer> IE<10 doesn't have stacktraces
[15:36:25] <jzaefferer> Can you add those and rerun http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/ ?
[15:36:42] <Krinkle> Sure
[15:36:48] <jzaefferer> thanks
[15:36:56] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, I'm currently on branch projects-3 locally.
[15:37:06] <Krinkle> third (and last) attempt on that big refactoring
[15:37:08] <jzaefferer> gnarf and scott_gonzalez might appreciate that, if it actually tells us more then it does now
[15:37:19] <Krinkle> it'll fix about 10 different bugs, 5 of which are blocking 1.0
[15:37:26] <jzaefferer> projects-3?
[15:37:36] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[15:37:37] <Krinkle> "user/client > projects relationship " stuff
[15:37:38] <jzaefferer> nice
[15:37:47] <Krinkle> pretty major
[15:37:58] <Krinkle> anyway, I'll git co -b hotfix -t master :)
[15:38:09] <jzaefferer> :-)
[15:40:48] <jzaefferer> I'll get some sleep, maybe
[16:35:13] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15selfthinker opened pull request #834: CSS: Reformatted CSS to use better coding standard (06master...06master)  02http://git.io/uxDVoA
[16:42:51] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[16:43:00] <mikesherov> did you see this css reformatting PR?
[16:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> Not yet, but I think it might be the next thing in my inbox.
[16:44:54] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: where should I get the content for a contributing.md file from?
[16:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> probably a mixture of core's guide + http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/25941597/Commit%20Message%20Style%20Guide
[16:45:41] <_zoggy_> whats with teh comments in that pull
[16:45:42] <_zoggy_> +  -webkit-border-top-left-radius: 4px/*{cornerRadius}*/;
[16:45:52] <_zoggy_> +  color: #cd0a0a/*{fcError}*/;
[16:46:15] <_zoggy_> +  margin: -8px/*{offsetTopShadow}*/ 0 0 -8px/*{offsetLeftShadow}*/;
[16:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: That's how TR works.
[16:46:28] <_zoggy_> it pulls them out to use as variables/
[16:46:37] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[16:46:41] <_zoggy_> gotcha
[16:47:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's nice that you picked those specific rules though.
[16:47:36] <scott_gonzalez> We should drop border radius prefixing.
[16:47:57] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: what about iOS5?
[16:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> You mean iOS3.2?
[16:48:17] <mikesherov> doesn't that still need prefixing for old mobile? I could be mistaken.
[16:48:21] <scott_gonzalez> http://caniuse.com/#search=border-radius
[16:48:27] <mikesherov> ugh
[16:49:01] <mikesherov> ok, I'm dumb
[16:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[16:49:25] <scott_gonzalez> border-radius is like the one thing that doesn't require prefixing anywhere.
[16:49:27] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I think we should either land that pull immediately, or resolve never to change :-P
[16:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> I want to land it.
[16:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> I've actually done this myself.
[16:49:47] <scott_gonzalez> But I was nervous with old TR.
[16:49:49] <mikesherov> so then do it
[16:49:53] <mikesherov> Oh
[16:50:01] <mikesherov> I'm the devil on your shoulder
[16:51:34] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[16:51:49] <scott_gonzalez> I just want to run it through TR first and make sure everything is good.
[16:54:06] <mikesherov> sorry, I disconnected for a moment
[16:54:19] <mikesherov> new themeroller can handle this?
[16:55:02] <mikesherov> kborchers: you there?
[16:55:19] <scott_gonzalez> Old ThemeRoller should've been able to handle it too, but there was no way to test it.
[16:55:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on getting his branch into download builder right now for testing.
[16:55:57] <mikesherov> cool
[16:56:06] <mikesherov> excited to have that land
[16:56:16] <scott_gonzalez> Me too. It's bothered me for years.
[17:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...this isn't working the way I expected. I may need to wait until Rafael is around if I can't get TR to serve up this branch.
[17:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> It's strange because I can see that it's properly using the updated code in the /release directory.
[17:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, heh, it's running against production.
[17:12:49] <scott_gonzalez> ah, much better
[17:26:03] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: So there's only one minor issue.
[17:26:13] <scott_gonzalez> Should I just fix it and land it now or wait for him to fix it?
[17:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> He'll probably fix quickly.
[17:26:54] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: just fix it
[17:26:59] <mikesherov> and it's a her :-)
[17:27:16] <scott_gonzalez> Indeed, just saw that when I was looking for a name.
[17:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I'm going to ask her to sign the CLA, so I'll wait.
[17:28:22] <mikesherov> sounds good
[17:37:47] <scott_gonzalez> Gah, one more day to get everything packed into boxes and loaded into the truck :-/
[17:37:53] <scott_gonzalez> SO MUCH STUFF
[17:39:00] <petersendidit> Trash bags and duck tape ;-)
[17:41:17] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: moving to PA, right?
[17:41:24] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[17:50:00] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, time to do some more packing. Later.
[17:52:40] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: good luck!
[17:54:01] <kborchers> mikesherov: i'm here now. need anything specific?
[17:54:12] <kborchers> jzaefferer: thanks for that update on the roadmap
[17:54:17] <mikesherov> oh, yeah, let me remember
[17:54:49] <mikesherov> I had a comment on: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/738
[17:55:13] <mikesherov> and other than that comment, I think progressbar indeterminate is good to goâ€¦ what's the blocker to merging?
[17:55:29] <mikesherov> I'm just trying to get the PR queue under 25 so we're back to one page, LOL
[17:56:52] <mikesherov> kborchers: ^
[17:57:17] <kborchers> mikesherov: doh â€¦ i think it got moved and then lost when i had a mess merging master back in. i'll fix that shortly. thanks for that final review. i figured i missed something :)
[17:57:41] <mikesherov> kborchers, maybe it'll still be in your reflog!
[17:57:48] <mikesherov> fingers crossed :-)

[18:20:43] <mikesherov> kborchers: so an indeterminate progressbar fires complete immediately?
[18:21:30] <kborchers> mikesherov: no
[18:21:41] <kborchers> the percentage is set to 100 but the value is still false
[18:22:00] <mikesherov> I see, which is why you made that change to .options.value instead of .value()
[18:22:25] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I'm going to land this!
[18:22:26] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/834
[18:23:03] <kborchers> no that was just to use the value that was already there â€¦ value() just returns .options.value anyway
[18:23:36] <mikesherov> OK
