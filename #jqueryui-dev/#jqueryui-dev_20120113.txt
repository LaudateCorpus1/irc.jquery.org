[07:58:49] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #798 on coffee-script, reported by mnasyrov (1y, 2m ago): Coffee doesn't compile files in UTF-8 with signature
[08:00:38] <scott_gonzalez> http://stackoverflow.com/a/3622153/143007
[08:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> That sed script looks like a good solution.
[08:04:04] <gnarf> perl -se 's/^\xEF\xBB\xBF//s'
[08:04:10] <gnarf> perl -pe 's/^\xEF\xBB\xBF//s'
[08:04:14] <gnarf> typoed the first time
[08:04:28] <gnarf> makes "whitespace" perl -pe 's/^\xEF\xBB\xBF//s;s/\s+$/\n/g'
[08:05:05] <gnarf> is there any way to have git status return an exit code if the tree is dirty?
[08:05:24] <gnarf> i want to make the "make whitespace" fail if it actually modified anything
[08:05:36] <gnarf> or just thinking about it
[08:05:56] <gnarf> cuz then we could put that in the standard build chain, and be like "you need to commit the whitespace fixes before moving on"
[08:06:20] <gnarf> but then you can't build uncommited, nvm
[08:13:44] <kborchers> .seen gyzmodo
[08:13:52] <kborchers> :(
[08:14:06] <kborchers> "so how can i get .box1's height?"
[08:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[08:14:54] <gnarf> no hs_bot in ui-dev huh
[08:15:01] <scott_gonzalez> alert( $( "*" ).eq( 1 ).box().height() );
[08:15:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that's overkill. .box() does all magic you just say $("*").box(); and it knows you wanted the height and it alerts it for you silly
[08:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> oh, right, of course :-)

[08:20:51] <gnarf> hey scott_gonzalez
[08:20:57] <gnarf> this nave thing
[08:21:12] <gnarf> it seems to be messing up my PS1
[08:23:09] <gnarf> it isn't running my .bash_profile
[08:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> run nave usemain 0.6.7
[08:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> Then you won't need to launch a new shell and you should get your .bash_profile back
[08:32:09] <gnarf> nice
[08:32:25] <gnarf> i also finally setup uglifyjs as a command

[11:05:17] <clarkbox> scptt_gonzalez, jzaefferer i have a primitive browserstack script ready
[11:05:54] <clarkbox> there is an issue on their end with ie6 and opera11.1, but i think they have it fixed already
[11:08:48] <clarkbox> also, i need someone to write some more elaborate sql than this:
[11:08:49] <clarkbox> select distinct useragent_id from run_useragent where runs=0 and status=0;
[11:09:31] <clarkbox> ^that is used to grab the list of browsers to be spawned
[11:09:57] <clarkbox> but i need to also restrict useragents that are currently running
[11:11:21] <clarkbox> i can bang away at it, but if someone around knows about testswarm a little, it can get done faster.

[11:47:02] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/selectmenu] Selectmenu: improved dropdown CSS style unit test - Felix Nagel
[12:04:41] <gnarf> clarkbox: tbh - you should run one of each browser, unless you're already running one
[12:05:15] <gnarf> don't trust a random client, only ones you've spawned
[12:26:54] <clarkbox> oh ok. in that case ill have to keep some state.
[12:30:07] <gnarf> clarkbox: yeah, i would rather that browserstack swarm kept track of its own clients rather than relying on testswarm
[12:30:31] <gnarf> remember: if the browser loses focus, its not a "good" client for swarm anymore
[12:32:37] <gnarf> I have someone in #jquery complaining about http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7359 - not sure i care enough to add it to 1.8.18's desires
[12:37:39] <clarkbox> sounds good. i did not know there was such low trust with anonymous clients. i will just need to keep a log/db of worker IDs returned from browserstack api requests. when the script runs, ill query the status of each, and start a new worker if required. is one worker per browser enough?
[12:38:01] <gnarf> clarkbox: probably
[12:38:26] <gnarf> clarkbox: random clients on the net fail all the time because of "focus"
[12:38:37] <gnarf> thats one of the reasons we wanted this browserstack thing
[12:39:45] <clarkbox> any recommendations for a flat file key/val store for node?
[12:39:55] <clarkbox> i just came across this: http://thechangelog.com/post/807837625/nstore-easy-database-written-for-node-js-in-node-js
[12:39:58] <gnarf> clarkbox: json ?
[12:40:37] <clarkbox> ya... i guess that will do
[12:40:48] <gnarf> clarkbox: i have some code to read/write json files in sizer.js on the jquery build
[12:40:58] <clarkbox> k ill check it out
[12:52:10] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, reading a json file in node is just require() :-P
[12:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> writing is fs.writeFile( "browsers.json", JSON.stringify( browsers ), callback );
[12:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> you can even fs.writeFileSync(), we don't really care about blocking for TestSwarm.
[12:54:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: That draggable bug sounds like native drag on images.
[12:54:17] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't bother looking at it
[13:02:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, thats basically what i told the guy that had the problem
[13:02:15] <gnarf> I was like "sorry man"
[13:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> downgrade to HTML 2?
[13:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, we only support IE <5.
[13:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> NN4 FTW!
[13:03:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: better than this other guy i've been helping the last few days who posts every demo in jQuery 1.3 / ui 1.7
[13:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[14:07:02] <clarkbox> can someone spark up opera 11.1 and try to run testswarm
[14:07:31] <clarkbox> the run page loads up... but the iframe with the test is 404
[14:07:52] <clarkbox> and nothing happens due to that. swarm should mark the test as failed, or just move on to the next
[14:08:37] <clarkbox> also, there appears to be a prob with IE6 as well. not a 404, but it seems to be stuck as well
[14:10:28] <gnarf> clarkbox: so like what is the commit of what project that opera is stuck on?
[14:11:50] <gnarf> clarkbox: it hasn't been run in a long time and commits clean themselves up after a month
[14:11:52] <gnarf> on swarm
[14:12:05] <clarkbox> im guessing thats what's happening
[14:12:14] <gnarf> i can fix it by checking out that commit
[14:12:14] <clarkbox> swarm should be able to handle 404 bettert
[14:12:16] <kborchers> gnarf: that what it is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/a3a5c65d4dd9eb6be0e8a71d82c3ca86b38ed009

[14:16:13] <clarkbox> how do i fix?
[14:16:24] <gnarf> are you jqadmin on swarm

[14:16:33] <clarkbox> yes

[14:19:52] <gnarf> any thoughts on whats wrong with ie6?
[14:20:26] <clarkbox> it may be on browserstacks end. they are working on some issues
[14:21:48] <clarkbox> im running them fine right now in virtualbox.
[14:21:58] <gnarf> clarkbox: so there are like permanent clients swarming? :)
[14:22:12] <clarkbox> i have a primitive script
[14:22:25] <clarkbox> need to add state, to prevent spawning multiple of the same browser
[14:23:22] <clarkbox> but i have added getneeded.php to testswarm, that will report the browsers the are currently needed
[14:23:37] <clarkbox> http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=getneeded
[14:24:04] <clarkbox> and then based on that, the script makes a call to brwoserstack api for each browser
[14:24:23] <clarkbox> once i get state, i will hook the script up to cron
[14:24:53] <clarkbox> should all be running smooth by next week.
[14:28:17] <gnarf> nice
[14:52:42] <gnarf> clarkbox: where there many older requirements?
[14:52:52] <gnarf> or missing sha's rather?
[14:53:04] <clarkbox> ya im stepping through them now
[14:53:11] <clarkbox> hoping there is not too many
[14:53:17] <clarkbox> on about # 10 or so
[14:53:57] <gnarf> clarkbox: apologies
[14:54:01] <clarkbox> are you aware of any way to reduce the cool down wait time between tests?
[14:54:03] <clarkbox> np
[14:54:04] <gnarf> maybe i should make it like 3 months
[14:54:20] <clarkbox> well after this it should be fine
[14:54:24] <gnarf> clarkbox: its in one of the js files, but i wouldn't suggest it :)
[14:54:32] <clarkbox> ok
[15:13:38] <clarkbox> gnarf: is there any way we can purge these old sha's?
[15:13:55] <clarkbox> it seems like there is a LOT of them
[15:13:58] <gnarf> clarkbox: the ones you just made?
[15:14:08] <clarkbox> i mean the old jobs
[15:14:18] <gnarf> reset the testswarm jobs table
[15:14:25] <clarkbox> is that cool?
[15:14:27] <gnarf> but i need jzaefferer to remind me how to do that
[15:14:31] <clarkbox> ok
[15:14:54] <gnarf> clarkbox: i guess its been that long since opera tests have been run? :)
[15:15:04] <clarkbox> ya
[15:15:13] <gnarf> you might be able to write a clever git log
[15:15:24] <gnarf> to get the shas
[15:16:46] <gnarf> or even something to auto-checkout the sha on a 404
[15:16:58] <gnarf> so it only 404's once
[15:17:05] <gnarf> better than being stuck forever
[15:17:12] <clarkbox> ya
[15:17:26] <clarkbox> i think swarm does have some kind of timeout after a 404
[15:20:33] <clarkbox> there is a reset script in /srv/swarm.jquery.org/htdocs/config$
[15:20:40] <clarkbox> but it resets entire DB
[15:20:50] <clarkbox> TRUNCATE run_client;
[15:20:51] <clarkbox> TRUNCATE clients;
[15:20:51] <clarkbox> TRUNCATE run_useragent;
[15:20:51] <clarkbox> TRUNCATE runs;
[15:20:52] <clarkbox> TRUNCATE jobs;
[15:20:52] <clarkbox> TRUNCATE users; -- Optional
[15:20:52] <gnarf> clarkbox: yeah, ping jzaefferer
[15:21:14] <clarkbox> i think we would need to just truncate run_useragent and jobs
[15:21:21] <clarkbox> but ill wait for someone who knows to tell me for sure
[15:21:28] <gnarf> clarkbox: thanks :)
[15:21:36] <gnarf> clarkbox: people get angry when you break swarm ;)
[15:21:45] <clarkbox> understandable :)
[15:22:13] <gnarf> it used to have a thing that checked out on the 404 page
[15:22:17] <gnarf> some php
[15:22:24] <gnarf> but it sucked and i changed the way that worked
[15:22:43] <gnarf> its running as the wrong user tho
[15:22:46] <gnarf> which is annoying
[15:22:54] <gnarf> all that stuff needs to be owned by jenkins
[15:23:20] <gnarf> so you'd need to like sudo checkout-sha.sh sha
[15:23:27] <gnarf> to jenkins
[15:23:34] <gnarf> or as jenkins
[15:23:37] <gnarf> whatevs
[15:23:47] <gnarf> theoretically
[15:23:52] <gnarf> it shouldn't be that far behind
[15:23:57] <gnarf> but i guess noone cared about opera
[15:23:58] <gnarf> :)
[15:25:23] <clarkbox> 11.5 was pretty fresh
[15:25:33] <clarkbox> its just 11.1 thats way back
[15:25:38] <clarkbox> and IE6
[15:25:49] <clarkbox> but no 404's for IE yet
[15:26:13] <clarkbox> just having issues with browserstack/ie6
[15:26:21] <clarkbox> so im running those in a vm to get them caught up for now
[15:29:21] <gnarf> right on
[15:29:41] <gnarf> you can batch that chown btw
[15:29:45] <gnarf> no need to do it "immediately"
[15:29:51] <gnarf> :)
[15:31:04] <clarkbox> ya, np. i just copy/paste that entire set of commands
[15:38:00] <gnarf> clarkbox: i got some ie6 runnin now too
[15:47:39] <gnarf> man ie6 is slow
[15:48:21] <clarkbox> thanks man
[16:04:52] <clarkbox> k we are caught up to 404's in IE6
[16:04:59] <clarkbox> time to reset the DB
[16:05:08] <clarkbox> gnarf ^
[16:46:16] <clarkbox> OK, all tests are up to date. as of right now, there are NO test/browsers that need to be run
[16:46:38] <gnarf> except the 404s?
[16:46:44] <gnarf> oh nice
[16:46:49] <gnarf> even those seem cleared up
[16:46:49] <clarkbox> even 404's
[16:47:02] <gnarf> thats cool
[16:47:10] <clarkbox> i just created a quick script that refreshed ever 4 seocnds
[16:47:17] <clarkbox> so all those tests were prob marked failed
[16:47:19] <gnarf> lets test a jenkins script
[16:47:22] <gnarf> ?swarm
[16:47:22] <bot-t1> Swarm Status: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/qunit/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerycolor/ -- Jenkins http://swarm.jquery.org:8080
[16:47:32] <gnarf> hrm
[16:47:36] <gnarf> is jenkins not running?
[16:47:47] <clarkbox> im not sure
[16:47:50] <clarkbox> have not touched it
[16:48:28] <clarkbox> server is listening on 8080
[16:48:33] <gnarf> just started it
[16:50:00] <gnarf> new job up
[16:50:07] <gnarf> jqueryui
[16:50:42] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/629/
[16:52:44] <clarkbox> it sliek watching a horse race
[16:56:07] <gnarf> clarkbox: are the other browsers not running right now?
[16:56:18] <clarkbox> they are queued
[16:56:42] <clarkbox> browserstack has a limit or about 4 or 5
[16:57:07] <clarkbox> once i start tracking state, and get this script hooked up to cron, ill turn off a browser (aka worker) when its not needed
[16:57:22] <gnarf> nice
[16:57:26] <clarkbox> for now, the worker timeout is 10 min i think
[17:01:27] <clarkbox> there goes the rest
[17:08:05] <clarkbox> now if only thses tests passed ::))
[17:08:37] <gnarf> starting a core build
[17:08:54] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/630/
[17:13:00] <clarkbox> fyi the scrip is at: /srv/swarm.jquery.org/spawnBrowserStack.js
[17:13:10] <clarkbox> just kick that off, and it will spawn up the required browsers
[17:13:23] <clarkbox> but until it checks for running browsers, only fire it off once every 10 min
[17:51:18] <clarkbox> need to do something about the focus problem
[17:51:42] <clarkbox> someone ran tests in chrome and got a fail
[17:51:55] <clarkbox> im guessing because they did not have focus
[17:52:09] <clarkbox> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/630/
[17:52:14] <clarkbox> that test passed in my browser NP
[17:52:26] <gnarf> there is almost nothing we can do except run a known good client against it
[17:53:33] <clarkbox> couldnt we run a simple test that needs focus known to pass... if it fails, we know the browser is not focused?
[17:53:46] <clarkbox> then stop running tests
[17:56:51] <gnarf> clarkbox: i tried to get something like that going
[17:57:04] <gnarf> but as strange as it sounds its actually really hard to test for the issues we are having
[17:57:07] <gnarf> :)
[17:57:19] <gnarf> scott and i worked on it for a bit
[17:57:24] <clarkbox> ya i can imagine
[17:57:34] <gnarf> and eventually gave up saying "well, we can just run known good clients and save ourselves a lot of work"
[17:57:38] <clarkbox> oh well... maybe we locked it down to trusted users only
[17:57:44] <clarkbox> ya
[17:57:46] <clarkbox> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/630/
[17:57:50] <clarkbox> all done!
[17:58:19] <clarkbox> id like to know who had the rouge chrome browser running that cause the fail...
[17:58:27] <clarkbox> damn you!
[17:58:31] <clarkbox> whoever you are
[17:59:20] <gnarf> its prolly more than one person
[17:59:27] <gnarf> cuz it should let you run that broken test agin
[17:59:39] <clarkbox> ya
[17:59:44] <gnarf> i think it takes like 3 - 5 "failed" tests before it gives up handing it to a fresh client
