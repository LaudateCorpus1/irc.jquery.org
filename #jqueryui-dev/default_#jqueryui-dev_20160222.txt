[08:26:17] <sonali5> hi arschmitz
[08:26:31] <arschmitz> hi
[08:26:52] <sonali5> I am Sonali Goyal from India I would like to participate in GSOC 2016 and would like to work on the project Update touch gestures to use Hammer.js
[08:27:19] <arschmitz> sonali5: great!
[08:27:21] <sonali5> Can you please guide me on how can i start contributing to it
[08:29:15] <sonali5> arschmitz 
[08:29:49] <arschmitz> sonali5: we dont know if jQuery has even been accepted by GSoC yet
[08:29:55] <arschmitz> we wont know for a while
[08:30:25] <sonali5> Ok 
[08:31:15] <sonali5> arschmitz still i would like to work on it 
[08:31:47] <arschmitz> sonali5: are you familiar with hammer.js or jQuery mobile already?
[08:32:12] <sonali5> arschmitz i am familiar with jquery mobile not with hammer.js
[08:32:25] <arschmitz> sonali5: i would start there then
[08:32:28] <sonali5> but i would look through that
[08:32:30] <arschmitz> just start working with it
[08:32:43] <sonali5> Ok 
[08:32:45] <arschmitz> build some simple demos with it just so you can beome familiar with how it works
[08:33:07] <sonali5> Sure arschmitz
[08:33:18] <arschmitz> and especially look at the differences 
[08:33:29] <arschmitz> like both hammer and jquery mobile have swipe events
[08:33:35] <arschmitz> but they are not exactly the same
[08:34:19] <sonali5> Ok arschmitz thanks i would first start with that then
[08:34:25] <arschmitz> sonali5: also look at hammer-time we may consider this to replace vclick for a fast click
[08:35:39] <sonali5> sure arschmitz our project involves using hammer.js instead of existing ones right ?
[08:35:58] <arschmitz> yes
