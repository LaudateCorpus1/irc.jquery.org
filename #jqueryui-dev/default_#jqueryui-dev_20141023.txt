[04:30:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping! I came across a few issues while working on the classes option, including a minor one in the widget factory. When you have a few minutes to talk, please ping me!
[04:57:55] <jasperdegroot> jzaefferer: ping!
[05:00:58] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Hey! Since we're removing countTheme from the listview, we must now document that you not only have to add a class to the span indicating that it is to become a count bubble, but you now have to add the theme class as well, because listview no longer adds ui-body-inherit by default.
[05:01:39] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Is there no way to propagate the swatch-related properties like background colour,  border style, text colour and text decoration from the list item to the span?
[05:01:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: inherit
[05:02:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yes, I know, but I had a look at the actual CSS, and it's not that simple.
[05:03:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Most of the rules are like .ui-paget-theme-a .ui-btn {}
[05:03:47] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: I have to check
[05:03:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So that leaves a big gap between the page and the button in which another themed element might intervene.
[05:04:02] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: When you have a sec, please!
[05:04:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Besides, I want to do it the right way, which is the way jasperdegroot knows best.
[05:04:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... if we do it at all.
[05:05:07] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm perfectly OK with requiring that a ui-body-* class be present.
[05:05:27] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: I am on a call now, will check when I am finished
[05:05:34] <gabriel_schulhof> It'd be better to provide a sensible default in the absence of an explicit class though.
[05:05:46] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: No problem! Thanks!
[05:06:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Another reason I hesitate diving into the CSS is that there might have been a good reason why the listview was adding ui-body-inherit in the absence of an explicit theme.
[05:06:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: But anyway, I'll leave it in jasperdegroot's capable hands.
[05:07:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I have a few questions about classes, if you have a little time.
[05:07:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The first one is this: In the case of the custom selectmenu, should we have class keys referring to the popup, the dialog, and the listview, or should we document that one is to set the corresponding widget's classes option directly?
[05:08:03] <arschmitz> i have a few minutes before i have to run for a bit
[05:08:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I vote for the latter, because having two ways of specifying classes for the same element is confusing.
[05:09:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: For example, in the case of the popup, you can set corners via the popup's ui-popup class, and you could, theoretically, also set them via the custom select's ui-selectmenu-custom.
[05:10:27] <arschmitz> the latter
[05:10:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: look at selectmenu in ui for refrence
[05:10:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. Good.
[05:10:43] <arschmitz> it uses their menu widget in the same way
[05:10:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Aaah! OK. Good. If there's a precedent, then it's absolutely awesome!
[05:11:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: In that case, that means that the custom selectmenu extension adds no new class keys. That greatly simplifies things!
[05:12:00] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll update the PR.
[05:13:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Another thing: We use classes to hide/show things. If we use those classes as class keys (for example, ui-panel-open) and someone calls _setOptions and modifies the value of ui-panel-open, the default implementation in the widget factory grabs the element corresponding to ui-panel-open and applies the new classes.
[05:13:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: This is bad, because the class ui-panel-open is not supposed to end up on the panel if the panel is closed.
[05:14:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, either we drop ui-panel-open as a class key (bad) or we only return the element corresponding to ui-panel-open if the element actually has class ui-panel-open at the time of the _setOptions() call.
[05:15:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats widget specific
[05:15:17] <arschmitz> there are many examples of this in ui
[05:15:25] <arschmitz> again look at selectmenu actually
[05:16:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. I looked at dialog and menu, but not selectmenu :)
[05:16:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: basicly check in the widget for that key if its open
[05:16:58] <arschmitz> if it is break and superapply
[05:17:08] <arschmitz> if its not open return $()
[05:17:35] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, again, there's a precedent. Great!
[05:18:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: See, that's what I'd call a state, rather than structure class.
[05:18:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its structural for sure it defines the structure when its open
[05:19:29] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, but unlike ui-panel, ui-panel-inner, etc. it doesn't actually define a structural element. Nor is it always there. But OK, let's call it structural.
[05:20:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Anyway, panel has a truckload of those.
[05:20:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It'll be fun handling them ... and boy, will it be a journey writing tests for all this - as your work on UI has already shown :)
[05:21:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Alright. I'll go eat something, then I'll try to get back in the saddle.

[06:03:29] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: I think we should stick to documenting that you need to add ui-body-inherit or ui-body-[swatch] to the count bubble. Other option is to add a selector with ui-li-count here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css#L262 but I don't think we should want to add more widget specific classes
[06:03:30] <jasperdegroot> in our theme CSS. Things like background can't be inherited so making changes to the rule for ui-li-count in the listview CSS is not an option.

[06:27:08] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: Just to be clear: I did not mean to sound sarcastic. Blame the medium. I, personally do indeed find the merge-o-rama to be a lot of fun.
[06:27:51] <lisa_deluca> :)
[06:28:04] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: It's great fun watching the number of issues/prs dwindle quickly.
[06:28:42] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: The milestone progress indicator advances quite visibly in that time period.
[06:29:07] <lisa_deluca> gabriel_schulhof: what's the milestone progress indicator?  link me
[06:39:24] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: Not sure if it only shows it to collaborators, but I certainly see a green progress indicator beneath the word "Milestone" in the right pane on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7790
[06:40:00] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: Yeah, it shows it even if I'm not logged in.
[06:40:35] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: So that green bar advances considerably whenever arschmitz reviews a batch of PRs and they start landing.
[06:41:51] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: gabriel_schulhof: ill be reviewing some non class related prs later today whatever is ready
[06:42:12] <arschmitz> just trying to finish a test on button branch and update ui-1-12 first
[06:44:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Awesome! Bring it on :D
[07:34:16] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I'm landing this today: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10534
[07:34:20] <mikesherov> just a heads up
[07:34:26] <mikesherov> $.ui.intersect dies
[07:34:43] <mikesherov> also, looking into that connectToSortable bug
[07:34:51] <mikesherov> hopefully my mind doesn't melt in the process
[07:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[07:35:13] <scott_gonzalez> Please don't melt your brain.
[07:36:54] <mikesherov> fingers crossed
[07:37:26] <Omar-> arschmitz gabriel_schulhof how can I assist in the merging process of jqm and jq-ui
[07:37:27] <Omar-> ?
[07:37:51] <Omar-> I'd love to be part of the project
[07:39:19] <arschmitz> Omar-: the way to get involved in the project in general is just look at open bugs and send prs
[07:41:36] <Omar-> arschmitz sure, will do. But would you or anyone of the team be able to review my "fix" before posting a pr?
[07:41:53] <Omar-> due to my humble JS skills :)
[07:41:57] <arschmitz> Omar-: prs is how we review fixes
[07:42:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: Remember, if you git push -f then your PR only shows the latest commits, not those that came before.
[07:42:51] <Omar-> arschmitz ok, i'll go through some easy bugs haha
[07:43:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: In the end, after review, your PR is of a high enough quality to go into master. All its previous iterations disappear into the bit bucket.
[07:43:40] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof I usually make pr on github website
[07:43:48] <Omar-> i'm not experienced with remote git
[07:44:21] <Omar-> thanks for the heads up gabriel_schulhof and arschmitz :)
[07:44:23] <arschmitz> Omar-: you will need to do it with remotes to be able to run the test to verify your fix
[07:45:23] <Omar-> arschmitz I think I've asked the same question before, I dont know how to test them remotely :(
[07:45:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: Even if you don't update your PR with git push -f, we end up squashing your commits before landing your PR, so the road it took towards achieving its high quality will not be recorded in the jQuery Mobile history.
[07:45:40] <arschmitz> Omar-: you cant test remotely you need to set up locally 
[07:45:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: When you submit a PR, the continuous integration we have put in place will immediately start testing your latest commit.
[07:46:19] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we dont want prs submitted just for testing thats a lot of issue noice
[07:46:23] <arschmitz> noise
[07:46:38] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof I've made one fix before but not a PR, when I prepare a PR i'll notify you before pushing it
[07:46:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Right. I was gonna mention grunt test next.
[07:46:40] <arschmitz> we should not encourage pushing a pr as a way to test
[07:47:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: There will be a link to the machine where your tests run, and you will be able to see the output from the test runs.
[07:47:02] <arschmitz> Omar-: please read http://contribute.jquery.org/
[07:47:06] <Omar-> arschmitz I have github installed, i'll clone jQM repo
[07:47:24] <Omar-> arschmitz i'll check now
[07:47:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: However, before pushing anything to a PR, you shoud run grunt test on your machine to make sure it passes.
[07:47:45] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof ok, sure
[07:49:04] <arschmitz> Omar-: please specifically read http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/ it covers setting up your local setup
[07:49:59] <arschmitz> Omar-: you will also need to go through https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile#development to get your local development enviroment setup
[07:50:21] <arschmitz> Omar-: and the testing section below that covers runing tests
[07:53:54] <Omar-> arschmitz many thanks, I'll go through them all
[08:03:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so fixing that checkboxradio bug broke a pile of tests lol
[08:16:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: No problem. I can take care of them.
[08:16:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... as long as it works.
[08:16:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: huh?
[08:16:34] <arschmitz> im talking about the tests for the ui widget we have no mobile ones really anymore
[08:16:38] <arschmitz> and they are already fixed
[08:17:45] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, I understand.
[08:17:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I thought you meant the tests in our ui-1-12 branch.
[08:18:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I have a PR to fix them, but I couldn't complete the PR because of the regression.

[10:26:08] <arschmitz> very much so
[10:26:21] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: iv closed almost every issue you have commented on
[10:26:26] <arschmitz> thats a HUGE help
[10:26:31] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: :)
[10:27:42] <arschmitz> most of these old ones i know just by reading them if they are still an issue or not
[10:27:59] <arschmitz> or if we even care in anymore in some cases :)
[10:29:30] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: and even the classes one that issue needed an update and well since thats like the vast majority of what iv been working on for the last week it made me smile too :)
[10:31:07] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: good good, hey how do I know if there is an open pull request on issues if there isn't a comment within the issue?
[10:31:19] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: for example, this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4966
[10:31:28] <lisa_deluca> It looks like gabriel_schulhof had a pull request
[10:31:30] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: other then just reading through every pr there is not one
[10:32:42] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: that looks like he forgot to use the fixes #xxxx syntax
[10:32:45] <arschmitz> so it didnt close
[10:32:48] <arschmitz> and no one ever noticed
[10:33:44] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: but basicly anything involving dialog widget can be closed it was deprecated in 1.4

[10:45:47] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: either way
[10:46:05] <gseguin> arschmitz: can you point me at these plugins to remove UMD wrappers
[10:46:18] <gseguin> arschmitz: are these require.js plugins?
[10:48:50] <arschmitz> gseguin: i cant find them right this sec
[10:49:01] <arschmitz> but im really not worried about the extra wrappers for bower users
[10:49:06] <gseguin> no worries, I can look too
[10:49:31] <arschmitz> gseguin: we would not use them ourselves anyway we would just say hey if you dont want the wrappers use this
[10:50:44] <scott_gonzalez> Bower should get the UMD wrapper.

I can split the commit into two (one for the lib and one for the tests), and you should then be able to squash the lib commit into the classes _setOptions implementation and the test commit into your own commit that touches the tests.
