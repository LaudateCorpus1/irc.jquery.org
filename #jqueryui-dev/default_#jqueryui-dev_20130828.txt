[05:00:40] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: It works every time. If you want to reset the position on every open, you need to set the position on every open.
[05:21:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:36:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: pong!
[05:52:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:53:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was just thinking: Is it not possible to solve the multipage nested list without listening to pagebeforechange?
[05:54:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd much rather see it solved as custom select is solved. That is, you have plain old links where the URL is a hash that is generated at runtime and the usual click routing in jquery.mobile.navigation.js does the work.
[05:55:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, like, <li><a href="#listview-29-1">Animals</a></li>...<div data-role="page" id="listview-29-1">...</div>
[05:55:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The IDs would be generated using uuid.
[05:55:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The hickkup is if the pages are to be non-deep-linkable.
[05:55:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there are lots of ways this just seemed the simplest 
[05:56:11] <arschmitz> to allow the markup to be flexible 
[05:56:26] <arschmitz> because just because theres a nested list does not mean you want it to open in a seperate page
[05:56:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed. I mean for the case where you /do/ want to open it on a separate page.
[05:57:09] <arschmitz> right but how do you differentiate if you have both cases
[05:57:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We should really have a <a data-unreachable="true"> attribute.
[05:57:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes i think the nav api needs to be re-thought
[05:58:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and i started talking about some stuff for nav api and opened a couple issues but have not made it far yet
[05:58:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's not clear to me what the two cases are?
[05:58:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: One case is where you want to turn the nested list into a multi-page list. What is the other case which requires navigation?
[05:58:53] <arschmitz> two cases for the plugin you mean?
[05:58:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[05:59:20] <arschmitz> there is not another that requires nav i dont think?
[05:59:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then what is it that is indistinguishable?
[05:59:58] <arschmitz> if you have nested linked lists
[06:00:08] <arschmitz> that just link to other random content
[06:00:17] <arschmitz> the structure could / would be the same
[06:00:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, yes. Good!
[06:00:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The only snag here is this non-deeplinkability requirement.
[06:01:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also custom select approach uses dependants stuff which is going to be removed with dialog
[06:01:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... We really don't have a changePage option for saying "Sure, follow this link like any other, but set up the history in such a way that it's unreachable."
[06:02:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: my approach handles the removal of the page all by it self
[06:02:48] <arschmitz> i agree change page needs some re thinking with regards to history
[06:03:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, then I definitely don't have it straight in my head. Do you generate the pages on-the-fly, or do you generate them at startup?
[06:03:13] <arschmitz> on the fly
[06:03:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, that's different.
[06:03:27] <arschmitz> yes
[06:03:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then you're already writing a click handler.
[06:03:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait!
[06:03:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know how select does it.
[06:03:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its generated on pagebeforechange
[06:04:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There is an alternative that does not require pbc.
[06:04:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You handle the click before it bubbles up to the document, which is where the global click routing listens.
[06:04:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... you modify the href of the link to point to the newly generated page.
[06:05:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats basicly what i do in pagebeforechange
[06:05:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then you let the event bubble, and the global click routing takes care of the history and the pagechange as if it was any other link.
[06:05:17] <arschmitz> but your right i could move it to click
[06:05:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think it would be better in click.
[06:05:50] <arschmitz> yeah i have a click handler already to so i know what link is clicked
[06:05:54] <arschmitz> so i could combine those
[06:05:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If only so we keep it pbc-free, because that smells of nav.
[06:06:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[06:06:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I already have a pbc handler in popup and I hate having to have it.
[06:06:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i think thats a good change
[06:07:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and actually, that's how custom select does the on-the-fly dialog too.
[06:07:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IIRC the dependents thing doesn't even do anything anymore, because the dialog is discarded when you navigate away from it, anyway.
[06:08:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IIRC I even removed it once and nothing happened, but I didn't commit that because I didn't want to face the consequences in case it /did/ do something :)
[06:08:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm something must have changed then
[06:09:14] <arschmitz> at the start of 1.4 i tried removing that stuff and it totally broke custom select
[06:09:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I need to have a look at custom select again, but it's too late to actually make the change now.
[06:09:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we should write a dev task for removing the dependents stuff.
[06:09:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... unless we already have susch a task.
[06:10:18] <arschmitz> yeah an issue would be good just so we dont forget
[06:10:27] <arschmitz> there is a lot to be removed in 1.5 easy to forget some
[06:10:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[06:10:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I think we may have to deprecate, too ... 
[06:11:35] <arschmitz> no
[06:11:39] <arschmitz> they are not documented
[06:12:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ummm ... find js -type f | xargs grep -nHi dependent | awk -F ':' '{print $1;}' | sort -u
[06:12:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: custom select is not among the hits.
[06:12:24] <_|Nix|_> O_o
[06:13:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! Only page makes a call to $this.removeWithDependents()
[06:13:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But nobody adds any dependents, so that call is useless.
[06:13:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[06:13:19] <arschmitz> as it should be
[06:13:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, like, we could yank it right here and now.
[06:13:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's empty code.
[06:13:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No?
[06:14:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: as long as custom select dialog is removed still
[06:14:27] <arschmitz> but before that call is what was removing it
[06:14:50] <arschmitz> because internal pages are not removed by nav
[06:16:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see ... page.bindRemove() uses it.
[06:18:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ugh ... this looks complicated.
[06:18:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and beyond the scope for the beta :/
[06:18:40] <arschmitz> yup
[06:19:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Argh! So, here you are, needing to remove the on-the-fly generated page by the same means as custom select, eh? I mean, for the multi-page nested listview.
[06:19:54] <arschmitz> nope
[06:20:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i bind to page change on remove it on next pagechange currently

[06:20:29] <arschmitz> so its removed immeditly not when the parent page is removed
[06:20:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right.
[06:21:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, you can still do that without pbc though, right?
[06:21:03] <arschmitz> there is a performance penalty but since the page is generate by cloning its acceptable for a plugin
[06:21:08] <arschmitz> yes
[06:21:37] <arschmitz> and only performance penalty if some one goes to the same nested list repeatedly
[06:21:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeahg.
[06:22:00] <arschmitz> so not really worried about it

[06:23:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Caching is always a difficult task. I think it's waaay beyond the scope of a demo. I mean, adventurous devs can always build on top of the demo.
[06:23:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[06:23:41] <arschmitz> i mean this is a plugin with its own repo so not jsut a demo but still beyond scope of what i want to do with plugin
[06:24:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, wait ... we're not gonna put this in demos/examples?
[06:24:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I already have plugins there.
[06:24:16] <arschmitz> no we are
[06:24:35] <arschmitz> i just meant the plugin can do more then just what is needed for demo
[06:24:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[06:25:11] <arschmitz> like it has built in support for generating lists based on json data
[06:25:27] <arschmitz> but that will not be part of demo
[06:26:23] <arschmitz> might be a good separate demo but don't want to confuse the nested list one with it 
[06:27:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, this is rife with scope-creep.

[06:32:18] <doesallmagic2> tj.vantoll: Upgrade grunt-contrib-jshint to 0.6.3.
[06:50:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: Noooo! From the API docs: $( "#myCollapsibleSet" ).children().trigger( "collapse" );
[06:50:52] <_|Nix|_> So, now we need to deprecate this.
[06:51:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: :(
[06:52:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Funny, 'cuz expand isn't listed.
[06:53:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, neither event is listed at the top - only "create" - but, as you can see "collapse" is listed in the examples :(
[06:53:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is it only listed for collapsibleSet?
[06:53:37] * _|Nix|_ go check
[06:54:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, it wasn't in the menu at the top so I thought we never documented it, only used it in a demo
[06:54:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, it's documented for collapsible, not collapsibleset.
[06:54:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and, come to think of it, it may be worth keeping.
[06:54:46] <uGoMobi> why?
[06:54:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not wrong to have the signal, but it is wrong to implement handlers for it in the library.
[06:55:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... because devs may want to know when the user has expanded/collapsed a collapsible.
[06:55:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes widgets should emit events
[06:55:25] <uGoMobi> but we have the collapsiblecollapse and collapsibleexpand events now
[06:55:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, "Oh, no! The user clicked on the "Advanced" button ?! I better prepare for the apocalypse!"
[06:55:50] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:56:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so that's complicated. We may need to deprecate the non-namespaced events, but not remove them for this version.
[06:56:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lemme see how it's documented.
[06:56:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: can i see like to where it is
[06:57:26] <_|Nix|_> Woah!
[06:57:39] <_|Nix|_> It's documented as collapsiblecollapse and collapsibleexpand
[06:57:46] <_|Nix|_> So that'd've never worked.
[06:57:52] <_|Nix|_> http://api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible/#event-collapse
[06:57:59] <uGoMobi> I guess it's small piece of code if we need to keep it for 1.4... on "collapse" call collapsible( "collapse" );
[06:58:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not a lot of people must be using it.
[06:58:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Otherwise we'd've gotten bugs that it's documented wrong.
[06:58:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I think many people do
[06:58:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: api there is saying that it emits thouse not responds to them
[06:59:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but it says it emits the namespaced signals.
[06:59:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's wrong in 1.3.x.
[06:59:12] <uGoMobi> because there were already multiple tickets about triggering "collapse" no longer working
[06:59:13] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:59:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[06:59:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll make it emit both.

[06:59:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: where is it documented that it emits plain events?
[06:59:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible/#event-collapse
[07:00:04] <_|Nix|_> Bind an event listener to the collapsiblecollapse event:
[07:00:04] <_|Nix|_> 1 
[07:00:05] <_|Nix|_> $( ".selector" ).on( "collapsiblecollapse", function( event, ui ) {} );
[07:00:22] <_|Nix|_> That is wrong as of 1.3.x.
[07:00:36] <_|Nix|_> It is, however, correct as of 1.4.x.
[07:00:49] <arschmitz> right so it does not document both only namesapced onces
[07:00:51] <arschmitz> ones
[07:00:54] <arschmitz> and those should be there
[07:01:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. However, namespaced ones did not work in 1.3.x. So, we were promising something we were not delivering, and we were delivering something we were not promising :/
[07:01:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I agree
[07:01:57] <arschmitz> so yes 1.3 is busted but oh well there are no more 1.3 releases plannedd 
[07:02:09] <arschmitz> so this is not an issue
[07:02:10] <_|Nix|_> OK. So I will not trigger the non-namespaced ones.
[07:02:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good.
[07:02:17] <uGoMobi> yup
[07:02:26] <_|Nix|_> Awesome. My work here is done.™
[07:02:56] <_|Nix|_> ... and on that cheery note, I gotta go to pick up a kitchen playset for my daughter. BBL!
[07:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> Please make sure you're using proper terminology, because this conversation is very confusing.
[07:03:18] <scott_gonzalez> foobar is not namespaced, bar.foo is namespaced.
[07:03:51] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yes sorry terminology issue there
[07:04:08] <arschmitz> there is nothing about actual namespacing in this conversation
[07:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[09:06:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was gonna ask what we do about complex demos ...
[09:06:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I didn't give anyone edit permission yet, everyone with link can comment
[09:07:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... I guess I need not sign in then.
[09:08:10] <_|Nix|_> Bah! It reports me as Anonymous :(
[09:11:50] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I should probably reboot after having updated 400+ packages :)
[09:11:59] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:12:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what do you mean by complex demos, can you give an example?
[09:17:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like the popup positioning demo or the listview demo.
[09:17:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or the backbone demo.
[09:18:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess the popup and listview can go into the widget-specific sections.
[09:18:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't want to have sections anymore
[09:19:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: everything in demos/ should be a demo, complex or just simple example
[09:19:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[09:19:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so there is no need to have a hierachy
[09:19:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OKOK, but, like, popup demos will all be on one page, right?
[09:20:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/demos-update/demos
[09:20:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we only need a nav menu where we group demos by widget
[09:21:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Sounds good.
[09:21:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: under popup we will list all popup demos
[09:21:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, by feature, right? I mean, what about swipe?
[09:21:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: each demo in it's own folder
[09:22:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly, that was another issue... we listed features under widget reference
[09:22:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's why I want demos nav menu have the same names/structure as our API docs
[09:22:47] <uGoMobi> makes it also easier to use both next to eachother
[09:23:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!

[11:04:50] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I pinged Tony Ross from Microsoft about the body.blur() behavior.
[11:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, that’s definitely interesting. I’m not sure why the behavior changed, but from what I can tell the call is effectively getting forwarded to the window.blur API which is why you’re seeing stacking order change.
[11:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, I confirmed this no longer repros in IE11 mode where we made window.blur a no-op to match other browsers and the HTML5 spec.
[11:05:46] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Interesting
[11:06:18] <tj_vantoll> Yeah it looks like it doesn't happen in IE11.

[12:11:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I wanted to ask you if you can give that a look when you have time
[12:11:17] <arschmitz> sure
[12:11:21] <uGoMobi> thanks
[12:11:43] <arschmitz> no problem at all
[12:16:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's our policy on top/bottom border for non-inset? Is it there?
[12:16:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm an idiot - of course it's there.

[13:31:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/nested-lists.html Very nice!
[13:33:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You said yesterday that you introduced listview-collapsible in case people want to have the option of adding a plain old collapsible into a list item. Did I understand that correctly?
[13:33:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... in response to my saying you don't really need that class, because you can replace listview-collapsible with .ui-li-static.ui-collapsible ...
[13:33:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if i recall correctly yes
[13:34:09] <arschmitz> also your link is 404
[13:34:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry, wrong filename.
[13:34:48] <_|Nix|_> http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/nested-listview.html
[13:35:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, if that's the case you still don't need that class, because in the case of nested listviews, the li /is/ the collapsible, whereas in the mundane case, the li /contains/ the collapsible.
[13:35:46] <arschmitz> good point
[13:38:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, unless someone instantiates a collapsible on the li and /doesn't/ want the special FX, you should be fine.
[13:38:35] <_|Nix|_> ... with using the selector instead of the class.
[13:39:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... though I highly doubt there would be many such requests.
[14:58:38] <rook2pawn> is it possible to add querystrings in .changePage? 
[14:59:20] <_|Nix|_> rook2pawn: Ask frequent, when he shows up in the channel.
[16:25:18] <sammych> this probably isn't the right place to ask this, but chances are, in my timezone, I'll have a higher chance of getting a response. I see that $.mobile.changePage() has be deprecated in 1.4.0a2. So, what's the proper way of doing validation before leaving a page?
[16:41:13] <rook2pawn> when I .changePage('#foo',{daa:{bar:'baz'}}); imy url becomes /?bar=baz and the #foo disappears
[16:42:17] <rook2pawn> i'd like to .changePage('#foo',{data:{bar:'baz'}}) result in /#foo?bar=baz
