[05:50:19] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Think you'll get classes updated today?
[06:01:36] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: going through the widget classes now
[06:01:54] <scott_gonzalez> Great. Maybe we'll get this in master before the meeting :-)
[06:02:03] <arschmitz> that would be awesome
[06:03:45] <atul> Hi Atul here.
[06:04:30] <atul> I want to work on the project "slider rewrite" for GSoC'15.
[06:04:52] <atul> Can you guys please help me to get started?
[06:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...might do a 1.11.4 release to fix a regression that I missed for 1.11.3: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10669
[06:31:42] <scott_gonzalez> This affected the latest version of WordPress: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30998
[06:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> I've pinged them in Slack to see 1.11.4 is the way they want to go.

[09:23:55] <agcolom> arschmitz: so I just discovered that you changed time to summer time this sunday. In Europe, we're not changing until March 29th... So I will not be able to be back on time for the Mobile meeting
[09:24:55] <agcolom> might be a good idea to remind everyone in Europe that time change...
[09:24:56] <sfrisk> that's really annoying how the US and Europe have different dates for daylight savings
[09:25:00] <sfrisk> I never really understood it
[09:25:19] <arschmitz> sfrisk: it just changed a few years ago
[09:25:32] <arschmitz> sfrisk: they used to be the same and the US said F everyone else 
[09:25:35] <sfrisk> yeah, I know, under Bush
[09:25:43] <agcolom> yes, it's really annoying! because sometimes we're in sync, and sometimes we're out of sync by anything from 1 to 3/4 weeks!
[09:26:38] <sfrisk> I have friends in the UK I sometimes game with, and daylight savings sometimes throws things off

[11:33:34] <leobalter> gauravmittal pong
[11:36:17] <scott_gonzalez> Oh man, we're using .outerWidth()/.outerHeight() setters in effects core.
[11:37:05] <scott_gonzalez> That means effects don't support jquery 1.7.x properly.
[11:37:48] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: is this new?
[11:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> Possibly just since the rewrite.
[11:38:22] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check.
[11:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's new since the rewrite.
[11:39:31] <scott_gonzalez> Which hasn't shipped in any release yet.
[11:39:44] <arschmitz> so explains no bug reports
[11:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> I really really really want to do this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9647
[11:59:29] <gauravmittal> leobalter: hey, i wanted to ask you about the details for the GSOC project "QUnit - Better diff output"
[12:04:45] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so do it
[12:04:57] <arschmitz> i really really want you to do it too
[12:05:17] <arschmitz> so i can exclude all the back compat we don't want in mobile
[12:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> Waiting for _rxaviers to be around before I do anything that will affect DB.
[12:05:38] <arschmitz> not like you promised it a few years ago
[12:05:43] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> Why does IE 8 hate focus so much?
[12:06:38] <leobalter> gauravmittal it's always better if you ask it at github, so I can check when I'm available. You can also ping me on IRC if it's something not related to an specific issue or if you need to talk in private.
[12:23:50] <etotientz> I am a beginner here.I hava a basic knowledge of HTML5,C and JavaScript..I went through the idea page for gsoc 2015.I just want toknow how to get started.Can anyone help me out ?

[12:53:15] <jzaefferer> aluka: I can help with more specific questions
[13:02:48] <aluka> @jzaefferer  should we fix bugs or write our idea proposal for gsoc ?
[13:04:09] <jzaefferer> aluka: contributing code (bug fixes or whatever else) is certainly a good way to get an idea what it means to work with us, and helps to get to know each other. That said, its not a requirement, the proposal is.
[13:11:43] <aluka> @jzaefferer  can you help form should i clone the code and set up the environment ?

[13:28:46] <aluka> @jzaefferer thanks 
[13:32:19] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez arschmitz: are there specific (latest) changes on the classes PR I can help review?
[13:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Just waiting on some minor edits from arschmitz.
[13:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm hoping we'll be able to land it before the meeting.
[13:33:29] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I also want to release 1.11.4 tomorrow.
[13:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> Hoping rxaviers will be around.
[13:34:49] <rxaviers> yeap
[13:35:19] <rxaviers> oh now or when 1.11.4 is released? :)
[13:39:23] <scott_gonzalez> When 1.11.4 is released.
[13:39:31] <scott_gonzalez> Since I expect to run into issues again.
[13:39:55] <scott_gonzalez> Last time you did a release from a detached HEAD, I believe.
[13:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> Because of some changes to TR.
[13:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> I can do the release at whatever time works for you.
[13:40:40] <scott_gonzalez> I've got all the commits merged into 1-11-stable already.
[13:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: ^
[13:41:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Why does TestSwarm only show core 1.8, 1.7, git? http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryui
[13:42:27] <scott_gonzalez> We also have 1.9, 1.10, 1.11 in the config: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/tasks/testswarm.js#L5
[13:43:59] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I plan to work tomorrow all day. Although, my availability is kinda random these days with the new born =-)
[13:44:15] <rxaviers> Feel free to ping me as soon as you get online tomorrow
[13:47:11] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Sounds good.
[13:47:19] <rxaviers> ;)
[13:52:08] <sambuddhabasu1> scott_gonzalez: can you help me run jqueryui.com using vagrant?
[13:53:35] <sambuddhabasu1> scott_gonzalez: I cloned jquery-wp-content, then ran npm install and grunt deploy
[13:54:56] <scott_gonzalez> sambuddhabasu1: You basically just have to wait for it to be fixed.
[13:55:18] <sambuddhabasu1> does it not work currently?
[13:57:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[13:57:29] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: we don't have jenkins jobs for 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 set up: http://jenkins.jquery.com/
[13:58:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: NM.
[13:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Hmm...I know I have an account, but I apparently don't have it in 1Password.
[13:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> Is there no reset password form?
[14:02:13] <jzaefferer> apparently not; the user "management" also doesn't deserve that name, apparently I can't reset it for you either
[14:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[14:41:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I changed the way widgets are instantiated in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7975. Please have another look whenever you get a chance!
[15:56:25] <sambuddhabasu1> after running npm install in jqueryui.com repo, i get error while running grunt deploy
[15:57:01] <sambuddhabasu1> can someone help me out with this? the error log is http://pastebin.com/eE2Lz9A2
