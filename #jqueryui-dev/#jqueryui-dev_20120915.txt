[07:27:55] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/themeroller] Create Frontend to be the package main entry - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[07:27:55] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/themeroller] Add host variable into themeroller frontend - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[07:29:00] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, please, take a look at the above. I've added host variable into themeroller (those two places we've talked yesterday). And I've re-structured download.jqueryui.com frontend a little bit trying to make things clearer.
[07:30:53] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I've updated jqueryui.com as well (sent a PR)
