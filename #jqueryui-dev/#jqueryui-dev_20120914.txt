[06:09:39] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/build-themes] Grunt: Even ThemeRoller needs initialized release folder. Copy existing files instead of building from scratch - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:36:31] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ping
[06:56:54] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I'm currently changing a thing or two for the site integration
[06:57:00] <jzaefferer> should affect just templates
[06:57:10] <rxaviers> thks for letting me know
[06:57:30] <jzaefferer> though in order for the links to work, I'll probably move the download page from "/" to "/download"
[06:57:39] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I think today I'll have the TR FIXMEs fixed..
[06:58:21] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, you mean changing routes only, or the actual file strucure?
[06:59:06] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, or you're talking about app/resources ?
[07:06:07] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] jzaefferer pushed 4 new commits to themeroller: http://git.io/pV5iBg
[07:06:07] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/themeroller] Move jQuery include from body to index template for themeroller - jQuery is already included in web-base-template - Jörn Zaefferer
[07:06:07] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/themeroller] Also load jQuery just once for download page - Jörn Zaefferer
[07:06:07] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/themeroller] Add a root template to show links to /download and /themeroller; fix themeroller to link to /download. Download link itself broke, params aren't properly loaded - Jörn Zaefferer
[07:06:27] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: pushed, just take a look at the commits; there's a bunch of whitespace cleanup in themeroller files, you can use `git diff -w` to ignore that
[07:07:57] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ah! app/resources/themeroller.js has a lot of coding standard fixes to make
[07:08:06] <jzaefferer> yeah...
[07:08:48] <jzaefferer> so the integration into the site is getting better. the download link goes to the right page, but looses the params, and the download page itself doesn't yet look at them
[07:08:50] <rxaviers> I added a FIXME comment there to not forget and moved on ... (so far it's a copy cat of the original + some tweaks)
[07:13:26] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, hmm, but those changes will break the dev mode using server. We need to fix the routes in server.js, right?
[07:13:50] <rxaviers> dev mode = I mean opening the url with localhost:8088/
[07:13:51] <jzaefferer> I changed the routes, its working fine
[07:13:52] <jzaefferer> I think
[07:14:08] <jzaefferer> yeah, it does
[07:14:11] <jzaefferer> still downloads
[07:14:25] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ah! pardom
[07:14:25] <rxaviers> right
[07:14:37] <jzaefferer> and now the server crashed
[07:14:38] <jzaefferer> oops
[07:16:12] <jzaefferer> at the end of a download
[07:17:04] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: this stacktrace is really weird: https://gist.github.com/4275c1e8a24ad1eb2a37
[07:18:24] <jzaefferer> also happens in master
[07:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I have a theme ready to deploy to stage.blog.jqueryui.com.
[07:20:53] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: gah, what is going on? also happens for the fork, zipstream-ctalkington
[07:22:35] <rxaviers> let me check
[07:24:53] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, what did you build?
[07:25:24] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, the themeroller branch is kinda messy. I'm not happy with it yet.

[07:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.blog.jqueryui.com/
[07:32:16] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: all I actually changed was moving the download page to /download, and updating the links I could find to that (and fixing one to point back correctly); the other change was just moving the jQuery include from the body templates to the index, because that's already loaded by web-base-template
[07:32:50] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ok
[07:33:04] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, but, when you got the error above, what did you build? (default?)
[07:34:20] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I got that when I just downloaded a zip file, default, nothing changed
[07:37:19] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, does npm test pass?
[07:38:08] <jzaefferer> I think I found the problem
[07:38:15] <jzaefferer> I had an incomplete release folder
[07:38:29] <jzaefferer> `npm test` didn't pass, was missing docs
[07:38:34] <jzaefferer> the error handling suuuuuuuuuuuuuucks
[07:38:44] <rxaviers> ah!! I need to add a `throw error` quickly
[07:39:03] <jzaefferer> yeah, a file might be missing
[07:39:15] <rxaviers> hehe
[07:39:22] <jzaefferer> probably empty `file.data` property

[07:50:41] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: one big task is to rewrite the parsetheme.css url to download.jqueryui.com/..., when running on jqueryui.com/themeroller
[07:52:17] <rxaviers> one more then: /themeroller/rollertabs (tab refreshs it by fetching server)

[08:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> FYI: I'll be unavailable for most of the day starting in a few minutes.
[08:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I updated stage.blog.jqueryui.com to use https://github.com/jquery/blog.jqueryui.com-theme for wp-content/themes. I also deactivated the OSSDL CDN off-linker in order to load the correct theme files.
[08:52:14] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: you pinged earlier?
[13:23:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: btw - just got approval from todd to change /mobile/latest to /mobile/git
