[06:32:01] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: The geonames autocomplete demo is broken. They now require user registration.
[06:32:15] <scott_gonzalez> Got a different service to use for jsonp?
[06:33:44] <jzaefferer> I think Flickr has jsonp support. I've got a API somewhere that I use for workshops and used on the grid branch for several demos.
[06:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> Great. Do you want to update that demo?
[06:35:07] <jzaefferer> Yeah, I can work on that. We need a new UI release to get that deployed though, right?
[06:39:10] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez: we use geobytes.com http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/listview-autocomplete-remote/
[06:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, that demo will be broken until the next release.
[06:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> But at least we can fix it in master.
[06:43:16] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: thanks, that should be useful. Easier to just update to another geolocation service

[09:08:28] <mikesherov_> hi
[09:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Weird. I can't reproduce that draggable clone bug.
[09:32:44] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe because (as always) my Chrome isn't up to date.
[09:32:46] <tj_vantoll> http://jsfiddle.net/pzT8h/15/ I just scroll down a bit and start dragging the top item.
[09:33:10] <tj_vantoll> Happens for me in Firefox as well.
[09:33:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it works fine for me in Chrome.
[09:34:18] <scott_gonzalez> But I have Chrome 30.
[09:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try with Canary.
[09:34:35] <tj_vantoll> I saw somewhere that Chrome 32 made some changes to scrollTop.
[09:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, broken in Canary.
[09:36:02] <tj_vantoll> http://blogs.telerik.com/jefffritz/posts/14-01-17/chrome-updated-scrolltop?utm_source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email
[09:36:50] <sheppard> klamath
[09:36:56] <tj_vantoll> So apparently, Chrome 32 created a bug in 1.10.x that we already have fixed in master.
[09:36:56] <sheppard> wrong window sorry
[09:37:23] <tj_vantoll> That ticket might not be a duplicate.
[09:38:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: does button-icon-span replace the button branch?
[09:38:40] <arschmitz> more or less
[09:39:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I want to test CSS framework stuff with the new button widget
[09:39:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so I was wondering if I can build from button-icon-span branch
[09:39:59] <arschmitz> yes

[09:52:10] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Hmm...why are you in the 1-10 branch?
[09:52:36] <rxaviers> In order to get api docs for jQuery UI 1.10, we need to use 1-10 branch, right?
[09:52:47] <rxaviers> s/UI 1.10/UI 1.10.4/
[09:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> master
[09:52:59] <scott_gonzalez> The 1-10 branch actually shouldn't exist.
[09:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to figure out what the 7 commits are.
[09:53:32] <rxaviers> Hm! DB script uses master only if it doesn't find a corresponding 1-x branch
[09:53:38] <rxaviers> OK
[09:53:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the 1-10 branch shouldn't exist.
[09:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> But I need to walk through these commits and see if they're in master.
[09:55:17] <rxaviers> ok, but anyway I have the same issue on master
[09:55:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let me look at the issue in master then.
[09:56:24] <scott_gonzalez> No error for me.

[09:57:36] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Have you run `grunt build-wordpress`?
[09:57:48] <rxaviers> hm nope
[09:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well that's needed to generate the files that the manifest task uses.
[09:58:39] <rxaviers> I need to update DB grunt tasks then
[09:58:41] <rxaviers> good to know
[09:59:15] <rxaviers> I was runnign build-pages, build-xml-entries, build-xml-categories, manifest
[09:59:57] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, you can reduce that to `build manifest`
[10:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> It'll result in a little more work, but it'll be future-proof.
[10:01:02] <scott_gonzalez> Though I don't know why the current task list wasn't enough.
[10:01:04] <rxaviers> Excellent. But, do you mean `grunt build`? I find no manifest
[10:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, `grunt build manifest`
[10:01:34] <rxaviers> <WARN> Task "manifest" not found. Use --force to continue. </WARN>
[10:01:49] <rxaviers> ah! let me double check I am on the right commit
[10:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, `grunt build-pages build-xml-entries build-xml-categories manifest` works for me.
[10:02:23] <rxaviers> Perhaps I was looking at a wrong commit then. Ops
[10:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get the 1-10 branch removed.
[10:03:18] <rxaviers> master works just fine, yes. I was wrong about that.
[10:03:41] <rxaviers> So, do you think it would be better to update that grunt bulk of commands to simply `grunt build manifest` anyway or keep the bulk?
[10:04:04] <scott_gonzalez> `grunt build manifest` is probably better.
[10:04:23] <rxaviers> Ok
[10:04:26] <rxaviers> will update
[10:04:34] <rxaviers> Thanks!

[11:59:27] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Would you mind taking a look at ^ ? Maybe you can offer some options ...
[12:18:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: Ping!
[12:18:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pong
[12:19:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so im implementing the fixed swipe cords
[12:19:24] <arschmitz> and iv noticed something when testing
[12:19:53] <arschmitz> our default for vertical threshold is TERRIBLE
[12:20:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[12:20:30] <arschmitz> like not feasable at all since we moved to triggering when distance is met rather then at end
[12:20:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I remember that we changed it at some point
[12:20:40] <arschmitz> that was horizontal
[12:20:51] <arschmitz> this is vertical which for the most part didnt work before
[12:21:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see, so during the swipe you are liable to exceed the vertical threshold, even if wrt. the mouseup you don't ...
[12:21:10] <arschmitz> our default for horizontal is 30px so once you hit 30px it triggers
[12:21:28] <arschmitz> vertical threshold is 75
[12:21:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess this precludes arcing motions with your thumb.
[12:21:47] <arschmitz> so you would have to go nearly straight up and down to avoid
[12:21:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see ...
[12:22:11] <arschmitz> because you would have to go up 75 px BEFORE going over 30
[12:22:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So the ratio between horizontal and vertical is bad.
[12:22:22] <arschmitz> exactly
[12:22:34] <arschmitz> i think we need to change it to 30 to be workable at all
[12:22:52] <arschmitz> then anything less then 45degrees is swipe anything more is ignored
[12:23:03] <arschmitz> and thats only in first 30 px
[12:23:27] <arschmitz> that way if you wiggle a little your fine
[12:23:39] <arschmitz> but if yoru scrolling you should be all good even if your pretty crooked
[12:24:01] <uGoMobi> yeah I see what you mean
[12:24:49] <arschmitz> in my testing doing 30 for both vertical and horizontal seems to work good
[12:26:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/51
[12:26:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: I CONCUR!
[12:27:43] <uGoMobi> that was long time ago, but it looks like it has been like you're suggestion before
[12:28:12] <uGoMobi> I wonder when it was changed
[12:28:44] <arschmitz> so i think for now ill go with 30 for now and iv added a functional test so people can play with values maybe make it a demo at some point
[12:28:59] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:29:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that was before these could even be set as part of mobile init
[12:29:25] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:29:51] <arschmitz> i bet vertical was adjusted at some point to try and fix ios issue
[12:30:05] <uGoMobi> trying to find the commit
[12:30:10] <arschmitz> and horizontal is still 30 that didnt change
[12:30:39] <uGoMobi> but big chance I'll just find a commit with message "changed treshold" and no reference to a ticket
[12:32:11] <arschmitz> it was before the file was renamed
[12:33:56] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:34:37] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/1ef7313e398b3272a776083ecc9f19b467a7dc5f

[12:35:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no reason or issue ^^
[12:36:04] <uGoMobi> yeah, that's the one
[12:36:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This may have been done via PR. Maybe there's some discussion in that.
[12:36:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, no surprises
[12:37:05] <_|Nix|_> There might be a merge commit nearby with a ref to the PR.
[12:37:20] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/341
[12:37:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ^^
[12:37:43] <_|Nix|_> There ya go ...
[12:37:59] <uGoMobi> "Increase y axis threshold on swiping to decrease the chance of failed swipes"
[12:38:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You're, like, the absolute master of finding stuff on github ... seriously ...
[12:38:32] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:38:40] <arschmitz> have to remember too this default was used when swipe didnt trigger until finger off screen or mouse up
[12:38:58] <arschmitz> so a bigger value makes sense there
[12:39:12] <arschmitz> longer swipe more varience you need
[12:40:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, it should relative to the lenght of the swipe
[12:41:09] <arschmitz> so since we do 30 px we should do 30 or less i think
[12:41:26] <arschmitz> once i push you guys can play and see what you think
[12:41:43] <uGoMobi> yeah, let's do some device testing
[12:45:04] <arschmitz> oh i already have but its still my opinion as to what works good
[12:45:14] <_|Nix|_> Dang! Looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6898 ... why do we have to set height, min-height, and max-height to 0 ... ? (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/autogrow.js#L99-L103)
[12:45:28] <arschmitz> and want others
[12:45:29] <_|Nix|_> I bet that's what's causing it to jump up ...
[12:46:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: have to to get what the new height should be i think
[12:46:15] <arschmitz> _yeah
[12:46:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... exactly, and don't touch it unless necessary.
[12:46:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats what it is
[12:47:05] <arschmitz> wait this seems wrong
[12:47:12] <uGoMobi> max-height 0?
[12:47:13] <arschmitz> it should set them to auto 
[12:47:23] <uGoMobi> that should be none or auto
[12:47:41] <uGoMobi> err none (not auto)
[12:48:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you did it lol
[12:48:18] <arschmitz> so why??
[12:48:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's a comment there ... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6179
[12:49:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: about why its zero?
[12:50:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes.
[12:50:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It calculates the correct size by setting the size to 0.
[12:50:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I merely added that not only should height be set to 0, but also min-height and max-height.
[12:50:59] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b4d51581bb245e409ed6a2925f2716613bd29d64#diff-e6800647e0dc4ae65ed3fe0579ff05e7L61
[12:51:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe im missing something here but i dont see where it says why its needs to be zero not auto
[12:52:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If it's auto then FF doesn't return correct values.
[12:53:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm this fix seems worse then the problem
[12:53:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, without this we don't /have/ autogrow.
[12:53:47] <arschmitz> of course we do
[12:54:05] <arschmitz> it works fine in firefox the height is just a little off from what other browsers show
[12:54:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll try setting it back to auto and see if it still jumps to top.
[12:54:28] <arschmitz> with it we get blinky jumping content
[12:56:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If I change 0 to auto, it still jumps to top, so https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6898 remains.
[12:56:20] <arschmitz> ok
[12:56:27] <arschmitz> i think we had other issues related though
[12:56:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll try to remove min-height and max-height, and simply set height.
[12:56:44] <arschmitz> like people complaining about crazy jumping textboxes
[12:57:11] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... setting the height unconditionally seems to have unintended consequences.
[12:57:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't think we have enough control over the page to move the cursor back into view, eh?
[12:57:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or, rather over the textarea ...
[12:57:59] <arschmitz> its possible
[12:58:08] <arschmitz> you figure out its cords and scroll to it
[12:58:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you figure out the coords of the cursor?
[12:58:38] <arschmitz> not cursor but focus element
[12:59:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but the cursor could be in the middle of a long block of text. The focus element in that case would be the enormous textarea, but you wanna go neither to the top nor to the bottom.
[13:00:09] <arschmitz> not sure you can do that
[13:00:17] <_|Nix|_> I don't think so either.
[13:00:24] <_|Nix|_> The native widget is a black box.
[13:00:36] <uGoMobi> we have autogrow/shrink to prevent scrolling, but if scrolling is needed because content is longer than the page... shouldn't we just make the textarea itself scroll again?
[13:03:07] <_|Nix|_> That's a good point. We should grow to a maximum of $( window ).height()
[13:03:57] <_|Nix|_> Well, then again ... I dunno ... we want there to be only one scrollable area - the page - right?
[13:04:17] <_|Nix|_> We don't want one scrollable region within another - or does that matter?
[13:05:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true, a scrollable textarea inside a scrollable page is not what we want
[13:05:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i would avoid that its hard to deal with
[13:06:40] <_|Nix|_> OK, so we're back to square 0. We must expand the textarea to possibly astronomical heights, while maintaining the caret in view.
[13:06:51] <uGoMobi> pfff... why do people put a whole book in a textarea ... http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/65/edit :/
[13:07:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: forget about maintain cursor 
[13:07:27] <arschmitz> if its not possible
[13:07:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wonder if we could prevent scrolling by preventing default on some event.
[13:07:54] <arschmitz> but why is it scrolling when it grows?
[13:08:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Probably because we set the height to 0, so the page is very short all of a sudden.
[13:08:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i thought you fixed that?
[13:08:29] <arschmitz> and changed to auto?
[13:08:35] <arschmitz> and removed min and max
[13:08:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but by default the textarea is not that big.
[13:08:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It just scrolls a lot.
[13:08:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh right so it does not go to zero
[13:08:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, the effect is the same.
[13:09:02] <arschmitz> but small
[13:09:12] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, so in that sense it doesn't matter.
[13:09:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We could fix this with a div.
[13:09:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Put it behind the textarea.
[13:09:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that solution has been mentioned before
[13:09:58] <uGoMobi> it seemed kinda heavy
[13:10:20] <_|Nix|_> Stick a crowbar in there to pry open the hole while we massage the textarea :)
[13:10:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: before i did that i would go the route of clone element
[13:10:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Heavy, perhaps. Smooth - hopefully.
[13:10:40] <uGoMobi> :D
[13:10:49] <arschmitz> visually hide but not display:none
[13:10:53] <arschmitz> reset that one
[13:10:57] <arschmitz> get its height
[13:10:58] <_|Nix|_> clone element?
[13:11:05] <arschmitz> use that height for original element
[13:11:11] <arschmitz> but thats still terrbile
[13:11:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I would presume that a textarea is heavier than a div ...
[13:11:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe but you solve more problems
[13:11:59] <arschmitz> you dont ever need to shrink it
[13:12:14] <arschmitz> because you know if the height is with out changeing it
[13:12:36] <arschmitz> so you just update the height you only adjust the helper
[13:12:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2719#issuecomment-16920433
[13:12:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure.
[13:13:43] <uGoMobi> actually I wanted to point to this comment https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2719#issuecomment-16649279
[13:14:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats to a tee exactly what i just described
[13:15:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I know, that's why I thought the link was useful :)
[13:16:19] <arschmitz> i hate the weight of it but it sure fixes some issues
[13:16:35] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... I can't help but think that a second textarea is not necessary. If we can keep the height of the document the same while the height of the textarea changes it may not scroll.
[13:17:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm i guess you could get the height of the body
[13:17:18] <arschmitz> set it with .css
[13:17:23] <arschmitz> adjust the textarea
[13:17:32] <arschmitz> then remove the height from body
[13:17:59] <arschmitz> but im not sure thats any better its actually effecting a lot more then appending a helper
[13:18:29] <arschmitz> and the height still jumps on the textarea
[13:19:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do we actually have issues reported where the height jumps? I've never seen it happening, but I guess it could happen on weak devices.
[13:19:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i thought so
[13:19:29] <arschmitz> but i dont have one to point to
[13:19:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We could throttle the height calculation so we don't always calculate/resize.
[13:20:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we do already
[13:20:43] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/autogrow.js#L80
[13:22:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right ... NM ...
[13:25:15] <_|Nix|_> Funny thing is, I'm not actually sure how to do it with a div without at the same time using a wrapper. I don't think it's possible ... I mean, what if the textarea is positioned absolutely?
[13:25:44] <_|Nix|_> If it's positioned in the flow, then it's possible, but if it's out-of-flow?
[13:26:54] <arschmitz> thats why you use the helper
[13:27:02] <arschmitz> textarea then it does not matter
[13:27:10] <_|Nix|_> yeah ... that's true ...
[13:27:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ummm ... wait ... what if the helper does not have the same font?
[13:28:07] <arschmitz> you ensure it does by cloneing the original and appending it to the same parent
[13:28:09] <arschmitz> but hidden
[13:28:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but what if a class gets added later on?
[13:28:49] <arschmitz> everything has to be kept in sync
[13:29:10] <arschmitz> easyiest way is to clone a new one every time
[13:29:18] <_|Nix|_> Egads!
[13:29:37] <arschmitz> its hidden so it does not cause an actual visual reflow or anything
[13:29:57] <arschmitz> you position it absolute and way off in no where so it cant effect anything but itself
[13:30:09] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[13:30:28] <_|Nix|_> ... and I guess you can remove it after the calculation.
[13:30:42] <arschmitz> of course you have to
[13:30:43] <_|Nix|_> So, it only exists for a brief time. It's a virtual textarea :)
[13:30:47] <arschmitz> or crazy ass memory leak
[13:31:06] <arschmitz> ass hundreds of textareas build op on every keystroke
[13:31:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... right ... NM ... of course :)
[13:31:20] <arschmitz> as* lol
[13:31:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono ... I'm still thinking of having one long-lived one and just reusing it.
[13:31:28] <arschmitz> but only the second time
[13:31:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Conf00zed.
[13:31:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I had the wrong picture in my mind.
[13:32:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah you could but need to make sure all props classes etc are in sync
[13:32:11] <arschmitz> or its not guranteed to be the same
[13:32:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's the snag.
[13:33:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... still heavy - especially since the bug that it's supposed to fix only appears when the textarea is made that much bigger by all the text it contains ...
[13:33:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Imagine flash-cloning the jsbin editor 10 times a second ...
[13:34:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also remember what you see is not the textarea
[13:34:25] <arschmitz> hats a marked up version 
[13:34:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Let's step back for a second - how often do people actually put that much text in a textarea? Does it warrant our handling such a case? If such a usecase is not widespread then let them simply turn off autogrow ... 
[13:35:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we need to look at other related issues though
[13:35:16] <arschmitz> im pretty sure there are a bunch
[13:35:22] <arschmitz> also im not saying we should make this change 
[13:35:38] <arschmitz> but if we are going to make one it should address related issues as wel
[13:35:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... I don't like either of the two things we do in autogrow - the invasive size calculation and the animation.
[13:37:28] <_|Nix|_> Anyway ... I need to take a break ... this is a thorny issue ...
