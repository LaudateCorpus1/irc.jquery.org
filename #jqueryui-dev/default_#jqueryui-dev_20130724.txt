[00:38:45] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Good morning Jasper, if you clear your cache and look at stage.jquerymobile.com you should see some improvement :-)
[00:39:32] <uGoMobi> agcolom: goodmorning
[00:39:50] <uGoMobi> thanks will take a look soon (in a call now)
[00:40:24] <agcolom> sure, np :-)
[00:54:57] <uGoMobi> agcolom: seriously awesome!
[00:55:27] <agcolom> uGoMobi: oh thanks :-)
[00:55:28] <uGoMobi> and this in 1 day
[00:55:41] <agcolom> yes, I'm rather pleased :-)
[00:56:24] <agcolom> i was really scared to look into it because I thought it's be really complex and I wouldn't managed... :-)
[00:56:34] <agcolom> manage ^
[00:56:59] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but turned you can manage it perfectly :)
[00:57:06] <uGoMobi> turned ^
[00:57:13] <uGoMobi> turned out ^
[00:57:16] <agcolom> yes, it's great! I'm loving it :-)
[00:57:17] <uGoMobi> (zzzz)
[00:57:51] <agcolom> I know the feeling! I left the windows open for the night as it's crazy hot here, and that was a very bad idea!!!!! 
[00:57:54] <uGoMobi> I am really happy because this way we should be really able to switch when we release 1.4 final
[00:58:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: couldn't sleep either?
[00:58:30] <agcolom> no, with people talking, cats fighting.... cars going...
[00:58:46] <agcolom> I'm dead! and I have to go to work :-(
[00:58:49] <uGoMobi> yeah
[00:59:26] <agcolom> my street can be really quiet sometimes, but other night...
[01:00:18] <agcolom> have to get ready... speak later :-) yes the site is shaping up nicely :-)
[01:00:34] <uGoMobi> ok have a nice day
[01:00:49] <uGoMobi> and thanks for working on the site!
[01:51:26] <frequent> uGoMobi: morning
[01:51:41] <uGoMobi> morning frequent
[01:51:50] <frequent> you have a minute for a question
[01:51:57] <uGoMobi> frequent: sure
[01:52:20] <frequent> I have been playing around with passing data on changePage calls
[01:53:12] <frequent> so if I'm attaching {search: "foo"} and change to page results, the URL loaded will be results.htm?search=foo
[01:53:22] <frequent> which is also deeplinkable, but...
[01:54:01] <frequent> when I then go to page B and later back to my initial deeplinked page, I'm adding the page to the DOM a 2nd time, breaking JQM
[01:54:07] <frequent> can this be avoided?
[01:54:38] <frequent> (hopes that was clear enough)
[01:55:22] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah, I understand the problem
[01:55:39] <frequent> it's really nice that the deeplink can work out of the box
[01:55:43] <uGoMobi> frequent: breaking like it crashes?
[01:56:05] <frequent> yes, I have a blank page, because results.html is in the DOM twice (duplicate id)
[01:56:12] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[01:57:58] <frequent> uGoMobi: back when I did my multiview plugin I tried to make sure that all pages get a data-url="path/to/page", which I then tried to compare on pagebeforechange and redirected accordingly, but that was just a hack...
[01:58:46] <uGoMobi> frequent: what version of JQM are we talking about?
[01:59:00] <frequent> latest
[01:59:30] <frequent> so, that would be July...2
[01:59:35] <frequent> not latest...
[02:00:05] <frequent> uGoMobi: let me swap to latest-latest and try again.
[02:03:33] <frequent> uGoMobi: phonecall. I ping again, when I'm ready
[02:03:53] <uGoMobi> ok

[02:31:51] <uGoMobi> thanks
[02:31:59] <frequent> uGoMobi: page is still blank however... :-)
[02:32:20] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah, I would be surprised if it wasn't
[02:33:02] <frequent> uGoMobi: why is JQM storing data-url="page-id" on the first page vs data-url="path/to/page" on all subsequent pages?
[02:33:13] <uGoMobi> frequent: we had a whole discussion about query params, stripping etc. last week
[02:33:20] <frequent> ah ok
[02:34:46] <frequent> uGoMobi: still... if data-url was assigned the same on all pages, it would be easy to compare location.href stored in data-url
[02:36:02] <frequent> uGoMobi: you could even account for different params then, if you knew "the page is already in the DOM, so don't fetch it again, but just refresh the current page"...
[02:36:07] <uGoMobi> let's ask _|Nix|_ , he knows a lot more about this than me
[02:36:12] <frequent> with current params
[02:36:14] <frequent> ok
[02:36:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: are you around?
[02:36:51] <frequent> (likes IRC "summoning"...)
[02:36:55] <uGoMobi> frequent: do you use any of the 3rd party query param plugins?
[02:37:01] <frequent> nope
[02:37:53] <frequent> uGoMobi: not any more. I just changepage( "foo.html", {"data": { "search": "foo" }}
[02:39:01] <uGoMobi> frequent: see "data-url storage" here http://view.jquerymobile.com/old-docs/docs/pages/page-navmodel.html
[02:40:59] <frequent> uGoMobi: hm... no fan
[02:41:10] <frequent> ;-)
[02:45:29] <frequent> uGoMobi: and I don't really see where the id is critical to be stored in data-url. let's wait for _|Nix|_:.
[02:45:34] <frequent> thx so far
[02:46:02] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah, sorry I couldn't really help you
[02:46:12] <frequent> np
[02:46:22] <uGoMobi> frequent: I am not really the navigation specialist ;)

[02:57:17] <frequent> uGoMobi: on another note. I saw latest made the clear button an extension to the textinput widget. Nice.
[02:57:33] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah arschmitz did that
[02:57:43] <uGoMobi> same for autogrow for textareas
[02:57:46] <frequent> uGoMobi: I just did another extension for "action-btn"
[02:58:00] <frequent> so I can have a clear button and search button in my textinput
[02:58:16] <frequent> (plus hiding the search-icon)
[02:58:26] <uGoMobi> right, we talked about that
[02:58:32] <frequent> kind of like the idea
[02:58:34] <frequent> yup
[02:58:55] <frequent> how does the user currently add a clear button?
[02:59:04] <frequent> just data-clear-btn="true"?
[02:59:21] <frequent> (answers himself): yes
[03:00:05] <frequent> uGoMobi: do you think a generic extension would make sense?
[03:00:21] <frequent> something that would allow users to tack custom buttons to textinputs.
[03:00:52] <frequent> uGoMobi: like to open a datepicker... validate... clear... or even multiple buttons like my search + clear?
[03:05:56] <uGoMobi> back
[03:07:17] <uGoMobi> frequent: hmm I don't think that's something for the framework
[03:07:38] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. just an idea
[03:10:28] <uGoMobi> frequent: the problem is that many browsers also add buttons, spinners etc
[03:11:00] <uGoMobi> so if you have a textinput with type="date" on some browsers you already get a datapicker
[03:11:02] <frequent> uGoMobi: inside textinputs?
[03:11:08] <frequent> ah ok
[03:11:09] <uGoMobi> yup
[03:11:20] <frequent> them browsers....
[03:11:29] <uGoMobi> lol
[03:12:19] <uGoMobi> it was already problematic to have just the clear button
[03:12:55] <uGoMobi> and on some input types, on some browsers, the layout isn't even perfect
[03:13:49] <uGoMobi> of course you could just use type="text" to prevent all this native stuff
[03:16:04] <frequent> uGoMobi: true. <input autoenhance="off" > would be nice = no-browser-styling-please
[03:16:46] <uGoMobi> yeah
[03:18:34] <uGoMobi> now we have to add stuff like ::-ms-clear { display: none; } to prevent double clear buttons
[03:19:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I am around. What's up?
[03:19:41] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Hey!
[03:20:23] <uGoMobi> frequent: now I think of it... with the new enhance option you can write the markup yourself
[03:20:25] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[03:20:37] <uGoMobi> frequent: and the textinput is wrapped in a div
[03:20:51] <uGoMobi> frequent: with style on the div and a transparent input
[03:21:10] <uGoMobi> so you can already add a button in your markup
[03:21:44] <uGoMobi> just have to copy the style that we set for ui-input-has-clear into your custom CSS to get correct padding
[03:22:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: frequent had a question about query params
[03:25:18] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hey
[03:25:44] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. Will try that.
[03:27:15] <uGoMobi> frequent: you can just add ui-input-has-clear to the wrapper div, no need to add custom CSS
[03:27:31] <frequent> cool.
[03:28:14] <uGoMobi> maybe we can even rename that class to ui-input-has-button and add a demo for this

[03:56:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I guess currently the only way to change selectmenu options dynamically is destroy it first? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6202

[03:57:48] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/edeluh/38/edit
[03:58:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I'm afraid so.
[03:59:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: _setOptions is not really implemented, and the review is postponed until 1.5.0.
[03:59:09] <uGoMobi> can't fix everything at once
[03:59:11] <uGoMobi> yup

[04:21:41] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hey
[04:21:54] <frequent> can I pick your brain on data-url?
[04:30:04] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Hope there's something in there.
[04:30:32] <frequent> I bet
[04:31:05] <frequent> so I was trying to pass custom data: foo in a changePage call, so my new page is page.html?data=foo
[04:31:47] <frequent> which is deeplinkable, but when load page.html?data=foo, then go to page B and back, JQM breaks because the page will be loaded into the DOM a 2nd time and I have duplicate id attributes
[04:31:51] <frequent> so my question:
[04:32:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This Amsterdam thing seems to be taking shape. I guess I need a hotel while I'm there. Got any recommendations?
[04:32:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, do I need to pay some kind of registration fee? That is, are we splitting the cost of renting the space?
[04:33:14] <frequent> _|Nix|_: why does the first page data-url have to contain the id attribute (which is also stored in the id...)? If it also contained the location.href one could image a test for "page already in DOM" and page("refresh")
[04:33:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we will arrange a hotel
[04:33:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no costs
[04:34:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh! Cool! So, only the plane ticket?
[04:35:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, and meals, probably, but that's always the case.
[04:35:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[04:35:45] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Processing, please wait .o0o.o0o.o0o.o0o.
[04:36:11] <frequent> thx
[04:36:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can reimburse plane ticket
[04:36:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nah ... I always get Intel to pay for that.
[04:36:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh nice
[04:37:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just need to know what expenses I can expect ahead of time so I can draw up a travel request.
[04:37:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I understand, just some costs for meals will do I suppose
[04:38:10] <_|Nix|_> frequent: TBH, a jsbin would be really helpful.
[04:38:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... 
[04:39:17] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hm. let me try to upload.
[04:53:05] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz gnarf kborchers petersendidit: Which one of you wants to tell me why my code doesn't work?
[04:53:15] <frequent> _|Nix|_: bin exploded... 
[04:53:20] <frequent> I uploaded here: http://www.franckreich.de/members/export/l/search.html?search=vila
[04:53:50] <frequent> _|Nix|_: load that page with query param
[04:53:53] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Oh, yeah ... jsbin is having trouble serving AJAX requests these days.
[04:54:03] <frequent> _|Nix|_: then click the Home Icon
[04:54:15] <frequent> _|Nix|_: then click on the search button in the footer to reload search.html
[04:54:26] <frequent> = blank
[04:54:39] <frequent> check DOM, 2x same page
[04:54:46] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Awesome!
[04:54:58] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: only if you tell me how to do defineProperty on non-DOM objects in IE < 9 :P
[04:54:58] <frequent> far from done
[04:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: :-/
[04:58:04] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...maybe a core bug.
[04:58:07] <_|Nix|_> frequent: My first thought is that it's because search.html?search=vila is the start page, and the start page is never removed from the DOM.
[04:58:37] <frequent> _|Nix|_: correct, but ...
[04:59:03] <frequent> if data-url of the first page also contained a path, there could be an internal check to see if the location.href matches
[04:59:15] <frequent> and you could go back to the first page vs loading it again
[04:59:35] <frequent> so my question was: why does the first page data-url have to contain the id vs. path?
[05:00:19] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I dunno, actually ... I could probably find out, but right now I have to modify filterable to not call _setOptions from _create :/
[05:00:45] <frequent> hm. ok. first things first...
[05:00:49] <frequent> ;-)
[05:00:54] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah, sorry :/
[05:01:11] <frequent> np, I will poke around a little myself. thx though.
[05:01:32] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Cool!
[05:02:29] <frequent> _|Nix|_: if it turns out a worthwhile "poke" I will create a feature request and PR.

[05:30:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: goodmorning
[05:30:55] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:31:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what's the bad news?
[05:31:18] <arschmitz> the part of the code that has a comment that it hides the url bar ....
[05:31:26] <arschmitz> removing it does not prevent the hiding
[05:31:31] <arschmitz> :|
[05:32:08] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Terrible.
[05:32:21] <arschmitz> which at least explains why i could not get my workaround i was working on never worked
[05:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> The one-line fix that I wanted to land for a bug turns out to not work because of a bug in core.
[05:33:01] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: oh that really sucks
[05:33:26] <arschmitz> i saw your question in #jquery-dev iv never tried cross window events
[05:33:43] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: dont think i have ever had a need 
[05:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> And I just realized that the plugins site issue I've been working on for almost a week actually requires quite a bit more code to fix.
[05:34:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: man really is not a good morning for you
[05:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I'm pretty sure the answer is "Yes, we support it" but there's a bug in our special events code.
[05:34:40] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah seems like it should work iv just never actually tried 
[05:35:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so im going to start hunting through the code for anywhere else we scroll the page and try those
[05:35:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you saying that if you remove $window.load( $.mobile.silentScroll ); we still hide the URL bar?
[05:35:51] <arschmitz> yup
[05:36:40] <arschmitz> also removed the window.scrollTo above
[05:36:49] <arschmitz> with no noticeable difference
[05:37:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we do different things for Android and iOS, right?
[05:38:27] <uGoMobi> or what was it again? that 0 vs 1px thing
[05:38:29] <arschmitz> well se set where we scroll to differently
[05:38:35] <arschmitz> 0 vs 1
[05:38:36] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:38:50] <arschmitz> thats just the setting of defaultHomeScroll

[05:48:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok did they make hiding the url happen no matter what on a long page in ios5?

[05:49:02] <arschmitz> to make it long

[05:59:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, shall I hit the big green button with a full complement of pomp and ciscumstance?
[05:59:45] <_|Nix|_> s/sc/rc/
[06:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Do you actually use the merge button?
[06:00:46] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yes, I know, I shouldn't, but it's soooo satisfying :)
[06:00:52] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[06:01:03] <kborchers> _|Nix|_: :(((((
[06:01:21] <_|Nix|_> What's the difference between that and a manual merge, anyway?
[06:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> You should be rebasing and avoiding merge commits.
[06:01:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok nevermind jsbin was doing the urlbar hide 
[06:02:03] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, but rebasing a branch that's also present in other repos is bad practice.
[06:02:24] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I only ever rebase stuff that exists exclusively in my own repo.
[06:02:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i copied exact same page to my server and the url bar does not hide 
[06:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> WHAT?!?
[06:02:41] <kborchers> oh no
[06:02:56] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Of course! It creates discrepancies between repos ..
[06:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: No it doesn't.
[06:03:04] * kborchers gets popcorn
[06:03:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry what device/iOS/browser are you testing on?
[06:03:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: iphone4 ios5 and iphone5 ios6
[06:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: The commits should have never been in anybody's master branch. So rebasing can't cause problems for anyone.
[06:04:04] <arschmitz> but it was the script jsbin injects causing it 
[06:04:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[06:04:22] <arschmitz> so im back to looking for the cause in jqm
[06:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I don't have any context here. I just saw "green button" and red lights started flashing.
[06:04:46] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK. Give me one overwhelming advantage to copying commits from a branch over to master, instead of merging that branch.
[06:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> Are we talking about a very long lived branch with tons of commits?
[06:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> Sane history for humans.
[06:05:36] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Doesn't reflect what actually happend though.
[06:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> Neither do text books, but they sure are nice ;-)
[06:06:03] <arschmitz> LOL!!!
[06:06:04] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and now you have duplicate commits.
[06:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> If you care about reality, go look at the PR.
[06:07:02] <_|Nix|_> Well, whatever. I prefer merges, but if we go with rebasing, I'm good with that too.
[06:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> As Isasc likes to say: Commits tell a story. The master branch should tell the story you care about.
[06:07:59] * _|Nix|_ waves
[06:08:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so i got it working but it has one big downfall
[06:08:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Anyway, so, shall I /rebase/ the branch onto master?
[06:08:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes please
[06:08:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[06:09:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you lose the ability to retain scroll position
[06:10:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: congrats on finishing collapsible review! do you need aftercare? ;)
[06:10:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maaaaan ... don't remind me.
[06:10:42] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:10:59] <uGoMobi> nice work
[06:11:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmmm
[06:11:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: why did you have to do to make it work?
[06:11:26] <uGoMobi> s/why/what/
[06:11:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: disabled the scroll durring the transition
[06:12:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/c3f95521866710842b45daf15379cd4c54f6dda4
[06:12:49] <b-ot> arschmitz: Alexander Schmitz (28m 57s ago): Transistion: prevent scrolling when not hiding the url bar
[06:13:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, was just looking at transition.js
[06:13:57] <arschmitz> hmmm maybe i could check if this.toScroll === $.mobile.defaultHomeScroll
[06:14:12] <arschmitz> if it does dont scroll
[06:14:27] <uGoMobi> yeah make sense
[06:14:28] <arschmitz> if it does not scroll to position
[06:14:38] <uGoMobi> it's only about the 0/1 scroll
[06:14:43] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:16:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6081#issuecomment-21483383
[06:16:29] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6081 by mm2703 (1mon 2w ago): apple-itunes-app banner is never seen
[06:16:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i just saw that
[06:17:02] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:17:07] <frequent> uGoMobi: arschmitz: not sure if helpful, but regarding scroll position... I disabled scrollTop/position altogether whenever I navigated around pageContainers/panels. 
[06:17:18] <frequent> when I did my multi-panel plugin
[06:17:42] <frequent> because a container that was using overthrow to scroll would not have a real scroll-position anyway
[06:18:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, rebasing the branch onto master is a nightmare of conflicts. OTOH, merging it into master is conflict-free. I'm inclined to merge it.
[06:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: You didn't run `git rebase branch` from master, did you?
[06:23:26] <scott_gonzalez> Which branch is this?
[06:23:38] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: No, I ran git checkout branch; git rebase --interactive master to make sure the right commits get merged, and then I proceeded.
[06:23:43] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: collapsible-widget-review.
[06:23:55] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Remember, we merged master into this branch quite frequently.
[06:24:11] <scott_gonzalez> Were there conflicts during those mergers?
[06:24:25] <scott_gonzalez> In the future, you should just rebase instead of branching.
[06:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> There's no reason for the branches to stay behind master.
[06:24:59] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: You mean I should rebase instead of merging.
[06:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> When you pull master into your branch? Yes.
[06:26:30] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: How do you handle the case where two different people are making commits on a branch? If I have some commits and I try to push, it fails because the other person has rebased the whole branch on github. Now, I have to pull the rebased branch into a second local branch, apply my commits and push to the rebased branch, and delete my local branch.
[06:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> These things depend on how long lived the branches are.
[06:27:22] <scott_gonzalez> But it's easy to coordinate with one other person.
[06:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> Merging this branch will result in 13% of the new commits being merges.
[06:28:53] <scott_gonzalez> Also, you should be doing an interactive rebase anyway.
[06:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a407376425b1ea3ea7f4bc246dce96f8c2d350e0 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/94c4677325be8ce994bd9180e60bca587c17a2e6 should never end up in master.
[06:29:02] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Gabriel Schulhof (2w 1h ago): Widget base class: Moving _toggleClasses from collapsible.
[06:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> Also, things like: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7069768462651872021f51df0c23ca8f6bb40d68
[06:30:54] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Gabriel Schulhof (5d 26m ago): Collapsible set: Forgot to lint.
[06:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> You should just be going back and amending the bad commit.
[06:33:23] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I did do an interactive rebase, specifically to get rid of those two commits. However, I basically have to fix all the conflicts I've had during each merge of master all at the same time, and having lost the context that I had back then. I basically gave up on the rebase when at one point I couldn't decide which hunk was right.
[06:35:25] <_|Nix|_> Anyway ... this has to end up in master somehow, so I'm going to merge it.
[06:46:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok got url bar hiding all set
[06:48:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so that and button are good to go if you want me to git them on master

[07:00:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok i was wrong
[07:00:40] <arschmitz> there are not tests for it they would have to be ugly sequence tests 
[07:01:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey, are you calling my sequence tests ugly? :)
[07:01:17] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:01:23] <arschmitz> and would only be about maintaining scroll position not hiding url since thats mobile specific
[07:01:26] <_|Nix|_> OK, they're ugly.
[07:01:31] <arschmitz> lol
[07:01:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but needed
[07:01:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I know. Absolutely.
[07:02:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok im going to push changes for button and hiding url
[07:03:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, thanks!
[07:03:05] <arschmitz> then im going to jump into testing stuff for flipswitch and autoinit
[07:03:20] <arschmitz> im not real excited lol
[07:05:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: have you noticed we have had 12 consecutive passing builds?
[07:05:22] <uGoMobi> wOOOOOOOOOOOOOt
[07:05:26] <uGoMobi> did you say 12?
[07:05:30] <arschmitz> i did
[07:05:38] <arschmitz> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds
[07:05:56] <uGoMobi> I noticed I didn't get errors, but 12 passing builds in a row
[07:06:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ever since i pushed textinput to master
[07:06:20] <arschmitz> which makes no sense
[07:06:22] <arschmitz> lol
[07:06:23] <_|Nix|_> Well, if we get random nav errors, we can always restart the job to make the build go green.
[07:06:38] <_|Nix|_> That's what I always do.
[07:06:47] <_|Nix|_> Not much automation in that, but it works.
[07:07:47] <uGoMobi> I just change travis CSS in code inspector... background-color: green !important;
[07:08:13] <arschmitz> lol
[07:09:20] <_|Nix|_> :)
[07:09:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: flip branch can bed deleted right?
[07:09:40] <arschmitz> NOOOOO!!!!!!
[07:09:48] <uGoMobi> oh
[07:10:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no im kidding its fine i htought i had done it already guess i only did local
[07:10:15] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:10:55] <_|Nix|_> Man, after all this merging we're not gonna recognize our own project anymore.
[07:14:29] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:14:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: any branches that need to be reviewed by _|Nix|_ ? checkboxradio?
[07:15:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that was merged last week
[07:15:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh sorry
[07:15:31] <_|Nix|_> The two big outstanding ones are filterable and table.
[07:15:37] <arschmitz> after i do button right now the only unmerged branch is flip which needs tests
[07:15:47] <arschmitz> and ext-panels your working on
[07:15:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz:  I see a checkboxradio branch that has not been merged in master according GH
[07:16:02] <uGoMobi> right
[07:16:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats because i rebased and pushed it
[07:16:13] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[07:16:31] <arschmitz> i need to clean up a ton of branches
[07:16:43] <arschmitz> maybe ill do that before i jump into testing
[07:16:48] <uGoMobi> yeah we can do that after we released
[07:17:18] <uGoMobi> was just looking at what needs to be done
[07:18:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think liek 3/4 of them can go 
[07:18:15] <arschmitz> lol
[07:18:40] <uGoMobi> yeah probablyy
[07:19:41] <uGoMobi> ok ext-panels rest of the day for me
[07:20:11] <uGoMobi> blog post and changelog this night and tomorrow morning
[07:20:35] <uGoMobi> I don't want to release at end of day
[07:20:49] <uGoMobi> so let's release tomorrow morning
[07:20:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ ^^
[07:21:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok feel free to loop me in on panels

[07:23:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats exactly what i feared though
[07:24:11] <arschmitz> id rather see something actually broken and fixable then a random fail
[07:24:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can alter history by restarting jobs ... buahahahahahaha!
[07:24:15] <uGoMobi> yeah, not sure what would have been best either
[07:24:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I know.
[07:24:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats cheating
[07:24:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Here's a new one and equally weird. phantomjs times out.
[07:24:56] <arschmitz> and really not useful for trying to track down the random failures
[07:25:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah saw that could just be the machine was overloaded
[07:25:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've noticed this locally, too ... before starting a suite, it just hangs there.
[07:25:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Might be the new version of phantomjs or whatever. Add a load to that, and it might just time out.

[07:27:36] <uGoMobi> maybe comment there what widgets are fixed and we make separate tickets later
[07:28:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I still have to fix/re-write unit tests for filterable, and look at table.

[07:33:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: GH badge? Where's that?
[07:33:51] <arschmitz> well its not so much a badge anymore it used to be right on top of main page
[07:34:03] <arschmitz> it was always 1,000+ 
[07:34:17] <arschmitz> but then they switched to showing actual number of commits with new design
[07:34:38] <arschmitz> but when you git 10,000+ it goes back to that instead of actual number
[07:34:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see.
[07:35:48] <arschmitz> wow you can delete branches right on github now
[07:36:35] <gnarf> arschmitz: been that way for a while :)
[07:37:17] <arschmitz> yeah i imagine since they did the redesign
[07:37:24] <arschmitz> i just had not noticed
[07:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yeah, they did that because they want to GitHub workflow to work as much as possible straight from the web.

[09:06:18] <Zerhackos> hi there, i dont want to have different themes for different elements e.g panels. Is there a way to define a globald default theme?
[09:06:40] <Zerhackos> or do i need to conf every widget via mobileinit?
[09:09:20] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz uGoMobi _|Nix|_: ^
[09:10:12] <arschmitz> Zerhackos: no there is no way to set a default theme in the current version
[09:10:40] <arschmitz> Zerhackos: in 1.4 which will be released this week in alpha however everything will default to a single swatch 
[09:11:54] <scott_gonzalez> Zerhackos: You can probably hack something together to change the default value for all widgets.
[09:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> Loop over $.mobile, check if it has an options property, and if so, set the theme property.
[09:12:41] <arschmitz> Zerhackos: you could hack something like in mobileinit set the option on the prototype to what you want
[09:13:06] <arschmitz> Zerhackos: and do it exactly like scott_gonzalez said to get them all
[09:14:38] <Zerhackos> ah
[09:15:04] <Zerhackos> kk, thanks for the fast answer. I will try to get my hands on mobileinit. Looking forwand for the alpha :)
[09:15:12] <Zerhackos> forwand = forward :)
[09:16:31] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15scottgonzalez closed pull request #1032: "Dialog: added ownerDocument context to a query.

[09:18:29] <_|Nix|_> Zerhackos: The theme option probably needs to be matched case-insensitively, because we have option names that are both "theme", and "somethingTheme" (like contentTheme, for example, or overlayTheme for popup).
[09:26:40] <Zerhackos> got them all (i hope) the manual way now. Thanks for the help :)

[09:31:41] <maths22> has the following issue been resolved yet? #jqueryui-dev
[09:31:52] <maths22> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9166
[09:33:07] <scott_gonzalez> Zerhackos: This should be a safe generic solution: http://jsbin.com/iyilum/1/edit
[09:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> maths22: Do you think it'd still be open if it was resolved?
[09:35:33] <maths22> my question was more if the solution in the last post works?
[09:35:43] <maths22> Otherwise, should I revert to jquery ui 1.9
[09:36:02] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know. I don't read code that's pasted in tickets.
[09:36:47] <maths22> ok
[09:36:55] <maths22> thanks anyways
[09:37:06] <scott_gonzalez> I can tell you that the fix is to go back to the old behavior.
[09:40:01] <maths22> I just reverted a version, and that fixed it.  I only use ui for dialog right now, so it didnt break anything :)
[09:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> We can try lobbying the browser vendors to fix this, but I don't expect to get a different answer this time.
[09:40:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's really annoying that we need to play around with z-index to make this work.
[10:43:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: textinput understands data-type, but it does not use the option mechanism to style itself.
[10:44:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, it's not like I can .textinput( "option", "type", "search" );
[10:44:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or even .textinput({ type: "search" });
[10:45:39] <arschmitz> type is not an option on textinput 
[10:45:45] <arschmitz> never has been
[10:46:24] <arschmitz> its just part of the initSelector
[10:47:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I guess ... 
[10:47:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: CMIIW: type determines whether it's wrapped or not, right?
[10:48:19] <arschmitz> nope textinput is always wrapped
[10:48:29] <arschmitz> unless its part of a rangeslider or is a textarea
[10:48:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aaah, OK ...

[11:49:41] <_|Nix|_> I just realized something about filterable. It can be instantiated on the input itself when the children parameter is set to a selector that refers to the children of some other element. Then you don't need a superfluous div on which to instantiate the element just to get the connection between the input and the children.
[11:50:59] <_|Nix|_> for example: <input data-type="search" data-filter="true" data-input="self" data-children="#list1 > li, #list2 > li"></input>
[11:51:35] <_|Nix|_> I special-cased for "self" out of convenient, but it could just as easily have been
[11:51:55] <_|Nix|_> <input id="something" data-type="search" data-filter="true" data-input="#something" data-children="#list1 > li, #list2 > li"></input>
[11:51:59] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: data-children should definitely be limited to `this.element.find()`
[11:52:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, then I guess we need to rename it.
[11:52:30] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... because the idea is that it connects to anything on the page.
[11:53:22] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, wait a sec ... it can accept a jquery object and then that can be anything, but if it's a select, it is only the children of this.element ...
[11:53:45] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: However, that's bad because then it can only be set via JS.
[11:55:15] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, but no matter how many times you say that, I have no sympathy for people who want to create fully customized apps with no scripting.
[11:56:33] <scott_gonzalez> What are the use cases you're concerned about?
[11:56:53] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: For example if you have a list of text strings and another list of corresponding pictures.
[11:57:25] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I guess there's a point beyond which we're simply converting the procedural approach of scripting to a declarative, markup-based approach.
[11:57:43] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: We need to draw the line beyond which we shall not perform such a conversion.
[11:58:06] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and having widgets reach beyond their children and into the larger document is a good place to draw this line.
[11:59:30] <_|Nix|_> This whole scheme can work without allowing one to set such a wide-ranging selector with a single line of script. I guess that's OK.
[12:01:34] <_|Nix|_> OTOH the filterable widget already does reach into the wider document to find its input ...

[13:29:59] <ahsteele> need some help with my plugin documentation
[13:30:38] <ahsteele> unfortunately when I released the tagged version was wrong (and has since been removed from GitHub)
[13:30:50] <ahsteele> but the jQuery plugin documentation still has it listed: http://plugins.jquery.com/chord/
[13:31:08] <ahsteele> is there anyway to remove a plugin version?

[13:39:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ping
[13:45:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: 
[13:45:35] <arschmitz> hey
[13:45:47] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[13:46:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: panels will still have a wrapper
[13:46:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i had a feeling thats where this would land
[13:46:46] <uGoMobi> yeah, me too but didn't want to give up easily
[13:46:59] <uGoMobi> I think it's fair to say I didn't ;)
[13:47:12] <arschmitz> i know my css magic is not as strong as yours but i just could not see how it would be possible with the things we ran into
[13:47:37] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:47:54] <uGoMobi> android was messy, WP8 was chaos
[13:48:26] <uGoMobi> so sad because it works nice on iOS
[13:49:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: anyways, can you take a look at updatePagePadding on the initial page when using external fixed toolbars?
[13:49:33] <arschmitz> yup
[13:49:34] <uGoMobi> if you have time
[13:49:50] <arschmitz> ill make time its important
[13:49:58] <arschmitz> not to mention i thought it was fixed already
[13:51:15] <uGoMobi> yeah, there were some issues with panel wrapper and page height and can't really fix if pagePadding is incorrect
[13:51:18] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[14:06:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm do you see problem here http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/headers/external-fixed.php
[14:07:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: or on any of these ? http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/headers/footer-persist-a.php
[14:08:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it's easier to test with a short page
[14:09:00] <arschmitz> that first one is not a full page
[14:09:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: errr sorry, was looking at wrong tab
[14:09:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes I see it there
[14:10:04] <arschmitz> ok maybe im not understanding issue then
[14:10:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: although, that page has long panel contents
[14:11:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: http://view.jquerymobile.com/ext-panels/demos/test/panels/
[14:11:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: can you explain the issue because i dont think im understanding
[14:11:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: there you can see it
[14:11:33] <uGoMobi> the page gets a scroll bar
[14:11:52] <arschmitz> oh it makes the page too long
[14:11:54] <uGoMobi> I also tested same page without panels and it still gets the scrollbar
[14:12:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yup
[14:12:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but only on initial page
[14:12:15] <arschmitz> ok on chrome on ios the scroll bar only shows if your scrolling
[14:12:20] <arschmitz> so i was not getting it
[14:12:29] <arschmitz> i mean chrome on OSX
[14:12:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when you nave to page B you won't see it
[14:12:58] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[14:13:01] <arschmitz> yup i see it now i was expecting the header overlapping content or something
[14:13:18] <arschmitz> this is the opposite 
[14:15:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: on Android 4.2 the URL bar is half hidden, but I don't think that's caused by this
[14:15:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i would not think so thats a scrolling issue
[14:15:52] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:16:04] <uGoMobi> and I think I've seen it been reported befoe
[14:16:10] <uGoMobi> before
[14:17:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this padding issue is a timing issue I think
[14:17:55] <uGoMobi> maybe we do something for ui-page-active while it doesn't have to class yet
[14:18:10] <arschmitz> yeah i wanted to switch to not use that anyway
[14:21:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its not page padding the padding is correct
[14:21:34] <arschmitz> its the min height
[14:22:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: aha, yeah that was the other possible cause :)
[14:22:41] <arschmitz> im guessing its because it does not take into account the height of the toolbars when setting that because they are external
[14:23:37] <arschmitz> but i can workaround that in update pagepadding still
[14:24:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when do we set min-height? only on init?
[14:24:50] <uGoMobi> because I only see the problem on initial page
[14:24:53] <arschmitz> no its each time a page is shown
[14:25:05] <uGoMobi> yeah, thought so
[14:38:42] <_|Nix|_> I think I'm gonna hit the hay. Go a good way through fixing filterable unit tests ...
