[04:41:59] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer when you guys get a chance could you take a look at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Menu and let me know if there are any features listed there that are missing from Menu that we want in 1.9? Specifically things like iOS style menus and an option for context menus. If not, I am going to focus on the tests and docs and get this thing wrapped up
[04:43:44] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I'll do that, but generally at most we want to make sure that its possible to build those on top
[04:45:44] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, context menu should be easy to build on top. iOS style menus probably need some code reorganization based on discussions with james who started working on it. i was going to take over where he left off if we wanted that in for 1.9
[04:57:30] <jzaefferer> kborchers: could you take a stab a Jame's prototype to see if there are any changes that would be difficult to implement later, e.g. would break other widgets built on top? Looks like overall there isn't a lot of code in his iosMenu widget
[04:58:47] <jzaefferer> kborchers: Scott's comment about that in the discussion section is interesting. Investigating _show/_hide for menu, to allow iosMenu to customize animations, could be interesting
[05:00:08] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yep, i was thinking the same thing abou the animations. so you want me to see if i can get it integrated into current menu or just do in a separate branch to see if it will work?
[05:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I just added a comment about key repeating.
[05:04:15] <jzaefferer> kborchers: yes!
[05:04:44] <jzaefferer> integrate into menu, in a branch
[05:05:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, thanks
[05:06:04] <kborchers> jzaefferer: sounds good. should have some time tonight to work on this so hopefully have something to look at tomorrow - no promises though ;)
[05:07:26] <jzaefferer> cool
[05:07:55] <jzaefferer> I expect something in twelve hours!
[05:08:00] <kborchers> lol
[05:08:36] <kborchers> jzaefferer: that's probably about the time i'll get started :P
[05:09:02] <jzaefferer> nonono, that's not how the miracle worker works. You'd have to reply with something like "I'll do it in six!"
[05:09:17] <kborchers> heh
[05:14:21] <jzaefferer> kborchers: see also http://commadot.com/management-of-expectations/
[05:17:18] <kborchers> jzaefferer: heh, thus my use of "hopefully" and "no promises" ;)
[05:17:37] <jzaefferer> kborchers: one more thing (haha), looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/ - consider `git rebase master` your branch before merging into master
[05:18:34] <jzaefferer> Not that those merge commits are evil, but its nice to have them only where they are actually needed, eg. resolving a conflict that can't be rebased
[05:19:53] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, i usually do sorry. the new job wants merge commits for everything so i think i just did it out of habit
[05:20:26] <kborchers> but i should rebase anyway, i see what you're saying
[05:20:36] <kborchers> noted
[05:37:57] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers, jzaefferer: I added a ticket recently about having show/hide animations in autocomplete. Not sure if it could leverage menu's animation code or not.
[11:46:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer it appears i will not be getting those menu changes in before dev days. i have been informed by the boss (read wife) that i will not be working at night this week since i am leaving her with the baby from wed - sun
[11:48:43] <gnarf> that seems fair - lol
[11:49:09] <kborchers> gnarf: yeah, i really had no argument against it :)
[11:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, Kristin was out of town for a full week with the kids.
[11:50:00] <scott_gonzalez> Just got back last night.
[11:50:18] <scott_gonzalez> She has a similar stipulation for me :-)
[11:50:44] <kborchers> :)
[13:56:01] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Found a menu bug.
[13:57:22] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/menu/navigationmenu.html
[13:58:02] <scott_gonzalez> Using the keyboard: Go to Salzburg -> Delphi -> Ada
[13:58:09] <scott_gonzalez> Then quickly left, down, right.
[13:58:25] <jzaefferer> kborchers: That's totally reasonable. Time to make the Red Hat see how important UI is for them!
[14:31:40] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: So Spinner is done? Like, totally, done?
[15:07:48] <gnarf> event naming question in autocomplete
[15:08:09] <gnarf> "focus" is for gaining focus on up/down - "select" is after you click / press enter on an item - "change" is.... ?
[15:36:27] <jzaefferer> gnarf: change is on blur, if the input actually changed. As we blur and focus the input inbetween, the native change event is useless.
[15:36:40] <gnarf> alright
[15:36:44] <gnarf> makes sense
[16:49:10] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yup. I'm considering it done.
[16:49:37] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We actually try to avoid that now.
[16:49:49] <scott_gonzalez> I *think*
[16:50:11] <scott_gonzalez> In any case, the autocompletechange event is synchronous now.
[16:50:38] <scott_gonzalez> I think I prevented the focus shifting when I made that change.
