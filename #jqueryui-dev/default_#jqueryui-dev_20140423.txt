[09:19:30] <gseguin> mornin'
[10:22:29] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: about https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/235 - did you set the env vars as described in their readme?
[10:22:45] <rxaviers> yeap
[10:22:50] <rxaviers> name and keys
[10:22:53] <rxaviers> key*
[10:23:57] <rxaviers> export BROWSERSTACK_USER=<my-email>
[10:24:17] <rxaviers> export BROWSERSTACK_KEY=<key-provided-in-automate-tab>
[10:25:54] <jzaefferer> Do you still have <username> in the config itself?
[10:26:13] <jzaefferer> If so, I guess it tries to use that instead of the env var, you should remove the placeholder entries from the config file
[10:26:28] <rxaviers> if you remove the username entry, it complains
[10:26:46] <rxaviers> $ browserstack-runner 
[10:26:47] <rxaviers> Configuration parameter `username` is required.
[10:26:54] <rxaviers> Have you run this before?
[10:27:20] <jzaefferer> ah
[10:27:24] <jzaefferer> you need BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME
[10:27:31] <jzaefferer> my bad for providing the wrong name in the issue
[10:27:37] <jzaefferer> their docs have it right
[10:31:45] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: does that work?
[10:32:25] <rxaviers> not your fault. https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-runner#enviroment-variables has the wrong name too

[10:37:54] <jzaefferer> okay

[10:38:22] <rxaviers> Launching 15 workers
[10:40:46] <jzaefferer> cool
[10:42:02] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: can you remind me why we're using connect for `grunt test`?
[10:43:55] <rxaviers> For http://localhost?
[10:44:06] <rxaviers> By the way, all tests have timed out
[10:44:23] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, what command does browserstack-runner run to execute tests?
[10:44:58] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: looking at http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/accordion/sortable.html - after changing the order (via mouse), cursor keys still move focus around in the previous, outdated order. Thoughts?
[10:45:29] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: why do the tests need a server running? jQuery UI tests run fine without
[10:45:38] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: any other output?
[10:46:14] <rxaviers> https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/11225730
[10:47:40] <jzaefferer> Okay, that's pretty useless
[10:48:08] <jzaefferer> I'll put this on my list
[10:48:12] <rxaviers> Im not sure how AMD and its json plugin will behave using file: protocol
[10:49:07] <jzaefferer> well, browserstack-runner also starts a http server, so that should be fine
[10:49:19] <jzaefferer> we can leave connect as-is for the phantomjs based tests
[10:50:24] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Committing a fix now.

[10:51:46] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ok
[10:52:20] <rxaviers> what command does browserstack-runner execute to run tests?
[10:52:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: nice, that's better
[10:53:07] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: That was a good catch.
[10:53:39] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: it loads the test page you specify and injects a script to log results
[10:53:54] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: that's the problem, too. Try with "test/unit.html", since there is no index.html
[10:54:13] <rxaviers> where can we specify that?
[10:56:16] <jzaefferer> "test_path": ["test/unit.html"],
[10:56:16] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Of course sortable accordions are kind of a strange thing to demo...

[11:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[11:00:59] <jzaefferer> I'm going to remove the mousewheel plugin from the spinner test page. Its not needed/used for our unit tests and I can still track down the actual issue separately

[13:25:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[13:26:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Pong!
[13:26:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5680 ... I believe this should be milestoned 1.4.x, because it completes the backcompat for the listview filter.
[13:26:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you think?
[13:34:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont see how thats backcompat since this was originally a 1.3 issue
[13:34:44] <arschmitz> its not about correct backcompat if it never worked in the first place.
[13:35:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right ... I guess we never fixed it in 1.3.x.
[13:35:40] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ...
[13:35:48] <_|Nix|_> Well, it's still a bug in 1.4.x.
[13:36:17] <arschmitz> ok
[13:36:17] <_|Nix|_> So, we can still fix it by modifying the backcompat - which I've done.
[13:38:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Does that mean I can re-milestone it?
[13:40:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes thats fine its only backcompat
[13:40:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so im working on something that may be of interest to you and web-ui-fw
[13:41:19] <arschmitz> i know a while back you had been working on setting up similar infrastructure to mobile for web-ui-fw
[13:42:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well in my spare time iv been putting together basicly exactly that its a site to host demos and an api clone (with a new theme since thats not licensed) and it has a download builder to do custom mobile builds including 3rd party components
[13:43:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's awesome! I've had a hard time keeping up with the build changes.
[13:43:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im avoiding that for the most part
[13:43:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, if we can use AMD to sort of reach into jQM for our dependency needs, that'd be awesome!
[13:43:54] <arschmitz> im cloning mobile and just adding dependencies through bower on the added components
[13:44:07] <_|Nix|_> Sweet!
[13:44:12] <arschmitz> then using gseguin builder just like mobile
[13:44:20] <_|Nix|_> *nod* cool!
[13:44:27] <_|Nix|_> Definitely wanna have a look.
[13:44:41] <_|Nix|_> Integrating web-ui-fw widgets with that would be awesome!
[13:44:49] * gseguin looks up
[13:44:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: when its ready im going to offer to host any 3rd party widget that works with mobile
[13:45:00] <gseguin> what did I do ?
[13:45:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: DB
[13:45:19] <gseguin> should I blame someone else or claim the honors?
[13:45:21] <arschmitz> so that people can do a full build exactly how they want without worrying about seperate files
[13:45:27] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The latter.
[13:45:27] <arschmitz> gseguin: claim
[13:45:37] <gseguin> ha :D
[13:45:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and separate repos.
[13:45:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: unless you want to talk about casper tests then blame
[13:45:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, sort of an aggregator. Really nice!
[13:46:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and it will encourage documentation
[13:46:12] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: let me know if you have questions about the builder
[13:46:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, gseguin! *wag finger*
[13:46:17] <gseguin> there is no doc
[13:46:19] <arschmitz> because ill only host if they add their widget to the api docs too
[13:46:27] <gseguin> what's going on with Casper ?
[13:46:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's covered in the case of web-ui-fw.
[13:46:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: those line breaks break demos
[13:46:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This is really awesome! Thanks 1.0e6!
[13:46:50] <gseguin> say what?
[13:47:01] <gseguin> the HTML change ?
[13:47:04] <arschmitz> yup
[13:47:04] <gseguin> really ?
[13:47:10] <gseguin> wow
[13:47:10] <arschmitz> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/
[13:47:16] <arschmitz> checkboxradio
[13:47:29] <gseguin> weird
[13:47:43] <gseguin> hmm ok, then I'll have to find another way of selecting that node
[13:48:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no problem once its online ill point you at it maybe you can give a hand and we can get web-ui-fw on as the first one
[13:48:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Absolutely!
[13:48:39] <arschmitz> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7330
[13:48:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7329
[13:49:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome hoping to get something very basic up soon like in the next week
[13:49:58] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'll take a look tomorrow
[13:50:19] <gseguin> I can change the way I select the node
[13:50:28] <gseguin> it was convenient to select by label
[13:56:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can I merge https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7290/? It's a pure demo third party PR, so I can just merge it, right? The OP has signed the CLA.
[13:56:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This is the one where you reminded me not to look at the PR before the OP signs.
[13:57:38] <arschmitz> you will need to change the author info to match
[13:58:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it's interesting. The author appears simply as "Merlin" in the CLA.
[13:58:02] <arschmitz> im hesitent about using enhanceWithin in a demo too
[13:58:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ohhhh wait no then
[13:58:17] <arschmitz> need a full name on the cla
[13:59:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: however since they have not responded to your comments and this is trivial just make the commit yourself and just close that pr with your commit dont use the pr
[13:59:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[13:59:47] <arschmitz> well lets check with scott first actually
[13:59:50] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[14:00:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i gotta run though

[23:35:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: 
[23:35:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping
[23:36:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[23:36:12] <_|Nix|_> Welcome
[23:36:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey
[23:36:26] <uGoMobi> yeah, I didn't know I was disconnected :/
[23:36:42] <uGoMobi> everything looked normal
[23:36:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: about that panel JS Bin... <div data-role="panel" id="reveal-panel" data-display="push">
[23:37:07] <_|Nix|_> Right, yeah.
[23:37:17] <_|Nix|_> How come they both behave as though it was reveal?
[23:37:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: they both behave as push
[23:38:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because they are both push panels
[23:38:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono, I fixed it.
[23:38:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's broken foe realzes.
[23:38:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's also broken in the demos.
[23:38:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, unless it's intentional *shrug*
[23:39:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't see the problem here http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/405
[23:40:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Push is supposed to re-wrap the text, right?
[23:40:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: only if you add the responsive class
[23:40:55] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see! OK. Gotcha!
[23:41:21] <_|Nix|_> I thought it was a simple matter of changing the data-display.
[23:41:53] <_|Nix|_> OK, so lemme get this straight: There's no difference between push and reveal until you add the ui-responsive class to ... the page?
[23:43:14] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'm going to try to add ui-responsive-panel to the page.
[23:43:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is a diff... look at the panel itself
[23:44:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: push: both the panel and page contents move, reveal: the panel is already in place and only the contents moves
[23:48:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK I now see the difference. So, basically the re-wrapping has nothing to do with the panel's data-display value.
[23:48:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly
[23:48:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks for clearing that up for me.
[23:48:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: np
[23:55:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When you get a chance, could you please check over https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7258? It's super-duper simple, and gseguin has already given it his :+1:
[23:56:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NM ... CLA not signed :(
[23:56:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, do we really need a CLA signature for such a trivial contribution? It's not even copyrightable, IINM.
[23:57:01] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ^
[23:58:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm hesitating to ask the OP to sign the CLA after gseguin has already said :+1:
