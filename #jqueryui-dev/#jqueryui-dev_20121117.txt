[08:39:35] <jzaefferer> Why does IE8 suck so much? Since dropping IE6, IE8 has become the worse offender. IE7 is a sweet little kittie in comparision.
[08:50:55] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: currently debugging this sucker: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/472643 - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/dialog/tests/unit/dialog/dialog_core.js#L56
[08:51:44] <Krinkle> autofocus is supported in IE8?
[08:52:00] <Krinkle> and it is synchronous?
[08:52:37] <jzaefferer> its testing this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/dialog/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L224
[08:52:57] <jzaefferer> native autofocus runs just on page load (right?), we just use the same attribute because its in the web-apps spec
[08:53:40] <jzaefferer> but yeah, I suspected sync issues as well, as usual with focus and IE
[08:53:58] <jzaefferer> it works fine in an actual demo
[08:54:51] <jzaefferer> apparently its not about timing
[08:55:05] <jzaefferer> adding a timeout before the document.activeElement check doesn't make a difference
[08:55:40] <jzaefferer> or maybe I'm looking at the wrong assertion
[08:55:41] <jzaefferer> gah
[08:56:06] <Krinkle> yeah, I'd try calling stop(), then a short timeout wrapping around the assertion.
[08:56:37] <Krinkle> weird though that it only affects iE7
[08:56:59] <jzaefferer> IE8 actually
[08:57:15] <jzaefferer> okay, I WAS looking at the right assertion
[08:57:18] <jzaefferer> and its not about timing
[08:57:39] <jzaefferer> it should never ever put focus on the body
[08:57:44] <jzaefferer> that doesn't make sense :/
[08:58:37] <Krinkle> yeah
[08:58:45] <jzaefferer> ah, it makes a difference when the focus call itself is separate
[08:58:52] <jzaefferer> just waiting with the assertion doesn't help

[10:48:14] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: how do you feel about loopfunc in JSHint, which prevents function creation inside of a loop?
[10:50:00] <mikesherov> we currently have it on, I think we can/should turn it off.
[10:50:24] <mikesherov> actually, maybe not, the only place it's used is in sortable :-\

[14:39:58] <NielsNL> Hello, i hoop this is the right place to ask this question on development: For a big project we would gladly use the selectable widget. Sadly there some (reported) bug's that we see, that is a no go for the project. I have read that the fixes should be done in version 2.0. Is there anyway you can do some of them a bit faster then that... i think we can setup some funding for this.
