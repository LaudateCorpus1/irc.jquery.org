[09:57:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: Color's stable
[09:58:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'll tag it 2.0.0
[09:58:22] <gnarf> It's sat for too long at Beta to bother with an RC IMO
[09:58:42] <gnarf> agree?
[10:01:19] <rworth> gnarf scott_gonzalez won't be here till Mon
[10:03:13] <gnarf> oh
[10:03:33] <gnarf> dunno why - I thought I saw him chatting recently, but I think it was in backscroll on skype
[10:03:57] <gnarf> rworth: how you feel about that ^^^
[10:04:25] <gnarf> I mean - I'm just looking for opinon from the leads
[10:05:39] <rworth> I have to say honestly that I don't feel as much hesitation about skipping an rc for something like color (no offense). You could always do an rc and a blog post today, then final on tue? Or just final today.
[10:06:10] <gnarf> yeah - i mean - it's color
[10:06:22] <gnarf> f n rc
