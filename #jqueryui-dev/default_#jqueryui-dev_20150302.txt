[05:32:58] <Badoc> Does anyone know when jQuery Mobile 1.5 will be released?
[05:35:34] <arschmitz> Badoc: We are working to finish it now
[05:36:06] <arschmitz> Badoc: mobile 1.5 depends on ui 1.12 for many of its new features so they will be released together
[05:36:22] <Badoc> Nice, I'm looking forward to it
[05:37:24] <arschmitz> Badoc: if there is anything specific you would like to know about 1.5 i think all the changes are pretty much finalized at this point
[05:37:57] <Badoc> Especially I'm waiting for a fetaure which is in the release for Mobile 1.6
[05:38:09] <arschmitz> Badoc: which feature is that?
[05:38:26] <Badoc> The Slider widget from UI adapted tojQuery Mobile
[05:38:46] <Badoc> In UI you can switch the Slider in horizontal view
[05:38:49] <arschmitz> Badoc: Im not sure that will be in 1.6 and thats also not quite what happening
[05:39:09] <arschmitz> Badoc: we are writing an all new slider widget which will be in both libraries
[05:39:12] <Badoc> OK it says so on the roadmap
[05:39:44] <arschmitz> Badoc: yes the road map is always changing. As of right now though i dont think it will be done in time for 1.6
[05:40:23] <Badoc> OK, will the slider have the option to view it horizontally and vertically like in UI?
[05:41:08] <arschmitz> Since its not written yet i cant tell you 100% yes but i cant honestly imagine we would remove that
[05:41:20] <arschmitz> Badoc: so i would say yes it will have it
[05:41:33] <Badoc> yeah nice
[05:41:42] <Badoc> that woul dbe great
[05:41:55] <arschmitz> Badoc: in 1.5 you will be able to use the current ui slider in mobile with a custom build though
[05:42:12] <arschmitz> but you will likely have to write some custom css to make it look properly in mobile
[05:42:31] <Badoc> ok that would be nice to workaround it till its "merged"
[05:43:02] <arschmitz> Badoc: yeah i guess that wording is confusing but its because the new widget will be written in ui
[05:43:22] <arschmitz> and then merged into mobile but without looking at the ui roadmap also you would not know that
[05:44:27] <Badoc> I saw your talk on the jQuery conference today on youtube, now i will have a look at the UI roadmap as well
[05:44:44] <arschmitz> Badoc: the classes option specificly is what will make it work
[05:45:03] <arschmitz> Badoc: awesome 
[05:45:24] <Badoc> Nice, i will try that when the new jQuery UI and Mobile will be released
[05:45:35] <arschmitz> Badoc: you will be able to exclude the mobile slider in a custom build and then include the ui slider and add the mobile classes to it for style
[05:46:49] <Badoc> That sounds very easy
[05:47:29] <arschmitz> Badoc: yes hopefully :-)
[05:48:03] <Badoc> Yeah, i like your project. Its awesome. Keep it up!
[05:48:32] <arschmitz> Badoc: Awesome thank you! We have lots more awesome coming in the future too!
[05:49:03] <Badoc> I will follow the development, because i use UI and Mobile very often
[05:49:33] <arschmitz> Badoc: great! we have been working hard to bring the projects together
[05:50:55] <Badoc> Yeah, I love that approach because it was not very usable togehter 
[05:54:28] <Badoc> So thanks for the information i wish you much success with your projects
[05:55:00] <arschmitz> Badoc: thank you

[11:13:24] <bobvann> hello I'd like to talk with somebody about the gsoc
[11:30:03] <saketh> hello
[11:37:16] <Guest56602> hello
[11:37:22] <Guest56602> any one here?
[11:43:06] <arschmitz> bobvann: hi
[11:43:13] <arschmitz> Guest56602: Hi
[11:43:54] <arschmitz> bobvann: what specifically can i help you with? 
[11:44:40] <Guest56602> ok so the mentoring organisations for the gsoc 2015 have been announced and jquery foundation is one of them right?
[11:45:05] <arschmitz> Yes
[11:45:14] <arschmitz> we just found out a few minutes ago :-)
[11:48:33] <prasun__> Hi I saw this project https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/96. I can do this project.
[11:48:49] <prasun__> How to get started?
[11:49:30] <Guest56602> same. exactly
[11:49:52] <arschmitz> Ok have had several other people already ask about this one too
[11:51:30] <arschmitz> It's not possible to actually start on this right now because we are waiting on some infrastructure thats not in place yet
[11:52:05] <arschmitz> This will hopefully be in place soon
[11:53:12] <arschmitz> this particular project is also likely to tie in with the creating intueractive tutorials for the learning center as that may be through the same JSBIN interface we plan to use to make the demos editable 
[11:54:37] <prasun__> hmm, interesting
[11:55:33] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15louisdoe opened issue #7982: two clicks needed on select buttons to open dialog page 02http://git.io/xzCD
[11:56:51] <prasun__> i also saw the "slider rewrite". How can I get started with this one?
[11:56:57] <Guest56602> so when can we expect the project to be in place?
[11:59:02] <bobvann> I would like to know more about the project "new demo system"... what's exactly the goal of the project
[11:59:03] <arschmitz> for the ui demos i have no timeline its not an issue of work but working with jsbin 
[11:59:16] <arschmitz> bobvann: Read backscroll 
[11:59:59] <bobvann> ah ok sorry
[12:00:11] <arschmitz> prasun__: for the slider all new ui widgets start as pages in http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137947/FrontPage
[12:00:17] <Guest56602> u mean getting jsbin onto tthe demo pages?
[12:00:21] <arschmitz> bobvann: no problem just lots of interest in that task
[12:00:26] <arschmitz> Guest56602: yes
[12:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1451
[12:00:57] <prasun__> arschmitz: thanks
[12:01:23] <Guest56602> i think i have an idea. but not sure though
[12:02:07] <arschmitz> Guest56602: do you mean how to make that work?
[12:03:28] <Guest56602> maybe. if all we need is to get the jsbin editor with output,html,js,css frames , i think i can 
[12:03:46] <Guest56602> i am a novice so i am not quite sure
[12:04:03] <arschmitz> Guest56602: no what we want is you click the example and actually go to that example in jsbin
[12:04:11] <arschmitz> and the bins will be autogenerated with their api
[12:04:38] <arschmitz> and be under a subdomain like jqueryui.jsbin.com
[12:04:55] <arschmitz> Part of this depends on us setting up accounts and some other things with JSBin
[12:05:11] <arschmitz> we are working on this but until those things are inplace we cant do much for this task
[12:07:39] <Guest56602> okay..
[12:08:31] <gauravmittal> hey, how to start on "QUnit - Better diff output"??
[12:09:11] <arschmitz> gauravmittal: jzaefferer and leobalter are the people for that one
[12:09:28] <gauravmittal> arschmitz: Thanks
[12:10:17] <gauravmittal> leobalter: ping ^^
[12:10:44] <arschmitz> gauravmittal: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/335 https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/364 https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/363
[12:10:55] <arschmitz> are all issues to look at for some background on that
[12:11:10] <gauravmittal> arschmitz: Thanks again :)
[12:11:29] <arschmitz> gauravmittal: no problem
[12:17:48] <prasun__> Hi, I am an opensource contributor and a web developer. I am interested in contributing to the jquery foundation. Please, grant me access. 
[12:17:58] <prasun__> oh sorry :(
[12:18:23] <prasun__> plz don't mind that
[12:19:46] <hait> Hi.
[12:20:07] <arschmitz> hait: hi
[12:20:08] <hait> I am a Javascript and CSS developer. 
[12:20:13] <Guest56602> arschmitz : how about this : http://jsfiddle.net/1kcj4xt7/  scroll down in the fiddle result and check my version of "editable demo"
[12:20:14] <hait> How can I help. :)
[12:21:09] <hait> arschmitz: Can you suggest me how to start contributing to the code?
[12:23:05] <arschmitz> hait: do you mean in general or is this for GSoC?
[12:24:12] <hait> arschmitz: for GSoC.
[12:24:43] <arschmitz> hait: i would pick a task your interested in and then we can point you in the right direction for that task
[12:25:05] <hait> arschmitz: Sure.
[12:26:16] <Guest56602> arschmitz : did you check out the fiddle?
[12:28:08] <jqcommit> [13demos.jquerymobile.com] 15oskosk opened issue #16: The 'view source' on every demo, adds special white characters when copied to clipboard 02http://git.io/xzPc
[12:28:10] <arschmitz> Guest56602: i have not had a chance
[12:29:43] <Guest56602> will you please look at it once? i embedded jsbin into one of the examples and it is editable and responsive now
[12:33:56] <arschmitz> Guest56602: The idea would be something like that but only showing the output and have a banner you ccould clikc in the corner to go to the full view
[12:34:10] <arschmitz> Guest56602: also the real task to to make this be automated as part of the release process
[12:34:14] <arschmitz> and be done with the jsbin api
[12:37:00] <Guest56602> arschmitz : you mean all the examples will be automatically generating a bin?
[12:37:24] <arschmitz> no the release script or something will generate the from page in the jquery-ui repo
[12:38:52] <Guest56602> okay.. thanks. but now that i am really interested in this project, how do i get notified about the placement of this?
[12:39:14] <arschmitz> Guest56602: you will have to bear with us
[12:39:32] <Guest56602> hehe okay. 
[12:39:41] <arschmitz> there have been many people interested and we need to figure out how we are going to handle everything
[12:40:15] <Guest56602> yeah i get it
[12:42:12] <interestinall> I just want to say thanks again for taking the time to help me get oriented. I'll be back around here tomorrow and at the meeting. Have a good day :)
[12:44:22] <interestinall> That was for arschmitz. Been staring at the computer for too long. lol

[15:57:47] <gauravmittal> hey, i am new to this project. I was just checking out the code. I wanted to ask whether there is a need for assert.greaterThan and assert.lesserThan functions??
[16:00:34] <gauravmittal> arschmitz:  ^ there are asserts for equals, should there be asserts for less than  or greather than??
[16:04:10] <arschmitz> gauravmittal: i dont work on qunit but im going to guess they would say you should just do ok( a > b, "message" )
[16:05:08] <arschmitz> gauravmittal: the question you asked about earlier was specifically about the diff output for failed tests on large objects i believe if thats still what your looking at
[16:05:34] <gauravmittal> arschmitz: yes, i want to work on that
[16:06:50] <gauravmittal> arschmitz: but since this is my first time working on this project, m reading the code and i got a doubt in the greater than and lesser than.
[16:07:13] <arschmitz> ok
[16:07:27] <gauravmittal> arschmitz: Can u tell me who are the mentors for qunit?
[16:08:06] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: and leobalter: I use qunit a lot and have written some plugins and stuff so if they are not around i can help but they can give much better answers then i can 
[16:09:04] <gauravmittal> arschmitz: Thanks :)
[16:12:12] <gauravmittal> arschmitz: So what i wanted to ask was, since ok can be used for about all the asserts, we still use equal, deepequal, etc for asserting. Similarly shouldn't there be particular for lesser than and greater than functions as well? Many unit testing frameworks use these notations
[16:14:08] <arschmitz> gauravmittal: on that one all i can say is thats what i would guess but i dont work on the qunit team
[16:15:25] <gauravmittal> arschmitz: so can i open a issue on github regarding this?? or submit a PR??
[16:16:12] <arschmitz> i would open an issue and see what they say before doing a pr
[16:16:40] <gauravmittal> arschmitz: thanks. Will do that.
[18:18:37] <leobalter> hey gauravmittal, I've been stuck on meetings all day long today,  but I'll have some free time this week and I'll be more available on the jQuery projects
