[10:03:21] <Unode|Work> hi everyone
[10:03:58] <gnarf> hello
[10:04:04] <Unode|Work> I'm having some issues with setting maxWidth and maxHeight on a dialog using the latest JQuery UI.
[10:04:13] <Unode|Work> Testcase on http://jsfiddle.net/xKPfg/1/
[10:04:47] <Unode|Work> I'm not sure if this is a known problem or me misusing the parameters
[10:05:33] <Unode|Work> The maxHeight parameter for instance, is only applied if you try to resize the dialog window
[10:09:34] <Unode|Work> I forgot to say this was tested on Chromium and Firefox 5
[10:10:28] <gnarf> might have better luck with support issues in #jquery
[10:12:56] <kborchers> Unode|Work: this is a known bug http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4820 feel free to fix it and submit a pull request at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[10:13:00] <Unode|Work> I asked the question there, but since this looks like a bug I was just hoping for some yes/no feedback
[10:13:06] <Unode|Work> oh there you go, thanks :)
[10:44:59] <jzaefferer> hey gnarf, scott_gonzalez, feel free to start reviewing PRs without me and let me know if there's one where I can help out
[10:45:16] <jzaefferer> unlike Kris I'll be able to join the Skype call though ;)
[10:46:03] <kborchers> jzaefferer: :P
[10:48:31] <gnarf> afk ~5-10 then back for pulls
[10:53:00] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/4415e992c5ef0f280309acc34e6903e7161a6ac9
[10:53:00] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Accordion tests: cleanup. - Scott González
[10:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> everyone with an opinion about markup, please scrutinize this page as much as possible: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/accordion/accordion.html
[10:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> be as picky as you want, nit-pick the tiniest of things
[10:54:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to have one perfect page as a reference so we can finish the cleanup on other pages and finally have good, consistent code
[10:55:09] <gnarf> back
[10:56:40] <gnarf> updating http://oksoclap.com/ui-pull-requests
[10:58:49] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I've got a meeting in 2 minutes that I forgot about :-/
[10:59:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: fun - I'm just gonna update this list with my comments then, ping me when yer back :)
[11:00:53] <gnarf> jzaefferer: got an opinion on http://jqbug.com/ui/p325
[11:01:20] <gnarf> should we pull it or do you want to wait longer for his response? :)
[11:04:13] <jzaefferer> can you send him a message via github?
[11:04:29] <gnarf> sure
[11:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: our actual goal is to stop using ant
[11:04:32] <jzaefferer> without that cleanup the whole thing is rather silly..
[11:07:15] <gnarf> done
[11:07:40] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/373 - No ticket? Bad coding standards? No response for a month
[11:08:39] <gnarf> same general situation with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/366
[11:09:51] <kborchers> i am merging the tests from http://jqbug.com/ui/p190 and in the current version of the files in master, the white space is a mess. should i go ahead and fix that and if so, in a separate whitespace commit or all together?
[11:10:27] <gnarf> kborchers: you're saying the whitespace is messy in master?
[11:10:36] <kborchers> yes
[11:10:43] <gnarf> i'd put it on its own commit, then apply your changes on top
[11:11:12] <gnarf> makes it easier to see the actual changes to the file if you can look at the whitespace & test separately
[11:11:30] <kborchers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/position/position.html#L38 through L63 is pretty much all done with spaces not tabs
[11:12:11] <kborchers> ok, i'll clean it up
[11:13:14] <gnarf> man, datepicker is a mess
[11:13:39] <kborchers> heh ... you just noticed that?
[11:13:51] <jzaefferer> gnarf, can you not add notes on implementation status to the functional spec? if you want to track todos, just put them in the header, ala Menu
[11:14:26] <gnarf> jzaefferer: k
[11:16:29] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/379 hrm - u think this should be escaping " in the id too?
[11:17:24] <gnarf> if not, i think that one is pullable ( might want to add a test )
[11:17:29] <jzaefferer> looks valid: 'fails for ids with ":"'
[11:17:40] <jzaefferer> if that's actually the case
[11:17:54] <gnarf> I'll draft up a unit to go with it
[11:19:37] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/382 = more datepicker API bloat ?
[11:20:39] <kborchers> should i go ahead and delete this commented out test now https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/position/position_core.js#L519
[11:21:12] <gnarf> kborchers: does it work if you uncomment?
[11:23:45] <kborchers> i'm not sure if it ever would have passed, it's comparing objects
[11:24:52] <kborchers> the left and top inside are equal but the the objects are obviously not
[11:26:44] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/396/files actually looks pullable
[11:32:29] <kborchers> doh, i was looking at the wrong one ... that test does pass
[11:33:15] <kborchers> but the point was we are nolonger avoiding fractional values with this update so that test is pointless now ... hence the desire to delete it
[11:33:52] * gnarf bunts
[11:53:59] <ajpiano> hey scott_gonzalez, have you ever written chrome extensions
[11:54:06] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:54:57] <ajpiano> there seems to be a lot of uncomfortable issues in jquery core with offset and the chrome extension environment that make it impossible to use anything that needs to be positioned
[11:55:21] <ajpiano> tooltip datepicker dialog etc
[11:55:40] <ajpiano> was curious if you'd hapened to wade into this maelstrom
[12:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> nope, but would be interesting to look into
[12:09:38] <jzaefferer> so kborchers, can we merge 418?
[12:09:45] <jzaefferer> btw. scott_gonzalez, check Skype
[12:10:47] <kborchers> yes, i believe it is ready now
[12:12:16] <jzaefferer> cool, will land it tomorrow after verifying
[12:13:26] <jzaefferer> btw. welcome Justin_o! Its Justin Obara, a few of us met him in Toronto at the ARIA Hackathon. A small first step in more collaboration between them and our effort
[12:13:48] <Justin_o> jzaefferer: thanks for the welcome :)
[12:17:21] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers, in regards to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/414/files#L1R470 - what I meant (again not very clear) was to add that to the demo code itself; though I've been wondering if this is actually okay; gnarf, scott_gonzalez, any opinions? should a ctrl+click not cause a select even on the menu?
[12:18:32] <kborchers> i had done it in the demo at first but thought it made more sense to go ahead and put it in menu.
[12:18:32] <gnarf> i would think you'd want it to cause a select, unless it opens in a new window
[12:18:59] <gnarf> even then, if you are handling the open in new window in the select event, u need it still :)
[12:19:32] <kborchers> i figured there would be no need for the select to happen since the person creating the navigation menu didn't intend for them to still be on that page anyway
[12:20:25] <kborchers> so they probably wouldn't care if the select happened just because the user forced the link to open in a new window
[12:20:50] <gnarf> it might be nice to know they opened in a new window
[12:20:56] <gnarf> or wanted to open in a new window
[12:21:13] <gnarf> but i also see the point of canceling / ignoring those
[12:21:35] <gnarf> i would think that if the end user wants to ignore ctrlKey clicks, they can check the originalEvent right?
[12:23:55] <scott_gonzalez> menu shouldn't care about modifier keys
[12:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> again, this is the app vs. web war
[12:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> we can't possibly do the right thing
[12:24:16] <gnarf> let the end user handle it
[12:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> I think at this point, we're going down the build an app path
[12:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> which I think is gonna be really painful
[12:25:15] <gnarf> couldn't we make our own subclass of menu for navmenu ?
[12:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:25:28] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: that would need to be 100% ARIA-less
[12:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> which is part of the app vs. web problem
[12:25:47] <gnarf> hrm
[12:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> ARIA is not about accessible web pages
[12:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> it's about accessible apps
[12:26:15] <gnarf> i see what you're sayin
[12:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> which I'm starting to think might be the reason YUI ships ARIA extensions for their widgets
[12:27:16] <scott_gonzalez> there's no OS-level equivalent of a menu option that changes the page you're on
[12:28:41] <scott_gonzalez> maybe we can see what accessible info is provided for things like Adium's Window -> Chats menu options
[12:29:05] <scott_gonzalez> Colloquy doesn't seem to have any equivalent of that
[12:30:30] <kborchers> ok, moved that over into the demo https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/414
[12:38:30] <jzaefferer> what's the deal with $( ui.item[0] )? why not just use ui.item?
[12:41:02] <kborchers> wow ... all i can say is facepalm
[12:41:16] <kborchers> one sec, i'll fix it
[12:41:28] <gnarf> heh
[12:43:29] <kborchers> updated
[12:44:01] <jzaefferer> btw. there's an emoticon for facepalm: m(
[12:44:22] <kborchers> heh, i think i've been spending too much time in #jquery
[12:44:37] <jzaefferer> while we're nitpicking, can you fix the whitespace here: if( 
[12:44:49] <kborchers> crap
[12:44:56] <jzaefferer> a pre-commit-hook formatting checker would be sweet :-)
[12:45:40] <kborchers> updated ... again
[12:46:13] <jzaefferer> btw. gnarf, the drawback of you working on mask in a mask branch: 'git co ma' no longer autocompletes to 'git co master', it stops at 'mas' :/
[12:46:38] <jzaefferer> which reminds me that I wanted to alias 'git' to 'g'...
[12:46:54] <gnarf> sorry jzaefferer - I'll remember to use some other name that makes less sense next time ;)
[12:47:04] <jzaefferer> heh :p
[12:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout autoplacesymbolsinmyinputandrestrictwhatuserscantype
[12:47:33] <kborchers> lol
[12:47:38] <gnarf> perfect!
[12:48:32] <jzaefferer> as long as all I have to type is "g co au", that's fine by me :-)
[12:49:07] <jzaefferer> have I mentioned that git-autocomplete is totally awesome?
[12:50:19] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers, can you also add the new demo to menu/index.html?
[12:50:42] <kborchers> one of these days i'll get it on the first try :/
[12:50:49] <jzaefferer> :-)
[12:51:08] <jzaefferer> while you're at it, you could rebase your branch, then I can do a fast-forward and no merge commit \o/
[12:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, gnarf, kborchers: anything you'd change in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/accordion/accordion.html ?
[12:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> location of blank lines, order of tags in head, anything?
[12:52:22] <scott_gonzalez> indentation of anything
[12:52:51] <jzaefferer> looks fine to me
[12:53:09] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:53:16] <gnarf> same, although the indented head, but body not feels a lil odd
[12:53:27] <gnarf> it makes sense tho
[12:54:57] <scott_gonzalez> heh, yeah, a long time ago I stopped indenting the body
[12:55:25] <scott_gonzalez> probably after I realized how much I hated that people would do stuff like indenting an entire PHP file after the opening <?
[12:55:46] <kborchers> jzaefferer: how does that look?
[12:56:36] <kborchers> also, that was scary. didn't look at scott's commit from this morning so when i rebased and saw a bunch of tests being deleted i was like WTF did i just do??
[12:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> haha

[14:13:13] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tests: Cleanup. - Scott González
[14:17:00] <gnarf> hrm
[14:17:15] <gnarf> seems my method for detecting top/left  vs bottom/right position is flawed
[14:26:42] <kborchers> gnarf: does this help at all? https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/aaecadf0ff211848ad1fd4f4c3314a2573c0d243#L1R519
[14:26:56] <kborchers> not exaclty sure what you're doing but remembered that position testing
[14:46:37] <jzaefferer> btw. I updated testswarm, so old results are gone, including the one scott linked to earlier
[14:46:47] <jzaefferer> but new jobs are running: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/
[15:00:37] <peol> gnarf: I guess document.styleSheets is of no use either, afaik it only contains style/link elements (and it's often huge)
[15:00:56] <gnarf> yeah, this one is buggin me
[15:01:04] <gnarf> i thought i had it with the !== "auto"
[15:03:49] <peol> gnarf: but was it only bottom?
[15:03:55] <peol> or all of 'em
[15:03:59] <gnarf> bottom and right both
[15:04:22] <gnarf> if they were equal to auto, i'm assuming element is positioned using top/left
[15:04:27] <peol> seems it's all of them
[15:04:29] <peol> yeah, exactly
[15:04:44] <gnarf> boo FF
[15:05:29] <gnarf> getComputedStyle().bottom is definately "85px" in this example instead of "auto"
[15:06:11] <gnarf> i can kinda destroy / muck the css right there too
[15:06:22] <gnarf> it gets set back very shortly to top/left regardless
[15:06:38] <gnarf> maybe check if its auto, if not, set it to auto and read it again, compare?
[15:09:04] <gnarf> el.css("bottom") !== "auto" || ( el.css("bottom") !== el.css("bottom", "auto").css("bottom") )
[15:09:40] <peol> i doubt that, it seems firefox is doing the 'right' thing here and giving you the computed value, no matter what
[15:10:49] <peol> or maybe i just misunderstood you
[15:10:59] <gnarf> el.css("bottom") !== "auto" && ( el.css("bottom") !== el.css("bottom", "auto").css("bottom") )
[15:12:37] <gnarf> wait
[15:12:52] <gnarf> isn't there a method in core that lets me set a value to something else and sets it back automatically?
[15:12:53] <peol> gnarf: or perhaps just create a pseudo element, width/height 0 and position it with the left/right values and compare
[15:13:11] <gnarf> hrm
[15:13:50] <gnarf> not bad
[15:14:09] <gnarf> but if the computed values are all correct
[15:14:14] <gnarf> the left/right will be correct
[15:14:15] <gnarf> right/
[15:14:56] <peol> yeah
[15:15:28] <peol> you'd probably have to check left/top individually though
[15:15:53] <gnarf> ?swap
[15:16:02] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/swap
[15:16:03] <peol> bot-t has been down all day
[15:16:13] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.swap
[15:16:16] <gnarf> undoced
[15:16:19] <gnarf> but exists
[15:17:08] <gnarf> no useful return tho
[15:17:16] <gnarf> lame
[15:22:17] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/5a188b39c795024f6d3d seems to work
[15:22:50] <gnarf> ugly
[15:22:53] <gnarf> but seems to work
[15:26:53] <peol> Looks pretty OK, but won't the element potentially flicker if you play around with those properties?
[15:27:18] <gnarf> yes
[15:27:44] <gnarf> haven't seen it yet tho
[15:28:47] <gnarf> even on "fixed"
[15:29:00] <gnarf> where the flicker should be very obvious
[15:29:16] <peol> nah, i think perhaps a check in $.support for 'auto' should be added, and use that here
[15:29:24] <peol> FF is pretty quick compared to older IE
[15:29:29] <gnarf> yeah
[15:29:33] <gnarf> know what you're sayin
[15:29:47] <gnarf> i suppose i could drop my own flag on support
[15:29:53] <gnarf> in this effect
[15:31:11] <gnarf> $.support.computedAuto = ....
[15:31:31] <gnarf> just seems kinda gay to feature test for like one effect tho :)
[15:31:59] <peol> yeah, but it's better than running it in all browsers imo
[15:32:06] <gnarf> agree
[15:34:03] <gnarf> ooo
[15:34:47] <gnarf> what if i made $.effects.usesPosition = function
[15:35:00] <gnarf> rather than setting the flag
[15:35:17] <gnarf> just have two funcs, one for people who return "auto" and then this one for FF
[15:40:43] <peol> would be a bit larger, but might be worth it
[15:40:57] <peol> with the downside that no one can feature detect that except doing it manually
[15:41:25] <gnarf> i suppose
[15:41:36] <gnarf> I'm wondering now if this is needed in effects.core
[15:41:50] <gnarf> so far scale is the only thing I've cared about
[15:42:01] <gnarf> as its really the only effect that can end up with the top/left being different
[15:42:28] <gnarf> everything else is basically a show/hide toggle or leaves the position the same
[15:46:34] <gnarf> or, i could make it set the prob on a vis: hidden clone
[15:54:02] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/5a188b39c795024f6d3d thats kinda where I'm at now
[15:57:20] <gnarf> ajpiano: why does that function put a horrible taste in my mouth?
[15:57:27] <gnarf> :)
[16:04:18] <gnarf> i'm not sure i need the clone to happen anymore
[16:10:55] <ajpiano> gnarf: probz cause it tastes bad
[16:10:57] <ajpiano> :p
[16:11:15] <gnarf> i can't think of a better way around it
[16:11:36] <gnarf> not sure how to handle the feature test either, since i need to be able to append to body
[16:21:35] <peol> gnarf: you can create a fake body, like jQuery does
[16:22:14] <peol> or, i thought they implemented that at least
[16:22:40] <gnarf> seems they do
[16:24:20] <gnarf> not sure it would work on this one
[16:25:53] <gnarf> thats quite a bit of code to do
[16:26:01] <gnarf> compared to just letting it run on doc ready
[16:47:07] <gnarf> hey scott_gonzalez, wb - got a chance to give an opinion on something?
[16:47:16] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/5a188b39c795024f6d3d
[16:47:38] <gnarf> its ugly as shit, but I can't come up with any other way to detect that
[16:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[16:54:51] <scott_gonzalez> checkPositioning( $( "<div id=letsBreakShit>" )[0], "top" )
[16:55:50] <scott_gonzalez> or even worse, styles based on relative position, e.g., div ~ div
[16:57:18] <gnarf> I can't seem to coerce FF into giving me "auto" for that either
[16:58:18] <gnarf> its the root of the 12 fails in the effects suite
[17:01:30] <gnarf> i could do it without the clone too
[17:01:35] <gnarf> and just hope it doesn't flash
[17:01:43] <gnarf> i never saw it flash in my testing
[17:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok, we can probably do this for tests
[17:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> since we have complete control over what's going on
[17:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> we couldn't do something like that inside of actual code though
[17:09:22] <gnarf> well, then that bug is unfixable
[17:09:33] <gnarf> at least as far as i can tell
[17:12:12] <gnarf> might as well throw out those unit tests and all that math if we can't reliably tell if its positioned from bottom or right
[17:13:13] <gnarf> if you use my scale visual test, set it to bottom / right positioned with a top/left origin you'll see the bug
[17:16:21] <gnarf> the final position needs to be recalculated
[17:16:25] <gnarf> otherwise it "jumps"
[17:17:45] <gnarf> Short of complaining on the mozilla tracker about the inconsistency, I don't think that will ever be "fixed"
[17:18:02] <gnarf> even then, i doubt they'd fix it
[17:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, there's definitely no way to detect "auto" right now
[17:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> which caused us to change the API for accordion :-/
[17:18:57] <gnarf> i'm not even really trying to detect auto, i just want to know if the "bottom" is where it got its position
[17:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> well, we can't detect that reliably since there can be any number of CSS rules that wont' get applied to the clone
[17:23:17] <gnarf> or we avoid using the clone and just set bottom to auto
[17:23:22] <gnarf> and see if its the same
[17:23:37] <gnarf> may cause a "flash" but its set back like 1 op later
[17:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> but you can't set it back properly
[17:25:30] <gnarf> i just stored its "old" value
[17:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> which is going to be the computed value
[17:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> which is the whole reason you're doing this, right?
[17:25:58] <gnarf> which is all we have anyway
[17:26:11] <gnarf> the reason i need it
[17:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> right, but if it's auto and you get a computed value, setting it back to the computed value is wrong
[17:26:25] <gnarf> is cuz at the end of the effect, i can't just "restore" i need to calculate a new position
[17:26:41] <gnarf> and i want to use the same position properties they were using
[17:27:27] <gnarf> the effect itself wraps it in a container anyway
[17:27:35] <gnarf> and does all sorts of other messy math
[17:27:40] <gnarf> the computed value is good enough
[17:28:07] <scott_gonzalez> but at the end of the animation, the element will have the computed value, right?
[17:28:36] <gnarf> computed value +/- changes during the anim
[17:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> do you have a demo of this?
[17:29:41] <gnarf> yeah, /tests/visual/effects/effects.scale.html
[17:30:02] <gnarf> use positioning bottom/right
[17:32:42] <gnarf> compare FF to chrome
[17:32:48] <gnarf> FF is bugged
[17:32:53] <gnarf> its the "jump" at the end
[17:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> where is "auto" being used?
[17:35:07] <gnarf> its only being used to "detect" that bottom position is not being used
[17:35:48] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.effects.scale.js#L121-122
[17:35:53] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see a jump at the end
[17:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> FF and Chrome look the same
[17:37:06] <gnarf> on FF, if the element is positioned using "top" that returns "bottom"
[17:37:29] <gnarf> and sry, you wanna test in top/left
[17:37:36] <gnarf> and wtf
[17:37:41] <gnarf> this was totally buggy earlier
[17:38:04] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[17:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I don't see a jump with top left either
[17:39:17] * gnarf hunts some more
[17:39:25] <gnarf> maybe it is just an error in the test
[17:39:47] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[17:40:25] <gnarf> try top/left/bottom/right
[17:40:38] <gnarf> config #9 on the visual test
[17:41:05] <gnarf> there should be a visible jump post animation on FF that doesn't exist on chrome
[17:41:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[17:41:47] <gnarf> that is the bug
[17:42:14] <gnarf> and its because my math things it was initially positioned using bottom
[17:42:30] <gnarf> and plugging in that function solved it
[17:42:37] <gnarf> (which is why i couldn't repro it a second ago)
[17:43:51] <gnarf> using checkPositioning( "bottom" ) ? "bottom" : "top"
[17:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> what if it's positioned by both?
[17:45:39] <gnarf> can it be?
[17:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[17:45:51] <gnarf> well ain't that a bitch
[17:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> it's actually a really nice way to make an element expand
[17:45:58] <gnarf> that makes no sense
[17:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> you could do: { position: absolute; top: 10px; right: 10px; bottom: 10px; left: 10px; }
[17:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> and the element would always look like { margin: 10px; }
[17:46:54] <scott_gonzalez> within its parent
[17:46:58] * gnarf grumbles
[17:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> it's actually kinda awesome :-)
[17:47:12] <gnarf> so which of those should I change after scale?
[17:47:16] <gnarf> all of them
[17:47:20] <gnarf> i guess
[17:47:24] <kborchers> wow, i actually had no idea you could do that (from the peanut gallery)
[17:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I was amazed when a co-worker showed it to me a few years ago
[17:48:21] <kborchers> the things you learn while lurking ;)
[17:48:32] <gnarf> i assume one of top/bottom/height must be auto then
[17:48:40] <gnarf> what wins when you define all three
[17:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> I had written a bunch of JavaScript to do something crazy that the designer had asked me to implement
[17:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> and after I had it working, he was like, "umm...just set all the properties"
[17:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...no sure which wins in that scenario
[17:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> probably whatever property is specified last
[17:50:02] <scott_gonzalez> brb, bed time for the kids
[17:50:28] <gnarf> i just don't want to set a property that wasn't set before
[17:51:17] <gnarf> and i don't know how to avoid that either
[17:51:19] <gnarf> god damnit
[17:51:33] * gnarf votes to remove this whole damn effect
[17:51:36] <gnarf> :)
[17:51:39] <kborchers> heh
[17:51:41] <gnarf> i know scott_gonzalez has said that before
[18:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> back
[18:07:22] <gnarf> this is only a problem when not using show/hide mode
[18:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[18:08:06] <gnarf> cuz on show/hide you can just restore the original props
[18:16:01] <gnarf> i dunno what to do w/ this one

[18:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> I dunno either
[18:16:53] <scott_gonzalez> other than petition Firefox to change
[18:17:02] <gnarf> im about to
[18:20:30] <gnarf> it seems to me that FF is the one following the spec though
[18:26:12] <gnarf> it just seems that the whole positional recalcuation is just a bad idea tho
[18:26:32] <gnarf> especially considering what you just told me about top/left

[20:17:45] <gnarf> hrm
[20:17:59] <gnarf> i just ran into a merge conflict trying to bring this over to 1-8-stable
[20:18:29] <gnarf> seems 1-8-stable is using .filter( ":last" ) instead of .last()
[20:18:46] <gnarf> oh
[20:18:50] <gnarf> nvm
[20:18:56] <gnarf> thats needed for 1.3 support right?
