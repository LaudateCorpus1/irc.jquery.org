[01:36:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Got it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/vmouse.js#L51-L57
[06:35:41] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I can't remember what happened with the .bind() -> .on() change for UI. Looks like we never got around to doing it?
[06:56:22] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah i had a branch i never submitted because it was not worth it
[06:56:42] <scott_gonzalez> Why not?
[06:56:43] <arschmitz> but then we decided to drop 1.6
[06:56:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, ok
[06:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> So can you get it up to date and send an PR?
[06:57:04] <arschmitz> and i still have not got around to digging that back up
[06:57:11] <arschmitz> yup
[06:57:16] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[06:57:20] <arschmitz> no problem
[06:58:11] <arschmitz> yeah we should have that in 1.12
[06:58:32] <arschmitz> since it drops code and dependency
[07:00:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so any thoughts on this whole nested option insanity since we can't just use it as is and support camelcasing
[07:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> Honestly, I'd say add new options if you really want to support it.
[07:02:43] <scott_gonzalez> Attributes for complex settings are never going to be that nice.
[07:03:14] <arschmitz> "add new options" what do you mean ?
[07:04:20] <arschmitz> do you mean like try to avoid nesting and add a new top level option?
[07:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> uiButtonClass="foo"
[07:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> Which gets converted to classes.ui-button
[07:06:10] <arschmitz> hm ok
[07:07:40] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: honestly i think i might ignore this until we have a request we dont really have any options like this other then classes for the most part
[07:08:11] <arschmitz> its only ever been team members that brought it up and in the hypothetical
[07:08:38] <arschmitz> classes is the first place its come up
[07:08:47] <arschmitz> for real
[07:09:45] <arschmitz> and unless we get a lot of requests we can just say do data-ui-classes="{'ui-button': 'foo'}"
