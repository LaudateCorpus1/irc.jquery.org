[05:19:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: morning
[05:19:37] <b-ot> arschmitz: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[05:19:47] <arschmitz> `read
[05:19:47] <b-ot> arschmitz: From uGoMobi, 21h 29m ago: : I think you mentioned to me that you wanted to merge this PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6180#issuecomment-22072686 (CLA has been signed)
[05:20:01] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:20:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so for ^^ yes i want to merge that
[05:21:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok great
[05:21:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how was your weekend?
[05:21:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and for pages no it should automaticly create a page if none is present and ajax nav is enabled
[05:22:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good didnt get quite as much done as i would have liked but you never do on the weekends i dont think
[05:22:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: how was yours?
[05:23:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was good, we have nice wheather these days :)
[05:23:20] <arschmitz> yeah its nice here too
[05:23:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah so if AJAX is disabed we don't create a page if none is present?
[05:24:01] <arschmitz> well nav as a whole but yeah
[05:24:18] <uGoMobi> ok, makes sense
[05:24:25] <arschmitz> have to make sure if we are suposed to be dealing with pages that one exists
[05:24:38] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[05:25:03] <uGoMobi> I was more thinking about when you just want to use a widget in a html doc
[05:25:17] <uGoMobi> but in that case you won't use navigation
[05:25:23] <arschmitz> exactly
[05:25:34] <uGoMobi> I will add another comment on that issue
[05:25:39] <arschmitz> realy in that case you should use a custom build as well
[05:26:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: autoinit is merged
[05:27:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw the commit, awesome!
[05:27:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well kinda....
[05:27:36] <arschmitz> there is a 100% consistant failure on travis
[05:27:42] <arschmitz> that does not happen local
[05:27:49] <arschmitz> for me anyway
[05:28:07] <uGoMobi> a specific test?
[05:29:10] <arschmitz> yes
[05:29:31] <arschmitz> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/9847590
[05:29:37] <arschmitz> every jquery version
[05:30:09] <arschmitz> all about first last classes
[05:30:11] <uGoMobi> ah I see
[05:30:30] <arschmitz> but both browser and command line i dont get any errors
[05:30:44] <arschmitz> so it will probably be a challenge to figure out
[05:30:56] <uGoMobi> that's very weird
[05:31:07] <arschmitz> yeah frustrating
[05:31:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so iv been looking at that super old ruby on rails checkbox issue
[05:31:55] <uGoMobi> ah that one
[05:32:10] <arschmitz> pretty sure i can fix that in like 1 or 2 lines
[05:32:17] <uGoMobi> nice
[05:32:30] <uGoMobi> to me it wasn't clear where ruby puts that hidden input
[05:32:32] <arschmitz> just have it end up where the checkbox is in the dom instead of the label
[05:32:40] <arschmitz> because issue is checkbox is moved to label
[05:32:48] <arschmitz> instead have label move to the checkbox
[05:32:51] <uGoMobi> yeah we do some dom manip
[05:33:19] <arschmitz> should be pretty minor im going to take a look today
[05:33:26] <uGoMobi> ok great
[05:33:54] <arschmitz> be good to get that fixed will please all the rubyists 
[05:34:13] <uGoMobi> we want to double check if all 3 possible label positions still work
[05:34:21] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:34:26] <uGoMobi> before input, after and wrapped around
[05:34:44] <uGoMobi> i remember Gabriel had some issues with that before
[05:34:46] <arschmitz> the end dom should be the same as it is now just in the location where the checkbox originally was instead of where label was
[05:34:50] <uGoMobi> had to do with controlgroup
[05:35:12] <uGoMobi> actually, I think it was when we were adding firstlastclasses.js :)
[05:35:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so like now iif it goes label ->hidden ->checkbox the end is label->checkbox->hidden i will just make it hidden->label-> checkbox
[05:36:14] <arschmitz> so the "visible" dom will not change
[05:37:33] <uGoMobi> yeah sounds good 
[05:38:22] <uGoMobi> just want to be sure it still works as expected when they are in controlgroups
[05:38:43] <arschmitz> yeah it shouldnt make a difference but obviously will check
[06:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Do you happen to know if http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9476 is caused by https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/959/files
[06:03:00] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #959 by croensch (3mon 2w ago): checkbox() not initializing in Internet Explorers normal mode.
[06:04:38] <tj_vantoll> Nah, this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/959/files is for the dormant formcontrols branch.
[06:04:39] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: Pull request #959 by croensch (3mon 2w ago): checkbox() not initializing in Internet Explorers normal mode.
[06:07:07] <tj_vantoll> Huh #9476 seems bad.
[06:12:02] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: It's a duplicate of #8443.
[06:12:37] <tj_vantoll> The demos work fine when not in an <iframe> in IE9. In an <iframe> you get the unspecified error about document.activeElement.
[06:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[06:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll look into implementing something like the core fix you found.
[06:13:40] <tj_vantoll> Sounds good.
[07:00:43] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[07:05:20] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[07:05:57] <frequent> uGoMobi: I was travelling on the weekend. I will try to fix my issues tonight
[07:06:08] <frequent> uGoMobi: question:
[07:06:22] <uGoMobi> frequent: awesome
[07:06:32] <frequent> is there a latest compiled version with all current changes?
[07:06:35] <uGoMobi> frequent: we have a few more days though
[07:06:43] <frequent> ok
[07:06:48] <uGoMobi> frequent: yes
[07:06:56] <frequent> where?
[07:07:05] <uGoMobi> frequent: http://jsbin.com/edeluh/1/edit
[07:07:18] <uGoMobi> the links in our JS Bin template point to a build
[07:07:52] <frequent> uGoMobi: perfect
[07:08:20] <frequent> uGoMobi: off of your head, has anyone filed/fixed ui-overlay-x missing in popup?
[07:08:48] <uGoMobi> frequent: no, but I do remember I made some changes there
[07:08:51] <frequent> = on my (not latest) version, the popup-screen element does not get the overlay class
[07:09:02] <frequent> ok
[07:09:08] <frequent> will try with the latest.
[07:09:09] <frequent> thx
[07:10:05] <uGoMobi> frequent: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/popup/ here it works
[07:10:26] <uGoMobi> see demos in section "theme" on that page
[07:10:36] <frequent> uGoMobi: saw that, but did not know which version that was using
[07:10:51] <uGoMobi> frequent: that's also latest code, but not a build
[07:11:55] <uGoMobi> so it's same code, just bit slower, and the file order is still a bit different
[07:12:55] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. I see. Thx
[07:51:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmmm i was just thinking about tests. i bet it would help if when we go throguh and change all calls to create to enhanceWithin
[07:52:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, makes sense to update that
[07:52:40] <arschmitz> will also mean a lot of tests can become unit vs integration
[07:52:53] <arschmitz> because that makes them totally sync
[07:53:07] <uGoMobi> right, we can move them back :)
[07:53:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well we wont have a choice to update at somepoint once i remove create backcompat binding in 1.5 lol
[07:54:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just checking the changelog. I think we forget to mention that we deprecate that
[07:54:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah because it just got deprecated last night :)
[07:55:01] <arschmitz> it was not in first alpha because there was no alternative
[07:55:17] <uGoMobi> ah that's right
[07:55:48] <arschmitz> im going to make a commit to deprecate the other stuff we talked about before today and then add all of it to change log
[07:56:09] <uGoMobi> great!
[07:56:45] <arschmitz> there is SOOOOO much backcompat in 1.4 lol 
[08:01:25] <frequent> uGoMobi: arschmitz: have you considered making the JQM "test environment" a feature?
[08:01:27] <frequent> uGoMobi: arschmitz: I hacked the 1.3.2 version a little bit to allow to load/require my application and then write my application tests inside the environment.
[08:01:28] <frequent> uGoMobi: arschmitz: of course one would have to use requirejs, but then I think it's quite handy. 
[08:01:55] <arschmitz> frequent: not sure i follow?
[08:02:53] <frequent> arschmitz: if you have an application that uses JQM and requirejs and want to write unit tests...
[08:03:06] <frequent> arschmitz: why not use the JQM test environment
[08:03:13] <frequent> arschmitz: to test your application
[08:03:26] <arschmitz> frequent: you can all you do is copy it into your application and adjust paths and add your tests
[08:03:47] <frequent> arschmitz: I modified it so, JQM is loaded out of the box and the testHelper requests the application ...
[08:03:55] <frequent> and the test-lib
[08:04:16] <frequent> and then I can simulate a user going through the application
[08:04:18] <frequent> more or less
[08:04:21] <arschmitz> you mean to use like whole compiled lib instead of pieces with require
[08:04:52] <frequent> arschmitz: yup. I load the complied lib upfront (along with everything else I need) and then test my application (not JQM)
[08:05:09] <arschmitz> frequent: yeah that kinda outside out scope 
[08:05:31] <frequent> true, but handy
[08:05:35] <arschmitz> we really dont do anything special we just use qunit with some helpers
[08:05:42] <arschmitz> so you could easily do same
[08:06:32] <frequent> arschmitz: hm. guess it depends on how familiar one is with qunit.
[08:07:02] <frequent> arschmitz: ok. was just an idea.
[08:15:03] <arschmitz> frequent: documentation on test helpers we have would be a good idea though
[08:16:47] <frequent> arschmitz: good point

[09:03:33] <uGoMobi> I hope the solution is indeed that simple

[09:03:56] <uGoMobi> data-hidedividers="true"
[09:04:16] <uGoMobi> we set that to false by default
[09:04:52] <frequent> uGoMobi: ah...
[09:05:03] <frequent> did not know
[09:05:09] <uGoMobi> neither did I
[09:05:15] <frequent> lol
[09:05:24] <uGoMobi> I know _|Nix|_ made some changes
[09:05:27] <frequent> "hidden features of JQM"
[09:05:37] <uGoMobi> anyways, +1 to set the default to true
[09:05:44] <frequent> yup
[09:06:52] <frequent> uGoMobi: to make things complicated... we would also have <optgroup>s in select... 
[09:07:09] <frequent> I never used it, so I will make an example to see what happens.

[10:23:18] <gseguin> gnarf: thanks!
[10:23:31] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: did you see that: http://www.quora.com/jQuery-UI/Why-is-jQuery-UI-so-ugly ?
[10:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> I hate quora.
[10:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> What does Paul's comment say?
[10:32:46] <tj_vantoll> I hate it as well.
[10:32:46] <tj_vantoll> I couldn't have said it much better than Brian. Back in 2008, we did a heavy, mostly internal API redesign and with that move, also ironed out a solid class-based styling architecture to allow you to create any theme you want.
[10:32:46] <tj_vantoll> The ThemeRoller was a way to showcase this, but in no means an attempt to deliver the best themes for jQuery UI – in fact, if you download a ThemeRoller generated package, you also get the source versions to freely modify the theme, so it's more of a blueprint. I can't speak for the rest of the team back then, but I always felt the wish for a heterogenous web running jQuery UI with custom designed themes for custom websites, and not one theme to rul
[10:32:46] <tj_vantoll> Lust but not least, design your own theme and release it!
[10:33:11] <godswearhats> What is quora again? The name sounds familiar?
[10:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> heh, "a heterogenous web"
[10:36:54] <godswearhats> Uh ...
[10:39:44] <gseguin> uGoMobi: the git build is fixed

[11:27:13] <godswearhats> It's not clear to a n00b :-)
[12:04:37] <arschmitz> godswearhats: i would skip that one its more a dev task then a bug and the panels are being worked on currently and any changes of that nature will be a part of that work
[12:06:22] <godswearhats> OK then.
