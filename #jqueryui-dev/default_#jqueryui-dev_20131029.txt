[05:23:53] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, hey TJ, I am reviewing datepicker wiki and adding comments on what regards to globalization stuff, ok. Just added one :)
[05:24:09] <rxaviers> doubt, what is defaultDate for?
[05:24:15] <rxaviers> question*
[05:29:26] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: A date to highlight when the calendar is opened http://jsfiddle.net/ynA5n/
[05:31:02] <tj_vantoll> Also thanks for looking at the Wiki, reading your comment now.
[05:31:26] <rxaviers> Gotcha
[05:32:11] <tj_vantoll> So essentially it seems that "dayNames" and "monthNames" can go away because users will have the ability to configure those through locales in Globalize. Did I understand that correctly?

[06:13:03] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, do you guys use dot '.' as date separator? http://i18ndata.appspot.com/cldr/main/de/dates/calendars/gregorian/dateFormats/short?action=browse&depth=3
[06:25:18] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, what's navigationAsDateFormat for?
[06:25:40] <rxaviers> / True if date formatting applied to prev/today/next links
[06:27:01] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, is numberOfMonths the concurrent months that are displayed in the popover?
[06:27:36] <tj_vantoll> Yes to your second question.
[06:28:31] <tj_vantoll> navigationAsDateFormat is such a confusing API, hold on I'll get an example.
[06:29:57] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/rdk2C/ Note the title attributes of the previous and next links.
[06:30:27] <tj_vantoll> Revisiting this I really think that we should just make sure that option can handled as an extension point.
[06:30:48] <tj_vantoll> _buildPreviousButton(), _buildNextButton()
[06:31:39] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: +1 i think thats a good idea
[06:32:18] <tj_vantoll> cool
[06:32:44] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers You're just commenting not editing the page correct? (Want to make sure we're not editing at the same time)
[06:32:49] <rxaviers> ah, gotcha what the prev was for given your solution :)
[06:32:58] <rxaviers> correct
[06:33:09] <tj_vantoll> ok
[06:39:20] <rxaviers> Much better implementing this as an extension point.
[06:39:39] <rxaviers> (also thanks for the example)
[06:41:04] <tj_vantoll> np
[06:48:12] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, how  does eachDay work (also in relation with selectOtherMonths)?
[06:49:10] <rxaviers> Does datepicker use this.date.eachDay, or it's used internally by this.date?
[06:50:35] <tj_vantoll> It's an API that hasn't totally been fleshed out yet.
[06:51:06] <tj_vantoll> But the idea is that it would be a saner version of what is currently the "beforeShowDay" option.
[06:51:20] <tj_vantoll> A function called for each day before it is displayed.
[06:51:38] <tj_vantoll> The main purpose would be to disable individual days.
[06:52:58] <tj_vantoll> eachDay: function( date ) {
[06:52:58] <tj_vantoll>     return date == "1 / 2 / 3"; 
[06:52:58] <tj_vantoll> }

[06:54:01] <tj_vantoll> So selectOtherMonths could be handled by disabling dates in the new eachDay option.
[06:57:10] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez, tj_vantoll: just wanted to get your opinion on test generators in the test suite: http://git.io/B8RfGg
[06:58:18] <scott_gonzalez> They're fine. We use them in other places too.
[06:58:42] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/accordion/accordion_core.js#L8-L21
[06:59:06] <tj_vantoll> Something about them doesn't work in phantom though?
[07:00:01] <mikesherov> tj_vantoll: no, the fixed tests had some commented out code for phantomJS
[07:00:08] <tj_vantoll> That approach is quite clever.
[07:00:10] <tj_vantoll> ah
[07:00:18] <mikesherov> so the generator removes those caveats, so I have to skip them in PhantomJS
[07:00:33] <mikesherov> OK, so I'm going to land that
[07:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> +1
[07:00:43] <mikesherov> I'm super close to a fix for 9379
[07:00:51] <mikesherov> scroll IS FUN
[07:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> Not a huge fan of i, j, k, l, m, but it's an improvement :-)
[07:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh good, you and your soon-to-be-new-best-friend can have a blast working on the interactions :-)
[07:04:42] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: what do you prefer in place of single char incrementor variables?
[07:04:58] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, I understood what selectOtherMonths was for, but I didnt understand how eachDay will replace it? (is it?)
[07:07:04] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Maybe just more descriptive names like helperIndex, positionIndex, etc. When you get past j, it just always seems error prone to me.
[07:07:04] <rxaviers> (is it going to replace it?)*
[07:07:25] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: fair enough
[07:07:26] <mikesherov> I'll update
[07:07:41] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: Sorry, just got in a meeting.
[07:07:50] <rxaviers> ah sure np
[07:08:09] <rxaviers> if you are busy now, I am also going to leave and brb in 1h
[07:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: selectOtherMonths is for whether or not the days that fall outside the current month are selectable.

[07:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> eachDay is for whether each specific day is selectable.e

[07:11:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[07:11:11] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: yeah, exactly. For example, today its 29.10.2013
[07:11:29] <rxaviers> (ah! so you use dot ".", cool)
[07:11:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hyunsook's https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/190 reminded me of that  ...
[07:11:33] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Pull request #190 by hyunsook (5h 59m ago): Entries and resources: Listview: Fixed a description and example regarding the listviewbeforefilter of listview on 1-4 branch. And additionally, fixed the theme D using in example16.
[07:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I haven't looked at the code in a while, but if eachDay is replacing beforeShowDay, then what I said is at least the intention, even if not the current implementation :-)
[07:11:49] <rxaviers> ;)
[07:13:32] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: I'm not sure how well eachDay is actually implemented in the current code.
[07:14:01] <tj_vantoll> It's one of those things that we need to finalize exactly what we want it to do first.
[07:14:18] <tj_vantoll> So it's probably not worth looking at the current code.
[07:15:14] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, jzaefferer, can I enter this discussion :)
[07:15:16] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: the return value of eachDay is irrelevant, the input has to be read and modified; demos/other-months.html has an usage example
[07:15:51] <jzaefferer> if anyone has a better idea, we can change it
[07:15:59] <jzaefferer> its certainly better then the API it replaces
[07:16:38] <rxaviers> So, is  idea to let user to provide its own eachDay map?
[07:16:42] <rxaviers> is the* idea
[07:16:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so this means people have to use filterablebeforefilter?
[07:17:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I believe so, although we've promised the old behaviour would still be there. I simply forgot to also trigger listviewbeforefilter.
[07:17:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, can happen
[07:17:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont think that is major enough to be a concern at this point we can fix that in 1.4.1
[07:17:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just writing a quick jsbin to test ...
[07:17:56] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/datepicker/demos/datepicker/other-months.html#L19
[07:18:07] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: yeah
[07:18:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I agree
[07:18:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ : it's not like you can make your code work anymore
[07:18:52] <rxaviers> ok
[07:19:09] <rxaviers> and it seems you are still discussion whether or not to remove or preserve a bunch of other options that could be replaced by eachDay logic, right?
[07:19:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: OK. I'll make an issue and milestone it for 1.4.1.
[07:19:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ : we can do a 1.4.1 ~ 3 weeks after 1.4.0
[07:19:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sounds good
[07:19:48] <_|Nix|_> Sweet ...
[07:20:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am not sure about that iOS panel dies when scrolling fast issue
[07:21:04] <uGoMobi> that might be something we have to fix if we can
[07:21:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i need to figure out whats going on there
[07:21:26] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: not eachDay specifically. The goal is to simplify the API, while being more flexible
[07:25:23] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I see comments on wiki about questioning whether to replace or not some options in favor of eachDay, eg: beforeShowDay, defaultDate, selectOtherMonths, and showOtherMonths. It would be nice to have examples of how each option would have to be written in eachDay-way for comparison (if this isn't already done).
[07:26:03] * rxaviers brb in 30-40mins (got have a lunch now hehe)
[07:26:17] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: good point, yeah, those examples would be useful; for selectOtherMonths, the demo I linked to has that

[10:43:43] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Im discussing some documentation interpretations, and Im willing a second opinion.
[10:43:44] <rxaviers> This:
[10:43:46] <rxaviers> "h Hour [1-12]. When used in skeleton data or in a skeleton passed in an API for flexible date pattern generation, it should match the 12-hour-cycle format preferred by the locale (h or K); it should not match a 24-hour-cycle format (H or k). Use hh for zero padding."
[10:44:03] <rxaviers> Makes you think h should be interpreted as K in a special occasion?
[10:44:38] <rxaviers> (willing to have* a second opinion)
[10:48:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it is a swipe issue. when setting option swipe to close it does not happen.
[10:49:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: still strange that you can't open the panel anymore
[10:50:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmmm the person in the issue says the oppisit
[10:50:58] <arschmitz> that setting swipe to false did not fix that only setting animation to none fixed

[11:01:22] <rxaviers> uGoMobi, arschmitz, guys since you are online, if you have a couple of mins, I am looking for a second opinion interpreting this line:
[11:01:30] <rxaviers> "h Hour [1-12]. When used in skeleton data or in a skeleton passed in an API for flexible date pattern generation, it should match the 12-hour-cycle format preferred by the locale (h or K); it should not match a 24-hour-cycle format (H or k). Use hh for zero padding."

[11:06:20] <arschmitz> rxaviers: if i recall its determined by whatever the local format is ( h or k ) which is used like what its been set to
[11:07:01] <arschmitz> for unicode formating so i assume this would be the same 
[11:09:27] <rxaviers> My confusion (reading that sentence) is: should a skeleton data/format `h` be interpret as `K` (if K is the preferred format for that locale); or a skeleton data/format should never be defined using `h`, but using `K`?

[11:09:38] <rxaviers> interpreted*
[11:09:48] <uGoMobi> rxaviers: also... Hour [0-11]. When used in a skeleton, only matches K or h, see above. Use KK for zero padding.
[11:10:09] <uGoMobi> so 10 can be interpreted as K or h
[11:12:11] <arschmitz> and which one it will be interpreted as is determined by the locale
[11:12:24] <uGoMobi> right
[11:12:43] <arschmitz> rxaviers: does that help?
[11:13:07] <rxaviers> So, let's say a skeleton x is equal to the format "h"
[11:13:14] <rxaviers> Now is 10am
[11:13:39] <rxaviers> If my local preferred format is h, it would result in 9
[11:13:47] <rxaviers> ops 10
[11:13:59] <rxaviers> If my local preferred format is K, it would result in 9
[11:14:05] <rxaviers> is that correct?
[11:14:22] <rxaviers> So, "h" is interpreted as K in that last case?
[11:16:58] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yes i think so
[11:17:14] <rxaviers> that's the point
[11:17:25] <rxaviers> "h" format should always be interpret as [0-11]
[11:17:39] <rxaviers> ops
[11:17:48] <rxaviers> "h" format should always be interpreted as [1-12]
[11:17:50] <uGoMobi> 1-12
[11:17:54] <rxaviers> "K" format should always be interpreted as [0-11]
[11:18:16] <rxaviers> What that sentence is supposed to mean is that you that creates skeleton data should not use them depending of your locale. Eg
[11:18:23] <rxaviers> - main.en.dates.calendars.gregorian.dateTimeFormats.availableFormats.h = "h a";
[11:18:23] <rxaviers> - main.jp.dates.calendars.gregorian.dateTimeFormats.availableFormats.h = "aK時";
[11:19:26] <arschmitz> rxaviers: oh i see yes and that is what it says
[11:19:32] <arschmitz> i was overthinking it i think
[11:19:38] <rxaviers> yeap, me too.
[11:19:49] <rxaviers> After the guy from unicode tell me that, it gets clearer.
[11:20:07] <rxaviers> But, at first instance I was really confused.
[11:20:09] <rxaviers> :D
[11:20:20] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yeah and it says exactly what its supposed to 
[11:20:24] <rxaviers> does it
[11:20:26] <rxaviers> ok cool
[11:20:37] <arschmitz> its just i didnt think about it properly
[11:20:56] <rxaviers> good to know then
[11:20:58] <rxaviers> ;)
[11:21:00] <rxaviers> thank you guys
[11:21:06] <arschmitz> rxaviers: no problem\
[11:30:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think i figured it out
[11:31:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what do you think it is?
[11:31:34] <arschmitz> its the animation 
[11:31:49] <arschmitz> when it happens the complete function is never called
[11:32:07] <arschmitz> so the animation is never ending
[11:32:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think its because ios blocks js execution while scrolling
[11:32:43] <arschmitz> and the animatecomplete event is being triggered while scrolling is happening
[11:32:57] <arschmitz> so the script never recieves it
[11:33:01] <uGoMobi> I see
[11:33:34] <uGoMobi> but the problem starts with the iOS swipe issue
[11:34:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: kinda that is no different then its ever been that swipeleft / swiperight can be triggered when you scroll at an angle
[11:35:00] <uGoMobi> true
[11:36:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think the only way to solve this is to but a setTimeout as a backup to call complete if it has not already been called after a set time
[11:36:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was thinking the same
[11:37:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think that can wait for 1.4.1 people can either set animate to false or swipe to false until then
[11:39:38] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Sorry, was on a call.
[11:39:42] <scott_gonzalez> It does sound like that.
[11:39:49] <scott_gonzalez> Got a link to the page explaining it?
[11:41:57] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: im not sure but i think its just the unicode date format its quoted exactly here http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-25.html#Date_Format_Patterns
[11:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, do we know what a skeleton is?
[11:52:45] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Np, now it was me (went grab something to eat) 
[11:52:49] <rxaviers> Skeleton is defined here  http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#dateTimeFormats
[11:53:12] <fnagel> jzaefferer: ping
[11:53:18] <jzaefferer> fnagel: pon
[11:53:20] <jzaefferer> g
[11:53:24] <jzaefferer> :/
[11:53:50] <fnagel> on your wiki comment: phone or skype? I dont really get it
[11:54:08] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I think it's saying if you're matching a skeleton to a known date format, you can treat h and K the same for matching.
[11:54:34] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know when you would be matching date formats like that though.
[11:54:47] <rxaviers> yeap that's what I thought too. But, it's not true according to what Peter (from unicode) told me.
[11:55:24] <rxaviers> What that sentence is supposed to mean is that you that creates skeleton data should not use them depending of your locale. Eg
[11:55:29] <rxaviers>  - main.en.dates.calendars.gregorian.dateTimeFormats.availableFormats.h = "h a";
[11:55:29] <rxaviers>  - main.jp.dates.calendars.gregorian.dateTimeFormats.availableFormats.h = "aK時";
[11:55:41] <rxaviers> like arschmitz said, after we hear this, reading the sentence is correct.
[11:55:51] <rxaviers> Perhaps, it's not in the right place. Or, it should make it clearer
[11:57:17] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yeah i think it could be more clear
[11:57:30] <arschmitz> its correct as is but maybe not as clear as it could be

[12:08:22] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, regarding the comment here: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu#comment1382426225 - about positioned elements not updating when their container changes, which we don't support anywhere. What's our standard reply to that?
[12:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> You mean #2 in that comment?
[12:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> #1 seems legit.
[12:10:05] <scott_gonzalez> The popup should close for #2.
[12:10:24] <scott_gonzalez> I think there's actually a ticket about this with datepicker.
[12:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> And the person thinks that the datepicker should stay visible.
[12:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> But only because clicking on the text field again doesn't open the datepicker again.
[12:10:58] <scott_gonzalez> Because the text field still has focus.
[12:11:25] <scott_gonzalez> If he's resizing a containter (actually clicking on another element), then the selectmenu should definitely close.
[12:21:30] <jzaefferer> fnagel: ^^^
[12:23:32] <fnagel> Regarding #1: how to decide which CSS properties to copy to the button element? I thought wrapping the original select in a positioned div would be needed. 
[12:26:01] <fnagel> Regarding #2: Selectmenu does close when clicking an other element but by using click event, not mousedown which would be needed to cover the fiddles usecase
[12:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: What do you do in Mobile?
[12:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> If someone has a positioned <select> and it gets enhanced, how do you position the replacement correctly?
[12:27:24] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi closed issue #6670: Error with the fixed header  02http://git.io/cj1Djg
[12:27:26] <fnagel> #1 isn't covered by any widget afaik and should be "fixed" by using a positioned wrapper instead of a positioned widget base element. #2 is a very special usecase but we could cover it by using mousedown instead of click.
[12:27:27] <arschmitz> it does not
[12:28:08] <arschmitz> you have to either use a selector to select the wrapper to position it or use the wrapperClass option to add a class to the generated wrapper to do it
[12:28:18] <arschmitz> positioning the actual select will do nothing
[12:28:44] <fnagel> Another fix for #1 would be getting base element position and position the button too. Too much overhead for 95% of the usecases...
[12:29:28] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: fnagel: this can be fixed through the classes option to because then to position you can just add a class to the wrapper and position that class
[12:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so let's ignore positioned selects.
[12:30:30] <fnagel> That wont help if you need to position each instance differently, but yes, thats like a built-in wrapper option
[12:30:40] <arschmitz> fnagel: why wont it
[12:30:48] <arschmitz> add a different class to each one
[12:30:55] <fnagel> arschmitz: mhhh right, sorry
[12:31:01] <fnagel> that would work
[12:31:29] <arschmitz> i think its the only sane way to handle it
[12:31:55] <arschmitz> trying to copy styles gets to crazy
[12:32:49] <uGoMobi> note that Mobile selectmenu doesn't have option wrapperClass at the moment
[12:33:08] <fnagel> hehe
[12:34:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes i was really just speaking about anything with a wrapper that is positioned
[12:34:16] <uGoMobi> right
[12:48:19] <fnagel> So scott_gonzalez, #1 upcoming css option, use positioned wrapper for now
[12:48:32] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: what about #2
[12:49:06] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: http://jsfiddle.net/BmjAT/
[12:49:22] <mikesherov> turns out the output is the SAME in all browsers IE7 and moderner
[12:49:29] <mikesherov> moderner is a word now, by the way
[12:49:32] <scott_gonzalez> The menu should close if they mousedown outside of the menu.
[12:50:00] <scott_gonzalez> Look at autocomplete for an example (search for "one" )
[12:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> Did you test IE6 to see if there was ever any validity to the code?
[12:51:15] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: #main:absolute #scrollParent:static is the only case where an element inside a scroll:auto parent isn't the scroll parent
[12:51:21] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: autocomplete uses mousedown too so I will change this in selectmenu too
[12:51:41] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: testing IE6 now
[12:51:46] <mikesherov> because I hate life
[12:52:38] <mikesherov> word, ie6 fails to identify #main:absolute #scrollParent:static AND #main:absolute #scrollParent:fixed and that's it
[12:52:52] <mikesherov> ie6 incorrectly allows #main:fixed to pass
[12:53:06] <mikesherov> so there was, but there no longer is
[12:53:08] <mikesherov> HUZZAH
[12:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:53:24] <mikesherov> thanks for unblocking my brain

[13:21:46] <fnagel> Question to UI Widget experts: when using _on within a widget is there a way to remove a specific event? We set focusin in selectmenu and remove it after first usage but we unfortunatly removing the _focusable focusin event too. Any idea how to handle this in a proper way?
[13:22:12] <fnagel> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez:
[13:23:25] <scott_gonzalez> If you're removing it after first usage, why not just use .one()?
[13:24:01] <fnagel> we currently have one event object with all button objects, no specific reason
[13:24:18] <fnagel> I could split focusin event and use one, that should fix the issue
