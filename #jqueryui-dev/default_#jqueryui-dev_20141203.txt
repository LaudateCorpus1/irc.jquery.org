[06:02:50] <_zoggy_> hmm went to go upgade my jui 1.11.1 -> 1.11.2 and noticed that the .js and the .css say different options were selected

[08:57:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Pong! What's up?
[08:58:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: can you think of anywhere in mobile we generate complex markup that has structural classes
[08:59:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hmmm ... my only suspicion is custom select, but that's on its way out.
[08:59:09] <arschmitz> where we would be using _addClass on something that has more then 2 parents AND will later be removed
[08:59:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[08:59:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, in custom select we generate a whole dialog with header and listview.
[08:59:58] <arschmitz> yeah thats not an issue in the ui one because it calls the menu widget
[09:00:23] <arschmitz> and the selectmenu does not add its own classes to each piece of the menu it generates
[09:00:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Right, that's what we had agreed for our custom select as well. Let the child widgets do their thing.
[09:01:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i found that in all of ui there is never a place an element is tracked that has more then 2 parents 
[09:01:52] <arschmitz> which means you can do a garbage collect much much faster then using contains
[09:02:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... two parents up to html?
[09:02:17] <arschmitz> no
[09:02:19] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or up to this.element?
[09:02:39] <arschmitz> like if you just check elem.parentNode || elem.parentNode.parenNode
[09:02:47] <arschmitz> you know if its in the dom or not
[09:03:00] <gabriel_schulhof> No way ... you can't do that.
[09:03:02] <arschmitz> for anything that ever has .remove() called on it in a widget
[09:03:14] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, it could be inside a block of a grid of a collapsible.
[09:03:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that would not matter in anyway
[09:04:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What if you do $( "#my-collapsible" ).remove();
[09:04:13] <arschmitz> what about it?
[09:04:32] <arschmitz> at that point the widget factory calls destroy 
[09:04:39] <arschmitz> and everything runs normally
[09:04:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The widgets inside would get destroyed, and because they're inside grids and blocks, they'll get destroyed as if they're still in the DOM, because their parent and their grandparent are both non-null.
[09:05:24] <arschmitz> that would not matter i think you are not understanding
[09:05:42] <arschmitz> because in that case we would have been calling remove class on a detached node regardless
[09:06:05] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so what is the goal here? Is it not to avoid unnecessarily calling _removeClass()?
[09:06:19] <arschmitz> its two fold
[09:07:11] <arschmitz> mainly to never call removeclass in destroy at all
[09:07:12] <arschmitz> ever
[09:07:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: BTW: The UI meeting is going on (don't want to hold you up).
[09:07:23] <arschmitz> and also to make a simple gc method
[09:07:31] <arschmitz> im in both places
[09:07:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, just wanna make sure ...
[09:08:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. Don't _removeClass() on detached elements.
[09:08:22] <arschmitz> yup 
[09:08:33] <arschmitz> so basicly anything we ever track in classes
[09:08:42] <arschmitz> and then WITHIN THE WIDGET call .remove() on
[09:08:43] <gabriel_schulhof> So, in that case, you cannot assume that the widget is being removed by itself.
[09:08:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats completely out side the scope of this
[09:09:07] <arschmitz> anything that happens outside the widget itself
[09:09:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, wait a sec.
[09:09:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Then you only need to check this.element for whether its detached or not.
[09:09:39] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and any elements that are generated that are not children of this.element.
[09:10:06] <gabriel_schulhof> If this.element is detached, dump the whole widget. Your job is done.
[11:06:00] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, i found that out. makes it kinda hard to rebuild what options were checked
[11:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> Why? Just use the js file.
[11:06:33] <_zoggy_> shame there isnt a sidecard file that has the options/whats enabled all in one link.. so you dont have to decipher what was done
[11:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> There should actually be a link in your css file.
[11:07:03] <_zoggy_> yes, which is what i sued
[11:07:06] <_zoggy_> used
[11:07:22] <_zoggy_> but it doesnt reflect was checked off or not (as you mentioned, not all things have css)
[11:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the theme link doesn't contain components.
