[07:13:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[07:13:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Hey!
[07:14:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! I want to ask my boss for a Win8 phone.
[07:14:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do they all have an implementation of the pointer events?
[07:14:22] <arschmitz> yes
[07:14:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: i.e., does it matter which one I get?
[07:14:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I guess it does not.
[07:14:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, good. I'll probably get the cheapest possible one then,.
[07:14:46] <arschmitz> yeah 
[07:15:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: check this out http://jsbin.com/uzaret/834/edit
[07:15:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i put a wrapper on the ui datepicker works with out ui core too
[07:17:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[07:17:47] <_|Nix|_> Wow! That was easy :) Score another widget for mobile ;) *wipe hands*
[07:17:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not quite as simple as the tabs but not bad
[07:18:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because ui datepicker is not a widget
[07:18:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so to wrape it i wrote a date mobile widget thats just a wrapper on the datepicker
[07:18:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, so that's why it's not $.widget( "ui.datepicker", $.ui.datepicker, {} ) at the top of that jsbin.
[07:18:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[07:18:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I see. Cool!
[07:19:21] <arschmitz> basicly copy all the methods and options and just allow them to pass through with a little magic for adding the mobile styles
[07:19:24] <_|Nix|_> Now, if only I could find time to finish cleaning up the custom select ...
[07:19:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Extremely cool!
[07:19:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: did you see its geting failures?
[07:19:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It is?
[07:19:51] <_|Nix|_> Woah ... must check.
[07:20:11] <arschmitz> yeah ever since the merge select is getting failures though its not consistant
[07:20:12] <_|Nix|_> Man, I'm totally overwhelmed ...
[07:20:20] <arschmitz> busy with intel stuff?
[07:20:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, aside from that October conference, not much Intel stuff, just soooo much jQuery stuff.
[07:21:03] <arschmitz> yeah there is a ton to do right now
[07:21:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and these pointer events have shot right rhrough our plans.
[07:21:38] <arschmitz> this i actually just did the datepicker because i needed one for work
[07:21:45] <arschmitz> and figured might as well just do it right lol
[07:21:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just one more thing about pointer events: They /are/ slated to take over touch and mouse on the Web, right?
[07:22:17] <arschmitz> essentially yeah
[07:22:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know ... I wish I had synergies like that.
[07:22:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Good. That should add a nice punch to my request.
[07:23:31] <arschmitz> yeah im going to try and order one this week too dont know how we can get pointer events in with out it lol
[07:24:41] <kborchers> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ you should not base a mobile datepicker off of UI's
[07:25:03] <kborchers> it is going to be completely rewritten
[07:25:07] <arschmitz> kborchers: we know
[07:25:27] <arschmitz> this is just a very thin wrapper on it and not even sure it will make it into library
[07:25:46] <arschmitz> but its one of our most requested features so good to at least provide a temp solution
[07:25:56] <arschmitz> there are no good datepickers really for mobile right now
[07:25:58] <kborchers> arschmitz: right but what i am saying is it should not make it in … that should not even be considered
[07:57:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! So, this'd be my first talk on jQM ... whaddya think of the abstract? https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/5806040
[07:59:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so kinda a state of the project / whats new talk 
[07:59:22] <arschmitz> sounds good
[07:59:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: where are you giving that?
[08:01:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://html5devconf.com/
[08:02:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome
[08:02:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, let's hope I'll get to give it ...
[08:02:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can submit other proposals too ... though I'm not sure I'll have time to flesh them out ...
[08:03:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking, like work on performance tracking, or maybe the nav stuff ...
[08:03:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But this is a good starting point, I hope.
[08:03:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think im going to get a lumia 520 uGoMobi has a 920 so its different and i found one for $150
[08:04:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Dang! $150, eh? Wow!
[08:04:32] <arschmitz> yeah exactly lol
[08:05:18] <arschmitz> and i looked up a list of windows phones and its generally rated the best and most affordable one
[08:12:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good to know. ... and it's from Nokia, so I'm sure my boss won't mind supporting the local economy.
[08:12:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, I should get something different from either you or uGoMobi.
[08:12:44] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:12:52] <arschmitz> get a samsung they make a windows 8 phone
[08:12:56] <arschmitz> not sure price though
[08:15:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's a good bet that it's more expensive here than where you're at :)
[08:15:11] <arschmitz> yeah sadly
[08:15:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm .... Nokia Lumia 620 is 230€ ... not bad ...
[08:16:02] <arschmitz> yeah thats a step up from the 520 the one im looking at
[08:16:17] <arschmitz> would certainly have the nokia lumia series covered lol
[08:16:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess ... we should probably try to widen the horizon ... I'm still looking ...
[08:17:09] <arschmitz> yeah im looking at the htc 8x 
[08:17:55] <arschmitz> found one for $185
[08:18:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Samsung ATIV S is 330€ ...
[08:18:33] <arschmitz> ouch
[08:21:19] <arschmitz> im going to get one of those two i think tonight
[08:21:39] <arschmitz> the lumia 520 or the htc 8x only $35 different
[08:22:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's cool! Well, I'm trying to get Intel to pay for it, so it may not be so much for them - I hope ... man ... USA rox0rz for low prices - hands down.
[08:22:16] <gseguin> hey
[08:22:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hey!
[08:22:37] <gseguin> should we change the topic on #jquerymobile-dev
[08:22:46] <gseguin> as well as moderate it
[08:22:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: is there anything you want me to get for you for test devices we talked about it in portland but you never said if you actually needed anything ?
[08:22:59] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, and gnarf was talking about an automagic bounce to #jqueryui-dev.
[08:23:22] <gseguin> oh, my IRC magic skill are pretty limited
[08:23:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I'd like to get Intel to pitch in if I can, before using the Foundation's money.
[08:23:31] <gseguin> for the time being I'll +m it
[08:23:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah both the phones im looking are used too which is why they are so inexpensive
[08:23:55] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Can you also set the topic to point people to #jqueryui-dev.
[08:23:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah lol well let me know if you need something 
[08:24:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. How long do you think I should wait before I give up and ask you to grab something for me?
[08:24:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm thinking a week ... no more ...
[08:25:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, if I wait at all, it'll take a while to get going on those pointer events.
[08:25:21] * _|Nix|_ is snowed in - waaaay in.
[08:25:51] <gseguin> alright, changed topic and +m the channel
[08:25:57] <gseguin> later folks
[08:26:34] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[08:27:07] <gnarf> kborchers: you here?
[08:27:13] <gnarf> or hrm
[08:27:17] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: ?
[08:27:24] <kborchers> gnarf: yo
[08:27:28] <gnarf> do me a favor, leave both ui-dev and mobile-dev and try to join mobile dev
[08:28:14] <kborchers> ohai!
[08:28:18] <kborchers> gnarf: success
[08:28:26] <gnarf> kborchers: thanks
[08:29:38] <_|Nix|_> Nice! I got bounced to UI.
[08:30:05] <_|Nix|_> Extreme coolness!
[08:31:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: as far as how long to wait it does not matter too much always better to get someone else to pay
[08:31:23] <_|Nix|_> :)
[08:31:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but dont want to put this off too long
[08:31:40] <_|Nix|_> I know ... maybe I can play with polymer in the meantime.
[08:32:05] <arschmitz> but i think we have plenty to do with widgets right now that its not like this is holding us up
[08:32:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Found it for 250€ on amazon.de in the meantime. Duty-free 'n all what with EU customs union 'n all.
[08:32:39] <arschmitz> which one?
[08:32:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The Samsung ATIV S.
[08:32:49] <arschmitz> nice
[08:33:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: nice-er :)
[08:33:04] <arschmitz> yeah lol
[08:33:08] <kborchers> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ what are you guys doing with pointer events outside of what polymer already gives us?
[08:33:23] <_|Nix|_> kborchers: I guess we wanna make sure it works natively.
[08:33:26] <arschmitz> we need to make our vClick work with pointer events
[08:33:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, and that.
[08:33:37] <_|Nix|_> kborchers: ^

[08:34:57] <bot-t> gnarf, Changed "channels".
[08:34:59] <arschmitz> being mobile we cant go another version without supporting pointer events
[08:35:41] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... what a scramble ...
[08:36:30] <arschmitz> kborchers: we were originally hoping to wait for you guys but i dont think the timelines are going to match up enough to make that work
[08:37:51] <kborchers> i guess i see the need but just seems like a lot of wasted effort and code that will be thrown away
[08:38:19] <kborchers> just kind of sucks
[08:38:42] <arschmitz> kborchers: i completely agree but people are not going to take a mobile platform that does not support pointer events 2 versions after ie10 was released seriously
[08:39:32] <arschmitz> its not the path we wanted to take at all
[08:40:19] <arschmitz> we are hoping to pretty much just patch out current vmouse plugin to also accept pointer events
[08:40:27] <arschmitz> rather then actually implement pointer events
[08:40:35] <arschmitz> just to add basic ie10 support
[08:40:48] <kborchers> by pointer events though you mean MSPointer
[08:40:59] <kborchers> which doesn't totally follow the spec :/
[08:42:33] <kborchers> i don't see a good way around what you have planned … i'll keep busting my ass on old IE in polymer and i guess we'll see how it goes but yeah, i wouldn't hold my breath for it to be done in a month
[08:42:59] <arschmitz> kborchers: yeah but what we are going to do is not actually implement "pointer" events we will just patch them into vmouse the same way we do with touch
[08:43:00] <kborchers> which is unfortunate
[08:43:27] <arschmitz> that way once your work is done we can just depreciate vmouse for pointer
[08:43:34] <arschmitz> with out any weirdness 
[08:45:53] <arschmitz> all vmouse does right now is basicly say touchstart = mousedown type deal so just add MSPointerDown to that
[08:46:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Got any links to those failing select tests?
[08:46:22] <arschmitz> or something have not even started on this yet :(
[08:46:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah just one sec
[08:47:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds
[08:48:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I looked at 408 and it's not select. Same with 407. It's the usual flakiness.
[08:49:08] <arschmitz> weird maybe im going crazy swear i saw something on select cached test
[08:50:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah your right sorry guess i was losing my mind yesterday
[08:50:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NP. As long as you've found it since then ...
[08:50:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i believe so but you never knpw
[08:51:02] <_|Nix|_> :)
[08:51:13] <gseguin> nice job gnarf!
[08:51:21] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I'll continue my quest to flatten out the custom select.
[08:51:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool
[08:52:02] <gnarf> gseguin: +i for invite only, +f #channel for forward  ;)
[08:52:35] <kborchers> arschmitz: so is the motivation for adding MSPointer events that things don't work or just because it's missing? I ask because IE10 also fires mouse events and from what i've seen jQuery mobile works fine in IE10 on WP8 other than some weird issues i've seen that i don't know will be fixed by adding MSPointer support
[08:52:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's one I really can't flatten: Look for .delegate( "li:not
[08:53:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It uses /this/ and I can't get /this/ from event.target without using closest, which I'd like to avoid for perf reasons.
[08:53:23] <arschmitz> kborchers: its mostlyo our crapp slider which does not work 
[08:53:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, another handler uses .closest() to get the closest LI ...
[08:55:28] <arschmitz> and anyone using our vmouse plugin for normalized events does not support pointer 
[08:56:53] <kborchers> ok
[08:58:09] <arschmitz> kborchers: does ie10 on a tocuh device emit mouse move still?
[08:58:34] <arschmitz> wp7.5 which was essentially ie8 did not which is basicly the problem
[08:58:58] <kborchers> arschmitz: from what i can tell, yes … i am moving a slider as we speak on my WP8 device
[08:59:12] <arschmitz> kborchers: hmm this might not be a problem then
[08:59:50] <arschmitz> im getting a wp8 tonight i think once i have that to test on ill know better but sounds like this may not actually be an issue after all
[09:00:01] <kborchers> :)
[09:00:06] <kborchers> which one are you getting?
[09:00:18] <arschmitz> thinking either a lumia 520 or htc 8x
[09:00:34] <kborchers> cool, i have the 8x
[09:00:41] <arschmitz> i found them both used for under $200
[09:01:00] <kborchers> nice … i got mine new for $650 but i surely didn't pay for it :D
[09:01:12] <arschmitz> kborchers: well really im not either
[09:01:16] <arschmitz> device budget
[09:01:39] <arschmitz> but id like to stretch that budget as far as i can lol
[09:01:43] <kborchers> for sure
[09:02:08] <arschmitz> wow this would be really great to not have to patch this
[09:03:00] <kborchers> arschmitz: i am definitely seeing some issues in some demos on this device but i don't think they would be fixed by adding MSPointer to vmouse
[09:03:49] <kborchers> slider works but not great, slide to open a panel doesn't seem to work, stuff like that
[09:03:49] <arschmitz> well thats good i can look at other issues once i have a device but to not have to patch vmouse will save a ton of what would be essentially wasted work
[09:04:11] <kborchers> yeah
[09:04:12] <arschmitz> slider does not work great on anything lol
[09:04:17] <kborchers> heh
[09:05:07] <arschmitz> might have to shim it into swipe if panels dont work
[09:05:12] <arschmitz> but thats actually really minor
[09:05:34] <kborchers> swipe to close the panel works but not to open which seems weird
[09:06:27] <arschmitz> oh swipe to open is not an option on panels
[09:06:35] <arschmitz> only swipe to close so thats why
[09:08:41] <kborchers> arschmitz: i see … the Open panel on swipe demo is what i was trying and it didn't work but yeah, i just read how it's not part of the framework so whatever :)
[09:09:06] <arschmitz> lol yeah we demo a lot of stuff but much is just that a demo
[09:09:55] <arschmitz> that was my plan for that date picker wrapper just a demo so its there for people if they need it
[09:10:03] <arschmitz> but unsupported
[09:10:28] <arschmitz> because its not on the ui roadmap until 2.0 which is quite a ways off im guessing lol
[09:11:37] <kborchers> arschmitz: yeah, a little ways away … probably at the same time as a mobile 2.0 i would imagine :)
[09:11:55] <arschmitz> lol yeah 
[09:13:17] <arschmitz> kborchers: honestly i think you made my day that WP8 supports mousemove though
[09:13:49] <kborchers> good … i was hoping we could talk that through a bit because i really didn't think you guys would need to do that work
[09:14:17] <kborchers> just felt wrong but couldn't quite articulate why ;)
[09:14:22] <arschmitz> i dont have a device yet and figured since wp7 didnt and they added mspointer for that purpose it still wouldnt
[09:15:19] <arschmitz> see combined channel already paying off lol
[09:15:38] <kborchers> arschmitz: for reference http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673557(v=vs.85).aspx
[09:15:54] <kborchers> there is a quick blurb about 4 or 5 paragraphs down about mouse compat
[09:16:11] <arschmitz> kborchers: im sure you already have one but if you want a WP7.8 for anything we have an extra one 
[09:16:50] <kborchers> nah, i'll let you guys test that ;)
[09:17:15] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah we got a whole pile from microsoft and i cant even give them all away lol
[09:17:22] <kborchers> heh
[09:17:40] <arschmitz> i brought 4 to portland and only managed to give out 3 lol
[09:17:47] <kborchers> lol
[09:18:33] <arschmitz> well if you hear about any one on ui wanting one for testing we have an extra
[09:20:14] <kborchers> sounds good
[09:25:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i just bought the lumia 520
[09:25:31] <arschmitz> its on its way but wont be here until friday

[10:02:58] <gseguin> yeah it got removed for some reason
[10:03:00] <gnarf> can you make an infra issue for it?
[10:03:05] <gseguin> will do
[10:03:09] <gnarf> i didn't think anyone was using it

[11:31:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can I drop a link to the custom select onto the opening blurb of demos/widgets/selects/index.php?
[11:31:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I really need that for testing.

[11:35:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like so ^
[11:36:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i cant imagine that would be an issue
[11:37:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: did you catch the back scroll with kborchers and i?
[11:37:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: About the pointer events. Yeah.
[11:37:28] <arschmitz> i think we are off the hook for pointer
[11:37:52] <toddmparker> hey all
[11:37:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker: hey
[11:38:04] <toddmparker> my all day meeting was cut short. minor miracles.
[11:38:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I must've missed that part.
[11:38:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Hey!
[11:38:14] <toddmparker> new room, i like the decor here.
[11:38:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: WP10 emits mousemove!
[11:38:27] <arschmitz> WP8 i mean
[11:38:28] <toddmparker> how come the UI guys have a new carpet and a flat screen tv?
[11:38:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: WP10? You must mean WP8.
[11:38:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[11:38:43] <arschmitz> yeah so it works already
[11:38:44] <toddmparker> hey _|Nix|_ and arschmitz 
[11:38:59] <kborchers> toddmparker: we're good with massaging budgets ;)
[11:39:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's the eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight ...
[11:39:21] <toddmparker> not fair, but it's all good now that we're in the same clubhouse
[11:39:28] <kborchers> :)
[11:39:31] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:39:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: got a lumia 520 on the way to do testing to see if anything needs to be fixed but it should be allset for the most part
[11:40:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Very cool. Nevertheless, we should keep a close eye on things ...
[11:40:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We do need to do pointer events, just not as urgently as we thought.
[11:40:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can push out 1.4.0 and worry about it afterwards.
[11:40:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for sure just means we can wait until kborchers finishes polymer updates
[11:40:52] <toddmparker> what's the latest on pointer events?
[11:41:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: kborchers is our man.
[11:41:31] * kborchers hides
[11:41:39] <arschmitz> toddmparker: kborchers is working on getting oldie support into polymer and we are going to use that
[11:41:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Although I'd hesitate to call him "Mr. Pointer" :)
[11:42:44] <kborchers> _|Nix|_: that's Dr. Pointer thank you very much
[11:42:48] <kborchers> :P
[11:43:19] <arschmitz> toddmparker: check out this demo http://jsbin.com/uzaret/834/edit
[11:43:49] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:44:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker: wraps ui datepicker into a mobile widget and does not require mobile core
[11:44:46] <toddmparker> cool
[11:45:00] <toddmparker> polymer?
[11:45:01] <arschmitz> i meant does not require ui core lol
[11:45:04] <toddmparker> polyfill?
[11:45:16] <arschmitz> http://www.polymer-project.org/
[11:45:37] <toddmparker> pooh, right. ok.
[11:45:38] <arschmitz> its their pointer events polyfill
[11:45:48] <toddmparker> sounds like a good plan
[11:46:01] <toddmparker> so it will be a 3rd party plugin that ui and mobile will adopt?
[11:46:20] <arschmitz> well it does not work as is because it does not support oldie
[11:46:31] <arschmitz> so kborchers is basicly forking it i guess
[11:46:39] <toddmparker> gotcha
[11:46:49] <toddmparker> kborchers you are a brave one
[11:46:59] <kborchers> s/brave/crazy
[11:47:08] <toddmparker> yeah, same thing really
[11:47:10] <kborchers> :)
[11:47:21] <arschmitz> indeed 
[11:47:31] <kborchers> arschmitz: not forking … oldIE support will be included
[11:47:39] <arschmitz> oh nice
[11:47:41] <kborchers> once we do it … they just don't want to do it
[11:47:44] <kborchers> :)
[11:47:50] <arschmitz> i see
[11:48:18] <kborchers> they are breaking stuff up to make it easier since all we care about is mouse on oldIE
[11:48:26] <kborchers> i think that is done so now it's time for me to dig in
[11:48:41] <arschmitz> cool
[11:52:44] <toddmparker> great
[11:53:01] <toddmparker> is this date picker example using the ui picker but our theming?
[11:53:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yes
[11:53:14] <toddmparker> sweet
[11:53:21] <arschmitz> and its wrapped into a mobile widget with auto init
[11:53:33] <toddmparker> we hacked something like this together at filament but we nixed it
[11:53:39] <toddmparker> after a while
[11:53:40] <arschmitz> yeah iv seen it
[11:53:45] <toddmparker> cool to see this being added in
[11:53:52] <toddmparker> people will really like this
[11:54:01] <toddmparker> are you sing the new new classes option for this?
[11:54:28] <arschmitz> no cant truely extend the ui one because its not a widget
[11:55:01] <arschmitz> so this is just a wrapper it uses the same options and and methods and just passes them through
[11:55:28] <arschmitz> datepicker is on the ui road map to be turned into a widget but not until 2.0 so it will be a while
[11:56:20] <arschmitz> ill probably just make this a really well documented demo since its just temp
[11:58:18] <arschmitz> the 1.4 theming made this a lot easier then it would have been. and i think it looks good
[11:59:50] <toddmparker> i does, nice work
[12:00:24] <arschmitz> needed one for a project so i hacked on this last night to see if i could do like i did with tabs
[12:01:21] <arschmitz> its not as clean and nice as tabs because datepicker isnt a widget but it still works well and integrates perfectly with the mobile theme
[12:01:56] <timmywil> am I crazy or is testswarm the only way to automate running dynamic test pages across browsers?
[12:02:08] <Krinkle> It is
[12:02:12] <Krinkle> Well, for us.
[12:02:27] <timmywil> afaict, no other cross-browser testing tool does this
[12:04:47] <timmywil> I've tried yeti(with and w/o bunyip) and karma. I could probably figure out a way to do it manually with browserstack-cli or something, but I'd be re-writing a lot.
[12:05:58] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#409 (master - bd30ca9 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build was broken.
[12:05:58] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/ea8af4b61637...bd30ca985940
[12:05:58] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/8207895
[12:06:05] <toddmparker> just needs a bit of padding and a max width - http://jsbin.com/uzaret/845/edit
[12:06:19] <toddmparker> might not quite fit at 320
[12:06:55] <arschmitz> yeah im actually adjusting that right now because i was trying on some phones
[12:08:05] <timmywil> I think the key is no other framework requires an equivalent to inject.js on the page. Tests must be run from the tool's context only.
[12:09:10] <timmywil> anyway, kudos testswarmies. I don't think people realize how powerful it is.
[12:09:38] <toddmparker> arschmitz: better - http://jsbin.com/uzaret/846/edit
[12:10:06] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah looks good
[12:10:22] <toddmparker> less padding so a narrower min-width may be preferable - http://jsbin.com/uzaret/847/edit
[12:10:37] <toddmparker> i know it's odd to have it not be as wide as the input but it gets so blobbed out otherwise
[12:10:58] <arschmitz> yeah i think its fine though
[12:11:02] <toddmparker> is this going to be a demo?
[12:11:07] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:11:19] <toddmparker> cool
[12:11:48] <arschmitz> seems a little weird as part of lib since datepicker is going to be refactored
[12:12:53] <toddmparker> yeah
[12:13:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: maybe ill make a repo for it so we can point people to it for issues and stuff
[12:13:13] <toddmparker> but people do like these things. just don't want to own the code until it's re-factored
[12:13:16] <toddmparker> sure
[12:13:40] <arschmitz> exactly best to have it not offically supported
[12:13:45] <toddmparker> alex got the ui picker working again for mobile fwiw - http://jsbin.com/uzaret/847/edit
[12:14:03] <toddmparker> heh, wrong window
[12:14:10] <arschmitz> lol
[12:14:57] <toddmparker> once date picker is re-factored to be smaller, this will be awesome. just do darn heavy now.
[12:16:06] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[12:16:30] <arschmitz> but there are no good mobile datepickers right now
[12:16:38] <arschmitz> so figured its better then nothing
[12:16:58] <arschmitz> they are all things you have to drag and spin and they are very awkward on desktop
[12:17:03] <toddmparker> for sure
[12:17:35] <toddmparker> be cool to figure out how to offer a js calendar but also leave the input type of date intact
[12:17:52] <arschmitz> hmm
[12:17:54] <toddmparker> issue is on desktop the date inputs are a crappy version of the js calendar
[12:18:08] <toddmparker> on mobile, you get a different control (spinners)
[12:18:23] <toddmparker> we fought with it on a client project and bailed. went with the cal.
[12:18:41] <arschmitz> yeah seems like it would be weird
[12:18:50] <arschmitz> and hard to make consistant
[12:19:45] <arschmitz> nice thing about calendar too is you can hide the input if you want
[12:20:08] <arschmitz> since the calendar it self gives feedback seeing the input is not really needed
[12:20:47] <arschmitz> save a little space for mobile lol
[12:21:46] <toddmparker> right
[12:21:57] <toddmparker> inline vs. a helper popup on focus
[12:22:35] <arschmitz> yeah i decided the popup on small screens was a bad idea
[12:22:46] <arschmitz> so this does not support that inline only
[12:23:33] <arschmitz> pretty sure thats how the filament one was also
[12:28:06] <toddmparker> it was, tho we're building the overlay version as we speak. has a place.
[12:51:41] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I'd like to start working (again) on the datepicker rewrite much sooner. Any input on that is very welcome! 
[12:52:14] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: awesome im happy to help as well
[12:52:28] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: the code will be completely new, the keyboard interaction much better, but theme and mouse interaction would be the same. Unless you have suggestions to make it better on mobile.
[12:53:12] <jzaefferer> ignore the "older templates", but the two examples above should work fine: http://view.jqueryui.com/datepicker/datepicker-rewrite/
[12:53:34] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the interaction seems good on mobile
[12:53:52] <arschmitz> themeing we would just want to be able to apply our theme to it with out too much trouble
[12:54:14] <arschmitz> which should be simple enough if its an actual widget
[12:54:31] <jzaefferer> right
[12:55:19] <jzaefferer> how do you deal with native support for type="date"?
[12:55:35] <jzaefferer> ah, your demo doesn't actually use that
[12:55:39] <arschmitz> right now we dont have a datepicker at all so we dont
[12:55:41] <jzaefferer> just data-role=date
[12:56:01] <arschmitz> oh yeah no native type date trys to do too much on its own
[12:56:59] <jzaefferer> there are a few keyboard shortcuts to switch months and years quickly: page up/down for months, alt+page up/down for years. We'll need some tappable UI elements to expose those on mobile.
[12:57:17] <jzaefferer> I think the current datepicker has an option to show selects for month and year
[12:57:28] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah but i think the button config option in the roadmap would take care of that
[12:57:55] <arschmitz> i was looking at the write up on the wiki for the new ui one earlier
[12:58:12] <arschmitz> and yeah pretty sure the current one has an option for selects
[12:58:40] <jzaefferer> Where exactly did you find the button option?
[13:00:01] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137778/Datepicker
[13:00:10] <arschmitz> 4 bullet point 
[13:00:34] <jzaefferer> ah, that.
[13:02:03] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: one thing to keep in mind is that for mobile we will always be adding an extension for autoinit to the widget
[13:02:16] <arschmitz> so if there are minor things that need to be changed for mobile
[13:02:38] <arschmitz> they can be done within there as long as its setup such that its easy to extend in the way we need
[13:03:06] <jzaefferer> yeah, that's fine
[13:03:18] <jzaefferer> though we should aim for making these wrappers pretty generic
[13:03:23] <arschmitz> yes
[13:03:27] <arschmitz> the less the better
[13:03:30] <jzaefferer> that is, not requiring a specific wrapper for every widget if it can be avoided
[13:03:47] <jzaefferer> is tabs coming in 1.4 or 1.5?
[13:04:01] <arschmitz> 1.4
[13:04:03] <arschmitz> its already done
[13:04:05] <jzaefferer> that's the first UI widget to really make it into mobile, right?
[13:04:10] <arschmitz> yes
[13:04:11] <jzaefferer> ah, in master?
[13:04:24] <arschmitz> no in a branch but nothing holding back from merging its done
[13:04:52] <arschmitz> http://view.jquerymobile.com/tabs/demos/widgets/tabs/
[13:05:24] <jzaefferer> btw. why I was looking in here in the first place: http://code.jquery.com/ still links to 1.3.0, not 1.3.1
[13:05:36] <jzaefferer> the files are up, just not linked to
[13:05:54] <arschmitz> yeah i noticed that in portland actually not sure who updates that do you happen to know?
[13:06:20] <jzaefferer> well, its manual editing of the html file, then a ?reload request to update the CDN
[13:06:23] <jzaefferer> it sucks
[13:06:29] <arschmitz> oh i see
[13:07:06] <jzaefferer> I've got notes for that for QUnit here: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/
[13:07:16] <jzaefferer> Then update /var/www/html/code.jquery.com/index.html and purge it with:
[13:07:16] <jzaefferer> curl -s http://code.origin.jquery.com/?reload
[13:07:23] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the wrapper tabs is VERY generic https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/tabs/js/widgets/tabs.js
[13:07:33] <jzaefferer> ssh to code.origin.jquery.com
[13:07:48] <arschmitz> its actually mostly the uuid function 
[13:07:58] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: nice. 
[13:08:04] <jzaefferer> it doesn't need removeUniqueId?
[13:08:10] <arschmitz> essentially 3 lines
[13:08:54] <arschmitz> hmm actually that should be there i belive
[13:09:28] <arschmitz> yup definitely should
[13:10:03] <jzaefferer> cool stuff
[13:10:37] <arschmitz> but yeah the wrapper is really simple and the uuid stuff is going to be pulled out once we incorperate ui core anyway
[13:10:50] <arschmitz> which scott and i have been talking about for a while now
[13:11:28] <jzaefferer> I still hope we can get rid of ui core one day. Currently not realistic, but that may change...
[13:11:58] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah scott trimed a bunch out already to slim down to make it smaller for us to incorperate
[13:12:10] <arschmitz> and im working on simplifying and breaking up the mobile core
[13:12:49] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i was actually looking at it last night thinking we should break out all our data functions for namespaced data attributes into its own module
[13:13:01] <jzaefferer> do you have access to code.origin.jquery.com? if not, gnarf is still a lot faster in updating puppet stuff to hand out access. Though I wonder who uploaded those files in the first place...
[13:13:44] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i think so if not im on the infra repo so i should be able to add myself in theory i think
[13:18:18] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: right, just find a commit that also adds someone to the same server, that's likely the best reference
[13:18:32] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah looking for it right now
[13:18:46] <arschmitz> do you know which server that is on?
[13:19:42] <jzaefferer> jq03
[13:19:52] <jzaefferer> the "services" node, I think
[13:20:05] <arschmitz> ah ok im already on jq03 anyway lol
[13:21:25] <arschmitz> thanks for the instructions on updating that
[13:24:05] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: any ETA on 1.4?
[13:24:22] <arschmitz> we are shooting for alpha begining of july sometime
[13:24:30] <jzaefferer> I've got this other project where I'm building a custom widget using listview and panel. That works so much better with 1.4pre.
[13:25:00] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: im sure iv done major updates to both of those widgets plus all the simplified markup from new theme
[13:25:29] <arschmitz> that uGoMobi did should make them much more flexible
[13:28:55] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: just gisted my notes for an earlier Mobile/UI review, where I looked through Mobile widgets: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/5b16b9aa19726f351d90
[13:29:17] <jzaefferer> Still want to do the same for UI, though I suspect it might be better if someone with more exposure to mobile would do that.
[13:29:43] <jzaefferer> Putting those (then) two lists together we should be able to figure out where each widget should "live" in the future
[13:30:02] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: very nice ill read through that
[13:32:23] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: how longago did you do this?
[13:32:45] <jzaefferer> when flying to Portland, on the 6th
[13:32:55] <jzaefferer> so all based on 1.3
[13:33:00] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: ok cool 
[13:33:12] <arschmitz> i agree with most of what you have there
[13:33:52] <arschmitz> a few things here are addrssed with 1.4 but most is still valid
[13:35:22] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: for dialogs we are planning on depreciating the current dialog and just making those a regular page thats just styled that way
[13:37:46] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: one thing i see you address here in several places that i personally would like a consistant way of handling is back button to close
[13:38:12] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: this is super common and expected on mobile devices but presents a challenge to hook into navigation and history]
[13:38:53] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: my goal is to make an extension that can be addedto a widget to essentially tack on this functionality
[13:39:22] <gnarf> i would suggest using jqadmin@jq03 for updating code.jquery.com
[13:40:08] <arschmitz> gnarf: thank you had not actually got to doing that yet but wil make sure i do
[13:43:15] <gnarf> just add yourself to the authorized_keys
[13:43:32] <arschmitz> ok
