[06:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> Not really.
[06:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, I deleted the code in trunk.

[12:27:22] <rxaviers> gnarf, image generation on node is implemented. But, machine does not have image magick installed (note I need image magick, not graphics magick ok)...
[12:34:09] <gnarf> rxaviers: apt-get it?
[12:34:18] <gnarf> ill add a thing to puppet
[12:37:46] <gnarf> rxaviers: i got it
[13:10:04] <rxaviers> gnarf, Im back. Yeah, I know how to, but I didnt want to install it, because I dont know if it would mess anything for you
[13:10:38] <rxaviers> good news is after we conclude testing it, we can get rid of old.jq :)
[13:26:27] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, gnarf, jzaefferer, anyone around?
[13:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:30:02] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: awesome
[13:30:08] <scott_gonzalez> Saw the issues getting closed :-)
[13:30:36] <rxaviers> the last jqueryui.com commit I made didnt build. It failed.
[13:31:20] <rxaviers> >> npm ERR! invalid: pkginfo@0.3.0 /usr/local/wordpress-repos/jqueryui.com/node_modules/grunt-clean/node_modules/grunt/node_modules/prompt/node_modules/pkginfo
[13:31:35] <rxaviers> :S
[13:31:40] <rxaviers> what is it about?
[13:31:57] <rxaviers> is a package not avialable anymore?
[13:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure, let me try to install.
[13:33:42] <scott_gonzalez> Install works fine for me.
[13:36:51] <rxaviers> I've rerun it on the machine and same error
[13:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[13:38:43] <gnarf> rxaviers: something strange is happening on jq02 with that message
[13:38:49] <gnarf> i've seen it a few times 
[13:39:00] <gnarf> I think im just gonna blow up everyones node_modules in there
[13:39:06] <gnarf> just so it reinstalls em all next deploy
[13:39:12] <gnarf> it fixed the issue for the other sites
[13:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> grunt-clean is crazy.
[13:39:28] <scott_gonzalez> At least that version is, hopefully newer versions are less crazy.
[13:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> But those deps an insanity.
[13:39:45] <rxaviers> af
[13:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You can work around it for now by just removing grunt-clean.
[13:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> And getting rid of the clean task in grunt.js locally.
[13:40:34] <rxaviers> ok
[13:47:10] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, thks
[13:47:12] <rxaviers> built it
[13:47:14] <rxaviers> lets check
[13:47:56] <rxaviers> great :)
[13:48:06] <rxaviers> we gave new images generation live on stage http://stage.jqueryui.com/
[13:48:39] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go.
[13:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> But if this is working we can deploy it next week.
[13:48:54] <scott_gonzalez> Would be awesome.
[14:02:42] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hello :-) I have a very quick question for you: could mamp be the thing that is now making a 'deep trumpet noise' on my Mac Book Pro?
[14:15:41] <rxaviers> sure ;)
[14:19:33] <rxaviers> af I've restarted download builder on stage and it seems it didnt go up
[14:27:59] <gnarf> how did you restart it?
[14:29:20] <gnarf> rxaviers: out of memory error
[14:29:36] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/e993f9a9224192934bdd
[14:29:38] <rxaviers> # /etc/init.d/download.sh restart
[14:30:07] <gnarf> rxaviers: yeah, something in the startup is using a rediculous amount of RAM :)
[14:30:40] <gnarf> rxaviers: it chews through like 1.5 gig of ram 
[14:30:43] <gnarf> then blows up
[14:31:33] <rxaviers> ohoh... do you think aynthing else consumed ram and it didnt left for download builder Or DB is leaking?
[14:33:09] <gnarf> rxaviers: i mean i run "free" while its starting
[14:33:14] <gnarf> and it goes from 1.4 gig free
[14:33:16] <gnarf> to like 100k
[14:33:17] <gnarf> then boom
[14:33:20] <gnarf> and back to 1.4gig
[14:33:30] <gnarf> so something is taking up gigs of ram while its processing tags
[14:33:50] <gnarf> or "caching"
[14:33:53] <gnarf> or whatever this part is
[14:42:53] <rxaviers> af, thanks
[14:43:02] <rxaviers> good to know will check what's going on
