[12:10:10] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez arschmitz: what's the current state wrt compatibility with jQuery 3? Does UI 1.12 fully support it? I assume there won't be a compatibility update for UI 1.11? And what about Mobile?
[12:10:29] <arschmitz> 1.12 fully supports it
[12:10:39] <arschmitz> there will be an update to 1.11 to support it
[12:10:50] <arschmitz> mobile 1.4.5 should work with migrate
[12:11:04] <arschmitz> 1.5 which the alpha for should be released next week supports it
[12:11:35] <arschmitz> there will be a 1.4.6 to support it without migrate
[12:12:02] <arschmitz> m_gol: ^^
[12:13:24] <m_gol> thx, arschmitz. I was wondering because of https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3193#issuecomment-238601235 :)
[12:13:59] <arschmitz> m_gol: well that might be a bug we dont know about
[12:14:16] <m_gol> k, good to know about the official state anyway :)
[12:14:17] <arschmitz> all tests pass and we have not had an reports on our tracker
[12:15:32] <m_gol> arschmitz: yeah, it's about transformed elements, maybe you don't have tests for that. And we plan to fix it in Core 3.2.0 anyway.
[12:15:49] <arschmitz> pretty sure we dont have tests for that
