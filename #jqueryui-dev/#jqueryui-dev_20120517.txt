[07:58:12] <FJ1> what's the simplest way to test jQuery UI 1.9pre? download from github and build with grunt? or is there a "zip" file somewhere?
[08:00:49] <kborchers> FJ1: you can build from master yourself or you can download the tag (latest is 1.9.0m8 from here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tags
[08:01:04] <FJ1> thx
[08:01:41] <FJ1> 1.9.0m8 = 1.9pre ?
[08:02:04] <kborchers> FJ1: that is the latest tagged version of what will become 1.9 yes
[08:02:53] <FJ1> ok.
[08:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> FJ1: Yes, milestone releases are 1.9.0pre tags at specific times. 1.9.0m8 was just tagged about an hour ago :-)
[08:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> But other than that, yes, running grunt will generate a build for you.
[08:07:24] <FJ1> what are the new features? Spinner, Tooltip and Menu?
[08:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, those are the new widgets.
[08:08:23] <scott_gonzalez> Also, lots of API changes.
[08:08:25] <kborchers> FJ1: Check out http://blog.jqueryui.com/2012/05/jquery-ui-1-9-milestone-8-position/

[08:08:56] <kborchers> FJ1: and the milestone blogs before that as well
[08:10:10] <FJ1> ok. i'll do some tests. thx!

[14:51:28] <scott_gonzalez> koopersmith: If I want to write a custom XML-RPC method for a specific site, should I just stick it in mu-plugins or is there a better place for site-specific plugins?
[14:52:06] <koopersmith> scott_gonzalez: depends on the setup
[14:52:18] <scott_gonzalez> web-base-template
[14:52:21] <scott_gonzalez> This is for the plugins site.
[14:52:27] <koopersmith> figured :)
[14:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> I want to write a method that will return the post id given a plugin name.
[14:53:03] <scott_gonzalez> Since there's no search functionality in the current XML-RPC implementation.
[14:54:01] <koopersmith> So, since it's by-site, and the code is hypothetically reusable, I would say add it to plugins
[14:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[14:54:21] <koopersmith> and enable it for whichever sites you need
[14:56:50] <scott_gonzalez> Well, XML-RPC extensions are automatically on.
[14:57:06] <scott_gonzalez> It won't hurt to have it exist for other sites.
[14:57:15] <scott_gonzalez> I was just wondering if that was the best way to do it.
[14:58:00] <koopersmith> If you want to enable it on a per-site basis, I'd think so.

[22:09:18] <rodaz_laptop> Hi, I'm working with jquery-easyui, and it's been a huge help, but I'm having a little issue. Strange as it might sound, can I set a draggable object to have more than one handle?
