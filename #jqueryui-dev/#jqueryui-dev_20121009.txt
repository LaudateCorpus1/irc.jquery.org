[05:28:47] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Can you test this on your tablet? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8633
[05:29:04] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't updated past the pre-release on mine yet.
[05:35:46] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: On Windows 8 with the mouse it works, but nothing is selectable with touch
[05:35:59] <DaveMethvin> movable that is
[05:36:55] <scott_gonzalez> stupid touch
[05:37:27] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Just to confirm that's not a regression: http://view.jqueryui.com/1.8.24/demos/sortable/default.html
[05:39:14] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: yeah, same behavior
[05:39:23] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'm going to close that ticket as worksforme.
[05:40:02] <DaveMethvin> how's that?
[05:41:05] <scott_gonzalez> It's not about touch, it's about the sorting not working based on the page being scrolled.
[05:41:17] <scott_gonzalez> But you said it worked fine for you.
[05:41:26] <scott_gonzalez> And it worked fine for me in BrowserStack.
[05:41:51] <DaveMethvin> with touch it doesn't work at all
[05:41:56] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] rdworth pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/mR8Gbg
[05:41:56] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Dialog: add required closing tag </button>. Fixes #8639 - jQuery 1.9.0 dialog on a XHTML page is broken if buttons are defined - Richard D. Worth
[05:42:05] <DaveMethvin> but touch should be faking mouse events
[05:42:19] <DaveMethvin> as it is on tablets, sortable is non-functional
[05:42:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not sure why that's not working, but touch support is a completely different thing.
[05:42:49] <scott_gonzalez> This bug seems to be specifically about a problem when the page is scrolled.
[05:42:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i didn't see that
[05:43:05] <DaveMethvin> but if you are using pagex/y
[05:43:15] <DaveMethvin> there is a bug they stealth-fixed at the last minute
[05:43:35] <DaveMethvin> pagex was wrong when an element was scrolled
[05:43:36] <DaveMethvin> maybe that's what this guy was seeing
[05:45:03] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe, I just bumped the ticket back to him for clarification.

[05:47:56] <doesallmagic> rdworth: Dialog: add required closing tag </button>. Fixes #8639 - jQuery 1.9.0 dialog on a XHTML page is broken if buttons are defined
[05:53:33] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: if you add .ui-sortable { -ms-touch-action: none } it works right for touch
[05:54:11] <DaveMethvin> by default it's using the touch motions to pan/zoom the page
[05:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> ok, thanks
[05:58:05] <erethnor> hiya - if any project dev could reopen this bug it'd be great: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8568
[05:58:16] <erethnor> thanks!

[06:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> This IE8 position BS is pissing me off.
[06:19:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can we kill that single test?
[06:20:37] <erethnor> scott_gonzalez: thanks!
[06:25:01] <nacin-away> what server is blog.jqueryui.com on?
[06:31:04] <rworth> nacin: ui-dev.jquery.com (70.32.121.208)
[06:31:46] <rworth> nacin: never mind. That's the old server (my info is out-of-date)
[06:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Deleting the test seems bad.
[06:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: It's on eol2.
[07:07:53] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: so, it's running the new theme, just on the old server still.
[07:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:08:15] <nacin> that switch expected soon?
[07:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> There's a copy of the jquery and jqueryui.com themes in https://github.com/jquery/blog.jqueryui.com-theme
[07:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the plan is to merge into blog.jquery.com.
[07:08:36] <nacin> oh right
[07:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> So that can't happen until jquery.com is deployed.
[07:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> Which is planned for January, though I'm trying to get that date pushed up.
[07:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's a simple site, no reason to artificially delay the deployment just for jQuery's birthday.
[07:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> I seemed to have half buy-in from the team to move the date up.
[07:09:42] <nacin> seeing some caching issues on the blog
[07:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'll harass everyone in person at the summit :-)
[07:10:01] <nacin> so, I enabled mystery avatars: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2012/10/jquery-ui-1-9-0/comment-page-1/#comment-4000
[07:10:05] <nacin> still looks completely unstyled
[07:10:14] <nacin> gradient is too harsh, lacks padding everywhere, etc.
[07:10:22] <nacin> comments were a complete afterthought for these themes
[07:10:41] <nacin> but otherwise, you're all set :-)
[07:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, they definitely were.
[07:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> This is what happens when you don't have any designer resources available...
[07:11:30] <nacin> one of ours will be at the summit
[07:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> Our designers should be there too, hopefully they'll actually be able to help with jqueryui.com.
[07:22:35] <jzaefferer> nacin: can we switch to smaller avatars? That along with floating them to the left and some more styles on the rest would probably do the trick
[08:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/739
[08:32:21] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: jQuery.css isn't a documented interface, for better or worse
[08:32:24] <DaveMethvin> so it got changed here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/bc7231e3230b8f2c59b3370e7cae6b8a30d53c1e
[08:32:34] <DaveMethvin> no unit tests since it's an internal thign
[08:33:03] * scott_gonzalez rolls eyes
[08:33:17] <scott_gonzalez> Who adds parameters in the middle?
[08:33:19] <DaveMethvin> i could have sworn it was public
[08:33:34] <DaveMethvin> it was probably done to simplify .access()
[08:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> probably
[08:34:03] <scott_gonzalez> So this brings us to version parsing?
[08:34:40] <DaveMethvin> i guess, although the root problem is that it's undocumented and has  no unit tests
[08:35:12] <DaveMethvin> it seems  like it should be documented
[08:35:19] <DaveMethvin> for symmetry with jQuery.attr etc
[08:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, wait, this was introduced in 1.8.0?
[08:35:34] <DaveMethvin> the arg change, yes
[08:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so no need for version parsing.
[08:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> If curCSS doesn't exist, then css needs the false.
[08:36:23] <DaveMethvin> yay? :P
[08:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> In <=1.7.2, it was always the equivalent of false, correct?
[08:38:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah looks liie it
[08:38:05] <DaveMethvin> like
[08:39:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok, thanks
[08:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[08:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> I don't want to do another 1.8 release.
[08:40:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm tempted to not land this.
[08:41:32] <DaveMethvin> you'll  probably need to do another 1.8, just save it up
[08:42:49] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I'm not sure that we have the infrastructure to do it.
[08:42:58] <DaveMethvin> oh
[08:43:09] <DaveMethvin> well then definitely wait
[08:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> That's why I pushed 1.8.24 right before 1.9.0 instead of right after.
[08:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> My original plan was to do it after to ensure all fixes that made it into 1.9.0 that could be merged made it into 1.8.24.
[08:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> But then I realized all hell might break loose if I try to do a 1.8 deploy to something other than jqueryui.com.
[08:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> And the new site won't work with 1-8-stable.
[08:44:58] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure it can be solved by lots of manual error-prone steps
[08:45:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure
[08:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> And it'll only be available on old.jqueryui.com :-P
[08:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose we could do a release and just put the zip on GitHub.
[08:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> No download builder support for 1.8.25.
[08:46:00] <DaveMethvin> so how far reaching is this anyway?
[08:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...that would also mean no CDN.
[08:46:21] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure.
[08:46:29] <DaveMethvin> just get everyone to upgrade to 1.9
[08:46:36] <scott_gonzalez> That's my thought.
[08:46:45] <relipse> what is so good about jquery 1.9?
[08:47:07] <DaveMethvin> relipse: it's 0.1 better than 1.8
[08:47:26] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, this is only affecting people on jQuery 1.8, so they shouldn't have any barrier to upgrade.
[08:47:37] <DaveMethvin> true
[08:47:44] <DaveMethvin> mostly new dev
[08:47:52] <DaveMethvin> where they should be using 1.9 anyway
[08:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9.0 is supposed to have 100% back compat.
[08:48:03] <DaveMethvin> ok, leave the bug in too :P
[08:48:24] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[08:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> relipse: Did you have a serious question about 1.9?
[08:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: re:sorting http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8633#comment:8
[08:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> Should I just close as wontfix?
[08:55:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's certainly not something we should be handling in UI.
[08:55:31] <scott_gonzalez> If the problem becomes widespread, it'd have to be fixed in core.
[08:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm hoping that's not the case.
[08:55:41] <DaveMethvin> close that wontfix,  i'll add  a ref to the core ticket
[09:02:11] <rxaviers> guys, Im just passing by to let you know I'll be (back) online tonight (in 6h)
[09:02:54] <rxaviers> I saw there are bugs in TR, will work on it as soon as Im back the hotel
[10:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> *sigh* "Just do not know whether this is bug or feature, just saying I found it peculiar :)" Gee thanks, we need more people filing tickets for things they find odd even though it's not a bug...
[10:21:04] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: it *could* have been a bug
[10:21:16] * ryanneufeld ducks
[10:57:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: any more issues this morn?
[11:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Seems good so far.
[12:12:51] <_zoggy_> 1.9.1 soon?
