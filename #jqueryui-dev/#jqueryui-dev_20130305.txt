[10:29:36] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, team, guys my flight yesterday on toronto was delayed and I missed the flight to BR. Im travelling today. I think I wont make it to the team meeting tomorrow.
[10:29:59] <rxaviers> just wanted to let you know
[10:37:54] <gnarf> rxaviers: no prob
[10:38:01] <rxaviers> ;)
[10:38:01] <gnarf> rxaviers: dunno that we will have one, who knows
[11:12:56] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15adamboduch opened pull request #928: Easier use of _hoverable() and _focusable() (06master...06master)  02http://git.io/8ngs4w
[17:14:35] <paul_irish>  if (!$("<a>").outerWidth(1).jquery) {
[17:14:40] <paul_irish> what is the purpose of that line?
[17:19:55] <Krinkle> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.1/jquery-ui.js
[17:20:02] <Krinkle> // support: jQuery <1.8
[17:20:02] <Krinkle> if ( !$( "<a>" ).outerWidth( 1 ).jquery ) {
[17:20:02] <Krinkle> 	$.each( [ "Width", "Height" ], function( i, name ) {
[17:20:04] <Krinkle> 		var side = name === "Width" ? [ "Left", "Right" ] : [ "Top", "Bottom" ],
[17:20:06] <Krinkle> </quote>
[17:20:08] <Krinkle> interesting
[17:21:21] <Krinkle> paul_irish: I looks like it should be !$.fn.outerWidth
[17:21:23] <Krinkle> ah, I see
[17:21:34] <Krinkle> between it being a setter and getter as well
[17:21:48] <Krinkle> if it isn't a setter, the number returned (Number or String) has no .jquery property
[17:21:50] <Krinkle> xD
[17:22:05] <Krinkle> paul_irish: 
[17:22:08] <paul_irish> It's just an expensive feature detect
[17:22:17] <paul_irish> possible to avoid?
[17:22:33] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: 
[19:46:21] <gnarf> paul_irish: know which file feature detects that?
