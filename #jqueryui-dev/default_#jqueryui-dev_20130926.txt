[02:27:44] <googol7> hi
[02:28:49] <uGoMobi> googol7: hi Philipp
[02:29:15] <uGoMobi> googol7: did you create a JS Bin for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6500 ?
[02:29:15] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6500 by googol7 (2d 23h ago): iOS 7 homescreen app redirects to other page when widget gets input focus
[02:31:44] <googol7> i prepared a guide to reproduce the bug on our page - sorry for the flush:
[02:31:49] <googol7>   1. Start iOS Simulator with iPhone Retina (4-inch) and iOS 7.0 11A465
[02:31:50] <googol7>   2. Go to http://caruso.cc
[02:31:51] <googol7>   3. Save the app to your home screen ("Add to Home Screen")
[02:31:53] <googol7>   4. Start the homescreen Caruso App
[02:31:54] <googol7>   5. Press the "Login" button (you will be logged in as testuser caruso)
[02:31:56] <googol7>   6. Edit the page with Safari / Developer / iPhone Simulator / m.carusocarsharing.com
[02:31:57] <googol7>      Edit as HTML
[02:31:59] <googol7>      Add the property data-position="fixed" to the second DIV (class="nav_footer"):
[02:32:00] <googol7>      <div data-role="page" id="reservation" data-url="reservation">
[02:32:02] <googol7>          <div class="nav_footer" data-role="navbar" data-id="navigation" data-tap-toggle="false">
[02:32:03] <googol7>   7. Go to "Reservations"
[02:32:05] <googol7>   8. Click the green button on top "Reserve XYZ"
[02:32:06] <googol7>   9. Click into the select box for the end time (4th select box)
[02:32:08] <googol7>   Result: You will be redirected to the "Settings" page
[02:32:09] <googol7>   This is being executed:
[02:32:11] <googol7>   jquery.mobile-1.3.2.js
[02:32:12] <googol7>     Line: 8227
[02:32:14] <googol7> 	.bind( "focus vmouseover", function() {
[02:32:14] <googol7> 				self.button.trigger( "vmouseover" );
[02:32:15] <googol7> 			})			
[02:33:28] <uGoMobi> googol7: when we look into bugs, we always use latest code
[02:33:50] <uGoMobi> googol7: there won't be a 1.3.3
[02:35:12] <uGoMobi> googol7: why do I need to edit the HTML to reproduce?
[02:36:36] <googol7> because it's the productive site and if i'd leave data-position="fixed" in there it wouldn't work
[02:37:11] <googol7> that's how i mitigated the bug - i removed data-position="fixed" from the footer of the page "reservation"
[02:38:08] <googol7> so to test the bug - you can simple "inject" the property for testing purposes - that was my idea how to quickly show you the behaviour without building a separate test page (seems to be not so easy - tried it already)
[02:41:31] <googol7> i think you could also just inject <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/git/jquery.mobile-git.js"></script>
[02:41:36] <googol7> tried it - it's the same behaviour

[02:49:54] <googol7> can you reproduce the problem?
[02:55:39] <googol7> the problem also occurs with Google Mobile Chrome
[03:00:32] <uGoMobi> googol7: I haven't tested it yet
[03:01:06] <uGoMobi> googol7: but even when I can reproduce, we need to look at a simple test page
[03:01:25] <googol7> ok - but i'd need your assistance to build such a simple test page
[03:01:48] <uGoMobi> googol7: there is so much custom CSS in play here
[03:01:52] <googol7> got to leave now - can you try to reproduce?
[03:02:16] <googol7> you can kick out almost all CSS - this doesn't affect the problem
[03:02:43] <uGoMobi> googol7: we can assist with creating a test page
[03:03:09] <googol7> ok - are you on OS X - can you fire up the IOS sim and reproduce the bug first then?
[03:03:16] <googol7> so that you see what I mean?
[03:03:42] <uGoMobi> yes I am on OS X
[03:04:08] <uGoMobi> will give it a look
[03:04:52] <googol7> ok perfect - i'll be online later (14:00 approx.) - so see you later then

[05:42:24] <googol7> have you been able to reproduce it?
[05:43:51] <uGoMobi> googol7: yes

[05:51:31] <uGoMobi> googol7: I noticed you set data-role="navbar" for the div that you use as footer
[05:52:02] <uGoMobi> googol7: you should nest the navbar inside the footer
[05:53:13] <uGoMobi> so you have <div class="ui-footer etc"> <div class="ui-navbar"> <ul> <li> </li> </ul> </div> </div>
[05:53:34] <googol7> yes - but then i have the problem with dialog pages - then in the dialog window the footer would be placed within the dialog window and not at the bottom of the page.
[05:54:01] <googol7> i also want the navbar to stay at the bottom even when i display dialog pages
[05:54:28] <googol7> you mean like this right?
[05:54:29] <googol7> <div data-role="footer">
[05:54:29] <googol7>     <div data-role="navbar">
[05:54:30] <googol7>     </div>
[05:54:31] <googol7> </div>
[05:54:37] <uGoMobi> yup
[06:24:55] <googol7> is there a possibility to display the navbar at the bottom for a dialog page then?
[06:31:55] <googol7> but this does not cause the problem here with iOS 7 right? just tried it - doesn't make at difference for me here - even if i wrap <div data-role="footer"> around the <div data-role="navbar"> this bug occurs. can you confirm this?
[06:35:47] <uGoMobi> googol7: you asked me to assist with creating a test page for your bug report
[06:35:56] <uGoMobi> googol7: so let's focus on that
[06:36:21] <uGoMobi> googol7: you have to understand we can't debug everyone's app
[06:36:29] <googol7> ok - just wanted to exclude this as the source for the problem
[06:36:34] <googol7> yes of course
[06:37:07] <googol7> so - how do you suggest to build such a page?
[06:37:12] <uGoMobi> googol7: if you say it doesn't fix it, I don't think I will see another result
[06:37:21] <uGoMobi> googol7: take our JS Bin template
[06:38:27] <uGoMobi> googol7: create two pages with a fixed footer
[06:38:47] <uGoMobi> googol7: on the second one add the input
[06:39:35] <uGoMobi> googol7: then start testing
[06:40:06] <uGoMobi> as long as you can't reproduce keep adding things that you have in your real app
[06:41:03] <uGoMobi> and some point the bug must appear and then you know the cause
[06:41:16] <googol7> hmm - ok i'll try. by the way - if you try the same steps i described with iOS 6 the problem does not occur - so I think it's a thing with iOS 7 and jQuery Mobile and rather not my app doing something wrong - at least I'm optimistic.
[06:41:18] <googol7> ;)
[06:41:45] <googol7> do you have some vague idea where the problem could be?
[06:42:03] <uGoMobi> there are some issues with navigation and home screen apps in iOS7
[06:42:48] <uGoMobi> see also https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6494
[06:42:49] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6494 by ghost (4d 21h ago): navigation iOS 7 broken on app cache
[06:43:31] <uGoMobi> but I have no idea why it happens with an input
[06:43:42] <uGoMobi> and only one of the inputs
[06:45:22] <googol7> and also with Google Mobile Chrome - so I guess it has something to do with the Webkit rendering engine and the new iOS 7 widgets for select HTML elements.
[06:47:29] <googol7> it's not only one of the inputs - you can also do it with the third select (end date). i think it's because the native Apple IOS select widget overlaps the HTML select widgets
[06:47:42] <uGoMobi> googol7: you could also debug the other way around... copy all your markup in the JS Bin, open in Chrome, and then start deleting stuff
[06:48:19] <googol7> but the native Apple IOS select widget won't overlap the first two HTML select widgets (start date and start time) - so the problem does not occur there

[07:04:48] <didiergm> I need to use a page sometimes as a dialog sometimes as a normal page. page('destroy' exists, but not dialog('destroy'). to remove the dialog enhancement of a page, is is safe to do removeData('mobileDialog').removeData('mobilePage').unbind('vclick') on top of unwrapping the div role=dialog and removing the classes
[07:05:36] <arschmitz> didiergm: you can just link to it with data-rel="dialog" and it will be a dialog even if it has data-role page
[07:05:57] <arschmitz> didiergm: however this behavior is deprecated along with the dialog widget in 1.4 
[07:06:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how about dynamically setting option dialog in page widget?
[07:06:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was getting there :)
[07:06:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I noticed :)
[07:06:34] <didiergm> arschmitz. you are obvioulsly correct, but once a dialog, it remains a dialog and cannot be opened as a page anymore
[07:06:45] <didiergm> (ie full width etc ...)
[07:07:28] <arschmitz> didiergm: is this a dynamicly created page or one that you are cacheing or similar?
[07:07:53] <didiergm> arschmitz: a page in a multi page document
[07:07:58] <arschmitz> because unless its your inital page it is removed and will always respect the data-rel on the link that opens it
[07:08:35] <arschmitz> didiergm: sounds like a bug
[07:08:50] <arschmitz> however the dialog widget is already deprecated
[07:09:04] <arschmitz> you should use option dialog on the page widget
[07:09:38] <didiergm> I'll dig a bit more - deprecated from 1.4.x onwards or I am wrong 
[07:09:51] <didiergm> I am deploying on 1.3.2 next week
[07:10:06] <arschmitz> didiergm: ok well there wont be any more releases for 1.3
[07:10:18] <arschmitz> and what your describing sounds like a bug
[07:11:14] <didiergm> I will port to 1.4 next  but I need to deliver :( so back to my original q. Can I safely (ie w/o leaks) to a jqmRemoveData on mobileDialog and mobilePage
[07:12:03] <didiergm> I want to deliver sooner to start testing 1.4 seriously :) can't wait to use all the new goodies and enjoy the speed
[07:12:25] <arschmitz> didiergm: dialog already has an inherent memory leak by not having a proper destroy method
[07:14:16] <arschmitz> didiergm: however that being said dialog does have a destroy method
[07:14:23] <arschmitz> it just does not handle the markup changes
[07:15:06] <arschmitz> didiergm: so what you will have to do is call destroy this will destroy the widget instance but the markup will remain
[07:15:28] <didiergm> ok, that's fine then I'll take care of the markup myself :) 
[07:15:30] <didiergm> thanks 
[07:15:46] <arschmitz> didiergm: one thing you might consider to make this easier
[07:16:03] <arschmitz> is to just extend the dialog widget to add a method _destroy
[07:16:19] <arschmitz> this method is called by destroy specificly to handle things like markup changes
[07:16:40] <arschmitz> so in the _destroy method you just put your markup logic
[07:17:07] <arschmitz> and then every time you call destroy it will work as it should and handle both the markup and widget instance
[07:17:36] <didiergm> arschmitz: (very) good point I really need to get to grips with JQM internals
[07:17:52] <arschmitz> didiergm: thats actually just the normal widget factory from ui
[07:19:01] <arschmitz> didiergm: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/6714871
[07:20:31] <didiergm> arschmitz: thanks a bunch - for taking the time. It is very much appreciated
[07:20:41] <arschmitz> didiergm: no problem 
[07:48:00] <googol7> uGoMobi: ok i'll try and probably will ask you for assistance ok
[07:55:27] <scott_gonzalez> Does http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9574 make sense to other people?
[07:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> I would think that you'd want to have a visual indication if something is or isn't resizable.
[07:58:21] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so basicly they want to be able to return false on start in resizable?
[07:59:10] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't the user know that it's not resizable?
[07:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> You shouldn't have resize handles or resize cursors if you can't actually resize.
[07:59:47] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:00:17] <arschmitz> i can kinda see the use case but im not sure that is the proper way to handle it
[08:02:11] <arschmitz> it actually seems that they would want to in stop do their logic and disable the resizability of other resizeables then so they can remove the handles and show that they cant be resiazed
[08:02:21] <arschmitz> which they could do already with no modification to the widget
[08:04:19] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i mean the ability to return false on start does not seem like a bad thing however i dont think they have provided a valid use case

[12:19:21] <gnarf> if it doesn't work there it won't work on live
[12:29:31] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: amd-builder comes from https://github.com/gseguin/node-amd-builder
[12:30:13] <scott_gonzalez> But how is it getting onto jquerymobile.com?
[12:30:40] <gseguin> not sure what you mean?
[12:31:16] <gseguin>  /download-builder/ proxies to jq02.jquery.com:3100
[12:31:34] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: is that what you're asking?
[12:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> When you click the download button, the request goes to http://jquerymobile.com/amd-builder/v1/bundle/jquery/jquery-mobile/1.3.2/jquery.mobile.custom.zip

[12:33:27] <scott_gonzalez> How does that /amd-builder/ directory get on to jquerymobile.com?
[12:33:36] <gseguin> oh yeah sorry /amd-builder/ proxies to jq02.jquery.com:3100

[12:33:55] <gseguin> not /download-builder/
[12:34:29] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we just keep that proxy in place.
[12:34:41] <gseguin> yup
[12:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> So we just need to move /download-builder/ over and we're good.
[12:35:39] <gseguin> should be

[23:57:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping! http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/navigation-linking-pages/#Linknotes Is that supposed to turn into a listview?
[23:57:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we have to remove class jqm-list from that UL, because the demo code turns it into a listview if we don't.
[23:57:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good morning!
