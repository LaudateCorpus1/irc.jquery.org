[06:11:17] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping! Do you think there might be something we can do about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7539? I'm inclined to close it with my last comment on that issue.
[06:16:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I mean, I know we support Android >= 4.0 but I don't think there's much we can do about the swatch flakiness reported in that issue. I mean, if the browser doesn't correctly cascade the stylesheet, there's nothing we can do other than try to find some esoterical workaround. And AFAIK we haven't had too many reports of swatch inheritance issues ...
[06:17:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: reading
[06:19:11] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Watch the video, too. It's totally weird.
[06:34:37] <arschmitz> yeah im not sure what we could possibly do there
[06:35:39] <arschmitz> maybe some weird css hack could fix it but it would be something crazy and unrelated most likely
[06:36:26] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we could close patches welcome
[07:47:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK.

[07:52:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We don't actually have a patches welcome label. Should I make one?
[07:53:50] <arschmitz> yes
[07:57:18] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15scottgonzalez closed pull request #1270: Selectmenu: Close on scroll (06master...06selectmenu-scroll) 02http://git.io/-g7fBg
[07:57:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait. We have "help wanted", but I guess that's for easy, entry-level issues, right?
[07:57:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Not that we use it much.
[07:57:59] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or should I use it for this?
[08:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> gabriel_schulhof: Patches welcome and help wanted are very different.
[08:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> help wanted = we want to do this, it stays open, we'd like help and this is a good place to do so.
[08:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> patches welcome = we're not really concerned, we're closing this, but if someone wants to do the work, we can review it.
[08:09:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: this would be patches welcome
[08:09:55] <arschmitz> its obscure and im not worried about it 
[08:10:02] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez, arschmitz: OK. So, new label is in order.
[08:10:07] <arschmitz> yes
[08:19:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Done.

[09:58:04] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure who the touch/gesture expert(s) are, so figured I'd just show it to you and let you figure out if it's relevant for anyone :-P
[10:00:56] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: well we have vmouse that implements exacly what that talks about
[10:01:44] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and it works as well or better then any similar implementation iv tests but its true its buggy with not proper way to fix
[10:02:01] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: part of why i like the pointer events because this is not really an issue then
