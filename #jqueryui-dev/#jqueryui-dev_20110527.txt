[05:51:03] <hhillen> jzaefferer: you around?
[06:00:13] <jzaefferer> hhillen, here
[06:01:30] <hhillen> jzaefferer:  Hi, I was just updating popup based on your feed back. You suggested to use andSelf(":tabbable"), but as far as I know andSelf does not take a selector. Do you know something I don't?
[06:02:43] <hhillen> For now I fixed it with:
[06:02:48] <hhillen> if (!tabbables.length) {
[06:02:48] <hhillen> 	        	if (!this.element.is(":tabbable")) {
[06:02:48] <hhillen> 	        		this.element.attr("tabindex", "0");
[06:02:49] <hhillen> 	        	}
[06:02:49] <hhillen> 	        	tabbables.add(this.element);
[06:02:49] <hhillen> 	        }
[06:16:59] <jzaefferer> I may have taken that from the proposed features list for jQuery 1.7...
[06:17:13] <jzaefferer> so yeah, nevermind that one
[08:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> just a note that .add() is slow in IE for several versions of jQuery
[08:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> might want to look into a way to avoid using it when searching for tabbables
[08:19:02] <hhillen> scott_gonzalez: I also noticed that in ie6 :focusable (which means :tabbable) incorrectly matches <form> nodes
[08:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> hm...
[08:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> can you file a bug for that?
[08:20:41] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a ton of tests for those
[08:20:47] <hhillen> ok
[08:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> we'll need to add one for form
[08:25:02] <scott_gonzalez> can people open http://dev-test.nemikor.com/bugs/ie/select-render-add-class.html on IE 8 or 9 and let me know if the text shows up properly?
[08:25:20] <scott_gonzalez> it'll either look like http://gyazo.com/ca33a49c7a0da39d79a98d88366f62c4.png or look correct
[08:26:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: IE9 - No
[08:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it fails for me too
[08:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> showed up fine for Scott Jehl
[08:27:18] <kborchers> IE8 - Yes
[08:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...interesting
[08:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> it fails for me in both
[08:38:32] <kborchers> hmm, let me double check
[08:41:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: officially not trusting IETester anymore. IE8 in IETester on Win7 works. IE8 on VM running XP fails
[08:46:31] <kborchers> does anyone know of any inconsistencies with .scroll() in IE? seems like it may not fire as many times in IE as other browsers when scrolling the same amount.
[08:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think there's a standard for how often the event occurs
[09:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> but it should occur at least once for every scroll
[09:07:24] <kborchers> OK, it's a little strange and still trying to track the down the root of the issue so that may not be it. thanks
[09:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> working on that droppable bug?
[09:14:17] <kborchers> yep ... got a solution that works in every browser but IE. added dragStart and dragStop functions to ddmanager then call them from draggable in _mouseStart and _mouseStop.
[09:15:01] <kborchers> dragStart binds to scroll events of parents of draggable and calls prepareOffsets on each scroll then dragStop unbinds the handlers. if i skip the scroll events and just fire on every drag, works in all browsers but if bind on scroll, IE fails
[10:02:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, i think i finally figured out that droppable bug. check out https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/352 when you get a chance
[10:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> thanks, I'll check it out in a bit
[12:29:38] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master kborchers * 67bd872 (2 files in 1 dirs): Droppable: Added dragStart and dragStop to ddmanager and call them from draggable to recalculate droppable positions after a drag causes a scroll. Fixes #5003 - Scroll on Droppable Demo Breaks Demo
[12:29:38] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master Scott González * 12f73d6 (2 files in 1 dirs): Merge pull request #352 from kborchers/bug_5003_3 ...
[12:29:38] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master commits 8a972f5...12f73d6 - http://bit.ly/jV24Ht
[12:30:10] <ruprict> So, can anyone reproduce this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6847 in the master branch?  I cannot, and the reference to mozilla is gorn in the file.  (I can reproduce on jsbin, but that seems, um, not important now...)
[12:36:55] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: 1-8-stable kborchers * ce2fbb9 (2 files in 1 dirs): Droppable: Added dragStart and dragStop to ddmanager and call them from draggable to recalculate droppable positions after a drag causes a scroll. Fixes #5003 - Scroll on Droppable Demo Breaks Demo ... - http://bit.ly/kGJ6zA
[12:40:09] <rworth> ruprict: have a link to the jsbin repro?
[12:41:47] <rworth> caus you can point jsbin at anything, including master and any tag and any specific commit
[12:42:03] <ruprict> ooo..you can?
[12:42:10] <ruprict> I am not knowing…hold pls...
[12:42:26] <ruprict> http://jsbin.com/emazu3/edit
[12:42:50] <rworth> using urls like http://view.jqueryui.com/master/ui/jquery.ui.core.js and http://view.jqueryui.com/1.8.13/ui/jquery.ui.core.js and http://view.jqueryui.com/12f73d6/ui/jquery.ui.core.js
[12:42:58] <ruprict> Oh, dug
[12:42:58] <rworth> note the sha1 in that last url
[12:43:13] <ruprict> I mean, duh
[12:43:17] <rworth> it means grabbing each file, core, widget, datepicker
[12:43:30] <rworth> but you can basically bisect
[12:43:43] <rworth> even if a bit manually
[12:43:52] <rworth> or you could always git bisect
[12:44:09] <ruprict> Yup, I'll set it up and if it is fixed there, I'll just add it to the bug….thanks
[12:44:27] <rworth> if it's fixed in master just walk back and find where it was fixed
[12:45:20] <ruprict> I'll give it a shot.
[12:45:28] <rworth> then it should be easy to see whether it's been fixed in 1-8-stable as well
[12:54:09] <ruprict> Yup, found the commit.
[12:54:20] <ruprict> Thanks for the info.  I learned today, which means it was good.
[12:54:23] <rworth> :)
[12:54:28] <ruprict> Just put that info on the bug?
[12:54:38] <rworth> can you see whether it was merged to 1-8-stable as well as master?
[12:55:09] <ruprict> So, how does one know/find that?
[12:55:10] <rworth> If so we can close the bug as of the correct 1.8.x version number, otherwise we'll take a look at why not, and whether it can be merged to 1-8-stable (not everything can)
[12:55:38] <rworth> easiest first step is test with a view..... /1.8.13/ url or /1-8-stable/ url
[12:55:48] <rworth> first would reference a tag, second a branch
[12:56:10] <ruprict> Ah, so, I can't search the commits for a branch?
[12:56:22] <rworth> you can do that as well
[12:56:37] <rworth> through github web interface you can select the 1-8-stable branch
[12:56:41] <rworth> click on the datepicker file
[12:56:47] <rworth> look and see if the fix is there
[12:56:58] <rworth> also you can click on history and see all the recent commits to that file
[12:57:10] <rworth> looking around or soon after the one done in master would make sense
[12:59:09] <ruprict> Yup, it's in the 1.8-stable blame list (that right?)
[12:59:45] <ruprict> So, now am I prepared to update the bug? (he says, um sheepishly)
[13:00:54] <rworth> when was it fixed in 1-8-stable
[13:01:12] <rworth> before which 1.8.x release?
[13:02:03] <ruprict> patch was made on 5/12
[13:02:09] <ruprict> So, that has to be 1.8.13?
[13:02:54] <ruprict> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/10fa7f9ae9ea68ac11795862a2ccdc813256eb8e
[13:02:56] <ruprict> there's the commit
[13:03:12] <ruprict> brb….rest stop….(tmi)
[13:06:24] <rworth> yeah that commit fixed #7322 which has is set to version 1.8.12. So, is this ticket a duplicate, or did the one commit fix both tickets?
[13:06:59] <rworth> that commit fixed #7322 which has is set to version 1.8.12. So, is this ticket a duplicate, or did the one commit fix both tickets?
[13:08:27] <ruprict> It's a dup
[13:08:39] <ruprict> So, I can mark as such….
[13:08:53] <rworth> ok
[13:09:07] <ruprict> Long way home there…..thanks for the help/patience.
[13:09:25] <rworth> oh no problem at all, thanks for your contribution :)
[13:09:39] <rworth> saw your button pull request the other day
[13:09:56] <rworth> Scott ended up getting back to you on it before me, but glad to see we got it landed
[13:11:17] <ruprict> Yup, first time…hope to do tons more.
[13:11:39] <ruprict> Put comment on bug, wife says I have to drive now….enjoy the holiday weekend (for those of you that get one)
[13:11:58] * gnarf waves
[13:13:08] <gnarf> rworth: hows the end of rewardjs goin?
[13:13:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: could you take a look at this commit and let me know how on earth IE would add an extra row to the datepicker and all other browsers work correctly. may be something simple but i don't see it. https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/1d984e76b79bfeda15eff392e06d8ed0eab72333
[13:15:25] <rworth> gnarf: pretty well, I think we were up to 55 PRs, now it looks like 43, so still a lot on the team's plate, but that's a good problem to have, and certainly beats no/less activity
[13:15:43] <gnarf> rworth: aye, i think it was effective :)
[13:15:53] <rworth> I'm happy
[13:16:18] <rworth> I've got a bunch of numbers I want to run, but I have a feeling we involved maybe 20 or so new-time contributors
[13:16:23] <gnarf> wish I had more pulls this month, but its been busy for me movin and all :)
[13:16:24] <rworth> in a few short weeks
[13:17:04] <rworth> and I'm hopeful that will continue, I mean sure the level and number of individuals will go down, but even if one new person continues to make a significant contribution, that's a success in my book
[13:17:16] * gnarf nods
[13:17:50] <rworth> aside from the actual work completed in May, as well as what we were able to learn about how much work there is, how long it takes, what it takes, and how we can more easily help people help us with it
[13:18:18] <gnarf> I got to the point where I was just trying to help close pulls instead of making new ones :)
[13:18:44] <rworth> gnarf: I certainly am glad you've been able to help with the reviews as well, that's a big area we need to add more qualified people to
[13:19:20] <rworth> especially if we continue with this kind of momentum. We knew we had bottlenecks, but now we have a good feel for it, and I think that would be harder to see without this pressure
[13:19:57] <rworth> not that we couldn't see it was there, but to quantify it
[13:20:13] <rworth> much like the difficulty in quantifying the amount of work that is a pile of 800 tickets
[13:20:19] <gnarf> :)
[13:20:29] <rworth> we only have a sampling, but it's a much bigger sample than before
[13:20:36] <rworth> so I hope it can help
[13:20:43] <gnarf> same
[13:20:59] <gnarf> so, i think its kinda awesome rewardjs ends on my brithday
[13:21:00] <gnarf> )
[13:21:07] <rworth> oh sweet
[13:21:08] <rworth> tomorrow?
[13:21:16] <gnarf> today
[13:21:23] <rworth> oh, there's still tomorrow
[13:21:27] <rworth> but Happy Birthday!
[13:21:38] <gnarf> i suppose ;) -- end of the "daily prizes"
[13:21:43] <rworth> bugs closed Sat still coun't for top week 4 and top month
[13:21:48] <rworth> yeah, today is the last daily prize
[13:21:54] <rworth> speaking of, seems I forgot to announce it
[13:22:09] * gnarf shakes a finger @rworth
[13:22:36] <gnarf> have I gotten a bug fixed this week yet?
[13:22:43] <gnarf> i think i got one the other 3 weeks
[13:22:54] <gnarf> my goal was the weekly prizes ;)
[13:23:01] <rworth> not this week
[13:23:11] <gnarf> although I ended up with a PSP, that was kinda cool
[13:23:13] <rworth> there were far fewer, through no fault of trying
[13:23:23] <rworth> cool
[13:23:48] <gnarf> rworth: do you see blog.jquery.com drafts?
[13:23:51] <rworth> I know it's not a perfect system, and that showed this week, with PRs piling up
[13:24:22] <rworth> but I think overall it was free of catastrophic bugs
[13:24:30] <rworth> I can, should I look?
[13:25:03] <gnarf> yeah -- Got a draft for jQuery Color beta
[13:25:12] <rworth> nice
[13:25:14] * rworth looks
[13:25:58] <mandragorn> how do you do the action thing in place of a message?
[13:26:13] <gnarf> huh?
[13:26:14] <mandragorn> not used to IRC
[13:26:18] <mandragorn> (04:25:14 PM) ***rworth looks
[13:26:22] <gnarf>  /me  in most clients
[13:26:28] * mandragorn tries it.
[13:26:30] <mandragorn> nice
[13:26:43] <rworth> gnarf: looks great
[13:26:50] <rworth> why cap c on $.Color ?
[13:26:58] <mandragorn> sorry I'm just evesdropping while I wait for stuff to build at work.
[13:27:04] <gnarf> rworth: because it makes a new object, like $.Event or $.Deferred
[13:27:05] <rworth> no worries
[13:27:28] <rworth> figured it was that, but I was coming up with other examples, like jQuery ;)
[13:27:40] <rworth> and .dialog
[13:27:57] <rworth> but sure
[13:28:27] <gnarf> rworth: did the blog post make you wanna read the README ?
[13:28:40] <rworth> fosho
[13:29:44] <rworth> partial colors, that's wicked
[13:30:29] <gnarf> rworth: yeah, i noticed while writing that blog up that I probably shoulda added support straight to the cssHook for that , but currently it only works in animate
[13:30:56] <rworth> nothing like writing documentation to help you find bugs
[13:31:54] <gnarf> bug / feature
[13:32:00] <gnarf> that one is kinda both
[13:32:31] <mandragorn> where do you access the blog.jquery.com drafts thing you were talking about... need something to burn more time while I wait for more stuff to commit.
[13:32:33] <rworth> can othercolor be anything $.Color accepts?
[13:32:44] <gnarf> rworth: for transition?
[13:32:48] <rworth> yeah
[13:32:54] <rworth> and in general
[13:32:54] <gnarf> i think so, but it might need to be a color
[13:32:56] <gnarf> lemme check
[13:33:06] <rworth> would be cool to be friendly like that
[13:33:08] <gnarf> on .is / .blend i know i added support for parser
[13:33:35] <gnarf> yup:
[13:33:38] <gnarf> 		transition: function( other, distance ) {
[13:33:38] <gnarf> 			var end = color( other ),
[13:33:45] <rworth> nice
[13:34:00] <rworth> mandragorn: check out https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[13:34:07] <rworth> the README
[13:34:52] <gnarf> mandragorn: i have a screenshot of the draft blog if you wanna read over it
[13:35:01] <mandragorn> sure
[13:35:14] <gnarf> http://www.cl.ly/0a342B2S0s0s0R3c2d0Z
[13:35:46] <gnarf> rworth: if i coulda landed color today, I could solve 6 bugs
[13:36:15] <rworth> that would've been some birthday present
[13:36:29] <gnarf> http://bitly.com/jqui-color-bugs
[13:37:19] <gnarf> and I added a ton of features that aren't even listed there :)
[13:37:46] <gnarf> gotta give danheberden the props for helping with the api design too...
[13:37:57] <gnarf> its pretty damn sexy, cuz danheberden is sexy ;)
[13:38:07] <rworth> so is
[13:38:18] * rworth didn't specify which
[13:39:02] <gnarf> so's your face?
[13:39:40] <rworth> kborchers: Scott says he's not sure what's up with IE (thunderstorm and his power flashed so he's offline now)
[13:42:31] <rworth> gnarf: danheberden thinks so
[13:43:00] <kborchers> rworth: thanks ... yeah, it's really weird
[13:50:37] <gnarf> kborchers: wish I felt like debugging, i'd try to help
[13:50:44] <gnarf> I just wanna be lazy today
[13:50:47] <gnarf> :)
[13:51:35] <kborchers> gnarf: no problem, moved to something else to ease the frustration but getting frustrated at the new thing now ;)
[13:54:34] <danheberden> and yes, i have said that about rworth
[14:10:48] <gnarf> danheberden:  ;)
[14:10:56] <gnarf> danheberden: why do you have your @ showing?
[14:11:21] <danheberden> hmm, oh - probably wheni changed the topic
[14:11:33] <danheberden> there we go
[14:12:08] <gnarf> ;)
[14:12:14] <gnarf> catch u guys later prolly
[14:14:08] <mandragorn> been reading https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color inbetween things and found a typo (very minor), who/where should I tell about it?
[14:14:55] <gnarf> mandragorn: pull request? :)
[14:15:32] <gnarf> or i can fix it quick
[14:15:48] <gnarf> i need to make another readme change anyway i thik
[14:16:29] <mandragorn> gnarf: a bit new... probably better if you fix it...
[14:16:29] <mandragorn> JQuery.Color properties
[14:16:29] <mandragorn> Internals on the Color Object
[14:16:29] <mandragorn> ...
[14:16:29] <mandragorn> "transparent"
[14:16:29] <mandragorn> the next line has greed instead of green.
[14:16:38] <danheberden> haha
[14:16:50] <gnarf> heh
[14:16:54] <mandragorn> :)
[14:17:01] <danheberden> synonymous
[14:17:30] <gnarf> mandragorn: whats your github user? :)
[14:17:31] <danheberden> gnarf i might have improvedthe color compression, btw
[14:17:35] <danheberden> still need to work through the demo
[14:17:41] <mandragorn> jyoung I think
[14:18:00] <danheberden> mandragorn you could do a quick online pull req on github
[14:18:06] <danheberden> that way, its your commit getting merged
[14:18:24] <gnarf> https://github.com/jyoung?
[14:18:34] <mandragorn> give me some commands/urls, not familiar with github ui yet.
[14:18:52] <mandragorn> err, no
[14:18:53] <gnarf> mandragorn: there should be an "EDIT" link if you look at the README.md source
[14:19:16] <gnarf> mandragorn: http://cl.ly/0s023F1o3m1B0G1m1J3k
[14:19:29] <gnarf> upper right of that screanshot :)
[14:19:29] <mandragorn> I'm mandragorn on github to... somewhere I used jyoung to register :)
[14:20:09] <gnarf> well i got the fix here already anyway, i'll just mention you in the commit ;)
[14:21:27] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/commits/master
[14:23:18] <mandragorn> thanks a bit out of sorts here, I'm working from my company's main office instead of from home like I normally do, so when I go out of the office to relax I don't have reliable computer access as I would at home :).
[14:24:51] <mandragorn> next week I'll be back home and I'll spend a night figuring out the various stuff around jquery-ui dev.
[14:25:33] <gnarf> hehe
[14:25:49] <gnarf> i just got bored and katamari hacked the jquery-color qunit test suite
[14:25:58] <gnarf> that was quite theraputic
[14:26:08] <mandragorn> nice
[14:42:47] <mandragorn>  /sigh I wish my company had used jquery instead of prototype/scriptaculous 5 years ago when these projects started... such a pain to use now when I have to implement this functionality that I know jquery has out-of-the-box.
