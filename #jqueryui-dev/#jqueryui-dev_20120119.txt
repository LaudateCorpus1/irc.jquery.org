[12:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> Problem #1: You can't spell jQuery... http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8030
[12:48:55] <clarkbox> hey scott_gonzalez... what do you think of this pull req https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/578 ?
[12:48:56] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by clarkbox (19h, 37m ago): make the postion of popup dynamic
[12:50:19] <scott_gonzalez> not sure, I haven't used popup at all
[12:53:08] <scott_gonzalez> seems fine
[12:53:30] <scott_gonzalez> of course this is after just a quick glance at how popup works.
[12:53:45] <clarkbox> ya.. its the only way to get a single popup to attache to multiple targets
[12:53:55] <clarkbox> EG, a context menu within a grid
[12:54:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that use case seems reasonable.
[12:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> Although we should find out if there are any accessibility concerns with many elements owning the same element
[12:55:03] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't think there would be, but you never know.
[12:55:05] <clarkbox> ya
[12:55:20] <clarkbox> its one of those fixes that is too simple... i feel like im missing something
[12:55:33] <clarkbox> who created popup() ?
[12:56:28] <scott_gonzalez> I believe jzaefferer, but it may have been Hans Hillen.
[12:56:51] <scott_gonzalez> Either way, jzaefferer would have plenty of knowledge about it.
[12:56:59] <clarkbox> k, ill check with Jörn
[12:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> I think kborchers has also worked with it.
[12:57:53] <kborchers> very little ... it has been on my list but have been bogged down in client work :(
[12:59:20] <kborchers> scope creep makes me want to change professions
[12:59:39] <clarkbox> i LOVE to HATE clients!
[12:59:53] <kborchers> heh
[13:00:26] <clarkbox> that why i got out of client services, and switched to product development. its slightly better :)
[13:24:46] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: commented on the PR
[13:25:37] <clarkbox> k thanks
[13:25:38] <clarkbox> will reply
[13:25:41] <clarkbox> i see your point
[13:25:59] <clarkbox> will need to handle the case where it is opened without passing an event
[13:26:48] <jzaefferer> well, thats less of a concern compared to the second issue
[13:28:10] <clarkbox> im not sure i follow?
[13:28:31] <clarkbox> you would still call popup() on the popup element
[13:28:43] <clarkbox> but the target selector could have multiple matches
[13:29:05] <clarkbox> im not sure of the implications of having multiple matches for the popup selector...
[13:29:18] <clarkbox> but it shouldnt be a problem
[13:29:21] <clarkbox> i will test that
[13:34:04] <jzaefferer> oh, right, trigger: ".alllMyTriggers"
[13:34:13] <jzaefferer> yeah, a test and demo for that would help
[13:36:38] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, kborchers, too, can you take a look at this? http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#combobox
[13:36:56] <jzaefferer> on the one hand, is combobox the right role for our selectmenu?
[13:37:20] <jzaefferer> on the other, are those three bullet points of any use for our autocomplete implementation?
[13:37:44] <kborchers> jzaefferer: if selectemenu doesn't have type ahead, i would say no
[13:37:54] <kborchers> seems confusing
[13:37:57] <scott_gonzalez> no, selectmenu is not a combobox
[13:38:30] <jzaefferer> "The combobox may be editable." <- selectmenu is a combobox without text input?
[13:39:15] <jzaefferer> listbox is the only other role that comes into question, as far as I can tell
[13:39:26] <jzaefferer> and listbox description contains this: "if there is a valid reason to expand the listbox, the combobox role may be more appropriate"
[13:39:50] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...maybe a noneditable combobox is correct, but it seems strange
[13:40:05] <jzaefferer> there's "select", but that is abstract, so we can't use it
[13:40:14] <kborchers> could it just be menu?
[13:40:45] <jzaefferer> according to the example, selectmenu should consist of an element with role=combobox, aria-autocomplete=none and a associated role=listbox
[13:40:45] <kborchers> it is using menu after all and that seems to fit http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#menu
[13:41:02] <scott_gonzalez> intereseting
[13:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> menu seems like it would confuse users
[13:41:35] <jzaefferer> kborchers: "A menu is often a list of common actions or functions that the user can invoke."
[13:41:42] <jzaefferer> selectmenu is an input element
[13:41:48] <jzaefferer> which menu isn't
[13:41:53] <kborchers> yeah ... you're right
[13:43:55] <jzaefferer> let's give combobox a try..
[13:44:36] <jzaefferer> kborchers: could you take a look at Felix' last update? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/492#issuecomment-3485169
[13:44:37] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by fnagel (3m, 1w ago): Selectmenu: Code review
[13:45:52] <kborchers> i can take a look later this evening
[13:52:24] <jzaefferer> thanks

[15:17:03] <sehh> hey people
[15:17:19] <sehh> anyone noticed that there is a bug with UI button checkboxes and the .change() event? apparently if you double click on a checkbox button, the .change() event reports the wrong status!
[15:18:13] <sehh> for example, if i click on a checkbox UI button, the .change() even alerts me for the result of the $(this).is(":checked");
[15:18:34] <sehh> so .is(":checked") correctly returns true or false
[15:19:15] <sehh> but when I double click, the .is(":checked") is now reporting the wrong value
[15:20:10] <sehh> after doing some testing, I figured out that the UI button and the real <input> tag are NOT synchronized!
[15:29:27] <clarkbox> sehh can you link us to a jsfiddle demonstrating this bug?
[15:53:11] <sehh> back
[15:53:14] <sehh> sorry for the delay
[15:53:28] <sehh> I found other people with the same bug:
[15:53:29] <sehh> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/ui-button-checkbox-doubleclick-problem-on-firefox
[15:53:50] <sehh> what is hsfiddle?
[15:56:48] <sehh> ok got jsfiddle working, i'm trying to copy/paste some working code for you to test
[16:05:39] <sehh> hmm
[16:05:50] <sehh> I can't seem to be able to load the UI in jsfiddle
[16:05:58] <sehh> jQuery is working fine
[16:06:11] <sehh> but calling the .button() function isn't doing anything
[16:08:27] <clarkbox> whats the jsfiddle url?
[16:12:26] <sehh> here: http://jsfiddle.net/vURZB/1/
[16:15:28] <sehh> hmm
[16:15:32] <sehh> happens in IE9 as well
[16:16:47] <sehh> oh weird, IE8 works fine and doesn't cause the bug to appear!?!
[16:18:14] <sehh> IE7 works fine as well
[16:19:23] <sehh> hmmm
[16:19:35] <sehh> works: IE7, IE8, Chrome
[16:19:43] <sehh> broken: Firefox, IE9
[16:21:04] <sehh> (also works fine in Safari for windows)
[16:21:32] <sehh> sounds about right, since Safari and Chrome are based on the same engine
[16:22:06] <sehh> interestingly, while older IE work fine, IE9 is broken...

[19:52:51] <clarkbox> hypothetically... what should happen when a user clicks to open a context menu, then immediately clicks on an adjacent context menu...
[19:53:04] <clarkbox> should the second menu open
[19:53:13] <clarkbox> or will it just cause the first menu to close?
