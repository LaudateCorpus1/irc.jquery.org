[00:30:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/159
[00:42:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You spoke to Changsuk about discussing the 1.5 roadmap with his team ... can we set up a #web-ui-fw to do that? One day at 09:00 your time should be fine ... I told them I'd let them know via email after talking to you about it.
[00:44:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure
[00:44:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So what time would be good?
[00:44:22] <_|Nix|_> I mean what day ...
[00:44:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's discuss the roadmap with Mobile team first
[00:45:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, and we would be discussing that next Thursday, right?
[00:45:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can do that during next weeks Mobile meeting
[00:45:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[00:45:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, in that case we can do another Friday morning meeting after that, right?
[00:45:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you type faster than me... was about to say that :)
[00:45:52] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[00:45:55] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[00:46:00] <_|Nix|_> I'll let them know.
[00:46:02] * uGoMobi checking his calendar
[00:46:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Friday Dec 6, 9am is fine by me 
[00:53:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can we make it the Monday after? Friday is a day off for me (Independence day here in Finland).
[00:54:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah that's OK
[00:54:24] <_|Nix|_> Excellent! Thanks!
[01:12:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I merged 1.4-update in master yesterday
[01:12:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I forgot to delete the branch
[01:12:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I already merged your last commit in master locally
[01:14:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK. I'll continue working on master.
[01:15:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can you please push that change?
[01:15:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was about to
[01:15:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: My master still shows that commit as appearing only on 1.4-update
[01:16:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[01:16:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for some reason I get an empty page when I now look at the TR local
[01:16:43] <_|Nix|_> K, weird ...
[01:16:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that was already before your commit
[01:17:09] <uGoMobi> just wanted to check a change I want to commit
[01:17:57] <_|Nix|_> Have we not changed the corner radii a single time since 1.0 (aside from 1.4)?
[01:22:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I pushed your change to master
[01:22:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, we never changed it before
[01:23:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so this will be a super-special case: only discard radii when downgrading from 1.4.
[01:25:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can delete branch 1.4-update ...
[01:25:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, go ahead

[02:16:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/159 is fixed.
[02:17:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... by discarding corner radii when downgrading from >= 1.4 to < 1.4
[02:18:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: awesome
[02:19:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looks good, I'll deploy again
[02:20:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh wait
[02:20:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that seems to work two ways
[02:21:33] <uGoMobi> so if you go back from 1.3 to 1.4 you still have 1.3 corner radii
[02:21:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we talked about that already
[02:22:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when you upgrade from 1.3 to 1.4 we should not change corner radii
[02:23:46] <uGoMobi> it was just that when you play around and switch between versions without making changes, you'll expect the corner radii to be updated
[02:23:59] <uGoMobi> but let's not make it more complicated
[02:36:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ...
