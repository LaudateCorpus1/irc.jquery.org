[07:29:31] <_zoggy_> your favorite sites and shortcuts, you get more of your favorite content faster and easier.
[07:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I'm back.
[07:33:14] <DaveMethvin> yaay!
[07:33:30] <DaveMethvin> so on the touch events
[07:33:55] <DaveMethvin> when we talked at the summit it seemed like the best first step would be to make a plugin
[07:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:34:14] <DaveMethvin> that devs would use to handle "pointer" events and we'd map mouse and touch to that
[07:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:34:43] <DaveMethvin> so that's a pretty big change to user's code, i can see us adding it to core eventually but start with the plugin
[07:34:50] <scott_gonzalez> Starting with a plugin gives us the ability to work on it separately from any other release schedule.
[07:34:55] <DaveMethvin> right
[07:35:38] <DaveMethvin> it seems like a first shot at this shouldn't be too hard (famous last words)
[07:35:46] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:36:04] <DaveMethvin> we need to find a sucker, erm, person to do this
[07:36:08] <DaveMethvin> :D
[07:36:22] <scott_gonzalez> The question is how much care we want to put into making mouse + pointer useful at the same time.
[07:36:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:36:54] <DaveMethvin> that may be a must-have if people want touse their existing plugins etc
[07:36:57] <scott_gonzalez> For instance, do we want to implement the full pointer API or completely ignore the parts where you can control mouse events from pointer events.
[07:37:20] <DaveMethvin> sorry but i have to run off for about 30 minutes to walk the dog
[07:37:37] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:41:35] <scott_gonzalez> Opera 12.1, huh? Does that mean we're dropping 11.6?

[08:13:16] <rxaviers> ben_alman, hello mr cowboy
[08:13:47] <rxaviers> how is it going? I have a question for you on something I was wondering on grunt
[08:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: #grunt might be a better place to ask that question
[08:16:11] <rxaviers> aha! true
[08:20:43] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: ok where were we ... oh yeah, a plugin for the pointer api
[08:21:14] <DaveMethvin> i can reply to jacob ... dunno if we want to give a time frame for that
[08:21:19] <DaveMethvin> seems like a next year thing
[08:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I can't really focus on it until after 1.10.
[08:23:12] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd like to move quickly on it.
[08:23:15] <DaveMethvin> and we have 1.9 and 2.0 to ship
[08:23:25] <DaveMethvin> but if there was a willing volunteer, perhaps?
[08:23:32] <scott_gonzalez> Well, UI 1.10 is gonna happen quickly.
[08:23:49] <DaveMethvin> you want to tackle it yourself?
[08:24:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'd definitely accept help :-)
[08:24:07] <DaveMethvin> haha
[08:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> There's that guy who wrote that other polyfill.
[08:24:22] <DaveMethvin> i am sure there's a lot of input to be gathered on it
[08:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> He said he'd be willing to help.
[08:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> I should ping Doug Schepers about getting together for lunch and talk to him about it too.
[08:25:08] <DaveMethvin> having someone focused and invested in it might be really helpful
[08:25:26] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think he'll write any code, but he'll probably have good feedback about what we should and shouldn't try to implement.
[08:25:44] <DaveMethvin> definitely a lot of pitfalls for a full implementation
[08:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:25:55] <DaveMethvin> especially if mouse and touch get to peek through
[08:26:51] <DaveMethvin> ok then, so what should we tell jacob?
[08:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> Let's tell him that I'll be representing jQuery in the Pointer Events WG.
[08:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> And we'll be building a plugin for pointer events.
[08:28:41] <DaveMethvin> sounds like a sufficiently modest goal, we can do it!
[08:29:04] <scott_gonzalez> We don't know exactly what portions of the API we'll build, in terms of exposing the ability to control mouse events via pointer events, etc.
[08:29:11] <scott_gonzalez> But we'll definitely be mapping mouse + touch to pointer.
[08:29:25] <scott_gonzalez> With the goal of having developers completely move away from using mouse and touch events.
[08:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> And the plan is to eventually move the plugin into jQuery core.
[08:29:54] <scott_gonzalez> But we don't know how early that can happen.
[08:30:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah i would think pointer wouldn't go into jQuery core until the next major release which is probably something like Jan 2014
[08:30:37] <DaveMethvin> but the plugin could be used before that
[08:32:43] <scott_gonzalez> Seems reasonable.
[08:36:54] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: gnarf nacin are any of you by chance around to help with https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/125
[08:37:49] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: very limited; what's with the content currently in the brand.jquery.org repo? going to throw that out?
[08:38:07] <ajpiano> right now the gh-pages branch is going to be left alone
[08:38:28] <ajpiano> eventualyl the index.html in gh-pages will make its way into the page/ directory of master
[08:39:00] <jzaefferer> okay, so we create the content repo in master?
[08:39:12] <ajpiano> yep
[08:40:52] <jzaefferer> this will be a completely new theme? or will it reuse an existing body class? like "jquery-project"
[08:40:54] <ajpiano> and on the web-base-template end, i suppose i would just add site 17 into the array here: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/sites.php and hm
[08:41:04] <ajpiano> it's going to reuse jquery-project
[08:41:38] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:41:43] <jzaefferer> static index page plugin, right?
[08:41:45] <ajpiano> that may change but it's certainly ok for now
[08:41:46] <ajpiano> yessir
[08:41:59] <jzaefferer> blogname: "jQuery Brand"?
[08:42:27] <nacin> why wouldn't the brand site just be an extension of jquery.org, like jquery.org/brand?
[08:43:27] <ajpiano> jQuery Branding Guidelines
[08:43:51] <ajpiano> nacin: it needs to have different header navigation, may end up with a different colour than .org etc
[08:44:25] <ajpiano> we're working with an external vendor on this and i wanted to give them a cleaner box to work in than the existing jquery.org content
[08:51:34] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: we can make that and still have it under jquery.org/brand, see api.jqueryui.com/1.8, which is blog_id 17
[08:51:38] <jzaefferer> so 18 must come next
[08:57:06] <ajpiano> aha
[08:57:31] <ajpiano> i have been planning to go with brand.jquery.org for several weeks now
[08:58:09] <ajpiano> though i suppose it is a bit "heavy" for a subdomain
[08:58:39] <ajpiano> i don't really care too much either way, i mostly just want to get it set up so i can give them a place to be productive
[08:59:15] <ajpiano> would we rename the brand.jquery.org repo?
[09:13:31] <ajpiano> jzaefferer/nacin i'm heading to vote, do you need anything from me or are you on it?
[09:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Check out the craziness on this PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/803

[13:54:16] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer so this was merged because there are other places already using .bind? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/806 that was the reason i hadn't merged it because scott_gonzalez had asked to change to ._on ‚Ä¶ seems like we should have had it fixed before merging but i guess they can just all be fixed together
[13:56:20] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally we don't add to the pile.
[13:56:32] <kborchers> that's what i thought
[14:00:16] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: how do you do this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/menubar/ui/jquery.ui.menubar.js#L93 with ._on since a space indicates a selector for delegation, right?
[14:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> Create a function for it and then do { click: "fn", focus: "fn", mouseenter: "fn" }
[14:01:19] <kborchers> ah, duh. thanks
[14:39:04] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: nacin any headway on the new site install/theme? gnarf's around and said he can help, and i can also work on it tonight
[14:39:14] <ajpiano> i just need to get it stood up so i can onboard their devs
[14:49:44] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: I can't do anything tonight
[14:50:09] <ajpiano> ok
[14:50:32] <jzaefferer> kborchers scott_gonzalez: Scott asked for the _on change, that didn't happen for a while, so I landed it to fix the bigger issue.
[14:52:31] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: No CLA?
[14:52:42] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I forgot about that
[14:53:06] <jzaefferer> I don't think I've asked for it at all so far, need to get used to that
[14:53:56] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: can you make sense of this‚Ä¶ it was filed by paul, so it means something, but I don't know the practical effect: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5322
[14:54:13] <scott_gonzalez> And no tests?
[14:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: hmm...
[14:56:19] <mikesherov> hmmm is right
[14:59:46] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I'm not sure what set of conditions triggers the bug he's talkinga bout.
[15:00:33] <scott_gonzalez> Considering it's 3 years old and has 0 comments, I'd kick it back to him :-P
[15:04:19] <mikesherov> ok
[15:04:28] <mikesherov> give hum the ol' pending
