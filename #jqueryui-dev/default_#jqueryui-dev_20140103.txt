[00:27:39] <Krikke> hey, I saw jqm 1.4 was released, is there a changelog between rc1 and stable?
[00:42:43] <uGoMobi> Krikke: no changes in the library between rc1 and stable, only in demos, build scripts etc.
[00:49:10] <Krikke> ah okay, thanks!
[00:49:39] <Krikke> probably why git renamed the file :D

[05:23:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping! Hey! Do you remember why you added https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/41cffcb6da28c4c06b586cff998d313b2a0e71d1 ? If you do, could you please answer arschmitz here (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6820#discussion_r8522024)?
[05:24:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey
[05:24:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Basically, you added the code that closes the panel when you click on a data-ajax=false link inside of it.
[05:24:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: arschmitz Wonders why that's necessary when we're going to be destroyed via an HTTP request anyway.
[05:24:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does it look bad when the user clicks "Back"?
[05:26:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Come to think of it, reacting to data-ajax=false may not be enough. If we must close the panel, maybe we should do so upon "unload".
[05:26:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, you could have <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> and that has no data-ajax="false", and yet it does an HTTP request.
[05:27:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I thought there was an issue with this, but I did not refer to a ticket. Trying to find it now.
[05:27:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Thanks!
[05:30:39] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15ryakh opened pull request #1158: Event match changed to match events that contain any character excluding... (06master...06master) 02http://git.io/IpdX6g
[05:34:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1083 does not trigger the close because the link does not have data-ajax="false", yet it looks OK.
[05:35:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: At least, it looks OK on desktop FF and Chrome ...
[05:38:23] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#1153 (master - d8375b7 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build passed.
[05:38:23] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/143bdae2c979...d8375b7bd86c
[05:38:23] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/16314242
[05:40:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: all I can think of is that this code makes sure the panel is closed when you nav back
[05:41:57] <uGoMobi> good example of why we should always open issue tickets when we fix a problem
[05:43:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess there must've been a platform where that was an issue.
[05:43:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the way nav works with things like popups and panels there is no way to go back to a page with a panel open after a full page reload ( ajax=false )
[05:44:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's right, but panels have no history, so there's no dialog state to skip over.
[05:44:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, the page does seem to get reloaded upon clicking "Back".
[05:45:17] <arschmitz> right which means you can naver go back to a page and have the panel still open
[05:45:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... unless the DOM changes introduced by the panel are preserved by the browser.
[05:45:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... for some (buggy?) reason.
[05:46:27] <arschmitz> well since browsers dont work that way i would need to see this actually reproduced somewhere
[05:46:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IINM the popup explicitly closes when the user navigates to another page - AJAX or not. Lemme double-check that.
[05:47:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and that's the problem. I'm sure uGoMobi had this up and running at some point ... 
[05:49:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ : actually I think I only did this so you'll see the panel closing before navigating to the new page
[05:49:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I see ... 
[05:49:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: To get the outgoing transition.
[05:49:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I'd say that's a valid reason.
[05:49:35] <uGoMobi> the nav back doesn't make sense
[05:49:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Although it adds additional complexity.
[05:50:04] <_|Nix|_> However, it does provide a nice transition before the HTTP request clobbers the whole state.
[05:50:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure it does make sense to have panel close just for the transition
[05:50:19] <arschmitz> its not like its a page transition
[05:50:21] <uGoMobi> compare this http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1084 with http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1083 
[05:51:14] <arschmitz> personally i think no transition is better but thats just my opinion
[05:51:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I guess it's a subjective call. Do we want the nice closing transition before we navigate away or not?
[05:51:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I tend to agree, but only because it's programmatically easier.
[05:51:58] <_|Nix|_> My sense of aesthetics === undefined
[05:52:43] <arschmitz> we dont do this anywhere else 
[05:52:49] <arschmitz> popups dont close
[05:52:58] <arschmitz> and there is no exit transition for pages
[05:53:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Popups do close when you go to an AJAX page.
[05:53:15] <arschmitz> so i think its weird to do it just for panels 
[05:53:19] <arschmitz> right
[05:53:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, wait, they don't. I actually abort the transition.
[05:53:28] <arschmitz> but thats not what we are talking about
[05:53:34] <arschmitz> this is non ajax specific
[05:53:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I can live with removing the transition here
[05:54:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: yeah, popups do a "Oh, shit! Get outta the way! There's an incoming page!" transition :)
[05:54:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool i think its consistant with the rest of the lib and reduces complexity
[05:55:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, then I'll remove that as part of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6820
[05:55:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll make it a separate commit.
[05:55:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I do think it looks a bit better with transition, but I find reducing complexity and consistency more important
[05:55:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, this can be done as a demo.
[05:55:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah make it its own commit
[05:55:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You could do it upon unload.
[05:55:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: wait
[05:56:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz: isn't this something that has to wait until 1.5?
[05:56:27] <uGoMobi> master = 1.4.1 pre
[05:57:10] <arschmitz> was it like this in 1.3
[05:57:27] <uGoMobi> yes, it was added before 1.3.0
[05:57:53] <uGoMobi> does removing this part of the code fix a bug?
[05:58:09] <uGoMobi> doesn't sound like that
[05:58:22] <_|Nix|_> No, however, it affects the shape of a bugfix.
[05:58:29] <_|Nix|_> I can file a second bug to remove that part.
[05:58:33] <uGoMobi> so it should wait until 1.5 and not land in 1.4.1
[05:58:36] <_|Nix|_> Then we can remove the modified code.
[05:58:58] <arschmitz> yea i think we probably need to wait
[05:58:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what would be the bug that you report?
[05:59:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "Remove panel's data-ajax="false" link handling"
[05:59:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's not a bug, but a TODO
[06:00:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "Panel's data-ajax="false" link handling causes behaviour inconsistent with the rest of the library"
[06:00:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does that sound more like a bug?
[06:00:42] <uGoMobi> it does
[06:00:50] <_|Nix|_> Then that's how I'll file it.
[06:01:41] <uGoMobi> but still it sounds more like an improvement than a bug
[06:02:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I guess we can mark it with the appropriate flags - like Dev tasks or feature request or something.
[06:03:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6820, this means that in response to your second comment I will say that the data-ajax="false" portion has to stay for backward compatibility and I'll link to the new bug. As to your first comment, I can switch to this._on(), but I'm not sure whether that should be part of the panel widget review, or whether I should do that as part of the bug fix.
[06:05:14] <arschmitz> it should be in the bug fix
[06:05:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll add it then.
[06:05:24] <arschmitz> your replcing the entire contents of the call anyway

[06:27:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, regarding the a:jqmData(ajax='false') handler: It also handles clicks on tab headings when the tabs are inside a panel. So, removing that click handler will make https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6693 reappear.

[07:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz _|Nix|_: Number of items in the object or array don't matter. It's line length that matters.
[07:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> A function invocation such as `doSomething({ a: b })` is fine, so is `doSomething({ a: "bunch", of: "props" })` as long as the line fits within the length limits.
[07:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> Function declarations, however, are always multiple lines, unless it's a noop.

[11:12:58] <wa5ted> anybody able to help with jquery ui sortable by column table 
[11:13:09] <wa5ted> with an unusual placeholder issue
[14:01:36] <gseguin> So I got some coverage report on coveralls.io but man it's painful to adapt our tests so they run with karma
[14:01:38] <gseguin> https://coveralls.io/files/109744710
[14:21:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Awesome! Wow!
[14:22:33] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: problem is, it's really painful to adapt the tests
[14:23:42] <gseguin> karma requires to be able to run the tests in the same iframe one after the other
[14:23:57] <gseguin> which we didn't really plan for when we wrote the tests
[14:24:24] <gseguin> right now each unit test runs in its own environment (HTML page)
[14:25:23] <gseguin> so I'm thinking karma may not be the way to go
[14:25:29] <gseguin> but using istanbul on top of our current testing framework and upload the LCOV to coveralls might work
[14:27:10] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Well, if coveralls doesn't care how we generate the coverage information, then definitely.
[14:27:23] <gseguin> nope it doesn't 
[14:27:37] <gseguin> and there is an API to upload the coverage reports
[14:27:53] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Cool, it's a lot like browserscope ...
[14:28:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... but for coverage, obviously :)
[14:28:20] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: and there is https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-coveralls
[14:28:42] <gseguin> so I should be all set once I manage to instrument the code with istanbul
[14:29:12] <_|Nix|_> Super cool!
