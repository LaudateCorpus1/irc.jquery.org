[04:53:54] <pazkooda> Hi there. Just a simple question: is JQuery datepicker localization currently broken? It doesn't work on demo page - http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#localization
[05:00:42] <scott_gonzalez> pazkooda: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/22
[05:00:47] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #22 by scottgonzalez (3mon 1w 5d 15h 1m 36s): Datepicker localization demo is broken
[05:00:51] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be fixed when 1.10.1 is released.
[05:07:08] <pazkooda> scott_gonzalez: thx
[05:46:17] <mvta> i don't understand why this code http://jsfiddle.net/FGjAJ/3/ runs in fiddle and doesn't run in local machine: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method '_change' of undefined
[05:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> mvta: Something that only fails on your local machine is certainly not something we can debug ;-)
[05:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer gnarf: We can run 16 parallel workers on BrowesrStack now. We should
[05:49:56] <mvta> yeah scott_gonzalez, you are right but maybe you could give some advice
[05:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure where we set our worker limit.
[05:50:42] <mvta> scott_gonzalez, it began to occurs when I updated libraries
[05:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> mvta: So then jsFiddle doesn't match your local code.
[05:51:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing you're using 1.10.0.
[05:51:38] <scott_gonzalez> Which means that .data( "slider" ) doesn't exist.
[05:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> Use .data( "ui-slider" )
[05:52:00] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/#removed-data-fallbacks-for-widget-names
[05:53:26] <mvta> yep!!!! thank you
[05:54:02] <mvta> ohh... I didn't read at all, sorry
[05:54:45] <mvta> it works now
[05:54:47] <scott_gonzalez> mvta: Why are you calling _change()?
[05:55:20] <scott_gonzalez> Also, a better check than if ($('#divMediaSlider').length > 0) { is if ( $('#divMediaSlider').data("slider") ) {
[05:55:21] <mvta> a need that triggers change of slider
[05:55:33] <mvta> ui-slider?
[05:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I just copy/pasted.
[05:55:45] <mvta> ;)
[05:55:47] <mvta> just kidding
[05:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> Why do you need the change event to be fired?
[05:56:05] <mvta> uhmmmmm
[05:57:06] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to figure out your use case since you're currently relying on something that is not documented and can change without warning.
[05:58:44] <mvta> sorry, one sec
[05:59:16] <mvta> well
[05:59:23] <mvta> I have a list of images
[05:59:31] <mvta> with lazyloading
[05:59:49] <mvta> and the change event
[05:59:55] <mvta> does the loading
[06:00:02] <mvta> of the visible part
[06:00:25] <mvta> *of the visible images in a div
[06:00:57] <mvta> then, the slider moves the div, the slider is working as vertical scrollbar
[06:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm with you so far. I've actually built this before.
[06:02:04] <mvta> then... do you know a better way?
[06:02:38] <mvta> and I need timeout because sometimes with IE crash...
[06:02:54] <mvta> I mean, if I tried to trigger the slidechange
[06:03:11] <mvta> just before the init code .slider({...})
[06:03:20] <mvta> it failed randomly
[06:03:49] <mvta> but, scott_gonzalez, I have a question for you
[06:04:08] <scott_gonzalez> So when do you need to trigger the fake change?
[06:04:23] <mvta> Why can't we do $('#slider').trigger('change')?
[06:04:50] <mvta> I need to trigger the change event of the slider
[06:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> mvta: I think you probably have your code backward.
[06:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> If your app logic is inside the change callback, then you're not separating your code properly.
[06:05:43] <mvta> I'm doing a refactoring in the JS of the company that I work now.... and is terrible sometimes
[06:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> Your app should have a function which loads images.
[06:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> And the slider change event should call that.
[06:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> And whenever you think you need to trigger a change event, you should call that method instead.
[06:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> As for why you can't .trigger( "change" ), there are 2 reasons.
[06:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> 1) You shouldn't be triggering a widget's event. It means you're doing something wrong.
[06:06:48] <scott_gonzalez> 2) The event is not change, it's slidechange.
[06:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> There's also #3 if your code is actually built the way that this fiddle is, which is that you're not using an event listener, you're using a callback.
[06:07:59] <mvta> ok, first of all thank you.
[06:08:05] <mvta> then
[06:08:55] <mvta> should I do $('#slider').on('slidechange',functionThatLoadImages)
[06:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, though you can still use the callback if you want.
[06:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> $( "#slider" ).slider({ change: functionThatLoadImages });
[06:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> I was just saying that even if you triggered the slidechange event, that callback wouldn't be invoked.
[06:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> But you're not doing that anyway.
[06:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> The callbacks are just sugar.
[06:11:19] <mvta> anyway, lazyloading works (in this case) with scroll of a div (a div that hasn't scrollbar) and jqueryUI Slider is working as scrollbar
[06:11:54] <mvta> I don't understand the difference between .on('slidechange') and chage:function
[06:13:00] <scott_gonzalez> .on('slidechange', fn) is an actual event listener.
[06:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> change: fn is just a callback that's handled directly by the widget.
[06:13:17] <scott_gonzalez> It's called when the widget triggers slidechange.
[06:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> But it is not bound via .on()
[06:13:35] <scott_gonzalez> It behaves as if it is an event handler though.
[06:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> It receives the event object that was used to trigger the slidechange event.
[06:14:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's purely for simplicity of implementing one-offs.
[06:14:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L478-L481
[06:18:45] <mvta> I'm trying to understand the code ;)
[06:20:06] <mvta> so, scott_gonzalez thank you a lot again
[06:20:39] <mvta> ^^ is a pleasure for me to talk with you directly 
[06:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> You're welcome.
[06:21:12] <mvta> so, scott_gonzalez, do you have some advice to refactoring a Jungle of Javascript?
[06:21:34] <mvta> (LAMP server, smarty and javascript are the last monkey in the house )
[06:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I don't think code org is a short conversation.
[06:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> And isn't appropriate for this channel.

[12:31:38] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: think we should add the code highlighting to code blocks in the pages for the new demos?
[12:32:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we are in ui-dev... but no, I don't think so
[12:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> Why would you not want code highlighting?
[12:55:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: +1 -- wp-content handles it already for you :)
[12:55:32] <gnarf> uGoMobi: toddmparker ^^
[13:49:33] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: gnarf: we do use code highlighter in the new demos for the "view source"
[13:49:53] <uGoMobi> just thought this was about a few one line code samples
[13:50:56] <uGoMobi> but turned out there are some bigger code blocks in the pages too
[18:05:32] <toddmparker> har, sorry fellas
[18:05:44] <toddmparker> irc on my phone can be…confusing
[18:45:55] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: what is the point of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.slider.js#L109-L111
[18:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> That's there because we pass array options by reference.
[18:48:09] <scott_gonzalez> And for slider we don't want to store the reference.
[18:48:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's kind of annoying that we're not consistent here.
[18:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> We decided that arrays as options are data sources and should therefore be passed by reference.
[18:49:09] <scott_gonzalez> Which makes sense for things like autocomplete.
[18:49:23] <scott_gonzalez> You can change the array and have it reflect in the suggestions on the next search.
[18:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> And if you do $( ".lots-of-elements" ).autocomplete( source: someArray )
[18:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> And then change someArray, you probably wouldn't be confused when they all change.
[18:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> The problem with slider though is that we constantly check the values of the array.
[18:51:15] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/dominicbarnes/qwybD/
[18:51:31] <scott_gonzalez> So $( ".lots-of-elements" ).slider({ values: someArray }) causes issues as shown in that fiddle.
[18:52:00] <petersendidit> yeah
[18:52:48] <petersendidit> understand now, its crazy but understand
