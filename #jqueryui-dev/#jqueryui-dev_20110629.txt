[05:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> does anyone have time to look into http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6198 ? There's a diff in the ticket
[08:55:32] <electronplusplus> Hi
[08:55:43] <electronplusplus> I'm having huge problems using Jquery UI Tabs
[08:56:15] <electronplusplus> if 2 different pages contain 2 elements with the same ID, Jquery Ui does't work
[08:56:37] <scott_gonzalez> electronplusplus: jQuery doesn't care about separate pages
[08:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> unless you're loading their contents into the same page via ajax
[08:56:53] <scott_gonzalez> in which case what you're doing is invalid
[08:57:03] <electronplusplus> invalid?
[08:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> yes, if you're loading two elements with the same id into a single page, you're creating an invalid DOM
[08:57:40] <electronplusplus> there's a quick way to fix that?
[08:57:48] <gnarf> don't use the same ID twice?
[08:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> yes, stop using the same id
[08:58:20] <electronplusplus> I know
[08:58:41] <electronplusplus> but the website is already built and it will require more extra time to change the html
[08:59:17] <scott_gonzalez> electronplusplus: this isn't a bug, there's nothing for us to do
[08:59:25] <kborchers> electronplusplus: but if your html is invalid, you should spend that time to fix it
[08:59:45] <electronplusplus> kborchers: it's invalid when using jquery UI tabs
[08:59:55] <electronplusplus> scott_gonzalez: I'm using ajax to load the pages
[09:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> it's not invalid because of tabs, it's invalid because of what you want to do
[09:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> you can probably delete the contents of your tabs every time you load a new tab
[09:00:51] <electronplusplus> how?
[09:00:51] <kborchers> it's invalid anywhere. you should never use the same id for two different elements. it should always be unique to that element. it's going to cause more headaches down the road with things other then jQuery UI's tabs
[09:00:51] <scott_gonzalez> ask for help in #jquery
[09:01:00] <gnarf> ?channels @electronplusplus
[09:01:01] <bot-t> electronplusplus, For support please go to #jquery or #jquerymobile. Development Channels: #jquery-dev - #jqueryui-dev -#jquerymobile-dev
[09:01:30] <electronplusplus> ok
[09:01:49] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ui meeting today?
[09:03:03] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez just told felix he should join the meeting
[09:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:03:18] <kborchers> cool
[09:14:56] <gnarf> http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/terraria-mac-wrapper.15236/
[09:49:44] <kborchers> gnarf: no pull yet. it's just in my fork and that fiddle since i didn't change menu at all. the code is just in the visual test itself
[09:50:54] <kborchers> that's what i was asking is if i should move those changes out of the visual test now and into menu, then issue the pull req
[09:51:18] <gnarf> is there a ticket?
[09:51:52] <kborchers> not that i know of. just been tracking stuff in the wiki.
[09:52:12] <kborchers> this is new features for menu
[09:52:19] <gnarf> oh
[09:52:20] <gnarf> sry
[09:52:22] <gnarf> i was lost
[09:52:28] <gnarf> i thought it was a pull
[09:52:52] <gnarf> someone tell bot-t to slap me
[09:52:58] <gnarf> might help with my day....
[09:53:04] <kborchers> oh, ok. nope, actually working on new stuff. :D
[09:54:38] <kborchers> gnarf: so do you know the process to move forward on that stuff or should i ask scott_gonzalez and/or jzaefferer?
[09:55:25] <gnarf> I'm not very up to speed on Menu
[09:55:38] <kborchers> ok
[09:55:57] <gnarf> I need to be soon tho
[09:55:58] <gnarf> :)
[09:56:10] <gnarf> I need some menus for my site
[09:56:21] <kborchers> i guess that's a good motivator ;)
[09:57:21] <gnarf> I wonder...
[09:57:44] <gnarf> a ui.paginator might be a work project this month
