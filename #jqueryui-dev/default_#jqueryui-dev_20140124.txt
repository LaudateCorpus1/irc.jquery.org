[02:34:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6996
[02:34:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It seems if I add overflow: hidden to the textarea, it makes the problem go away.
[02:34:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is that a reasonable thing to do, considering that we ensure that we take care of any overflow if the textarea has autogrow?
[02:35:06] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.6.x core build #532: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.6.x%20core/532/
[02:37:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just commented on my observations.
[02:38:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: We have to be careful with overflow hidden because it often cause issues on Android
[02:38:58] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[02:39:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: What exactly do you mean by "considering that we ensure that we take care of any overflow if the textarea has autogrow"?
[02:39:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What I mean is that text will never be unreachable, because we ensure that it is reachable by continuously updating the height of the textarea.
[02:39:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So adding overflow: hidden should be safe.
[02:40:03] <_|Nix|_> But, if, as you say, it causes issues on Android, then maybe a scrollbar in FF is not so bad.
[02:40:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, gotcha
[02:40:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and the scrollbar only shows up because initially we animate to the correct height.
[02:40:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If we were to jump there without animation, there would be no scrollbar,.
[02:40:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Just saying we should test on Android
[02:41:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: We had some weird issues in the past because we set overflow hidden
[02:41:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, on Android 2.3.5 the large autogrow textarea is totally useless anyway.
[02:41:41] <uGoMobi> like navbar buttons that didn't work at all because the navbar had overflow
[02:41:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No fix that I've tried can prevent it from scrolling around like crazy.
[02:41:48] <uGoMobi> overflow hidden*
[02:42:09] <_|Nix|_> Wow! That sounds bad ...
[02:42:17] <_|Nix|_> Better leave it off ...
[02:45:05] <_|Nix|_> I guess if we were to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6700#issuecomment-29895510 we could tell people to just turn off animation and there will be no scrollbar.

[02:48:45] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/066898-textarea-autogrow-save-scrollTop 1424f9ba0 15Gabriel Schulhof: Textarea: Heed linter for autogrow _updateHeight()
[02:48:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I think in this case overflow auto shouldn't cause problems on Android because there isn't any interactive element inside it
[02:49:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It would be overflow: hidden, not auto.
[02:49:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah, sorry, hidden I meant
[02:50:02] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'll add it.
[02:50:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I was about to ask if you tried overflow auto as well
[02:50:46] <uGoMobi> I know that old IE shows a scrollbar by default which you can get rid of by adding overflow auto
[02:51:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK ... I can try that.
[02:51:30] <uGoMobi> but I that's a whole different issue so I guess it won't help with this FF issue
[02:51:52] <uGoMobi> s/but I that's/but that's/
[02:53:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The site where I read that adding overflow: hidden to a textarea gets rid of the scrollbars also said that I should also, additionally add overflow-x: hidden and overflow-y: hidden because IE doesn't understand overflow: hidden. Should I add it?
[02:54:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, NM - that was for IE6 (http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/showthread.php?101187-RESOLVED-How-to-hide-a-textarea-scrollbar&p=987769#post987769)
[02:54:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, I was just checking for which version that was
[02:55:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, making sure there will never be any scrollbars is a good idea, because scrollbars can influence the height reported by the textarea, which could create a feedback with our calculation.
[02:56:18] <uGoMobi> yeah, true
[03:00:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Another benefit: In a large textarea, when it's initially resized, the resizing happens via animation.
[03:00:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, when you have a scrollbar, you see the pagesize decreasing until finally the scrollbar disappears.
[03:00:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, and when the scrollbar finally disappears, the text re-wraps.
[03:00:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, it's like twaaaaaaaaaang pop!
[03:01:35] <_|Nix|_> Without a scrollbar it should just smoothly be revealing successive lines of text until all can be seen.
[03:02:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: wasn't that resizing with animation something the users complained about?
[03:02:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They wanted the ability to turn it off.
[03:02:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[03:02:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: A workaround has been provided in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6700, IIRC.
[03:03:05] <uGoMobi> yeah, you can override the CSS
[03:03:11] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[03:03:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: all the animation stuff you just described, is that different from 1.4.0?
[03:03:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we should only fix bugs in 1.4.x, not change behaviour
[03:06:03] <_|Nix|_> I believe so. autogrow animation landed in 1.4.0.
[03:06:07] <_|Nix|_> I'm not changing behaviour.
[03:06:21] <_|Nix|_> I'm fixing bugs with the existing behaviour.
[03:07:00] <_|Nix|_> BTW: textarea.ui-input-text is overriding my overflow: hidden with overflow auto. 
[03:07:20] <_|Nix|_> It seems stronger than even textarea.ui-intput-text.ui-textinput-autogrow
[03:07:37] <_|Nix|_> I'm an idiot.
[03:07:43] <_|Nix|_> There's a typo :)
[03:07:53] <_|Nix|_> Thanks for being my rubber duck :)

[03:12:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Did you test on IE? Overflow auto was added to get rid of scrollbars on IE, so if you override it you might bring them back
[03:13:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, overflow: hidden is supposed to get rid of scrollbars no matter what - even if the content doesn't fit. I'll check it out with browserstack.
[03:13:44] <_|Nix|_> Meanwhile, http://jsbin.com/OMihUloV/3
[03:39:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: autogrow doesn't seem to work at all on IE7 ...
[03:40:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or IE8
[03:41:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we don't support IE7 anymore
[03:42:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Re: "Well, overflow: hidden is supposed to get rid of scrollbars no matter what" ... You're right. I wasn't thinking :(
[03:42:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Man ... demos.jquerymobile.com is a disaster on IE7 ...
[03:42:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ignore IE7
[03:44:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we made it C-grade because we use :after for the icons now, remember?
[03:45:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Daaah! *facepalm* ... 
[03:45:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, on IE8 autogrow doesn't work at all.
[03:45:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did it work in 1.3?
[03:46:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lemme check ...
[03:48:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nope.
[03:48:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, since it didn't work, I'm making it worse by hiding the scrollbar.
[03:49:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that will cause an accessibility issue
[03:49:23] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[03:49:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Woah, wait a sec ... now it works.
[03:49:44] <uGoMobi> lol
[03:49:54] <_|Nix|_> I may have spoken too soon ...
[03:50:10] <uGoMobi> it's autoslowgrow?
[03:50:25] <_|Nix|_> ... or I pressed a key and it auto-resized.
[03:50:50] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. It doesn't work initially, but it works afterwards.
[03:51:03] <_|Nix|_> So, maybe we need to delay the initial application of _updateHeight()
[03:51:14] <_|Nix|_> Currently we do it during pageshow, but that may be too early for IE8.
[03:51:41] <_|Nix|_> So, autogrow works, just not initially.
[03:52:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it autogrows when it gets focus?
[03:52:49] <uGoMobi> or when you actually start typing?
[03:52:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It autogrows when you type a single character.
[03:52:54] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[03:53:04] <_|Nix|_> I'll file a bug.
[03:53:16] <uGoMobi> ok
[03:55:41] <_|Nix|_> OK ... this is weird ... it doesn't work at all with master.
[03:58:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Uh-oh! We broke autogrow in 1.4.0 in IE8.
[04:00:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In 1.3.2, autogrow in IE8 did not work initially, but it does work in response to a keypress: http://jsbin.com/OMihUloV/6/ ... in 1.4.0, it no longer works at all: http://jsbin.com/OMihUloV/5/ ... in git it's also broken: http://jsbin.com/OMihUloV/1/
[04:00:20] <_|Nix|_> So, this is a regression :(

[07:50:26] <sigger> hi, i'am searching for a way to extend the jquery ui datepicker widgets HTML. I'd like to append a custom bar of buttons. I've tryed to follow the tutorial here: http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/extending-widgets/ and changed "dialog" against datepicker- with bad luck. This sure was a lazy attemp, but searching the web did not really helped me. I also looked at the "datetimepicker" extention to get an idea. But th
[07:50:59] <sigger> usecase- .. Do any one of you know a simple way to extend the datepicker?
[07:55:41] <tj_vantoll> sigger: The datepicker widget is the only widget in jQuery UI that is not built using the widget factory.
[07:55:57] <tj_vantoll> We should probably add a warning at the top of that page.
[07:56:15] <tj_vantoll> We have a rewrite of the datepicker which includes using the widget factory in progress.
[07:56:23] <tj_vantoll> Right now datepicker is painful to extend.
[07:56:29] <sigger> thank you very much for that information. Is there any clean way to append some html to the widget?
[07:56:52] <sigger> i really love jQuery-ui, you have done great work by the way 
[07:57:04] <tj_vantoll> To my knowledge there's no good way to do that.
[07:57:09] <tj_vantoll> And thanks!
[07:57:27] <sigger> you sure saved me a livetime of pain ;)
[07:58:01] <tj_vantoll> We know this is a problem, datepicker is just a whole ton of work to rewrite :)
[07:58:08] <sigger> ok great, i just started to feel too stupid. But if there is no default way, i will have to search for another way to solve this problem
[07:58:16] <sigger> i bet it is :)
[07:59:17] <sigger> i hope you don't have too much effort with. Thanks again and have a great time
[07:59:32] <tj_vantoll> np and thanks.

[09:44:51] <tj_vantoll> No worries, we can always squash that later.
[09:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yes, datepicker is the only widget that doesn't use the widget factory.
[09:49:00] <rxaviers> great ok
[09:49:10] <scott_gonzalez> It was definitely an easy mistake to make.
[09:49:20] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, how many people have looked at this and how many times?
[09:49:23] <rxaviers> I'm fixing the other comments too. Although, some requires me to rebase the branch ok
[09:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> Including myself.
[09:49:32] <scott_gonzalez> And it wasn't caught until just now.
[09:49:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, after these changes, we'll be good to merge to master, so it'll get rebased anyway.
[09:50:06] <rxaviers> good observation about the i18n/*js `$.datepicker.regional['<lang>'] = {` :)
[09:50:08] <scott_gonzalez> I think we've done enough review at this point :-)
[09:50:13] <rxaviers> ok
[09:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what made me realize the `return $.datepicker` issue :-)
[09:50:35] <rxaviers> :D
[09:50:52] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, this is one of the reasons I hate the mixture of AMD and non-AMD.
[09:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> It makes these types of mistakes REALLY easy to make.
[09:51:17] <scott_gonzalez> I've seen similar issues in various projects.
[09:51:49] <rxaviers> The issue was that initially we were not returning the widget in the AMD. So, that wasn't possible by that time.
[09:52:05] <rxaviers> But, it's totally the right thing to do now
[09:52:05] <scott_gonzalez> yeah

[09:59:56] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we need $ though.
[10:00:03] <scott_gonzalez> Just mark datepicker as the only dependency.
[10:00:33] <rxaviers> absolutely right
[10:00:58] <rxaviers> one more thing... Should I also fix some coding standard issues in this same commit? eg. datepicker.setDefaults(datepicker.regional['af']);

[10:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> No, you can just leave that.

[10:13:42] <agcolom> so the demos are kept there and are picked up and put in the place of the <!-- demos --> slot in the corresponding page?
[10:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> sort of
[10:13:55] <agcolom> which is held in https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/blob/master/page/
[10:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> The demos are copied and modified on deploy.
[10:14:55] <agcolom> interesting.... seems like a clever thing to do...
[10:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> The descriptions are removed and the script/links are reduced/replaced with CDN links.
[10:15:44] <agcolom> sounds really neat...

[10:16:20] <agcolom> I'm thinking about how to best bring the examples out of the iframes (where possible) so I was looking at what you were doing on UI... 
[10:16:38] <agcolom> (for mobile)
[10:16:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, jqueryui.com isn't a good place to look for ideas on how to work on api.*
[10:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> Since they're quite different.
[10:17:46] <agcolom> yes, I was just looking for what the various possibilities were
[10:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> To get examples out of iframes, just put them in the source.
[10:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> I thought we already went over how to do this.
[10:18:48] <agcolom> oh you mean like I did that page?
[10:18:58] <agcolom> (the tabs?)

[10:20:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what I was thinking of. I guess that produces larger output than what we're looking for though.
[10:21:03] <agcolom> yes, and I'll need to add a noop etc which we may not want to show

[11:42:08] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, tj_vantoll, I guess we're ready for the final review then
[11:44:32] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez rxaviers: *looking right now*
[11:50:10] <tj_vantoll> So we're returning $.datepicker now?
[11:50:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, $.ui.datepicker is just { version: xxx }
[11:52:07] <tj_vantoll> How do you use $.datepicker to create a new instance?
[11:52:25] <tj_vantoll> I should know the answer to this; I think I'm confusing myself.
[11:54:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: ping!

[11:54:56] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I think it's `datepicker._attachDatepicker( elem, options )`
[11:56:59] <rxaviers> should we fix this? It seems weird, isnt it?
[11:57:39] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: That doesn't look to work.
[11:58:18] <tj_vantoll> Basically I'm wondering if there's something better we could return, but datepicker is such a mess I don't think there's a better alternative.
[11:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really want to get into touching datepicker's API.
[11:58:59] <tj_vantoll> I'm wondering if $.ui.datepicker might be better to use. Even though it's useless, it's not confusing.
[11:59:36] <tj_vantoll> If we don't know what to do with $.datepicker, then no one will.
[12:00:32] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..yeah, datepicker does a bunch of one-time init :-/
[12:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> We need to return $.datepicker though, since it's needed for things like changing the "prototype", adding locales, etc.
[12:01:38] <tj_vantoll> This is such a mess.
[12:01:47] <tj_vantoll> Someone needs to rewrite this thing already…
[12:01:53] <scott_gonzalez> :-
[12:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[12:02:22] <tj_vantoll> Leave it. Land UMD.
[12:02:37] <tj_vantoll> But we need to have a note/warning in the upgrade guide specifically about datepicker.
[12:02:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/utOwEcIV/1/edit
[12:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> If the upfront init is already done, then _attachDatepicker() works.
[12:03:40] <tj_vantoll> o_O

[12:05:54] <tj_vantoll> Alright well, I don't see a better alternative here.
[12:06:00] <tj_vantoll> And that's the only thing I had.

[12:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Can you add Ref #xxx

[12:11:16] <rxaviers> ah! sure.. Let me do it in the branch and you confirm it please. It's already enough one messy commit with a TODO message on it.
[12:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:11:27] <rxaviers> ehhe
[12:11:55] <scott_gonzalez> The last commit can use Closes instead of Ref
[12:12:31] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: Also add "Fixes 9464" for the trac ticket.
[12:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, I meant use Fixes instead of Ref.
[12:13:25] <scott_gonzalez> So, the commits should have:
[12:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ref #9464
[12:13:42] <scott_gonzalez> Ref gh-1029
[12:13:56] <scott_gonzalez> And the last one should use Fixes #9464 and Closes gh-1029

[12:38:18] <benth> scott_gonzalez: ok, what is confusing?
[12:38:20] <rxaviers> Ok
[12:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> benth: Why wouldn't you want your users to know what they can do when they start dragging?
[12:39:04] <scott_gonzalez> I just don't understand why you wouldn't want the droppables to be active right away.
[12:39:12] <benth> they do know--the widget does start dragging, but i don't want it to droppable on a region until it's clear of the toolbox
[12:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> Even if not visually active.
[12:39:30] <scott_gonzalez> So how does the user know what they can do?
[12:39:53] <benth> they know because they're used to dragging widgets between regions already
[12:40:10] <benth> and they know because the toolbox area is not really that big, it's not hard to leave it
[12:40:20] <scott_gonzalez> So is there a visual change when they leave the toolbox?
[12:40:24] <benth> yes
[12:40:39] <scott_gonzalez> Why don't you just delay that visual change instead of delaying the activation?
[12:40:40] <benth> the widget starts off in a 'small' state
[12:41:05] <benth> because i have other behavior once a widget is moving inside a region

[12:41:31] <benth> there's no way to know how much to delay a visual change

[12:41:44] <benth> not move it
[12:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> How could you possibly not know?
[12:42:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's exactly the same time that you're trying to change the accept option.
[12:42:11] <benth> the visual change needs to happen after the widget is clear of the toolbox & in a region
[12:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> You know exactly when that is, otherwise this PR wouldn't help you at all.
[12:43:00] <benth> no i don't
[12:43:21] <scott_gonzalez> So how does this change possibly help you?
[12:43:32] <benth> i think we're getting our signals crossed here
[12:43:44] <benth> it helps me by getting a drag event when i want it
[12:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> Aren't you getting drag events regardless of the droppables?
[12:45:08] <benth> for the draggable, yes, so you propose I listen on that?
[12:45:14] <benth> and then...
[12:45:16] <benth> what?
[12:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> Explain what you're doing right now.
[12:45:39] <benth> I have an accept function on the regions that makes sure new widgets are clear of the toolbox area
[12:46:07] <benth> that's all
[12:46:15] <scott_gonzalez> Isn't that called once on dragstart, and that's it?
[12:46:43] <benth> I have refreshPositions on

[12:51:39] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ok... What if we had an issue + a PR number. Which one to use? Both?
[12:51:40] <uGoMobi> and there is a ticket for that
[12:51:42] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I don't remember, but personally I think it would be odd for draggable's refresh() to check droppables.
[12:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> benth: So, let's walk through how to do this without refreshPositions.
[12:52:01] <tj_vantoll> Seems like an API that should be in droppable in some fashion.
[12:52:09] <benth> scott_gonzalez: i have to a do a phone screen but i'll be back in about an hour
[12:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> On drag, use whatever check you're using in your accept callback.
[12:52:21] <benth> scott_gonzalez: but i apprecaite you going over this with me
[12:52:25] <scott_gonzalez> benth: Ok, ping me after your call.
[12:52:29] <benth> scott_gonzalez: thanks
[12:52:33] <scott_gonzalez> benth: no problem
[12:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta make sure we're covering use cases with our reduced API.
[12:53:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i need to track down cause of that
[12:53:34] <arschmitz> but as you said separate issue 
[12:54:24] <uGoMobi> right
[12:54:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I'll test some demos in that branch too
[12:55:52] <rxaviers> have a nice weekend everyone..
[12:56:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: or do the changes you made only work in this functional test?
[12:56:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the defaults in that test are the defaults in the code
[12:56:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[12:56:54] <arschmitz> so any demo will reflect
[12:57:07] <uGoMobi> the defaults seemed to work good so I'll test with that
[12:57:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i was pretty happy with them
[12:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: What's the status of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1173?
[13:01:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in Android 4.3 there is still a native browser and Chrome, right?
[13:01:34] <uGoMobi> or don't you have a 4.3 device there?
[13:02:11] <arschmitz> i dont have one
[13:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi arschmitz: Any object to quoting all url() values in CSS?
[13:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> Both Mobile and UI have a mixture of quoted and unquoted values.
[13:02:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: nope
[13:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll send a PR.
[13:02:48] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: nope
[13:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> Man, I REALLY can't type today.
[13:03:08] <scott_gonzalez> object -> objection.
[13:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> I keep typing the wrong words today :-/
[13:03:28] <uGoMobi> oh in that case... ;-)
[13:04:20] <uGoMobi> are we going for double quotes?
[13:06:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I tested the "swipe to delete list items" demo and it works nicely
[13:06:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in that demo you can scroll the list and swipe the items and I never got unwanted results
[13:07:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, double quotes.
[13:08:08] <uGoMobi> nice
[13:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> Everywhere that Mobile quotes the url() value, it's double quotes.
[13:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> There are just some values that aren't quoted.
[13:10:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and my other pr fixes the panel breaking on ios
[13:10:28] <arschmitz> well technically this does too because you wont get the unwanted close swipe when scrolling
[13:10:59] <arschmitz> ha ha iv fixed the same issue twice two different ways
[13:11:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and im submitting one now to fix all the panel issues with iframes
[13:12:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nice
[13:13:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: these three prs fix i think 10 issues lol
[13:14:15] <uGoMobi> awesome
[13:15:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think we will have a lot of fixes in 1.4.1 we have been banging them out
[13:53:56] <benth> scott_gonzalez: I'm back, you around?
[13:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> benth: yup
[13:54:29] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15scottgonzalez closed pull request #1172: Add quotes to data URI (06master...06master) 02http://git.io/nTjJxQ
[13:54:42] <scott_gonzalez> So, set the droppables to just accept the draggables from the toolbox.
[13:54:52] <benth> ok
[13:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> Then, whatever condition you're using in accept() right now, put that login into a drag callback or a drag event handler.
[13:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> And use that to trigger your visual change.
[13:55:44] <scott_gonzalez> I assume all regions are triggered at the same time?
[13:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> As soon as the item is out of the toolbox.
[13:56:21] <benth> well, it's actually a bit more complicated-- for the visual change to happen, it has to be inside a region but totally out of the toolbox
[13:56:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, ok
[13:56:40] <benth> btw, the visual change is turning the tiny widget into a full-sized widget
[13:56:48] <scott_gonzalez> Are the regions themselves the droppables or are there droppables inside the regions?
[13:56:55] <benth> before teh visual change, if you drop the widget, it reverts back to the toolbox
[13:57:11] <benth> it's the region that's droppable
[13:57:43] <scott_gonzalez> So why don't you just use the over and out callbacks?
[13:57:59] <benth> i'd get over too early
[13:58:12] <benth> basically i want custom tolerance
[13:58:32] <benth> but i did it using custom accept + a patch
[13:58:56] <benth> the toolbox can be right next to a region
[13:59:03] <benth> depending on how you have regions laid out
[13:59:14] <benth> actually, the toolbox can be over a region, even bigger problem
[13:59:19] <benth> and the regions have tolerance pointer
[13:59:56] <benth> i want tolerance pointer but with the caveat that for new widgets that they do not overlap with the toolbox
[14:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so you have all the custom logic for your tolerance written out, right?
[14:00:48] <benth> yes, but as an accept
[14:01:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, what about just implementing that as an actual custom tolerance?
[14:01:27] <benth> sure!
[14:01:28] <scott_gonzalez> By proxying $.ui.intersect().
[14:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, the API redesign makes custom tolerances much easier to implement: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/ui/jquery.ui.droppable.js#L154
[14:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> But for the current API, you should be able to just do:
[14:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> $.ui.intersect = function( original ) {
[14:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> hold on, let me gist this.
[14:03:51] <benth> yeah, that sounds totally workable
[14:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/8607674
[14:05:08] <benth> totally.
[14:05:15] <benth> i'll do that, absolutely
[14:05:20] <benth> thanks scott!
[14:05:24] <scott_gonzalez> That alone should solve everything, right?
[14:05:33] <benth> yes, i believe so
[14:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> Great. I'll leave the ticket and PR open until you get a chance to implement it and confirm.
[14:06:15] <scott_gonzalez> Just leave a comment on either once you've determined if it works for you.
[14:08:11] <benth> will do, thanks
[14:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[14:10:19] <benth> gtg again but i will update sometime today
[14:10:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
