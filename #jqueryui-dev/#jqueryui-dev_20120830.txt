[03:46:19] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: how's themeroller coming along?
[03:47:32] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, will work on it today morning, I plan to have minified generation and more server-side stuff ready. I will let you know how thing advances
[03:47:44] <rxaviers> things*
[03:47:44] <jzaefferer> cool
[03:47:46] <rxaviers> :)
[04:25:15] <kborchers> jzaefferer: oops! i'll look at it :/
[04:25:33] <jzaefferer> kborchers: when done looking, please fix ;)
[04:25:41] <kborchers> :P
[04:32:40] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I honestly can't even tell if the syntax highlighter is that good at marking things.
[04:34:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: it's not. it has styles that could make it look much better that aren't even applied. my guess is looking at the JS brush that it's just not highlighting enough things
[04:34:50] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[04:41:57] <kborchers> jzaefferer: http://stage.jqueryui.com/
[04:43:42] <jzaefferer> kborchers: nice
[04:44:01] <jzaefferer> only changed web-base-template, right?
[04:44:17] <jzaefferer> someone needs to test deploy of jqueryui.com, now that the build-download task is included
[04:44:24] <jzaefferer> it works for me, but will it work for anyone else?
[04:44:53] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, i only changed web-base-template
[04:44:58] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: at least we've got the highlighter some encapsulated now, so switching to something better, once available, is not a big deal
[04:46:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yup, hopefully we can find a good highlighter or improve the one we're using.
[04:48:57] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: let's port pygments to node!
[04:49:21] <scott_gonzalez> Just what I need, another project to work on :-P
[04:49:24] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: http://pyjs.org/ trolololo
[04:50:40] <jzaefferer> maybe not even that stupid. Convert pygments to ugly js with a cross-compiler, then write a bit of node wrapper code to put a nice API on top and wrap it as a npm module
[04:50:55] <jzaefferer> still won't support highlighting code inside script blocks though?
[04:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://pygments.org/demo/54358/
[04:57:31] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: did you ask the designers for Photoshop files for Karl?
[04:57:51] <jzaefferer> not in basecamp, as far as I can tell
[04:58:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: that demo looks good, why didn't that work for us? :/
[04:59:08] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I asked on Skype. Nate was actually on for about an hour yesterday.
[04:59:38] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I got it, if you wanted it.
[05:00:19] <jzaefferer> Nope, I don't have photoshop anyway
[05:00:57] <jzaefferer> kborchers scott_gonzalez: can one of you check the jqueryui.com deployment? local is enough, just to verify the build-download task works for you
[05:01:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'll test in a few minutes.
[05:02:37] <kborchers> jzaefferer: jqueryui.com/node_modules/download.jqueryui.com/frontend.js:10
[05:02:37] <kborchers> 		categories: release.categories(),
[05:02:37] <kborchers>                       ^
[05:02:37] <kborchers> TypeError: Cannot call method 'categories' of undefined
[05:19:53] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I just ran it after cleaning out node_modules and doing a fresh npm install and it still works fine… maybe try an `npm update`?
[05:20:05] <gnarf> jzaefferer: did stage update?
[05:20:51] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yeah, that seems to work fine now. You can even download a zip file from here: http://stage.jqueryui.com/download/
[05:20:52] <kborchers> jzaefferer: same error after npm update
[05:21:30] <jzaefferer> kborchers: can you gist `ls -al node_modules/download.jqueryui.com/` along with `npm ls`?
[05:21:37] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/2ac9f181e788f8d003b8
[05:21:43] <gnarf> jzaefferer: there was some error with npm update
[05:22:02] <jzaefferer> gnarf: oh, that stage
[05:22:22] <gnarf> jzaefferer: https://gist.github.com/8954501031f0f8b64c68
[05:22:49] <jzaefferer> gnarf: from its package.json "download.jqueryui.com": "git://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com.git"
[05:23:20] <jzaefferer> that works for download builder, with "zipstream": "git://github.com/rxaviers/node-zipstream.git"
[05:23:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hrm, it works for "npm install" but not for "npm update"
[05:23:47] <gnarf> so which of these do i do on a deploy?
[05:24:38] <jzaefferer> gnarf: usually `npm install`
[05:24:53] <gnarf> but that won't update if you change the version in package.json
[05:25:07] <gnarf> i guess i have to do both on every post receive
[05:25:08] <gnarf> lame
[05:25:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What didn't install with npm update?
[05:25:52] <gnarf> download.jqueryui.com
[05:25:57] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[05:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> Let me ping Isaac about that.
[05:26:22] <kborchers> jzaefferer: https://gist.github.com/3527506
[05:27:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/d8aa8cf8c01ef024b2f8
[05:27:33] <gnarf> yet npm install found it find
[05:27:35] <gnarf> fine
[05:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yup, I just got the same thing.
[05:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'll dig into this, it's clearly an npm bug.
[05:28:13] <jzaefferer> kborchers: there should be a "tmp" and "release" folder, created by the prepare task that build-download runs
[05:28:38] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, is the `npm update` issue something about our custom zipstream only?
[05:28:55] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I don't think so
[05:29:02] <jzaefferer> kborchers: can you provide a full stacktrace?
[05:29:03] <rxaviers> ah ok
[05:29:08] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: It's an issue with any git repo instead of a published package.
[05:29:29] <kborchers> jzaefferer: here is the output from grunt deploy https://gist.github.com/3527550
[05:29:42] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ah alright
[05:29:51] <rxaviers> thks
[05:30:44] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I guess the error handling sucks
[05:31:32] <jzaefferer> let me look up again how to properly handle spawn error results
[05:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> I just found this: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/2523
[05:33:55] <gnarf> hrm index broken? http://stage.jqueryui.com/
[05:35:05] <jzaefferer> did we ever have an index?
[05:35:14] <kborchers> not that i know of
[05:35:22] <kborchers> waiting on designers
[05:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> no index yet
[05:35:31] <jzaefferer> cool?
[05:35:32] <jzaefferer> function(error, result, stringResult) {
[05:35:32] <jzaefferer> if (error) {
[05:35:32] <jzaefferer> 	grunt.log.error( error, stringResult );
[05:35:32] <jzaefferer> 	done(false);
[05:35:32] <jzaefferer> 	return;
[05:35:33] <jzaefferer> }
[05:35:44] <kborchers> ?p @ jzaefferer
[05:35:44] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:35:46] <kborchers> :D
[05:35:49] <jzaefferer> :p
[05:37:25] <jzaefferer> kborchers: updated, can you try again? Should still fail, but provide (more) useful output
[05:38:14] <kborchers> yep, just a sec
[05:39:52] <kborchers> jzaefferer: https://gist.github.com/3527682
[05:40:27] <jzaefferer> kborchers: are you on node 0.8?
[05:40:36] <jzaefferer> looks like you aren't
[05:40:58] <kborchers> nope :/
[05:41:06] <jzaefferer> woohoo
[05:41:24] <jzaefferer> where it would be useful to specify the min node version in package.json
[05:41:38] <jzaefferer> eh
[05:41:41] <jzaefferer> download builder has
[05:41:42] <jzaefferer> "engine": {
[05:41:42] <jzaefferer> 		"node": ">=0.8.x"
[05:41:42] <jzaefferer> 	}
[05:41:43] <jzaefferer> pfft
[05:43:45] <jzaefferer> well, using their package installer is pretty easy, so give that a try and all should be good :-)
[05:44:40] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yep, building now and not instantly breaking \o/
[05:45:54] <kborchers> crap, what causes this again?
[05:45:55] <kborchers> Running "wordpress-validate" task
[05:45:55] <kborchers> >> Error: Unknown XML-RPC tag 'TITLE'
[05:48:58] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ^
[05:50:13] <jzaefferer> kborchers: try with --verbose?
[05:50:37] <jzaefferer> my guess: apache or mysql isn't running
[05:51:07] <kborchers> jzaefferer: doh
[05:51:38] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is that something grunt-wordpress could make more obvious?
[05:52:39] <kborchers> one of these days i need to actually figure out why my vhosts makes localhost break so i have to change the server when switching between work and jquery work
[05:52:48] <jzaefferer> releasing QUnit 1.10 now, unless some one has any last minute feature wishes...
[05:53:18] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I run nginx on port 80, that proxies whatever else I need
[05:53:28] <kborchers> jzaefferer: DONE WITHOUT ERRORS
[05:53:35] <kborchers> yeah, i should do that
[05:53:37] <jzaefferer> nginx "virtual hosts" are so much saner then apache config and vhosts...
[05:53:57] <jzaefferer> not sane, but saner
[05:54:52] <kborchers> cool, i'll look at that. anyway, i was able to deploy locally without errors now :)
[05:55:51] <jzaefferer> kborchers: parts of my config: https://gist.github.com/629f12a25470676879e7
[05:56:06] <jzaefferer> I also have apache vhosts :/
[05:56:24] <kborchers> thanks
[06:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I can look into that this morning. I'll turn off Apache and see what error I get, then I'll turn off MySQL and see what error I get.
[06:04:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: My apache config is actually saner than your nginx config :-P
[06:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/3528116
[06:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> All of my projects have automatic domains generated at <project>.code.dev
[06:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> Of course I still need to edit /etc/hosts to make that work :-/
[06:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: In case you haven't seen it: https://twitter.com/ryanseddon/status/241074974192959488
[06:11:52] <jzaefferer> ah, nice
[06:11:57] <jzaefferer> VirtualDocumentRoot, never seen that before
[06:12:09] <jzaefferer> I guess I just had no idea what I was doing :p
[06:15:27] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: as for the travisci thing, the link Ryan provides gets me somewhere, but doesn't show anything about modernizr
[06:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I noticed that too, stupid hashbangs
[06:16:09] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: QUnit 1.10 breaks tooltip tests, meh
[06:16:31] <jzaefferer> I guess that's one place where an extended reset is required
[06:19:00] <jzaefferer> yep
[06:24:34] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/tl77IQ
[06:24:34] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Update QUnit to 1.10.0 - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:24:34] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Restore QUnit's now dead feature of using jQuery to reset the fixture. Fixes tooltip unit tests - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:27:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: tried your vhosts config and i still get the same error i was getting before with my config. anything on localhost gets this "Domain mapping issue. You have web-base-template configured for dev.jquery.com."
[06:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: hmm...want to screenshare?
[06:28:03] <kborchers> maybe if you have time later. heading out soon to daycare drop off
[06:29:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be around all day.
[06:29:16] <kborchers> cool, thanks
[06:29:58] <jzaefferer> JBoss calls their offices "daycare"?
[06:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> How is it possible that Chrome dev has been broken for like a year and they haven't released any updates?
[06:31:24] <kborchers> jzaefferer: indeed
[06:31:48] <scott_gonzalez> Wait, what?
[06:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome is way out of date, but it thinks it's up to date.

[07:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> grunt-wordpress 1.0.3 is published with better error reporting when it can't connect.
[07:35:03] <jzaefferer> nice
[07:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to upgrade any sites you're working on.
[07:35:22] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez gnarf: is qunitjs.com supposed to still be on web-base-template legacy?
[07:35:47] <scott_gonzalez> We're ready to make the change, gnarf and I just weren't around at the same time yesterday to get that done.
[07:36:13] <jzaefferer> okay, then I won't bother cherry-picking
[07:37:06] <scott_gonzalez> nacin and I also weren't able to connect yesterday.
[07:37:10] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps timing will be better today.
[07:37:25] <jzaefferer> okay
[07:37:40] <jzaefferer> Well, code.jquery.com links to 1.10
[07:37:47] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I'm game for right now.
[07:37:52] <jzaefferer> once web-base-template is on master, the two sites will also point to the right version
[07:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Ok, let's do this.
[07:38:13] <jzaefferer> I hope kborchers can push his index page update soon for qunitjs.com
[07:38:17] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: Let's touch base at 11am, I will spend the next few minutes trying to get category/All to work here.
[07:38:24] <jzaefferer> if you get the All category done now, we can update both sites
[07:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:40:32] <kborchers> jzaefferer: hmmm, did i not push that last night?
[07:48:07] <jzaefferer> kborchers: maybe you did and it just needs to be deployed?
[07:48:23] <kborchers> jzaefferer: nope i didn't
[07:48:36] <kborchers> i just pushed plus some other quick changes and deployed to stage
[07:49:21] <kborchers> jzaefferer: web-base-template needs to update on stage and probably live too
[07:49:45] <kborchers> not sure how or if i can do that
[07:49:53] <jzaefferer> okay
[07:49:57] <jzaefferer> kborchers: needs moar padding: http://bassistance.de/i/0235dd.png
[07:50:07] <kborchers> fixed in my last commit
[07:50:13] <kborchers> added the missing line numbers
[07:50:21] <jzaefferer> ah
[07:50:22] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that looks much nicer.
[07:50:22] <jzaefferer> well
[07:50:30] <jzaefferer> it should also work without line numbers
[07:51:12] <kborchers> jzaefferer: can you add an issue for that? not sure when i'll be working again. maybe get it fixed quick tonight but don't want to forget about it
[07:51:12] <jzaefferer> once legacy is gone, I'll deploy to live
[07:51:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you mean the syntax highlight theme?
[07:51:50] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:52:01] <jzaefferer> done: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/58
[07:52:01] <kborchers> yeah, i like that better and made a couple of tweaks
[07:52:18] <kborchers> html doesn't look great though … lots of yellow :/ but not terrible
[07:52:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ^
[07:53:14] <kborchers> thanks jzaefferer
[07:53:17] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Well it's definitely an improvement.
[07:53:21] <kborchers> :)
[07:53:41] * kborchers is giving up JS and is becoming a designer :P
[07:53:56] <jzaefferer> kborchers: want to port pygments to JS? :p
[07:54:03] * kborchers hides
[07:54:39] <kborchers> it might be easier to just write a few more regexs or more specific regexs for syntaxhighlighter
[07:55:43] <jzaefferer> yeah, I guess
[07:55:54] <jzaefferer> html attributes are completely ignored right now
[07:56:13] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: add_action( 'pre_get_posts', function( $query ) { if ( $query->is_main_query() && $query->is_category( 'All' ) ) $query->set( 'category_name', '' );   });
[07:56:26] <nacin> create the 'All' category in taxonomies.json but don't assign it to anything.
[07:56:43] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, it seems like there is very basic highlighting across most languages and just needs some contribution to make it more robust
[07:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Ok, I'll test that in one minute, just writing up the weekly status update.
[07:57:19] <kborchers> there are a number of classes that aren't even used in JS that are available and could really help
[07:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Are they applied to the output just not styled or are they not being applied to the output?
[07:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Testing now.
[07:59:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not applied to output. styles are there. that's why i said just needs moar regex
[08:00:30] <kborchers> might need more styles too but there are a lot of styles that could be repurposed that aren't being touched for JS
[08:01:14] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I'm getting an empty listing.
[08:01:32] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: which site are you using? qunit?
[08:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> api.jqueryui.com
[08:02:02] <nacin> can I mess around on jq01.stage?
[08:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> $query->is_main_query() is returning false.
[08:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Yeah, you'll be working inside a repo, right?
[08:03:25] <nacin> yeah
[08:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> So you can just `git checkout .` at the end.
[08:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to play around on stage then.
[08:03:38] <nacin> cool.
[08:03:58] <nacin> hmm, the lack of an account on here is fun.
[08:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: hmm...looks like it's true for the page, but then false for the sidebar
[08:07:02] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we're not resetting the query or something?
[08:07:13] <nacin> something is going on. testing now: http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/category/All/
[08:09:16] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: it's definitely working at the query level. likely just a template thing. will have it in a second.
[08:10:49] <nacin> oh yes. query_posts()
[08:13:37] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/category/All/
[08:13:54] <nacin> I need to trigger some code that runs on all API sites. any thoughts?
[08:14:37] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe put it in mu-plugins and check against the domain?
[08:14:59] <nacin> seems sensible enough.
[08:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Before you commit, the slug will be "all" not "All"
[08:18:20] <nacin> okay.
[08:18:28] <nacin> looks nicer for sure.
[08:18:35] <scott_gonzalez> That was my fault for writing /category/All before.

[08:32:38] <doesallmagic> Scott González: Effects (Shake): Divide duration by number of animation steps. Fixed: #8531 - Shake effect: Duration is multiplied based on number of shakes.
[08:33:55] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I imagine there's no sane way to reference a github issue for a different repo in a commit?
[08:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> account/repo#number
[08:34:46] <scott_gonzalez> so jquery/api.jqueryui.com#35
[08:37:48] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: can you help me understand how to avoid fast-forward merge commits?
[08:38:13] <jzaefferer> what's wrong with fast-forward merge commits?
[08:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> git pull --rebase origin master
[08:38:30] <nacin> boom.
[08:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> merge commits are gross
[08:38:47] <nacin> ageed.
[08:38:49] <nacin> agreed*
[08:38:57] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I actually have that aliased to `git prom`
[08:39:08] <nacin> hah
[08:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> I love how prom = first letter of each word AND it's like your code and my code are dancing together :-P
[08:40:00] <nacin> either way, I'll remember it now, which is good
[08:40:34] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: did three separate commits. introduced mu-plugins/{type}-sites, where type is 'api', 'blog', etc.
[08:40:38] <nacin> fixed up query_posts() calls, which are bad.
[08:40:42] <nacin> and category/all should now work.
[08:41:20] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[08:42:23] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/category/all/
[08:43:30] <jzaefferer> nice
[08:43:32] <jzaefferer> is there an order?
[08:44:57] <nacin> orders by slug.
[08:45:19] <nacin> it ordered by title in one case and slug in the other. slug makes more sense, otherwise anything starting with . gets pushed to one end
[08:46:08] <jzaefferer> so :data() selector  and beyond isn't really inside that order
[08:47:25] <nacin> hmm, I just copied from the other template, but I don't think 'slug' actually works.
[08:47:44] <nacin> I think it'd be 'name', and even then, I don't think core supports 'name' until 3.5.
[08:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: The place where it ordered by title was probably from me trying to fix it not working with slug :-P
[08:49:14] <nacin> 'name' works
[08:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:49:41] <jzaefferer> looking good
[08:50:15] <nacin> pushed
[08:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> <b>Notice</b>:  Trying to get property of non-object in <b>/Users/scottgonzalez/Projects/wordpress-jquery-network/wp-includes/query.php</b> on line <b>3129</b><br />
[08:54:08] <nacin> this again? okay. will look.
[08:54:30] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: which page is that appearing on?
[08:54:40] <scott_gonzalez>  /category/all for me
[09:22:07] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: not actually seeing that. on master or 3.4?
[09:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: umm...let me check
[09:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, random commit.
[09:24:26] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I still get the error on master.
[09:24:27] <scott_gonzalez> <b>Notice</b>:  Trying to get property of non-object in <b>/Users/scottgonzalez/Projects/wordpress-jquery-network/wp-includes/query.php</b> on line <b>3121</b><br />
[09:42:19] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: not seeing that notice on stage or local
[09:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> Dod you have notices turned on?
[09:42:45] <nacin> :) yes
[09:43:48] <nacin> trying something else
[09:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Should I have an actual all category?
[09:47:19] <nacin> yes
[09:47:34] <scott_gonzalez> That must be the problem.
[09:47:39] <nacin> d'oh
[09:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> I had created it, but then I deleted it.
[09:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> I had it as "All"
[09:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> and when I loaded it I just got an empty listing or something.
[09:48:07] <scott_gonzalez> Let me create it again as "all"
[09:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, now it sort of works.
[09:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/2q3a2k2v2L1e
[09:50:03] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I have a fix for that locallhy
[09:50:06] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:50:07] <nacin> will commit and push
[09:50:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'll update all API repos to have the all category.
[09:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for getting this working.
[09:58:53] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: did you write jq_get_subcategories?
[09:58:59] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[09:59:17] <nacin> okay. so, it's designed to show sub-categories below the top-level categories
[09:59:23] <nacin> which I'm kind of confused about
[10:01:00] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/72ba4975ecd55ad5dcd946173b072b36b99ef586
[10:01:47] <nacin> there aren't any sub-categories on the stage site so I can't really show you
[10:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> stage.api.jquery.com should have subcategories.
[10:04:43] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: web-base-template/themes/api.jqueryui.com/index.php and web-base-template/themes/api.jquery.com/index.php look *very* different
[10:04:48] <nacin> one uses sidebar-api.php, one doesn't
[10:05:24] <nacin> locally, set the theme of api.jqueryui.com for the api.jquery.com site
[10:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> Indeed, I rewrote the index for UI.
[10:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I applied it, but I'm not seeing anything different.
[10:07:33] <nacin> try /category/ajax, perhaps, and look at the bottom of the sidebar
[10:07:40] <nacin> you should see a whole list of child categories
[10:07:47] <nacin> but in the same style as the top-level ones
[10:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, I konw what this is.
[10:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> It's going to change.
[10:08:28] <scott_gonzalez> Let me show you why this was done though.
[10:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.pixelgraphics.us/category/ajax/
[10:10:11] <scott_gonzalez> This is what we're actually going to do though: http://cl.ly/image/232k0V0y283j
[10:10:47] <nacin> makes sense. the function is out of whack then, though.
[10:11:03] <nacin> probably makes sense to remove it and re-implement when you do this
[10:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ^
[10:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I assume that's what's causing the notice and duplicated output for me.
[10:15:06] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yes
[10:15:10] <nacin> whole function should go
[10:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> ok, drop it.
[10:15:28] <nacin> then you should just use wp_list_categories() as you are already doing in sidebar-api.php, but without a set depth, then turn it into a tree.

[11:17:29] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: ha! see, if I had just taken care of that sidebar stuff last night when I said I would, we could have avoided all that ↑

[12:11:43] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/iLWBfw
[12:11:43] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Added easings page. - Scott González
[12:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Would love your feedback/updates on http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/easings/
[12:13:02] <kswedberg> sure. anything in particular?
[12:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> The content :-)
[12:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> There doesn't seem to be much to say about easings, but maybe there's something important that I didn't think of.
[12:14:17] <scott_gonzalez> The standalone jQuery Easings plugin site doesn't even explain what easings are :-P
[12:14:18] <scott_gonzalez> http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[12:15:29] <kswedberg> ok. one thing I think would be really nice is to have some kind of comparison feature for the easings. like, checkboxes or something, and then clicking one would show them both toggling
[12:16:22] <kswedberg> Maybe you could drag easings into a demo area and then press a start button or something.
[12:17:10] <kswedberg> Maybe even always have linear in there as a reference point.
[12:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> o_O kswedberg doesn't hold back
[12:19:44] <kswedberg> haha! that's pretty simple, isn't it? (he says, trying hard to sound like a client)
[12:20:22] <scott_gonzalez> That'd actually be really interesting.
[12:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> Especially if the comparison was an element moving from the left side of the screen to the right side.
[12:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> Each selection easing stacked on top of each other.
[12:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> Like a race.
[12:21:23] <kswedberg> yeah.
[12:21:26] <scott_gonzalez> By stacked on top I mean from top to bottom, each easing in its own row.
[12:21:44] <kswedberg> yeah!
[12:22:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'll file a ticket for that, I don't feel like writing the code for it right now :-P
[12:22:47] <kswedberg> ok. sounds good. :)
[12:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/42
[13:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> oh yeah! http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/10?P=docs
[13:19:07] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: trac is acting up AGAIN? :D
[13:20:48] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:20:57] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12404 feel free to comment
[13:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> "Did you loop in Jorn or Richard on your thinking about whether to remove support for $.data and event binding on plain objects?"
[13:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> Did I miss something?
[13:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> Or did he not understand your previous comments?
[13:25:30] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin
[13:25:44] <DaveMethvin> not sure
[13:25:51] <DaveMethvin> i think boris is the only person using events
[13:25:54] <DaveMethvin> data events
[13:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> It sounds like Boris thinks that we're going to stop supporting $( object )
[13:26:57] <DaveMethvin> oh well then he'd be really confused
[13:27:26] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think he uses data events.
[13:27:41] <DaveMethvin> we're planning on a long beta for 1.9, he can find out we didn't drop it when he tries the beta
[13:27:45] <DaveMethvin> :D
[13:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> I replied.
[13:31:15] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: any reason why you named the directory "page" in api.jqueryui.com instead of "pages"? It's "pages" elsewhere, which lines up better with "entries"
[13:31:45] <scott_gonzalez> I did it out of habit for copying directory names to the output.
[13:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> I can rename it.
[13:32:10] <DaveMethvin> uh oh, you set off kswedberg's OCD, now you're in trouble!
[13:32:16] <DaveMethvin> :D
[13:32:19] <kswedberg> hahahahaha
[13:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> The name grunt-wordpress cares about is "page" because that's the post type in WordPress.
[13:32:43] <scott_gonzalez> But the build-pages task will name it appropriately anyway.
[13:33:16] <kswedberg> yeah, but grunt-wordpress cares about "post" too, even though we name the directory "entries," right?
[13:34:10] <kswedberg> anyway, mind if I change it?

[17:39:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that is one beautiful looking LIVE site :)
[17:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[17:39:59] <kborchers> still needs a few things but getting close
[17:47:15] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: can you pull this over to the live site or tell me how to do it? https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/121686b2cb9a93e660f54875a9ab47cf3e3340f9
[17:48:31] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have access to the server?
[17:49:12] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: honestly, i have no idea so probably not
[17:50:11] <scott_gonzalez> heh, ok, well you can ping gnarf about that.
[17:50:18] <kborchers> ok
[17:50:19] <scott_gonzalez> In the meantime, I'll do the update.
[17:50:24] <kborchers> thanks
[17:50:40] <kborchers> gnarf: hook me up yo!
[17:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> one
[17:51:15] <kborchers> sweet
[17:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: You don't happen to have a local setup for the learn site, do you?
[17:51:37] <kborchers> nope, that's one i haven't touched
[17:52:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: is it different than the others?
[17:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> Completely different.
[17:52:37] <kborchers> that's what i thought
[17:53:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm hopeful that I can make it not at all different in one day.
[17:53:31] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd need to see what the site actually looks like first.
[17:57:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: oooooohhhhh! did you make changes to the syntax highlighter?!?
[17:57:53] <kborchers> is that what you were showing me earlier?
[17:58:31] <scott_gonzalez> I did, I don't know if that's what I was showing you :-P
[17:58:38] <scott_gonzalez> You mean when I linked to the live site?
[17:58:42] <kborchers> yeah
[17:59:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well that was part of it. But mostly that it was live and running off of master.
[17:59:30] <kborchers> ok, i got the live part but just noticed differences in the highlighting
[17:59:54] <kborchers> looks nice!
[18:01:27] <kborchers> i think all it needs is highlighting jQuery "keywords" and it would be good (like widget names, methods, etc.)
[18:03:52] <kborchers> ok can't work anymore tonight. sick baby. have a good one
[18:20:59] <Krinkle> btw, to whomever does the new  jquery site themes, the background can be a color instead of a big png
[18:21:15] <Krinkle> with alpha transparent pngs that have the highlight
[18:21:23] <Krinkle> then fill in the color with solid behind
[18:21:35] <Krinkle> might save some work / maintenace
[18:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Seems like we could just dot hat with CSS and let it fallback to a solid color.
[18:34:36] <Krinkle> oh, right. background gradient
[18:34:41] <Krinkle> even better
[18:34:57] <Krinkle> though that is still somewhat duplicative
[18:35:06] <Krinkle> you can't override/inherit half a gradient
[18:35:13] <Krinkle> unless you use two elements
[18:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> Right, but would save on page weight.
[18:35:22] <Krinkle> sure
[18:35:27] <Krinkle> surely better then now
[18:35:35] <Krinkle> now the entire image is duplicated for each theme
[18:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, can't you specify multiple backgrounds now?
[18:36:08] <Krinkle> nice thing about transparent images (e.g. where only the white hotspots are) is that one can out that in an element and fill the rest with a background color
[18:36:26] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: sure, but you can't add one later on right ?
[18:36:35] <Krinkle> e.g. one in base and in the specific theme
[18:36:44] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...probably not
[18:36:51] <Krinkle> ah, the gradient is background-image, not color
[18:36:56] <Krinkle> so the same trick as the image applies
[18:36:57] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't played with any of this new-fangled CSS :-P
[18:36:59] <Krinkle> let the gradient be transparent
[18:37:08] <Krinkle> brilliant
[18:37:19] <Krinkle> then theme fills in a background-color
[18:37:33] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to tacke that or should I file an issue?
[18:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> It would be great if we could actually have a well designed site showing how to properly use new CSS features will good fallbacks for older browsers.
[18:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> s/will/with/
[18:38:44] <Krinkle> sure, I am a designer ("officially", whatever that means) after all
[18:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> heh, really?
[18:38:57] <Krinkle> yep
[18:39:22] <scott_gonzalez> I thought you were like a sysadmin or something :-P
[18:39:39] <Krinkle> not at all, I wouldn't dare administrate servers
[18:39:56] <Krinkle> don't let me do that unless you're sure I've changed since now
[18:39:59] <Krinkle> :D
[18:40:13] <Krinkle> though I must say, working in open source does make one an expert of nearly eveyrthing
[18:40:44] <Krinkle> including community management, and maintaining servers (e.g. installing ubuntu, setting up puppet, installing packages, dependencies etc.)
[18:40:58] <Krinkle> writing documentation, tests
[18:41:11] <Krinkle> it doesn't come for free, but the ability to learn and get feedback in it is there.
[18:41:36] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/bUTaPw
[18:41:37] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Droppable: Updated docs. - Scott González
[18:41:48] <Krinkle> I've been a software develop for 3 years now though.
[18:42:51] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: so are all the themes in the same repo, or do the api.* repos extend the theme locally.
[18:42:57] <Krinkle> ah I see it now
[18:43:32] <scott_gonzalez> Most of the styles are in /themes/jquery/css/base.css
[18:43:51] <Krinkle> yeah, but I assume the overrides for specific domains aren't though they could be due to the classes on <body<
[18:43:54] <Krinkle> I'll open up an issue, if you can assign it to me (I can't do that myself afaik) I'll do it in the weekend
[18:43:55] <scott_gonzalez> But yeah, each site gets its own theme and they inherit from the jquery theme.
[18:44:31] <scott_gonzalez> Right, the sane way to do it would be to put the site-specific rules in the site-specific theme.
[18:45:29] <Krinkle> they have their own theme dirs, I suppose those are not empty?
[18:45:44] <Krinkle> hm.. almost empty
[18:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they're pretty bare because most of their styles and functionality are common.
[18:46:27] <scott_gonzalez> So styles and functionality that apply to all API sites are just in the jquery theme.
[18:46:33] <Krinkle> sure
[18:46:57] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/themes/jquery/css/base.css#L1064
[18:47:01] <Krinkle> eww I se
[18:47:05] <scott_gonzalez> There are currently styles in the jquery theme that are prefixed with site classes, but those should really move into the site-specific themes at some point.
[18:47:16] <Krinkle> yep, would also save bandwidth
[18:47:28] <scott_gonzalez> I think those were written before we had different themes.
[18:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> At least that's what I'm telling myself so I don't go into a rage-induced killing spree :-)
[18:47:51] <Krinkle> can't be that long, qunitjs is pretty fresh
[18:48:13] <Krinkle> but I guess if one is base, one tends to just follow the same pattern under the excuse of consistency :P
[18:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> The original work for web-base-template was done quite a while ago.
[18:49:02] <Krinkle> we have no build procedure for css?
[18:49:03] <scott_gonzalez> March of 2011
[18:49:11] <Krinkle> could do some minification there maybe
[18:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, right now there's no build process for web-base-template.
[18:49:53] <Krinkle> maybe also combine the base styles so there's only 2 css requests (base and local)
[18:50:03] <scott_gonzalez> At some point we'll need to start versioning, at that point we can add a build process.
[18:50:15] <Krinkle> right versioning as well
[18:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> As of now, we're just running off of master and manually updating via git pull as needed.
[18:50:53] <Krinkle> to avoid that if one person visits a jquery site, then an update happens, and then the person visits another site that there isn't an old base.css cache with a newer version local theme css
[18:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> We'll eventually get to the point where it auto-updates on semver tags, just like sites.
[18:51:09] <scott_gonzalez> right
[18:51:18] <Krinkle> that can happen now
[18:51:25] <Krinkle> wait, what do you mean by "just like sites"
[18:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> Sites will auto-deploy on semver tags.
[18:52:40] <scott_gonzalez> For example, tagging qunitjs.com at 0.0.1 would cause production to deploy.
[18:52:44] <Krinkle> it sounded like you implied "sites" (supposedly not including api sites which we talk about now) were already being auto-deployed.
[18:53:09] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, no, not yet.
[18:53:15] <Krinkle> pok
[18:53:20] <Krinkle> ok :)
[18:53:34] <scott_gonzalez> Thought gnarf will be working on that very soon now that production is using the master branch of web-base-template.
[18:54:03] <Krinkle> and protocol-relative urls? (and https?)
[18:54:08] <Krinkle> is that anywhere on the radar?
[18:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> unknown
[18:55:32] <Krinkle> http://api.qunitjs.com/web-base-template/themes/jquery/js/plugins.js looks a lot like a primitive $.Callbacks
[18:56:19] <Krinkle> I need to stop browsing now
[18:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, that reminds me that I need to delete a lot of crap from there.
[18:56:33] <Krinkle> or I'll be creating a huge todo list with more or less less important stuff
[18:56:50] <Krinkle> if we could stop time
[18:56:55] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:57:06] <Krinkle> nah, that'd be a bad thing. our bosses would stop time forever and let us work day and night
[18:58:04] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[19:08:44] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Hm.. too bad, a transparent gradient in base and a variable solid background-color for each them won't work
[19:08:53] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: although transparency works fine, css has no "blending mode"
[19:09:16] <Krinkle> the gradient looks very "wrong".
[19:09:32] <Krinkle> because the to-color (though being alpha=0) matters to how the gradient looks
[19:09:44] <Krinkle> it has to be the same as the background
[19:10:00] <Krinkle> so well have to repeat the gradient for each theme still, but that's manageable, just less ideal
[19:10:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, less ideal, but definitely a big improvement.
[19:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: BTW, I gave you access to that repo.
[19:17:24] <Krinkle> yeah, I saw that (liking Mac OS X Mnt. Lion's Notification Center a lot, emails bubble in nice - disabled GMail's html5 notifications for now)
[19:18:06] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: should I include filter: DX Gradient for old i.e. ?
[19:18:15] <Krinkle> I don't feel like doing that
[19:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> nah
[19:21:38] <Krinkle> oh nice the github auto-refresh thing even auto-updated the "issue creation" form while I was busy
[19:21:45] <Krinkle> (it enabled the "comment & close" button)
[19:21:58] <Krinkle> issue reply form*
[19:23:12] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: any feedback on https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/60 ? If not I'll go ahead and commit it for qunitjs
[19:23:27] <Krinkle> rest can follow later if we like it
[19:24:46] <Krinkle> hm.. interesting, when I try to copy'n'paste that into the css editor (not in the elements tab but in the resources tab, the raw stylesheet editor ) it crashes ("Oh, Snap")
[19:24:49] <Krinkle> consistently
[19:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> Is the ms- prefix necessary?
[19:25:18] <Krinkle> IE10 ?
[19:25:24] <Krinkle> let me check caniuse
[19:25:30] <scott_gonzalez> caniuse says it's not prefixed.
[19:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> http://caniuse.com/#search=radial
[19:25:47] <Krinkle> indeed
[19:26:19] <Krinkle> but does it support the newer syntax as well? since it changed
[19:26:19] <scott_gonzalez> That's my only feedback, I'd say go ahead with it :-)
[19:26:26] <Krinkle> ah "IE10 also supporters the to syntax"
[19:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> I commented on the ticket just for posterity.
[19:30:25] <Krinkle> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=145897 can you star it as well ?
[19:30:57] <Krinkle> (while at it, can you try to reproduce it)
[19:31:32] <Krinkle> Wow the default text area is huge now on github
[19:31:39] <Krinkle> a bit too big if you ask me
[19:31:58] <Krinkle> hm.. never mind, it remembered my manual resize
[19:32:09] <Krinkle> (the dragger thing), maybe that's cool that it remembers that
[19:33:24] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: bug doesn't exist in Canary
[19:33:48] <scott_gonzalez> Confirmed in stable though.
[19:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> It looks good :-)
[19:34:37] <Krinkle> I know how it looks even though I can't paste it all. I took the values out of the inspector (made them live)
[19:34:46] <Krinkle> Thanks
[19:35:07] <Krinkle> interesting, It seems the alpha png trick I suggested is used just not for the html
[19:35:10] <Krinkle> http://api.qunitjs.com/asyncTest/
[19:35:16] <Krinkle> the green "asyncTest( name, expected, test )" heading
[19:42:12] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: can you check wordpress settings what the permalink structure is for qunitjs.com?
[19:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> It should be the same for all sites, I think.
[19:42:46] <Krinkle> I see that all links are /pagename but it 301 redirects on every link to /pagename/ (trailing slash)
[19:42:47] <Krinkle> kinda bogus if every link is a redirect
[19:42:52] <Krinkle> It may be affecting all sites
[19:43:03] <Krinkle> in that case we need to decide which to use (to trail or not to trail)
[19:43:10] <scott_gonzalez>  /%postname%/
[19:43:13] <Krinkle> I like them without trailing slash
[19:43:18] <Krinkle> That's what I thought
[19:43:23] <Krinkle> should be without /
[19:43:33] <scott_gonzalez> No, all of our links are supposed to be with.
[19:43:35] <Krinkle> not sure how it goes with compatibility though
[19:43:40] <Krinkle> ok
[19:43:43] <Krinkle> then we need to fix the output
[19:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, there are probably lots of links without them. We need to fix them all.
[19:44:21] <Krinkle> btw, I haven't bee digging into wordpress for a few months
[19:44:26] <Krinkle> isn;t there a function to generate a link ?
[19:44:29] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/121686b2cb9a93e660f54875a9ab47cf3e3340f9/themes/qunitjs.com/menu-header.php
[19:44:44] <Krinkle> no hardcoding of domains (also makes it easier to test on stage)
[19:44:51] <Krinkle> and thus permalink structure
[19:46:37] <scott_gonzalez> URLs are auto-adjusted on stage and dev.
[19:47:05] <Krinkle> yeah, wordpress always does that
[19:47:14] <Krinkle> oh, you mean cross-domain ?
[19:47:19] <scott_gonzalez> No, I meant to dev. and stage.
[19:47:41] <Krinkle> how does that work
[19:48:07] <scott_gonzalez> We put all of the output into a buffer and then replace known domains :-)
[19:48:52] <Krinkle> there is no need to hardcode domains, we'd save output by using href=/ etc. (relative paths), that still harcodes the location of wordpress , but better than hardcoding both I'd ssay
[19:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I don't include the domain when linking within a site.
[19:49:51] <scott_gonzalez> For example: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries/accordion.xml#L35
[19:50:06] <Krinkle> this is part to blame to wordpress which always goes absolute urls.
[19:50:11] <Krinkle> but that's configurable afaik
[19:50:16] <Krinkle> at least anything we produce can be made relative
[19:50:19] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/themes/qunitjs.com/menu-header.php
[20:11:32] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: still around?
