[06:32:39] <nutzz> Hi I have a jquery ui accordion. Thea header is made of a div which contains a h3 element and a button. I want that when I press the button the accordion don't collapse. I ahve tried to use the header attribute like this => header: "div > h3", but it breaks my layout?

[08:50:32] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Could you please have a look at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/396?
[08:50:41] <arschmitz> yup
[08:50:44] <gabrielschulhof> Thanks!
[08:51:27] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: That's just removing whole files (and references to them, in the case of the initSelector include).
[08:51:43] <gabrielschulhof> There's plenty more deprecated stuff to remove.
[08:52:14] <arschmitz> some of that should be deprecated not removed
[08:52:18] <arschmitz> like initselector
[09:02:20] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, OK. So, like, even though it was deprecated in 1.4?
[09:02:31] <gabrielschulhof> It remains deprecated in 1.5?
[09:05:06] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Then there's the whole issue of page events. We documented that they will be removed in 1.5, all except pagebeforechange, which will stick around until 1.6.
[09:05:13] <gabrielschulhof> Despite this, we still trigger them.
[09:05:45] <gabrielschulhof> I mean, I remember that we still need them because we deprecated them late, but is that the case for all page events or just pagebeforechange?
[09:22:46] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: we decided all page events were staying until 1.6
[09:23:12] <arschmitz> because they were all messed up and some not officially deprecated until 1.4
[09:23:47] <arschmitz> initSelector was not deprecated in 1.4 as far as i know?
[09:25:44] <arschmitz> collapsible-set was deprecated in favor of collapsibleset?
[09:45:13] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: OK. âœ“ on page events.
[09:45:30] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: initSelector was deprecated, according to our API docs.
[09:46:15] <arschmitz> oh right the option
[09:46:22] <arschmitz> its on prototype now
[09:46:34] <arschmitz> and being on prototype is deprecated in 1.5
[09:46:39] <gabrielschulhof> Right.
[09:47:05] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so removing option initSelector is the right way to go.
[09:47:54] <gabrielschulhof> I guess the enhancer documentation will take care of mentioning the complete deprecation of initSelector, right?
[09:48:12] <gabrielschulhof> ... because the enhancer backcompat will be gone in 1.6.
[09:54:02] <arschmitz> yes
[09:54:22] <gabrielschulhof> Excellent!
