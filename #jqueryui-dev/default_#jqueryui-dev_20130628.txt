[05:05:19] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, hi! all `dist/wordpress/posts/*/*.html` files have a script tag with a JSON data. Who uses (what services use) that data? I'm wondering how likely it is to change over time?
[05:05:40] <rxaviers> s/?$/./
[05:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> It'll never change.
[05:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> It's used by node-wordpress.
[05:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> My brain is not working right now.
[05:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> I just ran `git pull upstream origin`
[05:25:45] <kborchers> lol
[06:36:51] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper, which part of the meeting notes do you want me to put on the meetings site? (I can do that this evening)
[06:37:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Hi Anne
[06:37:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the whole doc
[06:37:56] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks!
[06:37:58] <agcolom> perfect. I'll do that this evening
[06:38:23] <uGoMobi> great :)
[06:38:39] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez thks
[06:44:08] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5884763
[06:44:37] <rxaviers> are you ok with me adding a `manifest` task on api.jqueryui.com, so DB can get that JSON?
[06:52:27] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Sure.
[06:52:34] <rxaviers> ;)
[06:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> There are existing methods to walk the directory and parse the data.
[06:53:23] <scott_gonzalez> Look in tasks/posts.js in grunt-wordpress.
[06:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> The wordpress-walk-posts helper
[06:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> Which uses some lower level helpers to do the walking and parsing.
[06:54:27] <scott_gonzalez> If you just use the wordpress-walk-posts helper, it should make your code pretty small.
[06:57:39] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, hm.. I should have asked you before, it seems I didnt need to make this https://github.com/rxaviers/api.jqueryui.com/blob/categories/lib/category.js
[06:57:39] <rxaviers> :(
[06:58:00] <rxaviers> will check your methods...
[07:49:55] <jquicommit> [13download.jqueryui.com] 15jsnively opened issue #152: ui_icons png files from jQ-UI 1.9.2 do not render correctly in IE 6  02http://git.io/jNtI9A
[07:58:41] <frequent> arschmitz: ping
[08:01:49] <arschmitz> frequent: hi
[08:08:08] <arschmitz> frequent: when ever you have some time i have looked at your widget and have some feedback
[08:11:05] <frequent> arschmitz: back
[08:11:27] <arschmitz> frequent: cool
[08:11:35] <frequent> go ahead
[08:11:58] <arschmitz> the _onKeyUp method is HUGE
[08:12:11] <arschmitz> you should try and break that down into small discreet methods
[08:12:22] <frequent> ok
[08:12:53] <arschmitz> never use .jqmData()
[08:13:02] <arschmitz> perfromance is really bad
[08:13:26] <frequent> mh. must be leftover from previous version. ok
[08:13:44] <arschmitz> i believe we have removed everywhere in the actual library and just provide it as a connivence method for people 
[08:14:02] <frequent> ok
[08:14:17] <arschmitz> you dont need to read in data attribute options on create
[08:14:25] <arschmitz> thats done automaticly by the mobile base widget
[08:14:53] <frequent> ah. cool. Did not know.
[08:15:17] <arschmitz> dont worry about options in refresh
[08:15:25] <arschmitz> add the _setOptions method
[08:15:30] <arschmitz> and handle all option setting in there
[08:16:07] <frequent> ok
[08:17:55] <arschmitz> it also looks like your adding divs and doing a bunch of dom manip on refresh that unless im missing something should probably be done only once on _create
[08:19:13] <frequent> hm. I have to check. I switched from using a <form> as wrapper to a <div> because the form never gets submitted anyway and is a blocker when using a filter inside a real form. Will switch to doing things on _create tough
[08:20:35] <arschmitz> frequent: also you should add a classes and id options
[08:20:41] <arschmitz> and apply these to the wrapper
[08:21:05] <arschmitz> and have a way to skip enhancement with an enhanced option that assumes the elements are already there
[08:21:20] <arschmitz> with proper classes
[08:21:47] <frequent> ok
[08:22:05] <arschmitz> frequent: so really your enhancment should be in something like _enhancment and call that from _create as long as the enahnced option has not been set
[08:22:28] <arschmitz> frequent: also in general you should be binding your events at create not refresh
[08:22:56] <arschmitz> frequent: your also missing a few required things
[08:23:02] <arschmitz> you need to handle disable and enhable
[08:23:06] <arschmitz> and destroy
[08:23:08] <frequent> :-(
[08:23:20] <arschmitz> frequent: sorry i know its a lot
[08:23:25] <frequent> np
[08:23:37] <arschmitz> and one last thing
[08:23:42] <frequent> thanks for taking the time and having a look
[08:23:52] <arschmitz> you should considder using a timeout buffer on keyup
[08:24:12] <arschmitz> so if someone is typing it does not try and filter on every keystroke
[08:24:13] <frequent> ok. I'm doing this in my own app, too. np.
[08:24:37] <arschmitz> cool we really appreciate the work
[08:24:42] <frequent> np
[08:24:48] <frequent> question:
[08:24:51] <arschmitz> and its looking good just needs some clean up
[08:24:56] <frequent> cool
[08:25:01] <arschmitz> sure go ahead
[08:25:37] <frequent> Have you considered moving the search-icon in the search input to the right?
[08:25:43] <frequent> next to the clear icon
[08:25:52] <arschmitz> i dont believe we have
[08:26:01] <arschmitz> iv never heard anyone suggest it before
[08:26:04] <frequent> I'm often adding a button just so that user has something to click, because ...
[08:26:14] <frequent> it does not seem obvious to some that return = submit
[08:26:28] <frequent> youtube web app is doing it like this now 
[08:26:35] <frequent> and I like it a lot.
[08:26:49] <frequent> 1sec (looking for a link...)
[08:26:50] <uGoMobi> frequent: I agree with you
[08:27:24] <uGoMobi> frequent: the icon that we add can be a bit confusing on desktop
[08:27:32] <frequent> arschmitz: uGoMobi: http://bit.ly/14CgGy8
[08:27:44] <frequent> check the search input in the panel
[08:28:14] <frequent> focus shows search-button (old icon). entry shows clear button as well.
[08:28:49] <arschmitz> frequent: cool i have no issue either way uGoMobi the theme guy :) 
[08:29:13] <arschmitz> frequent: just fyi for me your count boubles are on top of the text in header 
[08:29:22] <uGoMobi> I am not in favor of having a clear and submit button next to eachother
[08:29:22] <arschmitz> bubbles
[08:29:31] <frequent> yeah. just my 1.3 playground
[08:29:45] <arschmitz> frequent: cool
[08:30:06] <frequent> thx
[08:30:20] <uGoMobi> I prefer a search submit button outside the input field
[08:30:31] <uGoMobi> and hide it on mobile
[08:30:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats what iv always done
[08:31:02] <frequent> 1sec
[08:31:06] <uGoMobi> but this is not something we can do in the framework
[08:31:08] <arschmitz> i do it just to the right of input
[08:31:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, same for me
[08:31:55] <arschmitz> i think thats my personal preference 
[08:32:08] <arschmitz> but yeah not something thats really part of framework
[08:32:31] <uGoMobi> yup, submit buttons is something that people should add themselves
[08:33:15] <uGoMobi> but I think the icon that we add can be a bit confusing, it might look like a button
[08:33:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah its a hard one
[08:34:06] <arschmitz> because you could also say that its kinda a universal symbol for search too
[08:34:45] <uGoMobi> it is, but often it is used as icon in the submit button
[08:35:06] <uGoMobi> and "search..." as placeholder text
[08:35:10] <arschmitz> frequent: back to your widget for just one sec if you have not already looked http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/ you should just basic style guide for all jQuery stuff
[08:35:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah not sure there is any real standard on that
[08:35:43] <arschmitz> that different places use
[08:36:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its exactly the same as ios search input right now
[08:36:24] <frequent> uGoMobi: arschmitz: on the phone, will read up
[08:36:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, but with background disc
[08:37:00] <arschmitz> yup
[08:37:02] <uGoMobi> that is what I find confusing
[08:37:13] <arschmitz> yeah i agree on that one i should not have the disc
[08:37:15] <uGoMobi> maybe we should remove that
[08:37:33] <arschmitz> the disc?
[08:37:35] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:37:52] <arschmitz> go for it
[08:37:57] <arschmitz> nows a good time with a new theme
[08:38:09] <uGoMobi> yes, going to give that a look
[08:38:18] <uGoMobi> working on icons at the moment anyway
[08:38:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool perfect timing
[08:38:41] <arschmitz> and you were going to make change to search anyway for clear :)
[08:38:55] <uGoMobi> right
[08:39:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh just so you know i think i got the note 2
[08:39:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh great
[08:40:21] <arschmitz> just need to see when i can catch up with them they are a long ways away but is willing to drive to me when they have time
[08:40:47] <uGoMobi> oh that's nice
[08:57:35] <frequent> arschmitz: uGoMobi: ok. sounds good to me too (removing the disc). And... although it breaks most of my things, nice job on 1.4 so far. Even my old Android feels a little bit snappy now... :-)
[08:58:11] <arschmitz> frequent: yeah its pretty breaking when it comes to custom css
[08:58:37] <arschmitz> but preliminary tests already show ~50% reduction in dom manip 
[08:58:58] <frequent> feels like this, too
[09:01:02] <arschmitz> frequent: and with options to eliminate all dom manip and just bind events it will be super fast :)
[09:06:55] <frequent> arschmitz: that would be nice :-)
[09:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: regarding implicit form labels, this is apparently not an issue anymore.
[09:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H44.html
[09:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> Note the verions that were being tested.
[09:25:36] <scott_gonzalez> John Foliot says these bugs have been fixed for a long time.
[09:43:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: according to this article, WindowsEyes is the only one to fail to read the labels, but only in browse mode: http://usability.com.au/2013/04/accessible-forms-1-labels-and-identification/
[09:43:40] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I think that's good enough for our purposes
[09:44:16] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: when did we discuss this? Does it affect any existing code?
[09:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> We chose not to support implicit labels in the button widget because of this.
[09:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> And we documented it.
[09:44:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jqueryui.com/button/
[09:45:42] <jzaefferer> ah, right
[09:48:53] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..WindowEyes is still pretty popular
[09:48:54] <scott_gonzalez> http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey/
[09:53:34] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: that's the first survey they did, the newest one has different numbers, and has separate stats for "used" and "primarily used": http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey4/#primary
[09:53:57] <jzaefferer> doesn't invalidate WindowsEyes, but it certainly lost ground
[09:54:41] <jzaefferer> not even that big a difference, considering there's 4 years inbetween
[09:56:12] <scott_gonzalez> Still #2
[09:56:59] <scott_gonzalez> And it actually says "Window-Eyes and ZoomText saw small increases in primary screen reader usage"
[10:52:10] <gseguin> anybody can help with a git effing crlf issue?

[11:44:56] <uGoMobi> pfff
[11:45:37] <arschmitz> i dont even know what the problem is but the way its written is hilarious
[11:46:20] <uGoMobi> into iframe and out ??
[11:46:30] <arschmitz> yeah i have no idea what hes talking about
[11:46:32] <uGoMobi> :/
[11:48:56] <arschmitz> oh i bet i know the problem
[11:49:03] <arschmitz> i bet its the same one we have in the docs
[11:49:47] <uGoMobi> access denied
[11:49:49] <arschmitz> yup has nothing to do with mobile its that he has an inline script on the i frame
[11:50:25] <arschmitz> so the inline script runs before the remote ones and $ and jquery are not defined
[11:50:35] <agcolom_> does anyone need a dropbox referral? (I've run out of space :-( )
[11:50:59] <arschmitz> agcolom_: sure
[11:51:20] <agcolom_> oh, great, thanks!
[11:52:34] <uGoMobi> dropbox gives extra space for a lot of things, right?
[11:52:39] <agcolom_> yes
[11:53:01] <uGoMobi> I got extra space when I turned on auto upload pics from phone
[11:53:12] <uGoMobi> they didn't take it back when I turned it off again
[11:53:16] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:53:24] <agcolom_> oh, I need to check that...
[11:53:51] <agcolom_> I got my kids on it, but iPad connection doesn't seem to be acceptable... has to be desktop/laptop it seems...
[11:54:13] <uGoMobi> ohw :(
[11:55:46] <uGoMobi> I now see I got one Gb extra space for that
[12:04:56] <agcolom_> oh 1Gb! I shall investigate!
[12:08:47] <uGoMobi> agcolom_: just have to install the dropbox app on a device with camera and turn on auto upload
[12:09:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i have that
