[07:41:24] <WRidder> hi folks. Was wondering why only 1.10.4 and 1.10.5 are published to the NPM registry. Would it be possible to publish the newer versions as well?
[07:43:39] <scott_gonzalez> WRidder: We don't publish to npm. That's some random person.
[07:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/devongovett/jqueryui-npm
[07:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> They don't have issues turned on, so you can't even bug them about it.
[07:44:35] <scott_gonzalez> We've reached out before, without luck.
[07:45:01] <WRidder> hm... that's annoying
[07:45:09] <WRidder> basically he/she shut you out, am I correct?
[07:45:24] <WRidder> if no new versoins are published
[07:45:58] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose. I'll defer to jzaefferer since he's the one that reached out before.
[07:46:30] <WRidder> it's still possible to install with NPM using the repo link; but still, people may get confused
[07:46:52] <WRidder> but thanks for the quick response!
[07:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> Note that the published module is also shimmed for browserify.
[07:47:36] <scott_gonzalez> So it's not even the same as installing from the real repo.
[07:52:20] <scott_gonzalez> Also interestingly `npm install jquery-ui` doesn't seem to install the 1.10.5.
[08:00:07] <jzaefferer> I've contacted the author, they offered to hand over the npm name, but that was it
[08:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, so we should get him to add you as an owner.
[08:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can remove him and add the rest of the appropriate owners.
[08:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> Can start publishing with 1.12.
[09:51:35] <se00_> hey everybody
[09:51:45] <se00_> didn't you guys see my messages this morning?
[09:51:58] <se00_> something is wrong with bugs.jqueryui.com
[09:52:02] <se00_> check logs
[09:53:09] <arthurvr> se00_: I actually did see those, but you already left ;) Sorry to hear youâ€™re having troubles. We had some problems lately but I think everything works fine atm. Everything was fixed right scott_gonzalez?
[09:53:35] <se00_> okay I will retry (fifth time)
[09:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, should be working now.
[09:55:03] <se00_> It does seem to work now, but terribly slow actually thank you arthurvr and scott_gonzalez
[09:55:28] <se00_> anyone of you interested in answering my real question? What's wrong with github issues?
[09:55:40] <scott_gonzalez> Lots :-)
[09:55:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's not nearly as useful as Trac.
[09:55:52] <scott_gonzalez> And porting the data would suck.
[09:56:02] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub Issues are very basic.
[09:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> For example, there's not even a resolution.
[09:56:12] <scott_gonzalez> It's either open or closed.
[09:56:25] <scott_gonzalez> There's no such thing as fixed, won't fix, can't fix, et.c
[09:56:33] <scott_gonzalez> Anything you want to do has to be done through labels.
[09:56:43] <se00_> okay understandable - thanks for the answer!
[09:57:35] <se00_> you do consider that it keeps away contributions? I know it has it's valuable things but I mean... the whole community lives on github, not there.
[09:58:04] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have proof of that?
[09:58:21] <se00_> and reporting a nasty bug took me ~4 days and disturbing you on irc, scott_gonzalez arthurvr
[09:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> That's not because we use Trac, that's because we're having issues.
[09:58:56] <se00_> I don't you what you would consider a good "proof" for that? numbers from other projects I guess?
[09:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> Umm...what numbers?
[09:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> What exactly would you be looking at to show that we're losing contributors?
[10:00:05] <se00_> scott_gonzalez:if I do remember right there were also troubles with your trac setup a year ago yet
[10:00:10] <se00_> which is sad
[10:00:52] <se00_> scott_gonzalez: just asking what you want to 'proof this'? I guess you was asking if there were any analytics proof coming from other projects?
[10:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> You asked if we considered that it keeps away contributions.
[10:01:25] <scott_gonzalez> Implying that we're actually losing out on contributions.
[10:01:33] <scott_gonzalez> I want to know why you think that's happening.
[10:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> And what proof you have.
[10:03:01] <se00_> everybody has an account on github so a bug report would take them a minute or five. Right now it takes them the time to create and account, mess with stuff because the setup is broken, report the bug in an interface they're unfamiliar with, ...
[10:04:00] <scott_gonzalez> And you think people are bailing at the creating an account step?
[10:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> Do you honestly thin anyone is confused when they see the new ticket page?
[10:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> s/thin/think/
[10:05:19] <se00_> I don't, but I do believe many simple frontend just don't want to deal with that all
[10:05:32] <se00_> and yes, trac is that ugly (sorry!) and has a bad UX for newcomers
[10:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> Trac has bad UX or our messed up install right now is annoying?
[10:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> Don't conflate those.
[10:06:02] <se00_> both actually
[10:06:11] <se00_> IMHO
[10:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> What's bad about the UX?
[10:09:15] <se00_> people that just worked with simple interfaces (like github issues, but that's just an example) are confused by terms as "owners", "blocking" and just the unsexy visual design at all
[10:09:34] <se00_> also I remember you guys were working on fixing it and I only saw it becoming worse
[10:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> Can you take a screenshot of the page you see when you're creating a new ticket?
[10:09:59] <scott_gonzalez> None of that should be there.
[10:10:43] <se00_> (and I wasn't involved in many tickets, but some. Total newcomers will just have the same or even a worse feeling.)
[10:12:19] <se00_> scott_gonzalez: nobody says newcomers only enter the "new ticket" page ;)
[10:12:27] <arschmitz> se00_: I would just like to say i personally do think there is some truth in what your saying
[10:13:17] <arthurvr> Me too
[10:14:09] <arschmitz> se00_: this is something that has been discussed in meetings with the team as recently as a few weeks ago
[10:14:17] <se00_> they actually followup on other ticket afterwards (hopefully are involved in the ticket), check other tickets (search if there are no duplicates)
[10:15:06] <se00_> Guys, really, I understand the fact you need trac. Just saying there are many disadvantages for people totally not involved in oss before.
[10:15:18] <se00_> and pushing you to fix the setup :D
[10:15:26] <se00_> scott_gonzalez:^
[10:15:33] <arschmitz> se00_: yes but much of this could be fixed if we could get our actual trac install fixed
[10:15:45] <arschmitz> se00_: the real problem is the actual install is very broken right now
[10:16:03] <arschmitz> preventing us from fixing the issues and adding things like the ability to add logging in with your github id
[10:16:31] <arschmitz> se00_: We do have members of the actual core trac team helping us and working on this right now though
[10:17:15] <arschmitz> se00_: so before we make the jump and abandon ship we want to give them a chance to get this fixed for us so we can keep all the benefits that trac offers over github issues
[10:17:46] <se00_> I know but it, for me, looks like you guys are telling this for years. I remember right @jquery was tweeting for help on the setup years ago am I?
[10:18:16] <arschmitz> se00_: yes last year and we had people start to help and they never panned out though
[10:18:29] <se00_> arschmitz: glad to see you guys think about it, though.
[10:18:30] <arschmitz> now just starting like 3 weeks ago the actual trac team offered to help
[10:19:44] <se00_> sounds awesome (still it has a higher barrier to entry, but it would be a huge step forward)
[10:19:49] <arschmitz> se00_: the actual resolution when we talked about this was that this was our "last chance" to get it fixed since if they cant do it no one can 
[10:20:01] <arschmitz> se00_: they offer github login
[10:20:07] <arschmitz> so thats not actually true
[10:20:43] <se00_> nah, I knew that, I just think it's still a __little__ more of a barrier
[10:21:23] <se00_> but hey guys, this discussion is useless all four of us, just I'm glad to see you're all aware of it and are thinking about it well
[10:21:32] <se00_> bye everybody
[10:22:18] <se00_> one last thing, the core development team switched?
[10:22:25] <arschmitz> se00_: thanks and yes we absolutely think about it and discuss it pretty regularly 
[10:22:40] <arschmitz> core development team switched? what do you mean?
[10:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, they switched to GitHub Issues.
[10:23:01] <arschmitz> oh yeah core switched to github
[10:23:03] <se00_> weren't they using trac back a few months ago
[10:23:07] <se00_> yeah what I meant
[10:23:07] <arschmitz> se00_: yes
[10:23:27] <arschmitz> they did indeed
[10:23:46] <arschmitz> they install was more broken then ours from what i gather and they decided to just switch
[10:23:52] <se00_> teams opinion or just because their setup was broken as well?
[10:23:58] <se00_> and hey you answered already
[10:24:01] <se00_> thanks
[10:24:10] <arschmitz> its up to each team what they use
[10:25:28] <se00_> okay okay
[10:25:29] <se00_> bye
[10:26:40] <se00_> y'all are doing awesome work on the UI team, arschmitz scott_gonzalez arthurvr. Keep it up and thanks for saving me hours (actually years perhaps)
[10:26:52] <arthurvr> Iâ€™m not on the UI team lol
[10:26:59] <arschmitz> se00_: thank you!
[10:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks se00_. Hopefully Trac will be fixed in the next few weeks.
[10:27:55] <se00_> arthurvr: sorry haha
[10:27:58] <se00_> and bye guys

[11:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I've got a slightly different approach for the form reset. I'll ping you when I'm done with it.
[11:44:26] <scott_gonzalez> (working on selectmenu)
[11:44:46] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats not my original approach jzaefferer got me to change that so im curious how your doing it
[11:45:34] <scott_gonzalez> Storing an array of instances.
[11:46:09] <arschmitz> and then just doing inArray?
[11:46:26] <arschmitz> thats what i was more or less trying to do but i did it bad which is why jzaefferer got me to change
[11:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> inArray for what?
[11:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> For splicing on destroy?
[11:47:04] <arschmitz> wait maybe im not following what your doing exactly
[11:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> Let me finish, then I'll show you.
[11:47:30] <arschmitz> sure
[12:25:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Ping!
[12:36:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What's up?
[12:57:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hey so your getting your wish
[12:58:11] <arschmitz> we are adding an extension for form rest
[12:58:17] <arschmitz> reset to ui 
[13:01:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Yaaaay!
[13:01:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Is there some code for me to look at? Just curious ...
[13:02:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: scott is working on a PR
[13:02:09] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[13:02:14] <arschmitz> but it depends on my pr im doing for forPArent
[13:02:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Of course :)
[13:06:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: A while back we had a discussion about inset. Do you remember how we decided to make it fit with the classes option? IIRC we decided to keep the option because it toggles a class key (ui-listview-inset), and if both ui-corner-all and ui-listview-inset are present, then, oh well, it's the developer's responsibility to at the same time remove ui-corner-all from the ui-listview key. Do I remember our decision correctly?
[13:07:20] <gabriel_schulhof> *sigh* ... it would help if IRC logs were searchable - at least by us.
[13:08:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: just a sec let me think through that
[13:09:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that *sounds* right
[13:12:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, well the code's gonna do all the talking anyway, so you'll get to see it in the PR :) ... but that's how I'll write it.
[13:12:21] <arschmitz> ok
