[06:31:43] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Upgrade jQuery to 1.8.0. - Scott González
[08:20:58] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Let me know when you've got a few minutes to look at something.
[08:21:08] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I'm around, shoot.
[08:21:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'm having trouble getting pages to show up, but posts are working just fine.
[08:21:47] <scott_gonzalez> Let me switch back to using pages and get the error for you.
[08:24:43] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to get property of non-object in <b>/Users/scottgonzalez/Projects/wordpress-jquery-network/wp-includes/query.php</b> on line <b>2679
[08:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'm on 3.4.1, but I get the same error on master.
[08:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, I did get the same error on master before, but now master is doing the wrong site thing that Richard created an issue for.
[08:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Do you want to screenshare or do you know what might be going on?
[08:31:00] <nacin> one second, looking.
[08:31:08] <nacin> got distracted by other IRC channels.
[08:57:43] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: are you around?
[08:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: yup
[08:59:44] <agcolom> hi! in the jqm docs, we have a section to explain how to bind events to the container, see http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-events.html
[09:00:05] <agcolom> and then we have the custom events
[09:00:23] <agcolom> but the new api docs doesn't allow for this...
[09:00:41] <agcolom> so for now I have only put the custom widget event.
[09:01:12] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't allow for which part?
[09:01:15] <agcolom> do you think this is something that would be worth adding?
[09:01:22] <agcolom> the 1st part
[09:01:38] <agcolom> Bind events directly to the container, typically a div element. Use jQuery Mobile's virtual events, or bind standard JavaScript events, like change, focus, blur, etc.:
[09:01:38] <agcolom> $( ".selector" ).bind( "collapse", function(event, ui) {
[09:01:38] <agcolom>   ...
[09:01:38] <agcolom> });
[09:02:07] <agcolom> because this is not associated with a specific event
[09:02:40] <agcolom> in the event section, I have the 3 events... but not that 1st part
[09:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> Do you thnk that the generic "you can bind to events" paragraph is necessary for every widget?
[09:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> In the current docs for UI, we show both callback and event binding examples: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog#events
[09:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> Would that be better?
[09:05:18] <agcolom> I am not sure, I was just wondering... just checked your solution: I loke it!!!!
[09:05:21] <agcolom> like!!!
[09:05:23] <agcolom> ^
[09:05:56] <agcolom> Yes, That's really neat!
[09:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, maybe we can automate that (it's automated in the old docs).
[09:06:37] <agcolom> yes, that'd be great! thank you :-)
[09:07:07] <agcolom> I am also struggling with the event attributes...
[09:08:01] <agcolom> Can I show you some code to check?
[09:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> sure, one sec
[09:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's easy to document, I'll find an example.
[09:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/4592d46f5821044af56d12d53d03d08abe250555/entries/accordion.xml#L93-111
[09:09:35] <agcolom> Yes, I've got your example. It's with the jqm code that I'm not sure...
[09:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[09:10:09] <agcolom> in jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.js
[09:10:25] <agcolom> (I am looking at the collapsible)
[09:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so it looks like collapsible doesn't send any data for any of its events: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/collapsible.js#L144
[09:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> So in that case you'd have something simple like this: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries/dialog.xml#L115-123
[09:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> You'll always have event and ui
[09:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> But ui might be empty.
[09:13:47] <agcolom> ok, thanks... I was wondering whether the ui would be collapsibleHeading and collapsibleContent? (for the create event) but I have no idea... So you think ui is empty?
[09:15:08] <scott_gonzalez> There would have to be additional parameters passed, like this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.accordion.js#L403
[09:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> In order for ui to not be empty.
[09:16:28] <agcolom> perfect! Thank you!!!!
[09:24:35] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: sorry one more question. On the example you have just given me: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries/dialog.xml#L115-123 the event has a type. Do I need to have a type for the event as well, and what should it be? (in your example, for example there is 	<event name="open" type="dialogopen"> )
[09:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, every event needs a type.
[09:25:27] <scott_gonzalez> The type is generally widget name + callback name.
[09:25:44] <scott_gonzalez> but the prefix can be changed by the widget.
[09:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> And if the prefix and the callback name are the same, there's no prefixing.
[09:26:08] <agcolom> ok, do I define that or is this defined somewhere?
[09:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's defined in the actual widget code.
[09:26:38] <agcolom> ok, I'll look for it... thank you!
[09:26:45] <agcolom> very much!!!!
[09:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> I don't konw if mobile uses any custom prefixes.
[09:27:46] <agcolom> Ah! maybe I need to check with johnbender...
[09:31:52] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ping
[09:34:20] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: that's a very weird error.
[09:37:55] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: no idea, actually. can I be given steps to reproduce? would be better than a screenshare.
[09:38:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I can commit what I have.
[09:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Deploy jqueryui.com, it'll create two pages: /upgrade-guide and /upgrade-guide/1.9
[09:42:51] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: reproduced, looking now.
[09:43:09] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: sigh. I was looking at the wrong line number.
[09:43:14] <nacin> transposed two of them.
[09:45:52] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:54:18] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: pushed a commit. the static index plugin was not expecting a situation where it would be active but no 'index' page was created yet.
[09:54:37] <nacin> looking through web-base-template github issues now
[09:54:42] <nacin> for other things
[09:56:50] <scott_gonzalez> much better :-) thanks
[10:54:37] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: the blog.jqueryui.com theme doesn't exist, but that's what it's set to in domains.php. just a heads up.
[10:55:17] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Thanks for the heads up, I think the plan is to actually merge all blogs into a single site.
[11:28:44] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: resolved a few more issues.
[11:28:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm verifying one for you right now.
[11:30:15] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/53#issuecomment-7698808
[11:31:02] <nacin> okay. works for me.
[11:31:30] <nacin> very likely https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/77bc406#L1R6
[11:33:35] <scott_gonzalez> We really need to get some better styling on this page: http://dev.jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[11:33:46] <scott_gonzalez> And of course that link won't work for most people :-P
[11:34:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can we get stage setup?
[11:34:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yup
[11:35:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: re: color - do whatever we need to with version.txt - seems to make sense since the version is in package.json now, also - does it need a plugins site manifest?
[11:35:37] <scott_gonzalez> I think we can delete version.txt, I didn't see any references to it.
[11:35:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the old makefile used it, i don't think the gruntfile does
[11:36:09] <scott_gonzalez> I created a manifest grunt task to generate the manifest (must be run after updating the version in package.json).
[11:36:32] <scott_gonzalez> The way we're handling this in UI is:
[11:36:38] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout -b release
[11:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> # update package.json version
[11:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> grunt manifest
[11:36:54] <scott_gonzalez> git add whatever
[11:37:03] <scott_gonzalez> git commit -m "Tagging 2.0.0."
[11:37:06] <scott_gonzalez> git tag 2.0.0
[11:37:10] <scott_gonzalez> git push --tags
[11:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout master
[11:37:18] <gnarf> k
[11:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> git branch -D release
[11:37:51] <scott_gonzalez> We don't actually do the `git branch -D` since we run from a fresh clone and then just throw away the clone.
[11:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> But if you were going to release from your own checkout, that would be the process.
[11:38:33] <scott_gonzalez> So the manifest file exists in the tag, but never exists in a public branch.
[11:38:58] <gnarf> k
[11:52:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://code.jquery.com/color/jquery.color-2.0.0.js
[11:52:20] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:53:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/commits/2.0.0
[11:53:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'll pull that into UI today and close out #6969
[11:53:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, just checked out the commit. Looks good.
[11:53:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's so nice to have that wrapped up :D
[11:53:42] <gnarf> agree
[11:53:50] <gnarf> now i guess I gotta write a blog about it
[11:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> Good job.
[11:53:55] <scott_gonzalez> Indeed.
[11:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> CHECK OUT ALL THE NEW HOTNESS!
[12:04:27] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: pm fine?
[12:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:15:01] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Which site were you working on that had the styled hr?
[12:15:31] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it was the API site, but I can't seem to find any sytled hrs.
[12:15:49] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: api.jqueryui.com … the change was probably in the base.css in web-base-template
[12:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> What page has an hr on it?
[12:19:58] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: looks like i either didn't commit that change or it got overwritten … looking for it now
[12:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you know about the plans for 1-8.api.jqueryui.com?
[12:26:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no
[12:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> So the plan is for the 1-8 branch (https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/tree/1-8) to power 1-8.api...
[12:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> And we'll host docs for multiple major versions at the same time.
[12:33:12] <scott_gonzalez> Meh, thoughts? http://cl.ly/image/0T3U2m433W3l kborchers gnarf kswedberg
[12:33:49] <scott_gonzalez> This is the index page, replacing the ungodly list of everything.
[12:34:25] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i like it … i think that ungodly list needs to be somewhere though, with a way to filter it
[12:34:53] <scott_gonzalez> good point
[12:35:08] <scott_gonzalez> When I first started using jQuery, I read the API docs from A - Z.
[12:36:10] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we can do something like /category/all ? nacin
[12:36:36] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i can't find where i added hr's but there were pretty much at the top of every page under the title based on the mockups. i probably rebased over the change at some point
[12:36:47] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: you could hack in a /category/all, or just assign every post to "all" (probably less ideal)
[12:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:36:49] <kborchers> and yes, /category/all i think would be perfect for that
[12:38:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: probably pretty easy to just add them to an "All" category and then just not display that category on each entry unless there are other drawbacks i don't know about
[12:40:55] <nacin> kborchers: doable, though we could probably do it a bit more elegantly
[12:41:24] * kborchers defers to the expert ;)
[12:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Would a category/all page work or would having a page with that name not be the best solution?
[12:42:19] <nacin> if you wanted to do a page, that'd work
[12:42:30] <nacin> though you'd need to create a 'category' page too (which could list all categories)
[12:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, is that supposed to work right now?
[12:43:13] <nacin> no, we don't handle that, but you could do it if you wanted (with say a page template)
[12:43:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, ok.
[12:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I was planning on using a page template to implement /category/all.
[12:43:39] <scott_gonzalez> I can do that for /category as well.
[12:50:06] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/e28e91ebb5dfe018a936
[12:51:23] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to get property of non-object in <b>/Users/scottgonzalez/Projects/wordpress-jquery-network/wp-includes/query.php</b> on line <b>3129</b>
[12:51:42] <scott_gonzalez> if ( in_array( $cat_obj->term_id, $category ) )
[12:53:26] <nacin> huh. works for me.
[13:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I can't seem to get this to work. I tried changing the conditional:
[13:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> if ( $query->is_main_query() && $query->query['category_name'] === 'all' ) {
[13:15:04] <nacin> which theme is this against?
[13:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> api.jquery.com
[13:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that get_queried_object() can't find the term "all"
[13:25:25] <nacin> yeah, almost done with a fix
[13:29:02] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/e28e91ebb5dfe018a936
[13:29:06] <nacin> had to work around an oddity in the theme
[13:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Still getting the same error.
[13:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: http://cl.ly/image/362N22071R2d
[13:46:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: looks good, though did you remove the category listing fro the right? if that was there then you could probably do without the bullets right?
[13:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's still on the right.
[13:46:48] <kborchers> i guess it doesn't hurt to have it in both places
[13:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the list is small.
[13:47:25] <scott_gonzalez> If it was a long list, it wouldn't make sense to duplicate.
[13:47:36] <kborchers> right, i think that works. looks good :)
[13:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: This is what we're thinking of for the jQuery UI index page: http://cl.ly/image/362N22071R2d
