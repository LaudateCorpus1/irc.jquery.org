[06:41:51] <mikesherov_> tj_vantoll: jzaefferer what are your thoughts on: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10534#comment:2
[06:42:33] <tj_vantoll> Seems reasonable.
[06:45:58] <mikesherov_> what I really want to know is if that's something that should wait for a major version
[06:46:02] <mikesherov_> tj_vantoll: ^
[06:46:23] <mikesherov_> even though it's undocumented, typically that would be something we'd do at 1.12 for example
[06:46:42] <tj_vantoll> I'd say it's worth waiting, even though it's undocumented.
[06:47:00] <mikesherov_> k
[06:47:14] <tj_vantoll> We're not planning on waiting too long for 1.12 because we have a breaking menu regression we have to address.
[06:47:58] <mikesherov_> but wouldn't that be 1.11.1 ?
[06:48:05] <mikesherov_> tj_vantoll: ^
[06:48:36] <tj_vantoll> To fix it we have to change menu's required markup structure, which we only do with major releases.
[06:49:19] <tj_vantoll> We removed the anchor tag requirement in 1.11, but as it turns out we need to add *some* wrapper back.
[06:49:57] <tj_vantoll> And we need users to specify those wrappers, so it's essentially an API change.
[06:50:23] <mikesherov_> I see
[06:50:36] <mikesherov_> added this then: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10536#comment:1
[06:50:41] <mikesherov_> jzaefferer: ^
[06:51:41] <tj_vantoll> So it looks like you're trying to avoid globally exposing functionality that we don't document?

[06:52:37] <mikesherov_> tj_vantoll: the interactions stuff is a pile of garbage
[06:52:37] <tj_vantoll> Which I think is a good idea btw.
[06:52:42] <tj_vantoll> lol
[06:52:51] <mikesherov_> lots of the exposed stuff there is exposed just because
[06:52:57] <mikesherov_> with no forethought or reason
[06:53:24] <mikesherov_> $.ui.intersect would be good to expose if it wasn't tailored specifically for droppables
[06:53:31] <mikesherov_> but unfortunately, it is
[06:54:05] <tj_vantoll> We should hide $.ui.intersect in 1.12 then. I don't know if there's much point in deprecating an undocumented ‚Äúfeature‚Äù.
[06:54:23] <mikesherov_> I see
[06:54:27] <mikesherov_> good point
[06:54:30] <tj_vantoll> imo at least
[06:55:00] <mikesherov_> closed it

[13:23:12] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: pong
[13:28:47] <tj_vantoll> paul_irish: fyi scott_gonzalez is on vacation this week
[13:39:48] <tpyo> sorry for asking this as the sample works fine from the download but I'm having some sort of trouble with autocomplete in my project, I saw a SO post where others experienced the same issue, the function isn't found and is actually just an empty string. Is it possible this is a common problem or just likely that it's my bad?
[13:46:00] <tpyo> <- ignore this fool, was issue between chair and keyboard
[15:38:54] <gseguin> arschmitz: ping
[22:14:11] <s5fs> arschmitz: I'm patching hosts, looks like the staging server for the ui builder isn't working quite right with jquery 1.11:  http://stage.download.jqueryui.com/download
[23:22:31] <mz_> I have a question about JQuery UI 1.11: I noticed that after updating to it, Selenium-based tests that use actions.dragAndDrop (or clickAndHold followed by move) no longer work -- does anyone know what changes to event handling since 1.10.4 might have caused this?
