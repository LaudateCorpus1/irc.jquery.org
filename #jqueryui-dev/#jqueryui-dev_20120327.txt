[10:33:36] <gyzmodo> I've translated jQuery UI datepicker plugin. Now how can i upload that to official jQuery UI website?
[10:40:46] <ajpiano> you file a pull requset
[10:41:06] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls
[10:43:23] <gyzmodo> i've never used github, but i've account there
[10:43:33] <ajpiano> now is a good time to start
[10:43:44] <ajpiano> gyzmodo: http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-jquery-bug-fixing-guide/
[10:45:04] <gyzmodo> I am using Windows 7
[10:45:44] <ajpiano> well, you can setup git and a server, etc. there as well.
[10:46:47] <gyzmodo> hehe
[10:46:57] <gyzmodo> i've only shared hosting
[10:51:03] <ajpiano> you don't need to host it anywhere, you run a local development server
[10:51:55] <gyzmodo> i am downloading official portable Gi for Windows 7
[10:52:18] <ajpiano> gyzmodo: for the record, i don't think anyone here is going to be able to help you through the rudiments of getting started with git
[10:52:24] <ajpiano> btw, which language did you do a translation for
[10:52:34] <gyzmodo> Uzbek language

[11:54:54] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (5d, 3h ago): Datepicker: Added Georgian localization. Fixes #8205 - Datepicker: Add Georgian localization.
[11:55:20] <gyzmodo> really?
[11:55:31] <scott_gonzalez> If you're having trouble with git, I do make an exception for translations. You can just file a ticket and paste the i18n file into the ticket.
[11:56:01] <gyzmodo> i've opened your link
[11:56:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: are you on #jquery today?
[11:56:25] <scott_gonzalez> Every day :-)
[11:56:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: if so - scroll up and read the comments from tasuki about animate class in 1.8
[11:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> 24 hrs/wk dedicated now :-D
[11:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you mean the actual #jquery channel...scrolling up
[11:57:14] <gnarf> basically https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/e8ba367a58995b191706e5682eacba534cd25697 needs to be backported to 1-8-stable
[11:57:14] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by gnarf37 (5m, 3w ago): Effects: fixing an animateClass issue when the class was empty
[11:57:18] <gyzmodo> so?
[11:57:26] <gnarf> which is really really simple fix, i can push if you like
[11:59:06] <gyzmodo> scott_gonzalez, so i've opened your link
[12:05:31] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Hmm..wonder how that didn't get merged into 1-8-stable.
[12:05:37] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it shouldn't have caused a conflict.
[12:05:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that function was totally rewritten by me
[12:06:13] <gnarf> so 1.9 and 1.8 are way diverged inside there
[12:06:20] <gnarf> the backported fix is simple tho
[12:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> umm...wait. I thought this was fixed.
[12:06:57] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check.
[12:08:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/commit/49c9fad
[12:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, ok. Here's the ticket to reference: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8113
[12:08:10] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by gnarf37 (1m, 36s ago): Backporting e8ba367a58995b191706e5682eacba534cd25697 to 1-8-stable
[12:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> I knew I had seen this recently.
[12:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> Can you just fix the commit message: "Effects: Fixed ... Fixes #8113 ..."
[12:09:13] <gnarf> yeah yeah
[12:09:19] <gnarf> just did , ill push to stable too
[12:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[12:09:31] <gnarf> testing :)
[12:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> So if this bug exists in 1-8-stable, that means it's been broken forever, right?
[12:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> 1-8-stable doesn't have any of the rewrite, does it?
[12:10:17] <gnarf> nope
[12:10:21] <gnarf> cuz it uses deferred
[12:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> Strange that it took this long to get noticed.
[12:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> And then two people noticed it.

[12:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like a lot of people should've run into this sooner.
[12:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, not quite right, but good enough :-P
[12:11:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: tell me now before i push it onto upstream
[12:11:57] <scott_gonzalez> The "Fixes #xxx - yyy" is what gets picked up by my script for the changelog.
[12:12:04] <gnarf> aha
[12:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> wiki.jqueryui.com/Commit-Message-Style-Guide
[12:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> the yyy should be the ticket description.
[12:12:27] <gnarf> effects: backport.... - Fixes #8113 - addClass not animating
[12:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's good.
[12:13:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://jsfiddle.net/Z6mJU/146/ - with my file
[12:14:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/commit/e220cf2 better? :)

[12:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, though the fiddle is still broken.
[12:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> oh, it's working. You had effects loaded 3 times.
[12:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> I changed it to just use your file and it's working.
[12:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> Effects core won't load multiple times. It bails if it detects that it already exists...
[12:17:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://jsfiddle.net/Z6mJU/147/ - srry :)
[12:18:24] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, that's still loading jquery-ui-git :-P
[12:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/Z6mJU/148/
[12:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, it's working. So push :-)
[12:21:10] <gnarf> fuck
[12:21:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can you change my password on ui trac?
[12:21:40] <gnarf> i dunno why, but it wont let me log in

[12:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yup.
[12:24:38] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[12:58:40] <gnarf> rworth / scott_gonzalez: btw - I have use for the "mask datepicker" variant on this project I'm working on

[15:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> Check out that commit.
[15:06:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah - it is pretty nice - not quite what i expected from it, but still VERY useful
[15:06:55] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #297: STILL FAILING in 32 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/297/
[15:06:55] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Accordion: Added animation tests.
[15:07:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: btw... $.when( panels ).done()
[15:07:14] * gnarf winks
[15:07:30] <scott_gonzalez> meh
[15:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> I had originally planned to chain the whole thing.
[15:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> But decided not to since I would've had to .find() to get to the element with the promise.
[15:08:43] <scott_gonzalez> Another awesome thing about .promise() is that you can listen for the end of an animation even if your jQuery object might contain 0 elements.
[15:08:52] <gnarf> yup
[15:09:28] <gnarf> I personally think $.when( collection ).done() vs collection.promise().done()
[15:09:50] <gnarf> but it doesn't make much difference
[15:10:04] <gnarf> also .fn.promise is 1.6+ right?
[15:10:05] <gnarf> ?promise
[15:10:05] <bot-t> .promise([type], [target]): [New in v1.6] Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[15:10:09] <gnarf> yeah coo
[15:10:23] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[15:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> GAH. This is so frustrating.
[15:10:46] <gnarf> the thing i don't like about .promise() is that animations added after .promise() will delay the resolution
[15:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> I can *finally* cross off a full item from the roadmap, but pbwiki keeps failing to save.
[15:11:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: boo
[15:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 504 (Gateway Time-out)
[15:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> Accordion is DONE!
[15:18:19] <gnarf> prolly more fun than my current project: http://cl.ly/0l1y3J3o3i3I2q1P3J2Y ;)
