[05:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: You around today?
[06:26:27] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yes. and, https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/5787a3066dab8b51548ef30a2f7362f05d067c94
[06:26:28] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on web-base-template by Andrew Nacin (2m, 46s ago): Fix hierarchical URLs for plugins.jquery.com.
[06:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[06:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> I feel dumb.
[06:27:54] <scott_gonzalez> Let met test.
[06:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> works
[06:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: What do we need to do to make these site-specific
[06:30:30] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: do we plan to support more custom urls than stage.*?
[06:30:50] <nacin> like .dev, etc.
[06:31:04] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to support {custom}.*
[06:31:14] <scott_gonzalez> Let me find what I had before.
[06:31:55] <nacin> so, that's fun, because it means the gw-resources redirect will need to remove {custom}
[06:32:09] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: https://gist.github.com/2a33378faf5b3accfc7f
[06:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Why?
[06:32:36] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: nginx or apache won't know the value of JQUERY_STAGING_PREFIX
[06:32:46] <nacin> unless we don't care about that part.
[06:32:56] <nacin> or, if we expect gw-resources to not always use the live domain
[06:33:07] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I assume we'd use $host in the redirect.
[06:33:21] <scott_gonzalez> gw-resoruces is using $HTTP_HOST
[06:33:23] <nacin> got it.
[06:33:24] <scott_gonzalez> So it's dynamic.
[06:33:28] <nacin> that makes the nginx redirect a bit cleaner.
[06:33:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[06:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> I assume the redirect is really simple, I just haven't gotten to it yet.
[06:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like it'll be really clean in nginx.
[06:33:58] <nacin> I had an alias in nginx that parsed out 'stage.'
[06:34:49] <nacin> Just took that out. It's now a one-line location block
[06:36:25] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[06:36:49] <nacin> I mean, it was previously only five lines. :)
[06:38:04] <nacin> Okay, I have the rule in both nginx and apache now. Let's make these plugins site-specific, then pull as much config into web-base-template as possible.
[06:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good to me.
[06:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Let me know when you're ready to wrok on the configs, I'd like to go over it with you to make sure we're on the same page.
[06:43:37] <nacin> sounds good.
[06:45:29] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell ajpiano We need to fire out what content (documentation) needs to exist on the plugins site https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/34
[06:45:30] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[06:46:13] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #535: FAILURE in 1 min 4 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/535/
[06:48:04] <nacin> Closed #36, ready for configs.
[06:48:48] <jzaefferer> I'm testing the -git deploy right now, that's why the build is failing
[06:48:50] <jzaefferer> permissions!
[06:49:40] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: do you want plugins.jquery.com/the-plugin-name/ or plugins.jquery.com/the-plugin-name
[06:49:46] <nacin> not sure how you guys feel about trailing slashes
[06:50:24] <scott_gonzalez> I originally assumed no trailing slash, but I don't actually care.
[06:50:46] <nacin> WordPress transparently handles either-or. It uses whatever the permalink structure is.
[06:50:51] <scott_gonzalez> I especially don't care since WP recognizes both.
[06:51:00] <nacin> It'll do a canonical redirect, depending.
[06:51:34] <scott_gonzalez> I assume people will expect the slash to not be there.
[06:52:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: look, deployed by jenkins just now: http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js
[06:52:31] <jzaefferer> and http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.css
[06:52:43] <nacin> Okay. It's about 3 lines of code to enforce no trailing slashes everywhere. Up to you guys.
[06:52:49] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: AWESOME
[06:53:40] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Let's leave it for now, we can change it if it bothers people.
[06:53:58] <nacin> That's fine. Just pushed a commit that enforced /postname on the plugins site, and did it without a slash.
[06:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:54:28] <nacin> oh by the way, since you guys have been following /trunk, you should now switch to the 3.4 branch
[06:55:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I figure we'll just settle on stable now.
[06:55:58] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[06:55:58] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #536: FIXED in 6 min 13 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/536/
[06:56:38] <scott_gonzalez> If there's a puppet task for installing WordPress, we should just install 3.4.
[06:57:37] <nacin> stable is fine, too. we do keep the branch stable, under the assumption that others use it in lieu of a tag. it's arguably always going to be more solid than the stable, as it will at most get a few major bug fixes and any security releases.
[06:58:05] <nacin> we normally don't reach 21 minor releases :)
[06:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[06:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'm hoping to stop at 22...
[06:58:32] <nacin> you guys have a timeline for 1.9 yet?
[06:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> Aiming for 1.9b in a week.
[06:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9 final very soon after.
[06:59:05] <nacin> nice. when 1.9b drops, we'll get it into our trunk.
[06:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[06:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> There will be jQuery 1.8b at the same time.
[06:59:49] <nacin> it'll be a party.
[07:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9b will ship with 1.7.2, but 1.9 will ship with 1.8.
[07:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> There are 4 FT devs for WordPress?
[07:02:30] <nacin> depends on how you count, yes
[07:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you guys bang out tickets at a much faster rate than us.
[07:03:19] <nacin> we also have more tickets lying around. don't envy us. :-)
[07:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> You should install the ticket graph pluign.
[07:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph
[07:03:59] <nacin> I think that would make me cry.
[07:04:49] <scott_gonzalez> This makes me cry: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph?days=1500
[07:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> But this is a good sign: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph?days=90
[07:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> We're improving.
[07:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> And we've got a bunch of "drop back-compat" tickets at this point, so that will go away :-)
[07:06:30] <nacin> you guys have any other plugins you like?
[07:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> Just the graph.
[07:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> And my custom report, which you already saw: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/29
[07:07:18] <nacin> yeah, we have a number of custom reports. they're all raw SQL
[07:07:42] <nacin> and you've seen our keyword dropdown, I imagine.
[07:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:09:35] <nacin> that's part of a number of templating changes we made. also gravatars, etc.
[07:09:36] <scott_gonzalez> Core might like that, they use keywords like needsdocs.
[07:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> gravatars are nice
[07:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> The same name rule for categories is that you can't have two categories with the same name and the same parent?
[07:11:16] <nacin> the keywords are also user role-specific. even though it's ultimately a raw input field, I see more keywords than others.
[07:11:44] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: same name and same parent?
[07:11:57] <scott_gonzalez> For taxonomies.
[07:12:18] <nacin> but different slugs, then, I imagine
[07:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[07:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> We get errors if there are multiple categories with the same name, different slugs.
[07:12:46] <nacin> by default, I doubt we allow for it, which is what I assume you are seeing. but I also imagine there is a way around it.
[07:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> I assume that's per parent term.
[07:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we have a case where we want to work around it.
[07:13:15] <scott_gonzalez> I just want to validate against it before trying to sync.
[07:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> So I want to make sure I'm validating properly.
[07:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> So far I think we've only run into it with Uncategorized, which we've already solved.
[07:13:54] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd like to check for it in grunt-wordpress before trying to sync.
[07:14:04] <nacin> yeah, if you are over-cautious in your validating, you'll be fine.
[07:15:15] <nacin> term_exists() does check both slug and name.
[07:15:24] <nacin> also parent.
[09:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Ready for the config stuff?
[09:12:05] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: Yep.

[10:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Can you tell me what's wrong with the build?
[10:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know where these JSHint tests are coming from.
[10:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Any idea how to find out what's going on in Jenkins?
[10:06:09] <scott_gonzalez> At least it's not screwing up our TestSwarm results :-)
[10:24:09] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I'll take a quick look
[10:24:42] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: give me one second to put my daughter down for a nap
[10:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[10:33:07] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: you guys do some async js loading for your tests, including for linting, and it looks like in this case jshint failed to load for one reason or another
[10:33:35] <johnbender> I doubt that's very much help to you but that's what it looks like
[10:33:51] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:34:04] <scott_gonzalez> I don't lint effects files though.
[10:34:09] <johnbender> although it does tell you that the message isn't from a legit test failure, though I suppose it could be hiding one
[10:35:48] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I do.
[10:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.

[15:21:46] <jzaefferer> with a few additional lines in the testswarm-multi-jquery, we can cover a few other jQuery versions as well
