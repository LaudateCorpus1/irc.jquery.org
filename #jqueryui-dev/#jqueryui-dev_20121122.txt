[00:49:29] <_zoggy_> is there any stress testing demos.. like loading up 2000 jui progress bars and setting them to different values
[01:29:23] <jzaefferer> gnarf: jQuery UI 1.8 core job fails with http://swarm.jquery.org/result/503868 Invalid Argument at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/jquery-1.8.0.js#L4436 in the "Parse of null for options" test. Any idea what's going on there?
[01:29:39] <gnarf> damnit, forgot to do that today
[01:30:00] <gnarf> there is an object being created that needs to have an "outerWidth" and "outerHeight" property
[01:30:09] <gnarf> it's causing a NaN
[01:30:16] * gnarf looks now
[01:30:22] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[01:33:36] <jzaefferer> gnarf: there's another one. "jQuery UI 1-9 1.7 core" job http://swarm.jquery.org/result/504092 again Invalid argument, here at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-9-stable/tests/jquery-1.7.js#L8881 in the "effects.size: show/hide" test
[01:39:13] <gnarf> running effects/all.html right now in ie8
[01:39:18] <gnarf> i think i got it
[01:40:06] <gnarf> i'm not even really sure size should have a show/hide
[01:40:07] <gnarf> but
[01:40:15] <gnarf> its actually a really lame effect
[01:40:18] <gnarf> :)

[01:52:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can I just kill the size effect? please? 
[01:52:44] <gnarf> we can keep scale and puff
[01:52:45] <gnarf> but
[01:52:54] <gnarf> size is too silly now
[01:53:08] <gnarf> doesn't conform to like any of the other effects

[02:00:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: another <base>!
[02:00:36] <gnarf> mikesherov: do you have a polite "bug # and unit test" message prepared for that one? ^^^
[02:01:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i actually just had an idea for isLocal
[02:04:55] <gnarf> the <base> tag issue is too prevalant
[02:06:46] <gnarf> I can kinda sympathize with this problem
[02:07:59] <gnarf> if you had a base, and do <a href="#content"> --- tabs wont correctly use #content --- granted, its techincally poiting to #content on the base href, but how else do you wire the tab up to its local content without rewriting the href to be based on window.location instead?
[02:08:24] <gnarf> seems like a lot of work
[02:08:34] <gnarf> <a href="#content" data-local="true"> ?
[02:09:52] * gnarf shrugs
[02:09:55] <gnarf> seems we need to solve this

[02:17:49] <gnarf> jzaefferer: ^^^^
[02:23:31] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I'm not attached to the size effect. If it sucks, we should at least deprecate it in 1.10. I'd leave it to scott_gonzalez to decide if we can just kill it instantly.
[02:24:39] <jzaefferer> gnarf: PR looks okay to me. I wonder if that issue would ever occur outside of unit tests though.
[02:26:37] <gnarf> if you passed a to/from option for size
[02:26:44] <gnarf> which is like the only way that makes sense
[02:26:49] <gnarf> you need outerHeight and outerWidth
[02:27:18] <gnarf> there are so many problems in this set of effects
[02:28:57] <gnarf> but this is like the show/hide part thats getting messy
[02:28:57] <gnarf> so
[02:29:07] <gnarf> i'm not so sure that it can happen outside
[02:29:16] <gnarf> this code is chaos ;)
[02:29:40] <jzaefferer> okay, let's just land this
[02:29:49] <jzaefferer> and go from there

[02:38:57] <gnarf> jzaefferer: were we having fails when we were at 2 builds ?
[02:39:38] <gnarf> is it possible to assign the phantom only builds to a separate queue in jenkins you think?
[02:39:55] <gnarf> because this mobile phantom is like 1:20 to run and is slowing down this test :)
[02:40:41] <gnarf> oh well, it only estimates 4 minutes
[02:40:43] <gnarf> :)
[02:44:21] <jzaefferer> maybe we can add a worker for phantom-only tests. Never done that before
[02:46:41] <jzaefferer> looking into it right now
[02:54:47] <jzaefferer> gnarf: apparently slaves need a complete Jenkins instance running :/
[02:56:24] <jzaefferer> gnarf: looks like this might help, with a by-category: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Throttle+Concurrent+Builds+Plugin
[02:56:52] <gnarf> so we could setup a category for anything browserstack and limit that to 1
[02:57:00] <gnarf> and then have 2 executors?
[02:58:35] <gnarf> hrm
[02:58:42] <gnarf> i can't repro http://swarm.jquery.org/result/507493 on ie9 browserstack
[03:00:45] <jzaefferer> yeah, that's the idea. I've installed that plugin and scheduled a restart. Will probably take a few hours before it finishes all the currently scheduled jobs
[03:01:16] <gnarf> and now it cleared itself up...
[03:02:46] <jzaefferer> I cancelled all the pending jobs :-)

[03:24:54] <gnarf> so um
[03:24:58] <gnarf> restart?
[03:25:14] <gnarf> it just is saying "going to shut down" but it hasn't actually shut down yet

[08:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: People just need to learn how to use <base> if they're going to use it.
[08:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> Presumably they're writing every single anchor with absolute URLs EXCEPT for their tabs.
[08:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> Which is dumb.
[10:05:54] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: That's not really tenable though. How is someone supposed to use local loading if they have a base tag imposed by their framework?
[10:06:13] <scott_gonzalez> Use an absolute URL.
[10:06:42] <mikesherov> But do you think that's intuitive?
[10:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if they ever want a local link to work, it has to be.
[10:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> But, no, I don't think <base> is intuitive at all.
[10:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> I think people are crazy for using it.
[10:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> And they should stop doing so.
[10:08:03] <mikesherov> Frameworks
[10:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> Those frameworks are crap.
[10:08:14] <mikesherov> Codeigniter uses it
[10:08:18] <mikesherov> I agree
[10:08:43] <mikesherov> But they exist, and reasonable people use them occasionally
[10:09:12] <scott_gonzalez> Can't they just update their URLs with JS before calling .tabs() ?
[10:09:13] <mikesherov> Number of dupes is a good indication of the prevalence of the issue
[10:09:23] <mikesherov> They COULD
[10:09:37] <mikesherov> But is it reasonable to assume they will?
[10:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the problem is that if we "fix" this, we're intentionally breaking the way anchors work.
[10:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> There is clearly defined behavior, and what we're doing is correct.
[10:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> This is like when people use the same id multiple times.
[10:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> The number of dupes for this is probably the same as the number of dupes for ids.
[10:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> Also: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4941
[10:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> There are people who understand.
[10:50:13] <Krinkle|detached> jzaefferer: fyi, I think executors was set to 4 at some point
[10:50:41] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I set that back to 1 at some point, because it was causing builds to fail, since the most recent runs have priority in testswarm.
[10:51:00] <Krinkle> and the browserstack limit of course.
[10:51:12] <Krinkle> gnarf: that sounds great, multiple categories.
[11:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: If you're comfortable doing it, can you try to get the 1.9.2 release out today or tomorrow?
[11:03:51] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: This is the only thing that still needs to be merged into 1-9-stable: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8828
[11:05:04] <scott_gonzalez> If not, I'll hopefully get to it on Monday.
[14:30:38] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'll give it a try tomorrow
[14:36:45] <gnarf> jzaefferer: let me land an update to color first
