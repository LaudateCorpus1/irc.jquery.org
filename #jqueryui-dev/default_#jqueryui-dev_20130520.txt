[07:00:22] <Dattz> Hello, I want to use jQueryUI's draggable and resizable in a magento installation on some images
[07:00:29] <Dattz> Draggable works fine.
[07:00:59] <Dattz> But, when I try to use both, only the later one takes effect
[07:01:11] <Dattz> for example: element.draggable().resizable();
[07:01:22] <Dattz> will only make the element resizable
[07:05:08] <Dattz> nvm, now the same code is working fine
[07:05:31] <scott_gonzalez> Dattz: draggable + resizable works. Please ask for help in #jquery or the forums.
[07:10:34] <Dattz> scott_gonzalez: It's something to do with the ui-resizable-handle divs that are created by jqueryUI
[07:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you probably don't want to do .draggable().resizable() since resizable wraps the image, but please move this discussion to the forums or #jquery.
[07:11:57] <Dattz> okay
[07:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> ngsilverman: Are you interested in digging into this? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13907
[08:04:14] <DaveMethvin> btw scott_gonzalez it looks like sortable calls refreshItems automagically in some cases
[08:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:05:11] <DaveMethvin> there still could be some issue with 2.0, although we've been testing against 2.0 and not edge
[08:05:21] <DaveMethvin> so maybe it's been fixe
[08:05:22] <DaveMethvin> d

[08:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: http://cl.ly/image/0v3y080U3t2a
[08:45:01] <tj_vantoll> I like the formatting better but the "jQuery.ui.keyCode" heading nested within a "jQuery.ui.keyCode" box is a bit odd.
[08:45:38] <tj_vantoll> Although I guess that's what we do elsewhere.
[08:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> That's just what happens for property entries: http://api.qunitjs.com/Qunit.config/
[08:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> It only seems strange because there's no "signature" http://api.jqueryui.com/addClass/
[08:47:01] <tj_vantoll> Yep, ok. It's the lack of signature and also that the image only shows a small section of the page. It looks less odd seeing a full page.
[08:47:01] <tj_vantoll> +1
[08:48:44] <scott_gonzalez> It's on stage now.
[08:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.ui.keyCode/
[08:50:46] <tj_vantoll> Looks good. Is there a standard for when to prefix the page name with jQuery and/or jquery.ui?
[08:51:15] <scott_gonzalez> If it's $.fn.x, there's no prefix.
[08:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> Everything else gets prefixed.
[08:51:39] <tj_vantoll> So why is widget prefixed?
[08:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's not $.fn.widget
[08:52:08] <tj_vantoll> Yeah realized that right after I typed it O_o
[08:52:12] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[10:22:04] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez have a moment to chat about https://github.com/jquery/standards/issues/19?
[10:22:36] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[10:22:59] <tj_vantoll> The automatic response is that web components are the solution, but what exactly does that mean in this context?
[10:23:12] <tj_vantoll> WebKit at least exposes its shadow DOM implementation of these implementations, but that doesn't solve the full issue.
[10:23:26] <tj_vantoll> er implementation of these *inputs*
[10:24:05] <scott_gonzalez> I think the idea is that you would replace their shadow DOM with your own custom shadow DOM.
[10:24:49] <tj_vantoll> But right now that's not supported anywhere correct?
[10:24:57] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not.
[10:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> We could try in WebKit.
[10:25:24] <scott_gonzalez> Well, specially we should try in Chrome or Canary.
[10:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's entirely possible that some browser vendors aren't aware this is even supposed to work.
[10:27:14] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, I could give that a shot.
[10:27:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how this ties into native validation.
[10:28:17] <tj_vantoll> WebKit lets you hide most everything now, but you still can't get things to work because you can't stop the behavioral from happening.
[10:29:30] <tj_vantoll> I don't believe any of the validation attributes are type specific.
[10:29:45] <tj_vantoll> <input type="text" min="1" value="0">
[10:30:19] <tj_vantoll> Nevermind looks like they are :)
[10:30:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they are.
[10:31:08] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I'm not sure how you're supposed to do custom elements for all the new input types anyway.
[10:31:17] <scott_gonzalez> Since they're just different values for the type attribute.
[10:31:22] <scott_gonzalez> Not actually different elements.
[10:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> We should post about this.
[10:31:43] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I doubt even if it allowed you to replace <input type="number"> with your own shadow root that it could maintain the validation.
[10:31:45] <tj_vantoll> And yeah.
[10:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure Hixie has fully thought this through.
[10:32:26] <tj_vantoll> I'll try to shadow-replace an <input> later. I expect failure.
[10:32:29] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: tj_vantoll good evening! I totally stole your style for the Mobile icon page ;-)
[10:33:01] <agcolom> I spotted that the demo pages on ui use self closing tags... 
[10:33:27] <scott_gonzalez> where?
[10:33:45] <agcolom> http://jqueryui.com/draggable/ view source
[10:33:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, if you mean the demos on jqueryui.com, that's unfortunately out of our control.
[10:33:53] <agcolom> (and all the other ones)
[10:33:57] <agcolom> yes
[10:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> jsdom is inserting those :-(
[10:34:29] <agcolom> oh!!!
[10:34:32] <tj_vantoll> agcolom Cool, consistency is good.
[10:34:53] * scott_gonzalez looks at icon docs now...
[10:35:14] <tj_vantoll> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/resources/icons-list.html#L4
[10:35:18] <agcolom> tj_vantoll: I loved your page ;-) I removed the border as we only have a few and our names are shorter
[10:35:40] <agcolom> so reduced the width of the span also
[10:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I'm just getting a directory listing.
[10:36:02] <scott_gonzalez> This is #140, right?
[10:36:02] <agcolom> Oh shame on me!!!! 
[10:36:13] <tj_vantoll> Yeah. https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/140
[10:36:33] <agcolom> Thanks for spotting that tj_vantoll !
[10:36:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, when I deploy that, I get a directory listing.
[10:36:54] <scott_gonzalez> Very strange.
[10:37:17] <agcolom> yes, that's why I use mobileicons not icons
[10:37:46] <agcolom> tj_vantoll: was that working for you? I was getting a directory listing too just like scott_gonzalez 
[10:38:45] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, very odd. Is there an icons directory?
[10:38:49] <scott_gonzalez> stupid MAMP
[10:38:56] <scott_gonzalez> Alias /icons/ "/Applications/MAMP/Library/icons/"
[10:39:18] <tj_vantoll> ah
[10:40:07] <agcolom> when I used your style I was getting an issue with the border...
[10:40:43] <agcolom> like double border (so just thicker) when the border is applied twice and a thin 1px one elsewhere
[10:42:13] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, I think I remember seeing that. I'll take a look and see if it looks ok with no border. I just wanted them to be distinguishable since UI has a LOT of icons.
[10:42:41] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...it's outside of MAMP too...
[10:44:14] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa, I have tons of apache processes running.
[10:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> kill 530 532 1077 1211 1212 1588 9458 9459 84018 90536 99389 99939
[10:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> That's a lot of apache...
[10:45:34] <agcolom> indeed!!!
[10:45:42] <tj_vantoll> wow
[10:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You should rename your page to icons and just update your apache config.
[10:46:15] <agcolom> ok... I'll need your hrlp for that if that's ok?
[10:46:26] <agcolom> or is it easy to do?
[10:46:34] <agcolom> (the apache config)
[10:46:51] <agcolom> help ^ not hrlp!
[10:47:16] <agcolom> dinnertime... back in 20 mins....
[10:48:40] <scott_gonzalez> You can kill the double border with `margin: -1px 0 0 -1px;`
[10:49:33] <tj_vantoll> *makes mental note*
[10:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It's easy :-) https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/5a076e0ea145a5538669
[10:51:47] <scott_gonzalez> Auto-aliasing all favicons seems super aggressive.
[10:52:12] <scott_gonzalez> I could understand if they were doing this stuff based on hostname.
[10:52:25] <scott_gonzalez> Setting up MAMP's URLs to work from localhost.
[10:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> But this seems crazy.
[10:53:18] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, but who would ever name a page or directory "icons"?
[10:54:22] <tj_vantoll> :)
[10:54:28] <tj_vantoll> For the <input> discussion I'll try to hijack an <input>'s shadow DOM tonight. I agree that we should start making some more noise about this.
[11:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[11:08:31] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: your gist is empty 
[11:09:00] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: sorry, it's not! 
[11:09:41] <agcolom> clicking on it was taking me to just https://gist.github.com so I copied your text instead...
[11:16:08] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: just realised I was on the wrong mac book! will get the other one in a minute and make the change! Thanks! 
[12:33:50] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I've made the change to httpd.conf but I still see the icon listing...
[12:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> Did you restart apache?
[12:34:21] <agcolom> no....
[12:34:34] <agcolom> ok, do I stop and then start again?
[12:34:44] <scott_gonzalez> Are you using MAMP?
[12:35:02] <agcolom> do I need to comment out also the <Directory> thing about icons?
[12:35:06] <agcolom> yes I use MAMP
[12:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> no
[12:35:21] <scott_gonzalez> Launch MAMP and there will be a button that says "Stop Servers"
[12:35:35] <scott_gonzalez> Click that, it'll prompt you for your password, then the lights will turn red.
[12:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> Whent they're red, click the button again (it'll now say "Start Servers")
[12:36:17] <agcolom> processing.... 
[12:36:35] <agcolom> green lights... trying local...
[12:37:04] <agcolom> all ok! Thanks! (again ;-) )
[12:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
