[09:03:53] <radicalbiscuit_> Halloo, I'm looking for info on how to build a custom version of jQuery UI locally. I need to be able to build it during an unattended deployment, and I can't find anything contemporary with the current build system.
[09:08:07] <radicalbiscuit_> I'm especially interested in knowing how to configure the components I want to include. I've gathered it probably has something to do with `node release-test.js` but I get errors, even after successfully building the dependencies, and I'm not sure how to go about configuring it to include only certain components. I know the online custom download builder can do it, but I don't want to keep the compiled version in my sour
[09:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> radicalbiscuit_: There's nothing special about jQuery UI.
[09:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> You need to use a something like require.js or webpack.
[09:48:11] <radicalbiscuit_> scott_gonzalez: Thanks for the reply. What's with the lack of build instructions/examples anywhere?
[09:49:00] <scott_gonzalez> Where did you look?
[09:49:29] <radicalbiscuit_> Everywhere. o_o
[09:50:02] <radicalbiscuit_> readme, wiki, forum, stackoverflow...
[09:50:31] <radicalbiscuit_> I even went to the second page of google results. That's dedication.
[09:51:14] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there is a link to http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/environments/amd/ on the homepage of jqueryui.com
[09:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> I agree it's not a super obvious link.
[09:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> Generally developers building their own bundles already know about things like AMD, or they just do custom concat scripts based on the listed dependencies.
[09:53:13] <radicalbiscuit_> I am new to the js source building and packing world. Thus far, we've been keeping our assets in the source code, and I'm working on remedying that. So that at least explains my inexperience.
[09:53:47] <radicalbiscuit_> UI is one of my two holdouts right now, and thanks to you, that won't be the case much longer.
[09:56:39] <radicalbiscuit_> The link contains a wealth of specific information I was missing out on. I really appreciate it. FYI, if it helps refine keywords and page headers, I was mostly using the terms "jquery-ui custom build" in various orders.
[10:32:11] <radicalbiscuit_> \quit So long and thanks for all the fish.
[10:32:23] <radicalbiscuit_> er...
