[03:17:24] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Grid: Small observable refactoring - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:06:12] <kborchers> ajpiano: did you survive the freenode implosion last night ;)
[06:06:12] <bot-t> (4 hours 39 mins ago) <ajpiano> tell kborchers yeah that's what i noticed as well, it seems to only be an issue selecting things from submenus. i've refactored things a bit in the course of developing.... ping me whenever you're around and see this
[06:25:20] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yt?
[07:15:00] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers, sup?
[07:16:13] <kborchers> i was going to ask a question about whether i should use hide: true or hide: "fadeOut" for the default in popup. i went with hide: "fadeOut" since it looked more self documenting but i can change it if we prefer the other way. i made the same note in the PR
[07:17:34] <kborchers> also, will you be at the meeting today?
[07:17:47] <jzaefferer> looks like a good choice
[07:18:16] <jzaefferer> the tooltip {show:true, hide:true} stuff is a bit odd
[07:18:37] <jzaefferer> maybe we should change that to fadeIn/Out and make the _show/_hide default just toggle show/hide?
[07:18:54] <kborchers> that's what i kind of thought but wanted to make sure.
[07:18:58] <kborchers> i think that would make sense
[07:19:35] <kborchers> although, does false allow for show/hide without animation?
[07:20:11] <kborchers> i guess defaults could still be fadeIn/Out and then you can just use false if you don't want effects
[07:20:37] <jzaefferer> right
[07:21:01] <jzaefferer> shouldn't matter for popup, but let's put that on the wiki for tooltip
[07:21:10] <jzaefferer> also https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/466/files#r134186
[07:21:11] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (2h, 56m ago): Popup: Added show/hide animations and a demo
[07:22:32] <kborchers> the reason i got rid of close was because it runs the effect when the page loads
[07:24:29] <jzaefferer> right, makes sense, but the change got rid of a little too much functionality
[07:34:53] <kborchers> jzaefferer: would this be acceptable http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/zXs2B/ ? I figured I would show you before pushing.
[07:36:38] <jzaefferer> meh
[07:36:55] <jzaefferer> that doesn't make a lot of sense...
[07:37:17] <jzaefferer> to start, boolean attributes are always kind of magic
[07:37:28] <jzaefferer> by looking at the call, you have no idea what it'll do
[07:37:36] <kborchers> i like unicorns ;)
[07:38:08] <kborchers> i see what you're saying ... just trying to think of a way to determine whether or not to use hide or _hide
[07:38:27] <jzaefferer> and apart from hiding and setting attributes, close also triggers a close event, which isn't very useful when the widget is just initialized
[07:39:09] <kborchers> true, hmmm
[07:40:26] <jzaefferer> extract the attribute stuff to a helper method, then in _create, do .hide() and call that helper?
[07:43:03] <kborchers> sorry was afk for a min. that makes sense. will do.
[07:43:19] <kborchers> will you be at the meeting? do you need any updates from me?
[07:43:30] <jzaefferer> I will be there, yeah
[07:43:50] <kborchers> this is the one wednesday a month where i have a conflicting meeting and i have to present at it so probably going to be in and out of the meeting today
[07:43:54] <jzaefferer> looks like Scott won't be
[07:44:03] <jzaefferer> okay, no problem
[07:44:51] <kborchers> datepicker fix was landed
[07:45:13] <kborchers> waiting on input from scott on the fraction issue with position
[07:45:26] <kborchers> menu stuff has all landed i believe
[07:45:56] <kborchers> then obviously starting to work on popup and then menubar
[07:46:18] <kborchers> i think that's all i have right now unless you need anything else
[07:47:04] <jzaefferer> nope, sounds good
[07:47:10] <jzaefferer> did you clone the spreadsheet on the agenda?
[07:47:22] <jzaefferer> I just started editing, then wondering if I'm editing last weeks agenda..
[07:47:39] <kborchers> nope
[07:47:44] <kborchers> it was already there
[07:48:21] <jzaefferer> odd
[07:48:42] <jzaefferer> is danheberden around?
[07:48:53] <jzaefferer> is there really nothing for infrastructure to work on?
[07:49:05] <danheberden> jzaefferer not ui specific, really
[07:49:40] <danheberden> i need to catch up with ajpiano on the learning site to see if I can help out
[07:50:29] <jzaefferer> okay
[07:50:32] <jzaefferer> any news on servers in general, the swarm.jquery.org box specifically?
[07:53:10] <danheberden> no, i've been getting my head above water in my day-job/personal shit, so it's been more just putting out fires 'n stuff
[08:01:58] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i had another thought the other day about the whole testswarm client automation thing we were talking about at the last meeting.
[08:03:11] <kborchers> i wonder if the browserstack.com folks would be willing/able to provide some sort of solution in exchange for a shoutout on the UI site or something. just a thought. might not hurt to ask.
[08:26:16] <jzaefferer> mhm, good point
[08:26:46] <jzaefferer> I think they contacted Scott some time ago (they're using UI a lot), I'd see if he wants to poke them
[08:29:42] <jzaefferer> kborchers: tabindex is added in open method, so not really necessary to remove it on create - not really an issue though either
[08:30:26] <jzaefferer> well, lines 206-210 should just stay in close
[08:39:21] <kborchers> crap, i think i'm going to throw myself a party the first time i submit a PR and you just land it ;)
[08:39:58] <gnarf> kborchers: those are rare ;)
[08:42:37] <kborchers> jzaefferer: updated
[08:44:49] <kborchers> ok, headed to my meeting. will try to be in the UI meeting on my iPad but will probably not be able to chime in.
[08:56:26] <jzaefferer> gnarf, can you unmute #jquery-meeting?
[08:56:34] <jzaefferer> I don't get why that channel needs to be muted anyway
[08:57:01] <gnarf> you don't have access to it?
[08:57:31] <jzaefferer> access?
[08:57:41] <gnarf> chanserv
[08:58:18] <gnarf> ajpiano / rworth - can someone get jzaefferer some access to #jquery-meeting ?
[08:58:42] <gnarf> and poentially give danheberden +RfaF so he can grant in the future? :)
[09:00:08] <danheberden> you kids and your freenode modes
[09:01:43] <gnarf> he just needs +f to be able to tweak others chanserv access
[09:59:03] <gnarf> jzaefferer: needs to be / should be are two very different coins there --- +m makes it quite obvious there isn't a meeting, and stops people from dropping in trying to drum up conversations :)
[10:00:41] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: i gave you privs on the channel, and gave you and dan both +f
[10:01:00] <ajpiano> jzaefferer assuming you are authed with nickserv, you can do /cs op #jquery-meeting etc and do what you need to do
[10:04:19] <jzaefferer> yeah, I need to look up the nickserv stuff again
[10:06:35] <gnarf> jzaefferer: the best way to auth
[10:06:40] <gnarf> is to set up server password
[10:06:47] <gnarf> nickname:password
[10:49:34] <gnarf> hey danheberden - can you let me peek at that services thing, that index page is really annoying me ;)
[12:04:37] * gnarf grumbles
[12:05:06] <gnarf> my last two 1.7 blockers are proving to be big code
[12:18:29] <scott_gonzalez> is it me or is this guy really dense? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7732
[12:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea what he expects the visual outcome of his fiddle to be
[12:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> he just keeps going on about the wrapper elements
[12:20:41] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/8rgfm/1/ maybe?
[12:21:22] <scott_gonzalez> that's the only thing I can think of, but he won't say what he wants

[21:38:47] <kborchers> ?tell ajpiano got it! the problem has to do with using _bind for our click binding on menu and popup. they step on each others toes. check out http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/qJcvB/ which looks like your issue. Then look at http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/VvZS4/  That fiddle uses files from 1.9m5 before we changed the menu bindings to use _bind. I also commented out your trigger override in popup cuz it caused an issue with the me
[21:38:48] <kborchers> dissapearing but i don't think that is part of the issue. sorry for the novel. ping me tomorrow to discuss a fix
[21:38:48] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[21:42:08] <kborchers> ?tell ajpiano one more thing, i had to create the popup before the menu again leading me to _bind and the order in which the binding are created, etc. sorry again for the text flood when you get this :P
[21:42:09] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
