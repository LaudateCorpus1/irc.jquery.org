[08:26:57] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Hey! Just wanted to let you know I'm on vacation for the rest of the week, so I won't be able to make tomorrow's meeting.
[08:27:31] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I'm still working on the selectmenu PR. I'm fixing the tests, and then I'll address your remaining review comments. After that, the PR will be ready for another round of review.
[08:27:51] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I have only one failure remaining, after which I'll start addressing your review comments.
[08:28:16] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I'll try to look into the PR during evenings ...
[08:54:58] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: Cool thank you for letting me know
[09:07:19] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: NP ... I'm actually on it now, because I'm backing up some pictures and while that's going on I can sneak a peek ...
[09:07:39] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Tests should be green, just doing a final full-on run to make sure ...
[09:11:03] <arschmitz> nice

[14:21:42] <agcolom> gabrielschulhof: have you tried to deploy api.jquerymobile.com recently? (even just locally)
[14:22:14] <agcolom> I've just tried locally and I'm getting segmentation fault! So I'm not sure whether it's something to do with the repo or with my setup
[14:23:04] <agcolom> I'm assuming I'm using wordpress 4.1 (http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/readme.html) and I'm not sure whether this is correct or I need an update.
[15:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Just view source on one of the pages and look at the <meta name="generator"> element.
[16:06:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I get WordPress 4.1-beta2-30788 
[16:07:23] <agcolom> thanks I didn't know about that way to find out :-)
