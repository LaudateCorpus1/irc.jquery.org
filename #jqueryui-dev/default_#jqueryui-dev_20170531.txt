[13:50:52] <mgol> scott_gonzalez arschmitz: hey guys, sth is seriously wrong with UI tests against core 1.7. They introduce significant load on our browsers pool on BrowserStack, those tests run for long hours, even days. Could someone have a look? Should I disable 1.7 testing in the meantime? See e.g. http://swarm.jquery.org/job/5498
[13:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure this is a new problem. I noticed it a few days ago.
[14:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like the jquery-1-7 module isn't getting loaded.
[14:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> mgol: Fixed

[14:10:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'm confused about how it only broke the 1.7 tests though.
[16:10:58] <mgol> thanks!
