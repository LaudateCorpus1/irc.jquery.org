[08:17:06] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, thanks.
[08:17:08] <rxaviers> ah! element = $( element || this.defaultElement || this )[ 0 ];
[08:20:53] <rxaviers> Is there any reason `constructor(options, element)` has been preferred instead of `constructor(element, options)`?
[08:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, because element is optional.
[08:22:34] <rxaviers> I had the feeling that element is "less" optional. But, I'm only speculating..

[08:24:40] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Invoking a widget constructor with no parameters at all won't do what you expect.
[08:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> This has a lot to do with the awkwardness of inheritance.

[08:27:48] <rxaviers> rxaviers, I didnt follow you :(
[08:28:43] <scott_gonzalez> You didn't follow yourself?
[08:29:12] <rxaviers> I think that using AMD, I will use each widget's constructor more often than I used before. Using $().widget(options) is a great API
[08:29:26] <rxaviers> But, I wasn't expecting <Widget>(options, element).
[08:29:36] <rxaviers> I would guess its API was Widget(element, options)
[08:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> This is the same API as dojo.
[08:31:14] <rxaviers> Or Widget(options) (if default element is "input" for example)
[08:31:42] <scott_gonzalez> Widgets don't have to be DOM-based.
[08:31:53] <scott_gonzalez> And even if they are, they might be templated.
[08:32:33] <rxaviers> Is the majory DOM-based?
[08:32:39] <rxaviers> majority*
[08:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but the majority of users also use the jQuery API, not the object API.
[08:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> Also, AMD gets ugly or breaks down for extensions.
[08:34:07] <rxaviers> I think the jQuery API very friendly. I didn't expect the object API though.
[08:34:14] <rxaviers> But, ok. I was just curious
[08:34:25] <rxaviers> Thanks for the background
[08:35:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[08:37:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[08:38:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think when you updated tests your did something to panel tests
[08:38:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/tests/unit/panel/
[08:40:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you mean?
[08:40:19] <arschmitz> does that page work for you
[08:40:23] <arschmitz> it does not for me
[08:40:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It works, but things are all over the place.
[08:40:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The neat headings with all the tests are gone.
[08:40:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you dont think thats a problem
[08:41:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, the tests complete correctly, and the elements that contain the results are still there, but I dunno why they're not showing up.
[08:42:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah they should
[08:42:19] <arschmitz> and they did prior
[08:43:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll do a bisect to see where exactly things are starting to look weird.
[08:43:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just checked 22fcdba5aa8592cfd2d61c81d04fe03fd124765d (which is the parent of the qunit fix) and they look weird there too.
[08:44:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know e0f5b27764fb8a7cf843fa49e3dbd202879bbac9 is fine
[08:47:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Doing a bisect ...
[08:48:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yikes i think its all tests
[08:48:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, it is.
[08:48:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I noticed it but I figured it was because we were out of date wrt. qunit.
[08:49:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When I updated it and it still looked like that, I figured, oh well, as long as the tests fail when we break something ...
[08:49:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the change is very recent like since i pulled master in most of my branches
[08:49:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It breaks where we start managing dependencies with bower.
[08:50:15] <_|Nix|_> d14b90ded2f3e3845f001d15047f4a4d4fad3840
[08:50:32] <_|Nix|_> I guess we might no longer be pulling qunit-related CSS, or something.
[08:51:05] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/d14b90ded2f3e3845f001d15047f4a4d4fad3840#diff-5b29e16e98627b7a15d2b34b5d154472L228
[08:51:27] <arschmitz> we apparently had modified the css directly
[08:51:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: updated the css when he switched to bower
[08:51:51] <arschmitz> and removed our hack
[08:52:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep, looks like ...
[08:52:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We could add a css file to tests/
[08:52:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and reference it from all tests ...
[08:53:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... just like we reference jQuery.testHelper.js from some of the tests.
[08:53:53] <arschmitz> yeah we will need to do something
[08:54:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll make an issue.

[08:56:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, what do you think? tests/jqm-tests.css?
[08:57:06] <arschmitz> yeah makes sense
[08:58:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright. Can do.
[08:59:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I guess we're not gonna add https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6981 (nav hash processing demo)?
[09:00:15] <arschmitz> why?
[09:00:32] <arschmitz> because i closed that issue?
[09:00:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's what I figured.
[09:01:04] <arschmitz> no im fine with a demo i was just hoping to end the thread it was going nowhere
[09:01:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... it's the most I could do for the OP.
[09:01:28] <arschmitz> yeah and he was not willing to accept that
[09:01:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you wanna break spec, the most we can do is show you how.
[09:01:56] <arschmitz> i had actually thought you had closed the issue already
[09:02:09] <arschmitz> so when i saw it was open i closed it because we are not going to add that feature
[09:02:29] <arschmitz> its been discussed to death in multiple tickets and phone calls
[09:03:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I didn't close it because I had a ton of fun writing the demo :) Our nav is actually fairly robust and flexible.
[09:04:15] * gseguin is catching up
[09:04:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The only problem is that, if you really wanna influence it, the documentation is hardly adequate. Your best bet is to trace the nav code with a debugger and hope and pray that it gives you a hook at the right point in the process.
[09:05:06] <gseguin> arschmitz: what can I do to help?
[09:05:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We might wanna write like a flowchart or something - but that's probably more trouble than it's help.
[09:05:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Neah - don't worry about it. I got it.
[09:05:31] <arschmitz> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7025
[09:05:36] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Just need to re-add a CSS hack to the unit tests, because now they're all over the place.
[09:05:46] <arschmitz> when you updated to use bower it took out a css hack we had manually put it
[09:05:50] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The page is a mess, but the tests work correctly.
[09:06:14] <gseguin> oh, I didn't even run the tests in a browser
[09:06:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... but if you wanna take the issue, then by all means.
[09:06:23] <gseguin> since they were passing
[09:06:25] <arschmitz> gseguin: probably didnt notice because its only visual and i think most of us tend to run tests from command line
[09:06:32] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[09:06:41] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: if you got a fix for it, go
[09:06:47] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, I think so.
[09:06:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK. I'll take the issue.

[11:49:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, how are we going to handle the situation where listviews items have icons? Please don't tell me we're going to do one DOM manip per item - again ...
[11:49:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: eventually yes
[11:50:06] <_|Nix|_> Aaaaw, man, we just got away from all that.
[11:50:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: pseduo elements are bad
[11:50:24] <scott_gonzalez> How the hell do you write <code>```</code> in markdown?
[11:50:28] <arschmitz> they have the worst performance possible
[11:50:54] <scott_gonzalez> Do you just have to drop to HTML and write it out like that?
[11:50:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow, really? Hmmm ... worse than DOM manip during startup?
[11:51:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: dam__ has done tests for topcoat 
[11:51:34] <arschmitz> not to mention they are the slowest of all selectors
[11:51:44] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: If you have ``` by itself on a line, then on the next line you might be able to have ``` if it's not right at the beginning of the line.
[11:52:02] <scott_gonzalez> I want it inline.
[11:52:22] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Then I think HTML might be the only way.
[11:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> As in: "You can use <code>```</code> for blocks of code."
[11:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it might.
[11:53:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, but the crucial question is still whether doing n DOM manips for n list items is faster than doing n :after selectors ...
[11:53:17] <scott_gonzalez> I tried a few different things and couldn't get it to work without using HTML.
[11:53:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes dam__ did tests on it for topcoat because we asked him to in austin
[11:54:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's a surprising result.
[11:54:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also remember that now your doing dom manip on every reflow
[11:54:32] <arschmitz> when using :after
[11:54:48] <arschmitz> its not js dom manip but its happening under the hood just the same
[11:54:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, man! You are?
[11:55:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats what iv been lead to believe 
[11:55:22] <uGoMobi> but the difference will be that it will be possible to add the spans in the markup
[11:55:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because your css is now modifiying your dom
[11:55:34] <uGoMobi> so they don't have to be generated
[11:55:52] <_|Nix|_> I can't believe that. WTF?! You would think that it does a DOM manip if you change the CSS of the element, because it may have to re-evaluate the :after, but if you change unrelated CSS ... bewildering.
[11:56:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im sure there is optimization
[11:56:28] <arschmitz> but either way there is dom manip
[11:56:33] <uGoMobi> I knew pseudo element selectors were slow but I wouldn't have guessed it was slower than generating all those elements
[11:56:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: your generating them either way
[11:57:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly my thoughts.
[11:57:16] <uGoMobi> yeah, makes sense
[11:57:26] <arschmitz> either from css or js they are still being generated they are not in your markup
[11:57:40] <_|Nix|_> Well, alright. Back to spans it is. I mean, at least we're only doing one span.
[11:57:41] <tj_vantoll1> scott_gonzalez: Where are we at with Bower? Have we looked into exactly what we need to do to support it?
[11:57:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah true
[11:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: Not yet, but we'll support it for the 1.11 release.
[11:58:40] <arschmitz> but one is being generated from a super slow selector that needs to be parsed instead of directly by a js call
[11:58:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to just ship the source files with @version replaced.
[11:58:52] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I gotta go now ... 
[11:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> I know we've discussed this, it's probably logged somewhere public :-)
[11:59:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok later
[11:59:10] <uGoMobi> later _|Nix|_ 
[11:59:12] <tj_vantoll1> scott_gonzalez: Yeah it's fuzzy in my memory as well :P
[11:59:17] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: almost everything we do is logged somewhere public
[11:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> true
[11:59:30] <tj_vantoll1> Even this :)
[12:00:01] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi opened issue #7029: Build: Add build/report directory to .gitignore 02http://git.io/tITZnQ
[12:00:11] <tj_vantoll1> scott_gonzalez: I can dig into Bower assuming no one else is.
[12:00:43] <tj_vantoll1> Is jQuery Mobile doing anything with Bower?
[12:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: Well, I can tell you what my plans are :-)
[12:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to generate bower.json from package.json during the release.
[12:01:21] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll1: yes
[12:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> But we'll have a bower.json that lives in the repo all the time because we'll be using it for our client-side dependencies.
[12:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> Like QUnit.
[12:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> I actually explained this recently in a core PR.
[12:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> Let me find it.
[12:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> This is kinda noisy cuz the guy was being kind of a jerk, but just read my comments :-P https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1492
[12:04:42] <tj_vantoll1> arschmitz: Do you generate your bower.json or is it manually managed?
[12:06:50] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll1: we have one we manage manually for our own dependencies
[12:07:27] <arschmitz> and we dont have another one yet we just added that one recently
[12:07:50] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll1: previously i think bower was just using our package.json
[12:16:06] <tj_vantoll1> scott_gonzalez: So for our purposes you're thinking that, as part of our build or release, we'd generate a bower.json from our package.json?
[12:25:25] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Is there a saving when an iframe is generated (as in the mobile tabs page) rather than being hardcoded and with a source in a separate file?
[12:25:34] <agcolom> in terms of performance
[12:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: Well, we'll end up with bower.json already in the repo for our dependencies, but I think everything that's not needed for our dependency management should be added based on package.json during the release.
[12:27:49] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I think you're asking about two different things.
[12:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> An iframe with a source pointing to an external file.
[12:28:12] <agcolom> yes
[12:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> And an iframe with contents populated via script.
[12:28:22] <agcolom> yes
[12:28:45] <scott_gonzalez> You'd need to profile it.
[12:28:54] <scott_gonzalez> But one is network overhead while the other doesn't.
[12:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> s/is/has/
[12:29:35] <agcolom> yes, so I guess if you have a few of those on a page, that makes a difference...?
[12:29:57] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know. You'd have to profile it.
[12:30:05] <scott_gonzalez> They're not equivalent operations.
[12:30:14] <tj_vantoll1> scott_gonzalez: Ok that makes sense. I can look into creating a bower.json with just our dependencies.
[12:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> One is parsing and generating DOM while one is just network.
[12:30:49] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9507
[12:31:15] <scott_gonzalez> Same for http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9465
[12:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> Since we want that to go live with AMD.
[12:31:23] <agcolom> yes, that's why I was asking in case there was a well known answer. So I'll try and see the difference using chrome dev tools for example?
[12:31:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, though you'll need to check cache and uncached response times.
[12:31:55] <agcolom> sure.
[12:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> And that's going to vary for users.
[12:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> The joy of network performance testing.
[12:32:28] <agcolom> And both would have to be on my local setup so that at least is equivalent for both?
[12:33:09] <arschmitz> agcolom: no because you have essentially no network overhead on your local setup
[12:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the network overhead can be controlled locally.
[12:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> You can use the Network Link Conditioner in OS X.
[12:34:10] <arschmitz> yeah true
[12:35:38] <agcolom> right, thanks... I'll try tomorrow or this weekend...

[13:55:20] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I was trying to build the demos local but "grunt zip" doesn't work anymore
[13:55:38] <uGoMobi> gseguin: did we change something?
[14:03:14] <uGoMobi> gseguin|away: if I just run "grunt" the zip file is created
[14:06:03] <gseguin|away> will look
[14:06:21] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I moved the reports to _build
[14:06:33] <gseguin> and will add _build to .gitignore
[14:06:54] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi opened issue #7032: Build: jQuery core missing in the Demos JS folder 02http://git.io/q1YLKw
[14:07:03] <gseguin> I would rather have one place in the root that contains build crufts and that gets ignored by git
[14:07:08] <gseguin> what do you think?
[14:08:11] <uGoMobi> gseguin: not sure, because the reports don't have anything to do with build
[14:09:40] <gseguin> so want it to be _tests?
[14:09:56] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I know see we ignore build/test-results/ as well
[14:10:02] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah that would make more sense
[14:10:27] <gseguin> do we output anything in test-results?
[14:10:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin: the comment says it's for PhantomJS output
[14:11:02] <gseguin> hmm...
[14:11:26] <gseguin> oh I know it's something we use to use on Jenkins
[14:11:31] <gseguin> I should clean that up
[14:11:36] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I am favor centralizing output so we can just ignore one folder
[14:11:44] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[14:11:52] <gseguin> unless TravisCI has plans to support xUnit reports
[14:12:04] <gseguin> but then we'll just have to re-add it

[14:31:42] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I don't think there ever was a "zip" task
[14:31:58] <uGoMobi> gseguin: accoring to our README.md there is/was
[14:32:09] <gseguin> hmm
[14:32:29] <gseguin> maybe the README.md is wrong
[14:32:42] <gseguin> you get the zip file when you create the distributables
[14:32:45] <uGoMobi> creating the zip works if you run grunt so it's not a big problem
[14:33:08] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah, let's update the readme
[14:33:36] <uGoMobi> I am not sure it worked before
[14:33:44] <gseguin> me neither
[14:34:04] <gseguin> because you can't build the zip file until you've done a complete build
[14:35:53] <gseguin> uGoMobi: wanna take care of the readme or do you want me to?
[14:36:56] <uGoMobi> actually I would like you and arschmitz to go over the whole readme to see if it's still up to date
[14:37:08] <uGoMobi> unless that has already been done recently
[14:38:16] <gseguin> I did small updates to it after 1.4 but did not review it completely
[14:39:01] <uGoMobi> gseguin: would be great if you can go over it when you remove "grunt zip" to see if the rest is still correct
[14:39:15] <gseguin> Want a PR?
[14:39:28] <gseguin> will do
[14:39:32] <uGoMobi> yeah
