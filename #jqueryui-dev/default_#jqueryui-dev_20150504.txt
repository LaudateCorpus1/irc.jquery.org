[04:34:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:43:29] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[05:46:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:46:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Do you think we could land autoinit?
[05:47:55] <gabriel_schulhof> I ask, because it touches page, and I was thinking that maybe there's a way of re-implementing the dialog widget as an extension of the, well, dialog extension. After all, the only difference is the presence of the close() method and of the data-role="dialog" attribute on the element, which nav treats specially.
[05:48:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: sure there were a couple small things i wanted to fix up aside from that its ready
[05:48:37] <arschmitz> ill work on that today
[05:48:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. The demo tests are failing for some reason.
[05:48:57] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Please, that'd be super-awesome!
[05:48:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok ill check those too
[05:50:31] <gabriel_schulhof> On that cheery note, I'll check back in in about six, seven hours (read: when my daughter's gone to bed :) ), and have a look at whether I can squeeze the dialog out without breaking anything.
[05:50:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: sounds good
[06:31:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Holy shitsu! It can't be that simple! https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/a88a897885df25907111
[06:32:27] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That results in a page styled as a dialog + the dialog special nav handling!
[06:33:06] <gabriel_schulhof> All I need now is the close() method ...
[06:33:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Actually, I don't, because the only thing that calls it is custom selectmenu, so I can just change that to go back.
[06:35:00] <arschmitz> what you really need is updated nav
[06:35:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but we've agreed that that has to stay for 1.5.
[06:35:34] <arschmitz> yup
[06:35:46] <gabriel_schulhof> At least we can get rid of the widget file. So, that's kinda clean, but kinda not because of nav.
[06:35:53] <arschmitz> unless we had some other way to make selectmenu continue to work 
[06:36:35] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm not gonna go there now. I'm just happy I can remove the dialog widget, because it was totally unnecessary.
[06:36:44] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:36:55] <arschmitz> i was not suggesting you should do that
[06:37:02] <arschmitz> id rather not try to add anything else to 1.5
[06:37:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, believe me, I've tried to do that on a previous iteration o the page classes option implementation. It's ... shall we say, ... tangled.

[08:24:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I'll be ... implementing the dialog widget as an extension of page has revealed that we've actually slashed a useful feature of the dialog: The fact that, if you click on the close button twice, the second click is ignored.
[14:24:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so apparently you can completely remove degradeInputs and all the tests for it still pass :-/
