[03:36:11] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] README: remove dependency on pygmentize now that we're on grunt-jquery-content 0.3 - Richard D. Worth
[05:36:45] <jzaefferer> gnarf: any idea why http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.6.x%20core/36/ ran all jquery versions, not just 1.6?
[07:31:32] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - git core build #44: FAILURE in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/44/

[07:59:01] <doesallmagic> Scott González: Release: Update TODOs related to publishing generated files.

[08:52:31] <scott_gonzalez> I REALLY hate the fact that the GitHub v3 API doesn't support tokens for authentication.
[09:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[09:40:38] <scott_gonzalez> With GitHub switching to OS X keychains, I can't expect people to have github.user set in their git config anymore.
[09:53:44] <kborchers> thanks GitHub!
[10:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like you should be able to upload a file directly to GitHub and they should handle passing it off to s3.
[10:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> Having a two step upload process is ridiculous.

[14:18:50] <gnarf> kborchers: you around?
[14:19:00] <gnarf> position fail in ff 14: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/110440
[14:19:16] <kborchers> oh come on!
[14:19:38] <kborchers> FF and position has been really annoying
[14:21:01] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #610: STILL FAILING in 21 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/610/
[14:22:18] <gnarf> kborchers: at least our suite looks better in FF14 than core: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/404
[14:22:20] <kborchers> gnarf: that passes when you run it manually … FF just throws weird fractional positions occasionally via Browserstack i think
[14:22:50] <kborchers> ouch
[14:23:31] <gnarf> kborchers: hrm
[14:23:41] <gnarf> kborchers: we need to figure out why/when that happens and squash it
[14:24:04] <gnarf> kborchers: after a rerun - its green
[14:24:10] <kborchers> yep
[14:24:48] <kborchers> gnarf: that's why i haven't tracked it down. it seems very random so very hard to pinpoint why/when it happens
[14:25:04] <kborchers> i have never seen it 2 times in a row
