[05:24:54] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez The cmd + L and ctrl + enter fixes for jsFiddle are both live now.
[05:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> So awesome.
[05:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> Also awesome, is that I just learned about .mailmap for git shortlog.
[05:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> Building one for UI right now.
[05:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> The varying names/email addressed in our history have always bothered me.
[05:26:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's especially annoying when I'm trying to figure out stats for presentations.
[05:28:49] <tj_vantoll> Interesting, didn't know that existed.
[05:31:51] <tj_vantoll> Also I have no idea what the OP is talking about in #9054 (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9054).
[05:32:16] <scott_gonzalez> Me neither.
[05:33:30] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have OS X 10.8.2.
[05:33:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'm on 10.7.5.
[05:34:08] <scott_gonzalez> Funny that he has a newer OS version, but an older Safari version. I'm on 6.0.2.
[05:34:32] <tj_vantoll> I have 10.8.2, but I also have 6.0.2 for Safari.
[05:34:51] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well, if you can't reproduce with 10.8.2, the only thing I can think of is to ask what timezone setting he has.

[05:40:21] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: hey, .mailmap looks useful
[05:50:49] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yeah, I just replied to that PR.
[05:50:57] <scott_gonzalez> That's why it took me 10 minutes to respond to you :-P
[05:51:13] <DaveMethvin> shoulda figured that git would have something to address the issue
[05:51:21] <DaveMethvin> git has EVERYTHING
[05:51:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, at some point I'll probably map all the UI names to the CLAdata.
[05:51:42] <scott_gonzalez> But for now, top contributors is really useful on its own.

[05:54:24] <doesallmagic> Scott Gonz√°lez: Added .mailmap for top contributors.
[05:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> Damnit, I keep getting dialog down to 0 bugs, but people keep filing tickets :-P
[05:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> The speed at which dark green can morph into light green always gets to me ;-) http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/29
[05:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: That .scrollParent() bug that came in is like a kick the face.
[05:59:40] <tj_vantoll> Why's that?
[05:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> I can't count the number of times I've looked at that function, cringed, started to rewrite it, and then stopped because I didn't want to take the time to test all the various situations in all the IE versions.
[06:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it's time to actually fix it.
[06:00:54] <tj_vantoll> I can imagine.  What all uses it in UI?
[06:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> draggable and sortable
[06:01:47] <tj_vantoll> Ugh, 74 matches.  Makes sense though.
[06:02:19] <tj_vantoll> Quite possibly the cause of existing draggable/sortable bugs.
[06:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, yeah, 74 matches for "scrollParent" but only 2 calls to the actual function.
[06:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> The other matches are just references to the stored result.
[06:03:00] <tj_vantoll> Heh, yeah whoops.
[06:03:06] <tj_vantoll> scrollParent( => 2 matches
[06:07:28] <scott_gonzalez> Figures, no branch or stash for any of my .scrollParent() rewrites.
[06:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> No gist either.

[06:48:20] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez There's a bug for the step buttons not zooming in Chrome.  It's been out there for awhile though.

[09:43:51] <b-ot> gnarf: Pull request #99 by gnarf37 (1m 22s): Moving cache to memory
[09:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Do we use zlib in download builder at all?
[09:54:35] <rxaviers> to build the package
[09:54:51] <scott_gonzalez> node 0.8.19 reduces memory consumption of zlib.
[09:55:05] <scott_gonzalez> But it doesn't seem like we've had any memory issues from that.
[09:55:18] <scott_gonzalez> So doesn't seem important to update right away.
[09:55:35] <gnarf> rxaviers: um, why is the test stalling, any thoughts?
[09:55:49] <rxaviers> anything to do with left setInterval stuff?
[09:56:05] <rxaviers> just guessing, I didnt really look into it yet
[09:56:27] <gnarf> maybe?
[09:56:31] <gnarf> because the timeout is still there
[09:56:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ?
[09:56:46] <scott_gonzalez> Just opened the PR.
[09:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: +new Date() => Date.now() :-)
[09:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> Just FYI
[09:57:55] <scott_gonzalez> The joy of developing for a single, up-to-date VM.
[09:58:08] <rxaviers> gnarf, yeap, I've removed the timeouts and it just exited normally
[09:58:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: any thought on the timeout issue?
[09:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> Still reading.
[09:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so this is because you don't have a way to kill the timeout loop.
[09:59:30] <gnarf> yeah
[09:59:33] <scott_gonzalez> You need to expose something to kill it.
[09:59:36] <gnarf> okay
[09:59:40] <gnarf> and where to i do that from?
[10:00:10] <scott_gonzalez> You could actually modify how this works and make the cache expiration optional.
[10:00:28] <gnarf> listening...
[10:00:48] <gnarf> I was just gonna do Image.shutdown = f(){ clearTimeout....
[10:00:51] <scott_gonzalez> have something like Image.setCacheDuration()
[10:01:00] <scott_gonzalez> And when you call it, it does the first timeout.
[10:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> Fair warning: I haven't looked at all the code, so that may be tricky to implement where you don't trigger that in tests.
[10:02:07] <gnarf> its actually not that bad to implement
[10:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> The quickest thing would be Image.stopCache() which just does a clearTimeout().
[10:04:15] <gnarf> yeah
[10:04:54] <rxaviers> gnarf, that's all from me. cool
[10:06:05] <gnarf> hrm
[10:06:45] <rxaviers> I would make cachnig optional and activate that on ./server.js gnarf. That's where I activate ./lib/builder caches too
[10:07:04] <rxaviers> So, --no-cache also works :)
[10:07:17] <rxaviers> --nocache actually
[10:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers gnarf: https://twitter.com/scullytr/status/299213909645205504
[10:08:26] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: @scullytr: @jqueryui it seems http://t.co/zmZz5v3v is having issues. I can't download my theme!
[10:08:39] <rxaviers> will check
[10:11:31] <rxaviers> gnarf, you rm cache files about now?
[10:11:40] <rxaviers> we're having a lot of timeouts on server
[10:12:04] <rxaviers> image generation works steady when cache is ready. Creating it is a pain
[10:12:05] <rxaviers> :/
[10:12:14] <gnarf> so um
[10:12:25] <gnarf> yeah
[10:12:28] <gnarf> on it
[10:12:29] <gnarf> :)
[10:13:19] <rxaviers> gnarf, scott_gonzalez, guys, that's one really pros for keeping cache on disk. Everytime we restart builder, we dont need the pain to re-create it
[10:13:50] <rxaviers> it badly works while creating it
[10:15:20] <gnarf> just pushed the cache fix, doesn't stall on npm test anymore
[10:15:29] <gnarf> last peek before i merge anyone?
[10:21:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: sorry for missing the meeting. in meetings all week for work (including now)
[10:28:16] <rxaviers> gnarf, scott_gonzalez, current issue questions image memory caching... :/
[10:37:41] <gnarf> rxaviers: ?
[10:37:47] <rxaviers> yep
[10:37:58] <gnarf> rxaviers: what was the issue?
[10:38:03] <gnarf> slowness at the startup?
[10:38:16] <rxaviers> people are complaining they are getting time out errors
[10:38:24] <rxaviers> errors log are crazy giving time out
[10:38:39] <rxaviers> While image caches are not built, server does not respond in time
[10:38:49] <gnarf> did we merge it in already?
[10:38:58] <gnarf> or are you saying that it will create problems?
[10:38:59] <rxaviers> pardom?
[10:39:14] <rxaviers> nope, the one you are working is not merged
[10:39:33] <rxaviers> it has to do the fact you deleted the cache, so running DB needed to recreate it
[10:39:41] <rxaviers> sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/download.jqueryui.com.error.log
[10:40:10] <rxaviers> :(
[10:40:31] <rxaviers> today is a high traffic day (we have lower traffic on weekends)
[10:40:48] <rxaviers> brb
[10:41:28] <gnarf> so the images can't be created in time?
[10:41:43] <gnarf> in 60 seconds?
[10:41:57] <gnarf> because of the cache...
[10:42:17] <gnarf> er queue
[10:42:33] <gnarf> too many incoming requests or something?
[10:46:17] <gnarf> Is it possible to start the response headers, then send content-length / data last?
[10:46:27] <gnarf> so we can be like "we're working on this....... here it is"
[10:46:32] <gnarf> maybe that will stop the timeout?
[10:53:15] <gnarf> we should try deploying this branch I think
[10:53:20] <gnarf> I'm gonna merge it into master

[10:57:16] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: Cache images in memory instead of disk - Closes gh-99
[10:57:28] <gnarf> github hooks seem f'ed up again today
[11:08:15] <gnarf> memory usage seems sane
[11:08:20] <gnarf> no 502's in the error log
[11:08:32] <gnarf> still waiting to hear a report on the first cache cleanup
[11:12:16] <rxaviers> gnarf, the request timeouts was due to image generation being queue and not delivered I guess yeap.
[11:12:35] <gnarf> rxaviers: all i saw were refused cause it crashed
[11:12:43] <gnarf> but
[11:12:48] <gnarf> tailing logs now
[11:12:50] <gnarf> nothing showing up
[11:13:03] <rxaviers> 2013/02/06 10:40:06 [error] 20370#0: *10534350 upstream timed out (110: Connection timed out) while reading response header from upstream, client: 69.70.115.122, server: download.jqueryui.com, request: "GET /themeroller/images/ui-icons_d5d5d5_256x240.png HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:3000/themeroller/images/ui-icons_d5d5d5_256x240.png", host: "download.jqueryui.com", referrer: "http://www.hockeymineurwaterloo.com/fr/index.html"
[11:13:10] <rxaviers> sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/download.jqueryui.com.error.log
[11:15:19] <rxaviers> It would be good to write some bench tests
[11:15:34] <rxaviers> like taking a log of image filenames for texture and icons and measure that creation
[11:15:44] <rxaviers> lot*
[11:17:18] <gnarf> rxaviers: since i restarted on the memory cache branch, i haven't seen any errors in that log
[11:18:59] <rxaviers> ah! really
[11:19:01] <rxaviers> that's good to know
[11:19:19] <rxaviers> so the issue might have with speed writing the file into disk..
[11:21:03] <rxaviers> cool, awesome than
[11:22:06] <rxaviers> then*
[11:29:28] <gnarf> yeah, memory impact is like non-existant here
[11:33:47] <gnarf> load is rather minimal still
[11:37:23] <gnarf> somewhere around 30 mintues we should see our first cache clean
[11:37:29] <gnarf> look at some numbers
[12:07:36] <gnarf> Cache Cleanup: { cache: 2413, deleted: 0 }
[12:07:55] <gnarf> makes sense that none were deleted then
[12:08:03] <gnarf> but first hour had 2413 images cached
[13:02:53] <gnarf> Cache Cleanup: { cache: 3760, deleted: 1523 }
[13:03:00] <gnarf> still no errors in error log
