[02:28:50] <jez> Hi guys, what do you think about my suggestion here: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/add-thumb-up-thumb-down-icons-to-default-theme
[02:29:08] <jez> several times now I've found myself wanting thumb up / thumb down icons, and they'd be quite easy to add

[05:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> I dunno.

[07:38:44] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ?

[07:39:09] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't even write any code.
[07:39:47] <mikesherov> Ha, awesome
[07:39:57] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, hey scott
[07:39:59] <mikesherov> That was all just movement?
[07:40:04] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> Hey rxaviers.
[07:40:18] <rxaviers> So far, we are only using key-value pairs. Thats right
[07:40:30] <mikesherov> Brb
[07:41:25] <rxaviers> Do you think I should right those functions instead of using any external lib? Although, using less code. I still think it's weird not having something like that out there I can use
[07:41:29] <rxaviers> write*
[07:41:30] <rxaviers> ops
[07:42:10] <rxaviers> To serialize (encode), I even could use jquery's $.param
[07:42:43] <scott_gonzalez> I just think that node's full solution is overkill.
[07:42:48] <rxaviers> but, we would need to write our deserialize
[07:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> It's like 5 lines of code to write a proper encoder.
[07:44:57] <scott_gonzalez> What do we need to deserialize? The URL on first load?
[07:47:26] <rxaviers> basically, yes. But, it also deserializes in one more place. The download parameters are not exactly like the themeroller parameters. So, in this parameter-mapping, I deserialize and serialize themeParams
[07:48:04] <rxaviers> to appropriately merge them with new vars like version
[07:49:21] <scott_gonzalez> Isn't this enough? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/qunit/qunit.js#L706
[07:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, that's a lot of QUnit specific code, but the decoding in there is like 5 lines.
[07:49:56] <rxaviers> checking..

[07:58:07] <rxaviers> At some point, when we need to use something else than a 1-depth key-value pairs, it won't work anymore. But, yeap I think for our current use it will work.

[08:41:22] <rxaviers> I kept the same "api", using the simpler decoder. Plus using $.param for encoder
[08:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> Do you ever call QueryString.(un)escape outside of the module itself?
[08:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: ^
[08:48:18] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, nope
[08:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm commenting on the commit.
[08:48:30] <rxaviers> wanna lock that?
[08:48:55] <rxaviers> avoid putting that in the public interface?
[08:49:00] <rxaviers> ok
[08:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone else have broken icons on GitHub using Chrome?
[08:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> I get this warning: Resource interpreted as Font but transferred with MIME type image/svg+xml: "https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/assets/octicons/octicons-regular-webfont-4cfac6c47d082f5408b0fb7f449e872135f44d08.svg".
[08:52:54] <scott_gonzalez> And all of the icons just show up as boxes.
[08:52:58] <scott_gonzalez> Works fine in Firefox.
[09:00:10] <rxaviers> I use firefox. But, testing it in Chrome now it also seems fine
[09:00:21] <rxaviers> Any icon in specific?
[09:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> All the icons.
[09:01:43] <rxaviers> it's opening just fine here in chrome too

[09:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on.

[09:21:42] <agcolom> great, I'll ping you when I'm back...
[09:24:42] <rxaviers> people, forgive me for the other force push to this branch. But, better clean it up before merging to master
[09:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer gnarf mikesherov _zoggy_ petersendidit kborchers: Any objection to adjusting the dialog styling so that the bottom-right resize handler isn't visible?
[09:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> My plan is to shift it down so that it extends outside of the dialog, like all the other resize handlers.
[09:44:58] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be 5px outside, 7px inside, but the icon won't be visible at all.
[09:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> I did some quick testing and noticed that <textarea> on Chrome only shows the resize icon when the content is scollable :-P
[09:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> As soon as the content has scroll, the icon disappears.
[09:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't find anything else to compare to.

[09:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> Does WordPress have any dialogs with really long titles?
[09:49:10] <koopersmith> scott_gonzalez: How would you define "really long"?
[09:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> Long enough to fall onto multiple lines.

[09:59:19] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I'm back... is this a good time for you?
[09:59:24] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[10:00:45] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that resize handle stuff sounds sane to me
[10:00:57] <agcolom> I am not sure I understand what the problem is (sorry if I am being not very clever ;-) )
[10:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> Imagine I want to give you a link to the enable method.
[10:01:58] <agcolom> ok, so only in that case...
[10:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, which is a very common case.
[10:02:23] <agcolom> ok, thanks, now I get it ;-)
[10:02:50] <agcolom> That's a shame, because I liked the solution ;-)
[10:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> koopersmith: I just want to make sure that's not going to cause any problems for WordPress. I doubt it will.
[10:04:14] <koopersmith> scott_gonzalez: Doubtful. Nothing in core, at least.

[10:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> koopersmith: No problem, one more thing I'd like to check with you...
[10:05:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking about changing the styling of the bottom right resize handle on the dialog so that it's not visible.
[10:05:48] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: because options are under the options tab, methods under the methods tab, etc... can we cheat somehow and guess which tab it is by reading the URL?
[10:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> I want to shrink it from 14x14 to 12x12 and move it 5px outside of the dialog (to match the positining of all other resize handles, which are also invisible)
[10:06:21] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: just updated https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/856 - I can merge, too
[10:06:36] <koopersmith> scott_gonzalez: Seems reasonable.
[10:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[10:07:04] <koopersmith> We use really minimal styling on all of our UI widgets, so it shouldn't affect us much either way. :)
[10:08:18] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Go ahead and land that. I'm going to make the resizable change which will close another ticket :-)

[10:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Just force it to be hidden prior to .dialog() in the tests?
[10:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> I think it makes sense for dialogs to always be hidden on destroy.
[10:37:14] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: as long as we close more than we open, I don't care how many get opened
[10:38:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: okay, will do that. So inline display:none should stay, and we don't bother removing that. The reporter wasn't complaining about that part.

[11:50:43] <_zoggy_> i personally like the dialog resize handler.. its very useful for touch ui (as you cant hover over a mouse to 'figure out' if you can resize)
[11:50:57] <_zoggy_> so to me.. its a form of accessibilty to the user so they know they can resize
[11:51:10] <_zoggy_> i hate hate hate when i run across something that can resize and theres no handler
[11:51:37] <_zoggy_> but some invisible block or narrow spot you have to hit.. and its never big enough (i assume its because i run at a res larger than they deved for)
[11:51:54] <_zoggy_> at least with a static handler it makes it visible touch target and gives a visual clue

[16:22:03] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06master 141e8baf5 15J√∂rn Zaefferer: Dialog: Remove the instance-storing for the overlay, just create one whenever it is needed. Heavily simplifies the code, while the memorly leak should be hardly an issue anymore, since fixed positioning restricts the overlay size to the window dimensions. Fixes #6058 - Dialog overlays are not properly reused when multiple instances of a Dialog exist.

[16:58:35] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you there?
[16:58:45] <mikesherov> the getElementStyles thing, you're right
[16:59:05] <mikesherov> jzaefferer's change only now checks inline styles, and not computed styles, which is what we want
[16:59:08] <mikesherov> hi petro
[17:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I'm here.
[17:00:29] <scott_gonzalez> Right, that's what I thought.
[17:00:41] <mikesherov> it's bogus, and it led to two bogus commits
[17:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> REVERT REVERT REVERT
[17:01:50] <mikesherov> and we should just figure out what's wrong with accordion, rather than throw the whole thing out completely
[17:02:01] <mikesherov> ha
[17:02:01] <mikesherov> yeah
[17:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I had it commented out because I didn't have the time to dig in when I wrote the test.
[17:02:21] <mikesherov> it's actually a pretty cool check
[17:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it shows things that are hard to spot manually.
[17:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> We need to make the QUnit.equiv() output better.
[17:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> The diffs for deep objects are insane.
[17:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> If domEqual() fails it's near impossible to parse.

[17:04:17] <doesallmagic> joern.zaefferer: Tabs: Remove display property on hidden panels instead of setting display:block. Surfaced by domEqual now checking for style property (see d687a1b).
[17:04:45] <mikesherov> sure, but we can only do that if the code exists :-)
[17:06:57] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[17:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll tackle that stuff tomorrow (the reverts, enabling the test, improving QUnit.equiv()) if it's not done when I wake up.
[17:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna let my brain rest. Still mentally and physically exhuasted from this move.
[17:08:28] <scott_gonzalez> And there's still so much to unpack.
[17:09:38] <mikesherov> yeah, unpack!
[17:09:45] <mikesherov> that'll put your mind at ease
[17:16:44] <_zoggy_> jzaefferer, the tiny target of the border to hit with the mouse
[17:16:50] <_zoggy_> and you really dont know you can resize it
[17:24:32] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: It's a 12px target.
[17:24:42] <scott_gonzalez> The size barely changed.
[17:31:04] <_zoggy_> hmm dunno i miss the resize image :(
[17:37:27] <scott_gonzalez> The complaint was that when the contents are scrollable, the resize handle covered the scrollbar.

[18:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> Took a while, but I'm starting to get the hang of this CAD stuff: http://cl.ly/image/443y471l2e3O
[18:19:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hey, just replied to one of your line comments. Am I just tired and dumb right now?
[18:20:42] <scott_gonzalez> The function is currently written as:
[18:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> if ( continueRecursing ) { doMainRecursion; } else { terminate; }
[18:21:28] <scott_gonzalez> Generally recursive loops are written as:
[18:21:41] <scott_gonzalez> if ( terminalCondition ) { terminate } else { doMainRecursion; }
[18:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> Which let's you not have the actual `else` since you'd return in your terminal condition.
[18:22:15] <kborchers> gotcha, thanks
[18:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> BUT
[18:22:25] <mikesherov> fun
[18:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> Then I said this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/548a6ce7f927f327e7db261d343caba9b889409d#commitcomment-2232035
[18:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> Which gets rid of the terminal action all together.
[18:22:53] <kborchers> right, which i have done
[18:23:00] <kborchers> maybe that's why i am confused
[18:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> Could be.
[18:23:27] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you might find this interesting: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-simulate/commit/a57a9c311b2a3fb220dafd09c2da38efa7714d04
[18:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> Using the complete callback simplifies the recursive part.
[18:24:09] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: interesting
[18:25:00] <mikesherov> looks like oldIE event.button is essentially what DOM3 event.buttons is
[18:25:15] <mikesherov> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/MouseEvent
[18:28:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/4199953 ?
[18:30:00] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: line 23: if ( value < 99 ) { setTimeout( progress, 100 ); }
[18:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> No need for the terminal since it doesn't do anything.
[18:30:20] <scott_gonzalez> And we don't need to worry about indentation here.
[18:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> Which would be the only other reason to do the early return (so we can avoid indenting inside else)
[18:30:59] <kborchers> wow ‚Ä¶ i need to either go to bed or start drinking more ‚Ä¶ probably voting for drinking more :) thanks
[18:31:00] <scott_gonzalez> line 16 could be .progressbar( "value" ) || 0
[18:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> I've got some rum and ginger ale right next to me :-)
