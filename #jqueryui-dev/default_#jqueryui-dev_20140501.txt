[07:23:44] <Agil> Hello, does anyone know if there is a way around https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/193
[07:23:57] <Agil> I've been trying to download my theme for 6 days, but sadly it still doesn't work =/
[07:26:03] <arschmitz> Agil: that is a new issue it has not happened for 6 days
[07:26:22] <arschmitz> its from a commit just yesterday
[07:27:03] <Agil> https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/189
[07:27:20] <Agil> That was posted an hour before I noticed it
[07:27:23] <arschmitz> Agil: thats a different problem
[07:27:37] <arschmitz> thats a 502 gate way not a 500 server error
[07:27:50] <Agil> I know that ;)
[07:28:04] <arschmitz> and was only happening to some people the 500 is everyone
[07:28:17] <Agil> Still can't download anything though. But it's a known issue, all I wanted to know :)
[07:28:34] <Agil> Wish I could fix it myself ;p
[07:28:34] <arschmitz> yes i personally cant replicate the 502
[07:28:50] <arschmitz> but your the second person to report it
[07:28:55] <Agil> I can't either anymore, it's a 500 now.
[07:29:18] <arschmitz> yes but that is unrelated and will be fixed shortly
[07:29:32] <Agil> Alright, awesome :)
[07:30:10] <arschmitz> if you still get the 502 error after https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/193 is fixed please post on 
[07:30:18] <arschmitz> Agil: https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/189
[07:30:27] <Agil> I will, no problem

[10:01:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7266 and http://jsbin.com/fovacezo/3 ... it looks like the icon-only buttons in the footer are not mini by default.
[10:01:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... whereas the text-button is mini.
[10:02:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is no mini version of icon-only buttons
[10:02:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's one-size-fits-all
[10:03:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.core.css#L265
[10:04:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there we override the mini font-size and the height and width are based on that (em values)
[10:06:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but now I opened the JS Bin I see that causes an issue with controlgroups (thought you were talking about standalone icon-only buttons)
[10:06:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, and I just updated the controlgroup in the contents and mini works fine.
[10:07:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looks like we need an override in the controlgroup CSS
[10:07:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I'll take this ticket
[10:07:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think the problem is that this selector: .ui-mini.ui-btn-icon-notext, .ui-mini .ui-btn-icon-notext, .ui-header .ui-btn-icon-notext, .ui-footer .ui-btn-icon-notext { has higher priority than .ui-header .ui-btn, .ui-footer .ui-btn {
[10:08:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well, it should for standalone icon-only buttons, just not for ones inside controlgroups
[10:09:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
[10:09:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Cool! Ticket's all yours :)
[10:10:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thing is, it works inside controlgroups, just not when those controlgroups are inside a footer.
[10:10:03] <uGoMobi> thanks :)
[10:10:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[10:10:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... probably because inside a footer, you don't have to say data-mini="true"
[10:10:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... on the controlgroup, but you still have to get that effect.
[10:12:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think about writing a css test for this? Create two controlgroups, just like in http://jsbin.com/fovacezo/3/ and then make sure that, for all members of one controlgroup, its height is the same as the height of the other members?
[10:13:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'd love to write the test once you write the fix *grin*
[10:13:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure, cool :)

[12:53:17] <sheppard> hi all
[12:53:29] <sheppard> i'm going to start upgrading wq.app's jQM version in a few weeks - it's still on 1.3.2
[12:53:48] <sheppard> should i skip 1.4.2 and go straight to master?
[12:54:11] <sheppard> what i'm really asking is how far out (roughly) is 1.5?
[12:54:18] <sheppard> or is it too early to say
[13:03:23] <_|Nix|_> sheppard: Pretty far, I'd say ... uGoMobi?
[13:03:45] <_|Nix|_> sheppard: So far in master we only have post-1.4.2 fixes.
[13:04:21] <uGoMobi> yeah, I don't expect 1.5 final before July
[13:05:28] <sheppard> ok, i'll keep that in mind, thanks
[13:05:42] <sheppard> are there likely to be any major HTML/CSS changes?
[13:05:52] <sheppard> i.e. on the scale of 1.3 -> 1.4
[13:06:10] <uGoMobi> sheppard: no
[13:06:40] <uGoMobi> sheppard: http://jquerymobile.com/roadmap/
[13:07:30] <arschmitz> sheppard: if you use page events 1.4.3 will have some big changes kinda
[13:08:15] <sheppard> i saw things were moving toward the container level
[13:08:25] <arschmitz> yes
[13:08:32] <arschmitz> just a sec ill post the issue with the changes
[13:09:18] <arschmitz> sheppard: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7283
[13:10:56] <sheppard> hmm, looks like i'll need to read up on that issue, thanks
[13:10:59] <sheppard> the main event i use is pagebeforechange since i'm doing a lot of jQM-router stuff
[13:11:24] <arschmitz> sheppard: you will want to switch to pagecontainerbeforechange
[13:11:30] <arschmitz> but that only exists in a branch right now
[13:11:54] <arschmitz> but will be in 1.4.3 very soon
[13:12:08] <arschmitz> its my main priority right now
[13:12:15] <sheppard> ok, good to know
[13:12:19] <sheppard> i'm not sure how active jQM-router is, might need to roll my own
[13:12:40] <sheppard> what does "support deep linking" mean in the roadmap?
[13:12:58] <arschmitz> sheppard: links to an id within a page
[13:13:25] <sheppard> like the traditional hash usage?
[13:13:31] <arschmitz> yes
[13:13:36] <sheppard> ok gotcha
[13:13:46] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gseguin created 06issue-7284 (+1 new commit): 02http://git.io/8Kr-yw

[13:13:47] <arschmitz> so how foo.html#bar will scroll to the element with id #bar when the page loads
[13:14:01] <sheppard> yeah, i've missed that at times
[13:14:06] <arschmitz> we dont support that right now but will 
[13:14:09] <arschmitz> it works in our demos
[13:14:18] <arschmitz> but its a hack i made 
[13:14:26] <arschmitz> so going to make it officially work
[13:14:43] <sheppard> that will be useful
[13:14:49] <arschmitz> sheppard: yes
[13:15:08] <arschmitz> but in 1.5 we are likely going to break many routers 
[13:15:16] <sheppard> yeah i would imagine
[13:15:31] <sheppard> i mostly use pushState URLs myself
[13:15:33] <arschmitz> sheppard: because we are going to now use the hash exactly as is
[13:15:52] <arschmitz> so if someone does #foo?bar it will look for an id foo?bar
[13:15:59] <arschmitz> which is exactly how native works
[13:16:34] <arschmitz> sheppard: there will be no more special casing for anything in the hash
[13:16:58] <arschmitz> sheppard: however there will also be a more sane way to implement a router
[13:17:03] <sheppard> i definitely like the emphasis in jQM to try to match native functionality
[13:17:11] <sheppard> sets jQM apart from others IMO
[13:17:46] <sheppard> i have this router thing going where i sometimes render pages on the client or server depending on what data i have locally
[13:17:52] <arschmitz> yes thats very much our intention we want to emulate native behavior anywhere possible
[13:18:13] <sheppard> so if the router can't handle it, i seamlessly fall back to the built-in jQM loader
[13:18:22] <arschmitz> sheppard: cool
[13:18:52] <arschmitz> sheppard: im working on nav to make it easier to control but closer to native
[13:19:02] <arschmitz> so if you want something like a router it will be easy to do
[13:19:11] <arschmitz> but otherwise it behaves exactly like native
[13:19:49] <sheppard> yeah i'll definitely be interested in that (esp. if jQM-router isn't updated)
[13:19:52] <arschmitz> history and navigation is tricky stuff though 
[13:20:16] <sheppard> most of that will be in 1.5 i assume
[13:20:36] <sheppard> yeah, it's tricky
[13:21:41] <arschmitz> sheppard: all of it
[13:21:58] <sheppard> i meant except for the bits that come before then
[13:24:12] <sheppard> saw the page events worksheet, that will be useful
[13:25:11] <arschmitz> sheppard: what i mean is none of this will be in 1.4.x it will all be 1.5
[13:25:22] <arschmitz> execpt for whats in that issue with pagecontainer events
[13:25:31] <sheppard> ok
[13:25:52] <Krinkle> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: Which thing in portland where you referring to?
[13:27:47] <sheppard> thanks everyone, i'll think more about my upgrade timing and let you know if i have other questions
[13:28:10] <arschmitz> Krinkle: we were talking about enhancing table rows
[13:28:32] <arschmitz> Krinkle: and doing it in batches with and pushing to then end of the call stack
[13:29:09] <arschmitz> based on a timer so it would never be blocking ( in a noticeable way )
[13:29:23] <Krinkle> Ah yeah, exec in batches to yield the thread every now ad then to avoid blocking the UI thread.
[13:29:34] <Krinkle> And act on a detached tree so that you still only have 1 redraw
[13:29:51] <arschmitz> Krinkle: you do something in wikipedia but a little different and were going to look at changing it with what i had suggested
[13:29:55] <Krinkle> (the latter may not be desirable depending on how much you want/need to show at once)
[13:30:24] <Krinkle> Hm.. I don't recall where we'd use that in Wikipedia. Not for a table anyway.
[13:30:28] <arschmitz> essentially to base how many operations you do at a time based on device speed rather then x number of rows
[13:30:40] <Krinkle> yeah, that makes sense
[13:30:44] <arschmitz> Krinkle: not for tables you used it for something else
[13:30:55] <arschmitz> so basicly only allow it to block for X amount of time
[13:30:59] <arschmitz> rather then for x opperations
[13:31:40] <arschmitz> Krinkle: and to handle the concern of how much needs to be shown at once to start you could implement either a min number of rows at a time
[13:31:48] <arschmitz> or a minimum inital number
[13:31:54] <arschmitz> potentially based on screen size
[13:34:26] <arschmitz> Krinkle: just the idea of batching to attempt to not block the ui thread was what you were talking about with wikipedia not tables 
[13:34:41] <arschmitz> and the idea of switching from one based on number of operations to one based on a timer
[14:52:31] <gseguin> arschmitz: when you have time, can you review: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7361
