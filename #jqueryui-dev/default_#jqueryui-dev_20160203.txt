[08:38:04] <Mr21> Hi :)
[08:38:07] <Mr21> May I ask you why jQuery-UI doesn't follow the progress of jQuery?
[08:38:25] <Mr21> If I understood weel, jqueryui-1.11.4 need at least jquery-1.6, so it's means that the lastest jqueryui version don't use any commits of jquery since 2011?
[08:57:03] <scott_gonzalez_> Mr21: Why would you think that?
[08:57:15] <scott_gonzalez_> AT LEAST is different than AT MOST
[08:59:27] <Mr21> scott_gonzalez_: Hmm I said "at least" because the last jqueryui works only with jquery-1.6+ right?
[09:00:20] <scott_gonzalez_> correct.
[09:00:25] <scott_gonzalez_> Meaning you can not use older than 1.6
[09:01:43] <scott_gonzalez_> At the time that 1.11.4 was released, it was tested against 21 different versions of jQuery.
[09:01:55] <scott_gonzalez_> 1.6.0 being the oldest of those 21 versions.
[09:03:49] <Mr21> ahhhh really? but when you are writing the code of jqueryui, do you considere all the possibility of the lastest jquery version? you are not trying to keep the old jquery dependance?
[09:10:05] <Mr21> scott_gonzalez_: Just for an example, I have made a tiny change in jquery: you aren't oblige to check the value of something to perform a .each(). So, if in your code you have something like: if(arr){$.each(arr,...)} will you update this part of code and change the dependance to jquery-1.12?
[09:10:33] <scott_gonzalez_> umm...
[09:10:47] <scott_gonzalez_> Well, that's an odd pattern in the first place.
[09:10:48] <Mr21> It's a tiny example, but I suppose since 2011, many jquery's signature has change?
[09:10:50] <scott_gonzalez_> But ignoring that.
[09:10:57] <scott_gonzalez_> No, we wouldn't use that for about three years.
[09:11:10] <scott_gonzalez_> Otherwise our support would jump from 1.6+ to 3.0+
[09:11:19] <scott_gonzalez_> And that would be absolutely terrible for our users.
[09:11:33] <Mr21> Yes, I clearly understand this.
[09:12:23] <scott_gonzalez_> If we really want a new feature, we just reimplement it and put it in a separate module.
[09:12:38] <scott_gonzalez_> For example: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery-1-7.js
[09:12:39] <Mr21> But my question in the first place was: why not syncing the version of jqueryui with jquery? Every new version of jquery generate a simpler code of jqueryui
[09:13:03] <scott_gonzalez_> This module can then be excluded by users who have newer versions of jQuery.
[09:13:13] <scott_gonzalez_> Because that's terrible for our users.
[09:13:51] <scott_gonzalez_> Also, it's far from true that every new version of jQuery would result in simpler code for jQuery UI.
[09:14:07] <Mr21> I dont have experience about project with a lot of users, so maybe my question was obvious.
[09:14:21] <scott_gonzalez_> Most new versions of jQuery buy us very little in terms of API benefits.
[09:15:40] <Mr21> But you answer well to my question, i didn't know the existence of these separate module, but now it's clear that you choose best choise.
[09:16:23] <Mr21> scott_gonzalez_: okok, thank you
[09:16:31] <scott_gonzalez_> But even without the separate module, we're talking about losing at least 50% of users if we don't support old versions of jQuery.
[09:17:35] <Mr21> ouch.. yeah, I understand
[09:19:35] <scott_gonzalez_> Now, we do encourage users to upgrade their versions of jQuery by packaging the latest tested version with the downloads on jqueryui.com/download.
[09:19:46] <scott_gonzalez_> But they're free to use any supported version.
[09:20:17] <scott_gonzalez_> jQuery UI 1.12.0 drops support for jQuery 1.6.x, raising the dependency to 1.7+.
[09:21:52] <Mr21> Oh great, perfect :)
