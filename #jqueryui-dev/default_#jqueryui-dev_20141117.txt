[06:04:53] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: Ping!
[06:12:55] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I don't know if you saw, but I think effects rewrite is ready for review!
[06:13:27] <mikesherov> cc jzaefferer tj_vantoll  ^
[06:13:34] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1017
[06:14:59] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: What's up?
[06:17:13] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: your working on a learn article for classes right?
[06:19:13] <tj_vantoll> Yeah
[06:19:17] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: thought you might find this useful https://rawgit.com/arschmitz/jqueryui-bootstrap-addapter/master/index.html
[06:19:32] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: might have to refresh a couple times rawgit can be flakey 
[06:19:44] <tj_vantoll> !
[06:20:32] <tj_vantoll> Wow that's awesome
[06:20:37] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: thanks
[06:20:51] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: i started just making a jsbin demo for my talk wednesday
[06:20:55] <arschmitz> and it turned into this
[06:21:06] <arschmitz> i need to finish the docs on the last 2 widgets
[06:21:09] <arschmitz> but its almost done
[06:21:45] <tj_vantoll> That makes writing an article a lot easier. Configuring which corners are rounded isn't all that compelling.
[06:21:52] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:22:16] <arschmitz> this really shows what you can do
[06:23:36] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: if you have any feedback on the little docs like header sections or demos or anything would love to hear it
[06:24:37] <tj_vantoll> I missed that there's nav in the header.
[06:24:52] <arschmitz> oh yeah and the highlight follows the section your on
[06:26:37] <tj_vantoll> I'm guessing people will want copy-and-paste friendly examples. So the full code and not just a few options.
[06:26:59] <tj_vantoll> $( ".selector" ).selectmenu({ ‚Ä¶ }) like we do on the docs site.
[06:27:09] <tj_vantoll> ah
[06:27:11] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: not sure what you mean?
[06:27:14] <tj_vantoll> There are view source buttons
[06:27:41] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:27:47] <arschmitz> and you can double click the source
[06:27:52] <arschmitz> to turn it to a text area
[06:28:02] <tj_vantoll> I find the features I'm looking for as soon as I type them in here.
[06:28:21] <arschmitz> lol
[06:28:41] <arschmitz> i tried to make it very friendly similar to our own docs
[06:29:06] <tj_vantoll> Yeah looks good. If I think of anything else I'll let you know.
[06:29:14] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: cool thanks
[07:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Looks good. The repo name has a typo though :-P
[07:25:10] <arschmitz> ha ha ha 
[07:25:16] <arschmitz> wow i am truely terrible
[07:25:28] <arschmitz> yes i know thats also a typo lol

[10:04:18] <Jellyfrog> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/52 a start would be to lossless-compress all images, did a quick test and could shave off 26% (109KB of 421KB) do you want a pr? jzaefferer scott_gonzalez 
[10:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> Jellyfrog: Which images? The source images or the generated images?
[10:05:22] <Jellyfrog> from that repo
[10:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> Still not sure which images you're referring to.
[10:06:19] <Jellyfrog> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/tree/master/app/src/images
[10:06:21] <Jellyfrog> those
[10:06:35] <Jellyfrog> i was guessing those was the source used in themeroller
[10:07:02] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's not at all what was meant by that issue.
[10:07:11] <Jellyfrog> i know
[10:07:25] <scott_gonzalez> But yes, you could send a PR for the images used in the interface. That'd be great.
[10:07:28] <Jellyfrog> but it wouldnt hurt to have a better base
[10:07:45] <Jellyfrog> for the themeroller
[10:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> Those images aren't related to what you get out of ThemeRoller.
[10:08:08] <Jellyfrog> ah ok
[10:08:43] <scott_gonzalez> Those are the images used on the page for the interface.
[10:10:42] <Jellyfrog> ah, thought it used those
[10:10:49] <Jellyfrog> well can submit a pr anyway, wont hurt
