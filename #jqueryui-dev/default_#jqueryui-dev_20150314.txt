[12:20:45] <bigsteak> hi is there anyone around?
[12:44:35] <arschmitz> bigsteak: Hi
[12:44:51] <arschmitz> bigsteak: just ask your question one of use will see it eventually
[13:01:01] <bigsteak> I'm interested in the project jQuery UI-interactions rewrite for GSOC 2015. Can someone please help me to get a start? I have good knowledge in Javascript, Java, and C++, but I'm new to open source.
[13:14:08] <arschmitz> bigsteak: in that case i would start with https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students and http://contribute.jquery.org/
[13:14:24] <arschmitz> that should give you a good idea how things work
[13:14:41] <arschmitz> as far as open source and contribution in general
[13:29:28] <bigsteak> arschmitz: thank you for the quick reply. I have already read and understood most parts, but still I don't know how to start contributing.
[13:30:36] <bigsteak> Can you please give me an example of what I can do now? Like examining a specific file or writing a new fucntion. I have already forked the repo jquery/jqueryui.com
[13:31:23] <arschmitz> bigsteak: to start right now go through http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ and try to find a bug to fix and file a PR
