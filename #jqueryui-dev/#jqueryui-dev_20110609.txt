[12:36:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i'll be back later
[12:36:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:37:01] <gnarf> and could prolly have a little chat time while @ work too
[12:37:11] <gnarf> so long as its not dive headfirst into code time
[12:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> nope, it'll actually be pretty short now
[12:37:46] <scott_gonzalez> would've been longer before :-P
[13:31:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i got about half an hour to an hour now, or back again 2-3 from now...
[13:33:34] <adoven> gnarf: i think we wanted you to look at this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/341
[13:33:57] <gnarf> k, got 3 to review later ;)
[13:34:11] <gnarf> i gotta write an essay about SQL injections for a web developer
[13:34:32] <adoven> lol
[13:34:49] <adoven> i thought you just turn magic_quotse on
[13:35:16] <gnarf> ASP
[13:35:39] <adoven> tell him to make sure to write dynamic sql as much as possible
[13:35:51] <adoven> user input is your friend
[13:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> we closed 13 pull requests
[13:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> and made good progress on some others
[14:02:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/324#issuecomment-1336685
[14:02:10] <gnarf> he responded to that one
[14:02:15] <gnarf> the "why +1"
[14:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> sounds like we just have major problems, which we already know
[18:06:14] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master tashekelahi * 19dcac2 (1 files in 1 dirs): Position: added check for undefined value of offset. Fixed #7458 - ui.position offset property creates error when set to undefined - http://bit.ly/k0MUFN
[18:20:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez / ajpiano either of you around? got a git question
[18:20:58] <gnarf> scott suggests using multiple cherry-pick -n's to squash a pull request
[18:21:18] <gnarf> is there any reason not to git merge branch --no-commit and then tweak the author stuff?
[18:21:27] <gnarf> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40154555/Pull-Requests
[18:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: the reason is because I didn't know about it
[18:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> I've started using merge --squash for multiple commits
[18:23:12] <gnarf> yeah i forgot to add the --squash flag
[18:25:30] <gnarf> will merge --squash preserve author?
[18:25:41] <gnarf> or should i --squash --no-commit
[18:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> I dunno if it preserves the author, I always just use --author="..." when cherry-picking or squashing
[18:30:53] <scott_gonzalez> I updated the section about squashing multiple commits
[18:40:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: incoming push -- hope i did it right
[18:40:53] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master tomykaira * 2c81518 (10 files in 2 dirs): effects.core: Convert elements height/width to px and restore after animation in all effects. Fixed #5245 - Relative width elements break when wrapped for effects - http://bit.ly/iLgPiA
[18:41:15] <scott_gonzalez> looks good :-)
[18:41:52] <gnarf> then you add a "Thanks! Landed in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/2c8151848d191ad9ba53c0ee86b14aefe4288f67"
[18:42:01] <gnarf> to the pull & close right?
[18:43:57] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master gnarf * 1350e54 (1 files in 1 dirs): Merge branch 'effects-clean' - http://bit.ly/j0uASA
[18:44:01] <gnarf> hrm
[18:44:07] <gnarf> is that right?
[18:44:35] <gnarf> that doesn't seem right
[18:45:01] <gnarf> looks right on the pull https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/357 but the commit log?
[18:45:12] <gnarf> oh nvm
[18:45:21] <gnarf> the actual commit that fixed it still has the old date
[18:45:23] <gnarf> neat
[18:47:07] <gnarf> under 30 PR's now ;)
[18:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[18:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, you close it with that "Thanks..." line
[18:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> you can include just the sha, it'll build the link automatically
[18:51:11] <gnarf> coo
[18:51:12] <gnarf> also
[18:51:25] <gnarf> if the thingy warns you about unclean merge
[18:51:43] <gnarf> should you ask them to "rebase" or "resolve merge conflicts"
[18:51:46] <gnarf> like whats the term? :)
[18:52:06] <scott_gonzalez> well, you can either ask them to rebase or update their branch
[18:52:18] <scott_gonzalez> rebasing is "cleaner" but changes history
[18:52:46] <scott_gonzalez> this is a case where changing history doesn't really matter because nobody should be doing anything with that person's history
[18:52:51] <scott_gonzalez> so it's essentially still "private"
[18:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> if you end up squashing, it doesn't matter anyway, since you'll be rewriting history again and not even using the old commits
[18:53:42] <gnarf> yeah
[18:53:50] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/308#issuecomment-1339252
[18:54:34] <scott_gonzalez> looks good
[18:55:26] <gnarf> hrm
[18:55:39] <gnarf> i just had a random feature idea for core 1.8
[18:55:55] <gnarf> there is the $(tag, attrs) shortcut for building elements
[18:56:03] <gnarf> but what if you want to get a bunch of data out of one...
[18:56:55] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[18:57:06] <gnarf> elem.map([ "scrollLeft", "scrollTop" ])  == { scrollLeft: elem.scrollLeft(), scrollTop: elem.scrollTop() }; -- checking first $.fn then css then data then attrs or somethin?
[18:57:34] <gnarf> or maybe .get( array )
[18:58:30] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery.batch
[18:59:18] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...that's not what you want
[19:00:45] <gnarf> well here is the issue
[19:00:59] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/341/files
[19:01:00] <gnarf> nice clean fix
[19:01:14] <gnarf> but uses $("body").scrollTop() and $("body").scrollLeft() twice each
[19:01:19] <gnarf> so like to replace that
[19:01:33] <gnarf> inside the var statement
[19:01:36] <gnarf> you need to get tricky
[19:02:23] <gnarf> body = isFixed && $("body"), scrollOffset = { top: body ? body.scrollTop() : 0, left: body ? body.scrollLeft() },
[19:02:45] <gnarf> or even just scrollTop = ... scrollLeft = ...
[19:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> body = $( "body" ), scrollTop = isFixed ? body.scrollTop() : 0, ...
[19:04:09] <scott_gonzalez> then you can just do { top: endPosition.top - scrollTop }
[19:04:13] <gnarf> you don't need $( "body ") if ! isFixed
[19:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> so? it's super optimized
[19:04:32] <gnarf> true
[19:05:00] <gnarf> my only hate about this patch
[19:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> you can also do $( document )
[19:05:21] <gnarf> which is better?
[19:05:53] <gnarf> my hate - is that he didn't take into account what happens when the tranferring element is fixed and the target isn't ;)
[19:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> I think they should be the same
[19:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[19:07:51] <gnarf> nope, it reverses the direction of the scroll math
[19:08:01] <gnarf> or $( document ) vs $( "body" )
[19:09:27] <gnarf> and if both are fixed
[19:09:30] <gnarf> it shouldn't do shit
[19:09:58] <gnarf> I wonder if I should just write this....
[19:12:34] <gnarf> ?g javascript xor operator
[19:12:35] <bot-t> gnarf, Logical XOR in JavaScript - http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/xor.html
[19:14:55] <gnarf> ?eval function tf( f ) { $.each([ true, false ], function() { f(this); }); }; tf(function(a) { tf(function(b) { console.log(a, b, a ? -!b : b ); } }
[19:14:56] <bot-t> gnarf: SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[19:15:12] <gnarf> ?eval function tf( f ) { $.each([ true, false ], function() { f(this); }); }; tf(function(a) { tf(function(b) { console.log(a, b, a ? -!b : b ); }); });
[19:15:13] <bot-t> gnarf: true true 0true false 0false true 0false false 0
[19:15:48] <gnarf> huh
[19:22:06] <gnarf> you'd prolly kill me for that
[19:23:14] <gnarf> scrollFix = myFixed ? +!targetFixed : -targetFixed
[19:23:16] <gnarf> ??? :)
[19:23:20] <gnarf> works tho
[19:23:51] <gnarf> -1 when target is fixed but you aren't, 1 when you're fixed but target isn't and 0 when both or neither are fixed
[19:59:55] <gnarf> oh well - that clever idea wasn't even needed, nor was it that clever
