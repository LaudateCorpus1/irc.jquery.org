[05:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> Is it just me or are the YUI docs just not that good?
[05:55:13] <scott_gonzalez> There doesn't seem to be any categorization: http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/
[05:56:02] <scott_gonzalez> And the links don't seem to work: http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/DD.Drag.html
[05:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> Click on one of the events, the hash changes, but the Events tab isn't activated.
[05:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that seems to be a problem with the colons :-P
[05:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> They've got a crazy number of events for draggables.
[06:13:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i merged master into menubar last night
[06:14:06] <kborchers> had to update a few things
[06:14:15] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[06:14:24] <kborchers> everything seemed to be working right so hopefully i didn't miss something :/
[06:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:14:54] <kborchers> it was kind of weird
[06:15:00] <kborchers> menu.js was the only conflict
[06:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it was similar for the othe branches that I broke :-P
[06:15:40] <kborchers> but there was an issue with menu.css as well and menu tests
[06:15:48] <scott_gonzalez> They merged fine or just had innocuous conflicts, like menubar defualt demo file exists in one branch, but not the other.
[06:16:12] <kborchers> fixed those and "most" of the unit tests ran fine and the visuals looked good so called it a night
[06:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure the grid and datepicker branches are broken now because the merge removed popup without a conflict.
[06:16:29] <kborchers> datepicker and slider units failed but those are failing anyway right?
[06:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good enough.
[06:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> When someone goes to actually work on those branches, they'll figure it out :-)
[06:16:50] <kborchers> heh
[07:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker toddmparker_: Any ideas how to work around this bug? http://dev-test.nemikor.com/bugs/ie/select-render-add-class.html
[08:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can you look at #4621?
[08:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4621
[08:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> We should be able to just duplicate the logic from core, right?
[08:09:39] <scott_gonzalez> Until we drop support for <1.6.3
[08:32:16] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez kborchers: can you think of any reason NOT to merge menubar into grid and datepicker?
[08:32:35] <jzaefferer> I don't want those broken demos on the wiki
[08:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. I was going to try that later today. Feel free to do it now if you've got time.
[08:33:15] <scott_gonzalez> I was just waiting on master being merged into menubar, but that's done now.
[08:33:48] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i would just make sure you take a look over menubar and make sure i didn't miss anything in the merge with master
[10:12:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: should be - im looking now
[10:12:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: tbh - we could just "patch" the opacity filter in the same way the jQuery patch did
[10:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm fine with that solution. We could do that in ui.core.
[10:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's not much code.
[10:16:15] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/416/files
[10:16:16] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by gnarf37 (8m, 3w ago): CSS: Remove filter from style when setting opacity to 1 - Fixes #6652 - R
[10:16:17] <gnarf> not at all
[10:19:19] <scott_gonzalez> As long as cssHooks existed in 1.6, which I'm pretty sure they did :-)
[10:20:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, we can just overwrite $.cssHooks.opacity.set if !$.support.opacity
