[05:52:21] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I guess that's better then ignoring it on purpose /o\
[05:52:39] <jzaefferer> That was easy enough to fix..
[05:53:35] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...somehow I wasn't watching that repository.
[05:54:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure at some point GitHub was just like "screw this guy, we're removing notifications for all kinds of repositories that he has access to."
[05:54:10] <jzaefferer> haha
[05:54:13] <jzaefferer> well, thanks for fixing that
[05:54:32] <scott_gonzalez> no problem :-)

[07:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Did you see the fail?
[07:26:36] <rxaviers> yeap, I re-run it manually and it worked
[07:26:44] <rxaviers> dont know why it failed before
[07:27:00] <scott_gonzalez> hmmm, ok
[07:27:05] <rxaviers> re-ran*
[07:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> As long as it was fixed.
[07:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[07:27:25] <rxaviers> I'd notified gnarf via email too :S

[10:07:54] <b-ot> rxaviers: Issue #130 by jzaefferer (7h 8m ago): List browsers that ThemeRoller works with
[10:08:12] <rxaviers> ^ I made a comment with action items I'm working on. If anyone has any suggestion, plz just let me know
[10:10:57] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: since we can release DB/TR pretty quickly, I don't think doing thorough automated testing is too important. As long as we document what we support, we can fix bugs as they come up.
[10:13:08] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ok

[14:04:39] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: thx for updating the api mobile docs today :-)
[14:18:55] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi Scott, collapsible events do not all have the event prefix... (create is collapsiblecreate, but expand and collapse are just expand and collapse)... Does the current XSLT allow for this situation?
[14:26:55] <agcolom> gseguin: hi sorry to bother you... I have a short question... 
[14:27:21] <agcolom> I have not used grunt and all that in a while and now I am confused....
[14:28:17] <agcolom> if I make a change to a local file and run grunt deploy, the change should show in my local repo (local.api.jquerymobile.com).
[14:28:21] <agcolom> is that correct?
[14:28:50] <agcolom> (I do not need to commit and push, right?)
[14:32:19] <agcolom> currently, although I am making a change, running grunt deploy is super quick and is does not say the message it would normally show to say a page was edited or published...
[15:36:55] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: made lots of updates to effects
[15:37:29] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery-ui/pull/new/clip
[15:37:46] <mikesherov> there was a reason I was storing mode on the element, but worked around it with an array
[15:38:17] <mikesherov> actually, better link: https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery-ui/compare/clip

[18:57:17] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: draggable demo works fine with mouse (Chrome), mouse (MSPointer - IE10), Touch (iOS6)
[18:58:10] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: only moves a few pixels at a time with touch (MSPointer - IE10 on WP8). still struggling to track down the reason
[20:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It sounds like collapsible isn't implemented properly.
