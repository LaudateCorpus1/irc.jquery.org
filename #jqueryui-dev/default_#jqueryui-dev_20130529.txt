[02:15:39] <AeroHAL> Hey there i got a small IE-Problem with .toggleClass (the UI overriden one) - having an <img> which should toggle to "masked" (css is: .masked { background-color: #ffffff; opacity:0.3; filter:alpha(opacity:30)} ) it overlays with 100% white in IE 7 and IE 8 - is it my fault or does .toggleClass not support IE7/8 opacitychange?
[02:36:59] <jzaefferer> AeroHAL: probably the latter, no support for IE7/8 for opacity
[02:37:54] <AeroHAL> hmm, invested 12 hours developement to create a nice animation and now i find out that this does not workâ€¦
[03:34:06] <Piotr84> Hi guys
[03:36:59] <Piotr84> I googled about autocomplete /autofocus and it works. But my question is how to set focus by default on first item when input field is empty?
[03:44:20] <Piotr84> any1 here ?
[03:54:45] <AeroHAL> why not in the ready block
[03:55:11] <AeroHAL> check $('#myInput').value() === ''
[03:55:42] <AeroHAL> and if it is true set the focus with $('#myInput).focus();
[04:39:53] <scott_gonzalez> AeroHAL: Can you file a bug about the opacity? We should really be handling that.
[04:41:09] <AeroHAL> yeah, i'll create a fiddle
[04:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks AeroHAL
[04:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> The way class animation works is actually a simple concept.
[04:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> It just reads the individual styles before and after the class change.
[04:44:19] <scott_gonzalez> Calculates the difference and passes it to .animate().
[04:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> Anything that it doesn't know how to animate, it just sets at the end (by adding the class).
[04:44:49] <AeroHAL> but it looks like there is no handling for filter:alpha(opacity:[0..100])
[04:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> Right, and there isn't supposed to be.
[04:45:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's supposed to animate the opacity.
[04:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> But IE may not be letting us know that opacity even exists since it doesn't understand the property.
[04:45:26] <AeroHAL> so i do not wonder why it does not work ^^
[04:45:55] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery core has a custom animation for opacity that sets filter for oldIE.
[04:46:32] <scott_gonzalez> But it's possible that when we gather the styles opacity isn't in the list, even though you have it in your stylesheet.
[04:46:53] <scott_gonzalez> It's possible that this will just get closed as wontfix, but I'd like to investigate it.
[04:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> Huh. This article got a ton of tweets over night: http://designm.ag/tutorials/making-draggable-webpage-elements-jqueryui/
[04:54:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why, it's super basic.
[04:55:05] <AeroHAL> hmpf
[04:55:16] <AeroHAL> jsfiddle does not work on IE 7/8
[04:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> AeroHAL: Try jsbin.com
[04:56:38] <scott_gonzalez> Or, if you want to use jsFiddle, you can create the fiddle in a different browser, then tack /show on to the URL for IE.
[04:56:52] <AeroHAL> http://jsfiddle.net/BVtg5/
[04:56:54] <scott_gonzalez> Adding /show will load just the result, not the whole interface.
[04:58:55] <AeroHAL> http://jsfiddle.net/BVtg5/show/ <â€” in IE 7/8 it does the "wrong" stuff - anyone any ideas how to quick fix it?
[05:01:15] <scott_gonzalez> Not ideal, but this will work: http://jsfiddle.net/BVtg5/2/
[05:02:50] <AeroHAL> thanks!
[05:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> No problem
[05:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'll put this on my list of things to look into today.
[05:04:11] <AeroHAL> but jquery ui is still very helpfull :-)
[05:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> :-)

[08:31:50] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez (When you have a moment) Curious if you looked at this ticket: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9332. Do we care about showing a dialog in a native change event in IE?
[08:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> Probably.
[08:32:16] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like we discussed the delayed focus before.
[08:32:20] <scott_gonzalez> Related to animations.
[08:32:52] <tj_vantoll> Yeah what ever came out of that. I feel like was resolved somehow.
[08:33:01] <scott_gonzalez> We moved the focus.
[08:33:12] <scott_gonzalez> It's delayed with animations now.
[08:34:27] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose we could force a delay with setTimeout(), or this._delay().
[08:34:32] <tj_vantoll> Can you think of any repercussions of this:
[08:34:32] <tj_vantoll> setTimeout(function() {
[08:34:33] <tj_vantoll>     hasFocus.eq( 0 ).focus();
[08:34:33] <tj_vantoll> });
[08:34:57] <tj_vantoll> It fixes that IE issue.
[08:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> Well, _keepFocus() does an immediate check.
[08:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> And a delayed check.
[08:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> Man, I hate focus in IE.
[08:36:50] <tj_vantoll> So when _show completes we could call _keepFocus instead of _focusTabbable?
[08:39:01] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..
[08:39:26] <tj_vantoll> I can try playing with that. I opened the ticket.
[08:39:48] <scott_gonzalez> _keepFocus() expects an event.
[08:40:20] <tj_vantoll> ah
[08:40:47] <scott_gonzalez> We can probbly pull out the focus keeping portion though.
[08:41:08] <scott_gonzalez> The event is only used to prevent the default action.
[08:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> So if we just delete that line and then make the one existing use of _keepFocus() just be function( event ) { this._keepFocus(); event.preventDefault(); }
[08:41:56] <scott_gonzalez> That might work.
[08:42:15] <tj_vantoll> Seems reasonable.
