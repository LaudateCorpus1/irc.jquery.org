[05:12:54] <manus> Hey, thanks for filing the bug I reported yesterday, scott_gonzalez (#9708). Just in response to the alternative regex you proposed here, I think we might want to allow uppercase still (DOM L3 event types are case-sensitive), and numbers are not so unreasonable either. So, for a minimal non-breaking change, it would become [\w:-]+
[05:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> My proposal would certainly have used /i
[05:13:48] <manus> though there's also the .toLowerCase() call here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/47db52b9c98a5c593eb86e5b75309568d11b3bef/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L474
[05:13:50] <manus> ah, ok
[05:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> But \w:- is fine.
[05:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> I actually have a patch that changes that regex somewhere. It's pretty old.
[05:14:40] <manus> Oh, cool.
[05:15:03] <scott_gonzalez> Now I just need to remember where I would have put it :-P
[05:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'll probably end up not finding it and just changing this regex.
[05:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> The patch had some other stuff (which actually needed the : to be valid).
[05:15:29] <manus> Haha, those evasive patches. :] Had another related question, but wanted to wait until I had a chance to read more of the event-related code... but
[05:15:56] <manus> is using event namespaces inside _on allowed ?
[05:16:14] <manus> should the regex include . ?
[05:16:43] <manus> like "click.mywidgets element"
[05:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I found *a* patch that has the colon :-P https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/415d8924ec9fa92b0a79
[05:17:07] <scott_gonzalez> Certainly not landing that today.
[05:17:21] <scott_gonzalez> No. You should never put a namespace inside _on().
[05:17:43] <manus> ok, sounds good, was just making sure
[05:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> _on() automatically namespaces, but users shouldn't be touching evnet namespaces themselves.
[05:18:15] <manus> will, I didn't really mean widget namespaces
[05:18:23] <scott_gonzalez> Triggered namespaced events is actually a pretty terrible thing to do.
[05:18:28] <manus> like, externally defined namespaces
[05:18:46] <manus> yeah, I know, but I think jquery might allow it
[05:18:55] <manus> like, for consistency's sake :/
[05:19:00] <scott_gonzalez> It does. But your OS also allows you to delete your root directory.
[05:19:35] <manus> Haha, true. But, but.. I hate my root directory! :p
[05:19:58] <manus> Just wanted to bring it up and be sure it's intentional.
[05:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's very intentional.
[05:20:17] <manus> cool with me
[05:20:22] <scott_gonzalez> There is never a legit reason to trigger a namespaced event.
[05:20:33] <manus> Agreed.
[05:21:29] <manus> I think they should just take that ability out of jquery anyway.
[05:37:21] <manus> In any case, the .toLowerCase() on line 474 might not be necessary (and might cause unexpected behavior, considering case-sensitivity of event types, as mentioned above). Ok, I'm done now. :]

[08:44:26] <arschmitz> gseguin: if your going merge jquery-release into master can you please make sure you do it with a rebase and squash all the commits down to a single commit saying switch to jquery-release for releases 
[08:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> Please do note touch master on jquery-release.
[08:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> s/note/not/
[08:47:07] <arschmitz> gseguin: execpt the authors update that should bne seperate
[08:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> Nevermind, I see that arschmitz is talking about a branch on jquery-mobile.
[08:47:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jquery-release is a branch on mobile
[08:47:51] <arschmitz> lol
[09:02:59] <gseguin> arschmitz: yup makes sense
[09:03:16] <gseguin> arschmitz: so are we good to go?
[09:04:01] <arschmitz> gseguin: can you rebase and update the pr 
[09:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> And fix the authors.
[09:04:11] <arschmitz> gseguin: then ill take another look
[09:07:19] <gseguin> sure
[09:12:19] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I'm going to need your help to fix these author issues
[09:12:35] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:12:39] <gseguin> once I know what to do with them I'll do it by myself
[09:12:57] <scott_gonzalez> The first thing you need to do is verify that they've signed the CLA.
[09:13:07] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I did blindly add just to pass the check from jquery-release
[09:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> For invalid email addresses, that gets a bit tricky.
[09:13:27] <gseguin> ok
[09:13:33] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to go back to the PR and ask them to sign.
[09:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> And you'll need to make sure that once they sign, you'll be able to tell which signature is theirs.
[09:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> For entries that just need to fix the name, or dedup entries, you'll use the mailmap.
[09:14:15] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/.mailmap
[09:14:23] <gseguin> ok
[09:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> Lines like `Name <email>` are correcting the name based on the email.
[09:15:00] <scott_gonzalez> Lines like `Name <email> <email>` are correcting the email (and possibly the name as well)
[09:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> Sometimes you'll have a real mess from someone and you'll need multiple lines to dedup: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/.mailmap#L61-L64
[09:15:41] <gseguin> I'll use UI's as a base, shouldn't this be common to all projects ?
[09:15:46] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> It should only contain fixes that belong to that project.
[09:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> An ideal project has no mail map.
[09:16:09] <gseguin> ok
[09:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> And indeed, you should never have to add a new author to this list.
[09:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> Because you should never accept a commit with bad author info.
[09:16:38] <gseguin> can we automate that?
[09:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> Automate the check for new authors?
[09:17:24] <gseguin> the check against the CLA database which at the same time would check the validity of the author info
[09:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, it's automated, but it can't be used yet because the repo is a legal mess.
[09:17:52] <gseguin> ok
[09:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> You can see a "simple" automated check here: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/debt/blob/master/tools/cla.js
[09:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> The jQuery check is much more complex.
[09:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> When you start with a mess, your validation is a mess :-/
[09:20:41] <gseguin> So I'll straighten up the added authors
[09:20:54] <gseguin> I'll come back with questions if I have some
[09:21:23] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:26:30] <gseguin> arschmitz: how would you do the rebase on the branch now that I pushed?
[09:29:08] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: what's the D in DEBT ?
[09:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> DEBT, it's recursive.
[09:32:43] <tj_vantoll1> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/nzakas/parser-lib/pull/98
[09:32:54] <arschmitz> gseguin: do it and force push to the branch after
[09:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: awesome :-)
[09:43:29] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: what should we do about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/895c07f
[09:43:40] <uGoMobi> should I email the people that didn't provide full name?
[09:44:17] <uGoMobi> and ask their full name or ask to sign the CLA again?
[09:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: They have to sign the CLA again with their full name.
[09:45:00] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ok, I'll contact them
[09:48:25] <gseguin> uGoMobi: oh so you're taking care of that
[09:48:26] <gseguin> ?
[09:48:40] <gseguin> arschmitz: I meant what's the command line you use?
[09:48:40] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes
[09:49:41] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ok, you know, I'm going to to remove that change from the PR and you can add these authors to master once you've validated them
[09:49:47] <gseguin> uGoMobi: what do you think
[09:51:15] <uGoMobi> gseguin: sounds good to me
[09:51:21] <gseguin> cool
[09:54:21] <uGoMobi> I found one of the two contributers that provided an invalid email address
[09:54:42] <uGoMobi> anyone a suggestion how I can track the PR/commit from this person https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/895c07f#diff-81cc714230c9d42f9427ca91ac4d0921R219
[09:59:58] <gseguin> uGoMobi: $ git lg --author=avdijk@econ-c03.econ.local
[10:00:08] * Nikolas Way away
[10:01:38] <arschmitz> gseguin: just do an interactive rebase then push with -f
[10:09:00] <uGoMobi> hmm... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5721
[10:09:04] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5721.patch
[10:10:11] <gseguin> uGoMobi: yeah that's going to be tricky
[10:11:08] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Where are we using underscored file names in UI?
[10:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's not so bad.
[10:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> Just comment on the PR or the commit.
[10:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> I've actually had better success doing that than emailing them.
[10:14:30] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I foundsaw `_` on demo images and some visual tests html files, eg. ./demos/autocomplete/images/jqueryui_32x32.png, ./tests/visual/compound/tabs_selectmenu.html
[10:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...we should rename those.
[10:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> We use dashes pretty consistently, I think.
[10:14:59] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, thanks a lot for the quick review.
[10:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.

[10:52:27] <manus> Hey, scott_gonzalez, just quickly coming back to the concern I had re: the case-insensitive _triggering of events in jQuery UI, here's another fiddle showing an idea of the issue in action: http://jsfiddle.net/gj5nZ/1/
[10:52:55] <manus> I gotta run again, but please let me know if you think it's worthy of a new ticket
[10:53:02] <manus> I'll check the logs again later
[10:53:16] <manus> thanks again, man!
[10:56:36] <scott_gonzalez> manus: Events should be lowercase.
[10:56:40] <manus> (maybe conditionally do the .toLowerCase() if document.implementation.hasFeature("Events", "3.0") === false ? )
[10:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't .hasFeature() return true for everything in some browsers?
[10:57:41] <manus> maybe, I haven't tested it
[10:58:12] <scott_gonzalez> Regardless, I'm not sure why camel case event names are being used.
[10:58:13] <manus> but W3C says DOM L3 Event types are case-sensitive (whereas L2 Event types weren't)
[10:58:31] <manus> www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#extending_events-Custom_Events
[10:59:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, that's terrible.
[10:59:22] <manus> Yup.
[10:59:29] <scott_gonzalez> I refuse to endorse that.
[10:59:47] <scott_gonzalez> Custom events should have types that can't clash.
[10:59:58] <manus> Also http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#changes-DOMLevel2to3Changes
[11:00:01] <scott_gonzalez> The use of a new constructor isn't enough in my opinion.
[11:00:51] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...that doesn't mention the scope change.
[11:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> DOM Level 2 only bubbled to the document.
[11:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> But DOM Level 3 bubbles to the window.
[11:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to change all of our custom events to have a colon.
[11:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> To prevent clashes with native events.
[11:03:30] <scott_gonzalez> I find it really annoying that they won't spec this.
[11:03:38] <scott_gonzalez> To ensure that no spec adds a native event with a colon.
[11:04:05] <manus> Yeah, it's not very precise.
[11:04:30] <manus> I guess they don't want to close any doors. :/
[11:05:04] <scott_gonzalez> That's annoying because without it, it's hard to ensure that your custom event name won't clash with a native name in the future.
[11:05:10] <manus> Also, there's the "DOMContentLoaded" event, apaprently, though I can't find the W3C link.. might've been proposed and nixed, but I see a reference to it
[11:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> But we're fairly confident they won't use a colon, so we're going to use it.
[11:05:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but that doesn't matter. We only care about custom widget event names.
[11:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> They should be lowercase.
[11:05:55] <manus> ok, thought so
[11:06:52] <arschmitz> gseguin: i think your good to go
[11:07:51] <gseguin> ok, I'll land it
[11:08:19] <manus> scott_gonzalez: maybe it should just ne a doc ticket, then?
[11:08:21] <manus> *be
[11:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, we can update http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-_trigger
[11:13:33] <manus> Cool, sounds good to me. Thanks again for listening! Really gotta run now. Happy Friday!
[11:40:07] <gseguin> arschmitz: green button is enough or you want me to do a manual merge?

[11:42:34] <scott_gonzalez> It creates a merge commit.
[11:42:49] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: so I just rebase the branch on master
[11:43:53] <scott_gonzalez> The branch should be rebased on master, then merged into master.
[11:44:06] <scott_gonzalez> From master, you'll use `git merge branch-name`
[11:44:15] <scott_gonzalez> But the branch should be in a state that will result in a fast forward.
[11:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout branch
[11:45:00] <scott_gonzalez> git rebase master
[11:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout master
[11:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> git merge branch
[11:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> There are multiple ways to avoid merge commits, I find this to be the sanest.
[11:48:14] <rxaviers> You can make sure it's always ff with `git merge --ff-only branch-name`
[11:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> whoa
[11:54:47] <scott_gonzalez> I knew about --no-ff, but not --ff-only
[12:09:00] <gnarf> yeah --ff-only !
[12:09:05] <gnarf> i actually knew that one
