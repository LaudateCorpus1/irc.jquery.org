[03:38:16] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: looks like everything needs to be updated to grunt-wordpress 1.0.0 - should be just changing package.json and running `npm install` again
[04:52:08] <alexander_> hi, I have a philosophically question about the underlying markup for ui components ...
[04:53:45] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: that did it. thanks!
[04:54:03] <alexander_> why do you use elements with special behaviour like <ul>, <li> or <a> for example the tabs component instead of simple <div>/<span>
