[04:21:38] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Timezones in JavaScript is so messed up. ECMA-402 doesn't help much either. :(
[04:22:45] <rxaviers> The more I read, the more resistant I get on implementing anything timezone on Globalize... I don't see a use case for it, since Date is so messed up on its regard.
[04:23:53] <rxaviers> (a) user cannot change a Date timezone. (b) user cannot rely on the Date's implementation database for a timezone (eg. when daylight savings applies) - as far as I read, different browsers use different data.
[04:24:55] <rxaviers> I think formatting / parsing timezones only makes sense for an augmented Date object that fixes timezones. Eg. moment.js or another yet to come lib.
[04:26:03] <rxaviers> I guess this lib that augments Date object will be bigger than Globalize Date module.
[04:28:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: Ping!
[04:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Ok, let's skip it for now.
[04:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Is download builder in a good state for a release?
[04:31:23] <rxaviers> ok
[04:32:35] <rxaviers> yeap, it is. One final test I need to make is to double check if the `grunt prepare` is still in good shape.
[04:32:44] <rxaviers> will do that now then
[04:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Thanks. Getting ready to do the 1.10.4 release this morning.
[04:45:06] <NiGhTTraX> scott_gonzalez: got a minute? found another doc bug
[04:45:19] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[04:45:29] <NiGhTTraX> it's about the receive event of sortable
[04:46:04] <NiGhTTraX> docs say the ui argument contains the helper
[04:46:10] <NiGhTTraX> and it doesn't
[04:46:37] <NiGhTTraX> also, it says ui.sender is the sortable from which the item came
[04:46:48] <NiGhTTraX> but if it comes from a connected draggable
[04:46:58] <NiGhTTraX> that it will be set to the draggable
[04:49:53] <NiGhTTraX> actually it'll be the draggable's helper
[04:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> I can see us documenting the draggable behavior, but sortable itself shouldn't know anything about that.
[04:55:55] <NiGhTTraX> well shouldn't sortable docs say that ui.sender might not always be another sortable?
[04:56:23] <NiGhTTraX> or... fix the code so it doesn't set the draggable as the sender?
[04:58:50] <scott_gonzalez> The code isn't broken.

[04:59:02] <scott_gonzalez> As I said, I can see us documenting the draggable behavior.
[04:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> It just seems like a much larger refactor of the docs than updating a single property in a single evnet.
[04:59:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really interested in a million tiny edits to these docs.
[05:02:38] <NiGhTTraX> fair enough, I guess the tests for the sortable should be completed first and then the docs refactored if more bugs are discovered
[05:03:08] <scott_gonzalez> Sure. Keep in mind that we're going to rewrite the plugin from scratch and the API will change.
[05:05:38] <NiGhTTraX> well I guess it should be postponed after the rewrite then

[05:15:03] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, dry tested the origin/1-10-stable branch (1.10.4pre), and all the procedures (grunt prepare, test, and my dry test downloading the package) passed just fine.
[05:15:19] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Great, cuz I just tagged 1.10.4 :-)
[05:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> Working through the full release right now.
[05:15:31] <rxaviers> will do the same for master (1.11.0pre)
[05:15:51] <rxaviers> (so, we make sure it will work for 1.11 later)
[05:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[05:16:50] <rxaviers> BTW, Im considering using live DB for 1.10.4. When we release 1.11, then use master DB.
[05:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> So when I deploy DB later, you want me to do it from the latest tag, not from master?
[05:18:08] <rxaviers> correct. Except if you think we should do from master (if so, let me know so I can test it using master)
[05:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> No, that's fine.
[05:18:20] <rxaviers> ok
[05:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'll change the config in master, branch from the last tag, cherry-pick the commit change, then deploy from the branch.
[05:19:05] <rxaviers> perfect
[05:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: HAHAHAHA https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/6f87ef0c0739d38376de7148b9fbd688f6ffdd0d
[05:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> Not only did you forget to amend before landing, I didn't squash during my cherry-picking.
[05:23:52] <rxaviers> oh no.. this commit is spreading all over hehe
[05:24:01] <rxaviers> :shame:
[05:24:03] <rxaviers> :(
[05:24:04] <rxaviers> hehe
[05:25:13] <rxaviers> I shouldn't have added this TODO in the commit message, no one would have noticed it otherwise heheh
[05:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[05:25:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:25:30] <rxaviers> :D
[05:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> I've picked up your habit of prepending commits with "[amend]" during PRs.
[05:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> I really like that.
[05:26:00] <rxaviers> ehehhe yeap, it's really handy
[05:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> That marker plus always doing interactive rebases = nice workflow
[05:26:41] <rxaviers> indeed
[05:28:38] <rxaviers> Previously, I used to amend commits while I was implementing. It was so cumbersome when I had to amend a commit in HEAD~1 or earlier. Now, I simply don't care, I simply commit stuff using those tags. Then, on interactive rebase it's so easy to group the commits correctly.
[05:29:15] <rxaviers> And end up with a very nice and clean PR.
[05:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[05:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's also nice when a branch is never rebased during review.
[05:30:20] <scott_gonzalez> Because the history is a lot easier to see.
[05:30:28] <scott_gonzalez> You can do large reviews in chunks and just track SHAs.
[05:30:38] <scott_gonzalez> And the discussions don't become impossible to find.
[05:30:52] <rxaviers> very true
[05:31:21] <rxaviers> no need to force push frequently anymore
[05:31:25] <rxaviers> also
[05:31:53] <rxaviers> ok, checking 1.11

[06:26:39] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[06:28:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You know, in general I'm kinda wondering how come native form widgets look and behave so badly on mobile that we should have to enhance them as we do?

[06:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Does it pull the jquery file from the UI repo?
[06:42:51] <rxaviers> yeap, `grunt prepare` will.
[06:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> How risky would it be to make the change to support different core versions for different UI versions?
[06:44:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The API docs actually say that the custom select creates a new /page/ when the list of items is too long. It doesn't actually call it a /dialog/. However, the documentation for the overlayTheme option says its value will be used for the /dialog/ background.
[06:44:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Anyway, I've added a warning paragraph after the explanation of the custom select behaviour.
[06:44:28] <rxaviers> Where would we need this, on TR?
[06:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> I assume just in DB when grabbing the file for the zip.
[06:45:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm talking about changing it here: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/config.json
[06:45:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'd prefer to ship UI 1.10.4 with core 1.10.2
[06:45:39] <scott_gonzalez> But UI 1.9.2 doesn't have that file available, obviously.
[06:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we display that info anywhere. It's probably just in the zip building code.
[06:46:08] <rxaviers> This "jquery" (core) specified in the config.json is only for the served pages purpose, not for the packages
[06:46:33] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, ok.
[06:46:35] <rxaviers>  For the package, DB zips the core file that is in the repo.
[06:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> Then I'm good.

[06:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: There's a 1-10-stable branch now. Hopefully we won't need to use it again though.
[06:51:04] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, there are some open items on the PR.  Some are about the tests, which we've decided to postpone. One item is "Copy updated i18n files to datepicker demos", which I am not aware of.
[06:51:08] <rxaviers> other than that, it is.
[06:51:14] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, great, ok.
[06:51:28] <rxaviers> better having the branch.
[06:52:22] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: Ok thanks. I'm going to test out the branch today.
[06:52:43] <rxaviers> excellent. Please, just let me know in any trouble.
[06:53:25] <tj_vantoll> Will do.
[07:08:54] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Can you join a Skype call?

[10:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> Just to keep it in the flow of announcements.
[10:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> Well, other people are starting to tweet it because of the blog post. I'll just tweet it now.
[10:27:26] <ajpiano> sorry scott_gonzalez on a call, i think it makes sense to RT in this case, @jquery is generally retweeting a lot more lately these days
[10:37:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[10:56:25] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Which build is erroring?
[10:56:43] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile
[10:57:38] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I believe it started with this one: https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/17089507
[11:00:22] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, I didn't understand https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/232
[11:00:40] <rxaviers> To be more precise, I didnt understand the issue you guys had.
[11:00:42] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: We don't want to deploy DB on tags.
[11:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> When we deployed download builder update for 1.10.4, it broke.
[11:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> Not really sure what the problem was.
[11:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> But jqueryui.com was set for 1.10.3 and the back-end for DB was set for 1.10.3.
[11:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> We have that for a short period on every release.
[11:02:40] <rxaviers> oh ok I see.
[11:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, back-end was set for 1.10.4.
[11:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: `npm install` worked for me. Trying again from a clean start (rm -rf node_modules)
[11:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that died.
[11:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> So, there must be a range somewhere.
[11:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[11:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> "dependencies": {
[11:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> 		"jquery": ">=1.8.3"
[11:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think tags do what timmywil thinks they do...
[11:07:44] <scott_gonzalez> There are two problems here.
[11:08:11] <scott_gonzalez> One is that the deps as specified will pull in pre-releases of jQuery.
[11:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> The other, bigger, problem is that the npm publishing of the RC is borked.
[11:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> This has been an intermittent problem with npm recently.
[11:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14702
[11:13:17] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: you're a genius :)
[11:13:39] <gseguin> ok so should I specify a fixed version of jquery? 
[11:15:05] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: but that hasn't changed for months so that's weird it's failing now
[11:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> Not really.
[11:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery hasn't had a broken npm package before.
[11:16:41] <gseguin> oh ok so it's not really a mistake I made, it's more of an unfortunate combination of things
[11:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[11:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> The first commit after the jQuery release was bound to fail.
[11:17:22] <gseguin> when is that going to get fixed? can I work around it in the meantime?
[11:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: We need to wait until someone with access is around and can republish.
[11:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> See #jquery-dev
[11:25:45] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: ok, thank you

[12:11:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[12:11:10] <arschmitz> question about swipe pr
[12:11:17] <_|Nix|_> Shoot!
[12:11:34] <arschmitz> you added a bubble param but you always send true
[12:11:38] <arschmitz> ohh wait nevermind
[12:11:48] <arschmitz> thats in trigger custom event which is used elsewhere
[12:11:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[12:11:55] <arschmitz> and they just dont pass it so false
[12:12:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but since your here https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/8422773
[12:12:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I could've used trigger, thus effectively reverting the commit where you moved to using triggerCustomEvent, but I figured I don't want to do that because there may be other things in there I don't want to revert.
[12:13:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah id have to look back at what i was fixing and if there is anything else going on with that
[12:13:27] <arschmitz> it was to fix a delegation issue
[12:14:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that gist is my latest version of animation complete i keep finding better ways to write it lol
[12:14:48] <arschmitz> that one includes moving the support tests
[12:14:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. In fact, we should check to make sure that https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6235 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5311 continue to remain fixed after this commit.
[12:15:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... looking over it. So far, only a minor thing: You need to outdent the $.each() by one.
[12:15:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: should probably do it before actually :)
[12:15:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think thats just the gist the the indents look messed up
[12:15:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's what I mean. I wasn't sure about how to reproduce those bugs.
[12:16:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK. NM.
[12:16:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5311 is precisely what I avoided while keeping the bubbling.
[12:17:24] <arschmitz> yeah i think so
[12:17:36] <arschmitz> yours is the actual fix mine was an "Attempt" lol
[12:18:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I'll tell you this: I learned a lot about special event handlers in the process.
[12:18:49] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:19:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and there's actually a bit of a sore spot in the swipe PR: I use a hash where the keys are DOM elements.
[12:19:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i noticed that
[12:19:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Now, normally that's a really bad idea, but I'm relying on core always calling teardown for every setup, and I make sure to remove the key during teardown to avoid leaks.
[12:20:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The alternative would be to use $.data( thisObject, "jqmSwipeEventContext" ) or something.
[12:21:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: should we be clearing the key for the current one in remove?
[12:21:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I'm not sure which one is better. If we use $.data() we're adding to the data load, and it's visible, whereas if we do what I did in the PR, it's not visible, but it may not be as cross-browser.
[12:22:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, presumably the "this" for remove is the exact same "this" as the one for setup has been.
[12:23:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right so we dont need to worry about it there
[12:23:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[12:23:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The only reason this juggling is necessary is to avoid doing something like $( this ).off( touchStartEvent ) which could remove other handlers too.
[12:23:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but I'd like to start doing that ...
[12:24:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and, aside from $.data(), I can't think of another way of storing the three handlers.
[12:25:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wish setup and teardown were within a closure each time they are called, but they're not.
[12:25:53] <arschmitz> yeah i always miss that in special events i want them to be like a widget
[12:25:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The only thing they share is the element that is "this".
[12:26:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly - instantiate one on an element.
[12:26:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But look at widgets: They also use $.data() ...
[12:27:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the end, a widget is nothing more that $.data( element, "ns-widgetname" );
[12:27:16] <arschmitz> yup
[12:27:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, now that I've said that, I guess it wouldn't be murder to do the same for special events.
[12:28:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... instead of the use-the-element-as-the-key thing ... *shrug*
[12:28:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: $.data( this, "mobile-swipeevent" ) ... *shrug*
[12:28:22] <arschmitz> yeah seems logical
[12:28:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or, I dunno ... mobile-event-swipe ...
[12:29:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In a sense, we're duplicating what core is doing.
[12:29:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Core is storing event handlers as $._data( element, "events" );
[12:29:41] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:29:51] <arschmitz> iv been dealing with that in my tests for animation complete
[12:30:12] <arschmitz> because i check the number of bound events and ensure none remain after the callback in tests
[12:30:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... so if we end up using this more widely, for all kinds of events, we should probably 1. Use $.data( element, "mobile-events" ) and then confine ourselves to a single structure for all special events we have, and 2. Try to then switch from $.data to $._data - assuming it's kosher what with it being private 'n all.
[12:31:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's how I actually debugged it :)
[12:31:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah maybe we should talk to core and maybe scott_gonzalez or kborchers 
[12:31:51] <arschmitz> get this right the first time
[12:32:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed.
[12:32:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: _data does seem like it would make sense because they are using it for events
[12:32:30] <arschmitz> which is basicly exactly what you want to do
[12:32:42] <arschmitz> but i dont know 
[12:33:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: often a big difference between seems and should lol
[12:34:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... I guess core could introduce a context object that gets passed to setup and teardown and store it in $._data();

[12:34:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, they could say that there's already a mechanism for storing arbitrary data on elements. It's called $.data() : )
[12:35:01] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:36:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I'll change the PR to use $.data(  "mobile-events" ) and a structure that can later accommodate all mobile events.
[12:36:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Switching to any other implementation that will allow you to store arbitrary data, including the element-name-is-the-key thing that is in place now will be trivial afterwards.
[12:42:20] <gseguin> uGoMobi: you there?
[12:52:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can almost envision a special event factory akin to the widget factory: $.mobile.event.swipe = $.specialEvent( "swipe", { setup: function() {}, teardown: function() {} }); where $.specialEvent( name, proto ) would return $.extend( {}, basicEventUtilities, proto ); ... but NM ... :)

[13:45:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/8422773#file-animationcomplete-js-L74 - why not put this on $.fn.animationComplete.defaultTimeout or .defaults.timeout?
[13:45:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: consistancy
[13:46:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. +1
[13:46:20] <arschmitz> all the other settings on $.mobile for init are that way so i stuck with it
[13:46:54] <arschmitz> hmm this assumes $.mobile exists i should not make that assumption since this has no dependency
[13:47:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. ... and I'm assuming the support stuff will go into support, right?
[13:47:58] <arschmitz> no i took it out of support
[13:48:05] <arschmitz> because its only used by this one file
[13:48:20] <arschmitz> so it should not depend on support
[13:48:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are the support values public API?
[13:48:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Core says no.
[13:48:57] <arschmitz> they are deprecated
[13:49:03] <arschmitz> but they will not go anywhere
[13:49:07] <arschmitz> they no we use it
[13:49:28] <arschmitz> they just dont populate it anymore its just an empty object
[13:49:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but I'm thinking about those devs who want to use $.support.cssTransitions but do not want $.fn.animationComplete
[13:49:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Currently, they can have that.
[13:50:11] <arschmitz> they cant have it
[13:50:19] <arschmitz> thats not public api
[13:50:26] <arschmitz> so we make no gurantee its not documented
[13:50:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's what core said too ... 
[13:50:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, alright.
[13:51:17] <arschmitz> it makes no sense to depend on the entire support file
[13:51:27] <arschmitz> when its only used by animation complete
[13:51:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono, but we could split it out.
[13:51:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That way, if people want it [‚úì]
[13:51:52] <arschmitz> i dont think thats needed
[13:52:48] <arschmitz> we have never even documented that those exist
[13:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: build should work now
[13:53:24] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: thanks I'll kick on off
[13:53:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We use those values and only those values in jquery.mobile.navigation.js and transitions/transition.js
[13:54:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you were to split it out into its own module, those other two would not need to pull all of support.
[13:54:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats changed in my code
[13:54:21] <arschmitz> its not used in either of those 
[13:54:26] <arschmitz> only in animationComplete
[13:55:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK. In that case, I guess it can stay - but in that case, you need not stick it on $.support. You can just keep it inside the IIFE.
[13:55:40] <arschmitz> i did that incase people found it and are using it so we wont break their code where we dont need to
[13:56:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh i lied though transition.js still uses them but that depends on animationComplete so it does not matter still
[13:58:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, duh! I checked inside jquery.mobile.navigation.js, and yes, it uses it - inside $.fn.animationComplete() *facepalm*
[13:58:10] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:58:16] <arschmitz> right
[13:58:33] <_|Nix|_> OK. In that case, I'd say good to go ...
[13:59:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: kind of both comforting and ammusing that the tests for this file are over 2.5X as many lines as the file is to start
[13:59:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just can't help thinking the support thing is kinda circular :) OTOH, we don't guarantee anything about $.support, but OTOH, we don't wanna unnecessarily break people's code :)
[13:59:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's testing the crap out of things if I've ever seen such :)
[14:00:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: difference is one is a potentially breaking things the other is just not offering an option in the builder
[14:02:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... it'll be interesting to see if there are any people out there who use exclusively our support tests and nothing else, and of those they make use of these two.
[14:03:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because if they use our transitions, they'll have our support tests.
[14:03:45] <_|Nix|_> ... for transitions.
[14:04:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if they want them they will have to get animationComplete too
[14:06:11] <arschmitz> also modules have changed from release to release we have never guranteed those either
[14:07:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Come to think of it, jquery.mobile.support.touch.js is already in a precarious position by that definition. It's only used by events/touch.js, AFAICT.
[14:08:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Currently it's only referenced from jquery.mobile.support.js (presumably) so support tests may be a complete offering.
[14:09:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Same thing for jquery.mobile.support.orientation - only used by js/events/orientationchange.js
[14:11:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: iv been meaning to ask are you going to be in san diego?
[14:12:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I doubt it.
[14:12:35] <arschmitz> me too if you dont know since its past the registration deadline and is in like 2 weeks
[14:14:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I doubt I'll be too mobile this year. Our routine of the past three years will be shaken, because my wife's stay-at-home period is ending, so we'll have to get into the whole both-of-us-are-working rhythm.
[14:14:57] <_|Nix|_> Haha! "mobile" ... *grin*
[14:15:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But, hopefully by fall I may be able to join an event somewhere.
[14:16:15] <arschmitz> there is chicago in august
[14:17:14] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's a strong "maybe" :)
[14:19:38] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I am here now
[14:22:30] <benth> process question... i've submitted a pull request on a filed bug. should i update the bug to link to the pull req?
[14:23:34] <_|Nix|_> benth: The commit messages in your pull request should contain "Fixes gh-nnnn" where nnnn is the bug number
[14:23:44] <_|Nix|_> benth: That should cause github to create the link for you.
[14:23:57] <_|Nix|_> benth: http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/#commit-guidelines
[14:24:04] <benth> ah, i think i messed that up, i did "Fixes #nnn"
[14:24:19] <_|Nix|_> benth: That should actually also work, AFAIK.
[14:24:25] <benth> OK
[14:24:27] <arschmitz> benth: what project is it for is it a github or a trac issue?
[14:24:45] <benth> jquery-ui, bug is on trac
[14:24:51] <_|Nix|_> Aaah, yes. Good point!
[14:24:53] <arschmitz> so you did it corret then
[14:24:57] <benth> ok. cool.
[14:34:00] <gseguin> uGoMobi: just wanted to let you know that the code coverage should now be reported when all jobs are done
[14:34:27] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok, that's great
[14:34:32] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I forwarded you the email from Nick from coveralls
[14:34:33] <uGoMobi> gseguin: did they make a change?
[14:34:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: saw the email cool that they have used jqm
[14:34:59] <gseguin> yeah he did the change within a few hours
[14:35:03] <uGoMobi> didn't read the email yet... catching up now
[14:35:22] <gseguin> and now checks that the build is finished before their github commenter comments on the PR
[14:36:17] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: build is now working, thanks
[15:10:58] <bdowling> q: regarding the commit messages ^^^ , is there a time/reason to use gh-nnn vs the #nnn ? (the #nn working in more clients properly, like mobile).
[15:20:54] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#1232 (master - 66404fd : Ghislain Seguin): The build passed.
