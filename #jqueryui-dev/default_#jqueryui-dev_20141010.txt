[02:27:24] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: ping
[02:50:34] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: I pinged you about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7770 but already commented on the ticket
[03:46:21] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ping!
[04:51:24] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: Pong!
[04:51:36] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: hey!
[04:51:51] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: are we going to add button option inline in an extension?
[04:52:00] <arschmitz> yes 
[04:52:19] <arschmitz> wait no thats just a class right
[04:52:22] <arschmitz> so no need
[04:52:45] <jasperdegroot> yeah, it's just a matter of adding ui-button-inline class
[04:55:34] <arschmitz> so no it wont be an option then
[04:55:42] <arschmitz> only for backcompat
[04:55:56] <jasperdegroot> right
[04:56:39] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: on our demo page I'll just show an example of how to make a button inline by simply adding that class to your markup
[04:59:42] <arschmitz> yup
[05:34:42] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Roger.
[05:35:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey! /Are/ we gonna do 1.4.5? i.e., did you have a chance to check on the status of that iOS8 crash?
[05:35:43] <arschmitz> i didnt let me make sure my phone is up to date and ill check right now
[05:37:17] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I ask because if we're gonna do a 1.4.5, we may want to put in a 1.4.5-able version of your new autoinit because of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7719
[05:37:45] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We could yank the stuff out of page and walk the constructor tree in .enhanceWithin() without introducing the full autoinit module.
[05:38:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... because I bet we have a ton of load order issues when using requirejs.
[05:39:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah just need to think about it to be sure we wont potentially break anything 
[05:39:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: seems like it should be fine though
[05:39:45] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, NM ... dang ... I just realized. We'll have load order issues no matter what. If we don't port the new autoinit to 1.4.5, the page may load after all the widgets, in which case it fails to register them.
[05:40:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: If we do backport it, the page may load before all the widgets, in which case it will enhance before any of the constructors have been defined.
[05:41:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I think we should document that the proper way to use autoinit with requirejs is to require( [ "widget1", "widget2", ... ], function() { require([ "page" ], function() { $( "#my-page" ).page(); }))'
[05:41:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's the proper way with the new autoinit.
[05:42:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: With the old autoinit, the order is the opposite. When page is satisfied, satisfy all the widgets, and within that instantiate the page widget.
[05:44:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Either way ... page can never be loaded completely independently.
[05:44:33] <gabriel_schulhof> No, sorry.
[05:44:53] <gabriel_schulhof> page can never be instantiated while oblivious as to whether all parts of the library have loaded.
[05:45:28] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or at least the widget-parts of the library.
[05:45:29] <arschmitz> BOOM! they fixed it
[05:45:36] <jasperdegroot> awesome!
[05:45:38] <arschmitz> no crashing
[05:45:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Sweeeeeeeeeeeet!
[05:46:01] <gabriel_schulhof> O Tannenbaum! O Tannenbaum!
[05:46:13] <gabriel_schulhof> (evergreen, get it?)
[05:46:23] <arschmitz> lol
[05:46:24] <gabriel_schulhof> OKOK, if you wanna shoot me for this, get in line :)
[05:46:32] <jasperdegroot> Christmas came early this year?
[05:46:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, this just pulled the rug out from under 1.4.5.
[05:47:11] <jasperdegroot> yeah, let's remove that milestone again
[05:47:29] <arschmitz> yeah im testing the other issues but i dont think any are serious enough that it should be a big deal
[05:47:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, move to 1.5.0, right?
[05:48:03] <jasperdegroot> yes
[05:48:10] <jasperdegroot> and then remove
[05:48:22] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: You do it. Last time I did a bulk operation on issues, things went south.
[05:48:30] <jasperdegroot> lol
[05:48:38] <jasperdegroot> sure
[05:48:52] <jasperdegroot> I'll wait until arschmitz is done with testing
[05:49:01] <gabriel_schulhof> Nono. I know. Let cgack do it :) No pressure or anything :)
[05:49:07] <jasperdegroot> haha
[05:49:23] <jasperdegroot> new ticket count: 0
[05:49:24] <jasperdegroot> :D
[05:49:31] <cgack> do what now?

[05:50:18] <cgack> gabriel_schulhof: super
[05:51:07] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: We're gonna move everything from 1.4.5 to 1.5.0, since Apple's removed the only reason we'd do a 1.4.5.
[05:51:52] <cgack> how very nice of them
[05:52:02] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Last time I tried to move issue to another milestone or remove a label or whatever, I did a bulk operation in the issues list and I removed a label from all the issues. So, I had to go find each and every one again and re-add the label.
[05:52:34] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Yeah, awesome! Now, we can really, truly concentrate on 1.5.0.
[05:54:37] <arschmitz> ok so i closed 2 of the 4
[05:54:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice!
[05:55:02] <arschmitz> i need to get ios7 to check the last one because im pretty sure the person is wrong about this ever working
[05:55:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice indeed when we get some support from the browser makers. Too bad the severity has to be on the order of a crash :/
[05:55:18] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7678
[05:55:33] <arschmitz> pretty sure thats just how ios webviews work
[05:55:59] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll BBL.
[05:58:08] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: shall I move 1.4.5 tickets to 1.5?
[05:58:45] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah this is kinda serious https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7663
[05:58:55] <arschmitz> but i also dont think there is anything we can do about it 
[05:59:10] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, just saw your comment
[05:59:20] <jasperdegroot> I agree
[06:00:25] <arschmitz> i cant imagine anything we could do to cause or fix this
[06:00:35] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I wonder if it will also happen without JQM
[06:00:54] <arschmitz> very possible
[06:01:11] <arschmitz> it seems like the link binding is just gone
[06:01:21] <arschmitz> because active state is not removed there is no loader nothing
[06:02:13] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[06:02:34] <jasperdegroot> we could start by testing with normal link instead of a button
[06:03:10] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: bad news https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7685#issuecomment-58651976

[06:29:46] <ldeluca> arschmitz: So I was able to reproduce an issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6582
[06:30:02] <ldeluca> Any advice on how to go about tracking down the culprit?  
[06:30:47] <arschmitz> just to check did you reproduce that with latest or 1.3?
[06:31:00] <ldeluca> latest
[06:31:03] <arschmitz> ok
[06:31:14] <jquicommit> [13globalize] 15rxaviers closed issue #187: Bad defaults for date parsing/formatting 02http://git.io/vueMIw
[06:31:16] <arschmitz> so i would guess its css related 
[06:31:29] <arschmitz> something related to overflow maybe
[06:31:57] <arschmitz> thats where i would start
[06:32:28] <arschmitz> it should be overflow-x: hidden
[06:32:36] <arschmitz> which should prevent a scroll bar
[06:32:45] <ldeluca> arschmitz: okay, looking, thanks

[06:44:37] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #6574: AJAX navigation not working on Windows phone 02http://git.io/wF_iog
[06:46:03] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Can you please verify that https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6574 is fixed? It's Cordova on Windows 8. The PR I sent to Cordova was accepted and a release was made with it, but I never really got a chance to verify that it works because I think my developer trial period with M$ expired.
[06:46:23] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: They sure make it difficult to write apps for their platform ...
[06:47:44] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: I don't have a windows setup.  I mostly just test android and ios.  I can attempt to setup on my mac though
[06:48:44] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: It's not a huge priority, but it'd be nice to know once and for all. I just had someone comment after the bug was closed that they can still reproduce it, but they did say with /PhoneGap/, which is known to disallow Ajax on Windows, unlike Cordova, which allows it.
[06:49:17] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: So, this is confirmation of neither a fix nor a non-fix - it just stirs my unease at not having verification.
[06:50:00] <gabriel_schulhof> ... if I put any more negatives in this space, the Universe will implode.
[07:14:57] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: do you have a zip file of your cordova app to test so I don't have to reproduce?
[07:15:19] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: or a link to it in github world.  
[07:15:40] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: I have a friend who might have their windows environment setup that I could have her test real quick
