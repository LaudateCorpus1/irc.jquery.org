[22:45:08] <faddah> hi, folks — i need some jQuery help in trying and doing jQuery UI ‘easing’ effect in scrolling up or down the page using my menu buttons. i based what i’m doing in my jQuery code on this post here :point_right::skin-tone-4: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/02/quick-tip-add-easing-to-your-animations . here is the code i am using to test if i can make this work — https://gist.github.com/faddah/ceb9f5bb98b38

[22:45:26] <faddah> whoops, that url got separated here it is again:  https://gist.github.com/faddah/ceb9f5bb98b381727b50c3077ccd068d
[22:45:53] <faddah> …for some reason, the “Back To Top” never works, even tho’ it’s test `console.log()` statement does, but the standard vanilla JavaScript function `Element.scrollIntoView()` (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView), does.
[22:46:10] <faddah> i have tried studying jQuery UI API docs, and they are, at best, labyrinthine to sort out and try and find any decent examples for what I am attempting to do using `.animate()`, `.effect()` and Easing. Here is the Codepen — http://codepen.io/faddah/pen/egVyrM  .
[22:46:37] <faddah> [p.s.- yes, i know some buttons and other things are out of alignment - it is a work in progress as i work on this JS/jQuery functionality.]
[22:46:46] <faddah> [p.p.s - yes, i am aware there are huge swaths of my HTML code commented out — sections from Bootstrap were not working or the layout was completely off, so i am adding sections back in, slowly, one at a time, ol’ skool style, to make them all work properly.]
[22:51:50] <faddah> help? anyone?
[23:16:04] <faddah> can anyone help with my jQuery UI query above on .animate() and Easing with scrolling?
