[05:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> anyone have time to look into this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7397
[05:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> crap, that may be a download builder issue
[09:44:34] <gnarf> is it okay to test mobile safari in an emulator?  and where can I get an emulator for mac? :)
[14:32:34] <jzaefferer> gnarf, if you install XCode (requires "free" registration with some Apple dev program), you'll get the iOS Simulator
[14:33:19] <jzaefferer> works pretty well for testing mobile safari, close enough to the real thing, and pretty fast, unlike the Android emulator, which is slow as frozen hell
[14:37:36] <eddiemonge> isnt xcode $5 in the app store?
[15:19:46] <gnarf> I'll review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/314 when I get a good chance (and get more of my office unpacked)
