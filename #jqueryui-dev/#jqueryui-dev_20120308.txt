[06:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I need to setup Linkinus to send my user/pass for ZNC.
[06:08:33] <scott_gonzalez> Where/how do I do that?
[06:09:09] <kborchers> i believe it was in the connection
[06:11:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: don't remember exactly but i think i set the authentication to nickserv in the connection and then enter the password for the server and that did it
[06:11:27] <kborchers> not sure if that means you have to have the same user name as your nickserv registered name
[06:11:32] <kborchers> but would assume so
[06:12:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: any idea where rworth is? he pinged me a couple days ago and i haven't seen him online since
[06:12:44] <tbranyen> kborchers: hes doing a trainging
[06:12:49] <tbranyen> training*
[06:12:57] <kborchers> aahhh, ok
[06:13:28] <tbranyen> when i see him today ill let him know you pinged
[06:13:47] <kborchers> thanks tbranyen :)
[06:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I've got a different username for ZNC :-/
[06:14:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: doh!
[06:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know how to tell Linkinus to send a specific message when I connect?
[06:14:20] <scott_gonzalez> I know the command I need to send, because I've been doing it manually every day...
[06:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> I added it to the Automatic Execution section, but that didn't seem to be the right place.
[06:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> Or maybe I need to do more than just write the line to send, like give it a command that says "send this line"
[06:16:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not sure on that one, i don't really have anything running when i connect
[06:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: MikeSmith is going to write a Relax NG Schema and create a jar that we can use to validate against it.
[06:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll have a single standalone jar for HTML validation.
[06:17:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i think you might be able to do user:pass in the password field for the connection
[06:18:07] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I'll give that a try
[06:55:10] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: what's my best strategy for testing jquery-git against ui?
[06:55:18] <DaveMethvin> i'm using master atm
[06:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/dialog/dialog.html?jquery=git
[06:56:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah i did that and get the same fails as 1.7.1 i think
[06:56:20] <DaveMethvin> but i wondered if i should get fails :D
[06:56:33] <scott_gonzalez> Some things will fail.
[06:56:34] <DaveMethvin> datepicker for example
[06:56:36] <DaveMethvin> ok
[06:56:46] <scott_gonzalez> You get 1 or 2 fails for datepicker?
[06:56:57] <scott_gonzalez> There's one that consistently fails (it's a bad test).
[06:57:01] <DaveMethvin> i closed the window :(
[06:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> And there's one that fails on a rerun.
[06:57:31] <DaveMethvin> also some in slider
[06:58:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, looks like 1 failure for slider.
[06:58:26] <DaveMethvin> yep
[06:58:43] <DaveMethvin> but in chrome 76 fails on 1.7.1
[06:58:48] <DaveMethvin> for datepicker
[06:59:05] <DaveMethvin> rerunning by itself
[06:59:08] <DaveMethvin> same
[06:59:32] <scott_gonzalez> Gah. Leap Year.
[06:59:39] <DaveMethvin> hahah
[07:00:11] <DaveMethvin> damn Gregorian calendar
[07:00:19] <scott_gonzalez> Seriously.
[07:00:27] <DaveMethvin> whoops, one extra fail with -git, lemme see what that is
[07:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> We only have part of our test suite turned on for swarm.
[07:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> If you get any failures against those, that's something to look into.
[07:01:37] <DaveMethvin> i would love to get core testing against at last part of the ui and mobile suites continuously
[07:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> For tests that aren't turned on for swarm, I'd just compare the number of failures.
[07:01:59] <DaveMethvin> which ones are swarm?
[07:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> I can create a supported.html page which only lists the tests that we run on swarm.
[07:02:20] <DaveMethvin> k thanks
[07:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> I dunno, I was going to check swarm to see, but the jobs were all cleared out :-P
[07:02:37] <DaveMethvin> damn! :D
[07:03:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'll figure out the list and put together a page for you.
[07:04:10] <DaveMethvin> no problem, i have mobile stuff to test now
