[05:42:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:42:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hey
[05:48:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:48:24] <gabriel_schulhof> We have a mechanism for retrieving the version and sticking it in defaults.js
[05:48:57] <gabriel_schulhof> We depend on json!../package.json and set version: ( pkg && pkg.version ) || "dev"
[05:49:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Should I remove that in favour of @VERSION?
[05:49:45] <arschmitz> sure lets use the same thing everywhere
[05:50:05] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[05:50:10] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll do that.
[05:51:00] <gabriel_schulhof> BTW: I've recovered my laptop with a new power adapter - same voltage, but fewer amps. Hope it doesn't melt.
[06:13:21] <arschmitz> awesome

[10:21:08] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez & arschmitz: Regarding that Selectmenu height issue:
[10:21:14] <fnagel> Afaik we do not handle device specific height adjustments at the moment but as we plan to "be more responsive" isn't this something we need to think about for some other widgets too? Like: do we want to do this CSS breakpoints or by JS or with a mix of both? Or leave it up to the user to do specific adjustments but provide a useful default configuration?
[10:21:18] <fnagel> Regarding fall back for small devices for selectmenu (aka: use native menu), make sure to take a look at this: https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui-extensions/blob/selectmenu/selectmenu/selectmenu.native-menu.js

[15:39:35] <P-Alex> my name: Alexandru Pruteanu, homepage: p-alex.com
[15:49:52] <M4rius> Hi P-Alex, you should probably hit up arschmitz or jzaefferer
[15:50:10] <P-Alex> M4rius: thx :)
[15:50:56] <P-Alex> arschmitz: Hi :) I plan to submit a proposal for GSoC, project: jQuery UI - slider rewrite project
[15:51:14] <P-Alex> arschmitz: I'm: Alexandru Pruteanu homepage: http://p-alex.com
[15:52:25] <P-Alex> arschmitz: since you are one of the mentors, it is possible to discuss more about the project (since time is the most valuable resource I will respect it )
[15:53:03] <arschmitz> P-Alex: i have a moment right now but will be leaving soon
[15:54:07] <arschmitz> P-Alex: so how exactly can i help you?
[15:54:29] <P-Alex> arschmitz: I know it's late but I'm in time :) is there any gist? pr? or more info regarding the project? proposal?
[15:55:36] <P-Alex> arschmitz: is there any student already working on the project? (I'm also interested in the Chassis projects)
[15:56:07] <arschmitz> P-Alex: please read https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students and https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List#jquery-ui---slider-rewrite for your proposal please see the first paragraph https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List and https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/issues/1
[15:56:21] <arschmitz> There are people that have submitted for the slider re-write
[15:56:37] <arschmitz> there are also people that have submitted for all the chassis projects
[15:57:21] <arschmitz> but that does not mean you would or would not be selected for a particular task we will evaluate the proposals and choose the best
[15:58:58] <P-Alex> arschmitz: there is not so much time, what qualities/skills should I demonstrate in this short period?
[15:59:30] <arschmitz> P-Alex: there are 2 examples of good proposals there were accepted in those links as well as guides for writing proposals
[16:00:29] <P-Alex> arschmitz: ok, thanks for your time :)
