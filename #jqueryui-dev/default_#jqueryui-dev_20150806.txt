[08:54:09] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Sorry for not getting to button this week. When I said I'd review it before this week's meeting, I forgot that I'd be gone for most of the time.
[08:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> I should be able to get to it this week though.
[09:11:37] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok thanks

[12:15:55] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Have you seen the custom dialog overlay swatch demo recently? http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/pages-dialog/
[12:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> It looks pretty bad.
[12:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if the themes changed or what, but I'm guessing that's not what it's supposed to look like.
[12:17:21] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah thats not correct
[12:18:33] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ^^
[12:20:04] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: it looks like its getting the a text color on the b swatch 
[12:22:07] <arschmitz> ack the description of that demo is wrong too
[12:22:17] <arschmitz> we dont even have e any more
[13:04:02] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, it's an inheritance issue in the theme CSS
[13:04:36] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I checked and it's also a problem with dialog page http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/pages-dialog/
[13:04:49] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yup i noticed that too
[13:04:54] <jasperdegroot> so we should open a ticket for that, since we are going to remove the dialog widget
[13:04:55] <arschmitz> which makes sense its the same markup
[13:04:59] <arschmitz> yup
[13:05:18] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[13:05:56] <jasperdegroot> I think it would also be a problem with popup in this demo http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/popup/#Dialog if we wouldn't set a theme for the popup itself
[13:08:11] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I think this limitation of CSS theme inheritance was noticed when we made the switch, but if so it looks like it wasn't documented
[13:09:30] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I'll try to fix it in the CSS or otherwise open a ticket that we have to document that you have to set a theme for dialogs and popups in case you set an overlay theme
[13:10:34] <arschmitz> ok
[13:54:39] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jaspermdegroot opened issue #8260: Dialog should get ui-body-inherit class if no theme has been specified 02http://git.io/vO5dW
[13:55:21] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: that will fix the issue ^^^
