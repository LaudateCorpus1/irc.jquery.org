[01:02:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so no need to add that class. I'll yank the blurb.
[01:08:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: arschmitz renamed content to pagecontainer. That's cool. However, now we have events "pagecontainershow" and "pagecontainerhide", which are kind of misleading in their name.
[01:08:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We're not showing/hiding the pagecontainer.
[01:08:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We're showing/hiding the contents of the pagecontainer.
[01:09:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So maybe we should rename those to showcontent/hidecontent.
[01:09:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The names are kinda long (pagecontainershowcontent), but what're ya gonna do *shrug*
[01:14:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm
[01:15:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this should be page widget events
[01:16:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think so. The page does not hide itself. It's not like a popup that has an open and close method.
[01:16:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The page container manipulates pages.
[01:17:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The page widget is responsible solely for making sure things are enhanced and themes are inherited.
[01:19:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I see your point
[01:21:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but on the other hand you would expect them to be page widget events, that is why pagecontainershow is confusing
[01:22:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: "expect them" like.. it's about the page, not the container
[01:22:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Which is why pagecontainershowcontent makes it clear that they are /not/ page events.
[01:22:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yup, true
[01:23:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The page container is informing you that it is doing stuff with the pages it's managing.
[01:24:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when it comes to event names the old widget name would be better... contentshow
[01:25:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think that's why johnbender went with content.
[01:26:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, pagecontainer is also correct, but in different places.
[01:26:28] <uGoMobi> yeah
[01:26:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and pagecontainer is something we've had since the very beginning, so it makes sense to actually implement it now.
[01:26:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The only price is that we have to rename those two events.
[01:26:58] <uGoMobi> true, so I am still in favor of this widget name change
[01:27:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suspect the path between 1.4.0 and 1.5.0 will be strongly laden with nav work.
[01:28:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... just by looking at that file.
[01:29:01] <uGoMobi> yeah
[01:30:37] <uGoMobi> pagecontainercontentshow, pagecontainercontenthide
[01:30:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[01:30:57] <uGoMobi> nice for scrabble
[01:31:02] <_|Nix|_> :)
[01:31:20] <_|Nix|_> I did say we should go with "navtainer" :)
[01:31:35] <uGoMobi> :)
[01:31:41] <_|Nix|_> Good luck finding that in the dictionary.
[01:32:45] <uGoMobi> well, would be cool if we invented new word that ends up in dictionairy
[01:33:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, let's ask arschmitz about those events when he is around
[01:39:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Agreed.

[02:32:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6365 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/509: autogrow now listens for pageshow and updates the height of the textarea. Should it also listen to collapsibleexpand and popupbeforeposition?
[02:32:26] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6365 by robcaldecott (1w 5d ago): Textarea autogrow height issue
[02:32:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or should we document that it's up to devs to call refresh in those cases?
[02:33:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now, it's kind of a hybrid. We handle /some/ instances of the textarea appearing on screen (pageshow) but not others :/
[02:34:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, we have to be consistent
[02:34:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm kind of in favour of not handling any of them, however, in 1.3.x, we were handling pageshow, unfortunately, so we must continue to handle that and the most we can do is deprecate such handling as of 1.4.0 to be removed in 1.5.0.
[02:34:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: textarea in panel will have same problem, so that's another one
[02:35:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You know, special handling is a bad solution.
[02:35:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is it only an issue when the textarea already contains text?
[02:35:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What if the panel contains a collapsible which contains the textarea?
[02:35:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's always an issue.
[02:36:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The browser-assigned size of the textarea is not the same as the size we would calculate for it.
[02:36:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe we should use the updatelayout event here
[02:36:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Who emits that?
[02:36:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the dev has to trigger it
[02:36:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and in some cases the framework does
[02:37:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we could bind _updateHeight in autogrow to it
[02:37:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The dev can just as easily .textinput( "refresh" ) as .trigger( "updatelayout" )
[02:37:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and then we can have collapsible, panel and popup emit it when they open
[02:38:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's not a perfect solution.
[02:38:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in panel we already trigger updatelayout
[02:38:42] <uGoMobi> if I am not mistaken
[02:38:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What if the textarea is in two different late-showing containers?
[02:38:54] <_|Nix|_> panel( collapsible( textarea ) )
[02:39:05] <_|Nix|_> The panel opens, but the collapsible is still not visible.
[02:39:18] <_|Nix|_> Or rather the collapsible content.
[02:39:26] <_|Nix|_> So, I guess we'd also have to filter with :visible.
[02:39:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's a good point about updatelayout though.
[02:40:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's better than collapsibleexpand and popupbeforeposition and panelopen
[02:41:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, and page should also trigger updatelayout upon show.
[02:41:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Which is funny because the code to trigger updatelayout would have to go inside pagecontainer :/
[02:42:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But that does kinda make sense.
[02:42:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: After all, the pagecontainer also has a this.element.
[02:44:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so whaddya think? I'll trigger updatelayout from all of these late-showing containers, and I'll bind  to it from autogrow, and I'll make sure the textinput is visible before I start calculating heights.
[02:44:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But wait a minute ... that's a big API change.
[02:45:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe we should do that after 1.4.0.
[02:45:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: beta is still not out
[02:45:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so we can still do this
[02:45:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. WORKSFORME.
[02:46:06] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.6.x core build #399: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.6.x%20core/399/
[02:46:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just have to test because if we find big issues later we can't remove it again after beta 1
[02:46:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, basically, we need to remember that, whenever we write a late-showing container widget, it needs to trigger updatelayout on the content it shows late.
[02:46:30] <uGoMobi> or we would have to go back to alpha 3 :/
[02:46:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's why maybe we should do it after the release.
[02:47:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can still fix these bugs by listening for all the different events.
[02:47:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then, after the release, we can change it so it only listens for updatelayout.
[02:47:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, let's do that and open a ticket for changing it for 1.5
[02:47:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll open the ticket first.

[02:51:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what do you see? vertical and horizontal scrollbar, or two vertical scrollbars?
[02:52:51] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #6426: Containers that show/hide content must emit updatelayout when they show their content  02http://git.io/1SmzuQ
[02:52:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Two vertical scrollbars.
[02:53:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Chrome 29, too.
[02:53:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: two vertical scrollbars inside the iframe?
[02:54:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. It's got two. Hold on ... I'm'a screenshoot it.
[02:54:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: or do you just mean that the iframe shouldn't have a vertical scrollbar at all?
[02:55:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, ideally it shouldn't have one at all, but now, not only does it have one (which would be semi-OK), but it has two!
[02:55:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I agree
[02:59:04] <_|Nix|_> http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/jqm/double-scrollbar.png
[02:59:47] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[03:00:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Note that I moved all API docs examples to 1.4.0-alpha.2
[03:01:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess it's because the iframes are not tall enough. Still, there should only be one scrollbar, not two.

[05:17:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course, we need to document that, in all other cases, the dev should synchronously call refresh() after making the widget visible.
[05:18:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or call updatelayout on the textarea's parent.

[08:13:40] <_|Nix|_> OK, so I'm back for a while.
[08:23:23] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: in your release script, how do you publish to the cdn?
[08:23:46] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: do you checkout the entire codeorigin repo for each release?
[08:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's not scripted yet.
[08:23:51] <gseguin> ok
[08:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> But it will be very similar to the other git commit/pushes that we do in the release script.
[08:23:59] <gseguin> what would be your approach?
[08:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> I would do a clone of the repo into a new directory.
[08:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> I like the release script to always start from scratch to ensure that there's no possibility of accidental changes getting pushed.
[08:25:01] <gseguin> I take it you're against a config file to point to an existing local checkout?
[08:25:13] <gseguin> makes sense
[08:25:59] <scott_gonzalez> If you're going to add a config option, make sure the script forces the local repo to be in sync.
[08:26:12] <scott_gonzalez> Kill any uncommitted files, hard reset to origin/master, etc.
[08:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> You also need to make sure origin is the correct remote, etc.
[08:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> It just adds a lot of safety checks.
[08:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> The risk/reward ratio isn't worth it in my opinion.
[08:26:55] <gseguin> yeah, may not be worth it indeed
[08:27:29] <gseguin> thanks!
[08:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[08:28:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i notice your pr does not include the transition for initial showing like we talked about is there a reason for this?
[08:30:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, sorry! You're right. It doesn't. I didn't get that far.
[08:31:09] <arschmitz> ok
[08:31:25] <arschmitz> other then that i dont see anything that scott_gonzalez didnt already comment on
[08:31:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome. I'll merge it. Thanks for looking at it.
[08:32:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can do the transition after the merge. What class name should I use?
[08:32:42] <arschmitz> i dont know maybe like ui-textarea-transition or something 
[08:33:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the textarea commits should really be squashed to a single commit also

[08:34:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[08:34:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In that sense, the close-pr-upon-branch-delete is a good idea.
[08:34:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... on the part of GH.
[08:35:30] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #509: Textarea doesn't AutoGrow height with pre-filled values in a collapsible  02http://git.io/qaOHhg
[08:37:13] <_|Nix|_> OK, that's that for autogrow. Now, we just need to make sure all containers emit updatelayout when they expose subtrees.
[08:37:44] <_|Nix|_> Wait, no! *facepalm* ... the animation ... *sigh* ... I'm growing senile :/
[08:54:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/6365.html
[08:54:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^
[08:55:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: _updateHeight first sets the height to 0 and only then to its final value. So, the animation starts at 0, which is counterintuitive (at least to me). It should start at the old value and proceed to the new.
[08:55:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe I'll record the height encountered, set the height to 0, calculate the desired height, then set the height back to what I recorded, then add the animation class, then set the desired height.
[08:56:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it actually works VERY well as is for collapsibles
[08:56:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That way, only the change from the original height to the desired height will be animated.
[08:56:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[08:56:31] <arschmitz> and popups and panels too i think im just not sure about pages
[08:56:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looks good
[08:57:07] <arschmitz> though i think pages are fine
[08:57:13] <_|Nix|_> OK. Bug: Keep opening and closing the panel while the collapsible is open.
[08:57:37] <_|Nix|_> WTF does it keep increasing the height?
[08:57:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think the 15px is getting re-added every time the way your doing it now
[08:57:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just see that too
[08:58:12] <arschmitz> so you start of with extra 15 then 30 then 45 ....
[08:58:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I get it, but doesn't it first set the height to 0?
[08:58:54] <arschmitz> yes
[08:58:57] <arschmitz> hmm
[08:59:16] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#760 (master - 92fb927 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build was broken.

[08:59:16] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/10939023
[08:59:16] <uGoMobi> I thought we only need to update the height on pageshow if the textarea contains text
[08:59:29] <_|Nix|_> Also, WTF doesn't it remove the animation class.
[08:59:32] <_|Nix|_> ?
[08:59:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: where are you removing it that its not happening?
[09:00:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: this.element.animationComplete( $.proxy( function() { this.element.removeClass( "ui-textinput-autogrow-resize" ); }, this ) );
[09:01:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a minute. I'm using a transition, not an animation. I guess animationComplete doesn't work there.
[09:01:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, how would I do this with an animation?
[09:02:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Basically, I have .ui-textinput-autogrow-resize { transition: height 0.25s; };
[09:02:09] <_|Nix|_> s/;$//
[09:02:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: webkitTransitionEnd event
[09:02:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Great, so we don't have a convenient plugin?
[09:02:33] <arschmitz> and transitionend
[09:02:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[09:02:48] <arschmitz> oTransitionEnd
[09:02:58] <arschmitz> i think that covers it
[09:03:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess if those events are not supported then neither are transitions.
[09:03:19] <arschmitz> correct
[09:06:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This doesn't solve the problem of repeated appearance. It still keeps adding.
[09:06:23] <_|Nix|_> Check the above pae now.
[09:06:25] <_|Nix|_> page
[09:06:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right i was just telling you how to remove the class
[09:07:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec. On subsequent "expose" events, the height doesn't start from 0.
[09:07:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Something's amiss.
[09:07:38] <_|Nix|_> Must investigate.
[09:21:01] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! When you click on the button to expand the collapsible, it fires the click event twice.
[09:36:37] <_|Nix|_> OK, weird ... so it's not the click event that fires twice, but the updatelayout handler. 
[09:54:04] <_|Nix|_> OK, figured it out. _autogrow() was being called both from _create() and from _setOptions(). autogrow does not need _create().
[09:55:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: unless your calling setOptions from create it does
[09:56:07] <arschmitz> and it should not be calling setOptions from create
[10:04:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: textinput is still calling it.
[10:05:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's a story for another time. For now I have to figure out how the fsck is the transition class getting removed when it's not even calling the transition complete handler.
[10:05:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've got a debugger; statement in the transition complete handler, and that's not even getting hit, and yet the class is somehow removed.
[10:07:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, if I restrict myself to console.log statements, things make sense.
[10:13:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The solution? .css({ "min-height": 0, "max-height": 0, "height": 0 }); /* calculate desired height */ .css({ "min-height": "", "max-height": "", "height": desiredHeight });
[10:13:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This also means that on subsequent opens it no longer animates from 0, because, for some reason it doesn't consider the height to have changed.
[10:14:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but that is just as well.
[10:15:11] <arschmitz> ok that sounds fine
[10:17:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This necessity to introduce min-height and max-height is caused only by the presence of the transition. Calculations work fine when no transition is present.
[10:17:24] <arschmitz> weird
[10:18:42] <gseguin> uGoMobi: or any CSS god in here
[10:18:47] <gseguin> in 1.3
[10:18:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. It's like you set the height to 0, but then the coordinates returned are all non-zero. At first I figured because it was animating, and so the CSS doesn't take effect right away, but then I moved the addition of the animation class past the .css( "height", "0px" ); to make sure that by the time the animation class gets added, the height is already 0. And yet, nope :/
[10:19:06] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin 
[10:19:22] <gseguin> how would you do a button with the icon to the very left of the label ?
[10:19:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Ouch!
[10:20:03] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yeah? that bad?
[10:20:46] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'd say <a href=""><span><span class="ui-icon-something"></span><span>Text goes here</span></span></a>
[10:20:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: But I'm not a CSS god.
[10:21:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Or maybe just two spans inside the <a>. No need for the containing <span>.
[10:21:24] <gseguin> https://www.evernote.com/shard/s2/sh/4a31eb94-c9d5-498b-8047-519513f67574/63c4e1d926e7acddd5301bfbba91601c/deep/0/Screenshot%209/3/13%2011:20%20AM.jpg
[10:21:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Is that the desired state or is that what you've achieved so far?
[10:21:59] <gseguin> yeah that's what that is but I was looking for a jQM way by tweaking the existing classes
[10:22:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You mean that screenshot is the two-span solution I described?
[10:22:27] <gseguin> yes
[10:22:29] <gseguin> that
[10:23:00] <gseguin> uGoMobi: any idea?
[10:23:01] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: From my novice perspective I think that it's hard to do it another way, because there's no box around the text to which to align the icon.
[10:23:50] <gseguin> ok, wanted to double check
[10:23:53] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you want icon and text both inline centered, right?
[10:24:04] <gseguin> correct
[10:24:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Actually, you may be able to get away with one span, but I'm not sure whether we have a :after rule for spans.
[10:24:38] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I was looking for a solution using data-icon
[10:24:50] <gseguin> and then tweak the classes
[10:24:53] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah, just overrideing the CSS
[10:25:06] <_|Nix|_> <a><span class="i-have-an-icon">The Text</span></a> and then .i-have-an-icon:after {/* uGoMobi CSS magic goes here */}
[10:25:25] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I am opening a JS Bin with 1.3.2 source code
[10:25:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: 1.3 doesn't use :after
[10:26:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, true. Sorry. Woah! That means he can use .ui-btn-inner and .ui-btn-text!
[10:26:14] <uGoMobi> exactly
[10:26:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and 1.3.x also had a dedicated span for icons.
[10:26:39] <uGoMobi> yup
[10:26:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think that should not be too difficult then.
[10:27:00] <_|Nix|_> span-spam :)
[10:28:06] <gseguin> I tried tweaking the classes but I looked like this: http://imgur.com/Q3cUg29
[10:28:16] <uGoMobi> gseguin: is that an input or an anchor?
[10:28:22] <gseguin> anchor
[10:28:23] <uGoMobi> or a <button>
[10:28:25] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:28:38] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:32:38] <_|Nix|_> ROTFL :)
[10:35:05] <gseguin> uGoMobi: it's not that easy, is it?
[10:35:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: no it's not because the spans are in "wrong" order
[10:35:31] <gseguin> yup
[10:35:42] <gseguin> why are they in that order?
[10:35:54] <gseguin> there must be a reason
[10:37:57] <uGoMobi> gseguin: got it
[10:38:14] <gseguin> show me, show me, show me!
[10:38:40] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I tweaked styles in code inspector, will write some rules now
[10:39:29] <gseguin> uGoMobi: oh man I thought you were just teasing me, like: "Yep it's possible, no go implement it!"

[11:04:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: An interesting thing happens with a textarea inside a popup: 1. Open the popup (notice no animation). 2. Type something that causes the popup size to increase. 3. Close the popup. 4. Open the popup.
[11:04:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: This is in Chrome 29 on desktop. http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/6365.html
[11:05:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: Spoiler: When you open the popup with your newly typed text, it starts out really tall, and the animation + _updateHeight() causes it to return to the correct size.

[13:48:55] <tj_vantoll> Yeah. I had a bad virtual host the first time I tried it so I had to run it again.
[13:49:10] <tj_vantoll> Wondering if that screwed it up and if I should just rm -rf and start again.
[13:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't need to rm -rf. But perhaps try recreating the db and doing the site setup again.
[13:50:31] <scott_gonzalez> So just start at step 9 after recreating the db.
[13:50:37] <tj_vantoll> Ah crap I haven't done the site specific stuff.
[13:51:14] <tj_vantoll> Should that be listed as the last step in jquery-wp-content's README? (that there's site specific stuff)
[13:51:47] <scott_gonzalez> Well, generally you're starting from a site and you end up on jquery-wp-content.
[13:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing we could put in the jquery-wp-content README is that each site has its own repo.

[14:38:53] <Jemt> Hi. Any plans on supporting multiple versions of UI running at the same time? Loading different versions of UI into different instances of jQuery is rather simple thanks to .noConflict. The problem is the stylesheet since the CSS files for various versions of jQuery define the same selectors, while most likely applying different styles. What we need is to have e.g. ".ui-something ul li" replaced by ".1_10_3 .test ul li" (adding the version number to target t
[14:40:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I can add a special case to not animate when showing a popup.
[14:42:28] <Jemt> Why load multiple different versions of UI you may ask. Simple: CMS systems - as an example - ship with one version of jQuery. That's terrible. Every time that version is upgraded, chances are that thousands of extensions break because something changed in jQuery or UI. Being able to target a specific version makes sense - that way developers wouldn't be forced to upgrade code. Example: runJquery("1.10.2", function($) { alert("jQuery version " + $.fn.jquery
