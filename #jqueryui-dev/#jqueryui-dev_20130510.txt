[05:55:49] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, hello
[05:56:35] <rxaviers> what does that guy want to do? Generate the vars-replaced final css using ruby?
[06:06:54] * rxaviers just answered him...
[06:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Just pulled you into a the MS conversation about pointer events :-)
[06:59:46] <kborchers> thanks, reading

[08:38:35] <jzaefferer> Trying to deploy jqueryui.com locally. The build-download task, even after having finished before, took several minutes to complete. Now its stuck at the wordpress-sync task.
[08:39:30] <jzaefferer> Now its deploying categories, one per 30 seconds or something
[08:39:36] <jzaefferer> not cool
[08:39:42] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: ^ any idea what's going on?
[08:39:51] <jzaefferer> have you seen that behaviour before?
[08:41:36] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: are you still looking for feedback on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/951#issuecomment-17602959 ?
[08:42:04] <jzaefferer> There's been progress on #981 and #982, but I can't really tell right now what the state of those are
[08:58:07] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, 982 is on my side (but I couldnt work on it this week), 981 is the one that would be good to have feedback
[09:04:08] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: No idea. Sounds like a problem on your end. I think rworth had a similar problem a long time ago.
[09:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> I think it was some network thing, maybe involving Bonjour?
[09:04:59] <jzaefferer> Does that exist on OSX?
[09:05:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was an OS X issue that he was having.
[09:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: For 982, I just wanted to have some people review the changes on jqueryui.com.
[09:07:15] <rxaviers> ok, I can help by being one :), I just need to switch back to jquery
[09:08:04] <rxaviers> jquery mode*

[09:09:40] <jzaefferer> with this crappy setup, I can't really test site changes locally :/
[09:10:21] <jzaefferer> are we support node 0.10.x? I'm still on 0.8.18...
[09:15:34] <tj_vantoll> I couldn't get jqueryui.com up and running either. npm update was failing for me, don't recall the exact error atm.
[09:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> We're getting close to 0.10 support.
[09:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't done any exhuastive testing of all the repos though.
[09:16:38] <scott_gonzalez> I think download builder wasn't updated yet.
[09:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> But it's just a dep update, I believe.
[09:17:00] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:17:43] <DaveStein> .
[09:23:21] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, will check until end of weekend. But, if you need it earlier just let me know
[09:37:27] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez I can tackle this one this weekend: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/59.
[09:37:27] <tj_vantoll> Does a theming category with a framework classes page entry seem reasonable?
[09:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess the comment and this issue aren't directly related.
[09:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> We do need what you're suggesting to fix that issue.
[09:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> The comment in the PR was actually about widget-specific CSS.
[09:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> But we should probably start with #59 and your suggestion.
[09:42:36] <tj_vantoll> Wow I didn't realize that each widget used to have a dedicated theming section.
[09:43:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not sure that we should follow the pattern used in the old site.
[09:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> Where the generated markup was shown.
[09:43:55] <scott_gonzalez> Seems highly likely to get out of sync with the actual generated markup.
[09:44:00] <tj_vantoll> Yeah.
[09:44:11] <tj_vantoll> A <ul> of the classes would probably be sufficient.
[09:45:44] <tj_vantoll> Anyways I'll start by porting the global classes and we can go from there.
[09:48:44] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:58:14] <rworth> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez I used to have a problem, on my local server (OS X). Never figured out the source/cause but did find if I'd refresh/ping the server it would "wake up"
