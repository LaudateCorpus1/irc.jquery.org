[06:51:42] <rmcdaniel> hey guise!
[06:51:53] <rmcdaniel> I think I found a bug or a design flaw
[06:52:36] <rmcdaniel> if you constrain a draggable to the x or y axis but also use the distance option so that it only starts dragging after N pixels, it will start dragging even if those N pixels weren't on the configured axis
[06:53:36] <rmcdaniel> so either the distance option should respect the axis option (my opinion) or the distance option needs to be able to specify the axis (more flexible) 
[06:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> rmcdaniel: We're unlikely to change that.
[06:55:22] <rmcdaniel> why not?!
[06:55:29] <scott_gonzalez> Distance isn't planned for the rewrite: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137878/Draggable
[06:55:47] <rmcdaniel> oh that's sad news
[06:56:08] <rmcdaniel> I have a footer that I want to swipe left and right on and then be able to grab it and drag it up
[06:56:22] <rmcdaniel> but when you swipe left and right you invariably drag it up a little
[06:56:32] <rmcdaniel> it looks bad and is annoying
[06:57:01] <rmcdaniel> why get rid of the distance option?
[06:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> You definitely want something more advanced than distance for that.
[06:57:20] <scott_gonzalez> You want gesture recognition.
[06:57:24] <rmcdaniel> not really, if it respected the axis it would work fine
[06:58:02] <scott_gonzalez> No, it wouldn't.
[06:58:14] <scott_gonzalez> You shouldn't be able to start a swipe and then switch to a drag up.
[06:58:28] <scott_gonzalez> They should be exclusive and distance won't get you that.
[06:58:30] <rmcdaniel> I don't want that
[06:58:43] <rmcdaniel> I don't want to start dragging midswipe
[06:58:47] <rmcdaniel> it does that now and it's annoying
[06:58:55] <rmcdaniel> I want it to do exactly not that!
[06:59:08] <scott_gonzalez> Read what I wrote again.
[06:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> That's exactly what I said.
[06:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> Distance won't fix that. It'll just make it harder to accidentally do it.
[06:59:35] <scott_gonzalez> You want exclusivity and distance does not provide that.
[06:59:41] <rmcdaniel> it will if it respects the axis
[06:59:48] <scott_gonzalez> It won't.
[07:00:10] <scott_gonzalez> You shouldn't be able to start swiping left and then drag up.
[07:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> No matter how much you much up after swiping left, it shouldn't drag.
[07:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> Even if distance respected the axis, that wouldn't be the case.
[07:00:27] <rmcdaniel> I see what you're saying and I agree but if I'm swiping left and right with a large vertical distance the chances are very slim
[07:01:50] <rmcdaniel> what's the time frame on the new draggable because what I'm suggesting wouldn't take much code and I'd be more than willing to contribute it
[07:02:01] <rmcdaniel> I need this in weeks not months or years
[07:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> The time frame isn't known, but we're not going to land this change.
[07:02:21] <rmcdaniel> why not?
[07:02:30] <rmcdaniel> you're turning away improvements?
[07:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> We're turning away anything that changes or adds behavior, yes.
[07:03:26] <rmcdaniel> why?
[07:03:40] <rmcdaniel> it's unexpected behavior, bad design, etc
[07:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> It's unexpected because you're trying to use it for something it wasn't designed for.
[07:04:08] <scott_gonzalez> You're approaching this problem at the wrong layer.
[07:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> You need gesture recognition.
[07:04:17] <rmcdaniel> ignore what I'm trying to do for a second
[07:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> I can't. Because we will never discuss behavioral changes without use cases.
[07:04:52] <rmcdaniel> think about what kind of sence it makes to support axis locking but then allowing dragging to start when not on that axis
[07:05:03] <rmcdaniel> it makes zero sense, regardless of use case, why would you ever want that?
[07:05:48] <scott_gonzalez> Both of these options are being dropped.
[07:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> We're not going to change how they work right now.
[07:05:58] <rmcdaniel> why?
[07:06:12] <scott_gonzalez> Why what?
[07:06:33] <rmcdaniel> why aren't you going to change it now for the meantime until you release your new code in a few years?
[07:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> Why are they being dropped or why are we not going to change them?
[07:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> Because our API and behavior is locked down for anything that's being rewritten.
[07:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> It's as simple as that.
[07:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> Distance has a defined behavior.
[07:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> It's not going to change.
[07:07:34] <rmcdaniel> then add distance-x
[07:07:37] <scott_gonzalez> No
[07:07:43] <rmcdaniel> wow
[07:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> We're absolutely not going to add new API surface.
[07:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> Just to remove it in the next version.
[07:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> That's insane.
[07:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> Add it yourself.
[07:08:08] <rmcdaniel> so fork jqueryui?
[07:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> Everything is extensible for a reason.
[07:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> NO
[07:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> Read the code, learn how it works, extend it.
[07:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> There are tons of extension points.
[07:09:15] <rmcdaniel> any place you can point me on how to do that?
[07:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> Read the code.
[07:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> Look at the source for draggable and mouse and look at how $.ui.plugin works in UI core.
[07:10:20] <rmcdaniel> are there no docs on how to approach this?
[07:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> Draggable uses deprecated APIs to build everything.
[07:10:59] <rmcdaniel> ugh
[07:11:01] <scott_gonzalez> So there are no docs for those APIs.
[07:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> Hence it being rewritten.
[07:11:24] <rmcdaniel> how about you write the code for me then
[07:11:30] <rmcdaniel> and put it on a pastebin
[07:11:37] <rmcdaniel> shouldn't take you long
[07:12:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I guess it's time for me to come off as a dick.
[07:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> How about you do your job and write the code yourself?
[07:12:38] <rmcdaniel> LOL
[07:12:41] <rmcdaniel> you did that a long time ago
[07:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> So did you ;-)
[07:12:55] <rmcdaniel> it's not my fault this code was design so poorly
[07:13:02] <scott_gonzalez> And it's not mine either.
[07:13:15] <rmcdaniel> I reported a bug and offered to help fix it
[07:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> YAY. We can't stop playing the blame game now.
[07:13:17] <arschmitz> rmcdaniel: if you think its so poor then why are you trying to use it at all?
[07:14:01] <rmcdaniel> I didn't realize it until AFTER I started using it
[07:14:14] <rmcdaniel> but I will definitely remember this for the future
[07:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> This is not a bug. It simply isn't what you're looking for.
[07:14:34] <rmcdaniel> it's a design flaw
[07:14:40] <rmcdaniel> that makes zero sense
[07:14:49] <rmcdaniel> I dare you to defend it
[07:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> I can. I have. I will continue to do so.
[07:15:17] <rmcdaniel> no you haven't
[07:15:28] <scott_gonzalez> I have. Just because you weren't there when I did, doesn't mean I haven't.
[07:15:35] <rmcdaniel> why would you want to lock to the y axis but start dragging when you drag on the x axis?
[07:15:55] <rmcdaniel> what possible point could that serve
[07:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> Why would you want to use distance, axis, grid, containment all at the same time?
[07:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know, but people do it.
[07:16:07] <rmcdaniel> avoiding the question
[07:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> And amazing shit breaks because options arne't omnipotent.
[07:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not.
[07:16:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'm explaining this to you.
[07:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> Every single one of these deals with constraining the movement.
[07:16:39] <rmcdaniel> give me a single example of why would you want to lock to the y axis but start dragging when you drag on the x axis?
[07:17:08] <rmcdaniel> it can't move on the x axis so why start dragging?
[07:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> Because the number of combinations to consider is insane.
[07:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> You're talking about one specific case.
[07:17:38] <rmcdaniel> evading the question
[07:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'm telling you that there are many many cases.
[07:17:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not.
[07:17:47] <rmcdaniel> NAME ONE
[07:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> I just did.
[07:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> I'm done.
[07:18:00] <rmcdaniel> you did not
[07:18:05] <rmcdaniel> deep down you must know it
[07:18:09] <rmcdaniel> it's dumb
[07:18:26] <scott_gonzalez> So is not acknowleding that you want gesture recognition.
[07:18:30] <rmcdaniel> lol
[07:18:35] <rmcdaniel> changing the subjet
[07:18:41] <rmcdaniel> I  already said I would love that
[07:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> I AM NOT
[07:18:44] <rmcdaniel> but you don't have it available
[07:18:47] <rmcdaniel> so...
[07:18:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm done with this conversation.
[07:19:13] <rmcdaniel> ok but for the record, you never provided one example and therefore I'm forced to conclude that you are just being stubborn and I'm actually right
[07:35:51] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15RHawkeyed opened issue #6683: Growing CPU use and memory leak in columntoggle table refresh when using data-priority  02http://git.io/80Whag
[07:57:38] <rmcdaniel> is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js the latest code?
[07:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> That's the code for 1.11.x, yes.
[07:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's not the rewrite.
[07:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> The rewrite is in the interactions branch.
[07:58:51] <rmcdaniel> ok I'm looking at the 1.10 branch now too
[07:58:56] <rmcdaniel> I don't see a distance option
[07:59:04] <scott_gonzalez> It's in mouse.
[07:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.mouse.js
[08:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> If you're going to do the extension at the mouse level, you can read this: http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/extending-widgets/
[08:00:27] <rmcdaniel> thanks
[08:02:47] <rmcdaniel> so it looks like I need to extend mouse to separate the distance in to x and y and then extend the draggable to use the new extended mouse
[08:03:15] <rmcdaniel> and somehow communicate to mouse that draggable only cares about one axis
[08:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it depends how flexible you want it to be.
[08:07:25] <scott_gonzalez> You can just replace the mouse methods that check distance to also check axis.
[08:07:51] <rmcdaniel> ohh I just got the $.widget thing
[08:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> If you use $.widget( "ui.mouse", $.ui.mouse, { ... } ), draggable will automatically use the new version of mouse.
[08:07:58] <rmcdaniel> draggable is just an extended mouse
[08:08:07] <rmcdaniel> that's pretty sweet!
[08:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> *that* I am responsible for.
[08:14:42] <rmcdaniel> heh, I have no doubt about your talents, I was just frustrated
[08:16:48] <kborchers> glad to see the love returning to the channel :) 💕

[08:37:48] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[08:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> That probably just made the repo quite a bit bigger.
[08:45:16] <gseguin> very sorry about that, it was  a left over commit from my work on automating the release
[08:45:29] <gseguin> and I guess I'm not caffeinated enough
[08:50:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Would it be possible to create a push hook for git that checks over commit messages? Dunno how nazi it would be to do that ...
[08:50:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I ask because I recently made a similar mistake. Commit message: "tm"
[08:50:47] <gseguin> and reject if what?
[08:50:48] <_|Nix|_> tmp
[08:51:01] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I dunno about reject.
[08:51:08] <gseguin> you can do a local hook
[08:51:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That's what I'm talking about.
[08:51:29] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I dunno anything about doing local hooks.
[08:51:33] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: just wondering ...
[08:51:39] <scott_gonzalez> You should just be more diligent about not doing test commits in master.
[08:51:47] <scott_gonzalez> If you're testing something, you should definitely be in a branch.
[08:52:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I think I was on a branch. I simply forgot to rebase --interactive ...
[08:52:58] <_|Nix|_> Anyway ... worth investigating ... given time :/
[08:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> You don't look at your commits before merging a branch?
[08:53:09] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I thought I had. I overlooked it.
[08:53:41] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I probably got interrupted by something and resumed thinking I had rebased.
[08:53:55] <_|Nix|_> It was totally my bad.
[08:54:27] <_|Nix|_> Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[08:58:57] <rmcdaniel> variable naming, which is preferred? distanceX distance-x or distance_x

[09:17:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the problem with column toggle table is event bindings
[09:17:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: after letting it refresh about a hundred times there were over 1000 event bindings on the table
[09:17:54] <arschmitz> from the table widget alone
[09:18:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it is adding a bindning for each column for every refresh
[09:19:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just realized that.
[09:19:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: _on() removes the binding when this.element is removed, not when the target is removed :)
[09:19:30] <arschmitz> yup
[09:19:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Should be an easy fix.
[09:19:40] <arschmitz> you need to use _off to remove them
[09:19:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[09:19:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Which means you can't simply use .empty();
[09:19:58] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#1000 (master - 461a6fc : Ghislain Seguin): The build has errored.

[09:19:58] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/13322039
[09:21:11] <scott_gonzalez> .empty() does event unbinding.
[09:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> Though the widget is probably holding a reference to the DOM elements if there were bound events.
[09:21:47] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: But only if this.element is in the container being emptied.
[09:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> I meant that .empty() does event unbinding on its own. Completely outside the scope of widgets.
[09:22:45] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Hmmm ... good point ... so no need to call ._off() - theoretically.
[09:23:49] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Then I don't get why we have a leak.
[09:24:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Does attaching via this._on( someWidget, { change: "_theFunctionName" } ) add a reference that core's .on() does not?
[09:24:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because the widget it self stores refrence
[09:24:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so that it can unbind it later
[09:24:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aha, so we do need to call ._off()
[09:24:59] <arschmitz> its not an actual event binding sorry i should have been more specific
[09:25:14] <arschmitz> its the bindings object thats part of the widget
[09:25:29] <arschmitz> is storing a refrence to every input
[09:25:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Eeek!
[09:25:37] <arschmitz> ever made
[09:25:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ._off() it is.
[09:25:43] <arschmitz> so they exist in memory still
[09:26:15] <arschmitz> yes calling _off should remove the refrences
[09:27:45] <scott_gonzalez> _off() does not remove elements from the bindings collection.
[09:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> We can make it remove them if you call it with no eventName.
[09:29:39] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Ideally, you would have to keep dereferencing (or something) until no more bindings are associated with a given element, and then remove it from the bindings collection.
[09:29:39] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Can you point me to the line in question (the ._on() call that's building up lots of memory)?
[09:29:44] <arschmitz> oh my bad i thought _off removed the refrences in bindings added by _on
[09:29:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Jussec.
[09:30:08] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Nope, because we'd need to track which events were bound.
[09:30:18] <arschmitz> good point
[09:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> _on() and _off() are pretty dumb compared to .on() and .off()
[09:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> For example, you also can't use _off() and specify a specific handler.
[09:30:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/table.columntoggle.js#L72
[09:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> You can only unbind all handlers for a given event ype.
[09:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yikes.
[09:31:11] <scott_gonzalez> That should be a delegated event.
[09:31:30] <arschmitz> yeah now that i look at the code i knew that i just dont use _off often lol generally its handled by destroy which does not care about what events are which
[09:31:33] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Excellent point!
[09:31:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We should be attaching to the container.
[09:32:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[09:32:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[09:32:36] <arschmitz> things should always be delagated when they can be and it makes sense
[09:32:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll fix it, but later, because I have to babysit.
[09:32:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we prob need to wait for 1.4.1
[09:33:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... I have a local branch for such things ...
[09:41:11] <rmcdaniel> can you extend the options of a widget?
[09:42:38] <rmcdaniel> I can't tell if that's what _setOption does
[09:43:08] <arschmitz> rmcdaniel: you can but thats not what setoptions does
[09:43:22] <arschmitz> you just put an options object with the options you want to add
[09:43:29] <arschmitz> and they will be merged with the existing ones

[09:52:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ gseguin agcolom toddmparker RWhitbeck: agenda/updates for today's meeting https://docs.google.com/document/d/131Fon6iAwIOK3fNoa9E_k3_rCzTatRlGCjrpmHt_tD8/edit#
[09:53:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ agcolom: note that the meeting is in one hour from now
[09:54:23] <rmcdaniel> https://gist.github.com/rmcdaniel/7253096
[09:54:53] <rmcdaniel> it's also backwards compatible, if you have a change of heart and want to include it, I'll make a pull request
[09:57:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was just gonna ask :) Thanks!
[10:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ping
[10:47:20] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: is there anything we need to do with the blog on jquerymobile.com to make it use the new template when the new site goes live?
[10:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: You just need to use this theme: https://github.com/jquery/blog.jquery.com-theme
[10:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to do another update of the jquerymobile.com theme to match any changes made in jquery-wp-content in the past eight months.
[10:50:00] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ok
[10:50:08] <scott_gonzalez> But we can do that on Monday or Tuesday when we're together
[10:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> And we can do a local test to make sure everything's working.
[10:50:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll add that to the agenda so we don't forget.
[10:50:51] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: sounds good, thanks
[10:53:28] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: was wondering if we need to do anything with the database because the blog will move the blog.jquerymobile.com subdomain
[10:54:18] <scott_gonzalez> blog.jquerymobile.com will stay how it is. We'll just change the theme.
[10:54:34] <scott_gonzalez> We're not ready to switch over any of the blogs to jquery-wp-content yet.
[10:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> Because we need to have user management first.
[10:55:20] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: right, but currently the blog is on /blog, not on the subdomain
[10:55:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh.
[10:57:00] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...how does this even work?
[10:57:15] <scott_gonzalez> When I log in and look at the settings, the URL is set to http://jquerymobile.com
[10:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> Not http://jquerymobile.com/blog
[10:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, custom permalink URLs.
[10:58:45] <uGoMobi> yeah
[10:58:50] <uGoMobi> just see that too
[10:58:51] <uGoMobi> :(
[10:59:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: you around?
[11:02:38] <uGoMobi> ah meeting time
[11:02:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If I have a fix for an issue locally, can I apply some label to the issue so we know there's a fix?
[11:03:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't wanna use "Fixed", because that has special meaning ...
[11:03:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I guess you could just comment on it
[11:03:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: about 50% 
[11:03:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: extra chaotic today
[11:03:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, that's done.
[11:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: When you've got some time, ping me. Can be tomorrow tomorrow.
[11:04:17] <scott_gonzalez> Need to discuss blog.jquerymobile.com
[11:04:27] <gnarf> okay
[11:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, how do I manage to write a word as long as tomorrow twice?!?

[12:09:56] <rmcdaniel> do you guys need any help? I'd like to contribute something
[12:10:19] <rmcdaniel> rather than scratching my own itch maybe I can scratch one of yours?
[12:18:19] <_|Nix|_> That's waaaay too close for comfort :/
[12:18:25] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: But I get your point.
[12:18:50] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Thing is, as far as mobile is concerned, we're kind of in a holding pattern right now, because we're in a code freeze before a release.
[12:19:42] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: However, if you find any bugs in mobile, please file an issue, and, depending on how it fits in with our plans, the fix may go into the next release (be that the next maintenance release or full release).
[12:20:05] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: You can also submit a fix if you'd like.
[12:20:10] <arschmitz> rmcdaniel: in general the best way to get involved in any of the jquery projects is through the issue tracker
[12:20:33] <arschmitz> triage issues and attempt bug fixes
[12:20:35] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: However, make sure you submit an issue first, because there are some things we know are broken, but fixing them requires a systematic rethink of large parts of the library.
[12:20:41] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Definitely.
[12:20:55] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Finding stuff that's broken is, like, the biggest help you can give/we need.
[12:21:21] <arschmitz> rmcdaniel: this will get you familiar with the code and how we work which helps a lot with further involvement 
[12:21:48] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: If you spot any of /those/ issues, you should definitely not work on a fix before we've had a chance to discuss the big picture, because your work may be in vain.
[12:22:30] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: So, like arschmitz said, going through issues and submitting PRs is a good way to get started.
[12:27:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6656
[12:27:23] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6656 by frequent (6d 10h ago): PageContainer: dynamically injected pages will not be removed from DOM automatically on hide
[12:27:36] <arschmitz> yeah?
[12:27:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Didn't we agree that dynamically injected pages should not be removed on hide?
[12:27:51] <arschmitz> yes
[12:28:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then is there another reason that issue is still open?
[12:28:25] <arschmitz> dont think so
[12:28:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll close it.
[12:29:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Though ... I was thinking ... why do we need bindRemove() inside page. How is that better than simply .trigger( "pagehide" ).remove()?
[12:30:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think our goal should be that we can simply .remove() a page, no?
[12:30:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like any other widget.

[12:30:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not that this bug fits the bill. We should still close it and maybe file another, if you think that might be a worthy goal ... 
[12:31:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: can we not allready remove a page like that if we want?
[12:32:10] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #6656: PageContainer: dynamically injected pages will not be removed from DOM automatically on hide  02http://git.io/zI7H5A
[12:32:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think so ... 
[12:33:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can keep the bindRemove() method since it's public, and if people wanna call it, fine ... however, we need make no use of it from nav.
[12:34:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and then there's that whole removeWithDependents() thing ... I don't think we are really using it. Anyway ... this is nosediving into the nav again ...
[12:42:13] <rmcdaniel> arschmitz: well I pointed out a bug/issue earlier but scott_gonzalez didn't seem interested in fixing it
[12:42:26] <rmcdaniel> I guess I'll just go ahead and make an issue anyways and you guys can hash it out
[12:42:57] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: I was referring to jQuery Mobile, not jQuery UI.
[12:43:02] <rmcdaniel> oh
[12:43:12] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Sorry for the confusion!
[12:43:24] <rmcdaniel> oh well I'm interested in contributing to either
[12:43:46] <rmcdaniel> I'll take a look at the issues on jqm though
[12:44:34] <rmcdaniel> if anyone wants to challenge me though, I'm good at fixing nasty bugs, so feel free to point one out
[12:45:52] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: I was just looking through them ... 
[12:46:49] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Here's one I reported a while back: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6567
[12:46:49] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6567 by gabrielschulhof (3w 6d ago): Toolbar: Figure out why _addBackButton() is called twice when the toolbar has fixed positioning
[12:46:51] <arschmitz> rmcdaniel: there are issues we wont fix or don't consider issues that just the nature of things however dont let that discourage you 
[12:47:35] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Streamlining widget startup is very important for us because startup time is very important in mobile.
[12:47:36] <arschmitz> there are plenty of real issues that can be worked on with both projects
[12:47:51] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: So, if code gets called twice during startup that's bad.
[12:47:55] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Hence that issue.
[12:48:19] <rmcdaniel> alright, do you have a jsfiddle or anything in place so I can reproduce it without having to code from scratch?
[12:49:05] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Look at @6554 (referenced at the top).
[12:49:15] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: I mean https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6554
[12:49:16] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6554 by Palestinian (4w 7h ago): "$.mobile.toolbar.prototype.options.addBackBtn = true;" - Adds same button twice
[12:49:24] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: There should be a jsbin there.
[12:49:58] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: That jsbin should work for both, because my fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6554 does not address the real issue, which is that the code that adds the back button gets called twice.
[12:49:58] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6554 by Palestinian (4w 7h ago): "$.mobile.toolbar.prototype.options.addBackBtn = true;" - Adds same button twice
[12:50:30] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: So my workaround whereby I check whether I have already added the back button once should not really be needed.
[12:50:40] <rmcdaniel> ok I see it, yea two back buttons nicely stacked on top of each other
[12:50:48] <rmcdaniel> I'll get to the bottom of this
[12:51:21] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Yeah, that part's already fixed, but the code that adds the back button still gets called twice. Only the second time it skips adding the back button.
[12:51:43] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: However, the thing you need to get to the bottom of is why that code gets called twice in the first place.
[12:51:55] <rmcdaniel> roger that
[12:52:08] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Thanks!

[12:53:55] <scott_gonzalez> rmcdaniel: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9201 and http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9496 are IE-specific autocomplete bugs.
[12:54:12] <scott_gonzalez> And http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9638 is likely related to 9496.
[12:54:12] <_|Nix|_> I love the licensing of this project: https://gist.github.com/jed/982883
[12:54:27] <rmcdaniel> oh you're cruel, IE bugs… I'll work on that second :P
[12:54:27] <scott_gonzalez> You could try to prove that they're related so it can be closed.
[12:54:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: It's the WTFPL. It's a legit license :-)
[12:57:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: things seem to be cooling down a bit, is this an IRC talk?
[12:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yeah
[12:58:08] <scott_gonzalez> The current blog is at installed for jquerymobile.com and uses custom permalinks to get the content to appear under jquerymobile.com/blog
[12:58:28] <scott_gonzalez> That setup obviously won't work once we switch to jquery-wp-content.
[12:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> So we just need to figure out how we're transitioning.
[12:59:06] <gnarf> hrm
[12:59:07] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally we just keep using the existing install, change some settings and get it running at blog.jquerymobile.com
[12:59:16] <scott_gonzalez> And setup redirects in nginx.
[12:59:41] <gnarf> its possible to proxy just that folder to the old server too
[12:59:57] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the setup is strange.
[13:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> The install isn't for jquerymobile.com/blog
[13:00:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's for jquerymobile.com
[13:00:13] <gnarf> i'd hate to bump to blog.jquerymobile.com if eventually its going to be blog.jquery.com/mobile/
[13:00:19] <scott_gonzalez> And they just get it under /blog/ using permalinks.
[13:00:33] <gnarf> oh so yeah
[13:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, are we actually doing that.
[13:00:37] <gnarf> no access to edit it :)
[13:00:53] <gnarf> i dunno - cc ajpiano
[13:01:17] <gnarf> I thought the plan was to eventually bring all the blogs into one space where we write markdown and push like any other jquery-wp-content site
[13:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but I can't remember if we decided to definitely do the merge.
[13:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> We're definitely making the switch to jquery-wp-content and using markdown.
[13:02:46] <scott_gonzalez> I have an email from April that says we are.
[13:03:05] <gnarf> is it possible we could just solve this problem for mobile now?
[13:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> Solve which problem?
[13:04:09] <gnarf> make blog.jquerymobile.com a jquery-wp-content - get the current content imported as html and solve the author issue?
[13:04:17] <gnarf> whats our "target date" for jquerymobile.com 
[13:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> one week
[13:04:48] <scott_gonzalez> We're not going to be able to get it done in that time period.
[13:06:40] <scott_gonzalez> I think we can probably just change the URL settings in WordPress.
[13:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> NAAAAAACCCCIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNN
[13:11:47] <gnarf> sure
[13:11:55] <gnarf> when can we solve our blog problems :)
[13:12:18] <scott_gonzalez> who knows
