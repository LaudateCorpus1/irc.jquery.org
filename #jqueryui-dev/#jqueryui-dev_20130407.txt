[05:08:43] <sonotos> hi, i'm thinking about creating a version of jquery.ui with font awesome and gradients for backgrounds instead of the img ui-icons and backgrounds. just wanted to aks if there's allready some projekt like that before reinventing the wheel
[08:26:29] <gnarf> hrm
[08:26:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you here?
[08:28:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems the guy who was maintaining the last jQuery Easing plugin has let it's code disappear from his site: http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/ http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/jquery.easing.1.3.js
[08:29:45] <gnarf> oh wait, danheberden already has one, yay :)
[08:30:21] <gnarf> tho danheberden, whats up with the filename of easing.js.js ? :)
[08:40:27] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: there is a bug in jQuery.contains in jQuery 1.7 in Safari 5.1 and Opera 12.10 (but not in Safari 6.0 and Opera 12.14) that's causing a test fail in draggable when running the older version test suite
[08:42:38] <mikesherov> I can either fix that bug that will effect whoever is using jQuery 1.6 and 1.7 in Opera 12.10 and Safari 5.1 by doing a support test for broken $.contains in ui, or I can do a support test in the test suite, and just ignore those errors

[11:48:18] <mikesherov> gnarf: jzaefferer: any idea when we might expect PhantomJS to work again?
[11:48:37] <mikesherov> Or can we at least kill the hanging mobile builds that are backing up Jenkins?

[11:49:57] <jzaefferer> that should help with https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/162
