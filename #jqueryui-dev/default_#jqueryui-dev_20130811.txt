[12:12:30] <ptlis> Hi, apologies if this is the wrong place but there's no #jqueryui - i'm writing in-browser functional tests for a project using the datepicker widget & I need to be able to select a date (the field is readonly & only manipulatable via the widget).
[12:13:25] <ptlis> Is there any way to select a day via CSS selector? The best i've found is to modify the source to add a data-day attribute to the td element that also has the data-month & data-year attributes

[23:10:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[23:10:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how was your vacation?
[23:10:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome!
[23:11:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: My daughter learned to swim - with inflatable helpers, of course, but still ...
[23:11:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh that's awesome!
[23:11:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... the water was extremely warm - like, 28 - 30Â°C
[23:12:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: where did you go?
[23:14:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://goo.gl/maps/ZLfZv
[23:16:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice!
[23:17:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, more precisely, http://goo.gl/maps/CbRrC (about 300 meters from previous link) :)
[23:17:17] * _|Nix|_ should've looked at the satellite pic first.
[23:17:56] <uGoMobi> :)
[23:18:12] <uGoMobi> very nice island
[23:19:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, the water depth increased very gently, so it was totally kid-friendly. No shell fragments either, to bust up your feet.
[23:22:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, I've been diving back into jQM, and I noticed that when using a filterable with a select (custom or not), if you filter the selected item, the text inside the button goes away, suggesting that nothing is selected, however, the value of the native element continues to be set to the old value (which is now filtered).
[23:22:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: That sounds just great!
[23:22:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, it was an all-round nice holiday. Good food, good fun, lots of sleep :)
[23:23:23] <uGoMobi> awesome!

[23:23:27] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6225 by RedWolves (2w 4h ago): Filter: Filtering a SELECT element causes unexpected experience
[23:24:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I see ...
[23:24:57] <_|Nix|_> Well, we do need to decide how to handle the case where the user filters the currently selected option.
[23:25:49] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi closed pull request #6324: Fix 6319: Table/ColToggle - setting display:block to override offset on fieldset (06master...06fix_6319)  02http://git.io/3ZEWDg
[23:25:50] <_|Nix|_> Presumably, the filter on the select is there to make it easier to search for the option the user wants, rather than to influence the currently set option.
[23:26:03] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/vHaQIw
[23:26:03] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 141524ea1 15Jasper de Groot: Core: Prevent additional space at bottom of fieldsets on Firefox. Fixes #6319.
[23:26:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, it might actually make sense to keep showing the text even though it's not in the list of options anymore.
[23:28:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can think of an alternative behaviour for filterable that makes this clearer: When you start typing, instead of hiding items, we rearrange them: The ones that match move to the top, then there's a separator, then the items we would normally hide.
[23:28:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If it were done like this, it would be clear that filtering does not /remove/ options, but rather it simply helps you search through them.
[23:29:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, this is not how we did things, so now it's not so clear.
[23:29:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm, I think I would prefer consistent behaviour across widgets for the filterable widget
[23:29:40] <uGoMobi> it filters, not rearranges
[23:29:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I agree.
[23:29:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I agree we have to do something about it
[23:30:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was talking about this with frequent and arschmitz last Friday
[23:36:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry! I was rudely interrupted by a crashed filesystem.
[23:36:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: aii, welcome back
[23:36:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, basically, I was using the rearranging thing just as a conceptual illustration.
[23:36:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was saying that I talked about this with frequent and arschmitz last Friday
[23:36:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Selectmenu works as though items were rearranged like that.
[23:37:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, what was the conclusion?
[23:37:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Other widgets however will cause form data changes when filtered.
[23:37:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: We were talking about using placeholders
[23:38:29] <_|Nix|_> placeholders?
[23:38:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure if we are talking about the same issue here though
[23:39:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6225#issuecomment-21958148
[23:39:24] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6225 by RedWolves (2w 4h ago): Filter: Filtering a SELECT element causes unexpected experience
[23:39:40] * uGoMobi is looking at IRC history
[23:40:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: A placeholder that doesn't get filtered, so the select button always has height
[23:41:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but you are talking about whether the text should be visible or not
[23:41:41] <uGoMobi> correct?
[23:41:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and whether filtering the selected item should cause a change event.
[23:42:12] <uGoMobi> right
[23:42:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, when you filter the selected item, is the intention that the select no longer has a value or is the intention simply to remove the item from the list of available choices, but leave the form data otherwise unchanged?
[23:43:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IMO the text on the select button should always reflect the data that will be submitted.
[23:43:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree with that
[23:43:34] <uGoMobi> that was more or less what my comment on the ticket was about
[23:43:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In that case, filtering the active item should leave the text as it is, even though the item containing that text is no longer among the available options.
[23:44:08] <uGoMobi> so what to do when we you filter out (is that proper English?) the selected option
[23:44:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IMO, leave the text in the button.
[23:45:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: After all, the user has consciously performed an action, so she shouldn't be surprised that the item shown by the button no longer appears in the list of options.
[23:45:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree
[23:45:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's just filter the selectmenu list, but not affect the text in the button which should always reflect the selected option that will be subitted
[23:45:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
