[10:35:18] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: so do we have a real timeline on interactions?
[10:35:29] <gnarf> scott would be the person to talk to about that
[10:35:35] <Dave_Stein> he's never around hwen i am :)
[10:35:46] <Dave_Stein> i'm at work now finishing up stuff. i wanted to do jquery this weekend but it doesn't look likely. i got sick friday night and am freezing my ass off ha
[10:35:53] <gnarf> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap 2.0 ? :)
[10:35:57] <Dave_Stein> i wanted to do jquery from home but it seems my computer fragged
[10:36:01] <Dave_Stein> i hate that pgea haha
[10:36:10] <Dave_Stein> i thought i fixed my PC at home yesterday
[10:36:14] <gnarf> it seems wrong in general
[10:36:24] <Dave_Stein> but then windows decided its boot file is fucked
[10:36:30] <gnarf> ouch
[10:36:33] <Dave_Stein> and my dvd drive has been boken for months and i didnt acre cause i dont use it
[10:36:37] <gnarf> thats an annoying problem to fix
[10:36:39] <Dave_Stein> sooooo i cant repair until i get new dvd drive
[10:36:40] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[10:36:57] <Dave_Stein> so it's pretty shitty so i think i'm skipping over UI this weekend
[10:37:03] <gnarf> you know you can install win7 from flash media on some compu's right?
[10:37:03] <Dave_Stein> how'd that skype call end?
[10:37:23] <gnarf> i don't think we discovered much after you left
[10:37:37] <Dave_Stein> well i suck with computers to be honest haha
[10:38:04] <gnarf> http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd535816.aspx
[10:38:14] <Dave_Stein> i make websites and well hardware.. i kick it? :) anywho my cd is at home so i'd need to get that cd somewhere witha flash drive etc
[10:38:29] <Dave_Stein> in regards to meeting, i didn't realize how lost we are in the mobile department, or how crazy convoluted it is
[10:38:31] <gnarf> you'll have to reformat it
[10:38:39] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: its nuts
[10:38:45] <Dave_Stein> at least i don't have anythig on there that isn't n a repo
[10:38:49] <Dave_Stein> so i don't care about formatting
[10:39:08] <Dave_Stein> i'll just have to hope my phone doesn't explode when i plug it in damn apple
[10:39:18] <gnarf> :)
[10:39:27] <Dave_Stein> but yeah it seems UI 2 is even farther off, because we're so far off on the base layer of what scott wants to do
[10:39:33] <Dave_Stein> being event handling across desktop/mobile
[10:39:49] <Dave_Stein> from the talk we had on weds it seemed him and rich mighta had a better idea and that me and rich would be able to sync up sooner than later
[10:40:27] <gnarf> rich is gone this week
[10:40:42] <Dave_Stein> yeah so i guess i won't do any dev this weekend
[10:40:53] <Dave_Stein> shitty weekend for me
[10:40:57] <Dave_Stein> next weekend has to go up from here
[10:41:01] <gnarf> sorry to hear
[10:41:05] <gnarf> its been a fun weekend so far
[10:41:06] <Dave_Stein> sick + missing parties + working both days + computer exploding
[10:41:10] <gnarf> but i think today is a work day
[10:41:55] <Dave_Stein> there i DMed you a secret link to see what i've been up to
[10:42:04] <Dave_Stein> so much better than http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/
[10:42:17] <gnarf> heh, i'm so glad gf3 and scott showed up to support me on this one :) http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7824
[10:42:19] <Dave_Stein> only reason i'd work both days this weekend is cause i wanna get it off my plate
[10:44:27] <Dave_Stein> i'm sensing sarcasm there since the other guy is agreeing with you
[10:44:28] <Dave_Stein> :)
[10:44:50] <Dave_Stein> either that or tali is confused
[10:45:36] <gnarf> nah, no sarcasm, that dude was annoying me :)
[10:45:57] <gnarf> i started at his reply and tried to come up with a nice way of saying what gf3 and scott did
[10:47:19] <Dave_Stein> ah
[10:51:58] <gnarf> heya timmywil
[10:57:08] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: i am really unsure why people get so mad when you tell them they are invalid
[10:57:09] <gnarf> :)
[10:57:24] <Dave_Stein> people get upset on both ends of the tickets
[10:57:31] <Dave_Stein> keep calm and carry on
[10:57:33] <Dave_Stein> ha
[10:57:46] <gnarf> yeah, thats why i didn't respond right away
[10:57:49] <gnarf> needed to cool down
[10:58:11] <Dave_Stein> im gonna hop off
[10:58:14] <Dave_Stein> i gotta do this user migration script
[10:58:19] <Dave_Stein> and then i get to go home!
[10:58:38] <Dave_Stein> mmmm porting people from one DB to another
[10:58:46] <Dave_Stein> ttyl gnarf
[16:36:38] <ryanneufeld> are there docs where I can look to see what the values of the ui object passed in an event should be? such as on the sortable receive(event, ui) callback, what can I expect the properties of ui to contain?
[16:38:35] <ryanneufeld> hm nvm
[18:24:24] <kborchers> .
