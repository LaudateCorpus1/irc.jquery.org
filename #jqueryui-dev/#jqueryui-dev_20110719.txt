[08:18:16] <kborchers> jzaefferer: got a second? i'm back on navigation menu and it works but i don't like what i had to do to focus the anchor and wondering if you might have another suggestion https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/6debae25dc5e8df27f558a3668ddd062ba9278a6
[08:33:53] <DaveStein> hey i have a question regarding a recent ticket. if there's a bug in 1.8.14 and it's fixed in 1.9, is the ticket invalid?
[08:34:01] <DaveStein> not sure when 1.9 is coming out
[08:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> the ticket's not invalid, but it'll likely be closed immediately as fixed
[08:38:12] <DaveStein> so it should be fixed in 1.8.15?
[08:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> not necessarily
[08:38:36] <DaveStein> okay so i guess since its invalid they are skipping over it until 1.9
[08:38:37] <DaveStein> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7564#comment:1
[08:38:57] <DaveStein> cause it's def fixed there
[08:40:01] <scott_gonzalez> that should be reopened and fixed
[08:40:13] <DaveStein> that's why you're my favorite ui dev haha
[08:40:32] <scott_gonzalez> haha

[08:42:19] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Slider: Fixed var statement. Fixes #7564 - alignValue Global Scope. - Scott González
[08:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[08:45:26] <DaveStein> that is awesome
[08:45:52] <scott_gonzalez> btw, here's where it was fixed in master: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/9626484dd5216f7597d4bb9680c95b9b210bac15/
[08:46:20] <scott_gonzalez> my guess is that it didn't merge cleanly into 1-8-stable, so I didn't bother fixing it there
[08:46:43] <DaveStein> ah cool
[08:47:08] <DaveStein> while noticing that i also noticed that Typekit leaves things in global scope too... guess ill need to talk to their devs ha
[08:47:49] <DaveStein> scope - what a bitch
[08:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:53:53] <scott_gonzalez> can anyone reproduce this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7549
[09:53:55] <scott_gonzalez> requires IE 9
[09:54:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not seeing any errors
[10:00:58] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i am also not able to reproduce
[10:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[11:53:31] <jzaefferer> kborchers: moved the menu keyboard handling discussion to the forum: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/menu-keyboard-handling
[11:54:32] <kborchers> jzaefferer: it was getting a little silly editing that page, thanks!
[14:02:51] <gnarf> hey kborchers - lots of pulls sitting there
[14:03:02] <gnarf> are there any that are easy to review / pull?
[14:03:06] <gnarf> I can take a look at em
[14:03:14] <gnarf> got an hour or so
[14:05:10] <kborchers> gnarf: i think 398 is pretty straight forward, though you need to be able to run the unit test to verify
[14:06:17] <gnarf> ps.. http://jqbug.com/ui/p398 :)
[14:06:48] <kborchers> huh, didn't know that one. thanks!
[14:07:11] <gnarf> without the p
[14:07:14] <gnarf> it goes to the bug #
[14:07:39] <gnarf> so
[14:07:41] <kborchers> nice. http://jqbug.com/ui/p397 is also pretty straight forward too
[14:07:45] <gnarf> question about this unit test
[14:07:53] <gnarf> before your previous commit on that one
[14:07:55] <kborchers> description should explain what is going on there
[14:08:02] <gnarf> was there a bug?
[14:08:52] <kborchers> no, it was tested by rwaldron and the unit test was posted on the wiki http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Menu
[14:08:58] <kborchers> in the comments
[14:12:45] <gnarf> kborchers: tabs on empty line #300 menu.js on pull 398 (i'll fix before i commit)
[14:12:48] <gnarf> just fyi
[14:13:25] <kborchers> shoot, thanks
[14:16:54] <gnarf> also PS
[14:16:54] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/p4QuTb
[14:16:54] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu: Passed the original event that causes a blur through collapseAll to blur, then trigger a blur on the menu. Fixes failing unit test provided by @rwaldron which has been included in this commit - kborchers
[14:17:03] <gnarf> you can @username in github commits
[14:18:09] <kborchers> yeah, i knew that but didn't think to do it
[14:18:28] <gnarf> kborchers: any chance pull 397 can be unit tested?
[14:22:01] <kborchers> hmmm, unit test or visual. visual might be better so you can see it in action no? do the keypresses yourself
[14:23:31] <kborchers> does this help? http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/JsFeq/
[14:23:41] <kborchers> gnarf ^^
[14:23:52] <gnarf> kborchers: thx, i mean unit too tho
[14:23:59] <gnarf> we should be able to simulate the keypresses
[14:24:06] <gnarf> and verify response in a unit
[14:26:09] <gnarf> autocomplete has some simulated key event examples
[14:26:42] <gnarf> it'd be nice to get some units for this behavior
[14:26:48] <gnarf> ensure non-breaking in future
[14:27:48] <kborchers> i'll have to work on that. not sure of the best way to test for things like page down but i'll figure it out.
[14:28:13] <gnarf> Setup a menu, simulate page down, make sure it goes where it should
[14:28:23] <gnarf> simulate home, make sure its where it should be
[14:28:26] <gnarf> simulate end
[14:28:28] <gnarf> simulate page up
[14:28:30] <gnarf> etc
[14:29:04] <kborchers> yeah, just need to think in different terms. not used to being able to assume a particular element will always be in the same spot. that makes sense, thanks
[14:30:15] <kborchers> thanks for looking at those. i'll work on those tests as soon as i can. gotta head out.
[14:41:05] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/287 this needs another opinion (not kborchers or mine) i think :)
[14:41:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez / jzaefferer / ajpiano ^^^ ?
[14:48:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: was waiting on your opinion to pull this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/301
[18:05:06] <gnarf> kborchers: re http://jqbug/ui/p328 can you look at it again - perhaps jsfiddle the broken case?
[18:06:04] <drew0> so if someone wants to jump into jQuery Grid, where do I find open bugs that need fixing?
[18:07:00] <kborchers> gnarf: will do. probably tomorrow though. wife is riding me to get off the computer so gotta quit soon. ;)
[18:08:40] <kborchers> drew0: see http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid#GettingInvolved
[18:14:28] <drewwells> ok thanks...
