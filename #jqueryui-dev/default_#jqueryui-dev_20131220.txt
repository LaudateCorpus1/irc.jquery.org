[03:53:32] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Good morning/afternoon :-)
[03:53:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom: morning
[03:54:38] <agcolom> Sorry missed your message yesterday. I was watching a film and then following the news about that ceiling that collapsed onto the spectators at a London Theatre... so wasn't on the computer...
[03:55:09] <uGoMobi> agcolom: no problem
[03:55:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, I saw the news about the Apollo theater :(
[03:55:41] <agcolom> must have been really scary! 
[03:55:51] <uGoMobi> yes for sure
[03:55:54] <agcolom> What is the latest with the release?
[03:56:37] <uGoMobi> we did release, but I wasn't able to get blog.jquerymobile.com up
[03:57:01] <uGoMobi> and there is a problem with the ThemeRoller
[03:57:26] <agcolom> right... I've seen someone complain about panels also (again not in a v nice way!)
[03:57:42] <uGoMobi> yup, I saw that
[03:57:53] <agcolom> I like https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/blob/0b35c1f547c39259decfc1e8e04a280c24c4c97b/pages/changelog/1.4.0.md 
[03:58:18] <agcolom> so should that be the new changelog for 1.4? (or maybe it is already?)
[03:58:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: arschmitz asked you and me to check it before we publish
[03:58:49] <agcolom> ok
[03:58:54] <agcolom> Will have a look
[03:59:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok thanks

[04:02:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Yes. First I thought we could have a short version with most important changes and the complete changelog next to each other
[04:03:03] <uGoMobi> but that was one when the complete changelog contained like 1500 changes
[04:03:23] <uGoMobi> s/was one when/was when/
[04:04:50] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, team, this branch is 3 years old. I'm planning to delete it unless someone says not to https://github.com/jquery/globalize/tree/jquery-global

[04:20:44] <agcolom> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_ arschmitz the api docs examples should use jQM 1.4
[04:21:14] <agcolom> currently seem to be using <script src="//code.jquery.com/mobile/git/jquery.mobile-git.min.js"></script> 
[04:21:49] <agcolom> just to check also, 1.4.0 is recommended with core 1.10.2?
[04:22:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, or 2.0.x
[04:22:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good point about the examples
[04:23:04] <agcolom> I'm happy to make the change but I'm not sure how to get the branch done... 
[04:23:18] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Are you around yet (maybe too early...?)

[04:24:07] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I remember _|Nix|_ said something about this, but I don't remember what exactly
[04:25:13] <uGoMobi> and I don't see a checklist anywhere
[04:27:44] <agcolom> we definitely need a checklist. scott_gonzalez has got one for UI and we would be a good base. We had one on which I added things that need to be done on releases and change of year... 
[04:27:55] <agcolom> And that change of year is coming soon....
[04:28:24] <uGoMobi> yeah
[04:28:34] <uGoMobi> we also need this for the new site
[04:33:53] <agcolom> uGoMobi: BTW I'll be on vacation from today, but should have access to the Internet from time to time when not traveling so should be able to do doc and site fixes/edits 
[04:34:01] <agcolom> and until the 8th Jan
[04:34:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, just saw your post in the Google group
[04:34:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: enjoy your vacation!
[04:39:04] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: delete the branch
[04:39:13] <rxaviers> ok
[04:39:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: there were also some PR's for the resources page if I am not mistaken

[04:39:56] <agcolom> yes... 
[04:40:26] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: What do you need help with?
[04:40:47] <agcolom> We need to create branches for all changes we make 
[04:41:08] <agcolom> and then all PRs will be checked by arschmitz
[04:41:42] <scott_gonzalez> So, from master:
[04:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout -b some-branch-name
[04:42:01] <scott_gonzalez> git push -u some-remote some-branch-name
[04:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> With everything going through PRs, I'd suggest pushing to your own fork instead of the main repo for your branches.
[04:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> Generally the way I set that up is fork the project on GitHub, then clone your fork.
[04:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> Once you've cloned it:
[04:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> git remote add upstream git@github.com:jquery/jquery-mobile.git
[04:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> Then you'll have two remotes: origin (your fork) and upstream (the main repo)
[04:43:34] <agcolom> (so I forget the first two commands?)
[04:43:49] <agcolom> I've not typed them yet
[04:43:50] <scott_gonzalez> If you do that, you'll need to start using `git pull upstream`.
[04:44:21] <agcolom> ok
[04:44:50] <scott_gonzalez> The first one (checkout -b) creates your local branch, you need to do that regardless of how your remotes are setup.
[04:45:11] <scott_gonzalez> The second one (push -u) is needed to push your local brach to the remote, regardless of how your remotes are setup.
[04:45:29] <agcolom> ok, so I do all that now...
[04:45:45] <agcolom> any naming convention for the branch?
[04:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> Anything sane.
[04:46:49] <agcolom> Can I keep using the same branch or should I have a branch per type of change? 
[04:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> No, different branch name every time.
[04:47:13] <agcolom> ok
[04:47:26] <scott_gonzalez> PRs are tied to branches.
[04:47:40] <agcolom> yes, that's what I was wondering
[04:48:24] <agcolom> in git push -u some-remote some-branch-name what is some-remote?
[04:48:44] <agcolom> so I've done git checkout -b exampleCleanup
[04:49:47] <scott_gonzalez> It depends on which remote you're pushing to.
[04:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm assuming right now you only have origin.
[04:50:01] <agcolom> api.jquerymobile.com is the repo
[04:50:02] <scott_gonzalez> Which is the main repo.
[04:50:14] <agcolom> how do I find out?
[04:50:18] <scott_gonzalez> git remote -v
[04:50:32] <agcolom> origin
[04:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> Which points at jquery/api.jquerymobile.com
[04:50:50] <agcolom> yes
[04:51:56] <scott_gonzalez> The naming of remotes is up to you. Whether you want origin to be your fork or the main repo.
[04:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> But either way, you'll need to add your fork as a remote.
[04:52:22] <scott_gonzalez> git remote add some-remote-name git@github.com:agcolom/api.jquerymobile.com.git
[04:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> some-remote-name should be "agcolom" if you want to keep origin pointing at the main repo.
[04:52:58] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd suggest changing origin to be your fork.
[04:53:16] <agcolom> ok, I'd rather go with how you do it.
[04:53:32] <scott_gonzalez> git remote set-url origin git@github.com:agcolom/api.jquerymobile.com.git
[04:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> git remote add upstream git@github.com:jquery/api.jquerymobile.com.git
[04:54:28] <agcolom> ok, so now I have upstream as the main repo?
[04:54:43] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[04:54:46] <agcolom> and origin as my one
[04:54:55] <scott_gonzalez> So to get upstream changes, you'll need to use `git pull upstream`
[04:55:07] <scott_gonzalez> Because now `git push` will push to your fork.
[04:55:18] <agcolom> ok
[04:55:28] <scott_gonzalez> So when you want to push a local branch to your fork, you'll `git push -u origin branch-name`
[04:55:34] <agcolom> (I'll keep a copy of this discussion!)
[04:55:47] <scott_gonzalez> -u tells git to track your local branch against the remote's branch.
[04:56:03] <scott_gonzalez> So you only need to include the -u the first time you push the branch.
[04:56:10] <agcolom> right ok
[04:56:22] <scott_gonzalez> After that, just `git push` should work.
[04:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> Because it knows which remote you're tracking for that branch.
[04:57:39] <agcolom> ok, do I need to do the github steps you mentioned above?
[04:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> You already have a fork.
[04:58:33] <agcolom> right, so you think I'm all setup?
[04:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's super out of date, but you have one.
[04:58:50] <agcolom> that's what I was thinking... 
[04:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> You'll want to `git push origin` to get it up to date.
[04:59:18] <agcolom> from the ExmapleCleanup branch?
[04:59:34] <agcolom> or should I switch back to master first?
[04:59:38] <scott_gonzalez> Well, your new branch will already be up to date.
[05:00:14] <scott_gonzalez> You can `git push origin master:master` from any branch right now.
[05:00:15] <agcolom> so I don't need to `git push origin`?
[05:00:30] <agcolom> ok,so that's what I need to do now
[05:00:32] <agcolom> right?
[05:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:00:48] <scott_gonzalez> It'll update the master branch on your fork, so it's not 2 years old.
[05:01:05] <agcolom> great.
[05:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's interesting :-P
[05:01:25] <scott_gonzalez> You must not be up-to-date.
[05:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> You're ~200 commits behind.
[05:01:54] <agcolom> even after that command?
[05:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[05:02:06] <scott_gonzalez> You must be behind locally.
[05:02:09] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout master
[05:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> git pull upstream
[05:03:33] <agcolom> seems to have done something good... bizarre because I started with a git pull --rebase 
[05:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> git push
[05:05:06] <agcolom> Everything up-to-date 
[05:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, your master branch is probably tracking upstream now.
[05:05:53] <scott_gonzalez> git push origin master
[05:06:11] <agcolom> Everything up-to-date
[05:06:53] <scott_gonzalez> what does `git log --pretty=%h -1` show?
[05:07:13] <agcolom> b4ea90a
[05:07:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's not upstream/master
[05:07:32] <agcolom> same as on github (2 months old)
[05:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> Try `git merge upstream/master`
[05:08:07] <agcolom> whoa.... that went crazy!!!
[05:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully that fast-forwarded.
[05:08:28] <scott_gonzalez> What does `git status` say?
[05:08:57] <agcolom> how is that possible? 
[05:09:01] <agcolom>  On branch master
[05:09:01] <agcolom> # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 174 commits.
[05:09:02] <agcolom> #
[05:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> Perfect.
[05:09:10] <agcolom> ah
[05:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> Because upstream is further ahead than origin.
[05:09:19] <agcolom> oh yes, origin is me
[05:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> Now `git push`
[05:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> It should fast forward your fork.
[05:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> perfect
[05:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> You're up-to-date now
[05:09:52] <agcolom> THANK YOU!!!!!
[05:09:54] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout ExampleBranch
[05:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> git rebase master
[05:10:47] <agcolom> ExampleBranch or the one I used before? (exampleCleanup)
[05:11:58] <agcolom> failed...
[05:12:17] <agcolom> I used exampleCleanup instead of ExampleBranch
[05:12:24] <agcolom> should I have used ExampleBranch?
[05:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> No, I meant exampleCleanup.
[05:13:17] <agcolom> so strange... there's a conflict!
[05:13:28] <agcolom> for entries/pageinit.xml
[05:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> Not that strange actually.
[05:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> Since there are almost 200 changes that you're dealing with.
[05:13:43] <agcolom> why, I thought I was up-to-date?
[05:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> You weren't.
[05:14:00] <agcolom> ohh :-(
[05:14:41] <agcolom> do you think this is the only conflict or there are more?
[05:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> It's impossible to tell until you finish the rebase.
[05:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> It's has to apply each commit individually.
[05:15:16] <scott_gonzalez> And it stops on every conflict.
[05:15:21] <agcolom> OMG!
[05:15:42] <agcolom> Is it not possible to start clean again?
[05:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, you can start clean again if you want.
[05:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> git rebase --abort
[05:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout master
[05:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> git branch -D exampleCleanup
[05:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout -b exampleCleanup
[05:16:24] <scott_gonzalez> That is:
[05:16:40] <scott_gonzalez> Abort the rebase, take me back to the state I was in before running `git rebase master`
[05:16:44] <scott_gonzalez> Switch to the master branch
[05:17:00] <agcolom> perfect!
[05:17:03] <scott_gonzalez> Delete the exampleCleanup branch (-D will delete unmerged branches, -d will only delete merged branches)
[05:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> Create a new branch from the current branch (master)
[05:17:38] <agcolom> Yes!!!! 
[05:17:49] <agcolom> do I need to git push now?
[05:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> You can if you want (git push -u origin exampleCleanup)
[05:19:19] <agcolom> oh... on github it says This branch is 0 commits ahead and 0 commits behind master
[05:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> Or you can wait until you're really to send the PR.
[05:19:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, because you haven't done anything in that branch yet.
[05:19:51] <agcolom> perfect!!!
[05:20:10] <agcolom> so I think it makes more sense to push (-u) when I have changes...
[05:20:28] <agcolom> Should be able to do this today hopefully... before the kids are back from school...
[05:21:01] <agcolom> Thank you SOOOOO MUCH!!!!!
[05:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> You're welcome.
[05:22:39] <agcolom> One more question: I may do these changes in stages... so I git push -u origin exampleCleanup first time
[05:22:44] <agcolom> then git push
[05:22:46] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:23:02] <agcolom> and when I'm done, how do I do the PR>
[05:23:03] <agcolom> ?
[05:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> There's a button on GitHub to create a PR when you're looking at a branch.
[05:23:34] <agcolom> right ok, perfect.
[05:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> That green button to the left of the branch dropdown.
[05:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> They also make it very obvious right after you push a branch.
[05:24:13] <scott_gonzalez> Once you have an open PR, if you need to make changes, you just do the commits and push.
[05:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> The PR automatically updates.
[05:24:24] <agcolom> fantastic!
[05:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> But nobody will be notified, so you'll need to leave a comment if you want someone to review again.
[05:24:34] <agcolom> sure
[05:24:57] <agcolom> but once the PR is accepted, then the branch disappears?
[05:25:33] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to delete the branch manually.
[05:25:52] <agcolom> using -d or -D?
[05:25:54] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go, schoole vent.
[05:26:08] <agcolom> ok, np thanks :-)
[05:52:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Ping!
[05:53:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pong
[05:53:37] <arschmitz> just wanted to let you know gnarf and i fixed the download builder and themeroller last night both were broken
[05:53:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok great
[05:54:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what did you fix for the ThemeRoller?
[05:54:23] <arschmitz> the kuler swatches were not loading at all
[05:54:52] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:55:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but did you deploy after making changes?
[05:55:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I added 1.4.0 but only pushed to the repo
[05:55:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the changes did not require a deploy
[05:55:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: because it is broken, it shouldn't be on the live site yet
[05:55:41] <arschmitz> they were infrastructure related nothing in the repo
[05:55:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[05:56:22] <arschmitz> kuler is an api and the new site did not have the api key in the enviroment
[05:57:00] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[05:57:04] <uGoMobi> didn't think of that
[05:57:16] <uGoMobi> there is a problem here https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/js/app.js#L120
[05:58:00] <arschmitz> huh id have to look into it more i have not done much with the theme roller code
[05:58:27] <uGoMobi> looks like it goes wrong with x.x.0 versions
[05:58:30] <arschmitz> i found this other issue because i was reviewing an apache config with gnarf to make sure we didnt need any of the stuff in it anymore
[05:58:41] <uGoMobi> yeah I understand
[05:59:03] <arschmitz> and there was an api key in there and then right after someone on #jquery complained about kuler swatches not working
[05:59:06] <uGoMobi> I wish _|Nix|_ was around because he wrote that code
[05:59:11] <arschmitz> so i was like hey bet we need that key!
[05:59:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: how can i reproduce the issue?
[05:59:44] <uGoMobi> I am trying to get the blog working
[06:00:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you have the TR working local?
[06:01:53] <arschmitz> probably lol i have the repo have not tried it recently lol
[06:02:44] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:03:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BTW - I just ordered a Nexus 5. Should be here tomorrow.
[06:03:31] <arschmitz> nice gnarf just ordered one too
[06:06:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: anyways, the problem with TR is that versionCompare return false here https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/js/app.js#L1369 while it should return true
[06:06:21] <uGoMobi> result is that wrong template is used
[06:07:16] <arschmitz> ok ill check it out
[06:07:22] <uGoMobi> thanks
[06:09:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so if im actually using themeroller how do i reproduce the error
[06:09:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: switch to version 1.4.0 (1.4.0-rc.1 will be loaded initially)
[06:10:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: then you see that swatch A has the right markup, but swatch B and C don't
[06:10:42] <arschmitz> ok thanks
[06:11:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the linked list for 1.4 does not have the arrow
[06:11:21] <arschmitz> not sure if thats related
[06:12:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good catch
[06:13:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think it's a mistake in markup somewhere
[06:13:08] <uGoMobi> indeed not related

[06:16:02] <arschmitz> agcolom: awesome ill check it shortly
[06:16:19] <arschmitz> agcolom: also thank you for catching that typo
[06:16:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: there are a bunch more things i noticed i have to fix but that was not one :)
[06:16:49] <agcolom> no pb :-) the new changelog looks v nice!
[06:17:03] <arschmitz> thank you it was an incredible amount of work
[06:17:14] <arschmitz> it started as a list of 3000 commits and issues
[06:17:19] <agcolom> I can imagine! 
[06:17:40] <agcolom> But it looks just right and inline with UI, so that's great work!
[06:17:53] <agcolom> well done ;-)
[06:19:01] <arschmitz> yeah i used ui script and format

[07:08:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i found the problem
[07:08:32] <arschmitz> that function you pointed out is completely broken
[07:08:34] <arschmitz> its suposed to allow < or <= type comparisons
[07:08:47] <arschmitz> and it is hardcoded to use < or > only 
[07:08:55] <uGoMobi> ah I see
[07:09:28] <uGoMobi> that explains why I didn't understand how it was working
[07:11:45] <arschmitz> im fixing it 
[07:13:16] <arschmitz> ok fixed :)

[07:31:03] <scott_gonzalez> -D will always work though.
[07:31:17] <agcolom> ok thanks :-)
[07:32:00] <sheppard> sorry about the PRs, my hub-fu is not quite up to par
[07:32:37] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: do you have a moment to help me with blog.jquerymobile.com?
[07:32:40] <sheppard> i was trying to switch the branch on an existing PR...
[07:32:58] <arschmitz> sheppard: no problem we will be going through and reviewing the PR's soon now
[07:33:12] <arschmitz> we have not been accepting any really for a little bit until after 1.4 final
[07:33:15] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: I do, but I can't get that site setup. Someone from infrastructure needs to do that.
[07:33:37] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ok
[07:33:38] <sheppard> yeah totally understandable
[07:33:42] <arschmitz> sheppard: so its a little backed up reviewing PR's 
[07:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> I can do the theme update once the site is up though.
[07:33:54] <sheppard> congrats to all on the release
[07:34:03] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: what should be my local setup for this?
[07:34:07] <arschmitz> sheppard: Thank you 
[07:34:15] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: where do I create the blog post content?
[07:34:19] <uGoMobi> sheppard: thanks!
[07:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: On the blog, which is now dead because of the site change.
[07:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: There is no local setup for blogs yet.
[07:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> They run off standalone installs.
[07:36:03] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[07:36:43] <uGoMobi> I will ask infra to setup the site first, maybe it becomes more clear to me after that
[07:38:53] <agcolom> arschmitz: I just spotted another thing that needed changing in the api docs, just I just pushed a new commit to the branch... hopefully the PR was updated.
[07:39:40] <arschmitz> agcolom: awesome thanks im just finishing fixing TR right now then i will look at the PR :)
[07:48:36] <agcolom> arschmitz: I've just seen more pbs so please do not accept the PR yet :-)
[07:48:57] <arschmitz> agcolom: ok no problem just let me know when you want me to look
[07:49:07] <agcolom> will do, thanks
[07:51:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: to fix the missing icon in the TR list item we only have to add the classes "ui-btn-icon-right ui-icon-carat-r" at two places
[07:51:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok
[07:51:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: while im in here im going to remove rc-1 also if thats ok
[07:52:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I only waited with removing it because 1.4.0 was broken
[07:53:44] <arschmitz> ok
[07:54:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think we should clean up the version list even more, but that can wait
[07:54:50] <uGoMobi> just the latest stable release of each version should do
[07:58:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can I point you at the two lines where we need to add those two classes so you can fix that as well?
[07:58:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure
[07:58:20] <uGoMobi> cool
[07:58:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/js/app.js#L1385
[07:58:52] <uGoMobi> and https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/jqm/1.4.0/preview.html#L37
[07:59:31] <uGoMobi> there you'll need to add classes "ui-btn-icon-right ui-icon-carat-r"
[08:10:40] <uGoMobi> agcolom: while you're at it.... can you fix this typo in the API docs package.json file https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/package.json#L6 ?
[08:10:51] <uGoMobi> homepage url says github.comom

[08:37:11] <uGoMobi> using the new changelog to complete it
[08:45:04] <agcolom> arschmitz: sorry one more pb spotted.... so PR is not quite ready yet ;-)
[08:45:15] <arschmitz> agcolom: no problem
[08:51:24] <agcolom> arschmitz: ok, hopefully this time it's ok ;-)
[08:57:31] <gseguin> uGoMobi: anything for me today?
[08:58:04] <uGoMobi> gseguin: no, I think we got it all covered now
[08:58:40] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6814 needs to land before the next release

[09:40:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: there used to be 3 swatches after init, now there is only one
[09:40:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: actually I am fine with that
[09:40:47] <arschmitz> huh?
[09:40:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we only have to test if things work when you import a theme
[09:41:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not sure what your talking about?
[09:44:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe it is because 1.4.0-rc.1 was still there
[09:45:06] <uGoMobi> I mean that when you start the TR you get to see only 1 blank swatch
[09:45:17] <uGoMobi> that used to be 3 (A, B, and C)
[09:45:33] <arschmitz> i see abc 
[09:48:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: all fine now
[09:48:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it was because it first loaded 1.4 RC 1 which was broken
[09:49:05] <arschmitz> ok
[09:49:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks good to go
[09:49:48] <arschmitz> ok
[09:50:09] <arschmitz> ill send it to staging
[10:06:59] <scott_gonzalez> Now that Mobile is doing PRs for everything, there's something you should all be aware of.
[10:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> If a PR has more than just 1 or 2 little issues that need to be fixed, you should just add new commits and squash later.
[10:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> Force pushing makes the conversation impossible to track.
[10:07:47] <scott_gonzalez> Where as new commits make it very easy to track.
[10:08:29] <arschmitz> i realized that about an hour ago :)
[10:08:36] <arschmitz> when i did that exactly
[10:09:11] <arschmitz> probably why your mentioning it :)

[10:31:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great, looks good
[10:36:46] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: is there a max number of commit a PR should have?
[10:37:28] <agcolom> For example today I thought I'd make one change, but then discovered more issues as I went along, and preferred to make one commit per type of pb
[10:37:54] <agcolom> so I ended up with about 8 I think, which I guess is ok?
[10:46:03] <scott_gonzalez> There's no max. It depends on what's being done.
[10:46:13] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: btw I know you don't like me using filenames in commit messages, but I did for package.json, because I couldn't see what else to use. Just "package" seemed weird! 
[10:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> But if you're making unrelated changes, they should be in separate PRs.
[10:46:24] <agcolom> (and could have been an entry itself)
[10:46:53] <agcolom> re: unrelated changes, they should be in separate PRs -> yes, I agree
[10:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> Use "Build" for stuff like that.
[10:47:11] <agcolom> ok. I'll know in future. Thansk
[10:47:15] <agcolom> Thanks 
[10:48:51] <agcolom> btw, I don't know who's designed the heart for the donation banner, but it looks really nice!
[10:54:33] <scott_gonzalez> Probably Isaac.

[14:23:45] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: From uGoMobi, 20h 38m ago: : Can you please take a look at the ThemeRoller? I added version 1.4 but the swatch B and C preview get the wrong markup. I think it has something to with versionCompare in app.js (I didn't deploy yet, so you have to pull and check local)
[14:24:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Can do.

[17:44:35] <gseguin> My PR just got scott_gonzalez'd
[17:44:45] <gseguin> I'm trying to keep up ;)
[17:45:04] <arschmitz> gseguin: not sure if you saw scotts comments earlier
[17:45:15] <arschmitz> but you should add commits then squash rather then force push
[17:45:25] <gseguin> didn't see that
[17:45:27] <gseguin> will do
[17:45:32] <arschmitz> so its easier to keep track of comments from reviewers and the conversation
[17:45:43] <arschmitz> gseguin: thanks!
[17:45:54] <gseguin> thank you for letting me know
[17:46:13] <arschmitz> gseguin: no problem he mentioned it because i did the same thing :)

[17:55:14] <gseguin> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/issues/34 
[17:55:25] <gseguin> I thought you fixed that
[17:56:28] <arschmitz> gseguin: i did but thats for 1.4 versions not 1.3
[17:56:37] <gseguin> hmm
[17:56:40] <gseguin> ok looking
[17:56:53] <arschmitz> we would have to do a new release to fix 1.3
[17:57:32] <arschmitz> gseguin: the old script looked for demos as a key in the url
[17:57:44] <gseguin> yup I remember that
[17:57:46] <arschmitz> and because they are now on demos.jquerymobile.com its totally busted
[17:58:11] <arschmitz> not sure how we can fix that aside from a 1.3.3
[18:04:23] <gseguin> arschmitz: can't we fix that in the demos repo even though it won't reflect the code from the repo?
[18:04:35] <gseguin> just for the sake of having a working demo
[18:04:43] <arschmitz> hmmm maybe just a sec
[18:13:15] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah i think thats fine scott said its fine to
[18:13:26] <arschmitz> do you want to work on a PR for it or want me to take care of it?
[18:48:55] <gseguin> arschmitz: I have no idea where to start looking
[18:49:04] <gseguin> arschmitz: it might be quicker if you do it
[18:49:09] <arschmitz> gseguin: no problem ill take care of it
[18:50:18] <gseguin> thanks
[19:01:10] <gseguin> arschmitz: it's probably the same for all the 1.3.x demos
[19:01:21] <arschmitz> gseguin: i would assume
[19:02:13] <gseguin> arschmitz: I've re-assigne the issue to you
