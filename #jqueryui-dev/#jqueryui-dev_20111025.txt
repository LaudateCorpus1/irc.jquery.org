[06:40:58] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I'm going insane
[06:41:14] <scott_gonzalez> I can reproduce this: http://jsfiddle.net/bA6AF/1
[06:41:24] <scott_gonzalez> but I can't reproduce it with http://jsfiddle.net/bA6AF/1/show/
[06:41:51] <kborchers> was this in FF
[06:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:43:56] <kborchers> hmmmm ... in FF7, they look properly aligned in both for me
[06:44:10] <scott_gonzalez> he said it varies based on window size
[06:45:08] <scott_gonzalez> actually, you can resize the window after they're positioned and see the problem
[06:45:16] <kborchers> ok, i see it off a little if i resize or if i zoom
[06:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> which is odd....
[06:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> must be something related to jsFiddle
[06:46:12] <scott_gonzalez> the position relative to the window shouldn't change as you resize the window
[06:47:48] <kborchers> right ... which i have verified here http://jsfiddle.net/bA6AF/2/ ... it is always the same even though it looks off
[06:51:55] <kborchers> and i also don't see that movement in /show so it must be a jsfiddle thing
[06:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> strange, I'll try to figure out what's going on
[06:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:09:03] <kborchers> anybody got a minute to give some feedback on this commit? https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/b66300724b4aeafd4327c519ebc36da1fb31ab74
[09:09:04] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by kborchers (3m, 23s ago): Menubar: Refactored _next, _prev, _right and _left into a single method called _move and then created next and previous methods that call _move. Very similar to how Menu handles keyboard interaction.
[09:09:31] <kborchers> i wanted to tackle that before i got Menu and Menubar handling tables
[09:09:48] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, gnarf ^^
[09:10:24] <gnarf> kborchers: only thing i don't like about it
[09:10:32] <gnarf> is that requirement for "event" in _move
[09:10:42] <gnarf> which makes .menubar( "next" ) blow up
[09:12:00] <gnarf> but it seems like a good cleanup/DRY
[09:12:38] <gnarf> how much of it is covered by the unit tests? :)
[09:12:51] <gnarf> (brb)
[09:14:19] <kborchers> hmmm, well considering there are no units for Menubar yet ...
[09:22:14] <gnarf> kborchers: thats where i would be concerned, perhaps you should write some? :)
[09:23:40] <kborchers> i do plan on writing some ... there were just a lot of todos and questions in the comments so wanted to try to get stuff straightened out there first
[09:25:15] <gnarf> fair enough
[10:41:18] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: sounds good, did you want it reviewed or just an ok on the idea?
[10:47:32] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: if you have any specific thoughts, that would be appreciated but i am changing some things based on gnarf's feedback so probably best to wait on any detailed review
[11:49:51] <scott_gonzalez> anyone have any bugs they want to fix that can land in 1-8-stable?
[11:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> I want to push 1.8.17 soon
[11:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> it's been two months!
[11:50:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: fractions in position :P
[11:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> hah
[11:50:41] <scott_gonzalez> I still can't figure out what causes the shift in jsFiddle
[11:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose I could create a local page that uses an iframe
[11:51:03] <scott_gonzalez> and see if that causes it
[11:51:10] <scott_gonzalez> seems unlikely
[11:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> might as well give it a try, I want this damn ticket closed
[11:52:05] <kborchers> yeah, i wouldn't think so ... that one is really strange ... i still don't think i've actually seen the issue outside of jsfiddle :\
[11:57:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: the div that contains that iframe has a height of 75%. if i remove that ... the grey div is off by a little (1px or less) with both 1.5.2 and 1.6.4 but it doesn't change with resize of the window so it might have to do with fractions on top of fractions making the calcs slightly off
[11:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> sweet
[11:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> I wrapped it in <div style="position: absolute; top: 25%; left: 25%">
[11:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> now it's reproducible as you resize the window
[11:59:57] <scott_gonzalez> ridiculous
[12:01:19] <kborchers> this is fun
[12:01:23] <kborchers> s/fun/stupid
[12:02:23] <gnarf> Heh
[12:02:41] <gnarf> I wish I had power... id laugh with you...
[12:04:11] <kborchers> no power??? dude, your power infra is crap up there in rockford
[12:04:36] <kborchers> seems like somebody sneezes and your power goes out
[12:05:03] <kborchers> even through all of those storms we had this year, i lost power once for about 30 mins
[12:05:07] * kborchers knock on wood
[12:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> jeez: http://gyazo.com/e890ef53b66e9709279baa3ca2ace417
[12:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> haha, that's like 50% forced updates
[12:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> hah, it's every branch besides master that I already had :-P
[12:07:41] <gnarf> Kborchers, u have underground lines I assume? I live in a neighboorhood with poles :)
[12:08:34] <kborchers> hmmm, good point. yes, my power is underground
[12:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, kborchers: your patch just changes which direction the box moves :-/
[12:09:06] <gnarf> Pretty sure this one was an automobile accident
[12:09:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: sweet :(
[12:10:57] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...this is dumb
[12:11:08] <scott_gonzalez> we shouldn't care about resizing the window
[12:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> this might actually be fixed
[12:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> let me check
[12:13:20] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....so I can't get it to have the wrong positioning on page load
[12:13:25] <scott_gonzalez> only when I resize the window after
[12:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> but I can get it to be positioned incorrectly in jsFiddle on page load
[12:14:19] <scott_gonzalez> so the 25% caused the resize bug on its own, but not the positioning bug :-/
[12:15:09] <kborchers> i guess the question then is, is there a positioning bug? other than on resize?
[12:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> in jsFiddle there is :-/
[12:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> unless jsFiddle does weird stuff that causes the page to reflow after window.onload
[12:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> nope, that's not it
[12:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> I put a 2s timeout and I can still reproduce it in jsFiddle
[12:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?!?
[12:30:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmmm, even if i do this http://jsfiddle.net/bA6AF/5/ it is positioned incorrectly. not sure of a way to fix that. seems like FF is just not putting it in the right place?
[12:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> but it's only in jsFiddle
[12:33:28] <kborchers> this hurts my head
[12:48:15] <scott_gonzalez> I give up
[12:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? it's the iframe
[12:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> <div style="position: absolute; top: 25%; left: 25%;">
[12:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> <iframe src="http://jsfiddle.net/bA6AF/1/show"></iframe>
[12:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> </div>
[12:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: confirmed that the patch doesn't help
[12:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, wtf is going on?
[12:52:51] <kborchers> damn
[12:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[12:54:34] <scott_gonzalez> actually it fixes it for 1.6.x
[12:54:36] <scott_gonzalez> but not for 1.5.x
[13:11:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: my guess is it has to do with fractional margin and/or padding.
[13:12:18] <kborchers> if i pull that example out of jsfiddle and create it locally, there is not position issue
[13:12:43] <kborchers> but if i add margin: 5.4px or padding: 5.4px to that wrapper div around the iframe, it jumps
[13:12:58] <kborchers> i'm iframing a local page
[13:13:09] <kborchers> i can't push it up anywhere from work though to show you
[13:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> I was able to reproduce it with the iframe
[13:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> does your patch fix it on your test page?
[13:21:05] <kborchers> haven't tried yet, hold on
[13:41:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i don't think it fixes it. it looks right in 1.6.4 and not 1.5.2 but 1.6.4 is after fraction stuff was fixed in core so i think that's why it works. looks like this patch does not help
[13:41:52] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, that's what I'm seeing too
[13:42:15] <scott_gonzalez> it does seem to fix a bug with 1.6.x though
[13:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> gotta go

[18:33:36] <gnarf> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui/commits/interactions
[18:33:43] <gnarf> if you were to use this as a new head
