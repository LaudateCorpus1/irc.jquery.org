[08:40:55] <jzaefferer> clarkbox scott_gonzalez: getneeded reports plenty browsers, but only two Chrome instances are connected: http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=getneeded http://swarm.jquery.org/
[08:41:22] <jzaefferer> I'd like to learn how to debug that to understand the TestSwarm-Browserstack integration, where would I start?
[08:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: getneeded = browsers that are not connected
[08:42:05] <jzaefferer> which means the browserstack cron job should now spin up clients, doesn't it?
[08:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> Whatever the id is for Chrome should not be in that list
[08:42:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yup.
[08:42:43] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack/blob/master/testswarm-browserstack.js#L7
[08:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> Anything that's in that list and in the getneeded list should be spun up.
[08:44:10] <jzaefferer> I found this, the cronjob:
[08:44:11] <jzaefferer> https://gist.github.com/e059b67e357a732cd9d4
[08:44:55] <jzaefferer> that doesn't seem to include anything about testswarm or browserstack
[08:45:16] <jzaefferer> the other two crontabs are empty
[08:45:27] <scott_gonzalez> Nope.
[08:45:38] <jzaefferer> so who's supposed to run that script?
[08:45:55] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it was cron.
[08:46:22] <jzaefferer> clarkbox? where's that cron job? or where is it supposed to be?

[08:57:26] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #2 on testswarm-browserstack, reported by jzaefferer (18.252s ago): Document cronjob
[08:58:38] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: If we need a place to track issues like that, then clarkbox's account is a bad place.
[08:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> I think the integration is actually bad as is anyway, it's not generalized.
[08:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> We should find out how infra wants to handle the actual codebase.
[08:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> We should clean up the existing code and keep that in clarkbox's account
[08:59:39] <scott_gonzalez> Then pull it into a repo on the jquery account which has our config.
[08:59:56] <scott_gonzalez> For example, that list of browsers should not live in a general integration module.
[09:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> Since the ids will be specific to a TestSwarm instance.
[09:01:11] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: yeah, though until we figure out where to put it, tracking there is better then nothing
[09:01:48] <jzaefferer> I think a lot depends on the puppet setup that gnarf wants to put in place, that should dictate where what should live
[09:11:03] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: despite the day early, did you fix the accordion animation in Firefox then?
[09:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't get it perfect, but I'm forcing the height now, so it looks good.
[10:38:55] <clarkbox> scott you there
[10:39:05] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer
[10:40:03] <clarkbox> im just on the way out the door, caught my name in the buffer. i was working on logging the workers yesterday so we can figure out how much time browserstack is running for us
[10:40:09] <clarkbox> i forgot to start it back up when i was done
[10:40:11] <clarkbox> sorry about that
[10:40:38] <clarkbox> and i agree, the integration is not as good as it can be. i just wrote it to get it done... not so much right
[10:40:49] <clarkbox> i can work on making things more abstracted and generalized
[10:43:36] <clarkbox> started back up.
[10:43:40] <clarkbox> will be back online later
