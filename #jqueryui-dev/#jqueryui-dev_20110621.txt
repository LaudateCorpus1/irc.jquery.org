[07:34:38] <gnarf> kborchers: do you have any unmerged branches with effects atm?
[07:35:55] <kborchers> u mean that use effects or have changed effects?
[07:35:55] <gnarf> just wanted to give you a heads up that I just pushed some major whitespace differences (like every line in every effect changed) last night, so might want to update them...
[07:36:04] <kborchers> oh, ok
[07:36:12] <kborchers> will do, thanks
[07:37:20] <kborchers> btw, i have seen a number of people sending commands to ask bot-t questions, is there a reference anywhere for those?
[07:38:56] <gnarf> the factoids?
[07:39:04] <kborchers> right
[07:39:11] <gnarf> well all the api stuff
[07:39:25] <gnarf> there used to be a list of factoids but the domain is down
[14:09:10] <kborchers> gnarf: here is what i was looking for http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_bot_commands
[14:09:49] <kborchers> also found factoids here though not sure how accurate or up to date it is http://jsbin.com/uruzo
