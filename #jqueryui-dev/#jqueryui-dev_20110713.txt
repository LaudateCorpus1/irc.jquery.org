[08:03:57] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menubar: Trigger select event after running all other methods. Allows the select-handler to destroy the widget without errors. - JoÌˆrn Zaefferer
[08:57:00] <jzaefferer> what is this? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/website-design#14737000002552461 "I like to hike with my dog at the weekend."??
[09:09:17] <jzaefferer> ajpiano, can you unmute #jquery-meeting / gimme ops?
[09:09:35] <ajpiano> sure
[09:09:46] <jzaefferer> or danheberden? though I'm pretty sure Dan is still hiking around airports...
[09:10:06] <ajpiano> i am gonna give you founder privs on that chan
[09:10:16] <ajpiano> so you can do whatever you need goin forward
[09:10:22] <jzaefferer> nice, thanks
[09:10:48] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: but you gotta auth with nickserv :/
[09:11:51] <jzaefferer> I'll look into that later
[09:17:42] <ajpiano> kk
[09:30:49] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i agree with the extension idea. still a bit of a noob in that area though so any other examples in UI i can go off of
[09:31:44] <jzaefferer> yeah, lemme look up Scott's extension repo
[09:32:01] <jzaefferer> overall that's still something we don't have good infrastructure for
[09:32:14] <jzaefferer> here: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions
[09:32:27] <kborchers> cool, thanks. i'll look at that
[09:33:17] <kborchers> do we know if anyone is working on flipfit? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5284 to address TODO 1 on Menu?
[09:33:19] <jzaefferer> so, apart from the menu-inputs, what are you currently working on?
[09:33:36] <jzaefferer> I don't know of anyone working on that
[09:33:42] <kborchers> just the other todos
[09:33:51] <kborchers> I can't reproduce #2 though
[09:34:01] <jzaefferer> that's an interesting task, would make position 100% more useful :-)
[09:35:39] <kborchers> i have a fix for todo 3 but thought it might be a little hacky. i just check if the new active item is a sibling of the current active item and remove the active class without the delay. what do you think?
[09:39:06] <kborchers> the extension stuff seems pretty straight forward. I'll close that pull and get started on the conversion
[09:42:44] <kborchers> jzaefferer: for todos 4 and 5, do you have a little more insight into what those should do? they weren't discussed at the last meeting from what i can remember
[09:45:20] <jzaefferer> in regards to flipfit: just asked @wilto to take a look at that, so that's taken for now :-)
[09:45:42] <jzaefferer> todo 3: sounds easy enough to try out, not sure what the actual implications would be - can you PR that so that we can review it?
[09:46:04] <kborchers> sure
[09:46:20] <jzaefferer> 4: basically create a demo that clones the navigation menu of amazon.com, but with keyboard support
[09:46:44] <kborchers> oh, ok that makes sense
[09:47:27] <jzaefferer> 5: just a simple demo where the position option is configured to have the submenus line up in one row, as in Visaul Design D3
[09:48:06] <jzaefferer> if you look at the comments: there's one by Rick Waldron, would need to verify if that is still valid
[09:48:21] <jzaefferer> markup alternatives is not important right now
[09:48:32] <jzaefferer> menu-inputs is wip anyway
[09:48:49] <jzaefferer> considering collapse/expand, we could rename closeAll to collapseAll
[09:49:12] <jzaefferer> no one commented on that, yet, what do you think?
[09:49:37] <jzaefferer> you don't have the access to delete comments right now, do you?
[09:50:01] <kborchers> i think that makes sense
[09:50:15] <jzaefferer> just bumped you to editor, do you see the "Delete" link now next to "reply"?
[09:50:17] <kborchers> no i don't which is why i have that blank one in there that i couldn't get rid of
[09:50:31] <kborchers> i do, thanks!
[09:50:37] <jzaefferer> great
[09:50:47] <jzaefferer> feel free to remove all old comments that aren't relevant anymore
[09:51:07] <jzaefferer> if valid, address and remove a day later or so, if invalid and a few days old, just remove
[09:51:21] <kborchers> ok, will do.
[09:52:14] <kborchers> did you see the comments from Dalia where we were talking about an autoCollapse option?
[09:52:22] <kborchers> any opinion?
[09:57:42] <kborchers> grabbing coffee, brb
[11:37:09] <kborchers> jzaefferer: here is the PR for todo 3 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/392
[11:37:20] <gnarf> bah
[11:37:25] <gnarf> boo insomnia
[11:37:39] <gnarf> doesn't seem I missed much in the meeting
[11:37:49] <kborchers> nope not much
[11:39:59] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i believe i have converted input menu to an extension. i have modified my visual test to reference the extension in my repo. should i PR that visual test so you can see it or how do you want to do that?
[11:41:10] <gnarf> kborchers: if you give jzaefferer a commit SHA he can check it out from your repo ;)
[11:41:19] <gnarf> or even just the name of your remote branch
[11:44:05] <kborchers> hmm, the repo just has the extension, then i made a visual test in a branch of ui separate from my repo. maybe i'll create the test in my extension repo and then give him a key. thanks gnarf
[11:44:40] <jzaefferer> kborchers, let's put the demo together with the extension in one repo
[11:44:53] <kborchers> will do
[11:45:11] <jzaefferer> eventually we'll have the plugin site to list extensions for each component...
[11:45:17] <jzaefferer> not quite there yet
[11:53:17] <kborchers> jzaefferer: here is my extension repo https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui-extensions  do you need anything else to review this?
[11:53:56] <jzaefferer> create a gh-pages branch and link to that in the repo description or readme or both
[11:54:08] <jzaefferer> that way people can take a look at the demo without having to clone etc.
[11:54:24] <kborchers> ok
[11:55:34] <jzaefferer> until we have the plugins site, we should just link to extensions in the description of a widget...
[11:57:12] <jzaefferer> Scott should add a gh-pages branch, too
[12:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> I have http://dev.nemikor.com/jquery-ui-extensions/
[12:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> should probably mention that in the repo
[12:03:20] <jzaefferer> yeah, that'll help
[12:04:07] <jzaefferer> or add gh-pages - before you push to master, just do "git checkout gh-pages; git merge master", then the regular git-push
[12:04:19] <jzaefferer> unless that site already pulls down content automatically
[13:23:50] <kborchers> jzaefferer: extension repo with gh-pages is set up https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui-extensions
[13:24:14] <kborchers> it is up to date as of our discussion about ARIA roles
[13:25:01] <kborchers> gh-pages is very simple for now but it works
[13:56:54] <jzaefferer> nice, if we find the time, I'll ask Hans to take a look at test it with JAWS
[13:57:58] <jzaefferer> one thing I just noticed on that demo page: should we add a escape-key handler to close open submenus, just as we handle the click-outside to close?
[13:58:16] <jzaefferer> seems unavoidable to keep repeating that logic :/
[13:58:53] <kborchers> i think that makes sense, will add
[13:59:18] <jzaefferer> makes me wonder if we should look at popup from scratch.. the current form-popup demo is kinda stupid, doesn't even work in latest JAWS...
[13:59:42] <kborchers> btw, i do see the icon issue from todo 2. only a FF issue from what i can tell. very strange
[14:05:02] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/o2Aex5
[14:05:02] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu: Remove the ui-state-active class from the siblings of the newly activated menu item without a delay to fix a bug where mouseover of a menu item directly adjacent to the active item would cause a 1 pixel jump due to both items having a class with a border (ui-state-active and ui-state-focus) - kborchers
[14:05:49] <jzaefferer> well, at least one of those issues is gone, thanks kborchers
[14:06:02] <jzaefferer> and yeah, the other is only happening in FF :/
[20:11:17] <gnarf> jzaefferer: happen to be lurking?
[20:17:09] <gnarf> hrm
