[07:42:32] <gnarf> hrm
[07:42:37] <gnarf> hey guys
[07:42:41] <gnarf> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[07:42:46] <gnarf> option dependency "cookie"
[07:42:52] <gnarf> https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie ?
[07:46:56] <jzaefferer> so silly that that is a jQuery plugin. Only depending on jQuery.extend, nothing else
[07:54:39] <gnarf> well the docs link to the plugins site which is pretty hard to use now ;)
[07:54:51] <gnarf> that github repo might be a better link
[07:54:59] <gnarf> it totally worked
[08:17:26] <jzaefferer> could update that on docs.jquery.com
[08:50:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: do you have edit privs on docs.jquery.com?
[08:50:48] <gnarf> maybe?
[08:50:53] <gnarf> so many logins
[08:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> http://docs.jquery.com/action/edit/UI/API/1.8/Tabs
[08:50:58] <gnarf> i don't remeber
[08:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> That's where the link comes from.
[08:51:23] <scott_gonzalez> Let me know if you can't log in and I'll update the link.
[08:51:44] <gnarf> yup, i can get it
[08:52:29] <gnarf> its locked though?
[08:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, probably because I have it open to get you the URL
[08:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> Try now.
[08:57:10] <gnarf> nope
[08:57:17] <gnarf> maybe "Gnarf" isn't an editor?
[08:58:53] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...I have no idea how the privs work on that site.
[08:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just update the link.
[08:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> We're getting rid of Mediawiki *soon* anyway.
[09:00:19] <scott_gonzalez> Updated. I think jqueryui.com auto-updates every 5 minutes or so.
