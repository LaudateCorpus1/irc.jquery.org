[01:12:11] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/371 interesting, i have no idea how to verify that
[01:12:11] <gnarf> :)
[07:07:16] <jzaefferer> for the record, UI and Grid meetings for Wednesday are cancelled
[07:07:27] <jzaefferer> if you've got something to discuss, just bring it up here
[08:40:42] <kborchers> anyone have any recommendations for a good, preferably free, IRC client for Mac? Just switched to a MBP over the weekend and struggling to find a good one.
[08:55:41] <kswedberg> kborchers: I just use Adium for both chat and IRC. Otherwise, Colloquy is nice.
[08:57:49] <kborchers> kswedberg: thanks, i'll check those out
[12:20:30] <gnarf> kborchers: Limechat
[12:20:56] <gnarf> came recommended by paul_irish, I kinda love it
[12:21:16] <kborchers> i'll check that out too. currently using colloquy and it's just ok
[12:21:20] <kborchers> thanks
[12:21:53] <jzaefferer> Adium's IRC support isn't great, but at least you can get away with just one client for various protocols
[12:22:14] <jzaefferer> found Colloquy pretty bad for a irc-only client
[12:23:23] <kborchers> yeah, that is what i'm finding as well. thanks again. will check out Limechat tonight
[12:25:27] <gnarf> colloquy was what i used before limechat
[12:25:31] <gnarf> i didn't like it
[12:27:54] <kborchers> do you have an iPhone/iPad? have you used Limechat for iOS? Currently using Colloquy for that and would like to replace as well
[12:31:39] <gnarf> dont there there is an ios limechat
[12:31:43] <gnarf> if there is, i haven't used it
[12:31:51] <gnarf> because i hate ios
[12:32:00] <gnarf> android is so much better :)
[12:32:46] <gnarf> (slight sarcasm there, but up until recently, iOS had like a million reasons I didn't like it, now it is just like 2 bigger ones)
[12:33:07] <kborchers> I agree. I have an iPad but my phone is Android
[12:34:05] * gnarf claps for paul_irish
[12:34:15] <gnarf> kborchers: was just asking bout irc clients for mac
[12:34:21] <gnarf> i pointed limechat his way
[12:34:42] <gnarf> you had tried some webapp one recently didn't you paul?
[12:34:54] <paul_irish> irccloud
[12:35:06] <paul_irish> very nice though it costs money or something
[12:35:12] <paul_irish> but i like it
[12:36:04] <kborchers> paul_irish: but if you were going to stick with a free client you would go with Limechat?
[12:45:33] <paul_irish> yz
[14:28:28] <rworth> I went with Linkinus caus I wanted to be just like ajpiano
[14:28:34] <rworth> not free, but worth it (for me)
[14:28:54] * rworth still wants to be just like ajpiano, that should not have been past tense
[14:29:31] <kborchers> rworth: heh, i'll take that into consideration. ;)
[15:02:32] <rworth> paul_irish: thought you might like this http://www.idangero.us/cs/

[15:03:21] <rworth> :)
[15:03:34] <rworth> css transforms with back compat to IE6
[15:04:47] <paul_irish> omggggg
[15:04:49] <rworth> obviously doesn't do the transforms in older browsers, but the effect works just the same
[15:04:54] <paul_irish> i am in love
[15:05:02] <rworth> https://twitter.com/#!/rworth/status/82931838263377921
[15:05:32] <rworth> so, you can pimp him on twitter. Hasn't actually release yet, says he wants to do some more testing, but says it will be MIT
[15:09:27] <gnarf> well, we can at least get him some followers ;)
[15:10:08] <paul_irish> rworth: his code is like.. very unfriendly
[15:10:22] <paul_irish> if you dont run it on his domain it $('body').html('')
[15:10:30] <paul_irish> weird.
[15:11:30] <rworth> iiinteresting
[15:11:41] <paul_irish> russians.
[15:11:45] <rworth> haha
[15:24:55] <gnarf> good demos tho :)
