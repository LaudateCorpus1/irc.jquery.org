[03:04:52] <rxaviers> guys, is there any jQuery method I can use as a .reduce()?
[03:06:16] <rxaviers> I wanna slice an object to get certain keys only. (equivalent to _.pick)

[05:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: No, and _.pick() is quite different from .reduce().
[05:19:41] <rxaviers> I know, but with reduce I could implement inline
[05:19:43] <rxaviers> but np
[05:19:48] <rxaviers> the implementation is quite simple

[08:11:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really concerned with not having CLA signatures for localizations.
[08:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be annoying when AUTHORS.txt and CLA signatures don't match up, but...
[08:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> At some point this will all get thrown out and then we can remove him from AUTHORS.txt :-P
[08:14:52] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: regarding Han's comment on selectmenu: "This makes me wonder if at this point it's even possible to have a correctly marked up ARIA based selected menu that is supported across all technologies." - what are we going to do about that?
[08:14:59] <jzaefferer> *Hans'
[08:16:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: there's also this and following: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/492#issuecomment-9994772 - which is actually a menu issue
[08:20:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Not sure what to do about the ARIA issues.
[08:21:40] <rxaviers> all, help? http://jsfiddle.net/4cUM5/7/
[08:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm starting to think we should add a 1.12 release.
[08:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> Bump selectmenu to 1.11, and start doing much smaller release cycles until we get to 2.0.
[08:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> We can discuss that at the meeting.
[08:24:44] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yeah, land yourself and close
[08:29:58] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/3c2acc322782cc08e575405f8123029342e33542#commitcomment-2257916
[08:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> We could parse style.cssText for the 3 values we care about.
[08:30:45] <scott_gonzalez> Should just be a split on ; and then searching for /^height:/, right?
[08:30:59] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: okay, I've added that to the agenda
[08:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Duh, we can just use .style.height, right?
[08:32:26] <scott_gonzalez> We only care about restoring inline styles here, but in the test we care that the computed values are the same.
[08:33:20] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: that maks sense.
[08:35:47] <rxaviers> solution found http://jsfiddle.net/4cUM5/8/
[08:35:47] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: my objection was with the tests goals
[08:36:21] <mikesherov> so, the test platform should make sure the COMPUTED STYLE is the same
[08:36:32] <mikesherov> except for cases where computed style sucks
[08:36:50] <mikesherov> but in general, that shouldn't be domEqual's responsibility
[08:37:13] <mikesherov> if you want to make sure height:auto is preserved, you right a test specifically for that
[08:37:35] <mikesherov> and the way to ensure that is using .style
[08:37:42] <jzaefferer> "We only care about restoring inline styles here, but in the test we care that the computed values are the same." - why the different care levels?
[08:37:59] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: because it's a faulty assumption
[08:38:19] <mikesherov> we care that WE leave the computed styles in the same state
[08:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> The end goal is the computed styles are the same.
[08:38:37] <mikesherov> the fact that computed style munges height:auto is a special case
[08:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> The reason we only care about inline styles in this case is because we're setting inline styles.
[08:38:44] <mikesherov> which we need to account for
[08:38:47] <mikesherov> right scott_gonzalez 
[08:38:48] <scott_gonzalez> So we need to restore the inline styles to what they were.
[08:38:52] <mikesherov> right
[08:39:00] <scott_gonzalez> We don't want to set inline styles on something that we didn't change.
[08:39:08] <mikesherov> we don't modify style sheets or add class styling
[08:39:27] <scott_gonzalez> And we don't want extraneous inline styles sitting around even if we did set them, if they weren't set by the user before creating the widget.
[08:39:31] <mikesherov> we only operate on inline styles, but that doesn't mean that's all we care about
[08:39:47] <mikesherov> right, sure
[08:40:22] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: maybe we need the same live-region hack for selectmenu as we implemented for autocomplete?
[08:40:27] <mikesherov> I was dreaming up core functionality yesterday, and one thing I thought of was ".saveStyle()" and ".restoreStyle()", which is better served for core
[08:40:44] <mikesherov> or even just make it a ui thing
[08:40:59] <mikesherov> store the style.cssText in a data attribute
[08:41:09] <mikesherov> and restore it afterwards and clear it out
[08:41:19] <mikesherov> that gaurantees we return it to the previous state
[08:41:36] <mikesherov> but we check that state by checking getComputedStyle

[08:42:07] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Well, the problem with operating on cssText as a whole is that we shouldn't revert user changes.
[08:42:23] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: that was my original point
[08:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> So something like .widget().css( "borderWidth", "10px" ).widget( "destroy" )
[08:42:33] <mikesherov> which is why I suggested the 3 individual properties
[08:42:36] <scott_gonzalez> right

[10:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> So this is interesting. I've noticed that since I fixed the font issue, Chrome is MUCH more responsive.
[10:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> Mysterious Chrome performance problem fixed :-)
[10:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm really glad too, because it was getting to the point where I was considering going back to Firefox.
[10:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8887#comment:4
[10:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> We could pull in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/master/jquery.color.svg-names.js as jquery.ui.effect-colors.js or something like that and list it in the download builder.
[10:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> When Rafael is around, we can find out how much work it would be to include it as an external file instead of pulling it into the /ui/ directory.
[10:29:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: if we decide to bundle it and eat the byte cost, i'd prefer to just merge the two back together i think
[10:29:35] <gnarf> i left them separate to not hurt the already massive byte impact that color was having
[10:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> Well, my thought is that a separate file gives the user the option of taking the hit or not.
[10:31:11] <gnarf> agree
[10:31:22] <scott_gonzalez> So the same reason that it's split it jquery-color, it'd be split in jquery-ui.
[10:31:28] <gnarf> yes
[10:31:37] <scott_gonzalez> And of course the default build will give them the full color list since deafult is all files.
[10:31:43] <gnarf> i did that to save ui the bytes, not another reason :)
[10:32:14] <scott_gonzalez> Well, saving color the bytes too, right?
[10:32:19] <scott_gonzalez> In case someone uses color on its own.
[10:32:31] <gnarf> i suppose... :)
[10:32:50] <gnarf> it does make it a bit bigger
[10:33:29] <gnarf> 3919 with svg colors vs 2740 without
[10:33:52] <gnarf> ~40% increase in code size
[10:34:09] <gnarf> but the number is so tiny, i'm not superbly worried about it
[10:34:43] <kborchers> fyi, safari 6 tests are caught up now
[10:34:54] <gnarf> kborchers: thanks for helping with that
[10:35:22] <gnarf> kborchers: throw some ie7's swarm's way?
[10:35:53] <kborchers> sure
[10:36:35] <kborchers> gnarf: you know if i'm going via browserstack, do i need to keep the browserstack window in focus or is the window being in focus on the vm enough?
[10:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: The window in the VM is enough.
[10:39:44] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, thanks
[10:40:02] <kborchers> just have to make sure browserstack doesn't time out :)
[10:49:36] <kborchers> IE7 hates the accordion tests
[10:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> Against jquery-git?
[10:50:00] <scott_gonzalez> Or against 1.8.3?
[10:50:03] <scott_gonzalez> s/3/2/
[10:50:14] <kborchers> 1.6, 1.7
[10:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the new style checks?
[10:50:39] <kborchers> not sure, locking up the browser
[10:50:55] <kborchers> trying to figure it out
[11:02:30] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: test hangs for a long time and then fails on the destroy test
[11:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> Comment out the style check in domEqual (inside testsuite.js).
[11:03:14] <kborchers> expects overflow: visible but gets overflow: scroll
[11:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, not sure where the overflow change comes from.
[11:03:43] <kborchers> let me try that ‚Ä¶ wasn't testing locally. just a sec
[11:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if the slowness is from the test or the output generation.
[11:04:07] <kborchers> i'm thinking output gen
[11:04:11] <kborchers> huge!
[11:11:13] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, much faster commented out but not sure if it's the test or the output gen based on that. still guessing output though
[11:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> Try modifying QUnit to not show the output.
[11:19:03] <kborchers> i hate you IE
[11:19:06] <kborchers> now it's passing
[11:19:09] <kborchers> so can't check
[11:19:27] <kborchers> seems faster if the output is not shown though
[11:21:13] <kborchers> i'll have to mess with it later but it seems like the output is the culprit
[11:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> I wanted to make the output more sane anyway.
[11:32:42] <agcolom> quick question... I tried to run grunt deploy on api.jquerymobile.com and I got: >> Error: socket hang up
[11:33:01] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[11:33:07] <scott_gonzalez> Is your server running?
[11:33:07] <agcolom> is there some server problem at the moment?
[11:33:20] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Are you trying to deploy to production?
[11:34:47] <agcolom> I'm just doing the usual thing... I've just done a git pull as well just in case I missed anything... and I'm getting some errors I've never had before... :-(
[11:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> So it's a problem on your computer.
[11:35:37] <agcolom> is it??
[11:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's what you're deploying to, right?
[11:35:58] <agcolom> no, I'm deploying ot the server
[11:36:01] <scott_gonzalez> what server?
[11:36:31] <agcolom> euh... wherever stage.api.jquerymobile.com is ;-) 
[11:36:58] <scott_gonzalez> You normally deploy to stage?
[11:37:03] <scott_gonzalez> Do you not have a local setup?
[11:37:11] <agcolom> yes to question 1.
[11:37:16] <agcolom> yes I think to question 2
[11:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> You should be deploying to your local machine for development.
[11:37:41] <agcolom> ok, so just grunt?
[11:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> What do you normally do to deploy?
[11:38:53] <agcolom> grunt deploy
[11:39:03] <agcolom> grunt worked fine. 
[11:39:11] <scott_gonzalez> Just `grunt` won't deploy.
[11:39:22] <scott_gonzalez> Your config.json points at stage?
[11:39:29] <agcolom> ??????
[11:39:51] <agcolom> I think someone must have made some changes while I was making some as well... maybe??
[11:40:01] <scott_gonzalez> In the root of your checkout, there's a file named config.json.
[11:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> What value does it have for url?
[11:40:42] <agcolom> "url": "stage.api.jquerymobile.com",
[11:41:05] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, you should change that to your local server.
[11:41:25] <agcolom> I don't think I have a local server.
[11:41:28] <scott_gonzalez> And of course you'll need to update the username and password.
[11:41:54] <agcolom> that's what I have done since we setup my computer back in summer last year
[11:42:01] <scott_gonzalez> oh boy
[11:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> Very soon that will become very bad.
[11:42:14] <agcolom> really?
[11:42:33] <scott_gonzalez> The only reason it's not very bad right now is because nobody else works on the mobile site.
[11:42:37] <agcolom> i just followed Richard's instruction by skype!
[11:42:41] <agcolom> yes
[11:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> Nobody should be deploying to stage for normal development.
[11:43:06] <agcolom> ok.
[11:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have a copy of web-base-template?
[11:46:18] <agcolom> yes
[11:46:54] <agcolom> I've just spotted a change... I've checked out my changes to do a pull and that worked ...]
[11:47:03] <agcolom> I just need to redo my changes.
[11:47:09] <agcolom> should be ok...
[11:47:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well we should still get you on a local server.
[11:47:49] <agcolom> I thought grunt made the changes local and grunt deploy deploys it/?
[11:48:14] <agcolom> ok... I have no idea how to do that (sorry!)
[11:48:15] <scott_gonzalez> No, the default task in grunt is to build the files.
[11:48:28] <agcolom> ok
[11:48:38] <scott_gonzalez> The readme on web-base-template walks through the steps: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template
[11:48:59] <agcolom> (you must be thinking why on earth did we get a girl on the team ;-) )
[11:51:07] <agcolom> ok, I need to get the 'prerequisites 1st...'
[11:51:39] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[11:52:40] <agcolom> (seriously, I don't think I have any web server on my computer!)
[11:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> What OS?
[11:53:16] <agcolom> Mac
[11:53:28] <agcolom> 10.6.8
[11:53:45] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/index.html
[11:53:57] <scott_gonzalez> That'll give you everything you need.
[11:54:12] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need MAMP PRO. You can use the free version.
[11:57:45] <agcolom> I've download it, but I'm not sure I'm getting things right... 
[12:00:37] <agcolom> it just goes round in circles... I get a zip, unzip it, and I get a zip.cpgz!
[12:03:55] <agcolom> right the downloaded file is 0kb! so something is wrong on my side... will try to figure it out and will let you know...
[12:11:27] <agcolom> ok, figured out what was wrong... got the files now... will try to install and let you know...
[12:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ping
[12:29:14] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I think I've installed MAMP successfully (well that's what it said)...
[12:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:34:35] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yo
[12:35:43] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Sanity check on https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/4a458cdc04c619ee38c5be1ca6e6ee6ad47644a8
[12:37:05] <nacin> holy crap
[12:38:07] <scott_gonzalez> The comment above is even more applicable now :-P
[12:38:30] <scott_gonzalez> I could've taken the easy way out and just dropped the path completely.
[12:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> But I figured I'd implement it properly.
[12:39:52] <scott_gonzalez> Of course this is now more advanced that what the rest of web-base-template can support.
[12:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> s/that/than/
[12:40:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's kinda annoying that I had to create the $site variable since list() complains if you try to assign to more vars than there are values.
[12:40:53] <nacin> you can use trim( parse_url( JQUERY_LIVE_SITE, PHP_URL_PATH ), '/' ) if you want to get the subdirectory
[12:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I'd still need to do the split anyway.
[12:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> Or use parse_url() without specificying the component so I can get the domain.
[12:45:58] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: if it works, I'd go with it for now
[12:46:08] <nacin> I'll have to clean up most of this juggling through web-base-template soon enough
[12:46:12] <nacin> but not today :)
[12:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:46:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> The problem I ran into was that api.jqueryui.com/1.8/ had no menu items.
[12:48:07] <nacin> yeah, sounds about right
[12:48:36] <nacin> should probably just shave off the path. do you need a specific menu for 1.8? not for now, certainly.
[12:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> No, we're actually falling all the way back to jqueryui.com for the menu.
[12:52:24] <scott_gonzalez> But I figured if I needed to fix it, I might as well make it work properly.
[13:14:45] <petro> hey scott_gonzalez, just an FYI since you were asking mikesherov earlier: yes, i'm working on refactoring the UI effects to use clip
[13:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:15:16] <petro> we've got a sneaky method that doesn't require wrapping :)
[13:18:31] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, I've got MAMP installed. I've managed to launch the Apache and MySql server :-)
[13:34:17] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I'll try to do the rest later this week... getting late and still have things to get ready for tomorrow... 
[13:34:33] <agcolom> (for work :-( )
[13:36:01] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: OK, let me know if you need any help.
[13:36:26] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: will do. Thanks very much for you help (once again :-) )
[13:36:43] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
