[14:32:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! I noticed you shim $.widget from inside the page widget. What if some widgets are loaded before page? Those won't be registered in the array. In the current build only loader is defined before page, so that's good. However, in a custom build others may well end up before page.
[14:32:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think the shim has to happen as early as possible so as to catch all widgets.
[19:55:31] <seanz> Good day, humans. I'm having issues with some widgets I wrote using jQuery UI - they don't seem to be initializing in IE.
[19:55:40] <seanz> Anyone here experienced similar issues?
[20:17:59] <seanz> Alright, never mind. I was using a console.debug statement. So my problem was completely unrelated to jQuery UI.
[20:18:02] <seanz> Bye.
