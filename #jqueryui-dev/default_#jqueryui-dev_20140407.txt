[02:03:07] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15qpi opened issue #7300: "unexpected end of input" when the jqm is embeded 02http://git.io/NMwkFg
[06:21:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do we support copying the library and pasting it in between <script> and </script>? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7300
[06:30:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think thats a dup i think i opened that same issue like a month or 2 ago
[06:31:10] <arschmitz> and i dont see why not 
[06:42:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. In that case, if we support pasting in the library, why is that throwing such an error? Our syntax should be perfectly suited for pasting inline.
[06:42:10] * _|Nix|_ is reproing
[06:42:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no you can have a script tag inside a script tag
[06:42:27] <arschmitz> even in quotes
[06:42:43] <arschmitz> so you need to just break the string
[06:42:56] <arschmitz> or escape it
[06:43:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: like "<scr" + "ipt>"
[06:44:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Now hold on just a cotton-pickin' minute! Aren't you supposed to do stuff like <![CDATA[ around your script in such cases?
[06:44:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: does not always work
[06:45:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: K, so this is /our/ responsibility? The reported error doesn't even occur in our code. It's in hashchange.js, which is not ourse.
[06:45:14] <_|Nix|_> ours.
[06:45:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well we use a fork of hashchange that we have already changed
[06:45:54] <_|Nix|_> Alright. I'll change it then.
[06:46:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont think you have access i think its gseguin fork
[06:46:38] <arschmitz> we use bower to install it in external now so its not actually "IN" the library
[06:46:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, it's one of those.
[06:47:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NP - I'll send G a PR.
[06:47:35] <agcolom> Hi :-) 
[06:47:40] <arschmitz> hi
[06:47:44] <agcolom> I have 3 simple PRs: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/295 
[06:47:55] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[06:47:58] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/294
[06:48:41] <agcolom> and this one, where someone needs to check I'm not saying anything crazy ;-) https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/293
[06:49:35] <agcolom> also, on https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/290, arschmitz I wanted to check something with you.. 
[06:49:37] <_|Nix|_> Argh! I'm now running on X86_64, and my text editor is only available as a binary for i686! Noooooo!
[06:50:21] <arschmitz> agcolom: sure what was your question?
[06:50:50] <agcolom> should we say 'navigate to another page' (or is 'navigate' ok on its own)?
[06:51:55] <arschmitz> i think either is actually ok
[06:52:53] <agcolom> ok, I tend to prefer 'navigate to another page'... so ok to make the change to that?
[06:53:11] <arschmitz> yes
[06:53:21] <agcolom> Thank you :-)
[06:56:24] <arschmitz> agcolom: i commented on all your others also
[06:56:28] <agcolom> arschmitz: many thanks :-)
[06:56:30] <_|Nix|_> Well, I'll be darned! All I had to do was install the .i686 libraries and it runs. Yaaaay!
[06:56:42] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yay ;-)
[06:57:09] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Would you be able to double check https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/293 please ?
[06:57:11] <arschmitz> agcolom: we should try and go through the rest too
[06:57:20] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes, definitely!
[06:57:24] <arschmitz> there are not that many and i bet we could go through them quick
[06:57:33] <agcolom> Do you have time now?
[06:57:36] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I'll read it.
[06:57:36] <arschmitz> yes
[06:57:42] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: thanks
[06:57:49] <agcolom> arschmitz: great!
[06:58:13] <agcolom> arschmitz: here: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues?state=open
[06:58:20] <agcolom> there are a few assigned to you
[07:00:43] <arschmitz> agcolom: ok looking through them now
[07:01:43] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/293/files#diff-c8698e44ba43d8df73306ee3281c9709L205 the default value for theme and contentTheme really is null. The idea is that, if it's null, the value is looked up from the parent collapsibleset if present, and otherwise it's inherited.
[07:01:47] <agcolom> arschmitz: great, thanks. I think there are 2 of _|Nix|_'s PR that need reviwing, and then he'll be able to land 6 ;-) some of which are associated with open issues, so that should close a few!
[07:02:16] <_|Nix|_> Yes, please! Have a look!

[07:08:54] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 148d8ed2a 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: Grid-layout: Minor typo fix...
[07:13:12] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: for the content and contentTheme defaults, I was wondering because of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/collapsible.js#L353-L364
[07:15:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's a good point. Computing the value for the options listed in that hash goes like this: Is it set on the widget? Then use that value. Otherwise, is there a collapsibleset parent? If so, and it has that option set, use that value. Otherwise, use the value shown in that hash.
[07:15:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, it's kind of inherited, but if you just have a collapsible on its own, then the values end up grabbed from that hash.
[07:15:59] <agcolom> right. 
[07:17:08] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I believe saying the default value is null is correct, however, because if you .collapsible( "option", "theme" ) it will return null.
[07:17:38] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The value of "inherit" is what's being used internally.
[07:18:01] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: I've checked what we say for the other options, and for example we say that default for collapsedIcon is plus, which is what is specified there also
[07:18:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, basically, the meaning of the null value in this case is "inherit from the parent collapsibleset, if any, otherwise just do straight up theme inheritance."
[07:18:59] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes, I see what you mean, it's like the default depends on the case
[07:19:09] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Oh, I see ... hmmm ... that's actually a quandry then, because that's not the value you will get from .collapsible( "option", "collapsedIcon" ).
[07:19:47] <arschmitz> agcolom: i think i commented on all the pr's
[07:19:47] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Maybe we need to explain this inheritance somewhere in the widget documentation, and refer to it from all the options that are affected by it.
[07:20:27] <agcolom> but if you put a collapsible with no set options, you will get inherit for content and plus for collapsedIcon
[07:20:48] <_|Nix|_> gseguin|away: https://github.com/gseguin/jquery-hashchange/pull/1
[07:21:10] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's what will appear on screen, but that's not the value you will receive if you ask for the value of the option.
[07:21:18] <agcolom> so This is what I would be inclined to put as default and then we can have something explaining the inheritance and say that in that case the defaults would be different?
[07:21:29] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: ok, I see...
[07:21:54] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Well, it seems we've already gone with documenting the effective value rather than the literal value.
[07:21:58] <agcolom> arschmitz: What is your view on this ^?
[07:22:24] <agcolom> Basically, we're not sure what to have in the docs for collapsible defaults
[07:22:33] <agcolom> http://api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible/#option-collapsedIcon
[07:23:02] <agcolom> we've gone by what is set here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/collapsible.js#L353-L364
[07:23:58] <agcolom> but _|Nix|_ is saying that this is not what would be returned if you ask the value of the option
[07:24:39] <agcolom> arschmitz: and thanks for the PR comments :-)
[07:24:59] <agcolom> OMG it feels so good to have a bit of time to do this ;-
[07:26:15] <_|Nix|_> I'm actually inclined to change the whole documentation to reflect the literal return values of the options and to always refer - or even include - a section explaining the inheritance mechanism.
[07:27:04] <_|Nix|_> ..otherwise devs might be inclined to "WTF?! It has a plus icon, but when I grab .collapsible( "option", "collapsedIcon" ) I get null ... WTF?!"
[07:28:12] <_|Nix|_> ... if we document that they will get null, then we can point them to the documentation and ask them to please read it carefully.
[07:30:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: agcolom: the defualt is the defualt its whatever its set to in the actual option declaration 
[07:31:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: agcolom: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/collapsible.js#L31-L43
[07:31:23] <jqcommit> [13api.jquerymobile.com] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #249: No documentation for isSameDomain() 02http://git.io/uHyD5w
[07:31:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it does not matter if it is whats actually returned
[07:32:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: agcolom: see http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/default_%23jquery-meeting_20140402.log.html
[07:32:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Got a timecode for ^
[07:32:58] <_|Nix|_> ?
[07:33:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its the very first thing with scott and i
[07:34:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You mean initialization should cause a change in the element's value?
[07:34:13] <_|Nix|_> I mean in the option's value?
[07:34:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not that it "should" but that it can and thats fine
[07:34:39] <arschmitz> even if its the default
[07:35:03] <_|Nix|_> OK. I think I get it.
[07:35:13] <arschmitz> in that case disabled is always true or false but the default is null but there is no case in which you will ever get null if you check the option
[07:35:28] <_|Nix|_> In the case of collapsible this wouldn't work, because it would break your ability to affect all collapsibles by modifying the option value of the collapsibleset.
[07:35:30] <arschmitz> but the defualt is still null
[07:35:40] <agcolom> ok, so we need to change all the defaults in the docs and say that in case of the defaults not being overridden by the user when setting the widget on the page, the look and feel of the widget will be changed when enhanced on the page?
[07:36:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: simply what i mean is the documented default should be what is actually defined in the options declaration
[07:36:22] <arschmitz> it does not matter if it will return that value or not
[07:36:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK. Gotcha.
[07:37:08] <arschmitz> so if the actuale defined value is the string "inherit" thats what should be documented
[07:37:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So we can keep things the way they are now - i.e., document the actual effective value that is reflected on the screen, and maybe explain that, although that may be the value, the return value of .collapsible( "option", optionName ) may not be that value because of inheritance.
[07:37:55] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK. I think we've established this.
[07:39:03] <jqcommit> [13api.jquerymobile.com] 15gabrielschulhof closed pull request #256: Navigation: Add documentation for $.mobile.path.isSameDomain (06master...06249-document-isSameDomain) 02http://git.io/0Mwrvg
[07:39:42] <agcolom> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ I'm confused... If we look at collapsedIcon, in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/collapsible.js#L31-L43 the default is null
[07:40:05] <arschmitz> agcolom: thats what it should be then
[07:40:31] <agcolom> ok, so we need to change all the defaults in the docs and say that in case of the defaults not being overridden by the user when setting the widget on the page, the look and feel of the widget will be changed when enhanced on the page?
[07:40:48] <arschmitz> wait but there is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/collapsible.js#L353-L364
[07:40:50] <arschmitz> this is weird
[07:41:22] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes, which is what we've be specifying as defaults for the moment
[07:42:04] <arschmitz> yeah this is weird because they should be null because those other values are applied later
[07:42:12] <arschmitz> but this is going to be confusing to people using it
[07:42:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You need to document the values from the bottom of collapsible.js, not from options: { ... }
[07:42:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because that's what will be effectively on the screen.
[07:42:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: which is wrong
[07:42:50] <agcolom> yes, so if we say null, they might be wondering why by not setting the option, they get a plus icon if we say the default is null
[07:43:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What is wrong?
[07:43:15] <arschmitz> because the default is NULL
[07:43:30] <agcolom> but then we override the default...
[07:43:31] <arschmitz> because thats whats defined in the widget
[07:44:04] <arschmitz> its no different then in the example of disabled and the button widget
[07:44:16] <arschmitz> where its changed in _geCreateOptions
[07:44:24] <arschmitz> you just made your own version of that
[07:44:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It is different, because I never assign anything to the actual option.
[07:45:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The value of the options is a hint that influences the computation by which the on-screen effect is established.
[07:45:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok then even more so it should be null
[07:45:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. That's my gut feeling too.
[07:46:17] <arschmitz> but this is not going to make any sense to people
[07:46:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It is, if we include a damned good explanation of the process.
[07:46:49] <arschmitz> that null is the default and that null means its checks $.mobile.collapsible.defaults
[07:46:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Which I can include via a xinclude snippet.
[07:47:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Believe me though, it /is/ convoluted.
[07:48:04] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Why don't you file an issue about updating the document default values for the collapsible options and assign it to me. I'll get on it as soon as I
[07:48:15] <_|Nix|_> 've merged all the +1-ed PRs.
[07:48:20] <agcolom> ok
[07:48:28] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: ok, thanks. 
[07:48:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I mean the "documented default values"
[07:48:54] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: will do, and I think we might need a warning box for the explanation
[07:49:13] <agcolom> so people do not miss it
