[08:31:05] <scott_gonzalez> at a repair shop getting an estimate for my car
[08:31:23] <kborchers> aahhhh
[08:42:31] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to grid: http://bit.ly/oe330j
[08:42:31] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Merge branch 'master' into grid - JoÌˆrn Zaefferer
[08:44:51] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I should be back online again in a few hours, would like to try and do a Skype call to talk about next steps for Menu and others; otherwise let's just chat tomorrow or Thursday
[08:52:18] <kborchers> jzaefferer: skype calls are hard for me during times when you're awake ... i don't have a mic on my work computer. IRC and wiki usually work better for me during the day (CST), though i know it is very inefficient
[08:56:33] <kborchers> i started playing with structures other than UL/LI and seem to have it working except for tables. do we want to allow tables as menu structures? things like tbody and thead make it messy and hard to accomodate
[08:57:17] <kborchers> i will be online most of the day so just ping me when you're back.
[12:35:25] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer: so i have been playing with structures other than ul/li for menu. it seems to work pretty well with any parent/child combination of elements now. question is using table. should we allow that? reason i ask is it messes with the parent/child stuff since table/tr would be the parent/child but then td's make a mess and then there is tbody, thead, tfoot that get in the way. thoughts?
[12:38:04] <jzaefferer> olla
[12:38:22] <kborchers> hey
[12:38:46] <jzaefferer> tables are probably not much of a concern; a good example of custom markup is the autocomplete on grooveshark.com, the one in the upper right corner (for some reason different then the main one, centered)
[12:43:06] <kborchers> ok, i'll take a look at how they do that, thanks
[12:43:18] <kborchers> did you want to chat about other menu stuff now?
[12:45:05] <jzaefferer> so, at about what time (hours from now) would you be available for a call?
[12:46:36] <kborchers> probably not another 4 or 5 hours. if i plan more in advance i can do a little earlier but the wife will kill me if i get home and keep working and don't help out with the baby ;)
[12:48:31] <kborchers> if we plan ahead (i.e. clear it with the wife), i can be available around 6 p.m. CST which is still pretty late for you right?
[13:02:40] <kborchers> jzaefferer: assuming by no response that none of that works for you? sorry for the limited flexibility, work isn't very accepting of "outside" projects nor flexible with my schedule or telecommuting so then when i get home, gotta have some family time.
[13:02:55] <kborchers> guess that's what i get for working for a government controlled institution
[13:06:05] <jzaefferer> sorry, still here but was wading through other mediums of communication
[13:06:26] <kborchers> no problem
[13:06:54] <jzaefferer> so yeah, those times are really late for me, that prolly won't work
[13:07:06] <jzaefferer> what about early mornings?
[13:07:10] <jzaefferer> any difference?
[13:09:20] <kborchers> hmmm, that could work with a little advanced planning. i could probably do an hour 1 morning around 6 a.m. CST
[13:09:50] <kborchers> then i would have to leave for work
[13:35:07] <jzaefferer> should try that some day
[13:35:37] <kborchers> or i could just get a new job ;)
[13:36:47] <jzaefferer> heh
[13:36:47] <jzaefferer> maybe
[13:37:09] <jzaefferer> but then you may end up doing something fun for work, having less time for jQuery UI ;)
[13:37:45] <kborchers> or i could get a job like scott_gonzalez where i get paid to work on jQuery UI ;p
[13:38:44] <jzaefferer> yeah, that's even better
[13:39:02] <jzaefferer> so, let's see, Menu TODOs, if that works for you now?
[13:39:14] <kborchers> sure
[13:41:34] <kborchers> #1 was just merged :D  any way for me to see how it's doing in testswarm?
[13:41:51] <jzaefferer> yeah: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/
[13:42:22] <jzaefferer> position looks good, position_deprecated not so much
[13:42:29] <jzaefferer> I never looked at that one :/
[13:42:42] <jzaefferer> so maybe that's something you can take a look at?
[13:42:50] <kborchers> ooh, me neither. will do
[13:44:36] <kborchers> i had to modify a bunch of tests in position so that probably has to happen in deprecated too. mostly having to do with it thinking it should flip when it shouldn't
[13:44:59] <jzaefferer> the builtin autocollapse seems to work quite well, that way actually interacting with a submenu is pretty easy, but it won't stay open if you just hover over the parent
[13:45:21] <kborchers> want me to issue a pull for that?
[13:51:52] <kborchers> looking at those failed tests in deprecated, it seems to be a bunch of off by 1 stuff. hmmmm, i'll have to look into it.
[14:11:55] <kborchers> jzaefferer: you still there?
[14:23:56] <kborchers> ?tell jzaefferer wondering what your thoughts on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/419 are. That and adding the missing divs for the fraction test to position_deprecated.html seems to fix most if not all of those errors.
[14:23:57] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[19:37:48] <kborchers> ?tell jzaefferer i did some digging and the grooveshark autocomplete uses UL/LI so not an example of other structures :(
[19:37:48] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
