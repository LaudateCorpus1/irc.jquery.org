[07:26:31] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Ruffio opened issue #7835: Remove code that supports jQuery <1.8 (including 1.6.1 and 1.6.2) 02http://git.io/KQ8eyQ
[08:00:32] <jperrault> question about test cases.  I know that jsfiddle is a popular place to share test cases for pre-bug fix, but it makes it tough to share the post-fix jquery-ui code for purposes of validation.  Is there a preferred way to share a fix for validation?
[08:13:58] <arschmitz> jperrault: for us to validate?
[08:14:29] <jperrault> yes, the committer.  to make their job a bit easier.
[08:14:42] <arschmitz> jperrault: a pr
[08:15:56] <jperrault> so you then, what, manually pull each PR into into your local environment and try it out?
[08:15:59] <arschmitz> jperrault: we have git aliases we use that make it pretty easy
[08:16:10] <arschmitz> jperrault: like git pru prnumber
[08:16:30] <arschmitz> will make a local branch name pr/number and checkitout
[08:16:49] <arschmitz> so its very easy to pull it local to run test and check things
[08:17:12] <jperrault> arschmitz: thanks.
[08:17:51] <arschmitz> jperrault: no problem https://github.com/gnarf/.dotfiles is where we get them if your curious
[08:19:58] <jperrault> I've noticed some bugs work in the demo code, and the person submitting the bug includes a jsfiddle link to highlight the specific problem.  In that case, a simple PR pull won't necessarily allow you to validate, so I was wondering what you do in those cases.
[08:20:59] <arschmitz> jperrault: well there are a few things we could do depending
[08:21:14] <arschmitz> jperrault: we could change the fiddle to point at a local build
[08:21:26] <arschmitz> jperrault: or we could copy the fiddle locally and test it
[08:21:37] <arschmitz> jperrault: but the best way is to write a test for it
[08:21:44] <arschmitz> which pr's should include anyway
[08:26:29] <tj_vantoll> jperrault: I often use rawgit to test within jsFiddle/jsBin itself. For example I used  http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/zL8uj2em/ to confirm https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1380 addresses the bug.
[08:26:29] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[08:26:34] <tj_vantoll> `read
[08:26:34] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: From scott_gonzalez, 3d 3h ago: I updated my comment to actually answer your question :-P https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/236#issuecomment-62138078
[08:28:39] <jperrault> tj_vantoll: thanks.  For example, I'm about to (resubmit) a PR for http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9264.  I'm not sure if it can be validated through an automated test (e.g. as part of the /test directory...so how/where would I attach the test case?
[08:29:58] <tj_vantoll> There's a visual folder in the repo to handle situations that cannot be unit tested. That being said we try to avoid using those unless it's absolutely necessary, as we only periodically peruse that folder.

[12:42:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Ping!
[12:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz jperrault: For future reference, the canonical location of that information is http://contribute.jquery.org/repo-maintainers-guide/
[12:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> We don't link to that from anywhere because it's just for maintainers, but the page shows up in search results, so it's pretty easy to find if you know which site to look in.
[12:50:40] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: thanks.  I don't think http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9264 can be tested via automated means...so I'm putting two files into the  test/visual/accordion folder.  One is the jsfiddle html associated with the bug report, and the other is the accordion demo page modified to work within the visual directory.
[12:51:21] <jperrault> if that isn't the right way to go, now is the time to save yourself some github PR comments... :-)
[12:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> Why does this need two pages?
[12:52:35] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: you've told me in the past to test against the demo pages, but in this case the bug arises when the accordion width is constrained, which doesn't happen in the normal demo
[12:53:18] <jperrault> I'd prefer zero, of course, but this seems to be a visual issue.
[12:53:21] <scott_gonzalez> What's the differnce between the two test pages you're creating?
[12:55:48] <jperrault> the jsfiddle page wraps the accordion inside an addition div, which I'm not sure is significant.  Otherwise I just added .wrapperAccordion { width: 300px } to the demo page.
[12:56:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'd definitely limit that to a single new page.
[12:56:40] <jperrault> vg.  The end goal to to give you a valid test case.
[12:56:54] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:56:55] <jperrault> * to to / is to
[12:56:59] <jperrault> thanks
[12:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> no problme
[13:29:56] <jperrault> hmmm.I ran grunt and it passed, but Travis doesn't like what I committed...
[13:35:11] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Weird. I started a rerun.
[13:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> If it fails again, I'll pull it locally and see if it's passing for me.
[13:36:49] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: i did a "git pull upstream master", and there were changes to accordion since yesterday, so I did a stash/pull/pop...perhaps that has something to do with it.
[13:57:02] <WeeJeWel> #jquery
[13:57:07] <WeeJeWel> whoops
[13:57:50] <WeeJeWel> Question: Can I prevent a sortable from even accepting elements before drop? So when hovering, it does not even indicate it can be dropped? (Like droppable's accept)
[14:18:28] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: logging for the day, I'll check the PR for comments, thanks!
[14:56:12] <agcolom> arschmitz: gabriel_schulhof cgack: any one of you around for a pagecontainerbeforeshow question?
[15:06:23] <cgack> agcolom: I'm around. I'll do my best to answer
[15:06:40] <agcolom> Hi Cory :-)
[15:07:18] <agcolom> So here's my question: I'm looking at the best way to use pagecontainerbeforeshow
[15:08:00] <agcolom> so we have 2 pages #page1 and #page2 and I want to do something when we go to page2
[15:08:29] <agcolom> in the past, we used $( "#page2" ).on( "pagebeforeshow", function() {
[15:08:37] <agcolom> do something...
[15:09:03] <agcolom> so should I go $( "document" ).on( "pagecontainerbeforeshow", function() { 
[15:09:13] <agcolom> sorry,
[15:09:31] <agcolom> $( "document" ).on( "pagecontainerbeforeshow", function( event, ui ) {
[15:10:01] <agcolom> and then track the page we're changing to?
[15:10:08] <agcolom> or is there a neater way?
[15:10:17] <agcolom> that's it :-)
[15:10:24] <scott_gonzalez> That's the correct way.
[15:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> But no quotes on document.
[15:10:36] <agcolom> oh yes ;-)
[15:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> And you can do `ui.toPage.is( "#page2" )`
[15:11:11] <agcolom> oh, I didn't know that
[15:11:14] <agcolom> Thanks!
[15:40:11] <Omar-> agcolom http://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/03/26/jquery-mobile-page-events/
[15:41:54] <agcolom> Omar-: Thanks :-) yes, I was looking at it as well. v nice page!
[15:43:36] <Omar-> agcolom thanks :) I need to update it though
[15:43:44] <agcolom> Omar-: I can't believe I didn't know about your site!
[15:44:07] <Omar-> I should include ".toPage" to all events except for pagecreate and pagebeforecreate
[15:44:50] <agcolom> yes :-)
[15:45:39] <Omar-> agcolom enjoy! :)
[15:46:10] <agcolom> I will! Thanks!
[15:46:34] <Omar-> agcolom if you have any question, leave a comment and I'll answer asap :)
[15:46:42] <Omar-> answer it*
[15:47:04] <agcolom> Thanks a lot. Time to get some sleep for me... 
[15:47:17] <Omar-> agcolom goodnight!
[15:47:25] <agcolom> Thanks. 
[15:51:29] <Omar-> goodnight everyone!
