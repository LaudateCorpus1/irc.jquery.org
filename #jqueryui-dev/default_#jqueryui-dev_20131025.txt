[02:07:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6655 ... I guess we apply that in 1.4.1, right?
[02:07:06] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Pull request #6655 by allsteady (2h 29m ago):  A user should not change  the value of clearBtn option in runtime.
[02:07:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Having the ability to add/remove the clear button is not exactly essential, right?

[02:08:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, has to wait until 1.4.1
[02:08:17] <_|Nix|_> Oh no ... this last one from frequent sounds worse ...
[02:11:59] <_|Nix|_> However, I think I may have a workaround for him ... lemme check that ...

[02:35:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think about frequent's problem? He's creating pages dynamically, and expects them to be removed automatically. I'm a bit cautious about adding code that auto-removes a page that was not explicitly loaded via AJAX.
[02:36:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: My feeling is that we should close the issue and the pull request, because he can turn on auto-removal for his own use case with $.mobile.document.on( "pagecreate", "#setup" /* the ID of the dynamically created page */, function() { $( this ).page( "bindRemove" ); } );
[02:37:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, basically, I think this is use-case specific and so shouldn't be in the library.
[02:37:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure
[02:38:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I
[02:38:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we promise to remove pages from the DOM after you navigate away from them (except initial page)
[02:38:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's normally true, but if you create the page yourself ...
[02:38:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, you know what, you may be right.
[02:38:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we don't say anything about how that page should be created
[02:38:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We have option domCache, right?
[02:39:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was about to mention that
[02:40:06] <_|Nix|_> OK ... bindRemove() does nothing if domCache is on ...
[02:40:14] <_|Nix|_> So, frequent's PR should actually be OK.
[02:40:52] <_|Nix|_> I'm just worried that this may result in bindRemove() being called multiple times on the same page.
[02:41:23] <_|Nix|_> Maybe we should set a flag on the page to make sure that, if bindRemove() has already been called on it, it is not called again.
[02:41:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I haven't looked at the PR yet
[02:41:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you think this issue is a regression or same problem in 1.3?
[02:43:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno ... I can check if it's a regression.
[02:45:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure about that PR

[02:47:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it looks like a workaround to me
[02:53:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not a regression.
[02:53:36] <_|Nix|_> frequent: We're just discussing your PR.
[02:53:43] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hey
[02:53:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok thanks for checking
[02:53:49] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[02:53:57] <frequent> uGoMobi: hi
[02:54:04] <_|Nix|_> frequent: We weren't removing dynamically injected pages in 1.3.x either, so it's not a regression ...
[02:54:07] <frequent> sorry for not providing a jsbin. Kind of hectic here
[02:54:17] <_|Nix|_> frequent: NP. I got one.
[02:54:23] <_|Nix|_> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/704
[02:54:29] <frequent> _|Nix|_: cool. thx
[02:54:39] <_|Nix|_> It's on 1.3.2 right now, but that's because I was checking for the regression.
[02:54:48] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I wasn't sure, whether it was possible in 1.3.x
[02:55:38] <frequent> _|Nix|_: but still thought there should be a "flag" to bind to or a way to add the pages into the regular JQM handling
[02:56:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: about the solution... we call the bindRemove method of the page widget in the _include method of pagecontainer widget
[02:56:15] <_|Nix|_> frequent: The thing is, we have the page's domCache option.
[02:56:27] <_|Nix|_> frequent: That's normally set to true.
[02:56:31] <_|Nix|_> I mean false
[02:56:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is _include not called when you dynamically adding a page?
[02:56:43] <_|Nix|_> No.
[02:56:50] <frequent> uGoMobi: no
[02:56:53] <_|Nix|_> ... because the page is already in the DOM.
[02:57:25] <uGoMobi> ok
[02:57:35] <frequent> _|Nix|_: but then it will also not trigger a pagehide, won't it?
[02:58:25] <frequent> _|Nix|_: because ... page.bind( "pagehide.remove" ... is set inside bindRemove which is called on _include
[02:58:26] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yes it will. pagehide is triggered on all pages.
[02:58:48] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok. need to check again
[02:59:14] <_|Nix|_> frequent: The pagehide.remove handler won't be triggered, of course, because it is not attached, but the pagehide event will always be triggered.
[03:00:15] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok. pagehide is there ... 
[03:01:02] <frequent> _|Nix|_: then 1.3.x behavior would be to listen for pagehide and manually remove if data-external-page = true or data-dom-cache=false?
[03:03:49] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Well, you can always $.mobile.document.on( "pagecreate", "#setup", function() { $( this ).page( "bindRemove" ); } );
[03:05:30] <frequent> _|Nix|_: good point.
[03:06:12] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Well, actually, that doesn't seem to work. Lemme check why.
[03:06:33] <frequent> _|Nix|_: :-)
[03:11:26] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I think you have to mark the page as external with data-external-page="true"
[03:11:35] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Otherwise it won't attach the handler.
[03:12:22] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yep. That's it.
[03:16:18] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok. thx for investigating :-)
[03:16:26] <_|Nix|_> frequent: So, basically, you could argue that, in your case, the library was behaving as expected. However, the but still exists, because if you mark your page as external, it still won't get removed.
[03:16:37] <_|Nix|_> the bug, not the but
[03:16:38] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.7.x core build #449: STILL UNSTABLE in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.7.x%20core/449/
[03:17:00] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok
[03:17:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can we mark the issue and the PR as 1.4.1?
[03:17:32] <frequent> _|Nix|_: (and I had marked the pages as external)
[03:17:44] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Oh, OK. Then definite bug :)
[03:17:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[03:18:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we should go over it with arschmitz as well, after 1.4.0.
[03:18:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah for sure
[03:18:31] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. cool for me.
[03:23:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You know, come to think of it, pagecontainer should not actually be doing any .page( "bindRemove" ) -ing.
[03:24:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: page should be doing it during _create90
[03:24:09] <_|Nix|_> _create()
[03:25:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That way, pagecontainer doesn't need to worry about whether pages disappear or not. It's scope will then shrink to simply finding/loading/transitioning pages.
[03:25:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and the decision as to whether a page disappears from the DOM is entirely inside the page.
[03:25:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was thinking about that too, but on the other hand, it is part of AJAX navigation
[03:26:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, it's not.
[03:26:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Page retrieval and instantiation is part of AJAX nav.
[03:26:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What happens to the page after it's hidden is irrelevant, because the nav process has already moved on to the next page.
[03:27:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course, it's easy to say that, but we'll have to make sure that no references to the old page remain anywhere.
[03:27:36] <uGoMobi> right
[03:30:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I am in favor of calling bindRemove only at one place, instead of the two calls in frequent his PR
[03:30:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can look into if that call should be in create in the page widget or should stay in pagecontainer widget
[03:31:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Think about it. Both bindRemove() calls are preceded by this._enhance(), which is basically .page(). So, we could easily move those calls into page's _create() method.
[03:32:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that makes sense
[03:33:23] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I need to eat something or I'll keel over ... BRB ...
[03:40:17] <_|Nix|_> I haven't keeled over, so that's beneficial.

[05:42:02] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_ uGoMobi:
[05:53:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:54:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lotsa meat coming in via the issues ... not many, but nice ones.
[05:54:52] <arschmitz> im not sure i agree about removing pages
[05:55:12] <arschmitz> its just like the enhanced option
[05:55:39] <arschmitz> if you use it and call destroy we dont revert the markup
[05:55:47] <arschmitz> and if you insert the page your self we dont remove it
[05:56:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's as good a way to go as any.
[05:56:24] <arschmitz> and its always been this way its not new
[05:56:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But what about if we stop calling bindRemove() from pagecontainer() altogether, and let the page handle it internally?
[05:56:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is that a can of worms leading to where the hell did the page go debugging?
[05:56:54] <arschmitz> i think page container loads the page
[05:57:05] <arschmitz> so it should remove it
[05:57:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Yeah ... this is the safest course of action ...
[05:57:45] <arschmitz> seems like it would be weird for a widget to remove it self
[05:58:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The thing is, domCache is a page option, but it doesn't really affect page behaviour.
[05:59:03] <arschmitz> it should not be an option
[05:59:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... Other than to influence the behaviour of bindRemove
[05:59:08] <arschmitz> it should be a prop
[05:59:29] <arschmitz> like a data-attribute
[05:59:31] <arschmitz> on page
[05:59:36] <arschmitz> but not an option on page widget
[06:00:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then we should deprecate data-external-page and just use data-dom-cache ...
[06:00:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But wait, no ... we don't wanna drop internal pages.
[06:00:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i want to review the whole nav api 
[06:00:43] <arschmitz> maybe for 1.5
[06:00:55] <arschmitz> i think the there are options that are confusing and dont make sense
[06:01:00] <arschmitz> events in the wrong places
[06:01:19] <arschmitz> all sorts of things that should be cleaned up
[06:01:39] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and i have already started looking at it some but it had to be wait until after 1.4

[07:14:48] <frequent> if I inject a dynamically generated page with data-enhanced="true"

[09:41:20] <agcolom> and if I launch Firefox, I get this message: Want an Android browser as smart as your desktop browser? Install Firefox for Android!
[09:41:34] <agcolom> and that message wasn't here yesterday...
[09:43:48] <agcolom> seems that they had an event today... oh well. Looks like I got this wrong ;-)
[09:54:43] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz _|Nix|_ I think we have a bug with panels on RC1... 
[10:03:22] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15agcolom opened issue #6663: Scroll on an open panel and the panel disappears and cannot be reopened in RC1  02http://git.io/jJN9EQ
[10:13:43] <arschmitz> agcolom: im looking into it
[10:14:20] <agcolom> arschmitz: I have no other device to try... My family has just gone on holiday and my kids took all my iPads!
[10:14:43] <arschmitz> agcolom: i tested on iphone 5s and it does it too
[10:14:49] <arschmitz> i can test on several ipads
[10:14:56] <agcolom> oh good! 
[10:48:14] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: got a quick question
[10:48:21] <scott_gonzalez> yes?
[10:48:31] <gseguin> so I'm working on automating the release
[10:48:43] <gseguin> cloning the codeorigin repo
[10:48:54] <gseguin> and adding the files after copying them
[10:49:12] <gseguin> right now I'm hitting an issue because I cloned the repo in dist/
[10:49:25] <gseguin> and when I do the git commit via grunt-git
[10:49:39] <gseguin> the dist directory is in the .gitignore
[10:49:43] <gseguin> so git barfs
[10:50:03] <gseguin> would you clone the codeorigin repo in .. instead ?
[10:50:08] <scott_gonzalez> You should look at how the UI release works.
[10:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> The first thing it does is create a new directory to work in.
[10:50:26] <gseguin> at which level?
[10:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we would do the clone as a sibling of the code repo.
[10:50:44] <gseguin> ok
[10:51:03] <gseguin> that's what I was going to do, just wanted to double check with you
[10:51:10] <gseguin> and then you clean it, right?
[10:51:28] <scott_gonzalez> We just leave everything there. Useful for managing files manually at the end if you need to.
[10:51:29] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/release/release.js#L555
[10:51:39] <gseguin> ok, cool
[10:51:42] <scott_gonzalez> We generate a __release directory.
[10:51:42] <gseguin> thanks!
[10:51:50] <scott_gonzalez> Then we clone everything inside that.
[10:51:57] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[10:51:59] <gseguin> I'll use the same convention
[10:53:26] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe one day we'll be able to abstract this and just hook in project-specific stuff.
[10:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> We could have the same process manage both of our builds, but have different implementations for things like getting the list of issues.
[10:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> Since ours will be for Trac and yours will be for GitHub.
[10:54:39] <gseguin> yeah that would be ideal
[11:06:15] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: our change log is already based on yours only real difference is ours of course uses the github api for issues
[11:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> Right, I'm saying it'd be nice if we restructure the code so we can actually share instead of copying.
[11:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> But it's pretty low priority.
[11:09:56] <arschmitz> yeah i know i was just meaning for change log it would be pretty simple since they are essentially the same execpt having to separate out the issues
[11:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Ready to go over Pointer Events?
[11:22:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping! In https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/174 what did you mean by "... and deprecate it from page"?
[11:22:16] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #174 by arschmitz (4d 42m ago): document degrade input
[11:22:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's not present in entries/page.xml ...
[11:22:39] <arschmitz> right it needs to be added
[11:22:44] <arschmitz> and marked as deprecated
[11:23:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see ... page had such an option?
[11:23:56] <arschmitz> no
[11:24:06] <arschmitz> it was like keepnative
[11:24:18] <arschmitz> where we just told people to set it on the page prototype for some reason
[11:24:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[11:24:36] <arschmitz> why we would do that is beyond me but oh well 
[11:24:42] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[11:26:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looks like degradeInputsWithin could be turned into a jQuery plugin just like enhanceWithin.
[11:26:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: And we could move $.mobile.degradeInputs to $.fn.degradeInputsWithin.defaults
[11:27:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But anyway, it's too late now.
[11:27:43] <arschmitz> yeah we have a couple other function that have weirdness like that too we should clean up iv noticed
[11:29:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ... so where exactly should I put the blurb saying "Don't set $.mobile.page.prototype.options.degradeInputs anymore, but do the same thing at $.mobile.degradeInputs"?
[11:29:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: add a degrade inputs entry all on its own 
[11:30:00] <arschmitz> and then in page widget add the option
[11:30:04] <arschmitz> and mark it deprecated
[11:30:08] <arschmitz> and point to new entry
[11:30:12] <arschmitz> oh not its own entry
[11:30:19] <arschmitz> sorry on the configuring defaults page
[11:30:39] <_|Nix|_> OK, I'm confused now.
[11:31:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I should add degradeInputs to pages/global-config.html?
[11:31:24] <arschmitz> yes
[11:31:31] <arschmitz> and to page widget
[11:31:35] <_|Nix|_> OK, and then page option pointing to it.
[11:31:38] <_|Nix|_> Roger that!
[11:31:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome thanks
[11:33:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I should also document $.mobile.degradeInputsWithin ...
[11:33:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[11:33:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.

[13:47:07] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Ping! Is there an example somewhere of documenting the properties of an object-valued widget option?
[13:51:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Looks like only object-valued arguments can be expounded upon.
[13:55:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK. No can do, AFAICT.
[13:56:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can't pull the classes option into one option because the XSL doesn't support it AFAICT. I'll go with <option name="classes.xxxx">...</option> like it is now.
