[07:07:34] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Awesome!
[07:07:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Pong!
[07:08:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you had some notes about things you wanted in nav at one point do you know where those were?
[07:10:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Should still be in the wiki.
[07:10:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok thanks
[07:10:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, no ... they're gone ... 
[07:10:48] <gabriel_schulhof> We must've cleaned up the wiki at some point.
[07:11:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, no ... nm ... "Show 37 more pages" :)
[07:11:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Nav-thoughts Reading it myself ... I know a lot more now than when I wrote that :)
[07:12:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: if you want to update it that would be really helpfull
[07:12:35] <arschmitz> if you have a minute before say 2pm eastern lol
[07:13:44] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[07:13:50] <jqcommit> [13api.jquerymobile.com] 15agcolom opened issue #341: Old docs don't link to corresponding resources 02http://git.io/IZhOsg
[07:14:45] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I think my basic wish remains for there to be a way to specify that you do not wish the URL to be deep-linkable.
[07:15:05] <arschmitz> ok
[07:15:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I've actually implemented this, and I've found that it's not as easy as it sounds.
[07:15:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It's easy enough to mark a history entry as unreachable, and have the nav code skip over it by calling .back() one more time, but the problem is: what if you don't want to skip over it?
[07:16:50] <arschmitz> but you marked it unreachable
[07:16:56] <arschmitz> so why would you not want to skip it
[07:17:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Because it's unreachable via deep-link, but not via in-app navigation.
[07:17:32] <gabriel_schulhof> i.e., the open-a-dialog-from-a-dialog scenario. When you close the second dialog, you wanna stop at the first dialog. However, the history looks like this: [reachable]->[unreachable]->[unreachable], so when you close the second dialog and wanna return to the first.
[07:18:08] <arschmitz> if you want to reach #2 it should not be "unreachable"
[07:18:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, you wanna reach it, but you don't want the user to be able to deep link to that.
[07:18:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: then we should add a way to link to a unique history entry maybe
[07:19:19] <arschmitz> directly like to do a change page to it
[07:19:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... oh, and you no longer wanna reach it when the user closes all dialogs and then presses forward.
[07:19:52] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so right now each internal history entry has a unique identifier 
[07:20:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so we should make the page container go method accept that
[07:20:22] <arschmitz> and make a method to retrieve them as well
[07:21:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: then you could pagecontainer( "go", "unreachable-uuid" );
[07:21:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what do you think?
[07:22:15] <gabriel_schulhof> The thing is, it's not enough to provide a way to go to a specific history entry. We need to also enrich the way nav reacts to having reached a certain history entry.
[07:22:32] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: in what way?
[07:22:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Take https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/pagecontainer.js#L323 for example.
[07:23:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Right before that line, nav checks whether its a dialog, and if it's a stale dialog, then it keeps going back in the history.
[07:23:14] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: this might be a record number of pushes for an issue :)  but i just fixed the contains check to look to see if the targetElement was inside the ui container
[07:23:44] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7372 ... if you wanna see lots of commits.
[07:23:50] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: :)
[07:24:12] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The thing is, once it decides it's not a dialog, it does changeContent, and that's it.
[07:24:31] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: :)
[07:24:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We should change that so the dev gets a chance to say nono, this is stale, skip over this entry.
[07:25:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: IOW, currently the is-this-stale check is hard-coded for identifying dialogs.
[07:25:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We should open that up.
[07:25:38] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[07:25:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Together with a way of specifying that an entry be unreachable, we can have arbitrary navigation.
[07:26:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: My primary example here is GH PRs.
[07:26:12] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: They have three tabs, each with a different URL, but creating no history entry.
[07:26:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ours would kinda be the opposite, because we'd have three real history entries, but not URL.
[07:26:40] <arschmitz> yes they use replace state
[07:26:44] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, I guess GH is a counter example :)
[07:26:51] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: also note they recent broke this kinda bad in chrome on github
[07:28:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: An easy way to open up whether you wanna keep skipping is to have _changeContent() return true or false here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/pagecontainer.js#L323
[07:29:29] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: i.e., if ( !this._changeContent( this._handleDestination( to ), changePageOptions ) { if ( data.direction === "back" ) { this.back(); } else { this.forward(); } }
[07:29:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... then we can handle it via whether default was prevented on pagebeforechange.
[07:30:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Bah, no ... that's ugly, because default can be prevented for other reasons too.
[07:30:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, anyway, if we wanted to do this, that would be the place where we would open it up.
[07:30:56] <arschmitz> ok
[07:31:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I already have an implementation of doing unreachable URLs, but it's missing the hook for telling nav to stop. I can complete the implementation and push that to a branch for review.
[07:31:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im more just looking for a wish list right now
[07:32:11] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I dunno how blue-sky I should go ... I mean, multiple pagecontainers per document was kinda on the roadmap at some point.
[07:32:26] <arschmitz> yes it still is for sure
[07:32:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, I mean, I obviously wish very much for that as well, but that's a bigger project.
[07:32:59] <arschmitz> yes
[07:33:07] <arschmitz> but very much in the range of what im looking for
[07:33:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Alright, then I hereby wish it ;)
[07:34:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Of course, grain-of-salt: I don't actually have an application in my back pocket for which I need it, so maybe we should (somehow) canvas our audience for nav features they'd like to see.
[07:38:44] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: At https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7757/files#diff-1d5adb10249a8b87ebe274787293060eR636 you still need to $( currentElement ).blur() otherwise you'll get an exception.
[07:55:27] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: ah, rather than just currentElement.blur
[07:55:28] <ldeluca> okay
[07:56:39] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Yep :)
[08:28:06] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: Any idea if Jasper is on vacation or similar? Haven't seen him around for several days
[08:28:19] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: not that i know of
[08:30:34] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: okay. Completely unrelated, any idea why Travis might "ignore" some commits? The last one here doesn't trigger a build: https://github.com/jzaefferer/qunit/commits/master - the previous one was built immediately: https://travis-ci.org/jzaefferer/qunit/branches - I've tried that several times now, without success
[08:31:00] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: weird no i have no seen that before
[08:32:37] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: you're not really helping :/
[08:32:44] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sorry
[08:32:57] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: thanks for looking :-) just a little frustrated here
[08:33:06] <jzaefferer> can't get browserstack-runner to work with Globalize either
[08:33:07] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah im looking at the travis thing
[08:34:10] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: have you just tried pushing another commit?
[08:34:25] <arschmitz> like something just trivial to see if it triggers a build
[08:37:29] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: yeah, that's what the previous commit was
[08:37:36] <jzaefferer> I'll try it again anyway
[08:50:14] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15arschmitz created 06classes (+42 new commits): 02http://git.io/mzaZYQ

[08:54:37] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: looks like that branch needs a rebase, those draggable commits shouldn't be there, right? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/c3b8a80353e6%5E...f5b523aabc1e
[08:54:52] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah thats why i didnt do pr yet im fixiing it now
[08:56:38] <jzaefferer> So much extra code in the _elementsFromClassKey implementations :/
[08:56:50] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:57:46] <jzaefferer> I wonder if that could call this.widget() or this.element by default, then you can skip any cases that need one of those
[08:58:50] <jzaefferer> These class selectors are invalid: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/7d3875b1b893fff75e4cb021a633c2ae2af7a86b
[08:59:18] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i know i was just asking scott about something with that
[08:59:56] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: thanks for looking so quickly though :-)
[09:00:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Looks like there's no other way than to go with _elementsFromClassKey, eh?
[09:01:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: not that i thought of
[09:09:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: whats up they seem to have moved on?
[09:09:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: No idea ...
[09:09:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: huh?
[09:10:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you mentioned about your coming up with this implementation
[09:10:16] <arschmitz> like you had something to say about it so i was asking what you were going to say?
[09:10:44] <arschmitz> its pretty much exactly what you did just implemented in all the widgets
[09:10:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I was gonna ask why you couldn't simply pull from my branch and go from there?
[09:11:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I had it implemented in all the widgets in my branch. The only thing my branch was missing was unit tests.
[09:11:23] <arschmitz> there was just a ton of unrelated commits
[09:11:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what you sent me only had 2 widgets
[09:11:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/jquery-ui/commits/classes-on-the-fly-no-selection
[09:11:59] <arschmitz> oh you just sent me a compare of a couple commits
[09:12:15] <arschmitz> https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/jquery-ui/compare/051c9c10490863511d006f2a7365ab25f80bbc2c...be5a22ebc6f7db35bd5b5eff20881366cdc5e6f2
[09:13:05] <arschmitz> so the vast majority of that was unrelated so i had just taken the 3 changes that applied and went from that
[09:14:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Dang! So I wrote all the other widgets in vain ... well, I guess it served one important purpose: To prove that _elementsFromClassKey() can indeed be used for all the widgets.
[09:14:33] <arschmitz> yeah lol i had no idea you had that i had specificly asked you for what you had lol
[09:14:46] <arschmitz> and thats when you sent me that diff
[09:14:55] <arschmitz> so i thought thats all you had done just as a proof of concept
[09:15:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[09:15:23] <arschmitz> lol wasted time...
[09:15:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ... unfortunately ...
[09:15:38] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i deffinitly would have spent a lot less time just going over what you did
[09:15:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: funny looking at yours i can see things we did different 
[09:16:09] <arschmitz> and most of them i started with more similar to what you did but found a problem 
[09:16:30] <arschmitz> or better way like 90% of the time checks to hasClass can be avoided
[09:16:45] <arschmitz> by using an option value or some other state var
[09:16:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, cool!
[09:17:01] <arschmitz> and tooltip has the open tooltips sotred and dom querys will fail when nesting
[09:17:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ill go over yours for sure though you may have found things i missed too 
[09:17:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[09:18:07] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im also happy to pull your commits that i did see and just do commits do change what i modified if you want?
[09:18:38] <arschmitz> definitely not trying to steal credit for what you came up with :-)
[09:20:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Lemme first make sure that wouldn't cause you to introduce any bugs.
[09:21:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, in your version of the _setOptions() modification in the widget factory, I think you inadvertently removed options[ key ] = value;
[09:21:49] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: give me a few minutes to repush that branch
[09:22:19] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: lemme check
[09:22:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup your right
[09:23:22] <arschmitz> i had tried a few things in there and accidently removed that
[09:23:35] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So yeah, aside from that, and the fact that the widget methods are in a different order, I think the implementation is the same.
[09:23:38] <arschmitz> i think when i removed var = classKey
[09:23:58] <arschmitz> that was the only real thing i ended up changing
[09:25:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: which is not a bug of course just really minor style thing
[09:26:18] <gabriel_schulhof> autocomplete is also identical, aside from a comment on my part highlighting the fact that the switch will fall through because there's no break statement.
[09:26:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Unfortunately calling .hasClass() cannot be avoided there, it seems.
[09:26:43] <arschmitz> button is but thats getting rebased out anyway
[09:27:04] <arschmitz> that commit will be removed by the new button
[09:28:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I think accordion is also identical.
[09:28:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: autocomplete i changed its just not pushed
[09:28:53] <arschmitz> changed widget() to this.menu.element
[09:28:58] <arschmitz> to avoid the method call
[09:29:16] <arschmitz> but again thats minor and i can fix it in a follow up commit
[09:29:25] <arschmitz> and just rebase it 
[09:29:29] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's about it, I think.
[09:29:45] <arschmitz> yeah its just those 3 commits
[09:30:03] <arschmitz> becuase button i didnt even look at and just compied because its going away
[09:30:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[09:30:17] <arschmitz> i just wanted it until i rebase with button for completeness when i write a unit test
[09:30:29] <arschmitz> because yours used the demos
[09:30:42] <arschmitz> in ui the have a common widget tests
[09:30:53] <arschmitz> that runs on auto generated elements and runs common tests
[09:30:59] <arschmitz> so this should be in there 
[09:30:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[09:31:10] <arschmitz> when we have time im going to adapt it for mobile
[09:31:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, my way of testing was anything but orthodox :)
[09:31:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Would it help if I rebased those commits on top of petersendidit's original PR?
[09:31:47] <arschmitz> nah ill just remove mine 
[09:31:50] <arschmitz> cherry pick yours
[09:31:50] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or can you cherry-pick them as is?
[09:31:53] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[09:31:59] <arschmitz> and rebase the changes i made
[09:32:06] <arschmitz> if your ok with that since they are really minor
[09:32:16] <gabriel_schulhof> For sure!
[09:32:35] <arschmitz> i dont really want to add extra commits for such minor changes
[09:33:02] <gabriel_schulhof> No worries.
[09:33:16] <gabriel_schulhof> ... especially since these can't really be squashed.
[09:33:29] <arschmitz> exactly
[11:01:07] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I think I figured out the Travis issue. Helped to try to tell someone about it (I deleted my draft message after confirming my suspicion)
[11:01:26] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: awesome what was it
[11:01:36] <jzaefferer> backticks are invalid 
[11:01:42] <arschmitz> ohhhh
[11:01:45] <jzaefferer> in .travis.yml, at least at the start of a line
[11:02:08] <arschmitz> that would have taken me days lol
[11:02:10] <jzaefferer> and I had the "Build only if .travis.yml is present" setting enabled, which caused the commit to be completely ignored
[11:02:24] <jzaefferer> disabling that at least showed me a build with the error message
[11:02:37] <jzaefferer> which also points out http://lint.travis-ci.org/
[11:08:45] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: looks like escaping backtick with backslash doesn't work: https://travis-ci.org/jzaefferer/qunit/builds/38070716
[11:11:50] <jzaefferer> fingers crossed: https://travis-ci.org/jzaefferer/qunit/builds/38072091
[11:20:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Ping!
[12:37:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What's up?
[12:38:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: your getting one of your wishes
[12:38:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Which one is that?
[12:41:29] <arschmitz> multiple page containers
[12:41:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[12:41:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: right now the intel app framework has this
[12:41:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, wow! Cool!
[12:42:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and I taked to Ian earlier and he wants to contribute to mobile and work on this
[12:42:23] <gabriel_schulhof> Awesome!
[12:43:10] <arschmitz> he has a very basic implementation in appmobile / intel app framework so hes got a handle on a lot of the potential pitfalls 
[12:43:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and you will likely get your other wish as a result
[12:44:07] <arschmitz> we will need much more granular history control to do this
[12:44:14] <arschmitz> including non deep lonkable pages
[12:45:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, definitely. The ability to squeeze multiple history entries under a single location is a must if you're gonna navigate areas of a single document.
[12:46:33] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and the ability to "outsource" what happens upon hitting back/forward is also important.
[13:28:10] <ldeluca> arschmitz: mind closing this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6582
[13:32:19] <arschmitz> ldeluca: did you get a chance to try the work arounds in the Stackoverflow links i sent you to see if any of them worked?
[13:33:04] <arschmitz> ldeluca: if there is a feasible work around to fix it we should do so but if there is nothing we can do there is nothing we can do the appearence of a scroll bar while visually annoying does not "Break" anything.
[13:34:06] <ldeluca> arschmitz: I don't remember seeing a work around suggested.  Happen to have the link handy?  I will gladly test
[13:34:31] <arschmitz> ldeluca: just a sec let me see if i can find it again
[13:37:59] <arschmitz> ldeluca: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16469548/overflowhidden-not-working-with-translation-in-positive-direction
[13:38:41] <ldeluca> arschmitz: trying
[13:40:01] <arschmitz> ldeluca: the other one wont work for our case so guess thats the only 1 to try
[13:41:02] <arschmitz> ldeluca: another option actually might be i read somewhere overflow:hidden works while overflow-x does not
[13:41:13] <arschmitz> which we cant always apply because it would kill scrolling
[13:41:19] <arschmitz> but we could do it durring transitions
[13:42:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz, ldeluca: There's another focus thing we can fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7533, but it's not strictly part of the bug.
[13:42:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh about that issue i have not been following it because it seemed like your pretty on top of it
[13:43:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so just ping me ( not in the issue ill never notice )
[13:43:12] <arschmitz> when its ready for me to review
[13:43:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz, ldeluca: When you tab around with a popup open that has focusables inside, the tabbing chain does not start to work until you manually focus one of the focusables.
[13:43:37] <ldeluca> arschmitz: yea, adding position: fixed to .slide.out and .slide.in styles removes the scroll bar
[13:43:55] <arschmitz> ldeluca: what about absolute? 
[13:43:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I guess I'm asking whether it's OK to add this one fix to this PR, or whether we should do another issue/PR.
[13:44:13] <ldeluca> arschmitz: trying
[13:44:14] <arschmitz> same pr is fine just seperate commits of course
[13:44:19] <arschmitz> they are roughly related
[13:44:33] <arschmitz> ldeluca: try the overflow vs overflow x too
[13:44:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK.
[13:44:43] <arschmitz> that seems like the least likely to break some other layout issue
[13:44:49] <ldeluca> arschmitz: position absolute does NOT work
[13:44:58] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Let's improve the focus handling a bit for that PR.
[13:45:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Sheesh! Where on youtube.com can you get a list of the videos you've uploaded ... *sigh*
[13:46:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: uploads lol
[13:46:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, and then you click Edit, and then finally you get the video manager on the right.
[13:46:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The one I wanted to show you was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-lcT4dpSKE
[13:46:43] <arschmitz> https://www.youtube.com/user/gabrielschulhof/videos
[13:46:47] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ^^
[13:47:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Aaaaah! OK.
[13:47:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah we need to fix that
[13:48:00] <arschmitz> thats essentially completely inaccessible 
[13:48:03] <ldeluca> arschmitz: overflow: hidden doesn't work
[13:48:16] <arschmitz> ldeluca: darn...
[13:48:25] <arschmitz> thats the one i was really hoping for
[13:48:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, you can click on one of the inputs and the focus chain starts to work, but it's definitely not keyboard-friendly.
[13:48:32] <ldeluca> arschmitz: see any reason why we can't do position: relative on the css for the transformations?
[13:48:45] <arschmitz> ldeluca: yes
[13:49:00] <arschmitz> breaks something else
[13:49:18] <arschmitz> ldeluca: the relative vs absolute placment of pages we have gone in circles on a few times
[13:49:35] <arschmitz> it creats tons of transition problems with headers that are outside the page
[13:50:18] <ldeluca> arschmitz: okay, so I'll add a comment to the issue pointing people to the stack overflow issue and they can try at their own risk?
[13:50:27] <arschmitz> ldeluca: you can experiment with it and you might find a way that works though the key will be to test it with fixed and unfixed headers and foots to make sure they dont get worse
[13:51:25] <arschmitz> right now it gets juggled a bit durring transitions and here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L274
[13:52:16] <arschmitz> ldeluca: your welcome to dive in and try to find something better then what we have i burnt out on finding the right combo for all situations lol
[13:53:08] <arschmitz> ldeluca: does position relative fix the issue?
[13:53:19] <ldeluca> arschmitz: yea, it does
[13:53:47] <arschmitz> ldeluca: if i recall the absolute position is only for the slide transition
[13:54:02] <arschmitz> this issue is slide only too right ?
[13:54:24] <ldeluca> arschmitz: i believe so, that's what it's opened against. haven't tried to reproduce with the others
[13:54:35] <arschmitz> ldeluca: yeah that makes sense
[13:54:45] <arschmitz> ldeluca: the slide transition is very different then any other
[13:54:58] <arschmitz> ldeluca: its the only transition where both pages are visible and transition at the same time
[13:58:22] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz closed issue #7776: jquery.mobile-1.4.4.min.js contains error 02http://git.io/CiUdSg
[13:59:03] <arschmitz> ldeluca: so normally relative is fine the other page just sits below the current one hidden when the current one becomes hidden the new one is shown in the proper place
[13:59:22] <arschmitz> ldeluca: but for slide they need to be absolute so they can be beside eachother and slider properly
[14:02:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7776 - I doubt it's a problem - I mean, we'd've heard by now if our minified source were broken.
[14:02:45] <ldeluca> arschmitz: misspoke, position relative doens't work, position FIXED is what works
[14:02:47] <ldeluca> relative doesn't work
[14:03:19] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah thats why i closed it along with being incomplete
[14:03:36] <arschmitz> ldeluca: ok yeah fixed is a whole other can of works
[14:03:39] <arschmitz> worms
[14:03:59] <arschmitz> ldeluca: i tried to use it on page durring transtions to fix a different problem once it causes lots of other problems on android
[14:04:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, the OP /is/ kinda right. Looking at the code, I don't see how JS parses that regex correctly. There really is a / in the middle of it.
[14:04:24] <arschmitz> ldeluca: also then the page would sit on top of external toolbars durring transtions if they were not also fixed
[14:05:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, I think I know why it parses correctly. We have /(.../...)/g ... so the intervening slash is inside a bracket.
[14:06:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, and it's inside [] as well. OK. Definitely no error.
[14:06:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Man what are those things called ... [] and [0-9] and [a-z] and those ... *sigh* ... need to look it up ...
[14:07:12] <arschmitz> character sets
[14:07:19] <arschmitz> i believe
[14:07:26] <gabriel_schulhof> character classes
[14:07:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Actually both are correct.
[14:07:40] <gabriel_schulhof> http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html
[14:07:42] <arschmitz> :-)
[14:08:02] <arschmitz> and yeah rules are different inside those
[14:08:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: In fact, [/] is a common way to escape the slash.
[14:08:28] <ldeluca> arschmitz: okay, so i added a comment, should we go ahead and close this now that the work around isn't going to work for jquery-mobile?
[14:08:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll explain to the OP.
[14:08:39] <arschmitz> ldeluca: yes 
[14:09:45] <ldeluca> btw, how would i add a label to a github issue?  or is that not allowed except for project admins?
[14:10:02] <arschmitz> ldeluca: its linked to commit access
[14:10:16] <ldeluca> arschmitz: okay, just curious
[14:16:59] <gabriel_schulhof> It's actually kinda bad that GH doesn't have greater granularity in terms of permissions.
[14:17:25] <gabriel_schulhof> After all, they provide a lot of stuff that git does not, but their permissions are linked purely to git.
[14:18:10] <gabriel_schulhof> So, OK, they have one more level - owner of the repo, but c'mon, even that's git-related.
[14:23:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I briefly added you as a collaborator to my clone of jQM just to convince myself that they haven't added any new permissions.
[14:51:05] <Omar-> hi
[14:51:49] <Omar-> $.mobile.path.parseUrl(url).search returns no value, not even undefined on "pagecontainerbeforechange" when data.toPage == string
[14:57:28] <Omar-> sorry my bad, localhost issue :)
[15:02:22] <Omar-> .hash returns correct value, but .search doesn't
[15:02:51] <Omar-> btw, the demo buttons here http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.path.parseUrl/ aren't working
[15:19:15] <Omar-> I found out why, it considers it "hash"
[15:19:32] <Omar-> if url www.foo.com/#bar?id=hi
[15:19:46] <Omar-> .hash returns #bar?id=hi
[15:23:19] <arschmitz> Omar-: yes because thats part of the hash
[15:23:27] <arschmitz> there is no such thing as query strings in a hash
[15:23:38] <arschmitz> as far as the browser is concerned
[15:30:13] <Omar-> arschmitz so by default query string is neglect by browser?
[15:30:24] <arschmitz> no thats not a query string
[15:30:26] <arschmitz> thats a hash
[15:30:35] <arschmitz> a query sting is example.com?foo=bar
[15:30:58] <arschmitz> Omar-: any thing that comes after # ish the hash
[15:32:13] <Omar-> arschmitz oh I see, I understand now
[15:32:24] <Omar-> thanks arschmitz :)
[15:32:47] <Omar-> so .split("?") will do the job
[15:33:03] <Omar-> if i'm using #page?id=45 for example
[15:33:15] <arschmitz> Omar-: yes
[15:34:28] <Omar-> arschmitz thanks again
[15:34:44] <arschmitz> Omar-: no problem
[15:34:54] <Omar-> are you going to surprise us in next release? ;)
[15:35:14] <Omar-> any new additions?
[15:35:15] <arschmitz> Omar-: meaning?
[15:35:30] <arschmitz> Omar-: there are massive changes in the next release actually
[15:36:03] <arschmitz> new autoinit thats load order independant, button, checkboxradio, and controlgroup are all being replaced
[15:36:19] <Omar-> wow
[15:36:22] <arschmitz> re written navbar and tables
[15:36:34] <Omar-> tabs is causing some problems yup
[15:36:59] <arschmitz> tabs will be fixed its been known how to fix it since release but it had to wait for new version of ui to be released
[15:37:10] <arschmitz> the fix was in ui not mobile
[15:37:44] <Omar-> I saw one issue that it causes reloading the page several times
[15:37:47] <arschmitz> Omar-: mobile button checkboxradio and navbar are all being replaced by new ui versions
[15:37:50] <Omar-> I thought it was navigation issue
[15:38:04] <arschmitz> Omar-: it has to do with the way tabs handles base
[15:38:17] <arschmitz> it thinks its pulling the content via ajax when its local
[15:38:18] <Omar-> arschmitz I look forward to seeing the new release
[15:38:32] <arschmitz> Omar-: and there will be a new option on all widgets named classes
[15:38:39] <Omar-> to be honest, I haven't play around much with tabs
[15:39:10] <Omar-> arschmitz classes option is already availabe, or am I mixing up with something else?
[15:39:31] <arschmitz> Omar-: no its not its part of ui and has not landed yet 
[15:39:47] <Omar-> oh ok, then I'm talking about something else
[15:39:49] <arschmitz> Omar-: you can watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qF7kW9SdJQ&list=PL-0yjdC10QYpmXI3l-PGK1od4kTWOjm_A&index=4 for more info on our future plans
[15:40:01] <arschmitz> Omar-: maybe your thinking of wrapperClass?
[15:40:13] <Omar-> arschmitz btw, can you give an option for "data-clear-btn" for type="search"? http://stackoverflow.com/a/26392075/1771795
[15:40:35] <Omar-> arschmitz data-wrapper-class is an outstanding addition, +1 great job!
[15:40:40] <arschmitz> Omar-: we may in the future but the textinput widget will be replaced in 1.6
[15:40:53] <arschmitz> Omar-: data-wrapperclass will be deprecated in 1.5
[15:40:59] <arschmitz> replaced by classes
[15:41:03] <Omar-> and textinputcreate event doesn't fire
[15:41:06] <Omar-> hmmmm
[15:41:20] <Omar-> don't think this will confuse users?
[15:41:26] <Omar-> don't you
[15:41:28] <arschmitz> Omar-: what do you mean?
[15:41:34] <arschmitz> what will confuse users?
[15:41:42] <Omar-> I mean adding a new feature then removing it
[15:41:46] <Omar-> users = developers
[15:41:59] <arschmitz> Omar-: maybe but unlikely thats why we have an api
[15:42:14] <arschmitz> Omar-: and classes does everything you can do with wrapperClass and much much more
[15:42:40] <arschmitz> its allows you to add classes to any element of a widget
[15:42:44] <arschmitz> and it actually maintains state
[15:42:53] <arschmitz> its much much more flexible
[15:42:57] <Omar-> and boosts performanc
[15:42:58] <Omar-> e
[15:43:32] <Omar-> my laptop is out of battery :/
[15:43:33] <arschmitz> Omar-: it does not boost performance classes option has nothing to do with perf
[15:43:59] <Omar-> arschmitz lol mind my ignorance, you're talking to a Marketer :)
[15:44:51] <arschmitz> Omar-: you could use classes to use the bootstrap theme instead of the mobile one
[15:44:58] <Omar-> I came to know jQM by coincidence
[15:45:12] <arschmitz> Omar-: or almost any other theme really
[15:45:39] <Omar-> nice, I have seen many asking about integating both UI's
[15:45:55] <Omar-> I assume your job is tougher now
[15:46:02] <arschmitz> Omar-: nope
[15:46:04] <Omar-> I wish you all, all the best
[15:46:24] <arschmitz> Omar-: thanks
[15:46:32] <Omar-> my pleasure
[15:46:36] <arschmitz> Omar-: that youtube video should give you a good idea what we have going on
[15:46:45] <arschmitz> Omar-: if you have any additional questions let me know
[15:46:55] <Omar-> I'll check it on ipad, my laptop is gona die in 3 mins
[15:47:06] <Omar-> sure, I'll let you know
[15:47:16] <Omar-> gonna*
[15:47:47] <Omar-> arschmitz take care, talk to you tomorrow
[15:47:57] <Omar-> good luck team jQM!
