[09:02:46] <jzaefferer> jquery ui meeting in #jquery-meeting going down now!
[10:01:00] <rworth> jquery ui grid meeting in #jquery-meeting going down now :)
[10:01:24] <gnarf> ii think we should avoid "going down" when talking about stuff
[10:01:38] <rworth> it's on
[10:01:46] <rworth> I mean, it's ON
[10:02:00] <gnarf> Over Now?
[10:02:07] <rworth> ha
[10:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> watch out for Richard's left bottom, it might be turned on as well :-)
[10:02:26] <rworth> right bottom
[10:17:35] <gnarf> strange, my right top is turned on, that or its cold
[11:04:05] <gnarf> so yeah, couple of quick questions re widgets
[11:04:20] <gnarf> any thoughts on how to take behaviors from two widgets and make one? :)
[11:04:35] <gnarf> also, there is need for a "caret" handling function for mask
[11:04:36] <rworth> dialog does it
[11:04:37] <jzaefferer> make a new one, delegate to the existing ones
[11:04:50] <rworth> draggable and resizable
[11:04:50] <jzaefferer> delegation >>> inheritance
[11:04:55] <gnarf> rworth: thanks, will look
[11:05:13] <rworth> it takes care to reuse what's below but without exposing the user directly to what's below
[11:05:22] <gnarf> should i make the caret func an _caret on the widget?
[11:05:33] <rworth> so in case there were an API change for example in resizable, that doesn't directly affect the dialog api
[11:05:39] <gnarf> right
[11:05:40] <rworth> because of the abstraction layer
[11:07:47] <jzaefferer> gnarf: put the caret stuff into mask
[11:07:54] <gnarf> k
[11:07:57] <jzaefferer> unless we actually have something where we need it, keep it there
[11:08:06] <gnarf> we aren't using a caret plugin yet tho
[11:08:13] <gnarf> right
[11:08:40] <gnarf> timepicker + mask are the only uses i see right now
[11:09:59] <gnarf> cool, back to it after I get done with this work BS that creeped up on me
[11:10:08] <gnarf> afk a bit
[11:42:07] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: who did the topalign demo? you or Jörn?
[11:43:08] <kborchers> me
[11:44:33] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[11:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> was putting together this week's UI update
[11:45:03] <kborchers> oh, ok
[11:45:27] <kborchers> digging into flip/fit in position. lots of fun ;)
[12:17:10] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/0ba493d3b4f9d6da35cadc499e9f7ebb6adb31b3
[12:17:10] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Merge remote branch 'kborchers/menu_focus' - Jörn Zaefferer
[13:04:42] <gnarf> k, back to widgets
[13:04:43] <gnarf> :)
[13:23:07] <kborchers> jzaefferer and/or scott_gonzalez have a minute to chat about position? so far, only issue i am noticing is that "fit" will sometimes position the element over its "of". any other issues i should be concerned with?
[13:23:44] <scott_gonzalez> working on smarter collision detection?
[13:23:51] <kborchers> yes
[13:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> it only applies to fit
[13:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[13:24:04] <scott_gonzalez> flip
[13:24:05] <scott_gonzalez> FLIP
[13:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> wait, that's not true
[13:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> stupid position
[13:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok, here's the deal
[13:24:32] <kborchers> flip seems ok, it's fit that seems messed up right?
[13:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> sometimes collision detection makes things worse
[13:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> let's say you're using flip
[13:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> and the of element is 100px from the left of the window
[13:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> and 200px from the right of the window
[13:25:33] <scott_gonzalez> your element is 300px wide, so it doesn't fit on either side
[13:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> but you're trying to position it on the right
[13:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> where it falls off the screen by 100px
[13:25:58] <scott_gonzalez> right now flip will say "hey, that doesn't fit, let me put it on the left"
[13:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> at which point you will be 200px off the screen
[13:26:09] <scott_gonzalez> so flipping was a bad idea
[13:26:37] <kborchers> ok, that makes sense so it needs to check collision again after a flip to make sure it's not worse, right?
[13:27:35] <kborchers> then somehow flip it back and not collision detect again?
[13:27:54] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, when it calculates the flipped position, it needs to do the check again
[13:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> and if it made it worse, it shouldn't do anything
[13:28:05] <scott_gonzalez> if it made it better, it should apply the change
[13:28:17] <scott_gonzalez> there's a similar situation for fit
[13:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> if your element is really big, you might end up shifting too far
[13:28:44] <scott_gonzalez> but in the case of fit, it's not an all or nothing
[13:28:54] <scott_gonzalez> it needs to be smart enough to just stop shifting at a certain point
[13:30:37] <kborchers> question is what is that certain point? before it shifts to far and leave a bunch hanging on one side, middle ground between the two overhangs?
[13:31:05] <gnarf> hrm, so the context of functions in a widget is the widget instance, always right?
[13:31:41] <gnarf> so if i were writing a _caret, i'd use this.element and assume it was a $() of the element, and has a length of 1?
[13:31:47] <gnarf> and not be incorrect?
[13:31:52] <kborchers> and then should I also address the fit issue here where the elements is positioned over its "of"? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5284#comment:3
[13:32:43] <kborchers> and to address that, do we flip even though they didn't want flip or just let it hang over the collision point?
[13:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's ok for fit to cause the element to overlap the of
[13:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> isn't that the expected outcome of fit?
[13:35:28] <scott_gonzalez> I think the point at which to stop is when you start going offscreen in both directions
[13:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: that's correct
[13:36:27] <kborchers> that makes sense in both cases. stop when both collisions will happen and if they use fit and it overlaps the element and they don't want that, don't use fit
[13:37:21] <scott_gonzalez> right
[13:37:27] <kborchers> thanks for the help, that should get me going.
[13:39:37] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[13:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: you around?
[13:57:40] <gnarf> so what should i be using for commonWidgetTests to test an option without a default, just leave it out?
[13:58:40] <scott_gonzalez> all options have defaults
[13:58:50] <scott_gonzalez> the default can be null though
[13:59:20] <gnarf> k
[13:59:21] <scott_gonzalez> defaults should also be alphabetized and callbacks should be separated
[13:59:42] <scott_gonzalez> see tabs for an example
[14:00:38] <scott_gonzalez> it makes it really easy to get an overview of the API by looking at the source

[14:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> thoughts?

[14:02:00] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/mask] Mask: Adding some widget/unit test boilerplates - Corey Frang
[14:02:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: looks like a decent dir listing of our cdn'ed versions?
[14:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[14:03:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'll send the file to Dan
[14:03:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: these boilerplates look alright? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/953ff49%5E...953ff49
[14:03:46] <gnarf> oops comment is wrong on ui.mask.js
[14:03:56] <gnarf> should be jQuery UI Mask @VERSION right?
[14:04:00] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[14:04:05] <gnarf> and url
[14:04:22] <gnarf> anyone mind if i just rebase that? :)
[14:04:25] <gnarf> force the push?
[14:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> heh, go for it
[14:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> only because it's brand new and unlikely to break something
[14:04:48] <gnarf> yeah
[14:05:08] <gnarf> any other blantant issues with the boilerplates?
[14:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> I've come to accept the fact that imperfect history is just part of life :-)
[14:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I'm gonna do some fixes and commit
[14:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> it'll be easier than trying to point everything out
[14:05:28] <gnarf> k
[14:05:37] <scott_gonzalez> the diff will be better than anything I can say
[14:05:57] <gnarf> forcing push of that one fix
[14:06:01] <gnarf> up now
[14:06:05] <gnarf> feel free to pull/fix

[14:11:42] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/mask] Mask tests: cleanup. - Scott González
[14:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> one of these days all of our files will be correct, so it'll be easy to get new files right :-)
[14:16:10] <gnarf> i shoulda known the type= one
[14:16:13] <gnarf> its bitten me a few times
[14:16:22] <gnarf> sry
[14:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:16:54] <gnarf> hrm, we prefer (fn(){ }( jQuery ) )?
[14:17:33] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[14:17:44] <gnarf> that core or ui ?
[14:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> apparently even core doesn't do it
[14:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> it's safer from bad code concatenation
[14:18:35] <gnarf> true i suppose
[14:18:48] <gnarf> the ";" kinda protects there tho right?
[14:18:56] <gnarf> i suppose thats missing in .min
[14:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, we don't do the ; anymore
[14:20:01] <gnarf> k, i'll strip those out
[14:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> heh, jquery.effects.core.js has it :-)
[14:21:11] <scott_gonzalez> we should probably make a definite decision project-wide for parens inside or outside
[14:21:23] <gnarf> agreed
[14:21:49] <gnarf> personal pref is (fn(){})(args)
[14:22:06] <gnarf> but that has zero reasoning other than i think it looks nicer
[14:22:21] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I had done that forever
[14:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> then rworth told me about (fn(){}())
[14:22:47] <scott_gonzalez> heh, that kinda has nice symmetry when the function is empty :-P
[14:22:57] <gnarf> agreed
[14:23:23] <gnarf> i can understand the reasoning for doing it that way
[14:23:35] <scott_gonzalez> I think it might also be for clarity (doesn't really apply when wrapping an entire file)
[14:24:06] <gnarf> i actually think (fn(){})(args) is more clear
[14:24:35] <gnarf> (fn(){}(args)) just feels "odd" trailing the args right off the function expression
[14:24:48] <gnarf> but it is crockfords pref too right?
[14:24:49] <gnarf> :)
[14:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, that's where Richard got it from
[14:34:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: should i test private methods in the units?
[14:34:44] <gnarf> like this _caret?
[14:35:57] <gnarf> so i'm not liking this leaving off the trailing ; btw
[14:36:03] <gnarf> its causing jslint warning
[14:41:33] <rworth> its crock and souders
[14:43:49] <gnarf> I think we should leave the trailing ; on the file
[14:43:56] <gnarf> minifier strips it anyway right?
[15:00:47] <rworth> jslint wants it there? That doesn't sound right
[15:02:26] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] gnarf37 pushed 2 new commits to mask: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/936193f...9dacfd1
[15:02:26] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/mask] Unit Tests: Adding mask to all.html - Corey Frang
[15:02:26] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/mask] Mask: Initial draft of _caret, implementation borrowed from @digitalBush maskedInput plugin - Corey Frang
[15:02:27] <gnarf> jslint is giving me a warning if the ; at the end of file is not there
[15:06:56] <gnarf> so how do i view that unit on that branch using view.jqueryui.org? :)
[15:07:17] <gnarf> nvm, figured it out i think
[15:07:25] <gnarf> yup
[15:07:34] <gnarf> but it doesn't have that new push yet
[15:07:35] <gnarf> hrm
[15:07:40] * gnarf waits for a cron
[15:07:52] <gnarf> anyone know how long that takes to update?
[15:16:18] <gnarf> is there a better way to get the widget instance than .data( "mask" ) ?
[15:17:40] <gnarf> ajpiano: do you know that one? :)
[15:18:01] <ajpiano> no idea
[15:22:27] <gnarf> thought maybe widget factory might of covered that
[15:22:28] <gnarf> :)
[15:23:51] <gnarf> hrm, another design question... If I have two events possible between browsers, should i Just bind both?
[15:23:58] <gnarf> "input" or "paste" event?
[15:25:19] <gnarf> should i just ._bind({ input: handleInputOrPaste, paste: handleInputOrPaste }) ?
[15:26:03] <gnarf> also, do we use a lot of zero timeouts in UI?
[15:30:01] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: ping
[15:31:40] <rworth> gnarf: that is the way to get the instance
[15:36:33] <gnarf> I've been thinking about proposing a jQuery.zeroTimeout
[15:36:41] <gnarf> that wraps the postmessage if its there
[15:36:44] <gnarf> cuz its faster
[15:36:51] <rworth> 10 instances
[15:36:52] <rworth> autocomplete qty:2 dur:1
[15:36:52] <rworth> button qty:1 dur:1

[15:36:54] <rworth> tooltip qty:1 dur:1
[15:37:19] <gnarf> i'm gonna be adding another in mask most likely
[15:53:45] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: would love to talk to you about the widget routing events through the element, I've got some issues with it.
[16:11:39] <gnarf> hrm
[16:11:51] <gnarf> any idea why http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/unit/mask/mask.html doesn't have my new commit?
[16:12:01] <gnarf> over an hour old at this point
[16:12:50] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/unit/mask/mask_core.js != https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/mask/tests/unit/mask/mask_core.js
[16:13:22] <gnarf> danheberden ^^ ?
[16:13:28] <gnarf> not sure who to ask about that one
[16:45:23] <danheberden> gnarf try it now
[16:49:35] <gnarf> still doesn't seem right
[16:50:10] <gnarf> nope, that mask_core.js is definately not what is in github
[16:50:51] <gnarf> at least the mask_core.js that I'm receiving
[16:50:57] * gnarf tries clearing cache
[16:51:33] <gnarf> still not right
[18:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: the trailing ; is supposed to be there
[18:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> if it's missing, that's a typo
[18:10:24] <scott_gonzalez> we could add $.ui.delay() if it'd be useful
[18:10:43] <scott_gonzalez> bot-t: tell rpflo catch me during the day to talk about widget factory
[18:10:44] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[18:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: you can create the instance directly if you want
[18:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> I do that in a few of the widget factory tests
[22:01:43] <kborchers> ?tell gnarf Hope you have power tomorrow! These storms are crazy again!
[22:01:44] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[22:20:57] <gnarf> i have half power :/
[22:20:58] <bot-t> (19 mins 10 secs ago) <kborchers> tell gnarf Hope you have power tomorrow! These storms are crazy again!
[22:23:07] <gnarf> ?tell kborchers I have some strange "half power" -- enough for the laptop / interneet, but not for AC, Stereo, CF Bulbs (standards are working but dim)
[22:23:07] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
