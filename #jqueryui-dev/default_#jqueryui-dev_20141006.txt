[00:11:22] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #615: STILL UNSTABLE in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/615/
[04:22:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[04:53:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[04:58:17] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[04:58:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What if the custom select doesn't fall back to anything? What's wrong with a large popup?
[04:58:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The popup is designed to accommodate any amount of content.
[04:58:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Presumably, the page will pan vertically to accommodate.
[04:59:08] <arschmitz> its about usability
[04:59:10] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and the popup will never appear at a negative y-coordinate.
[04:59:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: scrolling with popups on devices is kinda meh
[04:59:39] <arschmitz> and we couldnt do it with out deprecation
[04:59:46] <arschmitz> and we want to use ui selectmenu
[04:59:50] <arschmitz> in 1.6
[05:00:01] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so we need to deprecate the whole widget.
[05:00:20] <arschmitz> no
[05:00:33] <arschmitz> you cant deprecate with out replcament
[05:00:37] <arschmitz> we need to do nothing
[05:00:42] <arschmitz> wait till 1.6
[05:00:49] <arschmitz> start using ui selectmenu and write backcompat
[05:00:54] <arschmitz> for anything it does not do
[05:01:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: in the future it will not fall back to a dialog but with either not fall back at all or will fall back to native
[05:01:41] <arschmitz> based on user setting
[05:02:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Can the UI selectmenu be made to fall back to native?
[05:02:16] <arschmitz> Not currently but it will before we use it
[05:02:33] <arschmitz> thats why we are not using it in 1.5
[05:02:36] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so it sounds like thaat's the way to go in the future.
[05:03:07] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so for 1.5, shall I replace the dialog widget with a dialog-styled page?
[05:03:49] <gabriel_schulhof> It will be deep-linkable, but the hash will not work, because I'll detach the dialog after it closes.
[05:04:37] <jquicommit> [13globalize] 15arthurvr opened pull request #334: Remove deprecated JSHint options (06master...06master) 02http://git.io/AkErdw
[05:04:37] <arschmitz> no
[05:04:37] <arschmitz> we cant do that with out deprecation
[05:04:42] <arschmitz> thats a behivor change
[05:04:56] <gabriel_schulhof> So then we can't remove the dialog widget even though we've deprecated it.
[05:05:17] <arschmitz> right
[05:05:32] <arschmitz> but we dont need to test or support or document it any more
[05:06:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, alright ... *sigh(
[05:07:14] <gabriel_schulhof> In other news, I'm having a bear of a time getting the table.columntoggle tests to pass, because for some reason the checkboxradios disappear on me.
[05:07:33] <arschmitz> disappear?
[05:08:16] <gabriel_schulhof> It's weird. I instantiate checkboxradio widgets (which are now UI checkboxradio widgets) and then, when I open the columns menu, they're not enhanced, and there's no data on them at all. Neither the widget at key "ui-checkboxradio" or any of the keys I add as part of table.columntoggle
[05:08:26] <gabriel_schulhof> It's like they're getting cloned somewhere.
[05:09:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you have labels right
[05:09:36] <gabriel_schulhof> I step throught _addToggles() and sure enough, there they are with checkboxradio instances on 'em 'n all. Then, I look at the DOM, and completely different checkboxes are present.
[05:10:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: there is one thing different
[05:10:52] <arschmitz> i dont know how this would play in
[05:10:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I have $( '<label><input type="checkbox" checked/>' + theText + '</label>' ).appendTo( menu ).children().checkboxradio();
[05:11:21] <gabriel_schulhof> So the input is a child of the label.
[05:11:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we were not originally going to support that
[05:11:45] <arschmitz> but it is and does work
[05:12:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, it does work with jQM checkboxradio.
[05:12:28] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm not sure what's going on. I'll have to trace through the table.columntoggle some more.
[05:20:36] <jquicommit> [13globalize] 15scottgonzalez closed pull request #334: Remove deprecated JSHint options (06master...06master) 02http://git.io/AkErdw
[05:21:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, the checkboxradio widgets are getting destroyed for some reason.
[05:23:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Inside refresh() the checkboxradio does this.label.html( ... ) This does not work if the label contains the input.
[05:23:45] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So the checkboxradio no longer supports having the input inside the label.
[05:25:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Now, I'm happy to modify table.columntoggle to accommodate this new state of affairs, but since we /are/ supporting that, does that not make this a backwards compatibility issue?
[05:25:35] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and by that which we are supporting I mean the markup where the input is inside the label.
[05:31:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we have demos of that it works fine im not sure what the issue is
[05:31:45] <arschmitz> ill have to look into it
[05:32:03] <arschmitz> maybe there was a regression from something
[05:32:24] <arschmitz> weird though because i swear there is even a test for it
[05:33:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The demos don't call .refresh() on checkboxradio
[05:33:53] <arschmitz> there is one that does in the visual tests
[05:34:10] <arschmitz> anyway thats a bug it will be fixed
[05:36:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/602 What am I doing wrong?
[05:36:54] <arschmitz> nothing it looks like a bug or regression
[05:37:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK.
[06:57:12] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I've gone through the tests and fixed assumptions and a few places in the lib to reflect the new widgets from UI. Can I push the commits to ui-1-12, or do I need to make a PR against ui-1-12?
[06:57:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Tests are not all green though, until checkboxradio is fixed.
[06:57:44] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... but only those are left to fix.
[06:58:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: pr please
[06:58:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK.
[06:58:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Issue too?
[07:00:47] <arschmitz> no
[07:14:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Alright. Can do.

[07:22:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oops! Controlgroup is gone as of 1.5.0, to be replaced by UI's right?
[07:31:15] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes
[07:33:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, then we need to extend it to provide the method called "container", which in 1.4.0 would return the child of this.element.
[07:33:19] <gabriel_schulhof> This is gone with UI's controlgroup, but it was public and documente.
[07:33:21] <gabriel_schulhof> dd
[07:33:29] <gabriel_schulhof> *sigh* ... I give upt
[07:33:39] <arschmitz> lol
[07:33:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: http://api.jquerymobile.com/controlgroup/#method-container
[07:34:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: crazy i had no idea that existed so its a duplicate of widget?
[07:34:34] <arschmitz> that seems dumb lol
[07:34:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Widget has a method named container?
[07:34:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no it has one named widget
[07:35:04] <arschmitz> but thats what that does if i understand
[07:35:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Nono. widget() in this case is indeed this.element, as the default implementation provides.
[07:35:38] <arschmitz> oh we use an extra element for some reason
[07:35:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: container() was this.element.children( 0 ), because it was wrapping the elements.
[07:35:43] <arschmitz> the controlgroup controls element
[07:35:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep, but no longer.
[07:35:53] <arschmitz> which i have no idea why we have it double wrapped
[07:36:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I can go back and blame it ...
[07:36:37] <arschmitz> im not too worried about it we used to be a little overzealous with our wrappers
[07:36:59] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[07:37:29] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll update that PR to reflect the situation with controlgroup.
[07:40:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oooh, I just realized one thing. Once the new autoinit lands, our widgets will no longer need to depend on js/widget.js ... right?
[07:42:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We should probably deprecate the container() method if there's gonna be no wrapper ... or should we?
[07:53:44] <arschmitz> correct
[07:53:49] <arschmitz> yes we should
[07:54:10] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[07:59:38] <ldeluca> anyone know how to assign an issue to themselves in github?  Or do you need to be a project admin to do that?
[08:02:21] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: AFAIK you have to be part of the list of collaborators for the given project in order to be able to assign an issue, including to yourself.
[08:02:42] <ldeluca> Thanks gabriel_schulhof I'll just monitor the issue for now then
[08:02:52] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Cool!

[08:12:53] <ldeluca> arschmitz and everyone, how do we address issues for older devices (web views) for jquery mobile?
[08:13:09] <ldeluca> For example, issue 7533.  I wans't able to reproduce the issue because I don't have an older mobile device
[08:13:22] <ldeluca> Does someone somewhere have access to a "device wall" to test on older devices?
[08:13:56] <ldeluca> I commented that I couldn't reproduce, do we close out the issues?  do we just leave it open?  Is there a way to mark it as needing an older device?
[08:16:30] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Not that issue! I thought we had fixed it.
[08:16:58] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: There's really no way around it. We focus the popup's container when it shows up, so yeah, sometimes the whole popup flashes.
[08:17:33] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I suppose I can be lazy about it and start restricting focus only when it changes ... *sigh* ...
[08:18:44] <ldeluca> :)  in general though, how do we handle older devices?
[08:18:54] <ldeluca> even if you put in a fix how do we test?
[08:19:20] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: That's a good question. I'm currently trying to reproduce on browserstack.
[08:19:52] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I can ask around the office to see if anyone has such a device.
[08:21:02] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I have reproduced it on Browserstack.
[08:21:48] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Samsung Galaxy Note II (which has Android 4.1)
[08:21:54] <arschmitz> ldeluca: i have a device lab
[08:22:04] <arschmitz> i have every common device version
[08:22:24] <ldeluca> nice arschmitz!  So in the future I'll just mention you in a work item when I can't reproduce. 
[08:22:32] <arschmitz> ldeluca: we have a lab with ~35 devices
[08:22:33] <ldeluca> Is there an account for jquery mobile developers for browserstack?
[08:22:54] <arschmitz> ldeluca: we have a jquery corperate account
[08:23:01] <arschmitz> that browser stack donates
[08:23:24] <ldeluca> nice, can I use it as well? or is it limited to committers?
[08:23:51] <arschmitz> its limited to commiters i believe but i will double check to be sure
[08:24:05] <ldeluca> okay, no problem.  Thanks
[08:25:02] <arschmitz> ldeluca: no problem feel free to ping me anytime to test anything you need
[08:27:09] <scott_gonzalez> ldeluca: I can get you an account.
[08:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> ldeluca: You should have an email with an invite.
[08:28:09] <arschmitz> ldeluca: there you go that was quick :)
[08:28:48] <ldeluca> yay!  you guys are fast!
[08:45:00] <ldeluca> awesome, I'm able to reproduce the issue the person mentioned.  So what do you guys like to do as far as testing... should i upload my cordova app to github somewhere so other people can use it to reproduce easily?
[08:45:09] <ldeluca> what about youtube videos showing the error actually happening?
[08:46:15] <ldeluca> gabriel-schulhof: you mentioned one solution would be to restrict focus when it changes.  Is that something I can help fix? and if so, mind giving me some pointers on how to get started?
[08:53:44] <arschmitz> ldeluca: hey 
[08:53:57] <arschmitz> ldeluca: which issue were you looking at again
[08:54:05] <ldeluca> 7533
[08:54:34] <ldeluca> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7533
[08:54:50] <arschmitz> ok so for issues like this where there is nothing specific to cordova or phonegap going on just it being in an app
[08:55:06] <arschmitz> we try to recreate in jsbin but in a webview
[08:55:16] <arschmitz> we have an app someone made us thats just a url bar
[08:55:54] <arschmitz> so then we can go to the jsbin but in an app and reproduce play with it with out need for a seperate app for each issue
[09:00:17] <arschmitz> ldeluca: does that make sense
[09:01:12] <ldeluca> yea, makes sense
[09:01:52] <arschmitz> ldeluca: cool it does not work for all issues but for ones it does its really convenient for debugging
[09:03:28] <ldeluca> yea, i created a youtube video anyways, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnmTzKLw8ME&feature=youtube_gdata_player
[09:03:32] <ldeluca> so i'll attach it to the work item
[09:03:38] <ldeluca> but in the future I won't
[09:03:55] <arschmitz> ldeluca: cool sometimes youtube videos can be helpful 
[09:05:04] <arschmitz> ldeluca: i think i pinged you on 3 issues the other day if you finish with thoes and need more stuff too look at just ping me and ill fine more
[09:05:33] <ldeluca> so now to contribute by fixing the error!  Sounds like gabriel_schulhof might have an idea for the fix
[09:05:54] <ldeluca> yes, i saw that, thank you arschmitz.  I'm trying to reproduce them and reaching out to the people who submitted the issue to get some sample code
[09:06:02] <ldeluca> there are a lot of really old issues in here
[09:07:29] <arschmitz> ldeluca: yup
[09:07:42] <arschmitz> ldeluca: and if you find issues you think should be closed just ping me and ill close them
[09:08:14] <arschmitz> ldeluca: also note we no longer support ios < 6 and wont do any more 1.3.x releases 
[09:08:32] <arschmitz> so anything you come across thats spefic to those can no be closed
[09:09:20] <ldeluca> great, thank you!  Good to know
[09:14:40] <ldeluca> arschmitz: so something like this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4778 says jquery mobile 1.1.  So would that be closed then?  or would you ask the creator to retest with the latest version of jquery?  looks like its' 2 years old.
[09:16:03] <arschmitz> that one because its so old if its not simple to test i would close as inactive and comment if they can still reproduce the issue with latest code to comment and ill reopen 
[09:16:40] <arschmitz> if its simple to test id test real quick and then either comment its still and issue or close
[09:18:06] <ldeluca> okay, I don't have the rights to close out on issues but I will gladly comment

[10:50:45] <ldeluca> also, are button based popups allowed?  or only link based?
[10:50:50] <ldeluca> arschmitz
[11:31:13] <arschmitz> ldeluca: button is fine but you need to handle the click yourself and call open on the popup
[11:32:10] <arschmitz> an href on a button is not valid so it cant work like a link does

[12:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> It makes sense for us to support that out of the box.
