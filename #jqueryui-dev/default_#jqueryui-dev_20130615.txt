[09:57:06] <hayjoss> i'm trying to figure out a way to trick the jquery ui slider, i want it so that on value 0, the slider will return black (hsl(0, 0%, 0%)), and when it's at 360, it'll return white (hsl(360, 100%, 100%)) - here's a fiddle of the slider, http://jsfiddle.net/anpsmn/t2PDc/10/ - can't seem to figure it out
[09:57:10] <hayjoss> i want all the other colors to return as normal though
[10:44:14] <hayjoss> ahh figured it out, http://jsfiddle.net/v4wLK/1/
