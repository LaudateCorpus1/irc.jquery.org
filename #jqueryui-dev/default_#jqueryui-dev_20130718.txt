[00:00:58] <Andrew> good morning every one
[00:01:33] <Guest68811> I have found a bug in jQuery IU on http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form
[00:02:49] <Guest68811> steps: open dialog (by pressing a button), move dialog down to see scrollbar, scroll scrollbar down, move dialog down to see scrollbar, scroll scrollbar down, move dialog down to see scrollbar, scroll scrollbar down, 
[00:03:13] <Guest68811> now try to move dialog, it is moving downer then mouse cursor
[00:03:29] <Guest68811> lower* (=downer)
[00:03:36] <Guest68811> I'm using FF 20
[00:04:30] <Guest68811> same problem in IE8
[00:05:20] <Guest68811> so if window scrolled down, and you start moving dialog, it will be moved lower mouse cursor
[00:05:29] <Guest68811> any ideas?
[00:36:54] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Thanks!

[01:38:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[02:06:13] <stevesum> Hi! I have a question about jquery.ui 1.10.3. I use the autocomplete on a norwegian website, and after I switched from the 1.8.22 to this new version I found that the menu elements is not highlighted on apple devices anymore when I touch them. Perhaps this is a possible bug in the new version or just some settings problem?

[03:50:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[03:50:53] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[03:51:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was looking at visibility: hidden for ui-popup-hidden
[03:51:17] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[03:51:23] <_|Nix|_> Sounds like we don't need it.
[03:51:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that makes them inaccessible to screen readers
[03:51:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wow! That's bad ...
[03:51:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, is it not the case that they /should/ be inaccessible?
[03:52:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: After all, they're inaccessible to regular users.
[03:52:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we added it to prevent focus when you navigate with tab key and prevent selection of content when you do select all
[03:52:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good point
[03:52:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If a popup is hidden, you cannot enter text into one of its text fields. You shouldn't be able to add text to its text fields with a screen reader either.
[03:53:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thing is that screen readers can have JS enabled or disabled
[03:53:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh ...
[03:53:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think it should depend on JS or not, not on screen reader or not
[03:54:13] <_|Nix|_> OK, that's true. I guess a popup is accessible if you turn off JS, because then it's just another div somewhere down the page.
[03:54:25] <uGoMobi> right
[03:54:33] <_|Nix|_> So, we can't and shouldn't enfore inaccessibility.
[03:54:47] <_|Nix|_> Well, wait a minute.
[03:55:30] <_|Nix|_> Making a popup's contents inaccessible is part of the enhancement, but if someone wants to be PE, they need to additionally enforce the semantics in their own JS or at the server receiving the form data.
[03:56:16] <_|Nix|_> So, like, if client JS is turned off, then the user may be able to add text to a popup, but then the server needs to discard that if it's an invalid combination of inputs.
[03:56:41] <_|Nix|_> We might want to document this.
[03:57:24] <_|Nix|_> Otherwise, doing the focus management is waaay easier by turning on visibility: hidden vs. trying to instruct the focus to manually skip past the popup.
[03:57:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[03:57:51] <_|Nix|_> So, it's a tough call.
[03:58:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe we should add visibility: hidden at enhance time.
[03:58:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That way, if JS is off, then it's visible.
[03:59:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we apply the ui-popup-hidden class at enhancement time
[03:59:12] <_|Nix|_> ... but, I guess that's already happening.
[03:59:20] <_|Nix|_> Right, I just realized that.
[03:59:23] <_|Nix|_> So, we're PE.
[03:59:39] <uGoMobi> so I think we can simply use display none
[03:59:55] <uGoMobi> via a class at enhancement time that is
[04:00:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Honestly, I would prefer visiblity: hidden and no truncation, because I need to base calculations on the width/height.
[04:00:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, position: absolute; visibility: hidden.
[04:00:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't care about left and top.
[04:00:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[04:01:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but then you have to make sure it's not on top of content
[04:01:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you have position: absolute; visiblity: hidden, then it doesn't cover the top left of the document, right?
[04:01:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, really?
[04:01:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it uses space
[04:01:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It doesn't use space if it's position: absolute;
[04:01:52] <uGoMobi> if it's top left it depends on the ancestor
[04:02:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The ancestor is the page.
[04:02:16] <uGoMobi> unless the popup is outside page
[04:03:03] <uGoMobi> if you set min-width 100px for a popup and it has position absolute and visility hidden it will use space
[04:03:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You mean it will cover the content underneath it, right?
[04:03:32] <uGoMobi> right
[04:03:52] <uGoMobi> hang on, is the ui-popup-hidden class on the popup or the popup container?
[04:04:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: On the popup-container.
[04:04:57] <uGoMobi> anyways, if you want to use visibility hidden for width/height calculations you want it have width and height
[04:05:34] <uGoMobi> just don't want it to mess up layout (should not be a problem with display absolute) or be on top of something
[04:05:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly. What I don't get is this: If visibility: hidden causes content beneath to be inaccessible, then what's the difference between visibility: hidden and opacity: 0;
[04:05:41] <_|Nix|_> ?
[04:05:46] <_|Nix|_> I mean, besides the focus list.
[04:06:04] <uGoMobi> ah you are right, it shouldn't mask anything
[04:06:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so it's there, but you can still click on things behind it and highlight and focus, and type, etc. right?
[04:08:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was just double checking that
[04:09:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's a problem: They increase document width/height.
[04:09:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm right, popups can be bigger than the page
[04:10:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, if we set right: 100%; bottom: 0; They should be right above the page.
[04:10:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Meaning they won't increase document size.
[04:10:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or even right: 0; bottom: 0;
[04:11:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I suppose they can still cause a scrollbar to appear
[04:11:36] <_|Nix|_> They can? Why?
[04:11:44] <_|Nix|_> Here's what I'm thinking:
[04:11:49] <_|Nix|_> [popup]|
[04:11:50] <_|Nix|_> -------+---------- |[document]
[04:11:54] <_|Nix|_> Argh!
[04:11:57] <_|Nix|_> St00pid paste ...
[04:12:07] <_|Nix|_> [popup]|
[04:12:12] <_|Nix|_> -------+----------
[04:12:16] <_|Nix|_>        |[document]
[04:13:41] <_|Nix|_> Ooooh ... bottom: 0; right: 0; causes Chrome 28 to go nuts!
[04:14:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/edeluh/30
[04:15:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: link underneath works but you do get a scrollbar
[04:15:14] <uGoMobi> on Chrome this is
[04:15:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I know, but then how does left: -9999px; top: -9999px; work?
[04:15:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It assumes popups are smaller than 9999 px;
[04:16:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Why doesn't right: 0; bottom: 0; work?
[04:16:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: right: 0; means that no matter how big the popup, the left coordinate will be -width and the right coordinate will be 0;
[04:16:42] <_|Nix|_> Right?
[04:19:06] <_|Nix|_> Oh, sorry ... I need right: 100%, correct?
[04:19:30] <_|Nix|_> Crap, and that's no good, because there's still the margin.
[04:19:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you would have a 99999px widht popup top/left: -9999px would show same issue
[04:20:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah it just means it's positioned 0 px from the right side of the containing block
[04:20:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, and right: 100%?
[04:21:19] <_|Nix|_> I think that would stick it in the left margin, wouldn't it?
[04:21:38] <_|Nix|_> Or we could go with right: 200% ...
[04:22:36] <_|Nix|_> Oh, wait ... wrong ... that's no good either, because if it's wider than the page, it still pokes in.
[04:22:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right 100% mean 100% of the containing block width
[04:22:56] <_|Nix|_> This sucks! There should be a way of saying 100% of yourself.
[04:23:53] <_|Nix|_> So is there no way of aligning the right edge of the popup with the left edge of the container?
[04:25:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not really 
[04:25:48] <_|Nix|_> I think right: 100% will do that. right: 50% places the right edge of the popup into the middle of the window.
[04:26:09] <_|Nix|_> So right: 100% will place the right edge of the popup to the left of the windwo.
[04:27:08] <_|Nix|_> Yeah: I just set the width of the NYC popup to 4000px, and the right edge is still in the middle of the window.
[04:28:22] <_|Nix|_> I think right: 100%; bottom: 100%; should work.
[04:29:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: makes sense now I think of it
[04:29:29] <_|Nix|_> ... as long as the container has the width/height of the document.
[04:29:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: makes me curious why this isn't used for a11y solutions
[04:29:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No idea.
[04:30:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll set it to 200%, and we can accomodate a wide range of things sticking out of the popup to the right (such as close buttons).
[04:30:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean I'll set right: 200%; bottom: 200%;
[04:31:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: As long as the thing sticking out of the popup is no wider than the popup itself ...
[04:31:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but that would be ridiculous layout.
[04:31:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah agreed
[04:32:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for some reason I have the feeling there is something I don't think of
[04:32:47] <_|Nix|_> Well, if you get that feeling, imagine me. This is very, very thin ice for me.
[04:32:54] <uGoMobi> haha
[04:33:04] <_|Nix|_> Either way, here's what I have so far:
[04:33:06] <_|Nix|_> .ui-popup-hidden { position: absolute !important; bottom: 200%; right: 200%; visibility: hidden;
[04:33:09] <_|Nix|_> }
[04:33:25] <_|Nix|_> Grrr! Why does it eat carriage returns?!
[04:34:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe add overflow: hidden... things that stick out should add to the popup width/height anyway, right?
[04:34:26] <uGoMobi> then you could reduce the 200%
[04:34:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Man - doesn't help. It still twitches!
[04:34:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: :/
[04:34:54] <_|Nix|_> I don't get it. Really ... WTF?!
[04:35:04] <_|Nix|_> I don't understand why it twitches!
[04:47:07] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... if I reposition before removing ui-popup-hidden, it doesn't twitch, but the placement is wrong ... I wonder why. After all, the width/height should be the same.
[04:51:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you should use top: -200% instead of bottom
[04:52:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[04:53:33] <_|Nix|_> Wait, no. I don't want the top coordinate to be -200% of the container, because then the bottom coordinate can still be inside the container.
[04:53:41] <_|Nix|_> I don't want to refer to top and left at all.
[04:54:25] <_|Nix|_> So, if the container is x, and the popup is 2x + 150; then setting top: -200% will cause the bottom 50px of the popup to be inside the container.
[04:54:42] <_|Nix|_> I mean the bottom 150px.
[04:54:48] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[04:54:58] <uGoMobi> but bottom will add height to the document
[04:55:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This is working, except the text wraps when the coordinates are weird.
[04:56:23] <_|Nix|_> No, because it refers to where to put the bottom of the element. Not the bottom of the container.
[04:56:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: interesting... when an element with visibility has height/width it can get focus on Chrome, if no height/width/clip is 1px it can't get focus
[04:56:54] <_|Nix|_> Oh no!
[04:56:55] <uGoMobi> s/if no/if/
[04:57:01] <_|Nix|_> So, even visibility: hidden can get focus?
[04:57:08] <uGoMobi> yup
[04:57:21] <_|Nix|_> Well, fsck!
[04:57:39] <_|Nix|_> This bloweth :(
[04:57:51] <_|Nix|_> So, we're back to square 0.
[04:58:00] <_|Nix|_> We must truncate :(
[04:59:19] <_|Nix|_> OK, in that case, I definitely need two classes. One to remove the truncation and the second to remove the visibility after I have calculated the final location.
[04:59:48] <_|Nix|_> So, -> .removeClass( "ui-popup-truncate" ); this._reposition(); .removeClass( "ui-popup-hidden" );
[05:01:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we have similar issue with panels
[05:02:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because we need to know the height of the panel content
[05:05:48] <_|Nix|_> OK. We have a problem on master. There are two scrollbars on the popup demo page.
[05:06:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes I know
[05:07:02] <_|Nix|_> We must set right: >= 100%; top: >= 100%; for it to work.
[05:07:06] <_|Nix|_> I set 200% for both.
[05:07:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's because of overflow-x hidden on page
[05:07:11] <_|Nix|_> ... and then it works.
[05:07:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the second scrollbar is because of panel page content wrapper
[05:08:03] <uGoMobi> in ext-panels we remove that wrapper
[05:08:09] <uGoMobi> and the problem will be gone
[05:08:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so you're saying I shouldn't add the right: 200%; bottom: 200%; to .ui-popup-hidden?
[05:09:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can get rid of the panels from that page just to test without panels.
[05:09:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we shouldn't use bottom 200%
[05:10:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: would it be a problem to just use top:-9999px and left:-9999px
[05:10:59] <uGoMobi> ?
[05:11:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It would be if one of the dimensions of the popup is > 10kpx.
[05:11:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[05:11:46] <_|Nix|_> Although we do truncate.
[05:11:47] <uGoMobi> I think that developer has a bigger issue
[05:12:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but right/bottom: 100% (at least) is a guarantee that no matter how big the popup, it's bottom corner will never overlap the document.
[05:12:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Truncated or not.
[05:12:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, right 100% seem to work
[05:13:09] <_|Nix|_> It basically aligns the bottom right corner of the popup to the top left corner of the container.
[05:13:15] <uGoMobi> just not sure why it is never mentioned/used in posts about a11y
[05:13:27] <_|Nix|_> No idea.
[05:13:57] <_|Nix|_> Well, maybe because there's no guarantee that the width/height of the container === the width/height of the document.
[05:14:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I think bottom 100% will increase document height
[05:14:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, because if you set bottom: 100% on the popup container, the popup will be located above y = 0.
[05:14:48] <_|Nix|_> That is, it will be entirely in y < 0 space.
[05:14:54] <uGoMobi> the reason I use the truncate technique instead of -9999px is that the latter will cause an issue with dir="rtl"
[05:16:19] <_|Nix|_> OK, so basically, I need to briefly un-truncate the popup before it becomes visible, so I can measure it and place it correctly.
[05:16:50] <_|Nix|_> When I un-truncate the popup, it needs to be at reasonable coordinates, or else the text will wrap.
[05:20:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't believe the two scrollbars are because of panels.
[05:20:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They're because of the missing -9999px.
[05:20:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Look at http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/tmp.html
[05:21:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Totally simple page - no panels, nothing.
[05:21:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yet it has two scrollbars.
[05:21:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or wait, are you saying you can only remove that overflow-x from page once the panels are ready to deal with that?
[05:21:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That is, once ext-panels can be merged?
[05:22:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm overflow-x hidden is causing it
[05:22:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, even on pages that have no panels?
[05:22:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but it was supposed to stay
[05:22:18] <uGoMobi> right
[05:22:36] <tj_vantoll> Do we have an official stance on bugs in unreleased browser versions? Someone reported an IE11 bug (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9434) and I'm not exactly sure what to do with it.
[05:22:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I thought it was only an issue when you have a panel page with wrapper
[05:22:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, then the only change is the removal of the crazy left/top coords from popup.
[05:22:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nope.
[05:23:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Totally normal page has it too.
[05:23:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see that now
[05:23:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but only with crazy coords right?
[05:23:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Only without crazy coords!
[05:24:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If I put left/top: -9999px back into .ui-popup-hidden, there is no second scrollbar.
[05:24:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think the second scrollbar appears because the parent of the popup container (the page) is one px taller than the body.
[05:25:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah must be something like that
[05:25:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The one px caused by the width/height/clip of ui-popup-hidden.
[05:25:23] <uGoMobi> oh wait
[05:25:33] <uGoMobi> I can set a -1px margin
[05:25:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If we were to set with/height/clip to 0px, then the second scrollbar would disappear, IMO.
[05:25:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, good.
[05:25:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lemme test that
[05:26:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: WORKSFORME.
[05:26:40] <_|Nix|_> Now, popups officially take up no space.
[05:26:47] <_|Nix|_> ... while hidden./
[05:28:02] <_|Nix|_> Argh! But they still twitch!
[05:28:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, margin: -1px; seems to do the trick
[05:28:09] <uGoMobi> ohwww
[05:28:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I don't get why. On the simple page they don't twitch, but on the demo page they do.
[05:29:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you define "twitch" for me?
[05:29:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: don't really see what you mean
[05:29:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 1. scroll to bottom; 2. Click on a popup-opening button;
[05:29:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: At this point, the page jumps 3px away from the bottom; When you close the popup, it jumps back to the bottom.
[05:30:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: which browser?
[05:30:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Chrome 28.
[05:30:27] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:32:39] <_|Nix|_> Damn! I had a fix for it, and now it's gone!
[05:33:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I really don't see it
[05:34:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You saw it in FF last time.
[05:34:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, the fix is to add left: 0; top: 0; to ui-popup-hidden
[05:34:36] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15phpmycoder opened issue #6185: Ajax loading doesn't resolve duplicate ID conflicts  02http://git.io/tOvuuQ
[05:34:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Which sounds bad, but remember that it also gets ui-popup-truncate, a new class which does the truncation.
[05:35:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I always add/remove ui-popup-hidden and ui-popup-truncate together, except when I'm about to show the popup.
[05:35:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I see it on FF
[05:35:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, wait. That is bad. ui-popup-truncate must override left: 0; top: 0;
[05:37:16] <_|Nix|_> Wait, no it's not bad, because when ui-popup-truncate is on, it's OK if the popup is at 0, 0, because it takes up no space.
[05:37:59] <_|Nix|_> If I remove ui-popup-truncate, all of a sudden the popup is as wide as it's gonna be and as tall as it's gonna be, but only for a moment, because I position it and set max-size in the same frame.
[05:38:14] <_|Nix|_> I mean max-width, not max-size.
[05:38:24] <_|Nix|_> I do that with inline CSS.
[05:38:45] <_|Nix|_> ... and visibility is still hidden when I do that.
[05:38:53] <_|Nix|_> ... so it shouldn't flicker.
[05:40:45] <_|Nix|_> The only problem is that now there is another reflow :(
[05:43:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm :(
[05:44:05] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gabrielschulhof created 06popup-no-twitch (+1 new commit): 02http://git.io/67UQVQ
[05:44:05] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06popup-no-twitch 14e1b9d32 15Gabriel Schulhof: Popup: Do not twitch on Chrome 28 when opening a popup near the bottom of the document.
[05:44:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was this an issue in 1.3 or did I introduce the problem by changing ui-popup-hidden CSS?
[05:44:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's find out.
[05:45:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, I pushed that branch. Can you popen the corresponding view.jquerymobile.com page and check if you still see the twitch in FF?
[05:45:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You shouldn't.
[05:45:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[05:45:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The twitch is there, even in 1.3.1: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/demos/widgets/popup/
[05:45:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So this may be a regression with the newer Chrome.
[05:47:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If it fixes it for you, I'll merge/delete the branch.
[05:47:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, will let you know as soon as the branch is on view
[05:47:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: so something is either broken badly in master or jsbin is very broken
[05:48:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Try this in the meantime: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/demos/widgets/popup/
[05:48:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do URL.
[05:48:26] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/908/edit
[05:48:35] <arschmitz> click page 2 then click page one
[05:48:43] <arschmitz> everything is escaped
[05:48:54] <arschmitz> and it shows hidden chars
[05:48:55] <_|Nix|_> Dafuq?!
[05:49:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: problem is gone on FF with your test page
[05:49:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can say the same thing about Chrome 28.
[05:50:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I'll push that.
[05:50:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think I know the cause of that
[05:50:48] <arschmitz> ??
[05:50:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: gseguin|away pushed a commit
[05:50:58] <uGoMobi> one sec
[05:51:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's unfortunate about the new class and the extra reflow, but what can you do?
[05:51:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7acdb8e856d0fd714ae651cc5f7045d4124214fc
[05:51:49] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Ghislain Seguin (20h 40m ago): Normalized line endings
[05:51:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can't think of another way to remove the style added by the old ui-popup-hidden in two steps.
[05:52:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: neither can I at the moment
[05:52:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont think thats it
[05:53:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The only one-step solution would've been to not truncate, but if that leaves the hidden stuff focusable, then it's of no use to us.
[05:53:34] <arschmitz> thats only toolbars and just changing the line endings in the source
[05:53:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How come that's not happening in the demos?
[05:54:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im thinking its jsbin
[05:54:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Gotta be.
[05:54:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe I changed our JS Bin tempate on Windows
[05:54:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Try jsfiddle for comparison.
[05:54:27] <uGoMobi> not sure
[05:54:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, uzaret is pretty old.
[05:54:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nah thats an old one i still use because its bookmarked and i remeber the slug
[05:54:53] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[05:54:57] <_|Nix|_> It's two templates back, but, of course, if arschmitz updated the links in the HEAD, it doesn't matter.
[05:55:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: latest is latest only real change is the jquery version
[05:55:18] <arschmitz> its still on 1.8
[05:55:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *shrug* ... try changing that too, for completeness?
[05:56:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: point though is only thing that can change is jsbin itself or jqm
[05:56:40] <arschmitz> because jquery has not changed and the template has not changed
[05:57:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Does the new template work?
[05:57:20] <arschmitz> no idea
[05:57:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait - I'm an idioyt.
[05:57:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's the same thing.
[05:58:20] <uGoMobi> I am trying to test the same thing in JSFiddle
[05:58:58] <uGoMobi> where do you have to put the head on JSFiddle? :/
[05:59:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No idea. I think if you stick the whole thing inside the HTML portion then you should be fine.
[06:00:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nah, I get warnings about it already being included
[06:00:09] <_|Nix|_> It's so st00pid how jsfiddle separates things out.
[06:00:38] <_|Nix|_> Great ... better off just testing locally :(
[06:01:01] <uGoMobi> yeah, I don't understand why JSFiddle does that either
[06:02:03] <arschmitz> jsfiddle works fine
[06:02:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : I can reproduce on JS Fiddle but that's probably because I copy and paste the markup
[06:02:05] <arschmitz> its jsbin
[06:02:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you can??
[06:02:19] <arschmitz> i cant
[06:02:31] <uGoMobi> http://jsfiddle.net/tBjv9/
[06:02:35] <_|Nix|_> Funny :)
[06:03:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol you didnt change the lings
[06:03:05] <arschmitz> so its loading jsbin
[06:03:11] <arschmitz> :)
[06:04:17] <arschmitz> http://jsfiddle.net/XNYWM/6/show
[06:04:27] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I just noticed that too :)
[06:04:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what do you mean?
[06:04:35] <arschmitz> ignore the fact that the link always says page one
[06:04:38] <uGoMobi> loading JSBin?
[06:04:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The link on the jsfiddle page points to jsbin
[06:04:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that was doing ajax page load
[06:04:48] <uGoMobi> ahhh
[06:05:09] <_|Nix|_> Wait a second - that should fail. Isn't that cross-origin?
[06:05:22] <arschmitz> first time loads identical page non ajax on jsbin
[06:05:31] <arschmitz> second time is ajax to other jsbin
[06:05:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, OK, so it's HTTP.
[06:05:47] <_|Nix|_> NM.
[06:06:08] <arschmitz> so the issue is jsbin for some reason :(
[06:06:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is the broken template doing AJAX to reach page two?
[06:06:50] <arschmitz> its just a regular link
[06:06:56] <arschmitz> so if its same domain its ajax
[06:07:05] <arschmitz> if its not its regular http
[06:07:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, so jsbin is serving up bad stuff over AJAX.
[06:07:16] <arschmitz> right
[06:07:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe it's serving up JSON?
[06:07:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... instead of HTML?
[06:07:58] <arschmitz> no then there would be all sorts of brackets
[06:08:01] <arschmitz> and braces
[06:08:33] <arschmitz> oh actually your right
[06:08:43] <arschmitz> its serving an ajax object
[06:09:20] <arschmitz> with html,javascript,css,created,last_updated,permalink, and processors properties
[06:09:26] <arschmitz> i mean json object
[06:10:21] <arschmitz> ok so better start looking for new solution for issues
[06:12:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, man, that's bad ... 
[06:12:41] <arschmitz> maybe we can submit an issue to them?
[06:12:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But this is only for non-internal pages ... jsbin is still good for single-page issues.
[06:13:07] <arschmitz> right but we need something for people reporting ajax issues
[06:13:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, maybe we don't do the right thing in NAV.
[06:13:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we need to request HTML.
[06:13:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think $.ajax has a dataType option.
[06:13:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wonder if that helps.
[06:13:44] <arschmitz> yes its what to expect
[06:13:49] <arschmitz> you cant request anything
[06:13:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm :(
[06:13:58] <arschmitz> you get what ever the url returns
[06:14:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but can't you pass some header along with your request?
[06:14:37] <arschmitz> possibly but the server would have to expect and consume that header
[06:15:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, of course. I'm just saying, maybe we missed some part of the convention.
[06:15:27] * _|Nix|_ is wet-behind-the-ears on this front.
[06:16:05] <arschmitz> nope

[06:17:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there was an update to jsbin yesterday
[06:18:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd say it's a breaking change.
[06:20:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do you think I shall take on removing optionDemultiplexer from dialog?
[06:21:04] <_|Nix|_> s/shall/should/
[06:21:55] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... Are we going to grab a new version of the widget factory before we release?
[06:22:26] <_|Nix|_> There's a change in there for which I could remove the workaround from our base class.
[06:27:07] <arschmitz> yes we should
[06:27:26] <arschmitz> we will be swaping again right after alpha too
[06:27:42] <arschmitz> when i make the change for autoinit
[06:28:09] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: wants me to make the change in our copy first then once its working widget factory will get update
[06:30:51] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: As soon as you know it will work, I'll land it.
[06:31:06] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if you've already gotten to the point where you know it's working.
[06:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, we want this change for AMD anyway.
[06:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> So that we can just do `return $.widget( ... )`
[06:32:24] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah iv been following that issue
[06:32:50] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and no iv been to busy trying to clean up some widgets that needs to be done before alpha
[06:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, no problem. AMD isn't going to land in the next few days anyway.

[06:36:23] <tj_vantoll> UNreleased browser versions that is.
[06:37:03] <scott_gonzalez> I think our policy is that pre-releases aren't officially supported.
[06:37:15] <scott_gonzalez> But we should try to verify.

[07:47:56] <frequent> lemme try
[07:50:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: YOu ask in IRC.
[07:50:24] <frequent> what did I ask?
[07:50:55] <frequent> sorry...
[07:51:24] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I'm telling uGoMobi that, if google docs were to allow you to give write permission to "Anonymous Gopher" after identifying that person in an independent channel then that would be a nice feature.

[08:42:54] <johnbender> ok cool
[08:42:57] <johnbender> that's more what I meant

[08:45:06] <uGoMobi> hey johnbender
[08:45:35] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I am not sure if arschmitz merged content widget already
[08:45:49] <uGoMobi> but we were planning on it
[08:46:06] <uGoMobi> still need to update all documentation for 1.4
[08:46:06] <arschmitz> yes its merged
[08:46:17] <arschmitz> and no i dont think it should be public for 1.4
[08:46:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, thanks

[10:31:07] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, thanks for letting me know
[10:59:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is there any point in implementing _destroy() for dialog? It seems to me like, if it's internal, it will be enhanced once, and then it'll stick around until the document is unloaded. Otherwise, it'll get AJAX-ed in, and it will either stick around until the document gets unloaded (if it's set to be retained) otherwise it'll be removed from the DOM anyway.
[10:59:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no but not because of that
[10:59:44] <uGoMobi> also note that we want to make dialog an option of page
[10:59:46] <arschmitz> because dialog as a stand alone widget is deprecated
[10:59:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. OK.
[10:59:59] <arschmitz> so not point in spending time adding methods
[11:00:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but dialog has a bunch of options of its own. How will that jive with page?
[11:00:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like closeBtn and closeBtnText ...
[11:01:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Those are only relevant if the dialog option is set.
[11:01:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: closebtn = backbtn
[11:01:36] <arschmitz> if page = dialog
[11:02:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... and is there *BtnText?
[11:02:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its not done yet so not sure where this will all land
[11:02:59] <arschmitz> but the dialog widget as a whole is being deprecated
[11:03:15] <arschmitz> and you will just have the option to style you page as a dialog
[11:03:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'm totally down with that.

[11:40:06] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Ignore my comment on your API issue...
[11:40:12] <scott_gonzalez> I completley misunderstood.
[11:40:24] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: NP.
[11:40:42] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: You can always delete it *shrug*
[11:41:21] <scott_gonzalez> You're saying that the options should become ui, correct?
[11:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: ^
[11:42:52] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I'm not actually sure, now that you mention it. I seek to pass an additional object to the handlers, and I do that with 		this._trigger( "beforeposition", undefined, opts );
[11:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> That parameter is always called ui in the docs.
[11:43:20] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That results in the handler having arguments ( event, options ), no?
[11:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but examples are always ( event, ui )
[11:44:02] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OKOK, but "ui" is misleading, because the parameter named "ui" contains no ... "ui".
[11:44:05] <_|Nix|_> It contains options.
[11:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> We can change it to something like "data".
[11:44:28] <_|Nix|_> In particular: { positionTo: "something", x: number, y: number }
[11:44:50] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, that'd be good.
[11:44:59] <arschmitz> data makes more sense then options
[11:45:07] <arschmitz> because they are not really options often in ui
[11:45:16] <scott_gonzalez> It'll require going through every UI and Mobile widget entry though.
[11:45:30] <arschmitz> yup and thats a fair bit
[11:46:56] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I guess ui is fine for now.
[11:47:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I can re-word the docs to indicate that the ui parameter contains the options.
[11:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> That would work.
[11:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> I pinged others to get feedback on changing to `data`.
[11:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> I think that change would be fine.
[11:47:59] <scott_gonzalez> I always thought the `ui` name was odd.
[11:48:02] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i think it makes sense the way its generally used
[11:48:13] <arschmitz> data that is
[11:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> When I wrote ._trigger(), I even named the parameter data.
[11:49:21] <scott_gonzalez> The `ui` convention existed before that in all of our demos, tests and docs.
[11:56:23] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The phrase " ... for historical reasons ... " comes to mind :)
