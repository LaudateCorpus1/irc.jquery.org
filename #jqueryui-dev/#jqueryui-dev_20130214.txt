[06:04:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: this._superApply( arguments ) safe?
[06:05:04] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:05:53] <gnarf> and destroy didn't need a super yeah?
[06:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[06:06:05] <gnarf> create as well?
[06:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> Well, _destroy() doesn't need a super.
[06:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> Old school destroy
[06:06:18] <scott_gonzalez> would
[06:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> _create() also doesn't need super, unless you're inheriting.
[06:07:03] <scott_gonzalez> If you're inheriting from another widget (not $.Widget), then you should call super for create and destroy.
[06:07:18] <gnarf> _create / _destroy?
[06:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> Since you'll want the parent's creation and destruction to occur.
[07:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Looks like the generated themes still don't have the progressbar overlay image.
[07:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> For the generate_themes task.
[07:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> But the new config setup did seem to work :-)
[08:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: testing meeting
[09:00:36] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ah, builder adds overlay, but themeroller only generates the theme-related images. :/
[09:01:00] <rxaviers> Will fix that
[09:01:56] <rxaviers> Ideally, download builder API should handle this instead of letting grunt task do it.
[10:28:27] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, one question https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/9bac5bb54ab602b3b3a2f5a0d41cdd043e8fb85c#commitcomment-2624786
[10:28:30] <b-ot> rxaviers: JÃ¶rn Zaefferer (5mon 2d 12m 25s): Grunt: New task for downloading themes using new themeroller.  * Replaces the old theme tasks with generate_themes. * Drops useless download_docs task * Drops request module
[10:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: They should already be converted. The reason they're not is because you started using the source instead of the dist directory.
[10:33:25] <scott_gonzalez> See https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/0ae725d4320ed7510c390d0ca988ac02896f5ee5#L0L189
[10:33:26] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Rafael Xavier de Souza (21h 36m 50s): Grunt: update generate_themes task to use new DownloadBuilder API  - DownloadBuilder accepts the config file as an option. It's not necessary   to workaround it by changing the DownloadBuilder config file anymore; - DownloadBuilder has exposed a different method to generate the gallery:   download.themegallery(), instead of frontend.download.themegallery(); - Changed theme.fetchImages -> theme.generateIm
[10:35:58] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Im asking because we're replicating what builder does in this task and I want use Builder to help here.
[10:36:31] <rxaviers> But, I want to double check if we get the same thing of  `css/<theme>` from the downloaded package or not.
[10:36:39] <rxaviers> I just used that commit as a reference to show de code.
[10:39:46] <scott_gonzalez> No, it's different.
[10:39:56] <rxaviers> what's diff?
[10:40:43] <scott_gonzalez> Each theme dir contains jquery-ui.css (full) + jquery.ui.theme.css (vars replaced) + images directory
[10:41:05] <scott_gonzalez> NOTE: We do want to add the minified file.
[10:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> But current builds don't have it.
[10:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> So the difference is the file name and the inclusion of jquery.ui.theme.css
[10:42:28] <rxaviers> excellent, thanks
[10:43:09] <rxaviers> checking if this can be obtained by `development-bundle/themes/<theme>`
[11:11:24] <rxaviers> jquery.ui.theme.css diff https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/4955409, ok it's due an update in DB, where it outputs the unzipped url again, not the zipped.
[11:14:45] <rxaviers> jquery-ui.cs diff https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/4955345, < is that ok? seems like bundle themes used a different version of this CSS file which a) had the order of some styles modified, b) does not include the themeroller url yet.
[11:15:20] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ^ (one line above)
[11:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know why the order of resizable changes?
[11:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: ^
[11:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> Also, can we drop the "(c) in the copyright notice?
[11:49:09] <rxaviers> I will double check, but I think because the category order
[11:49:15] <rxaviers> of* the
[11:49:21] <rxaviers> sure
[11:49:35] <rxaviers> on all banners?
[11:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:51:56] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, because resizable is the only interaction with CSS.
[11:52:16] <rxaviers> is that ok? do you wanna it in alphab order?
[11:52:37] <scott_gonzalez> It should be fine how it is.
[11:52:49] <rxaviers> ok
[11:52:59] <scott_gonzalez> I was just curious.
[11:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it was from the cateogries, but I couldn't figure out why only resizable moved and not all other interactions.
[11:53:22] <jquicommit> [13download.jqueryui.com] 15rxaviers opened issue #107: Drop the "(c) in the copyright notice" of all banners  02http://git.io/kv8F3g
[11:53:23] <scott_gonzalez> But then I remembered that nothing else has CSS.
[11:53:43] <scott_gonzalez> So, yes, this change is fine.
[11:53:58] <rxaviers> cool ok
[11:54:12] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll get jquery-ui.css, jquery-ui.min.js and jquery.ui.theme.css?
[11:54:33] <rxaviers> Not necessarily the min, only if you want it
[11:54:45] <rxaviers> currently, we dont have the min
[11:54:48] <rxaviers> right
[11:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> right
[11:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> It's a feature request: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8614
[11:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> So if it's easy, let's do it.
[11:55:14] <rxaviers> ah ok
[11:55:17] <scott_gonzalez> If not, we can hold off.
[11:55:18] <rxaviers> sure it is
[11:55:30] <scott_gonzalez> :-)

[12:11:56] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, this is what Im planning to get https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/db106
[12:13:53] <scott_gonzalez> `doneOnFailure( err )` seems bad
[12:14:00] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you continuing to process if there's an error?
[12:14:12] <rxaviers> ah! I forgot the return
[12:14:29] <rxaviers> ok, I'd like to get rid of the duplicate if's
[12:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> Needs a conditional too.
[12:14:38] <rxaviers> but, the duplicate if's is better
[12:14:45] <scott_gonzalez> You can't get rid of the duplicate ifs.
[12:14:50] <rxaviers> yeap
[12:14:52] <rxaviers> fixing it
[12:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> At least not without using a for-real helper.
[12:15:48] <scott_gonzalez> The next() call shouldn't be inside the try{}
[12:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> try { grunt... } catch( error ) { return next( error ); } next();
