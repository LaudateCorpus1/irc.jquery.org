[12:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> can anyone reproduce this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7837
[12:32:27] <bot-t> (21 hours 40 mins ago) <Dave_Stein> tell scott_gonzalez is there a reason widget doesn't cache this.body like it does for document and window? A lot of the widgets just straight append to body don't they?
[12:37:20] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'm glad they provided a fiddle. :P have you built a test? I am on win 7 so if not i will try to make one based on the description
[12:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell Dave_Stein maybe, we can look into adding this.body
[12:38:17] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[12:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I just adding a console.log( ui.value ) to the default slider demo
[12:38:41] <scott_gonzalez> inside the slide event
[12:38:55] <kborchers> ok, i'll take a look
[12:44:22] <scott_gonzalez> you can just run $( "#slider" ).slider({ slide: function( event, ui ) { console.log( "slide", ui.value ); }, stop: function( event, ui ) { console.log( "stop", ui.value ); } });
[12:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> against http://view.jqueryui.com/branches/1-8-stable/demos/slider/default.html
[12:45:15] <kborchers> yeah ... i have tried a number of things and it works for me in both FF and Chrome on Win7
[12:45:23] <kborchers> can't reproduce
[12:45:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok, thanks
[12:47:20] <kborchers> you can reference this in a response if you want so you have a working example to point at http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/WGkZN/
[12:48:05] <scott_gonzalez> already closed :-P
[12:48:15] <kborchers> heh ok
