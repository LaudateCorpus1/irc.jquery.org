[05:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Did you see the ticket about .finish()?
[06:04:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I ran a jsperf of dialog vs. popup instantiation. Unsurprisingly, popup came out on top by a factor of 6-7. Unsurprisingly, because dialog generates a pile more divs than popup. Nevertheless, I'm wondering whether the use case where a popup is used as a dialog is widespread enough to warrant the loss of performance. Also, how often is a popup used like this: http://jsbin.com/gobaco/3/? I'm thinking dialog would be overkill 
[06:04:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: IOW, I've been thinking a bit about the transition from popup to dialog.
[06:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> A factor of 6-7 (i.e., relative comparisons) are meaningless.
[06:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> How fast can a dialog be created and what's the max we expect at a time?
[06:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> Note that I"m not saying anything about whether dialog shoud replace popup in specific situations, just that we have to stop talking about all these perf comparisons the wrong way.
[06:13:48] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: They're both slow. This is not a measly fraction of a millisecond: http://jsperf.com/dialog-vs-popup/
[06:15:38] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: ... and the use cases they cover are different, too. A dialog is a more substantial UI than a popup, yet a popup is more substantial than a tooltip.
[06:16:17] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: So, that's why I'm more interested in whether it's justified to drop the non-dialog use cases. Maybe a dialog is like, 99.9% of the popup's usage, in which case it totally makes sense to switch to dialog wholesale.
[06:17:16] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the words popup and dialog have completley different meanings to me.
[06:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> And likely to the entire UI team.
[06:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> Considering we experimented with a popup widget and it was very differnet than dialog.
[06:18:06] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: The fact is, though, that the mechanics of both are very similar, i.e. absolute placement with a modal overlay.
[06:18:19] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and an open/close lifecycle.
[06:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> A popup to me is not modal.
[06:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> For example, the menu in an autocomplete or a select is a popup.
[06:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> While they have open and close lifecycles, they don't have close buttons, they don't trap focus, etc.
[06:19:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess in mobile we use the word popup differently. Ours is more of a dialog.
[06:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> I dialog is self contained, it has a title, etc.
[06:20:28] <gabriel_schulhof> ... except it's totally stripped down - no close button, no title bar, no buttons of any kind. I mean, you can add all that, but that's your business.
[06:20:51] <scott_gonzalez> They are semantically different and should be treated as such.
[06:21:19] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: OK, then just out of curiosity, what, if anything, would you call the widget we call a "popup"?
[06:21:23] <gabriel_schulhof> ... in mobile?
[06:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'd say it's a convoluted popup :-P
[06:22:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, yeah. We originally called it a "popupwindow" in Web UI Framework, but then, when we moved it to jQuery Mobile, we shortened the name to popup.
[06:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> It has too many concerns, like modality, history, etc.
[06:23:09] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Oh, definitely. It could use some breaking up into extensions.
[06:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> I would not replace this with UI dialog.
[06:23:17] <gabriel_schulhof> That's part of the nav revamp.
[06:24:55] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: What about breaking up dialog into two extensions: A base which provides the mechanics of having the modal overlay and the absolutely placed element above that, and an extension which adds the semantics, as it were: The title bar, the close button, the button area, the draggable, and resizable?
[06:26:05] <scott_gonzalez> That would basically bring us back to $.blockUI(). Do you have a proposal for what the APIs would look like?
[06:26:07] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Considering that we'll excise the nav from all our mobile widgets, the base could basically serve as the mobile popup, with maybe an extension for automatic repositioning in response to orientationchange, which would be mobile-specific.
[06:26:32] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: No, but I'd be willing to work on it if we had some consensus that my work would not be wasted.
[06:26:45] <gabriel_schulhof> In fact, I'd love to work on that.
[06:29:08] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and, of course, depending on what arschmitz's take is on the whole thing.
[06:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> We can't have consensus of that up front.
[06:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'm also pretty sure we've gone down this road multiple times.
[06:31:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. That's understandable. OK. I'll try to come up with something, but my basic approach would be to leave the dialog widget API completely unchanged, except that the implementation of the options would be partitioned between the base and the extension.
[06:34:43] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: There's a document for making such proposals, right? Can you please link me to it?
[06:39:08] <scott_gonzalez> We use wiki.jqueryui.com for planning.
[06:40:29] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Thanks!

[11:45:58] <sfrisk> Awesome, thank you!
[11:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> It was actually DaveMethvin and RWhitbeck that got it updated. "How many jQuery developers does it take to update a calendar?"
[11:48:40] <sfrisk> The answer is: a lot

[13:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> sfrisk arschmitz: I just created #css-chassis
[13:08:15] <sfrisk> okay
[13:08:19] <arschmitz> cool
[13:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> Now that we have a name, we can have a proper channel :-)
[13:09:33] <arschmitz> should probably change the topic in #jquery-meeting too
[13:09:37] <arschmitz> to add the meeting 
[13:13:24] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Message too large to be sent :-(
[13:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> Can't add another meeting to the topic.
[13:13:51] <arschmitz> hmm maybe we should reconsider how we are doing the topic in general then
[13:40:50] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: We should probably just link to http://meetings.jquery.org/ and then get links to the appropriate docs somewhere on that site.
[14:01:43] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah thats what i was thinking actually
