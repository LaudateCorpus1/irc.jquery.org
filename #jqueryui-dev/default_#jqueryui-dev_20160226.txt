[11:26:35] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez arschmitz: The jQuery UI - git core job has been failing (on npm install) for some time, are you aware of that?
[11:27:01] <m_gol> compare http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/1100/consoleFull to http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.11.x%20core/151/consoleFull
[11:27:34] <m_gol> this is weird as it fails on `npm install` where it shouldn't yet matter what Core version is being used...
[11:33:42] <m_gol> ok, cleaning up node_modules manually helped: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/1101/consoleFull
[11:41:09] <jzaefferer> thanks m_gol!
[11:41:31] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: re menu bug, monday? Any specific time (or day) that works best for you?
