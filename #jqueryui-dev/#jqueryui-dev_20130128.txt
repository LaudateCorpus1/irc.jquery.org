[06:44:02] <djQuery> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8203
[06:44:17] <djQuery> 'text' is a confusing name for the option
[06:44:50] <djQuery> wouldnt we need to go through every ui component and change the to use the new option?
[06:45:10] <djQuery> and then build tests for each
[06:53:05] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: Yes, that's the case for all API changes.
[06:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> Though "every ui component" is like 1 or 2.
[06:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> Most widgets don't use button.
[07:02:16] <djQuery> oh well need to do 5454 first anyway

[10:33:27] <rxaviers> clarkbox seems to be away. Does anyone else know how to build queries in splunk willing to give a hand?
[11:34:54] <jquicommit> [13download.jqueryui.com] 15tablatronix opened issue #87: builder scope issue, tab content borders  02http://git.io/kP9CZg
[13:33:24] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I've summarized the needed changes to fix the issue there.. Time permitting I fix that.
[13:34:26] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, I've added some more charts on splunk. It gives us the view of downloads per version.
[13:34:58] <rxaviers> It shows the drop of legacy versions downloads.
[13:35:35] <rxaviers> - it's very clear that downloads have more high traffic during weekdays;
[13:36:22] <rxaviers> - when new versions are live, there's no clear peak. The curves seems to follow its course.
[13:37:24] <rxaviers> will let you know when I have a first draft of the DB post
[13:44:56] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, do we track the number of "Quick Downloads" downloads?
[13:51:44] <rxaviers> brb in 30min
[15:52:47] <mikesherov> almost done with v0.0.1 of the effects rewrite
[15:52:53] <mikesherov> gnarf: ^
[15:53:02] <mikesherov> just transfer is left
[15:55:29] <clarkbox> rxaviers: those stats from the "download builder" index do not include the "quick" downloads (unless the quick download gets a "custom" build on demand? but i doubt it)
[15:55:58] <clarkbox> you can see the quick downloads with this search:
[15:56:15] <clarkbox> sourcetype="access_combined" uri_path="/resources/download/jquery-ui-*.custom.zip"
[17:16:14] <rxaviers> clarkbox, how do change "Search schedule" of a graph?
[17:16:45] <rxaviers> actually, I dont wanna change the schedule. But, I wanna make a report search daily only.
[17:56:03] <rxaviers> clarkbox, another question. There's a dowload builder report called "common bundles". Its time range is "-30d". May I change it to the beginning "0" or is it too heavy?
[18:05:38] <rxaviers> clarkbox, question 3. We have "top components". Can we have a "top widgets", where the search is "top components" filtered by ~`if component in ["accordion"
[18:05:39] <rxaviers> , 
[18:05:39] <rxaviers> "autocomplete"
[18:05:39] <rxaviers> , 
[18:05:39] <rxaviers> "button"
[18:05:40] <rxaviers> , 
[18:05:42] <rxaviers> "datepicker"
[18:05:44] <rxaviers> , 
[18:05:48] <rxaviers> "dialog"
[18:05:50] <rxaviers> , 
[18:05:52] <rxaviers> "menu"
[18:05:54] <rxaviers> , 
[18:05:56] <rxaviers> "progressbar"
[18:05:58] <rxaviers> , 
[18:06:00] <rxaviers> "slider"
[18:06:02] <rxaviers> , 
[18:06:04] <rxaviers> "spinner"
[18:06:07] <rxaviers> , 
[18:06:08] <rxaviers> "tabs"
[18:06:10] <rxaviers> , 
[18:06:12] <rxaviers> "tooltip"
[18:06:14] <rxaviers> ]`
[18:29:39] <djQuery> do we have instructions for refreshing our dev environment after submitting a pull request 
[18:29:59] <djQuery> I am sure there have been other pull requests accepted since I did my last one
[18:31:20] <djQuery> $ git pull upstream master
[18:31:47] <djQuery> I get this back does that mean it was successfull? First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
[19:13:10] <djQuery> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5901
[19:13:42] <djQuery> would it be better to have a 2nd option rather than just reusing the dialog class
[19:14:07] <djQuery> or should the documentation just statthat you need to define your css as .ui-widget-overlay.critical-alert { background:red; }
[19:14:28] <djQuery> either or would be a quick fix
[19:31:06] <petersendidit> mikesherov: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/895, I am good with either option.
[19:31:06] <b-ot> petersendidit: Pull request #895 by petersendidit (2d 9h ago): Effects Core: make removeClass work correctly with changes jQuery 1.9.0....
[19:45:30] <clarkbox> rxaviers: 1) you can edit the schedule setting the saved search driving the dashboard panel. that assumes the panel does not use a "inline" search. let me know what panels you want to schedule, and ill set it up. you can learn by example
[19:46:45] <clarkbox> 2) you can change it to be all time, but it will impact performanceâ€¦ every time the page loads it has to conduct that search through a LOT of data. to mitigate this issue, we can setup the search to only happen once per day, and the dashboard will show cached results.
[19:48:38] <clarkbox> 3) sure it can be done. if you just copy the search from "top components" and then add to the search "NOT core NOT widget NOT mouse"â€¦ etc
