[00:00:21] <uGoMobi> ah I see
[00:00:34] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: His codes are containing her PR codes, in that case, Her PR can be added automatically?
[00:02:01] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Actually she is wondering about that case. She did a PR, and then her codes was included Gabirel's commit.
[00:02:12] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: don't think we should merge a PR that doesn't change anything (anymore)
[00:02:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ are you around?
[00:05:34] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: It can happen that we didn't see a PR yet before we fix something ourselves
[00:05:48] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: _|Nix|_ is working very hard on updating the API docs
[00:05:59] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: yes, I think so.
[00:06:28] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: So it's not like we are not happy with the PRs
[00:06:32] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: yes, I know that he is really hard to update that. :)
[00:06:41] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: It's just that we can't always review PRs right away
[00:07:18] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Ok, I can understand your word and jQM team's status.
[00:07:34] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: maybe good if _|Nix|_ and your team discuss how to avoid duplicate efforts
[00:08:42] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Ok~ Your comment seems better. Thanks for your kind reply. :)
[00:09:30] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: You're welcome and thanks again to you and your team for all your help!
[00:10:11] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: As you know _|Nix|_ and my team work in web-ui-fw and some dulications will be occurred.
[00:10:28] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: you're welcome~
[00:17:17] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, arschmitz: Came back~! (I left my desk for a while.)
[00:17:38] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, arschmitz, Changsuk: I saw Changsuk's questions and  your and arschmitz's answers just now.
[00:18:42] <Hyunsook> Changsuk: Thank you for questions instead me.
[00:18:48] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi, arschmitz: Thank you for explanation. :)
[00:19:16] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: You're welcome
[00:19:27] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: Thanks again for your PRs :)
[00:19:52] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: You're welcome. ;)
[00:20:42] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: I already know that Gabriel and you guys continually reviewing and upgrading the api of 1.4 branch now.
[00:20:58] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: So you guys may not need PRs yet,  I thought for a moment.
[00:23:23] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: If my PRs can help you guys, I'll submit PRs. :)
[00:24:15] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: Your PRs do help, it is just that we have to coordinate a bit to prevent people working on the same thing
[00:24:45] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: _|Nix|_ is doing most of the API docs updating work now, so I think it's best to discuss with him
[00:25:11] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Ahha~ I see.
[00:25:53] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: I'll discuss with _|Nix|_.
[00:26:09] <uGoMobi> Hyunsook: Great! Thank you!
[00:55:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm just looking in ...
[00:55:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: morning
[00:56:05] <_|Nix|_> Oh no ... did I once more make the same change as someone else?
[00:56:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I saw you were looking for me this weekend. I guess it was about that page option theme bug
[00:56:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: It happens, I am sure Hyunsook understands :)
[00:57:42] <_|Nix|_> Dang nab it ... 
[00:57:59] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, but I think getting commits in is important for them ... 
[00:58:17] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ...

[05:48:40] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper :-)
[05:48:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne
[05:49:08] <agcolom> I'm working on the icons page, as I am stuck at home! (no trains after the big storm!)
[05:49:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, I saw it on the news. It's the same here... everyone is asked to stay at home
[05:49:48] <agcolom> what is the best way to just show an icon next to some text? (not in a button or in any widget)
[05:50:17] <agcolom> It was during the night here, so I'm exhausted! It was just so noisy!
[05:50:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I'll make an example in a JS Bin for you
[05:50:28] <agcolom> thx :-)
[05:50:48] <agcolom> so far, I've added the category and the 1st page... 
[05:51:00] <agcolom> now working on the list of icons
[05:59:09] <agcolom> It's all gone quiet, so I'll go have a look at the park and see what it's like there... be back soon :-)
[06:01:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: something like this... http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/70/edit (see also CSS rule in the head)
[06:01:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, see you later
[06:26:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wow! I just read!
[06:26:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I hope my flight to AMS won't be cancelled ...

[06:28:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The 3rd.
[06:28:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, Sunday. Afternoon, IIRC.
[06:28:40] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:28:48] <uGoMobi> should be fine by then :)
[06:34:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: morning
[06:34:55] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[06:35:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: at some point id like to go over some change log stuff with you
[06:35:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[06:35:52] <arschmitz> just let me know when you have a minute
[06:42:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[07:13:48] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer kborchers Can someone take a real quick look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1121 I verified the fix works on JAWS / NVDA / VoiceOver, I just want a quick sanity check before I land it.
[07:13:48] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: Pull request #1121 by mpiotrowicz (11h 47m ago): Accordion: moving aria-expanded attribute from active tabpanel to active tab. Fixe...
[07:16:07] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: looking
[07:16:26] <kborchers> tj_vantoll: i haven't tested it but the code changes seem sane and if AT properly announces i think that's fine but would prefer if someone else actually tested too
[07:18:51] <jzaefferer> Looks sane to me, too. And tj_vantoll has tested it, so that should be good. Or do you want a third tester, kborchers?
[07:19:15] <kborchers> nah i think that's good
[07:19:54] <tj_vantoll> Ok cool, thanks guys.
[07:24:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, seems good. The only reason I didn't make the change myself already is because I wanted to discuss wether we should remove ARIA from accordion.
[07:24:08] <tj_vantoll> btw I met Monika at HTML5DevConf and she's interested in contributing to the a11y aspect of our widgets. I pointed her at the slew of a11y tickets that just came in.
[07:24:21] <tj_vantoll> Why?
[07:25:30] <scott_gonzalez> http://webaim.org/discussion/mail_message?id=23579
[07:26:08] <scott_gonzalez> These archives are a pain to go through, and this was a big thread.
[07:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> http://webaim.org/discussion/mail_message?id=23952
[07:27:59] <tj_vantoll> Thanks for the links, those threads are a pain to navigate.
[07:28:38] <tj_vantoll> So ditching the ARIA would just present the information as normal content.
[07:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not sure if Bryan recommends doing anything like custom key handling to move up to the header.

[08:22:47] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: except now a contained draggable can't scroll
[08:22:52] <mikesherov> so there is some weird behavior
[08:23:06] <mikesherov> I'm working on a new solution
[08:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> Can't scroll at all?
[08:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> So if the container isn't fully visible, you can't drag to the edge?
[08:23:58] <mikesherov> http://jsfiddle.net/VPqBp/30/
[08:24:10] <mikesherov> so if you pop in my latest patch as your loca
[08:24:23] <mikesherov> you'll see you can drag down and it'll scroll, but not back up again
[08:24:40] <mikesherov> still need to add a lot of coverage to this test suite
[08:24:51] <mikesherov> even when the API is rewritten and pruned
[08:29:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this is kinda busted.
[08:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to add a comment to the PR so this doesn't get lost.

[08:51:01] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I've noticed that the syntax highlighter used for processing <pre><code>...</code></pre> from the entries does not allow one to properly copy the indentation when one highlights the code snippet. However, on the syntaxhighlighter web site when I copy a snippet, the indentation does come through.
[08:51:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Are we using the latest version of syntaxhighlighter? (3.0.83)
[08:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: It's working fine for me.
[08:52:05] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Hmmm ... then maybe it's just my browser ...
[08:52:38] <scott_gonzalez> Which browser?
[08:52:47] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: FF.
[08:52:56] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: But FF works with the syntaxhighlighter Web site.
[08:53:16] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: FF24
[08:53:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, seems to be something with Firefox.
[08:53:40] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome is copying the indentation properly.
[08:55:09] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK, but then how come it's not happening on the syntaxhighlighter home page? http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/
[08:55:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: We /are/ using that syntax highlighter, right?

[08:55:58] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Oh, OK. Wow!
[08:56:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, I should be indenting with &nbsp;?
[08:56:17] <scott_gonzalez> no
[08:56:24] <scott_gonzalez> You should be indenting with tabs.

[11:28:33] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Hi Gabriel, just to let you know that I plan on adding the new icons to the http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/buttonMarkup/ page. Hope that's ok with you??
[11:38:00] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's already fixed. Hyunsook fixed example 17.
[11:38:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Sure.
[11:38:34] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes, I saw the example 17, thanks (I was not in sync at the time...)
[11:39:07] <agcolom> Ok, great, so I hope to add those other icons this evening... I'm catching up as my family is away on holiday!
[11:39:32] <agcolom> and I was stuck at home all day after the "storm"
[11:40:48] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: you may be able to see this: https://www.facebook.com/annegaelle.colom/posts/10153406458515553
[11:40:56] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, I read about that. Dang! Hurricane force!
[11:41:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom _|Nix|_ : In general we should prevent having the same content at multiple places in the docs (low maintenance)
[11:41:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Agreed.
[11:41:27] <uGoMobi> since multiple widgets use icons I think it's best to have one page about icons
[11:42:10] <uGoMobi> and refer to that page from buttonMarkup, input buttons, listview, collapsible, etc.
[11:42:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suggest we use /entries/classes.xml
[11:42:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It already has an entry for each icon.
[11:42:40] <agcolom> ok, so should we reduce the http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/resources/buttonMarkup/example10.html to only one, and then say see this page for full listing?
[11:42:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: wow that are a lot of broken trees o_O
[11:42:52] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I think so, yes.
[11:43:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: We should link to the classes page from each widget that has an icon option.
[11:43:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the thing with the classes page is that it's only applicable for button markup at the moment
[11:43:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No.
[11:43:39] <_|Nix|_> I added all kinds of classes since then.
[11:43:46] <uGoMobi> listviews, collapsibles, etc still use data-icon
[11:44:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wait - I see what you mean.
[11:44:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I need to move that table up to the top level.
[11:46:19] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: having an icon page is also about being consistent with UI
[11:47:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK. In that case I'll get rid of the whole icons section from the classes page.
[11:47:30] <agcolom> No I think it's good to have it there too
[11:47:55] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK, but then we have some duplication, no?
[11:48:02] <agcolom> because some people would look for icons and others for classes...
[11:48:20] <agcolom> They do not provide the same info... 
[11:48:38] <agcolom> I would say they are complementary
[11:48:41] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Well, in our case, the class is always ui-icon-<icon-name>
[11:49:10] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, if you list the icon names, you can mention that the class is constructed from the name by prepending "ui-icon-"
[11:49:22] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's how I did it in buttonMarkup.
[11:49:26] <agcolom> yes, but if classes is to list all classes, then icon should be there too
[11:49:49] <_|Nix|_> I guess that's true.
[11:50:01] <agcolom> however, the classes page does not show how the icons look exactly
[11:50:12] <agcolom> so that is on the icons page
[11:50:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: No, but that's only because I didn't add it.
[11:50:18] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK.
[11:50:54] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Then you can add a link to the icon page from the classes page, after you've added the icon page, right?
[11:51:01] <agcolom> yes
[11:51:09] <_|Nix|_> OK. Sounds good!
[11:51:13] <agcolom> good :-)
[11:51:40] <_|Nix|_> I'll add a blurb to the icons section explaining how the icon name used by options translates to the class name.
[11:51:55] <agcolom> ok, great! Thanks :-)
[11:51:58] <_|Nix|_> ... and I think I'll move the icon class list out of the button-specific section.
[11:52:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I did the same here http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/icons/#Iconset
[11:52:58] <agcolom> if that's not just for the buttons, then yes that would make sense
[11:53:54] <agcolom> just watching the news... Looks like there were some trees down in Amsterdam also! So glad our meeting is next week! 
[11:54:11] <agcolom> (and not today!)
[11:54:15] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:54:38] <uGoMobi> storm is gone, but it left a bit of chaos behind
[11:55:27] <agcolom> same here... I hope the trains run tomorrow (I am marking student presentations from 9am to about 5 or 6pm!)
[11:56:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ping
[11:57:15] <_|Nix|_> We had a similar storm in december of 2011.
[11:57:24] <_|Nix|_> Widespread chaos.
[11:57:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Pong!
[11:57:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am available to look at changelog
[11:58:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/proxy/browse.php?u=http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/classes/#icon-classes
[11:58:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok first this is how ui breaks theirs down
[11:58:41] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: You too :0 ^
[11:58:43] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:59:12] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Nice!
[11:59:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: can you not use the actual icon with description?
[11:59:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... I think I could with a bunch of small iframes, but that might be too heavy.
[12:00:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: couldnt you just place the png's in the resources directory?
[12:00:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess, but then we'd have to keep them in sync.
[12:01:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you could alos link to the ones on the cdn
[12:01:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are they reachable from the CDN or someplace?
[12:01:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right :)
[12:01:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so I can, eh? OK, then I will.
[12:01:44] <arschmitz> just seemed like for icons it makes sense 
[12:01:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But wait, the whole thing is an XML ... I can't exactly put arbitrary HTML in there ...
[12:02:04] <uGoMobi> but that would be a version specific link
[12:02:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's fine - we have plenty of that in resources.
[12:02:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I actually added a script to update these references in bulk.
[12:02:39] <uGoMobi> ah ok, cool
[12:02:40] <arschmitz> yeah it well just be a step in the api deploy process to update
[12:03:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there must be a way to put an image in the xml

[12:03:46] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 061-4: 02http://git.io/rGsG6Q
[12:03:47] <uGoMobi> why not one iframe with all 50 icons
[12:03:47] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/061-4 14e11c14e 15Gabriel Schulhof: Classes: Promote icon classes to the top level class listing.
[12:03:53] <uGoMobi> ?
[12:04:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I suppose I could move the entry from entries/classes.xml to pages/classes.html ...
[12:04:17] <uGoMobi> could even use something like this http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/icons-grunticon/
[12:04:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^
[12:04:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: was just going to suggest that http://api.jqueryui.com/theming/icons/
[12:04:26] <_|Nix|_> Then I could use the icons easily.
[12:04:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i would do it just like ui does 
[12:05:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, they use a HTML page.
[12:05:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[12:05:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, we're talking about the classes listing, not necessarily icon-specific stuff.
[12:05:54] <arschmitz> i always forget how many icons ui has
[12:06:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well that page lists class then shows the icon
[12:06:15] <arschmitz> or other way around rather
[12:06:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think agcolom will do the icon-specific portion, in which case she can drop a link into the classes.xml to take people to the icons page.
[12:06:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but our classes.xml lists class not only for icons, but theme, and widget-specific stuff.
[12:06:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... as well.
[12:07:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://api.jqueryui.com/theming/css-framework/
[12:08:06] <arschmitz> ui separatea them completely
[12:08:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that classes page is maybe more something for the reference
[12:08:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I think that's pretty much our classes.xml ...
[12:08:34] <arschmitz> should we just have a themeing menu item like ui
[12:08:43] <arschmitz> and other it will be icons and classes
[12:08:54] <arschmitz> and classes just liek ui will not list individual icon classes
[12:08:59] <arschmitz> and leave that to the icons page
[12:09:07] <arschmitz> then there is no duplication
[12:09:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: agcolom: ^^^
[12:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> Generally if you're writing content in the XML, you're actually writing HTML.
[12:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm not sure where the disconnect is.
[12:10:22] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, if I can drop arbitrary HTML in there, then that's fine.
[12:10:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Then we can move the actual list to the icons section, and keep the blurb about how to construct the icon class from the icon name.
[12:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> A list of classes should be a page though.
[12:11:03] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure why you would've made it an entry.
[12:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> What entry type were you using?
[12:11:43] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I didn't give it a type, so whatever's default.
[12:12:00] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh
[12:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to make that break so you don't ever do that again.
[12:12:20] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:13:13] <_|Nix|_> /o Yessir!
[12:20:04] <scott_gonzalez> Why do the mobile entries have a stylesheet specified?
[12:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/e11c14e4ae41ee15f0737c154cc78e886e093dcd/entries/classes.xml#L2
[12:27:53] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's for the examples at the bottom.
[12:28:24] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[12:28:49] <scott_gonzalez> Are you loading these directly into your browser?
[12:28:52] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK, so that page doesn't have any, but the widgets in general do.
[12:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't explain why the stylesheet is hard-coded in the XML.
[12:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> Also, this isn't valid: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/e11c14e4ae41ee15f0737c154cc78e886e093dcd/entries/classes.xml#L8-L9
[12:30:30] <scott_gonzalez> A paragraph can't contain a table.
[12:32:08] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: _|Nix|_ should classes be a page just like https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/e11c14e4ae41ee15f0737c154cc78e886e093dcd/pages/data-attribute.html ?
[12:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Yes. I believe _|Nix|_ already said he was going to change it.
[12:32:57] <agcolom> oh, sorry, I missed that (on the phone with my mum!)

[13:19:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom _|Nix|_ : what is the plan with icons in the API docs?
[13:19:27] <uGoMobi> agcolom _|Nix|_ : are we going to create icons page in theming category like UI does? http://api.jqueryui.com/category/theming/
[13:20:27] <agcolom> uGoMobi: up to you. For now, I've added it in its own category, as per your doc
[13:21:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ah ok, I was just changing the doc because I thought the plan was changed
[13:21:32] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but I am fine with own category :)
[13:22:04] <uGoMobi> agcolom: what do you think is best?
[13:22:26] <agcolom> They stand out nicely in their own category
[13:22:35] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:23:06] <agcolom> We can change it (it's a one line change) if we decide to move it to theming later...
[13:23:14] <uGoMobi> just to be clear, that doc is just meant to have some sort of guideline but it's not like it have to be like that
[13:23:21] <uGoMobi> feel free to make changes
[13:23:28] <agcolom> oh, ok :-)
[13:24:09] <uGoMobi> s/have/has/
[13:24:12] <agcolom> but I think icons are quite a big deal in jQuery Mobile, so I think it's nice to have them separate for now... and as you suggested would be good to add the svg info, etc...
[13:24:25] <uGoMobi> right
[13:25:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: one thing that is wrong in that doc, is that the categories are not in alphabetical order
[14:15:40] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I think they are in alphabetical order
[14:16:25] <agcolom> (I'm seeing them in alphabetical order)
[14:17:13] <uGoMobi> oh really?
[14:17:32] <agcolom> yes
[14:17:32] <uGoMobi> pages - theming - icons - methods - etc

[14:17:55] <agcolom>     Methods
