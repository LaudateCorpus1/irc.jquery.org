[07:02:38] <gnarf> hrm. scott_gonzalez - maybe we could set the "modifed" time in the metadata?
[07:02:56] <rworth> gnarf let's catch up folks in here
[07:03:25] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/debd5b8082eab2e73dba
[07:03:30] <gnarf> ^^^
[07:03:50] <rworth> nacin thoughts?
[07:04:21] <gnarf> I don't wanna always see "last edited: 2 minutes ago" on every post either :)
[07:04:24] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Modified time should automatically be set by WP.
[07:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[07:04:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but don't you "edit" the post each time the deploy runs?
[07:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:04:56] <gnarf> or is WP smart enough to detect the "non-edit"
[07:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> No, we could try to make it smart.
[07:05:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i was thinking if we could set the modified via meta-data
[07:05:35] <rworth> but we'd still want to be able to make a minor change without the smart being too smart
[07:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: What do you mean?
[07:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> any change = edit
[07:06:20] <rworth> You should be able to correct a typo without triggering an rss update
[07:06:26] <rworth> but if you add a new paragraph...
[07:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> How do you do that via the UI?
[07:07:17] <gnarf> you could generate it based on the git log -1 file | grep "Date:"
[07:07:35] <gnarf> so the "modified" is the last commit that touched the file
[07:08:00] <rworth> that would be better than having always the publish date, but still catches minor changes
[07:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We don't have source maps.
[07:08:23] <rworth> scott_gonzalez not sure. I have a feeling WordPress may have some smarts somewhere, but I can't recall/find anything
[07:08:34] <rworth> not seeing anything in the default ui
[07:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> Do we really send RSS entries for updates?
[07:09:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the RSS Entries that exist have a modified time
[07:09:25] <rworth> which is what will trip up readers
[07:09:26] <gnarf> which causes most readers to be "alarmed" for every modification
[07:09:49] <gnarf> for instance, if the modified time constantly changes, it will forever be unread in apple mail
[07:10:04] <rworth> scott_gonzalez mmmm, source maps
[07:10:11] <gnarf> also, check out my awesome haiku:
[07:10:14] <gnarf> .tweet gnarf37
[07:10:15] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from gnarf37: My sign I need to sleep: I'm writing Comment Haiku: https://t.co/NWDGZKvV ★ http://bit.ly/Ig8sW4
[07:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> I've got an idea, but we'll have to wait for nacin to find out if it will work.
[07:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> We probably only care about content changes as updates.
[07:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> So we can store a checksum of the content in the metadata.
[07:13:33] <scott_gonzalez> And compare that to see if it changed.
[07:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> We'd probably want to still push other changes though, like taxonomies, custom fields, etc. if there are any changes.
[07:14:27] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if we can make that distinction, or if WP already does that anyway.
[07:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> WP might even already be smart enough to know that nothing actually changed when we call wp.editPost()
[07:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> IT COULD BE THE CASE THAT THESE GUYS ARE FUCKING GENIUSES AND TEN STEPS AHEAD OF US!!!11
[07:15:22] <rworth> it's happened before
[08:22:58] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: whenever you save, it updates the modified time. mainly because there are so many things that could be modified on save (options, meta, taxonomies) that running a "diff" really doesn't make sense.
[08:23:26] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: checksum seems fine, since you can't easily git log.
[08:26:53] <rworth> nacin can you take a quick look at https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/26 and https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/27 ?
[08:26:54] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no issue found
[08:26:57] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: and like previously, we can add a new method to return the checksum of all content (probably just as part of the existing method we created)
[08:32:02] <nacin> rworth: fixed 26. dropped a note on 27.
[08:32:59] <rworth> perfect, thanks
[08:33:10] <gnarf> i figured it might be as easy as https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/1338c2aa52f60082decf4fdaec36a58a9ed34508 :)
[08:33:11] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on web-base-template by nacin (2m, 53s ago): Add jQuery Filters plugin. Turn off smileys.
[08:33:54] <rworth> at some point today, I'd like to create and test a (non-puppet) process for someone to get a local multi-site that is similar to our staging setup
[08:34:15] <gnarf> rworth: thats a noble idea :)
[08:34:18] <rworth> nacin what all is on the server that's not in web-base-template. Just wp-config.php ?
[08:34:35] <nacin> and the nginx setup.
[08:34:49] <rworth> but local could just be MAMP without nginx
[08:34:54] <nacin> setting up a local multisite that is similar to the existing staging setup is not particularly easy.
[08:34:58] <gnarf> and the database obviously
[08:35:15] <nacin> if you switch out nginx for MAMP, I would also switch out multisite for single.
[08:35:22] <rworth> hmm
[08:35:32] <gnarf> rworth: btw - https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/21 -- seems this vagrant thing might be cool for the local VMs :)
[08:35:33] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no issue found
[08:36:04] <nacin> obviously, we'll have a way to set it up, but there should be no problems testing a single site.
[08:36:21] <rworth> nacin except all the sites are/will be interconnected
[08:36:28] <rworth> we'll soon be on to books and profiles
[08:36:35] <rworth> and companies
[08:36:36] <nacin> got it
[08:36:42] <rworth> each listed in the footers on some sites
[08:36:55] <nacin> for testing reasons it would probably be best to still architect it in a way that they work in single-site
[08:37:02] <nacin> but that is easy
[08:37:03] <rworth> single site is easy enough today - just grab themes from web-base-template
[08:37:27] <gnarf> rworth: we could setup a "staging server" vagrant .box file
[08:37:39] <rworth> how would that work? Didn't we talk about switching to a site to get info from another site?
[08:37:48] <rworth> might've been a discussion with koop
[08:38:16] <nacin> I was around. it's just a matter of graceful degradation to allow you to test a single site without going through the trouble of setting up the whole thing
[08:38:25] <nacin> could be helpful for api, plugins, etc.
[08:38:30] <rworth> sure
[08:38:42] <gnarf> I'm kinda of the opinion that thats why we have the stage tho
[08:38:47] <rworth> I have no objection to all sites being architected to work in single+local
[08:39:04] <gnarf> but i guess local (offline) development is still important
[08:39:06] <rworth> gnarf we have only one stage envirnoment though
[08:39:12] <rworth> indeed
[08:39:28] <rworth> hey koopersmith
[08:39:38] <koopersmith> rworth: hey
[08:40:04] <rworth> so, we can even do nginx locally if it is that much simpler
[08:40:11] <nacin> it wouldn't be
[08:40:24] <rworth> sorry, you made it sound like it earlier
[08:41:22] <gnarf> i think the "difficult" part is lining up all the MU site db installs
[08:41:32] <gnarf> with the wp-config id #'s
[08:42:06] <gnarf> the nginx config is minimal
[08:49:09] <rworth> nacin so can we automate the multi-site database setup and sync with wp-config ?
[08:49:47] <nacin> that'd be the idea
[08:49:59] <nacin> not something I have time for today unfortunately
[08:50:22] <rworth> that's fine. I can go through the manual steps (and document) for the time being
[08:50:27] <rworth> thanks
[08:50:52] <gnarf> nacin: also - are the wp-config / nginx wordpress.conf  mostly stable now ( should I get them into puppet? )
[08:51:06] <nacin> gnarf: if you can get them into puppet that would be great. they are both stable.
[08:51:10] <gnarf> k
[08:51:13] <nacin> been meaning to all week but haven't had the chance
[08:51:21] <gnarf> I'll handle it
[08:51:30] <rworth> that will certainly simplify my steps
[09:35:11] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Yeah, I was thinking we would return the checksum as part of the post path API.
[09:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> That's not high priority right now. We'll let the other stuff get dealt with first.
[09:35:34] <scott_gonzalez> This won't be an issue until we're working on blogs.
[09:59:42] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: The sanitization on post names is killing the postPath :-(
[10:00:34] <scott_gonzalez>  post/addClass -> post/addclass, so our local path doesn't match the WP path.
[10:01:02] <scott_gonzalez> .toLowerCase() is easy enough, but I know there's a lot more sanitization that goes on.
[10:02:00] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: there is a plugin in web-base-template to prevent that
[10:02:23] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: web-base-template/mu-plugins/jquery-slugs.php
[10:02:39] <nacin> preserves dots, preserves capitalization.
[10:02:41] * scott_gonzalez add that to my local install
[10:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> I should probably stop testing against a bare WP install.
[10:04:08] <scott_gonzalez> That doens't explain the problem on staging though...
[10:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'll keep digging.
[10:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Are you sure jquery-slugs is for name, not title?
[10:17:27] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yes
[10:17:41] <nacin> let me test
[10:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't seem to change anything. I still get lowercase names.
[10:18:32] <nacin> confirmed. will take a look.
[10:18:38] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[10:24:26] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: pushed
[10:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> Looks better.
[10:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> Truncating and verifying again.
[10:28:06] <nacin> I cleaned up karl's plugin during the dev day without confirming that it, well, worked
[10:28:30] <kswedberg> ohai nacin! :)
[10:28:39] <nacin> :-)
[10:28:50] <nacin> be back after I get some lunch.
[10:28:53] <scott_gonzalez> works :-)
[10:29:02] <gnarf> _o/
[11:21:01] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: is there a timeline for 1.8.20?
[11:21:12] <nacin> #8262 bit us.
[11:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> How about Monday?
[11:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:25:33] <nacin> I won't complain. no need to rush it out for us, though.
[11:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.19 was kinda busted, I didn't want to wait a full month for 1.8.20.
[11:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> @VERSION replacement failure :-/
[11:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> Not bad for the only problem with a completely new build system, though.
[11:59:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: maybe we should make stage.jquery.org the next push?
[12:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and rworth  are already working on qunitjs.com and api.jquery.com
[12:02:20] <scott_gonzalez> They stole my whole morning :-P
[12:05:40] <gnarf> heh
[17:21:29] <clarkbox> does new version of https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack need to be deployed?
