[05:00:27] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: looks like that position problem is happening consistently across all builds, but only in IE8
[05:04:05] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: this is the first job that started failing with the position problem: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/668/ - interestingly enough, the only thing that changed was something in the TestSwarm UI: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/6e55168318495da50cae457433eae2438699e1f3

[05:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Perhaps its the new BrowserStack VMs
[05:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have a local IE 8 for testing?
[05:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't set up any of my VMs on my new laptop yet.
[05:45:15] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: those look an awful lot like our mysterious IE8 margin error from a couple of months ago:

[05:46:01] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: reverted that fix, as it didn't help; starting my win7/ie8 virtual box
[05:55:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Is there a testing meeting today?
[05:56:14] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: no, that's next week. its devlead/testing/devlead/testing...
[05:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I thought we had switched to every week for testing. I'll update my calendar.
[05:57:57] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, I missed the weekly updates the past two weeks.
[05:58:18] <scott_gonzalez> All this traveling is screwing up my routine.
[05:58:40] <scott_gonzalez> I guess this week's update should include the past three weeks...
[06:03:11] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: just put the jQuery calendar into your calendar?
[06:03:39] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin: I just ran the position testsuite in a Win7/IE8 VM, works fine
[06:03:58] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: did you run it through testswarm's wrapper?
[06:04:03] <DaveMethvin> that's what was causing it before
[06:04:20] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: no, that's even more painful to set up
[06:04:23] <DaveMethvin> haha
[06:04:49] <DaveMethvin> you remember that bug? somehow mikesherov tracked it down to that font size
[06:04:54] <jzaefferer> What's "Windows NT 6.0"? XP?
[06:04:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:05:17] <DaveMethvin> i think they actually use Windows server 2003, which is very close to xp

[06:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> "exactly similar" :-P
[06:06:28] <jzaefferer> there's no difference in the UA: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/290709 vs http://swarm.jquery.org/result/272935
[06:07:06] <DaveMethvin> genuine imitation windows
[06:07:30] <DaveMethvin> so did the position test change any on the UI side recently?
[06:07:49] <DaveMethvin> looks like the testswarm css hasn't changed since you fixed it a couple of months ago for us jzaefferer
[06:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, nothing changed.
[06:08:06] <DaveMethvin> grrrrr
[06:10:36] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: Are you working on the grunt task to generate the "quick download"?
[06:10:42] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I am
[06:10:44] <rxaviers> almost there
[06:10:49] <jzaefferer> okay, great
[06:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> We haven't really been touching code: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/master/
[06:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer pointed out that this is the commit that started failing: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/6e55168318495da50cae457433eae2438699e1f3
[06:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> Clearly not the cause of the failure.
[06:14:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah i can't recall what started our  IE8 position problem either, and the failure conditions were so specific ... we could never repro outside testswarm
[06:14:36] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov was just doggedly persistent in figuring it out

[06:17:15] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, grunt build task ^... Althgouh, Im stuck at this: sometimes the generated zip file works, sometimes not.
[06:18:34] <rxaviers> When the zip does not open, the file size looks like correct. But, does not unzip. I've never saw this building via server. Checking what might be happening
[06:27:04] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what's with the first function you pass to async.series?
[06:27:31] <jzaefferer> that doesn't actually seem to do anything
[06:27:35] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, just checks whether or not the file already exists and halts executing in case it does
[06:27:43] <rxaviers> execution*
[06:28:08] <jzaefferer> okay
[06:28:15] <jzaefferer> doesn't have to be in there really
[06:28:35] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, yeap ok.. it's sync anyway
[06:28:38] <jzaefferer> just inline that, and call done if it needs to fail
[06:28:38] <rxaviers> will merge both
[06:28:46] <jzaefferer> might help find the actual error
[06:29:35] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you can go back in history and look for that test.js file, that was writing the zip file to disk
[06:29:44] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I did that ;)
[06:29:46] <jzaefferer> maybe something in there helps figuring out how to do that right
[06:29:48] <jzaefferer> ah :-)
[06:30:26] <rxaviers> will simplify this whole series thing first
[06:32:23] <rxaviers> argh! still ssame error
[06:32:35] <rxaviers> it seems I need to delay done() after stream.end()
[06:32:36] <rxaviers> let me check
[06:33:32] <rxaviers> aha!
[06:34:12] <rxaviers> We might have an issue on done() closing streams before proper time
[06:34:37] <rxaviers> delaying done() in 500ms, I had no problem in 10 trials
[06:34:52] <rxaviers> otherwise, in 2 trials was always finding buggy package
[06:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Should you be listening for close instead of end?

[07:02:14] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, mm sure
[07:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> Also, can we put the generated build somewhere that won't cause a dirty tree?
[07:05:24] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, dist, build?
[07:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> dist or release would be fine.
[07:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if the release dir is sensitive to other data.
[07:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> Adding a dist directory is fine though.
[07:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> Probably makes sense to keep them separate.
[07:06:28] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: use manifest module to get a list of all components?
[07:06:52] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, what do you think of passing an ":all:" tag to Builder, and builder figures it out using manifest as pointed by jzaefferer ^
[07:06:57] <jzaefferer> to replace the allComponents list
[07:07:24] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, release may be cleaner then, since we already have that folder and since we'll have a .zip per folder anyway
[07:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> :all: is fine with me.
[07:09:33] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, if you are ok with the following priority, I would first (a) fix layout, because IE currently can't open DLB or TR well, (b) improve grunt build task as above
[07:09:46] <rxaviers> does it make sense?
[07:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather switch them, since (a) holds up site deployment and (b) holds up tagging
[07:11:32] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ok then
[07:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[07:12:19] <rxaviers> sure ywc
[07:15:32] <jzaefferer> :all: sounds odd
[07:15:45] <rxaviers> only "all"?
[07:15:55] <jzaefferer> can't you just call new Builder( manifest.all(), theme )?
[07:16:01] <jzaefferer> or whatever the right call would be?
[07:17:01] <rxaviers> currently, manifest functions are inside lib/release. It would be release.allComponents()
[07:17:11] <rxaviers> something like that
[07:17:16] <rxaviers> if you prefere, np
[07:17:29] <jzaefferer> yeah, what the call is
[07:17:34] <jzaefferer> just make it explicit
[07:17:47] <jzaefferer> builder is complicated enough already

[09:36:59] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/1-8] Upgrade to 1.8.24. - Scott González
[10:05:29] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer: why is this news? https://twitter.com/browserstack/status/253873347358765056
[10:05:40] <DaveMethvin> makes me wonder if they broke something
[10:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, because they got rid of it during the OS upgrade.
[10:06:10] <scott_gonzalez> They were only running IE8 on Win7.
[10:06:18] <DaveMethvin> oh, ok
[10:07:08] <DaveMethvin> does this coincide with the reappearance of this offset issue?
[10:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> The OS update was actually my first thought for why IE8 started failing.
[10:07:23] <scott_gonzalez> But they did that update a few days before the first failure.
[10:07:34] <DaveMethvin> ok
[10:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, wait.
[10:08:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to remember if the OS upgrade came before or after my presentation.
[10:09:11] <DaveMethvin> upstream,  jzaefferer says: there's no difference in the UA: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/290709 vs http://swarm.jquery.org/result/272935
[10:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> right
[10:09:32] <DaveMethvin> just seems....odd
[10:09:36] <DaveMethvin> suspicious
[10:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> That was another reason I didn't think it was related.
[10:10:11] <scott_gonzalez> But it's possible that they built new images for their VMs and that caused the problem.
[10:10:56] <DaveMethvin> strangely enough, Windows NT 6.0 is Vista: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537503(v=vs.85).aspx
[10:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:12:05] <DaveMethvin> but in our case i think it's Windows Server 2008
[10:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gettign Windows NT 6.0 when I use Windows 7 on BrowserStack.
[10:13:27] <DaveMethvin> which is also probably Windows Server 2008
[10:13:52] <DaveMethvin> that's back to their FAQ thing where they install desktop pieces-parts
[10:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I get NT 5.2 when using XP (which is Windows Server 2003)
[10:14:57] <scott_gonzalez> Though the tests pass in both using IE 8.
[10:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> So it's another issue that only exists with the API :-/
[10:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do production sites deploy on all semver tags or just stable semver tags?
[10:16:39] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: for now its just a regexp check /^v?\d+\.\d+/
[10:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We'll need to make that more restrictive.
[10:17:11] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sure
[10:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> We need to be able to tag pre-releases for cross-site deps.
[10:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> And not have that trigger production deploys.
[10:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> For example, right now we're tagging download.jqueryui.com to get new changes into jqueryui.com.
[10:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> But as soon as we deploy we won't be able to do that.
[10:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> Until the script is more restrictive.
[10:18:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: what rules do you think we should enforce?
[10:18:23] <gnarf> and/or how do you suggest enforcing them
[10:18:38] <scott_gonzalez>  /^v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/
[10:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> We can also support build numbers if you want, but I don't think any cares about site versions not matching code versions.
[10:19:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that avoids the ability to do like a -123
[10:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> Like jquery.com having a different version than jquery.
[10:19:54] <gnarf> well it might make sense on api sites to have at least the version number be based on the version its documenting
[10:19:57] <scott_gonzalez>  /^v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-\d+)?$/
[10:20:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems sane
[10:21:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you can use "pre" for non-released versions
[10:21:10] <scott_gonzalez> right
[10:21:32] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I'm looking for. The ability to do something like 1.9.1pre1
[10:21:34] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I'm looking for. The ability to do something like 1.9.1-pre1
[10:21:36] <gnarf> I'll update that rule right now
[10:23:25] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[11:31:44] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, please, just let me know if you want DLB to be tagged to 1.0.4 with that updates?
[11:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'm updating the release script right now. Once I have everything working, I'll tag and publish.
[11:33:36] <rxaviers> ok
[11:34:32] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, about the rules above, current 1.9.0-rc.1 wouldn't pass that because the extra dot rc.1, right?
[11:35:00] <scott_gonzalez> No, it wouldn't pass because of the rc
[11:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> You can only have numbers for it to pass.
[11:36:31] <rxaviers> is it the intention to have alphanumeric in the last argument too?
[11:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> no
[11:37:09] <scott_gonzalez> We explicitly don't want anything with letters in it.
[11:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> Letters = pre-release.
[11:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> We would never deploy 1.9.0-rc.1 to production.
[11:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> We also won't have alpha/beta/rc cycles for sites.
[11:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> We'll just have pre.
[11:38:57] <rxaviers> right ok. Builder unit test is failing because the extra dot in the rc.1 and I was wondering if that is something I should fix in the unit test or if it's a tag we won't have anymore.
[11:39:31] <scott_gonzalez> Wait, are we talking about different things?
[11:39:36] <rxaviers> we are
[11:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm talking abou the conversation I had with gnarf.
[11:40:12] <rxaviers> I was just speculating the above because I thought it had something to do
[11:40:39] <scott_gonzalez> We will continue to have UI releases in the form x.y.z-state.number
[11:40:58] <rxaviers> ok, excellent. will fix unit test then
[11:41:00] <rxaviers> thks
[11:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> *sigh* shelljs has no error handling for cp().
[11:43:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thats the second time i've been "meh" about shelljs
[11:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> What was the other?
[11:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> shelljs sets my lap on fire :-P
[11:44:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the "sync" exec :)
[11:44:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, 100% cpu use on pretty much anything
[11:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'm starting to wonder if I should just change the release script to actually use async code.
[11:48:09] <scott_gonzalez> Damnit Eich, where's my `yield`?
[12:00:40] <Rwhitbeck> Trying to get the web-base-template installed and when I run the wordpress install on step 7 I get "Something went very wrong when trying to install api.jqueryui.com as site 9-17. Find nacin."
[12:00:59] <Rwhitbeck> scott_gonzalez said he was here.
[12:01:03] <nacin> Indeed.
[12:01:22] <Rwhitbeck> yay found him…hmmm error still exists :P
[12:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: He started with PHP 5.2, so I'm wondering if maybe he ended up in a broken state before switching to 5.3.
[12:02:09] <nacin> hm. this is my bad. the array in jquery_sites() needs to be in blog_id order.
[12:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> WAY TO GO! YOU BROKE IT!
[12:03:45] <scott_gonzalez> I thought there was only one array of sites to avoid this problem. I guess not.
[12:04:01] <nacin> yeah, but it loops through and installs them in order
[12:04:08] <nacin> in the order they appear in the array
[12:04:30] <nacin> we don't specify a blog ID when we create the site. we just assume what the autoincrement is.
[12:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see, you put the 1.8 site in the middle.
[12:04:44] <nacin> yeah, I did that for organization purposes
[12:04:49] <nacin> writing a quick sort at the bottom
[12:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> You should've just used the array index + 1 :-)
[12:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> And not added in the middle.
[12:05:40] <nacin> the array index is the domain name
[12:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> indeed it is.
[12:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> You and your logic.
[12:06:06] <nacin> so we could also pre-sort them, which is fun.
[12:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: You should join #jquery-developer-summit
[12:07:31] <nacin> done
[12:07:40] <nacin> kept seeing chatter on it, but forgot
[12:10:26] <nacin> Rwhitbeck: if you wipe your DB tables then git pull, you should be good
[12:10:29] <nacin> sorry for the trouble
[12:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, I'm about to run the release script while sitting in Panera. Let's see how long this takes...
[12:11:14] <Rwhitbeck> thanks nacin, I'd rather find these issues now then in a week in DC.
[12:11:51] <nacin> I'll be in DC (I live here, actually), so while I agree, we would have solved it quick
[12:13:00] <scott_gonzalez> Rwhitbeck: If something like this happens in DC, stand up on a chair and yell for nacin :-P
[12:13:57] <Rwhitbeck> can we set up spot lights and sirens that will go off if we need him?
[12:15:09] <scott_gonzalez> Every table needs a nacin button.
[12:18:20] <Rwhitbeck> nacin now getting this when I try to run the installer https://gist.github.com/3835788
[12:18:38] <nacin> d'oh
[12:19:20] <nacin> had some debug code in there
[12:19:30] <Rwhitbeck> pull again?
[12:20:09] <Rwhitbeck> that got me past that error.  thanks..
[12:20:33] <nacin> yep, sorry.
[12:20:58] <Rwhitbeck> LOL, "WordPress has been installed. Were you expecting more steps? Sorry to disappoint."
[12:21:40] <nacin> That's the actual installer, unmodified.
[12:22:59] <gnarf> nacin: do you have a symbol we can put on a giant spotlight?
[12:23:24] <nacin> koopersmith: any ideas?
[12:24:01] <nacin> big WP logo is probably sufficient. failing that, a #blamenacin hashtag
[12:24:24] <koopersmith> hahaha, definitely the latter.
[12:33:47] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I added category descriptions to the filtering
[12:34:19] <nacin> bbiab.
[12:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> damn, the release script requires the download builder to be published.
[12:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> What a pain to test.
[12:41:26] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna test this again locally, then test the release script again.
[12:44:35] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/1WqwVw
[12:44:35] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Tagging 1.0.4. - Scott González
[13:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Any idea what might cause this? https://gist.github.com/3836091
[13:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> `grunt build` is working fine from my normal checkout.
[13:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, probably because I'm not calling `grunt prepare`.
[13:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> I probably need to copy the data over to mimic a prepare.
[13:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...well, the copying already happens from the generate_themes task.
[13:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe it doens't do enough?
[13:17:47] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe because it doesn't have the API files.
[13:50:59] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/0L-vCA
[13:50:59] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Build: Generate quick download in release script. - Scott González
[13:51:01] <scott_gonzalez> That was painful.
[13:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> Test runs of the release script are no longer possible :-(
[13:51:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm ok with that for 1.9.0, but we need to fix that for 1.9.1.
[13:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[13:52:55] <scott_gonzalez> If I just copy the entire jquery-ui checkout into download builder, that would probably fix that.
[13:53:37] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, actually, maybe this isn't even a problem.
[13:53:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it depends how much copying the generate_themes task does.
[13:54:38] <kborchers> anyone else enjoying watching scott_gonzalez talk to himself as much as i am? :P
[13:54:49] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[13:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> IRC is my rubber duck.
[13:54:56] <kborchers> heh
[14:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is there a way to do `cp -r jquery-ui` but not node_modules?
[14:25:04] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: rsync -a jquery-ui --exclude node_modules ?
[14:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I suppose I can add rsync to the release script.
[14:37:01] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #682: STILL FAILING in 46 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/682/
[14:37:01] <doesallmagic> Scott González: Build: Generate quick download in release script.
[15:10:02] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Are we good to go with site deployments?
[15:10:15] <scott_gonzalez> We'll probably want to flip the switch tomorrow.
[15:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> We should try to find a time that you, me, nacin, jzaefferer, rxaviers are all online.
[15:14:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sounds good, i'll be around all day after noon central
[15:14:09] <gnarf> maybe before then too
[15:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[15:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to need to fix the permalinks bug on all sites.
[15:15:56] <nacin> I will dig into it
[15:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> These cyclic dependencies are killing me.
[15:45:59] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I noticed that the theme folder name field is really annoying to use.
[15:46:11] <scott_gonzalez> The same annoying behavior exists on the old site
[15:46:27] <scott_gonzalez> cmd+a doesn't work because it's rewriting the value on keyup, I guess.
[15:46:41] <scott_gonzalez> Also, try typing ? and look at what happens.
[15:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> Then if you try to delete it, it'll just generate junk as you delete.
[15:47:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you mentioned something about permissions the other day
[15:47:30] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, the script that handles download.jqueryui.com.
[15:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> It seemed like maybe it was running as rot.
[15:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> *root
[15:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> We kept having to go in and fix permissions.
[15:48:10] <gnarf> you're correct, it is
[15:48:15] <gnarf> who should own it?
[15:48:19] <gnarf> jqdeploy right?
[15:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> probably
[15:49:07] <gnarf> actually
[15:49:11] <gnarf> i think root owns that one
[15:49:12] <gnarf> and runs it
[15:49:22] <gnarf> can prolly change that to jqdeploy tho
[15:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> Please do.
[15:49:51] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember where we were having the permissions issue, but I'd rather not find out again :-P
[15:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps jzaefferer remembers.
[15:50:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so i was having npm issues with www-data because it doesn't have access to write to its own home directory
[15:51:01] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[15:51:05] <gnarf> thats why its not www-data
[16:05:55] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers jzaefferer: We have a blocker.
[16:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> CSS Scope doesn't work.
[16:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> My guess is that we're reading in the cached CSS files.
[16:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...actually.
[16:07:30] <scott_gonzalez> Why were we applying a scope to everything before?
[16:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> Scoping just the theme-specific rules seems sane.
[16:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker_: You around?
[16:09:03] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know why this is a bug? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8095
[16:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> Not what's causing it, but why it would matter.
[16:12:26] <gnarf> maybe there are some theme specific areas where the scope isn't being supplied
[16:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You said this is fixed in the rewirite, but I'm not seeing the problem in the old TR.
[16:18:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Nope, all the theme-specific settings are scoped.
[16:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like the scoping is only being applied to selectors that start with ".ui"
[16:19:13] <scott_gonzalez> Which applies to all theme-specific settings.
[16:20:58] * rxaviers is back, reading...
[16:33:59] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, u here?
[16:34:03] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[16:34:46] <rxaviers> excellent.
[16:34:55] <rxaviers> could you figure out the problem you were having above?
[16:35:01] <rxaviers> with prepare (it seems)?
[16:35:21] * rxaviers is gonna be online from now till 3 more hours today
[16:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea what's going on, but it only happens when I do really hacky stuff.
[16:36:16] <rxaviers> I saw that problem when I have weird directories inside ./release/jquery-ui-1.9.0-rc.1, let's say ./release/jquery-ui-1.9.0-rc.1/empty_dir
[16:36:33] <rxaviers> dont know why how, but once I got this: ./release/jquery-ui-1.9.0-rc.1/jquery-ui-1.9.0-rc.1
[16:36:52] <rxaviers> Is it solved now? Or keep happening?
[16:37:47] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I was able to dig a little deeper and found a problem that doesn't make any sense to me.
[16:38:04] <scott_gonzalez> grunt manifest in jquery-ui is dying (inside grunt prepare in download builder)
[16:38:06] <rxaviers> ok, which one would you like me to look now
[16:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> But again, this is only when I'm doing really hacky stuff.
[16:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> Let me scroll up and see :-P
[16:40:00] <rxaviers> Tomorrow my plan is to be online from: 7:30am-10am BRT, then from 1:30pm-18pm
[16:40:05] <rxaviers> BRT
[16:40:08] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe look at the theme folder name field?
[16:40:25] <rxaviers> ok, in linux I use ctrl+a to select all, I have no problem here
[16:40:31] <rxaviers> on mac, cmd+a is buggy?
[16:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[16:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> As soon as it selects all, it gets unselected.
[16:40:43] <rxaviers> mm ok will test it
[16:41:01] <scott_gonzalez> I assume it's trying to clean the value and then doing .val( cleanedValue )
[16:41:07] <scott_gonzalez> Try typing ?
[16:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> Does it encode it for you?
[16:41:42] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: More important: TR is all kinds of busted in IE.
[16:42:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting an error, but I can't seem to track it down.
[16:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> And the sidebar isn't showing up.
[16:43:20] <rxaviers> I know IE has several fixes to make, including the display: table stuff
[16:44:20] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Im now working on: (a) theme folder, (b) scope, (c) IE fix
[16:44:37] <rxaviers> about theme foler, when I type " " (space) it encodes to "-"
[16:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Do you think the scope ticket is actually a bug?
[16:45:00] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like the behavior is actually fine.
[16:45:12] <scott_gonzalez> The new TR doens't add scope to the widget-specific rules.
[16:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> Which seems fine to me.
[16:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> It seems more correct than the old TR behavior of trying to scope everything.
[16:45:59] <scott_gonzalez> Unless the goal is to use multiple versions of UI, but WHO WOULD DO THAT?
[16:46:15] <rxaviers> you're talking about the ticket that says there are some styles that scope is not being applied?
[16:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[16:48:12] <rxaviers> makes no sense to me neither.. I also assumed it would be usefull to have scope applied to theme css's only
[16:50:47] <rxaviers> but, I just saw my scope rewrite is buggy. Some inline styles are not being correctly scoped.
[16:51:20] <scott_gonzalez> inline styles?
[16:55:54] <rxaviers> inline selectors: a, b
[17:05:32] * rxaviers 's rebooting in mac
[17:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> This shit is wearing on me.
[17:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to need a bottle of rum at my summit table.
[17:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: make it happen.
[17:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> I need run&coke
[17:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> Crap, forgot the tm
[17:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> run&coke™
[17:09:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: common, summit logistics in #jquery-developer-summit
[17:09:42] <gnarf> we went over this once :)
[17:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> Well, just take this as proof that this release is wearing on me :-P
[17:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> I want to kill the TR bookmarklet.
[17:11:48] <scott_gonzalez> I need jzaefferer and rworth to confirm.
[17:18:23] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez: aha! Now I saw it.
[17:18:41] <rxaviers> On mac firefox, it does NOT happen. But, on Safari, it does
[17:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[17:19:01] <rxaviers> I assume it happens on chrome too
[17:19:45] <rxaviers> it does
[17:20:47] * rxaviers rebooting back to linux
[17:25:54] <gnarf> so um
[17:26:16] <gnarf> im gonna try changing the user to jqdeploy for download-ui
[17:30:53] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHAHAHAHA http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph
[17:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> Biggest drop in the past year, by far: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph?days=365
[17:34:29] <scott_gonzalez> We're almost at 50% bright green too: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/29
[17:43:10] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, that's exactly what js is doing .val( escaped value ).. In chrome, it's unusable, one can't even walk with the cursor
[17:43:22] <rxaviers> (on keyup)
[17:43:31] <rxaviers> what would you like me to do here?
[17:43:47] <rxaviers> mean, what would you like it to be
[17:44:03] <scott_gonzalez> How about this?
[17:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> On focus, store the value.
[17:44:09] <rxaviers> ideally we could cancel wrong keys?
[17:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, let's just go real simple.
[17:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> On key up, get the value, remove invalids or replace them with -.
[17:45:48] <scott_gonzalez> If that causes the value to change, then update the field, if it doesn't, don't do anything to the field.
[17:47:00] <rxaviers> ok
[17:48:05] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what about the fact that when input is updated with val(), the cursor go to the end of the text.
[17:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably fine. It'll only happen if the user enters something invalid.
[17:49:17] <rxaviers> right ok
[17:49:30] <rxaviers> better than now anyway
[17:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> You're correct that ideally we'd cancel invalid input.
[17:49:39] <scott_gonzalez> But that's a lot harder to get right.
[17:49:51] <scott_gonzalez> When we finish the mask plugin, we can use that :-)
[17:49:59] <rxaviers> :-)
[17:50:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: oh man! that ticket graph :D
[17:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> I think the TR in IE is the last thing.
[17:51:07] <rxaviers> crossing fingers hehe
[17:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: If you have trouble tracking that down, I'll look into it in the morning.
[17:51:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not going to be very useful for the rest of the night.
[17:51:32] <rxaviers> I will let you know where I get before going to bed
[17:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm about ready to head home and not think.
[17:51:44] <rxaviers> eheh ok
[17:51:47] <rxaviers> gn night
[17:51:49] <rxaviers> gd*
[17:53:21] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I know :-) We'll get another one of those right after 1.9.1 too.
[17:54:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, heading home
[17:54:35] <kborchers> later scott_gonzalez
[17:54:46] <scott_gonzalez> Let's hope for the release actually happening tomorrow.
[18:10:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: whats the correct way to include logger now?
[18:10:54] <gnarf> nvm
[18:10:57] <gnarf> i can read docs
[19:56:53] <_zoggy_> firefox metro for win8 - https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/
[19:57:17] <relipse> how do I make my dialog look small and compact rather than big and toyish?
[19:58:25] <_zoggy_> not the place to be asking that kind of question. maybe go use google?
[19:59:39] <_zoggy_> jzaefferer -- Over the next month, Firefox users running Mac OS X 10.5 will see prompts letting them know that they’ll no longer receive updates. Barring any major stability or security issues found over the next few weeks, Firefox 16.0 will be our last release to support 10.5.

[20:43:19] <_zoggy_>     name = re.sub(r'[:"<>|?]', '', name)
[20:43:28] <_zoggy_>     name = name.strip(' .')
[20:44:05] <_zoggy_> so if you cant read that, we replace \/* with -
[20:44:25] <_zoggy_> then we strip out [:"<>|?]
[20:44:30] <_zoggy_> then strip leading and trailing .
[20:45:17] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] rxaviers pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/LCZzCw
[20:45:17] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Fix scope for inline selectors - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[20:45:17] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Add error message when adding file with no data to zip package - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[21:17:45] <rxaviers> _zoggy_, thks for the tip. I need to check with scott_gonzalez or jzaefferer what's the requirement for the filename. I dont know if we would follow the most restrictive filesystem rules or not. It's tough, because if you take ext3 for example, the only restriction is \0
[21:18:56] <rxaviers> need to check though how our build lib handles those generating the zip.. checking.
[21:19:38] <_zoggy_> right, but this is used by multiple os
[21:19:55] <_zoggy_> so you have to assume that any and all restrictions must apply
[21:20:49] <_zoggy_> or implment some os detection.. but who knows if the os use to generate the build will be the os that the zip is extracted upon.. thus have to make it work for all os
[21:22:04] <_zoggy_> but again, this is only if you care to dummy proof it
[21:22:23] <_zoggy_> people will prob easily learn their mistakes upon trying to extract/use it
[21:22:39] <rxaviers> well, the zip seems to pack those weird characters just fine (just tested <>=#!). Perhaps the user extractor needs to take care of those depending of the filesystem
[21:23:04] <rxaviers> but, it is good observation
[21:23:06] <_zoggy_> any plans to show the build size on the builder screen? report back how big each section/total is
[21:23:18] <_zoggy_> qtip2 does this (they use the old jui build script)
[21:23:47] <rxaviers> good question, right now we did not rewrite this functionality
[21:24:17] <rxaviers> biggest blocker now is that TR isnt working on IE
[21:24:36] <_zoggy_> hes converting his download builder to use grunt now.. so cant show a working example
[21:24:51] <_zoggy_> TR still looks funny in chrome, the labels/inputs
[21:27:53] <_zoggy_> http://zoggy.net/jui-tr2.png
[21:28:05] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, just fixed scope and folder name as we talked. But, I did not begin with IE fix. Heading bed now brb in coulpe hours
[21:29:20] <bubu> howdy
[21:29:23] <rxaviers> _zoggy_, do you see the same think in the previous site?

[21:30:00] <_zoggy_> rxaviers, nope
[21:30:16] <bubu> problem is, in each tab i have a document.ready() function, and it's getting called everytime the tab is clicked
