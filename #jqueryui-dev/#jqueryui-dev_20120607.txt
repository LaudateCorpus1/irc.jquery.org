[07:18:46] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is there a better way to do this?
[07:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> $page = get_post_type_object( 'page' );
[07:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> 	$page->exclude_from_search = true;
[07:20:41] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/2889055 [untested]
[07:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> I was actually trying to only search against a custom post type, but I see that it would use the same code.
[07:22:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'll test that now.
[07:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Seems to work. Thanks.
[07:23:17] <nacin> you can also do an array( 'post', 'plugin' ) there
[07:23:47] <nacin> putting final touches on install script
[08:40:27] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is there a relative date plugin that you'd recommend?
[08:41:12] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: core actually has a function called human_time_diff()
[08:42:01] <nacin> it isn't amazing (only gets as old as "days") but you could create a jquery_time_diff() if you wanted. Likewise, you could filter on get_the_date() or the_time() and make all dates relative in a theme.
[08:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Thanks.
[08:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just doing it on the search page.
[08:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> Days is probably fine for now.
[08:44:39] <scott_gonzalez> Looks really ghetto, but the functionality is getting there :-) http://cl.ly/393r2k10262S0p2v0D0x
[08:45:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's only searching against parent jquery_plugin posts and pulling in meta data.
[08:45:25] <scott_gonzalez> I got the custom post type working :-)
[08:46:04] <scott_gonzalez> We still need to figure out the URL schemes that we're going to use.
[08:46:25] <scott_gonzalez> How can I get search to also look at terms?
[09:18:00] <kswedberg1> nacin: any idea why I might be getting "Fatal error: Call to undefined function switch_to_blog() " when using search on my local copy of the api site (using web-base-template)?
[09:18:38] <kswedberg1> it seems to be working on stage.api.jquery.com
[09:19:44] <nacin> kswedberg1: wait for scott_gonzalez to do a git push and that switch_to_blog() should be gone. switch_to_blog() is not defined outside of multisite, but in this case, it is not needed.
[09:20:01] <kswedberg1> ah. ok.
[09:20:02] <kswedberg1> thx
[09:20:55] <scott_gonzalez> Just pushed.
[09:21:02] <kswedberg1> thx scott_gonzalez!
[09:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> Though I only edited plugins.jquery.com.
[09:21:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'll update all the themes right now.

[09:22:02] <kswedberg1> who here has the greatest xsl-fu? I'm at a loss
[09:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> done
[09:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> It only existed in plugins.jquery.com and the main theme.
[09:23:28] <kswedberg1> right on.
[09:23:29] <scott_gonzalez> So api.jquery.com is porbably just inheriting from the parent for the search page.
[09:24:12] <kswedberg1> yeah.
[09:24:30] <kswedberg1> gotta run. bbl
[09:24:33] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg1: I don't know XSL at all.
[09:24:41] <kswedberg1> k
[09:24:50] <kswedberg1> gotta get rworth on the case?
[09:24:52] <scott_gonzalez> But rworth or jzaefferer can probably fix that for you.
[09:38:44] <gnarf> kswedberg1: using a <![CDATA[ help?
[09:41:07] <rworth> kswedberg1 I'm around for a bit now
[10:38:31] <jzaefferer> kswedberg1: sup?

[10:52:10] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, It's just you. - http://github.com is up.
[10:52:22] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...back now
[11:04:33] <jzaefferer> kborchers: widget docs are mostly taken care of - if you've got time, looking at that menubar issue would be good. Should be an simple fix
[11:05:23] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, sorry i didn't get to the docs. crazy deadlines at work for JBoss World / Red Hat Summit have had me working at night too :/
[11:05:37] <jzaefferer> okay, no problem
[11:07:22] <kswedberg> rworth: sorry. was afk. jzaefferer was right … I need help with https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/35
[11:07:23] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #35 on api.jquery.com (kswedberg; 1h, 45m ago): entries2html.xsl: excerpt needs to be escaped for json output
[11:09:40] <jzaefferer> trying to integrate xml2json into the other xsl file seems like a rather bad idea
[11:09:47] <jzaefferer> can we do that processing in a grunt task?
[11:10:38] <jzaefferer> or is there another way to get custom fields into wordpress, without munching it through json? scott_gonzalez? after all, the point of using xml is a lot about not having to deal with escaping content...
[11:11:43] <rworth> kswedberg do you have time for a call?
[11:11:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We definitely can't send XML to WordPress :-P
[11:12:12] <jzaefferer> right, but the excerpt is html...
[11:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand what the problem is.
[11:12:58] <kswedberg> rworth: sure.
[11:13:09] <jzaefferer> we've got html content that currently needs to be escaped into json, which we don't know how to do in xsl
[11:13:31] <jzaefferer> well, Richard and Karl can probably figure it out
[11:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> What needs to be escaped? Quotes?
[11:13:49] <kswedberg> quotes and < and >
[11:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> Why does < need to be escaped for json?
[11:14:31] <kswedberg> dunno. maybe it's not a json issue but a build issue.
[11:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, does this mean that title is broken for anything containing a quote?
[11:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> Does the content in the dist directory look correct?
[11:15:36] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: no, it doesn't.
[11:15:41] <gnarf> quotes only
[11:15:45] <scott_gonzalez> What's it look like?
[11:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> Missing data or just unescaped quotes?
[11:16:30] <kswedberg> did you read the issue? :p
[11:16:35] <kswedberg> :However, it doesn't get everything from the <desc> node as it should. Instead, it stops when it encounters a tag inside of it."
[11:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm illiterate :-(
[11:17:00] <kswedberg> hehe
[11:17:05] <gnarf> kswedberg: if the tags are part of the desc, are they cdata?
[11:17:18] <gnarf> kswedberg: that might fix your "stops at a tag" issue
[11:17:31] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/56611/how-to-escape-xml-content-with-xsl-to-safely-output-it-as-json
[11:17:39] <gnarf> http://code.google.com/p/xml2json-xslt/
[11:17:51] <kswedberg> gnarf: they aren't cdata
[11:18:16] <gnarf> whats the "Tag" inside of it?
[11:18:19] <gnarf> like a <p> ?
[11:18:33] <kswedberg> gnarf: we already have a copy of that in the repo. again, from the issue: "My xsl-fu is not strong enough to figure out how to do this, but basically we need to import the xml2json template and then apply it to the contents of that <desc> node (which is the value of the excerpt prop."
[11:18:51] <kswedberg> <a href=""></a>
[11:19:17] <gnarf> so you need the tag and its children
[11:19:50] <kswedberg> here is what I did already to convert double quotes to single quotes: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L107-115
[11:20:29] * scott_gonzalez pulls down latest changes so I can be more helpful...
[11:20:33] <rworth> shouldn't we be escaping quotes, not converting them?
[11:21:17] <kswedberg> rworth, yeah, but  I couldn't figure out how to do that inside the tangled nest of quotes in the xslt
[11:21:30] <rworth> ok
[11:21:38] <kswedberg> I'm not at all saying I've done anything correctly.
[11:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? rworth: please update pygmentize to not force me ot use node 0.6.15
[11:22:11] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I blame grunt init
[11:22:20] <rworth> what should I put instead?
[11:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> 0.6.x or maybe 0.4.x or maybe *
[11:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> What APIs are you using?
[11:23:00] <rworth> child_process.spawn
[11:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> You're probably fine with *
[11:24:18] <rworth> ok
[11:24:42] <scott_gonzalez> I don't like how grunt handles versions.
[11:25:29] <scott_gonzalez> Can you make that changes, release 0.5.2 and update api.jquery.com?
[11:25:37] <rworth> 0.5.2 pushed
[11:25:41] <rworth> yeah
[11:25:44] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[11:26:55] <rworth> done
[11:30:32] <kswedberg> rworth: you gonna call me?
[11:30:46] <rworth> kswedberg was waiting for you to show online on skype
[11:31:13] <kswedberg> ooooh. ok, hold on
[11:31:33] <gnarf> kswedberg is invisible eh?
[11:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Which entry should I be looking at for an example of broken data?

[11:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> thanks

[11:38:20] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #163 on grunt (jzaefferer; 1m, 1w ago): init:node default for node version is too strict
[12:09:48] <rworth> got it worked out over skype. kswedberg is going to commit
[12:10:07] <rworth> fortunately we were able to import and apply the templates from xml2json, so no duplication :D
[12:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG, commit. The anticipation is killing me.
[12:15:24] <kswedberg> :)
[12:15:45] <kswedberg> gotta wrap the <desc> nodes that have nested elements with CDATA first
[12:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> That's it?
[12:16:44] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Didn't I ask about this the other day? I'm still confused about when we don't use CDATA.
[12:17:56] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: that's not it. there's also the importing of xlm2json and xsl:apply-templates
[12:17:57] <rworth> that's not all, but it's a related part of the solution we came up with
[12:18:28] <rworth> we weren't using CDATA in desc before, because it doesn't make it significantly simpler to author desc elements
[12:18:51] <rworth> we're using it now because it make it so the xml2json treats the contents of desc as a string and not a node hierarchy
[12:19:16] <rworth> in many cases we want a node hierarchy, so we can for example, select all anchor elements
[12:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> As long as it's fixed and I don't need to look at XSLT again :-)
[12:19:44] <rworth> :)
[12:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> I've done a really good job of avoiding it for the past 5 years.
[12:20:15] <rworth> you're better off for it
[12:20:17] <scott_gonzalez> Today was the first time I looked at it since two jobs ago.
[12:20:32] <rworth> fewer gray hairs in your future
[12:20:41] <kswedberg> xslt is an ugodly mess as far as I'm concerned
[12:45:15] <kswedberg> rworth: ran into a snag. files w/ 2 <entry> nodes.
[12:45:29] <kswedberg> for example… attr.xml
[12:45:30] <kswedberg> "excerpt": "Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements.""Set one or more attributes for the set of matched elements."
[12:46:17] <kswedberg> in particular, this … elements.""Set …
[13:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> PEOPLE! Who's around?
[13:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf jzaefferer kborchers rworth
[13:11:53] <gnarf> sup
[13:11:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: here but about to head out
[13:12:00] <gnarf> same
[13:12:18] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well this can wait, but I'll leave the idea here for now anyway :-)
[13:12:25] <gnarf> I'm dealing with wrapping my head around "Point inside Spherical Polygon" math
[13:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> What does everyone think about splitting releases again and guranteeing a release date of 1.10 before Feb 1?
[13:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's a big departure from how we've been planning our releases.
[13:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> The guarantee would be dialog API resdesign is done and the release happens before Feb.
[13:14:01] <scott_gonzalez> It would ensure that Drupal continues to use jQuery UI dialogs instead of writing their own.
[13:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> http://drupal.org/node/1175830#comment-6091686
[13:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> I really don't want other projects duplicating our efforts.
[13:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally they would just update our dialog instead of writing their own, but that just doesn't seem to happen.
[13:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on getting other projects to actually contribute back, but this seems like an easy way for us to address this.
[13:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> "easy"
[13:15:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'm in ... i think it's doable and necessary based on the size of the drupal user base
[13:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> This probably warrants a big discussion.
[13:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> But I wanted to get everyone's initial thoughts.
[13:16:13] <kborchers> probably
[13:16:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'm totally fine with adjusting our roadmap based on other big projects if it doesn't put undue stress on us.
[13:16:55] <gnarf> hrm
[13:16:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: my knee-jerk response is sure but would appreciate further discussion
[13:17:02] <gnarf> agree
[13:17:26] <gnarf> seems reasonable, especially if the drupal people can help us make what they need in dialog happen
[13:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> So dialog is already at the top of my list for 1.10 anyway.
[13:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> Which works well for this plan.
[13:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> Dialog and progressbar are the two widgets we've announced redesigns for that aren't in 1.9.
[13:20:49] <gnarf> "It's possible if we get a pull request in soon that it could land in 1.9, but the timelines are very short."
[13:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah. That's specifically about ARIA fixes.
[13:21:12] <gnarf> agree
[13:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> Not the entire dialog redesign.
[13:21:31] <gnarf> I'd love to see the ARIA fixes land in 1.9 if we can make it happen though :)
[13:23:45] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i would really like to see progressbar in 1.9 but probably not going to happen now i guess
[13:24:11] <kborchers> ok i have to head out ... i'll probably be online later
[13:30:24] <scott_gonzalez> nacin
[13:31:22] <nacin> huzzah. got it working. I owe you code.
[13:32:49] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:05:18] * rworth is back
[15:06:22] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: progress?
[15:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: For the post-receive hook on plugins.jquery.com, if I change node to run a server, we can have nginx pass it through, right?
[15:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> The URL will be http://plugins.jquery.com/_update so it'd normally go to WordPress.
[18:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is it done?
[18:30:10] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so menubar is broken because we removed stopImmediatePropagation from Menu
[18:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[18:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> Does menubar need to know about internal menu state now?
[18:32:22] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i think so. it needs to know i'm trying to open a submenu with right arrow instead of move to the next menubar item
[18:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like you could figure that out from within menubar.
[18:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> Check if the active item has a submenu.
[18:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> Probably just need to duplicate a check that menu is doing.
[18:33:24] <kborchers> yeah ... just figured out the cause so just wanted to give you a quick laugh :)
[18:33:27] <scott_gonzalez> I assume it's like 3-5 LOC
[18:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> oh, heh
[18:33:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it wsa a mixture of "oh man, that's funny" and "oh god, I hope we're not fucked"
[18:34:01] <kborchers> shouldn't be hard to fix
[18:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> good :-)
[18:34:20] <scott_gonzalez> I can't handle more insanity tonight.
[18:34:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm reviewing all of the tabs ARIA code again right now.
[18:34:52] <kborchers> that sounds fun
[18:35:00] <scott_gonzalez> Just had a long, frustrating converation with Hans.
[18:35:08] <scott_gonzalez> Hans wasn't frustrating, the topic was.
[18:35:09] <kborchers> saw your tweet about just using one OS, browser and AT
[18:35:28] <kborchers> i think that's a reasonable request
[18:35:29] <scott_gonzalez> Did you see http://twitter.com/scott_gonzalez/status/210893271461924864?
[18:35:30] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from scott_gonzalez: @toddmparker My concern with VoiceOver is the tight integration with the OS. ARIA cannot behave like native apps :-( ★ http://bit.ly/LcvzwU
[18:35:45] <kborchers> no, missed that one
[18:35:48] <scott_gonzalez> WTF VoiceOver? You just go in and change native behavior?!?
[18:36:28] <scott_gonzalez> Check this out. Open System Prefernces -> Languages & Text (first
[18:36:31] <scott_gonzalez> (first row)
[18:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> Move focus to the tabs and use the arrows to navigate.
[18:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> This is where I got the idea for delayed activation from.
[18:37:08] <scott_gonzalez> Now open VoiceOver and do the same thing.
[18:38:09] <kborchers> i can't seem to navigate the tabs with arrows :/
[18:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you probably don't have "make the keyboard useful" turned on.
[18:41:17] <scott_gonzalez> System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts.
[18:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> At the bottom, there's a label that says "Full keyboard access"
[18:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> Check the radio button for "all controls"
[18:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> It makes OS X usable.
[18:42:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: holy crap! i have been frustrated with that for ever!
[18:42:47] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea why that's not the default setting.
[18:43:18] <scott_gonzalez> What should we do to make the UX better? I know! Let's make it impossible to get to half of the controls in the UI!
[18:43:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i just figured if it wasn't there it wasn't there ... never thought it would be something that was turned off
[18:43:57] <scott_gonzalez> They've got proffessional cleaners in Panera tonight.
[18:44:03] <scott_gonzalez> But I haven't been kicked out yet :-P
[18:45:24] <kborchers> nice
[18:45:38] <kborchers> yeah, just saw the tabs stuff ... delay does make sense
[18:49:37] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if we should check event handlers in domEqual().
[18:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> And .data()
[18:50:41] <scott_gonzalez> MOAR TESTS
[19:00:31] <kborchers> heh
[19:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> I just added this locally:
[19:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> result.events = $._data( elem[ 0 ], "events" );
[19:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> 		result.data = $.extend( {}, elem.data() );
[19:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> The need to $.extend() on .data() surprised me.
[19:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> But it makes sense.
[19:02:46] <scott_gonzalez> I thought about this because I just noticed that I left some events on the tabs.
[19:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> Because I wanted to specifically handle disabled tabs.
[19:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> So I couldn't use _bind()
[19:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> And I forgot to namespace.
[19:03:08] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
