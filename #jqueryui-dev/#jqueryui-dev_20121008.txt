[01:29:20] <jzaefferer> kborchers: worksforme - can probably just put that out there without bothering with ThemeRoller integration. If someone really really needs a different colored gif, they can just use whatever they want with a CSS override
[01:38:51] <toxz> hi! can somebody help me getting my datepicker back to work after a body update? example: http://jsfiddle.net/Yhbuv/
[01:39:13] <toxz> i tried the "refresh" and "remove" options but nothing worked

[04:34:41] <kborchers> jzaefferer: but that's the beauty of what i changed here. i'm just dropping a transparent gif over the default progressbar so the bar itself is themed and then the animation plays over it so no need to theme the gif :)
[04:36:22] <kborchers> i guess i should have described that better but i was trying to show that with the random color button
[04:43:45] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #57: STILL FAILING in 14 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/57/
[04:50:47] <jzaefferer> kborchers: okay, makes sense. I got distracted by the light/dark switch
[04:53:14] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i figured users would want a light and dark gif depending on the color of the bar. i guess my bigger concern other than just thoughts on the general idea of this change was that I added an option
[04:54:07] <kborchers> to choose if animation is used and if so, which gif is used
[04:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> I don't like the addition of an animation option.
[04:58:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: there it is … i was waiting for that response :)  thoughts on switching gifs without an option? have users add a class to the element?
[04:58:23] <scott_gonzalez> Using classes seems fine.
[04:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we should write the CSS so that we use the git for IE 7/8 and use CSS animations for everything else.
[04:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> s/git/gif/
[05:04:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmmm, that coould work … i'll see if i can rework it tonight to do that instead and see what we think. thanks
[05:19:08] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: How's download builder/ThemeRoller coming?
[05:19:13] <scott_gonzalez> Do you feel like it's ready?
[05:19:53] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, gd morning.. Refactoring TR layout was something that took lot of my time.. I finally made it. Now, I'm refactoring DLB layout
[05:19:58] <rxaviers> I think it will be quicker
[05:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:20:34] <scott_gonzalez> estimate?
[05:20:42] <rxaviers> that done, what needs to be done is sniff testing it in diff browsers and finish checking the bug list
[05:21:25] <rxaviers> my plan is to complete DLB layout refact this morning
[05:21:57] <rxaviers> snif test and bug list tonight
[05:22:35] <rxaviers> If I dont finish this tonight, I will have a better idea of the effort by then (at least)
[05:22:51] <rxaviers> I am flighting to USA tonight
[05:23:19] <rxaviers> so, I may be back online tomorrow night
[05:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: We're deploying today.
[05:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> It seemed good in browsers on Friday.
[05:24:12] <rxaviers> really? when I tested DLB in IE7 the layout was all messy.
[05:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> We can push changes afterward. The important thing is for it to work well in Chrome and Firefox.
[05:24:24] <rxaviers> ah! so, we're good
[05:24:29] <rxaviers> all that was for IE
[05:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> I checked IE7 the other day and it was working. Let me check again.
[05:24:47] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, get the layout changes in and we'll deploy after that.
[05:24:59] <scott_gonzalez> We can fix remaining old bugs later.
[05:25:21] <rxaviers> ok, is that ok if we fix any bug from the list later?
[05:25:26] <rxaviers> ah! great
[05:25:26] <rxaviers> ok
[05:25:45] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: The important thing is not to have regressions :-P
[05:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> Old bugs can stay for the release.
[05:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> If we strive for perfection, jzaefferer's head may explode :-)
[05:26:26] <rxaviers> hahha
[05:27:11] <rxaviers> I hope we dont have regressions in the functionality, that was very tested.. crossing fingers
[05:27:39] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, about the layout changes using floats, what a mess the code got. It was so much cleaner using position table.
[05:27:50] <rxaviers> I mean mess = lot extra divs
[05:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: We'll have the designers clean it up later :-)
[05:28:20] <rxaviers> but, it seems to be working very smoothly
[05:28:31] <rxaviers> :)
[05:28:58] <rxaviers> will finish changing TR to use float stuff
[05:29:01] <rxaviers> and let you know
[05:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> thanks

[09:03:30] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I've got it.
[09:03:41] <rxaviers> did you fix it?
[09:03:45] <scott_gonzalez> yeah

[09:03:48] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Fixed specificity of rules to account for extra .application selector. - Scott González
[09:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> I guess you added ".application" to a bunch of selectors.
[09:04:21] <scott_gonzalez> Which changed the specificity and killed some rules.
[09:04:33] <rxaviers> ouch
[09:04:39] <rxaviers> thks
[09:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> So I added #themeroller in front of a bunch of selectors.
[09:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> That was fun to track down :-)
[09:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on removing the sidebar from TR.
[09:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Once that fix is pushed, do you feel good about deploying?
[09:07:18] <rxaviers> for the functionality point of view, I do
[09:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> But not layout?
[09:08:40] <rxaviers> well, layout too. I've tested in firefox, chrome, opera and IE in win and mac via browserstack and linux in my machine
[09:08:43] <rxaviers> but, never knows
[09:09:19] <rxaviers> sniff I did = opened the browser and resized
[09:09:35] <rxaviers> didnt extensively tested download, playing with TR
[09:09:58] <rxaviers> I guess that is good cross-browser though
[09:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[09:12:37] <rxaviers> ok
[09:12:44] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> Hope you have a good flight.
[09:13:21] <rxaviers> thank you. Looking forward to seeing you guys all soon ;)
[09:13:35] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for getting all of this done. We'd probably still be a few weeks out from a release without it :-)
[09:14:10] <rxaviers> glad to know!
[09:14:15] <rxaviers> thks
[09:14:28] <rxaviers> hope I helped more than bothered
[09:14:28] <rxaviers> hehe

[09:14:40] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Upgrade download.jqueryui.com to 1.0.5-pre.4. - Scott González
[09:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> oy
[09:15:49] <scott_gonzalez> I pushed jqueryui.com before pushing web-base-template.
[09:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if that will kill the deploy.
[09:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, WordPress didn't seem to care.
[09:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[09:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> Should we set a max-width now?
[09:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> It looks about as wide as it can reasonably get on my 13" MBP.
[09:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> Also, the breakpoints should be changed now :-P
[09:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's based on window width and there's now a lot more space available.
[09:25:24] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: could also remove it for DB; we've got various lines wrapping

[10:00:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez:
[10:00:32] <scott_gonzalez> GNARF!
[10:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> Let's do this :-)
[10:01:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking that maybe we should start with api.jqueryui.com since if someone goes horribly wrong nobody will notice.
[10:01:02] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: okay, short list of what to do?
[10:01:09] <gnarf> fair :)
[10:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> deploy web-base-template, api.jqueryui.com, api.jqueryui.com/1.8, download.jqueryui.com, jqueryui.com, blog.jqueryui.com
[10:02:06] <scott_gonzalez> We already have old.jqueryui.com working, so there shouldn't be anything to do there.
[10:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> Skype call during deploy?
[10:03:22] <gnarf> sure
[10:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> Are you ready to do this now?
[10:04:46] <gnarf> sure, might need to afk for a few minutes
[10:04:50] <gnarf> but lets start
[10:05:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:08:24] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/3X0Y2I0z213u
[10:22:17] <jzaefferer> gnarf: looks like the same permission issue as before
[10:22:41] <gnarf> jzaefferer: we figured it out, we "sudo npm installed" even tho we were already root
[10:22:43] <gnarf> and it worked

[10:44:29] <jzaefferer> That's odd, I'm pretty sure we tested with tags before
[10:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, we've been working from tags for a while now.
[10:47:06] <jzaefferer> Should set grunt to not color output to make things a little more readable
[10:47:39] <jzaefferer> Scott, did you test DB with the 1.9 tag?
[10:47:49] <jzaefferer> It's on stage, right?

[12:11:11] <dtr> Congratulation on the release of 1.9 to all of you.
[12:16:25] <ryanneufeld> oh man, new hotness all over www.jqueryui.com

[12:20:34] <gnarf> look at jq01 go...
[12:21:05] <ryanneufeld> cdn populating?
[12:21:10] <gnarf> its using like 1/3 of a T1 worth of bandwidth and the worlds DNS hasn't even finished propagating
[12:21:18] <gnarf> thats the wordpress workhorse
[12:21:20] <gnarf> nacin: ^^^
[12:21:53] <nacin> what am I looking at
[12:22:16] <gnarf> jq01 graphs
[12:22:21] <gnarf> bandwidth/cpu
[12:22:29] <gnarf> seems on the incline, gonna start digging into it
[12:22:31] <gnarf> just interesting
[12:22:34] <gnarf> might be an issue
[12:22:50] <gnarf> memory is like super steady tho
[12:22:51] <gnarf> so awesome
[12:22:59] <nacin> load averages appear high, but not unreasonable
[12:23:08] <nacin> I can't speak to bandwidth - that'd be a traffic thing
[12:23:19] <nacin> I'm seeing 1.36, 1.38, 1.07 for load on jq01
[12:23:50] <_zoggy_> http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#default -- two default functionality demos listed
[12:24:02] <_zoggy_> it should say 'custom style'
[12:24:09] <gnarf> yeah - load looks nice
[12:24:22] <nacin> certainly makes sense the bandwidth went up from nothing, otherwise
[12:24:22] <_zoggy_> also missing space after label on that one
[12:26:05] <nacin> gnarf: seeing a few hundred hits per sec in the access logs
[12:26:12] <gnarf> yeah
[12:26:19] <gnarf> im pushing a change to the access logs in a sec
[12:26:44] <gnarf> to separate the jqueryui domains
[12:27:01] <gnarf> just testing conf right now
[12:32:04] <gnarf> _zoggy_: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues ?
[12:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: The double default demo bug is actually in jquery-ui
[12:35:54] <_zoggy_> k
[12:35:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's parsing the title from the demo.
[12:36:03] <gnarf> oh
[12:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> If you view source you'll see it.
[12:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> So that sucks, because it's going to be broken until 1.9.1 :-/
[12:36:29] <_zoggy_> when you fix that, you should also add the missing space after the 'Your age:' for it as well
[12:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I guess it's time to do the blog theme.
[12:37:09] <_zoggy_> man im not feeling this new theme.. gradiant overload.. reminds me of early 90s stuff
[12:37:33] <_zoggy_> mainly its the li styling
[12:38:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you need me to do that, or can you do the same thing you did on stage?
[12:38:21] <gnarf> its on the same machine
[12:38:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do it.
[12:39:11] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, note that http://jqueryui.com/spinner/#currency also is another default funcationality one
[12:40:07] <_zoggy_> and http://jqueryui.com/position/#cycler
[12:40:26] <nacin> gnarf: definitely seeing load averages tick up
[12:40:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2012/10/jquery-ui-1-9-0/
[12:40:52] <gnarf> nacin: i think i have a few solutions to try
[12:40:56] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: Do you want to send a PR for those?
[12:41:21] <scott_gonzalez> Should I hold off on Twitter while you guys investigate load?
[12:41:46] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, want me to post issue here? https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues ?
[12:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[12:42:14] <_zoggy_> one for each or one for all
[12:42:34] <scott_gonzalez> one for all, I'll have to make the changes in a different repo.
[12:42:39] <_zoggy_> ok
[12:43:21] <gnarf> heh
[12:43:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez:

[12:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? they're making requests to old?
[12:44:51] <gnarf> no
[12:45:04] <gnarf> we are just getting bombarded with 404s on those /ui urls
[12:45:26] <scott_gonzalez> oh, heh
[12:45:34] <gnarf> people hotlinking to our ui
[12:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> That site has been broken for a while.
[12:45:54] <scott_gonzalez> They're trying to load jQuery 1.7.2 from jqueryui.com...
[12:45:54] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/8
[12:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> thanks _zoggy_
[12:46:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: there are a few :)
[12:46:08] <_zoggy_> np
[12:46:19] <gnarf> its not just the one
[12:46:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: DNS should be everywhere now
[12:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I did the blog post.
[12:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> Should I announce on Twitter or do you want to investigate the load first.
[12:47:26] <scott_gonzalez> s/./?/
[12:47:50] <gnarf> go for it
[12:47:55] <gnarf> it should be stable
[12:50:26] <scott_gonzalez> http://twitter.com/jqueryui/status/255394657750634498
[12:50:32] <gnarf> its up to like a meg a second now tho
[12:56:43] <gnarf> nacin: if api.jqueryui.com is doing this to jq01, i'd hate to think whats going to happen when we throw api.jquery.com on it
[12:56:57] <nacin> we'll get it under control
[12:57:19] <nacin> mind you, I don't think there's any microcaching on this, either
[12:57:36] <nacin> we'll figure out what the biggest hogs are
[12:57:38] <gnarf> it should be
[12:59:12] <gnarf> the access log for jqueryui.com is already 65 megs
[13:00:21] <scott_gonzalez> whoa
[13:04:39] <nacin> average of 130 hits a sec
[13:06:28] <gnarf> on jqueryui.com only?
[13:06:31] <gnarf> or the whole site?

[15:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks to WordPress http://jqueryui.com/butt is now a functional URL :-P
[15:09:17] <gnarf> nacin: seems to be "calming down"
[15:33:11] <ajpiano> congratulations on getting the release out guys
[15:34:39] <ajpiano> sorry bout the complaints about the syntax highlighting not working in the hybrid pages - i recall working on trying to get that going in a past life (this summer)
[15:34:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: sausage fingers strike again, http://jqueryui.com/demos/ links to http://jqueryui.com/autocoplete/
[15:35:31] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: /demos/ is working fine for me
[15:35:47] <jzaefferer> yeah, but the Autocomplete link isbad
[15:35:47] <ajpiano> also, given the state of interactions vs widgets, maybe we should put widgets first in the left side nav
[15:36:10] <ajpiano> ohhh gotcha

[15:39:21] <gnarf> jzaefferer: fixed
[15:39:36] <jzaefferer> gnarf: nice, I got stick updating dependencies, trying to "test" the fix...
[15:39:40] <jzaefferer> *stuck
[15:39:41] <gnarf> jzaefferer: also, might want to add a test to download builder where it picks components that don't exist
[15:39:58] <gnarf> jzaefferer: because that was crashing the process earlier
[15:40:13] <jzaefferer> gnarf: Let's create tickets for that stuff, and keep them open when tests are still needed
[15:40:30] <gnarf> jzaefferer: k
[15:41:57] <gnarf> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/21
[15:43:13] <jzaefferer> gnarf: any thoughts on the general error handling? should we just reboot download builder whenever it crashes, hoping the issue was just for a specific request? Or add more error handling inside download builder to keep it alive longer?
[15:43:29] <jzaefferer> seems like a complete crash is pretty bad
[15:43:47] <gnarf> report error and continue serving - perhaps serve some 500
[15:43:52] <gnarf> for the broken request
[15:44:01] <gnarf> unless the error is like "no release to build"
[15:44:03] <gnarf> or whatever
[15:44:12] <gnarf> then it should just die
[15:44:28] <gnarf> also
[15:44:39] <gnarf> it would be nice if it logged out that it serves a build
[15:44:51] <gnarf> maybe list of components, version, something
[15:49:05] <jzaefferer> I replied to your ticket on that matter
[15:49:27] <jzaefferer> We have to do a full code review to find all places that can throw errors to make sure we bubble those up to the right place

[15:51:37] <gnarf> jzaefferer: nice
[15:55:07] <jzaefferer> gnarf: pushes to jqueryui.com/master get deployed instantly to live?
[15:55:22] <gnarf> jzaefferer: when you push a tag with it
[15:55:26] <jzaefferer> like this commit went live directly? https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/commit/363dc17874cde4e245fb441310173df90d8c8a86
[15:55:31] <jzaefferer> or did you deploy that manually?
[15:55:33] <gnarf> jzaefferer: master -> stage ;; tag -> live
[15:55:41] <jzaefferer> I didn't see you push a tag
[15:55:41] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i tagged it 1.9.0-3 and pushed
[15:55:52] <gnarf> the irc bot doesn't show pushed tags
[15:55:55] <gnarf> dunno why
[15:55:57] <jzaefferer> oh, okay
[15:56:02] <gnarf> but since there isn't a "tagging ...." commit
[15:56:06] <gnarf> you wouldn't see it
[15:56:10] <jzaefferer> says 1.9.0-1 though
[15:56:19] <gnarf> -3 was for download
[15:56:25] <gnarf> i just used the wrong number
[15:56:36] <gnarf> i did whatever the next build # was :)
[15:56:45] <jzaefferer> looking at https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/tags
[15:57:00] <jzaefferer> has your commit message, but −1, not -3
[15:57:06] <gnarf> -1 it is then
[15:57:28] <gnarf> ive pushed 1.9.0-\d to like 3 repos today
[15:57:30] <jzaefferer> heh, okay
[15:57:36] <gnarf> got my version # confused :)
[15:57:45] <jzaefferer> ah, −3 for download.jqueryui.com
[15:57:47] <jzaefferer> got it
[16:02:09] <jzaefferer> looks like the important stuff is under control
[16:14:24] <jzaefferer> ah, needed -t due to the standalone commit...
[16:21:52] <gnarf> yup
[17:57:03] <btimby1> Howdy, I have a problem with the new jQuery UI, it is great except one small detail. The themes are not compatible with the previous version. We have approaching one hundred themes for our customers. I need to create a new one, but can't create one with themeroller. I also can't update jQuery UI to 1.9.0 without breaking all existing themes. Any body know how to access the old themeroller?
[18:04:04] <scott_gonzalez> btimby1: old.jqueryui.com/download
[18:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> We can't guarantee back-compat on themes.
[18:05:15] <btimby1> @scott_gonzalez Thanks, that is exactly what I was unable to find using Google!
[18:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> We're not doing a good enough job, so far only two people have claimed to have thrown up after seeing the new site :-P

[23:12:57] <_zoggy_> reading that blog post, there is a link that isnt working
[23:12:58] <_zoggy_> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9#api-redesigns
[23:13:05] <_zoggy_> As mentioned above, many plugins went through API redesigns. As a result, many existing APIs were deprecated. These APIs will be removed in 1.10.0. The 1.9.0 release includes a flag to disable all deprecated APIs, allowing you to determine if your code is ready for 1.10.0 even before it is released. There are full details on how to use the flag in the upgrade guide.
