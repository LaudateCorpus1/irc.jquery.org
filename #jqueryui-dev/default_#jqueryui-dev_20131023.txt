[07:40:52] <uGoMobi> thanks
[07:42:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the expected result is that fixed toolbars and the wrapper transition when you open a panel, and they should not disappear when the panel is completely open
[07:42:20] <arschmitz> ok

[07:46:05] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:46:29] <arschmitz> thats perfectly reasonable
[07:47:23] <uGoMobi> interesting part is that it doesn't happen when you set @-ms-viewport { width: device-width; }
[07:47:42] <uGoMobi> but because of a bug in IE device-width is wrong

[09:32:00] <doesallmagic2> Mike Sherov: Draggable Tests: Ensure Draggable tests are correctly testing offset under scroll conditions.
[10:29:17] <jzaefferer> rxaviers fnagel tj_vantoll: an overview of what $.date currently contains: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/1bcd5ee30954f28880ca
[10:29:47] <jzaefferer> its custom tailored for datepicker, but can be used to render something like Google Calendar, with appointments in each table cell
[10:30:20] <jzaefferer> fnagel suggested to add this as a module to Globalize. That seems pretty reasonable to me. It depends on Globalize and can live there as a module.
[10:32:34] <jzaefferer> any thoughts on the above?
[10:33:41] <rxaviers> Ok, I am understanding this is something more high level than Globalize.
[10:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> Seems that way to me as well.
[10:36:26] <rxaviers> And I suppose you don't want to include that in Globalize to keep it dry...
[10:37:47] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it's a DRY issue, but it seems like a layer on top to me.
[10:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> Unless there's going to be other date methods, beyond just getting the raw data.
[10:40:13] <jzaefferer> I actually like the idea to include it in Globalize
[10:40:39] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: there are other methods, see my gist for some basic API docs
[10:41:05] <jzaefferer> specifically adjust()
[10:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I meant are there other date methods in Globalize.
[10:41:54] <jzaefferer> What does "date methods" mean?
[10:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> Methods that act on dates.
[10:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> Like the stuff that's in $.date right now.
[10:42:23] <rxaviers> At first glance, it seems like it's a helper object for datepicker rather than a general purpose lib
[10:42:32] <rxaviers> like momentjs
[10:42:50] <jzaefferer> its a helper object for calendars, not just datepickers
[10:43:09] <rxaviers> how would you name it?
[10:46:37] <jzaefferer> Let's ignore the name for the moment
[10:46:59] <jzaefferer> we'll have to figure that out anyway, though it'll be easier with Globalize as the host
[10:49:09] <rxaviers> naming it is part of defining its role.. :P
[10:50:22] <rxaviers> but, ok I understood what you need..
[10:50:42] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what are existing names within Globalize?
[10:50:58] <jzaefferer> I can figure that out myself
[10:51:10] <fnagel> to me its a general purpose lib (I tried to use $.date once and ended up using third party datetime lib)
[10:53:35] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: src/datetime/calendar.js might work
[10:53:51] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: btw. I think this module is too small: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/blob/CLDR/src/datetime/pattern-re.js
[10:54:01] <rxaviers> on purpose
[10:54:06] <rxaviers> it helps the build process
[10:54:14] <jzaefferer> how is that?
[10:55:01] <rxaviers> I am following jquery's build process. That pattern-re.js whole define wrappers gets replaced by a var patternRe = x;
[10:55:39] <rxaviers> which leads to good minified files later. Because the variable name patternRe gets fully minified
[10:55:41] <jzaefferer> you could just inline that into format.js instead of having a separate module
[10:55:57] <rxaviers> that's gonna be used in parse
[10:56:00] <rxaviers> as well
[10:56:04] <jzaefferer> you'd get the same result, but I wouldn't have to open another file just to see what the regex looks like
[10:56:30] <jzaefferer> maybe that module can take over some more stuff to justify its existence...
[10:56:48] <jzaefferer> something to revisit when you implemented parsing then
[10:57:04] <fnagel> usecase: need to show different formats (locales) based upon a timestamp or a UTC date object. How would you advise people? Use Globalize for time and XYZ for dates?
[10:57:47] <jzaefferer> fnagel: that's both usecase for Globalize as-is
[10:58:00] <jzaefferer> *usecases
[10:58:45] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, it's singular on purpose. Perhaps, this helps to understand why https://github.com/rxaviers/cldr/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L92
[11:00:15] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay
[11:00:23] <rxaviers> basically, this build process has been extracted from current jquery core, and my plan is to make the same on globalize as well. By having files with singular responsibility this way, I consider it a `type a (single return)` file. If I include the patter-re.js file embedded in the format file, I would have to add an exception in the build process here https://github.com/rxaviers/cldr/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L109
[11:00:28] <jzaefferer> without any reuse it still seems questionable
[11:01:40] <jzaefferer> browsing a project that has hundreds of tiny modules like that seems like a really bad idea
[11:01:51] <jzaefferer> (off for dinner)
[11:01:57] <rxaviers> Perhaps browsing, I agree.
[11:02:05] <rxaviers> But, it produces the smallest bundle.
[11:02:41] <rxaviers> and, at least, have a very consistent way to define files
[11:02:41] <rxaviers> :)
[11:03:05] <rxaviers> well, Im completely open to suggestions. Just saying why I did it this way
[11:19:05] <fnagel> jzaefferer: nice, thanks for the info
[11:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Is this still something you need me to look at? http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu#commentnum1380450097
[11:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure which current vs. old solution needs to be compared.
[11:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, "hamburger icon"
[11:57:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[11:57:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[11:57:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "The framework styles the list items as buttons like the other list types but without a gradient on the background." This is no longer true for static list items.
[11:58:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How would you describe the difference between static and <li><a
[11:58:07] <_|Nix|_> ?
[11:58:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Differently coloured backroung?
[11:58:21] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[11:58:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, static list items get the ui-body-x class now
[11:58:24] <_|Nix|_> Background
[11:58:35] <uGoMobi> body theme instead of button theme
[11:58:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aha, as opposed to ui-btn-x, right?
[11:58:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Cool!
[11:58:51] <uGoMobi> s/style/theme/
[11:58:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[11:59:20] <uGoMobi> grrr... s/theme/style/ I meant ;-)
[11:59:31] <uGoMobi> theme, style, swatch... complicated :-/
[12:00:47] <_|Nix|_> Indeed.
[12:01:05] <_|Nix|_> Having trouble expressing it: "The framework styles the list items as buttons like the other list types but the background color is that which is specified for the body (<code>ui-body-a</code>) rathen than for the button (<code>ui-btn-a</code>)."
[12:01:31] <_|Nix|_> Having trouble expressing it: "The framework styles the list items as buttons like the other list types but the background color is set to that which is specified for the body (<code>ui-body-a</code>) rathen than for the button (<code>ui-btn-a</code>)."
[12:02:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well ,they are not styled as buttons anymore
[12:02:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, no? No ui-corner-all? No ui-shadow?
[12:03:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so they are styled exactly the same as <li><a except they get ui-body-x and not ui-btn-x, right?
[12:04:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "The framework styles static list items identically to list items containing links, but static items receive the body background color (<code>ui-body-a</code>) rather than the button background color (<code>ui-btn-a</code>)."
[12:04:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm... they do get shadow and corner
[12:04:46] <uGoMobi> one moment... on the phone... brb
[12:05:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I think the latter formulation should work then.
[12:34:45] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: Not sure about that one. He did not comment again and the issue itself is fixed atm
[12:37:43] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Ok, I'll just delete the associated comments then.
[12:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Did you get a chance to look at the globals PR?
[12:55:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... it seems hidedividers isn't working as advertised ... http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/api.jquerymobile.com/resources/listview/example17.html
[12:58:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: K, NM ... I think I have to hide by adding ui-screen-hidden, not by calling .hide()
[13:01:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep. All clear!
