[07:40:52] <agcolom> uGoMobi: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.2/jquery.mobile-1.3.2.zip goes to 404. was alerted by Raymond Camden on twitter
[07:41:04] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah I just saw the tweet
[07:41:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the link seems ok
[07:41:14] <agcolom> ok :-)
[07:41:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: so I think the ZIP is not on the CDN
[07:41:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you around?
[07:41:33] <agcolom> I get 404 as well on the zip 
[07:41:40] <uGoMobi> me too
[07:41:52] <arschmitz> hi
[07:41:59] <uGoMobi> link is same a previous releases, just changed version
[07:42:01] <agcolom> btw, I need to update the footer of the api docs, as this still shows 1.3.1
[07:42:02] <uGoMobi> hi Alex
[07:42:07] <agcolom> Hi Alex :-)
[07:42:32] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that's in the WordPress template I guess?
[07:42:47] <agcolom> yes, it's not in the api docs repo
[07:42:50] <arschmitz> ill check the zip thats auto generated and uplaoded by the release script
[07:43:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks
[07:43:08] <uGoMobi> this is the url http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.2/jquery.mobile-1.3.2.zip
[07:44:44] <arschmitz> it is indeed missing
[07:44:53] <arschmitz> on the server
[07:45:06] <arschmitz> everything else is there so not sure what happened
[07:45:56] <arschmitz> hmmm looks like the release script is actually missing that step
[07:46:05] <uGoMobi> weird
[07:48:39] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:53:35] <arschmitz> ok its there now
[07:54:00] <arschmitz> i manually uploaded it will check with gseguin on monday because as far as i can see the script should have done it
[07:54:18] <arschmitz> but i still happned to have the log of it running open and it seems to have just skipped it for some reason
[07:55:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, link works now... thanks!
[07:55:33] <arschmitz> no problem
[07:56:09] <agcolom> thank you both! what a team!
[07:56:26] <arschmitz> agcolom: did you submit a talk for austin i vaguely remember you mentioning it i think?
[07:56:30] <agcolom> uGoMobi: The footer is not up to date on stage
[07:56:41] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes, I did and got accepted!
[07:56:47] <agcolom> how about you?
[07:56:48] <arschmitz> nice me too!
[07:56:56] <agcolom> fantastic!
[07:57:01] <agcolom> what are you talking about?
[07:57:09] <arschmitz> optimizing jqm
[07:57:11] <arschmitz> for performance
[07:57:18] <agcolom> nice!
[07:57:34] <arschmitz> probably our single biggest complaint so thought it would be good to give some tips
[07:57:42] <agcolom> have to go to take my son to his horse riding lesson...
[07:57:49] <agcolom> yes, great idea! :-)
[07:57:50] <uGoMobi> cool that you both going to do  talk in Austin
[07:57:51] <arschmitz> ok have fun
[07:57:57] <agcolom> thx :-)
[07:59:00] <agcolom> uGoMobi: there's another 404 from the blog...
[07:59:10] <uGoMobi> ohw :(
[07:59:14] <uGoMobi> what link?
[07:59:46] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/10/02/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-3-2-final/
[08:00:15] <agcolom> because it should be http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/07/19/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-3-2/
[08:00:21] <agcolom> I think?
[08:00:39] <agcolom> on http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/07/19/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-3-2/ at the top there's a small 1.3 link
[08:00:42] <agcolom> that's the one
[08:01:11] <uGoMobi> yeah
[08:01:16] <uGoMobi> updated
[08:01:50] <uGoMobi> hmm, still not good
[08:02:23] <uGoMobi> ah, should have been 1-3-0-final
[08:03:17] <agcolom> yes I was going to say, I gave you the wrong pointing location!
[08:04:00] <uGoMobi> 1-3-0-released even
[08:04:32] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/02/20/jquery-mobile-1-3-0-released/
[08:04:34] <agcolom> yes
[08:05:07] <uGoMobi> ok, works now
[08:05:14] <uGoMobi> thanks agcolom !
[08:05:15] <agcolom> yep! 
[08:05:34] <agcolom> no pb :-) just lucky I was just checking twitter!
[08:05:42] <uGoMobi> :)
[08:06:15] <agcolom> so the footer is ok on stage but not sure how that get deployed to live... Will check with scott_gonzalez on monday
[08:06:15] <uGoMobi> there is a WordPress plugin that checks broken links if I am not mistaken.. we need that :)
[08:06:40] <uGoMobi> ok perfect
[08:06:52] <agcolom> yes, I remember toddmparker talking about it. but I don't think we use that... 
[08:07:24] <uGoMobi> we can add when we switch to new WordPress theme

[11:10:14] <_|Nix|__> uGoMobi: Ping!
[11:10:17] <_|Nix|__> arschmitz: ^
[11:15:12] <_|Nix|_> It's about the filterable. When it was part of listview, it had access to all its styling attributes like theme and inset. This is no longer the case. So, we might have to special case the situation where a non-inset listview is being filtered to stay backwards compat with the extension.
[14:12:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmmm dont like the sound of it but not sure the workaround here

[14:41:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : yeah, we have to come up with a solution for inset listview filter
[14:41:35] <uGoMobi> how does theming work with the filterable widget?
[14:42:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i wonder if the solution here might just be wait for 1.5 .....
[14:42:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: then we could depracate the listview filter extension and not worry about backcompat
[14:43:17] <arschmitz> keep the extension in a seperate repo and link it up
[14:43:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that is a solution, but then it would still be nice if people can give the filter the inset style
[14:43:40] <arschmitz> yeah it would just be an option on filter at that point
[14:43:47] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:43:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we could even do like with flip
[14:43:55] <arschmitz> and have both for one version
[14:44:29] <arschmitz> and because its a whole new widget we can make it how we want with out the worry of backcompt
[14:44:54] <uGoMobi> not a bad idea
[14:45:10] <uGoMobi> but I think both use data-filter="true"
[14:45:27] <arschmitz> make it filterable
[14:45:30] <uGoMobi> I don't see any theme option in the filterable.js
[14:46:08] <arschmitz> yeah it should have its own option set including theme seperate from what its attached to
[14:46:41] <uGoMobi> right, but I also don't see how it gets its theme from what it's attached to
[14:46:56] <arschmitz> hmmmm actually i take that back
[14:47:04] <arschmitz> because it does not create any elements
[14:47:09] <arschmitz> it just attaches theme
[14:47:13] <uGoMobi> that's what _|Nix|_ said
[14:47:21] <arschmitz> the input gets its theme from textinput
[14:47:27] <arschmitz> and the options you set there
[14:47:36] <uGoMobi> huh
[14:47:50] <arschmitz> its what we talked about before
[14:48:02] <arschmitz> where you set like a listview to filterable
[14:48:15] <arschmitz> then set a data-target to an id of an input
[14:48:25] <arschmitz> so it does not styleing
[14:48:37] <arschmitz> all the style stuff is just for backcompat
[14:48:40] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:48:59] <uGoMobi> I see the depracted note
[14:49:10] <arschmitz> so really filterable should not do any dom manip on create this way either
[14:49:29] <arschmitz> or have to even call any other widgets internally
[14:49:46] <arschmitz> then all it does is connect an input to a data source
[14:49:54] <uGoMobi> right
[14:50:40] <arschmitz> also then its only dependency is widget factory
[14:51:20] <arschmitz> pretty sure this is where _|Nix|_ was basicly going with it
[14:51:28] <arschmitz> just he was worried about backcompat
[14:51:58] <arschmitz> but its so different then listview filter i think we just deprecate that and add this as something completely new 
[14:51:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I like the idea of having both in 1.4
[14:52:18] <arschmitz> yeah i think it makes sense
[14:52:25] <arschmitz> we just need to use 2 different init selectors
[14:52:26] <uGoMobi> so we don't have to worry about the backwards compatibility
[14:52:39] <uGoMobi> and introduce the new filterable widget how we want it
[14:52:53] <arschmitz> also filterable actualy makes more sense for init selector because with new autoinit it will default to widget name
[14:53:01] <uGoMobi> otherwise we land it and next release already completely change it
[14:53:18] <uGoMobi> right
[14:53:26] <uGoMobi> data-role="filterable"
[14:53:36] <arschmitz> yup
[14:54:27] <arschmitz> i think this is the right direction and keep to our new goal of making things as modular and decoupled as possible
[14:54:43] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:55:19] <uGoMobi> and for 1.5 we review listview and can remove some code in there that is meant for the filter extension
[14:55:26] <uGoMobi> triggers an event
[14:55:32] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:55:46] <uGoMobi> ok, sounds like a plan
[14:55:47] <arschmitz> thats actually something in general many of our widgets are missing
[14:55:57] <arschmitz> they should trigger more custom events for hooks
[14:56:04] <arschmitz> but thats for another day
[14:56:12] <uGoMobi> yup
[14:57:25] <arschmitz> gseguin's release script makes a release really easy that iv done
[14:57:53] <arschmitz> normally i could do a release in like 10 minutes
[14:57:56] <arschmitz> no problem
[14:58:08] <uGoMobi> nice
[14:58:30] <arschmitz> something to keep in mind for maitnence releases for sure
[14:59:16] <uGoMobi> I want to include changelog and supported platforms in the demo center somewhere
[14:59:29] <arschmitz> thats easy enough
[14:59:36] <uGoMobi> supported platforms because it is version specific
[14:59:42] <arschmitz> yup
[14:59:53] <uGoMobi> and changelog makes that a blog post takes very long
[15:00:06] <uGoMobi> can look at UI's changelog script
[15:00:13] <arschmitz> yeah
[15:01:17] <uGoMobi> for 1.4 alpha I there are more than 600 commits
[15:01:24] <arschmitz> for 1.4 we have a LOT to add to supported platforms
[15:01:32] <uGoMobi> only next branch was already 400 commits
[15:01:35] <arschmitz> lol and some branches are not even merged yet
[15:01:40] <uGoMobi> exactly
[15:01:46] <uGoMobi> that's crazy
[15:01:47] <uGoMobi> lol
[15:02:02] <arschmitz> good little stat for blog post though
[15:02:16] <arschmitz> about how much work we have done for 1.4
[15:02:27] <uGoMobi> yeah for sure
[15:02:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BTW the new flip switch is completely broken on IE8 :/
[15:02:57] <arschmitz> oh no
[15:03:03] <arschmitz> like the js or style
[15:03:04] <uGoMobi> not sure if it's because of something I have done
[15:03:09] <uGoMobi> style
[15:03:20] <uGoMobi> don't see a button there
[15:03:28] <arschmitz> :| could have been either of us i had not checked ie8 in a while
[15:03:37] <arschmitz> it worked when i started
[15:03:43] <arschmitz> but that was a while back
[15:03:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you have the link to the source you used for this as inspiration?
[15:04:00] <arschmitz> yup i think so
[15:04:21] <uGoMobi> would be nice if you have to for me so I can look at what's different
[15:04:29] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/814/edit
[15:04:31] <uGoMobi> s/to/that/
[15:04:52] <arschmitz> thats the original one i did as proof of concept
[15:04:54] <uGoMobi> great, thanks!
[15:06:05] <arschmitz> just checked that one appears to be pretty much pixel perfect in ie8
[15:06:18] <arschmitz> so something went bad inbetween
[15:06:30] <uGoMobi> can be just one simple setting
[15:06:34] <arschmitz> yeah
[15:06:37] <uGoMobi> I dunno
[15:06:45] <uGoMobi> but now I can compare
[15:06:52] <arschmitz> and i did change how the whole css worked
[15:07:16] <arschmitz> so i probably changed something that broke it for ie8
[15:07:37] <uGoMobi> will let you know when I found out what it was
[15:07:46] <arschmitz> cool hopefully its simple
[15:08:14] <arschmitz> does it like drop to 2 lines?
[15:08:20] <arschmitz> and look kinda funky?
[15:12:51] <uGoMobi> i remember it didn't have  button at all
[15:13:05] <uGoMobi> and I think I only got to see the "off" label
[15:13:30] <uGoMobi> does that sound funky? ;)
[15:52:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: You guys still around?
