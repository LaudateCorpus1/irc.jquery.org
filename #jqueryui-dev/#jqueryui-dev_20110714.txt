[08:08:57] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu: Check if submenu is already open and if so, don't call open again. Fixes Firefox bug where a mouseover of an icon adjusted the position of a submenu by a half pixel - kborchers

[08:10:52] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu: Fix formatting and whitespace (was supposed to update previous commit) - Jörn Zaefferer
[08:14:28] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yt?
[08:15:28] <jzaefferer> yep
[08:15:38] <jzaefferer> just commented on menu_collapse PR
[08:16:12] <jzaefferer> can you take out the escape key handling? that way I can merge the rest and we can figure out how to handle escape key correctly
[08:16:35] <kborchers> will do
[08:17:13] <kborchers> i was going to update the todos on the wiki, if i delete them, should i update the numbering or leave as is since they are referenced later in the page?
[08:17:27] <kborchers> or update throughout?
[08:17:44] <jzaefferer> just killed entry 2 and 3 /o\
[08:17:53] <kborchers> ok, nevermind then ;)
[08:17:57] <jzaefferer> where are they referenced?
[08:18:46] <kborchers> maybe they aren't  ... might have been in a comment i already deleted or i was just imagining it
[08:20:21] <jzaefferer> btw. are you on twitter?
[08:20:38] <jzaefferer> obviously you aren't kborchers there
[08:20:53] <jzaefferer> or G+?
[08:22:34] <kborchers> @k_borchers on twitter and kris.borchers on G+, though I still haven't done anything with that yet. want @kborchers since that one has been dead for years but they won't release it. i follow you on twitter
[08:22:56] <jzaefferer> aye, I see
[08:23:59] <jzaefferer> eh, when I use the search field on G+, it opens a random regular google search with no results..
[08:24:00] <jzaefferer> meh
[08:24:22] <jzaefferer> do you have your "id" at hand?
[08:28:02] <jzaefferer> kborchers, updated commit looks good, but the message still includes escape handling
[08:28:13] <jzaefferer> wanna push that? otherwise I'll cherry-pick..
[08:29:15] <kborchers> hmmm, I updated the commit message but the message in the PR didn't change. i'll fix it, just a sec
[08:29:32] <kborchers> how's that?
[08:30:33] <kborchers> what do you mean by id? for G+? i'm still learning how that all works. i created a new circle and added you to it. does that help?
[08:35:39] <jzaefferer> ah, good point, I only looked at the PR message, that isn't important
[08:39:29] <kborchers> jzaefferer: with that close on escape, what if we bind it on menu open and unbind on menu close?
[08:39:45] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/mX3XXX
[08:39:45] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu: Changed closeAll to collapseAll and updated in Menubar, also updated a reference to left in Menubar to collapse. - kborchers
[08:40:12] <jzaefferer> kborchers, that sounds reasonable
[08:40:29] <kborchers> just have to take multiple menus into account ...
[08:40:33] <jzaefferer> that's what tooltip now does: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/2803417dc44c6147cee14f46ba0ccfa29218a257
[08:40:51] <jzaefferer> well, except that tooltip binds to target element...
[08:41:11] <jzaefferer> considering that, binding to menu itself instead of document makes sense
[08:41:20] <jzaefferer> if you use the mouse, you can just click elsewhere to close
[08:41:27] <jzaefferer> not an option for keyboard usage
[08:41:37] <jzaefferer> makes sense?
[08:41:45] <kborchers> so this should only work once the menu has focus?
[08:42:19] <kborchers> open with mouseover won't bind the escape key?
[08:43:16] <kborchers> i'll put something together and we can go from there
[08:44:15] <kborchers> gotta leave for a meeting. i'll be back in about an hour. thanks for the help
[11:30:24] <kborchers[A]> jzaefferer: there?
[12:13:09] <jzaefferer> kborchers, I'm here
[12:15:27] <kborchers> do we know the appropriate function of the escape key for menus in terms of accessibility? i ask because currently, escape is already bound to close the current submenu and then it stops propagation and prevents default so my collapseAll is never called on escape
[12:19:52] <kborchers> jzaefferer: hmm, my code doesn't work even if i take out the other bind so that may not be the issue but the question about what is correct still stands.
[12:40:53] <kborchers> jzaefferer: figured out my code and that other bind is blocking it so i think we need to decide if escape closes current submenu or all because it obviously can't do both
[13:01:35] <jzaefferer> okay, sounds like we should just keep the current behaviour then
[13:03:55] <kborchers> agreed, thanks
