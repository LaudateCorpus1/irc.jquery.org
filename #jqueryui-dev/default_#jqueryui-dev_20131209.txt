[00:44:33] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Will the gradient option still exist in 1.4.0 themeroller? (I saw a guy complain on twitter), not in a very nice way...

[00:45:19] <b-ot> agcolom: @dkarlins: The #jQueryMobile team removed the OPTION of gradients from #themes "to give it a more modern look." Can an adult get appointed to the team?

[06:57:40] <gnarf> cc scott_gonzalez ^^
[07:00:13] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't realize we let that domain die.
[07:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> But it's awesome that it has the Kherington look alike :-)
[07:08:42] <gnarf> i didn't either
[07:09:23] <gnarf> i don't remember seeing any emails from namecheap about it
[07:09:40] <gnarf> and we have auto-renew setup for all of the domains
[07:09:41] <gnarf> so
[07:10:02] <gnarf> i figure either a) it wasn't registered with our normal registrar, or b) we chose to let it go
[07:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> B) is probably true
[07:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: Thanks for looking into http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9688, I'm going to add it to this week's agenda.
[07:29:08] <tj_vantoll1> scott_gonzalez: No problem and sounds good.

[08:33:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I remember seeing the Kherington look alike before, but what was the story behind that? Can't remember...
[08:34:18] <scott_gonzalez> She's just some stock photography chick.
[08:34:37] <scott_gonzalez> Who apparently ends up on a lot of domains we stop hosting.
[08:34:39] <scott_gonzalez> But she looks just like Kherington Payne.
[08:34:57] <scott_gonzalez> Who is one of my favorite people from So You Think You Can Dance.
[08:36:09] <jzaefferer> I see :-)
[08:36:20] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: any ETA on 1.4.0 final?
[08:37:36] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: tomorrow or Wednesday
[08:39:06] <jzaefferer> Cool, thanks
[09:30:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Are you able to reproduce https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/162 or https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/165?
[09:30:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you cannot reproduce https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/165 we can close it. Not so for the other one, however, because I suspect we may have to turn off history in the TR iframe.
[09:32:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm currently downloading the version of Chrome necessary for reproducing https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/162
[10:31:44] <agcolom> uGoMobi: re gradient: but I guess anyone could create gradients manually in CSS for any element right?
[10:45:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will test those TR issues
[10:46:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, or you can copy them from your 1.3 theme
[10:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Unfortunately when dealing with developers en masse, logic and simplicity don't win arguments.

[18:50:06] <samarjit> Hi, i have a suggestion for jqueryui theme framework .. "It would be nice to see the enumerations of colors as separate css classes, so that it can be used else where in a website"
