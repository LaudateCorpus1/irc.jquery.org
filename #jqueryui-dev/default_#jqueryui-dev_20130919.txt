[02:36:04] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[02:36:21] <uGoMobi> frequent: pong
[02:36:29] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[02:36:52] <frequent> uGoMobi: if I'm pre-enhancing elements, is it still necessary to set the corresponding data-attributes?
[02:37:24] <frequent> uGoMobi: would be nice to rid myself of a little data-
[02:37:25] <uGoMobi> frequent: in general yes
[02:37:26] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yes, if the pre-rendered markup reflects a non-default attribute value.
[02:37:47] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hey
[02:37:51] <frequent> :-( ok
[02:38:04] <_|Nix|_> frequent: For example: <div class="ui-btn"><input data-corners="false" type="button"></input></div>
[02:38:38] <frequent> ok
[02:38:42] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Basically, you don't have to-have to, but if you don't, and you call .button( "option", "corners", true ) later on, it might not work, because it thinks it already has corners.
[02:39:30] <frequent> _|Nix|_: yes, I guess if any modification of options is necessary, I have to provide
[02:39:41] <_|Nix|_> frequent: So, if the pre-rendered markup is such that it would result from an option having a non-default value, you must specify the data-* attribute whenever you want the option setting to work correctly.
[02:40:37] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok. Can't say whether things need be modified, so I will leave them on.
[02:40:48] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... I mean, some options will work no matter what. For example, if the _setOptions code for some option is .toggleClass( "ui-blah-blah", options.optionName ), then setting options will always work.
[02:41:44] <frequent> (looks up .ui-blah-blah in JQM css) ;-)
[02:42:05] <frequent> _|Nix|_: thx
[02:42:06] <_|Nix|_> frequent: But basically, if the initial state of the widget is inconsistent, i.e., the markup says the option value is x, but the option says its value is y, then you can never be 100% sure that changing the option value later will work. You have to test for each option.
[02:42:11] <_|Nix|_> frequent: NP!
[02:42:20] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Glad you're using this pre-rendered stuff!
[02:42:46] <_|Nix|_> frequent: It's supposed to be, like, ~30% faster, but I'm sure that's a different number for every widget.
[02:42:55] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I tried back in JQM 1.2
[02:43:19] <frequent> but hard to maintain all the hacks I made, so it's nice that it's available out of the box now
[02:43:26] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Of course, you're increasing wire weight with the extra DOM, so you gotta judge the merits for yourself.
[02:44:06] <_|Nix|_> frequent: OTOH, on packaged apps, pre-rendered should be all win, all the time.
[02:46:09] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I played around with returning Ajax responses (with my enhanced content), because my server was only sending junk... chunk-encoded. Once I gzipped the ajax response, it was only a few kb enhanced.
[02:46:36] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.6.x core build #414: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.6.x%20core/414/
[02:49:06] <frequent> _|Nix|_: but currently all content needs to be generated on the client, so I don't want to generate something and then have JQM do a second dom roundtrip for enhancement
[02:49:09] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I can't imagine that the difference in gzipped size between a non-pre-rendered and a pre-rendered average page is much more than a few bytes, so the execution time savings on the client side are almost certainly worth it.
[02:49:24] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Good plan!
[02:49:33] <frequent> _|Nix|_: let me try to shuffle something out during lunch
[02:49:41] <frequent> size difference
[02:49:50] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[02:49:52] <_|Nix|_> Thanks!

[04:32:17] <dreamreal> hi all - I have a JQm site that isn't applying styles, although the grid layout seems to be working okay
[04:32:58] <dreamreal> ajax calls work, so jquery is active, but I get no UI styling in terms of pretty buttons
[04:37:33] <_|Nix|_> dreamreal: Ummm ... CSS URL returning 404?
[04:37:42] <dreamreal> nope
[04:37:46] <_|Nix|_> dreamreal: Try asking in #jquery.
[04:37:51] <dreamreal> the columns are rendering properly, is the thing
[04:38:14] <dreamreal> ui-block-b, etc
[04:38:17] <dreamreal> thank you, i will

[04:57:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6485 - can I remove the unconfirmed tag?
[04:57:23] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6485 by applejacko (1d 17h ago): jQM Buttons Can Become Inoperable On Android Phones At Times
[04:58:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah sure, if you can reproduce it
[04:58:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have.
[04:59:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not on the second page yet, but the OP did say it's not 100% of the time.
[04:59:52] <uGoMobi> just read that
[05:00:57] <uGoMobi> will test it on some other Android devices / versions
[05:01:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. It's great that I have the exact device with the exact version of Android as mentioned in the issue :)
[05:02:24] <uGoMobi> yeah :)
[05:09:32] <AlexanderBB10> Bind.. Torture and Kill :)
[05:09:59] <_|Nix|_> WTF is it with these frivolous remarks ... is this spam?
[05:10:08] <AlexanderBB10> huh?
[05:10:32] <_|Nix|_> AlexanderBB10: I've been seing all kinds of weird chatter here in the past few days ...
[05:12:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: When the button fails to work, there's a vclick, followed by a short delay, followed by a second vclick and an immediate click.
[05:12:53] <AlexanderBB10> lol
[05:13:06] <AlexanderBB10> you see ghosts?
[05:14:52] <_|Nix|_> AlexanderBB10: I hope not.
[05:15:28] <_|Nix|_> ROTFL :) I love the guy's quit message :)
[05:15:40] <AlexanderBB10> wrong key combination
[05:15:41] <AlexanderBB10> :P
[05:15:41] <_|Nix|_> AlexanderBB10: I love your quit message :)
[05:15:51] <AlexanderBB10> whats my quit message?

[05:16:10] <AlexanderBB10> i didnt change my irc settings for last 5 years
[05:16:13] <AlexanderBB10> oh lol
[05:16:14] <AlexanderBB10> XD
[05:16:47] <AlexanderBB10> are you dutch?
[05:16:51] <AlexanderBB10> or used translate :P
[05:17:24] <_|Nix|_> AlexanderBB10: I speak English and German. Dutch is not so hard to understand after that.
[05:17:29] <AlexanderBB10> ahh :)
[05:19:33] <AlexanderBB10> im using this irc client now for like 7 years on 3 different platforms :)
[05:19:40] <AlexanderBB10> settings are universal :P
[05:21:06] <_|Nix|_> AlexanderBB10: I don't even know what mine says.
[05:21:24] <AlexanderBB10> hehe  :) how often do you change those settings, like never
[05:21:25] <_|Nix|_> Apparently, nothing.
[05:21:35] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[05:25:44] <AlexanderBB10> :)
[05:36:09] <_|Nix|_> Argh! I wish I had some handy-dandy code to console.log() an event.
[05:41:16] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_
[05:52:54] <frequent> arschmitz: hey
[05:55:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: morning. thanks for the widget style options doc
[05:56:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:58:15] <frequent> uGoMobi: your chorus text was supposed to be "Hey"...
[05:58:31] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:58:48] <uGoMobi> i knew i can't sing ;)
[06:01:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem a few that need to be filled in if they should be options or not but mostly done
[06:04:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we have to look into the "not easily set should stay"
[06:05:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont think there is anything wrong with that
[06:05:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: for consistency it would be better if theme is also set with a class in those cases
[06:05:20] <arschmitz> i think there are cases where style options make sense
[06:05:29] <uGoMobi> instead of data-theme
[06:06:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am thinking about flexibility to use it with other framework
[06:06:48] <uGoMobi> in cases like the loader we could still switch from theme option to option to set class that should be added
[06:07:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah long term i think that makes sense but thats not really an issue right now 
[06:08:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: some of this can be fixed if we add a classes option like ui is looking at
[06:08:25] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:08:43] <arschmitz> but i think thats not something for 1.4
[06:08:59] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping me when you have a minute.
[06:09:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and the way docs wise i think to handle this is we dont say all style options are deprecated
[06:09:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we deprecated each individual option
[06:10:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: column toggle would be fixed by a classes option also
[06:11:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, it wasn't clear to me that this doc was only meant for now 1.4
[06:12:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I agree we don't have to make all changes in one version
[06:12:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh sorry yeah and i agree for later versions we should attempt to fix those
[06:13:06] <uGoMobi> then we have the same idea :)
[06:13:13] <arschmitz> awesome
[06:13:27] <uGoMobi> all these should work without making changes, right?
[06:13:48] <uGoMobi> we just have to document/demonstrate which classes to use
[06:14:42] <uGoMobi> listview inset might need some attention
[06:14:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[06:15:12] <arschmitz> some we just need to document to use wrapperClass
[06:15:43] <arschmitz> the only tough ones might be slider rangeslider
[06:15:54] <uGoMobi> although, listview inset isn't a problem either... we add both ui-listview and ui-listview-inset
[06:16:23] <arschmitz> but i dont think we should put any effort into that we just should not deprecate those options there we should deprecate whole widget
[06:16:24] <uGoMobi> have to check if we do it the same way with collapsibles
[06:16:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: need to think about collapsible set a little
[06:17:07] <arschmitz> because its options reflect down to individual collapsibles
[06:17:20] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:17:37] <arschmitz> still perfectly possible to do with add / remove class
[06:17:45] <arschmitz> just a little more documentation needed
[06:18:08] <arschmitz> and i think we should remove the options reflect down anyway its super complicated for no good reason
[06:18:53] <arschmitz> what if you want them to be different?
[06:19:24] <uGoMobi> yeah, that's why we would need classes to negate
[06:19:36] <uGoMobi> like ui-fillsize, ui-noninset, etc
[06:19:49] <uGoMobi> ui-fullsize*
[06:20:04] <uGoMobi> too complicated
[06:20:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: unless im mistaken id have to double check but collapsible set just sets the classes on all its child collapsibles
[06:21:09] <uGoMobi> oh it's only group-theme that goes on the set then
[06:21:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:21:28] <uGoMobi> anyways... less complicated is better
[06:21:48] <uGoMobi> collapsible set should just take care of accordion effect
[06:22:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and i already have implementation of accordian from ui in mobile we need to look into 
[06:22:11] <arschmitz> after 1.4
[06:22:39] <arschmitz> it could replace both collapsible and sollapsible set
[06:23:17] <uGoMobi> reminds me that we have to go thru the ui-mobile-notes from Jorn before our november meeting
[06:23:28] <arschmitz> yes for sure
[06:23:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i implemented ui dialog already too
[06:23:44] <arschmitz> as replacement for popup
[06:24:10] <uGoMobi> nice
[06:24:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no JS at all
[06:24:21] <arschmitz> css only
[06:24:35] <uGoMobi> that's how I like it :-P
[06:24:57] <arschmitz> and no custom css just applying css we already have to it
[06:25:22] <uGoMobi> can it be used we UI's positioning?
[06:25:57] <arschmitz> its using ui positioning and seems to be working well
[06:26:41] <uGoMobi> great
[06:26:54] <uGoMobi> frequent: ping
[06:27:01] <arschmitz> its different then our positioning but its a different widget so that is obvious
[06:27:13] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey!  ... :-)
[06:27:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, we can look into that
[06:27:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe our popup positioning inspires UI's to make changes to positioning
[06:28:17] <frequent> I tried a page with header, footer and panel outside of the page. Same as...
[06:28:17] <frequent> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/panels/external.php
[06:28:17] <frequent> but toolbars outside too.
[06:28:17] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[06:28:25] <frequent> everything works, but the panel does not push away the header/footer, so it appears below
[06:28:36] <frequent> uGoMobi: any idea where to start looking?
[06:29:16] <uGoMobi> frequent: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/panels/page-a.html
[06:29:46] <uGoMobi> that examples has external header, internal footer, external panel left, internal panel right
[06:30:00] <uGoMobi> which combination are you using?
[06:30:06] <frequent> uGoMobi: all external
[06:30:17] <uGoMobi> what display mode for the panel?
[06:30:24] <frequent> uGoMobi: push
[06:30:28] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:30:56] <frequent> uGoMobi: I should get the header to work though if it works in the demo... will also have a look
[06:31:56] <uGoMobi> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/panels/page-c.html that page has external header and external push panel left
[06:32:24] <uGoMobi> frequent: you test on FF?
[06:33:00] <frequent> uGoMobi: yes
[06:33:41] <uGoMobi> frequent: when you inspect the code while the panel is open does the header get those classes: ui-panel-fixed-toolbar ui-panel-animate ui-panel-page-content-position-left ui-panel-page-content-display-push ui-panel-page-content-open
[06:34:42] <frequent> uGoMobi: 1sec
[06:35:08] <frequent> uGoMobi: nope.
[06:35:21] <frequent> uGoMobi: header has "ui-header  ui-header-fixed slidedown ui-bar-my-theme"
[06:36:12] <frequent> uGoMobi: both header/footer are pre-enhanced
[06:36:29] <uGoMobi> frequent: are you dynamically injecting the header or is it already there?
[06:37:00] <frequent> uGoMobi: injecting
[06:38:02] <arschmitz> frequent: there is the problem 
[06:38:12] <arschmitz> frequent: panel adds those other classes to the toolbars
[06:38:22] <uGoMobi> .ui-header:jqmData(position='fixed'
[06:38:48] <arschmitz> so if the header is not there when panel does this classes wont get added
[06:38:56] <uGoMobi> frequent: I guess you add the fixed class and not data-position="fixed"
[06:39:04] <frequent> arschmitz: ah, so the other way areound
[06:39:12] <frequent> uGoMobi: both at the moment
[06:39:16] <frequent> areound/around
[06:39:37] <uGoMobi> we add the classes just before opening the panel
[06:39:56] <uGoMobi> it looks for .ui-header:jqmData(position='fixed')
[06:40:00] <uGoMobi> same for footer
[06:40:58] <uGoMobi> do your toolbars have the data- attribute?
[06:41:31] <frequent> uGoMobi: yup data-role="header/footer"
[06:41:50] <uGoMobi> frequent: data-position
[06:41:55] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok
[06:42:04] <arschmitz> frequent: you need data-position="fixed" also
[06:42:20] <frequent> arschmitz: I set data-position-fixed="true"
[06:42:23] <frequent> ...
[06:42:31] <frequent> that should be it
[06:44:18] <frequent> uGoMobi: arschmitz: thx.
[06:45:03] <uGoMobi> frequent: does it work when you set data-position="fixed"?
[06:47:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I wonder why we use .ui-header:jqmData(position='fixed') instead of .ui-header-fixed in panel.js
[06:48:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: honestly no idea guessing that just how it was written no good reason
[06:48:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I think so too
[06:49:15] <arschmitz> only thing using data-attribute gives you is if enhancement order was an issue
[06:49:19] <arschmitz> but its not
[06:50:02] <uGoMobi> I will do a git blame and if I don't see a good reason I change it
[06:53:40] <frequent> uGoMobi: arschmitz: brb, need to go to a quick meeting
[07:16:31] <frequent> uGoMobi: arschmitz: works! Thx. http://bit.ly/16qjdvo
[07:16:53] <arschmitz> frequent: awesome
[07:17:42] <uGoMobi> frequent: great. I will probably make a change so it also works if you just use ui-header-fixed class and no data-position="fixed"
[07:18:16] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. cool

[12:12:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I clused https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6451
[12:12:51] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6451 by gabrielschulhof (1w 3d ago): Deprecate buttonMarkup
[12:13:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, we need to have some documentation about which class does what.
[12:13:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you already added to changelog wiki page?
[12:13:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sure did.
[12:13:19] <uGoMobi> awesome
[12:13:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and the API docs. ... and the code.
[12:13:33] <uGoMobi> even more awesome
[12:13:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just so you know im re-organizing some nav related stuff right now
[12:13:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[12:13:47] <arschmitz> not really changeing anything just cleaning up
[12:14:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes we have to document that
[12:14:05] <uGoMobi> and add demos
[12:14:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, good. I just finished the API page for pagecontainer, and it took me like a week, so please don't change the API :)
[12:14:24] <uGoMobi> I don't think we get that in before Monday
[12:14:37] <uGoMobi> but also don't want to wait longer with beta release
[12:14:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: get what in?
[12:14:53] <uGoMobi> maybe I tell people to keep an eye on demos on master
[12:14:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno where to put that. We should have a section for style.
[12:15:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "CSS Features"?
[12:15:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: demos of buttonMarkup classes
[12:15:16] <arschmitz> ohhh yeah
[12:15:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: brings up what we talked about yesterday about needing api for theme :)
[12:15:53] <uGoMobi> yup
[12:15:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... we already have a buttons demo pag.e
[12:16:09] <_|Nix|_> Has travis started using https?
[12:16:14] <uGoMobi> in my Google doc I suggested CSS framework category 
[12:16:30] <uGoMobi> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWN1UAncQHcmDfy9UuD_ftMtyhQhWiq3inYm0ReE-J8/edit
[12:16:31] <_|Nix|_> I'm getting an unknown certificate error ...
[12:16:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good idea
[12:16:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: can add things like ui-bar classes and stuff too
[12:17:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can get such a category up and running ...
[12:17:08] <uGoMobi> yes, exaclty
[12:17:09] <arschmitz> those can be useful page elements i have used them a lot
[12:17:20] <uGoMobi> I think I already listed those in my doc
[12:17:56] <uGoMobi> yeah, also want to add a demo to simply use ui-body if you want "cards style"
[12:17:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are slider and rangeslider already listed among the deprecations in the 1.4-changelog?
[12:18:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure need to double check that
[12:18:13] <uGoMobi> looks even better now page and ui-body are slightly different color
[12:18:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll check.
[12:18:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i use those classes all over the place and content too
[12:18:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Slider is there, but you forgot rangeslider. I'll ad it.
[12:18:49] <_|Nix|_> s/ad/add/
[12:18:49] <arschmitz> gives the whole page a nice consisnt look
[12:19:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont think nearly enough people re-use the theme classes ( part of what we talked about yesterday also )
[12:19:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: about the button demo page... I think we should split it up
[12:19:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Into widget and style?
[12:19:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: very true
[12:20:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[12:20:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[12:20:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so many good reasons for a seperate theme project
[12:20:29] <uGoMobi> yeah agreed
[12:20:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is that where topcoat comes in? New theme = topcoat + our own stuff?
[12:20:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe kinda
[12:21:08] <arschmitz> but we were talking more about a jquery specific one
[12:21:17] <arschmitz> but topcoat will play into that
[12:21:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we most probably have our own version
[12:21:24] <uGoMobi> right
[12:21:48] <arschmitz> top coat is all about namespaced interchangeable themes
[12:22:02] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I just figured with topcoat out there it would give us something on top of which we can build our own.
[12:22:02] <arschmitz> so we can build on the same concepts and make theme compatible
[12:22:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Does topcoat have swatches?
[12:22:33] <arschmitz> no
[12:22:55] <arschmitz> but they are still looking into things like tools and theme roller type stuff
[12:23:05] <_|Nix|_> Nice!
[12:23:07] <arschmitz> and ui does not have swatches either
[12:23:16] <uGoMobi> that's what makes it interesting for them as well to collaborate
[12:23:27] <uGoMobi> they have just light and dark theme
[12:23:56] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, the swatch + theme inheritance thing really brings out that CSS limitation where you can't alternate infinitely.
[12:23:57] <uGoMobi> and working on minimal theme
[12:24:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we had a couple conversations about this stuff in general but there is no real solid decisions or anything yet
[12:24:57] <arschmitz> just a desire to work together on what we see as a generally common goal
[12:24:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when we get to the point that people add classes themselves we don't need to do inheritance with CSS anymore
[12:25:02] <uGoMobi> no inheritance at all
[12:25:09] <uGoMobi> just add the class in your markup
[12:25:31] <uGoMobi> then we can use on class in the selector like topcoat does and that makes it much faster
[12:25:42] <uGoMobi> s/on/one/
[12:25:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nononono ... You add swatch a to your page, swatch b to your collapsibleset, and swatch a to your collapsible, and your collapsible looks like swatch b.
[12:26:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's inheritance. It doesn't matter that you added the class by hand or not.
[12:26:25] <uGoMobi> ah ok you mean the overrides
[12:26:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[12:26:54] <uGoMobi> but that's only in cases where you have a group theme and individual theme
[12:26:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You never have such problems until you introduce swatches + theme inheritance.
[12:26:59] <uGoMobi> and we should drop that
[12:27:16] <uGoMobi> just add theme class to each collapsible and nothing to the set
[12:27:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's true
[12:28:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we changed that because adding classes to all elements with JS is bad performance
[12:28:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we can go back if the dev adds the class in his markup and not our JS
[12:28:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I know, definitely, but, like I said - it doesn't matter how you add your classes - whether with JS or by hand - you won't be able to override a swatch more than once.
[12:29:14] <uGoMobi> not if things are nested, right
[12:29:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly.
[12:29:47] <_|Nix|_> But anyway, I'm totally hung up on that, because it's a total CSS limitation.
[12:30:15] <_|Nix|_> Two flips of the swatch ought to be enough for everybody.
[12:30:24] <_|Nix|_> ™
[12:30:37] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:31:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that double scrollbar issue in the docs can only be reproduced if you build local?
[12:32:16] <uGoMobi> there is no stage of the 1-4 branch, right?
[12:32:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes. You must view the version of the API docs from the 1-4 branch.
[12:32:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not AFAIK.
[12:32:36] <uGoMobi> ah ok

[12:41:13] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: how do we view the 1-4 branch ?
[12:41:24] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Well, you need to do a local deploy.
[12:41:56] <agcolom> I have a local deploy of "master", does that mean I get a local deploy of the 1.4 branch too?
[12:41:56] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: If you have wordpress set up locally, you do a grunt wordpress-deploy and then open local.api.jquerymobile.com/checkboxradio in your browser.
[12:42:39] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Just change branches to 1-4 and do a grunt wordpress-deploy
[12:42:50] <agcolom> oh, ok.
[12:42:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That will overwrite all the stuff you deployed from master.
[12:43:30] <agcolom> to change branch, do I go git checkout name_of_the_branch?
[12:44:00] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! Did travis get compromised?
[12:44:05] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yep.
[12:44:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Easy-peasy!
[12:44:30] <_|Nix|_> "The certificate is only valid for the following names: www.genomelog.in , genomelog.in  
[12:44:33] <_|Nix|_> "
[12:44:34] <_|Nix|_> O_o
[12:44:45] <_|Nix|_> That's the FF certificate warning ...
[12:44:50] <agcolom> Travis is doing weird stuff!
[12:45:14] <agcolom> yesterday, build 806 and 807 were broken. 
[12:45:30] <agcolom> Then this morning, while nothing was touched, they were fixed!
[12:46:16] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Not unusual. Our builds are sensitive to machine load.
[12:46:33] <agcolom> oh, I see! 
[12:48:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Are you renaming ui-corner-all?
[12:48:26] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: I'm on the page and 1-4 branch
[12:48:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If so, I'm going to document it under its new name.
[12:48:42] <agcolom> For which example are you seeing the double scrollbar?
[12:48:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The very first one.
[12:48:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nah, UI is using ui-corner-all
[12:48:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Cool. Can do.
[12:49:17] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: *sigh* ... lemme guess: no problems for you.
[12:49:57] <agcolom> no problem for  me ....
[12:50:14] <agcolom> sorry :-(
[12:51:01] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... I don't get it. Well, if nobody else has this problem - fine by me. If a lot of others have it, we'll know about it, and we can make multiple releases of the docs, anyway.
[12:51:27] <agcolom> uGoMobi: do you have a local setup for the api docs?
[12:51:41] <agcolom> (just to see if someone else can see this?)
[12:52:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, that'd be nice, since you also have Linux.
[12:52:36] <_|Nix|_> It'd be freaky if it'd be, like, a C library floating point rounding issue.
[12:52:50] <_|Nix|_> ... or something like that.
[12:53:14] <_|Nix|_> ... because that would be totally Linux-specific.
[13:26:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: Ping!
[13:30:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pong
[13:30:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i realized while going through nav stuff we need to deprecate $.mobile.activePage
[13:30:54] <arschmitz> and have a way to get / set activePage in container widget
[13:31:26] <arschmitz> because with multiple page containers you can have multiple active pages
[13:31:49] <uGoMobi> hmm
[13:33:06] <uGoMobi> right
[13:35:03] <uGoMobi> how are we going to deal with that with multiple containers
[13:35:39] <arschmitz> its not hard activepage will be part of pagecontainer
[13:35:55] <arschmitz> each pagecontainer will have a active page property
[13:36:16] <arschmitz> and method to retrieve it
[13:36:44] <arschmitz> so it will kinda be like widget method works where it returns the element
[13:37:07] <arschmitz> there will be an activepage method that will return the active page element
[13:43:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and in widgets like panel where we need the active page we just look for the closest element with active page class?
[13:45:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: or just do .closest("data( pagecontainer )").pagecontainer("activepage")
