[11:00:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[11:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:01:15] <scott_gonzalez> on a call though
[11:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> what's up?
[11:01:29] <kborchers> ok, just let me know when available to chat real quick
[11:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:02:36] <kborchers> just wondering based on today's meeting if i should issue a pull req for the autoExpand on Menubar or wait for a fix/rebuild of hoverIntent
[12:12:35] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ^^^ just sent pull request and we can update with hoverIntent once a decision is made on what to do with that plugin
[12:58:24] <scott_gonzalez> oh, yeah, feel free to use hoverintent
[12:59:02] <scott_gonzalez> wait, are we talking about inside the menu or just in a demo?
[13:01:20] <kborchers> i thought we were talking about in menu but i could just add to demo for now
[13:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'd be hesitant to use hoverintent inside a plugin unless we adopted it
[13:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> we don't have dependencies on plugins not supported by the jQuery team
[13:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> but we can use other plugins in demos
[13:03:37] <kborchers> that's why i was a little confused
[13:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> who suggested that? Richard?
[13:04:47] <kborchers> jzaefferer asked me to add autoExpand to menubar then Richard brought up hoverIntent when looking at the demo today
[13:05:11] <scott_gonzalez> hmm.... Richard's offline right now
[13:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> let's ask him to clarify when he's around
[13:05:50] <jzaefferer> let's just add the autoExpand option, without hoverintent
[13:06:03] <kborchers> richard later said he played with the demo some more and he liked it so not sure where he stood on it
[13:06:26] <kborchers> i have sent the pull req without hoverintent
[13:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> heh, ok
