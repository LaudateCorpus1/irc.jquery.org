[00:03:04] <agcolom>  scott_gonzalez: gnarf: hi! not sure who's in charge for this, but I just noticed that from http://stage.jquery.com/, clicking on the "all projects" (in the top left corner) doesn't have the same effect as doing it from ui or mobile. (and I love that pink color!!!!)

[07:27:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i will be late if i make it to the meeting today. i haven't had much time to work this week so nothing to report. waiting on work from design guys to dive into jqueryui.com. willing to jump in where help is still needed outside of jqueryui.com so just let me know where.
[08:10:29] <jzaefferer> kborchers: isn't there enough content work to be done anyway?
[08:11:29] <kborchers> maybe? it's hard to know what has/hasn't been done without looking through each document
[08:11:53] <jzaefferer> okay :/
[08:12:19] <jzaefferer> I hate the "I have to wait for a designer" thing, this has been plaguing the project for way too long
[08:13:07] <jzaefferer> kborchers: here's more design free work, if you're bored: https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/issues/16
[08:15:02] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, in a meeting now but will take a look at that
[08:15:40] <jzaefferer> thanks

[09:42:04] <bot-t> (50 hours 10 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell gnarf I updated the licensing for Color. We should be ready for release. I think version.txt can be deleted.

[12:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: Is this English? "By responsive I meant was the menus change behavior on certain width. Could be a complete list which is visible in a 320 px/Mobile  or could be a click added to the menu  where it can be functional on click at a smaller width/mobile width."
[14:17:28] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: are you still around?
