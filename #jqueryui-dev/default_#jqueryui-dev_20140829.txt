[05:29:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping! https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7636 is apparently caused by the Math.round() in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/39cb20fe26969941329347e2f41a222f94c63138/js/widgets/forms/slider.js#L438
[05:30:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: If the pixels-per-step is less than 1, we increment the percentage by at least one percent.
[05:30:23] <gabriel_schulhof> So, our slider can have at most 100 steps.
[05:30:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Is that intentional?
[05:30:44] <arschmitz> ok
[05:30:51] <arschmitz> yes i think it was if i recall
[05:31:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Alright, well, I guess this is a wontfix then.
[05:31:42] <gabriel_schulhof> I can do a blame and see why we added it.
[05:32:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i do also remember writing logic to calculate single pixel steps for a slider
[05:32:16] <arschmitz> but it might have been a different one not ours iv written / worked on a few
[05:32:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Right
[05:32:40] <arschmitz> i do agree thats how it should be
[05:32:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I can tell the OP to remove the Math.round() and then he'll get his continuous slider.
[05:33:10] <arschmitz> but since we plan to re-write soon id leave open but not invest too much time unless others complain
[05:33:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[05:33:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: also you MUST have set increments for range slider
[05:33:44] <arschmitz> it cant be continuous 
[05:33:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Why not?
[05:34:08] <gabriel_schulhof> The range cannot go to 0?
[05:35:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Either way, in the re-write we should at least expose this limitation so people can write extensions to remove it.
[05:35:49] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its because of handle alignment
[05:36:32] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and yes it will be addressed in re-write i don't think its an issue already with the ui one. 
[05:39:15] <gabriel_schulhof> What should I milestone https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7636 as?
[05:39:17] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof unassigned issue #7636: Range slider does not move in specified step using mouse drag when max value is big 02http://git.io/Vfh-wg
[05:39:52] <gabriel_schulhof> 1.6 I guess - that's the rewrite.
[05:40:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: maybe probably
[05:40:15] <arschmitz> things are always changing...
[05:40:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I'm just looking at the roadmap.
[05:40:33] <arschmitz> yeah i know
[05:41:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I gave the OP all the necessary tools to address this (rather unusual) use case.
[05:54:22] <gabriel_schulhof> *sigh* ... looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7623 I'm starting to think that maybe the page container should be a div inside the body surrounded by outside-the-page widgets.
[05:54:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Otherwise, we'll, like, never get the transitions right.
[05:56:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the footer is intentional its a known limitation
[05:56:20] <arschmitz> and its documented i believe
[05:56:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Right ...
[05:56:45] <arschmitz> and the 2 headers is their own fault
[05:56:51] <arschmitz> they have 2 headers lol
[05:57:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Nono. The header on both pages is outside the page.
[05:57:59] <arschmitz> exactly its on both pages
[05:58:48] <gabriel_schulhof> It's exactly how we're telling people to write their markup. Copy outside-the-page elements to each document, because you never know which one'll end up the start document.
[05:59:02] <arschmitz> they have to manage them themselves in this case
[05:59:10] <arschmitz> to do proper persistent headers you need to use the server to only on full load not ajax
[05:59:16] <arschmitz> its that way in the demo
[06:00:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Nono. That's for optimization only. If you Ajax in a full document, everything except the first page gets discarded.
[06:00:16] <arschmitz> fixed headers hide the problem sometimes though because they just sit on top of each other
[06:00:31] <arschmitz> hmm right so where is the second one coming from then?
[06:01:05] <gabriel_schulhof> That's the footer temporarily jumping to the top because there's no page in between to keep header and footer apart.
[06:01:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Pages are absolute during transition so they take up no vertical space.
[06:01:44] <arschmitz> oh right so there is no issue here he warn about this
[06:02:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess I can point them to the docs.
[06:02:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you can also define your own pagecontainer
[06:02:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Though the header shouldn't be fading out.
[06:03:00] <gabriel_schulhof> That's an interesting thing I noticed. The header fades out, but only if you're Ajax-ing in a page.
[06:03:15] <gabriel_schulhof> If you link to an internal page, the header persists.
[06:03:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hmm not sure what that is
[06:03:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/7623/page1.html
[06:04:01] <gabriel_schulhof> I've added a link to an internal page for comparison.
[06:04:10] <gabriel_schulhof> I've been meaning to look into that, but never had the time.
[06:04:31] <gabriel_schulhof> There should be no difference between transitioning to an Ajax-ed-in page and transitioning to an internal page.
[06:04:37] <arschmitz> nope 
[06:04:43] <arschmitz> and i have no idea why in this case there is
[06:05:02] <gabriel_schulhof> I can look at that.
[06:05:32] <gabriel_schulhof> First guess: It's the way we insert the Ajax-ed-in page into the DOM.
[06:05:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Maybe it's absolute even before the transition or something.
[06:07:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ohhh yeah totally i bet the page is covering it
[06:07:30] <arschmitz> the toolbar is not fading the page is fading on top of it
[06:07:46] <arschmitz> and some timeing is different for the ajax case because its async i bet
[06:07:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, exactly, and at the end of the transition it snaps to below the toolbar because we remove position: absolute
[06:08:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[06:08:29] <gabriel_schulhof> But why is this not happening we a built-in page. We add position: absolute to that one too.
[06:08:48] <gabriel_schulhof> s/we/with/
[06:09:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: internal is 100% sync
[06:09:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: external is async
[06:10:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but internal and external start from the same state: The page is in the DOM.
[06:10:56] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean the transitions.
[06:11:27] <gabriel_schulhof> So, the Ajax retrieval has completed and the page has been added to the DOM when the transition starts.
[06:11:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but the position is managed by toolbars isnt it?
[06:11:59] <arschmitz> because its based on if its fixed and external or not
[06:12:33] <gabriel_schulhof> If toolbars do anything to pages to make them cooperate then they must do so to newly arriving Ajax-ed-in pages as well!
[06:12:46] <gabriel_schulhof> The toolbars in this example are not fixed.
[06:13:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/toolbar.js#L84
[06:13:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, no!
[06:13:47] <gabriel_schulhof> So, the incoming page is not captured by that selector.
[06:14:03] <gabriel_schulhof> This is hackish!
[06:14:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[06:14:35] <arschmitz> but its the only way to make external AND internal AND transitions AND fixed play at all nice together currently
[06:14:51] <arschmitz> we have talked about wanting to revisit all this when we revisit transitions
[06:15:19] <arschmitz> oh shoot
[06:15:24] <gabriel_schulhof> We should this._on( this.document, { pagecreate: function( event ) { $( event.target ).css( "position", "relative" ); } );
[06:15:30] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: check out that comment and tell me where it actually does that lol
[06:15:52] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: since this is in toolbar not fixed toolbar
[06:16:28] <gabriel_schulhof> I don't get it. _setRelative() runs on refresh()
[06:16:52] <arschmitz> refresh runs on pageshow
[06:17:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Too late.
[06:17:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Why so late?
[06:18:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: needs to be after transition completes
[06:18:09] <gabriel_schulhof> It should be pagebeforeshow at least, and, of course, it should actually be pagecontainerbeforetransition.
[06:19:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, yes, but it also needs to run before the transition begins, because currently this runs for the pageshow of the first page, so if it's a multipage document it'll also tag the second page.
[06:19:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its suposed to only be on the new page
[06:19:44] <arschmitz> i think
[06:20:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, it grabs everything inside the document.
[06:20:07] <arschmitz> i know
[06:20:18] <arschmitz> thats seems incorrect
[06:20:50] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and yet transitions between multiple internal pages look better than transitions between an existing page and an Ajax-ed-in page.
[06:20:58] <arschmitz> we need to rethink transitions completely for multipage containers anyway
[06:21:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ...
[06:21:25] <gabriel_schulhof> We're bleeding from so many wounds :)
[06:21:39] <arschmitz> which is the point i want to think about js vs css transitions more
[06:21:54] <arschmitz> it gives us much more control
[06:23:15] <gabriel_schulhof> This fixes it for the page1.html/page2.html example above: 		$( document ).on( "pagecreate", function( event ) { $( event.target ).css( "position", "relative" ); });
[06:23:50] <arschmitz> that seems like a better approach anyway
[06:25:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: make sure you test slide transition
[06:25:38] <arschmitz> pretty sure thats where all the dragons be hiding 
[06:25:38] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[06:25:43] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[06:26:00] <arschmitz> both pages visible at same time...
[06:26:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[06:27:04] <gabriel_schulhof> slide is broken for internal pages precisely because they are also tagged.
[06:27:55] <gabriel_schulhof> The thing is, relative would be fine if we were to move the pages before transitioning them.
[06:28:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Like to.offset( from.offset() );
[06:28:20] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:28:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Or, the appropriate thing for slide.
[06:29:01] <gabriel_schulhof> I don't understand why we don't move them.
[06:29:10] <arschmitz> yeah i think our transitions could be better
[06:29:37] <gabriel_schulhof> In fact, I think we could always use to.offset( from.offset() ) because the transition could also transform to -100% for slide.
[06:29:55] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean it could translate to 100% or -100% or whatever.
[06:30:08] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:30:56] <gabriel_schulhof> A major review, no doubt.
[06:31:13] <gabriel_schulhof> The transitions we have were never meant to deal with portions of the viewport, I don't think.
[06:31:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: nope
[06:32:08] <gabriel_schulhof> You know, a pagecontainer that is a real div on its own could be made to clip its contents so it can behave like a mini viewport. Like, with css clip.
[06:32:22] <arschmitz> yup
[06:32:32] <arschmitz> and just overflow hidden
[06:32:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[06:32:49] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and then you could slide and move pages with impunity.
[06:33:02] <arschmitz> yup
[06:33:11] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and surround them with arbitrary out-of-page widgets.
[06:33:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Utopia
[06:33:33] <arschmitz> more or less the eventual goal
[06:34:04] <gabriel_schulhof> That's a much more philosophical statement given my previous statement :)
[06:34:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Bet be careful lest the PTB smite us or something :)
[06:34:38] <gabriel_schulhof> s/Bet/Best/
[07:07:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Ping!
[07:18:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What's up?
[07:18:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: http://jsbin.com/yuyeti/3
[07:18:28] <arschmitz> click the link in top left then click back button
[07:19:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes. Done.
[07:19:34] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Blank.
[07:19:34] <arschmitz> the first one is jsbin the second is the real site
[07:19:39] <arschmitz> blank?
[07:19:45] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[07:19:50] <arschmitz> did you go to edit view?
[07:20:05] <gabriel_schulhof> View.
[07:20:09] <arschmitz> edit view is currently broken with backbutton and goes blank
[07:20:29] <arschmitz> but full page should not what browser are you using?
[07:21:09] <arschmitz> oh weird something is odd in firefox
[07:21:15] <arschmitz> if thats what you are using
[07:21:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[07:21:50] <gabriel_schulhof> I was using FF. In Chrome it works as expected.
[07:22:18] <arschmitz> weird it just started working in firefox for me
[07:22:25] <arschmitz> and i didnt do anything to change it lol
[07:22:37] <arschmitz> but anyway non ajax transitions
[07:22:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that would work for everything execpt slide
[07:24:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Why not slide?
[07:25:11] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and you must mean non-CSS transitions, right?
[07:25:26] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: this works in firefox
[07:25:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: becuase slide you need both in the dom at once
[07:25:40] <arschmitz> which requires ajax
[07:25:50] <arschmitz> everyother transition we fade to white
[07:26:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and it would work with css too
[07:26:14] <arschmitz> i just did it with js because i wanted to
[07:26:29] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, I see what you mean.
[07:26:56] <arschmitz> firefox does not fire dom ready on backbutton
[07:27:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I mean with http requests there's no way you can have both the to and the from in the DOM at the same time.
[07:27:02] <arschmitz> had to use pageshow
[07:27:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, presumably because it saves the DOM in an already-ready state.
[07:27:53] <arschmitz> yeah chrome still fires it though
[07:28:12] <gabriel_schulhof> We all know Chrome is quite trigger-happy with events at startup.
[07:29:21] <arschmitz> either way pageshow works
[07:29:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[07:29:43] <gabriel_schulhof> I wonder how many people use our transitions on their own.
[07:29:52] <arschmitz> probably none
[07:30:03] <arschmitz> iv never seen or heard of it
[07:30:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, so I wonder if we need to go through a deprecation period.
[07:31:27] <gabriel_schulhof> I googled site:api.jquerymobile.com transition and we mention transitions in a bunch of places, but we don't document them as such.
[07:33:24] <gabriel_schulhof> On the demos, we show various transitions, and we even explain how to make custom ones, but we never show how to use them with arbitrary content.
[07:34:12] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I think if we re-implemented them behind the scenes, there wouldn't be much feather-rufflage.
[07:34:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyhoo ... I gotta go ... BBIAB

[21:21:32] <ganchenkor> Hi guys, do you know how to setup default page container in jqm 1.4.3 (by default it's body, I want something different)
