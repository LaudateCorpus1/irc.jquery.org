[00:34:27] <jiabao> Hello, I was wondering if the password reset on "bugs.jqueryui.com" is working, I forgot my password and dont seem to get any emails when I try to reset
[01:47:12] <tofra> I have a problem with jQuery Mobile 1.3.2 in combination with Chrome 43.x
[01:47:38] <tofra> When I open a popup, the popup opens.. but when I close it, I cannot scroll anymore in the main page..
[01:47:52] <tofra> This works fine in Chrome 42.x, but not in 43.
[01:50:00] <tofra> Does anyone uses jquery mobile 1.3.2 in combination with Chrome 43.x and using popups?
[01:57:12] <M4rius> Hi tofra, I am merely a user and not associated with jQuery, but have you tried making a simplified example of your problem using jsbin or jsfiddle? Would likely help :)
[02:03:25] <tofra> Trying to create it now..

[11:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Any idea what might cause this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1536#issuecomment-94634387
[11:33:25] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: hmm thats odd
[11:33:42] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:33:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's consisten too.
[11:34:52] <arschmitz> oh i think i know 
[11:34:54] <arschmitz> just a sec
[11:42:06] <arschmitz> hmm so i cant even get it to fail on phantom local
[11:42:27] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> That would at least make sense.
[11:43:01] <arschmitz> iv seen a lot of timeouts on travis lately but its not timing out
[11:43:08] <arschmitz> and the show and hide are not async or anything
[11:43:38] <arschmitz> wait a sec
[11:43:52] <arschmitz> why is domEqual not giving any diff?
[11:44:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[11:44:34] <scott_gonzalez> I assumed it was something to do with the grunt-contrib-qunit interface
[11:44:47] <arschmitz> no i always get huge useless diffs
[11:44:51] <arschmitz> in phantom
[11:44:54] <arschmitz> :-)
[11:45:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so it should be outputting a diff there 
[11:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[11:45:51] <arschmitz> just for laughs let me break something and double check that though
[11:48:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yup
[11:48:56] <arschmitz> massive diff
[11:49:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: null makes it sound like there is no diff so it should pass
[11:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it doesn't make sense.
[11:50:33] <scott_gonzalez> I've rescheduled that build just for kicks.
[11:50:42] <arschmitz> yeah i saw
[11:51:02] <arschmitz> see what happens
[11:51:33] <arschmitz> i removed an attribute from the removeAttr in destroy and out sprang mega diff so something is weird there
[13:59:44] <scott_gonzalez> Man, that Travis run STILL hasn't started.
