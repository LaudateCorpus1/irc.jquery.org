[07:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I can't take it anymore. I'm going to email Microsoft and find out what the deal is with the double focus events.
[07:33:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ouch, this was the status of TestSwarm when I presented at Strange Loop last year: http://cl.ly/1d331P2V0W0H2a0F0E0L
[07:37:26] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: did you figure out the ie leak issue?
[07:37:32] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[07:37:37] <DaveMethvin> whereza code?
[07:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4188
[07:38:05] <DaveMethvin> wow, oldie but goodie
[07:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> I've had occassions where I could see a leak and occassions where I couldn't.
[07:38:33] <DaveMethvin> i've had that experience too
[07:38:36] <DaveMethvin> only ie6?
[07:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> But even at times when I couldn't, there were people saying they could.
[07:38:41] <DaveMethvin> or ie7/8 as well?
[07:39:05] <scott_gonzalez> I believe ie7 as well, but no ie8.
[07:39:16] <DaveMethvin> i've tried to repro some of these in jsfiddle before and it never seems to be reliable
[07:39:26] <DaveMethvin> so i had to do on a standalone page
[07:39:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I've always tested in a standalone page in sieve.
[07:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> There's also this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/513
[07:40:22] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by Y-Kamata (6m, 1w ago): memory leak ui.widget
[07:40:52] <DaveMethvin> i remember that one, oddly
[07:41:21] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> The fix is definitely not valid.
[07:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> But it doesn't help that I couldn't reproduce the leak.
[07:49:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: YES!
[08:00:44] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: The difference between _createLeakEvent and _createNoLeakEvent was that the latter is a custom event, should have been fixed here http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7054 unless it is some other occurrence in core or UI
[08:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the ticket comments say that the leak continued to occur after that was fixed.
[08:01:58] <DaveMethvin> these are SOOO hard to find
[08:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> Can you at least verify that a leak exists?
[08:15:42] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: DaveMethvin Investigating the IE6 snap crashes ?
[08:16:01] <Krinkle> attributes test suite
[08:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> nope, trying to close a bug that's been open for years.
[08:16:06] <Krinkle> oh
[08:16:28] <DaveMethvin> i got 99 problems ... um, make that 100 problems now :P
[08:16:35] <Krinkle> I was going to say.. guys, take a different perspective, this is an awesome feature , quite effective to the browser usage :P
[08:17:23] <Krinkle> at some point that IE6 crash was gone but it is back now. browserstack IE6 crashes consistently on the attributes test
[08:17:35] <DaveMethvin> :(
[08:18:01] <Krinkle> just totally gone, leaving only the desktop
[08:21:30] <DaveMethvin> it's gonna be one of those days, i just updated virtualbox and now my vms are hosed
[08:57:09] <scott_gonzalez> We really need a better way to test. Using .simulate() isn't cutting it.
[09:01:01] <kborchers> i vote for trained monkeys on computers

[11:05:49] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: can you unmute jqm meeting
[11:06:11] <kborchers> for some reason todd can't do it right now
[11:06:24] <scott_gonzalez> done
[11:06:30] <scott_gonzalez> He needs to make himself an op first.
[11:06:36] <kborchers> thanks
[12:45:00] <toddparker> scott_gonzalez: it was od, it wouldn't let me op for some reason
[12:45:08] <toddparker> maybe i've signed in on too many devices or something

[15:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> That took 7 hours to fix :-(
[15:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> I really hate the async focus in IE. HATE!
[15:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's worse than anything else from IE6.
[15:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> And it's in all IEs :-(

[16:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: How much backlash do you think we'd get if we removed animations from tabs?
[16:52:44] <ajpiano> hard to say
[16:52:56] <ajpiano> i think if there was an extension that could patch it through people would be ok
[16:53:24] <ajpiano> but i think enogh people use it that how to emulate it will have to be documented and relatively simple
[16:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> Why do people use it?
[16:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> It's pretty ghetto.
[16:55:27] <scott_gonzalez> Are there any examples of desktop tabs being animated?
[16:56:11] <ajpiano> give people an effect, and someone will choose to bling it up i guess
[16:56:28] <scott_gonzalez> height: "toggle" is the only sane animation. opacity: "toggle" is pretty bad.
[16:56:42] <ajpiano> if you force the container height it isn't so bad
[16:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, if height is forced, then fading is ok
[16:58:55] <scott_gonzalez> Fade with fixed height is better than height toggle.
[16:59:07] <ajpiano> yep
[16:59:10] <ajpiano> that's what i've used
[16:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> Height toggle isn't very nice.
[16:59:34] <ajpiano> it's completely disruptive
[16:59:39] <ajpiano> it breaks the idea of "tabs"
[17:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? Tooltip is the only thing using the new _show/_hide methods :-(
[17:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: What if we use the new show/hide API?
[17:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's fucking gross, but it gives us fade :-)
[17:08:45] <scott_gonzalez> Gross in the sense that you shouldn't use effects on tabs...
[17:08:59] <ajpiano> what would it look like to a user?
[17:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> I can't tell you how nice this looks: $( "#tabs" ).tabs({ show: "slide", hide: "explode" })
[17:09:20] <scott_gonzalez> For fade: $( "#tabs" ).tabs({ show: true, hide: true })
[17:09:21] <ajpiano> lol hide explode
[17:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> or a number for duration
[17:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> true and number = fadeIn/fadeOut
[17:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> string = effect name (requires loading effects.core and respective effect)
[17:10:47] <ajpiano> that seems reasonable
[17:10:51] <scott_gonzalez> You can also do complex stuff like { effect: "explode", duration: 2000, easing: "easeOutBounce" }
[17:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...slide effect is nice :-)
[17:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> Blind gives you the equivalent of height: "toggle"
[17:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> So we've got all existing animations covered :-)
[17:13:18] <ajpiano> there we go!
[17:13:33] <scott_gonzalez> And a lot less code, since it's all in the widget factory.

[18:05:55] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (9.088s ago): Tabs: Implement new show/hide animation API.
[18:06:56] <ajpiano> wow, 3772
[18:10:23] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, I've been trying to get this done for years :-)
[18:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> We figured out the show/hide animation in Vienna.
[18:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> So that was a little over a year ago I guess.
[18:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> Then it took me forever to implement it.
[18:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> Then it took forever for a widget to use it (tooltip).
[18:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> I iterated on this inside dialog for a while.
[18:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> So dialog is close to having this API, but it won't get updated until 1.10.
[18:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> oh man, I totally forgot about this: show: object (core method) // .coreMethod( o.duration, o.easing )
[22:11:11] <gelegrodan> Can someone with access edit this page http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40995891/Docs2xml and remove the "Script a conversion of the source (raw MediaWiki or rendered html) to xml of all the existing documentation" ? since the script exists
