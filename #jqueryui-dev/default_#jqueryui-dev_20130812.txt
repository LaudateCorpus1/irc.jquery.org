[00:32:48] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6329 by jeffkevin (20h 29m ago): feature request: filter reveal in a popup list
[00:34:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think he wants us to provide a widget like the global search in the demos.
[00:35:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Basically, a custom select but not with a popup, but rather the list showing below the filter.
[00:35:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, filter + listview.
[00:35:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... based on a select.
[00:37:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think with the custom select it would make more sense to add the filter to the listview rather than the select itself.
[00:39:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think a demo might be in order.
[00:40:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... although it's not that easy, because the listview moves back and forth between a dialog and a popup.
[00:41:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, thanks
[00:41:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, this is demo stuff
[00:41:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The filter input might have to be placed inside a list item, and the filter callback might have to be modified to never filter the input :)
[00:41:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: after we updated the custom JS/CSS we add a demo how we did it
[00:43:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, <ul data-filter="true" data-input="#theSearch"><li><input data-type="search" id="theSearch"></input></li>...</ul>
[00:44:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and it would have to be recreated whenever the listview is recreated.
[00:48:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Uh-oh! The select button shouldn't have an id of "undefined-button"
[00:49:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that doesn't sound good indeed
[00:49:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We need to use this.uuid ...
[00:51:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ooooh, I see now what you meant ... it copies the classes from the option, so it copies the ui-screen-hidden class as well ...
[00:51:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I thought we did
[00:51:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[00:51:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nope. Not in select.
[00:51:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I say we should get rid of that anyway
[00:51:48] <uGoMobi> don't see the use of it
[00:51:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What ... giving IDs to the button and stuff?
[00:53:08] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... this copying-the-classes is a problem ...
[00:53:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: using uuid
[00:54:23] <uGoMobi> must be another widget then
[00:55:23] <_|Nix|_> I can see why we copy the classes, but it sure doesn't jive well with filterable.
[00:55:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why do we do it?
[00:56:09] <uGoMobi> why does the span needs same classes as the select and the selected option?
[00:56:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if the option is green in the list, it is green in the button.
[00:56:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's a nice effect. It's as if you cut out a piece of the list and stuck it inside a button.
[00:57:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Styles 'n' all.
[00:57:27] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[00:57:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Making an exception for the ui-screen-hidden class is an option but it seems hacky ...
[00:58:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can override the display none for ui-screen-hidden
[00:58:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, I could always add .removeClass( "ui-screen-hidden" ) to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/select.js#L249
[00:59:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I was thinking about that too ... 
[01:00:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's what I did in that JS Bin
[01:00:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK.
[01:00:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, *shrug* ... I guess we can pull that into the lib ...
[01:01:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, theoretically, this infringes on the absolute power of ui-screen-hidden.
[01:01:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I don't think any of the solutions would make me completely happy
[01:02:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Either way, it's a widget-specific rule.

[04:03:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll add it.
[04:03:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is actually a feature request to make it work like that
[04:03:07] <Dragooon> Yeah, i'd just pad the text box a bit
[04:03:19] <Dragooon> Looks kinda odd with the double rounded edges
[04:03:30] <_|Nix|_> Dragooon: Yeah ... my sense of aesthetics is === 0;
[04:03:58] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: yes we would need to add some CSS for this
[04:04:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how does it perform on a mobile device?
[04:04:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No clue.
[04:04:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: custom selects were already  a bit slow
[04:04:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lemme see ... 
[04:04:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ...
[04:05:03] <Dragooon> uGoMobi: Yeah, although they look pretty cool
[04:05:50] <Dragooon> _|Nix|_: So's mine, I just know some basics about designing and stuff. But I'm more of a backend guy
[04:06:01] <Dragooon> btw, great job on 1.4. It feels a lot more polished and snappy than 1.3

[04:06:09] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: thanks!
[04:06:17] <_|Nix|_> Dragooon: Thanks!
[04:06:26] <uGoMobi>  _|Nix|_: something else... I want to revert adding option inset for textinputs
[04:06:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[04:07:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Won't work nicely with filterable.
[04:07:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe I should have thought about it a bit more when we discussed adding it, sorry
[04:07:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and we have the issue with inset also setting option corners
[04:07:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[04:07:47] <uGoMobi> so I just want to try to fix everything with CSS
[04:08:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think the fundamental problem is that we're synching options between the input and the filterable.
[04:08:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That should go away after 1.5.0.
[04:08:25] <uGoMobi> we want to remove style options anyway
[04:08:26] <_|Nix|_> I mean after 1.4.0.
[04:08:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: agreed
[04:08:39] <uGoMobi> that should all work with CSS
[04:08:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. I would suggest publishing the option but making it deprecated right from the start.
[04:09:17] <uGoMobi> so that's another reason why I don't feel like adding another style option while planning on removal
[04:09:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... meaning that it will only be available in 1.4.0.
[04:09:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... as a transitional solution for backwards compatible filterables.
[04:10:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think that could also be done with CSS
[04:10:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because when you use the old way of having a listview filter it is wrapped in a form with a class
[04:11:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you can add this custom select filter I can look into all this filter input styling at once
[04:11:56] <uGoMobi> when you are done
[04:12:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ticket for custom select filter https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6282
[04:12:31] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6282 by X-O (1w 1d ago): Filter in custom select pop-up
[04:12:56] <uGoMobi> we also have to test this with a long menu that uses a dialog
[04:14:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I discussed with arschmitz that we want to stop using dialog for custom select in 1.5 and fall back to native selectmenu if there are more than x options
[04:14:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, really?
[04:15:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, what do you think?
[04:15:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The filterable works with both a popup and a dialog.
[04:15:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: awesome
[04:16:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I dunno what the original motivation was for doing a dialog, but I suspect it was that maintaining the same look-and-feel is important even with many options.
[04:16:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: TBH I sometimes fail to see why we need to wrap form widgets at all. After all, the native ones /can/ be styled, right?
[04:16:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: s/wrap/enhance/
[04:17:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and, presumably, the native ones reflect the look-and-feel of the respective platform ...
[04:17:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I am not the biggest fan of custom selects to be honest
[04:17:57] <uGoMobi> UI is working on new selectmenu
[04:18:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool ...
[04:18:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, custom selects generate a lot of DOM. A lot.
[04:18:57] <frequent> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: hey
[04:19:04] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Hey!
[04:19:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: dialog widget will be gone and becomes option in page widget in 1.5 so you would get a page inside a page... wonder if that gives more problems
[04:19:21] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[04:19:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: anyway, I am in favor of simplifying things
[04:19:49] <frequent> I +1 the dialog option
[04:20:56] <frequent> uGoMobi: just found: http://famo.us/c/
[04:21:21] <frequent> looks nifty on video :-)
[04:23:31] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Bah! *wave* ... their big insight: "Replace CSS transformations with a custom matrix." Wow!
[04:24:07] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok. I had not looked under the hood.
[04:24:40] <_|Nix|_> frequent: They made a splash a while back. They have this bold claim that they'll solve all your performance issues. Riiiiiight *scoff*
[04:25:32] <frequent> _|Nix|_: :-)
[04:26:16] <frequent> _|Nix|_: though I like the idea of supporting TVs.

[04:35:38] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah. Didn't take much. It was /almost/ working.
[04:36:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, how do you put a large list all over the page.
[04:37:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, probably
[04:37:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: want to update current demos before adding new ones
[04:38:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I noticed an interesting thing on the demo page I just added. The popup no longer re-centres itself when you open another collapsible (like, for example, when you click on "JS" ).
[04:41:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll have a look at that.
[04:41:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm, interesting indeed. wonder if it will still be like that after we updated everything there
[04:43:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, should I leave it until everything is updated?

[05:31:30] <arschmitz> wow almost down to 250 open issues
[05:32:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, nice job on triage again!
[05:32:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: panel issue http://view.jquerymobile.com/panel-issues/demos/test/panels/
[05:33:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nav to page B, then page A or C, then back to B
[05:33:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i swear i closed at leat 10 issues for query params 
[05:33:48] <uGoMobi> yeah, query params are popular :)
[05:34:12] <arschmitz> yeah they were all dups though lol 
[05:34:30] <arschmitz> ok so whats the issue i did that sequence but dont see anything out of place?
[05:34:37] <uGoMobi> when you are back at page B open the right panel
[05:34:58] <uGoMobi> you will see the header jumps back
[05:35:03] <arschmitz> ok
[05:35:13] <uGoMobi> here are some facts...
[05:35:24] <uGoMobi> it only happens with the external toolbar
[05:35:51] <uGoMobi> it only happens after the page has been created, then removed, and then created again
[05:36:04] <arschmitz> hmmm
[05:36:11] <uGoMobi> it doesn't happen with the left external panel, only the right internal panel
[05:36:29] <uGoMobi> the cause is this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/panel-issues/js/widgets/panel.js#L251
[05:37:05] <uGoMobi> for some reason self._open && e.target !== self.element[ 0 ] return both true
[05:37:23] <arschmitz> ohmmm
[05:38:04] <arschmitz> wait then why dosent it close the panel?
[05:38:30] <uGoMobi> exactly
[05:38:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it doesn't even remove the open class from the toolbar, only the position and display class
[05:39:03] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:39:06] <arschmitz> i noticed
[05:39:19] <arschmitz> i need to pull this branch and look closer
[05:40:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the classes that are added to the container (body) are removed too
[05:41:09] <uGoMobi> the wrapper and fixed internal footer are just fine though
[05:41:21] <arschmitz> very weird
[05:41:42] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:41:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks for looking into it
[05:42:14] <arschmitz> no problem thats a weird one
[05:45:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:49:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this does not happen with overlay
[05:50:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, because in that case we don't do anything with toolbars and we don't wrap
[05:50:23] <arschmitz> oh yeah 
[05:51:19] <arschmitz> oh i think i might know whats happening
[05:53:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok i figured it out
[05:53:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: wow that's quick
[05:53:19] <uGoMobi> I am all ears
[05:53:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont have it fixed yet but found the problem
[05:53:56] <arschmitz> when you click that link its opening twice and closing once all at the same time
[05:54:10] <arschmitz> so what you see is the conglomeration of classes left by them racing each other
[05:54:45] <arschmitz> so now i just need to figure out why this is happening
[05:54:54] <arschmitz> im guessing a listen is being bound twice
[05:55:01] <uGoMobi> I see
[05:55:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: because whats happening is it opens ok then the listener fires again and it says wait im already open and starts closing
[05:55:49] <uGoMobi> yeah makes sense
[05:55:52] <arschmitz> but it has not even finished opening yet
[05:56:01] <arschmitz> from the first time becasue of the transition
[05:56:34] <arschmitz> so just need to make sure we are only binding once
[05:58:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it only happens after page has been removed before
[05:58:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so it could be that we don't destroy properly?
[05:58:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah because the event is not being unbound
[05:58:41] <arschmitz> yup
[06:00:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I guess it is because we only unbind when there are no other panels
[06:00:47] <arschmitz> yeah 
[06:00:54] <arschmitz> thats it i already fixed it :)
[06:01:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome, thanks a lot!
[06:01:16] <arschmitz> i just want to test a few things
[06:01:22] <arschmitz> and ill push the change
[06:01:26] <uGoMobi> ok great

[06:28:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok got it now
[06:28:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: was a bit more complex a fix then i thought but its fixed
[06:29:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/ The link for "jQuery Mobile git build - theme" reads http://code.jquery.com/mobile/git/jquery.mobilt-git.css
[06:29:29] <_|Nix|_> "mobilt"
[06:30:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome
[06:30:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: was kinda my my fault i think i lead you in a wrong direction when you were fixing destroy 
[06:30:20] <arschmitz> the binding on the clicks needs to use _on to work properlu
[06:30:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: np, glad you got it fixed
[06:31:11] <arschmitz> i was thinking this is a global handler in the sense that it should be shared but its not because what it does after the click is specific to that instance
[06:31:24] <uGoMobi> click,panel
[06:31:42] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:31:54] <arschmitz> so i just refactored to use _on and its fine now
[06:31:55] <uGoMobi> yeah $.mobile.document makes it look global
[06:32:19] <arschmitz> yeah i had looked to quick with out thinking it through completely
[06:32:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we just have to retest https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6309#issuecomment-22490475
[06:32:29] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6309 by tschettler (5d 7h ago): Panel: Link listener fires on removed panel
[06:32:40] <uGoMobi> it happens
[06:33:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _on fixes this specificly
[06:33:20] <uGoMobi> yeah, it should
[06:33:33] <uGoMobi> no need to add that unbind code to destroy method
[06:33:51] <arschmitz> yeah i already updated it
[06:33:54] <arschmitz> to remove that
[06:34:10] <uGoMobi> nice, less is more :)
[06:34:32] <uGoMobi> curious if this fixes the panels on WP8
[06:34:43] <uGoMobi> but I am afraid not
[06:34:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: whats the issue there?
[06:35:14] <uGoMobi> fixed toolbars disappear
[06:35:23] <arschmitz> oh weird
[06:35:29] <uGoMobi> and the wrapper to but I can fixed that by removing overflow-x hidden
[06:35:39] <arschmitz> hmm
[06:36:07] <uGoMobi> now I think of it, both footer and header disappear on that test page so it won't be related to the issue you just fixed
[06:36:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: Whaddya think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3202?
[06:36:26] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #3202 by IvanTheBearable (20mon 1w ago): formaction attribute on buttons does not work
[06:36:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Should I try and fix it?
[06:36:42] <_|Nix|_> It seems like a fairly basic omission.
[06:37:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah and that is something that really should work
[06:37:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i say go for it
[06:37:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool. I think we have all the tools in place for fixing this, since we track which button caused the submit.
[06:37:56] <uGoMobi> let's check what we still have to do for 1.4 alpha 2
[06:38:06] <_|Nix|_> Oh, so it's gonna be alpha2, eh?
[06:38:17] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[06:38:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah we made quite some changes and merged autoinit
[06:39:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats a pretty big bug though to we break both spec and native behavior so if its a quick fix i think its important.
[06:39:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: would this formaction bug be something that can be fixed between alpha and beta?
[06:39:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its a bug for sure and an old one so yet
[06:39:48] <arschmitz> yes
[06:39:59] <uGoMobi> I agree we should fix it for 14
[06:40:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: RE shim in page
[06:40:30] <uGoMobi> just checking if we there is something else that has higher priority for 1.4 alpha 2
[06:40:44] <arschmitz> We just need to make sure with AMB that page comes first if your using autoinit
[06:40:46] <uGoMobi> s/if we there/if there/
[06:41:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: gotcha im not sure what we have left for low hanging stuff there unless there is something with filterable ?
[06:41:34] <_|Nix|_> I think it's a /real/ quick fix:
[06:41:35] <_|Nix|_> 			url = ( $lastVClicked && $lastVClicked.attr( "formaction" ) ) ||
[06:41:35] <_|Nix|_> 				$form.attr( "action" );
[06:41:47] <_|Nix|_> Instead of url = $form.attr( "action" );
[06:41:56] <_|Nix|_> Yes, I know, variable names, etc., etc.
[06:41:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that does indeed seem pretty quick
[06:42:02] <arschmitz> lol
[06:42:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  go for it
[06:42:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have a question for you
[06:42:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is that custom select flterable stuff on master? so I can take care of CSS
[06:42:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The problem with making sure the page comes first is that if there's no dependency, then there's no guarantee on the order.
[06:43:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes. I pushed it.
[06:43:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok thank
[06:43:12] <uGoMobi> thanks
[06:43:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In practice, of course, the modules are read from left to right, so the leftmost will appear first in the file.
[06:44:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Still, that's merely a side effect of the way resolution works, and not a formal specification that that is to be the order.
[06:45:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you can fix in builder because makes core come first no matter what
[06:46:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and page is part of core
[06:47:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: loader does not respect this because in builder this is also a non optional part of core
[06:47:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I kinda don't like the fact that the download builder duplicates a lot of the behaviour of AMD.
[06:47:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Download builder should be relying on grunt --modules=<list,generated,from,user,choices>
[06:48:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and worse, it adds special cases.
[06:48:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah eventually we will be using same as ui 
[06:50:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what is the point of dns in $.mobile.getAttribute?
[06:50:34] <arschmitz> shouldnt it always be $.mobile.ns or just use $.fn.attr 
[06:50:46] <arschmitz> not $.mobile.getAttribute
[06:52:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: dns is so you don't have to write "data-" + $.mobile.ns + "whatever" in a million places.
[06:52:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Instead, you can just write "whatever", true.
[06:52:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right but why is it a param?
[06:52:52] <arschmitz> why is it passed it why not just use $.mobile.ns no matter what?
[06:53:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because you may want to retrieve a native attribute.
[06:53:28] <arschmitz> then why not use .getAttribute?
[06:53:33] <arschmitz> or attr
[06:54:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: To use attr you need a jQuery object.
[06:54:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You shouldn't need to create one just to use .attr.
[06:54:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok so why not use getAttribute in that case?
[06:54:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Otherwise, it converts for you.
[06:54:36] <arschmitz> the native one
[06:54:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: getAttribute() does not convert.
[06:54:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: "true" -> true, etc.
[06:58:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what native attribute would need type conversion though?
[06:58:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: min, max, step, selected, 
[06:59:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bottom line is, it's .attr() without having to create a jQuery object.
[07:00:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and it namespaces.
[07:00:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just fixed those typos in the Mobile git build CDN links
[07:01:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm im not really sure this warrents abstraction its pretty easy to just var min = parseFloat( element.getAttribute( "min" );
[07:01:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome!
[07:02:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it does not even add an extra line
[07:02:35] <uGoMobi> I suppose it has to be manually redeployed before changes are visible on the site
[07:03:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess we can go through the code and systematically remove references to .jqmData() and $.mobile.getAttribute()
[07:03:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: $.mobile.getAttribute im fine with
[07:03:39] <arschmitz> i just think we should remove the DNS param
[07:03:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's cleaner with it.
[07:03:49] <arschmitz> and have it just handle data- attributes
[07:03:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IMO.
[07:04:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: how so ?
[07:04:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see.
[07:04:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's cleaner to not perform string manipulation in a function argument.
[07:05:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: someFunction( element, "something", true ); is cleaner than someFunction( element, "data-" + $.mobile.ns + "something" );
[07:05:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Again, IMO, so feel free to change it.
[07:05:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont want to change the data- functionality
[07:05:52] <arschmitz> just make it use $.mobile.ns no matter what
[07:06:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right.
[07:06:02] <arschmitz> and handle native elements inline
[07:06:15] <arschmitz> so this would only effect like min max selected etc
[07:08:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. That's cool.
[07:09:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll make a pass over the attributes after I've written a test for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3202.
[07:09:38] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #3202 by IvanTheBearable (20mon 1w ago): formaction attribute on buttons does not work
[07:09:57] <arschmitz> awesome thanks
[07:13:51] <tj_vantoll> Give the <select> a class of form-control.
[07:14:20] <tj_vantoll> Ah, wrong window again. I have to stop doing that.
[07:20:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: re: navbar buttons and buttonMarkup... maybe we should not exclude them in buttonMarkup initSelector because of performance. Maybe we can do something like if the link has data-role="button" attribute we remove class ui-corner-all
[07:21:11] <uGoMobi> just for 1.4 until
[07:21:20] <uGoMobi> we reviewed navbar widget
[07:21:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i mean i think whatever works
[07:22:15] <uGoMobi> I guess the buttons also get unwanted ui-btn-shadow class
[07:22:25] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:22:28] <arschmitz> because its small enough case i dont think performance will be too too big
[07:22:36] <arschmitz> so what ever is the easiest fix 
[07:23:11] <uGoMobi> yeah but in buttonMarkup "not" will affect performance even if you don't have a navbar at all
[07:24:19] <arschmitz> oh true
[07:24:39] <arschmitz> so lets try and avoid that

[08:05:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[08:05:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[08:05:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just wanted to pass on some feedback on new themes
[08:05:36] <arschmitz> i got from someone i help a lot on #jquery
[08:05:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[08:05:56] <arschmitz> they thing the listview dividers for theme b are kinda hard to read
[08:06:07] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:06:18] <uGoMobi> I agree theme B has some contrast issues
[08:06:20] <arschmitz> and dont differentiate very much from the list items
[08:06:29] <arschmitz> yeah exactly
[08:06:34] <uGoMobi> true
[08:06:46] <arschmitz> but overall they really like both 1.4 and the new themes
[08:07:00] <arschmitz> that was their one issue
[08:07:00] <uGoMobi> that's great to hear
[08:07:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will tweak theme B a bit
[08:07:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: awesome 
[08:07:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: toddmparker also mentioned he was going to take a look at it
[08:07:48] <uGoMobi> also good if multiple people look at on different screens
[08:08:12] <uGoMobi> such a big difference when I look at pc laptop and macbook
[08:08:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ah yeah thats one thing i like with my setup
[08:08:59] <arschmitz> i have macbook hooked to 2 externals so i can drag back and forth to see difference
[08:09:01] <arschmitz>  :)
[08:09:17] <uGoMobi> specially when you use same color, just different shades it's hard to find good combinations
[08:09:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah that's nice
[08:09:39] <arschmitz> yeah it looks much better on mac monitor it seems
[08:09:45] <uGoMobi> true
[08:09:57] <arschmitz> no surprise because its a lot sharper 
[08:10:38] <uGoMobi> on my pc it also depends a lot from which angle I look
[08:10:58] <uGoMobi> anyway, I will tweak the B bar style
[08:11:05] <uGoMobi> hope we get some more feedback
[08:15:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm do you know why this is happening
[08:15:11] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/177/edit ?
[08:15:24] <arschmitz> the second button is not inline and covers first?
[08:16:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: first thought is the changes in buttonMarkup
[08:16:21] <uGoMobi> similar to the navbar buttons issue
[08:16:43] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:16:55] <uGoMobi> although, you don't have data-role button there
[08:17:00] <uGoMobi> hmm
[08:17:00] <arschmitz> someone just asked me how to do 2 right buttons so i did that and was like woooo
[08:17:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah auto enhancment in toolbars
[08:17:18] <arschmitz> deprecated but still works
[08:17:24] <uGoMobi> oh there are two ui-btn-left classes
[08:18:05] <arschmitz> can you only do it to 1 button i thought before you could do that to basicly float 2 buttons left maybe my memory is bad lol
[08:18:44] <uGoMobi> dunno actually, but there is an issue here... they are semi enhanced :/
[08:18:58] <uGoMobi> enhanced as button but not inline and icon-only
[08:19:20] <uGoMobi> so it looks like the changes in buttonMarkup caused this.
[08:19:24] <gseguin> mornin'
[08:19:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: unless we added a check if the buttons already have that ui-btn-left/right class
[08:19:48] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[08:20:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually 1.3 is the same basicly
[08:20:15] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/178/edit
[08:20:27] <uGoMobi> yeah, just saw it changing on my screen :)
[08:20:32] <arschmitz> lol
[08:20:33] <gseguin> uGoMobi: did you have a happy birthday?
[08:20:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so issue here but not a new one
[08:20:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah, was nice, thanks!
[08:24:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well easy to work around at least :)
[08:24:55] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/179/edit
[08:26:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's weird, if wrapped they do get the inline button class
[08:27:16] <uGoMobi> now I am not sure anymore if we add a class to make them inline or just set inline-block for any button in the header
[08:28:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: .ui-header .ui-btn, .ui-footer .ui-btn sets them in inline block
[08:28:32] <uGoMobi> ah ok, we do that with CSS now
[08:28:53] <arschmitz> yeah so all header buttons get inline
[08:29:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I already see the problem
[08:29:45] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/177/edit
[08:30:02] <uGoMobi> the 2nd button gets ui-btn-left and -right class
[08:30:14] <uGoMobi> so we set left: 5px; and right: 5px
[08:31:05] <uGoMobi> right: auto for the 2nd button should fix it
[08:31:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ah ok 
[08:31:52] <uGoMobi> don't think we have to fix it in framework CSS
[08:32:05] <uGoMobi> because 2 ui-btn-left classes isn't really supported
[08:32:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i just thought it worked before but it didnt
[08:32:27] <arschmitz> so im not too worried
[08:32:46] <arschmitz> and super easy to make it work just add a wrapper and add ui-btn-left / right to that
[08:32:49] <arschmitz> and it works perfect

[12:02:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am still running into new panel issues
[12:02:35] <arschmitz> anything else you need help with?
[12:02:54] <uGoMobi> it's more CSS
[12:03:02] <uGoMobi> the responsive CSS doesn't work anymore
[12:03:07] <arschmitz> ah ok
[12:03:19] <uGoMobi> because the classes are all added when starting to open
[12:03:48] <uGoMobi> we had a class that was only added when opening was complete
[12:04:10] <uGoMobi> and the dismiss layer CSS is causing some issues
[12:05:00] <uGoMobi> I also noticed issues with custom select when testing my changes to make widget inherit from overlay (body)
[12:05:12] <uGoMobi> we add a wrong class there
[12:05:40] <uGoMobi> so i think i might be busy for a while
[12:06:30] <arschmitz> bummer
[12:06:38] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:08:04] <arschmitz> well im just plugging away on some issues and this focus thing so let me know if you need anything
[12:08:06] <uGoMobi> but I think/hope that we can move to beta and rc quickly if we test thoroughly now
[12:08:16] <arschmitz> yup
[12:08:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok will do, thanks
[12:09:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I saw that _|Nix|_ mentioned something about page last night
[12:09:22] <uGoMobi> not sure if you guys already discussed that
[12:09:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i already talked to him about that earlier
[12:09:27] <arschmitz> yup
[12:09:29] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:09:51] <arschmitz> its not an issue with the way the download builder works page is part of core and so always load before all other widgets
[12:10:18] <uGoMobi> just wanted to mention that when I was using removepagebackground method from page in panel widget I got prior to initialization errors
[12:10:44] <uGoMobi> I removed that code and used .content() instead
[12:10:53] <uGoMobi> to set theme
[12:10:55] <arschmitz> hmm i might need to look at that then
[12:11:01] <arschmitz> for backcompat
[12:11:33] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:11:34] <arschmitz> was that in demos or a build?
[12:12:00] <uGoMobi> it was local
[12:12:02] <arschmitz> oh also was it an external panel?
[12:12:21] <uGoMobi> no the internal ones
[12:12:27] <arschmitz> ok
[12:12:32] <arschmitz> ohhhh
[12:12:44] <uGoMobi> that was the strange thing
[12:12:45] <arschmitz> in the index.php navigation comes after page
[12:13:02] <arschmitz> so in theory page could exist before content
[12:13:16] <arschmitz> not sure how that would happen though because content calls page
[12:13:36] <arschmitz> hrm...... ill have to try to reproduce
[12:14:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I can create a branch from panel-issues branch and revert the change I made to resolve it
[12:15:04] <uGoMobi> then you can reproduce
[12:16:28] <arschmitz> ok awesome
[12:16:35] <arschmitz> when ever you have time just let me know
[12:17:12] <uGoMobi> yeah now in the middle of making changes there but will do that when i am done

[12:56:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you around
[13:20:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am not really sure what to do with this reponsive panel dismissible issue
[13:20:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok whats going on?
[13:20:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can I pick your brain?
[13:20:52] <arschmitz> of course
[13:20:55] <uGoMobi> here it comes..
[13:21:30] <uGoMobi> when we create a panel we create a dismiss div
[13:22:22] <uGoMobi> when you add class ui-responsive-panel to a page we hide this div
[13:22:32] <uGoMobi> if it's a push panel
[13:23:19] <uGoMobi> we used to append the dismiss div to the page but with external panels we have to append it to the container
[13:23:32] <arschmitz> ok
[13:23:53] <uGoMobi> because the dismiss div can be before a page in the dom I can't target it with CSS
[13:24:53] <uGoMobi> not sure what to do with this, because I don't really feel like doing DOM manip to fix it
[13:25:52] <uGoMobi> it's only to disable dismissable at wider screens if display mode is push
[13:26:39] <uGoMobi> so I don't like to create the dismiss div when you open the panel and remove it when closing
[13:27:16] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:28:03] <arschmitz> hmm
[13:28:08] <uGoMobi> can think of some other JS solutions... checking if page has the responsive class and then add it to the modal
[13:28:30] <uGoMobi> checking if page comes after modal when opening the panel and if so move the modal
[13:28:38] <uGoMobi> nothing that I like :(
[13:28:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok give me just a sec
[13:28:51] <uGoMobi> sure
[13:29:28] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06panel-issues: 02http://git.io/01qG0A
[13:29:28] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06panel-issues 145e582b3 15Jasper de Groot: Panel: Wrapper and fixed toolbar open classes only needed for responsive panels.
[13:33:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: when we append the dismiss div
[13:33:29] <arschmitz> does it have to be appended?
[13:33:36] <arschmitz> or could it be prepended?
[13:34:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: doesn't matter
[13:34:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: because we get it on top of the page with z-index
[13:35:11] <uGoMobi> but it has to be appended to make this responsive CSS work
[13:36:28] <uGoMobi> and if a new page is created that has an external panel which is already enhanced (dismiss modal is already in DOM), that page has to come before the modal too
[13:36:50] <uGoMobi> but it won't
[13:37:43] <uGoMobi> so this doesn't match anymore: .ui-responsive-panel.ui-page-active ~ .ui-panel-dismiss-display-push { display: none; }	
[13:37:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh shoot that blows my idea
[13:38:13] <arschmitz> yeah that was basicly what i was thinking lol
[13:38:42] <arschmitz> need one that goes the other way every X thats has a y after it lol
[13:38:53] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:39:25] <uGoMobi> I am thinking about removing it from the preset CSS
[13:39:27] <arschmitz> there is one other choice
[13:39:47] <arschmitz> just document that for external panels add the class to body
[13:39:54] <arschmitz> not page
[13:39:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yup
[13:40:25] <arschmitz> that maintains the hierarchy so should solve the issue right?
[13:40:26] <uGoMobi> I already made it all work for when class is on body
[13:40:38] <arschmitz> ok then i think thats fine
[13:40:55] <arschmitz> because external panels are new so they dont need to work 100% the same as internal
[13:41:03] <uGoMobi> yeah then I can just use .ui-responsive-panel .ui-panel-dismiss-display-push
[13:41:10] <arschmitz> exactly
[13:41:46] <arschmitz> and in docs change it from saying add to page to add to panel's parent
[13:42:01] <arschmitz> then it covers both cases
[13:42:13] <uGoMobi> acually I can remove half of the selectors if we document it like that
[13:42:25] <arschmitz> there you go!
[13:42:34] <arschmitz> im sold lol
[13:42:50] <uGoMobi> great
[13:42:52] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:43:04] <arschmitz> some times you just gotta talk it out :)
[13:43:07] <uGoMobi> thanks for helping figuring it out
[13:43:14] <uGoMobi> yes exactly
[13:43:32] <arschmitz> man panels have been 1 major pain right from the begining
[13:43:54] <arschmitz> easy for websites to do 1 offs but to handle different modes and content makes them crazy
[13:44:45] <uGoMobi> yeah very true
