[05:28:22] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I stopped apache and mysql on that server, no more running out of memory
[05:29:26] <jzaefferer> kborchers: looking good!
[05:29:35] <jzaefferer> much better than a separate page, I agree with that
[05:29:43] <jzaefferer> the two columns need some rebalancing
[05:30:15] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, i was thinking the same thing. i think i should have some time to night to play with a bit more
[05:31:05] <jzaefferer> kborchers: History can be much further down. Maybe move Getting started to where Get Involved is, and move that below the Download section
[05:31:16] <jzaefferer> and then put History below whatever content is smaller
[05:31:40] <kborchers> ok, that sounds like it could work
[05:32:23] <jzaefferer> stage preview is great :-)
[05:32:53] <kborchers> jzaefferer: any thoughts on a different accent color? there is so much green and using green for the heading color doesn't really make things pop but with so much green, i was having trouble thinking of a color that would work without totally clashing or looking out of place
[05:33:24] <jzaefferer> kborchers: uhm
[05:34:07] <jzaefferer> kborchers: http://kuler.adobe.com/#themes/search?term=green
[05:34:30] <jzaefferer> kborchers: maybe http://kuler.adobe.com/#themeID/1146803
[05:35:04] <kborchers> i was thinking something like that but kind of looks like christmas
[05:35:16] <kborchers> maybe the darker red
[05:35:23] <kborchers> i'll play with it
[05:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers jzaefferer kswedberg: Thoughts? https://gist.github.com/74574a617cc84fcb51d8
[05:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> This removes the need for preprocessing for includes.
[05:45:28] <kswedberg> looks cool.
[05:45:56] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: just curious, is there a significant downside to preprocessing?
[05:46:53] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Not that I know of, but what was happening was <note> was being handled differently than <widget-inherit>.
[05:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> But they looked the same.
[05:46:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez kborchers: if we can use that to get rid of all preprocessing, +1
[05:47:02] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that works for me as long as we don't need to do any transformation before it's included. i thought i had a situation where that might have been needed but now don't remember so must not have been :P
[05:47:04] <scott_gonzalez> And the XSL was pretty confusing to me.
[05:47:17] <jzaefferer> simplifying XSL is worth a lot
[05:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> Because <note id="x"> would turn into <note id="x"><note>content</note></note>
[05:47:23] <jzaefferer> remember our ant build?
[05:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> And <widget-inherit> would actually get replaced with the contents, excatly like an include.
[05:48:08] <kswedberg> ok. I'm +1. just wanted to know what the rationale was to getting rid of preprocessing.
[05:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> So with <note>, the final XSL was confusing because it was parsing with "note/note" as a selector.
[05:48:25] <kswedberg> gotcha
[05:48:46] <scott_gonzalez> I was also having a hard time understanding all the indentity transforms that occurred.
[05:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers: The other option is to move the inherited stuff direclty into the XSL, which I did for notes in core.
[05:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/commit/7970a0efcf905d4a59c335e74ecd279734a96b31
[05:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> I like having notes in the XSL because it means that <placeholder> doesn't exist anymore.
[05:50:47] <scott_gonzalez> It just uses actual XSL to insert the values.
[05:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> So we could do the same with the widget-inherit stuff.
[05:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> The widget-inherit value replacement is hacked together right now anyway.
[05:51:28] <kswedberg> your call
[05:51:31] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries2html-base.xsl#L251-254
[05:51:39] <scott_gonzalez> All placeholders are forced to the entry name :-/
[05:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> I noticed that when I was looking at how <note> worked in core, which had proper placholder support.
[05:52:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i guess i would be ok with that … mostly a personal preference thing but i don't like a bunch of text-content in my XSL but if it simplifies i'm +1.
[05:53:02] <kborchers> yeah,  i was never a huge fan of the placeholder stuff
[05:53:31] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the XSL is essentially a template, right?
[05:53:33] <kswedberg> kborchers: I said pretty much the same thing to scott_gonzalez last night. (re text-content in xsl)
[05:53:57] <kborchers> kswedberg: :)
[05:53:58] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: yeah, but it's a structural transformation template
[05:54:11] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ^^^
[05:55:00] <kswedberg> but, like kborchers, I'm +1 if it simplifies. And I'd rather get stuff done than bike shed. and you're getting stuff done. so who am I to stand in your way? :)
[05:56:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I'll try to get this <widget-inherit> stuff done with <xi:include> and <placeholder>.
[05:56:22] <scott_gonzalez> If I get that working properly, we can move notes back into their own xml files and do an <xi:include> to get them out of the XSL.
[05:56:55] <scott_gonzalez> I kind of like the way notes work right now though :-)
[05:57:04] <scott_gonzalez> Especially if they're moved into their own file as notes.xsl.
[05:57:59] <kswedberg> especially that.
[05:58:01] <kswedberg> unrelated: is anyone else getting a parse error locally web-base-template sunrise.php?
[05:58:13] <kswedberg> *locally in
[05:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> Let me pull and check.
[05:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...already up to date.
[05:58:49] <kswedberg> syntax error, unexpected T_FUNCTION in .../web-base-template/sunrise.php on line 28
[05:59:04] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: are you on master or legacy?
[05:59:08] <kswedberg> branch
[05:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> master
[05:59:28] <kswedberg> hmm. maybe I have to update to WP 3.4.1
[05:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: What version of PHP are you using?
[05:59:43] <kswedberg> oh, good question. lemme check
[06:00:11] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's a syntax error, you're probably on an old version that doesn't support anonymous functions.
[06:00:36] <kswedberg> wooooops! yeah, was on 5.2.17
[06:00:58] <kswedberg> all better!
[06:01:06] <kswedberg> thx scott_gonzalez :)
[06:01:13] <scott_gonzalez> no problem :-)
[06:02:11] <kborchers> hmmm, looks like gnarf's bouncer may have lost connection. did i miss anything?
[06:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing important. Just kswedberg being on an old version of PHP :-P
[06:03:16] * kswedberg is doofus
[06:03:39] <kborchers> ok, last i saw was kswedberg talking about the template being a structural transformation template then i see kswedberg saying all better
[06:04:21] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, so you missed this:
[06:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> I kind of like the way notes work right now though
[06:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> Especially if they're moved into their own file as notes.xsl.
[06:04:48] <scott_gonzalez> And then... kswedberg: especially that.
[06:06:00] <kborchers> ok, like i said. i don't like the text content in there but if it's a separate file, it makes it a little better and if it makes it easier for someone contributing to grok then i can be convinced :)
[06:06:41] <kswedberg> kborchers, I said this while you were out: "like kborchers, I'm +1 if it simplifies. And I'd rather get stuff done than bike shed. and you're getting stuff done. so who am I to stand in your way? :)"
[06:06:55] <kborchers> +1
[06:06:56] <kswedberg> which sounds pretty much like what you just said
[06:07:02] <kborchers> yep :)

[11:42:16] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ping
[11:42:25] <kswedberg> hey
[11:43:31] <scott_gonzalez> I've noticed that there's a lot of information that isn't displayed on the current API site.
[11:43:35] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[11:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> The types and defaults for arguments aren't listed.
[11:44:12] <scott_gonzalez> And for options like specialEasing, the "(added 1.4)" is part of the actual description.
[11:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> I assume we want to show all the info.
[11:44:41] <kswedberg> yeah, types are there, too, but also part of the description
[11:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> The designers worked off of the existing site, so types and defaults are missing from those designs.
[11:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> If we can figure out how we want the info presented, I can get everything in the right place.
[11:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[11:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> You can see types + defaults + descriptions for options
[11:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> And types + descriptions for event arguments.
[11:47:50] <kswedberg> speaking of which … what are the latest mockups that we should be going by for all these sites? When I was actually doing work on this stuff, I felt a little like I was running blind.
[11:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> Events also show arguments with properties.
[11:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, this is completely unstyled right now.
[11:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> They're in dropbox, but we don't actually have too many.
[11:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> Do you still have access to the jQuery dropbox?
[11:49:25] <scott_gonzalez> This is what we have to work from right now: https://www.dropbox.com/s/to3kjhc0ozvod44/API-Method2.png
[11:50:21] <kswedberg> No, I don't. because you know how untrustworthy I am. ;)

[13:24:32] <scott_gonzalez> WOOHOO! Core and UI can use the same XSL now.
[13:29:14] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Excellent :-) Also, just wanted to let you know that I will have no internet from thursday until the 5th Sept, so best to email me if there are things I need to change in Mobile.
[13:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I'll be copying the new XSL over to the mobile repo either tonight or tomorrow. The changes should be minimal, so I plan on making them at the same time.
[13:30:43] <agcolom> perfect! Thanks :-)
[13:31:32] <scott_gonzalez> It should just be a matter of a minor tweak to XPATHs for the selects in the code example template and adding <title> elements to the XML files.
[13:31:45] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think any other changes are necessary to support the updated XSL.
[13:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> Most of the work was in the core repo.
[13:32:43] <scott_gonzalez> The majority of changes in the UI repo were either just pulling in logic from core or pulling in bug fixes/improvements to the transforms.
[13:32:46] <agcolom> I saw that you added <title> to the xml files so I added that to mine as well.
[13:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, perfect, even less work when I move the XSL over :-)
[13:33:11] <agcolom> (my xml)
[13:33:16] <agcolom> xml file!
