[02:49:38] <Ibrahim> Hello I want to join you in this project and I don't know exactly what I have to do ..can any one help me?
[03:19:37] <agcolom> Ibrahim: could you please be specific about which project you are interested in?
[03:21:19] <Ibrahim> it's jQuery Foundation .. I don't know if I have to choose one of those ideas to work on or what
[03:25:50] <agcolom> Ibrahim: yes, you need to pick one project and develop a proposal for it. Some more info can be found at https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/issues/1
[05:07:57] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:18:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: pong!
[05:20:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:20:21] <apsdehal> arschmitz: I read documentation for intern. Found the QUnit interface of it, but it hasn't been documented properly and there isn't any example of it available anywhere.
[05:20:21] <apsdehal> Are you sure we want to use that interface to simply wrap over current QUnit tests?
[05:20:40] <arschmitz> apsdehal: yes
[05:20:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Your updated qunit-assert-classes requires at least qunit 1.15.0, because that's when push() first appears inside assert, and you use this.push(), and the context is assert()
[05:21:27] <arschmitz> apsdehal: heh maybe i need to reopen your PR ^^
[05:21:34] <gabriel_schulhof> I've tried adding qunit 1.15.0 in my boilerplate PR to make the widget backcompat tests pass, but I'm getting an error when running grunt updateDependencies
[05:22:17] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, I'm wondering: Could you update ui-1-12 to at least QUnit 1.15.0?
[05:22:28] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm wondering whether grunt updateDependencies will fail for you as well.
[05:22:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: apsdehal made this already https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7986
[05:23:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, great!
[05:23:29] <gabriel_schulhof> I assume this was merged after you've rebased ui-1-12 onto master, right?
[05:23:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: if we have any issues with the qunit interface the person who wrote both it and intern has offered any help we need and to fix any thing we need
[05:23:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it was not merged read my comment
[05:24:28] <apsdehal> Yeah, QUnit version can be updated even if we are moving to intern, since as mentioned in intern documentation, intern will support older QUnit versions to some extent.
[05:24:43] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, but this is blocking the adoption of the boilerplate too, because the widget backcompat tests are now failing.
[05:25:20] <arschmitz> apsdehal: that interface supports 1.16 i think
[05:25:31] <arschmitz> whatever current was when it was written
[05:25:40] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and there's no way we can use the new qunit-assert-classes if we don't move up to at least 1.15.0
[05:25:42] <arschmitz> apsdehal: but they will update it if we need
[05:25:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: right thats why i said maybe i should re-open it to apsdehal
[05:26:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes, please!
[05:26:47] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and once that lands, I can rebase ui-1-12 again, and then the tests will pass once more.
[05:29:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[05:30:32] <arschmitz> apsdehal: we discussed intern in our last meeting and made a unanimous decision to make the move
[05:30:56] <gabriel_schulhof> What's the timeframe for the move though? 1.5.0?
[05:31:13] <gabriel_schulhof> We already have a lot to do for 1.5.0, is why I'm asking?
[05:31:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: intern?
[05:31:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[05:31:46] <arschmitz> august ish
[05:31:58] <arschmitz> its going to be a GSoC project
[05:32:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Aaaah, OK.
[05:32:07] <arschmitz> i hope anyway apsdehal :-)
[05:32:24] <apsdehal> I was adding Grunt tasks for now. Plus adding intern dependencies
[05:32:36] <arschmitz> apsdehal: sounds good
[05:33:06] <arschmitz> apsdehal: im going to reopen that pr if i do think you could back out the api updates?
[05:33:17] <arschmitz> and just do the version upgrade stuff
[05:33:22] <apsdehal> I need to check and through with QUnit interface, only mention available is here : https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/741
[05:33:54] <apsdehal> Yeah, reopen that. In the meantime I can ping leobalter
[05:35:02] <arschmitz> apsdehal: i dont want you to update the api
[05:35:10] <arschmitz> at all
[05:35:27] <arschmitz> apsdehal: we just need the newer version of qunit to use a plugin we need
[05:36:15] <apsdehal> Ok, cool. I should then work on shifting a unit test suite to intern to see how it works out.
[05:37:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I also noticed that about the current PR. It goes beyond simply updating the dependency on QUnit. That's not strictly necessary for qunit-assert-classes.
[05:37:47] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah thats why i asked him to back out the api updates
[05:37:55] <arschmitz> apsdehal: yes please
[05:38:14] <arschmitz> apsdehal: dont forget to do and submit your proposal though :-)
[05:38:19] <gabriel_schulhof> It should be as simple as git reset --hard HEAD~2; git push;
[05:38:42] <apsdehal> Yes
[05:38:51] <apsdehal> But it would be a force push
[05:39:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, true. Sorry!
[05:39:03] <arschmitz> apsdehal: thats fine
[05:39:21] <arschmitz> feel free to force push your branch
[05:43:47] <apsdehal> arschmitz: I have force pushed, kindly reopen the PR
[05:43:56] <arschmitz> will do
[05:44:47] <arschmitz> apsdehal: oh apparently github wont let me reopen after a force push
[05:44:59] <apsdehal> Then I am opening a new PR
[05:45:08] <arschmitz> apsdehal: perfect thank you
[05:45:23] * arschmitz needs to remember to reopen first next time
[05:46:40] <arschmitz> apsdehal: if you need intern help there is also a #intern 
[05:48:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh i did the style guide updates for mobile with esformatter yesterday
[05:48:26] <arschmitz> im working on prs for all the changes
[05:48:26] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15apsdehal opened pull request #8010: Tests: Updates to QUnit version 1.17.1 (06master...06test-upgradation) 02http://git.io/hYZY
[05:49:14] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Thanks for the info, I will take help from them too.
[05:50:39] <apsdehal> I have opened the PR. Merge it whenever you can.
[05:53:06] <arschmitz> apsdehal: i will check it thank you
[06:02:11] <arschmitz> apsdehal: looks like you have some failures on that PR
[06:04:08] <apsdehal> Checking
[06:05:38] <apsdehal> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/54713078#L450 I will fix these kind of error and push again
[06:28:43] <apsdehal> gabriel_schulhof: Any specific purpose of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/unit/init/init_core.js#L4 , git blame shows you added the line, tests fail because of this on new QUnit version 
[06:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Is the plan to land all of these style changes and enable a new set of checks?
[06:49:40] <leobalter> apsdehal arschmitz gabriel_schulhof catching up
[06:51:17] <gabriel_schulhof> apsdehal: I had to stop the test suite because the tests were being loaded via require(), so it was sometimes reporting success before the module had finished loading.
[06:52:36] <gabriel_schulhof> apsdehal: $.testHelper.asyncLoad() also stops the suite and then re-starts it when it's done loading modules.
[06:55:07] <arschmitz> leobalter: i don't think we actually need anything 
[06:55:13] <leobalter> ok
[06:55:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Cool (about the esformatter update).
[06:59:30] <gabriel_schulhof> apsdehal: Maybe you need to change that QUnit.stop() to QUnit.config.autostart = false, like it's done in $.testHelper.asyncLoad() ...
[07:46:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: enabling new checks is still problematic, since jscs forces us to upgrade everything at once. Maybe we can override the config for folders that we've updated, starting with ui/
[07:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> If we're making changes, I'd like to see them getting validated.
[07:50:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with configs that only run on certain files, we've done that before.

[10:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Are there places in Mobile where we'd be able to take advantage of this? https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pointer-events/2015JanMar/0033.html
[10:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> I can't think of any examples in UI.
[10:45:37] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: well sliders are mentioned there which we both have
[10:46:24] <arschmitz> we also have a swipe to close on panels which in theory could take advantage of it being direction specific
[10:46:27] <scott_gonzalez> I would never want our slider to switch to scrolling when you reach the end.
[10:47:51] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah that does seem odd
[10:48:52] <arschmitz> and we have like swipe left and right events so if someone wanted to swipe in one diretion and scroll in the other it could work
[10:49:04] <arschmitz> but all these examples seem a bit contrived to be honest
[10:49:51] <scott_gonzalez> There are legit use cases, but I can't think of places where we would want to use it.
[10:50:03] <scott_gonzalez> Even the panel opening/closing seems unneccesary.
[10:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's horizontal swiping.
[10:50:18] <arschmitz> thats what i meant cases within ui or mobile
[10:50:18] <scott_gonzalez> And you're unlikely to have horizontal scrolling.
[10:50:34] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: exactly we do everything we can to prevent it in mobile
[10:50:37] <arschmitz> for the most part
[10:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll express support from us, even though we don't have any use cases in our code.
[10:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> I just wanted to double check so that I could include our use cases if we had any.
[10:53:51] <arschmitz> yeah im certainly in support but cant see using it
[10:53:53] <arschmitz> in mobile
[12:42:19] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you have a script you've been using for generating a changelog from GitHub issues?
[12:42:31] <arschmitz> yup
[12:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> Got a link?
[12:43:19] <arschmitz> just a sec let me find it
[12:45:12] <arschmitz> this is not actually working because the part that hits github is commented out but should work if you uncomment think thats all iv been doing to run it https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.4-stable/build/tasks/changelog.js
[12:45:22] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[12:46:14] <arschmitz> its kinda a mess because i never finished it because of jquery-release but its been enough to get me by on the patch releases 
[12:47:47] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so you're not grabbing commit references for the issues.
[12:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> That matches what we do for Trac, since this is really just for double checking the commit changelog.
[12:49:01] <arschmitz> yup
[12:49:10] <arschmitz> thats directly adapted from your original ui one
[12:49:29] <arschmitz> just stubbing in github api
[12:50:31] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: for the most part its entirely from the commits since we are pretty picky on every commit being reviewed its very reliable.
[12:51:30] <arschmitz> so yeah like you said "just for double checking"
[12:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> Do you do anything for contributor gathering?
[12:51:57] <arschmitz> nope
[12:52:24] <arschmitz> we are not cool like ui thanking every one 
[12:52:32] <arschmitz> we are a bunch of jrks
[12:52:34] <arschmitz> jerks
[12:53:02] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:53:17] <scott_gonzalez> It's a lot more work to do this for GitHub.
[12:53:26] <arschmitz> yup thats why i didnt do it
[12:53:35] <arschmitz> it was a lot of work and i just never got that far
[12:57:53] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15matthewp opened issue #8011: package.json main pointing to the wrong file 02http://git.io/hs7b
[13:02:37] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Lot of tests are failing after upgrading, most of them are related to https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/54763360#L465, leobalter suggested a fix, but it doesn't seem to work.
[13:03:33] <arschmitz> apsdehal: honestly leobalter or jzaefferer would have a better idea on that 
[13:04:30] <arschmitz> apsdehal: maybe look through https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/1.17.0/History.md and https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/1.16.0/History.md
[13:05:07] <arschmitz> oh ha they do a single doc so just the first one sorry
[13:16:57] <gabriel_schulhof> apsdehal: I don't get it ... asyncLoad does exactly the same thing ...
[13:17:19] <gabriel_schulhof> apsdehal: Maybe we should try to re-write the init test using asyncLoad ...
[13:18:38] <apsdehal> Looking at this: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/440 for a fix, using QUnit.load and running tests
[13:37:56] <gabriel_schulhof> apsdehal: I was able to convert that test to using solely asyncLoad, which works.
[13:38:46] <gabriel_schulhof> apsdehal: I just had to tack "shared" onto window instead of using the requirejs module return value.
[13:39:34] <apsdehal> QUnit.load() also passes
[13:39:42] <apsdehal> Without any extra changes
[13:39:49] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, then let's do that.
[13:39:58] <gabriel_schulhof> It sounds a lot less invasive.
[13:40:09] <apsdehal> Just let me fix the other things that are failing
[13:40:14] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[13:45:52] <apsdehal> Now rest of that tests that are failing include https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/54763360#L508 , in which .attr('class') method is returning null instead of undefined
[13:48:08] <leobalter> @apsdehal, @gabriel_schulhof: I left some comments at that PR
[13:48:40] <leobalter> You don't need QUnit.load at all. :)
[13:50:13] <apsdehal> Yeah, checked, thanks
[13:59:19] <M4rius> Hi there, I wrote up a draft for the proposal. Would love your feedback :)  --> https://gist.github.com/bethge/b9f61769cc8bee323995 (ping jzaefferer,arschmitz)
[14:39:17] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Any idea about failing tests in which .attr('class') method is returning null instead of undefined? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2129 Maybe this pull is related
[14:57:06] <arschmitz> apsdehal: no thats for something new and what to do on things that are not actually dom nodes
[14:58:42] <apsdehal> These are the last tests that are failing on Travis: https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/54782714#L439
[14:59:11] <arschmitz> apsdehal: to be honest that looks like an absolutely terrible test
[14:59:29] <arschmitz> checking that class is equal to undefined
[14:59:44] <arschmitz> we should be checking it it actually has that class
[15:00:17] <apsdehal> Should I change the test to check that?
[15:06:36] <arschmitz> apsdehal: yes
[15:06:41] <arschmitz> i assume the rest are the same
