[05:12:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Morning
[05:15:36] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:15:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nice work on PR reviews!!!
[05:15:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ha ha
[05:16:04] <arschmitz> yeah went on a bit of a rampage
[05:16:05] <uGoMobi> awesome
[05:16:44] <arschmitz> there are a few more im going to look at more today and either merge or close
[05:16:55] <uGoMobi> ok great
[05:17:29] <arschmitz> anything with conflicts no response to cla or more then 6 months old pretty much got closed
[05:18:13] <uGoMobi> I just commented on cover transitions
[05:18:37] <arschmitz> awesome
[05:18:40] <arschmitz> i saw
[05:21:14] <arschmitz> im waiting people to see the notifications and the angry response to start flying lol
[05:23:13] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:23:28] <uGoMobi> I feel a bit bad that we never reviewed some of those PR's
[05:23:39] <arschmitz> yeah i agree
[05:24:04] <uGoMobi> but at the other hand,in many cases it were PR's without a ticket
[05:24:08] <arschmitz> prs should not hang around like issues
[05:24:21] <uGoMobi> I mean, there should always be a ticket that can be closed by merging the PR
[05:24:33] <arschmitz> yup even if its a feature request
[05:24:46] <uGoMobi> so we can first discuss if we do want to make the change or add the feature
[05:24:47] <arschmitz> and the issue can stay open even if the PR is closed
[05:24:49] <uGoMobi> yes
[05:25:04] <uGoMobi> to prevent that people do work for nothing
[05:25:12] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:25:21] <arschmitz> and just need to stay on top of PR reviews
[05:25:28] <arschmitz> i want it down to less then 5
[05:25:45] <arschmitz> then any that come in should be reviewed within a couple days in general and either closed or used
[05:25:56] <uGoMobi> +1
[05:26:17] <arschmitz> ill try and review everything that comes in from now on
[05:26:42] <uGoMobi> when we are done with 1.4 and discussed the roadmap I also want to cleanup all those feuture request tickets
[05:26:48] <arschmitz> to make sure its getting done i mean in general we only get 1 or 2 a week so its really not even that big a job
[05:26:58] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[05:27:08] <uGoMobi> yeah I agree
[05:27:53] <uGoMobi> we can discuss new PR's and feature requests during weekly meeting
[05:28:02] <uGoMobi> and make a decision right away
[05:28:04] <arschmitz> yup
[05:28:40] <uGoMobi> I'll make that a weekly agenda item
[05:31:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what do you think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5688?
[05:31:51] <arschmitz> i kinda think close as not a bug wont fix. because other wise if you have enabled and disabled ones side by side or even near each other both empty they will be different sizes
[05:32:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and i dont think im in favor of the visual inconsistency 
[05:32:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: reading the comments... one sec
[05:35:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: he submitted PR this morning for it 
[05:35:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, looking at that too
[05:37:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I agree that a disabled textarea shouldn't be different height than enabled one
[05:37:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so if the extra line is there from the beginning, it should be there in both cases
[05:38:06] <arschmitz> yup ok ill comment and close those then
[05:38:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's also what I mentioned in one of the comments... don't want extra line suddenly appear when enabling the textarea
[05:38:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: fixed the ruby on rails checkbox issue too
[05:38:34] <arschmitz> yeah and even aside from any visual jumps
[05:38:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you have been cranking! awesome!
[05:38:56] <arschmitz> i think it would be weird to have two different textareas that are both empty be 2 different heights
[05:40:13] <arschmitz> yeah i think i closed like 50 issues / pr's last night total
[05:40:28] <uGoMobi> nice!
[05:40:57] <arschmitz> actually was able to accept like 4 or 5 pr's too so it was not just closing

[05:57:32] <tj_vantoll> You're way ahead of us. (8 vs. 34 open)
[05:57:41] <arschmitz> we had 45
[05:57:44] <arschmitz> last night
[05:57:53] <tj_vantoll> Oh wow. Heck of a night.
[05:58:21] <arschmitz> lol yeah went crazy going through PR's
[06:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Whenever I finish this plugins site issue and do the next review of selectmenu, I can go through PRs with you
[06:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: You forgot to fix the author name when you landed the checkbox() fix.
[06:03:18] <tj_vantoll> Ah, didn't even think about that. You mean in git?
[06:03:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah

[09:05:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: like all those new issues?
[09:06:53] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: thanks for all the reviewing / tickets!

[09:08:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nice work

[09:08:54] <arschmitz> and either fixed or filed tickets

[09:27:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I now remember one other reason why I wasn't sure about using buttonMarkup for button elements, disabled doesn't work
[09:28:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: IE8 doesn't support :disabled selector so we can't handle with just CSS :(
[09:28:56] <arschmitz> stupid IE8
[09:30:07] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....the-github-game stalled at 634 commits...
[09:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> Time to play again! :-P
[09:30:29] <arschmitz> awwww
[09:30:48] <arschmitz> 755 now
[09:31:00] <arschmitz> oh but that includes the "first round"
[09:31:05] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:31:11] <scott_gonzalez> I restarted the script.
[09:31:17] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder how long it was sitting at 634.
[09:31:40] <arschmitz> well it seemed like it was doing 1 about every 2 seconds
[09:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I love how the --amend doesn't change the timestamp.
[09:32:16] <arschmitz> so thats ~1800 an hour
[09:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> We'll see how far I get this time.
[09:33:02] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:35:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: disabled button is fixable with CSS
[09:35:54] <uGoMobi> button[disabled]
[09:35:59] <arschmitz> oh nice
[09:37:11] <uGoMobi> just noticed that IE already greys out the text so when we add opacity we do things twice :/
[09:43:14] <scott_gonzalez> It always amazes me how much Twitter noise a simple article like http://designm.ag/tutorials/howto-build-range-slider-input-with-jqueryui/ can produce.
[09:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> And of course they're using a 1.8.16 theme with 1.10.3 JS :-/
[09:48:08] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i didnt read whole thing but it looks like pretty pointless
[09:48:31] <arschmitz> looks like you could have basicly copied everything there from the ui demos?
[09:48:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I just scrolled through and it's basically "You can use jQuery UI sliders."
[09:48:49] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:49:08] <arschmitz> its not even customized or anything
[09:50:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, when I first started scrolling through I at least expected it to be parsing the initial values from the HTML.
[09:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> Since they started with just markup.
[09:51:26] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah seems like a pointless article there is more covered and in a simple copy and paste fashion on http://jqueryui.com/slider/#range
[09:51:50] <arschmitz> all sorts of fun slider things there lol
[09:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:52:12] <scott_gonzalez> So sad
[09:52:32] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and anyone that would find that article usefull is just a copy & paster for sure

[10:21:07] <agcolom> yes, things move so quickly that these need to be looked v quickly... 
[10:21:19] <arschmitz> yeah well i have it down to 8 now

[11:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe one more round will get me to 5 digits...
[11:49:33] <godswearhats> Is this actually a bug? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6163
[11:49:36] <b-ot> godswearhats: Issue #6163 by gabrielschulhof (3w 2d ago): When enhancing an already-enhanced widget, _setOptions() must still be called, but it must do nothing
[11:49:48] <godswearhats> (I'm still working my way through all the Priority 4 issues with no owners)
[11:50:24] <godswearhats> Seems to be more a documentation problem?
[12:07:33] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15scottgonzalez opened pull request #1051: Dialog: Search the correct document for focus trapping. Fixes #9439 (06master...06dialog-document)  02http://git.io/PTyeNA
[12:14:01] * scott_gonzalez rolls his eyes every time he sees a problem from people calling _setOptions() on creation.
[12:19:23] <arschmitz> godswearhats: no that is about the internal code of the widget and is filed by a team member about a known potential issue in some of our widgets that needs to be looked at
[12:46:20] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15red2678 opened issue #6308: Panel Not Working After Page Change  02http://git.io/L-tWSw
[13:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I had the same thought about `.dialog( "instance" )` and almost made the change.
[13:08:51] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, since the line didn't change I can see leaving it. I think .dialog( "instance" ) is cleaner though.
[13:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's wrong though.
[13:10:00] <scott_gonzalez> See my comment.
[13:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like it's the right thing, but if it was, then there wouldn't be a variable in the first place.
[13:10:45] <tj_vantoll> Huh, GitHub only sent me one email (with the second comment).
[13:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[13:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> Though now that everything is in the right context, I can get rid of the variable.

[13:13:05] <tj_vantoll> Clever to store the count in $( document ).data() btw; I wouldn't have thought of that.
[13:13:29] <tj_vantoll> I still don't think I totally get why instance won't work here.
[13:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, at first I was going to use a hash, but didn't have anything to use as the key.

[13:18:30] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Do you have a minute to elaborate on why dialog( "instance" ) won't work? I'm not getting it.
[13:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> $.widget( "myns.mydialog", $.ui.dialog, { .. } )
[13:19:02] <scott_gonzalez> $( "<div>" ).mydialog()
[13:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> Now the ui.dialog code will run, but there is no .dialog( "instance" ), there's only .mydialog( "instance" )
[13:19:42] <tj_vantoll> AH
[13:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why we're using this.widgetFullName instead of hard-coding "ui-dialog"
[13:19:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's some tricky stuff.
[13:20:04] <tj_vantoll> I read that and somehow I missed it.
[13:20:08] <tj_vantoll> Thanks.
[13:20:19] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[13:22:07] <tj_vantoll> GitHub did email me btw. The second comment took a lot longer apparently.
[13:22:47] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe from my DDOS game :-P
[13:22:58] <arschmitz> ha ha
[13:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> Crap. It died again.
[13:23:12] <scott_gonzalez> So unreliable.
[13:23:30] <arschmitz> so close to 5 digits too!
[13:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> About a minute away :-)
[13:24:35] <arschmitz> so need a print screen of that before you delete repo
[13:26:24] <scott_gonzalez> 10,000!
[13:26:34] <arschmitz> HAZZA!
[13:29:33] <arschmitz> oh nice stopped it at exactly 10,000
[13:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm classy like that.
[13:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> 5x increase in commits for the year!
[13:31:06] <arschmitz> lol
[13:31:29] <asheppard> is there a global leaderboard somewhere or does this only show up on your profile?
[13:31:40] <scott_gonzalez> Just your profile.
[13:32:09] <asheppard> still, a noble accomplishment
[13:32:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats over 5X your commits to ui EVER lol
[13:32:41] <scott_gonzalez> HAHA
[13:33:08] <arschmitz> but with 0 lines added or removed lol
[13:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling this is actually a violation of their TOS.
[13:33:21] <arschmitz> probably
[13:34:50] <agcolom> hi!

[13:43:18] <scott_gonzalez> It was 10,000 empty commits :-P

[13:44:14] <scott_gonzalez> And the commit shows the time I started "playing".
[13:45:23] <agcolom> I thought you had restarted jquery ui from scratch or something like that... :-) but then there aren't that many commits there I think!
[13:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> 10,000 commits in one day is quite tiring. Time to make dinner :-P
