[04:49:23] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I am now.
[06:21:17] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: :P
[06:22:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hey it's cool to just deploy to stage when ever to share something right? i just don't want to overwrite something someone else might be looking at
[06:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, feel free to deploy to stage at any point.
[06:24:37] <scott_gonzalez> I had pushed something custom for the designers to look at, but it's already been overwritten :-P
[06:24:45] <kborchers> heh, ok
[06:25:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmm, i guess most of my changes are in web-base-template though so i guess there's more involved in staging that right?
[06:26:58] <scott_gonzalez> That *might* be auto-updating.
[06:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> If you don't see your changes up there, just let me know and I'll check the server.
[06:28:31] <kborchers> ok, i'll push. also, i didn't know kswedberg was working on design updates as well. had some conflicts to resolve and i'm seeing a weird duplication of one of my hr's that i have to figure out now but mostly it was ok
[06:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I didn't realize he was working on design either. Though I guess it should've been obvious when he was complaining about the CSS :-P
[06:29:46] <kborchers> true
[06:32:11] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] kborchers pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/rTYDKQ
[06:32:11] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Wrap entry body in a div for easier styling - Kris Borchers
[06:33:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: thoughts so far http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/disableSelection/
[06:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> Definitely a big improvement.
[06:35:02] <kswedberg> kborchers: looks great!
[06:35:17] <kborchers> thanks :) still quite a bit to do but getting better
[06:35:17] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/toggleClass/ has a lot more going on
[06:35:28] <kswedberg> I can hold off on design updates. I just saw a few things that were quick fixes while I was in there.
[06:35:59] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, what do you think about the layout on that page?
[06:37:49] <kborchers> something i just noticed if you shrink the window the "Returns:…" wraps badly so i'll have to fix that
[06:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> It looks good. I think if we get the styling for code blocks updated it's going to look really slick.
[06:39:26] <kborchers> yep, i was going to go there next i think
[06:39:27] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if there's an existing theme for the syntax highlighter we're using that looks better than what we have.
[06:39:44] <kborchers> i can take a look
[06:39:59] <kborchers> ok, i have to prep for a meeting but i should be working more tonight so hopefully will have more to show tomorrow
[07:01:25] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/AtFXLw
[07:01:25] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Created include for note about methods that override core methods. - Scott González
[07:09:16] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Any idea why api.jquery.com would look different than api.jqueryui.com if I just copied over the xsl?
[07:09:39] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like all the major changes were done in the base theme, so they should apply to both.
[07:09:43] <kborchers> hmmm, not sure. in a meeting i can look lagter
[07:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:47:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, i have a few minutes before next meeting. so what looks different? do you have it staged?
[07:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> No, but I can stage it.
[07:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> deploying now
[07:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jquery.com/addClass/
[07:50:04] <scott_gonzalez> compared to http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/addClass/
[07:50:37] <kborchers> hmm, maybe i need to clear cache, i don't see any change from a minute ago
[07:52:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: my guess is web-base-template is not automatically pulled down to api.jquery.com
[07:52:15] <kborchers> i don't see the styles i added
[07:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's a signle WordPress install.
[07:53:29] <kborchers> right, weird
[07:54:48] <kborchers> oh, my styles are there
[07:54:51] <kborchers> hmmm
[07:55:40] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: LOL
[07:55:59] <kborchers> i made these in the base.css but specific to UI until we liked them :)
[07:56:41] <kborchers> and since the XSL was different i thought i was only working on UI right?
[07:57:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I deployed with the same XSL to see it :-)
[07:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> So they're scoped to the site somehow?
[07:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> Even though they're in the base theme?
[07:58:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/2a2633c0228825efab1c2c10f2bb4018580f0009/themes/jquery/css/base.css#L2621
[07:58:38] <kborchers> there's lots of site specific stuff in that file
[07:59:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, interesting.
[07:59:08] <kborchers> probably need to break all of that out into the site specific themes
[07:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:59:20] <kborchers> i can work on that too if you want
[07:59:33] <kborchers> since i'm already making changes in there
[07:59:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm going to get the updated XSL into api.jquery.com and api.jquerymobile.com.
[07:59:42] <kborchers> gotta go to my next meeting
[07:59:50] <scott_gonzalez> That should make it easy for you to work on moving the styles around.
[07:59:58] <kborchers> sounds good
[08:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers kswedberg gnarf: We should create a category on the API site for methods that we override from core.
[08:55:26] <scott_gonzalez> Like .focus(), .addClass(), etc.
[08:55:32] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts on the name of the category?
[09:05:54] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - git core build #92: SUCCESS in 13 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/92/
[09:07:03] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: "override"
[09:11:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with that.
[09:13:52] <kborchers> override works for me
[09:36:50] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Am I reading the code wrong or do we have weird signatures for .show()/.hide()/.toggle()?
[09:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> They don't follow the common ( ..., duration, easing, complete )
[09:37:46] <scott_gonzalez> I realize this is my fault for not writing _normalizeArguments() correctly.
[09:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> You have to do .show( effect, { easing: ... }, duration )
[09:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> Luckily there are no strings after the effect name, so we should be able to fix this.
[09:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8527
[09:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: It's amazing how much more real this site feels with the style changes.
[09:52:24] <kborchers> :)
[09:59:43] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, the demos are broken in IE.
[09:59:57] <scott_gonzalez> "Object expected"
[10:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> weird, $ doesn't exist.
[10:07:49] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you should probably file a bug "jaqueries broked my site, you jerks!!"
[10:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> I can't figure out why jQuery isn't defined.
[10:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: .
[10:16:20] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: the demos broke in api.jquery.com if they had the double-slash style comments in them because IE collapsed lines
[10:16:27] <kswedberg> *new lines
[10:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> interesting
[10:17:02] <kswedberg> not sure if that's the same problem you're having
[10:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> Even something as simple as `alert( $ )` alerts undefined though.
[10:17:26] <kswedberg> oh weird. well, how much did you change that script?
[10:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> The script that creates the iframe?
[10:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> No tmuch.
[10:18:04] <kswedberg> yeah
[10:18:07] <kswedberg> ok
[10:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/8b9eb0097df46191cc7e1ae466df2f231a415dc9
[10:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> I did make this change: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/8b9eb0097df46191cc7e1ae466df2f231a415dc9#L0L187
[10:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> But I think we were just going through the undocumented API of .html() before that does the same thing.
[10:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> Since we obviously weren't relying on .innerHTML = <frame>
[10:20:59] <kswedberg> ah
[10:22:43] <scott_gonzalez> If you open http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/addClass/ (or any page with a demo), you'll get an error in IE8.
[10:22:55] <scott_gonzalez> I assume it's 6-8, but I haven't tested it.
[10:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> It does work in IE10.
[10:24:09] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...breaks in IE9 too.
[10:24:38] <kswedberg> crap.
[10:24:55] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: http://stage.api.jquery.com/css/ throws an error in Chrome.
[10:25:03] <kswedberg> related to demos. Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[10:25:34] <kswedberg> scripts.js:209
[10:50:23] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Got a question, somewhat controversial but its been bugging me (whether it is a matter of support or documentation).
[10:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[10:50:40] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: . Does jQuery officially support $( '<div>' ) or is it a side-effect of lazy-implementation for supporting <input> and <img> ?
[10:51:13] <Krinkle> related to $('<div class="foo">') correctly failing in IE
[10:51:19] <scott_gonzalez> I believe it's officially supported. DaveMethvin? ^
[10:51:27] <Krinkle> createElement vs parsing
[10:51:37] <Krinkle> The way I explain it is: use <tag> for creation and <valid>stuff</valid> for parsing.
[10:52:16] <Krinkle> And I'm doing that in MediaWiki, TestSwarm and I see that jQuery core also does that internally.
[10:52:40] <Krinkle> But not someone is calling me out on it when I documented in MediaWiki's code conventions, that it is a side-effect and we should all do $( '<div></div>' )
[10:53:14] <Krinkle> I can understand not liking <div/> because that is invalid HTML and isn't a plain tag. (e.g. that works as side-effect of unconditionally converting /> to ></tag>
[10:53:19] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle scott_gonzalez someone recently reported a bug with it so $('<div class="foo">') may be breaking but i have always advocated doing what Krinkle just said
[10:53:41] <Krinkle> So lets update the documentation to reflect that
[10:53:44] <DaveMethvin> we originally only supported shortcuts for plain tags with not attrs like <div />
[10:53:48] <Krinkle> It already says that for parsing it has to be valid XML.
[10:54:07] <DaveMethvin> yes it does and anyone who does that should always live a happy life
[10:54:12] <scott_gonzalez> It shouldn't have to be valid XML though.
[10:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> $( "<input type=text>" ) should work.
[10:54:28] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: there are only specific exceptions
[10:54:31] <Krinkle> no it should not
[10:54:40] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Why not?
[10:55:21] <Krinkle> anyway, it does not (it only works in Chrome/Firefox because innerHTML is lax in WebKit/Gecko)
[10:55:22] <Krinkle> Either way, that is a different discussion
[10:55:35] <Krinkle> I would like the documentation to say that for element creation (not parsing) <tag> is acceptable regardless of whether the element is a self-closing element.
[10:55:39] <scott_gonzalez> You can't do $( "<input>" ).prop( "type", ... ) in oldIE, right?
[10:55:42] <DaveMethvin> we only patch some single self-closed tags and don't try to make anything valid otherwise
[10:55:56] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: indeed, so do <input type=foo></input>
[10:56:05] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle that's not even valid.
[10:56:09] <Krinkle> Why not ?
[10:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> Do you mean <input type=foo/>?
[10:56:16] <Krinkle> yes, sorry
[10:56:27] <Krinkle> I mean, including the close / slash
[10:56:38] <scott_gonzalez> I should never have to write XML when working with an HTML document.
[10:57:06] <Krinkle> Anyway, my current point (I appreciate the other input) is that we should document that we allow <tag> regardless of whether the tag itself is one that cannot contain other elements.
[10:57:24] <Krinkle> We already support it because of the way quickTag  / doc.createElement works, but the docs don't reflect that yet.
[10:57:40] <Krinkle> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[10:57:47] <Krinkle> "To ensure cross-platform compatibility, the snippet must be well-formed. Tags that can contain other elements should be paired with a closing tag:"
[10:57:49] <Krinkle> that is fine
[10:58:08] <Krinkle> Then follows two sentences and samples that are somewhat confusing
[10:58:20] <Krinkle> $('<a/>');  and $('<img />'); $('<input>');
[10:59:16] <Krinkle> A sample with a wrong close tag (<a foo="bar"/>) is wrong imho, sure it works because of how we do /> -> ></tag> conversion, but I'd rather not have that in the docs.
[11:00:03] <kswedberg> Krinkle: I can remove that line and the example.
[11:00:21] <Krinkle> okay, then a few lines up it says:
[11:00:40] <Krinkle> "When the parameter has a single tag, such as $('<img />') or $('<a></a>'), jQuery creates the element using the native JavaScript createElement() function."
[11:01:36] <Krinkle> How about using as example: "such as $('<div>') or $('<a>') (closing tag, or quick-closing optional)"
[11:04:04] <kswedberg> sure
[11:05:20] <Krinkle> kswedberg: when you say "I can", do you mean, like, right now? Where are the docs maintained these days. I've been trying to find them.
[11:05:27] <Krinkle> We don't edit Wordpress anymore, right ?

[11:33:24] <kswedberg> Diffs aren't very helpful when you're writing prose. :/
[11:35:20] <Krinkle>  kswedberg btw, is there some kind of server-side / cdn cache?
[11:35:26] <Krinkle> I don't see the new version on api.jquery.com, only when I include a bogus query string like ?!23
[11:35:59] <kswedberg> Krinkle: yeah, it's cached. I don't dare clear the cache, because the server usually crumbles when that happens.
[11:36:13] <Krinkle> do you know how long until it is cleared?
[11:36:17] <nacin> gnarf: jquery-color.svn-names.js lists jquery.org, jquery-color.js lists jquery.com.
[11:43:20] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[11:51:11] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Yeah, on a call, but should be off soon.
[11:51:14] <scott_gonzalez> What's up?
[11:51:20] <kswedberg> k
[11:52:08] <kswedberg> This page gets janky when you click on an anchor or go straight to one: http://stage.api.jquery.com/css/#css1
[11:52:26] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: ↑ the header disappears
[11:53:05] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[11:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> There must be an overflow issue.
[12:04:25] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, Chrome dev is so busted
[12:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> I really need to switch to the stable channel.
[12:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: There's `overflow: hidden` on #body
[12:05:58] <scott_gonzalez> That's what causes the problem.
[12:06:28] <kswedberg> oh weird. I wonder if someone put that in there as a clearfix substitute.
[12:07:09] <kswedberg> I could work on fixing that, but I don't want to get up in kborchers's grill
[12:18:42] <kborchers> kswedberg: go ahead. seems silly to have an overflow hidden there. i'll just be sure to pull later before i work
[12:18:54] <kswedberg> k
[12:57:36] <kswedberg> kborchers: done. it was there to hide overflow of the sidebar. I rejiggered it so it wouldn't have to do it that way.
[12:57:51] <kborchers> kswedberg: sweet
[13:00:58] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you still messing with the XSL?
[13:01:25] <Krinkle> This is the first time I see the api.jquery stage. Very nice and compliments to everybody who worked on it!
[13:02:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: nvm, doesn't matter. i'll try to check in with you before i work later if you're still around. i just know some stuff i want to do will probably need xsl changes so don't want to step on toes
[13:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I don't anticipate any changes.
[13:14:53] <kborchers> ok, sounds good
[13:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> Don't worry about conflicts. I'll deal with them if they come up.
[13:15:01] <kborchers> ok
[13:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks Krinkle.
[13:35:37] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Pull api.jquery.com and see if the error for .css() is gone.
[13:38:59] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: looks like it's gone. thanks!

[13:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why that works on the old site but fails on the new site.
[13:39:28] <kswedberg> yeah, saw that. haha
[13:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> The new site holds us to higher standards :-P
[19:13:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: around?
[21:57:51] <kborchers> jzaefferer: thoughts on the red links/titles to break up all of that green http://cl.ly/image/2d1E1X213L0Z http://cl.ly/image/2U3k0Q3W0V0H http://cl.ly/image/0Y133i0A1q19  also, it looks like there are still some content/xsl issues and mismatches with the other sites causing weird layout things in that last image /cc scott_gonzalez
[22:02:15] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: also, i am still moving styles around into their themes and cleaning dupes, etc. but hope to finish that up tomorrow.
[23:52:01] <jzaefferer> kborchers: looks good to me
