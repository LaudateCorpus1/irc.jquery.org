[05:02:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6365 lead me to think that exposing _updateHeight() from js/widgets/forms/autogrow.js would be a good idea.
[05:02:48] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6365 by robcaldecott (1w 1d ago): Textarea autogrow height issue
[05:05:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That way, you could just $( "#my-popup" ).on( "popupbeforeposition", function() { $( "#textarea-inside-popup" ).textinput( "updateHeight" ); });
[05:06:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... whereas currently you have to $( "#textarea-inside-popup" ).data( "mobile-textinput" )._updateHeight();
[05:07:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno if it's too late to add an API.
[05:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: The proper method would be refresh().

[05:46:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[05:56:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I also suggested to arschmitz to expose _updateHeight
[05:56:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can add a call to autogrow refresh method
[05:58:03] <uGoMobi> a call to _updateHeight in the refresh method I mean

[08:15:45] <uGoMobi> gseguin: pong
[08:16:06] <gseguin> I found a way to automate the versions for the demos
[08:16:17] <uGoMobi> gseguin: great
[08:16:17] <gseguin> but it will work only for the ones in dist
[08:16:28] <gseguin> because it will happen at build time
[08:16:46] <gseguin> so we need to work with gnarf or someone else in infra
[08:17:16] <gseguin> to point view.jquerymobile.com/$version to $version/dist/demo
[08:17:28] <uGoMobi> gseguin: isn't that how it is now? only version in a build, otherwise "dev"
[08:17:31] <gseguin> or $version/dist/demos rather
[08:17:47] <gseguin> I don't think so
[08:18:47] <gseguin> if you go to http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/demos/ open a console and type `$.mobile.version` it returns dev
[08:18:59] <gseguin> so it's picking up the source environment

[08:49:25] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I filed an issue in infra to get a proxy set up, don't know how hard it is though
[08:51:12] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok , thanks
[08:51:55] <uGoMobi> gseguin: our demos are now on view.* but we are going to move them to jquerymobile.com/demos/
[08:52:27] <gseguin> that's ok, the proxy needs to happen anyway
[08:52:43] <uGoMobi> yeah, just so you know
[08:54:10] <uGoMobi> not sure if this means we have to manually upload the contents of /dist/ to jquerymobile.com/demos/[version]/
[08:54:45] <gseguin> oh wait, static demos you mean ?
[08:55:07] <gseguin> or will jquerymobile.com/demos be proxied to view.jquerymobile.com ?
[08:55:09] <uGoMobi> yeah, not the PHP stuff but the build
[08:55:58] <gseguin> why?
[08:56:25] <uGoMobi> because that's where it belongs
[08:56:38] <uGoMobi> also, we block view.* from search engines
[09:00:00] <gseguin> uGoMobi: but is it going to be hosted on jquerymobile.com or just proxied?
[09:00:41] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think on jquerymobile.com
[09:00:56] <gseguin> hmm... that doesn't make sense
[09:01:06] <uGoMobi> why not?
[09:01:11] <gseguin> who is doind the move ?
[09:01:15] <gseguin> doing
[09:01:26] <gseguin> because view.jquerymobile.com works
[09:01:38] <gseguin> there is no reason to move it
[09:02:57] <uGoMobi> the demos are part of our web site, while view.* is more meant for development
[09:03:32] <uGoMobi> so it does make sense to me to have the content on jquerymobile.com
[09:04:41] <uGoMobi> gseguin: this is also what gnarf suggested
[09:04:58] <uGoMobi> gseguin: let's discuss with the infra guys
[09:05:43] <gseguin> ok let's talk once they're online, maybe I misunderstand what's going on
[09:07:11] <gnarf> uGoMobi you could make the build process for jquerymobile.com do a pull of jquerymobile and build the demos that way too
[09:07:20] <gnarf> thats how jqueryui.com builds its demos i think
[09:07:21] <gnarf> cc scott_gonzalez 
[09:07:41] <uGoMobi> gnarf: that sounds like a nice solution
[09:07:58] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ^^
[09:08:36] <gseguin> gnarf: oh so we're stopping the view.* service ?
[09:08:54] <gnarf> gseguin not at all - view.* is meant as a developer resource, not a hosting solution for demos
[09:09:04] <gnarf> it's robots.txt blocks everything
[09:09:12] <gnarf> etc
[09:09:26] <gnarf> afk a bit
[09:09:30] <gseguin> so we'll technically have demos in 2 places
[09:09:58] <gseguin> which is fine with me but I want to make sure I understand 
[09:10:15] <gnarf> gseguin yes - the view.* should be basically raw.github.com but with the correct mime types and php
[09:10:22] <gnarf> it's just a view of the repo
[09:10:28] <gnarf> not meant to be a "public" server really
[09:10:39] <gnarf> useful for jsfiddles/etc
[09:12:27] <gseguin> gnarf: ok then you can close that ticket I just opened in infra
[09:13:08] <gseguin> is jquerymobile.com on github ?
[09:13:15] * gseguin is clueless
[09:13:18] <uGoMobi> gseguin: we won't need view.jquerymobile.com/[version]/demos/dist/ anymore
[09:13:36] <gseguin> that's right
[09:13:37] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes
[09:14:28] <gseguin> so part of the release script needs to add a demo folder to the jquerymobile repo
[09:14:41] <gseguin> do I have push access to jquerymobile.com repo?
[09:15:35] <uGoMobi> gseguin: we have to see how that works exactly with jquery-wp-content
[09:15:41] <gseguin> uGoMobi: whoever is in the release group should have push access to codeorigin and jquerymobile.com repos
[09:15:41] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com
[09:15:47] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content
[09:19:32] <uGoMobi> gseguin: the demos/ folder should already be there
[09:19:49] <uGoMobi> gseguin: demos/ should show demos of latest stable version
[09:20:10] <uGoMobi> gseguin: demos/[version]/ should show previous version
[09:22:00] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I don't see the demos folder in resources
[09:22:43] <uGoMobi> gseguin: sorry, I meant that the script doesn't need to add that folder
[09:22:49] <uGoMobi> we should create it
[09:22:58] <gseguin> oh yeah yeah
[09:23:06] <gseguin> ok
[09:23:23] <uGoMobi> we can look at how UI does this with their demos
[09:23:35] <gseguin> yeah will do
[09:55:04] <spilliams> I think I've found a bug in 1.10.3, I wanted a sanity check before reporting it formally
[09:56:50] <spilliams> The minified js file contains "+ ++a" which shortens to "+++a" in Mac/FF23, which consequently vomits. The non-minified corresponding sample is "+ (++uuid)". (1) I think it's strange the space is removed by Firefox (that's my hunch anyway), and (2) I think it's weird the minification of "+ (++uuid)" is "+ ++a" and not "+ (++a)"
[10:00:10] <spilliams> anyone have any insight?

[10:59:29] <kripper> Hi, I need some help here plz with JQM-dialogs-initialization.
[10:59:38] <kripper> I have an IFrame with a form inside a Dialog.
[10:59:45] <kripper> WORKS: Open Dialog, reload Iframe content, Close Dialog
[10:59:47] <kripper> DOESN'T WORK: Open Dialog, submit form inside the iframe, close the Dialog
[10:59:49] <kripper> any hint?
[11:00:19] <arschmitz> kripper: try #jquery for help and questions
[11:00:21] <kripper> is the form-submit doing something? what can I test from the console?
[11:00:29] <kripper> sorry
[11:00:29] <kripper> ok
[11:00:38] <kripper> thx
[11:03:44] <kripper> Hi, I need some help here plz with JQM-dialogs-initialization.
[11:03:47] <kripper> I have an IFrame with a form inside a Dialog.
[11:03:50] <kripper> WORKS: Open Dialog, reload Iframe content, Close Dialog
[11:03:50] <kripper> DOESN'T WORK: Open Dialog, submit form inside the iframe, close the Dialog
[11:03:53] <kripper> SYMPTOM: It seems like the IFrame inside the Dialog is reloaded when I try .dialog("close")
[11:03:55] <kripper> Any hint for debugging what's going on?
[11:39:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, do I have the go-ahead to make a refresh() method for textinput, which does nothing in the textinput plugin, but which is overridden in the autogrow plugin to call _updateHeight?
[11:45:38] <_|Nix|_> Argh ... you close one issue and two more open :/
[11:53:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the refresh method should only be in the autogrow extension if thats all its needed for
[12:02:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It is, but I'd like a refresh: $.noop in the textinput so if the extension is absent you don't get any errors.
[12:04:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm but i kinda this you should get an error there so you know something is wrong / the extension is missing. 
[12:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's not very auto if the user needs to call refresh :-P
[12:16:36] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: lol its just for in a popup because the textarea is hidden when its initalized so it gets an incorrect height
[12:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[12:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> I have an idea for this. I think.
[12:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see if I can find it.
[12:17:26] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: cool iv thought about a few different things for it but didnt like the solutions much
[12:17:39] <scott_gonzalez> No, I lied.
[12:17:44] <scott_gonzalez> There's no solution other than refresh().
[12:17:55] <arschmitz> ok
[12:18:26] <scott_gonzalez> I was thinking about the problem with nested stacking widgets.
[12:18:31] <scott_gonzalez> Like autocomplete inside a dialog.
[12:18:37] <arschmitz> ah ok
[12:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> But the autocomplete is initialized before the dialog.
[12:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> So it doesn't know that it should append itself to the dialog.
[12:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/415d8924ec9fa92b0a79
[12:20:10] <arschmitz> yeah the only way to handle this i know of is to like clone it and make it like position:aboslute top:-1000px visibility:hidden; get the height remove the clone and apply to original
[12:20:18] <arschmitz> so super ugly and not worth it 
[12:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> And potentially broken :-P
[12:21:04] <scott_gonzalez> There are several ways that cloning can fail.
[12:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> Absolute positioning changes flow, positional selectors won't work, etc.
[12:22:05] <arschmitz> yeah i know but even that aside i dont like the whole position off screen to calculate diminsions for hidden things concept
[12:22:48] <arschmitz> but its about the only way to do it i know about
[12:24:52] <arschmitz> anyway its flawed on multiple levels which is why its not done lol
[12:57:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll do it without the $.noop.
[13:01:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That was easy: refresh: function() { if ( this.options.autogrow ) { this._updateHeight(); } }
[13:02:05] <arschmitz> yup
[13:03:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, not so simple. I need to write the corresponding API doc :)
[13:05:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you mention popups in the documentation I think we should also mention panels
[13:05:31] <arschmitz> and collapsibles
[13:05:34] <uGoMobi> I suppose you will run into the same problem with those
[13:05:37] <uGoMobi> right
[13:05:57] <arschmitz> maybe just generalize as anything thats originally hidden
[13:06:21] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/509
[13:06:22] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #509 by gillespasse (33mon 1w ago): Textarea doesn't AutoGrow height with pre-filled values in a collapsible
[13:07:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah good idea, then we don't need to update (which we probably forget) when we add a new widget that initially hides stuff
[13:07:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "Mention"? That's an understatement. We need to fully document both.
[13:08:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: both?
[13:08:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You mean popups in conjunction with textinput?
[13:08:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you should just mention on autogrow that any time its initally hidden it will calculate incorrectly
[13:08:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm not going to mention in the API docs that one shout call refresh if the textinput is in a popup. That's, like, best practices, not API reference.
[13:08:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i meant
[13:08:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[13:09:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll put that in the refresh method docs.
[13:09:15] <arschmitz> so you will want to call refresh to update once its shown
[13:09:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: are we documenting extensions seperately from the base widget
[13:09:41] <arschmitz> seems like we should be if we are not
[13:09:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, that's an excellent question!
[13:10:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In a sense, an extension is a separate widget.
[13:10:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: AMD has implications on the API docs.
[13:10:28] <arschmitz> yes and it modifys the base widget in such that it changes the api
[13:11:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think for now I'll just write it in the main doc and I will write that the autogrow extension provides it.
[13:11:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean the refresh() method.
[13:11:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: this has much broader implications though we have many extensions
[13:11:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, it should be if ( this.options.autogrow && this.isTextArea )
[13:11:43] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: whats your take on this?
[13:11:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure.
[13:12:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Normally, if this was classical inheritance it would definitely be a different page, because it would be a subclass.
[13:13:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Too bad we can't document our API with specially formatted comments in our code - like Doxygen.
[13:16:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What say you? Refresh a text input. This method is provided by the autogrow extension, and it sets the height of the <code>textarea</code> element based on its contents. You should call this method when the <code>textarea</code> element becomes visible to make sure that its initial height matches its contents.
[13:18:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe "becomes visible" is confusing... they also become visible on "pageshow"
[13:19:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, what do you call a "shrink-wrapping" container?
[13:20:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That is, a container that is as small as possible, but still big enough for its contents to have the minimum size?
[13:20:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess that's what makes a popup different from a page, right?
[13:22:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, how come this problem doesn't happen on a page? After all, _updateHeight() is not called on a page either, so the initial height will be wrong there too.
[13:23:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wow! So it /is/ happening on pages too?
[13:23:59] <uGoMobi> maybe that is the issue here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6365#issuecomment-23541667
[13:23:59] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6365 by robcaldecott (1w 2d ago): Textarea autogrow height issue
[13:24:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just read that :)
[13:24:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... so, maybe refresh is not the way to go.
[13:24:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What about modifying autogrow to only ever, well, grow the textinput.
[13:25:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Never shrink.
[13:25:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats how it was in 1.3
[13:25:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually that is how it was
[13:25:27] <uGoMobi> but on request we added shrink
[13:25:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we could call refresh on pageshow
[13:25:51] <arschmitz> which i already had looked at doing actually
[13:26:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I smell a hack. How do you decide whether you need to call refresh?
[13:26:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, where would you put such code?
[13:26:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but it should also work correctly outside page
[13:26:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you dont you just always call it
[13:26:32] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[13:26:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: outside pages is always visible and you call it your slef
[13:26:46] <uGoMobi> but maybe then it's not an issue
[13:26:47] <arschmitz> self
[13:26:55] <uGoMobi> right
[13:27:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it would just be a binding done on create that any time pageshow is called on parent page refresh
[13:27:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec. Do you put something like $( document ).on( "pageshow", function( event ) { $( ":mobile-textinput", event.target ).textinput( "refresh" ); } );
[13:27:54] <_|Nix|_> ?
[13:28:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, on _create?
[13:28:08] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[13:28:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah and use _on
[13:29:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... is the page visible during pageshow. I mean visible in the sense that it's in the framebuffer, not in the sense that heights can be calculated?
[13:29:43] <arschmitz> heights can be calculated on pageshow
[13:29:51] <arschmitz> iv tried it already
[13:30:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but if it's already visible to the user, then changing heights may cause a snap right after the page shows up.
[13:30:54] <arschmitz> not a snap but a reflow yes
[13:31:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: With possibly visible consequences.
[13:31:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[13:31:39] <arschmitz> but its no different then anything else height cannot be calculated on things that are not visible
[13:31:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: With popup it's not an issue because during popupbeforeposition the popup's left/top is never-neverland.
[13:32:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in ui you can have reflows all over when initalizing widgets because everything is visible the whole time
[13:32:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about providing a shrink option and having it default to false?
[13:33:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think we would have to do another alpha if we add options and change defaults
[13:33:09] <arschmitz> thats a big api change
[13:33:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When did we commit to this auto-shrink?
[13:33:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do we have a published version that auto-shrinks?
[13:33:50] <arschmitz> no
[13:33:56] <arschmitz> it was a feature request
[13:34:01] <arschmitz> added in 1.4
[13:34:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so the API for this has not yet been established.
[13:34:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But OK, I see.
[13:34:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The alphas had unconditional auto-shrink.
[13:34:45] <arschmitz> yes
[13:34:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So we've kinda committed to that :/
[13:34:58] <arschmitz> yup
[13:35:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What if we auto-shrink if and only if we've previously expanded?
[13:35:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont think a reflow for this is a terrible thing
[13:35:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That would cause us to effectively ignore the initial typing.
[13:36:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont follow
[13:37:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: do you mean if we ignore shrink if not previously expanded?
[13:37:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes.
[13:38:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That would still give us autoshrink, but it would also allow us to embrace the textarea height given to us by the browser.
[13:38:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: personally i think that it should refresh on pageshow but do it with a css transition so its smooth
[13:39:00] <arschmitz> then it will just be the right height with out any special handeling
[13:39:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: didn't we remove the transition for a reason?
[13:39:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes because it caused problems while typeing
[13:39:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but if we only do it from create and not while typeing
[13:39:41] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:39:56] <arschmitz> so apply class with transition in create
[13:40:02] <arschmitz> and then remove after inital refresh
[13:40:21] <_|Nix|_> I won't object if we go that way, but I don't like changing heights when the page is already visible. I think it's not smooth that way.
[13:41:44] <uGoMobi> why do we set the height with JS on init? why not leave it to the CSS and only updateHeight if the textarea contains text?
[13:42:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree, if possible we should avoid that
[13:42:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we dont currently
[13:42:21] <arschmitz> but we need to if it contains text
[13:45:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ... that's an excellent point. However, one could also argue that, if the textarea initially contains text, then the dev should set a height via inline style so it looks good, and we'll take it from there.
[13:45:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's about how you wanna define autogrow. Is it a runtime behaviour or is it that, as well as a special initialization?
[13:45:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you really think we should advocate inline styles?
[13:46:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, but wait. What does the browser do if you simply specify a textarea with 15 paragraphs of lorem ipsum? Does it just create a dinky little thing that's of absolutely no use?
[13:47:19] <arschmitz> yup
[13:47:27] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ...
[13:48:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also in 1.3 a textarea would be the right height it it contained text
[13:48:05] <arschmitz> so it has to in 1.4 also
[13:48:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How did we achieve that in 1.3?
[13:48:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's that commitid that breaks it all?
[13:49:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think it's just one commit
[13:49:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: updated height on pagechange
[13:49:59] <uGoMobi> first we added autoshrink
[13:50:02] <arschmitz> so it always caused a reflow
[13:50:05] <arschmitz> this is not new
[13:50:12] <uGoMobi> then we merged this PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6294
[13:50:12] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Pull request #6294 by jhogervorst (3w 3d ago): Autogrow: adds padding omitted from clientHeight by Firefox
[13:50:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[13:51:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.3-stable/js/widgets/forms/textinput.js#L141
[13:51:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sounds like we need to go back to that.
[13:51:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes execpt we can use pageshow to do it a bit sooner i think
[13:52:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and bind directly to _updateHeight - no need to go through the delay.
[13:52:43] <arschmitz> yup
[13:53:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think we should add the transition back for this one special case of pageshow
[13:53:38] <arschmitz> so call _pageshowhandler which will add transtion class call update height then remove transtion class
[13:53:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What does that give us?
[13:54:01] <arschmitz> smoothness
[13:54:10] <arschmitz> in 1.3 it smoothly transitioned height
[13:54:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you remve the transition class before the transition completes, it will jerk to the final value, won't it?
[13:54:27] <arschmitz> in 1.4 we had to remove this because of adding auto shrink
[13:54:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes we would have to use an animation complete handler to remove
[13:54:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why? It should transition both ways ...
[13:55:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no it made a very bad experience
[13:55:31] <arschmitz> becuase you could stop long enough for transition to start then start typeing again
[13:55:38] <arschmitz> it was very bad
[13:56:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono. I don't mean tha the transition should always be on. I mean the transition should cause both a grow and a shrink upon pageshow.
[13:56:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or rather, we should handle both shrink and grow via transition upon pageshow.
[13:56:38] <arschmitz> yes there is no difference
[13:56:48] <arschmitz> we dont differentiate between the two
[13:57:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Good.
[13:57:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright, so, I guess, in that case we can skip the refresh method.
[13:57:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no
[13:57:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, we can't.
[13:57:34] <arschmitz> this wont fix popup collapsible
[13:57:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just realized it.
[13:57:37] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[13:57:38] <arschmitz> panel etc
[13:58:05] <_|Nix|_> The DOM really needs a "yo d00d, you're about to hit the glass" event.
[13:58:19] <arschmitz> lol
[13:58:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it would be to early lol
[13:58:44] <arschmitz> it cant calculate until it already hit
[13:58:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes it can - cmon - things are composited these days.
[13:59:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: While ( the f0rking page keeps changing ) { dontGoToGlass(); }
[13:59:36] <arschmitz> what we need is some magical way to calculate height of invisible things but its just not possible
[13:59:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I did exactly this with GTK.
[14:00:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I had a sizeRequest/sizeAllocate loop that happened several times before it converged.
[14:00:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The key is that it must converge, not that it should happen exactly once.
[14:01:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok well i gota head out right now feel free to ping me on anything else with autogrow ill check in later
[14:01:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll implement the pageshow thing.
[14:02:06] <arschmitz> sounds good
[14:02:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll use 1.3-stable as a (loose) reference.
[14:02:17] <arschmitz> very loose
[14:02:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll pay it homage.
[14:02:38] <arschmitz> lol
[14:19:47] <rpcesar> Is it possible to control whether or not a select-menu opens up in a popup or an overlay? I am having some massive issues in a large existing codebase, when using it as a menu and binding javascript to it, due to the fact that it may or may not require waiting around for a page transition.
[14:36:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What was the name of the class that added the transition to the textinput?
[15:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: My take on what? The docs?
[15:01:34] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, whether we should document extensions in separate files?
[15:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> Absolutely. But there's no support for it right now.
[15:03:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, what's wrong with just treating them as separate widgets, and then we add links between the pages?
[15:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...does a page render decently if you only have one option?
[15:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> Testing now.
[15:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> That's not too bad.
[15:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> We should add a new entry type for widget extension, but for the most part it can just use the existing widget templates.
