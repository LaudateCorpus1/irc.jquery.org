[05:23:26] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, gnarf, currently on deployment, a tag goes to production, right? So, it such commit doesn't need to be on master right? I can create a stable branch and the tag I create there goes to production. Does it sound correct?
[05:23:35] <rxaviers> if*
[05:24:07] <rxaviers> "So, the tagged commit doesn't"*
[05:26:42] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[05:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> You can tag from any branch.
[05:26:59] <rxaviers> I'm thinking of making a 1-9 branch on download builder for stable/production commits. This way, repo is free to use master for stage while having a clean stable branch separate. I think this approach is better than having prod and stage on master and sometimes having to revert stuff.
[05:27:03] <rxaviers> Cool!
[05:27:22] <scott_gonzalez> Seems good.
[05:27:34] <rxaviers> Perhaps we can do the same for jqueryui too
[05:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com should always be deployable from master.
[05:28:07] <scott_gonzalez> It is tough with download builder being a dependency though.
[05:28:27] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe gnarf has an idea for a better way to be able to test this.
[05:28:32] <rxaviers> ok
[05:28:37] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps a second staging environment.
[05:28:44] <scott_gonzalez> That runs off a different branch.

[06:37:35] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: just updated the grunt-0-4 branch. Now compatible with 0.4rc5, including updates to grunt-css and grunt-html plugins. That took way longer than I hoped for :/
[06:39:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll check it out next week.
[06:42:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez gnarf mikesherov: I just changed the build triggers for the 1-9 stable jobs on Jenkins. Except for the core-git job, they are only triggered by changes to the main 1-9-stable job. core-git is built after the main job or 1.x core is built. Should reduce TestSwarm load a lot, since we don't need to build those four jobs each day.
[06:42:48] <scott_gonzalez> Good idea.
[06:43:39] <jzaefferer> I'm fed up with waiting several hours for one QUnit job to run after a commit :/
[06:51:41] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez We should have a place to document things the widgets do not support.  I didn't know about the change event (https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/63) and I also didn't know about cloning not being supported.
[06:52:09] <tj_vantoll> Maybe a bulleted list here http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/.
[06:52:40] <scott_gonzalez> We need an updated http://docs.jquery.com/Won%27t_Fix

[06:55:13] <scott_gonzalez> contribute?
[06:55:20] <ajpiano> it's in contribute already
[06:55:23] <ajpiano> just not linked
[06:55:58] <ajpiano> wasn't quite sure where to put it, doesn't quite feel like it belongs in the header
[06:57:05] <tj_vantoll> Does it make sense to have a jQuery UI section at the bottom of that page?
[06:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I want to have a UI section on it. I've just been waiting for the new page.
[06:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> So if it's already in contribute, we can start adding to it.
[06:59:46] <scott_gonzalez> Because everything on the core page applies to UI as well.

[07:03:17] <tj_vantoll> Makes sense.  I can add a pull with the change event and cloning later tonight if you'd like.
[07:03:42] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be great.
[07:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> I think CSS transforms are in the list as well.
[07:04:03] <scott_gonzalez> Presumably that's a core thing though.
[07:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6844#comment:18
[07:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> Transforms make things like .position() useless.
[07:05:52] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, .width() and .height and such get a little weird as well, and animations, etcâ€¦

[09:04:11] <rxaviers> holy cow, Im spending too much time Im something... I will post it here wonderin if someone by chance know what's going on.
[09:04:26] <rxaviers> I want to colorize icons, using gm
[09:04:39] <rxaviers> gm(256, 240, '#ffff00').mask('icons.png').write('output.png', function(err){if(err) console.log(err);});
[09:05:09] <rxaviers> icons.png is the mask. 256 is mask width, 240 is mask height
[09:05:31] <jzaefferer> hey rxaviers
[09:05:40] <rxaviers> I get a full yellow background square, it seems mask had no effect
[09:05:44] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, hello!
[09:06:02] <rxaviers> wondering*
[09:06:53] <rxaviers> (get a copy of icons.png at https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/967155/53440/c741d848-5a65-11e2-83aa-9a630792e4aa.png)
[09:08:06] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what's the input?
[09:08:26] <jzaefferer> are you trying to mask a yellow square?
[09:08:39] <rxaviers> I'd like to produce yellow icons
[09:08:48] <jzaefferer> is that the same approach that old TR is using? 
[09:08:56] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:09:05] <rxaviers> old TR approach https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/77
[09:09:57] <rxaviers> ah, before the mask it rdc (reduce color depth)
[09:10:01] <rxaviers> let me check that
[09:10:07] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:10:29] <jzaefferer> also, maybe try with command line GM? Or even IM?
[09:10:44] <jzaefferer> to see if you can reproduce the old behavior without PHP first

[09:17:44] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I took the icons.png mask from old themeRoller
[09:17:56] <rxaviers> Im trying to mimic the arguments it passes to phpthumb
[09:18:00] <rxaviers> the closest I got is
[09:18:01] <rxaviers> gm(256, 240, '#ffff00').bitdepth(16).mask('icons.png').write('output.png', function(err){if(err) console.log(err);});
[09:18:14] <rxaviers> closest*
[09:18:40] <rxaviers> it seems mask did not take effect
[09:19:14] <rxaviers> and still does not after the bitmask
[09:20:01] <rxaviers> rcd is a phpthumb wrapper, not a image magick built in thing.
[09:20:09] <rxaviers> the bitmask was the closest I got to
[09:21:24] <rxaviers> but, anyway I could not make mask to work yet. http://www.graphicsmagick.org/GraphicsMagick.html#details-mask says how it works

[10:48:08] <rxaviers> have played before*
[12:43:21] <therealklanni> Does jQuery 1.8 still only use "success", "error" and "complete" for the _property name_ in the options object of an $.ajax object? I know the fluent interface is being deprecated in favor of "done"/"fail"/"always" but is that naming convention carrying over to the options object as well?
[12:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> therealklanni: You probably want to ask that in #jquery-dev.
[12:48:01] <therealklanni> I did
[12:48:09] <therealklanni> Oh oops
