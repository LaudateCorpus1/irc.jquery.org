[13:42:43] <dpamio> Hi
[13:43:43] <dpamio> I've a question regarding documentation: IÂ´m about to write a new jQuery UI widget with the widget factory, and I need something to generate a documentation of the widget for my "users"
[13:44:09] <dpamio> Can I get something similar to the standard jQuery UI widgets documentation?
[13:44:51] <dpamio> Or can someone tell me what was used to generate this page: http://addyosmani.github.io/jquery-ui-bootstrap/ ?
