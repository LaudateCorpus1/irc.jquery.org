[06:04:20] <ajpiano> what is going on here, lol http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions cc jzaefferer
[06:11:03] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: That's because someone (gnarf?) replaced some old files that had disappeared with new UI files.
[06:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> And the theming got all screwed up.
[06:11:25] <ajpiano> ah
[06:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> docs is such a mess.
[06:11:29] <ajpiano> yeah
[06:11:45] <ajpiano> docs.jquery.com/Tutorials is db erroring too
[06:35:02] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to 1-8: http://git.io/8jMOZA
[06:35:02] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/1-8] Removed .uniqueId() and .removeUniqueId(). - Scott González
[07:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Thoughts on this http://cl.ly/image/2y16282z1w1P instead of http://cl.ly/image/2c1y3s2T080S ?
[07:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> Just the text, not the styling.
[07:23:10] <scott_gonzalez> I noticed that right now there's no support for deprecated/removed at the signature level.
[07:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> Rather than writing two separate templates, I'd like to just reuse the template for adding the info to the description of a property/argument.
[07:24:15] <kswedberg> yeah, we should have it at the signature level too. thx.
[07:25:02] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I'm not a fan of putting them both in parens
[07:25:57] <kswedberg> I'd rather see: version added: 1.0, deprecated: 1.9
[07:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I did that because it's easier than writing conditionals in XSL
[07:26:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'll update it for that output, it's just going to be some ugly if statements :-P
[07:26:51] <kswedberg> lol.
[07:27:17] <kswedberg> sorry!
[07:27:23] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want the parens around the whole thing when it appears at the end of a property/argument description?
[07:27:51] <kswedberg> yes
[07:28:15] <kswedberg> I think so. what do you think?
[07:28:41] <kswedberg> makes more sense there at the end of a bunch of other text.
[07:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:29:51] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: another thing we could do that wouldn't involve ugly if statements would be to put each in a div and float: right; clear: right;
[07:30:08] <kswedberg> so each is on its own line
[07:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I know I got the version info in parens at the end of the description from an existing entry in api.jquery.com, but apparently there was proper support for this already: http://cl.ly/image/2i441Q2K1z3I
[07:30:50] <scott_gonzalez> The top is the new site, the bottom is the old site.
[07:31:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember which entry I was looking at when I saw the info at the end on the old iste.
[07:31:35] <kswedberg> I guess we weren't very consistent, huh?
[07:31:39] <kswedberg> Which do you prefer?
[07:31:51] <kswedberg> I could go either way.
[07:31:52] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, specialEasing on http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[07:32:19] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe because that was a property inside an argument?
[07:32:30] <kswedberg> btw, I want to add another option to animate: quantitativeEasing
[07:33:03] <kswedberg> maybe so
[07:34:11] <scott_gonzalez> There's already a lot of info in arguments/properties, so keeping version info at the end seems good.
[07:35:14] <kswedberg> cool.
[07:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: http://cl.ly/image/0D27343A3N3P
[07:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1Z2w0w3w2j2Y
[07:56:23] <kswedberg> looks good to me!
[07:56:43] <scott_gonzalez> I think I might bold the text in when it's at the top level too.
[07:57:31] <kswedberg> ok.
[08:02:35] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/Goyngg
[08:02:35] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Added version info for .uniqueId() and .removeUniqueId(). - Scott González
[08:02:35] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Fixed version info for .disableSelection() and .enableSelection(). - Scott González
[08:12:18] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: When you get a chance can you do a grunt-jquery-content release? Just bump the patch version.
[10:49:39] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/IPGkzQ
[10:49:39] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Updated version info for .enableSelection() and .disableSelection(). - Scott González
[10:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers gnarf: There's still some work that could be done on the blog design, but I'm good releasing with what's on stage.blog.jqueryui.com. If anyone has strong feelings about any changes, you might want to get them in soon.
[10:58:37] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: how soon is soon? i see some style tweaks i would like to make
[10:58:50] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Before 1.9 release.
[10:59:20] <kborchers> have we set a hard date for that yet?
[10:59:49] <scott_gonzalez> No, but we're really close now.
[10:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0_zCSCATeXQJG6ULC0ELl5Pt4CK33a7X2ku78ylCsA/edit?pli=1#
[11:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: How's the demo testing going?
[11:01:04] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, hope to finish my visual test/demo review and maybe those style tweaks tomorrow night (have family coming over tonight)
[11:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[11:01:50] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: would be nice to add tentative dates to the roadmap unless you don't like time boxing yourself :)
[11:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers and jzaefferer are working on getting the theme generation into jquery-ui grunt.
[11:02:08] <kborchers> cool
[11:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> It seemed to be working at the end of the week, but I haven't seen it merged into master yet.
[11:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> Once that lands, I can finish the release script.
[11:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf nacin: I'd like to work on api.jqueryui.com/1.8 now.
[11:02:56] <rxaviers> yeap, had a gap between weekened and now. Back to work now
[11:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I should be able to just add it to domains.php and it'll work?
[11:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> The order matters, right? I have to add it to the end of the array?
[11:05:04] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I'll test it out.
[11:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks nacin
[11:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Ugh, I just merged that PR into master instead of themeroller.
[11:11:11] <rxaviers> oh oh
[11:11:20] <rxaviers> shall revert?
[11:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'll revert that.
[11:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> I just merged into themeroller.
[11:11:40] <rxaviers> thks
[11:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> fixed
[11:11:59] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/b4wu9Q
[11:11:59] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Revert "Update download.jqueryui.com frontend objects" - Scott González
[11:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: And more importantly, you now have commit access on that repo.
[11:12:58] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ah! ok thks
[11:13:03] <scott_gonzalez> I should have just done that first, then I wouldn't have screwed up the merge :-P
[11:13:13] <rxaviers> hehe
[11:13:59] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, you around?
[11:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: jqueryui.com won't deploy from master.
[11:34:44] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, pardom? need a bit more detail
[11:34:56] <rxaviers> anything broken?
[11:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/3744920
[11:35:47] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like it might be related to that PR. Were there changes in download.jqueryui.com master?
[11:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...doesn't look like it.
[11:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, it's from https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/commit/f9bea2a0c468357330108e737ebde3f720f7d2d1
[11:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe jzaefferer was linking to a branch locally.
[11:36:55] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, that's still from themeroller branch
[11:37:10] <rxaviers> let me double check
[11:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> That commit is in jqueryui.com master
[11:37:26] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe he didn't realize which branch he was in.
[11:38:16] <rxaviers> download.themeroller requires themeroller to be implemented on download.jqueryui.com side
[11:38:42] <scott_gonzalez> I just did a checkout of the commit before that and it's working.
[11:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to revert that commit.
[11:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> My guess is that he wanted that in a branch on jqueryui.com.
[11:41:04] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, themeroller branch has two commits: a68c509 and f9bea2a
[11:41:25] <rxaviers> I saw you reverted the first one only. That's right, we need to rever the second (f9bea2a) as well
[11:41:41] <rxaviers> revert*
[11:42:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've got that reverted locally.
[11:42:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'll push that up.
[11:42:51] <rxaviers> we can't go back in the commit and force push it, can we? (not a good practice, but that would clean it up hehe)
[11:43:48] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/-wTIqA
[11:43:48] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Revert "Generate themeroller.html. Introduces an option to skip the prepare task, useful while testing" - Scott González

[13:21:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it deploys to stage from master
[13:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What does?
[13:22:08] <gnarf> jqueryui.com
[13:22:09] <gnarf> right?
[13:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:22:32] <gnarf> or did you mean it actually isn't deploying because of a grunt deploy issue?
[13:23:08] <scott_gonzalez> There was a problem in the gruntfile. rxaviers and I tracked it down.
[13:23:15] <scott_gonzalez> Some code got into master too early.
[13:23:24] <gnarf> aha
[13:23:36] <gnarf> just read that wrong
[13:23:39] <gnarf> nevermind me
[13:23:46] <gnarf> stressful day
[13:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> We need to ship 1.9 so some of my stress can go away.
