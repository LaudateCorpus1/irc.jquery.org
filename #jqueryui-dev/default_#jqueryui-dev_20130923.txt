[02:10:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey!
[02:10:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's fine, about the API docs. Gives me more time to work on them.
[02:11:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[02:11:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Shouldn't the fact that we're deprecating buttonMarkup be reflected in the demos? Like <a href="#" class="ui-btn ui-btn-inline">Button</a> etc.?
[02:12:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, we should use the recommended markup in our demos
[02:12:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, are you merging the demos-update branch before 1.4.0-beta.1?
[02:12:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[02:12:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[02:12:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: *whew* ... so much deprecation to deal with.
[02:12:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there will be things to work on
[02:12:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's an understatement :)
[02:12:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lol
[02:14:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when you look at the panel entry in the API docs 1-4 branch, what JQM version are the examples in the iframes using?
[02:17:22] <_|Nix|_> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.css
[02:17:28] <_|Nix|_> ... so that may well be 1.3
[02:17:39] <_|Nix|_> I'll replace that to be the same as all the other examples.
[02:18:27] <_|Nix|_> OK, there are several examples under resources that use that path. I'll change them.
[02:18:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great, thanks!
[02:20:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: BTW I can reproduce the double vertical scrollbar issue
[02:20:46] <uGoMobi> ^^ agcolom
[02:20:57] <uGoMobi> will look into that later this week

[02:49:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the buttonMarkup method has the button element in the init selector. I think we should change that to button:not(.ui-btn) to prevent initialization when you add classes yourself
[02:51:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's first check what happens if you do both. 
[02:51:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I can test that now
[02:53:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... Ummm ... OK ... enhanceWithButtonMarkup is gone!
[02:53:30] <_|Nix|_> WTF?!
[02:53:34] <uGoMobi> :/
[02:55:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when I add class ui-btn to a button element it doesn't add classes for defaults like ui-corner-all which is good 
[02:55:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we do add role="button" though which seems superfluous
[02:55:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, it's good because enhanceWithButtonMarkup is missing ...
[02:55:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, that's not superfluous - it's an ARIA attribute.
[02:56:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There was a bug about that.
[02:56:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for a button element?
[02:56:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, that's right ... I guess you only need that for links.
[02:56:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yup
[02:56:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I made the code add it unconditionally.
[02:56:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lemme check the code ...
[02:56:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[02:57:37] <_|Nix|_> OK ... buttons get autoenhanced, but from where, I have no idea.
[02:58:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the initSelector?
[02:59:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was just thinking we don't have to run buttonMarkup code if a button element already have the classes so changing the initSelector to button:not(.ui-btn) improves performance
[02:59:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We already gave code like that. The selector is unnecessary. I just need to figure out where.
[03:00:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok

[03:06:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, thanks for looking into it
[03:07:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If class ui-btn is absent, it applies defaults. Otherwise, it doesn't do anything.

[04:57:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll go over the options I just deprecated and then I'll update the demos to not use them.

[05:15:40] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi closed issue #6501: The default theme is too monochromatic  02http://git.io/-VX9AA
[05:19:21] <_|Nix|_> OK ... it's not that simple. You cannot add  data-wrapper-class="ui-btn-icon-right", because the widget adds ui-btn-icon-left by default.
[05:19:32] <_|Nix|_> Argh ...
[05:20:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am working on input button demo page
[05:20:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I split up the buttons page into one for anchors and button elements, and one for input buttons
[05:20:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry! I was talking about checkboxradio.
[05:21:26] <uGoMobi> ah ok, I was so into input buttons that I forgot there are other inputs for a moment ;-)
[05:21:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but you're right that it aint easy
[05:22:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It was easier to mark as deprecated :)
[05:22:25] <uGoMobi> I am gonna show input buttons enhanced examples
[05:25:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: morning
[05:25:19] <uGoMobi> because data-wrapper-classes for style classes is causing too much issues as long as we have the style options in the widget
[05:25:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: morning
[05:25:53] <uGoMobi> this is actually why I wasn't sure if we should do this last minute
[05:27:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the missing comments on github issue is because i deleted realized i changed the wrong file and comment was no longer valid
[05:27:12] <_|Nix|_> Argh ... we're calling _setOptions() from _create in checkboxradio.
[05:27:37] <_|Nix|_> So, if I add ui-mini to wrapperClass, it gets removed because o.mini === false ...
[05:27:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, np
[05:27:54] <_|Nix|_> My first reaction is to roll back these deprecations.
[05:28:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: already thought that was the case but wanted to double check
[05:28:16] <_|Nix|_> We need to work though these.
[05:28:55] <_|Nix|_> s/though/through/
[05:29:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: have you tried doing it as "enhanced" like uGoMobi?
[05:30:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It will work if I also use data-enhanced="true", but it won't work on its own.
[05:30:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right there is essentially no way to avoid that
[05:30:43] <arschmitz> regardless of set options
[05:30:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but then we can't deprecate the option.
[05:30:55] <uGoMobi> yeah, it's not really the correct way of deprecating the style option
[05:31:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: how would you do it otherwise?
[05:31:21] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#830 (master - a9a42e9 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build passed.
[05:31:21] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/93d1b74bcb98...a9a42e971a43
[05:31:21] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/11685460
[05:31:24] <arschmitz> it would be way to much overhead to check if any possible conflicting class already exists
[05:31:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... initialize the option from _create based on whether the class is present?
[05:31:43] <uGoMobi> we would have to add a check if wrapperClasses is used to add style classes or something
[05:31:57] <uGoMobi> right, not ideal either
[05:32:04] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ...
[05:32:11] <arschmitz> there is no good way to make it work both ways at same time
[05:32:26] <arschmitz> they conflict in a fundamental way 
[05:32:42] <_|Nix|_> OK, so we keep the deprecation, and we indicate that, /as of 1.5.0/ you add the classes.
[05:32:54] <_|Nix|_> But for now, you set the option.
[05:32:56] <arschmitz> so it does not matterif we do it now or in 2 versions the same issue will exist
[05:33:17] <uGoMobi> how about changing the defaults for the style options
[05:33:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: in what way?
[05:33:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Doesn't matter. The value of the option does not agree with the effect of the value: mini = false, but the class is present.
[05:33:51] <uGoMobi> if you set the style options to null
[05:34:07] <arschmitz> then what happens if you want to use it normally?
[05:34:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[05:34:33] <_|Nix|_> I think it's enough to inform users of an upcoming change.
[05:34:40] <_|Nix|_> Since we can't make both work side-by-side.
[05:34:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: one thing that could be done though kinda weird
[05:35:27] <arschmitz> would be to make a backcompat file that just changes the values of the options to their 1.3 values if included and set them all to null in the actual widgets
[05:35:52] <arschmitz> so file is there it handles style options like normal
[05:36:03] <arschmitz> if its not there you dont get the class conflict
[05:36:14] <uGoMobi> not a bad idea
[05:36:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: or we just document that you have to configure the default
[05:36:46] <uGoMobi> if you add classes yourself
[05:36:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We already have a backcompat for filter. We can add that to a "global" backcompat file.
[05:37:15] <arschmitz> either way is fine with me
[05:37:30] <_|Nix|_> Well, currently for data-enhanced="true" you have to also specify the option value because of this very issue.
[05:37:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we should not combine them
[05:37:34] <arschmitz> i think as long as we are clear with the change i think its fine
[05:37:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Why not - then we just slash the whole thing to get rid of backcompat.
[05:38:17] <arschmitz> i think being clear in blog and docs is the most important thing with any of the solutions
[05:38:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but when I only use checkbox I will get a huge backcompat file
[05:38:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah true
[05:38:43] <_|Nix|_> Agreed. uGoMobi Right. True.
[05:39:00] <_|Nix|_> We could make a backcompat directory in the repo.
[05:39:13] <_|Nix|_> BBIAB. Lunch.
[05:39:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah that sound good
[05:39:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: enjoy your lunch

[05:44:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you have write access to that doc
[06:13:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Must be my Intel account.
[06:13:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its anyone i made it world writeable
[06:18:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I updated it with what I've done.
[06:19:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so bad ios 7 news
[06:19:34] <arschmitz> ios7 homescreen apps dont have a history object after the first time they open
[06:19:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Argh!
[06:19:54] <arschmitz> so back buttons dont work now
[06:21:04] <_|Nix|_> Like, no window.history?
[06:21:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats what it seems like
[06:21:20] <_|Nix|_> *facepalm*
[06:21:21] <arschmitz> im still looking into it 
[06:21:41] <arschmitz> but history.back() seems to not work
[06:22:01] <arschmitz> and from what im reading thats the cause
[06:22:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, Undefined reference? I'm assuming so if the whole object is missing.
[06:22:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they also no longer support alert messages making them hard to debug
[06:23:16] <_|Nix|_> fscking Apple ... the only way to debug is to buy a mac :( ... That's why I'll /never/ buy anything from them.
[06:23:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also webapps can open links in safari any more
[06:24:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: " If you are using Application Cache and also managing states through hash or other technique, the history object will not keep your navigation history, therefore history.back() will never work and history.length stays in 1 forever"
[06:24:27] <arschmitz> so its only with app cache but still
[06:24:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so, it's like enableHashChange = false
[06:25:10] <arschmitz> essentially yeah
[06:25:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: didnt we already talk about adding a back method to deal with this case?
[06:25:37] <arschmitz> and use our internal history object?
[06:25:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking we should provide both a $.mobile.back and $.mobile.forward which takes into account whether changeHash was on or not, and affects browser history iff the changeHash in the urlHistory entry was true.
[06:26:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats what i was thinking of
[06:26:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: $.mobile.back is not for that. Only for phonegap.
[06:26:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's not done yet.
[06:26:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right i know 
[06:26:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i meant that we talked about adding a method that WOULD deal with this case
[06:26:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, might be high time :/
[06:26:48] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:26:59] <arschmitz> dont see it for 1.4 though maybe for 1.4.1
[06:27:06] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[06:27:12] <_|Nix|_> To fix iOS7.
[06:27:17] <arschmitz> yup
[06:27:23] <uGoMobi> sounds like a new feature though
[06:27:34] <uGoMobi> not sure if we can land that in a maintenance release
[06:27:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, "fix iOS7" can also sound like a bug.
[06:28:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We'd be implementing a bugfix with an eye towards a clean future-proof implementation.
[06:28:23] <uGoMobi> yeah, the never ending discussion of hat is a bug fix and what is a new feature
[06:28:34] <uGoMobi> s/hat/what/
[06:28:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah this is totally a bug fixs every homescreen app people use jqm for is busted on ios7
[06:28:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We already have a don't-use-browser-history feature.
[06:29:07] <_|Nix|_> This would turn it on by default for iOS7.
[06:29:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: would probably just end up turning on for all homescreen apps there is a prop you can check to see if your in a ios homescreen app
[06:30:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, since those don't have a back button anyway ...
[06:30:24] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:30:28] <uGoMobi> how about adding it after 1.4 beta 1
[06:30:41] <uGoMobi> and if we feel it's necessary we do a beta 2
[06:30:43] <_|Nix|_> I feel like Atlas ...
[06:30:50] <arschmitz> lol
[06:31:03] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:31:03] <_|Nix|_> ... when a comet impacts the Earth.
[06:32:55] <arschmitz> on the bright side of ios7 the claim of double the speed holds true for js execution too!
[06:33:09] <arschmitz> actually slightly better then double
[06:33:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... just when we reduced the amount we rely on JS :)
[06:33:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its approching desktop chrome
[06:33:47] <_|Nix|_> Nice!
[06:34:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its sunspider is 455
[06:34:21] <arschmitz> chrome is 198
[06:34:29] <arschmitz> ios5 is 910
[06:34:46] <arschmitz> s4 which wasthe current leader is 908
[06:36:56] <_|Nix|_> ... not that this should encourage us to lean on JS any more than we already are.
[06:38:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nope but its still good
[07:22:29] <jzaefferer> kborchers scott_gonzalez: I've started looking at the pointerevents polyfill, trying to make sense of it all for now
[07:23:44] <kborchers> jzaefferer: cool, i would definitely appreciate help on that … feel a bit overwhelmed and buried trying to track down issues in IE6 and 7
[07:24:54] <jzaefferer> kborchers: this PR is weird. I guess the PR author wasn't allowed to sign the corporate CLA? https://github.com/Polymer/PointerEvents/pull/94
[07:24:54] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Pull request #94 by sgrebnov (1mon 2w ago): allows polyfill to be installed at 'interactive' document ready state
[07:25:01] <jzaefferer> kborchers: you signed the individual CLA, right?
[07:25:07] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yes
[07:26:52] <jzaefferer> kborchers: do you have a hint for me why the tests fail?
[07:27:06] <jzaefferer> "AssertionError: expected [Function] to equal 0" is not super helpful
[07:27:19] <jzaefferer> though I guess that's caused by your "make size a function" change
[07:27:32] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15miguelsan opened issue #6502: Customize text of a close button in a multiple select  02http://git.io/P8WiLA
[07:27:58] <jzaefferer> QUnit has better stack traces :/
[07:28:05] <kborchers> jzaefferer: exactly … that was the comment i made (somewhere) about them testing for things that i specifically changed to the opposite of what they wanted to make them work in old IE like size needing to be a function
[07:29:59] <jzaefferer> that might be the only change though
[07:30:27] <jzaefferer> do you want to give me write access to your fork? Or should I fork it to jquery?
[07:30:54] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: do we want a fork of Polymer/PointerEvents at jquery/PointerEvents?
[07:31:05] <jzaefferer> Or should we keep it on our own accounts?
[07:31:14] <kborchers> jzaefferer: maybe … tbh i was mostly just testing visually while i was hacking on IE … the plan was to get things "working" then modify and add tests to make sure they were really working
[07:31:30] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i can give you write access or fork to jquery. i'm fine either way. what ever scott_gonzalez says
[07:34:37] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I can commit to your fork for now
[07:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> Probably keep it in individual forks.
[07:34:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure we want forks in the jquery account.
[07:35:06] <kborchers> jzaefferer: orealy?
[07:40:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: http://jsbin.com/upirol/70/edit when you use enhanced true for input buttons you have to add the text (input value) yourself as well
[07:40:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes because that is dom manip
[07:41:09] <arschmitz> and the whole point of "enhanced" is zero dom manip
[07:41:58] <jzaefferer> kborchers: that is, can you give me access to your fork?
[07:41:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, I wasn't sure if it was intentional
[07:42:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup it is
[07:43:25] <kborchers> jzaefferer: oh gotcha … yep one sec
[07:44:08] <kborchers> jzaefferer: should have access now
[07:45:03] <jzaefferer> yep, works. First commit: https://github.com/kborchers/PointerEvents/commits/oldIE
[07:51:09] <kborchers> nice :)
[07:52:32] <jzaefferer> kborchers: so chai supports IE9+ :/
[07:52:49] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i just added issues to the repo to if you want to add stuff there as you come across them. then we won't be stepping on each other's toes working on stuff
[07:52:58] <jzaefferer> in other words, unit tests fail to run in anything below that just because the test runner doesn't work
[07:53:23] <kborchers> jzaefferer: hadn't gotten that far but kind of figured we might to do a lot to the tests, possibly rewriting in something else which would be a pain :(
[07:56:12] <jzaefferer> I've logged that as an issue for now: https://github.com/kborchers/PointerEvents/issues/1
[07:56:12] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #1 by jzaefferer (8s ago): Unit tests fail in anything below IE9
[07:59:19] <jzaefferer> trying to load samples/paint fails as the polymer loader assumes Array.prototype.forEach to exist...
[07:59:46] <kborchers> jzaefferer: welcome to my hell
[08:03:25] <jzaefferer> all that document.write crap is terrible, makes IE's error messages a PITA
[08:04:30] <kborchers> yep, Error on line 1893 of index.html when index.html has 300 lines or something like that :/
[08:05:36] <jzaefferer> what to do with document.querySelector?

[09:44:25] <arschmitz> agcolom: i just gave you access you should get a notification
[09:46:16] <agcolom> uGoMobi: is it just a scrollbar because the iframe doesn't quite fit?
[09:48:21] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes, I have access, thanks :-)
[09:48:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont think any of us have anything on android 4.3 yet do we?
[09:49:12] <agcolom> oh, I may have... 
[09:49:17] <agcolom> I need to check...
[09:50:47] <agcolom> I think I have 2 android devices in the house...
[09:51:05] <agcolom> How do I know what os this is?

[09:52:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I don't have 4.3 yet
[09:52:07] <arschmitz> agcolom: it just came out very recently though so unless you have upgraded them recently
[09:52:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe I manually update my own Galaxy Nexus
[09:52:28] <agcolom> 4.2.1
[09:52:48] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I haven't looked into the cause of the double scrollbar issue
[09:52:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not too worried yet i was just curious i think right now 4.2 is much more useful
[09:53:06] <agcolom> ok
[09:53:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i would probably avoid the upgrade for time being 4.3 is far to rare right now
[09:54:02] <uGoMobi> yeah, but might be nice to have one 4.3 device
[09:54:10] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:54:12] <uGoMobi> I can keep the Nexus 7 n 4.2

[09:54:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah we only have one issue so far though and it seems its ios too so im not to worried 
[09:54:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh that could be rough 
[09:54:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: now I get an error that git can't apply one of the commits
[09:55:31] <uGoMobi> and that I have to resolve the problem first
[09:55:50] <uGoMobi> but it's not really clear about what is the problem :/
[09:55:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you just mean like a conflict?
[09:56:33] <uGoMobi> yeah, same message but it doesn't mention "conflict"
[09:56:52] <arschmitz> yeah 
[09:58:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh wait, I think I found a way to find out what is the problem
[09:59:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: above where it says it cant resolve it should say CONFLICT and list the files
[09:59:40] <uGoMobi> I have GitHub for Mac and there it's easier to see what's going on
[09:59:58] <arschmitz> then you can just make the changes commit and --continue
[10:00:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes sometimes visual tools can be handy with git
[10:00:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, that was the problem.. it didn't mention any file

[15:13:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[15:13:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[15:14:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! I was thinking: For those widgets that have a wrapperClass option we could document that using wrapperClass renders the deprecated style options useless.
[15:14:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if ( this.options.wrapperClass ) { /* ignore deprecated style options */ }
[15:15:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not sure how to handle those widgets where the classes are applied directly to the element though.
[15:15:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe we need the fallback for those ...
[15:15:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm
[15:16:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure
[15:16:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For the wrapperClass case, it would be clear - either you use the old way (style options) or the new way (wrapperClass).
[15:16:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We provide both, so it's a proper deprecation.
[15:16:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you mean that if I use data-wrapper-classes="my-custom-class" the style options don't work anymore?
[15:16:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly.
[15:17:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you use data-wrapper-class="anything" then you commit to maintaining classes yourself.
[15:17:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You can later $( ".selector" ).widgetname( "option", "wrapperClass", "anything else" );
[15:18:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, the wrapperClass option is a proper widget option, so it works later, too.
[15:18:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am afraid this is going to be very confusing
[15:18:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: *sigh* ... that's the other possibility :)
[15:18:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That is, to hold off with all this deprecation until we can get rid of /all/ style options.
[15:19:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for example an input button... it has corners and shadow by default but when I use data-wrapper-classes to add "my-custom-class" the corners and shadow are gone
[15:20:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Don't forget. wrapperClass is a new option, so we can specify how it behaves.
[15:22:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just because, in the process of developing 1.4 we assumed that it would be used exclusively for custom classes, doesn't mean we've committed to using it exclusively for custom classes. We can still document that it renders the other options inoperable, and that would be the first ever behaviour for this option.
[15:22:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's true
[15:22:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not saying we cannot do this
[15:23:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In fact, it would prepare people for dealing with the absence of the other style options.
[15:23:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can also make it clear that some options are staying because they would be difficult to implement with a simple .toggleClass() or wrapperClass option.
[15:25:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway ... I admit it's a pretty sticky situation ... I'm kind of in favour of not deprecating in 1.4.0, but leaving it for 1.5.0, so we can look at this more thoroughly, without the release on our heels.
[15:26:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, we already have a boatload of work for 1.5.0.
[15:26:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Removing all the existing deprecations will itself be a fair chunk of work - albeit a pleasant one :)
[15:27:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree that we should not make last minute changes like this anymore
[15:27:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but reverting the deprecating costs time too
[15:28:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: about the amount of work for 1.5... we didn't decided yet what we are going to work on for 1.5
[15:29:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I really want to have a new roadmap first
[15:29:56] <uGoMobi> we have to be careful with adding next version milestones just because we would like to see it land in next version
[15:30:29] <uGoMobi> before you know we have same situation like now with 1.4 where it takes much too long before we release
[15:31:36] <uGoMobi> and when we set a milestone people expect it to land and will be disappointed when we change the milestone later
[15:31:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's true ... 
[15:33:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess we don't have so many things to do post-1.4 as not to be able to wade through the issues. In that case I suppose they can be made 1.5-2.0.

[15:36:48] <emilsedgh_> i just updated my app to 1.4.0 alpha 2. when i enable swipe events on it, the page will stop scrolling. is this a known bug? should i just report it or try investigating more?
[15:37:10] <emilsedgh_> is this a proper channel for my issue or i should go back to #jquery? 
[15:38:40] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: would be great if you can open a ticket for in the issues tracker. See https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md for instructions. Thanks!

[15:39:35] <emilsedgh_> thank you uGoMobi.
[15:39:52] <emilsedgh_> i will try investigating more to understand if this is really a jqmobile issue.
[15:40:10] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: ok great
[15:40:30] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: do you have a panel in your app?
[15:40:38] <emilsedgh_> yes i do
[15:40:44] <emilsedgh_> i use swipe events to open/close it.
[15:41:08] <uGoMobi> is this on iOS?

[15:43:04] <emilsedgh_> one other thing i noticed is that default values for $.event.special.swipe.scrollSupressionThreshold and $.event.special.swipe.horizontalDistanceThreshold have changed. with new values, non-swipe events are detected as swipe.
[15:43:16] <emilsedgh_> i dont think these two issues are related, though.
[15:44:22] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: Re: panel and swipe. Is it the same as this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6347 but on Android?
[15:44:22] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6347 by doomsy (1mon 1w ago): Scrolling vertically on panel fails after first scroll on ios device (1.4.0a2)

[15:45:46] <emilsedgh_> as it scrolls the first time for me as well
[15:46:04] <emilsedgh_> my panel isnt bigger than page, though
[15:46:58] <emilsedgh_> uGoMobi: and im not having a problem with panel scroll
[15:47:07] <emilsedgh_> my content does not scroll
[15:47:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when we use the same ticket for deprecate and remove (just changing the title) the deprecation probably won't end up in the changelog
[15:48:06] <emilsedgh_> it only happens when i have listeners for swipe* events.
[15:48:13] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: ok I see, I am not sure it is related to that issue but it sounded kinda similar
[15:48:57] <emilsedgh_> is there any kind of release plan for 1.4.0 i can take a look at?
[15:50:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I added it to the changelog.
[15:50:35] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: what do you mean by release plan? timing, changelog?
[15:50:49] <emilsedgh_> release plan and timing, uGoMobi.
[15:51:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: My process for closing a deprecation ticket is 1. API docs, 2. library, 3. changelog.
[15:51:37] <_|Nix|_> 4. Reopen as remove.
[15:51:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks, but the wiki page changelog is only used for key changes in blog post
[15:52:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I see ... you mean the autogenerated changelog.
[15:52:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the complete changelog that comes with final will be auto-generated

[15:58:10] <uGoMobi> to see if a bug is already fixed
[15:58:15] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: thanks!
[15:58:22] <emilsedgh_> yes it seems i should fetch the master
[15:58:43] <emilsedgh_> oh im going to use jqmobile from master. feels good :D
[15:58:55] <uGoMobi> :)
[15:59:03] <emilsedgh_> makes me feel im on the edge of technology, doing important work (im not, just another stupid app)
[15:59:15] <uGoMobi> lol
[15:59:22] <uGoMobi> as long as it  feels good :)
[16:03:39] <emilsedgh_> but the issue with new default values for swipe events is still there.
[16:03:52] <emilsedgh_> with new default values, any movement counts as swipe.
[16:04:13] <emilsedgh_> basically, values for scrollSupressionThreshold and horizontalDistanceThreshold seem swapped.

[16:04:24] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6422 by dhcDeWe (3w 3h ago): Idea for swipe event
[16:04:56] <emilsedgh_> ah thanks.
[16:06:48] <emilsedgh_> uGoMobi: thank you for taking the time to responding. i appreciate it.
[16:07:27] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: no problem,thanks for reporting possible bugs
[16:08:54] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: I wonder if this change causes the issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/231820361f547d8fa0e26f9bfc2ad9e1c9686a68#L0L144
[16:08:55] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Alexander Schmitz (3mon 3d ago): Swipe Event: Rewrite to trigger once threshhold has been reached instead of waiting for vmouse up this emulates native swipe event
[16:09:52] <_|Nix|_> emilsedgh_: You should also check event.target for swipe.
[16:10:06] <emilsedgh_> scrollSupressionThreshold seems to be more important, it has changed as well.
[16:10:20] <emilsedgh_> _|Nix|_: i want any swipe to open up my panel.
[16:10:55] <_|Nix|_> emilsedgh_: Hmmm ...

[16:11:23] <_|Nix|_> emilsedgh_: So, how do you know the user wants to swipe vs. highlight text?
[16:12:10] <_|Nix|_> emilsedgh_: Actually, that brings up a good point. Sometimes the two cannot be distinguished.
[16:12:23] <emilsedgh_> yeah, well i prefer my panel to open up reliably :D
[16:12:35] <emilsedgh_> i havent thought of that use case, i admin
[16:12:53] <_|Nix|_> emilsedgh_: We had a demo that had that problem.
[16:13:16] <_|Nix|_> emilsedgh_: We fixed it by checking to make sure the swipe happens on the page, not the text.
[16:13:28] <_|Nix|_> emilsedgh_: ... but since you don't care where the swipe happens ...
[16:14:02] <emilsedgh_> ah i see
[16:14:34] <_|Nix|_> emilsedgh_: I also noticed that, when moving slowly, no swipe happened.
[16:14:50] <_|Nix|_> emilsedgh_: I was able to highlight text even without checking event.target, but I had to do it slowly.

[16:16:14] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: can you reproduce the issue with this test page on your Android device http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/panel-swipe-open/#demo-page
[16:17:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Has that page been updated with your latest push, what with the recent view update delays?
[16:18:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, checked it
[16:18:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[16:18:53] <uGoMobi> view.* is updating again :)
[16:19:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yaaaay!
[16:20:29] <emilsedgh_> im sorry uGoMobi, _|Nix|_, my laptop was out of memory and started swapping
[16:20:41] <emilsedgh_> everyting freezed so i had to restart X
[16:21:00] <uGoMobi> aii
[16:21:54] <emilsedgh_> uGoMobi: will test it now.
[16:22:11] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: cool, thanks!
[16:23:51] <emilsedgh_> uGoMobi: i can reproduce the issue
[16:24:32] <emilsedgh_> well, its a little bit tricky
[16:24:40] <emilsedgh_> it seems to work fine sometimes here
[16:24:54] <emilsedgh_> let me try to see if i can find consistent behaviour
[16:25:46] <emilsedgh_> well, it seems that you have to scroll a very straight line. otherwise it detects a swipe.
[16:27:04] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: what Android version / device are you testing on?
[16:27:52] <emilsedgh_> its an HTC One using Android 4.2.2

[16:27:56] <b-ot> emilsedgh_: toddparker (14mon 4d ago): Increased the scrollSupressionThreshold from 10 to 30 pixels  This makes the swipe tolerances more forgiving so it doesn't interfere with scrolling. Fixes #2107
[16:28:23] <emilsedgh_> this is the commit that has changed the value. from the comment, it seems that it was changed to fix the issue im having

[16:40:23] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: just tested that demo page on Android 4.2 and I agree that swipe is sometimes triggered when it's not really a swipe gesture
[16:43:07] <emilsedgh_> ah, good to know its not a hallucination :p
[16:43:22] <emilsedgh_> its 3 in the morning, anything i say is not credible.
