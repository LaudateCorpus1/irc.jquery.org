[03:09:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do we have a demo about adding columns to a table?
[03:09:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[03:10:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If not, we oughta, because I'm finding that there're all kinds of problems with the columntoggle table.
[03:15:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. NM. Figured it out. There /has/ to be a data-priority attribute.

[03:16:40] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[03:17:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we had a bug. If you add a column and refresh the columntoggle table, it would destroy the controlgroup and the checkboxes would appear below one another, but ungrouped.
[03:18:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ohw :(
[03:18:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: were you able to fix it?
[03:19:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and we were adding data-mini="true" to the columns button, and the controlgroup can be instantiated before you append the element to the DOM to save on reflows.
[03:19:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I fixed it.
[03:19:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... all.
[03:20:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice, thanks!

[03:54:46] <eeezkil> click on `Open Dialog`
[03:54:46] <eeezkil> at some point the top position of the dialog gets doubled
[03:54:46] <eeezkil> every time you attempt to move the dialog down
[03:54:46] <eeezkil> I guess that it's an event problem
[03:54:47] <eeezkil> any idea?

[05:40:56] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Where did you get these polyfill implementations from?

[05:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> This looks quite different than what you used: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperties
[05:42:55] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i said "i think" :P
[05:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[05:43:04] <kborchers> must have gotten that somewhere else
[05:43:22] <kborchers> there were a few times where i was grabbing at straws to fix things
[05:50:14] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this is annoying.
[05:50:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's a polyfill for defineProperties() that relies on defineProperty().
[05:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> But then they don't provide a polyfill for defineProperty().
[05:52:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: which may be why i went with something else ;)

[06:37:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: *whew* ... columntoggle table technically supports enhanced: true, but I can't really make it work.
[06:38:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You need to add the checkboxes by hand, but they have all kinds of data attached and stuff ...
[06:38:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno ... maybe we should remove the option for 1.4 ...
[06:38:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and the checkboxes also have event handlers attached and stuff.
[06:43:37] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#937 (master - 6e29df2 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build was broken.

[06:43:37] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/12319574
[06:44:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I can imagine this isn't easy with column toggle
[06:45:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the enhanced option is in table and it shouldn't be a big problem with reflow mode I suppose
[06:46:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think we should remove the option now we are already on beta
[06:46:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and technically it is possible, like you said
[06:47:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but maybe we should not encourage yet to use it for column toggle mode
[06:47:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so should I make it work with columntoggle?
[06:47:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think I can make it work.
[06:48:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you mean it does not work yet, you have to make changes to make it work?
[06:48:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's basically a matter of attaching the handlers.
[06:48:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[06:48:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see, so if you write the markup yourself the handlers are not attached
[06:48:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We have to require that the dev provide the popup, the controlgroup, the checkboxes, and the anchor that opens the popup.
[06:49:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, but that is what enhanced is about... no DOM manio
[06:49:22] <uGoMobi> manip*
[06:49:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The popup, controlgroup, and checkboxes need not be pre-rendered, because the autoinit will take care of those.
[06:50:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There are multiple levels of enhanced.
[06:50:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You can separately choose to also pre-render the popup - or not.
[06:50:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Same with the controlgroup and the checkboxes.
[06:50:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think that when you have an option enhanced with values true or false there should be one level
[06:50:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: all or nothing
[06:51:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, you mean because it uses other widgets
[06:51:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: autoinit makes it optional.
[06:51:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's right.
[06:52:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: columntoggle depends on controlgroup and checkboxradio, so those widgets, if not themselves pre-rendered are guaranteed to be enhanced by the time _create() is called for the columntoggle table.
[06:52:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and it also depends on popup (forgot about popup).
[06:52:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so if you enhance the table yourself but use data-role attributes on the popup, controlgroup, etc auto init take care of those
[06:53:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly.
[06:53:10] <uGoMobi> and the checkboxes don't need a data-role even
[06:53:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, but you can still choose to pre-render them and indicate that you have pre-rendered them by adding data-enhanced="true".
[06:54:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, you can strike the optimal balance between download size and startup speed for your own app.
[06:54:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: gotcha
[06:54:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The only missing piece is that currently, the final product doesn't work.
[06:55:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The popup is empty.
[06:55:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wait, no.
[06:55:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The popup is not empty.
[06:55:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think for table column toggle enhanced option we should only look at the enhance *everything* yourself case
[06:55:41] <uGoMobi> and document it as such
[06:55:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... if you specify the checkboxes by hand, but they won't be connected to the columns.
[06:56:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, it's not extra work if nothing else is pre-enhanced, as long as /everything/ is added a priori.
[06:56:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we must insist that all pieces are present and retrievable during _create().
[06:56:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[06:56:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But we need not insist that they also be enhanced a priori.
[06:57:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, if that doesn't make a difference
[06:57:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: my point is that we have to keep things as simple as possible
[06:58:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and not try to support every possible situation which adds a more complexity to the code
[06:58:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It doesn't. The only thing we still need to code is to call this._addToggles( menu, true ) during _create.
[06:59:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, our code is very elegant in that we can remain oblivious to the state of the popup, the checkboxes, the controlgroup, and the anchor, as long as they're there.
[06:59:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: All we require is that the ID of the popup === the id of the table + "-popup".
[06:59:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, the call to _addToggles() is now in the enhance method?
[07:00:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, but frequent actually added a "keep" option to _addToggles() to not actually delete the old ones before creating new ones, but instead keep the existing ones and wire them up.
[07:01:02] <uGoMobi> I see
[07:01:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, all I need to do is make the call to _addToggles() from the enhanced === true branch.
[07:01:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: At least that's what it looks like right now :)
[07:02:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then why were you not sure if we should keep enhanced option in 1.4?
[07:03:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: At first I thought we would also have to handle the case where the checkboxes are missing.
[07:03:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But then I realized that we can simply require that they be added by hand to the controlgroup.
[07:03:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[07:03:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yup

[07:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> Lots of alerts.
[07:16:35] <kborchers> i mean, i pretty much just used <marquis> and <blink> and called it a day so i was fine but ;)
[07:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> That's why we didn't build complex apps back then :-)

[10:46:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: either of you around?
[10:51:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am
[10:51:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: on your way to DC?
[10:51:46] <arschmitz> yeah at the airport
[10:51:59] <arschmitz> was looking at the data-role='none' issue on buttons
[10:52:10] <arschmitz> there are 2 ways to fix this 
[10:52:26] <arschmitz> either in the page widget or in the buttonmarkup initselector
[10:52:44] <uGoMobi> I would say the last option
[10:52:50] <arschmitz> the difference comes down to if you call buttonmarkup explicitly on something
[10:53:02] <arschmitz> should it enhance regardless of data-role
[10:53:02] <uGoMobi> because when you call enhanceWithin() it shouldn't being enhanced either
[10:53:26] <arschmitz> sorry actually thats what i meant enhanceWithin or initselector
[10:53:31] <arschmitz> not page
[10:54:02] <arschmitz> like widgets if you call them on something will enhance it even if it has data-role none
[10:54:16] <arschmitz> because all the filtering is part of enhance within
[10:54:26] <arschmitz> so im thinking this should probably match that
[10:54:29] <uGoMobi> if we change the initSelector of buttonMarkup to button:not([data-role='none') would it still work if you call buttonMarkup on that element later?
[10:54:37] <arschmitz> nope
[10:54:45] <arschmitz> wait yes it would i take that back
[10:55:03] <arschmitz> so im wrong it will always work if you call directly
[10:55:11] <uGoMobi> right
[10:55:26] <uGoMobi> can't think of a good use case anyway
[10:55:26] <arschmitz> but for widgets we do all filtering in enhancewithin never in init selector
[10:55:42] <arschmitz> so my feeling is this should be the same
[10:55:43] <uGoMobi> why would you want to have an unstyled button and then style it later
[10:55:48] <arschmitz> no idea
[10:56:17] <arschmitz> but thats not actually the issue because it would work the same either way 
[10:56:27] <uGoMobi> yeah
[10:56:28] <arschmitz> its just about where it belongs
[10:57:19] <arschmitz> are you ok with putting in enhanceWithin like everything else?
[10:57:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I would say in buttonMarkup.js
[10:57:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is there a reason you think that buttonmarkup should be different then widgets?
[10:57:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I was thinking if we put it there we also remove it with buttonMarkup
[10:58:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it would get removed either way because it would be part of the call to buttonmarkup
[10:58:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, you mean it would not be widget/method specific... just data-role="none" in general?
[10:59:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: because buttonMarkup's initSelector is in buttonMarkup.js itself

[11:00:34] <arschmitz> this is not about initselector really that will always be in buttonmarkup
[11:00:57] <arschmitz> and it actually has to be enhanceWith where we do it because it should be here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.helpers.js#L196
[11:01:08] <arschmitz> it should have .not( $.mobile.page.prototype.keepNativeSelector() )
[11:01:28] <arschmitz> its not just about data-role=none its really about keepnative 
[11:01:48] <arschmitz> which can change 
[11:02:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, I thought it was different because it's a method and not a widget
[11:03:06] <arschmitz> no it should behave the same

[11:04:09] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/6e29df2074a8...2714b74853be
[11:04:09] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/12331383
[11:04:16] <arschmitz> because we talk about keepnative as stopping auto enhancement 
[11:04:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in that case it makes sense to handle it in enhanceWithin
[11:04:29] <arschmitz> and buttonmarkup is exactly that
[11:04:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on other things button related
[11:05:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if you didnt catch the ui meeting today you should read the first part where we discussed button
[11:05:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes I saw that
[11:05:59] <arschmitz> ok cool
[11:06:04] <uGoMobi> about the CSS buttons
[11:06:08] <arschmitz> yup
[11:06:10] <uGoMobi> pure CSS
[11:06:36] <arschmitz> very similar to what we do now 
[11:06:50] <arschmitz> execpt they will need to add a theme class because of lack of inheritance 
[11:08:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, that's why I said that I regret that we didn't discuss the whole UI/Mobile merge and share theming before we started developing for 1.4
[11:08:42] <arschmitz> yeah well hindsight it will get you every time 
[11:09:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: one bad decision from our past i realized is .ui-btn
[11:09:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the CSS theme inheritance is a bit different path
[11:09:41] <arschmitz> should really be .ui-button
[11:10:28] <arschmitz> if we made that one change the new button widget would work perfectly in both themes and libs without any modification 
[11:10:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: well ui-btn is used in several widgets while ui-button is more appropiate for the button widget
[11:11:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont know really shouldnt anything thats a button use ui-button? even if its in another widget we are still treating it as a button
[11:12:05] <arschmitz> its just a css only button
[11:12:50] <uGoMobi> in the future yes
[11:13:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont think we have a css style guide on contribute do we?
[11:13:44] <uGoMobi> I thought there was
[11:13:52] <arschmitz> i cant find it if there is
[11:13:56] <arschmitz> and we should have one for sure
[11:14:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: anyways, we can look into switching to .ui-button
[11:14:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and I also want to look into preprocessor
[11:14:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah mean time the classes option would fix
[11:14:59] <arschmitz> yeah mixins would solve a lot of issues 
[11:17:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: anyway i just wanted to make sure you were up to date with that
[11:17:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks
[11:17:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good luck with the accessibility summit
[11:17:45] <arschmitz> thanks
[11:17:54] <arschmitz> my flight is late lol
[11:18:02] <uGoMobi> aii :(
[11:18:14] <arschmitz> yeah only like 15 minutes so far though
[11:18:24] <arschmitz> and its only a 1 hour flight
[11:27:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can make the change for buttonMarkup. I just finished reading your discussion with uGoMobi 
[11:27:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i got it already
[11:27:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[11:27:50] <arschmitz> thanks though
[11:28:02] <arschmitz> pushing it with that toolbar fix in a min if my plane does not show first
[11:28:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then I'll keep hammering away at the pre-enhanced columntoggle table.
[11:28:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, awesome!
[11:28:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome yeah read back about that that one is a pain
[11:28:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I got it nailed now, so NP.
[11:28:50] <arschmitz> nice
[11:28:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's gonna need lots of examples though.
[11:29:04] <arschmitz> yeah i can imagine
[11:29:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, actually, not that many. I can think of two distinct ones right now, but each one is fairly involved.
[11:30:19] <arschmitz> cool
[11:34:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: have you looked at Topcoat CSS before? http://topcoat.io/topcoat/css/topcoat-desktop-dark.css
[11:34:32] <arschmitz> a bit not very much and it was quite a while ago
[11:34:56] <uGoMobi> there you see the BEM architecture
[11:35:05] <uGoMobi> all selectors are just one class
[11:35:10] <arschmitz> yeah i remember kris talking about it 
[11:35:18] <uGoMobi> that's what makes it super fast
[11:35:21] <arschmitz> yup
[11:35:51] <arschmitz> something to look into ~2.0
[11:36:00] <arschmitz> ok boarding gota go
[11:36:00] <uGoMobi> this is 2.0 stuff but that's the direction it should go
[11:36:07] <uGoMobi> ok safe travels
[11:36:10] <arschmitz> thanks

[13:24:20] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14c4d8e0a 15Gabriel Schulhof: Columntoggle table: Enable instantiation based on pre-rendered markup.
[13:27:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[13:28:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[13:28:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think? Should I move the examples to jquery.mobile-git?
[13:28:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean in the API docs.
[13:28:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and then, after jquery.mobile-1.4.0 becomes available, we move them to it and release.
[13:29:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure if I follow you
[13:29:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Currently, all examples under /resources/<widgetname>/examplennn.html use <script src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.0-beta.1/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-beta.1.min.js"></script>
[13:30:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Same for the stylesheet.
[13:30:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, those files do not reflect changes we've made since then, so all the iframes in the API docs use old code.
[13:30:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok I understand
[13:31:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'd like to move those examples to git, so, for example, the pre-rendered columntoggle example I made actually works.
[13:32:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in general I wanted to reduce the amount of things we have to do manually before we release
[13:32:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so I am thinking about other solutions
[13:33:06] <uGoMobi> (but nothing came up yet)
[13:33:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, this is an unavoidable step. The API docs can never refer to the version of jQM that we're about to release, because, well, we haven't released it yet :)
[13:34:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and if we make a "latest" symlink on the CDN, then they'll be out of date during the whole development cycle.
[13:35:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: one moment, I take a look first
[13:37:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was thinking maybe we could use PHP instead of HTML files for the iframe and use a var
[13:37:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or make the insertion of the jQM version part of the build.
[13:38:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[13:38:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but don't know if that's possible
[13:38:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can solve that for the iframes, but I'm not sure how to do it for the inline examples.
[13:39:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can have a look at the build process and try to figure it out. scott_gonzalez can probably help me too.
[13:39:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... then we can switch the repo to git and switch to whatever version we want on the way to wordpress.
[13:40:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... default being to not switch versions.
[13:40:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sounds good
[13:40:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Come to think of it, the same thing applies to the version of core used in the examples.
[13:40:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... that is, we should be able to specify that too.
[13:40:58] <scott_gonzalez> You're talking about local testing, right?
[13:41:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, same thing
[13:41:12] <scott_gonzalez> Since the sites don't exist until the version exists.
[13:41:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Primarily yes, but release as well.
[13:41:23] <scott_gonzalez> You don't release the API site until the code is on the CDN.
[13:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> So there's no problem on the live site.
[13:41:46] <scott_gonzalez> For local testing, you can edit your template to point at git if you want, just don't commit it.
[13:41:53] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's right, but before you release the API site you must migrate all the examples over to the CDN URLs for the new release.
[13:42:07] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's a commit.
[13:42:22] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: There are template-based examples, but there are also examples under /resources.
[13:42:23] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you're talking about the million iframe examples.
[13:42:33] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... as well as the template.
[13:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but the template is just one place.
[13:42:45] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Moving to a new version requires updating the template.
[13:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> It's easy.
[13:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> The resources are the pain.
[13:43:49] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Since you have to make a commit to update the template, another solution would be to write a grunt task that modifies the repo. However, I'm squeamish about writing such a task.
[13:44:03] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Running grunt <anything> should not result in anything committable.
[13:44:56] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I usually run sed over the resources when I wanna update the version, but it's a commit every time :/
[13:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> There should be a commit when you want to change versions on a production site.
[13:48:02] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Agreed, and I'm capable of producing a utility that will systematically replace the jQM version in all the resources. The question is, would such a utility be useful separately, and, if so, shall I write it as a shell script dropped into the repo root, or as a grunt task. If such a utility is not useful, shall we make updating the jQM version part of the deploy proces? Like grunt wordpress-deploy --jqm-version=1.4.0 --jq-c
[13:49:09] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I think maybe making it part of the wordpress-deploy task would be bad, because the jQM version in the repo does not reflect the jQM version in wordpress.
[13:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> Absolutely not part of the deploy process.
[13:50:06] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Then maybe we need to modify the step where one edits the template to also include this sed over the resources.
[13:50:35] <scott_gonzalez> That step is whatever you want it to be.
[13:51:29] <scott_gonzalez> I assume you have a document for all the steps to do a release that aren't covered in the release script itself.
[13:51:31] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/59346425/Release%20Checklist
[13:51:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Right, so we probably have it listed on a deploy checklist. In that case, I can write a shell script and replace the step on that checklist with "Run set-lib-versions.sh".
[13:51:59] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I'm assuming that too.

[13:53:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's ask agcolom if she made a list

[13:53:39] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ^

[13:54:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, nothing on https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/wiki ...
[13:55:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I meant https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Release-Instructions-Checklist
[13:55:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but don't see API docs instructions in there
[13:56:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know. I figured agcolom may have stashed something away at the API docs wiki.
