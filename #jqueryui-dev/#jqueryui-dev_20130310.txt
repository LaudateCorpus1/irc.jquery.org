[14:22:38] <agcolom>  message to everyone... My understanding is the US switched to Summer time today. Europe is switching in 3 weeks. Might be worth checking everyone knows as this means meeting will take place 1h early for the next 3 weeks Europe time.
[16:05:34] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you there?
[16:05:51] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov yep!
[16:05:54] <mikesherov> gnarf: do you know when http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js updates?
[16:06:11] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: maybe you know ^ ?
[16:06:24] <DaveMethvin> probably same as us, when the jenkins job runs
[16:06:27] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[16:07:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's when the "jQuery UI" job runs http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/configure
[16:07:20] <DaveMethvin> you have to be logged in to see that i think
[16:09:16] <mikesherov> hmm
[16:09:26] <mikesherov> well, it looks like it's not being updated
[16:09:55] <DaveMethvin> that job hasn't run for a while, ... yesterday?
[16:09:56] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: ^
[16:10:12] <mikesherov> http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js 
[16:10:19] <mikesherov> look for this: this.containers[innermostIndex]._trigger("over", event, this._uiHash(this));
[16:10:26] <DaveMethvin> oh.... http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/1001/console
[16:10:31] <DaveMethvin> that is the last run
[16:10:57] <mikesherov> vs. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.sortable.js#L846
[16:11:37] <mikesherov> hrphm
[16:11:47] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: how do I rerun a Jenkins job?
[16:11:56] <DaveMethvin> jamesmgreene and Krinkle|detached were talking about this on friday in #jquery-dev i think but i wasn't paying attention
[16:12:09] <DaveMethvin> you can do it from jenkins if you're logged in
[16:12:11] <DaveMethvin> i'll start it
[16:12:37] <DaveMethvin> started http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/1002/console
[16:12:52] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #1002: STILL FAILING in 31 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/1002/
[16:13:03] <DaveMethvin> same prob
[16:14:39] <mikesherov> :-\
[16:14:45] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-dev/%23jquery-dev_20130309.log.html#t06:36:16
[16:15:23] <mikesherov> OK
[16:15:28] <mikesherov> Thanks DaveMethvin 
[16:16:02] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov also http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-dev/%23jquery-dev_20130308.log.html#t07:45:11
[16:16:12] <DaveMethvin> dunno what is causing it tho
[16:16:24] <DaveMethvin> now i'm glad core doesn't use phantomjs
[16:17:53] <mikesherov> oh well
[16:18:09] <mikesherov> it wouldn't be so bad if at least it still updated git
