[05:43:27] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you there?
[06:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Thanks. Now I can try my craziness :-)
[06:03:36] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I'm here now...
[06:04:50] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you were pinging me yesterday
[06:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I had two questions for you.
[06:05:40] <scott_gonzalez> 1) Are you ok with this? https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/88b30c7f937bb707c92e
[06:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember what #2 was :-/
[06:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> That code has no test coverage.
[06:07:33] <mikesherov> yeah, I hate the loopfunc option
[06:08:37] <mikesherov> It seems ok
[06:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll land it.
[06:24:09] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...is this total insanity or brilliance? http://jsbin.com/ajomiy/1/edit
[06:28:13] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: ^
[06:29:17] <mikesherov> I love "element", I hate SVG
[06:29:50] <mikesherov> woah and it uses templates
[06:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> This gives us the benefit of inheriting colors like fonts do.
[06:30:16] <scott_gonzalez> But without the random characters used by fonts.
[06:32:22] <mikesherov> would be nice to be able to do <ui-icon style="color: #0f0;">foo</ui-icon>
[06:32:51] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[06:40:01] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Sure, you can do that too
[06:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> But this will be common usage, where you're inheriting the color from a parent element.
[06:40:54] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: http://jsbin.com/ajomiy/2/edit
[06:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> The second icon uses the style directly on the icon.
[06:41:25] <mikesherov> oh, right
[06:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> So the goal would be something like <ui-icon data-icon="arrow-down">
[06:41:38] <mikesherov> sure
[06:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it's time to learn a bit of SVG and create a fuller test.
[06:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> But it's good to know this works :-)
[06:45:19] <mikesherov> very cool
