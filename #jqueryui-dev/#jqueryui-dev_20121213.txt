[05:16:41] <alex116> hi I'm getting an error with $.widget.extend
[05:16:50] <alex116> it can't be found when loading.
[05:17:08] <alex116> using jquery 1.8.3 and jqueryui 1.9.2
[05:17:23] <scott_gonzalez> ?channels @alex116
[05:17:24] <bot-t> alex116, For support please go to #jquery | Development Channels: #jquery-dev - #jqueryui-dev - #jquerymobile-dev - #jquery-content | All Meetings held in#jquery-meeting http://jquery.org/meeting
[05:18:15] <alex116> hi @scott_gonzalez, how to I go to that channel?
[05:18:16] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, i think i would like to hear from Hans before we decide what way to go on indeterminate pb. good point on labeling the demos, i'll add that to my list
[05:18:30] <scott_gonzalez> alex116: How did you get to this channel?
[05:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: When it gets a little later into the day, I plan on pinging Mozilla a11y.
[05:19:06] <jzaefferer> kborchers: We can do a bit more work before bothering Hans. I've out of options for selectmenu, so if Hans has time, I'd like him to focus on that for now.
[05:19:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: cool
[05:19:22] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok
[05:19:26] <alex116> @scott_gonzalez ok got it
[05:20:18] <jzaefferer> kborchers: maybe we can do a progressbar demo, where a notification dialog tells the user that something is loading
[05:20:34] <jzaefferer> with a button triggering that dialog, so that is happens after some user interaction
[05:20:39] <alex116> so which one do you recommend? I mean I joined this one because I thought it was the right one.
[05:20:44] <jzaefferer> that's a much more realistic scenario
[05:21:11] <scott_gonzalez> "For support please go to #jquery"
[05:21:15] <jzaefferer> kborchers: or put a progressbar on a page and have it "loading assets" or something, simulating a html game. Again with proper labelling and something happening afterwards
[05:22:27] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok sounds good. i can work on one or both of those. probably do both and then we can decide which is better or keep both
[05:23:02] <jzaefferer> kborchers: let's do that and it with test aria-valuetext
[05:23:18] <jzaefferer> kborchers: we can ping Hans when we run out of options

[05:23:43] <jzaefferer> ugh: http://swarm.jquery.org/
[05:23:44] <jzaefferer> what a mess
[05:24:04] <kborchers> oh my
[05:24:05] <scott_gonzalez> ouch
[05:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> The one day that I don't check swarm the first thing in the morning.
[05:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> I could've been blissfully ignorant today.
[05:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> Did out BrowserStack script die?
[05:25:14] <jzaefferer> https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/browserstack
[05:26:09] <jzaefferer> all dead since 12:30pm?
[05:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, these times must be localized :-)
[05:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...wait, that wouldn't be 12:30 for you.
[05:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> One of us has the wrong settings in Splunk.
[05:28:20] <scott_gonzalez> It must be you, I've got mines set to ET.
[05:28:23] <jzaefferer> I've got the default timezone
[05:28:26] <jzaefferer> changing that
[05:29:06] <jzaefferer> well, 9 hours later...
[05:29:18] <jzaefferer> default must be Pacific
[05:45:07] <jzaefferer> everything just stopped at that point in time. I can't tell why
[05:45:17] <jzaefferer> cli.log is what splunk shows, run.log is empty
[05:46:28] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, we have shorter url live at stage so you guys can check it..
[05:47:00] <rxaviers> known bug: clicking Download at a themeGallery theme (the urls there is longer than it should)
[05:48:40] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the previous issue is resolved?
[05:48:48] <rxaviers> which
[05:48:55] <rxaviers> one
[05:49:10] <jzaefferer> "customize theme" link on /download, "download" link on /themeroller
[05:49:17] <jzaefferer> the 502 error
[05:50:31] <rxaviers> yeap, pretty much because now we have shorter urls
[05:50:45] <rxaviers> Im testing different combinations now to check that
[05:56:00] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: so what's with the gallery links? do you know how to address that as well?
[05:58:08] <rxaviers> to build its url faster, I use a slightly different way to build its querystring than I normally do. That's not using the shorter size https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/app/resources/model.js#L354
[05:58:15] <rxaviers> shortest*
[05:59:12] <rxaviers> need to improve that
[06:01:36] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: the crontab on the server where testswarm-browserstack is running doesn't mention that at all. I've created an infrastructure issue for now: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/135

[06:23:15] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: for the record, although I can't provide repro steps, I've personally experienced this bug: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7555
[06:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> Using 1.9.x?
[06:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> So far we've had 2 people say they know what causes they bug and they've both been wrong.
[06:26:57] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: no
[06:27:16] <scott_gonzalez> Which version?
[06:27:52] <mikesherov> only in 1.8.x, I'm not in front of my codebase at the moment
[06:29:08] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: So, everything that this second guy described is 1.8.x-specific.
[06:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> I just looked and 1.8.x listened to menu blur.
[06:35:50] <mikesherov> I think that was our fix as well.
[06:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> I really don't think this bug exists anymore. And the milestone on the ticket is 1.9.0.
[06:36:09] <scott_gonzalez> So if everyone seeing this behavior is still on 1.8.x, that makes sense.
[06:36:34] <mikesherov> yeah, I agree. I was just saying that I also saw the bug so you could ask me any additional questions
[06:37:40] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I spent weeks tracking down the bug.
[06:48:47] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I haven't started / broken something. The cron should be fine. It is in etc/crontab in jq03
[06:49:05] <Krinkle> it isn't running from cron, it is kept running from cron
[06:49:20] <Krinkle> cron entry checks  `ps aux`, if not there, it restarts it
[06:50:07] <Krinkle> checking now
[06:50:35] * Krinkle moves to #jquery-dev

[07:31:33] <rxaviers> If that's the case, my plan is to make the zip computation in the server. And use ajax requests in the browser. That will make it pretty smooth

[09:42:19] <doesallmagic> * Scott Gonz√°lez: Release: Add support for pre-releases.
[09:58:37] <Danwe_WMDE> is there an explanation/documentation somewhere in which cases widget.element and widget.widget() are supposed to be different?
[09:58:59] <scott_gonzalez> Danwe_WMDE: Do you mean in general or per widget?
[09:59:07] <Danwe_WMDE> scott_gonzalez: in general
[09:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> This is the extent of it: http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-widget
[09:59:41] <Danwe_WMDE> e.g. the auto complete does that
[09:59:42] <scott_gonzalez> If the widget generates a wrapper, or other disconnected element, .widget() should return that.
[10:00:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, because autocomplete generates a disconnected menu.
[10:01:45] <Danwe_WMDE> scott_gonzalez: mmh, so it is legitim to call .element from outside? This is not suppose to be private, is it?
[10:02:18] <scott_gonzalez> All properties are private.
[10:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> Why would you ever call .element from outside?
[10:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you're using the instances directly.
[10:02:36] <scott_gonzalez> In which case, go ahead.
[10:08:32] <Danwe_WMDE> scott_gonzalez: I have a widget using an auto suggester internally (I keep the reference to the object rather than the DOM element here). So i have the auto suggestor's instance here and I want the input element, not the menu, to enable/disable it.
[10:09:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's legit.
[10:09:38] <Danwe_WMDE> So, if I have several disconnected elements, what would widget() return? Both?
[10:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'd need to know more about the widget, but presumably whatever the main or most important one is.
[10:10:43] <scott_gonzalez> And you can add additional methods for the others.
[10:12:16] <Danwe_WMDE> scott_gonzalez: I find it a little confusing, So far I always added additional methods for stuff like an auto suggestor's menu, let the widget() return the initial DOM element because I like to work with instances of $.Widget rather than DOM nodes and calling .data()
[10:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> .element will always be a reference to the original element.
[10:14:17] <scott_gonzalez> I should change what I said before.
[10:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> .element is public.
[10:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> But from the jQuery API perspective, all properties are private.
[10:14:46] <scott_gonzalez> .element is guaranteed to always work.
[10:14:58] <Danwe_WMDE> I guess it makes sense then^^
[10:15:20] <Danwe_WMDE> design wise a bit problematic, but ok
[10:15:45] <Danwe_WMDE> thank you for the clarification!
[10:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> no problem

[11:57:26] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, may I update jqueryui again with Prereleases?
[11:58:25] <rxaviers> (have you tagged it and updated live site already? Or is it better to wait and make sure everything is alright there for the update so we avoid reverting config?)
[12:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Should be fine to go back.
[12:06:59] <rxaviers> cool ok will make some changes there then
[12:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> You can revert my revert :-)
[12:07:19] <rxaviers> ahaha
[12:09:18] <rxaviers> definitely I should be working in a branch :P

[13:09:37] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hi, regarding the dependencies in widget (api docs), do all mobile widgets depend on the widget factory?
[13:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:10:07] <scott_gonzalez> Though, their base dependency is the mobile widget, which itself depends on the widget factory.
[13:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> Since Mobile uses AMD, you can actually look at the top of each widget source file to get the dependency list.
[13:12:31] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: perfect! Thank you :-)
[13:14:16] <agcolom> (sorry I only saw your message this morning)
[13:15:33] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
