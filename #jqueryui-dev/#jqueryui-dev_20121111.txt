[08:53:53] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: you there?
[08:54:03] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: kinda
[08:54:18] <mikesherov> just wanted to make sure you saw I rebased the dialog-review ticket
[08:54:38] <mikesherov> and I rebased the dialog branch as well
[08:54:47] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: ^
[09:02:32] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: got it, thanks; will improve that test, then go on with the other TODOs
[09:02:53] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: great. I had a lot of feedback there. Hopefully that's what you were looking for
[09:03:39] <jzaefferer> yep, that's great
[09:08:01] <mikesherov> what's the deal with all these old, unmerged pull requests with no comments from us?
[09:08:16] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/659 for example
[09:08:22] <mikesherov> seems like a reasonable PR...
[09:08:35] <mikesherov> and if it isn't, we should at least say something!
[09:12:14] <jzaefferer> yeah...
[09:12:44] <jzaefferer> six months ago 1.9 was already "really close"
[09:18:50] <mikesherov> I mean, I don't really know how that makes a difference. We should always be communicating back to contributors
[09:18:57] <mikesherov> it makes us look like a ghost town
[09:19:31] <mikesherov> At least it would help me figure out what to do with these pullsâ€¦ :-)
[09:19:54] <mikesherov> I basically just went through all of them saying, please rebase and add unit tests.
[09:20:29] <mikesherov> But once they do or don't respond, I'd like a plan of attack to either merge or close all of them. Does that make sense, jzaefferer?
[09:23:38] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: yeah, once they have tests, we should land them. We now already have a lot more bandwidth than we had half a year ago
[09:24:17] <mikesherov> Oh, I'm not knocking you guys :-) I'm just trying to figure out if there's a reason beyond bandwidth
[09:24:26] <mikesherov> and it seems like there isn't, which is good!
[09:27:10] <mikesherov> So, I'm just going to finish up requesting the tests, and then wait a bit to either merge, close, or write the tests myself!
[09:33:12] <jzaefferer> sounds good, thanks
[09:33:58] <jzaefferer> generally its still a good idea to focus on things close on the roadmap: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[09:34:27] <jzaefferer> so any blocker bugs, dialog, etc.
[09:35:53] <jzaefferer> though clearing PR queue is on there as well :-)
[09:45:56] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: ^
[09:47:11] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: I think that's all well and good, and I'll do whatever you guys think is best, however I like to focus on bugs and IMO that never has a milestone
[09:47:24] <mikesherov> it's good for the community to see pull requests commented on and closed
[09:47:50] <jzaefferer> yep, it is
[09:48:06] <jzaefferer> just a matter of making a choice between something on the immediate roadmap and something further down
[09:48:23] <jzaefferer> I'm not asking you to work on Menubar, even though that would also help a lot
[09:48:25] <mikesherov> and it helps build up the test suiteâ€¦ etc, etc. And it seems as if letting you guys focus on the roadmap, while I stick around in triage and github might be a good separation of roles
[09:48:38] <mikesherov> Sure, I can work on whatever is important! :-)
[09:48:48] <jzaefferer> menubar actually lacks units
[09:49:09] <mikesherov> Does anything else lack units?
[09:49:29] <mikesherov> Because really, that's part of my personal mission:
[09:49:55] <mikesherov> 1. clean PR queue 2. clean bug tracker 3. everything linted 4. everything tested :-)
[09:50:36] <mikesherov> that way, we have a project that is ripe for additional contribution from outsiders!
[09:54:43] <mikesherov> ok, g2g jzaefferer, all PR's have been commented on requesting tests and rebases. I'll bring up what to do with them at the meeting on Wednesday. Enjoy the rest of the weekend!
[09:55:56] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: great, thanks
[11:45:24] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: were you aware of http://oksoclap.com/ui-pull-requests ?
[13:24:13] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! I thought you showed me something at summit regarding a note on how to attach event handlers... in the ui docs or the api docs... But I cannot find it again! Did I dream this? Thanks :-)
[17:59:46] <mikesherov> kborchers or gnarf, you there?

[18:19:41] <mikesherov> I was just going to ask if http://git.io/bodiqQ was cool to land
[18:19:44] <mikesherov> but TOO LATE!
[18:20:21] <gnarf> heh
[18:20:43] <mikesherov> trying to clean up the pull request queue
[18:21:15] <gnarf> seems sane
[18:21:29] <mikesherov> yeah
[18:21:55] <gnarf> listening to a talk in Korean ATM ;)
[18:22:15] <mikesherov> did you speak already?
[18:22:20] <gnarf> I'm last :/
[18:22:31] <gnarf> so i get to sit around letting the nerves go crazy all day
[18:27:37] <mikesherov> sucks
[18:30:18] <gnarf> not that terrible - but still a little reliving to actually give the presentation ya know

[18:54:22] <mikesherov> gnarf, kborchers when you get a chance: would love an update on this ancient pull request: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/185
[18:54:36] <gnarf> oh god
[18:54:37] <gnarf> :)
[18:54:39] <gnarf> yeah
[18:54:44] <gnarf> I wanna try to land it in 1.10
[18:54:49] <gnarf> but i doubt i'll get to it
[18:55:01] <mikesherov> I mean, aside from me testing it, what needs to be done?
[18:55:17] <gnarf> not even sure
[18:55:24] <gnarf> scott needs to approve it
[18:55:38] <gnarf> I don't think split effects are on the 1.10 roadmap tho
[18:55:43] <gnarf> 1.11++

[18:55:52] <doesallmagic> mike.sherov: Accordion: Enhance refresh to allow adding/removing panels. Fixes #4672 -  Accordion: ability to add/remove panels
[18:57:15] <mikesherov> I see, so you guys seem pretty strict about roadmap
[18:57:27] <mikesherov> would never land a feature like that ahead of schedule
[18:57:31] <gnarf> its more about scope
[18:57:31] <mikesherov> makes sense
[18:57:35] <mikesherov> right
[18:57:37] <gnarf> we can't let split slow down 1.10
[18:57:42] <mikesherov> sure
[18:57:59] <mikesherov> but bug fixes, those can land pretty much anytime ?
[18:58:12] <gnarf> yes
[18:58:18] <mikesherov> especially if there are pull requests for them, I'd imagine
[18:58:28] <mikesherov> yeah, that's what jzaefferer had said
[18:59:33] <mikesherov> OK, sleepy time
[18:59:36] <mikesherov> later gnarf
