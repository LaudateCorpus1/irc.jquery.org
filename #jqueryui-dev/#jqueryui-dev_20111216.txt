[12:23:14] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i love that your ticket responses are exactly what i am thinking "Why would you even turn a text input into a button?"
[12:23:36] <scott_gonzalez> seriously, what could he possibly be trying to do?
[12:23:45] <kborchers> no idea
[12:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> $( "*" ).box().button()
[12:24:09] <kborchers> exactly!!!
[12:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[12:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> I thought this was a standard use case for the button. I'm using button for just about all my form components: anchors (a), input, textarea, and of coarse buttons. The reason is simplicity. I add a button class to each component, call $(".button").button(), and call it a day :).
[12:48:56] <kborchers> i've been staring at the screen for 2 minutes trying to come up with some response to this ... nothing
[12:49:05] <kborchers> speechless
[12:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> added to ridiculous bug list for next dramatic reading session...
[12:52:42] <kborchers> nice ... can i read the part of scott.gonzalez???
[12:53:53] <kborchers> Though i don't know if i would be able to get through "That doesn't make any sense. Text fields aren't buttons." without falling over laughing
[13:49:42] <scott_gonzalez> heh, yeah, good luck, I couldn't get through my lines last time :-P
