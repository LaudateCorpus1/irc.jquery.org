[03:59:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Same goes for href="http://code.jquery.com/
[03:59:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What about href="http://en.wikipedia.org?
[03:59:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure what you mean... are those changes not in the 1-4 branch after you rebased?
[03:59:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They exist in some places, but not all.
[04:00:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[04:00:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, we should remove the http protocol
[04:00:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I'll make code.jquery.com and api.jquery.com protocol-relative, but what about en.wikipedia.org?
[04:01:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It appears in the table examples.
[04:01:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... for all those movie titles.
[04:01:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just leave those
[04:02:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[04:09:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What about <p>The <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/">ThemeRoller</a> allows you to create...
[04:09:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Protocol-relative-ize that one?
[04:10:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I would say everything that we host ourselves, so yes
[04:10:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but would have to ask scott_gonzalez to be sure
[04:10:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[04:10:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, code.jquery.com and api.jquery.com is done.
[04:10:48] <uGoMobi> great, thanks

[04:13:04] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/061-4-rebased 14243573a 15Gabriel Schulhof: Make URLs protocol-relative.
[04:13:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you mean master? or did you already create a 1-3 branch?
[04:14:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've already created 1-3, but it currently coincides with master.
[04:14:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if I were to make this change to 1-3, that would be the first divergent commit.
[04:15:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is this only about that theme roller link?
[04:16:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. All links - just like 1-4-rebased.
[04:16:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't get it
[04:16:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, how come the front page now says "jQuery Mobile 1.3 API Documentation"?
[04:17:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 1-4-rebased is a branch on top of master.
[04:17:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the front page is now managed by jquery-wp-content
[04:17:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: master and 1-3 are currently identical.
[04:17:25] <uGoMobi> with some PHP to set version
[04:17:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. That's what I figured was going on.
[04:18:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, but the changes you just made in 1-4, I suppose those were files that are not on master/1-3
[04:18:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think so.
[04:18:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This is not a change that can be cherry-picked.
[04:18:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have to run the same command lines on 1-3 as well.
[04:19:01] <uGoMobi> wait a sec
[04:19:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we shouldn't make any more commits on master, because 1-4-rebased will eventually /become/ master.
[04:19:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Scott made changes on master
[04:19:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know.
[04:19:33] <_|Nix|_> I rebased everything to include those changes.
[04:19:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: those are in 1-4 as well after you rebased
[04:19:38] <uGoMobi> right
[04:19:39] <_|Nix|_> Yes.
[04:20:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but you said there were other files that still had protocol relative url's
[04:20:13] <uGoMobi> in 1-4 that is
[04:20:16] <_|Nix|_> But we should make no more changes to master until 1-4-rebased is ready to /become/ master, because right now it's sitting right on top of master, which means you can simply git merge 1-4-rebased and it will fast-forward.
[04:20:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If I did my work correctly, 1-4 is no longer relevant, because 1-4-rebased is what we should be working with.
[04:21:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if there is something that needs to be changed everywhere, no matter what branch/version then that change should be made on master
[04:21:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we should be making commits to 1-4-rebased if it's relevant for 1.4.0, and we should be making commits to 1-3 if it's relevant for 1.3.x.
[04:21:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, that doesn't sound correct to me
[04:21:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If a change needs to be made to both, it should be made on 1-4-rebased and then cherry picked to 1-3.
[04:22:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, it should be made on master and 1-4 should be rebased again
[04:22:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The reason for this is that 1-4-rebased is supposed to become master. That's why I rebased it.
[04:22:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and cherry-picked from master into 1-3
[04:23:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But master and 1-3 currently coincide, so you don't need to cherry-pick. You can simple fast-forward 1-3.
[04:23:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, I guess we can do it your way, but constantly rebasing such a large number of commits is prone to confliclts.
[04:24:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not to mention polluting the repo with piles of unreachable commits.
[04:24:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe I miss something and I am certainly not a Git expert
[04:25:20] <uGoMobi> but to me it make sense to make any non-version specific change on master and only version specific changes in a branch
[04:25:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Currently we have this: ...--[commit]--[commit]-[1-3 & master]--[commit]--[commit]--...--[1-4-rebased]
[04:25:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nice and linear.
[04:26:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if we make a change to master, we can easily make the same change to 1-3 without the need for a cherry-pick, but we then have to rebase all of 1-4-rebased onto the new master.
[04:27:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: As I understood the plan, eventually we will fast-forward master so that things look like this: ...--[commit]--[commit]-[1-3]--[commit]--[commit]--...--[1-4-rebased & master]
[04:28:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and then we rename 1-4-rebased to 1-4.
[04:29:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: After that, if we need to make changes that affect both the 1.4.0 API docs and the 1.3.x API docs, we will make the changes on master and cherry-pick to 1-3. Just like we do with the library.
[04:29:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, the last part I understand :)
[04:30:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you are sure that it is the right way to do it, please go ahead
[04:31:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just don't see what change in 1-4 should be cherry-picked into 1-3
[04:31:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: None, currently.
[04:31:34] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[04:31:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll fast forward master into 1-4-rebased, and I'll delete branch 1-4-rebased.
[04:32:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I will not delete 1-4 yet, in case there are some things on that branch that I mistakenly broke during the rebase.
[04:32:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, let's not delete anything yet
[04:33:22] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15gabrielschulhof merged 061-4-rebased into 06master: 02http://git.io/1j4CCQ

[04:34:14] <_|Nix|_> OK. So, now we have 1-4 from before the rebase, 1-3 which has not yet diverged from master, and we have master, which contains the 1.4.0 API docs.
[04:36:39] <_|Nix|_> Well, there is one thing I forgot about ... squashing ... we were supposed to squash the more trivial commits ... 
[04:57:06] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_ uGoMobi: Do NOT make all of our sites protocol relative.
[04:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> api.* and code.* should be relative.
[04:57:23] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.org is always HTTPS
[04:57:27] <scott_gonzalez> everything else is always HTTP
[04:57:42] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ok
[04:57:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sorry, my bad
[04:58:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it was only one link to the theme roller, right?
[04:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> Within a site, all links to other pages in that site should be rooted.
[04:58:23] <uGoMobi> right
[05:01:10] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Why did you make 1-3 already?
[05:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> It sounds like you need to do the following
[05:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> delete 1-4
[05:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> rename 1-4-rebase to 1-4
[05:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> delete 1-3
[05:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> Continue working in master for 1.3.x until the moment that 1-4 is ready to become master.
[05:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, I see you already went ahead and merged stuff.
[05:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> You should really go back to having master be 1-3 until you've cleaned squashed 1-4.
[05:07:24] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, I missed the squashing step.
[05:07:34] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I'm prepared to reset master to 1-3.
[05:07:45] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Just wasn't sure it was kosher to reset master like that.
[05:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> It's not a great thing to do, but it should happen.
[05:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> You're going to screw up everybody's checkout.
[05:08:18] <scott_gonzalez> But I doubt anyone has unpushed changes.
[05:08:22] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and I don't want to delete 1-4 until I'm certain that the rebase is correct.
[05:08:35] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's why I introduced branch 1-4-rebased.
[05:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> If you weren't certain about that, you absolutely should not have merged to master.
[05:09:32] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, yeah ... anyhoo ... I'll put things back. After all, it was all fast-forwards, so this should result in no new commits.
[05:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't matter if it results in new commits or not, it's going to put everyone's repo out of sync.
[05:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> Well, actually, anyone who hasn't pulled yet will probably be fine.
[05:10:58] <scott_gonzalez> Since you're rewinding history.

[05:13:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll push 1-4-old as the un-rebased version.

[05:14:53] <_|Nix|_> Oh, so we don't actually want 1-3?
[05:15:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not yet
[05:15:19] <uGoMobi> we should create it just before we merge 1-4 into master
[05:15:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[05:16:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: same as the library, we don't create 1.4-stable before we actually release
[05:17:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, kinda, except in our case at the point of release we want to create both 1.4-stable and 1.3-stable at the same time :)
[05:18:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, but still the same concept
[05:18:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 1.3-stable only for historical reasons, because it's really an old version of master.
[05:18:59] <_|Nix|_> git - gotta love it ....
[05:19:35] <uGoMobi> so it should really be an old version of master at the point of release, not from master few commits before release and some cherry-picked commits
[05:20:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Agreed, although I don't think we'll find anything else we want both 1.3.x and 1.4.0 to have.
[05:20:34] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:21:32] <uGoMobi> but still it's good to make it an habit to do this last moment
[05:21:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, of course.
[05:22:00] <_|Nix|_> :)
[05:23:26] <_|Nix|_> I'm not sure how we should handle the squashing ... there was talk of one commit per entry, but that's only possible between the sweeping commits ... at least without conflicts ...
[05:23:54] <_|Nix|_> I guess we should do the squashing right before we merge, because squashing involves no code changes.
[05:24:04] <_|Nix|_> "code"
[05:24:20] <scott_gonzalez> No, you should squash now, so that you can deal with any issues that arise.
[05:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> Any sweeping commits can stay. But you shouldn't have 100+ commits.
[05:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> I don't even want to know how you ended up needing to do this: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/902b7e9098f2b3fcc7ad4efb9e9ddaa76b2a4cdd
[05:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> But that's concerning.
[05:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> Are you using the misc category in master? https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/ed5fd8f4c93c5a3e6b675c6ede792ba282df76ca
[05:27:15] <scott_gonzalez> Why wouldn't this be in master? https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/4272b9a6d25336abd4aa7640f7b46091474df6a2
[05:27:36] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Because css-framework does not exist in 1-3.
[05:27:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and master and 1-3 currently coincide.
[05:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> The documents don't exist or the concept doesn't exit?
[05:28:03] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Neither.
[05:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> If it's just "we didn't document it" that's not a reason.
[05:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> Why isn't stuff like this in master? https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/df43d0bce400c6b5b41b2f5762c62c7003c52c39
[05:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> And stuff like this should be squashed https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/a7b77189d0e5ab4c6a569938cc550845a9c8d45f and https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/87524e72cf0a2f786e6f866b5547facf6182aa2e
[05:30:54] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The xhtml stuff is in 1-3, but the CDATA is not, so it's  ...data-highlight="true"&gt;
[05:31:19] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That was one of the major sources of conflict.
[05:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> Why should 1-3 and 1-4 be divergent about that?
[05:32:22] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's a good point. When I resolved the conflict, I had the choice of moving the CDATA stuff as well, but I also wanted to confine myself to what the commit had intended to do, otherwise, because of my editing, the commit's description has nothing to do with the changes it actually makes.
[05:33:16] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, what really needs to be done is this: The order of commits in 1-4 needs to be changed so that 1-4 starts with commits that can go into 1-3 as well, and then 1-3 and master can be fast-forwarded partway into 1-4.
[05:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> That's one way to reword what I said the other day.
[05:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> Which is that everything in 1-4 which isn't 1.4.x specific needs to go into master.
[05:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> And then 1-4 needs to be rebased on top of that.
[05:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> You can change the order of getting there, but it needs to happen.
[05:36:18] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I'll try to re-order the CDATA commits, but man ... the context of all those <pre><code> sections is all different, so it's gonna be a fun conflict resolution session.
[05:37:05] <scott_gonzalez> context or content?
[05:37:27] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The context of the hunks.
[05:37:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The content too ... new examples added 'n all that.
[05:38:22] <scott_gonzalez> Well, pain usually leads to learning to do things the right way :-P
[05:38:36] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Tell me about it.
[05:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> Keep in mind that you'll be actively maintaining the 1-3 branch for a long time.
[05:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> We're still maintaining 1-8 for UI.
[05:42:46] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I'm sooo moving the commits that rename/delete/add forward ... 
[05:46:01] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: to get the demos at jquerymobile.com/demos/ instead of view.* I created a directory /demos/ in the jquerymobile.com repo with subdirectories for each version. Can I exclude the demos directory from the build/validate process or should I do this in another way?
[05:47:56] <_|Nix|_> Wait ... can't do that, because those commits are 1-4 specific ... great!
[05:51:49] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: sorry, nevermind... I now see I created /demos/ as subdirectory of /pages/ :(
[08:38:34] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ping
[08:40:51] <scott_gonzalez> pong
[08:42:17] <rxaviers> I had an initial idea of changing tests' resource loader as minimum as possible
[08:43:50] <rxaviers> but, I've changed a lot more in a way I had AMDfied tests.
[08:43:56] <rxaviers> https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/commit/e6887c974c0bc93acf37f4a86ebdb42b3ec5cfed
[08:44:02] <rxaviers> Is this too much change for what we need now?
[08:46:00] <rxaviers> The above updates accordion tests
[08:46:14] <rxaviers> file:///.../jquery-ui/tests/unit/accordion/accordion.html
[08:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> :-( AMD is so gross.
[08:49:32] <rxaviers> ahaha
[08:49:40] <rxaviers> Basically, the above shows it's possible to wrap tests using AMD. The benefit is more modular (and less global variable) tests.
[08:50:09] <rxaviers> I can try to wrap AMD on the current resource loader. Although, there are some nature differences. The first one is sync vs. async.
[08:54:21] <scott_gonzalez> Why can't the resource loader just become async?
[08:55:43] <rxaviers> I guess it can... I will make a second parallel change trying to be minimalistic about this change and let you know...
[08:55:52] <rxaviers> I just want to point out something...
[08:55:58] <rxaviers> One benefit of using AMD is cleaner code on one perspective: dependency trackage.  Previously, we had to specify all the dependencies on the HTML file by our own: https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/blob/0e3c322e2b354b7f594829c64b01e8d0cd4797ae/tests/unit/accordion/accordion.html#L15-L19
[08:56:39] <rxaviers> After using AMD on tests, at least we don't need to specify that on the html. But, in the place where it's used in fact. Eg:
[08:57:18] <rxaviers> On the HTML, we require one specific tests
[08:57:19] <rxaviers> https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/blob/e6887c974c0bc93acf37f4a86ebdb42b3ec5cfed/tests/unit/accordion/accordion.html#L141
[08:57:28] <scott_gonzalez> For the record, I don't consider AMD to be cleaner code.
[08:58:04] <rxaviers> inside the test code, it specifies its dependencies: https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/blob/e6887c974c0bc93acf37f4a86ebdb42b3ec5cfed/tests/unit/accordion/accordion_methods.js#L5
[08:58:11] <rxaviers> I understand.
[08:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> And I definitely don't think this belongs in individual tests: https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/blob/e6887c974c0bc93acf37f4a86ebdb42b3ec5cfed/tests/unit/accordion/accordion.html#L129-L140
[08:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> That config probably belongs in the helpers.
[08:59:35] <rxaviers> paths are a problem.. We could get rid of this if we consider (as a premise) the relative paths will be the same across all tests.
[08:59:53] <rxaviers> current testsuit.js does assume that. So, we could clean up that config stuff.
[09:00:21] <rxaviers> Yeap, assuming relative paths are the same, we could move that into helpers.
[09:00:51] <rxaviers> OK
[09:01:05] <rxaviers> We know how it would look like if we AMDfy it.
[09:01:16] <rxaviers> Let me work on the minimalistic change. Then, we compare both.
[09:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good. Thanks.
[09:01:34] <rxaviers> ;)
[09:01:34] <rxaviers> thanks

[10:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> When I saw the ticket, I just assumed it was a Win 8 issue.
[10:20:36] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah
[10:21:11] <tj_vantoll1> I tried in Windows 8 and 8.1 and it's fine so I'm going to close the ticket.

[10:26:00] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: Do you want to go through all the widgets and see which ones break on Win8?
[10:26:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you take care of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6794 ?
[10:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: Hmmm...I wonder if you need an actual touch device for things to break.
[10:27:16] <tj_vantoll1> I have a touch device.
[10:27:22] <tj_vantoll1> (a Windows 8.1 one)
[10:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> Does draggable fail on it?
[10:28:11] <tj_vantoll1> Hmmmm, hold on I can try.
[10:28:31] <uGoMobi> tj_vantoll1: I have two WP8 devices here if something needs to be tested
[10:29:29] <tj_vantoll1> scott_gonzalez: It does not work.
[10:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> It needs .ui-draggable { -ms-touch-action: none; }
[10:30:03] <scott_gonzalez> Can you check all the widgets and see which ones are failing?
[10:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> File an issue for them, and perhaps a PR that adds that rule for each failing widget.
[10:30:33] <tj_vantoll1> Will do. I g2g at the moment.
[10:30:45] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks. Just need this done before 1.11.
[10:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> We're getting close to having a legally clean history for UI :-) There are 24 commits by 17 authors who have not signed the CLA.
[10:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> We may need to back out some community contributions though :-/
[10:48:27] <manus> hey folks, I just said this in maybe the wrong channel (#jquery), but..  (pasting)
[10:48:48] <manus>  I got a quick probable-bug-or-inconsistency / maybe-undocumented-design-decision in jQuery UI, fiddle here : http://jsfiddle.net/gj5nZ/
[10:49:05] <manus>  Basically traced it to a "bad" regex: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/47db52b9c98a5c593eb86e5b75309568d11b3bef/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L417
[10:49:17] <manus> didn't want to nor have time to register for the forum, so reported it here.. need to run away now, but I'll come back to check the logs later
[10:49:43] <manus> any more questions about it, please feel free to send a thing to sa at mit period education
[10:49:56] <manus> thanks in advance! (and apologies for double-posting)
[10:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, it's a bug in UI.
[10:54:06] <manus> regex should probably be something more like:  /^([\w-]+)\s*(.*)$/  or, even better(?), something like:  /^([^\s]+)\s*(.*)$/
[10:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9708
[10:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather change it to [a-z_:-]+
[10:55:03] <scott_gonzalez> BTW [^\s] === \S
[10:55:32] <scott_gonzalez> People shouldn't be creating crazy event names.
[10:55:39] <scott_gonzalez> But dashes seem perfectly reasonable.
[10:56:09] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, minimal change here https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/commit/2ea146bd68fafde2a39a5bc432b0495cc66470f9#diff-1 Although, it's not working. I can't see why so far!?
[10:59:20] <scott_gonzalez> Why do the test files need to be deferred?
[10:59:44] <scott_gonzalez> Can't we just load QUnit syncrhonously, load the tests synchronously, and delay the start of QUnit?

[12:27:38] <gseguin> uGoMobi: So you want to put the demos that are currently on the website into the repo jquerymobile.com
[12:27:54] <gseguin> is that right?
[12:28:02] <gseguin> Monday afternoon only
[12:28:32] <gseguin> yeah sorry uGoMobi I had to grab food 
[12:29:07] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok, Monday afternoon is fine
[12:29:21] <gseguin> alright
[12:29:29] <uGoMobi> you are still in Boulder right?
[12:29:39] <gseguin> correct
[12:29:42] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:30:25] <uGoMobi> gseguin: adding /demos/ directory to the repo didn't work for me
[12:31:05] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I did that locally but Git didn't notice the change
[12:31:49] <uGoMobi> and when I tested links to /demos/1.4.0/ locally I got redirected to changelog/1.4.0/

[12:46:09] <agcolom> uGoMobi: re: redirect: me too! strange!
[12:46:41] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, I don't get it
[12:47:57] <agcolom> weird! http://local.jquerymobile.com/demos/ works but not when you then go to 1.4!
[12:48:17] <agcolom> or 1.3.2 or anyother one...
[12:48:23] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I have to set it up, I can't don it right now
[12:48:56] <uGoMobi> agcolom: did you added /demos/1.4.0/ locally?
[12:48:59] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok
[12:49:10] <uGoMobi> s/added/add/
[12:49:34] <agcolom> I did a pull earlier, so not sure whether it was there or not
[12:49:42] <agcolom> (when I did the changelog)
[12:50:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: then the directory is not there
[12:50:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I added it locally but Git is ignoring it
[12:50:35] <agcolom> No, I just have demo.html
[12:50:45] <agcolom> demos.html
[12:50:56] <uGoMobi> agcolom: right, I created a demo.html file under /pages/
[12:51:17] <uGoMobi> with links to /demos/1.4.0/ (and same for older versions)
[12:51:35] <agcolom> yes, I can see the lists of links
[12:51:48] <agcolom> only the master one works
[12:51:49] <uGoMobi> but the /demos/ directory should not be under /pages/
[12:52:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, that is an external link to view.*
[12:52:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: gseguin will look into it
[12:52:43] <agcolom> ok. 
[12:53:14] <agcolom> for changelog, we have changelog.html in pages and also the chagelog folder with then all the various logs
[12:53:27] <uGoMobi> right
[12:53:45] <agcolom> and it's the same for download
[12:53:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the difference is that those are just single files
[12:54:03] <agcolom> oh yes, correct
[12:55:02] <uGoMobi> if I add /pages/demos/1.4.0/ the wordpress build script is throwing errors
[12:56:07] <uGoMobi> and in the /pages/ directory should only be actual WordPress pages
[12:57:18] <scott_gonzalez> What are you trying to do?
[12:58:10] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: getting the 1.4 demos in jquerymobile/demos/1.4.0/
[12:58:20] <uGoMobi> and same for previous versions
[12:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> I realize that. How are you trying to do it?
[12:58:46] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: I tried to add /demos/ in the jquerymobile.com repo
[12:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> You mean /pages/demos.html?
[12:59:05] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: no
[12:59:14] <scott_gonzalez> Where did you try to add a demos directory?
[12:59:17] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: pages/demos.html is already there
[12:59:24] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: correct
[12:59:46] <scott_gonzalez> So you tried to add /pages/demos/ with files inside it?
[12:59:56] <scott_gonzalez> Like /pages/demos/1.4.0.html
[13:00:03] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: that's what I did first by mistake
[13:00:11] <uGoMobi> but I understand that's not the way to go
[13:00:14] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean by mistake?
[13:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> That's the only way to create pages.
[13:00:52] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: but that's the point, it shouldn't create pages of the files that are in the /demos/ folder
[13:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> The actual demos are resources, not pages.
[13:01:18] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: yes
[13:01:33] <scott_gonzalez> But you have /demos/ linking to /demos/1.4.0/, so that's not going to work unless you have /pages/demos/1.4.0.html
[13:01:41] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: so I tried to create a /demos/ directory as a sibling of the /resources/ directory
[13:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> And then 1.4.0.html needs to load those resources somehow.
[13:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> Why?
[13:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> That will be ignored.
[13:02:14] <uGoMobi> yeah I noticed
[13:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> You only have three things you can work with: posts, resources, taxonomies.
[13:02:39] <uGoMobi> I see
[13:03:24] <uGoMobi> now I understand the problem
[13:04:42] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: can't we handle this the same as the ThemeRoller, keeping it outside WordPress?
[13:05:19] <uGoMobi> just add the directory on the server
[13:05:48] <scott_gonzalez> Our infrastructure doesn't work that way.
[13:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> Notice that ThemeRoller doesn't exist on the current site: http://stage.jquerymobile.com/themeroller
[13:06:10] <scott_gonzalez> So whatever you think is working isn't.
[13:06:34] <uGoMobi> I see
[13:07:14] <uGoMobi> ok we will look into a way to make it work from the resources directory
[13:07:44] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ^^^
[13:08:43] <gseguin> so demos should be a child of resources ?
[13:08:46] <gseguin> is that right?
[13:08:58] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah
[13:09:28] <uGoMobi> gseguin: and we should have a directory /pages/demos/
[13:09:39] <gseguin> can we proxy jquerymobile.com/demos to jquerymobile/resources/demos ?
[13:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> no
[13:09:50] <uGoMobi> gseguin: with a html file for each version
[13:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, technically yes, but we shouldn't be making exceptions like this.
[13:10:50] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: that was to expose the same paths than on the current website
[13:10:54] <gseguin> but that's fine
[13:11:08] <scott_gonzalez> The current site doesn't even have demos.
[13:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> They're all on view.
[13:11:15] <gseguin> uGoMobi: oh we need one page per demo? why?
[13:11:42] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: nope: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.4.0-rc.1/
[13:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> If you want a demo site, we can probably setup demos.jquerymobile.com as just a standard site, not using WordPress.
[13:12:19] <gseguin> I dont think that's using view.
[13:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> How do you find that URL?
[13:12:39] <uGoMobi> yeah, I am surprised too
[13:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> Because jquerymobile.com's menu doesn't linkt o that.
[13:13:08] <gseguin> We use to expose it and then we stopped
[13:13:36] <gseguin> if you check in the old blog posts we were exposing demos at these urls I believe
[13:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> How old?
[13:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> Even 1.2.1 links to view.
[13:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/03/22/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-2-1/
[13:14:09] <gseguin> don't remember
[13:14:20] <scott_gonzalez> 1.0.1 links to jquerymobile.com
[13:14:30] <gseguin> but the demos directory contains pretty much all versions
[13:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> 1.1.2 links to view.
[13:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we shouldn't put that at jquerymobile.com/demos/
[13:14:56] <scott_gonzalez> If it's going to not be inside the standard theme, it should be it's own site.
[13:15:06] <gseguin> I like the idea of demos.jquerymobile.com/<semver>
[13:15:26] <uGoMobi> let's stop with using other infrastructure than other projects if not really needed
[13:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to talk to infra about getting that setup.
[13:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> But if you're going to have a complete demo system that uses full pages, and you want them for all versions, then a separate site seems like the way to go.
[13:16:09] <uGoMobi> I am not sure if I am in favor
[13:16:18] <uGoMobi> also like to be consistent with UI
[13:16:43] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there are two big issues with being consistent with UI for demos.
[13:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> 1) That's a ton of work for Mobile, with little benefit.
[13:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> 2) We don't even like our own demo setup.
[13:17:14] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: what are UI's plans with demos? do you also want to add "real-world" demos in the future?
[13:17:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[13:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/59810840/Demos
[13:18:11] <gseguin> uGoMobi: A demos.jquerymobile.com site seems to be the easiest way to do it
[13:18:31] <scott_gonzalez> And it makes sense if you're doing versioned demos.
[13:18:38] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah
[13:19:50] <gseguin> uGoMobi: Will you talk with infra about setting that up?
[13:20:48] <uGoMobi> I wasn't against the idea of demos.jquerymobile.com, just want us to get from that island where we were doing many things different than the other projects
[13:21:03] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes, I will ask them
[13:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> Having sub-sites that operate on their own is ok.
[13:21:22] <scott_gonzalez> Just like download builder.
[13:21:24] <gseguin> uGoMobi: totally agree
[13:21:37] <scott_gonzalez> But within a WordPress site, everything needs to be done the standard way.
[13:21:41] <gseguin> but yeah it's sort of justified here
[13:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> And whenver possible, sites should be WordPress sites.
[13:22:02] <scott_gonzalez> But for the types of demos you have, it makes sense to create a separate site.
[13:22:17] <gseguin> And the demos typically don't need to inherit the styles of the content sites
[13:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> They're full page, separate branding, etc.
[13:22:19] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[13:22:24] <gseguin> so no real point
[13:22:38] <gseguin> I think we all agree here
[13:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> You will need to resolve the ThemeRoller issue though.
[13:22:46] <scott_gonzalez> Should be very simple.
[13:22:53] <uGoMobi> we could do the same
[13:22:59] <gseguin> YAY! to being in agreement!
[13:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> Whowever was working on that (I know arschmitz has asked me some questions about it), can ping me about it.
[13:24:00] <uGoMobi> cool
[13:24:12] <gseguin> uGoMobi: keep me in the loop about the demos repo
[13:24:21] <gseguin> I can populate it once it's up
[13:24:22] <uGoMobi> gseguin: will do
[13:26:32] <uGoMobi> grrr... was about to order a Nexus 5 but during this demos convo the status changed to out of stock :/
[13:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[13:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> We've got async communication here. You should've ordered and made us wait :-)
[13:28:33] <uGoMobi> yeah I learned from it :)
[13:29:26] <scott_gonzalez> I had a product go from one in stock to out of stock during my account creation (no guest checkout) the other week.
[13:31:40] <uGoMobi> makes you wonder if it could also happen between payment and confirmation
[13:49:17] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15nathany opened issue #6801: Text area disappearing in Chrome and JQM 1.4.0 02http://git.io/SKEDtQ
[13:54:52] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Windows 8 tickets created. Slider and the interactions are as simple as adding { touch-action: none; }. I need to do some more testing and I'll send a PR. Tooltip is weird though.
[13:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> Saw the tickets.
[13:56:01] <scott_gonzalez> What's up with tooltip
[13:56:33] <agcolom> uGoMobi: does the content need the role="content" (the person who just opened a ticket only uses <div class="ui-content">
[13:56:54] <tj_vantoll> It just never shows up unless you literally hold your finger down on the <input>.
[13:57:15] <tj_vantoll> I'm guessing a mouseout event is fired that instantly hides it.
[13:57:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I just updated our JS Bin today to use class="ui-content"
[13:57:22] <tj_vantoll> Just guessing though.
[13:57:36] <tj_vantoll> We already have a separate problem with tooltip on iOS.
[13:57:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: data-role="content" has been deprecated but still works in 1.4
[13:58:04] <agcolom> oh, sorry I meant role="main"
[13:58:23] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[13:58:52] <tj_vantoll> Looks like I get to create jquery.ui.draggable.css and jquery.ui.sortable.css.
[13:59:23] <tj_vantoll> Fun.
[13:59:35] <tj_vantoll> Anyways I'm heading out. I should have a PR ready tomorrow sometime.
[13:59:55] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I thought we were using <div role="main" class="ui-content">
[14:00:06] <agcolom> is role="main" optional? 
[14:02:43] <agcolom> also, we use core 1.10.2? 
[14:02:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, it's an ARIA role
[14:02:58] <agcolom> oh ok
[14:03:01] <agcolom> thanks
[14:03:22] <agcolom> so we keep this in the demos and code examples then
[14:03:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we add role="main" if you use data-role="content", otherwise you can add it yourself
[14:03:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: and 1.10.2 is correct
[14:03:47] <agcolom> ok, thanks. 
[14:03:51] <agcolom> perfect :-)
[14:43:18] <gringochapin> Hi all. I believe I've found a bug in menus, but wanted to run it by folks here first, to get some first impressions and opinions, before filing.  It's pretty simple.  It appears that if you have a hidden menu item, and you are navigating through that menu via the keyboard, hidden items are not skipped.  Seems like the fix for this would be to simply filter the menu items with ':visible' selecter, before focusing the
[14:43:18] <gringochapin> next/previous/first/last item.  Thoughts?
[15:04:13] <scott_gonzalez> Seems reasonable.
[16:21:30] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell tj_vantoll touch-action on handles only, not the whole element
[16:21:30] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I’ll tell tj_vantoll about that.
