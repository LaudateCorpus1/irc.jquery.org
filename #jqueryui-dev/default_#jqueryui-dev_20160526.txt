[13:43:41] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i tried updating 1.5 dev with latest ui
[13:43:50] <arschmitz> but then i realized you have done that in your pr
[13:44:03] <arschmitz> with a bunch of file name changes and stuff compared to current 1.5dev
[13:44:12] <arschmitz> so it would have blown up your pr for no good reason
[13:44:23] <arschmitz> best if you just run it in your branch
[13:57:33] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[13:57:50] <gabrielschulhof> I see that you've landed the controlgroup changes in UI.
[13:58:20] <gabrielschulhof> So, do I grab from the tip of master?

[16:18:18] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: There's a problem with UI core. It assumes that define() is defined.
[16:19:02] <gabrielschulhof> It should do the whole if ( typeof define === "function" && define.amd ) { ... }
[16:19:14] <gabrielschulhof> So, it's breaking our index.php
[16:19:21] <gabrielschulhof> Though wait - maybe if I don't include it.
[16:19:57] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, OK. NM. I just skip it from js/index.php
[16:40:00] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: ui core should no be included
[16:40:12] <arschmitz> thats just a refrence to other files its just for bckcompat
[16:40:16] <arschmitz> it should not be used anywhere
[16:40:49] <arschmitz> its only for there for people that were doing require( "core" )
