[05:47:14] <scott_gonzalez> Haha, that's awesome.
[05:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> I know why that happened too.
[05:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> The events site has <img><h4>name</h4><img><h4>name</h4><img><h4>name</h4>
[05:48:13] <scott_gonzalez> And you're right before me, so the header before my image has your name.

[13:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Just filed a bunch of issues for the API site.
[13:27:05] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! just saw your issue 25 (replace <p> with <div>). Should I also do that on the api.jquerymobile.com?
[13:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Ideally we'd use the same file.
[13:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know of any differences?
[13:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> I filed the issue because we're generating invalid markup on api.jqueryui.com
[13:28:02] <agcolom> you mean the xslt file?
[13:28:05] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:28:43] <agcolom> Ah, I made some changes at the beginning... I thought I could do what I wanted with it!
[13:29:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll look through the changes you made.
[13:29:15] <agcolom> nothing major... it was not picking up something, so I had to add it.
[13:29:47] <agcolom> I thought the thing about replacing <p> with <div> was in the xml files
[13:29:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get to a point where there's only one copy of this so that we don't have to worry about keeping any fixes/changes in sync.
[13:30:08] <agcolom> sure. Good idea.
[13:30:29] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that the XSL does this: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L79
[13:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> But then we do stuff like this in the XML: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries/accordion.xml#L34
[13:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> So we end up with <p>...<ul>...</ul></p>
[13:31:50] <agcolom> sure. I've got lots of <p> in my <desc>
[13:32:09] <agcolom> should they be removed? (in the xml file) and replaced by <div>?)
[13:32:20] <scott_gonzalez> You can keep them in the XML file.
[13:32:30] <scott_gonzalez> The concern is that there's <p> in the XSL.
[13:32:40] <agcolom> really?
[13:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L79
[13:33:13] <agcolom> yes!
[13:33:45] <agcolom> so should I do nothing at the moment and then we'll merge our xsl files? (to have just one?)
[13:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[13:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'll file an issue for that too :-p
[13:35:42] <agcolom> also Todd was keen to have the demos inline, so I'm adding that now... It looks quite nice I think... so I am not sure what the final demo is going to have... (just the demo for the code above I suppose?) But that's not in the xsl yet (I think you've filed an issue for that too?)
[13:36:05] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/31
[13:36:06] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #31 on api.jqueryui.com (scottgonzalez;  ago): Merge XSL with jQuery Mobile
[13:36:16] <agcolom> Thank you :-)
[13:36:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, the current api.jquery.com alreayd has an implementation for that.
[13:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> We need to pull that into the new sites.
[13:37:00] <scott_gonzalez> The XSL that we're using actually generates the placeholder content for the inline demos.
[13:37:08] <scott_gonzalez> We just don't have the JS in place for it yet.
[13:38:31] <agcolom> oh does it? Am I doing it wrong then?
[13:38:58] <agcolom> (my problem is that the demos need jqm libraries)
[13:39:31] <agcolom> but the site itself shouldn't have the jqm libraries, so I've had  to use iframes...
[13:39:47] <agcolom> is that ok?
[13:39:52] <scott_gonzalez> The demos will always run in iframes.
[13:40:31] <agcolom> right... I've done all this from scratch because I couldn't find anything equivalent in UI...
[13:40:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jquery.com/attr/#entry-examples
[13:41:31] <agcolom> I suppose the code for the demos will always be reusable...
[13:41:55] <agcolom> here's one of my examples: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/radio-button/
[13:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> yeah: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L240
[13:46:08] <agcolom> I think this is different to what I've done...
[13:46:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez - hey - so my work wants to use a datepicker in the style of the mask/spinner timepicker i did
[13:46:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do you have any opinion on me adding it to the mask branch in ui?
[13:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'd rather you create a new branch from the mask branch.
[13:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> I don't want history for a widget that's not on the roadmap in a branch that we plan on merging.
[13:47:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i was also thinking about calling the widgets .timemask() and .datemask() instead of "picker"
[13:48:20] <gnarf> just to avoid the clash with "datepicker"
[13:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> seems fine
[13:51:50] <gnarf> man, mask is way out of date :)
[13:54:50] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: in JQM we have many inline examples that are spread throughout the overview...
