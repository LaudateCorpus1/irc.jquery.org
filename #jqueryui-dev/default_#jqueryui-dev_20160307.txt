[04:10:00] <mdhr> Hi, I'd like to apply for GSoC at jQuery for the project titled "Prototype JavaScript transition module" for jQuery Mobile. Could someone please help me out with how I should proceed?
[07:27:23] <arschmitz> mdhr: i would start by familiarizing yourself with jQuery Mobile if you have not already
[07:27:28] <arschmitz> and how the current transitions work
[08:51:35] <mdhr> arschmitz: Thanks. I'm going through the files at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/js/transitions, which is where I think the current transitions are written. So I guess the project in particular involves switching over from CSS to the jQuery Animate function for these transitions?
[09:47:17] <arschmitz> mdhr: exactly
[09:47:37] <arschmitz> mdhr: it might be worth looking at the jquery ui effects as a starting point too
