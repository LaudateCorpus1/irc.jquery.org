[00:39:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[00:39:18] <uGoMobi> morning _|Nix|_ 
[00:39:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[00:39:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Since flipswitch is now a widget on its own, I should remove the portions of slider.xml that document its flipswitch function, right?
[00:40:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, in general, should I remove documentation for stuff that's deprecated?
[00:40:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, not yet
[00:40:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in API docs we have to add deprecated note
[00:40:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[00:40:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can do.
[00:41:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure if there is a format/class for that already
[00:41:20] <uGoMobi> to style those deprecated warnings the same across the API docs
[00:42:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, there's always <strong>Note: This method/option/whatever is deprecated as of 1.4.0 and will be removed in 1.5.0. See <someplace> instead.</strong>
[00:42:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in the demos we can remove exampes that use deprecated features already
[00:42:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we already did.
[00:43:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Another thought I had: If dialogs are now deep-linkable, then the sequence page -> dialog -> page <- back will take you back to the dialog.
[00:44:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[00:44:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and is that OK?
[00:45:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think it's a problem
[00:46:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can always use popup
[00:47:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I guess, since dialog is deprecated, people can continue to use it during 1.4.0 and move to popup in the meantime.
[00:47:27] <uGoMobi> exactly
[00:48:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think this highlights the fact that we need a generic data-reachable="true/false" for links.
[00:48:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or, rather data-deep-link="true/false"
[00:49:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The fact that a URL is deep-linkable or not should depend on what kind of a thing it points to.
[00:49:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That is: page is /always/ deep-linkable, dialog is /never/ deep-linkable, popup is /never/ deep-linkable, etc.
[00:49:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but what would that option do exactly?
[00:49:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It would create a non-deep-linkable URL.
[00:49:59] <uGoMobi> ah I see
[00:50:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and it would cause that entry to be skipped in urlHistory.
[00:50:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just like &ui-state=dialog, except it's implemented in such a way that it's widget-independent.
[00:51:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, /any/ link can be made non-deep-linkable.
[00:54:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: isn't this more about the widget than about the link?
[01:07:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I guess it depends on how you look at it. Basically, a link can lead to one of two widgets: a page, or a popup. Currently, a page is deep-linkable, but a popup is not.
[01:07:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Furthermore, we use data-rel to indicate what it is.
[01:08:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But data-rel basically indicates whether to make the link deep-linkable or not.
[01:10:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, whether we implement the process of deep-linkability on the link or on the widget, it would be beneficial to have it in one place.
[01:10:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That would make for a clearly defined feature: We support non-deep-linkable destinations.
[01:10:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and here's how you navigate to one: <the solution>.
[01:11:11] <_|Nix|_> I'll BBL.
[01:11:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, centralizing might be good idea, also because we have to look into nav for panel as well
[01:12:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: would be nice if popup and panel use the same logic
[01:12:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we don't use data-rel for panel yet by the way
[02:02:00] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - git core build #502: STILL UNSTABLE in 1 min 2 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/502/
[02:02:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we should stop using data-rel altogether.
[02:03:02] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI 1-9-stable - git core build #290: STILL UNSTABLE in 1 min 2 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%20git%20core/290/
[02:03:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: also data-rel="back" ?
[02:03:55] <_|Nix|_> Aaaah, that's right. We might wanna keep that. Can't really do without that.
[02:04:27] <_|Nix|_> But, like, data-rel="<widget>" we may be able to do without.
[02:05:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that would be nice
[02:05:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Definitely something to look into after 1.4.0.
[02:06:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, another API question: fixedtoolbar is gone, right? We now only have toolbar.
[02:07:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: fixedtoolbar.xml should go into toolbar.xml, right?
[02:07:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, popup would be the only one using it and we can look into doing without
[02:07:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nope
[02:07:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: fixedToolbar.js still exists
[02:08:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, but it's an extension on toolbar.
[02:08:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's another thing we need to figure out: How to document that it's an extension.
[02:09:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, it's an extension
[02:09:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Currently, our only option is to document the widget and all its extensions in one entry.
[02:10:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am fine with document them in one entry but we should make clear it depends on the extension
[02:10:32] <uGoMobi> for people that use the download builder
[02:11:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you discussed this with arschmitz_ already for autogrow, right? 
[02:12:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what did he suggest?
[02:12:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, with scott_gonzalez ...
[02:12:17] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[02:12:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can use includes.
[02:12:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But there's no special support for extensions otherwise.
[02:12:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  separate file but on one page in API docs?
[02:13:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[02:13:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, an extension might require multiple files, because you have multiple points of inclusion.
[02:14:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: One file for <longdesc>, one file for <options>, and one file for <methods>
[02:14:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[02:14:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and if the extension has events, then another one for <events>
[02:14:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, and you might wanna have another one for <examples>
[02:15:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno ... what if we treat it as a separate widget, and we put a link right at the top that points to the base widget?
[02:15:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and what is the benefit compared to everything in one XML file?
[02:15:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, it's organized logically.
[02:15:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if you change something in the extension, you don't need to search through the documentation for the whole widget.
[02:16:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true, but only extensions would use multiple files for methods, events, etc
[02:17:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think we should do that
[02:17:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The other choice then is to treat every extension as a widget on its onw.
[02:18:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_::we might move more things into extensions
[02:18:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: meaning people will not see an  option anymore in new version of API docs
[02:18:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually that would not be so bad: Example URL: http://api.jquerymobile.com/popup.arrow/
[02:21:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The thing about having all extensions on one page is that it would give a really coloured structure: <longdesc><base>...</base><ext1>...</ext1><ext2>...</ext2>...</longdesc><options><base>...</base><ext1>...</ext1><ext2>...</ext2>...</options><events><base>...</base><ext1>...</ext1><ext2>...</ext2>...</events>
[02:21:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think it will become harder for people to get a good overview of what they can do with a widget
[02:21:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right. It's a tradeoff.
[02:22:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how about on one page but include underneath eachother
[02:23:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so we can still have the extension in one file
[02:23:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't understand. Like this? <base><longdesc></longdesc><options></options><events></events></base><ext1>...</ext1><ext2>...</ext2>?
[02:24:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This might be possible. I need to check whether the XSL can deal with more than one <options> section.
[02:25:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that was indeed what I meant
[02:25:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good point, don't know if it's possible
[02:25:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just one problem: An entry has a table at the top listing all the options/methods/events.
[02:26:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: my idea was to have anther table like that for the extension
[02:26:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I dunno how that table would deal with having multiple options sections, and I'm certain it won't be able to subdivide things by extension.
[02:26:41] <uGoMobi> ohw :(
[02:26:56] <uGoMobi> oh, you mean subdivide within the table
[02:26:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, basically, as if an extension was a separate widget, but concatenating the resulting HTML.
[02:27:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Subdivide /somehow/, IDK if within the table or not.
[02:27:19] <uGoMobi> I meant having a second table for the extension after the first entry
[02:27:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, at that point it's a separate widget, but the HTML files are concatenated.
[02:28:17] <uGoMobi> right
[02:28:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In that case, however, we'd wanna have another table at the top listing the extensions documented in the present page.
[02:28:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's discuss with agcolom and scott_gonzalez 
[02:28:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Another option is to treat every widget as a category.
[02:29:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: will give you a long menu at the left
[02:29:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: And then have entries like "Basic", "Arrow", or "Basic", "Autodividers", "Hide Dividers"
[02:29:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, so what? jQuery has an enormous menu at the left.
[02:29:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Search can help then.
[02:29:52] <uGoMobi> true
[02:30:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and remember - only the part of the menu that is relevant to the widget you're interested in is open.
[02:30:15] <uGoMobi> yeah, not saying it's a bad idea
[02:30:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what I want to improve is to give good overview of what JQM is and offers
[02:30:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course, if you want an option, you dunno which extension will give you that option until you've clicked on (at worst) all extensions in the left menu.
[02:31:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: global options, methods, events, widgets
[02:31:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly. Doing it the category way will not give you such an overview.
[02:31:08] <uGoMobi> etc
[02:31:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If we put it in one file, we still need to visually group extensions within that file.
[02:31:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Otherwise ppl dunno which extension offers which options.
[02:32:22] <uGoMobi> true
[02:32:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, if we do it the subcategory way, ppl dunno which options the widget has.
[02:33:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, we may be able to do it using some wordpress magic.
[02:33:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We do subcategories, but they are just anchors inside a big page documenting the whole widget.
[02:34:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we have like Popup -> { Basic, Arrows }, but we have only one popup page. Basic goes to the top, and Arrows points right after basic.
[02:34:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that might be a good one
[02:34:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In that case, we need support from wordpress, and we need support for basically multiple widgets on one page.
[02:35:01] <uGoMobi> only link to extension from it's parent widget page
[02:35:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, but with in-page links, right?
[02:36:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I thought you meant separate page, but on same page is basically what I suggested too
[02:36:15] <uGoMobi> but we don't know if that's possible
[02:36:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, we don't.
[02:37:02] <uGoMobi> I am in favor of having them on one page and only listing the main widgets
[02:37:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, then we have to figure out if we can have multiple option/event/method tables on one page.
[02:38:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... unless you want to merge all options/events/methods into one table.
[02:38:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, we could just add text saying "This option is provided by the autogrow extension."
[02:39:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, people can still treat it as though /all/ options were part of the widget, and then they can check the documentation text to know exactly which extension provides the given option/method/event.
[02:39:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and internally, we can break it up into multiple files which all get included.
[02:41:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[02:41:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like popup/{longdesc,events,methods,options}/{base.xml,arrow.xml} and then we have entries/popup.xml which is basically a list of <include> tags.
[02:41:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we also have to make it clear in the data- attribute reference
[02:42:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In the API docs the fact that an options is available as a data-attribute is documented in the option.
[02:43:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we have a separate data- attribute reference page
[02:43:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, drat.
[02:44:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, it doesn't kill this idea. We simply have to maintain it :/
[02:45:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's bad that we document a widget option in two places.
[02:45:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, just wanted to mention it so we don't forget
[02:45:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes that's bad
[02:45:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: People should understand that /all/ widget options are available as data attributes.
[02:45:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's nice to provide an overview
[02:46:03] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.6.x core build #398: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.6.x%20core/398/
[02:46:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno ... I think a flat list of data attributes would be overwhelming.
[02:46:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but would be nice if that overview was generated automatically
[02:46:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, we can work on that, but I think that's a separate task from addressing widget extensions.
[02:47:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: "People should understand that /all/ widget options are available as data attributes" I don't think we can approach it like that
[02:47:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: people won't know where to put the dash etc
[02:47:26] <uGoMobi> we have to document them
[02:47:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I didn't mean we shouldn't document them.
[02:47:57] <uGoMobi> but doing that in the description and in the reference is what I don't like
[02:48:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I meant we should document them under widget options.
[02:48:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that might be better
[02:49:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: although it might be useful to have one reference open when you write your markup
[02:49:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, that's what we're doing now. /All/ our <option> entries have a <p>This option is also available as a data- attribute: <code>data-option-name="value"</code>.</p>
[02:49:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[02:49:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and we will always forget to update something when we change or add an option
[02:50:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno ... Are options related to other widgets really useful when you're trying to decide what options to give your current widget?
[02:50:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you're in the process of creating a collapsible, what use is it having options for fixedtoolbar on the same page?
[02:51:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I am not sure either
[02:51:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We have data-* attributes that are not options for any widget.
[02:51:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then it's bad if they are only listed in the reference
[02:52:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think if the data attributes page has a paragraph at the top explaining that each widget has its own data-* attributes which coincide with the widget's options, and then a list of non-widget data attributes, that should suffice.
[02:52:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then it's not a reference
[02:53:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so we can do that, but would have to name it differently
[02:53:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so I guess you want more like an index ...
[02:53:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I get it now.
[02:54:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: personally I am ok with just listing them on the widget page, and the "non-option-data-attributes" on some other page
[02:54:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think so too.
[02:54:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just not sure if there are many people that find it handy to have a reference where we list them all
[02:55:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah - I'm not sure either.
[02:59:45] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... I have to finish this theme-swatch pass. It's quite a drag :/
[03:02:40] <_|Nix|_> Oh, well, NM ... I just finished it :)

[04:45:13] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[04:45:29] <uGoMobi> frequent: pong
[04:46:17] <frequent> uGoMobi: back from short holiday and already have two questions:
[04:46:47] <frequent> should there be a pagebeforeshow triggered when going back from page X to the anchor page?
[04:46:58] <frequent> anchor page = first page being loaded
[04:47:03] <uGoMobi> frequent: hope you had a nice holiday
[04:47:22] <frequent> uGoMobi: ... got sick when I left and am back healthy for work :-)
[04:47:27] <frequent> but was nice still
[04:47:30] <uGoMobi> :/
[04:50:35] <uGoMobi> frequent: I would expect a pagebeforeshow event yes
[04:50:58] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. I'm missing it. Will make a JSBin.
[04:51:20] <frequent> and see if it's me...
[04:51:53] <frequent> if I may also poke you with this:
[04:52:26] <frequent> I'm trying to load a panel dynamically with the panel open/close button being loaded inside another dynamically loaded element (header)
[04:53:13] <frequent> everything loads ok and I can open/close the panel programmatically, but clicking the <a href="#mypanel"></a> button does not work
[04:54:17] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah, doesn't surprise me
[04:54:19] <frequent> so question would be if it's at all possible to load components of a single gadget (panel + button) with 2 different dynamically loaded elements
[04:56:39] <uGoMobi> frequent: it's because the _handleClick method in panel.js is called during create
[04:57:07] <frequent> uGoMobi: mh.
[04:58:41] <uGoMobi> actually the binding is done in _bindLinkListeners
[04:58:58] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok (sifting through code)
[04:59:03] <uGoMobi> anyways... can you enhance the panel after generating the header?
[04:59:14] <frequent> mh. good idea
[04:59:24] <frequent> theoretically yes
[05:01:01] <frequent> uGoMobi: let me have a look. I also like the idea in filterable of just providing the "related" element identifier hardcoded (data-input). 
[05:01:18] <frequent> let's see what I find. Thanks so far!

[05:15:08] <frequent> uGoMobi: just mentioning,     this._on( "a", { "click": "_handleClick"});    inside _bindLinkListeners() will bind to every button and test for panel-id. Seems like a lot of binding-overhead.

[06:45:37] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #143 by gabrielschulhof (2w 1d ago): button: Update instructions for specifying a custom icon given grunticon
[06:45:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 144 is about double scrollbars in FF and now in Chrome too.
[06:46:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure, will take a look
[06:46:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[06:47:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm implementing includes for option disabled, the create event, and the destroy, disable, enable, and option methods.
[06:47:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: about Grunticon
[06:47:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was thinking maybe we shouldn't document it yet
[06:47:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but add a demo with the load script
[06:48:09] <uGoMobi> and tell people the CSS files are in the ZIP and CDN
[06:48:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I just figured that something might have changed in the way custom icons need to be created. If the old method still works, feel free to close that bug.
[06:48:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: custom icons still work in the demos
[06:48:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but that's probably because I updated something
[06:48:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will update the custom icon example
[06:49:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's not really Grunticon related
[06:50:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. If the instructions given in the API docs continue to be correct, then I will close https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/143.

[06:52:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I suppose we show CSS there that needs to be updated because we use :after now
[06:53:03] <_|Nix|_> Riiiight. True!

[11:22:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Currently we document buttonMarkup and the button widget together. Should I split that up?
[11:22:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[11:22:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Can do.
[11:22:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: buttonMarkup should be listed under methods
[11:23:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is an open ticket for this in the API issue tracker, can you close that with your commit?
[11:23:55] <uGoMobi> s/API/API docs/
[11:25:13] <uGoMobi> thanks
[11:25:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[11:26:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: D000d ... this is a monster task ... wow! I don't mean the buttonMarkup splitup, but the whole API docs thing. ... and quite a different kind of work from coding, too ...
[11:27:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm surprised I actually have the patience to do this :)
[11:27:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I know
[11:27:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: really happy you are working on that!
[11:27:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and should be the last time we do it like this
[11:28:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: everyone should update API docs while or right after making changes in the library
[11:28:38] <_|Nix|_> Truer words were never spoken ...
[11:29:03] <uGoMobi> same for demos, because updating those takes quite some time too
[11:29:41] <uGoMobi> even if people do a PR we should ask to also create a PR for updating the API docs if applicable
[11:30:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Agreed.
[11:30:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess if we merge the PR we should create an API ticket and ask the submitter of the PR to fix it in a commit.
[11:31:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, good idea
[11:31:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then we can merge the API PR and close both the PR and the ticket.
[11:31:22] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:31:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and if the submitter does not create an API PR, we'll have a ticket which we know we need to close.
[11:34:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: added it to my notes for new contributing.md, the sections about PR's
[11:34:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[11:34:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez_: Ping!
[11:34:47] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Ping!
[11:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> pong
[11:35:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: <entry type="????">...</entry> for a jQuery plugin - that is, for $.fn.buttonMarkup()?
[11:35:34] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Is it just type="method"?
[11:35:46] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[11:35:49] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK.
[11:35:57] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Thanks!
[11:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[11:36:16] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and the name is jQuery.fn.buttonMarkup?
[11:36:42] <scott_gonzalez> No, the name is buttonMarkup.
[11:36:46] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK.
[11:37:02] <scott_gonzalez> And the file name is buttonMarkup.xml
[11:37:14] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Right. How do I say that it returns this.
[11:37:16] <_|Nix|_> ?
[11:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> return="jQuery"
[11:37:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Awesome! Thanks!
[11:38:11] <scott_gonzalez> You realize there are tons of existing files to use as references, right?
[11:39:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I'm looking at entries/addClass.xml from UI.
[11:39:49] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Just wasn't sure since this is the first time I document a jQuery plugin.
[11:40:10] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and since the mobile examples are all jQuery.mobile.methodName()
[11:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> All jQuery.fn methods are written as .methodName(). Always, on all sites.
[11:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> All other methods are written as their full name.
[11:41:57] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, I'm seeing <title>.addClass()</title> in addClass.xml

[14:34:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just realized: If a <button> is not a button widget, you cannot enable/disable it using the widget API, and buttonMarkup will ignore the disabled attribute.
[14:34:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if you use <button> widgets, you pretty much have to write the disabling code yourself.
[14:35:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, .prop( "disabled", isDisabled ).toggleClass( "ui-state-disabled", isDisabled );
[14:35:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We should document that in buttonMarkup.
[15:08:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Done.
