[00:30:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! I was wondering if you could review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7398 ... I've added a demo showing a selectmenu with a placeholder.
[00:30:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great! will do
[00:31:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I've discovered something strange. When there's a placeholder and the selectmenu comes up as a dialog, the title of the dialog is taken from the label associated with the selectmenu, not from the placeholder.
[00:31:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, can we move https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7396 up to 1.4.3? After all, this demo affects 1.4.x as much as it will affect 1.5.0.
[00:33:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure, we can land it in 1.4.3 (just changed the milestone)
[00:33:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I've discovered another thing, which I've mentioned on arschmitz's page event rewrite. The code for the demo would be unnecessarily complicated if I were to use non-deprecated page event handlers.
[00:34:05] <_|Nix|_> So, when arschmitz lands his page event changes, we should also change this demo. I've filed an issue about that.
[00:34:32] <uGoMobi> ok
[00:35:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the issue with the dialog title will be gone when we stop using a dialog for custom selectmenu in 1.5
[00:35:30] <uGoMobi> so I would leave that for now
[00:35:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess.
[00:36:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: unless it's a simple fix of course
[00:36:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Still ... might be nice to fall back to the placeholder if there's no label.
[00:36:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll see if the fix is simple.
[00:37:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, it's inconsistent. The popup uses the placeholder item for a title, but the dialog doesn't.
[00:38:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess it kinda makes sense though, because when the dialog is visible, you can't see the rest of the form, so you might want to show the label, because that's probably more generic than the placeholder.
[00:38:24] <_|Nix|_> Like: Destination: Select city...
[00:38:54] <_|Nix|_> If you show the dialog and it says "Select city..." then you're like "Wait! Was this the departure or the destination city?"
[00:39:22] <_|Nix|_> Still, it shouldn't be a problem in a properly designed form, but the fallback would be nice.
[00:39:29] <_|Nix|_> Now I'm just thinking out-lout.
[00:39:32] * _|Nix|_ shuts up
[00:39:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when it opens as a popup on a mobile screen you probably don't see a lot of the form either
[00:39:54] <uGoMobi> it has to be consistent
[00:40:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes you do, because the popup has about the same width as the selectmenu button, and so the label shows up next to it.
[00:40:35] <_|Nix|_> ... and the popup is centred over the selectmenu button.
[00:41:19] <uGoMobi> if you use field container the select button will be below the label on small screens
[00:41:35] <_|Nix|_> Yes, I guess so, in which case you won't see the label either.
[00:41:49] <uGoMobi> and it also depends on the lenght of the content in the selectmenu
[00:41:58] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[00:42:21] <_|Nix|_> OK ... so ... use the placeholder?
[00:42:26] <uGoMobi> yeah
[00:42:33] <_|Nix|_> Alright.
[00:42:35] <uGoMobi> and if not defined, no title
[00:42:39] <_|Nix|_> OK.

[00:55:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't see that dialog title issue http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/159
[00:56:03] <_|Nix|_> Interesting. It's only happening on firefox.
[00:56:12] <_|Nix|_> Wow!
[00:56:20] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'll investigate further.
[00:57:50] <_|Nix|_> So, that changes the equation a bit.
[00:59:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, but like I said, it's not worth it to invest too much time in this issue because we will stop using the dialog
[01:44:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know, but I'm curious as to why things are different on FF.
[01:55:22] <ruz_34> hi all
[01:55:50] <ruz_34> i'm looking for some help on what must be a common issue with tabs...
[01:56:48] <ruz_34> anyone around to help?
[02:04:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The issue you're not seeing is reproducible if you open http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/159 in a sufficiently large window to cause it to appear as a popup, then open it as a popup, then resize the window to be small enough so it appears as a dialog, then open it as a dialog.
[02:04:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, this is a genuine bug.
[02:05:21] <_|Nix|_> ... a low priority one, but a bug nonetheless.
[02:08:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I think it just gained a measure of priority. When we set the text of the header during _decideFormat(), we're opening ourselves up to an XSS vulnerability: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2547. We should be using self.label.getEncodedText() not self.label.text().
[02:09:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: johnbender explains better in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2550

[06:22:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: Holy shitsu! Trying to create a select menu with a weird ID, like <select id="the-select['x']">, breaks both the select, the popup, and the page upon loading.
[06:22:58] <_|Nix|_> There are so many places where we're not escaping selectors ..
[06:23:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we are not escaping the selector
[06:23:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we had similar issue with checkbox
[06:23:15] <_|Nix|_> Nope. Not in selectmenu, not in popup.
[06:23:17] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[06:23:37] <_|Nix|_> But this is disheartening. It's like the library is unraveling before my eyes.
[06:23:50] <_|Nix|_> I thought I had it fixed when I fixed it in selectmenu. Boy was I wrong :/
[06:24:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i would say usage is pretty rare considdering the lack of issues
[06:25:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... I'm tempted to just re-milestone https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7401 for, like, 1.5-2.0 or something.
[06:27:57] <_|Nix|_> I guess we don't support weirdly identified custom select menus for now.
[06:28:34] <_|Nix|_> Oh, it even breaks pagecontainer, because the data-url of the dialog is also weird.
[06:31:42] <_|Nix|_> We really need to be careful with strings we retrieve from the DOM. They can contain /anything/.
[06:41:01] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do we want to address this now? https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/158
[06:41:20] <scott_gonzalez> Or do you think we can ignore that with the simplified structure?
[06:45:54] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I think we can go with the new structure, including the html file, without a readme. Looks simple enough now
[06:46:09] <scott_gonzalez> Great. That's what I was thinking too.
[06:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> So once the new structure lands, we can close that issue.
[06:51:57] <jzaefferer> I'd just close it now...

[10:01:37] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez arschmitz tj_vantoll: Why is it that we leave focus on the hidden checkbox instead of making the label tabbable, along with native outline?
[10:01:54] <scott_gonzalez> Because you can't keep focus on a label.
[10:01:55] <jzaefferer> That sounds like it would solve this one problem, but then introduce a dozen others
[10:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> It auto-forwards to the control.
[10:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> At least I think it does.
[10:02:33] <jzaefferer> Remove the for-attribute?
[10:03:10] <tj_vantoll> I think that gets into a11y-insanity to replicate the native behavior.
[10:04:46] <tj_vantoll> I'm heading out for a bit, but I'll do some thinking on this as well.
[10:06:01] <arschmitz> yeah i think we should avoid trying to replicate all the native control behivors
[10:06:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am not sure I get the problem. What if we forget about custom focus style (border and outline 0) and just stick to native. What problem occurs with checkbox?
[10:06:44] <jzaefferer> We need four visual states (blurred, focused, blurred+active, focused+active), but lack the last one...
[10:06:47] <arschmitz> the label is what we style and what is visible
[10:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> The focused element isn't visible.
[10:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/button/checkbox.html
[10:07:12] <arschmitz> and labels dont get focus so there is never a focus outline
[10:07:22] <uGoMobi> ok, so it's about applying the focus style to the button that doesn't have focus
[10:07:35] <uGoMobi> got it
[10:07:47] <arschmitz> in mobile we use a custom focus outline
[10:07:55] <arschmitz> but we want to avoid that
[10:08:06] <uGoMobi> actually we use border, no outline
[10:08:33] <arschmitz> well either way a custom style
[10:08:35] <arschmitz> not native
[10:08:35] <jzaefferer> Well, you use a box-shadow to display something that looks like the native outline, at least in Chrome
[10:08:58] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: speaking of CSS framework, can you push something to the repo, however incomplete? Its private anyway
[10:10:43] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: yeah, I know I should have done that already long time ago. I promise I'll do that tomorrow.
[10:10:53] <rxaviers> I'd like to learn what we are up to on regard of CSS framework
[10:11:22] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: do it today ;)
[10:11:25] <rxaviers> so, whenever there is something out there, plz just let me know

[10:32:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What exactly does "check with download builder" mean in the case of the table review? I guess that's trivially satisfied (right?) since I'm adding no new files.
[10:37:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, is the classes options dynamically settable? That is, if I modify the classes option at runtime, am I supposed to update the classes as they appear in the DOM?
[10:38:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Please say "no" :)
[10:38:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it should jet only never remove
[10:38:27] <arschmitz> set
[10:40:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OKOK, but if I .table( "option", "classes", { popup: "my-custom-class", ... } ); am I supposed to .removeClass( this.options.classes.popup ).addClass( options.classes.popup )?
[10:40:48] <arschmitz> no it should never remove anything
[10:40:48] <_|Nix|_> If you never remove, you can't really update later on.
[10:40:56] <arschmitz> just add
[10:41:16] <arschmitz> honestly its stupid at runtime anyway
[10:41:21] <_|Nix|_> Yes.
[10:41:26] <_|Nix|_> This should be part of defaults, not options.
[10:41:32] <arschmitz> because you can use the widget method in code
[10:42:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, but technically, the classes option would allow you to modify classes on parts of the widget which are not accessible via .widget()
[10:42:42] <arschmitz> oh wait wait your talking about the ui classes option not the wrapperclass option
[10:42:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes.
[10:43:01] <arschmitz> sorry my bad just a sec let me check its implementation
[10:44:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Basically, my question is whether I have to write a _setOptions handler for the classes option.
[10:46:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: based on the ui implementation no what it does is this
[10:46:25] <arschmitz> you set an object in options with structureclass: style-classes
[10:46:35] <arschmitz> and in the widget you now have a method _classes
[10:47:05] <arschmitz> that you use like this._classes( "structureclass" )
[10:47:13] <arschmitz> and it returns a list of style classes
[10:49:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... got a link to the implementation? That seems kinda overblown, when you can just this.options.classes.structureclass instead of this._classes( "structureclass" )
[10:49:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:  so then you just this.handle.addClass( this._classes( "ui-slider-handle" ) )
[10:49:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:  this.handle.addClass( this._classes( "ui-slider-handle ui-handle-left" ) )
[10:49:50] <arschmitz> also works and gives you the classes for both
[10:50:10] <_|Nix|_> Oh, so therein lies at once the convenience and the need for the function call.
[10:51:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but we don't yet have that landed, right?
[10:51:12] <_|Nix|_> ... at least, I'm not seeing it in the library as of master.
[10:51:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats correct
[10:51:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there is no handling in setOptions
[10:52:07] <_|Nix|_> OK. That takes a load off my shoulders.
[10:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Does Mobile really need the hashchange plugin at this point?
[10:53:18] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like everything we care about has it natively: http://caniuse.com/#search=hashchange
[10:53:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: IE8?
[10:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> According to caniuse.
[10:53:44] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: chrome on ios its broken 
[10:53:45] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: There's some comment in there about IE8.
[10:54:18] <arschmitz> oh wait no sorry im thinking of something else
[10:54:52] <arschmitz> replacestate is broken on ios chrome
[10:55:18] <arschmitz> yeah looks like now that we dropped 7 we can remove it
[10:56:25] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: oh i need to check wp7

[11:50:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'd say just use the same banner for structure and theme, just leave off the last line in the structure.
[11:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> So, don't include https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/19f9a2e719630c5739c7#file-jquery-ui-theme-css-L11
[11:51:17] <rxaviers> Ok
[11:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> To make sure that's clear, keep that line in theme, just not in structure.
[11:53:36] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, another slight things I've noticed on regard of file naming. We talked about having jquery-ui.structure.css and jquery-ui.theme.css

[13:37:37] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i checked every implementation i could find
[13:37:41] <arschmitz> none solve this issue
[13:37:55] <arschmitz> and most like filaments are impossible to navigate
[13:38:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: also most hide the native input in a way that it does not work with screen readers
[13:38:19] <arschmitz> display:none
[13:38:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, they describe it as "A custom and accessible checkbox and radio form control"
[13:38:56] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't seem very accessible to me.
[13:39:15] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7s712b0mz7nuafh/Screenshot%202014-05-14%2016.39.04.png
[13:39:29] <arschmitz> all eight radio buttons active at once
[13:39:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[13:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> Did you use the right arrow to do that?
[13:39:49] <scott_gonzalez> That was the only thing that did anythign at all for me.
[13:39:51] <arschmitz> yes
[13:39:57] <arschmitz> same here

[13:42:44] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: well theirs at least gets the screen reader part right unlike many but keyboard is totally busted
[13:42:45] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: if you start off one in the middle, the left arrow will select the currently selected as well as the one before that.
[13:44:37] <agcolom> so say you start from 3rd, one left selects 2 and 3, one right and you're on 3 but 2 and 3 are still selected, one right and 2 3 and 4 are selected. I can't seem to unselect from the keyboard
[13:45:39] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: whats weird is it seems like keyboard should work the same as native i dont see any keyboard handling in the js
[13:47:58] <agcolom> I cant get the checkboxes to get selected or unselected with the keyboard.
[13:48:34] <agcolom> arschmitz: Hi Alex, just checking, how many (roughly) of the JQM widgets that can be used outside of pages today?
[13:49:01] <arschmitz> all of them
[13:49:12] <agcolom> great! Thanks :-)
[13:49:21] <arschmitz> no problem
[13:49:42] <agcolom> I'll be at jQUK tomorrow, so wont be able to attend the meeting
[13:50:12] <arschmitz> ok
[13:50:18] <arschmitz> have fun
[13:50:33] <agcolom> it's more like stress time right now ;-)
[13:50:59] <agcolom> only just managed to rehearse for the 1st time today!
[13:52:05] <gseguin> agcolom: I'm sure you'll rock it
[13:52:15] <agcolom> gseguin: thanks :-)
[13:52:51] <agcolom> gseguin: when did we add AMD and bower support in JQM?
[13:53:11] <gseguin> agcolom: AMD early on, in 2011
[13:53:25] <gseguin> agcolom: bower a few month back
[13:53:34] <arschmitz> we have alwaays been on bower though
[13:53:44] <agcolom> wow! great! thanks :-)
[13:53:45] <arschmitz> they just used the package.json before instead of the bower.json
[13:54:30] <agcolom> ok
