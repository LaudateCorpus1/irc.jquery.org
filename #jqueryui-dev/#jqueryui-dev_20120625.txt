[04:48:01] <kborchers> rworth: hey, if there is anything else i can help with, i should have a few hours today and tomorrow if you want me to knock anything else out on the sites or anything else
[04:48:03] <kborchers> just let me know
[04:49:02] <rworth> kborchers would be awesome if you could work on the legacy branch of web-base-template and get the api-jquery-com index working in it
[04:49:50] <rworth> this is so we can take the api.jquery.com site live on the new server with the old design sooner than we launch the new design
[04:50:41] <kborchers> rworth: ok, i'll take a look
[04:50:44] <rworth> so I copied the existing theme over from the existing site, and got single pages working, like http://legacy.api.jquery.com/2012/06/25/attr/ (permalinks aren't working atm, sep. issue - help nacin )
[04:50:59] <rworth> but the index and category pages need help http://legacy.api.jquery.com/category/attributes/
[04:51:19] <rworth> they have code in them that's based on the old way which was xml is inside the db, not html
[04:51:52] <rworth> so mostly you'll be migrating code from master into legacy just enough to get the functionality, but preserving the legacy markup and classes
[04:52:41] <rworth> don't forget to add legacy. sites to your host file, same ip as stage.
[04:52:49] <kborchers> rworth: ok, that makes sense. is there a different hosts entry for legacy
[04:52:50] <rworth> hosts
[04:52:51] <kborchers> heh
[04:52:53] <kborchers> ok
[04:52:55] <rworth> :)
[04:53:26] <rworth> it's a separate install of wordpress with legacy branch of web-base-template checked out and a sep. db, but same server
[04:53:59] <rworth> content repos have (or will have) legacy branches as needed as well
[04:55:55] <rworth> jquery.com has one and other than the static index plugin not being activated ( another help nacin? ) http://legacy.jquery.com/index/ and http://legacy.jquery.com/download/ and http://legacy.jquery.com/browser-support/ are ready for legacy go-live
[04:58:53] <kborchers> rworth: ok, that all seems to make sense so i will dig into that today and let you know if i have any questions
[04:59:11] <rworth> awesome thanks kborchers
[04:59:26] <rworth> Feel free to call my cell, I won't be on irc or skype much until late tonight
[05:10:25] <rworth> nacin I manually set permalinks on the legacy. sites and added in issue for you to look into automating
[05:11:08] <rworth> also, I'm not sure why I had to manually activate the static index plugin only on the jquery.com site, seems to have worked on the others. Is it perhaps because jquery.com is the main (siteid 1) site?
[05:15:04] <kborchers> rworth: i just copied legacy web-base-template over my existing local wordpress and those pages you asked me to look at seem to be working
[05:15:29] <kborchers> rworth: http://gyazo.com/82a46e4550882cca5c1c2aef5ca5f1d0.png?1340626345
[05:23:22] <nacin> rworth: which sites do you want the static index plugin?
[05:23:49] <nacin> rworth: oh I see. yes, the main site does not adhere to the 'options' array in the install script. I can fix that.
[05:36:53] <rworth> kborchers is the index ( http://dev.api.jquery.com/ ) working for you?
[05:37:40] <kborchers> rworth: yep http://gyazo.com/bcd2c12de393687caa23d9ba2c15e481.png?1340627668
[05:38:52] <rworth> alright, maybe nacin can help debug why the same are not working on legacy.api.jquery.com ? http://legacy.api.jquery.com/ and http://legacy.api.jquery.com/category/attributes/
[05:38:55] <kborchers> rworth: not sure if it would make a difference but i don't have any permalink stuff set up locally
[05:42:20] <kborchers> i don't think that should make any difference though
[05:48:24] <Zavior> I'm loading a partial view inside a query dialog. I have a search function inside that view that I want to refresh the list of customers I'm looking at. Unfortunately the partial view it returns overwrites the entire page instead of just updating the dialog window. Any ideas or suggestions?

[07:24:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i think that sortable issue is in core but could be wrong. if i change https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/traversing.js#L161 to  } while ( cur && cur.nodeType !== 1 );  then everything is happy. which makes sense because cur.previousSibling would return null for the first element in the list right?
[07:27:45] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Yup
[07:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> That is indeed the check that used to be used in core.
[07:27:56] <kborchers> should i send a pr
[07:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: ^
[07:28:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw the q about it this morning and asked him to open a ticket
[07:28:44] <DaveMethvin> not sure why that was removed
[07:28:49] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: he opened the ticket on UI
[07:29:20] <DaveMethvin> what's the ticket, close yours and I'll just reference it

[07:29:45] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8409
[07:29:56] <FJ1> sorry for that. i didn't know if it is a jquery or a ui problem.
[07:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> FJ1: No problem, thanks for reporting it.
[07:31:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah FJ1better now than later! :D
[07:31:17] <FJ1> welcome. better then after release :-)

[07:32:20] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I closed it as fixed, don't make me a liar :-)
[07:32:40] <DaveMethvin> i'll close ours as wontfix then scott_gonzalez
[07:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[07:32:46] <kborchers> haha
[07:33:14] <DaveMethvin> i can't even figure how that passed unit tests, seems like it would blow up
[07:35:56] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: MOAR TESTS
[07:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, not sure how that would pass if it was tested at all.
[07:36:49] <scott_gonzalez> Well, jq-jenkins *is* complaining about failed tests for core :-P
[07:38:30] <DaveMethvin> jenkins ALWAYS complains
[07:38:46] <DaveMethvin> We're down to some mystery fails in IE8, can't figure them out: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/80
[07:49:26] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[07:51:29] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We've got new failures in Opera 11.5x with 1.8pre. That's known and we don't care anymore, correct?
[08:03:00] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: any thoughts on those jquery-1.6.x failures? I've addressed a few in autocomplete and tooltip tests, but there are still others that I couldn't figure out
[08:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm looking at autocomplete 1.6.3 in Opera right now.
[08:05:56] <jzaefferer> looks like jquery-color is all green on jenkins: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/
[08:06:44] <jzaefferer> gnarf: just needs to be released and copied over to UI?
[08:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> So Opera doesn't handle [contenteditable] selector.
[08:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oh crap
[08:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> .prop( "contenteditable" ) => "inherit"
[08:13:42] <scott_gonzalez> I assumed that would be boolean.
[08:25:18] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so fun times. trying to write unit tests for that core issue from earlier and can't get them to fail :/
[08:25:42] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: it is enumerated. strings "true", "false", or "inherit"
[08:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, hopefully this change will fix the IE failures as well.
[08:37:15] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: regarding Opera 11.5 issues, known/not care anymore: Should we just turn off 11.5 for swarm, start testing against 12 instead? so 11.6 + 12
[08:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, just wanted confirmation from someone on core.
[08:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> BrowserStack doesn't have 12 yet, but they're actively working on it.
[08:38:30] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[08:39:19] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez i agree, let's take out 11.5 now
[08:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: DO IT!
[08:39:56] <jzaefferer> well, I can take it off now, then add 12 once its available
[08:40:32] <jzaefferer> just a matter of removing one line of json :-)
[08:40:45] <DaveMethvin> IT'S TOO HARD!
[08:40:55] <DaveMethvin> I'd better put in a pull request on that

[08:43:45] <jzaefferer> tooltip?
[08:43:58] <jzaefferer> are you looking at this job? http://swarm.jquery.org/job/60

[08:44:43] <jzaefferer> err
[08:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> I was looking at 58
[08:44:49] <jzaefferer> ^^^
[08:44:54] <jzaefferer> well, look at 60 :-)
[08:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, cool, so you fixed tooltip.
[08:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> In that case, can you kick off a new build?
[08:45:54] <jzaefferer> yeah, and a similar issue in autocomplete tests
[08:46:12] <scott_gonzalez> I think we should be down to effects with 1.6 and 1.6.1.
[08:46:32] <jzaefferer> you can log into jenkins at hit the green Run button next to the coverage job any time
[08:46:46] <jzaefferer> ah, not autocomplete, was in core: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/8f6c656c280354111302bc352bde0f9db4d1ba54

[09:11:11] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: logged into jenkins?
[09:11:35] <jzaefferer> then look at front page. Last column has "Schedule a build" buttons

[09:28:39] <jzaefferer> looks good so far - gnarf lets land those effects!!1
[09:28:44] <nacin> rworth: I'm around all day to help with things. trying to catch up on scrollback. what are the big issues at the moment?
[09:29:41] <nacin> rworth: is the only difference from the legacy branch just that some of the themes are old? if so, why not just put those themes as is in /themes for master? we could also do a /themes-legacy folder in master.
[09:32:41] <jzaefferer> nacin: fixing the category descriptions would help a lot
[09:33:00] <jzaefferer> which was all about making Karl's plugin apply to xml-rpc?
[09:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Any idea what's going on with http://swarm.jquery.org/result/19323 ?
[09:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> It died in the middle and I don't get any errors running it manually.
[09:34:30] <jzaefferer> "[TestSwarm] window.onerror: Invalid argument."
[09:34:35] <jzaefferer> not very helpful
[09:36:05] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:36:25] <nacin> jzaefferer: on it today
[09:36:44] <jzaefferer> a test like that should get rerun
[09:36:58] <jzaefferer> doesn't look like it will though
[09:37:21] <jzaefferer> Krinkle did a lot of fine-tuning in that area recently, probably still not quite there yet
[09:37:24] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[09:39:07] <jzaefferer> let's see about that once color 2.0 landed
[09:39:23] <jzaefferer> everything else is looking pretty good
[09:40:35] <rworth> nacin check with gnarf on what we need to take jquery.com live today. From my end it is ready. I think he mentioned he wanted to check with you to make sure it was configured right to handle the load
[09:40:37] <jzaefferer> awesome to see three Chrome 18 clients run tests in parallel :-)
[09:41:08] <nacin> rworth: I guess we'll find out. :-) There is some stuff I want to add to the nginx config to help out, not sure if he did.
[09:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> It's even more awesome to see all that green.

[09:43:50] <rworth> nacin I thought about having legacy themes, but it's a lot cleaner to have the same exact structure, the only difference for legacy is which branch is checked out for web-base-template
[09:44:31] <nacin> rworth: if that works for you, that's fine. WP supports multiple theme roots quite nicely, so you could literally just do /themes-legacy and then it's just a matter of a theme switch.
[09:44:46] <nacin> I also don't usually think in terms of branching.
[09:44:50] <rworth> nacin good to know

[10:54:38] <jzaefferer> nacin: where do I put that?

[10:54:51] <jzaefferer> replacing the existing plugin?
[10:54:56] <nacin> jzaefferer: replace the entire contents of.. yes.
[10:55:00] <jzaefferer> ok
[10:55:14] <rworth> pygmentize is the slowest part of that build, but on most of our machines it's just a second or two per page
[10:55:37] <DaveMethvin> rworth: speaking of Pygmentize, does that work on Windows?
[10:55:46] <rworth> should if you've got python
[10:55:50] <nacin> yeah. I had the whole thing running for about 5 minutes, though. felt stalled. guess that could just be pygmentize running on 300 pages.
[10:55:54] <rworth> and install with `easy_install pygments`
[10:57:19] <DaveMethvin> definitely don't have python installed

[11:03:51] <nacin> so after I run `grunt`, I have nothing in my DB. is that a separate task?
[11:04:01] <rworth> and should I add an issue about jquery.com plugin activation?
[11:04:07] <nacin> rworth: fixed already
[11:04:09] <rworth> grunt deploy
[11:04:13] <rworth> awesome
[11:04:41] <nacin> grunt deploy seems to be triggering the full re-build. I see. "deploy" is not the default?
[11:04:49] <rworth> correct
[11:04:57] <rworth> and if you want to just publish, not rebuild
[11:05:00] <rworth> grunt wordpress-publish
[11:05:17] <nacin> damn, I wish you said that first. gotta wait another 5 minutes now. :)
[11:05:21] <nacin> guess I am going to hit up issue 39
[11:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to consider this a success and move on: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/88
[11:05:33] <rworth> we usually stick with something fast for the default, like just linting
[11:05:48] <rworth> since building is often a 5min type thing, and has a clean at the front of it
[11:05:50] <nacin> appears like the default is the whole build.
[11:05:57] <rworth> depends on the repo
[11:06:03] <nacin> yeah. I'm on api.
[11:06:19] <rworth> the whole build but not deploying?
[11:06:24] <nacin> yeah.
[11:06:41] <nacin> trying to ascertain whether that's expected behavior.
[11:06:58] <rworth> it's alright
[11:08:14] <rworth> nacin so one of my tasks for today is getting users in this database that can be credited as authors across all/any sites
[11:08:22] <nacin> okay.
[11:08:37] <rworth> will xml-rpc help us here?
[11:08:39] <nacin> the install script should probably be allowed to work against an existing user table, for one.
[11:09:23] <nacin> rworth: yes. we won't be pulling user stuff into XML-RPC until 3.5, but that just consists of merging in a plugin that maxcutler already wrote, so we can use that.
[11:09:37] <rworth> ok
[11:10:24] <rworth> I'm guessing we'll uniquely identify users by username?
[11:10:52] <rworth> So we could have "author":"jeresig" in the metadata of a post?
[11:11:07] <nacin> probably best, yes.
[11:11:15] <nacin> you could do email addresses, but those could change.
[11:11:24] <rworth> sure, and there is more than one
[11:12:38] <rworth> our plan is to create a profiles.jquery.com site to collect people's user info across all jQuery sites. So I can create that and start putting in users
[11:12:53] <rworth> nacin I think you recommended once we not do them as a custom post type
[11:13:11] <rworth> So I'd just create a users.json file, ala taxonomies.json
[11:13:16] <rworth> you think scott_gonzalez ?
[11:13:16] <nacin> no, you can. but I'd probably just start off as user accounts. you won't have many authors at the moment.
[11:13:23] <rworth> sure
[11:13:26] <nacin> yeah, users.json.
[11:13:37] <nacin> keeping in mind that users are global.
[11:13:49] <rworth> eventually we want hundreds, caus it will be people that submit plugins, or a review of a plugin, or a book review, or whatever
[11:13:55] <rworth> yeah
[11:14:07] <rworth> that's why I want this in one site
[11:14:18] <nacin> right. still worth sticking to standard WP users.
[11:14:18] <rworth> and the profile url will be profiles.jquery.com/username
[11:14:24] <rworth> ok
[11:17:33] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: We're associating plugins with users?
[11:17:40] <nacin> hmm. >> Error processing category setup-methods. / Error: Unexpected end / Line 0: Column: 0 / Char:
[11:19:27] <rworth> scott_gonzalez sure, authors and maintainers. We can have info in their profile that matches info in package.json files
[11:20:35] <scott_gonzalez> umm...
[11:20:40] <DaveMethvin> okay, this is another five minute job with a five hour journey i'm afraid
[11:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> What would that look like?
[11:20:56] <rworth> nacin python error?
[11:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> They can already link to their own site.
[11:21:24] <nacin> rworth: Not sure. just re-ran the sync.
[11:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> That's coming from grunt-wordpress.
[11:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> WordPress responded with a broken response.
[11:22:11] <nacin> well that was lame of WP.
[11:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing based on line 0 column 0 that the response was blank.
[11:22:28] <nacin> so just a matter of my local server twitching.
[11:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> Check your PHP error log, see if something happened.
[11:22:42] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I think the last time we talked about this we said they could link to their jquery.org profile in the package.json
[11:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> You mean as their URL instead of their site?
[11:23:25] <rworth> or did we think it would be another supported property of the user?
[11:23:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/docs/package.md#people-fields
[11:23:48] <rworth> to not have that kind of change, we could instead of each profile contain user records that match
[11:24:05] <nacin> jzaefferer: I can confirm that the code works for me. Going to push it; if you're still having problems, let me know.
[11:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: I'm not sure what you're saying.
[11:24:35] <rworth> so for example, the profiles.jquery.org/scott_gonzalez json might have an three entries, each with a different email address
[11:25:04] <rworth> then it doesn't matter how you were credited in each of a bunch of plugins' package.json files (even historical ones)
[11:25:09] <rworth> the profile links them all together
[11:25:48] <rworth> including it could have the twitter username, github username, and we could build on this profile for the SSO
[11:25:54] <rworth>  /federated login
[11:26:40] <scott_gonzalez> So the user has two links on the plugins site?
[11:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> Or we ignore the URL from package.json?
[11:26:58] <rworth> two links on the plugins site?
[11:27:13] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/docs/package.md#people-fields
[11:27:25] <nacin> mind you, one of them would be internal to a profile page. say, other plugins by that user.
[11:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> Every author already has the ability to have their name listed as a link to any URL they want.
[11:27:35] <nacin> Are profiles really a priority though?
[11:27:48] <nacin> Seems like icing on the cake.
[11:27:51] <rworth> I only brought up profiles because it seemed like the right way to do authors
[11:28:05] <rworth> in terms of building it now the way that would scale beyond team members
[11:28:10] <rworth> great example is the learn site
[11:28:13] <nacin> you'll need it for blog posts and such, sure. but you don't need profiles.* for that yet.
[11:28:27] <rworth> so we can say to a potential learn article author "fork the profiles. repo and add your info"
[11:29:10] <rworth> of course the much simpler way is to just use people's github id's, but that ties us to that one service
[11:29:17] <rworth> and in previous discussions, people didn't want to do that
[11:29:25] <rworth> hence the profiles.jquery.org usernamespace
[11:29:48] <nacin> does it make sense for a lot of that information to be in a public repo, like an email address, to begin with?
[11:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> Please fork the repo, add your name, email address, date of birth, SSN, and credit card info. :-)
[11:30:47] <rworth> the only thing that *really* needs to be a in a public repo is what username they want, and some way we can identify they are them
[11:31:43] <scott_gonzalez> If we start with just normal users with absolutely nothing custom and no pages, that shouldn't prevent us from doing whatever we want later.
[11:31:52] <scott_gonzalez> nacin, is that correct?
[11:32:23] <nacin> sounds right to me. the only challenge is to figure out a unique namespace for a user.
[11:32:30] <rworth> I have no problem with that, but we need a repo to put this in
[11:32:41] <rworth> so why not call that profiles.jquery.com
[11:32:49] <rworth> up to you whether you want to keep that repo private
[11:33:03] <rworth> could work too, people could use a webform to submit profile info
[11:33:09] <rworth> or the eventual SSO/federated login
[11:33:29] <nacin> SSO other than what WP would provide?
[11:33:44] <rworth> I'm testing OneAll
[11:34:13] <nacin> I guess my question was what else would people be logging into
[11:34:41] <rworth> http://www.oneall.com/services/single-sign-on/
[11:35:11] <nacin> I see.
[11:35:14] <rworth> they would eventually log in to rate/review a plugin, review a book, etc.
[11:35:44] <nacin> so multiple services to log into WP, rather than logging in across multiple platforms.
[11:35:54] <rworth> so the goal is to have them log in to all our network of sites but not rely/encourage keeping passwords for them
[11:35:57] <rworth> yup
[11:36:01] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Was this just 1.6 or 1.6.x? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/8f6c656c280354111302bc352bde0f9db4d1ba54#L0R159
[11:36:02] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by Jörn Zaefferer (6d, 3h ago): Core: Make uniqueId test pass in IE6/7 with jQuery 1.6, where undefined id is returned as empty string
[11:36:26] <rworth> so that's the eventuality of profiles, but for today we just need users that can be authors
[11:36:37] <rworth> and I can put all the minimum info in a users.json
[11:36:42] <nacin> that's not "SSO", so I got confused. got it now.
[11:36:51] <rworth> federated login
[11:37:03] <nacin> yeah.
[11:37:30] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: 1.6 and 1.6.1 - http://swarm.jquery.org/job/58
[11:37:44] <nacin> looking through the things in /plugins - don't think you guys are using most of these, correct?
[11:37:44] <rworth> it is SSO in being across jquery.com and jquery.org and mobile, ui, etc. no?
[11:38:15] <nacin> rworth: we can do some trickery to allow someone to log into, say, jquery.org and be logged in across the whole network.
[11:38:26] <rworth> nacin that's cool
[11:38:44] <rworth> the learn site is/was/will be using hierachical-pages
[11:38:59] <nacin> raw-html appears unneeded.
[11:39:02] <rworth> no-comments-on-pages could be mu
[11:39:16] <nacin> obviously don't need the importer or the domain-mapping plugin.
[11:39:30] <rworth> yeah
[11:39:38] <rworth> these are relics
[11:40:49] <rworth> nacin should we disable /wp-admin/ on the production server since we're doing everything via XML-RPC ?
[11:41:33] <nacin> easy enough to do.
[11:41:43] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Does that really seem wise?
[11:41:53] <nacin> doesn't seem necessary to me.
[11:41:54] <rworth> I think it is, yeah
[11:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> Could we instead put a huge warning on wp-admin?
[11:42:06] <rworth> I was just thinking in terms of security
[11:42:20] <rworth> but if we're not worried as long as we have a secure pw, then ok
[11:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: It means that nobody can ever go in to look at stuff or tweak a setting that isn't controlled via XML-RPC.
[11:42:28] <nacin> in terms of security, there should be very few people with super admin.
[11:42:32] <rworth> just seemed we could have it off unless we needed it to be on
[11:42:44] <rworth> and that seems beyond rare in the case of the production server
[11:43:00] <scott_gonzalez> And in the case when it's needed, it's probably urgent.
[11:43:06] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: looking at stuff is good. tweaking a setting could/should happen at the code level. but as long as only a few people have access, that shouldn't be a problem.
[11:43:07] <rworth> it's better that someone isn't able to do what shouldn't be done through the ui, caus if the server is rebuilt that work is lost
[11:43:35] <nacin> would it really be more than the three of us with super admin anyway? plus the account used by the XML-RPC.
[11:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: That's not a concern if every page in wp-admin has a 500px tall red box that says GTFO.
[11:43:41] <rworth> I'm fine with a big warning at the top, sure
[11:43:48] <nacin> "locking it down" means not giving people access, plain and simple.
[11:44:27] <rworth> three of us plus like gnarf and danheberden
[11:46:21] <rworth> nacin so what would using this maxcutler plugin look like, and would scott_gonzalez have to modify grunt-wordpress for it?
[11:46:59] <nacin> he would have to write a few new methods for user edit/new

[11:47:52] <rworth> should I just create the users.json property names based on the wp_users field names?

[11:48:20] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by Scott González (1m, 19s ago): Core tests: Updated support comments.
[11:48:29] <nacin> username, password, email are the only ones required for creating a user.
[11:48:48] <rworth> but we don't want passwords. well, not in the users.json file
[11:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> Core started doing that a while ago, it's pretty nice. Makes it easy to find what code to drop when we change what we support.
[11:49:40] <nacin> we'd pass a bogus password like '~~~' and hash something else, then send a password reset email to the email address, or something.
[11:49:46] <rworth> for making use of typical code that will link to a page/post author, I'd guess we'll want display name as well?
[11:49:58] <nacin> display name, first name, last name would all make sense.
[11:50:02] <rworth> great
[11:50:17] <rworth> we'll just have them be required for our system then
[11:50:18] <nacin> let me link you to the field names that max used
[11:50:22] <rworth> thanks
[11:50:33] <nacin> and if we tweak it when it goes into core, I'll fix the jquery stuff. :)

[11:53:31] <gnarf> nacin / scott_gonzalez / rworth is it possible to hand out non-global xml-rpc accounts
[11:53:32] <gnarf> ?
[11:53:35] <gnarf> like ajpiano
[11:53:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, this won't actually go through grunt-wordpress, will it?
[11:53:41] <gnarf> he edits these 3 sites
[11:53:52] <gnarf> i suppose
[11:54:01] <nacin> gnarf: yes. we'd just have to make one tweak.
[11:54:02] <rworth> scott_gonzalez actually we are talking about it, yeah. nacin said you could add a couple methods
[11:54:12] <gnarf> i was kinda imagining that people could use stage as a "working machine" too
[11:54:23] <gnarf> rather than needing a VM / local install
[11:54:51] <ajpiano> hey scott_gonzalez welcome back !
[11:55:17] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks ajpiano.
[11:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> Why would this use grunt-wordpress?
[11:55:40] <gnarf> nacin: did you want to modify that nginx config to turn on the microcaching
[11:55:51] <gnarf> nacin: need to do that on puppet now
[11:56:10] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #551: SUCCESS in 8 min 57 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/551/
[11:56:10] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Core tests: Updated support comments.
[11:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> It's just creating users, right?
[11:56:23] <gnarf> prolly
[11:56:25] <scott_gonzalez> It's not creating posts or taxonomies or anything.
[11:56:28] <gnarf> nope
[11:56:38] <jzaefferer> nacin: just installed fresh with the install script, looking good. http://dev.api.qunitjs.com/ was missing in the readme, just added that
[11:56:49] <rworth> scott_gonzalez it is. How else would we create them, caus we're not going to do it via wp-admin, and we don't want them in web-base-template (I don't think)
[11:57:09] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: It is what?
[11:57:16] <scott_gonzalez> It is going to create posts and taxonomies?
[11:57:23] <rworth> sorry. is is just creating users
[11:57:32] <rworth> nacin said users are coming to xml-rpc in 3.5
[11:57:43] <rworth> and the maxcutler plugin linked above is how that will come about
[11:57:48] <rworth> so we can just use it in the meantime
[11:57:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I understand that.
[11:58:04] <scott_gonzalez> But we don't want grunt-wordpress syncing users.
[11:58:13] <scott_gonzalez> It would be blowing away all users for all repos.
[11:58:28] <scott_gonzalez> That's definitely not what we want to do.
[11:58:32] <rworth> I was thinking we would for the profiles.jquery.org repo only, and it would do updates, just like it does for posts/pages
[11:58:43] <rworth> so that repo would only contain users.json
[11:58:45] <gnarf> afaik - we only need to login to wp-admin when we want to tweak some setting in the plugins or create a user....
[11:58:47] <rworth> and use grunt-wordpress to sync
[11:59:26] <jzaefferer> nacin rworth: can the install script update permalinks? still getting urls like this: http://dev.api.jqueryui.com/2012/06/25/accordion/
[12:00:02] <rworth> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/39
[12:00:03] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #39 on web-base-template (rdworth; 7h, 2m ago): Permalinks should be set to /%postname%/ by install
[12:00:50] <jzaefferer> also after a fresh install and deploy of UI API, both category and posts don't work, always getting the 404 page
[12:00:55] <jzaefferer> only index works
[12:01:06] <rworth> jzaefferer do you have a good .htaccess ?
[12:01:10] <gnarf> jzaefferer: "Fresh" as of < 1 hr ago? :)
[12:01:26] <jzaefferer> might be .htaccess, lemme check
[12:01:47] <nacin> jzaefferer: right now it's only install, not yet for upgrades. If you just go to Settings > Permalinks and change it, you'll be fine.
[12:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather build a one-off grunt task directly in the profiles repo.
[12:02:41] <rworth> scott_gonzalez ok. So, can you help with that, since you have the xml-rpc experience?
[12:02:50] <jzaefferer> okay, I might have missed that commit...
[12:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I can do that.
[12:03:22] <rworth> thanks
[12:03:32] <jzaefferer> where do I set AllowOverride for a VirtualHost? nacin, could you add that to the readme?
[12:03:41] <rworth> I'll get started on the users.json

[12:03:42] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Tests: Update support comments.
[12:04:00] <nacin> jzaefferer: add what to the readme? you asking about allowoverride?
[12:04:05] <jzaefferer> yeah
[12:04:07] <rworth> hmm, just remembered the other reason I wanted more robust profiles today
[12:04:14] <rworth> to prevent duplicate author users
[12:04:32] <jzaefferer> AllowOverride is not valid inside <VirtualHost>..
[12:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> Though post_author still needs to be a user id (numeric).
[12:04:45] <rworth> if I do an import of 4 blogs, we're going to have duplicates. I guess I could go to each one and normalize their info?
[12:04:53] <rworth> eeks
[12:05:15] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I want to be able to do "author":"username"
[12:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: You can't.
[12:05:23] <rworth> then we do a lookup and fail if it's not there
[12:05:29] <rworth> nacin ^
[12:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> We'd need to write custom logic around that.
[12:05:45] <nacin> jzaefferer: it is, inside <Directory> inside <VirtualHost>
[12:05:52] <rworth> it doesn't make sense to have 5 years of blog posts with numeric author ids
[12:06:02] <rworth> ok, would that be a wordpress plugin?
[12:06:41] <jzaefferer> nacin: <Directory>AllowOverride all</Directory>?
[12:06:52] <jzaefferer> There's a reason why I prefer nginx these days...
[12:07:11] <nacin> think it needs a path, but could be wrong. as in <Directory "/Users/nacin/Sites/jquery">
[12:08:00] <scott_gonzalez> You can use <Directory />
[12:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> It already knows the DocumentRoot, so / is relative.
[12:08:29] <nacin> thanks, scott_gonzalez.
[12:08:41] <gnarf> jzaefferer: it can be in a Location or a Directory tag
[12:08:47] <rworth> so what about this username lookup. thoughts nacin ?
[12:10:11] <rworth> scott_gonzalez forgot ajpiano had a question while you were gone. Does grunt-wordpress support menu_order post metadata? Or is that planned?
[12:10:20] <rworth> it's for the learn site
[12:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it's exposed in WordPress XML-RPC.
[12:12:23] <nacin> I think it is.
[12:12:28] <rworth> :)
[12:12:31] <rworth> battle
[12:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I think only as a return value.
[12:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, node-wordpress supports it.
[12:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> menuOrder
[12:13:00] <jzaefferer> nacin gnarf: I've reinstalled, now permalinks look okay, but any non-root pages 404; nothing in the Apache error_log
[12:13:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_WordPress_API/Posts has no mention of menu_order
[12:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> There's menu_position, but that's for post types, not posts.
[12:14:33] <scott_gonzalez> Let me find the logs. I brought this up in #wordpress-dev a while ago.
[12:17:57] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: it *should* accept menu_order since it takes the entire struct, and after processing it, it passes it to wp_insert_post()
[12:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ok
[12:18:11] <scott_gonzalez> nacin rworth ajpiano https://gist.github.com/2990658
[12:19:08] <jzaefferer> silly Apache, got it working now
[12:19:19] <jzaefferer> nacin, regarding category descriptions, this doesn't look right: http://bassistance.de/i/52467b.png
[12:19:28] <jzaefferer> is that what you see?
[12:21:40] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: So the answer is that grunt-wordpress supports menuOrder, unless you prove otherwise :-P
[12:21:59] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i was putting menu_order in the json by accident when last i change dit
[12:22:09] <ajpiano> and now i'm in th eprocess of testing it with the proper casing
[12:23:38] <rworth> scott_gonzalez nacin would it be crazy to support image and .js and .css files in any folder, not just in /resources/ ?
[12:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: So do you have any ideas on how we could pass a username instead of a user id for post_author?
[12:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean by any folder?
[12:23:58] <rworth> reason I ask is caus otherwise we're going to have do a lot of redirects or proxying
[12:24:08] <rworth> I mean like /js/jquery.js
[12:24:15] <rworth> or /browser-support/ie.png
[12:24:47] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: we could write a simple plugin for that, yeah.
[12:25:01] <scott_gonzalez> Why can't we use /resources/browser-support/ie.png?
[12:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish.
[12:25:16] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: just pass postAuthorName or something, instead of postAuthor. Then we can use the xmlrpc_wp_insert_post_data filter to look up the user's ID.
[12:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: :-)
[12:25:21] <rworth> we can, but I'm starting to look through access logs and seeing how many urls we'd have to change
[12:25:23] <rworth> or redirect
[12:25:25] <rworth> or proxy
[12:25:40] <rworth> and that's a lot to configure and test and sync between stage+prod
[12:25:59] <rworth> so it makes me wonder whether our current restriction is "worth it" ?
[12:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Most will need to change anyway.
[12:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> We don't want to put resources in random places.
[12:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> And many image resources are probably uploaded anyway, so the URLs will need to change.
[12:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> Are you worried about the one time effort of updating URLs or about third-party links breaking?
[12:29:00] <rworth> for 3rd party links, I remembered that gnarf has a great idea to proxy to the legacy box when a url isn't found on the new box
[12:29:25] <rworth> so that gives us a longer-term migration path, while still allowing us to bring new pages up on new servers "now"
[12:29:56] <rworth> I guess at the core of my concern is whether to have anything other than an html page, the url has to start with /resources/
[12:30:10] <rworth> whether that makes sense as a rule across all our sites. maybe it does
[12:30:32] <rworth> but I'm thinking it through in terms of looking at all the non-page urls we currently support
[12:31:15] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see any reasons that it doens't make sense.
[12:35:38] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Should we just drop http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/xml-rpc-modernization/trunk/class-wp-xmlrpc-server-ext.php into mu-plugins?
[12:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> Or I guess we could just add it as a plugin for the profiles site.
[12:36:04] <nacin> sounds good. I would actually put it in /plugins and network-activate it.
[12:53:34] <ajpiano> appears that using the proper case works fine
[12:53:41] <ajpiano> just had to setup my entire local env again :|
[12:53:52] <ajpiano> the good news is install.php still works!
[13:21:23] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: So which repos will be using authors right now?
[13:21:30] <scott_gonzalez> blog and learn?
[13:40:51] <rworth> and updates
[13:41:07] <rworth> though that has no repo yet
[13:41:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'm only concerned with what's launching at the conf.
[13:41:57] <scott_gonzalez> Is the blog launching at the conf or just learn?
[13:42:03] <rworth> that's part of jquery.org, so it needs to, yeah
[13:42:22] <rworth> I mean it's currently jquery.org/updates so to launch jquery.org without /updates we need to move that to updates.jquery.org
[13:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> Is that actually going to be done in time?
[13:43:14] <rworth> yes
[13:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> So updates is switching to grunt-wordpress in a few days?
[13:44:40] <rworth> yes
[13:45:02] <rworth> which I guess means updates will be authored in github rather than via email
[13:45:09] <rworth> just like blog posts
[13:47:04] <rworth> jzaefferer any idea why legacy api works for you on dev. but not me?
[13:47:11] <rworth> have you tried since you re-built?
[13:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> I have serious doubts about all of this happening before the conf.
[13:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I assume that I'm now responsible for the plugins site design updates?
[13:48:00] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I'll have the content migrated before 10am tomorrow
[13:49:02] <rworth> I can do the plugins site design. There are back-end things you and gnarf/nacin still need to work through, yeah?
[13:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> For the plugins site or for all sites?
[13:49:37] <rworth> for the plugins site
[13:50:00] <rworth> I'm saying better you focus on that because I'm not much help there, whereas I can do the design impl.
[13:50:41] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you know what needs to happen to get the plugins site running on the server?
[13:53:03] <scott_gonzalez> I assume nobody reviewed any of the demos while I was gone?
[14:44:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: nope
[14:44:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I assume we need to get your node processes a home
[14:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah. There are three scripts that need to run forever.
[14:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> Do we have a plan for how to handle updates when we're running a node server?
[14:46:15] <gnarf> no, but I assume it will be pull updates, then restart service - and that "restart service" part can be a part of our post-receive
[14:46:36] <gnarf> stage following master, make sure shit still works, the tag version for live
[14:46:45] <gnarf> s/the/then
[14:47:00] <scott_gonzalez> Right, but how are we gracefully handling the restart service part?
[14:47:16] <scott_gonzalez> We'll want to let any existing requests finish out on the old process.
[14:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> But pass new requests to the new process.
[14:48:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I assume there is some way we can gracefully tell node to stop listening
[14:48:29] <scott_gonzalez> The process I know of for that is to have multiple servers and turn some off where off = some load balancer in front stops serving requests to a handful of servers
[14:48:31] <gnarf> i might be wrong
[14:48:47] <scott_gonzalez> Well, nginx will be sitting in front.
[14:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> I assume we could just launch each upgrade on a different port.
[14:49:12] <gnarf> we can't just killall -PS1 plugin-site.js
[14:49:35] <gnarf> and that will stop listening for new connections, then we spawn the new servers which start listening?
[14:49:53] <gnarf> and if there is a few ms window in between when there is nothing listening, it's gonna 500
[14:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so let's say we've got v1 running on port 8000.
[14:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> Then v2 comes out.
[14:50:20] <scott_gonzalez> We'd stand up v2 on 8001.
[14:50:35] <scott_gonzalez> Once it's up, we'd tell nginx to start forwarding all requests to 8001.
[14:50:50] <gnarf> Why can't we just tell v1 to stop listening, and exit when its current requests finish, then launch v2?
[14:50:50] <scott_gonzalez> Then we wait a while before killing the v1 server on 8000.
[14:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> Because then we miss stuff.
[14:51:59] <gnarf> I see: v1 stops listening, v2 starts, v1 finishes requests and exits
[14:52:15] <gnarf> not v1 waits to finish running before v2 starts
[14:52:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but you want v2 to start before v1 stops.
[14:52:49] <scott_gonzalez> We don't need to tell v1 to stop listening if nginx just stops forwarding requests to it.
[14:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> But we can if we want it to exit on its own.
[14:53:28] <gnarf> agree- but that seems more complicated than signaling v1 processes to remove their "listen" and then starting v2
[14:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I see...
[14:54:40] <gnarf> Although I see what you're saying about the "some ports" - but assuming we have more than one v1 process, and more than one v2 process, listening on separate ports
[14:55:09] <scott_gonzalez> I was assuming it'd be one process per version.
[14:55:13] <gnarf> v1 port 8000 gets signal and hangs up on listens, and v2 port 8000 has been waiting for port 8000 to be listening
[14:55:32] <gnarf> er listenable
[14:55:34] <gnarf> if thats even a word
[14:56:01] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let me see what I can do about that.
[14:56:04] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, actually...
[14:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> What are we using to keep services running?
[14:56:17] <gnarf> well if we did it with 2 - 3 processes....
[14:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> And how will that come into play with this?
[14:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> We need something that will auto-restart the process if it dies.
[14:56:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: undecided yet - do you have a suggestion?
[14:57:07] <gnarf> agree on that - i assume there is some tool specifically for node processes that does this?
[14:57:13] <scott_gonzalez> I was thinking either whatever service comes with the linux distro we're using (something like monit?) or forever.
[14:57:24] <gnarf> we can install either
[14:57:30] <gnarf> i've used monit before
[14:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> Forever is a node module.
[14:57:48] <gnarf> seems like that might be easier to do
[14:57:58] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever/
[14:58:01] <gnarf> less config that way maybe?
[14:58:45] <gnarf> so like - just FYI - aside from a short period of time tomorrow when I have to talk to my team about how to properly use branches and pull requests... the rest of this week is wide open for jQuery
[14:59:05] <gnarf> like - if I'm not touchable on IRC/Skype and you need me - call my phone
[15:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[15:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look into writing a script that uses Forever to run the other three scripts.
[15:02:05] <gnarf> yeah - like so far this box that will be running these processes has nothing on it
[15:02:10] <gnarf> so it has whatever you tell me we need ;)
[15:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> heh, ok
[15:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can we close this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7105
[15:10:57] <scott_gonzalez> Now that $.sub is deprecated.
[15:11:13] <gnarf> yeah - kill it
[15:11:26] <gnarf> still sad - cuz that coulda been fun to play with
[15:17:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: also, you get the empty box all to yourself for now for plugins
[15:18:03] <gnarf> cuz im actually gonna have like 2 extra boxes now that we've changed up the plan with proxies
[15:18:31] <scott_gonzalez> That's good, cuz we have no idea what the load will be like :-)
[15:18:44] <gnarf> also
[15:18:47] <gnarf> just FYI
[15:18:54] <gnarf> if you can give me a shell command to output some number
[15:19:00] <gnarf> we can graph it in zabbix
[15:19:08] <gnarf> so like if you wanna know # of plugin updates per minute
[15:19:12] <gnarf> we can graph that shit
[15:19:50] <gnarf> I plan on adding a graph for wc -l /var/log/nginx/access.log for instance
[15:20:11] <gnarf> to give us an approx # of HTTP reqs per second as a graph
[15:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> Lets have a call tomorrow to go over this.
[15:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> I've already got logging which can either go to stdout or to syslog.
[15:21:03] <gnarf> sure - 3/4 pm ish central work for you? that would be best
[15:21:14] <gnarf> i know for sure I'll be free around then
[15:21:22] <scott_gonzalez> That's tough for me since that's the end of my day.
[15:21:40] <gnarf> any other time is a crap shoot right now.... I need to prep to get on the plane
[15:22:12] <gnarf> i can prolly do like noon my time if we keep it under a half hour
[15:22:51] <gnarf> but that would make my git branch pull request meeting with my team @ work like 1 hr
[15:22:55] <gnarf> which might be enough time
[15:22:58] <gnarf> but you never know....
[15:22:59] <gnarf> :)
[15:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> That should work for me.
[15:23:58] <gnarf> I >may< be available at 11am my time, depending on how long my pre-flight errands take
[15:24:08] <gnarf> and if possible, would prefer then
[15:24:15] <gnarf> but I'll ping in IRC when I'm up and moving
[15:24:52] <gnarf> we should get rworth / nacin in the loop too if they can/want to be, but mostly just about hasing out what you and I need to piece together in the next 2 days right? ":)
[15:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: This animation is wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/jtkj4/8/
[15:28:30] <scott_gonzalez> When it animates to green it's also animating to red.
[15:28:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: its animating FROM red
[15:29:10] <gnarf> because its actually red with 0 opacity
[15:29:13] <scott_gonzalez> ghetto
[15:29:38] <scott_gonzalez> Can you make it animate from green at 0?
[15:29:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: brain teaser
[15:29:55] <gnarf> so like
[15:30:05] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like if the alpha is already 0, then you should set rgb based on final.
[15:30:11] <gnarf> its rgba( 1, 0, 0, 0 )
[15:30:16] <gnarf> thats what it knows
[15:30:27] <gnarf> its going from rgba( 1, 0, 0, 0 ) to rgba( 0, 1, 0, 0 )
[15:30:33] <gnarf> its going from rgba( 1, 0, 0, 0 ) to rgba( 0, 1, 0, 1 )
[15:30:34] <gnarf> *
[15:30:54] <gnarf> of course the RGB numbers are *=255
[15:31:05] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so since the alpha is starting at 0, we can set the rgb values to match their final values.
[15:31:29] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like animating from fully transparent to anything should never cross colors.
[15:31:41] <gnarf> i agree
[15:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> I'll file an issue.
[15:32:20] <gnarf> its possible - I'm just trying to a) think of implementation, b) what impact it may have
[15:32:33] <gnarf> and i don't see any downside...
[15:32:49] <gnarf> if ( start.alpha === 0 ) { start = end.alpha( 0 ); }
[15:33:28] <gnarf> if ( start.alpha() === 0 ) { start = end.alpha( 0 ); } // my aircode is broken today :(
[15:33:48] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[15:34:10] <gnarf> that or my memory of the extra sexy api danheberden helped me come up with
[15:35:33] <gnarf> that doesn't seem like it would have any implications
[15:35:45] <gnarf> althoguh
[15:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/issues/32
[15:36:42] <gnarf> Imagine var redTrans = $.Color( 255, 0, 0, 0 ), green = $.Color( "green" ); console.log( red.transition( green, 0.5 ) );
[15:37:18] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[15:37:41] <gnarf> you still expect rgba( 0, 255, 0, 0.5 ) ?
[15:38:10] <scott_gonzalez> As the end value?
[15:38:14] <gnarf> at 0.5
[15:38:36] <gnarf> color.transition( color, distance )
[15:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> You mean rgba( 0, 128, 0, 0.5 )
[15:38:53] <scott_gonzalez> oh, nevermind
[15:38:57] <gnarf> no that would be from black trans to green opaque
[15:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> That would be 255 wouldn't it
[15:39:13] <gnarf> and actually
[15:39:17] <gnarf> what you REALLY expect
[15:39:27] <gnarf> is for it to be the background color of the div behind it
[15:39:40] <gnarf> so yeah
[15:39:47] <gnarf> thats opacity
[15:39:48] <gnarf> it sucks
[15:40:00] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think you actually want it to be the color behind.
[15:40:05] <gnarf> I dunno if you'd ever need to do that calcuation
[15:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> You want it to be green at 0 going to green at 1
[15:40:16] <gnarf> yeah
[15:40:22] <scott_gonzalez> Because the 0-1 transition gives you the fade from the behind color anyway.
[15:40:28] <gnarf> yup
[15:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> If you actually transition from the behind color you'd have the same problem we have now :-)
[15:40:44] <gnarf> but in ie6 it would actually blend with the div behind it
[15:40:52] <scott_gonzalez> Transitioning from behind is what you want when you don't have rgba support.
[15:40:57] <gnarf> yup
[15:41:15] <gnarf> so yeah - i can bake that into .transition
[15:41:42] <gnarf> it actually
[15:41:57] <gnarf> should be that if alpha === 0 - start = $.Color( "transparent" )
[15:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> As long as that does the right thing :-)
[15:45:15] <gnarf> it transitions from null -> end for colors, which picks end always
[15:45:23] <gnarf> thats why the transition TO alpha works right
[15:45:30] <gnarf> is its actually "transparent"
[15:46:13] <gnarf> whereas its rgba( 255, 0, 0, 0 ) coming in to the third animate
[15:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> Is http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6910 fixed?
[15:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> Stupid tickets with no test cases.
[15:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^
[15:56:23] <gnarf> it doesn't throw
[15:56:30] <gnarf> there is a unit
[15:56:33] <gnarf> lemme find it
[15:56:47] <gnarf> then it can have a test case - lolo
[15:57:56] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/4bd9df56f6e7f528910d8729bb42c0feeef8f64b/test/unit/color.js#L545-553
[16:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks
[16:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm going to land jquery-color in UI tonight, but I've got some changes I'd like to make. Do you mind holding off until after the conf to release 2.0?
[16:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> I think I'm going to release 1.9 then go live in the woods for the rest of my life.
[16:07:23] <scott_gonzalez> This shit is a lot more stressful than hiking to waterfalls and sitting by a fire drinking rum and making s'mores :-/
[16:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-color is massive compared to the color animation code in UI right now.
[16:13:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: how many bugs is it fixing?
[16:13:24] <gnarf> it is pretty big tho
[16:13:30] <gnarf> I can prolly compress it more
[16:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> 5
[16:13:39] <gnarf> whats total weight?
[16:13:46] <gnarf> i wasn't measuring these things then
[16:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'll check in a few minutes.
[16:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's 5x more LOC though :-P
[16:15:02] <gnarf> it also does a lot more with color in general
[16:15:27] <gnarf> like you can actually compose color values with it
[16:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[16:15:50] <gnarf> but yea
[16:15:51] <gnarf> big
[16:16:07] <gnarf> oh, and HSL support
[16:16:08] <gnarf> :)
[16:17:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://jsbin.com/odocid/edit
[16:19:06] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[16:23:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: :-/

[16:23:25] <gnarf> ouch
[16:24:01] <gnarf> I'll see what I can do now that I have grunt to size me
[16:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a few ideas. We can look into it at the conf.
[16:24:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not too worried about golfing this right now.
[16:24:30] <gnarf> maybe ask gibson to look too
[16:24:49] <gnarf> good
[16:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> If we're delaying the relase until after the conf, we can wait a few days to save some bytes.
[16:25:11] <gnarf> cuz I think we need to focus on websites :)
[16:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[16:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> This is gonna be an awesome commit though.
[16:26:08] <gnarf> Fixes #, Fixes #
[16:26:32] <gnarf> if only that could have landed during rewardjs
[16:26:35] * gnarf grins
[16:27:25] <scott_gonzalez> here it comes :-)
[16:28:18] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #553: FAILURE in 8.1 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/553/
[16:28:18] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Upgrade to jquery-color 2.0pre. Fixes #6910 - Trying to animate the background color of a document fragment can easily fail.

Fixes #5393 - getColor reports inaccurate color for transparent elements in Webkit. Fixes #3806 - Feature request: expose getRGB and getColor.
[16:29:06] <gnarf> oh boo lint
[16:29:24] <gnarf> its intentional btw
[16:30:14] <gnarf> do we need to standardize on jshintrc as a project?
[16:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[16:31:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should.
[16:31:18] <gnarf> wheres that dev leads agenda....
[16:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> I talked to rwaldron about that at the last DevDays and we brought core and UI in line.
[16:31:52] <gnarf> okay - so why was the one in my grunt not the same as the one in core/ui? :)
[16:31:57] <gnarf> and are those two still the same?
[16:33:34] <scott_gonzalez> That's the boss option?
[16:34:34] <scott_gonzalez> I thought core did this too, but they don't use boss?
[16:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...so I guess boss only cares about if() not while()
[16:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Why is that not just return colors[ string ] ?
[16:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's the last thing, so if it doesn't exist it's just going to return undefined anyway.
[16:46:27] <kswedberg> rworth: yt?
[16:46:56] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: He should be back soon.
[16:47:03] <kswedberg> k. thx scott_gonzalez
[16:47:11] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta wait for his kids to go to bed :-)
[16:47:28] <kswedberg> aha
[16:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: All tests pass with `return colors[ string ]`.
[16:49:10] * rworth will be a few more min
[16:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You're kiling me. I want to fix this now. Do I need to update UI's jshint or can I change jquery-color?
[17:09:15] <rworth> kswedberg see you on skype
[17:09:25] <kswedberg> ok!
[17:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[17:28:38] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/U_afIg
[17:28:38] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] jshint: Add boss: true to suppot jquery-color. - Scott González
[17:38:55] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[17:38:56] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #554: FIXED in 10 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/554/
[17:38:56] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: jshint: Add boss: true to suppot jquery-color.
[17:55:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah - that is just sillyness
[17:55:35] <gnarf> return colors[ string ] works
[17:55:39] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[17:56:16] <gnarf> I believe it initially did if ( string = colors[ string ] ) return stringParse( string )
[17:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> I've got it on my list :-)
[17:56:37] <scott_gonzalez> Bouncing between lots of stuff right now...
[17:56:41] <gnarf> yeah
[17:56:42] <gnarf> same
[17:56:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm really excited about the conf, but at the same time I'm going crazy.
[17:57:26] <gnarf> yeah, Its hard to judge excitement amongst the piles of stuff to worry about :)
[17:57:56] <scott_gonzalez> We're down to one ticket filed against git: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7794
[17:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> How did that actually work before?
[17:58:33] <gnarf> assumed top/left
[17:58:44] <scott_gonzalez> So it's not a regression?
[17:58:48] <gnarf> also - poorly
[17:58:53] <gnarf> :)
[17:58:54] <gnarf> no
[17:59:31] <gnarf> i think it might just be cant/wontfix
[17:59:35] <gnarf> or api
[17:59:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm going to close.
[17:59:46] <gnarf> like { position: "right bottom"
[17:59:48] <gnarf> option
[17:59:56] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing we have supports bottom/right because we can't detect.
[18:00:04] <gnarf> correct
[18:00:09] <scott_gonzalez> We can add options, but we'll want to do that in the future.
[18:00:19] <gnarf> i could prolly write a tiny function to use if you want right or bottom instead
[18:00:23] <scott_gonzalez> It even affects widgets, like draggable and resizable.
[18:00:58] <gnarf> cool
[18:01:02] <gnarf> i dont feel so bad then
[18:01:10] <gnarf> its just a top/left kinda world we're livin in
[18:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[18:02:09] <scott_gonzalez> Pretty much down to reviewing demos.
[18:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> Which is a crap ton of work.
[18:02:39] <gnarf> assuming we can make 14 websites work on wednesday, we can spend some time doing that @ the conf
[18:02:40] <gnarf> :)
[18:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, hoping to release the beta *before* the conf.
[18:03:14] <gnarf> oh
[18:03:24] <gnarf> hey - dave didn't even review pulls before releasing beta
[18:03:25] <gnarf> :)
[18:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:03:50] <gnarf> its beta
[18:03:58] <gnarf> but demos are like our docs
[18:04:00] <gnarf> so we need em
[18:04:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I guess I can just run through the demos in a few browsers for now.
[18:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> We can do a full review after the beta.
[18:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'll test in IE6/9, latest Opera, latest Firefox, latest Chrome.
[18:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> Still a lot, but only like half of the supported browsers.
[18:04:59] <rworth> nacin ping
[18:05:24] <kswedberg> nacin: we neeeeeed you! :)
[18:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> We're up to 201 tickets fixed: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?resolution=fixed&milestone=1.9&group=component
[18:08:28] <gnarf> thats pretty mental
[18:09:42] <gnarf> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7404 prolly shouldn't count ;)
[18:10:43] <gnarf> 24 in effects?
[18:10:46] <gnarf> seems nice :)
[18:11:02] <gnarf> yay accordion + autocomplete!
[18:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> About to do a batch update in Trac. I unchecked the "modify ticket changetime" checkbox, hopefully that prevents it from sending emails...
[18:21:32] <scott_gonzalez> If not, I'm really sorry for what's about to happen to everyone's inbox.
[18:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> oh boy
[18:23:04] <rworth> noiiiiiise
[18:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> No more enhancment type :-P
[18:25:43] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I need something from you
[18:25:45] <kswedberg> :)
[18:25:59] <kborchers> holy e-mail :)
[18:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Does something need to be enhanced?
[18:26:08] <scott_gonzalez> Because that's no longer possible :-)
[18:26:11] <kswedberg> yes grunt
[18:26:17] <kswedberg> grunt wordpress, to be exct
[18:26:24] <scott_gonzalez> What do you need?
[18:26:51] <scott_gonzalez> Guys, it's ok, it's only 109 emails...
[18:27:22] <kswedberg> for grunt wordpress, we need to pass post meta. meta_key: _wp_page_template
[18:27:33] <kswedberg> and meta_value: whatevs
[18:27:36] <kswedberg> can we do that?
[18:28:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i'm used to it. been signing blackberry apps for work lately and every time i do that i get about 75 e-mails … awesome system RIM
[18:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[18:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: There's support for customFields, but I don't think you can set _wp_* fields via XML-RPC.
[18:28:47] <kswedberg> hmmm. well, we need to set the page template for a page
[18:29:03] <kborchers> rworth: i'm confused by that legacy.api.jquery.com thing. i haven't dug in too deep but it works locally for me so not sure what's up
[18:29:21] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Let me test.
[18:30:08] <kswedberg> cool. thx, scott_gonzalez
[18:31:34] <rworth> kborchers did you *just* do it? Caus kswedberg just fixed a few issues
[18:32:49] <kborchers> rworth: no, it's been working for me since you first asked me to look at it this morning
[18:33:03] <rworth> weird as heck, works for jzaefferer too
[18:33:05] <kswedberg> kborchers: are you seeing all the entries on the legacy homepage?
[18:33:09] <kborchers> yep
[18:33:09] <rworth> but not for me or kswedberg
[18:34:50] <kborchers> not sure if it could make a difference but i still don't have multisite set up
[18:34:56] <kborchers> rworth kswedberg ^
[18:35:05] <rworth> ohhhhh
[18:35:11] <kswedberg> yeah, that's probably it
[18:35:12] <rworth> that very well may be
[18:35:38] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Yeah, _wp_page_template gets ignored.
[18:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> I've gotta head home. I'll dig into the WordPress source when I get home and see if I can figure out how to make this work.
[18:36:11] <kswedberg> can you unignore it?
[18:36:18] <kswedberg> :p
[18:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: possibly :-P
[18:39:44] <rworth> actually looks like it's just warnings
[18:40:07] <rworth> kborchers so kswedberg is cleaning them all up
[18:40:24] <rworth> he is using a bunch of deprecated functions and arguments
[18:40:48] <rworth> so it must be that kswedberg and I had warnings on and you and jzaefferer did not
[18:41:44] <kborchers> rworth kswedberg ok. when those are fixed if it's still not working let me know and i'll be happy to look into it
[18:41:51] <rworth> thanks
[18:41:59] <kborchers> rworth anything else you need me to dig into tonight/tomorrow?
[18:43:29] <rworth> kborchers there are a few github issues in api.jqueryui.com
[18:43:53] <rworth> and you could document the ui object in all the events. It's still in the overview/longdesc
[18:44:08] <rworth> except I fixed it for droppable
[18:44:57] <rworth> whatever you do there, make sure you cherry-pick to the 1-8 branch caus that's what we'll take live until 1.9 is final
[18:46:32] <kborchers> rworth ok, i have some other work to do tonight then i can probably jump on something later tonight
[18:46:45] <rworth> ok
[18:47:47] <kborchers> now i get to switch back to windows to work on more blackberry stuff
[18:48:06] <kborchers> such a pain
[19:00:02] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Oh, blackberry stuff? I've got something for you :-)
[19:00:21] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8364
[19:00:24] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8363
[19:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is there a way to make XML-RPC allow you to set _wp_page_template?
[19:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> I can't seem to find where it's getting filtered out.
[19:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like it's deep in the code, possibly behind a filter :-P
[19:12:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/net.html#net_server_close_cb
[19:13:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you could code a -HUP signal handler
[19:13:17] <gnarf> that closed itself and then spawned itself
[19:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[19:14:05] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we can do that for the closing part, but if we wait for that to kill itself and then have forever kick off a new process, we'll miss a few requests inbetween.
[19:15:13] <gnarf> agree, unless we have multiples
[19:15:24] <gnarf> HUP one, leave the others running
[19:15:38] <gnarf> nginx should realize the port isn't accepting and move to another proxy as it restarts
[19:15:54] <gnarf> or
[19:16:12] <gnarf> we make the "startup" sequence retry listen on error for some number of seconds
[19:16:21] <gnarf> like 5 seconds until it truely gives up
[19:16:28] <gnarf> then we start new, and hup old
[19:17:52] <gnarf> http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/net.html#net_server_listen_port_host_backlog_listeninglistener
[19:20:39] <gnarf> hrm
[19:20:43] <gnarf> it can use sockets?
[19:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: I've got an update coming...
[19:23:47] <kswedberg> awesome! thx, scott_gonzalez
[19:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> This will mean that every site will need to upgrade grunt-wordpress though :-P
[19:25:30] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: This is on an actual page, correct?
[19:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> type = "page"
[19:26:16] <kswedberg> yes
[19:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> oh crap
[19:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> Let's just pretend I didn't make a mess in web-base-template...
[19:33:32] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: If you update to grunt-wordpres 1.0.1 and pull web-base-tempalte, you should be good to go.
[19:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> Just add pageTemplate: "whatever" in the metadata.
[19:33:46] <kswedberg> awesome!
[19:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> Man, I was doing pretty well with typing today, it's starting to go downhill.
[19:42:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the "camping effect" wearing off?
[19:43:57] <scott_gonzalez> I guess so, brain is starting to melt after 12.5 hours of work today.
[19:45:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: go cook a hotdog to repair it
[19:45:43] <gnarf> :)
[19:46:08] <gnarf> or a smore
[19:46:13] <gnarf> thats prolly a better idea
[20:27:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez were you serious about looking at those bugs? i just came back to mac land and saw your messages. i don't have my irc client set up on windows as i want to spend as little time there as possible
