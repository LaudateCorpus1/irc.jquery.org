[13:55:30] <petersendidit> is there an easy way to search the irc logs for this chanel? I know they are on irc.jquery.com but don't see anyway to search
[14:35:58] <_zoggy_> what are you searching for
[14:42:09] <petersendidit> conversation I had a few weeks ago, know the topic but not the day that it happened
[14:46:05] <_zoggy_> 2013-02-12 07:02:17 <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: if the regex is /[\+\-]\d+(\.[\d]+)?%?/ I can't seem think of something that will match the regex and produce a NaN
[14:46:13] <_zoggy_> that conversation?
[14:47:36] <petersendidit> No asked scott about the slider rewrite, he gave a link with the few thoughts that were document but can't find that link anymore
[14:48:13] <petersendidit> what are you doing to search?
[14:48:31] <_zoggy_> searching my logs
[14:48:55] <petersendidit> ah
[14:49:11] <petersendidit> seems like it would be nice to have a search on irc.jquery.com

[14:53:38] <_zoggy_> https://pastee.org/e2hwk
