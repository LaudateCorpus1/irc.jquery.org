[03:17:33] <agcolom> kborchers: Good morning :-) I'd say that there are 2 options: responsive font sizes as you have already suggested or cut the function name at a suitable point, just before an uppercase. However, the risk is that if the name is cut, people may get confused... but a function name is always 1 word so maybe not...
[05:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Read this paragraph at the top: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/docs/manifest.md
[05:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: The reason I'm trying to get you to understand this from the docs is to find what's missing from the docs.
[05:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> If you read this multiple times and the file naming isn't obvious, then we need to fix that.
[05:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> I know you're not an idiot :-)

[07:34:33] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I've read it at least 5 times and I don't understand the naming convention as it pertains to the relationship between the manifest and the file that it's associated with :(
[07:34:47] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: it might be that the ui examples are confusing
[07:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: There's no association between the manifest file and the source file.
[07:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> The manifest file contains metadata about a plugin, it doesn't matter where in the repo that plugin is.
[07:35:35] <scott_gonzalez> The name of the file is determined by the name of the plugin that it is about.
[07:36:11] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: how does the plugin website "serve" the correct file when a given plugin is requested?
[07:36:38] <johnbender> it sounds like I have some broken pre-conceived notions
[07:36:57] <scott_gonzalez> The plugins site doesn't serve files.
[07:37:23] <johnbender> now I'm definitely confused
[07:37:35] <scott_gonzalez> There are download links, but they don't point to the plugins site.
[07:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> By default they point to GitHub-generated zips of the tags.
[07:37:52] <johnbender> so the plugin website is just generates a list of deps for the user?
[07:37:58] <scott_gonzalez> You can change that (like UI does) by providing a different URL.
[07:38:10] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: The plugins site is about discovering plugins.
[07:38:10] <johnbender> s/is//
[07:38:15] <johnbender> ok
[07:38:20] <johnbender> that makes everything much clearer
[07:38:41] <johnbender> I was under the impression that it would give you the actual deps
[07:38:46] <johnbender> like a global download builder
[07:39:06] <johnbender> assumption fail :(

[14:36:18] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ping
[14:36:22] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: hey
[14:36:38] <scott_gonzalez> hey nacin, got a sec to look at an Apache problem?
[14:36:43] <nacin> yep
[14:40:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yea?
[14:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> We're trying to figure out why the designer's dev install isn't working.
[14:41:31] <scott_gonzalez> He can get to the dev sites, but not to sub-pages.
[14:41:38] <scott_gonzalez> Although he can get to sub-pages inside wp-admin
[14:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> nacin is looking at it right now (we're screensharing).
[14:42:10] <gnarf> AllowOverride All ?
[14:42:16] <gnarf> so the .htaccess rewrite works?
[14:43:21] <gnarf> http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#allowoverride -- needs to be in the <Directory> in the httpd.conf / virtualhost defininiton
[14:54:48] <nacin> the rewrite doesn't work
[14:54:58] <nacin> it doesn't appear to be reading .htaccess at all
[14:55:00] <nacin> the joys of MAMP
[15:16:48] <gnarf> nacin: scott_gonzalez: ^^^ is AllowOverride All on ?
[15:17:12] <gnarf> or check the other directive, that changes the name of .htaccess
[15:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We checked both of those.
