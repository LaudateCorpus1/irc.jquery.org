[06:42:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[06:43:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey! About the three remaining PRs.
[06:43:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I don't think I'll be able to complete the unit test for the resetActivePageHeight() one.
[06:43:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[06:43:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You said we should merge Ian's PR this morning.
[06:43:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[06:43:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and Lisa's latest PR needs reviewing.
[06:44:39] <arschmitz> did she update it?
[06:44:44] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I believe so.
[06:44:48] <arschmitz> ok 
[06:45:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll pull Ian's PR into a branch and do a second PR to correct the whitespace problems.
[06:49:24] <arschmitz> ok

[07:02:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i have something i really needto show you
[07:02:53] <arschmitz> i just need to finish something else first
[07:05:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm all eyes.
[07:05:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: here ill just gist it real quick
[07:07:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/24141639de2239ca57e9
[07:07:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its not 100% done yet but you get the idea
[07:10:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I've done exactly that with my optionsToClasses: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/e701ae575d583a55fbacfd5db4fa96055a987533
[07:10:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: theres a lot more involved with yours
[07:11:13] <arschmitz> on each widget
[07:11:17] <arschmitz> and it handles them differently
[07:12:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: On some widgets, some boolean style options affect one element while others affect another.
[07:12:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i looked at every widget and they are always .widget()
[07:12:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: For example, on selectmenu, ui-mini is applied to the wrapper, whereas corners and shadow are applied to the button.
[07:13:05] <gabriel_schulhof> No.
[07:13:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Not for select.
[07:13:37] <arschmitz> thats wasy to special case with out all the extra processing
[07:13:46] <arschmitz> and extra buy in
[07:14:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, yeah. It's true that I was going to gradually try to concentrate the code in one extension, after making sure that it works for all widgets. I guess you've taken the extra step of doing that.
[07:16:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i also realized it would be easy to do the same for theme
[07:16:29] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: this also mad me realize they should have worked like this all along instead of being handled in each widget
[07:20:14] <sfrisk> No time like the present to fix it.
[07:20:30] <arschmitz> sfrisk: with the deprecation of it lol?
[07:20:43] <sfrisk> :-p
[07:20:57] <arschmitz> sfrisk: progress!
[07:20:57] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: There's also the issue of inset. Corners depends on inset.
[07:21:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we have talked about changing how inset works
[07:21:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and we should make it override corners on the css level 
[07:22:14] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: actually inset is not deprecated
[07:22:33] <gabriel_schulhof> It isn't? It's a boolean style option.
[07:22:44] <arschmitz> its not a style option
[07:22:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its not theme
[07:23:11] <arschmitz> its just a boolean option
[07:23:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, OK. That certainly makes the code simpler.
[07:23:30] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: I think we can close this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4195
[07:25:11] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz closed issue #4195: <img> tags that use full URL are corrupted when the page is located in a subdirectory and <base> points to a different directoy 02http://git.io/9gLMWg
[07:27:13] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: thanks.  this one too: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4908
[07:28:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: There's also a problem with using a regex to modify the value of a class list. Since the class list may contain classes by any name, you must make sure you remove exactly the class you want. There may be a user-generated class ui-button-inline-green or something, in which case you might mangle that.
[07:28:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thts just a problem with my regex not any regex
[07:28:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's why I went with .split( " " ) and exact string comparison.
[07:28:49] <arschmitz> thats easy to fix
[07:29:46] <lisa_deluca> gabriel_schulhof: is this one of those issues that got lost in the system?  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5100

[07:32:02] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: Lemme check if that is still the case.
[07:32:45] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, yeah ... that'll still happen, because we treat the query string as being part of what makes the page URL unique.
[07:33:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, we consider index.html?abc to be a completely different page than index.html?def
[07:34:24] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: we can probably close this one too: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3872#issuecomment-60932996

[07:40:27] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Before I start re-writing the classes implementations, could you please update ui-1-12 with the checkboxradio fix? I'd like the re-implementation to be fully testable along the way. It feels eery working without tests.
[07:41:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Four years ago I wouldn't've believed it if I had heard myself say that :)

[10:00:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'm looking through some old PRs. Any idea what's going on here? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/919 - was there communication with the team for those changes?
[10:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[10:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> But I certainly wasn't paying attention to the sortable rewrite.
[10:02:03] <jzaefferer> so what are we doing with that PR? Leave it open for a few more years..?
[10:02:24] <scott_gonzalez> Well I'm not doing anything with the interactions rewrite right now.
[11:34:43] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: you were working on button, but want to finish classes update first before pushing button upddates? did I get that right?
[11:34:58] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: well the backcompat stuff you pointed out in classes
[11:35:01] <arschmitz> isthe same in button
[11:35:21] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: so i wanted to update that to work the ways its supposed to 
[11:36:42] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i had copied the way backcompat worked from the original classes PR so its all the same. I got clairification from scott this morning and he pointed me at an example in 1.9 so im updating it in both places based on that
[11:37:28] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i updated everything from your last review but figured since the things from the classes review corssed over you would want me to get all the updated that needed to be done first before you reviewed again
[11:38:46] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: okay, sounds good. Let me know when its ready
[11:38:54] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: will do

[15:05:43] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: i wish git hub seperated that ability from full commit access
[15:06:07] <arschmitz> so we could have non team members help in that way they can do that with trac of course since its completely seperate
