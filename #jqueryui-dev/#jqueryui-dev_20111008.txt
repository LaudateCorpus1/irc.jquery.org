[04:37:09] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tooltip demo: Use position option in tracking demo. - Scott Gonz√°lez
[05:02:17] <gnarf> so jzaefferer - what other grid tasks are there on the short list?
[05:05:36] <jzaefferer> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40076546/Grid-CustomInputs
[05:06:08] <jzaefferer> I'd like to land Hans' last updates for Datepicker before doing anything else on that
[05:06:28] <jzaefferer> Checkbox/Radiobuttons should be somewhat easy to get done, there already is some code in place
[05:06:54] <jzaefferer> not sure about datetime picker, thats mostly a research task for now
[05:07:43] <jzaefferer> othen then that, we should start with speccing/planning stage 4 tasks: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid#Stage4GridPluginAddons
[05:08:17] <jzaefferer> column resizing and reordering will probably uncover various bugs in the current markup; the scroll handling doesn't even work that well anyway
[05:08:58] <gnarf> just wondering what I should move on to
[05:14:15] <jzaefferer> let's get checkbox and radiobutton done: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137730/Checkbox http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138030/Radiobutton
[05:14:46] <gnarf> k
[05:14:54] <gnarf> should i be looking to steal code from mobile for that
[05:14:58] <gnarf> or do we already hav esomething?
[05:15:08] <jzaefferer> we've got something on the formcontrols branch
[05:15:24] <jzaefferer> but we might as well scrap that
[05:21:28] <gnarf> K - I'll dig into the mobile way
