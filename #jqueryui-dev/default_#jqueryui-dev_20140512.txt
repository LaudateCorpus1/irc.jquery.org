[00:10:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[00:10:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[00:11:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Are we ever gonna do https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6584
[00:11:23] <_|Nix|_> >
[00:11:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is it even relevant still?
[00:13:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I think we should land it
[00:14:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: after testing if we can reproduce the issue
[00:14:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but who has safari <= 5 anymore?
[00:15:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the PR is not to fix an issue with Safari 5
[00:16:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the PR reverts a fix for Safari 5, to fix a problem with screen readers
[00:16:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, but then we must test whether the issue then re-emerges for Safari 5, right? Wait: Do we even support Safari 5?
[00:17:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[00:17:24] <_|Nix|_> I guess we do.
[00:17:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we support Mobile Safari 5 
[00:17:40] <uGoMobi> because iPad 1 can't run 6
[00:17:55] <_|Nix|_> Right. Lemme see if BS has Safari 5.
[00:18:43] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... it has "iPad" with iOS 3.2 - which we don't support, because we don't support iOS < 4, right?
[00:18:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so we should test if issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380 occurs on the iPad 1 as well
[00:19:14] <_|Nix|_> Hold on ... do we support iOS === 4? I thought we dropped that.
[00:19:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/1.4/
[00:19:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've looked, and yes. The support is there. So, I need an iPad with iOS >= 4.0.0 and Safari 5.
[00:20:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... BS doesn't have an iPad 1 with iOS >= 4.0.0
[00:20:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz has an iPad that runs iOS5 if I am not mistaken
[00:20:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, as long as it's Safari 5 I guess, right?
[00:21:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but even if we can reproduce (after reverting the fix) we probably should land the PR anyway
[00:21:25] <uGoMobi> and see if we can come up with another fix
[00:22:11] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[00:22:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well, the issue was reported for desktop Safari 5
[00:22:25] <_|Nix|_> That's gonna be fun to test.
[00:22:43] <_|Nix|_> I think I can install it on my Windoze box, because Safari >= 6 is not available for Windoze.
[00:23:13] <_|Nix|_> I've tried installing Safari for Windoze once, and it worked. Lessee if it'll work again.
[00:23:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I have Safari on Windows here
[00:24:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, that's desktop safari 5, so *wipe hands*
[00:24:43] <uGoMobi> version 5.1.7
[00:25:08] <uGoMobi> yeah, was more curious what happens on iPad
[00:25:28] <_|Nix|_> Well, I can comment about desktop, and arschmitz can add the result from his iPad.
[00:25:42] <_|Nix|_> ... or you can comment about desktop, if you have the time.
[00:25:55] <_|Nix|_> ... since you already have it running, whereas I still have to get it set up.
[00:26:23] <_|Nix|_> I'm planning on taking a break for breakfast and then getting started with Windoze.
[00:26:51] <uGoMobi> I have to leave soon too but I can test it now
[00:26:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will comment
[00:27:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome! Thanks!
[02:17:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Since applying https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6584 causes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380 to resurface, should we not apply https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6584 and re-open https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380?
[02:18:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That way, we're un-breaking a lot of browsers (apparently) while re-breaking Safari 5 - which seems to reduce the breakage.
[02:18:29] <_|Nix|_> I mean, it seems like a reduction in breakage.

[06:54:37] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[06:54:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sure. In a sec.
[06:55:57] <_|Nix|_> http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/table.html
[06:56:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Works on Safari 5.1.7 on Windows, where I was able to reproduce https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380.
[06:56:32] <arschmitz> ok
[06:56:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The big question is, does a screen reader correctly identify the table as a table?
[06:57:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can't tell the difference using orca. It reads the page the same way, whether the display is set to table-row-group or not set at all or set to "initial".
[06:57:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: i don't actually have an ios 5 ipad anymore it was my wifes and she upgraded :)
[06:57:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok just give me a sec to finish typing an email
[06:57:41] <_|Nix|_> Well, then I guess all we can do is Safari 5.1.7/Windoze, which I've already tested.
[06:58:53] <_|Nix|_> If display: initial; turns out to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380 in a different way, then the next question is whether it also fixes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6583, thus providing a better solution than https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6584
[06:59:24] <_|Nix|_> To answer that question we need a screen reader that can tell the difference between display: initial and display: table-column-group;
[07:00:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have voice over the one it was reported on
[07:00:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I also have orca, but when I open the page in FF, orca reads it the same way whether display is set to initial, unset, or set to table-row-group
[07:00:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Might be orca's fault.
[07:01:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I need a screen reader where there's a difference.
[07:01:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If your screen reader reports a difference, then excellent!
[07:01:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have to go now. Might be back in a few hours.
[07:01:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have no idea but i have Voice Over which is the screen reader the problem was reported on
[07:20:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no that makes the table terrible and insane!
[07:24:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: display: initial makes the table terrible and insane? Is it visually terrible and insane or screen-reader-whise?
[07:24:14] <arschmitz> yes
[07:24:18] <arschmitz> screen reader
[07:25:03] <arschmitz> it does not see it as a table and just goes off reading all the cells at once and even reads the hidden ones
[07:25:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So it sounds like the only screen-reader-friendly option is to not have anything specified.
[07:25:41] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:25:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Meaning we need to go ahead with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6584 and do ... something ... to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380.
[07:26:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah 5380 i think is much less important
[07:26:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... something not involving the display CSS property :/
[07:26:45] <arschmitz> if we find something great but we drop ios5 support very soon anywa
[07:28:06] <arschmitz> unless im mistaken we drop it in 1.5 but not remove anything until at least 1.7
[07:30:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh actually we apparently are not even accepting bug fixes for it any more :)
[07:30:45] <arschmitz> http://blog.jquery.com/2014/04/02/browser-support-in-jquery-1-12-and-beyond/
[07:30:54] <arschmitz> we are taking the same support route so is ui

[10:54:33] <_|Nix|_> frequent: What's up?
[10:55:14] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hey. I'm fighting with a panel issue and was wondering if it ever cropped up in issues:
[10:55:50] <frequent> _|Nix|_: was there an issue where a panel opened and then was "shrunk" like if the viewport did not work? 
[10:55:58] <frequent> _|Nix|_: on iOS7
[10:56:10] <arschmitz> frequent: shrunk?
[10:56:57] <frequent> _|Nix|_: 1sec (looking for link example)
[10:56:58] <arschmitz> frequent: you might be of interest though with a new panel widget i started working on
[10:57:25] <arschmitz> frequent: its not quite done yet but it already looks a lot better then the current one

[11:06:40] <arschmitz> frequent: i dont recall one
[11:08:54] <frequent> arschmitz: ok. Still thanks! May I ask which Chrome desktop version are you using?
[11:08:57] <arschmitz> frequent: do you have a bunch of custom media queries in your theme.css?
[11:09:07] <frequent> arschmitz: yes, a ton
[11:09:13] <arschmitz> thats it
[11:09:20] <frequent> ohoh
[11:09:22] <arschmitz> you have a bunch of font-size: 95% 
[11:09:25] <arschmitz> stuff like that
[11:09:32] <arschmitz> font-size: 92.5%
[11:09:59] <arschmitz> so your changing the font-size of the text in your button 
[11:10:01] <frequent> arschmitz: yup
[11:10:02] <arschmitz> make it look shrunk
[11:10:47] <arschmitz> and im on chrome 34
[11:10:53] <frequent> arschmitz: ok. good pointer as well. Thanks
[11:11:17] <arschmitz> but its only if you shrink the window enough to kick in the media queries
[11:11:46] <frequent> arschmitz: ok. I will have a look. Hope that's it, because this is easy to fix :-)
[11:12:09] <arschmitz> frequent: i unchecked them all in inspector and the button looked fine after
