[01:52:19] <rxaviers> gd morning
[02:37:54] <rxaviers> gnarf, very cool patch. Caching image generation gave it a boost in loading speed
[02:44:52] <ALEKS134> hallo!
[02:46:18] <ALEKS134> anyone here could give me a sort tutorial* about how to use implement/updated on wordpress?  im soo noob ;(
[02:46:39] <ALEKS134> tryed couple of methods but nothing works
[02:47:39] <ALEKS134> i did generate nice layout on your website & download them,  on my wordpress p wordpress post tabs is installed 
[02:48:12] <ALEKS134> downloaded file looks like   jquery-ui-1.10.0.custom  and thats all i know for now
[02:55:58] <ALEKS134> no one?  ;(

[03:52:29] <gnarf> rxaviers: there was an issue though
[03:52:45] <gnarf> rxaviers: the actual themeroller was broken on jqueryui.com
[03:52:51] <gnarf> maybe i needed to deploy there too?
[03:53:26] <rxaviers> yeap, we do.
[03:53:45] <rxaviers> Im making a few changes
[03:53:49] <gnarf> k
[03:53:54] <rxaviers> and can do that
[03:55:01] <gnarf> rxaviers: as far as GC goes
[03:55:05] <gnarf> I'm thinking just a cron
[03:55:15] <rxaviers> cool! ;) alright
[03:55:26] <gnarf> though ,i kinda wanna let it just grow for a while
[03:55:31] <gnarf> and see how big it gets too
[03:55:37] <rxaviers> makes sense

[05:34:49] <rxaviers> gnarf, ready to see it in action? ^
[05:34:50] <rxaviers> :)
[05:40:16] <rxaviers> gnarf, wow, we're stable now
[05:40:43] <rxaviers> great idea caching those images. I think we'd have not done without it
[05:44:32] <rxaviers> gnarf, i've encapsulated filename creation into Image, and I've made it a class. http://git.io/B6GcIA

[05:48:09] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, I just figured out why so many people have the "Grr, why isn't the JQueryUI theme builder working.  I need to create some themes." tweet.
[05:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's undirected twitter spam.
[05:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> There are tons of bots copying tweets from random users.
[05:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> In hopes that people will come across them via searches and look at their profile.
[05:49:53] <scott_gonzalez> The profiles have tinyurls that point to whatever site they're trying to lure people too.
[05:54:21] <rxaviers> af
[05:54:41] <rxaviers> guys, now we get no more timeout errors, CPU load is stable.

[06:36:25] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: if the image cache on disk is just 6MB, why bother writing it to disk?
[06:37:06] <jzaefferer> even with different encoding in memory, it shouldn't more than double
[06:38:45] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you're quite irritated me there for a second referring to git as "he". I still consider git a tool as "it" ;)
[06:43:52] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: we have a download every five minutes, but how many people are concurrently using themeroller? I suspects that's more than downloads. Can you look into getting a number for that into Splunk? Probably would've helped estimating the load in image generation as well. Maybe log the (number of) image requests as a metric for TR activity.
[06:48:37] <gnarf> jzaefferer: stored on disk because i wasn't sure how big the cache would get
[06:48:41] <gnarf> wanted to give it room to grow
[06:48:46] <gnarf> and check on it in a few days
[06:49:03] <gnarf> memory might be just fine
[06:58:37] <DaveMethvin> gnarf scott_gonzalez: what should i do to edit the index.html in code.jquery.com?
[06:58:58] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: download it, edit it, upload it :(
[06:59:02] <gnarf> working on fixing that
[06:59:05] <gnarf> but keep setting it down
[06:59:08] <gnarf> need to finish it
[06:59:17] <DaveMethvin> oh np i just saw a template and got scared :)
[07:00:05] <DaveMethvin> is there a reason why we have zipped copies of the older builds in that dir?
[07:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> cuz peeps be crazy
[07:00:32] <DaveMethvin> at some point around jquery 1.4 it looks like we stopped doing that
[07:00:32] <gnarf> because we have zipped copies of older builds
[07:00:36] <gnarf> yeah
[07:00:39] <DaveMethvin> which is good
[07:00:42] <gnarf> i wanted to talk about that and other things today
[07:00:49] <DaveMethvin> it just seems strange to have it in the cdn
[07:01:05] <DaveMethvin> because that's c that we don't want to dn
[07:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> I read the first part of that sentence a few times trying to figure out how you screwed up your typing so badly.
[07:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> Then I got to the end and realized you didn't screw up at all :-P
[07:03:48] <DaveMethvin> lol
[07:04:03] <DaveMethvin> gotta keep you on your toes
[07:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> Being on my toes would be an improvement from the laying on my back that I've been doing for the past three days.
[07:04:39] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #951: STILL FAILING in 46 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/951/
[07:06:08] <DaveMethvin> so just so i'm sure i don't mess this up, should i be editing ../versioned-htdocs/index.html?
[07:06:45] <DaveMethvin> looks like Krinkle may have been working on this about a week ago
[07:07:25] <scott_gonzalez>  /var/www/code.origin.jquery.com/htdocs/index.html
[07:07:47] <DaveMethvin> which links to ../versioned-htdocs/index.html
[07:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> huh
[07:08:40] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle 1/20/2013
[07:08:47] <gnarf> is it a mini git repo
[07:08:48] <gnarf> cuz if so
[07:08:50] <gnarf> i support this
[07:09:00] <gnarf> at least we have a backup
[07:09:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah i just didn't know it was going on
[07:09:10] <gnarf> not sure myself
[07:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> It is indeed a mini git repo.
[07:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> So, yes, edit that file.
[07:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> It's a repo of just the index.
[07:11:10] <DaveMethvin> so i was just going to copy edit and copy back, do i need to ssh in and commit the change?
[07:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> Would probably be good.
[07:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> Though until this is fully setup, I don't think it's too important.
[07:16:26] <DaveMethvin> i would like to see this auto-generate or be triggered by script rather than us needing to edit it ... the patterns for the files names are pretty consistent
[07:16:49] <DaveMethvin> but imma stop whining and edit this :D
[07:18:46] <scott_gonzalez> That's the goal.
[07:35:50] <gnarf> goal is
[07:36:09] <gnarf> you commit the new files to the .git repo locally, push to github, and it deploys and generates
[07:36:37] <gnarf> not directly upload to origin
[08:58:35] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, did you have a chance to read the TR/DB UI/mobile integration I sent you?
[08:58:51] <rxaviers> (..email* I sent...)
[09:02:17] <rxaviers> A full merge is something very long term. But, to separate the common parts and avoid duplicate now is something very feasible. I can make that happen from our side and I think it will help us on the mobile/UI integration.
[09:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I haven't read it too cloesly yet, but I'd like to get our code stable before moving everything around.
[09:12:16] <rxaviers> when you have some time, we cal talk about this
[09:12:23] <rxaviers> anytime works for me
[09:12:27] <rxaviers> (virtually)
[09:12:28] <rxaviers> :)
[09:14:53] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, my proposal is not to rewrite our code. But, make parts external so we both projects can use and improve.
[09:15:08] <scott_gonzalez> Let's get our code stable first.
[09:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> We don't need more moving parts right now.
[09:31:02] <fnagel> Where to post feature / change requests for non released UI widgets? The specific Wiki page, right?

[09:57:07] <jzaefferer> not too shabby
[10:01:51] <jzaefferer> fnagel: yeah, wiki is the right place. For discussion, forum and IRC also work.
[10:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'll work on the dialog failures.
[10:03:44] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'm just looking at it
[10:03:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:03:58] <jzaefferer> I may come running for help though :p
[10:04:18] <jzaefferer> I've got it green already, now to figure out why it fails here but works for non-deprecated
[10:06:52] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: this works, but I don't know why it fails in the first place: https://gist.github.com/1eb580cb8b2e9012b16e - we've only got backCompat for the old position options in place
[10:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> Taht doesn't make any sense.
[10:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the reason it fails is probably because the effects files aren't loaded.
[10:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> But it doesn't make sense that the changes in that gist would fix it.
[10:09:46] <jzaefferer> Actually, it does. When effects are loaded, the focus callback, via _show, is triggered synchronously. So the element is defined yet.
[10:10:03] <jzaefferer> Which is probably a bug in ui.widget's _show method.
[10:10:20] <jzaefferer> or in effects?
[10:11:01] <jzaefferer> including effects in the deprecated suite also fixes the issue
[10:11:58] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think that's a bug.
[10:12:18] <scott_gonzalez> If there is no effect to run, why shouldn't it by sync?
[10:13:25] <jzaefferer> Do we want to have a callback that can be both sync and async, depending on what other components are loaded?
[10:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> Well, $.fx.off makes animation calls sync.
[10:14:57] <jzaefferer> So without effects in place, we end up in the else branch that calls element.queue, in widget's _show implementation
[10:15:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how this is any different.
[10:16:44] <jzaefferer> http://api.jquery.com/queue/#queue2 doesn't say anything about executing sync when the queue is empty
[10:16:57] <jzaefferer> I'll just add the effects files to the deprecated html file to fix the failures

[10:21:40] <rxaviers> guys quick question
[10:21:48] <rxaviers> what would you use to mv files? grunt or http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8579055/how-i-move-files-on-node-js ?
[10:22:23] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what's the context?
[10:22:27] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/commit/aed3097caf6a45f3fda54fa0a33eb7d29fb5247e
[10:22:28] <b-ot> rxaviers: Corey Frang (15h 22m ago): Image Caching Layer
[10:22:29] <jzaefferer> inside a grunt task, sure, grunt
[10:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> fs.rename()
[10:22:55] <rxaviers> ah!
[10:22:58] <rxaviers> thks
[10:23:05] <rxaviers> well
[10:23:17] <scott_gonzalez> Creating steams would defeat the purpose.
[10:23:34] <rxaviers> yeap, scott_gonzalez you right
[10:24:10] <rxaviers> I would use "temp" to create the tmp path, it uses TMP env
[10:24:13] <rxaviers> which is /tmp
[10:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'd just use a different file extension
[10:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> Like .cache
[10:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> Or .tmp
[10:25:33] <rxaviers> but, then I need to veryfy if the file exists
[10:25:37] <rxaviers> to avoid overlaping
[10:25:53] <rxaviers> let me check if I can use stream in graphc magick
[10:29:18] <rxaviers> Stream wont help. We're already doing this. We are exactly talking about the concurrency that may happen between the time it takes to write the file
[10:30:06] <scott_gonzalez> Except that adding a temp file means that you can know that the file is in the process of being written.
[10:30:24] <scott_gonzalez> So you can either generate the image and stream out to the user, without writing to disk.
[10:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> Or you can wait until the file is fully written.
[10:30:45] <scott_gonzalez> But the point is that we can actually detect this case now.
[10:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> Like I said, the sync writing is fine for now.
[10:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> A proper solution is going to require quite a bit more logic.
[10:32:00] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: A few exceptions are no more: http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/
[10:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> I saw :-)

[10:33:50] <doesallmagic> joern.zaefferer: Dialog: Add effect files to deprecated testsuite to sync with non-deprecated file
[10:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm already watching that :-)
[10:36:19] <rxaviers> Another solution is to track that in memory using a `lock` hash object. Seems more precise.
[10:36:37] <rxaviers> will draft the code and let you guys know
[10:36:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, we can do that too, just make sure it will work properly across restarts.
[10:37:04] <scott_gonzalez> For example, in the case of a crash during a write.
[10:37:28] <scott_gonzalez> We wouldn't want to be serving the partially written file.
[10:37:40] <scott_gonzalez> Which is another benefit of writing to a tmp file.
[10:37:51] <gnarf> write to tmp
[10:37:55] <gnarf> move it into place
[10:37:58] <gnarf> ?
[10:38:07] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:38:10] <gnarf> seems fair
[10:38:16] <gnarf> i mean
[10:38:23] <gnarf> how big is that cache folder now
[10:38:24] <rxaviers> the time it takes to move is exactly yhe the time it takes to write from buffer to file
[10:38:28] <rxaviers> doesnt solve the problem
[10:38:44] <scott_gonzalez> What problem does it not solve?
[10:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> A rename is atomic.
[10:38:52] <rxaviers> concurrency
[10:38:52] <scott_gonzalez> Is it not?
[10:39:01] <rxaviers> If in the same fs
[10:39:10] <scott_gonzalez> It has to be in the same fs, it's the same directory.
[10:39:20] <rxaviers> not if we use temp 
[10:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> I already told you not to do that.
[10:39:28] <gnarf> rename is atomic
[10:39:44] <gnarf> cache is at 40 megs now
[10:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You said you'd write to TMP, I said to use a differnet extension instead.
[10:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> The important thing is for the existence of the final file to be an accurate indicator that the file is legit.
[10:40:47] <gnarf> write to .cache.tmp - rename to .cache
[10:41:15] <gnarf> I'm just wondering if we should just store this in a closure
[10:41:31] <gnarf> skip the files altogether
[10:41:43] <rxaviers> If we skip any concurrent write to a temp file, it may work.
[10:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> We can do everything in memory, but we'll want to have a timer that clears old data.
[10:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> Because it will continue to grow.
[10:42:24] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I've found a way to at least link to the latest console output in job page: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/ - still not in all of the jobs
[10:42:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but like "continue to grow" to what end i suppose
[10:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Probably close to linear.
[10:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> This is every single change from every single user.
[10:43:19] <gnarf> lets see where the file cache is at after a week or so
[10:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> For example, open TR and move a color picker around.
[10:43:33] <scott_gonzalez> Every time you stop moving, new images are generated.
[10:43:37] <gnarf> yeah
[10:43:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: would be pretty easy to set an expires on it too
[10:44:15] <gnarf> hold an image for like 24hrs
[10:44:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, can just be a setTimeout().
[10:44:31] <gnarf> check every hour or so for stale ones
[10:44:45] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, gnarf, what do you suggest? Write to .cache.tmp file if it does not exist? When it's written, rename? If .cache.tmp exists, simply skip it and serve the generated?
[10:45:16] <rxaviers> guys, it's damn easy to write a cron that cleans cache using find -atime
[10:45:17] <gnarf> if .cache doesn't exist, write to .cache.tmp rename to .cache and serve, if .cache exists, serve
[10:45:21] <rxaviers> easy*
[10:45:35] <gnarf> rxaviers: yeah, i know - that was the plan in the first place for cleaning up the files cache
[10:45:37] <rxaviers> gnarf, nope, Im talking about .cache.tmp existing
[10:45:42] <gnarf> overwrite it
[10:45:43] <gnarf> fuck it
[10:46:03] <gnarf> you could actually do it a step better
[10:46:05] <rxaviers> cant it mess up things?
[10:46:11] <gnarf> if there is a "generator" for an image already running
[10:46:17] <gnarf> just hook its callback
[10:46:21] <gnarf> and pass it to two callbacks
[10:46:59] <gnarf> but, if the size of this cache is "RAM sized" 
[10:47:17] <gnarf> we might as well just throw out all the fs code and store it in a struct that has expires and gets cleaned
[10:49:23] <scott_gonzalez> You don't want to overwrite a temp file.
[10:49:47] <gnarf> well if you kept track of the "generators" you could add a callbacks queue
[10:49:54] <scott_gonzalez> You need something tracking the files that are in the process of being written.
[10:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> right
[10:50:00] <gnarf> so only one generator per cache file is ever possible
[10:50:15] <gnarf> any subsequent in that window will get the same output
[10:51:01] <gnarf> at that point, don't even need the .tmp
[10:51:11] <rxaviers> If it crashes writing the tmp file, we need to know to re-write it. Or we'll never cache that anymore.
[10:51:33] <rxaviers> so, we need a combo of writing this temp file + having in memory hash object.
[10:52:03] <gnarf> yeah, i can get on that
[10:52:13] <gnarf> shouldn't be too hard to put on top of what i had
[10:56:17] <rxaviers> a draft https://gist.github.com/4693261
[10:56:39] <rxaviers> removing the temp from package.json of course
[11:01:17] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, gnarf, I think the above solves it.. comments?
[11:04:57] <gnarf> that won't actually send the data via the callbacks tho
[11:04:58] <gnarf> check it
[11:05:19] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/a205df4ba9f4c0355358
[11:06:07] <rxaviers> why not?
[11:06:14] <DavidSullivan> scott_gonzalez, it appears that someone has allready made a fix to this http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5454
[11:06:28] <DavidSullivan> scott_gonzalez, but I dont see any pull request associated to it
[11:06:37] <gnarf> rxaviers: a second request for the same image hits, the callback never gets called yeah?
[11:08:10] <rxaviers> gnarf, on my code, if we have two requests almost simultaneously. Let's suppose the first generates the image, start to write the temp file and return the buffer to the callback. The 2nd request will also generate the image, will skip the write, and will return the bffer to the callback
[11:08:11] <rxaviers> both works
[11:08:18] <rxaviers> both requests
[11:08:21] <gnarf> ahh yeah
[11:08:29] <gnarf> mine actually skips the second generate ;)
[11:09:24] <rxaviers> :)
[11:11:24] <rxaviers> gnarf, well I will push my change then. ok? see any issue?
[11:11:58] <gnarf> you don't want mine? :)
[11:12:10] <gnarf> it shouldn't make a big diff
[11:12:45] <gnarf> mine actually dealt with the read race using the same generator logic too
[11:13:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: opinion?
[11:14:08] <rxaviers> hehe I liked yours, but I think it overkills it, with all resp
[11:14:56] <rxaviers> we need a third vote :D
[11:15:21] <gnarf> maybe scott_gonzalez will look when he looks here instead of skype? :)
[11:15:49] <rxaviers> :)
[11:54:51] <rxaviers> brb
[11:58:01] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers gnarf: The gist from gnarf with the callback queue is closer to the ideal.
[11:58:24] <scott_gonzalez> DavidSullivan: Which fix are you referring to?
[11:59:08] <gnarf> pushin it

[12:01:01] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: Adding some race-condition protection to the cacheFile read/write
[12:14:29] <DavidSullivan> scott_gonzalez, the fix listed in the description has allready been applied
[12:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> But that doesn't make it fast.
[12:46:37] <DavidSullivan> scott_gonzalez, made it a lot faster
[13:18:32] <DavidSullivan> scott_gonzalez, actualy after doing soem testing doing label[for=
[13:19:15] <DavidSullivan> is not any faster than just doing the [for=" + element.id 
[13:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> What about just using "label" then .filter()
[13:31:48] <DavidSullivan> scott_gonzalez, that is faster. 
[13:31:58] <DavidSullivan> that is what I was suggesting yesterday
[13:32:20] <DavidSullivan> http://jsbin.com/ezorib/3/edit
[13:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> I guess submit a PR for that change and we'll close as fixed, unless you have other ideas for improving it further.
[13:36:56] <DavidSullivan> will look at it again tonight
[13:37:19] <DavidSullivan> scott_gonzalez, the only other thing I could think of is letting them set the selector with a new option
[13:37:33] <scott_gonzalez> No new options.
[13:37:45] <DavidSullivan> scott_gonzalez, wasn't wild about the idea
[13:38:30] <DavidSullivan> scott_gonzalez, I usualy follow a naming convention for the labels   id="labelInputName"
[13:39:30] <DavidSullivan> gotta go to work in a few
[13:50:25] <DavidSullivan> will land the pr after work 1 or 2 in the morn
