[04:56:15] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[05:00:50] <uGoMobi> frequent: pong
[05:02:19] <frequent> uGoMobi: good afternoon
[05:02:45] <frequent> uGoMobi: do you know out of the box if it is possible to pass any parameters from a popup-trigger button to popupbeforeposition?
[05:03:11] <frequent> like when I use a global popup and want to switch it's content depending on from where it is triggered.
[05:03:21] <frequent> (cutting down on number of popups)
[05:05:32] <arschmitz_> frequent: there is nothing to do that out of the box
[05:05:48] <arschmitz_> frequent: you would have to create a click tracker 
[05:05:48] <frequent> arschmitz: ok. thx
[05:06:13] <frequent> arschmitz: I did and it works, but 
[05:06:40] <frequent> I also need to reposition the popup once the content is appended and I was hoping that by running on beforeposition that would not be necessary.
[05:07:37] <frequent> arschmitz: anyway. thx for chipping in
[05:07:51] <arschmitz_> frequent: right in your click handler you just have a shared varible that you set to the clicked link
[05:08:05] <arschmitz_> frequent: then you check that varible in popupbeforeposition
[05:08:13] <uGoMobi> frequent: I guess you don't need me anymore :)
[05:08:31] <frequent> uGoMobi: always good to have you in the background ;-)
[05:08:35] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:08:37] <frequent> arschmitz: good idea.
[05:18:50] <_|Nix|_> Why isn't a popupbeforeposition handler sufficient?
[05:19:26] <_|Nix|_> At popupbeforeposition, you already know that someone clicked the link, and it is the exact right time to change size and positioning.
[05:19:37] <_|Nix|_> popupbeforeposition has event data which can be modified.
[05:19:49] <_|Nix|_> You can alter x, y, and positionTo parameters and they will be honoured.
[05:19:53] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ^
[05:20:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right he just needed to know what link opened it there
[05:20:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Dang nab it! I knew I should've passed in the link.
[05:20:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats why i told him to just set up a click handler and save it to a varible and then use the varible in popupbeforeposition
[05:21:11] <frequent> arschmitz: doing it now (I added the content to the popup on click before)
[05:21:48] <frequent> _|Nix|_: thx for the tip on altering the positioning. Will try that as well.
[05:24:17] <_|Nix|_> frequent: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/examples/popups/alignment.php - Look at the top of the JS portion of the "View Source" popup.
[05:25:28] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I actually overwrite the $.mobile.popup.handleLink function instead of adding another click handler, because $.mobile.popup.handleLink receives the link as a parameter.
[05:25:28] <frequent> _|Nix|_: nice demo
[05:25:33] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Thanks.
[05:26:15] <_|Nix|_> frequent: The click handler is actually not the best place to store the link for future retrieval, because the central click handler does a bunch of processing to handle all kinds of link corner cases.
[05:26:59] <_|Nix|_> frequent: OTOH, the one and only parameter to $.mobile.popup.handleLink is $link, which is the result of the processing done by the central link handler. So, theoretically, $link should be more robust.
[05:27:21] <_|Nix|_> I mean the central click handler, not the central link handler - sorry!
[05:27:34] <frequent> _|Nix|_: :-)

[05:38:12] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06fix-6478 1457fa6b9 15Gabriel Schulhof: Page: Consult $.mobile.keepNative during the execution of keepNativeSelector() to ensure that modifications made during mobileinit are taken into consideration. Fixes #6478.
[05:38:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Could you please look over ^?
[05:38:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... when you get a chance?
[05:39:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I changed the way keepNativeSelector() works to make sure it uses the value of $.mobile.keepNative in addition to all the deprecated places.
[05:41:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Basically: 1. If $.mobile.keepNative is different from the "factory default", add it to the return value of keepNativeSelector(). 2. Same thing for $.mobile.page.prototype.options.keepNativeDefault. 3. If neither is different, add $.mobile.page.prototype.keepNativeDefault. 4. If $.mobile.page.prototype.options.keepNative is set, add that to the return value.
[06:27:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[06:29:28] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I second that ping
[06:29:59] <arschmitz> frequent: hey get your own ping i'm not sharing! :)
[06:30:16] <frequent> _|Nix|_: my-own-ping :-)
[06:32:36] <_|Nix|_> What's up, gentlemen?
[06:32:50] <frequent> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: please
[06:32:57] <arschmitz> lol
[06:33:05] <frequent> don't want to cut in line... ;-)
[06:33:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think we can do keepnative a little easier
[06:33:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[06:33:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just set $.mobile.keepNative = $.mobile.page.prototype
[06:33:37] <arschmitz> then check in keepnativeselector if they are still equal
[06:33:50] <arschmitz> if they are not use $.mobile.keepnative
[06:34:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: My concern is the case where legacy code coexists with updated code. One modifies $.mobile.keepNative, whereas the other modifies $.mobile.page.prototype.options.keepNativeDefault.
[06:34:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont think we should support using both at the same time
[06:34:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it adds a lot of complexity
[06:35:10] <arschmitz> that will just be removed after 1.4 anyway
[06:35:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and duplications in the resulting selector string.
[06:35:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, supporting both the old way and the new way is the essence of deprecation.
[06:36:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well we support both
[06:36:10] <arschmitz> just not at the same time
[06:36:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I need to check the API docs for what we say about keepNativeDefault.
[06:36:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is it supposed to be modified, like, ever, given that we have keepNative?
[06:37:09] <arschmitz> i checked this at some point but i dont recall how its documented
[06:37:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The option keepNative is not documented at all!
[06:38:08] <arschmitz> go figure 
[06:38:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, keepNativeDefault is the only option ...
[06:38:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then where'd we get keepNative? It's not listed under options: { ... } in page.js either.
[06:38:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That would also reduce the complexity.
[06:39:24] <arschmitz> yeah im not entirely sure when i started redoing the page stuff it was like that and to make current tests pass
[06:39:55] <arschmitz> thats why i just decided starting in 1.5 to just use a selector on $.mobile
[06:39:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, there was a test where the value of keepNativeDefault was being assigned to keepNative, but I believe that test is invalid.
[06:40:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you assign a value to keepNative, why would you ever assign the same value as keepNativeDefault?
[06:40:24] <arschmitz> no idea
[06:40:35] <arschmitz> ok so we know how this should be
[06:40:45] <arschmitz> just check $.mobile.keepnative
[06:40:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think since keepNative is not documented at all, I think we should just get rid of it.
[06:40:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's not even declared in options:
[06:41:03] <arschmitz> and how its documented is on prototype
[06:41:18] <arschmitz> so i agree remove from options
[06:41:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[06:41:41] <arschmitz> now we just deal with the prototype version and the $.mobile version
[06:42:26] <arschmitz> $.mobile should take presedance over prototype since thats the new way and if your doing it it means you have upgraded 
[06:42:49] <arschmitz> and we should not support different values in two different places its a single value
[06:43:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what do you think?
[06:43:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. So you can't mix old and new. Roger that! I'll change that branch to remove the option and to remove the tracking for both old and new.
[06:43:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I agree 100%.
[06:43:58] <arschmitz> awesome
[06:44:53] <_|Nix|_> frequent: You're up.
[06:46:00] <frequent> _|Nix|_: thx
[06:46:10] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I did not read up if you still found something on #6483 (panel outside page does not work on 2nd page), but placing the header that opens the panel outside of the page ... understandibly fixes the blanking on my side.
[06:46:56] <frequent> _|Nix|_: nicely done global toolbars btw. :-)
[06:47:09] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Thank arschmitz, not me.
[06:47:09] <frequent> arschmitz: ^
[06:47:29] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I haven't really worked with panel/toolbar much.
[06:47:36] <frequent> ok
[06:48:51] <frequent> _|Nix|_: but panels working with a link on a global header supports what you or arschmitz: said yesterday of buttons not being in the DOM during initialization not properly being "jqm-izzled"
[06:51:37] <arschmitz> frequent: i have that fixed
[06:51:42] <arschmitz> just have not pushed it yet
[06:52:02] <frequent> arschmitz: cool. I will wait for the push. No hurry

[15:46:30] <gseguin> agcolom: nope
[15:46:51] <agcolom> oh good :-)
[15:47:14] <agcolom> Will continue to look through the test and search for typos :-) maybe tomorrow :-)
[15:53:02] <agcolom> I'm confused.... How come build was ok, and the 2 following ones are broken when I've just fixed typos? Is it because there was a change to core in the meantime?
[15:53:14] <agcolom> build 805 ^
[15:53:32] <agcolom> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds
[16:00:50] <gseguin> agcolom: tests are still unstable it seems
[16:01:16] <agcolom> is it me?
[16:01:23] <gseguin> agcolom: if all you're touching is the test name it's not you
[16:02:14] <agcolom> All I've changed is the string inside test
[16:02:29] <agcolom> so https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/694082349bd42e3f73cfd7e26b58a728f75027d9
