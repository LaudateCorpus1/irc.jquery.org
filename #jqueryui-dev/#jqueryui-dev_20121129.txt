[06:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I have no idea what's causing the button failure, but I've at least got it passing now.
[06:12:15] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: HOW?
[06:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> setTimeout() on the simulated click.
[06:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that fixes Opera.
[06:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't fix IE.
[06:12:54] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI 1-9-stable - 1.7.x core build #14: STILL FAILING in 40 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%201.7.x%20core/14/
[06:13:38] <scott_gonzalez> But IE is a consistent failure, not like Opera.
[06:13:45] <scott_gonzalez> I think they're different issues.
[06:14:00] <mikesherov> so, IE is definitely a different issue
[06:14:16] <mikesherov> I am ignoring it on oldIE
[06:14:26] <mikesherov> which is why I asked about jquery.simulate.js
[06:14:43] <mikesherov> see http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui2/ticket/2528826 fore more info
[06:14:46] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[06:14:57] <mikesherov> I want jquery.simulate.js to pave over that behavior
[06:15:13] <mikesherov> or at least mention the errata
[06:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> Re-testing now that I've merged with your change.
[06:16:51] <scott_gonzalez> I really wish I got commit notifications in my inbox.
[06:17:58] <scott_gonzalez> I've been having trouble getting Opera to load in BrowserStack.
[06:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> I've gotten a lot of VMs that launch with the browser open but not tabs and I can't interact with it.
[06:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm going to commit this.
[06:19:26] <mikesherov> k
[06:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, did your change fix Opera too?
[06:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> I just noticed the ).simulate("mousedown").simulate("click").simulate("mouseup")
[06:20:04] <mikesherov> no, it didn't
[06:20:07] <mikesherov> you can remove those
[06:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:20:24] <mikesherov> I THOUGHT it worked because of the reordered tests passing
[06:20:36] <mikesherov> I saw one pass and thought my changed fixed that
[06:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:20:56] <mikesherov> although, a simulated click SHOULD do mousedown, click, mouseup

[06:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:21:16] <mikesherov> it doesn't yet, and I'll be modifying simulate to do so
[06:22:28] <kborchers> mikesherov: i would really appreciate that since that is why i struggled with that dialog test ‚Ä¶ i kept simulating click and it wouldn't reproduce the error because it was happening on mousedown :/
[06:22:44] <mikesherov> kborchers: yeah
[06:22:49] <mikesherov> it's on my plate
[06:22:56] <mikesherov> right now, I'm wrestling with mergeatron
[06:23:16] <mikesherov> kborchers: actually, can you file an issue here: http://github.com/jquery/jquery-simulate
[06:23:29] <kborchers> yup
[06:23:46] <mikesherov> just collecting issues for right now, eventually, the code will actually go there :-)
[06:24:21] <kborchers> mikesherov: hah, ok. i was confused for a second :)
[06:25:34] <kborchers> mikesherov: scott_gonzalez is it mousedown, click, mouseup or mousedown, mouseup, click ?
[06:25:34] <mikesherov> :-)
[06:26:07] <mikesherov> kborchers: I don't recall. I'll just use firebug + monitorEvents() to figure it out :-)
[06:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> down, up, click
[06:26:24] <kborchers> ok, that's what i thought
[06:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> And down and up have to occur on the same element for click to occur, but of course that would always be the case in simulate.
[06:27:37] <kborchers> right
[06:30:02] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: in your response on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/850 you said "We only accept bug fixes for combobox." did you mean autocomplete?
[06:34:04] <scott_gonzalez> No, I meant we don't accept feature/API changes for combobox.
[06:34:20] <scott_gonzalez> But we do accept bug fixes.
[06:34:34] <kborchers> oh i see. sorry, still waking up :)
[06:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[06:39:41] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi Scott, Something weird on ui docs...
[06:39:57] <agcolom> button demos are accordions!
[06:40:17] <agcolom> http://jqueryui.com/button/
[06:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[06:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> The view source is correct. This is certainly strange.
[06:42:18] <agcolom> yes, I checked that too ;-) really strange ;-)
[06:42:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's not even the default accordion demo.
[06:43:14] <agcolom> is it not? all the other button demos are fine... it's just the default one...
[06:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> It's the collapsible content accordion demo.
[06:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea how that could've happened.
[06:44:56] <scott_gonzalez> I just redeployed and it's fixed.
[06:45:08] <scott_gonzalez> Let's hope some other random demo didn't just get swapped :-P
[06:45:11] <agcolom> ok, let me reload...
[06:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers jzaefferer: Any objection to removing the animated progressbar demo?
[06:46:26] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI 1-9-stable - 1.8.x core build #14: STILL FAILING in 33 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%201.8.x%20core/14/
[06:46:51] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not from me ‚Ä¶ though, i wonder if it's worth the time to make the indeterminate overlay work with determinate progressbars for a new version of "animated progressbar"
[06:47:10] <agcolom> I guess I need to wait to see the button default...  
[06:47:19] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It's live.
[06:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: animated progressbars are just CSS.
[06:47:33] <scott_gonzalez> That was the point of the demo.
[06:48:12] <kborchers> oh, right. i say remove it
[06:48:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just now getting around to reviewing the final progressbar changes.
[06:49:04] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: yep, had to launch a new browser... (cache)

In the UI version of theme roller, can you do something similar so that you could have two different looking buttons on the same page?

[08:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Thoughts on only generating the overlay div when it's actually used?
[08:53:17] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmmm, but as they turn indeterminate on and off (not sure why but they could), would it need to be generated and destroyed every time?
[08:53:34] <kborchers> i guess it is now anyway
[08:53:41] <kborchers> that's probably fine
[08:54:02] <kborchers> wait no ‚Ä¶ it's not
[09:00:13] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's be destroyed/created as needed.
[09:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> If the state changes, it's generally going to be indeterminate -> determinate 1 time
[09:01:58] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yes, unless a single progressbar is being used to monitor the progress of multiple things loading in sequence ‚Ä¶ just trying to find a real world example of indeterminate -> determinate -> indeterminate -> ...
[09:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> Even still, creating and destroying a single element is fast.

[09:23:34] <jzaefferer> gnarf: since clip animations aren't the holy grail, anything we can do here? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4421
[09:31:08] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, all, guys when binding click and instead of the default action, we change location.href (like here https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/app/resources/themeroller.js#L239), it does NOT work for middle-click or open in a new tab/window click, right? What's the best way to fix this?
[09:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> Use real URLs.
[09:33:17] <DaveMethvin> should that escape() call be encodeURIComponent instead?
[09:33:34] * DaveMethvin immediately takes question off course
[09:34:53] <scott_gonzalez> If we're using an anchor, we should be dynamically updating the href instead of using location.href inside the click.
[09:35:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that woudl fix it right
[09:36:12] <DaveMethvin> on bubbling click events i think it catches right and middle click as well, but patching the href in advance would be the cleanest solution
[09:38:18] <scott_gonzalez> I updated the new ticket page to have a section about reporting web site bugs: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/newticket
[09:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> Now the big red box is BIG :-)

[09:54:46] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, DaveMethvin, yeap, I was afraid of that. Thanks. So, I will stick with changing the a.href prior the click then.

[10:51:07] <kborchers> lol
[10:52:40] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so did they have a mac installer or were they like, "oh well, you don't really need it"?
[10:53:10] <scott_gonzalez> They went out and got their own Windows laptop.
[10:53:26] <kborchers> hah, nice
[10:53:32] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently they have to do something to keep it active or it'll shut off after some time period.
[10:54:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so basically they're all telling you that you need to constantly torrent tv shows and movies to keep your internet from shutting off ‚Ä¶ cool
[10:55:50] <kborchers> i need to just go back to the days of "borrowing" my neighbors' internet :)

[13:36:58] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I meant the examples at the bottom, which are not in a box.
[13:37:24] <scott_gonzalez> And only widgets use those boxes; methods, properties, and selectors don't
[13:38:05] <agcolom> yes, I agree with you that wouldn't work for methods and the ones you've listed...
[13:39:11] <agcolom> Still thinking...
[13:40:29] <agcolom> but then those pages also do not have the quick nav...
[13:41:09] <agcolom> we definitely need a link form the top to the quick-nav section
[13:41:20] <agcolom> from ^
[13:42:30] <agcolom> The examples not in a box doesn't look to strange to me as they sort of close the outer box...
[13:42:46] <jzaefferer> petersendidit: since there's hardly new tickets to triage (and we're not yet looking at your PR), think you could help out with some API docs? We'd like to resolve these before 1.10: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues?state=open (some are actually done already, just need to land in master)
[13:43:32] <petersendidit> Sure might have some time tomorrow.
[14:02:22] <jzaefferer> petersendidit: cool, thanks. Let me (or scott_gonzalez, as usual) know when you have any questions. 
[14:11:58] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: just spotted something in api docs... take for example http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[14:14:21] <agcolom> the code examples in the method section go to the edge of the outer box, while the code examples in the option and event sections don't
[14:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Can you file a bug for that?
[14:26:56] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15blesh opened pull request #853: Support for <base /> tag. (06master...06master)  02http://git.io/-22SGQ
[14:29:21] <kborchers> BASE LOLOLOLOL
[14:38:10] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: sure... where would that go though? api.jqueryui.com? 
[14:38:56] <agcolom> (also the case for mobile as we have similar styles ;-) )
[14:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You can file against api.jqueryui.com or web-base-template.
[14:54:39] <scott_gonzalez> That feels like a super troll, with the XML encoding :-/
[14:57:44] <agcolom> issue opened :-)
[15:00:50] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: the super troll, what was that referring to? (the new issue or the Description box?) (or maybe something else ;-)
[15:02:00] <scott_gonzalez> It was about the <base /> tag pull request.
[15:02:20] <agcolom> oh sorry ;-)
[15:02:44] <agcolom> (I thought it was something to do with me ;-) )

[18:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> heh, I haven't looked yet.
