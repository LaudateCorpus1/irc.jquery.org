[02:42:08] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper, are you around?
[02:42:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Hi Anne
[02:42:27] <agcolom> I've started to look at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/compare/master...1-4
[02:42:47] <agcolom> but it's really not that easy for me as I don't always know what is new in 1.4
[02:43:03] <uGoMobi> ah I see
[02:43:09] <agcolom> so not sure sometimes whether things should go into 1.3 also...
[02:44:45] <agcolom> for example: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/72f49d53b75823a85d31f755d31b78f0bdb767e3#diff-c8698e44ba43d8df73306ee3281c9709L180
[02:45:37] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.6.x core build #492: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.6.x%20core/492/
[02:46:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: can you check just your own commits
[02:46:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: and take care of the obvious ones
[02:46:22] <agcolom> yes, I think that'd be better. Thanks :-)
[02:46:57] <uGoMobi> agcolom: commits like this https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/895b6aa744525178c19fe58193975954c0f4fd1f
[02:47:35] <agcolom> yes, that one should go into 1.3, right? 
[02:48:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, that doesn't seem 1.4 specific
[02:48:45] <agcolom> ok, do I create a list somewhere? 
[02:49:22] <agcolom> e.g. a google docs?
[02:53:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am wondering if you can just cherry-pick the commit from 1-4 into master or if that will cause trouble
[02:53:29] <uGoMobi> agcolom: have to ask scott_gonzalez 
[02:54:04] <agcolom> I've started a google doc... I shared with you, _|Nix|_ and arschmitz
[02:54:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok
[03:15:40] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.7.x core build #491: STILL UNSTABLE in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.7.x%20core/491/
[03:30:50] <agcolom> uGoMobi: All mine are in, but they are all about minor formatting issues in the xml... so usually removing trailing spaces, adding spaces or tabs, or changing examples from xhtml to html. Some were also to change the height of the examples iframes, but again, all these are specific to 1-4 as the height in 1.3 is slightly different
[03:31:11] <agcolom> so none of these if you like are "essential" for 1.3
[03:32:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok thanks!
[03:32:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I was looking into iframe styles the other day
[03:32:35] <agcolom> when I was doing them, I was thinking of doing similar ones in 1.3 later (most of the heights are ok in 1.3, and the formatting won't show to the user viewing the docs. 
[03:32:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I might have a solution so we can get rid of all those inline styles
[03:32:55] <agcolom> likewise, I thought we could live with xhtml examples in 1.3
[03:33:35] <agcolom> if there are any pb incorporating my 1.4 chages into 1.3, I can do them manually after we release 1.4
[03:33:51] <agcolom> as they are all "no big deal"
[03:34:02] <uGoMobi> ok
[03:34:06] <agcolom> what is your solution for the iframes?
[03:35:01] <uGoMobi> I wrapped them in a div and added a rule to the stylesheet which makes sure the iframes get the correct height
[03:35:23] <uGoMobi> only problem was that it looked like they were zoomed out a bit on firefox
[03:35:56] <agcolom> oh, that would be nice, although I've become quite good at "guessing" the height in pixels ;-)
[03:36:23] <uGoMobi> haha
[03:36:54] <agcolom> ;-)
[03:36:56] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I will let you know when I've got it working on all browsers
[03:37:06] <agcolom> brilliant, yes :-)
[03:37:30] <uGoMobi> I looked into it to fix this double scrollbars issue
[03:37:43] <uGoMobi> but would be nice if we don't need the inline styles anymore
[03:37:55] <agcolom> yes, absolutely!
[03:45:40] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #467: STILL UNSTABLE in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/467/
[05:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom uGoMobi: You can cherry-pick commits from 1-4 to master, but do NOT use -x. The 1-4 commits with either disappear or their SHA will change.
[05:13:01] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ok thanks
[06:09:39] <DaveMethvin> should the mobile file be updating $.ui.version? it sets the value to @VERSION
[06:10:38] <DaveMethvin> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.0-rc.1/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-rc.1.js
[06:10:58] <kborchers> o_O
[06:11:02] <DaveMethvin> uGoMobi scott_gonzalez
[06:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> That's really bad.
[06:11:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing they pulled from a random SHA.
[06:12:35] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: What version did you put in mobile?
[06:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/812ce9df58b007ba63d26f14b3424ae3cd5f503c
[06:13:31] <DaveMethvin> but will the mobile file ever be setting $.ui.version in the future? it just seems a bit strange
[06:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> They shouldn't.
[06:14:09] <DaveMethvin> ok good .. there's a $.mobile.version so i expected that
[06:20:23] <tj_vantoll> Anybody have opinions here? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9689
[06:20:23] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: You have 2 new messages, use `read when you wish to read them.
[06:20:30] <tj_vantoll> `read
[06:20:30] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: From scott_gonzalez, 1d 1h ago: I rebased 1-11 again (docs)
[06:20:35] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: From scott_gonzalez, 1d 1h ago: I don't think this will conflict again, but just in case, I modified this old commit to be protocol-relative: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commit/0a283b7fbbe6cfccbbeda457f405ddc4bde7d109#diff-483dec7c10920f8232fe38109fd35ea4R122
[06:27:23] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I agree with your comments. I'm gonna to expand on that with another comment and close as notabug.
[06:27:54] <tj_vantoll> Ok thanks.
[06:29:12] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: One more http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9688
[06:29:57] <tj_vantoll> I'm thinking notabug here as well. But for the rewrite I'm wondering whether changing the min and max *should* update the <input>'s value.
[06:30:06] <tj_vantoll> The native picker does not - http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/mDX67/
[06:31:01] <tj_vantoll> And I believe that's the route we took for spinner (don't change the user provided value but do add an isValid() method).
[06:31:03] <scott_gonzalez> Spinner changes the value.
[06:32:00] <tj_vantoll> Huh you're right.
[06:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't look like it triggers change either.
[06:33:45] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't mean this behavior is correct though.
[06:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to write down the behavior of spinner, slider, and datepicker.
[06:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> But for UI and native.
[06:34:41] <scott_gonzalez> Does the value change? If so, does it trigger change?
[06:34:52] <scott_gonzalez> I doubt you'd get a native change even if the native value changes.
[06:34:57] <tj_vantoll> Sure. Fun times :)

[12:04:23] <gseguin> arschmitz: how do we send the files to MS for the CDN?
[12:05:12] <arschmitz> its a form
[12:05:39] <arschmitz> you fill it out with project and release info and upload the file with it
[12:06:01] <arschmitz> gseguin: ^^
[12:06:22] <arschmitz> gseguin: so it cant really be automated
[12:06:27] <uGoMobi> :(
[12:06:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i guess you could post to the form if we wanted to get all complicated about it lol
[12:07:43] <gseguin> arschmitz: ah bummer!
[12:08:29] <uGoMobi> gseguin: what you could do is make the script send an email to remind us that we need to upload it on the MS CDN :)
[12:08:47] <uGoMobi> hmm we don't have a generic email address
[12:09:10] <gseguin> That's fine we can hardcode the email adresses
[12:09:20] <gseguin> it's not like it changes often
[12:09:43] <uGoMobi> don't think we should use personal email addresses anywhere in the code
[12:09:57] <uGoMobi> is mobile@jquery.org available? :)
[12:10:23] <gseguin> true
[12:10:39] <gseguin> That would be a question for gnarf maybe?
[12:12:21] <uGoMobi> ok I'll ask
[12:13:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is that problem with setting UI version in Mobile solved?
[12:14:03] <uGoMobi> I was disconnected couple times so I might have missed something
[12:14:11] <gnarf> gseguin: what is the address for?
[12:14:36] <gseguin> sort of an alias for the mobile team
[12:14:41] <gseguin> right uGoMobi ?
[12:14:50] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:15:13] <uGoMobi> couple of team members should have access
[12:15:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[12:16:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: couldnt we just set up a google group
[12:16:06] <arschmitz> and have it email the group
[12:16:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's a good idea
[12:17:02] <gnarf> gseguin: uGoMobi: e-mails to add?
[12:17:10] <gnarf> mobile-team@jquery.com
[12:18:24] <uGoMobi> gnarf: you mean to which email addresses it should forward?
[12:18:29] <gnarf> yes
[12:18:34] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:18:47] <uGoMobi> jasper at ugomobi dot com
[12:19:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz gseguin ^^
[12:19:13] <uGoMobi> want to add your email addresses?
[12:19:26] <arschmitz> gnarf: pretty sure you know mine
[12:19:36] <gseguin> ghislain+jquery at gmail dot com
[12:20:13] <uGoMobi> thanks gnarf 
[12:21:06] <gnarf> gseguin: it's google group so they wouldn't let me add you as +jquery
[12:21:26] <gnarf> got gseguin and arschmitz - uGoMobi yours?
[12:21:34] <gseguin> without the +jquery that's fine
