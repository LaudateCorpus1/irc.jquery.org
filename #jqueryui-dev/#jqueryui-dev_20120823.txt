[04:37:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmm, that looks like something changed in FF :/
[04:37:37] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check an old version.
[04:37:38] <kborchers> i fixed that a while ago so that the menu item wouldn't be selected if the mouse happened to be there when it appeared but it does again in ff now
[04:38:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not getting immediate selection from the mouse.
[04:39:01] <scott_gonzalez> Firefox 14.0.1
[04:39:23] <scott_gonzalez> This PR is about something else.
[04:39:39] <scott_gonzalez> If you move the mouse over the menu, the items are selected, but the text field doesn't update.
[04:39:47] <scott_gonzalez> However, if you press tab, the text field changes.
[04:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, item is *focused* with mouse, not selected.
[04:40:04] <scott_gonzalez> tab = select the focused item
[04:40:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: really, i have the same version and correct, it doesn't select the item but it focuses it and then tab selects it because it's focused. i thought i had made it so that until a mouse move happened, it would not be focused so that the selection would occur
[04:41:06] <kborchers> s/would/wouldn't
[04:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not seeing the behavior you're describing.
[04:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> Let's screenshare.

[04:43:31] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[04:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> As far as I'm concerned, it's working properly :-P

[05:00:59] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I bounced both of those autocomplete BB tickets back to the reporter. It's working fine for me using 1.8.16 and master.
[05:01:37] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so impatient :P … i have time to work tonight so was planning on looking at those but ok :)
[05:03:10] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I had a feeling they were bogus and I wanted to get through everything for the RC :-)
[05:04:13] <scott_gonzalez> This just leaves autocomplete tab behavior which came up this morning.
[05:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> If we're going to change it, I'd like to do it before the RC.
[05:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'll wait till jzaefferer is around though.
[05:05:14] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: oi
[05:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, and the datepicker i18n
[05:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/717
[05:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> Awesome Bar always treats TAB as DOWN when the menu is open.
[05:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome's location bar does what the PR does (nothing)
[05:06:37] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: we aren't strictly following awesome bar design anymore, are we?
[05:06:56] <scott_gonzalez> we are
[05:07:04] <jzaefferer> removing tab is one thing, this goes even further: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9624773/jquery-autocomplete-mouse-below-text-box-a-causes-selection-after-menu-is-show
[05:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not aware of anywhere that we deviate.
[05:07:49] <jzaefferer> okay
[05:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers fixed that (though he thinks the bug has returned, but I can't reproduce).
[05:09:39] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7024
[05:10:02] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/098dd1404b7b6025a5735495a91ca2b964c5cb3e

[05:10:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: damn it … still too early. no i wasn't
[05:10:58] <kborchers> idiot
[05:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[05:11:14] <kborchers> that is where it is fixed
[05:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> bah, I think it's too early in Mozilla-world for people to be responding on IRC.
[05:16:57] <scott_gonzalez> Stupid westcoasters.
[07:17:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-) Finally figured out a good way to build the TOC for the upgrade guide.

[10:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Do you have time today to look at the /category/All implementation?
[11:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> FML
[11:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> All this time digging through bugzilla and asking Firefox devs about why TAB behaves like DOWN in the Awesome Bar.
[11:25:28] <scott_gonzalez> Just to realize that autocomplete in a normal form field in Firefox and Chrome behaves exactly like our widget when pressing tab.
[11:50:49] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I have confirmation that the method/property/selector pages shouldn't be changing for the API sites.
[11:51:25] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, cool. i should be able to work on those tonight
[11:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[11:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want me to tackle the i18n files?
[11:51:57] <scott_gonzalez> Or are you going to do that tonight?
[12:01:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: sorry was afk. i can take a look tonight. those shouldn't be bad right? just some find and replace … basically?
[12:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> Not too many instances either.
[12:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> You only need to do the ones that are parts of dates.
[12:03:54] <scott_gonzalez> There are a lot of entities in things like prev/nextMonth, but those don't need to be changed.
[12:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> Since they never end up in a text field.
[12:04:16] <kborchers> right. ok, i'll just knock those out quick first and then look at the api sites
[13:40:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: pong
[13:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Thoughts on that color PR?

[14:16:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems like I could probably stealthily fix that in 2.0.0
[14:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> 2.0.0?
[14:16:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: like - repackage right now since noone knows about 2.0 yet
[14:16:38] <scott_gonzalez> umm...
[14:16:38] <gnarf> or just tag 2.0.1
[14:16:43] <gnarf> and move on
[14:16:50] <gnarf> cuz thats a pretty big problem
[14:16:55] <gnarf> dunno how that got left in there
[14:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[14:17:12] <gnarf> I think the unit test needs to jQuery.noConflict() just to make sure that doesn't happen again
[14:17:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the $
[14:17:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you talking about the $ ?
[14:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm talking about fill.
[14:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/pull/42
[14:18:09] <scott_gonzalez> But yes, you should tag 2.0.1, probably after dealing with this new PR.
[14:19:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: commented on PR
[14:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> me too :-P
[14:19:37] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery.Color.hook()
[14:19:44] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's css + step.
[14:19:46] <gnarf> okay
[14:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> Seems better than supporting all SVG props.
[14:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> And supporting arbitrary SVG props just seems odd.
[14:25:27] <gnarf> seems like a smart play
[14:25:56] <gnarf> I kinda wish our .each() wasn't backwards
[14:26:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html search for "color and painting"
[14:26:20] <gnarf> yeah, too many to be sane
[14:26:22] <scott_gonzalez> I assume it's some small subset of that.
[14:26:32] <gnarf> if it was like 5 - I would think it might make sense
[14:26:35] <scott_gonzalez> That contains things like opacity, width, rendering, etc.
[14:26:39] <scott_gonzalez> It might be 5.
[14:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> found it
[14:27:06] <scott_gonzalez>  ‘fill’, ‘stroke’, ‘stop-color’, ‘flood-color’ and ‘lighting-color’
[14:27:14] <scott_gonzalez> heh, exactly 5
[14:28:22] <gnarf> i mean, we add like maybe 40 bytes to pull that off by default
[14:29:16] <gnarf> we'll prolly add 20 to make the hook visible
[14:30:14] <gnarf> so - this is the question that we probably can't answer
[14:30:32] <gnarf> but roughly, what % of people would be interested in animating SVG color properties
[14:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> unsure, but SVG is on the wontfix list: http://docs.jquery.com/Won%27t_Fix#SVG.2FXML.2FVML_Bugs
[14:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'd say just expose it, document it, maybe even show how to add the SVG props in the readme?
[14:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe not the last part, but it wouldn't hurt to mention SVG in the docs for .hook().
[14:33:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems like a plan, I'll start implementing
[14:33:32] <scott_gonzalez> \o/
[14:35:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: .hook( "fill stroke" )
[14:35:30] <gnarf> ?
[14:35:47] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, it's not gonna add bytes anyway, right?
[14:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> You'd be doing the split either way.
[14:37:18] <gnarf> yeah, i'm removing the split from the hooks string and adding it to the .hook()
[14:43:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: looks like adding .hook() is +14 total
[14:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> nice
[14:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> totally worth it
[14:43:51] <gnarf> that should be 2.1.0 right?
[14:43:59] <gnarf> new api call?
[14:44:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so - how can i setup my unit suite to yell at me if i keep a $
[14:44:51] <scott_gonzalez> Call jQuery.noConflict() before any tests run.
[14:45:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that won't grab things that use $ in the global tho
[14:45:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'll kill window.$.
[14:46:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I mean, in like the "starting" context of color
[14:46:15] <gnarf> $ still will exis
[14:46:18] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/1k0n1j3e3B0o
[14:46:20] <gnarf> i did that
[14:46:27] <gnarf> and even then, it still didn't bitch when I used $
[14:46:37] <gnarf> actually
[14:46:41] <gnarf> shouldn't lint be bitching?
[14:46:47] <scott_gonzalez> don't assign
[14:46:54] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm not sure why assigning would change anything.
[14:50:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I just took out the "jQuery" option in jshintrc
[14:50:38] <gnarf> and replaced it with "globals": { "jQuery": true }
[14:50:46] <gnarf> and now jshint complains about any use of $
[14:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[14:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like the code should've failed though.
[14:51:34] <scott_gonzalez> With the noConflict() call.
[15:03:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: agree, but it didn't
[15:03:49] <gnarf> i'm not sure why
[15:05:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/commit/77a68da41381634a507ca102efeac097a3d6f504
[15:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[15:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> So now would be a good time to tag 2.0.1.
[15:08:40] <gnarf> 2.1.0 ?
[15:08:45] <gnarf> added a new api function
[15:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[15:09:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm gonna wait until I can actually do the full release, about to head out the door
[15:10:02] <gnarf> just trying to remember the process
[15:10:31] <gnarf> git co -b release ; edit version in package.json ; grunt manifest ; commit ; tag ; push ; delete branch ?
[15:10:33] <scott_gonzalez> Probably `git checkout -b release` grunt manifest` `grunt`
[15:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> looks right

[17:13:05] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Made hide and show options into includes. - Scott González
[17:13:20] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers jzaefferer kswedberg: New (working) implementation for <placeholder>
[17:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> <placeholder name="foo"> now reads @foo from the <entry>
[17:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> I stole the implementation from the notes logic that I assume kswedberg had originally written.
[17:15:00] <scott_gonzalez> I wish we could do an include and add attributes to the element being included.
[17:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> The way notes worked was really nice.
[17:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> But it couldn't be abstracted.
[17:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> Well, not in as nice a way.
[17:15:52] <scott_gonzalez> The abstraction is what we have now, where the attributes have to live on the entry node.
[17:16:32] <scott_gonzalez> Unless anyone has any other ideas.
[17:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that <placeholder> can appear in a any <desc>, which occurs all over the place in widgets.

[17:47:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: any reason to not replace every one of those entities in the i18n files? would make find and replace a lot easier
[17:48:09] <scott_gonzalez> You can, just seemed like more work.
[17:48:23] <kborchers> not with replace across files in sublime text ;)
[17:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I assume the characters in those other fields aren't going to show up in the fields you're replacing.
[17:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> So it's more characters to convert.
[17:49:21] <scott_gonzalez> Unless Sublime has a magical convert from entities to UTF feature that I don't know about.
[17:51:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not sure what you mean, i just did a search for & in i18n folder, then i go through those results, copy an entity, look it up, then find and replace across those files and redo the search for &
[17:51:37] <kborchers> unless there's something wrong with my method that you can see
[17:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing wrong with that.
[17:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> You'll just end up looking up more characters than necessary.
[17:52:23] <scott_gonzalez> But go ahead, it'll still only take 5 minutes.
[17:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> And in reality, there's no reason for any HTML entities in those files.
[17:52:40] <kborchers> yeah, that's kind of what i figured :)
[17:54:55] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: before i change these, it looks like almost every file uses &#x3c; and &#x3e; for < and > … wonder if there's any reason for that
[17:55:30] <scott_gonzalez> doubtful
[17:55:39] <kborchers> ok
[17:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> actually...
[17:56:15] <scott_gonzalez> This is datepicker, so...
[17:56:26] <kborchers> :)
[17:56:32] <kborchers> BOOM
[17:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's entirely possible it's doing raw string concatenation to generate the HTML.
[17:56:56] <kborchers> woops, looked at datepicker wrong and it exploded
[17:57:13] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[17:57:19] <kborchers> now i'm nervous
[17:57:23] <scott_gonzalez> Scumbag Kris look at datepicker...
[17:57:31] <kborchers> maybe i'll leave those alone
[17:58:44] <scott_gonzalez> good idea
[17:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe you should just do the files I mentioned in the ticket :-P

[18:46:12] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: should i pull that datepicker commit into 1-8-stable as well?
[18:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[18:47:11] <scott_gonzalez> cherry-pick -x
[18:48:01] <kborchers> ok
[18:53:51] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: seems weird that all of the files have conflicts on my changes when i cherry-pick :/
[18:54:48] <kborchers> well, all but 1
[18:57:12] <scott_gonzalez> oh, we probably did tabs or something in master.
[18:57:28] <scott_gonzalez> cherry-picking isn't really important.
[18:57:33] <scott_gonzalez> Especially with 1.9 so close.
[18:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> My general rule is if the cherry-pick causes conflicts, I don't bother.
[18:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> I occassionally make exceptions if I know the conflict is easy to resolve.
[19:01:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, i'll probably just skip it then. visually it just looks like my changes so not sure why there is a conflict so not worth it
[19:01:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[19:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> The important this is that it's in master, so we're good :-)
[19:01:53] <kborchers> yep
[20:31:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: still around?
