[14:05:00] <agcolom> Hi! is anyone around? I got something really strange happening with ui
[14:05:19] <agcolom> gnaf?
[14:10:55] <agcolom> strange, the problem seems to have just disappeared! I was getting a redirect to some weird sites when going to http://jqueryui.com/ui/jquery.ui.core.js
[14:11:46] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/UVkyJw
[14:11:46] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Added <title> for page titles. - Scott González
[14:14:01] <agcolom> no the problem is still here... but with a different file??
[14:25:47] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi, I seem to have got some weird redirect when linking to jqueryui files.
[14:26:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not seeing anything.
[14:27:13] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you linking to jqueryui.com files?
[14:27:36] <agcolom> I was trying to do a demo with a progress bar with popups
[14:27:55] <agcolom> a progress bar in a popup!
[14:28:26] <agcolom> has this problem been reported before? (I was doing that in a jsbin)
[14:29:12] <scott_gonzalez> No, that hasn't been reported before.
[14:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> But you shouldn't be linking to jqueryui.com
[14:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> Use one of the CDNs.
[14:29:58] <agcolom> ok. (i just did a view source on the docs)
[14:30:37] <agcolom> ok, will replace that and see what happens...
[14:41:03] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I've got it. I misspelled the URL and forgot the y! then that gives you some weird sites with a trojan virus!
[14:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[14:43:55] <agcolom> Well, not the best way to find out, but better to know these things I suppose. Is it worth sending a message on basecamp or is this something you were aware already?
[14:44:13] <agcolom> aware of^
[14:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> Wasn't aware, but I don't think there's anything to do about it.
[14:49:16] <agcolom> ok... thanks and sorry! I really thought there was a virus on the jqueryui site!
