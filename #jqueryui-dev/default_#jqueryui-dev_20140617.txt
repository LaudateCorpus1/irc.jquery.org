[04:42:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping
[04:51:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[04:52:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz pointed me at the fact that what we discussed with web-ui-fw team this morning does not really match with what we discussed during last week's team meeting
[04:52:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: regarding collapsible/accordion
[04:53:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What exactly is the discrepancy?
[04:53:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: last week we were talking about not working on collapsible until we decided about when adopting accordion
[04:54:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, but in the meantime, Kangsik had already done the work.
[04:54:03] <arschmitz> and that likely we would do absolutly no work or deprecation
[04:54:19] <arschmitz> so having the samsung guys do anything is a complete waste of their time
[04:54:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this morning we said continue to work on it and decide later about deprecating collapsible and adopt accordion
[04:54:42] <_|Nix|_> Well, it's not too late to reverse direction.
[04:54:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and decided all of a sudden that collapsible would be in 1.6 
[04:55:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: we really need to make sure we are communicating clearly to the samsung people it seems like communication is becoming an issue as we had issues with button too
[04:55:47] <_|Nix|_> Well, the roadmap targets accordion for inclusion in 1.7.
[04:55:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes but last week we discussed that
[04:56:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and decided we should change that
[04:57:06] <_|Nix|_> Well, the two efforts are not necessarily incompatible. If we deprecate collapsible as a whole, that includes deprecating the style options.
[04:57:06] <uGoMobi> we didn't really decide yet but it's true that we all thought that's probably better
[04:57:22] <arschmitz> yes they are
[04:57:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we should not be doing anything to collapsible besides removing its demos and marking the widget deprecated in api
[04:57:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, but then we don't have to add a new way to set styles with CSS classes
[04:58:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The classes Kangsik has added are not widget-specific, AFAIK, even ui-corner-all-force.
[04:58:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if we have corner inheritance issue with accordion, we can use them.
[04:59:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Kangsik: Please don't forget the demos and the API docs, either!
[04:59:12] <arschmitz> thats telling them to do work that does not need to be done
[05:00:10] <_|Nix|_> Are we gonna grab the API docs for accordion?
[05:00:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz is right that we better first make a decision about when we adopt accordion
[05:00:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: documentation will be interesting we will need to figure that out
[05:00:45] <arschmitz> its not as simple as tabs
[05:01:00] <arschmitz> because it has style and we will add the theme option
[05:02:13] <_|Nix|_> TBH I think the best way forward would be to implement collapsible and collapsibleset using accordion. That would give us a perfect replacement. After we've done that, we can simply say that instantiating an accordion via .collapsible() or .collapsibleset() is deprecated and then later remove it.
[05:02:38] <_|Nix|_> I think that because that would guarantee that we don't accidentally break our own collapsible/collapsibleset API.
[05:02:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i disagree they are fundamentally different
[05:02:54] <arschmitz> and we cant break a deprecated api
[05:03:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: one is a single widget and one is interaction between 2 widgets
[05:03:34] <_|Nix|_> You can implement two different widgets using one widget.
[05:03:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sure does not make it a good idea though
[05:04:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its no different then replacing dialog widget with dialog extension
[05:04:47] <arschmitz> one does replace the other in a sense but not directly they are different things they do not share api
[05:04:59] <arschmitz> they work differently
[05:06:02] <_|Nix|_> I suppose if we simply declared collapsible and collapsibleset to be deprecated and pointed devs at accordion, then that would deflect as much of the migration burden from us as possible.
[05:06:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in some cases we need a backcompat layer ie slider
[05:06:21] <arschmitz> because slider is slider in both
[05:06:25] <arschmitz> so the apis need to coexist
[05:06:48] <arschmitz> but with collapsible / set they can coexist with no extra work
[05:06:59] <arschmitz> just like dialog
[05:07:07] <_|Nix|_> Whereas if we were to implement the old widgets using the new widget, we would be minimizing devs' migration burden at our own expense.
[05:07:19] <uGoMobi> what is the reason that we don't wait with accordion until 1.7 as planned?
[05:07:33] <uGoMobi> I admit that I said +1 as well last week
[05:07:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there was none we were just trying to space things out
[05:07:53] <arschmitz> and had given higher priority to selectmenu
[05:07:53] <uGoMobi> but now I think of it, I am not sure if it's a good idea
[05:08:09] <uGoMobi> because we already have a lot of work to do for 1.5
[05:08:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this is noi real work its pretty much done
[05:08:26] <arschmitz> and we have to do work no matter what
[05:08:27] <_|Nix|_> We haven't even looked at UI's dialog yet, and /that's/ scheduled for 1.6.
[05:08:43] <arschmitz> because if we dont switch we need to waste effort on something we are removing
[05:08:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: our dialog vs our dialog extension
[05:08:52] <arschmitz> not ui dialog
[05:09:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Huh? The roadmap lists dialog under "Adopt from jQuery UI"
[05:09:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... to replace popup.
[05:09:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you look at my jsbin its already a full widget extension 
[05:09:35] <_|Nix|_> That's the dialog I'm talking about.
[05:09:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it just needs testing and cleaning up
[05:10:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ui dialog is not a concern yet and i already have that working in mobile too
[05:10:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, but I just got the feeling that we have a lot of things that are just a little bit of work
[05:10:52] <uGoMobi> but together it's a lot
[05:11:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so you think its better to waste time on a little biut of work for something we are removing rather then something we are keeping?
[05:11:08] <_|Nix|_> I suspect this will be confusing to people, even though we've followed due process on deprecation. That's because, as of 1.6.0, .dialog() will result in something completely different than .dialog() in 1.4.0.
[05:11:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: lets not worry about that now its not an issue today
[05:11:36] <arschmitz> this is
[05:11:45] <_|Nix|_> OK. So, if not collapsible, then which widget?
[05:11:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: huh?
[05:12:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Which widget shall have its boolean-valued style options removed, if not collapsible?
[05:12:25] <_|Nix|_> Onto which widget shall the web-ui-fw team move next?
[05:12:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what we discussed last week was that we should ask them to look at porting accordion
[05:13:52] <arschmitz> we can put the code from the jsbin into a proper branch and have them write tests and do any needed cleanup
[05:14:08] <arschmitz> instead of working on collapsible
[05:14:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, that's not what I am saying. My only point is that we have to be careful that we don't want to do too much for 1.5 because otherwise it will take too long before we can release
[05:14:24] <_|Nix|_> Let's remember that the work done so far is not necessarily widget-specific.
[05:14:46] <_|Nix|_> We've made a point of making sure that the classes introduced for dealing with accordion are not accordion-specific.
[05:14:57] <_|Nix|_> So, the class may be useful for another widget.
[05:15:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: regardless you asked me what we should have them work on
[05:15:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i didnt say throw away what they have done
[05:15:29] <arschmitz> i said they should not be working on collapsible
[05:15:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, and I'll put that on the table, but I'm also trying to identify a second widget where such overrides that are already implemented will come in handy.
[05:16:01] <arschmitz> um maybe controlgroup
[05:16:14] <arschmitz> i think that uses the same sort of corner inheritance
[05:16:26] <arschmitz> and toolbars in popups for the top corners maybe?
[05:16:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Excellent!
[05:16:53] <arschmitz> i cant think of anything else off the top of my head there might be more though
[05:17:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ill set that jsbin up properly in a branch so they can start from that too
[05:17:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: controlgroup does indeed have "corners", "shadow", and "mini" which will need to be deprecated, so that may be a good target.
[05:18:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: almost all the widgets have somethign that needs to be from that group
[05:18:32] <_|Nix|_> ... and controlgroup also has the same inheritance issues as collapsible, although in the case of controlgroup, they are already solved correctly - via CSS.
[05:19:36] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'll write an email.
[05:19:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thank you 
[05:20:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IIRC, yourfullname@gmail.com is the address you wanna use, right?
[05:20:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we just really need to make sure we are communicating what we want to them properly and clearly i dont want to see any one wasting time and effort. 
[05:21:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: correct, don't forget the "m" after jasper
[05:22:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you're right
[05:22:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: might be good to update our roadmap
[05:22:59] <arschmitz> if we are all happy and ok with this direction now yes
[05:23:26] <uGoMobi> and then list the widgets listed in the wiki in the order we are going to work on them (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.5-Style-options-removal)
[05:25:55] <uGoMobi> we better wait with deprecating style options of selectmenu as well
[05:26:13] <uGoMobi> as long as we didn't decide when we adopt the new one from UI
[05:31:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: selectmenu is most likely to far out right now to worry about yet
[05:31:12] <arschmitz> there is still no native version
[05:31:26] <arschmitz> and wont be until at least well into 1.6 on the ui side
[05:34:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I sent the email. In it, I ask you to reply with the name of the branch against which to file accordion-related PRs.
[05:45:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sounds good
[05:46:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: so i think we are pretty much ready to release page-events-demo is ready and green just need to pull to branches
[05:46:27] <arschmitz> and the updates for api and jquerymobile.com are ready
[05:46:34] <arschmitz> the only thing that concerns me is the builder issue
[05:46:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome
[05:46:59] <arschmitz> im not sure we want to release with a broken builder
[05:47:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I just asked Corey again
[05:47:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's what I was thinking
[05:47:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: but i need to run to a dr's appt for a few hours
[05:47:20] <arschmitz> ill be back
[05:47:34] <arschmitz> email me if you need anything and ill respond or jump on with my phone
[05:47:41] <uGoMobi> I don't think we should release until the builder is fixed
[05:47:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i agree
[05:47:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you restore the changelog branch?
[05:47:59] <uGoMobi> or did I do that somehow?
[05:48:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes i needed to see something on it
[05:48:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok
[05:48:26] <uGoMobi> talk later
[05:48:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: later
[05:49:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: L8R
[05:53:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did we already figure out how the root could end up in the transitions folder on demos.jquerymobile.com?
[05:58:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, but I got the impression that a manual intervention was necessary.
[05:59:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[05:59:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That is, someone checks out the repo, fixes it up, commits and pushes it back.
[06:21:58] <cgack> uGoMobi I was under the impression that we could do a test release and verify if the transitions are fixed
[06:26:22] <uGoMobi> cgack: yeah, was just wondering if someone found out how this happened
