[04:09:49] <gabriel_schulhof> ?tell arschmitz I've gone through the excercise of updating the classes option in response to style option value changes, both at instantiation and during _setOptions. It's quite a bit of code: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/d1ec32e8cc6efda12446c237acdcd85cc2c9c173
[04:09:50] <b-ot> gabriel_schulhof: Iâ€™ll tell arschmitz about that.
[06:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks tj_vantoll

[08:13:13] <arschmitz> gseguin|away: Ping!
[08:47:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[08:47:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[08:47:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[08:48:00] <gabriel_schulhof> So, what do you think about that code?
[08:48:12] <gabriel_schulhof> It's a sizable chunk, but I don't see any other way of doing it.
[08:49:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i need to look closer
[08:49:35] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[08:49:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: why are you handling theme-
[08:50:08] <arschmitz> we should just document that is not part of classes
[08:50:29] <arschmitz> there is no sane way to do that
[08:51:01] <gabriel_schulhof> WHy not? It's pretty simple. If you wish to theme something explicitly, you just add the appropriate theme class to the class key's value.
[08:51:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Otherwise it inherits.
[08:51:25] <gabriel_schulhof> It's the same as corners or shadow.
[08:51:40] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and don't forget: The theme option itself, like theme: "a" will be gone.
[08:52:01] <gabriel_schulhof> So, you're only recourse will be to add the theme class to the value of the appropriate classes key.
[08:52:18] <gabriel_schulhof> ... unless of course we continue to restrict ourselves to the boolean class options.
[08:52:48] <arschmitz> that was the plan
[08:53:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, yeah, I guess. The thing is though the swatch-related classes like ui-body-* and ui-overlay-* are just as generic as ui-corner-all and ui-shadow. So, they can be handled the same way as the rest of the style options.
[08:54:39] <gabriel_schulhof> There's never a need to parse a className in order to determine what the element's theme is.
[08:56:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we have never decided to to deprecate any of the theme options
[08:56:48] <arschmitz> in 1.5
[08:57:01] <arschmitz> only style options like corners and shadow that are boolean
[08:57:15] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, but if we don't, then the code to update the corresponding class key has to stay.
[08:57:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we just document that swatch classes are not part of the classes option
[08:57:58] <arschmitz> and dont change anything for them
[08:59:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, so the value of the class key need not be updated when the theme changes.
[08:59:52] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: exctly
[09:00:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: swatches are on their way out and really complicate things
[09:00:17] <arschmitz> so we just say swatch !== theme
[09:00:32] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[09:00:37] <arschmitz> its like swatch == theme lol
[09:01:49] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I'll revise the popup code to not cover theme.
[09:05:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What about wrapperClass? I vote we deprecate, because this.options.classes[ "ui-popup-container" ] duplicates the functionality.
[09:05:16] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:05:20] <arschmitz> thats gone
