[17:05:05] <darkfrog> I'm trying to write a server-side source for Autocomplete but nothing I return seems to work. I'm not getting a JavaScript error and the server is getting called, but I simply can't get the autocomplete to pop up as I type. What mime-type and data structure do I need?
[17:05:17] <darkfrog> I've been trying text/plain and application/json
[17:05:19] <darkfrog> to no avail
[17:08:13] <darkfrog> I've tried newline separated results (One\r\nTwo\r\nThree), basic JSON (["One", "Two", "Three"]) and even the separation between label and value: ([{label: "One", value: "1"}, {label: "Two", value: "2"}, {label: "Three", value: "3"}])
[17:09:04] <darkfrog> I'm using jQueryUI 1.9.1 if that makes any difference.
[17:31:06] <gnarf> darkfrog: support in #jquery
[17:31:39] <gnarf> darkfrog: also, if you have a link to your broken attempt, it will help others help you
[17:32:20] <gnarf> but im on my way to sleep, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5077409/jquery-ui-autocomplete-server-side-example-what-does-a-request-json-response-lo seems correct from my memory
[17:32:35] <gnarf> make sure its actually JSON too
[17:32:47] <gnarf> i.e. quoted properties
[17:32:51] <gnarf> night!

[19:10:52] <gamesNmusic> How do I remove the yellowish border that appears when a tab is in focus on the tabs widget (base theme)?
[20:39:15] <Rafajafar> is this the place for jqueryui support?
[20:39:35] <Rafajafar> or is that in #jquery

[22:27:15] <_zoggy_> did jquery 1.8.3 change how it its selector works? 
[22:28:14] <_zoggy_> $('#blah').val(); worked in 1.7.x when the input was named blah now it only works if it's id is blah
