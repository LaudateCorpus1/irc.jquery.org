[04:01:05] <Lincoln> i am interested in working on your project i.e. jquery- new demo system. i have a bit of experience in HTML,javascript and CSS and i do hope it would help me. recently i created a coding website dotcode.in
[04:31:38] <M4rius> For introducing pep in the interactions branch: I get quite a few failed tests in the interactions branch (~140, mostly in draggable and other interactions related widgets). With PEP and pointerevents I do get the same number of failed tests, but I feel like thats still not the way it is supposed to be (having 140 failing test). Should I: A) just write tests for the new interactions.js B) investigate the dragable bugs (they are likely caused by 
[04:31:39] <M4rius> interaction.js) or C) Try to update to the current master.
[04:33:46] <M4rius> Please choose one of the three letters, or, alternatively take one of three doors, where we have a car, a scooter and a goat, respectively.
[04:33:55] <M4rius> (ping scott_gonzalez jzaefferer)
[04:40:05] <jzaefferer> M4rius: All three doors have goats, and the goats like mud wrestling
[04:41:38] <jzaefferer> M4rius: you could give c) a try first. I guess that it'll be messy, since draggable was rewritten in the interactions branch and got a lot of bug fixes in master
[04:46:55] <M4rius> Ok nice. Mud wrestling sounds always good.
[04:48:22] <M4rius> i will try to stepwise pull changes from master into interactions, wish me luck :>
[04:58:35] <georgeous> Any graphics designer / mobile website developers looking for paid work? pm me or email george@enabl.es Thanks!
[05:07:49] <arschmitz> georgeous: this is not the place for that
[05:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> M4rius: If you're not comfortable with massive rebases, don't even bother trying that.

[10:03:26] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Well, the limited review I've done in the round (it gets shorter each time!) looks good.
[10:03:30] <scott_gonzalez> I think we're ready to merge.
[10:05:18] <interestinall> Hey arschmitz and jzaefferer: there was some talk about the new demo system gsoc idea being developed further in terms of specifics. Is there any news? I took the feedback from the last UI meeting and sketched a jsbin for datepicker default functionality and made it responsive. I tested it in the latest versions of chrome, firefox and safari. The color scheme fits a bit better now since it uses the official colors and I kept the
[10:05:18] <interestinall>  css to a minimum. I didn't style the calendar itself but I will if you like the direction. Here's a link to the bin: http://jsbin.com/xapayi/23/edit?html,css,output
[10:29:46] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: on nested suites I wrote back in October: "One thing I noticed: The diff in this PR has no occurrence of "async". Especially in the context of the kinda-global before/afterEach method that seems like a big mistake." - I'm not sure what I was worried about there, any idea?
[10:31:13] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: Not 100% positive but I'm guessing something with managing the state of async lifecycle hooks. I need to review the state of PR code to confirm/reject that interpretation.
[10:39:44] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: okay, thanks. I'll check it out again sometime soon as well
[11:06:17] <Areeb> I am interested in demo system project and wanted to proceed further .I have tried to contact mentor but no one respond me.
[11:06:43] <arschmitz> Areeb: which project?
[11:06:48] <arschmitz> oh demo system sorry
[11:07:41] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: awesome
[11:07:56] <arschmitz> interestinall: ill look when i get a second in 100 places right now
[11:09:30] <arschmitz> Areeb: Not all of that task can be worked on yet. The jsbin integration is waiting on some things. but if you want to start looking at getting involved you can try to look at out current demos and improve one or more. also please read https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students if you have not already
[11:09:51] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: there is not an open issue for anything in that pr is there?
[11:10:01] <arschmitz> i could not find anything searching real quick
[11:11:26] <interestinall> arschmitz: thanks!
[11:11:46] <scott_gonzalez> For anything in which PR?
[11:12:01] <arschmitz> classes sorry
[11:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yes!
[11:12:16] <arschmitz> got a link?
[11:12:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7053
[11:12:35] <arschmitz> sweet
[11:12:43] <arschmitz> searching "classes" didnt get that for some reason
[11:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> Only 4 years!
[11:13:00] <scott_gonzalez> I wrote that ticket on a couch in Vienna.
[11:13:15] <arschmitz> nice
[11:13:24] <arschmitz> there is a mobile issue on it too
[11:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: That was a productive trip, minus the time that we had to do the semantic web stuff :-P
[11:13:45] <arschmitz> that because of how they wrote it originally should be closed by this
[11:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> We should go again!
[11:14:24] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: it was great when i was there last year
[11:15:07] <Areeb> actually i have  integrate jsbin in my webpage .Can you please suggest me what i  should submit in sample code
[11:16:13] <arschmitz> Areeb: the jsbin integration will be through an api and a link not just posts or an iframe. This api is not available yet which is why this part cannot be worked on
[11:16:30] <arschmitz> Areeb: to get started i suggest you work on improving an existing demo
[11:17:26] <Areeb> ok ...sorry I will try it 
[11:19:41] <Areeb> Sir I had tried to contact you from the beginning onward but we have a conservation today.Can you please tell me how i can be in regular discussion with you
[11:23:15] <arschmitz> Areeb: this is the best place but im not always available please be patient
[11:24:39] <Areeb> ok..but sir it takes almost 8 days thats why i  was worried
[11:24:51] <arschmitz> Areeb: also you left less then 30 minutes after pm'ing me last time i cant respond if your not online
[11:26:51] <Areeb> any way now  i come to know how to proceed further  thanx sir...
[11:40:27] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so once i add the issues to the first commit classes it ok for me to land on master?
[11:41:43] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: I'm good with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1478/, thanks for asking!
[11:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks gabriel_schulhof.
[11:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yeah, put Fixes in the Widget commit and then Ref in the rest.
[11:43:00] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the rest of the classes option ones.
[11:43:13] <arschmitz> right
[11:43:16] <scott_gonzalez> They should all get a Ref for the PR.
[11:43:41] <arschmitz> yup but only the widget commit should have the issues right?
[11:44:12] <arschmitz> well issue lol
[11:44:16] <scott_gonzalez> The widget commit should have Fixes for the issue, but the rest of the classes option commits should have Ref for the issue.
[11:44:23] <arschmitz> ok
[11:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> And then all the other test commits should not reference any issue.
[11:46:09] <arschmitz> perfect

[11:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, that should actually be easy to fix.
[11:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> Just choose my change and then update the assertions. At least it's very straight forward.
[11:59:23] <arschmitz> yeah im not worried about i had just thought i was going to be good for once because i had just updated yesterday lol
[11:59:25] <scott_gonzalez> It's just a bunch of `.is( ".ui-state-focus" )` checks.
[11:59:31] <scott_gonzalez> hah

[11:59:46] <scott_gonzalez> At least I was nice and waited for the .removeAttr() change.
[11:59:49] <arschmitz> yeah test changes are the worst for this pr
[12:00:15] <scott_gonzalez> I've been waiting for this to land so I could work on that.
[12:01:03] <arschmitz> lol
[12:01:16] <arschmitz> yeah this is an easy change i can actually do it with a search an replace

[13:17:49] <arschmitz> ALL ME!
[13:18:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Do we need to pull the widget factory from UI again?
[13:18:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: kinda
[13:18:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Respect.
[13:18:32] <arschmitz> i need to pull it to button
[13:18:39] <arschmitz> then button needs to be pulled from ui
[13:26:46] <interestinall> hey arschmitz: I'm getting of IRC soon. I see you and the others are really busy. Should I send my message again to your email so you can have a look when you have the time (and I am probably offline)?
[13:28:54] <arschmitz> interestinall: was it about the demo?
[13:30:00] <interestinall> arschmitz: yup. if there had been updates on the idea yet and what you thought of the bin I sketched on the basis of last weeks UI meeting suggestions
[13:30:55] <arschmitz> interestinall: the one you linked today im not really just has 2 side by side in a box with a media query and colors
[13:31:10] <arschmitz> you dont need the colors
[13:31:28] <arschmitz> we are really just looking for a more realistic usage 
[13:31:29] <arschmitz> like
[13:32:15] <arschmitz> http://view.jqueryui.com/button-classes/demos/controlgroup/toolbar.html perhaps
[13:32:48] <arschmitz> you dont need to add custom style unless it actually adds something to the demo 
[13:33:18] <arschmitz> interestinall: but for example this one could also use some media queries to handle the toolbar better on small screens too
[13:40:52] <interestinall> arschmitz: I could add media queries to this no problem. I guess I don't understand what "realistic" means here. Most of the demos, as presented now, would not be used that way IRL with no style and no context. Could you give an example of how you would make them more realistic. This text editor is a great composite example. Are you looking for more composite examples with no styling + responsive? Is the JSbin integration largely a
[13:40:52] <interestinall>  matter of keeping what is there now and putting it into bins? 
[13:44:36] <arschmitz> interestinall: realistic can be as simple as using real lables and names
[13:44:38] <arschmitz> like http://jqueryui.com/button/#radio
[13:44:59] <arschmitz> make those something realistic not jusr choice 1 2 3
[13:45:44] <arschmitz> but there is also a bigger issue of we are not sure we want to continue to put the demos into the site in the same way as we do now
[13:45:53] <interestinall> ok. so what I did would be right if I take out the color/border
[13:46:10] <arschmitz> for a basic usage example yes
[13:47:19] <interestinall> ok :) as for the future: are you leaning toward composites?
[13:47:47] <arschmitz> no real plans
[13:47:51] <arschmitz> but gotta run
[13:48:07] <interestinall> ok. thanks for the feedback!

[15:33:32] <apsdehal> leobalter: Can you explain me how to use Qunit-migrate repo of yours?
[15:33:52] <apsdehal> I tried filing an issue, but you haven't replied on it yet
[15:36:11] <arschmitz> apsdehal: your the one i talked to about mobile tests
[15:36:15] <arschmitz> right?
[15:36:36] <apsdehal> Yes
[15:37:17] <arschmitz> i think i might want to go a slightly different direction with that
[15:37:35] <apsdehal> Ok, explain me a little bit
[15:37:52] <arschmitz> Well i mentioned looking into intern
[15:38:32] <arschmitz> Intern provides cross platform ci right out of the box which qunit does not
[15:38:47] <arschmitz> and we dont have a way to do with mobile and qunit right now
[15:38:49] <apsdehal> Yes
[15:38:55] <apsdehal> I had looked into their apis
[15:39:12] <arschmitz> so instead of updating to qunit 2 i think i want to look into switching to intern
[15:39:34] <arschmitz> they have a test interface which supports the current qunit api too
[15:39:55] <arschmitz> so lets start with trying to get intern setup on mobile and port a single test suite to it
[15:40:01] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/167
[15:40:05] <arschmitz> but still using the qunit api
[15:40:21] <arschmitz> those are not qunit
[15:40:21] <apsdehal> I have also seen this pr which shifts its tests to Intern
[15:40:27] <arschmitz> yes
[15:41:13] <apsdehal> Then I should file a PR that includes setup of intern, further port a test suite
[15:41:32] <arschmitz> if you would like to sure!
[15:41:49] <apsdehal> Yes, I would ping you here when PR is ready
[15:42:36] <arschmitz> ok
[16:13:40] <eacar> good evening 
[16:14:38] <eacar> hello all ?
