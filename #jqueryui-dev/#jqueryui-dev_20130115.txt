[06:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8950
[06:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> Any reason not to add .ui-widget input { color: inherit; } ?
[06:17:44] <scott_gonzalez> Seems annoying that we even need to do that.
[06:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> Why do browser defaults win here?
[06:19:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I guess this makes sense, now that I'm building a reduced test case.
[06:20:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just going to add color: inherit on .ui-spinner-input.
[06:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> Since that's what's killing the default background.

[13:52:15] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov i hope your day was better than mine... howd updating test go for you last night?
[13:52:30] <mikesherov> no progress
[13:53:19] <Dave_Stein> dun dun dun
[13:53:39] <Dave_Stein> well today i slammed my shin into the corner of a wall, a bird shat on my ( luckily only hit my pants... on the same shin strangely ), and i found a horrible bug i had to fix
[13:53:46] <Dave_Stein> so ive had no progress today on anything i wanted to do ha
[15:34:23] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov simulate is blocking iisn't it?  i can't tell if I'm misusing that or containment is that bugged as I try to write tests for the commented out options

[16:40:33] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: um, what do you mean by blocking?
[16:40:34] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: last night I was fixing up effects
[16:40:58] <mikesherov> i had to take advantage of petro and scott_gonzalez to hash out some details
[16:41:19] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov im about to leave but i mean uh
[16:41:39] <Dave_Stein> if i do a simulate and then an equal right after... the equal will not fire until simulate is done moving
[16:41:43] <Dave_Stein> im assuming thats a yes
[16:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[16:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> It's synchronous.

[16:42:20] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06master_tests 14b219040 15Dave Stein: Draggable: Added test for disabled
[16:42:22] <Dave_Stein> i was getting some weird numbers when attempting to test the other things in containment
[16:42:24] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you perform an async event, like focus.
[16:42:46] <Dave_Stein> like i did testDrag and it said the result was 8 rather than 50 or 100 
[16:43:10] <Dave_Stein> i was trying to test that i can drag it right if the containment is document and then if i go to -200 it will only move the distance it was at
[16:43:33] <Dave_Stein> so if i move from 100 to -200 i'd expect it to be at 0
[16:43:36] <Dave_Stein> but i was getting wnoky numbers
[16:43:37] <mikesherov> right, synchronous
[16:43:37] <mikesherov> just like real events
[16:43:48] <Dave_Stein> yeah i thought so
[16:43:51] <Dave_Stein> but the 8 was troubling ha
[16:45:10] <Dave_Stein> ill try and make more sense of it later and/or when im working on it and you're around but gotta go meet up with people for dinner now
[16:45:28] <Dave_Stein> ttyl
[20:33:55] <mikesherov> petro?
[20:34:13] <petro> yo
[20:34:39] <mikesherov> sup?
[20:34:51] <mikesherov> so I have a beefy pull for you
[20:35:40] <petro> yeah i'm still grokking it
[20:35:51] <petro> had to catch up with some feature work tonight
[20:36:16] <mikesherov> of course!
[20:36:18] <mikesherov> No problem
[20:36:53] <mikesherov> basically, it provides $.fn.cssClip which is getter/setter for the clipObj
[20:37:12] <mikesherov> so sets clip based on obj, or parsesClip and returns obj
[20:37:32] <petro> very nice!
[20:37:59] <mikesherov> and then a stepHook for clip, which essentially allows an animation to provide a end clip as a string or as a clip object
[20:38:10] <mikesherov> and will animate all for clip values independently
[20:38:54] <petro> me gusta
[20:39:05] <petro> next, i'll rewrite the blind effect to use that
[20:39:23] <mikesherov> so you can say $(element).animate({clip: {top:1,left:1,right:1,bottom:1}});
[20:39:25] <petro> merged
[20:39:38] <petro> now that's totally badass
[20:39:59] <mikesherov> or you can say: $(element).animate({clip: "rect( 1 1 1 1 )"});
[20:40:06] <mikesherov> and they both work
[20:40:13] <petro> now i see why that step hook is essential
[20:40:31] <mikesherov> in the case of the clip effect, you still need to parse clip outside of the animation
[20:40:39] <mikesherov> because the end animation is based off the original
[20:40:49] <petro> yep
[20:40:53] <mikesherov> but for most effects, you can know the end clip without that
[20:41:02] <petro> actually, not really
[20:41:06] <mikesherov> :-\
[20:41:08] <petro> same for the others as well
[20:41:13] <mikesherov> hmmm
[20:41:23] <petro> we want to preserve the top/bottom clip when blinding left/right
[20:41:34] <petro> likewise for left/right when blinding top/bottom
[20:41:46] <mikesherov> OH, that's the other thing I was thinking about
[20:41:56] <mikesherov> you should be able to specify a partial
[20:42:06] <mikesherov> like only top: left: if you want
[20:42:08] <petro> yes, perfect
[20:42:15] <mikesherov> the right and bottom would keep current values
[20:42:36] <gnarf> look at the patterns used for the hooks in color
[20:42:39] <mikesherov> that might make more sense for something like blind that doesn't need complex math to find center per se
[20:42:42] <gnarf> for some inspiration on how to handle it
[20:43:01] <petro> i would *love* to be able to specify clip values as percentages as well
[20:43:11] <petro> even though that's not in the spec
[20:43:17] <gnarf> petro: does it work?
[20:43:22] <gnarf> or does it only support px?
[20:43:23] <mikesherov> right, scott and I were talking about even relative values
[20:43:33] <gnarf> {top: "+=100%"
[20:43:46] <mikesherov> gnarf, spec says no for string
[20:43:55] <gnarf> if you could actually get it css hooked for parsing it
[20:43:57] <mikesherov> but the object can be our own twisted machination
[20:44:15] <gnarf> the animation core has some builtin logic for += / -=
[20:44:39] <mikesherov> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/876
[20:44:40] <b-ot> mikesherov, pull request #876 by mpetrovich (1w 6d ago): Effects: Rewrote "clip" effect to animate CSS clip property
[20:46:27] <gnarf> nice
[20:46:58] <gnarf> I'd be nice to abstract all the clip stuff out into a plugin too
[20:47:00] <mikesherov> yeah, pretty cool
[20:47:06] <gnarf> it'd
[20:47:08] <gnarf> *
[20:47:31] <mikesherov> so the placeHolder stuff works well, and the clip stuff does too
[20:47:46] <mikesherov> it's actually coming along nicely for what started out as a crazy idea
[20:48:13] <petro> I just realized we need to support all the other <length> units as well: px, em, rem, pc, cm, mm, etc.
[20:48:26] <petro> http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visufx.html#propdef-clip
[20:48:34] <mikesherov> petro, focus on px for the moment
[20:48:56] <mikesherov> we can easily say we don't support initial clip values
[20:49:06] <mikesherov> but note it
[20:49:44] <mikesherov> meaning we don't support ones ther than px
[20:50:18] <mikesherov> g2g
[20:50:33] <petro> night
[20:51:15] <mikesherov> I'm eager to see blind
[20:51:23] <mikesherov> petro: when you getting in tomorrow?
[20:51:48] <petro> probably 9, gotta catch up on sleep
[20:56:50] <mikesherov> k
[20:57:03] <mikesherov> Cool, touch base at 9 then?
[20:57:08] <mikesherov> if not, no biggie
[20:57:14] <mikesherov> would just love to get a few moments
[21:11:43] <petro> sure
