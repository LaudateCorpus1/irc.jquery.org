[13:08:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[13:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:13:28] <kborchers> when you say "Ability to disable individual menu items", do you mean programmatically? If you add the ui-state-disabled class to any menu item, it is disabled. I guess i need to add that to the visual test.
[13:13:36] <kborchers> you can see it here though http://view.jqueryui.com/menubar/demos/menubar/default.html
[13:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> If adding the class works, feel free to remove the TODO. It came from a ticket in Trac.
[13:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't spend any time to investigate.
[13:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8089
[13:14:55] <kborchers> ok, i'll add to one of the menus in the test, and then update the ticket and wiki
[13:15:03] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[13:17:52] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Check out what I've done to easings :-) https://gist.github.com/8777be721b19b09b1d54#file_easings.js
[13:18:28] <scott_gonzalez> I just need to figure out how to invert the bounce logic so that the logic is inside the In easing and I can move that into the generator too :-)
[13:19:51] <kborchers> Math is HARD ;P
[13:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> Seriously. A lot of what I did was trial and error.
[13:20:44] <scott_gonzalez> Let's try subtracting 1. Nope. Ok, let's try subtracting from 1. Nope. Ok, let's try multiplying by 2 here, and diving by 2 here...
[13:21:13] <kborchers> yeah ... that's what i would do. no way you could just look at that and know what to change. well, maybe you could now ;)
[13:21:36] <scott_gonzalez> I was never good at this type of math.
[13:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> That's what my TI-89 was for.
[13:22:03] <kborchers> Exactly!!
[13:22:48] <kborchers> I aced AP Calc in HS (calculator allowed), then couldn't test out of calc in college (no calculator on the test)
[13:23:43] <scott_gonzalez> HAHA
[13:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> I got a 5 on the AP calc test, and that was all I needed to test out of college calc
[13:25:09] <scott_gonzalez> Done for the day. Later.
[13:25:55] <kborchers> cya
[13:25:58] <kborchers> hah
[13:26:13] <kborchers> meant see ya, but reads as CYA
[13:26:29] <kborchers> guess it works either way :P
[13:31:49] <kborchers> damn ... disabled items almost work but not quite :(
[13:49:54] <rubyruy> are there any commons solutions to cloning elements with widgets in them?... the data() copying isn't deep enough
[13:50:07] <rubyruy> and really it should re-init the widget objects if possible
[14:13:12] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] kborchers pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/3vcDqw
[14:13:12] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu: Prevent clicking on disabled menu items and remove unnecessary extra padding from disabled items. - kborchers
[14:14:35] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #227: STILL FAILING in 1 min 12 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/227/
[14:14:35] <jq-jenkins> kris.borchers: Menu: Prevent clicking on disabled menu items and remove unnecessary extra padding from disabled items.
[16:53:34] <scott_gonzalez> rubyruy: No. Unsure if it'll ever be supported.
[16:54:16] <rubyruy> tis ok, after some pondering I think newContent is the best solution
