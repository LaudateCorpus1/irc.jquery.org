[04:04:06] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, about jquery-ui vs. doc mapping, you've said:
[04:04:07] <bot-t> (22 hours 10 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell rxaviers: Yes, metadata is gone in 1.10.0.
[04:04:08] <rxaviers> "If it's the latest version (which we already said we need to be able to distinguish, e.g., by first index), then use master. For anything else, use major-minor."
[04:04:11] <rxaviers> So, what do you mean by first index? Take doc's `git tag` newest tag (last line)? If it's newer, then use master. If it's older, then use tag?
[04:05:10] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, (about metadata), ok thanks. That has implications for DB and unit tests...

[05:35:12] <mikesherov> oh, thats cool
[05:35:58] <mikesherov> PR notification!
[05:37:06] <kborchers> mikesherov: yeah, gnarf and scott_gonzalez got that worked out the other day. i like it a lot! :)
[05:37:07] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: what are your thoughts on this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/836
[05:37:15] <mikesherov> kborchers: ^
[05:39:01] <kborchers> mikesherov: looking
[05:39:08] <mikesherov> so, if someone manually unfocuses the button between keydown and keyup (which is the click event in some browsers), then active state wasn't removed
[05:39:54] <kborchers> mikesherov: shoot, just realized i have to run an errand before my meetings this morning â€¦ i'll look asap
[05:40:04] <mikesherov> k, no rush
[05:40:13] <mikesherov> just saw you were on, thanks again!

[06:02:13] <jzaefferer> Krinkle|detached: this looks indeed more useful: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/499707 - gnarf: can you check that effects failure? pointing at tests/jquery-1.7.2.js on line 8988
[06:03:29] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: looks good to me. But the its usually scott_gonzalez who catches subtle errors in small changes like that.
[06:08:08] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez mikesherov: how do you catch that U+200B?
[06:16:02] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: just created the agenda for today's meeting - can you update the triage numbers?

[06:48:02] <kborchers> mikesherov: also looks good to me

[07:28:13] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: about docs versions: for "stable", use "master", I think that's what scott_gonzalez was saying.
[07:28:28] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: did you have other open questions? I lost track
[07:29:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, for every other legacy version/tag, will be there an equivalent doc tag?
[07:33:59] <rxaviers> If we have jquery-ui tags: [1.9.0, 1.9.1, 1.10.0], and doc tags: [1.9.0, 1.10.0], I am able to return the greater doc-tag for a certain jquery-ui-tag, being "master" the highest one. I mean: for {jquery-ui , doc} => [{1.9.0, 1.9.0}, {1.9.1, 1.9.0}, {1.10.0, 1.10.0}, {<anything else>, master}]
[07:34:30] <rxaviers> anything else = anything else higher than 1.10.0 or a branch
[07:35:33] <rxaviers> I think that would always work correctly (like we manually would do)

[07:36:30] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06dialog 14e88ddf2 15JÃ¶rn Zaefferer: Dialog: Follow-up to 9fe3a62d8 - also deprecate string notation for position option.
[07:43:48] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: there's a single branch for 1-8 in docs, there will be a single branch for 1-9. So if legacy is 1.9.x, use 1-9. 1.10.11, use 1-10. 1.10.255 -> 1-10
[07:44:13] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: see also https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/branches
[07:47:32] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ah! scott_gonzalez was talking about branches, not tags. Aff!! Ok
[07:47:56] <rxaviers> I see, thks
[08:02:03] <jzaefferer> mikesherov kborchers rxaviers: Scott probably won't be around for the meeting and I may end up a few minutes late. Please start anyway, I've updated the agenda for today.

[10:01:46] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: do you work in NYC?
[10:02:37] <mikesherov> Yup!
[10:02:59] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: I was thinking of doing a local mini Dev summit
[10:03:25] <Dave_Stein> ah cool
[10:03:32] <mikesherov> Johnkpaul ajpiano rwaldron you and others are in NYC
[10:03:38] <Dave_Stein> i was just thinking it'll be easy for us to coordinate tests and code when it gets to that point
[10:04:46] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: Yes
[10:04:54] <mikesherov> We should meet up for sure
[10:05:01] <ajpiano> yeah mikesherov i really want to do that, have you figured anything out with timing at work?
[10:05:08] <ajpiano> juan pablo said he could also prob host
[10:05:21] <mikesherov> Get scott_gonzalez to come out. Have dinner, and plan interactions
[10:06:15] <Dave_Stein> where is his office? If we were gonna meet after hours or a weekend it'd be easy to host here as well
[10:06:16] <mikesherov> ajpiano: We can do it during one of SNAP's hack days, or we can do it one night, or we can do it somewhere else during the day
[10:06:31] <mikesherov> I'm 35th and 7th
[10:06:38] <Dave_Stein> probably during day too if it came down to it
[10:06:42] <Dave_Stein> I'm on spring and broadway
[10:06:44] <ajpiano> i think that just having a night once every 2 3 weeks for like 3 4 hours would be rad
[10:06:58] <ajpiano> though i could also do it during the day prob  depdning on the day
[10:07:02] <mikesherov> Yes
[10:07:12] <Dave_Stein> Our meeting room is good like 9 people... up until new office cant wait
[10:07:14] <mikesherov> Night is better
[10:07:56] <Dave_Stein> figured would be
[10:07:57] <Dave_Stein> damn "jobs"
[10:11:03] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov ajpiano it'll be easy to figure this out after holiday shuffle anywho
[10:11:32] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: But I will still hold a grudge that you never tried hero academy against me lol
[10:11:46] <ajpiano> haha i installed it i just haven't played it once
[10:12:53] <Dave_Stein> what was that other one your friend mentioned? some town name I can't recall
[10:13:16] <ajpiano> other what?
[10:13:34] <Dave_Stein> some other iphone game 
[10:14:16] <ajpiano> i'm not sure
[10:14:44] <Dave_Stein> i shall shed one small tear ;)
[10:15:25] <bigmac99> I am working on an html form, and using jquery for a date field.  I have multiple date fields on this form.  I can use this ---> $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker(); for the first field, but not any of the others.  I'm sure I'm doing something wrong,  can anyone help? Thanks in advance.
[10:16:04] <Dave_Stein> bigmac99: jquery room is probably the better place to ask
[10:16:29] <bigmac99> is that just #jquery like that?
[10:16:42] <Dave_Stein> yup
[10:17:01] <bigmac99> ok thanks Dave_Stein

[17:01:41] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: any thoughts on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/825#issuecomment-10619931
[17:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: It was horrible.
[17:01:54] <mikesherov> :-\
[17:02:12] <mikesherov> sorry to hear that. Hard to move on the busiest travel day of the year?
[17:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> We weren't able to fit everything, stayed up till about midnight packing. Got up at 6:30a and continued packing.
[17:02:43] <scott_gonzalez> Battery was dead in the truck, had to wait an hour for the mechanic to come out with a new battery.
[17:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> So Kristin left while I was waiting.
[17:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> Tons of traffic.
[17:03:11] <scott_gonzalez> We took different routes, she ended up a few hours behind me.
[17:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> And she has the key to the storage unit.
[17:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> So I can't even start unloading the truck yet.
[17:03:30] <mikesherov> oh wow, so you
[17:03:40] <mikesherov> so you're just waiting now?
[17:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> And since we didn't fit everything, I need to go back down this weekend and rent a small truck.
[17:03:51] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[17:04:11] <mikesherov> sucks
[17:05:04] <mikesherov> And here I was about to complaining that the LIRR shut down so I was stuck in the city for a few additional hours. 
[17:05:25] <mikesherov> sorry to hear that, hopefully the rest goes a bit smoother
[17:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully, I need to figure out how I'm getting back to NC this weekend.
[17:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look at flight and train options tomorrow.
[17:06:49] <mikesherov> driving is out of the question?
[17:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it takes way too long and I need to drive the truck back anyway.
[17:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> So if I drove down, I'd need to tow the car behind the truck, which doesn't sound fun.
[17:07:47] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, Amtrak is 10 hours.
[17:08:10] <mikesherov> oh, you still have another car thereâ€¦ is there an acela?
[17:08:24] <mikesherov> acela train could probably make that 5 hours
[17:08:37] <DaveMethvin> acela is dc-bostonn
[17:09:02] <DaveMethvin> best you could do is like philly-dc and then the slow train from there
[17:09:20] <mikesherov> well, I took acela to DC from NY

[17:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> I can't do one in December, but if you guys do this again, I can probably come out.
[17:18:38] <mikesherov> if it's at SNAP it would have to be like 6:30â€¦ if earlier, maybe johnkpaul can host
[17:18:41] <ajpiano> yeah i think we want to do it semi regularly
[17:18:52] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: definitely
[17:19:03] <ajpiano> buritica said he also might be able to get soe space
[17:20:28] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: now that you're (almost) PA, NYC becomes a viable trip
[17:20:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah but he has to go through NEW JERSEY
[17:21:02] <mikesherov> haha
[17:21:10] <ajpiano> there are ways around it :p
[17:21:17] <mikesherov> i love new jersey

[17:39:07] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06progressbar 141679687 15Kris Borchers: Progressbar: Add test to make sure indeterminate progressbar doesn't trigger complete event.
[17:39:26] <kborchers> mikesherov: ^^^ work for you?
[17:40:08] <mikesherov> Looking
[17:42:06] <mikesherov> kborchers: I'm on mobile, but the test looks like its proving it does fire complete
[17:42:17] <mikesherov> Maybe I just don't have enough context?
[17:42:47] <kborchers> mikesherov: it proves it doesn't fire complete until the value is 100 which happens after the value is false â€¦ otherwise that deepEqual would fail
[17:42:51] <mikesherov> Oh, nvm
[17:42:55] <mikesherov> Right 
[17:43:00] <mikesherov> I see
[17:43:07] <mikesherov> Sorry about that
[17:43:10] <kborchers> np
[17:43:18] <mikesherov> Thanks for putting up with me!
[17:43:28] <mikesherov> I think it's good to merge now
[17:43:38] <kborchers> thanks for checking all of my work and keeping me honest on tests :)
[17:43:48] <kborchers> ok merging in a bit
[17:44:10] <mikesherov> Good stuff... That'll bring us down to 22 PRs and 415 tickets
[17:44:52] <mikesherov> Tests are the only way! :D
[17:45:26] <mikesherov> Ok g2g. Ping me if you need me
[17:45:47] <kborchers> ok, thanks again mikesherov have a good one
[19:02:03] <kborchers> anyone still around to answer a merging question? rworth mikesherov ajpiano 
[19:05:11] <kborchers> gnarf ^^
[19:05:28] <gnarf> ya?
[19:06:08] <kborchers> heh, i think i just answered my own question
[19:06:21] <gnarf> awesome
[19:06:23] <kborchers> you be around for a minute if it doesn't work?
[19:06:51] <kborchers> ok still need help
[19:07:46] <kborchers> gnarf: so if i'm merging the progressbar branch into master, should i merge which will create a merge commit or should I rebase which will put all of those commits on top? i don't like either of those options
[19:08:35] <kborchers> hmmm, but if i rebase master on progressbar, then merge progressbar into master, would that work?
[19:10:17] <gnarf> kborchers: merge --squash , make it a single commit, reference the pull request # from the branch just like any other pull I'd imagine
[19:10:25] <gnarf> unless you can make it fastforward
[19:10:28] <gnarf> with a rebase
[19:11:31] <kborchers> gnarf: ok, i'll try squashing, etc. makes it more fun with conflicts :)
[19:11:33] <kborchers> thanks
[19:13:42] <kborchers> gnarf: actually looks like rebasing then merging let it fast forward
[19:14:03] <gnarf> nice
[19:14:46] <kborchers> gnarf: maybe you can help my brain though. is it not weird that the commit dates are out of order now though?
[19:14:56] <kborchers> or is that normal after rebase
[19:18:01] <gnarf> thats normal after a rebase
[19:18:20] <gnarf> doesn't really matter that much - one of the reasons i usually just go for a squash, they are usually very quick operations :)
[19:19:50] <mikesherov> kborchers: I'm here
[19:20:14] <kborchers> mikesherov: too late ;)
[19:20:41] <mikesherov> so, just to answer what I always do, is a always `git rebase master`
[19:21:20] <mikesherov> and I actually do `git rebase master --interactive`, and then I usually "fixup" all the commits expect the first, so they all squash down
[19:21:33] <mikesherov> then I checkout master, and "git merge <branchname>"
[19:21:56] <kborchers> mikesherov: yeah, i think i'm going to redo with a squash â€¦ i did the rest the same
[19:22:12] <mikesherov> cool
[19:22:40] <kborchers> mikesherov: gnarf only problem is some of the commits reference bugs so i'll have to manually close those if i squash, right?
[19:22:56] <mikesherov> kborchers: which is why I use interactive
[19:23:19] <gnarf> kborchers: just put all the "Fixes #..." in the main commit message
[19:23:29] <mikesherov> your commit message should say "Fixes #xxxx - yadayada. Fixes #xyxy - yadatatatata"
[19:23:38] <gnarf> ^^^^ that
[19:23:55] <kborchers> ok, combine the fixes â€¦ got it. can you tell most of my work has been on new dev with menu? :D
[19:24:00] <mikesherov> but with interactive rebase, you can "squash" the ones you want to keep the message for, and "fixup" the ones you just want to squash
