[14:51:59] <scott_gonzalez> Se√±or kswedberg, are you around?
[15:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ping
[15:09:53] <gnarf> hey scott_gonzalez
[15:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> hey gnarf
[15:10:20] <gnarf> I'm thinking about trying to get on top of plugins better tomorrow
[15:10:46] <gnarf> you gonna be around?
[15:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yup.
[15:11:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to get through this XSL insanity for all the new API sites.
[15:11:14] <gnarf> Cool, I've got like 2 plugins to stge
[15:11:53] <gnarf> also, I've been thinking about trying to get the "builders" for each of the staged sites running - the things that grunt deploy on post-receive
[15:12:07] <gnarf> Pretty sure I can knock that one out fast
[15:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> Once I finish with the XSL files, I'm going to switch back to the plugins site to finish up some stuff now that the designers have implemented more.
[15:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> Cool, well I'll be around all day except for lunch.
[15:12:40] <gnarf> sounds good
[15:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll probably be gone from 11:00a - 1:00p ET.
[15:13:45] <scott_gonzalez> Monthly lunch with the local JS meetup group :-)
[15:15:59] <kswedberg> hey scott_gonzalez: sorry, afk. won't be around for another few hours.
[15:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: It's a real quick question.
[15:16:20] <kswedberg> ok, go for it.
[15:16:51] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have any objection to moving the API notes directly into the XSL?
[15:17:04] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/3398153
[15:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> This actually removes the need for pre-processing.
[15:18:14] <kswedberg> dunno. seems a little out of place there, since it's mostly content that needs to be injected.
[15:18:29] <kswedberg> oh. well, in that case...
[15:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking we can actually move it into notes.xsl and just <xsl:import> it.
[15:19:40] <kswedberg> sorry, gotta go.
[15:19:44] <kswedberg> sure, that makes sense.
[15:19:46] <kswedberg> do it
[15:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, later.
[16:31:31] <ben_alman> can someone who knows about deferreds tell me if i'm going insane? http://jsfiddle.net/cowboy/8ShzF/
[16:35:33] <ben_alman> nm i'm insane.

[19:27:04] <kborchers> would the real scott_gonzalez / scottgonzalez please stand up
[19:30:51] * scott_gonzalez sits down
[19:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure what's going on with the double name.
[19:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> heh, figured it out
[19:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> I blame jzaefferer
[19:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> and his unstable ZNC server
[19:39:33] <kborchers> :)
[20:54:35] <kborchers> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez i moved download to a small section on the home page of qunitjs.com and deployed to stage. let me know what you think
