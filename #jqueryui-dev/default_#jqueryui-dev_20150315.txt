[07:49:39] <M4rius> hey there, i have been running unit test for my modifications on the interactions branch in the browser and a solid 90% pass. On the cmd line via `grunt test` I get bucket loads of failures and timeouts. Do you know some way to debug these failed tests? (on my local master `grunt test` runs perfectly)
[07:54:28] <arschmitz> M4rius: fix the 10% failing in the browser
[07:54:40] <arschmitz> they are likely the cause of the timeouts
[07:56:05] <M4rius> arschmitz: those are kind of tricky ones >.>
[07:56:47] <M4rius> Maybe i wil go with commenting them out for now. Though there are tests that certainly fail on the cmd line and work just great in the browser
[07:57:23] <arschmitz> M4rius: well i would almost guarantee if you fix them all in the browser it will fix them in phantom as long as your sticking to ES3. 
[07:59:27] <M4rius> ah ok, i will give it a shot, thx
[08:00:29] <M4rius> btw. should all tests succeed for merging master into the interaction branch? 
[08:00:40] <arschmitz> M4rius: probably not
[08:01:21] <M4rius> ok good *phew*
[08:04:56] <arschmitz> M4rius: there have been TONS of updates to the tests
[08:05:20] <arschmitz> and some to the widgets too
[08:05:27] <arschmitz> on master that are not in interactions
[08:05:27] <M4rius> indeed
[08:05:40] <arschmitz> id be pretty suprised if there were not TONS of conflicts when you merged
[08:05:52] <M4rius> yes there are
[08:06:59] <M4rius> It was mostly like: a little bit of this, litte bit of that, this._super() can't hurt, _mouseXX  be gone, ... :D
[08:08:00] <M4rius> In the case of sortable.js, it overwrites mouse.js behaviour which is certainly going to be fun for the interactions rewrite
[08:08:32] <arschmitz> M4rius: well and i added a new option AND updated the test for each of the interactions this week on master
[08:08:40] <arschmitz> and deprecated some stuff
[08:08:59] <M4rius> right that major epic new feature!
[08:09:08] <M4rius> fun fun fun for the merge >.>
[08:09:15] <arschmitz> yup :-)
[08:09:30] <M4rius> I wonder at what point I should set up a PR
[08:10:55] <M4rius> So far I merge up to the point the branch has gone towards converting widgets from using mouse.js to using interactions.js
[08:12:42] <M4rius> Though there is not much resemblance with the old interactions branch and it rathers looks like the master branch with a few renames (which results in surprisingly few failures)
[09:00:11] <kundan> hi guys
