[03:04:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: data-add-back-btn="true" ... setting that on the page rather than the toolbar is deprecated, right?
[03:04:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ^
[03:04:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[03:05:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: D00d! You're up?
[03:05:29] <uGoMobi> yeah, looks like it ;)
[03:05:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But thanks!
[03:06:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you're welcome
[03:06:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll add that to the 1.4-changelog.
[03:06:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, it's there.
[03:07:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But, like, if it's set on the page, shouldn't we support that for one more version of deprecation?
[03:07:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure, we don't deprecate the feature, just make a change how to use it
[03:11:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: toolbar was part of page widget. the data- attr moves with toolbar to its own widget
[03:11:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so it would mean we would also have to support toolbars with the new toolbar widget for one version
[03:11:54] <uGoMobi> without*
[03:13:06] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#773 (master - 37b5e79 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build passed.

[03:15:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. WORKSFORME.
[03:16:20] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.7.x core build #404: STILL UNSTABLE in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.7.x%20core/404/
[03:16:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, wait a sec. No. We continue to fully support the header/footer/fixedToolbar API, but we have changed the internal implementation by using the toolbar widget.
[03:17:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nevertheless, I'm still OK with not giving a period of deprecation for the page data-add-back-btn attribute.
[03:19:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... although it would be easy to provide such deprecation: if ( this.element.parents( ".ui-page,:jqmData(role='page')" ).attr( "data-" + $.mobile.ns + "add-back-btn" ) ) { this.options.addBackBtn = true; }
[03:20:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This would be kosher, since toolbar.js AMD-depends on page.js.
[03:21:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am thinking about problems with external toolbars
[03:22:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, for those the above check would return false.
[03:23:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If a toolbar is used outside of a page, there is no page element on which to set data-add-back-btn, so the dev /has/ to set it on the toolbar itself.
[03:24:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, at this point I gotta ask: Why does toolbar even AMD-depend on page?
[03:25:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't know. if we support external toolbars, how can it AMD depend on page?
[03:26:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: something to ask arschmitz 
[03:27:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I still think we shouldn't add code to make data-add-back-btn still work on page
[03:27:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, AMD-dependency doesn't necessarily mean it needs a page to be present in the DOM. It simply means that it needs some code from the page plugin.
[03:27:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's fine. I'll document it that way.
[03:27:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the feature is option addBackBtn with moves with toolbars to its own widget
[03:28:48] <uGoMobi> thanks
[03:30:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, just meant that toolbars don't need anything from page as far as I know. You should just be able to use them without page at all. But let's ask arschmitz 
[03:31:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: <strong>The options <code>addBackBtn</code>, <code>backBtnTheme</code>, and <code>backBtnText</code> have moved from the page widget to the <placeholder name="name"/> widget as of jQuery Mobile 1.4.0.</strong>
[03:31:40] <_|Nix|_> Bam!

[04:50:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you around?
[04:50:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Morning
[04:51:35] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[04:51:59] <arschmitz> hey hows austin so far?
[04:52:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hot
[04:52:41] <arschmitz> yeah i checked its going to be in high 90's all week
[04:53:43] <uGoMobi> how much is that in C?
[04:55:49] <arschmitz> 32
[04:55:49] <arschmitz> -33
[04:56:04] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[04:56:12] <uGoMobi> yeah, feels already like that
[04:56:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what time do you arrive?
[04:56:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[04:56:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[04:56:43] <arschmitz> i think tomorrow it could get up to 36 i saw
[04:56:51] <uGoMobi> wow
[04:56:58] <_|Nix|_> Nasty!
[04:57:03] <uGoMobi> yeah
[04:57:09] <_|Nix|_> It's at most 22
[04:57:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: how did you get from the airport to the hotel just a taxi?
[04:57:12] <_|Nix|_> here
[04:57:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I took a bus
[04:57:53] <uGoMobi> line 100 goes every half hour
[04:58:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does the hotel have an outdoor pool by any chance?
[04:58:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You could tell people the keynotes will be held there :)
[04:58:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nope, only indoor pool
[04:58:28] <uGoMobi> lol
[04:58:32] <_|Nix|_> Booo! -1
[04:59:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i land at 11:40
[05:00:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: so i was thinking yesterday. maybe we should deprecate buttonmarkup whatever of it has previously been documented
[05:00:37] <arschmitz> all it does is class toggle
[05:00:37] <arschmitz> devs can do this just as easy them selves
[05:00:59] <arschmitz> at least as a public api that is
[05:01:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's not bad.
[05:01:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, the fact that we've reduced it to some class shuffling makes it kinda superfluous.
[05:01:35] <arschmitz> removing autoinit on links and buttons will improve performance too
[05:01:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it's like enhanced="true" or bust :)
[05:02:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you also mean that we don't support data-role="button" for link buttons anymore?
[05:02:52] <arschmitz> yeah i think it should just be part of theme
[05:03:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's right. data-role="button" simply selects the link for enhancement.
[05:03:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This is something we can solve purely with CSS. So, let's do that.
[05:04:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : +1
[05:04:52] <uGoMobi> but we have to look into when we do this
[05:05:02] <_|Nix|_> Yesterday! :)
[05:05:32] <uGoMobi> we also want to remove style options from the JS, like corners, shadow, etc
[05:06:06] <uGoMobi> I think we should do both things at same time
[05:06:29] <arschmitz> yup
[05:06:30] <arschmitz> all it does is say hey add some classes
[05:06:30] <arschmitz> why not just write in the classes your self its no harder
[05:06:30] <arschmitz> and its confusing with button widget since its not a widget when its a link or button
[05:06:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: infact listview is much the same it has no dynamic behivor outside set options which just class toggles 
[05:06:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: makes sense
[05:06:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: buttonMarkup is the single biggest repository of style options. It's /all/ style options, and, unlike other places we don't have special cases (like corners + ui-first/last-child), so it can go even now.
[05:07:06] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:07:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: one thing i realized when writing my talk is you have to add data-role="none" to a button to add classes your self rather then autoinit it which is annoying
[05:07:09] <_|Nix|_> OK, so ... we deprecate as of 1.5.0?
[05:07:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I noticed that too
[05:08:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yup, I think we should deprecate in 1.5
[05:08:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll open an issue then.
[05:08:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: i think we should consider deprecation of listview as it is now and make it just part of themeing and add classes your self but we will need to look at autodividers
[05:09:25] <arschmitz> this is big with listviews because they can be so long
[05:09:38] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #6451: Deprecate buttonMarkup  02http://git.io/c1REPQ
[05:09:39] <arschmitz> just like with buttons because you can have so many
[05:10:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, we already deprecated some stuff in there in 1.5, like the functions that add classes to heading and paragraphs, and images (thumbs)
[05:10:54] <uGoMobi> I think the split button doesn't need JS either
[05:11:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: seems to me like any widget that does not add any event handlers or do any real dom manip or add some sort of dynamic behavior should not be a widget
[05:11:23] <uGoMobi> agreed
[05:11:34] <arschmitz> awesome
[05:11:56] <arschmitz> nice to push more out of js and just into part of css theme
[05:12:03] <arschmitz> so much better for perf!
[05:12:09] <uGoMobi> we just have to be careful with wanting to do everything for 1.5
[05:12:54] <uGoMobi> we will get same situation as now with 1.4
[05:12:57] <arschmitz> i think these should all be done when we remove style options because with out those these dont do anything any more
[05:13:17] <uGoMobi> yup
[05:13:33] <arschmitz> yeah its too bad wer didnt take the plung and deprecate style options in 1.4
[05:13:39] <arschmitz> well.....
[05:13:44] <arschmitz> its not too late
[05:13:54] <arschmitz> because it would have to stay for backcompat
[05:14:01] <arschmitz> so we dont need to DO anything
[05:14:06] <arschmitz> besides say its deprecated
[05:14:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can't deprecate without having an alternative forward.
[05:14:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes we would have to make the new way work already
[05:14:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there is no new way
[05:14:33] <arschmitz> new way is do it your self
[05:14:38] <arschmitz> which you can already do
[05:14:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but we'd have to document that.
[05:15:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For example, things like data-wrapper-class="ui-btn ui-btn-b ui-corner-all"
[05:15:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in some cases the style class goes on the generated div wrapper
[05:15:18] <arschmitz> document it is just saying adding them is deprecated add the classes your self 
[05:15:37] <uGoMobi> not sure if we have wrapperClass everywhere already
[05:15:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats what classes option is for
[05:15:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if we dont it would take 2 seconds to add it
[05:16:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its just add option and when we make wrapper add it in
[05:16:40] <arschmitz> to me it seems like this goes with new theme
[05:16:48] <arschmitz> and so changes should be in same version 
[05:17:02] <arschmitz> though i understand its quite late now
[05:17:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see your point
[05:17:22] <_|Nix|_> checkboxradio,flipswitch,button,textinput, and popup have wrapperClass.
[05:17:32] <arschmitz> so does toolbar
[05:17:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and I also can't wait until we moved that stuff from JS to CSS
[05:18:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe we should talk about this more this afternoon. _|Nix|_ any chance you will be free later today?
[05:18:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ummm ... not according to js -type f | xargs grep -niH wrapperClass
[05:18:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmmm let me check on that
[05:18:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll try to make time.
[05:18:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: doh your right sorry
[05:19:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but why would toolbar need wrapperClass? What gets wrapped?
[05:19:09] <arschmitz> oh yeah duh
[05:19:20] <arschmitz> it does not need it
[05:19:29] <_|Nix|_> NP. It's actually good that we did not miss anything :)
[05:19:45] <_|Nix|_> So, have we covered all widgets that wrap?
[05:19:53] <arschmitz> execpt slider
[05:20:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Dang!
[05:20:06] <arschmitz> which is going to be deprecated and replaced 
[05:20:11] <arschmitz> but we could add it anyway
[05:20:20] <arschmitz> its like a 2 second change to add it
[05:20:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm all in favour of this deprecation business ...
[05:21:26] <uGoMobi> the only thing that keeps me from saying "yes, let's do this now" is that we keep coming up with things to improve the framework but this also delays our releases
[05:21:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i think though its a less then ideal time its better to do this right the first time then break it up 
[05:21:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i totally understand
[05:22:03] <uGoMobi> we have to learn to stop at some point and just get the new version out
[05:22:09] <arschmitz> however if this only requires adding option to 1 widget then this will not delay us
[05:22:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. We're kinda far along and I get the feeling that we haven't really mapped out all the consequences.
[05:22:17] <uGoMobi> we took more than half a year for 1.4
[05:22:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah me too
[05:22:46] <uGoMobi> 2 second changes always scare me a bit
[05:22:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, deprecation is not removal.
[05:22:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol yeah 
[05:23:15] <uGoMobi> that often means we dont' write unit test, don't update docs and demos, etc
[05:23:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats kinda my point here is its just an api note really
[05:23:29] <arschmitz> other then slider
[05:23:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, if we do the wrapper class, then it's slider too.
[05:23:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[05:24:13] <arschmitz> but i think adding that option is an acceptable risk that this point IF thats all we need to do
[05:24:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and for theme, for example, I did an include so you can just deprecate theme in one place and all the widgets will list it as deprecated.
[05:24:50] <arschmitz> if there is a bug that crops up from it well there could be a bug we need to fix in anything at this point
[05:24:53] <_|Nix|_> ... especially since we've already added such an option to textinput, button, popup, et. al., so we know how to do it.
[05:25:09] <arschmitz> yup and it adds option consistancy to widgets
[05:25:20] <arschmitz> EVERYTHING that needs it will have it
[05:25:35] <arschmitz> instead of now wwhere its everything -1
[05:25:37] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I guess you could also consider this a forgotten widget review item.
[05:25:39] <arschmitz> that seems lame lol
[05:26:16] <_|Nix|_> I think slider should have this option whether or not we deprecate style options.
[05:26:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i agree
[05:26:45] <arschmitz> and if we add it then deprecation is at that point trivial because its just a not with ZERO code change
[05:26:54] <arschmitz> so it will not effect release schedule
[05:27:10] <_|Nix|_> But anyway, you guys can duke it out (pretty soon, literally). I'm diving back into toolbar API-land.
[05:27:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sounds good we will try to get you once we are in the same place and ready to figure this out
[05:27:53] <_|Nix|_> ... where I had the question of whether we should deprecate adding data-add-back-btn to page or just outright remove it.
[05:28:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You can skype me: gabriel_schulhof
[05:28:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh yeah saw that in back scroll
[05:28:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome thanks
[05:28:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, how come toolbar AMD-depends on page?
[05:28:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: legacy 
[05:29:04] <arschmitz> it can be updated
[05:29:16] <uGoMobi> I am want to finish upgrade guide today and we should prepare devs for 1.5 in there
[05:29:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you mean?
[05:29:32] <arschmitz> it needed to before does not any more
[05:29:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, so I can just flat-out remove the dependency?
[05:29:52] <arschmitz> yup 
[05:30:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, sweet!, Now /that's/ a 1-second change :)
[05:30:09] <arschmitz> :)
[05:30:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i agree
[05:30:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about jquery.mobile.widget?
[05:30:50] <arschmitz> id love to go ovwer what you have on that so far with you
[05:31:02] <uGoMobi> so it does affect release schedule
[05:31:13] <uGoMobi> also think we should add demos for it
[05:31:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No! I'll simply remove the dependency and run the tests :)
[05:31:20] <uGoMobi> which takes time
[05:31:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah all widgets need that for autoinit
[05:31:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can push what I have so far.
[05:31:50] <arschmitz> so i guess thats an optional dep so no need in amd
[05:31:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: They do? I thought autoinit was in page.js.
[05:32:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: mobile.widget reads data- attributes
[05:32:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right ... sorry ... _getCreateOptions ...
[05:32:36] <arschmitz> but that should not AMD depend because they will work just fine without
[05:32:55] <arschmitz> just will have to pass the options like a normal widget
[05:33:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's an interesting perspective. Perhaps this should then be part of autoinit.
[05:34:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: $.widget( name, { _getCreateOptions: function() {} } ); $.widget( name, $.namespace.widgetName, proto );
[05:34:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That way, the autoinit code shims not only $.widget, but also the prototype passed into $.widget.
[05:35:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i dunno though because this seems like its own thing not explixtly autoinit
[05:35:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but then it has to sit somewhere ...
[05:35:47] <arschmitz> it should be its own thing that can be included or excluded
[05:35:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and the widget does have to depend on it to get it.
[05:35:58] <arschmitz> and nothing should depend on it
[05:36:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's kinda hard to define.
[05:36:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think we can ponder this post 1.4
[05:36:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For sure.
[05:36:35] <arschmitz> ok i gotta run boarding
[05:36:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: have a safe flight!
[05:37:03] <arschmitz> thanks take care
[05:37:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: see you later
[05:37:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: safe travels
[05:37:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: will reply to your email about directions to hotel
[08:04:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping! The fixedtoolbar entry has a paragraph about polyfilling old platforms with toolbars that reposition in response to scrolling. I doubt that polyfill still works with our reviewed toolbar widget. Should we continue to document it?
[08:07:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... I don't even know how I would go about testing that polyfill ... Have we not c-graded all browsers that would need such polyfill?
[08:42:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I will remove touchOverflowEnabled from the lib and the docs, because it has been flagged for removal since 1.1.
[08:44:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What?! It says in the code that touchOverflowEnabled shall be defined until 2.0?!
[08:46:09] <_|Nix|_> Well, whatever ...

[13:49:58] <ylandsman> I am developing a website where I am loading a dialog via ajax.  I would like to place previous and next buttons on each side of the dialog to trigger loading a different record into the dialog.  What would be the best way to go about this?

[14:13:46] <ylandsman> ok thanks I'll switch channels
