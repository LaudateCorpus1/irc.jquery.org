[04:47:03] <jzaefferer> scottgonzalez: datepicker is even more broken: http://jsbin.com/pibebusi/1/edit http://jsbin.com/faveviko/1/edit - I couldn't find existing tickets for these issues
[04:49:41] <scottgonzalez> That second fiddle isn't correct, based on datepicker's design.
[04:49:48] <scottgonzalez> The wrapper div never goes away.
[04:50:03] <scottgonzalez> It's a singleton for non-inlines.
[06:20:28] <jzaefferer> scottgonzalez: but the first one is an actual issue, right?
[06:21:19] <scottgonzalez> jzaefferer: yeah
[06:21:34] <scottgonzalez> The second one should definitely not happen in the rewrite.
[06:21:44] <scottgonzalez> There shouldn't be any singletons.
[06:22:02] <scottgonzalez> Did you run into this on a project?
[06:22:02] <jzaefferer> right
[06:23:09] <scottgonzalez> uGoMobi: Regrading https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7207 did you see https://github.com/jquery/css-framework/issues/2 ?
[06:26:56] <jzaefferer> scottgonzalez: Yeah, same project as mentioned, datepicker is the only UI component they use
[06:33:19] <mikesherov_> scottgonzalez: about effects re-write
[06:33:21] <uGoMobi> scottgonzalez: yes I did see you ticket and I agree we should make it easy to add/remove icons
[06:33:29] <uGoMobi> s/you/your/
[06:33:57] <mikesherov_> Right now, almost every effect calls element.show() unconditionally at the beginning
[06:34:14] <mikesherov_> in the effect definition
[06:34:29] <scottgonzalez> uGoMobi: I'd be nice if we could just defer to something like iconic for the icons.
[06:34:49] <scottgonzalez> But it'd be bad to default to a paid icon set.
[06:34:49] <mikesherov_> because the main effect runner knows to do a no-op the second time if you call .show('blind') twice
[06:35:14] <mikesherov_> the rewrite also knows to do a no-op if you call .show('blind') twice
[06:35:28] <mikesherov_> but doesn't do the default element.show()
[06:35:51] <scottgonzalez> mikesherov_: Does it handle .show( "blind" ).hide( 1 ).show( "blind" ) ?
[06:35:51] <mikesherov_> so in master, calling .effect('blind') twice does the effect twice
[06:36:09] <scottgonzalez> I think .effect() should queue multiple times.
[06:36:17] <mikesherov_> yes, it knows exactly the same way as master does
[06:36:29] <scottgonzalez> .show() should as well, but the second one should see that the element is visible and be a noop.
[06:36:34] <mikesherov_> right, so .effect() does queue multiple times in both cases
[06:36:42] <mikesherov_> in master and rewrite
[06:36:55] <mikesherov_> however, in rewrite I don't do the obligatory element.show() in the effect definition
[06:37:03] <mikesherov_> so I just need to add that back in
[06:37:11] <scottgonzalez> ok
[06:37:26] <mikesherov_> it *seemed* superfluous when I was rewriting, but I didn't know it was for that behavior
[06:37:52] <scottgonzalez> Are you able to unit test this?
[06:38:04] <mikesherov_> I want to wait until after 1.11 is released, but I want to write a bunch of unit tests for effects... at least for all the regressions I introduced
[06:38:23] <scottgonzalez> Ok, so for now just make sure there's a clear comment.
[06:38:35] <mikesherov_> yeah, I have a list of all the things that bit me
[06:38:47] <scottgonzalez> great
[06:41:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[06:41:04] <mikesherov_> Anyway, that and the IE8 fold bug, and making sure a few also animate the placeholder are the bugs left
[06:41:15] <mikesherov_> scottgonzalez: I should be very close
[06:41:36] <scottgonzalez> Awesome, I can't wait to land this in master.
[06:41:53] <scottgonzalez> I should be able to test again as soon as I get my MBP back.
[06:41:55] <mikesherov_> there is some followup refactoring I want to do, but that'll wait for 1.11.1
[06:42:19] <mikesherov_> at this point, I want it to land without much more refactoring
[06:42:32] <scottgonzalez> That's fine.
[06:42:44] <scottgonzalez> I just want them working better :-)
[06:44:09] <scottgonzalez> Ugh, I need to get the 1.9.3 release done too.
[06:45:34] <mikesherov_> scottgonzalez: yeah, there's a few bugs in master that are visible in the demo
[06:45:49] <mikesherov_> like scale winds up in the wrong spot after scaling
[06:46:06] <mikesherov_> but anyway, I digress
[06:46:10] <mikesherov_> see you at the meeting

[07:02:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Pong!

[07:05:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: after works good
[07:05:44] <arschmitz> and i think i figured something awesome out for it
[07:06:05] <arschmitz> i have it working with like 3 changed lines
[07:06:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[07:06:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the key is you CANT use same markup or handlers
[07:11:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you also cant decide which to use at the time of the click because you cant use the same markup
[07:13:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So when do you calculate the height of the <ul> so as to decide whether it's too tall?
[07:13:22] <arschmitz> pageshow, throttledresize, orientationchange
[07:14:04] <arschmitz> oh and refresh
[07:14:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In that case, for selectmenus outside the framework, you must call .refresh() when you know it's visible.
[07:15:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We must remember to document that.
[07:15:08] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:16:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... the popup is hidden ... it's width/height is truncated to 0.
[07:16:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm it seems to be working for me this way do you actually hide the popup or is it just off screen
[07:17:02] <arschmitz> otherwise you would have to show it before deciding on the click which is not the case
[07:17:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's offscreen, but the width/height is truncated to 0.
[07:17:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so I guess the list overflows into the truncated areas of the popup, so it retains its real width/height.
[07:20:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... you'll need to wait for window.load because pageshow is too early.
[07:20:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's the same problem as subtracting external toolbar height from the pag.
[07:20:28] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:20:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we need to publish the deferred that gets resolved at window.load()
[07:21:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but that would break the containment of the selectmenu.
[07:21:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, we could add another window.load() listener into the selectmenu code.
[07:21:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, at the top of the IIFE.
[07:22:06] <arschmitz> yeah we will have to think about it
[07:22:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's too bad core doesn't offer a convenience like $( function() {}) for window.load.

[08:57:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Morning! I think we can't use cheerio. It converts the &nbsp; to a space in <script>tags :/
[08:58:06] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: hmm... is that a bug?
[08:58:32] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: if it is, has it been fixed in a more recent version?
[08:58:47] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: Maybe domino then?
[08:58:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think so: <script>var x = "<div>&nbsp;</div>";</script> loses the &nbsp;
[08:59:02] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll try the latest version and then domino.
[08:59:40] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: Does it transform it into a escaped unicode sequence? or simply loses it?
[08:59:45] * scottgonzalez feels like a noob asking this question...
[08:59:51] <scottgonzalez> Can someone unmute #jquery-meeting for me?
[09:00:09] <gseguin> scottgonzalez: I'll try
[09:00:15] <scottgonzalez> Thanks gseguin.

[09:05:07] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It seems to be a space, but it could be a &nbsp; rendered correctly by my console.
[09:05:18] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The fact is that it shouldn't make any changes though.

[10:59:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what I just found.
[10:59:50] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to un-op you so you can test it :-P
[11:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: The AOP commands aren't working, tried two different formats.
[11:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the second format actually was correct, but it said I can't execute it.
[11:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[11:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's see if the normal op helps at all (probably not after you log out).

[13:55:16] <scottgonzalez> A selectable item or a non-selectable item?
[13:55:25] <mikesherov_> non-selectable
[13:55:32] <mikesherov_> clickable, but I want to control that behavior
[13:55:54] <scottgonzalez> Override the _renderMenu() method and add the item after calling _super().
[13:55:56] <mikesherov_> like "no exact match found, click here to create it"
[13:56:21] <mikesherov_> makes sense. Thanks
[13:57:03] <scottgonzalez> Alternatively, for that specific use case, you can just listen to the autocompletechange event and see if there was an item selected.
[13:57:20] <scottgonzalez> If not, you can ask the user if they want to add the value they entered.
[13:57:32] <scottgonzalez> But it might be tricky to create a good UX around that.
[13:58:16] <mikesherov_> right
[13:59:13] <mikesherov_> one last question: if I override the method on an instance instead of extended via the prototype, do I still get access to _super(), or do I have to duckpunch at that point?
[13:59:42] <scottgonzalez> You still get _super()
[14:00:07] <mikesherov_> nice, thanks for permitting me to ask a #jquery question here
[14:01:15] <scottgonzalez> :-)
[14:13:00] <scottgonzalez> Hmm...Apple says they're waiting for a HDD bracket to be delivered. I guess that means there's hope they'll return a useful laptop instead of a blank laptop...
[15:06:51] <gnarf> mikesherov_ CHEATER!
