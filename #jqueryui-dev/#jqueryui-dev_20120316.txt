[17:19:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you around?
[17:20:16] <kborchers> hope not, just remembered it's your birthday
[17:20:29] <kborchers> ?tell scott_gonzalez happy b-day!!
[17:20:29] <bot-t1> kborchers, Okay.
[17:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> thanks kborchers
[17:52:49] <bot-t1> (32 mins 10 secs ago) <kborchers> tell scott_gonzalez happy b-day!!
[17:53:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: :)
[17:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> what's up?
[17:53:41] <kborchers> so did someone give you a birthday present and kill trac today ... got no e-mails all day
[17:53:58] <kborchers> spam filter going nuts again?
[17:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> There was one this morning for mouse.
[17:54:34] <kborchers> yeah, but usually like 20 or 30 a day it seems
[17:55:04] <kborchers> maybe it just "seems" that way :P
[17:55:18] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, it's not that much. It's only a few a day, though the other day there were a lot.
[17:55:30] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph?days=7
[17:56:09] <kborchers> ok, maybe it was just the other day then :)
[17:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> There's something wrong with core's trac though.
[17:56:27] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if you get emails for core tickets.
[17:56:34] <scott_gonzalez> But I think that's been broken for a few days.
[17:57:01] <kborchers> no, i haven't been blessed with that access yet ;)
[17:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually been a really long time since I've gotten notifications for all tickets for core.
[17:58:12] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea what's wrong. My account is set for all new and changed tickets, but I haven't gotten emails in several months.
[17:58:24] <scott_gonzalez> But that seems to be just my account.
[17:58:40] <scott_gonzalez> The other day a few people were saying they stopped getting emails though.
[17:58:55] <kborchers> hmmm, weird
[17:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> And I know there were comments on tickets that I've commented on, which I'm pretty sure has worked for me before.
[17:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> Or maybe it only sends me notifications for tickets that I created.
[17:59:26] <kborchers> i'm not even sure if i have an account :/
[17:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> Either way, it's not doing what it's supposed to for me.
[17:59:31] <kborchers> thought i did but can't log in
[17:59:53] <kborchers> yeah, sounds like a problem there
[18:00:45] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...core's admin looks totally different than UI's admin.
[18:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? They don't have a user admin page.
[18:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> That or I have have limited admin access, which wouldn't make sense.
[18:01:40] <kborchers> or you don't have access?
[18:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...maybe my account is limited, I can't even get to the permissions admin page.
[18:02:34] <kborchers> i just created an account so, i guess i didn't have one
[18:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> I find it strange that I have admin access, but it's limited access.
[18:02:50] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: btw, in UI trac, are you able to update my username?
[18:03:10] <kborchers> or maybe i can
[18:03:19] <kborchers> can't seem to find a way to do it though
[18:03:39] <kborchers> just want to get rid of the _ ... not sure why i put it in there
[18:03:47] <scott_gonzalez> I can change your password or delete you account, but I can't change your username.
[18:03:52] <kborchers> damn
[18:03:56] <kborchers> ok
[18:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> I think there are two options.
[18:04:09] <scott_gonzalez> 1) Create a new account.
[18:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> 2) Go into the database and update all rows with your username :-P
[18:04:45] <kborchers> i'll take #3, just leave it as it is :)
[18:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
