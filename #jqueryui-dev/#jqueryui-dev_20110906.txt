[09:26:51] <byuva> Quick question on jquery Grid.  Looks like it is coming along well but was wondering about the status of documentation.  I am unfortunately not proficient enough really work directly from Github source and wasn't able to track down a documentation timeline on the wiki.
[09:27:38] <jzaefferer> byuva: docs aren't really our focus, as the grid itself won't land before 2.1
[09:27:49] <jzaefferer> but there are specifications for most of the components
[09:28:07] <jzaefferer> e.g. here for the datasource for sorting/paging/filtering: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Grid-SPF
[09:28:14] <jzaefferer> that should help if you also look at the demos
[09:28:27] <jzaefferer> otherwise, just ask here for specifics
[09:31:57] <byuva> thanks jzaefferer.   I was looking for demos within the demo directory on Github.  This page seems to be just what I needed.
[09:35:29] <byuva> So if we are on jquery 1.8 that implies 2.1 is a ways off I am guessing :-)  Any rough order of magnitude estimates of ETA (6 months, 1 year, 2 years+)?
[09:47:53] <jzaefferer> well, once 1.9 is done, 2.0 and 2.1 should land a lot faster
[09:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9 is months away, but hopefully 2.0 will be faster than 1.9
[09:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> and 2.1 can be extremely fast
[09:51:33] <byuva> ok, so perhaps sometime next spring?

[10:01:16] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tabs: Find panels using aria-controls instead of index for remove method. Fixes #7698 - Panels do not sort when a tab is sorted which can cause a mismatch error when a tab is removed. - Scott González
[11:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> can anyone think of an example of a modeless dialog in OS X?
[12:02:49] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: modeless == opposite of modal?
[12:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:10:30] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i swear i've seen a progress bar or something at some point that was modeless but i can't remember for sure and i'm on win7 at work
[13:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> who wants to see a super crazy bug?
[13:18:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'll bite
[13:24:35] <jzaefferer> give it to him!
[13:24:36] <scott_gonzalez> check out http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7577
[13:24:40] <jzaefferer> its really fun
[13:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> reproduce that test case locally
[13:25:12] <scott_gonzalez> then comment out line 326 in jquery.ui.dialog.js
[13:49:02] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that is super weird!!
[13:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, no idea what's going on with that
[13:51:44] <scott_gonzalez> or what a legit workaround would be
[13:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> or WTF is up with Opera
[13:52:00] <kborchers> good 'ol opera
[14:14:12] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: check this out ... if you clear the input values from the close event handler of the dialog, it works correctly in Opera http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/he6aQ/2/
[14:14:57] <scott_gonzalez> interesting
[14:22:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: well, i'm officially intrigued and thus did not finish what i was working on before the end of the day. oh well.
[14:22:41] <kborchers> let me know if you figure it out ... otherwise i will keep looking later tonight
[14:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> heh, I don't think anyone will ever figure it out :-P
[14:23:51] <kborchers> i'll take that as a challenge ;)
[15:47:42] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #14: STILL FAILING in 56 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/14/
[15:53:16] <jzaefferer> woooo, its jq-jenkins \o/
[15:53:27] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: saw that? :-)
[15:53:50] <jzaefferer> its now also using the right git commit
[15:53:53] <scott_gonzalez> heh, nice
[15:54:08] <jzaefferer> so it actually tests the revision its supposed to test, not just latest...
[15:54:21] <scott_gonzalez> can we get that page to link to the test results?
[15:54:24] <jzaefferer> had to add resolving enviroment variables...
[15:54:34] <jzaefferer> probably
[15:54:50] <jzaefferer> I'm still very new to Jenkins plugin development :-)
[15:55:11] <jzaefferer> I need a better development enviroment still, was testing but deploying an update to the plugin to that instance, then restarting it
[15:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> kids are home, time to head downstairs
[15:56:19] <scott_gonzalez> later
[15:56:23] <jzaefferer> yeah, time to sleep
[15:56:25] <jzaefferer> see you
