[09:44:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: how do I get a changelog between m6 and m7? Just something to look through for major changes
[09:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> git whatchanged 1.9m6..
[09:46:26] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:46:34] <jzaefferer> also, we once had a release checklist for milestones
[09:46:40] <scott_gonzalez> git log will work too.
[09:46:40] <jzaefferer> any idea where that might be?
[09:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> search the planning wiki for build checklist
[09:51:39] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/tZBy1Q

[09:51:39] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Bump version - Jörn Zaefferer
[09:52:55] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #298: STILL FAILING in 58 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/298/
[09:52:55] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Tagging 1.9m7
[09:52:56] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Bump version
[09:53:49] <jzaefferer> oh, I missed the ".." after the tag
[09:53:50] <jzaefferer> doh
[09:54:18] <scott_gonzalez> The .. is just to get the log.
[09:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9m6.. = everything since 1.9m6
[09:54:30] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:54:36] <jzaefferer> I need one liners :/
[09:55:11] <jzaefferer> Its been 7 months since m6
[09:55:18] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[09:56:24] <jzaefferer> There's so much, even with just one line per commit...
[09:56:45] <jzaefferer> 7 full pages
[10:13:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: had to reupload the zip file - turned out the ant build produces one with the right child folder, but then it also contains a jqueryuimin.js and a themes folder in the root
[10:13:37] <jzaefferer> cleaned that up manually - looks like we won't use it ever again anyway
[10:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:17:24] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can you verify this? http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui/downloads/detail?name=jquery-ui-1.9m7.zip&can=2&q=#makechanges
[10:17:36] <jzaefferer> I've uploaded a new zip, but still getting the old crap
[10:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/2228383
[10:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> what's resource_loader.js?
[10:21:09] <jzaefferer> well, so it was a cache issue
[10:21:44] <jzaefferer> isn't that what you introduced to manage files in units?
[10:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> Did we lose the kz i18n file?
[10:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> heh, I guess so :-P I forgot about that.
[10:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> That looks good, minus the kz i18n file disappearing.
[10:23:52] <jzaefferer> f11dab3 - Datepicker: Changed Kazakh locale from kz to kk. Fixes #7829 - Kazakhstan language code. (5 months ago) <Scott González>
[10:24:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, just found that too.
[10:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> So this looks good.
[10:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> I need to write a script that does tree diffs.
[10:25:16] <jzaefferer> yeah, do that
[10:25:25] <jzaefferer> after you take a look at the blog post draft: http://blog.jqueryui.com/?p=960&preview=true
[10:25:46] <jzaefferer> I've verified all links...
[10:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's the seventh, not sixth :-)
[10:31:04] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, looks like you just didn't touch the opening paragraph.
[10:31:42] <scott_gonzalez> other markup then... then => than
[10:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> Other than that it looks good.
[10:35:02] <jzaefferer> Updated
[10:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good.
[10:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> PUBLISH!
[10:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: grunt-css doesn't require node ~0.6.11.
[10:52:02] <scott_gonzalez> I will hate you if I need to upgrade node right now :-P
[10:52:26] <jzaefferer> yeah, I just kept the value generated by `grunt init:node`
[10:52:38] <jzaefferer> I can change that and put out 0.1.1 if it helps
[10:53:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, please.
[10:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to use a tilde version, ~0.6.
[10:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> But probably >=0.6 is fine.
[10:54:27] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know what it's actually doing, but I wouldn't be surprised if >=0.4 or even * was correct :-)
[10:58:31] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: pull and npm-install, should be working now
[10:58:33] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to grunt: http://git.io/38BQyg
[10:58:33] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grunt] Build/grunt: Accept more grunt-css versions - Jörn Zaefferer
[11:04:12] <gnarf> sorry about the lack of meeting attendance/work coming from me this month - I've been putting in really long hours at work (and still not waking up in time for meetings)
[11:04:42] <gnarf> should be back into a better rotation in april
[12:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We still need docs for 1-8-stable
[13:56:07] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: true, to no grunt for 1.8?
[13:56:25] <jzaefferer> also, did you check the release and release_theme outputs?
[14:41:55] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: just looked at adm-zip again - now its not writing the while at all anymore. The code quality is not really getting better, its not even trying to stream things...
[18:15:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yo
[18:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: what's up?
[18:21:58] <kborchers> hey just wondering if you were submitting a talk for strangeloop this year ... i'm trying to come up with something in the next couple of days before the deadline
[18:22:18] <kborchers> and i saw you spoke last year
[18:23:17] <kborchers> just curious :)
[18:23:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to, haven't thought about what to present yet.

[18:23:35] <kborchers> heh, so same boat

[18:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> The March deadline is for workshops.
[18:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> The call for speakers hasn't started yet.
[18:24:05] <kborchers> orly?
[18:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> Really :-)
[18:24:17] <scott_gonzalez> You've got time.
[18:24:26] * kborchers breaths a sigh of relief
[18:24:55] <kborchers> i thought i had read it a while back and had plenty of time
[18:25:03] <kborchers> then looked today and was like OH CRAP!
[18:25:17] * kborchers needs to read more carefuly
[18:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:26:21] <kborchers> i'm planning on submitting to this one too http://thatconference.com/
[18:26:31] <kborchers> it's at a giant indoor water park
[18:26:42] <kborchers> and only a few hours from home so i could take the family :)
[18:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> That's awesome.
