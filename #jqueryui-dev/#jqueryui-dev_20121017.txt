[00:09:52] <datadl> Hi everybody!
[00:11:38] <datadl> I have been trying everything before coming to this channel. I am facing a problem with the jqueryui sortable plugin. When dragging the first item of the list, the holder never shows up and when inspecting the code I can see that the html element is here but with style="display: none". I can't find anything about it on forums neither on google. For info, I am on jqueryui 1.9.0, jquery 1.8.2 and I am using 2 sortables list with the
[00:11:54] <datadl> If anybody can help that would be fantastic!!
[00:22:20] <datadl> this is funny, when explaining a problem to people, you sometimes find the solution while writing ... !!
[00:22:45] <datadl> The whole problem was that in the start method I was forcing the style of my holder with the following code:
[00:22:52] <datadl> ui.placeholder.attr('style', containerItems.find('li').attr('style'));
[00:23:25] <datadl> so when dragging the first item it would apply the display none style that jqueryui applies to it.
[00:23:38] <datadl> the solution is to write instead: ui.placeholder.attr('style', containerItems.find('li:not(.holder)').not(ui.item).attr('style'));
[00:23:46] <datadl> hope this can help someone!!

[12:58:17] <nacin> jzaefferer: hey. yeah, scott_gonzalez put that on my radar. it is an nginx rule. if gnarf has time, it would be great if he can get to it first.

[13:01:22] <nacin> jzaefferer: hah, okay. about to run a weekly meeting, will look tonight.
[13:01:52] <jzaefferer> okay, maybe I can get gnarf to fix it before that
