[03:46:40] <Omar-> arschmitz: good morning
[07:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Is http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137778/Datepicker#commentnum1371828720 still relevant now that we'll have separate calendar and datepicker widgets?

[08:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> Or did you just debug on his site?

[08:35:36] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: That ticket is voodoo.
[08:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[08:35:49] <tj_vantoll> I can only recreate it in jsFiddle, in the iframe.
[08:35:54] <tj_vantoll> In Firefox.
[08:36:33] <tj_vantoll> In local demos, the bug does occur. If I use an <iframe> to the same jsFiddle locally, the bug doesn't occur.

[08:37:52] <doesallmagic2> Scott Gonz√°lez: Dialog: Fix stacking of modal dialog overlays
[08:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[08:39:39] <scott_gonzalez> So if I just copy the fiddle code into a local demo it should fail?
[08:40:30] <tj_vantoll> No that's the thing.
[08:40:43] <tj_vantoll> I tried to do that and I couldn't get it to happen locally at all, even with the same code.
[08:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, was "In local demos, the bug does occur." supposed to say "doesn't"?
[08:41:25] <tj_vantoll> yeah.
[08:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:41:31] <tj_vantoll> oops o_O
[08:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I thought from the ticket comment.
[08:41:42] <scott_gonzalez> Well, this should be fun...
[08:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to recreate the full jsFiddle environment locally.
[08:42:05] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully that will work.
[08:43:36] <tj_vantoll> I might've been doing some silly, so it's worth verifying what I found.

[08:54:46] <scott_gonzalez> Woohoo. Second PR from IBM.
[09:07:04] <scott_gonzalez> huh, accordion doesn't handle changes to `heightStyle`.
[09:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> Even with an explicit refresh.
[09:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> How did that get overlooked?!?
[09:25:21] <agcolom> arschmitz: jasperdegroot gseguin|away gabriel_schulhof it's my daughter's birthday today, so I won't be able to attend the meeting I think (as it's at dinner time here).
[09:25:34] <arschmitz> agcolom: no problem
[09:25:38] <agcolom> thanks. 
[09:26:04] <agcolom> I've updated the docs to 1.4.3 and scott_gonzalez had to do a manual deploy. 
[09:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: You need to register to be op.
[09:26:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: my nick is registered
[09:26:55] <agcolom> I've spotted some stuff in the code examples that need tidying up, so I'll start on that tomorrow and will also do the meeting minutes.
[09:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: You need to identify though.
[09:27:19] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: also i was not trying to unmute now meeting is not until 2
[09:27:59] <arschmitz> oh right i restarted and i dont have it set to auto identify
[09:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: You can op yourself with /cs op #jquery-meeting
[09:29:47] <arschmitz> i tried before and it said i didnt have the rights let me try again
[09:30:09] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah not authorized
[09:30:24] <arschmitz> i am in here just not in meeting
[09:30:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's just because you weren't identified.
[09:31:05] <arschmitz> no i still cant
[09:31:21] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: see i oped in here it wont let me in meeting
[09:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[09:31:46] <arschmitz> i know i was given rights in here a long time back 
[09:31:49] <scott_gonzalez> "Notice from ChanServ: Channel arschmitz is not registered."
[09:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:32:02] <arschmitz> huh?
[09:32:19] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to op you as a channel instead of giving you op permissions.
[09:32:26] <arschmitz> ohhh right
[09:32:34] <arschmitz> i was confused for a sec lol
[09:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, you're op now.
[09:35:08] <arschmitz> thanks
[09:36:52] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: as far as calendar vs date-picker and inline for mobile 
[09:38:11] <arschmitz> it does not "fix" the problem however its not a problem because there is no inline option any more lol 
[09:39:32] <arschmitz> well it never was an option
[09:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> So Mobile can choose to solve this with an inlineDatepicker widget that does the wiring for you, right?
[09:39:38] <arschmitz> but its handled differently
[09:39:43] <arschmitz> right
[09:39:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so I'll remove that comment.
[09:40:06] <arschmitz> basicly the new way does not fix it but it makes it very different so its not applicable any more
[09:40:21] <arschmitz> so yeah delete the comment
[09:44:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so i want to talk to you about ui and mobile select menu when you have a minute
[09:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:57:19] <Omar-> arschmitz: hi again
[09:59:04] <Omar-> anyone?
[09:59:12] <Omar-> jQM team
[09:59:31] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof jasperdegroot
[10:01:25] <arschmitz> Omar-: hi
[10:07:12] <Omar-> arschmitz: Hi
[10:07:42] <arschmitz> Omar-: whats up?
[10:07:50] <Omar-> a quick question, what's the difference between `$.mobile.navigate()` and `.pagecontainer("change")`?
[10:08:33] <Omar-> both do the same job and accept same arguments (options)
[10:11:15] <arschmitz> Omar-: i suggest you read the api documentation for them
[10:45:35] <gseguin> arschmitz, jasperdegroot: I won't make the meeting today, sorry
[10:51:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok no problem
[10:54:30] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: cgack told me he is on vacation this week so he won't be able to join the meeting either
[10:54:45] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok
[11:00:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Are we meeting?
[11:04:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[11:04:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: trying to remember how to change the mode lol
[11:05:27] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz:  / mode #jquery-meeting -m
[11:05:34] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: without the space after /
[11:06:57] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: You can use /say /something to say something that starts with a /
[11:07:03] <Omar-> arschmitz: I did read API, I'm still in doubt.
[11:07:06] <gabriel_schulhof> /mode #jquery-meeting -m
[11:07:26] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: ah ok, thanks
[11:07:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: tl;dr don't use $.mobile.navigate(). Use .pagecontainer( "change" )
[11:07:59] <arschmitz> Omar-: for support questions you should use #jquery
[11:08:06] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[11:08:29] <arschmitz> Omar-: this channel is only for dev work on the libraries
[11:08:40] <Omar-> arschmitz: jQM experienced ones are rare
[11:08:53] <Omar-> my bad, sorry!
