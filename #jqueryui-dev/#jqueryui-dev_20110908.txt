[13:01:47] <networkuser> Hi
[13:01:56] <networkuser> I have a problem with Dialog
[13:02:13] <networkuser> when I go a page which has vertical scroll
[13:02:28] <networkuser> then on other pages which dont have scroll
[13:02:40] <networkuser> when I open dialog I see scrollbar
[13:47:23] <networkuser> it seems in the first modal it cache the height,... so in other pages it is using previous cached modal
