[05:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: This dialog focus bug is crazy.
[05:48:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9332
[05:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> document.activeElement is actually incorrect.
[05:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> document.activeElement is whatever element we tried to focus in the dialog.
[05:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> But focus is actually in the input outside of the dialog.
[05:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!?
[05:49:47] <tj_vantoll> Oh wow.
[05:50:46] <tj_vantoll> That's crazy but does it matter for the purposes of the bug?
[05:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, because _keepFocus() thinks that the dialog has focus.
[05:51:23] <scott_gonzalez> So we set focus to the dialog.
[05:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> Then IE sets async focus to the input the user clicked on.
[05:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> Then we check if the dialog has focus.
[05:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> IE lies and says it does.
[05:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> So we don't do anything.
[05:52:00] <tj_vantoll> sigh
[05:52:31] <scott_gonzalez> I've been working on this since yesterday. I can't get a combination that passes the tests and keeps focus in the dialog.
[05:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> If we want to fix this, we might have to completely give up sync focus.
[05:53:14] <tj_vantoll> Just a setTimeout in _focusTabbable directly?
[05:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be a timeout inside open().
[05:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> To call _focusTabbable() with a delay.
[05:54:39] <tj_vantoll> Ah yeah.
[05:55:01] <tj_vantoll> I don't think that's so horrible though.
[05:56:48] <tj_vantoll> IE9 also has this fun one where simply accessing document.activeElement throws an error http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8443
[05:57:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's next on my list.
[05:57:12] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for tracking down the core workaround.
[05:57:57] <tj_vantoll> np, actually just caught that by chance when looking at their changelog.
[06:31:25] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: do you have something to push for jQuery UI? Migration of the jQuery UI Jenkins job, just need to check if the commit hook is working
[06:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, in the middle of this dialog focus crap.
[06:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see if there's something I can do real quick.

[06:54:34] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, TODO: handle 1.10.0
[06:54:50] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what does that mean?
[06:54:56] <rxaviers> It seems we are unable yet to guess what the previous version was whenever we have a patch = 0
[06:55:04] <rxaviers> (on release script)
[06:55:19] <rxaviers> any suggestion?
[06:55:20] <scott_gonzalez> That's correct.
[06:56:03] <scott_gonzalez> I can fix it. It was just never important enough.
[06:56:06] <rxaviers> List tags and get the upper previous one..
[06:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:56:23] <scott_gonzalez> We don't even need a dependency on node-semver.
[06:56:43] <scott_gonzalez> Because we can just figure out the previous major + minor, search for those, and compare the results.
[06:57:26] <rxaviers> ok, I will fix work on that then.. we're almost done with "release import"
[06:57:37] <rxaviers> it's building the cdn or pre packages using DB
[06:58:05] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You can use `git for-each-ref refs/tags/1.9*` to get just the tags we care about.
[06:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> Where 1.9 = major + minor parsed from the version info we have.
[06:58:30] <rxaviers> ah! that's good to know. Didnt know that
[06:58:37] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, is that true? We always do a pre when updating a patch. We always do a CDN when updating a minor (or major)
[06:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> No.
[06:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> CDN = all stable releases.
[07:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> We don't do pre-releases for patch updates.
[07:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, when we get to 2.0.0, we're going to follow semver for real.
[07:01:36] <rxaviers> cool!
[07:32:07] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I will use this
[07:32:22] <rxaviers> git for-each-ref --sort=-authordate --count=1 refs/tags/<major>.<minor>*
[07:33:07] <rxaviers> it seems to work well for 1.8, 1.9, 1.10
[07:33:20] <rxaviers> if you find it wrong, just let me know
[07:33:24] <rxaviers> plz
[08:04:37] <scott_gonzalez> That should work.
[08:35:26] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I just updated the GitHub commit hook for download.jqueryui.com, so new commits should all go to http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/download.jqueryui.com/
[08:36:06] <rxaviers> do we still get IRC notifications when they pass or fail?
[08:40:28] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: yeah, from doesallmagic2
[08:40:46] <rxaviers> cool, ok thks for letting me know

[11:26:34] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, guys, Release script into DB! :)
[11:27:14] <rxaviers> I've made some dry-runs and it seems ok. But, of course, needs more eyes to make sure it's bug proof.
[11:27:46] <rxaviers> related PR: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/139
[11:29:15] <rxaviers> and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/951
[12:02:30] <rxaviers> it's a totally independent file, while it depends on DB now
[12:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> It dependend on DB before too.
[12:03:43] <rxaviers> let's say it's more dependent now
[12:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> Unless I'm missing something, the release script itself shouldn't have changed much.
[12:03:50] <rxaviers> previous jquery-ui grunt task did the zipping, the md5sum. Now, it's done by DB (zip), or the script itself (md5)
[12:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> None of that was inside the release script anyway.
[12:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> It was all in grunt.
[12:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> Which is what this whole process was about.
[12:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> Moving things out of grunt.
[12:05:29] <rxaviers> that's why I said it's slightly more dependent on DB then it was before.
[12:06:12] <rxaviers> I also made some other changes, like support guessing prevVersion when patch is zero (that we just talked)
[12:06:12] <rxaviers> that we will need for 1.11
[12:16:31] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, release script is not using jquery-ui grunt anymore

[12:16:43] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI Selectmenu build #116: STILL FAILING in 15 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20Selectmenu/116/
[12:16:44] <doesallmagic2> info: Selectmenu tests: fix lint issues
[12:17:01] <rxaviers> other than moving it back to jquery-ui then and re-splitting the changelog-shell (template file). anything else/
[12:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Not at all? not even `grunt authors` or `grunt manifest`?
[12:17:40] <rxaviers> grunt manifest?
[12:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> The task that generates manifest files.
[12:18:25] <rxaviers> yeah, I know.
[12:18:54] <rxaviers> ok. I just didnt remember we talking about moving the manifests too
[12:18:54] <rxaviers> neither authors
[12:18:55] <rxaviers> we talked about release and release_cdn
[12:19:02] <rxaviers> but, no problem. I will work on moving those too
[12:19:03] <rxaviers> So
[12:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> Don't move them.
[12:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> They belong in jquery-ui.
[12:19:26] <rxaviers> grunt authors is completely used in the release script. AFAIK
[12:19:41] <rxaviers> why you want the release script not to use them?
[12:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> You're very much misunderstanding me.
[12:19:56] <scott_gonzalez> You said "release script is not using jquery-ui grunt anymore"
[12:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> And I was shocked.
[12:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> I asked about two specific uses that have to stay.
[12:21:28] <rxaviers> ok then, so it's ok that release script uses grunt manifest and grunt authors and that stays this way.
[12:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[12:21:48] <rxaviers> other than moving release script back to jquery-ui, and re-splitting the changelog-shell (template file). anything else/
[12:22:20] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't looked at the PR yet.
[12:22:32] <rxaviers> ok
[12:22:48] <rxaviers> just let me know and I work on those, so we close this book
[12:23:23] <rxaviers> (turn this page :P)
[12:27:19] <rxaviers> btw. yeap, in a hurry I didnt noticed the question marks. I thought you were stating that it shouldnt use grunt at all. srry
[13:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's BSD, so we shouldn't have any licensing issues.
[13:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> And they have a CLA.
[13:32:32] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so what do you think is the next step? rework interaction to work with polymer? move on to something else?
[13:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, do you want to put together a PR like the one you had before?
[13:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> But using Polymer instead of special events.
[13:32:34] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yep, i can do that
[13:32:34] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:32:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm so glad we're not going to have to build this ourselves.
[13:32:34] <kborchers> i haven't dug too deep into polymer
[13:32:34] <scott_gonzalez> This was going to be so much more complicated than it seemed because of touch-action and event.preventDefault().
[13:32:35] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah ‚Ä¶ i dumped a lot of time into it though :/
[13:32:35] <kborchers> i guess better to cut and run now though instead of a couple months from now
[13:32:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, well, that part sucks. But we knew this might happen. Also, now you've got more in-depth knowledge of the problems we need to solve.
[13:32:36] <kborchers> that is true
[13:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pointer-events/2013AprJun/0182.html
[13:32:58] <kborchers> i should hopefully be able to put together a new PR tonight i think
