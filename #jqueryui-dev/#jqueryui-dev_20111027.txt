[08:20:44] <gnarf> damn rworth thats like a an essa

[08:48:51] <gnarf> jzaefferer: making the culture an option actually gave me an opprotunity to clean up
[08:49:02] <gnarf> jzaefferer: do you like the new name of rsignleh ? :)
[08:54:30] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: this is looking much better: http://view.jqueryui.com/editable/demos/editable/buttons.html
[08:54:45] <jzaefferer> first thing I noticed there: the input should fill
[08:55:00] <jzaefferer> in the worst case, no buttons, there's a lot of whitespace within the border
[08:55:15] <jzaefferer> either it matches the input width or the input fills it
[08:55:42] <jzaefferer> but yeah, looks great :-)
[08:55:54] <jzaefferer> gnarf: looking at mask commits now
[08:56:18] <jzaefferer> that is, mask branch
[08:56:31] * gnarf nods
[08:57:21] <jzaefferer> formatNonPaddedHours
[08:57:25] <jzaefferer> that works
[08:57:39] <jzaefferer> less confusing then rsignleh
[08:57:49] <gnarf> :)
[08:57:54] <jzaefferer> it actually was rsingleh
[08:58:01] <jzaefferer> rsignleh is really confusing :p
[08:58:15] * gnarf nods
[08:59:08] <jzaefferer> still works without Globalize, right?
[08:59:20] <jzaefferer> so yeah, looks good
[09:02:21] <gnarf> that value function feels really giant too
[09:02:26] <gnarf> but i can't think of a better way to do it
[09:18:06] <gnarf> wb jzaefferer
[09:28:46] <gnarf> did i have my time wrong for that observable meeting?
[09:47:13] <jzaefferer> x
[09:47:45] <jzaefferer> gnarf: IS IT ME?
[10:48:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, well osberved (Im talking about the no buttons case of input fill)
[10:48:17] <rxaviers> I will try to get it better made
[10:49:51] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: its not just on no buttons, seeing that (in Chrome/OSX) on all of them
[10:50:48] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, wait... that padding (0.4em) is to respect the button default dimensions
[10:51:10] <rxaviers> otherwise, the buttons doesn't fit (or we reduce the button)
[10:52:47] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: http://bassistance.de/i/5af2da.png
[10:54:37] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, from that blue border to the gray border there's a 0.4em margin, which is the same as the buttons' padding (from the icon to its edge)
[10:55:12] <jzaefferer> I'm talking about the big gap between the right side of the blue outline and the buttons
[10:55:17] <jzaefferer> that's a lot more then 0.4em
[10:56:05] <jzaefferer> even with the text buttons there's still a gap
[11:02:40] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ah! LOL.. so, no big deal... I will explain..
[11:02:59] <jzaefferer> just fix it ;)
[11:03:21] <rxaviers> wait
[11:03:34] <rxaviers> it's not a widget problem, it's why I made it that way in the demo
[11:04:29] <rxaviers> In the button widget, I made the editable span to be display:block, so we could align every editable's to compare how button looks
[11:04:34] <rxaviers> ops
[11:04:40] <rxaviers> In the button demo*, I made the editable span to be display:block, so we could align every editable's to compare how button looks
[11:05:09] <jzaefferer> okay
[11:05:19] <jzaefferer> can you adjust it to make it look less, well, bad?
[11:05:37] <jzaefferer> also, I still get content jumping around when hovering the editable here: http://view.jqueryui.com/editable/demos/editable/default.html
[11:05:51] <rxaviers> So, in the demo I should also add another style to make the input occupy all the space, I think making input display:block would do it too.
[11:06:21] <jzaefferer> okay
[11:06:35] <rxaviers> sure
[11:06:44] <rxaviers> and thanks for pointing that
[11:13:03] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, found only one way to solve this using css... Instead of using float:right for the buttons, we would need to use display:table-cell on the inner elements (input and buttons)
[11:13:09] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, what do u think?
[11:13:43] <rxaviers> even thought we may have cross browser compat.. mm
[11:13:45] <rxaviers> any idea?
[11:21:17] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to interactions: http://git.io/huhH9g
[11:21:17] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/interactions] Draggable: Add ui-draggable class. - Scott González
[11:25:17] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: not sure; if it's just a demo issue, just make it work
[11:26:52] <gnarf> rxaviers: i might see if you can corner toddparker / filament group guys about the CSS - see if they have some magic bullet to expand the input area
[11:34:38] <gnarf> maybe see if there are any css wizards hiding in mobile-dev :)
[11:35:46] <scott_gonzalez> any objection to closing this as wontfix? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6655
[11:37:05] <gnarf> hrm
[11:37:49] <gnarf> thats a bit crazy don't you think?
[11:38:01] <gnarf> maybe even patcheswelcome it
[11:38:11] <gnarf> if something can be done about it that isn't huge and fugly
[11:38:31] <gnarf> I'm using iframes as tooltips
[11:38:50] <gnarf> but like i don't expect jQuery to reach into my iframe and position something
[11:38:57] <kborchers> i would agree that is a little crazy
[11:39:15] <scott_gonzalez> well, you need to know the entire path
[11:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> can you even get that from inside the iframe?
[11:39:32] <gnarf> nope
[11:39:38] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, so it's impossible then
[11:39:58] <gnarf> i don't even think there is a good way to get at the iframe from within the html inside it
[11:40:10] <gnarf> i mean the actual <iframe> dom element from the parent doc
[11:40:19] <scott_gonzalez> right
[11:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> if you could do that, then you could walk up the whole way
[11:43:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: did you see the effects ticket that just came in?
[11:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure you fixed that bug, but using jquery-ui-git the bounce effect doesn't even work
[11:43:43] <gnarf> wha?
[11:44:10] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/effects/effects.all.html
[11:44:13] <gnarf> bounces...
[11:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7816
[11:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> I took the fiddle in that ticket and change to jquery-ui-git.js
[11:45:45] <scott_gonzalez> it just faded out instead of bouncing out
[11:45:55] <gnarf> wtf
[11:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> weird, now it's bouncing
[11:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> but it's bouncing totally differently than with 1.8.16
[11:47:45] <gnarf> im still having not bouncing issues
[11:48:14] <rxaviers> gnarf, thanks for the tips
[11:48:42] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Im thinking this auto-fill css adjustment will also be useful when using it in tables
[11:48:58] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...so you're seeing it fade out?
[11:49:59] <gnarf> something strange happening here
[11:50:35] <gnarf> that bug report makes like zero sense tho
[11:51:08] <scott_gonzalez> the bug is that .hide().hide( "effect" ) reshows the element so that it can do the effect
[11:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> you fixed it a while ago
[11:51:19] <gnarf> ah yeah
[11:51:26] <scott_gonzalez> I already closed it as a dup
[12:06:11] <gnarf> somethings up with the bounce effect tho
[12:06:19] <gnarf> i think the defaults changed a bit
[12:06:25] <gnarf> because we made the bounce distance "normalized"
[12:06:42] <gnarf> the new defaults feel much more dramatic
[12:06:43] <gnarf> :)
