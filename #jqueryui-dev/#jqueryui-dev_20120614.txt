[09:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers jzaefferer: Just noticed this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7859
[09:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> I know Hans reviewed menu, but not sure if he looked at these specific items.
[09:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> That was over halfa year ago, so it's possible they were all addressed.
[09:47:18] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: looking
[09:47:24] <kborchers> #1 is not true
[09:47:36] <kborchers> #2 is not true
[09:48:21] <kborchers> #3 is not true
[09:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> Cool. I'll close as fixed.
[09:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:48:56] <kborchers> granted, i don't have JAWS to check if that messes with it but i never saw that without AT and nor with NVDA
[09:49:20] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ^
[09:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I'm assuming it was just an old implementation.
[09:50:11] <scott_gonzalez> He tested 7 months ago.
[09:50:11] <kborchers> yeah
[09:50:18] <scott_gonzalez> I doubt JAWS was changing that stuff.
[09:52:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: P.S. - Plane hacking session got me to the point that I don't think there will be any improvement in the alternate stuff I was thinking about implement
[09:53:15] <gnarf> so - I'm prety sure this is stable after I fix the IE6/7
[09:53:34] <scott_gonzalez> cool

[09:58:03] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by cleonello (8m, 1d ago): Fix for vertical blind effect on positioned elements (ticket #7789)
[09:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> That ticket claims to be against git.
[09:59:22] <gnarf> hrm
[09:59:26] <gnarf> so that seems dangerous
[09:59:49] <scott_gonzalez> Can you confirm whether the bug exists in 1.8.x?
[09:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm only concerned if it's new in 1.9.
[10:00:12] <gnarf> it should exist in 1.8.x
[10:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:00:17] <gnarf> but i will try to confirm real quick...
[10:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, I'm going through all open tickets with a version of git.
[10:00:33] <gnarf> none of the effects really pay attention to elements original positions
[10:00:47] <scott_gonzalez> Right, which should be improved by using clip, correct?
[10:00:57] <gnarf> parially
[10:01:13] <scott_gonzalez> I was smart and said improved, not fixed :-)
[10:01:19] <gnarf> I still need to try to win an argument with vendors about positioning attribs
[10:01:38] <gnarf> some of the effects wont need to adjust positions anymore if we use clip
[10:01:40] <gnarf> some will
[10:02:20] <gnarf> anyway - stole some juice, headed to the next talk - about CSS and rectangles ;)
[10:02:24] <gnarf> bbiab
[10:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> CSS can draw rectangles now?!?
[10:03:14] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it was limited to circles and starts and stuff. :-P

[10:50:49] <scott_gonzalez> GREEN!
[10:51:11] <nacin> Pandora playlist of all the jazz artists we've chosen, including Mr. Green.
[10:51:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to test this out now.
[10:51:49] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[10:51:49] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #528: FIXED in 9 min 2 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/528/
[10:51:50] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Tabs: Fixed event triggering for select method.
[10:52:10] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: it has a way to go, but we finally have a framework I can quickly add to. I have some one-off scripts to incorporate into it.
[10:53:56] <scott_gonzalez> Want to hop on a Skype call and walk through what it does?
[10:55:23] <nacin> I think we need a web-base-template/config.php file, to pull some of the wp-config.php stuff out of puppet.
[10:56:13] <nacin> For now: pull web-base-template into place. Define WP_CONTENT_DIR etc as before. So you have a wp-config.php file, but no DB tables yet.
[10:56:31] <nacin> Then you go to your install in a browser, and it will hijack the install script.
[10:57:11] <nacin> After which it gives you some more constants to toss into wp-config.php (most of which can go into a config.php instead), and you're done — full network installed.
[10:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll try that out.
[11:01:25] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: around? What you did for category.php I also need to apply to index.php, sidebar.php and content.php, right?
[11:08:13] <kswedberg> hi jzaefferer.
[11:08:22] <kswedberg> what stuff in particular?
[11:08:46] <jzaefferer> so you created category-api.php in jquery
[11:09:04] <jzaefferer> and category.php in api.jquery.com is including that via get_template_part
[11:09:17] <jzaefferer> the same needs to happen for other template we want to share across the four api sites, right?
[11:09:28] <kswedberg> oh yeah. right. if we want them all to match, we'll need to do the same for the others. yes.
[11:09:47] <kswedberg> (if we want to keep it DRY)
[11:10:24] <jzaefferer> yes, need to
[11:10:50] <kswedberg> want me to do that? I can do it tonight.
[11:11:16] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: Rewrite rules should now work for plugins.
[11:11:34] <jzaefferer> I've started it
[11:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll test that after I get this install done.
[11:11:52] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: ok, if you want to do it, go for it. :)
[11:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Can you start on the rewrite rules for resources?
[11:11:59] <nacin> yep, almost done.
[11:12:56] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I am going to re-arrange mu-plugins, is that okay?
[11:13:12] <nacin> currently, plugins.jquery.com-posts.php would be included everywhere, when you only want it on the plugins site.
[11:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you can do that. I wasn't sure how to pull that off :-)
[11:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Should I be putting wp-config.php, index.php, .htaccess one level up from wordpress for this install script?
[11:14:44] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yes, that is fine.
[11:14:47] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: (I think)
[11:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> I want to follow the steps that everyone should follow.
[11:15:14] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: I'm not really getting anywhere. I get 404s for posts and category links, so can't really test any change.
[11:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> So if this is designed to be inside wordpress, tha'ts fine.
[11:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> I just want to make sure I do the right thing.
[11:15:37] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: I'm running out of time now, so would appreciate if you could stab it tonight
[11:15:45] <jzaefferer> Will go from there tomorrow
[11:15:50] <kswedberg> ok, will do.
[11:15:57] <jzaefferer> At least once the posts are created properly
[11:15:57] <kswedberg> ↑jzaefferer
[11:16:06] <jzaefferer> Maybe I'll start over with nacin's install script
[11:16:11] <kswedberg> k
[11:16:18] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I think putting it inside /wordpress for testing purposes is okay, but it won't be what we have set up on the servers.
[11:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so where do the files come from for production?
[11:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> Should we just add a directory to web-base-template that has files to copy?
[11:19:54] <nacin> puppet? not sure what you're asking.
[11:21:32] <scott_gonzalez> It seems problematic to me if there are things that can only happen through puppet.
[11:21:55] <nacin> what files are you referring to, though?
[11:22:02] <nacin> I agree with you. Let me see what I can pull out of puppet.
[11:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> If there was a script in web-base-template that put these files in place and puppet used that, that seems better than if these setup tasks are written directly in some puppet repo.
[11:22:21] <scott_gonzalez> Whatever would be one level up from wordpress and web-base-tempalte.
[11:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess .htaccess (though that's only for dev with Apache, right?) and index.php.
[11:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> And the dev would need to manually create wp-config.php with the correct settings.
[11:23:19] <nacin> oh, I see. I will chew on this a bit.
[11:23:26] <scott_gonzalez> So it would makes sense for puppet to contain a task for generating wp-config.php, but generating the other files seems like it should live in web-base-template.
[11:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well, let's finish the resource redirects before getting into this.
[11:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> That's blocking testing, while this script is blocking deployment.
[11:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> So let's get resources working so we can verify sites.
[11:28:22] <nacin> was gnarf working on this at the nginx level, or is that also me?
[11:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> That's also you.
[11:29:26] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to write both Apache and nginx yesterday, but I got distracted with other stuff.
[11:29:27] <nacin> Got it. I have the rules, just making sure, as they also need to go into the puppet config.
[11:30:30] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: The rewrites for plugins doesn't seem to be working for me.
[11:30:42] <scott_gonzalez> Child pages go to the right URL, but I get a 404
[11:30:50] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: head to Settings > Permalinks and just unsure you have Post name selected
[11:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I checked that.
[11:31:33] <nacin> okay, still doesn't work?
[11:31:37] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:33:06] <gnarf> nacin: anything that needs to be in puppet, just keep track of the files and let me know which ones i need to distrib via puppet
[11:33:11] <nacin> temporarily add this to the end of the file: add_action( 'init', 'flush_rewrite_rules' );
[11:33:13] <nacin> gnarf: great
[11:33:22] <gnarf> I can work on the nginx rewrites, but TBH - I could very much use any help you can give there
[11:33:27] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Does it matter if the guids aren't unique?
[11:33:42] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: they should be unique, but no - guids are only for feeds
[11:33:46] <scott_gonzalez> In my DB, I can see that all of my plugin posts have just the domain as the guid
[11:34:00] <gnarf> it'll fuck up an RSS feed of plugins
[11:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure why that's the case.
[11:34:01] <nacin> impressive.
[11:34:38] <nacin> what kind of 404 are you getting?
[11:34:43] <nacin> just a standard theme 404?
[11:35:26] <nacin> you should install the Debug Bar plugin and see what the Request tab says
[11:36:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, standard theme 404: This is embarrasing...
[11:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> I installed debug bar and I'm getting 404s on the debug files :-P
[11:38:44] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/1n2G0i3r00092i1i260x
[11:39:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's throwing the path on disk into the URL :-/
[11:39:54] <nacin> do you have WP_CONTENT_URL defined in wp-config?
[11:40:27] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: What should that be set to?
[11:41:54] <nacin> okay. try doing that, then. define( 'WP_CONTENT_URL', '//wordpress.local/wp-content' );
[11:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't seem to make a difference.
[11:43:20] <nacin> err, sorry.
[11:43:29] <nacin> define( 'WP_CONTENT_URL', '//wordpress.local/web-base-template' );
[11:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> That's not the problem.
[11:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> It's still appending my path from disk to that URL.
[11:47:14] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Looks like it's from plugins_url()
[11:47:33] <nacin> yeah, plugins_url() uses WP_PLUGIN_URL which uses WP_CONTENT_URL.
[11:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> This is the problem: $folder = dirname(plugin_basename($plugin));
[11:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I found the problem.
[11:50:32] <nacin> are you using symlinks?
[11:50:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yup
[11:50:38] <nacin> yeah, okay.
[11:50:44] <nacin> I was going to ask first, but assumed no.
[11:50:48] <nacin> PHP hates symlinks.
[11:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I've got at least 3 WP installs :-P
[11:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> So web-base-template is symlinked across them.
[11:51:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get rid of the symlink.
[11:57:17] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, now I'm getting different results.
[11:57:28] <scott_gonzalez> The link shows up as http://wordpress.local/jquery.foo/0.0.1a4/
[11:57:38] <scott_gonzalez> But when I go there I end up on http://wordpress.local/0.0.1a4/
[11:57:43] <scott_gonzalez> And the page displays correctly.
[11:57:54] <scott_gonzalez> So there's still some incorrect rewriting happening.
[11:58:14] <scott_gonzalez> err...
[11:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe killing the symlink got me out of date.
[11:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> Now the plugin posts aren't working at all :-/
[11:59:43] <scott_gonzalez> And it's definitely loading the new code.
[12:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> I can't tell what's going on.
[12:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting inconsistent results.
[12:00:15] <scott_gonzalez> Sometimes the parent page works, sometimes it doesn't.
[12:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> Let me delete the posts and recreate them.
[12:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> Child pages are still returning 404s
[12:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> And the guids are still just the domain.
[12:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> We can figure out the guid problem later, as it shouldn't be affecting anything right now.
[12:17:28] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: can you confirm that child pages and their parents are post_type 'jquery_plugin' and post_status 'publish'?
[12:20:32] <scott_gonzalez> confirmed
[12:29:06] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: re-tested everything here, and it all seems to work fine.
[12:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[12:29:54] <nacin> in a few minutes, screenshare?
[12:38:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, let me just finish this call.
[12:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Ready when you are.
[12:42:54] <nacin> cool. rewrites are done for nginx on jq01.stage. just gonna drop in some .htaccess rules, give me a few.
[12:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: No jQuery UI dialog for plugin install confirmation?
[12:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> Re-installing debug bar now to see if that helps.
[12:43:39] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: sigh, you referring to our codependence on thickbox?
[12:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, it's just a plain old confirm()
[12:44:07] <nacin> ah, if you click "Install Now" directly.
[12:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:44:17] <nacin> we could use a patch to kill our remaining AYS confirm() dialogs.
[12:44:34] <nacin> Very few of them at this point; we got rid of most of them when we introduced trash/undo for most objects.
[12:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> Harass me about it after we release 1.9 :-)
[12:44:47] <nacin> :)
[12:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/3W2d2Y2h3Z0p130E0p32
[12:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> So what we''ve been doing is the post name is just "0.0.1a4"
[12:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> I assume that's the difference.
[12:47:46] <nacin> nope, that is proper. I will test with dots in the slugs, but shouldn't make any difference.
[12:47:56] <nacin> what does the query tab look like?
[12:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> I only see request and object cache.
[12:48:58] <nacin> add define( 'SAVEQUERIES', true ); to wp-config.php

[13:49:04] <rworth> you haven't followed all the steps in the readme
[13:49:23] <rworth> specifically, I'm guessing you don't have pygments installed (/pygmentize in your path)

[17:21:57] <clarkbox> hey jzaefferer - do we measure test coverage?
[17:25:12] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: No, but we have the ability to.
[17:36:28] <clarkbox> using?
[17:36:48] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez ^
[17:37:28] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: I think jscoverage.
[17:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and kborchers recently measured test coverage.
[17:38:14] <clarkbox> ok. just wondering. we are looking at coverage analysis tools here at the day job. JScoverage is really only thing that we have come across. and I'm not sure its still maintained?
[17:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure, you'll get better responses when jzaefferer is around :-P
[17:38:56] <scott_gonzalez> I just saw the results via a screenshare.
[17:39:08] <kborchers> clarkbox: that is what i used to measure coverage. it does seem like it's nolonger maintained but it also seemed to work well :)
[17:39:32] <clarkbox> ya. that was my thought. its not maintained because it works.
[17:39:40] <kborchers> yep
[17:39:51] <clarkbox> ok thanks for the info guys.
[17:39:56] <kborchers> np

[17:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[17:43:22] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea :-(
[17:43:24] <kborchers> i love how github puts an LOL in the link for me too
[17:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[17:44:03] <scott_gonzalez> I was on a bit of a $.browser rampage.
[17:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't understand it, so it went away :-P
[17:44:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i almost did that when i was looking at them but felt like i didn't have enough "authority" to just make that call :)
[17:44:51] <scott_gonzalez> Most of what's left is IE6, which we'll drop for 1.10 anyway.
[17:45:14] <kborchers> also, all of the tests were all messed up at the time so i could fully test when i removed something
[17:45:22] <kborchers> s/could/couldn't
[17:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> So, that check in resizable was...umm...ridiculous.
[17:45:34] <kborchers> yeah
[17:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> Let's analyze this:
[17:45:45] <scott_gonzalez> !(!($(element).is(':hidden') || $(element).parents(':hidden').length))
[17:45:49] <scott_gonzalez> !(!(a || b))
[17:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[17:45:52] <kborchers> right
[17:45:58] <scott_gonzalez> element is hidden or a parnet is hidden
[17:45:59] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[17:46:39] <scott_gonzalez> also, element is a jQuery object
[17:46:43] <kborchers> i have no idea
[17:46:50] * kborchers hopes that wasn't me :)
[17:47:00] <scott_gonzalez> No, this is way before your time :-)
[17:47:11] <scott_gonzalez> That whole method is crazy.
[17:47:12] <kborchers> ok :)
[17:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> It iterates over an array of elements.
[17:47:30] <scott_gonzalez> Except that the array is ALWAYS at most 1 element.
[17:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> AND the elements aren't even elements, they're jQuery objects.
[17:47:57] <kborchers> wow
[17:48:04] <kborchers> i can't stop laughing right now
[17:48:27] <scott_gonzalez> It's one of those things where you're looking at it and thinking "I must be missing something."
[17:48:51] <scott_gonzalez> But then Kristin came and bought me a MBP :-D
[17:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if I'll have time to set it up before the conf :-/
[17:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna try.
[17:49:46] <kborchers> WOW!
[17:49:52] <kborchers> new 13"
[17:49:58] <kborchers> or 15
[17:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> 13"
[17:52:57] <kborchers> nice
[17:53:05] <scott_gonzalez> The 2.9Ghz i7 with 8GB RAM :-)
[17:53:10] <kborchers> very nice
[17:53:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I've gota  2.4GHz i5 with 4GB RAM, so it'll be a nice upgrade.
[17:54:47] <scott_gonzalez> And I think I just realized that I unnecesarily bought a VGA adapter.
[17:55:09] <scott_gonzalez> I think my existing one will work.
[17:55:18] <kborchers> i have the 15" with the 2.8 GHz i7 with 8GB so very similar ... i forget what my 17" has since i practically never use it now
[17:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> I can't imagine using a 17" laptop.
[17:56:04] <kborchers> it sits on a desk most of the time
[17:56:35] <kborchers> it's our family computer now so pretty much doesn't move
[17:58:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so after i build a site with grunt (api.jquery.com for example), what do i do to push it to my local wordpress?
[17:58:30] <scott_gonzalez> grunt wordpress-deploy
[17:58:41] <kborchers> ah, thanks
[18:00:35] <kborchers> grunt burns my lap :)
[18:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[18:01:53] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez created fade (+1 new commit): http://git.io/w2iRxQ
[18:01:53] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/fade] Effects (fade): Delegate hiding and showing to core. Fixes #8267 - dialog fadein broken since 1.9m4. - Scott González
[18:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'm a bit worried about that with upgrading to an i7.
[18:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell gnarf Is there anything wrong with this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/c1ff1e5d04f9
[18:02:33] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[18:02:33] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by Scott González (1m, 4s ago): Effects (fade): Delegate hiding and showing to core. Fixes #8267 - dialog fadein broken since 1.9m4.
[18:02:55] <kborchers> it definitely gets hot
[18:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'm a bit insulated right now because of the case that I have on mine.
[18:03:43] <kborchers> yeah
[18:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I should get another case
[18:03:50] <kborchers> so
[18:04:20] <kborchers> it said Done without errors but the site isn't updated :/
[18:04:36] <kborchers> i probably have something weird that i missed
[18:05:51] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[18:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> grunt wordpress-deploy --verbose
[18:06:07] <kborchers> i'll try that
[18:09:05] <kborchers> i think i know what might be wrong
[18:09:44] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: where should dir in cofig.json be?
[18:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[18:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> It shouldn't exist.
[18:10:08] <kborchers> oh
[18:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> Let me look at the repo.
[18:10:17] <kborchers> i added it
[18:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> You're working on api.jquery.com?
[18:10:24] <kborchers> based on something else i was looking at
[18:10:35] <kborchers> just trying to deploy something to make sure my env is set up
[18:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> Someone (Richard?) put it in the config is some repos. I took it out of some.
[18:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> None should have a dir in the config, since it's not configurable.
[18:11:03] <kborchers> ok
[18:11:35] * scott_gonzalez is pulling latest
[18:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, don't put dist in your config, it's defined in grunt.js.
[18:12:20] <kborchers> ok
[18:12:21] <scott_gonzalez> If you put it in your config, it'll overwrite it.
[18:15:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok next question :)
[18:15:54] <kborchers> i clone all of my repos to the same place so they are organized ... should i be cloning this into the wordpress site dir somewhere or how does it now where to deploy?
[18:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> It knows where to deploy based on your config.json :-)
[18:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> It should contain url, username, password.
[18:17:23] <scott_gonzalez> All for WordPress.
[18:17:35] <kborchers> yep, my url is in there and user and pass :/
[18:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> screenshare?
[18:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> Completely unrelated, this photo is amazing: http://www.flickr.com/photos/yury-prokopenko/3565697455/in/photostream/
[18:18:05] <kborchers> hmm, i have a mess
[18:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm good with messes
[18:18:57] <kborchers> there is something wrong with my server
[18:19:03] <kborchers> richard had me install mamp
[18:19:11] <kborchers> i already had apache running
[18:19:18] <kborchers> now things are weird
[18:19:36] <kborchers> i killed the other apache for now
[18:20:02] <kborchers> can't get to my wp-admin ... so i bet if i fix that this will work
[18:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> hah
[18:20:16] <kborchers> :)
[18:20:37] <kborchers> oh, i know what it is :)
[18:21:43] <kborchers> ok, got into wp-admin. running grunt again
