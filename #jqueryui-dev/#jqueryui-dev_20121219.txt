[05:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ping
[05:29:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: poing
[05:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> So, selectmenu...
[05:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> Why would we switch to the popup style?
[05:33:56] <jzaefferer> It matches the default behaviour of native selects, at least on OSX, and customizing that to the dropdown behavior should be easier then the other way round
[05:34:16] <jzaefferer> for dropdown you just need fixed properties for position, popup needs some calculations
[05:35:06] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is that reasonable?
[05:37:56] <scott_gonzalez> So we're changing the built in behavior because of OS X?
[05:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> We obviously didn't think that should be default behavior before.
[05:38:45] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #129: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/129/
[05:39:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm open to making the change, but it seems like a strange reason to be changing deafult behavior after all this time.
[05:41:06] <jzaefferer> Well, we also opted for default true to avoid false-by-default options, even though we have them elsewhere as well, like collapsible:false in accordion and tabs
[05:41:44] <jzaefferer> I don't think the arguments in either direction are particular strong
[05:41:53] <jzaefferer> That's why we introduced the option in the first place
[05:47:14] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's discuss at the meeting today and pick one.
[05:47:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with whichever, I was just curious why you thought we should change from the current default.
[05:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> Changing to popup menas we'd drop the position option, right?
[06:22:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: dropping position? maybe, depends on how the customization would then look like. I'll ping Felix, maybe he can join the meeting today
[06:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> Well, position is useless for popup, isn't it?
[06:24:03] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI 1-9-stable - 1.6.x core build #33: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%201.6.x%20core/33/
[06:24:27] <jzaefferer> The popup position could be the default
[06:28:22] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is there anything here that we can move to the api or learn sites? https://github.com/scottgonzalez/widget-factory-docs
[06:28:33] <jzaefferer> learn seems more likely
[06:28:45] <scott_gonzalez> The popup position isn't possible to write as a default.
[06:28:53] <scott_gonzalez> It's dynamic.
[06:29:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it should move to the learn site.
[06:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/209
[06:34:25] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: {position:null} as for appendTo:null?
[06:35:04] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: have you ever looked at the Apache license? How would you compare that to MIT? 
[06:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> It's basically MIT + patent protection
[06:36:02] <scott_gonzalez> position: null could make sense
[06:36:30] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's no crazier that magic positioning in HTML :-P
[06:39:18] <jzaefferer> magic positioning?
[06:39:48] <jzaefferer> also, what should the icons property name be?
[06:40:13] <jzaefferer> it should be icons: { something: default-value }, right?
[06:41:08] <scott_gonzalez> Magic positioning aligns one element with another, magically.
[06:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe button?
[06:41:28] <scott_gonzalez> We can discuss that at the meeting too.
[06:42:08] <jzaefferer> ah, you suggested "arrow" in your comment
[06:42:12] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:42:21] <jzaefferer> button seems good

[09:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Can you test this? https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli/pull/8
[09:01:24] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman wants someone on Windows to verify that it doesn't blow up.
[09:01:41] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately i can't get grunt 0.4 installed and/or running right
[09:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need grunt 0.4 to test it :-)
[09:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> You can clone my grunt-cli fork and `npm install -g`
[09:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> Then if `grunt` works for jquery, we're good.
[09:03:02] <DaveMethvin> at the moment, `grunt` doesn't work for jquery on my system
[09:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> This is just a small script which finds the local grunt and invokes that.
[09:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> Even with 0.3.x?
[09:03:54] <DaveMethvin> i can switch back to master, blow away my node_modules, npm install again, and see if that brings back 0.3 
[09:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> It should.
[09:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> If that works, it should be easy to test grunt-clie
[09:04:21] <scott_gonzalez> If it doesn't, don't worry about it.

[09:06:52] <DaveMethvin> lemme see if i can do this from windows cmd
[09:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> oh joy
[09:08:55] <DaveMethvin> nope
[09:09:12] <DaveMethvin> starting clean again
[09:11:30] <DaveMethvin> aw cmon
[09:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[09:11:45] <DaveMethvin> so is the new update-submodules backcompat with 0.3?
[09:11:45] <DaveMethvin> TypeError: Cannot call method 'spawn' of undefined
[09:11:46] <DaveMethvin>     at Object.<anonymous> (c:\inetpub\apache\jquery\node_modules\grunt-update-su
[09:11:46] <DaveMethvin> bmodules\tasks\update-submodules.js:7:14)
[09:12:00] <DaveMethvin> that's after what seemd to be a good install
[09:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[09:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> Must have bad dependency ranges listed.
[09:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> yup: "grunt-update-submodules": ">=0.1.2",
[09:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> See, people need to stop using version ranges in product code.
[09:13:24] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[09:13:35] <DaveMethvin> i want to know THE version it works with :D
[09:34:48] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: the gruntfile in your fork is named Gruntfile.js, should I just rename it to work with 0.3?
[09:35:17] <scott_gonzalez> Don't worry about that. You won't need to run grunt against that.
[09:36:15] <DaveMethvin> ok i'm a little confused here
[09:36:25] <DaveMethvin> next step is...?
[09:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> Front the grunt-cli checkout, run `npm install -g`
[09:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> You're on my resolve branch?
[09:38:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:38:55] <DaveMethvin> errors, permission
[09:39:16] <DaveMethvin> so does this need admin then?
[09:39:26] <DaveMethvin> generally  npm installs do not
[09:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> Well, this is a global install, so you might need admin permissions, depending on your settings.
[09:40:59] <scott_gonzalez> One of the first things I do on a new machine is chown /usr/local
[09:41:21] <DaveMethvin> not generally, i've done global installs without it and the install location is in a subtree that i (the user account) own and have write perms to
[09:41:53] <DaveMethvin> lemme look
[09:42:26] <DaveMethvin> ooh, i take that back
[09:42:31] <DaveMethvin> it's trying to write to the progrm dier
[09:42:32] <DaveMethvin> dir
[09:42:39] <DaveMethvin> that's not what other modules do 
[09:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, probably because this exports a binary.
[09:43:08] <DaveMethvin> a windows binary?
[09:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's really just an extensionless file with a shebang line.
[09:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's just a js file that runs through node.
[09:43:44] <DaveMethvin> seems like it should go in the "normal" install location
[09:43:50] <DaveMethvin> it's trying to put the file in  mkdir 'C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules\grunt-cli
[09:44:52] <DaveMethvin> it should be going in C:\Users\dave\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\grunt-cli
[09:44:54] <DaveMethvin> i think
[09:45:10] <DaveMethvin> but i don't know what the symbolic names are for that inside a npm package
[09:45:11] <scott_gonzalez> `npm folders`
[09:45:29] <scott_gonzalez> Damn, that always tricks me
[09:45:39] <scott_gonzalez> npm help folders exists, but not npm folders
[09:45:59] <DaveMethvin> npm help folders
[09:46:05] <DaveMethvin> or npm folders?
[09:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> npm config get prefix
[09:46:46] <DaveMethvin> C:\Program Files\nodejs
[09:47:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so that's what it's going to use.
[09:47:14] <scott_gonzalez> So you probably needed admin permission to install node.
[09:48:46] <DaveMethvin> yes, but never for a module
[09:49:26] <DaveMethvin> strange, even the npm config ls -l doesn't show the global node_modules location
[09:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> But you've done global installs before?
[09:49:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[09:50:01] <DaveMethvin> but the global installs are doing into 
[09:50:09] <DaveMethvin> C:\Users\dave\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules
[09:50:16] <DaveMethvin> not the program installation dir
[09:50:24] <DaveMethvin> they are "global" for me
[09:50:35] <DaveMethvin> but not global for the whole system
[09:50:47] <DaveMethvin> for all users, that is
[09:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> strange
[09:51:08] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea if any of this crap is documented
[09:51:52] <DaveMethvin> so as far as i know on windows, a "global" install goes into that folder and i add the C:\Users\dave\AppData\Roaming\npm to my path
[09:52:12] <DaveMethvin> it finds the alias there that first looks for a local one in the project, and then runs the global one
[09:53:07] <DaveMethvin> so is that what the little shell script you mentioned is doing? 
[09:55:37] <scott_gonzalez> The shell script is looking for the grunt installed for the project in CWD.
[09:55:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:56:01] <DaveMethvin> so that's what the scripts in my C:\Users\dave\AppData\Roaming\npm are doing
[09:56:02] <scott_gonzalez> The idea is to not actually have grunt globally installed.
[09:56:29] <scott_gonzalez> grunt-cli provides the global grunt binary which just finds the local grunt and executes it.
[09:57:46] <DaveMethvin> so how is that different from https://gist.github.com/4338817 ?
[09:58:16] <DaveMethvin> that's the file named `grunt` from my C:\Users\dave\AppData\Roaming\npm 
[09:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> Well, bash confuses me, but...
[09:59:09] <DaveMethvin> me too :D
[09:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> You can do this from anywhere inside your project.
[09:59:39] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need to be in the directory that has the gruntfile.
[10:00:07] <DaveMethvin> right but if C:\Users\dave\AppData\Roaming\npm  is on my path it's going to find this file, so whatever you install may not be executed
[10:00:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well you should get rid of that file then :-P
[10:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> The purpose of grunt-cli is to do what this is doing, but to do it as smart as possible.
[10:00:44] <DaveMethvin> that file shows up when i npm install -g grunt
[10:01:07] <DaveMethvin> and i did that because grunt says it wants -g
[10:01:17] <DaveMethvin> and i'll need to have both 0.3 and 0.4 at least for a while
[10:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, don't listen to it :-P
[10:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> grunt shouldn't be installed globally.
[10:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> At least not any more.
[10:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> You'll want grunt inside jquery/node_modules.
[10:02:18] <DaveMethvin> sure, and that little script ensures that if i do it will find it, i think
[10:02:24] <scott_gonzalez> And then you want to test that with your shell script gone (or renamed), that grunt-cli works.
[10:03:16] <DaveMethvin> i'm just saying it's odd that grunt-cli needs to write into the program dir for something that isn't a binary, if i understood you correctly it's just the same kind of stub that already is written into C:\Users\dave\AppData\Roaming\npm 
[10:03:29] <DaveMethvin> and that's writable by me already
[10:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure. You'd need to ask isaacs about that.
[10:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> I can say, with confidence, that it's unrelated to the change I made :-P
[10:07:35] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i just checked my program files node_modules and the only thing in there is npm, no other third-party code
[10:08:12] <DaveMethvin> in the other dir i have grunt, bower, npm, jshint node-gyp
[10:09:53] <DaveMethvin> and i only  have program files\nodejs and the aforementioned "global" location in my path, does grunt-cli write something into program files\nodejs? 
[10:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> It writes wherever npm is configured to.
[10:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't do anything special, just defines a bin property in package.json.

[10:26:38] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: okay, i went ahead and ran as admin ... it didn't look like it was going to put the files in the right place, and it didn't
[10:26:48] <DaveMethvin> let me check my other system install and see if it works there
[10:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: DaveMethvin seems to be having a lot of trouble with grunt-cli on Windows.
[10:30:27] <ben_alman> the new one
[10:30:28] <ben_alman> or the old one
[10:30:32] <ben_alman> i mean, yours or mine
[10:31:06] <DaveMethvin> no dice on the other system, i forgot i had to clean-install recently (it's windows 8)
[10:31:19] <DaveMethvin> so it would take an hour just to get everything setup  to test
[10:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: Well, he's having trouble getting it installed properly.
[10:31:23] <scott_gonzalez> Not even running it.
[10:31:25] <ben_alman> hmmn
[10:31:30] <ben_alman> let me try
[10:31:36] <DaveMethvin> so ben_alman
[10:31:37] <ben_alman> with the one in npm
[10:31:38] <ben_alman> or yours
[10:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> He's trying `npm install -g` from my branch.
[10:32:01] <ben_alman> hmmn
[10:32:09] <ben_alman> what's the exact command
[10:32:11] <DaveMethvin> what seems to be happening is that it's putting the file in the program dir but that's not on my path
[10:32:32] <DaveMethvin> let me see if i can get a full log
[10:33:51] <ben_alman> ok so i did npm install -g grunt-cli and that worked fine
[10:33:58] <DaveMethvin> ok, let me be sure of initial conditions
[10:34:11] <DaveMethvin> grunt 0.3, not installed globally
[10:34:13] <ben_alman> then i cloned grunt-cli and did an npm install inside of it and ran grunt and it properly grunted grunt-cli in windows
[10:34:17] <ben_alman> ok
[10:34:18] <DaveMethvin> npm install grunt
[10:34:26] <DaveMethvin> that finishes ok
[10:34:34] <DaveMethvin> no grunt or grunt.cmd in path
[10:34:57] <ben_alman> you need to install grunt-cli globally now to get a grunt command in your path
[10:35:01] <ben_alman> grunt is just a lib now
[10:35:07] <ben_alman> grunt-cli is the command
[10:35:13] <DaveMethvin> right, so i can't install from shell, so
[10:35:26] <ben_alman> what do you mean
[10:35:30] <DaveMethvin> npm install -g from windows cmd
[10:35:30] <ben_alman> youcant install from shell
[10:35:41] <ben_alman> i just did npm install -g grunt-cli
[10:35:46] <ben_alman> in windows 7 cmd.exe
[10:36:25] <DaveMethvin> ok so from windows cmd, npm install -g
[10:36:27] <DaveMethvin> that works
[10:36:34] <ben_alman> ok
[10:36:35] <DaveMethvin> back to jquery
[10:36:50] <ben_alman> should i clone jquery?
[10:37:00] <DaveMethvin> no, that DID seem to work
[10:37:12] <DaveMethvin> i swear i just did this
[10:37:23] <ben_alman> doing "npm install -g grunt-cli" installs the latest grunt-cli from npm
[10:37:31] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez was trying to get you to install his fork
[10:37:40] <ben_alman> which is why i asked you what command you used to install it
[10:37:41] <DaveMethvin> grunt-cli v0.1.5
[10:37:41] <DaveMethvin> grunt v0.3.17
[10:37:42] <ben_alman> the exact command
[10:38:21] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: no i did npm install -g from within scott's fork
[10:38:31] <ben_alman> you can't do that
[10:38:35] <ben_alman> you do "npm link"
[10:38:41] <ben_alman> from within his fork's root dir
[10:38:46] <ben_alman> npm ins good times :D
[10:38:55] <ben_alman> i'm going to clone his fork
[10:38:56] <DaveMethvin> wat
[10:39:22] <ben_alman> "npm link" is the command one uses to "install" a local project "globally"
[10:39:31] <ben_alman> and not just "npm install -g"
[10:39:44] <DaveMethvin> oh great i was in the wrong dir
[10:39:44] <ben_alman> that probably, like installs all the local project's dependencies globally or something stupid
[10:39:57] <ben_alman> npm dev isn't the most super awesome thing
[10:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: npm install -g should work
[10:40:02] <DaveMethvin> okay, so i will probalby need to completely blow everything away
[10:40:11] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez: i'm pretty sure it does something broken
[10:40:18] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin: reformat your computer
[10:40:19] <scott_gonzalez> worksforme
[10:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[10:40:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah :D
[10:40:28] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez: it might due to some pre-existing condition
[10:40:37] <ben_alman> "npm link" is the command one is supposed to use
[10:40:38] <DaveMethvin> i think that's what we may be running into
[10:40:57] <ben_alman> https://npmjs.org/doc/link.html
[10:41:19] <DaveMethvin> okay, i would buy that
[10:41:46] <DaveMethvin> but in that case, i don't think i want to npm install -g on this, right? i don't want it to write to my program dir
[10:41:58] <ben_alman> clone it
[10:42:08] <ben_alman> then inside his gruint-cli root run "npm link"
[10:42:15] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: https://npmjs.org/doc/install.html
[10:42:16] <ben_alman> and then the global "Grunt" will be his
[10:42:23] <DaveMethvin> right
[10:42:24] <ben_alman> to undo it, just npm install -g grunt-cli
[10:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> First usage: npm install (with no args in a package dir)
[10:42:26] <ben_alman> and it'll overwrite
[10:43:03] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez: just saying, i use npm link
[10:43:07] <ben_alman> isaacs recommended it to me
[10:43:11] <ben_alman> dunno what the difference is
[10:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:43:20] <ben_alman> all i know is it's MAD confusing
[10:43:23] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the difference is an actual install vs. a link.
[10:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> with `npm install -g` you'd need to re-install after every change.
[10:44:11] <DaveMethvin> but the point is, i just want the "global command" to point to the grunt-cli dir and link does that
[10:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> So, can you grunt jquery using my branch of grunt-cli?
[10:44:48] <DaveMethvin> installing now
[10:45:37] <DaveMethvin> well it's running grunt but i'm not sure of the heritage at this point :)
[10:45:57] <DaveMethvin> /c/Users/dave/AppData/Roaming/npm/grunt
[10:46:05] <DaveMethvin> that's my favorite location, lemme see what it looks like
[10:46:05] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez: it's throwing an exception
[10:46:11] <ben_alman> trying to find a local grunt
[10:46:17] <DaveMethvin> not me
[10:46:24] <DaveMethvin> windows being superior and all :P
[10:47:10] <DaveMethvin> what tha
[10:48:27] <DaveMethvin> https://gist.github.com/4339308
[10:48:40] <DaveMethvin> i know shell syntax can be strange but does that look right?
[10:48:50] <ben_alman> that might be something npm does
[10:49:23] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[10:49:35] <DaveMethvin> welcome to CYGWIN!
[10:49:48] <DaveMethvin> the rest of it looks like the standard boilerplate
[10:50:07] <ben_alman> hmmn
[10:50:17] <ben_alman> not sure npm link works in my weird win 7 vm
[10:51:00] <ben_alman> npm install -g git://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-cli.git#cff0496d111f608de1a794cd49db86875fc40659
[10:51:03] <ben_alman> that seems to be working
[10:52:57] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez: weird http://benalman.com/grab/1fef60.png
[10:53:10] <ben_alman> i have no idea what's causing that
[10:53:13] <DaveMethvin> okay, well in that case i can return to my original problem which was to find out why 0.4 is blowing up installing lodash
[10:53:26] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin: i think others are having problems with lodash on windows
[10:53:31] <ben_alman> check their issues tracker
[10:53:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah and i thought i had it pegged
[10:53:50] <DaveMethvin> they are trying to exec npm from within their installer
[10:53:56] <DaveMethvin> and exec is sad on windows
[10:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: Does master grunt-cli work properly in that case?
[10:54:09] <ben_alman> sec
[10:54:17] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like the problem should be inside grunt, not grunt-cli.
[10:54:45] <ben_alman> yeah it's a grunt problem
[10:56:59] <DaveMethvin> oh yay, grunt 0.4 works with jquery -- but i have no idea why at this point :)
[10:58:24] <DaveMethvin> well, mv node_modules old_modules and try again :D
[10:58:55] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez: aha super obscure error
[10:58:56] <ben_alman> fixing now
[10:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:10:42] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez: it seems fine
[11:10:46] <ben_alman> i'm going to merge it
[11:10:51] <scott_gonzalez> yay

[11:33:49] <DaveMethvin> oooh burn
[11:35:25] <DaveMethvin> total sympathy though, this process seems very unclear to me at least
[11:35:57] <DaveMethvin> installation and dependency management across multiple operating systems is the bottom level of the rings of hell
