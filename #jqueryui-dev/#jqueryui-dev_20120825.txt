[03:22:27] <rgbdev> I'm using the "shake" effect and it's oddly moving the content below it…would somebody be able to take a look?
[03:26:03] <rgbdev> Go to http://farfrom.it/?autoplay=no#form , open up console and scroll to 4100 px from the top and stop. The email form should shake to get your attention. It's nudging that content below it….how come?
[03:35:47] <rgbdev> Any ideas?
