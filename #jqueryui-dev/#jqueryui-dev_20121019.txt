[08:26:32] * rxaviers is back in his desk in Brazil :)
[08:27:12] <cloudbrows> Hope you had comfortable, uneventful travel, rxaviers.

[08:30:31] <cloudbrows> hah - so preparations is the wrong word. at this point, you're just strapping in and getting ready for the ride
[08:30:57] <rxaviers> lol pretty much
[09:03:51] <mikesherov> scott-gonzalez: I finally cracked and made the boilerplate pending response for jQuery UI
[09:04:03] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8602#comment:3
[10:18:13] <mikesherov> gnarf: is this done now? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7353#comment:7
[10:33:01] <gnarf> mikesherov: done enough
[10:33:03] <gnarf> closed it
[10:33:15] <mikesherov> thanks!
[10:33:31] <mikesherov> while I have you… do you know the fate of this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6781
[10:33:58] <mikesherov> looks like you guys said no go to it? https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/4
[10:34:27] <mikesherov> gnarf: ^
[10:35:27] <gnarf> we decided to pass on it in 1.9
[10:35:32] <gnarf> i still want to try to get it working
[10:35:40] <gnarf> in a way scott_gonzalez likes
[10:36:04] <gnarf> but might end up having to just make a ui-text-effects plugin
[10:36:26] <gnarf> final flight is boarding soon... just waiting for them to call my gate
[10:36:30] <gnarf> er "zone"
[10:37:37] <mikesherov> so are you headed home now?
[10:37:48] <gnarf> yup
[14:57:07] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, hello guys. About "ThemeRoller: Better example of content icon", one idea was to add an icon on the content body of each of the tabs. Does it work for you? https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/45
[14:57:52] <rxaviers> (I need your feedback of the idea only for now, plz)
[15:32:34] <rxaviers>  
[15:32:35] <rxaviers> [L28:C30] Expected '!==' and instead saw '!='.
[15:32:36] <rxaviers>       if( texture.file != "02_glass.png" ) {
[15:34:34] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - git core build #161: STILL FAILING in 38 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/161/
[15:38:09] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, gnarf, scott_gonzalez, should all lint errors be fixed including the above? I dont see the trouble having the "!=" only.. :(
[15:38:53] <rxaviers>  
[15:38:54] <rxaviers> another question
[15:38:57] <rxaviers> [L386:C32] Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.
[15:38:57] <rxaviers>         if ( file.data == undefined ) {//null or undefined
[15:39:09] <rxaviers> In the above, Im using == because I wanna check null or undefined.
[15:39:20] <rxaviers> should we change the condition to check them both explicitly?
[16:07:11] <_zoggy_> well === is to check 'type' besides value
[16:07:42] <_zoggy_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/javascript-vs-does-it-matter-which-equal-operator-i-use
[16:08:26] <_zoggy_> i know jui does === usually unless its with regards to keypresses as ie does stuff differently (throws null instead of undefined) or whatever the case
[16:10:16] <_zoggy_> now about your specific question.. dunno :)

[16:20:09] <doesallmagic> zjs: Mask: fix visual test to bind to blur as stated in the test's textual description
[16:36:59] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: icons inside tabs was might thought as well.
[16:37:06] <scott_gonzalez> For tooltip I'd rather not use images.
[16:38:07] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: use eqnull to get == null checked (and use null instead of undefined)
[16:38:26] <scott_gonzalez> For everything else, you must use strict equality checks.

[18:00:35] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/tooltip-bugfixes] Tooltip: Comment why we need to use closest - Jörn Zaefferer
[18:00:35] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/tooltip-bugfixes] Tooltip: Fix nested tooltips by closing parent tooltips and removing title attributes. Fixes #8700 - Overlapping tooltipped elements shows native tooltip for one of the elements - Jörn Zaefferer
[18:00:35] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/tooltip-bugfixes] Tooltip: Only bind blur when opening via focus, mouseleave for mouseover. Fixes #8699 - Moving focus on click of a tooltipped element shows native tooltip in IE/Firefox on Windows - Jörn Zaefferer
[18:18:33] <zjs> gnarf: I added two commits to my PR to address updating (1) the buffer and (2) the optionalPosition when removing characters from the mask
[18:21:20] <zjs> I'll re-write history to clean things up once you've had a chance to take a look, but figured it'd be easier to review with the fixes as separate changes
