[07:02:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wow! I just (re)discovered https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5390 ... we have a few more places where we reference ui-disabled.
[07:02:39] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5390 by gabrielschulhof (8mon 2w ago): Rename class ui-disabled to ui-state-disabled and implement .widget() method
[07:03:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess we can leave those and fix them after 1.4.0, but it's not such a big change to fix them now, is it?
[07:03:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's a straight search-and-replace, although I have found some ugly code like $( this ).is( ".ui-disabled, .ui-btn-active" ) in navbar.
[07:04:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, would be nice if we can do it all in 14
[07:04:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so we can remove ui-disabled all together in 1.5
[07:05:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, we have deprecated in in 1.4.0, right?
[07:05:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we can remove it in 1.5.0 anyway.
[07:05:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: be careful with your search and replace... the selector has to stay in theme.css for 1.4 ;)
[07:05:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I meant to search and replace only in js/
[07:05:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that's true
[07:06:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But I'm going to perf-test .is( ".class1, .class2" ) vs. .hasClass( "class1" ) || .hasClass( "class2" ) and replace that too, because I have a feeling the latter is faster than the former.
[07:07:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: after 1.3 final I replaced all is() by hasClass() where possible
[07:08:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that was based on a perf test
[07:08:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: makes sense because is() can do more
[07:08:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but .is( ".class1, .class2" ) totally overkills it.
[07:09:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think .is makes sense when the determination would be too complicated otherwise.
[07:09:27] <scott_gonzalez> I think .is() makes sense almost always.
[07:09:39] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you're in some code that is actually a bottleneck.
[07:09:44] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, but at what price?
[07:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> You tell me.
[07:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> What's the price?
[07:10:08] <_|Nix|_> Well, it sounds like uGoMobi has already done the test.
[07:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> Where is it?
[07:12:52] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Here's one I bumped into because of a slug-collision: http://jsperf.com/is-vs-hasclass2
[07:13:32] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... but that only tests one class. I'm curious about ".a, .b"
[07:13:42] <scott_gonzalez> 130k ops/sec isn't slow.
[07:14:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: is there any where that we are using is in a loop?
[07:14:26] <arschmitz> or where this will be a bottle neck of some sort ?
[07:15:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's in a vclick handler for navbar.
[07:15:27] <_|Nix|_> So no loop, but response-time-critical.
[07:15:41] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: _|Nix|_ : http://jsperf.com/hasclass-vs-is-so
[07:16:38] <scott_gonzalez> Those results are from an unknown version of jQuery.
[07:17:17] <scott_gonzalez> You're not going to see a difference in performance from one call to this.
[07:17:22] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Then try the one I just created, which tests ".a, .b" ) vs. ||
[07:17:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: http://jsperf.com/is-vs-hasclass-two-classes
[07:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> We're talking about less than a tenth of a millisecond.
[07:20:18] <arschmitz> that is an amount so small it is impossible to notice by a human
[07:23:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! That handler is getting worse and worse. Not only is it doing that, but $( this ) appears like three times in it.
[07:23:25] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway. The point is that these microbenchmarks aren't useful.
[07:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> What you want to measure is the entire action you're performing.
[07:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> There's likely no difference in the time.
[07:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> For example, anything that causes a reflow will completely kill the perf benefit of a micro benchmark change.
[07:26:54] <_|Nix|_> I wish we had a performance team.
[07:27:53] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, I'll continue getting rid of ui-disabled in favour of ui-state-disabled.

[08:13:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: hmmm i just realized there is no good way to do custom 404 pages in JQM
[08:14:10] <arschmitz> or custom error pages in general
[08:14:24] <arschmitz> or any sort of error page really
[08:15:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you mean instead of an error message redirect to a 404 JQM-page?
[08:15:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: essentially even if you have a custom error page setup it wont be shown with ajax nav
[08:16:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you mean? Like, if an AJAX request returns 404?
[08:16:01] <arschmitz> because of the 404 status
[08:16:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[08:16:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, you have to implement it client-side.
[08:16:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Handle pageloadfailed.
[08:16:56] <arschmitz> right thats not a good way at all
[08:16:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or, rather pagecontainerloadfailed :)
[08:17:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's kinda dumb, actually, because 404 does not mean that no page has come from the server.
[08:17:48] <arschmitz> exactly
[08:17:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, one should still receive a page.
[08:18:04] <arschmitz> and there are actually specific recomendations that you should have custom error pages
[08:18:13] <arschmitz> just in general
[08:18:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, but is there nothing you can set in the XHR to get the error page?
[08:19:04] <arschmitz> for example this is githubs guide to error pages https://github.com/styleguide/templates/2.0
[08:20:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you can
[08:20:14] <arschmitz> its the third argument to ajax error
[08:20:56] <arschmitz> i think i need to double check that
[08:22:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do we bubble that all the way through to pagecontainerloadfailed?
[08:22:42] <arschmitz> not sure just a sec
[08:22:47] <arschmitz>  ajax
[08:22:49] <asheppard> couldn't you just assume that the server sent the custom 404 html together with the code?
[08:23:04] <asheppard> and check the ajax response
[08:23:22] <arschmitz> asheppard: basicly yes right now this does not happen though which is the problem
[08:23:47] <arschmitz> it just displays error loading page and calls it a day
[08:23:57] <asheppard> yes i have noticed that
[08:23:58] <arschmitz> it should be possible to show the custom 404 page
[08:24:05] <arschmitz> or 500
[08:24:08] <arschmitz> or whatever 
[08:25:02] <arschmitz> it would be pretty easy to implement this as a global option i think 
[08:25:28] <asheppard> probably
[08:25:34] <asheppard> looking through my stuff it appears that i'm using a client-side 404 handler
[08:25:58] <asheppard> but in theory i should be using the server's page
[08:26:29] <arschmitz> yeah right now its not really possible to use server error pages in jqm
[08:26:33] <asheppard> i just happen to know that the result is the same in my case
[08:26:37] <asheppard> (as i'm using the same templates on client and server)
[08:26:51] <arschmitz> right which is currently the best you can do i think
[08:28:41] <asheppard> here's what i came up with, not sure if it's helpful
[08:28:47] <asheppard> https://github.com/wq/wq.app/blob/master/js/app.js#L363-L372
[08:28:56] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#767 (master - c5c84ec : Gabriel Schulhof): The build passed.

[08:29:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so to get the response on error you check the response prop of the first argument to error
[08:29:52] <arschmitz> asheppard: thanks i think the idea here would be to handle this all in one step rather then load essentially the same page again
[08:30:38] <arschmitz> asheppard: on error check a global option to show server error pages if true just use the response text as the page 
[08:31:06] <arschmitz> but i think your solution is the only one that would currently work
[08:31:08] <asheppard> arschmitz: yeah especially if you can rely on the server providing html
[08:31:26] <arschmitz> asheppard: yeah thats why the option is good by default assume it does not
[08:31:32] <arschmitz> and just show message
[08:31:54] <arschmitz> but if you set option to true your saying it will provide an error page and to use it
[08:32:25] <asheppard> arschmitz: sounds reasonable
[08:32:59] <arschmitz> yeah too late for 1.4 i think but i think this should be high priority for 1.5 this seems really bad to me 
[08:34:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: File an issue and milestone it as 1.5.0.
[08:34:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I suppose this is true for all error codes.
[08:34:31] <arschmitz> yes
[08:34:51] <arschmitz> and im going to file an issue right now to add option to use response on error
[08:35:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think we should still fire pagecontainerloadfailed though.
[08:35:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Even if that option is on.
[08:35:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: of course
[08:36:03] <arschmitz> thats where this would happen
[08:36:03] <asheppard> (side note: might not be apparent that my example uses a custom url router that tries localStorage+template first, the loadPage code being a fallback for when i can't cram everything into localStorage)
[08:36:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also im wondering if you should be able to prevent default on that event
[08:36:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I didn't know that the widget factory has stopped adding ui-state-disabled during _setOptions({ disabled: true }) ...
[08:37:02] <asheppard> yes, the option would be nice
[08:37:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes uses widget specfic disabled class now
[08:37:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno what that would mean. It failed - not much you can do about it.
[08:37:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well we do a bunch of stuff when it fails
[08:37:52] <arschmitz> you could prevent that
[08:37:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, it could be like pbc in that you can alter the toPage data item.
[08:38:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh problem with that
[08:38:31] <arschmitz> we resolve a deferred in there and that would never happen if you prevented default and it worked
[08:39:23] <arschmitz> maybe move it to after the deffered and allow it or something i dunno can look at it when adding custom pages
[08:42:23] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz opened issue #6438: Allow the use of custom server error pages instead of generic error message  02http://git.io/lATeRA
[08:42:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good catch!
[08:43:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: was commenting on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6435 when i thought of it
[08:43:21] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6435 by miguelsan (2h 25m ago): AjaxError does not allow setting loading delay
[08:44:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and not that long ago had a whole long conversation about best practices with server error pages with someone where we were talking about githubs error page guidelines 
[08:44:56] <arschmitz> and jqm makes this essentially impossible
[08:46:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yet another one of the Web's features we haven't addressed yet.
[08:46:27] <arschmitz> yeah should be a simple fix once 1.4 is done
[08:47:12] <asheppard> is it possible to track server-side redirects?
[08:47:20] <arschmitz> asheppard: no
[08:47:26] <asheppard> so setting data-url is required
[08:48:13] <arschmitz> asheppard: yes server side redirects are transparent to the browser no way to know
[08:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I looked at that tooltip bug this morning. I don't see where the remove handler is being added.
[08:52:34] <scott_gonzalez> I saw the line you pointed out where it's conditionally removed.
[08:59:21] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.tooltip.js#L285
[09:00:15] <tj_vantoll> So keyup, remove, and mouseleave/focusout are assigned there. mouseleave, focusout, and keyup are always removed via https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.tooltip.js#L333.
[09:00:24] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...not sure how I missed that. I even searched multiple times.
[09:00:25] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.

[10:28:53] <fnagel> scott_gonzales jzaefferer Would you mind taking a look at the latest Selectmenu Wiki page comment? I'm not sure how to answer this. http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[10:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel kborchers jzaefferer: We should probably change the styles, even for normal menus.
[10:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> I've never liked the menu styling.
[10:40:00] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I fixed your comment.
[10:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> You said you don't like option 2, but you meant option 1.
[10:40:43] <fnagel> Just for my curiosity: are there any ideas to change the CSS framework at all?
[10:41:12] <scott_gonzalez> The actual framework? Yes.
[10:41:33] <fnagel> Something I could read in the wiki?
[10:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> Though we don't know what it will change to.
[10:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> Mobile has a different theming system.
[10:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> We're also looking at Topcoat.
[10:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> No, because we don't know any details about it yet.
[10:45:28] <fnagel> Never heard of Topcoat before. Did you discuss bootstrap? The new version did remove some ugly issues with a11y etc. 
[10:45:53] <fnagel> I guess we'll change this when Mobile merge comes closer
[10:48:21] <gseguin> fnagel: http://topcoat.io
[10:50:57] <fnagel> Thanks found the link myself :-)
[11:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: We don't expect Twitter to even consider collaboration.
[11:15:24] <fnagel> scott_gonzales: right, I dont think that will ever happen too. 
[11:16:20] <fnagel> scott_gonzales: Anyway, I think we do not change CSS framework in near future. What should I respont to the Wiki comment? 
[11:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> The wiki comment is unrelated to changing the CSS Framework.
[11:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> I think we should change the menu styling.
[11:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> (and my name ends in z)
[11:19:21] <fnagel> I will open a ticket for Menu. 
[11:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[11:21:13] <fnagel> Sorry. I'm still not that famliar with IRC and currently I need to type the name manually :-/ I really need to dig deeper into Pidgin
[11:40:53] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: While writing the ticket I noticed a potential Selectmenu issue: when the menu is opened with an selected item, the class of the selected item is ui-state-focus (set via Menu widget) which is correct as the item actually has focus, but it should have ui-state-active (which solves the "similar style" issue), too. Question: should Selectmenu always keep ui-state-active and add ui-state-focus only to focused items?
[11:49:38] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:52:18] <fnagel> Mhh we had this once. Seems its gine due to menu changes. I will open a ticket for that ;-)
[12:24:32] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thank you for fixing my comment
