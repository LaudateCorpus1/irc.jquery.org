[05:58:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: probably not completely necessary but let me know if you get a chance to look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1002 before the meeting â€¦ default draggable demo works in latest Chrome, FF, Opera, and Safari, IE10 Desktop and Win Phone 8, Safari iOS 6, Android 4.0.3 default browser and Chrome
[07:05:04] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I can do that PR, but if you want me to test it first, I have to wait until I get home (I don't have the correct computer with me right now)
[07:05:31] <agcolom> Otherwise, I can just do a PR with the github editor now... 
[07:05:37] <agcolom> which option would you prefer?
[07:07:24] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez_: ^
[07:07:43] <scott_gonzalez_> It seems pretty safe to do without testing.
[07:07:55] <agcolom> ok, will do it as a PR now then
[07:07:58] <agcolom> Thanks.
[08:23:01] <scott_gonzalez_> kborchers: It looks like you removed some of the logic from the existing MSPointer hook.
[08:26:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez_: hmm, yeah â€¦ not sure how that happened :/
[08:27:10] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: fingers crossed but i may be a little late for the meeting â€¦ waiting on my car at the shop
[08:27:51] <scott_gonzalez_> ok
[08:28:35] <kborchers> they were supposed to be done by now but of course ...
[08:49:14] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: made it back home so won't be late
