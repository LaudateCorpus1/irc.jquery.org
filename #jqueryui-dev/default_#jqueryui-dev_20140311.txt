[02:45:14] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Talkless opened issue #7232: JQM 1.4.2: Anchor buttons width is different when used inside footer with grid?) 02http://git.io/EYHUpg
[02:57:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7232 ... I guess we made anchors inline-block, eh? I had a previous issue that was not a bug where I advised that the OP add display: block back in manually in order to achieve the 100% width behaviour.
[03:02:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we always intended to make buttons in toolbars default to inline and mini
[03:03:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there used to be code for this in buttonMarkup, but now it is done with CSS only
[03:03:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the problem comes with the grid
[03:04:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I suppose the JS (1.3) only looked for immediate children, while the CSS (1.4) all buttons
[03:04:43] <uGoMobi> s/all buttons/affects all buttons/
[03:05:00] <_|Nix|_> Right ...
[03:05:19] <_|Nix|_> So, ummm ... I guess this can be overridden with custom CSS.
[03:05:26] <_|Nix|_> I'm still looking for that damned issue.
[03:05:33] <_|Nix|_> The GH search facility isn't.
[03:05:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what issue?
[03:06:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly. Can't fscking find it because GH is shit for search >:(
[03:06:51] <uGoMobi> _zoggy_: what issue can't you find?
[03:06:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There was an OP who was trying to achieve a width: 100% button in a footer.
[03:07:06] <uGoMobi> oops, wrong name
[03:07:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wrote an example setting the display back to block.
[03:07:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and closed the issue.
[03:08:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Found it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7222
[03:09:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we should fix it in the library
[03:09:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, really? So, header/footer buttons should once more not be inline/mini by default?
[03:09:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can assign it to me
[03:10:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, Should I reopen 7222 as well?
[03:10:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7222 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7232 are duplicates.
[03:10:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, buttons in grids should always be block
[03:10:42] <uGoMobi> even when they are inside a toolbar
[03:10:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Then I'll reopen https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7222 and assign both to you.
[03:10:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Milestone?
[03:10:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 1.4.3?
[03:11:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: my "no" was not regarding that they are duplicates
[03:12:33] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'm conf00zed.

[03:12:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, anyway, you got 'em both.
[03:13:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just didn't checked yet if they are duplicates 
[03:14:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7222 is not a duplicate but not a bug either
[03:15:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7222 can be closed, eh? OK. In that case, I will re-close it.
[03:15:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, thanks

[03:25:32] <agcolom> Hi, could someone please check https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/285
[03:25:36] <agcolom> Thank you
[03:38:15] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Looking ...
[03:38:23] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Thank you :-)
[03:39:57] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: In textinput, I put the "This option is provided by the ???? extension." as the first statement of the description rather than the last statement. I suppose we should decide one way oe the other.
[03:40:34] <agcolom> yes....
[03:40:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think?
[03:41:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Should we start an option/method description with which extension provides it, or should we conclude it with which extension provides it?
[03:41:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ agcolom : looking now
[03:41:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Compare with textinput options.
[03:43:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ agcolom : I think it's best to start with mentioning the extension it is provided by first
[03:47:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm about to comment on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7232, but I don't want to say anything dumb, so correct me if I'm wrong: We want header/footer anchors to be inline and mini by default, but only if they are immediate children of the toolbar, right?
[03:47:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was about to comment too :)
[03:48:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, then go ahead.
[03:48:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You're more qualified than I am.
[03:48:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but yes, that seems correct
[03:48:25] * _|Nix|_ types Ctrl+A,Backspace on his comment.
[03:49:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just want to look at 1.3 buttonMarkup first to double check how things used to be
[03:51:58] <agcolom> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_ ok, I'll make the change.
[03:52:03] <agcolom> Thank you
[03:52:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks
[03:52:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.

[03:52:35] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sorry, didn't think of this when we talked about it yesterday
[03:52:54] <_|Nix|_> The reason for the flaky page unit tests seems to be that the delegated handler sometimes doesn't get attached!
[03:52:56] <agcolom> no problem :-)
[03:53:16] <_|Nix|_> Like, whaaaa ?!
[03:53:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: didn't you mention this before?
[03:53:35] <_|Nix|_> *clunk* <-- That's the sound of my jaw hitting the floor.
[03:53:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I knew the handler wasn't getting called, but I didn't know why.
[03:54:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Was it not getting called because the selector for the delegation wasn't matching?
[03:54:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It seems the answer is that it's not getting attached in the first place.
[03:55:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Which is super-weird.
[03:55:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now, I need to trace through the attach process to see where it branches incorrectly.
[03:55:54] <_|Nix|_> This is a super-lengthy process, because every time I add a console.log I have to run the build on travis, like, 25 times before I get a failure.

[05:37:56] <uGoMobi> rxaviers: np
[05:46:47] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: that looks wrong. "css.button" doesn't match anything currently used in mobile, where you've got "css.structure" and "css.theme". We can use the same pattern in UI, since we also separate structure and theme, and not all components need the theme (like the interactions)
[05:49:25] <rxaviers> Ah! I've overlooked that, you are correct. So, "css.structure" or "css.theme" are the two declaratives.
[05:58:20] <rxaviers> Actually, mobile uses structure or theme as bundle names
[05:58:28] <rxaviers> edited: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/178#issuecomment-37291722
[05:58:50] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: rxaviers: also its not the relative path from the file its the relative path from the js directory 
[05:59:09] <rxaviers> thanks arschmitz, jzaefferer has also pointed that out on github
[05:59:13] <arschmitz> but since ui does not have subfolders in the ui directory it would be the same
[05:59:16] <arschmitz> oh ok 
[06:01:23] <rxaviers> So, css.theme is always "../css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css". But, css.structure is being used to concatenate the CSS files.
[06:01:39] <arschmitz> rxaviers: right we only have one theme file
[06:02:06] <arschmitz> but this makes it so you can exclude the dependency on that if its not needed
[06:02:29] <arschmitz> we have many components that have no theme or even no structure css that is required
[06:02:44] <rxaviers> I see
[06:03:01] <arschmitz> an example would be our touch events like swipe
[06:03:54] <arschmitz> there is no css needed for that in which case no css comments are needed at all

[06:25:34] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 06fix-page-tests: 02http://git.io/Y77-ZQ
[06:25:34] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06fix-page-tests 1455629c7 15Gabriel Schulhof: Tests: Attach handlers during module setup and remove during teardown
[06:27:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: I'm pretty sure I've figured out why that page unit test is flaky: It's because we attach the handlers which record whether they've been called from the top scope of the file, rather than from the module's setup callback.
[06:28:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: The bottom line is that you $( "body" ).on( "pagebeforecreate", "#c", function() {}); before domready, so $( "body" ).length === 0, so you end up attaching nothing.
[06:29:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: And whether that line executes before or after domready is highly environment-specific, because IINM those two things are truly asynchronous.
[06:29:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: should be using $( document )
[06:29:36] <arschmitz> $( document ).on( "pagebeforecreate" , "body", function(){})
[06:29:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it should also be done during setup and undone during teardown.
[06:29:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can do both with a fix.
[06:29:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that too
[06:30:04] <arschmitz> but by delegating the handler you dont need to worry about he timing 
[06:30:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You do, if you're attaching it to an element that may not be there.
[06:30:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's where the $( document ) comes in.
[06:30:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right thats what i was talking about
[06:31:03] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... in the end, it was a no-brainer :/
[06:35:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what was that pr you needed reviewed
[06:36:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6901?
[06:37:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I don't think we can go with module setup in that page test, because I think it wants to catch things that happen during autoinit as well, which is before the module setup gets called.

[14:40:30] <agcolom> Hi Alex! 
[14:41:18] <agcolom> On the api docs, I'd like to go through some issues with you
[14:41:20] <agcolom> but github is experiencing some connection issues, 
[14:41:27] <agcolom> so probably not a good time anymore ;-)
[14:41:34] <arschmitz> lol ok
[14:41:50] <agcolom> like we have some dead old issues which we may be able to close, 
[14:41:56] <arschmitz> yeah looks like i cant get there at all right now
[14:42:02] <arschmitz> sounds good
[14:42:29] <arschmitz> agcolom: just ping me when you have time again and github is working :)
[14:42:37] <agcolom> sure :-)
[14:42:40] <agcolom> Thanks!
