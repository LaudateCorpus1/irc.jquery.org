[04:32:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Ping!
[04:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ping
[04:51:49] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: pong
[04:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> Got time to go over QUnit + AMD?
[04:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> I think we can make a bunch of progress after my grunt-contrib-qunit PR since you have push access.
[04:53:06] <jzaefferer> okay
[04:53:17] <jzaefferer> I can even make QUnit releases :p
[04:53:33] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: has ALL THE ACCESS!
[04:56:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What's up?
[04:57:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: get a chance to look at that textinput test that was failing with new autoinit
[04:57:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i got the others figured out and fixed still stumped by that one
[05:06:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I was trying to run grunt test on that branch but I'm getting failures left and right.
[05:07:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I have 48b6c7fffb05e2bd0b1a81ce206aa536ef6fba33 as the HEAD of 1.5-enhancer. Is that correct.
[05:07:27] <gabriel_schulhof> ?
[05:08:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, I'm getting failures with collapsible and stuff. Lots of failures.
[05:08:41] <arschmitz> just a sec checking
[05:09:30] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: pull and try now
[05:10:07] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[05:10:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you should then have 0dd93f44096c256e0ca7958f1289e453f43658be
[05:11:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[05:11:23] <gabriel_schulhof> Testing now.
[05:11:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: related i talked to scott_gonzalez yesterday about getting our test helpers in line with the ui ones their domEual gives diffs
[05:11:49] <arschmitz> massive horrible diffs but diffs
[05:11:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[05:12:03] <arschmitz> and its a real assertion now too
[05:12:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[05:12:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1511
[05:12:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Maybe we should have a repo ...
[05:12:58] <arschmitz> we will probably use a good chunk of that pr in mobile
[05:13:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we generally just publish them under one of our own names
[05:13:32] <arschmitz> like qunit-assert-classes
[05:13:34] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15scottgonzalez pushed 2 new commits to 06amd-tests: 02http://git.io/jyCJ
[05:13:34] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06amd-tests 14eddd999 15Scott Gonz√°lez: [fixup]: rename common tests
[05:13:34] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06amd-tests 14e79f763 15Scott Gonz√°lez: [fixup]: domEqual context
[05:13:58] <arschmitz> that started as a ui testhelper ( just never made it to master ) because we wanted it for mobile
[05:15:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, but if we're gonna use the same test helpers, maybe we should make a repo with test helpers.
[05:15:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Of course, I'm not sure how that's gonna jive with moving to intern.
[05:15:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: intern supports the qunit api
[05:16:18] <gabriel_schulhof> I guess that's the answer for now.
[05:17:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the problem with making them foundation things
[05:17:42] <arschmitz> is then we have to support for ever
[05:18:06] <arschmitz> and if we do lets say move to intern we would probably slowly stop using qunit plugins and would not want to support them any more
[05:18:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, can't we have internal repos? I mean ... not every foundation repo has to produce a marketable product - does it?
[05:19:24] <arschmitz> but why i mean these are useful things to the general public i mean checking dom equality can be pretty useful
[05:19:32] <arschmitz> or class equality
[05:19:55] <arschmitz> just because the foundation does not want to support forever does not mean it should not be a thing
[05:19:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, that's true, but if we don't want to support them, we could say use at your risk. I mean we say that about $.support.
[05:20:09] <arschmitz> bad policy
[05:20:35] <arschmitz> that does not build trust
[05:20:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, OK. Still, we should try not to be ad-hoc about these repos - in or out of the Foundation.
[05:20:44] <gabriel_schulhof> You're right.
[05:21:04] <arschmitz> whats wrong with using a repo published by an individual
[05:21:19] <arschmitz> tons and tons and tons of things we depend on through npm are individuals
[05:21:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Nothing, as long as they don't proliferate unnecessarily.
[05:21:51] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: look at scott_gonzalez or jzaefferer github repos some time and see how many we use in some form
[05:22:02] <gabriel_schulhof> If it makes sense that two things should go into the same repo, then they should be in one repo.
[05:22:30] <arschmitz> im not sure what you mean by that
[05:22:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, completely. I'm just thinking that, for example, qunit-assert-classes could be made part of a larger repo where domEquals could also reside.
[05:22:52] <arschmitz> why
[05:22:54] <gabriel_schulhof> So, like, qunit-dom-assertions.
[05:22:56] <arschmitz> what if you dont want both
[05:23:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: assertion plugins are generally fairly specific in their use http://qunitjs.com/plugins/
[05:24:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, bower will continue to allow us to pull individual files, but I guess it doesn't matter where you retrieve from - whether it's one repo or multiple.
[05:25:04] <arschmitz> yup
[05:28:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Weird ... in that test, the input has a bunch of classes after it's destroyed.
[05:28:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, no, wait ... the original has a bunch of classes.
[05:29:13] <gabriel_schulhof> The original is enhanced.
[05:29:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: #destroy-test has data-nstest-role="none", so it should not be enhanced.
[05:30:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Why does this work in Chrome?
[05:32:00] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm an idiot. It doesn't work in Chrome either. I was running it from jquery/ not from arschmitz/ ... *slap forehead*
[05:36:07] <arschmitz> ohhhhh
[05:36:14] <arschmitz> ok i see now
[05:36:18] <arschmitz> i removed that lol
[05:36:27] <arschmitz> data-role="none"
[05:36:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, subject to $.mobile.ns
[05:37:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thank you
[05:37:07] <gabriel_schulhof> NP.
[05:37:15] <arschmitz> yeah the namespace is fine that work
[05:37:34] <arschmitz> i just removed support for data-role="none"
[05:37:42] <gabriel_schulhof> One of our many ways of indicating that enhancement is to be skipped :/
[05:37:59] <arschmitz> one of the many deprecated ways lol
[05:37:59] <gabriel_schulhof> We really need to streamline that.
[05:38:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[05:38:14] <arschmitz> im pulling all that out into backcompat
[05:38:28] <gabriel_schulhof> :+1.0e6:
[05:40:13] <arschmitz> now that i have everything passing im moving to adding backcompat 
[05:41:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Don't forget to if ( $.mobileBackcompat ) it.
[05:41:52] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll BBL ...
[06:53:52] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: re: massive horrible diffs but diffs; At least the QUnit team is working on improving the output :-)
[08:01:52] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yup iv talked to jzaefferer quite a bit about it
