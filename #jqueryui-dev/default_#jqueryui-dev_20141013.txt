[12:28:55] <ldeluca> any css experts here?
[12:49:50] <arschmitz> ldeluca: im not an expert but might be able to help
[12:51:47] <ldeluca> arschmitz: So I've been looking into this issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6582
[12:51:55] <ldeluca> arschmitz: and have been able to reproduce.  I narrowed down where the problem is
[12:52:17] <ldeluca> arschmitz: and if I comment out the css transformations then no scroll bars are shown and obvious no cool transformations either
[12:52:39] <arschmitz> ok
[12:54:02] <arschmitz> so my instinct is that this is likely a chrome bug we wont be able to work around 
[12:54:13] <arschmitz> ldeluca: since this only happens in phonegap
[12:55:18] <ldeluca> arschmitz: okay, so do we close and suggest they file against chrome since we narrowed it down to css transformations?
[12:55:21] <arschmitz> or wait no you said you can reproduce without phonegap or cordova right?
[12:57:53] <arschmitz> ldeluca: is that correct?
[12:58:16] <ldeluca> in browserstack. not on a physical device
[12:58:26] <arschmitz> ldeluca: ok 
[12:58:34] <arschmitz> ldeluca: im seeing a lot on google about this
[12:58:39] <arschmitz> its an android bug it looks like
[12:58:45] <arschmitz> ldeluca: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/graphics-dev/OSHUzdGV-_k
[12:58:55] <arschmitz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16469548/overflowhidden-not-working-with-translation-in-positive-direction
[12:59:10] <arschmitz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20662834/overflow-hidden-border-radius-and-transform-in-android-browser
[12:59:22] <ldeluca> arschmitz: yea, i saw similar as well
[12:59:26] <arschmitz> https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=25499
[12:59:32] <arschmitz> so there is already an open bug
[12:59:58] <arschmitz> maybe just add a comment about this effecting jquery mobile transitions 
[13:00:04] <arschmitz> to try to get some attention
[13:00:05] <ldeluca> arschmitz: okay, i'll add that to the comment section in the bug and suggest we close
[13:00:40] <arschmitz> ldeluca: awesome thank you if you want to or i can we should also comment on the chrome bug itself and star it
[13:01:26] <arschmitz> ldeluca: oh heh its one of our team members that opened the issue though they dont work on mobile
[13:01:47] <ldeluca> arschmitz: on it! :)
[13:01:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey! Do we still support jQuery 1.8.3?
[13:02:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Or rather, will we as of 1.5.0?
[13:03:15] <arschmitz> most likely unless there is a reason not to
[13:04:08] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[13:04:26] <gabriel_schulhof> I have a reviewed table test that fails, but only under 1.8.3 ... very weird.
[13:04:54] <arschmitz> ldeluca: ill ping some people at google on it too we have a couple people probably a bug in core
[13:04:57] <arschmitz> that was fixed
[13:05:03] <arschmitz> oops gabriel_schulhof^^
[13:05:27] <arschmitz> lol first half of that was for ldeluca second for gabriel_schulhof :)
[13:05:31] <Omar-> hi arschmitz gabriel_schulhof
[13:05:38] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and only in phantom.
[13:06:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well core does not officially support phantom
[13:06:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: in fact cores tests explicitly do not currently pass in phantom
[13:06:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i was trying to fix that at the conf but have been side tracked since
[13:07:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, things work fine on all other versions of core, so I dunno why this one test fails. I'll track it down and maybe use another method to do the same thing that does not fail.
[13:07:32] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: sounds good
[13:08:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that pr you commented on about custom select thats ian from app mobi / intel app framework
[13:08:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, NM ... fails in Chrome too ...
[13:08:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I know.
[13:15:00] <Omar-> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7774
[13:15:23] <Omar-> this doesn't fix #7732
[13:17:11] <arschmitz> Omar-: ok thank you
[13:17:29] <Omar-> you're welcome
[13:18:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I know why it fails on 1.8.3: It's because I end up calling .removeClass( undefined ), which in 1.8.3 is treated the same as .removeClass() - i.e., arguments.length is not taken into account.
[13:18:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The problem is with the test case.
