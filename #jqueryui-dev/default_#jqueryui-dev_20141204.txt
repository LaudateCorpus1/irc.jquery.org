[09:43:33] <aftab> Hello, on a mobile html5 app how do I make jquery recognize taps on two different buttons at the same time please? I am using hammer.js with it and on("tap") it works for one button but when I tap on both buttons it doesn't work also when I touch and hold one button and click on another it doesn't work 
[09:43:44] <aftab> please let me know what to use for touch events to call functions on each button tap even if another is already being tapped
[09:53:27] <scott_gonzalez> aftab: Support is in #jquery.
[10:04:21] <aftab> I have been redirected here when I tried to join #jquerymobile-dev :(
[10:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: is categories.json from api.jqueryui.com used by download builder?
[10:26:52] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, it is: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/545e685de073f4e1e2133025cf8da728b0e4449d/Gruntfile.js#L382
[10:27:02] <rxaviers> you found it
[10:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> Is it actually used for anything?
[10:27:24] <rxaviers> this file was familiar. But, I was searching where it was used.
[10:27:38] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like the list of categories is actually hardcoded: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/f8327f2108cda179722bf1527775983e49986618/lib/jquery-ui.js#L10
[10:28:06] <rxaviers> I guess it is.
[10:28:12] <rxaviers> I can check it and let you know
[10:28:18] <rxaviers> in a couple of mins
[10:28:31] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ping!
[10:28:41] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: Pong!
[10:28:47] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: hey!
[10:29:07] <arschmitz> Hi
[10:29:15] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: in my button css branch there is an issue with data-icon
[10:29:52] <arschmitz> it needs to be the whole class now not just the icon name
[10:30:06] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Thanks. I'd like to remove the task that generates that file if we're not actually using it for anything.
[10:30:17] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ah you fixed it in ui-1-12 branch?
[10:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'll check the history to see when it was added. That might provide some info.
[10:30:45] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, no info: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commit/21703a3fd93243b7616633fb4baf33aa07092c40
[10:31:02] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: huh no thats just a difference between the new and old widgets it used to be just the icon name with out ui-icon now it needs to be the full class name
[10:31:34] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: not sure if I understand
[10:31:35] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: It was used in 1.10: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/f8327f2108cda179722bf1527775983e49986618/lib/jquery-ui-files-1-10.js#L75
[10:32:30] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: in my branch it adds "ui-button-icon ui-icon home"
[10:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'm not sure what the docs categories are used for inside DB though.
[10:32:47] <arschmitz> right
[10:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: And if it was only in 1.10, seems like we should be good to remove it in master.
[10:33:08] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: shouldn't that be "ui-icon-home"?
[10:33:11] <arschmitz> because it should be data-icon="ui-icon-home" not data-icon="home"
[10:33:28] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ah ok
[10:34:12] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: will change the data- attribute values then
[10:34:23] <arschmitz> sounds good
[10:36:54] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: you said the double borders between buttons in controlgroups will stay in UI because otherwise focus state looks bad
[10:37:23] <arschmitz> yes
[10:37:26] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: you can resolve that with z-index: 1
[10:38:05] <jasperdegroot> for .ui-controlgroup .ui-button:focus
[10:38:10] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, you're correct. That's the only place it's been used. It's not used anymore on 1.11.
[10:38:27] <rxaviers> So, it won't be needed after 1.10 is not served anymore on DB.
[10:38:37] <rxaviers> by*
[10:38:48] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: and position relative to make z-index work if ui-button doesn't have that already
[10:39:30] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: its also part of how ui looks to begin with http://jqueryui.com/button/#splitbutton
[10:40:01] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I see
[10:40:07] <arschmitz> personally i think it looks better that way
[10:40:47] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: with a split button and the background image it looks a bit like a groove, that looks ok
[10:41:12] <jasperdegroot> with flat buttons it looks a bit odd IMHO
[10:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: So is 1.10 using the manifest task from master or from the 1-10 branch?
[10:41:38] <scott_gonzalez> I assume from the 1-10 branch, which means we can remove the task today.
[10:41:40] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: anyways, in Mobile I make it look the same as in 1.4 (single border)
[10:41:50] <arschmitz> thats fine
[10:41:51] <rxaviers> the tagged 1.10.4 has the manifest built in
[10:41:57] <rxaviers> manifests*
[10:42:17] <rxaviers> but, it's from the tagged.
[10:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, I meant categories.json. The task that builds it is called manifest.
[10:42:38] <rxaviers> ah sorry
[10:42:41] <scott_gonzalez> from api.jqueryui.com
[10:42:47] <rxaviers> from 1-10 branch, correc.
[10:42:50] <rxaviers> correct*
[10:43:31] <scott_gonzalez> perfect
[10:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
