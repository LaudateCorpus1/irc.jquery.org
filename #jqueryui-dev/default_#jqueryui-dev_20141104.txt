[05:55:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping! The old controlgroup respected keepNative. The new one does not, but I guess the dev can add $.mobile.keepNative to the selectors in the items option.
[05:55:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah and since keepnative is deprecated in 1.5 also
[05:56:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OKOK, but it must still be respected in 1.5, just not in 1.6, right?
[05:56:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I was even thinking: Do we need the controlgroup tests at all? I mean, it is now an external widget.
[05:56:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no i just missed removing them
[05:57:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... but the fact that we've had the controlgroup tests and that some now fail points out that the new widget behaves differently from the old.
[05:57:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Is this difference in behaviour something we can introduce without a deprecation period?
[05:57:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: not nessasarrily
[05:57:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: our tests make assumptions
[05:58:10] <arschmitz> that are not part of the api
[05:58:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah. They assume that data-role="none" protects an element from enhancement.
[05:58:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: even aside from that
[05:58:53] <arschmitz> we assume certain classes that are not going to be true
[05:59:04] <arschmitz> we stub functions that are private or may not be the same
[05:59:08] <arschmitz> but are not part of the api
[05:59:11] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I've already fixed that. Things like ui-button, not the old ui-btn
[05:59:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but regardless the tests should be removed
[05:59:52] <arschmitz> keep native is another issue
[05:59:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes.
[05:59:57] <arschmitz> that ill think about
[06:00:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, controlgroup tests should be gutted and confined to testing the backcompat behaviour, not removed entirely, because we do extend controlgroup at least in 1.5.
[06:01:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes we will need tests for all backcompat
[06:01:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but we should write new ones
[06:01:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and only for backcompat, in the case of controlgroup.
[06:01:30] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Good. I'll do that.
[06:03:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You can replace that.element.children( selector ) in _callChildMethod() with an extension point which can be overridden in mobile to take into account keepNative.
[06:03:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, _getChildren( selector )
[06:03:44] <gabriel_schulhof> So ... this._getChildren( selector )[ widget ]( method ? method : options );
[06:03:47] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we wont add an extension point thats only usefull for mobile backcompat
[06:03:59] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[06:04:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Good point.
[06:04:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Then the backcompat shall consist of processing the items option on _create() and _setOptions(), adding keepNative.
[06:04:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The interesting part will be avoiding adding it twice.
[06:05:15] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: the note looks good to me (https://cloudup.com/cwZDjZPyZdy). Only thing I'd change is this part: notation, e.g., "foo.bar" -> notation. For example, "foo.bar"
[06:05:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im inclined to not provide backcompat since its being removed anyway in the same version its not like its being replaced with something else really
[06:05:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah. It'd be complicated.
[06:05:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so theres not a real upgrade path
[06:05:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its just not supported any more
[06:06:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ... and it can't really be implemented alongside the new functionality either - at least, not cleanly.
[06:06:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so keeping the old behivor for another version will not help the upgrade path
[06:06:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It may actually not have that big an impact. I doubt a lot of people go to the trouble of constructing a controlgroup only to leave some of its children unenhanced.
[06:06:42] <arschmitz> because there is no real upgrade path
[06:06:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: exactly
[06:10:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, if I remove the assumption about keepNative, tests/integration/controlgroup tests whether the controlgroup enhances its children. The UI test already tests that, so our test can now officially be removed.
[06:13:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Why do we refresh the controlgroup upon pagecontainershow?
[06:14:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We didn't use to.
[06:14:02] <arschmitz> cant test visable until its visible
[06:14:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh. The new controlgroup needs that it's visible?
[06:14:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Aaah, yes. There it is.
[06:15:15] <gabriel_schulhof> excludeVisible.
[06:15:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the current one does to through addFirstLastClasses
[06:17:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, addFirstLastClasses made the weak assumption that if called from _create() it looks only at class ui-screen-hidden to determine what is visible and what is not, and only uses :visible otherwise.
[06:18:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah thats more or less a hack though and enforces you to use a special class to hide
[06:18:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[06:19:44] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: I think you can close this one based on the comments https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4024
[06:21:04] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz closed issue #4024: White flash/flicker when transiting between 2 web pages in Phonegap  02http://git.io/cVGCPA
[06:33:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Do we need to unconditionally .filter( "*" ) in controlgroup's refresh() if excludeInvisible is false? I mean, the code is definitely shorter, but it seems like an extra operation.
[06:36:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ill see if it really makes a difference
[06:58:38] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: fyi, can't reproduce this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5575
[07:00:46] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz closed issue #5575: url bar partly visible on Android 2.3.4 02http://git.io/7e-qvQ
[07:00:53] <lisa_deluca> also, no idea what to do for this one.  For the life of me I couldn't reproduce https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5238  Maybe someone else has an older device to try to reproduce.  I can't get the 2.3.6 version on genymotion
[07:05:35] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: I have an issue for you to work on if you want
[07:05:47] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7821
[07:06:39] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: sure, thanks, i'll look today
[07:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ping
[07:36:08] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: I copied and pasted the code into a new file using the latest jqm and the issue doesn't exist
[07:36:18] <lisa_deluca> maybe someone else already fixed it?
[07:36:35] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: for what
[07:36:36] <arschmitz> ?
[07:36:43] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: for 7821
[07:36:57] <arschmitz> oh no thats a real issue
[07:37:14] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: its a regression from your commit to fix the focus outline
[07:37:40] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: this is using master http://jsbin.com/zuyapirepi/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:37:52] <lisa_deluca> okay, maybe my local doesn't ahve the latest then
[07:38:12] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: but pretty-diff master says no differences
[07:38:24] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: im confused
[07:38:31] <arschmitz> what are you diffing?
[07:38:47] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: my current branch against jquery mobile master
[07:38:57] <arschmitz> ok 
[07:39:24] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: so where are you trying to reproduce ?
[07:39:33] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: ah, let me copy and move the latest jqm... i thinkthat's my problem
[07:39:34] <lisa_deluca> one sec
[07:39:50] <arschmitz> ok
[07:40:08] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: if you didnt pull master recently it was a very recent commit that broke this
[07:40:42] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: sure enough, i see it now
[07:40:45] <lisa_deluca> okay, debugging
[07:41:11] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: no need to debug really
[07:41:22] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: the issue pretty much says the problem and the fix
[07:41:44] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: yea, i know :) that's what I meant, testing the fix
[07:42:05] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: you will want to go through all the form element pages and make sure nothing is broken
[07:42:14] <arschmitz> since you cant write a test for this 
[07:44:00] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: okay
[07:46:14] <lisa_deluca> are the demos really php files?!? it's been ages since i've seen a php file :)
[07:51:18] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15ldeluca opened pull request #7825: Forms: fixes regression bug from ui-mini fix. (06master...067821-minislider) 02http://git.io/0uIECw
[07:51:56] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: yes
[07:52:13] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: our websites are wordpress so also php
[07:52:48] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: the biggest thing you want to check is not so much that this issue is fixed
[07:53:06] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: that it doesn't break anything else
[07:53:07] <lisa_deluca> yet
[07:53:09] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: but that the commit that caused it is not also causing other issues with any other mini elements
[07:53:36] <lisa_deluca> yea, need to figure out how to setup my local environment to test php pages to view the demos locally
[07:53:47] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: the fix is confined to .ui-slider-track so it cant really break anything other then slider
[07:54:03] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: i use mamp personally
[07:54:12] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: but you dont actually need local demos to test this
[07:54:14] <lisa_deluca> right, but my original one might be breaking others that no one saw yet
[07:54:31] <arschmitz> you can check that here http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/
[07:54:47] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: oh yea :)
[07:55:18] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: i mean you should still get a local setup for doing sanity checks on other fixes when you work on them
[07:55:25] <arschmitz> but not needed for this particular issue

[10:03:14] <arschmitz> agcolom: no i dont plan on it
[10:03:15] <agcolom> (the mini slider issue)?
[10:03:23] <arschmitz> agcolom: no thats really minor
[10:03:32] <arschmitz> agcolom: you can fix it with one line of css
[10:04:05] <agcolom> right, yes, we could just supply the workaround on the github issue?
[10:04:45] <arschmitz> agcolom: its already there the reporter posted it
[10:05:00] <agcolom> oh, I missed it ;-) thx :-)
[10:05:55] <arschmitz> agcolom: no problem
[10:24:20] <lisa_deluca> anyone know how to take a jsfiddle page and make it so the result is the whole thing? 
[10:24:31] <lisa_deluca> like this one: http://jsfiddle.net/56EfU/3/
[10:24:33] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: you cant
[10:24:38] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: they removed that
[10:24:55] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: you can get it to be fullscreen with a toolbar but its still in an iframe
[10:25:16] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: thats why we use jsbin
[10:25:50] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: okay, thanks.  I was wondering if there was a secret I didn't know
[10:26:00] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: there used to be
[10:26:05] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: but they removed it
[10:45:20] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: know how to reference another github issue from a first issue?
[10:45:41] <arschmitz> yeah just use the issue number
[10:45:45] <arschmitz> like #5432

[11:08:31] <lisa_deluca> I can't reproduce with the latest jqm
[11:31:49] <lisa_deluca> is this normal: http://jsbin.com/index.html
[11:37:10] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: im gonna say no 
[11:37:22] <arschmitz> ill email remy the creator of jsbin
[11:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> lisa_deluca: How did you end up on index.html?
[11:40:56] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: i emailed him
[11:41:02] <lisa_deluca> accidentally had a page redirect to index.html
[11:41:16] <lisa_deluca> scott_gonzalez: on a test I was running
[11:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's not really hacked.
[11:41:27] <lisa_deluca> yea, the main page is okay
[11:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> *.html is just whatever bin has the id of *.
[11:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> So someone got index and you're just seeing the most recent version of it.

[12:36:57] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: am i crazy or is this issue how it's expected to work: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7623
[13:01:39] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: there are a bunch of problems there
[13:01:59] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: we have tried to fix them in the past with out much luck but i actually think i just found a workaround
[13:05:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Ping!
[13:39:09] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: wasn't able to reproduce this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5879 probably fixed since it was opened 1.5 years ago

[14:28:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What's up?
[14:39:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK ... you get a weird problem in Chrome: The button's refresh() method becomes undefined after you $.widget( "ui.button", $.ui.button, $.mobile.widget.theme );
[14:39:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... but only in Chrome!
[14:39:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It works in phantomjs and it works in FF.
[14:57:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that is odd ill look
[15:13:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, totally. I'll try to trace through it tomorrow. It looks like the inconsistency stems from the fact that $.mobile.widget.theme is undefined, because that AMD module does not depend on widget.theme.
[15:14:27] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I fixed it, but I'd still like to know why, if the third argument to $.widget is the value undefined, then it removes a method off the existing prototype.
[15:14:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, come to think of it, it may have worked in FF but not Chrome because of async load order.
[15:15:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, in FF, $.mobile.widget.theme was already there.
[15:17:31] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Is this expected behaviour? http://jsbin.com/zocey/1/
[15:20:26] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok so thats a mistake in the dependency declaration
[15:20:33] <arschmitz> thats simple enough
[15:21:17] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah. I was thinking though ... should a prototype /lose/ methods because you're extending it with undefined?
[15:21:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Hence my question to scott_gonzalez.

[16:10:48] <ufk> hello
[16:11:18] <ufk> i have an $.ajax().then(). the ajax is executed fine but the .then isn't being executed. any ideas why ?
[17:03:54] <scott_gonzalez> gabriel_schulhof: garbage in = garbage out :-)
[17:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> `$.widget( "abc.test", $.abc.test, undefined )` is the same as `$.widget( "abc.test", $.abc.test )`
[17:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> So think about what that means, in terms of extending vs. overwriting.
