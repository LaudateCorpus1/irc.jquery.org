[06:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: What's the deal with the dropdown option in selectmenu?
[06:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> It overrides a lot of behavior.
[06:20:42] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: The deal? As in, why do we have it?
[06:20:56] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> We've spent a lot of time figuring out how to create APIs that don't behave like this.
[06:22:46] <jzaefferer> I guess we can remove that, make the current dropdown:false the default, add the icons option and be done with it
[06:23:03] <jzaefferer> using icons and position the same result should be achievable
[06:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like there would need to be other extension points, because it changes the width of the menu too.
[06:24:01] <jzaefferer> yeah, and replaces ui-corner-all with ui-corner-bottom
[06:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> The other extension points may exist, I haven't looked.
[06:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> But I was trying to comment on the icons option and I couldn't because of dropdown.
[06:25:18] <jzaefferer> Okay, let's put the in the PR or on the wiki page
[06:25:37] <jzaefferer> I wonder if we should just create a new PR, the current one is getting rather unwieldy
[06:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> A new PR would be good. I can't even find 80% of the comments.
[06:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> Half the time I click on the "view on GitHub" link and it takes me nowhere.

[12:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta love <base> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6653292/using-jqueryui-accordion-navigationtrue-w-base-tag
[13:01:36] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I think it's time you start a campaign to educate all web developers once and for all what base is and how it works
[13:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> If there were to be a campaign, it'd be about why not to use it.
[13:02:50] <rworth> well there's that
[13:50:41] <Dave_Stein> i haven't used a base tag since my angelfire site in the 90s :D
