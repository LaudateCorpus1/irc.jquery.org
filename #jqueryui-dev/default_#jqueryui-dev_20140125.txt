[01:39:57] <_zoggy_> any plans for jqui to add multi colors to their progress bar? for example if the progress bar has 0 to 100. and its currently at 25, but your processing another 10 items.. it would be nice to show a tri color of something thats in progress..  
[01:41:31] <_zoggy_> stacked progress bar i guess is the proper name

[01:56:17] <_zoggy_> looks like bootstrap's progress bar would do what i want :/
[07:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: You should just build an extension.
[08:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> It's a pretty terrible comparison to say Bootstrap actually supports stacked progressbars.
[08:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> I can just as easily create a jQuery UI demo that has three divs with exact widths on them.

[10:07:41] <agcolom> anyone around to check my PR? ^ arschmitz uGoMobi _|Nix|_ 
[10:09:04] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi
[10:09:12] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[10:09:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: aren't these iframes that we can remove?
[10:09:41] <agcolom> yes, but I'd like to fix them first
[10:09:41] <uGoMobi> checkboxradio should work without iframe
[10:09:56] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[10:09:56] <agcolom> that will be the next step
[10:10:01] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[10:10:44] <agcolom> because it may take a bit of time... I'm still thinking about how to best do it and I am thinking of trying a couple of possibilities
[10:11:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I understand
[10:11:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: PR is good to go
[10:11:59] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[10:13:35] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we should not forget to cherry pick fixes like this into the 1-3 branch
[10:13:48] <agcolom> right... 
[10:14:01] <agcolom> I'm not too sure how to do that...
[10:14:16] <agcolom> I need to land the PR first, right?
[10:14:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: correct
[10:14:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: just land the commit in master
[10:14:53] <agcolom> then checkout 1-3 and cherry-pick? 
[10:15:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[10:15:21] <agcolom> I might wait until gseguin is around... to be sure... unless you know the commands?
[10:15:56] <agcolom> because I'll need also to tag and deploy 1-3 after that
[10:16:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I know the command but I remember gseguin is always saying we should use a certain flag 
[10:16:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: so let's ask him or scott_gonzalez first before cherry-picking
[10:16:57] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: could we add a few things to your "how to land a PR"?
[10:17:09] <agcolom> document
[10:17:32] <agcolom> so: how to cherry-pick the landed PR into another branch (e.g. 1-3) 
[10:18:18] <agcolom> and also how to tag and deploy that other branch (e.g. 1-3) and then how to tag and deploy the current branch (master)
[10:18:42] <uGoMobi> I think gseguin was talking about the -x flag
[10:19:11] <agcolom> I don't know that one??

[10:28:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it seems useful to use -x but let's check with the experts
[10:31:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: to cherry pick you do "$ git checkout 1-3" and then "$ git cherry-pick d6820b0" OR "$ git cherry-pick -x d6820b0"
[10:57:45] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom uGoMobi: Yes, all cherry-picks from master to a versioned branch uses `git cherry-pick -x`.
[11:02:57] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ok, will use -x. thanks

[12:39:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[12:39:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[12:39:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you're there ... setting height to 0 before calculating desired textarea height is what's breaking IE8.
[12:39:46] <_|Nix|_> I guess you're there :)
[12:39:56] <uGoMobi> good guess :)
[12:40:18] <_|Nix|_> Not sure how to detect against that.
[12:40:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm
[12:45:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think it's FF that's giving us all this headache. The fact that heights are calculated incorrectly in FF is what caused us to go through all this trouble.
[12:45:52] <_|Nix|_> However, if we turn off scrollbars, and we ensure that content is never offscreen - meaning the height is good enough, then we shouldn't need to worry so much.
[12:50:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll do a git blame on why we added the set-height-to-0 line. I think it was for the FF fix.
[12:50:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, typical case of fix one browser, break another :(
[12:53:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. The set-to-0 was added in b4d51581bb245e409ed6a2925f2716613bd29d64 to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6179
[12:55:41] <_|Nix|_> We can't do this via set-height-to-0 without breaking IE8 :(
[12:58:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe I can do some feature detection on the textarea ... it's just shy of browser-sniffing :/
[13:03:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what feature are you going to detect?
[13:04:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: or do you just mean add something like if ( !$.mobile.browser.oldIE >= 8 ) {... } in the autogrow extension
[13:04:57] <uGoMobi> ?
[13:20:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, I mean I'm going to find some properties that only IE8 textareas have.
[13:20:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have to go now.
