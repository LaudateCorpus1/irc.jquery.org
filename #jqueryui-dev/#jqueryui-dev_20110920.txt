[08:44:59] <jzaefferer> gnarf: try https://github.com/defunkt/hub and add an alias `fork = remote add -f`
[08:45:19] <jzaefferer> then you just do `git fork rxaviers` and it adds the remote and fetches it
[08:45:34] <jzaefferer> supa useful :-)
[08:59:50] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers, apart from the remaining fraction PR, is there anything else you're still working on? looking for a new challenge?
[09:00:03] <jzaefferer> you already unlocked the Menu and Position achievements ;)
[09:00:18] <kborchers> heh
[09:01:07] <kborchers> i need to do some updating of the menu wiki ... need someone to take a look at my input menu extension and give feedback/thoughts/suggestions and add a placeholder demo that links to my demo
[09:01:18] <kborchers> other than that, definitely up for a new challenge :)
[09:02:50] <kborchers> i was actually going to start looking through the wiki for something to work on but if you have something in mind that needs work, i'm ready
[09:07:58] <jzaefferer> well, input menu is interesting, but not a priority for 1.9, so I'd rather shift focus to something else
[09:08:36] <jzaefferer> close by is menubar, which is somewhat halfbaked - got ARIA in, but some API weirdness (buttons and something options) and needs general code cleanup and polish
[09:09:52] <kborchers> i can definitely jump on that. are the todo's up to date? if so, i'll just start there
[09:12:35] <jzaefferer> yeah, TODO list looks up to date
[09:12:42] <jzaefferer> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/38666403/Menubar
[09:12:53] <jzaefferer> take a look, let me know if those need clarifiction
[09:12:59] <jzaefferer> *clarification
[09:13:15] <jzaefferer> you may want to get familiar with Popup, too: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/39506002/Popup
[09:13:21] <jzaefferer> that also needs some love
[09:14:59] <kborchers> not sure about "Figure out API for setting top-level menu position and submenu position" is that related to "Add option orientation: vertical|horizontal" or something else?
[09:15:35] <jzaefferer> was intended to be related, but could be in the end
[09:16:06] <jzaefferer> the todo is about customizing the positioning of menus - top level are those opening when you click on the menubar itself, submenus anything below those
[09:16:19] <jzaefferer> the position-configuration is different for those two
[09:17:19] <jzaefferer> and currently more or less hardcoded for the submenus (line 47)
[09:17:43] <jzaefferer> reusing the within part of options.position...
[09:22:15] <kborchers> ok, i'll take a look through the code and see if i get a better understanding and let you know if i have other questions.
[09:22:39] <kborchers> the first todo is a question. is that the way we want to go? if so, should i maybe start with popup before menubar?
[09:52:00] <jzaefferer> kborchers: yeah, makes sense
[09:52:18] <jzaefferer> you are still not really available for calls, right?
[10:00:44] <kborchers> yeah, not really during the day.
[10:00:53] <jzaefferer> wwalser: could you take a look at these? http://jquery.github.com/qunit/addons/composite/composite-demo-test.html
[10:01:13] <jzaefferer> kborchers: and only late in the evening?
[10:01:34] <jzaefferer> I know, we've been there before, maybe next week when I'm on EDT...
[10:02:29] <kborchers> could maybe do really early morning if i set it up with the wife to handle the baby before work.
[10:02:51] <kborchers> you coming over early? when you getting to Boston? I'll be in Friday morning
[11:09:08] <jzaefferer> I'll be in Boston Friday afternoon, a few days of Florida before that (flying there on Sunday)
[11:10:45] <kborchers> Nice! Enjoy!
[11:12:17] <kborchers> I'm doing the tourist thing on Friday (eating lots of seafood, maybe check out Fenway, etc.). Not sure about Friday night though. Just waiting to see who all will be there and what everyone is doing
[11:13:04] <kborchers> I know gnarf will be around that day too. He's getting there on Wednesday, i think
[12:16:06] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 3 new commits to grid-observable: http://git.io/451Alg

[12:16:06] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid-observable] Grid: Revert to binding to change events on objects directly, adding this to both the grid and the (app demoing) localstore - Jörn Zaefferer
[12:35:03] <gnarf> yup wed
[13:04:40] <jzaefferer> gnarf: saw the hub thingie?
[13:04:59] <gnarf> yeah - thats useful - haven't installed it yet
[13:08:04] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to grid-observable: http://git.io/ZSE1iQ
[13:08:04] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid-observable] Grid: Update totalCount before calling replaceAll, so that event listeners see the updated totalCount, not a stale one - Jörn Zaefferer
[13:19:07] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to grid-observable: http://git.io/9Y9-OA
[13:19:07] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid-observable] Grid: replace datasource.toArray() with datasource.result, to make clear the array is mutable and the reference is staying the same - Jörn Zaefferer
[13:20:42] <gnarf> nice
[13:20:45] <gnarf> thats pretty useful
[13:22:54] <kborchers> note to self: next time someone comes to me to finish a project that someone else started, make sure they didn't use that piece of shit jQuery Tools library before accepting the job and then having to rebuild the whole thing
[13:23:36] <rpflo> That's a pile.
[13:29:08] <jzaefferer> kborchers: haha
[13:29:25] <jzaefferer> sounds mean
[13:30:39] <kborchers> jzaefferer: just spent a couple of hours trying to figure out why adding the metadata plugin to the project caused it to just implode on itself ... jQuery Tools
[13:31:35] <kborchers> worst part is the page i'm working on doesn't even need that library, they just include it on every damn page in the template!!
[13:31:45] <kborchers> it's a mess
[13:33:48] <jzaefferer> +1
[13:34:20] <jzaefferer> I'm now going to rename datasource to dataview - there are just 71 matches… :/
[13:38:38] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to grid: http://git.io/HBHxNA
[13:38:38] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Grid: Rename datasource to dataview - Jörn Zaefferer

[14:27:24] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Hello Jörn, I've posted a comment with the table demo. Please, just let me know how does that accomodate the grid-edit needs
[14:27:55] <rxaviers> one thing I think is still missing is a way to parameterize the startEvent (which currently is click) to whatever user wants
[14:28:10] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: thanks! will take a look sometime soon
[14:28:17] <rxaviers> cool thks
[17:34:54] <wwalser> jzaefferer: I'll take a look at those at some point. I've been a bit busy of late. I suspect that the tests are failing because of the way that it uses logging callbacks.
