[07:39:37] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 2 new commits to 1-8-stable: http://git.io/NgS3Xw
[07:39:37] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Tagging the 1.8.17 release. - Scott Gonz치lez
[07:39:37] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Updating the 1-8-stable version to 1.8.18pre - Scott Gonz치lez
[11:44:04] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: lol @ "Really, please stop using this ticket." I was thinking the same thing as all of the e-mails kept coming in.
[11:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:45:38] <bot-t> (134 hours ago) <kborchers> tell scott_gonzalez Opera 11 on 1-8-stable looks good other than a few things I found that also don't work in the current demos so nothing new is broken
[11:45:38] <bot-t> (133 hours ago) <kborchers> tell scott_gonzalez Safari is all good on 1-8-stable except tabs unit test #30 fails but it was failing in the last version too
[11:46:42] <scott_gonzalez> heh, 130+ hours ago...
[11:46:48] <kborchers> :)
[11:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> I actually saw those while I was on whatever skype call I was on at the time
[11:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> and I tagged 1.8.17 earlier today :-)
[11:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> just waiting on the Google CDN, as always
[11:48:16] <kborchers> yeah, i saw that
[11:48:44] <kborchers> planning on doing some menu work tonight as long as a client doesn't call ... which would be a miracle
[11:48:44] <scott_gonzalez> OMG, BrowserStack is amazing
[11:49:02] <scott_gonzalez> you can switch which browser you're using and it will go to the same URL when it launches the new VM
[11:49:12] <kborchers> inorite!
[11:49:19] <scott_gonzalez> even if you're currently on a different URL than the one you started on
[11:49:32] <kborchers> i'm a big fan of tunneling to your localhost too!
[11:51:10] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, that's what I'm doing right now, and bouncing through all the versions of IE to see which are affected by a CSS bug
[11:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> the default button demo looks like crap in IE
[11:53:41] <kborchers> really? all IE's?
[11:53:48] * kborchers looks
[11:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, well at least 6,7,8
[11:54:02] <scott_gonzalez> didn't get to 9
[11:54:11] <scott_gonzalez> because 8 didn't have the CSS bug I was looking at
[11:54:39] <kborchers> looking at 9 now and seems fine
[11:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> in lower versions, the buttons aren't even close to being vertically aligned
[11:55:51] <scott_gonzalez> especially the third button
[11:56:30] <kborchers> pulling up a 7 vm now
[11:57:03] <kborchers> nice :/
[11:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> hah, Firefox just updated to 8.0.1 and was all up in my face about disabling plugins to make Firefox faster
[12:03:01] * kborchers kicks self for starting IE7 VM while browserstack stares him in the face on the other monitor
[12:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> where's jqcommit?
[12:04:00] <kborchers> probably making out with bot-t somewhere
[12:04:21] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #177: STILL FAILING in 1 min 56 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/177/
[12:04:22] <jq-jenkins> Scott Gonz치lez: Button: Apply overflow: hidden in all browsers except IE 6,7 to avoid expanding the size of the button from negative text indent. Fixes #7911 - Button: icon only button in dialog causes horizontal scrollbar in Opera.
[12:05:27] <scott_gonzalez> stupid menu
[12:07:04] <kborchers> how do i see the most recent job on swarm?
[12:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/
[12:19:50] <kborchers> thanks
[12:20:55] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah ... the menu unit tests are a mess. that's on my todo list. need to fix broken ones and probably add a bunch more
[12:21:31] <scott_gonzalez> I think someone has Chrome connected in an inactive tab
[12:22:07] <kborchers> how's that? i was on swarm.jquery.org but not running tests
[12:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=2943&client_id=2547
[12:22:36] <scott_gonzalez> that shouldn't be failing
[12:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> the only reason it would fail is if the timeouts are all messed up
[12:22:55] <scott_gonzalez> which would happen in an inactive tab
[12:23:17] <scott_gonzalez> there was also an error in the effects tests
[12:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> which would be related to the same thing
[12:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> I connected and they ran fine
[12:23:56] <kborchers> hmm, i wasn't running tests so not sure what happened
[12:24:06] <kborchers> maybe someone else?
[12:26:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure it's someone else
[12:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> woohoo, success:
[12:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> As always, you are right. But understanding 'things' is always less frustrating than simply accepting them.
[12:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> Thank you, Scott, for demonstrating the patience needed to help me rest my mind on this case.
[12:27:48] <kborchers> heh
[12:27:57] <kborchers> "As always..."
