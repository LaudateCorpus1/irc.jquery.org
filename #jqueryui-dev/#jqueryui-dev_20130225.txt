[04:24:58] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, do you think TR should add one check for this https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/115 ? It seems to me a user error...
[04:24:58] <b-ot> rxaviers: Issue #115 by thenickdude (1d 4h ago): jQuery UI 1.8-era ThemeRoller link causes 500 Internal Server error
[04:25:43] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, good to go? https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/113
[04:25:43] <b-ot> rxaviers: Pull request #113 by rxaviers (2d 22h ago): Render rollYourOwn template of the themeroller page on frontend
[04:26:56] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: regarding #115, his URL was likely generated by an old version of TR, so I wouldn't consider that a user error. If there's a simple fix we can implement, let's do that. If its complicated, then bad luck and hope that not a lot of other people have that problem
[04:27:22] <jzaefferer> I can test #113 now
[04:27:27] <rxaviers> No, I think old TR didnt validade his error of not filling that color
[04:28:04] <rxaviers> I dont think it would produce such wrong querystring... Would it?
[04:28:12] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: if there's a default value, can we just use that if the param is present but has no value?
[04:28:29] <jzaefferer> http://old.jqueryui.com/themeroller/ is still online
[04:28:49] <rxaviers> mm.. I do use the default value if the attribute is not present. But, I dont validade each value to revert it to the default if wrong.
[04:29:30] <rxaviers> Is that worth checking? Because, normally a user should not have a wrong url/querystring...
[04:48:57] <jzaefferer> Guess not. Let's keep that in mind though. If someone else reports the same issue, its even less likely a user error
[04:58:46] <rxaviers> makes total sense ;)
[05:14:27] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: testing rollyourown_frontend. Npm fails to install glob-whatev/0.2.7, any idea what's up with that?
[05:14:44] <rxaviers> let me check
[05:14:54] <jzaefferer> https://npmjs.org/package/glob-whatev says latest is 0.1.8
[05:15:02] <rxaviers> ohoh.. we should have 0.1.7
[05:15:10] <rxaviers> 0.2.7 was my sniff test
[05:15:18] <rxaviers> did I commit it by mistake? af
[05:15:22] <jzaefferer> looks like that
[05:15:46] <jzaefferer> here: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/commit/fe9f9e10c8bafb8da811981dd7a681ef0e99fe31#diff-2
[05:15:46] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Rafael Xavier de Souza (3d 15h ago): Render themeroller rollyourown template on frontend  - Split rollYourOwn groups into its own partials, reducing the overall template   HTML; - Backend serves the rollYourOwnObject so frontend can render (TODO: move this   logic to frontend as well);
[05:15:53] <rxaviers> fixing..
[05:16:14] <jzaefferer> go to 0.1.8 though?
[05:16:18] <rxaviers> ok
[05:16:23] <rxaviers> previously it was 0.1.7
[05:16:40] <rxaviers> but we can update ok.
[05:16:49] <rxaviers> or use ~0.1.0?
[05:17:11] <rxaviers> would make it stick with latest 0.1.x right?

[05:26:59] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: usually fixed versions are preferrable, since semver is just an idea, not a gurantee. Also, in this case it would've been enough to just add commit (instead of rebase/force push), since we'll want to squash these two commits later anyway, right?

[05:29:04] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: copied the tests from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/04a50ff49f343e2e64d44830ff98abdcbbb78ed7 into master_tests and now they're failing
[05:29:04] <b-ot> mikesherov: Dave Stein (12h 40m ago): Draggable: Changed the way `handle` and `exclude` is detected
[05:29:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, sure, I could just add this commit for now, than squash later.. But, I wouldn't like to squash  both original commits, because they separate hold two interesting states.
[05:29:33] <rxaviers> first commit: rendering happens on client. But, the full JSON object is made on server.
[05:29:48] <rxaviers> second commit: rendering happens on client as well as the JSON creation.
[05:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: General concept is be flexible in versions for modules, strict in versions for apps.
[05:30:06] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, good to know.
[05:30:10] <rxaviers> ;)
[05:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> But for a lot of common jQuery stuff, we're strict in versions for modules too.
[05:30:26] <rxaviers> So, I will make sure we are using strict for all packages.
[05:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> But the idea is that if you're building something for others to use as a module, you want to be lenient to avoid multiple versions of deep dependencies
[05:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> If you're building an app, you want to make sure your production code is running with versions you've tested :-)
[05:32:01] <scott_gonzalez> Of course there's always the chance that a deep dependency will change on you even in production.
[05:32:14] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why some people commit their node_modules.
[05:32:35] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: server crashes, lack of imagemagick I guess? https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/14b33fc85ed2560a667a if so, that needs to be added on the README. Which probably lacks in other places as well, for example the prepare task doesn't take arguments
[05:33:49] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: also, without the `â€”console` argument it shows "Server is running atâ€¦" message, then stops. Annoying at best...
[05:34:04] <rxaviers> :)
[05:34:39] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: so how do I get my server running again?
[05:34:46] <jzaefferer> that is, the `node server.js` command
[05:34:47] <rxaviers> node server.js --console
[05:35:07] <rxaviers> Yeap jzaefferer, I need to update the README and remove the prepare argument.
[05:35:08] <jzaefferer> I ran that, it crashes with the gisted exception
[05:35:14] <rxaviers> let me check
[05:35:23] <jzaefferer> thanks
[05:35:55] <rxaviers> mm have not seen that so far  :/. But, some checks
[05:36:03] <rxaviers> have you npm update && npm install first?
[05:36:38] <rxaviers> DB/TR uses image magick. It checks if it's installed and in the correct version when initialized.
[05:37:15] <jzaefferer> I ran `npm install`, yeah
[05:37:39] <jzaefferer> tring npm update
[05:39:20] <rxaviers> ok yeap I imagined, but just to double check
[05:39:50] <jzaefferer> no difference
[05:40:28] <rxaviers> what do you get running `convert --version` /
[05:40:35] <rxaviers> in your terminal
[05:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I agree that we shouldn't handle this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9119
[05:43:01] <scott_gonzalez> I actually didn't realize that `bottom: x` doesn't mean "stay at the bottom"
[05:43:28] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: pretty much the same error
[05:43:48] <jzaefferer> With "Trace/BPT trap: 5" at the end
[05:44:05] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez  Took me a minute to get that as well.  I couldn't think of a sane way to implement that.  Glad we're on the same page.
[05:44:12] <rxaviers> ok.. weird getting this error. But, it seems you dont have IM installed.
[05:44:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, seems like we'd need to listen to scroll events and move it, which we definitely shouldn't be doing.
[05:44:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we'll wait and see if there's a response.
[05:45:20] <rxaviers> my `IM check` test dont take into account when the command exits that way.. So, I will add a try catch to the first check and consider any error as IM not installed.
[05:50:40] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay, sounds good; where do I find IM installation instructions?
[05:50:58] <rxaviers> good point.. another thing that should be added to README
[05:51:25] <rxaviers> for now, scott_gonzalez researched some ways of doing it on Mac. One way is to use `port`
[05:51:50] <rxaviers> well. I think that on README we should just link IM download page and let user to pick the best way for him
[05:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: MacPorts installs a broken version.
[05:51:56] <rxaviers> http://www.imagemagick.org/download/
[05:52:02] <rxaviers> ah! right
[05:52:18] <scott_gonzalez> Still have that gist with the install steps?
[05:52:19] <rxaviers> another thing wroth mentioning.. We currently require version 6.6.x
[05:52:24] <rxaviers> which is not the latest
[05:52:49] <rxaviers> so jzaefferer, you can try this
[05:53:37] <rxaviers> https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/4998952
[05:58:00] <jzaefferer> so I shouldn't use brew either?
[05:58:35] <jzaefferer> I'll try out the commands from that gist
[06:00:51] <jzaefferer> gah: configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
[06:01:01] <jzaefferer> guess I need to install XCode (again) first :/
[06:01:13] <jzaefferer> recently updated from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion
[06:01:31] <jzaefferer> annoying how much that overwrote
[06:01:51] <rxaviers> yeap perhaps :'(
[06:05:33] <jzaefferer> well, XCode 4 is installed, but looks like I need to install the "command line tools" first :/

[06:06:24] <rxaviers> :P
[06:08:42] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: that error handler doesn't help, crashes with the same exception, not your custom error. Not suprising, since _spawn pretty much has to be async
[06:09:02] <jzaefferer> you can't catch an async exception with a sync try/catch block
[06:09:32] <rxaviers> well, I was already treating the async err.. why isnt it getting there

[09:01:24] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, since we're having a build-app task now. I'm renaming the previous build task to build-package. I think it makes it more explicit having build-app and build-packages, then build and build-app;
[09:01:33] <rxaviers> packages (plural)
[09:01:59] <rxaviers> In order to do that, I also need to update dependents, which is jqueryui.com AFIAK. Any other?

[10:10:11] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Presumably you just want to pass a pointer id along with the coordinates.
[10:11:10] <Dave_Stein> well so far i removed the guards for "one interaction" and then took away something else that i need to put back in along the lines of "dont do this twice if theres a hook already"
[10:11:29] <Dave_Stein> but the bulk of work is making it handle multiple touches in a loop rather than targeting item(0)
[10:11:43] <Dave_Stein> and then the wonkyness i'm experiencing is switching getTouch to getTouches
[10:11:54] <Dave_Stein> which right now is just pushing into an array for looping, but that's the part that is doing things improperly
[10:12:05] <Dave_Stein> cause it may need Event2, Event1, to map to fingers correctly but its always gonna do Event1, Event2
[10:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know what you mean by Event2, Event1
[10:12:42] <Dave_Stein> sorry touch1, touch2
[10:12:57] <Dave_Stein> so like im blindly pushing the events into an array so if i put two fingerso n the screen, drag with finger 1 and 2,
[10:13:08] <Dave_Stein> even tho finger 1 is the only thing touching a draggable, the draggalbe may jump to finger 2
[10:13:16] <Dave_Stein> cause my loop of "getTouches" isn't smart enough yet
[10:13:25] <Dave_Stein> during the actual move
[10:13:27] <Dave_Stein> start is fine
[10:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> All you should need to do is track the id.
[10:13:49] <Dave_Stein> touch.identifier
[10:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:14:23] <Dave_Stein> yeah that's the part i need to tweak cause i'm sure it has to do with the id like you say.. im just not using it properly yet
[10:14:25] <scott_gonzalez> That logic shouldn't even be Touch specific.
[10:14:45] <Dave_Stein> yeah i just wanted to get *something* working
[10:14:52] <scott_gonzalez> The Touch code should just pass along the x/y/id pair.
[10:16:03] <Dave_Stein> im only using touch code where the touch code already existed
[10:16:14] <Dave_Stein> which is the code regarding changedTouches
[10:16:30] <Dave_Stein> it was hardedcoded to item(0)
[10:16:48] <Dave_Stein> but i agree with what you're saying... im not nearyl done yet
[10:16:58] <Dave_Stein> i was just playing around to get an idea since ive done zero things with touch before
[10:17:30] <Dave_Stein> also changedTouches is not the proper one to use since it won't give both fingers

[10:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: You don't care about anything that hasn't changed.
[10:21:08] <scott_gonzalez> At least I don't think you will.
[10:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> Why would you want that information?
[10:21:20] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: if i put two fingers on two draggables i need to know where i just touched on drag start
[10:21:40] <scott_gonzalez> You definitely only care about the changes in that case.
[10:21:57] <Dave_Stein> you are thinking like these names make sense :D
[10:22:13] <Dave_Stein> if i touch both draggables, with two fingers, changedTouches will NOT fire for finger 1
[10:22:17] <Dave_Stein> in iOS at least
[10:22:45] <Dave_Stein> unless you are a robot and can hit both exactly same time , which i think the simluar accounts for
[10:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> Let's use proper terminology so that we can communicate better.
[10:22:55] <scott_gonzalez> changedTouches isn't an event.
[10:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> It never fires.
[10:23:16] <Dave_Stein> sorry, changedTouches will not always contain 2 fingers when the actual event fires
[10:23:21] <Dave_Stein> "If you put two fingers down at exactly the same time, you will get two items in changedTouches, one for each finger that triggered the event."
[10:23:29] <Dave_Stein> "When you put a second finger down, touches will contain two items, one for each finger. targetTouches will have two items only if the second finger was placed in the same node as the first finger (otherwise it will only contain the second finger). changedTouches will only have information related to the second finger, because it’s what triggered the event."
[10:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> Right, we only care about the chagne.
[10:24:11] <Dave_Stein> but most humans will not touch both same exact time
[10:24:17] <scott_gonzalez> Why does that matter/
[10:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> You'll still get 2 events.
[10:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> And each event will have 1 changed touch.
[10:24:38] <Dave_Stein> ah good point
[10:25:17] <Dave_Stein> this simulator im using must be lame then as well.. i hit a key to simulate having two fingers... and click which should mean i hit same time but its not doing that
[10:25:21] <Dave_Stein> maybe thats what confused me in first place
[10:25:31] <Dave_Stein> it was saying the list had one item only
[10:25:40] <Dave_Stein> but it was probably saying one item per event
[10:25:42] <Dave_Stein> like you said
[10:28:01] <Dave_Stein> i gotta get back to behance work tho...at the very least i got unit fixes and whatnot over weekend for draggable and droppable.. mike got back and continued unit work for droppable

[13:11:03] <maxxx> hey guys i think i found a weird bug with autocomplete
[13:11:16] <maxxx> demo here http://jsfiddle.net/VYvmm/
[13:12:14] <maxxx> basically when you click on the menu item in the broken version, you need to click twice to trigger the next select event
[13:17:09] <jquicommit> [13download.jqueryui.com] 15rxaviers opened issue #116: Update README  02http://git.io/vJISRQ
[13:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> maxxx: It seems to be working fine for me.
[13:19:04] <maxxx> what browser? i only tried in chrome
[13:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome.
[13:20:14] <maxxx> and you're clicking on the menuitems?
[13:21:12] <maxxx> it's only on the second time
[13:21:17] <maxxx> if you don't reset focus
[13:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see.
[13:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> If I click on the input again the bug doesn't occur.
[13:22:22] <maxxx> yeah
[13:23:24] <maxxx> so maybe some other click handler is overriding the e.isDefaultPrevented()?
[13:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what's going on there. I'll need to dig in.
[13:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> I need to put together a test case for a Firefox bug first.
[13:25:05] <maxxx> np. thanks scott
[13:25:23] <maxxx> luckily i can use a callback
[13:35:11] <maxxx> added instructions http://jsfiddle.net/VYvmm/1/
