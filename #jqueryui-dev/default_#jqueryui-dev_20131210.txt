[01:00:07] <samarjit> I would suggest creating separate CSS classes for different colors in jquery ui framework. This will enable these css classes outside the widgets as well
[01:42:50] <samarjit> really silent

[03:21:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pong!
[03:21:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[03:22:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey!
[03:22:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I get errors when I try to build API docs local
[03:22:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: From master?
[03:22:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was wondering if you get those too
[03:22:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: both master and 1-4
[03:22:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: although I get different errors
[03:23:16] <uGoMobi> I ran npm install
[03:23:27] <uGoMobi> didn't solve it
[03:27:14] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... while we're at it, I don't quite get agcolom's doc about 1-4 commits that should also go into master ... aren't we /merging/ 1-4 and master?
[03:28:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, but before we do it we create a 1-3 branch
[03:28:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so this is about changes that should land in that 1-3 branch as well
[03:29:19] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see ...
[03:29:41] <uGoMobi> we can just cherry-pick the commits
[03:29:46] <_|Nix|_> So, git checkout -b 1-3 master; git cherry-pick <those commits>; git checkout 1-4; git rebase master;
[03:30:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: first cherry-pick into master, then create 1-3
[03:30:38] <uGoMobi> otherwise they still won't be in 1-3
[03:30:51] <_|Nix|_> Yeah they will ...
[03:30:58] <uGoMobi> not cherry-picking from 1-4 into 1-3
[03:31:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can get started with this ... I can check for build issues along the way.
[03:32:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool
[03:32:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm not having any build problems, but I'll rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clean && npm install and try again ...
[03:32:41] <uGoMobi> I wonder if it has to do with my jquery-wp-content
[03:33:01] <uGoMobi> but I don't have problems when I build jquerymobile.com
[03:34:07] <uGoMobi> and building API docs used to work for me last week
[03:34:14] <_|Nix|_> Weird ...

[06:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: master should definitely be updated before the creation of the 1-3 branch.
[06:06:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK.
