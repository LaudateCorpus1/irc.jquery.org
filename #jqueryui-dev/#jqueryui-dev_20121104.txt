[06:34:07] <proview2> nice there is a jquery ui channel! :)
[06:34:19] <mikesherov> :-)
[06:34:42] <proview2> I'm trying to use  jquery UI sortable together with draggable, http://jsfiddle.net/rUMAX/1/ the elements are being cloned instead of 'moved', and the drop doesn't work for recently moved items, any recommendations?
[06:35:28] <mikesherov> proview2: this is for development of jQueryUI itselfâ€¦ you should be asking your question in #jquery
[06:36:24] <proview2> oh isee
[06:36:25] <proview2> my bad
[06:36:40] <proview2> srry, thanks anyway :)
[06:37:02] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: this fixes the interactions test fails: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/809
[06:37:28] <mikesherov> I'll have the position fail fixed shortly hopefully
[06:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[06:38:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be looking at the tooltip + jQuery 1.6.1 fail tomorrow probably.
[06:39:18] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like I worked around the jQuery bug in another test suite, so I just need to track that down and see if I should abstract out a test helper or something.
[06:39:36] <mikesherov> so I don't know if you saw yesterday, but I cleaned up the suite so there are no non-qunit globals
[06:39:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I saw that :-)
[06:40:10] <mikesherov> I followed the <widget_name>_test_helpers.html filename pattern for test helpers. Hopefully that's what we want to be doing
[06:40:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking about splitting out the QUnit globals into their own block so that it's clear what's coming from QUnit since there's a lot.
[06:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:41:28] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Q-uZAQ

[06:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Did you get an email notification for that PR closing just now?
[06:42:17] <mikesherov> yes
[06:42:23] <scott_gonzalez> I saw that GitHub sends out "Closed xxx" notifications now, but not sure if they send them out when a PR is closed from a merge.
[06:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[06:42:39] <mikesherov> yeah, they also send out "merged xxx" as well
[06:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nice. I was hoping it would be more detailed than just the closed email.
[06:45:44] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: are there plans to move jquery.simulate.js to the jquery github?
[06:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> We probably should. I always thought it was odd that it was built in the UI repo.
[06:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> We should clean it up first though.
[06:47:57] <mikesherov> yeah, there's a few enhancements to dragging we could make
[06:48:24] <mikesherov> I'd want to move it to jquery so we could use issues, etc. rather than todo's in code
[06:48:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that'd be much better.
[06:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> I guess there's no reason to wait.
[06:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Got any API suggestions for a version of _on() (inside $.Widget) that doesn't do the disabled check?
[06:52:26] <mikesherov> looking
[06:52:35] <mikesherov> this is for that new ticket that came in
[06:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's something I've wanted from day one.
[06:53:02] <scott_gonzalez> There are a few places where we avoid using _on() because of the check.
[06:53:14] <scott_gonzalez> And there are a few places where we use it and it causes bugs.
[06:53:42] <mikesherov> trying to avoid the boolean trap
[06:53:52] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #758: STILL FAILING in 12 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/758/
[06:53:53] <doesallmagic> mike.sherov: Dev: fix IE fails in draggable and selectable - Fixed #8770 Dev: Remove globals and Standardize Test Suite
[06:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I mean we could just throw a boolean in front, and do more shuffling, but...
[06:54:42] <mikesherov> throw a boolean in the back too
[06:56:46] <mikesherov> oh, I seeâ€¦ you're already doing hockey, scott_gonzalez
[06:57:01] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:00:15] <scott_gonzalez> I kinda wish I didn't make `element` optional.
[07:01:02] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose we could change the API in 1.10 and add in some back compat.
[07:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> Make element required and then add the flag.
[07:01:47] <mikesherov> yeah, it's tough
[07:01:57] <mikesherov> optional params in the front are especially tough
[07:03:26] <scott_gonzalez> As much as that's true, I kinda like ._on( [flag, ] element, handlers )
[07:05:48] <mikesherov> sure
[07:39:05] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: soâ€¦ I figured out the position fail
[07:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> oh yeah?
[07:39:31] <mikesherov> same situation as core
[07:39:40] <mikesherov> a leaked style
[07:39:49] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[07:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> Any idea why the position plugin doesn't handle the leaked style?
[07:40:26] <mikesherov> I think it's actually something with scollTop being different in some cases in IE8
[07:41:18] <mikesherov> pretty sure it's a core bug
[07:43:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's file an issue for core and just get read of the style leak in the UI test.
[07:43:29] <scott_gonzalez> That's what we did with the core fail, right?
[07:47:11] <mikesherov> right
[07:47:31] <mikesherov> it's this rule: .container,
[07:47:32] <mikesherov> .navbar-fixed-top .container,
[07:47:33] <mikesherov> .navbar-fixed-bottom .container {
[07:47:34] <mikesherov>   width: 940px;
[07:47:35] <mikesherov> }
[07:47:53] <mikesherov> but you gotta remove it in bootstrap.min.css

[08:05:09] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I have a different workaround
[08:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> What's that?
[08:05:37] <mikesherov> so, that test specifically is behind a scrollTopSupport() check
[08:05:47] <mikesherov> which I think is designed specifically to work around this problem
[08:05:55] <mikesherov> but it only checks scrollTop sanity
[08:06:07] <mikesherov> I think if I make it check scrollLeft sanity too, it's fine
[08:06:14] <mikesherov> in that it doesn't run the test
[08:06:35] <mikesherov> we should still file a core bug, but at least it's a feature detect rather than a css hack
[08:06:38] <scott_gonzalez> And if the core bug gets fixed that test will start running again?
[08:06:41] <mikesherov> right
[08:06:43] <mikesherov> exactly
[08:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, sounds good.
[08:06:55] <mikesherov> lemme see, I'll report back
[08:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> I think I wrote that test for iOS.
[08:06:59] <mikesherov> interesting
[08:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> That's where scrollTop is useless, right?
[08:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe not.
[08:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> That condition isn't failing in any browsers in TestSwarm, so it clearly wasn't written for any of those.
[08:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8425
[08:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> hmm.... http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10419
[08:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> I would expect this to work, but I see why it doesn't.

[08:12:20] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: maybe we should be doing it to the document instead?
[08:12:30] <mikesherov> sometimes core bugs get closed wrongly
[08:14:46] <scott_gonzalez> Doing what? The scrollTop() check?
[08:15:07] <mikesherov> yeah
[08:15:09] <mikesherov> I dunno
[08:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> You can try that.
[08:25:57] <mikesherov> so, interesting, If I change scrollLeft() in that test to less than 150, it works just fine
[08:26:02] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so weird ^
[08:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> wtf
[08:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> I guess just changing that is fine.
[08:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> It seems super weird though.

[08:38:31] <mikesherov> like an insane number of things have to go wrong simultaneously

[09:09:28] <mikesherov> FIGURED IT OUT scott_gonzalez
[09:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:09:44] <scott_gonzalez> Perfect timing, was about to close my laptop :-P
[09:09:57] <mikesherov> it's when there is a vertical scrollbar on the run page iframe
[09:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> stupid scrollbars
[09:10:40] <mikesherov> not sure why, if I go into run.js in the testswarm code
[09:10:56] <mikesherov> and change line 163: iframe.height = 120;
[09:11:02] <mikesherov> then it goes away
[09:11:29] <mikesherov> the reason is that's the height that removes a vertical scrollbar
[09:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> Dropping from 600 to 120 makes the scrollbar go away?
[09:13:24] <mikesherov> makes the outer vertical scrollbar go away
[09:13:38] <mikesherov> because the iframe on the page is smaller
[09:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, on the page containing the iframe
[09:13:42] <mikesherov> Right
[09:14:04] <mikesherov> looks like getBoundingClientRect gets confused by 1px in that case...
[09:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[09:14:30] <mikesherov> yeah, crazy
[09:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so send a PR for whatever you think is the sanest workaround.
[09:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> Do you think this will actually get fixed in core? It seems kinda crazy.
[09:15:57] <mikesherov> I doubt it
[09:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.
[09:16:14] <mikesherov> no internet research seems to indicate anyone else hitting this bug
[09:16:24] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a lot of work to fix this.
[09:16:27] <mikesherov> right
[09:16:42] <mikesherov> so, I'm just going to put in that workaround
[09:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:17:16] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully this Opear 12 fail was random.
[09:17:24] <scott_gonzalez> s/Opear/Opera/
[09:17:40] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:18:01] <scott_gonzalez> If not, jzaefferer is in trouble :-P
[09:21:03] <scott_gonzalez> Heading downstairs, later.
[09:22:21] <_zoggy_> Internet Explorer was up half a point to 54.13 percent share, its highest level since September 2011. Chrome was down 0.31 points to 18.55 percent, hitting a one year low after its third consecutive month of losses. Firefox fell 0.09 points to 19.99 percent.
[09:23:24] <_zoggy_> Opera was essentially unchanged, up 0.01 points to 1.63 percent.
[09:23:55] <_zoggy_> will be intresting to see what the ie10 adoption rate is next month
[09:24:08] <_zoggy_> sadly no ie10 for win7 for a bit :/
[09:24:18] <_zoggy_> still stuck supporting ie8/9
[09:24:57] <_zoggy_> Internet Explorer 9 broke through 20 percent for the first time: Internet Explorer 9 now has more users than all versions of Chrome, and more users than all versions of Firefox.
[09:25:32] <mikesherov> _zoggy_: where does your info come from?
[09:25:54] <_zoggy_> http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/11/firefox-dips-below-20-percent-chrome-falls-internet-explorer-gains/
[09:26:13] <_zoggy_> which comes from netmarketshare
[09:26:28] <mikesherov> gnarf: you still there?
[09:26:44] <mikesherov> _zoggy_: netmarketshare is misinformed
[09:27:01] <mikesherov> they apply statistical skews to the actual reported numbers
[09:27:18] <mikesherov> which indicate things like IE6 usage growing
[09:27:23] <mikesherov> which is obviously false
[09:27:34] <_zoggy_> how is that false?
[09:27:59] <mikesherov> IE6 usage?
[09:28:12] <_zoggy_> in america i sure hope that ie6 is not growing..  sure. but sadly in china a lot of comps (win xp) have ie6 and never get upgraded
[09:28:35] <mikesherov> right, that's fine
[09:28:43] <mikesherov> not shrinking is one thing
[09:28:46] <mikesherov> but GROWING?
[09:29:02] <mikesherov> all of the other tracking sites have it dropping
[09:29:07] <mikesherov> http://gs.statcounter.com/ for example
[09:29:53] <gnarf> mikesherov: sup
[09:30:06] <mikesherov> gnarf: can you apply this PR's fixes to the swarm.jquery.org installation: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/pull/241/files
[09:30:19] <mikesherov> I really want to see green on UI
[09:30:51] <gnarf> mikesherov: can we wait for Krinkle to way in on that one?
[09:31:02] <mikesherov> I mean, sure
[09:31:07] <mikesherov> but he'll say it should be fixed in core
[09:31:20] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/issues/47#issuecomment-9408635
[09:31:40] <gnarf> the crazy bug where it's off by one px when inside an iframe on a page with a scrollbar?
[09:31:46] <gnarf> sounds unfixable in core
[09:31:53] <_zoggy_> http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-CN-monthly-201110-201210
[09:31:55] <_zoggy_> intresting
[09:32:16] <mikesherov> gnarf: fixable, but insanely ugly
[09:32:32] <mikesherov> or maybe not even
[09:32:59] <mikesherov> so, I'll wait for him to weigh in, but that's the fix for now
[09:33:15] <mikesherov> the truth is that the run page should be as pristine as possible with almost no styling
[09:33:29] <mikesherov> if it was possible to not use an iframe, that'd be even better
[09:34:17] <mikesherov> all the arguments I made here apply: https://github.com/jquery/2012-dev-summit/issues/47
[09:35:38] <gnarf> yeah
[09:35:38] <mikesherov> _zoggy_: yes
[09:35:43] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure its in the work mikesherov
[09:36:42] <mikesherov> ok, awesome
[09:36:49] <mikesherov> then I'll just wait
[09:37:28] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! Made that change to web-based-template and all ok now with the index page!!!
[09:38:43] <mikesherov> Krinkle|detached: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/pull/241/files this fixes the test failures in IE8
[09:41:22] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: you here?
[11:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: What exactly is the bug in http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7220 ?
[11:13:29] <mikesherov> drag the blue bar into the box
[11:13:42] <mikesherov> the drag position isn't where it ends up when dropped
[11:13:59] <mikesherov> I'm closing this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3715
[11:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but look at all that custom code in the drop callback.
[11:14:19] <scott_gonzalez> It clones the element and sets the position.
[11:14:35] <mikesherov> OH
[11:14:42] <mikesherov> lemme do
[11:14:53] <mikesherov> double check
[11:16:11] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: http://jsfiddle.net/tbdqn/1/
[11:16:36] <scott_gonzalez> He's creating the element himself, so the positioning can be whatever he wants.
[11:16:40] <mikesherov> right, but what about this: http://jsfiddle.net/tbdqn/2/
[11:17:04] <scott_gonzalez> There's no element after the drop in that one.
[11:17:13] <scott_gonzalez> Because the helper is a clone, so it goes away at the end.
[11:17:30] <mikesherov> I see
[11:17:37] <mikesherov> so what is this then? won't fix?
[11:17:42] <mikesherov> notabug?
[11:17:44] <scott_gonzalez> If you use a helper, then the helper only exists for the duration of the drag.
[11:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like notabug to me.
[11:17:58] <mikesherov> OK, then can you handle that ticket
[11:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> The OP even seemed to think so.

[11:18:29] <mikesherov> I see
[11:19:23] <mikesherov> thanks for catching that!
[11:19:35] <mikesherov> I'm planning a second triage pass after the first one
[11:19:51] <mikesherov> to remove more dupes, and investigate deeper the ones I've marked as open
[11:20:15] <scott_gonzalez> closed
[11:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[11:20:44] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, you beat me to closing it.
[11:21:17] <mikesherov> So, what's the process for closing feature requests?
[11:21:33] <mikesherov> so like, this one: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4781
[11:21:38] <mikesherov> shouldn't this be closed?
[11:22:54] <scott_gonzalez> Well, right now there's no way to accomplish that.
[11:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> But there should be.
[11:23:26] <scott_gonzalez> So while the proposed solution won't get used, the problem he's encountering will.
[11:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> When we add a refresh() method to draggable, it should support his use case.
[11:24:02] <mikesherov> I see
[11:24:11] <jzaefferer> hey mikesherov
[11:24:13] <mikesherov> Should there be a master ticket for refresh?
[11:24:15] <mikesherov> hey jzaefferer
[11:24:26] <jzaefferer> I'm still looking through the selectable and sortable new feature tickets
[11:25:04] <mikesherov> k
[11:25:16] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: can you land the testswarm fix I proposed?
[11:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: There are two things regarding a master ticket for refresh.
[11:25:33] <mikesherov> so we can make that change and get position tests to pass?
[11:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> 1) We don't create the API redesign tickets until after creating a forum + blog post to gather community feedback.
[11:26:09] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: yes, I can. Was gonna wait for Krinkle, but the sooner our testsuite becomes reliable again, the better.
[11:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> 2) Closing these as duplicates of a master ticket would prevent them from showing up in the changelog.
[11:26:36] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: sounds good
[11:27:09] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: the change needs to be applied to the swarm installation as well, not just merged into github, scott_gonzalez can you do that?
[11:27:20] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: I can handle both
[11:27:24] <mikesherov> great!
[11:27:25] <mikesherov> Thanks
[11:28:06] <mikesherov> I just want to see green :-)
[11:28:38] <jzaefferer> okay, landed, pulled, triggering a UI build now
[11:28:51] <mikesherov> *fingers crossed*
[11:28:55] <jzaefferer> exitment! http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/760/
[11:29:04] <mikesherov> OK guys, I gotta run in 3 minutes. jzaefferer did you have something specific you wanted to ask me?
[11:29:17] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: nope, just checkin' in :-)
[11:29:24] <mikesherov> OK, great
[11:29:24] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: do you know FLASH CAGE?
[11:29:39] <mikesherov> no?
[11:29:47] <mikesherov> resizable and sortable is all that is left to triageâ€¦ we're under 100 "new" bugs
[11:29:50] <mikesherov> what's flash cage?
[11:29:50] <jzaefferer> there are a few UI memes...
[11:30:06] <jzaefferer> Scott needs to tell you next time we meet :-)
[11:30:16] <mikesherov> :-)
[11:31:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Why do you think this is a bug instead of a feature? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7091
[11:31:38] <mikesherov> waitingâ€¦. http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1271
[11:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> I had a flash cage moment at the dev summit, but it didn't result in any new words, just me giving gnarf a death stare :-P
[11:32:59] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what he says here: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7091#comment:4
[11:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7091#comment:5
[11:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> That bug and the ticket are different things.
[11:34:40] <jzaefferer> Assuming his results are correct, what's the reason for checking visibility before setting the activeClass?
[11:34:48] <mikesherov> seems stuck: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1271
[11:35:13] <jzaefferer> Right, that's what I was asking mikesherov et al to do - verify that the bug actually exists and creating a new ticket (or change this one)
[11:35:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: flash cage?
[11:35:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm sure I deserved it, whatever this means
[11:35:48] <gnarf> :)
[11:36:16] <jzaefferer> wait, gnarf also doesn't know about flash cage?
[11:36:28] * gnarf shrugs
[11:36:41] <gnarf> I think I do, I just don't know it AS "FLASH CAGE"
[11:36:41] <gnarf> :)
[11:37:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: It's by design that you cannot activate something which is not visible.
[11:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> The request is to change that.
[11:37:25] <scott_gonzalez> That's a feature request, not a bug report.
[11:37:36] <scott_gonzalez> The OP even agrees in comment #4.
[11:37:43] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: I think browserstack is all queued up again: https://gist.github.com/04e6291ae83e33f63e91
[11:37:53] <scott_gonzalez> "When I first looked at the current behavior (of ui.droppable) (that is, without looking at the code), I was reasoning from the way I wanted to use ui.droppable. The initial post for this ticket was made given this background. And judging from the initial post text, I'm inclined to agree with you that it's a feature, not a bug."
[11:39:32] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: emailed browserstack people, on the same thread Krinkle started 4 days ago; seems like the same problem
[11:40:17] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: so is it a valid feature request? or can we close it? and/or create a bug ticket? I don't care that much what it was initially about if we got wiser on the way
[11:40:18] <scott_gonzalez> Is BrowserStack under water?
[11:40:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I marked it as a valid feature request and left a comment.
[11:41:17] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: forward that thread to browserstack to you
[11:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> We're approaching 500 :-)
[11:45:46] <scott_gonzalez> And on that note, I need to get back to other stuff.
[11:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> Looking forward to finally getting stuff done again tomorrow.
[12:05:21] <mikesherov> ugh, so my fix broke tabs and draggable?
[12:05:22] <mikesherov> fun
[12:05:29] <mikesherov> but at least consistent cross browser
[12:05:46] <mikesherov> that exposes a few bugs in tabs and draggable :-)
[12:05:51] <mikesherov> will fix those shortly
[12:14:46] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #760: STILL FAILING in 46 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/760/
[14:04:49] <_zoggy_> whoever took the pictures at the jquery bowling must have a thing for asians :x
[14:07:14] <_zoggy_> and for the dude with crazy hair wearing white shirt with tie
[19:14:14] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: And it didn't even fix position :-(
