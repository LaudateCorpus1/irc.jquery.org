[13:23:46] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Think the icons page should be in the theming directory?
[13:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> I had that in my notes but forgot to write it on the PR.
[13:24:12] <tj_vantoll> Ok.
[13:25:33] <tj_vantoll> Is there something that auto increments these version numbers or is that a manual process: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/140/files#L5R6. I ask because I copied this structure from other pages directly.
[13:33:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's a manual process during releases.
[13:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> See http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/59346425/Release%20Checklist
[13:33:29] <scott_gonzalez> search for api.jqueryui.com (near the bottom)
[13:37:03] <tj_vantoll> Ok. I didn't like the iframe either but I also didn't have a better idea. If UI were loaded on the page we could make the list right there, but that can be problematic as well.
[13:37:03] <tj_vantoll> Anyways it's landed now https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commit/e26078be93fdee1e90bd045defca438d642e9634.
[13:38:44] <tj_vantoll> I'll get started on adding info on the individual widgets this weekend.
