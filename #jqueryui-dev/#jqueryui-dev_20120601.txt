[11:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> This guy did a great job at ensuring that I won't pay any attention to his ticket: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8376
[11:48:48] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: bummer
[11:49:13] <johnbender> one of the very interesting things that I realized after starting on jqm was that most of my work is in fact communication
[11:49:20] <johnbender> stuff like that makes it a lot less fun :(
[11:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's totally not worth it.
[11:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> My site is broken. You can't see it, and I won't spend the time to provide a test case that you can see.
[13:00:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: what an asshole
[13:00:25] <scott_gonzalez> right?
[13:00:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: in other news... i have stage.view.jqueryui.com working i think
[13:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> His original post was not at all clear.
[13:00:39] <gnarf> wanna test? :)
[13:01:12] <scott_gonzalez> <!-- Domain mapping issue. -->
[13:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> Is it not on 205.186.144.58?
[13:01:36] <gnarf> 205.186.153.188
[13:01:44] <gnarf> jq03.stage
[13:02:06] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> switching browsers, since Chrome will cache that DNS lookup for a while.
[13:02:27] <gnarf> right! how lame!
[13:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> seems to be working well :-)
[13:05:19] <gnarf> yeah - its pretty easy to set up too
[13:05:42] <gnarf> jenkins and swarm are still on my list
[13:06:03] <gnarf> got a few good hours in today with jzaefferer - but i spent most of my time making sure we had phantomjs and node
[13:14:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i stood up for you! :)
