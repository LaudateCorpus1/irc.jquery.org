[11:25:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[11:26:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey! Is it OK to add CLA:Valid by hand? There was an error checking the CLA, so it added CLA:Error to my PR.
[11:26:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/status/?repo=jquery-mobile&sha=a8e7d920d449d4628b4942dbf8cc12c86de879d6
[11:26:47] <arschmitz> No 
[11:26:55] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[11:27:04] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: im sure will want to look at those to try to find the problem
[11:27:12] <gabriel_schulhof> It's too bad you can't re-run the check like you can with Travis.
[11:27:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah. "Invalid revision range" sounds like a bug.
[11:27:45] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...
[11:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> That bug should have been resolved already.
[11:27:56] <arschmitz> you will be able to eventually https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license/issues/6
[11:28:15] <arschmitz> and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license/issues/2
[11:28:26] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: it did it to me yesterday too with classes
[11:29:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ... re-check would be nice! Of course, you need to make sure that only certain people can click the re-check button.
[11:29:58] <gabriel_schulhof> I think maybe it should be limited to us - just as the ability on Travis to re-run jobs/builds is limited to us.
