[15:02:55] <scott_gonzalez_> Soo....I need to detect IE 8 in a test. Suggestions for the sanest check to use?
[15:03:17] <scott_gonzalez_> I don't want to write a feature detect, even though it's possible.

[16:54:21] <scott_gonzalez_> arschmitz: ping
[16:54:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez_: Pong
[16:55:16] <scott_gonzalez_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widgets/button.js#L241
[16:55:28] <scott_gonzalez_> Button calls `._classes()` with an invalid signature.
[16:55:43] <arschmitz> wow how did that get through thats old
[16:55:47] <arschmitz> it should not call classes at all
[16:55:55] <arschmitz> it sould be
[16:55:59] <scott_gonzalez_> Yeah, just pass the class name directly, right?
[16:56:08] <arschmitz> this._toggleClass( "ui-button-icon-only", null, !value );
[16:56:13] <arschmitz> yeah
[16:56:43] <arschmitz> _classes is private
[16:56:50] <arschmitz> to the factory
[16:56:56] <arschmitz> no widget should use it
[16:56:58] <scott_gonzalez_> yeah
[16:57:02] <scott_gonzalez_> I'll push a fix in a second.
[16:57:20] <scott_gonzalez_> Noticed this because the spinner test suite just fell apart recently.
[16:57:28] <scott_gonzalez_> When core removed .toggleClass( boolean )
[16:57:45] <scott_gonzalez_> The current code is causing us to pass an empty string.
[16:57:58] <arschmitz> ahh
[16:58:00] <scott_gonzalez_> Which core apparently doesn't handle now (just fell into the boolean trap.
[16:58:44] <arschmitz> yeah i wonder if thats part of an issue i noticed yesterday
[16:59:02] <arschmitz> there are no tests for spinner in control group and i was getting a weird failure when i added them
[16:59:11] <scott_gonzalez_> Yeah, that's probably what it was.

[16:59:14] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06master 145d7e8b1 15Scott GonzÃ¡lez: Button: Fix call to `._toggleClass()`
[16:59:17] <scott_gonzalez_> Just pushed the fix.
[16:59:24] <scott_gonzalez_> So you can try adding it again and see if it works now.
[16:59:29] <arschmitz> cool ill check if that fixes my tests
[16:59:47] <arschmitz> FYI selenium promises are insane!
[16:59:57] <scott_gonzalez_> If you were failing against 1.11.3 (or any released version), then it was some other issue.
[17:00:05] <scott_gonzalez_> You'd only get this failure with core git.
[17:00:10] <scott_gonzalez_> haha
[17:00:16] <arschmitz> they use a promise manager
[17:00:32] <arschmitz> so all promises are essentially .then'ed even if they are not
[17:00:51] <arschmitz> like all promises are executed syncronously as if they were all in a single promise chain!
[17:01:51] <arschmitz> i did get the whole suite running and passing via selenium though and reporting back just need to clean up output and try to wire up vagrant
[17:06:19] <scott_gonzalez_> ugh: http://swarm.jquery.org/index.php?action=result&item=747545&raw=#qunit-test-output-dc779943
