[07:33:00] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (3d, 20h ago): Datepicker: Added additional check to checkExternalClick
[07:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> I see you have two branches bug_7686 and bug_7686_2
[07:33:26] <scott_gonzalez> is that pull request from the correct branch?
[07:35:33] <kborchers> i believe so but let me double check. i have a bad habit of doing that and then not deleting the one i don't need anymore
[07:38:58] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yes that is the correct branch. this should also help you check it http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/w9Uny/

[07:48:06] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Datepicker: Added additional check to checkExternalClick to work when clicking in another datepicker and removed old fix. Fixes #7686 - infinite loop when onclose event shows a second calendar - kborchers
[08:14:27] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: you did the smarter collision detection for position, right?
[08:14:40] <kborchers> yes
[08:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> do you have time to look at something?
[08:14:54] <kborchers> did you find an issue?
[08:15:06] <kborchers> sure
[08:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> open the default demo
[08:15:31] <kborchers> ok
[08:15:31] <scott_gonzalez> change the #parent to have width: 600px instead of 60%
[08:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> then shrink your browser window down
[08:16:07] <scott_gonzalez> keep all the default settings
[08:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> move the parent left until the boxes flip
[08:16:24] <scott_gonzalez> notice they flip at the same time
[08:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> which is wrong
[08:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> at least I *think* it's wrong
[08:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> I could be wrong
[08:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[08:17:48] <kborchers> why is that wrong? they are both left top / left top so as soon as the left top corner collides with window they both have a collision and should flip no?
[08:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> actually, I suppose there's a good chance I am wrong
[08:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...so is there anything that would cause them to flip at different times?
[08:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> since they're different widths
[08:19:17] <kborchers> change my to right top
[08:21:26] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I guess this is all correct :-P
[08:21:37] <scott_gonzalez> I hate this plugin
[08:21:40] <scott_gonzalez> it's so confusing
[08:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, I love it because it makes it so simple
[08:21:56] <kborchers> heh ... i think i actually kind of have my head around it now
[08:22:11] <scott_gonzalez> but the implementation has always been really tough
[08:22:59] <scott_gonzalez> ok, default setting, drag up
[08:23:01] <scott_gonzalez> they shouldn't flip
[08:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> that one I know is wrong :-P
[08:24:23] <kborchers> hmmm
[08:25:34] <kborchers> i believe you're right ... though i would think the wider one would flip since it causes the whole element to be visible but the taller one should not
[08:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:29:46] <kborchers> yeah, something is off with the top collision math ... i'll look into it
[08:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> we should really set an explicit height on the #parent in that demo
[08:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> make it more obvious that the small blue box is smaller
[08:31:37] <kborchers> yeah, i think 40px would be good

[08:33:45] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Position demo: Updated sizes of elements. - Scott González
[09:54:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i did some testing and looks like this fixes that flip issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/464
[09:54:04] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (52.394s ago): Position: Check to also make sure to only flip if more of the element is inside "within"
[15:28:45] <gnarf> wow - lots of position work lately for kborchers
[15:28:58] <gnarf> i wonder if his brain is filling up with arcane positioning math
[15:28:59] <gnarf> :)
[16:51:52] <gnarf> hey when was that meeting with nodejitsu?
