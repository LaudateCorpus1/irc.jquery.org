[06:29:47] <m_gol> is jQuery UI 0.10.4 supposed to work with jQuery 1.12/2.2 or is that not supported?
[06:31:24] <m_gol> jzaefferer, do you know?
[06:31:46] <m_gol> it's been released 2 years ago so I suppose it may not be supported but I wanted to make sure
[07:30:34] <jzaefferer> m_gol: you can find supported release with jQuery min version here: http://jqueryui.com/download/
[07:31:10] <jzaefferer> I'm not sure about 1.12/2.2 though. We surely test new releases against those
[07:32:07] <jzaefferer> m_gol: soo, no idea. scott_gonzalez probably knows
[07:39:02] <m_gol> jzaefferer: yeah, min, but not max :-)

[08:57:25] <scott_gonzalez> Max supported version has always been based on release date.
[08:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> So UI 1.10.4 is only guaranteed to work up to jQuery 1.10.2.
[08:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> We do go back and release patches to support new versions of jQuery if necessary.
[08:59:16] <scott_gonzalez> But that's a pretty rare need.
[08:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> At this point 1.10.4 is on its way out.
[10:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer arschmitz: Do you know how to check on download builder?
[10:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/292
[10:35:20] <arschmitz> im not really sure 
[10:35:32] <arschmitz> iv always had terrible luck running it locally
[10:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> This is actually specific to the vader theme.
[10:35:56] <scott_gonzalez> Which seems odd.
[10:36:35] <arschmitz> oh
[10:36:37] <arschmitz> hrm
[10:38:22] <scott_gonzalez> Three more themes to check, but so far everything else works.
[10:38:50] <arschmitz> and it works on 1.11.4
[10:41:40] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm....I'm getting 502 bad gateways for some requests.
[10:41:46] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok so now i can do anything
[10:42:04] <arschmitz> yeah me too
[10:42:44] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: though before this happened i think i found the issue
[10:47:55] <jzaefferer> what node version are we running in production?
[10:48:32] <jzaefferer> I'm getting this useless error, I think from node-syslog: Module version mismatch. Expected 47, got 14.
[10:49:11] <jzaefferer> which is even more annoying considering that we don't even use syslog anymore (I think), just stdout as it should be
[10:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> I think we're using 0.12.x

[11:58:47] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[12:01:37] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I have a failing selectmenu test where it assumes keepNative is honoured. Please remind me: How are we dealing with keepNative again?
[12:02:46] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: ... when all backcompat is turned off.

[14:12:08] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: OK, gotcha.
[14:12:11] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Thanks!
[14:12:34] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: no problem
[14:12:45] <arschmitz> one of those things that just became obsolete basicly
[14:13:13] <arschmitz> making auto init a bit less auto simplified a lot of this stuff
[14:13:14] <sonali5> arschmitz i am still getting CLA error
[14:13:40] <arschmitz> sonali5: looks like you never fixed your git config
[14:13:44] <arschmitz> still has a dash in your name
[14:14:12] <sonali5> i signed CLA with Sonali-Goyal wont that suffice?
[14:14:27] <arschmitz> no it has to be your real name
[14:14:33] <arschmitz> 2 parts
[14:14:43] <sonali5> Oh ok thanks i shall do that
[14:14:44] <arschmitz> unless you have no last name in which case i can over ride
[14:16:23] <sonali5> arschmitz should i fix these https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8241 ?
[14:16:52] <arschmitz> what do you mean fix them

[14:18:15] <sonali5> Oh i am sorry i didnot see that
[14:18:53] <arschmitz> sonali5: no problem
[14:22:08] <sonali5> arschmitz do you think i should work on this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8142 ?
[14:23:56] <arschmitz> sonali5: YES!
[14:24:05] <arschmitz> i would love it if you could work on that one
[14:24:32] <sonali5> ok thanks a lot arschmitz i shall work on that 
[14:25:29] <sonali5> Also arschmitz in this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8161  cannot we solve the issue with what your comments are ?
[14:26:21] <arschmitz> my comment just says we are going to replace
[14:26:36] <arschmitz> the OP comment has a solution
[14:27:41] <sonali5> oh yeah 
[14:27:52] <arschmitz> but the problem is not the "how" its that we dont add options when a re-write is pending
[14:28:12] <sonali5> Oh ok
[15:36:39] <sonali5> arschmitz there ?
