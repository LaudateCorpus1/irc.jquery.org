[05:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> Qalqi: There's probably a thin line between what you can ask related to tweaking.
[05:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> If it's "what options do I set to do X" then ask in #jquery
[05:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> If it's more like "I'm trying to build X and this internal method needs to be split up" or "I need access to this internal state" then this channel is good.
[05:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone around?
