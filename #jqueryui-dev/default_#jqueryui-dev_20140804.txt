[05:23:15] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: when you get a chance: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1304
[05:23:40] <mikesherov_> best kind of fix. Just remove stuff.
[05:27:45] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_: Since the other PR effectively did the same (but with a bad implementation), I'm guessing this is good to go ;-)
[05:28:15] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: I believe so. You should look at the two commits I reference
[05:28:47] <mikesherov_> just to make sure I am understanding the chain of events properly: a hack was introduced in 2009 to fix an issue introduced by a typo
[05:29:03] <mikesherov_> that typo was fixed, but the hack was left intact, causing a diff issue
[05:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> Brad Dunbar. I remember that name.
[05:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, look, he's a maintainer for underscore now.
[05:31:08] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_: Go ahead and land it.
[05:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> Did you make any progress on the other ones?
[05:31:48] <scott_gonzalez> I want to release 1.11.1 this week, so I want to know if we should be waiting for these. I'd love to have all regressions fixed, but I'm fine waiting on some until 1.11.2.
[05:33:11] <mikesherov__> oh, I didn't even see the impl. in the other PR. in that case, yeah, my fix must be the right one.
[05:33:20] <mikesherov__> landing that now then.
[05:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov__: New PR came in last night as well: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1303/files
[05:34:18] <mikesherov__> looking now
[05:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> Just saw it while going through my email.
[05:34:22] <mikesherov__> just seeing that stuff
[05:35:49] <mikesherov__> hmm, his appears more robust
[05:36:08] <mikesherov__> gonna pull down his changes and see if I can get his tests passing with just my changes
[05:39:05] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:41:42] <mikesherov__> what do you know, his tests pass with just my changes
[05:42:09] <mikesherov__> scott_gonzalez: I suppose I should give him the credit, and just squash our two commits together
[05:42:48] <scott_gonzalez> However you want to do it.
[05:43:14] <scott_gonzalez> You can split it in two commits. One with your fix and your tests, and one with his additional tests.
[05:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> Or just squash it all together.
[05:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not a fan of putting someone else's name on source implementations.
[05:44:53] <mikesherov__> makes sense

[06:06:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[06:07:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[06:07:35] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey! Could you please review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7604?
[06:07:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I kinda need it for the textinput action extension.
[06:08:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and the second fix is a regression.
[06:08:40] <arschmitz> oh about this
[06:09:21] <arschmitz> i was doing some thinking on it and talked to scott and we need to handle the text options like this in a certain way
[06:09:53] <gabriel_schulhof> In what way?
[06:09:56] <arschmitz> we do want to enforce it actually being text by default
[06:10:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I know.
[06:10:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm implementing it as anything you can pass into $()
[06:10:20] <gabriel_schulhof> So, a selector, a dom element, or a jQuery object.
[06:10:27] <arschmitz> to protect people from doing foolish things like hooking up an input with out any guards to an option value
[06:10:31] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or an HTML snippet.
[06:10:52] <arschmitz> no it should enforce ONLY text not an html snippit
[06:11:05] <arschmitz> because passing html is also asking for display issues
[06:11:16] <arschmitz> but it should be handled via its own method
[06:11:24] <gabriel_schulhof> ... instead of an option?
[06:11:26] <arschmitz> so people can override it to pass html if they want to
[06:11:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, I see. You mean an extension point.
[06:11:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes
[06:12:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Wait a sec. So, do we have an option, or just an extension point?
[06:12:15] <arschmitz> if we say the type for an option is text though we should 100% enforce that
[06:12:19] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: both
[06:12:23] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[06:12:30] <arschmitz> the extension point is where we enforce type = text
[06:12:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We don't say that though.
[06:12:44] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or we need not say that.
[06:13:13] <gabriel_schulhof> My concern is this: If we force it to be text, and we create a button, what icon shall the button have? Shall it have a shadow? What if you don't want a button?
[06:13:27] <arschmitz> extension 
[06:13:47] <arschmitz> the option is clearbtntext 
[06:13:53] <arschmitz> it should only accept text
[06:14:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Nononono ... you misunderstand.
[06:14:09] <gabriel_schulhof> This is not about clear button.
[06:14:13] <gabriel_schulhof> /That/ is only text.
[06:14:13] <b-ot> gabriel_schulhof: memorised ‚ÄúThat/‚Äù.
[06:14:35] <gabriel_schulhof> clearBtnText is just that. Plain text.
[06:15:01] <gabriel_schulhof> What I was thinking about is introducing a new extension such that clearButton depends on it.
[06:15:12] <gabriel_schulhof> clearButton is a specific case of a more generic extension.
[06:15:23] <arschmitz> im not so sure
[06:15:42] <arschmitz> clear button is already an extension of textinput
[06:16:05] <arschmitz> also not sure we should be putting effort in as textinput is one of the next input going into ui
[06:16:23] <arschmitz> it will likely be in 1.6 as it will likely land with all the button and checkbox stuff
[06:16:37] <gabriel_schulhof> So, we're replacing textinput as well?
[06:16:47] <arschmitz> we are replacing all our widgets basicly
[06:17:12] <arschmitz> execpt like toolbar pagecontainer page panel
[06:17:18] <arschmitz> page related things 
[06:17:32] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. In that case, it's pointles.
[06:17:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Will the UI widgets do everything our widgets can do though?
[06:17:58] <arschmitz> maybe
[06:18:18] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, sure, we can deprecate and then remove everyhting our widets do that UI widgets don't do, but I'm not sure if people will like that.
[06:18:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: werent you at the meeting in amsterdam where we planned all this?
[06:19:19] <gabriel_schulhof> I was there, but I figured we'd replace our stuff in such a way that we retain our current API.
[06:19:40] <arschmitz> we may or may not we change our api all the time adding and removing features
[06:20:18] <arschmitz> there is no guarantee it would remain the same regardless of it being "ours" or "theres"
[06:20:47] <arschmitz> and the simple fact is we are all one big team and any thing we use will have to meat all our needs
[06:21:26] <arschmitz> so if its a valid use case it will remain some things may get moved to extension points its hard to say until api begins to be planned
[06:21:31] <arschmitz> and discussed
[06:21:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, adding a button such that it appears to be part of a textinput is a fairly common UI pattern.
[06:22:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes and so there is a good chance it will be possible
[06:22:30] <arschmitz> but i cant say there is no document or discussion or anything of api yet
[06:22:36] <arschmitz> or abilities
[06:23:23] <gabriel_schulhof> When are we gonna hammer this out?
[06:23:41] <arschmitz> when ever work starts on it
[06:23:58] <arschmitz> most likely once controlgroup is done being developed
[06:24:27] <arschmitz> or as part of control group because one of the current discussions for control group is should it support textinputs
[06:26:21] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Sounds good.
[06:27:11] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll stop working on the textinput extension and start working on uniquely identifying history entries.
[06:27:26] <gabriel_schulhof> ... whenever popstate is available.

[08:43:32] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone running Ubuntu?
[09:27:56] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Sorry! Fedora here.
[09:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> gabriel_schulhof: I wonder if it's close enough :-P If you go to http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/ is the 4th correctly listed as Monday?
[09:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> In Chrome
[09:29:45] <scott_gonzalez> Someone reported a pretty crazy sounding bug: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10470
[09:30:48] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: You mean click on the forth example on the right hand side, then open the datepicker and check if it's pointing at monday?
[09:31:05] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: If so, then yes.
[09:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I meant August 4th :-P
[09:31:54] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: The name of the forth example is "Display button bar"
[09:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> But if Monday is highlighted, then it's working properly for you.
[09:32:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, seems good.
[09:32:16] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for checking. I'll keep trying to find someone with Ubuntu.
[09:32:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Though the input itself is empty.
[09:32:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the bug is that the dates are all shifted by one day for this user.
[09:32:39] <gabriel_schulhof> I would suspect her system time.
[09:33:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Though of course I can imagine that native widgets show it correctly.
[09:33:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Does the browser allow one to set the time zone? Maybe that's what's weird.
[09:33:28] <scott_gonzalez> That was my thought, but `new Date()` gives the right date and it works in Firefox.
[09:33:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Super-weird.
[09:33:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, doesn't make any sense to me.
[09:34:07] <scott_gonzalez> I thought for sure when I asked them to check `new Date()` that we'd get a weird response.
[09:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> Can't think of how else this would be broken.
[09:53:17] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Could it by any chance be a rounding error?
[09:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[13:31:04] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I can test on Ubuntu when I'm back in London (in Sept). Probably too late? 
[13:31:52] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It might still be open by then if nobody else can test.
[13:32:49] <agcolom> ok, let me know (I'll try to remember to ask when I'm back).
[15:58:56] <o88sun> hallo
[16:00:11] <o88sun> any help for issue?
