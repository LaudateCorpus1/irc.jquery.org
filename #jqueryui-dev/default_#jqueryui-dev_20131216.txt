[04:06:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[04:06:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[04:06:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! So, I've run several passes over 1-4, and rebasing without introducing merge errors is /really/ non-trivial.
[04:07:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I'm undertaking the painstaking approach of rebasing 1-4 over and over and over, making a single change, and making sure that the change survives the rebase without introducing diffs wrt. the original 1-4.
[04:07:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see, that's a lot of work
[04:07:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That way, commits that should go into both 1-3 and 1-4 gradually end up at the front, and 1-4-specific commits end up at the back.
[04:08:08] <uGoMobi> nice
[04:08:51] <_|Nix|_> I think for scheduling it may be better to release whatever we have and worry about cleaning up the repo after the release.
[04:09:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I thought we can't create 1-3 branch and merge 1-4 in master before this done
[04:11:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What I'm doing /is/ merging 1-4 into master.
[04:11:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In the process, a point appears that eventually becomes 1-3.
[04:12:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, because of the reorder
[04:12:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What I don't get is why the repo must be all nice and linear. Users only care about the deployed API docs, the CDN download, and a working DB.
[04:13:48] <_|Nix|_> I understand that, for future releases, it's nice to have  a linear repo 'n all, to generate the changelog and all that, but for now, we need to get this thing out the door.
[04:14:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's very hard to fix things afterwards
[04:14:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and often we don't make the time for it anymore
[04:15:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so it is important for us to keep repos in good health
[04:15:29] <_|Nix|_> I'm already making time for it. There's no way I'm gonna throw all this away just because we've released.
[04:16:05] <_|Nix|_> ... and I understand the importance of finishing this.
[04:16:22] <_|Nix|_> ... but I ask myself whether this should really be holding up the release.
[04:16:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure if arschmitz already mentioned it to you but for the same reason we are going to do ALL commits to the jquery-mobile repo via PR's
[04:17:24] <_|Nix|_> OK. Then I'll do my best.
[04:17:38] <_|Nix|_> The worst part is that this is something that git is really bad at.
[04:18:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is also some infrastructure work that needs to be done before the release
[04:18:08] <_|Nix|_> ... and this is the kind of work that cannot be distributed, because you're basically generating hundreds of branches containing hundreds of commits each.
[04:18:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: demos and themeroller have to be moved to a subdomain
[04:18:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So then what's the revised schedule?
[04:19:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't know yet how much time is needed to set that up
[04:43:22] <_|Nix|_> Argh ... this is terrible ... trying to move commits forward which contain bits where the theme swatches have been changed to conform to 1-4 end up modifying the theme values for 1-3 ... 
[04:51:26] <_|Nix|_> OK ... this is insane ... I basically have to re-apply each commit by hand ... 
[04:51:45] <_|Nix|_> I can't even try to cherry-pick ...
[04:54:16] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I guess I'll do that - but not now ... now I have to baby-sit ... 
[05:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: It sounds like you're making this harder than it should be.
[05:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> This cleanup isn't about changelog generation or anything like that.
[05:29:26] <scott_gonzalez> The reason this is important is because this will be maintained for a long time.
[05:29:33] <scott_gonzalez> And it needs to be sane to maintain.

[06:25:30] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: re licenses: so the license should just cover when the code was being written? (as opposed to used?)
[06:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yes. You can't change the license information for something that has already been released.
[06:26:23] <agcolom> ok, that's something I didn't know. But if some code gets added/modified, then the license needs to be changed?
[06:26:29] <agcolom> (updated?)
[06:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but not in that repo.
[06:26:52] <agcolom> ok. Thanks.

[08:45:59] <gseguin> uGoMobi: are we still planning on releasing today?
[08:51:16] <arschmitz> gseguin: i dont think so we need some new infra setup first
[08:51:47] <gseguin> for?
[08:51:59] <arschmitz> demos and themeroller
[08:52:09] <gseguin> oh yeah yeah, I remember now
[08:52:17] <gseguin> any update on that?
[08:52:20] <arschmitz> no

[10:36:18] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: Do you know which email address Jason Scott wants us to use? He signed the CLA twice :-/
[10:43:11] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: not sure, but I would pick the RIM address
[10:46:32] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Is there a way to annotate the record indicating that the other email address is an alternate?
[10:46:54] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Yes, it's already done.
[10:46:56] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: Hyunsook signed twice too, last time with her full name
[10:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, updated the first, deleted the second.
[11:01:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ping
[11:01:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Pong!
[11:02:06] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[11:02:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you in contact with gnarf about the ThemeRoller?
[11:03:10] <arschmitz> kinda i need to check in with him about timeline but i pinged him friday and scott told him what we needed
[11:03:27] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:03:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just want to make sure that we know when the setup is ready :)
[11:03:51] <arschmitz> i just pinged him again to see if he knows when things well be setup
[11:04:16] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[11:04:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: down to under 800 commits in changelog lol
[11:05:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nice
[11:05:07] <uGoMobi> hell of a job :(
[11:05:16] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:05:31] <arschmitz> i got them all sorted and now im going through one commit at a time
[11:05:45] <arschmitz> and deciding its worthiness 
[11:05:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: at least you will know everything we done for 1.4
[11:05:59] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:06:18] <arschmitz> then i need to go through to clean up the wording and formatting and stuff
[11:06:26] <arschmitz> ha ha true
[11:07:13] <arschmitz> have to actually look at a lot of the commits too before telling if they are worthy because the message is not clear
[11:07:36] <arschmitz> we also have a lot of stuff that was reverted so that should not go in
[11:08:25] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:13:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just talked to gnarf and im going to start getting those setup
[11:13:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: everything via PR's, rebase branches, new commit message guideline... things will get better! :)
[11:13:13] <uGoMobi> (forgot to enter)
[11:13:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok great
[11:13:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol yes it will be much much better for 1.4.x and 1.5
[11:15:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I just looked at your convo with Corey on the infrastructure channel
[11:15:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool
[11:15:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so we need to setup repo's
[11:15:57] <uGoMobi> theme roller already has a repo
[11:16:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes i already asked scott to when he has a sec
[11:16:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no site repos
[11:16:11] <uGoMobi> or do we need another one to make this work?
[11:16:23] <arschmitz> like themeroller.jquerymobile.com
[11:16:30] <uGoMobi> right
[11:16:31] <arschmitz> has to be the repo
[11:16:37] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:17:02] <uGoMobi> and they are already there :)
[13:25:34] <_|Nix|_> Yaaay! The easy part's done ... I've migrated the commits that relevant to both 1-3 and 1-4!
[14:01:16] <_|Nix|_> s/that/that are/
[15:05:07] <gseguin> arschmitz: so the demos repo is set up
[15:05:15] <gseguin> do you want me to populate it?
[15:06:27] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ^

[16:38:25] <arschmitz> gseguin: no i got it
[19:17:32] <gseguin> arschmitz: one thing is you might want to rename the directories to comply with semver
