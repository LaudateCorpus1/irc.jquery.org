[22:01:09] <jsharpminor> Hi! I have some sample code here: http://jsbin.com/vowayac/1/edit?html,css,output
[22:01:20] <jsharpminor> I'm using jquery-ui-draggable.
[22:02:24] <jsharpminor> I'd like to make it so that when I drag one of the <tr> items, a child of <tr>, it also grabs the nth-through-xth <td> that is of class runSegment and moves that as well.
[22:02:53] <jsharpminor> In other words, I want a multi-Draggable that selects its higher-numbered siblings on the fly.
[22:03:13] <jsharpminor> I've seen multi-Draggable classes, but they usually require you to preselect which items you want to drag.
[22:03:42] <jsharpminor> I don't really know how to do what I'm after, and I don't mind learning, but I'm stuck at about the part where I don't know where to start in the "start:" event.
