[04:46:32] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: My comment had a typo. I wrote narrow when I meant short.
[04:46:44] <rxaviers> ah ;)
[04:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> I updated my comment and deleted the other interpretation part of your comment.
[04:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> Just to avoid confusion when re-reading the comments.
[04:47:00] <rxaviers> ok
[04:48:01] <rxaviers> Very much probably that docs are wrong in this matter
[04:48:07] <rxaviers> probable
[04:48:21] <rxaviers> I will consider this in the meanwhile :)

[05:33:36] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi: _|Nix|_:
[05:33:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: morning
[05:34:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what did you think of the plugin for nested listviews
[05:35:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it's nice!
[05:36:10] <arschmitz> gives lots of options depending on the use case
[05:36:20] <uGoMobi> yes, exactly
[05:36:22] <arschmitz> and all but 2 require nothing more then 2 or 3 css rules
[05:36:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ asked me to changed the listview CSS
[05:36:52] <uGoMobi> so it doesn't affect nested list
[05:37:03] <arschmitz> the ones that generate pages require a small plugin 
[05:37:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i didnt see what he was talking about when i was working on it but the css would make that happen
[05:37:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont think the changes will effect what i did
[05:38:06] <uGoMobi> ok, just wanted to check that
[05:38:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah should be fine and if it does ill just update
[05:39:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_ example i think was a little over complicated it adds a good size extension and a LOT of css to do essentially same thing mine does with 2 or 3 rules
[05:39:47] <arschmitz> and no js
[05:40:28] <arschmitz> well no added js it just uses data-role='collapsible' and data-role="listview" to make it work
[05:42:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if deffinitly works just think its a little complicated
[05:43:06] <uGoMobi> I think the JS example should show the easiest way to get old nested listview behaviour
[05:43:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool i think mine does that
[05:43:39] <arschmitz> and its configurable to do custom callbacks and url keys
[05:43:51] <arschmitz> if you want something more complicated
[05:44:31] <arschmitz> but out of the box all you need to do is add &ui-list to the link and add data-role="listview" to the inner listview so its enhanced
[05:45:01] <arschmitz> and being a plugin you can just drop it in 
[05:45:12] <uGoMobi> i remember having a listview inside a listview used to cause an error
[05:45:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i decided to open a repo for it so people can file issues
[05:45:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah not any more 
[05:45:54] <uGoMobi> was probably because of nested listview code
[05:46:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and i mean i could remove the need to add data-role on inner just figured semantically it makes sense to add it. 
[05:46:36] <uGoMobi> yeah I agree
[05:47:00] <uGoMobi> next to the JS solution we can add a pure CSS nested list demo
[05:47:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah my demo has both
[05:47:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: though i might break up for actual demos demo
[05:47:55] <uGoMobi> yes, wanted to suggest that
[05:48:05] <uGoMobi> otherwise might be confusing
[05:48:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i wrote the whole plugin from scratch in jsbin lol
[05:48:33] <uGoMobi> I know, just saying
[05:48:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yea no i agree on breaking it up
[05:49:08] <uGoMobi> with the CSS there are different styles possible of course
[05:49:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup these are just one simple option
[05:49:45] <uGoMobi> I think we should do just one
[05:50:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i wanted to make it as simple as possible all 7 variations use a grand combined total of 5 rules
[05:50:12] <arschmitz> and no rule has more then 2 lines lol
[05:50:39] <uGoMobi> if you can show it one demo  and still make clear what rule is used for what
[05:51:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have found that most rule-space is occupied by when to turn off borders so you don't end up with two side-by-side.
[05:51:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah iv been thinking about that
[05:51:30] <uGoMobi> was just thinking about maintenance... if we have multiple nested list CSS demos, we have to update a lot if we make a change in the listview CSS :/
[05:52:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know ... I'm fine with dropping mine.
[05:52:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah best to keep as simple as possible
[05:52:30] <_|Nix|_> I would like to make sure though that the raw-material for the demo is a plain HTML nested list.
[05:52:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think you missunderstand my demo
[05:53:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it just gives one example of how you can do a json based list
[05:53:26] <arschmitz> everything else is plaine html
[05:53:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So I was thinking that we could do this the enhanced=true/false way: That is, when enhanced=false, we take the nested list, rip it apart, generate pages and link anchors via the click handler.
[05:53:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont think we should add anything to library
[05:53:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but if you put the pages in the original markup then it's only a nested list in A/B-grade browsers.
[05:54:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, definitely not the library, but the JS for the demo.
[05:54:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The JS in the demo rips apart a nested list and creates pages.
[05:54:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In your demo, the pages are part of the original markup.
[05:54:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it does not rip anything apart
[05:54:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it simply hides original list clones it and makes a page from it
[05:55:12] <arschmitz> so on c grade it will just be normal nested lists like its always been in c grade
[05:56:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... on http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/284/ you have things like <div data-role="page">...<div data-role="content"><ul data-role="listview"><li>RLX</li>...</ul></div>
[05:56:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That looks to me like you're doing the ripping apart a priori. Or was that just an example?
[05:56:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that just showing you can do nothing and use multi-page template
[05:56:44] <arschmitz> and have one list link to a page
[05:56:53] <arschmitz> if you notice it says no css and no js needed
[05:57:28] <arschmitz> the first list just links to another page with another list
[05:57:50] <arschmitz> so in c grade you would click it and it would jump down the page to the other list
[05:58:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. That's why I think our demo should include JS that generates these pages from a nested list.
[05:58:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and enhancement step.
[05:58:13] <_|Nix|_> s/and/an/
[05:58:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: these are OPTIONS people can do how they want
[05:58:38] <arschmitz> having seperate pages is a perfectly valid option to emulate old nested lists
[05:58:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed completely.
[05:58:51] <arschmitz> and its the simpliest option as it requires nothing
[05:59:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Still, if we give too many options, the demo will become very complex.
[06:00:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and, like uGoMobi said, if we have too many demos, it'll be a lengthy maintenance process to update them for listview changes.
[06:00:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there is nothing to maintain with that
[06:00:43] <arschmitz> there is nothing special
[06:00:48] <arschmitz> its just pages
[06:00:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know I know - in the do-nothing case.
[06:01:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But your demo also illustrates other options - like doing collapsibles, for example.
[06:01:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes we have an open issue for this as well
[06:01:53] <arschmitz> and it requires only 3 css rules
[06:01:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I also modified my demo to produce collapsibles, and I've found that you need some very specific rules to turn off borders.
[06:02:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that was not a problem that i ran into
[06:02:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but your demo has a length extension i dont feel is needed for collapsibles
[06:02:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: length extension?
[06:03:03] <arschmitz> lengthy 
[06:03:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: when you can do it by just addint a data-role
[06:03:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's true. The point of my extension is to convert a plain HTML nested list to a collapsible-based nested list.
[06:04:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, in this sense, your demo is enhaced=true, whereas mine is enhanced=false
[06:04:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : I think we should keep demos simple, don't combine too much in one demo
[06:04:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Agreed.
[06:04:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: this is still plain html and why do we need to auto enhance them i dont see the point just tell people to add the role
[06:05:43] <uGoMobi> so we will have a collapsible list items demo, a nested listview JS demo (just the JS what's needed to get the old behaviour), and a nested CSS demo
[06:06:02] <uGoMobi> s/nested CSS/nested listview CSS/
[06:06:52] <_|Nix|_> OK. If people add their own data-role then that's cool. Even less JS.
[06:08:13] <_|Nix|_> I wanna see if it's possible to maintain the stepped look with collapsibles.
[06:08:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: mine is steped 
[06:09:29] <arschmitz> oh oops i was working on this late one is missing a rule for the stepped one that makes it stepped
[06:09:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The collapsible variant on https://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/284 is not.
[06:09:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Cool!
[06:10:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess I spend a lot of rule-space turning left borders back on for stepped-in (indented) lists.
[06:11:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What little sense of aesthetics I have seems to be irked by the fact that you have list item separators terminating into the middle of the collapsible content.
[06:11:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, if the wiser UI PTB out there are OK with that, well, WORKSFORME.
[06:12:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6399
[06:12:44] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6399 by rbu (4h 48m ago): There is no API to determine if an element is initialized
[06:13:06] <uGoMobi> is it just me or... why not use .ui-listview as selector
[06:13:13] <uGoMobi> or :mobile-listview
[06:13:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: :mobile-listview can cause errors
[06:13:28] <uGoMobi> or bind to listviewcreate
[06:13:31] <arschmitz> but ui-listview is fine
[06:13:41] <uGoMobi> why can that cause errors?
[06:13:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah and either way this would be widget factory / ui not us
[06:13:58] <arschmitz> listview extension is not loaded
[06:14:02] <arschmitz> its an invalid selector
[06:14:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: fixed the inset
[06:14:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[06:14:25] <uGoMobi> ah ok, I see the difference
[06:15:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: :data(mobileListview)
[06:15:48] <arschmitz> is the right way to do that and not worry about errors
[06:16:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit see scott's comment on 17
[06:17:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ass far as border im tossed i honestly dont like the look when you add the left border but i think it does look slightly off terminating at nothing
[06:18:14] <arschmitz> as* lol
[06:20:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: swear i was not calling you names lol!
[06:20:23] <_|Nix|_> :)
[06:21:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: something i think im going to open an issue for 
[06:21:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we should not use $.mobile.document and $.mobile.window in widgets
[06:23:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it makes them rely on jquery.mobile.helpers
[06:23:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and you can just use this.window and this.document
[06:23:44] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi closed issue #6399: There is no API to determine if an element is initialized  02http://git.io/mNvLHg
[06:23:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its even shorter
[06:24:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: True. I guess when we introduced that we didn't know about/yet have this.window and this.document
[06:24:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it was there and i knew i just didnt actually think of it
[06:25:18] <arschmitz> i was like thinking more about consistency then dependencies 
[06:25:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, that's something we can sweep away.
[06:25:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. Well, that's even more consistent.
[06:26:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah its simple enough to fix just was thinking about it that we need to fix that
[06:26:14] <arschmitz> since im pretty sure most of the widgets dont rely on core
[06:26:21] <arschmitz> or helpers
[06:26:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[06:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6399#issuecomment-23335133 NEVER use camel case.
[06:26:59] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #6399 by rbu (5h 2m ago): There is no API to determine if an element is initialized
[06:27:07] <scott_gonzalez> The data key is mobile-listview, not mobileListview.
[06:27:16] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats my fault 
[06:27:37] <arschmitz> im pretty sure he copied and pasted me and i was not paying attention when i typed oit
[06:28:06] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i always forget about instance method
[06:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, try to stay with dashed names in the future.
[06:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> Camel case just adds to the confusion.
[06:28:31] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ok clear, thanks
[06:28:35] <scott_gonzalez> I see it all the time in forum responses from random people and it makes me cringe every time.
[06:28:46] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah i didnt actually mean to type it that was was having 2 conversations at same time should have paid more attention :(
[06:30:22] <uGoMobi> I wanted to update but someone beat me to it 
[06:46:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: +1 ... we've had errors with mobilePage before. We had to change the code to mobile-page.
[06:46:45] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: That was me :-)
[06:46:52] <uGoMobi> thanks :)
[07:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: The subpixel BS with menu is more obvious when scrolling through selectmenu with arrow keys.
[07:11:16] <gseguin> mornin'
[07:12:32] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that's still only an issue at zoom though, right?
[07:12:38] <kborchers> not at 100%
[07:12:53] <kborchers> i agree it sucks but don't have a good solution at the moment
[07:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> nope, at 100%.
[07:15:28] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/demos/selectmenu/default.html
[07:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> Click on the last menu and then use the down arrow.
[07:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> You'll notice that when you reach the bottom, the height of the active element randomly changes.
[07:16:17] <scott_gonzalez> But the bottom border is always in the exact same spot.
[07:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> It's a pixel rounding issue with the browser.
[07:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> The same is true if you're scrolling up.
[07:16:57] <scott_gonzalez> The top border is always in the same place, but the height randomly changes.
[07:19:47] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: OHHHH iv had issues with that in widgets before
[07:20:00] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: iv found some totally insane workarounds for it though
[07:20:19] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: well only insane in that they actually work
[07:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:21:28] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: like adding an integer to the calculated value
[07:21:55] <arschmitz> made it go from jumping like mad to rock solid
[07:22:47] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ill see if i can find the issue with the fix if you think it would be helpful
[07:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that'd be good.
[07:24:19] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ehh i dont have access to the repo any more :( 
[07:25:57] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: pretty sure though i just added an integer to the calculated value because it was covered by another element so +- 5 px did not matter. 
[07:26:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: in this case you cant do that
[07:26:14] <arschmitz> but you might try adding 1 then subtracting or something
[07:26:40] <arschmitz> totally insane i know but it fixed it
[07:26:44] <RWhitbeck> Launched the conference mobile site I've been working on with Alpha 2 https://twitter.com/appendTo/status/372360591928610817
[07:26:45] <b-ot> RWhitbeck: @appendTo: Heading to #devLink tomorrow? Check out the conference mobile site we built http://t.co/NVx8SGPZah
[07:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean by adding it to the calculated value?
[07:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> You mean using JS to change the value?
[07:27:31] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: scott_gonzalez i have not looked at the exact case in menu but does it use a calulated height anywhere
[07:28:08] <arschmitz> in this case it was a calculated width for a highlight
[07:28:12] <scott_gonzalez> RWhitbeck: That is a lot of clicking to view the schedule.
[07:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. It's just the height of the content.
[07:28:44] <arschmitz> oh....
[07:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually really confusing that this problem exists.
[07:28:55] <scott_gonzalez> We don't do anything crazy with the values.
[07:28:57] <arschmitz> yeah not the same case 
[07:29:07] <arschmitz> mine was specificly about calculated values
[07:29:19] <scott_gonzalez> The only values that change are border and margin, and both are integer values.
[07:29:50] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: hmmm...
[07:30:16] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: you might try using an external header since it never changes
[07:30:32] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: same with footer
[07:30:40] <RWhitbeck> they're templated
[07:31:20] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: advantage to external is only content transitions and header and footer stay solid and they only need to be enhanced and downloaded once
[07:31:47] <RWhitbeck> do you have a link to an example?
[07:32:00] <arschmitz> yup just a sec
[07:32:49] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...this might be a bug in Mobile, but the site is broken :-/

[07:51:46] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: you just place the header and footer in the body instead of inside the page
[07:53:08] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: same thing with your nav panel
[07:53:41] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: then each time you generate a page you just generate the page div and content and dont need to worry about header footer and panel
[07:56:20] <RWhitbeck> well crap that is much better then the stupid solution I came up with. 
[07:56:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do you have the latest and greatest nested-listview-using-collapsibles somewhere? I managed to get it done without extra JS, but you need to instantiate the listviews and the collapsibles with specific options, 9 CSS rules, and a class that identifies the outermost listview :/ http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/nested-listview.html
[07:56:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you have a repo I can look at, I can try to test your version with the nested list I've been using to shake out all the border issues.
[07:57:11] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/284/edit
[07:57:14] <arschmitz> is demo
[07:57:24] <arschmitz> link to the repo in the demo
[07:57:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Thanks!
[07:58:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll concentrate on the doing-it-via-collapsibles portion.
[07:58:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: all the collapsibles use is a couple css rules
[07:58:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. I'm noticing for example that, in the demo, adjacent collapsibles have a double border. So, that'll likely need a rule.
[08:00:01] <arschmitz> oh yeah when they are open you get it 
[08:00:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: feel free to open issues or prs or anything on that repo
[08:00:53] <arschmitz> im just thinking putting in a repo makes it so we are not commited to maintain its then "3rd party"
[08:01:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I see - you did what I did - you introduced class listview-collapsible.
[08:01:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I called it ui-li-has-sublist :)
[08:02:01] <arschmitz> and people can file issues feature requests whatever in the repo and not bug us about it ( well they would still bug me but whatever lol )
[08:02:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes to negate margins
[08:02:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You can do that with selectors though: .ui-li-static.ui-collapsible ...
[08:02:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, I absolutely needed a class to mark the outermost listview :(
[08:03:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: didnt want to limit people too much what if you want a regular old like inset collapsible as part of a listview and nothign about nested
[08:04:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess that's true. That may be worth a new class.
[08:04:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Makes for shorter selectors, too.
[08:04:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup i was really going for simplicity here
[08:05:02] <arschmitz> and the whole thing does not need to be part of jqm demos
[08:05:25] <arschmitz> i just wanted a repo / plugin focused around nested options for listviews.
[08:05:53] <arschmitz> and we can use for demos we want and ill make the rest of the demos either in the repo or linked from it
[08:16:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: really do welcome your input on this repo though
[08:16:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: still a few things i know about in the plugin i want to change for sure
[08:27:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I got part-ways: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/arschmitz-nested.html
[08:28:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Some really funky stuff going on with the left and right margins.
[08:28:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i didnt have the issues im seeing there
[08:28:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... at least in the non-indented case. If you indent, it's all good.
[08:28:50] <arschmitz> not sure whats different didnt realy look into it 
[08:29:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I added a second level of collapsibled.
[08:29:06] <_|Nix|_> collapsibles.
[08:29:24] <arschmitz> hmm should still work but did not actually try something might conflict there
[08:30:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Might also be my plastering two of them side-by-side.
[08:30:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll get rid of that.
[08:30:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not sure
[08:30:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: would be nice to add a rule for the left border if people want it 
[08:30:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: personally im not a fan but im sure a lot of people would want it
[08:30:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You mean the indentation?
[08:31:01] <arschmitz> no
[08:31:06] <arschmitz> just actually having the border
[08:31:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, the stepping of the left border.
[08:31:15] <arschmitz> the indentation is already its own class
[08:31:38] <arschmitz> its .ui-listview-nested-push or something if i recall to make it indented 
[08:31:55] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[08:32:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but would like to be able to add another class to add the left border 
[08:32:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. That left border is a killer.
[08:33:08] <arschmitz> have to see if its possible to distill it down to a class toggle
[08:33:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Especially if you don't want it continuing where there are child lists.
[08:33:41] <_|Nix|_> Like, if you don't want to end up with ||||| child list item.
[08:34:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats why if we could just add a class to add remove it would be nice
[08:34:12] <arschmitz> like for each individual ul
[08:34:43] <arschmitz> so add .ui-listview-nested-push-border or something crazy like that to add the left border to the list
[08:34:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[08:35:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can try that in my demo. After all, I'm more familiar with it :)
[08:35:42] <arschmitz> yeah if you get it to work you should do a PR on my repo and ill pull it in
[08:35:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But first I'll replace .ui-li-static.ui-collapsible with your class.
[08:51:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: actually rule was super simple
[08:51:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: added it to the repo
[08:51:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile-nestedlists/commit/a72de9e9604c76ed9ee27bf37103642f250d8a5b
[08:51:29] <b-ot> arschmitz: Alexander Schmitz (2m 42s ago): Added class for adding a left border to pushed indented lists
[08:52:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and check cadillac section at http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/284/edit
[08:54:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!

[11:18:19] <rxaviers> good to know
[12:42:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thanks for the PR merged it 
[13:14:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ummm ... there's more ...
[13:15:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: One more rule to flatten left/right borders.
[13:15:18] <arschmitz> ok
[13:15:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll make another PR.
[13:17:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You can probably just pull from my repo.
[13:18:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: git pull git@github.com:gabrielschulhof/jquery-mobile-nestedlists.git additional-rules
[13:18:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: either way
[13:18:23] <arschmitz> ok
[13:18:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This places us in a state where there are no side borders at all.
[13:20:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and the fact that there are no side borders hides the fact that there's a little bit of extra padding above the listview inside the .ui-collapsible-content
[13:20:23] <arschmitz> cool
[13:20:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... however, if I set padding-top to 0, then things start to overlap.
[13:20:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't get why that's happening.
[13:20:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but it will prevent us from adding side borders.
[13:21:00] <arschmitz> not sure ill ill have to look at it
[13:21:09] <arschmitz> working on my presentation for austin right now
[13:21:21] <arschmitz> trying to make a jqm 1.4 theme for Keynote lol
[13:21:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird that I never ran into this padding problem with my demo.
[13:21:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good stuff. I'm hoping to talk about 1.4.0 by the time SFO rolls around (Oct 22nd)
[13:21:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah not sure you ran into a bunch of problems i didnt though too
[13:22:06] <arschmitz> SFO?
[13:22:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. That HTML5 Developers' Conference.
[13:22:32] <arschmitz> oh yeah
[13:22:43] <_|Nix|_> Lessee how far we get in a month.
[13:23:03] <_|Nix|_> I'll have to cut it off at some point and just start writing.
[13:23:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im talking about 1.4 in austin
[13:24:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess I'm hoping it'll be out by then.
[13:25:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... either way though, I'll be talking about the journey :)
[13:25:44] <arschmitz> id been hoping it would be for austin but oh well
[13:25:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I don't mean the plane ride :)
[13:26:08] <arschmitz> ha
[13:26:20] <asheppard> arschmitz: i've been using jQM itself as my presentation software
[13:26:37] <arschmitz> asheppard: yeah iv thought about doing that
[13:26:40] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: I intend to do likewhise.
[13:27:27] <asheppard> the transitions work pretty well for that
[13:27:56] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: Not to mention inline demos.
[13:28:27] <asheppard> exactly
[13:28:49] <asheppard> throw in an appcache in case of spotty connection
[13:28:50] <arschmitz> asheppard: yeah i just don't want to write html and css for it lol
[13:28:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you're busy with the preso I'll make another PR for that commit.
[13:28:59] <asheppard> i've been working on a configurable markdown/yaml presentation  builder
[13:29:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://localhost/
[13:29:13] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: ^
[13:29:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry!
[13:29:22] <arschmitz> ha ha
[13:29:32] <_|Nix|_> You guys and your nicks all starting with "a" ... 
[13:30:08] <gseguin> arschmitz: how does it look like for a release this week?
[13:30:27] <arschmitz> gseguin: im not sure id check with uGoMobi hes doing major stuff to demos right now
[13:30:36] <asheppard> _|Nix|_: localhost is another option, though i usually use a tablet for presentations now
[13:31:23] <gseguin> ok
[13:32:53] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: Man, don't get me started on those things ... the other day I realized my phone doesn't have a camera timer. So, I look online on how to make a timer work, and I get this: gst-launch v4l2src ! ffmpegcolorspace ! pngenc ! filesink location=$1.png
[13:33:07] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: Bang! Open a terminal, and there it is. No app store, no app, nothing.
[13:33:22] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: That's what I want in a phone.
[13:33:42] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: None of this trudging through a myriad of BS apps.
[13:34:43] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: The day when a Linux distro will once more run on smartphones is the day I will finally lay to rest my trusty N900.
[13:35:29] <asheppard> _|Nix|_: yeah it will be interesting to see how far ubuntu gets
[13:35:39] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: Agreed.
[13:36:10] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: Of course, if they start locking it down, they'll be no better than everyone else, so ...
[13:36:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i pushed your changes
[13:36:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[13:42:43] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... a really braindead rendering glitch in Chrome ... I add a <p>Small text</p> to a collapsible heading in one top-level ul, and it breaks the other top-level ul further down the page!
[13:43:22] <_|Nix|_> FF doesn't even flinch, of course.
[13:45:06] <_|Nix|_> Maybe it's time to update Chrome :/
[13:47:03] <asheppard> _|Nix|_: so here's my jQM yaml/markdown presentation builder http://ta.wq.io/
[13:47:34] <asheppard> _|Nix|_: kind of rough around the edges but has "potential"
[13:48:38] <asheppard> _|Nix|_: also stuck on jQM 1.3.1 at the moment
[13:55:28] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: I know the feeling. I also have a library I need to drag into the 1.4.x era.
[14:05:29] <asheppard> _|Nix|_: yeah looking forward to incorporating the new stuff when i get a chance
[15:19:36] <_zoggy_> hmm
[15:20:20] <_zoggy_> so on 1.10.3, if you load up a dialog with buttons, then drag the dialog to the bottom of the screen.. it 'pushes' the viewpoint longer than what it is.. thus making the page have scrollbar
[15:20:53] <_zoggy_> if you nuke the resize handles, and try it. it stops at the edge with no scrollbars being added
[15:21:21] <_zoggy_> on 1.8.24 the scrollbar didnt happen with resize handles
[15:30:58] <_zoggy_> posted bug
[15:31:08] <_zoggy_> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9521
[15:34:17] <_zoggy_> i noticed in the new update, the dialog previous position is used.. is there an option to not do that and revert the previous way? didnt know if im just over looking it
[17:35:28] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: You can set the position option before opening.
[17:50:33] <scott_gonzalez> wow: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkBVAi3oKvo&feature=youtu.be
[18:11:53] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, i did... but that only works on the first time. all the times after that it uses the new coord if its been resized/moved
