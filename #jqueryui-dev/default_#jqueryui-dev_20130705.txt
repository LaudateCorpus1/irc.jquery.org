[06:36:12] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: here
[06:36:14] <jzaefferer> sup?
[06:36:27] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: what's lolable?
[06:38:42] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: hi
[06:39:42] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: more then anything just wanted to thank you for looking at those PR's
[06:40:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ has only been on the team a little over a year and i have been coming up on a year so having your input is great
[06:46:03] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: thanks, the confirmation helps. Don't want to make the impression of yelling at people for nothing :-)
[06:46:36] <arschmitz> not not at all if theres a better way to do something i want to know so i can do it
[06:46:49] <arschmitz> im under no delusion that i do everything right :)
[06:47:21] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: you're welcome to ping me on any PRs you create, or others from the team
[06:47:33] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: awesome great to know
[06:47:37] <jzaefferer> I don't want to dilute my attention too much, so I'm not subscribing to the repo (yet)
[06:47:44] <jzaefferer> so manual notifications to issues or PRs help
[06:47:52] <arschmitz> lol great
[06:48:56] <jzaefferer> I'm not in a good position to review PRs from other contributors, since I really can't judge if they are valid in the first place
[06:48:56] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: since your the man when it comes to testing we have 2 tests i might ask your attention on when i get to them they fail randomly and it makes our travis notifications essentially meaningless
[06:49:13] <jzaefferer> okay
[06:49:19] <jzaefferer> do they fail outside of travis?
[06:49:28] <arschmitz>  no not that iv ever seen :(
[06:49:46] <arschmitz> they are async tests and based on the results my feeling is its a race condtion
[06:50:12] <jzaefferer> yay
[06:50:16] <arschmitz> but hard to do any real work on since i cant make them fail local
[06:50:36] <jzaefferer> Are they super valuable? Otherwise just disable them for now.
[06:51:40] <arschmitz> they are not valueble at all if you cant trust the results 
[06:51:40] <arschmitz> in my oppinion anyway
[06:53:37] <jzaefferer> Sure, but assuming they actually work
[06:55:34] <arschmitz> true it does work local
[06:55:40] <arschmitz> so it does "work" 
[08:53:41] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jacklol13 opened issue #6136: Page not resizing properly after scroll and orientation change  02http://git.io/psCVPg
[09:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG. Successful discussion about AMD!!!!1111
[09:18:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! When you get a quick minute, could you please have a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6135? It's the PR for the popup widget review. I hope I hit all the points.
[09:19:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Dunno how we're doing the merging of all these branches, either. Like, your checkboxradio branch. That's not yet merged, right? Can we not merge it?
[09:19:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: have you seen all the comments from myself jzaefferer and scott_gonzalez?
[09:19:57] * _|Nix|_ should probably refresh the tab *scratch head*
[09:21:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have a few minor things to fix in my branches but i can commit them all today
[09:21:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: did you see im removing the mobile base widget?
[09:23:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool!
[09:24:06] <arschmitz> yeah after talking to scott_gonzalez im instead extending $.Widget
[09:24:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I kinda agree with jzaefferer ... "class" is bad ... ummm ... wrapperClasses?
[09:24:12] <arschmitz> so all widgets get the mobile methods
[09:24:20] <arschmitz> yeah i made a comment to same effect on there
[09:24:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sounds good ...
[09:24:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so should I rename that option?
[09:24:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is wrapperClasses the one true option name for classes to be applied to the wrapper?
[09:24:58] <arschmitz> yeah i just had not decided to what yet
[09:25:10] <arschmitz> makes sense its just long
[09:25:41] <arschmitz> but its semantic so i guess we can go with that
[09:25:42] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... what to call it ...
[09:25:47] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[09:26:00] <_|Nix|_> Well, we can save two bytes by saying wrapperClass
[09:26:03] <arschmitz> always better to be clear on what an option does
[09:26:17] <arschmitz> ehh that implies you can only set 1 class
[09:26:29] <arschmitz> but its a class string that can include as many as you want
[09:26:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No ... people are used to class="abc def ghi" ...
[09:26:39] <arschmitz> true
[09:26:46] <arschmitz> yeah sold wrapper-class
[09:26:46] <_|Nix|_> Exactly.
[09:26:56] <_|Nix|_> Cool. Done.
[09:27:20] <_|Nix|_> Now, what do we call markup that does not need to be modified in order to be considered enhanced.
[09:27:38] <_|Nix|_> "Pre-enhaced" seems to cause confusion ...
[09:28:00] <arschmitz> enhanced
[09:28:04] <arschmitz> i agree with jorn there
[09:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> We've generally used the term "pre-rendered" in our UI discussions.
[09:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> They are, in fact, not pre-enhanced.
[09:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> There is no such thing.
[09:28:20] <arschmitz> true
[09:28:32] <arschmitz> pre-rendered i thing makes sense
[09:28:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so let's used pre-rendered in our docs.
[09:28:52] <arschmitz> yup
[09:29:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think if each widgets includes a last section like I've made for popup, then that'll make it pretty clear what we mean.
[09:29:15] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so i made the changes we talked about wednesday with the mobile base widget and the rise method
[09:29:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes i think they will need to include a clear structure of what we expect
[09:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:30:09] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: didnt break a single thing
[09:30:12] <arschmitz> very clean
[09:30:16] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:30:27] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and rise was not used a single place in the whole lib total wasted method
[09:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> I hope you searched for raise not rise :-P
[09:30:56] <arschmitz> lol i did
[09:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> Is this in a branch or just local?
[09:32:21] <_|Nix|_> rise? WTF is rise?
[09:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-mobile has a ton of branches.
[09:32:31] <_|Nix|_> We have a method called "rise"?
[09:32:37] <_|Nix|_> s/have/had/
[09:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: .raise() in mobile.widget.
[09:32:44] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Oh.
[09:32:59] <_|Nix|_> Oh, that thing ... it's supposed to throw a pretty error.
[09:33:02] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: its in a branch https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6133/files#r5040938
[09:36:04] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz _|Nix|_ 
[09:36:32] <arschmitz> hey uGoMobi
[09:36:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I m gonna work on ext-panels css this weekend
[09:37:03] <arschmitz> awesome
[09:37:26] <arschmitz> i have a few minor js tweaks i need to make there ill try and get them in today / tonight but should not really effect what your doing
[09:37:40] <arschmitz> i have SOOOOO many branches to merge lol
[09:37:42] <arschmitz> :(
[09:38:11] <_|Nix|_> OK. So, it's "pre-rendering" according to wikipedia. That is, both http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prerendering and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-rendering take you to a page titled "Pre-rendering".
[09:38:19] <_|Nix|_> So, I'm going with the hyphenated version.
[09:38:56] <arschmitz> cool
[09:42:41] <uGoMobi_> grr IRCCloud :(
[09:44:06] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: yeah would be nice if we can merge some of those branches beginning next week
[09:44:25] <arschmitz> yeah ill be mergeing 3 or 4 today probably
[09:44:41] <arschmitz> since jzaefferer was nice enough to review them
[09:45:10] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: did i need to look at new flip switch widget CSS too?
[09:45:58] <arschmitz> yeah js needs finishing but css is good to go
[09:46:06] <arschmitz> for review that is
[09:46:19] <arschmitz> im sure you will change it all :)
[09:46:27] <uGoMobi_> lol why?
[09:46:51] <uGoMobi_> anyway, i will give it a look this weekend
[09:46:52] <arschmitz> lol no real reason 
[09:46:57] <uGoMobi_> ok :)
[09:47:09] <arschmitz> because your better at css then i am basicly
[09:47:17] <arschmitz> there is probably a better way to do same thing 
[09:49:24] <uGoMobi_> i hope i can reduce some of the 3D-ing in panels
[09:50:29] <arschmitz> that would be a big gain
[09:51:14] <uGoMobi_> do you think it's possible to not wrap toolbars and content, just animate the page?
[09:52:17] <arschmitz> with external or internal?
[09:52:30] <arschmitz> external just uses the page and animates it
[09:52:45] <arschmitz> because its essentially the same as wrapping content and toolbars
[09:54:45] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: I mean the content-wrap
[09:55:02] <uGoMobi_> if I look here http://view.jquerymobile.com/ext-panels/demos/widgets/accordions/ I still see the wrapper
[09:55:30] <arschmitz> ah yeah thats a normal internal panel
[09:55:44] <arschmitz> so nothing has really changed there
[09:56:13] <uGoMobi_> ah, so it's different if the panel is outside the page?
[09:56:15] <arschmitz> we should make it an external one in that case for docs since its common to all pages
[09:56:18] <arschmitz> yes
[09:56:27] <arschmitz> if the panel is outside the page it just uses the page
[09:56:36] <arschmitz> if its inside the page it works the same as before
[09:57:12] <uGoMobi_> i see
[09:57:38] <arschmitz> we can change that if you have an idea to make it work better
[09:57:58] <uGoMobi_> yeah might be worth looking into
[09:58:26] <uGoMobi_> i will try some things this weekend and let you know
[09:58:31] <arschmitz> i just didnt want to mess with it because i know you had done a lot of work on that and didnt want to mess with it
[09:59:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: if you want to loop me in while your working this weekend feel free to send me an email and ill get to a computer
[10:00:05] <uGoMobi_> ok great
[10:00:43] <uGoMobi_> ok dinner time... be back later

[10:20:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Reviewers' comments officially heeded. Can you please give https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6135 another look-see to see whether I've missed anything else?
[10:28:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no problem im eating lunch now will look after
[10:31:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome! Thanks!
[10:43:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: D'oh ... hold off on that ... forgot to rename to wrapperClass ...
[10:44:37] <_|Nix|_> ... and, to top it off, I'm upgrading to Fedora 19 on my main machine, so I'm installing cygwin on my Windoze machine to maybe squeeze in the move to wrapperClass while my main machine is upgrading.
[10:56:41] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: no need for thank-yous in commit message. Better to actually describe the change you're doing :-)
[11:05:33] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: I did, in a bulleted list below the top line.
[11:06:04] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: It's a bunch of varied changes, so it would've made the commit message too long.
[11:06:58] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: I suppose I couldve broken it up :/
[11:07:36] <_|Nix|_> Man ... cygwin+rxvt is not too bad ...
[11:12:22] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: okay, I only saw the summary line from the irc bot
[11:13:51] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Yeah ... it kinda sucks. You never see it until you actually click on the commit :/

[11:38:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you still around?
[13:04:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[13:04:17] <arschmitz> looked at your PR
[13:04:30] <arschmitz> had 2 minor things you might want to change
[13:04:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks! I'll go refresh the page now :)
[13:04:41] <arschmitz> i didnt actually comment lol
[13:04:51] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK :)
[13:04:56] <arschmitz> i probably should though just so its down
[13:05:24] <arschmitz> but basicly in set options jorn suggested previously we not use o for options to actually write out the arument as options
[13:05:28] <arschmitz> for clarity 
[13:05:46] <arschmitz> which makes sense it gets eaten by gzip / minification anyway
[13:06:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Riiiight ... should've remembered that when I switched away from one-letter variable names ...
[13:07:02] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'll make that change.
[13:07:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the other one was for the resize time out 
[13:07:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ...
[13:07:14] <arschmitz> might want to look at http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-_delay
[13:07:34] <arschmitz> im switching to it for the keyup timeout in the textarea autoheight extension
[13:07:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aaaah, but this is not a regular timeout.
[13:08:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait ... it's a drop-in replacement for setTimeout.
[13:08:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... right?
[13:08:24] <arschmitz> ok
[13:08:33] <arschmitz> yeah pretty much
[13:08:40] <arschmitz> but it maintins the this content
[13:08:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, then I suppose I can switch.
[13:08:42] <arschmitz> context
[13:08:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: RIght.
[13:08:47] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[13:08:52] <_|Nix|_> I'll switch to that.
[13:10:24] <arschmitz> other then that it looks good
[13:10:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright ... sounds like a quick fix ...
[13:11:03] <arschmitz> should be i "think" lol
[13:12:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh while im thinking about it we are trying to keep a list of what people already have for devices and i dont have on it what you have
[13:13:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Samsung Galaxy SII/Android 2.3.5, iPod/iOS 6.0.1, and Nokia Lumia 800 (I think)/WP7.5 (I think).
[13:13:54] <arschmitz> ok awesome
[13:13:56] <arschmitz> thanks
[13:15:05] <arschmitz> so you could use some newer androids i would say?
[13:18:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess ...
[13:18:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... I use clearTimeout ... does _delay have an equivalent?
[13:19:03] <arschmitz> it returns the timout id
[13:19:11] <arschmitz> so cleartimeout
[13:19:15] <arschmitz>  :)
[13:19:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just read that ... OK ... I guess I can use it then.
[13:20:16] <arschmitz> those ui guys they think of everything lol
[13:20:44] <arschmitz> should have named it _setTimout lol then it would be just like _on vs on
[13:22:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ... this._ignoreResizeTo = setTimeout( function() { self._ignoreResizeTo = 0; }, 1000 );
[13:22:40] <arschmitz> ??
[13:23:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Basically, it sets _ignoreResizeTo and unsets it when the timeout fires. If, during that time, I get resize events, the fact that this._ignoreResizeTo is not 0 influences the behaviour of the resize handler.
[13:24:26] <arschmitz> right i just was not sure if you were saying there was a problem or what?
[13:24:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's just groanworthy that I now have to create a widget-level function that consists of one line.
[13:24:39] <arschmitz> oh yeah
[13:25:23] <_|Nix|_> But hey! All in the name of getting-rid-of-self.
[13:25:39] <arschmitz> yup self can cause issues as a name apparently too
[13:25:52] <arschmitz> because self has meaning in certain contexts
[13:27:16] <_|Nix|_> Argh! The hoops I had to jump through to get smooth popup behaviour upon orientationchange and resize ... d000d ...
[13:28:06] <_|Nix|_> It's like "set this variable to true for a second." :/
[13:28:19] <_|Nix|_> *facepalm*
[13:28:35] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:29:07] <arschmitz> man iv been starting to try and remove the mobile namespace and switch to ui
[13:29:17] <arschmitz> such a big change
[13:29:25] <arschmitz> not for the actual js change
[13:29:31] <arschmitz> but in the docs!
[13:29:33] <_|Nix|_> Well, it'll reduce the filezie ...
[13:29:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can sed help?
[13:29:47] <arschmitz> no that was my first try
[13:29:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm  ... OK ...
[13:30:06] <arschmitz> but there are many places in docs / api docs where we are refering to the project name not the namespace
[13:30:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess it's an AI-complete search-and-replace.
[13:30:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But what about s/\.mobile\./.ui./g?
[13:30:47] <arschmitz> so for demos / api docs its going to have to be basicly a manual process
[13:31:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That should take care of programmatic references ...
[13:31:08] <_|Nix|_> /should/ :)
[13:31:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nope
[13:31:27] <arschmitz> "mobile.popup"
[13:31:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... *nod* ... 
[13:31:42] <arschmitz> or data refrences mobilePopup
[13:31:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... it's true ...
[13:32:00] <arschmitz> or events mobileinit
[13:32:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait ... we're not renaming mobileinit, are we?
[13:32:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's mobile-specific, isn't it?
[13:32:37] <arschmitz> i dont know 
[13:32:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I would think so ...
[13:33:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We have a ton of support stuff for which mobileinit is the signal that the initial values have all been established, but those values have not yet influenced the init process, so /now/ is the time to change the values manually, if desired.
[13:34:44] <arschmitz> right
[13:34:55] <arschmitz> if we reneamed it would just mean ui init
[13:35:07] <arschmitz> meaning the ui has been initalized
[13:35:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I wouldn't read it that way, especially with the semantics we have established for it. Still, nobody in the desktop world may be interested.
[13:36:47] <arschmitz> yeah i dunno about the mobile init event honestly that did not come up in the conversation about switching namespaces
[13:36:55] <arschmitz> its something we will have to figure out
[13:38:55] <arschmitz> crazy we dont even document mobileinit on the api site
[13:39:38] <arschmitz> mobile init is our only mobile event at least
