[15:02:55] <CBenni> Does anyone here have the slightest idea why http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9344 happens?
[15:03:27] <CBenni> Its a very old ticket and ive run across that problem myself just now, but I really have no clue where the differences lie
[15:03:56] <CBenni> id assume it has to do with the detection of locations of elements on the page, but where would one read up on that
[15:06:06] <CBenni> Its even worse for cases in which li elements have display: inline-block and are displayed in multiple rows and columns
[16:48:02] <CBenni> arschmitz, I think I found a solution, see https://github.com/CBenni/jquery-ui/blob/sortable-flex/ui/widgets/sortable.js
[16:48:16] <CBenni> Its a one-line change, just added _isFloating detection
[16:48:43] <CBenni> Is that PR worthy? I have no idea...

[17:44:52] <CBenni> im giving up on this, 3 hours is too much time wasted on a one-line-change.
