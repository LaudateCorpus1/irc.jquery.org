[04:50:51] <scott_gonzalez> gelegrodan: There's a lot more that needs to be updated than that line.
[04:51:11] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't even mention to the new repo or the new deployment process.
[04:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> The node script mentioned isn't used anymore.
[04:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get Richard to update the whole thing.
[10:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Can you update the getPostPaths API call to include a specific custom field?
[10:20:14] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: easily
[10:20:48] <scott_gonzalez> :-) The field I want will be named gwcs.
[10:22:48] <scott_gonzalez> The new return format can be [ postPath => [ "id" => id, "checksum" => gwcs ] ]
[10:34:43] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: okay, let me look
[12:25:22] <gnarf> nacin: I'm going to be setting up the nginx frontend proxies today I think - do you have that info, or should I just start doing this by hand?
[12:30:16] <nacin> gnarf: I keep looking around but I really don't have a whole lot. here's one: https://gist.github.com/e567c81060178663b238
[12:30:42] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I updated getPostPaths
[12:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Thanks.
[12:38:42] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Just FYI in case you look later and wonder why it's gone... I reverted your commit so that anyone working on deployments won't run into problems.
[12:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> I've got the changes locally so I can adjust grunt-wordpress to work with the new format.
[12:39:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'll recommit once grunt-wordpress is updated.
[12:39:13] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: ah, sorry about that. should have branched.
[12:39:53] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[13:53:12] <gelegrodan> scott_gonzalez: well i was just looking for sth to help with, and noticed that, was about to start coding
[13:53:26] <gelegrodan> when i saw that someone already madeit
