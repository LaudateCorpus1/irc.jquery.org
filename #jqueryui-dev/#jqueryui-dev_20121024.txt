[06:07:44] <tj_vantoll> So if a bug is no longer a bug because a browser fixed an issue… should the ticket be closed as "fixed"?  I just closed #5017 as fixed and was debating whether that was appropriate.

[07:44:43] <mikesherov> what do you mean?
[07:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Moving the legend to the left. Looks like it's already done though.
[07:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> When I checked before it hadn't been moved. Might've just been cached locally.
[07:45:52] <gnarf> yeah, did it at the same time
[07:45:59] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez:: haha, yeah, we did that yesterday
[07:46:05] <mikesherov> I was OCD on it too
[07:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> When I checked this morning, it was on the left for core, but right for UI, but the .js file was probably just cached.
[07:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> The funny thing is in order to get my dashboard to refresh the .js file, I had to open Safari and go to the ticketgraph :-P

[12:08:43] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez, gnarf, nacin, or others that might know: does blog.jquery.com have a problem with accepting non-ASCII chars? I can put them in the editor but they're turned into ? in preview
[12:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You mean what we're doing for the UI demos?
[12:09:56] <agcolom> yes
[12:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Well, the Uglify post has € in it.
[12:11:41] <agcolom> I'm just thinking that if there is already a system in place that works, we might as well reuse it. If it cannot be reused then no problem...
[12:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Maybe just put a class on the ones that should start collapsed and then write some JS in web-base-template?
[12:12:44] <jzaefferer> kborchers kswedberg: how's that for quick navigation? http://bassistance.de/i/af4818.png new Overview and Example links
[12:13:03] <DaveMethvin> I can confirm that € survives, but 在IE8中方法.HTML的BUG (chinese) does not
[12:13:05] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: This is the code that runs on jqueryui.com: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/themes/jquery/js/scripts.js#L180
[12:13:12] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHAHA
[12:13:25] <agcolom> oh no, we still want to show all of them, but we want users to be able to view the full code of the example

[12:14:24] <agcolom> ah, you mean the code source is collapsed!
[12:14:27] <agcolom> ?
[12:14:33] <agcolom> so then yes!
[12:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what I meant.
[12:15:22] <agcolom> ok, I'll have a look... thx.
[12:15:27] <jzaefferer> agcolom: since you're also work on API docs, any comment on this? http://bassistance.de/i/af4818.png
[12:15:38] <jzaefferer> addressing https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/pull/9
[12:16:23] <agcolom> jzaefferer: nice!
[12:17:17] <agcolom> jzaefferer: yes I think that works!
[12:17:24] <jzaefferer> alright, I'll land it then; may need some CSS porting to make this available outside of api.jqueryui.com though
[12:17:43] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: I like it! I'd expect Overview to come before Examples, though.
[12:18:26] <agcolom> yes I agree with kswedberg too...
[12:19:23] <agcolom> just thinking... if we lose the underline of those 2 links, would it still be obvious that they are links?
[12:19:24] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: remember that problem we had with escaped <desc> on stage.api.jquery.com?
[12:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: yeah
[12:20:35] <agcolom> just a thought... as they are in that heading box, I'm thinking it may look nicer without the underline...
[12:21:18] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: well, I now remember why we needed to have them wrapped in CDATA: http://cl.ly/image/2X2o1C0T2y1G
[12:22:08] <kswedberg> The xmlrpc will strip all child nodes in the excerpt.
[12:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> d'oh
[12:22:21] <scott_gonzalez> We can fix that in WordPress.
[12:22:28] <kswedberg> really?
[12:22:45] <agcolom> but then no underline when all other links are underlined may confuse the users.... so not sure...
[12:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, it's WordPress.
[12:22:55] <kswedberg> I thought the problem was in the transport
[12:22:55] <scott_gonzalez> If you want it to do something, there's probably 50 hooks for it.
[12:23:30] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's not going to be a problem in the XML-RPC transport itself, right?
[12:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be on the client or server code.
[12:24:04] <scott_gonzalez> I can verify that.
[12:24:11] <kswedberg> yeah, I guess so. I'll leave it to you to figure that one out. :p
[12:24:32] <scott_gonzalez> heh, so I don't remember if we landed this or not.
[12:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> If we didn't, can you comment on the ticket.
[12:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> If we did, can you file a new ticket?
[12:25:06] <kswedberg> landed what?
[12:25:30] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't we need to change something somewhere besides just not using CDATA?
[12:25:41] <scott_gonzalez> Like calling <xsl:apply-templates> on something?
[12:26:21] <kswedberg> oh yeah. xml2entries-base.xsl change .text() to .html() or something like that.

[12:33:12] <scott_gonzalez> I think after I review all this dialog code, jzaefferer will let me wander away from UI stuff :-)

[13:14:31] <jzaefferer> agcolom: sure
[13:14:51] <petersendidit> gnarf: resolve as: ???
[13:15:02] <agcolom> do I need to upgrade grunt in api.jquerymobile.com?
[13:15:10] <gnarf> petersendidit: um - "invalid" i suppose (wrong tracker)
[13:15:15] <jzaefferer> petersendidit as "notabug"
[13:15:19] <gnarf> notabug
[13:15:20] <gnarf> thats better
[13:15:32] <petersendidit> ok that works
[13:15:50] <agcolom> (grunt-jquery-content": "0.5.8")
[13:16:02] <jzaefferer> agcolom: should be using grunt 0.3.17
[13:16:07] <jzaefferer> ah, grunt-jquery-content 0.5.8, yes
[13:16:56] <agcolom> jzaefferer: ok, thanks, will do that now.
[13:18:41] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] jzaefferer pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/1mnDhw
[13:18:41] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Adding examples of content icons in accordion. Fixes #27 - Marcus Rabil
[13:18:41] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Adding validation for opacity inputs. Fixes #31 - Marcus Rabil
[13:27:36] <doesallmagic> Project download.jqueryui.com build #19: STILL FAILING in 21 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/download.jqueryui.com/19/
[13:27:36] <doesallmagic> * joern.zaefferer: Adding examples of content icons in accordion. Fixes #27
[13:27:37] <doesallmagic> * joern.zaefferer: Adding validation for opacity inputs. Fixes #31
[13:35:58] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer force-pushed dialog from 3ad3fa1 to 69113e4: http://git.io/kawbpA
[13:35:58] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/dialog] Dialog: Awesome new stacking and overlay implementation. Fixes the following tickets: - Nate Eagle
[13:35:58] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/dialog] Dialog: Prevent dialog form losing focus (or move it back in IE <= 8). - Jörn Zaefferer
[13:35:58] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/dialog] Dialog: Save the active element that opened the dialog and restore focus to that. - Jörn Zaefferer
[13:53:04] <jzaefferer> gnarf: this is still failing in IE9: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4421 - only when using a wrapper-based effect - supposedly the fix for http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7595 was handling that, but doesn't work for IE9 here
[13:53:41] <gnarf> jzaefferer: is focus set before show or during show or when?
[13:54:11] <jzaefferer> I think after starting the animation
[13:54:32] <jzaefferer> using _show though, so can't set focus before that
[13:54:59] <gnarf> yeah
[13:55:05] <gnarf> lemme look at the commit that fixed it
[13:55:57] <gnarf> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/8108ec82dbc1c203893db18aac827b93d48cfc07

[13:58:18] <jzaefferer> so this fails because we set focus after the animation starts?
[13:58:29] <gnarf> i don't think so
[13:58:39] <gnarf> the removeWrapper should carry whatever is focused
[13:58:53] <gnarf> active should be that input
[13:59:13] <jzaefferer> right
[13:59:20] <gnarf> not sure why this isn't working
[13:59:25] <gnarf> but it definitely isn't working

[14:03:48] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer force-pushed dialog from d31c6c7 to d07074d: http://git.io/kawbpA

[14:04:00] <scott_gonzalez> There we go...
[14:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> BOOM!
[14:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> umm....where's jquicommit?
[14:05:31] <jzaefferer> I pushed the red button
[14:05:43] <agcolom> ajpiano: hello! Is there someone writing a public summary/outcome of the jQuery Dev Summit?
[14:05:51] <jzaefferer> probably doesn't care about fast-forwards
[14:05:52] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/581340c703d58b0b5f25
[14:05:54] <gnarf> @scott_gonzalez
[14:06:17] <ajpiano> hey agcolom
[14:06:21] <agcolom> hey :-)
[14:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I wanted jquicommit to announce the merge to master.
[14:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> But I guess it doesn't care about fast-forwards like jzaefferer said
[14:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the BOOM happened in everyone's inbox anyway :-P
[14:06:51] <ajpiano> it's been in my docket but there has been a lot in the queue :)
[14:06:56] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph :-)
[14:07:27] <agcolom> ajpiano: oh, ok... no rush... I was just checking that something was going to be done...
[14:08:01] <ajpiano> yeah, i need to get to it soon or the iron will cease to be hot
[14:10:15] <agcolom> yes, I know exactly how that feels... I'm glad it's on your todo list ;)
[14:10:59] <agcolom> definitely bedtime for me! goodnight everyone... Early start tomorrow! (6.30am :-( )
[14:12:50] <ajpiano> :)
[14:12:53] <ajpiano> gnite!!
[14:24:45] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I added a line item to the infra meeting doc; I probably won't be able to attend that
[14:25:10] <jzaefferer> gnarf: might not be the right place, but it would be good to get some discussion on that
