[05:06:38] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so, what's a cantfix?
[05:07:30] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/7415-sortable-revert
[05:07:44] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7415
[05:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa, I didn't even notice that the ticket had an inline patch last night.
[05:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> I just saw TJ's comment in an email.
[05:09:50] <scott_gonzalez> If you look at http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/fKTST/ you'll see the issue with the animation.
[05:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> I assume the problem is that style.left isn't set at the beginning and it's not being interpreted correctly in .animate().
[05:27:49] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: So is download builder still good to go?
[05:27:55] <scott_gonzalez> The failure is only in master, right?
[05:31:12] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[05:31:32] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so that fix should land.
[05:31:38] <mikesherov> I'm not actually sure this is a bug in core
[05:31:48] <mikesherov> So much caching of values
[05:32:17] <mikesherov> I'm not sure what cur.left is and what this.offset.parent.left is
[05:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what those are either.
[05:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> But the end value is correct.
[05:32:36] <scott_gonzalez> And that's all that matters.
[05:32:56] <mikesherov> right, it's definitely the start value
[05:33:04] <mikesherov> oh, so it must be in core
[05:33:08] <scott_gonzalez> right :-)
[05:33:23] <mikesherov> it's early
[05:33:31] <scott_gonzalez> It is indeed.
[05:33:32] <mikesherov> my brain hasn't fully booted up yet
[05:34:49] <mikesherov> hmmm, want me to investigate more
[05:34:51] <mikesherov> ?
[05:35:18] <mikesherov> my gut is that it's something to do with auto->px conversion
[05:35:36] <mikesherov> actually, no
[05:35:50] <mikesherov> another guess I would have is switching from absolute to relative
[05:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'd be good to investigate.
[05:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> Either way, we'll need to land the fix in UI.
[05:39:39] <scott_gonzalez> Just need to write a test.
[05:41:08] <mikesherov> OK, so it is left:"auto"
[05:41:22] <mikesherov> which gets converted to 0
[05:42:53] <mikesherov> nothing we can do except wait for this to land in Webkit: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29084
[05:42:57] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[05:44:26] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:49:43] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: thanks for actually working on interactions! glad to see we're vested in fixing options even though we're removing them in a future version
[05:50:16] <mikesherov> I was nervous that we would just wait for Dave and Nate to finish the API redesign
[05:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> I blame you and TJ.
[05:50:39] <mikesherov> HAHA
[05:50:53] <mikesherov> what, making it a bit easier to see the actual bugs?
[05:51:54] <scott_gonzalez> That, and getting the count low enough that fixing interactions actually seems helpful :-P
[05:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> We're under 350 now!

[08:18:24] <rxaviers_> checking at logs
[08:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Don't worry about checking the logs. I was just wondering if download builder is good for the release.
[08:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> Since we'll be tagging.
[08:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> And there was a deploy failure this morning.
[08:20:03] <rxaviers> today morning I've deployed it to check it live
[08:20:28] <rxaviers> I dont know why the deploy failed. I've re-ran the same commands and it worked.
[08:20:38] <rxaviers> (perhaps due to grunt version change)
[08:20:52] <rxaviers> But, I'm seeing one new error.

[10:03:04] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, About the 1M downloads blog post, should we hold on that?
[10:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yeah, we should wait until after 1.10.2
[10:03:50] <rxaviers> sure, makes sense
[10:04:01] <scott_gonzalez> And we should update it to 1.5M :-P
[10:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, something that came up this morning which I forgot to put on the agenda.
[10:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> We should do a 1.9.3 release for core compatibility issues.
[10:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Does download builder handle >2 versions?
[10:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure I've told you in the past that we'll never have more than 2.
[10:06:52] <rxaviers> :)
[10:06:56] <rxaviers> but, yeap it does
[10:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, then depending on when 1.9.3 comes out, we might want to host 3 versions for a bit.
[10:07:30] <rxaviers> ok
[10:07:53] <jzaefferer> That's the fun thing with software.
[10:08:15] <scott_gonzalez> The constant change in requirements?
[10:08:17] <jzaefferer> You can do 1 or 2. Where two equals infinity...
[10:08:19] <rxaviers> we'll may need to change the layout in config. But, pretty doable.
[10:08:25] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah, 0, 1, or many.
[10:08:49] <jzaefferer> Yeah, many describes it better
[10:10:15] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: so, about that bug
[10:10:35] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5154163
[10:10:46] <rxaviers> 2nd line is the actual stacktrace
[10:11:28] <rxaviers> apparently we have undefined on fields.version https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/download.js#L91
[10:12:22] <rxaviers> Or (a) client is not submitting it for some reason, or (b) it's getting lost/deleted on server.
[10:13:00] <jzaefferer> formatted a bit: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/5154172
[10:13:29] <rxaviers> The first line is me debugging fields
[10:13:33] <rxaviers> better
[10:14:28] <rxaviers> (actually _.omit(fields, "theme"), because theme value is huge and we log line gets clipped)
[10:14:39] <rxaviers> the* log line
[10:18:16] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the stacktrace lines don't match sourcecode in master
[10:18:32] <jzaefferer> the one in lib/builder.js is just one line off
[10:18:54] <rxaviers> perhaps because I added a debug line
[10:19:11] <jzaefferer> where did you add that?
[10:19:28] <jzaefferer> where can I see the live source?
[10:19:30] <rxaviers> live
[10:19:38] <jzaefferer> you edited on the server?
[10:19:40] <rxaviers> jq02.jquery.com
[10:19:52] <rxaviers> on stage or local I dont get that error
[10:19:54] <rxaviers> :(
[10:19:55] <jzaefferer> please say you didn't edit on the server :/
[10:20:20] <rxaviers> ops I did.
[10:20:25] <jzaefferer> oh well
[10:20:49] <rxaviers> some minutes ago, I just reset --hard HEAD, so you'll see same code as in master
[10:21:20] <jzaefferer> line 87 in server.js still doesn't match anything
[10:21:26] <jzaefferer> agh
[10:21:38] <jzaefferer> do you have a stacktrace that refers to code that I can look at?
[10:21:53] <jzaefferer> debugging ghosts is stupid
[10:22:21] <rxaviers> well, it's the line I pointed you on github above.
[10:22:34] <rxaviers> let me vim syslog and get you the initial stacktrace
[10:22:41] <jzaefferer> that's download.js, not server.js
[10:23:00] <rxaviers> server calls that download method
[10:23:05] <rxaviers> download.create
[10:23:09] <rxaviers> just a sec

[11:38:31] <ryanneufeld> even though neither of them have passed since 2012
[11:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> They test UI agaisnt old core.
[11:39:19] <jzaefferer> They are supposed to be useful. Since we ignore the results, they aren't really

[13:24:56] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, bugs fixed.. (a) The one about missing version really seemed to be a crawler. The buggy request comes from the same IP. And like jzaefferer said, we could simply return an error to the request, if it's not a crawler someone may file a bug. (b) The themeroller one about picking a texture was a regression to my handlebars rewrite. It missed passing one variable, fixed.
