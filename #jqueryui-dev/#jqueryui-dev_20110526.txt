[06:28:52] <rworth> oh snap is right
[06:41:24] <ruprict> So, anyone using vim for jquery-ui dev?  The tab/space thing is driving me to drink.
[06:41:46] <ruprict> Any suggested .vimrc settings?
[06:42:55] <rworth> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1987821/what-should-go-in-my-vimrc-file-tab-related-question ?
[06:44:30] <ruprict> Thanks….seems to be a bit different than the rails/vim crowd uses.
[08:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> ruprict: the radio demo still doesn't show the focus state
[08:09:27] <scott_gonzalez> checkbox demo is working now though
[08:09:37] <ruprict> Will take a look....
[08:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[08:10:46] <ruprict> Actually, I thought that the css class was applied, but it doesn't change the visibility of toggle buttons.
[08:11:10] <ruprict> Meaning, if you hover over the selected button on that control, it does not visibly change.
[08:11:44] <ruprict> The question is, do we want to change the .ui-state-focus class to show some visible change for the toggle buttons?
[08:13:40] <ruprict> Does that make sense?
[08:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> I do get a visual difference when hovering the radio button
[08:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> at least when it's not active
[08:16:09] <ruprict> Right, exactly.
[08:17:10] <ruprict> But, the core radio button set highlights the active radio button on focus.
[08:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> oh, I see
[08:17:19] <ruprict> If we want to mimic that....
[08:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> ok, your patch is fine then
[08:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> we probably do want to style the focused active item differently, but that's a completely separate issue
[08:18:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'll merge your branch right now
[08:18:13] <ruprict> If that gets log…it could be my next issue :)
[08:18:51] <ruprict> sorry logged
[08:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> unfortunately, I think that needs to go through the design team and would need changes to ThemeRoller
[08:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> since we'd need to let people configure what the active focused element looks like
[08:20:44] <ruprict> No worries.  I'll hunt down another more my pay grade…..
[08:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> heh

[08:30:36] <scott_gonzalez> heh, finally landed, took me long enough...
[08:33:24] <ruprict> Well, had to deal with my incompetence.  Thanks for your patience, Scott.
[08:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> no problem, thanks for the patch
[09:11:51] <manattweb> need help with a sortable question - is this channel different than the jquery one?
[09:12:01] <manattweb> been over there and don't want to duplicate things
[09:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> this is for development of sortable
[09:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> so if you have a question about how it's implemented, this is the right place
[09:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> if it's a question of how to use it, then that's #jquery
[09:12:43] <rworth> manattweb: I can help you in #jquery if your question is about use
[09:13:54] <manattweb> It's a problem with sortables - need an item that is dragged to top sortable to be last in list, not next to last as it is doing

[11:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> thanks ruprict1, a few others tested in #jquery-dev too and they couldn't reproduce
[11:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just leave it closed

[16:25:32] <jamesarosen> jzaefferer: I also added a slideEasing option for those who want something nicer. I considered making the transitions CSS3, but couldn't think of a good way to fail over to jQuery events
