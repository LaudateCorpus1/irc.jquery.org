[07:40:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Ping!
[07:43:01] <arschmitz> gseguin: Ping
[08:55:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pong
[08:57:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you still here?
[08:57:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[08:58:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://stage.jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[08:59:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool
[09:00:02] <arschmitz> so download builder is all set now
[09:00:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[09:02:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you can look at those open demos tickets, I'll try to finish TR and new web site stuff this week
[09:02:17] <arschmitz> yup no problem
[09:03:28] <arschmitz> ill fix that comma too :)
[09:03:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome :)
[09:05:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: feeling a bit better already?
[09:05:41] <arschmitz> a little enough to get some work done at least
[09:48:01] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'm here but not for long
[09:48:05] <gseguin> what's up?
[09:48:20] <arschmitz> just wanted to let you know the download builder is all ported over to new site
[09:48:26] <arschmitz> http://stage.jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[09:48:35] <gseguin> awesome!
[09:48:45] <gseguin> any change as to how to deploy?
[09:48:49] <arschmitz> and no longer used the jquery-mobile-builder repo
[09:49:01] <gseguin> it's using the new DB ?
[09:49:07] <arschmitz> gseguin: no
[09:49:14] <gseguin> jquerymobile.com ?
[09:49:26] <arschmitz> gseguin: part of it is there and part is in jquery-wp-content
[09:49:35] <gseguin> okidoc
[09:49:38] <arschmitz> the html file is in jquerymobile.com repo
[09:49:43] <gseguin> I'll update my workspace
[09:49:47] <arschmitz> and the js and css are in jquery-wp-content
[09:49:56] <gseguin> kewl!
[09:50:02] <arschmitz> to update you just update the html in jquerymobile.com
[09:50:10] <arschmitz> basicly same as before
[09:50:15] <gseguin> yup
[09:50:23] <gseguin> thanks for the heads up
[09:50:32] <arschmitz> gseguin: i also hardcoded the host url
[09:50:39] <gseguin> ok
[09:50:44] <arschmitz> gseguin: so now it works local and on staging assuming you have internet access
[09:50:56] <gseguin> good idea
[09:51:31] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah just wanted to give you a heads up that that repo is basicly dead and how its setup now
[09:51:48] <gseguin> you know I was thinking about the require-CSS stuff, if we export a bower package we can express dependcy on require-CSS
[09:52:04] <gseguin> that would solve the issue for a lot of people wouldn't it?
[09:52:06] <arschmitz> hmmm now i wonder where i should direct issues
[09:52:13] <arschmitz> probably jquerymobile.com repo
[09:52:21] <gseguin> yeah that would make sense
[09:52:33] <gseguin> let's have DownloadBuilder tag
[09:52:38] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:53:53] <gseguin> I need to work on the bower package
[09:54:00] <arschmitz> gseguin: we dont want a dependency on it though
[09:54:19] <gseguin> we already have a dependency on RequireJS
[09:54:22] <arschmitz> because then if people want to use just amd in the traditional way they still have to modify it 
[09:54:37] <gseguin> yeah I understand that
[09:54:38] <arschmitz> right and thats fine but we dont want to enforce css via amd
[09:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: There's only an internal dependency on RequireJS, not an external dependency.
[09:55:25] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: true
[09:56:03] <gseguin> and don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing here, but our current solution is far from ideal
[09:56:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: do you think the jquerymobile.com repo is the right place for DB issues for mobile for now since there is no repo specifically for it anymore? 
[09:56:57] <gseguin> could we have like a build option to opt-out of the css! in amd ?
[09:57:22] <gseguin> or some kind of switch
[09:57:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: we have always had it so people can clone and use files as is
[09:57:40] <arschmitz> we want to maintain that
[09:57:58] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: yup
[09:58:16] <arschmitz> and also allow people to use amd on those files with out having to do anything weird or modifying files
[09:59:05] <gseguin> could we transform these comments into a commented out define using css! ?
[09:59:17] <gseguin> gotta run, I'll pick up later
[09:59:18] <gseguin> sorry
[10:00:20] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: We've been over this several times already. We've decided, as a group, that we're not going to do this. Can we please stop talking about it over and over?

[13:50:28] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz anyone around? 
[13:50:33] <arschmitz> im here
[13:50:42] <agcolom> Hi Alex :-)
[13:50:55] <agcolom> I'm wondering if I've come across a bug...
[13:51:28] <agcolom> if you take a select, and have the value as #one and #two for the two options...
[13:52:03] <agcolom> when the selected value changes, navigate to the value of the selected select
[13:52:31] <agcolom> that works fine with a native select but not if I add data-native-menu="false"
[13:52:54] <agcolom> Is that something you're aware of?
[13:53:04] <agcolom> I can do a quick jsbin
[13:55:38] <arschmitz> yeah a jsbin would help im not completely following
[14:00:09] <agcolom> arschmitz: here it is..
[14:00:10] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/OSakebU/2
[14:03:16] <arschmitz> agcolom: looking
[14:03:34] <agcolom> thx :-) I've kept everything as simple as possible...
[14:05:31] <agcolom> is it because the "popup" to show the selection is on the "main" page and when you make a selection that comes back into view to disappear that we're back onto that page?
[14:05:55] <agcolom> (instead of staying on page 1 or page 2)?
[14:06:14] <arschmitz> agcolom: ok figured it out
[14:06:19] <agcolom> yes?
[14:06:22] <arschmitz> your using navigate
[14:06:27] <arschmitz> thats not what navigate is for
[14:06:34] <agcolom> oh... 
[14:06:38] <arschmitz> you should be using changePage
[14:06:53] <arschmitz> also simplified it some more
[14:06:58] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/OSakebU/3/edit
[14:07:06] <agcolom> ok!
[14:07:44] <arschmitz> and actually changePage is deprecated in 1.4
[14:08:22] <agcolom> right, so what should I use after 1.4?
[14:08:55] <arschmitz> and you should now use the change method on pageContainer
[14:09:19] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/OSakebU/3/edit
[14:09:30] <arschmitz> update to use change method
[14:09:50] <agcolom> you're not freezing the jsbin
[14:10:48] <arschmitz> yeah you can just refresh
[14:11:03] <agcolom> thx :-)
[14:11:57] <arschmitz> agcolom: no problem
[14:13:36] <agcolom> arschmitz: have found it in the doc! :-) Thx again :-)
[15:30:54] <gseguin> arschmitz: still there?
[15:31:29] <gseguin> js/widgets/jquery.ui.tabs is not amdified
[15:32:34] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: we do have a dependency on requirejs at runtime since a few ui components are getting shimed
[15:32:54] <gseguin> when using the code from the repo that is
[15:40:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! Guess what: The WD HDD finally kicked it :(
[15:42:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Anyway ... 
[15:50:03] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: what's left for 1.4 final?
[15:53:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Not sure ... I've been on vacation ... I got back last night.
[15:53:19] <gseguin> oh ok
[15:53:25] <gseguin> welcome back!
[15:53:30] <gseguin> good vacation?
[15:53:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: rxaviers has moved the entire UI build process into the download builder - rather than the other way around, the way we were discussing.
[15:54:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Perhaps that's not a bad idea. CDN build === custom build with all checkboxes checked.
[15:54:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah ... vacation was decent. Not like sunshine, sand, and ocean. I attended my sister's wedding.
[15:54:54] <gseguin> yeah that makes sense
[15:54:56] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It was quite packed.
[15:56:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Anyway ... I think I'll dive back in in approximately 7-8 hours. That's Wednesday morning for me.
[15:56:42] <gseguin> after catching up on all that email ;)
[15:56:51] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah :)
[15:56:59] <gseguin> I just tried to use 1.4.0-rc.1 imported via bower in a project (so the AMD micro-module version) and it's breaking left and right
[15:57:15] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll try to catch some Zzzzs in the meantime, but my daughter's rhythm is to have a nap from 21:00 to 23:00 ... and then up 'till, like, 3:00 :/
[15:57:28] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Great :/
[15:57:30] <gseguin> oh oops
[15:57:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah ... need to work on that (bower /and/ rhythm) :)
[15:58:20] <gseguin> I'm going to start working on the bower thing immediatly after the release automation
[15:58:33] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Awesome!
[16:30:27] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: That's a temporary issue.
