[07:23:59] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/BX2viA
[07:23:59] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Added links to docs for all widgets and interactions. - Scott González
[07:41:05] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Are we supposed to do any processing on the single XML file?
[07:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> Like replacing notes.
[07:42:09] <kswedberg> hmm. good question. I'll take a look at what we do currently. I'm guessing that we will have to do the note replacement thing.
[07:43:53] <kswedberg> kind of slammed at work. will be a bit before I can look.
[07:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok, thanks
[08:16:24] <kswedberg> kborchers: yt?
[08:17:17] <kborchers> kswedberg: in a meeting, i'll ping when i'm done
[08:17:24] <kswedberg> kthx
[09:10:34] <kborchers> kswedberg: sup?
[09:11:04] <kswedberg> kborchers: I sent you a Doodle email. click the link. it'll take you 20 seconds
[09:11:28] <kswedberg> gnarf: same with you ↑
[09:12:38] <kborchers> kswedberg: done
[09:12:44] <kswedberg> thank you sir.
[09:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> OMG why is our site so shitty?
[09:35:10] <scott_gonzalez> How long do you think this page has looked like total crap? http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
[09:37:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ping
[10:12:25] <agcolom> kborchers: Thank you so much!!!! It's beautiful!!!!
[10:12:35] <kborchers> :)
[10:13:11] <agcolom> kborchers: scott_gonzalez : I just noted though that the description of the widget comes last... after after options, methods and events...
[10:13:48] <kborchers> agcolom: you should consider a complimentary color for headers and or links … i went with a red for qunitjs.com and i think it helps with all of that green. you won't want red because it will look too much like qunit but i think it needs something
[10:13:56] <agcolom> is that deliberate?
[10:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: yes
[10:14:19] <agcolom> sure, Thanks I'll have a look...
[10:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, at least it's what the designers delivered.
[10:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> I put the QuickNav into the main box so that the description could be higher, but kborchers moved it out to match the delivered comp.
[10:15:00] <agcolom> I'm going away for my father in law's funerals tomorrow.... but I'll be back on sunday evening, so I will probably do that next week.
[10:15:31] <agcolom> I like the box that you have on ui for methods, options and events. Makes it more readable
[10:16:13] <kborchers> agcolom: just some styles that need to be copied over
[10:17:12] <agcolom> sure. I like the idea of using purple as a complementary color... or blue... I'll have to try things out....
[10:18:18] <agcolom> and did you see my message regarding .desc (about adding font-weight: normal) ?
[10:18:49] <agcolom> (just an idea... )
[10:19:00] <agcolom> kborchers: ^
[10:29:20] <kborchers> agcolom: i did, i haven't looked at that yet
[10:43:34] <gnarf> hey, here now
[10:46:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: pong
[10:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> For the new version of http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/ I'm just going to say that all of the functionality comes from the color plugin and link to the jquery-color repo.
[10:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> Seem like a good idea?
[10:48:17] <gnarf> I dunno, seems we might have an easier time showing it off inside the jqueryui site than on the github readme
[10:48:40] <scott_gonzalez> The demo will still be there.
[10:48:43] <gnarf> but i suppose it does make sense
[10:52:49] <gnarf> kswedberg: doodle doesn't seem to want to accept my submission
[10:53:02] <kswedberg> :(
[10:53:08] <gnarf> i picked the last 4 options tho
[10:53:21] <gnarf> aha, there it went
[10:53:28] <gnarf> third times the charm i guess
[10:53:45] <kswedberg> yay
[11:15:30] <kswedberg> gnarf: any way you could do 10 or 10:30 on Thurs? Totally forgot that Bradley has his big conservancy mtg at 11.
[11:15:43] <gnarf> ET?
[11:15:48] <gnarf> >maybe< ?
[11:16:02] <gnarf> I can try...
[11:16:02] <kswedberg> yes. ET.
[11:16:28] <gnarf> If I miss it tho, there shouldn't be any big surprises from me on hours
[11:16:34] <kswedberg> ok. If you had to choose between those two, which one would you choose?
[11:16:44] <gnarf> 10:30
[11:17:02] <kswedberg> ok. sounds good. I'll ask Bradley and get back to everyone.
[11:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you know if (mt) would have a breakdown of which pages are causing the most bandwidth usage for docs.jquery.com?
[11:20:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no, but I could probably figure that out based on the logs
[11:20:33] <scott_gonzalez> That might be useful.
[11:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> Find out if there are some high profile pages we can move to one of the new sites sooner rather than later.
[11:24:21] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] rxaviers force-pushed themeroller from cc5cc35 to 37fd2ed: http://git.io/6rnZvg
[11:24:21] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/themeroller] Create ThemeRoller front end (draft) - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[11:26:59] <gnarf> why does he keep force pushing?
[11:27:19] <gnarf> xavier_: ^^^?
[11:27:44] <gnarf> force push is generally bad idea, just curious why I keep seeing it on your themeroller push
[11:28:27] <xavier_> gnarf, to let people (say jzaefferer) see the going progress of the implementation.
[11:28:54] <gnarf> why force push tho, as oppsoed to regular push?
[11:29:08] <gnarf> are you rewriting history / ammending commits you've already pushed?
[11:29:14] <xavier_> yeap
[11:31:49] <gnarf> any particular reason you aren't just adding new commits? when you merge the branch you can squash it all into one anyway
[11:32:18] <kborchers> xavier_: i was wondering the same thing as gnarf. every time i see that force push i cringe
[11:33:11] <xavier_> kborchers, gnarf, yeap, I know force pushing it looks weird. This is an big commit and I'm in touch with jzaefferer to let him know the on going progress, so we can discuss.
[11:33:26] <xavier_> s/an/a
[11:34:54] <gnarf> well, as long as you two know what you're doin, and that force push scares the crap out of us, keep on keepin' on ;)
[11:35:08] <xavier_> :)
[11:36:53] <xavier_> jzaefferer, shall I avoid force pushing to upstream ^ and instead use my user-repo rxaviers? So, it avoids alerting/warning everyone here?
[11:42:22] <gnarf> btw
[11:42:39] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez kborchers jzaefferer - any plans for a jQuery UI 1.9 Widget Factory talk?
[11:43:10] <kborchers> gnarf: when
[11:43:15] <gnarf> xavier_: it's on a branch, so not so concerned
[11:43:43] <gnarf> kborchers: *shrug* for any of these upcoming events - I just feel like its more important to talk about that than the 1.8 effects changes
[11:43:45] <xavier_> gnarf, okay
[11:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: A talk for what event?
[11:44:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm just curious if you guys were thinking about doing a 1.9 "how to build a widget" talk at all
[11:44:37] <gnarf> for any of them
[11:44:54] <gnarf> if someone else had one, I'll work on an effects talk
[11:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> I don't plan on presenting at any confs for a while.
[11:45:14] <gnarf> k
[11:45:23] <scott_gonzalez> Super busy with 1.9 + sites + moving.
[11:45:25] <gnarf> then I'll work on a widget factory deck
[11:45:28] <kborchers> gnarf: i don't have a 1.9 widget factory talk planned, no
[11:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> :-)

[13:28:36] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: We've got a race condition in grunt-wordpress and I'm wondering if you have an idea for the best solution.
[13:28:47] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: fun
[13:28:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm tracking resources in a JSON file.
[13:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> So when you add or remove a resource, I update the file.
[13:29:27] <scott_gonzalez> But on the node side I'm processing resources in parallel.
[13:29:46] <scott_gonzalez> So there's a race condition between reading in the file, decoding it, updating the data, encoding it and writing the file.
[13:30:28] <scott_gonzalez> I can a) ignore the problem and process resources in serial b) use a file lock c) stop using a flat file.
[13:42:46] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: sorry, took me a moment to understand what your issue was.
[13:42:53] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: what's the purpose of the JSON file?
[13:44:10] <nacin> I would think that I'd prefer C over B over A.
[13:44:23] <nacin> but it depends on the purpose of the flat file.
[13:44:50] <nacin> also, to use a lock, each process would need to wait for the file to be writeable again, which introduces either a race or a lag.
[13:45:06] <nacin> serial is kind of lame as working with files can be slow.
[13:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's just a list of checksums for the files.
[13:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> So that we can detect if the file has changed.
[13:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> It's path -> md5
[19:17:28] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: the current full xml file does process notes and adds them as <note> nodes after merging with placeholders
