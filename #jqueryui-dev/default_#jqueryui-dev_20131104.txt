[03:04:11] <Serdar> hello
[03:04:45] <Serdar> I am looking for a popup or modal window which I can use for my web application.
[03:05:11] <Serdar> my problem at the moment is, that I want a popup/modal window which appears in front of al
[03:05:13] <Serdar> all
[03:05:31] <Serdar> is this possible with jqueryui?
[03:05:47] <Krikke> in jquery mobile there is dialog
[03:06:24] <Serdar> is there a non mobile-solution?
[03:06:34] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Hi. When are you going to discuss "DB+TR sharing between UI and Mobile"?
[03:06:43] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, uGoMobi ^
[03:08:04] <Serdar> window.open is only a blinking IE icon on my task menu
[03:08:24] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I can't tell you, we're currently discussing jQuery's ajax module
[03:08:36] <jzaefferer> I don't know when we're going to get to DB/TR
[03:09:04] <jzaefferer> Serdar: you can get support in #jquery
[03:09:25] <Serdar> jzaefferer, I thought this is a jqueryui stuff?!
[03:09:42] <Serdar> Dialog widgets
[03:10:40] <jzaefferer> Serdar: We're talking about their development here, you won't get an answer to your question
[03:10:49] <jzaefferer> #jquery is the way to go; also StackOverflow
[03:11:18] <Serdar> ah, sorry
[03:15:09] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I guess it's all planned for today then?
[03:16:47] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: dunno
[03:16:50] <rxaviers> ah ok

[08:14:12] <rxaviers> team, what do you think of using +String instead of parseInt(String, 10)?
[08:15:03] <rxaviers> It looks a lot nicer. But, I don't know the implications of browser support, interpreter optimizations, etc.
[08:15:26] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, arschmitz, tj_vantoll, mikesherov ^
[08:15:30] <rxaviers> uGoMobi ^
[08:21:21] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: I hadn't heard of the technique so I'm not sure of the implications.
[08:22:16] <tj_vantoll> I agree that it reads cleaner.
[08:22:36] <rxaviers> thks
[08:24:22] <rmcdaniel> _|Nix|_: did we decide on what needs to be done about pull request 6686?
[08:36:36] <agcolom> rxaviers: +String converts to a number, not to an integer.
[08:36:51] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: if the input is user input, always use parseInt/Float
[08:37:37] <agcolom> Also, look at the difference between +"10px" and parseInt( "10px", 10 )
[08:40:18] <rxaviers> agcolom, good point, +"1.5" becomes 1.5, not 1; and +"10px" becomes NaN, not 10.
[08:40:28] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, why?
[08:41:21] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: arschmitz thinks that it's OK to call this._setOptions({ fullscreen: this.options.fullscreen, position: this.options.position }) from fixedToolbar.js:_create()
[08:42:13] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: I guess that's OK.
[08:42:51] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: ... because then you still get chaining, but the chaining will be harmless, because you won't be passing non-fixed-toolbar-related options to the superclass.
[08:45:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: rmcdaniel: to be clear i was not saying this is what SHOULD be done in this case i was saying in general it is not wrong to call set options from create as long as you are only passing specific params you need to set
[08:48:12] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: probably for the same reason as agcolom mentioned - if its user input, you can't be sure about the content; +String is fine when you know that the string only contains numbers
[08:55:49] <rmcdaniel> yea I'm still a little confused at to what exactly I should change now
[08:56:13] <rxaviers> Good to know they are functionally not equivalent (thanks jzaefferer and agcolom). If anyone happen to know about its diff on support (across browsers), efficiency, and security, please just let me know.
[09:23:40] <arschmitz> rmcdaniel: you should do what you think is best we will review and let you know what we think.
