[02:59:36] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: ... Pong - after a long delay - sorry!
[07:01:24] <gabriels1hulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[08:14:54] <apsdehal> gabriels1hulhof: ping
[08:15:25] <apsdehal> Can you review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8350 and add comments what more needs to be done to finalize the pr?
[08:15:34] <gabriels1hulhof> apsdehal: OK.
[08:15:44] <apsdehal> Thanks a lot
[08:28:31] <arschmitz> gabriels1hulhof: Pong!
[08:54:08] <gabriels1hulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[08:54:42] <gabriels1hulhof> arschmitz: $.mobile.activePage is not deprecated according to http://jquerymobile.com/changelog/1.4.0/ ...
[08:55:00] <gabriels1hulhof> So, does that mean I can use it in tests? https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/jquery-mobile/blob/7731-selectmenu-classes-option/tests/integration/select/select_cached.js#L29
[08:55:01] <arschmitz> it should have been there 
[08:55:03] <arschmitz> no
[08:55:06] <gabriels1hulhof> OK ...
[08:55:16] <gabriels1hulhof> Then I'll go for $( ".ui-page-active" ) instead.
[08:55:20] <arschmitz> wedeffinitly did because there can be more then one active page with multiple page containers
[08:55:25] <arschmitz> gabriels1hulhof: you should use
[08:55:43] <gabriels1hulhof> Wait, right.
[08:55:50] <gabriels1hulhof> .closest( ".ui-page-active" ), right?
[08:56:35] <arschmitz> $.mobile.pageContainers.active.getActivePage();
[08:57:01] <gabriels1hulhof> Ok.
[08:58:05] <arschmitz> a little bit longer lol
[08:58:26] <arschmitz> but no selectors
[08:59:09] <gabrielschulhof> Gotcha. Will use.
[08:59:38] <gabrielschulhof> Wait a sec $.mobile.pageContainers.active is a widget, not a collection?
[09:00:27] <arschmitz> oh wait sorry
[09:00:43] <arschmitz> $.mobile.pageContainers.active.pagecontainer( "getActivePage" )
[09:02:00] <gabrielschulhof> Roger ...
[09:02:20] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: oh wait
[09:02:27] <arschmitz> thats not in 1.5 dev
[09:02:33] <arschmitz> but its ready i just need to push it
[09:02:51] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i need to run my the little guy to daycare but can do it when i get back
[09:05:26] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: NP. Drive safely!
[09:05:55] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: thankfully its only a couple miles i bike him there some times in the summer lol
[09:06:05] <gabrielschulhof> Cool!

[09:06:42] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: and believe it or not we dont have a single flake of snow yet
[09:07:19] <arschmitz> like not just none on the ground it actually has not snowed yet not even flurries 
[11:42:54] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I know ... we've had some flurries, but nothing permanent :(
