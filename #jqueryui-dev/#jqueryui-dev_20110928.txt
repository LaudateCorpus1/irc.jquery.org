[09:38:20] <gnarf> jzaefferer: pushed some Globalize stuff to the mask branch... see http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/timepicker/timepicker.html
[09:53:25] <jzaefferer> gnarf: very nice :-)
[09:54:13] <gnarf> jzaefferer: thanks, i'm trying to find a specific culture that has AM/PM values in their translations, as well as "tt" in the time format string
[09:54:33] <gnarf> right now, if you have Globalize - it wins
[09:54:38] <gnarf> the 24hr mode
[09:54:43] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:54:58] <jzaefferer> another issue: in DE culture, going up from 23 should go to 00
[09:55:05] <jzaefferer> not 12
[09:55:19] <gnarf> hrm
[09:55:21] <gnarf> wtf
[09:55:50] <jzaefferer> :-)
[09:56:03] <jzaefferer> going down from 00 works to 23, but not the other way round
[09:56:08] <gnarf> heh
[09:56:09] <gnarf> lol
[09:56:34] <gnarf> seems thats just a bug in 24hr mode
[09:56:37] <gnarf> even in en-US

[10:08:59] <gnarf> fixed
[10:10:01] <jzaefferer> do you have timepicker unit tests?
[10:10:08] <gnarf> yup, just added that to them
[10:10:09] <gnarf> :)
[10:10:13] <gnarf> it tested up from 12 -> 1
[10:10:18] <gnarf> but not up from 23 -> 0
[10:10:44] <jzaefferer> ah, nice

[13:32:27] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, any idea why we bind to element, but to instance.widget() for delegate?
[13:32:29] <jzaefferer> see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L328
[13:33:13] <scott_gonzalez> because if you're delegating, you want to be on the wrapper
[13:33:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'd be fine with binding to instance.widget() when there's no element provided
[13:34:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'm 99% sure it was your decision to keep it binding to element
[13:34:41] <scott_gonzalez> just because it was working everywhere
[13:34:46] <jzaefferer> okay, can't tell anymore
[13:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> I first noticed the delegation problem with spinner

[15:31:19] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Spinner: Added culture option. - Scott González
[15:40:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: whats up with the culture option?
[15:41:12] <scott_gonzalez> it works with the numberFormat option so that we know how to actually display the formatted value
[15:41:21] <scott_gonzalez> otherwise you can't have two spinners on a page with different cultures
[15:41:39] <gnarf> rworth and I had a talk about that when I was asking if I should make the culture an option
[15:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> I've had a comment on the wiki about it for a few weeks
[15:42:41] <gnarf> for timepicker... he seemed to be under the impression that the use case for multiple cultures there was minimal
[15:43:00] <gnarf> but if you're adding a culture option to spinner, i should probably add the same in timepicker right?
[15:43:14] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, anything that uses Globalize will need it
[15:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> a good use case for spinner would be building a currency converter
[15:43:56] <scott_gonzalez> where you pick two locations and enter a value in one field
[15:44:00] <gnarf> ya
[15:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> and the other field automatically updates
[15:44:04] <gnarf> can see that
[15:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> I could see something similar for a timezone converter
[15:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> with time pickers
[15:44:51] <gnarf> i was totally in support of having the culture option
[15:44:56] <gnarf> i think it was rworth who was against it
[15:45:06] <scott_gonzalez> well, it's obviously needed
[15:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> even if it's only a minority of users who need it, it's impossible without it
[15:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> well, not impossible, but it would certainly require some hacking
[15:46:00] <scott_gonzalez> like overriding internal methods on individual widget instances to set the culture
[15:46:23] <gnarf> agree
[15:46:34] <gnarf> i'll make it an options
[15:46:54] <scott_gonzalez> spinner is in really good shape now
[15:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> is it working well for spinning times?
[15:47:14] <gnarf> yeah, check out the demo
[15:47:16] <gnarf> its pretty hot
[15:47:22] <gnarf> even rwaldron says so

[15:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[15:48:33] <scott_gonzalez> this is kinda busted: http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/timepicker/timepicker.html
[15:48:59] <gnarf> define kinda busted?
[15:49:04] <scott_gonzalez> oh, I see what's happening
[15:49:20] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't expect that when spinning it would start on just AM/PM
[15:49:21] <jzaefferer> as in, busta rhymes?
[15:49:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, I'm kinda looking at that right now and wondering
[15:50:22] <gnarf> like from a mouse only perspective, the widget is hard to use
[15:50:24] <gnarf> keys rock
[15:50:28] <gnarf> but mouse only kinda blows
[15:50:47] <scott_gonzalez> I expected it to overflow too
[15:52:49] <gnarf> meaning the up from 59 seconds flips the minute over
[15:52:51] <gnarf> ?
[15:53:02] <gnarf> I modeled that time picker from the Mac OS X one
[15:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I've seen them work both ways
