[10:58:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: now we can post some really pissy responses right? :)
[10:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:59:04] <scott_gonzalez> YOU WANNA SEE RUDE?!?
[11:00:11] <gnarf> "I'm pretty sure he wasn't being pissy.  This is our bug tracker, not a support forum.  Please check with the forums, IRC, StackOverflow, etc."
[11:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> Seems fine.
[11:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> I think WordPress updates jQuery UI faster than UI updates core: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22290
[11:02:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: lol
[11:17:35] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez, gnarf maybe link the guy to this http://api.jqueryui.com/spinner/#event-change
[11:17:41] <ryanneufeld> cause I'm pretty sure that would work
[11:17:58] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: go for it :)
[11:19:34] <ryanneufeld> "FYI, The spinner (as most jquery ui widgets do)  as several of it's own events that you can bind to.
[11:19:34] <ryanneufeld> For example: http://api.jqueryui.com/spinner/#event-change
[11:19:34] <ryanneufeld> Unless I'm mistaken, that's a change event.  Enjoy"

[11:21:44] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: just a super quick question: since we now have a quicknav overview link, should we also add the 'Overview" title/heading to the api docs?
[11:21:49] <agcolom> hi ryanneufeld
[11:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Probably :-)

[12:40:20] <agcolom> oups pressed the return key too early!
[12:40:52] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: about that 'Overview' heading, how about adding it in the xsl file?
[12:41:07] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's a good idea.
[12:42:39] <agcolom> then that saves us editing every entry ;-)
[12:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, anything that's common should never be manually written in the entries.
[12:45:16] <agcolom> are you happy to do that?

[13:08:28] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Example shows the header, so I suppose that'd be better for Overview as well as a matter of consistency...
[13:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:09:11] <agcolom> btw, are the api docs under wordpress?
[13:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> All sites are WordPress.
[13:10:03] <agcolom> right, so can we use WordPress plugins?
[13:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:10:29] <scott_gonzalez> What plugin do you want?
[13:10:33] <agcolom> (I saw something on Dan's blog... ) let me find a link...
[13:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I'm only adding the Overview heading to widget pages.
[13:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> So method, selector, property, and event pages won't have the header.
[13:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> Since they don't have QuickNav and they contain much fewer sections.
[13:11:48] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: yes, that;s what I thought as well...
[13:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'll commit this.
[13:12:04] <agcolom> great thx!
[13:12:09] <agcolom> here's the link...

[13:13:21] <agcolom> Dan uses some WordPress plugins for the codehilighting and view source and copy to clipboard, etc... (see code sections)
[13:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we're doing our highlighting on the server.
[13:14:09] <agcolom> yes, but what do you think of the view code source?
[13:14:34] <agcolom> (just a thought... I'm not saying we should adopt this)
[13:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> It seems strange to view source of source.
[13:15:08] <agcolom> yes...
[13:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> What is the use case?
[13:15:33] <agcolom> no you're right, I want to view the source of the iframe examples....
[13:15:38] <_zoggy_> offically dropping ie6 support now ?
[13:15:55] <agcolom> so that's not what we need... sorry... I was just going mad!
[13:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: yup
[13:16:19] <agcolom> regarding the h2 Overview... should it be underlined?
[13:16:21] <_zoggy_> coo, should help clean up some things
[13:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It matches the examples header.
[13:17:04] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably drop the colon from the Examples header.
[13:17:41] <_zoggy_> you know some people are going to freak about the ie6 thing.. you guys offering the ie6 fixes as a sidecard file or you just going to tell people use 1.9 if you need legacy ie hacks
[13:17:42] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: yes, just checked. it is the underline class, you're right
[13:17:56] <agcolom> Yes we could lose the colon if you want...
[13:19:31] <agcolom> that'd probably be better...
[13:20:01] <agcolom> did Karl come back with some rules (verb in the infinitive or present tense?)
[13:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ^
[13:21:08] <kswedberg> hey scott_gonzalez
[13:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: They'll have to use 1.9.x.
[13:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be 2013, people need to stop using IE6.
[13:21:38] <_zoggy_> deff
[13:21:43] <agcolom> hey kswedberg!
[13:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> We just can't continue to support it.
[13:21:53] <kswedberg> hi agcolom
[13:22:01] <_zoggy_> yeah, i gave up on ie6/7 awhile ago
[13:22:06] <agcolom> I'm after some rules for the docs ;-)
[13:22:13] <agcolom> (English rules!)
[13:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> At least IE7 has things like fixed positioning, minHeight, etc.
[13:23:05] <agcolom> kswedberg: I'll look for an example...
[13:23:20] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez, agcolom: Looks like UI is all over the map with its description of Boolean properties: http://oksoclap.com/jqui-verbs
[13:23:23] <_zoggy_> so any plans to revamp the buttons in jui? i love jui and all but i ended up adding bootstrap's buttons to my project (with some hacks on top of it)
[13:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: That's because the docs were written by multiple people.
[13:24:00] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't bring myself to do a grammar/consistency review.
[13:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> I was super stressed when I was working on docs.
[13:24:38] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i get it. not criticizing. just saying that there is a much greater variety than "disable" or "disables"
[13:24:57] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: We're doing a refactor of buttons in 1.11.
[13:25:58] <kswedberg> I don't have a strong preference for any of them, but I'm not a big fan of "Whether ..."
[13:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: It'd be good to get any ideas/feedback you have up on the wiki: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Button
[13:26:44] <_zoggy_> wonder if there is a 'metro' jui theme
[13:26:47] <kswedberg> gotta run. there's a party going on at work, and I'm the only one "working."
[13:26:47] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: I prefer "Disables..."
[13:26:55] <_zoggy_> with the launch of win8 yesterday and all
[13:27:59] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: So, would you move all the "if set to true" phrases to after the main clause?
[13:28:01] <agcolom> I tend to prefer that too...
[13:28:09] <_zoggy_> blah dont have an account on the wiki. was hoping the one for bugs would work. creating account now
[13:28:49] <_zoggy_> well requesting access now
[13:29:05] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: I guess so. I'm fine with whatever. I just want it to be consistent :-P
[13:29:28] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: We're looking into switching to a GitHub wiki.
[13:29:39] <scott_gonzalez> But we need to get email notifications set up.
[13:29:39] <kswedberg> gotta run.
[13:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> Enjoy the party, kswedberg.
[13:30:01] <kswedberg> thx
[13:30:15] <agcolom> kswedberg: ok, I'll add stuff to your doc.... enjoy the party :-)
[13:30:35] <_zoggy_> hmm these buttons are deff more metro than most other libs buttons.. very blocky
