[06:24:23] <kswedberg> nacin, jzaefferer: I already put the plugin in there, but I renamed the file to jquery-html-category-desc.php
[06:24:33] <nacin> kswedberg: okay, looking
[06:24:40] <kswedberg> ↑ I put it in web-base-template
[06:24:57] <kswedberg> cool, thx, nacin.
[06:25:04] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: oh, okay. So that alone doesn't seem to help, if the import is still stripping html
[06:25:35] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: right on. I mentioned this to rworth the other day, but I don't think he has had a chance to look into it.
[06:25:45] <kswedberg> so, nacin, anything you can do to help would be awesome! :)
[06:25:47] <jzaefferer> right
[06:25:49] <jzaefferer> yep!
[06:26:15] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: any idea why the index entries here don't show category links? http://stage.api.qunitjs.com/
[06:26:24] <kswedberg> It looks like it's only stripping top-level elements (or maybe just block-level?)
[06:26:27] <jzaefferer> that part seems to work fine on all other API sites, just not here
[06:26:47] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: block-level seems about right, <code> etc still works
[06:27:14] <nacin> kswedberg: where is ks_term_description() used?
[06:27:40] <nacin> looks like most of that file is unused.
[06:27:46] <kswedberg> hmmm. dunno.
[06:27:51] <kswedberg> could be.
[06:28:08] <nacin> I guess it was designed to be a template tag.
[06:28:45] <kswedberg> I wish I could remember.
[06:29:18] <kswedberg> oh wait. I think I have a cleaner version of it in a different branch.
[06:30:01] <kswedberg> …or not. sorry, nacin. my hackery is being exposed again! :)

[06:30:16] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Tooltip: Document track option. Fixes #9 - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:31:49] <nacin> kswedberg: it actually looks good. it doesn't work for one little reason. it only fires in the admin or during ajax requests. but XML-RPC is neither.
[06:32:12] <kswedberg> aha. but I bet you can fix that! ;)
[06:33:27] <nacin> can you guys confirm that this works? https://gist.github.com/2954193
[06:33:59] <kswedberg> nacin, just replace the whole file with that?
[06:34:06] <nacin> hah. yes.
[06:34:18] <kswedberg> beautiful. will test now.
[06:40:50] <kswedberg> nacin, that didn't appear to fix the issue.
[06:41:37] <kswedberg> it looks right in taxonomies.json, but it doesn't get imported into the db correctly
[06:41:45] <kswedberg> or something like that
[06:42:00] <nacin> are you using a super admin for grunt-wordpress's config?
[06:50:27] <kswedberg> yes
[06:50:35] <kswedberg> nacin ↑
[06:50:58] <nacin> hm. can someone help me set up grunt-wordpress so I can run proper tests?
[06:52:04] <kswedberg> nacin: I don't understand. what do you need to set up? do you have node and npm installed? have you run npm install from the repo's root dir?
[06:52:34] <nacin> no and no :)
[06:53:21] <kswedberg> ah! ok, so first thing is to install node! :) (I'm pretty sure npm comes bundled with it now, not sure, though).
[06:53:28] <nacin> working through that.
[06:53:32] <kswedberg> do you have homebrew?
[06:53:34] <nacin> yes
[06:53:39] <kswedberg> brew install node
[06:53:51] <kswedberg> *off the top of my head
[07:15:01] <jzaefferer> I can confirm that npm is now bundled with node :-_
[07:15:04] <jzaefferer> uh
[07:15:24] <jzaefferer> :^(
[07:15:49] <jzaefferer> nacin: if you're on OSX, use their installer
[07:16:01] <jzaefferer> that's a lot faster then compiling from source, what brew does...
[07:16:07] <nacin> jzaefferer: thanks
[07:21:07] <jzaefferer> nacin: other then that, the READMEs should have all you need. I suspect the one thing you'll have missing is pygmentize
[07:21:43] <jzaefferer> then its just a matter of taking the config-sample.json, making a config.json copy and putting your local WP admin props in their
[07:21:46] <jzaefferer> *there
[07:48:55] <FJ1> i have a question about "spinner".
[07:50:37] <FJ1> i have a "listener" on a spinner.. like this $("#myspinner").on("change",…..) but there is no "change event" when i click "up" or "down" :-/
[07:55:23] <jzaefferer> FJ1: change is triggered on blur, if the value changed - you should listen to "spin" instead
[07:56:02] <FJ1> perfect. thx!
[07:56:50] <jzaefferer> you're welcome :-)
[07:56:52] <jzaefferer> nacin: let me know if you need anything to test locally
[07:57:25] <nacin> jzaefferer: cool, working on another project, should be back on this in the next hour or so
[08:00:19] <jzaefferer> alright
[08:00:46] <jzaefferer> with Scott not around for the week and me leaving for SF tomorrow I'm getting a little nervous about all these not really finished sites...

[13:54:15] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: quick question if you're here
[13:59:10] <mikesherov_> actually, anybody... is this expected behavior? http://jsfiddle.net/LTet4/2/
[13:59:36] <mikesherov_> what's happening here is that the dialog is larger than the viewport, and so the position of 100px is ignored
