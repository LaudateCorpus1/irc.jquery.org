[02:43:12] <vark> Hi all
[02:44:14] <vark> I've just made a minor addition to datepicker (jQuery UI) to allow the date selection boxes to be moved in a multiple month scenario, as this wasn't already possible. What is the best way to submit this for possible use for others or checking I've not just badly broken anything
[02:44:42] <vark> (by date selection boxes I mean the month and year selectors, as their functioning in multi-month scenarios was causing user confusion)
[04:06:44] <vark> [lurking, if anyone saw my previous I have a diff but no idea where to submit it to for the select elements on datepicker months/years to move them to the same place the active month is (or any other month place)]

[18:14:59] <Vark> Hi - is anyone awake in here today? :)

[19:57:14] <Vark> Hi again - anyone here?
[21:13:49] <Vark> Is the forum the only place to put suggestions for enhancements, given the Trac system appears to be broken?
[21:21:04] <arschmitz> Vark: what trouble are you having with track?
[21:21:18] <arschmitz> Vark: also we are re-writing datepicker right now its almost done
[21:23:08] <Vark> arschmitz - I know it's being rewritten, but the rewrite doesn't include in the (wiki?) info page the functionality I'm after
[21:23:15] <Vark> Which is a patch of about 7 lines :)
[21:23:38] <arschmitz> @vark its a total re-write
[21:23:46] <arschmitz> @vark so your patch would not apply
[21:24:08] <arschmitz> Vark: you should post in the wiki your suggested functionality
[21:24:15] <Vark> Understand the patch wouldn't, but the functionality may be useful (it's confused a userbase of 10K users so far since I used the multi-month function)
[21:24:17] <arschmitz> so we can consider it for the re-write 
[21:24:31] <Vark> ars - I've raised an entry in the forum, as that's about the only place I could
[21:24:52] <arschmitz> Vark: we dont check the forum very much you should do it in the wiki or trac
[21:25:03] <arschmitz> what trouble are you having with trac im able to log in and create issues
[21:25:37] <Vark> Yup, and trac says "TICKET_CREATE privileges are required" - OK, so it offers me to log in (click on Do So) - and it says "No handler matched to request to /login"
[21:26:15] <Vark> (started at bugs.jqueryui.com)
[21:26:52] <Vark> Happy to add the request to Trac or to the Wiki if I could find a way to do so successfully!
[21:27:35] <arschmitz> Vark: you should be able to reqest access to the wiki for commenting if you have not already
[21:27:43] <arschmitz> thats where we do our planning
[21:28:38] <arschmitz> Vark: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137778/Datepicker
[21:29:54] <Vark> OK - access requested (I think!)
[21:30:30] <Vark> @arschmitz: Thanks for taking the time to help also :)
[21:30:42] <arschmitz> Vark: giving you access now
[21:31:38] <arschmitz> Vark: should be good
[21:32:09] <arschmitz> Vark: on bugs.jqueryui.com can you on the front page click the login link 
[21:32:19] <arschmitz> and see if you get the same error because i just logged in there
[21:34:37] <Vark> I can see (and successfully use) the GitHub Login link
[21:35:01] <Vark> But the "do so" link from New Ticket remains broken
[21:35:06] <Vark> https://bugs.jqueryui.com/newticket
[21:35:30] <arschmitz> Vark: thank you will look into that
[21:35:31] <Vark> (goes to https://bugs.jqueryui.com/login)
[21:35:46] <arschmitz> Vark: ah old link
[21:35:53] <arschmitz> we upgraded track a couple months ago
[21:43:09] <Vark> The wiki ate my comment! - do they get moderated, before I try and repost it
[21:56:14] <arschmitz> um dont think so let me check
[22:01:24] <Vark> Is OK - gave it a while, then retried, and it's gone through onto the comments this time
[22:02:48] <Vark> Fingers crossed it's as easy to do as it was in the current version, I'll just use my modified current one for now to help out the users
[22:03:55] <Vark> Thanks again for the assistance
[22:09:08] <arschmitz> Vark: i can point you to the new code
[22:09:10] <arschmitz> its on github
[22:09:22] <Vark> OK - happy to take a look
[22:09:56] <arschmitz> Vark: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/datepicker
[22:12:33] <Vark> Browsing now
[22:13:46] <Vark> So all the main functionality is now in calendar.js ?
[22:25:41] <arschmitz> Vark: the calendar.js is exactly what it sounds like its just display a calendar
[22:25:58] <arschmitz> datepicker.js uses calendar.js to make a datepicker
[22:26:23] <Vark> OK - trying to find the equivalent that makes the selectable month and year in the top of existing datepicker
[22:30:10] <Vark> Looks like showCurrentAtPos has vanished, listed as "preserve?" on the Wiki, not in datepicker or calendar, can't see how I'd have a 3 month display with the active month in the middle now (i.e. prev month - this month - next month)
[22:34:55] <arschmitz> Vark: fnagle is the one to ask about that he has done the whole re-write
[22:35:38] <Vark> @arschmitz: Thanks, will look out for them to ask :)
[22:36:04] <arschmitz> Vark: just post in the comments on the wiki if you want too he checks and responds there
[22:36:50] <Vark> arschmitz: Already placed a comment, so I'll wait patiently :)
