[03:57:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping
[04:25:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[04:25:24] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[04:26:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when I revert option inset for textinput do I need to change anything in filterable.backcompat.js?
[04:26:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You shouldn't need to.
[04:26:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok thanks, already thought so but wanted to be sure
[04:27:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It loops over all the options in $.mobile.textinput.prototype.options and copies the ones it finds from the widget to the textinput.
[04:27:20] <uGoMobi> nice
[04:27:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if inset is not among the options in $.mobile.textinput.prototype.options, it won't get copied.
[04:27:31] <uGoMobi> then it should be just fine
[04:27:36] <uGoMobi> yup
[04:27:41] <_|Nix|_> Just Fineâ„¢
[04:27:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/e537114051adf5eb6e54a4aafe47e2d90035a3e5#L0R152
[04:27:55] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Gabriel Schulhof (3w 3d ago): Textinput: Introduce option "inset".
[04:28:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when do we use toggleClass
[04:28:36] <uGoMobi> I reverted to addClass / removeClass
[04:28:40] <uGoMobi> like it was
[04:28:57] <uGoMobi> but like to know when we can use that
[04:29:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: .toggleClass() should be used there.
[04:29:22] <uGoMobi> aha
[04:29:42] <_|Nix|_> .toggleClass( "classname", true/false ) will make sure that "classname" is present if true, and it will make sure that "classname" is absent if false.
[04:30:06] <_|Nix|_> It should be outer.toggleClass( "ui-corner-all", options.corners );
[04:30:14] <uGoMobi> looks like that for mini it has been changed back to addClass/removeClass
[04:30:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh wait, ignore that
[04:31:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's bad. mini should also be handled via toggleClass.
[04:31:11] <uGoMobi> it just because that commit didn't show all lines
[04:31:12] <_|Nix|_> Wait.
[04:31:29] <_|Nix|_> I may have avoided toggleClass for performance reasons.
[04:31:48] <uGoMobi> wait also :) it has been changed
[04:31:55] <uGoMobi> I see
[04:32:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In master it's removeClass/addClass, not toggleClass ...
[04:32:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Man ... I did a jsperf for this ...
[04:32:50] <uGoMobi> yeah, I see it now.. was looking at 3 diff versions at same time
[04:33:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Here's a different, unrelated, but interesting result: http://jsperf.com/two-attr-vs-one
[04:35:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: very interesting, kinda unexpected too
[04:35:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know, eh?
[04:39:37] <_|Nix|_> OK. The history of options.mini does not show any concern for performance of toggleClass vs. addClass/removeClass.
[04:39:48] <_|Nix|_> I think we should use toggleClass, because that's the simplest.
[04:55:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I thought <button> elements don't need a wrapper. Or was it <input> elements?
[04:55:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We still wrap both <button> and <input>.
[04:55:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: button elements don't get wrapper anymore
[04:55:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: where?
[04:56:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They do in master.

[04:56:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: button uses buttonMarkup function
[04:56:51] <uGoMobi> could it be it only happens when you add the (unneeded) data-role="button"?
[04:57:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Could be.
[04:57:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, no. It happens if you only include widgets/forms/button
[04:57:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, custom build.
[04:58:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/6288.ht,;
[04:58:12] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[04:58:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/6288.html
[04:59:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: button should not be enhancing <button>
[04:59:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, this is a bug
[04:59:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Weird ... the initSelector for button does not include <button>
[04:59:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe it's not removed from initSelector in button widget?
[05:00:00] <uGoMobi> hmm
[05:00:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll trace it.
[05:00:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks
[05:01:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hyunsook has been setting up pages with custom builds and she uncovered https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6288, the fact that jquery.mobile.widget does not depend on jquery.mobile.data, even though it calls $.mobile.getAttribute from _getCreateOptions().
[05:01:31] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6288 by hyunsook (1w 2d ago): Download Builder(latest): A input or button-based Button widget has an error.
[05:01:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I decided to start a new test suite: tests/unit/individual-modules, where I'll start with her sample page.
[05:02:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's a place where we test widgets outside of pages.
[05:02:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For now, test simply whether they are enhanced correctly.
[05:02:33] <uGoMobi> yeah, great that they are testing that
[05:03:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I also noticed that we don't incude the right CSS for buttons with the download builder
[05:08:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I'm an idiot. I'm intentionally calling .button() on a <button> ...
[05:08:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, $( "button" ).button();
[05:08:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, of course it'll create a button widget.
[05:08:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ahh
[05:09:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: same happens when you call buttonMarkup on input button
[05:09:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm, I need to autoenhance the whole body instead.
[05:09:31] <_|Nix|_> Of course.
[05:09:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll have to do autoinit by hand.
[05:09:55] <uGoMobi> $( "body" ).enhanceWithin()?
[05:10:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not sure.

[05:46:38] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:48:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: everything ok with your friend?
[05:49:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so so, have to see how things go with his girlfriend
[05:49:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks
[05:49:30] <arschmitz> your welcome
[05:49:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you hppen to catch what i did with dialog yesterday?
[05:49:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, awesome!
[05:50:27] <arschmitz> im just finishing adapting tests from dialog to test the extension
[05:51:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you're totally right that we need to introduce the new solution already when we deprecate something
[05:51:31] <arschmitz> yeah i know at least one other case to fix
[05:51:40] <arschmitz> but its a super simple one just related to varibles
[05:52:15] <arschmitz> so ill fix that as soon as i finish dialog tests
[05:52:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: already switched the dialog demo page to use extension for all of them
[05:53:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great!
[05:54:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this also deprecates setting data-rel="dialog" on links are you ok with that?
[05:54:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: because its just an option on page
[05:56:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i couldnt remeber if we talked about that we we talked about deprecating dialog already or not
[05:57:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm not sure about this
[05:57:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: why did we add that feature?
[05:57:59] <arschmitz> allowed you to open a page as a dialog if you wanted to for some reason
[05:58:06] <arschmitz> which i dont even think makes sense really
[05:59:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I don't know why either
[05:59:46] <arschmitz> generally it would really mess with any sort of page that has custom css
[05:59:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you design a page to be dialog or not
[06:00:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: exactly
[06:00:17] <uGoMobi> so you set dialog on the page
[06:00:18] <arschmitz> like just out of curiosity i opened some pages in the docs as dialogs
[06:00:28] <arschmitz> and they were all busted lol
[06:00:40] <uGoMobi> yeah I can imagine
[06:01:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am fine with getting rid of it, just wasn't sure if it was added to resolve some problem
[06:01:42] <arschmitz> all iv ever seen documented about it is that it gives you the ability to open a page as a dialog
[06:02:08] <uGoMobi> ok then we deprecate it
[06:02:11] <arschmitz> cool
[06:19:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! Tweaked _getCreateOptions a bit: http://jsperf.com/getcreateoptions-improvement
[06:20:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Got rid of $.each() and moved the replace callback and regex to the outer IIFE.
[06:21:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool
[06:21:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and as far as dependencies your were talking about earlier
[06:22:03] <arschmitz> there are more places like that becasue everything that previously depended on core still does and core is just a define of data,defaults, and helpers
[06:22:31] <arschmitz> at some point we need to go through all the amd definitions and review this
[06:22:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but widget did not depend on core.
[06:23:34] <arschmitz> well it should have lol
[06:23:46] <arschmitz> it used jqm data
[06:25:29] <rxaviers> uGoMobi, Hi Jasper, are you guys going to change mobile to use UMD wrappers?
[06:25:50] <arschmitz> rxaviers: we are but we need to update our downlaod builder first
[06:26:08] <arschmitz> the umd wrappers would break it currently
[06:26:11] <uGoMobi> hi rxaviers !
[06:26:48] <rxaviers> I see
[06:27:55] <rxaviers> I have updated UI's download builder to use requirejs to do so (and it doesn't need the use of pragmas), just let me know and I could show where it is.
[06:28:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. That's what Hyunsook uncovered when she tested widgets/forms/button in a custom build.
[06:28:21] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yeah iv been following what you have been doing with it
[06:28:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh ok i guess i miss understood i thought you were saying it the other way around that it had dependency and didnt need it
[06:29:18] <arschmitz> rxaviers: would very much like to share a download builder in the near future
[06:29:37] <rxaviers> yeap, that would be great
[06:29:45] <arschmitz> rxaviers: how is it working with css?
[06:29:46] <rxaviers> not trivial yet though
[06:30:00] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yeah im sure
[06:31:29] <rxaviers> if download was only js bundle, it would be really easy to merge. But, themes and some other structures are tough. There are so many ad-hoc things.
[06:31:46] <arschmitz> yup
[06:32:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No. The base class was breaking in a button-only custom build. The unit tests did not catch that because all of them include init so they get autoinit. init depends on core, so it was getting pulled in.
[06:32:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i gotcha now
[06:32:57] <rxaviers> on mobile, do you build using grunt tasks as well? Do you need to update any grunt task before UMD wrappers chang?
[06:32:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I added tests/unit/individual-modules for a place to test individual module behaviour. So far, I've only added the button one.
[06:33:40] <arschmitz> rxaviers: https://github.com/gseguin/node-amd-builder
[06:33:40] <_|Nix|_> rxaviers: Yeah, we use r.js in the build process, and we have a Christmas-tree file in our source directory that depends on everything.
[06:38:39] <rxaviers> nice thanks

[07:14:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: To display longer table header text in the column chooser or reflow labels, wrap the text in the TH with a abbr element and set the title. This string will be used in place.
[07:14:59] <tj_vantoll> I think the concern is valid. Wouldn't this fail if the input had no silbings at all as well?

[09:01:43] <fnagel> dev meeting?
[09:04:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[09:04:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[09:05:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think ( and this can be 1.4 or 1.5 ) we should deprecate data-role="content" and just have people add .ui-content if they want it
[09:05:28] <arschmitz> and same with contentTheme on page
[09:05:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I agree
[09:05:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what do you think? its kinda like field contain where all it does is add a class
[09:06:00] <arschmitz> cool
[09:06:04] <arschmitz> you think 1.4 or 1.5
[09:06:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: only thing we have to look at is the ARIA role
[09:06:18] <uGoMobi> we add role="main"
[09:06:30] <uGoMobi> but we can document that of course
[09:06:44] <arschmitz> yeah i think that makes more sense
[09:06:53] <arschmitz> because you can have multiple data-role content
[09:06:58] <arschmitz> or none
[09:07:05] <uGoMobi> we want to make that configurable anyway (also for the toolbars)
[09:07:08] <arschmitz> which makes the aria roll get weird i would thing
[09:08:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe we should stop adding the roles to header, content, footer
[09:08:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: makes sense because you can use a header just as a bar in your page too
[09:09:08] <arschmitz> it does not have to actually be a header
[09:09:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5650#issuecomment-17333655
[09:09:55] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5650 by vick08 (5mon 3w ago): Make the presence of ARIA landmarks inside pages configurable
[09:10:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so should i add to 1.4 deprecated list or wait for 1.5 you think?
[09:11:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think we can deprecate this in 1.4
[09:11:44] <arschmitz> sounds good
[09:12:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: because you can already use the new solution adding the class
[09:12:12] <arschmitz> yup
[09:12:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have all tests ported and passing for dialog extension
[09:12:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am just thinking if we should add option "addariarole" to toolbars and page (for content) in 1.4 and deprecate that when we add it
[09:13:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome!
[09:13:06] <arschmitz> just making one last change to page so both page and dialog have enhanced option.
[09:13:40] <uGoMobi> ok perfect
[09:14:08] <arschmitz> i think the extra time and second alpha have been very productive
[09:14:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I am really happy about all the issues that we fixed after alpha 1
[09:15:11] <uGoMobi> things look pretty steady so I have even been thinking do we really need another alpha
[09:15:20] <uGoMobi> but probably better to do alpha 2
[09:15:42] <uGoMobi> so people that were already testing alpha 1 can test 2
[09:16:07] <uGoMobi> then we can do beta maybe end of next week
[09:17:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I forgot what we decided to do about this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6225
[09:17:55] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6225 by RedWolves (2w 2d ago): Filter: Filtering a SELECT element causes unexpected experience
[09:18:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think we should we can let it only simmer for like a week or so
[09:19:08] <arschmitz> but there have been substantial changes like a whole new widget extension lol
[09:19:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I was thinking the same
[09:19:18] <arschmitz> and like 20 new deprecations
[09:19:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: true
[09:19:45] <uGoMobi> and we need time to update all docs and demos
[09:19:45] <arschmitz> so i think ship it then ship beta like 1 week later 
[09:19:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: agreed
[09:20:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I still believe that the button should always reflect the value selected.
[09:20:05] <arschmitz> 2 at most unless something big comes up 
[09:20:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... even if that value is no longer available from the list of values.
[09:20:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, I agree with that
[09:20:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... because of the filtering that's going on.
[09:20:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The problem is that the classes are getting copied.
[09:20:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just don't remember how we were going to fix it
[09:21:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's difficult because ui-screen-hidden adds display: none !important;
[09:21:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[09:21:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we can add a higher specificity rule wil display: block !important;
[09:21:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But that's hacky.
[09:21:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: !important can be overridden
[09:22:04] <uGoMobi> right
[09:22:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can it be overridden without adding another !important?
[09:22:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no !important in combination with higher specificity
[09:22:55] <_|Nix|_> Right, so ... hacky.
[09:23:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so the question is are we going to override with CSS or use JS to prevent adding ui-screen-hidden
[09:23:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suppose I could make a special case for it when we copy the classes ...
[09:24:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, just bit worried about performance
[09:24:06] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#678 (master - 6e7c295 : Jasper de Groot): The build is still failing.

[09:24:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not such a big worry, because it's not happening at startup. It's happening in response to a user selection.
[09:26:00] <uGoMobi> yeah, biggest performance issue is with startup of custom select
[09:26:20] <uGoMobi> but I thought we were doing quite some things already when refreshing
[09:27:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: to win a bit at the same time... we copy classes from the selected option and the select itself to the span
[09:27:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think we need to copy classes from the select
[09:27:37] <uGoMobi> only the option
[09:29:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[09:29:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lemme push the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6053 (grunt test running now) and then I'll have a look at that.
[09:29:43] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6053 by DerGuteWolf (2mon 2w ago): abbr title in th not picked up for column toggle
[09:29:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great, thanks!
[09:30:34] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! checkboxradio tests failing ?!
[09:30:47] <_|Nix|_> I never touched that.
[09:30:56] <gseguin> I didn't do it
[09:31:03] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: :)
[09:31:10] <uGoMobi> still your fault gseguin 
[09:31:23] <gseguin> what's up folks ?
[09:31:29] <gseguin> ready for alpha.2?
[09:32:18] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Chugging along ... can you take a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/00504f4d3b8a5a6541520d18de7c45d1f9ed2032 ?
[09:32:18] <gseguin> I thought Wilto was always the guilty one, when did I get promoted?
[09:32:18] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Gabriel Schulhof (3h 4m ago): Gruntfile.js: Tests: Filter out paths that do not exist.  For example, tests/unit/<something>/ would attempt to run tests/unit/<something>/index.html, which is present in most cases, but if not, the entire test run would fail, thus obliging us to provide a tests/unit/<something>/index.html for all <something>. With this change, we can have a directory without index.html, while still running *-tests.html ...
[09:32:33] <Wilto> DAMMIT, WILTâ€” wait
[09:32:43] <gseguin> lol :)
[09:32:58] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:33:29] <_|Nix|_> :)
[09:33:43] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: so that's failing?
[09:33:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Nono. Just wanted your eyes on it.
[09:33:57] <gseguin> oh ok
[09:34:12] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Make sure I didn't short-circuit, like, half our automated tests :)
[09:34:25] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: use path.join to do path concat
[09:34:38] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Aaaah! Cool!
[09:34:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Will do.
[09:35:21] <_|Nix|_> OK, now checkboxradio is fine ... weird ...
[09:36:18] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I commented 
[09:42:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Right. I have something similar.
[09:42:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I only wish to append index.html if the existing path ends in a "/".
[09:43:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Otherwise I wish to check the existence of the unmodified path.
[09:43:31] <gseguin> oh ok, then use path.sep
[09:43:57] <gseguin> I'm trying to make sure we right it in a windows friendly way
[09:44:05] <gseguin> though I've never tested it on windows
[09:44:18] <gseguin> so there are probably places that break
[09:46:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK. So, break up the path, add index.html, and then join it back together, right?
[09:47:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll re-write it.
[10:02:29] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: you can check if p ends with path.sep
[10:02:58] <gseguin> then path.join( p, "index.html" ) and check for existence

[10:08:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[10:12:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: $.mobile.activePageClass, btnclass, focus class
[10:12:43] <arschmitz> i vagule remember you saying these were deprecated ? or something with these but i cant find it now
[10:13:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't recall
[10:13:14] <arschmitz> hmmm ok 
[10:13:21] <arschmitz> those are all still used though right?
[10:13:26] <arschmitz> currently
[10:14:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah think so but I don't think we use them consistent
[10:14:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: like in panel we use $( ".ui-page-active" )
[10:14:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im just moving them to $.mobile.classes but keeping backcompat to address https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6300
[10:14:45] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6300 by scottgonzalez (1w 1d ago): Remove $.mobile.*Class settings
[10:16:03] <arschmitz> we can decide to actually remove or not for 1.5 just moving them into an object for now
[10:16:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: think we need to do a search 
[10:16:11] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:16:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah this wont effect any current code because of backcompat
[10:16:44] <uGoMobi> I understand
[10:16:55] <arschmitz> cool
[10:17:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but do you think those classes should be configurable?
[10:17:10] <arschmitz> not really lol
[10:17:23] <uGoMobi> neither do I
[10:17:24] <arschmitz> if you want to change style just override with css 
[10:17:30] <arschmitz> no need to actually change class
[10:17:41] <arschmitz> so maybe just regular old deprecate and not move then?
[10:18:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im fine either way on this but if we both think they should not be configurable then should probably just deprecate and remove?
[10:21:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah let's deprecate
[10:21:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but for 1.4 this should work so I should change panel.js
[10:22:04] <arschmitz> ok sounds like a plan
[10:22:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I added some custom CSS http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/examples/filterable/filter-inside-selectmenu.php
[10:22:48] <uGoMobi> cool demo
[10:24:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: adding a filter makes more sense when it's a long list so maybe we should add one that uses a dialog because I don't think my CSS will work in that case
[10:26:31] <uGoMobi> hmm I just noticed that it's possible to open a select and get a popup menu, change screen size (rotate device), open again and you get a dialog :(
[10:27:24] <uGoMobi> well selectmenu dialog is flagged for removal anyway

[11:37:36] <uGoMobi> ?tell gseguin : I pinged you about this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder/issues/41#issuecomment-22657142
[11:38:00] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, that's the thing.. CLDR does say you should use it for en-IN. en-IN is a language :P.. Although, it does map a currency per territory.. So, it tells you INR is used in India, or BRL is used in Brasil.
[11:38:15] <rxaviers> USD in USA
[11:38:45] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Iâ€™ll tell gseguin about that.
[11:40:02] <rxaviers> You can get a list of the territories of a language with supplemental.languageData.<lang>["@territories"]
[11:40:30] <rxaviers> for each territory, get a list of its currencies (by using supplemental.currencyData.region.<territory>)

[12:19:27] <arschmitz> some thoughts on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5982
[12:19:31] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #5982 by uGoMobi (3mon 6d ago): Remove 'jquery.mobile' prefix (CSS) and fix file order (JS)
[12:19:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[12:19:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was actually wondering if we should do the opposite
[12:20:07] <arschmitz> and move to a file structure more like ui's
[12:20:40] <arschmitz> it will make it so things would work together more easily and make it easier to eventually share a download builder
[12:21:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good point
[12:21:40] <arschmitz> we could pretty much use exactly the same file structure as them
[12:21:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: as long as we are consistent between JS and CSS
[12:22:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: have you looked at the ui file structure?
[12:22:29] <uGoMobi> looking now
[12:22:58] <arschmitz> i think mobile started like ui but changed at some point
[12:23:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes we changed the JS at some point
[12:24:35] <arschmitz> so what do you think i think consistency wins here both between projects and file types  js / css 
[12:24:50] <arschmitz> if we just move to ui's structure
[12:24:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: +1 to doing same as UI
[12:25:15] <arschmitz> awesome so maybe update that issue to switch to match ui?
[12:25:25] <uGoMobi> that  is in line with project goal
[12:25:31] <arschmitz> yup
[12:25:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes let's rename

[12:41:04] <arschmitz> yup look at all the 1.3 issues
[12:41:40] <uGoMobi> so if we want to do it before 1.4 final we should do it now so issues popup before final
[12:41:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: either way
[12:41:59] <uGoMobi> but we don't have time now
[12:42:05] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:42:17] <arschmitz> i dont anyway thats kinda a time consuming change lol
[12:42:25] <uGoMobi> it sure is
[12:55:38] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Still around?
[12:56:25] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#685 (master - a39997c : Jasper de Groot): The build was fixed.
[12:56:25] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/0f81fe48e6e1...a39997ca41ca
[12:56:25] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/10212304
[12:57:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course it's possible to get a popup sometimes and a dialog other times. The decision as to whether to show a popup or a dialog is made during opening.
[12:57:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I thought that was a feature.
[12:58:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Re: dialog extension: Awesome!
[12:58:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  actually I didn't remember the logic that defines popup or dialog
[13:00:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so I am not saying it's a bug, just that I don't really like the behaviour
[13:04:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do we really need to declare that the behaviour of the custom select whereby it displays the menu as a dialog is deprecated as of 1.4.0?
[13:05:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no I don't think so. it's not a feature on itself
[13:06:18] <arschmitz> i would officially deprecate i think its a pretty big change in behavior and devs should have time to adjust
[13:06:33] <uGoMobi> how can you adjust?
[13:06:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not gonna break anything if that doesn't happen anymore.
[13:08:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: most likely they wont
[13:08:27] <uGoMobi> at some point we changed it to use poup too
[13:08:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but that was a small change.
[13:08:49] <arschmitz> but they could use a different widget or adjust to avoid long lists or what ever 
[13:08:52] <uGoMobi> but I don't have a problem with mentioning it somewhere
[13:08:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Popup is actually based on custom select menu!
[13:09:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I ripped the part of custom select menu that created the popup and rolled it into a widget of its own.
[13:09:30] <arschmitz> or yell until we come up with some sort of replacement lol
[13:09:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think if it's behaviour that doesn't break anything, we can deprecate without providing a replacement.
[13:10:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's not like we're making things inaccessible.
[13:10:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Even the list of states is fully accessible when in a popup.
[13:10:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The popup /will/ ultimately increase the height of the document if it doesn't fit within the existing height.
[13:11:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, it'll be like an inset list.
[13:11:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there is no replacement here or even about it we NEED to the fact is what the reason to NOT if we are already planning the change in 1.5 ?? 
[13:11:42] <arschmitz> is there any reason to not let people know about the change?
[13:11:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, no. I'm absolutely in favour of letting people know.
[13:12:09] <uGoMobi> too late, this is a public channel ;)
[13:12:41] <arschmitz> lol
[13:12:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm just saying that, unlike with API-breaking stuff, we need not worry about a replacement, because this doesn't break anything.
[13:13:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and well there is no real replacment lol we are just removing it
[13:13:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, I'd say this is pseudo-private in that we have security by obscurity.
[13:13:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it's like "We gone stop doin' that from now on, mmmkay?"
[13:14:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Things will definitely lean more heavily on the popup as a result, but it should be OK.
[13:14:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well we did talk about having it fall back to native but who knows 
[13:14:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and also there is UI select menu being worked on
[13:14:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, that might be a bad idea, because the native is wrapped differently.
[13:14:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: One is wrapped in a div, the other in an anchor - I forget which gets which.
[13:15:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean the button.
[13:15:09] <arschmitz> which i have been testing and commenting on 
[13:16:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess ultimately mobile will be relegated to providing tie-ins for the native widgets to the UI widgets
[13:16:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because AFAIK UI widgets are pure HTML. Just divs moving about.
[13:16:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not really 
[13:17:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: their select menu is based on a select element
[13:17:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, really?
[13:17:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ...
[13:17:33] <arschmitz> and there is already talk about adding a keepNative option to match mobile
[13:17:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, not like you can $( "<div></div>" ).appendTo( "body" ).selectmenu()?
[13:17:46] <arschmitz> and a long screen fall back to keepnative style
[13:17:56] <arschmitz> dont think so
[13:18:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, that is indeed very similar to ours.
[13:18:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: does not have those features yet but its being discussed
[13:18:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Kinda disappoint too, though. I was hoping we could achieve a separation between the rendering and the functionality.
[13:18:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... for all widgets.
[13:19:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Prime example being the slider.
[13:19:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and iv already made an extended version that works in mobile as a drop in 
[13:19:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It shouldn't require an input with min, max, step, and value.
[13:19:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Pure create-and-move-divs-about widgets would be ideal, if you ask me, with native tie-ins as extensions.
[13:20:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah but a select menu would be weird without you knoe options lol
[13:20:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No.
[13:20:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It should be like filterable: Take the children of this.element and present them as a menu.
[13:20:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: filterable doesn't care about whose children they are.
[13:21:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It takes any list of children.
[13:21:07] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:21:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If they happen to be <options>s of a <select>, well, *shrug*.
[13:22:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But, anyway. This is most likely a quest for another time.
[13:22:22] <arschmitz> yup
[13:22:56] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #6053: abbr title in th not picked up for column toggle  02http://git.io/b0IZzA
[13:26:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think the reason classes are added both from the select and the currently selected option is that initially, when no option is selected, classes are added only from the select itself.
[13:26:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6225
[13:26:34] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6225 by RedWolves (2w 2d ago): Filter: Filtering a SELECT element causes unexpected experience
[13:26:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So I'm not sure we should remove that. People may have come to expect that.
[13:27:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think then we should deprecate it in favor of wrapperClass
[13:27:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, for now I'll just filter out the ui-screen-hidden class.
[13:27:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good point.
[13:27:58] <uGoMobi> keyword for 1.4: DEPRECATE
[13:28:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Definitely.
[13:28:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we didn't add wrapperClass to selectmenu yet, right?
[13:28:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You know what this reminds me of? Hungary. The current government's been doing a lot of deprecation too. Their slogan is "Hungary is becoming renewed"
[13:28:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not AFAIK.
[13:28:53] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:29:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, seriously. A new constitution is about as deprecating as it gets :)
[13:29:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: does the Hungarian also offer the new solution before actually removing the old one? ;)

[13:31:19] <gseguin> uGoMobi: looking
[13:31:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No transition period there, I'm afraid :)
[13:31:54] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: looks good
[13:32:02] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Awesome! Thanks for looking!
[13:35:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so I added .removeClass( "ui-screen-hidden" ) to the creation of the span, and now it doesn't hide the selected option, even if it no longer appears in the list of options.
[13:36:24] <_|Nix|_> Do we agree that this fixes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6225?
[13:36:24] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6225 by RedWolves (2w 2d ago): Filter: Filtering a SELECT element causes unexpected experience
[13:36:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I totally agree
[13:38:04] * _|Nix|_ wipes his hands of #6225
[13:38:19] <_|Nix|_> Cool! It doesn't replace if it's a /me!
[13:38:43] <gseguin> uGoMobi: yeah adding it to the structure metadata should do it
[13:38:49] <gseguin> I'll give it a try
[13:39:26] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok thanks, I wasn't sure what the meta tage should look like
[13:40:09] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think there are more widgets that should point to multiple structure files
[13:40:29] <gseguin> like ?
[13:40:34] <uGoMobi> gseguin: because they need core CSS for the button styling
[13:40:44] <uGoMobi> listview for example
[13:40:57] <uGoMobi> actually all widgets that style an element as button
[13:41:09] <uGoMobi> they all need core.css
[13:41:41] <uGoMobi> we should move that button CSS to a seperate file
[13:41:55] <uGoMobi> you don't need all of core

[14:39:19] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5945 by gabrielschulhof (3mon 2w ago): Deprecate js/jquery.mobile.links.js
[14:39:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, link enhancement is deprecated?
[14:39:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, nice work on bug fixes! I agree we can do that post alpha
[14:39:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: As of 1.5.0, we leave links alone?
[14:39:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Add your own damn classes, people!
[14:39:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can say we deprecated ui-link
[14:40:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[14:40:06] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:40:25] <uGoMobi> yeah I already changed them to just apply styles to <a>
[14:40:33] <uGoMobi> s/them/theme/
[14:41:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I will add that to 1.4-changelog, and I will move the milestone to 1.5.0 so we actually remove the code.
[14:41:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, we can rename ticket to mention remove instead of deprecate
[14:42:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll do that too.
[14:42:30] <uGoMobi> thanks
[14:43:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will write short blog post tomorrow morning and work on upgrade guide
[14:43:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How does this sound: "Deprecated the application of class ui-link to anchors. The CSS now selects anchors directly."
[14:43:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if arschmitz is done too we can then release as soon as gseguin is around
[14:43:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome!
[14:43:42] <gseguin> I am
[14:43:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sounds perfect
