[05:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker_: I can't help but think that the DreamWeaver team is not comprised of people that have any idea about what's going on around them.
[05:11:17] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: like that fact that no one uses DreamWeaver? :P
[05:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: You should see the stupid questions we get from them.
[05:12:59] <kborchers> do they all start with MM_ ?
[05:13:20] <scott_gonzalez> They're integrating UI into DreamWeaver.
[05:13:24] <scott_gonzalez> About two weeks ago they asked if there is any sample code they can see for the menu.
[05:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[05:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> How are you integrating a project into your product and have no idea what's going on with that project?
[05:14:18] <scott_gonzalez> Today they ask "Is the Menu released? If not what is the ETA."
[05:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> How are they not able to figure this stuff out?
[05:14:39] <gnarf> um
[05:14:53] <gnarf> scary
[05:15:07] <scott_gonzalez> Right? As if we were working in a black hole.
[05:24:06] <kborchers> wow :/
[05:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: This was a long time ago, but do you know what focus issue you were trying to fix with this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/74a3f2c
[05:52:13] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i believe it had to do with once a link was clicked, the focus was on the anchor and not the menu so then keyboard interaction wasn't working … i think
[05:52:38] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[05:53:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's causing issues with autocomplete, because we're getting a focus event on the first element in the menu after clicking on any other element.
[05:55:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: really? focusing the menu causes a focus on the first item?
[05:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:56:48] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..it's different now thatn it was in the commit where this changed, but it's still doing it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js#L98
[05:57:38] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe because select doesn't set the active item? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js#L589
[05:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably set it if it's not set, right?
[05:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, right now we get different behavior for keybaord nav and mouse click.
[05:58:39] <kborchers> hmmm, but select calls collapseAll which blurs the menu which removes the active item
[05:58:45] <scott_gonzalez> Since keyboard nav will set the active item and click won't.
[05:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[05:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, but it does it on a delay.
[05:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> So the focus happens before the blur.
[06:00:28] <kborchers> ahh, yep
[06:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> So we need to prevent menu from triggering a focus event when we set focus on click.
[06:01:08] <kborchers> unless the click happens on a parent element of a submenu
[06:01:24] <kborchers> though, that probably doesn't matter
[06:01:30] <kborchers> since the focus is moved to the submenu
[06:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> Why is menu so complicated?
[06:02:12] <kborchers> makes it more fun
[06:02:14] <kborchers> :)
[06:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's like position. You think it's pretty straight-forward, but you're totally wrong.
[06:02:24] <kborchers> right
[06:03:07] <kborchers> i can mess with this tonight unless you're going to fix it now
[06:04:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: just let me know ^
[06:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look into it for a few minutes, but it might still be broken tonight ;-P
[06:06:02] <kborchers> ok :)
[06:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> There's a ticket for this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8552
[06:06:34] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, if you don't get it fixed can you assign that ticket to me?
[06:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[06:07:00] <kborchers> thanks, it'll help me remember to do it :)
[06:11:03] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I think the logic is busted for expand/focus anyway.
[06:11:22] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js#L81
[06:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't that be `target.has(...` ?
[06:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise the check is "Are there any submenus anyway?" Not "Does the clicked item have a submenu?"
[06:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> s/anyway/anywhere/
[06:12:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yep, you're right
[06:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, there are problems all over the place :-/
[06:25:44] <kborchers> ?
[06:29:03] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, this was just a one-off, I thought it'd be systemic.
[06:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> Hovering over a menu and pressing the right arrow was throwing an error.
[06:29:46] <scott_gonzalez> !this.active.is( ".ui-state-disabled" ) but this.active could be null.
[06:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> Every other place was doing a check though.
[06:29:58] <scott_gonzalez> So it was an easy fix.
[06:30:12] * kborchers sighs with relief
[06:30:49] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i was going to say i though i tested everything pretty well and others have run it through its paces quite a bit too
[06:31:10] <kborchers> glad it was just something small
[06:31:27] <kborchers> bot-t: make up your mind!
[06:31:33] <bot-t> kborchers, #11010 (Make Deferred.then == Deferred.pipe like Promise/A ... - Opened 9 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11010
[06:31:43] <kborchers> bot-t: thanks for nothing
[06:31:44] * bot-t sighs
[06:32:19] <scott_gonzalez> crap, tons of failing tests with my fix
[06:32:42] * kborchers hides
[06:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Does this seem reasonable? https://gist.github.com/e362a708c8901d704804
[06:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically the event.originalEvent test.
[06:34:36] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmm, why target.parent() … hasn't the event already bubbled to the menu-item at this point?
[06:34:58] <scott_gonzalez> Bubbling doesn't change the target.
[06:35:16] <kborchers> oh right. duh
[06:35:17] <kborchers> ok
[06:35:28] <kborchers> hmm, that seems reasonable then
[06:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> We can do target = $( event.target ).closest( ".ui-menu-item" ) though.
[06:35:41] <scott_gonzalez> Since that's what we're using the target for in the other check as well.
[06:35:47] <kborchers> yeah
[06:36:26] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/ab13440168fa832db8b8
[06:37:36] <kborchers> that seems good to me. are the tests still failing everywhere?
[06:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:37:45] <scott_gonzalez> This should be fun...
[06:37:55] <scott_gonzalez> My guess is a lot of tests were expecting the focus event.
[06:38:02] <kborchers> yep
[06:39:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: didn't actually look but if that's the case, i wonder if most of them could just be changed to the select event
[06:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I should've finished my review of the menu plugin :-P
[06:40:19] <kborchers> heh, i thought you had
[06:42:01] <scott_gonzalez> I only did about half of it.
[06:42:48] <kborchers> :/
[06:52:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: do you think you'll have time to finish your review today? i can work tonight so if you do and can put together a list of issues you find, i should be able to get to them later
[06:52:37] <kborchers> should probably happen before 1.9 final right?
[06:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'll try to do it today. I may need to do it to get these tests passing anyway...
[06:54:20] <scott_gonzalez> For example, should this test even exist? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/menu/menu_events.js#L46
[06:54:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's now failing because there's no blur occuring.
[06:54:57] <scott_gonzalez> There's no blur because there's no focus on the first item anymore.
[06:58:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmm, but shouldn't the blur happen in collapseAll ?
[06:58:31] <kborchers> if the item being clicked has a submenu it won't but if not, there should be a blur
[06:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> But it doesn't collapse.
[06:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> So that was a bug that was hidden by the focus problem?
[06:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> Or I guess it was behaving properly, but only because of other incorrect behavior.
[06:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> The focus forces a blur.
[06:59:50] <scott_gonzalez> Although, blur() doesn't call collapseAll().
[07:00:02] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: select does
[07:00:10] <kborchers> oh wait
[07:00:14] <kborchers> really?
[07:00:32] <kborchers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js#L108
[07:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> That's an actual blur event.
[07:02:01] <kborchers> oh, sorry you said blur()
[07:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, which is what would actually happen before.
[07:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> The click event would trigger a focus on the main element, which would call the focus() method, which would call the blur() method, which would trigger menufocus.
[07:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> s/menufocus/menublur/
[07:03:04] <scott_gonzalez> But now click triggers a focus on the main element and it just stops there.
[07:03:32] <kborchers> ahhh, i see. so it was the focus issue hiding it. making it look like it was working correctly
[07:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> right
[07:04:36] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: like i said, if you want to just make notes of what ever you find and leave it for me to do later i can. unless you need to fix things to get the tests running for your change
[07:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'll see where I can get with this. Right now the tests don't even run to completion.
[07:05:27] <kborchers> awesome
[07:12:56] <scott_gonzalez>  // Selecting a menu item removes the active item causing multiple clicks to be missing an item
[07:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> It sounds like we're hacking around the problem...
[07:13:52] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Is there any reasons select() shouldn't ALWAYS set this.active based on the event?
[07:14:20] <scott_gonzalez> Even if it's going to be reset right away from a collapse.
[07:16:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not that i can think of other than something else like autocomplete or selectmenu seeing that active item before the collapse happens
[07:16:32] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it should be the active item for that period, right?
[07:16:44] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, we're already using that for ui.item in the select event.
[07:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> Might as well keep the internal menu state consistent with what it's publicizing via events.
[07:18:12] <kborchers> makes sense, only other thing that comes to mind is if anything weird might happen when opening a submenu from click but i guess that's the same. it's active for a few milliseconds until the submenu opens and sets the first item there as active
[07:18:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that sounds fine.
[07:18:38] <scott_gonzalez> Making this change causes the blur event test to pass.
[07:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> Though my logging is confusing me. I'm seeing way more activity than I would expect.
[07:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> So I'll need to track that down.
[07:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Ok, so all this extra activity that I wasn't expecting is from the test, not the plugni.
[07:36:06] <kborchers> that's good
[07:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> I think the test shouldn't be using click.
[07:39:29] <scott_gonzalez> Since click will blur, and the test is manually bluring the element to check for the event.
[07:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> Although I'm not sure if a click should actually change which item is focused if you're on the first level of the menu.
[07:40:19] <scott_gonzalez> Obivously if the menu is in a popup, it doesn't matter.
[07:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose it doesn't really matter if it's inline either.
[07:41:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to think of where there are inline menus in OS X.
[07:41:23] <scott_gonzalez> It should probably keep focus on the clicked item.
[08:33:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: just noticed pushing a tag delete gives you a SHA of 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 :)
[08:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> makes sense
[08:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you deleting tags though?
[08:37:11] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: just wanted to repush it (same sha) to test something
[08:59:02] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: We have a few places where a template does nothing but call get_template_part().
[08:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> For example, menu-header.php in api.jqueryui.com is just `get_template_part('menu', 'header-ui');`
[08:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> We do that so api.jqueryui.com can do the same thing.
[08:59:57] <scott_gonzalez> But I find it kind of annoying that the templates are scattered like this.
[09:00:40] <scott_gonzalez> Is there any reason not to just put the actual template jqueryui.com/menu-header.php and then include() it from api.jqueryui.com/menu-header.php?
[09:45:48] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I've been meaning to go through all of the themes and dry them up a bit.

[10:48:04] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, Question. I dont know how it passed by before. But, on wiki we define the package by having"js/jquery-x.y.z.min.js". Although, we have no minified version of jquery.js on the build (only the not minified one).
[10:48:18] <rxaviers> Shall we update jquery-ui builder to place the minified there, so we can grab it in the package builder. Or shall we simply remove/ignore it?
[11:36:04] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I think I've mentioned this to scott_gonzalez once, I'm not sure what we came up with. We should either skip it in both places, or include them minified version in the ui repo, and then also in the package
[11:37:23] <rxaviers> Excelent. So, I will skip it in the package for now, since it's not included in ui. But, just let me know if we choose the other option.
