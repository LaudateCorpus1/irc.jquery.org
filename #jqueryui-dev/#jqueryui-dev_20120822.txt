[12:04:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: here now for a minute - sup
[12:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> I want to clean up some of the jQuery repos.
[12:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> Quick Skype call?
[12:05:45] <gnarf> sure
[12:38:37] <invisib> I'm trying to use jQueryUI datepicker on a text field in my form. It looks like I set it up right (as the calendar itself is displaying), but it's displaying before you click on the text input, and when you click on a date, the calendar doesn't disappear. Any ideas? http://mscns.webfactional.com/wattsbrothers/moving-quote/
[12:52:33] <scott_gonzalez> invisib: Ask in #jquery for support.
[12:52:38] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ping
[12:52:58] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: pong
[12:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> Is this garbage? https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-api
[12:54:37] <kswedberg> more or less. let's not get rid of it, though, until we move to the new site. so we have a fallback
[12:54:50] <kswedberg> or will we leave the current live site untouched?
[12:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, is this actually being used?
[12:55:34] <kswedberg> sort of. I mean, it's up to date. but I don't know if the site has ever actually been deployed from the repo.
[12:56:14] <kswedberg> I just kicked it old school and SFTPed the changes and then pushed them to github
[12:56:26] <kswedberg> (after testing things locally, of course)
[12:56:46] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I'm making backups of the repos I delete.
[12:56:55] <scott_gonzalez> I can leave this around until the new site launches if you want though.
[12:57:23] <kswedberg> I'd feel safer that way. but if you're making backups, then I guess it can't hurt.
[12:57:35] <kswedberg> I mean, it's not like you're deleting the plugins site or something. ;)
[12:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[12:58:24] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll just leave it for now.
[12:58:31] <kswedberg> btw, we haven't dealt with the single-file xml dump for the api site yet.
[12:59:02] <kswedberg> seems  that could be a fairly simple grunt task
[12:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah, that thing.
[12:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> That's just a matter of grabbing the <entry> node from each XML file, right?
[13:00:04] <kswedberg> yeah, and the category.xml file
[13:00:22] <kswedberg> yeah. the tricky thing, though, is the json(p) api
[13:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> We have a JSON API for our docs?!?
[13:01:46] <kswedberg> yeah, for like  2 years. http://www.learningjquery.com/2010/09/introducing-jquery-api-search
[13:02:13] <kswedberg> here's a demo
[13:02:43] <kswedberg> http://test.learningjquery.com/jqas
[13:17:33] <gnarf> hey scott_gonzalez https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/555
[13:18:01] <gnarf> I was getting ready to write a "need a unit test, also this section of code is scheduled for a complete overhaul"
[13:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's already on my list to look at before the RC.
[13:18:30] <scott_gonzalez> So, that rewrite is why it's been ignored.
[13:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> But it has a ton of +1s, which means lots of people have actually tested it.
[13:18:48] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm going to review it and hopefully land it.
[13:19:08] <gnarf> I'll try to update the people following the pull then
[13:19:15] <gnarf> perhaps test it myself
[13:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> ok, thanks
[13:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, I'm aiming to have the RC out this week.
