[04:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: You can see where we're storing data on disk here: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/mu-plugins/gw-xmlrpc.php#L7
[04:36:29] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: And the URLs should be domain.com/resouces/path/to/file.ext
[04:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> The gw_add_resource() method supports any level of directories, so files can be /resources/foo.jpg or /resources/foo/bar/baz.jpg
[04:38:02] <scott_gonzalez> The redirect should be easy to setup, but I wonder how complicated local dev will get if we need to install nginx and keep those configs in sync as well.

[06:12:04] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tabs: Rename internal properties. - Scott González
[06:17:22] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: We can also set up the redirect in WordPress as a fallback, to assist in local dev.
[06:17:49] <nacin> Either via htaccess or internal rules.
[06:18:13] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: That'd be great.
[06:18:36] <nacin> I am dealing with explosions this morning but should be done in the next few hours.
[06:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:21:11] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #512: SUCCESS in 8 min 59 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/512/
[06:21:11] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Tabs: Rename internal properties.
[06:48:10] <scott_gonzalez> What should we do in the case of .tabs({ disabled: true, active: 1 }) ?
[06:48:35] <scott_gonzalez> To make that more explicit: .tabs({ disabled: true, active: 1, collapsible: false })
[06:48:39] <scott_gonzalez> It's an invalid state to be in.
[06:55:24] <rworth> We could have an active method that returns the normalized value
[06:55:38] <rworth> and the options remain in inconsistent states. This is how slider works
[06:56:24] <scott_gonzalez> What's the equivalent in slider?
[06:56:38] <rworth> value being outside min and max
[06:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> We should not be introducing an active method in tabs.
[06:56:47] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: That's invalid and should be fixed.
[06:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> Value cannot go below min or above max.
[06:57:24] <rworth> except we don't know in which order options will be set
[06:57:44] <rworth> so we allow for the option to have a value that normalized by another option
[06:57:50] <rworth> otherwise you lose data
[06:57:51] <scott_gonzalez> So? Either do it in a single call or you're bound by the order.
[06:58:25] <rworth> I don't think we had a way of doing it in a single call at the time ;)
[06:58:35] <scott_gonzalez> We did, it just wasn't generalized.
[06:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you mean .option({}) wasn't supported?
[06:59:09] <rworth> yeah
[07:00:02] <scott_gonzalez> ew gross, just looked at 1.5.1

[07:42:25] <jzaefferer> look at that, success in 8 minutes
[07:42:39] <jzaefferer> awesomesauce! ^^^ Krinkle scott_gonzalez gnarf kborchers
[07:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:42:54] <kborchers> \o/
[07:43:00] <Krinkle> Nice
[07:43:13] <Krinkle> Did you cheat?
[07:43:25] <jzaefferer> wasn't the first
[07:43:30] <Krinkle> aha
[07:43:31] <Krinkle> interesting
[07:43:35] <Krinkle> Oh, jquery UI
[07:43:45] <Krinkle> that's been going pretty for a little while
[07:44:01] <jzaefferer> the last four were <10mins
[07:44:19] <Krinkle> Minor set back last weekend due to a bug in FF11/F12 but other than that, being going all-green for a few weeks
[07:44:37] <Krinkle> but yeah, it was still red in Jenkins due to the slownes
[07:50:12] <scott_gonzalez> First Touch Events WG call since March is coming up in 10 minutes :-)

[07:57:41] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Tabs: Removed TODO about making .load() accept nodes; it's unnecessary.
[07:58:20] <scott_gonzalez> That TODO was the key to a fast build, apparently.
[07:58:36] <Krinkle> hehe
[07:59:19] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: You found the one line that made it go 5 minutes faster, and then you decided to remove it
[07:59:20] <Krinkle> well done :P
[07:59:47] <scott_gonzalez> I just thought things were starting to look too good around here :-P
[09:54:03] <scott_gonzalez> Justin_o: Thanks for verifying the Orca fix.
[09:54:13] <scott_gonzalez> You said this affects accordion as well, correct?
[09:54:51] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: no problem, and yes it did affect accordion too. I tried the instance of the accordion that i was using and it worked as well
[09:55:09] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks. I've got this noted on our dev wiki.
[09:55:40] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: great thanks
