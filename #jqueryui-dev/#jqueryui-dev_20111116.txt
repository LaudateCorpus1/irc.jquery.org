[09:08:01] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Spinner: Handle changes to numberFormat and currency options. - Scott González
[09:08:51] <jzaefferer> that's a pretty misleading commit message
[09:09:12] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[09:16:03] <jzaefferer> there is no currency option, should've been "numberFormat and culture options"
[09:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, yes, that's what I meant
[09:21:51] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: will you not be around for the sprint tomorrw?
[09:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be around until 2:00p
[09:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> couldn't find a later flight unless I got in at midnight

[09:43:37] <jzaefferer> another train child, forgot to push that...
[10:30:07] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: still around?
[10:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:30:45] <Dave_Stein> if ui 2.0 is gonna have breaking changes why can't we start off with latest jquery since users will need to refactor one way or another? i'm not gonna argue it, just curious
[10:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> we're doing our best not to break stuff
[10:31:37] <Dave_Stein> fair enough :)
[10:31:40] <scott_gonzalez> and upgrading jQuery isn't always easy
[10:31:57] <Dave_Stein> also i know you wanted me to stay away from ui position when doing the new widgets
[10:32:21] <Dave_Stein> kris was telling me it has some useful stuff that would be beneficial for my draggable when it came to a relative draggalbe inside a relative div
[10:32:41] <Dave_Stein> should i use ui position for now to swap out later or just pull out the bits that are useful there
[10:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> what would be useful?
[10:33:20] <Dave_Stein> i didn't take a close look but he was telling me it would allow me to say the container to go from amongst other things.
[10:33:28] <Dave_Stein> basically that line in draggable where its calculating via css
[10:33:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not aware of positioning issues with relative elements inside relative elements
[10:33:41] <Dave_Stein> shuold be swapped out for "something" and he was suggesting ui position would help me with that
[10:33:52] <Dave_Stein> okay let me type out the example im having issue with
[10:34:23] <Dave_Stein> so we said on the phone originall i should remove the css calculations so we can have less lines and one way to determine position. so i went back to figure what math i can use with just offset() and position().
[10:34:45] <Dave_Stein> the problem I found was if my draggable is in a relative div with 100px padding, and then my draggable startsr with inline style of 10px
[10:35:09] <Dave_Stein> there's no math for me to properly gather that the inline style should change to 11px on my first drag when there is a 1px diff
[10:35:19] <Dave_Stein> and then 12px when there is a 1px diff on second drag
[10:35:43] <scott_gonzalez> isn't it just .position().left + 1?
[10:35:45] <Dave_Stein> without keeping a flag or some other bit of data, which at that point is more cmoplicated than using the css as i am now
[10:35:47] <Dave_Stein> no
[10:35:55] <scott_gonzalez> where 1 = the diff in event props
[10:36:11] <Dave_Stein> right thats the bug on second drag with that thinking using only math
[10:36:16] <Dave_Stein> cause if i cache 10 as the start point
[10:36:21] <Dave_Stein> for fixed or absolute
[10:36:46] <Dave_Stein> i can use the x difference straight all the time
[10:36:59] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand why you can't
[10:37:41] <Dave_Stein> hold on let me bring my up my code so i can say why better
[10:37:44] <Dave_Stein> i know there was a good reason :)
[10:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> heh, ok
[10:38:46] <Dave_Stein> i hate how the whole thing highlights in github but only the text is the link
[10:38:52] <Dave_Stein> when switching branches
[10:40:27] <Dave_Stein> okay so i set the starting positions when the mouse goes down. if im using fixed or absolute i can ignore the current CSS value all the time since its in relation to document ( although now i think i have a bug with an sboslute draggable in relative div i gotta look at )
[10:41:29] <Dave_Stein> and the way you suggested i realized would work if i was looking soley at the css for relative, which is whati m doing now and is working
[10:41:50] <scott_gonzalez> it should work if you look solely at .position() too
[10:41:59] <scott_gonzalez> and then it should work everywhere
[10:42:10] <Dave_Stein> no cause position().left can give me a value of 100px
[10:42:15] <Dave_Stein> when it needs to be 10px
[10:43:19] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/uvnJU/
[10:43:34] <Dave_Stein> so when user has an x change of 1 i need to know 11px, not 101px
[10:44:04] <Dave_Stein> and kris was telling me ui position handles shit like that
[10:44:18] <Dave_Stein> althoguh i havent taken a close look yet, i just went off to droppable before talkin to you
[10:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> well, UI position relies on .offset() to do that
[10:45:22] <Dave_Stein> which isn't as good cause offset() is much slower, right
[10:45:39] <Dave_Stein> i know i have another bit to refactor where i'm calling it too much and i think i can use calculations instead of it there, when user is overriding stuff
[10:46:44] <Dave_Stein> oh whoops i gotcha youre saying i should be able to do the same without ui position since they are using math which relies on offset which i do call once on drag start anyway
[10:47:33] <Dave_Stein> but i feel like my css approach which is a few more lines is a lot more simple than all the extra math and calculating if there parents are relative or not, which is actually looking at css in the end anyway
[10:47:48] <Dave_Stein> to know if the parent is relative
[10:47:52] <Dave_Stein> or any parents at all for that matter
[10:48:08] <scott_gonzalez> it's not even necessarily the parent
[10:48:17] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[10:48:53] <Dave_Stein> so to properly do the math id need to know about the parents, which one is relative, and what its offset is
[10:49:13] <Dave_Stein> whereas with the css else i have for relative, its just a few simple lines
[10:49:54] <Dave_Stein> so in the end, what is the exact issue with my minor split for relative in the function _getPosition
[10:51:25] <scott_gonzalez> it sounds like nothing
[10:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> just need to document why
[10:51:47] <Dave_Stein> okay cool ill doc why then
[10:51:55] <Dave_Stein> cause in our initial phone call you had asked if i should switch it up
[10:52:05] <Dave_Stein> rather i should and do it if i can
[10:52:15] <Dave_Stein> but it sounds like its not as much of an issue anymore
[10:52:24] <Dave_Stein> after trying and figuring out why :)
[10:52:31] <scott_gonzalez> because we didn't understand why it had to be different
[10:52:38] <Dave_Stein> yeah and i honestly forgot at the time
[10:52:43] <scott_gonzalez> but the example you just gave explains why
[10:52:48] <Dave_Stein> yup
[10:52:49] <Dave_Stein> cool
[10:53:14] <Dave_Stein> im not very good at explaining things in general. every year im told to work on it. one day ill get better
[10:53:18] <Dave_Stein> at least i can make things work haha
[10:53:26] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:54:03] <Dave_Stein> when you get a chance to review droppable let me know
[10:54:31] <Dave_Stein> im trying to avoid ddmanager still so i have these screwy lines of $('*').live( 'drag' ) that i wanted to switch for $.Callbacks
[10:55:16] <Dave_Stein> so maybe UI can have a mini thing similar to backbone where its just bind and trigger for non-dom events. its like 15 lines. then id be able to have a draggable fire an event that its dragging, not to a specific element
[10:55:21] <Dave_Stein> and each droppable can listen for that event
[10:55:27] <scott_gonzalez> that can just be this._bind( this.doc, { drag: ... } )
[10:55:41] <Dave_Stein> ok
[10:55:56] <Dave_Stein> does that work because of ._trigger specficailly?
[10:56:00] <Dave_Stein> *specficailly
[10:56:19] <scott_gonzalez> no, it works because events bubble
[10:56:25] <Dave_Stein> like does all ._trigger fire on the element and the doc? or does trigger usually fire.... was about to say cause of bubble
[10:56:44] <Dave_Stein> i never had the need to capture at the top for something i fired on an element
[10:56:54] <Dave_Stein> so didnt know if jquery prevented bubbling that way but obviously not
[10:57:20] <Dave_Stein> cool wel when i make that change droppable is pretty "done" aside from more options work so yeah ill swap out for ._bind and let me know any feedback for that plugin or sortable to start
[10:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> cool, I should be able to get to it in a few days
[10:59:17] <Dave_Stein> excellent
[10:59:24] <Dave_Stein> back to work then
[10:59:35] <Dave_Stein> ttyl
[13:21:04] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, I've talked to clarkbox (he's in here now, too!), we should get together with him on Skype one of these days and figure out where else he can help
[13:21:22] <clarkbox> wurd
[13:21:33] <jzaefferer> as frontend architekt for http://www.splunk.com/ - there's probably much more we could collaborate on
[16:23:04] <gnarf> kborchers: you around?
[16:58:18] <kborchers> gnarf: yo
[17:04:45] <gnarf> kborchers: im working on a position flip/fit solution
[17:04:53] <gnarf> for my own little project
[17:04:57] * kborchers hides
[17:05:00] * gnarf grins
[17:05:01] <kborchers> ;)
[17:06:36] <kborchers> looking at -dev
[17:06:47] <kborchers> you're looking for offset() without jquery?
[17:07:49] <gnarf> partially
[17:07:57] <gnarf> also window dimensions
[17:08:01] <gnarf> and top/left
[17:08:21] <gnarf> im not so concerned about the edge cases right now
[17:08:28] <gnarf> just tyring to get it working in the majors
[17:09:31] <kborchers> honestly ... i think Dave might get you close to some of that https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js#L79
