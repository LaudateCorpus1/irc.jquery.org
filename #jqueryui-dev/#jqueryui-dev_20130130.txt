[02:57:02] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, in firefox, http://jquery.com/ footer is white to me...
[02:58:09] <rxaviers> removing background-repeat style of .multiplebgs.cssgradients footer line 2451 on base.css seems to fix it.
[02:59:50] <agcolom> rxaviers: hi :-) I'm on FF but I get the grey background... I'm on an old OS though
[03:00:31] <rxaviers> interesting.. Im using 15.0
[03:00:34] <rxaviers> let me check on browserstack
[03:01:02] <agcolom> i'm on FF16
[03:03:42] <rxaviers> On browserstack, it fails on all ff's on win7. It works  on IE9 win7 though.
[03:03:53] <rxaviers> on mac, it works
[03:03:56] <rxaviers> Im on linux, fails
[03:04:36] <rxaviers> Pardom, on mac it fails too.. Safari passes
[03:05:04] <rxaviers> ff 16beta on mac passes too
[03:07:02] <agcolom> yes, I'm on a MAc...

[05:22:09] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9028 is about sortable not draggable
[05:23:03] <tj_vantoll> whoops
[05:24:04] <tj_vantoll> I'll update that with a new fiddle.
[05:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> Any objections to closing this as wontfix? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8389
[05:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> We'd need to position with bottom instead of top.
[05:24:52] <scott_gonzalez> I really don't want to make positiong even more complicated.
[05:25:00] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.7.x core build #196: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.7.x%20core/196/
[05:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> Could close as patcheswelcome.
[05:25:18] <scott_gonzalez> But it'd require making .position() even smarter.
[05:25:23] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I like that.  It seems like such a minor problem.
[05:25:36] <tj_vantoll> It's probably an "issue" with other widgets.
[05:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:26:16] <tj_vantoll> You could implement it on top of position without too much work too.
[05:26:33] <tj_vantoll> if (I was flipped) { change the animation }
[05:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> It's not even changing the animation.
[05:27:07] <scott_gonzalez> You still want to use slideDown().
[05:27:23] <scott_gonzalez> And it's not even about flipping ;-)
[05:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> The logic would have to be, if I'm positioned above my target, use botom. If I'm positioned below, use top.
[05:27:54] <scott_gonzalez> And same logic for left/right.
[05:28:36] <tj_vantoll> So the same animation but it would have to be smarter?
[05:28:47] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[05:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> Same animation, just the positioning needs to be smarter.
[05:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, thinking abou this some more, it's probably not that much code.
[05:29:36] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm sure it would wreak havoc of a lot of code if we started using bottom/right in some cases with .position().
[05:30:33] <tj_vantoll> It's such an edge case that I don't really think it's worth our time unless it truly is trivial.

[05:37:34] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Sorry I'm apparently on autopilot today
[05:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:02:34] <gnarf> xhrm scott_gonzalez
[06:02:38] <gnarf> question
[06:03:06] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L189
[06:03:26] <gnarf> why is that stoping my "return this" from returning the instance, it returns the jQuery instead ;)
[06:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, it's for chaining on the instance.
[06:04:04] <scott_gonzalez> instance.foo().bar()
[06:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> .foo() would have to `return this`
[06:05:29] <gnarf> yeah
[06:05:36] <gnarf> makes sense for an undefined
[06:05:43] <gnarf> but i guess return this from the method makes sense
[06:05:47] <gnarf> to return the jQuery
[06:06:20] <gnarf> but I'm trying to implement that "instance" method
[06:06:34] <gnarf> and without doing a specific check for "instance" in bridge, i don't think I can do this
[06:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's have to be whitelisted in that check.
[06:07:04] <gnarf> i could just implement it in the bridge
[06:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> We could opt to make the instance method part of the bridge.
[06:07:20] <gnarf> if ( options === "instance" ) { returnValue = instance; return false; }
[06:08:15] <scott_gonzalez> yeah

[06:16:30] <scott_gonzalez> looks good
[06:16:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'll have to wait for 1.11.
[06:32:59] <gnarf> oh shit
[06:33:05] <gnarf> oh wait
[06:33:05] <gnarf> nvm
[06:33:12] <gnarf> i thought i just pushed to master
[06:33:14] <gnarf> lol
[06:33:38] <gnarf> typed "git push" without args, and it was pushing to gnarf37 luckilly
[06:34:11] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i added two commits to it - one to make the demos use it, and one to make the other widgets use it

[06:38:27] <djQuery> having some issues implimenting addClass to overlay 
[06:38:54] <djQuery> it works if you set the option on init but having trouble accessing the overlay in setOption
[06:39:18] <djQuery> gnarf, any suggestions
[06:39:51] <gnarf> djQuery: got a fiddle/gist/etc to look at?
[06:40:09] <gnarf> dialog overlay, yes?
[06:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: Please don't work on that ticket.
[06:40:59] <scott_gonzalez> It will be handled by http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7053
[06:42:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: glad you hadn't left yet ;)
[06:43:44] <djQuery> thats gonna be some big change, looks cool
[06:44:10] <djQuery> so how do I delete a checkout now?
[06:44:12] <djQuery> lol
[06:57:32] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #943: STILL FAILING in 46 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/943/

[07:01:34] <kborchers> gnarf: that instance method just makes so much sense
[07:01:57] <gnarf> kborchers: thought about it after I saw scott's commit for the autocomplete demos
[07:02:08] <gnarf> figured it would be safest to switch to something like that
[07:02:14] <gnarf> in case we decide to change where it's stored again
[07:02:19] <kborchers> ah, yeah
[07:04:40] <djQuery> ok sinc eht elast one that I was fixin doesnt need to be fixed... I thought I would hit the performance issue with ui.button
[07:04:47] <djQuery> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5454
[07:08:58] <gnarf> I think that one requires some discussion from scott_gonzalez etc, perhaps a good tick to talk about in the meeting today
[07:09:15] <djQuery> when and where is the meeting
[07:09:41] <gnarf> #jquery-meeting, 2 hrs
[07:09:49] <gnarf> http://jquery.org/meeting
[07:09:58] <gnarf> has the calendar of events
[07:11:11] <djQuery> added to google
[07:12:26] <djQuery> dang datepicker could be someones full time job with all the tickets it gets
[07:14:19] <gnarf> it needs a full rewrite
[07:14:25] <gnarf> which is why most of those tickets are still open
[07:14:42] <gnarf> there are a few others that are basically on our "don't fix" list right now
[07:14:45] <gnarf> because they wait for rewrites
[07:14:54] <gnarf> putting too much effort in fixing the bug is kinda pointless
[07:19:44] <djQuery> http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js    is returning a 503 service unavailable error?
[07:21:27] <gnarf> djQuery: not for me...
[07:21:33] <petersendidit> djQuery: not for me
[07:21:39] <tj_vantoll> djQuery: not for me
[07:22:25] <djQuery> well its working for me too now
[07:26:00] <djQuery> would it be faster to just grab all the $('label')  then apply the .filter('[for="input.id"])
[07:26:23] <djQuery> ^^ not exact code
[07:26:40] <djQuery> I always have to look up the attribute syntax as I dont use it much
[07:26:41] <gnarf> potentially
[07:27:05] <gnarf> it would probably be even easier to .filter( function() { return this.for === input.id } );
[07:27:11] <gnarf> but 
[07:27:13] <gnarf> who knows
[07:27:36] <djQuery> 2000 buttons 5 seconds http://jsbin.com/etawoy/14/edit
[07:28:33] <gnarf> you could feed some tests into jsperf
[07:36:10] <djQuery> http://jsperf.com/jquery-button-performans-issues
[07:37:00] <djQuery> hmmm didn't expect that 
[07:37:21] <djQuery> buttonset is significantly faster than button
[07:41:40] <djQuery> this issue seems allready fixed http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8958
[07:42:08] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/igixuv/2/edit
[07:46:08] <gnarf> cc tj_vantoll ^^^^
[07:48:04] <tj_vantoll> djQuery I'm still seeing it here http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/Gey9L/
[07:51:03] <djQuery> tj_vantoll, k, will look at it more don't see why this doesn't exhibit the same behavior  http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Gey9L/1/
[07:51:28] <djQuery> all your doing is causing the blur to happend which triggers a double open
[07:51:39] <djQuery> odd
[07:52:48] <gnarf> because it opens while opening
[07:53:11] <gnarf> the blur event is called while "open" is running, so the second call to "open" opens it again
[07:53:23] <gnarf> and then the original open call finishes
[07:54:56] <gnarf> it's not like a serial call of two opens
[07:55:24] <djQuery> k I see the timing, still dont know how to fix it
[07:55:31] <djQuery> keep digging
[07:56:59] <djQuery> gnarf, tj_vantoll so all I realy need to do is put a check in _createOverlay to verify that this.overlay is null
[07:57:36] <djQuery> if(this.overlay !== null){return;}
[07:58:07] <djQuery> well will give it a test
[07:58:56] <tj_vantoll> Haven't dug into it much, but that seems reasonable.
[07:59:29] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/4b97b1d40363792cf470 works too
[08:04:06] <djQuery> tj_vantoll, http://jsbin.com/igixuv/3/edit
[08:04:35] <gnarf> even like a https://gist.github.com/be0755e36b50d80fe142 djQuery
[08:05:12] <djQuery> gnarf, your first one is better
[08:05:33] <djQuery> lets not go through the whole opening process 
[08:06:42] <djQuery> you gonna PR that or you want me to
[08:06:54] <djQuery> gnarf ^^
[08:07:07] <gnarf> djQuery: it needs tests either way
[08:07:13] <gnarf> which is kinda difficult to do
[08:07:40] <gnarf> but yeah, i would think skipping the whole opening process while processing an open is safest
[08:07:46] <djQuery> gnarf, think I have the testing my head allready
[08:08:21] <djQuery> testing in my head

[09:36:22] <[fields]> I'm attempting to utilize jQueryUI tabs.  I am testing this in Firefox,Chrome,IE9,Safari & Safari for iPad.  There seems to be an icon for each tab nav item that I didn't intend on being there.  I do not see this icon on the theme-roller.  Does anyone know how to easily remove these tab nav item icons?
[09:36:55] <gnarf> [fields]: support in #jquery - and someone will want you to show a demo - see ?demo 
[09:36:56] <bot-t> [fields], Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:36:57] <gnarf> :)
[09:38:23] <[fields]> hmm... a screenshot is easiest on me, but not the same
[09:42:10] <gnarf> [fields]: either way - #jquery is the channel
[09:43:16] <[fields]> thanks.  I think I may have just discovered my issue.  Another css file is likely setting a custom icon to all ul elements.  And thats what I'm seeing in the tab nav items that look like ui-icon
[09:56:38] <djQuery> any idea why .buttonset would be so much faster than .button   I would have thought it would be slower

[10:18:12] <scott_gonzalez> I just copied the setup script into a standalone page.
[10:19:54] <djQuery> yeah I would have thought that buttonset would take longer don't know what I did wrong in the test
[10:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> Me neither, it looks correct.
[10:20:13] <djQuery> bet its not running the cleanup correctly before running the 2nd test
[10:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> Also strange that I get such differnet results using the exact same code, just outside of jsperf.
[10:20:59] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: Try switching the order they run in.

[11:26:41] <gnarf> djQuery: the demo code is inside the jquery-ui repo
[11:28:01] <djQuery> gnarf, gues the first thing to do is see if its broken in http://stage.jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists-through-tabs
[11:28:04] <djQuery> which it is
[11:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that demo needs to not use old and busted APIs.
[11:43:48] <gnarf> killing download builder for like a minute to test stuff
[11:43:50] <gnarf> it'll be back
[12:08:59] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, with gnarf help we figured out the issues with new images performance on prod env. Node.js download builder load is very intense and is competing CPU with it. That's why.
[12:09:46] <rxaviers> Sniff checking log, it seems we have a high traffic from TR (generating individual themes for every minor user change)
[12:10:17] <rxaviers> I will analyze it better (perhaps with splunk help) and let you know.
[12:11:32] <rxaviers> We'll probably need to address that first
[12:59:26] <djQuery> see any issues with this test? https://gist.github.com/b690d77ec92dc039a3e9
[13:00:16] <djQuery> don't know how to roll back commits yet and wanted to get an opinion on this faster
[13:00:30] <djQuery> so no diff just copied the changed portions
[13:08:21] <tj_vantoll> djQuery Does the blur actually fire in that test?  I would think that you would have to give it focus.
[13:17:45] <djQuery> tj_vantoll, most likely but I am getting errors in dialog_event.js when I havent even modified it
[13:18:39] <djQuery> dialog: events: global failure 
[13:19:17] <djQuery> did someone commit a bad test
[13:20:34] <djQuery> oh and I never see my tests run
[13:28:01] <tj_vantoll> I just pulled master and the tests ran fine with grunt.
[13:29:36] <djQuery> tj_vantoll, my portion is running fine now
[13:30:48] <djQuery> tj_vantoll, guess I will add another test before opening the dialog to verify that the input has focus
[13:32:31] <tj_vantoll> Well it has to have focus and then lose focus for the blur to fire.  Does the test fail before your patch to dialog.js is applied?
[13:37:17] <djQuery> tj_vantoll, will comment out my changes real quick;
[13:40:57] <djQuery> tj_vantoll, darn it still passess the tests even after commenting out my changes
[14:14:35] <gnarf> does dialog have an open callback?
[14:15:06] <gnarf> darn
[14:15:10] <gnarf> happens too late in that
[14:15:25] <gnarf> yeah, the only good test case is going to be losing focus on something
[14:16:10] <gnarf> djQuery: you should increase the expect count and add an ok( true, "Input lost focus while dialog opened" );
[14:16:30] <gnarf> also, new tests should use var element = instead of el =
[14:16:56] <gnarf> djQuery: just add .focus() to line 9
[14:17:08] <gnarf> also
[14:41:27] <djQuery> gnarf, "element" not familiar yet was copying what was allready in file
[14:41:44] <djQuery> allready added .focus to no effect
[14:43:36] <djQuery> are you saying to put the ok( true, 'Input lost focus'); inside the focus function?
[14:45:58] <djQuery> gnarf, I added this after line 9 equal(document.activeElement, i[0], "input has focus")
[14:50:07] <gnarf> djQuery: basically, there is no reason to use variable names that aren't nice and descriptive :)
[14:50:23] <djQuery> allready renamed them
[14:50:58] <djQuery> working on the test that is the oposite of  equal(document.activeElement, i[0], "input has focus")
[15:04:02] <djQuery> even after reverting to unedited dialog.js I cant get this test to fail
[15:04:03] <djQuery> equal( $( ".ui-widget-overlay" ).length, 1, "only 1 overlay was created");
[15:04:20] <djQuery> gnarf, ^^^^
[15:12:08] <djQuery> off to work
[18:23:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ask and you shall receive :-)
[18:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[18:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> In that case, I ask for this cold to go away so I don't feel like shit anymore.
[18:24:29] <kborchers> heh
[18:24:41] <kborchers> where the heck is doesallmagic ?
[18:24:49] <kborchers> lazy bot!
[18:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe he's trapped in a .box()!
[18:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> He could also be hanging out on the main level.
[18:29:10] <DaveMethvin> um, guys
[18:29:18] <DaveMethvin> browserstack seems to be dead again
[18:29:39] <DaveMethvin> Fatal error: Unexpected token <
[18:29:53] <kborchers> uh oh
[18:30:04] <DaveMethvin> doesn't ANYTHING work around here?
[18:30:15] <DaveMethvin> i mean, except for my code
[18:30:33] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: you need break bud

[18:33:15] <doesallmagic> kris.borchers: Dialog: Move call to _focusTabbable and triggering of open and focus events into the _show callback. Fixes #6756 - Dialog: show: "blind" with link in content doesn't animate properly. Fixes #8051 - Dialog: 'Explode' dialog animation causes crash in IE 6, 7 and 8. Fixes #4421 - Dialog: Focus lost from dialog which uses show-effect
[18:33:32] <kborchers> about time!
[18:33:47] <DaveMethvin> you died on phantomjs
[18:33:59] <kborchers> o_O
[18:34:11] <kborchers> probably because it wasn't your code DaveMethvin 
[18:34:41] <DaveMethvin> my code failures are spectacular!
[18:35:18] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: but how ofter do you kill phantomjs?
[18:35:34] <DaveMethvin> it's a PHANTOM for gosh sakes
[18:35:36] <DaveMethvin> it's already dead
[18:35:40] <kborchers> LOL
[18:39:22] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, DaveMethvin, I should mention that I plan on looking into the shadow root problem.
[18:39:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's been on my todo list for a few months now :-/
[18:39:57] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to see it get fleshed out more
[18:40:03] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[18:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> My plan is to build a few of the UI widgets as web components.
[18:40:31] <DaveMethvin> since a shadow root is a doc fragment, and since we already have a queasy relationship with doc fragments, i wonder how well they will live inside a jquery set
[18:40:47] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at the semantics in much detail
[18:40:57] <DaveMethvin> i like the general idea tho
