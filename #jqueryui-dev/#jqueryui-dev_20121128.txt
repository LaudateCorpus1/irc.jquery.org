[01:40:39] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, hi Jorn
[01:41:53] <rxaviers> where does this example `$( ".selector" ).dialog( "option", ...` in http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/ come from? Is it from api.jqueryui.com? I didnt find it
[01:53:40] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the content repo (api.jqueryui.com) contains just the sample value, the example is then generated by grunt-jquery-content
[01:54:16] <rxaviers> ah ok thks
[01:54:40] <rxaviers> On dialog, there is an example that could follow coding standards. I will open a PR

[02:03:59] <_|Nix|_> Hey! We got this bug https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5249 where our nav stops working if a JS error occurs in the handling of a certain event. We do a ._trigger( "show" ) and then we unset a flag which enables future functioning. So, if an unhandled exception occurs during the event handling, we never unset that flag.
[02:04:29] <_|Nix|_> Now, as frameworks, we know that handlers attached to events we trigger might end up causing unhandled exceptions.
[02:04:45] <_|Nix|_> So, shouldn't we wrap our _trigger calls in try {} blocks?
[02:05:15] <_|Nix|_> I mean, I might even go so far as to say that core should do it, but I figured I'd stop by UI first :)
[02:05:20] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: we don't do that anywhere in jQuery UI
[02:05:47] <jzaefferer> considering how much JS sucks in rethrowing exceptions, having a framework catch one is usually a bad idea
[02:06:14] <_|Nix|_> Aha ... OK ...
[02:06:39] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: My other approach to that bug is to say - well, fix your code and it won't happen anymore.
[02:07:09] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: What you just said confirms that the other approach is probably a good idea.
[02:07:11] <jzaefferer> yeah, you should close that as wontfix
[02:07:40] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Thanks!
[02:07:46] <jzaefferer> you can mention that frameworks catching exceptions would mean that its nearly impossible to track down the actual issue, as you loose the original stacktrace
[02:09:29] <_|Nix|_> Good idea.
[02:14:09] <_|Nix|_> In a related note, I did find a try block around a trigger inside the widget factory: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/f2854408cce7e4b7fc6bf8676761904af9c96bde/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L18 ... I wonder if it's safe to remove though, after reading the associated bug report. Maybe they have since fixed the cause in core.
[02:30:32] <jzaefferer> good point
[02:31:40] <jzaefferer> I wonder in which version that landed

[07:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> There was discussion of triggering actual events which gives you for special error handling.
[07:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/selectmenu/entries2html.xsl is what loads jQuery UI.
[07:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: That free-aria discussion is so frustrating.

[07:49:14] <mikesherov> rworth, simulate only lives in jquery-ui master as it's latest state?
[07:51:41] <gnarf> mikesherov: confirm - i believe that is just something we wrote as a test helper.  at least we haven't updated any upstream
[07:52:04] <mikesherov> well, there is one in rworth on github
[07:52:12] <mikesherov> We should make it an official thing
[07:52:23] <mikesherov> especially because there's a lot to improve
[07:52:31] <mikesherov> and we can be using issues to track
[07:52:38] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: ^
[07:52:43] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[07:52:54] <gnarf> toddmparker: ^
[07:53:03] <mikesherov> everyone ^
[07:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Didn't we already talk about this?
[07:53:14] <mikesherov> Oh, I don't remember
[07:53:26] <mikesherov> I have so many convos each day and my memory is bad
[07:53:27] <scott_gonzalez> We agreed to move it to its own repo and pull it in to UI like we do with color.
[07:53:32] <mikesherov> Oh, great
[07:53:42] <scott_gonzalez> Because you didn't want to track the TODOs in the code.
[07:53:45] <scott_gonzalez> You wanted to use issues.
[07:53:46] <mikesherov> HA
[07:53:51] <mikesherov> At least I'm consistent
[07:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:54:03] <mikesherov> gnard: can we set that up?
[07:54:09] <mikesherov> jquery/jquery.simulate.js
[07:54:18] <mikesherov> gnarf: LOL
[07:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-simulate would be more consistent with other repos.
[07:54:28] <gnarf> jquery-simulate
[07:54:29] <DaveMethvin> you rang mikesherov?
[07:54:29] <gnarf> ...
[07:54:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez:  :)
[07:54:35] <mikesherov> nvm DaveMethvin we got this
[07:54:36] <DaveMethvin> simulate?
[07:54:40] <mikesherov> I just like pinging you
[07:54:48] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: that event triggering helper we have in UI tests
[07:54:51] <mikesherov> jquery.simulate.js is a useful simulation library
[07:55:03] <mikesherov> it's a natural complement to QUnit
[07:55:05] <gnarf> mikesherov: maybe we could add sinon-like stuff for timers too
[07:55:12] * gnarf shrugs
[07:55:14] <DaveMethvin> agreed, we could use it ourselves
[07:55:16] <DaveMethvin> in core
[07:55:25] <scott_gonzalez> We should look at syn.js
[07:55:25] <mikesherov> ok, so new repo!
[07:55:28] <mikesherov> Holla
[07:55:40] <DaveMethvin> jquery-simulate would be a good name for hte repo
[07:55:45] <gnarf> ill do it
[07:56:06] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: syn.js looks awesome
[07:56:08] <gnarf> does it need its own "team" or should I just add UI for now?
[07:56:27] <mikesherov> UI for now shoudl work, I can't imagine anyone other than me or scott_gonzalez anyway
[07:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Should we hold off on moving it while we look at syn.js?
[07:57:15] * gnarf waits
[07:57:41] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: sure, that's fine.
[07:58:03] <mikesherov> I can whip up a branch with syn.js instead of simulate
[07:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, fail: http://v3.javascriptmvc.com/funcunit/dist/scripts/syn.js
[07:59:21] <mikesherov> um, it looks dead
[07:59:24] <scott_gonzalez> found it: https://github.com/bitovi/syn
[07:59:33] <scott_gonzalez> last commit was 15 days ago.
[07:59:54] <mikesherov> yeah, not dead
[08:00:37] <mikesherov> so, the question is, is this something we need to control
[08:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> TBH, I've always been a bit skeptical of their code.
[08:02:09] <mikesherov> so then let's do it ourselves
[08:02:09] <scott_gonzalez> It's not helping that all of their stuff is busted.
[08:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> Even their demo page is busted: http://javascriptmvc.com/funcunit/syn/synthetic.html
[08:02:20] <mikesherov> we have a pretty good base
[08:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's create the new repo.
[08:02:35] <mikesherov> and I hate relying on others for this when we have a pretty good foundation
[08:02:44] <mikesherov> gnarf: stopping waiting, make it
[08:04:07] <gnarf> done
[08:06:17] <mikesherov> thanks gnarf
[08:09:06] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: can you take ownership for jquery-simulate? Kind of like gnarf "owning" jquery-color?
[08:09:16] <mikesherov> Sure
[08:09:19] <jzaefferer> just to have someone to blame when it breaks
[08:09:29] <mikesherov> How do I do that? 
[08:09:34] <mikesherov> Oh, magic wand
[08:09:45] <jzaefferer> more an organizational thing
[08:09:55] <mikesherov> k
[08:10:01] <mikesherov> yeah, put me on the hook
[08:10:10] <jzaefferer> push code, make releases, copy over to jquery-ui, write docs (readme, contributing)
[08:10:21] <jzaefferer> the usual grind ;)
[08:11:09] <mikesherov> yup no problem
[08:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I'll obviously help out with it. I had planned on fixing it up during the 1.11 release.
[08:15:16] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: of course
[08:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> 45 minutes until the house is ours!
[08:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> Also, we're down to 387 tickets :-)
[08:19:50] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: that's so awesome
[08:19:53] <mikesherov> 387 is amazing
[08:20:02] <mikesherov> I thought we'd be at about 500 at best right now
[08:20:22] <mikesherov> but there was just so much cruft in there
[08:20:39] <mikesherov> p.s. house is awesome is what I meant
[08:20:44] <mikesherov> not 387 tickets
[08:22:21] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: we actually fixed a bunch of stuff, too, not just closing tickets as invalid or whatever
[08:22:34] <mikesherov> yeah, jzaefferer definitely
[08:22:40] <mikesherov> there were about 20 landed pulls
[08:22:45] <mikesherov> plus you did dialog stuff
[08:22:48] <mikesherov> plus plus pkus
[08:22:52] <mikesherov> we were galvanized
[08:23:00] <mikesherov> the dev summit did its job
[08:23:02] <jzaefferer> 1.9.2 had 20 bug fixes, we have a lot more for 1.10
[08:23:29] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15mikesherov pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/1qiYfQ

[08:23:47] <jzaefferer> The dev summit was a kick off to get you, tj_vantoll and petersendidit involved. For you probably not even the summit itself, but the aftermath :-)
[08:24:14] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: what's the mergatron status? Same as for Core? Or nothing new yet for us?
[08:24:37] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you're still working on multi-version support, right? Do you need help with the UI fixes?
[08:24:52] <jzaefferer> rworth: what's the status on moving to new-css?
[08:25:22] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: still banging on mergeatron
[08:25:34] <mikesherov> it's installed, but I haven't debugged jquery cores issue yet
[08:26:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, right Im on multi-version... I've finished the themeroller app cleanup first, so I could implement "remember versions" on top of that.
[08:26:24] <jzaefferer> okay, cool
[08:26:29] <rxaviers> :)
[08:26:41] <rxaviers> soon we'll have more commits to the multi versions PR
[08:26:48] <jzaefferer> so I guess the estimate there was a little low, but that refactoring was overdue anyway
[08:26:51] <rxaviers> which will be the finals I guess
[08:27:17] <rxaviers> The guess according to the plan I've created was pretty accurate actually
[08:27:51] <jzaefferer> kborchers: how much of Progressbar, according to the Roadmap items, is done?
[08:30:01] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: clicking on "http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/19", I get a "Invalid Report Number": http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/19 - should be replaced with report 30?
[08:30:24] <rxaviers> The thing is: I didnt account the two UI issues into the plan. By the way, we would be able to quicke dump some more code to handle that two issues. But, organizing TR frontend code was something that I'd like to do anyway. It's more clean now and easier to implement new things on top of it.
[08:30:50] <rxaviers> Will be worth the extra time now :)
[08:31:20] <rxaviers> (hopefully lol)
[08:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yes, where is that link?
[08:32:02] <scott_gonzalez> I deleted the old report.
[08:32:03] <jzaefferer> on the trac homepage
[08:32:09] <jzaefferer> to which there is no link anyway...
[08:32:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, yup, just fixed it.
[08:32:41] <scott_gonzalez> thanks.
[08:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go.
[08:34:08] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: was there ever a PR review meeting?
[08:34:17] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: no
[08:34:49] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I've updated most of the agenda already. As usual (for the last few months) I'm kind of busy at that time of the week/day, so may not be able to make it, again
[08:35:10] <kborchers> jzaefferer: still needs accessibility review, i think API redesign is looking good but need to go through it to make sure it's up to date with new widget factory stuff, etc., need to check test coverage but probably pretty close, there are currently no bugs in trac i don't think, and the wiki page still needs cleaning
[08:35:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: since I got updates from certain people or inserted my own, there shouldn't be that much need for discussion
[08:36:43] <jzaefferer> kborchers: okay, thanks
[08:37:16] <jzaefferer> kborchers: as last week, can you lead the meeting in case scott_gonzalez and me aren't available? Agenda is updated, should be smooth sailing.
[08:37:29] <kborchers> jzaefferer: will do
[08:37:50] <jzaefferer> thanks
[08:37:54] <kborchers> np
[08:39:50] <rworth> jzaefferer I got to about 80-90% on the ui sites
[08:40:05] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: could you help me cleaning up the dialog testsuite? There's a bunch of bogus assertions like those testing if methods are chainable, which should get dropped or replaced with something useful. Need to check which code doesn't have coverage, maybe by running jscoverage once or giving blanket.js a try: http://migrii.github.com/blanket/
[08:40:18] <rworth> need to do the same on the qunit sites. Be back on that over the next week now that I'm back from holidays
[08:40:21] <jzaefferer> rworth: heh, the last 10% :-)
[08:40:25] <rworth> :)
[08:40:35] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: no problem
[08:41:00] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: can you create a ticket, and assign it to me? or should I just put it on my big todo list
[08:41:26] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: your todo list sounds fine. I can create a ticket if you prefer that
[08:41:36] <mikesherov> no, no problem
[08:41:52] <jzaefferer> where on your big todo list would that land?
[08:42:11] <mikesherov> oh geez
[08:42:13] <mikesherov> HAHA
[08:42:18] <mikesherov> ok, so I have the following
[08:42:31] <mikesherov> 1. mergeatron
[08:42:34] <mikesherov> 2. core 1.9
[08:42:43] <mikesherov> 3. pull queue
[08:42:48] <mikesherov> UI pull queue
[08:43:01] <mikesherov> 4. simulate
[08:43:10] <mikesherov> 5. dialog test clean up
[08:43:18] <mikesherov> I bounce around though
[08:43:25] <mikesherov> might get done ahead of that other stuff
[08:44:02] <jzaefferer> okay. Maybe you can do a quick pass on dialog testsuite asap. Do an estimate afterwards, maybe its not even that bad.
[08:44:15] <jzaefferer> I've touched a few tests while working on issues, but no overall sweep

[08:49:59] <doesallmagic> rxaviers: Make init redirection generic
[08:50:27] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: do you know what in qunit (if anything) would cause a fail only on refresh
[08:50:43] <mikesherov> I load the test, the test passes, reload fails, reload passes, reload fails
[08:51:23] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: but only in the presence of OTHER tests
[08:51:38] <kborchers> mikesherov: oh, i've seen that. trying to remember what caused it but i think i remember it being me doing something wrong
[08:51:51] <mikesherov> kborchers: :-\
[08:52:42] <kborchers> oh make sure your tests don't rely on the outcome of other tests since failures will run first on refresh. i think that's what my problem was
[08:53:07] <mikesherov> that makes sense
[08:54:00] <tj_vantoll> mikesherov https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/74
[08:54:16] <kborchers> mikesherov: i wouldn't leave it in there but to test if that's the issue you can put QUnit.config.reorder = false; at the top and see if the refresh failures go away
[08:54:59] <mikesherov> yeah
[08:55:02] <mikesherov> thanks kborchers 
[08:55:06] <kborchers> np
[08:55:51] <mikesherov> so at least it fails now consistently
[08:55:54] <mikesherov> thanks kborchers 
[09:00:14] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: you're lucky, consistent failure is always the goal :-)
[09:00:28] <jzaefferer> well, after consistent pass, of course
[09:01:32] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: but that type of issue is also something I'd like to make QUnit more useful at. If you look at open issues, you'll see a bunch of tickets that are supposed to help the developer find issues in their testsuite
[09:01:47] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: awesome
[09:01:51] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: if you have ideas in that regard, please let me know, jquery/qunit issue preferred
[09:02:00] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: will do
[09:09:27] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #843: STILL FAILING in 46 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/843/
[09:09:28] <doesallmagic> mike.sherov: Button tests: simulated clicks aren't perfect in oldIE and Opera
[09:45:59] <jzaefferer> Thanks kborchers for the moderation. 
[09:46:09] <kborchers> np
[09:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm back, and in my new house...at least temporarily.
[10:03:36] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: So exciting!!!!! That must be amazing!
[10:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> yup :-)
[10:05:10] <agcolom> btw sorry for yesterday, I didn't know you knew about the thing on stage ;)
[10:14:43] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: in the house temporarily?
[10:15:50] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: hey sorry a little late - had an unexpected lunch... any idea about phone call with mikesherov?
[10:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: No problem, I should've done all the updates at the same time.
[10:16:32] <scott_gonzalez> I got distracted and left it half done.
[10:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Yeah, just here for a bit while Kristin paints part of the kitchen.
[10:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> We'll move some stuff in today, but won't be sleeping here tonight.
[10:17:41] <petersendidit> Ah, how much longer till the first night in the house?
[10:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure, depends on how quickly we paint and how quickly we get stuff moved in.
[10:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> So awesome that Verizon just sent me an email saying "Your device has used at least 50% of its data allowance."
[10:23:26] <Dave_Stein> at least they let you know haha
[10:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> The first few days I was frantically checking my usage, so it's nice to know that they send notices.
[10:56:45] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: No problem ;) just received a letter from my employer... I am considered as a potential illegal immigrant! (I've worked there 14 years!) not all non English people have received this letter! I am so shocked! BTW as EU citizen I have full right to be working in the UK, but still! Why me?
[10:58:20] <kborchers> agcolom: o_O
[10:59:12] <agcolom> kborchers: yep! I don't feel the love ;-) 
[10:59:36] <kborchers> agcolom: you should probably just move to the US ;)
[11:00:09] <agcolom> kborchers: yes ;-) that sounds like a good plan ;-) 
[11:05:19] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: That's messed up.
[11:05:33] <scott_gonzalez> And I agree with kborchers, you should just move to the US.
[11:05:41] <agcolom> must be the spanish surname ?
[11:09:05] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: thanks :-) would love to do that ;-) I am so shocked! right, I'll do lots of jQuery stuff this evening to make me feel better ;-) 
[11:35:23] <_zoggy_> http://haz.io/
[12:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, kids were in the house less than a minute and there's a 3 foot mark on the wall...
[12:08:43] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: you need strict rules ;-) no feet, no hands on the walls!
[12:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> Mya was walking down the stairs with a hot wheels car in her hand.
[12:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> She was so excited that she missed a step, fell, and dragged the car across the wall.
[12:09:43] <DaveMethvin> oh, saying there was a 3-foot skid mark on the wall would be more dramatic
[12:09:48] <agcolom> ok, so that was an accident! that's allowed ;-)
[12:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> At least its one of the walls that we plan on painting this week.
[12:10:32] <DaveMethvin> this is like the first scratch on a new car, you got it over with
[12:10:49] <agcolom> oh! I get it! 3 foot, not 3 feets! I only do metric ;-)
[12:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:11:18] <DaveMethvin> i blame England
[12:11:24] <kborchers> lol
[12:11:25] <scott_gonzalez> "...and there's a 1 meter mark on the wall..."
[12:11:34] <agcolom> that I get ;-)
[12:29:47] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I think jzaefferer was right ... let's not handle errors ... the fact that it breaks our nav forever after is a bad thing and we should fix it, but the fix shouldn't be to absorb errors.
[12:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the framework shouldn't be walling the error, but there was discussion of how to get events to still do proper error reporting while not letting errors in handlers kill other code.
[12:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> Native event dispatching has magical error handling.
[12:31:14] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: ^
[12:32:44] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez _|Nix|_ yes it does ... unfortunately it has really high overhead too, it's about 10x more expensive than a normal function call from an experiment jaubourg did
[12:33:06] <DaveMethvin> not sure how to get the magic without also taking the heat for being slow
[12:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> Have we talked to any browser vendors about it?
[12:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously wouldn't help us for a few years, but would be an interesting discussion.
[12:34:16] <DaveMethvin> not that i know of
[12:34:19] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Is this the really expensive way? trigger: function( e ) { try { /* body of trigger function */ } catch( e ) { setTimeout( function() { throw( e ); } ); } }?
[12:34:48] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: That way the error would be thrown in the next frame.
[12:34:57] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Lemme guess: disastrous.
[12:34:58] <DaveMethvin> i think this use case is that you get synchronous operation but aren't killed by an error, right?
[12:35:16] <DaveMethvin> any setTimeout becomes async
[12:35:31] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Yes, but doesn't the error itself contain the stacktrace?
[12:35:38] <DaveMethvin> not on all browsers
[12:35:45] <DaveMethvin> and it's different on diferent browsers :(
[12:36:00] <DaveMethvin> i think they've JUST standardized it in the past couple of months
[12:36:08] <DaveMethvin> so like, IE12 :P
[12:36:48] <DaveMethvin> the dean edwards trick was to trigger a native event, which the browser does insulate
[12:36:49] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: OK. Got it. So the error would be useless after the fact, eh?
[12:37:08] <DaveMethvin> well maybe for your particular case that woudl be fine
[12:37:16] <DaveMethvin> if you don't mind the work being done after the fn returns
[12:37:22] <DaveMethvin> but a lot of times it needs to be sync
[12:37:30] <DaveMethvin> like, resolving a promise for example
[12:37:41] <DaveMethvin> each callback has to be called in sequence
[12:38:07] <_|Nix|_> This is exactly what jzaefferer was saying. Re-throwing an error is tricky business and best avoided.
[12:38:09] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15fazzamar opened pull request #849: Updated button to fix IE7 styling bug w/ icons. (06master...06patch-2)  02http://git.io/7QJ7uw
[12:38:26] <DaveMethvin> yes, b/c in several browsers you totally lose error info
[12:39:07] <DaveMethvin> so instead of "jquery.js line 1519, object expected" you get "error: object expected"
[12:40:16] <DaveMethvin> http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2009/03/callbacks-vs-events/
[12:40:37] <DaveMethvin> dean edwards addresses the setTimeout thing there
[12:57:12] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin gnarf jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov: Anyone remember why I filed this? https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678678
[12:57:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure it spawned from something in jQuery (probably UI), but I can't remember what.
[12:57:42] <kborchers> looking
[12:58:06] <DaveMethvin> if you expect my memory to exceed yours, you are truly screwed :D
[12:58:42] <scott_gonzalez> Holy shit, that was a long time ago.
[12:59:34] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: damn, i remember this but don't remember what it came from
[12:59:44] <DaveMethvin> not ringing a bell for me
[13:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Yeah, I remember having a big discussion about this in IRC.
[13:00:07] <kborchers> yep
[13:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> I think even Paul Irish got involved.
[13:00:29] * DaveMethvin scrolls back 15 months...
[13:00:48] <DaveMethvin> damn non-infinite scrollback buffers
[13:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHAHA, looking at the UI Trac timeline to see if any tickets seem related. I found this on the day before: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4941#comment:4
[13:02:23] <kborchers> oh base
[13:02:25] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: So, having read that blog post, I can see how that technique can be expensive.
[13:02:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's too bad there's no cheap way
[13:03:19] <DaveMethvin> and unlike try/catch where they seem to only penalize you when it needs to catch, this is a big hit every time
[13:04:08] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: It's a huge hit! One event per callback! That's insane!
[13:05:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah, you might save a LITTLE bit by reusing the event for several callbacks but basically it's not a really performant way to go
[13:05:58] <DaveMethvin> that is, keep using the same event until an error occurred, then restart on the next callback
[13:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://irc.jquery.com/%23jqueryui-dev/%23jqueryui-dev_20110812.log.html
[13:06:45] <DaveMethvin> impressive scott_gonzalez
[13:06:58] <DaveMethvin> no wonder our disk drives are bloated :P
[13:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> The first line of that log is awesome: "kborchers: i can think of a million things i would rather do than to troubleshoot broken position unit tests in IE6 :/ especially when they are just weird results"
[13:07:41] <scott_gonzalez> And I think that's actually what this bug is about.
[13:08:07] <kborchers> i was thinking it was position
[13:08:41] <DaveMethvin> oh man, 15 months later and he's only through the first 162,000 of his million things, now it's back again
[13:10:15] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:10:39] <scott_gonzalez> It's not back :-P Boris just started a thread on www-style about this, trying to get the spec changed.
[13:10:54] <DaveMethvin> oh good

[18:21:11] <mikesherov> this is bizarre
[18:21:56] <mikesherov> kborchers: the reordering does it
[18:22:30] <mikesherov> so the thing is, it only works when it's literally the first test
[18:40:51] <mikesherov> petro
[18:40:57] <mikesherov> what a petro
[18:41:10] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you there?
[18:41:26] <mikesherov> I can't wrap my head around this button test failure in Opera
[18:41:33] <mikesherov> it's insane
[18:41:45] <mikesherov> it passes only if its the first test on the page
[18:41:58] <mikesherov> like, including just JSHinting
[18:42:16] <mikesherov> if I run the JSHint test, then that test, it runs zero assertions
[18:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'm here!
[18:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> crazy
[18:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> Let me just catch up on these other conversations.
[18:44:27] <mikesherov> k, thanks
[18:44:32] <mikesherov> and congrats on the closing today
[18:44:35] <mikesherov> must feel awesome
[18:45:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we just brought a couple van loads of stuff over from the storage unit.
[18:45:32] <scott_gonzalez> Kristin's downstairs unpacking some boxes.
[18:47:46] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: did you have a house before this, or were you in an apt?
[18:48:40] <scott_gonzalez> We had a house.
[18:48:48] <scott_gonzalez> We still do, for a few more hours :-P
[18:50:19] <mikesherov> ha, so not as big of a leap, but still awesome.
[18:50:26] <mikesherov> SO, anyway, about this test
[18:50:49] <mikesherov> if you turn off Qunit.config.reorder=false; it'll fail consistently
[18:51:19] <mikesherov> but if it's the first test, and I mean no matter what, (like even the JSHint test), it passes
[18:55:37] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...ok, so do you know why it didn't fail in http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1626 ?
[19:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Hold on, I suddenly don't have Java installed. How does that happen?
[19:05:49] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Doing local testing from BrowserStack?
[19:06:44] <tj_vantoll> Because I ran into some error like that a few days ago.
[19:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[19:07:27] <tj_vantoll> Trying to remember what I did.
[19:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> Well, right now I'm downloading a 50 MB Java update on my jetpack...
[19:08:26] <tj_vantoll> Apparently it was removed in an OS X update - http://osxdaily.com/2012/10/19/java-update-2012-006-os-x-removes-java/.
[19:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> wonderful
[19:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I've got it installed and updated, but BrowserStack is still telling me to install Java.
[19:19:24] <scott_gonzalez> And the Java Preferences app no longer exists...
[19:25:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, redownloading Java. What a mess.
[19:25:38] <tj_vantoll> They (BrowserStack) do have a way of setting up the tunnel via the command line now.
[19:25:49] <tj_vantoll> I haven't tried it yet.
[19:26:10] <Krinkle> but only for desktop testing afaik, not for use with the API
[19:26:41] <Krinkle> I usually use No-IP.org when I need to use browserstack API with local server
[19:26:55] <Krinkle> set up port forward in the router and run the little app to update the UP
[19:26:57] <Krinkle> IP *
[19:27:25] <tj_vantoll> Interesting.
[19:27:28] <Krinkle> e.g. http://krinkle.no-ip.org/github/jquery/testswarm/ (currently up)
[19:27:51] <Krinkle> which is localhost for me
[19:28:07] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez I mindlessly followed Apple's directions here - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5559 and I've been good ever since.
[19:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather not downgrade to Java 6 :-)
[19:28:56] <Krinkle> then make sure to submit the job to testswarm with that url and use testswarm-browserstack to automatically start browsers (or do it manually via node-browserstack)
[19:31:19] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? I reinstalled Java 7 and it's still not working.
[19:35:27] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: I had the same thing, its a tricky one
[19:35:33] <Krinkle> let me pull up how I fixed it
[19:35:43] <Krinkle> It told me I needed Java 7, but upgrading didn't matter
[19:35:53] <Krinkle> And it works fine in Firefox
[19:36:44] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: pm me your emailaddress
[19:36:55] <scott_gonzalez> scott.gonzalez@gmail.com
[19:37:11] <Krinkle> sent
[19:37:17] <Krinkle> (forwarded the issue thread of mine)
[19:38:20] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: apply http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5559  after Java 7 update
[19:38:42] <Krinkle> If, after installing Java for OS X 2012-006 and Java 7, you want to disable Java 7 and re-enable the Apple-provided Java SE 6 plug-in, follow these steps.
[19:38:42] <Krinkle> ``
[19:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't want Java 6...
[19:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> Sweet, deleted my plugin registry file and now Java works in Firefox.
[19:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I'll look at this tomorrow.
[19:45:29] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez You can see why I gave in now :)  Best of luck, I'm out for the night.
[19:46:08] <scott_gonzalez> Good night everyone.
