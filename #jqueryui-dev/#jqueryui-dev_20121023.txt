[06:55:40] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: What is core doing for fake vars?
[06:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> And thanks for the JSHint updates.
[07:11:59] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: fake vars?
[07:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> You and gnarf were talking about unused vars that are in signatures.
[07:13:45] <mikesherov> so, we're doing ( /*, arg*/ )
[07:13:49] <mikesherov> etc.
[07:14:00] <mikesherov> want me to do that for $.Widget?
[07:15:44] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[07:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[07:17:39] <gnarf> I'm a fan of that approach too
[07:19:59] <mikesherov> so, is that the only place I goofed?
[07:20:22] <gnarf> mikesherov: I wanted to keep the args around on effect too
[07:20:35] <gnarf> the one that passes straight to normalizeArguments
[07:20:42] <mikesherov> gnarf: scott_gonzalez: can you guys just comment on those lines as you find them
[07:20:48] <mikesherov> I'll do another update a bit later

[07:34:42] <mikesherov> gnarf: scott_gonzalez: I updated the PR
[07:35:02] <mikesherov> please let me know if you have any more comments https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/788
[07:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: If it looks good to you, then let's land it.
[07:35:28] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I are knee-deep in dialogs and 1.9.1 tickets :-)
[07:35:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ill land it quick
[07:35:48] <mikesherov> great
[07:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: One place that UI actually has more process than core is commit messages: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137737/Coding%20standards
[07:36:24] <mikesherov> yeah, I noticed
[07:36:28] <mikesherov> did I do it wrong?
[07:36:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, I didn't even link to the right doc.
[07:36:38] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/25941597/Commit%20Message%20Style%20Guide
[07:36:45] <mikesherov> OH
[07:36:48] <mikesherov> for COMMIT messages
[07:36:55] <mikesherov> not even just pull messages
[07:37:05] <mikesherov> got it, will fix in the future
[07:37:16] <mikesherov> I plan on doing some more clean up after this, scott_gonzalez, like getting rid of the other nonsense globals in the test suite. I ran it by jzaefferer, he seemed cool with it
[07:37:31] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Yup, because we use the commit messages to build our changelog.
[07:37:35] <mikesherov> right
[07:37:37] <mikesherov> that makes sense
[07:37:47] <mikesherov> core using the ticket numbers, so it's different
[07:37:51] <scott_gonzalez> And prefixing with the component makes it possible to sort :-)
[07:37:58] <mikesherov> yeah, makes sense
[07:38:11] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/KGaDmg
[07:38:11] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Build: Enable "unused" option in jshint - Remove unused variables from codebase. - Closes gh-788 - Mike Sherov
[07:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> Globals is tests are insane.
[07:38:30] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: agreed, that's why I'm unifying
[07:38:52] <mikesherov> even in the tests that will be blasted away. I think base state of sanity, even for things you're going to rewrite, is a good thing
[07:39:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, the final versions should be namespaced, like TestHelpers.accordion.
[07:39:22] <mikesherov> They'll now just dangle off TestHelpers in general
[07:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/accordion/accordion_test_helpers.js
[07:39:32] <mikesherov> then a future sweep, I can do what you said
[07:39:44] <mikesherov> or actually, I'll follow that standard now
[07:39:48] <mikesherov> no need to do it twice
[07:39:54] <mikesherov> glad I spoke to you about it
[07:39:55] <scott_gonzalez> But for stuff that's getting thrown away, like all the interaction tests that you cleaned up, just throwing them directly onto TestHelpers is fine.
[07:39:58] * gnarf goes to finish waking up, bbiab
[07:40:15] <mikesherov> OK, I'll keep it in mind
[07:40:27] <scott_gonzalez> I feel bad every time we get a new contributor.
[07:40:32] <mikesherov> No, it's OK
[07:40:38] <scott_gonzalez> Because there's so much bad (old) code in our repo.
[07:40:41] <mikesherov> I'm here to clean up
[07:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> And it's hard to see what the right thing to do is.
[07:41:13] <mikesherov> I have 2 goals: 1. get the tickets to a state of "no new"
[07:41:26] <mikesherov> and in doing so, about half will be closed
[07:41:36] <mikesherov> and it'll allow new contribs to have some clarity
[07:42:16] <mikesherov> and 2. get the codebase to a state where the test suite and quality tools work as needed
[07:42:32] <mikesherov> so we can start requiring tests with each pull, or as close to it as possible
[07:42:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez kborchers: speaking of accessbility: http://www.marcozehe.de/2012/10/22/accessibility-what-is-it-good-for/
[07:42:57] <mikesherov> I mean, my opinion is that even PR's on widgets that are getting rewritten are valuable if they have tests
[07:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> Those are my goals too :-)
[07:44:05] <mikesherov> so, I'm going to just to blunt force that to happen, while you and jzaefferer make the necessary updates to the widgets
[07:45:03] <mikesherov> the grunt work doesn't bother me as long as the goal is pure

[09:05:29] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: gnarf: hi
[09:05:29] <bot-t> (45 hours 20 mins ago) <gnarf> tell nacin just to make sure we don't forget about it - see https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/1e411430bf44b953dca458042d42cce0ba1bde94#commitcomment-2029153
[09:05:29] <bot-t> (39 hours 50 mins ago) <jzaefferer> tell nacin scott_gonzalez: found my grunt-wordpress issue. Turns out nginx has a client_max_body_size setting, limiting uploads to 1mb. Removed that limit locally, now its all good again. Debugging that was pretty annoying with the way the xml-rpc module doesn't handle invalid responses
[09:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> hey nacin
[09:06:03] <nacin> looking at the /resources/ .php issue
[09:06:20] <nacin> that commit complicated things
[09:06:55] <nacin> so, I think it be better if there were no executable code in /resources/
[09:07:11] <gnarf> nacin: yes?
[09:08:07] <gnarf> so how do we handle the autocomplete demo?
[09:08:26] <nacin> we could toss that file somewhere else
[09:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> That would complicate things.
[09:08:58] <nacin> "uploads" directories are generally blocked from having executable code, for security reasons.
[09:09:29] <gnarf> nacin: isn't there some qualifier we can add to catch all the wordpress links in that last rewrite?
[09:09:43] <nacin> that really doesn't have to do with it
[09:09:50] <nacin> you can set a location block to run early and bail
[09:10:02] <nacin> this was a one-character change
[09:11:12] <gnarf> nacin: all "location" blocks "bail" in nginx
[09:11:35] <gnarf> they also run last
[09:11:38] <gnarf> so the if() runs after them
[09:11:41] <gnarf> er before
[09:11:42] <gnarf> sorry
[09:11:49] <gnarf> even though its after in the conf
[09:12:09] <gnarf> the rewrite was messing up the urls... the added php resources section was just to enable executing php there
[09:12:16] <nacin> ideally we just move the ifs into location blocks, but I have it working here
[09:12:26] <nacin> testing something
[09:12:46] <nacin> Splunk takes forever with puppet
[09:13:07] <gnarf> sure, if we have a location block instead of the if/rewrite it should be better
[09:13:25] <gnarf> nacin: sorry, I'm working on making some more "direct" vagrant configs like "wordpress" to just test the class
[09:13:40] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have much to add to this discussion, other than being able to upload php files is kind of important for us.
[09:13:41] <gnarf> avoid all the extra crap it clones, what not
[09:14:24] <nacin> okay
[09:14:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: its risky - if someone ever snakes the w
[09:15:08] <gnarf> the xml-rpc password they can root us pretty quick
[09:15:38] <nacin> I'd rather just commit said .php file directly to the jqueryui theme on web-base-template or something
[09:15:43] <nacin> unless there's really going to be a lot of these
[09:15:59] <gnarf> it kinda sucks to not have that php file right next to it in the repo tho
[09:16:02] <gnarf> its part of the demo
[09:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> It's not that there's going to be a lot, it's that it makes it really painful to keep things in sync.
[09:16:33] <nacin> we could always do a whitelist
[09:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> Also painful.
[09:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> Though I guess slightly better.
[09:17:04] <nacin> we just whitelist in nginx PHP files within /resources/
[09:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'd imagine the whitelist would quickly get out of date.
[09:17:41] <gnarf> nacin: i'm pretty sure it is "only in /resources"
[09:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, if you're saying that /resources/*.php would work, that's all I want.
[09:17:50] <gnarf> that we actually need it
[09:17:54] <nacin> gnarf: right
[09:17:57] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[09:18:08] <gnarf> but because i had to comment that rewrite, its allowing anything is what you're sayin?
[09:18:28] <gnarf> also, i could make it only for jqueryui.com
[09:19:01] <nacin> I can re-jigger the nginx configs to avoid if statements
[09:19:11] <nacin> and install a whitelist
[09:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> It sounds like you have this under control, gonna grab lunch.
[09:37:47] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: gnarf: hi! If I have an XML file and and XSLT file, do you have a server/system to do the transformation? (currently I have a PHP file to do this but the server on which this can run (which requires PHP5) required a uni login and password for people outside of uni to view it! So at the moment I cannot show you what I've done :-( (it's not finished yet, so it can wait a bit I suppos
[09:37:47] <agcolom> e... ) I don't know how to use node for this, as I guess it could otherwise be the solution...

[09:41:20] <doesallmagic> joern.zaefferer: Grunt: Disable csslint's vendor-prefix rule, we're including only the prefixes that are still necessary in supported browsers
[10:25:24] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Do you have xsltproc installed locally?
[10:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you must.
[10:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> That's what we use for the API sites.
[10:33:49] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I think that's what I use on that server at uni. I do not have it locally though (I think)
[10:34:34] <agcolom> (When you say locally, you mean on my laptop?
[10:36:33] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:37:11] <agcolom> since I use grunt deploy on my laptop for the api docs, does that mean I have it installed?
[10:37:15] <scott_gonzalez> The API sites just call xsltproc directly: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/master/tasks/build-xml.js#L83
[10:37:18] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:37:31] <agcolom> ok...
[10:37:41] <scott_gonzalez> If you run xsltproc in your terminal, it should spit out help info.
[10:39:04] <agcolom> yes, I tried in the api.jquerymobile.com folder and yes I got some help info
[10:39:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so you should be able to run this in your terminal: xsltproc foo.xsl bar.xml
[10:42:05] <agcolom> yes, it printed the html in the terminal! So do I then go > file.html?
[10:42:23] <agcolom> xsltproc foo.xsl bar.xml > file.html
[10:42:24] <agcolom> ?
[10:45:52] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:46:13] <agcolom> ok, all done... here's version 1 (needs windowInfo on the map, so currently you cannot get info on the markers)
[10:46:15] <agcolom> http://users.cscs.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jQueryMap/teamMap.html
[10:46:34] <scott_gonzalez> You can also use `--output out.ext`
[10:46:42] <scott_gonzalez> But `> out.ext` will work as well.
[10:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> haha, what's up with the broken encoding?
[10:47:15] <agcolom> xml file is http://users.cscs.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jQueryMap/team.xml
[10:47:23] <agcolom> broken encoding?
[10:47:58] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/213m2S3U2S0A
[10:48:32] <agcolom> oh, that must be the #160;
[10:49:02] <agcolom> (sorry the &#160; space in xslt)
[10:49:36] <agcolom> which browser gives you that error?
[10:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome
[10:50:53] <agcolom> actually I get it as well!!!! sorry! I didn't get it when using php to run xsltproc
[10:50:58] <agcolom> will fix that...
[10:52:12] <agcolom> the idea of the listview is so that people can search by name, location, project, etc...
[10:53:36] <agcolom> I will also make the map fullscreen (currently 600px height)
[10:54:18] <agcolom> I was thinking we could also add the github or irc nicknames?
[10:58:34] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: the encoding error is now fixed
[10:59:16] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub + IRC seems good.
[10:59:35] <agcolom> ok will add that...
[10:59:57] <agcolom> probably not today though... Had crazy day and now cooking dinner...

[12:35:20] <jzaefferer> just demos
[12:35:59] <_zoggy_> jzaefferer, you're fired.
[12:36:02] <_zoggy_> i kid
[12:36:13] <_zoggy_> but no bonus check for you this year
[12:36:32] <_zoggy_> :focsable ?
[12:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We broke tracking with web-base-template? http://cl.ly/image/1s2d0C440M1C
[12:39:09] <jzaefferer> gnarf nacin: around? could you check why jqueryui.com isn't getting deployed? looking at jq01
[12:40:10] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #726: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/726/
[12:40:11] <doesallmagic> * Scott González: Accordion: Remove code that sets accordion height. Fixed #8696 - Multiple collapsible Accordions won't work together.
[12:40:11] <doesallmagic> * joern.zaefferer: Menu: Remove stupid demos, add an icons demo, improve the default demo
[12:40:12] <doesallmagic> * Scott González: Dialog: Don't use deprecated offset option for .position(). Fixes #8675 - Dialog: Position with pixels in array doesn't work with back compat disabled.
[12:42:25] <jzaefferer> gnarf: looking at jq02 I found the deployment, looks like it worked fine
[12:44:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer when did we change to the grey background? looks strange with the colored top/bottom borders IMO
[12:44:26] <jzaefferer> gnarf nacin: http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/demo-list.json - says Last-Modified Mon, 08, but it was deployed just now
[12:45:00] <jzaefferer> gnarf: stage got updated, live is broken, as only web-base-template got updated
[12:45:24] <kborchers> or is that what is broken? :)
[12:45:25] <jzaefferer> kborchers: that's a cache issue, the background is back to normal after a reload
[12:45:35] <kborchers> gotcha
[13:00:34] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/G2JZkw
[13:00:34] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Revert "Sort demos by title" - Jörn Zaefferer
[13:01:32] <jzaefferer> well, now stage is broken
[13:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[13:01:55] <jzaefferer> gnarf: let me know when you're around. Once we figure out the deployment, I'll revert those two commits and push/tag again...
[13:08:54] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/7K6Z0g
[13:08:54] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Menu: How to include icons. Fixes #57 - Jörn Zaefferer
[13:26:13] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #727: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/727/
[13:26:14] <doesallmagic> * Scott González: Tooltip tests: Fixed new default value for position option.
[13:26:15] <doesallmagic> * Scott González: Core: Update :focsable and :tabbable to handle parents with no height/width, but visible overflow. Fixes #8643 - :focusable pseudo-selector does not find elements if parent has 0x0 dimension.
[13:26:15] <doesallmagic> * Scott González: Updated list of maintainers.
[13:30:22] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: could you update external/jshint.js to use the same version as grunt/node?
[13:30:27] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer force-pushed dialog from 3f9616a to 8440dc9: http://git.io/kawbpA

[13:37:23] <gnarf> jzaefferer: what happened?
[13:37:25] <gnarf> I'm a little lost reading that one
[13:42:12] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I pushed tags for both web-base-template and jqueryui.com at the same time
[13:42:24] <jzaefferer> web-base-template was updated, jqueryui.com didn't deploy, breaking all the demos
[13:42:33] <jzaefferer> I reverted both to fix the live site
[13:42:35] <gnarf> hrm
[13:42:43] <jzaefferer> I have no clue why jqueryui.com didn't get deployed
[13:42:47] <jzaefferer> stage worked fine
[13:43:27] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/f07fe34d2384ee4a78c5
[13:43:32] <gnarf> grunt failed
[13:44:15] <jzaefferer> where did you find that?
[13:44:37] <jzaefferer> also my first push was at 12:32
[13:45:19] <gnarf> jzaefferer: cat /var/log/syslog | grep jqueryui.com.sh
[13:45:25] <gnarf> on jq02
[13:45:26] <jzaefferer> gnarf: which server?
[13:45:50] <gnarf> the first one failed here:
[13:45:55] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/7356adb25fc70c1f2c6a
[13:46:09] <gnarf> jq02 is the "builder"
[13:47:39] <jzaefferer> gnarf: right, that's the first deploy
[13:47:53] <jzaefferer> so that doesn't really help either
[13:47:57] <gnarf> jzaefferer: nope
[13:48:03] <gnarf> jzaefferer: no idea why that one failed
[13:48:11] <jzaefferer> crap
[13:48:54] <gnarf> I really need to add a feedback loop for these things
[13:49:00] <gnarf> just not sure how I get it out right now
[13:49:25] <gnarf> save for grepping the logs, like how could I inform the people deploying about errors, etc
[13:49:30] <gnarf> from multiple boxes
[13:50:24] <gnarf> either way, now that we are all here to debug, want to try again?
[13:50:46] <thabersack> I'd like to submit a fix for an ambiguous part of the api doc. Where could I do that? I looked into submitting a bug, but there is no category for doc enhancements.
[13:50:47] <gnarf> that - or lets set a time a little later -- less "prime" to look at it?
[13:51:02] <gnarf> thabersack: http://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com
[13:51:20] <gnarf> the content is there and you could file a pull - or just file an issue
[13:51:53] <thabersack> Wow, how did I not see that in the project list.. many thanks!
[13:58:46] <gnarf> jzaefferer: if I don't seem alive in IRC - ping skype
[14:03:41] <jzaefferer> thabersack: we'll add github repo links on the site, will make finding these a lot easier
[14:03:50] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yeah, let's try again later
[14:04:29] <gnarf> jzaefferer: sounds good, i should be up til 10/11 eastern
[14:04:45] <gnarf> might not be active in IRC tho - skype should grab my attention
[14:04:47] <thabersack> jzaefferer: Excellent!
[14:05:08] <jzaefferer> gnarf: okay. I'll probably try to deploy from local machine to live, to have better chances at debugging this
[14:28:39] <nacin> why does web-base-template load jQuery in the head, rather than at the end of the page?
[14:29:47] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Something about download builder.
[14:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right, because we load scripts in the page content.
[14:30:13] <scott_gonzalez> And they refernece jQuery
[14:30:29] <nacin> getting some flack that WordPress does the same, and I'd like to give them a decent reason why we shouldn't change it
[14:30:43] <nacin> that's enough for me
[14:33:33] <gnarf> nacin: script at the end is smarter if all scripts are at the end and none will ever be in content
[14:33:39] <gnarf> but really...
[14:33:49] <gnarf> there are better "optimizations" :)
[14:46:48] <jzaefferer> gnarf: Scott thinks its an nginx issue
[14:47:10] <jzaefferer> where nginx blocks the xml-rpc requests; considering the recent nginx config changes, that seems like a likely culprit
[14:47:28] <jzaefferer> its working fine on stage though, which probably just means that our staging env sucks
[14:47:31] <gnarf> agree
[14:47:37] <jzaefferer> doesn't match like env closely enough
[14:47:38] <gnarf> stage might not be on newest
[14:48:32] <gnarf> verifying
[14:48:32] <jzaefferer> gnarf: something I can do here?
[14:49:37] <jzaefferer> gnarf: looks like xml-rpc is getting back "File not found.", that looks like a nginx error, right?
[14:49:48] <gnarf> whats the url for xml-rpc?
[14:50:12] <gnarf> stage is running the exact same nginx conf as live right now
[14:50:26] <jzaefferer> yeah
[14:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's just /xml-rpc.php
[14:50:29] <gnarf> just verified w/ puppet
[14:50:35] <scott_gonzalez> sorry, /xmlrpc.php
[14:50:46] <gnarf> is it erroring on stage?
[14:50:58] <jzaefferer> gnarf: its not erroring on stage
[14:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> gotta go
[14:51:10] <jzaefferer> at least it wasn't last I tried a few minutes ago
[14:51:11] <gnarf> hrm
[14:51:27] * gnarf scratches head
[14:51:39] <jzaefferer> gnarf: http://jqueryui.com/xmlrpc.php
[14:51:44] <jzaefferer> that should be it...
[14:51:48] <gnarf> aye, confirm, broken here too
[14:52:50] <gnarf> double checking on some configs
[15:02:16] <gnarf> jzaefferer: pushing a fix in a minute
[15:05:27] <gnarf> nacin: xmlrpc.php is the only non "wp-" file in the wordpress folder
[15:05:38] <gnarf> rather than .*\.php we can just xmlrpc.php
[15:05:51] <gnarf> nacin: confirm?
[15:07:12] <gnarf> jzaefferer: live xmlrpc.php seems to work on our domains now for me
[15:07:23] <gnarf> as to why it worked on stage?
[15:07:42] * gnarf shrugs
[15:24:00] <nacin> without the rewrite, xmlrpc.php would still have worked except on api.jqueryui.com/1.8
[15:24:13] <nacin> we could remove a bunch of rules for any sites without subdirectory sites
[15:24:32] <nacin> I'd like to simplify that whole setup at some point
[16:07:06] <gnarf> nacin: it wasn't working until i made that change on jqueryui.com
[16:16:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: npm ls retruns a non-zero exit code if there is something that doesn't meet package.json
[16:20:17] <gnarf> also
[16:20:19] <gnarf> check out
[16:20:21] <gnarf> npm ls --json
[16:20:26] <gnarf> npm ls -pl
[17:23:43] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - git core build #173: STILL FAILING in 9 min 2 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/173/
[17:29:44] <jzaefferer> gnarf: so deployment should be working again, right?
[17:32:08] <gnarf> jzaefferer: correct
[17:33:13] <jzaefferer> gnarf: regarding npm verify, we should just run `npm ls` and check for non-zero exist code, then dump the output and fail the build?
[17:33:51] <jzaefferer> trying to deploy to live again, if it works, I'll push a web-base-template tag, then tag jqueryui.com and push that as well
[17:34:26] <jzaefferer> well, its deploying
[17:35:28] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yup
[17:35:33] <gnarf> jzaefferer: npm ls || exit basicaly
[17:35:53] <gnarf> you can actually just dump the output | grep "ERR"
[17:35:54] <gnarf> too
[17:35:59] <gnarf> it is all informative
[17:36:01] <gnarf> check it out
[17:36:27] <jzaefferer> yay, properly sorted demos with Default at the top: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[17:37:03] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/oiuRTA
[17:37:03] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Revert "Revert "Sort demos by title"" - Jörn Zaefferer
[17:37:33] <gnarf> actually
[17:37:40] <gnarf> i just found a case its not very useful
[17:37:46] <gnarf> its telling me i have a module i don't need anymore
[17:37:53] <gnarf> and non-zero exit
[17:37:54] <gnarf> :/
[17:38:21] <gnarf> also
[17:38:23] <gnarf> yeah
[17:38:27] <gnarf> going back to isaac
[17:39:10] <gnarf> we could however
[17:39:14] <gnarf> parse npm ls --json
[17:39:16] <gnarf> and compare it
[17:40:08] <jzaefferer> does --json provide anything for verification?
[17:40:17] <jzaefferer> or is it as useless as --parseable?
[17:42:31] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/WebEbg
[17:42:31] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Update page/support.html - Mike Hostetler
[17:46:35] <gnarf> jzaefferer: the json object has [library].version
[17:46:42] <gnarf> so its like same format as package.json
[17:46:47] <gnarf> should be a quick walk over two maps
[17:46:57] <gnarf> but yeah
[17:47:03] <gnarf> then we need to parse the package.json
[17:50:39] <jzaefferer> how hard is to link to the right site? https://github.com/airportyh/testem/pull/64
[17:51:35] <jzaefferer> gnarf: extraneous don't seem like a big deal, just rimraf node_modules and `npm install` again
[17:51:51] <jzaefferer> we could probably automate that...
[17:52:03] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i could make http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit a moved permanently
[17:52:14] <jzaefferer> yes please
[17:52:23] <jzaefferer> that should help with search engines, right?
[17:52:28] <gnarf> yes
[17:52:35] <Krinkle> wtf?
[17:52:45] <Krinkle> #REDIRECT [[http://qunitjs.com]]
[17:52:48] <Krinkle> that doesnt' work ;-)
[17:53:02] <jzaefferer> I mean, googling for "qunit" brings up good results, but the wiki is still second result
[17:53:03] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez:
[17:53:14] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: test before leaving town ;-)
[17:53:18] <gnarf> Krinkle: can you make that redirect work? :)
[17:53:20] <Krinkle> now it is a broken page
[17:53:23] <Krinkle> it was working
[17:53:23] <gnarf> since you're here?
[17:53:41] <Krinkle> on it
[17:54:02] <jzaefferer> so docs.jquery.com/QUnit actually redirects
[17:54:18] <jzaefferer> but /Qunit shows up in google results
[17:54:40] <gnarf> ohhh
[17:54:43] <gnarf> heh
[17:56:18] <jzaefferer> in case someone has more ideas: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/116
[18:00:01] <Krinkle> redirect fixed (wrong channel)

[18:53:35] <ryanneufeld> I'll be home earlier
[18:53:43] <ryanneufeld> could do around the same time
[18:53:46] <mikesherov> what about thursday actually
[18:53:52] <mikesherov> tomorrow night I have a thing
[18:54:25] <mikesherov> gnarf: could you attempt to clear the nginx cache on bugs
[18:54:35] <mikesherov> find /path/to/cache -type f -exec rm {}\;
[18:54:35] <ryanneufeld> I have a thing on thursday
[18:55:19] <mikesherov> hm
[18:56:19] <gnarf> mikesherov: i'm 90% sure that nginx doesn't cache anything on bugs
[18:56:30] <mikesherov> yeah, it's just baffling gnarf
[18:56:33] <gnarf> mikesherov: at least i saw no trace of any _cache params
[18:56:41] <mikesherov> why the changes don't take
[18:56:44] <ryanneufeld> mikesherov: how about I ping you when I get home, and if you have time great, if not, another day?
[18:56:52] <mikesherov> that works
[18:56:54] <gnarf> mikesherov: restart tracd?
