[08:07:29] <sgharms> Is there a test I can crib from which tests TAB and shift-TAB behavior?  I've just re-opened https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/953 and want to provide the requested unit tests that ensure TAB order is working properly.  I _think_ i have it working, but this has (*ahem*) proved faillible in the past and I'd like to have the insurance.

[08:41:36] <scott_gonzalez> Any objection to removing jquery.ui.base.css?
[08:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> Just move all the @imports into jquery.ui.all.css.
[08:51:18] <petersendidit> nope
[09:45:39] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez No concerns but I'm curious why that separation was done in the first place.
[09:45:54] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Probably because the theme is optional.
[09:46:12] <scott_gonzalez> But in practice, we don't use base.css.
[09:46:46] <tj_vantoll> Ok.
[09:46:48] * rxaviers is back from lunch
[09:49:19] <rxaviers> no objection. any reason to remove it? simplification?
[09:50:38] <rxaviers> ps: removing it adds one more if version a do this, if version b, do that in DB.. :P
[09:53:22] <rxaviers> (disclosure: the ps is NOT a resistance for not removing it. It just makes me think how this could be notified to DB in a loose way --- via manifests)
[09:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> The reason to remove it is to avoid nested @imports.

[13:01:18] <scott_gonzalez> There are no tests that cover this.
