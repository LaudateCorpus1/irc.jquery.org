[06:20:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: lol @ 7997!!
[06:20:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, what a ridiculous bug.
[06:20:23] <bot-t> (42 hours 20 mins ago) <kborchers> tell scott_gonzalez this is somewhat unsettling my machine Chrome 15 http://gyazo.com/bc3b26e9f16e116347c0ed3ea261eaf0 Browserstack Chrome 15 http://gyazo.com/2190f97245e427821543622248e36198 looks like they're using limited colors on the VM display. wasn't always like this. maybe just a temporary issue
[06:22:59] <scott_gonzalez> I understand that you're writing JavaScript, but I'm not. And my language has different semantics. Also, JavaScript might one day change in a way that would break all existing code.
[06:26:22] <kborchers> heh
[06:30:59] <jzaefferer> its 2012, time for new apocalypse theories!
[06:44:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that interactions stuff looks nice
[06:47:26] <kborchers> jzaefferer: 1.9 is finally released causing the entire world to gasp at the same time. this in turn causes a sudden drop in barometric pressure which spins up giant hurricanes that cover the globe destroying all civilzation. The following day, any surviving jQuery team members receive a hand delivered bug report stating "jayquerries broked my house. box widget would fix using all magic. here is example http://gyazo.com/15c619f00365e8392
[06:47:27] <kborchers> be3d55f68a30677"
