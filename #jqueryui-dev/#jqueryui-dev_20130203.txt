[11:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Did you see the class animation ticket that just came in?
[11:19:56] <mikesherov> not yet
[11:20:33] <mikesherov> animate descendants‚Ä¶ oof
[11:20:51] <scott_gonzalez> We have code for this, but it seems like it could be a perf killer.
[11:21:04] <mikesherov> we do?
[11:21:08] <mikesherov> I think scale does
[11:21:19] <mikesherov> but it's only width
[11:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, you can pass { children: true } to $.effects.animateClass
[11:21:45] <mikesherov> is it broken
[11:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> no, it works
[11:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, actually, I guess that means you can pass it to the $.fn methods as well.
[11:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> We just don't documet it.
[11:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> Let me verify.
[11:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> yup, it works
[11:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/usivec/3/edit
[11:23:30] <scott_gonzalez> Search for toggleClass in the HTML panel
[11:24:06] <mikesherov> well then
[11:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> So we just need to document this.
[11:24:13] <mikesherov> sounds like we just document it?
[11:24:22] <mikesherov> easiest ticket ever
[11:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:27:23] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/904 seems like a pretty big change
[11:27:24] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #904 by nyanhan (3d 6h ago): Sortable: $.contains() give the wrong arguments. Fixed #9036 - $.contains() give the wrong arguments.
[11:27:39] <scott_gonzalez> Especially for something that was reported as just passing arguments in the wrong order.
[11:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> Also somehow messed up whitespace in various places.
