[05:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: The original plan for simultaneous launch actually wasn't that bad.
[05:56:05] <scott_gonzalez> But lots of (good) changes along the way made it much more complicated.
[05:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Sorry if I dropped the ball on getting back to you yesterday. I'm avaialble all day to get your WordPress install working.
[06:00:34] <kswedberg> np scott_gonzalez. I kind of dropped the ball, too. you have time now?

[06:02:31] <kswedberg> lol. ok. you gonna have me on speaker phone?
[06:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, no, I've got my headphones on, it just might be a bit loud in the background.

[06:10:14] <jzaefferer> yikes
[06:10:28] <jzaefferer> well, take a look a their kitchen, you might be surprised :p

[19:09:17] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez ping
[19:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> pong
[19:09:51] <kborchers> hey, you have NVDA or JAWS handy to test this https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/8f1a96ac54ad9a26825cf301b5224ee2e6815558  seems ok to me but want to make sure
[19:09:52] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by kborchers (6m, 34s ago): Menu: Remove unnecessary delays
[19:10:20] <kborchers> i don't see any difference in functionality removing those delays
[19:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, let me launch a VM.
[19:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> Now I need to remember which VM has NVDA...
[19:11:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez cool thanks. i tested NVDA on my vm as well and it seems ok but obviously i don't use it all the time :P
[19:11:56] <kborchers> heh
[19:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, this is going to be a crazy old version of Firefox.
[19:12:34] <kborchers> and the clicking in FF and other browsers doesn't seem any different from removing that delay either
[19:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> That's probably good though.
[19:13:10] <kborchers> i did not test old FF since we don't support. i tested FF13
[19:13:23] <kborchers> so we only support 13 and 12 right?
[19:13:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[19:13:31] <kborchers> ok
[19:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> But it'd be good if there's a problem in old Firefox.
[19:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> Because that would explain the delay.
[19:14:20] <kborchers> yeah
[19:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> 8.0, not *too* bad
[19:14:54] <kborchers> what are you seeing?
[19:15:01] <kborchers> that seems off
[19:15:54] <kborchers> oh, you mean not too old?
[19:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'm seeing a beach ball as my memory gets sucked away.
[19:16:59] <kborchers> lol, not sure a delay will help there :P
[19:19:24] <scott_gonzalez> NVDA is really confused.
[19:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> And this is against master.
[19:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> Let me update Firefox.
[19:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> As soon as I open a submenu, it seems to switch modes.
[19:20:23] <scott_gonzalez> And the focus starts moving without updating classes and I get different announcments.
[19:20:34] <kborchers> yeah, that doesn't seem right. i know it was fine before these changes the last time we tested everything
[19:20:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's like the key events aren't propagating to JS.
[19:20:36] <kborchers> that's weird
[19:21:31] <kborchers> and it didn't do that for me against my last set of changes
[19:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, Firefox is hanging on the update.
[19:23:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, now it's running.
[19:23:55] <kborchers> sorry, didn't realize asking for a quick test was going to turn into this
[19:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> The pitch of the beeps is getting higher :-) Almost done installing...
[19:24:02] <kborchers> heh
[19:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> Updated to 12 and I'm stilling having the problem.
[19:26:39] <scott_gonzalez> When I open a submenu, it seems to switch modes.
[19:26:58] <kborchers> hmmm, what do you mean by switch modes?
[19:32:36] <scott_gonzalez> I think it switches to caret navigation mode.
[19:32:53] <scott_gonzalez> I can try to show you with screen sharing.
[19:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if the wifi here will shit itself though :-P
