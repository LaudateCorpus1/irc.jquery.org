[03:42:35] <mgol> scott_gonzalez: I think the blog post should say "jQuery UI 1.12 officially supports jQuery 1.7.2 â€“ 3.1.1.", not "1.7.0-3.1.0". Or maybe just "1.7-3.1". You're not testing on 1.7.0 and you are on 3.1.1.
[03:43:36] <mgol> Also, it ends with "If you have feedback on us doing our release for jQuery UI 1.12.1, feel free to leave a comment below. Thank you." followed by  "Comments are closed." :-)
