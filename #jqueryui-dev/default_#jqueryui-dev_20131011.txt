[06:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: You linked to the wrong fiddle in that ticket.
[06:09:37] <scott_gonzalez> Also, we don't support the original use case.
[06:09:46] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I just realized I screwed up.
[06:09:55] <scott_gonzalez> But we want to support something very close to that.
[06:09:55] <tj_vantoll> master actually fixes the issue he's having.
[06:10:05] <tj_vantoll> I was trigger happy.
[06:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> You have to append to the iframe before creating the draggable.
[06:10:39] <tj_vantoll> Yeah and that works fine with relatively positioned iframes: http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/fScJH/1/
[06:10:47] <tj_vantoll> And it didn't in 1.10.3.
[06:11:20] <tj_vantoll> I'll clean up my mess :P
[06:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks :-)
[06:12:10] <tj_vantoll> Should I close #9594 as fixed?
[06:12:37] <tj_vantoll> It is an issue in 1.10.3. I'm assuming https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/24756a978a977d7abbef5e5bce403837a01d964f#diff-f017851fe830b75a65f4f6973051aee5 fixed the problem.
[06:12:37] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: Brian Grinstead (39mon 3w ago): Draggable: enabled draggable from within iframe. Fixed #5727 - draggable: cannot drag element inside iframe
[06:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe close it as a dupe of #5727
[06:28:16] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: http://i.imgur.com/R2romJT.png appropriate way to document zero to many args?
[06:29:11] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...let's see what core does.
[06:29:22] <tj_vantoll> http://api.jquery.com/append/
[06:29:40] <tj_vantoll> I guess that's a bit different since it requires at least one.
[06:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jquery.com/append/#append-content-content
[06:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:30:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I can't think of something in core that has a singature like this.
[06:30:38] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we should add support into the XSL template.
[06:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> <argument rest="true" ...>
[06:31:17] <tj_vantoll> Yeah this is tricky.
[06:31:53] <scott_gonzalez> It would print ... after the parameter in the signature.
[06:32:00] <scott_gonzalez> And it would inject a sentence after the description.
[06:32:35] <scott_gonzalez> So for append it'd be <argument name="content" rest="true">
[06:32:54] <tj_vantoll> That's not a bad idea. As long as the description isn't handled by the templates,
[06:32:56] <scott_gonzalez> For _super(), it'd be <argument name="arg" optional="true" rest="true">
[06:33:15] <tj_vantoll> Ah intereting.
[06:33:16] <scott_gonzalez> The description would be handled by the XML, but the XSL would add a sentence at the end.
[06:33:21] <tj_vantoll> You could handle both.
[06:33:47] <scott_gonzalez> Or we could just not add a description at the end.
[06:33:57] <scott_gonzalez> And the XSL would just modify the signature.
[06:35:09] <tj_vantoll> I think I like the signature only approach.
[06:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:35:38] <tj_vantoll> Want to be careful not to add too much intelligence for this because I could see the need for some very custom wording.
[06:35:58] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.

[07:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> [ argument [, ... ] ]
[07:04:21] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I guess that should be [ argument ] [, ... ] for our syntax.

[10:31:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping! Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6596: I can probably make that modification on master ... if it fixes a leak, it should be applied. I can mention the OP in the commit message.
[10:31:24] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6596 by nonplus (2h 42m ago): Navigation: Only bind to browser's AnimationEnd event. Fixes #5156.
[10:33:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i just wanted to make sure that those events and the check cover everything
[10:34:03] <arschmitz> but yes it should be fixed and it does work as they describe .one if you supply multiple events is once for each supplied event
[10:34:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, we could fix this another way. In the handler attached with .on() we could call .off() for both events.
[10:34:22] <arschmitz> yeah that would work also
[10:34:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I'll fix it my way, because that does not expose us to possibly hooking up to the wrong event in some environments.
[10:35:03] <arschmitz> yup
[10:35:14] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'm on it.
[10:35:19] <arschmitz> cool thank you
[10:40:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I'm not so sure that it's gonna be that easy ... I have to make sure that I use a unique event ns, so I'll probably have to do a global counter, and a new scope holding the value of the counter and stuff like that.
[10:40:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if its going to be more complex mind just doing a PR for it and ill take a look when your done?
[10:41:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I think so ... 
[10:41:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wanna make sure that .off() removes exactly those handlers which .one() attaches.
[10:42:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe one is better for this case
[10:42:22] <arschmitz> and just make sure we are robust enough in selecting right event
[10:43:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but is that PR absolutely correct for all environments?
[10:43:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: After all, it kinda does an in-place support test.
[10:43:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: "WebKitTransitionEvent" in window
[10:44:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure i have not had a chance to check about the animation end events yet and make sure that covers it
[10:44:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i wonder if we are doing the same thing other places like in panel i kinda think we are
[10:45:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, actually, using $.fn.animationComplete() is pretty leaky because sometimes it doesn't even fire.
[10:46:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For example, in the case of popup, if the animation is in progress while a navigate/pagebeforechange event arrives, the popup aborts whatever it's doing and quits.
[10:46:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe we need to think about this in a more general sense before we fix
[10:46:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, the handler never gets called.
[10:46:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we should deprecate .animationComplete()
[10:47:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Since there's the chance of a leak even when you only attach to a single event.
[10:48:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In fact, in popup, I should probably this._on( ... { "webkitAnimationEnd animationend" : ... } )
[10:48:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and set flags in the internal state that indicate whether I'm actually interested in the event, rather than continuously hooking up to it and hoping that it actually fires.
[10:48:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there is a session starting in a few minutes where i need to help people why dont we table this for now and talk more about it next week 
[10:49:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[10:49:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll add a comment to the PR.
[10:49:26] <arschmitz> thank you
[10:49:46] <arschmitz> its something we should address but make sure we do it consistently
[10:49:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[10:50:02] <arschmitz> might even be something for 1.4.1 since its not a regression
[10:50:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed.
