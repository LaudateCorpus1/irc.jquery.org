[04:55:00] <rxaviers> arschmitz, ping
[04:55:16] <arschmitz> rxaviers: Hi
[04:55:38] <rxaviers> I saw your comment about NFC and NFKC
[04:56:13] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yup i had to implement Unicode normalization when i made the jquery-pr checker
[04:56:28] <arschmitz> to get jzaefferer's name to parse correctly
[04:56:31] <arschmitz> :)
[04:56:34] <rxaviers> :D
[04:57:25] <arschmitz> rxaviers: i used https://github.com/walling/unorm/blob/master/src/unorm.js
[04:57:41] <rxaviers> checking
[04:58:45] <rxaviers> shooot. That I was afraid of
[04:58:53] <rxaviers> A huge lookup table hardcoded in the lib
[04:59:26] <arschmitz> yup
[04:59:44] <arschmitz> im not sure there is really another way from how i understand it works
[05:00:19] <arschmitz> which it sounds like was your fear also
[05:03:48] <rxaviers> But, it definitely helps me
[05:04:44] <rxaviers> it's a reference and references are good.
[05:04:47] <arschmitz> cool glad it took me almost a week to figure out what i needed with it the first time lol
[05:05:08] <arschmitz> because i just had some weird encoding no one seemed to know what was or how to decode lol
[05:05:10] <rxaviers> cldr mailist list folks also replied to my email. They gave me links to tons of more reading :'(
[05:05:57] <rxaviers> arschmitz, with that normalization you were able to map j√∂rn and joern being equal?
[05:06:09] <arschmitz> even mathais had no idea jzaefferer ended up sending it out in a tweet and someone was able to point me in the right direction 
[05:06:13] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yes
[05:06:37] <arschmitz> rxaviers: https://github.com/walling/unorm/blob/master/src/unorm.js
[05:06:40] <arschmitz> oops
[05:06:45] <arschmitz> https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-pr/blob/master/jquery-pr.js#L30
[05:06:57] <arschmitz> thats the full decode of his name

[05:07:05] <arschmitz> or any name encoded that way of course
[05:07:33] <rxaviers> intersting
[05:07:36] <rxaviers> interesting*
[05:08:19] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yeah it was essential for being able to compare names from the cla list to git patches 
[05:09:41] <arschmitz> rxaviers: checkout the second line https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/54004c85d02ba5688549736e0fb8f883c88b668b.patch
[05:10:23] <rxaviers> wow
[05:10:32] <arschmitz> yeah that was a challenge
[05:10:47] <rxaviers> this is crazy
[05:11:51] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yup
[05:19:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1383#issuecomment-53048930
[05:19:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I've noticed something interesting.
[05:19:53] <gabriel_schulhof> The non-URL-encoded version ends up in the location.
[05:20:23] <gabriel_schulhof> So, if you go to /100%test/index.html, the string "http://domain/path/to/100%test/index.html" ends up in the location.
[05:20:39] <arschmitz> ugh oh its not encoding it
[05:20:41] <gabriel_schulhof> If you then click on the location and click "Enter", You get a bad request, because 100%test is not a valid URL.
[05:21:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[05:21:21] <arschmitz> im kinda suprised it does not throw when you push the url
[05:21:22] <gabriel_schulhof> This is independent of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1383 though, I think.
[05:21:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[05:21:37] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or the browser's supposed to fix that.
[05:21:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Lemme see how FF behaves.
[05:22:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep. FF also break.
[05:22:35] <gabriel_schulhof> s
[05:23:00] <gabriel_schulhof> So, it's up to us to push a correct URL.
[05:23:23] <gabriel_schulhof> Man ... we really need to keep track of which values are encoded and which are not.
[05:23:25] <arschmitz> what happens if you just click an anchor with that link does it fail without jqm?
[05:23:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Good question.
[05:23:46] <gabriel_schulhof> I've set the href on the anchor to be URL encoded.
[05:24:03] <gabriel_schulhof> So, actually, if the href is URL-encoded, the resulting location should also be URL-encoded.
[05:24:10] <arschmitz> right
[05:24:12] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean the anchor href.
[05:24:33] <arschmitz> i knew what you meant
[05:24:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Man ... this whole thing is so ad-hoc.
[05:25:51] <gabriel_schulhof> We should, maybe, have a URL class.
[05:25:58] <gabriel_schulhof> A lot of frameworks have it.
[05:26:04] <gabriel_schulhof> But not right now ... 
[05:26:27] <gabriel_schulhof> $.mobile.path is already covering some of that territory.
[05:26:38] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: scott_gonzalez: an i were talking about consistent id -> selector encoding yesterday too
[05:27:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We already have one of those: $.mobile.path.hashToSelector
[05:27:28] <gabriel_schulhof> That's a bit badly named.
[05:27:38] <gabriel_schulhof> It should really be escapeSelector or something.
[05:27:42] <arschmitz> right this is not about just us and its part of something bigger and unrelated
[05:27:43] <gabriel_schulhof> ... it's not just for hashes.
[05:27:53] <arschmitz> ui does this in places too
[05:28:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[05:28:04] <gabriel_schulhof> I'd imagine they do.
[05:28:24] <arschmitz> there is a closed ticket to add it to core
[05:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's open.
[05:28:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, selector-encoding is a third kind of encoding after URL-encoding and entity-encoding.
[05:29:17] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and it's specific to core.
[05:29:28] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: oh sorry i thought it had been closed
[05:29:49] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14692
[05:29:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Thing is native has .matchesSelector, right?
[05:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> It's specific to CSS, not core.
[05:30:01] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Well, yeah, I was just getting to that.
[05:30:09] <gabriel_schulhof> ... what with .matchesSelector() 'n all.
[05:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> There's a spec for CSS.escape().
[05:30:24] <arschmitz> http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#the-css.escape()-method
[05:31:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Great .. seems pretty preliminary ...
[05:32:47] <gabriel_schulhof> ... anyway ... I need to shepherd the URL from anchor href to location.href.
[05:33:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: do you have a jsbin?
[05:34:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'd have to make it a jsfiddle, and I'm not sure I can get it to have the right file name.
[05:34:45] * gabriel_schulhof is working on it
[05:34:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the ajax issues with jsbin are fixed
[05:35:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, really? Cool!
[05:35:09] <arschmitz> i worked with remy early this week to fix it 
[05:35:29] <arschmitz> we need to add a workaround to our template though
[05:36:12] <arschmitz> we either need to add `.html` to the end or use ajax setup to blank out the `x-requested-with` header
[05:36:47] <arschmitz> .html will be suffecient for everything execpt certain path issues where we can use the header instead
[05:36:58] <gabriel_schulhof> I can only do the data-url part with jsbin. The part where a URL-encoded URL stored in an anchor href ends up unencoded in the location requires a github page.
[05:37:34] <arschmitz> just something where i can actually see the code involved
[05:37:55] <arschmitz> fiddle bin page whatever
[05:38:22] <gabriel_schulhof> The Ajax issues are still present on jsbin.
[05:39:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/1383/100%test/index.html
[05:39:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Oops!
[05:39:18] <gabriel_schulhof> http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/1383/weird-file-name.html
[05:40:12] <gabriel_schulhof> That's after fixing the exception mentioned in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1383#issuecomment-52808132
[05:41:02] <arschmitz> ok so if you click on 100%25test/index.html you get 100%test/index.html in the url bar?
[05:41:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes.
[05:41:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Which, upon deep-linking, causes a bad request.
[05:41:28] <arschmitz> right
[05:41:44] <gabriel_schulhof> So, that's where the shepherding comes in.
[05:42:03] <gabriel_schulhof> I need to create a scenario that produces this with code from master.
[05:42:20] <gabriel_schulhof> This is code from the fix for 1383 where I've already made some modifications to the way URLs are encoded.
[05:42:29] <gabriel_schulhof> I need to make sure that this is a separate issue.
[05:42:38] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hmm how is it getting there decoded
[05:42:45] <arschmitz> the href is supplied still encoded
[05:42:48] <gabriel_schulhof> That's the good question.
[05:42:49] <arschmitz> from the dom
[05:43:18] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm not sure, but since I've found this problem, I must make sure that it's also happening on master.
[05:43:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: http://jsbin.com/devatu/1
[05:44:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, yeah. Normally, the link ends up in the location encoded.
[05:45:33] <gabriel_schulhof> So, we need to make sure that's how it happens through our nav as well.
[05:46:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and look at the console .href  on the link is still encoded too
[05:46:39] <arschmitz> so we are decoding it for no good reason somewhere
[05:47:08] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I broke it.
[05:47:14] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: lol
[05:47:25] <gabriel_schulhof> It works on master, but it's broken on the 1383 branch.
[05:47:34] <arschmitz> ohhh.......
[05:47:49] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I need to write another test to make sure this does not happen.
[05:48:12] <arschmitz> seems like we need to come up with a more consistent way to process and handle the url
[05:48:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Amen.
[05:48:53] <gabriel_schulhof> We need to be aware of the points where we retrieve URLs from the native side (location, DOM, user input, whatever) and where we spit them out to the native side.
[05:49:03] <arschmitz> all the encoding decoding stuff you have been working on is a mess and it seems like it should not be this complicated  and more consistent
[05:49:19] <gabriel_schulhof> In-between we need to store the URLs in exactly one format.
[05:49:32] <gabriel_schulhof> That's what I've been trying to achieve.
[05:49:45] <gabriel_schulhof> Until now we've had no docs as to whether data-url should be encoded or not.
[05:50:14] <arschmitz> seems like it SHOULD always be encoded
[05:50:19] <arschmitz> everywhere
[05:50:35] <arschmitz> and we should then only decode where specificly needed
[05:51:02] <arschmitz> because most things we are going to do or care about will want the encoded url i think
[05:51:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmmm ... that's true. I guess when writing markup, you have to write your URLs encoded.
[05:52:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, the value of the href attribute is always url-encoded.
[05:52:45] <gabriel_schulhof> So, maybe I should do an about-turn on data-url. I was thinking that we should require that it not be URL-encoded.
[05:52:59] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and I wrote the fix for 1383 in anticipation of that.
[05:53:10] <arschmitz> where do we actually need it not encoded
[05:53:11] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but perhaps we should treat data-url like href.
[05:53:23] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm not sure.
[05:53:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Lemme check.
[05:54:27] <gabriel_schulhof> It seems like convertUrlToDataUrl() decodes.
[05:55:02] <arschmitz> right but we would likely change that if we made data-url always encoded
[05:56:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes, for sure.
[05:57:00] <gabriel_schulhof> However, when I first saw that, I figured "OK, so we want data-url to always be decoded. Fine! Then let's document it that way, and assume everywhere that it's decoded."
[05:57:11] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but now I'm thinking we should do the opposite.
[05:58:47] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. The decoding was done for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3630
[06:00:40] <arschmitz> well we dont support ios4
[06:00:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Man ... I'm not sure I wanna change it from being decoded then, because if I do, I have another kind of shepherding to do. I have to make sure it doesn't get double-encoded, re-introducing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3630
[06:01:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I hope that was a bug in iOS4.
[06:01:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Not a bug in our code that the OP happened to encounter on iOS4.
[06:01:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, that's easy to test.
[06:01:59] <arschmitz> yeah 
[06:02:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Nav from a page with a funky URL to a normal page and then go back. If what you get from hashchange is encoded, then the problem exists outside iOS4.
[06:02:52] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: nice that apparently this was landed with no history or discussion lol
[06:03:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, it was a simple enough fix.
[06:04:08] <gabriel_schulhof> The thing is though, looking at the PR at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3636 is that the URL is only decoded for the selector.
[06:04:17] <gabriel_schulhof> It's not actually decoded for storage in data-url
[06:04:36] <gabriel_schulhof> ... so, I guess, by that time it was already getting stored decoded.
[06:04:51] <arschmitz> yup
[06:05:06] <gabriel_schulhof> So, another (and more complicated) alternative to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3630 would have been to ensure that data-url is stored encoded.
[06:05:18] <gabriel_schulhof> ... which is what we must now do.
[06:05:28] <gabriel_schulhof> ... it seems.
[06:05:28] <arschmitz> right
[06:05:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Maaaan!
[06:05:43] <gabriel_schulhof> *whew*
[06:06:11] <arschmitz> i hate nav stuff like this there is always the edge case i cant think of that breaks
[06:06:48] <arschmitz> because event attempting to try to keep all of nav in your head is a failing battle lol
[06:07:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, and this is a whole other dimension of it.
[06:07:38] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean the sequence of events is complicated enough.
[06:07:46] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[06:07:59] <gabriel_schulhof> I think I will re-examine my fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1383 in light of this discussion.
[06:08:19] <arschmitz> ok let me know what you come up with
[06:09:03] <gabriel_schulhof> For now I'll go grab something from the kitchen, because all but my reptilian brain has shut down.

[11:09:38] <rxaviers> arschmitz, did you have any lucky automating tests via browserstack?
[11:10:04] <arschmitz> rxaviers: no i have not made it back to it recently though
[11:10:15] <rxaviers> ok thks
[11:10:24] <arschmitz> rxaviers: on the NFC stuff
[11:10:46] <arschmitz> rxaviers: i did a little more research and unorm is basicly the ONLY polyfill i could find for that
[11:11:00] <rxaviers> I really liked that
[11:11:12] <arschmitz> and the consensus in general is unless you cant avoid it its too big to be a reasonable polyfill
[11:11:30] <rxaviers> yeap :-S
[11:11:40] <arschmitz> but if you need it thats the way to go i guess
[11:11:51] <arschmitz> and encourage conditional loading 
[11:11:55] <arschmitz> ?
[11:12:52] <rxaviers> Considering its size, my next step there will be: trying to implement a very minimal/partial NFKC for the whitespaces and the whatelse-is-minimally-needed for the loose matching parsing.
[11:13:13] <arschmitz> rxaviers: im just not sure what alternative there is if you need it though if you saw my comment my project i can actually remove it from now :)
[11:13:28] <arschmitz> rxaviers: yeah maybe if you could narrow down the lookup table for just those things
[11:13:35] <rxaviers> yeap
[11:13:38] <arschmitz> save a lot of bytes
[11:13:39] <rxaviers> that'd be great
[11:14:03] <rxaviers> need to read more about it (eg. http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/) and see what can be done
[11:14:10] <rxaviers> But, you saved me a lot of time
[11:14:12] <rxaviers> :D
[11:14:17] <arschmitz> you dont need to worry about combining chars for globalize do you?
[11:14:31] <rxaviers> actually, I'm not sure.
[11:14:40] <rxaviers> The issue is only about no-break space vs. space.
[11:14:41] <arschmitz> because i believe thats what a good chunk of the table is 
[11:14:45] <arschmitz> its to sort those out
[11:15:07] <rxaviers> But, Im afraid this is the tip of the iceberg
[11:15:28] <arschmitz> yeah could be
[11:16:01] <rxaviers> and going deeper into the unicode docs are really fun :p
[11:17:02] <arschmitz> lol yeah that stuff is crazy i had a very hard time following must of what i was reading when i looked into it before

[12:25:27] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: what do I do first?
[12:25:31] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't look like it has a release script.
[12:26:16] <mikesherov> ha
[12:26:22] <mikesherov> yeah, it does not
[12:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> So, I guess there are a few questions.
[12:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> Do you just want to get a quick release out, or do you want to set everything up?
[12:27:14] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to publish to Bower?
[12:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to publish on the plugins site?
[12:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want it hosted on the CDN?
[12:29:47] <mikesherov> All I really want for now
[12:30:03] <mikesherov> is the ability to pull it into jquery-ui proper
[12:30:15] <mikesherov> via the same "external" process as the other externals
[12:30:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's just focus on the minimal necessary for that.
[12:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> We need to publish to Bower.
[12:31:30] <scott_gonzalez> Do you just want to publish the source file as is or did you want to tag from a detached head with a minified file as well?
[12:33:50] <mikesherov> I don't need minified
[12:33:57] <mikesherov> source as is with version replaced
[12:34:04] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[12:34:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, looks like `grunt max` might do that.
[12:35:15] <scott_gonzalez> Let's first make sure AUTHORS.TXT is up to date.
[12:35:20] <scott_gonzalez> Run `grunt authors`
[12:36:02] <mikesherov> doing...
[12:36:32] <scott_gonzalez> See if the last name matches AUTHORS.TXT
[12:37:47] <mikesherov> wow, looks like I have to update grunt first
[12:37:49] <mikesherov> so old
[12:40:15] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: bizarre
[12:40:19] <mikesherov> grunt authors says:
[12:40:26] <mikesherov> Mike Sherov <mike.sherov@gmail.com>
[12:40:27] <mikesherov> Scott Gonz√°lez <scott.gonzalez@gmail.com>
[12:40:28] <mikesherov> Andrei Picus <office.nightcrawler@gmail.com>
[12:40:29] <mikesherov> Lars Laade <lars.laade@googlemail.com>
[12:40:56] <mikesherov> AUTHORS.TXT says:
[12:40:56] <mikesherov> Authors ordered by first contribution
[12:40:58] <mikesherov> Richard D. Worth <rdworth@gmail.com>
[12:40:58] <scott_gonzalez> Because of the repo change.
[12:40:59] <mikesherov> Eduardo Lundgren <eduardolundgren@gmail.com>
[12:41:01] <mikesherov> Scott Gonz√°lez <scott.gonzalez@gmail.com>
[12:41:02] <mikesherov> Trey Hunner <treyhunner@gmail.com>
[12:41:02] <mikesherov> Mike Sherov <mike.sherov@gmail.com>
[12:41:03] <mikesherov> oh, right
[12:41:16] <mikesherov> so, I'll just add those other folks then
[12:41:20] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:43:03] <mikesherov> ok, added
[12:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so if you commit that and push to master, you should be ready to branch for the detached head tag, right?
[12:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> Just branch, update the version in package.json, source file, bower.json.
[12:44:12] <scott_gonzalez> commit and tag
[12:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> That should be everything, right?
[12:44:20] <mikesherov> I never did the detached head tag
[12:44:27] <mikesherov> I suppose that's everything
[12:44:31] <mikesherov> I never did this before
[12:45:01] <scott_gonzalez> The detached head is just for tagging with artifacts that you don't want to be in a branch.

[12:45:19] <jqcommit> 13jquery-simulate/06master 14cb480ab 15Mike Sherov: Build: Update AUTHORS.txt
[12:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> So you branch, make the changes that you don't want in master, commit, tag, push the tag, delete the branch.
[12:45:30] <mikesherov> I see
[12:45:47] <mikesherov> so what version should I do?
[12:45:55] <scott_gonzalez> I guess 1.0.0?
[12:46:00] <mikesherov> I suppose
[12:46:06] <mikesherov> hey, why not
[12:46:13] <mikesherov> it's only be around for 6 years
[12:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:47:01] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so I don't want to commit 1.0.0 in package.json to master?
[12:48:10] <scott_gonzalez> What you'll do is set it to 1.0.1-pre in master after you do the release.
[12:48:19] <mikesherov> I see
[12:48:34] <mikesherov> also, there are no changes I have to make to bower.json, right?
[12:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> I believe you just need to add the version.
[12:50:14] <scott_gonzalez> We should get this set up to use jquery-release before the next release.
[12:50:57] <mikesherov> yeah
[12:51:01] <mikesherov> I would like to
[12:51:11] <mikesherov> I don't see where a version number goes in bower.json
[12:51:40] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/bower.json#L3
[12:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> I just assume that's right.
[12:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> I've never published something to Bower.
[12:52:33] <mikesherov> ok then
[12:52:39] <mikesherov> jquery-ui doesn't have version number
[12:52:42] <mikesherov> so...
[12:52:47] <mikesherov> anyway, doing that now
[12:52:57] <scott_gonzalez> We don't publish to Bower.
[12:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> Someone else does.
[12:55:48] <jqcommit> [13jquery-simulate] 15mikesherov tagged 061.0.0 at 14e51d418: 02http://git.io/71ZZZQ
[12:55:48] <jqcommit> 13jquery-simulate/061.0.0 14e51d418 15Mike Sherov: Release: Version 1.0.0
[12:56:03] <mikesherov> ok then
[12:56:06] <mikesherov> that's released
[12:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:56:14] <mikesherov> :-)
[12:56:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what you need to do for Bower at this point.
[12:56:43] <mikesherov> I'll read the publishing to bower instructions
[12:56:48] <mikesherov> what do I do in master
[12:56:58] <mikesherov> I update the version number to 1.0.1-pre ?
[12:57:01] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> That's it.
[12:57:09] <mikesherov> in both package.json and bower.json?
[12:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> You can pobably just leave bower.json as is if you want.
[12:57:35] <mikesherov> ok, doing that now
[12:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> Since it doesn't have a version in it right now.
[12:58:30] <scott_gonzalez> Once you publish to bower, you can update jquery-ui's bower.json and the bower task in grunt.
[12:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> Just copy the license and source file, like the other bower deps.

[13:35:24] <mikesherov> OK, great
[13:35:39] <mikesherov> it appears someone had already registered jquery-simulate with bower
[13:35:41] <mikesherov> go figure
