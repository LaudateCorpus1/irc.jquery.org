[05:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: If the end wasn't a fast-forward, then you changed your local master, which you should never do.
[05:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: For #5901 there is a completely new classes API being worked on.
[05:05:10] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: API changes are never quick fixes ;-)
[05:11:57] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: effects rewrite is at 0.0.1
[05:12:20] <mikesherov> I have all effects rewritten to use clip and placeholder...
[05:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> awesome :-)
[05:12:36] <mikesherov> but only in chrome. I haven't tested elsewhere yet.
[05:12:51] <mikesherov> and I have some failing tests to deal with.
[05:13:03] <mikesherov> I also think the size effect, as is, is busted.
[05:13:25] <mikesherov> look at the scale effect demo: http://api.jqueryui.com/scale-effect/
[05:13:28] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #170: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/170/
[05:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> The show animation seems wrong.
[05:16:18] <petersendidit> mikesherov: switched to your version, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/895, should I merge it?
[05:16:19] <b-ot> petersendidit: Pull request #895 by petersendidit (2d 19h ago): Effects Core: make removeClass work correctly with changes jQuery 1.9.0....
[05:16:32] <mikesherov> petersendidit: so, you should be using the merge button
[05:16:36] <mikesherov> on github's interface
[05:16:42] <mikesherov> soudln't*
[05:16:45] <petersendidit> yea I know
[05:16:51] <mikesherov> ok, cool.
[05:17:01] <petersendidit> I did once and learned my leason. ;-)
[05:17:09] <scott_gonzalez> Don't merge yet.
[05:17:09] <mikesherov> So, yeah, looks good to me.
[05:17:41] <petersendidit> k
[05:17:48] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: also, open tests/visual/effects/all.html
[05:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> In the tests, we use `element`, not `el`
[05:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't say anything about the dialog pull requests because the other tests still have shitty code in them :-P
[05:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> But that's it, other than the variable name, you can merge.
[05:18:31] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you'll see that the size/scale effects are a bit janky
[05:18:59] <petersendidit> Ok
[05:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> scale seems a bit jittery and size toggle shows the same problem with the show animation.
[05:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> Holy crap, we should bump up the time for the shake animation.
[05:22:48] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: HA
[05:23:23] <mikesherov> so I wrote some more visual demos to account for margin-collapse and abs vs. rel, etc.
[05:23:38] <mikesherov> but those will get converted to unit tests if at all possible
[05:24:32] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:35:41] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Regarding that slider performance thread, I really don't want to use transforms in UI.
[05:35:49] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: me neither
[05:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> Can we just tell him that instead of encouraging him?
[05:36:08] <mikesherov> I also like how I was called out about abspos causing reflow when they clearly don't
[05:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[05:36:21] <mikesherov> I haven't encouraged him
[05:36:35] <mikesherov> have I?
[05:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> Not intentionally :-P
[05:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> But not cutting him off right away and responding to him twice will be seen as encouragement by him.
[05:38:28] <gnarf> what thread is this?
[05:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> Some guy sent an email to me, Mike and Dominic Barnes about using transforms in slider.
[05:39:27] <scott_gonzalez> For the handle animations.
[05:40:23] <gnarf> oh - like actually animating/setting transform to set the posision on the sliders?
[05:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:41:42] <gnarf> yeah, i don't think that needs to happen
[05:41:50] <gnarf> left/width should cover it right?
[05:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/d0d66eb620b1880c30f6
[05:44:12] <scott_gonzalez> That's his change.
[05:44:41] <scott_gonzalez> He didn't even send a patch, he sent a modified version of 1.8.23.
[05:45:21] <mikesherov> so, we can use that when we stop supporting IE8
[05:45:25] <gnarf> + tons-o-code, no real difference in functionality?
[05:45:27] <mikesherov> and jQuery <1.8
[05:45:33] <mikesherov> gnarf: perf boost
[05:45:48] <mikesherov> in all fairness, it's so mobile can use slider
[05:46:05] <mikesherov> apparently, top/left perf is horrendous because of repaint
[05:46:24] <mikesherov> and maybe reflow, but I'm not sure I understand how reflow can be effecting it
[05:47:05] <mikesherov> oh, it's using translate3d? that's not even in IE10
[05:47:37] <gnarf> I'm pretty sure you could plugin on top of slider for that
[05:47:45] <mikesherov> yes
[05:47:51] <mikesherov> I was just thinking the same thing
[05:48:28] <mikesherov> What we may want to be is abstract out top/left
[05:48:29] <mikesherov> so that people can create custom top/left setters

[07:30:55] <boulet101010> Hi, i'm trying to create a resizable box. The bug is that when i set a containment, the box can't enlarge to the whole container, for example, in a 250px height container, i can only go up to 246px with the resizable box.
[07:31:21] <boulet101010> using 1.9.2
[07:41:40] <boulet101010> tested in 1.10.0, same bug.
[07:43:13] <scott_gonzalez> boulet101010: Please check if there is already a bug filed at http://bugs.jqueryui.com
[07:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> If there isn't, please file one along with a reduced test case showing the problem.
[07:46:57] <boulet101010> there already is one, and i found how to fix it. needed to position relative the containment element.
[07:47:04] <boulet101010> thx anyway

[09:35:20] <djQuery>  scott_gonzalez earlier I was mentioning a plug i was writing that removed the stock close button and allows the creation of several buttons there
[09:36:07] <djQuery> should I submit a bug and pull request to create a seperate private functino for creating the close button
[09:36:23] <djQuery> this would make my plugin a lot easier
[09:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> No bug, just a PR.
[09:37:23] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/ukixuc/9/edit  need to come up with a new name for it though
[09:37:35] <scott_gonzalez> Well, actually, yeah, you can file a ticket for that.
[09:39:02] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, cool , dang David.Sullivan login is broken
[09:52:00] <nicofrand> hi
[09:54:12] <nicofrand> I am using a plugin which extends $.datepicker and uses $.datepicker.log. However, between the 1.9.2 and the 1.10.0 versions of jQuery UI, the $.datepicker.log method has been removed. I can't find any blog post, upgrade guide or anything that says that this method was deprecatedâ€¦ Any help guys ?
[09:55:20] <scott_gonzalez> nicofrand: Was $.datepicker.log ever documented?
[09:56:18] <nicofrand> does not seem so. But if I have to write the plugin author to remove the calls to this method, I think that would be nice to attach a link to a "you should not use $.datepicker.log"
[09:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> nicofrand: There's a general rule that applies to everything released by the jQuery teams.
[09:57:06] <nicofrand> if such a link exists, of course (which is the root of my question).
[09:57:12] <scott_gonzalez> If it's not documented, it can go away with no warning.
[09:57:35] <scott_gonzalez> $.datepicker.log is not a supported API.
[09:57:38] <nicofrand> ok ok
[09:57:49] <nicofrand> thanks
[09:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> I assume you're not having a functionality issue, just an error that the function doesn't exist?
[09:58:44] <scott_gonzalez> If so, you can just add a dummy function until the plugin author releases an update.
[09:58:48] <scott_gonzalez> $.datepicker.log = $.noop
[09:59:39] <nicofrand> yes I know, thank you
[11:07:15] <djQuery> do we have a method of doing speed tests?
[11:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: This was actually being discussed less than an hour ago in #jquery-dev.
[11:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have anything in jquery-ui.
[11:11:51] <djQuery> qunit doesnt have a method at all?
[11:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:14:25] <djQuery> I cant just do all the creation of the buttons outside of the equals and set a start date and end date, then have the equals compare the difference between the 2?
[11:15:21] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you trying to put a speed test inside QUnit?
[11:16:19] <djQuery> bug 5454
[11:16:41] <djQuery> large html slow to create buttons
[11:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> There shouldn't be a unit test for that.
[11:17:51] <djQuery> makes my job easier
[11:18:15] <djQuery> still need to do something to verify that my changes make any changes in the performance
[11:19:02] <djQuery> check to see if parent = label   in this case the for="checkboxid" may not be present
[11:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: We don't support that.
[12:52:57] <gnarf> kborchers: you around?
[12:53:15] <kborchers> gnarf: yo
[12:53:22] <gnarf> kborchers: I have had a request to obtain some more red hat stickers for a few friends
[12:54:00] <gnarf> can you pack some with you for .to? 
[12:55:20] <kborchers> gnarf: i have to see what i have left â€¦ i'm sure i have a bunch of the little shadow man stickers but i may be out of the bigger ones
[12:55:29] <kborchers> i'll bring what ever i have
[12:55:33] <gnarf> kborchers: the little one is the one in demand
[12:55:35] <gnarf> so this is luck
[12:55:41] <kborchers> cool
[12:57:11] <kborchers> gnarf: gotta love bringing you stickers in another country instead of 1.5 hours down the road :D
[12:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> I always thought you two lived closer. Didn't realize it was >1hr drive.
[12:59:07] <gnarf> kborchers: yup!
[12:59:09] <DaveMethvin> psssh, in Texas that's called "next door"
[12:59:18] <kborchers> heh
[12:59:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it's pretty close, still a bit of a drive, its <1hr if you're a 18 year old with a lead foot tho, all interstate ;)
[13:00:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: http://goo.gl/maps/lBI7w
[13:01:17] <gnarf> 88 is such a nice road too
[13:02:10] <kborchers> gnarf: except the one time i went to the rockford js meetup and it was under construction for half of the trip and only 1 lane doing 45 mph
[13:02:50] <gnarf> kborchers: :/
[13:16:48] <scott_gonzalez> What's the deal with these tweets? http://twitter.com/sagusiloho/status/296359964723793920
[13:16:49] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: @sagusiloho: Grr, why isn't the JQueryUI theme builder working.  I need to create some themes.
[13:16:53] <scott_gonzalez> They're all exactly the same wording.
[13:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> I've seen at least of dozen of them.
[13:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> Seemingly random people at random times, with exact same words.
[13:23:33] <djQuery> can I get some stickers too? http://goo.gl/a5Aap
[13:23:37] <petersendidit> what would the expected value of the of a slider be if you changed from range: true to range: "min" ?
[13:23:58] <petersendidit> Would you go from [2, 40] to just [ 2 ] ?
[13:27:29] <tj_vantoll> Well the "value" would be 2 right?
[13:27:29] <bot-t> (45 hours 30 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell tj_vantoll http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9015 should've been the ticket that got closed as it's the newer one.
[13:27:59] <gnarf> djQuery: you chi-town area too? or was the goo link to our map just a mistake? :)
[13:28:28] <petersendidit> sure. but what about "values"?
[13:28:49] <petersendidit> do you drop the other value because you went from 2 handles to 1 handle?
[13:29:20] <petersendidit> If so which handle do you drop?
[13:29:32] <djQuery> gnarf, no it lost the additional directions to Dallas TX
[13:30:11] <tj_vantoll> I would expect nothing to come back from $('#slider').slider('option', 'values').  And yes I would expect the numerically lower handle to be dropped.
[13:30:22] <tj_vantoll> And vice versa for changing to "max".
[13:30:41] <djQuery> petersendidit, well if you told it min then you would drop all handles but the lowest value one 
[13:45:43] <djQuery> i cnat seem to find any documentation on buttonset   anymore
[13:46:17] <djQuery> wasnt there a buttonset exmple with icons
[15:30:41] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: do you have a document with the list of goals for the slider API redesign?
[18:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Sounds invalid :-)
[18:17:45] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: No, slider is one of the few plugins we haven't done an initial design for.
[18:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> Our notes are limited to: "Split into 3 plugins: slider (single thumb), rangeSlider, multiSlider (any number of thumbs, even 1)"
[19:39:19] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: you around?
[22:23:37] <gnarf> kborchers: google tells me to wish you a happy birthday so, yeah ;)
[22:40:26] <djQuery> petersendidit, didn't some guy already do a lot of work on slider with multiple values and not allowing slide buttons to overlad and all that
[22:40:37] <djQuery> his notes are in one of the bugs
