[11:42:30] <intrepidcoder> arschmitz, for the update touch gestures to use Hammer.js project, are the custom touch events in the vmouse.js file?
[11:43:28] <intrepidcoder> I am interested in this project. Would you help direct me as to where the custom events are located? Thank you.
[12:14:39] <arschmitz> intrepidcoder: they are in events/touch.js
[12:15:01] <arschmitz> this uses touch uses vmouse though
[12:21:33] <mr_kitten> arschmitz, for the Native Select Button project, should I perhaps first show some Js mockups?
[12:21:58] <arschmitz> mr_kitten: there is already a beginning implementation
[12:22:08] <arschmitz> its really more about solving the many problems with it
[12:22:20] <arschmitz> mostly based around accessability
[12:22:43] <arschmitz> and adding in a way to automatticly decide if it should show the native vs custom menu based on device capabilities
[12:23:50] <mr_kitten> May I please know where these issues are being tracked?
[12:32:03] <mr_kitten> arschmitz, something like - if the device is touch based, the selectmenu should show the native behavior, but when on a pointer based device, the present custom version is fine
[12:32:20] <arschmitz> close but not quite
[12:33:07] <arschmitz> its actually about if the ux is going to be better with native
[12:33:19] <arschmitz> which is based around usage of softkeyboard 
[12:33:40] <arschmitz> there is a way to detect this based on multiselects
[12:34:17] <arschmitz> i dont have it handy this second but check with me this week i can get you the link to the prototype
[12:34:32] <mr_kitten> Yes
[12:34:36] <mr_kitten> Sure
[12:36:17] <mr_kitten> From what I've come across, on touch-based devices, the standard ux pattern for a select dropdown is to pop open a modal box with a scrollable list of all the options
[12:36:23] <mr_kitten> Am I correct?
[13:04:47] <arschmitz> mostly yes
[13:10:42] <mr_kitten> arschmitz, from what I've seen, the select button that is a part of jquery-mobile has the ARIA feature disabled
[13:10:46] <mr_kitten> why is that?
[13:11:55] <mr_kitten> the native select menu, i mean
[13:12:19] <mr_kitten> the custom select menu is detected by screenreaders
[13:32:22] <intrepidcoder> Thanks. For testing purposes, is an actual touch screen important or will the testing suite suffice?
[13:33:53] <intrepidcoder> I have mobile devices, but not a variety.
[13:44:40] <intrepidcoder> Hello, gabrielschulhof. I am interested on working on the jQuery Mobile "Update touch gestures to use Hammer.js" project.
[13:45:03] <intrepidcoder> I was just asking whether an actual touch screen is important or will the testing suite suffice?
[15:40:05] <intrepidcoder> I'm trying to add a depencency to Hammer.js. I added the file at external/hammerjs/hammer.js and added a shim under js/requirejs.config.js but it's not working.
[15:40:12] <intrepidcoder> How do I do this correctly?
[15:51:10] <intrepidcoder> Actually, I don't think I need a shim as Hammer is AMD. But I added "hammer": "../external/hammerjs/hammer" to the paths object in requrejs.config.js and it still doesn't work.
[16:34:08] <intrepidcoder> arschmitz: How can I add a depencency to Hammer.js using requirejs?
