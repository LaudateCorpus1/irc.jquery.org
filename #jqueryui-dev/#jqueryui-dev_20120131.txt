[08:02:13] <jzaefferer> yep
[08:02:41] <kborchers> can you send that link to that forum post again. my history doesn't show it here at work if my home IRC client grabs it
[08:04:53] <kborchers> jzaefferer: nevermind. i found it searching the forum

[08:11:20] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer: do we have a plan for Menubar as far as a version to release it with? It is not anywhere on the Roadmap nor does it have a release version on its wiki page. Are we thinking at least 1.10? 2.0?

[08:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[08:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> I just got kicked off the Touch Event Telcon :-P
[08:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> Today's meeting is W3C member confidential...
[08:17:38] <kborchers> that wasn't very nice of them. you should probably continuously call back in until they let you stay
[08:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> Heh
[08:21:04] <jzaefferer> how do you become a w3c member?
[08:23:07] <kborchers> by calling until they let you stay ... like i said :P
[08:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure.
[08:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> But there is this: trackbot: Created ACTION-93 - Get Scott Gonzalez added as an Invited Expert [on Doug Schepers - due 2012-02-07].
