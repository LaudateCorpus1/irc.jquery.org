[07:19:32] <orange_> hi all
[07:21:44] <orange_> does anybody know why jquery mobile do not work with jquery 2.0 and higher?
[07:22:46] <arschmitz> orange_: because 2.0 was not released yet when mobile 1.3.1 was
[07:27:48] <orange_> @arschmitz: ok. but it works with jquery 1.9 and jQuery 1.9 and 2.0 almost equivalent (except support of old IE version)
[07:28:20] <arschmitz> orange_: they are "almost" equivalent almost being the key word there
[07:28:57] <arschmitz> orange_: this is already fixed in master 
[07:29:13] <orange_> :)
[07:29:40] <orange_> do you know about release date? :)
[07:29:58] <orange_> of new version
[07:30:07] <arschmitz> 1.4 alpha will be some time in the begining of july
[07:30:29] <arschmitz> final probably about a month after that
[07:30:39] <orange_> I see
[07:30:46] <orange_> thank you
[07:30:53] <arschmitz> orange_: your welcome

[08:45:05] <uGoMobi> gnarf: thanks for setting up the redirect from #jquerymobile-dev !
[08:46:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: morning
[08:46:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hey Alex
[08:46:23] <uGoMobi> morning
[08:47:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i never got specificly what you needed for test devices so i could be on the lookout for them?
[08:49:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will have to look into what we already have (project and personally) first
[08:49:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok
[08:50:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i managed to get a free motorola Xoom tablet this morning running 4.0.4
[08:50:25] <uGoMobi> cool!
[08:50:38] <arschmitz> yeah person just didnt want it any more
[08:51:03] <arschmitz> i seem to have good luck with free androids lol
[08:51:13] <uGoMobi> so you said okay no problem :)
[08:51:17] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:51:28] <arschmitz> exactly
[08:51:37] <uGoMobi> that BB dev device doesn't seem to work btw
[08:51:43] <arschmitz> Bummer!
[08:51:53] <uGoMobi> it keeps restarting as soon as you do something
[08:52:03] <arschmitz> thats a bummer
[08:52:16] <arschmitz> maybe jason will know something to try on it 
[08:52:36] <uGoMobi> will give it another try, otherwise see if Jason can get us another device
[08:53:01] <arschmitz> yeah sadly he said the one i have will eventually probably stop working as well
[08:53:33] <uGoMobi> he already looked into it a second time at the conf, but didn't work out
[08:53:45] <arschmitz> that stinks
[08:53:57] <arschmitz> you would think for dev phones they would just sim lock them 
[08:54:06] <arschmitz> not have them expire
[08:54:17] <uGoMobi> right
[08:56:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just found a z10 for $380 in my town
[08:56:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats actually a really good deal
[08:56:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it is
[08:56:37] <uGoMobi> but let's ask Jason first before we spend money
[08:56:47] <arschmitz> oh of course i was just saying
[08:56:51] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[08:58:21] <fnagel> UI meeting today?
[08:58:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually i just found a z10 for $150 even
[08:59:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: wot :O
[08:59:15] <uGoMobi> that can't be right
[08:59:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: though it would be a funny deal they want to trade for an s3 which i can get for $150
[08:59:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they hate the z10 and just want an s3 
[08:59:36] <uGoMobi> i see
[09:00:00] <arschmitz> great deal for the person with the s3 lol
[09:00:14] <uGoMobi> yeah
[09:01:24] <arschmitz> an s3 would be good to have too its the most common android phone right now
[09:01:51] <uGoMobi> I agree
[09:02:20] <uGoMobi> are they running 4.1?
[09:02:28] <arschmitz> i dont have a 4.1 or 4.2 phone either
[09:02:29] <uGoMobi> or upgrade to 4.2 already?
[09:02:30] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: meeting time?
[09:02:48] <uGoMobi> I have a Galaxy Nexus running 4.2
[09:03:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: 4.1 still
[09:03:14] <arschmitz> going to release 4.2 update in fall it looks like
[09:03:20] <uGoMobi> a Samsung Android device running 4.0/4.1 would be useful addition
[09:03:32] <fnagel> mikesherov: seems not? Last spreadsheet entry is two weeks ago
[09:03:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can get an s3 on 4.1 for $150 seems like it would be worth it
[09:04:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: agreed
[09:04:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not very likely we can get it for free or less
[09:04:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok ill look into getting one 
[09:04:53] <uGoMobi> great
[09:04:55] <gnarf> fnagel: scott is out - jzaefferer ping?
[09:05:12] <arschmitz> yeah androids unless its just from someone you know that does not want it are pretty hard to get free
[09:05:32] <arschmitz> i have 3 free ones but all old ones from friends or family
[09:05:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how much for a used iPhone 4S there?
[09:05:36] <fnagel> gnarf: I already did, no response. I know he was missing the meeting last few weeks
[09:05:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill check right nbow
[09:06:15] <fnagel> Should we change to #jquery-meeting?
[09:06:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i found one for $180
[09:06:58] <uGoMobi> oh that isn't too bad either
[09:07:03] <arschmitz> you need one?
[09:07:22] <arschmitz> also one very unlikely to get for free
[09:07:23] <uGoMobi> well I have an iPad Retina
[09:07:33] <arschmitz> yeah and there are difference
[09:07:45] <uGoMobi> was about to say that
[09:07:55] <arschmitz> iv been working on a bug thats iphone only on api sites
[09:08:04] <uGoMobi> yeah saw that
[09:08:12] <uGoMobi> the scroll thing
[09:08:16] <arschmitz> yup
[09:08:21] <uGoMobi> when you hit the clock
[09:08:25] <arschmitz> exactly
[09:09:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can add that to my list of devices to get and ship it out to you if you want?
[09:10:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok great
[09:10:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: should make an overview?
[09:10:58] <uGoMobi> for you _|Nix|_ and me
[09:11:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not sure what you mean
[09:11:28] <uGoMobi> overview of what we have and need
[09:11:34] <arschmitz> oh oh yeah
[09:11:41] <uGoMobi> just so we don't get the same things
[09:12:00] <arschmitz> i have a list of all the ones that the foundation has ill add a list of personal ones to it ?
[09:12:19] <uGoMobi> yeah sound good
[09:12:21] <arschmitz> might as well keep the lists together
[09:12:35] <arschmitz> yeah im bummed i bought same WP8 as you
[09:12:48] <arschmitz> i swear i thought you had the 920
[09:13:14] <arschmitz> :(
[09:13:31] <arschmitz> but perfect example of why having it written down would be good
[09:13:43] <uGoMobi> I have iPad Retina running iOS6.1, Galaxy Nexus running 4.2, Nokia Lumia 520 WP8, LG L3 Android 2.3.6
[09:13:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: exactly
[09:14:08] <uGoMobi> maybe _|Nix|_ can get a 920
[09:14:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think hes going to try to get a samsung or htc one
[09:14:32] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:14:34] <arschmitz> better spread then all lumias
[09:14:43] <uGoMobi> true
[09:15:04] <arschmitz> if id known i would have got an htc 8x found on for like $180
[09:15:18] <arschmitz> i got the $520 for only $150 though so its still not a bad get
[09:15:43] <uGoMobi> mine was 170 euro
[09:16:08] <uGoMobi> it seems like it's gonna be a very popular device
[09:16:27] <uGoMobi> was sold out before they started shipping
[09:16:37] <arschmitz> yeah i only paid 112 euro so really good deal lol
[09:16:53] <arschmitz> yeah its actually higher rated then the way more expensive 920
[09:17:40] <arschmitz> the 520 is probably going the be the most popular phone of the first gen of WP8 i would say
[09:18:09] <uGoMobi> I think so too
[09:18:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was checking out lists of most popular androids 
[09:18:20] <arschmitz> we need a kindle fire!
[09:18:22] <uGoMobi> smartphone for the price of feature phone
[09:18:31] <arschmitz> its like #3 on the list and has a different browser
[09:18:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, thought about that one
[09:18:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but Filament has one
[09:19:17] <arschmitz> i wonder if they have the regular or hd
[09:19:24] <uGoMobi> hd i think
[09:19:29] <arschmitz> or both i know they have a few different kindles
[09:19:48] <uGoMobi> but if you can get one cheap it might be useful indeed
[09:19:58] <arschmitz> yeah ill keep an eye out
[09:20:06] <uGoMobi> was thinking same about nexus 7 tablet
[09:20:21] <arschmitz> the other popular tablets are the nexus 7 and galaxy tab 2
[09:20:26] <arschmitz> lol 
[09:20:40] <uGoMobi> :)
[09:20:59] <arschmitz> the other one i saw that made sense we might want if i can get a cheap one is a note 2
[09:21:15] <arschmitz> by far most popular device in korea and very popular in US too
[09:21:59] <arschmitz> and korea is our #1 market
[09:23:40] <uGoMobi> time to get out of bed and get some coffee
[09:23:58] <arschmitz> lol weird having you behind me
[09:24:06] <arschmitz> normally your way ahead
[09:24:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: crazy coincidence so you were right in front of me on plane to portland scott gonzalez was right next to me on way back
[09:27:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: haha
[09:28:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: a Note might be good to have indeed
[09:28:38] <uGoMobi> crazy big phone, would never buy that myself
[09:28:42] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:28:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah bet thats a harder one to find cheap but ill keep an eye out
[09:28:53] <arschmitz> i agree i wouldnt want it
[09:29:07] <arschmitz> but my step father and a few people i work with have them and think they are the best ever
[09:30:03] <uGoMobi> okay, now I am really leaving
[09:30:08] <uGoMobi> have a good one
[09:30:13] <arschmitz> lol take it easy
[09:31:22] <tj_vantoll> Could someone else try this test case out: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9383. The poster says that a secondary click closes the datepicker, but I'm not seeing it, and I'm also confused… because I'm pretty sure we don't do anything special there.
[09:43:50] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: Just tried that and i cant reproduce either
[09:44:55] <tj_vantoll> Ok, thanks for the sanity check arschmitz.
[09:45:37] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: also i was working with that datepicker on something for last 2 days
[09:45:53] <arschmitz> and i right clicked to inspect dozens and dozens of times and it does not do anything 
[09:46:50] <tj_vantoll> Excellent, good to know. I saw your datepicker jsbin btw, nicely done.
[09:47:23] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: thanks its just wraps the ui one into a mobile widget but will be a nice stop gap until date picker is refactored
[09:47:57] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, I'm going to be helping with the rewrite actually, just starting looking into that last night.
[09:48:19] <arschmitz> yeah jzaefferer: asked for my input on it as well for mobile
[09:49:14] <arschmitz> will be great the current date picker works but its a bit of a beast lol 
[09:49:37] <tj_vantoll> Absolutely. jzaefferer and others have a pretty decent start on the rewrite in a branch. Biggest problem is the branch is using templates to build the HTML; I'm going to be working on refactoring those into the widget code itself.
[09:49:54] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: nice 
[09:50:52] <arschmitz> good think there too is functionality does not really need to be any different on mobile just style really
[09:52:16] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: one thing though with the current one that would be nice if it was different on mobile is if inline was an option rather then calling it on a div instead of input
[09:53:01] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I've never really liked how that worked.
[09:53:17] <arschmitz> yeah i think inline should just make an inline calendar after the input
[09:53:35] <arschmitz> having to set an alt field and call on div is weird
[09:53:37] <tj_vantoll> Seems like there could be a calendar widget and a datepicker widget.
[09:54:11] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: yeah datepicker would essentially be an extension of calendar
[09:54:24] <arschmitz> that ties it to the input
[09:54:48] <tj_vantoll> I talked with jzaefferer a bit about this. Problem is there's a lot of keyboard dependencies between the input and the calendar.
[09:55:06] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: i actually like that idea a lot if it was workable
[09:55:17] <tj_vantoll> I guess the datepicker could add handlers to its associated calendar though to handle for that.
[09:55:48] <tj_vantoll> It's definitely tricky to implement, the API would be way cleaner though.
[09:56:16] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: yeah with the newer widget factory versions with super it should not be too too bad i dont think but easy to say that before you try it lol
[09:57:17] <tj_vantoll> Instead of an inline option, we could write it as a calendar that optionally has an input. And maybe an alwaysShow option or something. Dunno.
[09:58:05] <tj_vantoll> The current inline option is definitely weird though.
[09:58:27] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: yeah they key for mobile is in general options can only be strings because of auto init they generally come from data attributes
[09:58:39] <arschmitz> so anything that works off a callback does not work well
[09:59:16] <tj_vantoll> Hmmm, that's another thing that will be interesting for the UI / mobile merger. We definitely have lots of options that are not just strings.
[10:00:02] <tj_vantoll> The other datepicker/calendar fun thing for mobile will be datepickers that show multiple months at once.
[10:00:38] <tj_vantoll> That's a pretty common use case and I don't know how we'd handle that on mobile. Drop calendars that don't fit on the screen or something.
[10:00:55] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: things dont have to be 100% the same anyway
[10:01:04] <arschmitz> every ui widget will have an extension for mobile
[10:01:16] <tj_vantoll> True.
[10:02:14] <arschmitz> to add autoinit so if there are options that just dont work we can remove them with the extension
[10:02:34] <arschmitz> or change them in some way
[10:02:46] <arschmitz> would be pretty specific to the option and widget how to handle that
[10:03:12] <arschmitz> but that way we share the base code and just make minor adjustments as needed 
[10:03:28] <tj_vantoll> Makes sense.
[10:04:00] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: and with any luck in most cases wont need anything besides to extend them with the mobile base widget 
[10:04:30] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: in 1.4 we are adding ui tabs and only takes 3 lines to make it work and no ui core or css
