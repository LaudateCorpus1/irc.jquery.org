[05:53:45] <_ramo> hi
[05:54:48] <_ramo> i've created an account on trac to post a bug, but if i submit the form, it says: Submission rejected as potential spam  (Akismet says content is spam)
[05:55:30] <_ramo> the content was: http://privatepaste.com/a878e191b4/asfasfd
[05:55:46] <_ramo> so nothing strange i wrote down. it's referring to the jquery ui autocomplete plugin
[06:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> Are you a registered user?
[06:02:40] <scott_gonzalez> Also, it sounds like http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7024
[06:05:02] <_ramo> scott_gonzalez: exactly... this is the same behaviour i've seen here...
[06:06:14] <_ramo> i have to try build in the workaround... can i just add this into a <script> tag or how do i have to process it?
[06:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> If we knew a workaround, we would have implemented it already.
[06:17:45] <_ramo> so the pull request in not really a workaround?
[06:27:22] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I'll have to look at that PR again
[06:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> You can try the changes locally and see if it works for you.
[06:43:53] <_ramo> scott_gonzalez: i have to modify the jquery-ui . js file?
[06:44:16] <scott_gonzalez> You could do that.
[06:44:34] <scott_gonzalez> Or you can use git to pull a fresh copy and then merge in the changes from the PR.
[06:45:42] <_ramo> scott_gonzalez: i don't use git... just svn
[06:45:52] <_ramo> so just the first option is one for me, right?
[06:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:10:28] <Ponchale> hi
[07:10:31] <Ponchale> hallo
[07:10:32] <Ponchale> hola
[07:14:15] <kborchers> bonjour (sorry, couldn't resist) :P
[07:16:49] <Ponchale> I need help
[07:17:25] <kborchers> Ponchale: help is in #jquery, this is the development channel
[07:18:00] <Ponchale> :O
[07:18:03] <Ponchale> thans
[08:05:53] <_ramo> scott_gonzalez: do you know where to get the un-uglified version of jquery-ui  the current version?
[08:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com/download
[08:07:01] <_ramo> I#ve looked into this workaround: https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/d77d01c0e91fd2a10e9848618a307796381d4f86  butthe dude modified jquery.ui.autocomplete.js and jquery.ui.menu.js  but i have just the jquery-ui 1.8.xx version
[08:07:02] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by kborchers (8m, 3w ago): Autocomplete: Added check to determine if menu has just been created to override mouseover event and reset that variable from autocomplete on close. Fixed #7024 - Autocomplete menu options are activated even if mouse is not moved
[08:09:05] <_ramo> the versions are all modified...
[08:09:45] <_ramo> i mean minified
[08:19:02] <scott_gonzalez> look in the development-bundle directory
[08:24:42] <_ramo> scott_gonzalez: you mean: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/zipball/1.8.17 ?
[08:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> No.
[08:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> I mean jqueryui.com/download
[08:25:18] <scott_gonzalez> Download it and look in the development-bundle directory.
[08:26:15] <_ramo> ah okay... and how to integrate this into my project?  is the minfied version a sum of all files in the development-bundle dir?
[08:27:01] <scott_gonzalez> There's a concatenated file in there already.
[08:28:22] <scott_gonzalez>  /development-bundle/ui/jquery-ui-1.8.17.custom.js
[08:28:33] <_ramo> yeah
[08:28:33] <_ramo> found it
[08:28:41] <_ramo> thanks
[08:28:50] <_ramo> i'll built in the modifications and see what happens
[08:34:18] <_ramo> i can't find: .bind( "mouseover.menu", function( event ) { to add the green marked lines in jquery-ui-1.8.17.custom.js in directory development-bundle/ui , any hints what to do?
[08:39:42] <_ramo> does autocomplete menu exists anymore?
[08:43:42] <_ramo> this "workaround" isn't easily applicable for the current version scott_gonzalez , not for me.. i don't know where to do that changes desccribeb in the git pull... the files described doesn't match the current jquery-ui-1.8.17.custom.js files
[08:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's not going to match. The PR is against master, not 1-8-stable.
[08:46:47] <_ramo> okay, than i'll look at the current master
[08:53:12] <_ramo> scott_gonzalez: the same. i've downloaded the tarball from master, and looked in jquery.ui.menu.js for the line:  .bind( "mouseover.menu", function( event ) {   this is not found in the file from the current master , nor  the other lines, except position: { ....
[08:58:54] <_ramo> ah, the corresponding lines should be this: http://privatepaste.com/738cb1e1e1/sdfheh
[09:01:30] <_ramo> if ( self.options.disabled || self.options.isNewMenu ) {  self.options from the PR is  defined, how to rewrite this?
[09:02:05] <_ramo> this instead of self
[09:02:40] <kborchers> _ramo: let's start over ... i think you're digging yourself into a hole
[09:03:46] <_ramo> kborchers: i've downloaded https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/zipball/master
[09:04:16] <_ramo> and tried to adapt the changes you've made in jquery.ui.menu.js
[09:04:24] <_ramo> to the current jquery.ui.menu.js file
[09:05:06] <kborchers> ok, i thought you are having an issue with autocomplete ... further down in that ticket you would get to a different PR that does not touch menu
[09:05:16] <kborchers> you should not be modifying menu
[09:05:31] <_ramo> oh... i took the last post in http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7024
[09:05:36] <kborchers> you should be using 1.8.17 since that is the latest stable release, not 1.9
[09:05:37] <_ramo> kborchers: i have an issue with autocomplete
[09:05:56] <_ramo> i have the same issue as described: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7024 with the latest stable
[09:06:11] <_ramo> this focus issue when the mouse resist on the updated result list
[09:06:24] <kborchers> ok, so at the bottom of that ticket it takes you to pull 280, which was closed. then in that pull, there is a link to pull 288 which is what you should be working off of
[09:07:11] <_ramo> ah... didn't see that one :/
[09:07:14] <kborchers> specifically, you should be merging this commit https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/6e076e28e14772ddd88066b7ac46353e83d222c2 into jquery.ui.autocomplete.js in 1.8.17
[09:07:15] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by kborchers (6m, 2w ago): Autocomplete: Added check to determine if menu has just been created to override unintended mouseover event and reset that variable when closed. Fixed #7024 - Autocomplete menu options are activated even if mouse is not moved
[09:08:05] <_ramo> okay, i'll try that
[09:10:42] <_ramo> kborchers: can i modify the same things in the concantenated file?
[09:11:26] <_ramo> that should work to
[09:12:43] <kborchers> _ramo: yes, it'll make it a little harder to find what you're looking for but you can modify that file with these changes
[09:16:50] <_ramo> kborchers: does that fully fix the issue?
[09:17:05] <_ramo> it doesn't seem to me
[09:17:33] <kborchers> couldn't tell you. it seemed to fix it back when i submitted the PR but haven't looked at it in months.
[09:17:57] <_ramo> let me delete my cache
[09:19:47] <_ramo> hm, it's strange:
[09:20:55] <_ramo> if i delete more than 10 characters from a search string, the result list does not appear anymore
[09:21:14] <_ramo> sometimes the focus is set automcatically to the mouse position if the result list is reloaded
[09:21:26] <_ramo> and sometimes the result list doesn't appear at all
[09:21:41] <_ramo> but i know that we have results therefore
[09:32:17] <_ramo> kborchers: hm, it would be just good to remove the focus when the result list is reloaded
[09:32:37] <_ramo> this is currently not the case... the list updates, and the focus is set again, even if i don't move the mouse
[09:34:29] <kborchers> _ramo: my suggestion at this point, if you don't think that PR is fixing your issue is to find a fix and submit a new PR
[09:35:37] <_ramo> kborchers: i would if i would be a javascript.ninja ;) but i'm not
[10:08:09] <kborchers> i thought that would never end :P
[10:08:54] <scott_gonzalez> Seems a bit ridiculous
[10:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> He clearly doesn't understand what the problem is.
[10:10:01] <kborchers> right
[10:10:21] <kborchers> i tried to help but once it got to the point of "it doesn't work", i checked out
[10:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[10:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> It didn't start off well with not using git and not knowing how to get the source files.
[10:11:32] <scott_gonzalez> Even after I told him to look in the development-bundle directory from the download, he still had trouble :-/
[10:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty excited about the new easing code :-)
[10:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> I changed the elastic and back easings a tiny bit (I think the new versions look better).
[10:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> They're pretty small changes, I doubt you could even really tell.
[10:14:15] <kborchers> yeah, from what you showed the other day, looking good!
[10:14:18] <scott_gonzalez> But looking at the equations plotted on a graph, they look better :-)
[10:22:32] <_ramo> kborchers: the only issue is, when changing one time the mouse coordinated on the resultlist... then on deletion of one or more  charactars refreshes the resultlist, and the focus is set immediately. if navigating with the arrow down button and deleting characters, the focus is always "unset". is it possible to "unset" the focus on refresh of the result list?
[10:35:00] <kborchers> bye bye

[12:15:49] <jq-jenkins> * kris.borchers: Menu: Whitespace
[12:17:09] <kborchers> i don't want to hear it jq-jenkins!
[12:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> It drives me nuts that jq-jenkins doesn't link to the actual test run
[12:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> I just want the link to http://swarm.jquery.org/job/727/
[12:29:49] <kborchers> +1!
[12:30:22] <kborchers> what is up with menu tests? guess i should look at that :/
[12:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> I think you broke stuff.
[12:30:47] <kborchers> i think you're right :P
[12:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> That'll teach you not to yell at jq-jenkins
[12:31:03] <kborchers> lol
[12:31:36] <kborchers> yeah, it's all keyboard nav stuff ... woops
[12:31:50] <kborchers> visually it works though so must just be the way the tests are set up
[12:32:17] <kborchers> i think those need to be rewritten
[12:32:25] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez you know you can get that in the "view console output" inside jenkins job page?
[12:33:27] <kborchers> clarkbox: i did not know that! thanks! ... still wish it was right there on the job page though
[12:33:36] <scott_gonzalez> Can we get it front and center on the Jenkins job page?
[12:33:38] <clarkbox> FYI dont assume browserstack is running things correctly. i have caught false fails by browserstack workers - especially with IE6/7/8
[12:33:45] <scott_gonzalez> Also, can we get jq-jenkins to link to both?
[12:33:47] <clarkbox> i dont know much about jenkins
[12:34:10] <clarkbox> add an issue for it in the infrastructure repo if you like
[12:34:50] <kborchers> nope, just ran those tests myself and still broken
[12:34:55] <kborchers> not browserstack's fault
[12:51:44] <kborchers> #$&(^% IE!!!!!

[13:03:19] <kborchers> any recommendations on eliminating this http://gyazo.com/e05c4ee47ad1dfa53f4227549254cabb in IE would be great. tests all pass in other browsers
