[07:38:25] <arschmitz> gseguin: morning
[07:48:43] <gseguin> arschmitz: did you see my comment here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6814#issuecomment-31102829
[07:55:51] <JamesMGreene> Hey Mobile types: anyway to short circuit a page transition from a listview?
[07:56:23] <JamesMGreene> I really just want to use it as a fancy radio button list to select a single item and then close its dialog to report the selection back to the parent UI control
[07:57:08] <JamesMGreene> Maybe just add a "click" handler for the anchor tag and `return false;`?
[07:57:28] <JamesMGreene> or `e.preventDefault();`, etc.
[08:01:08] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: why don't you use the checkboxradio widget for this?
[08:02:43] <JamesMGreene> uGoMobi: Hey, Jasper!  I also have thumbnails, search filtering, etc. from the ListView
[08:03:04] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: ah ok, gotcha
[08:06:07] <JamesMGreene> uGoMobi: So yeah, anyway to short-circuit the page navigation and just treat it like a click handler?  href="", href="javascript:void(0);", etc.?
[08:11:09] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: not sure if I completely understand what you are trying to do
[08:11:53] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: you can just do add a click handler
[08:12:38] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: I don't see the relationship between the listview and the page transition
[08:21:10] <JamesMGreene> Docs suggest that having the anchor tag will lead to an automatic page transition
[08:22:05] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: if you link to another page
[08:22:57] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: when you say page transition, do you mean closing the dialog and transition back to the previous page?
[08:23:53] <JamesMGreene> [10:22] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: if you link to another page
[08:24:02] <JamesMGreene> ^ I think that probably answers my question
[08:24:19] <JamesMGreene> I haven't tried this yet, was just building out the example
[08:24:32] <JamesMGreene> So yeah, it's probably all good
[08:24:47] <JamesMGreene> So I even need the anchor tag then?  Maybe not
[08:24:51] <JamesMGreene> Do I*
[08:27:18] <JamesMGreene> Looks like the demos use href="#", that should work
[08:27:24] <JamesMGreene> Thanks, Jasper!
[08:27:35] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: yeah that should be fine
[08:27:49] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: np

[09:20:10] <JamesMGreene> uGoMobi et al: is `$(' my mobile widget ').trigger('create');` no longer the correct way to kick-off widgetization?
[09:22:20] <JamesMGreene> Or just like `.listview();`?
[09:24:20] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: yeah .trigger("create") has been deprecated
[09:24:55] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: you can use enhanceWithin() to initialized widgets
[09:25:22] <uGoMobi> or just call the plugin
[09:27:19] <uGoMobi> (assuming you are using 1.4.0)

[10:07:29] <JamesMGreene> uGoMobi: Would a bug for the jQM download builder UI go in the jquerymobile.com repo?
[10:08:06] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: the download builder has its own repo and issue tracker
[10:08:08] <JamesMGreene> (for this page: http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/ )
[10:08:23] <gseguin> uGoMobi: we should close that repo
[10:08:38] <uGoMobi> JamesMGreene: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder/issues?state=open
[10:08:38] <gseguin> since the download builder now belongs to the website
[10:09:32] <uGoMobi> gseguin: good point
[10:09:46] <gseguin> actually it's more complex than that
[10:10:00] <gseguin> the js is in the content repo
[10:10:03] <uGoMobi> gseguin: although I would like to see DB issues separate from other issues with the site
[10:10:08] <gseguin> the html is in the website repo
[10:10:12] <gseguin> true
[10:10:39] <gseguin> but can we find a way to have the html & the js live in the same place?
[10:10:42] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: ^
[10:11:08] <uGoMobi> gseguin: we have to keep in mind that we are planning on switching to UI's download builder
[10:11:19] <gseguin> true
[10:11:45] <uGoMobi> don't like to keep directing people to different issue trackers
[10:11:58] <gseguin> makes sense
[10:13:17] <uGoMobi> let's ask rxaviers and scott_gonzalez what the setup will be when we are using UI's builder
[10:13:54] <uGoMobi> then we can see if we can already move in that direction with current builder
[10:13:57] * rxaviers will read in a sec...
[10:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Yes, look at the UI download builder.
[10:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/blob/master/grunt.js#L42
[10:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's a very simple process.
[10:18:23] <rxaviers> just let me know in any question on regard to that db process
[10:27:55] <JamesMGreene> ...OK, so I still have no idea where to file the bug :)
[10:28:07] <JamesMGreene> So I can just tell you all  :-P
[10:28:30] <arschmitz> JamesMGreene: they should be on jquerymobile.com
[10:28:37] <JamesMGreene> On http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/ the "Dialogs" option shows up twice under the "Widgets" section
[10:28:37] <arschmitz> JamesMGreene: but you can just tell me :)
[10:29:19] <JamesMGreene> Simple enough, I'd hope
[10:29:24] <arschmitz> JamesMGreene: thank you and THAT is actually an issue with the lib it self lol so jquery-mobile is the right repo
[10:29:33] <arschmitz> JamesMGreene: yup know exactly what it is
[10:30:04] <JamesMGreene> lol, oy
[10:30:33] <arschmitz> there is a dialog widget and dialog extension and they both have the same name in the metta comments
[10:30:51] <arschmitz> need to change the name of one of them
[10:31:01] <JamesMGreene> ah, gotcha

[14:46:17] * gseguin is clueless about how wordpress works
[14:46:41] <uGoMobi> gseguin: some MySQL database
[14:47:05] <gseguin> uGoMobi: at wordpress or on a jQuery server?

[14:51:52] <uGoMobi> yeah I remember we were trying to get 1.3.2 on the CDN
[14:51:59] <uGoMobi> Google CDN*
[14:52:20] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I don't know much about our CDN so I can't review
[14:53:01] <gseguin> uGoMobi: the cdn build target was stripping out the version from the filenames 
[14:53:19] <gseguin> I had copy/pasted the googleCDN copy task
[14:53:27] <uGoMobi> ah right, that caused the broken links
[14:53:40] <gseguin> I made it a regular copy instead
