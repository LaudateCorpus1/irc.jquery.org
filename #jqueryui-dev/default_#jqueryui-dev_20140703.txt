[08:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: WHERE ARE YOU?!?!?!?!
[08:12:57] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll and I just spent two and a half hours rebasing datepicker...
[08:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui/compare/datepicker-rebase-cleanup
[08:16:13] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: hey
[08:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> yay, you're here!
[08:16:34] <jzaefferer> rebasing the whole branch? That's quite a feat
[08:16:40] <jzaefferer> this doesn't yet include the calendar split?
[08:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't include the split. This is just a rebase of what's on origin datepicker.
[08:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> If you're good with what we've come up with, I can force push that to the datepicker branch, then start on rebasing the PR.
[08:18:24] <scott_gonzalez> I use the term rebasing loosely here, as I think I'll actually need to cherry-pick each commit individually and address conflicts as I go.
[08:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> We can go over it on a call if you want.
[08:22:37] <jzaefferer> Can't really do a detailed review of this rebase
[08:22:42] <jzaefferer> At a glance it looks alright
[08:22:54] <jzaefferer> Cherry-picking the calendar split sounds fine, too
[08:24:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I'll go ahead with this.
[09:58:50] <jonasee> Hi i was told that jquery mobile 1.4.3 would be released by begin june, its now begin july.. any updates??
[10:15:22] <jasperdegroot> jonasee: it has been released
[10:15:45] <jasperdegroot> jonasee: http://jquerymobile.com/download/
[10:16:41] <jonasee> oh great! :D wasn't aware of it.. thank you :)
[10:19:08] <jonasee> btw any schedule for 1.5 ^^ it looks promising :D
[10:23:11] <jasperdegroot> jonasee: no, no ETA yet for 1.5
[10:23:34] <jonasee> alright no problem keep it up! :)
[10:24:02] <jasperdegroot> thanks
[11:01:18] <gseguin> jasperdegroot: meeting?
[11:01:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ^
[11:01:55] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: yeah, will open the room
[11:02:08] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: arschmitz is on vacation
[11:02:12] <jasperdegroot> but we can have a short meeting
[11:02:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, right ... now I remember.
[11:39:16] <tj_vantoll> fyi here's my first stab at the progressbar widget as a web component: https://github.com/tjvantoll/ui-web-components
[11:39:16] <tj_vantoll> Canary only because HTML imports aren't in stable yet. The widget doesn't use shadow DOM or the template element (yet), but I'm going to experiment with those next.
[11:45:35] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: I was just thinking that there's no better way to shake down the demos than people casually browsing them. It's a different mindset than when they're looking for a specifc solution to a specific problem.
[11:46:24] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Maybe in the browsing-the-demos-linked-from-the-blogpost mindset they're more likely to spot things like "that's weird - shouldn't that close?"
[11:46:33] <jasperdegroot> I think that already happens, although I don't have analytics
[11:46:54] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, great! If we're already getting that, all the better!

[14:33:46] <jonasdb> hello can somebody help me?
[14:37:29] <jonasdb> i'm having troubles with the slider.. http://jsbin.com/hiwolepe/1/edit for some reason if it is autoinitiiazed it works fine.. but if i call on input type range .slider() method i get another html output.. (input type number when autoinitialized, otherwise else its type range)
[14:50:40] <gabriel_schulhof> jonasdb: That's because the autoinitialized slider undergoes two initialization steps. First, the range input is removed from the DOM and replaced by a number input, and then the slider widget is created.
[14:53:26] <gabriel_schulhof> jonasdb: You should instantiate the slider widget on a number input, not a range input.
[14:56:12] <jonasdb> ok let me try that, thanks :)
[14:58:53] <jonasdb> yes it seems to work, although the box with the number in it doesnt get styled (shadow and round corners)
[15:00:42] <jonasdb> btw maybe you already know but.. the api.jquerymobile site still uses 1.4.2, and http://api.jquerymobile.com/slider/ says that you need to call slider() on an input with type range, so maybe that needs an update :)
