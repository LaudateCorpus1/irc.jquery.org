[05:42:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:43:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: rawgithub.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile-event-debugger/v0.0.4/jquery.mobile.event.debugger.js currently is not reachable for some reason, causing casper to fail miserably.
[05:44:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i cant load anything off rawgithub right now
[05:45:06] <arschmitz> seems like they are having issues nothing we can do
[05:45:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Nope ... :/
[05:46:01] <arschmitz> odd maybe they switched back to rawgit.com thats working
[05:46:15] <arschmitz> but they had said not to use that anymore and it had been redirecting to rawgithub
[05:47:08] <gabriel_schulhof> *shrug* ...
[05:47:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, at any rate, I'll re-start the travis job for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7761 when rawgithub regains consciousness.
[05:47:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hmm check this out though https://rawgit.com/
[05:48:06] <arschmitz> there is a cdn option
[05:48:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Looking at that. Yeah.
[05:48:23] <gabriel_schulhof> ... though no uptime guarantee.
[05:48:30] <arschmitz> we need to switch to that 
[05:48:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, look ... MaxCDN ...
[05:48:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well anything we link to for stuff like this will not really have any gurantee
[05:49:19] <arschmitz> but its demos its not like going to break the entire site or anything just an individual demo or two might flake out
[05:49:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but it plays havoc with travis.
[05:49:30] <gabriel_schulhof> We need to work around that.
[05:49:39] <ldeluca_> gabriel_schulhof: thanks for looking at my pull request.  I'll make the changes you suggested this  morning
[05:49:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i dont think its a problem
[05:49:47] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca_: OK.
[05:50:01] <arschmitz> its not the end of the world if travis fails for an hour
[05:50:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: No, I guess we don't get, like, 3 PRs per minute or anything :)
[05:50:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: github goes down it self sometimes
[05:51:11] <arschmitz> so can travis or our servers or any number of external things we cant really control
[05:51:21] <gabriel_schulhof> The Web is a wacky and wonderful place :)
[05:51:36] <gabriel_schulhof> No, make that a wacky and wonderful world.
[05:53:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Is rawgithub and/or rawgit in any way affiliated with github? It doesn't look like it, because status.github.com mentions nothing of this.
[05:53:44] <arschmitz> i think rawgithub is but im not sure i dont think rawgit is
[05:54:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ... weird, then ...
[05:54:09] <arschmitz> it was raw.github at one point too
[05:54:24] <arschmitz> then thre is raw.githubusercontent lol
[05:57:58] <gabriel_schulhof> *sigh* ...

[06:27:38] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, just had my first moment when I wanted to not support IE8...
[06:27:50] <arschmitz> lol
[06:28:06] <arschmitz> and what prompted it?
[06:30:00] <scott_gonzalez> Lack of window.getSelection()
[06:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> Working on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10639
[06:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> The workaround actually isn't that bad.
[06:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/xeleguzidufu/2/edit
[06:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna try implementing that in selectmenu.
[06:30:53] <arschmitz> ahh 
[06:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> It's been years since I had to work with text selection.
[06:31:08] <arschmitz> yeah thats annoying but at least not too complicated
[06:31:11] <scott_gonzalez> So glad to not be working on WYSIWYG editors any more.
[06:31:24] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: right i never use that any more nothing we do generally requires it lol
[06:31:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah those are ... fun
[06:31:57] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i worked on one before too 
[06:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> We built ours around CKEditor. So much nicer to work with than TinyMCE.
[06:32:23] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: the one you made was pretty cool from what you have told me though
[06:32:36] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah i found the same
[06:32:42] <scott_gonzalez> Too bad their dev team was completely unresponsive.
[06:32:51] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: when i used TinyMCE i felt like i was always fighting it 
[06:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> I tried really hard to get involved.
[06:33:15] <scott_gonzalez> They basically just ignored every email, bug report, and patch I sent.
[06:33:25] <arschmitz> yeah i tried to get them to fix their docs with no luck
[06:33:30] <scott_gonzalez> They clearly weren't interseted in community involvement.
[06:33:45] <arschmitz> they were completely broken and tons of sections just didnt exist
[06:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> We even rewrote some of their plugins for the FCK -> CK API changes.
[06:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> They just ignored them for years.
[06:34:24] <scott_gonzalez> Such a terrible OSS experience.
[06:34:37] <arschmitz> i would find my self looking at old docs versions then trying to find the similar looking code in new version to see if things were still there or how they had changed
[06:35:02] <arschmitz> because the docs sections would just be missing in new version with no explination
[06:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, that bin fails in IE7, but I'm not sure if it's the code or jsbin itself.
[06:36:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just implement it and see what happens.
[06:36:26] <arschmitz> jsbin does not work in ie7 if i recall
[06:36:42] <arschmitz> not the edit view anyway
[06:36:51] <arschmitz> the full screen view should be fine
[06:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> It's funny that I often forget about Safari.
[06:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> Meanwhile it's the dominant mobile browser.
[06:42:34] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: related to Safari forgetting that the rest of the world exists in their development?
[06:42:35] <kborchers> ;)
[06:42:41] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's mutual ignorance.
[06:43:08] <kborchers> :)
[06:44:06] <scott_gonzalez> So, IE is the only browser that loses text selection when you click on a menu item in the selectmenu.
[06:44:15] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for requiring EVEN MORE CODE.
[06:45:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: the thing is though i think i agree with IE's interaction there
[06:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> Text selection is whacky.
[06:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> It's sort of based on focus, but not always.
[06:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> And native selects never kill text selection.
[06:45:50] <kborchers> right
[06:45:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure why that's the case.
[06:46:03] <kborchers> hmm, interesting
[06:46:17] <scott_gonzalez> That's the root of this whole problem. The weird native behavior.
[06:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to reimplement that isn't fun.
[06:47:12] <kborchers> yeah that sounds horrible ... i blame extra markup in the menu ;P
[06:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> hahaha
[06:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> Can't blame it since it doesn't exist in master :-P
[06:47:39] <kborchers> damn
[06:49:17] <scott_gonzalez> I think the only "less typing" feature I want in JS is the ability to have `{ foo() { ... } }` instead of `{ foo: function() { ... } }`
[06:49:38] <scott_gonzalez> I accidentally type that all the time.
[06:52:05] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...does IE really prevent focus from moving to the native select on click?
[06:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> s/native/custom/
[06:53:19] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I wonder if setting the text selection is killing the focus.
[06:53:23] <scott_gonzalez> Well that sucks.
[06:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> Interestingly, programmatically setting focus to the button after setting selection doens't kill the selection.
[07:12:25] <ldeluca_> kborchers: setting to ssl and 6697 works
[07:12:49] <ldeluca_> Should I update the site to mention that? seems important :)
[07:14:00] <kborchers> ldeluca_: i just tested again without SSL and it worked fine
[07:14:21] <ldeluca_> kborchers: you must have the magic touch.  let me try again
[07:14:36] <krisborchers> ldeluca2: this is me from that other server not over SSL
[07:20:13] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca_: _safelyBlur() is not supposed to check for parentage/descendency. That test cannot be centralized into _safelyBlur(). Only the testing of the element to be blurred can be centralized.
[07:20:42] <ldeluca_> gabriel_schulhof: okay, i'll pull that test out and try again
[07:20:48] <ldeluca_> gabriel_schulhof: makes more sense that way
[07:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> ldeluca_ kborchers: It's probably the client being smart/dumb.
[07:23:39] <kborchers> yeah
[07:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Are you manually setting the port based on SSL or is it doing it for you?
[07:23:54] <kborchers> manually
[07:24:26] <kborchers> actually, it changes it for me but i see it change in the field so i know it's right and could change easily if i want
[07:24:30] <scott_gonzalez> ldeluca_: Which port did you try when you didn't use SSL?
[07:24:57] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca_: You need to modify the function _safelyBlur() itself, and the two calls. You need not pass in a container - only the element that may or may not get blurred.
[07:25:30] <ldeluca_> gabriel_schulhof: just pushed an update
[07:26:16] <ldeluca_> scott_gonzalez: default for limechat which is 6667
[07:28:34] <ldeluca_> gabriel_schulhof: eek, ignore, had some white space errors when running the test
[07:28:35] <ldeluca_> one sec
[07:30:26] <ldeluca_> gabriel_schulhof: okay, tests pass now
[07:30:37] <ldeluca_> safelyBlur is only taking in the target element

[08:18:14] <hlvwrk> question. I'm trying to load a custom jquerymobile build, and create a flip toggle switch on a form... it isn't working. Is there anything I need to do outside of loading jQuery, jQuery.Mobile.custom.js, the two stylesheets, and creating the form element (<input data-role="flipswitch" name="flip-checkbox-1" id="flip-checkbox-1" type="checkbox">)? 
[08:18:54] <hlvwrk> It doesn't seem to do anything to the checkbox. remains default styling
[08:19:02] <hlvwrk> No errors, nothing.

[08:39:13] <kborchers> hlvwrk: this channel is for development of the UI and Mobile libraries. you want #jquery for support as it says in the topic
[08:40:04] <hlvwrk> Thanks. I'll try there
[08:44:34] <hlvwrk> Can I ask a question about the custom package download here?
[08:44:38] <hlvwrk> Or there for that as well
[09:04:16] <ldeluca2> kborchers: arschmitz: question, So i was able to reproduce this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7571
[09:04:24] <ldeluca2> but i noticed that it doesn't have anything to do with jquery mobile
[09:04:36] <ldeluca2> so i suggested that the issue be closed and that the submitter open an issue for apache cordova
[09:05:04] <ldeluca2> is this typically how you handle this type of cordova issue that doesn't appear to be related to jquery?
[09:08:17] <hlvwrk> Is the custom package build broke? Or am I missing something entirely?
[09:26:41] <ldeluca2> Anyone have a link to the suggestions for new users who are opening issues?  I don't see a link off of the main markdown file for jquery-mobile https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile

[09:51:55] <arschmitz> because of our multi line rules
[09:52:34] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: you will have to actually do it in an editor i think
[09:53:20] <ldeluca2> okay, let me try that for my next commit.  Learning... :)
[09:53:49] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: no problem 
[09:54:15] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: we have a script to generate change logs and it depends on the commit message format 
[09:55:48] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: that said we will have to rebase anything that lands anyway so dont worry about fixing ones you already did
[09:56:18] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: okay, thanks
[10:25:30] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: can you give me an example of how you do the git commit?  are you using a mac?
[10:25:41] <arschmitz> yes im on a mac
[10:25:46] <ldeluca2> having trouble with git commit --file=/path/to/sometext.txt file
[10:25:58] <arschmitz> whats your default text editor in the console?
[10:26:10] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: just do git commit
[10:26:29] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: i think its vim by default
[10:27:01] <arschmitz> it will create a temp file for the commit 
[10:27:08] <arschmitz> add your message and save it
[10:28:20] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: so for me i do git commit and that opens up sublime text 2 with a file that looks like https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/35d74a0d5c837519ea17
[10:28:32] <ldeluca2> Lisas-MacBook-Pro:jquery-mobile ldeluca$ git commit
[10:28:32] <ldeluca2> error: There was a problem with the editor 'vi'.
[10:28:32] <ldeluca2> Please supply the message using either -m or -F option.
[10:29:05] <arschmitz> hmm iv had that problem randomly until i switched to sublime
[10:29:15] <arschmitz> but no idea i normally just tried again and it worked
[10:29:23] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: trying again...
[10:29:54] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: you use brackets right? do you have your default editor set to vi intentionally?
[10:30:21] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: i do use brackets.  no, i'm new to using a mac.  so vi must be the default
[10:30:44] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: yes vi is the default but you can change it to brackets im pretty sure
[10:31:44] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: you can change it in your .bash_profile

[10:31:51] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: second time seemed to work like you suggested
[10:32:05] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: let me try to change to brackets
[10:32:13] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: ok yeah it was pretty rare and pretty random for me that error
[10:32:27] <arschmitz> but it did happen sometimes for sure when i used vi
[10:32:38] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: btw, i closed my other pull request and did a new one for the phonegap issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7766
[10:32:52] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: ok thanks
[10:33:15] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: it'd be nice to change the name of the label within github too... but i think an admin user would have to do that update
[10:33:28] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: ill do it right now
[10:34:21] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: fixed
[10:34:31] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: you are FAST!
[10:34:55] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: we try
[10:35:14] <ldeluca2> <---- impressed
[10:35:19] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: thanks for all your work lately its a huge help
[10:35:46] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: no problem, this is fun.  Trying to start with the little things and learn the ropes
[10:36:01] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: as you may have noticed the mobile team is really small so anything is a huge help
[10:36:22] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: yeah that popup issue is actually a pretty complicated one 
[10:36:39] <arschmitz> anything with the popup widget is pretty complicated
[10:36:55] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: yea, gabriel_schulhof has been a huge help... walking me through that one.  He is very patient :)
[10:37:16] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: he originally wrote popup so its kind of his baby it was how he got involved in the first place
[10:57:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Dang! rawgithub is still on the fritz ...
[10:57:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we should switch to the cdn one
[10:58:03] <arschmitz> i think that will be much more reliable
[10:58:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah ... I'll do a quick issue/PR
[10:59:57] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #7767: Page events: Move external reference to rawgit CDN 02http://git.io/80O8QA
[11:00:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we refrence rawgit in several places
[11:00:16] <arschmitz> we need to update them all
[11:00:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll find -type f | xargs grep -niH rawgit
[11:00:41] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: I edited the .bash_profile on my mac to update the EDITOR value to be /Applicatons/Brackets and it doesn't like that when i do git commit.  SAys "No such file or directory"
[11:01:01] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: is the path wrong for accessing something in the Applications directory?
[11:01:04] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca2: IIRC on OSX it's always Something.app
[11:01:22] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca2: That is, the executable for launching an application.
[11:02:02] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: ill check what mine is in a second
[11:02:13] <ldeluca2> gabriel_schulhof: so Brackets.app?
[11:02:19] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: we are starting our weekly meeting if you want to join us in #jquery-meeting
[11:02:38] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca2: Well, if you list the files under /Applcations/Brackets, there should be a Brackets.app
[11:03:01] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: trying to join
[11:03:35] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca2: Every IRC client should understand the command /join #jquery-meeting
[11:03:45] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca2: ... if the pointing-and-clicking method should fail.

[12:04:47] <ldeluca2> congrats cgack!  Do you all have a list of committers somewhere?  I'd be curious to see who is involved
[12:05:00] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: yes just a sec
[12:05:26] <gabriel_schulhof> https://jquery.org/team/ maybe?
[12:05:49] <cgack> ldeluca2: thanks!
[12:05:51] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats everyone in the foundation most of those people do not have commit access to movile
[12:06:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, just mobile. True.
[12:07:04] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: im not sure if this page is public but you can try it https://github.com/orgs/jquery/teams/mobile
[12:07:26] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: 404
[12:07:51] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: if not its just gabriel_schulhof, gseguin|away|awa, cgack, jasperdegroot, agcolom and myself
[12:08:09] <ldeluca2> arschmitz: nice, small group!
[12:08:50] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: yeah gseguin|away|awa handles most of our infrastructure and build stuff and agcolom does most of the docs stuff
[12:09:04] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: she did the original api docs all by herself :)
[12:09:52] <ldeluca2> impressive
[12:11:16] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: yup
[12:11:39] <arschmitz> ldeluca2: and jasperdegroot is kinda our css expert
[12:16:14] <ldeluca2> gabriel_schulhof: fyi, i made your suggested change for my pull request.  let me know if anything else needs to be updated
[12:43:14] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: anchors with data-role="button" will be enhanced by the new button widget, right?
[12:43:28] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yes
[12:43:39] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: but this doesn't work yet?
[12:43:57] <arschmitz> um not sure need to look i think it does though
[12:44:58] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: oh no i guess its missing from the init selector opps
[12:45:00] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: was working on merging button and button-markup demo pages and <a href="#" data-role="button">Anchor</a> gets styled as ui-link 
[12:45:19] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/ui-1-12/js/widgets/forms/button.js#L14 needs to be fixed
[12:45:23] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ah ok
[12:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> This isn't quite correct, but close if you ever want to check other repos:
[12:46:08] <scott_gonzalez> git log --pretty="%cN" --after="1 year ago" | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | head
[12:46:37] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok?
[12:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to see committers in a repo that you don't have access to.
[12:47:00] <arschmitz> ohhh 
[12:47:02] <arschmitz> lol
[12:47:15] <arschmitz> way out of context and late there lol
[12:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I just saw the message :-P
[12:47:45] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: she was asking who had commit access though i think
[12:47:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's a close to correct list.
[12:48:01] <arschmitz> because we had just welcomed cgack
[12:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's everyone who has committed (not authored) in the past year, ordered by number of commits.
[12:48:29] <scott_gonzalez> So it's close to being right :-P
[12:48:42] <arschmitz> oh right i forget about commited vs authored
[12:49:20] <arschmitz> so that includes the board members that have commited thats all
[12:50:39] <arschmitz> execpt Cristi Citea??
[12:50:48] <arschmitz> who is that?
[12:51:15] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[12:51:17] <jasperdegroot> I was just looking that name up on Google :D
[12:51:21] <hlvwrk> lol
[12:51:26] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thats what i just did too
[12:51:45] <arschmitz> how did they commit though is my question?
[12:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> Weird thing is `git log --author="Cristi Citea"` has no result.
[12:52:30] <arschmitz> ok thats really weird
[12:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> Same for --committer
[12:53:09] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't show up in `git shortlog -sne` either.
[12:53:12] <scott_gonzalez> Very odd.
[12:53:19] <jquicommit> [13globalize] 15rxaviers opened issue #338: Docs: List date patterns 02http://git.io/irXv-A
[12:53:31] <arschmitz> so how on earth is it showing up
[12:53:45] <arschmitz> like other people saw this too right?
[12:53:48] <arschmitz> not just me
[12:54:15] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I can confirm
[12:55:01] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: they are in our mailmap
[12:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/5de78be3065316259a33eb813036cc5e8f2a7432
[12:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> The mailmap is why the log didn't work.
[12:56:02] <scott_gonzalez> Kinda annoying that --committer/author doesn't respect the mailmap.
[12:56:30] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I bet this was merged.
[12:56:33] <scott_gonzalez> Like for real merged.
[12:56:44] <arschmitz> oh yeah this is before i changed that
[12:56:47] <arschmitz> its last november
[12:56:52] <arschmitz> it changed in december
[12:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> Which would mean that looking at committers won't tell you anything for other projects.
[12:57:21] <arschmitz> yup any project that does merges 
[12:57:29] <arschmitz> vs rebases 
[12:57:57] <arschmitz> if you changed it to 2 years on mobile it would blow up
