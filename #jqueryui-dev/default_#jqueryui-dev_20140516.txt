[01:43:49] <yossi_> hi, first time here so new to the rools (if any)
[01:44:53] <yossi_> i'm trying to setup some ajax tabs, and it seems that a "feature" (the title changes to loading..) is not working
[01:45:33] <yossi_> the thing is: i can't find ANY documentation for ajaSetting
[01:46:20] <yossi_> in the api documentation. can you please redirect me to that information?
[01:46:23] <yossi_> thanks
[04:21:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[04:32:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: pong!
[04:33:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just realized one thing: In our work with download builder we're essentially writing a static linker.
[04:33:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and in cases where you use requirejs directly in a Web page, you're using a dynamic linker.
[04:33:44] <_|Nix|_> It's too bad we have to re-invent this particular wheel.
[04:34:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we are switching to new download builder soon anyway
[04:34:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You mean different from gseguin's node-amd-builder?
[04:34:52] <arschmitz> yes
[04:35:25] <arschmitz> we have always been planning on switching to ui download builder
[04:35:34] <_|Nix|_> Well, then, who knows, maybe I should hold off on testing with download builder until we've established the download builder.
[04:35:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no because for now this is our builder
[04:36:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, but by the time 1.5.0 rolls around, it may no longer be.
[04:36:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe but thats not an excuse to not test something
[04:36:53] <arschmitz> because it MIGHT not be the case anymore at an undetermined point in the future?
[04:37:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and the new one still uses part of node-amd-builder to parse the css comments
[04:37:27] <arschmitz> at least for now
[04:38:03] <_|Nix|_> At any rate, I'm writing individual module tests to make sure the table works on its own.
[04:38:21] <_|Nix|_> If those pass, there's no reason the download builder version shouldn't pass.
[04:38:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: do you individual modules test css comments?
[04:38:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, but you can't really test CSS anyway. That pretty much has to be done manually.
[04:39:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats why you need to test with download builder
[04:39:17] <_|Nix|_> I mean, I can try to look into ... I dunno ... widths? heights? rgb values?
[04:39:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we have repeatedly had issues with things not working correctly with download builder
[04:39:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: as a result we need to tests
[04:39:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I have, like, two PRs that introduce tests/css which test exactly widths/heights/rgb values.
[04:40:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats still not checking the css comments?
[04:40:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm beginning to think that maybe I should write a stylsheet injector akin to $.testHelper.asyncLoad()
[04:41:02] <arschmitz> just checking that css is there which of course it is we load the whole css bundle
[04:41:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think you should just test it with the download builder
[04:41:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The problem with that is it can't be done automatically.
[04:41:35] <arschmitz> so?
[04:41:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, it's tedious, and cannot be continuously integrated.
[04:42:00] <arschmitz> this isnt something your going to do everyday its only for widgets that are new or re-written
[04:42:15] <arschmitz> this is a step before a new or re-written widget can be merged
[04:42:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I get that, and of course I'm on board for doing things this way for a review/rewrite/new widget. I'm just thinking about doing real CSS testing.
[04:43:00] <_|Nix|_> s/for doing/with doing/
[04:44:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The common thread for all download builder/automated test JS handling is requirejs. We've unified the way we load JS modules whether via $.testHelper.asyncLoad() or via download builder or via requirejs directly. We need to do the same with CSS.
[04:47:24] <_|Nix|_> On that cheery note, I can report that I'm stuck when it comes to deploying gseguin's builder locally. It keeps giving me 404 for any and all URLs. And, as far as I can debug, it doesn't even call the hooks that are supposed to handle the various URLs you request of it.
[04:47:38] <_|Nix|_> I even ran it with strace, and it never actually looks for files in staging and/or repos.
[04:47:47] <_|Nix|_> So, I /must/ be doing something wrong.
[04:48:27] <_|Nix|_> I'll return to trying to make it work after I've finished the individual-modules tests.
[04:49:02] <arschmitz> it took me a while but it was just getting the directory structure right
[04:49:08] <arschmitz> as its weird and misleading in the readme
[04:50:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you create a gist of the output of find . running from the root of the working node-amd-builder and tell me the command line you used to start it?
[04:52:01] <arschmitz> sure

[04:54:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it overflows my terminal buffer lol
[04:55:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Try | grep -v node_modules
[04:55:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The contents of node_modules shouldn't really matter, although I suspect it does.
[04:56:01] <arschmitz> but basicly inside staging is staging/jquery/master/jquery-mobile/ everything in repo
[04:56:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, and I've tried to add staging/jquery/7360-table-review/jquery-mobile/ everything in repo, and zilch.
[04:56:46] <arschmitz> inside repos  jquery/jquery-mobile.git and thats a bare clone
[04:56:52] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[04:57:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm telling you, I ran it with node --debug --debug-brk, and it's not even calling the handlers that gseguin creates for handling the various requests. I don't get it.

[04:58:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I traced into express() and it seems it cannot find the handlers. Or the patterns given in the handlers fail to match the URL.
[04:58:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Truly weird, because the URL obviously fits the pattern.
[04:58:38] <_|Nix|_> So, I'm suspecting a problem with the pattern matching algorithm.
[04:58:47] <_|Nix|_> ... but that's waaay too deep into the stack.
[04:59:16] <_|Nix|_> ... meaning that it may have gotten broken by some new version of some package in node_modules

[05:15:24] <arschmitz> and it works fine again
[05:16:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:  so new versions should not be an issue 
[05:16:30] <_|Nix|_> Dang nab it.
[05:16:38] <_|Nix|_> Then I have no clue what's the problem.
[05:34:02] <_|Nix|_> OK. There's a discrepancy between what builder.js requests and what node-amd-builder expects.
[05:35:12] <_|Nix|_> OK. The host cannot be specified with a trailing /.
[05:35:32] <_|Nix|_> For example, http://localhost:3000/ causes it to request //v1/dependency/...
[05:35:55] <_|Nix|_> You need to specify the amd builder host without a trailing /, i.e., http://localhost:3000
[05:37:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Boom!
[05:38:03] <_|Nix|_> Workses!
[05:44:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh were you using builder this whole time i set it up doing requests via curl and got it working before messing with builder
[05:45:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I was getting 500s for my curl requests, and the ultimate goal is to get the builder working, and it's easy enough to get the builder to make a request.
[05:45:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I got it working.
[05:46:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also took a while to get used to working with bare repos.
[05:46:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok well at least its working now
[05:47:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: need to make an install script :) and i need to finish my pr for the read me too
[05:47:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sadly my todo only grows longer these days :(
[05:48:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I know the feeling. I can't see the end either.
[05:49:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We need to put the entire Universe next to an even bigger black hole and then just take our time.
[05:49:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or at least the planet.
[05:50:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well there is a massive one right in the center of our galaxy 
[05:50:29] <arschmitz> only problem is that whole constantly expanding universe things
[05:50:37] <arschmitz> we are getting further away not closer
[06:00:05] <_|Nix|_> :)
[06:00:20] <_|Nix|_> Dang nab it. Now we really have no way of coping!
[06:00:45] <_|Nix|_> They don't make black holes like they used to ... *sigh*
[06:04:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Since table has two extensions, is it sufficient to test a custom build with the base and the two extensions checked off?
[06:04:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alternatively, I could make three builds: One with only the base, one with only reflow, and one with only columntoggle.
[06:08:17] <_|Nix|_> Well, now that I have it up and running and I'm fairly confident it'll work with DB, I'll make all remaining changes I'm gonna make, and then test with DB. After all, I don't wanna have to re-test, because I've made changes to the branch.

[09:37:53] <rxaviers> Should we keep CDN as they were, or should we make it consistent with the new download package?
[09:38:09] <scott_gonzalez> I think it needs to stay how it is.
[09:38:54] <scott_gonzalez> We might be able to simplify it a bit, but I don't think we can get anywhere close to what we did with the download package.
[09:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> Even Google wants to be able to pull individual files from the CDN.
[09:39:38] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: That's still true, right? ^

[13:11:53] <tj_vantoll> I'm looking for opinions if anyone is around.
[13:11:53] <tj_vantoll> I'm about to land this: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/419/commits. Is it worth trying to leave this as a few commits, or should I just squash the whole thing into one?
[13:12:50] <tj_vantoll> There are several changes in there, so it'd be nice to use a few commits, but it's also tricky to break up because of the ordering. It's certainly easier to use only one commit so I'm leaning towards that.
[13:36:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: We need to think about what kinds of extension points we want to make available for table.
[13:36:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats what the issue is for
[13:36:43] <arschmitz> add a section for it with your suggestions
[13:37:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: For example, I was about to remove _addLabels() but then I realized we might want to keep it around in case people want to add labels differently.
[13:37:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I'll document _addLabels() as an extension point.
[13:39:10] <_|Nix|_> I'll be maximalist. I'll suggest many extension points, and we can eliminate some as useless.
