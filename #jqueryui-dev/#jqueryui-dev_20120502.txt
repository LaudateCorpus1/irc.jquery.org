[09:19:06] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: That ticket is going to close on its own unless he provides a test case.

[13:31:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so whats happening in that fiddle?
[13:32:03] <gnarf> ui#8288
[13:34:12] <gnarf> is is because its a file input that has focus?
[13:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Checking it out right now.
[13:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> But I think that's the problem.
[13:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> I *just* got it down to the bare minimum.
[13:47:59] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/2efq2/6/
[13:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> If you put a break point where the error occurs, you'll see that the input element is no longer in the document.
[13:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> Which doesn't make sense.
[13:50:23] <gnarf> um
[13:50:26] <gnarf> yeah
[13:50:55] <gnarf> hrm
[13:53:25] <gnarf> what version of FF are you reproing this with?
[13:53:29] <gnarf> I can't repro with FF10
[13:53:57] <gnarf> oh wait
[13:53:59] <gnarf> just got it
[13:54:01] <gnarf> check this out
[13:54:11] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/2efq2/7/
[13:54:32] <gnarf> just adding the second <input> makes it not reproducable
[13:55:25] <gnarf> sigh
[13:55:29] <rworth> could that be related to single input submits on enter?
[13:55:31] <gnarf> this is ultra wacky
[13:55:52] <gnarf> its happening now, but when i first tried that /7/ it wasn't reproducable
[13:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> You have to click in the text field, not the button.
[13:56:23] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise it's not reproducible.
[13:56:26] <gnarf> ahhh
[13:56:43] <scott_gonzalez> Took me a while to figure that out.
[13:58:34] <gnarf> so, it seems that FF makes an actual <input type="text">
[13:58:39] <gnarf> that is document.activeElement
[14:00:37] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/3E1W1F2w1d2h1z1p3p3q -> console -> http://cl.ly/0U2e3r2C0L0u0l0v3F29 <-- click on the input --> http://cl.ly/1z2T1C1M2R2d2I3R2M0d
[14:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> Is it exposing the shadow DOM?
[14:02:35] <gnarf> yup
[14:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> That's fucked up.
[14:02:46] <gnarf> i'm inclined to say vendor bug?
[14:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> Absolutely.
[14:03:19] <gnarf> Let me see if I can reduce this to plain JS
[14:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I was just about to do :-)
[14:03:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: well, i'll let you do it if you want - I have work work i could be doin
[14:04:03] <gnarf> what should we do about it in effects core?
[14:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it looks like we have to use a try/catch
[14:04:36] * gnarf shudders
[14:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> Because even trying to check active.parentNode throws an error
[14:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to figure out if there's anything else we can do.
[14:08:04] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/wfkxu/
[14:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/2efq2/9/
[14:09:16] <scott_gonzalez> pretty similar
[14:11:28] <gnarf> that assertion fails in chrome too
[14:11:51] <gnarf> but active is body in chrome
[14:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'll file a bug with Mozilla.
[14:16:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://jsfiddle.net/wfkxu/2/
[14:17:09] <gnarf> chrome never gives you focus events
[14:17:16] <gnarf> it also never sets the input as focused
[14:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[14:18:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thats about as close to the ACTUAL use case we are using as I can get it without going beyond "minimal reproduction" :)
[14:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> dinner time
[14:30:07] <gnarf> btw scott_gonzalez - started reviewing / working with this guy on https://github.com/SineSwiper/jquery-ui/commit/238e01f9e68c6baea606c2cd09eac785c5c257e8
[14:30:08] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by SineSwiper (4w, 34m ago): Slide function now works without DIV wrapping, utilizing clip Split out clip step routines to use cssHook, including TBLR "virtual" CSS properties Add CSS3 units to cssUnitConvert function Add directionNormalize function to help out with direction naming Fixed 404s for tests/index.html
[14:32:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: also - out of curiosity - do you think there is any merit in thinking about some effects like the page transitions in mobile - if your browser can't support the stuff for it, fall down to "fade" ?
[15:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> You mean like flip and turn?
[16:17:22] <gnarf> kinda
[16:17:32] <gnarf> i was just thinking about browser clip support
[16:48:13] <scott_gonzalez> Don't all browsers support clip?
