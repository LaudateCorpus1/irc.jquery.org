[07:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Any idea why this fiddle isn't creating tabs? http://jsfiddle.net/Fx8aG/6/
[07:52:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: :/ nope
[07:52:35] <kborchers> i usually use the add resources section though instead of the html
[07:52:40] <kborchers> but shouldn't make a difference
[07:52:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i tested that with git and it failed too, fyi
[07:53:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's using 2 deprecated APIs :-P
[07:55:44] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: really? what is being removed?
[07:55:56] <scott_gonzalez> The add and select methods.
[07:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> Use refresh instead of add and set the active option instead of calling the select method.
[07:57:12] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, it actually uses three deprecated APIs.
[07:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's calling the length method too.
[07:57:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: is this all documented somewhere yet?
[07:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#tabs
[07:58:27] <kborchers> ah, ok
[08:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: This is broken at least as far back as 1.8.0.
[08:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm inclined to close as patcheswelcome.
[08:02:25] <kborchers> go for it … i was helping a guy in #jquery and saw this and told him to watch the bug and also told him he could submit a fix :)
[08:02:34] <kborchers> and gave him that workaround so ...

[12:10:37] <nacin> scott_gonzalez or gnarf: how do you handle cross-references for duplicate tickets on Trac?
[12:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> We close as duplicate and it automatically adds the cross-references in both tickets.
[12:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> I assume it's a plugin.
[12:11:36] <nacin> so it's specifically part of the "Action"
[12:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1y3i1D2N2q1R
[12:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:12:45] <nacin> nice, thanks. looking at what appears to be the same plugin then.
[12:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's much nicer than when we used to do it manually.
[12:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> Since we only got the link in one direction.
[12:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> Nobody would take the time to update the ticket that was still open.
[12:16:29] <nacin> We do, but it's admittedly annoying.
[12:16:47] <nacin> Every few months or so I go through and add a few pieces of functionality to our Trac, so I'm looking around.
[12:17:28] <nacin> It'd be cool for it to just parse the ticket body and handle references, too. "#123 was referenced for the first time from #1234."
[12:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that'd be nice. I think FogBugz does that.
[13:19:17] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I just pushed a tag here: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/tags - that should trigger something, right? is that available somewhere to test?
[13:19:36] <gnarf> jzaefferer: that should update the live server version
[13:19:50] <gnarf> jq02.jquery.com
[13:20:05] <jzaefferer> so http://jq02.jquery.com:3000/ should do something?
[13:21:10] <gnarf> except it didn't
[13:21:21] <gnarf> because the repo didn't have that post-receive setup
[13:21:35] <gnarf> try again :)
[13:21:48] <jzaefferer> syslog is full of jQuery Mobile download builder...
[13:22:10] <jzaefferer> pushed 1.0.0pre2
[13:22:57] <jzaefferer> aha, now syslog is showing something
[13:23:39] <jzaefferer> I guess the server fails to start as `grunt prepare` needs to run...
[13:23:44] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/404461899c6b356d702b
[13:23:46] <jzaefferer> which the log doesn't tell us
[13:23:59] <gnarf> that is setup to be done on clone
[13:24:10] <gnarf> on update, we might want to make a "grunt update" that is called
[13:24:27] <jzaefferer> well, prepare can do that already
[13:24:37] <gnarf> so no harm in calling prepare on every push?
[13:24:39] <jzaefferer> after the first prepare, further calls run a lot faster
[13:24:52] <jzaefferer> talking about tags anyway, so yeah, that's fine
[13:25:15] <jzaefferer> so what it actually needs to do...
[13:25:23] <jzaefferer> err
[13:25:25] <jzaefferer> nvm
[13:25:40] <gnarf> i just manually ran the prepare
[13:25:48] <jzaefferer> there's still the matter of figuring out which tag to pass `prepare`...
[13:26:12] <gnarf> can it only run one version at a time?
[13:26:24] <jzaefferer> can we get the error output from the server script into syslog?
[13:26:29] <jzaefferer> yeah, for now
[13:26:31] <gnarf> jzaefferer: no
[13:26:51] <gnarf> jzaefferer: because of the start-stop-daemon abstraction (which i suppose I could find other ways around, but it is a very nice utility)
[13:27:02] <gnarf> all output is just dropped in an init.d script
[13:27:10] <jzaefferer> should we just update download builder to catch uncaught exceptions and log to syslog?
[13:27:18] <gnarf> yes, that
[13:27:21] <jzaefferer> kk
[13:27:33] <gnarf> was typing that as you typed it :)
[13:27:35] <jzaefferer> using the simple logger thingy?
[13:27:39] <jzaefferer> which repo was that?
[13:28:07] <jzaefferer> just need something where its used already
[13:28:08] <gnarf>     "logger": "git://github.com/jquery/node-logger.git"
[13:28:15] <gnarf> require("logger").init("proccess-name")
[13:28:31] <gnarf> logger.log( "message has to be a string btw" );
[13:29:03] <gnarf> automatically interprets --console from argv too
[13:29:09] <gnarf> to dump to console instead
[13:29:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i wonder if we couldn't add a utility to have a "uncaught error" to node-logger
[13:29:59] <gnarf> seems all the projects are gonna want this
[13:31:08] <gnarf> jzaefferer: seems multiple versions has to be tackled at some point
[13:31:39] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yes, it does, after 1.9 is out
[13:31:44] <gnarf> jzaefferer: :)
[13:31:56] <jzaefferer> made that descision to get this one done at some point
[13:32:13] <jzaefferer> you'll update download.sh to run `grunt prepare`?
[13:32:17] <gnarf> jzaefferer: as far as what tag to prepare
[13:32:31] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yes - i'll do that now
[13:32:40] <jzaefferer> it currently defaults to master
[13:32:48] <jzaefferer> which is wrong, but I don't yet know how to fix that
[13:32:58] <jzaefferer> or where the value to pass should come from
[13:33:28] <gnarf> jzaefferer: maybe a url?
[13:33:48] <jzaefferer> like what?
[13:34:17] <gnarf> something on code.jquery.com
[13:34:28] <gnarf> updates with the jquery-ui release process
[13:34:54] <gnarf> (thought)
[13:35:21] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We should hard-code the value in the gruntfile.
[13:35:36] <jzaefferer> That's an option
[13:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> The download repo should know exactly what version it's serving.
[13:35:52] <jzaefferer> so once 1.9 is tagged, we just replace "master" with "1.9.0"
[13:35:53] <scott_gonzalez> We'll eventually have multiple options too.
[13:35:56] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:36:04] <jzaefferer> well, that's easy then
[13:36:17] <jzaefferer> gnarf: so just call `grunt prepare` whenever we push a tag
[13:40:00] <gnarf> jzaefferer: roger
[13:40:42] <jzaefferer> gnarf: great, looks like that's all we need to get this live once themeroller is done. Its serving now: http://jq02.jquery.com:3000/
[13:42:52] <gnarf> jzaefferer: that should be done btw - prepare should happen now
[13:52:29] <jzaefferer> gnarf: okay. Would have to actually change more then just pushing a new tag to test that now. We'll see...
[19:50:23] <kborchers> agcolom: added those pretty QuickNav styles for you :)
