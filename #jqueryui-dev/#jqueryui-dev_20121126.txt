[03:29:56] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, RFC, Farbtastic sets the input value when color is picked here https://github.com/mattfarina/farbtastic/blob/farbtastic-1/farbtastic.js#L193. I (as a farbtstatic user) would like to know when that happens. How do you think farbstatic should implement a way to alert user? Do you think sending a $(this).trigger("change") when it changes the color work?
[03:34:33] <rxaviers> Ideally, I should be able to notice that change without patching fb. But, I dont think it's currently possible, except if I pass a function as the callback (but, I need to re-implement in my endpoint what-fb-does-when-callback-is-an-object).
[03:37:16] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: change event seems reasonable, but a custom callback seems also fine. I'm not sure what "re-implement in my endpoint" means
[03:37:47] <rxaviers> custom like "change.farbtastic"?
[03:39:16] <rxaviers> If I dont patch farbtastic, I should be able to pass a function (instead of the input element) as the callback. In that case, fb does not handle the input value change and so on. But, it calls my function. So, I should be able to do what fb does (change input value and so on), then in the end of that I can do my-custom-on-change things.
[03:40:13] <rxaviers> I want to cleanup app/resources/themeroller from farbtastic codes
[03:40:49] <rxaviers> Then, cleanup the way TR and DB process the GET arguments. Then, fix the two usability issues to close the versions branch

[06:53:19] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, I am separating third parties libs from our code (eg. farbtastic from themeroller). What name would you guys prefere for a folder to hold that libs? a) `lib`, b) `vendor`?
[06:53:20] <rxaviers>  Note that in server-side code, we use `lib` to hold our own libraries
[06:54:07] <rxaviers> prefer*
[06:54:41] <rxaviers> In `rails` they use vendor to hold that kinda libs.
[06:55:35] <rxaviers> But, I dont think of any other name. Opened for ideas
[06:57:51] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: externals
[06:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> minus the s
[06:58:11] <rxaviers> great!

[07:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/release/changelog-shell
[07:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> generateChangelog() will get you the important automated stuff.
[07:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> This is why we have strict commit message guidelines.
[07:26:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah we have something similar but more ghetto, the hard part is the extra text to explain "this is WHY it's important and how you can work around it if you're affected"
[07:26:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, upgrade guide.
[07:26:48] <DaveMethvin> right
[07:26:51] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, was thinking about the changelog.
[07:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> The upgrade guide is 100% hand-rolled.
[07:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's a combination of looking at every single commit message and the changelog.
[07:27:20] <DaveMethvin> so what did you use to format it?
[07:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> markdown.
[07:27:27] <DaveMethvin> ok
[07:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, I guess my brain is still fried from the move.
[07:28:00] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/blob/master/page/upgrade-guide/1.9.md
[07:28:16] <DaveMethvin> perfect!
[07:28:20] <DaveMethvin> i liked your formatting
[07:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> `"toc": true` makes it generate the TOC with links, based on the headers.
[07:28:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah and that's convenient too
[07:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://groups.google.com/d/msg/free-aria/JhzJ3h8bVgg/Hp9Pp2ZmQmMJ :-/
[07:35:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i've been following that thread ‚Ä¶ i think :-/ sums it up rather well
[07:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> I really just don't understand why this guy thinks we should promote AccDC.
[07:35:58] <DaveMethvin> but it only took him SEVEN DAYS to do all that work!
[07:36:05] <DaveMethvin> :D
[07:36:29] <DaveMethvin> if he had done it in 6 days he could have rested a day and beeen a GOD
[07:36:36] <kborchers> lol
[07:37:05] <DaveMethvin> it's so much more fun to write your own project where you don't have to listen to anyone

[09:33:48] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: what do you think of this yellow? ( http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/orientationchange/)
[09:34:20] <scott_gonzalez> Looks fine.
[09:36:51] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: should we make it go into the XSL file?
[09:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> The styles?
[09:38:27] <agcolom> (currently I've put the style inside the div :  <div style="padding: 0.4em 15px; background: #FFF3A5; ">
[09:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> They should go into a stylesheet.
[09:39:15] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I was wondering whether you wanted to create a node for this like <warning>?
[09:40:01] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not. Descriptions are freeform HTML, we should just have a class that adds the styling.
[09:40:15] <agcolom> ok. 
[09:40:49] <agcolom> I've also noticed something with your selector description: 
[09:41:10] <agcolom> this one is fine: http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/data-selector/
[09:42:03] <agcolom> but http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/focusable-selector/ has an empty signature (which may be fine, I don't know) but the box then looks strange.
[09:42:33] <agcolom> the same happens with http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/tabbable-selector/
[09:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, so we should change the CSS.
[09:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go.
[09:45:11] <agcolom> yes, probably... 
[12:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> back
[12:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Looks like if we drop the bottom padding on the li.signaure to 0 then that gets rid of the grey box.
[12:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> Even looks good when there are parameters.
[12:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need to check other types of entries, but this might be an easy fix.
[12:23:39] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: johnbender had a TODO in that _createWidget() override to push a PR to UI to this._trigger( "init" ) from UI's _createWidget(). I guess you guys don't really want to emit <widget>init right after <widget>create, eh? (Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3602#issuecomment-10718520)
[12:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[12:24:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK. Then I'll just remove the override and implement init instead.
[12:25:02] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... but I think we have to keep it in the baseclass, because we have published a version of jQM that emits <widget>init and not just pageinit :(
[12:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> You didn't document it though, did you?
[12:26:09] <scott_gonzalez> You should really keep it out of the base class. It has 0 use.
[12:26:46] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Hmmm ... good point. I suppose depending on our kindness level at the time, we could add it back per-widget.
[12:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> There should be a REALLY good reason to add it to any widget.
[12:27:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: For sure.
[12:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> As it stands, it doesn't even sound like it was the right thing to do for page.
[12:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> It sounds like you should've added an event before pagecreate.
[12:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> And that should've been used for whatever custom hooking stuff people needed.
[12:28:02] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, it's only because all widgets start their enhancement in response to pagecreate.
[12:28:59] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and the order in which pagecreate handlers are attached can vary.
[12:29:26] <scott_gonzalez> So you sould've added something before pagecreate for all that stuff to listen to instead.
[12:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> Basically no widget should ever override _createWidget().
[12:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> We even have unit tests making sure that nothing in UI overrides it.
[12:30:27] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: pageinit is fired after pagecreate. The override chains up first and then _trigger()s.
[12:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> I understand that, but you don't care about the order of events compared to methods.
[12:30:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: But either way, it's achievable with _init() specifically because of that.
[12:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> You care about the relative order of pagecreate and pageinit.
[12:31:22] <scott_gonzalez> Just be aware that if you put it in _init(), you're changing the semantics of the event.
[12:31:53] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: How so?
[12:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> Today: elem.page().page().page() => 1 pageinit event
[12:32:14] <scott_gonzalez> Tomorrow: elem.page().page().page() => 3 pageinit events
[12:32:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Oh, that's right!
[12:32:48] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: That's good news! I was worried it would mess up everything... 
[12:33:19] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, elem.page().page().page() is pretty bad and it should have pretty bad consequences.
[12:33:46] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OOTH, elem.page().page( "destroy" ).page().page( "destroy" ).page() should work correctly.
[12:34:02] <scott_gonzalez> Why? Just the other day you were talking about encouraging re-initialization of some other widget.
[12:34:29] <scott_gonzalez> Re-initializing should never have bad consequences.
[12:35:08] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: "I have a great mind, but it's very short." -- Albert Einstein ... and mine isn't even that great.
[12:36:17] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Actually, now that I'm starting to recall, that case was a one-off for backwards compatibility.
[12:36:59] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Still, it's good you brought that up - leaves me pondering ...
[12:37:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... because nav, for example, unconditionally calls .page() on the page it's about to display.
[12:37:29] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That should stay that way ...
[12:37:42] <scott_gonzalez> So there you go :-P
[12:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> It's not the end of the world if page overrides _createWidget().
[12:38:24] <scott_gonzalez> But if we had method scoping, it'd be a private method.
[12:40:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Hmmm ... I guess that leaves only one choice ... WONTFIX :(
[12:42:44] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, I suppose we can "fix" it by moving it out of the base class and into page ... assuming my teammates agree. I know we documented pageinit, but I don't think we ever documented <anythingelse>init ...
[12:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> You should definitely move it out of the base class.
[12:43:32] <_|Nix|_> *nod*

[19:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, I blame jzaefferer 100% because he changed the release process to supposedly make this part easier.
[19:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's completely gone now :-P
[19:14:50] <DaveMethvin> that's a lot faster then
[19:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nope, it's steps 4+5 under jqueryui.com http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/59346425/Release%20Checklist
[19:15:54] <scott_gonzalez> It used to be generated by the release script.
[19:16:11] <DaveMethvin> should those "commit and push" be push --tags? I always forget that.
[19:16:37] <scott_gonzalez> That's under the "Finally" section.
[19:16:48] <scott_gonzalez> Everything is tagged at the end, so we can verify on stage.
[19:17:13] <DaveMethvin> i see, it's all one big try ... finally
[19:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[19:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure it's ok to just generate it now from the tag.

[19:27:14] <DaveMethvin> hey scott_gonzalez, heads up; i'm copying you on an email from some security folks at Johns Hopkins who have been researching security in jQuery. They had some questions about UI.
[19:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[19:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: that's crazy
[19:43:36] <DaveMethvin> so why *is* that thing doing an eval of an attribute?
[19:44:14] <DaveMethvin> i didn't know where that code was to see more context
[19:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> My guess is JSON
[19:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's basically like .data()
[19:44:42] <scott_gonzalez> but from like 1999 :-P
[19:44:46] <DaveMethvin> probably so,  you're right
[19:44:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to delete it right now.
[19:45:01] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think this was ever documented.
[19:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's certainly not on api.jqueryui.com or docs.jquery.com.
[19:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> And it's not used in any demos.
[19:45:41] <DaveMethvin> shh, sneak it out the back door
[19:45:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm honestly not even sure if I should file a ticket to remove it.
[19:45:55] <scott_gonzalez> I kinda just want to remove it and hope nobody notices :-)
[19:46:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> No tests for it either :-P
