[09:57:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! So, re https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7082 what do you think about the case where a radio button is off-page, and you can tab to it?
[09:58:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7082#issuecomment-34563070 and http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/163/
[09:58:26] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#1401 (master - d0fed72 : Vasu Bhardwaj): The build passed.

[09:58:26] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/19052248
[09:58:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If we choose to circumvent the spec, we should also introduce focus handling to make sure off-page radio buttons cannot be reached even via tabbing.
[09:59:08] <arschmitz> yeah i read that before its kinda complicated because you are correct about the tabbing but this can cause a very unwanted situation where you can tab to things you cant possible see and should not be able to get to
[09:59:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[09:59:39] <arschmitz> you can create something that similar in effect to a keyboard trap if we follow the spec
[09:59:54] <arschmitz> its not a true trap you can get out but you wont have any idea where you are
[10:00:47] <arschmitz> we also cannot restrict focus to the page
[10:01:10] <arschmitz> because you can have panels and tollbars with controls out side the page
[10:01:16] <arschmitz> that you need to be able to tab to
[10:01:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[10:01:53] <arschmitz> so im not really sure what the right thing to do here is
[10:02:19] <arschmitz> we dont want a keyboard trap but we cant restrict focus
[10:02:33] <arschmitz> this is a mess i cant belive has not come up in an issue before
[10:02:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, why not follow the spec, and if people set up such ill-conceived radio button groups, we can tell them that of course they won't work!
[10:03:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I think the reason it has not come up is that pages are all hidden except the active page.
[10:03:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The issue only appears if one of the radios is outside the page.
[10:04:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Normally, if all we had was pages, we could hide anything in the body that is not a page.
[10:04:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In fact, we can still do that, but that's kinda messy, because we'd have to intercept any injections occurring in between pages.
[10:05:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess people need to understand that our page paradigm has its limits, especially wrt. the spec.
[10:05:48] <arschmitz> yeah 
[10:06:04] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gfr1991 opened issue #7120: Jquery mobile and google Map 02http://git.io/4VhWFg
[10:06:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we cant hide anything in body that not a page
[10:06:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm not talking about external toolbars and panels. We control those, and we know they're /supposed/ to be "part of" the page.
[10:07:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm talking about accidental "debris" we find in there.
[10:07:18] <arschmitz> what is your deffinition of accidental debris
[10:07:29] <arschmitz> we allow people to put whatever they want in the body
[10:07:37] <arschmitz> but they are responsible for it
[10:08:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, if that's already established, then the example I give is not something for us to worry about.
[10:08:38] <arschmitz> i think we should just follow the spc
[10:08:39] <arschmitz> spec
[10:08:47] <arschmitz> and if anyone ever complains point at it
[10:09:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. In that case, I'll remove the page and dialog selectors from _getInputSet()
[10:09:25] <arschmitz> yup
[10:10:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: From a wider perspective, correct me if I'm wrong: The only reason we need to calculate the input set and do complicated things is that iOS < 6 doesn't cause the radio to get clicked when the label is clicked, right?
[10:11:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I ask because I was thinking: Why do we need to calculate the radio group at all? If clicking the label causes a click on the radio and a subsequent value change and change event, we can simply respond to that and save a lot of complexity, including having to duplicate radio-group-calculating code that is already bound to be present in the browser, right?
[10:12:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you need to to add remove the visiual classes
[10:12:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why? Does the outgoing radio not also trigger a change?
[10:13:11] <arschmitz> how it SHOULD work is when a radio is clicked it adds the class to it self and just remove the classes from all others in group
[10:14:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why not work exactly the same as a checkbox - assuming that the radio that loses the checked state also emits a change when another is clicked. I'm not sure this assumption holds.
[10:14:05] * _|Nix|_ go test that now
[10:14:30] <_|Nix|_> Just goes to show how much of a n00b I am ...
[10:18:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1181
[10:19:09] <arschmitz> there is no outgoing change
[10:19:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, there isn't.
[10:19:26] <_|Nix|_> *sigh*
[10:20:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's :checked
[10:20:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In CSS ...
[10:20:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, we wouldn't need to be informed of an outgoing change.
[10:20:49] <arschmitz> not supported in ie8
[10:21:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aha! So there's the crux of the matter.
[10:21:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its also a super slow selector just for the record
[10:21:31] <arschmitz> all psuedos are
[10:21:41] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[10:22:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so the original plan remains. Remove the page-and-dialog stuff ...
[10:22:21] <_|Nix|_> I'll get on it.
[10:22:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: unless you want to switch to use the one from new ui checkbox radio
[10:22:58] <arschmitz> because there are cases where ours will fail to find the right radios
[10:23:09] <arschmitz> i found them working on ui one on plane
[10:23:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Got a link to the UI one? I know you've pasted it a couple of times already, but could you please paste it again?
[10:24:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll run it through the tests I've made.
[10:24:16] <_|Nix|_> ... in the PR
[10:24:31] <arschmitz> sure just let me make sure its up to date i fixed stuff on plane and not sure i pushed fixes
[10:24:59] <_|Nix|_> OK.

[10:32:53] <arschmitz> the function to get the group is at the very top
[10:33:12] <arschmitz> and its used in the _toggleClasses method
[10:35:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[10:36:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is it safe to use nativeElement.form?
[10:36:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wasn't sure about that.
[10:36:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If that's safe, then that's definitely the way to go.
[10:36:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Waaay more efficient.
[10:39:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: unless there is something weird in a mobile im not aware of thats been in use in ui in some form for a LONG time and they support ie7
[10:40:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wish there was a way to check. I can't find it on caniuse.com
[10:42:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if you make a simple test page i can run it on a variety of old devices
[10:43:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://jsbin.com/husaziyo/4
[10:43:19] <arschmitz> that works
[10:43:28] <arschmitz> ill check it on a few and let you know
[10:43:33] <arschmitz> for now just assume it does
[10:44:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think it works. I checked iOS 4 and Android 2.3 and it's ther.e
[10:44:53] <arschmitz> ok then go with it 
[10:45:07] <_|Nix|_> Eeeexcellent ...
[10:45:07] <arschmitz> anything else is pretty edge
[10:47:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's a bug in the UI case. It should initialize radios as $( radio ), not $( [] ).
[10:48:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: A radio is always a member of its own group.
[10:48:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That was the original motivation for this fix.
[10:48:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no check where its used
[10:48:25] <arschmitz> in toggleClasses
[10:50:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, I understand, but how it's used should not affect this. If I were to use it somewhere else, it would fail. In fact, if I were to paste this into mobile, it would exhibit the same bug as the version currently in master.
[10:51:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The function should always return the correct radio group - which always includes itself.
[10:51:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the function works as intended its not meant to be copied and pasted directly i gave it as a refrence
[10:51:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: this.element in the widget is always toggled
[10:52:12] <arschmitz> the radio group just is used to know where to remove classes
[10:53:23] <_|Nix|_> Well, the function is certainly more succinct and more efficient than having to find each radio's parent form.
[10:53:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also you dont need to care if its a checkbox this way
[10:54:20] <arschmitz> because this.element is treated the same in both the radio and checkbox case
[11:06:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That function has failed the tests because it does not account for the fact that radios outside of a form may have the form="some-form" attribute set, in which case they belong to "some-form" even if they are outside that form.
[11:13:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: indeed i think we should check with the ui guys make sure there is not some historical reason this is not supported or if its a bug
[11:15:27] <arschmitz> not sure why it wouldn't be supported but cant hurt to check 
[11:15:42] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: Ping!
[11:15:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... if it's old code, it may predate the form attribute.
[11:16:09] <arschmitz> i didnt think that was new but maybe
[11:18:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, when it does $( form ).find(...) it should filter those that have a form attribute set to some other form.
[11:18:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, all in all, it does not account for the possible presence of the form attribute.
[11:25:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so it would appear so we should add this in unless they say there is some reason why not to
[11:25:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, looks like.
[11:27:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, their code does not account for possible funky form names/group names. I passed the form name and group name through $.mobile.path.hashToSelector and added things like <form id="the-[form]">...</form> to the unit tests.
[11:28:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm actually kinda wondering if it would be possible to get core to add this convert-id-to-selector regex.
[11:28:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because we use it in a bunch of places, and you can never just say $( "#" + element.attr( "id" ) )
[11:29:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That way, we wouldn't need to depend on jquery.mobile.path. Yes, I know, this function is misplaced, but the usage has its roots in nav.

[12:03:19] <rxaviers> arschmitz, (cc jzaefferer), I am curious to understand why we need diff bower.json?

[12:04:56] <rxaviers> arschmitz, can't we distinguish them by using dependencies vs. devDependencies?
[12:08:02] <arschmitz> rxaviers: as far as i know there might be more to this then i know to be honest i dont use bower in my own works scott_gonzalez would be better to ask about this as he is the one that i recall originally mentioning it 
[12:11:22] <rxaviers> ok
[12:11:36] <rxaviers> perhaps we could address that using those two params
[12:22:53] <arschmitz> rxaviers: im now convinced im crazy
[12:23:09] <rxaviers> :)
[12:23:09] <arschmitz> all i can see that would be different is the version should not be in the repo
[12:23:28] <arschmitz> only tags
[12:23:42] <arschmitz> this could be what i was remembering i mean it IS a difference 
[12:24:04] <rxaviers> version in the bower.json file or in the source files?
[12:24:11] <arschmitz> rxaviers: both
[12:26:24] <rxaviers> while in development, the source files version use the VERSION constant, and the bower.json version could use the same "pre" version that package.json uses.
[12:26:54] <rxaviers> on tags, the source files will have their VERSION const replaced, and the bower.json version will be updated just like what happens with package.json
[12:27:00] <rxaviers> arschmitz, does that work?
[12:28:45] <arschmitz> rxaviers: i think so though i looked back at a conversation with scott_gonzalez and he indicated it should be removed entirely in the repo
[12:29:10] <rxaviers> what should be removed entirely?
[12:29:30] <arschmitz> the version property
[12:29:35] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/bower/bower.json
