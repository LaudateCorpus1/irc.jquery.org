[02:52:30] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] package.json: grunt-jquery-content to 0.2.2 - Richard D. Worth
[05:52:54] <kborchers> rworth: ping
[05:55:24] <kborchers> rworth: does this make any sense? i feel like it's comparing two unrelated versions but i could be missing something https://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-wordpress/issues/2
[05:55:24] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2 on grunt-wordpress (kborchers; 8h, 31m ago): Mismatching Version error on wordpress-deploy
[06:02:11] <rworth> kborchers which repo are you deploying to which site?
[06:05:11] <kborchers> rworth: api.jquery.com
[06:05:24] <kborchers> deploying locally
[06:05:47] <rworth> have you done a git pull inside web-base-template ?
[06:06:04] <rworth> and does your package.json specify 1.0.0 for grunt-wordpress
[06:06:18] <rworth> and have you done an npm install in that folder since it has specified that
[06:06:25] <kborchers> i have not pulled web-base-template recently
[06:06:37] <kborchers> my package.json does have 1.0.0
[06:06:40] <kborchers>  and i have installed
[06:07:23] <rworth> do `npm ls`
[06:08:18] <kborchers> ├─┬ grunt-wordpress@1.0.0
[06:08:18] <kborchers> │ └── wordpress@0.1.1
[06:09:12] <rworth> try deploying to stage.api.jquery.com
[06:13:15] <ajpiano> rworth: did you see my message from last night?
[06:13:59] <rworth> ajpiano how can I reproduce?
[06:14:21] <ajpiano> ostensibly if you use the qunit index.html and take out that one line with the partial
[06:14:39] <ajpiano> it fails in wordpress validate
[06:17:52] <rworth> ajpiano not able to reproduce. I've got a clean checkout of learn.jquery.com, I
[06:18:16] <rworth> copied package.json and grunt.js and page/index.html from qunitjs.com
[06:18:23] <rworth> took that line out of page/index.html
[06:18:33] <rworth> created a suitable config.json and it worked
[06:18:53] <ajpiano> that doesn't really help me figure out whats broken :(
[06:19:13] <rworth> http://stage.learn.jquery.com/index/
[06:20:00] <kborchers> rworth: looks like it is deploying to stage just fine
[06:20:29] <rworth> kborchers in that case your local needs a more recent web-base-template I'd guess, caus the one on stage. is up-to-date
[06:21:13] <kborchers> rworth: gotcha ... so many moving parts to keep track of ... i'll get it eventually :) sorry to bother and i'll close that issue on scott's repo as well.
[06:21:14] <kborchers> thanks
[06:21:21] <rworth> np
[06:24:39] <ajpiano> lol rworth i realised what the problem was :|
[06:24:52] <ajpiano> when working on two computers, it's important to update the hosts file on *both* computers
[06:24:56] <rworth> haha
[06:25:02] <rworth> that would do it
[06:51:16] <rworth> nacin thanks for fixing that issue. Did you get a chance to look at http://stage.jquerymobile.com/resources/ that's a page with the name 'resources' . Should I create an issue for it?
[06:52:33] <nacin> rworth: I'll just fix it now, one second
[07:34:43] <nacin> rworth: should be working niw
[07:34:44] <nacin> now*
[07:35:09] <rworth> nacin awesome, thanks
[07:40:55] <rworth> nacin can you help me make menus highlight which page they're on? Should we be constructing actual wordpress menus via some function call ?
[07:53:01] <nacin> if you're linking to pages, you should probably use wp_page_menu()
[07:54:11] <jzaefferer> Hey nacin! Could you take another look at https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/37 ?
[07:54:12] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #37 on web-base-template (jzaefferer; 2d, 3h ago): Butchered category descriptions
[07:55:29] <nacin> ah yes. on that otday.
[07:55:31] <nacin> today.
[08:10:29] <nacin> rworth: I'm not making up api.jquerymobile.com, right? that exists?
[08:15:06] <rworth> yeah, that exists
[08:15:14] <rworth> or, it will
[08:15:21] <rworth> it's one of the new sites
[08:15:26] <rworth> like api.jqueryui.com
[08:15:36] <rworth> so, I guess what exists is stage.api.jquerymobile.com
[08:15:49] <rworth> the only site that exists like that today is api.jquery.com
[08:16:03] * rworth back in 1hr
[08:27:01] <kborchers> ok i'm going crazy. i blew up my local wordpress and started over and now when i try to grunt wordpress-deploy i get "Error: Unknown XML-RPC tag 'TITLE'"
[08:27:11] <kborchers> i have seen this before an know i'm missing a step
[08:27:13] <kborchers> any help?
[08:27:18] <ajpiano> kborchers: are your hosts setup properly
[08:27:22] <ajpiano> i just had the same problem :p
[08:27:34] <kborchers> i thought they were before i reinstalled wordpress
[08:27:36] <kborchers> let me check
[08:28:22] <kborchers> ajpiano: yeah, i think that looks fine
[08:28:56] <kborchers> doh
[08:29:01] <kborchers> i think i know what it is
[08:32:24] <kborchers> i moved wordpress into a different dir and didn't add that to the url in config.json
[08:32:29] <kborchers> working fine now
[08:32:32] <kborchers> need moar coffee
[08:32:47] <ajpiano> kborchers: how did you reinstall your wordpress
[08:33:27] <kborchers> ajpiano: just trashed it and reinstalled from the download
[08:34:10] <ajpiano> and then you just reconfigured the multisite and everything yourself?
[08:34:17] <ajpiano> or are you only working on one site
[08:34:28] <ajpiano> i started in yesterday trying to use the install script but didn't get too far
[08:35:01] <kborchers> i am only working on one site at a time and just change the theme manually ... no multisite set up here yet
[08:35:06] <ajpiano> ah
[08:35:36] <kborchers> figured i would wait for the install script to be finished before trying multisite
[08:36:38] <nacin> the install script should be "finished" in a bit, working on a readme and fixing one last bug
[08:36:54] <kborchers> nacin: nice
[08:37:04] <ajpiano> nacin: awesome!
[08:50:49] <jzaefferer> nacin: great. I need to redo my setup anyway, so gonna give the script a testrun
[08:51:59] <ajpiano> hey rworth by the way, the problem yesterday was twofold - not having the latest python *and* not having make/xcode
[09:18:44] <gnarf> oh btw, scott_gonzalez isn't here
[09:18:56] <gnarf> so opinion from jzaefferer rworth appreciated
[09:19:03] <gnarf> where's rworth?
[09:19:32] <gnarf> anyway - I fixed that last bug in jQuery Color.  Should I a) release 2.0RC1 - or just skip that RC and go to solid gold master?
[09:19:55] <gnarf> b) file a pull against UI effects core to land jQuery Color 2.0(RC1)?
[09:20:53] <kborchers> gnarf: rworth said back in an hour just a little over an hour ago
[09:21:32] <gnarf> i'll CC him in skype
[09:39:42] <gnarf> jzaefferer: you have an opinion on either a or b? ^^^^
[09:41:29] <jzaefferer> gnarf: start with 2.0.0 and go from there
[09:41:41] <jzaefferer> it won't be the only release either way
[09:41:58] <jzaefferer> did you get green swarm results yet?
[09:42:16] <gnarf> yup
[09:42:37] <gnarf> found out that .style.color = 'inherit' is apparently "illegal value" in IE6/7
[09:42:50] <gnarf> and that ie6/7 are very very annoying with this
[09:43:12] <gnarf> and since jQuery core wraps its .style[ key ] = value in a try { ... } catch {}
[09:43:15] <gnarf> I did the same
[09:44:19] <jzaefferer> ah, nice
[10:18:23] <nacin> ajpiano: rworth: jzaefferer: kborchers: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/
[10:18:38] <nacin> Looks like the readme code blocks are messed up, if someone wants to fix that, I'm going to lunch.
[10:18:49] <nacin> Otherwise, the installer works.
[10:19:17] <nacin> Only thing it does not handle is .htaccess, which will just be a sample file you can move into place.
[10:22:24] <ajpiano> nacin, i'll check this out right now, catch up with you after you eat
[11:33:24] <ajpiano> nacin, you back by any chance
[11:33:29] <nacin> yes
[11:33:42] <ajpiano> so the dir structure is not the one we dicussed yesterday right
[11:34:00] <ajpiano> the web-base-template gets cloned into the dir with the rest of wordpress
[11:34:01] <ajpiano> ?
[11:35:51] <nacin> yes
[11:55:28] <ajpiano> nacin: Fatal error: Call to undefined function insert_blog() in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/jqnetwork/web-base-template/install.php on line 78
[11:56:15] <ajpiano> the next line of code says to "Find nacin." so i'm just optimising
[11:56:16] <ajpiano> :p
[12:12:10] <nacin> ajpiano: remove define( 'MULTISITE', false ) from wp-config.php
[12:12:46] <nacin> that piece is no longer needed
[12:17:19] <ajpiano> nacin, success, it would seem!!
[12:25:20] <ajpiano> this is amazing
[12:46:27] <nacin> ajpiano: :)
[12:47:38] <ajpiano> the install never prompted me to delete it
[12:47:50] <ajpiano> but i guess you're gonna be removing it from there anyway
[12:48:06] <nacin> right, it is no longer part of web-base-template/wp-config-sample.php
[12:48:32] <ajpiano> yes it is :[
[12:48:48] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/wp-config-sample.php
[12:49:38] <nacin> must have missed a git add. handling it.
[12:49:40] <nacin> thanks!
[12:50:21] <ajpiano> ah,  figured! np
[13:01:45] <ajpiano> oh no
[13:02:00] <ajpiano> i just tried to use "clean" wrong and it ate my entire project directory :|
[13:02:18] <ajpiano> luckily i have a backup
[14:13:58] <rworth> nacin any thoughts on top-nav menu item highlighting?
[14:14:07] <rworth> meanwhile, seems time for me to try this install
[14:14:20] <nacin> rworth: sure, so, what are the nav menus linking to?
[14:14:27] <nacin> are they all Pages in WordPress?
[14:14:33] <rworth> not always
[14:14:36] <rworth> about 80% of the time
[14:14:48] <nacin> example of a mix?
[14:15:01] <rworth> sometimes other sites, like jquery.com links to api.jquery.com and learn.jquery.com and plugins.jquery.com and jquery.com/download
[14:15:21] <rworth> and each of those sites would have the same links
[14:15:23] <ajpiano> on learn, i need it to be the actual categories that exist on the site
[14:15:33] <rworth> currently by including the same menu-header-jquery.php
[14:15:36] <nacin> so, hardcoding these make the most sense.
[14:15:40] <rworth> to reduce duplicating
[14:15:47] <nacin> it's all in one final?
[14:16:26] <rworth> each top-level site theme has its own menu-header-... .php
[14:16:36] <rworth> jquery, ui, mobile, qunit, etc.
[14:17:05] <ajpiano> rworth: scott_gonzalez what do i have to do to to get it to recurse subdirectories? i am forgetting a crucial thing.
[14:17:09] <rworth> ajpiano that shouldn't be a problem. We can loop through the categories in that file
[14:17:25] <rworth> path/** ?
[14:17:36] <ajpiano> ahh
[14:18:10] <nacin> rworth: so, there's an entire menus system in WP, but it is UI-based. the API behind it is not particularly strong, but more so, there's no XML-RPC bridge.
[14:18:31] <rworth> yeah, we used it early on and found some of those limitations
[14:18:38] <rworth> and I remember you mentioning in person as well
[14:18:58] <nacin> it works great, but it isn't very portable when you are using XML-RPC and not the admin interface
[14:19:01] <rworth> it needn't be XML-RPC related in any case
[14:19:07] <rworth> menus are part of web-base-template
[14:19:49] <rworth> I'd be fine hard-coding a menu in php as a programmatic creation of a wordpress menu, if that makes the implementation simpler
[14:20:16] <nacin> seems like it is more theme-based than data-based anyway
[14:20:16] <rworth> or we could just code something up...
[14:20:22] <rworth> indeed
[14:20:36] <rworth> this would be something shared across top-level site themes
[14:20:42] <rworth> just as we share footers and functions
[14:20:53] <nacin> so, we should code something up.
[14:21:29] <rworth> can you help with that? If I tried, it'd be an if statement embedded inside each <li> ;)
[14:21:52] <nacin> sure, not a problem, I can write it pretty quickly. I need to get an idea of what the different types of links are. just "Page" and "URL not pointing to this particular site" are the only two I can see.
[14:22:05] <rworth> that's all we've got atm
[14:22:08] <nacin> "URL not pointing to this particular site" never needs to be highlighted, as it is a "Page" on another site
[14:22:39] <rworth> and so for page we'd specify the slug?
[14:22:50] <nacin> slug is fine.
[14:24:03] <rworth> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/30a8148eb0608b02c059b31a9cf1263ccd0ecbb9 shows what we had just before I finished sharing the last menu. When each site had its own menu, the current-menu-item class was hard-coded on the site's link
[14:24:03] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on web-base-template by Richard D. Worth (6h, 45m ago): qunitjs theme: Added top-level menu
[14:24:54] <rworth> hmm, but page doesn't really make sense if we share this code as much as I'm suggesting we would
[14:25:08] <rworth> unless we want to include a site id with the slug :/
[14:25:18] <rworth> full url seems a lot cleaner
[14:26:07] <rworth> notice how all the urls have to include the hostname (not root-relative page links) so the same menu-header file can be used on qunitjs.com and api.qunitjs.com
[14:27:09] <nacin> which menu is this for?
[14:27:29] <nacin> The top global one, or the one within?
[14:27:38] <nacin> is it just the same links for every site?
[14:28:02] <nacin> Okay. I guess there are some differences.
[14:28:22] <nacin> We will code it as one big file in the jquery theme and make it clever.
[14:28:52] <rworth> this is for the menu just above the page content
[14:29:09] <rworth> different for every site, but the same for sites that have the same visual theme
[14:29:43] <rworth> see http://stage.qunitjs.com/
[14:30:00] <nacin> I see three different menus here: http://cl.ly/0r0M0z1A0g1o2g1a1m1e
[14:30:12] <nacin> top left (which seems like it is global and does not change), top right, and then bottom
[14:30:14] <rworth> that's the old design :/
[14:30:38] <nacin> oops
[14:30:39] <nacin> duh
[14:31:17] <nacin> okay, so Home, Api Doc, Cookbook, Extens.
[14:31:20] <rworth> yup
[14:31:23] <nacin> Gooot it.
[14:31:27] <nacin> I will run with this.
[14:31:32] <rworth> cool, thanks
[14:31:49] <rworth> menu-header-*.php in /themes/jquery/ has most current
[14:36:39] <nacin> so all of them are in themes/jquery/?
[14:36:48] <nacin> and the other menu-header-* files are unnecessary?
[14:37:17] <rworth> the other menu-header.php files include them. Do you know a better way to do it?
[14:37:35] <rworth> I thought this was the best way we had for 3-4 child themes to share something declared in the parent theme
[14:38:25] <rworth> we're doing the same thing for shared footers across top-level theme sites
[14:38:53] <nacin> I can look through how they are all implemented.
