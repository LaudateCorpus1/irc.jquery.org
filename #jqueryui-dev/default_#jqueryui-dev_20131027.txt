[21:52:56] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Ping~!
[21:53:33] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: Hi, Jasper. I have a question.
[21:53:51] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: I think that you guys don't need the PRs for 1-4 branch in api.jquerymobile.com yet. Right?
[21:54:13] <Hyunsook> uGoMobi: It seems that nobody doesn't check the PRs in api.jquerymobile.com.
[22:10:28] <arschmitz> Hyunsook: no those PR's are checked we have just been really busy trying to finish up everything
[22:11:33] <arschmitz> Hyunsook: the 1.4 branch is exactly where we need PR's right now that branch will become the live site when we release 1.4 final
