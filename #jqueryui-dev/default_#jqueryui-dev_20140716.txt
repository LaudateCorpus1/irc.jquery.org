[06:09:30] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, give me 2-3 minutes then I'm good.

[08:03:33] <jperrault> tj_vantoll: I'm looking at I'm looking at http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10126.  I'd like to confirm the "correct" behavior:  If a header is active when a new header is added, should the currently active header be de-activated and the new header made active?
[08:04:33] <jperrault> as it is, the code leaves the currently active header open, which as an end user is what I would expect.

[08:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: The active header should stay active.
[08:23:22] <scott_gonzalez> Also note that `active: "none"` is an invalid value.
[08:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> It should be `active: false`

[09:07:27] <dcherman> how long should receiving a password reset email from the bug tracker take?  tried resetting mine ~1.5 hours ago and still haven't received an email.  it's also telling me that it sent a password even when i put in a wrong email address, so hopefully nothing is actually happening there
[09:48:25] <Omar-> arschmitz: hi again
[09:48:39] <arschmitz> Omar-: hi
[09:48:47] <Palestinian> how are you today?
[09:49:17] <arschmitz> Palestinian: good your self?
[09:49:40] <Palestinian> arschmitz: I'm fine thanks :)
[09:49:59] <Palestinian> I'm reading through your onPage
[09:50:56] <Palestinian> What about the events in line 31-36?
[09:51:01] <Palestinian> arschmitz ^ ^
[09:51:19] <Palestinian> scott_gonzalez: buenas tardes ;)
[09:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> Palestinian: hi
[09:51:58] <arschmitz> Palestinian: what about those events?
[09:52:02] <Palestinian> scott_gonzalez: how are you?
[09:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> good
[09:52:40] <Palestinian> arschmitz: I'm trying to understand the code, why have you mentioned those events specificly? not all pagecontainer events?
[09:53:11] <arschmitz> Palestinian: those are events that were previously triggered on the prevPage rather then the toPage
[09:55:59] <Palestinian> arschmitz: hmmm.. ok got it
[09:56:26] <Palestinian> btw, you have an extra comma after jquery in line 21
[10:00:17] <arschmitz> thank you
[10:02:01] <Palestinian> arschmitz: regarding this https://github.com/jquery/demos.jquerymobile.com/pull/11
[10:02:08] <Palestinian> where shall I add the code?
[10:02:14] <Palestinian> i mean in which repo?
[10:02:48] <arschmitz> Palestinian: there is almost no reason to ever do a pr to the demos.jquerymobile.com repo thats auto generated
[10:03:05] <arschmitz> Palestinian: all demos prs are in jquery-mobile repo
[10:03:21] <Palestinian> arschmitz: I didn't know that, I thought any modifications should go under demos repo
[10:04:56] <arschmitz> no always jquery-mobile
[10:10:26] <s5fs> dcherman: bug tracker password reset emails should be nearly immediate. however, if you enter the wrong email address, the website will never tell you.
[10:21:17] <Palestinian> arschmitz: thanks :)
[10:22:42] <Palestinian> gtg now
[10:22:46] <Palestinian> take care
[10:22:50] <Palestinian> bye

[15:34:07] <hkaiser> hey, question: the new selectmenu (JQueryUI 1.11) is cool but misses a lot of customization options which were available in previous development versions (on Nagel's github)
[15:34:15] <hkaiser> are there any plans to re-add those ?
[15:35:12] <arschmitz> hkaiser: like?
[15:36:03] <hkaiser> arschmitz: maxHeight, handleWidth, different dropdown styles
[15:36:35] <arschmitz> hkaiser: i would say unlikely
[15:36:48] <hkaiser> arschmitz: what's the rationale?
[15:37:04] <arschmitz> hkaiser: most of those can be done simply using other options or just css
[15:37:55] <hkaiser> well, I can see that some of those can be done using css, but other options? not sure
[15:38:26] <hkaiser> arschmitz: is there a way to access the dropped down div?
[15:38:49] <hkaiser> arschmitz: before it actually opens so that we could change styles?
[15:39:28] <arschmitz> hkaiser: css is generally your best bet to change a style
[15:39:51] <hkaiser> sure, if you can access the dic
[15:39:55] <hkaiser> div*
[15:40:07] <arschmitz> what do you mean access?
[15:40:26] <hkaiser> what selector can I use to access the dropped down element
[15:40:39] <hkaiser> before it opens
[15:46:21] <arschmitz> hkaiser: the menu has the class ui-selectmenu-menu ui-front
[15:46:33] <arschmitz> oops ignore ui-front
[15:46:48] <arschmitz> copy and paste mistake
[15:47:05] <hkaiser> arschmitz: thanks!
[15:47:15] <arschmitz> hkaiser: no problem
[15:49:18] <hkaiser> arschmitz: another q
[15:49:50] <hkaiser> arschmitz: all drop down menus have the same styles, is there a way to get the one for a particular selectmenu?
[15:52:07] <scott_gonzalez> hkaiser: http://api.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/#method-menuWidget
[15:52:16] <arschmitz> hkaiser: it has an id generated based on the id of the select menu 
[15:52:20] <scott_gonzalez> Reading the documentation for whatever widgets you're using will go a long way.
[15:53:15] <hkaiser> scott_gonzalez: I read the docs and still can't find the piece I'm looking for - care to explain?
[15:53:24] <hkaiser> arschmitz: it has no id
[15:53:38] <scott_gonzalez> I just answered your question.
[15:53:44] <scott_gonzalez> Use the menuWidget method.
[15:54:19] <hkaiser> scott_gonzalez: I'm not interested in accessing the menu element, but the drop down element
[15:54:34] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know what you mean by drop down element.
[15:54:53] <hkaiser> the div which is openened when you click on the handle
[15:55:20] <scott_gonzalez> That's the menu.
[15:55:30] <hkaiser> scott_gonzalez: ok, good to know :-P
[15:55:36] <hkaiser> thanks guys
