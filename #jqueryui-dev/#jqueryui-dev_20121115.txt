[00:03:38] <po_taka-work> hello
[00:03:56] <po_taka-work> I need to "wrap" datepicker -updateDatepicker method, how to do it ?
[00:04:48] <po_taka-work> something like
[00:04:48] <po_taka-work> _updateDatepicker() {
[00:04:49] <po_taka-work> parent._updateDatepicker();
[00:04:49] <po_taka-work> // some my code
[00:04:49] <po_taka-work> }
[00:05:02] <po_taka-work> any suggestions ?
[00:37:40] <po_taka-work> nvm got it working :)
[00:37:40] <po_taka-work> if anyone need it I will share my code with pleasure :)
[04:22:28] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[04:22:28] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - git core build #213: FIXED in 14 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/213/

[05:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov DaveMethvin: We don't support: body { overflow: scroll; } do we?
[05:18:13] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: this is the only mention I can find: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8048
[05:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> I know we have this note in the docs too: Note: jQuery does not support getting the position coordinates of hidden elements or accounting for borders, margins, or padding set on the body element.
[05:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> But it doesn't mention overflow.
[05:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> I thought position and overflow on the body were in the list as well.
[05:20:08] <DaveMethvin> since we've marked it patchwelcome i think it probably belongs there
[05:20:20] <DaveMethvin> since it's broken, at least in ie8
[05:29:45] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: IE8 sucks
[05:32:15] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: The real problem in the ticket you listed is that $(document).width() isn't a real thing
[05:33:40] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i didn't see that
[05:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8817 is wontfix, correct?
[05:35:32] <mikesherov> It just kinda is a thing we pretend exists
[05:36:54] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: z-index bugs caused by non-web content and plugins are wontfix, IMO
[05:37:34] <mikesherov> If userland wants to iframe hack things, thats their perogative
[05:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that's what I thought we discussed, just wanted to confirm.
[05:38:02] <mikesherov> We should probably build a wontfix page with workarounds
[05:38:42] <mikesherov> Got it.
[05:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone else die a little when they see a full document with a doctype, head, body, etc. in a fiddle?
[05:43:50] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I can't log in to splunk.
[05:44:10] <scott_gonzalez> My existing password doesn't work and the temp password doesn't work :-/
[05:49:42] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: no! I do that as well ;-)
[05:52:43] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Yeah I die a little.  I'm also somewhat amazed at how well browsers handle that.  The examples pretty much always still work.
[05:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that always surprises me too.
[05:53:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm always skeptical though and delete all the superfluous stuff to make sure the bug still exists :-P
[05:54:59] <tj_vantoll> Yeah.
[06:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Does that IE8 opacity CSS craziness fix http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6727 and http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6059 ?
[06:05:50] <tj_vantoll> IE8 has a bug that their opacity filter is not inherited by children that are not position: static.  That is what is causing both #6727 & #6059.  I tried and adding this (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/374/files) has no effect.
[06:06:20] <tj_vantoll> The only real fix is to explicitly apply the filter to those children.
[06:06:27] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I said earlier, IE8 sucks
[06:07:01] <tj_vantoll> Here's the fix for #6059 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/themes/base/jquery.ui.theme.css#L44
[06:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Right, but if we land the IE8-specific opacity, does that also fix it?
[06:07:31] <tj_vantoll> No.
[06:08:16] <tj_vantoll> Try this in IE8 http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/R8Jqx/13/
[06:08:35] <tj_vantoll> .ui-state-disabled {
[06:08:35] <tj_vantoll> Â  Â Â -ms-filter:"progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=35)";
[06:08:35] <tj_vantoll> }
[06:08:35] <tj_vantoll> is used and the slider still does not appear opaque.
[06:09:49] <tj_vantoll> If you uncomment the fix I have in there:
[06:09:49] <tj_vantoll> .ui-slider.ui-state-disabled .ui-slider-handle,
[06:09:49] <tj_vantoll> .ui-slider.ui-state-disabled .ui-slider-range {
[06:09:49] <tj_vantoll> Â  Â Â filter: Alpha(Opacity=35);
[06:09:49] <tj_vantoll> }
[06:09:50] <tj_vantoll> it will.
[06:09:54] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.7.x core build #118: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.7.x%20core/118/
[06:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> meh, ok
[06:10:18] <mikesherov> Hmm. filter: inherit seems like a workable solution?
[06:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> That's just annoying.
[06:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, why do they not inherit by default?
[06:11:02] <mikesherov> Ask CSSWG
[06:11:28] <mikesherov> They're cascading stulesheets, not Inheriting style sheets!
[06:11:46] <mikesherov> initial value is probably not inherit
[06:11:58] <tj_vantoll> mikesherov Yeah filter: inherit works and that's a lot better.
[06:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> Well, filter is IE-only, right? So it'd really be "ask IE"
[06:12:32] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Should we do the same for button?
[06:12:38] <tj_vantoll> Yeah
[06:12:53] <mikesherov> well... filter is now CSS but for something different. But that's a whole other can of worms
[06:13:12] <mikesherov> I mean I think a good generic rule would be:
[06:13:39] <mikesherov> .ui-state-disabled * {filter:inherit;}
[06:13:56] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: tj_vantoll: ^
[06:15:10] <scott_gonzalez> Seems reasonable.
[06:15:40] <mikesherov> Understand though that if an element is positioned to be outside its container, it still inherits opacity
[06:15:58] <mikesherov> That's the only gotcha I think of
[06:16:06] <tj_vantoll> Sec, I think there's a problem with that approach *looking*
[06:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> But that would be the case for other browsers too, right?
[06:16:52] <tj_vantoll> Looks pretty good in IE8 - http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/CFgDL/2/.
[06:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...
[06:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's actually multiplying.
[06:19:37] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try something.
[06:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> I guess not: http://jsfiddle.net/cqQBx/
[06:22:59] <mikesherov> Beg
[06:22:59] <mikesherov> Brb
[06:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> Something is happening to the button in your fiddle though.
[06:23:18] <scott_gonzalez> The text fades out even more when using inherit.
[06:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's not a correct test, is it?
[06:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> The nested elements need to be positioned.
[06:25:44] <scott_gonzalez> Still works, not sure what's going on with the button.
[06:26:28] <tj_vantoll> Correct.  But using .ui-state-disabled * { filter: inherit; } will apply the filter globally.  That might have adverse effects since filter is now a real speced CSS property - http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/filters/understanding-css/.
[06:28:57] <scott_gonzalez> filter: inherit\9; to target IE7+8 ?
[06:30:21] <tj_vantoll> Only need 8, but I suppose it wouldn't hurt to hit 7.
[06:31:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think there's an IE8-only CSS hack.
[06:32:01] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I don't think so either.

[07:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea what's going on.

[07:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> Dropping oldIE just keeps looking better and better...
[07:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's non-breaking space vs. normal space.
[07:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this is interesting. The dialog test doesn't fail if you run the test alone.
[07:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've got a workaround for the dialog failure. This will probably work for the datepicker failures too.

[08:48:09] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to get us green on TestSwarm, so that I can add the rest of the 1-9-stable tests.
[08:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> That way we can feel good about the 1.9.2 release.
[08:49:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should look for shorhand methods too, though as you mention, any use is likely limited to places that don't require namespacing.
[08:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> But we should stop using them anyway.
[08:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> Event shorthands will either be deprecated or at least modular.
[08:51:00] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:51:37] <jzaefferer> the 1.9.2 release should be pretty much the same process as 1.9.1, without the bugs, right?
[08:51:52] <jzaefferer> shouldn't matter that its on a branch and has cherry-picks?

[11:08:37] <agcolom> It was a major breakthrough for me to understand this!
[11:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> I think there's one or two widgets in Mobile that use custom event prefixes.
[11:08:59] <agcolom> yes, can I just go 0.5.14 in one go?
[11:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> For those, you'll just need to add event-prefix="foo" in the <entry> node.
[11:09:09] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[11:09:23] <agcolom> excellent... hope to get time tomorrow morning....
[11:09:37] <scott_gonzalez> If you have type attributes in <event> nodes, you can remove them.
[11:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> I just removed all of them from UI.
[11:09:54] <agcolom> ok, will check...
[11:11:03] <agcolom> so now, all code examples can be generated automatically (widget options, methods and events)?
[11:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> yup

[12:26:07] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I haven't heard anything from Hans for both selectmenu and dialog. I can wait a bit more or ping him again, but we shouldn't wait too long either. Can you take a look at the comments here? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/794#issuecomment-10228888
[12:33:03] <kborchers> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez i will have a lot of time to work this weekend so if you have anything other than wrapping up my changes on Progressbar, let me know. Is there still work to do on Menubar?
[12:43:20] <jzaefferer> kborchers: there's a ton of work on Menubar, yes
[12:43:35] <jzaefferer> kborchers: at this point, helping with moving UI and QUnit sites to the new CSS framework would be a big help
[12:44:15] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[12:44:17] <doesallmagic> joern.zaefferer: Selectmenu: Fix testswarm job title
[12:45:32] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, i saw the discussions about that in the content meeting. i thought i read that as johnkpaul was focusing on the transition of all of those but i can work on sites too. what ever is most important right now
[12:52:02] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer force-pushed dialog-review from c5c54a5 to 3cbca20: http://git.io/BnVy7g
[12:52:02] <jquicommit> jquery-ui/dialog-review 3cbca20 JÃ¶rn Zaefferer: Dialog: Focus tabbable only when dialog lost focus before.
[12:54:08] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8614 would be good for 1.10.
[12:54:52] <jzaefferer> kborchers: if you can't make progress on sites, getting help with dialog tickets would also be good: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/10?P=dialog
[12:58:34] <jzaefferer> kborchers: also related to dialog changes, porting the ui-front approach to other widgets: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4203
[13:12:36] <_|Nix|_> Hey! What's the effect of instantiating the same widget twice on a given element? Does the factory catch that, before creating the .data( "ns-widgetname" ) item?
[13:14:18] <scott_gonzalez> It will call _init() a second time (and _setOptions() if a hash is provided).
[13:14:33] <scott_gonzalez> It will NOT call _create() a second time.
[13:14:45] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Will it overwrite the data item?
[13:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's the same instance.
[13:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> It calls instance.init().
[13:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't change .data() at all.
[13:15:37] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Awesome!
[13:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> In 99% of cases (widget's that don't have _init()), it's the same as just calling the option method.
[13:16:30] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: using button inside dialog for the close buttons means by default we get ui-state-default: http://bassistance.de/i/3189e2.png
[13:16:32] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and I'm about to map _init() to refresh() for mobile's controlgroup.
[13:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: that seems fine
[13:20:57] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: that way we also get a "close" tooltip, which wasn't there before
[13:21:15] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:25:27] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[13:25:50] <mikesherov> I think this is landable now: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/820 just want confirm before I pull the trigger
[13:25:59] <mikesherov> congrats on your move gtw
[13:26:01] <mikesherov> btw
[13:26:50] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Yeah, I just wanted the QUnit.reset() calls removed.
[13:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> If you scroll way up, you'll see a question from me :-P
[13:27:14] <scott_gonzalez> Asking if you wanted me to respond to the PR and verify that the tests fail before the patch.
[13:27:53] <mikesherov> sure, what do you want instead of the Qunit.reset() calls?
[13:28:01] <mikesherov> I can verify the failing tests
[13:29:09] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^

[13:31:29] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: any thoughts? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/794#issuecomment-10228888
[13:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Should be able to just destroy the instance instead of resetting the fixture.
[13:32:49] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: that's what I was thinking
[13:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We should really try to get VoiceOver working. Also, what about #3 from the previous comment?
[13:34:14] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I'm going to make that change and just attribute it to jpka
[13:34:40] <scott_gonzalez> That's fine. Just leave a comment letting him know what you changed, so he knows for the future.
[13:34:55] <mikesherov> yup :-)
[13:37:05] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.7.x core build #119: STILL FAILING in 39 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.7.x%20core/119/
[13:37:10] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I can compare our implementation to the modified dialog by Hans. If it doesn't work in Hans' version either, we can ignore the issue? If that isn't good enough, I'd like to move ahead for now anyway, get all my changes into a single branch and revisit the ARIA stuff later.
[13:37:47] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, that sounds good. We shouldn't not land anything just because of VoiceOver.
[13:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just saying we shouldn't say "We won't fix VoiceOver if it requires any hacks at all"
[13:38:42] <jzaefferer> okay
[13:38:48] <scott_gonzalez> I agree that we probably don't want to use live regions to get VoiceOver support though.
[13:39:00] <scott_gonzalez> That seems really ghetto.
[13:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> Live regions for autocomplete is annoying, but sane.
[13:39:44] <kborchers> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez ok, i will look into those specific tickets and dialog tickets this weekend after wrapping up progressbar
[13:39:53] <scott_gonzalez> Since the content is completely removed from the text field/menu.
[13:39:56] <jzaefferer> Next up would be those two tickets: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7861 http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7862 - I'll go through those issues, see if I can reproduce any of them
[13:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's good. Those are the two things that Drupal cares about.
[13:40:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting close to being able to work on dialog again :-)
[13:40:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm slowly getting TestSwarm green :-)
[13:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> My whitespace fix for the dialog tests worked out.
[13:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> So now I'll try the same for datepicker.
[13:46:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: nice. Can you confirm this real quick? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/795#r2145307
[13:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> crap, outdated comment.
[13:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> Any idea what that was?
[13:48:14] <scott_gonzalez> Well, obviously you do.
[13:49:38] <jzaefferer> its actually not outdated
[13:49:46] <jzaefferer> but not linking to the right spot anyway
[13:49:57] <jzaefferer> about "//Â TODOÂ whyÂ areÂ handlesÂ passedÂ byÂ _setOption??"
[13:51:09] <scott_gonzalez> yup, sounds right
[13:51:23] <scott_gonzalez> seems good bro :-)
[13:51:35] <jzaefferer> \o/
[13:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> No fall-throughs, that means we're not supposed to use a switch :-P
[13:52:09] <jzaefferer> ha
[13:52:29] <jzaefferer> we need a chaos monkey for override tests: set _setOption back to the original and see if any tests fail
[13:52:51] <jzaefferer> the dialogClass test was only checking init
[13:53:42] <scott_gonzalez> Well, what we need is a full test suite :-P

[14:53:56] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez: any idea why this would be slowing down the destroy method a ton? https://gist.github.com/53cfb1794432b521dc36 - testsuite takes 30s instead of 3s
[14:55:28] <scott_gonzalez> Because you're recursively destroying.
[14:55:59] <scott_gonzalez> Wait, no, I'm reading the code wrong.
[14:58:10] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe reflows because the dialog isn't hidden first anymore?
[15:00:38] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: could be, will check again; unrelated, any idea why dialog is toggling a ui-dialog-disabled in _setOption, but not on _create?
[15:01:04] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: we don't style that class
[15:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> Probably just old busted code. We're not supposed to add widget-specific disabled classes anymore.
[15:02:52] <jzaefferer> just remove it then?
[15:03:03] <jzaefferer> saves me the trouble of writing a test, too
[15:04:50] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: just remove it?
[15:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[15:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you remember which server has the site repo checkouts?
[15:09:44] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'm not sure. I think its a different one then the server running WordPress

[15:16:26] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: would appreciate another review round for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/795 - I'm done in that branch, will do the screenreader testing tomorrow (compare against Hans' dialog, check the two tickets), then land the whole bunch in master and start working through tickets
[15:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll see if I can track down these site checkouts. Then I'll do another round of review.
[15:17:52] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: actually, I'd look through tickets first, to see if I ended up fixing something. But put it all into the dialog branch, instead of keeping dialog and dialog-review
[15:17:56] <jzaefferer> ttyl
[15:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> later
[15:36:18] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: any idea when we are meeting with mike about API this week?
[15:37:57] <Dave_Stein> meant to ask that sooner in the day but kept getting caught up in things... guess i'll talk to you tomorrow when it's not post-work-hours :)
[15:38:22] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we were able to find a time this week that worked for all of us.
[15:38:38] <Dave_Stein> ah you're here was about to turn off comp ha
[15:38:44] <Dave_Stein> okay
[15:39:03] <Dave_Stein> hopefully early next week then or we'll have more suspense over the holiday weekend
[15:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm loading up the truck on Tuesday, moving on Wednesday, Thanksgiving on Thursday :-P
[15:40:36] <Dave_Stein> okay monday or post-thanksgiving it is
[15:40:38] <scott_gonzalez> Mike wanted to do it at night anyway.
[15:40:44] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[15:40:47] <scott_gonzalez> Monday could work.
[15:41:06] <Dave_Stein> i can do any night pretty much seeing as im attached to my cell. he works in NYC right?
[15:41:10] <scott_gonzalez> If we're doing it after work, It's gotta be like 9pm for me.
[15:41:17] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[15:41:19] <Dave_Stein> you're in chicago?
[15:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> Raleigh, NC
[15:41:31] <scott_gonzalez> Moving to York, PA.
[15:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be in NY for Thanksgiving though :-P
[15:41:44] <Dave_Stein> haha
[15:41:48] <Dave_Stein> i'll be in VA
[15:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers and gnarf are in (well, near) Chicago.
[15:42:14] <Dave_Stein> okay i confused your cities
[15:42:44] <Dave_Stein> well if the call isn't too late past 7est i can prob meet mike in city and speaker call you but if its 9 it'll prob just end up cells or skype at home
[15:43:00] <Dave_Stein> anyone else gonna be on it?
[15:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> I think he'd be home for the call.
[15:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> Don't think so.
[15:43:19] <Dave_Stein> k
[15:43:55] <Dave_Stein> well at least now that i'm working on UI from work I can keep the pressure going for 2.0 unlike last time
[15:44:15] <Dave_Stein> it helps that i'm off of feature building here and onto making things better in general so i don't have crazy deadlines keeping me away
[15:44:32] <Dave_Stein> plus a few people are are dying for better UI mobile support ;)
[15:45:17] <Dave_Stein> all in all I'm just excited to get 2.0 rolling and with that I'll be off to get dinner with the girlfriend/fiance
[15:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> Me too, 2.0 can't come soon enough.
[15:45:34] <scott_gonzalez> Enjoy dinner.
