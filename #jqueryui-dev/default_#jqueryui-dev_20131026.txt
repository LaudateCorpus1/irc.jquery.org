[08:56:19] <agcolom> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_ anyone around?
[09:00:17] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: just in case you're around, regarding the api docs for mobile, we have master (currently for 1.3) and the 1-4 branch. If a page and its resources does not appear in the 1-4 branch, is it because it has been removed of because it will be what there is currently in master?
[09:01:44] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I've spotted a pb in the demo center. Please ping me if you see this. I've emailed you but not sure I used the correct address...
[09:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It's been removed.
[09:05:08] <agcolom> ok thanks! now I need to find out why! 
[09:06:13] <agcolom> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_ do you know why the icons have been removed from the reference section in the api docs on the 1-4 branch?

[09:59:32] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1119/files?w=1 should fix 9379

[09:59:41] <mikesherov> just want to make sure it's sane
[10:00:14] <mikesherov> now draggable augments the position of the draggable when scroll happens
[10:00:55] <mikesherov> so we no longer need to cache the scroll position on drag to determine how to augment the generated position

[10:16:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am here now
[10:16:06] <agcolom> Hi Jasper!
[10:16:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I saw your email about icon
[10:16:23] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[10:16:39] <agcolom> yes, do you know why that was removed?
[10:16:45] <agcolom> (from 1-4)
[10:17:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Gabriel created a new page classes
[10:17:38] <uGoMobi> and moved the icon documentation to there
[10:18:25] <uGoMobi> it's under category CSS framework
[10:18:25] <agcolom> ok...
[10:18:31] <agcolom> yes, just found it...
[10:18:49] <agcolom> But the icons do not look like the icons... 
[10:19:04] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[10:19:52] <agcolom> Also, UI has an icon page, and I made ours inline with theirs
[10:20:04] <uGoMobi> and icons can not only be set with classes
[10:20:33] <agcolom> http://api.jqueryui.com/theming/icons/
[10:20:36] <agcolom> yes
[10:21:00] <agcolom> so I'd like to add a page back into the reference... 
[10:21:07] <uGoMobi> agcolom: here I suggested page only about icons https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWN1UAncQHcmDfy9UuD_ftMtyhQhWiq3inYm0ReE-J8/edit
[10:21:46] <agcolom> oh yes, 
[10:22:00] <agcolom> That'd be great
[10:22:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: so it's good to move it from the reference because that should be only overviews of things that are documented elsewhere
[10:22:42] <agcolom> Ok, I can try to make a start either this evening or tomorrow (My family has just gone on holiday ;-) )
[10:22:52] <uGoMobi> great :)
[10:23:19] <agcolom> Now the other thing was about the demo center
[10:23:30] <agcolom> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0-rc.1/dist/demos/pages/
[10:23:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: here are all icons http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/icons/
[10:23:48] <uGoMobi> yeah, what was the issue
[10:24:09] <agcolom> so we're changing data-role="content" ?
[10:24:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[10:24:30] <uGoMobi> just add class ui-content
[10:24:40] <uGoMobi> because that was all we were doing anyway
[10:24:40] <agcolom> so some of the text and demos need to be changed on that page
[10:24:58] <agcolom> e.g. Within the "page" container, any valid HTML markup can be used, but for typical pages in jQuery Mobile, the immediate children of a "page" are divs with data-roles of "header", "content", and "footer".
[10:25:05] <uGoMobi> yes, you are right
[10:25:14] <uGoMobi> good catch
[10:25:20] <agcolom> and then the code examples also
[10:25:27] <uGoMobi> actually, things like that don't belong in the demos
[10:25:35] <uGoMobi> it only belongs in API docs
[10:25:50] <agcolom> the code examples on that page point to alpha 2
[10:25:55] <uGoMobi> having it at two places makes it hard to maintain
[10:26:12] <agcolom> Putting it together: Basic single page template
[10:26:26] <agcolom> there's <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.0-alpha.2/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-alpha.2.min.css" />
[10:26:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I missed that
[10:26:39] <agcolom> :-)
[10:26:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you see first code block
[10:26:53] <uGoMobi> there I changed it [version]
[10:27:03] <agcolom> yes, I saw that. It's good 
[10:27:09] <uGoMobi> so we don't need to change that each release
[10:27:32] <uGoMobi> reminds me that we also have to update getting started article on the learn site
[10:27:42] <uGoMobi> there the code block contains 1.2 links
[10:27:43] <agcolom> yes
[10:27:57] <uGoMobi> we could do something similar there
[10:28:16] <agcolom> regarding the data-role="content", is it costly to keep it?
[10:28:59] <agcolom> (because it's more logical than div role="main" class="ui-content" ?)
[10:29:53] <agcolom> or are we going to also change data-role="header" and footer to role="header" (and footer)?
[10:31:16] <agcolom> (just an idea ;-) )
[10:35:27] <uGoMobi> agcolom: there is no real need to use JS so if we remove all these kind of things it will improve performance
[10:35:40] <agcolom> sure
[10:36:08] <uGoMobi> adding class="ui-content" role="main" in your markup instead of data-role="content" is not more difficult
[10:36:27] <uGoMobi> yes, maybe we can do the same at some point with toolbars
[10:36:39] <agcolom> no I agree, just trying to catch up :-)
[10:37:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: FYI - we did same with field contain
[10:37:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: deprecated data-role="fieldcontain", add class ui-field-contain instead
[10:38:26] <agcolom> ok, cool! Thanks :-)
[10:38:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: another one is buttonMarkup
[10:38:47] <uGoMobi> that's why Gabriel created that classes page in the docs
[10:39:04] <agcolom> ok, I'll check the docs :-)
[10:39:45] <uGoMobi> ok :)
[10:40:51] <agcolom> hopefully I do some catching up next week :-)
[12:44:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We should change our template from <div data-role="content">...</div> to <div class="ui-content" role="main">...</div>
