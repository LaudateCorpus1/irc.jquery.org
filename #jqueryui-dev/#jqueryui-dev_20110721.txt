[07:04:56] <kborchers> jzaefferer: would it make sense for me to add callback options for some of the methods in Menu like next, previous, etc.? I think it would be helpful for users to be able to subscribe to some of those methods and also i think i need them to properly write these unit tests.  thoughts?
[07:05:56] <kborchers> if so, i just add something like next: null in the options and then _trigger("next"); inside of the next method right?
[07:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, ajpiano: can we chat sometime today or tomorrow about widget factory docs?
[09:14:43] <kborchers> jzaefferer: I added some unit tests to that PR but still need tests for scrolling menus and scrolling submenus. Can you look at those tests and let me know if I am doing it right before i add the others?
