[07:00:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: fyi, i have started putting together the new PR with the polymer pointerevent.js. it worked with little effort for mouse events but doesn't seem to want to work on mobile devices (only tested touch so far, not MSPointer). hope to dig in more tonight and have something to send for review soon
[09:17:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: -meeting somehow got muted again
[09:18:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: trying to respond but can't :(
[09:39:32] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: are these the menu tickets?
[09:39:51] <tj_vantoll> Yeah http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9356 & http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9357
[09:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they seem crazy, but I actually want to try to implement the requested behavior.
[09:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's how desktop menus work.
[09:40:44] <scott_gonzalez> And even how <select> works.
[09:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> We already partially fix this in autocomplete.
[09:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> So that means we're going to run into the same things with selectmenu.
[09:41:18] <scott_gonzalez> If we can "fix" it directly in menu, that'd be good.
[09:41:23] <tj_vantoll> Ok that makes sense.
[09:41:24] <scott_gonzalez> But it's going to be crazy.
[09:41:28] <tj_vantoll> Yeah
[09:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> And last time we tried, we couldn't figure out a good solution.
[09:41:43] <tj_vantoll> My main concern was whether it was worth it.
[09:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure kborchers remembers working on it.
[09:41:56] <tj_vantoll> #9357 is non-trivial to recreate.
[09:42:15] <tj_vantoll> 56 I can definitely see happening though.
[09:42:24] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually easier to recreate than you think.
[09:42:25] * kborchers hides
[09:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/autocomplete/default.html
[09:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> Click the input, move your cursor out of the way (down).
[09:43:10] <scott_gonzalez> This is a very common user behavior.
[09:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> Type a, press down a few times, move your mouse.
[09:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> You'll notice that it does what he wants.
[09:44:15] <tj_vantoll> Yeah for autocomplete I can definitely see that. And yeah.
[09:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> But then if you press down a few more times and move the mouse again, it doesn't work.
[09:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's because we hacked in support in autocomplete.
[09:44:46] <scott_gonzalez> But the hack only runs once per render.
[09:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> So this will come into play in a lot of menu uses.
[09:45:27] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I was thinking more of a menubar use case rather than a generic menu usage.
[09:45:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:45:43] <scott_gonzalez> That would be less common.
[09:46:04] <tj_vantoll> Ok, I would agree with marking them both as valid.
[09:46:50] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: maybe we can add this to things to discuss in Portland? i remember we worked on these a lot and never came up with a "good" solution
[09:47:16] <kborchers> always seemed like fixing one thing made something else act weird
[09:47:59] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: sure
[09:49:03] <tj_vantoll> Ok, I'll fix up the tickets later. I'm out for a bit. Thanks.

[11:58:02] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: working on your comments now... is there any reason I can't merge my one branch into other and drop the first PR to avoid any squashing / rebasing ?
[11:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> There's no technical reason.
[11:59:42] <scott_gonzalez> Generally PRs do one thing.
[11:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> But this time it's fine.
[12:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> You need to squash/rebase either way though.
[12:01:15] <scott_gonzalez> You have too many cleanup/fix commits.
[12:03:44] <Dave_Stein> okay
[12:03:58] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez:  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/993#discussion_r4508393 which spacing is off there?
[12:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> $( document ).scrollTop( 0 )
[12:04:15] <Dave_Stein> should i add between ( and el ?
[12:04:22] <Dave_Stein> er the one above it
[12:04:43] <Dave_Stein> github linked you to right comment but gives no space so you dont see what you were commenting :P 
[12:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, sorry, was looking at the one below it.
[12:05:33] <Dave_Stein> yeah github ui is not the best at times
[12:05:34] <Dave_Stein> TestHelpers.draggable.testDrag( el, el, -50, -50, -50, -50, position + " parent" );
[12:05:37] <Dave_Stein> that the right spacing?
[12:05:37] <scott_gonzalez> After (, before and after +, before )
[12:05:40] <Dave_Stein> ok cool
[12:06:34] <Dave_Stein> in my defense, that was there already and i just made them negative rather than postiive numbers ha
[12:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: There's a typo 2 lines above that.
[12:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> Draggalbe
[12:10:35] <Dave_Stein> fixed
[12:46:50] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: okay wrapped it all into pr 993 and squashed to 5 commits... one outstanding issue for me is that weird fixed position "fix"
[12:49:28] <Dave_Stein> also deleted my 3 commits out of my fork of "interactions" so its like I never touched that branch on my fork
[12:56:24] <Dave_Stein> and now to setup an android simulator on windows to do multi touch fun
