[05:21:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ping
[05:35:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: pong!
[05:41:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: morning
[05:41:38] <arschmitz> morning
[05:42:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do all widgets have option defaults now?
[05:42:41] <arschmitz> yes because thats part of the widget factory ( our extension of it ) not the individual widgets
[05:43:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok great
[05:43:11] <arschmitz> so any widget used with mobile even if its not a mobile widget has it
[05:43:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: perfect
[05:44:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in the 1.4 changelog we didn't mention that pageinit is deprecated in favor of pagecreate
[05:44:50] <uGoMobi> was wondering in what section we should add that, and the same for the upgrade guide
[05:44:58] <arschmitz> its not deprecated we just sugest using the other
[05:45:16] <uGoMobi> aha
[05:45:16] <arschmitz> that event is part of the widget factory 
[05:45:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok clear
[05:45:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: then it's still good to add it to the upgrade guide
[05:46:32] <uGoMobi> what exactly is the reason that we suggest the other?
[05:47:21] <arschmitz> timing
[05:47:41] <arschmitz> originally we recomended create
[05:47:50] <arschmitz> then for some timing issue it changed to init
[05:48:04] <arschmitz> but then something john bender did made it so we could go back to create
[05:48:15] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:51:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think I can add it in the "Initialization" section of the upgrade guide and say something like "bind to pagecreate if you want to be sure all widgets on the page are initialized"
[05:51:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what do you think?
[05:51:28] <arschmitz> sure
[05:51:37] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[05:52:05] <uGoMobi> will do that now and then create a PR for the upgrade guide
[05:56:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually im wrong
[05:56:08] <arschmitz> that is deprecated
[05:56:14] <arschmitz> and is something we are doing
[05:57:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/page.js#L52
[05:57:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, then let's add it to the changelog
[05:57:42] <arschmitz> yup
[05:58:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageinit/
[05:58:26] <uGoMobi> we did add a note there
[05:59:09] <arschmitz> cool

[07:00:08] <NiGhTTraX> is there any way I can access a plugin's options dict inside a binded event function?
[07:02:09] <NiGhTTraX> for instance: I wanna read options.items in the change event function of the sortable plugin
[07:05:34] <NiGhTTraX> nevermind, figured it out, get the parent element and use the "option" method on the widget :)
[07:06:25] <uGoMobi> NiGhTTraX: FYI - you can use the #jquery channel for support
[07:06:56] <NiGhTTraX> uGoMobi: thought this was the right place for UI questions
[07:07:39] <uGoMobi> NiGhTTraX: This channel is for the UI and Mobile developers
[07:07:50] <uGoMobi> NiGhTTraX: #jquery is for support for all jQuery projects
[07:08:06] <NiGhTTraX> uGoMobi: ah ok, thanks

[08:55:26] <agcolom_> Thanks :-)
[08:55:48] <agcolom_> I'm happy to work on whatever to improve the docs and examples. I just need someone to take me through the steps to land my PR, delete my local branch and create a new one...

[08:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> Hi James_H
[08:57:54] <James_H> I need to patch in a fix that has been done for jquery ui but not been released yet
[08:58:34] <James_H> once I have patched in to the jquery-ui.js file I have how can i then minimise the file?
[08:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> James_H: Support is in #jquery.
[08:59:53] <James_H> I did ask in there but no one seemed to know/reply and I though devs would be more aware of how to do this?
[09:00:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but this channel isn't for general support.
[09:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> Short answer: You can use http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home, but you won't get any more help in here.
[09:03:48] <James_H> Sorry was not aware.  Thanks for you help.

[10:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:04:20] <agcolom> great. So I've made this PR: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/202
[10:05:34] <agcolom> So I need to land this and also update my local branch... 
[10:05:52] <agcolom> (sorry not my local branch)
[10:05:56] <agcolom> my local repo
[10:06:21] <agcolom> In which order should I do that?
[10:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> What are your remotes named?
[10:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> origin and upstream?
[10:06:52] <agcolom> yes
[10:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> First, get your master branch up to date.
[10:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> `git checkout master`
[10:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> `git pull upstream master`
[10:07:44] <agcolom> done
[10:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> Now rebase your branch
[10:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> `git checkout exampleCleanup`
[10:08:06] <scott_gonzalez> `git rebase master`
[10:08:27] <agcolom> done
[10:08:54] <scott_gonzalez> Now merge your changes into master
[10:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> `git checkout master`
[10:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> `git merge exampleCleanup`
[10:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> You should get a fast forward.
[10:09:41] <agcolom> yes
[10:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> Now push your changes to GitHub.
[10:09:55] <scott_gonzalez> `git push upstream master`
[10:10:24] <agcolom> should be coming up...

[10:12:27] <agcolom> If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D exampleCleanup'.
[10:12:49] <agcolom> so should I go with -D?
[10:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:13:14] <agcolom> Deleted branch exampleCleanup (was 873bb8c).
[10:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder why you get that warning.
[10:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> Now delete your remote branch
[10:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> `git push origin :exampleCleanup`
[10:13:56] <agcolom> why the ':'?
[10:14:07] <agcolom> oh the branch on origin?
[10:14:12] <agcolom> in origin
[10:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> Because you're pushing nothing to remote exampleCleanup branch
[10:14:23] <agcolom> ok
[10:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> The full form is `git push remote-name local-branch-name:remote-branch-name`
[10:14:35] <agcolom> and now create a new branch for new stuff...
[10:14:52] <scott_gonzalez> When you do `git push origin foo` it means `git push origin foo:foo`
[10:15:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but don't make it a hodge podge like this one was.
[10:15:12] <agcolom> oh... ok
[10:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> The PR should be focused on one area.
[10:15:17] <agcolom> it was 
[10:15:28] <scott_gonzalez> Example code is not an area.
[10:15:40] <agcolom> code examples?
[10:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/agcolom/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/379fc0035421b59c7fe88bfa7a24b9cefa45658a and https://github.com/agcolom/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/54953d71c0258593eac07dd41013b53a7611d692 have nothing to do with each other.
[10:16:15] <agcolom> yes, sorry :-(
[10:17:31] <scott_gonzalez> This is interesting: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/graphs/traffic
[10:18:33] <agcolom> my branch merge is not showing?
[10:19:08] <gseguin> agcolom: if you're not an admin on the repo you can't see that url
[10:19:13] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: What do you mean?
[10:19:20] <gseguin> agcolom: this was jquery-ui
[10:19:45] <agcolom> oh, sorry, for me it redirects to https://github.com/
[10:19:51] <agcolom> so I got confused,,, 
[10:20:35] <gseguin> I figured, it took me a couple tries to figure it out too
[10:21:19] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: How many unique visitors?
[10:21:36] * gseguin can't see the data for jquery-ui
