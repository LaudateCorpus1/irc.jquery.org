[05:59:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm deep in my branch atm - was gonna commit this change on master but thought i should check first... it should be listed in the comment right?

[06:02:22] <gnarf> jesus im slow today
[06:02:23] <gnarf> damnit
[06:02:38] <gnarf> removed one console log while adding another
[06:02:40] <gnarf> bah
[06:23:12] <gnarf> hrm
[06:23:20] <gnarf> so - found an issue with simulate
[06:23:27] <gnarf> it doesn't set event.which
[06:30:22] <jzaefferer> gnarf: the issue is on the wiki
[06:30:29] <jzaefferer> gnarf: the timepicker demo is pretty cool
[06:30:41] <jzaefferer> interaction is spot on
[06:30:58] <jzaefferer> would be great to see a 24h variant, as well as variants with just hh:mm
[06:36:08] <gnarf> yup
[06:36:10] <gnarf> coming soon

[06:39:47] <gnarf> should i add that dependency to spinners comment header on master btw?
[06:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I already did it
[06:40:20] <gnarf> ahh

[06:54:12] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/mask] Timepicker: ampm and seconds options - Corey Frang
[06:56:39] <gnarf> jzaefferer: ^^^ other timepickers with 24hr and no seconds
[06:57:46] <jzaefferer> how useful is a timepicker with no intial value?
[06:58:07] <jzaefferer> and the more fun question: can we integrate this with time formats from globalize?
[06:59:40] <jzaefferer> let the user specify the time format to use, then have Globalize.format format 00:00:00, then parse that into the mask to use?
[07:00:53] <jzaefferer> as for the mask issue, I had added that as a todo on the wiki: when tabbing to a field with a partially filled out value, the cursor position is off by one to the left of where it should be, e.g. when entering 35/__/____ on the first test field, tabbing to that field positions the cursor between the two  '3' and the '5'
[07:04:28] <jzaefferer> hey danheberden, I just took a look at the web-view-jquery-org repo, there's nothing in there stopping us from making it public
[07:04:55] <danheberden> jzaefferer yeah, i just felt weird about the httpd being there in the old branch
[07:04:57] <danheberden> but whatevs
[07:07:38] <jzaefferer> uhm
[07:07:45] <jzaefferer> so what is actually live?
[07:07:47] <jzaefferer> the v2 branch?
[07:08:53] <danheberden> yeawh
[07:08:55] <danheberden> *yeah
[07:09:33] <jzaefferer> kborchers: any updates on pr442 or pr419? menu and position stuff...
[07:10:24] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i am working on unit tests for 442. figured i should duplicate all of the event tests for custom item menus. what do you think?
[07:11:23] <jzaefferer> well, that doesn't sound so great
[07:11:42] <jzaefferer> find one or two good tests that test what the items option does
[07:11:57] <jzaefferer> trying to be comprehensive will probably do more damage then its worth
[07:12:19] <kborchers> ok, i can do that. i just started so will get that done asap
[07:12:31] <kborchers> i have not had a chance to look at his changes in 419. would be nice if maybe he merged all of those commits
[07:13:43] <kborchers> not a big deal though. i will try to test it before the meeting
[07:18:13] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[07:24:57] <danheberden> alright jzaefferer - public, cleaned up, and working
[07:25:21] <danheberden> just master now: https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org

[07:29:05] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/mask] Timepicker: _setOption for ampm / seconds - Corey Frang
[07:29:40] <jzaefferer> gnarf: saw my comments about globalize integration?
[07:29:49] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah
[07:29:58] <gnarf> haven't quite investigated yet
[07:31:24] <jzaefferer> I have no idea how many different time format there actually are
[07:31:35] <jzaefferer> maybe the 24h and 12h formats are all we need anyway
[07:34:54] <jzaefferer> looking at globalize, there are a few variations
[07:35:02] <jzaefferer> default is h:mm:ss tt
[07:35:11] <jzaefferer> there are variants without the tt (am/pm)
[07:35:18] <jzaefferer> with hh, H and HH
[07:35:49] <jzaefferer> seems like enough variance to justify using globalize as a source for that

[08:05:51] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/mask] Mask: more fixes for focus positioning / fixing unit tests - Corey Frang
[08:07:09] <gnarf> jzaefferer: I assume "H" or "h" means 4 instead of 04
[08:09:28] <jzaefferer> probably h = 4, hh = 04, HH = 16
[08:10:17] <gnarf> yeah
[08:10:46] <gnarf> i'm not sure that we want to support " 4" but is suppose we could
[08:11:07] <gnarf> also, kinda worried about some of those am/pm options
[08:11:30] <gnarf> not sure how well masked inputs will handle multi-byte characters
[08:11:47] <gnarf> like the jp chars that take two keystrokes to type
[08:32:32] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, 442 is ready for a look again. i tested click, blur and mouseover/mouseleave collapse on the custom item menu. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/442
[08:32:33] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (3w, 4d ago): Menu: Add support for structures other than UL/LI
[08:33:41] <kborchers> there is a test that fails in safari but it failed before i made any changes so i got my stuff in and figured we can look at that after
[08:33:53] <kborchers> the destroy test
[08:38:36] <gnarf> hrm jzaefferer - is there a way for me to access the valid values for AM/PM from globalize?
[08:38:53] <gnarf> i don't seem to see one without digging through cultures
[08:41:58] <jzaefferer> not sure
[08:42:01] <jzaefferer> rworth: any ideas?
[08:44:26] <gnarf> Globalize.findClosestCulture() seems to return the main map object
[08:44:29] <gnarf> i guess i could use that
[08:46:23] <gnarf> also
[08:46:32] <gnarf> im not sure if this would be compatible with an ampm option
[08:47:18] <gnarf> because the ampm is not there in all the globalizses
[08:47:42] <jzaefferer> if you can specify the format using a globalize format, there shouldn't be any options overlapping with that
[08:48:54] <gnarf> yeah, i made my mask almost compat with the globalize string
[08:50:07] <gnarf> need to do mask.replace(/\b(h)(?!h)/i, "_$1" );
[08:50:34] <gnarf> cuz the mask requires the mask in the string to be the same width as the number of characters it accepts
[08:52:17] <jzaefferer> not quite following there
[08:52:45] <gnarf> if you set a mask to "h:mm:ss" it would never allow 2 characters for "h"
[08:53:01] <gnarf> its limited by the width of the mask
[08:53:08] <gnarf> so i made an "_h"
[08:53:26] <gnarf> that accepts " 1"
[08:54:09] <gnarf> still not entirely sure how to hook this in with Globalize - but I'm pretty confident it can be done
[08:54:47] <gnarf> globalize has two format strings right now - "t" and "T" -- the first is sans seconds
[08:55:14] <gnarf> there is no forcing of a 24hr option though
[08:56:09] <jzaefferer> yeah, 24h/12h format depends on the culture
[08:56:15] <gnarf> right
[08:57:17] <gnarf> also - from an app dev standpoint - id prefer my time format to always be in the format my backend expects - not dependent on culture
[08:57:36] <gnarf> but i suppose i just don't include globalize then
[08:57:57] <gnarf> brb
[08:58:00] <jzaefferer> or you make sure the culture is in sync with your server format
[09:01:24] <scott_gonzalez> meeting time
[10:14:26] <gnarf> so out of curisoity
[10:14:34] <gnarf> did anyone look at the code for timepicker yet?
[10:14:54] <gnarf> I'm wondering if what I'm doing to spinner/mask there is blasphemous
[10:15:39] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/mask/ui/jquery.ui.timepicker.js
[10:22:11] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to mask: http://git.io/6PVWvQ
[10:22:11] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/mask] Timepicker: Changing 'pp' to 'tt' to be more compatible with the format used in Globalize - Corey Frang
[10:50:48] <jzaefferer> gnarf: could it make sense for timepicker to extend spinner?
[10:50:58] <jzaefferer> if you need to override spinner methods anyway...
[10:51:09] <gnarf> jzaefferer: maybe - but I don't want all of spinners options exposed either
[10:51:26] <jzaefferer> why not?
[10:51:36] <jzaefferer> hiding them isn't cool either
[10:51:51] <jzaefferer> well, I guess for a good bunch you're right
[10:51:52] <jzaefferer> meh
[10:51:58] <jzaefferer> min/max makes no sense to configure
[10:52:20] <jzaefferer> yeah, that's probably not a good idea
[10:52:40] <gnarf> the only ones that make any sense are step / incremental - perhaps the events
[10:53:06] <gnarf> and since there are multiple "fields"
[10:53:44] <gnarf> i started out extending
[10:53:52] <gnarf> then decided to just blast it away in the instance
[10:54:01] <jzaefferer> yeah, makes sense
[10:54:30] <jzaefferer> in general the approach looks okay
[10:54:52] <jzaefferer> not that much code if you ignore the dependencies :-)
[10:55:29] <gnarf> yeah
[10:55:51] <gnarf> biggest chunk of code in there is the code to convert between an ampm on/off
[10:55:53] <gnarf> :)
[11:14:05] <gnarf> kborchers: couple more comments on that lost commit
[11:14:17] <kborchers> yeah, looking now. thanks
[11:16:38] <gnarf> no ticket for this one i assume?
[11:18:03] <kborchers> gnarf: not that i'm aware of
[11:18:54] <gnarf> also
[11:18:59] <gnarf> rather than $.extend( div.style
[11:19:13] <gnarf> lemme think this through before i say it
[11:19:51] <kborchers> heh, why do that? i like just saying things and then realizing i was totally wrong immediately after saying it ... it's fun ;)
[11:20:31] <gnarf> maybe div.style.cssText = "position: absolute;....";
[11:20:41] <gnarf> save you a function call / looping
[11:22:32] <kborchers> definitely ... will do
[11:23:40] <gnarf> it seems the jQuery offset tests use $.extend
[11:23:46] <gnarf> i wonder if there is a reason
[11:35:07] <gnarf> doesn't seem so
[11:35:20] <gnarf> in fact - i'm going to try to get a commit that does that instead to land in 1.7 :)
[11:35:59] <kborchers> gnarf: hmmm, testing it though, the offset comes back as 0, 0 when testing after using cssText so something is up
[11:36:27] <gnarf> you adding "px" ?
[11:37:12] <kborchers> yeah, just took the extend as is which has the px
[11:50:07] <kborchers> gnarf: i know what i did wrong with cssText ... forgot to pull the ' from around the values
[11:50:10] <kborchers> works fine
[11:50:28] <gnarf> awesome
[11:54:35] <kborchers> gnarf: ok, updated the commit on that PR
[11:55:34] <gnarf> kborchers: did you test it everywhere?
[11:57:24] <kborchers> works in IE9, FF6, Chrome, Safari 5 and Opera 11.51
[11:57:39] <kborchers> i can fire up VM's to test older IE's if you want
[12:04:42] <gnarf> you might want to comment on his old PR pointing to your new one
[12:05:37] <kborchers> i will, working on testing in old IE's
[12:10:32] <kborchers> gnarf: leave it to ie6 to be the headache. a few failing tests. looking into them now
[12:28:55] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] rdworth pushed 1 new commit to grid: http://git.io/tOnQlQ
[12:28:55] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Removed (old) comment saying observable depends on widget factory - Richard D. Worth
[12:44:54] <kborchers> gnarf: so those tests are failing on 1-8-stable in IE6 :/  so i guess no new failures is passing right? all other browsers pass
[12:47:35] <gnarf> kborchers: i guess :)
[12:48:49] <kborchers> i tried tracking down the cause but it wasn't like a one-off thing, some tests expected left: 7 but got left: 42 just all over the place. really weird
[12:52:54] <gnarf> hrm
[12:53:04] <gnarf> random draggable question
[12:56:22] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/RSBcY/
[12:56:43] <gnarf> can you think of any way that i could get the "draggable" to behave like the standard <a> dragging?
[12:56:53] <gnarf> with the cursor?
[12:58:52] <jzaefferer> kborchers, regard PR 460: I lost track of what that actually addresses. Is there something I should test, or can we just land this? Is there something it could break?
[12:58:57] <jzaefferer> *regarding
[13:00:16] <kborchers> jzaefferer: this just addresses some one-off calculations based on rounding that some browsers do and older versions of jQuery that didn't support fractional positions
[13:00:41] <kborchers> shouldn't break anything that i can think of
[13:01:25] <kborchers> unit tests pass except for some that i spotted that don't pass in IE6 ... but they don't pass in 1-8-stable either :/
[13:01:31] <jzaefferer> okay, I'll do a bit of actual testing tomorrow and then land it
[13:01:38] <jzaefferer> okay, good to know
[13:01:45] <jzaefferer> will ignore that /o\
[13:02:27] <kborchers> cool
[13:04:49] <kborchers> there goes the neighborhood
[17:04:55] <rworth> gnarf: do you want to reproduce it entirely, or are you just focused on placing the caret below the cursor?
[18:39:13] <gnarf> rworth: caret below the cursor
[18:39:19] <gnarf> or detecting where caret is
