[05:54:41] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Iâ€™ll tell mikesherove about that.
[05:54:49] <scott_gonzalez> `tell mikesherov I think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/999 is for the draggable regression
[05:54:49] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Iâ€™ll tell mikesherov about that.
[05:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be so much easier to leave a note for someone if autocomplete still worked while they were gone :-P
[06:04:14] <rxaviers> :)
[07:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> Huh, I didn't realize how consistent we were with major release times in the beginning.
[07:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> It was 9 months from first commit to 1.0.
[07:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> 9 months from 1.0 to 1.5.
[07:28:07] <scott_gonzalez> 9 months from 1.5 to 1.7.
[07:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> Then it started to go downhill :-P
[07:43:24] <proudbeard> Hello, does anyone know if it's possible to resize a "resizable div"  from a number input?
[07:45:40] <tj_vantoll> proudbeard Support is in #jquery. This channel is for the development of jQuery UI.
[07:45:51] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez On the bright side 1.10 took 3 months and it's been 4 months since. Hopefully 1.11 won't take 5 more months :)
[07:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> heh, 1.11 definitely won't take 5 more months.
[07:46:31] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9 took 31 months
[07:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> 1.11 has a big focus on docs and download builder though.
[07:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> Half of June is shot between the conf and vacation. But I want to focus exclusively on UI in July.
[07:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> That should get our bug count down and also get us pretty close to 1.11.
[07:49:13] <tj_vantoll> Cool. When are we going to draw the line on exactly what will be in and out of 1.11? I should be able to jump on something if necessary.
[07:51:39] <scott_gonzalez> I think button will get pushed. We haven't even started on it, and that should really be a Mobile-collab project.
[07:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just move that now.
[07:58:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what the status of menubar is, but jzaefferer and I have been reviewing selectmenu and Felix has been very quick to respond.
[08:04:17] <tj_vantoll> For the classes option did we just need to figure out how to deal with those handful of odd scenarios?
[08:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:13:12] <scott_gonzalez> We should discuss that at the conf.
[08:13:30] <tj_vantoll> Sounds good. Is everyone going to be there?
[08:14:01] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: sent you a DM which I know is crazy ;)
[08:14:06] <Dave_Stein> i recall your client doesnt show them as easily
[08:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it shows them the same, but they end up very low in the list because of how many channels I have open.
[08:15:28] <Dave_Stein> gotcha

[13:08:59] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez getting emails... thanks :)
[13:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Your pull requests are stepping on each other.
[13:11:08] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: you mean they are conflicting?
[13:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> You have multiple PRs with the same commits.
[13:11:29] <scott_gonzalez> So your branches aren't independent.
[13:11:52] <Dave_Stein> that was from when i effed up doing my first PR raelizing i should have branched off interactions in my own fork.... let's just close the first PR
[13:12:01] <Dave_Stein> i wont' be making that mistake again
[13:12:04] <Dave_Stein> *won't
[13:12:17] <Dave_Stein> i first thought just making a fork and working on interactions was good enough before we spoke
[14:57:02] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I've started working on menubar myself, since Steven hasn't been seen in a while. I will work on the Jenkins migration Tuesday/Wednesday, hoping to get it mostly running before I fly to Portland on Thursday. Might work on Menubar on the 18hrs of travel...
[14:57:22] <jzaefferer> I've actually got two local commits, but one change still lacks a unit test.
[15:30:13] <eddiemonge> how bad is performance to set a couple of variables on mousemove?
[16:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> eddiemonge: It depends on what else is happening.
[16:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> For example, scrolling and native gestures generally occur on the GPU.
[16:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> Having anything run in JS requires switching to the CPU.
[16:12:13] <eddiemonge> https://gist.github.com/eddiemonge/5702103
[16:12:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I saw.
[16:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> The gist is wrong, but the concept makes sense.
[16:13:03] <eddiemonge> wrong?
[16:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> The conditional is only around part of the focus logic.
[16:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> And you have an object in the prototype, so it's shared across all instances.
[16:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, we've previously decided this wasn't menu's responsibility.
[16:14:56] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm open to reconsidering that.
[16:15:12] <eddiemonge> who's responsibility would it be?
[16:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> Whoever causes the menu to be scrollable.
[16:15:41] <scott_gonzalez> See https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L232-L246
[16:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> Are you using Firefox?
[16:16:22] <eddiemonge> no
[16:16:37] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right, this is an inline menu.
[16:16:44] <scott_gonzalez> So you won't see that behavior showing up.
[16:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> This is actually kind of annoying.
[16:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> The code reads as if Firefox is doing something wrong.
[16:17:07] <scott_gonzalez> But in reality, every other browser is wrong.
[16:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> I asked Jacob Rossi to write this into a spec, but haven't gotten anywhere with that.
[16:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> This is actually correct behavior for the web.
[16:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> But pretty much nobody expects it.
[16:19:02] <eddiemonge> not if you are using a select, which this seems modeled after
[16:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> That's because selects are webby :-P
[16:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> Even Firefox selects show the behavior you want, and those are custom.
[16:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> So that's interesting.
[16:24:24] <eddiemonge> if you combine the two bugs i filed it makes for some weird actual vs expected behavior in terms of keyboard vs mouse
[16:27:32] <scott_gonzalez> We'll dig into this again.
[16:27:45] <scott_gonzalez> We had previously only looked into the case of the menu changing display.
[16:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> i.e., http://dev-test.nemikor.com/behavior/mouseover-when-element-is-shown.html
[16:28:35] <scott_gonzalez> Family just got home. Gotta go.
