[05:43:51] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu Tests: Make the elements without anchors look like group headings and remove disabled elements to focus on dividers and no anchor elements - kborchers
[05:50:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: fyi, i made those changes to menu last night if you want to check them out. also, added units to cover my code added (remain at 96%), added a visual test and verified that categories work in autocomplete again
[05:51:46] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[05:53:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: one thing i did, i just copied an mdash and ndash character into the regex. seems to work in all browsers
[05:53:27] <scott_gonzalez> That should be fine.
[05:53:32] <scott_gonzalez> As long as people use utf-8 :-)
[05:53:38] <kborchers> :)

[06:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Great. I'm working on something else right now, but when I wrap this up, let's make multi-site simpler :-)
[06:16:41] <kborchers> oh come on jq-jenkins! if you would have waited a couple more minutes you would have seen all green.
[07:00:39] <rworth> new api.jqueryui.com repo now on stage.api.jqueryui.com (if you have a cool enough /etc/hosts)
[07:01:36] <rworth> kborchers thanks for your work on the mediawiki2.xml. jzaefferer and I moved the xml content to this repo, I think we're close to done with the jquery-docs repo
[07:01:50] <kborchers> rworth: nice :)
[07:02:13] <rworth> jzaefferer is going to be updating the xmls to have the common stuff missing from the widget factory
[07:02:28] <rworth> then we'll tag/branch 1.8 and starting doing 1.9 docs in master
[07:02:45] <FJ1> @rworth i get a 404
[07:02:48] <kborchers> sweet
[07:03:19] <rworth> FJ1: add 205.186.144.58 stage.api.jqueryui.com to /etc/hosts
[07:03:28] <FJ1> thx
[07:03:37] <rworth> it's not pretty yet, but it's functional
[07:03:54] <rworth> we'll be iterating a bunch over the xml and xsl and html and css over the next week(s)
[07:13:10] <FJ1> can i see the demos (http://stage.jqueryui.com/demos/) already?

[09:58:52] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu: Added a comment about which characters are checked for dividers. - Scott González
[10:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer rworth: So are you guys working on finalizing docs for 1.8?
[10:12:02] <rworth> FJ1: we haven't worked on that site yet. Should come next week and after
[10:12:23] <rworth> scott_gonzalez yeah, jzaefferer is just finishing up getting the common widget stuff in
[10:12:34] <rworth> then we'll tag or branch 1.8 and start hacking 1.9 in master
[10:15:38] <jzaefferer> I'll add irc notifications for the api repo
[10:15:42] <rworth> thanks
[10:15:49] <jzaefferer> common widget stuff is all in
[10:16:45] <jzaefferer> next commit should get posted here

[10:36:12] <jzaefferer> Can we just turn off IE6 on swarm? 212 pending runs...
[10:36:18] <jzaefferer> Krinkle, any idea what's going on there?
[10:36:57] <Krinkle> where?
[10:37:00] <Krinkle> oh that
[10:37:01] <Krinkle> well, it is all blocked on the jquery attributes test
[10:37:02] <Krinkle> new tests shouldn't suffer from it, harmless
[10:37:02] <Krinkle> new tests have priority, so jquery ui should run fine
[10:37:32] <Krinkle> browserstack said they were going to fix it
[10:37:57] <Krinkle> I'll follow up on that right now
[10:38:01] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[10:38:03] <Krinkle> "Re: Crashing IE6"
[10:38:06] <Krinkle> Oh, you're not on that one
[10:38:12] <Krinkle> you were on an earlier branch of that thread
[10:38:16] <Krinkle> I'll re-add you to CC
[10:40:10] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: It isn't messing up other jobs, right?
[10:40:15] <Krinkle> (I don't know for sure)
[10:40:27] <Krinkle> jQuery UI should be able to complete successfully.
[10:40:51] <jzaefferer> Well, this looks bad: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/159
[10:41:00] <jzaefferer> Started more then half an hour ago
[10:42:43] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, the jobs have been really slow for a while now. thus my constant yelling at jq-jenkins
[10:43:06] <Krinkle> hm.. that's odd
[10:43:14] <Krinkle> that may be an unrelated issue though
[10:43:26] <Krinkle> browserstack has been acting weird lately
[10:43:29] <jzaefferer> kborchers: yelling does not help
[10:43:43] <Krinkle> Couldn't put my finger on the issue (haven't tried investigating it further)
[10:43:59] <Krinkle> but I was seeing things like times where 10 browsers are needed and only 1 or 2 (or even none) are in the swarm
[10:44:20] <Krinkle> or times where needed browsers on top of the list were terminated (and not in the log of testswarm-browserstack.run.sh)
[10:44:27] <kborchers> jzaefferer: it makes me feel a little better though
[10:46:55] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: sent
[12:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> I think nacin lied when he said he would be around today :-P
[12:35:02] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: sorry, lots going on, and now I'm headed out.
[12:35:13] <scott_gonzalez> Will you be around on Mondya?
[12:35:25] <nacin> Holiday, so not much. Tuesday, yes.
[12:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> stupid holidays
[12:35:34] <scott_gonzalez> Tuesday it is.
[12:36:10] <nacin> Sorry about that, sir.
[12:36:52] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[13:16:53] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: yt?

[13:52:10] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tests: Added several more property checks to domEqual(). - Scott González
[14:31:11] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #483: STILL FAILING in 31 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/483/
[14:31:11] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Tests: Added several more property checks to domEqual().
[15:26:55] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Looks like IE is having some issue with the new domEqual
[15:27:15] <Krinkle> as usual it thinks differently about attributes/properties
[15:28:12] <Krinkle> Hm.. it might not be that big actually. Looks smaller than I thought
[15:28:54] <Krinkle> that diff is one big blob of noise though.
[15:28:59] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/index.php?action=runresults&run_id=2141&client_id=28153
[15:44:52] <Krinkle> Maybe convert the jQuery objects to arrays before deepEqual so that all of jquery prototype stuff isn't included in the diff
[15:45:01] <Krinkle> what do you think?
[15:45:44] <Krinkle> (that won't solve the IE issue though)
