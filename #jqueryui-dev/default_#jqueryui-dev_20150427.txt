[07:52:57] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12380?
[07:53:10] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we want to add an option to not show tooltips on focus.
[07:54:01] <scott_gonzalez> I really don't understand why people care about this situation so much anyway.
[07:54:20] <scott_gonzalez> So you clicked a link that opened a new window and you're really upset about the fact that you see the tooltip when you come back to the page?
[07:57:39] <jzaefferer> Waiting for the ticket to load
[07:58:51] <jzaefferer> Btw. the argument "native tooltips don't show on focus" is technically correct, but that behaviour is also somewhat broken. When using just the keyboard (no mouse, no screenreader), the content of the title attribute is inaccessible, how is that a good idea?
[07:59:27] <jzaefferer> Has anyone else complained about tooltip-on-focus before?
[08:00:28] <jzaefferer> Ah, ticket finally loaded, so that's his main argument
[08:01:07] <jzaefferer> Afaik some browsers now don't focus links (and/or buttons?) when clicking on them, not sure if that's comparable
[08:04:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: in addition to the above, we actually close a tooltip explicitly on click in one of our demos: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/demos/tooltip/video-player.html#L85-L87
[08:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> I don't recall any complaints about tooltip on focus.
[08:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> Just complaints about this situation where the window loses focus while the anchor has focus, then the user comes back to the window, which re-triggers focus on the link.

[09:17:01] <rxaviers> FWIW, http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12380 is not loading to me.
[09:17:40] <arthurvr> works for me
[09:18:12] <rxaviers> indeed, it opens on Chrome. But, not on Firefox.
[09:18:27] <rxaviers> shoot opening now.
[09:18:28] <rxaviers> :S
[09:37:16] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: hmmm so even if we think his use case is "valid". We have always said we wont support or give options to disable accessibility features. And thats exactly what this would be by reading the aria guide
[09:38:29] <arschmitz> Also if the tooltip is triggered on focus it should only be closed by escape key or losing focus so even adding anything to handle click would be wrong here. 
[09:38:46] <arschmitz> aside from it not working
[09:53:02] <scott_gonzalez> right
