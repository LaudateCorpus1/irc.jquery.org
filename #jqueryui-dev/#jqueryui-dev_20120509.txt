[00:52:09] <jq-jenkins> joern.zaefferer: Menu: Drop contextmenu link from menu demos index, demo doesn't exist
[05:14:46] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: At least when Sublime Text 2 detects indentation wrong, you can tell it to fix it with one command :-)
[05:15:27] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: oh yeah? another ST2 trick i don't know! please tell
[05:16:55] <scott_gonzalez> View -> Indentation
[05:17:09] <scott_gonzalez> You can see what it currently thinks it should be using and you can set it to however many spaces you want.
[05:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> Then click on Convert Indentation to Spaces.
[05:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's in the same menu.
[05:18:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: wow, i guess i should have looked through the menu before manually changing 10 or 15 files from 2 to 4 spaces :/
[05:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[05:27:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: oh, also just noticed in the bottom right corner of ST2 it shows the tab style and file type that has been detected and clicking on either one brings up those View menus (View -> Indentation and View -> Syntax). This program never ceases to amaze me!
[05:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> ohh, that's nice :-)
[05:28:00] <scott_gonzalez> So far my biggest issue with it is the way the sidebar works,.
[05:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> It's like files and folders aren't first class citizens in the editor.
[05:28:37] <scott_gonzalez> Copying/moving is a pain, dragging out of the app is impossible.
[05:29:54] <kborchers> yeah, not a huge fan of the side bar ... i started looking into writing a plugin to show git status in the side bar but didn't get very far. looked possible but just didn't have the time. that would make the sidebar a little more useful

[06:21:42] <scott_gonzalez> I really want to know the size diff from this commit, but compare_size isn't working for me :-( https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/a1b9fbfe7539b9c457357c73f5bddf1484844811

[06:24:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: well, if you do things my way (reference to fixing tabs/spaces) you could just count the bytes by hand for each file then subtract :P
[06:24:27] <scott_gonzalez> :-P

[06:46:27] <kborchers> bot-t: punch jq-jenkins in the face
[06:46:29] <bot-t> kborchers, Couldn't find "punch jq-jenkins in the face" in jQuery Docs.
[06:47:13] <kborchers> you dissapoint me bot-t
[06:47:13] <bot-t> kborchers, Is that a question?
[06:47:18] <kborchers> NO!
[06:48:55] <jzaefferer> kborchers: my default testing enviroment is Chrome stable on OSX
[06:49:00] <jzaefferer> for the menu thingie...
[06:49:22] <jzaefferer> Reload page, hit Tab once, you should see the first menu item get focussed for a split second
[06:49:50] <kborchers> jzaefferer: that is what i am using and don't see what you're seeing. i tab to a menu and the first item remains selected
[06:52:49] <jzaefferer> okay
[06:52:56] <jzaefferer> let me try again in a incoginto window
[06:53:24] <jzaefferer> still happens
[06:53:43] <kborchers> weird
[06:53:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: could you give this a try and see what you get?
[06:55:00] <scott_gonzalez> default menu demo?
[06:55:08] <kborchers> yeah
[06:55:21] <kborchers> default menu test'
[06:55:22] <scott_gonzalez> stays focused
[06:56:18] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ^
[06:56:41] <kborchers> jzaefferer: try on browserstack and see if you still see the issue to rule out your environment?
[07:04:14] <jzaefferer> works fine in Firefox
[08:14:03] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: jqueryui now finished in TestSwarm?
[08:14:06] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: jqueryui now finished in TestSwarm !!
[08:14:13] <Krinkle> all green
[08:14:32] <Krinkle> browserstack is faster now
[08:17:03] <jzaefferer> this will take a while to get back to proper columns: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui
[08:17:07] <jzaefferer> I'm fine with that :-)
[08:17:31] <Krinkle> hehe
[08:17:45] <jzaefferer> last jenkins job still timed out, can we just run a new one to get Jenkins green once?
[08:18:05] <Krinkle> try it
[08:18:26] <Krinkle> if it still times out, I have one more trick - increase stackLimit
[08:18:30] <Krinkle> currently still set to 4
[08:18:50] <Krinkle> all we got from browserstack deployment so far is that 4x1 = 4 instead of 4x1=1 :)
[08:18:54] <Krinkle> which already did a lot
[08:19:11] <Krinkle> they said they increased the overal limit as well, but didn't mention the new limit
[08:19:32] <jzaefferer> started a build
[08:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'll have a node-browserstack release today.
[08:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> Just getting very distracted by other stuff.
[08:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> I've already started it, it'll have support for both API versions.
[08:23:03] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, I didn't think node-browserstack would need many changes for v2
[08:23:25] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, doesn't look like many at all.
[08:23:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm flattening the data they return for the list of browsers though.
[08:23:39] <Krinkle> yeah
[08:23:58] <Krinkle> I find it odd that the /browsers map doesn't match the workers or worker browser object
[08:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> Makes it useful for just passing through to createClient()
[08:24:04] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:24:04] <Krinkle> Exactly
[08:24:06] <Krinkle> Maybe tell them ?
[08:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, I'll send an email about it.
[08:24:24] <Krinkle> from what I understand v2 is not main stream yet
[08:24:34] <Krinkle> so maybe they can fix it still
[08:26:30] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be good.
[08:26:35] <scott_gonzalez> I just sent an email.
[08:40:23] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #402: STILL FAILING in 21 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/402/
[08:40:26] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: aha, the jqueryui test did finish
[08:40:34] <Krinkle> but it is marked failing because of the re-run that was busy
[08:40:42] <Krinkle> during the re-run the test is marked as progress again :P
[08:40:54] <Krinkle> and during the last re-run it timed out
[08:40:59] <Krinkle> getting closer :P
[08:41:12] * Krinkle increases stackLimit randomly from 4 to 8
[08:48:01] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Can you access swarm.jquery.org ? I can't access it..
[08:48:06] <Krinkle> times out
[08:53:02] <gnarf> danheberden: ^^^^
[08:53:28] <gnarf> ooo i got in
[08:54:02] <jzaefferer> worksforme
[08:55:08] <gnarf> i just restarted httpd and jenkins
[08:57:33] <Krinkle> gnarf: yeah.. something went funky
[08:59:30] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I deleted the on-demand build for now, going to trigger another now now that stackLimit=8 is set
[08:59:41] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: okay
[08:59:50] <jzaefferer> We can always fake history :-)
[08:59:55] <Krinkle> hehe
[09:00:10] <Krinkle> I see, you want those old browser to go off page on swarm/user/jqueryui
[09:00:15] <Krinkle> I'll keep the next one :P
[09:00:51] <Krinkle> that ajax console in jenkins is so awesome :D
[09:00:56] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/403/console
[09:01:05] <Krinkle> pretty simple, but just awesome
[09:01:26] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/browserstack woot
[09:01:41] <jzaefferer> It doesn't render my "progressbar"
[09:01:43] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/65
[09:02:05] <jzaefferer> woah
[09:02:34] <jzaefferer> Ha, Safari 5.1 beats Chrome 18
[09:02:42] <Krinkle> yeah, I suppose it was already on
[09:02:59] <Krinkle> It is the last in the last, testswarm-browstack didn't start it now
[09:03:00] <jzaefferer> FF12 takes over FF11
[09:03:36] <jzaefferer> how often is that job page updating?
[09:03:44] <jzaefferer> it seems to go a little crazy right now
[09:04:03] <jzaefferer> getting hundreds of requests within seconds :/
[09:04:34] <jzaefferer> doesn't seem to cope well with lots of browsers running in parallel
[09:06:08] <jzaefferer> also 65kb per request, transferred >2mb in two minutes
[09:06:17] <jzaefferer> that is, after a reload
[09:06:33] <jzaefferer> the html response isn't gzipped
[09:07:06] <jzaefferer> and its always the full page, instead of just the table
[09:13:53] <gnarf> all of those things bother me too
[09:14:09] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #403: STILL FAILING in 14 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/403/
[09:14:45] <gnarf> hrm i just got a "local settings file contains invalid json"
[09:17:21] <Krinkle> gnarf: I made a typo, fixed minutes ago
[09:17:23] <Krinkle> refresh
[09:22:49] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: see #jquery-dev commit
[09:23:18] <Krinkle> gzip and partial snippet are not resolved though

[09:27:47] <jzaefferer> look, scott_gonzalez, finished tooltip!
[09:28:13] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: does Jenkins do simultaneous builds?
[09:28:17] <Krinkle> I hope not
[09:28:37] <jzaefferer> Nope, John Bender set it to a single worker
[09:28:40] <Krinkle> because that would take clients to the latest runs and make the previous one less likely to complete
[09:28:43] <Krinkle> cool
[09:29:28] <jzaefferer> Also sorry scott_gonzalez for missing the meeting. Hans actually missed his meeting at about the same time as well...
[09:29:35] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Major browsers complete within 3 minutes now

[10:17:21] <Krinkle> yeah :P
[10:17:29] <Krinkle> most of it anyway
[10:18:05] <Krinkle> But what can you say about those that discourage plain js, encourage coffee script, and even in js files, recommend avoid semi-colons at all costs

[10:41:03] <jzaefferer> yeah
[10:41:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah to which? or both? :-)
[10:45:08] <jzaefferer> err
[10:45:11] <jzaefferer> with Hans
[10:45:16] <jzaefferer> looking at the ticket now
[10:49:15] <jzaefferer> well, the demos suck
[10:49:20] <jzaefferer> nothing is wrong with tooltip there
[10:49:52] <jzaefferer> forms.html is just messed up, the other one displays images without any text
[10:52:49] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, can you guys work on fixing that stuff?
[12:15:57] <jzaefferer> So our collaboration session ended with me creating that pull request. But yeah, I can work on those two demos
[12:21:11] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez, I'm simplifying the forms demo now, to be more sane

[13:40:52] <jzaefferer> that's stupid, yeah
[13:41:54] <Krinkle> QUnit.push short accept ok() like stuff, so that ok() doesn't have to reproduce QUnit.push internally
[13:41:55] <Krinkle> probably raises() was done like that for convienience
[13:41:55] <Krinkle> I'll keep it like that though, not scope of this thing
