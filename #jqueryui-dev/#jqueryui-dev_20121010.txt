[04:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: I'm not sure how that helps us.
[04:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> Is there something inside that code that we can use for our syntax highlighting?
[05:01:04] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: doesn't look like it … i was hoping there would be some regexes or something but it's just XML
[05:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> Can someone review this? https://gist.github.com/bc23616812dc374312b2
[05:57:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: looks good to me
[05:58:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: just looked though, didn't actually do any testing
[05:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:59:08] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Did you see the menu IE10 ticket?
[05:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> This is crazy. Nested lists by themselves don't have this problem.
[05:59:46] <kborchers> no
[06:00:03] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8647
[06:00:13] <scott_gonzalez> The submenus show the list bullets.
[06:00:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: were we supposed to be testing IE10?
[06:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, very very late in the release.
[06:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> We support it now.
[06:01:01] <kborchers> ok, yeah i never went back through with ie10 once we started supporting
[06:01:14] <scott_gonzalez> So far I've removed everything from core, theme, and menu CSS.
[06:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm down to just this: .ui-menu { list-style:none; width: 200px; }
[06:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> 	.ui-menu .ui-menu { position: absolute; }
[06:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> And the bug is still there.
[06:02:11] <kborchers> :/
[06:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> But without the menu plugin the bug isn't there.
[06:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> So odd.
[06:02:19] <kborchers> o.O
[06:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> Time to start ripping out JS and see what happens...
[06:03:42] <kborchers> heh … well, let me know if you need me to look at it. my mom is in town so may not be able to work until tomorrow night
[06:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I think I'll either end up finding some crazy JS/CSS bug or I'll just email MS about it.
[06:09:34] <kborchers> ok
[06:41:46] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, this is crazy hard to track down.
[06:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm at a point where if I change the CSS rules to use "ul" instead of ".ui-menu" it works.
[06:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> But I still can't reproduce without jQuery UI.
[06:45:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: awesome :(
[06:47:38] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well this is interesting.
[06:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> If I comment out the line that hides submenus on creation, the bug goes away.
[06:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm already simulating that in my reduced test case though.
[06:48:51] <kborchers> still weird
[06:55:27] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, just saw it while browsing for something else.. didnt know if it would help out
[07:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> Down to 70 LOC in menu.js and still seeing the bug...
[07:11:02] <scott_gonzalez> 50...
[07:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> 30...
[07:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> 20...
[07:17:02] <scott_gonzalez> 7 LOC!
[07:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[07:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> It's the JS adding the ui-menu class!
[07:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> That's messed up.
[07:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> And now I have a reduced test case.
[07:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/f532256212ea66ab395e
[07:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ^
[07:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> What a mess.
[07:26:36] <scott_gonzalez> IE has so many bugs related to dynamically adding classes.
[07:31:52] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: so should that show up in a fiddle as well, or are the default styles getting in the way?
[07:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> I would think it would show up in a fiddle.
[07:32:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to publish a page showing the bug.
[07:32:40] <DaveMethvin> ok, I can try it here
[07:32:59] <DaveMethvin> i got some sort of windows update yesterday, i may have had some ie10 fixes
[07:33:13] <DaveMethvin> they still need to fix the pageX/pageY one
[07:34:01] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: http://dev-test.nemikor.com/bugs/ie/list-style.html
[07:35:44] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: http://wnd8.com/grab/043948.png
[07:36:02] <DaveMethvin> that's on my lenovo notebook, i think my tablet hasn't updated so let me check there
[07:38:42] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: yes, the bullet is there on my tablet, so it looks like they fixed this with yesterday's update
[07:38:51] <scott_gonzalez> Awesome, thanks.
[07:38:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll close the ticket.
[07:39:53] <_zoggy_> 'Microsoft is releasing a cumulative update for its Windows 8 operating system today ahead of the general availability on October 26th. The update, around 170MB, includes power and performance improvements, alongside some fixes for audio and video playback in Windows 8 and the usual application and driver compatibility updates.'
[07:39:55] <_zoggy_> that update?
[07:40:07] <DaveMethvin> _zoggy_: most likely
[07:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> I really need to get my tablet updated.
[07:40:20] <_zoggy_> same
[07:40:26] <_zoggy_> im still running the previous preview..
[07:40:35] <_zoggy_> prob expired by now :x
[07:40:54] <_zoggy_> also need to update my hackintosh too
[07:41:04] <DaveMethvin> i think it was suicidal of MS to release IE10 without ever having a recent Windows 7 version, it made things very difficult for the average person to test
[07:41:35] <_zoggy_> doing the whole browser os restriction is just stupid
[07:42:09] <DaveMethvin> _zoggy_: it's a question of which apis are available and how much work it would be to get it running there
[07:42:21] <DaveMethvin> doesn't make a lot of sense to deal with xp now imo
[07:42:51] <DaveMethvin> but windows 7 should have had a lot more previews of ie10
[07:42:53] <_zoggy_> i can understand about the whole direct x being tired to an os.. maybe too much work.. etc
[07:43:18] <_zoggy_> but no way i can go with a browser.. just an app..  cant be ran in some sort of compatability mode.. or disable x features to make it work
[07:43:45] <_zoggy_> unless you wanna use the whole windows rt as your baseline of why they wouldnt do it fo  win7
[07:43:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah but then it's not the same browser ... can't run games, etc
[07:43:59] <_zoggy_> yeah
[07:44:19] <_zoggy_> so i really dont understand why.. unless its just not ready and it will be out for win7 once win8 goes live
[07:44:48] <_zoggy_> but still.. pretty shitty way to beta test.. because im sure there are a crap load of bugs in ie10... that have yet to be discovered
[07:44:53] <DaveMethvin> i'm guessing it's political, don't steal the thunder from windows 8 by releasing ie10 early
[07:45:17] <_zoggy_> personally im curious to see how the windows phone 8 browser pans out
[07:45:58] <_zoggy_> i have a windows phone 7 (running 7.6), and ive not been that impressed with its ability to mimic a desktop browser
[07:50:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: wtf
[07:50:48] <kborchers> oh wait, fixed?
[07:51:08] <scott_gonzalez> heh, yeah
[07:51:58] <kborchers> cool
[07:52:19] <DaveMethvin> i sure hope MS fixes bugs like this after general release
[07:52:24] <DaveMethvin> that would be awesome
[07:52:30] <DaveMethvin> rather than waiting for IE11
[07:53:05] <scott_gonzalez> You'd hope they'd fix regressions in IE10.

[08:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> Microsoft is always so much faster than Google.

[08:51:59] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I will update the tag to check if it work in IE too via browserstack alright?
[08:52:34] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You can test locally without tagging.
[08:52:51] <scott_gonzalez> On the left sidebar in BrowserStack, you can setup a tunnel.
[08:52:54] <rxaviers> via browserstack right, will read how to in the website
[08:52:55] <rxaviers> ok
[08:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> It's super easy. Just type in the URL you use locally :-)
[08:53:16] <scott_gonzalez> It's magic :-P
[08:54:09] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: If that works, we'll deploy.
[08:54:32] <rxaviers> ok
[08:54:48] <rxaviers> I've tested in safari via firebug. and it seemed to work
[08:54:59] <rxaviers> setting manually each one
[08:55:05] <rxaviers> will let you know

[08:57:28] <doesallmagic> rxaviers: Fix location href hash set
[09:21:08] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, fyi the above fix fixed IE and safari \o/
[09:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[09:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> Go ahead and update package.json and tag it.
[09:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> Use whatever the next build number is.
[09:27:26] <rxaviers> on win it worked.. But on mac, Safari stopped hash at the first ampersand &
[09:27:26] <rxaviers> mm
[09:27:50] <rxaviers> checking if I need to escape it too
[09:31:51] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Works fine for me.
[09:33:24] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, great! It seems to be a browserstack bug.
[09:33:48] <rxaviers> Just noticed browser stack trimmed the url when opening on mac. It doesnt happen opening on win though
[09:34:07] <scott_gonzalez> oy
[09:34:11] <rxaviers> Typing the full url on the mac the fix worked
[09:34:12] <rxaviers> will tag
[09:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:34:19] <rxaviers> :)
[09:36:48] <rxaviers> mm
[09:37:26] <rxaviers> the last tag we have is 1.9.0-4. Although, the last one in packages.json is 1.9.0-1
[09:37:41] <scott_gonzalez> Yes.
[09:37:43] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, shall I use 1.9.0-5 or 1.9.0-2
[09:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> We don't need to update jqueryui.com on every release.
[09:37:56] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9.0-5.
[09:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9.0-2 already exists.
[09:38:09] <rxaviers> ok
[09:38:10] <scott_gonzalez> Also, we should never go backward.
[09:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, rxaviers, you mean download builder has the wrong version in package.json?
[09:38:38] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: Can you work through the download issues, then we'll start looking at menubar?
[09:38:52] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, yeap
[09:38:57] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, update package.json to be 1.9.0-5
[09:38:58] <scott_gonzalez> and then tag
[09:39:03] <rxaviers> ok ;) thks
[09:39:26] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, sure. Now, I'm going thru the issues you guys opened in the github. When that's done, I go back to bug list.
[09:39:39] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the trac bug list?
[09:39:43] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:39:46] <jzaefferer> alrighty
[09:39:50] <rxaviers> then to menubar. Does that sound good?
[09:39:59] <jzaefferer> I think Scott is going to kill another component once you're through with that
[09:40:04] <jzaefferer> yep, sounds great
[09:40:06] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Don't forget to update package.json before tagging.
[09:40:42] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I guess we'll keep https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/22 open until we've actually done a code review
[09:41:05] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: where can we make notes for the demo system, and keep ideas like http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8474 ?
[09:41:08] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:41:18] <scott_gonzalez> On the wiki?
[09:41:24] <jzaefferer> THE WIKI??
[09:41:40] <jzaefferer> wiki.jqueryui.com/Demos?
[09:41:40] <scott_gonzalez> At the summit we're going to talk about how to kill the wiki :-)
[09:41:43] <scott_gonzalez> sure

[09:43:56] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, shall I update jqueryui.com packages as well?
[09:44:22] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ok (about issue #22)
[09:44:56] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, maybe that's a good task for the summit. Lot of eyes reviewing that coverage
[09:47:39] <jzaefferer> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/59810840/Demos
[09:48:00] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: we need just for eyeballs and some focus for a proper review
[09:48:07] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: btw. what table are you assigned to?
[09:48:31] <rxaviers> TR and plugins
[09:48:36] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: Scott wrote "We don't need to update http://jqueryui.com/ on every release."
[09:48:50] <jzaefferer> That's plugins site, right?
[09:49:01] <jzaefferer> We should have some flexiblity there
[09:49:09] <rxaviers> I saw, but that download builder update changes static stuff
[09:49:20] <rxaviers> of jqueryui.com
[09:49:42] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what exactly where you referring to?
[09:49:49] <jzaefferer> just that we can fix a few bugs before we deploy?
[09:49:53] <jzaefferer> I gotta go
[09:49:56] <jzaefferer> ttyl
[09:50:02] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, when r u coming?
[09:50:05] <rxaviers> on sun
[09:52:31] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'll update jqueryui.com.
[09:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> Needs npm first.
