[02:28:49] <jquicommit> download.jqueryui.com/debug-ci e3a555e Rafael Xavier de Souza: Debug grunt prepare: check stdin for error message
[02:56:32] <rxaviers> gnarf, scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, RFC: On `grunt prepare`, instead of getting user input, read config file and prepare all jQueryUI versions presented there. The aim is to make it more consistent with what's in the config file.
[03:16:48] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: how is that different from what we're doing right now?
[03:18:43] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, we're passing the jquery-ui version via parameter + DB serves the versions it finds in release/* folder.. The new way will be: `grunt prepare` and DB will check config.json file for what versions it should prepare and serve;
[03:21:22] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: we can pass it, but we don't actually do that in production
[03:21:37] <jzaefferer> its just for local development, but even there we don't really use it: ref || grunt.file.readJSON( "config.json" ).jqueryUi
[03:22:08] <jzaefferer> I pretty much always ran `grunt prepare` without arguments anyway
[03:23:59] <rxaviers> may I interpret that as a +1 for centralizing the input in config?
[03:24:01] <rxaviers> :)

[04:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: As jzaefferer said, you're not supposed to pass anything to `grunt prepare`. I only left that in as an option for local testing against a non-tag.
[04:41:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably fine to remove that, since we can just create a local tag for testing inside DB's jquery-ui checkout.
[04:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> The triage team has killed my inbox and gotten us below 500 tickets :-)
[04:42:59] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, that's the thing. Leaving that as an option kills DB ability to only look at releases/* that are in the config file
[04:43:50] <rxaviers> or we centralize it in the config file, thus allowing DB to alert user when any of the versions have not been prepared and something like that. Or, we keep listing the release/*.
[04:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Removing it is fine, my only concern is being able to test before we tag for real.
[04:45:27] <scott_gonzalez> But we can do that by creating a local tag.
[04:47:06] <rxaviers> That issue is pertinent to either solution, isnt it? (a) passing tag via parameter to `grunt prepare` or (b) reading that version from config file
[04:47:28] <rxaviers> But, yeap, I think local tagging would solve that

[05:50:29] <rxaviers> gnarf, jzaefferer, can you guys gimme a help? I'm in doubt whether or not jenkins has updated a dependency with `npm install`... It seems it did here http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/download.jqueryui.com/29/console
[05:50:42] <rxaviers> But, I've forced an error here http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/download.jqueryui.com/30/console
[05:50:57] <rxaviers> And it still didnt show the message. Locally, it does show.
[05:51:29] <rxaviers> I'd like to double check it built node_modules/grunt/ is the one from my rxaviers branch.
[05:51:36] <rxaviers> s/it/if
[05:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I assume this means "You can close the bug"? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6260
[05:52:49] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: thoughts? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/816#issuecomment-10188435
[05:53:37] <rxaviers> gnarf, jzaefferer, if you guys have access to the files. Could you please run this following command?
[05:53:38] <rxaviers> $ md5sum node_modules/grunt/lib/grunt/log.js
[05:53:38] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8790
[05:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> We should handle a text field in a menu item, but I don't know why you would have a full login form there.
[05:54:40] <scott_gonzalez> Like OS X's Help -> Search menu item.
[05:54:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i saw that. if you look at the help menu in osx ...
[05:54:48] <kborchers> heh
[05:54:59] <rxaviers> gnarf, jzaefferer, if jenkins doesnt clean it, the files should be at /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/download.jqueryui.com/workspace
[05:56:03] <kborchers> but what he's doing is disabling keypresses so that when you're in the text field it doesn't jump down to a menu item matching that letter. i think his login form use case is a little over specific compared to the code he submitted
[05:56:35] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I didn't even look at the PR :-P
[05:56:50] <kborchers> :)
[05:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, why is he using 0/1?
[05:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> I specifically told him boolean.
[05:56:59] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: look at http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/download.jqueryui.com/ws/
[05:57:01] <scott_gonzalez> ANYWAY
[05:57:08] <kborchers> either way i don't like it
[05:57:34] <rxaviers> \o/ great, will check there
[05:57:39] <scott_gonzalez> We could just do something like if event.target === input
[05:57:58] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, aha! grunt has not been updated
[05:58:06] <kborchers> true ‚Ä¶ which i think is what it did in my input menu extension that is completely out of date now
[05:58:09] <kborchers> :)
[05:58:26] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, can we purge that node_modules folder?
[05:59:25] <rxaviers> oh oh
[05:59:27] <rxaviers> nevermind
[05:59:31] <rxaviers> indeed it had
[05:59:56] <rxaviers> in fact*
[06:00:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: heh, inputmenu extension was built before removing all of those stopPropagations so i just have a stopProp on keydown for any input in the menu :P
[06:00:36] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:01:12] <scott_gonzalez> The default case in the keydown switch should just bail if event.target is an input.
[06:01:23] <kborchers> agreed
[06:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> How do you markup the menu item thought?
[06:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> s/thought/though/
[06:03:44] <kborchers> hmmm
[06:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> Closed the PR.
[06:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> There are a lot of things that need to be discussed before even considering a patch.
[06:04:47] <kborchers> which is why i had separate code for inputs because it gets more complex with initialization, click handling, etc.
[06:14:37] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Did my progressbar responses make sense?
[06:16:36] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: looking
[06:17:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yep, makes sense. i think for #1 i was just confused by your example in the ticket where you used negative numbers :P
[06:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> What can I say? I'm an asshole.
[06:18:15] <kborchers> heh
[06:18:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to fix the description.
[06:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> I clearly wasn't thinking about progressbar's actual API when I wrote that.
[06:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> I was in generic problem mode trying to think of Richard's old reasoning.
[06:20:08] <kborchers> no problem
[06:20:14] <scott_gonzalez> fixed
[06:20:17] <kborchers> thanks
[06:20:32] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry :-/
[06:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> That was definitely confusing.

[06:24:43] <jquicommit> api.jqueryui.com/master 3404622 Scott Gonz√°lez: Progressbar: Added max option.
[06:25:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: one thing i did notice is since i'll need to sanitize the value on init and when an option changes, it might be good to have a function (kind of like _value but simpler) to not repeat myself in two places. thoughts or just repeat the check in 2 places?
[06:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> That's fine.
[06:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> I just don't want _value() to be the canonical way to get the current value.
[06:27:10] <kborchers> ok, that's what i figured but since the ticket is "Remove _value()‚Ä¶" just wanted to make sure :)
[06:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, yeah.
[06:27:47] <kborchers> i'll probably rename so that would "remove" it technically :)
[06:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's not going to show up in the changelog anyway.
[06:28:44] <kborchers> cool, i'll look at that a little later. headed out for a bit
[06:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, that'd be an awesome PR, nothing but _value() -> _constrainedValue() and a message "I removed the _value() method" :-P
[06:31:26] <kborchers> lol
[06:33:12] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we can get blue and yellow to cross again: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph
[06:46:56] <scott_gonzalez> I just had a very random thought: Blind developers probably can't listen to music while they work...
[06:53:45] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: done http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph?days=10
[06:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:54:21] <scott_gonzalez> cheater
[06:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> It's only 1 or 2 more tickets to cross.
[06:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> And it's only 10:00a.
[06:54:50] <petersendidit> yea
[06:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess 1:00p according to the graph.
[06:55:23] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe I'll actually get to your PR today, that'd be 1.
[09:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> I guess no testing meeting today.
[09:05:10] <kborchers> testing is for suckers anyway
[09:05:13] <kborchers> :P
[09:05:23] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:05:32] * kborchers is writing tests right now :D
[09:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> Before I add an API that everyone hates, I want to see what people think...
[09:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm adding a flag to _on() for whether or not we should run the disabled check: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L362
[09:15:02] <scott_gonzalez> The flag is optional, but I want to add it to the beginning because easier to see what's going on in calls to ._on()
[09:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> ._on( true, someElem, { long: list, of: handlers } )
[09:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden DaveMethvin gnarf jzaefferer kborchers Krinkle kswedberg mikesherov petersendidit rxaviers timmywil tj_vantoll ^
[09:17:02] <scott_gonzalez> element (the first parameter) is already optional.
[09:17:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: what is the use case for handling events on a disabled widget?
[09:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> This is the change I want to make: https://gist.github.com/13148c06a7b48bb17017
[09:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8758
[09:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8769
[09:18:24] <scott_gonzalez> There are a few other places where we use .bind() directly too because of this.
[09:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: You even do this in menu :-)
[09:19:42] <kborchers> ok, so the use makes sense
[09:19:44] <kborchers> heh
[09:19:45] <danheberden> yeah, it's been a problem and i think this is a good simple solution
[09:19:50] <kborchers> i agree
[09:19:59] <kborchers> i think at the beginning makes sense
[09:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I gotta pick up a friend and take him to the airport, everyone else has until I get back or I'm gonna land this :-P
[09:31:25] <petersendidit> seems fine to me
[09:39:25] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: just about to leave on a plane, but as of 1.8 the core .on() should handle delegated events on everything but the click event, specifically so things like mouseover on a disabled element could give tooltips and the like
[09:39:55] <DaveMethvin> the boolean at the front sure does look ugly :)
[09:40:45] <kborchers> DaveMethvin a.k.a Mr. Rain on the Parade as usual
[09:40:47] <kborchers> :D
[09:41:02] <DaveMethvin> imma make it RAIN up in heah
[09:41:07] <kborchers> lol
[09:41:27] <DaveMethvin> so just tell everyone you only support core 1.8 or higher
[09:41:32] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:41:42] <DaveMethvin> boarding time
[09:42:18] <kborchers> worksforme
[09:42:25] <kborchers> safe travels DaveMethvin
[10:34:45] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Obviously the boolean argument is less than ideal, but I can't think of a better way of handling that.  Not that bad considering it'll rarely need to be set.
[11:28:45] <mikesherov> 63 pending, 487 active, *6* new
[11:30:50] <tj_vantoll> :)
[12:26:21] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i responded on the PR but that should land before the other PR because it will clean things up that are going on over there.

[12:57:17] <gnarf> do you?
[12:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[12:58:08] * gnarf scratches head
[13:00:04] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Is it intended that this.originalPosition, originalPointer, etc needs to be set before firing beforestart because that's messing with my day
[13:00:27] <Dave_Stein> on the other hand, i can leave everything as is, but reset the domPosition stuff on preventDefault of beforestart as well as stop and the bug goes away
[13:01:20] <Dave_Stein> it seems strange a widget can trigger beforestart and cause an exception if several variables weren't set manually within the widget
[13:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Don't we have to store it first?
[13:02:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://cl.ly/image/2u2d2y3B452t
[13:03:17] <gnarf> lemme see if i can repro in ie8 instead
[13:03:19] <gnarf> better debugger
[13:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:04:59] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Well it seems that I need startPosition originalPointer and startOffset to run _preparePosition - which is a pre-requisite for firing beforeStart within draggable itself so an exception there makes sense
[13:05:13] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: It's just strange that it's erroring withi interaction.js first
[13:05:31] <Dave_Stein> but i'm not familiar with interaction.js really I know that was what you were working on gearing up for dealing with more than mice
[13:05:58] <gnarf> trying to set NaN px scott_gonzalez
[13:06:04] <Dave_Stein> if that's the case I'll just add some more comments above the trigger of beforestart to make it clear
[13:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Why is it trying to do that?
[13:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: I'm not sure what error you're getting.
[13:08:08] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: I'm looking some more and I think I sound crazy because Firebug isn't giving me the right stacktrace to where it's actually erroring *sigh*
[13:08:43] <Dave_Stein> in the end I see why those lines you added go above beforeStart so I'll just make sure domPosition gets reset if I preventDefault ... that fixes everything up

[14:57:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: effect issue is a NaN sneaking in - something in there isn't defining an outerWidth - I'm gonna dive in a bit more, but you know how fun debugging is in IE :)
[14:57:52] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[14:57:57] <gnarf> also, most of that code is insane
[14:58:05] <gnarf> so many edge cases

[17:05:15] <_zoggy_> http://jqueryui.com/spinner/#default
[17:05:27] <_zoggy_> click toggle widget, then click set value to 5. nothing happens
[17:05:42] <_zoggy_> Error: cannot call methods on spinner prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'value'
[17:05:42] <_zoggy_> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.js
[17:05:42] <_zoggy_> Line 477
[17:06:01] <_zoggy_> same with get value
[17:48:29] <mikesherov> I need an opinion here on http://jsfiddle.net/Kwq7Y/
[17:48:37] <mikesherov> and http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4345
[17:50:14] <mikesherov> it seems like this is expected behavior
[17:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[17:52:08] <mikesherov> but could also not be‚Ä¶ scott_gonzalez
[17:52:10] <mikesherov> thoguhts
[17:52:11] <mikesherov> ?
[17:52:28] <mikesherov> it's this line: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.sortable.js#L792
[17:53:31] <mikesherov> which currently says if there isn't an inline style or we're forcing the size, set the helper's size to the original's size
[17:53:43] <mikesherov> I can't tell if that makes sense or not!!!
[17:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder why there's an option for that.
[17:57:15] <mikesherov> yeah
[17:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> The docs are oh so helpful: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-forceHelperSize
[17:57:39] <mikesherov> they sorta are though
[17:57:51] <mikesherov> "If true, forces the helper to have a size."
[17:59:23] <mikesherov> petro
[17:59:36] <petro> yo
[17:59:55] <petro> how's life on the island?
[18:00:03] <mikesherov> it's OK
[18:00:38] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like that check should just be against the option.
[18:00:46] <mikesherov> right
[18:00:51] <scott_gonzalez> And clones should force the dimensions to match.
[18:00:52] <petro> hope you get power back soon
[18:00:57] <petro> what's up?
[18:01:21] <mikesherov> oh, nothing, just saying hi
[18:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: What town do you live in?
[18:01:49] <mikesherov> Plainview
[18:01:54] <mikesherov> I'm still no power
[18:01:59] <mikesherov> and probably not until the 13th
[18:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[18:02:21] <petro> wow :(
[18:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> My parents are in Roslyn Heights, they still don't have power either.
[18:02:44] <mikesherov> disgusting
[18:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> Their power line was also ripped down during the storm.
[18:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> So that doesn't help.
[18:03:49] <mikesherov> yeah, power line got ripped down in my neighbor's backyard when a 40 foot tree smashed into their yard
[18:04:13] <scott_gonzalez> They had 7 trees down. CRAZY!
[18:04:20] <mikesherov> Ridiculous
[18:05:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'd say the bug is valid.
[18:05:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why we force the value of helpers.
[18:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> helper: "clone" should force the value, but any other helper should have its size set by the user (unless they set forceHelperSize: true).
[18:06:54] <mikesherov> hmm
[18:07:43] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/91232f6ed53abdc2e2d36929a5129f9a7d8069b9
[18:07:55] <mikesherov> - added forceHelperSize option (default: false), a forced helper size is also triggered when the generated helper doesn't have any styles set for width/height, so this option won't be needed in most cases
[18:08:13] <mikesherov> looks like paul's bug
[18:08:35] <mikesherov> he should be using .width() / .height() instead of .style.width and .style.height
[18:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> Could be, though it's confusing because he used .width()/.height() on the same line.
[18:09:46] <mikesherov> right, which is weird
[18:09:57] <mikesherov> I keep wavering on this one‚Ä¶. ahhh
[18:09:59] <scott_gonzalez> But then again, a lot of what Paul did is weird.
