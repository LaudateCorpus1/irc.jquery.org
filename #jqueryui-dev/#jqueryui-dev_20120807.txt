[06:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commit/a1d0ef654c8a61b6238d04c65fe3ecf550a6f847#L0R187
[06:29:07] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no commit found
[06:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> Is that specifically to copy <code> elements?
[06:29:35] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like we need something generic that copies all HTML.
[06:32:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah. i am no xsl expert but from what i could tell this line https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commit/a1d0ef654c8a61b6238d04c65fe3ecf550a6f847#L0R179 does grab all nodes (all html) but there wasn't a template processing the code elements, they were being dropped. i can try playing with it some more to see if i can get rid of that
[06:32:27] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no commit found
[06:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...ok
[06:36:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: the issue i was having is the <copy> also grabs the wrapping <desc> element, which we don't want. but, by selecting all of the child nodes and applying a template, if you don't have a template that matches the node, it is not transformed and i need to transform the placeholder into the entry-name so i have to process those nodes.
[08:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> Touch Events WG call going on right now...first in like 20 years :-P
[09:11:40] <DaveMethvin> hey scott_gonzalez what was that git command to look up the version given the commit?  something-rev?
[09:13:41] <DaveMethvin> haha, git's command corrector told me
[09:13:43] <DaveMethvin> name-rev
[09:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:16:25] <DaveMethvin> I tried git tag-rev and it suggested name-rev :D
[09:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's so smart!

[13:48:53] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on api.jqueryui.com by Scott González ( ago): Tabs: Don't double define type of event option.
[13:55:45] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: did you test that? that will match every element and return the contents every time apply-templates is called because it matches everything, everywhere. i would not do it that way
[13:56:07] <scott_gonzalez> Would that ever cause a problem?
[13:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> It seemed fine.
[13:57:20] <kborchers> not sure … it's extremely inefficient. i am not an expert either but have written my fair share of xsl. i would not do it that way but obviously there were issues with the way i did it as well so ..
[13:57:53] <scott_gonzalez> I can reduce it to "desc/*".
[13:58:23] <scott_gonzalez> I just don't understand how saying "copy everything, all the time" can even make a difference.
[13:58:39] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't make any sense to me that this template needs to exist.
[13:58:51] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: welcome to XSLT
[13:58:54] <scott_gonzalez> I thought for sure the fix would be in the template that handles desc.
[13:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't find a way to make that work though.
[13:59:22] <kborchers> have you tried reducing to desc/* … i don't think that will work
[13:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> It works.
[13:59:34] <kborchers> hmmm
[13:59:57] <kborchers> interesting … with the code tags still there or just the text?
[14:00:48] <scott_gonzalez> code tags are still there.
[14:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> So are all other tags, which is what I'm trying to fix (anchors were being dropped).
[14:01:12] <kborchers> hmmm, then i guess i would go with that. also ...
[14:01:15] * kborchers finds a new job
[14:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[14:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> XSLT is crazy
[14:02:36] <kborchers> yep
[14:02:57] <kborchers> it's a completely different way of thinking about programming

[14:06:37] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: btw, i was thinking about submitting a PR with all of the images optimized
[14:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[14:06:51] <kborchers> :P
[14:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Feel free to optimize all the demo images.
[14:07:08] <scott_gonzalez> I've asked people to do that before, but nobody has.
[14:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> At least not just the demo images.
[14:07:29] <scott_gonzalez> It always includes the theme images.
[14:07:44] <kborchers> i think there are other items i should probably work on first
[14:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> Like all of jqueryui.com :-P
[14:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, and get 1.10 finished before the end of the month, ok?
[14:11:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to get 1.9 out before then ;-)
[14:12:10] <kborchers> heh
[14:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting really nervous about hitting the end of the month target for 1.9.
[14:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I just did a quick look through the changes to the XSL in api.jquerymobile.com, I don't think it'll be too hard to merge.
[14:14:28] <kborchers> speaking of jqueryui.com … did we not bring on those design guys for stuff like that. seems like a lot of design stuff needs to happen which i am definitely not an expert at
[14:14:38] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to split out any project-specific stuff, like the templates for the demos, but I don't think that'll be an issue.
[14:15:00] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ^^
[14:15:44] <kborchers> i ask because it's more than just tweaks like i've been doing on the api sites … it's a blank slate
[14:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Have you seen the mockups?
[14:17:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, which is why i got scared because they look well beyond my throw a few divs and some css on a page skill level
[14:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[14:18:51] <kborchers> i'm sure i could do it, it would probably just take me 5x as long as those guys
[14:19:08] <rworth> where are we at with the plugins site? Should we have them focus on jqueryui.com next?
[14:20:19] <kborchers> even if they could get some basic scaffolding and some of the more complex design/responsive stuff in, i could take it from there probably
[14:20:23] <scott_gonzalez> I want to reduce the banner on the homepage and we need to implement CSS for the search results page.
[14:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> But I can do that.
[14:20:35] <rworth> ok
[14:20:38] <scott_gonzalez> The plugins site is pretty much ready, just waiting on docs from ajpiano.
[14:20:44] <rworth> great
[14:20:58] <rworth> scott_gonzalez can we set up some load testing with help from gnarf?
[14:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: That'll be kind of hard.
[14:21:36] <rworth> caus it would take lots of actual github repos?
[14:21:40] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[14:21:55] <rworth> hmm
[14:22:26] <rworth> ok, real-world testing it is ;)
[14:22:33] <rworth> At least WordPress is already load-tested
[14:22:44] <rworth> and we're not going to start with 40,000 plugins at launch
[14:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, we'll never have 40k :-P
[14:23:31] <rworth> maybe if you count each version/release
[14:26:07] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Do you know how to move this out to another file? https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L245-259
[14:27:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: pretty sure you can just do similar to https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/preproc-xinclude.xsl#L11-13
[14:27:15] <kborchers> but would have to play with it
[14:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try that. If it doesn't work after 5 hours, I'll just start stabbing myself in the eye.
[14:32:17] <theBrettman> can anyone tell me where ui tree stands development wise?
[14:39:45] <scott_gonzalez> theBrettman: Nowhere. It's not prioritized at all.
[14:40:12] <scott_gonzalez> theBrettman: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[14:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: FML http://cl.ly/image/3k0c052f090M
[14:41:50] <theBrettman> was trying to get around learning yui... ohwell, yui2 treeview it is! ugh
[14:42:21] <scott_gonzalez> theBrettman: There are no jQuery treeview plugins that meet your needs?
[14:43:03] <theBrettman> idk, there's at least two good ones but I will have to study them deeply to even figure that out.
[14:43:50] <theBrettman> but as far as I know, the yui2 treeview is the best made one yet.
[14:44:43] <theBrettman> it's been developed more than any other
[15:09:22] <theBrettman> what do you think about jquery and jquery-ui being more modular kind of like yui3 with it's .use() function?

[15:11:23] <theBrettman> could get rid of some bulk...
[15:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> theBrettman: Are you asking about modularity or dependency management?
[15:11:46] <scott_gonzalez> UI can't be more modular.
[15:12:21] <scott_gonzalez> Every plugin is already in its own "module".
[15:12:36] <theBrettman> modularity. there are a lot of features of a lot of plugins most people won't use
[15:13:45] <theBrettman> or maybe it would be dependency I guess?
[15:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> Are you aware of the API redesigns?
[15:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/03/api-redesigns-the-past-present-and-future/
[15:14:11] <theBrettman> no, been gone for 4 months
[15:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> We've been working on it for almost a year :-P
[15:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> We're trimming down the APIs.
[15:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery is also adding support for modular builds.
[15:19:42] <theBrettman> whew, for a min, I thought I had a big block of dead pixels on my screen. in the comments for that page you linked, there are little ul squares. lol
[15:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, yeah, the CSS is busted on the blog.
[15:24:38] <scott_gonzalez> That'll be fixed "soon" when the new sites launch...
[15:26:12] <theBrettman> I might have to get in on the grid project. is it part of css3 grid layout? browsers are still not close to supporting it :(
[15:27:00] <scott_gonzalez> No, it's a data grid.
[15:27:05] <theBrettman> oh, I guess it's different
[15:27:30] <theBrettman> damn. still have to use bootstrap for grid. :/
[15:28:09] <theBrettman> all I want for christmas is crossbrowser css3 grid layout support :D

[17:41:24] <scott_gonzalez> That's going to make sharing the XSL across projects really easy.
[17:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to work through the big issues with the XSL then move it into grunt-jquery-content and share it with Mobile.
[17:42:59] <kborchers> cool
[17:46:10] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: what other big issues are there? is it just 22 27 and 34?
[17:46:34] <kborchers> or do you have other issues that aren't "issues"
[17:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> Well #22 isn't an XSL issue, it's just a content issue.
[17:48:17] <scott_gonzalez> #27 and #34 are the only remaining issues I know of so far.
[17:48:23] <kborchers> yeah, nvm on 22
[17:48:31] <kborchers> ok, cool
[17:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why position isn't documented the same way that core's position is.
[17:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't we be documenting normal plugins the same way core does?
