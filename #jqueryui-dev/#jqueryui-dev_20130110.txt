[04:56:47] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: No, I was not :-P
[04:57:33] <kborchers> heh
[04:58:51] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: wanted to ask if anyone had tested (or if we're concerned with) dialog and voiceover in FF on OSX? It didn't seem to announce the dialog at all when I was testing last night but I may have just been tired at that point
[05:00:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure we couldn't get it announced in all devices and opted to leave VoiceOver as the odd one out.
[05:00:37] <kborchers> ok
[05:01:17] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, Bryan (whatsock) argues that the most accessible dialog solution today is to not use ARIA at all.
[05:01:51] <scott_gonzalez> So, based on our goals of promoting and improving ARIA, I don't think we're doing much worse in VoiceOver than if we just follow his suggestion.
[05:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> His proposal is to just use aria-hidden on everything else to get the modal functionality.
[05:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> I suspect we'll spend the next 3 years with janky ARIA solutions in UI.

[05:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you want to try updating the grunt-0-4 branch now that the new rcs are out?
[05:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to update our own grunt plugins again.
[05:59:54] <scott_gonzalez> Using the new rcs and replacing grunt.file.expandFiles with:
[05:59:55] <scott_gonzalez> +function expandFiles( files ) {
[05:59:55] <scott_gonzalez> +    return grunt.util._.pluck( grunt.file.expandMapping( files ), "src" );

[06:00:07] <scott_gonzalez> Got me to the point where we were failing on css tasks.

[08:41:23] <autoboxer> Has anyone run into an issue I'm having where jQuery tabs are loading the entire page content into a tab vs. just the content contained in the tabs <div> element
[08:43:01] <kborchers> autoboxer: this channel is for development of jQuery UI ‚Ä¶ you can get support in #jquery
[08:43:13] <autoboxer> my mistake, thank you.
[09:09:26] <Danwe_WMDE> What does jQuery.Widget._trigger() return? The documentation I found doesn't really say and the code is somewhat confusing
[09:09:58] <Danwe_WMDE> Also, why doesn't it simply return the Event object? It kind of sucks that it doesn't use the given Event object but does construct is own one which is then unreachable from the outside.
[09:11:24] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #923: STILL FAILING in 47 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/923/
[09:11:25] <doesallmagic> Scott Gonz√°lez: Update copyright year to 2013.
[09:12:30] <jzaefferer> Danwe_WMDE: _trigger returns whether an event was cancelled, for example autocomplete does this: if ( this._trigger( "search", event ) === false ) {
[09:12:47] <jzaefferer> as in, if false, then don't search
[09:13:03] <jzaefferer> Danwe_WMDE: what's your usecase for accessing the event object?
[09:16:27] <Danwe_WMDE> I want to implement handling for prevent default. But actually, you can still call the event.originalEvent of the event object you pass to _trigger
[09:19:49] <gnarf> Danwe_WMDE: the return of false signifies that default was prevented
[09:22:06] <gnarf> Danwe_WMDE: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L481
[09:22:56] <Danwe_WMDE> gnarf: mh, then I did something wrong, I thought the return value didn't really tell me
[09:23:19] <Danwe_WMDE> event.originalEvent.isDefaultPrevented wroks though
[09:23:30] <Danwe_WMDE> rm no
[09:24:31] <Danwe_WMDE> forget everything. I am working on some generic extension for event handling so I might be a little confused since I am doing stuff differently there
[09:24:57] <Danwe_WMDE> I guess the key to success lays in event.originalEvent for me
[10:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> Danwe_WMDE: It sounds like you're doing something you shouldn't.
[10:07:09] <Danwe_WMDE> I know it does but I didn't really describe it right
[10:07:36] <Danwe_WMDE> I might send it to you some time for feedback

[17:51:44] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: this seems like .text()'s inability to deal with undefined in jQuery 1.6
[17:52:09] <mikesherov> in Opera and IE, we use removeAttr on title of parents
