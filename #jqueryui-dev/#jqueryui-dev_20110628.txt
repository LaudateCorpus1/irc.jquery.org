[04:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: -x adds a reference to the original commit's sha so that we can see where the commit came from
[04:53:01] <scott_gonzalez> don't repush, it's not a big deal and pushing would create a messy history
[06:41:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[06:48:00] <kborchers> ?tell scott_gonzalez you're probably already aware but there is an issue with downloading jQuery UI. The download is interrupted after a few seconds.
[06:48:01] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[08:09:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cool (on the -x)
[08:09:45] <bot-t> (69 hours 2 mins ago) <djQuery> tell gnarf hey you got a link to that gist that was doing the same as livequery?
[08:15:29] <gnarf> btw - Thanks RewardJS - Grooveshark is awesome
[08:16:00] <kborchers> gnarf: yes it is!
[08:17:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you around?
[08:17:58] <scott_gonzalez> sort of
[08:17:59] <bot-t> (1 hour 29 mins ago) <kborchers> tell scott_gonzalez you're probably already aware but there is an issue with downloading jQuery UI. The download is interrupted after a few seconds.
[08:18:23] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: yup, we know, for some reason it's sending the download builder HTML page instead of the actual zip
[08:18:30] <scott_gonzalez> we haven't been able to figure out what's going on
[08:20:39] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hrm
[08:20:53] <gnarf> who's looked into it?
[08:23:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, thanks. a number of people were complaining about it earlier in #jquery
[08:24:33] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: people on infrastructure?
[08:24:50] <gnarf> danheberden: ?
[08:30:48] <gnarf> hrm
[08:31:19] <scott_gonzalez> looks like JD just fixed it
[08:33:13] <gnarf> coo
[08:33:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: why does "onSelect" seem wrong??
[08:33:40] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/335/files
[08:33:46] <gnarf> shouldn't that be "select" ?
[08:33:51] <gnarf> or is it the old crappy api?
[08:33:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: fyi, you got one \o/ in #jquery for the fixed UI download ... but it was because people would stop asking about it. ;)
[08:36:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: because datepicker does things its own way :-P
[08:36:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: k
[08:36:26] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: both of those pulls got units added
[08:36:46] <gnarf> i'm gonna test and pull then i guess
[08:37:42] <danheberden> gnarf jd got it squared away
[08:38:01] <danheberden> i was thinking it must the the main boxes creating the problem, but the proxy server was full of logs :/
