[05:38:27] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Did you see that styling form controls is going around the whatwg mailing lists again? (http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2013-December/041691.html)
[05:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Ugh, I've been ignoring it because of the "(Was: Re: Forms-related feedback)"
[05:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> Forms-related feedback had been going on forever.
[05:41:24] <tj_vantoll> Yeah that thread branched off a bit.
[05:42:23] <tj_vantoll> It's an interesting read. I'm debating whether I want to chime in, although I don't have a good solution to offer. I can only more evidence that this is a big problem.
[05:42:36] <tj_vantoll> only *offer* more evidence
[05:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I agree with Jonas' comments.
[05:43:07] <tj_vantoll> http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/6qadQ/ This "works" in Chrome stable now.
[05:43:37] <tj_vantoll> You can swap out the UI with shadow DOM but you give up all <input> functionality.
[05:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> Damn, I hope my auto-update isn't broken AGAIN.
[05:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still on 30.
[05:44:19] <tj_vantoll> 31 is stable.
[05:44:25] <tj_vantoll> :(
[05:44:38] <scott_gonzalez> I constantly have to manually download Chrome. It's ridiculous.
[05:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> I love the new diff view for prose documents.
[05:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> I wasn't expecting the increased font size.
[05:47:50] <tj_vantoll> That's a nice touch.
[05:48:31] <tj_vantoll> I had heard about them but I hadn't seen one yet. Very nice.
[05:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I was looking at https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/445/files
[05:49:16] <scott_gonzalez> And now I just filed an issue to add this to pretty-diff: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/pretty-diff/issues/9

[11:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: "
[11:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> The gist of the argument was that we should let UAs decide how they want to
[11:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> design controls and avoid limiting their options by standardizing behavior
[11:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> of pseudo-elements."
[11:25:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'd honestly be surprised if a good solution were to ever come into existence.
[11:30:05] <tj_vantoll> Yeah
[11:31:13] <MarchHare> maybe somebody can help me, I've got a website I'm using jquery and I've got a anomaly got the tabs and username and password fields on the top, and the username and password fields mirror on the bottom of the page and I don't see any extra <div> tags :< 
[11:32:21] <tj_vantoll> MarchHare: Support is in #jquery. This channel is for the development of jQuery UI/Mobile.
[11:32:35] <MarchHare> oops thanx :)
[11:33:20] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I don't see there ever being a solution either. So my point was that it should be easy as possible to build the more powerful controls without reinventing the wheel.
