[08:49:00] <IvanKuzev> hello guys.i want to talk about the spinner with somebody.
[09:17:03] <gnarf> IvanKuzev: whats on your mind?
[09:20:44] <IvanKuzev> well i thought that i can do some work on something thats on focus
[09:21:46] <IvanKuzev> so i was going to ask who is working curently on it and where to see the //todo list(if there is any beside the wiki)
[09:39:24] <gnarf> planning wikis, spinner is scott_gonzalez's project
[09:39:30] <gnarf> for the most part
[09:39:36] <gnarf> and i believe its pretty much done
[09:39:51] <scott_gonzalez> yes, any open todos are on the wiki
[09:40:24] <scott_gonzalez> the big open issue is BigNumber support
[09:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> which we can actually ship without
[09:40:43] <gnarf> if you're looking for something to work on, scott_gonzalez / jzaefferer / rworth are the guys to talk to
[09:41:09] <IvanKuzev> well i tried saying hello to scott....
[09:41:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: we gotta do something about our pull requests soon :)
[09:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> sorry, I don't pay attention to IRC unless I'm mentioned
[09:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> didn't see your PM
[09:42:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: as long as i have you here
[09:42:33] <gnarf> is there any reason we shouldn't merge these split effects in? replace "explode" with "split"'s explode?
[09:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> IvanKuzev: https://raw.github.com/gist/343f808c781fddcdf159/b70cf9b138247f53babdfcfb0b8839bad8a79b9b/gistfile1.txt
[09:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I thought there was still some API uncertainty
[09:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> or was that just for text effects?
[09:44:13] <gnarf> that was text effects
[09:44:18] <gnarf> i think split is pretty stable
[09:44:38] <gnarf> at least stable enough to land - perhaps we should do one quick review of the "options"
[09:44:39] <gnarf> but
[09:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> have you done extensive testing of them cross browser?
[09:52:34] <gnarf> i had - ages ago, ill will set something up again
[09:59:38] <IvanKuzev> ouh...its a lot to learn how a plugin works.maybe i will try it after agood night sleep.but which shoud i chose
[10:23:05] <IvanKuzev> gnarf: what are those aria-* attributes the plugins add  to the element?
[10:28:42] <scott_gonzalez> IvanKuzev: ARIA is an accessibility layer
[10:29:25] <scott_gonzalez> it exposes accessibility information that the DOM either doesn't contain natively
[10:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> which the browser then interprets and exposes to the OS accessibility layer
[10:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> which is then exposed to assistive technologies, like screen readers
[10:30:36] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria
[10:31:28] <IvanKuzev> ...ok think i get it.
[10:32:11] <IvanKuzev> not sure how to implement it with a plugin  but i get the idea what it is
[14:29:33] <atrigent> anyone have any comments about this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/544 ? :)
[14:29:34] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by atrigent (1d, 2h ago): A small iframeFix refinement
[14:31:14] <gnarf> atrigent: draggable is in the middle of a rewrite - perhaps put a note about that same issue in the planning wiki
[14:31:31] <gnarf> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137878/Draggable
[14:31:52] <atrigent> gnarf: so that the same change will be made in the rewrite?
[14:32:28] <atrigent> also I think iframeFix is being done in the mouse functionality in the rewrite?
[14:32:36] <atrigent> the shared mouse functionality
[14:32:53] <gnarf> atrigent: it probably wont be the "same change" but we will surely make sure that bug isn't present if we can - the way that whole code chunk works will probably be very different
[14:34:05] <atrigent> right
[16:18:57] <aalbino> anybody here?
