[05:53:13] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: TestSwarm gets stuck on ajax test, Running: ajax: jQuery.ajax() - script, Remote with POST, across all browsers: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/523966
[05:53:32] <jzaefferer> otherwise there's just one failure in the css module: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/854
[05:54:18] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer Has ajax ever worked since the new server? I think that may be a ngnix config issue
[06:04:07] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: I don't know, I didn't know it has been an issue since the move.
[06:04:41] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer i'm not sure either, all i know is I have been testing locally the past two months
[06:04:43] <DaveMethvin> :D
[06:04:56] <DaveMethvin> if I rerun that test here it succeeds
[06:05:05] <jzaefferer> This fails: http://builds.jenkins.jquery.com/jquery/c33108cad16ba6ff831d5cbc45b9dfbf12650e0e/test/index.html?module=ajax
[06:05:25] <jzaefferer> that is, gets stuck at the same position
[06:05:31] <jzaefferer> or not?
[06:05:41] <jzaefferer> looks like it timed out instead
[06:05:54] <jzaefferer> but there's tons of 404s logged
[06:06:16] <jzaefferer> I'm not sure how many of those are on purpose
[06:06:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah a lot of those are expected
[06:06:30] <DaveMethvin> testing 404
[06:06:56] <jzaefferer> what the hell is "404 World"
[06:06:57] <jzaefferer> ?
[06:07:27] <DaveMethvin> it's a post to a non-existent page
[06:07:37] <DaveMethvin> two params, 404 and World
[06:08:15] <DaveMethvin> hmm, i'm getting several errors locally, let me rebuild
[06:10:01] <DaveMethvin> oh that's why, my master was not up to date
[06:10:41] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: going back a little, when you notice issues like that, please ping me about them or log an issue on jquery-infrastructure
[06:11:25] <DaveMethvin> sorry, i thought you guys knew about it so I didn't want to be a pest 
[06:11:42] <jzaefferer> if nothing happens for a few days, assume the worst ;)
[06:12:08] <jzaefferer> with the new server most things are running pretty well by now
[06:12:16] <jzaefferer> still not really reliable, but getting close
[06:15:20] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: so no local issues anymore? Any idea what exactly goes wrong on TestSwarm? It looks like its executing PHP just fine, so probably just a specific issues for one specific request?
[06:20:22] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer i'm having an unrelated build issue now, something on my system has a file open
[06:20:27] <DaveMethvin> so i have to track that down
[06:25:20] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer finally got it all to build, and yes ajax runs locally without errors
[06:28:11] <jzaefferer> I guess after several timeouts handled by QUnit, TestSwarm kills the run as timed-out, even though it might continue running
[06:28:26] <jzaefferer> but as long as we can see failures here, it'll also fail when run by TestSwarm: http://builds.jenkins.jquery.com/jquery/c33108cad16ba6ff831d5cbc45b9dfbf12650e0e/test/index.html?module=ajax
[06:29:03] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: I don't know what's going on e.g. here: http://builds.jenkins.jquery.com/jquery/c33108cad16ba6ff831d5cbc45b9dfbf12650e0e/test/index.html?module=ajax&testNumber=490
[06:29:29] <jzaefferer> ah, actually, there's a 502 Bad Gateway error
[06:29:38] <DaveMethvin> that one works for me 
[06:29:49] <jzaefferer> so nginx won't allow POST requests? Is that it?
[06:30:07] <DaveMethvin> right, it thinks a POST to an html page is crazy :)
[06:30:12] <jzaefferer> yeah...
[06:30:24] <jzaefferer> its not?
[06:30:37] <DaveMethvin> we just need to test the client side of the request for those
[06:30:48] <jzaefferer> can you request on of the php files instead?
[06:30:57] <DaveMethvin> not sure why we don't
[06:32:49] <jzaefferer> doing a post on echoQuery.php works fine
[06:35:02] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer there are a few like "jQuery.ajax() - script, Remote with POST" that would be tricky to do that way
[06:35:32] <DaveMethvin> we could create a php program that retrieved the content from another file
[06:35:53] <DaveMethvin> although having that on a public url would be a big security hole
[06:36:07] <DaveMethvin> it would need to only accept specific requests
[06:36:28] <DaveMethvin> "PHP get me data/test.js"
[06:37:46] <DaveMethvin> this looks fixable on our side though, i agree
[06:38:48] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: I don't really understand what's going on there, but it seems sane for nginx to reject post requests to html files
[06:39:09] <jzaefferer> someone running nginx locally (like me) would have that same problem, I suppose
[06:39:19] <DaveMethvin> we just want to have it return the html content regardless of get/post
[06:39:23] <DaveMethvin> yes
[06:39:27] <jzaefferer> though I don't have the php extension installed, it wouldn't work here anyway
[06:40:06] <jzaefferer> okay, can you look at fixing that, and let me know if there's something that you can't resolve on your end?
[06:40:17] <DaveMethvin> yep
[06:40:29] <jzaefferer> all green is the goal, once its there you can actually yell at people if they make it red ;)
[06:40:55] <jzaefferer> we can also have Jenkins email people when they break the build
