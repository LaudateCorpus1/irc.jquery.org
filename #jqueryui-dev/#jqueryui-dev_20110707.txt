[06:34:34] <__ch_ri_s> hello, i've found a bug on jqueryui.com.. where can i report it?
[06:36:15] <__ch_ri_s> hm guess it's not the right time lol
[06:39:11] <denete> __ch_ri_s: you could open a bug ticket
[06:39:33] <__ch_ri_s> denete, that would make the bug public
[06:40:08] <__ch_ri_s> don't know if you think posting a XSS-vulnerability online is a good idea, but i don't think it is lol :p
[06:41:55] <denete> maybe you could e-mail Richard
[06:47:08] <__ch_ri_s> #jqueryui
[06:47:12] <__ch_ri_s> crap
[06:57:21] <__ch_ri_s> kborchers you got 2 secs for me?
[06:57:33] <kborchers> sure, what's up?
[06:58:00] <__ch_ri_s> well, i can't post a xss vuln on the jqueryui.com site on twitter, so should i just try to DM him or something?
[06:58:21] <__ch_ri_s> not so formiliar with twitter lol
[06:58:31] <kborchers> yeah, if you DM that is private
[06:58:33] <__ch_ri_s> use it every once in a while but not much..
[06:58:41] <__ch_ri_s> allright!
[06:59:46] <__ch_ri_s> thanks =)
[06:59:54] <kborchers> np
[07:05:54] <ThiefMaster|work> why is modifying dialog buttons (e.g. disabling them) so messy? :/
[07:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> __ch_ri_s: email me: scott.gonzalez@gmail.com
[07:11:31] <__ch_ri_s> scott_gonzalez coming right up
[07:12:00] <scott_gonzalez> ThiefMaster|work: how are you doing it? you can modify buttons as if they're not in the dialog $( "#btn1" ).attr( "disabled", "disabled" )
[07:12:40] <ThiefMaster|work> hm how would i give them an ID when creating them through the buttons setting of the dialog?
[07:15:31] <ThiefMaster|work> ah nvm, reading the docs helps ;o
[07:18:19] <__ch_ri_s> scott_gonzalez, mail sent :)
[07:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[07:33:48] <ThiefMaster|work> hm.. are mouseenter events ignored on disabled buttons?
[07:34:07] <ThiefMaster|work> i tried binding such an event to display a tooltip why the button is disabled but it didn't fire
[07:41:57] <kborchers> ThiefMaster|work: yes, it is disabled. you should get support in #jquery though
[07:43:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: thought you might want to see this http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7538. Might be something to check during 1.6.1 support testing
[07:54:01] <ThiefMaster|work> like always, nobody replying in there ;x
[08:02:11] <__ch_ri_s> scott_gonzalez, need to go. Hope to hear from you/others about the bug! greetings from the netherlands :)
