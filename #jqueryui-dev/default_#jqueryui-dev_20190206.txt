[08:16:02] <liju> hi
[08:16:19] <liju> i am getting a problem in positioning the tooltip
[08:17:19] <liju> the div ui-helper-hidden-accessible is filled with data as many times you hover the link
[08:19:21] <liju> I just used only the class .ui-tooltip { position: absolute;color: #000;padding: 12px;border-radius: 25px; max-width:400px;background-color:orange;z-index:99;}
[08:19:45] <liju> i haven't given a reference to jquery.ui.css
[09:20:55] <liju> is this forum active
