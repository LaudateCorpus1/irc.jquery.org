[03:08:57] <Imaginativeone> how do manage my tab-widget headers with a text variable?
[03:09:45] <Omar-> Imaginativeone #jquery is for help. this channel for dev discussion
[03:10:49] <Imaginativeone> sorry...
[07:24:37] <jzaefferer> dekajp: we can discuss the slider stuff here
[08:09:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez arschmitz - https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+user%3Ajquery+sort%3Aupdated-asc first few pages is mostly ui/mobile now - any chance you could sort through and at least bump the pr with a comment (sadly line comments don't count) to sort it to the bottom of my scan list?  hopefully close one or two along the way?
[08:11:27] <arschmitz> gnarf: most of the mobile ones are still active and valid and cant land probably for at least another month
[08:11:40] <arschmitz> all those ones on the second page are waiting for a pr to land in ui
[08:12:20] <gnarf> arschmitz:  can you comment on the pr saying its not forgotten, but blocked waiting for ....
[08:12:31] <arschmitz> sure
[08:12:40] <gnarf> also maybe ask for rebases where needed etc
[08:12:45] <gnarf> just to sort them to the bottom of that list again
[08:12:51] <gnarf> can't close things that are still open :)
[08:13:02] <arschmitz> Sure 
[08:16:12] <gnarf> i kinda feel anything "last updated > 2 months" is getting "scary" :)
[08:16:37] <arschmitz> gnarf: this is work based on a PR in ui over 2 years old
[08:17:01] <arschmitz> This is all just on going work for ui 1.12 and mobile 1.5
[08:17:16] <arschmitz> The mobile ones that is 
[08:19:35] <gnarf> hard to distinguish between "forgotten" and "still waiting" sometimes, and also forcing the bump 
[08:19:53] <gnarf> especially for an outsider (like me) looking in
[08:23:07] <arschmitz> Yeah i just commented on all of them

[10:10:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[10:11:04] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or rather Pong! :)
[10:12:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i dont remember what that was about any more
[10:12:10] <arschmitz> but you have lots of updated pr's
[10:12:11] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: NP.
[10:12:17] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7537 and I'm noticing that the change causes the modal to now be created unconditionally - not only when the panel is dismissible.
[10:12:21] <sfrisk> Now that MC Frontalot song is stuck in my head, thanks guys.
[10:12:50] <gabriel_schulhof> sfrisk: How fotunate then that I'm unaware of it :)
[10:13:11] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I guess that should be OK, since most panels are dismissible, right?
[10:13:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats not good we need to fix that
[10:13:18] <arschmitz> no 
[10:13:27] <arschmitz> we should only create a modal if its actually used
[10:14:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ... OK ... then this needs to be done differently. We need to call _createModal() from _setOptions() if no modal has been created.
[10:15:46] <sfrisk> gabriel_schulhof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKt8Ct6oBmE
[10:16:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: At this point, I'm inclined to treat the PR as a bug, because I have to change the implementation quite significantly. The only thing that can be retained is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7537/files#diff-6d15a611c0df883200a38818496539a6R96, and I don't think that's worth keeping the OP's commit around.
[10:16:49] <arschmitz> Yeah im fine with that close the PR open a bug reference it 
[10:16:56] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.

[10:21:28] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #7884: Panel: Implement on-the-fly support for option "dismissible" 02http://git.io/oiyBXA
[10:31:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: If the panel is not dismissible, check which of the following should be allowed to close it: [ ] 1. Clicking the close link [ ] 2. Swiping it off the screen. [ ] 3. Pressing escape. [âœ“] 4. (IMO) User navigates away from the page.
[10:32:27] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and, of course, [âœ“] 5. .panel( "close" )
[10:33:03] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but what about the first three? I'm not sure ...
[10:34:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: For popup, escape, and clicking outside the popup will not close it. However, in case of the popup, I don't think we have any special data-rel="close" anchor handling.
[10:34:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, I think that means the above checkbox should stay empty for swipe and for escape, but I'm still not sure about the close link.
[10:35:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I mean, if the dev provides a close link, that should close the panel even if it's dismissible, right? I mean, otherwise, why didn't they hide the close link?
[10:35:25] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean even if it's not dismissible.
[10:58:48] <arschmitz> yes
[10:58:59] <arschmitz> a close link should always close i think
