[04:07:50] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Ping!
[04:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> gabriel_schulhof: pong
[04:30:39] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Hey!
[04:30:59] <gabriel_schulhof> I got grunt-wordpress to work with a vanilla Wordpress site.
[04:31:43] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: It wasn't entirely clear from grunt-wordpress's README.md that I have to install the wordpress plugin as well, only from the error message generated by running grunt wordpress-deploy
[04:32:18] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: The examples illustrating how to loosen the upload mime type restriction filter were useful.
[04:32:37] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: ... though I'm not sure where such code should go. I added it to grunt-wordpress.php, but that seems hacky.
[04:33:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Now I have to figure out how not to make it look like a vanilla wordpress site.
[04:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah, I had WordPress developers in mind :-P
[04:33:18] <scott_gonzalez> I can update the README to be more explicit about it.
[04:33:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess it's not like it's intended for a wide audience, so ... well, up to you.
[04:34:34] <scott_gonzalez> We just use plugins for things like upload settings.
[04:35:52] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Can you add an include into grunt-wordpress.php so that if I put a specially-named .php file in the same directory it will read that $mimes thing from there? ... or is that not the right, clean, solution?
[04:35:58] <scott_gonzalez> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-wordpress#getting-started says that you need to install the PHP file as a plugin.
[04:36:18] <scott_gonzalez> That's not right. It's completely unrelated to grunt-wordpress.
[04:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> And writing WordPress plugins is super simple.
[04:36:44] <scott_gonzalez> Especially if you use mu-plugins.
[04:37:02] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Oh, right. There it is. Maybe you should do two separate subheadings - one for grunt, and one for wordpress, for skimmers like me :)
[04:37:40] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I'll make it a plugin.
[04:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> I can update it since the first few sentences are from grunt init and I hate them.
[04:38:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Awesome!
[04:42:29] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, I split it off into a plugin.
[04:46:41] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Is it a lot of work to replace the ?p=12 with, like, /widgetname?
[04:47:03] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: I guess that's part of the rewriting done in jquery-wp-content, right?
[04:47:14] <scott_gonzalez> That's in the WordPress config.
[04:47:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK. I'll look for it.
[04:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> Settings -> Permalinks
[04:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> You probably just want to choose the "Post name" option.
[04:48:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, wow! That's great!
[04:48:22] <gabriel_schulhof> That was easy. Just need to document the step.

[09:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui/compare/scottgonzalez:datepicker-rebase-cleanup...calendar-simple
[09:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to go through and clean up the history a bit.
[09:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> It got quite messy during the transition.
[09:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> But it's rebased :-)
[09:04:03] <fnagel> Ahh cool
[09:04:31] <fnagel> so we will have a dateoicker and a calendar-simple branch?
[09:05:04] <fnagel> Did you find out what messed up the PR?
[09:05:35] <fnagel> And should I merge or rebase wirth master from now on?
[09:06:18] <fnagel> We should talk about the selectmenu bug tickets soon
[09:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> We'll end up with just the datepicker branch.
[09:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> Right now the datepicker branch on the jquery repo is still in the old state.
[09:07:02] <scott_gonzalez> I have a datepicker-rebase-cleanup branch on the scottgonzalez fork which is rebased and has curated history
[09:07:03] <fnagel> old state = with merge commits, right?
[09:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> In the same state as you left it.
[09:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> The calendar-simple branch is your datepicker branch rebased on top of my datepicker-rebase-cleanup branch.
[09:07:52] <fnagel> ahem, tj and joern tried to rebase it without success before so...
[09:08:11] <scott_gonzalez> I called it calendar-simple because it was my attempt at a simple rebase, and it surprisingly worked.
[09:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it wasn't easy ;-)
[09:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> Rebasing datepicker took a while. I had to manually resolve dozens of conflicts
[09:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> But it was worth the effort.
[09:09:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be working on cleaning up the history on calendar-simple today.
[09:09:55] <scott_gonzalez> Once I know that's working, I'll force push datepicker-rebase-cleanup to the datepicker branch and then we can start a new PR for review of the calendar split.
[09:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> And that PR will have a much easier history to work with.
[09:13:03] <fnagel> Sounds good, just ping when you are ready so I can start work on the datepicker branch again
[09:14:15] <fnagel> When this is done I use rebase to update from master, correct? Just to make sure
[09:15:17] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> Though rebasing can be tricky depending on what happens in master.
[09:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> Like file renames.
[09:15:47] <gseguin> aloha
[09:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> But that type of thing shouldn't happen again before this is merged.
[09:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully...
[09:17:16] <fnagel> hehe, we will see :-)
[09:18:37] <fnagel> Ok, I need to leave. Can we talk about the selectmenu tickets on friday or saturday?
