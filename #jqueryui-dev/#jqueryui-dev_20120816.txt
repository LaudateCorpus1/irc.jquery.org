[05:32:56] <bot-t> (4 hours 35 mins ago) <agcolom> tell scott_gonzalez Hi, I just noticed that in ui the code example in the overview doesn't have the code highlighting. (http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/accordion/) Is this deliberate?
[05:38:32] <agcolom> Hi Scott!
[05:40:22] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I think it's because the code is in CDATA and not in <pre><code>
[05:43:00] <scott_gonzalez> It's not the CDATA, it's because there's no <code> tag.
[05:43:55] <scott_gonzalez> Though the CDATA is unneccessary in that case.
[05:45:44] <agcolom> ok
[05:47:11] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: To fully answer your question though: It's not intended to skip the syntax highlighting, but it is somewhat intentional right now.
[05:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> If anything other than full examples have syntax highlghting, it will break the iframes for the full examples.
[05:47:59] <scott_gonzalez> That's just a bug that needs to be fixed.
[05:48:14] <scott_gonzalez> But you'll notice that all of the demos work for UI, but some are broken for Mobile.
[05:48:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's because Mobile has syntax highlighting on other code blocks.
[05:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> You shouldn't change it, we do want the highlighting on all of the code blocks.
[05:49:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: yes, I've used <pre><code> everywhere....
[05:49:10] <scott_gonzalez> I just wanted to make sure that all of our examples were actually working in UI when I was going through them.
[05:49:23] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Yeah, <pre><code> everywhere is correct.
[05:49:32] <scott_gonzalez> It just causes a bug in web-base-template to show up.
[05:49:44] <scott_gonzalez> Which I have on my list of things to fix :-)
[05:49:45] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: sure, no problem... It's just that I haden't noticed it before, I was wondering...
[05:50:03] <agcolom> ah, ok....
[05:50:13] <scott_gonzalez> Well, now if you notice that the iframes at the bottom of the page have content, but no functionality, you know why.
[05:50:59] <agcolom> so is the iframe in the final example picking up the full code of the example?
[05:51:29] <agcolom> (that's great if this is the case...)
[05:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's picking up the full code of the <pre><code> block, but it's finding the wrong block.
[05:52:00] <agcolom> is it only looking in the <example> tag?
[05:52:10] <scott_gonzalez> The XSL generates something along the lines of: <pre><code>...</code></pre><div class="example"></div>
[05:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> And the script that generates the iframes is looking for the example divs, creating iframes inside them and populating them with the content of the associated code block.
[05:52:54] <agcolom> brilliant!
[05:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> But the problem is that it doesn't just look at the previous sibling, it searches for the code blocks, and assumes that they will match up 1:1.
[05:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> So the first code block on the page gets put into the first iframe.
[05:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> Which is wrong if there are any other code blocks on the page.
[05:54:13] <scott_gonzalez> It's matching them up by index, which is really naive but works on the existing api.jquery.com.
[05:55:27] <agcolom> ah, yes, that's not what we want :(
[05:55:54] <agcolom> so we need to restrict that to the example block?
[05:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I'm thinking, I've just been waiting to see if I can think of any cases where we would want live demos outside of the examples section.
[05:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I'll move this to the top of my list and fix it this morning.
[05:58:14] <agcolom> brilliant! Thx! Btw, I've got some answers for the event types just now, so I'll be able to get that done very soon....
[05:58:30] <agcolom> Have a lovely day...
[06:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, you too.
[06:48:37] <kborchers> jzaefferer: wondering if you saw this https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/commit/ab7583033f9bf9a11d5d095fd5893b64cad92a1b#commitcomment-1721869
[06:51:18] <jzaefferer> kborchers: yeah, should revert that. Worked for me as I included the dir property in my config.json
[06:51:33] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can we move the dist/wordpress default for the dir property to grunt-wordpress?
[06:51:51] <jzaefferer> we shouldn't bother every single project with that...?
[06:52:09] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, also i have a simple download page but i'm not sure how to add the link to the nav at the top of the page
[06:52:34] <jzaefferer> kborchers: nav is defined in web-base-template
[06:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I probably wouldn't have chosen "dist/wordpress" as a default.
[06:53:41] <kborchers> ok, i'll get that in and push so you can take a look
[06:53:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is there a better default we could switch to?
[06:54:14] <kborchers> jzaefferer: does pushing to master update qunitjs.com live or does a deploy have to be manually run. i just don't want to push something live before you see it
[06:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: dist? site?
[06:55:28] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know if there's a default that makes sense.
[06:55:30] <jzaefferer> kborchers: afaik there's no automatic deploy, so far I've been deploying stage and live for qunit manually
[06:55:40] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, cool
[06:55:52] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: dist seems fine, the wordpress subfolder isn't useful
[06:56:33] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Why did this come up?
[06:56:47] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/commit/ab7583033f9bf9a11d5d095fd5893b64cad92a1b#commitcomment-1721869
[06:57:02] <jzaefferer> I've got a dir prop in my config.json, Kris doesn't
[06:57:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You broke it.
[06:57:20] <scott_gonzalez> You shouldn't deifne the dir in the config.
[06:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> That was written that way for a reason.
[06:57:31] <scott_gonzalez> The directory is not configurable per user.
[06:57:48] <jzaefferer> Yeah, I got that. Just wondering if we could take it a step further and move it further up...
[06:58:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm really not seeing the issue.
[06:58:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm assuming you want to remove the dir from all projects.
[06:58:40] <scott_gonzalez> That actually creates work, which I assume is the opposite of your goal?
[07:00:51] <jzaefferer> nevermind
[07:02:52] <kborchers> jzaefferer: take a look at https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/commit/61eb42f25217b854f4a44fc26f726235a375e065 and let me know what you think. i haven't pushed the change to web-base-template yet but will do so shortly. until then you can view it at /download
[07:03:05] <kborchers> like i said, it's very simple right now
[07:04:43] <jzaefferer> kborchers: do you have credentials to deploy to stage?
[07:05:05] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i think i do somewhere. i'd have to find it
[07:05:26] <jzaefferer> something like that you could just deploy to stage for others to review
[07:05:37] <jzaefferer> though in this case pulling it down and deploying locally took me all of five seconds :-)
[07:05:49] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, that makes sense
[07:05:58] <kborchers> i just pushed the web-base-template change too
[07:06:04] <jzaefferer> doesn't look great, but a lot better than nothing
[07:06:23] <kborchers> yeah, it needs work but just wanted to get a start and get feedback
[07:06:29] <jzaefferer> for web-base-template you'd have to also cherry-pick the commit into the legacy branch
[07:06:50] <jzaefferer> how about moving the Download link next to Home?
[07:06:58] <kborchers> jzaefferer: to make it live you mean?
[07:07:11] <kborchers> yeah, we can move that. probably makes sense
[07:07:21] <jzaefferer> yeah, then would still need to pull the change down on the right server
[07:07:30] <jzaefferer> at least that's what I've been doing...
[07:07:41] <jzaefferer> one of these days it'll all be automated...
[07:08:14] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, well i'm not going to pull into the legacy branch until we're happy with it. i'll just deploy to staging for further revisions until we like it
[07:09:08] <jzaefferer> okay, cool
[07:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg kborchers: I've got an XSL question.
[07:19:07] * kborchers hides
[07:19:25] <scott_gonzalez> <xsl:apply-templates select="foo"> will invoke the template with the node itself as the context.
[07:19:47] <scott_gonzalez> Does <xsl:call-template name="foo"> do the same thing?
[07:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> Or does the template not get a context and you have to pass parameters?
[07:21:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: if i'm understanding your question, no. i believe #1 uses the foo node as the context, #2 uses the current node being processed in the calling template as the context … i think
[07:21:37] <kborchers> wait
[07:22:35] <kborchers> yeah, i think that's right
[07:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, from MSDN: "Unlike <xsl:apply-templates>, <xsl:call-template> does not change the current node or the current node-list."
[07:23:24] <kborchers> i would have to play with it to make sure though … i think you can also specify a match attr on the named template but not sure if that pulls the match out of the context or only works if it is the context
[07:23:50] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so i think MSDN is agreeing with me, right?
[07:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:24:08] <kborchers> \o/
[07:24:10] <kborchers> :)
[07:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> That's annoying. I want to call a template and just have it work on the current element.
[07:25:27] <scott_gonzalez> Wait, so if I just do something like <xsl:for-each select="foo"><xsl:call-template name="bar"/></xsl:foreach> it should invoke it in the correct context right?
[07:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> Because the context will already be the foo element?
[07:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try this.
[07:26:22] <kborchers> i think that should work
[07:26:44] <kborchers> i usually try to avoid loops but since this isn't a real time transformation it's not that important
[07:31:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: any reason you don't use apply-templates on that though?
[07:32:46] <scott_gonzalez> Because I have no idea what's going on in all of this :-P
[07:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> Also, call-template is actually sane to follow.
[07:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> While apply-templates is not.
[07:33:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you should be able to just do <xsl:apply-templates select="foo"/>
[07:33:54] <kborchers> and then have a <xsl:template match="foo">
[07:34:02] <scott_gonzalez> But it's really hard to follow the logic of what is happening when you read the XSL.
[07:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's like reading code this code:
[07:34:33] * scott_gonzalez function foo() {
[07:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> doThing1();
[07:34:47] <scott_gonzalez> doThing2();
[07:34:49] <scott_gonzalez> doThing3();
[07:34:50] <scott_gonzalez> }
[07:34:52] <scott_gonzalez> vs:
[07:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> function foo() {
[07:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> runFunctions();
[07:35:08] <scott_gonzalez> runFunctions();
[07:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> runFunctions();
[07:35:13] <scott_gonzalez> }
[07:36:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: but what you forgot is it would be runFunctions("foo") and inside runFunctions is a switch on that string
[07:36:34] <ben_alman> is there any place jquery throws an error internally because of retarded user input to a function that's not going to be fixed?
[07:36:44] <ben_alman> i'm trying to illustrate how to use a function call stack
[07:36:55] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: $( ".." ) ?
[07:37:38] <ben_alman> wow, that's a great one
[07:37:40] <ben_alman> thanks!
[07:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Well, it's the difference between calling a function and triggering an event.
[07:38:36] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i guess i have just written a lof of XSL and it just makes sense somehow :/
[07:39:01] <scott_gonzalez> I guess.
[07:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> It just seems really hard to reason about what's happening with apply-templates.
[07:39:36] <kborchers> i spent 2 years where that was most of what i did … i am still trying to forget that
[07:39:55] <scott_gonzalez> It makes refactoring really hard.
[07:40:24] <scott_gonzalez> And the smaller the templates are, the harder it is to reasona bout.
[07:40:44] <kborchers> i can agree with that
[07:42:33] <kswedberg> kborchers: don't forget it yet! We still need your help on the api docs madness. :)
[07:42:55] <kborchers> :)
[07:43:37] <kborchers> kswedberg: i'll retain the XSL knowledge, i just want to forget the 2 years wasted of my life :D
[07:43:39] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: I'm currently trying to get core and UI in sync with regards to the XSL.
[07:43:50] <kswedberg> ok! good to know, kborchers
[07:43:58] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: nice!
[07:44:22] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: have you (or has anyone else) figured out how to do the example demos yet?
[07:44:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, if you do a local deploy of api.jqueryui.com, you'll see working demos.
[07:44:57] <kswedberg> at one point we were going to pull out those examples into separate files.
[07:45:11] <kswedberg> ok, cool. will do that when day job cools down.
[07:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> We're doing what the current site does.
[07:45:34] <scott_gonzalez> We're parsing the page for the code blocks then generating iframes in JS.
[07:46:35] <kswedberg> oh wow. ok. definitely much less work in the short term.
[07:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like something is causing it to not work on the new core site, but we can figure that out.
[07:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see what's happening on the core site.
[07:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually going to be fixing that issue today, so the core site might start working :-)
[07:49:07] <kswedberg> awesome!
[07:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> This doesn't make sense, does it? https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries2html-base.xsl#L254-258
[07:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> The <xsl:choose> should be dropped, right?
[07:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> Just always do 259
[07:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> In which case, we can just inline the attribue in the <div> on 256?
[07:55:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i agree with all of those statements
[07:56:22] <kborchers> meaning, it doesn't make sense, the choose can be dropped and inline the classes :)
[07:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:57:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: or anyone else. any recommendations on generating documentation for JS?
[07:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> Awesome, now I'm making progress on reducing the size of the XSL :D
[07:57:53] <kborchers> :)
[08:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Do you know if there's a reason that core uses <argument> and <parameter>?
[08:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> Are they used in different scenarios or is it just an inconsistency?
[08:29:16] <scott_gonzalez> Searching for "<parameter" in api.jquery.com shows only a handful of uses.
[08:29:28] <scott_gonzalez> All inside animation methods, for the step callback.

[08:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Would you mind just throwing a sample of one of the docs into a gist?
[08:42:00] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, nevermind.
[08:42:09] <scott_gonzalez> That's a silly request. I should just look at the commit :-P
[08:45:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, cool. So you're just hiding the line numbers in the code examples and letting everything else fall through to default styling?
[08:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> That should be good for now.
[08:45:27] <scott_gonzalez> At some point we can actually style the page, but I think that's probably pretty low priority.
[08:46:09] <jzaefferer> yeah, the line number looked crappy when not aligned to the code
[08:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I'm sure.
[09:20:09] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, just got back. If you still need it, just let me know. Yeap, jzaefferer idea of hidding gutter :)

[10:05:12] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: sorry, was afk
[10:06:37] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: pretty sure <parameter> is only used inside <option>
[10:15:52] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Is that something we want to continue, or should we normalize to <argument>?
[10:17:43] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I dunno. can't remember why we did it that way, but I think rworth had an opinion about it. pretty sure there was a sample xml template in the jquery-docs repo that had it that way
[10:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ?
[10:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Next question: Why do we use type="Options" when it just gets converted to PlainObject anyway?
[10:20:53] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: same answer as before.
[10:21:27] <scott_gonzalez> heh, ok
[10:21:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, he removed both in the UI repo.
[10:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm guessing he thought we'd just normalize.
[10:21:52] <kswedberg> then let's do the same in core. :)
[10:21:53] <scott_gonzalez> Would be good to get confirmation from him though.
[10:21:58] <kswedberg> sure
[10:25:58] <scott_gonzalez> In the interest of making progress on this right now, I'm going to normalize to <argument> and PlainObject in the api.jquery.com repo and then update the XSL accordingly.
[10:26:16] <kswedberg> cool
[10:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> If rworth cames back with an expected response, we can just rever the commit and do the opposite in the UI repo.
[10:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> s/expected/unexpected/
[10:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> s/rever/revert/
[10:35:38] <scott_gonzalez> hmm... kswedberg: http://stage.api.jquery.com/Types/#Options
[10:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> Oh: http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Options
[10:37:00] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: That would mean that this isn't working, right? https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L129
[10:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> It would also mean that it shouldn't even exist.
[10:40:04] <kswedberg> that appears to be the case
[10:40:14] <kswedberg> should we just ditch Options altogether then?
[10:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> I think we should.
[10:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't seem very valuable to have an extra type.
[10:40:43] <kswedberg> let's do it. I guess we can leave it on the live site for now, but for the new one, kill it.
[10:40:45] <kswedberg> right.
[10:40:53] <kswedberg> the distinction is too weasily
[10:40:54] <scott_gonzalez> That description doesn't seem to me like it's providing any useful information beyond marking it as PlainObject.
[10:41:00] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll drop it.
[10:41:18] <kswedberg> k. want me to do that? or are you in there doing that now?
[10:42:41] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez ↑ ?
[10:43:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to do it right now.
[10:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> Since it affects the XSL, which is what I'm working on.
[10:44:00] <kswedberg> k. thx, scott_gonzalez
[10:54:05] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Boolean references #Options
[10:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> That's the only reference though, seems odd.
[10:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> Should I just drop that section?
[11:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Joining the call?
[11:03:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you on the call?
[11:03:35] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'm trying to join via sip and it's not working :/
[11:04:10] <kswedberg> sorry
[11:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm on. I called in.
[11:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> I've never used SIP.
[11:04:30] <kborchers> i always have and it worked
[11:04:54] <gnarf> oh doh
[11:04:54] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez I need to find the phone # again.
[11:04:59] <gnarf> that call..
[11:05:05] <kswedberg> brt
[11:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Check Skype :-)
[11:06:24] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Can you call in?
[11:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[11:07:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i'm in. i just don't like the speaker phone on my cell and i don't have long distance on my land line
[11:16:10] <gnarf> sorry to run - day job meeting starting up :)
[11:48:47] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Just committed the Options -> PlainObject and <parameter> -> <argument> changes.
[11:48:55] <kswedberg> awesome!
[11:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> I also updated grunt-jquery-content, so deploys should be faster now.
[11:49:39] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to `npm update` not just `npm install` to get that change though.
[11:50:48] <kswedberg> ok
[13:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg kborchers: Are you allowed to use variables for the name of a template?
[13:27:45] <scott_gonzalez> The equivalent of: $tmpl = $type + "-name"; <xsl:call-template name="$tmpl">
[13:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like it should work. I guess I can just try it :-P
[13:28:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not sure see ?tias
[13:28:38] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Try It And See
[13:28:41] <kborchers> :P
[13:28:49] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:30:28] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I just PMed you.
[14:00:33] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I wanna say no?, and that's why we're having to do two passes? (perhaps)
[14:01:24] <rworth> at least, this seems to bring to mind a challenge I had at the time, doing reusable content, and ended up doing two passes. Maybe it was something else
[14:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: You're thinking of preproc-xinclude.xsl?
[14:35:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it seems to be mad about the variable.
[14:36:10] <scott_gonzalez> That's unfortunate.
[14:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> "The value '{$tmpl}' of the attribute 'name' is not a valid QName."
[14:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHA: You can hack around it: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1236038
[14:46:41] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Are we not documeting plugins on the new api.jquery.com?
[14:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> For example, jQuery.tmpl()
[14:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Do you know? ^
[14:58:15] <DaveMethvin> we can dump that stuff somewhere else don't you think?
[14:58:24] <DaveMethvin> i mean, they've been abandoned for a while
[14:58:24] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good to me.
[14:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> I don't want them on api.jquery.com.
[14:58:51] <DaveMethvin> we need t a new domain, gtfo.jquery.com
[14:58:52] <scott_gonzalez> I just want to make sure I can delete code related to them in the XSL.
[14:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:59:01] <DaveMethvin> do it
[14:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> gtfo.jquery.com/quirksmode
[15:11:43] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/WrA49Q
[15:11:43] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Simplified example template. - Scott González
[15:11:43] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Adjusted type rendering. - Scott González
[15:29:15] <scott_gonzalez> The mock up for the API site looks so much nicer than what we currently have implemented.
[16:25:32] <rworth> scott_gonzalez yeah, definately plugins are not makin the switch to the new api.jquery.com
[16:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: call?
[16:26:55] <rworth> scott_gonzalez ready
