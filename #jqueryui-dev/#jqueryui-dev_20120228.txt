[04:17:47] <jzaefferer> rworth scott_gonzalez: looks like selectmenu's usage of the simulate plugin causes some odd errors in Safari: http://bassistance.de/i/1bf4ee.png
[04:17:56] <jzaefferer> any idea what might be going on there?
[04:19:37] <jzaefferer> looks like Safari doesn't like our defineProperty hack
[05:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'll keep looking into the simulate bug, but as a temporary workaround, you can do .simulate( event, { clientX: 1, clientY: 1 } )

[10:22:12] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by fnagel (4m, 2w ago): Selectmenu: Code review
[10:35:31] <kborchers> jzaefferer: you around?
[10:37:36] <kborchers> ?tell jzaefferer saw your comments on the menu docs. hope to get that squared away tonight. other than the todo's for menu on the wiki, any thoughts on where i should focus next for 1.9?
[10:37:36] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[10:37:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[10:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Want to document the uses of $.browser?
[10:39:59] <kborchers> "None" -- done
[10:40:02] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[10:40:19] <scott_gonzalez> Would be good to have a list in http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3773
[10:40:25] <kborchers> you mean find everywhere we use it how and make a list?
[10:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:40:29] <kborchers> gotcha
[10:40:34] <kborchers> i can do that, sure
[10:40:40] <scott_gonzalez> And if you're feeling ambitious try to remove some.
[10:40:55] <kborchers> ok, sounds good
[10:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously don't try to remove things in the interactions since they're being rewritten.
[10:41:16] <kborchers> right
[10:41:20] <scott_gonzalez> But it'd be good to document where we're using it and why.
[10:41:30] <kborchers> yep
[10:41:40] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: btw, we need to make some plans. you still available sunday evening?
[10:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> We'll likely need to work around the same stuff, so knowing what kind of support tests or workaround we'll need will be good.
[10:41:59] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG, that's coming up already, huh?
[10:42:05] <kborchers> yep
[10:42:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm still around. I'll double check with Kristin when she gets home.
[10:42:41] <scott_gonzalez> There's still nothing on my calendar other than "Kris in town"
[10:43:04] <kborchers> i get in around 6 i think so after checking in to hotel, etc. probably available around 7ish
[10:45:27] <kborchers> just ping me after you talk to Kristin and we'll set something up. never been to that area so i know nothing about bars, restaurants, etc. also, up for what ever dinner, drinks.
[10:45:47] <kborchers> i'll probably need to eat at some point since my flight leaves at 1, through cleveland and gets in at 6
[10:46:56] <scott_gonzalez> We can grab dinner when you get in.
[10:49:08] <kborchers> cool, just let me know when and where and I'll be there.
[10:49:45] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: fyi, i'm staying here. don't know where that is in relationship to you, restaurants, etc. http://goo.gl/26OuV
[10:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> You're staying across the street from the mall.
[10:51:08] <scott_gonzalez> That's 3 miles from my house :-)
[10:51:13] <kborchers> nice!
[10:51:21] <tbranyen> done
[10:51:24] <tbranyen> 4 channels!
[10:51:34] <rworth> hazaa
[10:52:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i just assigned that ticket to me so i remember to take care of it
[10:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[10:52:44] <tbranyen> rworth: i'll spend some time reading up on all the proposed ideas
[10:52:47] <kborchers> it says create a new ticket for each instance ... just do a list and ignore that?
[10:52:52] <tbranyen> and give the current rewrite a read through
[10:53:04] <tbranyen> i am disconcerted of no unit tests tho
[10:53:09] <rworth> tbranyen: cool. The visual demos should serve as makeshift tests for now
[10:53:20] <rworth> patches welcome :)
[10:53:36] <rworth> actually the draggable unit tests could be a decent starting point
[10:53:39] <tbranyen> ok cool lemme see if i can get those going
[10:53:41] <tbranyen> sick
[10:53:43] <rworth> they use simulate
[10:53:56] <tbranyen> yeah i noticed that, is it some custom jquery ui harness thing?
[10:54:04] <rworth> in fact, they're one of the reasons we developed simulate, to enable automated testing of mouse and keyboard events
[10:54:18] <rworth> it's a utility for simulating native browser events
[10:55:00] <rworth> of course it will have to be updated for touch as well, and that will be... fun
[10:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> tbranyen: The reason there are no tests is because the API is in flux.
[10:55:53] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Yeah, just list out the places + reasons in that ticket.
[10:56:04] <kborchers> ok, will do
[10:56:08] <tbranyen> scott_gonzalez: that makes sense
[10:56:50] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hoping to get this damn freelance project out of the way that was supposed to be done weeks ago then i can focus on 1.9 stuff at night
[10:57:31] <kborchers> been doing both recently and i think both suffer
[10:58:15] <scott_gonzalez> What? You can't work on three projects at once and do perfect work?!? :-P
[10:59:02] <kborchers> yeah, new job during the day, and two at night has been a little crazy
[11:04:40] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: just fyi a quick search for $.browser finds 33 matches across 11 files
[14:26:56] <johnbender> johnbender: as requested!
[14:26:59] <johnbender> arg
[14:27:01] <johnbender> talking to myself again
[14:27:06] <johnbender> jzaefferer: as requested!
[21:48:14] <kborchers> ?tell jzaefferer how/when are browsers added to swarm? Opera 11.6 needs to be added. I'm seeing weird failures with datepicker
[21:48:14] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
