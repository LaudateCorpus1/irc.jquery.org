[05:17:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf rworth: http://api.jqueryui.com/shake-effect/ says default direction is "both"
[05:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think that's ever been a valid option.
[05:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> Do either of you know?
[05:19:03] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I was looking at that yesterday. It looks like it takes left/right/up/down but it only seems to do horizontal/vertical.
[05:20:46] <tj_vantoll> I think "both" might mean "left" & "right".
[05:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> left/right/up/down specifies first direction.
[05:23:04] <scott_gonzalez> It alwasy moves in both directions across the axis specified.
[05:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> So left = left, then right
[05:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> right = right, then left
[05:23:34] <tj_vantoll> How do you specify an axis?
[05:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> right/left = horizontal, up/down = vertical
[05:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> You're just additionally specifying which direction along that axis to move first.
[05:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's like bounce, but it always includes the opposing direction as well.
[05:25:49] <tj_vantoll> Ok I see now. The docs could use some help.
[05:29:28] <tj_vantoll> As long as "both" isn't a thing, I could tackle the docs for that. I starting looking into documenting { children: true } as well.
[05:39:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll file an issue for "both" and close the Trac ticket.
[05:41:11] <tj_vantoll> Sounds good. I should be able to tackle the effects docs issues this weekend.
[05:42:05] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[05:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> Hoping to get the 1.10.3 release done today.
[05:42:39] <tj_vantoll> Excellent.
[06:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> hahaha: the title should've been "Dialog: modal prevents focusing on elements outside of the dialog container"
[06:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for letting us know that the code works properly ;-)
[06:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I'm going to fix that shake doc now so it can go into the release.
[06:37:39] <tj_vantoll> Ok.
[06:37:58] <tj_vantoll> Just "both" ‚Äî> "left" right?
[06:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to write a better explanation of what they actually do too.
[06:38:32] <tj_vantoll> Ok good :)
[06:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> The current description isn't very descriptive :-P
[06:39:38] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I didn't tackle the shake issue last night because I had no idea what it was *supposed* to be doing.
[06:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: http://cl.ly/image/350i0Y2z1c3u
[06:48:14] <tj_vantoll> I feel like the first and third sentence are saying the same thing. You could probably just drop the first sentence. Much much better though.
[06:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> Dropped the first sentence and pushed.
[06:54:29] <tj_vantoll> sweet
[07:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> My tolerance for pbwiki has gotten really low.
[07:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> I think I'm going to start the transition away from it this month.
[07:16:30] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that sortable!
[07:16:43] <kborchers> too bad not supported on mobile
[07:16:53] <scott_gonzalez> You've looked at it before?
[07:17:25] <kborchers> no just did and saw tiny JS for sortable and fell in love without really looking through the code ;)
[07:18:43] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's built on the native drag and drop API.
[07:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> But it seems to function well.
[07:19:10] <kborchers> right, which as far as i know doesn't work on mobile
[07:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> And it looks like it's based on our API.
[07:19:35] <kborchers> yeah, i noticed that
[07:20:02] <scott_gonzalez> So it's a good reference, if nothing else for behavioral comparison.
[07:20:09] <kborchers> yep

[07:38:49] <scott_gonzalez> Huh, I just noticed something interesting about MSPointer
[07:39:05] <scott_gonzalez> If you hover with a stylus, you get mousemove events, but not MSPointerMove events.
[07:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin kborchers: ^
[07:39:50] <kborchers> hmm
[07:40:26] <scott_gonzalez> And if you hover from one element to another, you get MSPointerOut and MSPointerOver (plus associated mouse events)
[07:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> But not MSPointerMove
[07:40:58] <kborchers> that seems weird/wrong
[07:41:25] <kborchers> how can a point "move" over or out without triggering a move?
[07:42:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, seems wrong.
[07:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pointer-events/2013AprJun/0134.html
[07:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to send one about the mousemove without MSPointerMove situation too.
[07:47:27] <kborchers> cool
[07:50:25] <kborchers> that button state one is just weird too ‚Ä¶ the way i read it, it says the events should be something like pointerdown, pointermove, pointermove, pointerup, click for mouse and even more events for touch - pointerover, pointerdown, pointermove, pointermove, pointerup, pointerout
[07:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> For your testing pleasure ;-) http://dev-test.nemikor.com/pointer-events.html

[09:35:56] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: looks like you're quite busy so no rush on this one... we have methods that were deprecated in 1.1 or in 1.2 and I am unsure about how they should be documented. jQuery core has a category for deprecated: http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/ 
[09:36:07] <agcolom> Is this something you are considering doing for UI?
[09:37:41] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Just add a deprecated property, same as added.

[10:48:35] <doesallmagic> * Scott Gonz√°lez: 1.10.3
[10:57:10] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: you around?
[10:57:21] <rxaviers> yeap
[10:57:30] <scott_gonzalez> I need your computer for a minute :-)
[10:57:35] <rxaviers> :) sure
[10:58:07] <rxaviers> whats up
[10:58:47] <scott_gonzalez> I just pushed a commit for jqueryui.com to upgrade to 1.10.3
[10:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> I need you to pull, npm install, and create the quick download.
[10:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> I ran the build on the staging server, so the themes zip is correct.
[10:59:46] <scott_gonzalez> But if I create the quick download locally it's going to break.
[10:59:57] <scott_gonzalez> grunt build-download create-quickdownload
[11:00:16] <rxaviers> sure, I'm following the specific part of http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/59346425/Release%20Checklist to do that
[11:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> I did everything except the quick download part.
[11:00:46] <rxaviers> ok
[11:00:51] <scott_gonzalez> So running the grunt command should do everything you need.
[11:01:01] <rxaviers> ok
[11:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure it'll work from your computer, but the easiest way to verify is the unzip and check the index.html file
[11:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> Look at the icons and the modal dialog.
[11:02:41] <rxaviers> ok
[11:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks :-)
[11:03:23] <rxaviers> something is failing on npm install
[11:03:40] <rxaviers> ah the simple-log upgrade isnt commited in master yet
[11:04:17] <rxaviers> well, that affects my installation only. So, I assume it's ok to update it locally and keep running it
[11:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you can update locally or just switch to node 0.8 temporarily.
[11:22:35] <rxaviers> grunt prepare is failing... :(

[11:38:07] <rxaviers> now Im having trouble to create the  dwld
[11:38:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, saw that

[11:38:09] <rxaviers> hang on
[11:38:18] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yeah, it may have worked though :-P
[11:38:24] <DaveMethvin> hover?
[11:38:28] <rxaviers> let me check
[11:38:37] <kborchers> right :/
[11:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yup, that case I mentioned of hovering with the stylus...
[11:39:14] <DaveMethvin> well whaddya know
[11:39:18] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i have no way of testing that :/  ‚Ä¶ i only have a win8 phone
[11:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's an implementation bug anyway.
[11:39:41] <DaveMethvin> i can test
[11:39:51] <scott_gonzalez> It's supposed to be firing MSPointerMove.
[11:40:29] <kborchers> so they will remove hover and add move, correct? if i'm reading that e-mail correctly
[11:40:35] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:40:36] <kborchers> ok
[11:40:54] <scott_gonzalez> So we can probably just convert hover to move in our code.
[11:41:07] <kborchers> sounds good
[11:45:01] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, created, test unzip and index.html seems to show base icons just fine

[12:34:40] <rxaviers> live?
[12:36:29] <rxaviers> stage seems to be with 1.10.3... working... I need to leave now, brb in couple mins
[12:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, production is serving up oops pages
[12:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it's working again.
[12:55:57] <rxaviers> Im back
[12:56:04] <rxaviers> cool
[12:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if it was an issue with jqueryui.com still being on 1.10.2 and download.jqueryui.com being on 1.10.3

[13:39:34] <scott_gonzalez> SLACKER!
[13:39:50] <scott_gonzalez> Probably because you're focusing on new code, not old code.
