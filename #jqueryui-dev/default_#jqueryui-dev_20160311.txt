[09:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts on https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14933?
[10:06:41] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: seems easy enough to solve with customzing accept in the parent

[20:07:22] <intrepidcoder> Hello, I am a student interested in the "jQuery Mobile - Update touch gestures to use Hammer.js" project for GSoC. I'm trying to find the custom touch events in the codebase, are they in js/vmouse.js or in some other file?
