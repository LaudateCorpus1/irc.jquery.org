[08:11:49] <zjs> hey jzaefferer
[08:12:05] <jzaefferer> catching up with work?
[08:18:32] <jzaefferer> zjs: hoping to keep you involved with the project - let me know if you have any questions
[08:18:58] <zjs> yeah; it's amazing how much email can pile up in two days
[08:19:29] <zjs> I'm definitely hoping to stay involved. I'll drop you (or the channel) a message if I have any questions.
[08:21:54] <jzaefferer> We've got plenty work ahead of us :-)
[08:29:52] <gnarf> zjs: I'm afraid to look at my email :)
[08:30:48] <zjs> gnarf: I think putting it off just makes it worse ;-)

[17:33:10] <_zoggy_> Apple has recently released a Mac update for OS X Lion and Mountain Lion that removes its Java plugin from all OS X browsers. If you install the update, you'll find a region labeled "Missing plug-in" in place of a Java applet; of course, Apple can't stop you from clicking on it to download a Java plug-in directly from Oracle.
[20:28:11] <zjs> jzaefferer/gnarf: I submited a PR for my first crack at the Mask syntax additions https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/781/
