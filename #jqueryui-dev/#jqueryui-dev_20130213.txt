[03:17:06] <Jimbo_> Reason: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14851894/jquery-ui-tabs-multiple-instances-linking-to-same-div-set - guys have suggested getting in contact and posting an answer from the horses mouth, so to speak
[03:20:21] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/ApMTQ/2/ -> is this a bug again or did the api change?

[05:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> Jimbo_: We'll never implement that. I don't really feel like writing the code for it in Stack Overflow, and this isn't something that should be answered in here, but I'll give you a very quick answer.
[05:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> When activating a tab in one instance, just set active to false on the other, and initialize both with collapsible: true.
[05:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> If you need more help than that, you'll need to ask for help in #jquery, our forums, or Stack Overflow.
[05:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> DarsVaeda: Not a bug. You can't have multiple elements with the same id, so if you clone, then the id is removed from the clone.
[05:04:18] <DarsVaeda> but why does it work in previous versions?
[05:04:28] <DarsVaeda> also how would you get the id over then?
[05:05:03] <DarsVaeda> shouldn't the element removed from one list and then added to the other list with the same id? I guess that is what happens before
[05:05:11] <DarsVaeda> I mean in earlier versions
[05:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> DarsVaeda: Ask for help in #jquery.
[05:07:08] <scott_gonzalez> This has been discussed a million times already.
[05:08:19] <DarsVaeda> I'm not asking for help, I tried to discuss the "bug" :)
[05:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> DarsVaeda: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4564
[05:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> If you want duplicate ids, create the helper yourself.
[05:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> But you'll be creating an invalid DOM.
[05:10:10] <DarsVaeda> you got me wrong, I want to transfer the id to know what element is moved
[05:10:32] <DarsVaeda> I don't want to create duplicates
[05:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you even using a helper in the first place?
[05:11:09] <Jimbo_> scott_gonzalez: I'll give that a go, cheers!
[05:19:19] <DarsVaeda> I don't get you, you don't get me, I still think the current behavior makes no sense, whatever :)
[05:19:29] <DarsVaeda> thanks anyway!

[08:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Thoughts on https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/106 ?
[08:15:51] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #106 by jzaefferer (2d 1h 18m 17s): Export method for generating themes from a given version and folder
[08:16:12] <rxaviers> reading
[08:16:15] <scott_gonzalez> We're getting that error from the deploy script.
[08:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> Because we try to hijack stuff.
[08:31:56] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jQuery UI's generate_themes task is only used to release_cdn?
[08:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> release_cdn is when we do a full release.
[08:32:25] <rxaviers> any reason why not removing it from jQuery UI grunt and importing it in download builder?
[08:32:46] <rxaviers> we could concentrate the release process in one place
[08:33:42] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[08:33:52] <rxaviers> ok will work on it then
[08:33:57] <rxaviers> is there a date this needs to be ready?
[08:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> So generate_themes() would just be a small wrapper over download builder?
[08:34:10] <rxaviers> yeap, thought so.. A grunt task
[08:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to release today :-P
[08:34:18] <rxaviers> ouch
[08:34:20] <rxaviers> hehe :)
[08:34:22] <rxaviers> ok
[08:34:47] <scott_gonzalez> If we weren't doing a release right now, when do you think you'd have this ready?
[08:35:21] <rxaviers> I havent done any estimation actually. Just wondering.
[08:35:29] <rxaviers> I will work on it right now then
[08:35:48] <rxaviers> I think moving it inside DB will make things easier
[08:36:19] <rxaviers> considering we want to generate_theme of a tagged jquery-ui
[08:37:04] <scott_gonzalez> It's not tagged yet.
[08:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> This is the problem.
[08:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> This task runs in the middle of the release process.
[08:37:35] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why we feed the source into download builder.
[08:38:26] <rxaviers> Does tagged release include such themes?
[08:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> no
[08:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> Tags don't include built themes.
[08:38:44] <rxaviers> ok
[08:39:08] <scott_gonzalez> But we're asking download builder to create themes for 1.10.1, which doesn't exist yet.
[08:39:24] <rxaviers> DB is flexible in the way we reference what jquery-ui we wanna generate the themes from. We can use a tag, a branch or simply master
[08:40:38] <rxaviers> Can't we tag first, then generate the themes? Sorry if it's a dump question
[08:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> We could, but that would mean that we might tag something that won't build.
[08:42:01] <rxaviers> ah ok.. alright
[08:42:09] <rxaviers> so we can dry run it using master
[08:42:12] <rxaviers> first
[08:42:27] <rxaviers> eveything works, we tag, than we commit to DB the tagged version.
[08:42:35] <rxaviers> does it sound good?
[08:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> If we're going to use download builder up front anyway, why not just make it work the way we have it setup now?
[08:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> All we want is to be able to say "here's the source, use this as the prepare step"
[08:43:54] <rxaviers> I see
[08:44:04] <rxaviers> let me think and get back to you
[08:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:52:30] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15NathanaelSilverman opened pull request #914: Sortable: add transparent overlay to style the cursor. (06master...06sortable-cursor)  02http://git.io/CZfn6w
[08:54:24] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I can do exactly what you asked: to make DB to use the current jquery-ui as the source, by: 1) creating the following symlink
[08:54:27] <rxaviers> node_modules/download.jqueryui.com/release/parent -> .
[08:54:41] <rxaviers> 2) making DB necessary adjustments on config.json
[08:54:57] <rxaviers> the above will not work on ms windows
[08:55:11] <rxaviers> is that a problem?
[08:55:42] <rxaviers> the benefits is: it will be very flexible. Whatever commit you are into jquery-ui, that will be used.
[08:56:20] <rxaviers> it won't need the time and disk space of creating the (unnecessary) prepare step (in this case).
[08:56:59] <rxaviers> Sounds good?
[09:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You mean exposing a method where you pass a directory and just have it create a symlink?
[09:01:17] <scott_gonzalez> Or actually committing a symlink into download builder?
[09:01:38] <rxaviers> exposing
[09:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> That should be fine.
[09:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> It only affects the releases, and those aren't done on Windows :-)
[09:02:43] <rxaviers> ok will make a PR and let you know
[09:02:50] <rxaviers> excellent!
