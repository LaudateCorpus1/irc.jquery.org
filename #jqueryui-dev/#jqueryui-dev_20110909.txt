[05:47:05] <jzaefferer> how does that work?
[05:47:14] <jzaefferer> stupid irc
[05:59:26] <erichynds> jzaefferer: ?tell
[06:01:28] <jzaefferer> ?tell timmywill fixed!
[06:01:29] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[06:01:33] <jzaefferer> thanks erichynds
[06:33:01] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Hi Jörn, do you have a couple of mins?
[06:35:53] <jzaefferer> hey rxaviers, yeah, whats up?
[06:38:34] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Hi! Let me introduce myself. My name is Rafael Xavier. I am wondering to include a new widget to jQuery UI. Actually, to revive a past lab widget, called InlineEdit [http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137959/InlineEdit]. Yesterday, I've talked to scott_gonzalez and he pointed me to you to coordinate me so I can help doing it.
[06:42:51] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Should we discuss it prior of me forking and presenting you with a code?
[06:52:35] <rxaviers> [https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui]
[07:03:26] <jzaefferer> well, there's some work on inline editing as part of the grid project - so far all the demos are editing table cells
[07:03:28] <jzaefferer> e.g. http://view.jqueryui.com/grid/grid-editing/grid.html
[07:03:33] <jzaefferer> have you looked at that?
[07:04:04] <jzaefferer> I haven't looked at the InlineEdit page in a while, but thanks for bringing it up.
[07:04:15] <jzaefferer> we should probably move the Editor spec from here over to inlineedit: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40076465/Grid-Editing
[07:04:40] <jzaefferer> did you already start writing any new code?
[07:04:45] <jzaefferer> rxaviers?
[07:04:51] <rxaviers> yep
[07:05:14] <jzaefferer> so, let's try to merge out efforts :-)
[07:05:22] <rxaviers> cool
[07:05:41] <jzaefferer> I'd like to take a look at what you have so far, and I invite you to check the grid editor stuff
[07:05:55] <rxaviers> Ah!! I saw that right now too
[07:06:25] <rxaviers> Ok, sounds fine for me.
[07:07:16] <rxaviers> I liked the way grid editor handles differently each type of data.
[07:09:12] <jzaefferer> so, is there something you can share?
[07:09:30] <jzaefferer> just to take a look, doesn't have to be a fork and everything
[07:09:36] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, please, you can take a look at [https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui]
[07:10:09] <jzaefferer> ah, that is a fork already
[07:11:20] <jzaefferer> looks like a wrapping form, save and cancel buttons are the main difference
[07:11:24] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, yep. Please, check inlineedit branch. Basically, what I have there is the previous widget (from jQuery lab) and updated it to current jQuery version. I've also organized it.
[07:12:09] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, indeed. It's pretty simple.. The main gain will be handling differently each kind of data, like grid editor does.
[07:13:08] <jzaefferer> looking at the demo...
[07:13:32] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, the widget should handle the forms and raise events like edit-save, edit-change, stuff like that to make the editable UI transparent
[07:13:36] <jzaefferer> that's kinda pointless, if there isn't happening anything to sync back the new value
[07:13:40] <jzaefferer> right
[07:13:45] <jzaefferer> do you have those events?
[07:13:48] <rxaviers> yeap
[07:13:54] <rxaviers> the demo doesnt show it yet.
[07:14:00] <rxaviers> but, I will work in a better demo
[07:15:36] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, the way the save and cancel buttons are shown is the way it was before. But, my plan is to let this be chosen by option (something like inlineButton:true). If false, it shows a button "Save", a link "cancel". What do you think?
[07:15:54] <rxaviers> We can also send as an option if the widget will show buttons or not.
[07:16:28] <jzaefferer> buttons aren't that useful in a table
[07:16:46] <jzaefferer> with enter and escape, you don't really need some elsewhere either
[07:17:20] <jzaefferer> but if we provide them, it should be a reasonable default with an option to customize it, preferably a function that can implement whatever else is needed
[07:17:37] <rxaviers> agree
[07:18:22] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Jörn, I am really thinking on changing the name of this widget from Inlineedit to Editable. What do you think?
[07:21:17] <jzaefferer> naming is hard
[07:21:26] <jzaefferer> inlineedit is pretty bad, I agree with that
[07:21:35] <jzaefferer> editable is a little bit too generic
[07:21:39] <jzaefferer> same for editor
[07:23:42] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, feedback welcome :)
[07:24:05] <rxaviers> s/feedback/suggestion
[07:24:41] <jzaefferer> ajpiano gnarf kborchers: any opinions on inlineedit vs editable vs editor?
[07:24:44] <rxaviers> so far, what I have found for this purpose is: in-place-editor, inline-edit, editable, editor
[07:24:59] <ajpiano> edtiable
[07:25:06] <kborchers> also like editable
[07:25:06] <rxaviers> ah! and toggleEdit
[07:26:13] <kborchers> not sure if that's really that much better than inlineEdit though ...
[07:26:45] * rxaviers votes in editable
[07:26:51] <rxaviers> just raising alternatives
[07:27:34] <kborchers> how about superdupereditwhenyouclickthing ;)
[07:27:40] <rxaviers> LOL
[07:28:29] <kborchers> i would say editable though works for me ... can't think of anything better right now
[07:29:25] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, so, I will change the name to editable and if we come with something better, may rename it again. Does it sound good?
[07:33:20] <ajpiano> rxaviers: i would second your thought of having a buttons option
[07:33:36] <ajpiano> cause i've built something similar... didn't want buttons for the table, but did in other contexts
[07:35:31] <rxaviers> ajpiano, good to know.. Clarifying: when you second my thought, are you with me right?
[07:35:47] <ajpiano> yes!
[07:36:07] <rxaviers> :)
[07:36:33] <rxaviers> ajpiano, kborchers, jzaefferer, so when I have updates I let you know
[07:36:44] <rxaviers> 'll*
[07:49:13] <jzaefferer> okay, let's rename to editable then
[07:49:29] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the spec on the Grid-Editing page lists some methods and events
[07:49:35] <jzaefferer> does that look like a good starting point?
[07:49:44] <jzaefferer> would move it over to the editable page then
[07:50:45] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, sure. When you refere the editable page, is it some jquery UI wiki? Or my demo page?
[07:52:15] <jzaefferer> wiki
[07:53:17] <rxaviers> ok, is it something you will do, or I can do? (sorry so many questions)
[07:56:02] <jzaefferer> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137959/Editable
[07:56:26] <jzaefferer> now the 'editor' option is less awkward :-)
[07:59:38] <rxaviers> very good, I suggest one more event: change (triggered when submitted, but only when data is changed)
[08:11:47] <jzaefferer> makes sense
[08:11:54] <jzaefferer> can you add that?
[08:14:12] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, sure
[10:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> hah, kborchers check out http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6763
[10:38:56] <kborchers> that's awesome! :/
[10:39:33] <kborchers> just call it the flying button feature for opera and call it a day ;)
