[07:41:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: any feedback on that simple server?
[07:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> Seems out of scope for that repo.
[07:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> Will it be easier for you to mange the servers if it's in that repo instead of the infra repo?
[07:42:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: also - fyi - node-syslog was behaving very oddly
[07:42:51] <scott_gonzalez> oh?
[07:42:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: a little, mainly because of the package.json
[07:43:11] <gnarf> it wouldn't work under 0.8 because it was compiling Debug/ but expecting Release/
[07:43:13] <gnarf> or something
[07:43:36] <gnarf> also, that version of node-syslog that requires 0.8 really does require 0.8 ;)
[07:43:46] <gnarf> it wont compile properly under 0.6.x
[07:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> It was running on 0.6.20 for me.
[07:44:13] <gnarf> hrm
[07:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, if we can get everything working on 0.8.x that's what we want.
[07:44:21] <gnarf> i got nothing but issues trying to work with it
[07:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try to install it using 0.8.
[07:45:14] <gnarf> under 0.8.4 or under 0.6.14
[07:46:46] <gnarf> as far as it being any "easier" within the repo - I might just fork it and clone from mine then, if you wanna keep it out of there - it seems like it would be easier to pull the whole structure including that server so if we ever push an update the notifier can update itself
[07:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I'm getting the Debug/Release issue with 0.8.
[07:47:22] <gnarf> also, much easier to rely on package.json installing those libs than trying to detect them
[07:47:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: apparently the "bindings" module could fix it
[07:47:42] <gnarf> but i didn't spend enough time tracking it down
[07:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...."Node-syslog doesn't support Darwin OS and MS Windows, but should work fine with this OSes."
[07:51:00] <gnarf> i suppose i could make my notifier-server.js its own repo that package.json requires yours
[07:51:26] <gnarf> i agree that it doesn't really seem "in scope" for the basic utility lib
[07:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> That would work.
[07:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> So it seems like this is working for you?
[07:56:04] <scott_gonzalez> If so, I'll add a readme and publish to npm.
[07:59:23] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[07:59:24] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.6.x core build #12: FIXED in 27 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.6.x%20core/12/
[07:59:24] <doesallmagic> joern.zaefferer: Build: Include *.jquery.json files in release
[08:01:17] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I've pushed a bunch of updates for download builder, should address the issues you brought up. Let me know if you need something else
[08:03:58] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: did we change something or did the effects failure just disappear now?
[08:04:02] <jzaefferer> git core build passed...
[08:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing changed.
[08:05:32] <gnarf> jzaefferer: cool, I'll look tomorrow
[08:05:37] <gnarf> or later tonight
[08:05:49] <gnarf> today's a "day job" day for the most part
[08:06:08] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:06:48] <jzaefferer> I'll have time to work on more things tomorrow, then only Friday next week again
[08:18:39] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[08:18:40] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.7.x core build #12: FIXED in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.7.x%20core/12/

[08:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: How do I get grunt-jquery-content to style the API examples as HTML instead of JS for the code highlighter?
[08:48:14] <scott_gonzalez> (yes, I'm actually working on the API site now)
[08:52:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: it doesn't auto-detect?
[08:53:40] <scott_gonzalez> Nope.
[08:53:57] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see anything in the generated markup signifying what language it thinks it is either.
[08:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> <div id="highlighter_296503" class="syntaxhighlighter  ">
[08:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/3k033l1d1u14
[09:00:43] <jzaefferer> that is odd, as it works fine for various html snippets on the QUnit site
[09:18:45] <jzaefferer> awesome bug: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/116 "On 1 January 2011, Estonia changed over to the euro."
