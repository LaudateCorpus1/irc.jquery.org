[03:12:17] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Hi JÃ¶rn! Implementing spinner on Editable I faced an issue, I'd like to have your opinion on which way do you think it should be fixed... May I show it to you? It's under https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/tree/editable-spinner
[03:22:03] <rxaviers> on ./demos/editable/editors.html
[05:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> I want to add a new resolution of "wat?" to Trac
[06:06:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hah ... you did add #8053 to "the list" right?
[06:58:15] <jzaefferer> hey rxaviers, so what's the issue with editable-spinner?
[06:58:15] <bot-t1> (45 hours 20 mins ago) <kborchers> tell jzaefferer i would appreciate any input on further unit tests you would like to see in menu. /cc scott_gonzalez rworth gnarf
[07:13:13] <jedmtnman> hey guys, is there access to the vector file for the icons sprite in jqueryui in the repo? I didn't find it on a first look.
[07:45:00] <rworth> the current icon sprite file is not froma vector file, it's a bitmap done by hand in PhotoShop
[07:46:11] <rworth> jedmtnman: there is some discussion on the wiki about doing vector icons in the future, and some work to that end, but that is far from finished
[07:51:18] <jedmtnman> rworth: thanks, so the best way to get bigger icons, is just to resize the current sprite?
[07:52:06] <rworth> yes, though a theme will have something like 5-6 copies of it for various states, so it will be more than one image file
[07:52:30] <rworth> but if you perform the same resize on each one, should be fine
[07:53:48] <scott_gonzalez> heh, kborchers: it's on the list :-)
[07:54:03] <kborchers> :)
[07:56:43] <jedmtnman> ok, rworth thats what i needed to know. thanks again.

[15:12:48] <laurenty> at least it's failing a lot faster
[15:17:13] <clarkbox> ha... its not a good sign. it cant even start the build
[15:19:13] <clarkbox> jenkins was not able to start a build. it was always failing and saying "cannot allocate memory"
[15:19:20] <clarkbox> i shut it down, and now it wont start...
[15:19:32] <clarkbox> Starting Jenkins initial fork failed: Cannot allocate memory
[15:19:50] <clarkbox> danheberden jzaefferer ^
[15:44:26] <clarkbox> k got it started. had to indiscriminately kill some java process. could have been hanging around from jenkins before i stopped it using the init.d script
