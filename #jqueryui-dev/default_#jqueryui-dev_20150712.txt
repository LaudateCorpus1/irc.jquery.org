[05:06:07] <Terrdus> hello :) any jqueryUI dev here?
[09:47:51] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: gabrielschulhof: isn't data-mini="true" on a controlgroup still supposed to work? currently it doesn't in 1.5-dev
[09:48:45] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yes it should
[09:49:50] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: but you are correct the backcompat is not applying it for some reason
[09:50:11] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ok, something we have to look into
[09:59:08] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i found the problem ill push a fix shortly
[09:59:18] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: great, thanks!
[10:22:27] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: did you see my message Thursday about reverting https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/91ac2c2375124fa496bea5298343fbd0b5d7b5b2 ?
[10:26:27] <jasperdegroot> we use class ui-helper-hidden-accessible to hide native checkbox and radio inputs so those are broken now the CSS for it has been removed
[10:27:31] <jasperdegroot> however, doesn't UI just use display none for those instead of hiding them accessibly?
