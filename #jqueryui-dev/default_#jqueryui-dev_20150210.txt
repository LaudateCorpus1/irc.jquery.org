[08:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Are you aware that there are feature request in wiki pages instead of issues?
[08:11:22] <scott_gonzalez> They're really old.
[08:11:22] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/request:-optional-markup-enhancements
[08:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Request:-Change-verticalDistanceThreshold-to-swipeSupressionThreshold-for-consistency
[08:11:38] <arschmitz> Yes iv been meaning to clean out the wikis
[08:12:00] <arschmitz> most of them can just be deleted at this point because they are horribly outdated and about old stuff
[08:16:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz, scott_gonzalez: I've just sent an email to the combined list of addresses that have materialized as a result of last week's discussion. I gave a really brief summary of what we talked about, but I'm sure you can chime in with more.
[08:16:37] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers_: ^
[08:16:48] <scott_gonzalez> I saw, thanks.
[08:16:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Talking about RTL, sorry.
[08:35:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Do we have any rules about commits that touch multiple (but not all) components? Can I say, like, "Demos and Tests: Remove reference to $.mobile.pageContainer"?
[08:35:31] <gabriel_schulhof> This is almost certainly gonna get squashed in the final merge, but still - just curious ...
[10:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> gabriel_schulhof: That's fine.
[13:38:24] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: OK. Thanks!
[14:13:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice job with the CLA checking!
