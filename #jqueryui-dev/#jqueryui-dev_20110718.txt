[07:08:34] <NL_Ed> Hi all, who can help me with multiselect
[07:14:24] <gnarf> ?topic @NL_Ed
[07:14:24] <bot-t> NL_Ed, Topic: jQuery UI development (support at #jquery, core dev at #jquery-dev) Overview: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/ - meeting at Wednesday, 12pm Eastern (9am Pacific, 6:00pm CEST), in #jquery-meeting - Agenda: http://bit.ly/jqueryui-agenda
[07:15:08] <NL_Ed> So I'm in the wrong channel?
[07:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> NL_Ed, gnarf: this is the correct channel to discuss plugins that are in development
[07:16:30] <gnarf> oh
[07:16:36] <gnarf> sorry
[07:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> nobody else would be able to help with a plugin that hasn't been released yet
[07:16:50] <gnarf> true
[07:16:57] <gnarf> since i hadn't heard of it
[07:17:04] <gnarf> I assumed that it was a plugin that wasn't ours ;)
[07:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> heh, yeah, so I guess that's the first question
[07:17:27] <gnarf> either way, see ?ask @NL_Ed
[07:17:28] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:17:33] <gnarf> :)
[07:17:38] <NL_Ed> argh im confused now
[07:17:38] <scott_gonzalez> NL_Ed: are you referring to http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138021/Multiselect ?
[07:17:53] <kborchers> gnarf: i through that one at him in #jquery too ;)
[07:17:58] <scott_gonzalez> or are you asking about an existing plugin that has been released?
[07:19:05] <NL_Ed> Let me find the link
[07:19:43] <NL_Ed> this thing http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/
[07:20:14] <NL_Ed> I need to trigger a function when a box is checked so I can hide show some elements on the page
[07:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> you'll need to ask Eric Hynds about that
[07:20:37] <scott_gonzalez> and tell him to stop calling it the jQuery UI MultiSelect
[07:20:41] <scott_gonzalez> since it's not part of jQuery UI
[07:20:55] <NL_Ed> Ah, there's my problem then
[07:21:24] <NL_Ed> I'll keep trying different things
[07:21:31] <NL_Ed> Thanks for the help :)
[07:21:40] <kborchers> NL_Ed: erichynds is pretty active in #jquery so you should ask him there
[07:23:10] <NL_Ed> Ah cheers
[07:26:28] <gnarf> heh
[07:27:11] <NL_Ed> So this channel is for people developing UI plugins>
[07:27:13] <NL_Ed> ?*
[07:28:40] <gnarf> kinda
[07:28:45] <gnarf> its for the people developing jQuery UI
[07:29:19] <scott_gonzalez> if you have questions about a plugin actively in development that hasn't been released, this is the place
[07:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> also, if you want to discuss the actual development of existing plugins, this is the place
[07:29:38] <NL_Ed> ah, so basically you're the guys who made UI?
[07:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> but if you want help using a released plugin, then #jquery is the place
[07:30:12] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, plus some others who are just here to help answer questions or lurk
[07:30:24] <NL_Ed> nice, your all amazing :)
[07:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[07:31:46] <NL_Ed> Im presuming you have a day time job too?
[07:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> yes, though for the past year part of my day job is working on jQuery UI
[07:43:56] <scott_gonzalez> there were several years when that wasn't the case
[07:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> still managed to get 20-40 hrs/wk in, though having kids changed that
[07:44:53] <NL_Ed> Nice
[07:44:58] <NL_Ed> bet that knackered you
[07:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, kids take a lot of time :-P
[08:24:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not sure if you saw the convo in #jquery but i think erichynds will be changing the name of his multiselect widget. if you need any other enforcing done, just let me know. ;)
[08:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I saw (only because you mentioned me). Thanks for letting him know
[08:26:36] <kborchers> i figured you would see, that's why i mentioned you but didn't know if you paid much attention to that channel
[08:27:36] <NL_Ed> I wanted him first :p now he's gone to sort the name out
[10:42:40] <ryankshaw> hey guys, so I need to build something very similar to fillament group's ipod-style drilldown menu http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_ipod_style_and_flyout_menus for something I am working.  I took a look at the 'menu' planning page on the wiki http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu  and it looks like you want to be able to support this. I looked at the code on master on github and it is not there yet, so I am go
[10:42:40] <ryankshaw> add it in and send a pull request to merge it back in (if you like it, of course).
[10:43:49] <ryankshaw> just want to make sure that the 'ipod-style drilldown' is something you still want to do in the core Menu widget before I start worring about making something good enough to get merged back in.
[10:46:56] <kborchers> ryankshaw: that is already built in. see http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/menu/menu.html
[10:48:23] <ryankshaw> I dont see anything there that does the 'ipod style drilldown' like this: http://www.filamentgroup.com/examples/menus/ipod.php
[10:48:31] <ryankshaw> am I not seeing something?
[10:49:14] <kborchers> ryankshaw: oh, i see. sorry, i was looking at the wrong menu on your first link.
[10:49:46] <ryankshaw> but the planning wiki does talk about it (look for: ipod-style/drilldown [D6 and D7] on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu )
[10:51:16] <ryankshaw> that is what I was going to build out.    the Visual Design section on that page shows how it should look (which is pretty much the same as that fillament group demo)  I was just going to try to do it like that.
[10:51:37] <kborchers> ryankshaw: someone else is already working on this though not sure if they still are http://jamesarosen.github.com/jquery-ui/demos/menu/ios-menu.html
[10:53:26] <ryankshaw> yea I saw that, it looks like he is doing i-os style scrolling and adding a back functionality but no breadcrumb.  I was going to base a lot of it on his, some from fillament group's and try to come up with something more fleshed out.
[10:54:59] <ryankshaw> but that does bring up a good question.  would a native scrollbar (like: http://www.filamentgroup.com/examples/menus/ipod.php or an iOS one like: http://jamesarosen.github.com/jquery-ui/demos/menu/ios-menu.html) be better for the finished product?
[10:57:08] <kborchers> ryankshaw: i would say go for it. i have been doing most, if not all of the development on menu lately and just haven't gotten there yet. just going down the list, you know. ;) make a comment or edit that page to let us know you're working on it so someone else doesn't duplicate the effort
[10:57:34] <ryankshaw> ok cool.
[10:57:35] <kborchers> you may also want to message jamesarosen to make sure he isn't still working on it https://github.com/jamesarosen
[10:58:00] <ryankshaw> ok I will.  thanks.
[11:13:20] <kborchers[A]> jzaefferer: u there?
[11:21:53] <jzaefferer> kinda
[11:23:20] <jzaefferer> kborchers: poing
[11:24:01] <kborchers> jzaefferer: just wondering if you have any suggestion. i am working on nav menu, got it mostly working
[11:24:41] <jzaefferer> as in building a demo ala amazon navigation menu?
[11:25:13] <kborchers> yes, and since you can't simulate a click on a link to follow the href, i'm using window.open. works fine for same window but trying to respect if someone uses "_blank". problem is popup blockers don't like that
[11:25:42] <kborchers> this is all for keyboard nav, clicking works fine
[11:27:15] <jzaefferer> what's wrong with just trigger a click event?
[11:27:48] <jzaefferer> also for a demo like that with actual page links, a query param as the href can help
[11:27:57] <jzaefferer> href="?page1", href="?page2"...
[11:28:08] <jzaefferer> shouldn't have to open a new window
[11:29:53] <jzaefferer> in general for stuff like that, if the TODO is very generic, just ask for clarification before starting to work on it
[11:30:08] <kborchers> triggering click was not actually following the href. thought maybe it was a prevent default somewhere but couldn't track it down.
[11:30:21] <kborchers> only triggers an onclick if it exists
[11:31:08] <jzaefferer> in that case, push it to a branch, ping me about it / mention it on the wiki page, and go on with something else
[11:31:29] <jzaefferer> how much time did you spend on it so far?
[11:32:27] <kborchers> not too long ... but enough ;) https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/tree/menu_navigation
[11:37:37] <jzaefferer> yeah, that additional menu code is probably not something we want to land as-is
[11:40:38] <kborchers> any thoughts on how to trigger those clicks? does js even allow you to trigger the default action of a link, i didn't think it did for some reason which is why i went the window.open route
[11:48:22] <gnarf> kborchers: no
[11:48:34] <gnarf> you can't reliably .click() an
[11:48:35] <gnarf> a
[11:48:43] <gnarf> in fact afaik NO browser supports it
[11:48:54] <gnarf> window.location=this.href is about the best u get
[11:49:02] <gnarf> no way to do ctrl+click, etc
[11:49:29] <kborchers> gnarf: didn't think so. any suggestion on how to make a navigation menu keyboard accessible and respect the target attr or should i give up that pipe dream?
[11:50:17] <gnarf> um
[11:50:28] <gnarf> doesn't the natural keypress follow the link?
[11:50:37] <gnarf> like if you tab to an a and hit "enter"
[11:52:06] <kborchers> i thought it would but there must be somewhere in menu that is stopping that because it doesn't work. it just firest the select event. tried removing every preventDefault() etc, that i could find and still didn't work
[11:52:11] <gnarf> hrm seems only "space"
[11:52:22] <gnarf> try that?
[11:52:40] <kborchers> hmmm, maybe because i was testing enter. thought i had tried space too but i will look again
[11:52:50] <gnarf> nvm
[11:52:56] <gnarf> i guess its enter
[11:53:07] <gnarf> just the space is actually firing keypress :)
[11:53:59] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/GkkRL/ tabbing + enter = works here
[11:54:24] <gnarf> does it stopProp/preventDefault on keydown or keyup?
[11:54:48] <kborchers> gnarf: yes but i had removed those and still didn't work
[11:55:26] <gnarf> and it is actually the <a> with focus right?
[11:55:36] <gnarf> not some containing replacement div or something
[11:56:44] <gnarf> i.e. document.activeElement.tagName === 'a'
[11:56:49] <gnarf> or 'A'
[11:57:16] <gnarf> kborchers: have you tried capturing a timeline?
[11:57:22] <gnarf> in chrome dev tools?
[11:57:35] <gnarf> you might be getting handled by an event handler you haven't thought abobut yet
[11:58:01] <kborchers> crap, i think it's the li with the focus which is why the keypress doesn't work.
[12:00:29] <kborchers> and if i move focus from the li, it will mess with the rest of the keyboard nav. damn. ok, at least i have somewhere to go from now. thanks gnarf!
[12:01:59] <gnarf> kborchers: the actual focus should be on the <a> i think
[12:02:19] <gnarf> and you should potentially .delegate() the event on the li
[12:02:22] <gnarf> instead of .bind()
[12:02:29] <gnarf> but either wa
[12:02:31] <gnarf> way
[12:02:38] <gnarf> you'll pick up bubbles i think
[12:03:48] <kborchers> ok, thanks.
[12:05:21] <gnarf> .bind is smarter
[12:05:43] <gnarf> .delegate() if you only want to get events on "a"s or whatever
[12:06:07] <gnarf> but if you just want the core keycodes etc, you can prolly catch the bubble on the li
[12:14:51] <gnarf> when is the grid meeting?
[12:14:55] <gnarf> after our ui meeting right?
[12:18:03] <kborchers> yep
[12:18:29] <kborchers> noon CST
[12:29:17] <gnarf> do we have any logic in tooltip for sticky yet?  i have to tackle a sticky tooltip for a project
[12:50:21] <jzaefferer> gnarf, no, we don't, and I'm interested in keeping it that way
[12:50:34] <jzaefferer> but open to discussion with some context/a usecase
[12:50:44] <gnarf> my project is raw js
[12:50:48] <gnarf> so im not gonna be using it
[12:50:57] <gnarf> was just hoping there might be some "smart logic" in there to peek at
[12:50:58] <gnarf> :)
[12:51:53] <gnarf> the design I'm playin with atm basically revolves around tracking the users mouse, if they pause over an item for ___ms its tooltip "sticks" until you move your mouse ___ away from the tip itself
[12:52:41] <jzaefferer> I'm happy to discuss that anyway
[12:52:46] <jzaefferer> need some more context...
[13:04:21] <gnarf> i want my tooltips to be able to have tooltips
[13:04:36] <gnarf> the tooltips are for "records" in the db, which can reference other records
[13:05:08] <gnarf> just thinking user experience wise...
[23:30:42] <wwalser> Anyone know if $.simulate makes native events for things like pressing the left and right arrow keys happen?
