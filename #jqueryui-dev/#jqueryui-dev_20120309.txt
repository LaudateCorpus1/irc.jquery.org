[04:40:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i've just been looking through the $.browser stuff and that came up in my search. just wanted to make sure i wasn't crazy

[06:33:16] <DaveMethvin> kborchers: did you ever get your answer about bgiframe? it's using that crazy .createElement("<html>") syntax but only for ie6
[06:35:00] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: i was just asking about the redundency of $.browser.msie and a regex agains the user agent. just wondering why he did both
[06:35:44] <DaveMethvin> oic kborchers
[06:35:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah, could have used $.browser.version as well i guess
[06:37:29] <kborchers> i'm going through ui and looking at removing/documenting the use of $.browser and that just came up in my search and i thought it was silly to do both when the regex would get you msie 6.0
[06:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: It wasn't always like that :-P

[06:40:49] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on bgiframe by Brandon Aaron (2y, 3w ago): updating readme, a few tweaks, fixed visual test
[06:41:07] <scott_gonzalez> I think there may even be a related bug in the Trac.
[06:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6033
[06:42:01] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? That's filed against position.
[06:42:38] <kborchers> heh
[06:44:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: unless i'm missing something (and i could be), that still wouldn't justify both being there would it? There aren't any browsers other than IE6 that would have "msie 6.0" in the user agent are there?
[06:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it justifies it, but might explain it.
[06:44:41] <scott_gonzalez> Someone probably filed a bug and said "If I change the regex..."
[06:44:54] <kborchers> yeah
[06:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> And Brandon just didn't think twice about it.
[06:45:38] <kborchers> do i remember core planning to move $.browser to a plugin or something like that?
[06:46:43] <DaveMethvin> kborchers: yep
[06:47:33] <DaveMethvin> our current plan is for there to be a separate plugin available for 1.8 but it won't be removed from core until 1.9 or later
[06:48:19] <kborchers> ok, that's what i thought.
