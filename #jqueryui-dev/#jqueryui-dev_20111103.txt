[00:40:14] <everettz> I'm going to be doing some accessibility of Core plugins. is MASTER the best branch to be using?
[00:40:22] <everettz> * accessibility testing
[04:59:38] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, There are some spec I would like to discuss w/ you and the team about Editable:
[04:59:38] <rxaviers> I am implementing textarea editor.. What do we do with the save and cancel buttons? Should we place them differently, like on beneath textarea (the way jeditable does)? If so, should we give user the ability of changing the default using options for:
[04:59:38] <rxaviers> a) button positioning: maybe we can give user the ability to choose where to anchor buttons between: [ne, se, sw, nw];
[04:59:40] <rxaviers> b) buttons order: save, cancel vs. cancel, save. Use an array like buttons: [button1, button2]?
[05:01:56] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: order should just depend on the propery order in the buttons object
[05:02:09] <jzaefferer> it may not be in the spec, but its implemented everywhere anyway
[05:02:37] <jzaefferer> as for textarea positioning: follow jeditable sounds reasonable, can you prototype that and share?
[05:02:59] <jzaefferer> custom positioning should be done using a start-event or somthing like that
[05:03:21] <jzaefferer> not something we'd want to support, at least not from the start, with an additional option

[17:51:55] <gnarf> can we make .simulate("blur", callback) ?
[17:52:07] <gnarf> to make it more obvious that its async?
