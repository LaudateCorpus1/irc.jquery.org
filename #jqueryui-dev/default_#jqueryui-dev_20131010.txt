[06:35:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Morning
[06:35:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: morning
[06:35:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how's the summit?
[06:35:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: are the test pages you made still in the library somewhere
[06:36:00] <arschmitz> does not start until 1
[06:36:05] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:36:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what test pages?
[06:36:22] <arschmitz> sorry should be more specific lol the external panel and toolbar ones
[06:36:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, one moment
[06:37:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/panel-examples/
[06:37:16] <arschmitz> i fixed the issue with the swipe demos and position relative on pages and i want to see how jumpy it makes footer
[06:37:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: external header and left panel, internal footer and right panel
[06:37:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah ill have to modify it a bit but it so so i can see i wont commit
[06:37:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: external non-fixed header and toolbar http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/toolbar-external/
[06:38:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i need an external non-fixed footer lol
[06:38:20] <uGoMobi> and footer*
[06:38:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe we need to add a second page to demo to test this
[06:40:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah ill check it out
[06:40:56] <uGoMobi> ok great
[06:53:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok it does not look bad at all i dont think
[06:54:35] <arschmitz> all you see is the content drop down the height of the toolbar as the transition ends
[06:55:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and maybe when we look into nav and transitions again we can come up with a way to avoid it but for now i think its ok
[06:55:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you testing two pages with different content (height) ?
[06:55:30] <arschmitz> yes
[06:55:37] <arschmitz> one has a single line of content 
[06:55:43] <arschmitz> and the other has a whole bunch
[06:55:58] <uGoMobi> right
[06:56:11] <uGoMobi> so the footer jumps to the bottom of the content
[06:56:21] <arschmitz> no actually you dont see footer at all
[06:56:35] <arschmitz> its the content that jumps down a little when it gets set to relative
[06:56:51] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[06:57:22] <uGoMobi> is there an explanation for why that happens?
[06:57:44] <arschmitz> yes because when its absolute it does not account for height of toolbars
[06:57:54] <arschmitz> when it is relative it moves below
[06:58:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and on a reverse transition the footer just appears in place toward end but with no jump
[06:58:36] <arschmitz> assuming its in view to see this based on length of page
[06:58:42] <arschmitz> other wise you see nothing
[06:59:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[06:59:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i tested with slide transition also since that will be most trouble some because both pages are there at same time
[06:59:50] <arschmitz> which was the problem in the swipe demo
[06:59:57] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:00:08] <arschmitz> swipe demo is perfect now though because that uses fixed
[07:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ping
[07:00:23] <arschmitz> the jump is only in non-fixed
[07:00:28] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I have a gift for you :-)
[07:01:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, you only set pages with non-fixed toolbars to position relative now
[07:01:21] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: you magically fixed pointer events job done lol ? ( kborchers is probably either on plane or at airport )
[07:01:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[07:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yup, we did :-)
[07:01:43] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: you guys rock
[07:01:55] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: awesome
[07:02:21] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[07:03:51] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: if i see kborchers before he checks in ill let him know you guys have a surprise for him 
[07:03:57] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[07:04:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[07:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks arschmitz
[07:04:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I saw what you guys talked about at web-ui-fw channel during your meeting
[07:04:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: oh iv been meaning to tell you i found a very fundamental flaw in our back button handling 
[07:05:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh no ...
[07:05:26] <arschmitz> if you have a page you go to with data-ajax false
[07:05:29] <arschmitz> then hit back
[07:05:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, if you want us to work on some widgets, we can do that and put 'em in web-ui-fw 0.3.0
[07:05:43] <arschmitz> it will load via ajax
[07:05:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[07:05:58] <arschmitz> or if you have a non jqm page that links to a jqm page on same domain
[07:06:01] <arschmitz> then hit back
[07:06:08] <arschmitz> it will load it via ajax as a jqm page
[07:06:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's great
[07:06:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's that subway map widget, but we can also work on others.
[07:07:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's discuss look into this when we discuss our new roadmap
[07:07:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I want to put that on agenda for meeting in Amsterdam
[07:07:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was thinking about this one: http://web-ui-fw.github.io/#optionheader-demo
[07:08:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: this is kinda a major issue in our history handling 
[07:09:02] <arschmitz> its not new or anything but still major issue
[07:09:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed. However, now that we have the back() function in the pagecontainer, we can simply check if we're going back and we're on the first urlHistory entry, right?
[07:09:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: seems like if the page is not in our internal history stack and its from back button it hsould be ajax false
[07:10:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[07:10:26] <arschmitz> the back method already solves half of this
[07:10:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, that may not be the right way. We should do it from the click handler, because we need to not prevent default.
[07:10:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that would not handle native back button
[07:10:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right.
[07:11:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, so we need to do it from page container. You're right ...
[07:11:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont think we should fix for 1.4 though
[07:11:40] <arschmitz> 1.4.1 maybe
[07:11:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[07:11:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll file an issue.
[07:12:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we will need to add a bunch of tests for it and i think its just too late
[07:12:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. It's actually kinda hard to devise tests for this, too, IIRC, because you kinda fall of the edge of the world - I mean, qunit and everything is supposed to get unloaded as part of the test.
[07:13:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right we will have to put some thought into it

[07:18:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I made a list of things to consider for our roadmap. I will create a Google doc for it soon and share it with the team. Maybe you can add the web-ui-fw widgets to that list
[07:18:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: might be good to discuss that list already a bit before Amsterdam
[07:23:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.

[12:20:31] <ajpiano> lol
[12:25:33] <rxaviers> gnarf, scott_gonzalez, hey guys. DB has been down a lot this week. The first time I looked the logs something called my attention. A lot of cache cleanups in the same interval (correct would be one message per entity: 1 per Images, 1 per builds)
[12:25:47] <rxaviers> I'd like to add a logger.log to do some investigations.
[12:26:09] <rxaviers> I've done that actually. Are you ok if I restart the service now to get these new messages (on server log)
[12:26:11] <rxaviers> ?
[12:26:22] <gnarf> rxaviers: make sure it doesn't explode in size 
[12:26:28] <gnarf> check drive space
[12:26:33] <gnarf> but go for it
[12:26:44] <rxaviers> ok
[12:26:56] <rxaviers> If messages goes crazy I revert it and reset it again
[12:27:01] <rxaviers> go*
[12:27:04] <gnarf> ^ that
[12:27:14] <gnarf> monitor closely over next 24h
[12:27:17] <gnarf> with logs on
[12:27:28] <gnarf> don't forget about it though ;)
[12:27:54] <rxaviers> Sure, my intention is keep this on during ~30mins
[12:28:09] <rxaviers> (is to keep this on for about)*
[12:33:17] <rxaviers> restarted, and nothing happened as expected
[12:33:39] <rxaviers> oh shoot. Just saw what was wrong kkkk jeez
[12:34:06] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/lib/cache.js#L24
[12:34:13] <rxaviers> this should be out of this scope
[12:35:10] <rxaviers> Every time cache is cleaned, it auto sets up a next clean. But,  growing geometrically
[12:35:21] <rxaviers> fixing
