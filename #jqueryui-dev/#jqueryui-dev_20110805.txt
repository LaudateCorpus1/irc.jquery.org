[06:16:09] <kborchers> jzaefferer: saw your comments on the position PR, thanks. I noticed things weren't working right last night which is why I updated the wiki to say i'm working on it. I'll recommit once it's figured out.
[06:18:04] <kborchers> i also noticed that i should probably change or add some unit tests as most of the tests now show when it shouldn't flip instead of when it should
[07:39:04] <wwalser> jzaefferer: you around?
[08:10:56] <jzaefferer> wwalser: not really, about to head out, let's chat next week? or maybe over the weekend
[08:15:51] <wwalser> sure thing
[13:35:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[13:39:32] <scott_gonzalez> yes, though partially busy and leaving soon
[13:39:33] <bot-t> (25 hours 9 mins ago) <timmywil> tell scott_gonzalez: I'm not able to reproduce on my end, but add this somewhere and let me know if it fixes the problem: jQuery.propHooks.tabIndex = jQuery.attrHooks.tabIndex;
[13:39:33] <bot-t> (23 hours 50 mins ago) <timmywil> tell scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/compare/dbefda2%5E...981bcdc
[13:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> what's up?
[13:40:02] <kborchers> i also have to leave soon
[13:40:21] <kborchers> wondering if you understand why https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/position/position_core_within.js#L260 sets within and of to the same element?
[13:40:36] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: prop and attr will do the same thing for tabindex in 1.6.3
[13:40:41] <kborchers> it's really messing with me
[13:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: thanks, good to know
[13:43:22] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: not sure, I forget who added the within prop
[13:44:03] <kborchers> just doesn't seem to make sense to me since wouldn't you just use of at that point. it's completely throwing my math for a loop in collision detection
[13:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it doesn't make sense
[13:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> if you don't fit within the element, no form of collision detection will help
[13:44:56] <scott_gonzalez> well...
[13:45:20] <scott_gonzalez> maybe something like: my: "top left", at: "top center", collision: "fit"
[13:45:29] <kborchers> i should say this is only making a mess in flip, fit seems ok
[13:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> but flip would never make sense
[13:46:57] <kborchers> ok, then maybe i'll just use the collisionTest function for fit tests and use collisionTest2 for flip and see if that helps. glad i'm not crazy. thanks and have a good weekend
[13:51:12] <kborchers> actually, i'll have to write a collisionTest3 but what ever
