[04:49:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[04:49:51] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[04:50:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Are we deprecating inset?
[04:50:36] <gabriel_schulhof> It's a boolean style property.
[04:50:45] <arschmitz> yes
[04:50:48] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[04:51:16] <gabriel_schulhof> There's that interaction between inset and corners. If inset is false, corners must have no effect. Ideally, this should be rendered in CSS.
[04:51:38] <arschmitz> you can do it through classes but we need to document where to add these if its not ui-flipswitch or equilivlent
[04:51:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: nah they are not options
[04:52:00] <arschmitz> if you set incompatible css thats your own fault
[04:52:08] <gabriel_schulhof> The good news is that listview wasn't reviewed so we don't actually have to make the option work on the fly.
[04:52:13] <arschmitz> no different then if you add your own class and it breaks layout
[04:52:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[04:52:32] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Good.
[04:52:33] <arschmitz> we would say will dont do that!
[04:52:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. If you add inset turn off corners, for Heaven's sake :)
[04:52:53] <arschmitz> so inset things dont have corners
[04:52:58] <arschmitz> why would you add the corner class?
[04:53:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. Exactly.
[04:53:09] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Sounds good.
[04:53:19] <arschmitz> but since these were options previously
[04:53:27] <arschmitz> we want to make sure we document the right way to do them now
[04:53:43] <arschmitz> not just say "do it with classes"
[04:53:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: In listview, inset never worked on the fly, only during _create(), so it wasn't truly an option.
[04:54:29] <arschmitz> it was documented as one
[04:54:31] <gabriel_schulhof> So for 1.5.0 we need only worry about it in create. We need not worry about synching the classes option during _setOptions()
[04:54:35] <arschmitz> its our own fault our widget is broken
[04:55:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes, but as a result if it continues to not work on-the-fly, i's not a regression, and since it's now deprecated, we should spend no effort making it work on-the-fly.
[04:55:26] <arschmitz> yes
[04:56:04] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. So I'll simply heed the value during _create(), updating the value of the appropriate class key in response, and that's it.
[04:56:25] <arschmitz> sounds good
[04:56:27] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and I'll do that in the new listview.backcompat.js
[04:56:37] <arschmitz> yup
[04:56:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Did I mention I love working on this project?
[04:56:51] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[04:57:14] <gabriel_schulhof> </gush>
[06:21:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I know we won't, but with the return of spans inside anchors, we might as well re-introduce some version of buttonMarkup ... I find myself having to write the same code in clearButton as in listview ...
[06:22:00] <arschmitz> why all it does is add a fixed piece of markup
[06:22:07] <arschmitz> its not like its reading data attributes
[06:24:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Neah, I don't want the autoinit portion back. I just want to create button markup consistently across the library. But anyway ... just noticing these things as I'm working on listview.
[06:25:00] <arschmitz> im not sure there is anything to create consistently?
[06:25:17] <arschmitz> the markup is totally different in textinput and listview
[06:26:32] <gabriel_schulhof> No, in both you have to create an anchor with a span for an icon. In the clearButton it's (X) and in listview it's (>)
[06:29:11] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and we have the back button, that's similar.
[06:29:51] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, with the arrival of UI's widgets, we'll have a lot fewer places where we do button markup, but we'll still have some,
[06:44:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the markup is so simple i dont see the value its like 2 lines to create it
[06:46:01] <arschmitz> and the markup is not the same, where in listview do we create an anchor? 
[06:46:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: also not sure how it would work since the widget it self needs to add all classes
