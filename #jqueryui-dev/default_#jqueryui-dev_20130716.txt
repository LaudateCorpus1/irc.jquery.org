[00:25:26] <libin> can someone please help with scroll top position on mobile device
[00:26:02] <libin> i am making a parallax website using stellar.js
[00:34:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's great! thanks!
[00:35:50] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper, I should be able to finish the core api docs work by the end of the week, and be back on mobile after that :-) I have completed 224 files. 85 to go!
[00:36:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: morning Anne
[00:36:15] <agcolom> Morning :-)
[00:36:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: wowww
[00:36:32] <agcolom> I over did it a bit this weekend! 
[00:37:02] <uGoMobi> :)
[00:37:41] <agcolom> but it will be good to have everything consistent... I'll have to get the mobile api docs done also.. but I enjoy doing that :-)
[00:37:47] <uGoMobi> when 1.4 alpha is out we have to focus on updating docs
[00:38:03] <uGoMobi> I love consistency :)
[00:38:12] <agcolom> yes, so we'll update the docs and worry about the consistency of the code after that.
[00:38:25] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[00:38:39] <agcolom> when is 1.4 alpha out?
[00:38:53] <uGoMobi> I also want to move text from demo center to API docs
[00:38:57] <uGoMobi> agcolom: this week
[00:39:05] <agcolom> right!
[00:39:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: so we are cranking on finishing development
[00:39:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: after that I will also finish reviewing the method signatures
[00:40:41] <agcolom> I have kids school events wednesday (short meeting, getting Alex's results), Thursday all evening and Friday is school disco and mums are going to the pub! so I probably won't be around much those evenings. 
[00:41:03] <agcolom> wednesday might still be ok... the meeting shouldn't be more than 30 mins.
[00:41:13] <uGoMobi> "moms are going to the pub"... sounds good :P
[00:41:22] <uGoMobi> lol
[00:42:04] <agcolom> yes ;-) shame we wait until the end of the year to do that ;-
[00:42:06] <agcolom> ;-)
[00:42:07] <uGoMobi> I also want to try to get new jquerymobile.com up when we release 1.4 final
[00:42:12] <uGoMobi> haha yeah
[00:42:24] <agcolom> that's a good idea... 
[00:43:06] <agcolom> I think Ralph must have started but I'm not sure how much he managed to get done. I get the feeling he's pretty busy also...
[00:43:44] <uGoMobi> I asked Ralph about the status in Portland and he thought all content was pretty much there but the homepage needed attention
[00:44:05] <agcolom> Oh and I'm getting a new internet connection on wednesday, so I hope the guy won't break it all!
[00:44:12] <agcolom> I can do homepage ;-)
[00:44:24] <uGoMobi> ohoh fingers crossed
[00:44:46] <agcolom> We're getting optical fiber connection I think!
[00:44:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you know if there is a stage site where i can view new homepage? or do I need to install wordpress local?
[00:45:14] <agcolom> I'll check...
[00:45:17] <uGoMobi> oh that's nice
[00:45:19] <agcolom> but I think it's local
[00:45:43] <agcolom> http://stage.jquerymobile.com/
[00:45:56] <uGoMobi> I have to install wordpress anyway, but want to do that on new mac
[00:45:58] <agcolom> oh yes, the homepage needs attention ;-)
[00:46:45] <uGoMobi> right
[00:47:49] <agcolom> but the content seems ok, so should be able to get that done on time for final. 
[00:48:43] <agcolom> Also, I think it'd be nice to list Firefox OS phones on the list of devices, since Mozilla donated a couple of them
[00:48:52] <uGoMobi> yeah, looks like blog posts dont' work though
[00:49:24] <uGoMobi> yup we need to update that list.
[00:49:37] <agcolom> no, I think the blog might be a different issue
[00:49:38] <uGoMobi> a couple of FF OS devices? thought we have one
[00:49:48] <agcolom> oh, ok, maybe one ;-)
[00:50:06] <agcolom> not sure... They are / it is?? at Filament
[00:50:27] <uGoMobi> Alex has it now
[00:50:32] <agcolom> oh great
[00:50:37] <agcolom> That's good
[00:50:44] <uGoMobi> so it's near Filament if Mozilla ever needs it back
[00:51:03] <agcolom> great!
[00:51:29] <agcolom> I doubt they will... but yes, it's nice to keep track!
[00:52:39] <agcolom> btw, the app we built at the university uses list views. I upgraded to 1.3.1 and OMG it's incredibly much faster!
[00:52:41] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but yeah, I agree we should be able to get new site up for 1.4 final
[00:52:56] <uGoMobi> agcolom: nice!
[00:53:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: wait until you upgrade to 1.4
[00:53:16] <agcolom> whoo!!!
[00:53:18] <uGoMobi> that would be even faster
[00:53:30] <agcolom> the difference is already crazy!
[00:54:29] <agcolom> ok, have to take alex to school now and then to work.... Speak soon :-)
[00:54:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, later
[00:54:52] <agcolom> btw is Ralph working on the homepage now?
[00:55:46] <agcolom> (Or should I start getting familiar with it?)
[00:56:22] <agcolom> also, should we revert the api site examples to using core 1.9.1 for 1.3? 
[00:56:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't think he is, but maybe better to check with him
[00:56:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah we should revert that
[00:57:07] <uGoMobi> agcolom: and update core in the 1.4 branch
[00:57:14] <agcolom> yes. 
[00:57:25] <agcolom> so which version in 1.4?
[00:57:49] <uGoMobi> 1.4: core 1.8-1.10 + 2.0 so I say 1.10.x
[00:58:05] <uGoMobi> 1.10.2 is latest I think
[00:58:26] <agcolom> ok. thanks :-)
[00:58:51] <agcolom> have a nice day :-) (it's crazy hot in London!)
[00:59:00] <uGoMobi> thanks, you too!
[00:59:07] <uGoMobi> same here.... finally summer
[00:59:15] <uGoMobi> :)
[00:59:17] <agcolom> but that;s a nice after such a long winter!
[00:59:20] <agcolom> yes :-)

[02:38:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[02:38:16] <uGoMobi> morning _|Nix|_ 
[02:38:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[02:38:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I need to split the class ui-popup-hidden into two classes: ui-popup-hidden and ui-popup-truncated
[02:39:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ui-popup-hidden keeps the position: absolute, the crazy top and left coordinates, and visibility: hidden, and the other class gets the width/height: 1px and the clipping.
[02:39:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I need to remove the trunctaion before calculating coordinates, but I need to keep it hidden before I can move it.
[02:39:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I remove truncated, calculate, and then remove hidden.
[02:40:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Otherwise, I've noticed that the page jumps by three pixels in Chrome 28: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/demos/widgets/popup and click on the FF logo (#transparent)
[02:42:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let me know if/when you've seen the jump so I can apply the fix and check if you can see a difference.
[02:42:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've only checked Chrome 28.0.1500.71 so far.
[02:42:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can't we change the ui-popup-hidden CSS so it works on all browsers with one class?
[02:43:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I noticed issue with the FF logo example before
[02:43:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I'm not actually sure why we've added the truncation. I can hardly imagine a popup that's > 10000px 
[02:43:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: setting height and width attr for the img resolved that if I am not mistaken
[02:43:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll do a git blame on the truncation.
[02:44:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no need
[02:44:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, it's happening on all popups. I just noticed.
[02:44:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I added it
[02:44:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, but do you remember why?
[02:44:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The git blame is less about the "who" and more about the "why".
[02:44:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I wanted a consistent accessibly hidden CSS
[02:44:58] <uGoMobi> and looked into various ways it is done
[02:44:59] <_|Nix|_> OK, but why the truncation?
[02:45:23] <_|Nix|_> BTW: It seems to be happening on all popups, not just the FF logo.
[02:45:38] <uGoMobi> I am trying to remember what was the benefit for that
[02:45:38] <_|Nix|_> Click the transition examples above.
[02:45:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: git blame can help.
[02:46:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think my commit message will only say consistent a11y CSS or something
[02:46:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep :)
[02:47:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and you've added the same kind of CSS to a lot of widgets.
[02:47:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know
[02:47:19] <uGoMobi> consistent, right :)
[02:47:32] <uGoMobi> but of course I don't want to introduce bugs
[02:47:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah :)
[02:47:53] <_|Nix|_> Well, I'm not sure if this was a bug before. I'm not sure when popups started jumping like that.
[02:47:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am looking into my resources again
[02:47:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[02:48:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, anyway, one possible solution is to break the class in two for popup, and the other is to not have the truncation at all.
[02:49:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not in favor of that
[02:49:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if the truncation is causing issues it's just not a good way to accessibly hide something
[02:50:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I thought the FF logo was causing a change in scrollTop because I intentionally placed it at the bottom of the document to make sure that showing a popup does not cause the document height to increase.
[02:50:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, if popups higher up, in the middle of the document cause the same behaviour then my calculation must not be it.
[02:51:53] <_|Nix|_> Interestingly though, popups towards the top of the page do not cause such behaviour.
[02:52:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Another question: If visibility: hidden is set, then does it really have to have crazy coordinates and truncated height?
[02:53:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: visibility: hidden; means it is not visible but still takes the space it would use if it was visible
[02:53:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so yes
[02:54:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can reproduce the issue with your test page on FF but not on Chrome
[02:54:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but position: absolute !important; visibility: hidden; should take care that no space is used.
[02:55:13] <_|Nix|_> Interesting. I've only reproduced it on Chrome - maybe it's because I have 3D transforms turned on.
[02:55:44] <_|Nix|_> Trying FF now ...
[02:55:55] <uGoMobi> 3d transforms are working for me too
[02:56:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but I had to force Chrome to turn them on.
[02:56:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: FF 22.0 works fine for me.
[02:57:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm, it looks like visibility hidden is bad practise
[02:57:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it can make the content inaccessible to screen readers
[02:57:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we added that later
[02:57:36] <_|Nix|_> Really?
[02:57:40] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[02:57:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: first I used it for panels
[02:57:55] <uGoMobi> because of tab issues
[02:58:02] <uGoMobi> and then you copied that to popup
[02:58:09] <uGoMobi> to replace other solution
[02:58:16] <uGoMobi> remember?
[02:58:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Vaguely ... 
[02:59:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, if it's bad practice, than what should we do?
[02:59:23] <_|Nix|_> Also, I can't remember how I accessed the Chrome setting for 3D transforms :/
[02:59:35] <uGoMobi> lol
[03:02:06] <_|Nix|_> Found it: chrome://flags
[03:02:21] <_|Nix|_> Now, if only I could find the right flag. I think I'll just reset to defaults.
[03:02:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: http://css-tricks.com/places-its-tempting-to-use-display-none-but-dont/
[03:04:09] <_|Nix|_> OK, so I reset everything to defaults, restarted chrome, and I still have 3D transforms. It must've started supporting them.
[03:04:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh that's nice
[03:04:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we don't need to use both methods to hide it the content
[03:05:04] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15pavans028 opened issue #6175: Flickering issue (Using jquery.mobile.1.2.1.min.js)  02http://git.io/EvtA6g
[03:05:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I also see we can remove the IE7 version of clip
[03:06:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right!
[03:06:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you mean "both methods"?
[03:07:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but looks like we have to use something other than visibility hidden 
[03:07:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I meant both techniques mentioned in that article
[03:09:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does the clipping approach result in a 0x0 rectangle?
[03:10:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, the clipping approach doesn't help me, because I think it will cause that three pixel jump to be retained.
[03:10:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I am looking at that now
[03:10:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's using 0 0 0 0 clip instead of 1px 1px 1px 1px
[03:11:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, so you would think that that'll result in a null rectangle.
[03:11:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Are we using 1x1 just for IE?
[03:11:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, just because that was common for this technique
[03:13:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will look into this today and change the CSS
[03:13:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[03:13:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you added visibility to fix an issue so I will look that ticket up and make sure we don't get a regression
[03:14:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[03:16:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll keep doing the controlgroup widget review. Thanks!
[03:16:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: awesome, thanks!
[03:17:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: BTW - are we still planning on $.mobile.formWidget ?
[03:18:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Dunno ... need to talk to arschmitz.
[03:18:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[03:18:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wait - I still have to do the unit test for tolerances.
[03:18:52] <_|Nix|_> ... for popup.

[04:27:01] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[04:27:16] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[04:27:21] <frequent> bonjour
[04:27:28] <frequent> I added the demo page just now. 
[04:27:35] <uGoMobi> goedemiddag
[04:27:44] <frequent> lol
[04:27:50] <uGoMobi> frequent: awesome!
[04:28:00] <frequent> ... and removed references to listview.filter extension from the demos
[04:28:17] <uGoMobi> nice
[04:28:21] <frequent> the only place I did not update was the backbone example, because it still uses an old version of JQM
[04:28:31] <frequent> some questions:
[04:28:34] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah, we need to change that
[04:29:03] <uGoMobi> (the backbone example that is)
[04:29:17] <frequent> data-enhanced still does not work, because the filter is using textinput and button, which still get enhanced
[04:29:21] <frequent> on my latest
[04:29:50] <uGoMobi> right, this is still in branches
[04:30:01] <uGoMobi> frequent: I will check that with arschmitz 
[04:30:03] <frequent> but will be added, so I can just uncomment later
[04:30:17] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[04:30:21] <frequent> cool
[04:30:25] <frequent> Another thing:
[04:31:40] <frequent> I'm using the filter widget with one of our plugins a lot, called jio, which allows to store, jquery and sync JSON documents across multiple storages. If you don't mind 3rd party plugins, I could add an example of using the filter to query localstorage + optional other storage (like S3)
[04:32:01] <frequent> to the advanced examples section
[04:33:02] <uGoMobi> frequent: interesting
[04:33:15] <frequent> it's really nice and open-source
[04:33:39] <frequent> I will just do the example and you can then check if you want to add it.
[04:34:53] <frequent> uGoMobi: last question:
[04:35:01] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok, personally I don't mind open source 3rd party plugin code in the demos as long as it is clear that it is 3rd party and the code should live inside the demos to prevent breakage
[04:35:16] <frequent> ok. np
[04:35:43] <frequent> last question: I will poke around the failing filter test, although I have no idea, why it's not passing.
[04:35:59] <uGoMobi> frequent: which test is that is failing?
[04:36:23] <frequent> Filter 22: Filtering Using Different Elements: Native Select:
[04:36:29] <frequent> filtering select options by option text
[04:37:09] <frequent> item.text() returns the <option> text allright on my local machine and all browsers I tested. But for some reason it's failing in Travis
[04:37:36] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok I'll give that a look
[04:37:48] <frequent> cool. thx
[04:37:50] <uGoMobi> frequent: re: 3rd party code in demos... I also have to check with others about this
[04:37:58] <frequent> np. just an idea
[04:38:08] <uGoMobi> thanks!

[05:40:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: you around?
[05:40:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am
[05:40:42] <uGoMobi> good morning
[05:41:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: morning
[05:41:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks for looking into SVG test
[05:41:12] <arschmitz> no problem
[05:41:26] <arschmitz> we need to completely disable in tests
[05:41:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[05:42:05] <arschmitz> not sure why it only causes a problem on that demo but its a known issue with qunit / phantom / data uri
[05:42:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: changing to getAttribute in mobile base widget is a breaking change
[05:42:50] <arschmitz> we did this just after 1.3
[05:43:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why's that?
[05:43:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: by using data / jqm data all values are converted to proper types
[05:43:33] <arschmitz> getAttribute they are just string
[05:44:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so before you could actually place a json object in a data attribute if you wanted and it would work
[05:44:13] <arschmitz> so for like the ui classes option
[05:44:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, because we're using $.mobile.getAttribute, which has a conditional similar to $.fn.attr()
[05:44:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: attr always fetches strings
[05:44:47] <arschmitz> data does conversion
[05:46:01] <arschmitz> When the data attribute is an object (starts with '{') or array (starts with '[') then jQuery.parseJSON is used to parse the string; it must follow valid JSON syntax including quoted property names. If the value isn't parseable as a JavaScript value, it is left as a string.
[05:46:01] <arschmitz> To retrieve the value's attribute as a string without any attempt to convert it, use the attr() method."
[05:46:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: from api.jquery.com/data
[05:46:31] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... OK ... I must've been thinking about $.fn.data, which converts when it first reads from the DOM.
[05:47:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Still, the point of _getCreateOptions is that it reads the options from the DOM the first time around.
[05:47:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Afterwards, they are managed by options, not by attributes.
[05:47:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes but that does not mean they should not be proper types
[05:47:45] <arschmitz> and they were proper types in 1.3
[05:48:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: They are proper types, because $.mobile.getAttribute converts - unlike $.fn.attr().
[05:48:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and just like $.fn.data().
[05:48:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Otherwise we'd have a ton of bugs with boolean attributes.
[05:48:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For example, if you have <div data-role="popup" data-corners="false"></div> it would still have corners.
[05:48:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you just explicitly check bool
[05:49:04] <arschmitz> you dont check numbers or objects or arrays
[05:49:17] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.data.js#L33
[05:49:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good point ... I guess I need to copy what $.fn.data does. I was kinda hoping to access that conversion so as to not duplicate the code, but it has been good enough so far.
[05:51:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js#L338
[05:52:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll copy that.
[05:52:15] <_|Nix|_> ... unfortunately. It'd be nice if that was exposed.

[06:02:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, i am confused too
[06:02:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: he changed his comment i think
[06:02:40] <arschmitz> ohh yup
[06:02:45] <arschmitz> i was looking at email
[06:03:06] <arschmitz> ok im closing then
[06:03:47] <uGoMobi> there was an update available for my lumia 520... will test again soon
[06:04:13] <arschmitz> hmm ill have to check mine
[06:04:36] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz closed issue #6073: Windows Phone 8 duplicating buttons  02http://git.io/dssP8Q
[06:06:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure if that guy was a reliable source. The OP posted this screen shots from "next" https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6073#issuecomment-19010785
[06:06:24] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6073 by Rhym (1mon 1w ago): Windows Phone 8 duplicating buttons
[06:06:59] <uGoMobi> i can't think of anything that could have fixed that after merging next in master
[06:07:35] <uGoMobi> well, we can always reopen
[06:07:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah but hes clearly either no longer experiencing the problem or not caring and that person says they were testing on both a 920 and an 8x
[06:07:49] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[06:08:51] <agcolom> uGoMobi: so I've replaced all the core 1.10.0 to 1.9.1 and will tag and push when I get home (just can't remember the command to do it)
[06:09:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think the guy that commented today didn't test the form disabled page, but we can test this on own devices soon I guess
[06:09:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom: great, thanks!
[06:10:00] <arschmitz> yup will have both devices soon
[06:10:44] <uGoMobi> late lunch... brb
[06:13:39] <FrEaKmAn_> hi all
[06:19:13] <_|Nix|_> FrEaKmAn_: Hi!
[06:19:38] <FrEaKmAn_> I have one question regarding jqm with phonegap
[06:19:52] <FrEaKmAn_> for which size should I create static images?
[06:20:03] <FrEaKmAn_> 320x480, 480x800?
[06:21:11] <arschmitz> FrEaKmAn_: thats really a question for #jquery this is the developers channel but there is no realy right answer for that
[06:21:26] <arschmitz> it depends on your app and what devices you support
[06:34:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird ... Warning: PhantomJS unable to load "http://localhost:9694/tests/integration/navigation/sequence/sequence-push-state-disabled-dialog-hash-key-tests.html" URI. Use --force to continue.
[06:34:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah?
[06:34:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Locally ...
[06:34:35] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:34:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Was that the error you were seeing?
[06:34:56] <arschmitz> yeah i already fixed it i just have not pushed yet
[06:35:08] <arschmitz> its from the inlineSVG support test
[06:35:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK. 
[06:35:26] <arschmitz> phantom + qunit + data uri = BROKEN!
[06:35:37] <arschmitz> its a known issue
[06:35:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Understood.
[06:36:00] <arschmitz> so im just setting $.support.inlineSVG = $.noop;
[06:36:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in the tests
[06:36:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[06:36:50] <arschmitz> yeah apparently phantom does not work with data uris
[06:37:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im pushing in just a sec 
[06:38:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. great! I have one failure resulting from the change in $.mobile.getAttribute ... I'll have to fix it.
[06:53:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont trust this guy on WP8 issue at all any more lol
[06:55:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: lol
[06:56:01] <uGoMobi> did you see that question? "how do we call this bug?"
[06:56:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I tested on lumia 520 again and still don't see it
[06:57:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no i missed that one
[06:57:09] <arschmitz> yeah i still dont see anything either
[06:57:14] <arschmitz> and he says its perfect on 8x
[06:57:42] <arschmitz> and that jqm does not work at all on 920 like its c grad or something
[06:57:43] <uGoMobi> we can ask kborchers 
[06:58:26] <arschmitz> yeah execpt he has 8x one they claim it works on lol
[06:58:40] <uGoMobi> ah right
[06:58:48] <uGoMobi> we need lumia 920 for this
[06:58:50] <uGoMobi> pfff
[06:59:01] <arschmitz> yup well one will be on its way

[07:08:52] <uGoMobi> kborchers: yeah, that doesn't seem to be any issue anymore
[07:09:07] <uGoMobi> it's only on lumia 920 now :/
[07:09:16] <kborchers> that seems … unlikely
[07:09:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its not even same issue on 920
[07:09:28] <arschmitz> he claims that jqm does not work AT ALL on 920
[07:09:30] <uGoMobi> right
[07:09:53] <kborchers> i have doubts … did anyone ask if he tried turning off and on again?
[07:10:06] <arschmitz> im quite skeptical about that since he said it work 2 hours ago
[07:10:07] <kborchers> ;)
[07:10:21] <arschmitz> and we have 2 520's which are very similar and it works fine

[07:43:04] <frequent> he has
[07:43:08] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:43:19] <frequent> deja-vu
[07:43:20] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I should do a /who more often :) Hey!
[07:43:38] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hey
[07:43:43] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Cool! Lemme have a look at it then ...
[07:44:08] <frequent> I added the refresh method, tests and cleaned up the code a little. Some stuff is still missing. See the PR
[07:44:18] <frequent> Time is a constraint...
[07:45:15] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Right. I think the refresh method is all we can do, so that's great!
[07:45:22] <frequent> cool.
[07:49:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: clear button issue is gone already
[07:51:09] <uGoMobi> must have that var that was causing it
[07:51:20] <uGoMobi> s/have/have been/
[07:51:20] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Wow! You did the "enhance" option as well?
[07:51:28] <frequent> yup
[07:51:41] <uGoMobi> yeah, we owe frequent like 100 beers
[07:52:02] <frequent> a currency I can live with...
[07:52:07] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:52:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no much more insidious cause
[07:53:07] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a947937418cebf229d9d83e297c8900bc29f4190#L0L84
[07:53:08] <b-ot> arschmitz: Alexander Schmitz (20m 36s ago): Textinput: Fix Variable name
[07:54:46] <uGoMobi> hmm how did that semi-colon end up there
[07:54:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not sure
[07:54:56] <arschmitz> but it was the real cause
[07:56:14] <uGoMobi> was more talking to myself, because I am sure I am responsible ;)
[07:56:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nope
[07:56:28] <arschmitz> might be your change but i manually applied it
[07:56:43] <uGoMobi> anyways... it's fixed :)
[07:56:47] <arschmitz> yup
[07:56:52] <uGoMobi> case closed
[07:57:39] <arschmitz> and tests are GREEN again that failure took me most of last night to track down
[07:58:32] <uGoMobi> yeah nice find
[07:58:38] <arschmitz> figured out it was the svg test quickly but then figuring out what about the test and how to make it work in phantom was hard
[07:59:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on bright side fixing it forced me to move running the test to init
[07:59:20] <uGoMobi> yes, good solution BTW
[07:59:39] <uGoMobi> I was only thinking about extend $.support and have it return true/false
[08:00:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah could do that as well 
[08:00:28] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I'm not sure about this referenceClass approach to snag the menu ... we should go with the id-based approach. The id for the popup is based on the id for the table, so we should use the id for the popup to identify the popup when looking up pre-rendered elements.
[08:00:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: well that didn't work
[08:00:45] <uGoMobi> because it was undefined
[08:00:51] <arschmitz> oh 
[08:01:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you made it return the function, right?
[08:01:05] <arschmitz> yes
[08:01:16] <_|Nix|_> frequent: When enhancing ourselves, we either use an existing ID or we generate one based on uniqueid ...
[08:01:17] <uGoMobi> that resolved the timing issue
[08:01:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh right because of the onload
[08:01:50] <uGoMobi> exactly
[08:02:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also i needed it to return the funtion so i could set it to $.noop
[08:02:11] <arschmitz> to have it not run in tests
[08:02:45] <uGoMobi> yeah, so it resolves two issues.. I like that  kind of fixes :)
[08:02:54] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok. I was wondering if/what to use when a widget is pre-enhanced and has elements that are not directly accessible as children
[08:03:10] <frequent> like the togglepopup, which will be somewhere "before" the table 
[08:03:36] <frequent> so if the user provides this pre-enhanced, I'm not sure how to select when setting up the widget
[08:04:00] <frequent> select it
[08:04:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: made me remeber the URL hide option too
[08:04:05] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah, for sure. Popup is the same way. The original element is torn out of the page and placed in a wrapper at the bottom of the page.
[08:04:14] <frequent> yup
[08:04:18] <_|Nix|_> frequent: So, there's no overall container for all the elements associated with the widget.
[08:04:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: because its in same area of init
[08:04:33] <_|Nix|_> frequent: So, the only thing we can go on without adding additional data-* attributes is ID.
[08:04:41] <frequent> correct. and then JQM needs some pointer where it is
[08:04:43] <frequent> yup
[08:04:49] <frequent> I thought about data-target
[08:04:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right
[08:05:06] <frequent> which the user could provide to either append an element somewhere specific or...
[08:05:13] <frequent> in the case of pre-enhanced markup, u
[08:05:24] <frequent> use as pointer to where ever an element is
[08:05:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if we move ui-noboxshadow from support to init we can close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6168
[08:05:47] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6168 by uGoMobi (1d 5h ago): Move adding of no-support classes from support.js to init.js
[08:06:06] <_|Nix|_> frequent: We're already doing this in the demos: <div data-demo-html="#id-of-demo-snippet">...</div>
[08:06:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i noticed that that test was similar and working same way also
[08:07:03] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#497 (master - a947937 : Alexander Schmitz): The build was broken.

[08:08:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: ahh back to good ol random failures
[08:08:09] <frequent> _|Nix|_: yup. I saw that. And I like the idea.
[08:09:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Tell me about it ... I've been trying to get my controlgroup PR to pass for the past hour :/
[08:11:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : we have to do something about this
[08:11:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: about all we can do is try increasing the timeouts
[08:11:34] <arschmitz> and hope that works
[08:11:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: problem is it fails on any one of like 15 different tests
[08:11:58] <uGoMobi> can we move the random failing tests so travis doesn't run them, but we can run them local? until we found a solution
[08:12:11] <uGoMobi> right
[08:12:23] <uGoMobi> so it's basically about all nav tests
[08:12:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we would have to pull like have to remove like half the nav test modules
[08:12:29] <arschmitz> yes
[08:12:37] <uGoMobi> :(
[08:12:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im like 90% sure i know the cause
[08:13:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and i can fix but it will make tests take longer to run
[08:13:24] <uGoMobi> I don't have a problem with that
[08:14:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: my plan is to start incresing a little at a time until failures stop happening
[08:14:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sounds good
[08:24:22] <frequent> uGoMobi: has anyone done any tests on the fastest way to select an element by "data-foo"?
[08:25:41] <frequent> just wondering
[08:26:24] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I don't think there are too many ways.
[08:27:05] <_|Nix|_> frequent: The only one I can think of is $( "[data-" + $.mobile.ns + "foo]" );
[08:27:45] <frequent> yup. that's what I'm using. Was thinking about QSA, but support...
[08:28:06] <frequent> ok. no magic potion...
[08:32:49] <_|Nix|_> OK, another instance where we use signals instead of methods: table refresh ... *shake head* ...
[08:34:25] <frequent> ?
[08:35:25] <_|Nix|_> frequent: table.js triggers the signal named "refresh" if the parameter "create" is not set, and both columntoggle and reflow bind to that.
[08:36:15] <_|Nix|_> frequent: That's bad. The correct solution is for all three to implement refresh() and for the two extensions to use _super() first.
[08:36:23] <frequent> I see
[08:37:06] <frequent> but one problem I had was that methods were overwritten
[08:37:21] <_|Nix|_> frequent: So, in coltoggle: refresh: function( create ) { this._super( create ); if ( create ) { return }; /* the rest of _colToggleRefresh */ }
[08:37:35] <frequent> hm.
[08:37:39] <_|Nix|_> frequent: They are overwritten, but the original method is available via this._super()
[08:37:58] <frequent> ok. I can update tonight.
[08:38:06] <_|Nix|_> frequent: So, if you want to run table's refresh() first, you call this._super( create );
[08:38:20] <_|Nix|_> frequent: NP. I'm doing it. I've pulled your PR into a branch and I'm updating it.
[08:38:42] <frequent> ok. thx. next time I know.
[08:39:20] <_|Nix|_> frequent: NP. I'll push the branch and then we'll all look at it. If anything is missing, you can do a PR against it, or I can make the mods.
[08:39:28] <frequent> (worries about his 100beers...)
[08:39:30] <frequent> ok
[08:39:43] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Don't worry. You've already earned those, I'd say :)
[08:39:54] <frequent> (exhales)
[08:45:18] <_|Nix|_> OK ... these random failures are killing me! I'm restarting two of the jobs for the third time!
[08:45:28] <_|Nix|_> Pass already, will ya?!

[12:46:48] <arschmitz> i doubled it from 2 seconds to 4
[12:47:16] <arschmitz> see A) if it solves the problem. and B) how much overall time difference this makes
[12:48:40] <arschmitz> but honestly 2 seconds to request load and enhance and render a page on an overloaded machine does seem like not a lot of time
