[02:04:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: With UI's selectmenu it's really easy to implement an option to produce the native menu instead: With https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/jquery-ui/compare/native-selectmenu/ you can get http://jsbin.com/kuguza/1/ ... 
[02:44:32] <fnagel> Hey guys, do we have a wiki page or a learning article regarding RTL support? Or any general ressources on this topic?
[03:18:45] <gabriel_schulhof> fnagel: Not much, AFAIK. In fact, Ariya Hidayat pointed out to us that we should take RTL more seriously.
[03:23:03] <fnagel> gabriel_schulhof: yeah, I noticed there was ungoing discussion regarding this topic. That's why I wanted to dig into this a little so I'm aware of what issues we are facing.
[03:23:32] <fnagel> gabriel_schulhof: Should be helpful for calendar / datepicker too.
[03:38:48] <gabriel_schulhof> No doubt.
[05:28:22] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I'm out for lunch, will continue button review afterwards. Just to make sure you're not getting nervous ;)
[05:28:38] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: lol
[05:28:39] <arschmitz> cool
[05:28:54] <arschmitz> I already fixed that radio group thing if you can loop back on it when you get a sec

[05:58:58] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: you should run grunt more often
[05:59:10] <arschmitz> i always run grunt test out of habit
[05:59:17] <arschmitz> because on mobile that runs everything
[05:59:18] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: maybe you need to npm-install? I get plenty of errors from jscs
[05:59:41] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its because jshint and jscs dont run on grunt test in ui
[05:59:50] <arschmitz> drives me nuts
[05:59:51] <jzaefferer> or that
[05:59:55] <jzaefferer> fix it!
[06:00:03] <arschmitz> i figured it was intentional
[06:00:09] <arschmitz> if its not ill fix it
[06:00:15] <jzaefferer> I doubt it
[06:00:24] <jzaefferer> I just run `grunt`
[06:00:41] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: is there a reason jshint and jscs should not run on grunt test?
[06:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> Because they're not tests?
[06:01:15] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: Yeah i try to remember to when im working on ui its just habit to type grunt test
[06:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> `grunt test` should run unit tests, which should include JSHint.
[06:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> But it won't run the lint task(s)
[06:01:59] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: you could also go for `npm test`, that will run `grunt`
[06:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, but JSHint tests don't run because phantom is a piece of shit browser.
[06:02:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yup
[06:02:19] <arschmitz> so it just skips it entirely 
[06:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> I don't actually use `grunt test` very often. I run tests in Chrome during dev.
[06:03:32] <arschmitz> I mean its my own issue i should just run grunt not grunt test its just habbit from working on mobile
[06:04:16] <arschmitz> grunt has never run the tests on mobile
[06:05:37] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: but if you would be open to adding it to grunt test i would certainly be happy to do a PR
[06:07:24] <jzaefferer> fine by me
[06:07:50] <jzaefferer> Travis relies on `npm test`
[06:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really care either way.
[06:08:41] <scott_gonzalez> If you're changing it, make the default just run test.
[06:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> And have test run lint and qunit
[06:08:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: will do
[06:08:56] <jzaefferer> Jenkins runs `grunt` and `grunt concat`
[06:40:57] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: you should also integrate the linting tools into your editor. Shortens the feedback loop a lot
[06:41:16] <arschmitz> They are
[06:41:34] <jzaefferer> Well, how do you miss all the jscs errors then?
[06:41:38] <arschmitz> there was only 1 lint issue and i just didnt notice it
[06:41:42] <arschmitz> jscs is not in my editor
[06:41:52] <jzaefferer> well, then get that into your editor :-)
[06:42:13] <arschmitz> I thought i did like a month ago actually
[06:42:26] <arschmitz> when i was discussing editors with someone but if i did its never worked lol
[06:47:15] <jzaefferer> are you using sublime text 3?
[06:47:58] <jzaefferer> SublimeLinter sometimes stops working entirely for me, reinstall helps
[06:48:03] <arschmitz> interesting you mention
[06:48:14] <arschmitz> i switched at same time but am some how using 2 again lol
[06:48:17] <arschmitz> and didnt even notice
[06:48:27] <arschmitz> ( have both installed )
[06:48:36] <jzaefferer> maybe that's the problem
[06:48:44] <arschmitz> could be
[06:49:21] <arschmitz> ill have to check it out because i had specifically wanted jscs in it

[08:06:21] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: back. Was hoping scott_gonzalez would comment on the class assertion issue, that will have to wait a bit longer then
[08:06:44] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I can very much relate to how you don't want to update everything again...
[08:31:45] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez is getting a tattoo and meeting with Ianmaffet at intel so probably wont hear from him until afternoon
[08:32:30] <jzaefferer> okay, unless he now just agrees with me, we'll have to discuss that further tomorrow then
[08:46:59] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: if my comments don't make sense, check the original on GitHub, I'm fixing typos when I notice them, but that won't make into the email notifications
[08:47:13] <jzaefferer> Like "whole while", turned into "whole file"
[08:47:17] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sure
[08:51:36] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: this is quite exhausting :/ please excuse any snarkyness or inpolite briefness. You're doing great work that deserves lots of attention to detail to get it done properly...
[08:51:54] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: No worries 
[08:52:02] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: we work with scott remember
[08:52:07] <arschmitz> :-p
[08:52:45] <jzaefferer> Well, make sure he doesn't see your attempt at deleting a DOM element :p 
[08:52:52] <jzaefferer> (or whatever that is)
[08:53:02] <arschmitz> Thats weird i honestly have no idea what the deal there is
[08:54:05] <jzaefferer> it seems like you wrote it, wasn't there before
[08:54:29] <arschmitz> yeah i know i looked but i have no idea whiy if im trying to remove i would not .remove()
[08:54:33] <jzaefferer> source does "delete this.icon;", after removing the DOM element, maybe you mistook that?
[08:54:52] <arschmitz> i can probably count on one hand the number of times i actualy even used delete lol
[08:55:22] <jzaefferer> (Conversation 86)
[08:55:36] <jzaefferer> And I barely commented on any of the ui/ files...
[08:56:00] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: oh ok i see whats up there and its not trying to remove the dom element
[08:56:07] <arschmitz> but its still not doing what it should
[08:56:18] <arschmitz> i should be deleting the refrence off the widget
[08:56:23] <arschmitz> and removing it
[08:56:28] <arschmitz> to make sure its recreated
[08:56:50] <jzaefferer> I think it should only remove the DOM element
[08:57:00] <jzaefferer> no user would ever explicitly delete the instance property
[08:57:09] <jzaefferer> while messing up the DOM seems quite likely
[08:57:27] <arschmitz> Hmm im not even so sure the widget would handle that case
[08:57:33] <arschmitz> it checks that this.icon is defined
[08:57:41] <arschmitz> hence the reason for the delete in the actual widget
[08:58:04] <jzaefferer> Well, if we support messing up the DOM, we should do it properly
[08:58:16] <arschmitz> do we support that?
[08:58:20] <jzaefferer> I think in the widget it mostly removes the property to know that there is no icon
[08:58:26] <jzaefferer> i don't know
[08:58:35] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: thats correct
[08:58:39] <jzaefferer> I don't think we should
[08:58:43] <arschmitz> i dont either
[08:58:49] <jzaefferer> Can't think of any instance where we do that
[08:58:51] <arschmitz> its an endless whole
[08:58:55] <arschmitz> hole
[08:59:17] <jzaefferer> endless whole sounds like a paradox
[08:59:30] <jzaefferer> or just more infinity?
[08:59:41] <arschmitz> lol
[08:59:44] <jzaefferer> anyway, let's not support that and fix the test accordingly
[08:59:57] <arschmitz> yup
[09:00:46] <arschmitz> so in the terms of the widget i think we should remove the instance prop and the element and check both are recreated?
[09:01:27] <jzaefferer> I still don't understand why we should check that
[09:01:36] <jzaefferer> When turning off the icon it should remove it
[09:01:43] <arschmitz> yes
[09:01:55] <jzaefferer> Why should refresh bother with the icon at all?
[09:02:11] <arschmitz> because it could change
[09:02:34] <arschmitz> based on if someone changed the checked state with js
[09:02:51] <jzaefferer> Well, we should test that then
[09:02:52] <arschmitz> which is also the time people are most likely to be calling refresh
[09:03:26] <jzaefferer> Which you already do, so just add assertions for the icon
[09:03:38] <arschmitz> ok
[09:05:33] <jzaefferer> I posted a summary on the PR
[09:05:39] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1415/files#r22664581
[09:06:00] <arschmitz> looks good thank you
[09:07:24] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: Hey speaking of domEqual has there been any thought put into trying to make the diff not so insane?
[09:09:17] <jzaefferer> Well, there are a bunch of open issues on QUnit to improve diffs
[09:09:37] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adiff
[09:09:47] <jzaefferer> This should help for domEqual, I think: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/363
[09:10:43] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yup that sounds perfect
[09:11:37] <jzaefferer> I have to put this on hold again, will continue later or, more likely, tomorrow
[09:11:50] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sounds good thank you

[12:22:16] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yes for sure that what i said yesterday
[12:22:28] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i was just posting it for refrence
[12:23:03] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: might be worth pinging the guy that made the mobile implementation though he admits its the first time hes done RTL implementation
[12:27:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Is 5 PM your time OK with you?
[12:27:11] <arschmitz> today?
[12:27:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes.
[12:27:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im not actually sure
[12:27:28] <arschmitz> why dont we do it anohter day
[12:27:54] <arschmitz> its not urgent but iv been having some nav discussions and we are going to have to diverge from the plan in a pretty substantial way
[12:28:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. How's tomorrow?
[12:28:47] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: sure
[12:28:49] <gabriel_schulhof> I have an appointment between 6:30 AM and 8:00 AM your time.
[12:29:02] <arschmitz> i should be around basicly all day
[12:29:04] <gabriel_schulhof> No, wait, sorry. Wrong times.
[12:29:22] <gabriel_schulhof> No, they were right.
[12:29:26] <arschmitz> lol
[12:29:36] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so I'll talk to you around 9-ish?
[12:30:08] <arschmitz> sounds good
[12:30:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Sweet!
[12:34:02] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: for a little perspective on the scope of those 2 prs i added up the diff stats from the 2 prs
[12:34:19] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: ~5000 changed lines across 110 files
[12:34:38] <arschmitz> ( there are dups in those between pr's of course )
[12:34:39] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: regarding "Ok will switch everything back in this and the classes PR" - as Scott and I said, we don't need to change every class-related assertion. The one I commented on for button are definitely worth changing
[12:34:56] <arschmitz> right i just meant everything that made snese sorry
[12:36:24] <jzaefferer> heh, okay
[12:36:29] <jzaefferer> ah yes, its a ton of changes
[12:36:50] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: so is there a reason we dont run jscs on /tests/*
[12:36:56] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: we do jshint but not jscs
[12:37:03] <jzaefferer> yeah, its a mess
[12:37:07] <arschmitz> ah ok
[12:37:22] <jzaefferer> was hoping for esformatter to do an initial round of fixes
[12:37:30] <jzaefferer> that never happened
[12:37:31] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: was just noticing many of the things in there would have been caught by it
[12:37:37] <jzaefferer> yeah
[12:37:54] <jzaefferer> I can try to hack it to deal with the weird indentation rules we have, just for the tests
[12:38:11] <jzaefferer> I think they are less inconsistent than other files, e.g. the UMD wrappers are ridicolous...
[12:38:40] <arschmitz> yeah makes sense
[12:39:03] <arschmitz> would be nice to run it on all the js files
[12:39:41] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: id run jshint on the script tags in html files if i could
