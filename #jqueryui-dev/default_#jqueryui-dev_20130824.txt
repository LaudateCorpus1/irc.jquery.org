[01:03:20] <uGoMobi> just realize branches are also directly under view.jquerymobile.com, so I guess we have to add an allow rule to robots.txt for every stable release :/

[02:17:53] <gnarf> uGoMobi: view.* shouldn't be used as a permanent hosting solution?
[02:21:42] <uGoMobi> gnarf: I suppose there was a reason that we switched to view.* also for the demos of our releases
[02:23:55] <uGoMobi> but might be better to have those on jquerymobile.com/demos/ again
[02:24:13] <gnarf> why do you need old version demos in the google juice?
[02:24:15] <uGoMobi> maybe it had to do with all our PHP stuff in there
[02:24:23] <gnarf> and also why can't you link to it from the website?
[02:24:30] <gnarf> "Previous version demos ------"
[02:25:06] <uGoMobi> we don't need the old demos on Google, it's just that latest demos aren't on Google now
[02:25:24] <uGoMobi> yes, that's what we going to do
