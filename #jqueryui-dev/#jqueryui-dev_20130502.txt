[06:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: We need a download builder release for the IM version fix.
[06:56:50] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it's safe to do a release, right?
[06:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> That change is the only commit since the last release.
[06:57:11] <rxaviers> yeap
[06:57:31] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll do a release.
[06:57:46] <rxaviers> ok or just let me know if you want me to...
[06:58:50] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...have you not been using `npm version`?
[06:59:27] <rxaviers> I do it manually
[06:59:28] <rxaviers> :)

[07:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I have broken images again :-(
[07:19:54] <rxaviers> af really
[07:20:00] <rxaviers> what's your IM v?
[07:20:05] <scott_gonzalez> Version: ImageMagick 6.8.0-7 2013-02-15 Q16 http://www.imagemagick.org
[07:22:44] <rxaviers> can I download the images you generated?
[07:25:18] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/3S0U1z1u2E0V
[07:25:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's the redmond image reference in http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9090
[07:37:10] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I might be doing this release from the staging server again.
[08:03:05] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, trouble is that I could not reproduce the issue locally (w/ ImageMagick 6.8.3-9). Could you try running two commands on your term?
[08:03:26] <rxaviers> (I'd like to check if colorspace also fixes it)
[08:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[08:03:41] <rxaviers> on DB path, 1st run:
[08:03:52] <rxaviers> convert -size 40x100 'xc:#aaaaaa' template/themeroller/texture/flat.png -compose dissolve -define compose:args=0,100 -composite output.buggy.png
[08:03:58] <rxaviers> this should be the white one
[08:04:24] <rxaviers> convert -size 40x100 -set colorspace RGB 'xc:#aaaaaa' template/themeroller/texture/flat.png -compose dissolve -define compose:args=0,100 -composite -set colorspace sRGB output.try.png
[08:04:33] <rxaviers> this hopefully fixes it
[08:06:19] <rxaviers> What did you get?
[08:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> both white
[08:07:57] <rxaviers> af
[08:08:34] <rxaviers> thks will research about it
[08:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[08:08:57] <rxaviers> i will open an issue so we keep track of it

[12:29:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: DaveMethvin can you confirm that http://www.w3.org/Submission/pointer-events/#the-pointermove-event is telling me that pointerdown and pointerup should always trigger a pointermove as well?
[12:29:38] <kborchers> since they are changing button state?
[12:30:24] <DaveMethvin> checking and thinking...
[12:30:31] <DaveMethvin> the thinking takes longer
[12:30:34] <kborchers> :)
[12:31:20] <DaveMethvin> kborchers it's a good question, i'm not sure
[12:31:33] <DaveMethvin> because pointerdown fires when the button changes
[12:31:39] <kborchers> right
[12:31:43] <kborchers> seems odd to me
[12:32:16] <DaveMethvin> it might be hard to detect NOT getting one
[12:32:25] <DaveMethvin> since pointermove also fires due to pressure change
[12:32:30] <DaveMethvin> if it's supported
[12:32:51] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: the pointermove tests in your repo test for a pointermove after pointerdown (but not after pointerup) which is what brought this to my attention
[12:33:28] <DaveMethvin> is that in relation to the pointercancel test tho?
[12:33:40] <kborchers> nope ‚Ä¶ pointermove.html
[12:33:46] <DaveMethvin> lemme look
[12:34:21] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/dmethvin/pointerevents-test/blob/master/pointermove.html#L133
[12:34:24] <DaveMethvin> oh what a mess ... no wonder i've been putting off the cleanup
[12:34:28] <kborchers> :D
[12:34:30] <kborchers> yeah
[12:34:49] <DaveMethvin> should have quoted the spec section that implied that
[12:35:04] <kborchers> i'm guessing it's the one i pointed out
[12:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> No, that's not what it's saying.
[12:35:41] <scott_gonzalez> Also, don't read that.
[12:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> That's not the spec.
[12:36:38] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Use https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerevents/raw-file/tip/pointerEvents.html for reference.
[12:36:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ah, thank you
[12:37:03] <scott_gonzalez> I can bring this up for clarification though.
[12:37:36] <kborchers> thanks scott_gonzalez
[12:38:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's not clear to me whether it would always fire a pointermove or not
[12:38:25] <DaveMethvin> the button change is what triggered the pointerdown
[12:39:00] <DaveMethvin> but they could also just be implying that a button change after that such as an *additional* button won't fire another pointerdown (instead just a pointermove)
[12:39:16] <DaveMethvin> which is the whole chorded buttons thing
[12:40:22] <kborchers> hmm, how would that work? an additional touch wouldn't fire pointerdown? only the first?
[12:40:39] <DaveMethvin> another touch, yes
[12:40:46] <DaveMethvin> but not a second button on the first pointer
[12:40:52] <DaveMethvin> like two mouse buttons
[12:41:26] <kborchers> or a button on a pen after it's already touching?
[12:41:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah, prob
[12:41:40] <DaveMethvin> s/chorded/ in the docs
[12:42:22] <kborchers> ok, i think that would make sense but that section of the spec doesn't read that way IMO
[12:42:37] <kborchers> and apparently in the opinion of the person who wrote that test as well :)
[12:42:53] <DaveMethvin> i would tend to agree that the spec is saying if a button changes you get a pointermove
[12:43:28] <DaveMethvin> which would imply you always get pointerover+pointerdown+pointermove
[12:43:58] <kborchers> right
[12:44:04] <kborchers> ok, i'm going to ignore that test for now until scott_gonzalez can maybe get some clarification
[12:44:20] <DaveMethvin> i can try a test with the ms implementation but it's pretty hard to tell if you have managed to put the pointer down without absolutely any change to the other params that might cause a pointermove
[12:44:25] <kborchers> right now i'm only doing pointerover+pointerdown
[12:44:34] <kborchers> or pointerup+pointerout
[12:44:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah and then the question is, would you fire that last pointermove before the pointerup?
[12:44:57] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: yeah, that would be really hard
[12:45:49] <kborchers> i would think so but ¬Ø\(¬∞_o)/¬Ø
[12:47:59] <DaveMethvin> kborchers what is the value of the buttons for the pointerover that happens before the pointerdown? I guess it shows no buttons even though you're probably firing it in response to a pointerdown and know a button is being pressed?
[12:48:59] <DaveMethvin> no that would tend to lose valuable info
[12:49:26] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: i would have to check
[12:49:28] <DaveMethvin> it just seems strange to fire over before down but give away the punch line
[12:49:44] <DaveMethvin> i didn't see it in the spec
[12:50:48] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: yeah, not sure 
[12:51:20] <kborchers> in my impl, i am passing the "down" event to create the pointerover so buttons would probably end up being 1
[12:51:28] <kborchers> that could be wrong
[12:51:32] <kborchers> just what it's doing now
