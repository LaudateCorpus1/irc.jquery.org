[05:45:57] <lx-berlin_> Does anyone know if there is a way to make the movement of jquerui draggable more smoothly ? If you move the element slowly, it looks ok. But if you make fast mouse movements, it looks really uneven.
[06:04:21] <scott_gonzalez> lx-berlin_: Support is in #jquery.
[06:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> Do people think we should handle changing `appendTo` while a dialog is open?
[06:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> I remember having a discussion about options that only work during certain phases of a life cycle.
[06:20:07] <scott_gonzalez> Like some options that only work on init.
[06:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, menu's `menus` option is one of them: http://api.jqueryui.com/menu/#option-menus
[06:20:53] <kborchers> i can't think of a use case where i would change appendTo after the dialog is open
[06:21:09] <scott_gonzalez> I also think we shouldn't support changing autocomplete appendTo while the menu is shown.
[06:21:19] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Right, these things just don't make sense.
[06:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'll probably end up closing on his next reply.
[06:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> Unless someone thinks there's a reason to do this.
[06:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> I loved his response though.
[06:22:26] <scott_gonzalez> "Why are you doing this?" "It doesn't matter! I have a complex app!!!"
[06:22:33] <tj_vantoll> :)
[06:22:35] <tj_vantoll> Probably worth adding a note on the docs like menu's though.
[06:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Yeah
[06:22:48] <scott_gonzalez> As soon as this ticket is closed, we can add it.
[06:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> That'll be my closing comment :-)
[06:32:37] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez http://api.jqueryui.com/menu/#option-menus Unfortunately right after the note the code example still shows the setter.
[06:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, we can remove those.
[06:33:31] <scott_gonzalez> At least, I know we can do it for all methods.
[06:33:41] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember if I wrote code to remove it from a single method.
[06:33:47] <scott_gonzalez> But we can definitely get this to work.
[06:34:14] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, probably worth creating a means of doing that if there isn't already.
[06:35:07] <tj_vantoll> fyi menu's role option also cannot be changed after initialization.
[06:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm going to just do a search in all the entries to see if there are more.
[06:40:40] <scott_gonzalez> So removing @example-value from <option> makes the examples go away.
[06:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> But we'll still want the other 2 examples.
[06:42:30] <tj_vantoll> set-after-init="false" ? It could spit out the warning as well.
[06:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> We'd need to pass a custom message though.
[06:45:26] <scott_gonzalez> The second sentence "Existing submenus will not be updated." is option-specific.
[06:45:32] <tj_vantoll> Ugh, yeah.
[06:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> I could add the set-after-init flag for the examples though.
[06:46:27] <scott_gonzalez> And just keep the note in the option.
[06:47:34] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, I can't think of a better approach.
[06:58:01] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: http://cl.ly/image/3513201u051I
[06:58:30] <tj_vantoll> Text is still wrong.
[06:58:37] <tj_vantoll> "Set the menu option, after initialization:"
[06:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> Oops. That's actually different text.
[06:59:16] <scott_gonzalez> I just wrote the wrong word :-P
[06:59:31] <tj_vantoll> :)
[06:59:42] <tj_vantoll> Rest looks good. I like the warning styling.
[06:59:50] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/2G0Z0p1O2m0o
[07:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> I also wrapped the option name in <code>.
[07:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> So that'll affect all options.
[07:00:39] <tj_vantoll> *thumbs up*
[07:00:55] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm going to search for other options.
[07:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> Just those two menu options.
[07:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-appendTo
[07:21:03] <scott_gonzalez> Also for autocomplete
[07:23:47] <tj_vantoll> The addition of the <p> looks to have shifted the version added bit down to a new line across the board.
[07:26:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how we can change that.
[07:27:22] <tj_vantoll> It's not a huge deal. I think ideally that "version added" bit would be moved to the top right corner.
[07:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> We could look into that. Maybe just `float: right`.
[07:28:58] <scott_gonzalez> rounded corners: http://cl.ly/image/351P3Y42430O
[07:29:38] <tj_vantoll> Looks better.

[09:34:02] <scott_gonzalez> I told the WG that I would work with you to get the TTWF code submitted as PRs as well.
[11:07:29] <scott_gonzalez> Has anyone looked at http://livicons.com/ ?
[11:30:08] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: strange... some don't seem to work on my version of FF!
[11:30:29] <agcolom> I'm on FF20 
[11:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> They're not all animated.
[12:08:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: for some I just see an empty rectangle but I see the icon on Safari
[12:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[12:09:45] <agcolom> FF is always prone to werid things I've noticed ;-)
[12:09:49] <agcolom> weird ^
[12:10:20] <agcolom> talking about weird things... any idea what a php example that works on local.api does not work on stage on live?
[12:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> Is it using any extensions?
[12:13:47] <agcolom> http://f.cl.ly/items/3V0n3D2F3b3h3F1A002O/iconsFF.tiff
[12:14:01] <agcolom> no I don't think so
[12:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> Can you push it to a branch?
[12:14:25] <agcolom> it is live...
[12:14:29] <agcolom> and on stage 
[12:14:41] <agcolom> http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.changePage/
[12:19:07] <agcolom> so here (the php example) the result page is not shown. However, on local it is! and what was in the input field gets shown in the result page
[12:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> checking...
[12:23:50] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is there a rule in production/stage that prevents .php files from being visible inside gw-resources?
[12:24:43] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: oh, you've found something
[12:28:13] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld s5fs: What does this do? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/wordpress/files/wordpress.conf#L59
[12:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: ^
[12:29:06] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I get a 404 on that link
[12:29:22] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Because you don't have permissions for the repo.
[12:29:42] <agcolom> ok ;-)
[12:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> or this https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/wordpress/files/wordpress.conf#L54
[12:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> I really have no idea how to read nginx configs...
[12:31:45] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm pretty sure this is from the nginx config being different than your local apache config
[12:32:08] <agcolom> ok. 
[12:35:07] <agcolom> should we wait for infra guys to have a look?
[12:39:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[12:42:06] <agcolom> ok, thanks. I've uploaded the example on my work server and it works there as well... http://users.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jqm/examplePage1.html
[12:43:16] <agcolom> ok, so I'll stop worrying about this one... Thank you...
[12:57:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: shouldn't be
[12:58:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: try_files $uri =404; means if $uri doesn't exist, 404 it
[12:58:37] <gnarf> instead of sending it through php's catchall
[12:59:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/wordpress/files/wordpress.conf#L54 -- if (!-e $request_filename) so, that whole block only runs when the file requested doesn't exist, and tries to match that regexp to do the rewrite
[13:00:18] <gnarf> whats the url you're suspecting problems with?
[13:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jquerymobile.com/resources/results.php
[13:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> The file exists on the server.
[13:02:58] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: view or api?
[13:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, api
