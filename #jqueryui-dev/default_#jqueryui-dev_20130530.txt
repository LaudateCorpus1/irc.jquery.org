[08:26:22] <Elrinth2> hi, I'm having a problem with jquery ui
[08:26:42] <scott_gonzalez> Elrinth2: Have you tracked it down to a bug inside jQuery UI?
[08:26:54] <Elrinth2> basically it's IE8 spooking with me
[08:27:13] <Elrinth2> chrome and ffox works nice.. it's the jquery appendTo which is trolling me
[08:27:27] <Elrinth2> but I've got a workaround, whihc requires some jquery ui - draggable modification
[08:27:42] <Elrinth2> basically appendTo isn't generating proper html
[08:27:42] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't answer my question. Have you proven that there is a bug inside jQuery UI?
[08:27:51] <Elrinth2> there is no bug
[08:28:12] <Elrinth2> this is just unwanted behaviour in IE8 when using jquery. (nothing wrong with ui)
[08:28:47] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: clicking on menuitems with submenus on OSX open the submenu. Though with the jQuery UI menu, you can select any item, even if there's a submenu. If we want to keep that, there's no reason to spend another second looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/998
[08:29:00] <scott_gonzalez> Elrinth2: So then why does draggable need a modification?
[08:29:17] <Elrinth2> it doesn't need modifications... I need help with my special case
[08:29:25] <Elrinth2> my code needs modification to work with ie8
[08:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do we have use cases for selecting a parent?
[08:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> Elrinth2: Then you're looking for #jquery or a forum.
[08:29:52] <Elrinth2> anyways.. I'd like to ask if there is any way to: on start event on draggable, to create a clone of the element you started moving, and move the clonse instead
[08:29:57] <Elrinth2> This is jquery ui related
[08:30:12] <scott_gonzalez> Elrinth2: This channel is not for things related to jQuery UI. It's for the development of jQuery UI.
[08:30:21] <Elrinth2> ahh sorry
[08:30:35] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: navigation menu where you can go to both the parent and the child category?
[08:30:53] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[08:30:57] <scott_gonzalez> That makes me sad.
[08:31:06] <scott_gonzalez> I've probably punted on this every time it's come up.
[08:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> ARIA menus are not navigation menus.
[08:32:01] <scott_gonzalez> Are you able to call event.preventDefault() and keep the menu open?
[08:32:33] <jzaefferer> probably not
[08:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> As crazy as this sounds, I'm thinking `role: null` should allow choosing a parent and the default should not.
[08:33:54] <scott_gonzalez> So, in a menubar situation, I can't imagine that you'd ever have a web-style navigation menu.
[08:34:18] <scott_gonzalez> While many sites do use a menubar presentation, the top-level items are navigation as well.
[08:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> Which isn't the case with our menubar, right?
[08:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it'd be impossible to to activate the top level if they could navigate.
[08:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I expect a shift to click-only activation in the future.
[08:35:13] <jzaefferer> Yeah, the hover-to-activate is there, but we should probably just remove that
[08:36:15] <jzaefferer> and can put something on the Menubar wiki page for that
[08:45:14] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: updated the menubar wiki page, emailed Steven to see if he's still interested in working on menubar, and created a ticket for menu: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9346
[08:46:23] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: do you want to go through selectmenu issues with me? I looked at the four open issues and didn't have anything to comment there. Your input would be useful.
[08:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[08:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> Sure. How much longer will you be around today?
[08:47:50] <jzaefferer> A few hours probably
[08:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's do a review after I eat lunch?
[08:50:23] <jzaefferer> ok
[08:50:50] <jzaefferer> When are you eating lunch?
[08:51:26] <scott_gonzalez> Should be ready to do the review in less than an hour.
[08:51:44] <jzaefferer> Okay, just ping me in Skype?
[08:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:26:07] <doesallmagic2> Yippie, build fixed!

[09:26:09] <doesallmagic2> * tj.vantoll: Accordion: Removing unused ui-accordion-noicons class.
[09:26:09] <doesallmagic2> * Scott Gonz√°lez: Autocomplete: Scope race condition handling to the instance. Fixes #9334 - Autocomplete: Multiple instances should be able to start asynchronous requests simultaneously.
