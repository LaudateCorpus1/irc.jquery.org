[13:07:17] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: hello
[13:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> hey nacin
[13:09:30] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: we ran into an issue testing 1.8.19 (well, 1.8.17) and figured I should at least put it on your radar. uglify.js omits the final semicolon from files, and that broke our on-the-fly concatenation.
[13:09:50] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[13:09:59] <nacin> haven't decided yet if we're going to add back the semicolons manually or adjust our concatenation to add an extra semicolon between every file.
[13:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get that fixed for 1.8.20.
[13:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> That's really annoying that it strips the last semicolon.
[13:12:19] <nacin> Yeah, I wasn't sure if it was deliberate on your end, or just a quirk. It's a byte, sure, but I imagine we're not the only one doing concatenation.
[13:13:05] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like core has a post-process script: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/build/post-compile.js#L11
[13:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8257
[13:15:34] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: thanks :-)
[14:30:43] <jzaefferer> kborchers: what was the reason for putting the menu branch on your fork? Could've gone direclty as a branch to jquery, no?
[14:48:57] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Apparently newer Uglify versions keep (actually insert) the final semicolon.
[14:49:28] <koopersmith> scott_gonzalez: So it's just a matter of updating Uglify on your end?
[14:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> Grunt was using 1.0.7. I informed ben_alman and he just updated to 1.2.6
[14:49:38] <koopersmith> Awesome.
[14:49:43] <ben_alman> it'll be in 0.4.0
[14:49:51] <koopersmith> Talk about upstream fixes. :)
[14:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: ETA?
[14:49:54] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: ben_alman: Thanks guys.
[14:50:03] <ben_alman> hmmn
[14:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> heh, WP -> jQuery -> Grunt
[14:50:11] <ben_alman> maybe i can hot patch it into 0.3.9
[14:50:40] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: We already manually applied semicolons to our trunk, so no hurry for us personally.
[14:50:53] <ben_alman> k i'm going to go back to my 0.4.0 stuff
[14:50:57] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: I think our only sane option would be to override the min task if grunt doesn't release soon.
[14:51:16] <ben_alman> you can override the helper for now
[14:51:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'll work on that now.

[19:42:24] <jq-jenkins> kris.borchers: Menu: Update divider width
[19:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Here for a minute...
[19:48:14] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: your "spaces" comments ... are you talking about the items with quotes?
[19:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[19:48:36] <kborchers> am i just confused, i thought single strings didn't need space
[19:48:44] <kborchers> quotes act as space
[19:50:08] <scott_gonzalez> I asked Rick about that, he said it's a Timmy rule.
[19:50:31] <kborchers> ok, so go back to what i was doing with spaces around them
