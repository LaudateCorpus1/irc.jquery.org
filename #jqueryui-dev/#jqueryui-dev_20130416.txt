[04:01:28] <b-ot> rxaviers: Pull request #951 by rxaviers (1w 4d ago): Cutoff duplicate parts with download builder
[04:23:36] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Check the question from billyonecan. Can you see if it's fixed with the effects branch? http://jsfiddle.net/s5U38/39/
[05:21:12] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: checking
[05:23:51] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: totally fixed
[05:23:55] <mikesherov> :-)
[05:26:28] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: billyonecan: your stack overflow question is a dupe of http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8505
[05:31:36] <billyonecan> Thanks mikesherov - I didn't manage to find that before :|
[05:31:43] <mikesherov> no problem
[05:31:58] <mikesherov> it'll be fixed in the effects rewrite
[05:32:46] <billyonecan> excellent, thanks for the info
[05:42:09] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks mikesherov
[05:53:52] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: this ticket seems like "works as expected": http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7044
[05:54:18] <mikesherov> the reported bug is that the "appendTo" option for draggable only works when helper isn't "original"
[05:54:28] <mikesherov> seems like a docs issue.
[05:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: works as expected, but we're changing the behavior in the rewrite.
[05:55:35] <mikesherov> so in the rewrite, what's the expected behavior? I feel like we had this discussion
[05:55:44] <scott_gonzalez> appendTo is always applied.
[05:55:50] <mikesherov> oh, OK
[05:56:12] <mikesherov> and if it reverts, what does it revert to? Original position?
[05:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:56:47] <mikesherov> so, basically what rworth suggests in the ticket
[05:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:57:20] <scott_gonzalez> I think this is fully implemented in the rewrite already.
[05:57:39] <mikesherov> ok, great
[05:57:47] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7251
[05:58:12] <mikesherov> this one is about whether to modify position in "axis" before or after user modifications to position
[05:58:18] <mikesherov> thoughts?
[06:00:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm inclined to say that built-in constraints run first.
[06:00:25] <scott_gonzalez> But...
[06:00:38] <scott_gonzalez> There's no way to guarantee that without hooking into _trigger(), which we shouldn't do.
[06:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> I think if the built-in constraints run first with that caveat that user-defined event handlers for constraints aren't bound before initialization of the widget.
[06:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> Then we'll be fine.
[06:02:18] <mazzachre> I am trying to add a plugin to resizable plugin... But with no luck... Can it only be done in the jqueryUI source? How what? http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/msMJN/2/
[06:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> So if you do elem.draggable({ drag: ... }) or elem.draggable().on( "drag", ... ) or $( document ).on ( "drag", ".ui-draggable", ... ) the built-in constraints run first.
[06:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> But if you do elem.on( "drag", ... ).draggable(), then the event handler will get unconstrained values.
[06:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> That way we can just .on( "dragstart", ... ) for the built-in constraints.
[06:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> mazzachre: It's not clear what "plugin" you're trying to add, but support is in #jquery.
[06:05:43] <mazzachre> Yes, have tried there too, but it is quite dead :( I am trying to add my own plugin... I will fill it out once I can see the functions running..
[06:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> mazzachre: You shouldn't use $.ui.plugin. It's deprecated.
[06:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> But as for why you're not seeing the console logs, it's because you're not using the option that you just created.
[06:07:57] <scott_gonzalez> You need to specify a value for the option or the code won't run.
[06:09:24] <scott_gonzalez> Who wants to explain why rebasing a branch onto itself would ever cause a conflict?
[06:10:17] <mazzachre> Oh, how do I add functionality to resize without forking it then?
[06:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> mazzachre: That depends on what version of jQuery UI you're using.
[06:11:44] <mazzachre> 1.8.20 in our production env... with jquery 1.7.2
[06:12:16] <mazzachre> Oh, and now I got it to run the functions... Thx for that
[06:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there are a few ways to create an extension that only hooks into the events.
[06:13:12] <scott_gonzalez> You can do it by just adding event handlers to the document.
[06:13:25] <scott_gonzalez> And checking the option from the event target.
[06:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> Or you can proxy the _create() method and bind the event handlers directly to the instance.
[06:13:53] <scott_gonzalez> Or you can use the deprecated $.ui.plugin.
[06:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be around until at least 1.13.
[06:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> But just FYI, if you run into bugs, there won't be any more 1.8.x releases.
[06:17:27] <mazzachre> OK... thx. Well, I have tried with event handlers, but I apparently conflict with the widget somehow... I am trying to add scrolling support to resize, so resizing to the side of the container will scroll it and allow for larger resize...
