[02:09:20] <snapfractalpop> are there any examples of how to use jqueryui with browserify?
[02:09:32] <snapfractalpop> I can't seem to find anything that works
[03:03:41] <snapfractalpop> I was able to get it working by calling require on all the dependencies that were in the AMD define function
[03:04:27] <snapfractalpop> e.g. draggable has const $ = require('jquery'); 
[03:04:30] <snapfractalpop> window.$ = $;
[03:04:32] <snapfractalpop> require('bootstrap');
[03:04:44] <snapfractalpop> oops.. I mean:
[03:05:08] <snapfractalpop> [ "jquery", "./mouse", "../data", "../plugin", "../safe-active-element", "../safe-blur", "../scroll-pa     rent", "../version", "../widget" ]
[03:06:29] <snapfractalpop> so I did: require('jquery-ui/ui/widgets/mouse'); require('jquery-ui/ui/data'); etc
[03:06:46] <snapfractalpop> this feels broken.. and I suppose is?
[03:07:14] <snapfractalpop> is there a better way to be requiring when using browserify?
