[01:57:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[01:57:22] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[01:57:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was looking at 1.4-stable tests and noticed "127.0.0.1:60666 [404]: /external/jquery.js - No such file or directory"
[01:58:05] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... weird ...
[01:58:10] <uGoMobi> yeah
[01:58:43] <_|Nix|_> It's present on master as well.
[01:59:11] <_|Nix|_> It should be /external/jquery/jquery.js
[01:59:17] <_|Nix|_> Somewhere, the path is wrong.
[01:59:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is this related to the problem that occured after I updated jQuery core on master? the problem that you fixed?
[01:59:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, so it's different
[02:01:11] <_|Nix|_> /index.php has the wrong jquery reference.
[02:01:55] <_|Nix|_> What component is /index.php?
[02:02:04] <_|Nix|_> I'll commit and make a PR.
[02:02:13] <_|Nix|_> "Demos"?
[02:02:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I would say "Build"
[02:02:26] <_|Nix|_> That doesn't make any sense.
[02:02:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh wait, you're right
[02:02:38] <_|Nix|_> So, "Demos"?
[02:02:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: "Demos" sounds good
[02:02:44] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[02:02:57] <uGoMobi> thanks
[02:03:18] <_|Nix|_> Yep. That was it. No more 404.

[02:06:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There you go ^
[02:06:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great
[02:08:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/27846242#L1492
[02:09:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do we change this reference in the build process?
[02:09:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: have to make sure it still works on server and in build
[02:10:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You can check on view.
[02:10:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: on it
[02:11:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: /index.php doesn't really use any JS. It's just a redirect, so we never noticed.
[02:13:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think you can use view to check it.
[02:13:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... because view uses a server-side redirect.
[02:13:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aaah, but this works: http://view.jquerymobile.com/7511-fix-core-reference-404/dist/
[02:14:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah, smart thinking :)
[02:14:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep - compare that link to http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/dist/ and you will see that master has a bunch of errors while the branch has none.
[02:43:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, may I have a üëç for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7512?
[02:44:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you assigned it to arschmitz ;-)
[02:44:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will review
[02:47:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I always assign to arschmitz, because he's the default reviewer.
[02:47:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but in cases when others may review as well, I ask personally.
[02:47:50] <_|Nix|_> Maybe I shouldn't do it that way ...
[02:48:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nah, it's fine, just kidding
[02:49:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I do think it's good that even with small changes like this, arschmitz reviews as well
[02:49:43] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, after all, it should only take a second.
[02:49:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just to make sure we didn't miss something
[02:50:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is no rush and I think we should take more than a second
[02:50:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What I find interesting is that casper doesn't throw more of a fuss. After all, 404 is pretty serious. Why doesn't the build fail because of that?
[02:50:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: like now, I am looking when this was introduced
[02:51:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly
[02:51:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Probably when we started organizing our bower dependencies.
[02:52:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The location of jquery.js may initially have been /external/jquery.js, but then we decided that each external dependency shall have its own directory.
[02:52:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: could be
[02:53:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just want to check because it might reveal other issues
[02:53:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IINM, casper was toned down so as not to spuriously break the build. I wonder if we can distinguish between a spurious failure and a legit failure.
[02:54:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, we might have to give that another look
[02:54:36] <_|Nix|_> find -type f | grep -vE '(\.git|node_modules|/dist|_tests)'  | awk '{ printf( $0 "\0" ); }' | xargs -0 grep -niH 'external/jquery.js'
[02:54:50] <_|Nix|_> That's what I used to find which files refer to core as external/jquery.js
[02:55:11] <_|Nix|_> If you wanna nab files that have invalid paths in them, that's the way to go.
[02:55:25] <_|Nix|_> Just replace the regex at the end of the line with a pattern you know to be wrong.
[02:58:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/cfc11954170e615b73950bc7517d4c3ef679be93
[02:59:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: index.php in the root was missing there
[03:00:48] <_|Nix|_> Right. Not surprising. That's a lot of files touched. Easy to miss one.
[03:01:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am gonna :+1 your PR
[03:01:29] <_|Nix|_> You can hide, 404, but you can't run!
[03:01:36] <uGoMobi> lol

[07:38:00] <uGoMobi> well, first it's TEST release time
[07:38:25] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, for sure, to make sure https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7310 is fixed.
[07:38:44] <uGoMobi> right
[07:38:57] <_|Nix|_> ... and https://github.om/jquery/demos.jquerymobile.com/issues/4
[07:39:01] <uGoMobi> but not only test the transitions demo
[07:39:05] <uGoMobi> yup
[07:39:22] <uGoMobi> we really have to go over all demos
[07:43:25] <uGoMobi> I am going to land https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/297 now
[07:44:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: on the website we say that we support jQuery 1.8 - 1.10 / 2.0
[07:44:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: i have it running a final full test set now then i will push to master
[07:45:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we don't test 1.4-stable against 1.11 and 2.1, but I did test local without issues
[07:46:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: why dont i push a branch with a travis update to double check?
[07:46:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so I suggest we are going to officially support those versions
[07:46:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure, good idea
[07:46:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think we should but not until 1.4-stable is green on travis
[07:46:40] <uGoMobi> don't want to stay on 1.10/2.0 until 1.5 is out
[07:46:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: agreed
[07:48:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just have to wait until my test run for master finishes lol
[07:48:28] <arschmitz> cant switch branches
[07:48:41] <uGoMobi> right, that might take a while
[07:49:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ~20
[07:50:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: oh so i found something when it comes to our flaky tests
[07:50:52] <arschmitz> tests on travis only seem to fail when the load is really high and the test runs for nav actually take 5 minutes longer with highload
[07:51:25] <arschmitz> so they are totally just ajax timeouts because the server load is too high

[09:15:25] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#1881 (master - 18d6b12 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build is still failing.

[09:18:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: fyi tests fail on 1.4 after cherry-pick so im looking into it 
[09:27:16] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1271, what's devDependency jquery used for, demos?
[09:29:33] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: its used to specify the version we install in the repo, for demos and unit testing. The other one is what the user needs at least when installing jQuery UI via bower
[09:29:46] <jzaefferer> Since we don't want to test against 2.x, we need this workaround
[09:30:13] <jzaefferer> Seemed better then hardcoding somewhere in the grund file
[09:30:19] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: does that make (enough) sense?
[09:30:30] <rxaviers> please, update me on something, are we dropping the test/jquery-x.js files?
[09:35:46] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ^
[09:48:42] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: check out https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1266 (preferably locally, the files tab is pretty slow)
[09:49:02] <jzaefferer> in short, we're keeping the files, but moving them to the externals/ folder
[09:53:18] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ah! really cool way to specify them all in bower.json.
[09:53:46] <rxaviers> What if on tests, we simply ignore jquery.js (since it's a duplicate of jquery-1.10.2)
[09:54:15] <rxaviers> then, we could leave jquery as ">=1.6"
[09:54:31] <rxaviers> demo could use any supported jquery, right? ie. jquery 2?
[09:58:15] <jzaefferer> No, demos should also run in IE8, which jQuery 2.x doesn't support
[10:04:23] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, why?
[10:04:29] <rxaviers> why they should run on IE8?
[10:04:41] <rxaviers> on a local dev env
[10:10:20] <gschulhof> Yaay! I didn't know I could add nicks to an existing account.
[10:11:37] <arschmitz> gschulhof: awesome!
[10:14:05] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: because we also test demos on IE8
[10:14:05] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Apparently, gschulhof has become an alias for _|Nix|_
[10:14:30] <jzaefferer> gschulhof: WHO ARE YOU??
[10:15:13] <gschulhof> jzaefferer: _|Nix|_
[10:15:35] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, how often?
[10:15:40] <jzaefferer> gschulhof: :-)
[10:15:56] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I can't tell what you're getting at
[10:16:02] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Sp, step 1, log in and identify with your old nick, step 2, change nick, step 3, /msg NickServ group.
[10:16:14] <rxaviers> because, if it's sporadic, one could change bower.json just for the test purpose.
[10:16:22] <jzaefferer> that sounds terrible
[10:16:24] <gschulhof> arschmitz: ... and bam! Your new nick is aliased to your old.
[10:16:26] <rxaviers> why?
[10:16:59] <jzaefferer> Its not just changing bower.json, you also have to run `grunt bower`, then remember to revert the changes before commiting
[10:17:09] <jzaefferer> for what?
[10:17:27] <rxaviers> allowing jquery be  >=1.6
[10:17:41] <jzaefferer> I'm mean we've "always" included a copy of jQuery that we primarly test against. It doesn't matter that much how that copy is created.
[10:17:46] <rxaviers> whenever something starts getting too complicated, it sounds me wrong.
[10:18:19] <rxaviers> well, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1271 seems to affect
[10:18:19] <rxaviers> hehe
[10:18:27] <rxaviers> But, ok. thanks
[10:18:34] <rxaviers> I got it
[10:18:40] <jzaefferer> Yes, and it should. Its just that we want to test against one specific version (range), while allowing users to install whatever jQuery version they want along with UI
[10:19:19] <jzaefferer> As long as bower offer a way to resolve that conflict on the user end, I guess we need to jump through this extra hoop
[10:19:22] <rxaviers> test is covered by the various jquery-x
[10:19:51] <jzaefferer> with my proposed change to grunt-bowercopy, that extra task wouldn't be necessary
[10:20:35] <jzaefferer> sure, but demos! :-)
[10:20:39] <gschulhof> jzaefferer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgBViHeiSKM#t=1m20s
[10:21:15] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: there's always room for improvement, but if you think my PR is okay for now, I'd land that (soon) so that we at least play nice with bower for 1.11
[10:21:38] <rxaviers> ah sure, my point is not go against it.
[10:21:44] <rxaviers> I think your PR is better than current state.
[10:21:55] <rxaviers> I am just trying to understand it.
[10:22:14] <rxaviers> I guess scott's PR will land afterwards. So, I am adding a comment there.
[10:22:35] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:22:39] <jzaefferer> I appreciate the input
[10:22:56] <jzaefferer> gschulhof: I'm not getting it. What are you telling me?
[10:23:58] <gschulhof> jzaefferer: Until now, my nick did not reflect my /real/ name.
[10:24:38] <rxaviers> thanks for explaining :D
[10:24:58] <jzaefferer> gschulhof: rad
[10:25:05] <gschulhof> :)
[10:25:31] <jzaefferer> So are you Morpheus or Neo?
[10:25:44] <gschulhof> jzaefferer: Neo.
[10:29:27] <jzaefferer> I could ask who Trinity is, but that might get awkward
[10:31:28] <gschulhof> jzaefferer: :)
[10:34:06] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Re: 1.4-stable failure. Did you add the prefix (init -> jquery.mobile.init)?
[10:34:21] <arschmitz> gschulhof: already fixed and yes that was it
[10:34:37] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[10:34:56] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I'm glad that's all it was.
[10:35:10] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yup nothing big didnt think it was i was just letting you know
[10:35:33] <arschmitz> gschulhof: did you see my messages about tests?
[10:35:53] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yes.
[10:35:54] <arschmitz> gschulhof: the flakey nav ones?
[10:36:13] <arschmitz> gschulhof: so i have an idea to test my theory but im not sure it will work
[10:36:47] <arschmitz> gschulhof: im going to keep opening programs and running things until im just about out of memory
[10:37:00] <arschmitz> gschulhof: and hen try and run the tests and see if i can force a failure
[10:37:35] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I would suggest I/O-bound stuff.
[10:37:44] <gschulhof> copy lots of files around.
[10:37:50] <gschulhof> That should hang the server pretty good.
[10:38:12] <gschulhof> arschmitz: ... though if you're running on an SSD, that's gonna be really hard to accomplish.
[10:38:21] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yeah and actually thats whats happening when we run our tests too come to think of it 
[10:38:24] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i am
[10:38:34] <gschulhof> arschmitz: You could also try to nice the server to +19 and then run something in a tight loop.
[10:38:38] <arschmitz> because there are tons of projects being built at the same time
[10:38:59] <arschmitz> including ours 5 times at a time lol
[10:39:11] <arschmitz> and think of all the npm installs
[10:39:13] <arschmitz> all running
[10:39:46] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yes yes, but it's up to travis to throttle things.
[10:39:58] <arschmitz> gschulhof: right but i think thats not happening well enough
[10:40:04] <gschulhof> arschmitz: They could refuse to start new jobs/builds if the load gets above a threshold.
[10:40:13] <arschmitz> gschulhof: and i think we are having ajax requests time out
[10:40:24] <arschmitz> gschulhof: pretty sure they do
[10:40:31] <arschmitz> but its not low enough
[10:40:58] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Does pagecontainerloadfailed propagate the XMLHTTPRequest result and error code and all that as part of the second argument to the event handler?
[10:41:28] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i dont think so but im honestly not sure
[10:41:31] <gschulhof> arschmitz: If so, we could add pagecontainerloadfailed handlers to all our tests that load external pages, and put a console log in there.
[10:41:34] <arschmitz> TO THE PAGE EVENTS DEMO!
[10:43:16] <arschmitz> gschulhof: we put the xhr object in the ui object
[10:43:28] <gschulhof> arschmitz: OK, then we can add the handler.
[10:43:57] <gschulhof> I'll go through the tests and stick a handler on the document which will record any Ajax failures.
[10:44:27] <arschmitz> gschulhof: perfect we can run it un travis until we get a failure and then check the output
[10:44:43] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Although, TBH, I've seen many more casper and coverage failures than I've seen failures within the qunit-based tests.
[10:45:00] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i know i already opened issues about those too
[10:46:01] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i think the casper tests are almost worse then the sequence ones
[10:46:38] <arschmitz> gschulhof: and if im right we can just force pass tests that the ajax request times out
[10:46:56] <arschmitz> for sequence ones
[10:48:05] <gschulhof> arschmitz: So sequence ones really break that often? Ever since the casper failures, I'm not noticing anymore.. I need to restart so many jobs that the odd timeout within the qunit tests doesn't even register anymore.
[10:48:36] <arschmitz> gschulhof: just say hey if its an ajax timeout we dont care thats the servers problem not ours
[10:48:53] <arschmitz> gschulhof: we still have the same random failures we always have in nav
[10:49:10] <arschmitz> the sequence ones just do it more often because they do a lot more navigations
[10:49:22] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess when you're dealing with Ajax, you /are/ making the assumption that the request will succeed.
[10:49:25] <arschmitz> and the more navigations you do the more opportunities there are to time out 
[10:49:39] <gschulhof> arschmitz: You know, we might be able to mock it.
[10:49:57] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Just put the HTML in a JS string, and pass it to the handler after we unwind the stack.
[10:50:09] <arschmitz> so its any test that involves nav that is flaky 
[10:50:40] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yeah iv thought about that but it just does not feel right lol
[10:50:57] <arschmitz> but i guess thats the whole point of haveing the built in ability to mock ajax requests
[10:51:17] <gschulhof> Well, we have to, and as long as it's no less asynchronous that real Ajax, it's justifiable.
[10:51:26] <gschulhof> s/that/than/
[10:51:47] <gschulhof> Anyway, one step at a time. Let's see if it really is an Ajax failure.
[10:52:04] <gschulhof> I'll make an issue/PR.
[10:52:59] <arschmitz> gschulhof: let me check with jzaefferer and julian and see what they both think of that and if its still a good test of nav that way
[10:53:13] <arschmitz> gschulhof: because if they think its ok we should do it regardless
[10:53:19] <arschmitz> less room for error and MUCH faster
[10:53:24] <arschmitz> MUCH MUCH faster
[10:53:37] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #7513: Tests: Spurious nav test failures 02http://git.io/Fu3w8Q

[12:01:51] <gschulhof> arschmitz: ^
[12:01:53] <gschulhof> jasperdegroot: ^
[12:02:01] <gschulhof> gseguin: ^
[12:02:05] <gschulhof> agcolom: ^
[12:02:16] <gschulhof> ... and whoever else wants to look at it.
[12:08:09] <arschmitz> gschulhof: why do you still leave the select but disabled?
[12:08:13] <arschmitz> it seems odd
[12:08:33] <arschmitz> oh i see to restore them
[12:09:36] <arschmitz> gschulhof: im curious though why dont you just make it a multiple select and keep all options all the time?
[12:17:21] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I wanted to diverge a little from the built-in UI.
[12:17:36] <gschulhof> arschmitz: That's essentially what we have with the built-in UI.
[12:18:00] <gschulhof> arschmitz: It doesn't have to be useful, it just has to illustrate that it's possible to do the UI differently.
[12:18:19] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yeah it just seems odd to me...
[12:18:43] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I tried hiding the select, but it causes the whole table to jump, because the page gets shorted.
[12:18:44] <arschmitz> gschulhof: oh what about make the bar checkboxes in a control group instead
[12:18:46] <gschulhof> shorter.
[12:19:16] <gschulhof> arschmitz: They're a table header row. I'm not sure I can turn a TR into a controlgroup.
[12:19:30] <arschmitz> they dont need to be though
[12:19:45] <arschmitz> you could just put a controlgroup above the table and toggel it with that
[12:20:11] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i dont know i guess it does not matter but the disabled select just seems odd when you first get to the page
[12:20:21] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Well, if it's a vertical controlgroup, it's kinda big, and if it's a horizontal controlgroup, it defeats the purpose of serving narrow screens.
[12:20:38] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Aaah, good point. On initial viewing.
[12:21:04] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I'd also rather hide it, but I wanna do it so it doesn't interfere with page height.
[12:21:09] <arschmitz> gschulhof: infact what it makes it look like is its just a normal one you disabled and added the bar to
[12:21:44] <gschulhof> arschmitz: yeah ... hmmm ... I couldn't think of a different UI for turning columns on/off.
[12:22:00] <arschmitz> gschulhof: navbar footer
[12:22:13] <gschulhof> Hmmm ... not bad.
[12:22:14] <arschmitz> or rather controlgroup footer or header
[12:22:24] <arschmitz> that they are checkboxes and toggle
[12:22:34] <arschmitz> so its kinda like a full screen table
[12:22:47] <arschmitz> with tap toggel and fixed
[12:23:07] <gschulhof> OK. I'll do it that way.
[12:23:11] <arschmitz> oh oh i got it so fixed header thats a table row thats the headers for the table
[12:23:31] <arschmitz> fotter which is a checkbox controlgroup and toggles the fixed header and the table columns
[12:24:02] <arschmitz> gschulhof: thats an actually real life use case for easy table viewing
[12:24:15] <arschmitz> and the fixed table header i think will be nice
[12:24:16] <gschulhof> arschmitz: ... but then I'd have to make it a full-page demo.
[12:24:26] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yup you will :)
[12:24:42] <gschulhof> Hmmm ... alright. Lessee here ...
[12:25:28] <gschulhof> ... and all this for illustrating .table( "option", "columnUi", false ) :)
[12:26:17] <arschmitz> and the new method for setting a column visibility
[12:26:28] <gschulhof> Right, good point - and that.
[12:26:44] <gschulhof> Man, I dunno ... can a table's TR be turned into a fixed toolbar?
[12:26:58] <arschmitz> gschulhof: dont need to
[12:26:58] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz pushed 2 new commits to 061.4-stable: 02http://git.io/8BsDEA

[12:27:04] <arschmitz> gschulhof: you make 2 tables
[12:27:22] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Right, but then the column boundaries won't line up.
[12:27:34] <arschmitz> why wouldnt they?
[12:27:41] <arschmitz> oh right never mind yeah
[12:27:47] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Because the header is bound to have some padding whereas the table won't.
[12:28:00] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I could make the header fixed.
[12:28:02] <arschmitz> gschulhof: no not that you can fix that
[12:28:16] <gschulhof> arschmitz: What then?
[12:28:20] <arschmitz> its the fact that the contained data will have different lengths
[12:28:20] * gschulhof is just curious
[12:28:26] <gschulhof> Riiiight!
[12:28:44] <gschulhof> Too bad you can't clone objects at the DOM level.
[12:28:45] <arschmitz> but yeah i have not tryed setting a tr to fixed position before
[12:28:47] <arschmitz> try it lol
[12:29:00] <gschulhof> arschmitz: If you hear a loud explosion, duck!
[12:30:27] <arschmitz> gschulhof: it does not work properly
[12:30:38] <arschmitz> it gets fixed but the columns losewidth
[12:32:23] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Hmmm ... that's weird ... I wonder why that happens.
[12:32:39] <gschulhof> Might get wrapped in something.
[12:32:55] <arschmitz> gschulhof: no its because its removed from the flow of elements
[12:33:03] <arschmitz> so it might as well be cloned into body
[12:33:21] <gschulhof> Oh, I see.
[12:33:52] <gschulhof> Man, that sucks. So, the only way to do it for a table is to fake it with position: relative.
[12:34:09] <gschulhof> ... and lots of scroll-handling.
[12:34:16] <arschmitz> gschulhof: nah
[12:34:21] <gschulhof> .i.e, our old fixed-toolbar polyfill.
[12:34:24] <arschmitz> gschulhof: just when you toggle set the widths
[12:34:48] <arschmitz> use a regular navbar with set widths that match the table cell widths
[12:35:39] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... the buttons in the toolbar need match no widths, otherwise if I hide a column, the button to show the column will have width 0 :)
[12:35:56] <gschulhof> Or wait, you wanted both a header and a footer.
[12:36:01] <arschmitz> gschulhof: right
[12:36:08] <arschmitz> the fotter always shows every column
[12:36:14] <gschulhof> Right.
[12:36:16] <arschmitz> the header shows only the visible ones
[12:36:31] <gschulhof> arschmitz: This is sooo gonna have off-by-one-px errors on various devices.
[12:36:40] <arschmitz> gschulhof: thats ok
[12:36:56] <arschmitz> thats what we have css experts for lol
[12:37:05] <gschulhof> :)
[12:38:49] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i have 2 new recruits just waiting for something to tackle too!
[12:43:26] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Well, I'm terrible at CSS, so I should give them lots of head-scratching and/or laughs :)
[12:57:12] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Here's what I've got so far: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/demos/table-column-toggle-custom-ui/page2.html
[12:57:18] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I'll continue tomorrow.
[12:57:24] <arschmitz> gschulhof: cool
[12:57:34] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I know, eh! Thanks for the idea!
[12:58:07] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I'll add more movies to cause it to scroll.
[12:58:24] <arschmitz> gschulhof: and you didnt do the footer yet did you?
[12:58:42] <arschmitz> to actually control it
[12:58:56] <gschulhof> No, not yet
[12:59:31] <arschmitz> oh and thats not a header lol thats just the same table alone on a page
[13:00:03] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yep, but with a fixed header instantiated on the first row of thead.
[13:00:30] <arschmitz> oh why dont you just add a seperate header?
[13:01:12] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Well, it maintains the semantics.
[13:01:36] <arschmitz> true and we can just adjust css
[13:01:41] <gschulhof> Yep.
[13:01:42] <arschmitz> and make those not buttons
[13:01:59] <arschmitz> i think just making them normal celss will do the trick
[13:02:11] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I tried to add ui-btn to the td, but it didn't work.
[13:02:22] <arschmitz> gschulhof: just dont make them buttons at all
[13:02:27] <arschmitz> non interactive
[13:02:37] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Oh, right! They're not clickable anymore.
[13:02:41] <gschulhof> Good point.
[13:02:41] <arschmitz> right
[13:02:49] <arschmitz> so just plain old th's
[13:02:53] <gschulhof> Right.
[13:02:56] <arschmitz> with the text in them
[13:03:06] <arschmitz> i think it will look perfect then
[13:03:33] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Alright, alright ... I tweak it some more.
[13:03:44] <arschmitz> :)
[13:04:03] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i think this may at some point be extension worthy
[13:04:14] <arschmitz> its a really good way to view a table
[13:04:56] <gschulhof> Yeah.
[13:05:00] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: regarding the 1.4.3 release; are you still working on the flaky tests?
[13:05:20] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: no those were not for 1.4.3
[13:05:26] <arschmitz> we were just talking in general
[13:05:27] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Oooh! Nice! Refresh that link.
[13:05:49] <arschmitz> 1.4.3 is ready but i have not seen gseguin|away all day
[13:06:01] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ok
[13:06:05] <arschmitz> never heard from him when we pinged this morning
[13:06:06] <jasperdegroot> gseguin|away: ping
[13:06:26] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I spoke with gseguin|away earlier today
[13:06:33] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: oh ok 
[13:06:41] <gseguin> I'm here
[13:06:54] <gseguin> sorry guys, was at lunch
[13:07:06] <gseguin> arschmitz, jasperdegroot: ^
[13:07:12] <arschmitz> gseguin: no problem maybe we just shoot for as early as you can tomorrow moring?
[13:07:14] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: was just waiting for the tests to finish after you pushed to 1.4-stable
[13:07:25] <arschmitz> getting late again 
[13:07:39] <jasperdegroot> too bad they fail on travis
[13:07:49] <gseguin> I can do it after the tests pass on travis
[13:07:51] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: lol yeah stupid flakey tests...
[13:07:58] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[13:08:17] <jasperdegroot> everything passes local
[13:08:33] <arschmitz> its re-running now it was just one set and not nav should only be a few minutes
[13:08:44] <jasperdegroot> ok
[13:09:00] <arschmitz> but do we want to release after 5pm eastern?
[13:09:19] <arschmitz> and really a lot later then that since we have not even done a test release and tested that yet
[13:09:34] <jasperdegroot> gseguin: will you be around tomorrow?
[13:09:44] <gseguin> jasperdegroot: I should be
[13:10:06] <gseguin> jasperdegroot: if I don't respond on IRC, ping me on hangouts
[13:10:22] <arschmitz> gseguin: why dont we plan on as soon as your available right then and do a test release and test it tonight?
[13:10:52] <arschmitz> so in the morning its basically just "hitting the buttons"
[13:11:16] <gseguin> arschmitz: want me to do an RC-1 after the tests have passed?
[13:11:30] <gseguin> or just test release?
[13:11:33] <arschmitz> gseguin: nah just do a test release
[13:11:36] <gseguin> ok
[13:11:44] <arschmitz> and check the copied demos from that
[13:11:55] <jasperdegroot> yeah, that's the most important part
[13:11:58] <arschmitz> becasue we need to make sure we dont get the weird recursion in transitions again
[13:12:08] <jasperdegroot> ok, sounds like a plan
[13:12:29] <arschmitz> and just try to go down the left nav panel and click each link and make sure they load and look ok on the surface
[13:13:01] <jasperdegroot> I will prepare the ThemeRoller as well, so I just have to swap the JS and CSS
[13:13:18] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: awesome sounds good
[13:13:54] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: do you create a branch to tests against core 1.11.1 and 2.1.1 ?
[13:13:57] <arschmitz> so in the moring we just need to tag jquerymobile.com / themeroller.jquerymobile.com and run the release and publish the blog
[13:14:01] <gseguin> ok, local branch is ready 
[13:14:19] <gseguin> as soon as the tests pass I'll trigger a test release
[13:14:23] <jasperdegroot> yup, and tag the API docs repo
[13:15:26] <gseguin> the AUTHORS.txt needs updated
[13:15:35] <arschmitz> gseguin: coveralls keeps failing us
[13:16:26] <gseguin> arschmitz: maybe a problem on their side?
[13:16:44] <arschmitz> gseguin: i think so it happens a lot too

[13:43:07] <arschmitz> gseguin: yup
[13:44:07] <arschmitz> gseguin: no idea how on earth that works with jquery not git though??!?!?!?!?!

[14:12:21] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Oh, *facepalm* ... The correction was the right thing to do in master, but it did not need to be cherry-picked back.
[14:13:05] <gschulhof> D'oh!
[14:48:01] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yeah but i dont get how it worked with other versions of jquery?!?!?!
[15:39:34] * gseguin wonders if he should change his handle too ;)
