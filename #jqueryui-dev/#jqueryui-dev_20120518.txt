[00:07:56] <rodaz_laptop> Hi, I'm working with jquery-easyui, and it's been a huge help, but I'm having a little issue. Strange as it might sound, can I set a draggable object to have more than one handle?

[07:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[07:08:04] <kborchers> if you look at this http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/jSnYq/

[07:08:23] <kborchers> put your mouse over the div and then use the keyboard to refresh
[07:08:33] <kborchers> ff is the only one that fires mouseenter on load
[07:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds like a Firefox implementation
[07:09:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: this has been driving me nuts with 7024
[07:10:05] <kborchers> no way to stop it in ff
[07:10:30] * scott_gonzalez opens Firefox
[07:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> Let me go to the browser vendors with this one...
[07:11:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: only way i kind of got it working was to move the fix i had in the pr into menu but that caused lots of other issues because it wasn't easy to know when to reset the flag
[07:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:12:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: thanks, i'll shelf that for now and let me know if you hear anything
[07:13:18] <kborchers> spent way too much time on it
[07:14:50] <scott_gonzalez> Firefox is the only browser that does this, correct?
[07:15:03] <scott_gonzalez> All other browsers, including all versions of IE, don't trigger an event?
[07:15:39] <kborchers> let me double check with that reduced test but when testing autocomplete it wasn't happening in any other browser even back to ie6
[07:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/jSnYq/1/
[07:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> I removed jQuery.
[07:17:02] <kborchers> but isn't mouseenter only IE?
[07:17:19] <kborchers> i guess not
[07:17:41] <kborchers> still fires on load though in FF
[07:17:44] <kborchers> i'll check ie
[07:17:53] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[07:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> You can't use my reduced test in IE :-P
[07:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> I used addEventListener :-P
[07:18:13] <kborchers> oh, oops
[07:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> I could switch to onmouseenter
[07:18:29] <kborchers> yeah
[07:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...no onmouseenter
[07:19:39] <kborchers> stupid browsers
[07:21:41] <scott_gonzalez> IE triggers mouseover on load
[07:22:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmmm, guess that didn't bother me since we are using mouseenter

[07:22:37] <jq-jenkins> joern.zaefferer: Menu: Tests for role option
[07:23:36] <scott_gonzalez> So I asked if there was anything in the specs about this.
[07:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> Anne laughed at me :-/
[07:24:40] <kborchers> well, that wasn't nice
[07:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> heh, he was laughing because there's not much defined for mouse.
[07:32:32] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i might have an idea. it's hacky but i'll let you know
[07:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:33:42] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like the original idea should work

[09:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure, I noticed it, but didn't bother looking into it yet.
[09:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> Just ignore it.
[09:54:33] <scott_gonzalez> You can add ?nojshint=true to turn it off
[09:54:49] <kborchers> ok, i thought i remembered you could turn it off

[10:07:25] <scott_gonzalez> I give up.
[10:11:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: wow
[10:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> He hasn't understood a single one of my replies in either of his tickets (he filed another one about blur).
[10:14:02] <kborchers> to be fair, focus and blur are hell to deal with ... but yeah, try understanding the response before replying with more nonsense

[12:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> Well, fakes mousemove
[12:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> *mouseover
[12:20:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess at that point all that matters is that it's not key*
[12:22:15] <kborchers> yeah, we could change it if you want
[12:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> Can we make menu not care about the event?
[12:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's an easy update.
[12:25:26] <scott_gonzalez> We'll also need to update autocomplete to not care though :-P
[12:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> Let me play around with your change.
[12:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> I think we can simplify this a bit if we land a few other changes.
[12:26:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, let me know if you need anything from me
[12:26:22] <scott_gonzalez> Also, you can't reference document inside a widget anymore :-P
[12:26:36] <scott_gonzalez> You need to use this.document[0] so that it works cross-window.
[12:27:01] <scott_gonzalez> Or in this case, just this.document, since you want a jQuery object.
[12:27:22] <kborchers> oh, ok
[12:28:14] <kborchers> should have noticed that like 10 lines up :/
[12:29:15] <scott_gonzalez> My inbox fits on my monitor!
