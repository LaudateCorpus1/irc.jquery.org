[05:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Some back story on stale PRs...
[05:30:38] <mikesherov> I love this back stories
[05:30:45] <mikesherov> it's like story time with scott_gonzalez
[05:30:51] <mikesherov> these*
[05:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> As jzaefferer mentioned, we obviously don't have the manpower to do everything right now.
[05:31:28] <scott_gonzalez> And 1.9 was taking forever.
[05:31:34] <mikesherov> gotta prioritize. I get it
[05:31:38] <mikesherov> so it was heads down time
[05:31:45] <scott_gonzalez> So long, in fact, that jzaefferer got mad and made me cut scope.
[05:32:01] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so I was heads down on specific plugins, literally for years.
[05:32:17] <scott_gonzalez> And that trend will continue until we get out of this hole.
[05:32:20] <mikesherov> block by block
[05:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> Which, luckily you and TJ and doing a great job of helping with :-)
[05:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> So every once in a while, we would actually go through the PR queue.
[05:32:45] <mikesherov> sure, I think that makes sense for a team that doesn't have me and TJ on it
[05:32:55] <mikesherov> right
[05:33:07] <mikesherov> I think we can discuss  Wednesday expanding our reach a bit
[05:33:07] <scott_gonzalez> And the result was generally us taking notes, but not being entirely sure what to do for a lot of them: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/49747935/Pull%20Request%20Reviews
[05:33:28] <scott_gonzalez> You'll notice there are a lot that say "need CSS review"
[05:33:31] <mikesherov> yeah, that's from that oksoclap doc
[05:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> We used to have a design team, but they defected to Mobile :-P
[05:33:41] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:33:57] <mikesherov> so do we need 1 css guy?
[05:33:57] <scott_gonzalez> So those reviews never happened.
[05:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> We've been doing ok since we accepted reality and stopped relying on the old design team.
[05:34:42] <scott_gonzalez> But having someone really knowledgable in CSS would certainly help.
[05:34:42] <mikesherov> right
[05:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> Then you'll notice that some of them have comments like "can we fix the underyling bug" or "can be addressed by .ui-front?" or "wait until refactor"
[05:36:38] <mikesherov> sure, I mean, my main concern is simply how it looks from an outsider perspective.
[05:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> And I felt like I couldn't prioritize that research ahead of the 1.9 plugins.
[05:36:46] <mikesherov> yeah, I agree 100%
[05:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, I've had the same concern for a long time.
[05:36:54] <mikesherov> I understand the choices you guys made
[05:37:08] <mikesherov> it makes total sense
[05:37:08] <scott_gonzalez> Right now it's very hard to contribute to UI if it's not something on the roadmap for the next release.
[05:37:14] <mikesherov> yup
[05:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> And that sucks.
[05:37:32] <mikesherov> and I guess I'm saying that I'd like my contribution to be changing that perception / reality
[05:37:38] <mikesherov> it started with the bug tracker cleanup
[05:37:44] <mikesherov> next it'll be the PR queue
[05:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> Right, and I think they are.
[05:38:02] <scott_gonzalez> So, something like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/185
[05:38:10] <scott_gonzalez> We can't land that, because it'll just add to the pile.
[05:38:14] <mikesherov> right
[05:38:27] <mikesherov> and it makes sens for that to wait for a milestone release
[05:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> lindstroem knows this, so he's just waiting.
[05:38:40] <mikesherov> I get waiting on the features
[05:39:13] <mikesherov> I'm saying that, given tests and and a responsive contributor, we should land any bug fix
[05:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> As I mentioned before, we've had lots of regressions in interactions when landing fixes.
[05:39:18] <mikesherov> that'll tackle 90% of the queue
[05:39:29] <scott_gonzalez> Which you've now seen first hand with the floating sortable bug.
[05:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> So getting the test suites passing and requiring tests will definitley help there.
[05:39:50] <mikesherov> sure, but I've also seen that happen because the original fix had no tests
[05:40:00] <scott_gonzalez> But I have a feeling that building up the test suite will just bring in even more regressions along the way.
[05:40:09] <mikesherov> I can't tell BlazeCell to fix it, because what he'd need to do first is write tests for the original fix!
[05:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> right
[05:40:41] <mikesherov> Well, I mean, I think it's my duty to speak in defense of tests here
[05:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> So in that case it might be better to just revert the fix and go back to the original fixer and ask for a new patch with tests.
[05:41:06] <mikesherov> sure
[05:41:15] <mikesherov> but I don't personally see how building up a test suite could ever bring in more regressions.
[05:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> Though we should probably add a test for the floating bug before asking him for tests for his fixes.
[05:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> Building up the test suite isn't what's going to cause regressions.
[05:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's making a change and testing for that bug fix without knowing about all the other use cases that we're supporting.
[05:41:57] <mikesherov> yup
[05:42:07] <scott_gonzalez> So if this guy had submitted tests with his 3 fixes, they would've all passed, and we'd still have a regression.
[05:42:08] <mikesherov> makes sense
[05:42:23] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: sure, but we'd be in the same place anyway
[05:42:42] <mikesherov> I mean, we'd be in the position now for BlazeCell to fix it again with tests
[05:42:48] <mikesherov> and then both cases are covered.
[05:42:55] <scott_gonzalez> Right, which unfortunately means long term stable, sort term unstable.
[05:43:16] <mikesherov> yup
[05:43:16] <mikesherov> that might be something we're willing to accept?
[05:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> As long as we're willing to act quickly on regressions.
[05:43:56] <mikesherov> I'm probably more aggressive than what you're used to :-)
[05:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:44:26] <scott_gonzalez> In the past, if I landed an interaction fix and it caused a regression, I'd immediately revert and inform the author of the fix.
[05:44:27] <mikesherov> I'm willing to deal with it for 2 reasons
[05:45:01] <mikesherov> 1. it'll create a test suite that serves as the basis for the rewrite
[05:45:20] <mikesherov> 2. it'll show the community that we're engaged in fixing these plugins through active contribution
[05:45:20] <mikesherov> '
[05:45:50] <mikesherov> I get the scope creep and focused efforts and whatnot
[05:46:06] <mikesherov> I'm saying, let me deal with the community, and the optics of that side of things
[05:46:17] <mikesherov> while you guys keep taking it block by block
[05:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:46:47] <mikesherov> and if it blows up in my face, well then, lesson learned
[05:46:50] <mikesherov> :-P
[05:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> So, 1.9 was supposed to be this magical thing that finally gave us time to spend some time on things that had gotten stale.
[05:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> But then I went and put a super tight timeline on 1.10 for Drupal.
[05:47:30] <mikesherov> isn't that always the case
[05:48:00] <mikesherov> you've made the right moves
[05:48:18] <mikesherov> we just need a multipronged approach now that we have the manpower again
[05:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:48:53] <mikesherov> like, menubar for exampleâ€¦ me fixing that doesn't really get us anything.
[05:49:09] <scott_gonzalez> No, I'd rather you focus on the released code.
[05:49:15] <mikesherov> right
[05:49:33] <mikesherov> on the roadmap, it says "clean up the pull request queue"
[05:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and kborchers_ are mostly on the unreleased side.
[05:49:50] <mikesherov> I've kind of just taken that without really asking for it :-)
[05:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> Plus Felix on selectmenu.
[05:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> And rxaviers will be there too once download builder dies down a bit.
[05:50:35] <mikesherov> great
[05:51:17] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm going to go through the 139 emails in my inbox now...
[05:51:20] <mikesherov> so, my approach is, if the contributor is active and responsive, and provides testsâ€¦ I'll land the fix. That's really the only way I'll learn the codebase tooâ€¦ seeing what they changed and why
[05:51:32] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:51:57] <mikesherov> that'll def cause a few regressions,so I'll bring it up at the meeting
[05:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:52:11] <mikesherov> just so everyone knows I'm actively going to break stuff :-)
[05:52:43] <mikesherov> anyway, g2g also. Thanks for filling me in

[05:59:45] <doesallmagic> * rxaviers: Deduce allComponents from release manifest (fix)
[05:59:46] <doesallmagic> * rxaviers: Update base fixture of ThemeRoller unit test to release 1.9.1
[06:00:45] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8806#comment:5 The old workaround can't be used anymore, but I think this should stay as wontfix.
[06:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> We used to use `.addClass( "ui-tabs-hide" )` and now we use `.hide()`. So there's not clean way for him to stop the `display: none;`.
[06:04:21] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez !important will still trump it http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/cwaA2/
[06:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: so clever.
[06:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if that breaks animations.
[06:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> I don't care if it does, but it'd be interesting.
[06:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Make sure to check milestones when landing pulls since we have them set based on the roadmap: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5295#comment:19
[06:45:02] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #92: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/92/
[07:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Hey, wanted to run something by you about http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/2208
[07:38:14] <petersendidit> yes
[07:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> I was thinking about this over the weekend (I didn't even realize that Mike had landed it at the time), and I was wondering when people actually do this.
[07:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> I know I told you it was legit and that you should implement it.
[07:39:18] <scott_gonzalez> For a long time we were trying to get parity between accordion and tabs.
[07:39:32] <scott_gonzalez> But we're actually pretty far away from that.
[07:39:37] <petersendidit> Disable individual panes in the accordion?
[07:39:56] <scott_gonzalez> Right, we already closed a ticket for that as wontfix, because we didn't know of use cases.
[07:40:18] <petersendidit> ok
[07:40:27] <scott_gonzalez> And we have different ARIA handling between them (even though they're semantically equivalent).
[07:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> And we use delayed activations on tabs, but not accordions.
[07:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to think of when accordions are used with dynamic panels.
[07:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> So far I've only thought of something like mail clients where each account is in a panel.
[07:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> But those are individually collapsible panels, not an accordion with a single open panel.
[07:42:01] <petersendidit> yea
[07:42:18] <scott_gonzalez> The thing that got me started thinking about this was that the other day I noticed the change is +.5kb
[07:42:32] <petersendidit> the refresh change?
[07:42:32] <scott_gonzalez> For something that probably very few people will use.
[07:42:34] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:42:49] <petersendidit> well the refresh change allows you to add remove panels
[07:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so I'm trying to figure out what existing sites/apps do this.
[07:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> I can't think of any.
[07:43:37] <petersendidit> I could see a accodion that is a wizard, and depending on what you choose you might need to add a few steps
[07:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> I think we've heard that for a few different things and we always say to build a wizard widget on top of accordion.
[07:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's a very specific use of accordion.
[07:44:41] <petersendidit> Yea
[07:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> One in which you can only move in specific directions.
[07:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> Also, accordions aren't the best interface for wizards.
[07:44:57] <petersendidit> yup
[07:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> I feel bad telling you to implement this and then questioning the value :-/
[07:45:27] <petersendidit> its all good
[07:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> In my head, I was still in "synchronize with tabs" mode
[07:45:46] <petersendidit> I like the idea of all of our widgets haveing a refresh method
[07:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm starting to think we need to abandon that thought.
[07:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> In reality, people do not use accordions and tabs in the same way.
[07:46:10] <petersendidit> yea
[07:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: In regards to all widgets haven't a refresh method, I'm not sure if all widgets make sense.
[07:47:16] <scott_gonzalez> For example, what would refreshing a dialog do?
[07:47:22] <petersendidit> true
[07:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> Or a progressbar.
[07:47:55] <petersendidit> I am suprized that it added that much
[07:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, how did I type "haven't" instead of "having"?
[07:48:04] <scott_gonzalez> Me too.
[07:48:16] <petersendidit> it was basily moving code around
[07:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> Let me run this again, the source number was huge.
[07:50:17] <petersendidit> no it went up a good chunk
[07:50:25] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...maybe it was a rebasing issue or something.
[07:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting +127 on the commit in master.
[07:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> That's not so bad.
[07:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> +1126 in source, which is still kind of surprising.
[07:51:22] <petersendidit> The big part that got added was the logic to figure out the new state of things and handle it correctly
[07:51:26] <scott_gonzalez> But +127 min+gzip isn't nearly as bad the >500 that I saw the other day.
[07:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> I think it was probably because I was comparing your branch to master and master had changed.
[07:52:07] <scott_gonzalez> There was probably stuff removed in master that still existed in your branch.
[07:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, for +127 I say we'll keep it :-)
[07:52:31] <petersendidit> ok
[07:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[07:52:38] <petersendidit> ;-)
[07:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Did you see that I added the style check to domEqual()?
[07:54:28] <petersendidit> yes
[07:54:32] <petersendidit> good stuff
[07:54:42] <scott_gonzalez> And now we've got a bug to fix in accordion in IE8 :-/ http://swarm.jquery.org/result/442882
[07:54:50] <petersendidit> hehe
[07:55:01] <scott_gonzalez> I love how a single browser has a style issue.
[07:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> errr...IE7.
[07:56:11] <petersendidit> overflow visible vs scroll really? weird
[07:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:57:20] <petersendidit> I kinda think we need a async domEqual
[07:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> We could do that.
[07:57:41] <petersendidit> check what the dom is now, do some of the ajax stuff in tabs, then compaire
[07:58:03] <petersendidit> because the tabs logic around the ajax stuff adds/removes classes attributes
[07:58:06] <scott_gonzalez> We can do the lovely `if ( modifier.length )` test and pass a callback to the modifier function.
[07:58:50] <scott_gonzalez> Let me test that out.
[08:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> Huh, for some reason we're passing a jQuery object to the modifier.
[08:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> We don't use that anywhere, so I'm going to remove it.
[08:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> I can see why it was done, but no point in refactoring all the uses of it.
[08:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/ebfa845d657d3174471e
[08:08:25] <petersendidit> nice
[08:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> We should really beef up our domEqual() tests.
[08:09:03] <petersendidit> yes
[08:09:18] <scott_gonzalez> While testing this I noticed that even just doing $( "#tabs2" ).tabs().tabs( "destroy" ) fails the test.
[08:09:44] <petersendidit> what causes the fail?
[08:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> aria-controls on the custom id.
[08:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like .data() isn't being cleared.

[08:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nevermind.

[10:29:15] <jzaefferer> pinged Felix about the lint failure
[10:29:31] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez mikesherov: I lost my IRC backlog - what did I miss today?
[10:31:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez mikesherov: while the travis output is a little annoying to parse (I want the last section at the top), its pretty useful here: https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/546 - will the mergatron integration look similar?
[10:32:04] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: it'll be the jenkins output
[10:32:31] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: and then what it can do on top of that is comment on the PR inline for violationsâ€¦ but that needs to be built up
[10:33:03] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: makes sense, thanks. Would be nice to output the interesting lines in a comment.
[10:33:33] <mikesherov> mergeatron parses the jenkins output, so that's definitely a possibility
[10:54:37] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what's your status on download builder? Do you need input somewhere?
[10:54:54] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Im working here https://gist.github.com/4038528

[12:09:27] <rxaviers> ops
[12:09:31] <rxaviers> 5days
[12:09:34] <jzaefferer> ah :-)
[12:09:37] <rxaviers> sorry
[12:09:38] <rxaviers> kk
[12:09:55] <rxaviers> let me fix that
[12:10:02] <jzaefferer> also brake != break
[12:10:56] <jzaefferer> 1h for "show multiple versions" seems optimistic. Will likely need more than one iteration
[12:11:22] <jzaefferer> otherwise looking good. Looking forward to having multi version support next week ;)
[12:13:03] <rxaviers> yeah! We'll probably have more than one iteration in other places too. So, that plan will be a v0 for multi version.
[12:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: When multiple version support lands, it'll still support having just one version listed, right?
[12:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> Multiple version support will hopefully land before 1.9.2.
[12:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> And when we release 1.9.2, we'll still only be showing one version.
[12:17:33] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, yeap, it will!
[12:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> great :-)
[12:17:48] <rxaviers> :)
[12:19:16] <rxaviers> Im willing to make DB more consistent on that change
[12:19:59] <rxaviers> the error handling is better, and `grunt prepare` is better
[13:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? petersendidit: The accordion failure is such a mess.
[13:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> This is the cause of the bug: $( this ).height()
[13:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> How does that possibly change the overflow?
[13:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin mikesherov: ^
[13:12:56] <mikesherov> Never use .height() when you mean .css(height);
[13:14:57] <petersendidit> Because IE7 is magical
[13:15:21] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: I think I can recreate the problem on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8809
[13:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Well, the fiddle shows the problem, I just want him to reduce it even more.
[13:15:56] <petersendidit> ok
[13:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, it should be marked valid, but it really needs a better description.
[13:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: So I should change this to .css( "height" ) ?
[13:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.accordion.js#L345-352
[13:19:04] <mikesherov> I dunno. Sorry, busy at the moment actually. Will check shortly
[13:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:48:17] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! I thought you showed me something at summit regarding a note on how to attach event handlers... in the ui docs or the api docs... But I cannot find it again! Did I dream this? Thanks :-)

[21:02:40] <MrMister> Any thought on the right approach to handling top-level links in the menubar plugin?  There are a few notes on the wiki about it, but no formal tickets or discussion that I can find
