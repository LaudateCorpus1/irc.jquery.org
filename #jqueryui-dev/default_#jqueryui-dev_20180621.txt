[01:22:24] <user_kevin> jQuery-ui draggable cursor style doesnâ€™t work currectly in Chrome. You can test it by opening this url https://jqueryui.com/draggable/#cursor-style in your chrome browser
[01:28:55] <user_kevin> the first element doesnâ€™t show a move cursor in chrome windows
[01:28:56] <user_kevin> [1:25pm] user_kevin: and the second element should have a crosshair cursor
[01:28:56] <user_kevin> [1:26pm] user_kevin: Anyone know how to make the draggable work correctly about the cursor style?
