[03:30:36] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez kborchers, from Hans: "I did a JAWS test with the updated menu. I didn't find any issues, the markup looks good, the labeling is correct and focus is tracked properly. JAWS announces the menu correctly."

[05:33:47] <jzaefferer> kborchers: yep :-)
[05:34:04] <jzaefferer> Scott wanted to do another units review, pending that Menu should be pretty much done
[05:34:14] <jzaefferer> I'm also almost done with a first pass of 1.9 API docs
[05:34:22] <kborchers> nice!
[05:34:31] <jzaefferer> Forgot to add the destroy method pretty much everywhere
[05:34:57] <kborchers> yeah, another site of eyes on the menu units would be good. according to jscoverage i got it to 96% coverage
[05:36:35] <jzaefferer> The percentage itself is of little use. But the info that the letter-typing had no test was useful.

[05:57:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers: This is music to my ears :-) I'm hoping to spend most of my time on sites this week, but I'll be looking at menu very soon.
[05:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: What makes you think that tabs supports a selector for the active option?
[05:58:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: line 455
[05:59:02] <jzaefferer> 454-456
[05:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ah yes, that's not a real selector though.
[05:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> That's a URL.
[05:59:35] <scott_gonzalez> The active option happens to go through there, but we shouldn't document that.
[05:59:50] <jzaefferer> okay, so just an implementation detail?
[06:00:45] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...actually, we might be able to drop that now.
[06:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> It was there for old APIs.
[06:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> See _getIndex() right below.
[06:01:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'll see if the selector code in _findActive() is still used anywhere.
[06:02:48] <jzaefferer> okay
[06:02:59] <jzaefferer> docs only mention numeric index anyway
[06:03:15] <jzaefferer> I'm now on datepicker docs..............
[06:03:38] <jzaefferer> "The localization files are also available in the UI svn: http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ui/i18n/" m(
[06:03:51] <scott_gonzalez> haha

[06:05:40] <jzaefferer> Figured we'd rather start from scratch and add back an FAQ if we ever need it again

[07:36:47] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Tabs: Simplify _findActive() now that hrefs are never used.
[07:39:59] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'm trying to deploy api.jqueryui.com locally, getting this error:
[07:40:06] <jzaefferer> >> Error processing category uncategorized.
[07:40:06] <jzaefferer> >> Error: XML-RPC fault: A term with the name provided already exists with this parent.
[07:40:06] <jzaefferer> <WARN> Task "wordpress-sync" failed. Use --force to continue. </WARN>
[07:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> Indeed.
[07:40:27] <scott_gonzalez> Change the slug to Uncategorized (uppercase).
[07:40:39] <scott_gonzalez> That's one of the things I'm going to discuss with nacin.
[07:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> We know the cause of the problem.
[07:40:49] <nacin> howdy
[07:41:03] <jzaefferer> I don't know where the uncategorized is coming from in the first place
[07:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's the jquery-slugs plugin that lets you have captial letters in the slugs.
[07:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> If you have that enabled before creating the site, then the slug is different.
[07:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably in the XSLT or grunt.
[07:41:59] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Ready to simplify multi-site and web-base-template?
[07:42:11] <jzaefferer> all 27 entries have <category slug="utilities"/>
[07:42:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's in taxonomies.json
[07:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> The category data isn't generated from the entries, it's generated from something else.
[07:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if that's still using XML or not.
[07:43:14] <jzaefferer> {"name":"Uncategorized","slug":"uncategorized"}
[07:43:16] <jzaefferer> uhm?
[07:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> But the built data is in taxonomies.json
[07:43:25] <nacin> let me just fix the slugs plugin.
[07:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, change that slug to Uncategorized.
[07:45:50] <jzaefferer> so categories.xml is what I needed to update
[07:46:11] <jzaefferer> Creating posts worked, then it failed with:
[07:46:12] <jzaefferer> >> Error getting resources from WordPress.
[07:46:12] <jzaefferer> >> Error: XML-RPC fault: server error. requested method gw.getResources does not exist.

[07:46:28] <jzaefferer> I've npm-install'ed and pulled latest wordpress
[07:47:28] <jzaefferer> Can we disable the wordpress feature that converts newlines to paragraphs?
[07:48:33] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You're using web-base-template?
[07:48:44] <jzaefferer> Yeah, lemme update that, too
[07:48:57] <scott_gonzalez> There's where gw.getResources is defined.
[07:49:10] <jzaefferer> works0rs
[07:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> I really need to release a new version of grunt-wordpress.
[07:49:21] <scott_gonzalez> The new version checks for stuff like this up front.
[07:49:37] <jzaefferer> okay
[07:49:39] <scott_gonzalez> It will also let you know if web-base-template and grunt-wordpress are out-of-sync :-)
[07:50:00] <jzaefferer> so, is there a way to enable the specific ui api theme for a local multisite?
[07:50:23] <jzaefferer> I did some theme hacking before, do we have something better now?
[07:50:26] <scott_gonzalez> Log in and change the theme :-P
[07:51:01] <jzaefferer> available themes: jqueryui-com and plugins-jquery-com
[07:51:13] <jzaefferer> why no api-jqueryui-com?
[07:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> You should have a lot of themes.
[07:51:24] <nacin> jzaefferer: did you set up a multisite instance?
[07:51:32] <jzaefferer> nacin: yep
[07:51:53] <nacin> jzaefferer: wp-admin/network/themes.php
[07:52:04] <jzaefferer> that's what I'm looking at
[07:52:13] <jzaefferer> well, after Scott mentioned changing the theme...
[07:52:35] <jzaefferer> even choosing the ui theme doesn't give me the ui theme
[07:53:08] <jzaefferer> whatever, not that big a deal for now
[07:53:12] <jzaefferer> nacin: Can we disable the wordpress feature that converts newlines to paragraphs?
[07:53:12] <nacin> wp-admin/network/themes.php is for making a theme available to all the other sites on the network. you'd have to go to wp-admin/themes.php to activate it.
[07:53:27] <nacin> jzaefferer: not a problem if that's what scott_gonzalez, rdworth etc want.
[07:53:44] <scott_gonzalez> That's probably fine.
[07:53:46] <jzaefferer> at least on api.jqueryui.com its not useful at all
[07:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> We'll be writing in markdown or HTML anyway.
[07:54:22] <nacin> There may be some sites that are 100% managed through WP, yes?
[07:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ?
[07:54:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure we'll actually end up with any.
[07:55:22] <scott_gonzalez> Can we control it per site?
[07:55:47] <nacin> That's what I'd do.
[07:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:56:27] <jzaefferer> nacin: so, can I test that setting locally?
[07:56:59] <nacin> sure, give me a few minutes to push something into web-base-template
[07:59:44] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:00:10] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez nacin: on qunitjs.com I currently get this error:
[08:00:11] <jzaefferer> >> Error publishing index.html.
[08:00:11] <jzaefferer> >> Error: XML-RPC fault: Invalid file type
[08:00:16] <jzaefferer> are you aware of that?
[08:00:23] <jzaefferer> probably about the resources upload?
[08:00:33] <nacin> One more thing for the list.
[08:00:35] <rworth> I don't think we haven't a current goal for any sites to be managed through WP, no
[08:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: rworth has that problem too, but I don't.
[08:01:15] <rworth> yeah
[08:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> .html is listed as a valid file type in WP.
[08:01:25] <nacin> Not always.
[08:01:27] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: are you using latest grunt/wordpress modules?
[08:02:00] <nacin> .html is insecure as it allows someone to upload XSS. so is .txt when IE does it's lovely browser-sniffing.
[08:02:09] <nacin> we don't actually ban .txt, but it's been considered.
[08:02:18] <nacin> We can cover this today.
[08:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I'm ready when you are.

[09:07:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez nacin: Still looking for answers on turning off the new-line conversion and fixing qunitjs.com deploy (.html being invalid)
[09:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: new-line conversion should be disabled in web-base-template if you update.
[09:26:03] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like .html might be fixed as well.
[09:27:16] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: supposedly, yes.
[09:29:15] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez nacin: nice, both fixed. QUnit site still has no content here, trying to figure out whats missing...
[09:29:39] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I can help you with that.
[09:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> Let's get on Skype and you can show me what's going on.
[09:31:39] <jzaefferer> looks like its not deploying anything
[11:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: What do you think about a method like .uniqueId() which will generate an id if the element doesn't already have one?
[11:47:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: first question would be is this in general or for a specific widget? second would be, why does the element need an id?
[11:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> general, in ui core
[11:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> Because ARIA has an obsession with ids.
[11:48:18] <scott_gonzalez> You generate an id for every menu and every menu item.
[11:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> Dialogs generate ids for titlebars.
[11:49:11] <scott_gonzalez> Tabs is going to generate ids for everything: tabs, anchors, and panels.
[11:49:19] <kborchers> right, right. yeah, that probably makes sense then to pull that out rather than repeating similar code
[11:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> We could just call .uniqueId() and then know that the element has an idea.
[11:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> s/idea/id/
[11:49:52] <kborchers> yep, makes sense to me
[11:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> Then in _destroy() we can call .removeUniqueId()
[11:50:08] <scott_gonzalez> And it'll figure out whether the id was generated.
[11:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably just use "ui-id-X" where X auto-increments.
[11:50:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmm, the destroy piece makes me nervous. what if someone uses a similar id style. we don't want to remove something we didn't create
[11:51:43] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we need to remove the ids in destroy regardless of whether this is generalized.
[11:51:57] <kborchers> which makes me re-think the removal of id's that is happening in menu now
[11:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's safe to claim /^ui-id-\d+$/
[11:52:40] <kborchers> yeah, i guess that's specific enough if we document that is what we are using so don't use it or you'll lose your id's
[11:53:38] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll wait and see if jzaefferer or rworth have any thoughts on this before I add it.
[11:54:26] <kborchers> sounds good ... looking at menu now, it just rips out the id of every anchor in the menu during destroy, no matter where it came from. probably not good but this would solve that
[11:55:47] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:56:02] <scott_gonzalez> Does menu have a destroy test?
[11:56:16] <kborchers> i believe so
[11:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...it does
[11:56:37] <kborchers> probably doesn't have an existing id on an anchor
[11:56:43] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[11:56:48] <scott_gonzalez> probably true
[11:56:58] <scott_gonzalez> Mostly seems like an edge case.
[11:57:08] <kborchers> yeah, but still not completely unlikely
[11:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, people will do it for custom functionality and styling.
[11:57:23] <kborchers> right
[11:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of destroy....
[11:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> I should go track down the failures in IE that popped up when I improved domEqual()
[11:58:51] <kborchers> failures? i haven't seen them. did you remove something to get the tests to pass?
[12:00:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/162
[12:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> I added a whole bunch of props to check for in domEqual()
[12:00:53] <scott_gonzalez> Tabs and menu both started failing in IE when I did that.
[12:01:23] <kborchers> i see
[12:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like maybe menu doesn't remove aria-disabled on destroy
[12:02:31] <kborchers> woops
[12:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...but it passes in other browsers.
[12:03:10] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe they don't get parsed as properties in other browsers.
[12:03:27] <kborchers> i love different browser implementations. makes things so much more fun
[12:04:02] <kborchers> especially ie<9
[12:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> bah
[12:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> .prop( "aria-controls" ) !== .attr( "aria-controls" )
[12:05:51] <scott_gonzalez> I was hoping I could just use .prop() for everything in the test.
[12:06:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure that works for "normal" attributes.
[12:06:27] <kborchers> ah
[12:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I'll update this, and then we'll probably have failures EVERYWHERE!
[12:07:16] <kborchers> sounds about right
[12:07:34] <kborchers> fails everywhere except ie<9
[12:07:37] <kborchers> :)
[12:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> YAY! Fails in Chrome now.

[13:13:38] <scott_gonzalez> So many in like 100 years we can start writing sane code.
[13:14:27] <scott_gonzalez> Official reason for async behavior: unknown
[13:16:34] <jzaefferer> oh god
[13:17:28] <kborchers> thanks Microsoft!
[13:17:36] * kborchers grumbles and walks away
[13:24:32] <jzaefferer> nacin scott_gonzalez: any news on resource redirects? that and code highlighting are the two blockers for qunitjs.com
[13:25:29] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I was waiting for nacin to finish the multi-site automation before working on resource redirects.
[13:25:44] <nacin> what's the deal with the resource redirects?
[13:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> We want to rewrite /resources/foo to /wp-content/gw-resources/HTTP_HOST/foo
[13:26:54] <jzaefferer> exactly :-)
[13:27:25] <nacin> you mean web-base-template/gw-resources?
[13:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose so :-)
[13:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'll go ahead and impement .uniqueId() in core, unless you have some idea of how we would ever get rid of core.
[13:31:52] <jzaefferer> well, we could at least not add more to it
[13:32:08] <jzaefferer> but no, I don't
[13:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> That would mean never creating things that we think should live in core.
[13:32:54] <scott_gonzalez> core = jQuery
[13:33:31] <scott_gonzalez> Or creating lots of small dependencies.
[13:34:35] <jzaefferer> Not today
[13:36:41] <jzaefferer> nacin: Whereever static resources get uploaded when I run `grunt deploy`
[13:37:00] <nacin> I guess that's up to scott_gonzalez, then.
[13:37:31] <nacin> I'll work out something and let you know of the location for the deploy
[13:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: It's already defined :-)
[13:40:26] <scott_gonzalez> define( 'GW_RESOURCE_DIR', WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/gw-resources/' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] );
[13:40:44] <scott_gonzalez> but as you pointed out WP_CONTENT_DIR will actually be web-base-template
[13:42:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: added destroy and widget methods to the Widget page
[13:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> oh right :-)
[13:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> There are probably some patterns that should be documented to.
[13:42:54] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't spend much time thinking about it.
[13:43:01] <scott_gonzalez> I really just wanted to document show/hide.
[13:43:10] <jzaefferer> patterns?
[13:43:57] <scott_gonzalez> For example, if you need to position an element, use .position().
[13:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> Expose the position option, default the values, and then use $.extend() to set the element.
[13:47:58] <jzaefferer> right, default to option to element, but allow that to be overriden

[14:16:03] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from BrianJGraham: Any time I use @jquery or @jqueryui it's nothing but rage: http://t.co/tyooYiKL ★ http://bit.ly/KrUBLH
[17:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> He can go rage himself to death.
[17:11:18] <kborchers> lol
[17:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> Seriously, who cares if an element that didn't have an id suddenly has an id?
[17:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> Why is he raging about that?
[17:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> In other news, it took Twitter 2 years to figure out that doing everything on the client was a bad idea.
[17:14:20] <kborchers> heh
[17:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/05/improving-performance-on-twittercom.html
[17:14:35] <kborchers> read that earlier today
[17:14:38] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[17:14:57] <scott_gonzalez> It's like nobody did any thinking before this.
[17:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> "When we shipped #NewTwitter in September 2010, we built it around a web application architecture that pushed all of the UI rendering and logic to JavaScript running on our users’ browsers and consumed the Twitter REST API directly, in a similar way to our mobile clients. That architecture broke new ground by offering a number of advantages over a more traditional approach, but it lacked support for various optimizations available only on 
[17:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> What new grounds were broken?
[17:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> Please, tell me.
[17:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> Unless the ground-breaking amazingness was how unbelievably unresponsive the pages were.
[17:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> Or how their URLs were a new level of brokenness thanks to hashbangs.
[17:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea what they thought was new.
[17:25:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hey, so are you working on .uniqueId() or do you want me to take a stab at it tonight? or is there anything else that needs work? i've got some free hours tonight
[17:27:22] <scott_gonzalez> I've got it locally.
[17:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> But if you want to use it in menu and land it, you can do that.
[17:28:20] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/5b4ab0322397aee95260
[17:28:39] <scott_gonzalez> I wrote it earlier, but didn't get to the point where I was going to use it yet :-P
[17:29:11] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to use it with menu and see if it works.
[17:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> It'll need tests and a ticket.
[17:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be good to know that it actually works somewhere :-)
[17:29:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, i'll get that worked in
[17:32:10] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you mean an enhancement ticket?
[17:32:17] <kborchers> in bugs
[17:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[17:32:58] <kborchers> ok, will do
[17:51:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: this look ok? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8361
[18:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[18:21:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: for this menu test, is this good enough to test that the id has been generated since i'm not always sure what the number will be?
[18:21:31] <kborchers> equal( menu.attr("aria-activedescendant").substr( 0, 6 ), "ui-id-", "aria attribute, generated id");
[18:21:45] <kborchers> in the aria tests
[18:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> I've got this in tabs: ok( /^ui-tabs-\d+$/.test( tabs.eq( 2 ).attr( "aria-controls" ) ), "generated id" );
[18:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> A bit more strict about the validation, but essentially the same.
[18:23:19] <kborchers> ok, i'll change to your way since it looks fancier :P
[18:23:44] <scott_gonzalez> heh
