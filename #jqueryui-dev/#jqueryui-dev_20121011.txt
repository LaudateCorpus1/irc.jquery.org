[06:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> The file exists.
[06:34:21] <nacin> nope, but can look.
[06:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks. Not sure if there's some rewrite in nginx.
[06:38:33] <scott_gonzalez> Works fine for me locally.
[06:39:41] <nacin> Definitely nginx.

[12:05:40] <_zoggy_> http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/10/firefox-16-vulnerability-attack-code-available-online/
[12:06:00] <_zoggy_> As previously reported, Mozilla officials took the unusual step of temporarily removing Firefox 16 on Wednesday, just one day after its release. Company officials warned that a security hole introduced in the release "could allow a malicious site to potentially determine which websites users have visited and have access to the URL or URL parameters." They went on to say there was no
[12:06:01] <_zoggy_> evidence the vulnerability was being exploited by real-world attackers.
[12:06:06] <_zoggy_> ha
[12:09:18] <_zoggy_> The major performance improvement in Firefox 16 is the introduction of incremental garbage collection. Firefox's JavaScript engine previously collected memory from scripts that were no longer running in big, long-running blocks; now it performs the culling in smaller segments to avoid a performance hit.
[12:09:30] <_zoggy_> wonder if that causes any issues for jquery stuff
[12:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ping
[12:55:42] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i'm getting a PR ready for the UI AUTHORS.txt based on CLA responses where they changed their name or email ... for core I just changed the name to what they gave, including middle name if they gave it
[12:55:45] <DaveMethvin> do you want to do the same?
[12:55:58] <DaveMethvin> i figure they knew their name better than me
[12:56:07] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[12:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully the last name in the list doesn't need to be updated.
[12:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> I have the release script stop if the last name doesn't match the last name from `grunt authors` :-P
[12:57:06] <DaveMethvin> i will guard against that :D
[13:05:52] <gnarf> sup
[13:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/12
[13:06:57] <gnarf> hrm
[13:10:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: this is a tricky one
[13:11:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no time to fix it now, will try later tonight
[13:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What's the problem?
[13:12:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: posted short explaination on the issue
[13:13:17] <gnarf> basically .php$ wins over /resources/
[13:13:29] <gnarf> and the alias doesn't happen
[13:13:59] <gnarf> gotta run tho
[13:15:31] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[13:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:20:30] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: you dodged a bullet there, the last name is Rafael Xavier de Souza
[13:20:37] <DaveMethvin> no accents anywhere
[13:20:45] <DaveMethvin> and i looked all over the internets :D
[13:20:48] <scott_gonzalez> heh

[13:55:09] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: One of the few commits that I actually merged instead of cherry-picking!
[13:55:45] <DaveMethvin> what about unit tests? oh no!
[13:56:17] <scott_gonzalez> equal( authors.splice( 25, 1 ), "..." )
[13:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: People can puke a little bit less now because I updated the demo list on jqueryui.com.
[13:57:15] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks to Krinkle|detached for the suggested styling.
[13:57:36] <DaveMethvin> now i'm on to mobile's authors
[13:58:01] <scott_gonzalez> I think we need CSS animations that changes the background color to all the colors of the rainbow.
[13:58:41] <DaveMethvin> Welcome to jqueryui.com. Please choose your background color before downloading:
[13:58:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would work
[14:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> Time for round 2 of email bombing...
[14:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> 161 this time...
[14:02:46] <DaveMethvin> YOU MUST ANSWER

[14:03:13] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Update AUTHORS.txt based on CLA responses.
[14:04:30] <DaveMethvin> man that IE8 is really sensitive to author names
[14:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> OH CRAP
[14:18:30] <scott_gonzalez> umm...161 just turned into a unknown large number.
[14:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently deleting a milestone updates all tickets associated with that milestone.
[14:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> Which it doesn't do if you delete other things like components.
[14:19:06] <scott_gonzalez> There were probably hundreds of closed TBD tickets.
[14:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> UHOH, I think that just broke a bunch of tickets.
[14:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5727
[14:21:09] <scott_gonzalez> That's annoying because that one wasn't even TBD anymore.
[14:21:12] <scott_gonzalez> I had updated it to 2.0.0.
[14:21:40] <scott_gonzalez> ...and now it suddenly works.
[14:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> Why is Trac so crazy?
[14:24:39] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: NO U
[14:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> This is so painful to go through all these emails.
[14:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> I have to open every single one just in case someone replies to a ticket in the middle of this.
[14:25:19] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what is this, alphabetical sorting with random exceptions? http://bassistance.de/i/66b3bb.png
[14:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> Which happens every single time.
[14:25:41] <jzaefferer> I guess it sorts by filename, not label
[14:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: haha, that's possible.
[14:25:57] <scott_gonzalez> You can fix the grunt task.
[14:26:36] <jzaefferer> I've got a looong flight ahead of me
[14:26:41] <jzaefferer> And plenty up-to-date repos
[14:26:59] <jzaefferer> Will figure out how much I can actually do offline
[14:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> That's always a fun task before leaving for a trip.
[14:27:29] <jzaefferer> Time to catch some sleep first
[14:27:38] <scott_gonzalez> later
[14:35:00] <scott_gonzalez> And we're down to exactly 800 tickets :-)
[15:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> damn, the emails are still rolling in...
[15:39:09] <scott_gonzalez> Deleting the TBD milestone may be the worst thing I've ever done.

[19:10:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: around? just curious as to what causes jqueryui.com to be published before i push anything to master
[19:11:27] <kborchers> gnarf: ^^
[19:21:16] <gnarf> tagging it
[19:21:23] <gnarf> pushing to master deploys to stage
[19:21:32] <kborchers> ok, cool
[19:21:37] <kborchers> thanks
[19:21:38] <gnarf> tagging it with a version tag deploys it
[19:22:09] <kborchers> just wanted to make sure a change wouldn't be deployed without someone else seeing it first … i thought that's how it worked but wanted to make sure
[20:29:58] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, http://jqueryui.com/spinner/#currency still needs its title fixed
[20:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/77568347cf0a063ee905364dbe32268ab80d6edd
[20:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> We can't fix the site until 1.9.1.
[20:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> The demos are the 1.9.0 demos.
[20:44:08] <_zoggy_> ok
[20:44:15] <_zoggy_> i saw that you changed the demo li style
[20:44:30] <_zoggy_> but i guess that changing the site is ok.. as long as its not the actual demos
[20:45:39] <_zoggy_> can we invert the li styling? make the normal bg white but the selected gray?
[20:46:26] <_zoggy_> note on, http://jqueryui.com/menu/
[20:46:50] <_zoggy_> not sure if you wanna fix 'Meny Demo: Top-aligned Menu'
[20:46:59] <_zoggy_> not sure if you wanna fix 'Menu Demo: Top-aligned Menu'
[20:47:08] <_zoggy_> 'Menu Demo: ' could be dropped
[20:47:44] <_zoggy_> http://jqueryui.com/slider/#hotelrooms -- title is wrong as well
[20:59:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll go through all the demos and check the titles.
[21:31:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: http://cl.ly/image/0M3p0r07041y or http://cl.ly/image/3j1g2y3n3Z0W or http://cl.ly/image/331x323f393u
[21:32:48] <scott_gonzalez> #2
[21:33:17] <kborchers> ok
[21:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I assume people won't be downloading jQuery UI on their phone :-P
[21:35:37] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: probably not :) but it should still look good ;)
[21:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, just saying why I didn't choose #3.
[21:35:59] <kborchers> oh, right. makes sense
