[06:25:12] <ldeluca> morning!  hi gabriel_schulhof  saw your comment to my pull request.  What do we do from here?  I'm assuming we need to either update the test case or change the solution to get the focus on the popup
[06:25:28] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: We should change the test.
[06:25:44] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I was thinking: Add an input, give it focus, then open the popup, and make sure the input has been blurred.
[06:26:01] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Morning!
[06:26:40] <ldeluca> I don't think I'm allowed to touch the tests because of the license agreement for my company
[06:27:14] <ldeluca> nevermind, sounds like it's just demos and docs

[06:27:44] <ldeluca> alright, i'll look into updating that test case today then with your suggestion
[06:28:04] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: OK.
[06:29:26] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: BTW: What's your time zone?
[06:30:00] <ldeluca> EST. I'm in baltimore
[06:30:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool.
[06:30:14] <ldeluca> u?
[06:30:29] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Eastern European. I'm in Espoo, Finland.
[06:30:53] <ldeluca> wow, that's craziness.  So what time is it there?
[06:31:04] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: 16:31
[06:31:47] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm used to it. I work in the afternoons a lot, because that's when the New World wakes up :)
[06:32:04] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and speaking of the New World ...
[06:32:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Pong!
[06:33:16] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hey
[06:33:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You were up late! What transpired?
[06:34:47] <arschmitz> nothing im normally up then
[06:35:29] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so im going to update our jsbin template to this http://jsbin.com/jeqoroyuwero/3
[06:35:39] <arschmitz> then it will always work no matter what the link looks like
[06:36:09] <arschmitz> but im waiting to hear back about something 
[06:37:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, but if it does end up as our template, please add a comment telling people why that code is there.
[06:37:26] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/kijeja/1/edit
[06:37:32] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: already did
[06:38:09] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im trying to get us a vanity url
[06:38:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so like http://jsbin.com/jquery-mobile
[06:40:23] <gabriel_schulhof> WTF?! Did I just overwrite your URL?
[06:41:23] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. No, I didn't, but jsbin sure is confusing.
[06:41:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: How about something slightly more dramatic: http://jsbin.com/wevali/1/edit
[06:42:09] <arschmitz> lol i think that might be a bit much
[06:42:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, OK.
[06:42:36] <gabriel_schulhof> While we're add it we should also add a comment for the CSS.
[06:42:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Man! What's wrong with me. I'm becoming lysdexic.
[06:42:55] <arschmitz> yup
[06:43:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: at least neither the css nor the ajax setting would break anything unless the person is checking the requested with header them selves on the server
[06:43:50] <arschmitz> in which case i would think they should understand what this does
[06:44:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, you can't really retrieve something from another server, unless you set up that other server to send out the requisite access control header.
[06:45:12] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, if someone's doing cross-domain Ajax, I think they're well beyond getting tripped up by that bit of code :)
[06:46:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Maybe add some stars into the comment, just to be absolutely sure?
[06:47:50] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What about adding a reference to a, say, github-pages-hosted script called jsbin-workarounds.js that contains that code. That should make it obvious that it's jsbin-specific.
[06:56:09] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i dont know what your talking about with cross domain
[06:56:23] <arschmitz> this is just about the requested with header that says if the request is ajax or not
[06:56:55] <arschmitz> its generally only used by people who on the server want to serve different content based on if its ajax
[06:57:01] <arschmitz> which is what jsbin is doing
[06:57:37] <arschmitz> we even recommend it in our demos as a perf improvment and best way to use external toolbars panels etc.

[07:01:52] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: question on the tests.  I think I understand the structure of the test cases but this is my first time playing.  question for you
[07:01:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I was talking about people issuing cross-domain Ajax requests from a jsbin page.
[07:02:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i dont see what that has to do with this work around though?
[07:02:38] <ldeluca> there is the testHelper and I added the following: { 				blur: { src: $input, event: "blur.popupFocusedAfterOpen1" }, 				opened: { src: $popup, event: "popupafteropen.popupFocusedAfterOpen1" } 			},
[07:02:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: People doing stuff like that will have absolutely no problem noticing that we're futzing with the headers.
[07:03:11] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: is the blur.popupFocusedAfterOpen1 a method somewhere?  or it that just a label for the test?  
[07:03:15] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Don't use $something. Just call it something.
[07:03:52] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: .popupFocusedAfterOpen1 is a namespace for the event handler. It makes sure that when you detach the event handler, you detach the correct one.
[07:04:20] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I know the variables in the test use $something. Leave those. We'll change them when we have to.
[07:04:38] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Just don't add more like that.
[07:05:27] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: okay, let me rerun
[07:06:47] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I have to go AFK for a while. I should be back in about 3-4 hours.

[12:04:14] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Ping!
[12:04:32] <ldeluca> hey gabriel_schulhof
[12:04:51] <ldeluca> did you check out my test case and fix?
[12:04:55] <ldeluca> see anything I did wrong?
[12:05:00] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Hey! I would recommend that you .focus() the input, then expect the focus() and then open the popup.
[12:06:14] <ldeluca> so in the first function in the test case after I did textinput.focus(); have an ok() test on the focus?
[12:06:18] <ldeluca> is that how you'd do it?
[12:06:53] <ldeluca> are you on google talk or something?
[12:06:57] <ldeluca> might be easier to paste code :)
[12:08:06] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: function() { textinput.focus(); }, { focus: { src: textinput, event: "focus.popupFocusedAfterOpen0" } }, function( result ){ deepEqual( result.focus.timedOut, false ) }
[12:08:11] <ldeluca> function() { 				//first focus on the text input 				textinput.focus(); 			}, 			 			function( result ) { 				ok( !textinput.focus.timedOut, "textinput gained focus 'popupafteropen'" ); 				$popup.popup( "open" ); 			},
[12:08:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah :)
[12:09:01] <gabriel_schulhof> The same function that checks whether the text input was focused opens the popup.

[12:10:48] <ldeluca> how do you decide when to use a deepEqual vs. an ok?
[12:11:40] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Always use deepEqual :)
[12:12:00] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: The ok()s in there are on their way out. We replace them whenever we update a test.
[12:12:36] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: good to know :)
[12:13:05] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Yeah, we take the lazy approach with everything :)

[12:18:57] <ldeluca> hey, what do you guys use for IRC clients? 
[12:19:09] <ldeluca> i'm using webchat.freenode.net and i have to manually type out your names each time :)
[12:20:18] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I use irssi in a screen session.
[12:20:39] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: irssi is a console client, so you can use it with screen to stay logged in all the time.
[12:21:03] <ldeluca> not sure what "screen" is... unless you're just talking about a regular console window?
[12:21:25] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: screen is a UNIX command that will create a console inside your console window.
[12:21:48] <ldeluca> nice, let me look at irssi
[12:21:51] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Then, you run irssi inside the inner console, and then even if you close the window, irssi continues to run.
[12:21:59] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: You can later attach to it with screen -r.
[12:22:09] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: "r" as in "reattach".
[12:22:22] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: So, it's two apps working together.
[12:35:30] <ldeluca> grabriel_schulhof: stupid question, is the server name freenode.net?  
[12:38:31] <ldeluca> nevermind, found it
[13:04:48] <kborchers> ldeluca: if you're on OSX i recommend Textual
[13:04:56] <kborchers> for IRC
[13:08:06] <ldeluca_> kborchers: Thanks.  I downloaded limechat.  haven't looked into textual
[13:08:25] <ldeluca_> do you manually type out the people's names? ...that's what I've been doing
[13:08:33] <kborchers> ldeluca_: i used limechat for a while, prefer textual
[13:08:35] <ldeluca_> or is there some irc trick to get them to show up
[13:09:00] <kborchers> ldeluca_: nope, in textual (and most clients) you start typing and then tab complete
[13:09:04] <ldeluca_> kborchers: but textual is a whole $4.99... 
[13:09:13] <ldeluca_> kborchers: so cool!!!
[13:09:14] <kborchers> :)
[13:10:04] <ldeluca_> kborchers: advice for whoever maintains this page: http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/  it'd be nice to spell out exactly which server to use for irc novices like myself
[13:10:11] <ldeluca_> took a few tries to figure out it was irc.freenode.net
[13:11:10] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca_: https://github.com/jquery/irc.jquery.org/issues/new :)

[14:08:11] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that should be spelled out better here then http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/#commit-guidelines
[14:08:57] <kborchers> it kind of talks about them being equal which is what i was going off of
[14:09:14] <arschmitz> kborchers: yeah functionally they are
[14:09:22] <arschmitz> kborchers: its just the meaning we give them
[14:09:36] <kborchers> i'm saying if we want people to know that meaning we have to tell them
[14:09:49] <arschmitz> kborchers: yeah no we should be clear 
[14:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's not very clear there.
[14:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get that updated.
[14:10:47] <kborchers> thanks scott_gonzalez 
[14:11:39] <hlvwrk> is there any way to bring in the jquery mobile flip switch wihtout loading the entire mobile framework?
[14:12:32] <arschmitz> hlvwrk: thats really a question for #jquery but yes just use the custom download builder and pick just that and use it like you would a jquery ui widget
[14:12:57] <hlvwrk> ah perfect.
[14:12:58] <hlvwrk> Thank you!
