[07:54:27] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz: My colleague just got a Microsoft Surface Pro. I just had like 10min to play with it and noticed some weird JQM rendering.
[07:54:59] <agcolom> Do you have something equivalent already for testing? 
[07:55:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: what problem do you see?
[07:55:07] <agcolom> panels
[07:55:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I have a surface here (no pro)
[07:55:21] <arschmitz> agcolom: any specific pages i had a surface rt i just gave to uGoMobi and i have a laptop running 81 with a touch screen which is basicly the same
[07:55:21] <agcolom> panels on push just go too far
[07:55:54] <agcolom> and leave a blank space between the page and the panel
[07:56:25] <agcolom> One day next week when he brings it in and I have some time I'll take some screen shots
[07:56:39] <agcolom> The screen of this one is very wide
[07:56:41] <uGoMobi> agcolom: surface pro is running Windows 8
[07:56:51] <uGoMobi> so I wonder I can see it there too
[07:56:52] <agcolom> yes, this is 8.1
[07:57:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: i should be able to reproduce
[07:57:09] <arschmitz> im booting up now
[07:57:15] <uGoMobi> I still didn't install Windows 8
[07:57:20] <agcolom> ok. 
[07:57:34] <agcolom> Also the headers and footers look stretched 
[07:57:38] <uGoMobi> I can check on the Surface RT
[07:57:39] <agcolom> (the  text)
[07:58:33] <arschmitz> agcolom: the extra space on push i see
[07:58:39] <arschmitz> not sure about stretched text
[07:58:51] <uGoMobi> hope I can find the Surface because I packed it already
[07:58:57] <arschmitz> i see it on reveal too
[07:59:17] <arschmitz> id imagine this would show on browser stack
[07:59:17] <agcolom> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/toolbar/
[07:59:43] <agcolom> that's where the text on the toolbar looks stretched to the aspect ratio
[07:59:57] <agcolom> good that you can reproduce
[08:00:05] <agcolom> I'll play again next week
[08:00:12] <agcolom> have to go back to my students :-)
[08:00:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, thanks for reporting
[08:02:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the Surface RT uses a special charger :(
[08:02:15] <arschmitz> yup
[08:02:21] <arschmitz> i gave it to you with it
[08:02:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes you did
[08:02:31] <arschmitz> its magnetic 
[08:02:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but... it's an american plug
[08:02:39] <arschmitz> very similar to the macbook one
[08:02:39] <gseguin> mornin'
[08:02:42] <arschmitz> ohhh
[08:02:44] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin 
[08:07:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I'll buy a US-EU adapter plug, but I can't test now because the battery is empty
[08:08:07] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:09:17] <uGoMobi> I didn't notice it before because the pins of the adapter are hidden... you have to flip them out
[08:09:38] <arschmitz> yup
[08:37:27] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz: should I open a ticket or is there one already for this?

[09:01:08] <uGoMobi> new 1.4-stable is because some commits were not picked, not because of the version of course

[09:34:40] <uGoMobi> anyways... happy that this landed :)

[10:19:20] <manus> Hey jqueryuians, quick ilttle question of the day from me...
[10:20:03] <manus> is there any particular reasons for or against not extending widget options that are defined as `undefined` ?
[10:20:09] <manus> *are there
[10:20:39] <manus> for example, I define a new widget with options: { foo: undefined }
[10:21:06] <manus> when I instantiate the widget, I have empty this.options
[10:22:14] <manus> because of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widget.js#L87 and eventually https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widget.js#L162
[10:23:58] <manus> can a simple $.extend( true, {}, basePrototype.options ) be done instear, in order to keep the undefined properties as well?
[10:24:41] <manus> the gist is, I might want null and undefined to signify different things, but I want all the keys to be there in my options
[10:26:03] <manus> to, for example, have a fun _getCreateOptions that looks for all the default options in data-* attributes on the element
[10:26:58] <manus> are there specific reasons that a "deep" extend of the basePrototype options isn't done?
[10:28:30] <manus> if there are Reasons, that's fine too, I'd just want it documented somewhere that extended ui widget options defined as 'undefined' will not be available at all to the instance
[10:29:43] <manus> Feel free to reply here whenever, I'll check the logs later if I disconnect at some point. if this turns into a filed issue, just please also paste the link. Cheers!

[10:40:41] <arschmitz> gseguin: can you check out whats going on with coveralls
[10:40:58] <arschmitz> our coverage dropped by 33%
[10:42:10] <arschmitz> gseguin: the commit it dropped on in is very small so it must be something up it actually adds tests :|
[10:45:57] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'll double check
[11:12:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! Could you please have a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7243? It should be good to go.
[11:18:50] <_|Nix|_> So, I'm looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6574 ... I've tried installing the Windoze Phone 8.0 SDK to open a Cordova project for Windoze Phone, and the installation is failing. Do you guys have any experiencing installing the Windoze Phone 8 SDK?
[11:19:38] <_|Nix|_> Now, I'm downloading the installation ISO instead of the Web installer, but indications from the forums are that it will similarly fail :(
[11:26:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i swear i already approved that one lol 
[11:27:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: :)
[11:27:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks!
[11:27:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It'll be interesting to see how I cherry-pick this.

[11:35:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Here's another one that's been lingering around for a while: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7237
[11:36:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: have you tested this to make sure it works?
[11:39:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also i dont see any tests
[11:43:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You reviewed the original (#6811)
[11:43:48] <_|Nix|_>  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6811
[11:44:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just updated it, because the OP hasn't.
[11:44:47] <arschmitz> yeah it still needs tests and testing i had just done a quick once over and the OP never responded
[11:45:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, gotcha.
[11:45:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll update it then.
[11:45:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: TBH though, I'm not sure if the logic is that good though. Why would adding "//" depend on whether there's a hostname or not?
[11:46:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: absolute vs relative path
[11:47:18] <arschmitz> or full path rather
[11:48:10] <arschmitz> wait no never mind i misunderstood your question
[11:48:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure this is the right fix for the issue because i have not tested it yet i dont have a 4.4 device
[11:49:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not only that, but it also seems to only happen inside the WebView - meaning I need to install the Android SDK and make an app with Cordova :/
[11:49:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we need to find the cause of the logic issue that already exists that causes it to be //// 
[11:50:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think at the top of getLocation() we should deep-copy location and then overwrite host if it's absent.
[11:50:32] <_|Nix|_> ... and grab the host from the path.
[11:51:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll fix it right. *sigh*

[14:15:02] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell manus It's also pretty strange to treat null and undefined differently in a widget.
[14:15:02] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I’ll tell manus about that.
[14:24:58] <gseguin> wow TravisCI is way behind
[14:27:35] <gseguin> arschmitz: coverage is back to 80+ %
[14:33:53] <gseguin> uGoMobi: still there?
[14:34:03] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes
[14:34:45] <gseguin> uGoMobi: do you have time to review my CasperJS PR or would you rather arschmitz or _|Nix|_ to review it?
[14:34:52] <gseguin> it's not a code change
[14:38:36] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I am looking at it now, but I would like arschmitz or _|Nix|_ to look at it too because I am not really the best person to review this
[14:38:50] <gseguin> ok
[14:38:52] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I do see a typo in the commit message though 
[14:38:59] <gseguin> argh!
[14:39:01] <gseguin> ok
[14:39:03] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:39:40] <uGoMobi> gseguin: nice to have a test like this
[14:40:19] <gseguin> uGoMobi: and that is a very simple one, we can add more as we discover potential issues
[14:40:58] <gseguin> uGoMobi: We can even test the responsiveness as you can change the viewport size
[14:41:06] <uGoMobi> gseguin: looks like you accidently added line breaks in demos/jqm-contents.php
[14:41:17] <uGoMobi> gseguin: cool
[14:41:27] <gseguin> uGoMobi: it's not accidental
[14:41:44] <uGoMobi> gseguin: oh, what's the purpose of that?
[14:41:57] <gseguin> uGoMobi: The label (which I use as a selector) was containing leading spaces
[14:43:16] <uGoMobi> gseguin: are we talking about the same? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/092903bcf27983fc549cc77c6403f5523d59fa47/demos/jqm-contents.php#L8
[14:43:32] <gseguin> uGoMobi: indeed
[14:43:46] <gseguin> the way it was before was:
[14:44:05] <gseguin> \n                Checkboxradio widget
[14:44:39] <gseguin> So I could not do: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/092903bcf27983fc549cc77c6403f5523d59fa47/tests/casperjs/demos.test.js#L41
[14:44:55] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I don't see why there should be line breaks in there at all
[14:45:18] <gseguin> because of the way the markup was written
[14:45:25] <gseguin> it doesn't matter to the browser
[14:45:34] <gseguin> but it matters to CasperJS
[14:46:49] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok I understand that you had to change it, but why not change it to one line...
[14:46:50] <uGoMobi> <a href="#" class="ui-collapsible-heading-toggle ui-btn ui-btn-icon-right ui-btn-inherit ui-icon-carat-d">Checkboxradio widget<span class="ui-collapsible-heading-status"> click to expand contents</span></a>
[14:47:33] <gseguin> uGoMobi: to maintain a decent size line
[14:49:59] <uGoMobi> I see

[19:48:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: you around?
[19:48:59] <gseguin> I am
[19:49:08] <arschmitz> so iv been looking at your casper setup
[19:49:16] <gseguin> arschmitz: Travis ain't happy with that PR
[19:49:25] <arschmitz> yeah i saw
[19:49:58] <gseguin> that sucks
[19:50:04] <arschmitz> but what iv been thinking about is that it would be nice to have it be able to crawl the whole docs in an automated way
[19:50:29] <arschmitz> and check for errors ( missing resources / script and 404 )
[19:50:45] <arschmitz> iv seen a few different ways to do this
[19:50:59] <arschmitz> i saw a casper implementation
[19:51:01] <gseguin> with CasperJS?
[19:51:14] <arschmitz> but also seen a few other node projects to do it
[19:51:17] <gseguin> these tests are pretty basic
[19:51:27] <gseguin> but they catch what we missed last time
[19:51:47] <arschmitz> yeah im just thinking more complete testing might be nice so we know if something we do breaks a specific demo
[19:52:08] <gseguin> I agree, we can build on top of this
[19:52:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: iv been also looking at node-cralwer and flexible
[19:52:40] <gseguin> but first  I need to figure out why Travis is unhappy
[19:52:44] <arschmitz> that have built in crawling capability

[19:54:27] <arschmitz> gseguin: was just thinking it might be worth taking a quick look at these before committing to casper
[19:54:44] <gseguin> arschmitz: agreed
[19:55:01] <gseguin> I'll try to play with them in another branch
[19:55:08] <arschmitz> gseguin: here is the casper implementation http://planzero.org/blog/2013/03/07/spidering_the_web_with_casperjs
[19:57:00] <arschmitz> we would need to modify a bit but it looked like it could be a good way to go if the others are not better / easier
[19:59:05] <gseguin> But that doesn't test enhancement
[19:59:15] <gseguin> which is what I was going for 
[19:59:32] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah like a said a good starting point
[19:59:47] <gseguin> http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/php/#Apache-%2B-PHP seems like one way to get TravisCI going
[20:00:39] <arschmitz> gseguin: seems reasonable 
[20:01:09] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'll try to make it work over the weekend
[20:01:18] <gseguin> then I'll investigate the crawler
[20:01:25] <arschmitz> gseguin: cool not a super rush but great your working on it
[20:01:54] <gseguin> It bit us twice in the past so it's kind of on the top of my list
[20:02:16] <arschmitz> its been a lot more then twice i think sadly 
[20:02:30] <arschmitz> but twice recently
[20:03:00] <arschmitz> and yeah i agree this is important it will be great for development too make sure some change is not breaking demos
[20:03:24] <arschmitz> because even if its custom stuff in demos this is a good sign we would also be breaking code for other people
