[07:31:14] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: just noticed something weird with plugins site locally: http://swedberg.us/i/p-20120716-103034.jpg
[07:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yikes.
[07:31:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look into that today.
[07:32:04] <kswedberg> ok.
[07:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, I don't get that locally.
[07:32:49] <kswedberg> I'm going to push something to that repo in a bit. I added a couple functions for showing new plugins and recently updated plugins in the sidebar.
[07:32:59] <kswedberg> orly? maybe I messed something up. heh.
[07:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> cool :-)

[07:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you ran `grunt clean-all setup` and then ran the gist to populate, so I don't think you could've done anything wrong.
[07:34:32] <kswedberg> Also, the mockup has a list of "Popular Plugins." I have no idea how we're supposed to determine popularity, so I'm not gonna touch that for now.
[07:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: We won't have that for launch.
[07:35:13] <kswedberg> ok

[10:18:45] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: ^^^
[10:21:12] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, did I not push?
[10:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> shit
[10:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: vvv

[10:30:05] <jzaefferer> even better
[11:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> nacin|lunch: What's the process for adding a new site in the future?
[11:23:12] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: good question. adding it to the domains array then manually creating it, I guess
[11:23:55] <nacin> I can write a little routine to install the script
[11:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> This would obviously be low priority right now, but could we have a script that would look at the domains array and create any missing sites?
[11:24:03] <nacin> yep
[11:24:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'll create an issue for that. I'm sure we'll need it as some point.
[11:24:35] <nacin> should probably only happen if that site is actually hit but can't be found in the DB, that way it's kind of on-the-fly but without querying all the time
[11:24:49] <nacin> would not take me too long. an issue would be good.
[11:24:59] <nacin> I will dig in this week to the rewrite rule issue
[11:25:33] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[11:28:42] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm going to move the transfer effect into core.json and add all the metadata there.
[11:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> Then we should be good to merge into master, right?
[11:29:02] <jzaefferer> sounds good!

[11:40:00] <jasabella> um, what's a good css framework for jquery-ui that will size to the viewport?
[11:44:03] <nacin> danheberden: gnarfnoticing that the open file limits on jq01.jquery.com are still 1024
[11:45:25] <nacin> gnarf: ^
[11:52:43] <gnarf> nacin: yeah - its been the top thing on my list for a bit now
[11:52:52] <gnarf> but I keep starting on it, then running into something else
[11:54:34] <gnarf> I'm also trying to understand the limits.conf file to make sure I get it done right
[11:56:37] <scott_gonzalez> jasabella: Please use #jquery for support questions.
[12:07:30] <jasabella> sorry! :(
[12:08:14] <danheberden> is puppet changing that back?

[12:16:47] <gnarf> danheberden: i doubt it - the system itself is losing its "limits.conf" or whatever
[12:17:08] <gnarf> i need to figure out what the right way to set that limit is

[12:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: How are the plugins site docs coming along?
[12:32:51] <ajpiano> it isn't, yet :p
[12:33:30] <ajpiano> trying to get to a certain point with learn buld occupied last week, still working on that
[12:33:33] <ajpiano> today finishing up budget
[12:33:51] <ajpiano> gonna try to get to the docs later this week realistically
[12:33:52] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: how far along are you with the learn site build?
[12:34:56] <ajpiano> pretty solid, i have the wintersmith thing respecting the order.yaml but i'm still debugging issues and switching it all over to gfm
[12:35:06] <gnarf> ajpiano: so um
[12:35:09] <jzaefferer> gfm?
[12:35:11] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: too
[12:35:13] <gnarf> plugins
[12:35:13] <ajpiano> github flavoured markdown
[12:35:18] <gnarf> plugins head is on the block
[12:35:27] <gnarf> that machine is in the EOL list
[12:35:41] <gnarf> what do we need to make this new version happen by friday?
[12:36:12] <ajpiano> new version by friday would require docs for one thing, which i can prioritise over other stuff
[12:36:12] <gnarf> its that or i have to move the OLD plugins to a new server, which I would prefer not to do :)
[12:36:46] <ajpiano> but i don't know if the rest of the site can plausibly be ready by friday
[12:36:59] <gnarf> ajpiano: design still has some issues i think
[12:37:07] <ajpiano> yea
[12:37:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: The site is 100% functional as far as we know, so it's just docs and styling.
[12:37:31] <gnarf> rworth: ^^^
[12:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg noticed an issue with his local install, so I'd like to track that down.
[12:38:20] <gnarf> ajpiano / scott_gonzalez / rworth - do you think trying to launch plugins by friday is crazy/unattainable?
[12:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually in the process of setting up the WordPress sites on my new MBP right now.
[12:38:47] <scott_gonzalez> Seems possible.

[12:39:10] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I can't see anything that I changed that could have caused that weirdness.
[12:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: I doubt it's something you changed.
[12:39:23] <ajpiano> guess i'll work on docs for plugin site before learn build in that case :p
[12:39:55] <jzaefferer> gnarf: will the plugins archive be gone with the EOL deadline? if so, launching new site doesn't really make a difference, it'll be empty at first

[12:40:26] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: presumably yes it would, if gnarf doesn't install drupal
[12:40:31] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yes - it does mean this
[12:40:48] <gnarf> jzaefferer: it also means I don't have to figure out how to reproduce the environment running plugins currently
[12:40:53] <ajpiano> so if we are gonna try to keep archive.* up, then we still need to transition it by friday and ^^
[12:41:03] <jzaefferer> so the "only" thing we gain is something we can point at when people start complaining
[12:41:27] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: yeah. the only thing I can think of is maybe something was up with the old db when I had to do the grunt clean-all or whatever. dunno
[12:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: But clean-all would've deleted the old db.
[12:41:57] <kswedberg> oh. well, then that couldn't be it. :)
[12:42:05] <jzaefferer> nacin: did you ever figure out a way to avoid having to open the permalinks page to flush redirect rules, or whatever that did?
[12:42:21] <gnarf> jzaefferer: are you saying we need to put the old version online anyway?
[12:42:31] <gnarf> jzaefferer: which I'm kinda thinking is true anyway
[12:42:34] <jzaefferer> gnarf: people will complain if we don't, yeah
[12:42:34] <gnarf> which really really sucks
[12:42:46] <nacin> jzaefferer: on my plate for this week; I commented to the existing issue open
[12:42:50] <jzaefferer> having the new site available will reduce the complaints, not make them go away
[12:43:00] <ajpiano> so if we need to put the old version online anyway, then we don't actually need to rush to launch the new site by friday
[12:43:06] <jzaefferer> nacin: okay, thanks. Next time I'll look for the issue first
[12:43:09] <gnarf> ajpiano: this is true
[12:43:18] <ajpiano> all we need for friday is to keep archive.* running drupal
[12:43:42] <gnarf> ajpiano: but also it means that unless soemone steps up to get a machine running drupal that sounds like a pain
[12:44:01] <gnarf> could be easy
[12:44:02] <gnarf> i dunno
[12:44:03] <nacin> does the old site actually need to be functional, or can it be flat?
[12:44:06] <ajpiano> not following that comment really
[12:44:26] <gnarf> ajpiano: copying the old drupal over to a new server might be a clusterbomb of bugs
[12:44:26] <ajpiano> ohhh, you said "sounds like a pain" not "sounds like a plan"
[12:44:28] <ajpiano> lol
[12:44:45] <ajpiano> gnarf: +1
[12:44:51] <gnarf> i like where nacin's going with a flat html mirror
[12:44:56] <nacin> wget the whole site
[12:44:56] <gnarf> cuz that could be doable
[12:44:56] <nacin> done
[12:45:02] <rworth> +1
[12:45:03] <gnarf> ajpiano: ^^^ ?
[12:45:06] <ajpiano> +1
[12:45:15] <gnarf> jzaefferer: seem sane?
[12:45:17] <ajpiano> half the "drupal" features haven't worked in forever anyway
[12:45:40] <jzaefferer> http://i.imgur.com/LRfb9.jpg
[12:45:42] <jzaefferer> yeah
[12:45:47] <scott_gonzalez> How useful is search on the archive?
[12:46:07] <ajpiano> it doesn't appear to work
[12:46:23] <ajpiano> oh, it does if you actually go to the search page
[12:46:33] <scott_gonzalez> hah
[12:46:48] <nacin> jzaefferer: I was expecting that to be http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lltzgnHi5F1qzib3wo1_400.jpg
[12:46:48] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i'd go with "marginally useful"
[12:46:52] <ajpiano> *very* marginally
[12:46:52] <ajpiano> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/search/node/slideshow%20type%3Aproject_project
[12:48:47] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: That seems extremely useful.
[12:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> Seems to me like the site would be pretty useless without search.
[12:49:12] <scott_gonzalez> Way too many results and you can only narrow down by high level category.
[12:49:18] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: assuming you're willing to fight through two useless searches to actually get to that search result pages
[12:49:26] <ajpiano> and use an advanced search to whittle by issue type
[12:49:51] <scott_gonzalez> what?
[12:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> The top of the sidebar has a search form.
[12:50:16] <scott_gonzalez> Change the dropdown to "plugin" and search for what you want.
[12:50:18] <ajpiano> ah, yes, if you use the top of the sidebar search, it's a bit more useful
[12:50:19] <ajpiano> yes
[12:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> It should definitely default to searching for plugins and the search bar in the top should work, but those are separate issues.
[12:51:11] <scott_gonzalez> I can't see the archive being too useful as flat files.
[12:51:13] <ajpiano> it seems like we'd only know how broken the existing drupal site would be
[12:51:22] <ajpiano> if we try to get it up on another machine
[12:52:21] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: flat would be useful if functioning drupal isn't
[12:52:24] <ajpiano> doesn't *Work.
[12:52:32] <ajpiano> because of how many links already exist
[12:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, that's true.
[12:54:03] <gnarf> danheberden: do you remember if the old plugins was on my "don't have keys" list?
[13:12:36] <danheberden> i don't
[13:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> nacin gnarf danheberden: Do any of you have a few minutes to figure out why my Apache virtual hosts are fighting with each other?
[13:17:21] <gnarf> danheberden: yeah i need keys on plugins
[13:17:24] <gnarf> i don't currently have them
[13:17:33] <gnarf> plugins-db is a dead startup, but plugins has the old site
[13:27:54] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone else know a lot about Apache?
[13:32:52] <danheberden> gnarf added
[13:33:07] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: i normally just bumble around until stuff works
[13:33:33] <danheberden> so you have serveraliases that are repeated?
[13:34:23] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/9f3189898bdd2fad32ec
[13:34:33] <scott_gonzalez> Whichever is listed first always wins.
[13:34:45] <scott_gonzalez> Even though they have completely different aliases.
[13:36:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: im pretty sure that second can also be a DocumentRoot
[13:36:38] <gnarf> i've never used "VirtualDocumentRoot" before
[13:36:47] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Notice the %1
[13:36:50] <gnarf> or is that like an auto thing
[13:36:51] <gnarf> thats nice
[13:36:52] <gnarf> if it works
[13:36:53] <gnarf> :)
[13:37:18] <gnarf> yeah, i'm not sure
[13:37:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I can confirm that the VirtualDocumentRoot is not the problem.
[13:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> I changed it to DocumentRoot and hard-coded jquery-ui and it still resolves jquery-ui.code.dev to the first vhost.
[13:38:25] <gnarf> hrm
[13:38:47] <gnarf> thats like the exact minimalist block i use for my vhosts on apache too
[13:44:19] <ajpiano> after you get this resolved if someone could help me to set up the service to fake the post receieve hook on my local machine, that would be great
[13:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: https://gist.github.com/2932451
[13:45:47] <scott_gonzalez> Run that while you've got the plugins site server script running.
[13:46:41] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to run `node scripts/manager.js` to get the server running.
[13:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> Then just run that gist in another terminal.
[13:46:57] <ajpiano> where is manager.js
[13:47:09] <ajpiano> in the plguins site repo
[13:47:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah in /scripts/manager.js in the plugins.jquery.com repo.
[13:47:55] <scott_gonzalez> You should probably run `grunt clean-all setup` first if you haven't done that in a while.
[13:48:29] <ajpiano> i don't think i've ever done that
[13:48:29] <ajpiano> :p
[13:49:12] <ajpiano> is there an expectation that plugins.jquery.com repo is running from inside of the webroot of your local wp install ?
[13:49:20] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[13:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> It will actually not even be on the same server in production :-)
[13:49:37] <ajpiano> right, i didn't think so
[13:49:58] <ajpiano> running grunt in plugins.jquery.com repo leads to errors
[13:50:05] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/1V2v1Y1s3y1Y3w0x3Q45
[13:50:06] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[13:50:14] <ajpiano> sems like some pathing thing
[13:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> You don't have a config file.
[13:50:58] <agcolom> hi everyone! quick question regarding the api docs. I would like to follow your strategy for displaying demos in the docs... (i'm doing the jquerymobile one)... will you have inline demos in the api docs? and if you do, where will the files be stored? what URL will it be? (I am assuming displaying the inline demos in iframes). Or maybe I got this completely wrong ;-)
[13:51:25] <scott_gonzalez> cp config-sample.json config.json then edit
[13:51:29] <ajpiano> ah
[13:52:00] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ^^
[13:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ^^
[13:52:41] <rworth> scott_gonzalez which?
[13:52:49] <gnarf> rworth: agcolom's line :)
[13:52:54] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[13:53:44] <rworth> kswedberg have you worked on making demos work on api. yet?
[13:54:08] <gnarf> or kborchers maybe too? weren't you working a bit on api.jqueryui.com ?
[13:54:13] <agcolom> rworth: Hi! no big deal if that's not decided yet... I can carry on for the moment and add these later... was just wondering...
[13:54:26] <kswedberg> rworth: no. I suppose I oughta do that. was the plan to do it the same way we're doing it on the live site now?
[13:54:33] <kswedberg> or some other (better) way?
[13:54:46] <gnarf> agcolom: perhaps you can set a standard for us? :)
[13:54:54] <rworth> kswedberg how's it being done now?
[13:55:47] <agcolom> well I got one done: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/checkbox/ (to have a screenshot or the SF conf)
[13:55:59] <agcolom> but the file is on my work account ;-)
[13:56:02] <kswedberg> rworth: URL:http://static.jquery.com/api/demo.js
[13:56:29] <rworth> oh. In that case we should place static files in /resources/ and link to them
[13:56:39] <kswedberg> hahaha. yeah.
[13:56:42] <rworth> agcolom take a look at qunitjs.com for an example
[13:56:47] <rworth> the repo, that is
[13:57:15] <agcolom> nice
[13:58:24] <agcolom> I think it'd be nice to store all the static files in a folder or have them in a folder per widget, as there may be many examples for each widget...
[13:59:34] <kswedberg> rworth: do you mean api.qunitjs.com? or am I just missing the examples in qunitjs.com?
[14:00:10] <rworth> https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/blob/master/page/index.html#L33
[14:00:22] <rworth> er https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/blob/master/page/index.html#L48
[14:00:47] <rworth> though you can see how we avoid duplication by L33
[14:01:21] <kswedberg> ohhh!
[14:02:18] <agcolom> so in entries, I can just add a resources folder and do the same?
[14:03:02] <kswedberg> agcolom: resources should be top-level folder. right, rworth?
[14:03:19] <rworth> yeah
[14:03:26] <rworth> top-level
[14:03:39] <rworth> and it should always be linked to with href="/resources/..."
[14:03:50] <agcolom> ok so same level as entries?
[14:03:56] <rworth> but you can organize however you want within /resources/
[14:04:01] <rworth> agcolom right
[14:04:17] <kswedberg> rworth: 2 things: I just put this in the xml files on api.jquery.com, and the build script will handle it all? and we can have subdirs of resources, right?
[14:04:33] <kswedberg> oh, you answered question #2.
[14:04:46] <agcolom> great. Would you recommend one folder per widget in resources? (I may have up to 8 demos per widget...)
[14:05:07] <rworth> agcolom that sounds good
[14:05:08] <agcolom> I think 1 folder per widget would keep things cleaner...
[14:05:25] <agcolom> great! Thanks :-) have a great evening everyone :-)
[14:05:34] <rworth> kswedberg the build script will automatically copy of the folder tree in /resources/
[14:05:36] <kswedberg> thanks for doing that, agcolom!
[14:05:37] <agcolom> (or afternoon??)
[14:05:49] <rworth> yeah, thanks agcolom
[14:06:02] <kswedberg> rworth: and the @partial(…) thing?
[14:06:35] <kswedberg> is that an xsl thingie?
[14:06:36] <agcolom> no problem :-) I'm enjoying it ;-) I'm a bit slow but I am discovering so tiny errors in the docs that way, it is really useful!
[14:06:51] <rworth> kswedberg no, that's a grunt-jquery-content thing
[14:07:03] <rworth> ummmm, we may want to stick with xinclude since we're in xml land
[14:07:05] <kswedberg> ok. well, at least it's a something.
[14:07:08] <rworth> do it like notes
[14:07:15] <kswedberg> ok. will do.
[14:07:18] <rworth> see if that works anyway
[14:07:21] <rworth> should/might
[14:10:41] <kswedberg> rworth: I noticed api.jquery.com has a "pages" directory, but jquery.com and jquery.org have a "page" directory (and qunit.js has "out"). shouldn't they be consistent? which should it be?
[14:11:13] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: sorry, got sidetracked switching node versions
[14:11:38] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: do i just do something along the lines of your temp-jquery-foo plugin and commit and push?
[14:12:11] <rworth> kswedberg out is leftover from when qunit was docpad. "pages" is consistent with "entries" in that it's plural. But "page" is consitent with singular naming of post types in /dist/wordpress, like page/ and entry/ and plugin/ etc.
[14:12:59] <rworth> so we probably should be consistent, most repos are using grunt-jquery-content. For the time being we should be consistent with what it uses/expects
[14:13:12] <rworth> even for the sites which don't (yet/ever) use it
[14:19:44] <kswedberg> rworth: looks like grunt-jquery-content doesn't care. it's just passed as an arg in the site's grunt.js
[14:19:44] <kswedberg> "build-pages": {
[14:19:44] <kswedberg> 		all: grunt.file.expandFiles( "pages/*" )
[14:19:44] <kswedberg> 	}
[14:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: If you want to actually play around with what happens as plugins are added, then yeah.
[14:22:02] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise, you can just use the gist as is and it'll add the temp-jquery-foo plugin.
[14:22:11] <ajpiano> oh, sweet
[14:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> The script doesn't care what actually changed, it clones the repo and looks at the tags.
[14:23:01] <ajpiano> aha
[14:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> So all the script is doing is providing the minimum info that the script cares about to know that it needs to look for an update.
[14:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf danheberden: The problem with my vhosts was that I had a port listed in the NameVirtualHost config, but not in the individual VirtualHost entries.
[14:24:20] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently if you specify a port for NameVirtualHost, then you MUST specify a port for the individual vhosts for it to work properly.
[14:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> Or you can just not specify a port for NameVirtualHost and then the vhosts will work exactly as you expect.
[14:26:48] <rworth> kswedberg even better. Ok, I'm fine with /pages/ in the root as it's consistent with /entries/ and /resources/
[14:27:10] <rworth> and we should fix whatever is not consistent with that
[14:27:35] <kswedberg> ok. will do.
[14:28:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: good to know
[14:28:25] <kswedberg> (every time I write "will do," I should write down what exactly I agreed to do. I forget half of it)
[14:31:25] <gnarf> kswedberg: I've been making issues for myself like crazy
[14:31:26] <gnarf> :)
[14:31:34] <gnarf> otherwise I'm gonna forget about something
[14:31:36] <kswedberg> good idea.
[14:32:02] <gnarf> also
[14:32:11] <gnarf> somewhat in the hopes that someone stops by and is like "oh - i can help here"
[14:32:11] <gnarf> :)
[14:32:14] <kswedberg> except I hate GitHub's capricious notification system. I never know when I'm going to get notifications and when not
[14:32:39] <gnarf> kswedberg: if you made the issue - you get notified, if you reply to the issue you get notified, and i think if you watch the repo
[14:32:52] <kswedberg> hmm. ok.
[14:55:52] <kswedberg> rworth: I might call you tonight, if you're available. there's no way I'm going to figure out the example/demo include stuff in api.jquery.com on my own.
[14:56:14] <kswedberg> …not without wasting a lot of time, at least.
[14:56:48] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: he url it would be at after a successful import?
[14:56:53] <ajpiano> what's the*
[15:36:22] <ajpiano> hm, getting the missing themes message.
[15:39:45] <ajpiano> seemed to be working ok recently, i wonder what changed
[15:52:07] <ajpiano> just reinstalled everything, that worked :)
