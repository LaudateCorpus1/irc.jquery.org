[11:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Where did you find that SDK link?
[11:59:47] <kborchers> random google search having to do with jQuery, don't remember exactly but i was like huh?!
[12:01:10] <gnarf> hey out of curiosity, are any other ui peoples thinking about doing talks at the next jqcon?
[12:01:28] <gnarf> I was thinking about trying to put something together on UI Widget authoring
[12:01:32] <kborchers> gnarf: \o
[12:01:32] <gnarf> in 1.9
[12:01:50] <kborchers> mine may have more to do with mobile though
[12:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm considering sitting out this time :-P
[12:02:09] <gnarf> well in that case
[12:02:18] <gnarf> is there a topic you think the team should have someone stand up and cover? :)
[12:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> The awesomeness of 1.9.
[12:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps what's in 1.9, what's coming in 2.0. New widget features, new theming, general direction.
[12:18:40] <jzaefferer> I'm considering my Pitfalls and Opportunities of Single Page Applications talk.
[12:19:03] <jzaefferer> A "let's build JS applications with jQuery UI" talk would be nice
[12:19:23] <jzaefferer> With 1.9 the widget factory can do what Backbone.View has, and more
[12:20:10] <jzaefferer> In any case, I'm interested in giving feedback on any talk proposals and drafts
[12:20:33] <jzaefferer> The best presentations happen when more then one person is involved in their creation
[12:21:36] <jzaefferer> gnarf kborchers scott_gonzalez ↑
[12:22:54] <gnarf> i could be down on some teamthink talks
[12:23:20] <gnarf> I want to present something again, I had a great time doing it last time
[12:23:36] <gnarf> save for like crunching to finish writing my slides during the talk before mine... ;)
[12:23:59] <jzaefferer> you got good ratings, too: http://speakerrate.com/talks/8467-special-fx-a-review-of-jquery-animation-one-requestanimationframe-at-a-time :-)
[12:24:44] <jzaefferer> I did the Pitfalls talk at a local JS user group before the big one in Oxford, that helped with the timing
[12:25:09] <gnarf> ajpiano metioned that this time around we only have a single track
[12:27:39] <jzaefferer> You should demo accordion inside button inside timepicker insider datepicker /o\
[12:27:57] <jzaefferer> All positioned relative to a scrollable div inside an iframe inside a dialog
[12:28:04] <jzaefferer> RIGHT?
[12:36:36] * scott_gonzalez has flashback to draggable inside accordion inside accordion inside tabs inside draggable, going into nested droppables with a dialog on drop
[12:37:36] <jzaefferer> gnarf kborchers: I just submitted my pitfalls talk, though if it gets accepted, I'd like to get some feedback to improve that
[12:38:00] <jzaefferer> Let me know when you've got a proposal I could look at
[12:51:48] <kborchers> sorry guys i was afk
[12:52:00] <kborchers> jzaefferer: definitely! i would appreciate feedback
[12:52:16] <kborchers> still not sure where i'm going with it yet
[12:53:29] <kborchers> gnarf: ajpiano single track huh? so less talks or shorter slots?
[12:54:36] <ajpiano> just fewer talks
[12:54:39] <ajpiano> essentch
[12:54:54] <kborchers> ok
