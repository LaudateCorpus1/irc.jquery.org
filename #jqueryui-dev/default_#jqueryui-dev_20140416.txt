[01:21:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[01:21:27] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[01:21:27] <_|Nix|_> Is there ever a reason why HTML and BODY are larger than the page they contain?
[01:21:36] <_|Nix|_> ... if all they contain is a page?
[01:23:11] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7322#issuecomment-40533236
[01:23:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you use non-fixed toolbars outside page, we move them into the page, right?
[01:23:36] <_|Nix|_> I don't remember, but this is a much simpler scenario.
[01:23:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then I can't think of any reason
[01:23:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... although I don't think so.
[01:24:13] <uGoMobi> looking at the ticket now
[01:24:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The bottom line is that, on WP8 and iOS 6, if you resize the page using resetActivePageHeight, sometimes the HTML and BODY element end up larger than the page.
[01:24:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It doesn't happen on iOS7 or Android.
[01:24:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: WP8 is a disaster.
[01:26:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... here's an idea ... remove the min-height CSS before re-calculating it.
[01:26:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wonder if that'll fix it - I doubt it, but I'll give it a shot.

[01:30:32] <uGoMobi> found a wp8 phone
[01:30:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: where is the popup on that test page?
[01:31:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's no popup. The button is just labelled that way.
[01:31:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The bug is not about popups.
[01:31:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It happens with a simple page that has two inputs.
[01:32:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I noticed it while fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6961, which is why the button is labelled like that :)
[01:32:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[01:32:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I looked at the steps to reproduce that you wrote and saw "VKB pops up"
[01:33:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: VKB is the virtual keyboard.
[01:34:01] <uGoMobi> ahh
[01:34:03] <uGoMobi> :)
[01:34:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in Spain the day starts bit later ;-)
[01:34:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Riiiight :)
[01:36:35] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15nick-ma opened issue #7324: npm install grunt-qunit-istanbul failed, grunt can't work 02http://git.io/A6n8ng
[01:38:30] <_|Nix|_> Thing is, on iOS 6 it only happens the first time. The second time around, the height is correct, but only because the page has resized such that its height equals whatever is left over after the location bar is fully shown.
[01:39:33] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #7324: npm install grunt-qunit-istanbul failed, grunt can't work 02http://git.io/A6n8ng
[02:03:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: On iOS 6 you can fix the height issues if you do this: 1. Calculate the height you want the page to have, 2. Remove the min-height attribute, 3. Measure the height the page has without this attribute set. 4. If the measured value is less than the value you've calculated, then set min-height to the value you've calculated.
[02:04:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IOW, don't /always/ set min-height on the page. Only set min-height if the page doesn't have the height that you want it to have.
[02:04:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Unfortunately, that still doesn't help WP8 :(
[02:04:56] <_|Nix|_> 
[02:04:57] <_|Nix|_> http://jsbin.com/novifoba/8/
[02:06:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we do set a min-height in the CSS https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.core.css#L60
[02:07:04] <uGoMobi> resetActivePageHeight overrides that
[02:07:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: does it work on WP8 if you remove that?
[02:07:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, unfortunately.
[02:07:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It fixes iOS 6 though.
[02:08:01] <uGoMobi> I see
[02:08:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've updated http://jsbin.com/novifoba/8/ with some debugging output.
[02:08:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: On desktop, you need to set min-height. on iOS 6, it stretches the div for you, for some reason.
[02:08:32] <_|Nix|_> The page div.
[02:08:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So you don't need to set the min-height.
[02:19:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have to go now, but I think if we set min-height less agressively, then we might be better off. I'll test some more in the evening. I'm babysitting in the meantime, so I might pop in briefly here and there, but that's about it.
[02:20:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[02:20:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see you later

[07:21:33] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: Ping!
[07:21:56] <tj_vantoll> Hey, what's up?
[07:22:17] <arschmitz> what was the exact issue you were having with touch action on android?
[07:23:35] <tj_vantoll> Chrome 35 for Android supports touch-action, but jQuery UI's interactionsâ€”which add touch-action: noneâ€”don't work in it.
[07:23:48] <arschmitz> ok 
[07:24:03] <tj_vantoll> http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/fwk8R/show/ works on WP8 and Windows 8 touch devices, but not Chrome 35 for Android.
[07:24:06] <arschmitz> because i was just testing touch-action alone and it seems to be working
[07:24:15] <arschmitz> i havent tried with interactions yet
[07:24:16] <tj_vantoll> Yep, I tested that out too.
[07:24:25] <tj_vantoll> Vanilla touch-action seems to work great.
[07:25:52] <arschmitz> ok crazy
[07:26:10] <arschmitz> something in chrome 35 beta fixed mobiles swipe events
[07:26:16] <arschmitz> without even using touch action 
[07:26:33] <arschmitz> this is super weird since they essentially broke this on purpose
[07:27:56] <tj_vantoll> huh
[07:28:20] <arschmitz> in chrome if you dont prevent default on touch start or the first touch move you stop getting touch events
[07:28:33] <arschmitz> but if you prevent default you cant scroll
[07:29:10] <arschmitz> so this broke mobiles swipe event because we listen to touchmove events but dont want to effect scrolling
[07:30:12] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15scottgonzalez 04deleted 06pr/982 at 14e4efa01: 02http://git.io/BVsW0w
[07:30:29] <arschmitz> they did this because of performance issues with scrolling and touchmove
[07:31:12] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15scottgonzalez 04deleted 06fix-event-keycode at 140c85944: 02http://git.io/pfLNtQ
[07:31:46] <arschmitz> so scott_gonzalez and i had been talking to one of the guys from chrome about this and going to open an issue on it but he said there was a bunch of new stuff in 35  that might help a work around ( like touch-action )
[07:32:03] <arschmitz> so i was waiting to see what i could come up with in 35 beta 
[07:32:17] <arschmitz> but now i just tried it no changes at all and it works perfect every time now
[07:32:34] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: so clearly more then just the addition of touch action has changed
[07:33:37] <arschmitz> HAPPY DAY!!!
[07:33:41] <tj_vantoll> lol

[07:34:01] <arschmitz> now i just need to figure out what has changed!

[07:35:32] <tj_vantoll> Yeah the touch-action one is strange. I need to try logging events to see what's up.
[07:35:51] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: yeah i noticed one crazy thing
[07:36:08] <arschmitz> the first time i loaded a long test page with just plain touch-action:none;
[07:36:12] <arschmitz> i could still scroll
[07:36:25] <arschmitz> but then it continued to get worse the longer i scrolled
[07:36:40] <arschmitz> until i just stopped being able to scroll
[07:37:06] <arschmitz> and when i reload the page it works as it should and is never scrollable
[07:37:11] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: see anything like that?
[08:03:06] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: Sorry, was afk. No I haven't seen that.
[08:12:32] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: oh i know why interactions dont work! duh!
[08:13:21] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: wp8 works because it still dispatches mouse events. chrome does not it just added touch-action for pointer events big difference
[08:13:44] <arschmitz> not for pointer events for touch events i mean
[08:16:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pong
[08:16:43] <tj_vantoll> Ah, makes sense.
[08:17:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: swipe is fixed woo hoo roll out the banners ha ha
[08:18:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: chrome 35 beta works 100%
[08:18:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's awesome!
[08:19:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just wish i could tell you why!
[08:20:11] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:20:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im really confused actually what i see in 35 seems directly against why i was told
[08:21:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am looking for the changelog
[08:24:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://blog.chromium.org/2014/04/chrome-35-beta-more-developer-control.html
[08:24:30] <arschmitz> i see nothing about this change
[08:25:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, was looking here now http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?revision=239611&view=revision
[08:47:50] <jquicommit> [13download.jqueryui.com] 15jzaefferer opened pull request #203: jQuery UI Themes Packer: Remove basedir from manifest paths, with optional slash (06master...06themes-packer-manifest) 02http://git.io/z9iZrg
[09:04:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i figured it out
[09:05:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: wow this is like the perfect change for us and one i was going to suggest as a possible solution!
[09:06:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that sounds great
[09:06:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: browsers have a slop area
[09:07:41] <arschmitz> that is an area around your inital touch that when moved within will not trigger scrolling
[09:07:48] <arschmitz> to allow for taps and clicks etc
[09:07:57] <uGoMobi> right, some sort of treshold
[09:08:04] <arschmitz> and now as touchmove is dispatched in the slop area
[09:08:14] <arschmitz> and only killed once scrolling actually starts
[09:08:35] <arschmitz> they have also optimized a bit so that if scrolling is not possible it will always dispatch the touch move events
[09:09:23] <arschmitz> so now the problem of triggering swipe on scroll is impossible 
[09:09:53] <arschmitz> but now swipe has device defined thresholds too

[10:06:55] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, does UI have any widget that does not require a theme?
[10:07:18] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the interactions, to some degree
[10:07:51] <jzaefferer> actually tj_vantoll added draggable and scrollable css files recently, but I doubt that those files need the actual theme
[10:08:22] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll?
[10:09:32] <tj_vantoll> They do not.
[10:09:59] <tj_vantoll> They exist only to add touch-action: none.
[10:10:09] <tj_vantoll> I'm heading out for a bit.
[10:13:56] <rxaviers> thanks
[10:14:40] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, so yeap, I think it makes sense to have theme and base the way you said
[12:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> There's a new report for open UI tickets with duplicates: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/41
[13:00:01] <scott_gonzalez> This report only works for duplicates since some date (not sure when).
[13:00:32] <scott_gonzalez> Back in the day, Trac didn't add comments on the duplicate ticket, so those don't show up.
[13:42:34] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: It might be handy to have a Trac report for closed duplicates as wellâ€”sometimes it takes a few minutes to track down the numbers.
[13:58:47] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Sure. Would you want it to be just closed or all?
[13:59:16] <scott_gonzalez> I could do all grouped by component.
[13:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> That'd probably be the easiest to look through.
[14:02:10] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I like both.
[14:02:20] <tj_vantoll> And grouped by component would be great.
[14:02:43] <tj_vantoll> So the next time a <base> issue comes in we know how to grab the number quickly :P
[14:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/42
[14:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably limit that one.
[14:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe duplicates > 1
[14:09:47] <scott_gonzalez> done
[14:10:58] <tj_vantoll> Bookmarked :)
[14:11:28] <tj_vantoll> The dialog draggable issue is the most popular it seems, followed by CSS transforms, and then <base>.

[15:36:49] <gseguin> arschmitz: is there an issue on jqm regarding swipe events on the latest Chrome?
[15:37:10] <arschmitz> yeah i was just about to update it
[15:37:20] <gseguin> what's the number ?
[15:37:25] <arschmitz> as being fixed in 35
[15:37:50] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5534
[15:38:00] <gseguin> thanks
[15:38:06] <arschmitz> and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6805
[15:38:13] <arschmitz> which is a dup im about to close
[15:38:26] <gseguin> Probably the root cause for https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/issues/145 
[15:38:28] <gseguin> right?
[15:39:11] <arschmitz> probably if they are preventing default it would kill scrolling
[15:39:20] <gseguin> ok
[15:39:27] <gseguin> will look and send pointers
[15:39:30] <gseguin> thank you arschmitz 
[15:39:33] <arschmitz> gseguin: also
[15:39:39] <gseguin> yes ?
[15:39:46] <arschmitz> if they are using touch action or something similar
[15:40:19] <arschmitz> but their issue wont be fixed by chrome 35 like ours is
[15:41:16] <gseguin> they're doing preventDefault
[15:41:37] <arschmitz> gseguin: infact i would say what they are doing now preventing scrolling in that way would be what they are going for if you want to swipe to change something you generally dont want to scroll also
[15:43:07] <gseguin> arschmitz: is there an issue filed against chrome ?
[15:43:25] <arschmitz> no because this is what is supposed to happen 
[15:43:30] <arschmitz> its not a bug
[15:43:49] <gseguin> ok
[15:43:57] <arschmitz> if you preventdefault on touchstart or touchmove it should prevent scrolling
[15:44:11] <gseguin> ok
[15:44:30] <gseguin> I'll put a pointer to our issue in there
[15:45:40] <gseguin> thanks!
[15:46:30] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok im happy to explain it to anyone for clarification
[15:47:03] <gseguin> arschmitz: If Ken asks, I'll pull you in the conversation
[15:47:16] <gseguin> Thank you!
[15:47:19] <arschmitz> gseguin: also our swipe event works great in chrome 35 if they need pointers on swipe that works with scrolling
[15:47:29] <arschmitz> but it wont help 34
[15:48:13] <gseguin> I know there are a couple patterns in his code that could use vmouse
[15:48:56] <arschmitz> yeah and it would be easy to pull anything jqm out of swipe to leave a totally generic implementation
[21:29:39] <Rhomber> hey, so I just started using jquery mobile today.. and the experience was good until I tried to implement the swipe to open the panel.. works fine in desktop chrome.. but on my android phone it works like 1 out of 9 times.. it's really frustrating
[21:30:36] <Rhomber> any ideas?.. all the demos on the site involving swipe do the same thing.. using jquery mobile 1.4.2.. on a motorolla razr XT885 (android 4.0.4 ICS)
[23:16:27] <Rhomber> I fixed the earlier issue by adjusting the threshold
[23:17:07] <Rhomber> but now when it opens the side panel it seems to create a glitch over the main page?.. i.e. if the panel's background is white.. then the main page flashes white.. or if the panel's background is black.. then the main page flashes black?
[23:17:21] <Rhomber> this only happens when swiping to open.. and not when using the button
[23:17:40] <Rhomber> and also only when using the panel as "push" not "overlay"
[23:29:30] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Can you please file an issue at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/?
