[05:07:29] <rxaviers> guys is BrowserStack working for you?
[05:08:15] <rxaviers> It ofter tells me connection failed, that I'd be behind a firewall.  Sometimes, it simply works
[05:08:19] <rxaviers> often*
[05:08:41] <rxaviers> trying to open http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ with windowsXP/7 IE8, IE9
[05:09:13] <rxaviers> Im wondering if the problem is with me or global.
[05:12:37] <rxaviers> Hmm, one thing for sure is weird today with my internet.. local brazilian sites are turbo fast. But, outer are really slow.
[07:20:42] <rxaviers> Anyone with Safari 6.0.3 able to do a dry-run?

[07:20:57] <b-ot> rxaviers: Issue #134 by rlvandaveer (1d 36m ago): ThemeRoller editing does not work in Safari 6.0.3
[07:21:14] <rxaviers> The above doesn't fail on browserStack Safari 6.0.
[07:58:31] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I've got Safari 6.0.2, should be good enough.
[07:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'll test now.
[07:58:40] <rxaviers> cool thks
[08:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> worksforme
[08:01:38] <rxaviers> might be a local issue to the user then
[08:01:42] <rxaviers> thanks
[08:01:52] <rxaviers> should I tell this to him?
[08:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> I also tested with Private Browsing and Reset Safari
[08:02:45] <rxaviers> ok thks
[08:02:57] <rxaviers> do you think it can be a 6.0.3 thing?
[08:03:53] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe. I can install the update and try again.
[08:04:00] <scott_gonzalez> It'll require restarting my laptop :-(
[08:04:06] <rxaviers> :
[08:04:10] <rxaviers> :'(
[08:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> So give me a few minutes...
[08:04:16] <rxaviers> I think it's not urgent
[08:04:26] <rxaviers> dont wanna bother you this way
[08:04:28] <rxaviers> sry
[08:04:29] <rxaviers> :)
[08:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> The life of a web developer...

[08:16:35] <b-ot> kswedberg: Pull request #114 by tjvantoll (2d 11h ago): Documenting 1.11's instance method for all widgets.
[08:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks kswedberg
[08:17:31] <kswedberg> sure thing. Sorry I can't be more definitive. 
[08:17:39] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[08:18:04] <jzaefferer> What's with all those surveys about GitHub?
[08:18:21] <jzaefferer> "In return for your efforts, one random member from one of the projects you are working on will receive a $100 gift certificate to the Apple Store or PC equivalent (in your area)." wow, great reward!
[08:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't seen any surveys.
[08:19:18] <jzaefferer> Good for you
[08:19:21] <jzaefferer> You're not missing out

[11:07:06] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ping
[11:07:18] <rxaviers> quicker to discuss here :)
[11:07:48] <rxaviers> when you say supported by sites, is that jquery-wp-content?
[11:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think jzaefferer would've created that issue if you didn't say "We don't support IE9."
