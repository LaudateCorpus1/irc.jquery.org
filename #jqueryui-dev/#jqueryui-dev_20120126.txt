[02:41:15] <sYFFAN> is the menu widget in a usable state? also, when is the 1.9 release planned?
[06:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yt?
[06:32:58] <kborchers> i miss gnarfsy :(
[07:05:23] <jzaefferer> kborchers scott_gonzalez: looking for crossbrowser stylesheet manipulation, needs to work in IE8+. Basically I need to create a style element with a few rules on the fly, so that those apply when no inline styles are present. Any pointers?
[07:05:36] <jzaefferer> Just creating a style-element works in Chrome, but throws up in IE...
[07:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> $( "<style>asfadsf</style>" ).appendTo( "body" ) has always worked for me.
[07:06:48] <kborchers> Oh IE, how I love thee. Let me count the ways ... 0!
[07:08:46] <kborchers> yeah, that is what i would suggest as well. i think you could maybe use something like yepnope too but that may be overkill
[07:10:13] <jzaefferer> I'll try that
[07:10:30] <jzaefferer> glad to know I'm not the only one having to do that...
[07:13:18] <jzaefferer> thanks scott_gonzalez, that works
[07:16:08] <jzaefferer> all this crap I'm doing on this project, and with that fix, it all works in IE8 just as it does in Chrome

[18:57:03] <clarkbox> i am surprised the widget factory does not expose the selector... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4986402/accessing-selector-within-a-jquery-ui-widget
[18:57:24] <clarkbox> would it be worth my while to submit a patch to add this?
[19:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[19:04:51] <clarkbox> related to the patch i submitted for popup()
[19:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds really bad.
[19:05:03] <clarkbox> i have a widget that abstracts popup() and  menu()
[19:05:05] <clarkbox> haha
[19:05:16] <clarkbox> so that you can create popup/drop down menus
[19:05:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'd want to see the actual use case.
[19:05:40] <clarkbox> so... $('target').contextMenu({...})
[19:05:58] <scott_gonzalez> Why can't contextMenu deal with it?
[19:06:08] <clarkbox> well it would have to be an option
[19:06:22] <clarkbox> let me pastebin some code quick
[19:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[19:06:50] <kborchers> clarkbox: popup drop down menus? you mean like http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Selectmenu ??
[19:07:45] <clarkbox> yes
[19:07:52] <clarkbox> but needs to handle everything menu() can
[19:07:57] <clarkbox> such as nested menus
[19:08:04] <clarkbox> can this do that?
[19:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> No
[19:08:11] <kborchers> no
[19:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> Why do you need access to the selector for that?
[19:09:01] <clarkbox> http://pastebin.com/GpQyZh4R
[19:09:14] <clarkbox> so... thats a widget that just abstracts some boilerplate code
[19:09:21] <clarkbox> we have repeated
[19:09:28] <clarkbox> ...workj in progress so its a bit of a mess
[19:09:34] <clarkbox> see line 20
[19:09:40] <clarkbox> i need the selector there
[19:09:58] <clarkbox> otherwise, i need to add the trigger selector as an option
[19:10:10] <clarkbox> but thats ugly redundancy
[19:11:16] <clarkbox> (this assumes this patch goes through https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/582
[19:11:16] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by clarkbox (3d, 1h ago): Popup: modified trigger option to support multiple elements.
[19:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe popup doesn't have a good API
[19:13:17] <clarkbox> i think its fine
[19:13:32] <clarkbox> i cant think how changing popup's api would help me here
[19:14:13] <clarkbox> do you get what im trying to do with that widget i pastebin'ed
[19:14:17] <scott_gonzalez> Well, either the pastebin code doesn't do what you want, or you don't need access to the selector
[19:15:25] <clarkbox> pastebin code has been good thus far.... using it to create a popup menu() on a single trigger
[19:15:44] <clarkbox> but now i need the same menu on multiple triggers
[19:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe the API on popup should be reversed
[19:16:03] <clarkbox> and id like to keep using that widget. in my mind, jquery-ui should have a widget that does this
[19:16:14] <scott_gonzalez> You never need multiple menus on a single trigger.
[19:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> You might need multiple triggers on a single menu.
[19:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like the API is backward.
[19:18:25] <clarkbox> this is how you would use that pastebin code: $('.settingsBtn').contextMenu({ menu: $('.indexGridMenu') });
[19:18:41] <clarkbox> so in my case, i have multiple 'settingBtn's
[19:19:05] <clarkbox> and i want to hang that 'indexGrudMenu off each one
[19:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> It's the same menu element for all, right?
[19:19:31] <clarkbox> yes
[19:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> So why shouldn't popup work that same way?
[19:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> $( trigger ).popup({ menu: ... })
[19:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> Instead of $( menu ).popup({ trigger: ... })
[19:20:11] <clarkbox> oh... ok.
[19:20:28] <clarkbox> ya thinking back thats how i thought popup() would be used
[19:20:37] <clarkbox> but... you dont always have a trigger for popup
[19:20:48] <clarkbox> when you want to programmatically open it
[19:20:58] <scott_gonzalez> I think popup is gonna be tricky for the average person.
[19:21:15] <clarkbox> hence why i am abstracting it away in this widget im building
[19:21:24] <scott_gonzalez> But based on your actual use cases, it sounds like it's backward right now.
[19:21:43] <clarkbox> even if it was reversed, i would still have this issue
[19:21:59] <clarkbox> this.element.popup(...) is not sufficient
[19:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> It wouldn't be too bad.
[19:22:13] <scott_gonzalez> You'd just pass the element through
[19:22:14] <clarkbox> i need $(this.selector).popup
[19:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> this.element.popup({ menu: this.options.menu })
[19:22:57] <clarkbox> ahhh yes
[19:23:48] <clarkbox> so if the API were reversed... how would you handle programatic popups?
[19:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> $( trigger ).popup( "open" )
[19:24:58] <clarkbox> but you may not have a trigger
[19:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> Actually seems more correct than $( menu ).popup( "open" )
[19:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> You have to have a trigger
[19:25:18] <clarkbox> oh ok. i dont think thats the case now is it?
[19:25:35] <scott_gonzalez> I would think so.
[19:25:44] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise what would be the point of using popup?
[19:25:58] <scott_gonzalez> Popup without a trigger is just an element, isn't it?
[19:26:03] <clarkbox> pretty sure you can do ('.popup').popup()
[19:26:05] <scott_gonzalez> open -> .show()
[19:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> The trigger before this.element.prev() in that case.
[19:26:34] <scott_gonzalez> That much I know :-)
[19:26:40] <clarkbox> but thats an ugly assumtion
[19:26:51] <clarkbox> i think youre right tho. this API needs revising
[19:27:10] <clarkbox> and you then always need to explicitly specify the trigger
[19:27:17] <clarkbox> will remove a lot of confusion
[19:27:24] <clarkbox> and help with my use case best of all! ;)
[19:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, most plugins should never use this.selector
[19:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> It's pretty much a broken way of building a plugin.
[19:28:08] <clarkbox> yes, most. but still might be nice to pass along. at least worth further consideration i think
[19:28:09] <scott_gonzalez> $( DOMElement ).selector === ""
[19:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> Which means if you use it in contextMenu, your plugin will be broken for certain use cases.
[19:28:34] <clarkbox> i agree. but in this case, its the only way forward unless popup() api were to change
[19:29:08] <scott_gonzalez> There are a ton of ways to break a plugin that uses this.selector.
[19:29:24] <scott_gonzalez> $( "span" ).parents( "a" ).selector === "OMG WTF?"
[19:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[19:29:34] <clarkbox> ya, ok. forget about that idea. lets just revise popup() api! :)
[19:29:45] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good :-)
[19:30:05] <clarkbox> sounds like a big job
[19:30:11] <clarkbox> whos going to take that on?
[19:30:16] <clarkbox> * ducks
[19:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I'm gonna guess nobody since it's not really on the roadmap :-P
[19:31:00] <clarkbox> well, if you want to lobby for it, ill take it on
[19:31:12] <clarkbox> or am i just dreaming ?
[19:32:01] <scott_gonzalez> Well, like I've said, I don't really know much about popup.
[19:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> But from our conversations, it sounds like it should be chagned.
[19:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> If you're willing to work on it, you should run the idea by jzaefferer
[19:32:44] <clarkbox> ya i think i can get some company time to work on the problem
[19:32:58] <clarkbox> jzaefferer ^ let me know what you think
[19:36:26] <kborchers> hey scott_gonzalez i'll be in Raleigh 3/5 and 3/6, probably 3/4 too. I'll let you know what my schedule looks like those days once i know and we'll have to grab a beer or something
[19:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> Cool. 3/6 is actually my daughter's birthday :-P
[19:37:53] <scott_gonzalez> Her party is the weekend after though, so that works out well.
[19:38:25] <kborchers> cool, i'm probably flying home 3/6 anyway. if they bring me out 3/4 that might work best
