[10:25:24] <trentrichardson> Hey everyone.  I'm the author of jquery timepicker addon (https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Timepicker-Addon) and need advice on direction forward. I honestly don't have time to keep it up like it needs to be, I'd like to offer it to the jqueryui team if they were interested, otherwise I need to decide how to better the project with my extremely limited time schedule
[10:33:21] <trentrichardson> Other option is to build a small reliable team to help with the project. Any advice for either direction?
[10:39:43] <scott_gonzalez> trentrichardson: jQuery UI doesn't accept existing plugins.
[10:39:57] <scott_gonzalez> Especially with that many options, we'd have a massive amount of work to restructure it.
[10:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'd recommend filing an issue about build a team, then tweet it, post it on the jQuery forums, etc.
[10:40:59] <scott_gonzalez> You've got a pretty popular plugin, so you should be able to find some people.
[10:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> Though I will tell you that it can be difficult to find a team of reliable developers.
[10:51:31] <trentrichardson> scott_gonzalez: thanks for the feedback. I had a feeling that would be the case as I know it would be a lot of work to fully integrate, but thought I'd throw it out there.
[10:52:02] <trentrichardson> I will post that I'm looking for reliable team members and see what I can come up with.  Thanks!
