[08:48:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: does that actually work? :)
[08:48:57] <gnarf> nice...
[09:49:07] <kborchers> gnarf: finally had a chance to look at dave's draggable stuff
[09:50:05] <kborchers> most seems ok but had the same questions scott posted in comments about the reasoning for handling relative different than fixed/absolute and nested scrollable parents.
[09:50:34] <kborchers> also left a note here https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/commit/c8e13708eb90728978a119c6adeef3010ff332e7#commitcomment-656314
[09:50:35] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by DaveStein (1w, 1d ago): Draggable: Scrollbars being handled when scrollParent is document
[10:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: crazy, right? the shit we do to make browsers behave...
[10:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> yay, now up to three bugs for incorrect Firefox autocomplete behavior
[10:58:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yt?
[10:58:53] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: https://gist.github.com/1293284
[11:00:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sup
[11:01:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can we use _delay instead of the setTimeout / self in that function too? :)
[11:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> check out the gist
[11:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> the first change in autocomplete?
[11:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> probably
[11:02:24] <gnarf> yeah
[11:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> autocomplete doesn't even use _bind yet :-P
[11:03:10] <gnarf> my only question
[11:03:18] <gnarf> should it be "doc" and "win"
[11:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> instead of the full names?
[11:03:43] <gnarf> yeah
[11:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, we should probably use the full names
[11:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> we generally use doc and win for local vars, but we also say not to abbreviate variables
[11:04:42] <gnarf> right
[11:04:51] <gnarf> plus document and window are already prolly gzip
[11:04:53] <gnarf> keys
[11:05:01] <gnarf> they are super common in js
[11:05:21] <scott_gonzalez> core uses doc and win
[11:05:37] <gnarf> hrm
[11:05:42] <gnarf> want me to adapt sizer.js?
[11:05:48] <gnarf> to run in ui
[11:05:52] <gnarf> so we can compare?
[11:06:01] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[11:06:26] <gnarf> it'll add a node dependcy to our build
[11:06:31] <kborchers> sorry was afk
[11:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think that would be a problem anywhere, but if it's not in the default build then it wouldn't matter
[11:10:58] <gnarf> anyone familiar with ant?
[11:11:09] <gnarf> trying to figure out how to replicate JS_ENGINE ?= `which node nodejs`
[11:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer does all of the ant stuff
[11:34:25] <gnarf> does our build not minify each file separately?
[11:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> I think it does
[11:39:09] <gnarf> hrm
[11:39:12] <gnarf> when i run ant minify
[11:39:18] <gnarf> i only see the concactenated ones in dist/
[11:44:24] * scott_gonzalez runs a build
[11:45:52] <gnarf> results?
[11:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...no individual files
[11:47:28] <gnarf> should there be?
[11:48:10] <scott_gonzalez> they're in the downloads: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/41505725/Download%20Builder%20Rewrite
[11:48:35] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we don't get a development-bundle with this build though
[11:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> must be something the download builder does
[11:49:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: did we say ummm fb71ebad6a7022f3b17562df798f36defde057fd ?
[11:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[11:49:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems someone introduced a bug
[11:49:55] <gnarf> if we go back to that commit
[11:49:58] <gnarf> we get all the files
[11:49:59] <gnarf> im gonna fix it
[11:51:13] <scott_gonzalez> heh, probably from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/a6f80193259682d71510b9134388824c43f49d8f
[11:51:14] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by techtangents (4m, 4w ago): Builds: used ant parallel task to run the two closure compiler steps and the yui css compressor step in parallel. The http get requests for documentation are also run in parallel. Reduced build time by about 40%. Fixed #7404 - build.xml can run quicker.
[11:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> it runs faster because it does less :-P
[11:55:41] <gnarf> i dunno
[11:55:45] <gnarf> i don't see any change there
[11:57:07] <gnarf> yeah
[11:57:18] <gnarf> f78f20a07723f33d8234d912372ad4f8208ce5ce has it
[12:01:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: checking out on that commit it seems to work correctly
[12:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> weird, since that's the last commit to the ant build
[12:02:22] <gnarf> maybe
[12:02:50] <gnarf> yeah, confirmed
[12:02:51] <gnarf> with a clean
[12:03:25] <gnarf> and wtf
[12:03:30] <gnarf> it seems to be doing this
[12:03:38] <gnarf> on master now, i get all the files again
[12:04:08] <gnarf> aha
[12:04:46] <gnarf> minify should run after "copy" if you want all of them
[12:04:49] <gnarf> so ant copy minify
[12:04:52] <gnarf> gives you all of them
[12:07:12] <gnarf> hrm
[12:07:25] <gnarf> i can't help but wonder if uglify isn't faster than closure compiler
[12:07:26] <gnarf> :)
[12:12:47] <gnarf> man
[12:12:53] <gnarf> minifying jquery ui takes FOREVER
[12:17:25] <gnarf> heh
[12:17:26] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/f21a294332d5d21b4352
[12:19:17] <gnarf> should i add the css files to that list too?
[12:35:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think this is ready
[12:35:29] <gnarf> im gonna try replacing closure compiler with uglify on the js
[12:37:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: want me to push this ant size into master ?
[12:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> what does it use for the previous build?
[12:42:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the last time you ran ant size
[12:43:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/a6edb7fcac8a08d54d21
[12:43:50] <gnarf> that was the diff between the master i had
[12:43:53] <gnarf> and the master i just pulled
[12:43:54] <gnarf> for instance
[12:44:44] <gnarf> want me to push it?
[12:44:51] <gnarf> we can always work from here
[12:47:47] <gnarf> i think i got it backported onto 1-8-stable as well
[12:47:57] <gnarf> making a report for the diff in size between 1.9 and 1.8 :)
[12:48:17] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, push it
[12:48:34] <gnarf> now to play with uglify

[13:09:49] <gnarf> uglify btw takes 1 minutes

[13:10:05] <gnarf> im checking a size comparison now

[13:17:26] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do we want to implement a minified header like jQuery did?
[13:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> probably, but not really worth doing anything with the ant build
[13:22:03] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/3dbf5a92ae075993f684
[13:22:09] <gnarf> thats using uglify
[13:22:13] <gnarf> its smaller
[13:23:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I can do the minified header in ant no prob
[13:24:36] <scott_gonzalez> [exec]      419   (+291) jquery.ui.datepicker-bs.min.js.gz
[13:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> that's interesting
[13:24:53] <gnarf> hrm
[13:24:55] <gnarf> maybe its buggy
[13:25:00] <gnarf> i'll double check
[13:25:09] <gnarf> sizer hasn't ever be used against this many files ;)
[13:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:29:30] <gnarf> i think that might be like a natural buffer barrier there
[13:29:42] <gnarf> cuz running it again gave me some other strange results
[13:31:29] <gnarf> alright
[13:31:33] <gnarf> i think i got that bug fixed

[13:38:43] <gnarf> :)
[13:47:36] <kborchers> i've got the two FF's running
[13:48:21] <kborchers> i would fire up old ie's for you but i know they'll just crash and i can't keep an eye on them
[13:58:14] <scott_gonzalez> if we can figure out the async problem, then we can actually get some passing builds
[13:58:35] <scott_gonzalez> at that point it would be worth getting the clients connected
[14:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> Opera 11.1x keeps having trouble connecting
[14:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: is that your IE 6 that's connected?
[14:05:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no
[14:05:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: im on safari
[14:06:22] <gnarf> starting up ie7
[14:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> I just connected with IE 8
[14:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> wow, IE 8 just crashed
[14:15:20] <kborchers> heh, that's why i didn't bother ... though FF7 locked up for me once too
[14:17:46] <kborchers> i've got ie 8,9 running but looks like 7 is down again
[14:20:53] <scott_gonzalez> giving up and going downstairs
[14:32:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think i figured out the issue with the sizer
[14:38:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so like - do we add a dependency for node & unix to ant ?
[14:38:43] <gnarf> nevermind
[14:38:44] <fogggg> 	I have an issue with jquery ui.. I have a page with a .live binding to open a dialog, and in that dialog theres an option to open another dialog. When the first dialog is opened only everything works fine, but once the second dialog opens, all the .live events on the original page stop working. Any ideas why that might happen? None of the original pages html is modified
[14:38:44] <gnarf> damnit
[14:40:23] <gnarf> its actually an issue with my uglify ant shit
[14:40:35] <gnarf> fogggg: support in #jquery please
[14:54:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: something about running node in parallel messes with output buffering
[14:54:08] <gnarf> even the gzip isn't getting redirected right
[14:54:15] <gnarf> unless i pull it out of parallel
