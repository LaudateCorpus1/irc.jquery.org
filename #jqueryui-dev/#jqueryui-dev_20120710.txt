[05:39:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez whoops, sorry about the mess there. should have caught that
[05:39:17] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez did you see my comment about the regex?
[05:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I thought it could be reused since the code was the same. Stupid variables being all variable and shit :-P
[05:41:47] <kborchers> :)
[05:42:46] <kborchers> still a couple of TODOs to take care of which i should be able to get to tonight
[05:42:55] <scott_gonzalez> I remember a talk from Rich Hickey when he was talking about how variables are bad (is that all talks from all functional programmers?)
[05:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> And he was like "What do variables do when you're not looking? THEY VARY!"
[05:43:13] <kborchers> heh

[05:46:21] <kborchers> what the????? position failure?
[05:48:34] <kborchers> FF13 position tests pass locally for me :/
[05:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG it ran without subpixels.
[05:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> How is that possible?
[05:49:50] <kborchers> i have no idea … browsers suck
[05:50:08] <kborchers> i just ran it manually in FF13 on browserstack and all tests passes too
[05:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> meh
[05:50:22] <scott_gonzalez> It'll probably pass on the next run.
[05:50:27] <kborchers> yep
[05:50:33] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yt?
[05:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell gnarf the effects failures are from .data() not from .css()!
[05:51:23] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[05:51:50] <kborchers> i hate you bot-t … why wouldn't you tell scott my message last night jerk?
[05:52:51] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[05:53:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9917
[05:54:10] <scott_gonzalez> So this seems problematic. We can't differntiate between 0 and "" if we get back undefined.
[05:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to change it to set "". It's wrong, but less wrong than what's happening today :-P

[06:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: It passed this time :-P
[06:09:12] <kborchers> i blame bot-t
[06:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> I can't reproduce the one remaining failure in the release coverage test :-/
[06:14:21] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!

[06:14:21] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Effects: Work around jQuery 1.6.2 returning undefined for falsy values in .data().
[06:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I just rebased menu-review and force pushed so that only the remaining TODOs are in there.
[06:26:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez ok, cool. do you remember what jzaefferer said about why position would be a function?
[06:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> I don't. I actually just checked all the demos and visual tests and didn't see any uses of it.
[06:26:50] <scott_gonzalez> I seem to remember it being related to submenus.
[06:26:55] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I remember.
[06:26:58] <scott_gonzalez> The iPod style menu.
[06:27:04] <kborchers> oh right
[06:27:16] <scott_gonzalez> Because it needs to use the parent of the active.
[06:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like that's an edge case that can probably be handled in a different way.
[06:27:49] <kborchers> kill it for now?
[06:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[06:27:55] <kborchers> ok
[06:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> Where's the code for the ipod menu?
[06:28:54] <kborchers> i think it only existed in whoever's fork was working on it … James I believe
[06:29:19] <kborchers> and a lot has changes since he worked on it
[06:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:30:04] <kborchers> man i am mixing d and s up a lot today
[06:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> That ducks :-P

[08:18:12] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ping
[08:18:20] <kswedberg> hey
[08:18:50] <kswedberg> gotta run. will be back ~12:50
[08:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I was just wondering if you could come up with some better descriptions for all of the jQuery UI plugins.
[08:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: What do you think of adding gravatar support to the plugins site?
[08:32:50] <ajpiano> i think that would be a good idea
[08:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'll file an issue for it, should be easy to add.
[08:34:04] <ajpiano> yeah, i think the gh api gives you it back
[08:34:48] <scott_gonzalez> I was thinking we'd just calculate email hashes on the fly in WordPress.
[08:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> Since you can include email addresses for author and maintainers in the manifest file.
[08:35:47] <ajpiano> ahh
[08:35:59] <ajpiano> you can hit gravatar with just an e-amail
[08:36:00] <ajpiano> ?
[08:36:16] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: if you're already going to GH, then it might already be there for you to use, so take a look there first i guess
[08:36:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, you just need to generate the md5 of the email.
[08:36:24] <ajpiano> oh nice
[08:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> We don't use the GH API for anything, we just listen to the post-receive hook.
[08:36:52] <ajpiano> ok ok
[08:36:55] <ajpiano> gotcha

[10:37:16] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: can't remember if it was you or jzaefferer who asked me to take a look at the jQuery UI description in package.json. anyway, here are a couple ideas: https://gist.github.com/eead88f230f6c9b931d6
[10:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Thanks. We'll also need descriptions for the individual plugins.
[10:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> Right now they show up on http://jqueryui.com/download
[10:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> But we'll also need content for the plugins site.
[10:39:05] <kswedberg> ok. where should I make actual edits? want me to just gist something up for those, too?
[10:40:19] <scott_gonzalez> A gist is fine. You could also edit the json files here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/manifest/build
[10:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> Note that it's in the manifest branch, not master.
[10:40:56] <kswedberg> ah. ok. cool.
[10:41:15] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[11:02:17] <peol> scott_gonzalez, you're very welcome to patch socialhapy :) https://github.com/peol/socialhapy/blob/master/modules/github.js
[11:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> peol: Just what I need, more work ;-)
[11:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll put it on my list.
[11:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> How easy/hard is it to test socialhapy?
[11:05:31] <peol> scott_gonzalez, hehe, know the feeling. I'm on my 13th hour today :/
[11:06:00] <peol> scott_gonzalez, very easy. just fill in the blanks in example config, rename it config.js and do node socialhapy.js
[11:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[11:07:33] <peol> if you run into problems, just ping me here or on twitter (preferably, I don't normally have access to IRC at work)
[11:07:44] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Menu's API is massive :-/
[11:09:35] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez you're very welcome to patch menu https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[11:09:36] <kborchers> :P
[11:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> Should methods like isFirstItem and isLastItem really be public?
[11:10:00] <kborchers> hmmm
[11:10:03] <kborchers> probably not
[11:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> We need to find a way to mark methods as stable but not public.
[11:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> The naming is kind of bad.
[11:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> They need to be public and documented, but separate from the normal jQuery API.
[11:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> Up to now we've been dealing with it by just adding the underscore and not documenting at all.
[11:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> Which isn't that great.
[11:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> But we're at least consistent.
[11:11:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'll move those two methods to "private"
[11:11:33] <kborchers> ok
[11:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> There's no case where they're useful via .menu( "isFirstItem" ), right?
[11:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> If you're doing that check, you're probably working directly with the instance.
[11:13:20] <scott_gonzalez> And managing focus yourself.

[13:36:23] <peol> but i guess you rarely type these urls manually anyway, so… :)
[13:37:26] <scott_gonzalez> Rarely but if I do it's usually HEAD
[13:39:04] <scott_gonzalez> I would definitely not manually type a SHA + ^
[13:39:38] <scott_gonzalez> And if I did that in the location bar, I'd press y to get a proper SHA first
