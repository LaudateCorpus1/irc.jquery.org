[07:38:30] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[07:44:13] <jzaefferer> for a change, I'm here :-)
[07:45:29] <kborchers> hey jzaefferer!
[07:45:58] <jzaefferer> yo, sup?
[07:46:39] <kborchers> maybe you know. was there a reason that the types were removed from all but the create event for datepicker at some point? talking with someone in #jquery who is upgrading UI and they did all of their onSelect binding with bind and they break now.
[07:50:52] <jzaefferer> no idea
[07:51:45] <kborchers> ok, i'm trying to look back through the history to see when it was changed to see if i can figure out why
[07:52:03] <kborchers> did you see my note about http://jqbug.com/ui/p419 ?
[07:52:16] <kborchers> yesterday in here
[07:53:30] <kborchers> It looks like it fixes the fraction unit test in IE, chrome still works but it breaks the test in FF so we probably need a different solution or at least some sort of tweak to this one. i can comment in the PR if you want
[08:18:15] <jzaefferer> nope, didn't really catch up on anything here
[08:18:32] <jzaefferer> you should never hold back on commenting on PRs :-)
[08:19:01] <jzaefferer> that's the point of testing it, giving the author feedback
[08:19:42] <kborchers> ok, i'll do that now
[10:51:49] <gnarf-web> hey, are we going to have a fresh 1.9b before jqconf?
[10:51:57] <gnarf-web> I'd like to talk about some of the new effects api in my talk
[10:52:10] <gnarf-web> itd be nice if there was a place other than the git build for them to preview it
[16:52:01] <jzaefferer> gnarf: should do another milestone release soon
