[07:05:56] <gnarf> so, i was just starting to fall in love with browserstack
[07:06:01] <gnarf> then my trial ran out
[07:06:02] <gnarf> :(
[07:07:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: any chance you think they might donate us a "team" account as well as having the swarms running? :)
[07:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> I can ask
[07:10:19] <gnarf> otherwise i'll have to find the $20/mo for it i think
[07:10:23] <gnarf> way easier than carting VMs
[07:10:32] <gnarf> and their IE's actually have useful dev tools in them

[07:22:31] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (11h, 23m ago): Menu: Allow keyboard navigation of the Menu after it has been activated by mouse
[07:22:48] <kborchers> i know you were saying something about creating a focus element but can't remember where you were going with that
[07:22:57] <kborchers> wow, i was out of it
[07:23:01] <gnarf> kborchers: this.focus.focus() instead of this.element.focus()
[07:23:14] <gnarf> then you could set menu.focus = this.element from the autocomplete
[07:23:24] <gnarf> but then the problem was binding the key events to the "new" focus
[07:23:43] <rworth> gnarf: it looks right while focused, but after blur the optional part should hide if there are no characters in it
[07:24:02] <kborchers> hmmm

[07:59:41] <kborchers> gnarf: so, i was thinking about the flag again and realized i could make it much simpler and could remove that extra tab key binding. i feel much better about the flag now, what do you think? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/495
[07:59:42] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (12h, 50s ago): Menu: Allow keyboard navigation of the Menu after it has been activated by mouse
[08:01:11] <gnarf> looks pretty decent - but still feels a little dirty
[08:03:32] <kborchers> yeah, i know what you mean .... jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez thoguhts? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/495
[08:03:33] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (12h, 4m ago): Menu: Allow keyboard navigation of the Menu after it has been activated by mouse
[08:05:21] <scott_gonzalez> what is that solving?
[08:05:50] <kborchers> when you mouse over a menu and start going through the items, the menu wasn't actually focused
[08:06:02] <kborchers> this meant if you tried to pick up with keyboard interaction, nothing happened
[08:06:45] <kborchers> but needed the flag to prevent the menu taking focus away from things like autocomplete that need to keep focus elsewhere (the input)
[08:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> this is for an always open menu?
[08:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> got a desktop example?
[08:08:53] <kborchers> hmmm
[08:14:19] <kborchers> can't think of one ... this is from a todo that i believe jzaefferer added.
[08:15:14] <kborchers> i think it is only for always visible menus, yes. menus in menubar and autocomplete all seem to work properly without this change
[08:15:33] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't add it then
[08:15:43] <jzaefferer> the actual issue is this:
[08:15:48] <scott_gonzalez> do we have an actual use case?
[08:16:12] <jzaefferer> focus a menu so that cursor key navigation works
[08:16:20] <jzaefferer> mouseover an item, then use cursor keys to scroll
[08:16:36] <jzaefferer> once it scrolls down or up, it'll move focus back to whatever item is hovered
[08:16:45] <jzaefferer> without moving the mouse
[08:16:55] <scott_gonzalez> that's a mousemove bug, isn't it?
[08:17:23] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i think that's a different issue. i'm talking todo #1
[08:17:34] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #101: STILL FAILING in 2 min 38 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/101/
[08:17:37] <kborchers> i think you're talking about todo #2
[08:18:02] <kborchers> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Menu
[08:18:06] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[08:18:09] <jzaefferer> nvm then
[08:18:58] <kborchers> so should i just forget #1 or are we still concerned with that issue?
[08:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'd drop it unless we have an existing use case from the desktop
[08:20:42] <scott_gonzalez> that use case should really be a menubar, not a menu
[08:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> and the menubar should require focus to open
[08:21:09] <kborchers> ok, i'll close the PR and make a note in the wiki that we need a use case if we are going to fix this and move on

[10:45:52] <kborchers> is this somethine we want to "fix" in Menu? "Fix mouseover on menu causing focus to jump around when using cursor keys on scrolling menu"
[10:45:58] <kborchers> Seems like all browsers behave the same firing mouseover on scroll
[10:46:37] <kborchers> and only solution i have come up with in my head seems pretty hacky with mad overhead checking the scroll event all the time
[10:49:49] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: do you know what this is for? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L241-243
[10:52:56] <jzaefferer> kborchers: does that happen for native menus as well?

[10:56:00] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I wonder if one of the demos relies on it
[10:56:11] <jzaefferer> speaking of yelling, scott_gonzalez, are we following jslint currently? rather, do you?

[10:56:38] <scott_gonzalez> neither do I
[10:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> I assume if Eclipse isn't yelling at me, then we're fine :-P

[11:57:35] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer gnarf ^^
[12:05:41] <jzaefferer> kborchers: more flags!!1 /o\
[12:06:05] <kborchers> i know :(
[12:06:21] <jzaefferer> doesn't look hideous, but wondering if it might introduce other issues...
[12:06:30] <kborchers> not sure how else to block mouseover when scrolling
[12:07:32] <jzaefferer> okay, looking again, its actually just the new flag and a check for it
[12:07:33] <kborchers> what issues? visual tests seemed to still work ok in menu and autocomplete
[12:07:38] <jzaefferer> most of the code is just being moved a bit
[12:07:43] <jzaefferer> "seem to" :-)
[12:08:13] <kborchers> only weirdness i have seen is if you mouse over a scrolling menu
[12:08:40] <kborchers> then use the wheel to scroll, element is not activated until you move to another one
[12:09:54] <kborchers> but clicking it still fires select
[12:10:05] <kborchers> units on menu and autocomplete still pass
[12:10:29] <gnarf> hrm - random fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/HNZJV/5/
[12:10:38] <jzaefferer> unrelated, kborchers, got a machine where you could put on Firefox 3.6, IE7 and 8?
[12:10:53] <jzaefferer> would be nice to reach 100% coverage just once...
[12:11:31] <kborchers> i have a 7 vm and an 8 vm here and i could put old FF on one (if it isn't already there)
[12:12:05] <jzaefferer> cool
[12:12:18] <jzaefferer> I've got 5 browsers running on my Win7 machine
[12:12:34] <jzaefferer> someone else is covering current Firefox, Opera and IE6
[12:13:13] <jzaefferer> I can manually trigger builds in Jenkins, so once everything is covered, we could see how far we can get :-)(
[12:14:48] <gnarf> i'll run my ie7 vm on it
[12:14:55] <gnarf> if you wanna cover ie8 :)
[12:15:22] <kborchers> gnarf: cool, i have ie 8 running now and ff 3.6

[12:20:26] <gnarf> ie8 dropped off
[12:20:52] <kborchers> back up
[12:21:07] <kborchers> that bug is annoying
[12:44:59] <kborchers> jzaefferer: so anything else on that Menu scroll thing? anything else you want checked before it gets merged to master?
[12:53:03] <jzaefferer> well, if it actually makes mouse interaction more awkward, it might not be worse it - after all, we're trying to fix an issue that involves using both mouse and keyboard
[12:54:00] <jzaefferer> hey gnarf, I could help a bit of unix support
[12:54:08] <gnarf> sup
[12:54:13] <jzaefferer> I got surprisingly far getting phantomjs running on our swarm server
[12:54:29] <jzaefferer> it needs Xvfb to actually work, and I can't get that to run
[12:54:37] <jzaefferer> following these instructions: http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/XvfbSetup
[12:55:07] <jzaefferer> trying to run that init.d script gives me Permission denied, no matter if I use sudo /..., sudo bash then whatever...
[12:55:29] <gnarf> hrm
[12:55:40] <jzaefferer> its /etc/init.d/xvfb
[12:55:44] <jzaefferer> if you want to take a look
[12:55:47] <gnarf> seems based on x11
[12:55:51] <jzaefferer> that needs to run for phantomjs to work
[12:56:17] <gnarf> which anything x11 based i haven't looked at for a LONG time
[12:56:21] <jzaefferer> Xvfb is already installed...
[12:56:38] <jzaefferer> also got qt4 installed and phantomjs compiled
[12:56:53] <jzaefferer> I had expected a lot more issues along the way :-)
[12:57:02] <gnarf> i don't see anything in /etc/init.d
[12:57:36] <gnarf> other than playing with it, is there a reason we want to get this running?
[12:57:53] <gnarf> doesn't seem like something very useful
[12:58:32] <jzaefferer> maybe its just missing a +x
[12:59:01] <gnarf> that makes sense actually
[12:59:13] <gnarf> cuz i just did /etc/init.d/<tab complete>
[12:59:19] <gnarf> which wouldn't of shown me non-executables
[12:59:31] <gnarf> seems you got it running
[12:59:31] <gnarf> :)
[13:00:42] <jzaefferer> kind of
[13:01:36] <jzaefferer> actually, yes
[13:01:41] <jzaefferer> need to use: DISPLAY=:0 phantomjs <arguments>
[13:03:46] <kborchers> jzaefferer: hmm, not sure which is more awkward, the active element jumping on scroll or the active element not looking active on scroll with mouse wheel
[13:04:22] <kborchers> i think i would say the mouse wheel one is the lesser of two evils imo
[13:08:28] <jzaefferer> so the mousewheel still scrolls, right?
[13:08:38] <kborchers> yep
