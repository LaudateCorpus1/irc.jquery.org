[02:54:44] <arthurvr> Omar-: You mean the CLA check which failed?
[02:55:35] <Omar-> arthurvr yea, anyway I closed it and i'm making another one with better code
[02:55:41] <Omar-> previous code was poor
[02:55:58] <arthurvr> you can update the existing PR ;)
[02:58:00] <arthurvr> Omar-: did you signed the CLA?
[03:00:17] <Omar-> yea long time back
[03:00:28] <Omar-> arthurvr i delete the branch :(
[03:01:06] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Palestinian opened pull request #8077: Added "destroy" method (06master...06patch-2) 02http://git.io/vvuQ4
[03:01:24] <Omar-> failed again :/
[03:37:37] <Omar-> arthurvr I signed another CLA
[03:47:25] <arthurvr> Omar-: let me take a look
[03:48:24] <arthurvr> Omar-: Travis failed because you should use the jQuery Javascript style guide. http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/
[03:49:06] <arthurvr> I see spaces, single quotes and an unused variable.
[03:53:48] <arthurvr> Omar-: The last name you gave up is invalid, thatâ€™s why the CLA check fails.
[03:59:11] <Omar-> arthurvr good points. I'll try to edit it
[03:59:14] <Omar-> thanks :)
[03:59:36] <arthurvr> Omar-: Weâ€™ll need both a valid signature and you will need to update your git config. Thank you!
[04:00:07] <Omar-> git config? how? I'm ignorant lol
[04:00:42] <arthurvr> Omar-: You can read up on http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/status/?repo=jquery-mobile&sha=01238cb4d394553f735a11c31593acee150044fa#updating-git-config :) 
[04:01:50] <Omar-> arthurvr hmmmm..where should I run that code?
[04:02:24] <arthurvr> Omar-: On your local system in the branch for your PR.
[04:05:08] <Omar-> ok arthurvr I have Git shell active now
[04:06:05] <arthurvr> well navigate to the repo (your fork I mean) and checkout the branch you created when preparing the PR.
[04:06:56] <Omar-> ok
[04:07:08] <Omar-> sounds like mission impossible for me
[04:07:09] <Omar-> lol
[04:07:14] <Omar-> i'll try
[04:07:17] <Omar-> pray for me!
[04:07:18] <Omar-> haha
[04:07:21] <arthurvr> haha :)
[04:12:46] <Omar-> waiting for download to finish
[04:13:06] <Omar-> i have cloned the entire project
[04:13:13] <arthurvr> hmm, donâ€™t you already have it downloaded?
[04:13:25] <arthurvr> How have you created the PR otherwise lol
[04:14:19] <Omar-> i did it from github.com directly
[04:16:31] <arthurvr> So you didnâ€™t run the tests or any linting or so lol?
[04:22:20] <Omar-> arthurvr "null" lol
[04:24:03] <Omar-> arthurvr Ive updated git config for username and email
[04:24:28] <Omar-> the next step isnt clear
[04:24:45] <Omar-> i'm just not experienced with all this stuff
[04:26:16] <arthurvr> did you already update your commit with the new info? You need to amend it and then force push the commit as the page explains
[04:33:01] <Omar-> arthurvr how can I know if info is updated?
[04:37:10] <arschmitz> Omar-: i hate to tell you but we are not accepting new features on slider
[04:39:41] <Omar-> it's okay arschmitz
[04:40:03] <arschmitz> Omar our slider is going to be replaced by a re-written UI one
[04:42:43] <Omar-> arschmitz i look forward to seeing new updates
[04:42:49] <Omar-> good luck!
[04:42:59] <Omar-> now how can I detele both PR's?
[04:44:42] <arschmitz> just close them
[04:45:46] <Omar-> ok
[04:46:09] <Omar-> done
[04:46:17] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Palestinian closed pull request #8077: Added "destroy" method (06master...06patch-2) 02http://git.io/vvuQ4
[04:53:11] <arschmitz> Omar-: sorry about that but in general its a good idea to wait for feed back on the issue before adding a new feature
[05:03:24] <Omar-> arschmitz I thought destroy method should be added by default to any widget
[05:03:36] <arschmitz> it should
[05:03:46] <arschmitz> but its never been there
[05:03:59] <arschmitz> it was left out intentionally originally
[05:04:16] <Omar-> oh ok I thought so
[05:04:20] <arschmitz> and we dont add anything new to widgets we are removing
[05:04:56] <arschmitz> we only fix bugs on them and this is not a big
[05:04:57] <arschmitz> bug
[05:05:26] <Omar-> are you planning to use flexbox for controlgroup?
[05:05:35] <arschmitz> No
[05:05:53] <arschmitz> we cant use flex box the browser support is not good enough
[05:14:48] <Omar-> at least for grade-A
[05:14:56] <Omar-> controlgroup will look better
[05:15:30] <Omar-> arschmitz I used it in http://jsbin.com/yunuhu/

[12:28:38] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers: Ping!
[12:39:58] <rxaviers> gabriel_schulhof, hello
[12:47:14] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers: Hey!
[12:47:53] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers: So, I was simply running npm install download.jqueryui.com and I found that a bunch of (indirect) dependencies fail to compile under node v0.12.2
[12:48:47] <rxaviers> servers use 0.10
[12:49:37] <gabriel_schulhof> *sigh* ... OK ... I switched to 0.12 for another project I was working on ...
[12:51:08] <rxaviers> what problems do you get?
[12:52:11] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers: Working on a gist ...
[12:53:03] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/5198636ada9d18d5ae23
[12:54:48] <rxaviers> ouch
[12:55:19] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers: Yeah ... basically, it looks like it doesn't work with v0.12
[12:55:21] <rxaviers> it doesnt seem very trivial unless a dependency bump could fix it
[12:55:40] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers: Right.
[12:56:05] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers: I can grab the DB repo and see if bumping any dep will fix it.
[12:56:13] <rxaviers> awesome
[12:56:19] <rxaviers> then, just let me know
[12:56:33] <rxaviers> if it solves the problem, we test if the bump keeps working fine on 0.10
[12:57:04] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[12:59:36] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers: *sigh* ... simple-log, to which the problematic dependency belongs, has no version newer than 1.1.0 - though since it's scott_gonzalez' repo, maybe I can send him a PR.
[13:00:14] <rxaviers> ok
[13:02:50] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers: OK, so, the bottom of the dep list is node-syslog, the latest version of which is the one we're using, and it was published two years ago :)
[13:04:32] <gabriel_schulhof> rxaviers: I'll have a look at nvm to switch between versions of node.
[13:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> gabriel_schulhof: I'm happy to switch to a different syslog module if you find one that support 0.10 and 0.12.
[13:06:16] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: OK.
[13:06:27] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll dig.
[13:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[13:06:53] <gabriel_schulhof> NP! I'm happy to do it.
[14:07:41] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Hurray for winston-syslog-posix ... it builds with both 0.10 and 0.12 ... I'll try to make a PR.
[14:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> Well, adding Winston as a dependency isn't realistic.
[14:14:31] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Why not? It seems to install easily enough ...
[14:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> Adding an entire logging system to avoid the use of an entire logging system defeats the entire purpose of the module.
[18:36:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: scott_gonzalez: node-syslog supports node 0.12 on master was updated mid February. it looks like they just decided to stop tagging back in January 2013 for some reason. plenty of commits since then though :-/
