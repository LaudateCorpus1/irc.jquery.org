[12:37:32] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: What's the state of jscs allowing identifiers from external APIs?
[12:37:46] <jzaefferer> I just ran into that, with the compare_size grunt task
[12:41:47] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: also for requiring blank lines in front of comments, feature request: https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs/issues/598
[12:57:23] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: looks like your commit introduced a test failure in IE8: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3482
[12:57:35] <jzaefferer> the previous build didn't have that, the two builds since then both have it
[12:58:31] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: hmm
[12:59:49] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah its a test i added failing in ie8 it looks like
[13:01:43] <jzaefferer> well, fix it :-)
[13:01:53] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: working on it
[13:02:00] <jzaefferer> still sucks that we don't have notifications for this...
[13:02:12] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i was just thinking the same
[13:03:33] <arschmitz> i wish browserstack was faster lol
[13:04:12] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i wonder if i should just rebase button onto petersendidit classes branch now
[13:04:19] <jzaefferer> yeah, that would also help
[13:04:34] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: you can give it a try and see how many conflicts you get
[13:04:39] <arschmitz> that way we dont get button basicly done then have to change everything for classes option
[13:04:52] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: oh ill get a lot im sure but they should be manageable
[13:05:09] <arschmitz> because both branches are up to date with master
[13:05:42] <arschmitz> and button has a very clean commit history at this point 
[13:07:26] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: but first it would be awesome if browserstack would actually go fast enough to load the widget test page :)
[13:10:49] <rxaviers> arschmitz, https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-runner/issues/91
[13:11:15] <rxaviers> jzaefferer and I have figured the issue I was having.. Hope it helps you out as well.
[13:11:33] <arschmitz> rxaviers: ill try that thanks
[13:11:38] <rxaviers> :)
[13:13:34] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: any idea why in ie8 this.window[0] is not equal to window?
[13:16:36] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: seems like doing this.window[ 0 ] === window is not enough for that test in ie8 it needs the full this.document[0].defaultView || this.document[0].parentWindow
[13:18:43] <jzaefferer> so how would the assertion look like in the end?
[13:18:57] <jzaefferer> Its kind of pointless to replicate the code you're testing in the test
[13:19:04] <arschmitz> strictEqual( this.window[0], this.document[0].defaultView || this.document[0].parentWindow, "this.window is properly defined" );
[13:19:04] <arschmitz> 			strictEqual( this.document[0], document, "this.document is properly defined" );
[13:19:17] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its not its really just checking that its set at all
[13:19:38] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: because it previously was not set at that point
[13:20:06] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: so really just checking that its defined would in theory be enough here
[13:25:46] <jzaefferer> Well, that first assertion looks questionable, but probably still better then just doing ok( this.window )
[13:26:23] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i only meant to past the first one the second one works fine
[13:26:43] <arschmitz> and yes its clearly not what i had wanted but ie fails otherwise
[13:31:59] <jzaefferer> You can put a support comment in front of it, indicating what it should look like when we drop IE8
[13:32:18] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sure
[13:32:50] <arschmitz> ill do that in just a sec so i can fix master :)

[16:05:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: arschmitz was doing more extensive testing. He figured out that a == b works, so we'll switch to equal() with a support comment.
[16:06:27] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i was trying to figure out WHY this was happening because it made no sense to me
[16:06:59] <arschmitz> still does not but equal seems a lot more sane
