[05:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: You should rebase on master.
[05:34:49] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally we'd be able to fast forward when we're ready to merge.
[05:34:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that's what i did
[05:36:01] <kborchers> i think it's ok since it says the pr can be automatically merged â€¦ i don't use that button but do use it as a sign that the branch is going to merge easily. usually works
[05:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, looks like you did it right.
[05:37:19] <kborchers> ok, cool
[05:37:56] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....no
[05:38:02] <kborchers> :(
[05:38:03] <scott_gonzalez> The PR should still only show 3 commits.
[05:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> wait
[05:38:23] <scott_gonzalez> How many commits did you have in that branch?
[05:38:47] <kborchers> probably about 10 or 12 i think
[05:38:49] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like three ended up at the top
[05:38:55] <scott_gonzalez> And the rest are still at the bottom.
[05:39:02] <kborchers> hmmm
[05:39:14] <kborchers> i have no idea how to fix this either
[05:40:02] <kborchers> i guess i could just rebranch master and cherry-pick over my progressbar commits and kill this branch once merged?
[05:40:31] <scott_gonzalez> USE THE FORCE!
[05:40:43] <scott_gonzalez> I just fixed it.

[05:41:03] <kborchers> hah! nice :)
[05:41:04] <kborchers> thanks
[05:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure how you got into that state.
[05:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> All I did was checkout progressbar and rebase master.
[05:41:33] <kborchers> weird
[05:41:49] <kborchers> probably did something stupid. it was late
[05:44:33] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #81: STILL FAILING in 28 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/81/
[08:00:07] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi, In the UI api docs, in your widget list, do you use the exact widget name or do you use common names? (e.g. if for a checkbox, the widget name is checkboxradio, do you use checkbox or checkboxradio?) (on the list on http://api.jqueryui.com/category/widgets/)
[08:00:43] <scott_gonzalez> It needs to be the widget name.
[08:02:39] <kborchers> gnarf: ping
[08:02:42] <kborchers> call?
[08:23:06] <mikesherov> Woah
[08:23:12] <mikesherov> why did this get closed: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8763
[08:23:32] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: this is clearly a bug: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8763
[08:29:55] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: make you look at this ticket: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8763
[08:30:05] <kborchers> mikesherov: hmm, yeah that does seem like a bug when reading it but without a test case (which i don't have time to write now) it's hard to tell
[08:30:06] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: soonish!
[08:30:16] <mikesherov> What? Hard to tell?
[08:30:17] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: also, "make"?
[08:30:24] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: can*
[08:30:33] <jzaefferer> heh, okay
[08:30:44] <jzaefferer> "make the force be with you!"
[08:30:52] <jzaefferer> that actually makes more sense
[08:30:55] <kborchers> mikesherov: yeah, seems wrong
[08:31:04] <mikesherov> it's clearly a bug. Just because OP doesn't have a test case, doesn't mean we should close.
[08:31:24] <mikesherov> I mean, right?
[08:31:39] <kborchers> mikesherov: i agree with that â€¦ i was just saying i couldn't verify it without seeing it happen. i would not have closed it
[08:31:40] <mikesherov> I'm legitimately curious to know what the policy is here
[08:31:44] <mikesherov> kborchers: sure
[08:33:29] <mikesherov> So, do I reopen it?
[08:33:49] <mikesherov> At the very least, we can attempt to make the change and see if it break any existing units!
[08:33:57] <kborchers> that's probably not my call. scott_gonzalez is out. jzaefferer ?
[08:35:24] <kborchers> mikesherov: i would say for something like that you'll want to check visual tests / demos in addition to units
[08:35:37] <mikesherov> ah, I see
[08:35:42] <mikesherov> that's a good call
[08:35:49] <mikesherov> Anyway, I'm going to steal the ticket
[08:36:00] <mikesherov> Hopefully, no one minds considering it's currently closed
[08:36:01] <kborchers> i don't think anyone will object
[08:37:37] <mikesherov> k, thanks
[08:39:11] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: you're welcome to fix actual bugs. Certainly wouldn't be the first ticket that Scott closed and later got reopened and fixed. Though I didn't yet get the "bug" either
[08:39:53] <kborchers> jzaefferer: it's not applying the scrollbar width to the correct side
[08:40:01] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: the only thing I can point out is the assumption in position's code that vertical scrollbarWidth() === horizontal scrollbarHeight()
[08:40:39] <jzaefferer> the width should be always the same, independent of the orientation
[08:40:40] <kborchers> position hurts my head
[08:40:49] <kborchers> now it doesn't seem wrong when i read it
[08:40:58] <jzaefferer> if you think of widthxlength, not widthxheight
[08:41:08] <jzaefferer> width * length
[08:41:13] <mikesherov> so it's right?
[08:41:17] <mikesherov> :-P
[08:41:34] <jzaefferer> if that's what he's talking about, he's wrong :-)
[08:42:44] <kborchers> mikesherov: i think it's correct as is
[08:42:55] <kborchers> wiat no
[08:42:56] <kborchers> GOD!
[08:43:01] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll petersendidit mikesherov: I'm so glad about finally having a triaging team on UI. Having a first line of defense helps so much focusing on actual issues.
[08:45:53] <tj_vantoll> Glad to help, I enjoy it actually.
[08:46:38] <jzaefferer> Even better :-)
[08:46:47] <jzaefferer> Much better on the long run
[09:57:35] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Reading that again, I see what he's saying.
[09:58:50] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, it took a few reads for me but i do think it needs to be swapped
[09:59:00] <kborchers> haven't tested though
[09:59:21] <scott_gonzalez> The code looks backward.
[09:59:29] <scott_gonzalez> ( overflowX === "auto" && within.width < within.element[0].scrollWidth )
[10:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> That part seems legit.
[10:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> right?
[10:00:19] <scott_gonzalez> So it's just the width/height setting in the return value.
[10:01:01] <kborchers> yes, i think it's just the return that's the issue
[10:01:26] <kborchers> width should check overflowY and height should check overflowX
[10:01:37] <kborchers> hasOverflowX/Y
[10:02:27] <kborchers> the weird part is i swear the visual tests looked right as is :/
[10:02:38] <kborchers> causing collision on the scrollbars
[10:02:44] <kborchers> not behind them
[10:06:03] <gnarf> damn
[10:06:05] <gnarf> no nacin today
[10:06:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do you know if we need to do anything special after we add a site to the list of sites to get it to "install" properly the database for it?
[10:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I believe you just add it to the list then go to the site.
[10:07:45] <gnarf> thats my memory too
[10:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> The first time you go to the site it should do the install behind the scenes.
[10:08:06] <gnarf> but last time I remember nacin saying he needed to fix something about that
[10:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> Order matters.
[10:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> He stuck the new blog in the middle of the array.
[10:09:13] <scott_gonzalez> But now he sorts on  blog_id, so it doesn't matter.
[10:09:38] <scott_gonzalez> Although having them out of order means you need to scan for the largest number to know what value to use for the new site...
[10:10:07] <scott_gonzalez> I belive the next would be 18.
[10:12:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think the reason for making it non-existing system is to make it as easy as possible for nelson to get the site up and running
[10:12:22] <gnarf> cc ajpiano
[10:12:57] <ajpiano> i just replied in github, it's what gnarf said but other things too
[11:06:08] <_|Nix|_> Hi! Could somebody please unmoderate #jquery-meeting for the jQM meeting?
[11:50:50] <kswedberg> ajpiano: Are we moving http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions to the learn site? There's a link to it in the API docs somewhere, and I want to know what to do with it.
[11:51:43] <RWhitbeck> kswedberg I moved what made sense during the summit
[11:52:08] <kswedberg> RWhitbeck: cool! link?
[11:52:14] <RWhitbeck> http://stage.learn.jquery.com/faq/
[11:52:26] <kswedberg> thx
[11:54:19] <kswedberg> RWhitbeck: what about old Release Notes? Should we throw those into blog.jquery.com and give them their old publish date? (e.g. http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.3.2)
[11:55:23] <RWhitbeck> Makes sense to me.  I have a feeling they are already there?
[11:57:29] <kswedberg> Hmm. Looks like there's a blog entry, but it's just a summary (http://blog.jquery.com/2009/02/20/jquery-132-released/) "See the 1.3.2 Release Notes for full details"
[11:58:34] <RWhitbeck> *shudder* "If you wish to checkout the full release from the Subversion repository, you can do so by following the following instructions and checking out the source from the following location:
[11:58:34] <RWhitbeck> svn co http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.3.2"
[11:59:10] <kswedberg> haha. at least it's still there.
[11:59:40] <gnarf> RWhitbeck: is there already an issue for the messed up quotes on http://stage.learn.jquery.com/effects/custom-effects/ ?
[12:00:01] <RWhitbeck> yeahâ€¦that's a build issue ajpiano is working on
[12:25:51] <ajpiano> gnarf: yeah all i have to do is update to latest grunt-jquery-content and push to stage
[12:31:30] <gnarf> ajpiano: cool, didn't want to report a dupe

[15:33:38] <ajpiano> kswedberg:  if we're gonna go back and do anything, we should probably add release notes for jquery versions directly to jquery.com
[15:34:04] <ajpiano> ala https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/tree/master/page/changelog
[15:38:41] <gnarf> ajpiano: +1
[15:39:42] <ajpiano> gnarf: http://stage.learn.jquery.com/effects/custom-effects/
[15:40:08] <gnarf> ajpiano: nicer, comments still seem screwy
[15:40:34] <ajpiano> on that particular article hm yea
[15:40:45] <ajpiano> there's an opening quote in those leading comments which is making things not too happy
[16:01:21] <kswedberg> ajpiano: I haven't looked at jquery.com yet. is it set up to handle adding a bunch of pages to it yet?
[16:01:41] <ajpiano> ostensibly.... that's what's powering the existing pages
[16:02:10] <ajpiano> e.g., http://jquery.com/download/ is https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/blob/master/pages/download.html
[16:03:02] <kswedberg> ah. I see.
[16:03:26] <kswedberg> I didn't realize the live site was being powered by the git repo
[16:05:06] <ajpiano> heading to dinner, catch you in a bit kswedberg
[16:05:15] <kswedberg> k.
[16:05:21] <kswedberg> bye, ajpiano
[17:00:30] <kborchers> mikesherov: if you get a chance, check your e-mail re: your triage work
[17:37:53] <mikesherov> kborchers: will get it to you tonight
[17:38:07] <kborchers> mikesherov: cool, thanks
[17:38:31] <mikesherov> the ticketgraph tells the story, but I'll get you some nerdy numbers to geek out on
[17:38:44] <mikesherov> also, you should mention snover, as he's the real triage guy
[17:38:50] <mikesherov> I'm just following his lead
[17:38:56] <mikesherov> he invented everythin
[17:39:01] <mikesherov> everything*
[17:40:02] <kborchers> mikesherov: ok will do â€¦ you had some help too from petersendidit and tj_vantoll, correct? or was that something else?
[17:40:22] <mikesherov> oh yeah, they were great
[17:40:44] <mikesherov> for sure
[17:41:03] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph is one story
[17:41:34] <mikesherov> tells the other half: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/timeline?from=11%2F02%2F12&daysback=21&authors=&ticket=on&ticket_details=on&update=Update
[17:41:48] <mikesherov> I'm just going to compile that
[17:43:56] <kborchers> cool, i have an image of the ticket graph over the last year â€¦ yeah some numbers from that timeline would be perfect
[17:45:18] <kborchers> mikesherov: thanks again for helping with this
[17:45:32] <mikesherov> no problem! It's my pleasure
[17:45:48] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph has a days parameter, btw
[17:45:55] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph?days=365 is the past year
[17:45:59] <mikesherov> kborchers: ^
[17:46:40] <kborchers> mikesherov: yep, that's what i'm using
[17:47:01] <mikesherov> cool
[17:57:38] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: kborchers: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/802
[17:58:29] <mikesherov> kborchers: almost done cleaning up the test suite
[17:58:42] <kborchers> that's awesome
[17:58:58] <mikesherov> I have a few fails to track down and the interactions are all geared up for a ruthless round of closing pull requests
[18:42:59] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer gnarf if you were to point out the major highlights of the changes to widget factory in 1.9, what would you say? _delay, _destroy, _super/_superApply, _on/_off, anything else? less?
[18:43:40] <mikesherov> kborchers: Can I send you the updated stats in the AM EST?
[18:43:52] <mikesherov> that's like 12 hours from now?
[18:44:27] <kborchers> mikesherov: yeah, that's fine. i'll just keep a placeholder slide for it, then drop your stuff in before sending them off
[18:45:25] <mikesherov> OK
