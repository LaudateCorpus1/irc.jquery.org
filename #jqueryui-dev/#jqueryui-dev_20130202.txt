[07:49:43] <DavidSullivan> scott_gonzalez, I don't thing that we should make the changes we discussed yesterday for bug 5454
[07:49:48] <DavidSullivan> scott_gonzalez, http://jsperf.com/label-selector-test
[08:53:39] <DavidSullivan> when I run grunt after doing git pull upstream master  it just comes back with no output
[09:17:36] <DavidSullivan> can anyone run this test for me in IE and\or safari
[09:17:47] <DavidSullivan> http://jsperf.com/label-selector-test/2
[09:34:43] <DavidSullivan> anyone on to discuss a button performance issue?
[10:34:20] <djQuery> ajpiano, you got a sec to discuss a .button performance issue
[10:34:44] <ajpiano> possibly?
[10:34:50] <djQuery> what do we do when changes make it work faster in most browser just not ie
[10:35:12] <djQuery> http://jsperf.com/label-selector-test/2
[10:35:42] <ajpiano> does it make it slower in ie ?
[10:36:33] <ajpiano> or just about the same
[10:36:48] <djQuery> just baout the same slightly slower on older ie
[10:36:53] <djQuery> 9 is fine
[10:37:00] <djQuery> havent been able to test 10
[10:37:52] <ajpiano> hmm
[10:37:59] <ajpiano> that is something of philosophical question
[10:38:05] <djQuery> http://jsperf.com/label-selector-test
[10:38:10] <ajpiano> yeah i mean
[10:38:26] <djQuery> heck with <9?
[10:39:10] <ajpiano> running it now in ie myself
[10:42:21] <ajpiano> djQuery: which one is the current methodology
[10:42:58] <ajpiano> djQuery: the thing that's fastest in chrome is also fastest in ie8
[10:43:21] <ajpiano> .siblings().filter(...
[10:43:55] <djQuery> ajpiano, after traversing up .parents().all()  it does .find(label[for="id"])
[10:44:25] <djQuery> I was thinking I need to reorder the code so that it searches siblings first
[10:44:33] <djQuery> before going up the tree
[10:45:19] <ajpiano> that seeems to be faster everywhere though, so as long as everything still works ostensibly you should go with it
[10:45:43] <djQuery> but I dont know how searching siblings will work when it is disconnected from the dom
[10:45:49] <ajpiano> ohhhhhhhhh
[10:45:59] <djQuery> $('<input>',)
[10:46:23] <djQuery> but realy that shouldn't work in any case unless the is a container it has been attached to
[10:46:56] <djQuery> line 232 of jquery.ui.button.js if you want to look at it with me
[10:47:29] <ajpiano> looking now
[10:47:50] <djQuery> thinking of just reordering it to where it search siblings first then searches parents().last()
[10:48:13] <djQuery> hey lets to the fastes thing first
[10:51:19] <ajpiano> hmm
[10:51:28] <ajpiano> i think that would probably add unneeded complexity
[10:53:20] <ajpiano> cause you'd have to fork the assignment on 235 somehow
[10:53:35] <ajpiano> to say like, if i have siblings, look there, if i do, use that, if i don't, do the normal route
[10:54:34] <djQuery> basicaly yes switching the order of the if there
[10:56:07] <djQuery> by the way this is in refence to http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5454
[10:58:40] <ajpiano> fontzter said it had "negligible benefit" to search the sblings first
[10:59:22] <ajpiano> also
[10:59:37] <ajpiano> this might have already improved by virture of the fact that it now explicitly searches only for labels
[11:00:04] <ajpiano> i don't know though
[11:02:12] <djQuery> ajpiano, in modern browsers yes it appears that adding laebel helped
[11:04:08] <ajpiano> i wonder if making it .find("label").filter(...) would help
[11:04:31] <djQuery> ajpiano, that is in one of the tests
[11:04:39] <ajpiano> oh woops
[11:04:46] <ajpiano> guess not
[11:04:55] <ajpiano> it's hard to perf test this in insolation also
[11:05:06] <ajpiano> because it can be sooo different depending on the structure of the particular page
[11:06:19] <djQuery> ajpiano, so maybe thats what we need to look at what is the common structure
[11:06:39] <djQuery> I used to allways do <label><input/></label>
[11:06:49] <djQuery> but that is not supported by .button
[11:06:55] <ajpiano> me too but sometimes it straight up don't work
[11:07:23] <djQuery> so now I always do <label for=></label><input id= />
[11:07:44] <ajpiano> i hate how the only way you can specify labels is with ids
[11:07:46] <ajpiano> it drives me nuts
[11:08:03] <ajpiano> aside from wrapping
[11:10:10] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/emavid/2/edit
[11:10:54] <ajpiano> yea, granted
[11:10:57] <djQuery> ajpiano, to make selecting the labels easier I have done <label id="lblInputID" for="InputID"? >
[11:11:40] <djQuery> in your opinion are they usualy a sibling in which case we need to change the if, or is it something else
[11:12:56] <ajpiano> i wish we had one of these dramatically bad DOMs
[11:13:00] <ajpiano> to see where it realy slows down
[11:15:02] <djQuery> especialy with the new chrome dev tools to inspect it
[11:15:10] <ajpiano> it's weird how the current code
[11:15:17] <ajpiano> checks the entire DOM first, and then looks at siblings
[11:15:27] <ajpiano> i'd tend to think that just looking at siblings first
[11:15:30] <ajpiano> would be the way to speed it up
[11:18:29] <djQuery> ajpiano, thats it thats what I am going to change it to
[11:18:35] <ajpiano> worth a shot for sure
[11:24:41] <djQuery> how do you add a command to bot-t again
[11:25:03] <djQuery> I used to have all the ?ui.module name listed in him but he seems to have forgoten
[11:25:26] <ajpiano> oh bot-t
[11:25:30] <ajpiano> is about to be decomissioned
[11:25:40] <djQuery> ???????????????/
[11:25:42] <ajpiano> you should tell b-ot
[11:25:49] <ajpiano> if you are adding new facts
[11:25:53] <ajpiano> it's basically the samet hing
[11:25:56] <djQuery> how am I gonna do ?demo
[11:25:59] <ajpiano> just maintained by people who actually exist
[11:26:00] <ajpiano> `demo
[11:26:01] <b-ot> ajpiano: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:26:34] <djQuery> so is b-ot the new bot-t?
[11:26:34] <bot-t> djQuery, Stored "so".
[11:26:53] <djQuery> bot-t forget so
[11:33:02] <ajpiano> djQuery: yea

[13:19:11] <djQuery> mine is just full of errors
[13:53:33] <djQuery> ajpiano, you still there? http://jsbin.com/ezorib/5/edit
[13:53:38] <djQuery> take a look at that please
[13:57:52] <djQuery> think I shaved a little time but not enough 
[13:58:23] <djQuery> it just means that now it is going to be slower still when say the label is in a td other than the td that the input is in
