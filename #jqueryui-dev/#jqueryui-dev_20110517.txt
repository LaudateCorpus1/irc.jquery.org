[05:09:58] <mickael_> scott_gonzalez : thanks for your email answer
[05:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> heh, what was the email about?
[05:13:37] * scott_gonzalez gets lots of email
[05:14:46] <mickael_> about the autocomplete and the change event not fire when you submit a form
[05:15:56] <mickael_> i resolved my problem. I create a specific event i fired before submit the form
[05:23:44] <scott_gonzalez> oh, is that the one that I said to use the forum a little bit ago?
[05:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> I don't answer questions in private
[05:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> it doesn't help the community
[05:24:12] <mickael_> ook i understand
[05:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it's a scale issue
[06:12:36] <mickael_> why scale ? i have not a lot of other solution

[07:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> we've got a breaking change in tabs right now :-/
[07:40:35] <scott_gonzalez> the load event used to pass DOM elements
[07:40:38] <scott_gonzalez> now it passes jQuery objects
[07:41:02] <scott_gonzalez> the load event is the only problem because it's the only event that has the same name in 1.8 and 2.0

[11:44:02] <borismoore> jzaefferer: Just pinged you on Skype. Wondering if I can touch base for a minute re IRC tomorrow...
[11:58:22] <jzaefferer> hey borismoore, yeah, still trying to get a grip on too many TODOs :-)
[11:58:51] <borismoore> Ok, cool, np. If you have time later, just ping me...
[11:58:59] <jzaefferer> among which: scott_gonzalez, any thoughts on the syntax for event delegation in widget factory? still against backbone-styled "magic" strings?
[12:00:47] <scott_gonzalez> are you thinking of just another syntax for ._bind()?
[12:01:36] <jzaefferer> this
[12:01:37] <jzaefferer> so then the question would mostly be about syntax
[12:01:37] <jzaefferer> 9:54 PM
[12:01:37] <jzaefferer> Backbone.js has an event property on views: events: { "click .selector": "method" }
[12:01:37] <jzaefferer> 9:54 PM
[12:01:37] <jzaefferer> not a fan of those magic strings in general, but it makes for pretty succinct syntax
[12:01:38] <jzaefferer> 9:55 PM
[12:01:38] <jzaefferer> e.g. ._bind({ "click button": "method" } in widget factory context
[12:01:39] <jzaefferer> 9:55 PM
[12:01:39] <jzaefferer> very straightforward to parse
[12:01:40] <jzaefferer> 9:56 PM
[12:01:40] <jzaefferer> and working on Mobile SoundCloud with Backbone.js for a few months now, I can't remember any issue, e.g. bug, due to that stuff
[12:47:09] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master Scott González * ad53b55 (4 files in 2 dirs): Tabs: Fixed load event with back compat enabled. - http://bit.ly/lGvZZ2
[12:47:19] <jzaefferer> ping scott_gonzalez
[12:47:29] <jzaefferer> now that you've fixed tabs, let's do this!
[12:48:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't like the events property
[12:48:17] <jzaefferer> why?
[12:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> because it has no benefit over calling ._bind() inside _create()
[12:48:51] <scott_gonzalez> but it increases the API
[12:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> and causes two (actually three) ways of binding events
[12:49:39] <scott_gonzalez> it can't be used for everything
[12:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> like you can't use it for accordion or tabs
[12:52:48] <jzaefferer> err
[12:52:49] <jzaefferer> sorry
[12:52:54] <jzaefferer> I don't want to add the event property
[12:53:07] <jzaefferer> just want to extend _bind
[12:53:22] <jzaefferer> _bind({ "click button": "method" }
[12:55:08] <jzaefferer> what about that scott_gonzalez
[12:55:22] <scott_gonzalez> that's fine
[12:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> ._bind() already accepts a selector
[12:58:44] <jzaefferer> right, but as context, not as delegation target
[12:58:57] <jzaefferer> so the change would be...
[12:59:24] <jzaefferer> here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L306
[12:59:42] <jzaefferer> match the event name against a regex to split it into event and selector
[12:59:53] <jzaefferer> if there is a selector, use delegate, otherwise stick with bind
[12:59:56] <scott_gonzalez> no, just split on space
[13:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> there's shouldn't be a whitelist of events
[13:00:31] <jzaefferer> regex is for splitting on just the first space
[13:00:34] <jzaefferer> selector can be complex
[13:01:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:01:23] <jzaefferer> see http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/backbone.html look for " delegateEvents :"
[13:01:35] <jzaefferer> regex: var eventSplitter = /^(\w+)\s*(.*)$/;
[13:02:00] <jzaefferer> makes sense?
[13:02:40] <jzaefferer> I'd say we'd get the best of both approaches. Easy delegation support ala backbone or jsmvc, and much more explicit and therefore dynamic approach
[13:04:58] <jzaefferer> the difficult part will be the unit test
[13:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> make sure it works with nested tabs
[13:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> or nested accordions
[13:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> that's the tricky part
[13:13:05] <jzaefferer> well, it doesn't have to work everywhere as long as I can replace backbone views with the widget factory
[13:13:08] <jzaefferer> but yeah, I'll test that

[13:24:47] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: you should be able to handle nested widgets with $( event.target ).closest( ":namespace-widget" ).is( this.element )
[14:14:16] <gnarf> hey guys
[14:14:30] <gnarf> whats goin on in ui-dev today?
[15:18:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: any thoughts on how we want to handle pulling in the new $.Color ?
[15:19:12] <gnarf> should we just include the source of color in effects.core again? I'm not a huge fan of doing that...
[15:19:46] <gnarf> but short of making it depend on color / playing with the package builder -- *shrugs*
[15:20:28] <gnarf> the new $.Color is a tad bigger than the old color
[17:05:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: it'll be pulled in to the externals directory
[17:05:53] <gnarf> coo
[17:06:37] <gnarf> i'm trying to find a replacement for the big object full of named colors
[17:07:06] <gnarf> or at least a better compression for it
[17:07:25] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/v6ubF/8/ -- this is the only method I can find for reliable IE detection tho
[17:07:32] <gnarf> createPopup() :(
[17:08:26] <gnarf> browsers supporting getComputedStyle always give rgb/hex back
[17:08:37] <gnarf> so, its just a solution for IE thats missing
