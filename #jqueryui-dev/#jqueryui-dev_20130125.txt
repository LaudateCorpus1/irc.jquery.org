[04:06:59] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! Would it be possible to split the definition of :focusable and :tabbable out of core and into a file on its own? It would be useful for providing a better fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5519 ... we'd copy it into jQM just like the widget factory.
[04:08:22] <_|Nix|_> Currently I intercept the focusin and if I find that the destination element e is undesirable, I $( e ).one( "focus", function( e ) { $( e.target ).blur(); } ); and focus an element that's desirable to focus. The problem is that this causes a lot of jumping around.
[04:09:34] <_|Nix|_> I'd prefer to create two lists: One of :tabbable elements which are undesirable, and one of those that are desirabled. Then, I'd temporarily back up the tabindex of the undesirables and set their tabindex to -1. Thus, I'd restrict the focus chain to the desirables.
[04:09:50] <_|Nix|_> When the focus restriction is no longer needed, I'd restore the original focus chain.
[04:10:15] <_|Nix|_> This works much more solidly than my previous solution.
[04:10:23] <_|Nix|_> However, I need :tabbable ...
[04:21:52] <_|Nix|_> I have created a feature request for this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9012

[04:44:57] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: WordPress generally tries to "complete" URLs, for example jqueryui.com/autoc
[04:45:27] <jzaefferer> your comment sounded like there were other links within DB/TR that don't have the trailing slash yet
[04:46:29] <rxaviers> The only two urls we use at jqueryui.com are /download, and /themeroller. All other requests are to urls at download.jqueryui.com

[05:34:44] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8989
[05:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> The idea is that datepicker should append itself to the div.
[05:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> Can you think of any negative side effects to that?
[05:35:30] <tj_vantoll> To the .ui-dialog div?
[05:35:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> Well, in general terms, to the .ui-front div.
[05:36:03] <tj_vantoll> *thinking*
[05:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm 99% sure jzaefferer and I tested that (and even put tooltips on the datepicker) and we didn't see any problems.
[05:36:43] <scott_gonzalez> Though we clearly never implemented the logic for datepicker.
[05:37:07] <tj_vantoll> Does autocomplete do that?
[05:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L324
[05:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> If the appendTo option is null, it search up from the text field for .ui-front.
[05:37:57] <scott_gonzalez> New in 1.10.
[05:39:36] <tj_vantoll> This is a bit silly but what if you had a dialog open and wanted to create a datepicker on the content behind the dialog before you closed it.
[05:40:27] <petersendidit> Then you would just set the focus to that input when the dialog closed
[05:40:31] <scott_gonzalez> You couldn't. This is a modal dialog.
[05:41:24] <tj_vantoll> Ah right.
[05:43:33] <tj_vantoll> The .ui-dialog isn't overflow: hidden anymore so the display seems fine as well.  So, no I can't think of anything else.
[05:43:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that's why we got rid of the overflow :-)
[05:45:06] <scott_gonzalez> We probably shouldn't add an appendTo option to datepicker in 1.10.1
[05:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> So we might need to just add a hack in dialog for now.
[05:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> But the proper fix would be to implement the .ui-front logic in datepicker.
[05:46:24] <tj_vantoll> Seems reasonable to me.

[05:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> Now I feel dirty.
[05:54:22] <petersendidit> Only 1 more ticket for 1.10.1
[05:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> Should be an easy one.
[05:58:39] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's a one line fix.
[05:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> Use ._appendTo() when appending the overlay.
[05:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> I think djQuery was looking into it.

[06:30:01] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, I just dont know how to build the unit tests
[06:36:53] <djQuery> jzaefferer, http://jsbin.com/ezatot/4/edit
[06:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: BTW, those jsbins are very hard to look at with the full plugin code in the JS section.
[06:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> Have you looked at existing tests to see how they're written?
[06:39:11] <petersendidit> you don't need the || this.document[0].body.  _appendTo() will return the body if it doesn't find anything else
[06:41:58] <djQuery> petersendidit, thanks
[06:42:16] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, I dont even see what directory they are in

[06:57:17] <doesallmagic> Scott Gonz√°lez: Dialog: Allow interaction with datepickers from modal dialogs. Fixes #8989 - Dialog: Cannot change month/year in datepicker within modal.
[07:12:01] <djQuery> what does the expect( 8 ); at the start of a unit test?
[07:14:04] <tj_vantoll> The test expects that there will be 8 assertions, if there are not it will fail.
[07:14:28] <tj_vantoll> http://api.qunitjs.com/expect/
[07:33:18] <djQuery> is this still valid? http://blog.jqueryui.com/2010/05/how-to-submit-a-fix-to-jquery-ui-the-easy-way/
[07:39:06] <petersendidit> yea that looks correct
[08:20:28] <djQuery> won't work for me though as I need to edit the dialog.js and the tests for it as well
[09:23:53] <rpflo> hey guys: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/tCBxp
[09:24:03] <rpflo> I searched the bug tracker, couldn't find anything on this
[09:24:22] <rpflo> going to go make a ticket unless somebody thinks there is one already
[09:30:01] <rpflo> also, lol@php to run the tests ... why?
[09:37:13] <tj_vantoll> fpflo Use collision: 'none' (http://api.jqueryui.com/position/)
[09:38:48] <tj_vantoll> Make that rpflo. ^
[09:39:48] <rpflo> I'm not sure what this has to do with collision though :\
[09:40:36] <rpflo> "Flips the element to the opposite side of the target and the collision detection is run again to see if it will fit. Whichever side allows more of the element to be visible will be used."
[09:40:41] <rpflo> is not what is happening in my test case
[09:41:26] <rpflo> sounds like the collision logic needs to decide if the `of` is even visible
[09:42:09] <tj_vantoll> In your case neither side leaves anything visible.
[09:43:04] <rpflo> right, so it needs to check if the `of` is even visible
[09:43:28] <rpflo> and then do collision logic relative to `of`
[09:52:08] <tj_vantoll> ?tell rpflo I see where you're coming from now.  Feel free to file a bug to get some other opinions.
[09:52:08] <bot-t> tj_vantoll, Okay.
[10:15:48] <djQuery> does this test look correct? http://jsbin.com/ozuvoc/3/edit
[10:16:43] <djQuery> never mind I know it is wrong
[10:17:23] <djQuery> no that should work as it only searches the item that the append was set to
[10:17:51] <djQuery> need to add a 2nd test to verify that it was not added to document.body as well
[10:25:28] <djQuery> sorry had some connection issues     Does this test look correct ? http://jsbin.com/ozuvoc/3/edit
[10:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: Do you have a clone of the repo?
[10:37:38] <scott_gonzalez> Commits or diffs as gists are much easier to look at.
[10:37:54] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, yes, had a few issues getting git setup
[10:38:00] <djQuery> just rebuilt my machine
[10:45:29] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, this better https://gist.github.com/25798cb87b3ea2ca8421
[10:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: A diff is better, so I can see what actually changed ;-)
[10:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> But I can generate a diff by putting that in my working copy.
[10:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> There should probably matching tests for all the other cases.
[10:50:13] <djQuery> kool gimme a few fingering out the commit logic
[10:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> Make all the dialogs modal in that test and verify that the overlays are in the correct location.
[10:59:29] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, so that would leave it with no non modal tests? 
[10:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[10:59:43] <djQuery> cool

[11:43:00] <djQuery> overlay on modal: true only gets created after open right?
[11:44:18] <djQuery> $('.wrap').dialog({modal: true, autoOpen: false, appendTo: '.whatever')  there should or should not be an overlay in whatever at that point?
[12:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> Should not be.
[12:14:14] <djQuery> just gotta fix some of the detached tests
[12:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean by fix the tests?
[12:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> The tests that exist are correct.
[12:20:06] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, the equals that I added to the test to check for the overlay being or not being created correctly were not correct
[12:20:32] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[12:21:06] <djQuery> I modified none of the existing except to add modal: true like you requested
[12:21:35] <djQuery> but they are done now so just need to do a push
[12:22:24] <scott_gonzalez> Great :-)
[12:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> Can you sign the CLA? http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/
[12:53:47] <tj_vantoll> Cool if I update all open 1.10 milestone tickets to 1.11?  aka email bomb you all.

[13:12:04] <b-ot> djQuery: djQuery (9m 43s ago): Dialog: modified _createOverlay to use _AppendTo. Fixed #8984 Modal dialogs display behind overlay when using appendTo option
[13:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Probably set them to none.
[13:14:17] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Do you know about builk update?
[13:14:26] <tj_vantoll> Yeah.
[13:15:25] <tj_vantoll> None because we're not sure exactly what 1.11 will be yet?
[13:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Because otherwise we'll be moving a bunch of tickets again after 1.11 :-P
[13:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> I think that was mikesherov's impetus for adding the none milestone.
[13:21:53] <tj_vantoll> Ok, here goes nothing.
[14:05:56] <mikesherov> HA
[14:06:01] <mikesherov> I love the none milestone
[18:20:52] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: you going to pull djQuery's commit in or should he create a pull request?
[19:52:53] <scott_gonzalez> He should send a PR.
[19:53:57] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, we'll accept it as a commit, but he should learn the proper way to submit fixes.
[23:22:06] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, had to run to work
[23:50:21] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, thanks would rather learn
