[08:29:14] <toddmparker> good morning
[08:30:27] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: looking at your test page
[08:30:35] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[08:31:29] <toddmparker> most of these look solid
[08:31:47] <toddmparker> the issue is finding a size that looks good in the disc. they have to be small
[08:32:22] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah true
[08:32:27] <toddmparker> http://view.jquerymobile.com/grunticon/demos/test/icons/index.html
[08:32:54] <toddmparker> the check needs some tweaking and things that are a box like calendar are a bit too big. circular ones look good
[08:33:18] <toddmparker> are you using these at the exported sizes or did you scale down?
[08:33:29] <uGoMobi> exported size
[08:33:44] <toddmparker> cool
[08:33:51] <toddmparker> ooh, like the icon toggles
[08:34:19] <toddmparker> very cool
[08:34:48] <uGoMobi> actually I like it more without disc
[08:35:05] <uGoMobi> but that's just not possible with a theming system
[08:35:09] <toddmparker> me too
[08:35:34] <toddmparker> as long as we make it easy to drop the disc and show lots of examples
[08:35:59] <toddmparker> if you could choose the icon color per swatch, would that improve matters?
[08:36:49] <uGoMobi> have been thinking about that, but you would probably use something similar... bit darker than the button color
[08:37:01] <uGoMobi> I already reduce opacity of the disc a little bit
[08:37:06] <uGoMobi> reduced*
[08:38:21] <toddmparker> i like the lighter disc
[08:38:35] <uGoMobi> would be cool if you could set icon color per swatch, but I think that's going to be a bit too complex
[08:38:37] <toddmparker> we might want to switch that to a SVG too
[08:38:58] <toddmparker> complex, theme or TR UI-wise?
[08:39:13] <uGoMobi> what is benefit if we use SVG bg instead of bg color?
[08:39:34] <toddmparker> we already flip the text color by default when you drag in so we could apply the same logic and auto-select black or white
[08:40:02] <toddmparker> oh, when i tested list view scrolling perf a while back, the border-radius on each disc was killing perf
[08:40:15] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[08:40:42] <toddmparker> be worth re-checking that. just fire up a 500 list item view and nuke styles - bg gradient, disc, disc radius, etc.
[08:40:46] <uGoMobi> I already replaced some slow CSS selectors so might be worth testing again
[08:41:00] <toddmparker> was surprised by that. figured gradients were bad
[08:41:03] <toddmparker> sure
[08:41:35] <uGoMobi> yeah, didn't know border-radius was such a big performance killer
[08:47:51] <uGoMobi> re: icon color per swatch... it's mostly complex because of the TR
[08:48:15] <toddmparker> gotcha
[08:48:29] <uGoMobi> it would have to generate the icon CSS files with selectors for each theme
[08:48:39] <toddmparker> ah, right. makes sense
[08:51:03] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: now I have been working in grunticon branch for few days I am not sure anymore what is more fuzz...
[08:51:42] <uGoMobi> including the grunticon loader in the jQM JS or tell people to replace link to CSS by a script with link to that CSS
[08:52:43] <uGoMobi> when you see loader script you will probably understand what is going on
[08:53:33] <uGoMobi> but if you just have to remove the link to CSS and then configure an option if you don't use the CSS from the CDN it might be not so clear
[08:54:07] <toddmparker> yeah
[08:54:31] <uGoMobi> also, if you only have to support platforms that support SVG you wouldn't have to change anything, because jquery.mobile.css will contain the SVG data CSS
[08:55:12] <toddmparker> that's true, but svg support is sort of spotty
[08:55:56] <uGoMobi> yes, but if you build an Android 4.0+ or iOS6 app you should be good, right?
[08:56:09] <toddmparker> yep
[09:00:55] <Dragooon> I
[09:01:15] <Dragooon> I'm not sure what's the correct channel to report this, but collapsible seem to have taken a performance hit in between 1.2 and 1.3
[09:01:21] <Dragooon> Testing on Chrome Beta, Nexus 
[09:03:13] <Dragooon> Nexus 4*
[09:03:38] <Dragooon> i.e., they take a much longer to open/close
[09:03:48] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: can you test with latest code and if you still see the problem submit an issue on Github?
[09:03:59] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues
[09:04:24] <Dragooon> By latest code you mean GH master?
[09:04:30] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: we made a lot of changes in latest code that should improve performance
[09:04:40] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: yes
[09:04:52] <Dragooon> Okay, improved performance sounds good. Any chance it comes without new features? :P
[09:05:23] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: without new features?
[09:05:25] <uGoMobi> no :)
[09:05:34] <Dragooon> i.e., new performance less bugs type thing
[09:05:38] <Dragooon> Ah damn. Just waiting for 1.4 beta
[09:06:01] <uGoMobi> 1.4 alpha will be released in the week of July 15
[09:06:23] <Dragooon> Any tentative change log? Damnit, will need to update my theme again
[09:06:30] <uGoMobi> we made big changes so that can't land in a 1.3 maintenance release
[09:07:05] <Dragooon> Any chance a new theme that has less gradients?
[09:07:05] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: there is a 1.4 changelog wiki page on GH
[09:07:10] <uGoMobi> but indeed tentative
[09:07:24] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: 100%
[09:07:29] <Dragooon> Crap :P
[09:07:37] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: new default theme without gradients
[09:07:58] * Dragooon hits his git client
[09:12:30] <Dragooon> Okay, the new theme is pretty great. I can use that
[09:12:42] <Dragooon> I basically made http://smf-media.com/community/?theme=4 on top of jQM
[09:12:49] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: thanks, it's still work in progress
[09:13:08] <uGoMobi> also working on switching to SVG icons
[09:13:35] <Dragooon> That'll help with the whole density thing
[09:13:53] <uGoMobi> yup
[09:14:25] <Dragooon> I just wish Panels were more App like, like they would support partial slide.
[09:14:41] <uGoMobi> Dragoon, nice theme
[09:14:45] <Dragooon> Thanks
[09:15:43] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: yeah, that would be cool and something we will look into in the future
[09:15:57] <Dragooon> Yeah
[09:18:17] <Dragooon> Reported the issue

[09:18:29] <Dragooon> ^ Pretty nifty I guess
[09:19:17] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: did you test with latest code?
[09:19:22] <Dragooon> Yes, same thing
[09:19:39] <Dragooon> It has a noticeable lag even on the master
[09:21:58] <uGoMobi> testing on a Galaxy Nexus now
[09:22:23] <Dragooon> Okay
[09:22:43] <Dragooon> Which browser?
[09:22:58] <uGoMobi> Chrome
[09:23:07] <Dragooon> okay
[09:23:35] <uGoMobi> I deinstalled Chrome Beta because it made Chrome stable crash on my device
[09:24:04] <Dragooon> I haven't used Chrome stable since a while. On any platform
[09:27:01] <uGoMobi> anyways, I do see the difference between 1.1 and 1.3
[09:28:24] <Dragooon> Yeah
[09:29:59] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: can you copy paste the markup of that page in this JS Bin http://jsbin.com/edeluh/1/edit
[09:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You around?
[09:53:49] <rxaviers> yeap
[09:54:08] <scott_gonzalez> That update isn't quite what I meant.
[09:54:17] <rxaviers> oh oh
[09:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> Grab the categories first
[09:54:39] <scott_gonzalez> Then walk the posts.
[09:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> And just add the posts to the categories array as you walk.
[09:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> Using belongsTo() is what seems odd.
[09:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> Just walk the category list for each post and update the manifest as you go.
[09:55:39] <rxaviers> hm I see
[09:56:27] <rxaviers> that's right, we skip the O(2)
[09:56:41] <rxaviers> changing..
[09:57:46] <Dragooon> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/edeluh/2/edit
[09:57:52] <Dragooon> I think that's what you meant?
[09:59:29] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, the new approach assumes every category we find on post.termSlugs.category are described in taxonomies.json. But, I guess this is a must anyway, right?
[10:00:47] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:08:41] <rxaviers> except for "uncategorized" :-/
[10:10:19] <rxaviers> nevermind ^
[10:25:46] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, any hint why we have duplicate entries below?
[10:25:55] <rxaviers> dist/wordpress/posts/post/jQuery.widget.html:

[10:26:43] <uGoMobi> Dragooon: yes, thanks!
[10:30:25] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Because those files contain multiple entries.
[10:30:49] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'll look into what's going on after I finish this PR review. We definitley shouldn't be duplicating the categories.
[10:30:58] <rxaviers> ok
[10:31:04] <rxaviers> PR's updated
[10:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.

[11:45:02] <uGoMobi> frequent: hey :)
[11:45:29] <uGoMobi> frequent: saw your ticket about role atributes
[11:45:36] <frequent> yup
[11:45:45] <frequent> need a test page?
[11:45:58] <uGoMobi> frequent: do you copy the generated markup in a file and have that validated or something?
[11:46:11] <arschmitz> frequent: i guess uGoMobigot your question answered ill review your updateds
[11:46:14] <arschmitz> updates
[11:46:28] <uGoMobi> I mean, I don't understand how you can get errors for that
[11:46:52] <frequent> arschmitz: ok. thx. I'm doing tests now, so give me a few hours, because I have not checked if new options are working or not (destroy etc)
[11:47:15] <frequent> uGoMobi: I did a page with a popup and copy/pasted the enhanced page into the W3C validator
[11:48:19] <uGoMobi> and what error do you get?
[11:49:15] <frequent> 1sec
[11:49:39] <frequent> aria-owns="#my_popup" vs aria-owns="#my_popup-popup"
[11:49:53] <uGoMobi> right, but what does the error say?
[11:49:57] <frequent> so validator complains that aria-owns must refer to an element that exists in the page
[11:50:36] <frequent> when you create the popup, you postfix the id of the popup with "-popup"? (don't have the code here)
[11:50:55] <uGoMobi> yup, we add that
[11:51:07] <frequent> and the aria-owns still has the un-fixed id
[11:51:10] <uGoMobi> but that's the container
[11:51:14] <frequent> hm
[11:51:26] <uGoMobi> and in the container is the popup itself with #my_popup
[11:51:41] <frequent> ok. so there is an element...
[11:51:46] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:51:48] <frequent> let me check again tomorrow
[11:52:15] <frequent> 2nd error was the button was missing the role attribute
[11:52:32] <frequent> role="button"
[11:52:47] <frequent> but I will also recheck tomorrow
[11:52:50] <uGoMobi> what is "the button"
[11:53:24] <uGoMobi> we do want to add that role (there is a ticket for that) but that doesn't make markup without it invalid
[11:54:06] <uGoMobi> the button is the anchor element that links to the popup?
[11:54:10] <frequent> "the button" = the button to open the popup = <a href="...
[11:54:15] <frequent> yup

[11:58:22] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:58:30] <frequent> I'm still lost :-D
[11:58:39] <uGoMobi> okay, no problem
[11:58:44] <frequent> looking at the table widget, you declare o.classes
[11:58:51] <arschmitz> frequent: the data-id should be the id of the wrapper you create
[11:59:01] <frequent> ok
[11:59:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: should we centralize this code?
[11:59:25] <arschmitz> frequent: data-classes is a string that should be added to the classes of the wrapper you create
[11:59:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont think so it only effects widgets with wrappers and they may chose to construct their wrapper in different ways
[12:00:14] <frequent> ok. so I generate a o.classes string, which gets added to the wrapper once done.
[12:00:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh okay
[12:00:32] <arschmitz> frequent: it should be added to the wrapper when you create it
[12:00:33] <uGoMobi> thought it was more or less the same with input button,checkbox, select
[12:00:47] <uGoMobi> and widget() should return their wrapper
[12:00:48] <frequent> yup. at the end of _create I mean
[12:01:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes but that add's another call that causes dom manip
[12:01:22] <uGoMobi> true
[12:01:27] <arschmitz> if you added them to the wrapper when you create it before appending it its better 
[12:01:31] <uGoMobi> best is while creating the wraper
[12:01:34] <uGoMobi> wrapper*
[12:01:37] <arschmitz> exactly
[12:01:40] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:01:47] <frequent> allright.
[12:01:53] <frequent> and since it's Q&A time
[12:02:10] <frequent> what should happen in refresh?
[12:02:12] <uGoMobi> ...we can ask you question?
[12:02:17] <arschmitz> frequent: i would not look at tables widget for example of classes thats different htere
[12:02:18] <frequent> of course...
[12:02:20] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:02:43] <uGoMobi> I don't think we should do anything with this on refresh
[12:02:48] <arschmitz> frequent: many widgets nothing
[12:02:49] <frequent> good
[12:02:59] <frequent> ok. then refresh is done.
[12:03:00] <arschmitz> yours probably nothing thinking about it real quick
[12:03:01] <frequent> (removed)
[12:03:02] <uGoMobi> if you want add a class or id you add it directly to the wrapper
[12:03:33] <arschmitz> frequent: for the most part setoptions will handle most things that would typicly be refresh
[12:03:39] <uGoMobi> doesn't make sense to change the data and then call refresh to have it added to the wrapper that is already created
[12:03:43] <frequent> ic
[12:03:59] <arschmitz> but like select or list view need it because they need to reparse the dom
[12:04:10] <arschmitz> to update
[12:04:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you talking about data-id and data-class now?
[12:04:42] <arschmitz> no refresh
[12:05:01] <uGoMobi> ah ok in general
[12:05:08] <frequent> yup
[12:05:10] <arschmitz> right
[12:05:29] <arschmitz> filter does not need it because any refresh type stuff would just be done by setting options
[12:05:32] <uGoMobi> I thought frequent was asking if something should be done with those two on refresh
[12:05:45] <frequent> uGoMobi: nope. just in general.
[12:05:51] <uGoMobi> okay, sorry
[12:05:54] <frequent> np
[12:06:11] <frequent> change of widget?
[12:06:26] <frequent> I have been playing around with a carousel widget...
[12:06:54] <uGoMobi> like switching from one widget to another?
[12:07:07] <frequent> no... like you plan for 1.5 and I need a quick mockup
[12:07:12] <frequent> slider
[12:07:20] <uGoMobi> ahhh
[12:07:27] * uGoMobi is really slow tonight
[12:07:33] <frequent> it's late :-)
[12:07:36] <frequent> here
[12:07:44] <uGoMobi> still jetlag
[12:07:45] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:08:02] <uGoMobi> we do want to add a carousel with swipe in the near future
[12:08:20] <frequent> ok. will that use the transitions available?
[12:08:28] <frequent> this is what I'm fighting with
[12:08:44] <uGoMobi> hmm
[12:08:50] <frequent> would be nice to make them re-useable on any type of pos:abs elements
[12:08:51] <uGoMobi> let's start with just slide
[12:09:02] <arschmitz> frequent: i dont think there has been even the most basic of planning for that yet just writing down that we want to make one :)
[12:09:30] <frequent> ok. I spent a day inBeforeOutStartDoneOutBeforeIn... and was all confused
[12:09:39] <uGoMobi> haha
[12:10:40] <frequent> sure is hard to follow along. I had tried to do the same with queue()
[12:10:56] <frequent> but not happy yet.
[12:11:16] <frequent> when I have a working prototype, I will put it up ... for inspiration...
[12:11:21] <uGoMobi> cool
[12:11:46] <frequent> I was also looking at the code of http://www.photoswipe.com/
[12:12:31] <frequent> pitty it's not being maintained. Would a gallery widget be something for 1.x?
[12:13:03] <frequent> variation of dialog+swipe-events+?
[12:13:32] <uGoMobi> hmm not sure if gallery is something for a widget
[12:13:58] <uGoMobi> we already have a demo how you can make a responsive grid listview
[12:14:22] <frequent> true
[12:15:33] <uGoMobi> but just a carousel that can be used for any content and works with swip is nice
[12:15:56] <uGoMobi> I like the snap back effect in that photoswipe plugin
[12:16:01] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15vernonk opened issue #6121: Column-Toggle Table breaks when linkBindingEnabled set to false  02http://git.io/-qcIhQ
[12:16:10] <frequent> yeah.
[12:16:38] <frequent> it has some nice features, but it's superhard to customize and don't think about multiple instances on page... 
[12:16:39] <uGoMobi> not sure if I already tested it on mobile devices
[12:17:02] <frequent> it does have 1300 stars on Github
[12:17:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: frequent: iv used it in the past
[12:17:23] <frequent> Arschmitz: I'm still using it
[12:17:34] <arschmitz> its got some nice stuff but i ditched it too buggy 
[12:17:42] <frequent> agree
[12:18:12] <frequent> I have looked through the code a little... that's why I thought maybe it would make a nice widget
[12:18:30] <frequent> because a lot of things (events, overlay, toolbars, listview) are there already
[12:18:56] <arschmitz> i think its a great plugin but not something to include in library
[12:25:07] <frequent> arschmitz: ok. just thinking.

[13:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I don't see what's being mapped here: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/152/files#L1R6
[13:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> If you're returning the input, it's not a map.
[13:13:58] <rxaviers> rxaviers, taxonomies.category is an Array with each category
[13:14:15] <rxaviers> I am augmenting each with posts and returning it
[13:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> That's not a map.
[13:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> That's just modifying the elements in place.
[13:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> You should drop the taxonomies var.
[13:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> Assign .category to the categories var.
[13:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> Then .forEach() over the categories and add the posts array in the loop.
[13:15:28] <rxaviers> mm right
[13:15:36] <rxaviers> indeed
[13:19:26] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, "No need for a return at the end of the function."
[13:19:55] <rxaviers> this is just to emphasize. It's hard to get bugs like that if on future modifications someone adds code after the callback
[13:20:01] <rxaviers> Do you want me to remove anyway?
[13:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yes.
[13:20:17] <scott_gonzalez> We have tons of async code and never do that anywhere.
[13:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW: This is a consistency thing. I think the idea of always return when invoking a callback is good.
[13:31:30] <rxaviers> PR updated
[13:31:55] <rxaviers> I've fixed some other things I found (each commit per fix for now, will amend later when it's good to go)
[13:37:38] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Why do you need to special case the uncategorized category?
[13:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> Also, are there really posts that explicitly have a category of uncategorized?
[13:40:08] <scott_gonzalez> That seems odd.
[13:40:57] <rxaviers> to be honest, I was checking an issue with it and left it.
[13:41:21] <rxaviers> I have to have so many fixes in such a small patch. Arg
[13:41:24] <rxaviers> hate*
[13:41:41] <rxaviers> sorry about it
[13:44:51] <rxaviers> fixed
[13:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, now can you move it into grunt.js?
[13:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> That eliminates the code from the complete callback, which brings the tasks file down to 15 LOC.
[13:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> No need for a file to just move out one function.
[13:49:52] <rxaviers> sure
[13:53:43] <rxaviers> moved
[13:58:30] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, is it the "({" vs. "( {" thing?
[13:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Actually, why are you adding the wrapper object to the file?
[13:59:38] <scott_gonzalez> Why isn't the file just the categories variable without a wrapper?
[14:00:28] <rxaviers> only the array?

[14:00:51] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[14:01:08] <rxaviers> Is only the array a proper JSON file? I think the parser complained once to me. Let me double check
[14:04:32] <rxaviers> the array also parses just fine with no complain. Removing the wrapper
[14:06:29] <rxaviers> pushed
[14:07:16] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, "Also, this line needs to be split onto multiple lines"
[14:07:20] <rxaviers> how do you want it to be split?
[14:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> Good to know brand new code is being written on top of jQuery UI 1.8.x, and not even following standard conventions: http://minimul.com/jqueryui-widget-to-either-autocomplete-or-browse-through-a-large-data-set.html?utm_content=bufferfbd5a&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer
[14:07:42] <rxaviers> do you want me to assign variables to the parts. Then use the variables instead? Or line break things?
[14:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> Line break is fine.
[14:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> Probably right after the filename.

[14:13:59] <rxaviers> pushed
[14:14:46] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good to land.
[14:15:00] <scott_gonzalez> wait
[14:15:19] <scott_gonzalez> Move the new task above all the alias tasks.
[14:15:52] <rxaviers> ok
[14:16:11] <rxaviers> btw, in all my personal codes, I never go beyond 80 columns.. But, on jQuery, I always see big lines. So, I thought the rule was never line break things.. :P
[14:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> The rule is a hard stop at 100.
[14:17:38] <rxaviers> interesting
[14:20:07] <rxaviers> all amended
[14:20:28] <rxaviers> last review?
[14:20:29] <rxaviers> hehe
[14:20:44] <rxaviers> scott, should we land it in all 1-x branches?
[14:20:49] <rxaviers> I mean can?
[14:21:07] <rxaviers> because, DB actually needs that in the 1-x branches
[14:21:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yup
