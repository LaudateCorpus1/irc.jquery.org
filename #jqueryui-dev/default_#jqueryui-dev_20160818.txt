[11:22:54] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: I don't see a final UI 1.12.0 blog post, is that intentional? The latest one is about the RC2
[11:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we had issues during the 1.12.0 release.
[11:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> So we're holding off until 1.12.1
[11:35:43] <scott_gonzalez> But with the site deployment issues, that's not so easy.
[14:59:30] <Ali_> New to jQuery UI and open source. Just forked and cloned the repo. When I work on a bug in jQuery UI, how do I build the change locally and test locally?
