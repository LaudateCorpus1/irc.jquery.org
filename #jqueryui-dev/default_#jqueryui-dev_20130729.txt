[00:05:40] <uGoMobi> morning
[00:19:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[00:20:06] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ good morning
[00:20:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can I deprecate option "arrow" of the popup arrow now that alpha is out?
[00:20:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I want to deprecate it because it also has option "arrowSides" which determine which sides the arrow can go on.
[00:21:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, if arrowSides="" then you don't want an arrow, obviously, so arrow=false is superfluous.
[00:21:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: makes sense :)
[00:21:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think you have to deprecate
[00:21:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In fact, I'd like to get rid of the option altogether, and it hasn't been documented yet.
[00:21:29] <uGoMobi> you can just remove
[00:21:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yessir! Happy to do that.
[00:21:49] <uGoMobi> it's a new feature
[00:22:09] <uGoMobi> as far as I know we can make any change that we see fit while on alpha
[00:23:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, as far as arrow size configurability is concerned, I'll try to re-write the whole CSS in terms of percentages, and so it will all depend on the width/height of the arrow box.
[00:23:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That will make it configurable.
[00:23:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... because currently there is no way to set the arrow size at runtime, because it's all specified in pixels in classes in the structure.
[00:23:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that sounds awesome
[00:23:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So you'd have to replace the classes.
[00:23:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... it will be, if it works.
[00:23:54] <uGoMobi> :)
[00:24:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you agree with reason why it shouldn't be in theme.css?
[00:24:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: widget specific CSS
[00:25:05] <uGoMobi> I am even not happy with widget specific selectors in theme css, but have to look into that for 1.5
[00:25:19] <uGoMobi> it's mostly for slider which is gonna change
[00:25:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK ... I guess ... the thing is though, how else are you gonna configure it easily, if it turns out that I can't do it using percentages.
[00:25:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It also depends on your definition of "theme". If theme is restricted to colours, then OK, it makes sense.
[00:26:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: overrides
[00:26:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well, theme also contains border-radius
[00:26:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I guess people can just copy css/structure/jquery.mobile.popup.arrow.css and edit it and re-append it after the jQM CSS.
[00:27:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[00:27:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess we'll have to document that.
[00:28:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: would be good to have a demo yes
[00:28:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If I were to write a demo that does it for them, then I'd essentially be writing a second TR for the popup arrow.
[00:28:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Because I could very well have a button that says "View CSS" (which is not the same as View Source) and then they can copy/paste.
[00:29:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes true
[00:29:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In fact, if I did that, I wouldn't really need to worry about percentages.
[00:29:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I could just inject a style tag with a copy of jquery.mobile.popup.arrow.css ...
[00:30:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and display the contents of the style tag when the user clicks the button.
[00:32:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think that's an easier solution that making percentages work
[00:33:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can add a slider to override the px values with inline style and then .css() in the view CSS code
[00:38:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: something else... should we prevent buttonMarkup() changing classes on anything else than anhors and button elements?
[00:38:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you call buttonMarkup() for an input type="button" it adds/removes classes to/from the native input
[00:39:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... then you should call  $( ".myButton" ).button( "widget" ).buttonMarkup( { /* new options */ } );
[00:39:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That'll access the wrapper.
[00:40:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think buttonMarkup should do that kind of filtering because it'll slow down significantly.
[00:40:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you shouldn't call buttonMarkup() at all, just use _setOptions()
[00:40:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, good reason
[00:41:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's a good point. You shouldn't, because if you do, the widget options and the classes will be out of sync.
[00:41:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly
[00:41:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, I gotta go for the day. I'll be back late in the evening.
[00:41:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can say "late in the evening" with confidence because our time difference is only an hour :)
[00:42:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just wasn't sure if we should do something about it because we had some documentation issues with buttons
[00:42:07] <uGoMobi> lol
[00:42:14] <uGoMobi> ok have a good one
[00:42:17] <uGoMobi> see you later

[04:08:55] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[04:09:16] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[04:09:36] <frequent> uGoMobi: looks filter has some issues...
[04:09:40] <frequent> :-(
[04:10:11] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah I saw those tickets opened by RWhitbeck 
[04:10:52] <frequent> I did the demo page before the final review, so it contains some things, which are no longer in the widget (I assume)
[04:11:06] <uGoMobi> frequent: I was thinking the same
[04:11:07] <frequent> need to look at the current code tonight
[04:11:30] <uGoMobi> frequent: it has to do with the code for backwards compatibility
[04:11:42] <frequent> uGoMobi: dunno
[04:12:00] <uGoMobi> ok I am not sure either, but that's what I think
[04:12:12] <uGoMobi> because in 1.5 you will just have to create the input yourself
[04:12:24] <frequent> ... thats forward compat...
[04:12:49] <uGoMobi> and _|Nix|_ added some code that in current version style options set for the listview would still work
[04:13:03] <frequent> I see. 
[04:13:08] <uGoMobi> yeah, depends on how you look at it
[04:13:13] <frequent> I can have a look tonight
[04:13:27] <uGoMobi> we didn't deprecate old listview filter until 1.4
[04:13:30] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok great
[04:13:39] <frequent> and we can talk on IRC on what I find
[04:13:40] <uGoMobi> frequent: _|Nix|_ said he will be back tonight too
[04:13:52] <frequent> with _|Nix|_
[04:13:57] <frequent> ok. perfect.
[04:13:59] <uGoMobi> frequent: might be good idea to discuss it with him
[04:14:03] <frequent> yup
[04:14:04] <uGoMobi> sounds like a plan :)
[04:14:13] <frequent> ok. so see you later ;-)
[04:14:17] <uGoMobi> later
[05:55:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: morning
[05:55:33] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:55:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how was your weekend?
[05:56:01] <arschmitz> good yours
[05:56:11] <uGoMobi> congrats with your wife's birthday
[05:56:29] <arschmitz> big 30 lol
[05:56:39] <uGoMobi> was good too... just chilled
[05:56:47] <uGoMobi> ah nice
[05:58:49] <arschmitz> We went to a big casino in Connecticut 
[05:59:06] <uGoMobi> ah ok cool
[05:59:14] <uGoMobi> rich or broke now? ;-)
[05:59:35] <arschmitz> neither lol 
[05:59:43] <uGoMobi> good :)
[06:01:53] <arschmitz> ralph is blowin up the filter lol
[06:02:08] <uGoMobi> yeah :/
[06:02:09] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:02:30] <uGoMobi> not sure what's going on there
[06:02:31] <arschmitz> oh well thats why its an alpha
[06:02:44] <uGoMobi> but frequent will look into it
[06:02:46] <uGoMobi> with _|Nix|_ 
[06:02:54] <arschmitz> yeah im not too worried
[06:03:02] <arschmitz> im sure they will take care of it
[06:03:37] <arschmitz> i think im going to essentially start over on autoinit with all the branches its too much of a pain rebasing all the conflicts
[06:03:44] <uGoMobi> there also seems to be problem with SVG on Androidn 2.x
[06:03:59] <arschmitz> yeah saw that im going to charge up all the phones today
[06:04:08] <arschmitz> and test them
[06:04:22] <uGoMobi> i need to charge my 2.3 device too
[06:04:35] <arschmitz> i have like 3 or 4 2.3 devices and a 2.2
[06:05:33] <uGoMobi> i will ask Filament guys if Grunticon just works on Android 2.x
[06:05:39] <arschmitz> i know filaments real 2.2 device blew up ( not joking ) so they probably only tested it in emulator
[06:05:54] <arschmitz> and i think they only have one 2.3 
[06:05:58] <uGoMobi> I removed that hasFeature() from the SVG test because that was for FF 3.6
[06:06:07] <arschmitz> yeah we had talked about that
[06:06:57] <arschmitz> testiing on half a dozen 2.x devices on different versions should give us a good idea whats up
[06:07:00] <uGoMobi> don't think that can be the cause
[06:07:10] <arschmitz> no it should not be an issue
[06:07:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I removed the links to the test pages on the demo center homepage
[06:07:40] <uGoMobi> that was only temporary
[06:07:50] <uGoMobi> but there is still a grunticon test page
[06:08:23] <uGoMobi> that uses the grunticon loader script
[06:08:29] <uGoMobi> without changes
[06:08:33] <arschmitz> ok
[06:19:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: grunticon is the perfect chance to relly try out adobe edge connect
[06:20:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nice
[06:22:28] <arschmitz> i might need to make a video of it lol
[07:16:57] <RWhitbeck> Morning…sorry about the tickets last night.  Was writting a blog post on Filter and found a bunch of stuff while going through the demos
[07:19:43] <arschmitz> hey RWhitbeck 
[07:20:12] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: never apologize for filing bugs lol thats how we know its broke and broke it seems to be
[07:20:30] <RWhitbeck> Oh I am not really sorry ;)
[07:20:34] <RWhitbeck> lol
[07:20:43] <arschmitz> some how i didnt think so
[07:25:27] <RWhitbeck> Hey arschmitz question for you.  At the conference for the keynote you said that content container was going to make it into 1.4.  Did it get yanked at the last minute?
[07:25:39] <RWhitbeck> I am not seeing it in the release notes. 
[07:25:44] <arschmitz> no we are just not publicly documenting it
[07:25:46] <arschmitz> yet
[07:25:54] <RWhitbeck> ok
[07:25:58] <RWhitbeck> so it's in there?
[07:26:02] <arschmitz> yes
[07:26:07] <RWhitbeck> ah
[07:26:24] <arschmitz> but we might make some api changes still so not publicly documenting it yet
[07:26:31] <RWhitbeck> I take it another alpha might reveal it? 
[07:26:48] <arschmitz> no i think it wont be publicly documented until 1.5 now
[07:27:07] <arschmitz> until we decide its final form
[07:27:24] <RWhitbeck> ok
[07:42:17] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15MvHMontySCOUT opened issue #6232: data-clear-btn for <input type="search"> doesn't work.  02http://git.io/oW9pww
[07:44:01] <toddmparker> morning all
[07:44:14] <toddmparker> contrast on the alpha! looks great.
[07:44:29] <toddmparker> heh, congrats too
[07:47:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker: hey
[07:50:27] <toddmparker> how goes arschmitz 
[07:50:32] <toddmparker> good weekend?
[07:50:39] <arschmitz> yeah went to foxwoods
[07:50:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker: for my wifes 30th birthday
[07:51:14] <toddmparker> nice! are you rich now?
[07:51:21] <arschmitz> nope
[07:51:35] <toddmparker> I am bad at gambling
[07:52:26] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[07:52:27] <arschmitz> yeah i dont really gamble
[07:52:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker: maybe some penny slots
[07:52:51] <toddmparker> yeah. i'll do video poker, that's it. quarter at a time
[07:52:53] <toddmparker> hi uGoMobi 
[07:52:57] <toddmparker> how was your weekend?
[07:53:10] <uGoMobi> it was good... very lazy :)
[07:53:24] <toddmparker> sure you all needed a break after alpha went out
[07:53:33] <toddmparker> tracker seems pretty quiet…good news
[07:55:42] <arschmitz> yup just a couple things to look at so far
[07:56:29] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: have to see why icons don't work on Android 2.x
[07:56:52] <toddmparker> hmm
[07:57:12] <toddmparker> 2.3 should be getting the fallback png i belive
[07:58:36] <RWhitbeck> Morning toddmparker
[07:59:04] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I just checked default browser on 2.3.4 and see icons
[07:59:17] <toddmparker> hi RWhitbeck 
[07:59:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i have half a dozen 2.3 phones and a 2.2 phone im charging up to check right now
[07:59:48] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok thanks, have to check on what version frequent saw the problem
[07:59:54] <uGoMobi> hey RWhitbeck 
[08:00:11] <RWhitbeck> good afternoon uGoMobi
[08:00:19] <toddmparker> ok, i can test if he has more info
[08:00:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker: all different versions so should give a good idea of what versions are having issue
[08:00:29] <toddmparker> tho our 2.1 and 2.2 phones are dead :)
[08:00:35] <toddmparker> browserstack will help there
[08:01:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: i burried under test devices so he can test :)
[08:01:10] <uGoMobi> s/i/is/
[08:01:30] <arschmitz> yeah i have like every popular device known to man at the moment lol
[08:01:34] <toddmparker> nice
[08:01:54] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: new website is making good progress too, great!
[08:02:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker: set up adobe edge connect on them too so i can control them all from chrome 
[08:02:22] <toddmparker> we had to force downgrade opera mini a while back because it tried using the svg and was buggy. actually got worse on newer versions
[08:02:23] <RWhitbeck> yeah the big hurdle is getting the style changes into master…I have a pull request in but I am not sure I did it right. 
[08:02:35] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah, that helps a lot
[08:23:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: fyi, after hours and hours of work without a commit to show for it i finally have polymer firing pointer events in IE8 … completely broken, targetless, unusable events, but events none the less :)
[09:31:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[09:37:35] <gseguin> hey all
[09:37:44] <agcolom> hey gseguin :-)
[09:38:02] <gseguin> how was your weekend agcolom?
[09:38:17] <agcolom> relaxing for a change :-)

[11:53:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sure
[11:54:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks!
[11:54:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also as far as alpha uGoMobi and i briefly talked about doing an alpha2
[11:54:27] <arschmitz> in which case we can change anything we want basicly
[11:54:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, OK, if it's agreed.
[11:55:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: whats your thought on it? mine was even though technically the autoinit change is ok id prefer to do another alpha since its such a big change
[11:55:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... we still shouldn't fo anything major though.
[11:56:07] <uGoMobi> let's see what issues popup the next few days and then decide if we need to do another alpha
[11:56:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[11:56:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... we can still do beta after you merge autoinit.
[11:57:06] <arschmitz> of course
[11:57:07] <uGoMobi> we will do beta
[11:57:15] <arschmitz> there will be a beta either way
[11:57:29] <uGoMobi> and can do beta 2 if autoinit caused an issue
[11:57:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think that's plenty of time to shake down autoinit.
[11:57:33] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[11:57:34] <arschmitz> true
[11:59:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just found an icon issue
[11:59:25] <frequent> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: hey
[11:59:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok

[12:21:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its not timing its because they get moved to the body
[12:22:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok
[12:22:26] <uGoMobi> we discussed inherit theme from overlay
[12:22:31] <arschmitz> yea
[12:23:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry, I forgot about that too
[12:23:23] <arschmitz> so did i until someone just filed an issue
[12:23:26] <uGoMobi> I wanted to look into that for external panels
[12:23:38] <uGoMobi> but didn't have enough time
[12:24:09] <uGoMobi> so I thought, we document that you have to set a theme for widgets outside a page
[12:24:28] <uGoMobi> forgot that it was also an issue with the persistent toolbar

[12:28:37] <_|Nix|_> Just out of curiosity ... can you set a theme on the body?
[12:29:00] <_|Nix|_> That would be, like, the theme for the application ...
[12:29:13] <_|Nix|_> It stands to reason that the whole app might have the same theme.
[12:29:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah uGoMobi and i discussed that at one point
[12:29:42] <arschmitz> i think he said it would not work because of overrides
[12:30:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right ... he's used html body as a specificity inflation device.
[12:30:21] <uGoMobi> right
[12:30:29] <uGoMobi> I was running out of selectors
[12:30:35] <_|Nix|_> That's SID for short.
[12:30:48] <uGoMobi> or better... elements to use in selectors
[12:31:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you ever try head + ?
[12:31:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not yet
[12:32:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just gotta make suer using head + will not also make it impossible to specify the default theme in the body.
[12:32:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I probably will now because if things inherit from ui-overlay-* on the body I need that
[12:32:53] <uGoMobi> what do you mean _|Nix|_ ?
[12:33:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, head + === body, right?
[12:33:41] <agcolom> Hi, I have a question that seems stupid... but I can't work out...
[12:33:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if head + specifies things, then it will override anything specified in body because that thing definitely has lower specificity.
[12:33:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the selector will probably be head + body
[12:34:22] <uGoMobi> head is not used to target anything but just to increase the specificity
[12:34:31] <agcolom> what is the best way to find out the size of a file?
[12:34:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi and go ahead
[12:34:43] <agcolom> I'm updating http://stage.jquerymobile.com/download/
[12:34:54] <agcolom> and we specify the size of the files...
[12:35:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, I understand, but if you then add class, like, ui-body-b to body, will that have enough specificity to apply the b rules to the stuff inside the body?
[12:35:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am not sure but maybe there is a PHP function for that
[12:35:23] <agcolom> so we're saying for example: jquery.mobile-1.3.0.min.js (24KB, ready to deploy) 
[12:35:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, just ignore me if I'm totally not making sense. I'm an even bigger n00b with CSS than I am with HTML and JS :)
[12:35:56] <agcolom> so I saved the file and looked at its size, and it's miles away from that...
[12:36:11] <agcolom> so I guess I'm doing it wrong?
[12:36:23] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What size does it show?
[12:36:32] <agcolom> 144KB
[12:36:39] <_|Nix|_> D000d!

[12:37:03] <agcolom> Oh maybe if I look on the dev tools and resources?
[12:37:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that won't be a problem because a class has specificity 010 while head + body has 002 (001 for both elements)
[12:38:51] <uGoMobi> hmm filterable can cause phantomjs to time out as well
[12:39:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Great!
[12:39:33] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... yeah ... jquery.mobile-1.4.0-alpha.1.min.js is 179 KiB!
[12:39:45] <_|Nix|_> That's an insane increase from 24K ...
[12:39:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when you use an ID it has specificity 100 so you will need 10 class names and something else to override :)
[12:40:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wow! OK ...
[12:40:12] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:40:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I didn't know it was quantified this tightly. Cool!
[12:40:25] <arschmitz> agcolom: thats gziped
[12:40:25] <uGoMobi> 179Kb minified?? o_O
[12:40:33] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[12:40:57] <agcolom> ok! I was getting very confused!
[12:41:04] <_|Nix|_> wget wget http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.0-alpha.1/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-alpha.1.min.js; ls -lh jquery.mobile-1.4.0-alpha.1.min.js;
[12:41:17] <_|Nix|_> s/^wget //
[12:42:12] <_|Nix|_> OK, with gzip -v9 it's 50KiB ...
[12:42:22] <agcolom> right, next question, what are those values for 1.3.2?
[12:42:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Checking ...
[12:42:42] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: thanks :-)
[12:42:48] <arschmitz> agcolom: heres how you can tell easy
[12:43:02] <arschmitz> go to http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.0-alpha.1/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-alpha.1.min.js or what ever file in chrome
[12:43:17] <agcolom> yes
[12:43:24] <arschmitz> then goto developer tools and network
[12:43:28] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: 50K
[12:43:33] <arschmitz> then right click and clear browser cache 
[12:43:39] <arschmitz> and refresh
[12:43:40] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's 50KiB ... I hope that's what the K refers to.
[12:43:55] <arschmitz> at the bottom it will show the amount transfered
[12:43:56] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I mean refers to on the Web site.
[12:44:39] <agcolom> arschmitz: Magic! Thanks!
[12:44:53] <arschmitz> no prob
[12:45:57] <arschmitz> agcolom: also the 27 for 1.2 is a little optimistic i see 33.3 when i check it 
[12:46:26] <agcolom> yes, I see 40.9 for 1.3.0
[12:47:08] <agcolom> right so should I change these also?
[12:47:14] <agcolom> I guess I should?
[12:47:31] <arschmitz> yeah i mean i dont think 1.2 matters too much good to update 1.3 though
[12:50:27] <agcolom> arschmitz: but we say minifiled and gzipped, so I guess gzipping would reduce it a bit further?
[12:50:53] <arschmitz> agcolom: when you look in your browser like that it is gzipped

[12:51:09] <agcolom> oh! ok, thanks!
[12:53:00] <_|Nix|_> I wonder why browsers don't support bzip2 or lzma ... those compress even better.
[12:53:13] <_|Nix|_> Maybe the CPU usage is prohibitive on the server.
[12:55:34] <gseguin> 179KB ?? what did we add in there?
[12:57:34] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That's non-gzipped.

[12:58:11] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Well, 1.3.2 was 41KiB ...
[12:58:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So we added 9KiB of awesome!

[13:05:23] <paul_irish> ah. we need a http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size for UI

[13:06:51] <gseguin> Did we really add that much code? Or could there be an issue with the build?

[13:17:08] <agcolom> Maybe this page can help: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pulse/monthly
[13:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You should just remove file size anywhere it appears on jquerymobile.com :-)
[13:17:26] <gseguin> I like scott_gonzalez's solution
[13:17:29] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, will do that now, thanks

[13:17:52] <gseguin> that's right then the problem is gone, right?
[13:17:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: it would appear that way
[13:17:53] <scott_gonzalez> There's only one thing that happens when people see file size...
[13:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> "X is so bloated"
[13:18:11] <gseguin> true
[13:18:19] <agcolom> I agree :-)
[13:18:35] <scott_gonzalez> or "Let's use X because it's only 5 bytes gzipped. Who cares that it has no features and breaks in 7 of the 3 browsers that I care about."
[13:18:45] <gseguin> but we should find out if it's legit weight gain or if something is off in the build
[13:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should look into that.
[13:25:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is it OK if the popup arrow uses classes like arrow-container? I guess it should be ui-popup-arrow-container, right?
[13:25:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I should prefix all my classes with ui-popup, right?
[13:25:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, ui prefix
[13:26:11] <uGoMobi> ah you mean popup prefix
[13:26:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno ... I have classes like l t r b for left top right and bottom arrow ... they never appear without a ui-popup-arrow class ...
[13:26:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Should I make those, like, ui-popup-arrow-l, etc?
[13:27:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes that's best
[13:27:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, and I have a class for IE workarounds. It's called (surprise!) "ie".
[13:27:29] <uGoMobi> kinda consistent with how we do that for icons
[13:27:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. So, ui-popup-arrow-*
[13:27:40] <uGoMobi> although it's something totally different ;)
[13:27:46] <uGoMobi> yup
[13:27:51] <_|Nix|_> Yessir!
[13:28:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what about the IE workaround?
[13:28:20] <uGoMobi> what will be the full class name
[13:28:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ui-popup-arrow-ie *shrug*
[13:28:48] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[13:28:52] <scott_gonzalez> You can't have a class name *-ie
[13:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> Why isn't the workaround just in CSS?
[13:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> And how are you detecting that you need to add that class?
[13:29:52] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ieHack = ( $.mobile.browser.oldIE && $.mobile.browser.oldIE <= 8 ),
[13:30:08] <scott_gonzalez> You can't write that code in a jQuery project.
[13:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> $.mobile.browser needs to be deprecated immediately and no new code can use it.
[13:30:48] <uGoMobi> I believe we have a class name with android in it for a workaround
[13:30:52] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK, but oldIE has these quirky problems when you apply transformations ... how am I supposed to make it work correctly?
[13:30:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ^^
[13:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[13:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> old IE supports transforms?!?
[13:31:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its possible im not sure
[13:31:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: http://www.useragentman.com/IETransformsTranslator/
[13:32:01] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yes, but it's quirky.
[13:32:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: mobile has a ton of ugly browsersniffing for detecting support in places its not nice at all
[13:32:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: something with listview, I dont remember either
[13:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> So don't use the transforms?
[13:33:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, how else am I gonna do an arrow without rotating a box 45° and clipping it at they hypotenuse?
[13:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> Use an icon.
[13:33:54] * scott_gonzalez despises "clever" CSS
[13:35:13] <scott_gonzalez> If you really need the CSS, can't you just use the conditional comments check?
[13:35:46] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats what $.mobile.browser does to check oldie is conditional comments
[13:35:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Probably ... I've seen it before ...
[13:36:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but can I use that in CSS?
[13:36:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I remember there was a way of making something invalid, but understood by IE ... or was it the opposite?
[13:37:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if your thinking of something like *prop:value that wont pass validation cant use it
[13:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> That's not true. We don't need valid CSS.
[13:38:17] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: oh ok i was told we did
[13:38:54] <_|Nix|_> I just read that conditional comments are HTML only :(
[13:38:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: to exclude ie8 and lower you can use :root before your selector 
[13:39:29] <scott_gonzalez> Valid CSS would mean that you can't apply opacity in oldIE.
[13:40:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I think I want the opposite. I want some CSS to only work in IE.
[13:40:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I want margin-left to be 0, except in oldIE.
[13:40:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... where it must be 3 :/
[13:40:44] <_|Nix|_> 3px, that is.
[13:41:20] <_|Nix|_> Anyhoo ... I'll make it work first, and then I'll worry about making it work right.
[13:41:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: selector { margin-left:3px; } :root selector { margin-left:0; }
[13:41:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not saying thats what you should do but it works
[13:41:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... sounds good to me.
[13:42:48] <_|Nix|_> Leave it to the cagy veterans to know a trick like that :)
[13:43:45] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I'm making waaay too many changes all at once ... I have to get this to work first.
[13:53:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh no! I need a situation where IE gets background: none, but nobody else gets that rule.
[13:53:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, in normal browsers I do not wish to say anything about the background, but in IE I wish to set it to none.
[13:54:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: look at http://www.paulirish.com/2009/browser-specific-css-hacks/ lots of browser specific css stuff
[13:55:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: might find something that works for what you need
[13:56:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... I don't get it ... The comment above the example indicates that the selector will be ignored by all browsers except those listed in the comment?
[13:59:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm top seems those are ones that it will exclude bottoms ones ones it will include
[13:59:53] <arschmitz> wait no 
[14:02:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: use http://browserhacks.com/ instead
[14:02:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I did, and I'm still not clear, but it seems that using \0/ at the end of a property will cause everybody but IE8-9 to ignore it.
[14:03:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, there's my answer.
[14:03:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:  yeah iv used that one
[14:03:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Great!
[14:03:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks!
[14:03:30] <_|Nix|_> Did I mention I love IE?
[14:03:34] <arschmitz> Nope
[14:03:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wonder why ...
[14:03:47] <arschmitz> lol
[14:08:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: One rule from arrow CSS should go into theme: The very first one: .ui-popup.ui-corner-all .arrow-guide
[14:08:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is it to set border-radius?
[14:09:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It uses the value of border-radius for something else.
[14:09:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but it needs to be customizable?
[14:09:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It has to be equal to the border radius, and that's customizable.
[14:10:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For example: left: .6em /*{global-radii-blocks}*/;
[14:10:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: gotcha
[14:10:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that should go into theme CSS
[14:10:37] <_|Nix|_> Please!
[14:11:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But OK, I'll move it to the theme CSS myself after I've renamed the classes and stuff.
[14:11:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure
[14:11:24] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[14:20:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have rules like .ui-popu-arrow-container ... now, .ui-popup-arrow-container will only ever appear inside .ui-popup, unless we start putting arrows everywhere. Is it worth making the rule more specific to only target .ui-popup > .ui-popup-arrow-container?
[14:20:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or should I keep it as generic as possible, and make sure the JS doesn't add .ui-popup-arrow-container to a collapsible, or a listview?
[14:21:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess generic is good if people wanna put arrows on other things.
[14:22:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: depends on if ui-popup-arrow-container should override another rule that is set for that element
[14:22:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think so. There are no rules for those elements.
[14:22:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then no need
[14:22:58] <uGoMobi> just use that class name as selector
[14:23:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Good. So, as generic as possible until things break, and then we start getting specific.
[14:23:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, I guess you can't get more generic that .class-name ...
[14:23:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  in genera yes, keeps it easy for people to override
[14:23:55] <uGoMobi> without using 10 classes
[14:24:06] <uGoMobi> s/genera/general/
[14:24:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[14:24:15] <frequent> _|Nix|_: bonne nuit
[14:24:25] <uGoMobi> more specific than class name is multiple class names
[14:24:26] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Hyv

[14:25:48] <frequent> _|Nix|_: :-)
[14:26:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The most I have for arrow is .ui-popup-arrow-container.ui-popup-arrow-r
[14:26:07] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, just want to let you know.. I found out how to fix that issue with requirejs.define..
[14:26:22] <rxaviers> (kinda workaround for now)
[14:26:26] <frequent> _|Nix|_:so I had a look at the filter issues. Have a minute
[14:26:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: And I need that to move the arrow around from top to left to right to bottm.
[14:26:34] <frequent> ... do you have a minute... 
[14:26:35] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Do tell.
[14:26:52] <rxaviers> (so, no need to look into it)
[14:27:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  ok
[14:27:08] <frequent> _|Nix|_: data-mini textinput - add or leave away? (#6230)
[14:28:00] <frequent> _|Nix|_: adding would mean another option, which would be set in the textinput() call along with the theme
[14:28:58] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Nah, it's worse than that. It would mean synchronizing another option with the textinput, just as we synchronize disabled.
[14:29:03] <_|Nix|_> frequent: We have to deprecate that.
[14:29:10] <frequent> ok. so no mini
[14:29:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can we please deprecate the data-mini option for filter?
[14:29:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean filterable.
[14:29:46] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Did the original listview extension have any other options, like corners, theme, shadow, etc?
[14:30:10] <frequent> _|Nix|_: (looks for his archive...)
[14:30:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it should have that option
[14:30:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because we don't support mini for listview
[14:30:39] <uGoMobi> I know someone asked for it in a ticket
[14:30:55] <uGoMobi> because we don't need to add it
[14:31:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, like <ul data-role="listview" data-filter="true" data-mini="true">...</ul> would result in the textinput being mini?
[14:31:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean in 1.3.2.
[14:31:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If so, we need to deprecate that ASAP.
[14:31:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no
[14:32:00] <uGoMobi> there is no mini for listview so also not for the listview filter
[14:32:13] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. thx
[14:32:34] <frequent> I think I just put it in, because I also saw an issue somewhere mentioning it... ok next
[14:32:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so why does RWhitbeck clain in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6320 that you can set data-mini on a data-filter element.
[14:33:07] <frequent> _|Nix|_: because I added it in the demos
[14:33:15] <frequent> and widget
[14:33:21] <RWhitbeck> it's in the demos it must be true ;-)
[14:33:34] <frequent> RWhitbeck: mea culpa... 
[14:33:51] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: Oh, OK, so it's not in the API docs but the demos.
[14:33:57] <RWhitbeck> yeah
[14:34:01] <frequent> should have waited with the demos until final review
[14:34:22] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: Yeah, demos are not ready. Nothing to see there! Move along!
[14:34:27] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: :)
[14:34:58] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: I think we sorta agreed that the API docs are The One And Only Truth™ regarding our API.
[14:35:27] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: If it ain't there and you happen across it, we can leave you without it at a whim.
[14:36:08] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: Contrariwise, we promise to give you at least one minor version's worth of deprecative reprieve.
[14:36:35] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: ... if it /is/ in the API docs.
[14:36:55] <frequent> _|Nix|_: depreciative reprieve... 
[14:37:25] <frequent> :-)

[14:37:41] <_|Nix|_> frequent: English - ya gotta love it!
[14:37:41] <RWhitbeck> how do I see 1.4 api?
[14:37:49] <RWhitbeck> clone and switch branch?
[14:38:00] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: I think so, and then upload to wordpress.
[14:38:16] <RWhitbeck> right with grunt
[14:38:45] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Do we have a live preview of the 1.4 branch of api.jquerymobile.com somewhere?
[14:38:55] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: not that I know of
[14:39:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK, then local build it is. Thanks!
[14:39:34] <frequent> _|Nix|_: next? data-wrapper-class = now gone (#6229). Was used for random filterable elements (your-filter-anything) && to have some way to access user-enhanced markup
[14:40:06] <agcolom> but I think there is an issue with the resources folder, so I think we can only have one version for now... 
[14:40:08] <RWhitbeck> Can we remove these items from the demos before closing so they don't get lost?  Like #6230
[14:40:28] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah, that's gone, because it was getting forwarded to the textinput as well, I think.
[14:41:00] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Or wait, you mean for <input type='button'></input> children?
[14:41:00] <frequent> RWhitbeck: I'm taking notes and will clean up once we are done. 
[14:41:07] <RWhitbeck> ok thanks
[14:41:26] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: Yeah, good point. I'll re-open and add "Demos"
[14:41:54] <frequent> _|Nix|_: the wrapper class was defined on <div data-filter="true" data-wrapper-class="foo"...> which put class of foo on the div wrapping the input
[14:42:06] <frequent> (believes)
[14:42:18] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof reopened issue #6230: Filter: data-mini does not reduce the size of the filter box  02http://git.io/HhHHEQ
[14:42:21] * _|Nix|_ believes likewhise.
[14:42:40] <frequent> _|Nix|_: bottom line: a) is it easy to select the filter input if you only have the widget?
[14:43:05] <frequent> _|Nix|_: b) if the user supplies the search input pre-enhanced, who do we set bindings on it?
[14:43:10] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I think all these bugs are about fixing the demos to reflect the actual capabilities of the widget.
[14:43:22] <frequent> (smells a shortcut...)
[14:43:37] <_|Nix|_> frequent: The user provides a selector that tells us where the input is.
[14:43:43] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok
[14:43:55] <_|Nix|_> frequent: data-input="#my-selector"
[14:44:04] <frequent> ok. good.
[14:44:06] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... and then we this.document.find( this.options.input );
[14:44:13] <frequent> parfait
[14:44:30] <frequent> can be closed also after updating the demos
[14:44:36] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[14:44:54] <frequent> next. #6228 - theme inconsistency. 
[14:44:57] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I think the important thing to realize here is that those bugs are against the demos, not the lib.
[14:45:25] <frequent> yup
[14:45:48] <frequent> I don't want to touch the widget anymore unless something is broken-broken
[14:46:05] <_|Nix|_> frequent: D'accord.
[14:46:51] <frequent> _|Nix|_: so I can update the demo page tomorrow to reflect the current widget. 
[14:47:29] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah, I think it's important to emphasize that people should write their own inputs.
[14:48:02] <frequent> _|Nix|_:last two issues, I'm still not sure - #6226 should we preventDefault on user hitting "return" (I guess that submits the form you wrapped the input in)
[14:48:58] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Hmmm ... good point ...
[14:49:13] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Well, in backcompat I suppose we could.
[14:50:04] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok. I think the listview filter had a nice handle in 1.3.x
[14:50:14] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... because in the non-deprecated version you're supposed to provide the input yourself, so you're also supposed to take care of the implications of submitting whatever form the input belongs to.
[14:50:46] <frequent> _|Nix|_: so I'm not only providing the markup, but also the handler? ok.
[14:50:48] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... so many things to look at.
[14:51:12] <_|Nix|_> frequent: You're making sure the markup you create does not cause any unwanted side-effects such as the form getting submitted.
[14:51:30] <RWhitbeck> Just a note on that. I think I stated in the issue that hitting "return" on the select example where you supply a input yourself hitting return does not reload the page. that is different then the other examples. 
[14:51:42] <frequent> ok. will do whend oing filterable
[14:51:46] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I mean, whenever you add an <input> to your document, that comes with some responsibilities on your part. This is no different from that.
[14:52:09] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok
[14:52:42] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: I think we need to emphasize that having the framework generate the input for you is deprecated and will go away in 1.5.0.
[14:53:04] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: The idea is that you create whatever input you want and pass it to the filterable via data-input="#my-input"
[14:53:28] <RWhitbeck> Does it make sense to include the Filter widget in this release then if next release we are going to drastically change it?
[14:53:55] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: filterable will then this._on( this.document.find( "#my-input" ), { change: "_reactToChange" } ) and will filter when the value of the input changes.
[14:54:24] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: Yes, because this release is the transition period between the listview filter extension and whatever we're going to have in the next release.
[14:55:03] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: So in this release we need to make sure that the new widget replicates the behaviour of the listview filter extension while also providing the features the final implementation will have.
[14:56:10] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: Part of the listview filter extension legacy is this <input> element generation. We will continue to generate the <input> in 1.4.0, but in 1.5.0 that code will be gone, and the dev has to provide her own input via the data-input option.
[14:56:43] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: Of course providing your own input works in 1.4.0 as well. That way, you have a migration path.
[14:57:30] <RWhitbeck> My suggestion is to have the demo's page show the filter widget the way you want it to be done in 1.5 and only have the listview do it both ways till 1.5
[14:57:42] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I have to have a look at the backcompat extension, because it's supposed to copy over any and all options understood by textinput, including theme, corners, mini, and inset.
[14:57:57] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: Oh, definitely. That's the plan.
[14:58:10] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok. thx. I will try to take care of the demo
[14:58:15] <RWhitbeck> _|Nix|_ ok that makes sense then. 
[14:58:23] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Awesome! Thanks!
[14:58:53] <frequent> _|Nix|_: will be sometime tomorrow... my girl is still up... waiting
[14:59:10] <_|Nix|_> frequent: You can add a class to the forms that wrap filter inputs and do a $( ".the-class-you-added" ).on( "submit", function( e ) { e.preventDefault(); } );
[14:59:18] <_|Nix|_> frequent: NP.
[14:59:39] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok. will do tomorrow and PR. then we can discuss a few mins.
[14:59:42] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Have a good one!
[14:59:52] <frequent> _|Nix|_: likewise
[15:09:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ui-body-inherit does not inherit borders ... 
[15:09:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... well, at least not for the popup arrow.
[15:10:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you need to set border-width: 1px; and border-style: solid;
[15:10:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Weird ... it inherits the border for the popup itself, but not the arrow.
[15:10:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I see ... only the colours are inherited?
[15:10:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does the rule setting the border-width and the border-style go into the structure CSS?
[15:11:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I moved border width and style from theme CSS
[15:11:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[15:11:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[15:11:25] <uGoMobi> because it isn't really themeable
[15:11:37] <uGoMobi> if you would change it, it would break things
[15:11:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[15:12:03] <uGoMobi> because we set border-width: 0 sometimes and bring it back with border-width: 1px
[15:12:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aaah, OK.
[15:12:17] <uGoMobi> like we listview styling etc
[15:12:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Seems kinda bad. jQuery Mobile can't handle a border width of ... 2px?
[15:13:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that is indeed something we can improve
[15:13:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. It works now. Thanks!
[15:13:20] <uGoMobi> we could unset by setting border-bottom-style: none
[15:13:52] <uGoMobi> or something like that
[15:14:04] <uGoMobi> and bring back with style: solid
[15:14:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For sure.
[15:14:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I guess not many people use dash-dotted border O_o
[15:17:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually i did on my website
[15:17:36] <uGoMobi> but it's broken on android :/
[15:17:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's a good file to put the theme CSS in?
[15:17:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.css?
[15:18:10] <_|Nix|_> This would go in there:
[15:18:12] <_|Nix|_> .ui-popup.ui-corner-all > .ui-popup-arrow-guide { left: .6em /*{global-radii-blocks}*/; right: .6em /*{global-radii-blocks}*/; top: .6em /*{global-radii-blocks}*/; bottom: .6em /*{global-radii-blocks}*/;
[15:18:16] <_|Nix|_> }
[15:22:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is a theme.css file
[15:22:30] <uGoMobi> jquery.mobile.css is just where structure and theme are combined
[15:23:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so... jquery.mobile.theme.css is where it should land
[15:23:28] <uGoMobi> at the top are the corner styling rules
[15:26:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome! Can do!
[15:33:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wait a second: IE8 doesn't need the clip: rect(5px 6px 7px 8px); notation anymore?
[15:34:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does it understand the comma-separated version?
[15:34:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[15:34:21] <uGoMobi> it was only for IE7
[15:34:27] <uGoMobi> I removed it at other placees
[15:34:30] <uGoMobi> places*
[15:34:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yaaaaay!
[15:35:54] <_|Nix|_> OldIE is my new best friend!

[16:04:54] <_|Nix|_> If it wasn't for IE9 I could get rid of the $.mobile.browser.ie-based hack :(
[16:05:17] <uGoMobi> the \0/ hack?
[16:05:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. No worky in IE9.
[16:05:42] <uGoMobi> what is that?
[16:08:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/afamah/1/edit
[16:08:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In IE8 that will be green instead of red.
[16:11:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for what property is the IE hack?
[16:12:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think you discussed before... I will read back
[16:16:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's for a bunch of arrow-related things.
[16:17:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Need to set margins, but only in IE *roll eyes*
[16:19:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I just read that
[16:21:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: only IE means? IE8 9 and 10?
[16:38:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IE 8 and IE 9/
[16:38:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://blog.vervestudios.co/blog/post/2011/05/13/IE9-Only-CSS-Hack.aspx
[16:39:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That works, but only on color. It does not work on any other CSS property AFAICT.
[16:39:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/ie.html
[16:40:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can work around IE8 just fine, but not IE9 :(
[16:41:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: IE9 is the only one of IE8-10 that understands -ms-transform
[16:41:24] <uGoMobi> you could use a 2D transform instead of margin to shift what you need to shift
[16:43:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, because using a transform is what is causing the problem.
[16:43:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: And I'm using -ms-filter and filter for transforms.
[16:43:48] <uGoMobi> aha
[16:44:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But wait, I may still be able to work around it.
[16:44:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[16:44:55] <uGoMobi> I am calling it a day though
[16:44:58] <uGoMobi> later
[16:45:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: K L8R
[17:19:35] <Mrgoose> Hey anyone around?  I changed the meta settings in my application so that the address bar and footer are moved.  However on an iphone 5 screen the app doesn't take up the full screen there's black bars on the top and bottom.  Any idea how to fix that?
