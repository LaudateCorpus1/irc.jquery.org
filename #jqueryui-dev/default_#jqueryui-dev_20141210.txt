[11:35:01] <reginaldl> hello
[11:36:10] <reginaldl> I'm looking for some help about jquery's Trac instance
[11:38:10] <reginaldl> Trac for JQueryUI seems to be very fast and I was wondering how you managed to get that. Anyone in charge of Trac around?
[12:15:13] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[12:15:36] <mikesherov> so I have a list of followup tasks for effects rewrite, but I'd like to talk about how to land it for now
[12:16:37] <mikesherov> should I just squash everything into 1 big commit with a list of issues it fixes in the message
[12:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Sorry, had to run an errand. Back now. Looking at the list of commits.
[12:34:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that you'd want to squash everything.
[12:34:33] <scott_gonzalez> For example, https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery-ui/commit/dbb6540d60ba232967a1ed867c6f21459f8e09dd should probably be on its own.
[12:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> Certainly most of this can be squashed.
[12:36:23] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: hard to know what specifically to squash and what not to squash
[12:36:26] <scott_gonzalez> Here's a potential list of keepers:
[12:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> e02ec9d0d683c689578efe20d54c05f20c5bb42e
[12:36:40] <scott_gonzalez> dbb6540d60ba232967a1ed867c6f21459f8e09dd
[12:37:47] <scott_gonzalez> d1b41325996a0fd621d4572a12d60e6dfcac841c
[12:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's it.
[12:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> See what happens if you rebase and just move those three to the end, keeping their relative order.
[12:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> If that works, then squashing everything and moving those three to the end should be good.
[12:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise, since that list is so small, just squashing everything is fine.
[12:38:46] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: in that exact order?
[12:39:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, those are in chronological order.
[12:39:08] <mikesherov> e02ec9d0d683c689578efe20d54c05f20c5bb42e, dbb6540d60ba232967a1ed867c6f21459f8e09dd, d1b41325996a0fd621d4572a12d60e6dfcac841c ?
[12:39:11] <mikesherov> ok, cool
[12:39:15] <mikesherov> will try that now
[12:39:21] <mikesherov> hang on a tick
[13:14:05] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Gotta head out again. Taking the kids to gymnastics.
[13:14:11] <mikesherov> OK
[13:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> They have wifi there, but it's usually pretty terrible.
[13:28:07] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15rxaviers pushed 1 new commit to 06AMDify-tests: 02http://git.io/9Viomw

[13:36:41] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Any luck with the rebase?
[13:42:08] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: got pulled away
[13:42:10] <mikesherov> doing now
[13:46:30] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yeah, rebase failed changing the order
[13:46:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok, just squash it all
[13:46:47] <mikesherov> I think I'll just squash all together
[13:46:48] <mikesherov> k
[13:48:38] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: issue a new PR with the squashed version?
[13:48:53] <mikesherov> or can I force push over the old one?
[13:49:03] <scott_gonzalez> Nah, you can just land the squashed commit and use Closes gh-xxx.
[13:49:17] <scott_gonzalez> That way the PR still has the full broken out history and comments.
[13:49:34] <mikesherov> ok
[13:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> Unless for some reason you wanted a review of the commit message.
[13:50:03] <mikesherov> well, we can bikeshed the commit message right now
[13:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise, I don't think the new PR is going to show us anything different than what the current PR shows us.
[13:50:34] <mikesherov> Effects: Rewrite
[13:51:15] <mikesherov> 1. Introduces a set of helper methods to easily create and define new effects.
[13:51:33] <mikesherov> 2. Uses clip animations and placeholder elements instead of wrappers for clip-like effects
[13:52:02] <mikesherov> 3. Ensures all animations are detectable as animated
[13:52:09] <mikesherov> Fixes #....
[13:52:12] <mikesherov> Closes gh-...
[13:52:16] <mikesherov> ? scott_gonzalez ^
[13:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> looks good
[13:52:39] <scott_gonzalez> Just make sure to use separate Fixes #xxx lines for each ticket.
[13:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> That's what jquery-release will look for.
[13:52:49] <mikesherov> 1 line per fixes?
[13:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:52:55] <mikesherov> OK, will do
[13:57:59] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: last look:
[13:58:04] <mikesherov> 1 Effects: Rewrite

[13:58:16] <mikesherov>  16                
[13:58:17] <mikesherov>  17 Closes gh-101
[13:58:18] <mikesherov> gh-1017
[13:59:31] <scott_gonzalez> For some reason, people want the long description hard-wrapped at 80 characters.
[13:59:39] <mikesherov> yeah
[13:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> So #2 needs a line break.
[13:59:42] <mikesherov> I just got yelled at
[13:59:45] <scott_gonzalez> Other than that, looks good.
[13:59:47] <mikesherov> fixing
[13:59:55] <mikesherov> 2. Uses clip animations and placeholders instead of wrappers for clip effects.
