[11:23:02] <ngsilverman> scott_gonzalez: hey, when is someone going to review my PR for interactions?

[13:32:01] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: I just opened up the "unit tests" for droppable options and didn't know whether to laugh or cry
[13:52:37] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: Hey, you around?
[14:00:04] <Dave_Stein> running simulate to match an offset to adroppable and its not working as i think it would
[14:10:46] <Dave_Stein> ah got it, i'm an asshole
[14:14:45] <mikesherov> around
[14:15:00] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: hi!
[14:15:07] <Dave_Stein> hey
[14:15:08] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: I'm back in full swing
[14:15:10] <Dave_Stein> i had a brain lapse is all
[14:15:12] <Dave_Stein> where ya been?
[14:15:15] <mikesherov> after a short hiatus
[14:15:19] <Dave_Stein> i forgot simulate drag says pixels to move
[14:15:20] <mikesherov> Focusing on my busines
[14:15:23] <Dave_Stein> not move to that offset
[14:15:27] <Dave_Stein> good ole dating :)
[14:15:31] <Dave_Stein> i was away for 2 weeks as well
[14:15:32] <mikesherov> yup
[14:15:35] <Dave_Stein> got back a week before you
[14:15:37] <mikesherov> Cool
[14:15:47] <mikesherov> So, can we catch up for a minute
[14:16:07] <mikesherov> I see ngsilverman is ramping up on interactions as well
[14:16:14] <Dave_Stein> yeah we had a long meeting about the APIs
[14:16:21] <Dave_Stein> im working on the droppable tests cause im "done" 
[14:16:30] <Dave_Stein> then i gotta look into multiple touches etc
[14:16:35] <mikesherov> done with draggable and droppable?
[14:16:36] <Dave_Stein> ngsilverman is sortable-ing it up
[14:16:46] <Dave_Stein> supposedly done with droppable minus these tests
[14:16:48] <Dave_Stein> we'll see what they find
[14:16:57] <Dave_Stein> there were 0 tests for optoins
[14:17:06] <Dave_Stein> i made shouldDrop and shouldNotDrop real so tests are freaking out about that too
[14:18:07] <mikesherov> yeah
[14:18:11] <mikesherov> fun\
[14:18:16] <Dave_Stein> always
[14:19:24] <Dave_Stein> oh i need to put the why in 
[14:19:26] <Dave_Stein> womp wah
[14:21:28] <mikesherov> so, you did draggable and droppable with as much backcompat as we wanted
[14:21:41] <mikesherov> and ngsilverman is backporting sortable
[14:22:09] <mikesherov> which just leaves resizable and selectable
[14:22:14] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[14:22:23] <Dave_Stein> i'm gonna start on resizable when i get to multi touch events
[14:22:46] <mikesherov> cool. So you are writing tests for draggable and droppable
[14:22:57] <mikesherov> and I suppose that's close now too
[14:23:07] <mikesherov> and then we were also doing the "master_tests" branch
[14:23:12] <mikesherov> any movement there?
[14:24:08] <Dave_Stein> ah whoops
[14:24:31] <Dave_Stein> okay so master_tests should have all the draggable for options... was waiting on you to do the ones for prior tickets
[14:25:14] <Dave_Stein> i was just about to commit my droppable tests to interactions... but i can do that to master tests instead and then merge into interactions
[14:25:27] <Dave_Stein> or i can cherry-pick into master tests 
[14:26:05] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: what do you think?
[14:27:00] <mikesherov> so, the goal of master_tests was to get the tests into master ASAP
[14:27:17] <mikesherov> so anything you can get workign there first would be great
[14:27:40] <mikesherov> so the second option makes sense to me
[14:27:47] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: i was just about to commit my droppable tests to interactions... but i can do that to master tests instead and then merge into interactions
[14:27:54] <mikesherov> ^ that option
[14:28:40] <Dave_Stein> okay cool
[14:28:46] <mikesherov> I'll review what you have in master_tests and see what can get merged in
[14:28:48] <Dave_Stein> ill stash and change branches
[14:28:56] <Dave_Stein> give me one second
[14:29:00] <Dave_Stein> just wanna finish up another test then :D
[14:29:13] <mikesherov> OK
[14:31:09] <mikesherov> so Dave_Stein allow me to be pedantic for a moment
[14:31:25] <Dave_Stein> go for it
[14:31:51] <mikesherov> you said you guys reviewed the planned API's for interactionsâ€¦ I assume that included all remaining interactions, and what get cuts immediately, and what becomes backCompat for eventual cutting?
[14:32:06] <Dave_Stein> yeah i updated the wiki 
[14:32:11] <Dave_Stein> well 
[14:32:12] <Dave_Stein> sorry
[14:32:17] <mikesherov> Awesome, for all interactions?
[14:32:20] <Dave_Stein> we setup sortable and droppable
[14:32:25] <Dave_Stein> resizable and the other wernet discussed yet
[14:32:58] <Dave_Stein> sidenote.. is there any standard for the "why" in equal?
[14:33:02] <Dave_Stein> do we need one for every case?
[14:33:17] <mikesherov> OK, so I can calibrate my brainâ€¦ just confirm the following
[14:33:46] <mikesherov> draggable: feature complete, needs full test coverage, wiki updated
[14:34:50] <mikesherov> droppable: feature complete, needs full test coverage, wiki updated
[14:35:09] <Dave_Stein> yes
[14:35:17] <Dave_Stein> sortable: NOT feature complete, needs full test coverage, wiki updated
[14:35:27] <mikesherov> sortable: features in the works, needs full test coverage, wiki updated
[14:35:29] <mikesherov> right
[14:35:34] <Dave_Stein> there is one failing test in draggable i need to look at, that i could have sworn was passing >.>
[14:36:10] <mikesherov> selectable: features in the works, needs full test coverage, wiki not updated
[14:36:10] <mikesherov> resizable: features in the works, needs full test coverage, wiki not updated
[14:36:34] <Dave_Stein> yeah but not really in the works cause no one worked on anything
[14:36:35] <Dave_Stein> :D
[14:36:42] <Dave_Stein> im about to update master tests
[14:37:05] <mikesherov> OK, cool
[14:37:42] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: sidenote: there is no standard for "why" in equal
[14:38:33] <Dave_Stein> god damn master tests are boned haha
[14:38:37] <Dave_Stein> draggable is not a function apparently
[14:38:38] <Dave_Stein> :P
[14:38:40] <Dave_Stein> ill add it in
[14:39:15] <Dave_Stein> ah yeah... master_tests needs mouse.js
[14:39:21] <Dave_Stein> after merging in they need interaction.js instead
[14:39:34] <mikesherov> wait, what?
[14:39:53] <mikesherov> master_tests is supposed to only get the units, not the src files
[14:40:02] <Dave_Stein> yeah you're right
[14:40:16] <Dave_Stein> remember i was working in interactions, stashed, popped, then i corrected what i popped heh
[14:40:24] <Dave_Stein> fuck these tests fail in master
[14:40:52] <Dave_Stein> is drop not supposed to fire if you pick up and drop in same exact spot?
[14:41:33] <mikesherov> I dunno
[14:41:35] <Dave_Stein> oh oh
[14:41:39] <mikesherov> that's why tests are fun
[14:41:55] <Dave_Stein> hmmm that's not it
[14:42:09] <Dave_Stein> i changed it so before testing drag to coordinates, i simulate to 0,0 then move back and still no dice
[14:42:41] <Dave_Stein> is there anything diff in simulate that's in master?
[14:42:59] <Dave_Stein> i'll commit so you can take a look

[14:45:33] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: ^^ between the two auto messages
[14:46:04] <mikesherov> I'll take a look
[14:46:21] <Dave_Stein> thanks
[14:46:29] <Dave_Stein> if you answer that i can finish off the tests for options in no time
[14:46:40] <mikesherov> so, I know old simulate always did at least a 1 pixel move
[14:46:49] <mikesherov> checkout simulateDrag
[14:46:54] <mikesherov> on the interactions branch
[14:47:09] <mikesherov> even if you did 0,0, it did a +1,+1
[14:47:16] <mikesherov> crazy, right?
[14:47:21] <Dave_Stein> haha
[14:47:32] <Dave_Stein> but that one pixel off should still make a drop
[14:47:38] <Dave_Stein> unless i was doing "fit"
[14:47:48] <Dave_Stein> and even so, im going to top left of element and the draggable is much smaller so it would still hit
[14:48:37] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov the .height/width setter always sets content width doesn't it?
[14:48:45] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13384
[14:48:47] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: fixing now
[14:48:50] <mikesherov> see my comment
[14:48:53] <DaveMethvin> oh
[14:49:06] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: simulateDrag looks the same between interactions and master
[14:49:14] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/jquery.simulate.js
[14:49:16] <mikesherov> it does?
[14:49:18] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/tests/jquery.simulate.js
[14:49:31] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/a677ea7dc01b71028af94c3b5b9fa82d401cd98c
[14:49:32] <b-ot> mikesherov: Mike Sherov (2mon 1w ago): Dev: update jquery.simulate.js to latest version from http://github.com/jquery/jquery-simulate
[14:49:48] <mikesherov> I don't know if that made it into interactions
[14:49:55] <mikesherov> or even into master_tests
[14:49:56] <Dave_Stein> sure looks it
[14:50:05] <Dave_Stein> oh maybe not master tests tho!
[14:50:05] <mikesherov> maybe master_tests is wrong
[14:50:15] <mikesherov> the joys of branching
[14:50:31] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master_tests/tests/jquery.simulate.js
[14:50:33] <Dave_Stein> still looks the same
[14:50:42] <Dave_Stein> all are 312 lines
[14:51:08] <Dave_Stein> and all 3 have that commit as the last one :D
[14:52:04] <Dave_Stein> and i'm not crazy right: $(target).on( "drop", function() { is the way it was on old one too?
[14:52:06] <Dave_Stein> ha
[14:52:23] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master_tests/tests/unit/droppable/droppable_test_helpers.js
[14:53:15] <mikesherov> so, is master_tests broken in a way that master and interactions aren't?
[14:53:54] <Dave_Stein> as far as i could tell
[14:53:59] <Dave_Stein> shouldDrop was working perfect in interactions
[14:54:05] <Dave_Stein> i didnt commit it, stashed, ported to master_tests instead
[14:54:46] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: api.jquery.com docs updated
[14:55:31] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: you can commit your changes to interactions
[14:55:36] <mikesherov> it's fine if it's in both
[14:56:10] <mikesherov> I just want it *also* in master_tests, not necessarily *instead of*
[14:56:20] <Dave_Stein> i like a history rather than copy paste separate commits
[14:56:26] <Dave_Stein> i can just merge master_tests into interactions
[14:56:47] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/master_tests
[14:56:52] <Dave_Stein> im gonna do that now and see what happens :)
[14:57:08] <Dave_Stein> yes?
[14:57:09] <mikesherov> doesn't seem to have my version of simulate, does it?
[14:57:27] <Dave_Stein> what do you mean
[14:57:28] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master_tests/tests/jquery.simulate.js
[14:57:31] <Dave_Stein> im looking right at it there 
[14:57:31] <mikesherov> nvm
[14:57:33] <mikesherov> it does
[14:58:27] <Dave_Stein> ick such graphic conflits
[14:59:03] <mikesherov> so, I'm running master_tests
[14:59:09] <mikesherov> and droppable and draggable are fine for me
[14:59:23] <mikesherov> 100% passing
[14:59:42] <mikesherov> oh, now they aren't
[15:00:09] <mikesherov> draggable passes 100%, droppable is a nightmare
[15:00:19] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[15:00:23] <Dave_Stein> the last ones are the ones that matter that are from me
[15:00:30] <Dave_Stein> for accept and acitveClass
[15:00:33] <Dave_Stein> shouldDrop fails every time
[15:01:07] <mikesherov> and passes on interactions?
[15:01:11] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[15:01:15] <Dave_Stein> just trying to fix conflict nightmare
[15:01:19] <mikesherov> ok, lemme investigate
[15:01:26] <mikesherov> are they using the same versions of core?
[15:01:38] <Dave_Stein> not sure offhand
[15:04:16] <mikesherov> yeah, they are
[15:04:30] <Dave_Stein> i think i finished my merge into interactions
[15:04:34] <Dave_Stein> but lots more tests failing in draggable
[15:04:43] <Dave_Stein> meanwhile the droppable tests definitely work
[15:05:08] <Dave_Stein> cursorAt is so unhappy with me haha
[15:05:21] <mikesherov> cursorAt is the one we cleaned up in master and master_tests
[15:05:57] <Dave_Stein> actually im gonna abort my merge right now again and get these extra functions into master_tests
[15:06:02] <mikesherov> yes
[15:06:08] <mikesherov> I was gonna suggest that
[15:06:21] <mikesherov> get whatever you can into master tests
[15:06:38] <Dave_Stein> ok AFAIK the only tests i put into interactions by mistake were for blockframes
[15:06:42] <Dave_Stein> which im putting into master_tests now
[15:06:44] <Dave_Stein> then ill do the merge again
[15:07:52] <Dave_Stein> hmmm
[15:09:16] <Dave_Stein> looks like simulate is wonky in general but cant put my finger on it
[15:09:21] <Dave_Stein> put these other tests into master_tests
[15:09:27] <Dave_Stein> and it looks like "drag" is never firing
[15:09:44] <mikesherov> simulateDrag never fires an actual drag event
[15:10:00] <Dave_Stein> ah no .on("drag") is still working
[15:10:36] <Dave_Stein> im just being silly... these tests shouldnt go into master tests
[15:10:44] <Dave_Stein> cause iframeFix is so different in interactions 
[15:10:46] <Dave_Stein> its not the same at all
[15:10:49] <Dave_Stein> thats why they are failing
[15:11:11] <mikesherov> are we talking draggable, or droppable?
[15:11:14] <Dave_Stein> draggable
[15:11:21] <mikesherov> wait
[15:11:24] <Dave_Stein> draggable interactions has 3 new tests that cant go into master_tests
[15:11:31] <Dave_Stein> droppable has a bunch of new tests that SHOLD work in master_tests
[15:11:44] <mikesherov> draggable: provide backCompat for all existing options for 2.0, except for iframeFix, distance, delay, and addClasses
[15:11:56] <Dave_Stein> right cause iframefix IS _blockFrames which is always on
[15:12:02] <Dave_Stein> so i made tests for that after we realized it was a lil buggy
[15:12:26] <mikesherov> iframeFix, distance, delay, nor addClasses should get tests in master_tests
[15:12:39] <mikesherov> SHOULD NOT
[15:12:44] <mikesherov> should not get tests
[15:12:59] <Dave_Stein> youre right
[15:13:12] <Dave_Stein> im gonna make test for blockFrames but put them into core rather than options
[15:13:14] <Dave_Stein> i think that was my mistake
[15:14:43] <mikesherov> yeah, we explicitly removed them
[15:15:27] <Dave_Stein> yeah its not an option cause now it justs runs no matter what
[15:15:31] <Dave_Stein> so made unit test for that bit of code
[15:15:34] <Dave_Stein> make sense now?
[15:15:37] <mikesherov> yeah
[15:15:58] <mikesherov> so, just so I get actually become useful here, once you merge whatever you got into draggable, I'll finish writing the tests for draggable
[15:16:16] <Dave_Stein> okay so boom
[15:16:18] <Dave_Stein> done
[15:16:24] <Dave_Stein> i merged master_tests into interactions
[15:16:35] <Dave_Stein> interactions has a few tests that master_tests dont in regards to iframes
[15:16:44] <mikesherov> OK, that's fine
[15:16:48] <Dave_Stein> so final update here
[15:16:57] <Dave_Stein> droppable tests i wrote work in interactions, not in master_tests
[15:16:59] <jquicommit> 01[13jquery-ui01] 15DaveStein pushed 2 new commits to 06interactions: 02http://git.io/EOMPQQ
[15:16:59] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06interactions 140d7385f 15Dave Stein: Unit Tests: Merged from master_tests. Corrected _blockFrames location
[15:16:59] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06interactions 14e530510 15Dave Stein: Droppable Unit: Swapped `mouse.js` for `interaction.js`
[15:17:12] <Dave_Stein> so we still dont know why that's the case cause shouldDrop is just using simulate
[15:17:25] <Dave_Stein> draggable: many tests are blowing up in interactions sine i took the new tests for cursorat and then some
[15:17:45] <mikesherov> OK, so I'm actually going to work on master_tests 
[15:17:47] <Dave_Stein> soooooo i'm gonna go back to interactions and see what's up with draggable
[15:17:51] <Dave_Stein> yes
[15:17:59] <Dave_Stein> if you can figure out why shoulddrop isnt working there, that would be awesome
[15:18:08] <mikesherov> and fill out that suite for draggable, and then for droppable
[15:18:18] <mikesherov> while you continue to smash it up on interactions
[15:18:47] <Dave_Stein> okay cool cause it seems when more tests get merged into interactions, more things will blow up that i'll need to fix in interactions :D
[15:19:03] <mikesherov> right
[15:19:06] <mikesherov> that's the point :-)
[15:19:07] <Dave_Stein> hopefully my 20 minute headstart on droppable unit helps you out
[15:19:15] <mikesherov> so you have no more commits for master_tests, right?
[15:19:19] <mikesherov> I can go to work now?
[15:19:21] <Dave_Stein> im probably gonna spend time researching multiple touch events tomorrow
[15:19:24] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[15:19:50] <mikesherov> cool
[15:19:57] <mikesherov> thanks again for all your hard work, Dave_Stein 
[15:20:01] <mikesherov> you going to Toronto?
[15:20:04] <Dave_Stein> no prob
[15:20:08] <Dave_Stein> i dont think so? heh
[15:20:11] <Dave_Stein> ill be at jsconf this year
[15:20:15] <mikesherov> cool
[15:20:46] <Dave_Stein> besides, we're both in city so toronoto is pretty far to see you haha
[15:20:48] <Dave_Stein> which conf is there
[15:27:40] <mikesherov> jQueryTo
[15:28:54] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: .on("dragstop") not firing for some reason in unit... does in my demo page 
[15:29:02] <Dave_Stein> test( "stopping the stop callback", function() {
[15:29:05] <Dave_Stein> draggable_events.js
[15:29:17] <Dave_Stein> its not going into stop: function() nor .on( "dragstop" )
[15:29:43] <mikesherov> and that works in master?
[15:30:14] <mikesherov> yeah, it works in master_tests
[15:30:33] <Dave_Stein> jeez what could be the difference here
[15:32:10] <Dave_Stein> oh there's an exception i see in chrome, but no message in ff
