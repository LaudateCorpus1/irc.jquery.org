[07:18:39] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: the reason I ask is that I want to properly JSHint all of the files, and datepicker has ~450 violations. I want to make sure I don't create a ton of conflicts if someone is already using the existing code as a starting point

[11:39:49] <mikesherov> no reason to keep bad styling in the code even if there's a rewrite coming

[22:07:03] <kborchers> does anyone have windows with ie6 on a vm or something other than browserstack just to make sure it is definitely broken? in browserstack, ie6 totally crashes on the dialog unit tests in the dialog branch
