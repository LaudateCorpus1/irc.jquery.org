[01:51:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what's up?
[01:57:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Columntoggle table has a bunch of style options that are not yet documented, so we could remove them without deprecation.
[01:57:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: As part of table review, should I do that?
[01:57:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: morning
[01:57:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: one sec, lemme look
[01:58:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey *wave*
[02:00:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you give an example?
[02:01:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: columnBtnTheme, columnPopupTheme, 
[02:01:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess there's no easy way to get rid of those.
[02:02:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: those are documented
[02:04:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, that's right - it's a different entry. We should consolidate those.
[02:04:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I think we agreed not to document extensions separately 
[02:53:14] <gnu_d> Hi, will merging all the js scripts and compressing them will drastically improve the speed of loading stuff ?
[03:14:56] <uGoMobi> gnu_d: hi, you can ask support questions on the #jquery channel
[03:15:30] <gnu_d> uGoMobi: ok
[04:42:20] <gnu_d> ok, now this is development related quesion, if I build custom jquery download builder, how to know if it impacts jqm ? Cause I want to build jqm custom too 
[04:42:39] <gnu_d> s/download/with download/
[05:19:19] <arschmitz> gnu_d: thats still a support question this channel is for the developers of jquery-ui and jquery-mobile to discuss development of the librarys
[05:19:50] <gnu_d> arschmitz: but I need developer inside info, from code stance
[05:49:49] <Mottie> I'm not sure if I need to open a bug report, but when I look at this modal popup: http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal I am seeing a background added to the overlay which doesn't look right
[05:50:01] <Mottie> .ui-widget-overlayÂ {background:Â #aaaaaaÂ url(images/ui-bg_flat_0_aaaaaa_40x100.png) 50% 50% repeat-x; opacity:Â .3;filter:Â Alpha(Opacity=30); }
