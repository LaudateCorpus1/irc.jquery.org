[06:26:06] <doesallmagic> kris.borchers: Button demos: Fix selector since demo wrapper div was removed
[07:06:28] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: around?
[07:06:42] <jzaefferer> would like to discuss themeroller and the jqueryui.com integration
[07:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Thanks for fixing that.
[07:37:13] <kborchers> np
[07:37:16] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez
[07:37:53] <jzaefferer> sorry for the bad commit on jqueryui.com - thanks for the revert. Though looking at the state of things, I'd like to merge both themeroller branches in their respective repos and get that up on stage
[07:38:26] <jzaefferer> Testing themeroller within the site locally isn't really possible with our current setup without recreating the nginx redirects locally
[07:39:01] <jzaefferer> ThemeRoller can be tested otherwise with the standalone server, so getting it on stage would make things a lot easier at this point
[07:39:02] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm good with merging everything. I think rxaviers said he wanted to clean some stuff up first for a cleaner history.
[07:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm not really concerned with that.
[07:39:18] <jzaefferer> Yeah, the code needs cleanup, I don't care much about the history
[07:39:53] <jzaefferer> Okay, so I'll merge and push, then see what problems remain up on stage
[07:40:23] <jzaefferer> There's an obvious styling issue with ThemeRoller. Apart from that I want to see if the whole customize-theme-download-that actually works
[07:41:37] <jzaefferer> meh, git thinks themeroller branch is already merged on the jqueryui.com repo
[07:41:47] <jzaefferer> the commits are there, but got reverted
[07:41:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: revert revert?
[07:43:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:43:49] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, what a mess.
[07:45:30] <jzaefferer> okay
[07:45:40] <jzaefferer> apart from that, it looks like not much is left for 1.9
[07:45:47] <jzaefferer> "Figure out how to handle 1-8.api.jqueryui.com" <- any details on that?
[07:46:02] <jzaefferer> "Need to finish home page, add other pages" <- same here
[07:49:36] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to do api.jqueryui.com/1.8/
[07:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> nacin claims that creating a new site is as simple as adding another entry to domains.php.
[07:50:06] <scott_gonzalez> He said he was going to test and verify, but I haven't heard back, so I'm going to test that today.
[07:50:11] <scott_gonzalez> I already went through and updated all the docs.
[07:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> So 1.8 docs are much better and more complete than what's on docs.jquery.com/UI
[07:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> I finished the jqueryui.com home page: http://stage.jqueryui.com/
[07:51:18] <scott_gonzalez> I need to create a demos page that just links off to all the individual pages (mostly just so that we have /demos/ as a functional URL).
[07:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> I think I'm going to drop /development/
[07:52:08] <scott_gonzalez> At least for now.
[07:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> There's a lot of info that needs to be updated.
[07:52:53] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: btw … I have a bunch of style fixes about to be pushed.
[07:53:04] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Fixing the sidebar?
[07:53:15] <kswedberg> yep.
[07:53:38] <kswedberg> and gluing the footer to the bottom if the page is shorter than the viewport
[07:53:43] <scott_gonzalez> nice
[07:54:06] <scott_gonzalez> My css-fu has been pretty weak. I tried a few times to fix the sidebar and failed.
[07:54:37] <kswedberg> well, I broke it, so technically it's my responsibility. :)
[07:56:06] <scott_gonzalez> If that's the case, Where's Paul Bakaus to fix all of these interaction bugs :-P
[07:56:14] <kswedberg> ahahaha

[08:12:14] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: all fixed. http://stage.jqueryui.com/
[08:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> \o/ YAY \o/
[08:13:42] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: failed to install our logger module, due to node-syslog: https://gist.github.com/a21d66ceb5d809a2e600
[08:13:46] <jzaefferer> any idea what's going on there?
[08:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: hmm... http://stage.blog.jqueryui.com/2012/08/jquery-ui-1-9-rc/
[08:14:55] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: looking into it
[08:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: That's odd, we've installed it before.
[08:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like a permissions problem.
[08:15:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf?
[08:16:37] <jzaefferer> Aaaah, debugging… adding the logger to debug a problem with the grunt task, then ending up debugging the logger...
[08:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[08:17:55] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I don't see blog.jqueryui.com theme in web-base-template.
[08:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Oh, right.
[08:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> Can you copy your CSS changes over to https://github.com/jquery/blog.jqueryui.com-theme ?
[08:18:33] <kswedberg> ugh. srsly? :)
[08:18:43] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I can do it.
[08:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> Just this? https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/9cff6697e14394d6a56b407d7750540c13994b1c
[08:18:54] <jzaefferer> good argument for not keeping that separate blog around beyond the 1.9 release..
[08:18:54] <kswedberg> no no. it's fine.
[08:19:20] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yup, we would've done it for real except that core isn't ready.
[08:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> We just need to create the new jquery.com in order to move the blog into the right place.
[08:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't be too bad to do when things calm down a bit.
[08:20:08] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: that's it for the sidebar, yeah.
[08:20:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I can do it easily if you want.
[08:20:41] <kswedberg> ok, sure. thanks!
[08:23:44] <scott_gonzalez> FIXED!

[08:30:43] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Also use better check for scope arg - Jörn Zaefferer
[08:31:03] <jzaefferer> so `cp -r tmp/api.jqueryui.com/dist/wordpress/posts/post/ target` makes a flat copy of the files within that post folder, unless something is weird and it includes the post folder in the target directory - WHYYYYYYYYY?
[08:32:53] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: http://stage.jqueryui.com/changelog/1.9.0/ - that'll get generated as part of the release?
[08:33:17] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: demos index is also missing: http://stage.jqueryui.com/demos/
[08:34:22] <jzaefferer> can we include the stage. rewrite on http://stage.blog.jqueryui.com/ ?
[08:34:24] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yes, the changelog will be generated (the shell anyway), during the release.
[08:34:39] <scott_gonzalez> Read up a bit and you'll see that I said I still need to create /demos/ :-P
[08:35:10] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Maybe? It's not really worth the effort to do anything on stage.blog
[08:35:27] <jzaefferer> okay okay :-)
[08:36:52] <jzaefferer> that cp error is really annoying

[08:53:36] <jzaefferer> okay

[08:54:11] <scott_gonzalez> It started downloading right away, so that should be the important part.
[08:54:15] <jzaefferer> looks like most time is just spent streaming the zip file, building it should be really fast
[08:54:20] <scott_gonzalez> Time to generate the zip and start streaming, right?
[08:54:32] <jzaefferer> its streaming everything
[08:54:48] <jzaefferer> that is, there's no separate step before it starts streaming
[08:55:18] <jzaefferer> deploying themeroller to stage now
[08:55:28] <jzaefferer> could've done that before pushing my commits...
[08:55:30] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, so it's streaming the zip to the user as it adds files?
[08:55:39] <jzaefferer> yeah
[08:55:46] <jzaefferer> where the files are mostly in memory already
[08:56:15] <jzaefferer> including a theme will slow that down though
[08:56:51] <jzaefferer> let's see: http://stage.jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[08:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> Testing meeting today?
[08:58:31] <jzaefferer> next week
[09:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> Is TR supposed to work right now?
[09:00:16] <jzaefferer> not really
[09:00:18] <jzaefferer> working on that
[09:01:24] <jzaefferer> okay, now selecting themes from the gallery actually updates something
[09:01:34] <jzaefferer> and customizing theme works
[09:01:47] <jzaefferer> download that custom theme, not so much

[09:56:09] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: now would be an interesting moment to test themeroller on stage, it should actually work
[09:56:32] <jzaefferer> you'll likely spot a bunch of issues within seconds, but at least the download, including custom theme, should work
[09:57:15] <scott_gonzalez> Took about 7 seconds.
[09:57:20] <scott_gonzalez> Definitely took longer to start.
[09:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> But this is also peak hours now.
[09:57:34] <scott_gonzalez> Lunch break.
[09:57:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get more reliable numbers at home.
[09:58:20] <scott_gonzalez> But it did download and I got the correct theme.
[10:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer rxaviers: TR has a flash when changing setings that the old TR doesn't have.
[10:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> There's a FOUW :-P Flash Of Unstyled Widgets
[10:10:36] <jzaefferer> yep, might be just a matter of removing the old <link> element after the new one is done loading
[10:10:48] <jzaefferer> currently fixing the styling issues
[10:10:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's probably all that's needed.
[10:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> We also need to fix the dependency handling in download bulider when unchecking a dependency.
[10:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> For example, unchecking widget should not uncheck everything.
[10:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> It should warn me.
[10:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf Krinkle|detached: Can you remove the redirect from docs.jquery.com/UI?
[10:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> Also, "The references on docs.jquery.com are obsolete. Please see http://api.jqueryui.com for up-to-date documentation." was a bad idea.
[10:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> We can't point to a site that doesn't exist.
[10:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> And the API docs for UI are not obsolete.
[10:28:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: brought back /UI
[10:28:13] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[10:28:26] <gnarf> where is this quote coming from?

[10:30:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that page has said that for a while now
[10:30:58] <gnarf> jzaefferer: did you get my poke about the Validation docs?
[10:31:22] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, ok
[10:31:44] <jzaefferer> gnarf: no?
[10:32:06] <gnarf> jzaefferer: can you reproduce the docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation page on the validation page on your own site?
[10:32:11] <gnarf> so I can redirect there?
[10:32:18] <gnarf> since docs is destined to die
[10:33:05] <jzaefferer> I actually did that once, then messed up the mediawiki install and attracted some spammers
[10:33:11] <jzaefferer> I guess I have to do that again
[10:33:23] <jzaefferer> "porting" the theme/skin with all the templates is a pretty big PITA
[10:34:31] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Convert to XML and use grunt-jquery-content?
[10:34:45] <scott_gonzalez> You'd just need to style the pages.
[10:34:46] <jzaefferer> yeah, that's what I actually want to do
[10:35:11] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: found the old text for that section in the history and restored it
[10:35:25] <jzaefferer> gnarf: can it wait until after the 1.9 release?

[11:24:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: jq02.stage.jquery.com:/usr/local/wordpress-repos/jqueryui.com
[11:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> crap
[11:33:18] <scott_gonzalez> this is totally hosed now
[11:33:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you know what would cause this? gyp ERR! stack Error: EACCES, stat '/root/.node-gyp/0.8.6'
[11:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> What's dialout?
[11:35:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: are you trying to npm install as root or something?
[11:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:35:50] <gnarf> try sudo -u jqdeploy
[11:36:04] <gnarf> all the stuff in there should be owned/execed by jqdeploy
[11:36:12] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:36:32] <scott_gonzalez> I've been using `sudo bash` for everything.
[11:36:35] <gnarf> might wanna chown -R it too
[11:36:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thats fine, but for some things (the wordpress sites in particular) it uses a non-priv user -- you can sudo -u jqdeploy bash too
[11:37:24] <scott_gonzalez> chown -R /root/.node-gyp ?
[11:37:48] <gnarf> no the wordpress folder
[11:37:52] <gnarf> there are some files owned by root now
[11:38:42] <gnarf> chown -R jqdeploy /usr/local/wordpress-repos/
[11:39:29] <gnarf> if you want to try a "fresh start" you can just rm -rf /usr/local/wordpress-repos/jqueryui.com and then sudo puppet agent --test
[11:39:36] <gnarf> it should reinstall everything
[11:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: So this is the permission problem you got before.
[11:41:42] <scott_gonzalez> You were logged in as root, weren't you?
[11:47:55] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, much better.
[11:48:10] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer rxaviers: We need to stop using git repos as dependencies.
[11:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: That means we'll need to release a version of the logger module too.
[11:48:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems stable enough to call 0.1.0
[11:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: 1.0.0 even :-)
[11:48:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: although I did have a minor improvement to suggest
[11:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> The problem with git repos is that npm never thinks it needs to update.
[11:49:17] <scott_gonzalez> What's the improvement?
[11:49:19] <gnarf> thats why I added npm -q update; npm -q install
[11:49:27] <gnarf> cuz only install will update the git repo
[11:49:28] <gnarf> right
[11:49:29] <gnarf> ?
[11:49:49] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think install updates the git repos.
[11:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> Because version info never changes.
[11:50:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: is it possible to get the logger.log( abc, def ) style console.log() syntax working?
[11:50:10] <gnarf> also
[11:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> Just for strings or for all types?
[11:50:50] <gnarf> would it be possible to either a) write up a quick doc on how to do it in the app, or b) write some sort of uncaught error handler that can give syslog enough time to actually write to the log before it exits the proc?
[11:51:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Well, the way to do that is to never call process.exit().
[11:52:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I don't think the stuff I'm using does call process.exit() but if it gets an uncaught, it exits itself right?
[11:52:46] <scott_gonzalez> If you don't have an uncaughtException handler, then it will exit.
[11:52:57] <scott_gonzalez> Every script should have an uncaughtException handler.
[11:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> The existence of the handler will prevent the script from force exiting.
[11:53:52] <gnarf> k
[11:54:08] <scott_gonzalez> The problem with adding one inside the logger is that if you then forget to add one to the main script, the script may continue running in a broken state.
[11:54:32] <gnarf> Well i was thinking like a utility
[11:54:40] <gnarf> for the "generic handler" which just does a log of the error
[11:54:54] <gnarf> logger.catchErrors()
[11:55:11] <gnarf> or smth
[11:56:57] <scott_gonzalez> It feels really unsafe to me.
[11:57:36] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, if you've got a top-to-bottom script that just does one thing and exits, you can add:
[11:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> process.on( "uncaughtException", function( error ) {
[11:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> 	logger.error( "Uncaught exception: " + error.stack );
[11:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> });
[11:58:08] <scott_gonzalez> But for anything else, you'll want to make sure your script is designed to cleanly exit on failure.
[11:58:24] <scott_gonzalez> What that means is impossible to know for something generic like the logger.
[11:59:29] <scott_gonzalez> This page could use some styling, but there's content now: http://stage.jqueryui.com/demos/
[12:02:02] <gnarf> seems fair scott_gonzalez - was just a thought, didn't know it was that simple
[12:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> for logger.log( abc, def ) do you just want support for strings?
[12:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> Or did you want it to support arrays/objects like console.log?
[12:04:57] <gnarf> i'd like it to feel as console.logish as possible
[12:05:22] <gnarf> i've forgotten what it was
[12:05:33] <gnarf> but i found the function they use to decorate stuff for console.log once
[12:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> util.inspect()?
[12:08:08] <gnarf> yah
[12:09:35] <gnarf> bbiab
[12:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> util.inspect() is a little gross because of all the quoting and escaping.
[12:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> But we could just run it on objects.
[12:14:25] <gnarf> non strings?
[12:15:48] <gnarf> eventually I'm gonna make a "node syslog" template in puppet so that we can pipe all these to their own files
[12:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's kind of gross even for arrays.
[12:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> ['a','b'] vs. a,b
[12:17:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez:
[12:17:24] <gnarf> something is awkward with the demos btw
[12:17:25] <scott_gonzalez> We could convert to JSON
[12:17:42] <gnarf> specifically resizable demo
[12:18:00] <gnarf> the IFRAME it's in is deceptively small
[12:18:13] <gnarf> and mouseup outside of the iframe will obviously not cause a mouseup
[12:19:33] <gnarf> random maybe cool idea - could we just make jsbin demos?
[12:19:47] <scott_gonzalez> We can't do anything right now.
[12:20:01] <gnarf> obviously this is not important
[12:20:15] <gnarf> but it seems like an idea worth looking at some less stressful day
[12:20:28] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer filed this a long time ago: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5769
[12:20:54] <gnarf> which repo should that go on?
[12:21:00] <gnarf> we can make it an issue
[12:21:18] <gnarf> jqueryui.com ?
[12:21:31] <scott_gonzalez> Make what an issue? The existing ticket or moving all of our demos into jsbin?
[12:25:06] <gnarf> the ticket - seems to make sense as an issue on jqueryui.com
[12:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, though I'd rather figure out what we're actually doing with the demos on the site first.
[12:26:07] <scott_gonzalez> All of the existing demos are going away.
[12:27:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We've intentionally not been closing/moving issues yet.
[12:27:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: damn
[12:27:49] <gnarf> did i mess it up?
[12:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> Don't worry about it.
[12:27:56] <gnarf> good
[12:27:58] <gnarf> cuz it made sense
[12:27:59] <gnarf> :)
[12:28:03] <gnarf> why not?
[12:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> Because we don't want to move issues to sites that aren't launched.
[12:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> It also screws up the changelog.
[12:31:17] <scott_gonzalez> Everything that we fix will get missed.
[12:42:43] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf:
[12:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> > l.error( "there", "are", 5, [ "different", "arguments" ], { "in": "this", "call": true } )
[12:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> test[68291]: there are 5 [ 'different', 'arguments' ] { in: 'this', call: true }
[12:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> That's util.inspect() on everything expect strings and strings passed through directly.
[12:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> Then joined on space.
[12:45:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, I'm an idiot.
[12:45:47] <scott_gonzalez> I should just use util.format().
[12:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Committed.

[14:38:41] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Late night as in you'll be busy with other stuff or you'll be up late so you'll have time?
[14:40:30] <gnarf> heh
[14:40:39] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ah, now I read all the above history. More up-to-date now.
[14:40:56] <gnarf> or Late Night -- "Coding on bourbon" like danheberden
[14:41:13] <rxaviers> I will work on the remaining items of my TODO list, please just let me know if you find any problem in TR / download b
[14:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Is it ready to merge into master?
[14:42:29] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I saw it's already merged..
[14:42:36] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[14:42:39] <rxaviers> heh
[14:42:45] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you're welcome to fix anything that I missed. Specifically the theme configuration needs attention (scope/folder name). And to get the URL into the CSS file.
[14:43:00] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I asked you about merging it earlier, that's how it got on staging
[14:43:21] <jzaefferer> Unlike site content, download builder can't be just deployed from local code to stage
[14:43:23] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, URL into the CSS file should be working, anything wrong?
[14:43:37] <jzaefferer> uh, okay, maybe I didn't actually check that in a while
[14:43:47] <rxaviers> ok, scope should be working as well
[14:44:20] <rxaviers> I noticed that picking some named themes gives me custom-theme folder name in download builder. Will check that.
[14:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Merged into jquery-ui?
[14:44:51] <rxaviers> into download.jqueryui.com/master
[14:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'm waiting for the jquery-ui updates.
[14:45:15] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: when you select a theme from the gallery and click download, it'll set it to "Custom Theme" instead of the preset name
[14:45:25] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I need to finish the release script.
[14:45:26] <rxaviers> Right, I saw that too.. Will check
[14:45:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: oh, that. Yeah, there's another branch we can land
[14:47:03] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the URL in the CSS file uses a query string, but themeroller now expects a hash / ignores the query string
[14:47:17] <jzaefferer> so the URL is there, but doesn't really work as intended
[14:47:21] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, when de-selecting components with dependencies selected, how should it warn user?
[14:47:59] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ah! ok will change
[14:48:30] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[14:48:30] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - git core build #121: FIXED in 34 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/121/
[14:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: The existing site pops up a dialog and tells you to unselect the depending components.
[14:49:19] <jzaefferer> Is that really something we want?
[14:49:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's really naive and just lists the first one it finds.
[14:49:36] <gnarf> rxaviers: could you disable the check when a dependant is checked and avoid the issue alltogether, or does it feel weird?
[14:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> What we should do is list out all depending components and just ask the user if they're sure.
[14:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> Give them yes and no buttons.
[14:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Disabling seems bad because it becomes a guessing game.
[14:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> I wish I could remember how Eclipse handled this.
[14:50:57] <scott_gonzalez> Newer versions of Eclipse seemed to handle dependency management pretty well. As opposed to older versions which were horrible.
[14:51:45] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, gnarf, jzaefferer, another option I could implement is to create a "memory" of previous selected stuff. For example: 1) user deselects "widget", 2) a bunch of dependents are deselected, 3) if he selects "widget" back, the previous selected dependents are selected again.
[14:52:12] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'd rather have the dialog.
[14:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> It's jarring to just unselect a ton of stuff.
[14:52:31] <scott_gonzalez> The user might not even notice.
[14:52:49] <rxaviers> what about a temporary undo link?
[14:53:03] <rxaviers> the issue with dialog is one more click. But, up to you guys
[14:53:12] <scott_gonzalez> The click is important.
[14:53:13] <rxaviers> I can implement either one
[14:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> The user is doing something they probably aren't aware of.
[14:53:38] <scott_gonzalez> Expecting them to notice their mistake and click an undo link isn't good.
[14:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, we don't have UI loaded on the site right now.
[14:54:21] <scott_gonzalez> But we could easily add that.
[14:54:31] <rxaviers> ok
[15:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: If you're still around, I could use another grunt-jquery-content release :-)
[15:46:46] <_zoggy_> i dont care for the undo link. they could just reload the page
[15:47:32] <_zoggy_> the only time the user prob cares to know whats checked off and not.. is on doing custom builds
[15:48:11] <_zoggy_> it would be nice to have a tinyurl version of that link.. but the long ass url with all the custom settings mapped out is fine
[15:48:43] <_zoggy_> just need to add what is checked off or not, and prob add the version that the url was based off of.. in case you need to migrate their old settings
[15:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> they could just reload the page = horrible UX
[15:52:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'm also not sure if that's true that they can just reload the page if they're already picked/built a theme.
[15:53:34] <_zoggy_> well they could just check everything off and then uncheck what they dont want
[15:53:49] <_zoggy_> or vice versa
[15:54:16] <_zoggy_> you can provide a method to check everything off or uncheck everything off to reset the page state to make that easier
[15:54:30] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't solve the problem.
[15:54:39] <scott_gonzalez> The user comes in unchecks half a dozen widgets.
[15:54:54] <scott_gonzalez> Then they decide to uncheck position, because they don't know what it is.
[15:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> BAM. Half their choices are gone.
[15:55:05] <_zoggy_> you are trying to solve a problem that is: 'user has no clue what stuff is and wants to just click around'
[15:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> Did they notice?
[15:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not.
[15:55:10] <_zoggy_> yes
[15:55:17] <_zoggy_> and checking stuff back doesnt add anything back
[15:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what you're saying.
[15:55:45] <_zoggy_> but doing that logic i think is just as subvert
[15:55:46] <scott_gonzalez> Checking a component that has a dependency automatically adds its dependencies.
[15:56:07] <_zoggy_> right
[15:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that unchecking a dependency is automatically removing all dependents with no warning.
[15:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> There's no way we can expect the user to notice that.
[15:56:27] <_zoggy_> load up the page, check everything off, uncheck core.. check core back. what do you expect it to happen
[15:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> I expect an alert when I uncheck.
[15:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> If I agree to remove it, then almost everything goes away.
[15:57:09] <scott_gonzalez> If I then recheck it, only core gets added.
[15:57:11] <_zoggy_> you can add some visual clue that the stuff unchecked.. maybe flash bg color of the section and fade back to white
[15:57:13] <_zoggy_> right
[15:57:27] <_zoggy_> and per rxaviers suggestion earlier, he would want it to readd everything back
[15:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't help if what's being removed is off screen.
[15:57:58] <scott_gonzalez> And visual cues aren't enough anyway.
[15:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> We would have to include ARIA live regions or something similar.
[15:58:23] <scott_gonzalez> A dialog solves this problem for everyone.
[15:58:40] <scott_gonzalez> And it solves it in the most informative way.
[15:58:41] <_zoggy_> how about this as a plausible solution, you have your options and the ability to 'save' (saves to localStorage/cookie) and then you have a button to load saved data
[15:58:52] <_zoggy_> that way they can have the same buildout for whatever theme if they want
[15:59:07] <scott_gonzalez> You think users are actually going to save?
[15:59:14] <scott_gonzalez> That would be like 1% of users.
[15:59:33] <scott_gonzalez> It also doesn't solve the problem.
[15:59:44] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that there is absolutely no idication of what is about to happen.
[16:00:29] <_zoggy_> ok, personally i do agree that i think you should add stuff back.. if the 'toggle all' for that cat is checked
[16:00:39] <_zoggy_> as you can just rerun the logic on the current checkbox states
[16:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> We're not talking about toggle all.
[16:00:42] <_zoggy_> rather than the last click
[16:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> Toggle all is also broken, but that's a separate issue that I didn't complain about yet :-P
[16:01:45] <_zoggy_> ok so you wanna show a dialog box that does what? say what its about to uncheck/check?
[16:01:52] <_zoggy_> with a confirm button or not
[16:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[16:03:00] <_zoggy_> hmm maybe show the dependencies what widget/interaction/whatever is needed
[16:03:04] <scott_gonzalez> "Are you sure you want to remove core? The following components depend on it and will be removed: A, B, C, D."
[16:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> Listing dependencies per component is just noise.
[16:03:47] <scott_gonzalez> 99% of users won't care.
[16:05:29] <_zoggy_> ok well then i got nothin
[16:05:55] <_zoggy_> the ocd in me wants to mention, the ui.core options are not in ABC order
[16:06:13] <_zoggy_> interactions and widgets are
[16:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure where the order is coming from, but that's probably worth fixing :-)
[16:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> It's been in that order forever.
[16:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> Probably because they're in dependency order :-P
[16:08:14] <_zoggy_> and you dont put the cat section in the option name, like calling the widgets 'Draggable Widget' but you do put 'Effect' in for the effects
[16:08:42] <_zoggy_> and why even offer the ability to not include the effects core if its required... why not just make the build script smarter and auto include it if any effect is enabled
[16:09:20] <_zoggy_> oh i see its effects core which contains 2 effects
[16:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> Effects core has a lot of functionality.
[16:10:01] <_zoggy_> enough that it should be part of the ui.core ?
[16:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> no
[16:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> In fact, the size alone is a good reason for it to not be in ui.core.
[16:11:00] <_zoggy_> dunno if you want to add shift+click range ability to the check boxes
[16:11:11] <_zoggy_> not like theres that many of them.. but future growth ?
[16:11:26] <_zoggy_> im not saying put it in the actual core, just in the top ui.core option box
[16:11:41] <_zoggy_> as all the other 'cores' are up there
[16:12:16] <scott_gonzalez> There are only two cores. One spans all widgets and interactions and one is specific to effects.
[16:12:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather change the name Core to Utilities.
[16:13:55] <_zoggy_> gotcha
[16:19:13] <_zoggy_> .themeroller .application input, .themeroller .application select { vertical-align: top; }
[16:19:45] <_zoggy_> otherwise the input is not aligned with the other elements inline
[16:19:51] <_zoggy_> ff 15.0.1 at least
[16:20:41] <_zoggy_> and the texturePicker is 2px shorter than the inputs for me
[16:21:15] * _zoggy_ hides from scott_gonzalez
[16:22:36] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Can you make that change? ^
[16:33:43] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, just got back, sure!
[16:49:42] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, is toggle all broken? it seems to work for me
[16:49:57] <rxaviers> (just a side comment)
[16:50:33] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I just think it's weird that the checkbox stays on when you deselect a component.
[16:51:00] <rxaviers> ah! ok
[16:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> It's no more broken than what we've had for years though.
[16:51:09] <rxaviers> right, needs fix
[17:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: What is the name for words like "first", "second", "third"?
[17:03:04] <kswedberg> ordinals?
[17:03:16] <kswedberg> cardinals?
[17:03:21] <kswedberg> can't remember. hang on
[17:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, ordinals, thanks.
[17:04:09] <kswedberg> sure thing. :)
[17:08:47] <rxaviers> _zoggy_, scott_gonzalez, About "texturePicker is 2px shorter", adding 1px instead (height:17px) makes it closer to the inputs for me. Does it for you too? (you can use firebug to check themeroller.css line 301)
[17:12:21] <rxaviers> In chrome, 16px seems better. mm
[17:12:59] <_zoggy_> i used 18px and it aligned perfectly
[17:13:15] <_zoggy_> but thats firefox.. dunno if you just need box-sizing or what

[20:33:26] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, Do you know if widget doc name in jqueryui.com changed? (from widget.html -> jQuery.widget.html)
[20:34:52] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[20:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> It was named incorrectly before.
[20:35:19] <rxaviers> ah!
[20:35:34] <scott_gonzalez> It now also contains two entries.
[20:36:09] <rxaviers> why is it the only one starting with jQuery.*
[20:37:21] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's the only one that's not on jQuery.fn.
[20:37:55] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ vs. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[20:38:13] <rxaviers> ah thks
[20:38:47] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[20:39:09] <rxaviers> doc files are still based on selected components, right?
[20:39:24] <rxaviers> I mean, I should include jQuery.widget.html if widget is selected
[20:41:55] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ^
[20:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[20:42:26] <rxaviers> alright ;)
[20:42:27] <rxaviers> tks
[20:42:36] <scott_gonzalez> Honestly I'm fine if we just include all docs.
[20:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> I can't imagine someone complaining that there are too many docs included.
[20:43:14] <rxaviers> hehe
[20:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> But it does make sense to filter them since we filter everything else.
[20:43:26] <rxaviers> well, builder is already implemented to select those
[20:43:31] <rxaviers> so, it's no trouble
[20:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> ok
