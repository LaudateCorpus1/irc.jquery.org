[08:52:03] <jzaefferer> I might be a little late for the meeting 
[09:26:20] <jzaefferer> I guess I missed all of that
[09:26:41] <jzaefferer> as for button, while there is a little risk of redundancy, I think its still good for scott_gonzalez to review
[09:26:58] <jzaefferer> you can still see the last set of non-outdated comments from me
[09:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:37:35] <jzaefferer> hoping for arschmitz to land the jscs update soon; I just took another look and I'm not sure which, if any, commits are supposed to be squashed
[09:37:52] <jzaefferer> there's "Build: squash .jscsrc fixup" which is a strong candidate, but I'm not sure where that's supposed to go
[13:31:12] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: ill do it tonight
[13:31:17] <arschmitz> im traveling right now
[14:06:58] <paulong_> hello
