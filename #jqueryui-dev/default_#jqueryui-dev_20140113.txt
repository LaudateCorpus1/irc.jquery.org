[04:29:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[04:29:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Pong!
[04:29:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! Looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6697 ...
[04:30:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm wondering if it might not be easier to simply detach the three handlers everytime ...
[04:30:24] <arschmitz> it would certainly work
[04:30:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm certainly willing to take the code in there and put it in support, but I'm afraid doing it that way may require extensive testing to make sure the support test is correct for all supported browsers.
[04:31:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Here's the easy workaround: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/8399493
[04:32:31] <arschmitz> yeah it also creates a dep on support
[04:32:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[04:33:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and this way, there will be at most three superfluous bindings which keep getting reattached but never fire.
[04:33:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[04:33:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm inclined to go with the easy workaround ...
[04:34:00] <arschmitz> yeah transitions events are a bigger can of worms
[04:34:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... in fact, we should probably do the same thing for $.fn.animationComplete.
[04:34:13] <arschmitz> in general so for now lets go with the easy way
[04:34:43] <arschmitz> and then we can work on a better implementation of animationComplete with a timeout failsafe
[04:36:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: At $.fn.animationComplete we call the callback after unwinding the stack if we don't support css transitions.
[04:37:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right but remember the event may never come
[04:37:33] <arschmitz> so we need a timeout failsafe for that
[04:37:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right! That whole can of worms - of a different species!
[04:44:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[04:51:19] <agcolom> hi! I'm after an example of how we can use tabs and they look like tabs... 
[04:51:37] <agcolom> I'm sure arschmitz had one but it's not in the demos... 
[04:52:48] <agcolom> In the demos, we have lists and navbar for tabs, but not tabs that look like tabs... 
[04:55:10] <arschmitz> agcolom: is the closest http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/tabs/tabbed-content.php
[04:55:56] <agcolom> ok, so we basically get the functionality but not the "tabs" look, is that right?
[05:04:09] <arschmitz> agcolom: correct
[05:04:26] <arschmitz> agcolom: on mobile i think navbar is better for tabs
[05:05:02] <arschmitz> because it makes them full width which is better for small screens
[05:05:16] <agcolom> yes, it works well... but we should add the active style to the 1st tab when we get to the page
[05:05:38] <agcolom> what do you think?
[05:05:49] <arschmitz> agcolom: but you can do whatever you want with the tabs we dont actualy have any tabs css
[05:05:58] <arschmitz> agcolom: yes there is an open ticket for that 
[05:06:30] <agcolom> oh, ok. So I can have the example thne using navbar knowing that will be fixed?
[05:06:45] <agcolom> I'll do a PR now :-)
[05:07:02] <agcolom> (just to add an example in the docs).
[05:07:09] <arschmitz> agcolom: yes it will probably be fixed for 1.4.1
[05:07:40] <agcolom> brilliant! 
[05:07:56] <agcolom> And we don't need the script: $( "#tabs" ).tabs(); like ui does?
[05:08:43] <arschmitz> is this for api?
[05:08:47] <agcolom> yes
[05:09:04] <arschmitz> then this would fall under one of the widgets that no longer needs an iframe
[05:09:18] <agcolom> right...
[05:09:21] <arschmitz> and if your not using an iframe you should call it directly like ui does
[05:09:50] <arschmitz> agcolom: same goes for all other widgets
[05:10:31] <agcolom> the only thing is because it's a page, I think I need to use an iframe in this one, because this is how scott_gonzalez did other pages (as opposed to entries)? 
[05:11:03] <agcolom> so I'm looking at https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/pages/color-animation.md
[05:11:31] <arschmitz> agcolom: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries/tabs.xml
[05:11:36] <arschmitz> is what i would look at
[05:12:17] <agcolom> yes, I don't think I can do that as it is an html page and not an xml entry
[05:12:27] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ^ 
[05:12:54] <arschmitz> agcolom: maybe im missing something but you are working on the mobile tabs widget page right?
[05:13:00] <agcolom> yes
[05:13:15] <arschmitz> agcolom: in which case im pretty sure it should be an entry like the rest of the widgets
[05:13:24] <arschmitz> but scott_gonzalez would know for sure
[05:13:41] <agcolom> not according to a discussion you guys has 2/3 months ago :-)
[05:14:00] <arschmitz> oh that would be :)
[05:14:05] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/166
[05:14:39] <agcolom> so I thought also that it should be an entry but scott_gonzalez said no and pointed me to that discussion
[05:15:08] <arschmitz> agcolom: no your absolutly right
[05:15:39] <agcolom> ok... I'll have lunch now and back in a few mins... Let's see what happens :-)
[05:15:41] <arschmitz> i forgot that since its generic not a true entry it needs to be a page
[05:16:02] <agcolom> ok. So that's why I need an iframe for just this one...
[05:16:07] <agcolom> back in a few :-)

[05:59:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't believe https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6585 is happening ... at least not in Chrome and FF: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/6585.html
[05:59:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Did we have some specific browser where we were seeing that?
[06:00:02] <arschmitz> i was seeing it in chrome
[06:00:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll try to reproduce it on browserstack ...
[06:00:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: have you tried one jqm page to another?
[06:01:06] <arschmitz> but using ajax false for the first link
[06:04:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... OK ... so from what should be one instance of jqm to what should be another. OK. Can do.
[06:04:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can test that with a randomly generated number during pagecreate.
[06:04:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats where i recall seeing it
[06:04:45] <arschmitz> easier
[06:04:51] <arschmitz> check how many pages are in dom
[06:04:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[06:05:02] <arschmitz> should only be one if its working right
[06:08:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looking clean in both Chrome and FF.
[06:08:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmmm weird i dont think we have made any changes let me check this out real quick
[06:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom arschmitz: There's nothing special about pages or entries that makes one need or not need an iframe.
[06:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> Pages are just HTML, there's no special restrictions in place.
[06:13:14] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok yeah my question was about page vs entry for mobile tabs page
[06:13:33] <arschmitz> it should be a page though right?
[06:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> We use iframes because of loading the libraries.
[06:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[06:14:00] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: can I add code example that then generates the iframe automatically like we do for entries? (the final example)
[06:15:38] <agcolom> so this is what I did: https://github.com/agcolom/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/9e205b34f6601488c3f26f0be11f3d60bbe2d544
[06:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Yes, just use the same markup that the XSLT generates.
[06:15:49] <agcolom> ok... 
[06:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> This is the script: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/themes/jquery/js/main.js#L69
[06:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> And here's the XSLT: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/master/tasks/jquery-xml/entries2html-base.xsl#L615
[06:16:53] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, great, thanks! arschmitz: so I will be changing my PR for that... 
[06:18:26] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: one thing about not using iframes like mobile does now
[06:18:58] <arschmitz> is we will need to use a custom build or add some code to disable autoinit
[06:19:20] <arschmitz> because jqm will try to take over the whole page
[06:19:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about turning off autoInitializePage on mobileinit?
[06:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> So disable autoinit. That code wouldn't show up in the example anyway.
[06:20:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: "or add some code to disable autoinit"
[06:20:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If we're using pages rather than entries we can do that.
[06:20:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. Sorry!
[06:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> Can you make it so that it literally does nothing but trigger mobileinit?
[06:23:33] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I don't think that's possible. The init IIFE triggers that and then adds classes ui-mobile and ui-mobile-rendering to <html> to prevent FOUC.
[06:24:27] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, the only way around might be a custom build that does not include it.
[06:26:18] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: _|Nix|_: im sure i can make it do what we need but its not supported by default
[06:26:51] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well do whatever makes sense.
[06:50:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: _|Nix|_: i think we can just set gradeA to false 
[06:53:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Riiight! Good idea! It returns from init right after checking that.
[06:53:31] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:53:42] <arschmitz> looks like no classes are added or anything if we do that
[06:53:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it's perfect.
[06:54:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, we may run into problems because some CSS rules apply only if ui-mobile is set on HTML.
[06:54:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: uGoMobi used the top-level classes for added specificity.
[06:54:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we can fix that if it comes up
[06:55:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: $( "html" ).addclass( "ui-mobile" );
[06:55:44] <uGoMobi> right
[06:55:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm a little cautious to say that's the solution because I seem to recall that making the whole page disappear, lemme double-check.
[06:56:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think that's class ui-mobile-rendering
[06:56:39] <uGoMobi> or something like that
[06:57:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I thought so too, but for some reason it was invisible even without it. I hope I remember wrong.
[06:57:22] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing should be dependent on a ui-mobile class existing on <html>.
[06:57:33] <scott_gonzalez> If any widgets work that way, they need to be updated.
[06:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise they won't work properly as standalone widgets.
[06:59:27] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/agcolom/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/d75a6daa344d661bc5cc44705365810d57764c3f 
[06:59:38] <uGoMobi> ah right, it isn't a problem
[06:59:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I think we're good. A quick scan reveals only one possible problem: css/structure/jquery.mobile.forms.fieldcontain.css
[06:59:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^
[06:59:58] <_|Nix|_> Otherwise it's all in core and transition.
[07:00:16] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: is that what you were saying I should do for that particular case?
[07:00:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I used it in the theme CSS for inheritance, but for standalone widgets you have to set a theme anyway
[07:00:31] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: There should not be CDATA in there.
[07:00:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK. That's good then.
[07:00:43] <agcolom> ok... I'll remove it
[07:00:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... well aside from that fieldcontain thing ...
[07:01:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I see that
[07:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'd also be cautious of trying to duplicate the content exactly, as opposed to just using the proper classes.
[07:01:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we also have just .ui-fieldcontain as selector
[07:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> This can easily get out of sync with the generated examples if we change the XSLT.
[07:02:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so I guess we're cool, right?
[07:02:23] <uGoMobi> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/bNG1mNio
[07:02:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[07:02:53] <uGoMobi> that wasn't added in 1.4
[07:03:14] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: re: I'd also be cautious of trying to duplicate the content exactly, as opposed to just using the proper classes. (was that for me?)
[07:03:31] <agcolom> If it is, I think I see what you mean and I agree
[07:03:41] <agcolom> I didn't see there was a class for that... 
[07:04:24] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: That's why I linked to the JS first.
[07:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> Since that shows the classes that matter.
[07:05:43] <agcolom> right... I saw the one about syntax highlighter and assumed it was the only one... Silly me ;-)
[07:06:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: apparently navbar has no theme option
[07:08:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, navbars always inherit the theme from the toolbar
[07:08:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: unless its not in a toolbar
[07:08:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and if you use theme outside toolbar....
[07:08:35] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:08:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: makes it broken compared to others
[07:08:52] <uGoMobi> they inherit from the container or page
[07:08:59] <arschmitz> if you use standalone
[07:09:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's not supported yet
[07:09:23] <arschmitz> because if there is no toolbar or page or pagecontainer you cant set it without setting a class on a parrent
[07:09:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we didn't review the navbar widget
[07:09:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: navbar is supported outside page though
[07:09:54] <uGoMobi> did we document that?
[07:10:03] <arschmitz> yup 
[07:10:26] <uGoMobi> we didn't make any change and did not even look into the widget
[07:10:45] <uGoMobi> so we shouldn't have assumed that it will work
[07:12:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it had to for toolbars
[07:12:11] <arschmitz> it was made to
[07:12:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when they are used with toolbars it's not a problem
[07:12:34] <arschmitz> and we have never said you cant use navbars outside toolbars
[07:12:38] <uGoMobi> they work outside pages, inside toolbars
[07:12:47] <arschmitz> we were never that specific
[07:13:27] <uGoMobi> well, before 1.4 we didn't officially support any widget outside page
[07:13:52] <uGoMobi> and for 1.4 we were specific about the ones that now do work outside pages
[07:14:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't think it's a big problem though
[07:15:09] <arschmitz> its easy enough to work around
[07:15:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you can just add theme class to the navbar if you use it outside page without toolbar
[07:15:15] <arschmitz> but it is inconsistant
[07:15:23] <uGoMobi> true
[07:16:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we have navbar on the roadmap for 1.5
[07:16:31] <arschmitz> yup
[07:17:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: besides the missing option theme, users would also like to be able to set a theme for each button
[07:17:34] <uGoMobi> that's something we don't support either
[07:26:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6925: I think we may want a blacklist of element types that do not trigger close, akin to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/dfc5d32aad67dba223c343cf4fbde26bbaa20911/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L20
[07:27:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: I've just fixed the issue by checking that the swipe event comes from area (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/dfc5d32aad67dba223c343cf4fbde26bbaa20911/js/widgets/panel.js#L231) but I realized that might be too strict - what if the panel contains a <p>?
[07:29:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in 1.3 we just said you cant use a slider in a panel with swipe close
[07:29:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it will happen with all text that you try to select by clicking and dragging the mouse
[07:30:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, I knew we discussed this before, just couldn't remember what it was exactly :)
[07:30:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so is that bug a wontfix?
[07:30:32] <arschmitz> you cant realistically have it both ways have swipe events from mouse and have interaction with in the panel in a swipe like manner
[07:30:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the use can turn off swipe to close
[07:30:48] <_|Nix|_> Actually, we might be able to help out a little.
[07:30:56] <_|Nix|_> We should not close if the default on the swipe is prevented.
[07:31:12] <_|Nix|_> Then the user can bind to the individual exposed elements and prevent default.
[07:31:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: might considered ignoring inputs at least though
[07:31:26] <_|Nix|_> Let them figure out how to make the two be friends.
[07:31:36] <uGoMobi> with CSS you can set that you can't select text, but you won't know that when you try to select it, so the panel will close anyway
[07:31:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: id be fine with that
[07:31:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: With heeding a prevented default?
[07:32:03] <arschmitz> yes
[07:32:14] <_|Nix|_> OK. I think that should give devs the tools they need.
[07:32:31] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[07:37:45] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! The panel gets a different swipeleft event than the input! It's not the input even bubbling?!
[07:47:33] <_|Nix|_> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1141
[07:47:40] <_|Nix|_> OK - I'm stumped :()
[07:49:48] <_|Nix|_> Here it is with preventDefault/isDefaultPrevented: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1142
[07:50:17] <_|Nix|_> Why is it two different events?
[07:50:42] <_|Nix|_> The target is certainly the same ...
[07:59:42] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I hope it's all ok now... will be offline going home... 
[08:02:03] <_|Nix|_> OK ... this is weird ... if I swipe on the panel itself, only one event is triggered, however, if I trigger on the input inside the panel, two events are triggered.
[08:04:38] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I need to figure out this event weirdness ...

[13:42:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You've found my problem? With the swipe event?
[13:42:32] <arschmitz> '
[13:42:35] <arschmitz> yes
[13:42:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Please! Do teel!
[13:42:48] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[13:42:49] <_|Nix|_> Tell
[13:42:58] <arschmitz> lol
[13:42:58] <_|Nix|_> And I don't mean William, either :)
[13:43:26] <arschmitz> this line got botched
[13:43:31] <arschmitz> it should be 2 lines
[13:43:38] <arschmitz> emitted = false;
[13:43:50] <arschmitz> $.event.specil.....
[13:44:12] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/events/touch.js#L198
[13:45:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see ...
[13:45:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, because handleSwipe can return true as well.
[13:46:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But wait, the point of handleSwipe is to return whether the event was emitted.
[13:47:06] <arschmitz> hmmm right ok
[13:47:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so what you're saying is that emitted should be set to false, no matter what handleSwipe returns?
[13:47:11] <arschmitz> then after that
[13:47:17] <arschmitz> no
[13:47:38] <arschmitz> let me look again real quick
[13:48:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: BTW: The double emission only happens if the target is an input. If I stick a <p> inside a panel and trigger swipe with the <p> as the target, it does not get double-triggered.
[13:51:41] <arschmitz> hmmm ok
[13:51:47] <arschmitz> ill take another look
[13:51:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but related to the events
[13:54:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... weird ... it does indeed appear that triggerCustomEvent is always called twice.
[13:55:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im re working animationComplete
[13:55:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[13:55:16] <arschmitz> to have a fallback always select the proper event
[13:55:24] <arschmitz> and work for transition or animation
[13:55:32] <_|Nix|_> +1
[13:55:33] <arschmitz> so it will fix all those issues
[13:56:21] <arschmitz> it will take two new options type and fallbackTime
[13:56:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird ... triggerCustomEvent is called twice, but only one event ever reaches the document ...
[13:57:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah 
[13:57:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, yeah ... I guess that's the best we can do, but I'm not sure what you can pass to fallbackTime ... I mean, from an app, you can certainly know the value the transition is supposed to take, but the framework can never know that.
[13:57:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there is no other choice
[13:57:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I agree.
[13:57:45] <arschmitz> because you have no gurantee that event will EVER happen
[13:57:50] <arschmitz> leaving you in a broken state
[13:58:09] <arschmitz> so you pick a time that should always be enough and hope for the best more or less
[13:58:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, then we cannot make use of the function from the framework anymore than we can now.
[13:58:23] <arschmitz> why not?
[13:58:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I guess if we pick, like, 2 seconds ...
[13:58:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That should be reasonable.
[13:58:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was thinking 1 second but the exact time is debateable
[13:59:16] <arschmitz> the fact is if close starts and does not finish we need to finish it or it will be broken
[13:59:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and, unfortunately, rather arbitrary :/ Basically, we're saying "2 seconds ought to be enough for any transition/animation/whatever".
[13:59:35] <arschmitz> yup
[14:00:07] <arschmitz> the main case for this is scrolling on ios
[14:00:24] <arschmitz> so we need to make sure the timeout is longer then you could spend scrolling
[14:00:39] <arschmitz> on an ipad that might be a while lol
[14:00:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, eh?
[14:01:09] <arschmitz> oh but wait no
[14:01:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and in a way that's no indication either, because the event might get triggered after JS execution is resumed, even though the timeout is nearly up.
[14:01:19] <arschmitz> we dont care how long the scroll takes
[14:01:39] <arschmitz> because the close animation happens durring scroll
[14:01:45] <arschmitz> just the event does not
[14:01:56] <arschmitz> but a timeout will always happen
[14:02:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly. Time keeps on ticking even while JS is suspended.
[14:02:46] <arschmitz> so the only concern is taking longer then the animation should so we dont have a flicker in the close animation
[14:04:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Does the fact that the end-of-animation handler fails to get called cause the flicker?
[14:05:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no
[14:06:02] <arschmitz> if complete is called to soon by the timeout
[14:06:11] <arschmitz> the panel will just disappear in the middle of the animation
[14:06:54] <arschmitz> basicly the animation what ever one it is would suddenly go to the end state
[14:06:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, and scrolling the page will shift weight in favour of the timeout, because time keeps on ticking while you scroll, so if you scroll enough, the next frame is likely to be the timeout handler.
[14:07:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But so what, if the animation itself is not suspended during scrolling?
[14:07:24] <arschmitz> no scrolling wont effect because the animation runs and completes durring scrolling
[14:07:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, because it's not a JS animation.
[14:07:36] <arschmitz> we just dont get the event
[14:07:57] <arschmitz> so this says if its been more then 2 seconds and no event has come just complete
[14:08:16] <arschmitz> so this would only happen on like crazy slow device
[14:08:34] <arschmitz> which something that slow would likely not support the animation in the first place
[14:09:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wow! Really? If JS is suspended while the animation completes, it doesn't even queue the event? Wow! Terrible! Terrible!
[14:09:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes thats the whole problem
[14:09:30] <arschmitz> thats why we need the timeout
[14:09:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But it sure as heck queues the timeout :/ St00pid WK.
[14:10:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yea
[14:12:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, Chrome ain't 100% reliable at emitting the animation end event either (IIRC), so I guess it's not all iOS all the time.
[14:12:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: either way this provides a fall back so things at least are not broken
[14:13:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure. It'd be interesting to track these things somehow ...
[14:13:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: An inocuous console.log would be nice, but I guess we can't have console.logs in our code :/
[14:16:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looking at the swipe event, I'm noticing that it binds to touchStartEvent like three times ... that might explain the multiple events, because there are three closures containing "emitted".
[14:17:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait, no, strike that. Put the console.log in the wrong place.
[14:18:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it still happens multiple times ... I'll track down from whence.

[14:45:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait, no :/ _bindSwipeEvents only gets called once, but the handlers get attached to both the panel and the modal. That's why two event handlers get attached ... *sigh* ...
[14:51:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I think I know what's going on. setup gets called once for each element to which a swipeleft handler gets attached. However, the swipeleft event happens on another element altogether - the input, or the p or whatever element. So, since setup got called twice, once for the panel and once for the modal, one event is getting triggered for each - but with the same target.
[14:52:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if set
[14:53:18] <arschmitz> sorry fighting my son for the keyboard :)
[14:53:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I thought events worked in such a way that a request for a handler to be attached to event X causes setup to be called, but all subsequent handlers do not cause setup to be called.
[14:53:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NP.
[14:53:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: May the best man win!
[14:54:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I suppose it's up to the special event implementation whether it ignores subsequent calls to setup or not.
[14:55:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: setup: Do something when the first event handler is bound to a particular element.More explicitly: do something when an event handler is bound to a particular element, but only if there are not currently any event handlers bound. This may occur in two scenarios: 1) either the very first time that event is bound to that element, or 2) the next time that event is bound to that element, after all p
[14:55:43] <arschmitz> revious handlers for that event have been unbound from that element.
[14:57:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: add: Do something each time an event handler is bound to a particular element.

[15:24:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's kinda weird ... I attach a swipeleft handler to the document just to see if the events bubble, and the panel attaches its two swipeleft handlers. The touch events that get processed into a swipe event bubble from the panel (because that's where I happen to be swiping) to the document, so two swipe events get generated - one because the panel had a swipe handler attached, and one because the document had a swipe handler attached
[15:24:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The interesting thing is that the swipe event that gets generated because the panel attaches a swipeleft handler does not seem to bubble up to the document so that my for-debugging-purposes handler can receive and report it.

[15:33:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, it's because I wasn't attaching the for-debugging-purposes handler in a delegated fashion. I attached it as $.mobile.document.on( "swipeleft", "*", ... ) and all's well.
[15:34:34] <_|Nix|_> ... if you can say that ... it's now receiving four swipeleft events :)

[16:56:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, it doesn't bubble because it's "fired" via jQuery.event.dispatch(), rather than .trigger()
[16:59:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, even if we were to use trigger, thus causing the events to bubble, we'd still have the problem that the constituent mouse events also bubble, so a series of mouse events on the input would be processed into a swipe and triggered on the input, but the same mouse events would also be processed into a swipe event at the panel level.
[17:02:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, the panel would receive the swipe event from the input and would find that its default has been prevented. Dandy! But then it would receive the swipe event generated for the panel's own handler, and that's a different swipe event, so its default would not be prevented.
[17:04:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm starting to think that swipe should be the kind of event I thought it was - namely, if you attach a swipe handler to /any/ element, it attaches the mouse handlers to the document once, and then never again until all handlers to all elements have been removed.
[17:05:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, for any series of mouse movements, exactly one swipe event is generated and then it bubbles all the way to the document.
[17:07:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The problem is that, once the mouse handlers are attached, and they get triggered, how do you know that the event on which they got triggered was among those that are supposed to have swipe handlers attached?
[17:07:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's not like you can keep a list of elements every time someone calls setup, and then, for each mouse* event, check whether event.target is in that list - or can you?
[17:08:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I meant, create a list of elements and add an element every time someone calls setup, and then check if, for any mouse* event, the event.target is in that list.
[17:09:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im going to talk to kris and scott about this tomorrow
[17:09:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they have a lot more experience with the special events api
[17:09:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can also see via jQuery._data( element, "events" ) whether any given element has a swipe* handler attached.
[17:10:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hold on. This may be possible if we use this jQuery._data API.
[17:10:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then we can do this: $( document ).on( "mouseup", function( event ) { if ( jQuery._data( event.target, "events" ).swipeleft ) { maybe trigger swipeleft } );
[17:11:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course, we'd be depending on a jQuery private API.
[17:12:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we would have to talk to the core guys about that
[17:12:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But anyway - yeah, good idea to talk to them.
[17:12:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, of course.
[17:13:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Either way, I think the goal is that, for any sequence of mouse events, exactly one swipe event should be generated and bubbled.
[17:13:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes that makes sense
[17:13:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Event though multiple swipe handlers may be attached along the list of parents.
[17:13:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there have been several open tickets over time about different issues with swipe events bubbling
[17:14:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or not bubbling.
[17:14:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think events triggered via jQuery.event.dispatch() do not bubble.
[17:14:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm not sure if this is accurate: Any one mouse event should participate in the calculation of exactly one swipe event.
[17:15:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or, rather, at most one swipe event.
[17:15:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Anyhoo ... I think I'm'na hit the hay ...
