[14:06:33] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: how do I use grunt to run the unit tests? I've just been using browser directly which stops me from certain things due to $.ajax security apparently
[14:06:44] <Dave_Stein> kborchers ^ you would know too I think :)

[14:28:47] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: hi
[14:29:02] <mikesherov> I use localhost to runt the test suite in browser
[14:29:25] <mikesherov> it can't be from file://
[14:29:34] <mikesherov> it's gotta be from a local web server
[14:37:41] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: ah dur makes sense i gotta set one up. first got git and eveyrthing installed today since my hd crashed
[14:37:55] <mikesherov> WAMP is pretty good
[14:38:01] <Dave_Stein> yeah that's what i had before
[14:38:14] <Dave_Stein> you see im almost done getting units green?
[14:38:32] <Dave_Stein> i just need to talk to scott_gonzalez about the 3 that are red ( aside from the ones that SHOLD turn green on local server )
[14:38:51] <Dave_Stein> hopefully i can get to another widget this week

[14:39:42] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: you're so close on the test suite now!
[14:39:50] <Dave_Stein> indeed
[14:39:57] <Dave_Stein> i did copy paste snap tho god that code is horror
[14:40:09] <mikesherov> You should merge master in
[14:40:11] <Dave_Stein> did NOT want to refactor for a backcompat like that
[14:40:53] <mikesherov> jquery.simulate.js is now it's own first class project, and I've made some enhancements to that and changed a few unit tests today
[14:41:09] <Dave_Stein> yeah i saw
[14:41:11] <mikesherov> or you can wait for someone with a bit more git fu to do it
[14:41:26] <Dave_Stein> isnt it just a one liner like git merge origin master while sitting in my branch
[14:41:48] <mikesherov> um
[14:41:51] <mikesherov> maybe?
[14:41:57] <Dave_Stein> haha
[14:42:05] <mikesherov> I usually have jquery/jquery-ui set to upstream
[14:42:09] <Dave_Stein> ill use google and try not to fuck up all our hard work ;)
[14:42:30] <mikesherov> so I do git checkout master && git pull upstream master && git checkout interactions && git merge master
[14:43:01] <Dave_Stein> ah yes so i can just replace the word upstream with origin for me
[14:43:01] <mikesherov> or you can do git merge upstream master tooâ€¦ I think 
[14:43:05] <Dave_Stein> i didnt do anything special for rmeote
[14:43:06] <mikesherov> I like to do it all from local
[14:43:40] <Dave_Stein> or i can downoad tortoisegit but ill try what you said
[14:43:41] <Dave_Stein> :)
[14:43:48] <mikesherov> cool
[14:43:52] <Dave_Stein> in meantime im watching six feet under with  fiance
[14:43:55] <mikesherov> I'm a CLI guy for git
[14:43:58] <mikesherov> enjoy!
[15:19:07] <Dave_Stein> oh i lied xampp is what i use
