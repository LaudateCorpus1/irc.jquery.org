[04:39:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Could you please review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7226? It's only demos, so it should be OK.
[04:39:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It pre-renders the collapsibles in the left-side menu.
[04:39:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure, will look at in a minute
[04:39:37] <uGoMobi> cool
[04:40:23] <uGoMobi> there are quite a lot collapsibles in there so that's a good idea
[04:40:28] <_|Nix|_> Exactly.
[04:40:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and pre-rendering them removes a lot of DOM manip from the page startup.
[04:42:13] <uGoMobi> yeah
[04:42:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Our meeting is an hour earlier this week, right?
[04:42:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, that's correct
[04:42:54] <_|Nix|_> Cool! Just checking ...
[04:43:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: until end of the month
[04:44:00] <_|Nix|_> Riiiight ... gotta remember that ...
[04:45:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: or use Google Agenda where you can use timezones :)

[05:59:35] <agcolom> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: so the US changed time this weekend (I think) so that means our meetings are 1h earlier than normal for us until we change also on the 30th March

[08:07:17] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi arschmitz: I'm in the process of updating a project from 1.4.0 to 1.4.2. Looks like several issues are introduced by lack of classes that the framework used to add, like "ui-content" on data-role="content" or "ui-header" on data-role="header". I don't see anything related in the changelog for 1.4.2.
[08:07:55] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: those should still be added in 1.4.2
[08:08:02] <arschmitz> if they are not thats a bug
[08:08:21] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: data-role="content" has been deprecated, but it should still work in 1.4.2
[08:09:10] <jzaefferer> Okay, thanks. I'll look into reporting that properly
[08:09:13] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: do you have a test page its still working on our standard jsbin test page
[08:09:23] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1/edit
[08:09:28] <jzaefferer> That's what I need to put together
[08:09:58] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: cool just let me know if you need anything 
[08:11:50] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: do you do any testing with custom builds?
[08:12:08] <arschmitz> yeah i just built an app with one last week
[08:13:26] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: though i didnt use data-roles at all called everything directly
[08:13:50] <jzaefferer> okay.
[08:13:52] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: when you get a sec let me know what components your using 
[08:14:00] <arschmitz> for the custom build
[08:14:10] <jzaefferer> I just noticed that my custom download didn't include init, that's likely the issue. Most stuff on my test page is initialized manually
[08:14:26] <jzaefferer> I'm pretty sure I clicked on "Select all" for Core
[08:15:42] <jzaefferer> Also weird that "Toolbar: Fixed" is included twice, once after Filterable-widgetlink, once at the end
[08:16:08] <arschmitz> hmm yeah something weird is going on there
[08:16:30] <jzaefferer> Yeah, init gets unchecked when selecting something else further down
[08:16:59] <jzaefferer> Really need to migrate to a shared codebase here...
[08:17:20] <arschmitz> yup
[08:17:34] <arschmitz> as soon as ui builder can handle css we are going to
[08:20:05] <jzaefferer> ah, right
[08:20:32] <jzaefferer> rxaviers scott_gonzalez: where were we on DB and CSS? We wanted to add support for special comments ala Mobile, right?
[08:22:34] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi closed issue #7214: 1.4.2 Demos: Transition page not working (404 not found) 02http://git.io/gp4LEg
[08:24:05] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: yes
[08:24:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think that's implemented yet.
[08:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> Since we're not handling it in jquery-ui yet.
[08:24:53] <arschmitz> if i recall from san diego rxaviers was going to wait to work on that for 1.12
[08:26:25] <rxaviers> hey guys.. yeap, that's a requisite for mobile+ui merge on DB
[08:26:36] <uGoMobi> hey rxaviers 
[08:28:09] <uGoMobi> rxaviers: but that does not mean it has to wait until 2.0, right?
[08:28:27] <rxaviers> no no, I mean mobile+ui using the same DB
[08:28:37] <rxaviers> Download Builder
[08:28:46] <uGoMobi> right
[08:29:09] <uGoMobi> we were hoping to use UI's DB already for Mobile 1.5
[08:29:20] <rxaviers> ok. when is that due to?
[08:29:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: like 4ish months right
[08:29:46] <uGoMobi> we were planning on half yearly releases
[08:30:00] <arschmitz> 'yeah and its been about 2 months already
[08:30:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, something like that
[08:30:23] <rxaviers> ~June then?
[08:30:39] <arschmitz> rxaviers: give or take there is nothing solid
[08:30:39] <jzaefferer> I wouldn't want to add more blockers to 1.11, but since we're still not done with the release process, we might be able to get that in. Will delay Globalize, but 1.11 not so much hopefully. What do you think rxaviers?
[08:30:44] <uGoMobi> rxaviers: yes you could also say it like that ;-)
[08:32:29] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, when is tj_vantoll's datepicker going/planned to land? 1.12?
[08:32:53] <uGoMobi> I see it on the roadmap for 1.13
[08:32:59] <uGoMobi> rxaviers: ^^
[08:33:05] <rxaviers> ah gotcha
[08:33:05] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: when its done, we'll just move it into whatever release is closest
[08:33:19] <jzaefferer> that's not a blocker, but of course it should be done sooner than later ;)
[08:33:31] <rxaviers> I remember TJ saying he expected to boost its development in ~ 3 months
[08:33:37] <rxaviers> expects*
[08:34:20] <jzaefferer> yeah, probably when he's done with his book
[08:34:22] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, well, I definitely could prioritize this CSS work on DB. But, I don't understand why you would like to get it done on 1.11?
[08:34:34] <jzaefferer> since the date module is mostly done, I'm not worrying too much about that
[08:34:52] <rxaviers> ok
[08:35:30] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: well, we should start using that in UI as well to make sure it works there and for Mobile. If that lines up with 1.11, all the better
[08:35:51] <rxaviers> arschmitz, uGoMobi, thanks (re: 1.5 due date)
[08:36:27] <uGoMobi> rxaviers: np, thanks for working on making the DB work for Mobile :)
[08:36:51] <rxaviers>  /o\
[08:37:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ok, will start working on it to get a better sight
[08:37:49] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: a prototype would be good, to get an idea how much work this actually is
[08:38:41] <rxaviers> absolutely
[08:39:28] <rxaviers> will probably start posting comments in here soon https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/178
[08:39:37] <rxaviers> soon = this week
[08:45:26] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:49:50] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: fyi you're right that I plan on getting back on datepicker in about 2 more months. We're aiming for 1.12 but it might end up being 1.13.
[08:50:09] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, thanks for letting me know ;)

[13:25:20] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz: re:https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/282 should these methods be documented? 
[13:26:10] <arschmitz> agcolom: yes they should be
[13:26:23] <arschmitz> but you need to note they are part of the fixedToolbar extension
[13:26:26] <arschmitz> not the base widget
[13:26:39] <agcolom> right. sure. Thank you
[13:26:49] <arschmitz> no problem
[13:36:29] <agcolom> arschmitz: does that mean the code example should not be $( ".selector" ).toolbar( "toggle" ); 
[13:36:40] <agcolom> but $( ".selector" ).fixedtoolbar( "toggle" ); ?
[13:38:03] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: No.
[13:38:12] <agcolom> $( ".selector" ).toolbar( "toggle" ); is good?
[13:38:26] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The fixed toolbar is an extension of toolbar, but it simply modifies the existing toolbar plugin's behaviour.
[13:38:50] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, .toolbar( "toggle" ) is good.
[13:38:56] <agcolom> great! Thanks
[13:39:18] <agcolom> and I add a warning saying "This method is part of the fixedToolbar extension."
[13:39:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: A warning?
[13:39:40] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I think that might be a bit drastic.
[13:39:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Maybe we should have a note class.
[13:40:05] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I've added blurbs related to the fact that something is provided by an extension in other places.
[13:40:09] * _|Nix|_ go check where
[13:40:23] <agcolom> I was thinking a note with a warning div (yellow) but not say warning
[13:40:40] <agcolom> just so that it attracts the eye of the reader
[13:40:52] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Look at entries/textinput.xml
[13:41:01] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK, that's not bad, I guess.
[13:41:16] <agcolom> I'm doing a screenshot...
[13:41:27] <_|Nix|_> Wow, there's actually quite a bit ...
[13:41:44] <_|Nix|_> If you have a command line into the API docs repo, you can do this: grep -niH 'provided by' entries/*xml
[13:42:12] <_|Nix|_> ... and it'll show you all the places where I've said "This option is provided by the ??? extension.
[13:43:39] <agcolom> http://f.cl.ly/items/473n3Y2E2s383z3D1l2m/toggle.tiff
[13:44:10] <agcolom> ok, looking at textinput...
[13:45:11] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: ok, I'll do that then 
[13:46:05] <agcolom> "This method is provided by the fixedtoolbar extension."
[13:46:54] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Cool!
