[06:42:18] <jq-jenkins> k_borchers: Menu: Remove the isScrolling check which nolonger seems necessary.
[07:38:42] <scott_gonzalez> miketaylr: yt?
[08:43:23] <jzaefferer> kborchers: can you merge master into selectmenu when you make changes that affect selectmenu?
[08:44:23] <kborchers> sure can ... didn't know if that would mess with fnagel which is why is just commented. i'll do it now
[08:49:16] <jzaefferer> that's a valid point, though there shouldn't be a reason against merging master into any of our branches
[08:50:38] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] kborchers pushed 1 new commit to selectmenu: http://git.io/qapARw
[08:50:38] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/selectmenu] Merge branch 'master' into selectmenu - kborchers
[08:51:22] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ^
[08:54:57] <kborchers> jzaefferer: oh, i just saw the issue of selecting the first item in selectmenu that feliz is talking about ... now to figure out how to fix it ;)
[08:55:55] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
