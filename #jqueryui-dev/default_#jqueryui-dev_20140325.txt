[09:19:34] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: is there a demo for jQuery Mobile somewhere showing theming without the init module? Something that tells me what classes I have to add manually to get page theming. My sample app is on 1.2 and the migration guide isn't of much help to me.
[09:30:08] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: so like not for widgets you just want to apply the page theme classes manually to get the page look without pages?
