[04:32:42] <ckaymowski_> Hi there! I'm interested in working on some tickets of jquery.ui. I just read the guide on how to submit a fix (the easy way) on git hub. Is there a "difficult" way where i can use the git clone on my computer or do i have to use github for that?
[08:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf, kborchers: we're going to cancel today's meeting
[08:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> Jörn and I will both be busy and I'm not sure about Richard (he's doing a training today)
[08:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> plus we don't really have much to discuss
[08:47:40] <kborchers> ok, i was gonna have to cut out early for an interview anyway. thanks for the heads up
[08:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> Can one of you just leave a message in #jquery-meeting in about 15 min letting people know?
[08:48:43] <kborchers> i will if it's not muted ;)
[08:49:11] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks. If it is, just ask ajpiano or danheberden to unmute
[08:49:20] <kborchers> ok
[13:04:18] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers, what interview?
[13:23:42] <jzaefferer> so clarkbox, on TestSwarm, my perspective: we'd like to use that as part of continous integration
[13:23:56] <clarkbox> yes
[13:23:57] <jzaefferer> supposed to test jQuery Core, UI, Mobile, QUnit and official plugins
[13:24:16] <jzaefferer> dunno about core, they don't seem to care much about the results, or are annoyed by Jenkins always failing
[13:24:34] <clarkbox> well it seems to be working (not failing) for the most part now
[13:24:40] <jzaefferer> jQuery Mobile is running their own Jenkins behind some corporate firewall (at least last I checked), using Selenium to run their units
[13:24:46] <jzaefferer> so no real interest there either
[13:24:47] <clarkbox> just seems to be some issues with testswarm...
[13:25:00] <jzaefferer> jQuery UI is kind of drowning, to many battle fronts
[13:25:24] <clarkbox> if a client is closed mid test, that test is not made available for other clients
[13:25:33] <jzaefferer> so if you could help out figure out the remaining testswarm issues, maybe get some help from gnarf or kborchers on that, would help a lot
[13:25:45] <jzaefferer> yeah, that's a big problem
[13:26:01] <clarkbox> is testswarm maintained?
[13:26:05] <clarkbox> i guess thats on us?
[13:26:17] <jzaefferer> there's still Justin who's interested in improving the Jenkins-TestSwarm plugin, gonna try and talk with him on Friday
[13:26:24] <jzaefferer> timezone diff is delaying that a lot...
[13:26:40] <jzaefferer> yeah, no one is taking care of that; krinkle merges the useragent PRs, that's about it
[13:27:15] <clarkbox> that seems problematic... hard to stick with something that is not maintained
[13:29:10] <jzaefferer> needs more commitment from all our teams who should be using it...
[13:29:41] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: any idea what the state of mobile browser support is on browserstack?
[13:29:49] <clarkbox> ya. it would be nice to have everyone using the same shit
[13:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: All I know is that they're actively working on it. I can ping them for a estimated date.
[13:31:27] <jzaefferer> that would surely help get Mobile on board :-)
[13:31:42] <jzaefferer> though afaik they just test Firefox and Chrome right now
[13:31:47] <jzaefferer> TestSwarm can do that, too
[13:32:44] <scott_gonzalez> I can likely help with TestSwarm after the plugins site is done.
[13:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> But probably only a few hours per week.
[13:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> I really need to get back to focusing on UI.

[13:59:10] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[14:32:47] <kborchers> jzaefferer: u still around?
[14:38:01] <jzaefferer> kborchers: kind of
[16:09:24] <clarkbox> i think popup() could be a little more dynamic....
[16:09:47] <clarkbox> in the case the trigger option has multiple matches
[16:10:24] <clarkbox> i can get a popup on multiple triggers
[16:10:35] <clarkbox> but the position is always on the first trigger
[16:11:25] <clarkbox> im thinking that within the open function, the event.target could be used for the of option of position
[16:12:44] <clarkbox> does that sound reasonable?
