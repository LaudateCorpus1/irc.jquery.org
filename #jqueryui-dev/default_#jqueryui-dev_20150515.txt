[06:00:31] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? One of our PRs just disappeared.
[06:00:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls?page=4&pulls_only=true&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Acreated-desc
[06:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> Notice there is no #1457.
[06:26:39] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: it 404's if you try to go directly to it
[06:26:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's gone.
[06:26:59] <arschmitz> it was one of mine
[06:27:05] <arschmitz> so it was not spam or anything
[06:27:12] <scott_gonzalez> I know.
[06:27:36] <arschmitz> oh its one jzaefferer just deleted the branch for
[06:27:42] <arschmitz> but that still should not happen thats wacky
[06:27:53] <arschmitz> means all the comments are gone too
[06:27:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the PR is supposed to live forever.
[06:28:15] <arschmitz> file an issue with github
[06:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> Already did.
[06:58:31] <jzaefferer> that's weird. I ignored the IRC notifications since it just repeated what I was doing on the site, didn't notice the PR close, which turns out to be a delete...
[06:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...
[06:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> This is odd, I can't actually find any emails about that PR, other than jzaefferer closing it.
[06:59:52] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Are you sure it was one of yours?
[07:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'm starting to think it was some random person who created a new PR based on the same branch.
[07:15:08] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: just  a sec i thought i had emails
[07:16:34] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: button classes was 1415
[07:18:34] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: whats odd is i dont have notification of 1457 ever being opened
[07:18:45] <arschmitz> which generally would only be the case if i opened it
[07:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yeah, but I don't have that email either.
[07:59:04] <scott_gonzalez> This is the response I got from GitHub: "It hasn't been deleted. It's not visible because it was opened by a user who is flagged and verified as spammy."
[07:59:17] <arschmitz> ah
[08:14:24] <jzaefferer> So I closed an invisible PR?
[08:51:24] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: apparently
[08:51:30] <arschmitz> and its pretty old based on the #
