[06:32:11] <mikesherov_> tj_vantoll1: good catch
[06:33:46] <mikesherov_> so what's happening now is that it detects the container as the scrollParent, and the default scroll: true always attempts to scroll the parent
[06:34:03] <mikesherov_> I mean, scroll: true scrolls the scrollParent
[06:35:30] <mikesherov_> so before the overflow:hidden didn't get scrolled because the scrollParent was the document and that has overflow: visible implicitly
[06:36:26] <mikesherov_> now it finds the hidden parent as the scrollParent and when it gets to the edge it scrolls the parent

[06:48:22] <tj_vantoll1> mikesherov_: Strangely enough that does make sense.
[06:48:46] <mikesherov_> I mean, it likely SHOULD do that
[06:48:53] <tj_vantoll1> We have a few tickets open related to placing overflow: hidden on the <body> I believe.
[06:49:09] <mikesherov_> hmm
[06:49:16] <mikesherov_> would be helpful if you can link those

[06:50:47] <tj_vantoll1> I believe there was one more that I closed because the OP couldn't come up with a reasonable test case.
[06:53:55] <mikesherov_> tj_vantoll1: that's a different issue, but thanks for the insight
[06:55:12] <tj_vantoll1> No problem. Gotta love draggable.
[06:56:27] <mikesherov_> tj_vantoll1: woah, looks like I fixed a bug I didn't even know about

[06:57:16] <mikesherov_> that was the first time I touched scrollParent
[06:59:35] <tj_vantoll1> So wait, it works in IE now because of that commit?
[06:59:55] <mikesherov_> yes, because the old behavior was for super old ie
[07:00:01] <mikesherov_> 9057 now works
[07:00:08] <mikesherov_> after that commit in 2013
[07:00:31] <mikesherov_> hadn't been touched since it was originally written basically
[07:00:41] <mikesherov_> like in IE 5.5 days
[07:01:21] <tj_vantoll1> wow
[07:01:44] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah I just tested this back to IE8. Works great.
[07:02:25] <tj_vantoll1> Want to close that ticket?
[07:03:14] <mikesherov_> it's closed ;-)

[09:00:02] <arschmitz> oh im sure i can come up with plenty of stuff
[09:49:31] <DaveStein> jzaefferer: hey bud, i'm back from the biggest hiatus in history and trying to fix bugs that were fixed in 1.* in my version of draggable since then. I do have an odd question about scrolling though. If the draggable's scrollParent is the window, should dragging down the scrollable still let you infinitely increase the height of the window?
[09:50:45] <DaveStein> so if you do that today, and then scroll back up, your draggable stays pinned to the bottom until the "artificial" scrollbar goes away. artificial in that the scrollbar is only needed since the draggable defines the new height by taking up space
