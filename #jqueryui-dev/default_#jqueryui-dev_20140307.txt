[04:40:11] <scottgonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you have any idea why `.add( this.range )` is on this line? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1207/files#diff-5338e738893ac05cdc5af3e4952a7c7aL152
[04:40:41] <scottgonzalez> The range is a div with no children.
[04:41:10] <scottgonzalez> So filtering to handles (or even anchors) after adding the range seems like we're just doing work for nothing.
[04:46:23] <scottgonzalez> Aha! The range used to be an anchor in some cases: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/22f25cbb0c49051b93f1531b5a105bdbb078d819#diff-956f682030610be18d36db2586e7c2a5R36

[05:14:12] <scottgonzalez> jzaefferer: recursive-blame to the rescue :-)
[05:14:44] <scottgonzalez> I was able to install it and find the answer using it faster than I could've done just using GitHub's blame :-)
[05:50:33] <scottgonzalez> About ten seconds into using Atom... https://cloudup.com/cXB3T60UI4z
[05:55:50] <scottgonzalez> Looks like they implemented their own scrolling :-(
[05:55:50] <arschmitz> nice
[05:56:51] <kborchers> scottgonzalez: have you used brackets? i've been thinking about trying that one just for fun. i still love ST2 but been thinking about trying something open source
[05:57:55] <scottgonzalez> I played with Brackets for a little bit. Definitely seems interesting.
[05:58:04] <scottgonzalez> Their debugging features look amazing.
[05:58:13] <scottgonzalez> Roundtrip debugging between node and client.
[05:58:40] <kborchers> oh is that Theseus?
[05:58:57] <kborchers> yeah
[05:59:06] <kborchers> that's looks really cool

[08:40:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[08:42:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: pong
[09:11:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[09:12:21] <arschmitz> hi
[09:12:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm still not quit sure I like the idea that you have to write JS to set initial styles for your widgets - whether it's per-widget-type or per-widget-instance.
[09:13:18] <arschmitz> ok
[09:13:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think JS should only be necessary if you wish to modify the widget's style during its lifetime.
[09:14:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well you have to remember this is only an issue if you are not using enhanced option ayway
[09:14:32] <arschmitz> at which point you are doing dom manipulation with js and styling with js anyway
[09:15:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, but so far, the library was doing it, and henceforth, we're asking the devs to do it.
[09:15:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: previously it was nit possible at all
[09:15:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, the devs were doing it so far as well, but they were doing it declaratively, via setting non-default values for the various options via data- attributes.
[09:16:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you mean it was not possible at all.
[09:16:06] <_|Nix|_> ?
[09:16:15] <arschmitz> to add or remove classes from the wrapper
[09:16:21] <arschmitz> which is basicly what this is all about
[09:16:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono. I'm only talking about initial style now.
[09:16:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The style the widget has after initial page load.
[09:16:54] <arschmitz> ok
[09:17:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So far, the way to get an initial style where the style options have non-default values is to specify those options as data-attributes.
[09:17:37] <arschmitz> right but we are removing that
[09:18:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: After those options are gone, we will have no more declarative way of specifying non-default values for the initial page load, except via JS.
[09:18:14] <arschmitz> thats right
[09:18:23] <_|Nix|_> I'm saying that's bad.
[09:18:27] <arschmitz> i disagree
[09:18:40] <arschmitz> its different i dont think its bad
[09:19:37] <arschmitz> doing things in a declarative way was a connivence for options if its not an option then its up to you
[09:20:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How is this different from what UI is doing? They have a bunch of $( ".something" ).somewidget({ option: value}); and we're gonna have a bunch of $( ".something" ).somewidget( "option", value );
[09:20:43] <arschmitz> im not sure what your asking
[09:20:54] <arschmitz> ui things like corners are not options
[09:21:32] <arschmitz> they are part of the theme and to change on a per instance basis you currently have no easy way of doing the classes option however will fix that
[09:21:44] <_|Nix|_> I thought we wanted to provide places for people to put their classes so that the resulting widget has the style they want.
[09:22:10] <arschmitz> the classes option will do that
[09:22:26] <arschmitz> and any option can be put in your markup thats part of jqm
[09:22:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and the classes option will be made accessible via a data-attribute, right?
[09:22:40] <arschmitz> of course
[09:22:44] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[09:22:47] <arschmitz> there no way for it not to be
[09:22:56] <arschmitz> it will be ugly but there
[09:23:25] <_|Nix|_> So, basically, we're replacing the data-corners="false" data-inset="true" with data-classes="{'corner': '', 'inset':'?????'}
[09:23:31] <arschmitz> data-classes="{'structureClass':'styleclass'}"
[09:23:35] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[09:23:38] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:24:29] <arschmitz> scottgonzalez: did talk about doing something like data-classes-structureclass="styleclass"
[09:24:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i mean he and i talked about that
[09:24:54] <_|Nix|_> OK. Then it sounds like we absolutely need the classes option for 1.5.0 if we wish to properly deprecate our stlye options.
[09:25:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: worst case we can extend $.Widget until it lands
[09:25:54] <arschmitz> its just a single method being added
[09:25:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... at that point, we're basically conglomerating all our style options into this one option.
[09:26:07] <arschmitz> yeah pretty much
[09:26:16] <arschmitz> but it allows the use of custom themes
[09:26:25] <arschmitz> like 3rd party
[09:26:30] <arschmitz> not jqm specific
[09:26:44] <arschmitz> i used it to put the mobile theme on all the ui widgets as a test
[09:26:57] <arschmitz> you just map the proper classes and it works
[09:27:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's awesome!
[09:27:22] <scottgonzalez> I would recommend against adding it directly to Mobile.
[09:27:31] <scottgonzalez> If you need it, work on the UI implementation.
[09:27:41] <arschmitz> scottgonzalez: thats what i was talking about
[09:27:56] <arschmitz> but that if it didnt land in ui in time we could patch the difference
[09:28:03] <scottgonzalez> " worst case we can extend $.Widget until it lands"
[09:28:06] <arschmitz> we need it for 1.5
[09:28:11] <scottgonzalez> Yeah, I'm saying don't do that.
[09:28:15] <arschmitz> ok
[09:28:38] <scottgonzalez> That's essentially our equivalent of the vendor prefixing horror.
[09:28:49] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:29:16] <arschmitz> and there is no reason we could not make that landing in ui master a blocker for 1.5
[09:29:43] <scottgonzalez> Why are you making theme-related changes at this point anyway?
[09:29:43] <arschmitz> and once its in master its the same as we have no just pull a specific tag for the widget factory
[09:29:58] <arschmitz> scottgonzalez: we are removing options from widgets
[09:30:11] <arschmitz> liek corners or shadow
[09:30:45] <arschmitz> there was a concern about "not being able to set these on a per widget basis in a declarative nature"
[09:30:50] <arschmitz> which you can now
[09:31:03] <arschmitz> and i was just saying the classes option would fix this
[09:31:25] <scottgonzalez> How was there an option that you couldn't set on a per widget basis?
[09:31:35] <scottgonzalez> And how does removing the options help?
[09:31:43] <arschmitz> no the option could be
[09:31:49] <arschmitz> we are removing the option completely
[09:32:02] <arschmitz> like corners right now is an option on most widgets in mobile
[09:32:42] <arschmitz> so you can add or remove the corners via an option which we want to remove and just set corners for the theme as a whole
[09:32:47] <arschmitz> same as ui
[09:33:05] <scottgonzalez> So that sounds like theme changes to me
[09:33:16] <scottgonzalez> I'm wondering why we're making theme changes anywhere at this pont.
[09:33:19] <scottgonzalez> *point.
[09:33:23] <arschmitz> well you can already set the radius as a whole like in ui
[09:33:36] <arschmitz> this JUST removes the option from the widget
[09:33:46] <scottgonzalez> ok
[09:34:15] <arschmitz> right now by setting corners to false it does not add the corner class
[09:34:32] <arschmitz> so you can have a square button in your otherwise rounded theme
[09:34:43] <arschmitz> we want to remove that option
[09:35:21] <arschmitz> scottgonzalez: does that make sense?
[09:35:36] <scottgonzalez> Yes, though I would set the timelines in the opposite order.
[09:35:51] <arschmitz> what do you mean?
[09:36:13] <scottgonzalez> Knowing that you want to replace it with the classes option, I would make the removal of the existing options happen whenever the classes option happens.
[09:36:20] <scottgonzalez> Whatever version that may be.
[09:36:44] <arschmitz> ok that makes sense
[09:36:45] <scottgonzalez> Instead of saying that it will definitely happen in 1.5 and then working back.
[09:37:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you still here?
[09:37:16] <scottgonzalez> Unless you're ok with knowing that Mobile can essentially be indefinitely held up by UI's implementation.
[09:38:10] <scottgonzalez> Because really I had no plans on implementing the classes option until we're making progress on the new CSS framework.
[09:38:16] <arschmitz> yeah that probably does not make sense 
[09:44:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[09:44:47] <arschmitz> maybe we should not rush removing style options
[09:44:57] <arschmitz> maybe we should just do it when classes lands in ui
[09:45:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[09:45:04] <arschmitz> when ever that is
[09:45:14] <arschmitz> i mean they are not realy hurting anything
[09:45:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, just lots of .toggleClass()
[09:45:36] <arschmitz> yeah which oh well
[09:46:04] <arschmitz> its not really hurting anything
[09:46:14] <_|Nix|_> Actually, we may endeavour to reduce all style option setting to an act of .toggleClass()
[09:46:33] <_|Nix|_> That way, we know we're systematic and ready to go.
[09:46:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hey i gotta run for a bit 
[09:47:03] <arschmitz> but we should talk more and involve uGoMobi
[09:48:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I also gotta run :)
[09:48:02] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[09:48:12] <_|Nix|_> ... and agreed.
