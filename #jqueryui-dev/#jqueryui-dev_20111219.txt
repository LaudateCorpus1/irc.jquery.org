[06:37:19] <hdon> hi all :) any plans to make draggable and droppable work with touch{start,move,end} ? I am digging through 1.8.16 source code to see how i can make this happen
[06:53:43] <kborchers> hdon: we are in the process of rewriting all of the interactions (draggable, droppable, etc.). Also, mouse is going to be replaced with a device agnostic utility that will suport touch events
[06:54:01] <kborchers> support*
[06:54:10] <hdon> kborchers: sounds reasonable. when do you think that will land? is it working in revision control?
[06:54:33] <hdon> if you have any advice for what i can do in the mean time, that would be great
[06:55:10] <hdon> how to create mouse events i can feed to draggable and droppable from touch events
[06:56:29] <kborchers> I know that the interactions are being rewritten as we speak and i believe are planned for 2.0 which is a pretty long way out. I think the new interaction utility is planned for the same time period but not exactly sure. scott_gonzalez? ^^
[06:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: that's correct, planned for 2.0, which is far out
[06:58:26] <scott_gonzalez> hdon: I think you just need to generate mouse events with the correct pageX/Y and which properties
[06:59:09] <kborchers> hdon: if you look at how jQuery Mobile handles touch events that might give you some ideas
[06:59:52] * hdon wishes jquery ui had more comments explaining the code
[07:00:25] <hdon> kborchers: that's not a bad idea, i just might do that
