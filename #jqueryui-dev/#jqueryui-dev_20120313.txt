[10:25:21] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I do, as a VM, will take a look "later"
[10:25:37] <jzaefferer> kborchers: here also a slight promise of taking a look later...
[10:26:03] <kborchers> thank you sir
[11:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Thanks for testing that datepicker bug.
[11:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> Or should I say "bug"?
[11:39:01] <jzaefferer> "hickup"
[11:39:04] <jzaefferer> kborchers: reviewed
[11:54:06] <kborchers> jzaefferer: thanks for the feedback
[12:59:03] <perlygatekeeper> hey all, what's the newest news on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4671
[13:02:06] <perlygatekeeper> hey Scott?
[13:02:10] <perlygatekeeper> you awake?
[13:03:03] <perlygatekeeper> you stated that                scottgonzalez merged commit af5b5b1 into jquery:master from kborchers:master 10 months ago                   Closed scottgonzalez closed the pull request 10 months ago  on   https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/209
[13:03:04] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (10m, 1w ago): Dialog: Modal Dialog disables vertical scroll bar in Chrome & Safari. Fixed #4671
[13:04:06] <perlygatekeeper> but on   https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/230    scottgonzalez commented12 days ago@jboesch The ticket is still open and this PR was closed without being merged.
[13:04:07] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (10m, 6d ago): Dialog: Modified creation of overlay to bind events to the overlay rather than the document object. Fixed #4671
[13:19:50] <scott_gonzalez> perlygatekeeper: #209 is a busted PR. You'll notice there's no diff.
[13:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> That's just GitHub being confused because the pull came from master instead of a branch.
[13:24:29] <perlygatekeeper> so there is no hope of this ever being fixed?
[13:24:44] <perlygatekeeper> you are making me very said
[13:31:40] <perlygatekeeper> https://github.com/ksenzee/views3ui/blob/bdf8d279d0a78b6a921e446fc7448fabffa3322d/js/jquery.ui.dialog.patch.js  <- posted by jessebeach a year ago, does this help?
[13:33:17] <perlygatekeeper> I am still seeing this issue with jquery-ui-1.8.18 installed.  Have I done something wrong?
[13:33:27] <perlygatekeeper> should it be fixed in 1.8.18?
[14:14:54] <perlygatekeeper> ok so http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/27?P=dialog&K=modal  lists #4671 as the oldest surviving bug for modal dialog
[17:58:13] <scott_gonzalez> perlygatekeeper: I don't know why you would think it would be fixed in 1.8.18.
[17:58:27] <scott_gonzalez> I'm aware that it's an old bug.
[17:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> We don't fix bugs based on date reported.
[17:58:35] <scott_gonzalez> That would be insnae.
[17:58:53] <scott_gonzalez> Also, if we were to do that, I'm sure that specific bug would be pretty far down the list.
[17:59:18] <scott_gonzalez> It will be fixed in 1.10 if nobody from the community submits a working pull request prior to that.
