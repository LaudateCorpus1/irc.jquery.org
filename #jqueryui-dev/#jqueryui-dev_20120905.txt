[05:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg kborchers: Do either of you know what .method-list was supposed to style on the API sites?
[05:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> I can't find any instances of that class.
[05:17:20] <kswedberg> hmmm. on api.jquery.com, I see <ul id="method-list" class="method-list">
[05:18:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: don't know. i would have to look
[05:19:08] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Aha, so it's just the listing pages.
[05:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I can delete these rules then.
[05:19:28] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: it would appear so. yeah, go ahead.
[05:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> Don't know why I didn't think to check the existing site.
[05:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[05:55:09] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Hi! Question. Im confused. On 1.8 download builder, the default theme differs from ui-lightness. Shall I just copy cat its default or update our rewrite default with ui-lightness?
[05:57:29] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what are the differences?
[05:57:37] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, http://pastie.org/4668005
[05:58:20] <rxaviers> (that's the theme.css difference)
[05:58:28] <jzaefferer> that looks very very different o_O
[06:01:29] <rxaviers> Im re downloading to double check
[06:02:50] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, it seems I am wrong above ^
[06:03:06] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, the default is even named ui-lightness
[06:03:09] <rxaviers> mm pardom
[06:03:31] <rxaviers> pardon*
[06:08:05] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] rxaviers created themeroller (+4 new commits): http://git.io/OP85CA
[06:08:05] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/themeroller] Renamed s/stripInput/stripReleasePath. Makes more sense now - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[06:08:05] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/themeroller] Remove unnecessary slash - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[06:08:05] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/themeroller] Fix "js/jquery-*.*.*.min.js" check on Builder unit test - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[06:11:04] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: yeah, -f is okay for that branch
[06:12:01] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, excelent, beause I am a `push -f` machine for branches :)
[06:26:13] <scott_gonzalez> The default theme is ui-lightness. The one in the git repo is smoothness.
[06:46:24] <scott_gonzalez> Who wants to write some CSS?
[06:48:13] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: what do you need? i have a meeting in 10 minutes but could take a look later today or tonight
[06:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.plugins.jquery.com
[06:48:35] <scott_gonzalez> Look at that in Chrome and Firefox.
[06:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> It's almost entirely styled with webkit only rules.
[06:49:53] <scott_gonzalez> The heading I mean.
[06:49:58] <kborchers> wat?
[06:50:17] <kborchers> seriously? why would someone use webkit only?
[06:50:21] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[06:51:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmmm, i am only seeing a color difference in the big tag line and some font-weight differences but nothing major. is that it?
[06:52:09] <kborchers> and i think the font-weight stuff is just FF vs. Chrome and not specific styles
[06:52:11] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's barely readable. Let me see if normal colors will kill the webkit colors.
[06:53:03] <kborchers> oh, it's gradients?
[06:53:25] <kborchers> yeah, that's all it is. just need the other prefixed gradients
[06:53:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ^
[06:53:38] <kborchers> the FF one is inheriting the body font color
[06:54:31] <kborchers> i can change that now and push if you want scott_gonzalez before my meeting
[06:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, if you can get that working.
[06:55:25] <scott_gonzalez> But we need it to look right in IE and Opera too.
[06:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> right = readable
[06:56:28] <scott_gonzalez> My concern is that this isn't even using color, it's using background craziness.
[06:57:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: it's for a gradient. we can use a solid color if you want like a solid light grey like #DDD or #EEE as the fallback for the gradients if not supported
[06:57:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, let's have an actual `color` property there.
[06:58:40] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: the weird part is that style is in base.css so it applies to all sites. i'll have to look after my meeting so i have time to thoroughly test before pushing
[06:59:16] <scott_gonzalez> The plugins site is the only one using it right now.
[06:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> But it's planned for a few sites.
[06:59:49] <kborchers> ok, after my meeting i'll put the solid color in the base and then override in the specific themes
[07:00:11] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi, thx for all your hard work on the api docs :) I got all the new changes up and I was wondering whether we could make the code highlighting colors a bit more "funky" or girly... (just an idea...)
[07:01:24] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Sure, I'd actually like to find a way to use a better highlighter or improve the one we're using, but feel free to change the colors.
[07:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Make sure you make the changes starting at line 642.
[07:03:09] <agcolom> ok... It's not an easy one as we want colors that will go nicely with the backgrounds that we use, but maybe we could make them a bit brighter... (and I'd like to have purple as one f the colors)
[07:04:03] <agcolom> ok... I haven't got the time right now, but I will try something soon...
[07:04:19] <agcolom> thank you :)
[07:23:35] <gnarf> agcolom: i support purple - purple is good
[07:45:45] <scott_gonzalez> green, blue, and purple are my three favorite colors.
[07:46:26] <scott_gonzalez> You know what's fun? Wading through thousands of lines of someone else's CSS :-P
[07:55:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you have a twisted sense of fun

[10:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, gotta love the names.
[10:52:21] <scott_gonzalez> What color do you want for "black"?
[10:53:27] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, Scott and Jörn, I'd like to let you guys and the team know about my future schedule. I won't be absent in the subsequent days except after my wedding (20th Oct). I plan to depart for honey moon for 10 days from 22th Oct to 31th Oct.
[10:54:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, have fun :-)
[10:54:30] <rxaviers> That's it, wedding is coming (getting pretty close) hehe
[10:54:56] <rxaviers> I would like to ensure this won't be a problem! Otherwise I may cut some days..
[10:55:35] <rxaviers> (some days off the trip)
[11:10:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez rworth jzaefferer: same database, or clone it?
[11:10:31] <jzaefferer> let's just clone it, helps avoiding mess up the live site
[11:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Don't cut your honeymoon short.
[11:17:11] <rxaviers> :)
[11:18:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: rworth: http://stage.blog.jqueryui.com/ on eol2.jquery.com

[11:19:02] <rworth> rxaviers and have a great time. Congrats!
[11:19:03] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...is that running off of web-base-template?
[11:19:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you might have old dns
[11:20:04] <gnarf> if you don't see an exact clone of the old one
[11:20:44] <scott_gonzalez> That must be it.
[11:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...flushing dns didn't help. Must be waiting for it to propagate.
[11:25:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ttl was like 1800
[11:25:44] <gnarf> so it should update within an hour
[11:25:50] <gnarf> half our
[11:25:58] <gnarf> you could hosts file it
[11:26:04] <gnarf> to the same ip as blog.jqueryui.com
[11:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just wait. I'm not going to be working on it right this minute anyway.

[12:06:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seem right yet?
[12:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[12:07:58] <gnarf> hrm
[12:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> haha, I have it hard-coded in my hosts file.
[12:08:35] <gnarf> second opinion anyone? http://stage.blog.jqueryui.com/ does that look like http://blog.jqueryui.com/ or a web-base-template
[12:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> I should just drop all the stage domains from my hosts file.
[12:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> ok, it looks right :-)
[12:11:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: :)
[12:11:46] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: looks fine to me :)
[12:27:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do you need anything else from me for the stage.blog?
[12:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> We'll eventually want to have a repo cloned into the themes directory.
[12:28:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'll let you know when the repo exists.

[13:08:02] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu: Don't move focus from the active item on click. Fixes #8552 - selected value overwritten/not correctly set. - Scott González
[13:09:35] <kborchers> :/
[13:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> That's a general issue that we need to solve.
[13:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> We need simulate helpers.
[13:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> Well, really we need something better than .simulate() :-P
[13:10:43] <kborchers> yeah
[13:11:54] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the menu tests ran in IE6-8 and no failures yet.
[13:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> I think we're safe.

[13:21:27] <kborchers> :P
[14:50:35] <ajpiano> gnarf: does stage.*.jquery.com still require a hosts entry
[16:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: no
[17:05:40] <gnarf> ajpiano: what scott_gonzalez said
[18:04:12] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: here is the nightly "still around?" question :)
[18:05:51] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: yeah
[18:06:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: well, i was going to work on menu tonight but you fixed that so just wondering what was a priority that still needs work. was thinking about taking a stab at https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/42 but wanted to check in first
[18:09:37] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to work on that.
[18:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> I wasn't going to even take a stab at that until after the release.
[18:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> The two next things on my list are jqueryui.com demos and blog.jqueryui.com.
[18:11:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, well let me know if anything more important for the release comes up that you need help on. until then i'll work on that easing demo
[18:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> You can review demos and visual tests :-)
[18:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> Here's the list: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0_zCSCATeXQJG6ULC0ELl5Pt4CK33a7X2ku78ylCsA/edit?pli=1#
[18:13:13] <kborchers> sounds like a blast :P … ok, i'll run through those
[18:13:21] <kborchers> demos and visual tests i mean
[18:17:41] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good :-)
[18:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, now that I've asked your questions, time for me to disappear and go move boxes and furniture out to the garage...

[19:07:00] <kborchers> hey gnarf you around?
[19:07:52] <kborchers> anyone around that can verify something for me?
[19:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I'm back.
[19:11:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: cool, got a minute? i found an issue with a visual test that i don't think we can do anything about but want someone to verify i'm not crazy
[19:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> sur
[19:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[19:12:13] <kborchers> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/tooltip/animations.html
[19:12:41] <kborchers> in the show:bounce/hide:blind example
[19:13:01] <kborchers> in chrome stable i get a weird artifact left after the hide but in canary it's fine
[19:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, Chrome has gotten pretty shitty about artifacts.
[19:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> Unless gnarf has an idea, I don't think we can do anything about it.
[19:14:15] <kborchers> ok, that's kind of what i figured but wanted to make sure … looks like it will be fixed eventually in 23 though :)
[19:14:58] <scott_gonzalez> At least they release frequently.
[19:15:45] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: they release faster than they update the cdn :P
[19:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[19:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> The sad thing is that sometimes that's true :-/
[19:16:09] <kborchers> i know
[19:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I did think of something you can work on.
[19:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> You can come pack up my house...
[19:17:29] <kborchers> sounds like more fun than running through demos :P
[19:17:36] <kborchers> wait
[19:17:39] <kborchers> you moving?
[19:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, moving back to PA at the end of the year.
[19:18:36] <kborchers> oh wow. where at?
[19:18:38] <scott_gonzalez> We're moving as much as we can into storage next weekend.
[19:18:48] <scott_gonzalez> York. We're having a house built :-)
[19:18:54] <kborchers> nice!
[19:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> That will actually make Chicago drivable.
[19:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> A long drive, but doable.
[19:21:13] <kborchers> yeah, i've made that drive basically … drove to Paxinos (small town south of Danville)
[19:21:25] <kborchers> my wife grew up there
[19:31:03] <kborchers> wow going through demos takes _FOR EVER_

[19:44:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i know why it does what it does but seems like this demo doesn't work right http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/#resizable|constrain-area
[19:45:44] <kborchers> just feels wrong that you say constrain to this area and then it can go outside of that area
[19:48:29] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Yeah, that's just a bug, not a regression.
[19:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> We're ok with that cuz interactions are borked :-P
[19:49:32] <kborchers> right, ok
