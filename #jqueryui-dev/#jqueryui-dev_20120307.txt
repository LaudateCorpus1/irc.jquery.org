[09:40:15] <kborchers> sorry guys, missed the meeting and just read back through. my schedule is all messed up from traveling and playing catch up now that i'm back
[09:40:58] <jzaefferer> kborchers: also from wearing red hats!
[09:41:08] <kborchers> heh
[09:41:40] <kborchers> i blame drinking and staying up late with scott_gonzalez :P
[09:42:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's a good excuse.
[09:48:44] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'll work through those TODOs now, will get grunting again tomorrow
[09:48:58] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[09:49:47] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Where's the PR you mentioned re: banner and concat?
[09:50:09] <jzaefferer> no PR yet
[09:50:32] <jzaefferer> just making changes to grunt itself locally, once I got it figured out I'd send a PR against cowboy/grunt
[09:50:38] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:34:31] <jzaefferer> I hate this Chrome bug where reloading from a breakpoint will prevent file cache flushing, loading the same files again, breaking at the same spot, forcing me to manually clear the cache

[10:37:11] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Accordion: Added missing semicolon.
[10:38:01] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: should _activate do anything when the accordion is disabled?
[10:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> Probably.
[10:38:52] <scott_gonzalez> Disabled should really only apply to user interaction.
[10:39:08] <scott_gonzalez> If a dev calls .option( "active", 2 ) while the accordion is disabled, it should still activate.
[10:41:09] <jzaefferer> okay, then I'll fix that
[10:45:37] <jzaefferer> just one failing test to go...
[10:46:51] <jzaefferer> we need to land the lint stuff, then spend the necessary time to get it to pass
[10:46:57] <jzaefferer> did that for QUnit today
[10:47:03] <jzaefferer> helped find quite a few issue
