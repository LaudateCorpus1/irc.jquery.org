[05:52:13] <jzaefferer> hello Justin_o
[05:52:27] <Justin_o> jzaefferer: hello
[05:53:41] <jzaefferer> looking forward to better TestSwarm output on Jenkins builds :-)
[05:57:38] <Justin_o> jzaefferer: Yes it would be great to have, I'll look into the TAP and JUnit/Ant formats
[06:54:29] <jzaefferer> Justin_o: regarding BrowserStack and Fluid, you should ping scott_gonzalez, he can probably tell you more
[06:54:55] <jzaefferer> btw. scott_gonzalez: this could be useful for inspecting the various node modules of the plugin site: https://github.com/goldjunge/prof
[06:55:56] <Justin_o> jzaefferer: great thanks, i'll try to get in touch with scott_gonzalez
[06:56:12] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: if you have a chance to chat about BrowserStack at some point please let me know
[06:56:34] <scott_gonzalez> Justin_o: Sure. I can talk now if you want
[06:59:07] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: hey thanks..
[06:59:46] <kborchers> hey scott_gonzalez just curious, have you heard how they plan to implement mobile browsers? emulators? just not sure how well that could be trusted
[07:00:15] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, I believe it will be emulators
[07:01:27] <kborchers> ok, i ran into an issue last night where mu Android 2.3.3 emulator showed the mobile version based on min-/max-device-width media queries but a real device showed desktop version :(
[07:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, kborchers, gnarf, anyone else: This seems reasonable, right? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/580
[07:36:34] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by SpoonNZ (11h, 41m ago): Proposed fix for Bug #4759
[07:36:53] <scott_gonzalez> I hate interaction PRs because they always break stuff, but this one actually seems safe.
[07:39:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i haven't tested it but that seems safe and reasonable
[07:39:36] <kborchers> note the "i haven't tested" part to avoid blame if something breaks :P
[07:39:53] <scott_gonzalez> Heh
[07:40:26] <scott_gonzalez> He actually didn't test at first either :-P
[07:40:41] <scott_gonzalez> He sent a PR, then closed it and opened a new one, leaving a comment on the first "I should've tested"
[07:40:52] <kborchers> wat? how do you submit a PR without testing it?
[07:40:54] <kborchers> heh
[07:42:29] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...how do you do that define term thing with bot-t?
[07:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> ?wat
[07:42:30] <bot-t> Boom! Did you are unimpressed? and now? http://bit.ly/i2SDjX
[07:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> Have you seen https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat?
[07:47:40] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that video is great

[10:51:09] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yt?
[13:13:35] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez:  I should be back to being helpful this weekend after my disappearance. Last month or two was crazy for me
[13:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Have you seen what I did?
[13:14:28] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: i saw you updated wiki but haven't had chance to really read. i was planning on reading and then pulling and looking at changes
[13:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> have fun with that :-)
[13:14:52] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: think you changed it so much i won't be able to find my way?
[13:14:56] <scott_gonzalez> I implemented the interaction layer for touch and MSPointer
[13:15:10] <scott_gonzalez> You'll definitely be able to follow it.
[13:15:12] <Dave_Stein> okay that should be nice
[13:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> Just never use the event object to get data.
[13:15:30] <Dave_Stein> gotcha
[13:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> Treat the event objects as bombs just waiting to go off :-P
[13:15:45] <Dave_Stein> does the interaction layer provide data related to th event that i need then?
[13:15:53] <Dave_Stein> like X/Y
[13:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they're passed as a second parameter now.
[13:16:05] <Dave_Stein> okay cool
[13:16:19] <Dave_Stein> what's in interactions now? i know i had droppable and draggable. did you get started on any others?
[13:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> And the start event also receives the event target
[13:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> Or something like that
[13:16:36] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, still just those.
[13:16:46] <Dave_Stein> i hope your wiki is good :D I'll make any updates if i find anything you missed
[13:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> I did add one or two options though.
[13:16:53] <Dave_Stein> okay cool that's not bad
[13:17:08] <Dave_Stein> last sunday was my first free sunday and i was like fuckit im not doing jquery today this week kicked my ass
[13:17:25] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the scrolling got a bit wonky when I made changes.
[13:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't dug into it yet.
[13:17:50] <Dave_Stein> figures, that was the last thing i did before i disappeared
[13:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> If the draggable's scroll parent is the body, then scrolling is bad.
[13:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> But if it has a different scroll parent it seems to work properly.
[13:18:38] <scott_gonzalez> You were using clientX/Y before, I changed it pageX/Y
[13:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's what caused the changed behavior, but I haven't really looked into it yet.
[13:19:06] <Dave_Stein> okay
[13:19:10] <Dave_Stein> i'll take a look under the hood there
[13:19:15] <Dave_Stein> i know there's def differences if it's not body
[13:19:19] <Dave_Stein> or window rather
[13:19:42] <Dave_Stein> so i'll take a look into that, and get back to the TODOs that are sitting around
[13:19:50] <Dave_Stein> and then hopefully get onto simple sortable functionality
[13:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> Cool.
[13:19:59] <Dave_Stein> although thats prob too ambitious for random sunday time
[13:20:05] <Dave_Stein> hows 1.9 been goin?
[13:20:14] <Dave_Stein> i get selectmenu wiki updates nonstop - seems to be most active thing ever
[13:21:03] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, yeah, tooltip and spinner are pretty stable.
[13:21:28] <scott_gonzalez> Still a ton of work left for 1.9. Seems like a never ending project.
[13:21:34] <Dave_Stein> i know how that feels
[13:21:40] <Dave_Stein> which makes it better when they're done
[13:21:51] <Dave_Stein> i'll be happy to use a ui spinner rather than some random object spinner we have from some other place
[13:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> Have you tried out the spinner?
[13:22:25] <Dave_Stein> not yet, haven't tried 1.9 things yet although the first thing i'll be looking at is selectmenu, to replace the old crap one everyone here hates
[13:23:04] <scott_gonzalez> Selectmenu is still under fairly active development.
[13:23:08] <Dave_Stein> right now i'm upgrading things to jq 1.7 on behance.net
[13:23:18] <Dave_Stein> like a few diff sections are getting it
[13:23:19] <scott_gonzalez> Spinner is at least 90% done.
[13:23:27] <Dave_Stein> so it's kinda a nightmare to have some site in 1.7 and some in 1.6
[13:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I bet.
[13:23:42] <Dave_Stein> that's depressing news for my team ;) I'll take a look at spinner sooner then
[13:24:50] <Dave_Stein> now im curious to look at it's code - how much can there be for a spinner? ha
[13:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> Hah, way more than you'd expect
[13:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> It's kinda crazy how many ways you can work with a spinner.
[13:25:49] <Dave_Stein> we just use it to uhhh spin
[13:25:54] <Dave_Stein> and have different colors depending on site skins
[13:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> Using a mouse via buttons, using a mouse via scrollwheel, using the keyboard, using the JS API
[13:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> Hahaha...it's not a loading indicator
[13:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's a number stepper.
[13:26:53] <Dave_Stein> lol whoops
[13:27:27] <Dave_Stein> like one of those old fashioned clocks? :)
[13:27:38] <Dave_Stein> i'll just go look for a demo so i'm not as clueless
[13:28:06] <Dave_Stein> oh spinner is a combo box?
[13:28:27] <scott_gonzalez> not exactly a combobox
[13:28:37] <scott_gonzalez> You can type into it and spin, there's no dropdown
[13:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/spinner/default.html
[13:28:53] <Dave_Stein> yeah im there now
[13:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> It also supports Globalize, so you can spin different types of numbers: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/spinner/currency.html
[13:29:17] <Dave_Stein> oh that's cool
[13:29:31] <Dave_Stein> i never used a plugin for that basic functionality cause it's so simple when you don't need those options
[13:29:32] <Dave_Stein> http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/product/17/action-book
[13:29:53] <Dave_Stein> i think i do it in like 30 lines or so to do the clicks and check if number is valid and whatnot
[13:30:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, but no keyboard support
[13:30:30] <Dave_Stein> you are correct, aside from typing
[13:31:08] <Dave_Stein> i'm supposed to do some upgrades to that site at some point in the next month or so... i'll take a look at spinner then
[13:31:21] <Dave_Stein> nothing i'm working on needs it except that page
[13:31:26] <Dave_Stein> which is weird now that i think of it
[13:31:58] <Dave_Stein> this is the "spin" i was thinking of earlier btw http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/#v1.2.1
[13:32:27] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, spin.js is nice
[13:32:30] <Dave_Stein> the fact that it can be used without jquery is what bugs me cause that ujst means there's extra code in there for people not using jq and im definitely using jq
[13:33:38] <Dave_Stein> anyway i think ill get back to work. just wanted to check in with ya to let you know i'm not dead ha
[13:34:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:34:43] <Dave_Stein> talk to ya soon
