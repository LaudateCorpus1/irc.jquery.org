[05:57:42] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, hello Jörn! Regarding Brad question, what's your suggestion? Should we implement another event on Editable triggered when the form is created, so the user can customize input with whatever he wants - eg Mask?
[05:58:20] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: isn't that what the editor option should take care of?
[06:02:50] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, one approach is to take Mask specific options into editorOptions and handle it inside Editable, another is to simply trigger a 'editstart' event and leave to the user the complexity of fine tunning input...
[06:04:36] <jzaefferer> right, but if we implement the editor and editorOptions options, using a mask is just.. editable({editor:"mask", editorOptions:{mask:"whatever"}})
[06:05:39] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ok I see. Very straightforward
[06:06:37] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, thanks for your thoughts
[06:07:37] <jzaefferer> can you get that into your implementation?
[06:14:01] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, sure! will do that
[06:14:10] <jzaefferer> cool
[06:14:57] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: can you add an example editing table cells without buttons?
[06:15:18] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, we do already at demo/.../buttons
[06:15:41] <jzaefferer> in general, the functional spec here http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137959/Editable should be implemented, or if there's stuff thats not good, add notes what needs to change
[06:16:00] <jzaefferer> I don't see a table element there
[06:16:03] <rxaviers> well, ok ok ..
[06:16:15] <rxaviers> we do have one input only without buttons.. I will add a table example
[06:21:45] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, On the editable spec, what do you think is missing and should be there? A general explanation and the mask add-on we're going to implement?
[06:27:29] <jzaefferer> I was asking you, if you think there's anything missing, based on your experience implementing/porting edtiable
[06:27:54] <jzaefferer> if you think it covers whatever we need and your editable implements that, then its all good
[07:10:16] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ok, got it. will check it out
[07:33:10] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, one quick question, where do I find mask git branch?
[07:33:30] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ah! never mind
[07:39:42] <gnarf> heh
[07:39:51] <gnarf> "mask" ? :)
[07:39:57] <gnarf> its got a timepicker too
[07:59:00] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: If I can drop my editor widget and replace it with editable, while this continues to work, we'd be all good in regards to the grid: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/grid/grid-editing/grid-editor.js
[07:59:24] <jzaefferer> of course adding buttons: false or something
[08:00:35] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ok
[08:01:19] <rxaviers> I will try some examples and see what current editable is capable of
[08:01:59] <rxaviers> gnarf, nice plugin (mask). we will make editable able to use it
[08:02:16] <gnarf> rxaviers: thanks
[08:03:15] <gnarf> still has some cleanup to happen
[08:03:20] <gnarf> but it seems to work well enough
[08:09:51] <rxaviers> cool
[09:14:25] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Mask editor added, it was pretty simple https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/tree/editable-mask/demos/editable
[14:32:17] <rxaviers> gnarf, Hi Corey
[14:32:35] <rxaviers> gnarf, On timepicker widget destroy method, I found this:
[14:32:38] <rxaviers> this._super.destroy();
[14:32:57] <rxaviers> shouldn't this be 		this._super( "destroy" );
[14:33:11] <gnarf> probably?
[14:33:24] <gnarf> :)
[14:33:27] <rxaviers> :)
[14:34:09] <gnarf> you @rxaviers on github? :)
[14:34:17] <rxaviers> yeap
[14:36:14] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to mask: http://git.io/F_yFfQ
[14:36:14] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/mask] Timepicker: fixing a call to _super - bug spotted by @rxaviers - Corey Frang
[14:36:24] <gnarf> thanks :)
[14:36:37] <rxaviers> gnarf, quick huh, thanks!
[14:37:18] <gnarf> yeah - nice easy one ;)
[14:37:23] <rxaviers> :D
[14:37:26] <gnarf> I prolly woulda spotted it in the units
[14:37:29] <gnarf> but i haven't written em yet
[14:38:15] <rxaviers> your widgets are almost to be supported on editable, my demo spotted it..
[14:38:18] <rxaviers> hehe
[14:39:00] <gnarf> hey - you got any idea what a "raw value" for that timepicker should be?
[14:54:40] <rxaviers> gnarf, sorry for the delay... I am not sure if I fully undestood. But, I'm leaving the "raw value" work for the user (or grid) to deal with... :)  I'm basically using a time-string as initial value for my editable vs. timepicker demo...
[14:54:55] <rxaviers> (if my window doesnt blink urgent to me using rxaviers I take long to check)
[14:55:13] <gnarf> same here on the alerts
[14:55:18] <gnarf> but it wasn't really worthy of one
[14:55:22] <rxaviers> :)
[14:55:23] <rxaviers> ok
[14:55:37] <gnarf> got a link to the demo?
[14:55:37] <rxaviers> My timepicker demo is at https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/blob/editable-mask/demos/editable/editors.html
[14:55:59] <rxaviers> But, Im afraid you'll need to first clone it to see, right
[14:56:13] <gnarf> not really
[14:56:14] <gnarf> ;)
[14:56:21] <rxaviers> gnarf, ah! how do you?
[14:56:29] <gnarf> i add you as a remote
[14:56:33] <gnarf> then check it out
[14:56:42] <rxaviers> alright ok ;)
[14:56:46] <rxaviers> quicker
[14:57:01] <gnarf> git remote add -f rxaviers git://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui.git ; git checkout rxaviers/editable-mask
[14:57:30] <rxaviers> :)
[14:59:08] <gnarf> yeah, way better than cloning again :)
[15:04:13] <gnarf> i need to write a little bash alias tho for that
[15:04:24] <gnarf> like have it assume that the current directory name is the .git
[15:05:02] <gnarf> nice demo btws
[15:05:41] <gnarf> do the enter/esc keys work inside the masks?
[15:05:47] <gnarf> cuz i think i might be preventing esc
[15:06:31] <gnarf> seems to work
[15:06:32] <gnarf> *shrugs*
[15:06:47] <gnarf> you might wanna use the clearEmpty: false option on the mask
[15:07:09] <gnarf> so you don't go from __/__/____ to "click to edit"
[15:07:59] <gnarf> rxaviers: doesn't seem the "enter" is working in the mask fields
[15:08:10] <gnarf> or any field for that matter
[15:08:18] <gnarf> save button works tho
[15:08:19] <rxaviers> oh oh
[15:08:25] <rxaviers> let me check
[15:09:02] <rxaviers> hm weird. works for me..  what browser do you use?
[15:09:10] <gnarf> chrome canary
[15:09:29] <rxaviers> im on firefox, let me try chrome
[15:09:29] <gnarf> i type some stuff, press enter, and it reverts
[15:09:42] <gnarf> it seems to save tho
[15:09:48] <gnarf> for like a brief moment
[15:09:51] <gnarf> but then it resets
[15:09:57] <gnarf> it might be the form submitting
[15:10:09] <gnarf> yeah
[15:10:18] <gnarf> its actually refreshing the page
[15:10:38] <rxaviers> gnarf, ah! right.. on chrome it's not working. aff
[15:10:50] <gnarf> random curiosity
[15:10:58] <gnarf> have you made a way to "group" the editables?
[15:11:09] <rxaviers> gnarf, right.. the form seems to submit anyway, although I return false
[15:11:10] <gnarf> like say everything in this <div> thats editable should go editable at the same time?
[15:11:51] <gnarf> rxaviers: wheres the return false?
[15:12:02] <rxaviers> gnarf, you can accomplish that by clicking "Edit all" button up in the demo. Is it what you mean?
[15:12:25] <gnarf> kinda yeah, but in smaller groups, looking at the demo code tho, its pretty straightforward
[15:12:34] <gnarf> i was just thinking more of like
[15:12:41] <gnarf> click inside a row, the whole row goes editable
[15:12:50] <rxaviers> gnarf, yeap, it's possible this way:
[15:13:13] <rxaviers> $("ui-editable", row).editable("start")
[15:13:22] <rxaviers> the table demo is comming soon :)
[15:14:00] <rxaviers> gnarf, you are right, where's the return false
[15:14:42] <rxaviers> gnarf, ah! line 168
[15:14:44] <gnarf> e.preventDefault() is prolly all you need
[15:15:20] <gnarf> hrm
[15:15:25] <gnarf> thats why
[15:15:46] <gnarf> you want this.element.closest( "form" ) instead of $( "form", this.element ) right?
[15:16:07] <gnarf> but you don't want to return false there either
[15:16:23] <gnarf> or is there a form inside the element?
[15:16:25] <gnarf> wait
[15:16:28] * gnarf confuzed
[15:16:31] <gnarf> will look when i get back
[15:17:07] <rxaviers> gnarf, the DOM structure is:  this.element > form > span > input
