[02:21:04] <agcolom> Hey Jasper, are you around?
[02:21:15] <agcolom> Good morning! 
[02:28:16] <agcolom> ?tell uGoMobi: Hi Jasper, I've created a reflow example with two rows of headings (and grouped columns headers), as requested by https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/149. The example can be seen at http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/resources/table/example3.html
[02:28:16] <b-ot> agcolom: Iâ€™ll tell uGoMobi: about that.
[02:29:01] <agcolom> ?tell uGoMobi: please let me know if you're happy with it and i'll incorporate it in the api docs. We could also add it to the demo center
[02:29:01] <b-ot> agcolom: Iâ€™ll tell uGoMobi: about that.

[03:33:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: great, example looks nice
[03:33:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think we should add to demos
[03:35:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: so we have basic examples in API docs and more customized things in demos

[03:40:44] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[03:40:49] <uGoMobi> lol
[03:40:52] <_|Nix|_> frequent: What's up?
[03:41:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: St00pid multiple kb layouts.
[03:41:04] <uGoMobi> Finish keyboard _|Nix|_ ? ;)
[03:41:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: When my wife uses it, yes. Then I switch back to US.
[03:41:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The keys are labelled as Finnish, though.
[03:42:04] <uGoMobi> Finnish*
[03:42:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, I quickly make sure to finish with my Finnish keyboard.
[03:43:29] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hey
[03:43:45] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Comment Ã§a va?
[03:44:12] <frequent> _|Nix|_: Ã§a va
[03:44:22] <frequent> _|Nix|_: popup....
[03:44:41] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Oh, so you had a popup issue pop up?
[03:44:58] <frequent> say that in French please ;-)
[03:45:43] <frequent> $.mobile.popup.handleLink, variable scope will not work with popups outside of the page, because clicked link may be on a page while the popup to open is outside
[03:45:47] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Whenever I try to speak French I end up speaking Finnish. It's like Finnish overwrites what little French I remember from highschool.
[03:46:15] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Exactly, which is why I create http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/examples/popups/multipage.php
[03:46:23] <_|Nix|_> s/create/created/
[03:46:39] <frequent> _|Nix|_: 404
[03:46:48] <frequent> :-)
[03:46:49] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Might've typoed ... hold on.
[03:48:14] <_|Nix|_> frequent: OK, weird ... I pushed it ...
[03:48:39] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Meanwhile, try http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/demos/examples/popups/multipage.php
[03:49:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: view.jquerymobile.com hasn't been updated with my latest example :(
[03:50:00] <_|Nix|_> frequent: But, basically, you have to handle the click yourself.
[03:50:11] <frequent> _|Nix|_: yes. see it now.
[03:50:27] <frequent> was just wondering if it was feasable to sneak it into the popup widget, but have not tried
[03:50:36] <frequent> will suffice for now
[03:50:41] <frequent> thx
[03:50:45] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I want to avoid selectors that traverse the entire DOM.
[03:51:01] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Finding the popup outside the page would require such a selector.
[03:51:11] <frequent> good point
[03:51:38] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I could try $( "body" ).children( selector ) and specify that it must be a direct child of <body> ...
[03:51:57] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Actually, I think I might do just that.
[03:52:26] <_|Nix|_> frequent: After all, <body> shouldn't have too many children.
[03:52:37] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... and this is a very specific use case.
[03:52:48] <frequent> good idea, too
[03:52:56] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I'll probably do that for 1.4.1, if anything.
[03:53:05] <frequent> ok
[03:53:25] <_|Nix|_> frequent: In the meantime, I don't think the solution from that example is too-too bad.
[03:53:41] <frequent> correct. integrating it at the moment.
[03:56:48] <frequent> _|Nix|_: merci beaucoup

[03:57:59] <frequent> _|Nix|_: oh and I was spoke with a museum guide, who told me she had to learn Finnish and while she was learning, she forgot all the other languages she learned. 
[03:58:01] <_|Nix|_> frequent: De rien.
[03:58:02] <frequent> So I understand why your French becomes Finnish
[03:58:06] <frequent> :-)
[03:58:12] <frequent> was/once
[03:58:55] <_|Nix|_> frequent: C'est trÃ¨s Ã©trange ...
[03:59:50] <_|Nix|_> frequent: It's actually not so bad. Given enough exposure, I can slowly re-align my language centre - but it takes a concerted effort.
[04:01:22] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ya, the re-aligning I'm also mostly fighting with. Although I'm trying to pluck what little is left of Latin on what little I know of French...

[04:12:01] <frequent> _|Nix|_: sorry. was attending to my cornflakes.
[04:17:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, view.* is still on a commit of Ghislain from last Friday
[04:17:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's ask on -infrastructure
[04:22:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I asked on infrastucture channel
[05:26:49] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_ uGoMobi:
[05:31:43] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz
[05:32:01] <uGoMobi> how are you?
[05:32:11] <uGoMobi> still sick?
[05:36:57] <arschmitz> no felling much better
[05:40:31] <uGoMobi> glad to hear that
[05:42:15] <arschmitz> im going to go through 1.4 open issues today
[05:42:30] <arschmitz> and see what i can get fixed
[06:20:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good morning!
[06:27:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was thinking about your conversation with uGoMobi yesterday about swipe
[06:28:25] <arschmitz> and how it triggers swipe on page when you swipe on child paragraphs
[06:29:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that is how events work. the event bubbles so a swipe on a child will always trigger on parent. if you dont want to use child swipes like that you need to check e.target
[06:30:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so really thats an issue with the demo not the event
[06:31:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will look into improving that demo
[06:32:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok if you need any help just let me know if i recall the issue was with popups so you might just check that the original target is not a child of a popup
[06:34:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, thanks
[06:43:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I checked that, and event.target is the page.
[06:43:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Whereas it should be the paragraph, because the vmousedown happens on the paragraph, not the page.
[06:44:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So this may be a bug with the event.
[06:44:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I looked at the implementation and it seems to track the element where the event originates. So, that information must be getting lost somewhere.
[06:45:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can try to write a simple test case.
[06:48:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The thing is, one should never attach a swipe handler to the page, because the page itself is never exposed, so event.target will (or should) never be the page.
[06:48:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, you can attach to the page because of bubbling, but you shouldn't if you care about where it originate.
[06:48:40] <_|Nix|_> s
[06:49:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, the fact is that, AFAICT, event.target for the swipe event is wrong.
[07:01:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... it appears to be working correctly: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/swipe-test.html
[07:03:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool
[07:03:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... so I don't get what's going on in the demo.
[07:04:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll look again in case I was hallucinating yesterday.
[07:04:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was hallucinating yesterday.
[07:05:01] <arschmitz> lol ok
[07:06:06] <arschmitz> well at least the event works properly
[07:09:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. *phew* ...
[07:09:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Swipe demo fixed. I think we can now remove the selection-prevention CSS.
[07:09:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh, awesome
[07:10:52] <uGoMobi> I am going to have so many conflicts when rebasing demos-update branch :/
[07:12:08] <uGoMobi> will merge that soon so everything is on master
[07:13:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Want me to commit the fix to demos-update?
[07:14:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I wanted to do demos update in one commit
[07:14:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I didn't push yet
[07:15:00] <uGoMobi> demos-update on remote is just first pass
[07:15:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so master or demos-update will both give conflict
[07:15:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK, but I don't think it's a good idea to have massive commits that touch 1.0e6 files.
[07:15:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... even for demos.
[07:15:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why not?
[07:16:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you break anything, you don't have a single commit which you can revert to fix that one broken thing.
[07:16:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Instead, you have to write the fix by hand, and commit on top of the enormous commit.
[07:18:29] <agcolom> Hey Jasper, Gabriel :-)
[07:18:33] <agcolom> I'm back.
[07:18:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think that's a problem with demos update
[07:18:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hey Anne
[07:19:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[07:19:17] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hey!
[07:19:20] <agcolom> uGoMobi: so should I take the example out of the api site (that's easy as not yet incorporated in the docs, but just uploaded to the resources folder)
[07:19:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: otherwise you will get 500 commits just to update all demos because they are broken
[07:19:41] <agcolom> and then I can just add it to the demo center?
[07:20:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah
[07:21:29] <agcolom> ok, will do that now.
[07:21:57] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok great
[07:22:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK ... I'll push to master then.
[07:22:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok thanks
[07:23:15] <_|Nix|_> I've noticed that the syntaxhighlighter eliminates blank lines.
[07:23:19] <_|Nix|_> That's kinda bad.
[07:23:29] <uGoMobi> yeah noticed that too
[07:23:38] <uGoMobi> it's like that from the beginning
[07:23:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I think we looked into it together once

[07:31:59] <agcolom> are we happy to just have it in latest?

[07:34:01] <agcolom> ok
[07:34:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you have access to the UI/Mobile Austin meeting document that Scott created?
[07:35:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: "You can use data-collapsed-icon="false" to have a collapsible without icons." Is that also true for data-expanded-icon?
[07:35:08] <uGoMobi> or never got the link since you were not going to Austin?
[07:35:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think so.
[07:35:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I got the link.
[07:35:19] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Does that folder exist already? I can't find it
[07:35:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, I tested that and you should only use it for data-collapsed-icon
[07:35:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that results in no expanded icon as well
[07:35:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK.
[07:36:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[07:36:07] <uGoMobi> if you set data-expanded-icon="false" you get no icon but you do get a bg disc
[07:36:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's bad.
[07:37:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, that UI/Mobile meeting doc gives you good idea of what has been discussed / worked on
[07:38:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we talk a bit more about the Austin meeting during Thursday's meeting, to make sure everyone is updated
[07:39:47] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Do you have time to talk about documenting widget extension points later today?
[07:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> I need to take jzaefferer to the aiprot in about 20 minutes.
[07:40:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, looks like expandedIcon threats "false" as icon name
[07:40:11] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Does that folder exist already? I can't find it
[07:40:12] <uGoMobi> safe travels jzaefferer !
[07:40:26] <uGoMobi> agcolom: no
[07:40:30] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Yeah
[07:40:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: new folder
[07:41:11] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I'm free pretty much all day.
[07:41:15] <agcolom> yes, have a safe journey back jzaefferer. Hope you have a coat/jacket with you or someone is bringing you one at the airport. European weather is not quite like Austin ;-)
[07:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Ok, I'll ping you when I get back.
[07:41:40] <uGoMobi> and that's an understatement
[07:41:44] <uGoMobi> brrr
[07:44:53] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, so new folder. So what should I add there? an index.php page that would be like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/demos/widgets/table-reflow/index.php or that would be just for the double headings section?
[07:45:29] <agcolom> or just the example, starting from <table data-role="table" id=" ... ?
[07:46:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, just an index.php page
[07:46:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: add heading with title of the demo
[07:47:17] <uGoMobi> and maybe paragraph with intro/instructions
[07:47:21] <uGoMobi> and then the demo
[07:47:52] <agcolom> ok, so just a page for that particular case. Can I pinch the text from the corresponding section in the table-reflow page?

[08:24:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : we already deprecated ui-btn-corner-all in favor of ui-btn.ui-corner-all. I actually want to change ui-corner-all to ui-corner
[08:24:59] <uGoMobi> lol kborchers 
[08:25:16] <rxaviers> lol
[08:25:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : I will leave ui-corner-all in the theme CSS but replace it in all widgets
[08:25:53] <uGoMobi> any objections?
[08:26:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[08:26:29] <uGoMobi> wite less, do more :)
[08:26:34] <agcolom> kborchers: :-)
[08:26:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's funny on multiple levels ...
[08:26:46] <uGoMobi> the -all part doesn't make sense anymore
[08:26:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: only advantage of ui-corner all
[08:26:56] <arschmitz> is thats what ui-uses
[08:27:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so it ui widgets we pull in the corner class could stay the same with ui-corner-all
[08:27:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm good point
[08:28:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im in favor or removing ui-btn-corner-all to replace by .ui-btn.corner-all though
[08:29:14] <arschmitz> like the class consistancy
[08:29:35] <uGoMobi> yeah, that's already done
[08:29:54] <uGoMobi> does UI use any other corner class than ui-corner-all?
[08:29:59] <arschmitz> yes
[08:30:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok then let's wait with this

[09:03:01] <_|Nix|_> frequent: It should be external-2.php
[09:03:37] <frequent> yup. I also go from a.html to b.html to a.html#menu
[09:04:06] <frequent> _|Nix|_: could it be that the panel is regarded as a page, because it's a sibling of document?
[09:04:26] <_|Nix|_> frequent: No idea. I haven't really looked at this in detail.
[09:04:30] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I'll dive in.
[09:04:49] <frequent> _|Nix|_:  I will also poke around
[09:04:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Did http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/panels/external.php work when you merged ext-panels?
[09:05:01] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I wanna do a git bisect.
[09:05:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that used to work
[09:05:23] <frequent> _|Nix|_: that sounds dangerous...
[09:05:29] <frequent> (looks for a helmet)
[09:05:30] <arschmitz> im guessing this is from when content widget was merged
[09:06:06] <uGoMobi> there is another external panel demo
[09:06:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you remove the test pages
[09:06:17] <uGoMobi> let's see if the issue occurs there too
[09:06:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *nod* ... indeed.
[09:06:21] <arschmitz> i dont see them anymore
[09:07:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you and i tested just above every possible nav path when working on these so i know it did work lol
[09:07:25] <uGoMobi> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/panels/page-a.html
[09:07:56] <uGoMobi> that one seems to work fine
[09:07:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that still works fine
[09:08:15] <uGoMobi> it uses three single pages
[09:08:39] <_|Nix|_> So what's the difference?
[09:08:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the other one is just two single pages
[09:09:30] <uGoMobi> I tested it again and now it's fine
[09:09:42] <uGoMobi> maybe it is something in demos custom JS
[09:09:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no i removed that thinking the same
[09:10:00] <uGoMobi> or did frequent reproduce it outside demos?
[09:10:08] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:11:02] <uGoMobi> somehow it works fine for me now
[09:11:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: weird
[09:11:14] <uGoMobi> but I could reproduce the first time I tested
[09:11:22] <uGoMobi> on Chrome that is
[09:12:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: weird i cant get it to work in the one frequent linked to
[09:12:06] <frequent> uGoMobi: I reproduced it in my app, too
[09:12:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but it works fine in the test page
[09:12:37] <frequent> uGoMobi: blank seems to be some overlay, because mine is black.
[09:13:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm the test page uses an external header
[09:13:12] <arschmitz> which is where the link is
[09:13:21] <arschmitz> maybe thats related
[09:15:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup thats it
[09:16:04] <arschmitz> if i make the headers inside the page it blanks 
[09:16:38] <arschmitz> so links in the page fail but links outside the page work fine

[09:19:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: somewhere we are treating links inside the page different then outside the page
[09:24:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6484 ... the OP did say it was happening on the popup demo page. I couldn't reproduce it with BS because it has no 4.3 devices ...
[09:24:47] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6484 by sebtb (8m 12s ago): Nested menu in popup jumping.
[09:25:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course, the report was pretty vague.
[09:25:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see ... (re links)
[09:26:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah im just not sure where the difference is
[09:26:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nothing i know about makes any distinction 
[09:27:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I would say a .closest( ".ui-page" ) is passing/failing somewhere ...
[09:27:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Which link are you talking about, anyway? The link that opens the panel?
[09:27:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: execpt the link binding in panel does not use that
[09:27:54] <arschmitz> yes
[09:28:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[09:28:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it seems like inside the page the return false does not work and outside it does
[09:32:23] <arschmitz> ohhhhhhh
[09:32:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the links are not being bound properly
[09:32:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Missing data-rel?
[09:32:49] <arschmitz> its not using a delegated listener
[09:32:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh.
[09:33:08] <arschmitz> so only links in the dom then the widget gets initalized are being bound to
[09:33:26] <_|Nix|_> Oh.
[09:33:28] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[09:33:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Another panel-non-dynamism ...
[09:36:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... maybe I'm on the wrong track, but _bindLinkListeners uses .on(), which should bind to future anchors as well ...
[09:37:04] <arschmitz> no it uses _on
[09:37:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not the same in this case
[09:37:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: WTF?! I see one thing in my text editor and another thing in Chrome.
[09:37:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You're right O_o
[09:38:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK ... It used to use .on().
[09:38:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was looking at an old commit.
[09:38:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok so yeah
[09:38:53] <arschmitz> i added event delegation
[09:39:04] <arschmitz> and it works perfectly
[09:39:08] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#802 (master - 010f89f : uGoMobi): The build passed.

[09:39:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[09:39:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you add event delegation while still using ._on()?
[09:40:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-_on
[09:40:39] <arschmitz> so in the first selector you use your delegated target in this case body
[09:40:51] <arschmitz> then change click to "click a"
[09:41:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Woah! Neat!
[09:44:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: overlooked this difference between on and _on when we updated that binding im guessing
[09:44:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh another thing
[09:44:59] <arschmitz> with popup
[09:45:16] <arschmitz> i think links outside the page should just work out of the box like the do with panels
[09:46:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. So you think I should fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6482 immediately?
[09:46:19] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6482 by gabrielschulhof (5h 43m ago): Popup: How to handle popups on the body
[09:46:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that should be a simple change right?
[09:47:01] <arschmitz> just changing the selector basicly?
[09:47:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, because it's a different method. if .closest( ".ui-page" ) has length 0, I will use $( "body" ).children( popupId );
[09:47:58] <arschmitz> ok
[09:48:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't want to search the entire DOM - ever. I want to restrict myself to direct descendants of body.
[09:48:16] <arschmitz> gotcha
[09:48:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If the popup is outside the page, there's only one place it can be - in the vast dark cold void between the pages.
[09:48:55] <arschmitz> not true
[09:48:59] <arschmitz> it could be in a panel
[09:49:03] <arschmitz> or a toolbar
[09:49:25] <arschmitz> because you dont move them anymore right?
[09:49:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I still move them.
[09:49:55] <arschmitz> oh ok thought we changed that 
[09:50:06] <arschmitz> so yeah that should be fine then
[09:50:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If, upon _create, I don't find a .closest( ".ui-page" ), I put 'em in the body.
[09:50:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, that has clipping implications.
[09:50:27] <arschmitz> ok
[09:50:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No amount of z-index is gonna help you if your parent is 5px by 5px.
[09:54:01] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:56:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You know, I could just use link.closest( popupID ) ...
[09:56:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you think?
[09:56:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is that very expensive?
[09:57:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: wouldnt that imply the link had to be a child of the popup?
[09:57:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I thought closest > parents.
[09:57:24] <arschmitz> it does
[09:57:39] <arschmitz> hence why the link would have to be a child
[09:57:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, if they're siblings, it would work too.
[09:58:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or, if the popup is a sibling of one of the parent.
[09:58:06] <_|Nix|_> s/
[09:58:18] <_|Nix|_> What is it with me and leaving off the "s" from plural?
[09:58:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, I suspect it would traverse way too much.
[09:59:06] <arschmitz> maybe im confused about the link we are talking about is this the link to open the popup or a link within the popup?
[09:59:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The link which causes the popup to be opened.
[09:59:37] <arschmitz> ok then link.closest would never work
[09:59:49] <arschmitz> because the link that opens the popup will never be inside the popup
[10:00:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, then I misunderstood the semantics of closest.
[10:00:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Anyway, I'm starting to think that I should search for the popup in two specific places: Immediate children of the page containing the link, and, secondly, immediate children of the body.
[10:01:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah closest only looks at parents
[10:01:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, link.parents( ":jqmData(rol='page')" ).add( "body" ).children( popupId );
[10:02:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why arnt you just using $( popupId )
[10:02:23] <arschmitz> selection by id is CRAZY fast
[10:02:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What if the link is on one page and the popup is on another page. It wouldn't show up, because the parent is hidden.
[10:03:01] <_|Nix|_> ?
[10:03:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But you're right. That would be the dev's mistake.
[10:03:26] <arschmitz> yup
[10:04:14] <arschmitz> jquery select by id can get over a million elements per second

[10:57:47] <scott_gonzalez> dam: What do you mean?
[10:58:31] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: You're not querying the DOM, so it's not *:focus.

[13:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz gnarf kborchers rxaviers tj_vantoll: This is my plan for getting rid of the "globals" for the switch to AMD: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui/compare/globals
[13:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> That's about half the files that need updates.
[13:49:23] <rxaviers> the only issue I see adding variables into objects is minification. What usually would become a small variable name now can't be minified anymore.
[13:49:52] <rxaviers> So, minified size will grow (if Im not wrong)
[13:50:19] <scott_gonzalez> gzip helps
[13:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> The only place I did a size test was on accordion.
[13:50:35] <scott_gonzalez> And the size went down.
[13:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> And I only tested the move of hideProps and showProps.
[13:51:40] <scott_gonzalez> So it wasn't unfaily helped by the use of uniqueId().
[13:53:38] <rxaviers> :)
[13:53:50] <rxaviers> dialog's change was basically the globals, that one could show something...
[13:54:05] <rxaviers> Ah ok
[13:54:09] <rxaviers> you tested it before, ok.
[13:54:13] <rxaviers> interesting
[14:04:37] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Here are numbers for the dialog change:
[14:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> with globals:
[14:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> Old version: 20109 characters
[14:04:42] <scott_gonzalez> New version: 10811 characters
[14:04:42] <scott_gonzalez> Saved: 9298 (result is 53.7% of original)
[14:05:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez omg
[14:05:24] <scott_gonzalez> without globals:
[14:05:24] <scott_gonzalez> Old version: 20116 characters
[14:05:24] <scott_gonzalez> New version: 10889 characters
[14:05:24] <scott_gonzalez> Saved: 9227 (result is 54.1% of original)
[14:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> So it went up a bit.
[14:05:40] <gnarf> oh
[14:05:44] <gnarf> lame paste
[14:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> But that's before gzip. I need to find something that does gzip as well.
[14:05:47] <gnarf> ;)
[14:06:28] <gnarf> gzip -c filename.min.js | wc -c
[14:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> I was using http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/uglifyjs
[14:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> Because apparently compare_size in UI is busted.
[14:07:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cat filename.js | uglifyjs | gzip -c | wc -c
[14:07:57] <scott_gonzalez> old: 3273, new: 3297
[14:08:06] <scott_gonzalez> So +24 for dialog
[14:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> However, there is a difference in this implementation.
[14:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> 3rd parties can now hook into the hashes.
[14:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, so this makes it possible for someone to "fix" <base> in tabs :-P
[14:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> Because isLocal() is exposed now.
[14:11:20] <rxaviers> thanks for the numbers
[14:13:03] <rxaviers> doesnt seem bad
[14:23:40] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, another thing brought my attention. I saw that most of the previous private functions now became exposed in the widget prototype. But, for $.ui.intersect you wrapped it with a func. I am just curious why you didnt do something like for isOverAxis -> prototype._isOverAxis
[14:25:46] <scott_gonzalez> Because it was only used in one function.
[14:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> And it was super tiny.
[14:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> aw crap
[14:32:51] <rxaviers> ok. all from my side. This new way, more functions and variables are exposed in the prototype with underlined name. But, I guess that's no big deal since we had private functions set this way before.
[14:33:04] <rxaviers> Another approach would be name globals following a certain rule, like dialogXxx, accordionXXx. Not that I am inclined to it, just raising...
[14:33:27] <rxaviers> (In this new way,)*
[14:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> Well, r.js wouldn't be able to handle combining UI + 3rd party files that happen to use the same variable name, right?
[14:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> Like if we had core_foo and someone else had core_foo.
[14:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> Or does r.js not normally strip?
[14:36:01] <scott_gonzalez> And just concat?
[14:36:36] <rxaviers> that problem is only an issue due to our own customization of r.js
[14:36:54] <rxaviers> normally, each define is kept. So, globals dont clash
[14:37:05] <rxaviers> I mean globals are actually locals hehe
[14:37:07] <rxaviers> normally
[14:37:21] <rxaviers> (we strip the define functions in our custom setup)
[14:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I might switch some to just use prefixed "globals" when I get back to this.
[14:39:47] <rxaviers> ok ;)
[14:42:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[14:43:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Pong!
[14:44:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[14:44:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If my select-by-id returns an element that is not a popup widget, should I change it so it instantiates a popup widget on it?
[14:45:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That way you could do popup-outside-page without having to instantiate it yourself, as long as you have an <a data-rel="popup" ... > pointing at it.
[14:45:55] <arschmitz> hmmm
[14:46:28] <arschmitz> the main reason im inclined to say dont do this is it could get confusing
[14:46:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, and no startup costs incurred either.
[14:46:37] <arschmitz> because panel does not work like that
[14:47:10] <arschmitz> and no other widget outside a page will self initalize like that
[14:47:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... this would walk popup down the page-like path.
[14:48:18] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:48:40] <_|Nix|_> OK. WORKSFORME.
[14:49:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: would also fail to work once we factor out nav
[14:50:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ha! This link-finds-popup-everywhere doesn't really reduce the code in the popup-outside-page-demo *smile* ... The code goes from $( "#popup-outside-page" ).enhanceWithin().popup() to $( "#popup-outside-page" ).enhanceWithin()
[14:50:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You still need to enhanceWithin() because it contains a listview ...
[14:51:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, even if I were to implement the auto-instantiate-popup, it wouldn't really save that much.
[14:51:33] <arschmitz> yup
[14:58:56] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Ping!

[15:10:17] <lonejack> Hi to all, need some help on datepicker understanding. I tried to study datepeeker for my personal knowledge but something obscure remain...
[15:11:29] <lonejack> Inside plugin definition: $.fn.datepicker = function(options){...} i see this: if (typeof options === "string" && (options === "isDisabled"....->return $.datepicker["_" + options + "Datepicker"].
[15:11:29] <lonejack> 			apply($.datepicker, [this[0]].concat(otherArgs));
[15:13:31] <lonejack> Please, can anyone tell me why I see:  $.datepicker["_" + options + "Datepicker"].... -> probably will call (for example) the function "_isDisabledDatepicker"
[15:13:51] <lonejack> But is a member of an object..
[15:14:20] <lonejack> $.datepicker["_" + options + "Datepicker"] access as an array...
[15:14:23] <lonejack> Thank you
[15:17:03] <lonejack> don't answer. resolved
[15:17:12] <lonejack> thank you
[15:23:22] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: I'm back.

[15:28:36] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Hey!
[15:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> Hey _|Nix|_.
[15:29:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I've noticed that, if you have an object-valued property in your widget  prototype, it gets copied by reference to all instances.
[15:29:25] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[15:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> That's how prototypes work.
[15:29:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: This is an excellent mechanism for getting widget instances to share state, should they need to do so.
[15:30:17] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Or would using this like that be a no-no?
[15:31:01] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: IOW, widget factory reserves the right to no longer copy objects by ref like that without any deprecation period.
[15:31:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... making that a no-no.
[15:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> I doubt we'll ever change this.
[15:32:00] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK. Sounds good.
[15:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> But why wouldn't you just put the shared state on the constructor?
[15:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> What shared state do you have?
[15:32:55] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Because it's private, and you don't need to access it via $.ns.widgetName.variable.
[15:33:02] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, private-er.
[15:33:24] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I don't have any, because only now did I realize that this might be a nice, clean place to store some.
[15:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> Umm...the prototype is definitely not any more private than the constructor.
[15:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> But the name for accessing I can understand.
[15:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> We generally just put shared state completely outside of the widget.
[15:35:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I know neither offers real privacy, however, we actively discourage people retrieving the widget data, whereas we say nothing about touching the proto.
[15:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> what?
[15:35:48] <scott_gonzalez> "we actively discourage people retrieving the widget data" what does that mean?
[15:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> If you're talking about .data( "ns-widget" ) we definitely do not discourage that.
[15:36:25] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK. I had the wrong impression then.
[15:36:41] <scott_gonzalez> There's no reason to think that the prototype is open to the world and the instance is closed to the world.
[15:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> That wouldn't make any sense.
[15:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> They're both fully open.
[15:37:05] <scott_gonzalez> However, there's a difference between puclic API and private API.
[15:37:30] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, this would definitely be private.
[15:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> With no actual examples of what state you want to share, it's extremely hard to discuss.
[15:38:20] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... or I might just leave things the way they are now.
[15:38:47] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, the idea would be to avoid having every instance of popup set up a click handler on the document.
[15:39:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Instead, the first one sets up the handler, and the subsequent ones simply push their instance object into a hash keyed on their ID.
[15:39:52] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, like, this._sharedListOfPopups[ this.element.attr( "id" ) ] = this;
[15:40:34] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Then, the one handler can know if the link's href refers to a valid popup or not, without having to do any selection.
[15:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> You actually don't want to do that.
[15:41:23] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Right now the click handler selects the popup by ID and checks whether it has a .data( "mobile-popup" )
[15:41:35] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Why not? (Just curious)
[15:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> Because you can't use ._on() for a shared event handler.
[15:42:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, I don't use ._on() right now, either, because I attach the handler outside the $.widget(); call.
[15:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> And that code is probably saner than what you'll do if you move it into the widget.
[15:44:33] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Wait a sec - I could go about this the other way: this._on( this.document, { "click a[href='#" + this.element.attr( "id" ) + "']:jqmData(rel='popup')": "_handleLinkClick" } );
[15:44:58] <scott_gonzalez> If you want several event handlers.
[15:45:20] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, yeah ... I'd still have one per popup :/
[15:46:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I dunno ... maybe it's not worth trying to save on handlers - I don't really know how expensive they are, but on an average demo page you can have as many as, like, 15 popups.
[15:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we have this right now: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L734-L737
[15:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> Which is wrong.
[15:46:39] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you'd be adding overhead to every single click on the entire site/app.
[15:47:23] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... which is why we really need to make our click routing pluggable.
[15:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really understand why you'd be binding to the document for this.
[15:48:05] <scott_gonzalez> You already know the element you want to listen to.
[15:48:32] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Pages may get AJAX-ed in, in which case I need a delegated handler.
[15:48:39] <scott_gonzalez> No you don't.
[15:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> Or your example was wrong.
[15:48:54] <scott_gonzalez> You can't do this.element.attr( "id" ) and have it be dynamic.
[15:49:03] <scott_gonzalez> Either you have the element or you don't.
[15:49:11] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see.
[15:49:11] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The element is the popup.
[15:49:26] <scott_gonzalez> That's honestly kind of strange.
[15:49:41] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, many links, now and future ones can point to a single popup.
[15:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> And those links should say that they're popups.
[15:49:58] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Just look at a link that opens a global nav menu stored in a popup.
[15:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> And according to that selector, they do.
[15:50:14] <scott_gonzalez> So I don't know why you'd be binding event handlers specific to the individual popups.
[15:50:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: They do: <a href="#the-global-popup" data-rel="popup"...>...</a>
[15:50:23] <scott_gonzalez> I have to go.
[15:50:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK.
[15:50:36] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: L8R
[15:50:48] <scott_gonzalez> [data-rel="popup"] is all you care about. Go from there.
[16:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: I'm back for about 15 minutes.
[16:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> Got time for a quick Skype call?
[16:20:00] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Hold on ... need to close the door - everyone's sleeping.
