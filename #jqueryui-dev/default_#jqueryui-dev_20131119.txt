[06:07:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Ping!
[06:08:05] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[06:08:10] <uGoMobi> also hey _|Nix|_ 
[06:08:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: got 2 quick things for you.
[06:08:27] <uGoMobi> sure
[06:10:43] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15arschmitz pushed 1 new commit to 06datepicker-demo: 02http://git.io/JSMZxA
[06:10:43] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06datepicker-demo 146f437ba 15Alexander Schmitz: Demos: add missing file for datepicker demo
[06:10:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: first what you think of this demo http://view.jquerymobile.com/datepicker-demo/demos/icons-grunticon/
[06:11:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if you get png's the eye looks all pixelated and it says pixels make me sad lol
[06:12:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: wow that looks cool
[06:13:03] <arschmitz> awesome
[06:13:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: datepicker-demo repo? (just checking)
[06:13:50] <arschmitz> yeah thats another one i wanted you to look at it will just be a minute before view updates
[06:13:59] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[06:14:08] <arschmitz> mean while though we had a request for a demo of this http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/897/edit
[06:14:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: one very minor thing... I would change the text for the link to "the GitHub repo" instead of the full url (https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon)
[06:15:26] <arschmitz> thats fine i always use full urls for stuff like that but makes no difference to me really
[06:15:57] <arschmitz> controlgroups with textinputs seems like it might be worth supporting since its really simple to do 
[06:16:34] <arschmitz> maybe when i rewrite for ul ill look at adding it since that will likely be pretty soon
[06:18:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm, I am not sure yet about that
[06:18:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: whys that?
[06:18:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: textinput will never get button classes
[06:18:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so I wonder if we have to make exceptions
[06:19:00] <arschmitz> in this case why cant it its just style?
[06:19:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it's just that in general we have to support things that might limit us in the future to simplify a widget
[06:20:11] <arschmitz> it formats the textinput perfectly other then padding
[06:20:33] <arschmitz> i mean we could make a new class just for textinputs
[06:20:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am not saying we shouldn't do it
[06:20:53] <arschmitz> that has the same rules as ui-btn for controlgroups
[06:23:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and here is datepicker demo
[06:23:16] <arschmitz> http://view.jquerymobile.com/datepicker-demo/demos/datepicker/
[06:23:37] <arschmitz> just a demo to show how to use datepicker until re-write is ready
[06:24:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that date picker demo looks really neat
[06:25:08] <arschmitz> cool
[06:25:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I have seen that JS Bin you made before but now with 1.4 theme it looks really cool
[06:25:31] <arschmitz> yeah cleans it up nice
[06:25:38] <arschmitz> gives it a really modern look
[06:25:52] <uGoMobi> yeah awesome
[06:26:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: let's talk with UI guys about textinput in controlgroups
[06:26:20] <arschmitz> so i think im going to add that and the textinputs in controlgroups demos
[06:26:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i was just going to add it as an example to controlgroups page for now
[06:26:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I like how it looks, but not sure if it's wise to support it, but maybe I see problems that are not there
[06:26:53] <arschmitz> and discuss it as far as official support once i started work on controlgroup
[06:27:22] <uGoMobi> cool
[06:28:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so other then the demos landing page the main repo is all set
[06:28:28] <uGoMobi> awesome

[08:05:13] <gseguin> mornin'
[08:06:57] <arschmitz> gseguin: morning
[08:10:54] <gseguin> arschmitz: did you see that the no-prefix branch passes tests?
[08:11:02] <arschmitz> gseguin: yes
[08:11:16] <arschmitz> gseguin: that will have to wait until after final though 
[08:11:25] <gseguin> yeah that's what I thought
[08:11:37] <gseguin> I was in rebase hell yesterday
[08:11:43] <arschmitz> gseguin: uGoMobi and i talked about it a while back and dont want to make any structure changes last minute bit us in the but doing that for 1.3
[08:11:55] <arschmitz> gseguin: speaking of that...
[08:12:12] <arschmitz> gseguin: that branch will need more rebasing before it was merged
[08:12:24] <gseguin> good luck with that ;)
[08:12:25] <arschmitz> most of the commits could be squashed
[08:12:41] <gseguin> oh yeah the commits on that branch
[08:12:45] <arschmitz> and there are reverts in there which just increase the repo size for no reason
[08:13:12] <gseguin> but I was trying to rebase master on it and hit all sorts of conflicts
[08:13:17] <gseguin> I gave up
[08:13:36] <arschmitz> you could probably squash the commits in the branch down to like 2 or 3 one for files system 1 for tests is really all it "needs"
[08:14:27] <arschmitz> its obviously something we want to land though
[08:15:17] <arschmitz> gseguin: i was wondering if we should maybe change the directory structure at the same time as we land the no prefix though? we need to make it match the ui structure
[08:16:37] <gseguin> why not
[08:16:42] <gseguin> we might as well
[08:16:57] <gseguin> we should also get rid of the prefixes in the css files
[08:20:34] <_zoggy_> https://github.com/jquery-orphans/jquery-metadata
[08:20:52] <_zoggy_> that used to be on the plugins page.. but obviously because of the 2011 disaster.. its no longer there
[08:21:27] <_zoggy_> anyone happen to know where the docs for it might be at... 
[08:35:42] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: Internet Archive?
[08:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> Or in the source code comments...
[08:40:57] <_zoggy_> hmm not a whole lot of info on the pages (internet archive version)
[08:45:26] <scott_gonzalez> Why do you want to use metadata anyway?

[09:01:42] <arschmitz> agcolom: no problem im just going through issues right now trying to clean them up a bit
[09:02:54] <agcolom> arschmitz: any idea when 1.4 will be out (no rush, just so I know if asked ;-) )
[09:03:25] <arschmitz> not really the main thing waiting right now is theme roller and a few website updates ( but nothing major )
[09:03:38] <arschmitz> so its all about when ever themeroller is finished i think
[09:03:54] <agcolom> ok great! Thanks :-)
