[13:02:16] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez ^ ?

[13:03:18] <agcolom> no John Derp?
[13:03:53] <agcolom> (never seen this name before) so not sure that's a jquery guy??
[13:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I missed that. I wasn't online.
[13:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> I just muted the channel.
[13:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> Definitely just some random guy.
