[06:57:25] <mikesherov> sorry about that :-\
[06:58:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: WTF?
[06:58:46] <scott_gonzalez> This isn't even new.
[06:58:48] <scott_gonzalez> We've had this for years.
[06:59:02] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: apparently they handpicked CSS lines?
[06:59:56] <scott_gonzalez> They should be loading ui.core and ui.{widget}.
[07:00:13] <scott_gonzalez> But if they want to manually copy lines, that's up to them.
[07:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's silly that they think there's a massive amount of overhead.
[07:00:42] <scott_gonzalez> I also think it's annoying that nobody talks to upstream projects.
[07:01:35] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Landing that now.

[07:54:22] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: tracking down the last of the fails now. Should have fixes for all soon.
[07:56:34] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: nice! especially if you manage to fix that position test...
[07:56:47] <jzaefferer> that's been haunting us for a while now
[07:57:16] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: I finally got testswarm/browserstack tunneling working on my comp yesterday

[08:08:17] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: let's see if that helps: http://drupal.org/node/1827626#comment-6672476 - generally that google alert for "jquery ui" turned out to be pretty useful
[08:08:33] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: how did you do the tunneling?
[09:06:13] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i know scott is out. meeting today?
[09:10:30] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers - due to async DST change between here and germany its an hour earlier then usual, so I'm busy elsewhere :/
[09:11:13] <kborchers> jzaefferer: no prob .. just wait till next week?
[09:12:02] <kborchers> i'll probably be around in an hour if you want to go over anything then too. either way works for me
[09:12:49] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I wonder who did that agenda for today
[09:12:58] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: no meeting today?
[09:13:11] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: did you put "Handling CSS Transforms?" in there?
[09:13:18] <mikesherov> um, yes
[09:13:29] <mikesherov> Just a general question I had
[09:13:50] <mikesherov> it's probably an insane thing to start supporting, but there were a few tickets in the tracker about it
[09:13:52] <jzaefferer> Let's discuss that with Scott when he's available again
[09:13:56] <mikesherov> K
[09:14:16] <jzaefferer> Download builder has to wait for Rafael to return
[09:14:24] <jzaefferer> Once he makes it back from his honeymoon
[09:14:40] <jzaefferer> I'm working on dialog and sites
[09:14:58] <jzaefferer> gnarf mikesherov: any update on email notifications for GitHub wikis?
[09:15:16] <jzaefferer> thats the only open issue from last week that I'd like to get an update on
[09:15:24] <mikesherov> yeah, so, still blocked on mergeatron
[09:15:38] <mikesherov> but something I'm actively working towards
[09:16:11] <jzaefferer> speaking of mergatron, what's the status of that?
[09:17:53] <mikesherov> In progress
[09:18:10] <mikesherov> it works just fine with mongo, I am still abstracting out the db to use sqlite
[09:19:32] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:19:51] <jzaefferer> so how is mergatron related to wiki notifications?
[09:20:57] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: also, how many "new" tickets are left?
[09:21:18] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: I don't know if it is, maybe I'm confused
[09:21:53] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?status=new&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=version&report=19&order=id
[09:21:55] <mikesherov> 173
[09:22:13] <mikesherov> if we only count bugs: 133
[09:22:20] <mikesherov> that means 40 "new" feature tixx
[09:22:26] <mikesherov> which I def need help on
[09:22:35] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: ^
[09:23:01] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:23:02] <jzaefferer> thanks
[09:25:36] <jzaefferer> mikesherov kborchers gnarf: Am I missing something? https://gist.github.com/696b0263bdf1c13ba2c8
[09:26:45] <mikesherov> no
[09:26:47] <kborchers> jzaefferer: not that i know of
[09:27:04] <jzaefferer> kborchers: progressbar?
[09:27:10] <jzaefferer> what's the status there?
[09:27:27] <mikesherov> I need help triaging the "new features"
[09:27:35] <mikesherov> can someone do that?
[09:27:43] <mikesherov> just those 40 tixx
[09:27:56] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: is there a report for that? I can start looking into it
[09:28:31] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?status=new&type=feature&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority
[09:28:51] <mikesherov> actually, this is better: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?status=new&type=feature&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority
[09:29:04] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i think i missed todd's last comment ‚Ä¶ i should be able to get that updated today or tomorrow
[09:29:04] <jzaefferer> kborchers: PROGRESSBAR STATUS?
[09:29:08] <jzaefferer> opps
[09:29:11] <kborchers> :)
[09:29:13] <jzaefferer> there you are!
[09:29:33] <kborchers> oh
[09:29:40] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i have an issue with his solution
[09:29:58] <kborchers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/738#issuecomment-9784383
[09:30:08] <jzaefferer> I'll just write "Progress on progressbar redesign"
[09:30:24] <jzaefferer> orr something less redundant?
[09:30:39] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i think that's fine
[09:30:49] <jzaefferer> "Progressbar: Making progress on indeterminate progressbar redesign"
[09:30:55] <jzaefferer>  /o\
[09:31:05] <jzaefferer> progressbar progressbar progressbar progressbar
[09:31:26] <kborchers> solid black/white over the bar with opacity will make the color not be the expected color from the theme since it will be "whiter" or "blacker" which is why i went with my solution ‚Ä¶ thoughts jzaefferer ?
[09:31:54] <kborchers> also, the grey i don't think will work with a grey theme. not enough contrast
[09:33:12] <jzaefferer> kborchers: don't ask, please discuss that with Todd or Mat :-)
[09:33:16] <jzaefferer> *don't ask me
[09:33:33] <kborchers> FINE, I WILL!
[09:33:34] <kborchers> :P
[09:37:58] <jzaefferer> hehe
[09:37:59] <jzaefferer> goodie
[09:38:14] <jzaefferer> I've sent that list to Scott, he can edit and post it to jquery.org/updates
[09:39:06] <jzaefferer> kborchers: can you add the details you wrote above to your comment?
[09:40:15] <kborchers> yep
[09:42:34] <jzaefferer> kborchers: good. Editing it into your previous comment would've been nice, but that'll do :-)
[09:43:17] <jzaefferer> toddmparker toddmparker__: despite you being busy compressing and blurring large images in photoshop, would really appreciate to get your input again on this progressbar issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/738#issuecomment-9951893
[09:43:18] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i wasn't sure if that would send a notification and i wanted to make sure it was seen, specifically by todd so i didn't edit the previous.
[09:43:28] <jzaefferer> kborchers: that makes sense
[09:43:36] <jzaefferer> one big drawback of email notifications
[09:43:39] <jzaefferer> edits are invisible
[09:43:44] <kborchers> yeah
[10:00:56] <_|Nix|_> Hi! Will this.widgetName cease to be part of the widget definition anytime soon? Is it deprecated or otherwise on its way out?
[10:01:00] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ^
[11:38:13] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: no, widgetName will stay, along with widgetFullName; widgetBaseClass is going away
[12:20:11] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Awesome, thanks!
[13:18:15] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I couldn't find any tickets related to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11795 in effects
[13:18:32] <mikesherov> there is this though: -) https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/864
[16:28:53] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Hmm...ok, maybe they were closed already.
[17:26:39] <mikesherov> ?ping
[17:26:40] <bot-t> mikesherov: pong!
[18:16:23] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[18:16:30] <scott_gonzalez> hey mikesherov
[18:16:56] <mikesherov> So, the .simulate() stuff in the UI test suite
[18:17:16] <mikesherov> is all of that supposed to work in IE7? I'm getting some weird test failures
[18:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's supposed to work, but the code is sorta busted.
[18:18:26] <mikesherov> OK, weird
[18:18:29] <mikesherov> the other question I had was about events
[18:18:57] <mikesherov> so interaction events have (e, ui) as params to the callback
[18:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> I did some research into KeyEvent vs. KeyboardEvent for the cleanup of .simulate(): http://dev-test.code.dev/keyboard-events/
[18:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> errr....that won't work for you.
[18:19:25] <mikesherov> are all of the events supposed to have ui.position defined?
[18:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> http://dev-test.nemikor.com/keyboard-events/
[18:20:37] <scott_gonzalez> I believe so.
[18:20:43] <mikesherov> I'm getting weird IE7 test failures where ui.helper is not defined
[18:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> For which plugin?
[18:27:31] <tjvantoll> There should be some disclaimer that resizable's alsoResize option doesn't play nice with other options :).  There are bugs for alsoResize with‚Ä¶
[18:27:31] <tjvantoll> containment (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4603)
[18:27:31] <tjvantoll> animate (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5422)
[18:27:31] <tjvantoll> helper (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6860)
[18:27:32] <tjvantoll> grid (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8171)
[18:27:32] <tjvantoll> minWidth & maxWidth (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/81717002)
[18:27:33] <tjvantoll> and possibly others.
[18:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> whoa, ticket 81717002? WHEN DID WE GET SO MANY?!? :-P
[18:28:31] <tjvantoll> Whoops
[18:28:34] <tjvantoll> 7002 :)
[18:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> In all seriousness, alsoResize is just busted. It needs to be the last thing that happens and it should respect all types of constraints.
[18:29:43] <tjvantoll> Yeah a lot of the test cases for those are dead simple too.  It doesn't take much of anything to bust it.
[18:35:24] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8761
[18:35:28] <scott_gonzalez> Is that legit?
[18:35:36] <tjvantoll> I was just looking at that.
[18:35:47] <scott_gonzalez> I call BS markup.
[18:36:08] <tjvantoll> Agreed.
[18:37:34] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: thoughts? ^
[18:38:10] <scott_gonzalez> I've never heard of someone doing this before.
[18:38:15] <tjvantoll> I can see how that might be useful.  You want the styled buttons but onchange you just toss the value in the hidden field and get the same name value pair tossed to the server.
[18:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> Also, it's bad practive to have radios with nothing selected on load.
[18:38:34] <DaveMethvin> BUTTONS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY GOOD DAY SIR!
[18:39:08] <scott_gonzalez> Any objects to wontfix?
[18:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> s/objects/objections/
[18:39:29] <tjvantoll> I agree with wontfix.
[18:39:31] <DaveMethvin> nope
[18:39:35] <DaveMethvin> no objecttion
[18:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> closed
[18:42:56] <scott_gonzalez> ...as I almost pass out from blowing up balloons.
[18:43:04] <scott_gonzalez> Dylan turns 3 tomorrow :-)
[18:43:21] <DaveMethvin> awwww
[18:43:56] <DaveMethvin> between halloween candy and birthday cake, it's sugar overload season!
[18:44:14] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, normally, but no trick-or-treating this year.
[18:44:31] <scott_gonzalez> We're in Sanibel Island, FL.
[18:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> Not much around here.
[18:44:57] <DaveMethvin> really nice place tho for just relaxing
[18:45:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, we took out a boat for 4 hours this afternoon. The kids loved it.
[18:45:43] <DaveMethvin> a lot better than cleaning up after hurricane damage, i tellya
[18:46:03] <scott_gonzalez> We've been watching the news coverage. It's pretty crazy.
[18:46:35] <DaveMethvin> everything south of Philly got off pretty easy compared to NJ and NYC
[18:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> My parents and my brother both lost power. My brother can't even get through his neighborhood because of fallen trees.
[18:46:51] <DaveMethvin> the NJ shore is just obliterated
[18:47:20] <DaveMethvin> i was supposed to teach a class in NYC next week and it's been cancelled
[18:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> My parents have 7 trees down in their yard and the power lines were ripped off their house.
[18:48:37] <scott_gonzalez> Luckily after the lost power, so no sparks/fire.
[18:48:40] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[18:48:52] <DaveMethvin> i guess you guys still had leaves on the trees?
[18:48:59] <DaveMethvin> most of ours had fallen off
[18:49:14] <DaveMethvin> now they're a soggy 5-inch layer covering our yard
[18:49:25] <DaveMethvin> no way a leaf blower is moving them
[18:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the picture my dad sent me of the power lines had a huge pile of leaves on the ground.
[18:58:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: responded on github ‚Ä¶ forgot about damn themes with stripes
[18:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: responded
[18:59:38] <kborchers> cool
[18:59:59] <scott_gonzalez> It's so frustrating that the things that should be easy are always the hardest.
[19:00:39] <kborchers> yep ‚Ä¶ i was like "Sure, i'll take progressbar. i can knock that out in an hour ‚Ä¶"  Weeks later ‚Ä¶ :/
[19:01:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: btw, don't remember if i told you but got my xbox controller demo working good enough for the talk :)
[19:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, you told me :-) Sounds interesting.
[19:02:48] <kborchers> linux/xboxdrv -> nodejs/joystick -> socket.io -> custom events caught by interaction hooks
[19:04:27] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: basically just duplicated the mouse hooks and swapped out the mouse events with custom events i'm generating from data sent over the socket
[19:07:05] <kborchers> i wish the gamepad api would work but probably doesn't like the fact that it's a hacked controller that i cut the connector off of and attached a usb connector :)  mac just sees it as an unidentified usb device
[19:08:41] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[19:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: So that button craziness is from CakePHP.
[19:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that means nobody uses Cake + UI buttons?
[19:09:34] <DaveMethvin> i guess
[19:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> I told him to ask Cake to change :-P
[19:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> Or get a Cake dev to argue for us to change.
[19:10:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i just think that markup is screwy
[19:11:11] <scott_gonzalez> It definitely is.
[19:11:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, end of the month, time for me to generate a list of commits across dozens of repos..
[19:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> I really need to write a script for this.
[19:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, when I switch to a Foundation contract in a few months, I won't need to do this insanity any more.

[21:33:23] <kborchers> :)
