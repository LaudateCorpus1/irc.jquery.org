[05:08:13] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06master 140d4022b 15Mike Sherov: Tests: Convert single quotes to double quotes.
[05:18:29] <petro> mikesherov, you on?
[05:18:46] <mikesherov> petro: yo
[05:19:39] <petro> i finished most of the clip rewrite :), just edge cases and tests to go
[05:20:29] <mikesherov> really? link to branch?
[05:20:34] <petro> although there is one painful wrinkleâ€¦. webkit getcomputedstyle returns the wrong value for clip "auto" values
[05:20:38] <petro> https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20454
[05:20:51] <petro> no activity since 2011 :-\
[05:22:15] <mikesherov> Yeah, but you should post on that bug mentioning your use case and advocating for it
[05:22:50] <mikesherov> long standing bugs get traction when a valid use case in a large library is advocated for.
[05:23:14] <petro> yep, will do
[05:24:21] <mikesherov> jarred Nicholls is usually pretty responsive to bugs in gCS
[05:24:23] <mikesherov> https://bugs.webkit.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&long_desc_type=substring&long_desc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&keywords_type=allwords&keywords=&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&bug_status=CLOSED&emailassigned_to1=1&emailreporter1=1&emailcc1=1&emaillongdesc1=1&em

[05:25:53] <petro> are they using trac too? painfully slow haha
[05:26:13] <mikesherov> Trac and bugzilla
[05:26:57] <mikesherov> petro: why is that Webkit bug blocking you though?
[05:28:19] <petro> there's no way to distinguish between "auto" and 0px values when i'm animating from the original author-specified clip value to the animation end value
[05:28:31] <petro> i'm pushing my branch now, so you can see
[05:29:27] <mikesherov> a workaround you may want to consider is falling back to <Node>.style.clip instead of getComputedStyle(<Node>, null).clip when you hit that edge caseâ€¦ .style.clip will give you the inline style value, which may resolve the issue
[05:32:17] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI 1-9-stable - 1.6.x core build #40: FAILURE in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%201.6.x%20core/40/
[05:34:07] <petro> only the inline style value?
[05:35:29] <mikesherov> petro, yes
[05:35:41] <mikesherov> this is the problem with getComputedStyleâ€¦ it's a jerk
[05:35:58] <mikesherov> querying CSS info is painfully gimped
[05:36:50] <mikesherov> you only have the choice of "validated specified inline value" with .style, or "validated resolved value" with getComputedStyle
[05:36:51] <petro> https://github.com/mpetrovich/jquery-ui/compare/clip
[05:37:17] <petro> yeah that's pretty limiting, especially when the "computed" style isn't consistent
[05:37:38] <petro> ^ that branch is a work in progress, still working out some bugs when margins are present
[05:38:12] <petro> for non-image elements, animating clip isn't very fluid
[05:40:25] <petro> nvm that last comment, that webkit bugtracker was hogging my cpu
[05:40:38] <mikesherov> so, a couple of notesâ€¦ that webkit bug isn't in your way
[05:41:01] <mikesherov> here's whyâ€¦ before the animation, just store <Node>.style.clip in a var
[05:41:11] <mikesherov> and then set it back to that at the end of the animatin
[05:41:23] <mikesherov> in 99% of cases, it's empty string anyway
[05:41:38] <petro> restoring the original clip value isn't the issue
[05:41:49] <petro> $.effects.save() takes care of that
[05:42:08] <mikesherov> ok...
[05:42:22] <mikesherov> it's detecting what the real initial values are for the object...
[05:42:23] <mikesherov> got it
[05:42:24] <petro> it's line 35, start = { â€¦ }
[05:42:57] <petro> for bottom & right, "auto" actually means height() & width()
[05:43:08] <mikesherov> right
[05:43:40] <petro> in terms of general approach, what do you think?
[05:44:26] <mikesherov> Pretty good!
[05:45:06] <mikesherov> I would say instead of animating {a:0} to {a:1}, you can just directly animate `start` to `end`
[05:45:15] <mikesherov> so you don't need to compute delta
[05:45:27] <mikesherov> that's what animate does for you!
[05:45:33] <petro> oh lol
[05:45:36] <petro> great point
[05:45:45] <mikesherov> your step function can then just do the .css line
[05:45:55] <petro> \/facepalm
[05:46:29] <mikesherov> :-P
[05:47:17] <petro> beautiful, that works perfectly
[05:47:47] <mikesherov> also, it's easier to reverse the conditional for display detection
[05:47:48] <petro> i could also save some bytes by converting start & end to arrays instead of objects
[05:48:03] <mikesherov> where you check for specific block displays instead of the reverse
[05:48:40] <petro> you sure? http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-box/#block-level-boxes-containing-blocks-flow
[05:52:09] <petro> after reading more into the docs, "compact" is usually block
[05:52:35] <mikesherov> good point, but compact and run-in should be removed
[05:53:32] <mikesherov> and on top of that, you can do a regex for /inline|ruby/
[05:53:33] <mikesherov> smaller and faster
[05:54:08] <petro> regex faster than 3 comparisons?
[06:01:49] <petro> http://jsperf.com/regexp-test-search-vs-indexof/12
[06:01:59] <petro> i was curious :D
[06:10:39] <rxaviers> team, 1.10 has different files than previous versions. I am changing builder unit test to handle that differences since we'll be serving 1.9 and 1.10. When we begin to serve stable and legacy with the same file structure we can simplify unit test back. If you think we should not add this complexity right now, please advise.
