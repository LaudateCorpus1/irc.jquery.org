[13:11:01] <gseguin> arschmitz: thanks for looking into these PR
[13:11:10] <arschmitz> gseguin: no problem
[13:11:16] <gseguin> arschmitz: I had a question for you guys
[13:11:27] <gseguin> why is the widget registry in the page widget
[13:11:29] <gseguin> ?
[13:11:29] <arschmitz> also if your ever held up by me reviewing feel free to ping me
[13:11:50] <arschmitz> because autoinit which is what its for is part of the page model
[13:11:57] <arschmitz> with out pages it does not happen
[13:12:29] <gseguin> it makes it a bit difficult to use the modules as such
[13:12:43] <arschmitz> gseguin: in what way exactly?
[13:12:51] <gseguin> because one needs to know to make sure page is loaded before any other widget
[13:13:06] <gseguin> because otherwise they don't register into the registry
[13:13:17] <arschmitz> yes if your using pages it should always be first
[13:13:22] <gseguin> and the enhanceWithin misses these widgets in the page
[13:13:59] <gseguin> shouldn't this be enforced by way of dependency?
[13:14:13] <gseguin> (if at all possible)
[13:15:09] <arschmitz> the problem is its a 2 way dependency page depends on it and it depends on page because its useless without
[13:16:11] <arschmitz> @gseguin im not sure how you would express that with AMD 
[13:16:18] <arschmitz> gseguin: ^^ i mean 
[13:17:13] <gseguin> yeah I haven't looked into it too much, I'll try to think about it
[13:17:25] <arschmitz> gseguin: sure im open to suggestions 
[13:17:25] <gseguin> just wanted to know what the rationale was.
[13:18:06] <arschmitz> gseguin: sure

[13:55:37] <gseguin> arschmitz: is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6369 still current?
[13:55:52] <gseguin> arschmitz, uGoMobi: want this fixed for 1.4.1?
[13:58:55] <gseguin> arschmitz: I can set up the dependencies in bower.json and use: https://github.com/timmywil/grunt-bowercopy to copy them to their final destination before committing them
[13:59:19] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: what's your opinion on this: ^
[13:59:22] <arschmitz> gseguin: i think we should wait for 1.5 for that
[13:59:39] <arschmitz> gseguin: its not really a maintenance thing 
[13:59:45] <gseguin> arschmitz: why?
[14:00:24] <arschmitz> gseguin: maintenance releases are really for fixing bugs this is not a bug its something new
[14:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> It's internal infrastructure. It can happen during a patch release.
[14:01:20] <gseguin> yeah it's not really a code change
[14:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> So long as you don't anticipate large problems. I wouldn't expect switching to Bower would cause unexpected issues.
[14:01:36] <gseguin> it's just the way we handle dependencies
[14:01:59] <arschmitz> true yeah im fine with it then
[14:02:26] <gseguin> what about publishing to bower?
[14:02:34] <gseguin> can we publish 2 versions?
[14:02:54] <gseguin> one being the monolithic file, the other, the AMD version?
[14:03:29] <gseguin> like jquery-mobile and jquery-mobile-modules (open to naming suggestions)
[14:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> I think the decision was that we only publish individual files.
[14:03:48] <arschmitz> yes thats correct
[14:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> The user then picks the necessary parts and concats/minifies on their own using some build system, e.g. r.js.
[14:04:28] <gseguin> I just worked on  a project where I used the micro modules and it's super convenient to build your custom version of jQM as part of your project
[14:04:50] <gseguin> oh ok so only the AMD version, right?
[14:04:55] <arschmitz> right
[14:05:05] <gseguin> I thought you were saying the opposite
[14:05:36] <arschmitz> no basicly we want the git version not the build one so they can do a custom build
[14:05:37] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I like that for my use but what about the less advanced user?
[14:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> They won't use Bower.
[14:05:56] <arschmitz> gseguin: do you really think the less advanced user will use bower
[14:06:02] <arschmitz> yeah what scott_gonzalez said lol
[14:06:50] <gseguin> I'm fine with that it's less work. However I don't want to leave anyone out.
[14:07:26] <arschmitz> gseguin: this is what was decided when it was discussed at dev leads meeting also
[14:07:34] <gseguin> ok, cool
[14:07:44] <scott_gonzalez> Well, in that case, make sure you start managing gem bundles, NuGet packages, TypeScript files, etc. :-P
[14:07:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: i have to run to pick my son up but ill be back a little later
[14:08:00] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: hey now! ;)
[14:08:01] <arschmitz> lol
[14:08:10] <gseguin> arschmitz: ok
[14:08:26] <gseguin> Are other projects going to publish to bower too?
[14:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[14:08:44] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: is the publishing part going to be part of jquery-release?
[14:09:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: mobile is already on bower
[14:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Check out https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/pull/18
[14:09:17] <gseguin> yes indeed
[14:09:29] <arschmitz> gseguin: we are just not using it to manage our own deps yet
