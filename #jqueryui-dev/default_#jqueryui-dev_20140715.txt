[02:13:05] <Omar-> hello
[02:21:19] <Omar-> Hello!
[03:04:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Ping!
[03:04:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What's up?
[03:04:45] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We're on #web-ui-fw
[03:05:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We'll move to #jquery-meeting if we need a meeting.
[03:05:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i just knew it was meeting time
[03:06:01] <arschmitz> so i was checking what was going on if there was going to be one
[03:06:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, there was a netsplit right when I was about to kick it off, so now we're recovering.
[03:06:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Apparently, Changsuk has written something that was lost.
[03:06:57] <arschmitz> ok
[03:08:12] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Let's go on #jquery-meeting.
[03:08:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[03:09:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its still muted
[03:09:54] <arschmitz> freenode muted as sson as you unmuted 
[04:09:48] <Omar-> arschmitz gabriel_schulhof jasperdegroot toddmparker
[04:09:51] <Omar-> anyone?
[04:09:57] <arschmitz> Omar-: morning
[04:10:07] <Omar-> hi arschmitz, good morning
[04:10:55] <Omar-> arschmitz
[04:12:06] <Omar-> hmmm, bot? CAPTCHA test: 1+1/1*1=?
[04:12:19] <arschmitz> Omar-: ??
[04:12:44] <Omar-> i thought it was an auto reply
[04:12:58] <Omar-> anyway
[04:13:02] <Omar-> i need help in this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7563#issuecomment-48993284
[04:13:24] <Omar-> i'm new to git and al this stuff
[04:13:26] <Omar-> arschmitz
[04:13:36] <arschmitz> Omar-: ok what part do you need help with?
[04:14:03] <Omar-> pull request:
[04:14:20] <Omar-> i have forked jQM
[04:14:25] <Omar-> but how to add a branch?
[04:14:43] <arschmitz> once you have a fork you will need to make a local clone
[04:14:45] <Omar-> and what does "Add and run unit tests" mean?
[04:15:17] <arschmitz> we have a test suite that runs to make sure nothing gets broken when we make changes
[04:15:46] <Omar-> how do I do it?
[04:15:57] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I think this is only a demo, so the library is not modified.
[04:16:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I don't think we need unit tests in this case, right?
[04:16:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: tests still need to run we have demos tests
[04:16:13] <Omar-> yea, just a demo
[04:16:17] <Omar-> not that important
[04:16:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no need to add tests but they still need to be run
[04:16:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, right, those tests.
[04:16:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Of course.
[04:16:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, sorry!
[04:16:43] <gabriel_schulhof> ... the CI should catch whatever errors though.
[04:16:50] <Omar-> have you checked the demo? arschmitz gabriel_schulhof
[04:17:29] <Omar-> Do you think it is worth to be added? or is it trivial 
[04:18:16] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we should always have people run tests and not depend on ci
[04:18:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: espically when adding something new like a new demo vs an simple fix or update
[04:18:46] <arschmitz> Omar-: i looked quickly i just got back from vacation
[04:19:00] <arschmitz> a simple infinite scroll demo i think would be good if you have one though
[04:19:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You're right.
[04:19:41] <arschmitz> Omar-: i guess for me the real question is if this should be a simple plugin or just a code example
[04:20:06] <arschmitz> Omar-: for example we have demos of 3rd party widgets and plugins or we have some that are just a code example 
[04:20:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Would this extend page?
[04:20:13] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/r6T8S/show is a demo
[04:20:48] <arschmitz> Omar-: yes i more meant what it "should" be vs what it is right now it would just be a code example as it has no repo or anything
[04:21:00] <arschmitz> but im wondering if it should have its own repo and be a plugin
[04:21:12] <arschmitz> just a very simple one
[04:21:22] <Omar-> arschmitz: it's about how to utilize jQM built-in functions in a proper way. If they are used well, you dont need any plugin
[04:21:47] <Omar-> arschmitz: I dont think so, its so simple. just a little contribution to jQM
[04:22:02] <arschmitz> Omar-: not entirely true just because your using build in function does not mean it would not benefit from being wrapped into a nice small package
[04:22:56] <Omar-> arschmitz: Since I'm not a programmer/developer, I really dont know how to convert it into a plugin or a widget. my skills are limited to jQM/jQ only
[04:22:58] <arschmitz> Omar-: though to be clear im not expressing an opinion here on which it should be just saying its a question to be thought about with this demo
[04:23:29] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: A thought: Maybe a custom event? Like bottomreached?
[04:23:36] <Omar-> arschmitz: I understand you, dont worry.
[04:23:47] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof: yea, good idea.
[04:24:30] <gabriel_schulhof> The only thing that can be parameterized there is the contents of addMore.
[04:26:10] <gabriel_schulhof> I guess the added value is in the code that calculates whether addMore should be called or not.
[04:28:51] <arschmitz> Omar-: i need to run for a bit but ill be back in 45 minutes or so
[04:29:01] <Omar-> ok arschmitz, take care
[04:29:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: I can imagine this turned into a page extension with an API like so: $( "#my-list-page" ).on( "bottomreached", addMore );
[04:29:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: maybe but its not really about the page its about content
[04:29:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: for example most usescases will be all about listvieew
[04:30:01] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof: wow, nice idea. how to do it?
[04:30:53] <Omar-> arschmitz: could be used to navigate between pages too ;)
[04:31:11] <Omar-> hmmm..no, not a good idea i assume
[04:31:31] <arschmitz> Omar-: mixing scrolling and nav seems bad
[04:31:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ... if the page were to slide in from the bottom.
[04:31:52] <Omar-> arschmitz: yes true
[04:31:58] <gabriel_schulhof> But neah ... bad idea.
[04:32:06] <gabriel_schulhof> For content though ... :+1:
[04:33:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: So, you could do this: $.widget( "mobile.page", $.mobile.page, { _create: function() { this._super(); this._on( this.document, { scrollstop: "_handleScrollStop" }); }, ... });
[04:33:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: ... and then you write a function _handleScrollStop which does the calculation and then does a this._trigger( "bottomreached" );
[04:34:36] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof: that's all for a widget?
[04:35:15] <Omar-> I thought creating a widget is more complicated
[04:37:34] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof: another question, this custom event should be attached to document or pageContainer?
[04:39:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/35042b4445c3771827ed
[04:40:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: I haven't tested it, but that's how it has to look like.
[04:40:44] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: Put that in a file js/widgets/page.bottomreached.js and add it to js/index.php and js/jquery.mobile.js
[04:42:29] <Omar-> very nice!
[04:42:41] <Omar-> btw, the code here is cleaner http://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/infinite-scrolling/
[04:42:55] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/pAgbT/embedded/js/
[04:43:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: Look at it again. I've updated the gist to include the necessary jQM boilerplate.
[04:43:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: Remember, you need to account for both internal and external toolbars.
[04:43:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, you can have this: <div data-role="header">...</div><div data-role="page">...</div><div data-role="footer">...</div> as wel.
[04:44:29] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof: Oh true! I have totally forgot the external toolbars
[04:44:36] <gabriel_schulhof> It gets a bit more complicated, but I think it's worth the effort.
[04:45:49] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof: in this case, I need to look for toolbars in pageContainer too
[04:46:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[04:46:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Look at https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/35042b4445c3771827ed again.
[04:46:34] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof:  Thanks a lot for creating the file on github, it could have taken me ages to do it, lol
[04:46:54] <gabriel_schulhof> I've added a dependency on ../events/touch, because scrollstop is provided by that file.
[04:47:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: No problem. Happy to help. Do let me know if you need any more help.
[04:48:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: I have to go for a bit, but I always check in on IRC, and I can keep an eye on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7563 as well.
[04:48:33] <gabriel_schulhof> So, if you need help, either write it here or comment on that issue.
[04:48:34] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof: thanks a lot once again. I will play around with code
[04:48:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Awesome! Have fun!
[04:48:55] <Omar-> If I need something, I will holla at you :)
[04:49:11] <Omar-> take care gabriel_schulhof
[04:49:12] <Omar-> :)
[05:03:37] <arschmitz> Omar-: back
[05:03:43] <Omar-> wb arschmitz
[05:04:09] <Omar-> arschmitz: I'm working on defining external and internal toolbars
[05:04:26] <arschmitz> Omar-: ok one concern i had looking at your fiddle
[05:04:38] <arschmitz> is your checking dimensions on scroll which causes a forced layout 
[05:04:58] <arschmitz> forcedlayout in a tight loop like scroll is very bad for performance
[05:05:44] <Omar-> arschmitz: mind my ignorance, what's force layout?
[05:05:52] <Omar-> :)
[05:06:07] <arschmitz> its when you force the browser to update the layout to determin something 
[05:06:14] <arschmitz> like dimensions for example
[05:06:34] <arschmitz> when you query the dimensions of an object like a div or the body
[05:06:51] <arschmitz> you force the browser to update everything to determin the correct value
[05:07:26] <arschmitz> Omar-: this is a relatively expensive operation for the browser so doing it in a tight loop is generally to be avoided
[05:07:26] <Omar-> arschmitz: Is this a bad practice? becuase I run the code whenever scrollstop fires
[05:07:57] <arschmitz> well scroll stop is very different in yoru fiddle you use scroll i thought
[05:08:02] <arschmitz> but i see im wrong
[05:08:08] <arschmitz> scroll stop is fine
[05:08:11] <Omar-> arschmitz: I got you. Should it be delayed/supressed?
[05:08:37] <arschmitz> Omar-: no sorry your fine i thought you were listening to scroll not scroll stop
[05:09:04] <Omar-> arschmitz: Dont worry :) thanks for looking, and I appreciate your comments
[05:12:03] <Omar-> arschmitz: could you please have a look at line 34 http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/R7DDP/
[05:13:22] <arschmitz> Omar-: im a bit confused you are checking the same condition twice unless im missing something?
[05:14:05] <arschmitz> Omar-: i think you mean $(":mobile-pagecontainer > div.ui-header") || $(":mobile-pagecontainer > div.ui-footer")
[05:14:11] <arschmitz> same with line 40
[05:14:45] <Omar-> arschmitz I'm checking whether there's a footer or a header (externally).
[05:14:55] <Omar-> or internally
[05:15:06] <arschmitz> Omar-: right but your actually checking header twice rather then header and footer
[05:15:39] <Omar-> true, copy / paste error =D
[05:16:11] <Omar-> could it be simplified in a jQ style?
[05:18:46] <Omar-> arschmitz
[05:24:09] <arschmitz> Omar-: just a sec
[05:25:45] <Omar-> arschmitz tyt

[06:01:15] <arschmitz> Omar-: ^^
[06:01:24] <arschmitz> is the simplest way to do what you asked before i think
[06:02:22] <arschmitz> Omar-: that would add it to the actual library not just the demos
[06:02:38] <arschmitz> Omar-: for a demo you will just place it within the demo page
[06:04:44] <arschmitz> Omar-: you will want to use the -fixed classes not .ui-header / footer because that will find non fixed toolbars which you dont want

[06:08:21] <Omar-> arschmitz: I just saw your comments, I will update the JS file
[06:09:00] <Omar-> arschmitz: non-fixed do still occupy space, I may beed to test it thoroughly
[06:09:02] <Omar-> need*
[06:09:15] <arschmitz> Omar-: they do but its accounted for
[06:09:22] <arschmitz> because they are in the flow
[06:10:43] <Omar-> arschmitz: In your opinion finding .ui-header and then determining whether its fixed or not is bad practice?
[06:11:09] <arschmitz> Omar-: its just not needed
[06:11:26] <arschmitz> since fixed toolbars have a different class already so its easy to tell the difference
[06:11:54] <Omar-> arschmitz: sorry, I have to leave now. gotta pick up my son

[07:09:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What's up?
[07:09:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so i was looking at the pr from omar
[07:09:56] <arschmitz> and it got me thinking
[07:10:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: he did this as an extension to page thats part of the library
[07:11:00] <arschmitz> which is not the way to go i dont think for sure
[07:11:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but the event might be ok in the lib if it was a custom event like scrollstop
[07:11:49] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: infct it could be part of scrollstop kind like tap and taphold
[07:11:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The problem is, it pulls in toolbar at least.
[07:11:55] <arschmitz> or swipe and swipe right
[07:12:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: nah no need to account for any of that
[07:12:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: all you care about is that you are scrolled to the very bottom of the body
[07:13:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it could be usefull for a number of things
[07:14:09] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: to do infinite scroll, to do an ios7 style popup bottom bar
[07:14:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and other stuff im sure 
[07:14:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what do you think?
[07:17:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, OK by me.
[07:18:22] <gabriel_schulhof> If it's truly just a matter of triggering the new event together with scrollstop under special circumstances, then that's good.
[07:18:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i mean in theory its not like iv tried it lol
[07:18:51] <gabriel_schulhof> How long though before people will want a reachedtop?
[07:19:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Also, if we introduce a new event, we wanna make sure it's initialized when you bind to it.
[07:19:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well thats how custom events work
[07:20:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and its no different then swipe top bottom which we just say no to
[07:20:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, if you bind to scrollstop, the $.event.special setup/teardown for scrollstop get run, right? But if you also trigger reachedbottom or whatever we're gonna call it from the same spot that you trigger scrollstop, then you need to add an entry into $.event.special for reachedbottom - an entry that is an alias to scrollstop.
[07:21:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ah gotcha it could also just be its own event the depends on scrollstop
[07:21:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I mention this because I ran into a situation where I hooked into beforenavigate, but it wasn't firing, because nobody was listening to navigate.
[07:21:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: gotcha
[07:21:50] <scott_gonzalez> Aren't there plenty of standalone implementations for this already?
[07:21:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah. The solution is to attach a dummy event handler for scrollstop during setup and detach it during teardown.
[07:22:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: possibly have not looked yet someone just brought it up this morning
[07:22:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's how I've expressed the dependency.
[07:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/ for example
[07:23:22] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats much more generic but yeah iv used that before for other things
[07:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> That's my point. People should use the generic solutions.
[07:24:59] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah if any thing just make a demo of using this with jQuery mobile
[07:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> Custom implementations can even be as simple as 2 LOC: http://jsfiddle.net/doktormolle/w7X9N/
[07:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> Both of these (and plenty other results) are on the first page of Google for sane search terms.
[07:27:09] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: im sure as i said i had not search or done anything about this yet it was just a discussion based on a pr this morning
[07:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> All I know is I see a new version of this type of thing every few months.
[07:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> For the past few years.
[07:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> Implementing something specific to jQuery Mobile page widgets seems very unnecessary, unless there are specific reasons to do it.
[07:29:11] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah i had already said i didnt think anything like this should be part of the page widget which is what the pr was
[07:33:30] <gabriel_schulhof> I was a bit hasty, I guess. I just wanted to give Omar a container into which to pour the value-add of triggering such an event. However, if it really is so simple that we need not account for toolbars, then the special events section of the library is indeed a better place for this.
[07:33:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it honestly does not belong anywhere
[07:34:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: scott_gonzalez is right in that there are tons of implementations of this already
[07:34:32] <arschmitz> we dont need to make another one there is nothing special about jQuery mobile for this
[07:35:16] <gabriel_schulhof> There is, however, something to be said about avoiding DOM querying in a tight loop.
[07:35:29] <gabriel_schulhof> We could point out that using scrollstop is better than using scroll.
[07:35:37] <arschmitz> plus https://github.com/kpheasey/jqm.infinitescroll
[07:36:19] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the better way is actually to not use scrollstop though and to use scroll and just not query the dom in a loop and use a grid system
[07:36:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, that one uses scrollstop.
[07:37:10] <gabriel_schulhof> A grid system?
[07:37:42] <arschmitz> yes
[07:37:57] <arschmitz> you can know how much to add with out checking heights
[07:38:20] <arschmitz> if you use a grid system because then you know the height of your elements based on how many you have or add
[07:39:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: DaveMethvin has talked about this in one of his keynotes too http://www.slideshare.net/dmethvin/state-of-jquery-sept-2013
[07:39:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: go to slide 35
[07:41:07] <gabriel_schulhof> RIght, if your elements have fixed height, then scrollTop + number of elements is enough.
[07:41:21] <gabriel_schulhof> However, is checking scrollTop cheap?
[07:41:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Does it not trigger the same reflow that checking heights triggers?
[07:41:56] <arschmitz> scrolltop does not force layout
[07:42:04] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Then we're good.
[07:42:27] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but of course, it severely restricts your layout options - depending on what you wish to achieve.
[07:43:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: execpt infinite scroll pretty much always uses a grid
[07:43:12] <arschmitz> to load rows of something
[07:43:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ... that's true.
[07:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> Infinite scroll is usually a terrible UX choice.
[07:56:53] <scott_gonzalez> There are really only a few cases where it's good.
[07:58:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and regardless there are plenty of implementations of it even jqm specific ones
[08:49:04] <Omar-> arschmitz gabriel_schulhof
[08:49:08] <Omar-> I'm back
[08:49:51] <arschmitz> Omar-: after some discussion i really dont think we need to add anything like this and should really just recomend people use one of the many already existing solutions
[08:50:41] <arschmitz> Omar-: advising people use an untested un supported solution is not good ( demo ) and we dont want to add yet another implementation to the many out there when there is nothing specific to jquery mobile needed
[08:52:02] <arschmitz> http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/ for example gives the ability to react to scroll position
[08:52:40] <arschmitz> Omar-: and a scroll bottom event can be done in 2 lines http://jsfiddle.net/doktormolle/w7X9N/
[08:53:40] <arschmitz> Omar-: also there are already several jqm specific infitite scroll implementations out there like https://github.com/kpheasey/jqm.infinitescroll
[08:54:27] <arschmitz> Omar-: and if people don't want those there is your article explaining how to do it on your own :)
[08:56:00] <Omar-> arschmitz: Sure, no problems. There is no need to burden jQM with more stuff
[08:56:30] <arschmitz> Omar-: yeah we have to be pretty picky to avoide un needed bloat and also no need to duplicate effort with other projects
[08:58:34] <Omar-> arschmitz: I'll think of a different widget ;)
[08:58:52] <Omar-> something you woudln't reject..haha
[08:59:01] <Omar-> wouldn't*
[08:59:19] <arschmitz> Omar-: we have a road map for the foreseeable future though its always subject to change 
[09:00:42] <Omar-> arschmitz: deprecating page events was never foreseeable. It made many developer avoid jQM for their next projects
[09:01:04] <Omar-> at least pageshow and pagehide should have remained
[09:01:28] <arschmitz> Omar-: i disagree there is nothing you cant do with the pagecontainer equivilent just as easy
[09:01:30] <Omar-> but with the new update, it's easier to retrieve .toPage with some "if"
[09:01:38] <arschmitz> http://jquerymobile.com/roadmap/
[09:01:48] <arschmitz> Omar-: oh you mean pre 1.4.3
[09:02:15] <Omar-> yea
[09:02:20] <arschmitz> Omar-: i agree the topage and prevpage should have been there from the begining that was a mistake
[09:04:42] <Omar-> arschmitz: I'm writing an article about pagecontainer events
[09:04:50] <arschmitz> Omar-: cool
[09:04:59] <Omar-> started the preface and stopped
[09:05:00] <Omar-> haha
[09:05:27] <Omar-> i wrote a separate article about pagecontainerbeforechange
[09:06:12] <Omar-> i'm promoting jQM for free ;)
[09:06:19] <arschmitz> Omar-: cool the updated pagecontainer events i hope make things simpler and more consistent
[09:07:31] <Omar-> arschmitz: I too hope so. But as we have discussed before, a user will have to involve "if" or "switch/case"
[09:08:11] <arschmitz> yes or there is the toPage plugin
[09:08:13] <Omar-> to check page's ID
[09:08:17] <Omar-> or URL
[09:08:32] <Omar-> I haven't tried it
[09:08:49] <Omar-> in fact, I've tried once but didn't work
[09:08:55] <Omar-> 3 months back or so
[09:09:13] <arschmitz> Omar-: it depended on the updates to the library
[09:09:26] <arschmitz> because it checks the toPage properties
[09:09:44] <arschmitz> Omar-: so it only works with 1.4.3 +
[09:12:28] <Omar-> ohhh
[09:12:46] <Omar-> arschmitz: that's why it didn't work beofre, I used 1.4.2
[09:13:40] <Omar-> i'll check it now
[09:14:00] <Omar-> arschmitz: do you have a quick link/demo to it? ;)
[09:16:06] <arschmitz> yeah just a sec
[09:18:16] <Omar-> ok
[09:27:03] <arschmitz> Omar-: http://jsbin.com/ludibi/1/edit
[09:27:18] <arschmitz> it just logs to the console on beforehide in that example
[09:27:18] <Omar-> arschmitz: thanks :)
[09:27:51] <Omar-> I'll go through it's code to understand what happens under the hood
[09:28:07] <jperrault> which is less costly: .filter( selector ) or .attr( attribute )?
[09:28:20] <arschmitz> Omar-: it actually avoids all event binding 
[09:28:41] <arschmitz> which adds a bit of complexity
[09:29:30] <arschmitz> jperrault: i don't think there is a simple answer to that depends on the selectors and the collection its called on i think. 
[09:30:38] <Omar-> arschmitz: Do you have that library in your github?
[09:31:10] <arschmitz> Omar-: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile-onpage/
[09:32:53] <Omar-> arschmitz: thanks again. Btw, your debugger plugin doesn't work because of this line (132) " location: "docs.php", "
[09:33:03] <jperrault> I need to determine the active header inside of a nested statement in accordion's _refresh method, and I'm down to $( this ).filter( ".ui-accordion-content-active" ).length, or $( this ).attr( "aria-hidden" ).  I'm leaning towards .attr
[09:34:13] <arschmitz> Omar-: well do you have docs.php and are you using php?
[09:39:06] <Omar-> arschmitz: no, none
[09:39:21] <arschmitz> well those are both required
[09:39:25] <arschmitz> for it to work
[09:39:27] <Omar-> arschmitz: I'm not a developer and I've never created a jQM webapp
[09:39:52] <Omar-> arschmitz: so I cant test it on jsfiddle because of that line?
[09:40:00] <arschmitz> yes
[09:40:09] <arschmitz> well not because of that line
[09:40:14] <arschmitz> but because it requires php
[09:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Can you post the full block of code you're working with?
[09:40:35] <jperrault> sure, one sec
[09:40:43] <Omar-> scott_gonzalez: hola, que pasa
[09:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Are you fixing the issue where newly added panels are incorrectly opened on refresh?
[09:41:07] <Omar-> arschmitz: the onPage/offPage plugin is a gift
[09:41:21] <Omar-> arschmitz: a job very well done! 
[09:41:22] <jperrault> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9264
[09:41:29] <jperrault> one sec on the code snippet
[09:41:32] <arschmitz> Omar-: thank you
[09:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Why can't you just use `this.active` for that?
[09:42:22] <Omar-> arschmitz: my next article will be your plugin ;)
[09:42:42] <arschmitz> Omar-: cool i need to make better demos and documentation
[09:42:45] <arschmitz> its on my todo list
[09:43:21] <scott_gonzalez> Omar-: Not much, just doing ten things at once :-P
[09:43:25] <Omar-> arschmitz: I will test it thoroughly
[09:44:02] <Omar-> scott_gonzalez: good luck then ;)
[09:44:19] <Omar-> arschmitz: you never answered my email regarding fixed element with transition :P
[09:44:41] <arschmitz> Omar-: remind me 
[09:44:54] <Omar-> how did jQM managed to animate fixed toolbars without them losing their fixed property
[09:44:55] <arschmitz> what it was about
[09:46:39] <jperrault> current: http://tinyurl.com/kh7mtxb  proposed: http://tinyurl.com/nrycegd     this.active doesn't return a value inside .each
[09:47:22] <Omar-> arschmitz: when you apply "transition" to an elemenet with "position: fixed" they lose their position as well as this property
[09:47:51] <Omar-> sorry, when you apply "transition" to parent element.
[09:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Why not just `this.headers().show().each(...).height( maxHeight ).not( this.active ).hide()`?
[09:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> The headers shouldn't be hidden though.
[09:49:56] <Omar-> applying transition directly to fixed element directly doesn't affect its position/property
[09:50:27] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: sorry, disconnected for a moment there.
[09:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Why not just `this.headers().show().each(...).height( maxHeight ).not( this.active ).hide()`?
[09:50:49] <scott_gonzalez> But as I said above, the headers shouldn't be hidden.
[09:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> Just the content panels.
[09:54:09] <arschmitz> Omar-: im really not sure what you mean we dont do anything special we just apply our normal transition classes
[09:56:42] <arschmitz> we dont unfix them until after when they are set to position absolute
[09:57:14] <arschmitz> or completely hidden for footers ( external ) or block ( internal )
[09:57:19] <arschmitz> Omar-: ^^
[09:58:09] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Palestinian closed pull request #7566: Feature request - "bottomreached" event (06master...06master) 02http://git.io/5_VyWw
[10:00:18] <Omar-> arschmitz: brb
[10:00:50] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: currently, the content panel height isn't computing correctly when heightStyle='auto', *whether the panel is active or not*.  The only effective means I've found to force it is to do a .show, which means I need to retain the panel's active status before performing the .show.
[10:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: But why not something like: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/8a6b54238974e20e2e75
[10:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need to know whether it's active inside the loop.
[10:12:15] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: yep.  that works.
[10:12:51] <Omar-> arschmitz: i'm back
[10:17:19] <Omar-> arschmitz: to understand what I mean, pls check this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/C3Tz4/
[10:17:37] <Omar-> scroll up and down before you click "Menu"
[10:18:11] <Omar-> the fixed header is no longer fixed, because I'm applying "transition" on page itself
[10:18:29] <Omar-> not on .ui-content nor .ui-header separately
[10:18:47] <Omar-> this is a none bug for elements with `position: fixed`
[10:19:29] <Omar-> I thought jQM had a solution, actually, you do have dodged it.
[10:24:35] <arschmitz> ok i gotcha
[10:25:59] <Omar-> arschmitz: jQM applies transition class to panel-wrapper that wraps contents and it adds same classes directly to header/footer divs
[10:26:40] <Omar-> if transition classes were added to page, both header/footer will lose their fixed position, I assume
[10:26:41] <arschmitz> Omar-: yup specificly to avoid some bugs like that
[10:26:43] <Omar-> .
[10:29:12] <Omar-> arschmitz: yea, there's no fix for this so far
[10:37:30] <Omar-> arschmitz: do you think is is a valid way of passing params? http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/RFv4C/
[10:37:45] <Omar-> start from line 24
[10:39:05] <arschmitz> Omar-: well there is no gurantee that would continue to work in the future

[10:39:53] <arschmitz> Omar-: and what are you trying to pass the data to?
[10:40:20] <arschmitz> oh never mind had to scroll
[10:47:38] <Omar-> arschmitz: using ` ui.options ` to pass data
[10:48:40] <Omar-> but the problem is you'll need to use changePage
[10:49:08] <Omar-> changePage is sometimes buggy especially if `data-rel=back` is used
