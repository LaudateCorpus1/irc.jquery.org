[09:23:57] <gnarf> talk about a shitty morning
[09:24:02] <gnarf> waking up late, with a migrane
[09:27:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so that fix for 7357 looked good to you?
[09:27:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> thanks

[10:06:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i asked jstroem (lindstroem @git) to stop in to the meeting wednesday if he can
[10:06:30] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:06:33] <gnarf> I wanna talk about pulling split in and replacing .explode with it
[10:07:07] <gnarf> so if you got some time to review that long ass pull request before wednesday, it'd be nice to know if you have any objections to that :)
[10:07:59] <gnarf> I'm having him look into our current explode effect and see if there are any options / etc that he doesn't have in his version
[10:08:23] <gnarf> and also verify that his new one does the same thing as our old one
[10:20:19] <gnarf> also, so long as you're around - I'm still stalled on effects docs
[10:20:54] <gnarf> looking at the way these things operate, i think the indvidual effects are gonna need something like a selecor has but with options like a widget
[10:21:08] <gnarf> because usage is .hide/show/toggle
[10:22:04] <gnarf> also - ran into a potential docs issue I'm not sure you guys have solved yet.... What do we do about the core functions that UI decorates (particularly effects) --- toggleClass addClass removeClass now taking duration,etc as well as hide/show/toggle gaining the "effects"
[10:49:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer danheberden? ^^^ ?
[10:51:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I know nothing about docs
[10:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> but I assume that the ability to define a method many times already exists
[10:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> I know at a minimum this has been thought of
[10:52:06] <scott_gonzalez> (the fact that we add new signatures for core methods)
[10:52:58] <scott_gonzalez> as for split, I don't think I'll be reviewing that pull request this week
[10:53:32] <jzaefferer> am I missing one? http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40076546/Grid-CustomInputs
[10:56:59] <danheberden> gnarf - richard should be around for any docs stuff, he's got a few master plans in his head about it i know
[10:57:46] <gnarf> kk
[10:58:04] <gnarf> is richard gonna be available for the meeting this week? dunno if he's still out of town or what
[10:58:48] <jzaefferer> he's probably unavailable the entire week
[10:58:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no prob if you don't have the time, expect a report from me & lindstroem on wednesday... I might see if he's up for doing the text effects too
[10:59:26] <jzaefferer> we should do a seperate meeting about docs early next week
[10:59:29] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[10:59:50] <jzaefferer> get Scott and me and anyone else up to speed on what's going on, and write some docs for new components to test things out
[11:00:10] <jzaefferer> we've got that on our plate for way too long now
[11:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: missing select
[11:02:09] <jzaefferer> that would be http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu right?
[11:02:22] <gnarf> jzaefferer: agreed - also its like 100% easier when working on docs to have two eyes on a page
[11:02:34] <gnarf> or well
[11:02:35] <gnarf> four
[11:02:36] <gnarf> i guess
[11:02:43] <gnarf> maybe eight if you both have glasses
[11:03:25] <gnarf> lemme know about this docs meet
[11:03:56] <gnarf> I'm gonna work on just writing out some content about everything, not necessarily putting it into XML yet
[11:04:35] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez, what's your availability next week? perferably Monday/Tuesday
[11:04:42] <jzaefferer> same for danheberden
[11:04:47] <jzaefferer> gnarf is around anyway :-)
[11:05:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: should be pretty open on Monday and Tuesday
[11:06:05] <gnarf> anytime after jquery meetings i seem to be awake pretty consistently :)
[11:06:44] <jzaefferer> okay, so after jQuery core meeting?
[11:07:14] <jzaefferer> that day I'll actually be on client site, so "late" works for me
[11:08:28] <jzaefferer> added an entry to the jQuery Meetings calendar
[11:13:22] <gnarf> k - bbiab gotta run over to my new apartment and let the maintenance guy in
[11:13:27] <gnarf> so he can fix my tub
[11:13:35] <gnarf> clawfoot tub FTW!!! :)
[11:20:06] <jzaefferer> can I tweet this via @jqueryui? "We'll be working on new (and old) custom inputs for Grid stage 3: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40076546/Grid-CustomInputs Your help is welcome! Freenode / #jqueryui-dev"

[11:42:57] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master Scott González * a88d55e (2 files in 1 dirs): Tabs: Enable test suites for TestSwarm.
[11:42:57] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master commits 965cb73...a88d55e - http://bit.ly/jGc653
[11:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> MORE TESTS
[11:46:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery-ui/a88d55e/tests/unit/tabs/tabs.html :-)
[12:39:57] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, what was the main concern against supporting event delegation in the widget factory (via _bind, or extra _delegate)? nested widgets?
[12:40:26] <jzaefferer> if thats the only reason, are there some actual usecases that I could test?
[12:43:13] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, just nested widgets, which we can handle pretty easily
[12:53:27] <jzaefferer> so then the question would mostly be about syntax
[12:54:09] <jzaefferer> Backbone.js has an event property on views: events: { "click .selector": "method" }
[12:54:39] <jzaefferer> not a fan of those magic strings in general, but it makes for pretty succinct syntax
[12:55:05] <jzaefferer> e.g. ._bind({ "click button": "method" } in widget factory context
[12:55:30] <jzaefferer> very straightforward to parse
[12:56:22] <jzaefferer> and working on Mobile SoundCloud with Backbone.js for a few months now, I can't remember any issue, e.g. bug, due to that stuff
[13:00:43] <jzaefferer> hey gnarf, what's up with that? http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=17518&client_id=6815
[13:00:53] <jzaefferer> also ping scott_gonzalez
[14:01:20] <gnarf> jzaefferer: hrm
[14:02:02] <gnarf> is that on master?
[14:03:38] <gnarf> jzaefferer: it passes on my mac
[14:03:40] <gnarf> against master
[14:04:57] <gnarf> jzaefferer: it might be related to the timeout value
[14:04:59] <gnarf> ???
[14:05:08] <gnarf> but i would think the other two would fail
[14:05:12] <gnarf> as well
[14:09:28] <gnarf> jzaefferer: it passes when I run that in my win7 chrome vm on my local copy
[14:18:31] <jzaefferer> yeah, TestSwarm tends to produce false negatives :/
[14:19:36] <jzaefferer> or its a bad client, here it could be someone running a dev build of chrome
[14:20:18] <jzaefferer> yeah, Chrome 12
[14:20:21] <jzaefferer> stable should be 11
[14:24:53] <gnarf> jzaefferer: that approach for that test might be bad too... not sure how requestAnimateFrame() will work with it / what not
[14:25:15] <gnarf> it starts a 100ms animation and pauses at 50ms to test the values
[14:25:44] <gnarf> I'm probably going to continue to use that approach, unless you can think of something more clever... I'll likely make it a var at the top of the file tho in case we need to change it
[15:21:59] <gnarf> jzaefferer / scott_gonzalez - can one of you cherry pick https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/commit/f1763d7874894e250e83b7ecef8888e93d88fde9 into master?
[15:22:09] <gnarf> just some cleanup
[15:22:26] <gnarf> and i made the durations 200/100 to maybe make the swarm more likely to catch? shrug
[18:06:35] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: newest files are on CDN
[18:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> awesome, thanks
