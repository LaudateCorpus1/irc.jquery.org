[13:21:10] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Datepicker i18n: Changed Hebrew monthNamesShort from number to names. Fixes #6051 - Hebrew and Arabic: Instead of the month name indicates the month number! - levushka
[13:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7993
[13:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> We use h5bp's .visuallyhidden for .ui-helper-hidden-accessible
[13:47:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's an old version, but even updating to what's in h5bp master doesn't fix it.
[13:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> Any thoughts?
