[06:39:15] <petersendidit> What is the target date for releasing 1.10.1 now that jQuery 1.9.1 is out?
[06:43:59] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully this week, if not, definitely next week.
[06:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on the swarm failures right now.
[06:50:17] <petersendidit> whats the best way to view the swarm failures?
[06:51:13] <DaveMethvin> petersendidit: i always view them with a skeptical eye
[06:52:28] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i wonder if firefox changed focus handling recently?
[06:52:40] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You mean the swarm failures?
[06:52:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:52:43] <scott_gonzalez> It's a BrowserStack bug.
[06:52:55] <DaveMethvin> oh it's not keeping the browser in focus?
[06:53:02] <scott_gonzalez> Must not be.
[06:53:03] <DaveMethvin> i noticed they sometimes go away if i rerun
[06:53:14] <DaveMethvin> i got one glorious clean run before 1.9.1
[06:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> I can't get it fail if I use the BrowserStack UI.
[06:53:27] <scott_gonzalez> We haven't had a successful UI run in 2 months :-(
[06:53:48] <DaveMethvin> i feel like ripping every focus-related test out, they are so unreliable
[06:55:12] <scott_gonzalez> I find the only focus failures come from an unfocused browser or poorly written tests.
[06:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> Of course it took me a few years to start feeling that way.
[06:56:14] <DaveMethvin> i dunno, we've gotten a couple of IE9 focus ones that are really annoying lately like the one i just commented on
[06:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, am I doing this right? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/df179542cc6593b1816d487c72c470a73940ff11
[06:56:40] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Scott Gonz√°lez (3d 17h 4m 36s): Datepicker: Escape single quotes in tooltips. Fixes #9049 - Datepicker beforeShowDay tooltip not displayed properly if single quote is used.
[06:57:30] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, iframes just suck in general.
[06:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> That test is failing in IE.
[06:58:56] <DaveMethvin> is it showing the html escape?
[06:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:59:24] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[06:59:37] <DaveMethvin> i could go either way on that one
[06:59:51] <DaveMethvin> seems like IE may have a point
[07:00:09] <DaveMethvin> otherwise it wouldn't round-trip for example
[07:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> What's the proper way to escape a quote?
[07:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> I tried using a slash, but it didn't seem to actually work.
[07:00:36] <DaveMethvin> since the title is an attribute, i do think it's an html entity
[07:00:48] <DaveMethvin> oh but you probably want the code and not the symbol
[07:00:55] <DaveMethvin> xhtml will choke on it i think
[07:00:57] <scott_gonzalez> Right, which is why I thought it was supposed to be \'
[07:01:10] <DaveMethvin> not an an attribute
[07:01:34] <DaveMethvin> oh my computer is here
[07:04:50] <scott_gonzalez> StackOverflow seems to agree that it should be an HTML entity.

[07:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Interestingly, IE was bombing on &apos; but properly handling &#39;
[07:29:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: when ever you have some free time toddmparker wanted me to catch up with you
[07:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: How much time do you need?
[07:31:31] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: not really sure he wanted me to start talking to you about bringing mobile inline with ui and the core changes and stuff
[07:31:53] <arschmitz> he wants me to kinda take charge of that from our side and work with you he said
[07:32:17] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, ok.
[07:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like we've had that conversation several times :-P
[07:32:37] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like there's 1 legit fail in dialog and 1 in selectable, everything else is bogus.
[07:33:32] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I can talk now.
[07:33:37] <arschmitz> ok
[07:34:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: what do you think is the best place for us to start?
[07:35:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i know some of our widgets need a lot fo work right now
[07:35:55] <scott_gonzalez> First thing should be updating Mobile to use UI core.
[07:36:03] <arschmitz> ok
[07:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> Which means getting rid of stuff like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L91
[07:36:28] <scott_gonzalez> Which was clearly taken from UI in the first place :-P
[07:36:32] <arschmitz> yeah you already have that in ui core 
[07:36:38] <arschmitz> yup
[07:37:03] <scott_gonzalez> I can tell because it has comments on all the key codes that don't belong there :-)
[07:37:20] <arschmitz> lol
[07:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> I was a little over-ambitious when I wrote that list the first time...
[07:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'll go through the UI code and see if we can get rid of all the uses of .zIndex() now so that we can deprecate it in 1.11 and remove in 1.12.
[07:39:32] <arschmitz> ok
[07:39:58] <arschmitz> ill look at ui core and mobile core and see if there is anything else thats a dup
[07:40:02] <scott_gonzalez> You should go through the Mobile widgets and look for places where you can use .uniqueId().
[07:40:13] <arschmitz> ok
[07:42:47] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: This looks wrong: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L249
[07:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> $.extend( $.mobile, { ... }, $.mobile );
[07:43:18] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, you have:
[07:43:18] <scott_gonzalez> $.extend( $.mobile, { ... }, $.mobile );
[07:43:21] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[07:43:28] <arschmitz> yeah that isnt right
[07:43:29] <scott_gonzalez> you have
[07:43:30] <scott_gonzalez> $.mobile = $.extend( $.mobile, { ... }, $.mobile );
[07:43:33] <scott_gonzalez> Which can just be:
[07:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> $.extend( $.mobile, { ... } );
[07:44:03] <arschmitz> yup
[07:44:12] <jquicommit> [13download.jqueryui.com] 15tjvantoll opened issue #98: Download Builder: Preserve CSS file ordering  02http://git.io/oQyk3g
[07:44:26] <arschmitz> a lot of this isa bit old and crufty ill be the first to admit
[07:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have a lot of these types of methods? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L315-L322
[07:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> Or is it limited to what's in this file?
[07:48:18] <arschmitz> i think its limited to whats in this file
[07:48:31] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L299 shouldn't wrap `this`. It just gets wrapped in the next call anyway.
[07:48:31] <arschmitz> it should be anyway!
[07:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> In fact, it shouldn't wrap it anyway, since it's already a jQuery object.
[07:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> This code is so non-idiomatic jQuery.
[07:49:42] <arschmitz> i know :(
[07:49:51] <arschmitz> it all predates my involvment
[07:50:30] <arschmitz> its my job now to try and fix it and make it work with ui :)
[07:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> Another spot where wrapping is wasteful: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L312
[07:51:49] <scott_gonzalez> And you can drop the / in the <div/>
[07:52:00] <scott_gonzalez> And you should use <a> instead of <div> to save bytes.
[07:52:27] <arschmitz> ok
[07:54:14] <scott_gonzalez> This seems to be a common pattern: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L303
[07:55:38] <arschmitz> ugh the dependants stuff thats to support a feature we never should have had lol
[07:55:40] <scott_gonzalez> Why merge intead of .add()? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L305
[07:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> I should stop going through all the lines here :-P
[07:56:09] <arschmitz> i honestly dont know why they are doing it that way
[07:56:15] <arschmitz> it seems like it hsould be add
[07:56:38] <scott_gonzalez> What is this check doing? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L274
[07:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to handle an empty string?
[07:57:11] <scott_gonzalez> Seems strange.
[07:58:11] <arschmitz> yeah seems odd
[07:59:21] <arschmitz> if im not mistaken it returns undefined with or with out the check if its = undefined
[07:59:49] <arschmitz> why would we set and undefined string to undefined
[08:00:34] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: anyway yeah i agree it does not make sense
[08:04:04] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: at any rate it is not needed because nsNormalize already does that check and returns the prop if false
[08:04:10] <arschmitz> so its completely redundant
[08:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, lots of redundancy in this file :-P
[08:04:40] <arschmitz> yup
[08:05:42] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so the plan here is to incorperate the ui core as is in the same way we do the widget factory now right?
[08:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> UI core will shrink over time.
[08:06:19] <arschmitz> ok just wanted to make sure we were on the same page lol
[08:06:50] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah and its not very big right now really
[08:08:44] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and looking real wuick a huge chunk is for depreciated stuff or stuff thats for old versions of jquery so time will slim it down pretty quickly it seems
[08:09:44] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:12:22] <arschmitz> well looks like i have plenty to start with just picking through our core for stuff lol

[08:49:00] <b-ot> rxaviers: Issue #96 by jzaefferer (19h 7m 18s): Log: CSS and Image requests for ThemeRoller
[09:52:01] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers: Either of you around
[09:52:37] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: sort of ‚Ä¶ in meetings in Miami and about to have lunch i think. what's up?
[09:52:45] <scott_gonzalez> Does this seem sane? https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/c68824d2dbed785323ca
[09:53:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to kill .zIndex().
[09:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like we'll want to use .ui-front for submenus, but not the top menu, so even once menu is updated, we'd still need to add ui-front inside autocomplete.
[09:54:28] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, actually, I guess submenus don't need ui-front because they're descendants of the main menu, right?
[09:54:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i think so ‚Ä¶ i haven't actually taken the time to see exactly what ui-front does but if it does what i think it does, then yes i think that makes sense :)
[09:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> In terms of CSS, .ui-front is just z-index: 100.
[09:55:13] <kborchers> is it adjusted if something else is over 100?
[09:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> Nope.
[09:55:33] <scott_gonzalez> The idea is that .ui-front is used as a concept everywhere in UI.
[09:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> It gets used in conjunction with an appendTo option.
[09:55:47] <kborchers> ok, so if someone sets 101 on something else then it's behind but they probably want that
[09:55:52] <scott_gonzalez> And appendTo defaults to walking up the DOM looking for other .ui-front elements.
[09:56:04] <scott_gonzalez> And if it finds one, it appends to that element, instead of the body.
[09:56:15] <kborchers> ah, ok that's cool
[09:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> In theory this should solve our z-index problems.
[09:56:40] <kborchers> yeah
[09:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> Because the widgets now expose when they create "layers"
[09:57:53] <kborchers> yeah i think this is sane then ‚Ä¶ but yes, it would have to be added to the base for autocomplete (menubar, selectmenu) i think
