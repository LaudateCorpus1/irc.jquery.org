[04:42:03] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, guys I need your input. When you have some spare time, please take a look at https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/pull/57#issuecomment-10900618
[04:42:23] <rxaviers> (it's a high level definition)
[04:55:32] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: your suggestion sounds good to me
[04:55:42] <rxaviers> okie dokie
[04:55:45] <rxaviers> thks
[04:55:57] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I also wouldn't worry about it too much. Get it done, fix it if someone complains :-)
[04:56:49] <rxaviers> sure! But, good to align with you guys first.
[04:56:52] <rxaviers> :)
[05:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Your suggestion sounds good to me.
[05:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub sure is harder to use without icons :-/
[05:14:08] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, great ok thks
[05:14:11] <rxaviers> still without icons! ouch
[05:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's been a few days now, it really sucks.
[05:14:46] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, have you purged out your cache? you are on mac right?
[05:15:26] <rxaviers> can you downgrade it OR download and test a user installed chrome there?
[05:16:47] <rxaviers> (with user installed I mean without using the mac pkg manager `port` if it's the case)
[05:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting 200 for the fonts, so it's not a cache issue.
[05:17:47] <scott_gonzalez> I have cache disabled when the dev tools are open.
[05:19:04] <rxaviers> it works there on firefox, right. So, it's a chrome thing
[05:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, sweet sweet success.
[05:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=120929
[05:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> This was the fix for me: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=120929#c13
[05:22:11] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, there are a lot more fonts on Google Web Fonts than the last time I looked.
[05:22:51] <rxaviers> holy c..
[05:22:55] <rxaviers> that's cool

[05:38:35] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez / mikesherov / anybody else who might find this useful - I made a minimal jsFiddle for each widget / interaction based off of master - http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/Qp39S/show/. 
[05:39:02] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: nice
[05:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> We should definitley point users to that instead of the blank fiddle.
[05:39:57] <mikesherov> tj_vantoll: scott_gonzalez: we should document this in our wiki
[05:40:34] <mikesherov> Which leads to a different discussion: moving away from pbwiki, possibly to GH pages?
[05:40:50] <tj_vantoll> Sounds good.  I'll change up the wording later to make it more friendly / useable for invalid tickets.
[05:41:07] <mikesherov> Thanks tj_vantoll really useful
[05:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Yup, the only thing holding that up is email notifications.
[05:42:24] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: You want emails on wiki changes?
[05:42:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:42:58] <mikesherov> So if GH wiki supported that, we'd move to that?
[05:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> I think gnarf was looking into building it.
[05:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> Since the wiki is just another repo underneath.
[05:45:19] <scott_gonzalez> The diffs probably won't be as nice as pbwiki, but we at least need something.
[05:54:13] <mikesherov> So it needs to email a diff... Ok. Is that something to get done for 1.10?
[05:55:37] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I don't see a lot of meta Dev tickets. We should be tracking this stuff so I can know your Reqs and slowly but surely get it done. 
[05:56:04] <mikesherov> Unless you'd rather keep it casual of course.

[06:35:30] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, if the user wanted to add the resize image back to the dialog.. would that be too difficult?
[06:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, just a few rules in their stylesheet.
[06:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> .ui-dialog .ui-resizable-se { width: 14px; height: 14px; right: 3px; bottom: 3px; }
[06:36:47] <scott_gonzalez> That will give you the old style back.
[06:37:03] <scott_gonzalez> The icon is still there, I just shifted/resized the handle enough that you can't see it.
[06:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: If people feel strongly about it, I'm willing to revert, since it's just as easy for users to modify the CSS in either direction.
[06:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's bad for the resize handle to cover the scrollbar.
[06:39:12] <_zoggy_> yeah, i personally like the resize image. i've never seen it cover a scrollbar.. as its in the button pane not in the content section
[06:39:23] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we can add some bottom padding to the dialog if it's resizable and there are no buttons.
[06:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> Well, this only occurs if you don't have buttons.
[06:39:41] <_zoggy_> gotcha
[06:39:51] <_zoggy_> ive never had a dialog with no buttons
[06:40:22] <_zoggy_> or a dialog without a titlebar
[06:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, a dialog without a titlebar isn't a dialog :-P
[06:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> It's basically just a draggable at that point.
[06:44:23] <_zoggy_> i have a dialog that opens, http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=p01G8Ekc
[06:44:46] <_zoggy_> is there a more efficent way of doing the height/width/etc than what im doing
[06:46:24] <scott_gonzalez> Do you ever have documents that are narrower than the window?
[06:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> I would think $(window).height() would be what you want in all cases.
[06:50:31] <_zoggy_> dunno exactly how to answer the document vs window question, the ui is 100% width of browser.. and when we trigger the dialog i want everything to focus on that as its prompting for data to move onto the next step

[07:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: Yeah, you probably don't need to do the document or window checks, just simplify to using window.
[07:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's see what fails with the style check re-enabled.

[07:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8880
[07:06:13] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like alert() inside anything voids your warranty.
[07:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> It kills focus and changes a fair amount of behavior.
[07:07:05] <_zoggy_> yeah, tell that person to 'capture' his alert to the console and see what happens then
[07:27:35] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: sure, we can close alert issues as wontfix

[07:40:18] <mikesherov> We'll figure it out
[07:40:25] <Dave_Stein> yup
[07:40:55] <Dave_Stein> strangely enoguh I still have to get git on a laptop to bring haha I still never bought a laptop of my own and just use some work ones, which drives my coworkers nuts
[07:42:26] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, actually i know why i did that code now.. the content we show is dynamic.. and the data we show at first (list of users directories is usually not too long) but when they start drilling down it gets long. so we try to show a decent dialog size and reduce the need to resize for the majority of users.. then the window check is for those that are using crap resolutions/tablet/ios 
[07:42:26] <_zoggy_> whatever where our 'decent' size would be too big for them
[07:54:11] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: Well, that makes sense for Math.min($(document).width() - 80, 650),
[07:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> But this seems unnecessary: Math.min($(document).height() - 80, $(window).height() - 80),
[07:54:48] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose that's for really short documents?
[08:13:27] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what do you think of changing s/bind/on/g on all app/resources/*js? We're always using the latest jQuery version and `on` is preferred since 1.7.
[08:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's a good change.
[08:13:58] <rxaviers> cool, will do. thks

[09:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> We had the QuickNav first, this whole thing came up because of the issue to move it below the description.

[09:11:36] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer I wanna make this function https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/app/resources/hash.js#L47 more clear. So, we can use it: `Hash.update( newHash, { ignore: true } /* more descriptive */ )`, instead of `Hash.update( newHash, true /* what's true about?? */ )`
[09:12:02] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: go for it
[09:12:04] <rxaviers> any suggestion for the `ignore` options name? a) preventChange, b) "dontTriggerChangeEvent"!!?
[09:12:15] <rxaviers> kidding about (b). but, that's the point
[09:12:51] <rxaviers> any cool name?
[09:13:11] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: yes, I agree. The quick nav makes sense to always be first. The Description used to be last. And then there was a decision to move the description to the top because it was being lost. I think moving the description towards the top is a good idea, but I think it should remain after the quick nav
[09:13:34] <rxaviers> ignore or preventChange is not good because it sounds like the Hash isnt going to be updated accordingly.
[09:14:37] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Just get everyone else on board, I'll implement whatever the involved parties want.
[09:14:58] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg rworth ajpiano rxaviers: ^
[09:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'm not concerned about the clarity of that function, we use silencing flags in a few places in UI.
[09:21:44] <rxaviers> My opinion is: 1st description, 2nd quick nav. Why?  Quick nav is only useful if the user has a notion of what the page is about. The description is the briefest way of telling someone what the whole stuff is about, so he can go further and navigate to the point he wants.
[09:23:00] <ajpiano> i tend to agree with rxaviers that a small description makes sense before the quicknav
[09:23:14] <jzaefferer> Short desc, quicknav, long desc, everything else?
[09:23:26] <jzaefferer> We have those separate description elements anyway
[09:24:00] <jzaefferer> API docs are the pages that people come back to again and again, so repeat visitors are as important, or even more important, then first-time visitors
[09:24:33] <rxaviers> short desc, quicknav, long desc +1
[09:25:16] <jzaefferer> agcolom: ^
[09:26:53] <agcolom> rxaviers: jzaefferer ajpiano ok but sometimes a short desc is actually quite a long one...
[09:27:05] <jzaefferer> agcolom: then shorten it :p
[09:27:18] <jzaefferer> agcolom: do you have an example where that is a problem?
[09:27:26] <agcolom> yes
[09:27:36] <agcolom> let me find it...
[09:29:15] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/136
[09:30:03] <agcolom> so see http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/textinput/, the quick nav gets lost 
[09:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> That's not the shortdesc, that's the longdesc.
[09:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> The shortdesc is 1 line of text.
[09:30:44] <agcolom> so only the short desc comes first?
[09:31:12] <agcolom> currently all the desc comes first... i thougth...
[09:31:17] <scott_gonzalez> The proposal is short desc, QuickNav, long desc, options, methods, events, examples
[09:31:32] <agcolom> ok, that's fine then
[09:31:46] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll make that change today.
[09:31:51] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna go try my luck at the DMV.
[09:32:06] <agcolom> Thanks!
[09:32:36] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: is that the car thing to change your number plate?
[10:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Yes, though I can't go because we can't find the keys to our lockbox which has our passports in it :-/
[10:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> I hate moving so much.
[10:35:10] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, coding standards question: https://gist.github.com/4207213
[10:47:17] <rxaviers> another question: is inline functions like this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/draggable/draggable_events.js#L16 ok?
[10:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin mikesherov: ^
[10:52:43] <scott_gonzalez> The inline function is not ok.
[10:53:08] <mikesherov> not ok
[10:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> I tend to do either a or c, for the nested functions, but I don't know which is technically correct.
[10:53:15] <mikesherov> curlys always have lines
[10:53:40] <mikesherov> I prefer d myself
[10:53:52] <mikesherov> I don't think any are more correct though
[10:54:09] <scott_gonzalez> We should pick one and document it :-)
[10:54:11] <mikesherov> a is the most correcgt
[10:54:23] <mikesherov> but really, rwaldron knows better
[10:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, headed to the DMV for real this time (Krisin found the keys to the lockbox).
[10:54:31] <mikesherov> he's the keeper
[10:54:33] <scott_gonzalez> Too bad that punk doesn't hang out in here.
[10:56:26] <mikesherov> hey, github flavored markdown question
[10:56:45] <mikesherov> nvm
[11:15:04] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, mikesherov, thanks for looking into this. That's tricking me. Because, if (a) is correct, it is an exception to use glued parens ")))". The coding standards tells nothing about it. Actually, all examples show spaced parens...
[11:15:37] <mikesherov> I don't really know
[11:15:47] <rxaviers> In jQuery source though, I found a lot of '))' occurrences.
[11:17:20] <rxaviers> When we start having exceptions, the trouble begins.
[11:45:46] <_zoggy_> In Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 8, you can use the aria-haspopup DOM property to simulate mouse hover functionality in touch-based scenarios. You can read more about this behavior in Using aria-haspopup to simulate hover on touch-enabled devices.
[11:45:47] <_zoggy_> This use for aria-haspopup is not supported in Windows 7. Adding "aria-haspopup="true"" to an element doesn't simulate mouse hover in Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 7. However, the aria-haspopup property is still supported for reporting accessibility information to assistive technologies.
[11:45:58] <_zoggy_> we do anything with that for our recent changes on dialog
[12:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> No, there's no element for us to put that on.
[12:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Need some help with CSS.
[12:46:20] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: need some time
[12:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> orig = element.css( "height" )
[12:46:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting 0px instead of auto, since it's hidden.
[12:46:54] <scott_gonzalez> Even if it wasn't hidden, I'd be getting a computed value.
[13:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/textinput/
[14:07:47] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: THANK YOU!!!!!!! 
[14:08:26] <agcolom> it's perfect!!!!! I am so happy ;-)
