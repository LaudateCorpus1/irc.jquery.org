[05:23:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well 304 just means not modified serve from cache
[05:24:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and by his last comment it sounds like its fixed on master?

[05:25:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and ideapad yoga which is windows PRO touchscreen will be here next week
[05:27:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, would be cool if you can do some nav testing when you have those devices.
[05:27:12] <arschmitz> will do
[05:27:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also not sure if this is a dist vs master issue

[05:27:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, neither am I
[05:28:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we should test with alpha 2

[06:11:40] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jquery core has decoupled its source files into very micro/specific things like ./var/arr.js (the `AMD` branch to be landed soon), and they are also using a structure similar to what Alex Sexton suggested here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1029#discussion_r5258377 .
[06:11:40] <b-ot> rxaviers: Pull request #1029 by rxaviers (4w 1d ago): AMD support
[06:12:07] <rxaviers> How are we likely to do a similar thing on UI
[06:12:47] <rxaviers> and on mobile? (uGoMobi ^)
[06:12:53] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: UI Core and Effects Core are the only things that will get broken up.
[06:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> Mobile is already split like crazy.
[06:13:18] <arschmitz> rxaviers: mobile is already pretty specific
[06:16:41] <rxaviers> lol, it is.. I guess for mobile my question limits to naming structure (without the jquery.mobile...)
[06:17:05] <arschmitz> rxaviers: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5982
[06:17:05] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #5982 by uGoMobi (3mon 6d ago): Update file structure to match ui and address file order in builds
[06:17:40] <arschmitz> rxaviers: we will be changing our structure to match ui after we finish 1.4
[06:17:54] <arschmitz> same with our file naming conventions
[06:20:11] <rxaviers> ok, so mobile is in sync with UI, so that delegates mobile question to you scott :P
[06:20:34] <rxaviers> I vaguely know the UI source names have changed in the past (from simpler names into the full names we have now)
[06:21:06] <rxaviers> is there any history behind that choice?
[06:21:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think i found an issue with flipswitch when fixing a bug but its also a bug so can be fixed after if its holding anything up
[06:23:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe you can fix it in a branch
[06:23:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: either way its just a bug so if im not done when we release ill just commit after
[06:24:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, same idea
[06:32:56] <gseguin> yo
[06:33:35] <gseguin> what's happening?
[06:35:35] <gseguin> arschmitz: you still have things to commit?
[06:35:46] <arschmitz> gseguin: just need like 5 minutes
[06:35:58] <gseguin> cool
[06:38:33] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin 
[06:38:48] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I updated the demos to alpha 2
[06:38:59] <gseguin> hey uGoMobi
[06:39:02] <gseguin> ok cool
[06:39:22] <gseguin> so once arschmitz is done I'll pull and release
[06:40:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: awesome yeah im just waiting for some tests to finish
[06:40:12] <arschmitz> before i commit and push
[06:40:16] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you update package.json when you release, right
[06:40:22] <uGoMobi> ?
[06:40:33] <uGoMobi> I didn't touch that
[06:41:20] <gseguin> the release script updates it for you

[06:48:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome, thanks!
[06:48:10] <arschmitz> yup
[06:48:17] <gseguin> did you run the tests?
[06:48:23] <gseguin> should I ?
[06:48:49] <arschmitz> didnt run full suite just the suites i changed
[06:49:03] <gseguin> I'll just run the unit tests
[06:49:20] <arschmitz> they were very small bug fixes but yeah should run the whole thing before release
[06:51:55] <gseguin> unit tests are passing
[06:52:01] <arschmitz> awesome
[06:52:54] <gseguin> ok releasing
[06:54:47] <uGoMobi> yihaa!
[06:55:35] <gseguin> so now we need the zip to go to the website

[06:55:58] <gseguin> what else?
[07:03:15] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: do I need to tag on codeorigin for it to be published?
[07:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> no

[08:49:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I see that the initSelector in some widgets is in the prototype.
[08:49:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For example button.
[08:49:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, I have completely removed it from collapsible, and it's not placed into the prototype by default.
[08:49:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, where is it to be?
[08:49:51] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: It's not supposed to be auto-injected.
[08:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> There's a defaulut for role = widgetname.
[08:50:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: anything that needs anything besides the default role=widgetname you have to put in to overide
[08:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to use something else, you explicitly put it in the prototype.
[08:50:22] <arschmitz> exactly
[08:50:30] <agcolom> uGoMobi: btw did you release alpha2? is there a blog post?
[08:50:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, well, collapsible doesn't do anything special, and it's not injected into the prototype.
[08:50:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's not supposed to be.
[08:50:57] <arschmitz> right it shouldnt be
[08:51:19] <arschmitz> its only in the prototype if you put it there to over ride the default
[08:51:20] <scott_gonzalez> There's a default for how things are initialized. There's nothing that changes the prototype for you.
[08:51:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so I must know that the default is data-ns-role=collapsible
[08:51:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Understood.
[08:51:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah there is a simple blog post. Would be great if you can take a look at it http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/08/15/jquery-mobile-1-4-0-alpha-2-released/
[08:51:55] <agcolom> uGoMobi: sure, will do now.
[08:52:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks, I will tweet after your feedback
[08:52:41] <uGoMobi> agcolom: and feel free to edit
[08:52:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, the correct way to autoinit things within a scope is $( $.mobile.collapsible.prototype.initSelector || "[data-" + $.mobile.ns + "role='collapsible']" ).collapsible();
[08:53:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right?
[08:53:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry, forgot $( ..., scope ).collapsible();
[08:53:19] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you manually doing an auto-init?
[08:53:33] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: In the unit tests, to make sure that a module works on its own.
[08:53:50] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, I load collapsible via requirejs - no page, no init, nothing - just collapsible.
[08:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> If you're testing a module directly, you shoudln't be mimicking auto-init.
[08:54:10] <arschmitz> why not just add a class then and call .collapsible() on it?
[08:54:13] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Then I wish to run that constructor on the body and check whether the collapsibles have been correctly enhanced.
[08:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> You should be doing something like $( "#collapsible" ).collapsible().
[08:54:41] <scott_gonzalez> Do not mock auto-init to test an individual widget.
[08:54:49] <scott_gonzalez> That defeats the purpose of the separation.
[08:55:31] <_|Nix|_> OK. I can do that. However, how do we then test whether autoinit works correctly for all widgets?
[08:55:42] <scott_gonzalez> You don't.
[08:55:45] <scott_gonzalez> You're not supposed to.
[08:55:52] <scott_gonzalez> You test auto-init as a feature, by itself.
[08:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> With mock widgets.
[08:56:05] <agcolom> uGoMobi: when do you plan on announcing it?
[08:56:11] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, but you gotta make sure that all the widgets have the right structure.
[08:56:16] <scott_gonzalez> No.
[08:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> You make sure that auo-init doesn't care about structure.
[08:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> That's the whole point of the change.
[08:56:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the blog post is live, I can wait with tweeting until you are finished with reviewing it
[08:56:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: all autoinit does is inatialize what ever widgets exist based on their initSelector
[08:57:03] <arschmitz> should not care in anyway about what they actually do
[08:57:04] <agcolom> uGoMobi: should I make the edits directly?
[08:57:11] <agcolom> (or email you?)
[08:57:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: didn't know you were here so I just published
[08:57:29] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, feel free to edit
[08:57:43] <agcolom> ok, will do now. just a few tweaks..
[08:57:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: when in doubt.. I am here, so we can discuss directly
[08:57:53] <agcolom> sure. 
[08:57:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks!
[08:57:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright alright. I'll $( "#id" ).widgetname();
[08:57:58] <agcolom> np :-)
[08:58:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: lol ok or if you need a bunch at once for some reason just use a class
[08:59:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, in the case of button I kinda wanted to make sure I catch all the buttons in the page, because there are so many ways of creating buttons.
[08:59:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I kinda wanted to test the initSelector as well.
[08:59:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but initSelector has no meaning with out autoinit
[09:00:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It makes it easy to catch all the elements that are supposed to become button widegts.
[09:00:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes so does adding a class to all of them :)
[09:00:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no UI widget has an initSelector
[09:01:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The bottom line is: I wanna make sure that js/widgets/forms/button.js works on its own. For now, initSelector is part of js/widgets/forms/button.js.
[09:01:10] <arschmitz> and im pretty sure never will
[09:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: "Works on its own" and "initSelector" are two opposite things.
[09:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> Quite literally opposite.
[09:03:03] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: No, because some random dev can grab button.js, dump it into a perfectly plain js project, and use the initSelector on the prototype in a constructor.
[09:03:25] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: s/plain js/jQuery/
[09:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> That would not be "on its own".
[09:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be integration with some random third party code.
[09:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> When a widget is used on its own, initSelector may as well be ignoreMeIServerNoPurposeWhatsoever.
[09:04:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, then why don't we store all the initSelectors in the autoinit module?
[09:05:14] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That way, all the widgets would be squeaky clean.
[09:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> Because that would make third party widgets impossible.
[09:06:08] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's true.
[09:06:09] <scott_gonzalez> Well, not impossible, but unnecessarily gross.
[09:06:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the whole idea was to make it as simple as possible to drop in any widget and have it work with autoinit
[09:07:10] <arschmitz> that also means if a dev wants to overide the default this should be as easy as possible
[09:09:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OKOK. I'll stop using the initSelector in the individual-modules tests.
[09:11:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, if I don't use the initSelector, I'll be testing whether it correctly creates a button out of an element that may at a future time no longer be covered by the initSelector. So, I'll be testing something that doesn't need to be tested anyway.
[09:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Just test sane things.
[09:12:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but that's only good for when we restrict the scope of a widget. If/when we expand it, the test will need updating anyway.
[09:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> Stop agonizing about unrealistic hypotheticals.
[09:12:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: only worry about the here and now not if a test might change in the future
[09:13:02] <arschmitz> any time you make a change it could effect assumptions made in tests
[09:19:34] <_|Nix|_> WTF is going on with GH? It hangs on push.
[09:19:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: DDOS attack 
[09:19:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Really?
[09:19:57] <arschmitz> yes
[09:19:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow!
[09:20:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How d'you know?
[09:20:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is there a news item somewhere? Somewhere non-DDOS-ed?
[09:20:51] <scott_gonzalez> status.github.com
[09:21:16] <arschmitz> yup that :) ^^
[09:21:39] <_|Nix|_> Dang!
[09:21:48] <_|Nix|_> St00pid script kiddiez ...
[09:24:26] <_|Nix|_> This always makes me think that we should be storing all our project data in the git repo so we can push to one another if GH goes down.
[09:24:47] <_|Nix|_> ... and I mean, including issues.
[09:25:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well you have your local repo so you can continue to work. and issues are not really a showstopper for the short time GH is generally down for
[09:26:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and if you use the github app you can still access all this issues
[09:26:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I now have a perfect label for what I'm doing when I explore such scenarios: I'm "agonizing about unrealistic hypotheticals". Thanks scott_gonzalez :)
[09:26:50] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do your changelogs get generated automatically or semi-auto? (with links to commits and issues?) or is that all manual?
[09:27:12] <arschmitz> agcolom: UI has a script for it 
[09:27:37] <arschmitz> i think we are going to try and adapt it for mobile its just not done yet
[09:27:45] <agcolom> can we have somehting similar too? ( uGoMobi ^ )
[09:27:54] <arschmitz> we used to have a ruby script but its broken
[09:28:47] <arschmitz> so we are just going to adapt ui one once we have time uGoMobi: is that right i have not really delt with this just caught the convo before? 
[09:28:52] <agcolom> that'd be great! because adapting the old changelogs to the new style is crazy business! (some were really long and took me up to 4h for one single very long file!)
[09:29:13] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah we are like in-between right now
[09:29:31] <arschmitz> agcolom: our old one is busted and have not made a new one yet :)
[09:29:34] <uGoMobi> yeah, something for next version
[09:29:53] <uGoMobi> that ruby tool crashed on the amount of changes we made :/
[09:30:09] <uGoMobi> so that wasn't very helpful
[09:30:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ha ha knew there was some problem with it but thats kinda funny 
[09:30:19] <uGoMobi> I will look at the UI script
[09:30:34] <arschmitz> had so many changes it broke then changelog very ironic 
[09:41:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: collapsibleset relies on $.mobile.collapsible.initSelector to initialize its child collapsibles. So, the default is stored on the constructure, whereas the override is stored on the prototype, and, for backcompat the options are also checked?

[10:09:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: Can we mv js/widgets/collapsibleSet.js js/widgets/collapsibleset.js ?
[10:10:33] <_|Nix|_> It's a bit irky that the file name is not the same as the widget name. Really low prio though.
[10:10:54] <_|Nix|_> I guess the same can be said for select. It should be selectmenu.js

[10:18:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: collapsibleSet needs to depend on page, because if it doesn't then nobody will create $.mobile.collapsible.initSelector, which collapsibleset uses to enhance its children.
[10:18:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, we could modify collapsibleset to enhance /all/ its children without filtering them through $.mobile.collapsible.initSelector.
[10:20:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or, we move the $.widget shim code out into its own module, and widgets that access other widgets' initSelector depend on the new module.
[10:21:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I like the former solution better. I don't believe we support adding anything into a collapsibleset that is not a collapsible.
[10:21:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... although currently we leave those elements which do not match the collapsible's initSelector well enough alone.
[10:22:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, I'm not sure whether this leaving-well-enough-alone is an API promise or not.

[10:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: re: "something for next version" regarding changelog. Do you mean the 1.4 final release? Because that's gonna be a killer for agcolom if it's not done by then.
[10:59:22] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: would be nice to work with changelog script for 1.4 beta already, I will check the script you are using for UI
[11:02:00] <uGoMobi> meeting time
[11:03:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: scott_gonzalez: im happy to look at / work on the change log
[11:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi, arschmitz: It's probably a fair amount of work to handle GitHub Issues instead of Trac. But that probably largely depends on how organized the issue tracker is.
[11:05:53] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: that's why I first said next version like 1.5, because I think we need to be more consistent in how we work with tickets, commit messages, etc.
[11:16:26] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: can i get a link to the UI one so i can take a look and see how bad it might be?

[12:06:02] <uGoMobi> will discuss that some other time

[13:08:05] <arschmitz> agcolom: im working on porting the ui changelog hoping to have it for final but no promises :)
[13:08:22] <arschmitz> agcolom: figure it will save you a lot of work
[13:08:35] <agcolom> arschmitz: oh, that sounds really good :-)
[13:09:46] <agcolom> arschmitz: that would be for the new ones only, right? 
[13:10:25] <arschmitz> agcolom: you mean only for new releases?
[13:10:32] <agcolom> ye
[13:10:34] <agcolom> yes
[13:10:46] <arschmitz> yea it will be for anything that happens after its finished
[13:11:02] <agcolom> right, so I can carry on with the old ones?
[13:11:08] <arschmitz> yes
[13:12:18] <arschmitz> agcolom: though in theory i could make it work for any date range
[13:13:09] <agcolom> ok... 
[13:17:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: agcolom : let's discuss how we are going to do this because if we generate a list of all commits we will have 1500+ items
[13:17:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[13:18:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was just thinking about how to filter them for current stuff
[13:18:26] <agcolom> yes, I'm happy to carry on currently with the old ones by hand...
[13:18:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for new ones we just need to add a couple tags
[13:18:52] <arschmitz> and it will be simple
[13:18:54] <agcolom> I think I must have done the worst ones already (I hope ;-) ) 1.3.0 and 1.2.0 were really massive!
[13:19:18] <uGoMobi> the changelogs for the first two alpha releases are very primitive, so I want to do it better at least for final
[13:19:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure what you mean with tags
[13:19:45] <arschmitz> we dont tag things as resolved
[13:19:49] <arschmitz> as far as issues
[13:20:01] <uGoMobi> ah a label in the issue tracker you mean?
[13:20:05] <arschmitz> so we have no idea if an issue is closed fixed / invalid / etc
[13:20:08] <arschmitz> yes
[13:20:11] <uGoMobi> ok clear
[13:20:23] <uGoMobi> yeah, we have to look at our labels as well
[13:20:37] <uGoMobi> but also, we make changes or fix issues that don't have a ticket
[13:20:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also need to make sure anything we close resolved has a milestone
[13:20:43] <uGoMobi> another thing that should change
[13:20:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[13:21:22] <arschmitz> other wise no way to tell between 1.3.2 and 1.4 issues
[13:21:29] <uGoMobi> and remove milestone if we close a ticket but not as fixed
[13:21:54] <arschmitz> thats not as big a deal because if we only pull resolved issues they wont come up
[13:22:17] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[13:22:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: my first thoughts for 1.4 are this
[13:23:01] <arschmitz> only take commits that have a : in them
[13:23:19] <arschmitz> so ones in format component: change
[13:23:39] <arschmitz> then they can at least be catagorized
[13:24:13] <uGoMobi> good idea
[13:24:18] <arschmitz> and if they contain fixed #xxxx pull the issue
[13:24:54] <arschmitz> ignore all other commits
[13:25:13] <arschmitz> and above this to make sure nothing is missed we can clean up our current change log a bit
[13:25:19] <arschmitz> so kinda a hybrid for now
[13:25:26] <arschmitz> and 1.5 go full auto
[13:26:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: other issue is date range vs milestone
[13:26:47] <arschmitz> i think for 1.4 we will just have to use everything in the date range
[13:26:58] <arschmitz> and in 1.5 switch to strict milestones
[13:27:38] <agcolom> we used to say the version for which the commit was when we were not cherry-picking as we go along... that was quite some time ago...
[13:27:52] <agcolom> maybe 1.5 - 2y ago....
[13:28:30] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah that has not been done since i was around so not going to help us now :(
[13:28:42] <arschmitz> agcolom: but thats not a bad idea
[13:29:03] <arschmitz> we should also exclude Demos: and Docs: commits i think
[13:29:22] <jquicommit> 01[13jquery-ui01] 15tjvantoll pushed 1 new commit to 06datepicker: 02http://git.io/OQWeGg

[13:30:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sounds like good solution for 1.4
[13:30:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok its not perfect but i think its the best we can do until 1.5
[13:30:45] <uGoMobi> let's brainstorm about solution for after 1.4 final
[13:31:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok 
[13:32:21] <agcolom> arschmitz: uGoMobi: this is an example: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a71edcbf977d20aae4c8b66b2953e6db0d4d047e 
[13:32:21] <b-ot> agcolom: Anne-Gaelle Colom (15mon 2d ago): Added example on how to dynamically change theme [1.1.1]
[13:32:42] <agcolom> so the version (here 1.1.1) was in square brackets
[13:33:28] <uGoMobi> yeah i remember that we did that
[13:34:12] <agcolom> it's so funny, as I went back through my commits, I discovered that I used to merge uGoMobi's PRs ;-)
[13:34:26] <arschmitz> that could be useful however id like to match ui as close as possible
[13:34:38] <agcolom> arschmitz: I agree! 
[13:34:59] <agcolom> UI has a system that works and we should follow this as much as possible
[13:35:05] <arschmitz> yup
[13:35:24] <agcolom> also, it's good to be consistent across projects where possible
[13:35:41] <arschmitz> for sure
[13:38:43] <arschmitz> i want to try and just make it a grunt task along with the normal release
[13:42:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill git something going that works on a basic level then we can refine from there
[13:44:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great, yeah let's just see what we get when we work with that first version
[13:44:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: how was market
[13:44:46] <uGoMobi> ?
[13:45:00] <agcolom> it was great! 
[13:45:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds like a plan
[13:45:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: should not be too bad i can just use the github api 
[13:45:43] <agcolom> the music this time however wasn't :-(
[13:46:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: aii, well can't have all
[13:46:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6148#issuecomment-22725500 :(
[13:46:28] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6148 by row1e (1mon 5d ago): Panel feature breaks down and die when scrolling fast in IOS 7
[13:46:32] <agcolom> food was great ;-) 
[13:47:09] <uGoMobi> new changelog script should also help to get maintenance releases out every 2-3 week
[13:47:20] <arschmitz> css3 animations combined with crazy scrolling breaks stuff apparently
[13:47:24] <uGoMobi> we have to automate more things
[13:47:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, saw the ticket
[13:48:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ios bug :(
[13:48:21] <uGoMobi> yeah must be because we don't see it on iOS6
[13:48:32] <arschmitz> good that its not our fault but bad that it cant be fixed it would seem
[13:48:53] <arschmitz> the person filed bug with apple so maybe it will get fixed
[13:49:11] <uGoMobi> I thought he said he thought about filing
[13:49:16] <uGoMobi> but didn't actually do it
[13:49:22] <arschmitz> no he updated
[13:49:29] <uGoMobi> you can't search iOS bug tracker, right?
[13:49:35] <uGoMobi> only your own tickets
[13:49:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, I missed that
[13:50:20] <arschmitz> yup
[13:50:32] <arschmitz> i asked them to post any updates they get on the issue
[13:50:55] <arschmitz> they said they would
