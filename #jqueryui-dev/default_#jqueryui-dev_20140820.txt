[07:50:49] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: hi! I want to release an updated version of jquery-simulate
[07:51:00] <mikesherov_> which still has never seen an official release
[07:51:03] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:51:13] <mikesherov_> but I just landed all of the changes that were in UI only into the repo
[07:51:25] <mikesherov_> and I know need one more cahnge to test this phantom IE8 mousemove
[07:51:29] <mikesherov_> so I want to do it the right way
[07:51:50] <mikesherov_> a couple of things need to happen, we need to release a version of jquery simulate
[07:52:14] <mikesherov_> and then we need to externalize it
[07:52:30] <mikesherov_> do you have some time today to help me do that?
[07:52:51] <mikesherov_> I feel the noose tightening on draggable
[07:53:00] <mikesherov_> I'd like to get it under 10 bugs
[07:53:22] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: ^
[07:54:02] <scott_gonzalez> After the meetings would work
[07:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> Dev leads is today, so any time after 2:00p
[07:54:57] <mikesherov_> OK, so for fixing this bug, I'm going to just make the change in current jquery.simulate that's inside of UI
[07:55:03] <mikesherov_> and then later today we can externalize it
[07:55:26] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:57:07] <mikesherov_> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10563#comment:1
[08:02:24] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: can you review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1318 ?
[08:02:37] <mikesherov_> or should I have tj_vantoll1 do it?
[08:03:18] <scott_gonzalez> So this worked properly in Firefox?
[08:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> If the visual test case works properly in Firefox, go ahead and land it.
[08:15:46] <mikesherov_> yeah, it works in FF
[08:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> ok, cool
[08:16:05] <mikesherov_> I'll recheck one last time in all browsers, just curious, scott_gonzalez why do you think it would fail in FF?
[08:16:05] <scott_gonzalez> PR looks good to land then.
[08:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> http://dev-test.nemikor.com/behavior/mouseover-when-element-is-shown.html
[08:17:02] <scott_gonzalez> I assume Firefox provides the correct button value though.
[08:18:46] <mikesherov_> right, so the old code only detected the bad behaviro in IE8
[08:18:59] <mikesherov_> and actually, this PR would fix FF if it WAS broken
[08:19:10] <mikesherov_> but it isn't because we do the mouseup firing only in IE8
[08:19:20] <mikesherov_> ok, landing
[08:19:50] <scott_gonzalez> Right, my concern was if Firefox had the same bad behavior as IE8.
[08:19:56] <scott_gonzalez> Since the second half of the check is being an IE check.
[08:20:12] <mikesherov_> I see
[08:20:24] <mikesherov_> If I remove the document mode check, I can likely get FF to fail without my fix
[08:20:42] <mikesherov_> although, no
[08:20:48] <mikesherov_> FF does mouseover
[08:20:56] <mikesherov_> IE8 does MOUSEMOVE O_o

[11:11:08] <arschmitz> gseguin: you talking about his gist?
[11:11:15] <gseguin> arschmitz: yeah
[11:11:29] <arschmitz> thats modified by mine we have been working on it together
[11:11:46] <gseguin> oh ok
[11:11:49] <arschmitz> he gave me the idea to use the special events api
[11:11:59] <gseguin> what's the single source of truth though?
[11:12:02] <arschmitz> i had sent him a link to it when i was finished
[11:12:17] <arschmitz> and he sent me back that gist as a suggestion to test
[11:12:58] <arschmitz> so i need to test something and based on that ill update my pr
[11:13:13] <gseguin> cool
[11:13:20] <arschmitz> thats why i had not landed it yet
[11:13:58] <arschmitz> gseguin: from what dave was reading its not just things on document
[11:14:11] <gseguin> arschmitz: I was thinking it was very much looking like an issue we'd been trying to solve for a while
[11:14:13] <arschmitz> its anything overlapping at all so we need to track every element 
[11:14:42] <gseguin> hmm... interesting!
[11:15:16] <arschmitz> gseguin: so thats what i need to test better
[11:15:39] <gseguin> can you add a test case?
[11:15:47] <arschmitz> thats what im going to do
[11:15:51] <gseguin> cool

[12:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: We've been trying to collaborate with Bootstrap and create a standalone CSS framework that's used by multiple projects (essentially a CSS equivalent of Sizzle). We've been talking to fat and mdo, but they've been pretty unresponsive. Perhaps you can encourage them to actually talk to us again.
[12:28:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[12:28:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[12:30:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[12:30:11] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7633 expected behaviour?
[12:30:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I would suspect so, since AFAIK the browser doesn't re-initialize the page if you http away from it. When you come back, it restores the state without reloading the page.
[12:31:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I also suspect that the extra pagechange in Chrome is because of the spurious popstate at the beginning.
[12:31:43] <arschmitz> yeah thats why you can go to a page and go back and still have your forms filled in etc
[12:31:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[12:31:57] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I'm inclined to close this as not a bug.
[12:32:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: though if i recal chrome is the one with the correct behivor here
[12:32:25] <arschmitz> there should be a pop i believe
[12:33:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, yeah, because there's been a nav event. Though I'm not sure how that's supposed to be handled across state barriers.
[12:33:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but regardless close 
[12:33:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, because either way you're not gonna have the whole pagebeforeshow thing, because the page is already renderded.

[12:38:05] <arschmitz> yup

[12:38:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. I'll comment to that effect.
[12:38:38] <gabriel_schulhof> I wonder if FF also has these events.
[12:38:40] <arschmitz> they recomend pagehide
[12:38:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Are they standard?
[12:38:44] <arschmitz> yes
[12:38:47] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[12:39:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/pageshow
[12:39:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh sorry its document not window
[12:40:34] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, but then wait a second! Why aren't they getting triggered on http://jsfiddle.net/z7akthvf/3/show/light/?
[12:40:45] <gabriel_schulhof> I /am/ attaching a handler to the document there.
[12:41:21] <gabriel_schulhof> ... to pageshow.
[12:41:43] <gabriel_schulhof> So, if there's a native event named "pageshow", I should be getting it upon returning to the page, but I'm not getting it.
[12:41:57] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: hey
[12:42:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hmm even though that says doc they only work on window lol
[12:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1288#issuecomment-49437200 What exactly are you worried about regressing?
[12:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> The base widget or individual widgets?
[12:44:50] <tj_vantoll> Individual
[12:44:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: *sigh* ... typical
[12:45:03] <tj_vantoll> The cases where individual widgets need to explicitly clean up.
[12:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...I'm not thrilled about checking internal properties in unit tests for individual widgets.
[12:46:02] <tj_vantoll> My comment was me thinking out loud about how we could test those changes.
[12:46:11] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I'm not either.
[12:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> Especially since the tests will be ugly.
[12:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'd expect each individual widget would have a section with a comment about avoiding memory leaks.
[12:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we'd end up regressing.
[12:47:20] <tj_vantoll> Also regressing isn't *that* big of a deal, if it did happen.
[12:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I'll go ahead and put together a PR to actually land.
[12:48:07] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: http://jsbin.com/kezuqu/4
[12:48:14] <scott_gonzalez> And there won't be any tests.
[12:48:24] <tj_vantoll> It'd be great if we had some way to automate checks for this sort of thing, but I don't think it's really feasible.
[12:48:29] <tj_vantoll> So that sounds good.
[12:49:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'd be nice if we could detect leaks during our tests.
