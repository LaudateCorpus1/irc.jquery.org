[06:30:42] <scott_gonzalez> Why do people think that accordions are a good way to organize large chunks of content?
[06:58:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is there anything we need a thurough test sweep on besides cover transitions and flipswitch that you know about? 
[06:58:11] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i remember a time where i thought that and used it on a site
[06:58:26] <arschmitz> about 6 months later i realized how wrong i was and removed them all 
[06:58:43] <scott_gonzalez> Do you remember what made you think it was a good idea?
[06:59:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: panels after I am done with bug fixes
[06:59:43] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: honestly no in general if you want that sort of thing collapsibles make much more sense to me
[06:59:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and filterable although I think that weren't platform specific issues
[07:00:13] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: really why does it matter to close one when another is opened ?
[07:00:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok cool 
[07:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, accordions are really designed for small spaces with little data.
[07:01:00] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably have better demos for UI :-/
[07:01:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah i mean unless your content MUST maintain a specific height they dont make sense to me
[07:02:18] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: but generally when i see accordions used there is no requirement of a static height
[07:47:17] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi :-)
[07:47:39] <agcolom> How do I get rid of agcolom_ >

[08:19:54] <agcolom> hi, sorry internet is on and off... (stormy weather)
[08:23:52] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: if that was a question, the answer is yes
[08:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: The other user is from irccloud.
[08:24:33] <scott_gonzalez> I've never used it, so I don't know what you need to do to make it stop.
[08:24:46] <agcolom> ok, I'll investigate...

[18:06:01] <arschmitz> hi
[18:06:13] <paul_irish> the 1.3.2 zip you sent me
[18:06:24] <paul_irish> has versions in the filenames :)
[18:07:54] <paul_irish> soo... we can make the changes over here
[18:07:56] <arschmitz> ok ill have to get you a new one it was not suposed to have them but its auto generated by our release script and something must have not worked
[18:08:01] <paul_irish> and recalculate hashes for the manifest
[18:08:11] <paul_irish> but i think both of us would be more comfortable if you did it :)
[18:08:12] <arschmitz> oh ok ill make sure we get it fixed with the next one
[18:08:19] <arschmitz> ok no problem
[18:08:23] <paul_irish> sweet
[18:08:43] <paul_irish> thank you sir.
[18:08:50] <paul_irish> apologies for the delay
[18:09:02] <arschmitz> what ever works best for you guys it was supposed to be free of versions but was the first time we had used new script
[18:09:15] <paul_irish> aye
[18:09:26] <arschmitz> probably should have checked first :)
[18:10:53] <arschmitz> just so i know its right this time the only thing different you want is you just want the file names versionless is that right?
[18:11:50] <paul_irish> yes
[18:11:56] <paul_irish> including the references to the sourcemaps
[18:12:23] <arschmitz> ok
