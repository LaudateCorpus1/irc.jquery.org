[04:33:38] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: gabriel_schulhof is working on updating table still it uses checkboxradio
[04:34:00] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ah ok
[04:35:54] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Are we still unifying ui-listview-inset and ui-collapsible-inset into simply ui-inset?
[04:36:40] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: arschmitz needs to fix checkboxradio in UI and then grab a newer version. I'll then attend to the rest of the tests, which should also fix the demos.
[04:37:15] <gabriel_schulhof> The reason I ask about inset is that we need to decide whether inset is a theme option or a widget-specific structural class.
[04:37:16] <jasperdegroot> gabriel_schulhof: yeah, I think that's still the plan. There is a ticket for it with milestone 1.5 and assigned to me.

[06:19:12] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. How did you do that?
[06:19:22] <arschmitz> added .html to the link
[06:19:25] <gabriel_schulhof> It's not in the markup, AFAICT.
[06:19:30] <arschmitz> yes it is
[06:19:55] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I'm losing my mind.
[06:20:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec ... yours doesn't have a trailing slash on the href.
[06:20:42] <arschmitz> nope
[06:22:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it should also work with a setting in ajax setup but its not working i might be doning something wrong though
[06:22:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, it was working and now the link you gave me above is broken.
[06:23:02] <arschmitz> i changed it
[06:23:05] <gabriel_schulhof> The point is it should work without having to do anything special.
[06:23:12] <arschmitz> no it shouldnt
[06:23:24] <arschmitz> its integral to how jsbin works that it be this way
[06:23:46] <arschmitz> and its always been this way it was actually a bug it ever worked at all 
[06:24:27] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. I see. You have to set the href to /vivado/1.html
[06:24:32] <gabriel_schulhof> That's cool.
[06:24:47] <arschmitz> yes
[06:24:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess you can't test JSON responses otherwise.
[06:25:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the json is what actually creats the jsbin your loading

[07:32:14] <ldeluca> Hey, anyone know if it's possible to look at the console output from a browserstack session?  I can reproduce an issue in browserstack but I'm not sure how to debug
[07:32:48] <arschmitz> ldeluca: i dont know how if you can 
[07:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> ldeluca: I don't think you can get the console output, but using the API you can take a screnshot.
[07:34:06] <scott_gonzalez> So you could log to the page and get a screenshot of it.
[07:36:40] <ldeluca> yea, i can prove the problem exists (reproduce) but i'm trying to test out my changes and it's time consuming and painful to test each little thing.  It'd be nice to be able to edit the code within browser stack like any browser dev tool.  Just was curious if anyone else had a good technique they use.  
[07:37:06] <scott_gonzalez> Are you using a tunnel?
[07:37:29] <ldeluca> no, just static files i'm pointing browserstack to locally
[07:37:45] <scott_gonzalez> You can connect directly to files on your local machine and then actually use the dev tools in browserstack. That's the easiest way to test.
[07:38:07] <ldeluca> dev tools in browserstack?  where do i find those? 
[07:38:26] <scott_gonzalez> Just the regular dev tools in whichever browser you're using inside browserstack.
[07:38:39] <ldeluca> ah, okay, let me give that a try
[07:38:44] <ldeluca> thanks scott_gonzalez
[07:39:00] <scott_gonzalez> Here's a list of all the tools they install on their browsers: http://www.browserstack.com/developer-tools
[07:40:19] <ldeluca> ohh, i get it now.  I thought you meant i could use my regular chrome dev tools when running browserstack in chrome.  Unfortunately i'm testing on an android webview
[07:40:26] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ldeluca i dont think those will help on mobile devices
[07:40:27] <ldeluca> not on a browser
[07:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, that I'm not sure about. I can ping them about it and see if they have any tips.
[07:41:59] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: that would be awesome if there was a way it would be pretty useful

[09:05:10] <ldeluca> how come on the demos page there are no examples of popups using buttons
[09:05:20] <ldeluca> is buttons not the supported way of creating popups?
[09:05:37] <ldeluca> i only ask because i'm debugging and issue that was open that only happens with button style popups, not link style
[09:06:23] <arschmitz> ldeluca: when you say opened from a button do you mean attaching aclick handler to the button and using the popup open method?
[09:06:57] <ldeluca> yes
[09:07:26] <arschmitz> ldeluca: if your calling the open method your self any way is supported essentially
[09:08:40] <ldeluca> okay, i'll keep debugging then.  it's almost like there are styles being applied to the popup rather than the button/link.  very very strange :)

[11:57:45] <ldeluca> oh look at that nifty little auto message :)
[12:11:07] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Ping!
[12:11:26] <ldeluca> hi gabriel_schulhof
[12:12:27] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Hey! Looking at your solution. While I don't doubt that it works, I was just thinking ... do you think you could try, instead of focusing the container belatedly to blur() the currently active element if such an element is not a child of the popup container?
[12:13:48] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I ask because blur()ing may be doable without introducing a timeout. Timeouts are generally bad, because they're, like impossible to test reliably, and they can introduce bugs that are hard to track down because their appearance depends on the real-time condition of the system.
[12:14:15] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Our goal is to prevent one being able to reach focusable widgets that are not children of the popup container.
[12:14:52] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Bluring such a widget upon popup display will accomplish that (I hope), because if you later attempt to focus anything, the document-level focus-listener will redirect that to the popup widget.
[12:15:25] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: that makes sense. so are you saying to try doing a blur instead of a focus() call?  What appears to be happening is the default browser styling for a focus is applied to the popup which is causing the blue or orange look
[12:15:38] <ldeluca> I tried playing with the styles to remove the outline: none but I never could get the style of the popup
[12:16:17] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: You want to look at the .ui-popup-container rule, because that's the class for this._ui.container. However, if that doesn't work, then please try the blur.
[12:16:45] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: _handleDocumentFocusIn should give you an example of how one decides whether an element is a child of the popup container or not.
[12:16:46] <ldeluca> yea, i tried .ui-popup-container and .ui-popup-container:focus
[12:17:46] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: You may even wish to factor out the code that makes that decision into a separate widget-level function, to be used by both _handleDocumentFocusIn and _openPrerequisitesComplete
[12:17:53] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: not really following what you mean by deciding if it's a child of the popup.  It's the popup itself that is causing the problems.  so the .focus() is causing the default browser styling.  how am i supposed to use the blur?  applying that to the same object that .focus() is called on?
[12:18:10] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: No.
[12:18:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Instead of this._ui.container.focus(), you determine which element currently has the focus, and then, if that element is not a child of this._ui.container, then you blur that element.
[12:19:24] <ldeluca> ah, so basically causing the popup to gain focus because we're taking away focus from all of the others?
[12:19:56] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I don't believe that will give the popup focus, but it will take focus away from whatever may have the focus that is not part of the popup.
[12:20:32] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: ... which, in combination with _handleDocumentFocusIn, will accomplish our focus restriction without having to actively change focus immediately after displaying the popup.
[12:20:41] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or so I hope.
[12:21:30] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: sounds complicated :)  Let me play
[12:21:35] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[12:24:54] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Another minor thing: Please set your text editor indentation to always use tab characters, and tell it to display a single tab character as 4 spaces.
[12:25:31] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/
[12:28:06] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: know how to do that with Brackets?  not seeing a preferences page.  I'll google...
[12:28:24] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: No, sorry :)
[12:35:00] <ldeluca> changed, gracias
[12:35:11] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Awesome!
[12:39:26] <ldeluca> alright gabriel_schulhof... sorry, you might have to do some handholding since this is my first real issue that I'm looking into
[12:39:47] <ldeluca> it looks like based ont he code that the _openPrerequisitesComplete method already has the element (the popup element) 
[12:40:13] <ldeluca> so i'm not following why i'd have to look to make sure it's a child of the parent popup when it is... unless I"m reading the code wrong
[12:41:32] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: _openPrerequisitesComplete() runs as soon as the popup opening animation has completed. At that point in time, you must blur the focussed element if that element is not a child of the popup container.
[12:42:08] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: You can see from _openPrereqsComplete that a good way of retrieving the element that currently has the focus is to use this.document[ 0 ].activeElement.
[12:43:27] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: So, you can replace this._ui.container.focus() with a $( this.document[ 0 ].activeElement ).blur() conditional upon the fact that this.document[ 0 ].activeElement is not a child of this._ui.container.
[12:43:55] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: ... and hopefully that modification will do the trick.
[12:44:23] <arschmitz> ldeluca: if you do that you need to also check to make sure this.document[ 0 ].activeElement is not the window
[12:44:46] <ldeluca> okay, thanks, let me stare at this for a bit
[12:44:51] <arschmitz> ldeluca: or in ie if it is window it will send the window to the background
[12:45:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, wow! OK. Good catch!
[12:56:06] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: var nodename = $( this.document[ 0 ].activeElement ).nodeName.toLowerCase(); I'm getting the node name to compare to see if it's window or body
[12:56:22] <ldeluca> but toLowerCase says it can't be called on undefined.  I'm assuming that just means that no windows are currently active
[12:56:43] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: It's easier to just this.document[ 0 ].activeElement !== this.window[ 0 ]
[12:57:02] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Widget instances get this.document and this.window from the widget factory.
[12:57:23] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Both of those are jQuery objects containing the document resp. the window.
[12:57:29] <ldeluca> ah, okay
[13:27:12] <ldeluca> is browserstack every painfully slow for anyone else with the android testing?
[13:27:27] <ldeluca> every == ever
[13:28:05] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Yes. Waaay slow. I've installed the SDK locally.
[13:28:38] <ldeluca> ah, that's a good idea.  maybe i'll try genymotion
[14:40:02] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: so I tested the fix with the blur on a genymotion vm and it appears to be working.  never could get browserstack to update
[14:40:12] <ldeluca> should i do a new pull request for you to checkout?
[14:43:35] <arschmitz> ldeluca: yes please or just update your current one either way
[14:51:46] <ldeluca> okay, updated the existing one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7757
