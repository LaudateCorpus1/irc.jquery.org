[07:04:44] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Hello Jörn, I have some updates
[07:12:39] <jzaefferer> hey rxaviers
[07:14:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I will update the wiki documentation. If you want to take a look for now, what I have so far is at https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui
[07:17:19] <jzaefferer> cool
[07:17:26] <jzaefferer> can you replace _init with _create?
[07:17:43] <jzaefferer> _init gets called everytime you call .editable() on an element, _create just once
[07:18:48] <jzaefferer> there's more like that - could you send a pull request against master? doesn't has to be merged now, just for doing code review
[07:21:05] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, :) nice.. I will make that change and will
[07:21:11] <rxaviers> make the pull request
[07:21:39] <jzaefferer> thanks
[07:21:53] <rxaviers> ywc, actually thank you :)
[08:53:05] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, just to let you know, I will be able to do it at night...
[08:53:24] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:31:15] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to mask: http://git.io/dLuemQ
[09:31:15] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/mask] Mask: Remove some unused variables and unnecessary else statements - Jörn Zaefferer
[12:11:14] <jzaefferer> gnarf? GNARF?
[12:18:08] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i merged your refactoring and made changes based on your comments on that menu pull. let me know what you think. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/442
[12:18:09] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (3w, 3d ago): Menu: Add support for structures other than UL/LI
[12:38:14] <jzaefferer> kborchers: did you verify that menubar is still working after your changes?
[12:43:18] <kborchers> the demo still seemed ok. i have noticed that if i move my mouse quickly from the menubar into a menu, occasionally the menu dissappears but that was present before my changes and can be reproduced on http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/menubar/default.html
[12:43:44] <kborchers> otherwise, menubar appears to still be working properly on my instance with my changes to menu
[13:09:42] <gnarf> jzaefferer: srry we keep missing each other
[13:09:45] <gnarf> you still around?
[13:09:53] <gnarf> life has been hectic last month or so
[13:10:04] <gnarf> haven't had much time
[13:10:12] <gnarf> but I'm hoping to give you a timepicker tonight
[13:25:59] <jzaefferer> hey, yeah, kind of still around
[13:26:18] <jzaefferer> currently trying to build a tweet-size webserver in nodejs that returns a twitter id for a given twitter handle
[13:26:29] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jzaefferer/tweet-id
[13:26:36] <jzaefferer> currently down to 180 bytes
[13:27:00] <jzaefferer> pretty much stuck
[13:27:28] <jzaefferer> anyway, would be good to get that caret positioning issue fixed in Mask
[13:27:58] <jzaefferer> I dug around a bit but the combo of _parseValue and _seekRight is, well, odd
[13:28:13] <jzaefferer> the −1 offset is kind of obvious culprit, but needed for an empty value
[13:28:51] <jzaefferer> other then that, yeah, a timepicker prototype would be sweet
[13:30:05] <gnarf> yeah
[13:30:10] <gnarf> im gonna change that up a bit
[13:30:11] <gnarf> i think
[13:31:22] <gnarf> i had this random idea that making a new helper to call caret might make it easier
[13:31:45] <gnarf> the seeks are a little messy
[13:31:46] <gnarf> etc
[13:32:09] <gnarf> but i should have a good chunk of time tonight for mask/timepicking
[13:32:36] <gnarf> assuming my tooth doesn't start trying to scream its way out of my mouth again
[13:32:41] <gnarf> (( hate tooth pain ))
[13:33:17] <gnarf> was gonna work on it last night - but by the time I finished up my core 1.7 pulls it was hurting too much to think straight
[13:35:14] <gnarf> anyway - speaking of hectic - i have to go file some paperwork with the county RE my house.... bbiab
[14:48:58] <jzaefferer> gnarf: hope your teeth get better soon
