[06:48:44] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish gnarf Krinkle|detached: It's in UI core.
[06:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that there's any other way to detect.
[06:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, we can version sniff, but...
[06:54:47] <scott_gonzalez> We can skip the check and just overwrite core's implementation.
[06:55:03] <scott_gonzalez> But I really like leaving core alone when we can.
[07:29:48] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: did you see this? https://twitter.com/csuwldcat/status/308972562635972609
[07:29:49] <b-ot> kborchers: @csuwldcat: The Web Components Custom Elements API, document.register, just landed in Mozilla/WebKit - it's one API for DOM, one giant leap for Webkind!
[07:30:15] <kborchers> getting closer :)
[07:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> I did not.
[07:30:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but it's not something we can even use in UI for like 3 or 4 more years :-(
[07:31:27] <kborchers> concurrent 2.0 and 3.0 where 3.0 can use cool stuff? ;)
[07:31:59] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, very doubtful.
[07:32:12] <kborchers> yeah
[07:32:30] <scott_gonzalez> It might actually need to be a completely new project.
[07:33:03] <kborchers> yeah, maybe
[07:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I'd like to get that sortable fix landed so we can release 1.10.2.
[07:34:38] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I can do it tongiht
[07:34:42] <scott_gonzalez> great
[07:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> We need this: http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown
[07:48:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: are you being serious? like adding a widget for that? isn't it basically a combo of selectmenu and autocomplete with some custom rendering?
[07:48:51] <kborchers> or you mean the delay stuff
[07:48:53] <kborchers> ?
[07:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> I mean the delay logic.
[07:49:02] <kborchers> ah ok
[07:49:06] <kborchers> that makes more sense :)
[07:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:49:32] <kborchers> yeah that is nice
[07:50:21] <kborchers> i thought we basically did that
[07:51:06] <scott_gonzalez> We just have a generic delay.
[07:51:58] <kborchers> oh i see
[07:51:59] <scott_gonzalez> Notice the amazon submenus change instantly if you're moving your mouse straight up and down.
[07:52:06] * kborchers actually reads it
[07:53:23] <kborchers> they are still using delay though too
[07:53:44] <kborchers> yeah
[07:53:46] <kborchers> it's nice
[07:53:50] <kborchers> we should do that
[07:54:14] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9138
[07:54:27] <kborchers> cool
[08:07:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: meeting?
[08:15:08] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:15:29] <scott_gonzalez> Probably just go over what we discussed in person on Monday.
[08:18:16] <gnarf> oops i forgot to re-enable the auto timezone
[08:18:23] <gnarf> here i was working and it was already meeting time ;)
[08:21:27] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[08:22:08] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: "Pointer Events - Kris to prototype" what does that mean?
[08:22:52] <jzaefferer> I guess we can discuss the grunt stuff at the meeting
[08:23:03] <jzaefferer> or whenever you, Rafael and me are around at the same time
[08:23:17] <jzaefferer> I can't tell if this is about UI's grunt build or only about download builder
[08:24:08] <kborchers> jzaefferer: means mapping mouse, touch and MSPointer to our own Pointer special event so we can encourage everyone to just use pointer with UI then we're ready when pointer wins and we can just drop the special event is the tl;dr
[08:25:32] <jzaefferer> kborchers: so polyfill pointer events? Or only special event within jQuery?
[08:25:53] <kborchers> i understood as just special event in jQuery
[08:25:59] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-_on is missing the supressDisabledCheck flag, right?
[08:40:38] <gnarf> jzaefferer: you gonna be able to stick around for dev leads meeting?
[08:42:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers: Yes, just special event. A generic polyfill isn't possible for the browsers we support.
[08:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> There are existing projects with "native" polyfill as their goal.
[08:43:13] <scott_gonzalez> A jQuery-specific implementation is much simpler.
[08:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, it's missing the flag.
[09:11:50] <jzaefferer> gnarf scott_gonzalez: No, won't be around for the devleads meeting :/ Have to leave now. Maybe we can at least consider moving the UI meeting to an earlier time, that would help...
[09:12:55] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i already have a hard enough time getting to the UI meeting, i suppose making it earler won't change much for me ;)
[09:13:10] <jzaefferer> heh
[09:13:11] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:13:23] <jzaefferer> this used to be easier for me
[09:15:44] <kborchers> earlier UI meeting would conflict with a weekly meeting i have right before
[13:11:38] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez re the question boris posed ... i am not sure who/what is choosing to hide/expose and who is choosing to opt in
[13:50:26] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/5938/include-branch-and-tag-information-for what we were looking for at the hotel yesterday
