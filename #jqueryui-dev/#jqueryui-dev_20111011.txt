[07:05:00] <kborchers> jzaefferer: you have any thoughts on this as a solution to the mouseover allows keyboard nav issue in Menu? https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/40752aac6a42f44d16329152a64150b29b43e82c
[07:05:00] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by kborchers (9h, 54m ago): Menu: Added focus and blur of anchor element to provide keyboard functionality after mouse activation of the menu
[07:16:25] <kborchers> i don't like how browsers highlight each element since it has focus but it was the only way i could come up with to get the keyboard to know it needs to start from that spot when you press a key
[07:17:59] <jzaefferer> kborchers: moving focus to menu items goes against the idea to keep focus on the menu itself so that screenreaders have some context of the "surrounding" menu, then using activedescendent to figure out the active item
[07:18:26] <jzaefferer> if this affects only mouse handling, its probably fine, if it also affects keyboard usage, it isn't
[07:18:43] <jzaefferer> what about moving focus to the (parent) menu instead of the item?
[07:19:07] <jzaefferer> also, how does that affect autocomplete, where focus is on the input while using cursor up/down to navigate?
[07:19:40] <kborchers> had not tested autocomplete, i will do some more testing
[07:19:53] <kborchers> moving focus to the menu focuses the first element by design though
[07:20:05] <kborchers> "focuses"
[07:20:32] <kborchers> not actual focus but makes the first element active
[07:20:56] <kborchers> which steals it from where the mouse is at
[07:21:10] <jzaefferer> well, that happens within menu, so we could prevent it
[07:21:16] <jzaefferer> not sure if we should go there...
[07:22:06] <kborchers> i think we need it to activate the first element so tabbing to the menu allows for further keyboard interaction right?
[07:22:27] <kborchers> i wouldn't want to break that
[07:22:58] <jzaefferer> just "prevent" it when setting focus to the menu from within menu itself, that's what I was trying to say
[07:23:21] <jzaefferer> this.ignoreFocusEvent = true; then check for that within the focus event handler, some crap like that...
[07:23:57] <kborchers> oh, i see. i actually was doing something like that but was trying to avoid creating "flags" all over the place. feels like i do that a lot
[07:25:08] <kborchers> ok, i'll work in that direction and see where we get. thanks for the input
[07:25:17] <jzaefferer> okay, a PR would be good for that
[07:25:34] <kborchers> ok, when i have something i will make a pr
[07:25:46] <jzaefferer> we managed to make menu a nice little abstraction for a lot other widgets, but that also means we have to be very careful when changing it

[11:35:39] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from gnarf37: @scott_gonzalez How many devs realize they are designing APIs? :) ★ http://bit.ly/nT2hEO
[11:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> people suck at crafting usable code
[11:39:33] <rwaldron> haha
[11:45:37] <gnarf> (re)usable
[11:50:18] <kborchers> so, mouse event handling on Menu is all done without ever moving focus to any part of the menu. this makes keyboard nav of the menu after using the mouse to "activate" a portion of the menu not work
[11:50:32] <kborchers> this is easily fixed by focusing the menu or an  item in the menu
[11:50:49] <kborchers> problem is, this breaks autocomplete which relies on the input to keep focus.
[11:50:52] <kborchers>  thoughts?
[12:00:01] <gnarf> hrm
[12:01:00] <gnarf> override the _focus in the autocomplete to focus the input, proxy the keyboard events from the input back to the menu?
[12:01:21] <gnarf> like override the menus focus function in autocomplete
[12:02:16] <gnarf> also perhaps allowing the "focusitem" to be set by autocomplete
[12:02:31] <gnarf> the "focusitem" being the element that has focus to capture keyboard events in the menu
[12:29:38] <kborchers> thanks gnarf. i've only been exploring from the menu side and not from the autocomplete side so this may be the way to go
[12:30:21] <kborchers> gnarf: and here's that new :focus example. same basic idea just not teaching $("*").live() https://gist.github.com/1279093 unless we should just completely rewrite it as something else though i think this works
[12:54:46] <gnarf> kborchers: updated that api page again, now with whitespace
[12:55:10] <kborchers> oooohhh, pretty
[12:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> does anyone ever create gists from diffs just so you can view it in a nicer format?
[13:01:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yes, im the one that suggested that to you
[13:01:18] <gnarf> :)
[13:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> oh, heh :-P
[13:01:53] <scott_gonzalez> I've got something for you: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/pretty-diff
[13:02:28] <gnarf> ooo
[13:04:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: usage?
[13:04:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cuz git pretty-diff head master doesn't work
[13:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> works for me
[13:07:55] <gnarf> hrm
[13:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> what happened when you ran that?
[13:09:01] <gnarf> hot shit
[13:09:04] <gnarf> i fixed it
[13:09:21] <gnarf> im not gonna tell you what was wrong
[13:09:28] <gnarf> :)
[13:09:34] <gnarf> but super hot shit
[13:09:46] <gnarf> now make it post it as a gist with --gist
[13:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[13:10:20] <gnarf> or even gist-diff
[13:10:23] <gnarf> cuz like
[13:10:29] <gnarf> sometimes i just wanna share it
[13:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I'll work on that
[17:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://gist.github.com/1279826 created from a node script
[17:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> looks like it'll be tricky to do it under your account
[17:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> since you'll need to store your password in the settings
[17:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> or we'll need to use OAuth
[17:02:49] <gnarf> hrm
[17:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> it'd be nice if we could just send the public key

[19:11:24] <gnarf> boooooooo
[19:11:26] <gnarf> NOOOOOOOOO
[19:59:18] <kborchers> anyone around to take a peek at this and give thoughts? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/495
[19:59:19] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (27.37s ago): Menu: Allow keyboard navigation of the Menu after it has been activated by mouse
[20:20:40] <gnarf> kborchers: interesting
[20:20:42] <gnarf> does it work?
[20:22:39] <kborchers> seems to work in visual tests and units still pass in chrome and FF (haven't tested IE's)
[20:25:12] <kborchers> not a huge fan of adding the keydown binding to document but it was necessary to flip the flag and allow the focus
[20:30:30] <gnarf> hrm
[20:31:11] <gnarf> would it make sense to have a this.focus.focus()
[20:31:16] <gnarf> instead of this.element.focus()
[20:31:33] <gnarf> then you could this.menu.focus = this.element;
[20:31:36] <gnarf> from the autocomplete
[20:32:16] <gnarf> then it could bind the key events to this.focus too
[20:47:02] <kborchers> gnarf: sorry i was on a call with paul telling him how boring my life is managing forms and PHP and doing no client side dev and spending all of my time hacking UI instead of working
[20:47:14] <kborchers> that's an interesting idea
[20:47:17] <gnarf> paul?
[20:47:23] <kborchers> irish
[20:47:23] <gnarf> the irish?
[20:47:47] <gnarf> aww, i never got a personal call from paul
[20:47:48] <gnarf> ;)
[20:48:21] <kborchers> he asked if i had a minute to chat. wanted to know about browser tooling and making front end dev's lives easier ... to which i had no good feedback as my dev life is boring right now :(
[20:48:51] <gnarf> ahh
[20:49:24] <kborchers> he said he would be picking you grid guys brains soon though
[20:50:43] <gnarf> i was just complaining that you were having sexy sexy chat with kborchers
[20:50:47] <gnarf> and not me
[20:50:48] * gnarf grins
[21:04:10] <gnarf> kborchers: still thinking about that "focus" thing?
[21:04:22] <kborchers> yeah
[21:04:34] <gnarf> might wanna check with the guys at the meeting
[21:04:42] <gnarf> or just in general tomorrow
[21:05:40] <gnarf> im just throwing out integration possibilities
[21:05:41] <kborchers> yeah, that was why i went with the PR so that folks could look ... something about the way it is now bothers me. it works but it feels a little dirty you know?
[21:05:52] <gnarf> ?twss
[21:05:52] <bot-t> <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[21:06:00] <kborchers> heh
[21:06:15] <gnarf> yeah, i think setting the "focus" element makes more sense
[21:06:34] <gnarf> that way keyboard interaction can be bound there too
[21:06:54] <gnarf> if it can be done as an "option"
[21:07:22] <kborchers> for some reason i always shy away from adding options
[21:07:28] <gnarf> i must agree
[21:07:58] <gnarf> but the "focus" var on the data doesn't feel as dirty as a flag
[21:08:13] <kborchers> yeah
[21:08:13] <gnarf> but need some way to bind key events right?
[21:08:20] <gnarf> maybe on open
[21:08:31] <gnarf> it can bind/unbind the events?
[21:08:35] <gnarf> nah
[21:08:38] <gnarf> lame
