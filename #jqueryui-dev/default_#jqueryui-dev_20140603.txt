[02:19:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: are you going to create a new branch for checkboxradio and create a PR against style-option-deprecation?
[02:19:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so that everything that lands in style-option-deprecation has been reviewed already
[02:52:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[02:52:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and we'll have a final review when we land the branch.
[02:52:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok great
[03:08:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do we have a class that negates ui-mini?
[03:09:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no
[03:09:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can add ui-mini to a controlgroup, and all the widgets inside will be mini, but what if you want one not to be?
[03:09:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that will cause layout issues
[03:10:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the not-mini button will be higher than the others
[03:10:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How do you mean?
[03:10:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not in a vertical controlgroup.
[03:11:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, of course it will be taller even in a vertical controlgroup, but it won't break the edges of the controlgroup like in a horizontal controlgroup.
[03:11:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there it will not cause issues but still it would look weird to have on big button in a set of mini buttons
[03:11:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[03:11:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure if we should support that
[03:12:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you use icons the allignment will be off too
[03:14:02] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, OK. It doesn't currently work either, mostly because mini is false by default.
[03:14:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the option mini is for the group, not for individual buttons. I think it should stay that way when we it is done with classes only
[03:14:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly
[03:15:02] <_|Nix|_> Alright. I guess we don't need a negating class then.
[03:15:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and I think you can still achive it by not adding the mini class to the group, but to the individual buttons (except the one you don't want mini)
[03:15:16] <_|Nix|_> We can add a negation class if we someone reports an issue.
[03:15:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's true.
[03:15:30] <uGoMobi> s/achive/achieve/
[03:15:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I sure as heck won't write a demo illustrating how you can get a single maxi checkbox among a group of mini checkboxes.
[03:16:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let ppl who want such oddities figure it out themselves.
[03:16:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was about to say that we shouldn't make a demo for that
[03:16:23] <uGoMobi> :)
[03:16:28] <uGoMobi> exactly
[03:16:38] <_|Nix|_> *wipe hands*
[03:17:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we never set option mini to true by default, right?
[03:17:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then we don't need the negate class

[05:29:26] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Thoughts on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10085 ?
[05:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> I think the current behavior is correct.
[05:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> If you say your grid is 40x40, then you shouldn't be able to get back to a height of 35.
[05:31:46] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: that actually returns to 35 for me in his example
[05:32:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[05:33:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: made same stupid mistake as you last night and forgot to adjust dependency names in a 1.4-cherrypick need you to give thumbs up to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7462
[05:33:17] <arschmitz> oh never mind you did already somehow didnt see or get that email
[05:33:40] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: *looking now*
[05:34:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I feel your pain.
[05:34:31] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, the current behavior seems wrong. Only 40 is adhering to the actual grid. Everything else is 40 + start.
[05:36:03] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, the current behavior is off, but not for the reason that the OP is claiming. Hard to say what's going on in that resize handler though.
[05:37:00] <tj_vantoll> Even without the resize and stop handlers the size is still 40 + start.
[05:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> I can't wait for the rewrites.
[05:37:34] <tj_vantoll> Still I don't get tickets like this. Why would you use the grid option with a resizable that doesn't start as a multiple of the grid dimensions?
[05:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I don't get it either.
[05:37:53] <tj_vantoll> I would return the ticket asking whey they're doing this.

[09:19:11] <retooth> hi everyone, i would like to write an alphabetic list widget, similar to androids contact list. is there any interest for this?
[09:21:14] <arschmitz> retooth: similar to http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/listview-autodividers-linkbar/autodividers-linkbar-demo.html ?
[09:22:11] <retooth> arschmitz: yes
[09:23:23] <arschmitz> retooth: so i guess we have that covered :)
[09:25:09] <retooth> retooth: didn't know about that, but still i feel a bit strange about adding jquery mobile to my program, since it is not meant for mobile at all :/
[09:28:47] <arschmitz> retooth: you can use just the listview make a custom download with the download builder and you did specifically say "androids contact list" so not a surprise it would be in the mobile library
[09:30:29] <retooth> arschmitz: the thing is, i need it for drag and drop, so i thought it would be good to integrate it in jquery ui, so i can combine draggable/sortable with the new widget.
[09:30:47] <arschmitz> you can do that
[09:30:55] <arschmitz> just call them on the listview
[09:31:03] <arschmitz> i have a demo of that somewhere
[09:31:21] <arschmitz> but its nothing special just call them on the listview
[09:32:45] <retooth> ok, that sounds cool. can i customize the autodivider, e.g. not displaying right chevron icons and not displaying the letter list on the right?
[09:35:44] <retooth> (@arschmitz)
[09:36:28] <arschmitz> retooth: yes
[09:38:41] <retooth> retooth: ok. but are you sure, you don't want it? i did some stuff with jquery mobile and the design workflow is a lot different than with pure jquery/jquery ui.
[09:39:06] <retooth> s/retooth/arschmitz
[09:39:55] <arschmitz> retooth: jQuery mobile and jQuery ui are merging
[09:40:26] <arschmitz> retooth: your welcome to post your widget and we will look at it though
[09:43:05] <retooth> arschmitz: didn't know they where merging? how is the design workflow planned? adding classes (like in jq mobile) or calling methods (like in jqui)?
[09:43:35] <arschmitz> retooth: not sure what you mean
[09:43:55] <arschmitz> retooth: but if your talking about the theme we are adopting a new shared theme
[09:46:08] <retooth> arschmitz: sorry, i meant attributes, not classes. jquery mobile mostly uses the data-role attribute (and other?) to define widgets afaik (so i guess it gets rendered by a global script), while jquery ui creates widgets by defining methods e.g. $("ul").sortable()
[09:47:33] <arschmitz> retooth: thats just part of the auto init which is optional
[09:48:33] <arschmitz> retooth: in mobile you can still use widgets in the same way as ui you can optionaly use autoinit which allows widgets to be initalized and options passed based on data attributes
[09:50:48] <retooth> arschmitz: ok, didn't know that. thanks. guess, i just fiddle around with the divided list of jquery mobile. maybe i find something other i can contribute at a later time :)
[09:51:33] <arschmitz> retooth: feel free to file issues and also to still post your widget if you would like us to look at it
[09:56:09] <retooth> arschmitz: if i can't customize it the way i want, i'll fork it in jquery mobile and send a pull request, but probably that's not necessary. thanks again for your help
[09:56:34] <arschmitz> retooth: no problem thanks for the offer
[09:57:15] <retooth> you're welcome
