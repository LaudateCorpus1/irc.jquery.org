[00:58:43] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15lukaseckert opened issue #7610: 1.3.2 -> 1.4.3: Disabling checkboxes not working anymore 02http://git.io/jhGBAQ
[02:39:28] <didiergm> JQM 1.4 two question 1 - How can I tell that a page has already been enhanced and 2- is enhanceWithin on a page the exact equivalent of what the auto page enhancement does ?
[02:44:44] <gabriel_schulhof> didiergm: 1. Good question. 2. Yes.
[02:45:05] <gabriel_schulhof> didiergm: You can check if the page element has data at key "mobile-page" 
[02:45:52] <didiergm> gabriel_schulhof: :)
[02:46:49] <didiergm> gabriel_schulhof if I do a enhanceWithin on a page these are the only keys I am getting from .data():  {role: "page", url: "saisieclient", closeBtn: "none"} all of which I keyedin
[02:47:13] <didiergm> $('#saisieclient').data('mobile-page') is undefined
[02:48:29] <gabriel_schulhof> didiergm: Right.
[02:48:46] <gabriel_schulhof> didiergm: If you call .enhanceWithin() on a page element it won't have the page data.
[02:49:07] <gabriel_schulhof> However, if you call .page() on a page element, then .page() calls .enhanceWithin() as part of its instantiation.
[02:49:38] <gabriel_schulhof> didiergm: So $( "#my-page" ).page() will enhance the page.
[02:49:43] <gabriel_schulhof> ... in addition to creating a page widget on it.
[02:49:55] <gabriel_schulhof> However, if you call .enhanceWithin() then that leaves no mark.
[02:50:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Still, you could check whether a certain widget on the page has data at key "mobile-widgetname"
[02:50:47] <gabriel_schulhof> So, if you have, like, a selectmenu on the page you could check whether $( "select" ).data( "mobile-selectmenu" ) == null
[02:51:03] <didiergm> gabriel_schulhof: I find myself in a situation very often to have a relatively easy (ie standard way) to tell if a page has been enhanced
[02:51:28] <didiergm> as I am not developping each of my clients site individually, but I am creating a library of utilities
[02:51:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[02:51:41] <didiergm> to autopmate data entry etc ....
[02:51:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ... You could hook up to the pagecreate event,.
[02:52:23] <gabriel_schulhof> $( "#my-page" ).on( "pagecreate", function() { /* $( this ) has just finished enhancing */ } );
[02:52:36] <didiergm> Would there be any bads side effects in calling .page() repeatedly ?
[02:52:45] <gabriel_schulhof> I don't believe so.
[02:52:50] <didiergm> e.g. every time the user returns to that page
[02:52:59] <gabriel_schulhof> didiergm: I think that happens already.
[02:53:12] <gabriel_schulhof> didiergm: ... if you're using jQM navigation.
[02:53:24] <didiergm> OK, I may try that instead of playing with the stealthy enhanceWithin :)
[02:53:26] <didiergm> thanks
[02:53:39] <didiergm> you're right
[02:54:19] <didiergm> last thing as far as you know the  key "mobile-page"  should remain for the foreseable future ?
[02:54:47] <gabriel_schulhof> didiergm: For as long as the widget factory works the way it works.
[02:54:57] <didiergm> ok, thanks
[02:55:01] <gabriel_schulhof> didiergm: NP!
[03:04:19] <didiergm> gabriel_schulhof: works like a charm - thanks again :)
[03:04:44] <gabriel_schulhof> didiergm: Np! Have fun!

[07:48:08] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz gnarf kborchers rxaviers tj_vantoll: We're going to try to release 1.11.1 tomorrow before the meeting. Let us know if there's anything you're working on that we should make sure gets in to the release.
[07:48:50] <rxaviers> I assume there's no Globalize 1.x on it right?
[07:49:01] <rxaviers> :-)
[07:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> right :-)
[07:51:07] <rxaviers> ok. I'll double check DB part...
[08:55:18] <leobalter> ping scott_gonzalez tj_vantoll
[08:56:24] <leobalter> jzaefferer asked me to ping you about a failing test I'm getting on jQuery UI. It's on datepicker autosize, using the Hebrew locale: http://minus.com/i/b20wWmwtTKxzd 
[08:58:11] <tj_vantoll> leobalter: hmmm, this is presumably on the master branch?
[08:58:18] <leobalter> it's failing on master branch too
[08:58:39] <leobalter> new cloned + npm install
[08:59:08] <leobalter> the pic was not with a clean branch, but I'm getting the same error everywhere
[08:59:20] <tj_vantoll> It works for me on Firefox and Chrome. Are you on Windows?
[08:59:31] <leobalter> Mac, Firefox and Chrome and Grunt
[09:00:18] <leobalter> I'll clone jQuery UI one more time and see again
[09:00:53] <tj_vantoll> Yeah this is odd. I'm not seeing the error and it passes in Swarm http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3374.
[09:01:41] <tj_vantoll> It's probably not worth spending too much time on, as the autoSize option is going away in the datepicker rewrite.
[09:06:13] <leobalter> good. Meanwhile the new clone is not getting fast: 2.00 KiB/s
[10:20:37] <didiergm> JQM : when populating a form from an Ajax call, What is the recommended way to force a textarea to autogrow to display it full content (or even better autosize, but I could live with a 'too big' field)
[10:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> didiergm: Support is in #jquery

[10:59:26] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1305
[10:59:45] <mikesherov_> would love a set of eyes on this if you have a moment
[11:01:00] <scott_gonzalez> Looking now
[11:05:21] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: kept the parseInt because I wanted to follow what was already there
[11:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> Seems reasonable.
[11:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> this.outerDimensions never gets reset?
[11:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like borderDif never did either.
[11:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that's correct, but it's certainly in line with what was happening before.
[11:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> Seems good to land.
[11:09:47] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: yeah, looked like a bug to me
[11:09:57] <mikesherov_> maybe I should leave a comment there
[11:10:11] <mikesherov_> but don't want to change the semantics during a refactor of something else
[11:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's fine.
