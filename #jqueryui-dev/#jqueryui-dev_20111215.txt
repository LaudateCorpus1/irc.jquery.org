[07:44:31] <plaes> heya!
[07:45:15] <plaes> could you please show the theme icons on following page: http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/API
[07:45:28] <plaes> I'm going crazy trying to find them :S
[08:19:25] <ravager> tab select (before activation) can NOT be cancelled to prevent the tab from activating .. demo: created an "add tab" tab, which isn't intended to be an actual tab ..  http://jsfiddle.net/V49a9/1/ works, clicking the tab brings up a dialog and does not select the false tab.  http://jsfiddle.net/hJNmv/1/ does NOT work, the false tab is selected.
[08:20:07] <ravager> NOTE: The complaint is in regards to jQuery UI 1.9 .. 1.8.x works .. so just pointing out a possible issue.
[10:00:32] <kborchers> anyone have issues with this before i merge it with master? https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/89c078c6db44a702744becac410b6e9b0b9c64b3

[12:21:04] <hdon> hi all :)
[12:21:51] <hdon> so i've been using jquery mobile, and learning a lot about jquery ui by reading through the source code
[12:22:15] <hdon> jquery mobile fires an "init" event for many of its widgets. is that a standard jquery ui pattern?
[12:23:05] <hdon> "init" is analogous to $(document).ready(), unlike "create" which occurs before the DOM is mucked with
[12:34:54] <gnarf> hdon: nope, thats a jqm pattern
[12:35:09] <hdon> gnarf: ah, ok. thanks
[12:37:10] <hdon> the reason i ask is because we have an asynchronous JS loader for our code, but that produces a race condition between jquery mobile's "init" and our code which binds to the "init" event. this is unlike $(document).ready() which honors handlers installed after domready has already fired
