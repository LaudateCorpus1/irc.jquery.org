[06:04:44] <arschmitz> gabriels1hulhof: Ping!
[11:22:39] <nafur> Hey guys. I have a potential bug in jqueryui. I was trying to file a bug, but get rejected with the message "Submission rejected as potential spam (Maximum number of posts per hour for this IP (127.0.0.1) exceeded)"
[11:23:24] <nafur> (I tried to create a ticket at bugs.jqueryui.com)
[11:26:06] <nafur> If I use firefox (instead of chrome), the message is "Submission rejected as potential spam  (Akismet says content is spam,  Maximum number of posts per hour for this IP (127.0.0.1) exceeded)"

[11:36:48] <rxaviers> those last two comments seem sane to me
[11:36:51] <rxaviers> you'll most likely want to provide a nice entry point like that
[11:36:55] <rxaviers> and it will just work
[11:37:14] <rxaviers> Do you want me to intro him to you, so you can follow-up the discussion?
[11:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[11:39:22] <scott_gonzalez> nafur: As annoying as this is, can you just try again in a little bit? We've been having lots of issues; we're working on fixing the bug tracker.
[11:39:22] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, are you in gitter too?
[11:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:39:43] <nafur> scott_gonzalez: ok, will do in a couple of minutes...
[11:39:51] <scott_gonzalez> What's the bug?
[11:50:18] <nafur> scott_gonzalez: basically, draggable does not work on iOS 5.1.1
[11:50:57] <nafur> this demo (http://cipher-code.de/conceptmap/tests/draggable.html) does work on chrome 43 and firefox 38 (or 34?), but not on iOS 5.1.1. no js errors, just does not move...
[11:56:29] <scott_gonzalez> That's expected.
[11:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> nafur: Use http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[12:01:26] <nafur> scott_gonzalez: hm, okay. thanks. Now my demo works on the iPad, but my original problem is still there...
