[05:56:05] <scott_gonzalez> who's around?
[05:56:10] <arschmitz> i am
[05:56:16] <arschmitz> big suprise lol
[05:56:19] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[05:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a few things to discuss for the AMD test updates.
[05:56:50] <arschmitz> ok
[05:57:00] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz pushed 1 new commit to 061.5-test-cleanup: 02http://git.io/veaoD
[05:57:00] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/061.5-test-cleanup 14fde6065 15Alexander Schmitz: Build: Add jscs right now its scope is limited to new code and build
[05:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> First, I'd like to rename all the .js files.
[05:57:19] <arschmitz> to?
[05:57:25] <scott_gonzalez> Looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/tests/unit/accordion
[05:57:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to just drop the widget prefixes.
[05:57:40] <arschmitz> makes sense
[05:57:42] <scott_gonzalez> So accordion_core.js -> core.js
[05:57:48] <arschmitz> we basicly did that everywhere else 
[05:57:53] <arschmitz> by droping jquery
[05:57:57] <scott_gonzalez> And rename accordion_test_helpers.js -> helper.js
[05:58:16] <arschmitz> its the same concept the folder clearly indicates its accordion so its redundant 
[05:58:20] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:58:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so that's the first thing.
[05:58:34] <arschmitz> ok +1 for that
[05:58:38] <scott_gonzalez> The next thing is making the individual helpers extend the main helper.
[05:59:03] <arschmitz> if we want to modularize and share with mobile that makes sense
[05:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> This new file: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui/commit/46c030a89e9d8ce3e1eedbb457a8ec7dabc38a36#diff-376a14c31425d4b4dff8c9d3587a8c96
[05:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> So accordion/helper would look like:
[05:59:42] <scott_gonzalez> define( [ "lib/helper" ], function( helper ) {
[05:59:46] <scott_gonzalez> helper.whatev = ...;
[05:59:47] <scott_gonzalez> return helper;
[06:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> Then when we need helpers we just load the base helper or the widget helper.
[06:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> We never need to load both.
[06:00:31] <arschmitz> makes sense
[06:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> I noticed we even have a case of this partially happening already: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/datepicker/datepicker_test_helpers.js#L25
[06:01:06] <arschmitz> yup
[06:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> And of course because they were part of the same object, just namespaced.
[06:01:13] <scott_gonzalez> s/because/before/
[06:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so the last thing is just getting a review of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1532
[06:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to rebase on top of that so I can update the all.html files.
[06:02:08] <scott_gonzalez> They're broken since we updated QUnit.
[06:02:08] <arschmitz> ok
[06:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> Because we were using some internals.
[06:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> It's a very straight-forward change.
[06:03:05] <arschmitz> ok that looks good
[06:03:11] <scott_gonzalez> thanks

[06:05:57] <arschmitz> oh execpt i reset to origin and you already pushed

[06:07:59] <arschmitz> and it passes the normal draggable tests just not in the composite
[06:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, good.

[06:13:27] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Now that I've landed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8051, I was going to rebase 1.5-dev onto it so I can then proceed to make the boilerplate update ready, but since you're working on the tests I'm inclined to hold off on that. What say you?
[06:14:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Also, hey!
[06:21:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: my stuff is ready give it a look over and i can land it

[06:45:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I need to close the textinput classes PR and re-open against 1.5-dev, right?
[06:45:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I took a look at the PR.
[06:46:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I just address those final two issues and realized the PR was still against ui-1-12.
[06:47:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: just cherry pick the commits
[06:47:22] <arschmitz> or rebase it what ever is easier for you
[06:47:44] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but I need to close the PR and open a new one, because GH won't let you re-address your PR to a different upstream branch.
[06:48:40] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:48:45] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Will do.
[06:51:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so i may have to disable the whole sequence test suite
[06:51:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i disabled broken ones it ran all green for one run pushed again an a different sequence test failed

[07:02:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, OK. I mean, it'll run locally anyway.
[07:02:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It's weird that it's so much stabler locally.
[07:02:53] <arschmitz> yeah and all of a sudden
[07:03:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ...
[07:03:00] <arschmitz> started with git and now every version
[07:03:35] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The fact is this should go away when we switch to testing on a wider variety of browsers.
[07:05:03] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:05:52] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: did you see i changed most of our grunt alias
[07:05:52] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, the fact that the browser itself throws an error ... that's like our test suite causing FF to crash.
[07:06:07] <arschmitz> to either build:xxx or test:xxx
[07:06:07] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, damn nigh-on unheard-of.
[07:06:32] <arschmitz> yeah im clueless
[07:06:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I noticed, and you factored out the aliasing code into a module, which is also nice.
[07:06:56] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm beginning to feel like phantomjs has had its run.
[07:07:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i tried to switch spider.js to slimerjs last night
[07:07:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: which is headless gecko but it wont work on OSX any more and it does not sound like there is hope for a fix any time soon
[07:08:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, fer cryin' out-loud ... I suppose BS can rejoyce ...
[07:13:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: osx you run it and it just exits 
[07:13:20] <arschmitz> no message no code you hit enter on the command line and it just does nothing but make a new line lol
[07:13:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Bah! Useless.

[07:25:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It still doesn't produce custom CSS when you do a custom build like master does. Is this because it's not yet up-to-speed wrt. master?
[07:25:39] <arschmitz> it should i didnt remove anything im aware of
[07:25:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ...
[07:25:55] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll have a look. I added the custom CSS stuff.
[07:25:58] <arschmitz> i may have broken something though lol
[07:26:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: modules.js was hooking into stuff that may no longer be there.
[07:28:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It sets some config options (like requirejs.js.options.onBuildWrite and requirejs.js.options.onModuleBundleComplete)
[07:28:15] <arschmitz> that should still work
[07:28:24] <arschmitz> very little changed in the actual tasks
[07:28:39] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Then I'll have a look at why it's not working.
[07:29:47] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that would be great id like to land this so we can have green tests again
[07:30:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ummm ... where's the requirejs configuration?
[07:31:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.5-test-cleanup/build/tasks/options/requirejs.js
[07:31:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Aaaah, options. OK.
[07:31:50] <gabriel_schulhof> So, maybe that's getting loaded after modules.js, overwriting the hooks left in place by modules.js
[07:31:58] <gabriel_schulhof> We need a dependency structure for our modules :)

[07:32:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no tasks run when they run
[07:32:27] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Right, but modules.js modifies the grunt configuration.
[07:32:29] <arschmitz> you specify their order. 
[07:32:34] <arschmitz> yes

[07:34:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ummm ... I moved makeModulesList from the gruntfile to modules.
[07:34:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Now we have two: One in build/tasks/options/requirejs.js and one in build/tasks/modules
[07:34:55] <arschmitz> oops ill fix that
[07:35:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: requirejs.js should not be calculating any modules stuff. It should just declare its configuration /before/ the modules task runs.

[08:20:46] <arschmitz> im not going to worry about that
[08:20:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Holy shitsu! ... and I got a million errors from jscs now.
[08:21:06] <arschmitz> lol did you just grunt jscs?
[08:21:14] <gabriel_schulhof> No, just grunt --modules=widgets/popup
[08:21:30] <gabriel_schulhof> But jscs:build is part of that task.
[08:21:58] <arschmitz> yeah thats passing on travs and for me
[08:22:37] <arschmitz> are you on the right sha?

[08:23:00] <arschmitz> nope
[08:23:30] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, then I think you need to push the rest.
[08:23:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no thats not the commit on github
[08:24:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, you must've rebased then ...
[08:24:31] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, I just did a git remote update origin, and I have everything from the main repo.
[08:24:43] <arschmitz> ok
[08:24:59] <gabriel_schulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/1.5-test-cleanup
[08:25:03] <arschmitz> yup
[08:25:10] <arschmitz> thats green on travis
[08:25:17] <gabriel_schulhof> It shows 1c7fd5e as the top.
[08:25:25] <arschmitz> oh shit i read your sha wrong yeah your on right one
[08:25:32] <arschmitz> and that passes on travis and locally
[08:26:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Not if you run grunt with no arguments.
[08:26:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That task will fail with jscs errors, because we're not up to the new style guide.
[08:26:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: But I suppose that's beyond the scope of this PR.
[08:26:51] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no it passes
[08:27:01] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh!
[08:27:02] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[08:27:04] <arschmitz> because its only running against files that are updated
[08:27:20] <arschmitz> i have no idea why you would get errors
[08:27:23] <gabriel_schulhof> It's because I have some js files in my root, like stacktrace.js and stuff. Those are the failing ones.
[08:27:36] <arschmitz> gotcha
[08:27:51] <arschmitz> because it for sure passes
[08:27:51] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so it scans the repo root for files too?
[08:27:58] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:28:12] <arschmitz> didnt see any reason not to
[08:28:27] <gabriel_schulhof> I have so much debris in there it's not even funny. When I type git status, I need to type git status | less because I have so manu untracked files from the repo root :)
[08:28:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Does it scan all subdirs except node_modules?
[08:28:52] <arschmitz> why dont you make a folder and put it all in there and ignore it?
[08:29:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, that's what I was planning, but will jscs ignore it?
[08:29:16] <arschmitz> yes
[08:29:18] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Good.
[08:29:23] <arschmitz> it just does root tests build and js
[08:29:39] <arschmitz> but most of that does not run by default
[08:29:59] <arschmitz> just new files in 1.5 and build
[08:31:00] <arschmitz> i should really add htmllint and csslint and maybe even csscomb while im at it
[08:31:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so originally i was only going to run the static analysis stuff on every run on travis to speed it up and just do it as part of the build run
[08:31:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but i was thinking they run pretty fast and work as a good fail fast 
[08:32:12] <arschmitz> to skip the unit tests if it fails jshint or jscs
[08:32:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, definitely.
[08:33:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: did you see how i made the ci magic work?
[08:33:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I saw. Nice!
[08:33:29] <arschmitz> very simple
[08:33:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice and clean.
[08:34:11] <arschmitz> i was less then happy to see that the exclude paterns for --suites never worked though
[08:34:23] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, if this is all green then I think it's good to go.
[08:34:38] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: cool ill rebase and land on 1.5-dev
[08:34:54] <arschmitz> this should help going forward to have faster tests that actually pass
[08:35:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, and I'll have to rebase 1.5-dev on top of master again to have the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8045 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8056.
[08:35:28] <gabriel_schulhof> ... so I can then put the boilerplate on top of that.
[08:35:31] <arschmitz> i can do it at the same time if you want
[08:35:39] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. That'd be awesome.
[08:35:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah im waiting for that to do esformatter
[08:36:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Sometimes it feels like 1.5 will bear no resemblance to 1.4.
[08:37:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: there isnt even that much divergence yet
[08:37:33] <arschmitz> aside from new buttons
[08:38:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, we'll have a bunch of new widgets, so there'll be that.

[12:37:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Nevermind, I figured it out. I was having trouble with qunit-composite + AMD.
[12:37:24] <scott_gonzalez> But I found a solution that seems like it should always work.
[12:37:30] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: best outcome
[13:13:09] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: What's up?
[14:12:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, I must've been second-hand-smoking something when I wrote https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.5-dev/js/widgets/widget.backcompat.js#L19-L32 ... splice works just fine.
[14:13:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll get rid of that.
