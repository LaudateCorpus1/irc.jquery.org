[13:13:53] <sabotage> scott_gonzalez: thanks for the reply on #560
[13:14:33] <sabotage> I guess for now we'll maintain a fork of 1.8.* with our changes to prepareOffsets() and _drop()
[13:15:48] <scott_gonzalez> I feel kind of bad that interactions don't (and really can't) get much attention right now
[13:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> Theoretically 2.0 should take considerably less time than 1.9
[13:19:47] <sabotage> that'd be nice ;)
[13:20:41] <sabotage> out of curiosity, do you expect 2.0/interactions to account for the use case we're dealing with?
[13:21:09] <sabotage> i.e. dragging from top into iframe owned droppable?
[13:22:07] <sabotage> in our case at least, the iframe contentDocument is dynamically created, so xss is not an issue
[14:18:54] <rworth> sabotage: my best guess is they wouldn't account for it out-of-the box, but built in such a way that you could work with/around it, instead of having to hack
[18:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> sabotage: We're willing to organize the code such that it's easy to extend, rather than hack. So when we get closer to 2.0, if there's a change that would make it easier for you to build a clean extension, just let us know.
