[00:31:36] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery UI Release Coverage build #26: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20Release%20Coverage/26/
[00:31:36] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Build: Add a newline at the end of manifest files.
[00:31:37] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Use tabs for package.json.
[00:31:37] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Updated AUTHORS.txt.
[00:31:38] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Build: New release script.
[05:32:26] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: That could work.
[05:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> Pages will be flat, so abusing the heirarchy is fine.
[05:33:16] <scott_gonzalez> And we're only going to have direct links to them, they won't be searched against or anything.
[08:30:45] <kswedberg> .
[10:41:59] <agcolom> hi! am I ok to change grunt-jquery-content to 0.3.1 on api.jquerymobile.com?
[10:44:08] <ajpiano> agcolom: yes,
[10:44:30] <ajpiano> but like i said you probably will want to just leave it as 0.3.x in your package.json
[10:44:40] <ajpiano> this way you don't have to modify package.json again when 0.3.2 comes out, etc
[10:46:26] <agcolom> ajpiano: oh good to know! Thanks!
[10:47:08] <agcolom> so if I change it to 0.3.x then I still need to do npm install when a new one comes out?
[10:47:56] <ajpiano> yes
[10:48:05] <ajpiano> but you won't have to physically modify package.json
[10:48:26] <agcolom> yes, ok, Fantastic! Thanks and have a great weekend ;-)
[10:48:58] <ajpiano> you too agcolom, hope you like those htmls now
[10:49:23] <agcolom> thanks! will try now...
[10:52:09] <agcolom> ajpiano: strange... I did npm install but nothing happened :(
[10:52:38] <agcolom> should I try with 0.3.2?
[10:52:42] <ajpiano> odd
[10:52:46] <ajpiano> no, there is no 0.3.2
[10:52:57] <agcolom> sorry, i mean 0.3.1
[10:53:04] <ajpiano> sure
[10:53:08] <agcolom> ok...
[10:53:33] <agcolom> with 0.3.1, npm install get 0.3.1
[10:53:55] <gnarf> I think ~0.3.1 does the same ajpiano
[10:54:00] <ajpiano> hm, .x might not actually do what i think
[10:54:09] <agcolom> ok :-)
[10:54:10] <ajpiano> agcolom: technically you can also put "latest" there ;)
[10:54:33] <gnarf> I think "~0.3.2" is what you want agcolom that means it will take any version >= 0.3.2 but < 0.4
[10:54:58] <gnarf> assuming that point releases will never break current functionality, it seems safest
[10:55:15] <gnarf> or sorry ~0.3.1
[10:55:18] <agcolom> the highlighting is much better! Thanks !!!
[10:55:44] <agcolom> gnarf: so you recommend to use ~0.3.1?
[10:56:35] <agcolom> the fonts are very nice too!
[10:57:20] <gnarf> agcolom: That or just "0.3.1" :)  I am not sure which makes more sense in a node world, but ~0.3.1 seems sane
[10:57:33] <agcolom> I am in love with the 'a' in this font!
[10:58:00] <ajpiano>  looks kind of weird small :(
[10:58:13] <agcolom> does it?
[10:58:20] <ajpiano> on windows
[10:58:24] <ajpiano> looks great on mac
[10:58:39] <gnarf> um
[10:58:42] <gnarf> btw
[10:58:47] <gnarf> is this gonna cause us problems
[10:58:47] <gnarf> http://jquerymobile.com/resources
[10:58:53] <agcolom> yes, I'm on a mac!
[10:59:21] <ajpiano> agcolom: i'm on both!
[10:59:26] <gnarf> isn't /resources mapped to the uploaded content from grunt wordpress deploy?
[10:59:39] <agcolom> with is the problem with resources?
[10:59:50] <gnarf> and mobile uses it as a page name it seems
[11:00:25] <agcolom> Todd is porting that page to the new site I think...
[11:01:20] <agcolom> gnarf: I'm with you now!
[11:01:44] <agcolom> let me check on the new site....
[11:02:15] <agcolom> gnarf: yes, it's http://stage.jquerymobile.com/resources/
[11:02:36] <agcolom> so this will conflict with /resources api docs.
[11:02:43] <agcolom> ?
[11:02:51] <gnarf> im not sure
[11:03:21] <agcolom> but won't they be on 2 different 'domains'
[11:03:23] <agcolom> ?
[11:03:33] <gnarf> yes they will, but if jquerymobile.com ever has a "resource"
[11:03:45] <gnarf> that needs to be pushed (i.e. a big photo or something)
[11:03:56] <agcolom> yes...
[11:04:56] <gnarf> im not sure if /resources/ is needed for the rewrite for that url
[11:04:56] <agcolom> should we think about renaming the resources page (currently resources/ to resources.html?)
[11:05:25] <agcolom> no idea...
[11:05:38] <gnarf> rworth / scott_gonzalez: ^^^ is this an issue or is it just something that popped into my head that is irrelevant
[11:09:28] <gnarf> agcolom: keep it as a "possible conflict" in mind - hopefully scott_gonzalez or rworth can give us more info
[11:09:38] <agcolom> sure, ok.
[11:09:51] <agcolom> thanks!
[11:16:28] <agcolom> sorry! just discovered a bug!
[11:16:47] <agcolom> if you go to http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/checkbox/ and go to the bottom of the page.
[11:17:03] <agcolom> the line numbers say NAN!
[11:20:52] <agcolom> gnarf: ^ any idea what is causing this?
[11:21:09] <gnarf> agcolom: nope
[11:21:16] <gnarf> lemme hook that up
[11:22:05] <gnarf> hrm
[11:22:10] <gnarf> ajpiano: any thoughts ^ ?
[11:22:30] <ajpiano> hmm
[11:22:40] <agcolom> could it be 0.3.1?
[11:22:46] <ajpiano> let me look, i just did a thing with line numbers in post-0.3.1
[11:22:49] <ajpiano> but it's not in 03.1
[11:23:24] <ajpiano> gnarf: can you give me the hosts entry for stage.api.jquerymobile.com
[11:23:28] <ajpiano> or is the same as stage for everything else
[11:23:34] <agcolom> same I think
[11:24:13] <gnarf> same
[11:24:22] <gnarf> I really need to set these up in DNS soon
[11:24:48] <agcolom> are you all in Boston?
[11:25:17] <ajpiano> no, he's in ilinois and i'm in nyc
[11:25:30] <agcolom> nice!
[11:25:54] <agcolom> I went to Chicago once 14year ago!!!! Loved it!
[11:26:37] <agcolom> never been to NYC, but plan to one day! definitely!
[11:30:36] <ajpiano> it's the best!
[11:30:38] <ajpiano> where are you agcolom
[11:37:34] <agcolom> ajpiano: London, UK. But I am French!
[11:38:50] <agcolom> Will catch you later... have to pick up my daughter who is coming back from a school trip! (they went surfing/kayaking/abseiling/climbing/etc... for a week in Devon! lucky them!)
[11:39:33] <ajpiano> a demain!!
[11:39:52] <agcolom> a demain ;)
[12:15:57] <rworth> agcolom gnarf this issue was fixed in the past by nacin
[12:16:14] <rworth> I can't remember if it was a nginx rewrite that hasn't made it to .htaccess but that would be my guess
[12:16:17] <rworth> I've seen it work
[12:16:24] <nacin> hello
[12:16:30] <nacin> reading scrollback
[12:16:57] <rworth> nacin jquerymobile.com/resources (page) vs jquerymobile.com/resources/* files
[12:17:04] <gnarf> it might already be in there
[12:17:24] <gnarf> and i just don't know about it, i just saw the conflict and thought to bring it up :)
[12:18:20] <nacin> agcolom: if you open up your .htaccess file
[12:18:29] <nacin> look for the ^resources/(.*) rule
[12:18:33] <nacin> change the .* to a .+
[12:18:44] <nacin> actually, that won't work
[12:18:53] <nacin> adding something now to the web-base-template readme
[12:19:38] <nacin> RewriteRule ^resources/?$ index.php [L]
[12:24:52] <nacin> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/3d0332db38f5490f130934d1292cb420683afbb4
[12:24:53] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on web-base-template by Andrew Nacin (23.258s ago): Allow a /resources/ page to hit WordPress, rather than the gw-resources directory listing. Syncs up a rule already in the nginx config on staging and production.
[13:21:47] <gnarf> rworth scott_gonzalez: are you guys around for much longer today?
[13:21:53] <gnarf> I'm gonna start moving ui web stuff
[13:43:07] <gnarf> ajpiano: are you gonna be around much longer?
[13:43:42] <ajpiano> should be here on and off for a few more hours i think but will have company soon
[13:44:41] <gnarf> ajpiano: okay, im starting to move plugins
[13:44:43] <gnarf> wish me luck
[13:44:43] <gnarf> :)
[13:44:50] <ajpiano> GLWTD
[13:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom gnarf: A page/post named resources should be fine (depending on the rewrite rule), but nested pages under resources would conflict.
[13:49:19] <scott_gonzalez> You should probably avoid having a post with the name "resources" though.
[13:49:49] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can move /resources/ to /_resources/
[13:50:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'd be ok with that. We'd need to update all the existing sites, but that's better than breaking an existing URL for jquerymobile.com
[13:51:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i just pinged you on an infra issue re: blog.jqueryui.com
[13:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let me catch up on the flood of emails from when I was on the plane.
[13:56:07] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG node 0.9.0
[13:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> That was fast.
[13:59:23] <gnarf> ajpiano: hrm
[13:59:33] <gnarf> ajpiano: this redirect is confusing me
[14:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: blog.jqueryui.com looks good to me.
[14:01:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cool, ill flip it over in a minute
[14:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Should I have been pointing my /etc/hosts somewhere?
[14:02:26] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yes
[14:02:27] <gnarf> :)
[14:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[14:02:36] <ajpiano> gnarf: what redirect? redirects rae not "in my wheelhouse"
[14:02:49] <ajpiano> are*
[14:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What's the new IP?
[14:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> 216.70.85.60?
[14:14:41] <gnarf> sounds right
[14:14:44] <gnarf> eol2.jquery.com
[14:14:49] <gnarf> there is a hosts entry in the issue
[14:17:08] <gnarf> um
[14:17:20] <gnarf> so the current archive.plugins.jquery.com seems pretty worthless
[14:17:21] <gnarf> :)
[14:17:47] <gnarf> ajpiano: what is like a url i can use to test this thing
[14:17:55] <gnarf> i've been thinging its messed up cuz i keep getting the error
[14:18:18] <ajpiano> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/ajaxFileUpload
[14:18:22] <ajpiano> ostensibly would work
[14:18:22] <gnarf> the "Site Offline" drupal error
[14:18:45] <gnarf> i get an offline error
[14:18:53] <gnarf> on the current live as well i think
[14:20:08] <ajpiano> yeah, that's happened a bunch of tiems recently
[14:20:17] <ajpiano> i think it's cause mysql isn't running
[14:20:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: seems to be working with updated /etc/hosts
[14:20:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cool
[14:21:02] <gnarf> ajpiano: mysql is definitely running
[14:21:11] <gnarf> trying to do a repair tables on it tho
[14:21:15] <gnarf> some of them are "corrupt"
[14:21:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: flipping those over then
[14:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[14:22:01] <agcolom> Hi, I'm back!
[14:24:25] <fnagel> hey scott
[14:24:35] <agcolom> any news on the nan issue?
[14:24:54] <ajpiano> agcolom: i figured it out, there's a pull request
[14:25:04] <agcolom> cool! thanks!
[14:25:07] <ajpiano> will be in 0.3.2 ;)
[14:25:14] <agcolom> excellent ;-)
[14:25:30] <agcolom> I'm getting good at update package.json!
[14:25:37] <agcolom> updating! ^
[14:25:45] <gnarf> ajpiano: im pretty lost on this one
[14:26:01] <gnarf> cant figure out exactly what this drupal error means
[14:26:49] <ajpiano> what's the error
[14:27:59] <gnarf> "Site Offline"
[14:28:04] <gnarf> same one you see i suppose
[14:29:31] <gnarf> ooo wait
[14:29:33] <gnarf> i think i got it
[14:29:37] <gnarf> does it seem to work now?
[14:30:32] <gnarf> it might be slow
[14:30:37] <gnarf> cuz i'm stealing its dataz
[14:31:40] <ajpiano> yes
[14:31:41] <ajpiano> !
[14:45:35] <gnarf> okay
[14:45:42] <gnarf> ajpiano: i think i have archives up and running on the new host
[14:45:54] <gnarf> im just gonna swap it over
[14:45:59] <gnarf> in like an hour - check it :)
[14:46:56] <ajpiano> gnarf: awesome
[15:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Why am I not surprised? https://gist.github.com/af99cd09fcf1c127bf5e
[15:16:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: on which?
[15:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> UI clip effect
[15:17:05] <gnarf> there were a few known issues in that commit that were further fixed
[15:17:20] <scott_gonzalez> It's still broken with jquery-git though.
[15:17:50] <gnarf> do you know the nature of the break yet?
[15:18:09] <gnarf> cuz i'd like to land a fix before an rc of core
[15:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> Not yet, gonna try to reduce it right now.
[15:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't have any luck this morning when I was waiting for my plane. The clip effect is fairly simple.
[15:19:23] <gnarf> cool, I probably have a little time today to dig into it too
[15:21:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: is this a unit fail?
[15:22:06] <scott_gonzalez> no
[15:22:07] <gnarf> or what is your test for it look like now
[15:22:24] <gnarf> cuz it seems alright on /tests/visual/effects/all.html
[15:22:42] <scott_gonzalez>  /demos/effect/default.html
[15:24:06] <gnarf> hrm
[15:24:11] <gnarf> its not setting a hidden somewhere
[15:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's broken on the visual test too.
[15:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> You just can't tell.
[15:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> $( "body" ).css( "background", "#fff" );
[15:24:27] <scott_gonzalez> On the visual test.
[15:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> There are multiple effects that are broken.
[15:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> I wasn't going to test all of them yet though.
[15:26:40] <scott_gonzalez> I figure once the underlying problem is fixed, then I'll continue testing.
[15:26:55] <scott_gonzalez> But if you look at the drop effect, you'll notice that it doesn't drop.
[15:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> And slide doesn't slide.
[15:27:12] <scott_gonzalez> etc.
[15:29:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: clip seems based on width/height animations used to set overflow:hidden automatically
[15:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't happen anymore?
[15:31:17] <gnarf> it should
[15:31:37] <gnarf> line 271
[15:31:40] <gnarf> effects.js
[15:33:12] <gnarf> oh shit
[15:33:16] <gnarf> found it
[15:33:31] <gnarf> props.height || props.width is false when both are 0
[15:33:38] <gnarf> should be "height" in props || "width" in props
[15:34:08] <scott_gonzalez> FIX THAT SHIT

[15:35:49] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12117
[15:37:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna bump that up to blocker.

[15:51:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: blind seems that right/down are broken
