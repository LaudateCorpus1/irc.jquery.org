[10:43:51] <Connor> Hello.  We're upgrading jquery and jquery-ui (1.8.16 to 1.11) and having some issues with the dialogs under modal.  
[10:44:11] <Connor> The dialogs are under the overlay for some reason..
[10:47:11] <Connor> and I'm not using appendTo either.
[10:49:54] <arschmitz> Connor: Support is in #jquery this channel is for development of the libraries not with them
[12:05:49] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez arschmitz: some UI tests are taking forever to timeout: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/576. This drains the available pool of IEs
[12:06:52] <arschmitz> yeah that was started 12 hours ago thats kinda long
[12:06:55] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: ^^
[12:09:15] <m_gol> it's weird that it doesn't timeout earlier
[12:09:31] <m_gol> I'm waiting for Core tests to finish and they're waiting for those IEs http://swarm.jquery.org/job/552
[12:11:45] <arschmitz> m_gol: also weird because im trying right now and those tests are passing fine
[12:12:07] <m_gol> hmm
[12:12:54] <m_gol> arschmitz: on IE8, 9 or 11?
[12:13:57] <arschmitz> and it appears to be in every version of ie but specific to core 1.10.1
[12:14:05] <arschmitz> mgiv tried 10 and 11 so far 
[12:14:10] <arschmitz> m_gol: 
[12:15:25] <m_gol> arschmitz: the previous run on 1.10.1 failed in the same way: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/561
[12:15:34] <m_gol> and it still seems restarting
[12:15:48] <m_gol> sorry, this was 1.10.0, still similar
[12:16:12] <arschmitz> m_gol: yeah i saw that too but iv tried ok iv tried 8,9,10 and 11 with core 1.10.0 and 1.10.1 on browser stack
[12:16:27] <m_gol> ah, no, 1.10.1. it passes on 1.10.0 & 1.10.2
[12:16:28] <arschmitz> and everything passes fine on both current master and a previous commit before i fetched
[12:16:48] <arschmitz> i cant cause a timeout 
[12:16:58] <m_gol> haha, jQuery UI has 6666 commits now
[12:17:18] <arschmitz> m_gol: ha ha awesome
[12:17:34] <arschmitz> too bad i need to land a pr i have with 21 commits going to mess it up
[12:18:14] <arschmitz> m_gol: so i dont really know why those are timing out or why the timeouts are so long
[12:19:33] <arschmitz> m_gol: and its not like its a specific suite
[12:19:38] <arschmitz> its anything using 1.10.1
[12:20:06] <m_gol> arschmitz: could it be because of http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13980?
[12:20:11] <m_gol> fixed in 1.10.2
[12:20:25] <m_gol> I'm quite surprised UI doesn't just test on latest patch releases for each line
[12:20:50] <m_gol> since TestSwarm heavily uses iframes...
[12:21:07] <arschmitz> m_gol: we should have seen this before if it was that i would think
[12:21:32] <arschmitz> also that bug says ie10 and this is in 8 and 9 as well
[12:21:55] <m_gol> arschmitz: unless you added sth recently that started triggering this code path
[12:22:46] <arschmitz> m_gol: we are not failing in opera and we are failing in ie8 and 9 though and that bug says 10 ( maybe 11 too who knows )
[12:24:13] <arschmitz> m_gol: also if it throws an error qunit should catch that and fail
[12:24:15] <arschmitz> not just time out
[12:28:21] <m_gol> arschmitz: well, not many things changed from 1.10.1 to 1.10.2. http://blog.jquery.com/2013/07/03/jquery-1-10-2-and-2-0-3-released/
[12:28:31] <m_gol> the rest seems unrelated
[12:28:53] <arschmitz> m_gol: yeah i just checked the commit and that specificly did not effect ie8 so it cant be that
[12:29:41] <arschmitz> m_gol: fairly certain do dont do any cross domain content loading either 
[12:30:38] <m_gol> arschmitz: I'd try to join the swarm via IE11 (do you have the run token?) and see what happens in the console. the problem appears in IE11 as well so it might be a little easier to debug than in earlier versions
[12:31:09] <arschmitz> m_gol: i dont think i have a run token or if i do iv long since lost it lol
[12:31:51] <m_gol> arschmitz: PM'd it to you
[12:32:18] <arschmitz> i got it thank you
[12:32:43] <arschmitz> m_gol: i do actually see another commit in there that could be it though
[12:32:47] <m_gol> :)
[12:33:03] <arschmitz> m_gol: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/ad98cb167350b8d929b71bfeefc904c8964893dd#diff-e68a84fbdd2b905aed42c5ffd3f7fbfdR22
[12:33:03] <arschmitz> and
[12:33:11] <arschmitz> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14047
[12:33:16] <m_gol> in that case I think you may consider 1.10.1 broken & skip testing on it
[12:35:06] <arschmitz> m_gol: nice the console is blank
[12:35:11] <m_gol> haha
[12:35:13] <arschmitz> its not spitting out anything
[12:35:24] <m_gol> in IE11?
[12:35:50] <arschmitz> oh never mind i got it to throw an error
[12:36:39] <arschmitz> m_gol: its timeing out loading a test helper in require,js
[12:38:04] <arschmitz> ok this is weird reloaded and getting completely different errors
[12:38:19] <arschmitz> first none then timeout loading a module
[12:38:35] <arschmitz> not it is something with the iframe frameElement commit you pointed too
[12:38:38] <arschmitz> im very confused
[12:43:26] <arschmitz> it also seems it just started with commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/ad98cb167350b8d929b71bfeefc904c8964893dd which does nothing to triggger anything cross domain or do anything different related to that ( despite seeing that in one of my errors )
[12:48:55] <m_gol> arschmitz: well, testswarm is cross-domain
[12:49:46] <m_gol> arschmitz: the main page is swarm.jquery.org, the frame is on builds.jenkins.jquery.com
[12:50:20] <m_gol> the bad thing is it doesn't just fail but block everyone else from spawning IE :/
[12:50:25] <arschmitz> m_gol: oh yeah right ( im not a test swarm expert at all i forget these things lol )
[12:50:45] <m_gol> or at least stalls
[12:50:59] <arschmitz> m_gol: yeah i still dont see where that commit changes anything relevant
[12:51:14] <arschmitz> m_gol: we are passing prior to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/ad98cb167350b8d929b71bfeefc904c8964893dd
[12:52:58] <m_gol> not sure why
[12:56:40] <m_gol> arschmitz: no, it fails further into the past
[12:57:01] <m_gol> unless that's for different reasons: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/275
[12:57:37] <m_gol> but seriously, it all looks iframe-related, I'd just dump 1.10.1 from UI testing
[13:10:07] <arschmitz> m_gol: sorry your right im an idiot its failing way before that
[13:10:28] <arschmitz> im looking back now but yeah i think your right
[13:10:54] <arschmitz> this does not look new and is all due to that commit you originally pointed too as far as i can see
[13:12:23] <arschmitz> m_gol: ill talk to scott_gonzalez and jzaefferer about it
[13:14:47] <arschmitz> m_gol: im submitting a pr for it right now
[13:15:02] <m_gol> arschmitz: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12745
[13:15:09] <arschmitz> m_gol: i saw thank you
[13:15:13] <m_gol> np
[13:19:41] <arschmitz> m_gol: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1559
[13:19:44] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15arschmitz opened pull request #1559: Build: Stop testing against core 1.10.1 (06master...06testswarm-build) 02http://git.io/vTseI
[13:20:26] <m_gol> arschmitz: I was sure I already had a UI Trac account... nothing fit, though so I set up a new account
[13:20:40] <arschmitz> m_gol: our password file got corrupted
[13:20:58] <m_gol> but the m_gol nick was taken :)
[13:20:58] <arschmitz> m_gol: all users got blanked out
[13:21:02] <arschmitz> m_gol: yes
[13:21:04] <m_gol> haha, ok
[13:21:07] <arschmitz> it just the passwords
[13:21:09] <m_gol> so I used mzgol now
[13:21:14] <arschmitz> ok
[13:21:20] <m_gol> I tried to reset the password with both my emails but nothing worked
[13:21:35] <arschmitz> the password reset does not work one of us has to do it manually
[13:21:40] <arschmitz> m_gol: :-/
[13:21:50] <m_gol> ah, I see :)
[13:22:17] <arschmitz> yeah trac is a little broken still
[13:22:28] <arschmitz> or a lot either way
[13:22:33] <m_gol> haha
[13:23:26] <arschmitz> m_gol: now to finish fixing all our breakages from the .offset() change
[13:23:32] <arschmitz> :-)
[13:23:34] <m_gol> :)
[13:44:44] <arschmitz> m_gol: bah im locked out off trac too
[13:50:02] <m_gol> haha
[14:58:07] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: would you consider $.ui.sortable() to be valid?
