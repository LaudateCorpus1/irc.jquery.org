[08:58:06] <jzaefferer> hey gnarf, here's another one for you, review plz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/283
[08:59:21] <gnarf> jzaefferer: roger - i'll dig after meeting
[08:59:52] <jzaefferer> did you see the one scott mentioned earlier as well?
[09:00:01] <jzaefferer> 203
[09:00:09] <gnarf> yeah
[09:00:26] <gnarf> i think that one is ready, but i kinda wanna chat about it
[09:01:03] <gnarf> i hate it when people fix bugs in their master :/ (re 283)
[09:01:10] <jzaefferer> ugh
[09:07:16] <jzaefferer> hey dougneiner, wanna join us in #jquery-meeting?
[10:06:55] <gnarf> jstroem: you here too?
[10:07:13] <gnarf> jstroem: how big are the "implementations" of the effects on their own?
[10:07:13] <jstroem> yeah!
[10:07:28] <jstroem> their own as in spereated files?
[10:07:42] <gnarf> right
[10:07:49] <gnarf> like if you were to make "explode" exist on its own
[10:07:58] <gnarf> etc
[10:08:05] <gnarf> because I think those functions are actually pretty tiny
[10:08:09] <gnarf> most of the work is in the helpers right?
[10:08:11] <jstroem> hmm may i push some of the functionallity out on core?
[10:08:18] <jstroem> yeah!
[10:09:33] <gnarf> jstroem: its either that, or effects.split gives you the helpers
[10:09:40] <gnarf> and effects.pinwheel.js gives you pinwheel
[10:09:49] <gnarf> depends on how much you need to load into core
[10:09:55] <jzaefferer> todd_, yep, that's the one
[10:10:07] <gnarf> jstroem: regarding text effects...
[10:10:13] <gnarf> we discussed this a few meetings ago
[10:10:14] <jstroem> yep we could also do so.
[10:10:27] <jstroem> yep text effects?
[10:10:31] <gnarf> we think we should probably make a new $.fn.textEffect() textHide() textShow()
[10:10:42] <gnarf> that take arguments just like effect/toggle/hide
[10:10:44] <jstroem> right!
[10:11:02] <gnarf> there is some code already started moving this way
[10:11:05] <gnarf> lemme find my branch
[10:11:13] <jstroem> okay.
[10:11:29] <gnarf> i never got any of that code for the text helpers written yet
[10:11:38] <gnarf> but sean ported the demos over
[10:11:54] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/tree/effects-api-text
[10:11:59] <gnarf> its pretty far behind master
[10:12:02] <jstroem> yep i saw that there was a port. i used some of his initial code for my porting too
[10:12:04] <gnarf> but might be a good start
[10:12:05] <gnarf> :)
[10:12:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: pull 203 seems okay to me now btw...
[10:12:59] <jstroem> hmm should i make my own branch on the jquery ui master and then copy paste yours?
[10:13:06] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i commented on pull 283
[10:13:14] <gnarf> jstroem: you can fork off my branch
[10:13:20] <jstroem> okay..
[10:13:40] <gnarf> jstroem: do you know how to add remotes?
[10:13:45] <jstroem> yep
[10:14:13] <jstroem> im slowing getting in to this git nonsens :D
[10:14:15] <gnarf> you can git checkout -b text-effects and then pull from my branch
[10:14:30] <gnarf> you can either branch from your master
[10:14:57] <jstroem> ill make a new branch and then pull your in i think
[10:15:10] <gnarf> jstroem: thats how i'd do it :)
[10:15:44] <jstroem> hmm about the split effects ill try to make the refactoring into each of the files in this weekend
[10:15:50] <gnarf> jstroem: re splitting all those effects into their own code - can you make that on yet another new branch so we can get some file size reports?
[10:16:01] <gnarf> in case we ask you to undo that? :)
[10:16:11] <jstroem> yep good idea!
[10:16:36] <gnarf> because if we end up with a bunch of tiny files, i think i'd rather have them all in one
[10:17:23] <jstroem> mmm but still right now you can choose each effects for themselves when you build a custom jquery_ui ?
[10:17:49] <jstroem> that could be hard with the other setup couldn't it?
[10:18:02] <jstroem> where every effects is in the same file?
[10:18:47] <gnarf> yeah, but like i said -- if the individual effects are like <1k each minified, i'd think it might be alright to just offer those effects as a group
[10:19:01] <gnarf> like currently scale also has size and something else
[10:19:40] <jstroem> yep. okay. but ill do that in another branch as well
[10:20:50] <jstroem> gnarf: can i find the jquery docs meetings calendar anyware so i could take the monday meeting?
[10:21:10] <gnarf> jstroem: i think docs meetings are new
[10:21:17] <gnarf> :)
[10:21:23] <gnarf> 1pm et
[10:21:28] <gnarf> monday
[10:21:53] <jstroem> okay.. hmm and not it is 1:20 pm et right?
[10:21:59] <jstroem> now*
[10:22:03] <gnarf> yup
[10:22:39] <jstroem> time calcs.. yak!
[10:24:29] <jstroem> gnarf: thats all right?
[10:24:49] <gnarf> what is?
[10:25:25] <jstroem> about the effects? because then ill quit freenode :)
[10:25:41] <gnarf> aha - missing comma
[10:25:41] <gnarf> :)
[10:25:53] <jstroem> :D
[10:26:01] <gnarf> yeah - I can't think of anything else I wanted to bring up w/ ya RE split/text
[10:26:30] <jstroem> good.. then cya at monday!
[10:26:30] <gnarf> start lurking freenode more! we're here now!
[10:26:35] <gnarf> :)
[10:34:39] <jzaefferer> hey, good thing I'm not op in here, as I totally tried to mute this channel instead of #jquery-meeting
[10:34:41] <jzaefferer> oops
[10:34:53] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/283 (added comments jzaefferer)
[10:35:48] <gnarf> effects bugs are hard to score for rewardjs ;)
[10:49:12] <gnarf> wow - nice! https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/285
[10:51:26] <gnarf> jzaefferer: is that animate test still broken in swarm?
[10:52:52] <gnarf> anyway, i prolly wont be around much until this weekend
[10:53:00] <gnarf> gotta deal with moving my desk / tons of crap
[10:53:15] <gnarf> and don't get internets at the new place til thursday night
[10:53:59] <jzaefferer> gnarf, you can always just check http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/
[10:54:29] <jzaefferer> still gut that crappy almost unreproducable autocomplete error :/
[10:58:15] <gnarf> jzaefferer: random feature request for swarm -- prev / next job links from the job page? :)
[10:58:36] <jzaefferer> create a ticket :p
[10:59:11] <gnarf> will do when i get back :)
[12:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/308
[14:14:16] <toddparker> hey guys - where is that link to the menubar example page?
[14:48:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that approach looks much better
[14:49:40] <gnarf> i'm diggin deeper
[15:28:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can we add a "git" version to the ui bug tracker?
[15:28:40] <gnarf> or "master" ?
[15:36:20] <gnarf> jzaefferer: hey - got a qunit question for you
[15:36:29] <gnarf> I'm getting width/height of 0 for an element I'm animating
[15:36:38] <gnarf> I assume because its not actually visible
[15:38:18] <gnarf> but sadly, its causing the effect to bug out trying to animate to NaNpx because of a div by 0
[16:15:29] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/310 -- should be an easy pull for you guys ;)
[16:25:31] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: no, you shouldn't be filing bugs against git
[16:26:34] <gnarf> k
[16:26:41] <gnarf> jsut fix em?
[16:27:15] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[16:27:21] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master gnarf * 4fc5ea1 (4 files in 2 dirs): Unit Tests & effects.scale: Fixing bugs in effects unit tests - Particularly IE, found a bug in scale.js in the meantime. Fixes #7395 - Size based effects are breaking unit tests in IE - also leaking a global var
[16:27:21] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master Scott González * b76d42a (4 files in 2 dirs): Merge pull request #310 from gnarf37/ticket-7395 ...
[16:27:21] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master commits 4f0f407...b76d42a - http://bit.ly/lPUCrU
[16:27:35] <gnarf> and jzaefferer - nevermind my qunit question... was a red herring - the element was actually "hidden" :/
[16:27:36] <scott_gonzalez> otherwise we'd end up with ticket for bugs that never existed in a release
[16:28:13] <gnarf> maybe a 1.9pre then?
[16:28:28] <gnarf> although i see what you're saying
[16:32:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/285
[16:33:34] <gnarf> i like the approach
[16:33:41] <gnarf> think its actually gonna solve this one
[16:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> should we land it or did you want to do some more testing?
[16:34:10] <gnarf> just wanna play more with his tests / think on it to see if there is some reason we shouldn't use width: 100%
[16:34:34] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let me know when you want it to land
[16:34:52] <gnarf> will do
[16:35:04] <gnarf> lemme know when you wanna give me the ability to land ;)
[16:35:20] <gnarf> i still need more grooming tho, fo sho
[16:36:36] <gnarf> but that solution is damn clever imo
[16:37:37] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master Scott González * 9d067d3 (1 files in 1 dirs): Merge pull request #306 from jgv/ticket-6097 ... - http://bit.ly/iNlCC8
[16:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: getting very close :-)
[16:38:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it can be like a birthday present....
[16:38:33] * gnarf lolz
[16:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> heh, when's that?

[16:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> maybe :-)
[16:39:25] <gnarf> 9 days from 31
[16:40:15] <gnarf> hard to believe I've almost been programming (not counting BASIC / LOGO) for 2/3's my life now...
[16:42:48] <scott_gonzalez> you don't count BASIC?
[16:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> I used to make rocket ships fly across my monitor in BASIC
[16:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> I also wrote pong in BASIC
[16:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> but since both players used the same keyboard, it was easy to screw with the other person
[16:43:56] <scott_gonzalez> if you pressed a key it would stop the auto-repeat of the other player's key
[16:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> so you could stop their paddle pretty easily
[16:44:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: lol
[16:44:45] <eddiemonge> i wrote security apps in basic
[16:44:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: if I counted BASIC, then its over 2/3rd my life now --- actually approaching 3/4
[16:44:58] <eddiemonge> i was a weird kid
[16:45:03] <gnarf> er eddiemonge
[16:45:04] <gnarf> sry
[16:45:10] <gnarf> whatever
[16:45:21] <gnarf> im getting out of here b4 i get more spaced out
[16:45:26] <gnarf> i got like 3 hours to pack my desks
[16:45:30] <gnarf> and take em apart
[16:45:31] <eddiemonge> pack for what?
[16:45:35] <gnarf> moving
[16:45:42] <eddiemonge> at home or work?
[16:45:47] <gnarf> yes? :)
[16:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[16:46:10] <eddiemonge> new job? or you work at home?
[16:46:12] <gnarf> moving a few blocks away --- closer to work --- need to pack my home office up though....
[16:46:55] <gnarf> no new job -- yet... ;)
[16:47:30] <eddiemonge> im at the same point "...yet..."

[16:48:50] <gnarf> and scott_gonzalez --- I'm okay with the behavior of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/203 now --- Are you?
[16:49:14] <gnarf> it just adds a "swap positions" for "toggle" animations in the "show" direction...
[16:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> heh, haven't looked at it yet
[16:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> but if you're ok with it now, I'll check it out
[16:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[16:50:49] <scott_gonzalez> bot-t: tell bot-t hi
[16:50:51] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Stop playing with me!
[16:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
