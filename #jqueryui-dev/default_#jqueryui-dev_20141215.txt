[06:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: There's no link to the mobile agenda in the #jquery-meeting topic. Is that intentional?
[06:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on moving the links to meetings.jquery.org right now.
[06:32:13] <arschmitz> no
[06:34:33] <arschmitz> yeah i would put it there its a mistake
[06:34:45] <arschmitz> im the one who said to add the css one the other day lol
[06:59:07] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Can you add the URL to https://github.com/jquery/meetings.jquery.org/blob/master/taxonomies.js#L1 ?
[06:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> I've got them in alphabetical order.
[07:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: The Firefox implementation of Intl is mostly written in JavaScript.
[07:10:18] <scott_gonzalez> This has some good info about the stuff we've talked about before (things like potential issues due to relying on the browser to provide the locale data): https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/12/introducing-the-javascript-internationalization-api/
[07:10:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: will do
[07:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Looks like they skipped timezones in Firefox: "Case-insensitive "UTC" will format with respect to UTC. Values like "CEST" and "America/New_York" donâ€™t have to be supported, and they donâ€™t currently work in Firefox."

[07:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> Ignore the IE8 failures, but the other four are animation related and started after the effects rewrite landed.
[07:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> Seems odd that this would've affected draggable tests.
[07:50:46] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Re: "The Firefox implementation of Intl is mostly written in JavaScript". Very interesting. They say it's self-hosted. I'm assuming it's available on the local installation. Is that correct?
[07:51:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, Intl should work in Firefox.
[07:51:51] <rxaviers> I mean, where can we see the source files?
[07:52:27] <rxaviers> PS: I still need to read the article in its entirety
[07:54:30] <scott_gonzalez> http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/builtin/Intl.js
[07:55:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what type of directory structure they use for their code though, so I don't know where everything is and how much is actually hidden in C++.
[07:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/builtin/Intl.cpp
[07:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> This is from me just poking around in the source tree.
[07:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> You can probably ask questions in #content on the Mozilla server.
[08:04:11] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I've scanned through the code and it seems a wrapper of ICU most of the time.
[08:04:48] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[08:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that line in the article was a lie.
[08:05:08] <rxaviers> Most of the code is about matching options into ICU parameters and so on.
[08:05:14] <rxaviers> I've scanned really quickly
[08:05:28] <rxaviers> Let's not assume what I said as too confident though
