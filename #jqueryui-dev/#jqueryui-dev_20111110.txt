[04:22:19] <nVee> hey, is there a way for me to use the jquery dialogue as a replacement for alert?
[04:22:41] <nVee> so I dont want to assign dialogue to a specific dom element, but rather pass a message to the function to display when it's called?

[06:13:39] <everettz> Good morning. I'm down to 2 core widgets (dialog and datepicker) that need accessibility testing. There are also 3 tasks that need testing from keyboard only, without assistive technology enabled - http://zufelt.ca/blog/jquery-ui-accessibility-review-update-2
[07:46:09] <rpflo> how's the 1.9 release coming along?
[09:29:32] <opie_> it's been almost a year since i've done any serious widget development. I'm so happy with all the new features, _bind, _super. great work team
[11:37:26] <kborchers> so i think it would be nice for menu (and probably just in general) to have these http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/PCzJU/ anyone have thoughts, concerns, improvements?
[12:21:46] <kborchers> well, definitely found some issues with my findUntil ... i'll keep working on them but i think they will be useful
[13:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> rpflo: slow, but steady
[13:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> opie_: :-)
[13:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I'm not sure if .findFirst() should stop at the first element that it finds or first level that it finds
[13:59:59] <Dave_Stein> gnarf, what was that .box() idea you had? i saw you say it a few times but never what it was
[14:01:08] <rworth> Dave_Stein: my guess is http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7738
[14:01:47] <rworth> but I could be wrong, maybe gnarf had a genuine idea for .box()
[15:46:50] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: .box() would return {top,left,bottom,right,width,height} and allow setting multiples of those
[15:46:58] <gnarf> that was my idea
[15:50:10] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: you mean to get the location of an element and then use that data in whatever way, which in our discussion would be to make a div with those coords and dimensions to cover the iframe?
[15:50:22] <gnarf> right
[15:50:41] <Dave_Stein> I wrote a function $.fn.clonePosition() which pretty much does that, based off of Prototypes when I made the switch to jQuery
[15:50:53] <gnarf> or you could $("<iframe>").box( elem.box() )
[15:50:59] <Dave_Stein> it moves the element to the src object and theres options for copying width, height, left, top etc
[15:51:29] <Dave_Stein> $('iframe').each( function() { $('<div />').clonePosition( $(this) );  });
[15:51:51] <Dave_Stein> $('<div />').appendTo( $('body') ).clonePosition
[15:52:04] <Dave_Stein> would help if the div was in dom to move it :)
[15:53:18] <gnarf> var divCoverrs = $("iframe").each( function() { return $("<div>").box( $(this).box() ).appendTo("body").get(); });
[15:53:23] <gnarf> oopes
[15:53:26] <gnarf> map not each
[15:53:56] <Dave_Stein> gotcha
[15:54:03] <Dave_Stein> oh anyway while i have ya, a more important issue i'm having
[15:54:06] <Dave_Stein> with draggable
[15:54:12] <Dave_Stein> i tried to do away with my css calculation for a relative div
[15:54:41] <Dave_Stein> if theres a div with 100px padding, and a relative div with 50px padding, followed by the draggable that's relative that has style:top10px
[15:55:03] <Dave_Stein> i couldn't figure out a way with math of offset and position cached values to not eff up
[15:55:27] <Dave_Stein> cause a relative draggable inside a relative div, the "position" is totally based on its css
[15:55:43] <Dave_Stein> cause ya know offset would give me like 160 and position would give me 60
[15:55:54] <Dave_Stein> so i can't factor in the 10px from the style, or so i thought
[15:56:29] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: follow all that jumbo?
[15:56:39] <gnarf> kinda
[15:56:51] <gnarf> kborchers: might be able to give you more insignt in positioning shit too
[15:56:56] <gnarf> but
[15:57:25] <gnarf> I could take a look with you a little later (kinda busy with work atm)
[15:57:48] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[15:58:02] <Dave_Stein> well i got one quick question before you get back to work for my dad ironically
[15:58:14] <Dave_Stein> is there a difference in the base CSS of UI between 1.8.2 and 1.8.16 ?
[15:58:32] <Dave_Stein> i haven't redownloaded CSS since like 1.6 and nothings ever broken so im not sure when that gets changed
[15:59:03] <Dave_Stein> we can skype around 10 if ya want, leaving work soon, gotta decompress, eat, and then jquery
[15:59:06] <Dave_Stein> :)
[16:00:16] <Dave_Stein> nm i found it, and my dad says he can code for 30+ years pft
[16:03:21] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: im heading off... ill turn skype on when i get home with speakres on so give a ring and i can pick up if im not playing dark souls lol
[16:03:26] <Dave_Stein> i hate how you cant pause in that game
[19:12:24] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: egad
[19:23:44] <gnarf> hey
[19:26:04] <Dave_Stein> hows it goin
[19:28:17] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: still workin away? im at home boucning between desk and not
