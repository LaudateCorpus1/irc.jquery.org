[08:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers jzaefferer: I want to move .ui-progressbar-indeterminate to the main element, not the value div.
[08:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> Any objection?
[08:03:31] <kborchers> no, that probably makes more sense really
[08:04:09] <kborchers> by no, i mean no objection if that wasn't clear enough :)
[08:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, it was clear :-)

[08:18:34] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i haven't tested it but this won't cause issues? https://gist.github.com/9ec9a92974f5bfc1fe4a#file-themes-base-jquery-ui-progressbar-css-diff-L9
[08:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> Why would it?
[08:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> There's nothing else applying rules to the overlay.
[08:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> This is just reducing the specificity for cleanliness.
[08:20:36] <kborchers> ok, that's fine
[08:21:38] <kborchers> i guess i usually try to be more specific than i need to be

[10:50:11] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: No browser in specific. I've seen it in pretty much every browser.
[10:50:21] <scott_gonzalez> I assume it's not jquery-ui specific.
[10:51:14] <Krinkle> ok, its either network issues at browserstack (ruled out if you get the same in your own local browser), or the sql issue we're seeing with some queries causing mysql locks, and thus temporarily halting all other simultanous requests.
[10:54:20] <scott_gonzalez> I get it in my local Safari as well.
[11:01:10] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: I'm hoping to get some mysql stuff in Splunk to figure out what the cause is
[11:01:17] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:01:25] <Krinkle> I recall gnarf having set this up on jq03, I forgot where it was located thoguh
[11:01:41] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: going to look at your commments / check my email settings shortly
[11:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be back in about 15 minutes.
[11:11:14] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: ah yeah after github had security issues my email became unverified - pretty sure thats why i got no emails. and now i requrested a verification email and it hasnt arrived yet so fingers crossed there
[11:12:00] <Dave_Stein> and other emails were marked as spam oi
[11:12:38] <Dave_Stein> when you get back make some random comment to make sure i get the emails now
[11:22:45] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Maybe you know how to make this pass? http://codepen.io/joe/pen/CDxBG
[11:22:53] <Krinkle> I've been trying different things, but not sure how to do it
[11:23:04] <Krinkle> I tried filtering :visible, but it has different nestings.
[11:23:31] <Krinkle> .removing() could do, but then the thing is broken. Tried .clone() but then the css isn't live anymore.

[11:23:56] <Dave_Stein> I think I'm only missing bottom of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/44330395e1dca3d41e134d74fd1f66a247d8fe6e comments which are the tests, simplification, and changes to option
[11:24:17] <Krinkle> trying to keep it simple/clean (I guess using the clone to restore it and removing from the live one would work, or using absolute position) but would prefer to avoid htat.
[11:24:26] <Dave_Stein> i wish you just told me "stop using single quotes" i feel bad with you writing that comment again and again ha
[11:25:03] <Krinkle> Dave_Stein: Isn't that caught by jshint? What editor are you using / running grunt before commit
[11:26:40] <Dave_Stein> Krinkle: I have to setup grunt, was just talkin to Mikesherov about that yesterday
[11:27:24] <Krinkle> if you have node/npm set up, it'll be working already. grunt comes with the repo through npm dependencies (you can install grunt-cli if you want to make it easier to run)
[11:28:10] <Dave_Stein> ok cool i'll take a look when I can, before next commit. I'm on a PC so I hear that makes things a bit more fun
[11:29:48] <Krinkle> yeah, there's a higher bar to get things started on windows, but once you have node set up, it should be the same as anywhere else.
[11:30:06] <Krinkle> npm, grunt, jshint etc. they all run on node
[11:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: you'd need to just walk the DOM yourself.
[11:31:22] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: You want me to comment on a commit to test notificatons?
[11:31:50] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: yeah that'd be good just to be safe
[11:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> done
[11:32:11] <Dave_Stein> i marked a few as not spam + verified my email so it should come through fine now
[11:32:21] <Dave_Stein> "move up"
[11:32:24] <Dave_Stein> k thats set
[11:32:38] <Dave_Stein> should backCompats be in alpha order like the options btw?
[11:33:32] <scott_gonzalez> Order of back compat doesn't matter.
[11:33:48] <scott_gonzalez> Those will just end up in the order you implement them :-)
[11:35:47] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: The repeated commenting is a habit from PR review.
[11:36:19] <scott_gonzalez> With a PR, the comments would disappear if the mistake was fixed.
[11:37:15] <Dave_Stein> ah
[11:37:41] <Dave_Stein> oh what did this comment mean "One thing I've been wondering about is whether we need to explicitly include option since we include select."
[11:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> Do we need to list "option" in the exclude selector?
[11:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> We already have "select" in there.
[11:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> I assume events bubble from option to select.
[11:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> When I say "I've been wondering" I mean for the past few years :-P
[11:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> It just hasn't been important enough to me to actually check...
[11:39:49] <Dave_Stein> ohhhh gotcha -> I can look into that later
[11:40:43] <scott_gonzalez> On a totally unrelated note, I think it'd be fun to build a 3d model of my entire house in SketchUp.
[11:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> But then I think, "Yeah, this will be fun like web dev is fun"
[11:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> And I start wondering what the IE6 of 3d modeling is...
[11:41:14] <Dave_Stein> i saw sortable has a million comments... not even looking until dragable is done... and to your unrelated note i did that of my bedroom in 3d studio max in high school
[11:41:41] <Dave_Stein> it's fun to learn but then you start to go nuts getting all the curves of modling right
[11:41:42] <Dave_Stein> haha
[11:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> I just built this model of my basement step (first 3d model I've built) to figure out how we're going to build a closet and reading area for the kids: http://cl.ly/image/0M1c0t3f2w0C
[11:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> The green walls are where the kids will be able to lay down/read/play games.
[11:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> The yellow will be the closet (actually the cat room for the litter pan and their food).
[11:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to put their old crib mattresses in there and some drawers on the bottom.
[11:44:19] <Dave_Stein> that is some intense planning
[11:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> It took me a few days to get the hang of it.
[11:44:29] <Dave_Stein> i still live in a studio sans kids with fiance and cat 
[11:45:48] <Dave_Stein> how old are your kids?
[11:46:54] <scott_gonzalez> 3 and 4.5
[11:47:08] <Dave_Stein> i think non-programmers would say 4 1/2 :D
[11:47:34] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:47:37] <Dave_Stein> i'm so far from kids right now and I only tell my fiance "at least 1" cause I'm not sure about 2. She contends that once you have one, one more isn't that much more different
[11:48:02] <scott_gonzalez> My parents always say if I was the first kid, they wouldn't have had a second :-P
[11:48:27] <Dave_Stein> i was 7 1/2 years after my brother and they asked if i wanted another sibling and i never cared enough for them to try apparently
[11:52:49] <rxaviers> I think the "ie6" of it is getting pretty heavy when the project starts getting big. At least, that's the only cons I found when scketching my home
[11:54:35] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You sketched your house?
[11:54:52] <rxaviers> yeap, in the heat of learning it
[11:54:53] <rxaviers> hehe
[11:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> Just for fun or do you actually have a practical purpose?
[11:55:38] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Thanks, got it working http://codepen.io/joe/pen/CDxBG
[11:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: I think that's the old pen.
[11:56:21] <Krinkle> refresh, codepen has saving/revisions
[11:57:36] <rxaviers> we're building it, so I wanted to see how things would look in advace
[11:57:39] <rxaviers> advance*
[11:57:43] <scott_gonzalez> Weird, if I open the editor panel, then it shows the old code. If I open the deatils panel, it shows the updated results.
[11:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: cool
[11:58:07] <rxaviers> it's helps some decisions
[11:58:08] <rxaviers> :)
[12:14:29] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: apparently my css lead used sketchup to mock up her room too. I guess I should look at that when I move next 
[12:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> It didn't take long to figure out the basics of it.
[12:16:31] <scott_gonzalez> There's still plenty to learn though.
[12:19:41] <rxaviers> your stairways seemed a pretty good work to me

[13:22:15] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers
[13:22:21] <rxaviers> yep
[13:22:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/48
[13:22:36] <rxaviers> (Im alerted on my name or all)
[13:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to figure out where to list the deps.
[13:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> I currently have it toward the end of the long desc:  http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[13:29:28] <tj_vantoll> Looks good to me.  Might be nice to have it up top, say after Description.  But considering you have to give information about optional dependencies I'd say the bulleted is good.
[13:29:53] <tj_vantoll> I don't think the common user will be that interested in the dependencies anyways.
[13:30:14] <tj_vantoll> *bulleted list* is good
[13:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> Right, most users will have their dependencies figure out automatically by the download builder.
[13:30:57] <scott_gonzalez> And those who do their own builds will probably either know the deps or check the header comments.
[13:31:15] <rxaviers> yeap, Im trying to find a similar project that has a similar doc to see.
[13:31:24] <rxaviers> 1st: Im trying to find a similar project that has a similar doc to see.
[13:31:32] <scott_gonzalez> And the end of the description is apparently where we used to list them: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[13:31:34] <rxaviers> 2nd: yeap, I think DB would handle it
[13:32:04] <rxaviers> (for user not to care)
[13:32:38] <rxaviers> what's the use case when user wants to know it?
[13:32:47] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll keep it there and add the info to the rest of the files.
[13:32:52] <tj_vantoll> Here's a Dojo example - http://dojotoolkit.org/api/dijit/Calendar.
[13:33:05] <tj_vantoll> See "Extends: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.8/dijit/CalendarLite, http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.8/dijit/_Widget, http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.8/dijit/_CssStateMixin"
[13:33:08] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Not sure, but https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/14
[13:33:56] <rxaviers> "for those of us who include the individual files one-by-one"
[13:33:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we could make it smaller.
[13:34:07] <scott_gonzalez> It really depends how much info we want to include for the optional dependencies.
[13:35:01] <tj_vantoll> Agreed.  If it weren't for that I'd put it in smaller text under "Description".  That being said I like the information on optional dependencies.
[13:35:26] <tj_vantoll> And I think just having them listed is the most important thing, where isn't all that big of deal really.
[13:36:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'd hate to put something this big way up top.
[13:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> If we were just doing the links, I like what dojo has.
[13:37:51] <rxaviers> I couldnt help much. But, I think it's good where it's now.
[13:38:07] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[13:38:20] <rxaviers> It's a info for users who wants to tweak a little but anyway. So, he is able to crawl that
[13:38:34] <rxaviers> npmjs example https://npmjs.org/package/simple-log (I know it is a very different scope, but)
[14:09:13] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, don't know how I missed this: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/
[14:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, it's really only been 2 months?
[14:10:02] <scott_gonzalez> It feels like so long ago.

[19:54:22] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: around?
[19:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[19:54:51] <kborchers> wow, wasn't expecting you to be here this late
[19:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> I literally just opened my laptop :-P
[19:55:14] <kborchers> heh
[19:55:17] <kborchers> i'm doing some a11y testing on progressbar
[19:56:05] <kborchers> everything looks good except i don't get any announcement on the indeterminate progressbar ‚Ä¶ wondering if we should set aria-valuetext to "indeterminate"
[19:56:12] <kborchers> when we remove the aria-valuenow
[19:56:44] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-valuetext
[19:57:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[19:58:07] <kborchers> using nvda and FF, not sure on others
[19:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> If we have to use aria-valuetext, then we need to make the text customizable.
[19:59:24] <kborchers> :/
[20:00:40] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: would it be confusing to change it from value: false to value: "some string" for indeterminate?
[20:01:11] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[20:01:15] <kborchers> yeah
[20:01:29] <kborchers> so another option?
[20:01:42] <kborchers> if we use valuetext
[20:02:10] <kborchers> i think i would like Hans's opinion
[20:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> VoiceOver announces "ineeterminate progress indicator"
[20:03:06] <kborchers> o_O
[20:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> Without the typo :-P
[20:03:50] <kborchers> "indeterminate progress bar, on the main level"
[20:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[20:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> The progress is on the main level :-)
[20:06:25] <kborchers> hmm, another possible issue is the pb isn't focusable so after the initial announcement from voice over, i can't check it again. 
[20:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if we should make them focusable automatically. We could ping Hans about that.
[20:08:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, maybe a quick review from him would be helpful
[20:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> He didn't make it accessible in his demos.
[20:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> s/accessible/focusable/
[20:08:31] <kborchers> ok
[20:09:51] <kborchers> on a completely unrelated topic, i am really starting to like angular (especially with yeoman generators) ‚Ä¶ glad that terrible app i saw was just done all wrong :)
[20:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[20:13:48] <kborchers> done wrong and typescript, double whammy
