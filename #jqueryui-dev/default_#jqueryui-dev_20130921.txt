[05:20:18] <agcolom> uGoMobi: scott_gonzalez: I seem to have lots of different versions of php. How do I know which one is used by Wordpress?
[05:21:18] <agcolom> (one of which is 5.4.10)
[05:26:36] <AlexanderBB10> https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/bbm/id690046600?mt=8
[07:57:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: are you using MAMP?

[07:59:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: if so, go to preferences in MAMP and select PHP tab. There you'll see the PHP version you are running on your server
[08:01:35] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the PHP version is something you manage on your server, it's not that WordPress is using a specific version
[08:02:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! I installed a PHP proxy so I can show people my work on the API docs: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/proxy.php?http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/classes/
[08:02:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can you open that URL?
[08:02:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey!
[08:03:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool
[08:03:06] * uGoMobi is trying now
[08:03:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It may be slow ...
[08:03:47] <uGoMobi> yeah, it's still loading
[08:03:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: D00d!
[08:04:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: BTW: Do you want me to mark those style properties as deprecated? The ones arschmitz lists in that doc?
[08:04:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was about to ask you how I can preview the API docs 1-4 branch local
[08:04:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's non-trivial.
[08:04:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that would be great
[08:04:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Can do.
[08:04:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks
[08:05:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I installed WordPress local and when on master in API docs repo I can do grunt deploy... all fine
[08:05:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You need to download wordpress, and set up a NameVirtualHost, and then clone jquery-wp-content into the wordpress subdirectory.
[08:05:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK, so you're past that point? Good!
[08:05:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yup, I've done all that
[08:05:53] <uGoMobi> :)
[08:06:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then it should be as simple as git checkout 1-4; grunt wordpress-deploy
[08:06:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Did that URL work?
[08:06:23] <uGoMobi> grunt wordpress-deploy ?
[08:06:31] <uGoMobi> I did grunt deploy
[08:06:36] <uGoMobi> and got error
[08:06:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, URL not working. it doesn't load
[08:07:05] <_|Nix|_> Grrr!
[08:07:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I always do grunt wordpress-deploy
[08:07:45] <uGoMobi> doesn't work for me with grunt wordpress-deploy either
[08:07:53] <uGoMobi> works on master, not in 1-4 :/
[08:08:12] <uGoMobi> I run npm install again
[08:09:09] <uGoMobi> ok, I didn't know I had to run npm install while in the branch
[08:09:25] <uGoMobi> I only ran it while on master
[08:09:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I didn't know either, but I guess some of the prereqs might've changed.

[13:51:51] <tj_vantoll> If anyone is around by chance I'm wondering whether the i18n files for datepicker are on jQuery's CDN. I can't seem to find them.

[14:05:28] <uGoMobi> tj_vantoll: I don't see them on the codeorigin repo
[14:07:36] <tj_vantoll> uGoMobi: Ah thanks. I couldn't find the repo.
[14:07:58] <tj_vantoll> Hmmm, wonder why they're not there. Google's CDN has them.
[14:14:32] <uGoMobi> tj_vantoll: in a subfolder?
[14:15:53] <uGoMobi> tj_vantoll: just curious where you see them on Google CDN, because I don't
[14:16:02] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, there's an i18n folder: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.3/i18n/jquery-ui-i18n.min.js
[14:16:19] <tj_vantoll> Doesn't appear to be documented anywhere. Random Stack Overflow question is where I discovered this.
[14:18:39] <tj_vantoll> Hmmm, Globalize doesn't appear to be on the CDN either.
[14:19:50] <uGoMobi> tj_vantoll: it could be that things have been moved to another location
[14:20:15] <uGoMobi> tj_vantoll: scott_gonzalez and gnarf have been cleaning up the CDN and moved things that didn't really belong there
[14:20:34] <uGoMobi> tj_vantoll: like Mobile's zip files
[14:21:30] <tj_vantoll> ok
[14:21:44] <uGoMobi> not sure if datepicker i18n files is something that belongs on a CDN or not, just sayin' :)
[14:22:51] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I'm torn as well. I think the use case is someone using the library from the CDN doesn't want to host jQuery UI locally just to use datepickers with different locales.
[14:24:17] <tj_vantoll> It's convenient for examples too. Which is my use case and why I asked :)
[14:25:03] <tj_vantoll> Anyways, I think my children are getting up so I've got to go. Thanks for the help. I'm sure scott_gonzalez will see this conversation at some point and enlighten us.
[15:17:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: WTF?! http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/buttons/ ... no icons ...

[15:17:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looks like icon-only is broken
[15:18:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I noticed while I was working on the API entry.
[15:19:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I made a change in theme CSS this week. lemme check if I broke it
[15:21:02] <uGoMobi> hmm I don't see typos or anything
[15:25:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I found the problem
[15:25:25] <uGoMobi> specificity issue
[15:25:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome!
[15:53:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I have to puzzle a bit to avoid regressions when fixing the icon-only buttons but will commit the fix tonight
[15:56:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Alright.
[15:56:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good luck!
