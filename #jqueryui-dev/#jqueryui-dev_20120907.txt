[00:55:47] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: "We're not reading zips, though our tests would be better if we were actually deflating the zip and verifying the contents. Right now we're just reaching into the code that's using zipstream and verifying that it's piping in the correct files." - we had that and dropped it, it was pretty slow and inefficient.

[04:32:40] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/34
[04:33:49] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm actually going to work on that today/this weekend.
[04:42:54] <jzaefferer> okay
[04:54:12] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: thoughts on that new look for the banner heading? http://stage.plugins.jquery.com
[04:54:27] <kborchers> it's simple but it works
[04:54:42] <kborchers> not in IE though (text-shadow)
[05:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe a slightly lighter color, but I think the styling is fine.
[05:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> The gradient lightened it up a lot.
[05:10:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmmm, i can give it a shot, you lose the text-shadow when you go much lighter
[05:10:23] <kborchers> hard to see it and starts to just look "fuzzy"
[05:11:32] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I guess just leave it alone then.
[05:13:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, that's a simple color change if we decide it needs to be changed
[05:14:03] <kborchers> we just may have to take the text-shadow off then … which doesn't show in IE <= 9 anyway
[05:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> I wish we had a style guide for our markup.
[05:19:24] <scott_gonzalez> When to use article, section, aside, which classes to use for design breakpoints, when to reset header levels, etc.
[05:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> Right now the markup is a total mess.
[05:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Am I crazy or does this work? http://jsfiddle.net/MPQsR/1/
[05:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8556
[05:52:12] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: oh, i see what he's talking about
[05:52:23] <kborchers> the sentence at the top of the fiddle is misleading
[05:52:55] <kborchers> click in the the first date field then select a date. it should open the second date field but it opens then closes
[05:53:02] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ^
[05:53:31] <scott_gonzalez> Aha.
[05:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> His description was horrible :-/
[05:53:41] <kborchers> yep
[05:53:49] <kborchers> i looked at the code and saw what he meant
[05:54:14] <scott_gonzalez> I had only looked at the code from the first hiddle (with the /1) since that one actually does break.
[05:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> If this is a regression, it's super old.
[05:56:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'm already back to 1.8.13 and still seeing the problem.
[05:57:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i swear that was known and fixed at some point though, just don't remember when. i could be crazy too
[05:57:33] <kborchers> but if you're that far back, probably not
[05:58:18] <scott_gonzalez> Exists in 1.8.0
[05:58:42] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I think the bug that was fixed is the one he actually describes.
[05:58:55] <kborchers> oh, right!
[05:59:10] <scott_gonzalez> Works in 1.7.3.
[05:59:15] <kborchers> :/
[05:59:25] <scott_gonzalez> So this isn't something we have to worry about.
[05:59:37] <scott_gonzalez> It can just the hundreds of other bugs waiting for rewrites :-P
[05:59:40] <kborchers> yeah
[05:59:48] <scott_gonzalez> My concern right now is just not having regressions in 1.9.
[06:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Has PHP always been this liberal? I feel like you couldn't do this years ago: $demoList->{$post->post_name}
[06:42:55] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yes. but you still couldn't do someFunction()['some-key'] until PHP 5.4
[06:43:23] <scott_gonzalez> You also couldn't do empty( somFunction() ), right?
[06:43:33] <nacin> correct.
[06:43:56] <nacin> empty() is a construct, though, that works on variables similar to isset(). so ! someFunction() is equivalent.
[06:46:26] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: This is the best way to handle something like the more tag, right? https://gist.github.com/92302ac79c491f0016e8
[06:47:27] <nacin> keep in mind $post->post_name will not be hierarchical
[06:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this will be used on flat plages.
[06:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com/<plugin-name>
[06:48:08] <nacin> but yes, that looks quite nice.
[06:49:14] <nacin> might be better to do a straight str_replace( '<!—demos—>', 'iframe…', $content ) rather than the awkward splice, but up to you.
[06:50:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I want the early bail out though.
[06:51:08] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if it makes much of a difference once I already do the detection.
[06:51:20] <scott_gonzalez> It's going to be more complicated than just inserting the iframe.
[06:51:42] <scott_gonzalez> But yeah, I can change the final replacement to str_replace().
[07:09:23] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: the thing that caught me was the use of a magic number (12). I'd keep the strpos() still.
[07:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Yup, already updated.
[07:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/92302ac79c491f0016e8
[07:10:57] <nacin> nice.
[07:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm about to write some code that absolutely will not work without JS.
[07:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> Normally I'd be against doing that, but it seems reasonable since the entire purpose of the page is to demo a JS library...
[07:13:51] <ryanneu__> but what about blackberry users?
[07:14:02] * ryanneu__ ducks
[07:22:55] <scott_gonzalez> Oh crap, we have a race condition.
[07:28:35] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: where?
[07:29:03] <scott_gonzalez> When adding or removing resources via grunt-wordpress.
[07:29:15] <kborchers> uh oh :/
[07:29:22] <scott_gonzalez> Since the resource info is just stored in a file.
[07:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I need to use file locks.
[07:31:01] <scott_gonzalez> I could also take the easy way out and just process files in parallel :-P
[07:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> *not* process files in parallel.
[07:31:29] <kborchers> :)
[08:32:44] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: not sure WHAT to do about docs.jquery.com, you just know we need some sort of tombstone for those pages or we'll get a deluge of complaints about them being gone when people do google searches
[08:33:25] * scott_gonzalez does not step to help
[08:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> jeez, now I'm missing whole words when I type.
[08:34:26] <nacin> There aren't that many pages on there, right? Most of them have a 1:1 match that could be a redirect.
[08:35:14] <nacin> Ah, most redirect already.
[08:43:11] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: we can redirect them
[08:43:37] <DaveMethvin> except for the ones we don't want to redirect and just want to kill, like "Sites using jQuery"
[08:43:48] <DaveMethvin> we just got a request this week to be added there
[08:44:58] <gnarf> hrm
[08:45:31] <DaveMethvin> one of the "sites using jQuery" is dell.com, they are on jQuery 1.2.2 :D
[08:53:47] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/6yCemA
[08:53:47] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Parse titles and descriptions out of demos for use on the site. - Scott González
[09:13:09] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/ZyaeDg
[09:13:09] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Added autocomplete page. - Scott González
[09:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> Haven't implemented the js yet, but... http://stage.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[09:16:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: nice
[10:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is there a function to get posts from a category by slug or do I need to get the category id and then pass that to a query?
[10:05:07] <nacin> you can pass category_name=
[10:05:34] <nacin> there's actually a way to do rather advanced taxonomy queries, but that one happens to exist.
[10:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[10:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> If I just need to get the name and URL is that query_posts() a bad choice?
[10:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I guess we shouldn't use this since it changes the main loop.
[10:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Should I just use WP_Query() directly?
[10:12:11] <nacin> yeah.
[10:12:25] <nacin> get_posts() is basically the same as WP_Query, only that the object itself is more powerful.
[10:12:41] <nacin> query_posts() modifies the main WP_Query object, and should never be used. (We use pre_get_posts instead.)
[10:13:19] <nacin> you can however just pass get_posts( array( 'category_name' => 'slug' ) ) fairly easily.
[10:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: For the pages on jqueryui.com, I want to add categories.
[10:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> Should I make them posts or is there something I should do to make pages accept categories?
[10:32:24] <nacin> add_action( 'init', function() { register_taxonomy_for_object_type( 'category', 'page' ); } );
[10:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: How do you change the default category?
[10:43:13] <scott_gonzalez> I somehow ended up without an uncategorized category and now pages with no category are getting put into a category :-/
[10:44:00] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I imagine the default_post_category option would also apply to pages.
[10:44:28] <nacin> If that category doesn't exist, it'll show "Uncategorized" without an actual link — in label only.
[10:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it somehow set the Interactions category as the default.
[10:45:01] <scott_gonzalez> And I can't figure out how to change that.
[10:48:05] <scott_gonzalez> Got it. I deleted Uncategorized, then edited Interactions so that it was Uncategorized :-P
[10:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> Then redploying fixed which posts were where.
[10:59:59] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Did codex just get a deploy?
[11:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> It's broken
[11:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_permalink
[11:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, interesting, something linked to https
[11:00:33] <nacin> appears https versus http
[11:00:37] <nacin> Shouldn't break either way, though.
[11:01:25] <nacin> hmm. can you not @import an http URL from an https page?
[11:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> seems weird
[11:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> I would expect that to work, though I guess it's mixed content.
[11:14:22] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/_VR67w
[11:14:22] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] More pages. - Scott González
[11:28:35] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: You might want to reach out to your contact a pledgie and tell them that the amounts shown on account pages are incorrect.
[11:28:36] <scott_gonzalez> http://pledgie.com/accounts/mcbazon
[11:29:03] <scott_gonzalez> Shows $2,709.00 total raised, but that's actually the amount in Euros.
[11:53:29] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: cool, will pass it along
[13:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers jzaefferer rworth: Making progress :-) http://stage.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[13:02:19] <rworth> looking good
[13:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> koopersmith: This is your chance to tell us how ugly the flash is when loading a new demo ;-)
[13:07:58] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! This is looking really good!!!!
[13:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Thanks, still lots of work to do, but we're getting there :-)
[13:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know if there's something like document.innerHTML?
[13:08:59] <scott_gonzalez> I want to get the full source of the iframe.
[13:09:42] <agcolom> just one thing... the list of widgets in longer than the background, but you may have seen that already...
[13:09:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, kswedberg broke it.
[13:10:11] <koopersmith> scott_gonzalez: hahaha
[13:10:17] <kswedberg> woohoo!
[13:11:07] <kswedberg> hey koopersmith! long time, no talk.
[13:13:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: so it looks like I'm going to have to make some changes to get the same style as you with the menu on the right hand-side... but I don't mind as I think that's much better!
[13:13:30] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: apparently that is a long standing pledgie bug that i provided a convenient reminder of :p
[13:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You mean for jquerymobile.com?
[13:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: heh
[13:14:11] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: just answered this in dev but ... document.documentElement.innerHTML
[13:14:42] <agcolom> oh! just noticed this is not the api docs!
[13:14:49] <agcolom> Sorry I got confused!
[13:15:13] <agcolom> are you going to have the same style for the api docs?
[13:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/
[13:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/ already has the same style.
[13:16:30] <agcolom> yes, just had a look! OMG this has changed as well!!!! It looks great!
[13:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> :-) kborchers and I spent a bunch of time on it.
[13:17:21] <ajpiano> wow scott_gonzalez kborchers +9001
[13:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> We still need to move some styles out of the UI theme and into the base theme.
[13:17:39] <koopersmith> hey kswedberg! will I be seeing you in october?
[13:17:57] <kswedberg> absolutely! glad to hear you're gonna make it. :)
[13:18:41] <koopersmith> this time around I'll have a bit more time to prepare. :)
[13:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: For example, you'll notice the QuickNav at the top of a widget page isn't styled properly yet on the mobile site.
[13:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom toddmparker_: Do you have a planned release date for the new mobile sites?
[13:19:21] <agcolom> yes, I've just redeployed (after a pull) and I also don't get the nice box for method and option
[13:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Is that something you're going to work on?
[13:20:21] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Not sure about the date at all... I guess sometime after the October meeting?
[13:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok, then I won't worry about keeping everything 100% up to date.
[13:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> We're hoping to deploy the UI sites very soon.
[13:22:31] <agcolom> ok.
[13:22:32] <kswedberg> hey scott_gonzalez : any ideas on how we can get the single-file xml of the whole api site together? maybe a grunt task that concatenates the entries files and categories.xml?
[13:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Yeah, we can put that into a grunt task.
[13:22:54] <kswedberg> i.e. were you going to do that? :)
[13:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> I can do that.
[13:23:01] <kswedberg> awesome!
[13:23:04] <kswedberg> thx
[13:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> Is it just a concat of all the docs?
[13:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> Are there any wrappers or anything that get added?
[13:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> I would look at the existing one, but I'm kind of afraid of opening it.
[13:25:15] <kswedberg> haha. just <api><categories> <!-- all the categories --> </categories> <entries <!-- all the entries --> </entries></api>
[13:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:25:26] <kswedberg> *<entries>
[13:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'll add that and move the XSL into grunt-jquery-content.
[13:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> Now that we're pretty much done.
[13:26:31] <kswedberg> For each entry, you gotta strip out <?xml version="1.0"?>
[13:26:44] <kswedberg> awesome!
[13:27:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: is someone going to add the new style for mobile (api docs) or do I need to copy something from UI?
[13:27:11] <kswedberg> and for entries like .attr.xml, you also gotta strip out <entries> and </entries>
[13:27:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I was just gonna say that :-)
[13:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: We'll move the styles so they apply.
[13:28:31] <agcolom> thank you :-) I looks really good! I can't wait to see what mobile will look like!
[13:43:18] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: kborchers: just one thing.... I am wondering whether .desc needs font-weight: normal
[13:43:48] <agcolom> I'm not saying it needs changing, but i think it's worth having the discussion....
[13:45:34] <agcolom> it's just because under example, the description is in bold but the description elsewhere (next to Description at the top) is in "normal" font-weight...
[13:47:00] <agcolom> but then maybe you wanted the example description to be in bold... I'm not sure...
[14:04:42] <scott_gonzalez> oy, document.documentElement.innerHTML was a bad idea.
[14:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> That results in the DOM after it's been modified by the widget.
[14:18:52] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Any objection to killing off the demo system in the jquery-ui repo?
[14:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers gnarf: Thoughts?
[14:20:55] <scott_gonzalez> I want to get rid of this: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/index.html
[14:21:15] <scott_gonzalez> Just have the individual demos.
[14:21:17] <rworth> that's fine
[14:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> I can replace it with something like this: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/index.html
[14:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> That page actually needs to be updated.
[14:23:07] <rworth> sure
