[03:01:18] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hi scott, I have removed completely the iframes that are now unnecessary, and I am finding the loading of the button page is much faster. (i.e. I don't have that long time when you can't interact with the page anymore)

[05:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: This is what happens...
[05:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> The default is `cancel: "input,textarea,button,select,option"`
[05:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> Which makes things like draggable and sortable actually sane.
[05:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> Because it let's you place focus into form elements via a click.
[05:02:20] <scott_gonzalez> Instead of treating the mousedown as the beginning of a drag/sort.
[05:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> But when someone wants to actually use the cancel option, they set it to the thing they care about.
[05:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> For example, `cancel: ".close"`
[05:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> And that blows away the form control canceling.
[05:03:18] <scott_gonzalez> And all of a sudden, you can't click on a text field to focus it.
[05:04:00] <scott_gonzalez> I can't think of a time when you'd want an interaction to win over a form control.
[05:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally we'd be able to implement the touch-scrolling logic.
[05:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> In Mobile Safari, you can start scrolling the page from a link or text field.
[05:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> But if you don't scroll at all, then it counts as clicking that element.
[05:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> And there's a few pixels tolerance before a drag starts.
[05:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: hmm...I'm not seeing a difference on stage.
[05:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> 47 requests  ‚ùò  15.58KB transferred  ‚ùò  5.09s (onload: 4.94s, DOMContentLoaded: 585ms)
[05:10:02] <scott_gonzalez> For comparison, the is jQuery UI's button page:
[05:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> 38 requests  ‚ùò  15.32KB transferred  ‚ùò  964ms (onload: 964ms, DOMContentLoaded: 554ms)
[05:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> Which is also kinda heavy, but not nearly as bad. 1s vs. 5s for interaction.
[05:12:21] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHAHA http://cl.ly/image/173C2R0v071q
[05:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> I wish that wasn't a fake email address.
[09:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Doesn't this fail in some browsers? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/947/files#L2R559
[09:12:59] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #947 by antishok (16h 5m ago): Draggable: Set explicit width/height instead of right/bottom css. Fixes #7772 - ...
[09:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> I thought you couldn't determine if an element was positioned from the right or left.
[09:21:25] <shoky> hey scott_gonzalez, i don't know about failing in some browsers (i tested with chrome, FF, and IE9 and its ie7/ie8 modes), but i realized it'll fail with jquery core <1.8 ,  which is a bad thing right? :)
[09:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> shoky: Yeah, we need to support core back to 1.6.
[09:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> But of course, a fix that improves some combinations while not regressing others is better than what we have.
[09:24:05] <shoky> hmm well i think/hope the fix does do that, but the test i added would fail with <1.8 i think

[10:01:36] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez yes, it'll fail in FF, future chrome: 
[10:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> So is there anything we can do here or is this just a cantfix?
[10:02:41] <scott_gonzalez> shoky said he tested in Firefox.
[10:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, but I guess "fail" = always apply, right?
[10:03:05] <mikesherov> well, he tests THAT in FF
[10:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> So the unit test is going to pass.
[10:03:14] <mikesherov> it works just fine for specified 0px 0px
[10:03:26] <mikesherov> but not for something like 5px or so
[10:03:37] <mikesherov> petro: https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery-ui/compare/clip
[10:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: What's the difference between clip and clip3?
[10:04:30] <mikesherov> I got rid of clip3
[10:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> oh, heh, I *just* looked like half an hour ago :-P
[10:13:39] <shoky> hey mikesherov. can you please explain why it should fail in FF & future chrome?
[10:13:48] <mikesherov> shoky: one sec
[10:13:57] <shoky> sure
[10:14:03] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I'm code reviewing with petro too right now
[10:37:19] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so we're discussing the effects rewrite
[10:37:21] <mikesherov> got a sec?
[10:37:36] <mikesherov> shoky: the reason it'll fail is...
[10:38:08] <mikesherov> what if the right is set to 5px?
[10:38:15] <mikesherov> why would you reset it to auto?
[10:38:22] <mikesherov> that'll move the element
[10:39:44] <shoky> mikesherov: but draggable is setting its' "left" anyway
[10:40:16] <shoky> combined with the explicit width, why should it move?
[10:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Sure, what's up?
[10:42:36] <mikesherov> shoky: sure, that's if start doesn't stop it
[10:42:58] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: we're talking about whether placeholder should also be animated
[10:43:09] <mikesherov> to allow for collapsing containers
[10:43:24] <mikesherov> which is actually kind of silly :-\
[10:43:33] <mikesherov> But works
[10:43:47] <mikesherov> and right now, this is treated inconsistently
[10:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> Animating the placeholder seems like a lot of extra logic.
[10:44:50] <shoky> mikesherov: ok i hadn't thought of that case, but isn't that easily solvable?
[10:45:02] <mikesherov> sure
[10:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> It's a different animation than the actual effect animation, right?
[10:45:14] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yes, it's a lot
[10:45:28] <mikesherov> shoky: we need more test cases then what you've provided
[10:45:30] <mikesherov> it's a good start
[10:45:41] <mikesherov> but I want to make sure we have our bases covered
[10:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Do you have an example of what's broken without the placeholder animation?
[10:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> I thought we looked at an example the other week and got it working.
[10:47:18] <mikesherov> http://view.jqueryui.com/demos/effect/default.html
[10:47:23] <shoky> mikesherov: gotcha. thanks!
[10:47:42] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: nope
[10:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: We took that page and put a background on the parent.
[10:48:29] <scott_gonzalez> And the parent wasn't collapsing.
[10:48:32] <mikesherov> right
[10:48:35] <scott_gonzalez> Then we made some changes and got it to collapse.
[10:48:39] <scott_gonzalez> Or maybe we didn't.
[10:48:41] <mikesherov> no
[10:48:48] <scott_gonzalez> And I just poitned out that itw as a problem and you wrote it down.
[10:48:48] <mikesherov> blind & fold are "inline", scale, shake, and slide aren't!
[10:49:00] <mikesherov> the problem here is two fold
[10:49:15] <mikesherov> 1: the current implementation is inconsistent here
[10:49:25] <mikesherov> 2. the new implementation is consistently wrong :-)
[10:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[10:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: BTW, you didn't delete clip3
[10:50:49] <mikesherov> I didn't
[10:51:01] <mikesherov> not on origin
[10:51:02] <mikesherov> locally
[10:52:43] <mikesherov> so anyway‚Ä¶. there seems to be 5 animations that should effect the container
[10:54:20] <mikesherov> blind, clip, fold, puff, scale, size?
[10:54:26] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[10:57:46] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Do the animations for placeholder end up being simple enough that we can just implement inside the step callback?
[10:58:05] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so, yes
[10:58:47] <scott_gonzalez> Let's try that and see what we end up with.
[10:59:07] <mikesherov> Definitely
[10:59:15] <mikesherov> just let me know which ones should do this
[10:59:31] <mikesherov> which effects do expect to effect the container
[11:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> Your list looks good, but I'm not sure about puff.
[11:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> And like you, I'm on the fence about size.
[11:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> puff seems like explode to me.
[11:04:11] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i would +1 your idea for default cancel on draggable set to null and always cancel form controls
[11:05:05] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: puff, scale, and size are all the same thing really
[11:05:26] <mikesherov> but I can change that
[11:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> So let's do blind, clip, fold
[11:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can decide about puff, scale, size.
[11:06:11] <mikesherov> K
