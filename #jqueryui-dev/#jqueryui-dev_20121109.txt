[03:17:00] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I've delinted the DB files. But, I dont get some of the complains!
[03:17:01] <rxaviers> https://github.com/rxaviers/ui-download-builder/compare/lint
[03:17:11] <rxaviers> one of those:
[03:17:16] <rxaviers> -        if ( file.data == undefined ) {//null or undefined
[03:17:22] <rxaviers> +        if ( file.data === undefined || file.data === null ) {
[03:17:34] <rxaviers> Above I was using == to compare both null or undefined
[03:17:39] <rxaviers> but lint complains
[03:17:51] <rxaviers> another one:
[03:17:52] <rxaviers> -    else if( image == "05_inset_soft.png" || image == "06_inset_hard.png" ){
[03:17:57] <rxaviers> +    else if( image === "05_inset_soft.png" || image === "06_inset_hard.png" ){
[03:18:08] <rxaviers> It complains I need to compare several strings with ===
[03:18:18] <rxaviers> but, what's the pitfall using ==?
[03:18:20] <rxaviers> in this case
[03:24:51] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you should compare to == null, then set `eqnull: true`
[03:25:44] <jzaefferer> for the string comparisions: seems fine to just use === there
[03:26:41] <rxaviers> ah! and guess what, grunt.js has `eqnull: true` already ..
[03:26:49] <rxaviers> ok then
[03:27:12] <rxaviers> will fix the == null then

[03:36:55] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Im trying to debug the CI trouble.. In a separate branch, I'm using my own grunt with stderr fixed. The CI build should be showing the error by now. But, it still does not.
[03:37:17] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, is it possible for me to ssh to the machine and run the command there. It will help track it quicker

[03:41:23] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you could ask in #jquery-infrastructure
[03:41:34] <rxaviers> great! will do that thks

[05:36:26] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #777: SUCCESS in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/777/
[05:36:26] <doesallmagic> Scott Gonz√°lez: CSS: Update .ui-helper-hidden-accessible to match H5BP's current .visuallyhidden. Fixes #8793 - Dialog: Internal autocomplete causes scroll bars.
[05:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: The panels that are hidden stay hidden on destroy.
[05:39:08] <scott_gonzalez> This is probably because there used to be .ui-tabs-hide and destroy() just removed all the classes.
[05:39:13] <scott_gonzalez> Now we actually .show()/.hide().
[05:40:14] <petersendidit> And domEqual() doesn't catch these type of things
[05:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[05:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'll add "style" to the list of attributes and see what else is failing.
[05:46:25] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...that doesn't seem like it'll work.
[05:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> Adding a check for the style attribute resules in before = "", after = "display: block;"
[05:47:38] <scott_gonzalez> Which is the correct behavior, but fails the test.
[05:50:55] <mikesherov> hi
[05:51:42] <mikesherov> doing some retriage.. this sounds like a wontfix, because it requires the iframe shim which I don't think we want to perpetuate in dialog: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6882
[05:51:48] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: thoughts? ^
[05:52:30] <mikesherov> ?6882
[05:52:32] <bot-t> [#6882] BUG in IE (bug : 1.4.1) - http://jqbug.com/6882
[05:52:42] <scott_gonzalez> So applying .bgiframe() (if it didn't have a browser sniff) would fix that?
[05:52:54] <mikesherov> From my research, yes
[05:53:09] <mikesherov> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/638886/java-applet-z-index-problem-safari-and-beyond
[05:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with closing as wontfix.
[05:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> Who's using applets anyway? :-P
[05:53:29] <mikesherov> seriously
[05:53:32] <mikesherov> so is .bgiframe() externally exposed?
[05:53:43] <mikesherov> I can tell the OP to use that
[05:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's a plugin by Brandon Aaron, not part of UI.
[05:54:36] <scott_gonzalez> But we used to do: if ( $.fn.bgiframe ) { elem.bgiframe(); }
[05:54:46] <scott_gonzalez> Whenever we had "floating" content.
[05:54:53] <scott_gonzalez> But that's completely gone in master.
[05:54:58] <scott_gonzalez> And bgiframe sniffs for IE6.
[05:55:52] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like you could just do: <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: -1;"></iframe>
[05:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> Anda ppend tot he dialog.
[05:56:01] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] rxaviers created versions (+1 new commit): http://git.io/7OjVGg
[05:56:01] <jquicommit> download.jqueryui.com/versions 0e7aec9 Rafael Xavier de Souza: Grunt builds all jqueryUi refs of config.json...
[05:56:32] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yes, you can
[05:56:40] <mikesherov> the question is, should we?
[05:57:32] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, gnarf, The first commit for supporting multiple versions. The above allows you to `grunt prepare` the  jqueryUi versions from config.json file. Actually, not only versions, but a ref = tag/branch.
[05:57:34] <rxaviers>     - Supported refs in config.json are:
[05:57:34] <rxaviers>       . a string, if a single entry. Eg. "jqueryUi": "1.9.1";
[05:57:34] <rxaviers>       . an array, if multiple refs. Eg. "jqueryUi": [ "master", "1.9.1" ];
[05:57:48] <mikesherov> rxaviers: cool!
[05:58:19] <rxaviers> still needs a lot more changes.. but it's a start :)
[05:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> So this guy reported it 2 years ago and there are 0 comments on the ticket.
[05:58:38] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't seem worth fixing.
[05:59:13] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, that took 1.46 hours vs 4h planned. :)
[05:59:38] * rxaviers going to have lunch
[05:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Can we have jqueryUi and jqueryUiLegacy instead of an array?
[05:59:46] <tj_vantoll> petersendidit The tabs bug makes sense to me after seeing your test case.  Not sure why that one confused me, thanks.
[05:59:47] <scott_gonzalez> The config is used by other repos too.
[06:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/818#issuecomment-10227325
[06:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> That reverts 3 fixes.
[06:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8792#comment:2
[06:09:22] <mikesherov> oh
[06:09:41] <mikesherov> because the pull that fixed 3 things didnt have tests
[06:10:02] <mikesherov> in the meantime, here's an awesome pull: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/814
[06:10:23] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: fixes 3 bugs explicitly, with tests, and 2 more inadvertantly, with tests forthcoming
[06:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this guy seems good.
[06:11:46] <scott_gonzalez> I guess he likes testing: https://github.com/eromba/JsTestDriver-Android-Init
[06:12:11] <mikesherov> Anyone we want to encourage should be in love with tests
[06:12:12] <mikesherov> :-)
[06:12:27] <mikesherov> Especially around the interaction stuff, because the tests are whats super important there
[06:13:04] <mikesherov> So I just wanted to make sure we're interested in landing that PR when he updates because I don't want to encourage someone and then we say wontfix
[06:13:12] <mikesherov> I got in trouble with that once before
[06:14:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the changes look good.
[06:15:01] <scott_gonzalez> Let me find the old PR.
[06:15:48] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/695
[06:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/694#discussion_r1171399
[06:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> He can go back to $.isEmptyObject() if he wants, since we're not longer worried about 1-8-stable.
[06:17:39] <mikesherov> well, which approach is better?
[06:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> I think either is fine.
[06:18:28] <mikesherov> Let's land as is for now, considering the rewrite anyway
[06:18:42] <mikesherov> I'd like to wait for his response on the additional tests though
[06:18:43] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:18:59] <mikesherov> if this fixes 5 bugs, there should be tests for 5 bugs :-)
[06:19:25] <mikesherov> but his other pull can land‚Ä¶ did he sign CLA yet?
[06:19:45] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/815/files
[06:20:43] <mikesherov> yeah, he has, he's line 54 on the google doc :-)
[06:29:03] <scott_gonzalez> BAM! Check your email :-)
[06:32:16] <mikesherov> Woah
[06:32:17] <mikesherov> :-)
[06:32:28] <mikesherov> Thanks scott_gonzalez
[06:32:36] <mikesherov> is this because I'm annoying you, LOL?
[06:32:48] <mikesherov> And it's my birthday, so thanks for the bday present
[06:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, happy birthday.
[06:33:04] <mikesherov> thanks!
[06:38:09] <mikesherov> so, scott_gonzalez just one thing before I land my first pull‚Ä¶ you guys do it differently than core, right? Is there documentation somewhere?
[06:38:48] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40154555/Pull%20Requests
[06:38:55] <scott_gonzalez> We try to avoid merge commits.
[06:39:10] <scott_gonzalez> If you search for "fetch and cherry-pick", that's the process I use.
[06:47:25] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: and if I need to squash, just use the same process‚Ä¶ you guys prefer "thanks‚Ä¶ landed in" over "close gh-"?
[06:48:59] <rxaviers> mikesherov, ah! Happy birthday!! Wish you a great day
[06:49:07] <mikesherov> thanks!
[06:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you can squash however you want, multiple `cherry-pick -n`s `merge --squash`, `rebase -i`, etc.
[06:50:02] <mikesherov> got it
[06:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> We use our commit messages to generate our changelog.
[06:50:19] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what's the difference between jqueryUi and jqueryUiLegacy?
[06:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> We could add "close gh-..." and just have that get ripped out during the changelog generation.
[06:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: 1.10.0 and 1.9.2.
[06:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: See http://old.jqueryui.com/download
[06:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to document the version support for each as well.
[06:52:34] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: one last question‚Ä¶ I don't need to worry about porting to stable too?
[06:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> Not right now. 1-9-stable is a bit out of sync.
[06:53:25] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] mikesherov pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Xc7U5Q
[06:53:25] <jquicommit> jquery-ui/master 6e0a055 Ethan Romba: Resizable: Grid now respects min/max dimensions. Fixed #8435 - grid does not respect min/max dimensions
[06:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> Normally they'd be in-sync and we'd `cherry-pick -x` right away.
[06:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> But, interaction fixes are likely to fail a cherry-pick anyway.
[06:54:06] <rxaviers> ah! hard code two versions
[06:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> Unless we copy over all of the test changes and cleanup.
[06:54:31] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: sure. I mean in the general case‚Ä¶ do I backport usually?
[06:54:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, generally what I do is cherry-pick -x and if it works, I push, if it doesn't I just skip it.
[06:55:01] <mikesherov> k
[06:55:22] <mikesherov> I need to coordinate with Dave Stein because I want to port all of the tests over to interactions branch
[06:55:34] <mikesherov> that's the main thing I'm after there.
[06:56:58] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell Dave_Stein I want to coordinate porting the test suite over to the new interactions branch because I'm landing pulls
[06:56:59] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[06:59:06] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: sorry for being so annoying, but with my new found power, I want to start closing stale pulls‚Ä¶ just want to go over 1 or 2 with you to make sure we're on the same page
[06:59:17] <scott_gonzalez> No problem :-)
[06:59:25] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/718 close this one?
[06:59:58] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, having two vars makes it more rigid in case for some-reason we come up having three downloadable versions. I assume we'd have something lile:
[07:00:00] <mikesherov> My thought is, it's a new option on interactions, which is the wrong direction. We want to remove options, not add them, and it's pretty superfluous
[07:00:12] <rxaviers> 	"jqueryUi": "1.10.0",
[07:00:13] <rxaviers> 	"jqueryUiLegacy": "1.9.1",
[07:00:13] <rxaviers> 	"jqueryUiDesc": "Stable, for jQuery 1.x.x+",
[07:00:13] <rxaviers> 	"jqueryUiLegacyDesc": "Legacy release, for jQuery 1.3.2",
[07:00:13] <rxaviers> (well, we can even omit "Stabe" or "Legacy" names from above, since we know it)
[07:00:14] <rxaviers> Another option would be:
[07:00:17] <rxaviers> 	"jqueryUi": [ "1.10.0", "1.9.1" ],
[07:00:18] <rxaviers> 	"jqueryUiDescs": {
[07:00:20] <rxaviers> 		"1.10.0": "Stable, for jQuery 1.x.x+",
[07:00:22] <rxaviers> 		"1.9.1": "Legacy release, for jQuery 1.3.2"
[07:00:24] <rxaviers> 	}
[07:00:26] <rxaviers> And eventually having a different numbers of downloadable versions, we simply add one more.
[07:01:51] <rxaviers> Or somethine like:
[07:01:51] <rxaviers> 	"jqueryUi": [{
[07:01:51] <rxaviers> 		ref: "1.10.0",
[07:01:51] <rxaviers> 		desc: "Stable, for jQuery 1.x.x+",
[07:01:51] <rxaviers> 	}, ...]
[07:01:55] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what u think?
[07:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> I think the last one is fine, but we'd need to add a flag saying which one is stable.
[07:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, we can just assume jqueryUI[0] is stable.
[07:03:30] <rxaviers> why do we need to know which one is stable? To be the default?
[07:03:41] <rxaviers> or something else?
[07:04:01] <scott_gonzalez> To be the default, and because this controls jqueryui.com.

[07:34:02] <rxaviers> jqueryui.com is hijacking download.jqueryui.com tmp files
[07:34:27] <mikesherov> thanks jzaefferer
[07:34:51] <rxaviers> so far, not a trouble, because we're only building one ref. So, the tmp is always fresh. But, now it's not guaranteed that tmp files will have the stable/default checkout.
[07:35:24] <rxaviers> (and it should not guarantee anyway, it's tmp files)
[07:35:51] <rxaviers> It seems we'll need to handle that inside of jqueryui.com
[07:47:08] <gnarf> kborchers: you forgot to file a bug on http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-content  ;)

[08:05:24] <mikesherov> I would think the box-model stuff I did in core 1.8 would address the issue‚Ä¶ no?
[08:08:22] <mikesherov> actually, ignore me
[08:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yeah, we're hijacking the checkout to avoid cloning the repo yet again.
[08:21:37] <scott_gonzalez> If we can find a clean way to ensure we're getting the version we wnat, that'd be ideal.
[08:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Are the current rules actually failing?
[08:24:26] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: IE8 opactiy: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/cross-browser-opacity/
[08:26:53] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I understand, but copying the files from DB tmp dir will be problematic.. Right now I dont see any other clean way of doing this, but handling it by its own, ie. checking jquery-ui out to a tmp dir and copying the demo files from it. I can help implementing it
[08:27:54] <tj_vantoll> mikesherov I did some research on this one and I couldn't find any situation where not including that actually caused a problem in IE8 (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7394#comment:5).  That being said I don't really see any harm in adding it.
[08:28:39] <mikesherov> well, that's a different story tj_vantoll
[08:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Ok, can you file an issue against jqueryui.com? We were just trying to save time/bytes, but it's definitely a hack.
[08:30:09] <rxaviers> sure
[08:31:52] <mikesherov> so tj_vantoll, doesn't the IE7 opacity not work in IE8?
[08:36:20] <tj_vantoll> This shows everywhere that opacity is used in jQuery UI - http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/CFgDL/show/.  Open it in IE8 and everything appears to look opaque as intended.  Not that I trust IE8's dev tools, but it shows IE7's filter: Alpha(Opacity=35); applied.  If I change Alpha(Opacity=35) to something like Alpha(Opacity=100) via the dev tools the change takes.
[08:37:18] <tj_vantoll> That being said I know I've seen times where -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=35)" is needed.  I don't really have a logical explanation for that.

[08:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> yeah

[08:59:01] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: // there are some rounding errors in FF, Chrome, and IE9, so we can't say equal, we have to settle for close enough
[08:59:01] <mikesherov> 		ok( offsetAfter.left - offsetBefore.left - 50 <= 1 && offsetAfter.top - offsetBefore.top - 50 <= 1, "dragged[50, 50] " + "&lt;" + typeName + "&gt;" );
[08:59:02] <mikesherov> 		
[08:59:07] <mikesherov> That's what I did in draggable
[08:59:27] <mikesherov> we should create an equalEnough() method :-P
[08:59:48] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[08:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> I hate subpixels.
[08:59:57] <mikesherov> it's so dumb
[09:00:07] <mikesherov> it's like the invention of the quark
[09:00:24] <mikesherov> like, a pixel is the unit of measure
[09:00:27] <mikesherov> end of story
[09:00:43] <scott_gonzalez> for realz
[09:00:50] <mikesherov> used value vs. actual value
[09:00:59] <mikesherov> browsers should be returning USED value
[09:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> agreed
[09:01:45] <mikesherov> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/actual_value
[09:01:55] <mikesherov> I don't give a shit about the actual value
[09:02:13] <mikesherov> anyways, need a "goodEnough" method
[09:02:19] <mikesherov> until we can sanely deal with it
[09:02:27] <mikesherov> put it in testinit
[09:02:56] <jzaefferer> mikesherov scott_gonzalez: there's actually a close/notClose addon in QUnit: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/tree/master/addons/close-enough
[09:03:14] <mikesherov> there you go
[09:03:23] <jzaefferer> we can just copy the methods from here: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/addons/close-enough/qunit-close-enough.js
[09:03:25] <mikesherov> if it exists, someone needed it :-)
[09:04:01] <mikesherov> to measure PI apparently. Delicious pi
[09:04:44] <jzaefferer> half pi!
[09:05:06] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: where do you deal with that in the draggable testsuite?
[09:05:31] <mikesherov> draggable_core.js line 28
[09:10:37] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: what do you think? Can I close all the pulls that don't have tests for interactions? A lot of them are old and unlikely to get updated? My message will be basically "we're closing pulls that can't be merged as is‚Ä¶ we like the pull, but it needs tests so feel free to open a new one with tests and we'll land it."
[09:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:15:41] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: are you fixing those subpixel tests?
[09:16:07] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: I'm working on dialog
[09:16:31] <jzaefferer> I need that fixed before writing any new or modifying tests...
[09:17:39] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: I can fix the fails now.
[09:18:04] <mikesherov> do you guys want me to clean all the tests up so that they all run always
[09:18:13] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: a patch would be welcome, don't push any commits; I'm working on the dialog-review branch right now, which needs to be rebased anyway
[09:18:17] <mikesherov> I had only done the interactions stuff, but I can finish that up now
[09:18:34] <jzaefferer> and yeah, generally getting all testsuites in order would certainly help
[09:18:49] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: I'll issue a PR against your branch
[09:19:12] <mikesherov> and then I'll get datepicker passing
[09:19:13] <jzaefferer> or that, okay
[09:19:26] <jzaefferer> I guess I just need the commit to cherry-pick it anyway
[09:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> Does this look good to commit?

[10:30:55] <scott_gonzalez> You just want to push to dialog-review again? That seems fine.
[10:31:05] <mikesherov> well, it's a rebase push
[10:31:08] <mikesherov> so it changes history
[10:31:26] <mikesherov> or should I have merged master into it instead?
[10:32:09] <mikesherov> btw, I'm of the opinion that we should never ignore a component when we do a refactor, even if it's one that we're rewriting
[10:32:23] <mikesherov> jzaefferer said "We'll ignore datepicker and interactions for now, as those are being rewritten. Everything else is addressed."

[10:39:44] <mikesherov> people are crazy
[10:39:55] <mikesherov> open source is silly
[10:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> I asked months ago why Anvil was better than grunt and never got an answer.
[10:48:59] <mikesherov> and the optics are just bad
[10:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> I can't even tell what's going on with some of the stuff in build.json.
[10:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> What's output?
[10:49:31] <mikesherov> there is no reason to introduce competing products when communities are tightly integrated
[10:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> What's anvil.token?
[10:49:44] <scott_gonzalez> right
[10:49:54] <mikesherov> I understand the desire, but it's just not necessary
[10:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> And anvil was very very young when we started using grunt in jQuery.
[10:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> So it's not even like it was a more mature project.
[10:51:25] <mikesherov> I just feel like appendTo and bocoup should never introduce competing projects
[10:51:39] <mikesherov> too many from both companies on the team
[10:51:42] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I didn't even think about that.
[10:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> I associate the projects with the individual maintainers.
[10:52:03] <mikesherov> I do to, but it's hard to not see that part of it
[10:52:24] <scott_gonzalez> But that's a really good point. appendTo and Bocoup should find common ground to collaborate on.
[10:58:35] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, anvil is actually an appendTo project now.
[10:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> Seems silly to compete with grunt.
[11:00:01] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Before I dig into this, do you know if this is just legacy code? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.effect.js#L711

[12:12:10] <Dave_Stein> I've been looking here: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137878/Draggable
[12:12:26] <Dave_Stein> although I had finished those things and just verified they are still working today now that interactions finally got a pull frmo jquery master and im back on the project
[12:12:48] <mikesherov> https://docs.google.com/document/d/11XFeB_WSh-bynToPwWy9_JHsMHNFxaPYKv20p_sm2Eg/edit
[12:12:51] <Dave_Stein> so everything still works that i did for draggable and droppable and i was figuring out how i wanted to make sortable just now when i hopped in here with that obscure "bug"
[12:13:31] <Dave_Stein> and you still gotta give me permission for that doc
[12:13:55] <mikesherov> shared
[12:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Do you know why it breaks? Is it in interaction or in draggable?
[12:14:27] <Dave_Stein> okay cool i see that's a lot more detail :)
[12:14:30] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: can you catch me up? I understand you didn't come here to discuss this, but I just want to get on the same page
[12:14:54] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: scott and I pretty much were just getting the most basic functionality possible done for each interaction without going into too much depth
[12:15:04] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: if you look at draggable and droppable now itsl ike 3 options each
[12:15:33] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: draggable doesn't have the power to call interactionStop() off the bat so I think it's in interaction...
[12:15:38] <mikesherov> So, are we going wide first, and then filling each of them out? or is it that the plan for draggable and droppable to release with 3 options?
[12:15:57] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: basically if i destroy an interaction widget it needs to make sure that it calls that function
[12:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> To figure out the new API, you need to start from the old API and then make the changes listed in that doc.
[12:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> I can work on the forum post announcing the API changes so that we can finalize the new API.
[12:16:40] <Dave_Stein> I didn't think we'd release with 3, but go wide first to make sure the base interaction works well with all the interactions
[12:16:52] <mikesherov> base interaction?
[12:16:55] <scott_gonzalez> But I wanted to figure out how we're handling things like distance and duration and touch scrolling and the like first.
[12:17:03] <Dave_Stein> otherwise we can complete draggable 100% before going to any other interaction and not knowing full-well how flexible interaction.js is- or any of the other required files
[12:17:19] <Dave_Stein> yeah interaction.js and the new way we are handling touchl ike scott said
[12:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/ui/jquery.ui.interaction.js (which can use some tests of its own)
[12:17:40] <Dave_Stein> personally, I'm fine with either approach as long as we are on same page
[12:18:27] <mikesherov> right, so the thought is, build them all out narrow and wide
[12:18:52] <mikesherov> to get at what's really shared for interaction.js which is like "core" for all interactions
[12:18:58] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[12:19:08] <Dave_Stein> and then when we're happy with core we start filling out each interaction
[12:19:11] <mikesherov> shallow and wide*
[12:19:18] <mikesherov> I see...
[12:19:32] <mikesherov> That's a good approach
[12:19:40] <mikesherov> I usually take a bit of a different angle on it
[12:19:58] <Dave_Stein> i think the other approach is what hurt sortable the most in current UI
[12:19:59] <mikesherov> I get feature parity first with tests...
[12:20:12] <mikesherov> well, I'm with you on cutting options
[12:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> The final API isn't changing based on order of implementation.
[12:20:51] <Dave_Stein> correct
[12:21:13] <Dave_Stein> but making sure interactions mesh well first is the most important, at least to me - it's why i started working on this in first place :)
[12:21:13] <mikesherov> Right, sure, but I feel like there's enough shared functionality, that you'll get most of the core interaction.js stuff done by filling out one of the interactions deeply
[12:21:16] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #786: STILL FAILING in 9 min 25 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/786/
[12:21:16] <doesallmagic> mike.sherov: Dev: clean up dialog test suite with new helper methods. Fixes #8803 - Dev: re-enable the dialog test suite
[12:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> My plan was to work on them one at a time in this order: draggable, droppable, resizable, sortable, selectable.
[12:21:30] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't care what order they're actually worked on.
[12:21:44] <scott_gonzalez> That's just the order I was going to do them if I had to implement the whole thing.
[12:21:52] <Dave_Stein> oh man i'll be happy to rerewirte resizable - it's still weird for me if i want to maintain aspect ratio
[12:22:03] <Dave_Stein> i was just doing draggable droppable sortable because i know i had the biggest headaches trying to get all 3 to play nice
[12:22:06] <Dave_Stein> in current UI
[12:22:10] <mikesherov> sure
[12:22:39] <mikesherov> but I mean, my thought would be "let's figure out what the releasable state for 1 of these things is first"
[12:22:49] <mikesherov> to at least get a stake in the ground‚Ä¶ you know?
[12:23:15] <mikesherov> I'm fine with each approach. I just wanted to share my thought process on it
[12:23:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'll work on getting the actual API written down.
[12:23:56] <mikesherov> that's a great idea scott_gonzalez, because I don't even know what "in favor of some other way to restrict movement" is
[12:24:18] <mikesherov> and that's what a lot of the options removal stuff references
[12:24:20] <scott_gonzalez> You can modify ui.position.left/top inside the drag callback.
[12:24:31] <Dave_Stein> haha
[12:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/demos/draggable/constrain-movement.html#L24
[12:24:53] <Dave_Stein> yeah that works so you can say if ui.position.left > 500 then preventDefault
[12:24:55] <Dave_Stein> and it won't move anymore
[12:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> gotta go
[12:25:45] <Dave_Stein> and I know we did some work already to automate the way scrolling works based on duration and distance for dragging over a scrollbar
[12:26:09] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: okay... we can talk about the stop thing later... whether I should call it in my destroy or put it in the interaction destroy
[12:26:39] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: I'm gonna take this minute to duck out quick and get a coffee before this girl finishes taking her test for interview :D I'll be back in 20
[12:26:52] <mikesherov> k, I'll leave a comment here for posterity
[12:27:03] <mikesherov> one thing we should do is write the upgrade guide first
[12:27:18] <mikesherov> as a utility for ourselves to write the tests with
[12:27:52] <mikesherov> I'm going to transform the current tests with their zillions of options, into the corresponding way to do it without the option!
[12:46:41] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: well just let me know when you want me to do what :) Obviously if there's some functioning tests comitted I can figure out how to write some new ones. Nothing beats good example code + knowing there are docs for qunit
[12:46:59] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: but if you want to attempt to convert the unit tests to failing until my code makes them not fail - i'm pretty okay with that too ha
[12:47:29] <mikesherov> Well, that's why I really want to get an "upgrade guide" written for one first
[12:47:39] <mikesherov> so you can focus on getting the code there
[12:47:46] <mikesherov> and I can focus on getting the tests there
[12:47:59] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: to that point it's good i'm doing minimal things on each plugin before the entire API is set
[12:48:08] <mikesherov> yeah
[12:48:10] <mikesherov> agreed
[12:48:13] <Dave_Stein> cool
[12:48:32] <Dave_Stein> now i have to go write some migration scripts to fix bad data in my database - the more stressful part of the day for me lol

[13:29:03] <nacin> yeah, I saw the todo. we weren't using it, though.
[13:29:34] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: when I finish slider, there is no more need for all-active anymore!

[13:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: :-)
[13:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I'll look into this right now.
[13:30:38] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: sweet. I'm not familiar with widgets, but something feels off, for sure.
[13:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: So this is broken in master only?
[13:31:29] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yes. even worked with 1.9.0 I think (confirming now)
[13:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:32:10] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I changed the code for 1.9.1, so that would make sense.
[13:32:14] <nacin> yeah.
[13:32:19] <scott_gonzalez> I came very close to just closign that ticket as wontfix :-P
[13:34:21] <mikesherov> oops, broke Opera 11.6
[13:34:26] <mikesherov> fixing now
[13:38:53] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I see what's going on. This is a pretty bad regression.
[13:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: If you want a quick workaround, just add `widgetEventPrefix: "wpdialog" in the widget definition.
[13:42:53] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: thanks

[13:50:23] <nacin> you guys have one of the more interesting setups - using GitHub and PRs, but Trac.
[13:51:15] <nacin> a number of contributors use the github mirror, then git diff to submit. fairly simple.
[13:51:42] <nacin> we don't really like the idea of adopting a closed source, hosted, for-profit solution. that really curtails our control.

[14:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> Just added a comment listing the changes.
[14:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> Since you're already changing the default for that option in the base dialog, there's no need to redefine the option.

[14:21:42] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Wouldn't we be re-inventing the wheel for when dragging the items since draggable handles that already

[14:23:40] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: I agree to that, but I think that's possible by splitting up / extending over certain functions... I just don't think it makes sense to have drag logic in sortable and draggable
[14:23:55] <scott_gonzalez> git rm? :-P
[14:24:05] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: I know today in sortable each item is a fake draggable to some extent... it's very confusing that it gets some functionality of draggable but not others
[14:24:06] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it's referenced by anything.
[14:24:26] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: I don't remember specifics but it was the root of some bugs around using draggable/droppable/sortable together on same elements
[14:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> We'd need specific cases that were failing.

[14:26:40] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: What's the process for submitting patches that don't fix bugs or add features?
[14:27:29] <nacin> filing a ticket as an enhancement is typically all that is needed. I'll go ahead and commit what you sent to me in a gist, though.
[14:28:13] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is this format easier for you to work with? https://gist.github.com/4048730
[14:28:42] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: I guess some of hwat I'm thinking is going away since we will have actual refreshPositions methods.. unlike the current one where it needs to be faked when accessing ddmanager directly
[14:29:30] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yes, but `patch` simply asks you to specify a path if it can't find it, so ab-prefixed stuff is still easy to apply
[14:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[14:29:56] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: however the main question is why do we want to duplicate any dragging logic at all rather than depend on another interaction plugin? The events thing is good reason but fixable. Filesize comes to mind but how much would we save by keeping 100% separate?
[14:30:15] <scott_gonzalez> Likely a lot.
[14:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> But it's hard to say without having actual code.
[14:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'd prefer to build separately and then see what's duplicated.

[14:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: FWIW, you likely have more experience working with interaction plugins than I do :-P
[14:32:10] <Dave_Stein> haha
[14:33:36] <Dave_Stein> draggable is still bothering me as is... so much is done before "beforeStart" in order to allow the override of where it starts. worth any thought?
[14:34:02] <Dave_Stein> Even if I fold code into sortable plugin and don't use draggable I gotta think about when to calculate positions
[14:34:27] <mikesherov> ok, g2g guys, but good news‚Ä¶. all tests are running, and all files are linting!
[14:34:30] <Dave_Stein> Namely that my sortable item isn't position absolute until I drag it and the way we currently ahve draggable setup is in a way that we can't change something to absolute after sort
[14:34:34] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: see ya later
[14:35:34] <Dave_Stein> because we actually do a lot of calculations before beforeStart which is kinda ironic :)
[14:35:46] <Dave_Stein> do you think that's worth revisiting?
[14:37:32] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: ^^ my last thoughts of the evening
[14:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Isn't all of that required before the beforeStart event since beforeStart exists for moving?
[14:42:21] <Dave_Stein> Dave_Stein: Correct.. but it only happens a few lines before dragstart. There's no way to prevent drag without doing lots of position checking even if user doesn't care for that to stop drag
[14:42:41] <Dave_Stein> god the language is confusing here... beforedragstart first a few lines before dragstart
[14:43:30] <Dave_Stein> so the event doesn't give as much bang as it could if we didn't want the ability to change start position... i'm really just thinking out loud
[14:44:14] <scott_gonzalez> Are you asking whether we can get rid of the event or if we can change the order of the code?
[14:44:44] <Dave_Stein> change the order of the code so beforestart is actually before anything kicks off. but we can't do that while wanting the other feature same time
[14:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> Right, well that's the only reason beforeStart even exists.
[14:45:26] <Dave_Stein> if user can change position of draggable on drag, there's no reason to give them that ability on beforedragstart since if they only want to do it once, they can track that first instance themselves
[14:45:42] <Dave_Stein> it's half the reason -> the other reason is to prevent drag from firing
[14:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> No, it's the only reason.
[14:46:09] <scott_gonzalez> Preventing dragStart would prevent drag from happening.
[14:47:00] <Dave_Stein> i mean preventing default in beforeStart keeps anything from happening at all
[14:47:21] <Dave_Stein> preventing dfeault in drag itself will stop the drag but not until a bunch of operations are already run
[14:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> Right, but if beforeStart didn't exist, the same would be true of start.
[14:47:48] <scott_gonzalez> Which was the original design.
[14:48:35] <Dave_Stein> i think from a user standpoint the main reason for beforestart would be to prevent anything from happening if they dont want it to. if beforestart only exists from our persepctive to change position... it should stick to having that in start rather than beforestart
[14:49:00] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: I don't think you realize how painful it is to change the start position if you do that.
[14:49:13] <scott_gonzalez> Do `git checkout 87c55b69e43085c869d5c0577db72dcdbbe1af1e`
[14:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> And look at the default draggable demo.
[14:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> Now try to implement that without beforestart.
[14:50:11] <Dave_Stein> okay i'll note that down to look when i go to code again because I'm guessing if you have that offhand it's a real good reason :)
[14:50:44] <Dave_Stein> real lifei s the best argument
[14:51:15] <scott_gonzalez> So the problem is that if you want to change the start position, for things like cursorAt.
[14:51:27] <scott_gonzalez> You want to do that once and then have all future events make sense.
[14:51:40] <scott_gonzalez> You don't want to try to compensate for cursorAt in every single drag event.
[14:51:57] <Dave_Stein> aren't we removing cursorAt? although me asking that is probably a point for your side of debat
[14:52:11] <Dave_Stein> cause without that i'm guessing it's even ahrder to do that start position change
[14:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:53:05] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: okay I'm satisfied.. i'll get to making sortable next week most likely... at least I have a good idea how to make it after my pastebin
[14:53:19] <scott_gonzalez> Awesome, looking forward to it.
[14:53:26] <Dave_Stein> me too!
