[05:19:49] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez #4303 covers ui.item referring to the source element.  I choose to close #4253 because it had "ui.item is null" in the title.  If they are the same thing #4303 should be marked as a duplicate, but #4303 has a much better title.
[05:19:49] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: You have 1 new message (and 1 unread), use `read when you wish to read it.
[05:19:55] <tj_vantoll> read
[05:19:59] <tj_vantoll> `read
[05:19:59] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: From scott_gonzalez, 1mon 1w ago: I gave you commit access on pretty much all things UI. Should make it easier for content updates.
[05:20:04] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: From scott_gonzalez, 8h 36m ago: that sortable bug I reponed looks like a duplicate of http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4303
[05:20:48] <tj_vantoll> And apparently you already know that.
[05:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I don't care which one stays open. I only saw the other after reopining the first.
[05:21:12] <tj_vantoll> Ok, I'm going to re-close #4253 as a duplicate then.
[05:21:12] <scott_gonzalez> So feel free to reclose as duplicate.
[05:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[05:21:18] <tj_vantoll> :)
[05:21:37] <Ekaitz> Hi this channel is only dev things
[05:21:50] <Ekaitz> or it is possible to do queries...
[05:23:11] <tj_vantoll> Ekaitz dev only, support is in #jquery
[05:24:04] <Ekaitz> thank you 
[05:32:46] <scott_gonzalez> FUCK. Why is the Internet full of drama?
[05:37:35] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I'm not seeing this portlet bug.
[05:37:58] <tj_vantoll> On the demo?
[05:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm supposed to drag Links below News, right?
[05:38:01] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:38:18] <tj_vantoll> Resize your browser so that the iframe is < 500 some odd pixels then do it.
[05:38:48] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see..
[05:39:00] <tj_vantoll> There's 3 floating 170px columns.
[05:39:18] <tj_vantoll> When they run out of space the third column falls underneath the 2nd.
[05:40:31] <scott_gonzalez> Let me just make sure this will work when the demos get processed for jqueryui.com.
[05:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, this works, go ahead and land it.
[05:43:19] <tj_vantoll> Will do, thanks.
[05:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I don't know why it wouldn't have worked.
[05:43:47] <scott_gonzalez> At first I was thinking the actual body was being modified and wasn't sure if it would be preserved in the build-demos task.
[05:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> But since it's just a style, it's obviously going to be preserved.
[05:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise our demos would be totally busted.
[07:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Are we meeting today?
[07:18:40] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: We could, but might as well skip. I'll have much more to report in two weeks.
[07:18:49] <jzaefferer> By then the TestSwarm projects refactor might be done, too
[07:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:31:17] <ngsilverman> scott_gonzalez: regarding Globalize, are we looking to only update the culture information, or also possibly the format of that information?
[07:31:37] <scott_gonzalez> We can change the format if there's something better.
[07:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> It's 0.x software, so we're still free to change it as we need.
[07:32:10] <ngsilverman> it's not so much something better as I think some information isn't really there in CLDR
[07:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[07:32:26] <scott_gonzalez> like what?
[07:32:53] <ngsilverman> for instance, when looking at numbers, we define a number group separator for regular numbers, for percents and for currency
[07:33:09] <ngsilverman> cldr just gives you one of those for a whole country
[07:33:26] <scott_gonzalez> Are there any cultures in Globalize that use a different separator right now?
[07:33:32] <ngsilverman> I'm not sure
[07:34:26] <ngsilverman> I'll need to code something to check that
[07:34:57] <ngsilverman> I wasn't able to find separators for dates and times either
[07:35:01] <ngsilverman> stuff like that
[07:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> I would think the date separator has to be there somewhere.
[07:35:50] <ngsilverman> they give like 4 different formats depending on the length you want
[07:36:06] <ngsilverman> depending on the format there may or may not be a separator like globalize defines it
[07:38:01] <jzaefferer> ngsilverman: in theorey, CLDR isn't static either and can be changed, though it will be much harder to get any changes in there
[07:39:06] <ngsilverman> yes, let's chance CLDR to our format! :P
[07:39:10] <ngsilverman> change*
[07:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so the separators are just built into the compound formats.
[07:39:32] <ngsilverman> yes
[07:39:53] <ngsilverman> globalize also has different format for dates and times
[07:39:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'd say look at datepicker to see what we're using right now.
[07:40:28] <ngsilverman> ok, so if there are some things we're not using, we could get rid of them?
[07:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:40:52] <ngsilverman> like the date separators, where the information is already somewhere else
[07:40:53] <ngsilverman> ok
[07:44:11] <gnarf> did rxaviers happen to mention if he'd be by today or not?
[07:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> Don't think so.
[08:12:18] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: thanks for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/5e1b8dc71a72d5753a95c49c844857b91fbdbade, was getting ready to report that. I have a separate question for 1.10.
[08:13:22] <nacin> also, easy for us to work around, but #8729 caused a bit of a problem for us.
[08:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, why?
[08:14:34] <nacin> resulted in http://cl.ly/Md0u
[08:14:51] <nacin> (we may have been doing it wrong, I haven't looked deeply)
[08:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...you're using our CSS or custom CSS?
[08:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, if all you need is a higher z-index, just set it on .ui-front.
[08:16:14] <scott_gonzalez> It uses 100 in our theme, but you can set it to whatever you want.
[08:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> We're just trying to get away from playing z-index games, because we usually lose.
[08:16:36] <nacin> I know the feeling.
[08:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> Now we're playing a different game of moving elements around in the DOM and we're losing at that game too :-(
[08:17:52] <scott_gonzalez> iframes reload, scroll positions get reset, etc.
[08:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> Stupid browsres.
[08:59:18] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: is there a timeline for 1.10.2? no rush, just curious.
[09:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Probably a week or two.
