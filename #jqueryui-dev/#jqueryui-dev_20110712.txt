[02:30:11] <ThiefMaster|work> hmm.. not sure if that's a datepicker bug or not.. but creating a datepicker on a div not attached to the document in chrome results in a zero-height datepicker

[20:38:50] <gnarf> danheberden: yt?
[20:47:03] <gnarf> hrm
[20:47:20] <gnarf> should toggleClass try to feature detect / set the css transition property? :)
[20:48:53] <gnarf> toggleClass might be as simple as set the transition property to all /duration and then call toggleClass
[20:48:54] <gnarf> :)
[20:49:22] <gnarf> actually tho
[20:49:24] <gnarf> the callback
[20:49:25] <gnarf> damn
[20:49:46] <gnarf> last i checked into it, the events fired on animations completing was a little unreliable
[20:50:48] <ajpiano> iirc, there are transition events
[20:50:56] <ajpiano> donno what they're called offhand tho
[20:51:43] <gnarf> i think nimbu was doing something regarding this and having issues
