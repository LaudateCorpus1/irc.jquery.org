[04:49:17] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping! and congrats!
[04:50:43] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[04:50:51] <uGoMobi> thanks :)
[04:51:19] <frequent> uGoMobi: so I hope you got a lot of rest before we can start poking with issues...
[04:51:46] <uGoMobi> haha... planning on a lazy weekend
[04:52:08] <frequent> sounds good.
[04:52:35] <frequent> so before you go on the well-deserved weekend, can you tell me why ui-field-contain is pos: relative?
[04:53:50] <uGoMobi> frequent: field containers used to get class ui-body
[04:54:19] <uGoMobi> frequent: ui-body has position relative
[04:54:24] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok
[04:54:33] <frequent> makes anything inside awfully hard to center
[04:54:56] <frequent> at least I struggled mightly, so I just wondered.
[04:54:58] <frequent> thx
[04:55:17] <uGoMobi> frequent: because ui-body didn't add much value we no longer add the class but I ported the position relative over to the field contain rule
[04:55:52] <uGoMobi> frequent: but before it should have been position relative as well
[04:56:19] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. I never really used field-containers, but I have a ton of fieldcontainers in my current project, so I will let you know how I fare with it :-)
[04:57:18] <uGoMobi> frequent: I wasn't sure if it would break anything if we wouldn't set position relative anymore
[04:57:53] <uGoMobi> frequent: happy to remove it if it turns out we don't need it
[04:59:20] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. Cool.

[05:55:00] <rook2pawn> is there a way to change from one page to another within the same page?
[06:03:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Morning
[06:03:45] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[06:03:52] <uGoMobi> what you doing here? ;-)
[06:04:21] <arschmitz> Something went weird durring a merge I have a missing commit!
[06:04:47] <arschmitz> I had a commit for button icon left issue
[06:05:10] <arschmitz> And I still see it on local branch but not master
[06:05:28] <arschmitz> So I'll have to cherry pick it
[06:06:11] <arschmitz> Also those Travis failures are not rando
[06:06:18] <uGoMobi> or just make new commit for master
[06:06:47] <uGoMobi> hmm, the failure i check was only 2.0.2 and didn't seem to be a real issue
[06:06:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: They are panel tests timing out on core 2.x
[06:07:01] <uGoMobi> aha
[06:07:07] <uGoMobi> hmm
[06:07:41] <arschmitz> So have to look at it Monday 
[06:07:58] <uGoMobi> yeah, let's look into this on Monday
[06:09:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: enjoy your weekend!
[06:09:43] <arschmitz> You too
[06:09:52] <uGoMobi> thanks
[06:12:37] <rook2pawn> if i have two pages in the same html, how can switch from one to the other as if i clicked on a <a> element?
[06:18:40] <uGoMobi> rook2pawn: #jquery is the channel for support
[06:19:29] <uGoMobi> rook2pawn: you can give the page an ID and then link to that ID... <a href="#mypageid"></a>
[06:24:19] <uGoMobi> rook2pawn: http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.changePage/
[06:27:48] <rook2pawn> i was worried if .changePage would be inappropriate (thinking it was more for loading external resources), but it happens to work fine for intra-page #ids
[07:37:29] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, team, help! Im having a requirejs.define issue (via node).
[07:37:35] <rxaviers> This code https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/amd-build/lib/rjs.js#L127-L130 defines a new requirejs "node/file" module. The goal is overload the default one. Actually, this defines that module in advance preventing the default one of being defined/used. (We need to overload that to make use of the memory-cached data instead of using filesystem to build things)
[07:37:40] <rxaviers> Running `node` and pasting this https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/amd-build/lib/rjs.js#L8-L10 lines (having a proper 1.11.0 prepared jquery-ui), it works just fine!
[07:37:44] <rxaviers> The thing is: running `node server.js`, my `./lib/rjs.js` gets called via https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/amd-build/lib/builder.js#L2, which calls https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/amd-build/lib/builder.1.11.0.js#L7, which runs the same `requirejs.define` above. Although, my new module never gets called. I don't know what's going on.
[07:37:49] <rxaviers> I have debugged it and noticed my define is still being called prior to the default define. Actually, the define calls order is exactly the same (via node, or via server).
[07:37:53] <rxaviers> Any ideas?
[07:40:26] <rxaviers> Or any ideas who could I bring to the discussion?
[07:40:53] <rxaviers> jrburke?
[07:41:16] <rxaviers> or the guys who wrote grunt-contrib-requirejs? (tkellen, ...)

[12:50:50] <Caraes_Naur> I have a question about datepicker's _generateHTML function
[12:58:25] <Caraes_Naur> why does it omit the ui-datepicker-close button if the inst is inline?
[13:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> Why wouldn't it?
[13:02:40] <Caraes_Naur> because I habe a use case where I need it in an inline inst
[13:03:53] <scott_gonzalez> That's not a reason. You need to explain the use case.
[13:04:22] <Caraes_Naur> ui-button that opens the datepicker
[13:05:07] <Caraes_Naur> there's no form, so I can't attach it to input
[13:05:36] <Caraes_Naur> it's on body > div#minical_anchor > span
[13:06:16] <Caraes_Naur> the button calls $('#minical_anchor').toggle()
[13:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/imozuq/1/edit
[13:08:49] <Caraes_Naur> that html isn't valid
[13:09:50] <scott_gonzalez> The W3C disagrees with you.
[13:09:54] <Caraes_Naur> and I don't want the datepicker to dismiss when a date is selected
[13:10:11] <Caraes_Naur> maybe it's valid html5, but I'm not doing html5
[13:10:24] <Caraes_Naur> I want the user to confirm their selection
[13:10:51] <scott_gonzalez> So build your own close button?
[13:14:15] <Caraes_Naur> would it be safe to inject a copy of line 8448 into the buttonpane?
[13:14:44] <Caraes_Naur> controls = (!inst.inline ? "<button type='button' class='ui-datepicker-close ...
[13:15:10] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea.
[13:23:51] <rxaviers> hey scott_gonzalez
[13:24:04] <rxaviers> did you have a change to read my question above?
[13:24:09] <rxaviers> chance*
[13:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I read it, but I haven't had time to look at it. I've been working on the CDN transition all day (still am).
[13:26:42] <rxaviers> sure, np. Thanks!
[13:27:16] <rxaviers> please just let me know if you can.
[13:27:24] <rxaviers> Im struggling with that one :-/
[13:50:04] <Caraes_Naur> scott_gonzalez: selecting a date wipes out my buttons
[15:55:34] <Caraes_Naur> scott_gonzalez: your jsbin got me in the right direction, although the onSelect: function(el, i) {return false} doesn't prevent the widget from disappearing
[15:58:41] <Caraes_Naur> because now the datepicker isn't inline
