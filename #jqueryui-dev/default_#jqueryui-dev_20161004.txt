[15:34:33] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Thoughts on this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1714/files
[15:34:45] <scott_gonzalez> Looking at it now, I'm thinking we probably shouldn't be removing that class.
[15:34:58] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps we should add a new class like ui-draggable-handle-enabled?
[15:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> And move the touch-action rule to that class.
[15:35:15] <scott_gonzalez> So we can remove that class when the draggable is disabled.
[15:35:38] <arschmitz> or we could just add
[15:36:06] <arschmitz> touch-action: auto to ui-draggable-disabled 
[15:36:21] <scott_gonzalez> That would still need to be on a new class.
[15:36:34] <arschmitz> isnt that added by the factory already
[15:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> The handle isn't always the entire draggable.
[15:36:49] <scott_gonzalez> And we can't use descendant selectors for this.
[15:37:06] <arschmitz> right the handle can be outside the draggable
[15:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> The handle has to be inside.
[15:37:34] <scott_gonzalez> But in general we can't use descendant selectors inside interactions.
[15:37:46] <scott_gonzalez> Because you can nest widgets.
[15:37:53] <arschmitz> oh nesting ok
[15:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I just merged a PR that has been open since before we added the widgets directory.
[15:40:18] <scott_gonzalez> That was fun...
[15:42:25] <arschmitz> :-/
[15:43:10] <arschmitz> yeah i guess a enabled class is ok i just generally prefer the opposite ( a disabled class ), however i also dislike css overrides lol
