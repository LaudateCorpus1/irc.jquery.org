[04:33:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[04:33:29] <Omar-> hi gabriel_schulhof
[04:33:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: What's up?
[04:33:49] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[04:33:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[04:33:55] <Omar-> how are you?
[04:33:59] <Omar-> wb arschmitz
[04:34:06] <arschmitz> Omar-: Morning
[04:34:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Is it OK if I push some stuff to ui-1-12 that fixes the tests? So far, mostly correcting AMD references.
[04:34:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: Could be worse ...
[04:34:42] <Omar-> arschmitz good morning
[04:34:57] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof haha take it easy
[04:35:17] <Omar-> Any plans to use flex-box in the future?
[04:35:49] <Omar-> especially for gird and controlgroup widgets
[04:35:51] <Omar-> http://caniuse.com/#search=flex
[04:36:41] <Omar-> arschmitz have you got the chance to check the fiddle that fixes #7732
[04:36:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: As I work the dialog extension's classes option, I ended up getting rid of all the dialog-related deprecated stuff, including in navigation. Now, I'd like to run the tests to separate those which point out problems from those which make now-invalid assumptions.
[04:36:46] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/2Lzpzay3/
[04:37:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... but some tests break as a result of having moved to the new widgets, rather than because of anything I did.
[04:37:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The fixes related to those breakages should go into ui-1-12.
[04:38:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: I don't think so, because flexbox is not supported in IE[89]
[04:39:52] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof I know, but it gives better results in terms of responsiveness
[04:40:22] <Omar-> drop IE [8-9] support :P
[04:41:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, their proportion /is/ below 5%, if caniuse is to be believed ... 
[04:52:26] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof or, use either flex-box based on detected browser.
[05:11:21] <arschmitz> Omar-: we will support ie 8 and 9 for a long long time
[05:11:41] <arschmitz> we only dropped 7 in 1.4 
[05:12:09] <arschmitz> people on old windows machines cant get ie10
[05:13:53] <Omar-> arschmitz is there a way to keep supporting IE yet use new technologies
[05:13:54] <Omar-> ?
[05:14:23] <arschmitz> Omar-: well there are things like feature tests if thats what you mean
[05:15:09] <Omar-> arschmitz yes, for example, if IE9 is detected, use old CSS
[05:15:31] <Omar-> if newer version, use new CSS e.g. flex-box
[05:15:36] <arschmitz> then it would be inconsistent
[05:16:00] <arschmitz> the whole point of things like JQM and jquery is to make things consistent across browsers
[05:16:40] <Omar-> true, it won't be cross-broswer anymore
[05:16:57] <arschmitz> there are some places its ok like border-radius
[05:17:11] <Omar-> but at least supporting browsers get better UI/UX
[05:17:34] <arschmitz> because its minor and visual flexbox would actually breeak layouts
[05:18:21] <arschmitz> Omar-: and there is nothing stoppping you from finding or writing a different widget that uses new things like flexbox
[05:18:41] <Omar-> arschmitz I've not tested in thoroughly so I cant judge
[05:18:54] <Omar-> I've used it maybe once or twice
[05:19:43] <Omar-> arschmitz http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/ZzCA2/show/ I used flexbox here
[05:20:33] <Omar-> swipe to change
[05:21:06] <arschmitz> Omar-: and have you tried that in ie8?
[05:21:30] <Omar-> no, I haven't used IE in 2 yrs haha
[05:21:48] <arschmitz> that page is pretty un usable there
[05:21:51] <Omar-> but the widget idea you've mentioned is nice
[05:22:03] <Omar-> i know, typical IE
[05:37:31] <Omar-> arschmitz issue #7733
[05:37:51] <Omar-> it's caused by changeHash: false
[05:38:34] <Omar-> previous page isn't retrieved from history.stack? upon closing a dialog, 
[05:38:44] <Omar-> $.mobile.navigate.history.stack
[05:39:11] <Omar-> pageUrl property no hash property since it's not updated when changeHash is false

[06:00:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: How do we want to handle backward compatibility of filterable to button inputs? Currently, it filters by text, but if button inputs are no longer mapped, do we need to make a special case where we check the value if it's a button input?
[06:00:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I ask because a filterable integration test that's filtering buttons inside a controlgroup is failing.

[07:49:41] <Omar-> hi arschmitz
[07:49:52] <Omar-> regarding #7733
[07:50:31] <arschmitz> Omar-: yes?
[07:50:47] <Omar-> i know it's because hash change is false
[07:51:03] <Omar-> but shouldnt be there a way to let user control it?
[07:51:29] <arschmitz> Omar-: they are contriling it they chose to set hashchange to false on that page
[07:51:36] <Omar-> the page with changeHash false is registered in history.stack but with .hash property
[07:52:32] <Omar-> without* .hash
[07:54:54] <arschmitz> ok?
[08:07:31] <Omar-> arschmitz so there should be a way to differentiate between "navigating directly to a page with hash false" and "navigating back to a page with hash false"
[08:07:44] <arschmitz> i didnt say there was not
[08:07:46] <Omar-> I meant crtl + U not I
[08:07:47] <Omar-> lol
[08:08:09] <arschmitz> Omar-: but when you set hashchange to false thats whats SUPPOSED to happen when you navigate back
[08:09:30] <Omar-> arschmitz I know. but in #7733 upon closing dialog, it should go back to root page where it was initiated.
[08:09:48] <Omar-> arschmitz I'm just thinking loudly
[08:11:13] <arschmitz> Omar-: no it shouldnt because they set hash change to false 
[08:11:23] <arschmitz> its the same if you have a custom select in a popup
[08:11:53] <Omar-> a custom-select in a popup shouldn't work
[08:12:04] <Omar-> as far as I remember
[08:12:09] <arschmitz> Omar-: no one that opens as a popup
[08:12:40] <Omar-> yup, chaining popups are removed in 1.3.2
[08:12:45] <Omar-> no longer work
[08:12:49] <Omar-> right?
[08:12:56] <arschmitz> Omar-: thats not what im talking about
[08:13:05] <arschmitz> selects open as either a popup or a dialog 
[08:13:10] <Omar-> ohhh
[08:13:15] <Omar-> sorry, yea got it
[08:13:22] <arschmitz> either way if you have change hash false it will go back a page
[08:13:27] <Omar-> i thought a custom-select inside a popup
[08:14:06] <arschmitz> this is how changehash false works its intended purpose is to never be able to reach that page via history
[08:14:20] <arschmitz> Omar-: so its doing what its suposed to
[08:15:54] <Omar-> arschmitz I understand
[08:59:29] <pcapozzi> hello
[09:08:24] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: hi
[09:13:23] <Omar-> arschmitz
[09:18:44] <arschmitz> Omar-: hi
[09:23:31] <Omar-> arschmitz have you got few mins to review my fix for #7732?
[09:24:21] <Omar->  http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/2Lzpzay3/ line 20
[09:36:37] <arschmitz> Omar-: its a lot easier to review if you do a PR
[09:37:12] <Omar-> arschmitz ok, I'll do a PR later this evening
[09:37:19] <arschmitz> Omar-: thank you
[09:37:27] <Omar-> maybe by then, I come up with better solution
[09:37:35] <Omar-> less code (DRY)
[10:02:06] <pcapozzi> Sorry on another server for a while.  Is there a meeting of Mobile at in an hour?
[10:08:17] <Omar-> pcapozzi i guess it was done yesterday
[10:10:25] <pcapozzi> ok maybe I can catch it next time
[10:10:38] <pcapozzi> do you know when that might be?
[10:12:37] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: there is one in about an hour
[10:13:00] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: its at 2:00pm EST every thursday
[10:13:06] <pcapozzi> cool
[10:13:44] <pcapozzi> I have been building a site using the jquery mobile widgets and am getting some strange behavior
[10:13:55] <pcapozzi> would that be a good time to bring that up
[10:14:09] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: that would not be something for the meeting 
[10:14:15] <arschmitz> you should file an issue
[10:18:42] <pcapozzi> Typically what I am seeing is that the widgets do not render properly on the first page build but if I refresh the page once or twice then it renders properly.
[10:18:58] <pcapozzi> Could I file a bug on that?
[10:20:41] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: yes but you will need to make a simplified test case
[10:20:46] <arschmitz> demonstrating the bug
[10:23:09] <pcapozzi> I have a public site that could be accessed that would show it
[10:23:37] <pcapozzi> I could build out the data so it would just be a couple of clicks to repro.
[10:23:45] <pcapozzi> Would that suffice?
[10:30:24] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: no we need a simplified test case somewhere we can review the code and make changes like jsbin
[10:30:52] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
[10:37:03] <pcapozzi> Is there a possibilty of using a data feed to populate the page?
[10:37:58] <pcapozzi> My problems seem to be when there are a lot of widgets (30-70) generated.
[10:39:33] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: my first suggestion would be to simplify your page
[10:39:47] <arschmitz> thats likely a but much for a mobile device
[10:39:57] <pcapozzi> k thanks
[10:40:17] <pcapozzi> interesting
[10:40:43] <pcapozzi> maybe I should only show x records and have a more button
[10:40:56] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: yes thats what i would recomend
[10:43:45] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: much much faster that way
[10:44:28] <pcapozzi> so my page has a panel and  (popups with  contol goups (radios))  and a collapsibleset with mutiple colapsables with selects (whcih I have to trigger or they break)
[10:45:35] <pcapozzi> So maybe what I am hearing is that jquery mobile doesnt like all that complexity and that is why on refresh (with less latency) it gets it right.
[10:45:51] <pcapozzi> sound reasonable?
[10:45:52] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: i would not say that
[10:46:31] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: i cant say what the problem is often fixing things on refresh is a result of a script out of place or wrong event binding
[10:47:02] <pcapozzi> good clues
[10:47:03] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: i would just say in general you should simplify because what your talking about sounds too complex and like it will be bad for both performance and user experience
[10:47:34] <pcapozzi> I am with you on the UI.
[10:48:26] <pcapozzi> I will revist the code for sequence of binding.  
[10:48:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. I'll make a special case in the default filter function.
[10:49:06] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: if you do find what you believe is a bug please do file an issue though
[10:49:27] <pcapozzi> will do
[10:49:30] <pcapozzi> Can you think of any really complex jquery mobile site on the web?
[10:49:43] <pcapozzi> That I can check?
[10:50:41] <arschmitz> pcapozzi: check out jqmgallery.com
[10:50:54] <pcapozzi> ok thanks
[11:04:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Shall we kick off the meeting?
[11:27:04] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Should we make that selectmenu issue a blocker for 1.11.2?
[11:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it.
[11:29:34] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I think so. I'm going to look into it tonight unless you have a good idea what the problem is.
[11:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> Go ahead and look at it. I'm not aware of what changed.
[11:31:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, marked as a blocker.
[11:33:29] <tj_vantoll> Ok will do.
[12:18:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: One last thing I wanted to ask: Obviously, in some cases we want to change the URL in the location, whereas in others we do not. This is where I imagine this transient thing coming in. It can be passed as an option to pagecontainer's change. It's normally false, meaning change the URL in the location, but if true, it does the pushState with no URL change.
[12:19:04] <gabriel_schulhof> So, how do we decide whether we want to change the location, rendering whatever destination deep-linkable, or not?
[12:20:33] <gabriel_schulhof> I was thinking <a href="#the-widget" data-ui-rel="widget" data-ui-transient="true">The Widget</a> and then pass { transient: link.attr( "data-ui-transient" ) } into changePage.
[12:21:58] <gabriel_schulhof> So, for example, for a dialog, we'd have <a href="#the-dialog" data-ui-transient="true">Open Dialog</a> and we'd basically have the old dialog behaviour back but without the ugly dialogHashKey
[12:29:18] <jtsage> i have one small question, re: -mobile if anyone has the time - I see what the classes option does, and I think i understand why it does - but not how.  Where is _classes() coming from?  -ui widget?  (Tried a few github searches and came up empty - just trying to keep up)
[12:31:49] <gabriel_schulhof> jtsage: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/790/files#diff-6d5657679729dec110717fc4d667b823L384
[12:31:49] <arschmitz> jtsage: its part of the widget factory
[12:32:24] <jtsage> gabriel_schulhof- that's exactly what I was after, thank you much
[12:32:31] <gabriel_schulhof> jtsage: NP.
[12:32:57] <arschmitz> jtsage: that implementation is not finalized yet
[12:33:05] <arschmitz> that is still a PR
[12:33:25] <jtsage> i assumed as much, thanks :)
