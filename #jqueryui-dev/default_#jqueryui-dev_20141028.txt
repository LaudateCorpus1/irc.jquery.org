[05:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Have you seen the Hipmunk calendar on mobile?
[05:12:15] <arschmitz> no
[05:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's pretty slick. You scroll up/down for more months.
[05:13:03] <arschmitz> oh i see they styled it as a scrollable list
[05:13:46] <arschmitz> you could totally do that with the new calendar widget combined with the mobile listview
[05:14:27] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and it would be nearly identical
[05:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> I actually just see a flat list when I view the markup.
[05:15:29] <scott_gonzalez> But that part doesn't matter. We could implement that however.
[05:15:39] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:15:41] <scott_gonzalez> It's a pretty nice UI for limited ranges.
[05:15:48] <arschmitz> yeah 
[05:16:01] <arschmitz> i like it
[05:16:17] <arschmitz> its one of the most usable ui's iv seen
[05:16:25] <arschmitz> on mobile
[05:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it works well.
[05:18:19] <arschmitz> it pretty much requires a full page dedicated to it though
[05:22:26] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: but i think thats part of why it is usable 
[06:22:08] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: 328 open.  
[06:22:51] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: Hey, did you have a chance to take a look at this pull request of mine to make sure it was an okay solution: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7783
[06:38:29] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: no i had not seen it ill look right now guess i missed it in my email so it never got a milestone
[06:53:46] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: thank you!  Okay, I'll keep digging through issues.  Still waiting on some code to reproduce a few of the cordova related ones you asked me to look into
[06:53:58] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: how long do you usually give people to respond before you go ahead and close?
[06:54:08] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: we actually normally close first
[06:54:12] <arschmitz> and if they respond reopen
[06:54:35] <arschmitz> it gets too hard to keep track of ones your waiting on

[09:58:35] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: is there a website showing the roadmap for jquery mobile for future releases?  Maybe talking about some of the upcoming ideas for the project.  Like are you guys looking into other frameworks, polyfills, ecma script support, etc.  Just to get an idea of where I (or other new contributors) might be able to help out.
[09:59:24] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: http://jquerymobile.com/roadmap/
[09:59:43] <arschmitz> it needs to be updated because a few things changed recently but thats the current roadmap basicly
[09:59:52] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: :) you're on top of it.  gracias
[10:00:17] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: any ideas on dates?
[10:00:46] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: no we dont give dates really
[10:00:56] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: basicly "when its done" 
[10:01:01] <lisa_deluca> :0
[10:01:02] <lisa_deluca> :)
[10:01:15] <arschmitz> because team members come and go and availability changes something comes up etc
[10:01:47] <lisa_deluca> makes sense, yea, don't want to promise something too soon either and get angry users
[10:01:58] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: yup
[10:02:17] <arschmitz> and being almost all volunteers its hard to plan very accurately 
[10:22:07] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: so jquery mobile has a dependency on 1.12 widgets?
[10:26:18] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: 1.5 will depend very heavinly on ui 1.12
[10:26:33] <arschmitz> but it will be part of the library
[10:26:39] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: you wont actually include both
[10:32:22] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: nice, that's what I figured.  So the plan is to eventually merge ui with mobile and have one? or will there always be a neat for separatation?
[10:32:33] <lisa_deluca> neat == need
[10:32:44] <arschmitz> There will allways be a seperation
[10:32:55] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: you should have watched my talk after yours in chicago lol
[10:33:03] <arschmitz> it was completely about this :-p
[10:33:12] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: link me to youtube
[10:33:23] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: I did watch your talk.  but apparently not closely enough
[10:33:40] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: i was just teasing 
[10:33:52] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qF7kW9SdJQ&index=4&list=PL-0yjdC10QYpmXI3l-PGK1od4kTWOjm_A
[10:34:06] <lisa_deluca> watching
[10:34:07] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: we already have parts of ui
[10:34:21] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/external/jquery-ui
[10:34:46] <arschmitz> but in 1.5 it looks like this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/ui-1-12/external/jquery-ui
[10:35:21] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: you're in portland me?!? I was *just* there for monktoberfest
[10:35:29] <arschmitz> yup
[10:36:26] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: crazy i have never heard of that
[10:36:36] <lisa_deluca> highly recommend
[10:36:47] <lisa_deluca> http://monktoberfest.com/
[10:36:59] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: yeah i was just looking at that

[10:38:27] <lisa_deluca> always next year
[10:38:47] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: yeah ill have to remember
[10:39:15] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: your talk is making more sense the second time through since I wasn't really contributing to jquery during the conf
[10:39:34] <arschmitz> yeah probably wouldnt mean much without some context
