[03:43:14] <M4rius> Hi, how come the interactions branch has so strongly diverged from the master branch and does not receive any updates anymore?
[04:28:32] <arschmitz> M4rius: because its going to be re-done based on pointer events once PEP is ready https://github.com/jquery/pep

[06:56:31] <M4rius> So the idea for the jQuery UI interactions is to transition from using MouseEvents to PointerEvents (using PEP). Through this not only MouseEvents but also TouchEvents (used for anything that is more than a click on a touch device) can trigger interactions. Currently, one would need plugins such as Touch Punch by furf to achieve this behaviour. What, besides a s/mouse/pointer/g and adding html attributes would the transition entail? I feel like there i
[06:56:31] <M4rius> lot more to it, which I do not yet see.   (jzaefferer arschmitz) 
[06:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> That's one part.
[06:57:36] <scott_gonzalez> The bigger part is a completel rewrite of every interaction.

[06:59:10] <scott_gonzalez> etc.
[07:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Think you'll get classes update pushed today?
[07:08:49] <arschmitz> we need to figure out the icons
[07:09:06] <arschmitz> but if we do that no problem

[07:11:48] <M4rius> Hui-jui-jui. Ok, I see. Would a clear cut between transition to PEP and rewrite make sense or should one rather do it all in one sweep? Would the complete rewrite be too much for one gsoc proposal, or is that feasible?
[07:14:57] <scott_gonzalez> You definitely could not finish the interaction rewrite during GSoC.
[07:16:23] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so want to talk icons so i can finish that up?
[07:16:55] <scott_gonzalez> Would be good if other people were around.
[07:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> Since we have differnet opinions on this.
[07:17:01] <arschmitz> true
[07:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> My view is that this has never been configurable and we've never had requests for it.
[07:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> It really has become stylistic as many resizable elements don't use the icon.
[07:19:20] <scott_gonzalez> Like every window in your OS.
[07:19:24] <scott_gonzalez> Even our own dialogs.
[07:20:14] <arschmitz> oh an i was not really saying i thought you should set what icon
[07:20:18] <arschmitz> i was saying it should be bool
[07:20:25] <arschmitz> like so you can just do icon false and not get it
[07:20:36] <arschmitz> i dont think i was clear on that
[07:20:37] <scott_gonzalez> I think that may be worse.
[07:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> A boolean for a hardcoded icon value.
[07:21:31] <scott_gonzalez> So if you want a different icon, you would use `{ icon: false, classes: { "ui-resizable-se": "ui-icon ui-icon-something-else" } }`
[07:21:34] <arschmitz> yeah an i guess with it as a theme class you can remove it
[07:21:38] <arschmitz> true
[07:22:17] <arschmitz> yeah so i think your right
[07:22:24] <arschmitz> see this was easy! :-)
[07:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> heh :-)
[07:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> VICTORY IS MINE!!!!!!!11
[07:22:57] <arschmitz> ok ill finish that up right now
[07:24:17] <M4rius> scott_gonzalez: Ok, I imagined the rewrite being too much. I am trying to find some proper chunk that is approx the right amount of work for gsoc. I guess this does depend on my skill / speed. Do you have some subset in mind that one could bundle into a nice package? gsoc somewhat requires this, right?
[07:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> You'll have to ask jzaefferer what he had in mind.
[07:29:18] <M4rius> Yeah sure

[09:57:32] <leobalter> hello
[09:58:48] <gauravmittal> leobalter: hey, for the "QUnit - Better diff output", do we need to change the whole of the current diff representation or just improve the current lib?
[09:59:24] <gauravmittal> leobalter: i made a comment in https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/364. Can you review it?
[10:00:17] <leobalter> these questions are better suited at the github issue. I'm busy in another project today but I'll take at look at github when possible.
[10:00:42] <gauravmittal> leobalter: ok ... thanks :)
[10:01:16] <leobalter> about the Diff: we need to improve and fix the addressed issues. If it relate to change the current diff to a new one, that's fine
