[17:22:41] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Added old changelogs (back to 1.8.11). - Scott Gonz√°lez
[22:51:49] <_zoggy_> on the download builder page, why does the 'click to design custom theme' take you to a url with all sorts of stuff customized?
[22:52:09] <_zoggy_> i would think it should take me to a clean slate, maybe prompt to pick a starting theme to use if i want
[22:52:37] <_zoggy_> oh nm i see its because the dropdown on the page happens to default to ui-lightness
[22:53:11] <_zoggy_> so if i go to customize with no theme selected, then go to download custom theme i end back up at http://jq02.stage.jquery.com:3000/download?themeParams=none
[22:53:26] <_zoggy_> and smoothness is somehow selected in the drop down
[22:53:48] <_zoggy_> odd
