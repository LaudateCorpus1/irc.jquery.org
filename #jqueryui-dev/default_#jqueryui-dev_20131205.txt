[04:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG. How are there 263 commits in the 1-4 branch of api.jquerymobile.com that don't exist in master?
[04:45:14] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: master = 1.3 API docs
[04:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> I know, but 263 changes?
[04:45:57] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds like either you're making changes in 1-4 which actually belong in master as well, or there are lots of super tiny changes happening or something crazy is going on.
[04:47:33] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: checking the commits now and I see changes that should have been made on master
[04:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> You're gonna have a hell of a time keeping these branches in sync now.
[04:47:58] <uGoMobi> also a lot of small changes
[04:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably worth the time to squash the hell out of this branch.
[04:48:54] <scott_gonzalez> And get changes that belong in master into master and rebase 1-4.
[04:55:57] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell tj_vantoll I rebased 1-11 again (docs)
[04:55:57] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Iâ€™ll tell tj_vantoll about that.
[04:57:17] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell tj_vantoll I don't think this will conflict again, but just in case, I modified this old commit to be protocol-relative: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commit/0a283b7fbbe6cfccbbeda457f405ddc4bde7d109#diff-483dec7c10920f8232fe38109fd35ea4R122
[04:57:17] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Iâ€™ll tell tj_vantoll about that.
[05:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: Can you please make sure somebody gets the equivalent of https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/65e63091a94516c8a9acae7b285d28eb7d7ae493 into 1-4?
[05:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally 1-4 is rebased on master, which will pull in those changes.
[05:02:46] <scott_gonzalez> But someone will still need to go through all the new content and make sure it's correct.
[05:02:59] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ok I will

[08:30:37] <uGoMobi> all fine here
[08:30:55] <uGoMobi> as long as I stay inside (big storm here)
[08:31:52] <uGoMobi> 1.4 release is going slow... didn't have much time to work on new web site :(
[08:32:06] <uGoMobi> gseguin: how are you?
[08:32:40] <gseguin> good, spending some time on the new release script today
[08:32:53] <gseguin> yeah the storm has passed here but it's -20C outside
[08:32:59] <gseguin> sunny though
[08:33:56] <uGoMobi> wow -20C ?
[08:34:28] <uGoMobi> ski resorts nearby?
[08:34:29] <gseguin> yup, bit chilly
[08:34:42] <gseguin> yeah 45 minutes away is the closest
[08:34:58] <uGoMobi> oh that's cool
[08:46:09] <RWhitbeck> uGoMobi I know I haven't been the biggest help with the new site ... if you can assign me a task at a time I can probably help better that way. 
[09:52:01] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: you there?
[09:52:27] <scott_gonzalez> I am.
[09:53:00] <gseguin> I started working on a release script for mobile using jquery-release
[09:53:11] <gseguin> I'm having a weird issue wonder if you've seen that
[09:53:42] <gseguin> I haven't overriden generateArtifacts yet so it's just calling the callback with an empty array
[09:53:52] <gseguin> I put a breakpoint in _createTag
[09:54:01] <gseguin> I do get the empty array
[09:54:28] <gseguin> but the paths.concat( "package.json" ); doesn't do anything
[09:54:32] <gseguin> oh wait!
[09:54:52] <gseguin> shouldn't it be: paths = paths.concat( "package.json" ); ?
[09:55:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[09:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> This is 100% untested code :-P
[09:55:17] <gseguin> ok fixing
[09:55:39] <gseguin> should I create a ticket or just commit ?
[09:57:40] <scott_gonzalez> Just commit.
[09:57:44] <gseguin> k
[09:59:14] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: If you're working on getting this into mobile, I have a library to help with with GitHub integration.
[09:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/github-request
[09:59:33] <gseguin> I'll look into it
[09:59:35] <gseguin> thanks
[09:59:52] <gseguin> I'm not there yet, I need to generate the artifacts first
[09:59:57] <scott_gonzalez> And here's an example of leveraging the returned metadata to do automatic paging: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/hookup/blob/master/lib/hookup.js#L84-L101
[10:01:12] <scott_gonzalez> The automatic paging is nice because it makes getting a list of all repos as simple as: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/hookup/blob/master/lib/hookup.js#L106-L110
[10:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> So getting all issues that match some criteria should be just as easy.
[10:04:08] <gseguin> oh for the changelog?
[10:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:04:21] <gseguin> k
[10:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: I'm actually working on a bunch of GitHub integration stuff right now, so I can do the changelog portion if you want.
[10:18:24] <scott_gonzalez> Also, it's entirely possible that there are more hooks that need to be added.
[10:18:35] <gseguin> ok, I'm going to try to port the things I had done for uploading to the CDN repo
[10:18:38] <scott_gonzalez> So far I only wrote the portions that could mostly be copied from the UI script.
[10:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> great
[10:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> Here's the issue for that: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/issues/5
[10:19:01] <gseguin> I'm discovering the code right now
[10:19:07] <gseguin> yeah I remember
[10:19:26] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: would that be a common step?
[10:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's common.
[10:19:48] <gseguin> k
[10:19:57] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll need to figure out how to specify what gets uploaded.
[10:20:17] <scott_gonzalez> Could potentially be as easy as just saying the repo-specific code has to generate a /dist/cdn/ directory.
[10:20:17] <gseguin> yeah I was thinking exaclty about that
[10:20:46] <gseguin> that or have a getArtifacts function
[10:21:24] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that'd end up being an awkward API, wouldn't it?
[10:21:34] <scott_gonzalez> Because you'd need to specify source path in the repo and destination path in the CDN.
[10:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> It's not like the release artifacts where you already have a defined path (the root of the repo) to work from.
[10:28:06] <gseguin> true
[10:28:43] <gseguin> so uploadCDNArtifacts( root ) would be all we need
[10:30:06] <gseguin> where root is the root path inside the codeorigin.jquery.com repo for the project
[10:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> The root path for the project is easily determined without the repo telling you.
[10:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> The release script knows the project name.

[12:03:43] <uGoMobi> we have seen that issue before
[12:03:53] <uGoMobi> but I also saw it was fixed
[12:04:34] <uGoMobi> it was because of .class.ui-btn-a.class wasn't changed into .class.ui-btn-b.class
[12:04:46] <uGoMobi> (if I am not mistaken)
[12:05:19] <uGoMobi> ah wait, he is mentioning that too
[12:05:42] <uGoMobi> I was so impressed by the screenshot that I forgot to look at the rest of the ticket :)
[12:31:16] <tj_vantoll1> Looking for another opinion on this one: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9693
[12:31:35] <tj_vantoll1> My opinion is to close this as patcheswelcome.
[12:32:32] <tj_vantoll1> Seems like it's crashing due to a ton of processing, but we have to do :data(ui-droppable).
[12:33:10] <tj_vantoll1> So I don't have a good suggestion for how to optimize this and it is obviously an edge case.
[12:42:48] <tj_vantoll1> I went ahead and closed it as patcheswelcome. If anyone disagrees please comment.
[12:49:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I figure it's a regex issue ... it must be in a different place.
[13:02:11] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: so I'm not sure what you're saying
[13:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: There should be zero config for the CDN portion.
[13:02:31] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: if I make a common task cdn.uploadArtifacts
[13:03:01] <gseguin> how does the common task know where to copy on the clone of codeorigin repo?
[13:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> It should read from /dist/cdn/ and it should determine the path the CDN repo based on the project name and the version number.
[13:03:24] <gseguin> oh I see
[13:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> if ( project === "jquery" ) use root
[13:03:45] <gseguin> yup
[13:03:48] <gseguin> got it
[13:03:56] <scott_gonzalez> else if ( /^jquery-/... ) use remaining portion
[13:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> else use projec tname
[13:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Task name should probably be _pushToCdn or _deployToCdn.
[13:07:21] <gseguin> _pushToCdn it is
[13:08:49] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: and it's ok to hardcode git@github.com:jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com.git
[13:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah

[14:13:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There were three places where the same regexs were being used for replacing one swatch letter with another: duplicate swatch, add swatch, and import theme. I factored out the regexs into one place (a function called TR.replaceSwatchLetter) and called the function from all three places. So, if we have trouble with swatch letters in the future, we only need to fix the problem in one place.
