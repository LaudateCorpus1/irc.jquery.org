[04:03:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[04:29:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[04:37:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[04:37:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: For the loader, the defaultHtml is exposed and people might be using it.
[04:38:16] <arschmitz> ok
[04:38:19] <gabriel_schulhof> If we add tracking to the elements, and someone simply replaces the html, we'll have an element leak.
[04:38:49] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we just deprecate it
[04:38:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ... 
[04:39:00] <arschmitz> there are html options like that in ui we just deprecated them all
[04:39:29] <gabriel_schulhof> This isn't even an option. It's simply an instance level property.
[04:40:23] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll try to think of some backcompat we could do.
[04:43:30] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, the only thing that's documented is resetHtml() - we could deprecate that end document that it no longer does anything.
[04:43:39] <gabriel_schulhof> s/end/and/
[04:44:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Same for fakeFixLoader and checkLoaderPosition, actually ...
[04:58:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah this is just like in ui
[04:58:50] <arschmitz> just a sec

[04:59:14] <arschmitz> oops

[05:01:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: those are not options either just extension points
[05:09:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: for fakeFixLoader we dont support any browsers without fixed position any more
