[05:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll mikesherov _zoggy_ kborchers gnarf petersendidit: Can anyone think of a reason not to remove the `overflow: hidden` from .ui-dialog?
[05:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> The dialog contents are constrained and always smaller than the wrapper.
[05:19:34] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yes, I can think of a theoretical one
[05:19:40] <mikesherov> oh, in that case, no
[05:19:59] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: including if it's an iframe?
[05:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...is there a forced minimim size of iframes?
[05:20:42] <scott_gonzalez> We have this function, which sets the dimensions of the content and wrapper based on the options: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L623
[05:20:48] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: no, just brainstorming edge cases
[05:21:04] <mikesherov> man, I wish we had a unit tested history
[05:21:08] <scott_gonzalez> The use case I'm trying to support is autocomplete menu being appended to the dialog instead of the body.
[05:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> Right now the menu gets cut-off because of the overflow.
[05:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> But things like autocomplete and tooltip should flow out, even if appended to the dialog.
[05:22:18] <tj_vantoll> .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-buttonpane .ui-dialog-buttonset {
[05:22:18] <tj_vantoll> 	float: right;
[05:22:18] <tj_vantoll> }
[05:22:18] <tj_vantoll> Just brainstorming but is it possibly needed to clear this float?
[05:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: hmm....let me check.
[05:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[05:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> At least not in Chrome, that wouldn't be browser-specific, right?
[05:24:21] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.7.x core build #149: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.7.x%20core/149/
[05:25:05] <mikesherov> i missed what tj_vantoll just wrote
[05:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> WHOA
[05:25:12] <scott_gonzalez> New BrowserStack UI.
[05:25:21] <tj_vantoll> oh wow
[05:25:26] <scott_gonzalez> He asked if it was to clear the floats from the button pane.
[05:27:26] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/LMCDE/
[05:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> I know about the resize handler, I'm just removing the icon.
[05:28:28] <tj_vantoll> Ah ok.
[05:29:12] <tj_vantoll> It looks like the ui-helper-clearfix class is handling the clearing.  I would just confirm that it is indeed clearing the buttons in IE 7 and IE 8.
[05:29:35] <scott_gonzalez> Just checked IE7.
[05:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> Checking IE8 now.
[05:29:55] <tj_vantoll> That's the only reason for overflow: hidden that I can think of.
[05:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good in IE8 as well.
[05:30:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not sure why it was there.
[05:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...for some reason we set a width on .ui-dialog as well.
[05:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> Seems silly since we always set the size in JS.
[05:34:57] <tj_vantoll> Even if someone has floated content within the dialog it'll still be cleared without overflow: hidden on .ui-dialog - http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/hFAyH/.
[05:35:00] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/41f9367f16222af38269
[05:36:16] <tj_vantoll> Wow, I hadn't seen the new look of gist yet either.  Crazy morning.
[05:38:17] <tj_vantoll> What about top: 0 and left: 0?  Aren't those just as irrelevant as width?
[05:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> They're stupidly necessary.
[05:38:45] <scott_gonzalez> Absolute positioning isn't really absolute without them.
[05:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> So .position() will fail to position elements properly because it won't know where it currently is.
[05:39:59] <tj_vantoll> Ah, makes sense.  I think I've ran into that before.
[05:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, where the element stays in its current position but is in a quasi-absolute mode.
[05:41:22] <tj_vantoll> Then +1 on https://gist.github.com/41f9367f16222af38269.  I can't think of issues with that.
[05:41:23] <scott_gonzalez> Thouhts on removing the `outline: 0`?
[05:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> There's no other way to know that the dialog itself has focus.
[05:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> I guess you could maybe make a case for saying that dialogs are like <body>
[05:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> and <body> doesn't show focus.
[05:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'll leave it in.
[05:43:51] <tj_vantoll> How can you explicitly give the dialog focus?  Just curious what it would look like with an outline.
[05:44:41] <scott_gonzalez> Click in the middle of the dialog.
[05:44:58] <scott_gonzalez> Or create a dialog with no focusable content and hide the close button with CSS.
[05:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> They're generally edge cases.
[05:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> And cases that a keybaord user shouldn't really run into.
[05:50:40] <tj_vantoll> Interesting.  Like you said it probably doesn't matter because I can't think of any situation where you would want a dialog like that.

[10:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Got another update on progressbar.
[10:51:59] <scott_gonzalez> Firefox is exposing state: mixed
[10:52:59] <scott_gonzalez> Which seems to be the only thing it should be doing.
[10:53:34] <kborchers> so is it just NVDA not recognizing it?
[10:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it.
[10:54:12] <scott_gonzalez> But if affects NVDA, JAWS, and Orca.
[10:54:22] <kborchers> hmmm
[10:54:40] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently Chromevox announces "progress bar min zero"
[10:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> So VoiceOver is the only one gettin it right.
[10:55:01] <scott_gonzalez> Not so great.
[10:56:08] <kborchers> so should we go the valuetext route until the others get it? if we do, we'll probably get double announcements in voice over, right?
[10:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure, I can check that now.
[11:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..VoiceOver seems confused.
[11:01:18] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like in Chorme, it ignores aria-valuetext and in Firefox it alwasys thinks the progressbar is indeterminate.
[11:01:42] <kborchers> weird
