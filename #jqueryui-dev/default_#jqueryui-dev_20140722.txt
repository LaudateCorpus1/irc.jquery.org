[03:02:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[03:03:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: There's not much news on the Korean side - we're just talking in #web-ui-fw. But, if you'd like to share something with the group, I can ask them to move to #jquery-meeting.
[03:04:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: if no one else has anything i dont really right now
[03:04:35] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. That's cool.

[07:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Guess what I've spent all morning doing?
[07:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> Reducing http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10152 from the fiddle.
[07:50:00] <scott_gonzalez> It hasn't been fun.
[07:50:31] <scott_gonzalez> But I've got it down to https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/9a0a17809a4bb47a48d2 and it fails against a local file :-)
[07:50:51] <scott_gonzalez> The iframe has to point to a different origin though.
[07:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why the CodeMirror editor has to be there for the bug to exist.
[07:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> Next step is to start ripping apart those external JS files.
[07:52:00] <tj_vantoll> o_O
[07:53:43] <scott_gonzalez> At first I thought it might be related to the web fonts.
[07:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> Because when I duplicated jsFiddle locally, that was the only thing that I couldn't get working.
[07:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> And of course the error didn't occur.
[07:54:10] <scott_gonzalez> Which doesn't make any sense to me.
[07:55:20] <scott_gonzalez> There's something strange though that may have been tripping me up.
[07:55:31] <tj_vantoll> It seems to be related to focus though right?
[07:55:42] <scott_gonzalez> If you open the original fiddle and click the titlebar, it doesn't throw an error.
[07:55:53] <scott_gonzalez> But if you open the fiddle, then open dev tools, then click, it does.
[07:56:03] <tj_vantoll> THE PLOT THICKENS
[07:56:05] <scott_gonzalez> Clicking inside the body of the dialog seems to always cause the error.
[07:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm not sure what's up with that.
[07:56:35] <scott_gonzalez> I've just been clicking in the body since I figured that out.
[07:56:53] <tj_vantoll> That makes no sense, but I just verified that it happens.
[07:57:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that fooled me a few times.
[07:58:26] <scott_gonzalez> Well, at least now that I've got it pointing at a local file, I can start doing some debugging.
[08:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I'm torn on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10329
[08:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> While I would expect ui.size to be the final size, I'm not inclined to change the way the current implementation works.
[08:47:02] <scott_gonzalez> And the unexpected result is technically correct according to the docs.
[08:49:58] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7453
[08:50:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, good enough.
[08:50:34] <tj_vantoll> I agree with you, but I think closing as a duplicate is fine for now.
[08:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> yup, done
[08:51:28] <scott_gonzalez> We had a full week of reducing the ticket count.
[08:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> Can't let it get back up :-P
[08:51:55] <tj_vantoll> :)
[08:51:58] <scott_gonzalez> I've noticed that some of the spam tickets have been slipping through because emails aren't getting sent out.
[08:52:07] <scott_gonzalez> I've been tracking them down in the Trac timeline.
[08:52:11] <tj_vantoll> ugh
[08:52:42] <tj_vantoll> Are we expecting the Trac upgrade to "fix" the spamming issue?
[08:53:22] <scott_gonzalez> Well, not the upgrade to 1.0, but we're hoping to add a plugin for email validation during registration.
[08:53:39] <tj_vantoll> Ah ok.
[08:54:53] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't seem like there's been much interest from the core team: http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/4286
[08:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> We can use http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin though
[09:12:21] <gseguin> arschmitz, gabriel_schulhof: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/cannot-change-cursor-position-for-inputs-in-iframe 
[09:12:50] <gseguin> any idea what could be going on, is that something we can work around ?
[09:13:09] <arschmitz> gseguin: not sure never seen it before
[09:13:46] <gseguin> basically if you have a text field in an iframe and you have vmouse you can't reposition the cursor

[09:14:22] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06master 141071346 15Scott Gonz√°lez: Build: Upgrade to jquery-mousewheel 3.1.12
[09:15:46] <gseguin> arschmitz: I've been pulling my hair on this for a couple days
[09:16:46] <gseguin> arschmitz: try the jsbins on a device, you'll see it's very annoying
[09:17:43] <arschmitz> gseguin: its something we did in 1.3
[09:17:48] <arschmitz> gseguin: it works in 1.2
[09:17:56] <gseguin> argh!
[09:18:14] <gseguin> git bisect, to the rescue!
[09:19:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: im going to blame clear button
[09:21:02] <gseguin> arschmitz: why?
[09:21:10] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI build #1397: STILL UNSTABLE in 7 min 2 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI/1397/
[09:21:11] <doesallmagic2> Scott Gonz√°lez: Build: Upgrade to jquery-mousewheel 3.1.12
[09:21:12] <arschmitz> its the only widget on the page
[09:21:18] <arschmitz> it was introduced in 1.3
[09:21:29] <arschmitz> and it is a textinput
[09:21:43] <gseguin> hmm... In the app I noticed the issue I'm only using vmouse
[09:22:08] <arschmitz> so what did we change in vmouse in 1.3 then...
[09:22:13] <gseguin> looking
[09:22:21] <arschmitz> i cant imagine much probably some bug fix 
[09:22:41] <arschmitz> gseguin: out of curiosity why are you using vmouse instead of a pointer events polyfill?
[09:22:56] <gseguin> good question
[09:23:28] <arschmitz> gseguin: i can say every issue im aware of with vmouse or similar in mobile is fixed by the polymer pointer events polyfill
[09:23:41] <gseguin> hmm, ok let me try that
[09:23:49] <arschmitz> gseguin: what do you need to support for browsers ie8 or 9?
[09:23:57] <gseguin> we do
[09:24:03] <arschmitz> oh bummer 
[09:24:13] <gseguin> oh yeah I remember now
[09:24:23] <gseguin> it crapped out on these IE
[09:24:33] <gseguin> that's why I opted for vmouse
[09:24:38] <gseguin> I did try polymer
[09:24:41] <arschmitz> its only ie10 plus until kris or scott or someone finishes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-pointer-events
[09:25:00] <arschmitz> that adds old ie support its just still got some bugs
[09:25:32] <gseguin> thanks for the heads up
[09:26:48] <arschmitz> gseguin: that bug is weird and annoying but im going to say fixable if you bisect it
[09:27:02] <gseguin> arschmitz: nothing changed in vmouse between 1.2 and 1.3
[09:27:15] <gseguin> oh wait I compared the branches
[09:27:20] <gseguin> let me compare tags
[09:27:52] <gseguin> arschmitz: yeah just a slight change in the AMD wrapper
[09:28:00] <gseguin> no code change per se
[09:28:01] <arschmitz> weird
[09:28:25] <arschmitz> gseguin: i tried 1.2.0 maybe its in a 1.2 patch
[09:29:06] <gseguin> I diffed 1.2.0 vs 1.3.0
[09:29:17] <gseguin> I should have seen something
[09:33:08] <arschmitz> gseguin: hmmmm odd
[09:35:07] <arschmitz> gseguin: your app ONLY has vmouse?
[09:35:33] <jperrault> If I want to reproduce a jsfiddle sample locally, do I throw the stuff in the javascript pane inside of <script> tags in the <head> of the html page?
[09:36:45] <arschmitz> gseguin: there has not really been a change to vmouse since 1.1.0 not even a bug fix
[09:38:02] <arschmitz> jperrault: the easiest way is to add /show to url then view source copy and paste :)
[09:39:34] <jperrault> arschmitz: exactly what i was looking for, thanks!  should have asked before I pulled out all that hair.
[09:39:49] <arschmitz> jperrault: no problem
[09:46:42] <gseguin> arschmitz: yes only vmouse
[09:46:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: that makes no sense
[09:47:10] <gseguin> arschmitz: why? if you want to use vclick
[09:47:21] <gseguin> arschmitz: school me ;)
[09:47:23] <arschmitz> i can easily reproduce in 1.3.0 but its fine in 1.2.0 and there are no changes
[09:47:38] <arschmitz> gseguin: not your use of vmouse that you see this issue with ONLY vmouse
[09:47:47] <arschmitz> when it has not changed
[09:47:53] <gseguin> arschmitz: I agree!
[09:48:19] <arschmitz> gseguin: well there are only like 6 commits i would suggest checking out and trying each one
[09:48:34] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'll try that
[09:48:50] <arschmitz> gseguin: maybe some how one of the amd changes or something had someing in it it should not have 
[09:51:25] <arschmitz> gseguin: actually this looks like the only commit for vmouse in 1.3
[09:51:26] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/e802d5ad665480d91bdd67e22a2134609fb02d6a
[09:51:41] <gseguin> arschmitz: right
[09:52:30] <gseguin> arschmitz: the IIFE sends jQuery for the $ param
[09:52:35] <gseguin> hence the change
[09:52:55] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah i know i dont see how it would do this its just the only 1.3.x commit
[09:57:41] <arschmitz> gseguin: think i found the issue
[09:57:44] <arschmitz> kinda
[09:57:56] <gseguin> arschmitz: what is it, what is it?
[09:58:13] <arschmitz> gseguin: i say kinda because i found why it works in 1.2.0
[09:58:27] <arschmitz> in 1.3.0 we start adding a vclick binding for something
[09:58:38] <arschmitz> gseguin: this only happens once you bind to vclick
[09:58:55] <arschmitz> it happens in 1.2.0 once you add a binding to vclick
[09:59:14] <gseguin> arschmitz: not clear
[09:59:46] <arschmitz> gseguin: in 1.3.0 we added a binding to vclick on init
[09:59:57] <arschmitz> gseguin: i was testing with the jsbin which uses full lib
[10:00:23] <arschmitz> when i reduced to just vmouse i found it work in 1.3.0 until you add a binding to vclick
[10:00:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: so i went back to 1.2.0 and add a binding to vclick and i can now reproduce the problem in 1.2.0 also
[10:01:04] <arschmitz> so its not a new problem its just not previously exposed in the same way
[10:01:15] <gseguin> arschmitz: ok
[10:01:35] <gseguin> arschmitz: any idea how to work around it?
[10:03:04] <arschmitz> gseguin: nope because no idea whats causing it would have to dig into vclick
[10:03:19] <arschmitz> gseguin: also its still a problem in 1.0.0 just checked
[10:03:34] <gseguin> ok, so it's an old old bug
[10:03:40] <arschmitz> gseguin: so sadly not a regression we can bisect 
[10:03:44] <arschmitz> gseguin: yup
[10:04:08] <gseguin> DAMNIT Kin! ;)
[10:04:41] <arschmitz> gseguin: good guess though https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/3cb884b6d71bf63f08221ec8acca54f746ab7b81/js/jquery.mobile.vmouse.js#L347
[10:05:21] <arschmitz> gseguin: its the only preventDefault call in the file
[10:05:40] <gseguin> arschmitz: yeah we should exclude inner iframe events if there is a way to filter them
[10:08:48] <gseguin> arschmitz: are you iterating on jsbin?
[10:09:42] <gseguin> arschmitz: can you share your bin?
[10:28:03] <gseguin> arschmitz: it doesn't reach that code when tapping on words in the iframe
[13:32:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Is it just me or has jsbin become completely unreliable?
[13:33:20] <gabriel_schulhof> I see one thing in the edit view, but if I go to preview, my code is gone.
[13:42:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: are you signed in they started deleteing anonymous ones
[13:42:13] <arschmitz> and it will put a banner at top saying its been deleted
[13:42:31] <gseguin> arschmitz: this thing is driving me insane
[13:42:52] <arschmitz> yeah i was playing in a jsbin on it
[13:42:59] <arschmitz> but i didnt figure out the source yet
[13:46:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: No, for me it's more the "this is someone else's live stream" thingy.
[13:47:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: As soon as it says that it starts discarding your changes upon preview.
[13:47:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, and if you try to clone, it'll clone without whatever changes you've made since it gave you the banner.
[13:48:08] <gabriel_schulhof> At this point, I'd rather just work locally and post the final result to a jsbin. Disappoint.
