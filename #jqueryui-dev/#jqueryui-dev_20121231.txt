[06:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: hey
[06:47:57] <rxaviers> hello!!
[06:49:06] <rxaviers> themeroller page seems ugly in new-css
[06:49:22] <rxaviers> Im starting to open issues for each thing I find weird, and will start addressing each one
[06:50:11] <rxaviers> this way will be easier to know what Im working on
[06:52:59] <scott_gonzalez> There's probably going to be a fair amount of work to counteract the styles in new-css.
[06:53:09] <scott_gonzalez> But some of the stuff is easy to fix.
[06:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> In the /* ui site overrides for TR */ section, remove everything.
[06:53:34] <scott_gonzalez> Then add: #application-content * { box-sizing: content-box; }
[06:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> That should be a good starting point.
[06:53:53] <scott_gonzalez> Also, make sure you're using the new-css branch in jqueryui.com as well.

[06:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: The screenshots look like they're in the wrong branch.
[06:59:18] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, thanks!
[06:59:31] <rxaviers> new-css branch in jqueryui.com <- I wasnt
[06:59:46] <rxaviers> will fix
[07:00:09] <rxaviers> I had noticed the overrides, great about the application-content box-sizing 
[07:00:44] <scott_gonzalez> You'll want to create a new-css branch in download.jqueryui.com as well.
[07:01:13] <rxaviers> yeap I will ;)
[07:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, let me know if you need any help or have any questions.
[07:02:45] <rxaviers> thank you! I will

[07:11:05] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, the header is centralized for themeroller and DB. But, left aligned for other sections. Is that right?
[07:11:34] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[07:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> Because the other pages have sidebars.
[07:16:12] <rxaviers> ok
[07:22:34] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I've noticed an issue: on small widths, a remaining empty space appears on the right, allowing user to scroll
[07:22:38] <rxaviers> May I open an issue?
[07:23:06] <scott_gonzalez> Is this TR specific or all pages?
[07:23:31] <rxaviers> al
[07:23:32] <rxaviers> all
[07:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, file that against web-base-template

[07:49:48] <rxaviers> Amended with prefixed box-sizings for mozilla and webkit ^
[10:44:32] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ping
[10:46:42] <scott_gonzalez> hey rxaviers
[10:49:13] <rxaviers> any ideas how can I counteract the following style? #content ul li { background: url(...)}. This messes up with ul.icons > li, where background-image is set on .ui-state-default, .ui-widget-content .ui-state-default, .ui-widget-header .ui-state-default
[10:49:47] <rxaviers> I am trying to come up with a #themeroller ul li {background: <something>}
[10:50:23] <rxaviers> or background-image: something to couteract that. But, the only one that would solve it would be to re-implement ui-state-* style
[10:50:55] <rxaviers> Ideally, I would be able to cancel all [base.css] #content > * styles.
[10:51:05] <rxaviers> Considering using js to change its id or something
[10:53:57] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Or if I could add a class to body like "skip-content-styles" that would prevent #content > * styles. That would be great
[10:54:28] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...let me see
[10:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> I think $( "#content" ).removeAttr( "id ") is fine.
[10:55:53] <scott_gonzalez> That's actually a pretty good solution, since a lot of rules are tied to #content.
[10:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> Probably makes themeroller.css much more sane.
[10:57:33] <rxaviers> yeap!
[10:57:34] <rxaviers> it will
[10:57:37] <rxaviers> ok will use that then
[10:58:30] <rxaviers> although, I'll need to re-implement some styles: like centralizing header
[11:00:02] <rxaviers> reimplementing now is no big deal. The deal is that it will need constant maintenance over web-base-template upgrades
[11:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, it's a bit painful.
[11:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> Unless we keep everything in web-base-template scoped to #content.

[13:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I have faith in your CSS writing abilities. I landed that without even opening a single page to verify :-)
[13:11:50] <rxaviers> im pretty sure about that. One thing Im not sure is: maybe we can drop :placeholder <- without prefix, because I dont know if that exists
[13:12:37] <rxaviers> right now I was looking for a spec about it. But, not finding
[13:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, doesn't seem like there is a standard for this.
[13:17:31] <rxaviers> yeap seems so

[14:08:10] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Im leaving for today
[14:08:19] <rxaviers> Happy New Year
[14:08:35] <rxaviers> everyone
[14:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> Happy New Year rxaviers
[14:10:47] <rxaviers> by the way, new-css of TR and DB is much better now. Although, WIP. I see some remaining places needing fix
[14:13:13] <rxaviers> by the way 2, can we scope this? https://github.com/rxaviers/web-base-template/commit/71ec6c181746eef50144f3722246ac35d2868d20
[14:13:31] <rxaviers> need to know which class/id we can? #content?
[14:14:00] <rxaviers> leaving the question now, will check later
