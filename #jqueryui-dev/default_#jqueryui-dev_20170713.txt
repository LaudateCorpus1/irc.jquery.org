[20:20:11] <ElBobby> Quick question: Has anyone else noticed that Chrome59 has issues rendering the JQueryUI menu widget?
[20:20:59] <ElBobby> Here's the link to the jqueryui.com demo page: https://jqueryui.com/menu/#default
[20:22:35] <ElBobby> Menu items with a submenu (icon) have a "blank line" above them.
[20:30:35] <ElBobby> Seems to be caused by the list-style-image setting on the .ui-menu .ui-menu-item LI. Setting this to 'none' resolves the problem.
[22:29:26] <nikio_> so whats up with jquerymobile? is that thing going forward?
