[00:07:56] <nacin> rworth: with regards to activation of per-site plugins, see web-base-template/mu-plugins/_loader.php and the "plugins.jquery.com" folder
[00:08:37] <nacin> rworth: separately, we can also handle per-site plugins as part of the install script. (It would actually just go in domains.php, which is used by both the install script and the domain-mapping code in config.php and sunrise.php)
[00:11:54] <nacin> rworth: not sure what "the static index" is referring to
[00:13:05] <nacin> ah. I guess I wrote that plugin. :)
[00:13:36] <nacin> we would add it to the install script.
[00:13:55] <nacin> we may also enforce it in a mu-plugin.

[00:17:53] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on web-base-template by Andrew Nacin (20.053s ago): Activate jquery-static-index.php on sizzlejs.com during install.
[00:41:10] <gnarf> nacin: legacy. is hosted on jq01.stage
[00:41:20] <gnarf> nacin: /var/www/wordpress-legacy
[00:41:26] <gnarf> same IPs
[03:51:14] <rworth> nacin gnarf having debugging turned on for stage. and legacy. was preventing deployment. I commented it out of wp-config.php for both until https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/38 is fixed. Thanks
[03:51:15] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #38 on web-base-template (rdworth; 4m, 13s ago): Debugging on stage server turned on, causes xml-rpc message errors
[03:52:34] <rworth> also gnarf I did a clean install of stage. with a new wordpress_stage db to fix the site id mismatches that were tripping me up. Seems to be working ok now
[04:20:45] <rworth> ok, renamed stage db back to wordpress since puppet has that and overrides wp-config
[08:34:37] <nacin> rworth: WP_DEBUG was a suggestion only; it was left in wp-config.php rather than config.php so it could be removed at any time.
[08:34:49] <nacin> rworth: for stage, legacy, and prod, we should implement full PHP error logging.
