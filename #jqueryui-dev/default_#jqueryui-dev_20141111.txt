[04:35:28] <Omar-> hi
[04:36:30] <Omar-> will be there a similar method of .page("bindRemove") in .pagecontainer() widget?
[04:39:45] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof I have a tiny question
[04:40:10] <Omar-> arschmitz hi :)
[05:00:24] <arschmitz> Omar-: hi there will be something though it likely wont be public
[05:00:48] <arschmitz> Omar-: the only reason it was public in page was because it was called by another widget
[05:14:28] <Omar-> hi arschmitz
[05:15:18] <Omar-> because I think it should be added to .pagecontainer() as "remove" event isn't firing
[05:16:25] <Omar-> my question is what does "removeWithDependents" do exactly? I tried to figure out .jqmData("dependents") in both MPM and SPM but it returned undefined
[05:17:24] <Omar-> looking at the helpers.js, I also was unable to figure out what is being added as "dependents"
[05:17:52] <Omar-> just out of curiosity
[06:00:26] <lisa_deluca> jquery question.  so I I want to select all the children of some tag but I want to also print the tag itself, not just it's html how do you do that?  
[06:01:18] <lisa_deluca> tried $('body').children().html() but that'd return <h1>hello world</h1> when I really want <div><h1>hello world</h1></div>
[06:11:08] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: element.body.outerHTML
[06:11:20] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: gracias :)
[06:15:05] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: or if not body just $( "selector" )[ 0 ].outerHTML
[08:17:31] <Omar-> hi arschmitz
[08:18:24] <Omar-> lisa_deluca using .addBack() to add parent as well to collection. $("foo").html().addBack()
[08:21:39] <Omar-> .children() not .html() http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/vvav85Lu/
[10:22:39] <JakeG> hi
[10:23:02] <JakeG> Can someone help me with a jqm issue im having? :)
[10:28:42] <arschmitz> JakeG: use #jquery for support
[10:29:10] <arschmitz> JakeG: This channel is for the developers of jQuery UI and Mobile to discuss development of the libraries 
[10:31:23] <JakeG> Sorry Buddy ^^
[10:33:11] <arschmitz> JakeG: no problem
[11:30:36] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Ruffio closed issue #7835: Remove code that supports jQuery <1.8 02http://git.io/KQ8eyQ
[13:33:01] <Omar-> is gabriel_schulhof on vacation?
[13:33:25] <arschmitz> Omar-: no idea
[13:34:03] <Omar-> hi arschmitz
[13:34:35] <Omar-> arschmitz I have a question
[13:34:46] <Omar-> what does "removeWithDependents" do exactly? I tried to figure out .jqmData("dependents") in both MPM and SPM but it returned undefined
[13:35:00] <arschmitz> its for sub pages
[13:35:00] <Omar-> looking at the helpers.js, I also was unable to figure out what is being added as "dependents"
[13:35:03] <arschmitz> its not public
[13:35:05] <arschmitz> dont use it
[13:35:15] <Omar-> I know, I'm not using it
[13:35:22] <arschmitz> it wont exist for long
[13:35:33] <arschmitz> and there will be no replacment
[13:35:53] <Omar-> because I'm using .page("bindRemove") to remove pages in MPM
[13:36:10] <Omar-> I just wanted to know what that function exactly does.
[13:36:25] <Omar-> so .remove() is sufficient
[13:36:46] <arschmitz> Omar-: old nested lists created sub pages
[13:37:05] <arschmitz> Omar-: that ensured those pages were removed when the page that created them was removed
[13:38:04] <Omar-> ohh I see, I understand it now
[13:39:01] <Omar-> removing page from DOM and from history.stack doesn't remove it from browser's history
[13:39:12] <arschmitz> Omar-: nope
[13:39:24] <arschmitz> but that is unrelated
[13:39:38] <Omar-> do you think in the future you're going to offer removing a page from DOM and history?
[13:39:42] <arschmitz> no
[13:39:51] <Omar-> My bad, I've jumped to a new issue :)
[13:40:29] <Omar-> I know changeHash should be used when you don't want to update history
[13:46:38] <Omar-> btw arschmitz can your datepicker plugin without jQM?
[14:00:34] <arschmitz> Omar-: why would you do that?
[14:01:05] <arschmitz> Omar-: its just a wrapper on the UI datepicke
[14:01:15] <arschmitz> Omar-: to make it work with jqm
[14:01:22] <arschmitz> so if your not using jqm it serves no point
[14:05:29] <Omar-> arschmitz http://stackoverflow.com/q/26874908/1771795
[14:05:32] <Omar-> ;)
[14:05:57] <Omar-> for mobile development but no necessary jQM. responsive design
[14:06:26] <Omar-> maybe you should add an answer, since you're the author of the plugin.
[14:06:53] <arschmitz> Omar-: i need to update that plugin
[14:07:12] <arschmitz> i got it ready for a 1.0 and never finished the docs
[14:08:41] <Omar-> arschmitz I just check the demo, i guess it's not functioning as it should
[14:08:55] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/1375/edit
[14:09:12] <Omar-> datepicker on second input is also visible
[14:09:19] <Omar-> and the theme should be update
[14:09:38] <arschmitz> Omar-: master is not ready you should use the tag from the demos
[14:11:51] <arschmitz> Omar-: i made a css only version im trying to find
[14:15:34] <arschmitz> Omar-: http://cdn.rawgit.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile-datepicker-wrapper/master/index.html
[14:15:51] <arschmitz> master is actually fine it looks like 
[14:16:32] <Omar-> yup, it works just fine
[14:17:22] <arschmitz> Omar-: its just the docs and the themeroller i never finished 
[14:17:43] <Omar-> so it should work even without jQM since it's a wrapper only
[14:17:54] <Omar-> and can be used in responsive design
[14:17:54] <arschmitz> Omar-: well kinda
[14:18:02] <arschmitz> Omar-: you will need the jqm css
[14:18:13] <Omar-> aha
[14:18:14] <arschmitz> Omar-: and the css from this repo
[14:18:30] <arschmitz> and the js stuff wont work with out jqm
[14:18:44] <arschmitz> so you will need to use the actual ui widget and methods
[14:18:58] <Omar-> because it depends on jQM
[14:19:25] <Omar-> $.widget("mobile.date",{
[14:19:30] <arschmitz> Omar-: actually i take that back
[14:19:35] <Omar-> lol
[14:19:37] <arschmitz> Omar-: you dont need the mobile css i fixed that
[14:20:21] <Omar-> go ahead and help that poor guy ;)
[14:20:33] <Omar-> because I need you in another matter
[14:20:40] <Omar-> could you please check this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/06xa4uz5/
[14:21:18] <Omar-> I'm cloning a template page in DOM, inject it after first page and then navigate to it.
[14:21:35] <Omar-> hitting back button should bring you back to page1 not to that template page
[14:22:20] <arschmitz> i cant edit that
[14:22:45] <Omar-> edit what? the fiddle?
[14:23:24] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:23:29] <arschmitz> is it locked or something
[14:24:32] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/k3scmkg0/
[14:24:34] <Omar-> now?
[14:25:21] <arschmitz> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/06xa4uz5/3/
[14:30:43] <Omar-> arschmitz thanks, much better http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/06xa4uz5/4/
[14:30:43] <Omar-> but why was that happening?
[14:30:50] <arschmitz> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/ot6a3n79/1/
[14:32:25] <arschmitz> because of the data-role
[14:33:26] <Omar-> even better! arschmitz
[14:35:44] <Omar-> arschmitz on first run beforechange is firing twice return an object, is it correct or is it a bug?
[14:35:56] <Omar-> returning*
[15:12:42] <Omar-> arschmitz i know i'm bothering you
[15:13:06] <Omar-> but altering .toPage on beforechange is a bit tricky
[15:13:25] <Omar-> data.toPage = $(".selector") doesn't work
[15:13:38] <Omar-> data.toPage[0] = $(".selector")[0] does work
[15:13:50] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/Ltx2ac9z/
[15:14:58] <Omar-> in this demo data.toPage = $(".selector") works
[15:15:09] <Omar-> but I guess because its on first run

[15:28:58] <arschmitz> Omar-: im not sure what your talking about
[15:36:36] <Omar-> arschmitz on beforechange, if you want to change the value of .toPage
[15:36:50] <Omar-> when .toPage is an object (second call)
[15:37:04] <Omar-> data.toPage = $("new target") doesn't work
[15:37:15] <arschmitz> the fiddle you sent me works fine
[15:37:26] <Omar-> however, data.toPage[0] = $("new target")[0] works
[15:37:49] <arschmitz> Omar-: the fiddle you sent is the second call and is using the jquery object and works
[15:38:32] <arschmitz> Omar-: also this channel is not for support
[15:38:53] <Omar-> arschmitz http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/6vykf8md/ (toPage[0]) compare it to  http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/Ltx2ac9z/ (toPage)
[15:39:16] <Omar-> I know arschmitz I'm just trying to understand beforechange
[15:39:27] <arschmitz> Omar-: both work
[15:39:36] <arschmitz> Omar-: and thats fine however that is support
[15:39:43] <arschmitz> Omar-: and this channel is not for support
[15:39:51] <Omar-> ok
[15:39:59] <Omar-> thanks anyway :)
[15:40:29] <arschmitz> Omar-: both gabriel and i are in #jquery and are just as likely to answer there as here
[15:41:16] <Omar-> arschmitz ok, i'll ask it there
[15:41:37] <arschmitz> Omar-: im leaving for dinner though
[15:41:48] <Omar-> haha
[15:41:55] <Omar-> ok buddy, enjoy your meal :)
