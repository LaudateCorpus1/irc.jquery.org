[15:58:50] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: is there any plans on republishing old versions of jquery-ui on npm now that we're collaborators?
[15:59:17] <scott_gonzalez> Will old versions even work properly on npm?
[15:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think they will.
[15:59:25] <mikesherov_> 1.11 will
[15:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> At least not the intended way.
[15:59:50] <mikesherov_> 1.11 + webpack + npm works for sure
[16:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> So just publish 1.11.4 as is?
[16:00:18] <mikesherov_> I'm actively using it already, just from github
[16:00:22] <mikesherov_> but I'd rather load from npm
[16:00:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with that.
[16:00:32] <mikesherov_> because npm doesn't dedupe git urls
[16:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> Give it a day for other to way in?
[16:00:43] <mikesherov_> Up to you

[16:00:52] <b-ot> Correction, <scott_gonzalez> Give it a day for other to weigh in?
[16:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> I love that b-ot does this now.
[16:01:02] <mikesherov_> woah
[16:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> And it's so smart about it too.
[16:01:14] <mikesherov_> like it's not just the last message
[16:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[16:01:30] <mikesherov_> it'll find it anyware
[16:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> It looks for one that it can actually apply to.
[16:01:42] <mikesherov_> s/ware/where/
[16:01:42] <b-ot> Correction, <mikesherov_> it'll find it anywhere
[16:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> I've been wondering if you can correct someone else.
[16:01:51] <mikesherov_> lol
[16:02:00] <mikesherov_> s/correct/improve/
[16:02:00] <b-ot> Correction, <scott_gonzalez> I've been wondering if you can improve someone else.
[16:02:08] <scott_gonzalez> since

[16:02:57] <b-ot> Correction, <scott_gonzalez> I love that b-ot does this now.
[16:02:57] <mikesherov_> amazing
[16:03:08] * scott_gonzalez stops now
[16:03:44] <mikesherov_> publishing the entire 1.11 series would be ok too, but I only need 1.11.4 personally
[16:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> I don't *think* we have any regressions, so I'd prefer users just get the latest.
[16:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> That's the policy with download builder too. You can only get the latest patch for each version.
[16:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm fine publishing all the 1.11 versions too if people think that's better.
[16:08:31] <mikesherov_> well, it's better in that users will say ^1.11.0 anyway
[16:08:40] <mikesherov_> so both are likely the same
[16:09:15] <mikesherov_> but just the easiest conversion, should someone want to hardcode 1.11.0, would be to publish it
[16:09:19] <mikesherov_> I have no pref really
[18:56:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: mikesherov_: +1 for 1.11 on npm
[18:57:07] <arschmitz> i would do just 1.11.4 i think though
