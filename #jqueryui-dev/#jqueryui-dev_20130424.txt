[06:54:36] <petersendidit> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9251
[06:55:17] <petersendidit> Why can't people understand that if you do bad things you can't expect everything to work perfectly
[06:59:39] <tj_vantoll> I love how that starts with essentially "Ok I know what I'm doing is wrong, butâ€¦"
[07:08:24] <petersendidit> Yup
[07:08:53] <petersendidit> should have stop there and read what he just typed
[07:08:54] <scott_gonzalez> What a ridiculous ticket.
[07:09:26] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez hey... any reason I got permissions revoked on repo? Was trying to push up some bug fixes last night
[07:09:27] <b-ot> Dave_Stein: You have 2 new messages, use `read when you wish to read them.
[07:09:38] <scott_gonzalez> I love how he ends with "genuinely it is an issue."
[07:09:49] <Dave_Stein> `read
[07:09:50] <b-ot> Dave_Stein: From scott_gonzalez, 13h 16m ago: I removed your push access so that you would start sending PRs.
[07:09:55] <b-ot> Dave_Stein: From scott_gonzalez, 13h 15m ago: the way to check for a jQuery object is obj.jquery
[07:10:02] <Dave_Stein> oh well then therei s answer
[07:10:06] <Dave_Stein> b-ot was delayed
[07:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> b-ot wasn't delayed. You weren't here when I wrote that.
[07:10:40] <Dave_Stein> no i mean i just asked again right before b-ot let me know to hit read
[07:10:41] <Dave_Stein> ;)
[07:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> That's how b-ot works.
[07:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> He tells you about messages only after you type a message.
[07:11:14] <Dave_Stein> ha never realized
[07:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Can you sign the CLA?
[07:11:58] <scott_gonzalez> http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/
[07:11:59] <Dave_Stein> anyway if i work with mikesherov on tests and then need wait for a PR to be accepted for him to get my updates, that could become cumbersome. i know you get swamped frequently and don't review often when you are
[07:12:09] <Dave_Stein> sure thing
[07:12:13] <Dave_Stein> reading now 
[07:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> There is no bottleneck here.
[07:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov can't review your code any faster just because it's in a branch.
[07:13:19] <Dave_Stein> i didn't know that he does review it after i get more tests in or fix broken ones
[07:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> The PRs are necessary because all of your code needs to be reviewed.
[07:14:01] <scott_gonzalez> And you have a bad history of not replying to commit comments.
[07:15:18] <Dave_Stein> that's only because i don't work for a few weeks at a time ;) If you want me to be more actiev replying to comments to avoid needing to PR I can do that. I didn't think being slow would make PRs required. If PRs are required aside from that then I'll go make a fork
[07:15:46] <Dave_Stein> submitted the CLA
[07:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's not just being slow.
[07:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> Commit comments get lost. PR comments don't.
[07:16:39] <Dave_Stein> very well
[07:16:44] <Dave_Stein> we do the same thing here 
[07:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> And the history on draggable is really sloppy.
[07:16:53] <petersendidit> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9251 awesome jQuery UI now needs to be come a HTML validator too
[07:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> no comment
[07:21:00] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez downloading my fork now.. will have PR up shortly. Aside from that I noticed the scrolling tests were all failing in the suite , but would pass if i ran individually.i went crazy last night trying to see why cause i it definitely runs reset after each test for the scrollbar positions
[07:34:50] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez on that note, how often do you want PRs? I have fixes for containment but the scrolling tests are still bombing... do you want more often or for me to have bigger chunks?
[07:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> PRs should ideally be isolated changes.
[07:37:07] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise they'll sit forever during review.
[07:37:26] <Dave_Stein> ok cool i'll do the PR for my commit now then
[07:38:52] <petersendidit> do we want to keep the baseClasses and typeClasses vars in button now that we have this _classes stuff?
[07:39:21] <petersendidit> seems like some of the classes will be in the classes options and other won't
[07:39:42] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15DaveStein opened pull request #964: Draggable: Corrected containment detection and handles array (06interactions...06interactions)  02http://git.io/a-8JBw
[07:42:13] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez If I am going to make two changes to interactions like unit fixes, and then fleshing out more of an object I guess I'd need to make more branches so the PRs are separate? Otherwise another push will be same PR yeah?
[08:15:09] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: yeah
[08:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> PRs are branch-based
[08:15:53] <Dave_Stein> so essentially i should never do a PR from my fork of interactions... just of a branch off of that one so when you accept pr i pull upstream and get it
[08:15:57] <Dave_Stein> into my fork of interactions
[08:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[08:16:09] <Dave_Stein> ah ok
[08:16:28] <Dave_Stein> want to quickly accept my PR then and I'll do it the right way next time? :)
[08:16:49] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov are you around? I'm about to give up on these scrolling tests... in the whole suite the draggable moves 10 px. rerunning test makes it move the proper 50. I looked at containers, offsets, widths, heights of all related elements and have no idea why it would just stop in the whoel suite
[08:17:00] <Dave_Stein> i thought maybe one test was impacting the other but i dont see anything impacted
[08:29:19] <sgharms> meering is in .5 hour?
[08:29:46] <Dave_Stein> afaik
[08:30:31] <sgharms> thanks for the confirm. bbiab
[09:03:25] <sgharms> hi. i have updated my PR for menubar. i believe i have caught the bugs mentioned by jorn. also i have provided some more unit tests.  i have one problem thats mentioned in the PR where some help would be appreciated but, modulo that i'd like to try to land it.
[09:03:51] <sgharms> the pr, not the problem ;)
[09:05:02] <kborchers> sgharms: if you're looking for the meeting, join #jquery-meeting
[09:05:22] <sgharms> yijes!
[10:01:26] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15gmazzo opened pull request #965: datepicker's variants: monthpicker and yearpicker (06master...06master)  02http://git.io/OFdjPw
[11:37:04] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: Why are we testing an internal method? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/953/files#L0R49
[13:43:13] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: how do we want to handle the _classes stuff and datepicker? wait till rewrite?
[13:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:43:23] <petersendidit> Good
[13:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:57:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: finally broke down and wrote `git prr remote #`
[13:57:51] <gnarf> :)
[18:24:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: around?
[18:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: hey
[18:32:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: question â€¦ for the pointer event stuff, should i prevent the duplicate events that are fired? i.e. touch/click and MSPointerDown/click?
[18:33:13] <kborchers> problem is both get converted to pointerdown
[18:33:29] <kborchers> unless i ignore the click
[18:33:54] <kborchers> which i'm not happy with how i'm doing that right now â€¦ rethinking it and figured i would ask before spending more time
[18:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean? Click shouldn't trigger pointerdown.
[18:34:23] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, there will be a pointerdown that occurs before the click.
[18:35:03] <kborchers> hmm, i thought everything was to be converted to pointer events across all browsers so a click in chrome would be pointerdown
[18:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> click is click
[18:35:23] <scott_gonzalez> mousedown -> pointerdown
[18:35:23] <kborchers> sorry â€¦ mousedown
[18:35:55] <kborchers> i'm an idiot
[18:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> Are you asking about touchstart having compatibilty mouse events?
[18:36:28] <kborchers> yes
[18:36:32] <kborchers> sort of
[18:37:24] <kborchers> i think the main issue i've been having is that i think IE10 in win phone 8 is giving me a MSPointerDown followed my mousedown
[18:37:37] <kborchers> when i touch and don't release
[18:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, those are compatibility events
[18:38:38] <kborchers> so i should just ignore that, right?
[18:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you'll want to ignore the mouse event, the tricky part is knowing whether it was a comptibility event.
[18:39:31] <kborchers> right
[18:39:39] <kborchers> this is what i have now but i don't like it https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions-pointer/external/pointer.js#L99-L111
[18:39:57] <kborchers> thinking there could be a better way
[18:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, touch will create compatibility events as well.
[18:40:50] <kborchers> right, just saw that which spurred my pinging you :)
[18:43:50] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: any ideas on a better way to check for the compat events or should i just add touch to what i have and keep moving forward and we can think about it more later?
[18:43:51] <scott_gonzalez> You only need to worry about touch, actually.
[18:44:01] <kborchers> ?
[18:44:10] <scott_gonzalez> If you detect support for pointer or MSPointer, then you *only* listen to those.
[18:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise, you listen for both touch and mouse.
[18:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, for now don't even detect on pointer, only detect on MSPointer.
[18:45:12] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmmm, but I thought we were converting MSPointer to pointer as well since they have some quirks that don't follow the spec
[18:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but if MSPointer exists, never respond to mouse.
[18:45:39] <kborchers> oh, i see
[18:46:03] <kborchers> but then still use my method (or something better later) for touch's compat events?
[18:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> Only on a device that has Touch, but not Pointer, do you have to worry about compatibility events.
[18:46:45] <kborchers> like my iPhone which is where i just noticed it
[18:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> I forget how many variations there are for compatibility events from touch.
[18:47:36] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll need to figure that out.
[18:47:40] <kborchers> ok
[18:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> Probably just ping some of the mobile guys :-)
[18:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> But for now, just keep doing what you're doing.
[18:48:04] <scott_gonzalez> But update the code to use different paths for MSPointer and touch/mouse.
[18:48:12] <kborchers> sounds good
[18:49:22] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: after that update, basically i'm at the point where i am forking dave's test suite and making this special event with those tests. after that, i could probably use a thorough review
[18:49:37] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[18:50:15] <kborchers> this was actually a lot more work/research/spec reading than i thought it would be :D
[18:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> The MS Open Tech guys have been hounding us about hand.js
[18:52:40] <kborchers> yeah, i've seen those e-mails
[18:53:16] <kborchers> the more i look at hand.js the more i'm not a big fan â€¦ i think this is a better solution, at least for us but i may be a bit biased :)
[18:58:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's why we're doing the research :-)
[19:03:57] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez If you're around any ideas why I still might be getting the grunt-wordpress version mismatch issue?
[19:10:58] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: what does `git describe` show for jquery-wp-content?
[19:11:27] <tj_vantoll> v2.4.1-8-g0d58c34
[19:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[19:12:17] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder why it doesn't show v2.4.4
[19:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, that's not the problem, since it's up-to-date.
[19:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> And that's definitely the code being used for your local sites?
[19:13:47] <tj_vantoll> I believe so.  I know I only have one repo for that.
[19:14:19] <scott_gonzalez> If you open mu-plugins/grunt-wordpress.php what does it say on line 7?
[19:15:07] <tj_vantoll> define( 'GW_VERSION', '1.0.7' );
[19:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> hm...
[19:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> So it should be working then.
[19:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> screen share?
[19:16:50] <tj_vantoll> For jquery-wp-content I shouldn't have to do anything other than have the repo up to date correct?
[19:16:57] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[19:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> No npm, no grunt, etc.
[19:17:30] <tj_vantoll> Sure.  Yeah on my api.jqueryui.com repo I axed node_modules and npm installed it fresh so I'm out of ideas.
[19:17:56] <tj_vantoll> I could try a separate site and see if I get the same thing.
[19:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[19:18:38] <scott_gonzalez> I hope you do get the same thing, otherwise there's something crazy with your setup :-P
[19:18:44] <tj_vantoll> Same error on contribute.jquery.org
[19:19:01] <tj_vantoll> Yeah it's not picking up on the updated jquery-wp-content for some reason.
[19:19:57] <scott_gonzalez> Apache or nginx?
[19:20:01] <tj_vantoll> apache
[19:20:46] <tj_vantoll> Wait so, I have a sites folder.
[19:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> What happens if you put `echo "hello";` in grunt-wordpress.php.
[19:21:34] <tj_vantoll> Ok so I might be doing something stupid.
[19:21:46] <tj_vantoll> jquery-wp-content
[19:21:50] <tj_vantoll> Ah
[19:22:15] <tj_vantoll> api.jqueryui.com
[19:22:15] <tj_vantoll> jquery-wp-content
[19:22:15] <tj_vantoll> sites
[19:22:15] <tj_vantoll>     jquery-wp-content
[19:23:14] <tj_vantoll> Still wrapping my head around this setup but am I supposed to have a jquery-wp-content folder within the sites folder?
[19:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> You should have a WordPress install, and jquery-wp-content should be inside that.
[19:25:19] <tj_vantoll> Ok I think I duplicated something I shouldn't have when setting this up.
[19:26:42] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I'm good.
[19:27:15] <tj_vantoll> Sorry about that.  I did have two jquery-wp-content repos but one was hidden.
[19:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[19:28:40] <scott_gonzalez> So you've got it working now?
[19:31:16] <tj_vantoll> wordpress-validate passed now I'm getting the whole directory not writable error.
[19:31:31] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[19:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> chown or chmod the directory?
[19:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> You should have write permission on the whole WordPress install.
[19:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> At least that's how I have it setup.
[19:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> I don't use the sites directory.
[19:33:18] <scott_gonzalez> I just have a clone of the WP repo in ~/Projects.
[19:34:43] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I named my Wordpress install folder "sites" for some reason.  Apparently my original setup of this wasn't my finest moment.
[19:35:56] <scott_gonzalez> h
[19:36:14] <scott_gonzalez> OS X ships with a Sites directory for the default Apache install.
[19:36:18] <scott_gonzalez> So I thought that's what you were using.
[19:37:08] <tj_vantoll> No I've got a custom Apache install that fights with the default one occasionally.  Good times.
[19:37:11] <tj_vantoll> SUCCESS!
[19:37:48] <tj_vantoll> I made that harder than it should've been.  Thanks for the help.
[19:43:14] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[20:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG, I hate coffeescript so much.
[20:20:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: agree â€¦ anything specific?
[20:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> The leveldb node module has no docs.
[20:20:58] <scott_gonzalez> And it's written in cs
[20:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/my8bird/node-leveldb/blob/master/src/coffee/leveldb/handle.coffee
[20:21:52] <kborchers> :/
[20:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> So my choices are: Read Google's C++ docs or read the CoffeeScript source...
[20:25:11] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i would probably just choose http://goo.gl/Hr2y9
[20:25:28] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[20:27:42] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I've got it working :-)
[20:28:12] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be nice if a new release come out.
[20:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> He implemented openSync() 3 months ago.
[20:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> But the latest version is 8 months old.
[20:30:59] <kborchers> ouch
[20:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> oh well, at least I'm finally playing with a few modules I've been wanting to play with for a while.
[20:32:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm using leveldb and express for the first time.
[20:33:42] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, time for bed.
