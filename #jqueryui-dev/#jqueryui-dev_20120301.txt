[02:52:16] <rworth> theBrettman: welcome :)
[03:01:45] <theBrettman> thx
[03:02:11] <theBrettman> is it ok to just fork stuff like say the contextmenu demo or do you have to be assigned first?
[03:04:15] <rworth> do you mean fork like create a github fork or fork like split one demo into two demos?
[03:04:31] <theBrettman> github fork
[03:04:53] <rworth> well, you should have a fork since you said you wanna help out, so yes that's ok :)
[03:06:22] <theBrettman> ok, cool. I'm about done with it. the contextmenu demo was missing and it was a button-click one anyway. you get 404 when you go to look at it. I found a copy in the tree for 1.9m2 and forked it
[03:06:34] <rworth> nice
[03:07:00] <theBrettman> it works on right-click instead. my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/PawEs/
[03:07:37] <theBrettman> but if u click a parent li, it outputs the parent and all children
[03:08:07] <theBrettman> *select
[03:10:19] <rworth> http://jsfiddle.net/fhsyn/
[03:11:31] <theBrettman> wow, what a chain, lol
[03:12:34] <theBrettman> why do I think there's a better way though?
[03:12:53] <gnarf> ui.item.find(">a").text()
[03:12:55] <theBrettman> do submenu's always do that?
[03:13:03] <theBrettman> or is that something from menu()?
[03:13:12] <theBrettman> oh, I don't mean that
[03:13:15] <gnarf> ui.item == the li
[03:13:23] <theBrettman> oh
[03:13:31] <theBrettman> so it's item
[03:14:48] <theBrettman> what if I used event.target.innerText?
[03:15:12] <theBrettman> or $(this).text()
[03:16:03] <gnarf> ?tias
[03:16:15] <gnarf> but i guessing that the ui.item is the li
[03:16:26] <gnarf> so - text will grab everything in the ul also
[03:16:28] <theBrettman> that didn't work either
[03:16:43] <rworth> the li contains its children, no way around that
[03:16:46] <gnarf> ui.item.children("a").text() will prolly grab it
[03:16:59] <theBrettman> ah
[03:17:00] <gnarf> without clone().find("ul").remove().end()
[03:17:04] <theBrettman> forgot about the a
[03:17:04] <rworth> yeah
[03:18:26] <theBrettman> cool
[03:18:55] <theBrettman> all I need now is to focus after right-click
[03:19:23] <theBrettman> I tried menu('focus') but it didn't work
[03:19:59] <gnarf> focus the menu for up/down/left/right ?
[03:19:59] <rworth> menu.trigger("focus")
[03:20:04] <gnarf> .menu().focus() ?
[03:20:04] <theBrettman> yes
[03:20:10] <theBrettman> it's a different focus
[03:20:17] <theBrettman> it's menu's focus
[03:20:23] <theBrettman> it adds classes
[03:20:44] <gnarf> just adding a .focus() to the chain seems to handle it fine
[03:20:57] <theBrettman> it puts focus but doesn't change the class
[03:21:02] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/PawEs/3/
[03:21:10] <theBrettman> I thought all I had to do was calll menu('focus')
[03:21:23] <rworth> that puts the focus on the first item, I think that's a bug
[03:21:51] <theBrettman> oh
[03:21:54] <rworth> it is, comparing to OS context menus
[03:22:08] <theBrettman> so it should be menu('focus') then?
[03:22:30] <theBrettman> actually, I think that breaks something
[03:22:32] <gnarf> that's one for kborchers prolly
[03:22:43] <gnarf> he might remember the tricky parts of menu focus
[03:23:07] <theBrettman> let's hope, lol
[03:23:19] <rworth> for now, .menu().focus() is better than nothing
[03:23:28] <rworth> just add a TODO in a comment above it
[03:23:31] <theBrettman> should I make an extension for contextmenu?
[03:23:35] <rworth> and add an open issue to the menu wiki page
[03:24:39] <theBrettman> I think menu.focus() focuses on the last element and I have to use li:first-child
[03:25:12] <rworth> got it .menu().focus().menu("blur")
[03:25:43] <rworth> from blur description in the spec: "Useful when reopening a menu which had previously an item focused"
[03:26:26] <rworth> no item should be focused when the menu opens
[03:26:36] <rworth> hence the blur after the focus
[03:26:40] <theBrettman> that's for if something was focused in the first place
[03:27:06] <rworth> but calling .focus() is focusing the first item, and we don't want that
[03:27:13] <theBrettman> right now, u have to tab after right-click to use the keyboard but then, if you're using contextmenu, you don't really use the keyboard...
[03:27:48] <rworth> native context menus allow you to use the keyboard in this way, and they also don't focus any items on open
[03:28:15] <theBrettman> well I could add an if so that you can determine if anything was focused? and if not, then it focuses on the first item?
[03:28:21] <rworth> also, it's not useful to think of the keyboard and mouse being used in isolation
[03:28:24] <theBrettman> ok
[03:28:25] <theBrettman> good
[03:28:37] <theBrettman> and I don't know about application key support
[03:28:43] <rworth> no need, just call .menu().focus().menu("blur") and it's all good
[03:28:56] <theBrettman> not sure I should bother with it when it's not covered by contextmenu event
[03:29:02] <theBrettman> cool
[03:29:03] <rworth> when the menu open it gets the focus, without focusing any menu item
[03:29:04] <theBrettman> done
[03:29:14] <rworth> gotta run, lata
[03:29:22] <theBrettman> l8r
[03:32:57] <theBrettman> gnarf, think I should enable alt+tab to fire contextmenu?
[03:33:30] <theBrettman> or I could just use the application button I guess...
[03:33:47] <theBrettman> oh, not alt+tab, ctrl+alt I mean
[03:36:28] <gnarf> ?
[03:37:01] <theBrettman> so you can open it with keyboard
[03:37:34] <gnarf> context menu's are usually when you click on something specific
[03:37:52] <gnarf> so - i don't think there should be a keyb way to open it
[03:38:13] <gnarf> can you for instance, open the context menu for the browser by pressing a key while highlighting something
[03:38:23] <theBrettman> the guy that posted on the jquery blog mentioned it... and that's mentioned on the menu dev page
[03:38:41] <gnarf> if so - browser will prolly fire oncontextmenu anyway
[03:38:42] <theBrettman> it's not for highliting?
[03:39:04] <theBrettman> I can get the keycode
[03:39:20] <gnarf> tbh - its a demo
[03:39:25] <gnarf> keep it simple
[03:39:25] <gnarf> ;)
[03:39:34] <theBrettman> lol. you know someone is gonna ask though!
[03:39:53] <theBrettman> it will save #jquery some effort
[03:40:26] <theBrettman> then again, it might make the demo a bit complicated to read
[03:40:58] <theBrettman> even though it already kind of is...
[03:43:25] <gnarf> afk a bit
[03:44:13] <SlinQ> windows has a context menu key
[03:44:18] <SlinQ> well, all windows keyboards
[03:44:32] <SlinQ> you should be able to tab to the control, then press the context menu key to open the context menu
[03:45:39] <gnarf> SlinQ: i assume that triggers "oncontextmenu" ?
[03:46:06] <theBrettman> I'm not gonna worry about it. mac doesn't have the button anyway
[03:46:28] <theBrettman> I'm sure that's why it's not included in the contextmenu event in the first place
[03:46:45] <theBrettman> it's actually an application button
[03:47:24] <SlinQ> ye the key does trigger the oncontextmenu event
[03:48:15] <theBrettman> then why wouldn't it work when I use on('contextmenu')?
[03:48:28] <theBrettman> http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/PawEs/2/
[03:49:08] <SlinQ> it works for me in rekonq
[03:49:25] <SlinQ> if i put the focus in there then press the context menu key on my keyboard, it opens the context menu
[03:49:38] <theBrettman> focus where?
[03:49:51] <theBrettman> it does!
[03:49:53] <theBrettman> nice!
[03:49:55] <theBrettman> cool
[03:50:14] <theBrettman> stick a fork in it, this demo is done!
[03:50:32] <theBrettman> my first contribution :)
[03:50:37] <SlinQ> congrats :)
[03:50:55] <gnarf> theBrettman: now you need to get it into a pull request :)
[03:51:03] <theBrettman> how?
[03:51:17] <gnarf> theBrettman: lemme go afk for a few for a smoke then ill try to walk you through it ;)
[03:51:57] <theBrettman> cool
[03:59:00] <gnarf> so
[03:59:07] <gnarf> i assume you've cloned your fork?
[03:59:12] <gnarf> on your local machine?
[03:59:30] <theBrettman> I edited it on git
[03:59:45] <theBrettman> should I clone it?
[03:59:48] <gnarf> theBrettman: you're going to want a local clone
[03:59:56] <theBrettman> ok
[04:00:22] <theBrettman> I will clone after
[04:00:58] <gnarf> a) http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[04:01:54] <theBrettman> oh, I wasn't gonna use trontastic in the demo
[04:02:21] <theBrettman> oh, hint
[04:02:55] <gnarf> read the section on commiting & pull requests here: http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved
[04:03:04] <gnarf> although you can skip "file a bug"
[04:03:07] <gnarf> for this
[04:03:11] <gnarf> since its not a bug
[04:03:17] <gnarf> we track new development on the wiki
[04:03:18] <theBrettman> ok
[04:03:34] <gnarf> http://docs.jquery.com/Tips_for_jQuery_Bug_Patching
[04:03:44] <theBrettman> you think I need some comments in there?
[04:03:51] <gnarf> probably
[04:03:57] <gnarf> so the general idea
[04:04:01] <theBrettman> the demo I forked didn't, lol
[04:05:06] <gnarf> you checkout master - pull it up to date - checkout a new branch ( i.e. git co -b contextmenu-demo ) - then push your branch to your fork on github ( git push origin contextmenu-demo ) and then file a pull
[04:05:49] <gnarf> from there - we can place some comments on it - discuss it, etc
[04:06:06] <theBrettman> ok
[04:07:39] <SlinQ> To anyone: I'm using the new selectmenu UI widget (http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu), but it's got some problems with my 'responsive' design - in other words, I can't specify the width as a percentage
[04:08:13] <SlinQ> i am likely to need to modify the widget to make this work, would this be worth doing in a fork and issuing a pull request?
[04:09:45] <theBrettman> tab 4spcs or 8?
[04:09:50] <gnarf> SlinQ: perhaps
[04:09:53] <gnarf> theBrettman: tabs
[04:10:11] <gnarf> theBrettman: you can set em however deep you like em - i personally use 4
[04:10:21] <gnarf> theBrettman: but all indentation should be tabs, not spaces
[04:11:33] <gnarf> ?hug
[04:11:33] <bot-t> http://ahugfromtaylorswift.com/
[04:15:54] <theBrettman> I submitted it and it says send pull request on a button on the next page
[04:16:04] <theBrettman> and has a form for me to fill out
[04:16:11] <theBrettman> it says patch 1 for the title
[04:17:22] <theBrettman> and your hug never loads
[04:21:00] * gnarf hugs bot-t
[04:21:01] * bot-t hugs gnarf back
[04:21:19] <gnarf> theBrettman: you should really do this from a local fork
[04:21:23] <gnarf> not edit on github
[04:21:25] <gnarf> trust me :)
[04:22:36] <theBrettman> I'm not sure if it committed or what
[04:23:06] <gnarf> it saved it on a branch it made called "patch-1"
[04:23:32] <theBrettman> ok
[04:33:00] <theBrettman> is that branch ok?
[04:33:28] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 6 new commits to data-naming: http://git.io/HGvhgg
[04:33:28] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/data-naming] Update data naming for Accordion. Partial fix for #7810 - Jörn Zaefferer
[04:33:28] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/data-naming] Slider: Whitespace cleanup - Jörn Zaefferer
[04:33:28] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/data-naming] Update data naming for Slider. Partial fix for #7810 - Jörn Zaefferer
[04:33:48] <gnarf> what branch?
[04:33:56] <theBrettman> patch-1
[04:34:05] <gnarf> patch-1 is on your fork
[04:34:12] <theBrettman> ok
[04:34:19] <gnarf> i can't see it unless i know your fork
[04:34:21] <gnarf> just give me an url
[04:34:22] <gnarf> :)
[04:34:23] <theBrettman> then I just need to checkout
[04:35:27] <theBrettman> didn't really mean to clone all of ui but that's ok
[04:36:08] <gnarf> you have to
[04:36:12] <gnarf> thats how git works
[04:36:21] <gnarf> you have your own copy of the jquery-ui repo ow
[04:36:22] <gnarf> now
[04:37:12] <theBrettman> can't figure out what to checkout
[04:37:22] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to data-naming: http://git.io/DhUxVw
[04:37:22] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/data-naming] Merge branch 'master' into data-naming - Jörn Zaefferer
[04:37:25] <theBrettman> it's demos/menu/contextmenu.html
[04:37:43] <gnarf> theBrettman: step 1) make sure you have the "upstream" remote
[04:38:12] <theBrettman> I'm a noob to git...
[04:38:23] <theBrettman> I haven't rtfm yet, lol
[04:38:37] <gnarf> git remote add upstream git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git
[04:38:39] <gnarf> oops
[04:38:40] <gnarf> sorry
[04:38:43] <gnarf> git remote add upstream git://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui.git
[04:38:49] <gnarf> git checkout master
[04:38:52] <gnarf> git pull upstream master
[04:39:00] <gnarf> git checkout -b contextmenu-demo
[04:39:05] <gnarf> make your change
[04:39:11] <gnarf> git add demos/menu/contextmenu.html
[04:39:13] <gnarf> git commit
[04:39:21] <gnarf> git push origin contextmenu-demo
[04:39:34] <gnarf> then it should land in the "contextmenu-demo" branch on github
[04:39:59] <theBrettman> it sayd it's not a git repository
[04:40:05] <gnarf> did you clone it?
[04:40:09] <theBrettman> yes
[04:40:15] <gnarf> how?
[04:40:17] <gnarf> git clone ?
[04:40:33] <theBrettman> I cloned mine
[04:40:43] <theBrettman> git clone git@github.com:theBrettman/jquery-ui.git
[04:40:46] <theBrettman> oops
[04:40:49] <theBrettman> wrong one
[04:40:58] <theBrettman> git clone git://github.com/theBrettman/jquery-ui.git
[04:41:13] <gnarf> cd jquery-ui
[04:41:29] <gnarf> git remote add upstream git://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui.git
[04:41:43] <gnarf> so when you clone a repo
[04:41:47] <theBrettman> oh wow, I didn't know git puts it in the dir you're in!
[04:41:49] <theBrettman> damn
[04:42:03] <theBrettman> I thought git put everything in a git dir on my computer
[04:42:05] <gnarf> its automatically set to "origin"
[04:42:23] <gnarf> git is not like svn
[04:42:24] <theBrettman> which I don't remember where I set it but I think in ~/
[04:42:42] <gnarf> with git - EVERYONE has their own copy of the repo
[04:42:44] <theBrettman> that's probably not the first clone in a random dir then, lol
[04:42:52] <theBrettman> guess I will have to move it
[04:42:53] <gnarf> you can just mv the directory wherever
[04:43:08] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to data-naming: http://git.io/xlYFXA
[04:43:08] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/data-naming] Update data naming for Effects. Partial fix for #7810 - Jörn Zaefferer
[04:43:09] <gnarf> it stores all the git info in jquery-ui/.git
[04:43:26] <theBrettman> that's good
[04:44:03] <gnarf> so - you have a "local" repo
[04:44:08] <gnarf> and then you have "remotes"
[04:44:10] <theBrettman> oops, now I grapped the wrong link you oopsed on earlier
[04:44:21] <theBrettman> do I have to go out of that mode somehow?
[04:44:25] <gnarf> it shouldn't let you add jquery.git
[04:44:28] <theBrettman> the git remote add upstream?
[04:44:34] <theBrettman> hm
[04:44:35] <gnarf> it should error
[04:44:39] <theBrettman> it didn't
[04:44:55] <theBrettman> I know I've never cloned jquery
[04:45:24] <gnarf> git remote set-url upstream git://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui.git
[04:45:50] <theBrettman> unless it got cloned with javascriptMVC stuff...
[04:46:07] <gnarf> if you do git remote -v show
[04:46:13] <gnarf> you should see origin and upstream
[04:46:25] <theBrettman> ok
[04:46:25] <gnarf> origin = github.com/theBrettman -- upstream = github.com/jquery
[04:46:56] <gnarf> theBrettman: that done?
[04:47:01] <theBrettman> yes
[04:47:08] <gnarf> once you've done this, you wont need to add the remote again - its just done
[04:47:09] <gnarf> so now
[04:47:12] <gnarf> you can "pull"
[04:47:19] <theBrettman> ok, I'll do the rest
[04:47:22] <gnarf> git checkout master (just to make sure)
[04:47:30] <gnarf> git pull upstream master
[04:47:44] <gnarf> that should get all the newest changes that jzaefferer just made ;)
[04:47:54] <theBrettman> it says already up to date
[04:48:04] <gnarf> upstream ?
[04:48:10] <gnarf> oh he did that on a branch
[04:48:11] <gnarf> nvm
[04:48:21] <gnarf> so your up to date
[04:48:22] <gnarf> yay!
[04:48:25] <gnarf> thats a good thing
[04:48:35] <gnarf> git checkout -b contextmenu-demo
[04:48:51] <gnarf> that will checkout a new branch named contextmenu-demo based on the current branch (master)
[04:48:52] <theBrettman> ok
[04:49:02] <gnarf> now - make your change
[04:49:05] <theBrettman> it says switched to new branch
[04:49:15] <theBrettman> make my change?
[04:49:23] <gnarf> add your contextmenu demo
[04:49:41] <theBrettman> is there a way to get that from what I already did on my fork?
[04:50:55] <gnarf> https://github.com/theBrettman/jquery-ui/commit/89c603f08bc18e5f647dcd687a3201b24d0e4a0d
[04:50:56] <theBrettman> oh, I already made the changes
[04:50:56] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by theBrettman (35m, 47s ago): Update demos/menu/contextmenu.html
[04:50:57] <gnarf> is that it?
[04:51:12] <theBrettman> yes
[04:51:28] <gnarf> git cherry-pick 89c603f08bc18e5f647dcd687a3201b24d0e4a0d
[04:51:35] <gnarf> git merge origin/patch-1
[04:51:37] <gnarf> take your pick
[04:52:04] <theBrettman> got an error with the first
[04:52:14] <gnarf> git fetch origin
[04:52:24] <gnarf> then you should be able to cherry-pick that commit
[04:52:39] <gnarf> or merge with origin/patch-1
[04:52:46] <theBrettman> it says I unmerged files now
[04:52:56] <theBrettman> both get fatal
[04:53:10] <gnarf> theBrettman: git status ?
[04:53:19] <gnarf> feel free to spam me in pm with the result

[04:54:20] <gnarf> did you remove it? :)

[04:54:45] <gnarf> (you prolly don't have the "co" alias)
[04:54:58] <theBrettman> I think since I edited it while making the fork online that it thinks there's no changes
[04:55:09] <theBrettman> cuz I haven't changed my copy
[04:55:16] <theBrettman> idk
[04:55:21] <gnarf> that commit doesn't exist in your "master" branch
[04:55:28] <gnarf> it only exists in the patch-1 branch
[04:55:39] <gnarf> read up on some of those links a pasted earlier
[04:55:53] <gnarf> http://docs.jquery.com/Tips_for_jQuery_Bug_Patching this one in particular has some good stuff
[04:57:04] <theBrettman> idr if I have NodeJS yet but I think I do
[04:57:16] <gnarf> its not that important for this change
[04:57:18] <gnarf> since its a demo
[04:57:20] <gnarf> not core code
[04:57:35] <theBrettman> I didn't know jquery used node
[04:57:49] <gnarf> we use it in our build chain
[04:58:26] <gnarf> uglify uses it
[04:58:28] <gnarf> :)
[04:58:36] <theBrettman> cool
[04:59:00] <theBrettman> I'm sure it will be using a lot more modules in the future
[04:59:51] <theBrettman> ok, so where am I at in all this? I scanned that and I don't see anything on it
[05:00:07] <theBrettman> or I'm confused cuz it's for bugs
[05:00:11] <theBrettman> *tickets
[05:00:24] <theBrettman> was there a ticket for this?
[05:01:25] <theBrettman> oh, I didn't do git checkout master
[05:01:57] <theBrettman> cuz you were telling me commands and that one got skipped but you included it the first time so I just did what u said...
[05:02:35] <theBrettman> how do I get out of this so I can do that?
[05:08:16] <gnarf> you can actually git reset --hard if your sure you aren't gonna lose any local changes
[05:08:31] <gnarf> that will bring you to the "HEAD"
[05:08:39] <gnarf> HEAD = the top commit on the current branch
[05:08:54] <gnarf> it will undo all changes to local files, etc
[05:09:10] <gnarf> you should still be in your contextmenu branch
[05:09:14] <theBrettman> so now I can git checkout master?
[05:09:26] <gnarf> you based the contextmenu branch off master
[05:09:28] <gnarf> so thats fine
[05:10:03] <gnarf> i would almost suggest just taking https://github.com/theBrettman/jquery-ui/blob/89c603f08bc18e5f647dcd687a3201b24d0e4a0d/demos/menu/contextmenu.html
[05:10:30] <gnarf> and adding it to your repo in the correct location
[05:10:41] <gnarf> and then make sure to test it
[05:10:49] <gnarf> cuz all the jquery.js files are wrong ;)
[05:10:54] <gnarf> compare to the other demos
[05:10:55] <gnarf> etc
[05:11:20] <theBrettman> oh, I didn't think to check the js files
[05:11:25] <gnarf> you should really setup jquery-ui as a host under a local web server also so you can test on your local
[05:11:59] <theBrettman> so I should move it to /srv/www/htdocs?
[05:13:15] <theBrettman> do I git pull upstream master now?
[05:13:38] <theBrettman> oh wait, gotta fix files first
[05:13:43] <theBrettman> *file
[05:14:07] <theBrettman> do you know anything about cloud9 editor?
[05:14:22] <gnarf> nope
[05:14:23] <theBrettman> I'm not liking aptana
[05:14:25] <gnarf> i use textmate
[05:14:29] <theBrettman> or eclipse
[05:14:37] <gnarf> lots of people around here are macvim fans
[05:14:40] <theBrettman> I could use vim but not got the hang of it yet
[05:15:14] <theBrettman> I like cloud9 cuz it's in the cloud
[05:15:29] <theBrettman> and it has git integration
[05:15:35] <theBrettman> and runs on node.js
[05:15:45] <theBrettman> and it's a chrome app, lol
[05:17:16] <theBrettman> there might even be an option to set the editor up like vim, wouldn't surprise me...
[05:17:55] <theBrettman> I guess I'd better learn git. I've never used any subversion stuff before
[05:23:07] <gnarf> need to take off - ill see ya later
[05:23:18] <gnarf> been working for like 16 hours today
[05:23:34] <jzaefferer> theBrettman: I can recommend Sublime Text 2
[05:23:38] <gnarf> had a split shift - wanted the overnight hours to swap out some servers
[05:23:51] <jzaefferer> gnarf: dude!
[05:23:59] <jzaefferer> get some rest :-)
[05:24:26] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah - badly needed - but i wanna stay up for a few more hours in case something catches on fire after the servers i replaced last night
[05:25:08] <gnarf> trying to get rid of all the old debian lenny boxes
[05:25:19] <gnarf> replace em with squeeze
[05:25:42] <gnarf> zanywwayz
[05:25:53] <gnarf> zzzzz from irc ;)
[05:28:42] <theBrettman> oh. I forgot, contextmenu.html isn't in master
[05:28:55] <theBrettman> I got it from the milestone
[05:30:25] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to data-naming: http://git.io/CuyY3Q
[05:30:25] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/data-naming] Update data naming for Widget, including backwards compability. Updated tests and added one for the custom expression. Partial fix for #7810 - Jörn Zaefferer
[05:32:01] <theBrettman> jzaefferer, wanna help guide me thru git to make my first ever contribution? I already edited the files but I don't really know what I'm doing with git
[05:36:26] <theBrettman> IIIIIIII ain't got no bot-t! lol

[05:40:47] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/data-naming] Autocomplete: Add removal TODOs for #7810 - Jörn Zaefferer
[05:42:01] <jzaefferer> theBrettman: the contextmenu demo is in the menubar branch, as we pulled out both menubar and popup into that
[05:43:05] <theBrettman> so what do I do with the demo I made?
[05:43:23] <theBrettman> I'm just learning git
[05:43:31] <theBrettman> reading the manual now
[05:45:52] <theBrettman> my example is different. that demo is on button click. this is on contextmenu
[05:48:32] <SlinQ> use github to fork the repo you're trying to change
[05:48:45] <SlinQ> clone your forked repo, apply your patch to it
[05:48:48] <SlinQ> commit, push
[05:48:52] <SlinQ> then issue a pull request
[05:49:17] <SlinQ> http://book.git-scm.com/index.html
[05:49:20] <theBrettman> is that gonna make someone who's working on it mad? I see they're using popup...
[05:49:30] <theBrettman> I don't even know what popup is yet, lol
[05:49:49] <theBrettman> I don't know if this should be a seperate demo or what?
[05:50:10] <SlinQ> a pull request is a request for them to merge your code
[05:50:12] <theBrettman> I don't understand why you would activate a context menu with a button either
[05:50:13] <SlinQ> they can deny it
[05:50:18] <theBrettman> ok
[05:50:35] <theBrettman> I guess it won't be hard to do this then
[05:50:47] <theBrettman> oh wait, is that branch in what I cloned?
[05:51:12] <theBrettman> nvm
[05:51:14] <SlinQ> git branch will tell you what branches you have
[05:52:02] <theBrettman> I'm gonna finish reading the manual and then I will understand everything. or you could tell me how to fork from command line, lol
[05:52:11] <SlinQ> fork from github
[05:52:15] <SlinQ> not the commandline
[05:52:19] <theBrettman> ok
[05:53:00] <SlinQ> you may find a tool like tortoisegit, gitk or giggle useful
[05:53:16] <SlinQ> tortoisegit if you're on windows, the other two if you're on linux
[05:53:27] <theBrettman> I think I wanna do it on cloud9
[05:58:20] <theBrettman> where's the project page for popup so I can see if I should use it or not...
[05:59:03] <SlinQ> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/39506002/Popup ?
[05:59:15] <theBrettman> thx
[06:02:01] <guy> Super simple question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9517519/get-element-selector-in-the-event-stop
[06:02:19] <rworth> guy: #jquery for support
[06:02:27] <guy> That's jquery-ui question
[06:02:28] <rworth> this channel is for development of jQuery UI itself
[06:02:32] <rworth> even so
[06:02:46] <rworth> this channel is if you are hacking on jQuery UI, not using it
[06:02:50] <guy> rworth: Well, this is not covered in the docs. So, involves development?
[06:03:01] <rworth> all using questions, whether jquery or UI or mobile are in #jquery
[06:03:57] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to data-naming: http://git.io/S9SUKQ
[06:03:57] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/data-naming] Update Widget data naming/usage. Remove unnecessary fallbacks, update .removeData to use full name. - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:04:43] <rworth> guy: I'm happy to answer there. It's ok to find bugs and fix them in the course of discussing a question in #jquery
[06:05:57] <guy> rworth: This question was asked both in #jquery and #jquery-ui
[06:06:21] <jzaefferer> theBrettman: right clicking and the web don't generally go well together. And there's plenty examples of popups on left click on the web. So that demo should be fine.
[06:06:28] <jzaefferer> theBrettman: There's bigger fish to fry
[06:07:12] <theBrettman> if someone wants it for a web app, why would they want to click a button?
[06:07:41] <SlinQ> I'm using right-click context menus in my apps
[06:07:47] <theBrettman> I basically did this for myself. I'm making an editor and I figure, others will want the example and I may want it later myself...
[06:07:55] <rworth> guy: if you wouldn't mind asking again in #jquery (since I missed it), as I said, I'm happy to discuss it there
[06:08:34] <theBrettman> so I figured, might as well contribute
[06:13:41] <rworth> your contribution is welcome. The area you decide to contribute in can largely determine how quickly/soon someone can review it
[06:13:53] <rworth> this is jzaefferer's point
[06:14:29] <rworth> all depends on whether you want to do something that doesn't happen to be one of our top priorities or whether you're interested in jumping in and helping with all the most important work we're all focused on atm
[06:15:04] <rworth> in the former, a pull request might sit for months until we pick that branch back up; the latter might be hours or days
[06:15:13] <jzaefferer> In this case, I likely wouldn't accept the contribution. Just because someone wants to use contextmenu events for their popups, doesn't mean we want to promote that approach. jQuery UI makes a lot of UX descision and promotion.
[06:15:31] <theBrettman> ok
[06:15:50] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to data-naming: http://git.io/4uT3uQ
[06:15:50] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/data-naming] Remove both widgetName and widgetFullName data - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:15:50] <theBrettman> I guess I just wasted a day on that. ohwell...
[06:16:23] <theBrettman> I will make a blog post of the example instead. I'm sure it will be easy for people to google
[06:16:31] <rworth> great idea
[06:16:33] <theBrettman> not a complete waste :)
[06:16:47] <rworth> plus, you got set up with a fork and started learning git :)
[06:16:48] <theBrettman> back to my project, l81
[06:16:56] <theBrettman> yeah
[06:17:52] <jzaefferer> theBrettman: yeah, that makes sense.
[06:18:10] <jzaefferer> still better then sending the PR and getting shot down, isn't it? ;)
[06:19:00] <theBrettman> I'll have to study up on popup later. looks like that's going to replace a lot of code in ui?
