[01:35:17] <jzaefferer> hartfordcyclist, we're likely gonna change and break stuff, so you'd have to be okay with migrating code here and there. On the other hand, as an early adopter you can provide us with feedback and shape things to come, so for stuff where you think they should change, its much easier to do that now.
[03:22:24] <g0> hello. Is the server side code of ThemeRoller open source?
[04:41:38] <rworth> g0: not the current version, but the next version that's currently in development will be. Get with danheberden if you're interested in helping out
[04:42:28] <g0> rworth: Sure! Thanks

[08:33:13] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: Sweet
[08:42:16] <kborchers> jzaefferer: could you take a look at this when you have a minute and let me know what you think? https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/blob/menu_inputs/tests/visual/menu/inputmenu.html

[09:19:16] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Implement editing events in grid demo. - Jörn Zaefferer
[09:23:33] <jzaefferer> kborchers, checking now
[09:23:43] <kborchers> cool, thanks
[09:30:07] <jzaefferer> kborchers, looks and works pretty good, tested in Chrome and IE6. Only issue I spotted (in both) is the Group Label
[09:30:19] <jzaefferer> it has the ui-menu-item class, so can be selected etc.
[09:30:51] <jzaefferer> it shouldn't be selectable (mouse click) and should be skipped when doing arrow navigation
[09:31:36] <kborchers> right, ok i will fix that. any other issues or functionality you would expect to see?
[09:31:44] <jzaefferer> you should merge upstream - I recently added disabled item styles: .ui-menu li.ui-state-disabled {}
[09:31:59] <kborchers> oh, good to know. will do
[09:32:06] <jzaefferer> well, checkbox and radio buttons can usually be activated with space key
[09:32:12] <jzaefferer> that doesn't work
[09:32:25] <jzaefferer> would make sense to add
[09:32:31] <kborchers> definitely
[09:33:32] <jzaefferer> what's that about: "TODO: Radio icons are reversed so update once fixed"?
[09:34:11] <jzaefferer> also, did you took a look at the formcontrols branch?
[09:34:36] <kborchers> ui-icon-radio-on and -off are backwards. rworth said he noticed that a while back as well and asked that I drop in a todo so we remember to switch them once that is fixed, whenever that may be
[09:34:42] <jzaefferer> dunno if we could use those in the menu
[09:34:56] <jzaefferer> okay, do you know if there's a ticket?
[09:35:10] <kborchers> no but i can look and file if not
[09:35:21] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:36:55] <kborchers> i did look at formcontrols. not sure how i would incorporate those or what they would add functionaly. what were your thoughts?
[09:37:26] <jzaefferer> dunno, haven't looked at the code for a long time, if ever
[09:37:42] <jzaefferer> but they also render custom buttons..
[09:39:40] <kborchers> i'll look through it some more and see if there is anything that might be useful here
[09:39:49] <kborchers> thanks for the input
[09:42:53] <jzaefferer> goodie
[09:43:01] <jzaefferer> looking already pretty good, looking forward to further updates
[09:43:48] <jzaefferer> ah, and formcontrols are on the roadmap for Grid Stage 3, so even if the code is out of date or whatever, we need to update that pretty soon anyway
[09:44:24] <kborchers> ok, cool
[13:07:59] <adoven_> hey guys

[13:22:53] <gnarf> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3952#comment:12 - jzaefferer ?
[13:35:49] <adoven_> hmm: http://jsfiddle.net/THJRP/
[13:36:34] <adoven_> is that how bounceslide is supposed to work?
[13:45:30] <ryanneufeld> adoven_:  looks fine
[13:57:17] <gnarf> adoven_: were you looking at that ticket or something different?
[14:00:14] <adoven_> well
[14:00:24] <adoven_> i've been looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/287
[14:00:52] <adoven_> so i was going to implement just using the last animation in the animation queue instead of going through all of them
[14:01:57] <adoven_> now i'm running into an issue where bounceslide isn't working correctly with kborcher's changes
[14:03:51] <gnarf> random idea i don't have time to test
[14:03:51] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/273
[14:04:06] <gnarf> out of curiosity do the "inconsistencies" go away if we include a reset css?
[14:08:20] <gnarf> nope
[14:26:19] <jzaefferer> gnarf, dude, 23 months ago! I don't even remember what I did yesterday!
[14:28:59] <gnarf> jzaefferer: ;)
[14:29:20] <gnarf> jzaefferer: then i guess "needs info"
[14:48:43] <jzaefferer> if it works fine, close it - as long as we get emails about comments, we can reopen
[14:48:56] <jzaefferer> though I actually got rid of the emails, dunno if you get any?
[14:49:03] <jzaefferer> but both Richard and Scott do...
[14:50:48] <gnarf> the effects category emails me
[14:50:57] <gnarf> categories
[15:45:37] <jzaefferer> okay
[15:45:45] <jzaefferer> ping Richard or Scott if you want more :-)
