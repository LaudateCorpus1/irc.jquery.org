[05:02:02] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, gd morning
[05:02:36] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, for the issues we talked about, we're all done. I'm working on reviewing the bug list on trac
[05:03:18] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I also need to snif test it to check it everything is alright. Our current unit tests are all passing
[05:04:46] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, have you worked on fixing this? (that one I did not go thru yet) https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/build-themes/build/tasks/build.js
[05:05:20] <rxaviers> generate theme, yes as far as I saw, right?
[06:07:44] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, we have a question from thezoggy "also, any future plans to use LESS / SASS ?" https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/16
[06:20:17] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] rxaviers pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/WzKjdw
[06:20:17] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Show checked dependents only on dialog message - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[06:33:31] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, a couple of bugs in the trac list are related to ie6. Any idea how I can test it? I have a mac book box with dual boot (linux and mac).
[06:33:58] <rxaviers> any hints?
[06:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ok, I'm just going to drop both from the changelog then.
[06:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yes, I'll get node-logger published today.
[06:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'll get you a BrowserStack account.
[06:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Invite sent. If you use that to register, you'll have unlimted usage.
[06:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yes, we're very close to releasing.
[06:46:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: fyi, plan to test ie6 tonight then we should be all good in terms of demos and visual tests … testing all of that via browserstack takes for ever and is kind of hard since the visual feedback is a little choppy
[06:47:13] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, cool thks
[06:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Should be fine, we're really just looking for broken stuff at this point since you know it's working everywhere else.
[06:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I need a name for the logger
[06:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> logger and simple-logger are both taken :-P
[06:49:44] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, wow this is so cool
[06:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yeah, BrowserStack is pretty awesome.
[06:50:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually giving a presentation on it tomorrow.
[06:50:34] <rxaviers> :)
[06:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: isn't /themes/base/**/* the same as /themes/base/** ?
[06:59:44] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer gnarf rxaviers: https://npmjs.org/package/simple-log
[06:59:54] <scott_gonzalez> Let's update all of the repos now :-P
[07:00:05] <rxaviers> :)
[07:08:57] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] rxaviers pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/GOXIdQ
[07:08:57] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Update logger to its published name "simple-log" - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[07:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Did you test the change to simple-log?
[07:15:02] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like you forgot to update the require() calls.
[07:16:01] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, isnt it still require( "logger" )?
[07:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> No, because the name is now simple-log.
[07:16:41] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, oh oh, I looked the README here: https://npmjs.org/package/simple-log
[07:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> crap
[07:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'll fix the readme and release 1.0.1.
[07:17:21] <scott_gonzalez> You can keep using 1.0.0 if you want though, there won't be any actual code changes.
[07:17:46] <rxaviers> weird that my sniff test running the server worked
[07:17:55] <rxaviers> mm perhaps in my node_modules I have both let me check
[07:18:05] <rxaviers> ah
[07:18:07] <rxaviers> ok will fixed
[07:18:10] <rxaviers> fix it
[07:18:13] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, thanks
[07:20:23] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...looks like the npm site is caching the old version for a while.
[07:20:32] <scott_gonzalez> 1.0.1 is published with an updated readme.
[07:28:14] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] rxaviers pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Jr8S9g
[07:28:14] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Fix simple-log require calls - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[07:36:01] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: cheerio doesn't seem to be working for me.
[07:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> I can't figure out why this isn't working.
[07:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> $.html() shows me the full source.
[07:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> If I copy the output from $.html() put it into a file, then read that in to cheerio.load() it works fine.
[10:13:25] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: weird
[10:15:32] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the theme build task is done and merged
[10:16:20] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I don't care abot sass/less, but we could discuss that later when planning the next version, after 1.9
[10:21:02] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can you push to a branch?
[10:23:39] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez created cheerio (+1 new commit): http://git.io/t4FGXA
[10:23:39] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/cheerio] Use cheerio instead of jsdom. - Scott González
[10:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/compare/cheerio
[10:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> Notice that I have to call $.root() to get it to work.
[10:24:19] <jzaefferer> looks likedownload builder isn't running anymore, syslog isn't conclusive as to why :/
[10:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> Also, when I set the text for the <code> element, it ends up being a single line in the syntax highlighting.
[10:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Did you npm install?
[10:25:20] <jzaefferer> looks like that still fails on node-syslog@1.1.16
[10:25:37] <scott_gonzalez> That would mean you're not logged in as jqdeploy.
[10:25:46] <jzaefferer> just looking at syslog
[10:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> Oh
[10:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:26:04] <jzaefferer> download-ui.sh failed to install node-syslog
[10:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> So syslog logged that syslog didn't install? :-P
[10:26:18] <jzaefferer> yep
[10:31:01] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I fixed the permissions on the server.
[10:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> node-syslog is now installed.
[10:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Not sure what caused the permissions to be messed up, but the download.jqueryui.com was mostly owned by root.
[10:34:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: so anything that puppet touches should be owned by jqdeploy?
[10:35:15] <jzaefferer> if that's the case, I can take the blame for setting up the thing badly in the first place, though I'd still blame gnarf for not fixing that ;)
[10:35:55] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez gnarf: how do we trigger puppet to restart the download service?
[10:36:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, everything is owned by jqdeploy who does not have a lot of perms.
[10:36:10] <jzaefferer> catalog run seems to happen every once in a while, but I'd like to test something now...
[10:36:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: not sure
[10:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> I think there's something like `puppet test` but I don't remember the actual command.
[10:39:29] <jzaefferer> `puppet help` is very confusing
[10:46:59] <jzaefferer> googling for "puppet manual catalog run" is just giving me at least two year old articles. One references "puppetd", which doesn't exist on this system
[10:47:09] <jzaefferer> I really need a puppet crashcourse from gnarf
[10:48:38] <jzaefferer> wow, clicking the "Toggle All" checkbox pops up 8 dialogs
[10:49:01] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: can we not show any confirm dialogs when the user clicks that top-level Toggle All checkbox?
[10:49:32] <jzaefferer> or just in general for the toggle checkboxes? or merge them into one? so that its always just one dialog
[10:52:19] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: also https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/5#issuecomment-8827825
[10:53:30] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez gnarf: downloader is running again, but, from syslog: https://gist.github.com/576bc0d513caa312b287
[10:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:54:30] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the question marks next to the Advanced Theme Settings inputs are broken
[10:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, lunch is over and now the wifi is going to suck again.
[11:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Demos now use the CDN.
[11:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably add an easy way to copy the code.
[11:14:41] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/bQoOUw
[11:14:41] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Use jQuery CDN instead of local copies of jQuery and jQuery UI for demos. Fixes #5. - Scott González

[11:18:11] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Updated comments to match new behavior of using CDN. - Scott González
[11:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Any update on subdirectory sites?
[11:28:32] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, will answer in a sec
[11:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ThemeSwitcher is going to break.
[11:50:37] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, it's quicker to make "Toggle All" simply skip dialog. Although, merging the dependencies could be more useful to the user. Want me to implement the 2nd option?
[11:51:29] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, will fix the other two issues
[12:35:55] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] rxaviers pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/pp3Sgw
[12:35:55] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Replace variable name s/field/component - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[12:35:56] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Fix Builder for no components and add "select no components" unit test - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[13:31:42] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/nTCN3Q
[13:31:42] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] First pass at 1.9.0 changelog. - Scott González
[13:40:42] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: regarding ThemeSwitcher - is that something we're okay with, or something we need to fix now? rxaviers - depending on the outcome, can you look into that (the fixing)?
[13:41:18] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, is ThemeSwitcher the bookmarklet? What's it?
[13:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> At a minimum it needs a redirect to keep existing pages working.
[13:41:53] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/ThemeSwitcher
[13:42:24] <rxaviers> ok, just let me know and surely I can look into that
[13:42:26] <jzaefferer> we actually broke it already, when we prevented hotlinking resources - it now only works on our own sites anyway
[13:42:36] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[13:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> In that case, let's not do anything for it yet.
[13:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather rewrite it and build it cleanly when we have time.
[14:05:37] <scott_gonzalez> hooray for net splits
[14:27:14] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, changelog looks nice
[14:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[14:27:54] <_zoggy_> dunno how ocd you wanna do.. but the Removed / Fixed / Added / Deprecated are in different order.. dunno if you were trying to make them consistent in each section
[14:28:12] <_zoggy_> personally i'd like to see what was removed up top.. know if something is going to break
[14:28:49] <scott_gonzalez> They're all in the same order.
[14:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's removed, deprecated, added, fixed.
[14:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: If you're concerned with what's going to break, you should be reading the upgrade guide.
[14:29:59] <_zoggy_> of course
[14:30:27] <_zoggy_> but im just saying if i was glancing at the changelog to take a peak, seeing what i can gleam easily
[14:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> That would make it really hard for people to find info by plugin though.
[14:32:32] <_zoggy_> so like progressbar / slider
[14:32:43] <_zoggy_> is there anything to note ? or they just placeholders?
[14:33:17] <scott_gonzalez> Those headers will go away when the changelog is finalized.
[14:33:18] <_zoggy_> aka, be better to remove the header or add a note that says 'no changes found' or something. to aleviate ambiguitiy
[14:33:22] <_zoggy_> ok
[14:34:17] <scott_gonzalez> The changelog starts with just an empty outline: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/release/changelog-shell
[14:34:30] <_zoggy_> yeah i figure
[14:34:40] <_zoggy_> but i didnt know if you were still working and just havent gotten to that section
[14:34:49] <_zoggy_> or if there really was nothing to put under them
[14:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> There's nothing to put there.
[15:04:05] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, guys, just double checking. Is ThemeSwitcher something we want fixed now, or we're skipping it for now?
[15:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> skipping
[15:07:04] <rxaviers> thanks
