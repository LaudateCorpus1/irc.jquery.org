[02:45:54] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI Mask build #12: STILL FAILING in 10 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20Mask/12/
[02:45:54] <jq-jenkins> * jay: Datepicker: Fix `this` reference in _hideDatepicker(). Fixed #7722 - Datepicker: Does not properly clear current instance when hidden.
[02:45:55] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Widget tests: Fixed _super() call in redefine test.
[02:45:55] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Widget: Don't use $.event.props when creating events.
[02:45:56] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Widget: Simplify data normalization in _trigger().
[02:45:56] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Droppable: Make sure._drop is called for all relevant droppables. Fixes #6009 - Upper droppable should receive draggable. Fixes #6085 - Parent droppable takes precedence over dynamically created child droppable.
[02:45:57] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Selectable: Explicitly check event.ctrlKey now that jQuery differentiates between meta and ctrl. Fixes #7858 - ctrl-click to select multiple elements not working.
[02:45:57] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Upgrade jQuery to 1.7.1.
[02:45:58] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Autocomplete: Making sure we do not show search menu after a blur. Fixed #7423 - Tab out of autocomplete with remote source can leave menu showing.
[02:45:58] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Autocomplete: Removed commented out test.
[02:45:59] <jq-jenkins> * kris.borchers: Menu: Move mousedown handler into _bind and fix focusing of the Menu after click. Fixes focus issues with Selectmenu and Autocomplete.
[02:45:59] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Upgrade jQuery to 1.7.1.
[05:18:34] <jzaefferer> been thinking some more about jQuery UI and templates. Currently it seems like jQuery UI really doesn't need a template engine. If anything, it needs a simple string interpolation helper, that's not more then 6 lines of code if you want to support curriying; template engines are great for application development, and we want to push that as well, but that doesn't mean jQuery UI has to depend on it

[09:09:15] <gnarf> happy Thanksgiving kborchers :)
