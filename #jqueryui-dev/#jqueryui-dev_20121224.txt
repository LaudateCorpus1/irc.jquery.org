[08:45:56] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: you're a machine
[08:46:20] <scott_gonzalez> MUST UPDATE ALL THE SITES!!!!!1111
[08:47:05] <ryanneufeld> the new sites are sessy thogh
[08:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'll be nice when we can launch with new-css.
[08:48:28] <ryanneufeld> I've been using the stage. sites for looking up docs myself
[08:52:37] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, we need to deploy api.jquery.com.
[08:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Let me know when you're around :-)
[08:53:03] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, ryanneufeld: You can probably answer this question...
[08:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> Is the production server setup to handle api.jquery.com deployments?
[08:53:37] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I'm not sure what is required to handle deployments
[08:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously DNS hasn't been switched yet, but do you know if the script is running?
[08:53:44] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:54:03] <ryanneufeld> if you know what the script is, I can check for it
[08:54:08] <scott_gonzalez> The GitHub web hook is already setup.
[08:54:27] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see if I can figure that out from the email notifications.
[08:56:01] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure, the script would be named jquery.com.sh.
[08:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> I think it'd be on jq02.jquery.com
[08:57:04] <ryanneufeld> http://cl.ly/image/1g1y191A2L2A
[08:57:59] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let me try tagging and then updating my hosts file to point at the server and see if that's working.
[08:58:03] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: looks like there is a depoly rule setup
[08:58:17] <ryanneufeld> you can do a git commit --allow-empty
[08:58:20] <scott_gonzalez> Is the web server 01?
[08:58:25] <ryanneufeld> if you don't want any code changes
[08:58:34] <ryanneufeld> i'm sorry 01?
[08:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> jq01
[08:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I can just ping jqueryui.com and get the IP.
[08:58:59] <ryanneufeld> jq01 is a wordpress machine
[08:59:06] <ryanneufeld> jq02 is the builder
[08:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that's what I thought.
[08:59:23] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/DNS-AXFR
[08:59:35] <ryanneufeld> every IP/hostname
[09:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ping
[09:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Do you know what the DNS TTL is set to for jquery.com?
[09:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> err... api.jquery.com
[09:04:42] <ryanneufeld> looks like about 600 seconds left
[09:04:54] <ryanneufeld> dig api.jquery.com will tell you what the remainder is
[09:06:00] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: default ttl is one hour
[09:06:12] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so propagation should be pretty quick once we switch over.
[09:06:18] <ryanneufeld> indeed
[09:06:25] <ryanneufeld> is that the plan though?
[09:06:34] <ryanneufeld> just switch servers?
[09:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> d'oh
[09:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> The auto-deploy script failed.
[09:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> I bet it's pointing at the WordPress server via name and not IP.
[09:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> So it's trying to deploy to the existing site.
[09:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...if I change this to IP, it probably won't work either.
[09:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> WordPress won't know which site to update.
[09:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> Can I update the hosts file on jq02 temporarily?
[09:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> to point api.jquery.com at jq01
[09:09:08] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure what the ramifications of that will be
[09:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll just leave it and wait till gnarf is around.
[09:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> I've got another idea.
[09:10:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to deploy from my machine.
[09:10:11] <ryanneufeld> There you go
[09:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> yay, deploying...

[09:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> Is the Google Group still the best way to send a message to the infra team?
[09:12:17] <ryanneufeld> I would assume so
[09:12:31] <ryanneufeld> since everyone seems very AFK lately
[09:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> email sent
[09:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> server is updated :-)
[09:27:08] <ryanneufeld> nice
[09:28:42] <ryanneufeld> wait, so what was updated?
[09:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> I deployed to the new server, so if you point your DNS to the new server, api.jquery.com has the new site.
[09:55:44] <ryanneufeld> oic
[09:56:21] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I dont think I'm on the infra group
[10:03:13] <ryanneufeld> can you add me?
[10:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[10:05:37] <scott_gonzalez> I take that back. I can't.
[10:05:43] <ryanneufeld> LIAR
[10:05:46] <ryanneufeld> okay
[10:05:51] <ryanneufeld> well, it's not a big deal
[10:06:24] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden RWhitbeck rworth kswedberg can
[10:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, even gnarf isn't an owner on the list :-/
[10:06:56] <ryanneufeld> wow
[10:06:59] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps infrastructure@jquery.com would've been better?
[10:07:07] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I'm on that one
[10:07:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so that's probably the active one then.
[10:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just resend.
[10:07:24] <RWhitbeck> I'm around
[10:07:29] <RWhitbeck> what do you need?
[10:07:39] <ryanneufeld> crack
[10:07:43] <ryanneufeld> I need some crack
[10:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> Can you add ryanneufeld to the jquery-infrastructure Google Group?
[10:07:56] <RWhitbeck> I know a guy ;-)
[10:07:57] <ryanneufeld> where crack, is me being added to that list :)
[10:08:19] <RWhitbeck> ryan can you PM your desired email address to be added?
[10:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like that may actually be inactive, but until we can confirm it'd be good to have him on the list :-)
[10:16:59] <RWhitbeck> he's been invited‚Ä¶I made gnarf a manager ‚Ä¶ I can't figure out how to make him an owner though. 
[10:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, that should be good enough.
