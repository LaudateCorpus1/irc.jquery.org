[02:33:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We should consider deprecating $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition and defaultPageTransition ...
[02:33:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's getting kinda weird now that we're deprecating the dialog widget.
[02:34:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We should do things the same way as the popup widget. It has a transition option that can be overridden on the link.
[02:40:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree this should be an option in the page widget
[02:42:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then you can still configure the default

[05:01:51] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_ uGoMobi
[05:02:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:03:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: how are things going with api
[05:03:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Haven't really looked at it since ...
[05:03:31] <_|Nix|_> Unfortunately ...
[05:03:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok
[05:04:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm looking over demos/pages-dialog/index.php and I'm noticing that this whole page/dialog thing has gotten really confusing since we've deprecated the dialog widget.
[05:04:32] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:04:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Don't get me wrong - the deprecated method works, and the new method works, so we're fine in that regard.
[05:05:05] <arschmitz> just gotta make clear pages styled as dialogs are not dialogs
[05:05:11] <arschmitz> they are pages
[05:05:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The only thing is that we're no longer making use of is defaultDialogTransition.
[05:05:53] <arschmitz> we are if its a dialog arnt we?
[05:06:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we should modify the pagecontainer to apply the defaultDialogTransition if $.data( page[ 0 ], "mobile-page" ).options.dialog === true )
[05:06:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if its an actual dialog defaultdialogtranstion works right?
[05:06:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not if you don't have data-rel="dialog" on your link ...
[05:07:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its always been that way
[05:07:16] <arschmitz> other wise we have no idea its a dialog 
[05:07:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, yes we do - data-role="dialog" on the target or data-role="page" and data-dialog="true"
[05:07:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and data-role="dialog" is now deprecated.
[05:08:45] <arschmitz> i dont think we should respect it for data-dialog=true
[05:09:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think the bottom line is that we should deprecate both defaultDialogTransition and defaultPageTransition, and we should have an API for page which retrieves the name of the transition that should be used.
[05:09:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, page.page( "transition" )
[05:09:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why wouldnt you just set it on the link?
[05:09:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then, the page widget can decide on the transition based on whether or not it's a dialog.
[05:10:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, of course! You can set it on the link, but the default should be retrieved from the page.
[05:10:02] <arschmitz> transition logic should not be part of page
[05:10:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Popup works that way too.
[05:10:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You can set data-transition on both the popup and the link.
[05:10:39] <arschmitz> any transition related logic should be part of the pagecontainer which performs the transitions
[05:11:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, one might argue that page now has an open/close function, so the transition should be there - just like with popup.
[05:11:43] <arschmitz> how does page have open close function?
[05:11:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm not talking about transition related logic, but regarding configuration information - as to which transition to apply.
[05:12:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Via the page.dialog plugin.
[05:12:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If that plugin is loaded, /all/ pages have that function, whether they're dialogs or not.
[05:12:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Now, I know that that's not the intention, but you can't apply an extension to some elements and not to others :/
[05:13:06] <arschmitz> well maybe we need to rethink the extension then
[05:13:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So that also adds to the confusion.
[05:13:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking $.widget( "mobile.dialog", $.mobile.page, { ... } );
[05:13:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and you CAN do that by making those return if not data-dialog=true
[05:14:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz:  ... and we keep data-role="dialog" for autoinit.
[05:14:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure i agree
[05:15:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: infact im not sure why i have the close method at all
[05:15:37] <arschmitz> the the close button should just be a back button
[05:16:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's a good point. After all, you can just as easily $( ":mobile-pagecontainer" ).pagecontainer( "back" );
[05:16:11] <arschmitz> and then it removes all that logic which basicly duplicates the back function in pagecontianer
[05:16:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not even
[05:16:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[05:16:27] <arschmitz> just make the button data-rel back
[05:16:42] <arschmitz> then you dont even need the click handler
[05:16:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, yeah. Now you can even do just that, because we now have a proper implementation of "back".
[05:17:03] <arschmitz> yup
[05:17:21] <arschmitz> i think ill make that change
[05:17:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Unfortunately, we've already published the close() method, so we'll need to deprecate that.
[05:17:49] <arschmitz> where?
[05:17:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the dialog, haven't we?
[05:18:07] <arschmitz> this is not a dialog
[05:18:18] <arschmitz> its a page styled as a dialog
[05:18:27] <arschmitz> there has never been a published api for that
[05:18:30] <arschmitz> its new
[05:18:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait. Good point. Yes!
[05:18:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[05:19:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... rip that sucker right outta there ...
[05:20:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do you want an issue for that change?
[05:21:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Please also remove "role": "button" from the code that adds the back button, because we've agreed that links should not have the button role, else we need to implement press-space-to-click.
[05:23:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, I still think we should get rid of $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition and $.mobile.defaultPageTransition.
[05:23:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah open an issue better for changelog
[05:23:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[05:23:55] <arschmitz> and yes i was actually the one that said we needed to remove role button
[05:24:05] <arschmitz> i just passed it on to uGoMobi 
[05:24:10] <arschmitz> last week
[05:24:44] <arschmitz> i realized it when working on new button widget with scott
[05:25:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We should do it like this: transition: function() { return this.options.transition ? this.options.transition : this.options.dialog ? $.mobile.page.defaults.transition.dialog : $.mobile.page.defaults.transition.page; }
[05:26:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: And the page container does transition = $.mobile.getAttribute( link, "transition" ) || page.page( "transition" );
[05:30:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not sure whether, assuming we do this at all, we should do this for 1.4.0 and remove $.mobile.default*Transition in 1.5.0, or whether we should wait another version.
[05:36:01] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #6609: widgets/page.dialog: Remove function close() and modify "Back" button to have data-rel="back"  02http://git.io/dNKrlA
[05:37:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The dialog widget implementation had code in place for preventing someone from clicking "Close" multiple times. You didn't bring that over into the dialog extenstion. Is that accidental, or did you intentionally leave it out?
[05:38:15] <arschmitz> intentional 
[05:38:25] <arschmitz> because it should just be a back button
[05:38:36] <arschmitz> its not history free anymore
[05:39:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, and I guess back buttons (and any other buttons) everywhere are prone to being clicked on more than once. I don't even know why I put that code into place.
[05:40:04] <arschmitz> before it would be bad
[05:40:19] <arschmitz> because you would go back twice but squash the history for both
[05:40:35] <arschmitz> so it would get all messed up
[05:40:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so it made sense before but not anymore
[05:41:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. In that case, I'll remove _isCloseable: false from the $.extend inside page.dialog.
[05:41:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or, I guess I'll add that to the issue above, since you're gonna be working in that area anyway. Cool?
[05:41:27] <arschmitz> when did that get added?
[05:41:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's just declared in $.extend, but never used.
[05:41:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Checking now ...
[05:42:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When you added page.dialog (173a1012)
[05:42:46] <arschmitz> ohh yeah i see it now
[05:42:51] <arschmitz> that was a mistake 
[05:43:03] <arschmitz> i should not have added that in the firstplace
[05:43:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Don't worry about it - it's not like it's been causing anything ...
[05:43:37] <arschmitz> yeah just unneeded
[05:44:11] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, great! thanks :-)
[05:44:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i need to run something over to the babysitters i forgot this morning ill fix this issue when i get back

[09:25:14] <agcolom> and I have a JQM bug in my code ;-)
[09:25:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: pfff I can imagine
[09:25:33] <agcolom> but that's just because my code is horrible!
[09:25:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ah what? a JQM bug? what's that?
[09:25:43] <uGoMobi> ah ok :)
[09:26:06] <uGoMobi> we don't have bugs, only room for improvement ;-)
[09:26:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how was the a11y summit? useful?
[09:26:31] <agcolom> you know, the kind of code where you get something small and then you add to it and then you add more.... and after a while you think... is it time to rewrite everything ;-)
[09:26:36] <arschmitz> yeah it was good
[09:26:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: oh yeah, I totally know what you mean :)
[09:26:54] <agcolom> I heard there was a good one on JQM

[09:28:54] <arschmitz> yup i have that fix pretty much ready to go i had wanted to check with you first to make sure eveything was good on your end since it had been a few days

[09:30:20] <agcolom> cannot call methods prior to initialization
[09:30:40] <arschmitz> agcolom that means checkboxradio has not been called on the element your trying to call the method on
[09:30:41] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you have a JS Bin or something to look at?
[09:31:09] <agcolom> I can upload it and give you a link?

[09:56:20] <agcolom> it was autoupdating!

[09:58:10] <agcolom> arschmitz: is yours still auto-updating?

[09:59:04] <agcolom> strange...

[12:33:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[12:36:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: So, what do you think about deprecating $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition and defaultPageTransition and giving page a getTransition() method which will tell pagecontainer what transition to use when going from page to page if no transition is specified on the link?
[12:37:51] <_|Nix|_> Oh, and also giving page a transition option.
[12:38:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sounds good to me but this is something for 1.5
[12:38:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Roger that. I can make an issue with the proposal.
[12:39:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks
[12:39:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can milestone it 1.5-2.0

[13:01:28] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #6613: Deprecate $.mobile.defaultPageTransition and $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition  02http://git.io/Z-lVvQ
[13:07:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For 1.4.0, we could still deprecate $.mobile.defaultPageTransition and $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition and move them to $.mobile.page.defaults.transition.{page,dialog}
[13:08:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That way we'd get a head start on things for 1.5.0.
[13:08:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can't deprecate anymore now we are on beta
[13:08:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK. NM.
[13:08:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 1.5.0 it is.
[13:08:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yup
[13:11:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: One thing we're missing in 1.4.0 is that if you use neither data-rel="dialog" on the link nor data-role="dialog" on the page, then you don't get the pop transition.
[13:11:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... that goes with the approach whereby dialogs are no longer special, and they're just normal pages, but it goes against what we've had so far, which is that dialogs get pop by default, and not fade.
[13:13:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you need to remember these are simply pages styled as dialogs Styled they get no other specialness other then style if they want it to pop they should set the transition to pop
[13:14:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but so far they didn't need to do that explicitly. I'm trying to decide whether this is an API break or not.
[13:14:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there is no so far this is new
[13:15:10] <arschmitz> this is not a replacement for dialog
[13:15:19] <arschmitz> it is just a new option / extensuon for page
[13:15:29] <arschmitz> so you can break an api the didnt previously exist
[13:15:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, but there is a way to regain this automagic assignment of the pop transition, but that way has come too late for 1.4.0.
[13:15:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but there should not be automatic asignment 
[13:16:21] <arschmitz> because its a page not a dialog

[13:16:40] <arschmitz> there are no more dialogs
[13:16:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[13:17:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I pushed the new navmenu contents ^^^
[13:17:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: awesome thanks
[13:17:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. So we have implicitly deprecated $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition ...
[13:18:09] <arschmitz> yes because if there are no dialogs they cant have a default transition
[13:18:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's right. This is actually good.
[13:19:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, authoring a dialog is not going to be as easy as data-dialog="true".
[13:19:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because devs will have to take care to make sure that every link that opens the dialog has transition pop.
[13:19:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So we're removing some convenience there ... not saying that's a bad thing.
[13:19:54] <arschmitz> if they want it to have pop yes
[13:20:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well we are removing a widget and everything that goes with it
[13:20:53] <arschmitz> there is a similar new option on page but its just that a similar option not a replacement
[13:25:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : how about two options in page widget: transition and dialogTransition?
[13:26:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well dialog could add an option
[13:26:15] <arschmitz> but you would not want to make page itself have it
[13:26:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the other option is to do this in getCreateOptions
[13:26:41] <arschmitz> and if the page is styled as a dialog set its transition to pop
[13:27:13] <uGoMobi> and what if you want another transition for the dialog?
[13:27:26] <arschmitz> actually if we wanted to support this you would add the option within the extension
[13:27:43] <uGoMobi> yes, you're right
[13:27:51] <arschmitz> and in get greateoptions you would set transition to dialog transtion if it is a dialog
[13:30:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can make this change if you want or we can leave as a new option for 1.5?
[13:32:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think it can wait
[13:33:09] <arschmitz> sounds good
[13:33:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you can set the transition on the page that is styled as dialog
[13:33:31] <uGoMobi> so it's not that you can't set it at all
[13:34:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: are you around?
[13:35:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right its just that pages styled as dialogs do not get pop transition by default
[13:36:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i actually think we should wait on this forsure
[13:36:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, so that's an improvement we can make in 1.5 when the dialog widget doesn't exist anymore
[13:36:28] <arschmitz> because im actually very unsure trnasition should even be set on page
[13:36:33] <arschmitz> because page does not use it
[13:36:43] <arschmitz> pageContainer does
[13:37:03] <arschmitz> it does not really make sense to have it as an option in the page widget
[13:37:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: then we can also think about how we deprecate $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition
[13:37:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well that is already implictly deprecated
[13:37:49] <arschmitz> because it is only used by dialog widget
[13:37:54] <arschmitz> and that is deprecated
[13:38:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah true
[13:38:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but maybe it's not so clear to users
[13:38:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah but that just means we should mark it as such in api before final
[13:38:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so maybe we can do something similar as we did with the loader widget
[13:38:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: still use it during one version
[13:38:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but here keeping it does nothing
[13:39:04] <arschmitz> because dialog is gone
[13:39:10] <arschmitz> setting it wont do anything
[13:39:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, in this case we could just add it to the key changes and API docs
[13:39:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its really just a docs issue
[13:39:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right exactly
[13:40:14] <arschmitz> we just need to make sure we have it marked and announced as deprecated
[13:40:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but I can imagine people expect to get a new way of configuring the default transition for a dialog (read: page styled as dialog)
[13:40:57] <uGoMobi> and we don't have that yet
[13:41:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes they may expect it
[13:41:26] <arschmitz> but we have not promised to deliver it
[13:41:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the extension is style only 
[13:44:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: does $.mobile.defaultPageTransition still work?
[13:44:34] <arschmitz> on dialogs
[13:44:50] <arschmitz> but not on pages styled as dialogs because they are pafe
[13:44:54] <arschmitz> pages
[13:45:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, I meant for pages
[13:45:24] <uGoMobi> styled as page or dialog
[13:45:54] <arschmitz> oh sorry read wrong
[13:46:05] <arschmitz> defaultpagetransition works yes
[13:46:22] <arschmitz> and it works regardless of page style
[13:46:30] <uGoMobi> ok

[14:27:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So what is the final word? Are we going to have any logic that automagically gives dialog-styled pages a different transition from regular pages?
[14:27:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I ask because I'm wondering whether we can close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6613
[14:27:53] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6613 by gabrielschulhof (1h 26m ago): Deprecate $.mobile.defaultPageTransition and $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition
[14:29:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Since arschmitz mentioned that pages should have no transition information at all, I figured that the way to reduce that is to have defaults stored on $.mobile.page.defaults.transition.page and $.mobile.page.defaults.transition.dialog, and pagecontainer can check whether toPage.page( "option", "dialog" ) is true in order to decide which transition to use.
[14:29:46] <_|Nix|_> That way, we don't need any new options on page.
[14:30:45] <_|Nix|_> In fact, we can already do that now, probably, and re-introduce the two different transitions that people are used to.

[14:36:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, it may be better to truly get rid of any and all special handling for dialogs, and get people to specify explicitly if/when they want something to look/feel like a dialog.
[14:37:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... including the transition.
[14:37:22] <_|Nix|_> It would certainly simplify things.

[15:31:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because i would like to lookinto the navigation api and transitions place in that hopefully for 1.5 i would make an issue for this and tag it navigation or pageContainer
[15:31:21] <arschmitz> and then this can be considdered when that is looked into
[15:31:38] <arschmitz> as part of the greater navigation api refactor.
[18:35:52] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Most of datetime format has been implemented. Week of Year and its flavors took some time to implement aff. Now, Im summing up some questions to send to the CLDR group about some other fields, and I will get my hands on the timezone fields
[18:35:59] <rxaviers> (just fyi)
[18:36:47] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, fya please, if you have some time, I need you to review why QUnit isnt working via grunt. I have ported tests back to it. It's working via browser. Perhaps, something stupid Im doing. :P
[18:41:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Iv been looking at branch demos-nav and i have a bunch of questions before i make any changes. Ill catch up with you about it in the morning if your around

[23:45:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : I think for 1.4 we should only add a comment in the code and a note in the key changes that $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition only works with the dialog widget, which means it has been deprecated as well. If you use pages styled as dialog and want to use a different transition for them (like "pop") you currently have to set it for every
[23:45:57] <uGoMobi> instance.
[23:47:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure np, let me know when you are around and we can look at demos-nav
