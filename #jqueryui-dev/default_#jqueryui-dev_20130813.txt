[01:44:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: morning
[01:44:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! In IE8 you can't set new text on a style node :(
[01:44:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, in my popup arrow size demo, I can't do a live preview of the new popup arrow size.
[01:45:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have $( "#arrowStyle" ).text( css ); and that causes some error in IE8 :(
[01:45:31] <_|Nix|_> Where <style id="arrowStyle"></style>
[01:45:54] <_|Nix|_> This really sucks :(
[01:46:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm
[01:46:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but do devs use IE8?
[01:46:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess I can try to remove the tag and inject a new one.
[01:47:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: SO has a slow solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6631871/modifying-the-innerhtml-of-a-style-element-in-ie8
[01:49:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I wouldn't worry to much about it. Just add small note that the demo doesn't work on IE8
[01:49:45] <Kol> hi i want jquery ui just so i can use the datepicker, what're the miniimum of files i need to include in my project for that to work? (i'm kinda overwhelmed by the amount of stuff in the file i downloaded)
[01:49:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nah ... I got it to work with that workaround.
[01:49:56] <_|Nix|_> Kol: Use the download builder.
[01:50:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ouch! The transform is all wrong ...
[01:50:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: OK, nice if you can fix it of course
[01:50:31] <uGoMobi> :(
[01:50:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IE8 is a disaster.
[01:50:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wish the W3C had police powers.
[01:51:02] <uGoMobi> oh really? ;)
[01:51:11] <uGoMobi> lol
[02:00:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yaaay! I figured out the weird margin settings that are necessary for the rotation to work correctly in IE8!
[02:01:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It seems you have to set margin-left: -sizeOfArrow / 3.5px; margin-top: -sizeOfArrow / 3.5px; for the rotation to be correctly centred.
[02:01:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: awesome! 
[02:01:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The factor is probably more like 3.73nnnnn :/
[02:01:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: CSS is easy :)
[02:01:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But 3.5 works up to an arrow size of 90px.

[05:20:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh that's awesome
[05:21:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I noticed a problem with popup / custom select theme classes
[05:21:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/selects/custom-selects.php
[05:21:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's a little more CSS, because left/top/right/bottom can no longer be treated equally.
[05:21:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's the problem?
[05:22:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you open the first select on that page
[05:22:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[05:22:50] <uGoMobi> you will see that popup screen gets class ui-overlay-inherit and popup container a class null
[05:23:19] <uGoMobi> ui-overlay-inherit doesn't cause issues, but we don't use it
[05:23:39] <uGoMobi> I think this happens when no overlay theme is set for the popup
[05:24:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, because the default value for the theme is inherit.
[05:24:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and so it's "ui-overlay-" + this.options.overlayTheme
[05:24:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The null is interesting.
[05:25:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll fix it.
[05:28:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't see the default "inherit"
[05:28:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looks like we set it in _themeClassFromOption
[05:29:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[05:29:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wait - the null in container has nothing to do with the theme.
[05:30:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's probably the wrapper class.
[05:30:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok

[05:41:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6212#issuecomment-21667799 the input buttons still get ui-btn-inherit class if no theme is set
[05:41:43] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6212 by mrextreme (2w 3d ago): Button text not correctly aligned to center
[05:43:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: shouldnt it get inherit if no theme is set?
[05:43:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no
[05:44:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's only for ui-body- and ui-bar-
[05:44:41] <arschmitz> ah ok ill fix it
[05:45:17] <arschmitz> i thought buttons got inherit
[05:45:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the reason is that because for buttons I can use .ui-btn but for body and bar I would have to use a lot of selectors (for each element that can have body or bar theme)
[05:46:10] <uGoMobi> have to admit that I don't like this incosistency
[05:46:17] <arschmitz> gotcha 
[05:46:23] <uGoMobi> but better than adding classes to buttons if not needed
[05:46:30] <arschmitz> yeah i thought the default if nothing was set was inherit

[05:54:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: one other question about content widget
[05:54:32] <arschmitz> no problem
[05:54:33] <arschmitz> sure
[05:55:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in panel I use self._page().parent().content(); to set theme
[05:55:24] <arschmitz> ok
[05:55:25] <uGoMobi> and in other cases I use $.mobile.pageContainer
[05:55:48] <arschmitz> $.mobile.pageContainer is deprecated
[05:56:04] <uGoMobi> ah ok, I missed that one
[05:56:13] <arschmitz> its because it makes no sense any more
[05:56:24] <arschmitz> because there can be 10 page containers
[05:56:33] <uGoMobi> yeah true

[05:57:06] <arschmitz> however im kinda thinking that maybe we should set some sort of container property on the page
[05:57:14] <arschmitz> to make it easy to access the parent container
[05:57:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah that might be a good idea
[05:57:31] <arschmitz> need to think about that more though
[05:57:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think I can also use self._page().closest( ":mobile-content" )
[05:57:59] <arschmitz> but i ran into the same thing some where that i needed a huge chain to get container
[05:58:21] <uGoMobi> the content widget should already be initialized when enhancing a panel
[05:58:22] <arschmitz> no that would throw an execption if you were not using pages
[05:58:46] <uGoMobi> right, but without a page no panel
[05:59:06] <arschmitz> thought we decided to allow it but overlay only
[05:59:14] <arschmitz> though i think we have not actually made that work yet 
[05:59:20] <uGoMobi> oh that might work indeed
[05:59:51] <uGoMobi> we don't do anything to not allow it
[06:00:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok for now I just look for the page parent
[06:00:06] <uGoMobi> thanks
[06:00:25] <arschmitz> yeah just have not tested so it might fail when when looking for a page if none exists at all
[06:00:38] <arschmitz> not sure how its written if it would error or not
[06:01:05] <uGoMobi> yeah, most code is wrapper in if ( o.display !== "overlay" )
[06:01:14] <uGoMobi> wrapped*
[06:01:29] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:01:38] <uGoMobi> but maybe there are few places were we still expect a page
[06:01:56] <uGoMobi> something for 1.5 when we review panel for the 5th time :)
[06:02:10] <arschmitz> lol yeah
[06:02:22] <arschmitz> panel and swipe just cant seem to escape them
[06:13:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i just added an item to the release checklist to do a PR for jsbin to update with current version
[06:15:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry, what do you mean?
[06:15:31] <uGoMobi> do you mean JS Fiddle?
[06:15:50] <arschmitz> no
[06:15:59] <arschmitz> jsfiddle is not open source or on github
[06:16:02] <arschmitz> but jsbin is
[06:16:17] <arschmitz> so we can do a PR to update the dropdown with new versions when they are released
[06:16:20] <arschmitz> UI does this
[06:16:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh wait, I just see that now
[06:16:39] <uGoMobi> I never used it
[06:16:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good idea
[06:16:57] <arschmitz> yeah im filing an issue there for the ajax
[06:17:12] <arschmitz> ui does a pr with each release
[06:17:13] <uGoMobi> yeah, would be great if that would work again
[06:17:17] <arschmitz> so we should too
[06:17:56] <arschmitz> and yeah hoping they will fix it kinda a big issue for us
[06:18:02] <uGoMobi> yeah, just didn't realize that you can include a library with JS Bin because I always put script in the head
[06:18:20] <arschmitz> oh yeah thats all it does on jsbin
[06:18:27] <arschmitz> it just pastes the js and css into the head

[06:19:38] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:24:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we have a bunch of tickets right now to remove things and they are now deprecated but cant removed until 1.5 for backcompat
[06:25:02] <arschmitz> should we keep these tickets open you think
[06:26:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, but we could rename to remove instead of deprecate
[06:26:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we should open tickets at API docs repo
[06:26:25] <arschmitz> they already say remove
[06:26:28] <uGoMobi> because we need to deprecate in the documentation
[06:26:33] <arschmitz> not deprecate
[06:26:55] <arschmitz> maybe just a single ticket with the deprecated list from change log?
[06:26:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh ok
[06:27:13] <arschmitz> just because that would be like 30 issues lol
[06:27:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, that's fine if it is about something we just need to remove
[06:28:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: there are some where we need to make changes first before we can remove
[06:28:16] <uGoMobi> like deprecate links.js
[06:28:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was kinda thinking make a ticket milestone 1.5 to do a code search for deprecated
[06:28:26] <arschmitz> and remove all deprecated code
[06:28:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sounds good
[06:29:13] <arschmitz> cool just seems pointless to keep all the tickets around
[06:29:32] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:29:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in case we need to add new code first we should have a ticket for that
[06:30:12] <uGoMobi> links.js contains code for popup ARIA stuff
[06:30:27] <arschmitz> and selfish reason like 15 are assigned to me and i hate seeing my name with that many lol
[06:30:30] <uGoMobi> that should be handled by the popup widget
[06:30:36] <uGoMobi> lol

[06:59:55] <_|Nix|_> Well, we have an easier job, too. Not like we need to haul ass like 4km (~= 2.5mi) away.
[07:00:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: 2.5 miles ha! try 30+ where im from :)
[07:00:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Really? Wow! Are the roads any good?
[07:00:49] <arschmitz> yeah roads are fine paved highways and stuff
[07:01:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, then that should be OK. I mean, if they can go 65 ...
[07:01:10] <_|Nix|_> (mph)
[07:01:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and they probably go waaay faster than that on highways.
[07:01:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: eh 50 - 55 on those roads but still generally a little over a half hour drive to closest city
[07:01:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Dang!
[07:02:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats normal in my state there are areas that are much much further 30 minutes isn't even considered a long commute for work

[07:04:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but I'm sure emergency vehicles can traverse similar distances in much shorter times if the pavement and stuff is not full of potholes.
[07:04:18] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[07:04:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I happen to know that drivers' discipline when it comes to yielding to emergency vehicles is much better on that side of the Atlantic - at least when compared to Finland.
[07:05:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, that may simply have to do with the general lack of shoulders on this side of the Atlantic.
[07:05:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was surprised to find that, when I first started driving here.
[07:05:58] <scott_gonzalez> Issues like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6340 are a bit concerning. There should actually be specific issues filed to remove each piece of functionality.
[07:05:59] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #6340 by arschmitz (7m 33s ago): Search library for deprecated code 
[07:06:48] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: we were just trying to consolidte some issues and going to refrence that in all of them
[07:06:54] <_|Nix|_> That should be marked as a dev task.
[07:07:12] <_|Nix|_> Done.
[07:08:25] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: We use dev task issues a bit like TODO items.
[07:08:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: like all the ones we / you filed last week to remove things i was in the process of writing comments on them 
[07:09:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you could use markdown task list
[07:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> Why not just label the actual issues?
[07:09:39] <uGoMobi> check list I mean
[07:09:56] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: there is no particular reason one way or there other we were just trying to consolidate
[07:11:35] <arschmitz> but if you think its better to keep separate issues thats just as easy just semantics of how we track them. however i guess by keeping separate you can reference and close them with a commit 
[07:12:01] <arschmitz> which makes the history cleaner and its easier to track a change and why it was done
[07:12:02] <uGoMobi> I agree with scott_gonzalez that we shouldn't have generic issue tickets like this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5293#issuecomment-22550259
[07:12:02] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5293 by arschmitz (8mon 3w ago): All Widgets should have a _destroy() method and use _on()
[07:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, that's actually one that I'm less worried about.
[07:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> Those are internal.
[07:13:05] <uGoMobi> why?
[07:13:17] <scott_gonzalez> The removal of deprecated functionality is a change in public API.
[07:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> Those each need their own issue.
[07:13:29] <uGoMobi> I see
[07:13:37] <arschmitz> that also makes sense
[07:14:01] <uGoMobi> I was more thinking about if it's something you can fix all at once or not
[07:14:31] <arschmitz> well easy enough i have not commented on any of the individual issues yet or closed them so ill just close the search for deprecated one 
[07:14:32] <uGoMobi> yeah good point

[12:55:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I am around.
[12:55:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[12:56:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so i randomly decided it was very bad that we did not have the option to style a page as a dialog in 1.4 since dialog widget is deprecated
[12:56:37] <arschmitz> the whole point of deprecation is to give people a version to switch
[12:56:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i am now
[12:56:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's true.
[12:57:05] <arschmitz> so i wrote a page extension to allow data-dialog="true"
[12:57:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool!
[12:57:22] <arschmitz> yeah was crazy simple it turns out
[12:57:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: /Now/ we can deprecate the dialog widget.
[12:57:35] <arschmitz> like probably less then 10 minutes
[12:57:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *nod* ... awesome!
[12:57:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just a sec and ill push so you can see

[12:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I'm not sure the IS_OLD_IE flag is necessary.
[12:59:33] <scott_gonzalez> processEventHook() should just check scope.externalEventDispatcher
[13:00:07] <scott_gonzalez> ms.js and touch.js can just check for existence of the relevant event types.
[13:00:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: sounds good, i can make those changes easily
[13:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> Why the IIFEs around https://github.com/kborchers/PointerEvents/compare/oldIE#L4R220 ?

[13:02:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: don't remember … probably not necessary
[13:03:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looks good. You basically derived the dialog widget from the page widget rather than the base class - as it should be.
[13:03:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah was able to just copy and paste most of it from dialog
[13:04:04] <arschmitz> added enhanced option
[13:08:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Very nice.
[13:08:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait ... if dialog has enhanced option, shouldn't page have it too?

[13:13:56] <scott_gonzalez> I haen't dug into the Polymer code, so I'm not sure what it'll need. At a minimum it'll need to know if the default action was prevented.
[13:14:08] <arschmitz> frequent whats up?
[13:14:35] <frequent> I was wondering about collapsible-sets. I ported my collapsible-horiztonal = tabs widget to latest JQM today
[13:14:49] <_|Nix|_> Argh! Fixes 6247 not 6274 :(
[13:14:53] <frequent> and it's only 5 lines of JS to make a collapsible-set into horizontal tabs

[13:16:02] <frequent> +5 tabs could collapse to regular collapsible-set
[13:16:31] <frequent> and 5 lines of JS I guess :-)
[13:16:44] <arschmitz> frequent: mind you we will in the future be shareing all widgets with ui so current collapsible will probably go away and ui tabs is here to stay
