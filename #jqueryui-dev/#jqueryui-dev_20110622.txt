[07:05:17] <kborchers> rworth: yt?
[07:05:35] <rworth> kborchers: hey
[07:06:02] <kborchers> due to this bug http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4447, using ui-icon-bullet for checked radios in menu causes them to be out of alignement with unchecked radios. thoughts?
[07:07:45] <kborchers> use the ugly unckecked radio icon until fixed or use the bullet and be out of alignment until fixed?
[07:07:51] <rworth> let's fix this right have either two or three icons for radio but have the -on one be filled in, rather that abuse ui-icon-bullet (thought I recognized that's the closest existing icon we have)
[07:08:07] <kborchers> ok
[07:08:53] <kborchers> are there css folks that can add those since i don't think the sprite is open for editing right?
[07:10:38] <kborchers> until those can be added then i will just use the existing radio icons
[07:43:34] <kborchers> rworth: new version with the changes we talked about in the meeting (minus changing the icon) http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/38wcx/6/. Now to tackle the fancy, bouncy "spotlight-like" text input version. ;)
