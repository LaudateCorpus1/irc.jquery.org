[05:22:09] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: Branched 1-8-stable and updated Position, added Menu, Tooltip and Spinner. Also added Widget, but that's very incomplete
[05:22:49] <jzaefferer> Will work on documenting 1.9 redesigns later
[06:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: awesome
[09:03:48] <Justin_o> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez: was the accordion widget tested with the ORCA screen reader?
[09:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> Justin_o: Not sure. We generally test with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver.
[09:15:21] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: thanks… those are the big ones.. I just noticed that I couldn't arrow to the other accordion panels to open them up. I'm not sure if it's something to do with my setup (linux vm on a macbook pro), me not using ORCA properly, or some other issue.
[09:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> Are you testing against 1.8.x or master?
[09:31:55] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: 1.8.19
[09:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> Justin_o: Does http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/accordion/default.html work better for you?
[09:36:23] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: yes that works.. I do still need to arrow down through each line of the content of the panel to get to the header of the panel below, but when i get there i can activate it to open
[09:37:04] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[09:37:27] <scott_gonzalez> Are there other accordions where you can navigate through the headers more easily?
[09:37:47] <scott_gonzalez> I guess ORCA is ignoring our key handler for the arrow keys.

[09:42:20] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Accordion tests: equalHeights() -> equalHeight(); Validate against a specific height instead of a range. - Scott González
[09:42:39] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: i tried to find something from dojo but the example i found didn't work. http://livedocs.dojotoolkit.org/dijit/layout/AccordionContainer
[09:51:33] <scott_gonzalez> Justin_o: If you or someone else could take a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/666 that'd be really helpful.
[09:51:34] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (3d, 16h ago): Tabs: ARIA! DO NOT MERGE TO MASTER!
[09:58:30] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: such an unfortunate pull request number ;) i'll try to take a look at it
[09:58:39] <scott_gonzalez> heh, yeah :-P
[10:05:15] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: so that works the same as the one from master
[10:05:39] <scott_gonzalez> Master doesn't have any ARIA at all.
[10:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> And you navigate through the tabs using the tab key in master.
[10:06:43] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: I think orca must be doing some sort of DOM inspection on it's own.. i've noticed that with our Decapod app it's reading off some content as though it were in a live region.. and there isn't any aria there either
[10:07:03] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[10:07:15] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: had to use the tab key for both master and your pull request.. the arrows didn't work for the tab demo (for going left/right)
[10:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like ORCA really doesn't like the page to handle arrow keys.
[10:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> Also, it's strange that tab worked against the pull request. Everything is taken out of the tab order except for the focused tab.
[10:12:08] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: oops my mistake.. wrong branch.. let me try again.. for some reason when i checkout your repo i don't get the tabs-aria branch
[10:12:19] <Justin_o> it's not even there when i do a git branch -a
[10:17:00] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: okay.. so i downloaded the zipped up version from your repo.. tested out the tabs demo.. so the arrow keys work, but they work like the accordion did.. so on the "Ajax tab" when pushing left/right you have to go through each letter before you can get to the next tab
[10:18:32] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like ORCA is using a specific navigation mode that forces the arrow keys to always have a specific behavior.
[10:21:15] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: yes.. it does seem like that.. i couldn't find much info about the keyboard navigation for orca.. joseph aka clown, who works here at the IDRC, is making a screen magnifier for Gnome. I'll check with him to see if he knows more about how ORCA works.. unfortunately he's on vacation at the moment. I think he'll be back in a week or so though.
[10:21:34] <scott_gonzalez> ok
