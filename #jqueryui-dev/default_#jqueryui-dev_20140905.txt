[00:15:41] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #602: STILL UNSTABLE in 19 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/602/
[02:42:46] <marcospgp> hey, I'm trying to edit the draggable widget because there is a small bug with my page that isn't a formal bug, just something that happens due to how my page works. The thing is the source code seems pretty complicated and I can't seem to find my way around it /: how should I proceed?

[05:24:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[05:26:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: NM. I was gonna ask if it'd be OK to make a branch on jquery-ui so my modified demos showing the on-the-fly classes option update would work with view.jqueryui.com, but then I realized I don't have access to the jquery-ui repo, so I can't make any new branches there.
[05:27:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that version you made of classes wont work
[05:27:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what about nested widgets?
[05:28:11] <gabriel_schulhof> ar	You
[05:28:12] <gabriel_schulhof> You Sorry!
[05:28:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Sorry!
[05:28:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Connection issues
[05:28:21] <gabriel_schulhof> You mean collapsibles inside collapsibles?
[05:28:30] <gabriel_schulhof> That's a good point.
[05:28:41] <arschmitz> or any widget inside another widget of same type
[05:28:41] <gabriel_schulhof> We've had a bug exactly about such kind of selector overreaching.
[05:29:19] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: this was my first thought about optimizing but nothing involving a selector can possibly work
[05:32:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Keeping track of all elements inside a widget is a good idea for other reasons too, so it may be worth pursuing, but it's a lot of work.
[07:12:27] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll mikesherov: Should we fix this, close as won't fix since delay is going away, or just let it sit until the rewrite then close?
[07:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10585
[07:14:35] <tj_vantoll> Huh the delay option and cancel method in one ticket.
[07:15:37] <tj_vantoll> We should consider publicly deprecating the options we know we want to get rid of.
[07:16:01] <tj_vantoll> It would give us more justification to close tickets like this.
[07:16:30] <tj_vantoll> Because we do nothing to discourage their usage currently, so this seems like a valid ticket.
[10:45:58] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Did you see my comments above?
[10:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I hadn't. So deprecate them in 1.12?
[10:47:27] <tj_vantoll> I think we should.
[10:47:33] <tj_vantoll> We don't want anyone to use delay.
[10:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's discuss that next week.
[10:48:17] <tj_vantoll> Sounds good.
[11:10:30] <tj_vantoll> It looks like we never documented menu's items option, unless I'm missing something (http://api.jqueryui.com/menu/).
[11:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> gah
[11:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/229
[11:24:25] <jquicommit> [13api.jqueryui.com] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #229: Document menu's items option 02http://git.io/a_SYxQ
[11:24:32] <scott_gonzalez> We're also missing documentation about the fact that you can do .widget( "option", "foo.bar" )
[11:26:39] <tj_vantoll> For the menu wrappers I think we need to add a new class name.
[11:27:04] <tj_vantoll> Because I'm using a <div> I'm running into an issue where nested <div>s pick up styles they shouldn't.
[11:28:06] <tj_vantoll> ui-menu-item-wrapper maybe
[11:28:07] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: if your talking about what i think you are we already talked about that it would need a class for classes option anyway
[11:28:23] <tj_vantoll> Ah ok
[11:28:25] <arschmitz> ls
[11:28:26] <arschmitz> oops
[11:28:39] <tj_vantoll> :)
[11:28:43] <arschmitz> irc does a terrible job at listing my current directory
[11:29:56] <tj_vantoll> I'm going to go with ui-menu-item-wrapper and you all can suggest alternatives in the PR if you have better ideas.
[11:30:10] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: i think that sounds good
[11:30:25] <arschmitz> pretty sure thats what i would have gone with im not creative lol
[11:56:42] <scott_gonzalez> gabriel_schulhof: You're really clouding up the existing PR with comments abount various implementations that aren't in the PR.
[11:57:12] <scott_gonzalez> We're now up to a dozen comments (several screen heights) worth of content about it.
