[06:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> and then didn't run the tests :-(
[06:43:27] <jzaefferer> yeah :/
[07:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and others: what kind of horrible things might this cause? https://gist.github.com/a640f92084111a91bfea
[07:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> things like copying the stopPropagation() and preventDefault() methods over from the original event seem bad
[08:00:45] <kborchers> hey scott_gonzalez, did you ever get that user script working? If not, here is what I have https://gist.github.com/1383045 Could probably use a bunch of clean up but seems to work pretty well on the commits page and the PR page
[08:01:06] <kborchers> it doesn't quite work right if the ticket number gets chopped in the middle but ...
[08:01:29] <scott_gonzalez> nope, never got it working, I'll check it out :-)

[13:39:47] <jzaefferer> jQuery 2006, jQuery UI 2007, QUnit 2008, TestSwarm 2009, jQuery Mobile 2010?
[13:40:38] <scott_gonzalez> are we talking 1.0 dates, start dates, or first release of any type?
[13:41:10] <jzaefferer> whatever is convenient enough :p
[13:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> well, I think those dates are a mixture
[13:41:46] <jzaefferer> yeah, pretty much
[13:42:16] <jzaefferer> but first release of any type may come closest
[13:44:35] <scott_gonzalez> ah, yeah, Mobile did have releases last year
[13:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> didn't think they started till this year
[13:44:58] <scott_gonzalez> but the first alpha was in October
[13:45:52] <scott_gonzalez> heh, the jQuery Mobile announcement is the last thing on the project history
[13:45:57] <scott_gonzalez> http://jquery.org/history/
