[06:46:43] <jzaefferer> arschmitz_: I'm reviewing controlgroup again!
[06:47:17] <arschmitz_> ok
[06:47:50] <arschmitz_> jzaefferer: hopefully should not be much everything you and scott pointed out last time was trivial
[06:48:52] <jzaefferer> I guess that also applies to my comments so far
[06:53:56] <jzaefferer> arschmitz_: is jsbin broken or am I doing something wrong? http://jsbin.com/zasusaleyo/edit?html,js,output
[06:55:19] <arschmitz_> jzaefferer: invalid markup
[06:55:21] <arschmitz_> close you input
[06:55:33] <jzaefferer> doh
[06:55:37] <jzaefferer> wth
[06:55:57] <jzaefferer> well, that's a spinner inside a spinner
[06:56:29] <arschmitz_> working fine for me http://jsbin.com/kinaqi/edit?html,js,output
[07:01:03] <jzaefferer> That's type=text, with type=number you get both
[07:22:53] <arschmitz_> oh you need to disable the default style in the css to do that
[07:22:57] <arschmitz_> we do it in mobile
[07:30:01] <jzaefferer> arschmitz_: sounds like something spinner should deal with?
[07:30:27] <arschmitz_> if we want to support progressive enhancement yes
[07:31:42] <arschmitz_> jzaefferer: i know scott_gonzalez has expressed an opinion on this before though so might want to check with him
[07:32:03] <jzaefferer> sure
[07:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> Does it work in all browsers?
[07:32:26] <arschmitz_> scott_gonzalez: yeah but its a mess of prefixed props
[07:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> Can you link to the styles in Mobile?
[07:32:59] <arschmitz_> yup just a sec
[07:33:18] <scott_gonzalez> Let's talk to all the browser vendors that we can to make sure this will continue to work.
[07:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> Because I've had this discussion before and there has never been a consistent answer for removing all styling.
[07:34:27] <arschmitz_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.forms.slider.css#L30-L41
[07:34:46] <arschmitz_> yeah i need to check edge i hve not checked in edge to make sure this still works
[07:35:30] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[07:35:31] <arschmitz_> scott_gonzalez: yeah i knew i had talked to you about this before at some point
[07:35:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'm really skeptical of CSS appearance, because it was dropped from the spec that it was in.
[07:36:11] <arschmitz_> yeah so probable it will not continue to work 
[07:36:34] <jzaefferer> and there is no replacement?
[07:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> Nope.
[07:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> The planned replacement is web components.
[07:36:46] <jzaefferer> because webcomponents?
[07:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> But they don't have a solution to the problem of many form controls being based on an attribute (type) instead of the element name (input).
[07:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps our best option right now is to leave the selector that we have (.ui-spinner-input) and document that you can change it to input[type=number] and use CSS, but that it's nonstandard and therefore is not guaranteed to work everywhere or in the future.
[07:39:19] <arschmitz_> scott_gonzalez: im good with that
[07:39:38] <arschmitz_> if we didnt want to do it based on a class we could also do like data-type="number" or something or suggest it
[07:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> It's easy enough to customize. I'd rather let the community decide if they want to create a custom data attribute.
[07:41:40] <arschmitz_> sounds good to me
[07:41:56] <jzaefferer> +1
[07:42:05] <arschmitz_> obviously a class was my choice since it what i did lol
[07:42:12] <scott_gonzalez> :-)

[09:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, arschmitz_ jzaefferer: I meant to bring up https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1596 in the meeting.
[09:57:04] <scott_gonzalez> I think we should document the broken Chrome behavior on api.jqueryui.com but not change anything in the code.
[09:57:11] <scott_gonzalez> And we should petition for Chrome to stop being broken.
[09:57:11] <arschmitz_> yeah i have been following that one
[09:57:18] <arschmitz_> +1
[09:57:50] <arschmitz_> that seems totally wrong what chrome is doing
[10:01:57] <jzaefferer> What's the minimum IE release for 1.12? IE8?
[10:04:26] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez arschmitz_ ^
[10:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> And this will be the last version that supports IE8.
[10:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we can put that on the roadmap.
[10:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> Drop IE8 support in 1.13.
[10:36:04] <jzaefferer> done

[18:13:52] <arschmitz_> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: looks like dialog does not have a classes prop for the modal overlay we should probably fix that
