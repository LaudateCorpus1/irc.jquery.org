[01:05:05] <DarsVaeda> I think there is a bug in datepicker beforeShow -> http://jsfiddle.net/b5nzu9rw/ it returns a null date on initial run
[04:42:45] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Ping! Making the ID of the page unique seems to have fixed the problem - at least for me: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/9fe73265f138b763e1c1
[04:43:37] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I'm going home now, but I hope this works for you. I'll try to get back in the saddle a bit later.

[05:26:56] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: let's use this!
[05:27:12] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/ebb3335466f53d586950fd35981a3d0dc6eda29b doesn't help, still getting the same error. Odd...
[05:29:13] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: meanwhile: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/05b5ad8e8b4fa0c348eb
[05:29:29] <jzaefferer> have you tried with network throttle?
[05:37:39] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its working now?
[05:37:53] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: lets use what?
[05:40:02] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz closed issue #8174: $.mobile.navigate Issue into Latest Version of Chrome and Android Lolipop 02http://git.io/vthsr
[05:42:15] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: its not working, no. 
[05:43:16] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: with chrome dev tools open, there's UA and Network dropdowns at the top of the page (separate from dev tools itself). Picking "Good 3G" caused the error to always happen
[05:44:32] <arschmitz> hmm i dont know why the shim is not working
[05:45:05] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: can you reproduce the issue now?
[05:45:27] <arschmitz> yes
[05:46:06] <arschmitz> the shim should fix that
[05:57:30] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I found something
[05:58:11] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: there, that works: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/8449300825b13434ef47
[06:01:53] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: that does not work for me
[06:02:47] <arschmitz> that was one of the first things i tried :-/
[06:04:59] <arschmitz> hmm so i have only had it fail twice that way actually every other time passes
[06:05:32] <arschmitz> i cant get it to fail at all now but i also cant make it slower or it times out lol
[06:06:01] <arschmitz> so maybe those 2 times i hit the timeout not the dependency
[06:11:47] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i just pushed your change as well as a change to how we hide the demos on loading
[06:11:58] <arschmitz> so that it wont effect the demos on the website
[06:18:15] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: looks good now
[06:21:58] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: just a missing blank line now
[06:24:52] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: and lint issues in bootstrap.js
[06:30:42] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: with lint there is a bigger issue
[06:30:58] <arschmitz> in that there not actually anything wrong with it but it fails based on our settings
[06:31:36] <arschmitz> it does not use an amd wrapper ( because it loads it ) 
[06:32:05] <arschmitz> oh i guess i can just make another .jshintrc for the demos
[06:32:19] <jzaefferer> or do local overrides for just the one file
[06:32:23] <arschmitz> because it rightfully has some globals which is all its failing for
[06:32:42] <jzaefferer> just declare the globals
[06:32:45] <arschmitz> ok
[06:32:48] <jzaefferer> inside the file
[06:32:53] <arschmitz> i thought we didnt do that but im fine with it
[06:33:07] <jzaefferer> well, Scott can yell at us later :p
[06:33:35] <jzaefferer> its just document and window, right?
[06:33:59] <arschmitz> and $
[06:34:15] <arschmitz> also are you ok with me removing onevar from the main jshint rc
[06:34:21] <arschmitz> since its not valid anymore
[06:38:46] <arschmitz> ugh our jscs does not like it either
[06:39:37] <jzaefferer> do it in master?
[06:39:46] <arschmitz> sur
[06:40:16] <arschmitz> oh yikes
[06:40:21] <arschmitz> not upgrading jscs though
[06:40:28] <arschmitz> 121 errors if i do lol
[06:55:50] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: updated the pr
[07:10:45] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: could make "jquery" an explicit dependency in the require call and use that instead of a global
[07:10:50] <jzaefferer> not sure if worth it..
[07:11:18] <arschmitz> hmm yeah i could
[07:13:32] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: alternatively i could also just not use jQuery i guess
[07:13:40] <arschmitz> since i only use 2 lines
[07:14:38] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: thats what scott_gonzalez did for the test one
[07:14:44] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thoughts?
[07:16:49] <jzaefferer> what would the globalEval look like?
[07:18:01] <arschmitz> doing a true replacment would be a bit complicated
[07:18:12] <arschmitz> well kinda not really
[07:18:20] <arschmitz> the real one makes a script tag
[07:18:32] <arschmitz> and injects it rather then doing an actual eval
[07:19:13] <arschmitz> fairly simple but a lot more then the single call lol
[07:23:10] <jzaefferer> let's go with explicit dependency for jQuery then
[07:23:21] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/34bcd7570403af0a2787
[07:23:38] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: that would be what that function body would look like without jQuery
[07:23:40] <arschmitz> not too bad
[07:25:46] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i think i would go with just not using jQuery in this case as its actually fairly trivial i guess
[07:27:57] <jzaefferer> okay
[07:45:43] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: let me know when you've updated that, would be nice to finish it today
[07:48:44] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like you guys got it handled.
[07:48:46] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/13169
[07:49:23] <arschmitz> yeah i can comment again lol
[07:57:54] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: im guessing my user is corrupt AGAIN
[07:58:02] <arschmitz> since i cant login 
[07:58:10] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you logged out in the first place?
[07:58:25] <scott_gonzalez> It's going to be corrupt until the new Trac install is ready.
[07:58:38] <arschmitz> It logs me out any time i close the browser regardless of if i check stay logged in
[07:59:08] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: always has
[07:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[07:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> Your session should last forever.
[07:59:40] <arschmitz> that has never worked for me i have always had to log in every time
[08:00:26] <scott_gonzalez> Should be good to go now, with the same password as last time.
[08:00:41] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: don't close the browser!
[08:00:41] <arschmitz> yup thank you
[08:00:50] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: my laptop crashes all the time
[08:00:55] <arschmitz> i need a new one
[08:02:00] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i was going to buy one a while ago but with some recent changes i decided i had to hold off until i figured some things out
[08:18:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i just closed and comment on that ticket
[08:24:47] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i wonder if that difference is a bug in firefox or if that order is not defined in the standard?
[08:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> not sure

[11:40:32] <agcolom> arschmitz: I updated the notes, please check if you're happy with it. I can upload next week :-)
[11:44:26] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Weird ... lots of tests are failing now, whereas none were for me locally.
[11:48:30] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I'll take a look ...
[11:49:09] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: gabrielschulhof: Ping!
[11:49:24] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Pong! What's up?
[11:52:26] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: You are severely lagged. I CTCP pinged both you and jasperdegroot and I got a real time response from him, but none from you.
[11:52:57] <gabrielschulhof> Well, I guess that might mean you're filtering CTCP pings ...
[11:55:05] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: OK. I have to go now. I'm running the tests for enhancer-multiple-new and indeed, I'm seeing some failures. I'll try to find fixes for it when I get back.
[11:57:22] <arschmitz> JamesMGreene: gabrielschulhof: hey sorry
[11:57:30] <arschmitz> i was stuck in a loop apparently 
[12:00:47] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ^^ i mean
[12:16:58] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: dont worry about enhancer
[12:17:03] <arschmitz> i must have broke it in rebase
[12:17:13] <arschmitz> ill check it out it was all passing
[12:17:20] <arschmitz> with your fix
[13:09:21] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: OK. I'll keep going with popup.
[13:10:15] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: most of it was that i forgot cherry-pick ranges are not inclusive
[13:10:22] <gabrielschulhof> :)
[13:10:24] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: so i was missing the first commit
[13:10:35] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, that's a bit confusing.
[13:10:40] <gabrielschulhof> Same with diff ranges.
[13:10:46] <arschmitz> but im still getting a pile of flipswitch failures after applying to 1.5-dev
[13:10:54] <gabrielschulhof> Hmmm ...
[13:11:24] <arschmitz> and more rangeslider ones then i should too lol
[13:11:39] <arschmitz> ohhh
[13:11:52] <arschmitz> those got their classes updates and backcompat
[13:12:01] <arschmitz> which means their dependencies are out of date
[13:12:30] <arschmitz> the tests all rely on the deprecated data roles which means they depend on the enhancer-backcompat
[13:13:00] <arschmitz> and the new widget-crawler
[13:18:09] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah! OK, that's great. Just AMD changes.
[13:18:38] <gabrielschulhof> Wait though ... shouldn't widget avoid depending on enhancer-related stuff?
[13:18:52] <gabrielschulhof> ... so that they may be useful in stand-alone mode?
[13:19:02] <gabrielschulhof> I must be misunderstanding.
[13:19:34] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: the tests use nstest
[13:19:40] <arschmitz> but the update makes that deprecated
[13:19:49] <arschmitz> and they are setting backcompat=false
[13:20:19] <arschmitz> so its only looking for data-ui- not data-nestest despire $.mobile.ns being set
[13:20:56] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, OK.
[13:22:55] <gabrielschulhof> Wait a sec ... we're supposed to move references to $.mobile.ns to mobileBackcompat?
[13:23:11] <gabrielschulhof> I haven't been doing that in my PRs.
[13:23:18] <arschmitz> yeah we should be 
[13:23:24] <gabrielschulhof> At least, I haven't been making sure that that's done.
[13:23:31] <arschmitz> but thats new as of this pr essentially
[13:23:36] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Yet another thing to keep an eye out on.
[13:23:45] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:23:48] <gabrielschulhof> *whew* ... we should have a checklist ...
[13:23:54] <arschmitz> we will need to do searches before release
[13:24:03] <arschmitz> to look for deprecated code where it should not be
[13:24:24] <arschmitz> for the most part thats pretty easy with a simple search
[13:37:23] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yup simply doing a search and replace for nstest/ui on pages with backcompat=false fixes the tests
[13:38:05] <gabrielschulhof> Cool!
[13:39:37] <gabrielschulhof> I also need to update the popup tests to be backcompat-aware.
[14:02:24] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: all green execpt the 3 rangeslider tests
[14:07:57] <gabrielschulhof> Super-cool!
[14:10:42] <jquicommit> [13jqueryui.com] 15Nicrob64 opened issue #118: Requests blocked over https 02http://git.io/vqf31
[14:11:19] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I just had an idea. Should we do a redirect for $.mobileBackcompat the way we do for push-state-disabled?
[14:11:33] <gabrielschulhof> After all, the tests that work without backcompat must also work with backcompat.
[14:11:43] <gabrielschulhof> Then, we need a separate suite for just the backcompat.
[14:12:01] <gabrielschulhof> That's a killer on test runtime though.
[14:12:08] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i was thinking about that but that was my concern
[14:12:27] <arschmitz> in ui theyonly set backcompat false when there is backcompat
[14:12:33] <arschmitz> but we may want to set it by default
[14:12:46] <arschmitz> because of the much more complex dependency structure we have
[14:12:55] <arschmitz> and then only turn it on where we want
[14:13:13] <arschmitz> full runs of both would be ideal
[14:13:22] <arschmitz> but it seems like you said a killer to run times
[14:13:33] <arschmitz> maybe only do it with one version of jQuery or something?
[14:16:11] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah. Might be worth it.
[14:18:45] <gabrielschulhof> TBH though it seems like a huge overhaul ... OTOH, there's no better way of testing ...
