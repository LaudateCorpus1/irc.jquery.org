[01:23:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: just want to verify, there should be no reason to keep old.jqueryui.com around correct?
[02:20:41] <jzaefferer> gnarf: before shutting off old.jqueryui.com for good, we should add a redirect to the regular site and see if and how loud people complain, so that we can keep it around a little longer if any valid issues come up
[02:37:34] <gnarf> i was thinking about just removing the dns
[02:37:41] <gnarf> we can always add it back

[06:31:24] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/149#issuecomment-14176047
[06:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf jzaefferer: Removing DNS for old sounds good.
[06:33:43] <gnarf> rxaviers: yeah
[06:33:51] <gnarf> rxaviers: i think you published the old .deb on your dropbox?
[06:33:56] <gnarf> or did you just upload it for me
[06:33:58] <gnarf> and i did it
[06:34:02] <rxaviers> I have no dropbox :(
[06:34:05] <gnarf> either way, point me at the .deb
[06:34:06] <rxaviers> it's on my home
[06:34:18] <rxaviers> at jq02.stage.jquery.com
[06:34:21] <gnarf>  /home/rxaviers on jq02?
[06:34:23] <rxaviers> does it work?
[06:34:50] <rxaviers> please use imagemagick_6.6.9-10-1_amd64.deb
[06:35:59] <gnarf> rxaviers: i'll do that after 2 more
[06:36:32] <rxaviers> :)
[06:36:42] <rxaviers> ok then, plz just let me knwo if needing anything
[06:43:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: old.jqueryui.com is gone now

[12:08:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: can you clarify something real quick?
[12:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[12:09:09] <kborchers> talking about the redesigns and 1.x releases you said "We will continue to follow that pattern until EVERYTHING has gone through API redesigns."
[12:09:19] <kborchers> and then "When we drop the last of the back compat, we will be at 2.0.0."
[12:09:32] <kborchers> is that except datepicker?
[12:09:54] <scott_gonzalez> Well, datepicker probably won't have back compat.
[12:10:05] <kborchers> right
[12:10:12] <kborchers> i guess what i'm asking is
[12:10:52] <kborchers> when you say "When we drop the last of the back compat, we will be at 2.0.0." but then the roadmap lists 2.0 as having datepicker, form controls, i18n what does that mean is actually 2.0?
[12:12:01] <kborchers> i'm just running through this stuff quickly in my talk to paint the picture leading up to where we are in the interaction redesigns
[12:12:10] <kborchers> and want to get it right
[12:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> Well, datepicker (and maybe some other form controls) will be in 2.0.
[12:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> And interactions will lose their back compat in 2.0
[12:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> Because they're being redesigned in the version prior.
[12:16:01] <kborchers> ok makes sense
[12:16:08] <kborchers> just wanted to make sure i understood
[12:16:10] <kborchers> thanks
[12:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
