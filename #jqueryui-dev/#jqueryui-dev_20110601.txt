[08:34:38] <jzaefferer> ajpiano, can you take care of announcing the two meetings on twitter?
[08:34:56] <ajpiano> surey

[08:52:28] <gnarf> omg!

[09:08:26] <gnarf> btw... http://jqbug.com/ui/p203 -- I'm out of reasons to stop this pull
[09:08:41] <gnarf> still seems odd to me, but at least its oddly consistent
[09:46:41] <mandragorn> to help update http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137778/Datepicker do I request access through the site or is there another way to update/propose changes?
[09:47:14] <gnarf> mandragorn: if you want wiki edit access, just apply on the wiki
[09:47:29] <mandragorn> ok
