[02:07:53] <jzaefferer> hey rxaviers! welcome back
[02:08:12] <rxaviers> hi jzaefferer! thks
[02:08:15] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: if you want to see some history for ThemeRoller, I just stumbled upon this: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138090/Themeroller
[02:08:22] <rxaviers> ok
[02:10:42] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: how are you? I hope you enjoyed your time since the summit

[05:51:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: What is this about? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8441
[05:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand:  if you're drag-dropping with html5 into a sortable (creating a new item in the sortable on dragover and calling newItem.dragStart())
[05:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> Is this a draggable connected to a sortable? But with the draggable not being jQuery UI draggable?

[07:01:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: "Is this a draggable connected to a sortable? But with the draggable not being jQuery UI draggable?" <- yeah, that was my understanding
[07:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> Why would you wnat to do that?
[07:11:42] <jzaefferer> sort images to upload?
[07:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> With native dragging on an <input type="file">?
[07:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you mean dragging from the desktop?
[07:14:34] <jzaefferer> Yeah, that's what the "html5" implied to me
[07:14:44] <jzaefferer> Dragging from desktop
[07:20:13] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ugh
[07:20:24] <mikesherov> Testswarm is getting on my nerves
[07:20:50] <mikesherov> We need to get away from the runner running the tests in an iframe period
[07:21:21] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: talk to Krinkle about that, he's planning that anyway
[07:21:50] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: see https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/195
[07:25:57] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov, jzaefferer: Thoughts on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/807/files ?
[07:26:07] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically the location of the resizable + draggable test.
[07:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like it should be in the draggable test suite, not the resizable test suite.
[07:29:24] <mikesherov> I agre scott_gonzalez, but I'd go a step further, and make a test suite specifically for interactions between interactions
[07:29:41] <mikesherov> when we really test this thing, we'll want to make sure they all work together
[07:30:12] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I feel like the current solution is a hack, which I'd like to get rid of in the rewrite.
[07:30:29] <scott_gonzalez> Draggable shouldn't have code specifically for working with resizable.
[07:30:35] <mikesherov> sure
[07:30:46] <mikesherov> that should be handled by the ddmanager, no?
[07:31:23] <mikesherov> if we're going to handle it in the rewrite, then I'm fine letting the test stay where it is
[07:31:29] <scott_gonzalez> Well, draggable already has a cancel option. The resizable handle should just be in there.
[07:31:29] <mikesherov> but I see your point
[07:32:36] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: true
[07:32:55] <mikesherov> The test should end up in the suite where the eventual workaround would be written
[07:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally though two interactions never fight with each other.
[07:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> I wish we could reliably store data on events...
[07:33:26] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I wish for a lot of things
[07:33:30] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:33:36] <mikesherov> blame the powers at be
[07:34:34] <mikesherov> so, the testswarm fix didn't fix stuff‚Ä¶ jzaefferer sorry about that‚Ä¶ it was working on my local testswarm tests to fix the position stuff‚Ä¶ we should just revert for now.
[07:34:38] <mikesherov> sorry about that
[07:35:27] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: I would also recommend commenting out that position test until I can fix testswarm reliably (stop using an iframe altogether)
[07:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: How about I do something a little more ghetto and comment it out for all IE.
[07:38:17] <scott_gonzalez> That way we at least know if it actually breaks.
[07:38:41] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: sure, makes sense
[07:38:52] <mikesherov> but let's revert the testswarm change I made too
[07:39:09] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: can you do that since you have access to swarm?
[07:39:53] <mikesherov> and I'll take on that testswarm ticket to fix this once and for all
[07:40:04] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: sure
[07:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? http://john.onolan.org/ghost/
[07:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> Why is that whole page just images?
[07:41:19] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: because it's vaporware
[07:41:42] <mikesherov> notice the constant use of the words "would be" instead of "is"
[07:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, yup, at the bottom in the FAQ it says it doesn't exist.
[07:43:13] <scott_gonzalez> Still doesn't explain why there's no actual text on that page though.
[07:44:35] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Do you want me to revert your commit in the testswarm reop?
[07:44:47] <mikesherov> yes, scott_gonzalez
[07:45:42] <mikesherov> thanks
[07:47:02] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'm working on https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/issues/20 - can I see the content of customFields in WordPress admin?
[07:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> Reverted and updated the server.
[07:47:36] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #761: STILL FAILING in 46 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/761/
[07:47:36] <doesallmagic> Scott Gonz√°lez: Dialog: Don't use .attr( props, true ).
[07:48:15] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: When viewing a post, click on the Screen Options button on the top right.
[07:48:27] <scott_gonzalez> Then check the Custom Fields checkbox.
[07:48:37] <scott_gonzalez> It should list the fields on the bottom of the page.
[07:48:49] <jzaefferer> Thanks, never noticed that button before
[07:49:16] <jzaefferer> So that works
[07:53:46] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: can you take a look at this? https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/pull/26
[07:54:24] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: ^^^ maybe you have a suggestion to make the xsl less ugly? that second if to insert the comma is ghetto :/
[07:54:43] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: sure, I'll take a look.
[07:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You need to use `//entry` instead of `/entry`
[07:55:49] <kswedberg> btw, it seems that changes need to be tagged in order to use them in api.jquery.com? otherwise doing npm update does nothing.
[07:56:17] <kswedberg> is there some other recommended way for me to work with latest grunt-jquery-content?
[07:56:19] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You can't get much less ghetto with conditional commas, but this is what I do in other places: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/47895629771996fc616262adf8fef053de2d25cb/tasks/jquery-xml/entries2html-base.xsl#L787-790
[07:56:47] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: You can link to your local checkout.
[07:57:04] <scott_gonzalez> From your grunt-jquery-content directory: npm link (creates a global link to the checkout)
[07:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> From your api.jquery.com directory: npm link grunt-jquery-content (creates a link to the previously created global link)
[07:57:28] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: oh, cool. thanks!
[07:58:06] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: //entry would work for nested entry elements, but that's exactly what my PR comment is about. Where do we expect those attributes to be? We can only have one of those per document.
[07:58:26] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: I'll add that to the grunt-jquery-content readme
[07:58:44] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: It'll be on whichever entry is deprecated/removed.
[08:03:33] <jzaefferer> kswedberg scott_gonzalez: updated: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/pull/26/files
[08:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Looks good.
[08:06:14] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: looks good to me, too.
[08:07:21] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I think I understand what jzaefferer means, though. The point of this custom field was to allow us to add a class or something to a containing element in web-base-template.
[08:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> You mean on the individual entry div/section?
[08:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> That should just happen in the XSLT.
[08:08:36] <kswedberg> ‚Ä¶ but .closest(), for example, has two <entry> nodes, only one of which has a removed attr
[08:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> Right, the XSLT can handle that, since it has access to everything.
[08:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> We can just apply the class during the processing, rather than trying to add metadata and applying it in PHP.
[08:11:58] <kswedberg> hmmm. ok. then why did we want to add this as a custom field in the first place?
[08:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> I thought you wanted it for the category/search pages.
[08:12:58] <kswedberg> I'm so confused.
[08:13:02] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[08:13:17] <kswedberg> brb
[08:13:20] <scott_gonzalez> If you just want styling on the entry page, then that should happen in XSL.
[08:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> If you want styling on a listing page, then we need metadata.
[08:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> But listing pages don't know about the concept of multi-entry posts.
[08:20:23] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: right. I'm thinking that the metadata should only be added if <entry deprecated/removed> is top-level.
[08:20:51] <kswedberg> or if top-level <entries deprecated/removed>
[08:21:59] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so /entries@deprecated would be new, but seems reasonable.
[08:22:00] <kswedberg> because we really just want to throw up a warning flag if there's nothing on the page that people should use.
[08:22:13] <kswedberg> right
[08:22:21] <scott_gonzalez> But again, is this for the entry page or the listing page?
[08:22:26] <kswedberg> listing page
[08:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:22:36] <kswedberg> upi
[08:22:46] <kswedberg> oops. you were right about that
[08:23:10] <kswedberg> gotta run. bbl

[11:21:44] <scott_gonzalez> He has a PR that I'm going to land.
[11:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I closed the PR and asked him to send a new one.
[11:22:23] <mikesherov> OK, great, I just wasn't sure
[11:22:40] <mikesherov> He should be putting ticket tests in *_tickets.js, not core
[11:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/807#issuecomment-10081536
[11:22:54] <scott_gonzalez> We don't use _tickets.js anymore.

[11:23:14] <mikesherov> Oh, OK
[11:23:18] <mikesherov> Good to know!
[11:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> The idea being that the fact that the test was written because of a ticket is irrelevant.
[11:23:55] <scott_gonzalez> It's either related to an option, event, method, or general behavior (core).
[11:25:36] <mikesherov> yeah, I agree
[11:25:41] <mikesherov> I was just following convention
[11:26:09] <mikesherov> So, should we go through and ask for tests on all the open pulls on interactions?

[12:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Thoughts on what we should do about this? http://swarm.jquery.org/result/410495
[12:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> It's a bug in core 1.6.1 and 1.6.2
[12:20:34] <scott_gonzalez> We can patch it in UI core.
[12:20:44] <mikesherov> sure, do a version check for which version of UI it is, and compare
[12:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can patch it directly in tooltip, since that's the only one affected by it.
[12:21:20] <mikesherov> Oh, I see
[12:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, just doubling up on .removeData()s in tooltip might be fewer bytes that actually fixing it in UI core.
[12:21:42] <mikesherov> wait, this is current UI vs. core 1.6.1?
[12:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> This is the .removeData( "foo-bar" ) not working.
[12:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:22:08] <mikesherov> right, so I assume we're still supporting 1.6.1 and 1.6.2?
[12:22:21] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9413
[12:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, 1.6+
[12:22:49] <mikesherov> Yeah, then I would fix it in core
[12:22:54] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:23:00] <mikesherov> UI core that is
[12:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> right
[12:26:21] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/N9dRyQ
[12:26:21] <jquicommit> jquery-ui/master 8a32c39 Scott Gonz√°lez: Core: Moved old jQuery support code to the bottom (above deprecated).
[12:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, how I love duck punching core.
[12:28:25] <mikesherov> It's so dirty..
[12:28:44] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: can you add some more commenting specifically about which version each punch supports?
[12:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, each one has a "support: XXX" comment.
[12:29:28] <mikesherov> Oh, great
[12:29:49] <mikesherov> you obviously thought of that already, LOL
[12:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: https://gist.github.com/8d4a29e6b0d7a6147b8b
[12:33:20] <mikesherov> I like that swap style
[12:33:27] <mikesherov> never saw that before, but makes sense
[12:33:50] <mikesherov> I usually see the var _old = $.fn.whatev; $.fn.whatev = ....
[12:34:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, every time I proxy something, I debate which style to use :-P
[12:35:33] <mikesherov> I think that makes sense...
[12:35:43] <scott_gonzalez> It makes the tests pass :-)

[12:36:02] <doesallmagic> Scott Gonz√°lez: Core: Moved old jQuery support code to the bottom (above deprecated).
[12:36:37] <mikesherov> great! then let's do it
[12:37:52] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! in the api docs, do you document methods that are deprecated with a note saying it is deprecated in the current version?
[12:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> yup

[12:38:58] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: thx
[12:39:09] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries/disableSelection.xml#L5
[12:39:27] <scott_gonzalez> Also, that method has the best documentation ever! :-P
[12:39:52] <agcolom> Oh yes!!!! I love this!!!
[12:41:13] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I'm very proud of myself! I've managed to do all sorts with git this weekend without breaking anything and without any help!!!!
[12:41:24] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:41:52] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Do you know how to edit the Trac web page template?
[12:41:55] <agcolom> (I'm only fairly new to it! used to give me so much stress! Now I love it!!!!)
[12:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> The logo on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ links to ui.jquery.com/home, which is a few years old :-/
[12:42:34] <mikesherov> agcolom: git is the worlds biggest footgun
[12:42:56] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yes, that's in trac.ini I think
[12:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, Linus doesn't care about developer ergonomics.
[12:42:58] <mikesherov> one sec
[12:47:22] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: where is trac.ini again?
[12:47:35] <mikesherov> gnarf: yt?
[12:47:47] <mikesherov> ryanneufeld: yt?
[12:47:48] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea.
[12:47:53] <ryanneufeld> yes
[12:47:54] <ryanneufeld> I am here
[12:48:07] <mikesherov> ryanneufeld: can you reset my password on bugs.jquery.com
[12:48:13] <ryanneufeld> maybew
[12:48:14] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..I can't ssh to bugs.jqueryui.com.
[12:48:16] <mikesherov> and PM me a tmp one?
[12:48:25] <mikesherov> ssh bugs.jquery.com it's the same box scott
[12:48:58] <scott_gonzalez> I mean my password isn't accepted.

[12:49:34] <ryanneufeld> mike I pm
[12:49:40] <ryanneufeld> you a new one
[12:49:49] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: you want a reset?
[12:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....it's 05, right? I was able to SSH to that.
[12:50:38] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: false, it's 04
[12:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> That's odd, 05 has /var/www/bugs.jqueryui.com
[12:51:14] <ryanneufeld> current 04 isn't on puppet
[12:51:17] <scott_gonzalez> Heh: Could not resolve hostname jq04.jquery.com
[12:51:48] <ryanneufeld> www-04.jquery.net
[12:52:50] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: you don't have an account on that box
[12:53:03] <scott_gonzalez> oh well :-P
[12:54:34] <ryanneufeld> ping me if you need anything else :)
[12:56:47] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Did you find it?
[12:57:00] <mikesherov> should be in: /var/www/bugs.jqueryui.com/public/htdocs/
[12:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> It should be in /var/www/bugs.jqueryui.com/private/conf
[12:57:10] <mikesherov> looking for the name via grep now
[12:57:13] <mikesherov> it's not in the conf
[12:57:18] <mikesherov> it's a custom template
[12:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[12:58:18] <mikesherov> it's in /private/templates‚Ä¶. I got it
[12:58:23] <mikesherov> what do you want it to link to?
[12:58:30] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/
[13:01:33] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: changed it, and then restarted trac
[13:01:37] <mikesherov> looks like it took
[13:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[13:01:42] <mikesherov> np
[13:03:23] <mikesherov> ryanneufeld: how do we backup changes we make to these templates?‚Ä¶ /cc gnarf
[13:03:35] <mikesherov> I'm nervous about the bugs box
[13:04:02] <mikesherov> I know I've personally made 5-6 changes to trac and plugins and etc on those boxes...
[13:04:12] <ryanneufeld>  back up... hmm
[13:04:21] <mikesherov> and trac was modded heavily at the summit by those two guys.
[13:04:22] <ryanneufeld> gnarf would have to answer that one
[13:04:29] <mikesherov> I'm nervous about those boxes
[13:07:21] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure where those changes were made
[13:07:32] <ryanneufeld> gnarf was managing most of that.
[13:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> I think they were made on a new box.
[13:08:23] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm not positive.
[13:09:32] <ryanneufeld> I though the same thing
[13:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Just added the link to the about page on blog.jqueryui.com. Thanks again.
[13:14:36] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: You're very welcome :-) Glad I could help a bit ;-)
[13:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I thought you force pushed interactions back to before your merge?
