[00:16:17] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #721: STILL UNSTABLE in 16 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/721/
[03:59:45] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Ping! I rebased page and popup on top of your widget extensions, and they're both green (well, aside from cgack's range slider stuff). So, I think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8141 is good to go.
[04:00:27] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Though on travis there's still https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/66439909#L375
[04:01:02] <gabrielschulhof> ... which seems to be intermittent, because I may have seen it locally too, but not during the last two runs.
[05:14:56] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i need to push an update
[05:15:04] <arschmitz> that is fixed that was the one test i was figuring out
[05:15:08] <arschmitz> it was a dependency issue
[05:16:09] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: actualy i did last night
[05:16:15] <arschmitz> your just looking at an old build https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/66471994
[07:56:39] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I was looking at the build linked from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8141
[07:56:45] <gabrielschulhof> That one's red.
[07:57:27] <gabrielschulhof> Oh - that's actually the same build as the one you linked.
[07:57:42] <gabrielschulhof> I don't get it - is there a new build that's green?
[09:22:02] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: difference between red and the test you linked failing
[09:22:24] <arschmitz> the test you linked is passing on newer builds but of course the rangeslider stuff is still failing
[13:03:08] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8141/ is good to go ... LGTM, and then I can update popup and page and move on to slider ...
