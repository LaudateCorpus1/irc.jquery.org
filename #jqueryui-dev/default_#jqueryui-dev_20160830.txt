[15:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov_: ping
[16:06:38] <mikesherov_> Hi scott_gonzalez
[16:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[16:06:52] <mikesherov_> Long time no speak
[16:06:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, how have you been?
[16:07:06] <mikesherov_> Super busy as usual.
[16:07:16] <mikesherov_> Otherwise, doing well. You?
[16:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> Same :-)
[16:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to track down these failures: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1633373
[16:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking it's related to the switch to rAF.
[16:09:21] <scott_gonzalez> But looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/effects/core.js#L340-L345, I don't even understand why that assertion should pass.
[16:09:39] <scott_gonzalez> How does the animation start before that assertion?
[16:11:44] <mikesherov_> Looking.
[16:12:20] <mikesherov_> Feels too tied to the old order of setTimeout
[16:12:53] <mikesherov_> Like, feels like it relied on implementation details of how many ticks queueing deals with. No?
[16:13:03] <mikesherov_> Haven't looked at tests in a while...
[16:17:01] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: ^
[16:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see how this is supposed to work now.
[16:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> The queued function is just running a setTimeout.
[16:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> So maybe we just need to adjust the durations and run the timeout halfway through.
[16:19:20] <scott_gonzalez> It'll make the tests take longer, but should be a quick fix.
[16:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> We can refactor into rAF later.
[16:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so that worked.
[16:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> I bumped up the minDuration to 60 and made the setTimeout in `duringTest()` use `minDuration / 2`
[16:23:32] <scott_gonzalez> That should ensure that we hit at least one tick and that the animation is still running when the assertion runs.

[16:36:56] <mikesherov_> Yeah, scott_gonzalez root cause is likely microtask/macrotask cross browser differences.
