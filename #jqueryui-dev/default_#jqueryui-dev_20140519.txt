[03:33:52] <alaing> I 'm trying to work out the differences between _on and .on
[04:26:19] <alaing> Hi, I was at the jquery UI foundations workshop in Oxford on Thursday and one person raised a valid point which I hope someone maybe able to answer. How come when you download jQuery UI you get the full version of jQuery but not the minified version as well?

[07:11:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[07:11:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^
[07:11:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[07:11:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[07:12:20] <_|Nix|_> I've asked frequent in email about table extension points and he told me that the hardest thing he had to do with the table was to cause something else to show the columntoggle menu than the default button we generate.
[07:12:52] <_|Nix|_> That's easy now that the button gets an ID, but I was thinking that it might be worth splitting the button/popup/controlgroup/checkboxradio code into a module of its own.
[07:13:03] <_|Nix|_> columntoggle pulls waaay too much right now.
[07:13:11] <_|Nix|_> I mean, it pulls navigation via popup.
[07:14:01] <_|Nix|_> We should break it down into three parts: The basic columntoggle adds the priority classes that cause responsive behaviour. A subclass of that creates the popup. A subclass of the popup-creator adds the button.
[07:14:48] <_|Nix|_> That way, and with a few strategecally placed extension points, it will be possible to provide an alternative UI for allowing the user to manually turn columns on/off.
[07:15:12] <_|Nix|_> ... and people can d/l a lighter package if they just want basic columntoggle functionality.
[07:15:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think?
[07:16:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree that it depends on too many other widgets
[07:16:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not only does it depend on too many other widgets, but it also creates a whole pile of widgets during _create()
[07:17:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, kinda heavy
[07:17:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Come to think of it, we should probably be placing the controlgroups into a form, and preventDefault on submit for that form.
[07:17:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but that's another story.
[07:18:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am thinking about what would be the best way to break it down
[07:18:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think the top-level columntoggle should definitely not create any new widgets.
[07:19:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It should simply implement the concept of translating data-priority="x" to class="ui-table-priority-x"
[07:19:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and that's it. I suppose it could also provide the classes "ui-table-cell-hidden" and "ui-table-cell-visible" for API completeness.
[07:19:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but the widget (extension) is about being able to toggle
[07:20:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not necessarily.
[07:20:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You could argue that the extension is about the ability to hide single columns in priority order.
[07:20:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The ability to then override the dev's priority choices is additional behaviour to that.
[07:21:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and besides, if you pick the whole columntoggle shebang, you get exactly the old behaviour.
[07:23:24] <_|Nix|_> In this sense, columntoggle is gentler than reflow, because columntoggle is gradual, whereas reflow has only one breakpoint. OTOH, because columntoggle actually renders information inaccessible, it definitely needs a UI. That UI, however, need not be hardcoded into the extension.
[07:23:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I understand we will keep providing the old behaviour, but also have to think about if we need to deprecate first before we make a change like this
[07:24:07] <uGoMobi> because you won't have it anymore by default
[07:24:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you mean you won't? Of course you will! If you include the extension, it will create everything. You're not setting an option value from true to false. It will be there.
[07:25:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The only additional thing will be that you'll be able to cut out the code that creates the popup and the button.
[07:25:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's what I meant... "if you include the extension"
[07:26:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is the list of checkboxes in the download builder part of the API?
[07:26:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do we guarantee that, if, in the next version, you click the same checkboxes, you'll get the exact same parts of the library?
[07:27:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I would say no, so that means we wouldn't have to deprecate
[07:27:58] <_|Nix|_> Excellent!
[07:28:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: didn't say we have to deprecate, just that it is something to think of before making changes
[07:28:26] <_|Nix|_> OK. I see.
[07:29:25] <_|Nix|_> We could document in the special comments that people should also grab the popup and button extension if they want the default UI.
[07:31:31] <_|Nix|_> Like: "Be sure to also grab the 'Column toggle popup' and 'Column toggle popup launcher' extensions if you wish to include the default column selection UI"
[07:39:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the DB should handle that
[07:40:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sorry, I misread
[07:40:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: anyway, that would be something for the upgrade guide
[07:51:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: What is the benefit of breaking it up in 3 parts, with two extensions (popup and popup launcher)? When would you only use 1 of the 2 extensions?

[09:44:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you don't need the button, you can launch the popup yourself.
[09:44:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Hi there!
[09:44:29] <rxaviers> I've just landed 207
[09:44:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That was actually frequent's original problem - suppressing the columntoggle-generated button.
[09:44:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No point shoving a button into the DOM if you're just gonna hide it.
[09:45:04] <rxaviers> shall we tag UI beta.2 to test DB on stage?
[09:45:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, the button would be pulling in init, whereas popup wouldn't be.
[09:46:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good point about the upgrade guide.

[11:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> I squashed all the selectmenu commits.
[11:50:51] <scott_gonzalez> And I reworded the double reverts so that the components are correct.
[11:51:27] <tj_vantoll1> Ah ok.
[12:33:13] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I think I have spotted a tiny bug with the jQuery ui site: http://jqueryui.com/download/ and http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ both have a css overriding rule for .clearfix:after which leads to having a small white space right at the bottom of the page. This class is added to the footer. The other pages do not have this.
[12:33:46] <agcolom> I'm not sure whether this is intentional and if it isn't, I'm not sure where to report it
