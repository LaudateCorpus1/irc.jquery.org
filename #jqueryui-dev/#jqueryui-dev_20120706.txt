[05:54:08] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Resizable: corrected type of ui.originalPosition property in start, resize, and stop events. Fixes #19 - Richard D. Worth

[08:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> Will individual effects have their own pages?
[08:17:50] <rworth> I think they should, yeah
[08:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> I assume they'll be named like the docs pages?
[08:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> {name}-effect
[08:18:47] <rworth> yeah
[08:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll update those two URLs.
[08:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> What should we list as the URL for ui.core docs?
[08:19:37] <scott_gonzalez> I figure homepage will just be jqueryui.com
[08:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> Will we have a category page for plugins that come from core?
[08:20:59] <rworth> I guess we should have a 'UI Core' category, yeah
[08:21:27] <scott_gonzalez> So that would be api.jqueryui.com/category/ui-core?
[08:21:43] <rworth> looks good
[08:21:50] <scott_gonzalez> Same for effects core?
[08:22:01] <rworth> yeah
[08:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> And what about jqueryui.com URL for effects core?
[08:22:41] <scott_gonzalez>  /effect /effects /effects-core /core-effect
[08:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG options
[08:23:41] * rworth goes to lunch :)

[13:04:04] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ajpiano you two still chattin?
[13:04:17] <scott_gonzalez> No, I got tired of his voice and hung up.
[13:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> Seriously though, we finished a few minutes ago.
[13:04:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I know you said you were ready to go over the process for the plugins site yesterday
[13:04:54] <ajpiano> i just was onboarding a new contrib
[13:04:56] <ajpiano> <3
[13:05:09] <gnarf> I'm also curious if you can tell me where we are at with jqueryui.com or should I bug rworth?
[13:05:11] <ajpiano> gonna help with html and css
[13:05:34] <gnarf> ajpiano: onboarding --- see ?ts
[13:05:34] <bot-t> ajpiano, That's Sexual™
[13:05:46] <ajpiano> rworth: scott_gonzalez just that the idea that maybe once we have more of the sites staged
[13:05:53] <ajpiano> we might want to make a db dump of test data available
[13:06:08] <ajpiano> so people don't have to go through the invididual stesp of populating plugins, learn, blogs, etc.
[13:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Sounds reasonable.
[13:07:06] <gnarf> ajpiano: well - everything BUT plugins will be populated once you grunt deploy it
[13:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Not sure of jqueryui.com, rworth?
[13:07:15] <ajpiano> cool, filing issues
[13:07:25] <ajpiano> gnarf: not on someone's local machine
[13:07:37] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: grunt deploy to local will work
[13:07:39] <gnarf> ajpiano: I'd like to make a virtualbox VM that has the basic setup
[13:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> That's how it's designed.
[13:07:43] <gnarf> what scott_gonzalez said
[13:07:54] <gnarf> like if you are working on learn, u just grunt deploy it to your local
[13:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> But the plugins site is a bit tricky.
[13:07:56] <gnarf> and you have the whole db
[13:07:57] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: right but i don't want them to have to grunt deploy the site at all
[13:08:08] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: those same trickinesses apply to learn right now as well
[13:08:23] <scott_gonzalez> Right, if they're just working on HTML/CSS, having a db dump is quick.
[13:08:28] <ajpiano> needing to get more environmental stuff setup... if having a db dump is easy, it's mad quick
[13:08:29] <ajpiano> exactly
[13:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> No potential issues with deps, no slow deploys, etc.
[13:08:58] <gnarf> downside - it carries our admin password/users
[13:09:16] <gnarf> although I'm sure nacin could work with me on getting a mysqldump script that leaves these out
[13:09:56] <gnarf> rworth: ping
[13:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I've got some time now if you want to go over the plugins site.
[13:11:02] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sure - skype?
[13:11:08] <gnarf> also btw

[13:11:17] <gnarf> i dunno if that link will work for you
[13:11:18] <gnarf> but
[13:11:42] <gnarf> goto content -> drilldown on analytics
[13:11:46] <gnarf> its a pretty useful thing
[13:11:47] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/32273P3P1Y2e1u131c0p
[13:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that link works for me.
[13:12:08] <rworth> scott_gonzalez here now
[13:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> 1.2mm per day...
[13:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com is 3x more popular than jquery.com :-P
[13:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> I realize that's cheating since jqueryui.com is EVERYTHING
[13:14:03] <rworth> yeah, jquery.com has all of 1 page
[13:14:08] <rworth> er, did
[13:14:12] <rworth> it now has all of 3 pages
[13:17:47] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez, rworth, hi, I think this page also needs the new copyright: http://irc.jquery.com/
[13:18:29] <ajpiano> lol the most amazing thing about that agcolom is that that page was first created in 2011
[13:19:10] <rworth> haha
[13:19:14] <agcolom> :-)
[13:21:20] <nacin> rworth: commented
[13:23:59] <agcolom> one more: http://meetups.jquery.com/
[13:24:22] <rworth> nacin I had a different issue today where I would visit like stage.jqueryui.com/resizable and it was 404 until I visited the permalinks page in wp-admin, then the page showed up
[13:24:27] <rworth> happened in dev. and stage.
[13:24:30] <rworth> ring any bells?
[13:24:40] <nacin> yeah, scott_gonzalez and I talked about some of this
[13:24:44] <nacin> need to look into it a bit more
[13:24:46] <rworth> sorry, that would be stage.api.jqueryui.com/resizable
[13:24:53] <rworth> ok
[13:25:03] <rworth> is there an issue for this one already?
[13:25:11] <nacin> don't think so
[13:25:45] <agcolom> and there all the ones in meetup (from the links at the bottom of the page)
[13:26:41] <FJ> what ip is it again?
[13:29:16] <ajpiano> FJ, for stage?
[13:31:26] <FJ> yes

[14:47:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: random idea
[14:47:44] <gnarf> since manager.js is unlikely to actually change...
[14:48:22] <gnarf> could we just send it a -HUP signal to have it create new servers on same ports, and kill old ones for the listeners, and then stop/start the other two daemons?
[15:32:57] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez timmywil: we've got jquery-git regressions, looks like sizzle updates broke custom selectors - http://swarm.jquery.org/job/185
[15:33:14] <timmywil> working on it
[15:33:36] <timmywil> I don't think it's custom selectors though
[15:34:22] <jzaefferer> timmywil: here it is: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/34740 "Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: ui-testWidget"
[15:36:23] <jzaefferer> ah, I see, news already reached #jquery-dev
[15:37:17] <timmywil> actually, I know what that is
[15:38:00] <timmywil> I'm going to fix it, but I recommend adding custom pseudos all lowercase in the future so Sizzle can always find it. All pseudo-classes are case-insensitive in the spec
[15:38:26] <timmywil> but I'm just going to do fitlers[ regularCase] || filters[ regularcase ]
[15:38:45] <timmywil> so it's not that big of a deal
[15:56:04] <jzaefferer> okay, good to know
