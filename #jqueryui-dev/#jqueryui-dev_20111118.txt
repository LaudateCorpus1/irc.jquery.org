[07:42:33] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: how many branches are gonna blow up when the _super change?
[07:42:55] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: that's what sucks about this change
[07:43:25] <jzaefferer> I'd go through them and merge+update
[07:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, shouldn't be too bad
[07:44:19] <jzaefferer> grid, editable, interactions, selectmenu, mask, datepicker
[07:44:27] <jzaefferer> formcontrols and panel is stale anyway
[07:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> so LivingSocial is using jQuery UI
[07:50:12] <scott_gonzalez> I saw a progressbar after my purchase
[07:50:23] <scott_gonzalez> but it was animated/throbbing
[07:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> and I was trying to figure out what they were doing
[07:50:42] <scott_gonzalez> and then it completed and the progressbar went away :-(
[08:00:51] <michelled> hhillen: hi, are you working on the date picker these days?

[08:09:12] <jzaefferer> like a sith m(
[08:09:24] <michelled> scott_gonzalez: thx - and the bugs in Trak refer to this version?
[08:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> the a11y bugs that Everett filed do
[08:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> but none of the others do
[08:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> we don't really use Trac for unreleased code
[08:10:57] <jzaefferer> hey rxaviers, is it okay if I update the editable branch? gonna merge the _super update
[08:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> we just track it on the planning wiki
[08:11:21] <jzaefferer> michelled: for datepicker that is http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Datepicker
[08:11:29] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, please
[08:12:04] <michelled> thx. I don't see a list of TODOs for this one - am I missing something?
[08:16:36] <michelled> jzaefferer: I'm also wondering if anyone else is working on date picker at the moment. Do you know?
[08:16:44] <jzaefferer> michelled: nope, no one
[08:17:24] <michelled> cool, thx
[08:20:31] <jzaefferer> so if you're interested working on that, we should do a bit of planning
[08:21:06] <hhillen> michelled: I finished accessibility changes to the date picker a while back, so for now I'm done with it.  My changes are all checked in.
[08:21:17] <jzaefferer> its currently very minimalistic: I started it back in February to test templating, Hans did some stuff later
[08:21:29] <jzaefferer> and he's here, too \o/

[08:26:35] <michelled> jzaefferer: you look busy with the build and I have a meeting to go to but I would like to work on the date picker
[08:26:58] <jzaefferer> well, build isn't so much the problem
[08:27:05] <jzaefferer> but its getting kinda later here anyway
[08:27:13] <jzaefferer> let's talk about datepicker next week!
[08:27:31] <michelled> jzaefferer: sounds good - do you want to schedule something? or ping me in here when ever
[08:27:56] <jzaefferer> wednesday would be good
[08:28:43] <michelled> ok
[08:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, rworth, kborchers, gnarf: https://gist.github.com/1376993
[08:50:26] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: nice, now add links back to trac :-)
[08:51:11] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: cool
[09:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> links to Trac seems a bit harder
[09:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> starting on it now
[09:08:14] <jzaefferer> just tried it, works great
[09:10:59] <jzaefferer> also update widget factory docs for the _super change
[09:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> working with the DOM sucks
[09:29:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer: how about something like this? https://gist.github.com/1377124
[09:30:19] <kborchers> only pulls ticket num from link ... need to check other paragraphs too
[09:31:26] <scott_gonzalez> I was trying to make a separate script for the Trac tickets, since it's unique to /jquery/jquery-ui/*
[09:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> also want it to work on more than the PR pages
[09:31:40] <scott_gonzalez> like commits
[09:31:54] <kborchers> sure ... if you want to get all fancy :P
[09:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'm also trying to do it inline, which is a bit tougher
[09:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: maybe you can fix my broken script
[09:35:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/8e09b4c16033385ffd54
[09:36:02] <scott_gonzalez> the text replacement doesn't work
[09:36:28] <kborchers> oooo, recursion fun
[09:36:40] <scott_gonzalez> yay, trees
[09:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> there's gotta be an easier way to work on user scripts
[09:52:18] <kborchers> well, this is fun
