[03:21:33] <rxaviers> On https://twitter.com/chipersoft/status/278916980675846145, he wants the download builder not to handle dependencies, is that right?

[05:10:22] <rxaviers> thks
[05:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8914 We shouldn't be handling transparent in cssHooks.
[05:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> We need to special case it in animations, but not in .css().

[06:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Let me know when you're around.
[06:01:16] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: Sorta around
[06:01:35] <scott_gonzalez> It looks to me like grunt 0.4.0 doesn't export a binary.
[06:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> Did you have that problem too?
[06:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see anything in package.json for it.
[06:02:01] <mikesherov> Oh, the cli?
[06:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I'm supposed to install grunt-cli, huh?
[06:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> damnit
[06:02:19] <mikesherov> yeah
[06:02:34] <mikesherov> Grunt will look for local first
[06:02:59] <mikesherov> And if not found, looks for global cli
[06:03:15] <mikesherov> Everything is separate now
[06:03:30] <mikesherov> Grunt-init is its own project even
[06:03:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I read the upgrade guide, I just forgot about that :-/
[06:04:07] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: K
[06:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, now I've got grunt-cli installed, I can continue working on grunt updates.
[06:04:42] <mikesherov> What's the deal with grunt-junit anyway?
[06:04:48] <scott_gonzalez> not sure
[06:04:55] <mikesherov> Cool. Thanks!
[06:04:59] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's a jzaefferer/johnbender thing.
[06:05:14] <mikesherov> K

[14:14:06] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hey Scott, do you have anything in UI that is just a widget extension but not a widget?
[14:18:06] <agcolom> oh, sorry, apparently this is apparently not even a widget extension... please ignore my question :-)
[14:18:35] <agcolom> (unless you know exactly what I'm talking about and you have the perfect answer to my problem ;-) )
[14:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> I know what widget extensions are, but I don't know what specifically you're referring to.
[18:21:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: around?
[18:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[18:24:22] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so i'm not sure where we left things with progressbar a11y. should i be working on the demo(s) that jzaefferer mentioned based on valuetext or can we not go that route either because of voice over?
[18:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> We can't just modify the demos, we need to fix it in the actual widget. But right now, it's not clear what to do.
[18:25:23] <kborchers> i feel stuck because voiceover gets it right and we break it to make the others sort of work
[18:25:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: right, i would have to add the valuetext stuff to progressbar (the fix) to do those demos ‚Ä¶ but that can't be the fix since it break voiceover
[18:28:36] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: well in that case, if we are stuck there, is there anything else you need me working on for 1.10? or should i be moving on to 1.11 or anything else you have on "your list" :)
[18:31:49] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to look through open tickets for newer components?
[18:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> menu, autocomplete, spinner, tabs, accordion
[18:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> core, widget
[18:33:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: will do
[22:38:28] <hypnotoaddd> #jquery
[22:38:35] <hypnotoaddd> oops
[23:56:10] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: it's about the header/content/footer which are part of page.sections but page.sections is not a widget and I'm wondering how to document that... they have options but no event or methods...
[23:56:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: details here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/page.sections.js
[23:57:16] <agcolom> (just in case you have an idea... thank you :-) )
