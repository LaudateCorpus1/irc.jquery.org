[05:04:13] <gnarf> brrr
[05:05:30] <gnarf> i shoulda closed the windows last night
[05:14:17] <jzaefferer> batcave?
[05:15:00] <gnarf> just got cold.... very cold...
[05:15:03] <gnarf> ?weather
[05:15:04] <bot-t> gnarf, Rockford, IL - Time: 7:15am Thursday (CDT), Weather: Sunny, 3°C / 37°F
[05:16:13] <jzaefferer> 3ÂºC? yuck
[05:16:57] <gnarf> its like maybe 18
[05:17:00] <gnarf> in my roo
[05:17:11] <gnarf> m
[05:33:15] <jzaefferer> gnarf: there's a note about spinner and mask down at Open issues: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138077/Spinner
[05:33:18] <jzaefferer> can we remove that?
[05:34:17] <jzaefferer> as for the complete event in Mask, could you ping Josh about it? if he doesn't have a usecase either, remove it
[05:34:31] <gnarf> aye
[05:34:33] <gnarf> to both
[05:34:44] <jzaefferer> nice job on the caret positioning, works great now
[05:34:53] <jzaefferer> okay, I'll edit the spinner page
[05:35:02] <gnarf> reading this spinner types thing
[05:35:04] <gnarf> kinda neat idea
[05:35:12] <gnarf> i might take part of that into the mask
[05:35:25] <gnarf> in the definitions
[05:35:55] <gnarf> i wonder if i could make mask support an "array" of valid values
[05:36:10] <gnarf> ie. { definitions: { tt: ["am","pm"] } }
[05:36:17] <jzaefferer> ah
[05:36:36] <gnarf> that definition makes way more sense than having to write a function for it
[05:36:56] <gnarf> plus then the definitions in the spinner could use it
[05:37:00] <jzaefferer> as for the remaining comment on the Mask page, did you address that?
[05:37:24] <gnarf> mobile?
[05:37:28] <gnarf> oh comments
[05:37:34] <gnarf> the 3(right) works
[05:37:40] <gnarf> it fills in 03
[05:37:56] <jzaefferer> ok, whatever, can we remove the comment?
[05:38:01] <jzaefferer> its old anyway :-)
[05:38:07] <gnarf> ill do that
[05:38:11] <gnarf> im on it right now anyway
[05:38:17] <gnarf> or wait
[05:38:21] <gnarf> can i remove comments?
[05:38:27] <gnarf> i dont see a link to do so
[05:38:30] <jzaefferer> is there a Delete link next to Reply?
[05:38:36] <gnarf> nope
[05:38:47] <jzaefferer> sec
[05:38:59] <jzaefferer> try
[05:39:09] <jzaefferer> again
[05:39:20] <gnarf> yup
[05:39:22] <gnarf> deleted
[05:40:07] <jzaefferer> okay, so figure the complete event, write demos - anything else left in Mask?
[05:40:18] <jzaefferer> should we do a join code review with Scott?
[05:40:55] <gnarf> sure
[05:41:00] <gnarf> mask is kinda dirty
[05:41:15] <jzaefferer> took me a bit to understand the buffer object
[05:41:20] <gnarf> I'm prolly gonna be working on units for timepicker right now
[05:41:23] <jzaefferer> but that's the easy part
[05:41:37] <jzaefferer> okay, let's see when Scott is available
[05:41:39] <gnarf> yeah, once you understand how the buffer works, it gets way easier
[05:41:50] <gnarf> there are some limitations with it that bother me tho
[05:41:57] <jzaefferer> the rolling over is implemented, so we can drop that Open issue + comment?
[05:42:51] <gnarf> 1 sec, finishing a message to josh
[05:42:56] <gnarf> and ill make sure i know what your talking about
[05:42:57] <gnarf> :)
[05:50:06] <gnarf> should i add myself to authors?
[05:51:34] <gnarf> rolling over issue...

[05:52:21] <gnarf> removing
[05:52:42] <gnarf> okay
[05:52:43] <gnarf> so
[05:52:54] <gnarf> I'd like to talk to someone about how to tie in the aria properties on that
[05:52:58] <gnarf> timepicker
[05:53:39] <gnarf> should it say the whole time whenever you change anything or like "hours" when you get to the hours, up/down gives you a number, "minutes" when you highlight minutes etc
[05:53:56] <gnarf> message sent to josh also
[05:55:15] <gnarf> Josh's response: "The completed event was added by request early on.  I added the hooks to trigger change later, and I think that would be plenty."
[05:55:22] <gnarf> so I'm gonna pull it
[05:58:06] <gnarf> hrm
[05:58:25] <gnarf> timepicker thought - should it default to like noon if there is nothing set in the input?
[05:58:50] <gnarf> should we maybe allow a min/max time?
[05:59:07] <gnarf> like "pick a time between 7am and 5pm"
[05:59:23] <gnarf> eh
[05:59:23] <gnarf> no
[05:59:29] <gnarf> that gets wacky quick in my mind
[06:00:13] <jzaefferer> I think we need to figure out the globalize integration first
[06:00:44] <jzaefferer> in my spinner-timepicker demo, you could set a min and max as a timestamp, as that's what it uses as a value internally
[06:01:24] <jzaefferer> being able to take a timestamp (from datepicker?) and set that as the value on timepicker seems useful to me
[06:02:08] <gnarf> what "day" should it use in the Date when generating a value
[06:02:14] <gnarf> or should it just be like ms from 00:00
[06:02:39] <gnarf> cuz i could add a "value" getter/setter to get the "raw value" just not sure what the "raw value" should be yet
[06:03:48] <jzaefferer> raw value == timestamp?
[06:03:59] <jzaefferer> if you don't set anything, start with 01-01-1970 00:00
[06:04:24] <jzaefferer> that is, raw value == 0
[06:04:30] <jzaefferer> or whatever that really is
[06:05:19] <jzaefferer> yeah, raw value == 0 as the default seems fine
[06:05:47] <jzaefferer> or not, as it won't be 00:00 for any non GMT-timezone...
[06:07:34] <gnarf> right
[06:07:47] <gnarf> thats where i got stuck trying to think of what the "raw value" should be

[13:09:24] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: we need to update tooltip to GTFO when its element is removed
[13:10:22] <jzaefferer> can we just do _bind({ remove: function() { this.destroy() })?
[13:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:10:42] <jzaefferer> shouldn't that be happening already?
[13:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> which element is being removed?
[13:11:08] <scott_gonzalez> the element you initialized on?
[13:11:09] <jzaefferer> the tooltipped
[13:11:13] <jzaefferer> yeah
[13:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> reduced test case or it doesn't exist
[13:11:56] <jzaefferer> not reduced, but to demonstrate: http://view.jqueryui.com/grid/grid-editing/grid.html
[13:12:02] <jzaefferer> click Edit on the first row
[13:12:07] <jzaefferer> hit enter
[13:12:17] <jzaefferer> "firstname" tooltip stays
[13:12:49] <jzaefferer> ah, I guess its just hiding the form, therefore no remove event is triggered
[13:13:06] <jzaefferer> had another case where something got replaced...
[13:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> well, not much to do if the element is hidden
[13:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> actually, that seems like a bug
[13:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> why is there no blur event?
[13:15:25] <jzaefferer> yeah, and if I try to call .tooltip("close") on the form, nothing happens either
[13:15:45] <jzaefferer> shouldn't have to pass an event.currentTarget for that to work
[13:16:03] <jzaefferer> we keep track of open tooltips anyway
[13:20:12] <jzaefferer> btw. scott_gonzalez, on that demo, double click in the Bitcoins column
[13:20:19] <jzaefferer> IE6 patch side effects!
[13:20:41] <jzaefferer> spinner is initialized while hidden, getting a height of 0px assigned (my wild guess)
