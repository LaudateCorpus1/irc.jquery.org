[00:00:41] <predat0r> hi
[00:03:51] <predat0r> somebody know how to (if its possible) to store ui calendar state in cookie? i mean if i page down some months, after page refresh (php) the cal month remains the same
[00:24:51] <ThiefMaster|work> why not use ajax instead of full page reloads?
[00:27:22] <predat0r> its a requirement form client , very thin js jq in code..
[00:27:54] <predat0r> ppl wo js could watch the page
[00:30:58] <predat0r> in theory is it possible ?
[00:31:15] <ThiefMaster|work> you realize the ui calendar also breaks without javascript?
[00:31:32] <ThiefMaster|work> and yes you could just save the date in a cookie and use it as the default date
[00:31:47] <gnarf> #jquery please
[00:31:47] <predat0r> yes
[00:32:30] <predat0r> i meant lot of ajax on the site. of course calendar require js.
[00:32:48] <gnarf> this channel is for discussion of developing jquery-ui itself, support questions in #jquery please - thx
[00:33:01] <predat0r> ok
[00:33:27] <predat0r> ThiefMaster|work answer is enough for me to do a callback. thx
[00:35:42] <predat0r> bye
[06:09:50] <kborchers> ajpiano: you around?
[06:14:08] <kborchers> gnarf: hey
[06:18:32] <ajpiano> kborchers: sup, just walked in
[06:19:04] <kborchers> so there is a troll in #jquery and i was thinking about giving him the boot but then couldn't op myself
[06:19:33] <kborchers> maybe doing something wrong but it says i am not an op in that channel
[06:19:35] <ajpiano> kborchers: which one?
[06:19:48] <kborchers> detailiffanu
[06:19:48] <ajpiano> (is the troll)
[06:20:06] <kborchers> just annoying and giving stupid answers that are not relevant and copying what others say
[06:20:23] <kborchers> it's not constant but enought to be annoying
[06:20:50] <kborchers> others are telling him to shut up
[06:20:52] <ajpiano> hmm weird
[06:20:56] <ajpiano> you're def in the ops list
[06:21:02] <ajpiano> when you do /cs op #jquery wat happens
[06:21:46] <kborchers> unknown command
[06:21:56] <ajpiano> what about /msg chanserv op #jquery
[06:22:03] <ajpiano> i'm reading back
[06:22:19] <kborchers> that worked
[06:22:41] <kborchers> (8:09:42 AM) detailiffanu: BrokenCog: RoR is deprecated
[06:22:52] <ajpiano> yeah i got back to like 2 hours ago already
[06:23:47] <ajpiano> he accuses a lot of ppl of trolling wow
[06:23:53] <kborchers> right
[06:24:25] <kborchers> seems to have stopped for now but at least now i can do something about it
[06:24:29] <ajpiano> heh
[06:24:33] <ajpiano> OR I CAN AHHHHHH
[06:24:44] <kborchers> :)
[06:26:42] <kborchers> there, back into stealth troll tracking mode ;)
[06:27:57] <kborchers> thanks ajpiano. i really needed it the other day when someone started flooding the channel but coldhead jumped in so it was all good
[06:28:17] <ajpiano> phew
[06:28:21] <ajpiano> well now you know what to do!
[07:15:44] <timmywil> jzaefferer: I think your stop needs less semaphores http://bassistance.de/i/d9524d.png
[07:15:58] <timmywil> ;)
[07:23:39] <jzaefferer> haha
[07:23:44] <jzaefferer> I didn't even write that code :p
[07:50:03] <gnarf> kborchers: sup
[07:50:55] <kborchers> i couldn't figure out how to +o myself in #jquery so was going to ask you to ban a guy but adam helped me out ... and he's gone ;)
[07:52:07] <kborchers> gnarf: so what's the deal with FF and bottom right? :/
[07:52:35] <gnarf> kborchers: so like - i was trying to "detect" if the element was positioned top/left or bottom/right
[07:52:56] <gnarf> for all effects except scale, we pretty much leave things wherever they were right...
[07:52:58] <gnarf> but with scale
[07:53:03] <gnarf> if it ends up a different size
[07:53:07] <gnarf> we need to reposition
[07:53:10] <kborchers> right
[07:53:45] <kborchers> so FF won't tell you if right or bottom are set?
[07:53:58] <gnarf> problem: FF has no way to determine if top/left or bottom/right are being used for positioning, short of some stupid calculations
[07:54:38] <gnarf> hence my idea here: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/commit/f0c45f6fd04b7775d45b06756229b48172723288
[07:54:39] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by gnarf37 (17h, 48m ago): Scale: We can't detect this reliably currently, so assume all elements are positioned with left and top
[07:54:54] <kborchers> yeah, i'm looking at that now
[07:54:55] <gnarf> remove a bunch of code thats trying to fix something
[07:55:18] <gnarf> and just assume all elements passed to scale in this fashion are positioned with top/left
[07:56:41] <kborchers> so if they are bottom right, what will happen? scale then jump back down to bottom right after?
[07:58:29] <gnarf> no, they will be left in their "new" top/left position
[08:01:39] <kborchers> hmmm, so what happens now? is it worse?
[08:05:48] <gnarf> right now, in all browsers cept FF it does what you'd expect
[08:06:01] <gnarf> in FF it positions everything right/bottom
[08:06:28] <kborchers> oh, even if it's not? that's not good
[08:06:46] <gnarf> i'd rather consistently position everything top/left than have a bug in FF that makes everything bottom/right
[08:06:56] <kborchers> i agree
[08:07:29] <kborchers> you can always reposition bottom right after the scale ... it will jump but at least be consistent
[08:08:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez wants the scale effect to diaf I think
[08:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> I do
[08:08:52] <gnarf> so he prolly doesn't care about this topic
[08:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> this topic I actually do care about
[08:09:50] <gnarf> cool, care to weigh in?
[08:09:55] <scott_gonzalez> but as you've said, I don't think we can handle top/left/bottom/right properly
[08:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> I hate that you can't use bottom or right on anything in jQuery UI
[08:10:26] <gnarf> until we can - can i just assume top/left, or should I (lol) add an option?
[08:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> actually, an option may not be the worst thing in this case
[08:11:11] <scott_gonzalez> since it's impossible for us to do on our own and you can't write an extension that would fix it
[08:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> but for now I'm fine with just always using top/left
[08:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> we can look at this again when we get into the interaction rewrites
[08:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> since those have the same problem
[08:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> like a bottom positioned draggable
[08:14:42] <gnarf> okay
[08:14:48] <gnarf> i'll cherry-pick this commit over
[08:15:05] <gnarf> and open a bug about bottom/right position
[08:19:27] <Rushing> there's some wonkiness in the jquery widget factory events (imo). maybe someone in here can shed some light
[08:19:35] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/ZhWBHQ
[08:19:35] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Dialog: fix small memory leak when having lot's of instances. Fixes #7793 - Small memory leak in ui dialog. - Florian Gutmann
[08:20:09] <Rushing> option callbacks get different arguments than the event handlers. i.e. callbacks(evt, [args]) ... and ... handler(evt, arg1, arg2, arg3)
[08:20:24] <Rushing> i think the handler args is what's expected, but seems like they should at least be the same
[08:20:38] <Rushing> this is using _trigger, btw

[08:20:58] <bot-t> (13 hours 50 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell jq-jenkins WHAT IS JQ JENKINS?
[08:22:10] <Rushing> also, it doesn't seem like there's a way to get any data from an event. _trigger just returns whether the callback/handler canceled the event or returned false, and if you pass _trigger the event (param 2), then it creates a new copy of the event before dispatching, so the event that you passed is unchanged

[08:26:11] <jzaefferer> hey gnarf: http://jsdo.it/ksk1015/cLLl
[08:26:16] <Rushing> i think line 257 of jquery.ui.widget.js should be something like callback.apply($.isArray(data) ? [].push.apply([event], data) : data)
[08:26:26] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah, i saw that - pretty hot :)
[08:26:57] <gnarf> [].push.apply ?
[08:26:58] <gnarf> huh?
[08:27:00] <gnarf> why not
[08:27:05] <gnarf> [event].concat( data )
[08:27:37] <Rushing> err yeah, you're right, i was thinking they need to be combined
[08:27:55] <Rushing> wait no, that's right
[08:28:05] <gnarf> that will "expand" the array tho
[08:28:12] <Rushing> that would give the callback the events the way that the handler gets them
[08:28:21] <Rushing> right, that's correct for the callback
[08:29:41] <Rushing> actually it should be callback.apply(this.element[0], ...)
[08:30:18] <Rushing> callback.apply(this.element[0], $.isArray(data) ? [].push.apply([event], data) : [event, data])
[08:30:23] <Rushing> there.
[08:33:01] <gnarf> Rushing: which version of widget are you talking about btw?
[08:33:12] <Rushing> 1.8.14
[08:33:17] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L257
[08:33:33] <gnarf> Rushing: no sense in talking about the past, can you try to find the appropriate thing in master?
[08:33:42] <Rushing> ah, it's fixed there
[08:34:17] <gnarf> okay is it fixed in the 1-8-stable branch?
[08:34:43] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-8-stable/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L257
[08:35:21] <Rushing> no
[08:35:58] <gnarf> file a ticket / create a pull request against 1-8-stable ?
[08:41:14] <scott_gonzalez> don't file a ticket
[08:41:38] <scott_gonzalez> there's already a ticket, which is closed as fixed for 1.9
[08:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> btw, this is an enhancement, not a bug fix
[08:42:00] <Rushing> ok cool, thanks
[08:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> widgets were never intended to be passed any data other than a single hash
[08:42:25] <Rushing> sitting here tryinx to figure out how to create a pull request fo the file :x ...new to git...
[08:42:44] <Rushing> scott_gonzalez, right, i'm talking about the callbacks though
[08:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> it wasn't designed to allow you to pass an arrya
[08:43:21] <scott_gonzalez> it's as designed
[08:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> all events and callbacks are (event, ui)
[08:44:06] <Rushing> well, _trigger is designed to dispatch an event with data in it, and $.Event converts an array if you pass it as the data
[08:44:28] <Rushing> so they should at least be consistent, and it in the version gnarf pointed me to, it will work as expected
[08:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> yes, I changed it for 1.9
[08:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> what I'm saying is that it was not meant to match $.Event
[08:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> you're using widget events in a way that was not intended
[08:45:19] <Rushing> i would say that the callback is "designed" to act like the first event handler, so it should be supplied arguments the same way the handler is
[08:45:37] <gnarf> { myArray: array } as your data solves the problem too
[08:45:38] <gnarf> right?
[08:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> yes, the callback should act like the events, but you should not pass an array to the events
[08:46:06] <Rushing> gnarf, no
[08:46:29] <Rushing> scott_gonzalez, taht doesn't make sense to me. why?
[08:46:39] <scott_gonzalez> because all events are (event, ui)
[08:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> not (event, whatever, the, dev, decided, to, pass)
[08:47:01] <gnarf> right, hence my suggestion to pass a "ui" object that has a reference to the array
[08:47:01] <Rushing> it should just act like a normal event. if you want it to be an array of args or a hash, let it be either. it's an event
[08:47:19] <scott_gonzalez> you're breaking consistency
[08:47:44] <Rushing> you mean allowing flexibility? :P the UI can hold to that pattern, but i don't see why it should be inforced on all widget events
[08:47:53] <Rushing> enforced*
[08:48:00] <gnarf> Rushing: scott_gonzalez has a point there, the only use of the triggered events has you passing hashes around
[08:48:18] <gnarf> at least, everything in UI follows that pattern
[08:48:25] <gnarf> it would make sense to continue following that pattern
[08:48:28] <scott_gonzalez> there are good reasons to disallow flexibility
[08:48:39] <Rushing> what's the point of $.Event converting an array argument at all then?
[08:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> a framework that allows everything is bad
[08:49:03] <scott_gonzalez> the $.Event API is bad
[08:49:13] <Rushing> :o ooo no you di'int
[08:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> it's horrible to support .call() and .apply() syntaxes, since you can't actually support both
[08:50:20] <Rushing> well, it's good to know this is the standard. i will keep it in mind, but personally i don't like having to hash all of my event arguments. i think it should be a choice
[08:50:57] <Rushing> i think it's a pretty minor difference, and the way to go would be to make all event data parameters require an array
[08:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> that choice breaks consistency for almost no benefit
[08:51:09] <Rushing> so you don't have to support call and apply
[08:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> that's out of our hands
[08:52:19] <Rushing> yeah, that's fine. i just think it's a pretty standard pattern to have callbacks supplied arguments, not just one hash
[08:52:28] <Rushing> UI or not
[08:52:43] <scott_gonzalez> it's also a pretty standard pattern to design shitty APIs
[08:53:10] <scott_gonzalez> sorry, that's going to derail this conversation
[08:53:24] <Rushing> lol not sure that's a valid point :P ...why not make _all_ functions accept only hashes if that is so superior?
[08:53:29] <scott_gonzalez> one of the main purposes of the widget factory is to enforce a standard API
[08:54:28] <scott_gonzalez> you can easily learn any widget's API by discovery
[08:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> having a single hash aids in that discovery
[08:54:39] <Rushing> fair enough
[08:54:47] <scott_gonzalez> having multiple parameters does not
[08:55:35] <Rushing> well console.log(arguments) usually gets me what i need, but i can see what you mean. i think both has benefits, and i just lean towards arguments
[08:55:53] <Rushing> seems more consistent with other callbacks i create/use
[08:56:07] <Rushing> $.ajax, for instance
[08:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> console.log( arguments ) is inherently less informative than console.log( ui )
[08:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> because you have no names
[08:56:27] <Rushing> agreed, that's why i said "usually"
[08:57:32] <Rushing> it could also be said that an obscure set of arguments can be passed to another method as arguments, more easily than a hash
[08:58:13] <Rushing> anywho, i think we're beating a dead horse. i said my piece, and i understand why it was the way it was
[08:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> that's actually not true
[08:59:03] <Rushing> sure it is. you might be able to do method.apply(obj, [hash.something, hash.something2, hash.something3]), but what if you don't know what the "somethings" are in the hash?
[08:59:05] <Rushing> sol
[08:59:21] <Rushing> or you have to do something like $.map(hash, function(){...});
[08:59:46] <Rushing> actually i don't know if map works on a hash like $.each
[08:59:52] <gnarf> Rushing: it does
[08:59:58] <gnarf> in 1.6+
[09:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> you're assuming that you magically have two functions that take the same parameters and you have no idea what they are
[09:00:26] <scott_gonzalez> I think the developer is SOL in that case
[09:00:31] <scott_gonzalez> for not knowing what the hell he is doing
[09:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> this conversation has severely degraded
[09:01:21] <Rushing> i'm saying that the second method might do some auto discovery and the first method just acts as a proxy
[09:01:51] <scott_gonzalez> that autodiscovery sounds incredibly fragile
[09:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> also, you can autodiscover on an object
[09:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> it's actually probably easier to autodiscover on an object
[09:02:26] <Rushing> you're right. you win
[09:03:17] <Rushing> ah, sorry i was just converting my widget and noticed this lol...
[09:03:44] <Rushing> i have a reset method that uses a _reset option or the prototype _reset method
[09:04:20] <Rushing> so it doesn't really know what either will return, but i want that to be up to the developer, since all i'm doing is passing it to the event
[09:05:14] <Rushing> nevermind. i'm done lol. just realized my answer
[09:43:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: draggable review?
[09:44:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: 15 minutes? i was just about to go get some stuff at the store so i can make a quick sandwhich
[09:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:44:36] <gnarf> cool, bbiab
[09:52:44] <chrisj_> I'm not finding much help in the #jquery channel... could someone quickly tell me in what order I need to include the bgiframe plug-in along with jquery ui 1.8.14 in order for it to effectively block text boxes and selects when opening a modal dialog??
[09:54:46] <kborchers> chrisj_: that is why i asked you for a demo ... if you can't get it to break in jsfiddle then there is something else wrong with your code. do you have some crazy z-index set on your form elements? anyway, please keep support questions in #jquery
[09:56:54] <chrisj_> jsFiddle doesn't even require that I include bgiframe...
[09:57:14] <chrisj_> it blocks the elements no matter what...
[09:57:25] <chrisj_> which made me suspect of jsFiddle...
[09:58:15] <chrisj_> I'll though.
[11:14:14] <gnarf> kborchers: we might of come up with a legit use of .box
[11:14:36] <gnarf> elem.box() === { left: , top:, width:, height: }
[11:14:55] <kborchers> just saw scott's tweet
[11:15:37] <kborchers> ok, but does it do all magic?
[11:16:20] <gnarf> it could also be a setter
[11:16:31] <gnarf> *protip*
[11:16:35] <gnarf> thats pretty magical
[11:16:41] <gnarf> but i don't think it does all magic yet
[11:17:15] <kborchers> is this from your draggable discussion?
[11:17:23] <gnarf> yeah
[11:19:19] <kborchers> so are you thinking it's just sort of a position(), height() and width() all in one type of thing for both getting and setting? that would be kind of "magical"
[11:30:19] <gnarf> kborchers: yup
[11:30:24] <gnarf> kborchers: thats excatly what i'm thinking
[11:30:57] <gnarf> kborchers: its also totally related to "dnd"
[11:31:11] <kborchers> haha
[11:31:27] <kborchers> and what's even better is that is a perfect name for it
[11:46:21] <gnarf> right?
[11:59:38] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: accepted your cleanup - and now i know how i should be handling those members. would hav never guessed commenting members liek that :) and i realize i forgot to alphabetize
[12:04:03] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: got a few minutes for a Skype call?
[12:04:36] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: not at work. i can at home tonight ( im being a bum tonight with gf at apt )
[12:04:54] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: scott_gonzalez just sent you another pull
[12:05:01] <gnarf> and scott_gonzalez http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7795
[12:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> ok, tonight doesn't work for me
[12:05:11] <scott_gonzalez> but we'll find some time
[12:05:18] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[12:05:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'm always afk when you're around
[12:05:22] <Dave_Stein> glad conference is done with
[12:05:28] <Dave_Stein> ha
[12:07:23] <Dave_Stein> effing github
[12:07:37] <Dave_Stein> i was browsing your diff to see ._bind and then it had no way for me to merge and then said pull requests 0
[12:07:38] <Dave_Stein> got it now
[12:08:13] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: i am about to go coffee break, i can do a quick phone chat there if you'd want.
[12:08:26] <Dave_Stein> don't worry i'd never call you randomly with a jquery question lol
[12:09:16] <scott_gonzalez> heh, was gonna do a skype call with you and gnarf
[12:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf did the review with me just now
[12:09:34] <Dave_Stein> ahhh
[12:09:42] <Dave_Stein> i can do a 3 way
[12:09:44] <scott_gonzalez> he's about to leave in a few min anyway
[12:09:47] <Dave_Stein> 3 way phone convference
[12:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> ?twss
[12:09:48] <bot-t1> <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[12:09:49] <Dave_Stein> hah
[12:10:04] <gnarf> wow
[12:10:12] <Dave_Stein> whats that?
