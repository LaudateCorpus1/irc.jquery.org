[07:20:47] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: what you you think of switching from concat to require.js for creating /dist since thats what DB uses anyway it would be a better tests thats what we do in mobile and it has the bonus of detecting and failing on dependency issues

[08:10:03] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Why doesn't UI use DB to create dist/? Isn't that the plan for mobile? Creating jquery.ui-version.js should be a special case of using DB to create a Christmas tree custom build (i.e., all checkboxes are checked).
[08:10:23] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: ui dist is just for testing
[08:10:28] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, OK.
[08:10:30] <arschmitz> its not used any where
[08:10:43] <gabrielschulhof> So how is the file produced that ends up on the CDN?
[08:10:49] <arschmitz> DB
[08:10:58] <arschmitz>  im pretty sure anyway
[08:10:59] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, OK, so it's there already. Excellent!
[08:11:26] <gabrielschulhof> Or, rather, pretty-sure-excellent :)
[08:17:35] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: seems a good change to me

[08:32:58] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I've pushed your amd-demos branch to origin to test it within jqueryui.com + download.jqueryui.com
[08:33:14] <arschmitz> ok
[08:34:31] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i currently have the tests running in a loop on all the commits of the core break up
[08:34:55] <arschmitz> making sure they pass on each commit so al the dependency changes are proper
[08:35:08] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:35:35] <jzaefferer> we need to land amd-demos, then rebase core-splitup and update/test demos there, then do the same test again that I'm currently doing
[08:35:36] <arschmitz> its a lot of small dependency changes that need to be done in the right order with the core breakup combined with the folder re-org
[08:35:56] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: they can land in either order 
[08:36:04] <arschmitz> the core breakup includes updating the demos
[08:36:17] <jzaefferer> Right, but you don't want to do that before the amd-demos changes
[08:36:23] <arschmitz> so if you want to only test once we can land the core break up first
[08:36:33] <jzaefferer> I don't think that's feasible
[08:36:43] <jzaefferer> I've got it deploying right now, so I'm hopeful
[08:36:47] <arschmitz> ok
[08:37:34] <arschmitz> jzaefferer:  just FTI i wrote them to be completely atomic changes so the PR's dont really effect eachother regardless of the order they land in
[08:37:57] <jzaefferer> did you make the demo changes already?
[08:38:15] <arschmitz> which demo changes
[08:38:26] <jzaefferer> I'm wondering about the new dependencies that you'd have to all add if you update demos before amd changes land
[08:38:37] <arschmitz> thats already done
[08:38:47] <jzaefferer> pushed?
[08:38:53] <arschmitz> um let me check
[08:39:12] <arschmitz> yup
[08:39:23] <jzaefferer> this seems pointless: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/commit/41b3e95aec569441dbbd820615f9cadee5240da9
[08:39:27] <arschmitz> but i have some local changes 
[08:39:48] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: execpt this will probably land before button
[08:39:53] <jzaefferer> on top of amd-demos this wouldn't be necessary, and as-is it can't really work due to lots of missing dependencies (anything split out of core)
[08:39:54] <arschmitz> and it will be broken other wise
[08:40:00] <jzaefferer> I'm not talking about button
[08:40:10] <jzaefferer> just core-breakup vs amd-demos
[08:40:27] <arschmitz> the commit you linked to was just moving button into widgets folder?
[08:40:53] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: and none of the dependencies are missing
[08:41:10] <arschmitz> the core file is still there which includes everything
[08:42:30] <jzaefferer> let's take https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/blob/core-breakup/demos/autocomplete/categories.html
[08:42:36] <jzaefferer> references core.js, which doesn't exist
[08:42:46] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: it does exist i added it
[08:42:55] <arschmitz> as i said that pr is not up to date
[08:43:00] <arschmitz> you asked me to add the core file
[08:43:05] <arschmitz> which is done and im testing right now
[08:43:13] <jzaefferer> what does it contain on your disk?
[08:43:44] <jzaefferer> it should be just a list of dependencies, which would still be broken with non-amd-demos
[08:43:46] <arschmitz> oh never mind it just requires everything
[08:43:49] <arschmitz> yup
[08:44:09] <jzaefferer> so the demos are broken?
[08:44:22] <arschmitz> i cant tell you this sec im in the middle of a rebase 
[08:44:26] <arschmitz> but i would assume
[08:44:35] <arschmitz> i dont see how ones that need core would not be :-/
[08:44:56] <jzaefferer> okay, well, that's why I think it would be best to land amd-demos first before changing any demos in the core-breakup branch
[08:45:07] <jzaefferer> otherwise you just end up with hundreds of conflicts
[08:45:27] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its also a single change in the amd demos
[08:45:36] <arschmitz> because it will have to be hard coded into the bootstrap
[08:45:59] <jzaefferer> also?
[08:46:12] <arschmitz> meaning its a lot less work
[08:46:26] <arschmitz> because its changing a single file instead of ~100
[08:46:40] <jzaefferer> right
[08:46:47] <jzaefferer> yeah, that sounds much better, doesn't it?
[08:47:05] <arschmitz> yup
[08:49:45] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: can you land this on jqueryui.com#113: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/d2a170ae277dfd10b1c5 ?
[08:49:57] <arschmitz> yup just a sec
[08:50:10] <jzaefferer> (updated)
[08:50:45] <jzaefferer> I can't push to your repo...
[08:55:40] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: you changed the DB version to an older one?
[08:56:20] <jzaefferer> I updated the gist to remove that
[08:56:32] <jzaefferer> I needed that locally to npm-link the 1.12 compatible version
[08:56:41] <arschmitz> gotcha
[08:58:18] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: done
[09:08:43] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: land it! https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1557#issuecomment-122328667
[09:11:29] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: awesome ill do it when i finish what im doing on the core breakup
[09:11:49] <arschmitz> im way to far into this loop of rebasing and testing to turn back lol
[09:11:50] <jzaefferer> and then you can update core-breakup AGAIN :-)
[09:11:56] <jzaefferer> ttyl
[09:12:00] <arschmitz> later
[11:45:42] <gabrielschulhof> Noooooo!
[11:45:47] <gabrielschulhof> jsperf is back down :(
[11:46:10] <gabrielschulhof> Just as I was finishing my elaborately concocted listview perf test :/
[11:46:12] <gabrielschulhof> Sheesh!
[11:46:20] <gabrielschulhof> I'm actually thinking about deploying it locally.
[11:48:11] <gabrielschulhof> Holy shitsu! https://github.com/jsperf/jsperf.com/issues/18#issuecomment-122220598 "Manual spam"? Wow ... Faith in humanity ... waning rapidly ...
