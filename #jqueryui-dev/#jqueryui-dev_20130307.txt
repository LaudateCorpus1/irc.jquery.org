[06:37:30] <jzaefferer> its not a draft
[06:37:36] <jzaefferer> it showed up in the RSS feed
[06:37:47] <rxaviers> could be the fact it has no categories?

[06:38:56] <rxaviers> (doing it now)
[06:40:26] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, by the way, should we include it in any category?

[08:27:08] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: would you rather do testing once, or land the grund 0.4 update now and do more testing, when switching to other contrib tasks, later? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/867#issuecomment-14327666
[08:27:09] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Pull request #867 by jzaefferer (2mon 1w ago): Build: Migrate to grunt 0.4.
[08:28:43] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we should discuss moving stuff to download builder.
[08:28:52] <scott_gonzalez> I want to get as much code as possible out of grunt.
[08:30:05] <scott_gonzalez> Also, comments like "Should also try to use grunt-contrib-copy and extend that if necessary to make it useful for us." seem strange to me.
[08:30:14] <scott_gonzalez> How much code are we actually writing for file copies?
[08:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> Why do we need another dep for it?
[08:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> Also, for things like rimraf vs. grunt-contrib-clean.
[08:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> I would fully expect rimraf to be more robust.
[08:33:36] <scott_gonzalez> Actually...grunt-contrib-clean is just a wrapper around grunt.file.delete which is mostly just a wrapper around rimraf.

[10:54:53] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, team, jQuery UI holds a comfortable position being known globally, any reason why we don't mention our success cases (eg. known companies using it) on first page? Eg Joomla.
[10:56:16] <scott_gonzalez> We can. I hate picking 4 companies/products.

[11:41:01] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, post table styles done
[11:54:02] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Although I've formatted the html properly, I did not add inline styles in it. Right now, it seems very plain text. I have a suggesting style for this table. Where could we insert that? Into base.css or in a more local scope like in a jquerui custom css (I dont even know if that exists)?
[12:07:38] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: It was working for me when I committed it
[12:07:39] <bot-t> (23 hours 50 mins ago) <gseguin> tell mikesherov: looks like there is an interest in using TravisCI for core and other jQuery project. Not that it's a complex task but I've done it for mobile so ping me when you want to get started on that.

[13:19:45] <mikesherov> tj_vantoll: fine
[13:32:16] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'm porting my grunt-css plugin to grunt-contrib plugins. grunt-contrib-csslint is done, the task does exactly what my grunt-css task used to do. Working on the keepComment option for grunt-contrib-cssmin now. Once that is done, both can replace grunt-css. I'd like to get that into that grunt-0-4 branch then merge it.
[13:34:50] <kborchers> jzaefferer: on a completely unrelated note, i will be in Berlin April 2-7. you should come see me ;)
[13:39:15] <jzaefferer> kborchers: nice. I saw the tweet. I'll be in Berlin a week after that. Have to figure out how to arrange that better.
[13:41:16] <kborchers> jzaefferer: if we can meet up that would be cool but obviously don't go out of your way. i'd be willing to catch a train and meet you somewhere halfway if there is anywhere cool. i'm going to be a total tourist so ‚Ä¶ :)
