[05:59:47] <tj_vantoll> jQuery core doesn't support browser zoom when it comes to dimensions. Correct? (Asking because of http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9964.)

[06:00:40] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I believe that's correct (and a real shame)
[06:02:12] <tj_vantoll> Ok. I haven't dug in, but I believe that's what happening in that issue.
[06:02:31] <tj_vantoll> And it is a shame.
[06:02:42] <tj_vantoll> I wonder if it's the browser itself that returns incorrect values.
[06:02:51] <tj_vantoll> Or distorted ones.

[11:59:51] <agcolom> Hi Alex, just in case you're around... https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/290 
[12:00:07] <agcolom> how about navigate to another page?
[12:00:50] <agcolom> I feel just navigate needs something else, describing where to?
