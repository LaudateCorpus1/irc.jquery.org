[10:02:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! If you're still there: Why do we depend on external/jshint/jshint.js?
[10:02:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: testing works just fine without it.
[10:02:53] <arschmitz> we dont
[10:03:07] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15scottgonzalez opened pull request #7483: Build: Upgrade to QUnit 1.14.0 (06master...06qunit) 02http://git.io/CtRbWA
[10:03:14] <_|Nix|_> So, why is it among our bower deps?
[10:03:20] <arschmitz> thats a devDependencies
[10:04:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: jshint is part of tests
[10:04:17] <arschmitz> cant run tests without it
[10:04:30] <gseguin> external/jshint is there so people can run jshint in the browser, right?
[10:04:48] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Oh, is it?
[10:04:55] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: How do I run jshint in the browser?
[10:05:20] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: not quite sure :D
[10:05:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it should run as part of the normal tests
[10:05:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, even in the browser?
[10:05:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes does for ui
[10:05:42] <gseguin> but from what I remember that's the reason it is there
[10:05:48] <arschmitz> and ours should be the same though not sure i ever actually checked
[10:05:50] <_|Nix|_> Oooh! Aaaaaw!
[10:06:18] <arschmitz> if its not we should probably fix that :)
[10:06:45] <gseguin> I can take care of it on Thursday if it needs to be fixed. 
[10:06:45] <_|Nix|_> I see ... OK ... I can see how UI does it and take a look ...
[10:06:56] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: if it's not working can you file an issue?
[10:07:06] <arschmitz> gseguin: _|Nix|_: well just check to see if it does first
[10:07:13] <arschmitz> i never said it didnt just that i didnt check
[10:07:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I was looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7421 (missing external/jshint/jshint.js) - that's easy to fix.
[10:08:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i filed that because i want to ask gseguin since i couldnt figure out why it was not there in first place
[10:08:12] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yeah just run updateDependencies and git add/commit/push
[10:08:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How is it supposed to run jshint? If I run any given test suite, does it run jshint on the whole shebang, or only on the modules loaded for the tests?
[10:08:19] <arschmitz> since it was in bower.json
[10:08:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no idea honestly
[10:08:51] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I'd have to dig to figure it out
[10:09:00] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah i know how to fix i just wanted to make sure there was not a reason
[10:09:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: If you wanna take care of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7421 as part of looking into jshint-in-the-browser, I'm happy to leave it to you. You're probably far more familiar with the subject than I a,.
[10:09:22] <arschmitz> seemed odd 
[10:09:26] <gseguin> arschmitz: no reason I can think of, besides me forgetting to add it :D
[10:09:43] <gseguin> arschmitz: sounds good
[10:10:03] <gseguin> arschmitz: assigned that issue to me
[10:10:23] <arschmitz> gseguin: also scott_gonzalez is having issues with the php task
[10:10:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Cool!
[10:10:26] <arschmitz> it wont run for him
[10:10:32] <arschmitz> he just filed an issue
[10:10:32] <gseguin> arschmitz: I saw that
[10:10:47] <gseguin> arschmitz: assigned it to myself and will look into it on Thursday
[10:10:52] <arschmitz> gseguin: it works for me though it hung on that task for several minutes i thought it was not going to run
[10:11:04] <arschmitz> but eventually it finished with no errors
[10:17:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IINM, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1610 is probably a clone of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1383, so it should be closed as such.
[10:18:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll check if my fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1383 also fixes that.

[10:53:36] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: Are the tests passing locally with your upgrade to the latest QUnit ?
[11:00:21] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: I only ran button tests (I picked a random suite)
[11:00:42] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see a way to run all the tests at once in the browser and `grunt test` doesn't work for m.e
[11:00:59] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: ok, it seems like integration tests are failing
[11:03:15] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: if you comment out line the "test:demos:src" line 1031 and 1036 you should be able to run `grunt test --type=integration`
[11:03:32] <gseguin> I'll look into the php issue on Thurday
[11:04:59] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: I get the exact same error as before.
[11:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> Since test:demos:dist uses casper, it doesn't work for me.
[11:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the failures with newer QUnit are likely errors in the tests themselves.
[11:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> Like calling start() when the test isn't stopped.
[11:45:55] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: ok I'll review the PR on Thursday and amend it
[11:46:22] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer Have we decided on a directory structure for the "Quick Downloads" on jqueryui.com for 1.11 yet? Is it this https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/blob/master/resources/download/jquery-ui-1.11.0-beta.2.zip?
[11:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I would think so.
[11:50:04] <tj_vantoll> I'm a bit concerned that it doesn't contain the individual (non concatenated) files.
[11:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> If you want individual files why not just use GitHub releases or Bower?
[11:52:29] <tj_vantoll> By only providing the bundles I'm afraid that we're promoting the usage of the concatenated file.
[11:57:23] <tj_vantoll> I feel like we should do something on the main download prompt on jqueryui.com to encourage people to only use the parts of jQuery UI that they need. What that is I'm not sure, and it doesn't have to happen with 1.11, but I think it would help keep people from thinking that jQuery UI is big or bloated.
[11:58:36] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: +1
[11:59:21] <arschmitz> i feel like we say it till we are blue in the face but its not very obvious on either the ui or mobile site that that is the preferred method 
[12:03:08] <tj_vantoll> Agreed. We can think about ideas to make it more obvious.
