[06:59:12] <doesallmagic> Mike Sherov: Draggable Tests: Fix snap test failures in IE8
[07:50:58] <jzaefferer> hey clarkbox, you're here/there?
[07:51:07] <clarkbox> yes
[07:51:09] <jzaefferer> did you see the update on that CLDR ticket?
[07:51:14] <clarkbox> not yet
[07:51:26] <clarkbox> ill check it out
[07:51:27] <jzaefferer> it was closed as fixed, but they won't reply with anything else and I can't tell what actually happened
[07:53:26] <clarkbox> ill look into it
[08:06:26] <clarkbox> here is the source http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/browser#trunk/tools/cldr-apps/src/org/json
[08:06:28] <clarkbox> â€¦ i think
[08:18:57] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: that looks like its just a copy of source code from json.org, so just a generic JSON generator
[08:19:23] <clarkbox> bah
[08:21:40] <jzaefferer> so annoying that they didn't link to commits from that ticket
[08:22:57] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: this looks more interesting: http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/changeset/7886
[08:23:28] <clarkbox> thats it!
[08:23:57] <jzaefferer> specifically http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/browser/trunk/tools/java/org/unicode/cldr/tool/Ldml2JsonConverter.java?rev=7886
[08:24:08] <jzaefferer> "This program converts CLDR data to the JSON format."
