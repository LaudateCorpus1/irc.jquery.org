[06:25:43] <nicolasthery> hello boy
[06:25:58] <nicolasthery> I have an issue on jquery-ui tooltip
[06:26:08] <nicolasthery> is it the right place to discuss it ?
[06:26:50] <nicolasthery> I have the exact code line where a CPU leak occur
[06:27:14] <nicolasthery> I would like to know if you can help me or if it is a bug
[06:28:25] <nicolasthery> As there is nobody yet, I give you what I think
[06:28:47] <nicolasthery> Search for this code chunk in jquery-ui.js, dev version
[06:28:51] <nicolasthery> <// Handle tracking tooltips that are shown with a delay (#8644). As soon>
[06:29:14] <nicolasthery> There is an Interval defined here which is never stopped
[06:29:46] <nicolasthery> It is not stopped when we are clicking too frequently on buttons that have tooltips...
[06:30:40] <nicolasthery> It's hard to reproduce but I have a developper where I could analyse the bug and I found that this specific interval keeps alive (many of them actally, 20 sometimes)
