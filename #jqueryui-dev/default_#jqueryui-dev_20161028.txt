[05:03:36] <jzaefferer> mgol: oversight, let's drop 'em
[05:03:52] <mgol> jzaefferer: ok, I'll apply the changes
[05:04:04] <mgol> I guess we don't need the jquery-ui-future browser set at all then
[05:04:15] <mgol> since it was to distinguish between UI running with jQuery 1.x or newer
[09:19:52] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15carloguli opened issue #8534: Popup fails with query strings that include URI encoded characters 02https://git.io/vXkWD
[09:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> It wasn't an oversight.
