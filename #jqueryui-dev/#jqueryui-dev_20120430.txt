[06:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> WHOA
[06:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> I hadn't seen the new UI yet :-)
[06:19:42] <rworth> purdy
[06:19:49] <jzaefferer> and once more testsuites are stable, we can now just change grunt.js
[06:20:00] <rworth> is this the work of Krinkle ?
[06:20:18] <rworth> slick
[06:20:19] <Krinkle> if you like it, then yes :P
[06:20:20] <jzaefferer> pretty much, yeah
[06:20:27] <rworth> that's awesome Krinkle
[06:20:40] <jzaefferer> okay, looks like reading authTokens from config json file is working, too
[06:20:47] <jzaefferer> no more tokens in public console output
[06:21:19] <jzaefferer> I'll kill the cloned job and update the existing UI job
[06:21:41] <jzaefferer> once the BrowserStack integration is more stable (see #jquery-dev), we can update and reenable the other projects

[06:29:50] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: testing jQuery UI 1.8.20, looking into the placeholderSize fix. Seeing different behavior than 1.8.17.
[06:30:27] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have a reduced test case we can look at?
[06:30:36] <nacin> Going to try.
[06:31:41] <nacin> All I have so far is, 1.8.17 - placeholder is fine, 1.8.19, placeholder height is off, 1.8.20, placeholder is frequently too wide or narrow for width.
[06:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> Is there something in the deafult WordPress install that shows the bug?
[06:32:02] <nacin> yes
[06:32:14] <nacin> try dragging one of the boxes on the Dashboard page
[06:32:45] <nacin> our sortable is at wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.sortable.min.js
[06:34:25] <rworth> perhaps http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8135
[06:36:04] <nacin> that's the .19 regression, I was hoping http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8262 would fix it. it did, but something is still off.
[06:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have boxes on my Dashboard :-P
[06:38:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, THOSE boxes.
[06:38:10] <nacin> yeah.
[06:40:26] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...looks like it's based on the size of the inner content, not the element.

[06:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: The sortable item is apparently hidden at the time that we calculate the size.
[06:49:04] <scott_gonzalez> Any idea why that's happening?
[06:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> I honestly have no idea if that's UI or WP doing that. I don't know much about sortable.
[06:49:37] <scott_gonzalez> But that's the cause of the problem.
[06:50:10] <nacin> I asked koopersmith to look. Not sure if it's us, but wouldn't be surprised.
[06:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it's probably us.
[06:50:49] <nacin> sortable appears to set it visibility: hidden
[06:50:52] <scott_gonzalez> You're using helper: "clone"
[06:51:15] <scott_gonzalez> I bet we hide the original before creating the placeholder when using a clone.
[06:58:10] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/7303c35831e38e800be1
[06:58:23] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, rworth, nacin: Does that look good ^
[06:58:34] <nacin> that's basically what I'm testing now
[06:58:50] <scott_gonzalez> Sortable is smart enough to only call that method as needed, so perf shouldn't be an issue.
[06:59:31] <rworth> looks good
[07:00:27] <nacin> still seeing things slightly off due to a quirk in how our sortable is set up.
[07:00:58] <nacin> our two columns (or 3, or 4) are not necessarily equal width. in fact on the edit post page, they are decidedly different width.
[07:01:45] <nacin> the previous code did not force a width, and the placeholder's original width was used.
[07:02:09] <rworth> nacin can each child theme have code in it that enables plugins? We don't want to have to log in to wp-admin to do that, and we don't want all of them network activated
[07:02:13] <nacin> for what it's worth, the original bug report was only with regards to height. maybe they should be treated differently?
[07:02:34] <nacin> rworth: we could put it in an install script. for now, I would just use wp-admin.
[07:02:39] <rworth> ok
[07:02:41] <scott_gonzalez> The width look good to me even on the edit page.
[07:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'm seeing very short placeholders on the edit page though.
[07:02:57] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: dragging a meta box from the right column to the main column?
[07:03:03] <nacin> with the patch?
[07:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the placeholder is expanding to the correct width as it changes columns.
[07:04:14] <nacin> Definitely not seeing that.
[07:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> Screen share?
[07:04:39] <nacin> Sure.
[07:04:49] * rworth got all the multi-sites running with local.
[07:11:37] <koopersmith> rworth: :)
[07:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, we're just going to revert both fixes and go back to the 1.8.18 behavior.
[07:12:53] <rworth> nacin how difficult is an install script? I can start on it, or just wait until you have time...
[07:13:03] <scott_gonzalez> We at least know that all existing pages "work" with that code.
[07:13:48] <nacin> rworth: kind of a pain. but I have time this week.
[07:13:57] <rworth> ok, cool
[07:15:14] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: thanks for your help.

[08:03:00] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: maybe you've got an idea wth is going on here? http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/tooltip/default.html - open console, then tab through the three tooltipped elements. Tab out from the last one, and you should see the first element getting a tooltip. If you log document.activeElement, it'll also show up. Yet it doesn't get an outline and tabbing is broken
[08:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not seeing that happen.
[08:04:42] <scott_gonzalez> Don't you have a busted Chrome install or something?
[08:07:26] <jzaefferer> I do, on Firefox 11 the last tooltip sticks around
[08:07:50] <jzaefferer> There tabbing out of the input does not hide the tooltip
[08:07:58] <jzaefferer> If I tab back to the previous element, it hides
[08:10:42] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: not seeing that either?
[08:12:09] <scott_gonzalez> Let me open Firefox.
[08:13:49] <jzaefferer> *chirp chirp chirp
[08:13:56] <jzaefferer> :-)
[08:14:26] <jzaefferer> btw works fine in Chrome Canary
[08:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I see the bug in Firefox.
[08:15:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look into that in a bit.
[08:21:02] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: its about the document.activeElement check on line 182
[08:21:21] <jzaefferer> seems like that is messed up when you tab out of the last tabbable on a page
[08:21:43] <jzaefferer> would also help explaining why its different between "stable" Chrome and Canary
[08:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Just to double check, can you verify that 1-8-stable works for oyu?
[08:35:17] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: okay, looking.
[08:37:40] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Does my suggested fix sound good to you? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8282
[08:37:51] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: looks good.

[11:11:01] <rworth> nacin cool. Any chance I can do the same with xml_rpc? I tried before, but without the pre_option_
[11:11:32] <nacin> hm. I recall writing it at some point already.
[11:12:02] <nacin> I included it in https://gist.github.com/2500819, looks like it didn't make it into gw-xmlrpc.php.
[11:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Yeah, that's my fault.
[11:12:26] <nacin> Simple one-liner, drop it into either gw-xmlrpc.php or jquery-filters.php
[11:12:31] <rworth> cool
[11:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> I wanted gw-xmlrpc.php to be something that can be released for use with grunt-wordpress.
[11:13:15] <rworth> makes sense
[11:13:20] <rworth> I'll add it to jquery-filters.php
[11:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> Forcing XML-RPC to be enabled seems like something specific to web-base-tempalte.
[11:13:26] <rworth> yup
[11:13:35] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the tricky thing is jquery-filters.php is required too :-P
[11:13:54] <rworth> jquery-filters.php only turns off smilies at this point
[11:13:58] <nacin> anyone else running grunt-wordpress can just click the checkbox.
[11:14:00] <rworth> are you thinking of slugs?
[11:14:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I was thinking of slugs.
[11:14:25] <nacin> that's still particular to jQuery's setup.
[11:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Right, that's why I didn't put it in the version I committed.
[11:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I need the slugs code for grunt-wordpress to work.

[11:15:44] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: ah, I see. whatever you think is best, based on how you want to release things.
[11:16:04] <nacin> fwiw, the slugs code is pretty lame, and isn't particularly forward-thinking.
[11:16:44] <nacin> as it basically freezes sanitize_title_for_dashes() in time. I'm still trying to think of ways to make that more elegant.
[11:20:43] <rworth> nacin still neither filter working for me locally. I also checked on stage.sizzlejs.com with the latest web-base-template :(
[11:21:07] <nacin> rworth: will check
[11:35:41] <nacin> rworth: I was on autopilot when writing that gist as well as the original filter. HEAD should be good now, for both.
[11:37:28] <rworth> nacin works great, thanks
[13:22:52] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 2 new commits to 1-8-stable: http://git.io/Dmuxkg
[13:22:52] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Tagging the 1.8.20 release. - Scott González
[13:22:52] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Updating the 1-8-stable version to 1.8.21pre - Scott González
[14:14:17] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: do you plan to push 1.8.20 to jqueryui.com today?
[14:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> Working on it right now.
[14:15:08] <scott_gonzalez> It's already tagged in GitHub and pushed to Google Code.
[14:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> Next up is changelog and blog post.
[14:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> Blog post and site go live at the same time.
[14:15:51] <nacin> cool. I saw the tag, wasn't sure. our release process takes a good 30 minutes too.
[14:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> Our release process is a mess right now :-/
[14:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> Only half is automated.
[14:17:09] <scott_gonzalez> There's a mix of Git and SVN.
[14:17:33] <scott_gonzalez> Plus SVN externals for some ridiculous reason.
[14:18:05] <nacin> Which are as bad as git submodules.
[14:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> We actually have to stage the site halfway through the release in order to generate the themes.
[14:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, releases also involve me manually contacting Microsoft and Google to update their CDNs.
[14:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> Which is the step I'm on right now...
[14:19:46] <nacin> Hah.
[14:19:57] <nacin> We have to contact Microsoft for their web app gallery.
[14:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I'm almost done, but dinner is ready.
[14:39:34] <scott_gonzalez> It'll have to wait until after my kids go to bed.
[14:41:18] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: no problem. Is there a build anywhere? or shall I just build it?
[14:44:50] <scott_gonzalez> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui/downloads/list
[14:48:13] <nacin> great. oh, you said Google code. Read that as the CDN.
[15:22:19] <jzaefferer> nacin: Its actually both. We're putting it on Google Code, but someone at Google does the CDN thing
[15:28:08] <nacin> jzaefferer: right. thanks.
[15:45:46] <jzaefferer> gnarf: saw the stage.swarm domain - nginx is nice and everything, but for that to work we need to port the .htaccess stuff as well; I don't even know where to begin. Would be nice if we could deploy the QUnit site first, swarm can wait a little longer now that the existing install is back up again
[15:47:08] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah, its something for me to work on a little though - the htaccess shouldn't be too hard to express as nginx rewrites
[15:47:31] <gnarf> jzaefferer: right now i'm kinda waiting on 2 things before I can move any further with the wordpresses
[15:47:43] <jzaefferer> okay
[15:48:01] <jzaefferer> well, for testswarm we also need node 0.6.x and some current mysql
[15:48:12] <jzaefferer> along with jenkins
[16:32:01] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i'll prolly play with those tonight
[18:46:24] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: It's live! :-)
[18:47:12] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: thanks. I dropped it into our trunk a few hours ago. we pushed our beta to tomorrow though, so didn't end up mattering a whole lot.
[18:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> heh, well I wanted to get it out today anyway.
