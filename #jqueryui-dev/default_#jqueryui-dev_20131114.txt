[02:27:24] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[02:27:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how was Canada?
[02:29:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[02:29:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Busy.
[02:29:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is that list swipe demo working? not sure if I understand what it does
[02:29:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It reveals buttons underneath list items if you swipe.
[02:31:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: like this http://wil.to/swipe-to-reveal/ ?
[02:31:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess, except the latter does not work in my FF.
[02:32:53] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[02:32:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We're thinking about porting our web-ui-fw swipelist plugin to jQM 1.4.
[02:33:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we could actually ship it somewhere between 1.5-2.0 as a new feature - if it looks good/desirable/interesting.
[02:37:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: on itself I think it's an interesting feature
[02:37:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but only for mobile so it would have to be an extension to listview in the Mobile repo
[02:38:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right ...
[02:47:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: BTW: #6703 is not that bad. In IE7 you get a JS error because, although jQM does nothing on C-grade, the file fails to parse.
[02:48:05] <_|Nix|_> ... and my autocomplete is not working, because my usual IRC died ...

[03:20:31] <Bernardao> Hi everyone, what is the equivalent to:
[03:20:32] <Bernardao> $(document).on('click', '#message_answer', function(e) {
[03:20:32] <Bernardao> using 
[03:20:32] <Bernardao> $(document).click('#message_answer', function(e) {
[03:20:32] <Bernardao> it's not working in the same way
[03:25:04] <_|Nix|_> Bernardao: The channel #jquery is for questions about jQuery. However, IINM, .click() does not support delegation, whereas .on() does.
[03:26:06] <Bernardao> upps sorry, wrong channel, thank you anyway for your answer  :D

[04:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> Does the styling look wrong for others in Chrome? http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html
[04:48:10] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The height of box is larger than the height of the dropdown arrow.
[04:50:24] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: http://gabrielschulhof.github.io/misc/combobox.png
[04:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder when that broke. I think it's a change in Chrome, not our code.
[04:50:49] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That can happen.
[04:51:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, confirmed. Now tracking down the specific version.
[04:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> Broke in Chrome 24.

[05:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> Is this something we want to support? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9658
[05:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> Seems reasonable to me.
[05:03:52] <tj_vantoll> I say yes.

[05:04:05] <tj_vantoll> At the very least there's a documentation issue.
[05:04:11] <tj_vantoll> But this seems reasonable.
[05:08:11] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I can take core of ui DB (about node 0.10)
[05:08:42] <rxaviers> what due date do you expect to have it done? like 1,2 weeks?
[05:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: 1 - 2 weeks would be great. Honestly, I just want it done by the end of the year.
[05:14:46] <scott_gonzalez> We're not going to hit any blockers by staying on 0.8.x for a while.
[05:15:05] <rxaviers> great ok
[05:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> And there's no known date for 0.12.x coming out yet.
[05:49:31] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: Re: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html That's a rounding bug in Chrome which happens if you use em values for padding
[05:50:54] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: in older versions of Chrome the top and bottom padding of the input would have been 3px, but now it is 3.3px
[05:51:02] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[05:51:28] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know if 3.3px is the technically correct value or is this an actual bug?
[05:51:29] <uGoMobi> 2 * .3 = .6 --> an extra px
[05:52:15] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: there is a bunch of discussion about rounding errors in chrome somewhere
[05:52:30] <uGoMobi> I am not sure if it's technically correct
[05:52:36] <arschmitz> and they have basically said they don't care 
[05:53:04] <uGoMobi> not sure if the specs say something about when a browser should round values
[05:54:26] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: if i recall they said the differences are so small they should not matter even though it was repetedly pointed out that it does make a real difference ( just like in this case )
[05:54:27] <uGoMobi> this is a related ticket https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=153584
[05:55:00] <arschmitz> im trying to find the previous discussion i had with them now
[05:56:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: We don't support full-width flipswitch widgets, right?
[05:57:04] <arschmitz> nope
[05:57:06] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[05:57:12] <_|Nix|_> Just checking.
[05:57:50] <arschmitz> a full width flip switch seems awkward
