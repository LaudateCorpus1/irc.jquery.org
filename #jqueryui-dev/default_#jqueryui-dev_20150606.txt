[14:04:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: pong!
[15:53:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: About page classes option. I don't remember what we decided about the dialog widget (if anything). Do I update the tests to use qunit-asser-classes? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8121#issuecomment-98380896 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8121#issuecomment-108855397
[15:56:20] <arschmitz> oh we never did actually discuss
[15:56:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so we didn't decide anything
