[12:48:01] <gnarf> anyone around mind peeking at that branch and giving a little feedback?
[12:57:41] <gnarf> so, I've noticed that jQuery UI doesn't seem to use e.which
[13:08:53] <gnarf> hrm, design opinion
[13:09:05] <gnarf> if the input has 11/1(_)/__
[13:09:15] <gnarf> the (_) marking the cursor position
[13:09:25] <gnarf> and lets make that 11/1(_)/1_
[13:09:37] <gnarf> if you type a 1 in where the cursor position is
[13:09:43] <gnarf> should the other 1 move to the right?
[13:09:54] <gnarf> or should it just fill in the placeholder?
[13:53:46] <gnarf> hrm... I really kinda like the grammar of the test suite josh is using for his maskedInput
[14:18:36] <danheberden> heads up, clarkbox got the view.jqueryui.com script running beautifully and we merged with my original index/form so its the best of both worlds now at view.jqueryui.com
[14:54:39] <gnarf> danheberden: nice
[22:38:59] <jzaefferer> danheberden: nice! now the question is, which one is the real master? there are two links...
[22:59:39] <gnarf> heh
[22:59:57] <gnarf> jzaefferer: I'm working on porting over all of josh's tests into qunit
[23:00:34] <gnarf> I wanna try to solve the "hours" "minutes" type placeholders
