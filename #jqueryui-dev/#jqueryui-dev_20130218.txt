[12:27:25] <jzaefferer> no, doesallmagic said that

[12:28:42] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ah right!
[12:28:55] <rxaviers> I guess we'll need to install IM there as well :P
[12:30:12] <rxaviers> gnarf, u know who can help me? We need to install that IM .deb in jenkins as well ^
[12:30:38] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: do you have access to the infrastructure repo?
[12:30:49] <jzaefferer> and experience with puppet?
[12:30:56] <rxaviers> I do, although not much familiar with it
[12:31:08] <rxaviers> not very much, but seems quick to learn
[12:33:03] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, if you point me where I should start there, it would be a great bootstrap
[12:34:03] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez, kborchers : Got the reason we used sortable cancel!
[12:34:19] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: just to eff with people, right?
[12:34:21] <kborchers> :P
[12:34:30] <Dave_Stein> so we have a bunch of connected sortables
[12:34:42] <Dave_Stein> and one of those sortables is a droppable
[12:35:00] <Dave_Stein> and if i drop on that sortable, i need to cancel the prior sort, to not affect the origin sort
[12:35:12] <Dave_Stein> since it's always sorting while im dragging to different sorts
[12:35:48] <Dave_Stein> cause it's invalid in that one case
[12:36:16] <Dave_Stein> im guessing we should be just disabling that top droppable when the sort is started so it cant happen
[12:37:11] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: gnarf is really the right person to talk to about that

[13:50:50] <scott_gonzalez> Changing offset to position?
[13:51:34] <scott_gonzalez> We want to use .offset()
[13:52:34] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: God damn simulator is making my test pass even though it should be failing. You want to use position since it's going into a parent
[13:53:37] <Dave_Stein> otherwise you'll get that it's 500px below and you can't set it to top 500px cause inside an aboslute div it will be too low in the div

[13:56:54] <Dave_Stein> ah never used offset like that before
[13:56:55] <scott_gonzalez> Nobody should ever have to do position math, unless they're working on the implementation of .position() or .offset() :-)
[13:57:07] <Dave_Stein> i wasnt gonna use math 
[13:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> If you weren't going to use math, then were you going to use .offsetParent() ?

[14:52:37] <Dave_Stein> taking a break before doing backCompats :)
[14:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: I don't think droppables should be looking down the DOM.
[14:56:03] <scott_gonzalez> The greedy droppable should signify that the drop was already handled.
[14:56:30] <scott_gonzalez> The simplest solution is probably just a variable outside of the instances.
[14:56:48] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: The current implementation is looking UP the dom
[14:56:52] <Dave_Stein> with a lot more lines
[14:56:57] <Dave_Stein> around the widget
[14:57:28] <Dave_Stein> line 332 is fun
[15:34:36] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Also, I think IE events are async so I don't think you can flag things as they happen during bubble
[16:53:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you here?
[16:53:15] <gnarf> jzaefferer: ping to read this too
[16:54:29] <gnarf> was just looking at http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/uzfRP/ (line 43 in the js in particular) --- I think we should write something that can do this reading of the default options from data-* in a nice generic way into the widget factory, or at least a helper
[16:57:17] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Events are sync in all browsers. If they were async the world would collapse.
[16:57:27] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Perhaps you're thinking of async focus in IE?
[16:57:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I refuse to put that into the widget factory.
[16:58:28] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Also, I already wrote the generic version. Just look at mobile.widget.
[16:58:42] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Ah yes I was
[16:59:04] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: I was about to do droppable backCompat and I noticed I overwrote _setOption TWICE between two of them in draggable so fixing em now
[16:59:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: awesome, thats what i was talking about :)
[17:00:08] <Dave_Stein> i did just notice that "draggable: options: { handle: 'span' } (1, 1, 2)Rerun" is broken *sigh* ill have to take a look later altho im not sure why that would be bad all of a sudden

[17:15:16] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez why use a jQuery function when I can use typeof?
[17:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> Because you can't use typeof reliably in browsers.

[17:31:41] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: scope in draggable says : Used to group sets of draggable and droppable items, in addition to droppable's accept option. A draggable with 
[17:31:58] <Dave_Stein> in droppable it says: "Used to group sets of draggable and droppable items, in addition to the accept option."
[17:32:07] <Dave_Stein> but in reality it's "in addition" if it's not "default" right?
[17:32:30] <Dave_Stein> since by default both draggable and droppable have "default" as the value for scope, which would mean "accept" is just BS since it would always match
[17:32:30] <Dave_Stein> :D
[17:32:52] <Dave_Stein> im guessing the default should have been false rather than that silly string
