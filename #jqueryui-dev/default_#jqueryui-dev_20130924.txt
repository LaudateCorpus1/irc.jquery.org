[06:40:59] <uGoMobi> welcome back ZNC :)
[06:42:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: emilsedgh_ is actually right about the tollerances on swipe
[06:42:29] <arschmitz> i had been adjusting them and somehow committed the wrong value for the horizontal one
[06:42:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah there seems to be something wrong there
[06:42:54] <arschmitz> its only 30px right now it used to be 200 
[06:43:05] <arschmitz> i think 200 is too much but 30 is WAY to little
[06:43:24] <uGoMobi> yeah something like 100 maybe?
[06:43:33] <arschmitz> thats exactly what i was thinking
[06:43:39] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:43:46] <arschmitz> because flipswitch is ~100px wide
[06:44:06] <arschmitz> so i wont it to still feel natural for flipsiwtch but make it a more reasonable amount
[06:44:39] <uGoMobi> there is a ticket "ideas for swipe'" or something like that. maybe that ticket is about same problem (and we can close after you changed the value)
[06:45:02] <arschmitz> yeah ill check that out
[06:45:35] <arschmitz> im thinking about now that ios7 is out revisiting the calculation of the vertical offset too
[06:46:00] <arschmitz> since the problem was only in ios4 and old opera
[06:46:29] <arschmitz> probably not for beta 1 but maybe for 1.4.1
[06:47:14] <arschmitz> its a substantial bug that we have never been able to fix
[06:47:41] <uGoMobi> would be nice
[06:48:32] <arschmitz> and i have a hard time still justifiying that we cant fix it because of old platforms since we have way higher percentage of users on the busted platforms
[06:48:58] <arschmitz> so if one needs to be busted better the smallest percentage of users

[07:13:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, yeah, but isHashChangeEnabled: function() { return $.mobile.hashListeningEnabled === true; }, so, like I said, my head was spinning :)
[07:14:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i was just speaking generally
[07:14:18] <RWhitbeck> ugomobi can I make minor edits right in the post?
[07:14:25] <arschmitz> we have a lot of things i keep finding on $.mobile that are just a refrence to something deeper on $.mobile
[07:14:41] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: sure, feel free to edit
[07:15:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wish we could just use property accessors ... st00pid IE.

[07:18:47] <RWhitbeck> Are the beta 1 demos up on view.jquerymobile.com?
[07:20:15] <scott_gonzalez> RWhitbeck: beta 1 hasn't been released yet.
[07:20:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh i wanted to ask you something can you think of any change you made to panels that would cause resize events to take place when you scroll with a panel open?
[07:21:16] <uGoMobi> hmm
[07:21:49] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: the beta 1 demos wil look like master now
[07:24:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: something in the new JS is causing it it did not happen in 1.3
[07:24:48] <arschmitz> and thats what causes the snap back to top
[07:25:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looking at the JS now
[07:25:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool i scanned over it but there is nothing that reacts to scroll or anything 
[07:26:01] <arschmitz> and its happening on internal panels 
[07:26:14] <uGoMobi> fact is that a lot of things are now done when opening a panel instead of when initializing the panel
[07:26:34] <uGoMobi> only internal panel?
[07:26:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah but if they only happen when it opens that should still be fine
[07:26:44] <uGoMobi> all modes: reveal, push and overlay?
[07:26:49] <arschmitz> not sure if its only internal but it is reported on internal
[07:26:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i didnt check that i will though
[07:27:02] <uGoMobi> (can't test easily right now)
[07:27:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats fine i can i just wanted to pick your brain since you made a lot of the changes 
[07:27:47] <RWhitbeck> UGoMobi under "New Features" it says Alpha 1 I assume you meant Beta 1?
[07:27:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill see if its anypanel or if i can narrow it down to certain combinations
[07:28:11] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: nope
[07:28:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it for sure has NOTHING to do with swipe though
[07:28:18] <RWhitbeck> ugomobi yep I see what you did now
[07:28:21] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: we split them up
[07:28:59] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: if we need to make that more clear, please make the change
[07:29:20] <uGoMobi> like remove alpha 1 and just say alpha 2 vs alpha 1 and beta 1 vs alpha 2
[07:30:31] <_|Nix|_> OK. Weird. When I try to make the demos a fullscreen app, the suggestion for the title is "jQuery Mobil"[sic] ... can we fix that?
[07:32:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: only if you know how to make jQuery Mobile have less letters?
[07:32:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, there's no meta tag or anything for that, eh?
[07:32:37] <arschmitz> no it takes the title and uses the first X letters i believe
[07:32:51] <arschmitz> X = 12
[07:33:51] <uGoMobi> there was a ticket to change the project name, sorry I closed it
[07:35:11] <_|Nix|_> Also, can someone please tell me how to make a fullscreen app on iOS? I did "Add to Home Screen", but when I click on the icon on the home screen, it just opens in Safari, with location bar 'n all.
[07:35:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats a meta tag :)
[07:35:56] <arschmitz> we used to have a demo page with the tag to do it
[07:36:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, that's right!
[07:36:17] <RWhitbeck> _|Nix|_  <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
[07:36:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You navigate to /that/ page and you make your fullscreen app from there.
[07:36:43] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: Thanks!
[07:37:23] <RWhitbeck> _|Nix|_ then there is the splash screen code too‚Ä¶ here's an example I did https://github.com/appendto/devlink-mobile-2013/blob/master/index.html#L9-L13
[07:38:59] <RWhitbeck> uGoMobi I think it would be great if we can link to the demo's of each of these features on this line "Some of the new features that come with this release are a flip switch widget, a generic filter widget named ‚Äúfilterable‚Äù, popups with arrows, tooltips for sliders and we integrated the tabs widget from jQuery UI."
[07:39:44] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: I want to do that in the final release blog post
[07:40:00] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: and add some screenshots as well
[07:40:35] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: I want to wait because demos are not completely updated yet
[07:40:42] <RWhitbeck> ah ok
[07:43:32] <uGoMobi> I will be offline for a while
[07:44:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : looks like we can release today, right?

[07:46:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i commented on your PR
[07:46:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: whats the bug?
[07:46:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks!
[07:46:29] <_|Nix|_> When you open a dialog from demos/pages-dialog the whole page blinks briefly before the transition to the dialog starts.

[07:48:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: dialog pages aren't updated yet
[07:48:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: looks like there is a problem with the demos header
[07:48:27] <arschmitz> the panel button is in the middle of the jqm logo
[07:48:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: wonder if using page widget with option dialog resolves this

[07:50:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im looking now
[07:50:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course, this manual resize upon opening the panel does not account for the document height changing as a result of asynchronous DOM manipulation of elements in the underlying page.
[07:51:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, if you have data coming in asynch ...
[07:51:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: when you say a blink do you mean the just going to a plain white page?
[07:51:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well there is no real way to deal with that
[07:52:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No. The page briefly disappears and then reappears, and then the transition commences.
[07:52:08] <arschmitz> we cant know if they are doing something else if they are they need to call resize themselves
[07:52:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm on my iphone4 with ios6 i dont see that
[07:52:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lemme film it.
[07:54:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i see it now
[07:54:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll stop trying to film it.
[07:54:59] <arschmitz> i think it just depends on the transition maybe because the first one was not doing it and then when i tried others it happens
[07:56:01] <arschmitz> very odd though because it appears to be pre-transition
[07:56:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[07:56:34] <arschmitz> im going to see if it happens on ios7 too
[07:57:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.

[11:41:23] <uGoMobi> tested on Safari iOS 6 / iPad retina
[12:07:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can reproduce every time
[12:07:17] <arschmitz> on iphone4 ios6
[12:18:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its internal / external / push / reveal / overlay happens in every case
[12:20:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it is weird because I could reproduce it too
[12:20:21] <arschmitz> maybe it does not happen on ipad only i phone?
[12:20:33] <uGoMobi> only thing that I do notice is that sometime page scrolls to top unexpected
[12:20:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats the problem 
[12:20:44] <uGoMobi> I reproduced it on my iPad before
[12:20:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: huh
[12:21:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but before the problem was you couldn't scroll anymore
[12:21:17] <arschmitz> it will all of a sudden scroll back to the top every time you scroll the page
[12:21:37] <uGoMobi> that's also how the OP describes the issue
[12:22:15] <arschmitz> that was fixed but both you and the op then say it does the snap to top still
[12:22:16] <uGoMobi> and I remember I could reproduce that
[12:22:26] <uGoMobi> ahaaaa
[12:22:40] <arschmitz> that was fixed by https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6235
[12:22:40] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6235 by jamiepk (1mon 3w ago): swipeleft/swiperight seems to lock vertical scrolling on 1.4
[12:22:50] <arschmitz> and was originally closed as a duplicate of
[12:23:01] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[12:23:08] <uGoMobi> I missed that
[12:23:09] <arschmitz> but then once that was fixed the snap to top behavior was noticed 
[12:23:16] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:23:32] <uGoMobi> you can see that on iOS Chrome too
[12:23:43] <uGoMobi> ok let's look into that
[12:23:57] <arschmitz> yeah im not surprised since its just a web view 
[12:24:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and it easily reporduced with the panel in demos too
[12:25:08] <arschmitz> something is causing a resize event to be fired when you scroll with the panel open
[12:25:18] <arschmitz> and what ever it is didnt happen in 1.3
[12:27:46] <uGoMobi> first thing I think about is _positionPanel
[12:28:04] <arschmitz> thats what causes it but that just happens inresponse to resize
[12:28:19] <arschmitz> so thats not the root cause
[12:30:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm so there is a large horizontal scroll bar on iphone when the panel is open
[12:30:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz overflow-x hidden for page may be the cause
[12:31:22] <arschmitz> maybe let me try
[12:34:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: fixes the scroll bar but not the snapping to top
[12:34:16] <uGoMobi> hmm ok
[12:35:08] <arschmitz> ok take that back it does not fix the scroll bar it just only happens on left panels
[12:42:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: are there any markup changes between 1.3 and 1.4?
[12:42:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no
[12:43:19] <arschmitz> ok and i know its not css i ruled that out already
[12:43:37] <arschmitz> well css from the css file might be something we apply with js
[12:44:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: have you already tested on android?
[12:45:23] <arschmitz> no
[12:45:42] <arschmitz> it does not happen on ios7 though
[12:49:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe we have to a bisect
[12:49:51] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:49:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I suggest we release beta now
[12:50:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im fine with that
[12:50:10] <uGoMobi> it's getting a bit late
[12:50:16] <arschmitz> yup
[12:50:24] <arschmitz> have not seen gseguin today
[12:50:25] <uGoMobi> good to know it doesn't happen in iOS7
[12:50:32] <uGoMobi> he is around
[12:50:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[12:50:33] <gseguin> I'm here
[12:50:35] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ping
[12:50:37] <uGoMobi> see :)
[12:50:52] <gseguin> beta.1 ?
[12:50:53] <gseguin> ok
[12:50:57] <uGoMobi> gseguin: want to release?
[12:50:58] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:51:00] <gseguin> let me update my workspace
[12:51:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what do we need to add to the changelog?
[12:51:40] <uGoMobi> deprecated $.mobile.activePage
[12:51:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i had added it this morning under the beta 1 headings
[12:52:17] <gseguin> I'm ready when you are
[12:52:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i fixed data-defaults to actually work im not sure if we had even documented it yet though
[12:53:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and i dont see deprecation of style options in there
[12:53:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I asked bot to tell you that we wait with that until 1.5
[12:53:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: whats the reason?
[12:53:58] <uGoMobi> so we have a bit more time to look into good way to make new and old way work next to eachother
[12:54:18] <uGoMobi> you cannot simply use wrapperClasses option
[12:54:22] <gseguin> so someone gives me the go
[12:54:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok though i really think they are just incompatible so the end result will be the same either way
[12:54:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we discusses some backcompat code, right
[12:55:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: kinda its a bit wonky though if you ask me
[12:55:14] <uGoMobi> and _|Nix|_ suggested setting style options to null when option wrapperClasses has value other than ""
[12:55:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats not really valid you could want to use both
[12:55:49] <uGoMobi> exactly
[12:55:56] <uGoMobi> so I wasn't in favor of that
[12:56:02] <arschmitz> and if we document wrapper class now we can change it next time to do that
[12:56:14] <arschmitz> cant*
[12:57:01] <arschmitz> any way im fine either way i just think that it will be the same either way and the two different ways cannot be fully compatible
[12:57:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: could be, it's just that I think we shouldn't make changes like this last minute before beta release
[12:58:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: execpt its not a change lol its only documentation change not code change
[12:58:22] <uGoMobi> was in doubt about that already, but now we are still not sure how to do it I think we should wait one version
[12:58:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but for users it is a change
[12:58:49] <arschmitz> yes
[12:58:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I want to use the new recommended way but I can't
[12:59:06] <uGoMobi> unless I use enhanced option as well
[12:59:13] <uGoMobi> during one version
[12:59:16] <arschmitz> and you still wont be able to when we do it next version either
[12:59:55] <arschmitz> anyway it does not matter it just prolongs it one version
[12:59:59] <uGoMobi> could be, but then at least we have bit more time to make demos for it
[13:01:20] <gseguin> so?
[13:01:26] <uGoMobi> if we go back to original plan to release a new version every 3 or 4 months it's big problem to wait
[13:01:30] <uGoMobi> sorry gseguin 
[13:01:43] <uGoMobi> it's not*
[13:01:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: green light?
[13:01:54] <arschmitz> yup
[13:02:01] <uGoMobi> gseguin: go for it
[13:02:06] <uGoMobi> gseguin:  thanks!
[13:04:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't see $.mobile.activePage under deprecated here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog
[13:05:05] <uGoMobi> can you check if something is missing?
[13:05:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its the very last thing in the page
[13:05:48] <uGoMobi> Deprecated $.mobile.activePageClass, $.mobile.activeBtnClass, $.mobile.focusClass
[13:06:03] <arschmitz> ok your seeing a different page then i am then
[13:06:11] <arschmitz> because there are 2 things after that
[13:06:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: at the bottom what does it show for last edited by and when?
[13:06:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nasty cache or something
[13:06:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I do see it in incognito now
[13:06:49] <uGoMobi> sorry
[13:06:50] <arschmitz> ok
[13:07:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i just realized i forgot to add change content to pagecontainer
[13:07:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: go ahead, I copy to the blog post 
[13:07:49] <arschmitz> ok fixed
[13:08:14] <uGoMobi> thanks
[13:09:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that panel issue is really annoying me i dont see anything that should cause this!
[13:09:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: Back in the saddle ...
[13:09:17] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[13:09:23] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[13:09:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah it's bugging me too since it is a regression
[13:09:46] <arschmitz> and we dont do anything in reaction to scroll
[13:09:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: searching for iOS webkit bugs now
[13:09:51] <_|Nix|_> What is a regression?
[13:09:56] <arschmitz> so i dont know how its triggering resize
[13:10:15] <_|Nix|_> Oh, that snap-to-top thing?
[13:10:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: on ios6 when you scroll with a panel open resize events are being triggered
[13:10:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's because of retina.
[13:10:31] <arschmitz> which causes the panel to reposition and snap to top
[13:10:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I had the same with popup.
[13:10:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You need to ignore them.
[13:11:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no it did not happen in 1.3
[13:11:10] <arschmitz> its new in 1.4 its something we are doing
[13:11:36] * _|Nix|_ grabs his iPod.
[13:11:41] <gseguin> still
[13:14:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Another thing that happens is that it scolls to (0,1), because when I scroll to the top, the location bar keeps disappearing.
[13:15:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah its because throttledresize is being triggered
[13:15:17] <arschmitz> there is a core closed bug about it
[13:15:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I have reproduced it.
[13:18:00] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I pushed to the CDN
[13:18:07] <gseguin> haven't pushed the tags yet
[13:18:19] <gseguin> wanna give it a try
[13:18:23] <uGoMobi> ok, lemme test
[13:19:13] <gseguin> ah shit
[13:19:17] <gseguin> I pushed the zip
[13:19:18] <gseguin> removing
[13:20:23] <uGoMobi> gseguin: this will be the link to the zip, right? http://jquerymobile.com/resources/download/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-beta.1.zip
[13:20:50] <gseguin> should be
[13:21:10] <gseguin> I'm not sure it's part of the release script
[13:21:18] <gseguin> I'll make sure it goes there
[13:22:20] <uGoMobi> JS and CSS looks good
[13:22:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin: the SHA is of your commit to change the version, correct?
[13:23:01] <gseguin> yeah
[13:23:38] <uGoMobi> ok good to go
[13:23:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: wow im really confused how this does not happen in 1.3
[13:24:02] <gseguin> uploaded the zip to the website
[13:24:14] <arschmitz> i can reproduce the resize events with out a panel
[13:24:20] <arschmitz> and i can reproduce them in 1.3
[13:24:34] <gseguin> pushed the tag

[13:24:55] <gseguin> We've just released 1.4.0-beta.1
[13:25:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: *pop* goes the champagne bottle.
[13:25:14] <gseguin> heh :)
[13:25:15] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Awesome!
[13:25:51] <uGoMobi> awesome!
[13:25:54] <uGoMobi> thanks all!!
[13:27:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmmm ok im coming full circle on this one and am blameing 1.4 css lol 
[13:28:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can reproduce with 1.4 with out panels at all
[13:28:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not the snapping but the events that are causing the snapping
[13:29:01] <arschmitz> i can swap in 1.3 js and keep 1.4 css and i can still reproduce
[13:29:17] <arschmitz> i swap to 1.3 css and js and it goes away
[13:30:46] <uGoMobi> one sec, the blog post key changes and the changelog wiki page are out of sync :/
[13:31:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ugh execpt i can also reproduce with 1.3 css and 1.4 js :(
[13:32:13] <arschmitz> so something somewhere ( not in panel ) has broken throttled resize in 1.4
[13:34:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ^^
[13:37:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Not sure. All I know is I had to deal with a slew of resize events which were happening when I was opening the popup.
[13:37:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: At the time we blamed it on retina.
[13:38:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in this case all there is is a really long page
[13:38:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When you open a popup, you can see a slight shift in the whole display. That is causing resize events.
[13:38:27] <arschmitz> and if you scroll you will get throttled resize events when you scroll
[13:38:40] <arschmitz> no panels not nothing
[13:38:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Have you tried a bisect?
[13:38:49] <uGoMobi> gseguin: what is the link to the demos?
[13:39:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not yet i cant easily do it from here and access with phone
[13:39:06] <arschmitz> i cant port forward
[13:39:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I suspect you were getting resize events before, but the panel was not susceptible to them.
[13:39:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nope
[13:39:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i switched to 1.3 no resize events
[13:39:47] <arschmitz> and im not using panels at all its just a long page that appeds the word resize when a resize event takes place
[13:40:00] <arschmitz> *throttledresize 
[13:40:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/438/edit
[13:40:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you add a popup and see if you're getting resize events?
[13:41:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... upon opening the popup?
[13:41:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sure
[13:42:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nope not from opening popup
[13:43:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, then I have no idea what all that fidgeting was about.
[13:43:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll continue my bisect from here then.
[13:44:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i can reproduce this issue with no widgets on page at all just a page long enough to scroll
[13:45:28] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you still there?

[13:48:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you check if you the 1.4 beta 1 demos somewhere on the server
[13:48:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure
[13:49:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I was using this link http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0-beta.1/dist/demos/
[13:49:28] <gseguin> still here uGoMobi
[13:49:29] <uGoMobi> and also tried jquerymobile.com/demos/1.4.0-beta.1/
[13:49:46] <gseguin> I haven't uploaded that
[13:49:52] <gseguin> let me do it, sorry
[13:49:52] <uGoMobi> gseguin: what is the link to the demos?
[13:49:56] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[13:49:59] <uGoMobi> no problem
[13:50:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ^^
[13:50:29] <arschmitz> ok
[13:50:38] <uGoMobi> thanks
[13:55:55] <gseguin> uGoMobi: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.4.0-beta.1/ is up
[13:56:17] <gseguin> oh wait
[13:56:26] <gseguin> I messed up
[13:59:57] <gseguin> there is a path issue on the links
[14:00:09] <gseguin> I'll remove the demos on the website for now
[14:06:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, d333e8c52bd044a31bde2fdf3b559c679c51fe84 seems to be the first bad commit
[14:06:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's right after "First pass at toolbar widget".
[14:21:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmmm ill try without toolbars in page at all and see if it makes a difference
[14:21:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[14:23:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it does indeed seem related to toolbars
[14:23:27] <_|Nix|_> git bisect 1 - bugs 0.
[14:23:46] <_|Nix|_> Or 2 if you're playing basketball.
[14:24:00] <_|Nix|_> Or 5 if it's American football.
[14:24:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: 6
[14:24:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's only if you convert the kick, isn't it?
[14:24:41] <arschmitz> nope 7 if you convert kick 
[14:24:54] <arschmitz> 8 if you do 2 point conversion
[14:24:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aaah, OK. Off-by-one error on my part - sorry!
[14:25:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in some ways it makes sense toolbars could cause this but i didnt think there were any markup or css changes as a result so its kinda odd
[14:25:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure.
[14:26:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Webkit - gotta love it.
[14:26:07] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:26:34] <arschmitz> and doing a bit of research a lot of people run into this but no details on exact cause
[14:26:44] <arschmitz> or fix
[14:27:38] <uGoMobi> gseguin: should I publish blog post without link to demos for now?
[14:27:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I can always refer you to my hairy-as-a-sasquatch fix from popup *cringe*
[14:28:38] <arschmitz> i think id rather try and fix the actual issue with throttledresize since we essentially broke it
[14:29:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man, that's devious though. The commit I found merely point out the breakage we introduced - who knows when ...
[14:30:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well its clearly related to toolbars
[14:30:48] <arschmitz> so i can gut them until it stops then start adding things back in
[14:31:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Debugging technique https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/22a.
[14:31:18] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #22 by scottjehl (36mon 1w ago): add option to allow listviews to be full-width with square corners, no shadows
[14:31:21] <_|Nix|_> Argh!
[14:31:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Debugging technique # 22a.
[14:31:34] <arschmitz> lol
[14:36:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Haven't you tagged beta? I thought you said you had.
[14:37:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... or my git-fu is not up to par: git fetch origin --tags
[14:41:03] <uGoMobi> ok I just published the announcement
[14:41:09] <uGoMobi> removed the link to the demos
[14:41:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome!
[14:41:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can't find the tag ...
[14:41:31] <uGoMobi> will add it when the demos are up
[14:41:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[14:41:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nice 
[14:42:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so we tracked the issue with ios back to something with toolbars
[14:42:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw that
[14:42:39] <uGoMobi> would have never thought of that
[14:42:56] <arschmitz> ill narrowing it down more tonight
[14:43:21] <uGoMobi> great, thanks
[14:43:29] <arschmitz> see if we cant get this in before rc
[14:48:39] <_|Nix|_> When is rc, anyway?
[14:49:02] <arschmitz> depends how many bugs we get
[14:49:23] <_|Nix|_> That's true.
