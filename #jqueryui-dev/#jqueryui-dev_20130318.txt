[05:15:37] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: Hey Rafael. What's on your plate to work on this week?
[05:15:46] <jzaefferer> What's "next"?
[05:17:10] <rxaviers> I'll start the grunt cleanup from UI to db.
[05:20:46] <jzaefferer> Occasionally interrupted with hotfixes?
[05:21:04] <rxaviers> sure, anyone needing attention?
[05:21:29] <jzaefferer> Nothing in particular, seems like you've got a good grip on that :-)
[05:21:34] <jzaefferer> This should be easy to fix: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/103
[05:21:34] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #103 by jzaefferer (1mon 1w ago): Add grunt-check-modules
[05:22:20] <rxaviers> aha! Im working in this one right now
[05:22:25] <jzaefferer> Also this: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/81
[05:22:25] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #81 by scottgonzalez (2mon 1d ago): Download Builder: Link to previous download page
[05:22:46] <jzaefferer> Maybe https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/66
[05:22:46] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #66 by rxaviers (3mon 2w ago): Grunt: copying should be able to be sync
[05:23:13] <rxaviers> will get to them surely
[05:23:35] <jzaefferer> This would be good to address as well: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/31
[05:23:35] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #31 by scottgonzalez (5mon 6d ago): ThemeRoller: Clean user data and/or prevent invalid inputs
[05:23:41] <jzaefferer> Everything else looks like it can wait
[05:23:42] <rxaviers> actually, one needs urgent https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/117
[05:23:43] <b-ot> rxaviers: Issue #117 by gnarf37 (2w 5d ago): Limit dimensions of generated images.
[05:23:49] <rxaviers> urgency*
[05:23:55] <jzaefferer> Ah, right
[05:24:06] <jzaefferer> That ticket looks harmless, but I guess the underlying issue isn't
[05:24:14] <rxaviers> yeap

[05:30:21] <rxaviers> I knew it was going to happen ^
[05:33:31] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, shall we always rm -Rf node_modules, since now we're checking if they are strictly equal to packages.json?
[05:33:41] <rxaviers> We may hit this issue again if a package is renamed
[05:34:11] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: that happened locally for you?
[05:34:18] <rxaviers> nope, at stage
[05:34:24] <jzaefferer> ah
[05:35:09] <jzaefferer> yeah, I think installing modules from scratch would be more correct
[05:35:29] <jzaefferer> that way we don't have to rely on transitive dependencies with variable version ranges being updates
[05:35:31] <jzaefferer> *updated
[05:35:49] <jzaefferer> and for deploys the few seconds it takes longer don't really matter
[05:48:13] <_zoggy_> so if $browser is gone from jquery now... what does jquery ui do instead or is there no need for it to know the browser anymore
[05:48:30] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, will take that
[05:50:19] <rxaviers> cc scott_gonzalez, gnarf, about installing modules from scratch discussion above ^
[05:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: npm prune
[05:51:50] <rxaviers> ok, gnarf is that ok adding that on the deploy script?
[05:52:24] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: It should be tehre.
[05:52:54] <rxaviers> npm-prune -- Remove extraneous packages
[05:53:07] <rxaviers> excellent scott, that's exactly what we were looking for
[05:53:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...maybe that doesn't run on download builder deploys.
[05:53:38] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm 99% sure it runs on site deploys.
[05:53:46] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure why they would be different.
[05:54:17] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...looks like it doesn't run on site deploys.
[05:54:21] <scott_gonzalez> I know gnarf and I discussed this.
[05:55:15] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Just filed an issue for it: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/170
[05:55:22] <rxaviers> thanks!
[05:56:15] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know where the script lives, otherwise I'd add it.
[05:58:37] <_zoggy_> whoever is responsible for the jqueryui.com website, the #sidebar h3 text is not very clean for me.. the font-size of 1.17em smushes the letters that drop below the baseline like 'e' if it was just a little larger it looks fine

[06:01:23] <_zoggy_> adding browser info now
[06:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that looks pretty bad.
[06:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> Must be a Windows thing.
[06:02:38] <_zoggy_> if the font size is 1.2 or some 'even' multiple it looks much better
[06:02:54] <_zoggy_> or if i change what font it uses, it looks fine at that size
[08:03:27] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: if you log an issue for npm converting package.json to spaces, can you send me the URL?
[08:03:36] <rxaviers> sure

[09:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> Man, all hell has broken loose as a result of removing the base theme.
[09:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> We broke Bower. So that's awesome :-)

[10:52:28] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, stage looks the same
[10:53:11] <_zoggy_> 1.25 or 1.3em looks good
[10:53:25] <_zoggy_> 1.2 is still too smooshed
[10:54:31] <_zoggy_> 1.25em = 18.75px
[10:55:01] <rxaviers> _zoggy_, didnt you test it with 1.2em before and looked good?
[10:55:35] <_zoggy_> i thought i did, it must have been something more though since 1.2 deff has the same issue with the e being a blob
[10:56:11] <_zoggy_> i think i had it at 1.2em earlier but had a different font
[10:56:22] <_zoggy_> since i was seeing if it was just the one you guys used first.. which it is
[10:56:30] <_zoggy_> helvetica/arial looked fine at 1.2
[11:02:18] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: Check now.
[11:03:17] <_zoggy_> its 1.2 still.. looks same as before
[11:03:29] <_zoggy_> cleared cache
[11:03:36] <_zoggy_> looks good now, 1.25

[11:08:11] <_zoggy_> ok
[11:09:06] <Vendethiel> Hi!
[11:09:09] <Vendethiel> ping scott_gonzalez ?
[11:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> Hi Vendethiel
[11:09:25] <_zoggy_> yep looks good
[11:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks _zoggy_.
[11:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> Fonts are annoying. I wish everyone would agree on how they should be rendered.
[11:17:36] <Vendethiel> scott_gonzalez: I'm here for the seperate .css issue, do you have 1min to discuss it :) ?
[11:18:53] <scott_gonzalez> Vendethiel: sure
[11:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> For context, what's your GitHub name?
[11:19:20] <Vendethiel> Nami-Doc
[11:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:19:28] <Vendethiel> sorry 'bout that :p.
[11:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> So, we've got 2 zips, and it looks like you're using both to generate the Bower package.
[11:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> Is that correct?
[11:19:45] <Vendethiel> Yep
[11:20:06] <Vendethiel> I take the separate js files from the stable zip and the themes from the Themes.zip
[11:20:15] <jquicommit> 01[13download.jqueryui.com01] 15rxaviers pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/4mfdaw

[11:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> You could copy themes/base from the stable zip.
[11:21:36] <scott_gonzalez> But it has a different structure than the built themes.
[11:22:53] <Vendethiel> Where are all the themes in the stable zip ?
[11:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: BTW, the new build is adding smoothness to the sable zip.
[11:23:09] <doesallmagic> Project download.jqueryui.com build #157: SUCCESS in 3 min 3 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/download.jqueryui.com/157/
[11:23:09] <doesallmagic> rxaviers: Export named colors variable into a separate file
[11:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Not sure how that's happening.
[11:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> The stable zip only has base.
[11:23:46] <rxaviers> ah let me  check
[11:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, in 1.10.2 it seems to also have smoothness, but it shouldn't.
[11:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> Vendethiel: This is inside the development-bundle directory.
[11:24:49] <Vendethiel> scott_gonzalez: develoment-bundle only has base & smoothness in it
[11:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> Vendethiel: Right, and smoothness shouldn't even be there.
[11:25:28] <Vendethiel> sooo I need to build it everytime ?
[11:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> So what you can do is grab both zips.
[11:25:51] <scott_gonzalez> Take themes-zip/themes as themes.
[11:26:00] <scott_gonzalez> Take stable-zip/development-bundle/ui as ui.
[11:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> Then take stable-zip/development-bundle/themes/base as themes/base.
[11:26:17] <Vendethiel> scott_gonzalez: yes that's what I do, but I don't have the separate css files anymore
[11:26:55] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to add that last step.
[11:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> Vendethiel: My understanding is that Bower only cares about gathering files, not about build processes/dependency management/anything else.
[11:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> Is that correct?
[11:28:03] <Vendethiel> yep
[11:28:24] <scott_gonzalez> So why not just throw the full zip contents into the package?
[11:28:42] <Vendethiel> I'd rather not have so many files
[11:29:10] <Vendethiel> and that doesn't solve the css files problem
[11:29:25] <scott_gonzalez> Sure it does, the CSS files are in the stable zip.
[11:30:17] <Vendethiel> the files for the different themes aren't here
[11:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> That's what the themes zip is for.
[11:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> Honestly, I don't know why you would be concerned about number of files from the stable zip, but then include all the built themes in the package.
[11:59:50] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Im afraid to tell you we have both base and smoothness in the stable package since 1.9.0. This is due to builder be following this definition
[11:59:52] <rxaviers> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/41505725/Download%20Builder%20Rewrite
[11:59:58] <rxaviers> zip
[11:59:58] <rxaviers> |-- development-bundle
[11:59:58] <rxaviers> |   |-- themes
[11:59:58] <rxaviers> |   |   `-- <theme-name>
[11:59:58] <rxaviers> |   |       |   # `theme-name` defaults to "custom-theme" (when any theme is selected), or "no-theme" (when no theme is selected)
[12:00:29] <rxaviers> (or named-theme)
[12:01:02] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, we can make a flag in builder, so it skip this dir.
[12:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: That's not the case for the stable zips.
[12:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/download/all/
[12:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> Only 1.10.2 has that structure.
[12:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> But I can see why this is the case.
[12:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> I think for the quick download we only want base.
[12:09:32] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, all jquery-ui-<version>.custom.zip have that behaviour.. all jquery-ui-<version>.zip dont
[12:10:04] <rxaviers> The .custom. are being built with `grunt build-packages` (formerly `grunt build`)
[12:10:28] <rxaviers> I dont know where's the non-custom one being built at, I think at jqueryUi grunt task.
[12:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/blob/master/grunt.js#L230
[12:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> Which actually changed in more ways with 1.10.2.
[12:12:20] <scott_gonzalez> We run `grunt build-download create-quickdownload` when doing a release.
[12:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> And now that results in an error because the download is generated twice.
[12:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> And the second time it fails with a message saying the file already exists.
[12:17:38] <rxaviers> alright, I'll make sure we get this fixed in the grunt cleanup
[12:18:02] <rxaviers> a quick fix would be to link the not-custom .zip file in the db page
[12:18:38] <rxaviers> I mean http://jqueryui.com/resources/download/jquery-ui-1.10.2.zip
[12:21:57] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, shall I? ^
[12:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, so nothing changed.
[12:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> It's just the link from the download page.
[12:23:29] <rxaviers> yeap
[12:23:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, let's change that link.
[12:23:31] <rxaviers> :)
[12:23:34] <rxaviers> ok
[12:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> That makes a lot more sense.
[12:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't figure out how this change occurred.
[12:23:53] <rxaviers> and in the sequense, I will get that fixed in the grunt too
[12:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> Makes a lot more sense that it didn't occur :-P
[12:24:00] <rxaviers> :D
[12:24:04] <rxaviers> certainly
[12:25:19] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I think we should reconsider dialog._moveToTop
[12:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I'm getting that feeling too.
[12:25:36] <scott_gonzalez> Browsers suck.
[12:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> Seriously.
[12:25:51] <mikesherov> managing zIndex ourselves sucks, but IFRAMEs and flash and applets, oh my
[12:26:00] <scott_gonzalez> But it's even worse than that.
[12:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> <video> fails too, right?
[12:26:12] <mikesherov> yeah
[12:26:13] <scott_gonzalez> And scroll is reset.
[12:26:17] <mikesherov> anything interactive
[12:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> It's dumb.
[12:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> Browsers should handle this better.
[12:26:34] <scott_gonzalez> Closing as "too hard" is crap.
[12:26:48] <mikesherov> browsers should handle "move a node" differently
[12:27:04] <mikesherov> they manage it currently as "remove node", "add node in new spot"
[12:27:09] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:27:28] <mikesherov> but until that glorious day, we gotta zIndex ourselves
[12:27:38] <mikesherov> have fun writing the unit test for that
[12:27:41] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[12:28:16] <mikesherov> I can write one for scroll reset
[12:28:30] <mikesherov> but for video and flash and iframes?
[12:28:55] <mikesherov> anyway, what was the bug with zIndex management that caused us to use a new strategy?
[12:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> We just didn't want to deal with z-index in script ever again.
[12:30:04] <mikesherov> oh, so it was just complexity
[12:30:29] <mikesherov> worthy of a 1.10.3 release?
[12:30:40] <mikesherov> or should we just wait till 1.11 for now
[12:31:29] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe 1.10.3.
[12:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> One problem is that the dialog code can't be dialog-specific.
[12:32:17] <scott_gonzalez> .ui-front is a generic solution that's implemented across many widgets.
[12:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> Dialog is the only widgets that exhibits this bug though.
[12:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> Because they re-stack on focus.
[12:33:37] <mikesherov> right
[12:34:12] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, why  are we doing installing and updating twice again (I think I forget)? https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L228
[12:34:57] <rxaviers> s/doing//g
[12:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Because `npm install` won't update installed versions with a range.
[12:36:29] <scott_gonzalez> But we should just not be using ranges.
[12:36:46] <rxaviers> that makes it easier
[12:36:53] <rxaviers> I think we only have one stuff using range
[12:37:08] <rxaviers> 		"dateformat": "1.0.2-1.2.3",
[12:37:26] <scott_gonzalez> Where is that?
[12:37:27] <rxaviers> I suppose we're safe using the latest, are we?
[12:37:40] <rxaviers> nevermind, that above is in DB
[12:37:44] <rxaviers> we're talking about jqueryUI
[12:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> And api.jqueryui.com only has a range on grunt, which is honestly fine since 0.3.x likely won't change.
[12:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> So you can drop the updates if you want.
[12:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Bumping that to blocker and making it a catch-all for these issues.
[12:43:11] <mikesherov> cool, link?
[12:44:41] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9166
[12:44:59] <rxaviers> by the way, the range I showed above is not even a range. But, a specific (weird) version.
[12:45:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ah yeah, heh
[12:45:36] <scott_gonzalez> The 1.2.3 is a build number.
[12:45:46] <rxaviers> hehh
[12:45:48] <rxaviers> yeap
[12:51:05] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, still in the previous case... We were using the update/install, so a range version got to the top of its range, right? But, if package says it works with the bottom of the range, why would we bother getting it up-to-date within its range. We could simple leave it alone. It should worl.
[12:51:07] <rxaviers> work*
[12:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> Probably because 1) the listed range was incorrect or 2) we were linking directly to a GH repo without a version.
[12:52:48] <rxaviers> ok. So, if (1) the listed range was incorrect, it should be fixed in that repo.
[12:52:56] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:53:08] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember when we did this.
[12:53:08] <rxaviers> I think we dont have (2) case anymore. yay we're good. great
[12:53:14] <scott_gonzalez> But I've always been against using ranges :-P
[12:53:19] <rxaviers> :)
[12:53:23] <rxaviers> cool just wanted to double check
[12:53:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I can't think of a case when this should've been a correct fix, unless it was case #2.
[12:53:57] <scott_gonzalez> For something like the zip modules.
[12:54:06] <scott_gonzalez> Or the logger before it was on npm.
[12:54:26] <rxaviers> right
[12:56:10] <rxaviers> Im getting another error: after npm installing ui 1.10.2, it fails npm installing 1.9, because of some grunt-contribs are in a higher version than specified
[12:56:20] <rxaviers> `grunt prune` does not clean them
[12:56:29] <scott_gonzalez> `npm prune`
[12:56:38] <rxaviers> oops
[12:56:48] <rxaviers> npm prune I meant
[12:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:58:04] <rxaviers> What I did
[12:58:12] <scott_gonzalez> and `npm install` doesn't install the correct version?
[12:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> It should see that the installed version isn't valid and install the version listed in package.json.
[12:59:13] <rxaviers> I've created a empty dir and copied a stub packages.json with
[12:59:21] <rxaviers> "dependencies": {
[12:59:21] <rxaviers> ‚ûú   ‚ûú   "grunt-contrib-uglify": "0.2.x"
[12:59:21] <rxaviers> ‚ûú   }
[12:59:55] <rxaviers> `npm install` installed 0.2.0
[13:00:56] <rxaviers> changing it to 0.1.x, made it install 0.1.2 (ah! it worked) Let me check this better
[13:08:47] <rxaviers> So, the issue actually was: after installing 1.10.2 we have some packages that are extraneous when getting back to 1.9.2. Running `npm install` fails because the extraneous packages are not satisfied with the older packages defined on 1.9.2. Although, `npm prune` here solves it.
[13:08:48] <rxaviers> https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5190379
[13:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so you need to prune before you install.
