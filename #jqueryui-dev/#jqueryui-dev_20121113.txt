[05:18:39] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: so did UI look good with 1.8.3?
[05:29:42] <Timz> Hi, I want to use the jquery-ui addClass/toggleClass extensions only. When I download only the effects core, it doesn't work. When I download the core + effects core it doesn't work neither. What part of jquery-ui is needed to make the addClass/toggleClass extensions work?
[05:57:31] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Are you thinking of the old docs? http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion#events
[05:57:58] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yeah, that's what I was asking mikesherov about. That happens simply from calling $( this ).height().
[05:58:20] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, that came out a few weeks ago.
[05:58:33] <DaveMethvin> it changes overflow??
[05:58:38] <scott_gonzalez> apparently
[05:58:45] <DaveMethvin> oh well
[05:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> At least, I tracked it down to this line: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.accordion.js#L349
[05:59:18] <scott_gonzalez> And making that line do nothing but $( this ).height() caused the bug.
[05:59:25] <scott_gonzalez> But $( this ).height( "" ) did not.
[05:59:36] <DaveMethvin> well at least we ruled out Math.max :D
[05:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:00:12] <DaveMethvin> very strange
[06:00:23] <DaveMethvin> okay well i pulled the trigger anyway
[06:00:34] <DaveMethvin> so we may need a 1.8.4 if it's something serious
[06:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well that makes it easier to test :-P
[06:00:53] <DaveMethvin> do you want the css content width there?
[06:01:03] <DaveMethvin> height
[06:01:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that it matters. All panels should have the same styles applied.
[06:01:53] <scott_gonzalez> I just want each panel to be exactly the same height.
[06:02:05] <DaveMethvin> and there's no way it should be messing with the overflow and NOT putting it back
[06:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing I can think of.
[06:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> The only place overflow is set is line 344, which a) doesn't get run in that test and b) sets the value to something different than what it's failing with.

[08:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer mikesherov: 1-9-stable is now up-to-date, so fixes in master should get cherry-picked to 1-9-stable. I didn't pull in any interaction changes though, so those should just stay in master.
[08:22:01] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: alright, good to know
[08:27:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin: what was the plan/idea to replace triggerHandler("remove") to make that faster? I think there was something.
[08:28:22] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12213#comment:2
[08:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> It wasn't about speed.
[08:28:51] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it depends on what part of the various discussions you're on, whether speed is an issue.
[08:29:12] <scott_gonzalez> There's nobody complaining today that our custom remove code is slow.
[08:33:20] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[08:33:32] <jzaefferer> forwarded to the guy next to me complaining about speed :-)
[08:37:02] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: how many commits/bug fixes landed in 1-9-stable?
[08:37:10] <jzaefferer> or, when should 1.9.2 go out?

[08:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> It's going out in a few weeks.
[08:47:55] <jzaefferer> it looks like I'll be missing meetings tomorrow, again :/
[08:48:55] <jzaefferer> made too little progress on dialog since the last one, should change Thursday and Friday. At least lots of site stuff is resolved.

[12:27:44] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Oh! Now I get what you said yesterday about widget event!
[12:36:15] <_zoggy_> http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57549150/microsoft-releases-ie-10-browser-for-windows-7/
[12:36:41] <_zoggy_> dunno if its on browser shots yet and if ie10 on win7 is really the same as on win8
[12:40:23] <_zoggy_> http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/ie-10-release-preview
[12:41:11] <DaveMethvin> _zoggy_: supposedly, Win7/IE10 is still prerelease and Win8/IE10 is released; not sure what still remains to be done on Win7 or how it affects the way the browser works
[12:41:52] <_zoggy_> yeah, but curious if its going to be one of those things where the win7 version is gimped.. like no touch support or restricted apis or something
[12:42:16] <_zoggy_> thus you wouldnt be able to assume that something is ie10 safe but only ie10 on win8 safe.. etc
[12:42:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i suspect there won't be touch support on Win7
[12:42:59] <DaveMethvin> and there's a later directx for win8 that ie10 probably uses
[12:43:18] <DaveMethvin> i have to assume that there is SOME reason why it will take another month or two to get IE10 ported back to Win7
[12:44:37] <DaveMethvin> _zoggy_: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj819730.aspx
[12:44:45] <DaveMethvin> yep, no touch support
[12:45:07] <_zoggy_> well that sucks
[12:45:22] <DaveMethvin> most hardware doesn't have touch support in win7 tho
[12:45:54] <_zoggy_> good link, will have to bookmark
[12:45:58] <DaveMethvin> so they'd be catering to the set of people who want to buy win8 systems and reformat with win7 :D
[12:46:11] <_zoggy_> i have a hp touchsmart tm2t tablet with win7 and win8 on it for testing with
[12:46:29] <DaveMethvin> i've been looking at win8 notebooks with touch screens
[12:46:32] <DaveMethvin> there are some nice ones
[12:46:45] <DaveMethvin> but i think i'll wait a few more months
[12:46:57] <_zoggy_> http://computershopper.com/laptops/reviews/hp-touchsmart-tm2t
[12:47:44] <_zoggy_> what i have, got it a few years ago.. works okay for what it is. deff not a slate tablet or something you wanna take on trips
[12:48:23] <DaveMethvin> i really want a big screen, there are a lot of 13 inch models but not a lot of 14 or 15
[12:48:26] <DaveMethvin> http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/30/hp-spectre-xt-touchsmart-ultrabook-envy-touchsmart-ultrabook-4/
[12:48:35] <_zoggy_> personally i still want a modbook
[12:49:58] <_zoggy_> so thats just capacitive ?
[12:50:21] <_zoggy_> reason i got the one i did was because it does both capacitive and resistive (wacom)
[12:50:36] <_zoggy_> nice to be able to doodle/write stuff on it
[12:51:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i don't think any have that yet

[13:14:20] <doesallmagic> info: Selectmenu tests: lint fixes
[13:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Because containment isn't core to how dragging works.
[13:15:02] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: okay thought so just checking... gonna be moving that elsewhere later?
[13:15:37] <scott_gonzalez> not sure
[13:24:00] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: okay now for the more complicated, unrelated question. start happens when first interacting with an element whether its mousedown or touch or something of that nature right?
[13:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:24:54] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: in the context of sortable, the element i call on is the list itself so what's the best way to get to the specific list item that user is trying to drag for example... i think we'd want to avoid any $(this).on('drag', 'li')
[13:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> Use _isValidTarget().
[13:27:16] <Dave_Stein> okay so in that function for sortable ill make it return true if its an li within the list then? thats the gist?
[13:27:34] <Dave_Stein> i saw you had that in draggable, using handle obviously instead
[13:27:36] <Dave_Stein> makes sense
[13:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but it'd be based on options.items, right?

[13:32:04] <Dave_Stein> thought that might be your answer which is why i wasnt thinknig of options yet.. just a basic sort will be safe enough for me to do without an api
[13:32:15] <Dave_Stein> i know mike is eager for the API for the tests ha

[15:15:18] <mikesherov> hi
[15:15:29] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[15:15:59] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: yt?
[15:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> hey mikesherov
[15:16:15] <mikesherov> hey scott_gonzalez sorry I've been AFK since yesterday
[15:16:26] <mikesherov> Very busy with some personal stuff
[15:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> Did you get power back?
[15:16:38] <mikesherov> saw you were writing about .height()?
[15:16:57] <mikesherov> yeah, power is back, internet is back, just some other personal stuff
[15:17:09] <mikesherov> thanks for asking :-)
[15:17:22] <mikesherov> anyway, what was the deal with .height()?
[15:17:30] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: hello
[15:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> This failure: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/449233
[15:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> Where the overflow changes from visible to scroll.
[15:18:13] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: where are you based out of? and I'm working on the most minimal sortable stuff right now
[15:18:25] <mikesherov> I'm in Long Island
[15:18:26] <scott_gonzalez> Is caused by this line: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.accordion.js#L349
[15:18:28] <mikesherov> work out of NYC
[15:18:41] <mikesherov> interesting!
[15:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically the .height().
[15:19:22] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: My friends office is still without power I think in Nassau - I'm in NYC
[15:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Seeing your Verizon hotspot at the summit got me thinking about getting one.
[15:19:34] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you should
[15:19:40] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: we should meet up!
[15:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> Then today our cable company disconnected our service, even though we told them to do it on the 22nd.
[15:19:49] <mikesherov> We have plenty of jQuery guys in the city now
[15:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> So I went out and bought a jetpack today.
[15:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> Which I'm now using because Time Warner is full of idiots.
[15:20:09] <mikesherov> meh
[15:20:12] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: Yeah I've only met ajpiano so far.. and well resig if he still counts :P
[15:20:33] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so, what's the intent there? .height("") doesn't really make sense
[15:20:36] <Dave_Stein> Verizon is the best cable service I've ever had for internet and tv
[15:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Sure, that should probably be .css( "height", "" )
[15:20:57] <Dave_Stein> Not that I know what you're talking about but I'd think .height('') would remove any height part of style... justl ike what scott just wrote
[15:21:03] <Dave_Stein> :)
[15:21:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to find out how tall each panel is when a height isn't forced.
[15:21:11] <mikesherov> right, but that's changed in 1.8
[15:21:28] <Dave_Stein> .css( 'height', '') still works in 1.8
[15:21:28] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: do you want content height?
[15:21:41] <scott_gonzalez> Well, in this specific case it doesn't matter.
[15:21:44] <mikesherov> .css('height') and .height() are semantically different now
[15:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> All panels should have the same styles and box sizing.
[15:22:01] <scott_gonzalez> So it doesn't matter if I get content height or not.
[15:22:02] <mikesherov> .css('height') is the literally "height:" css attribute
[15:22:11] <mikesherov> .height() is content height
[15:22:28] <mikesherov> content height differs from the height property when the box model is border-box
[15:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> right
[15:22:44] <mikesherov> I was exlpaining to Dave_Stein
[15:22:55] <Dave_Stein> ah gotcha makes sense
[15:22:58] <mikesherov> So, the real question, is wtf does that change overflow
[15:23:15] <mikesherov> I can imagine the "" is interpeted as zero
[15:23:45] <mikesherov> so then that triggers the hidden nonsense?
[15:25:13] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ?
[15:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the interesting this is that this fails only in >=1.6 <1.8
[15:25:30] <mikesherov> ONLY?
[15:25:31] <scott_gonzalez> So it passes in 1.8 with the conten height changes :-P
[15:25:42] <mikesherov> meaning, started working in 1.8?
[15:25:45] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[15:25:53] <mikesherov> and only in IE7
[15:26:05] <scott_gonzalez> The failure just started showing up because I added style checks to domEqual().
[15:26:06] <mikesherov> which has no box-sizing support
[15:26:20] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: style checks are good :-)
[15:27:56] <mikesherov> so, I can say that I did a lot of things to fix css and dimensions in 1.8
[15:28:29] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: But I don't remember anything that has to do with overflow‚Ä¶
[15:30:38] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Is .height( "" ) a legit thing to continue doing or should I change that to .css( "height", "" ) ?
[15:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> Also, if nothing is standing out to you, I can just bisect this.
[15:31:09] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you should use .css('height', ''); to remove styles
[15:31:14] <mikesherov> bisect it
[15:31:53] <scott_gonzalez> The amount of bisecting I've done this month is rivaling all of bisecting I've done prior to this month.
[15:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully this doesn't bring me to a massive branch merge commit.
[15:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> I've had that happen when bisecting against the 1.8 release.
[15:32:47] <mikesherov> or to before 1.8!
[15:32:56] <mikesherov> at least you can always use make
[15:33:15] <mikesherov> it's the crap that's like bisected between the grunt/make switch that is annoying
[15:34:37] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: .height() should only be used when you actually need content height
[15:35:21] <mikesherov> which is why I originally wanted to keep the semantics of .height() unchanges and introduce .contentHeight()
[15:35:24] <mikesherov> but that was shut down
[15:36:20] <mikesherov> instead of bisecting for morbid curiousity, try the .css('height') stuff first please
[15:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> I did, it was still failing, but I'll double check just to be sure.
[15:40:58] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I'm wondering why this is passing now. Forgot that I disabled the style checks until we fixed this :-P
[15:41:12] <scott_gonzalez> Style checks are SLOW in oldIE.
[15:49:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, using .css( "height" ) still has the failure.
