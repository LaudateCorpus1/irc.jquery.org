[00:54:03] <_|Nix|_> Have I mentioned my hate of heisenbugs yet?

[01:53:47] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ping!
[01:57:24] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I'm no stranger to keyword "default" being declared.... we were debugging a small application and the data passed included excessive use of "default" (in this case as JSON property). Only when we changed all to "default_value", things started to work (on IOS I believe). Maybe helpful.
[01:58:56] <frequent> _|Nix|_: strangely I never got an error message. App just did not load.
[02:00:10] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Same thing happens with jQM right now. It simply dies during initialization, because of a syntax error.
[02:00:50] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... IE8, Android 2.3.5, and Safari 5 are effectively c-grade :/
[02:02:08] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hm. not nice.
[02:03:20] <frequent> _|Nix|_: my other error never popping up is quoting object keys. So { foo: "bar"} silently failed some devices we tested, while {"foo": "bar"} worked.
[02:11:16] <_|Nix|_> frequent: That's incredible. I mean, I understand that failing when the key is a reserved word, but when it's something arbitrary ...
[02:11:28] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Did any unquoted key fail on those devices?
[02:14:42] <frequent> _|Nix|_: It was some months ago, but I remember only after replacing defaults and quoting all keys the app started correctly. Let me check with me colleague ...
[02:15:42] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Insane ... wow!
[03:24:08] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi closed issue #7156: JQM 1.4.1 and Android2 Incompatability 02http://git.io/FQUGvw
[03:43:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The problem with the flaky test may be a problem in core. It seems that the delegated event handler sometimes doesn't get called.
[03:44:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We shouldn't be using a delegated event handler to prevent propagation, mind you, but it should work consistently - i.e., it should either never work, or always work.
[03:47:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: does it only happen with latest stable version of core?
[03:47:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. It happens randomly across all versions with which we test.
[03:47:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But I haven't been looking closely.
[03:48:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: since this wasn't an issue before, something must have changed somewhere
[03:48:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: either in core or in our library/tests
[03:48:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suspect it was an issue before, but the issue with the other flaky test (the dialog) was distracting us.
[03:49:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll re-run the build at https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/19482345 several times, and I'll check on which versions it's happening.
[03:49:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if it is a problem in core I wouldn't expect it to happen with older versions like 1.8.x that didn't change
[03:49:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, that's true.
[03:49:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The thing is, the delegated handler doesn't fire, but the non-delegated handler does fire.
[03:49:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's ask arschmitz and gseguin|away if they noticed it before
[03:49:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: .
[03:50:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That was supposed to be "OK." :)
[03:50:15] <uGoMobi> ok :)
[03:50:38] <_|Nix|_> I'll re-run that build a few times and record when and where it fails.
[03:51:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can also test this with the 1.3-stable branch
[03:51:26] <uGoMobi> to see if the problem occurs
[03:56:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good point!
[03:56:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: A really, really expensive git bisect :)

[12:40:35] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/19497349 completed successfully, yet it is marked as failed, and so is the whole build :/
[12:58:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i see it with 2 failures
[13:01:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, no ... the job ID doesn't change when you restart it.
[13:01:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NM then.
[13:02:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It was weird. It completed successfully, but it was marked as failed.
[13:02:46] <arschmitz> it was probably a mixing of states if you are restarting them
[13:02:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[13:03:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it was still showing failed from previous run
[13:03:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I keep re-running two jobs - one from 1.3-stable (1447), and one from master(1448), to see which one fails on the page unit tests.
[13:03:30] <arschmitz> probably just looked at the wrong time and caught them in the middle of propagating the results
[13:03:37] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[13:03:47] <_|Nix|_> Sorry, I meant two builds, not two jobs.
[13:04:09] <_|Nix|_> ... but it's like pulling teeth. travis is super-busy.
[13:04:18] <_|Nix|_> Maybe I should try it when North America is sleeping.
[13:04:29] <arschmitz> probably a lot faster
[13:05:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. Anyway, that failure is really weird. We have a delegated event listener which stops propagation on the event. Sometimes it gets called, sometimes it does not.
[13:05:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right now, I'm trying to do a sort of git bisect to see where the problem was introduced.
[13:05:58] <arschmitz> is it a core bug or something we are doing?
[13:06:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, that's a good question.
[13:06:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: On the face of it, it looks like a core bug, however, I'm not sure when it reared its ugly head, because we were busy with other things.
[13:07:02] <arschmitz> ok
[13:07:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's why I'd like to replace the jqueries used in the master build and add console.logs to the ones being used.
[13:07:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd like to add a console log right before the decision whether the delegated handler should be run or not.
[13:08:03] <arschmitz> on master?
[13:08:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes.
[13:08:16] <arschmitz> why on master why wouldnt you use a branch?
[13:08:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course it's a branch. When I say master, I mean a branch off master, rather than a branch off 1.3-stable.
[13:08:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry for the misunderstanding.
[13:08:49] <arschmitz> oh ok
[13:09:04] <arschmitz> i was gonna say master should not be used for debugging
[13:09:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, of course not. That's super-clear to me.
[13:09:35] <arschmitz> i figured but i thought thats what you were saying
[13:09:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and it's easy enough to add branches to travis.
[13:10:26] <_|Nix|_> Holy, shitsu! I'm still waiting on one of the jobs ... it's been, like, 45 minutes ... ffffffffuuuuuuu >:(
