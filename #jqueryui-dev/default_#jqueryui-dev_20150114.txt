[04:40:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping! Looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7831 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/page.js#L119-L126 I'd say we could if ( this._trigger( "remove" ) ) { this.element.removeWithDependents(); } and in pagecontainer we could this._on( page, { "pageremove", function() { this._trigger( "remove" ); }}); to trigger pagecontainerremove ... what say you?

[10:58:57] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license, Does "to ensure that all commits have appropriate licensing" work by listing all commits of a repo and checking the licensing commit per commit?
[11:03:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, when doing a branch audit.
[11:03:36] <scott_gonzalez> For a PR, it just checks the commits in the PR.
[11:09:49] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, that's where I wanted to get into.. How do you check the commits in the PR only? I assume you git log <committish>
[11:09:54] <rxaviers> What do you use?
[11:10:11] <scott_gonzalez> I use the data from the web hook.
[11:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> It's not available through Travis.
[11:10:29] <scott_gonzalez> But you could get the data with the GitHub API if you wanted in Travis.
[11:10:33] <scott_gonzalez> It's just a lot less efficient.
[11:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, you could do it in a single API call.
[11:12:00] <rxaviers> Ah, I see. When you notice that a PR has invalid licenses, how are repo owners acknowledged? Or what's the workflow?
[11:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> And then get the log locally based on the base and head of hte PR.
[11:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> It sets the commit status, which doesn't send any notificaiton, but does mark the PR as a failure, just like Travis.
[11:12:42] <rxaviers> Ah!
[11:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> The plan is to have it also set a label, which will trigger a notification.
[11:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> And also make it easier to notice that it failed the CLA check specifically.
[11:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be working on that this week and/or next week.
[11:13:33] <scott_gonzalez> So hopefully we'll have the PR service up and running on our repos soon.
[11:13:40] <rxaviers> Do you think commitplease could behave similarly?
[11:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> It can, if someone stood up a service for it.
[11:14:33] <rxaviers> I've implemented a grunt-commitplease, but I could rewrite it using your approach instead.
[11:14:50] <rxaviers> I think we can set various statuses on a commit, right?
[11:14:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, you can have multiple statuses on a commit.
[11:15:01] <rxaviers> license checking, commitplease, etc.
[11:15:10] <rxaviers> awesome. What do you think overall?
[11:15:21] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we need a service for commitplease.
[11:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> Honestly, if someone sends a PR with a bad format becauase they didn't install the dependencies, it's easy to fix when you're merging.
[11:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> Especially if you're rebasing because the rebase will fail to commit for the maintainer.
[11:17:26] <rxaviers> alright
[11:23:53] <arschmitz> rxaviers: honestly i only use commit please in jquery pr because when i wrote it comitplease was not actually on the repos yet
[11:24:23] <arschmitz> not to check for people that worked around ti some how
[11:29:38] <rxaviers> ok
[12:08:25] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: is there an IRC for PEP, or do we ask questions here?
[12:08:35] <arthurvr> #pep
[12:08:39] <jperrault> thx
