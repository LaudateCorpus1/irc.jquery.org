[05:04:05] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I did another round of button review, including the two branches; I think there's some obvious issues that you could address, I can do another review round then. Until next Wednesday would be good.
[05:34:24] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, just to emphasize, I've reviewed and tested DB. It's ready to support 1.11.1

[09:14:03] <Pritchard> I've noticed jQuery UI's autocomplete widget doesn't support an option for "additional data to post to server".
[09:14:31] <Pritchard> https://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-1-9-git.js
[09:14:43] <Pritchard> Search browser for _search: and all it supports is posting the term.
[09:15:40] <Pritchard> Being able to post additional data along with the search term is something I'd put on my wishlist.

[09:46:39] <jzaefferer> Pritchard: you can also provide a function to do the request yourself, for example http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp - generally, you'll get answers in #jquery
[09:47:17] <Pritchard> jzaefferer:  Thanks!
