[09:03:55] <danheberden> can someone go to jqueryui.com in an incognito window and check the demo page and download ui?
[09:14:19] <jzaefferer> kborchers: looks like datepicker fails on the 29th? http://bassistance.de/i/f8bcb7.png
[09:15:09] <kborchers> uh oh, yeah that's probably what it was.
[09:15:10] <rworth> danheberden: worksforme
[09:15:14] <kborchers> i was seeing other errors though

[09:18:23] <kborchers> then a refresh gives this http://gyazo.com/0e174acf1c5a815f3e2d290017f24615 in addition to the other errors
[09:18:30] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ^
[09:23:03] <zwick> I got it to build if I commented out that for loop that I pasted in above.
[09:23:18] <zwick> Not at all the ideal fix, but at least I can test my code
[09:32:29] <gnarf> hey btw kborchers - theBrettman was asking some questions about menu's status / needs last night - not sure if he's lurking now or not - but just a heads up
[10:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: jquery.org/updates is really slow to update
[10:38:04] <scott_gonzalez> I got the confirmation about the post a while ago, but the site still isn't updated
[10:38:15] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez i'm updating in wp-admin - i'll push yours live
[10:38:52] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[10:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/29/apple_multitouch_patent/
[10:45:25] <danheberden> patents will be the end of us

[10:46:30] <tbranyen> or the end of us taking patents seriously
[10:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> "Apologies, but we were unable to find what you were looking for. Perhaps searching will help."
[10:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Doesn't seem to be there for me.
[10:47:31] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez weird

[10:49:11] <danheberden> so now that the wordpress update has faild
[10:49:29] <danheberden> i get yet another problem to fix
[11:01:55] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez - somehow it was scheduled for when you posted it, which ended up being three hours ahead :/
[11:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:02:08] <scott_gonzalez> I can see it now.
[11:02:08] <danheberden> http://jquery.org/updates/2012/02/29/ui-status-update-28/
[11:02:09] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[11:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> While you're in there...
[11:03:11] <scott_gonzalez> There's a file with a bad HTML comment in it.
[11:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> The comments div is commented out.
[11:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> But there's a comment in the commented out code.
[11:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> Check out the bottom of that post.
[11:04:03] <scott_gonzalez> You'll see -->
[11:11:57] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez fixed
[11:12:20] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...does it take a while to update?
[11:12:26] <danheberden> yeah, cached
[11:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[17:47:15] <theBrettman> something up with the icon styles on the button demo page. change the them and see the button icons don't change with it...
[18:04:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ping
[18:04:37] <scott_gonzalez> pong
[18:04:42] <kborchers> damn leap year
[18:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[18:05:11] <kborchers> should i still be seeing failing datepicker tests?
[18:05:58] <kborchers> saw jzaefferer's commit earlier and assumed it was for that but didn't actually look
[18:06:08] <kborchers> i just looked and i guess he wasn't fixing that
[18:06:18] <scott_gonzalez> He was fixing something else.
[18:06:45] <kborchers> ok, i guess i'll ignore those so i can keep working on $.browser stuff
[18:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> This probably sounds bad, but if we ignore the failing tests, they'll go away :-P
[18:07:19] <kborchers> we can worry about it again in 4 years :D
[18:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah. Though we should have the new datepicker by then.
[18:07:43] * scott_gonzalez crosses fingers
[18:07:56] <kborchers> the key word there is "should" :P
[18:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> It's rendering 29 days for the month, so I'm not really concerned.
[18:08:16] <kborchers> yep
[18:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably a bug in the actual test.
[18:08:39] <kborchers> yeah, that's what i was thinking, just haven't looked
[18:09:21] <kborchers> so i was thinking any $.browser's i can get rid of, i'll do it, commit it and then send a PR with all of the commits
[18:09:38] <kborchers> any i don't know if we can kill or i'm not sure how, i'll list in the ticket
[18:10:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: work for you? ^
[18:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> worksforme
[18:10:46] <kborchers> cool
[18:11:04] <kborchers> already got rid of one ... for Opera 9 support :)
[18:15:09] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[18:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> whoa, Chrome's console has awesome output for arrays now.
[18:31:03] <scott_gonzalez> Run `new Array( 100 )`
[18:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> Results: [undefined × 100]
[18:32:00] <scott_gonzalez> heh: [undefined × 50, "hi", undefined × 49]
[18:34:25] <kborchers> nice!
[18:35:37] <kborchers> i am so confused right now. with no changes, i am seeing dialog failures in IE9
[18:35:45] <kborchers> WTF fractional max height!!
[18:36:29] <kborchers> fractions everywhere!
[18:44:20] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'm confused
[18:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[18:44:43] <kborchers> i look at this http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/dialog/dialog.html in IE9 and get a bunch of failures
[18:45:03] <kborchers> i look at this http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/ and it says dialog has been good for a while
[18:45:08] <kborchers> WTF?!?!?!?
[18:46:15] <kborchers> and the failures are things like maxHeight expected to be 200 and it get 199.600000000000002
[18:46:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, don't worry about those.
[18:46:40] <scott_gonzalez> Dialog tests are disabled in TestSwarm :-P
[18:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> It shows up as passing because it's 1 test that says ok( true );
[18:46:59] <kborchers> skdjfgljnadsfgha;odngfa!!!!!
[18:47:14] <kborchers> ok, just needed to get that out
[18:47:19] <kborchers> thought i was going crazy
[18:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, and new IE supports fractional pixels
[18:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> HOORAY
[18:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> I wanted to stab myself in the eye when MS told me they were adding it.
[18:48:12] * kborchers barfs
[18:48:29] <scott_gonzalez> It gets better.
[18:48:48] <scott_gonzalez> Subpixels are coming to WebKit: https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/LayoutUnit
[18:48:48] * kborchers cries thinking about Position
[18:49:17] <kborchers> great
[18:49:32] <kborchers> is it too late to become a lumber jack?
[18:49:32] <scott_gonzalez> Now we can be broken in all browsers!
[18:49:44] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. I've been practicing in my yard!
[18:49:54] <scott_gonzalez> Got a chainsaw and climbing gear.
[18:50:02] <kborchers> nice!
[18:50:04] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully getting some climbing spikes soon too :-P
[18:50:13] <kborchers> do you hate trees?
[18:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> I do.
[18:50:21] <kborchers> didn't you have some stump issues a while back?
[18:50:23] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately Kristin does not.
[18:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah. That stump was a pain.
[18:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> I've ground out two stumps myself.
[18:51:11] <kborchers> i like trees ... until i mow my lawn
[18:51:13] <scott_gonzalez> I actually dug another one out (that's the one your'e thinking of).
[18:51:27] <scott_gonzalez> And we've had a few more done by professionals.
[18:51:39] <kborchers> isn't that what dynamite is for? :P
[18:51:50] <scott_gonzalez> I like trees until they're every two feet and a million feet tall and dumping leaves and pine needles all over the place.
[18:52:18] <scott_gonzalez> I take my leaf blower on to my roof to clean my gutters :-)
[18:52:46] <scott_gonzalez> It works well. And if the gutters get clogged, the pressure washer can take care of it...
[18:52:53] <kborchers> mine are every two feet and 10 feet tall with branches that hang down by the ground so when you mow it like walking through a dojo during karate class
[18:53:03] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:53:24] <kborchers> every direction i turn i get smacked in the face
[18:54:07] <kborchers> my goal is to keep hitting the trunks with the mower until they are so damaged that the tree dies, then Melissa will have to let me get rid of it :)
[18:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> heh

[19:16:36] * theBrettman wonders how much farther the world would be in development if developers would've forced users to download something other than IE a long time ago
[19:16:59] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you guys aren't making it very easy to test removal of $.browser stuff with all of these changes to the tests :P
[19:17:13] <kborchers> tests are really broken now
[19:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> really broken?
[19:18:16] <theBrettman> Hi, I'm theBrettman and I want to get involved...
[19:18:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: looks like they might be fixing themselves ... damn browserstack
[19:19:04] <kborchers> FF 3.6 isn't though
[19:19:07] <kborchers> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/942/
[19:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> ERROR: null has invalid __iterator__ value null
[19:19:39] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds bad :-P
[19:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> Might be a bug in the QUnit changes.
[19:19:58] <kborchers> sounds nully
[19:20:28] <kborchers> i'm guessing that's what it is
[19:21:08] <kborchers> when i run the tests in browserstack with IE8 .... lots of failures. not sure what's up
[19:21:14] <theBrettman> can anyone point me to where to start?
[19:23:09] <kborchers> theBrettman: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/35263114/Getting%20Involved  http://jqueryui.com/development
[19:27:43] <theBrettman> I don't understand why the menu.js on git isn't the same as the one in the demo at jqueryui.com?
[19:29:03] <kborchers> theBrettman: what menu demo are you referring to? menu has not been released yet and is not on jqueryui.com
[19:29:18] <theBrettman> the one at jqueryui.com/master
[19:29:37] <theBrettman> not the same 1.9m2 on git
[19:29:49] <theBrettman> by a few hundred lines of code
[19:30:30] <kborchers> ?
[19:30:38] <kborchers> what is jqueryui.com/master ?
[19:30:38] <theBrettman> let me give links instead
[19:30:43] <kborchers> thanks
[19:31:12] <theBrettman> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js is not the same as https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1.9m2/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js
[19:31:50] <kborchers> the first version is what is in master, that is the most up to date
[19:32:07] <kborchers> the second is 1.9M2 which is old
[19:32:08] <theBrettman> where's master on git?
[19:32:33] <kborchers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[19:32:51] <kborchers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js
[19:33:57] <theBrettman> (facepalm)
[19:35:04] <theBrettman> not sure how I ended up in that milestone folder, ohwell
[19:54:27] <theBrettman> so currently, the best way to do commands for a contextmenu would be a switch statement under select:?
[23:04:30] <theBrettman> contextmenu demo missing :(
