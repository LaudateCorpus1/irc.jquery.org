[05:44:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm I have to give that a closer look
[05:44:14] <uGoMobi> maybe check history 
[05:44:22] <uGoMobi> why we set certain things
[05:44:31] <uGoMobi> will do that today
[05:44:42] <uGoMobi> so we can decide to merge or not
[05:44:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok i just figured that change would be more a question for you
[05:45:22] <arschmitz> ill take care of the JS part of it

[06:21:38] <tj_vantoll> mikesherov: I'm confused by this comment because the only browser that bug does not occur in is Chrome (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9315#comment:19).
[06:28:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: re: navbar buttons; I think we have to exclude those from buttonMarkup
[06:28:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: whys thar
[06:28:55] <arschmitz> that?
[06:29:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: they are enhanced in the navbar widget
[06:30:05] <uGoMobi> and the buttonMarkup function mess them up when you add data-role="button" in your markup
[06:30:20] <uGoMobi> that's why they still get ui-corner-all
[06:30:31] <uGoMobi> because that's the default
[06:30:37] <arschmitz> right
[06:31:08] <uGoMobi> if you don't add data-role="button" it's all fine
[06:31:16] <arschmitz> so you just mean exclude in the buttonmarkup selector right?
[06:31:19] <uGoMobi> we could say we just document that
[06:31:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[06:31:51] <arschmitz> im not completely sure thats actually posiible becauce what would we use to exclude it?
[06:32:14] <uGoMobi> .ui-navbar a
[06:32:20] <arschmitz> we can use navbar classes because navbar is not enhanced yet when buttonmarkup runs
[06:32:25] <arschmitz> can't*
[06:32:34] <uGoMobi> i see
[06:32:57] <uGoMobi> then we have to document that you shouldn't add the data-role
[06:33:16] <uGoMobi> that's better for performance in all ways
[06:34:06] <uGoMobi> here you can see the difference http://jsbin.com/edeluh/59
[06:34:23] <uGoMobi> in footer they have the data-role attribute
[06:35:54] <arschmitz> oh man the way we are doing now is bad anyway
[06:36:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in navbar or in buttonMarkup?
[06:36:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: why dont we just call buttonmarkup in navbar?
[06:38:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: because we removed all calls to buttonMarkup
[06:38:34] <uGoMobi> and then we changed the buttonMarkup function
[06:38:39] <uGoMobi> to what it is now
[06:38:45] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#639 (master - 75572f6 : frequent): The build has errored.

[06:42:19] <arschmitz> hmmm ok
[06:42:50] <arschmitz> seems like that could lead to a lot more problems like this.
[06:43:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we can change it to use buttonMarkup again
[06:43:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I suppose we do same for controlgroups
[06:43:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah 
[06:43:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it's just that we didn't have time to do the navbar refactor for 1.4
[06:44:10] <arschmitz> i know i wanted to do that one too....
[06:44:26] <arschmitz> because in my own stuff i use a custom navbar i think works much better
[06:45:09] <arschmitz> because ours is terrible for responsive layouts and the more then 5 buttons just go to double stack i think is terrible
[06:45:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I agree
[06:45:44] <uGoMobi> and the code is kinda terrible too
[06:45:55] <uGoMobi> doesn't really look like a widget
[06:46:01] <arschmitz> in my own more then 5 just breaks to two lines
[06:46:07] <arschmitz> liek 6 goes 3 and 3
[06:46:15] <arschmitz> 7 goes 4 - 3 etc
[06:46:53] <uGoMobi> also saw a feaure request for make it horizontal scrollable
[06:47:00] <uGoMobi> not sure what i think of that
[06:47:06] <uGoMobi> and overflow scrolling...
[06:47:10] <arschmitz> hmmm yeah i dont think i like that
[06:47:46] <uGoMobi> anyways, we can look into this for 1.5
[06:47:59] <uGoMobi> what shall we do for 1.4?
[06:48:11] <uGoMobi> leave it as it is now?
[06:48:26] <uGoMobi> or change to use buttonMarkup?
[06:48:31] <arschmitz> hmmm....
[06:49:00] <arschmitz> let me look to double check one thing in button markup
[06:49:06] <uGoMobi> sure
[06:50:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im kinda thinking navbar should just check if buttonmarkup exists and if it does call it with options
[06:51:06] <arschmitz> ohhh we can also just exlcude in selector
[06:51:20] <arschmitz> :jqmData(role='navbar')
[06:52:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I suggest we do that for 1.4
[06:52:22] <arschmitz> works for me
[06:52:51] <uGoMobi> if we do things quick now we migth cause bugs
[06:52:58] <uGoMobi> better do it right at once for 1.5
[06:52:59] <arschmitz> yup
[06:53:03] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:55:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the CSS in that PR for textinput should be ok
[06:55:33] <arschmitz> hmmm not sure if git hub is having issues or what but its telling me coverTransitions branch does not exist when i try and pull it
[06:55:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hahaha
[06:55:58] <uGoMobi> that took me 10 mins too
[06:56:06] <uGoMobi> there is a typo in the branch name
[06:56:06] <arschmitz> ??
[06:56:15] <uGoMobi> coverTansitions
[06:56:20] <arschmitz> oh man
[06:56:44] <uGoMobi> i thought exactly the same
[06:58:38] <arschmitz> ugh im not rebasing this branch lol too many issues for that and i dont know the changes lol
[07:00:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I understand
[07:00:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I already merged master few weeks ago
[07:00:36] <uGoMobi> and resolved the conflicts
[07:00:46] <arschmitz> yeah thats what im doing right now and if i rebase i have to resolve those again
[07:00:46] <uGoMobi> but there might be new ones
[07:01:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, you don't want that because there were more than enough :/
[07:01:58] <arschmitz> yeah thats why i said im not doing it lol

[07:09:51] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6293 by arrivabeni (2d 36m ago): Panels outside Page - not rendering well
[07:10:02] <uGoMobi> here is decent test page http://jsbin.com/edeluh/70/edit
[07:10:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: isn't listview supposed to be enhanced now when in a panel outside page?
[07:10:36] <arschmitz> only if you call it
[07:10:53] <arschmitz> outside page you need to call everything your self
[07:11:01] <arschmitz> just like in ui
[07:11:15] <arschmitz> or you can use $.fn.enhanceWithin
[07:11:20] <uGoMobi> i see, I thought autoinit changed that
[07:11:32] <uGoMobi> aha, that's what I meant
[07:11:35] <arschmitz> no autoinit is part of the page widget basicly
[07:11:55] <uGoMobi> how does enhanceWithin work exactly?
[07:12:38] <arschmitz> just like any other jquery plugin basicly you call $("#something").enhanceWithin();
[07:12:49] <arschmitz> and everything inside #something will be enhanced
[07:12:58] <uGoMobi> ok clear
[07:13:06] <uGoMobi> so I just call it for body
[07:13:20] <uGoMobi> oh I see now that he did call panel plugin
[07:13:28] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[07:13:33] <arschmitz> you can but thats going to call everything inside page too
[07:13:35] <uGoMobi> I will comment and close
[07:13:43] <uGoMobi> ah right
[07:14:01] <uGoMobi> enhanceWithin for panel then
[07:14:28] <arschmitz> i would probably do $("#panelID").panel().enhanceWithin(); in that case
[07:15:41] <uGoMobi> yeah that should work

[07:34:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: have you tried cover transitions on devices at all?
[07:35:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure, I might have tested Android 4.2 and iOS 6 on iPad
[07:36:29] <arschmitz> ok
[07:40:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: a couple things i notice right off with them
[07:42:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is a white flash then all of a sudden you are back at top of page then the cover transition takes place
[07:42:56] <arschmitz> depending on speed of device this isnt bad but slow devices its kinda bad
[07:43:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm
[07:43:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and its not a bug or anything its how transitions work basicly
[07:43:53] <arschmitz> the white flash is the page scrolling to top
[07:44:28] <arschmitz> then when it shows again you are at top and it transitions
[07:44:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, but somehow you notice these things a bit more with this transition
[07:44:43] <arschmitz> on like desktop chrome or galaxy s4 its so fast your barely notice 
[07:44:50] <uGoMobi> when I tested on desktop I already found the page scroll more visible or something
[07:44:50] <arschmitz> but on my iphone 4 its kinda bad
[07:44:57] <uGoMobi> I see
[07:45:24] <arschmitz> so im just not sure
[07:45:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe we should wait with merging until 1.5
[07:46:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I still want to look into some transition things
[07:46:26] <uGoMobi> see if we can improve it a bit
[07:46:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we can but this is something that unless we completely rewirte the js transition handlers is not going to change i dont think
[07:48:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I just wanted to go thru the whole logic and see if we can do something about the flickering etc
[07:48:47] <arschmitz> yeah this isnt flickering or anything though
[07:50:30] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:50:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you think they look at least as good as other transitions we can land in 1.4
[07:51:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you think they are a bit worse then I suggest we wait
[07:52:17] <arschmitz> ill compare and decide but im leaning towards worse
[07:52:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[07:53:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will try them on iPad and Galaxy Nexus so I have an idea as well
[07:53:58] <arschmitz> sounds good
[07:59:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so my inital would say there is no doubt other transitions are much cleaner reaction is other transitions are better
[07:59:34] <arschmitz> because they keep the page hidden and dont reshow again after going to white
[08:00:05] <arschmitz> but i guess thats the entire difference between this and slide fade
[08:00:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh something else i just noticed why is there a cover right and cover left ? shouldnt it just be cover and then reverse of it for back like all other transitions?
[08:01:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the reverse version would more be reveal left/rigth
[08:01:36] <uGoMobi> so it makes sense to have both I guess
[08:01:55] <uGoMobi> just wasn't sure what should be named left and what right
[08:02:12] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:02:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think I agree with you about the quality
[08:02:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: talking about reverse
[08:02:45] <uGoMobi> when I go back, should i get a reverse cover transition?
[08:03:11] <arschmitz> hmmmm i dont know lol
[08:03:18] <uGoMobi> because something looks bad when I click "take me back"
[08:03:26] <arschmitz> i guess reveal makes sense
[08:03:36] <arschmitz> oh iv been using back button let me see if thats different
[08:04:08] <uGoMobi> I think we have reverse CSS for all our transitions
[08:04:21] <uGoMobi> but they might be missing for those two new ones
[08:04:24] <arschmitz> yes
[08:04:55] <uGoMobi> it's just a link with data-rel="back"
[08:05:01] <arschmitz> ok
[08:05:05] <uGoMobi> that triggers reverse transition
[08:05:19] <uGoMobi> but I don't think that's what I see lol
[08:05:27] <arschmitz> oh difference though is scrolling
[08:05:34] <arschmitz> need to scroll down to take me back 
[08:05:40] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:06:30] <uGoMobi> on my galaxy nexus the whole page seems broken in pieces when I go back
[08:07:11] <arschmitz> yes same here
[08:07:20] <arschmitz> ok here are my thoughts
[08:07:33] <arschmitz> its real choppy going back
[08:07:41] <uGoMobi> yeah
[08:07:47] <arschmitz> and speed makes it look kinda bad going forward too
[08:07:51] <uGoMobi> there is something wrong there
[08:08:00] <arschmitz> fast devices are good slow are weird 
[08:08:08] <arschmitz> and reverse should reveal i think
[08:08:09] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:08:14] <arschmitz> kinda like a deck of cards
[08:08:32] <arschmitz> they should stack up or slide off as you go forward or back
[08:08:45] <uGoMobi> yeah sounds good
[08:09:11] <uGoMobi> I does the same thing in reverse order now so it's not that CSS is missing or something
[08:09:24] <uGoMobi> but somehow back is way worse then forward
[08:10:02] <arschmitz> and im still not sure i get cover right i think there should only be cover
[08:10:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so we just decided not to merge now
[08:10:12] <arschmitz> and reveal when going back
[08:10:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah maybe you are right
[08:10:28] <arschmitz> because our idea of transitions in nav is direction with history
[08:10:35] <arschmitz> so a right over makes no real sense
[08:11:01] <arschmitz> so in theory i like the cover transition but i think it needs work 
[08:11:13] <uGoMobi> agreed
[08:11:19] <arschmitz> cool
[08:11:29] <uGoMobi> we had a PR for slide popup slide transition
[08:11:40] <uGoMobi> that had also to do with right and left and reverse
[08:11:52] <arschmitz> slide popup slide transition? what is that? lol
[08:12:06] <uGoMobi> like you can't make it slide it from the left now
[08:12:14] <arschmitz> oh ok
[08:12:20] <arschmitz> for popup it makes sense
[08:12:26] <uGoMobi> uhh.. popup slide transition, sorry
[08:12:36] <arschmitz> popup is not really part of history 
[08:13:00] <arschmitz> so the direction is purely ascetic 
[08:13:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what about when we support dir="rtl"
[08:13:18] <arschmitz> hmmmm
[08:13:23] <uGoMobi> does that go other direction?
[08:13:26] <uGoMobi> haha
[08:13:31] <arschmitz> id have to ask someone with more rtl experience
[08:13:47] <arschmitz> if their concept of history would be reversed as well
[08:13:58] <uGoMobi> I don't know either
[08:14:03] <arschmitz> because honestly i have no idea if the two would be related or not
[08:14:17] <uGoMobi> if front page of newspapers are at the back in the middle east etc.
[08:14:25] <arschmitz> lol
[08:14:28] <uGoMobi> :)
[08:14:46] <uGoMobi> well, we will find out
[08:14:48] <arschmitz> yeah im defering this one to someone with more knowledge then i have ha ha
[08:15:13] <uGoMobi> ok so far for coverTansitions
[08:15:47] <arschmitz> yeah so close PR and open feature request ticket then close it lol?
[08:16:30] <uGoMobi> haha yeah
[08:16:50] <arschmitz> seems weird to do lol
[08:17:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I created a milestone 1.5-2.0 for feature requests that we probable want to implement
[08:17:48] <uGoMobi> so we can find them between 200 closed feature requests
[08:18:07] <arschmitz> ha ha ok 
[08:18:21] <arschmitz> thats kinda an insane milestone but in this case makes sense lol
[08:18:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: or you can leave ticket open with milestone 1.5
[08:18:39] <arschmitz> hmmmmm
[08:18:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah it is, more a temporary thing until we made a new roadmap
[08:19:12] <arschmitz> i think ill go 1.5 - 2.0 only because while this is cool it does not really add anything
[08:19:22] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[08:19:26] <arschmitz> so realisticly it hsould be pretty low on priorities 
[08:19:40] <uGoMobi> I agree we have enough things with higher priority already for 1.5
[08:21:36] <arschmitz> ok ill comment and open ticket
[08:22:31] <uGoMobi> thanks

[08:26:35] <arschmitz> yeah i looked at the grunt file and figured thats what happened
[08:26:38] <gseguin> DAMMIT GSEGUIN!
[08:26:59] <arschmitz> this also means we have to change the refrence in the .min to properly refrence the source map
[08:27:06] <gseguin> is there an issue for it?
[08:27:17] <gseguin> yup
[08:27:17] <arschmitz> no but i can open one
[08:27:32] <gseguin> that'd be awesome, assign it to me
[08:27:35] <arschmitz> i also have an email from one of the CDN guys there paul forwarded me
[08:27:38] <gseguin> when do you need that done?
[08:27:52] <gseguin> you can forward it to me
[08:28:06] <arschmitz> gseguin: soon the better i guess so we can get them the right zip to get on the CDN
[08:28:55] <gseguin> for 1.3.2?
[08:29:00] <arschmitz> yes
[08:29:04] <gseguin> ok
[08:29:19] <arschmitz> we could probably just change it by hand for this one if we need to
[08:29:40] <gseguin> yeah I think that is probably the fastest option

[08:57:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6309
[08:57:31] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6309 by tschettler (1d 10h ago): Panel: Link listener fires on removed panel
[08:57:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: panel only has private method _destroy
[08:57:57] <arschmitz> as it should
[08:58:08] <arschmitz> destroy is part of the widget factory
[08:58:14] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:58:15] <arschmitz> and calls _destroy
[08:58:24] <uGoMobi> so my question was
[08:58:33] <uGoMobi> can I add destroy method
[08:58:38] <arschmitz> no
[08:58:38] <uGoMobi> that call the private method?
[08:58:51] <arschmitz> destroy is already there
[08:59:01] <uGoMobi> ah i see
[08:59:12] <arschmitz> its part of the widget factory and it does its own thing then calls _destroy
[08:59:15] <uGoMobi> that's done by the widget factory 
[08:59:19] <arschmitz> yes
[08:59:23] <uGoMobi> I see
[08:59:33] <uGoMobi> not sure why I get error then
[08:59:46] <arschmitz> let me look at the issue
[09:01:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I get Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on panel prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'destroy'  but only in my local branch where I fixed other panel issue
[09:02:15] <arschmitz> that means your calling destroy on something thats has not had the panel widget called on it
[09:02:16] <uGoMobi> and I don't get that when I make _destroy public
[09:02:48] <arschmitz> thats because by makeing destroy public its never actually being destoryed
[09:02:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I just don't see why that is
[09:03:07] <uGoMobi> ok that's explains the difference
[09:04:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: re: the issue, I think this is something the destroy method should take care of
[09:04:24] <uGoMobi> am I right?
[09:04:25] <arschmitz> let me look sounds like we are using on when it should be _on somewhere 
[09:04:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: very possible, because we don't use _on at all
[09:04:58] <arschmitz> WHAT? for real?
[09:05:08] <uGoMobi> yup
[09:05:28] <uGoMobi> oh one exception
[09:05:28] <arschmitz> ok then destroy is pointless
[09:05:45] <arschmitz> destory will never work properly if on is used
[09:05:46] <uGoMobi> we manually unbind all events
[09:05:52] <arschmitz> :(
[09:05:57] <arschmitz> thats really bad
[09:06:08] <uGoMobi> I know if we use _on destroy will do the unbinding
[09:06:19] <arschmitz> yes
[09:07:06] <arschmitz> what i want to know is how i did not already yell about this back in 1.3 lol

[09:11:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok issue is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/panel.js#L214
[09:12:21] <arschmitz> needs to be unbound but ONLY if its the last panel and is being removed
[09:12:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[09:12:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's what I wanted to do
[09:12:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and that actually should no use _on
[09:13:06] <uGoMobi> yeah, it's $.mobile.document
[09:13:10] <uGoMobi> not the widget
[09:13:14] <arschmitz> its the only case where it should be on vs _on because its shared among many instance
[09:14:30] <uGoMobi> that only leaves me with the question why my changes to fix that other issue caused this prior to initialization error
[09:14:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: didnt i already give you a check for if other panels still exist?
[09:14:40] <uGoMobi> yup
[09:14:46] <uGoMobi> it's already in _destroy
[09:14:47] <arschmitz> ok so thats easy enough then
[09:14:50] <arschmitz> cool
[09:16:07] <arschmitz> as far as cause and effect on this im not sure id need to look at exactly what was changed
[09:16:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if it's not the last panel, should we do check if the href points to ID of the panel that is being destroyed?
[09:16:53] <agcolom> Hi all :-) I don't think I'll be able to make the meeting today (it will be dinner time with my parents...)
[09:17:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I'll check first what of my changes could have caused it, if I can't find it I'll ask your help for sure:)
[09:17:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no the binding is on all a's 
[09:17:13] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom 
[09:17:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: of course, enjoy your vacation and time with your parents!
[09:17:30] <arschmitz> so the when its unbound it should also be all or nothing
[09:17:51] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:17:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im going to run and grab some lunch before meeting ill be back

[12:01:19] <arschmitz> not waiting for document ready
[12:01:25] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/otevuh/12/edit
[12:01:48] <arschmitz> because they are not waiting #testpopup does not exist yet
[12:02:07] <arschmitz> and page is not guranteed to be enhanced yet
[12:02:36] <uGoMobi> ah I see it now
[12:02:50] <uGoMobi> should have checked code
[12:03:01] <arschmitz> eh it happens 
[12:03:04] <uGoMobi> or better, should have corrected when updating their test page
[12:03:44] <uGoMobi> so tired of moving JSFiddle test pages to JS Bin, scripts to the head, etc
[12:03:45] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:03:57] <arschmitz> really not sure why they are calling popup though?
[12:04:12] <arschmitz> its inside the page so autoinit takes care of it
[12:04:13] <uGoMobi> they use to work by the way
[12:04:21] <uGoMobi> yeah, dunno either
[12:05:17] <uGoMobi> I can't test it anyway because it seems to be an 4.0 issue
[12:05:48] <arschmitz> ah i can test it
[12:05:49] <uGoMobi> but I wanted to ask that guy to test again with latest code
[12:05:58] <uGoMobi> could you reproduce the issue?
[12:06:11] <arschmitz> just a sec let me bust out the 4.0
[12:08:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will comment on and close that set timeout PR
[12:08:56] <arschmitz>  doh guess i missed charging the 4.0 last night :(

[13:06:41] <uGoMobi> I removed the 3D-ing so that should have fixed it
[13:07:02] <arschmitz> ah ok but even before i could not reproduce on my 4.0 tablet
[13:10:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you have a charged Samsung SII ?
[13:10:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think this is an emulator issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5910
[13:10:38] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5910 by BradRubenstein (3mon 2w ago): fixed header/footer do not slide when panel is revealed on Samsung S II
[13:10:54] <arschmitz> i do!
[13:10:59] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:11:03] <uGoMobi> of course you do ;)
[13:11:35] <arschmitz> pretty much if there is an s in the name i have it
[13:12:10] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:12:50] <uGoMobi> hmm we might have to test it in the webview app though
[13:13:14] <uGoMobi> I am testing that now on 4.2 with galaxy nexus
[13:13:24] <arschmitz> oh i dont have that on all the phones
[13:13:31] <arschmitz> not yet anyway
[13:14:10] <uGoMobi> I can reproduce on 4.2 nexus
[13:14:21] <uGoMobi> in webview app
[13:14:33] <arschmitz> ok so its for sure then
[13:14:45] <uGoMobi> I know we added a comment about this in the docs
[13:15:02] <uGoMobi> I can try if it's different with external toolbars
[13:15:15] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:19:54] <uGoMobi> no dice
[13:20:44] <uGoMobi> position fixed means superglued to the viewport on Android webview :/
[13:23:08] <agcolom> hi arschmitz uGoMobi, is the 1.4 alpha zip fixed now? (when it is, I will need to upload it to the new site)
[13:23:38] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom 
[13:23:51] <uGoMobi> did I miss something? was the zip broken?
[13:24:03] <agcolom> I think it was missing something
[13:24:17] <uGoMobi> oh the icons maube
[13:24:22] <uGoMobi> maybe*
[13:24:29] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ^^
[13:25:00] <gseguin> the zip for the cdn ?
[13:25:16] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ?
[13:25:48] <gseguin> the zip for Google should contain filenames with no versions
[13:25:53] <agcolom> Yes, i think that was it
[13:26:11] <uGoMobi> but that's 1.3.2
[13:26:14] <gseguin> paul_irish: should the zip file itself be versioned?
[13:26:27] <gseguin> uGoMobi: correct
[13:30:55] <agcolom> hey gseguin :-)
[13:31:54] <agcolom> I was just asking because I was under the impression that I need to change the one we currently have on the new site 
[13:32:05] <agcolom> (no rush)
[13:38:09] <frequent> uGoMobi: evening
[13:40:40] <gseguin> agcolom: I don't think there is anything for you to do though
[13:52:19] <uGoMobi> frequent: hey
[13:52:42] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[13:52:56] <frequent> I have a question regarding the filterable and list-dividers
[13:53:08] <frequent> (took me a while to find the extension...)
[13:54:29] <frequent> uGoMobi: I'm not sure why the list-divider handling needs an extension? 
[13:54:37] <uGoMobi> frequent: actually I just changed the default tonight
[13:54:50] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok
[13:54:52] <uGoMobi> for hidedividers option
[13:55:03] <frequent> sorry, I'm quite busy these days again...
[13:55:23] <frequent> still - wouldn't it make sense to just keep the handling inside filterable?
[13:55:30] <frequent> vs having another option?
[13:55:37] <uGoMobi> frequent: no problem
[13:55:52] <frequent> because inside filterable we check for widget listview and we check if it's a list-divider and ... do nothing
[13:56:02] <frequent> = let the extension handle it
[13:56:14] <frequent> uGoMobi: makes little sense to me :-)
[13:57:17] <uGoMobi> frequent: I try to remember why _|Nix|_ choose to make it an extension
[13:59:50] <uGoMobi> frequent: I am afraid I have to look at some IRC logs because I don't really remember anymore
[14:00:29] <frequent> uGoMobi: np.
[14:00:44] <uGoMobi> let's see when the change was made
[14:00:55] <frequent> uGoMobi: we can just wait until he _|Nix|_ is back :-)
[14:01:15] <uGoMobi> frequent: we probably release alpha 2 tomorrow
[14:01:25] <uGoMobi> and I don't think we can change after that
[14:01:29] <uGoMobi> if needed
[14:01:36] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok
[14:02:10] <frequent> I would have some time tomorrow to work on some issues, if there are any left on filterable.
[14:02:39] <frequent> uGoMobi: otherwise I try to chip in after alpha2 again
[14:02:46] <uGoMobi> frequent: you mentioned possible issues with selects with optgroups (dividers)
[14:02:52] <uGoMobi> might be good to test that
[14:03:11] <uGoMobi> and we have to decide what to do with selects
[14:03:22] <uGoMobi> other than that we are good I think
[14:03:24] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. I will do tomorrow and file an issue if it's not working. 
[14:03:35] <frequent> uGoMobi: dito select
[14:03:36] <uGoMobi> awesome
[14:03:55] <frequent> you release US time...? ;-)
[14:03:56] <uGoMobi> I'll will look into why we made it an extension
[14:04:02] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah
[14:04:13] <frequent> uGoMobi: pheeew
[14:04:20] <frequent> ;-)
[14:04:20] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:04:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: to be honest i thought it was weird dividers was an extension also
[14:04:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i meant to ask about it but forgot 
[14:04:38] <frequent> arschmitz: +1
[14:04:52] <uGoMobi> ok let's check that
[14:05:09] <uGoMobi> but I am in the middle of something
[14:05:25] <uGoMobi> so if ok with you I do that tomorrow morning
[14:05:33] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. I'm in the middle of going to bed, so talk to tomorrow.
[14:05:41] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[14:05:50] <uGoMobi> good night frequent 
[14:06:01] <frequent> bye
