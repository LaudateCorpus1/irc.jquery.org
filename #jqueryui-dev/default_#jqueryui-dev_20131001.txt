[00:00:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, now I add a second case where the same function also resizes it if it's smaller than the document.
[00:00:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[00:00:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Funny thing is we're not even considering the case where there's a horizontal scrollbar :)
[00:01:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The document could well be wider than the window, in which case it wouldn't cover the whole thing, but I guess we're avoiding horizontal scrollbars like they're the devil incarnate.

[02:53:13] <uGoMobi> Asmoooh: did you look?
[02:53:50] <Asmoooh> yeah, but thats black
[02:54:21] <Asmoooh> in jqm (1.3.2) you get theme a,b,c,d,e
[02:54:25] <Asmoooh> in 1.4.x they are gone
[02:54:56] <uGoMobi> Asmoooh: yes, in 1.4 we only use A and B, light and dark
[02:54:59] <Asmoooh> oh
[02:55:15] <Asmoooh> is there a way to get the original blue and yellow back?
[02:55:41] <uGoMobi> Asmoooh: I just gave you the links

[02:56:20] <uGoMobi> Asmoooh: A is black
[02:56:30] <uGoMobi> Asmoooh: what do you see at the top of the page
[02:56:50] <uGoMobi> below the header/navbar
[02:56:57] <Asmoooh> oh lol
[02:57:19] <Asmoooh> and the css file contains all of them? :)
[02:57:30] <uGoMobi> Asmoooh: did you look?
[02:57:43] <Asmoooh> i did, and i see they do :)
[02:57:54] <uGoMobi> good

[03:08:25] <uGoMobi> Asmoooh: it's the same but static list items don't get the gradient
[03:08:37] <Asmoooh> ah
[03:08:42] <uGoMobi> so they don't look like a button
[03:08:49] <uGoMobi> that was already the case in 1.3
[03:09:02] <Asmoooh> oh wait, maybe i <a href them
[03:09:14] <Asmoooh> hm, wonder why i have a scrol bar in my site and not end of the browser
[03:09:20] <Asmoooh> didnt had that before

[06:01:02] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_ uGoMobi: 
[06:37:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[06:38:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hey i had some questions about your proposed pagecontainer change
[06:38:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do ask.
[06:38:39] <arschmitz> what is the purpose of the pagecontainerbeforeinclude event it was not clear to me
[06:39:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: By the time pagecontainerload is triggered, the page has been inserted into the DOM and the page widget has been instantiated on it.
[06:39:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I introduced this event and triggered it before all that to save all that effort if you're gonna discard the page anyway.
[06:40:08] <arschmitz> hmmmmm........
[06:40:20] <arschmitz> i almost think it should be the other way around
[06:40:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IOW, with the original implementation we don't save too much even if we eliminate the need to intercept pagecontainerbeforetransition.
[06:40:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you mean "the other way around"?
[06:40:46] <arschmitz> page load should be once the page has loaded before enhancement
[06:40:58] <arschmitz> and then there should be another one where pageload is now
[06:41:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's not - not in the current implementation. I can check how it was in 1.3-stable.
[06:41:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah im just saying conceptually load should be when its loaded
[06:41:44] <arschmitz> not after its inserted
[06:41:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, the name would certainly suggest that.
[06:42:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's why I like the words "before" and "after" in event names. Makes it clear.
[06:44:22] <jquicommit> 01[13jquery-ui01] 15jzaefferer 04force-pushed 06dialog-stacking from 145a593ab to 14d0b884a: 02http://git.io/Z2HrEg
[06:44:22] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06dialog-stacking 14d0b884a 15JoÌˆrn Zaefferer: Dialog: Switch back to shuffling z-index, but only look at .ui-front siblings....
[06:44:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: 1.3-stable also triggers pageload after insertion and enhancement.
[06:44:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ugh that makes no sense
[06:45:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Tell me about it.
[06:45:02] <arschmitz> so it triggers at essentially the same time as pagechange
[06:45:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess, yeah ...
[06:45:25] <arschmitz> no sorry
[06:45:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Synchronously, at any rate.
[06:45:30] <arschmitz> pagecreate i mean
[06:45:46] <arschmitz> page create triggers at the end of the create sequence in page widget
[06:45:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, basically. Right after that.
[06:46:27] <arschmitz> hmmm..... ok lets step back for a minute and see how this SHOULD be
[06:47:02] <arschmitz> because page container events are not documented yet so we can still change their meaning
[06:47:26] <arschmitz> and page events are just in there for backcompat
[06:47:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's a good point.
[06:48:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok so do we both agree page load should be as soon as we have successfully loaded a page into memory via ajax?
[06:49:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I would say as soon as we have converted the string into a jQuery object that is a detached page.
[06:50:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok i agree with that because at that point it can be manipulated
[06:50:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: then there should be an event after the page is in the dom
[06:51:04] <arschmitz> but before the pagewidget is called
[06:51:50] <arschmitz> maybe beforeappend or something ?
[06:52:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno .. maybe that's too much granularity. Does it really make that big of a difference? Usually, if you wish to examine the incoming page it doesn't matter if it's attached or not - does it?
[06:52:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: was only thinking if you want to do some manipulation before the widget do their thing
[06:52:50] <arschmitz> but i suppose you could do that without it being attached to the dom yet
[06:53:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah - most likely.
[06:53:19] <arschmitz> and i dont think we need an event where load is right now at all
[06:53:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If there's demand for a post-load, post-attach, pre-enhance event, we can always add it later.
[06:53:27] <arschmitz> because pagecreate covers it
[06:53:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[06:53:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for sure
[06:53:51] <arschmitz> so realy we should just move load to be in the right place and thats enough then
[06:54:05] <arschmitz> and then we dont need to add the beforeinclude event
[06:54:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. So, I'll split up the _triggerWithDeprecated into the ._trigger() and the .trigger() and place each in the right spot.
[06:54:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sounds perfect
[06:55:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: +1
[06:55:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz:  ... right after lunch :)
[06:55:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome thank you.
[06:55:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just let me know when you update and ill review again
[06:55:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you think about my approach to turning off history on iOS?
[06:55:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/master...turn-off-history-on-fullscreen-ios
[06:55:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: have not reviewed that one yet thats my next thing right now
[06:56:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Should be pretty short :)
[06:56:16] <arschmitz> i looked if over briefly but want to look a little closer
[06:56:28] <arschmitz> just to make sure i dont see anything we are overlooking
[06:56:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sure. Take your time. Don't think that's absolutely necessary for 1.4.0, since it can be accomplished manually.
[06:57:18] <arschmitz> yeah we had a lot of complaints though so might be good to try and get something in and work on our own back and forward methods for 1.5
[06:57:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im curious though how does this fix the issue ?
[06:58:04] <arschmitz> because in this case history.back() does not work at all
[06:58:43] <arschmitz> this just basicly bails on history all together by disabling hash listening and updateing
[06:58:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's true, so our data-rel="back" also needs a working-history-aware solution.
[06:59:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. That means dialogs and popups will continue to work.
[06:59:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right the issue was just with back button in general
[06:59:30] <arschmitz> so it wont fix that
[06:59:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, I think the click handler also needs the same special handling that popups and dialogs already have.
[06:59:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[06:59:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When you say "back button" do you mean the browser's?
[07:00:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... cuz AFAIK there is no browser back button in fullscreen.
[07:00:13] <arschmitz> no because there is no browser back button in this case
[07:00:23] <arschmitz> i mean buttons with data-rel="back" 
[07:00:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, those need special attention.
[07:00:39] <arschmitz> yup
[07:01:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The most correct solution would probably be .pagecontainer( "back" ) and .pagecontainer( "forward" ) ....
[07:01:10] <arschmitz> yes i agree
[07:01:20] <arschmitz> we just have not made those yet
[07:01:21] <arschmitz> lol
[07:02:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i did some more digging on the symbian not getting c grade issue too
[07:02:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its a mess 
[07:02:55] <_|Nix|_> Nokia ... *shake head* ...
[07:03:14] <arschmitz> the reason why this stopped working after 1.1 is we added new support tests that include dom manipulation
[07:03:27] <arschmitz> they dont support dom manipulation
[07:03:35] <arschmitz> and just barf completely it seems like
[07:03:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! ... just ... wow!
[07:04:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and we cant ua sniff either it seems
[07:04:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No UA string?!
[07:04:32] <arschmitz> from everything i read their ua is too similar to other new symbian that are fine
[07:04:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Gah ...
[07:04:41] <arschmitz> and you cant reliably sniff for it
[07:04:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I suggest we c-grade the whole lot.
[07:05:04] <arschmitz> but based on what lol
[07:05:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I missed the word "new" in your statement above. "new" enough that it would warrant support?
[07:06:16] <arschmitz> not sure yet
[07:06:48] <arschmitz> oh man
[07:06:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can paint the words "We appologize for the inconvenience" across the whole window until the tests run. If it crashes while that's going on, well, we will at least have apologized *shrug*
[07:07:03] <arschmitz> they broadcast mozilla gecko in their UA
[07:07:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ... and I bet there are no proprietary properties or anything ...
[07:07:53] <arschmitz> um the word nokia lol 
[07:09:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: looks like maybe S40OviBrowser *could* be unique to series 40
[07:10:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You know what "ovi" means in Finnish?
[07:10:26] <arschmitz> nope
[07:10:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: "door"
[07:10:38] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15simonech opened issue #6541: New FlipSwitch doesn't update value of select element and it's impossible to refresh its state  02http://git.io/EeexfA
[07:10:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *shrug*
[07:11:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok so it looks like maybe we could sniff it but does it make sense to sniff a browser we dont support?
[07:11:35] <arschmitz> that was only ever on two phones
[07:12:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How loud were the complaints about the S40 crash?
[07:12:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there were two issues combined into one
[07:12:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, are we losing, like, 40% of our users/developers/whatever?
[07:12:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I bet not.
[07:12:38] <arschmitz> that have not been updated in quite a while
[07:12:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think making a workaround for people who need it is better
[07:13:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: AMD to the rescue.
[07:13:12] <arschmitz> make a little script that you can insert before JQM that sniffs and bails 
[07:13:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can build a module that's not included by default.
[07:13:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or that.
[07:13:37] <arschmitz> and just document if you need to support series 40 a c grade use this
[07:14:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you "bail", exactly? You need to set a flag somewhere that'll cause jQM to bail.
[07:14:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was just thinking about that
[07:14:24] <arschmitz> maybe set a prop on $.browser
[07:14:38] <arschmitz> $.browser.cgrade = true;
[07:14:48] <arschmitz> and we can chack that very first thing
[07:14:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: $.support.horrible = true;
[07:15:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah something like that
[07:15:21] <arschmitz> then anytime this comes up we can be like well sniff it and set this flag and we will bail no matter what
[07:15:36] <arschmitz> and yeah i meant support not browser lol
[07:16:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think its the most sane way to support stuff that cant even handle support tests
[07:17:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking we may wanna start a "Quirks" section in the API docs - or someplace.
[07:17:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah like a known issues section or something
[07:19:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ha ha nokia has a section for "Rogue" UA strings that *Might* show up on some devices 
[07:20:27] <arschmitz> one is AppleWebkit Safari!
[07:21:44] <_|Nix|_> Nokia ... *facepalm*
[07:22:01] <_|Nix|_> To think ... I used to work there ... *shudder*
[07:23:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How's this for a title for that section: "All hope abandon, ye who enter here!"
[07:23:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh i remember why we cant UA sniff this
[07:23:26] <arschmitz> its only SOME series 40 phones that die not all .....
[07:24:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I suppose S40 is still prevalent enough that this should matter, eh?
[07:24:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ehhhh depends on whos numbers you use
[07:24:56] <arschmitz> we really only have one person that has complained

[07:51:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No. I just identified its root cause.
[07:51:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm not sure what we can do about it.
[07:51:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh i thought you adjusted the workarounds file to at least make it isolated like in 1.3?
[07:52:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, but that doesn't help with the demos, because we have a fixed toolbar on every page.
[07:52:52] <arschmitz> other then that i think we just need to document that if you are experiencing this problem to remove the workarounds if you dont need to support those browsers
[07:53:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes but there is only so much we can do i think we can call the issue fixed and document about workarounds
[07:54:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[07:54:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then we can mark it as fixed.
[07:54:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: basicly people have to "pick their bug" which one is worse for your app
[07:54:56] <arschmitz> the ones in workarounds or the one in panel
[07:55:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Argh: _create: function() { this._super(); } ... I left that in the workarounds ... *facepalm*
[07:56:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: did you see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6494#issuecomment-25161498 maybe add three functions to pagecontainer.

[08:33:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im working on a go function this might actually pan out pretty simple
[08:34:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you go back through browser history? for ( idx = 0 ; idx < nEntries; idx++ ) { window.history.back(); } ?
[08:34:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and similarly for forward?
[08:34:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I would imagine that's insanely heavy ...
[08:35:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or does the browser history have a nice clean way of doing go() in one ... go.
[08:35:27] <_|Nix|_> ?
[08:36:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im ignoring browser history and relying on internal for right now to handle the specific case where it does not exist
[08:37:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: then ill broden the scope after that works
[08:37:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[08:37:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: would like to fix the bug first then get a more general implementation 
[08:37:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[08:38:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why not simply do in the click handler what dialog and popup do already?
[08:40:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i could but i would like to do it in pagecontainer so its easier to generalize
[08:42:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, and we'll move popup to using that after 1.4.0 is out.

[09:29:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[09:29:31] <arschmitz> thinking about normalizing our back / forward with browser
[09:29:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: do you think our back / forward should just fall back to browsers when its available and use internal when its not?
[09:30:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Definitely.
[09:30:30] <arschmitz> ok me too
[09:30:39] <arschmitz> and this is super super simple then like basicly done
[09:30:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We already have code for updating the internal history upon a browser's hashchange/popstate.
[09:30:56] <arschmitz> yup
[09:31:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ill finish up shortly and do a PR so you can take a look
[09:31:37] <arschmitz> but its REALLY simple to do this right
[09:33:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: id like you to take a look because you have dealt with a lot more of the hash change oddities then i have with popup and such

[09:46:03] <b-ot> arschmitz: Pull request #6543 by arschmitz (29s ago): Pagecontainer: add back forward and go methods to allow navigation based...
[09:49:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looking ...
[09:50:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It really is similar to dialog. The only thing is that dialog has that extra cleanup for the URL you end up passing to changePage(). The other thing is that you might just want to call this.change(...).
[09:50:31] <arschmitz> oh right i do
[09:50:34] <arschmitz> was not thinking
[09:50:44] <arschmitz> good catch lol
[09:50:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not sure if those checks are still necessary.
[09:51:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its using the url out of our history object so its already cleaned up
[09:51:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Those checks might not be necessary anymore.
[09:52:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you plug in the new functionality into the library and the unit tests pass, then it should be good.
[09:52:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the next thing is to make data-rel="back" work with this
[09:53:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: which is easy right now but will get trickier in the future
[09:53:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We're gonna have a lot of .closest( ":mobile-pagecontainer" ).pagecontainer( "back" )
[09:53:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly what i was thinking about
[09:53:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That'll make it slower.
[09:54:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We might wanna add a this.pagecontainer to our widgets, just like the way they have this.window and this.document.
[09:54:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was thinking we should have a new prop to replace $.mobile.pageContainer
[09:54:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, that should be an extension.
[09:54:36] <arschmitz> $.mobile.activeContainer which will be the last updated container
[09:55:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What use is that information?
[09:55:22] <arschmitz> so then data-rel="back" would just do $.mobile.activeContainer.pagecontainer( "back" );
[09:55:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What sets the value of $.mobile.activeContainer?
[09:55:58] <arschmitz> pageContainer when change is called
[09:56:03] <arschmitz> would set it to itself
[09:56:45] <arschmitz> and once we support setting a target for links 
[09:56:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but if, in the future, you have two pagecontainers side-by-side on the page, then, if the left one sets itself as active and you click a back link inside the right one, then the left one will go back.
[09:57:09] <arschmitz> if you set a target it will nav the target container
[09:57:20] <arschmitz> and if you dont set a target it will be the last one that was changed
[09:57:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but you shouldn't need to set a target by default.
[09:57:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's counterintuitive.
[09:57:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Intuitively, the one the link is in should be affected.
[09:57:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... by default.
[09:58:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: At that point, they become like iframes.
[09:58:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and people are familiar with iframes
[09:58:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well containers are like iframes really
[09:58:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but i agree default could be parent container
[09:58:58] <arschmitz> and have a target option to "global" or something
[09:59:07] <arschmitz> that would use activeContainer
[09:59:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The problem is how do we do that without using .closest()?
[09:59:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you dont 
[09:59:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess we can use .parents( ":mobile-pagecontainer" )
[09:59:37] <arschmitz> its just one of those things 
[09:59:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That should be fairly fast, because it simply goes up the tree to html.
[10:00:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: closest is better in that case it finds only 1 and stops
[10:00:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Even better.
[10:00:20] <arschmitz> parents will keep going even after it finds one
[10:00:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see.
[10:00:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, that doesn't sound all that bad.
[10:00:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no i dont think so
[10:01:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course, we could always move the click handler inside pagecontainer as well. But at that point it's just getting out of hand - unless we break it into extensions.
[10:01:17] <arschmitz> and i think we should track the "activeContainer" for traditional backbutton use
[10:01:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's a good point.
[10:01:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We're gonna need a meta-history object.
[10:02:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its something we could thinkabout but for now i think just use the deprecated pageContainer
[10:02:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[10:02:21] <arschmitz> and once we support linktargeting figure out the best way to do this
[10:02:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's quite a d00zy.
[10:02:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: using the deprecated pageContainer will make this work for now and fix the ios Bug
[10:03:32] <arschmitz> and since we are already in beta i want to keep any changes as small as possible
[10:04:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed.
[10:04:30] <arschmitz> cool so ill finish implementing this to handle data-rel="back" and call it a day until 1.5 for this
[10:04:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm still a little unsure about the quality of the "url" property of the history entry. I really hope it's improved since I wrote that dialog thing.
[10:05:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and that the type of url that change() expects is always exactly the type that the entry provides.
[10:05:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if we notice any problems or get any bugs we can easily add in the logic from dialog
[10:05:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's true.
[10:06:15] <arschmitz> this is pretty isolated since its only when hash listening is disabled
[10:06:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, it might be worth yanking it out of dialog and just calling this, and seeing if the dialog tests go south.
[10:06:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: simple enough to do
[10:06:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The sequence and navigation tests should batter this code quite heavily.
[10:06:46] <arschmitz> perfect
[10:07:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ill do that and see what happens 
[10:07:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The sequence tests try all kinds of funky initial URLs like http://domain/path/to/file.html#/path/to/otherfile.html&ui-state=dialog and stuff like that.
[10:08:04] <arschmitz> cool if it trips up i know i need to add in url logic from dialog
[10:08:16] <_|Nix|_> +1
[10:08:44] <arschmitz> im going to go get some lunch shortly ill run tests when i get back and let you know how it goes
[10:09:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!

[12:01:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so actually managed to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6494#issuecomment-25161498
[12:01:44] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6494 by ghost (1w 3d ago): navigation iOS 7 broken on app cache
[12:02:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome
[12:02:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we just need to decide to feature detect for it being a homescreen app
[12:02:36] <arschmitz> or make them just set hashListening to be disabled
[12:03:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you find any info from Apple about this change
[12:03:30] <uGoMobi> ?
[12:04:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is it a bug or a deliberate choice?
[12:04:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no it seems like a bug
[12:04:35] <arschmitz> because its only a combination of appcache and homescreen app that cause it
[12:04:48] <uGoMobi> right
[12:04:53] <arschmitz> and that should not relate to the history object in any way i can think of
[12:05:17] <uGoMobi> yeah, doesn't make sense
[12:05:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: personally i think we should make them set hashlistening to disabled them selves because to do it right it requres a combination of feature detect and ua sniffing
[12:06:03] <uGoMobi> so if we go for feature detect it will work again once Apple bug is fixed
[12:06:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sadly no because what we need to look for is just if its in fullscreen mode and turn it off any time its in fullscreen
[12:07:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok then I am in favor of let people set hashListening to false
[12:07:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so really you would have to see if your in fullscreen AND then UA sniff to see if its ios7 because 5 and 6 are fine
[12:07:42] <uGoMobi> :(
[12:08:01] <arschmitz> which i think we should have people do this themselves if they are supporting fullscreen in ios7
[12:08:14] <arschmitz> we can provide the snippet in the docs
[12:08:35] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:09:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on the plus side pagecontainer has 3 new methods that are handy
[12:09:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I saw that
[12:09:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: a go method that you pass an integer and it will go forward or back that many entries in history 
[12:09:42] <uGoMobi> nice
[12:09:49] <arschmitz> with out needing browser history at all
[12:10:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and then forward and back which just pass 1 or -1
[12:10:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so now data-rel="back" will work with hashlistening disabled
[12:10:39] <uGoMobi> that's cool
[12:11:09] <arschmitz> also factors the handling of back button out of dialog and potentially popup too
[12:11:23] <uGoMobi> I was about to ask about popup
[12:12:00] <arschmitz> i need to talk to _|Nix|_ about popup
[12:12:09] <arschmitz> that might have to wait for 1.5
[12:12:45] <uGoMobi> probably better since we are on beta
[12:12:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but its half the puzzle of factoring nav out of widgets
[12:14:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what were your thoughts on RC time frame?
[12:15:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am thinking next week, Wednesday maybe
[12:15:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that would mean two weeks after beta
[12:15:50] <uGoMobi> but the alphas have been out for some time already
[12:15:51] <arschmitz> cool sounds good to me bugs have been really minimal
[12:16:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: our main concern is all other stuff we have to update before final
[12:16:34] <arschmitz> and i think pretty much all the significant ones now have fixes i think

[12:21:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im curious about flipswitch one too that came in but not test page
[12:21:07] <arschmitz> and not great discription 
[12:21:27] <arschmitz> and i thought i had unit tests for that
[12:22:34] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15arschmitz pushed 1 new commit to 06pagecontainer-history: 02http://git.io/q3dyVA
[12:22:34] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06pagecontainer-history 14c622191 15Alexander Schmitz: Pagecontainer: make go method use change and adjust $.mobile.back to use back method in pagecontainer Fixes #6494 - navigation iOS 7 broken on app cache
[12:23:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, I left it open because I wanted to test myself
[12:23:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if I understood him correctly the wrong value is submitted if you have switched
[12:28:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok I can now reproduce that dynamically inject header and page padding issue
[12:29:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok ill look at that 
[12:29:10] <uGoMobi> not sure why I don't see it first time I load the test page
[12:29:45] <uGoMobi> both on Chrome and FF I didn't see it when I loaded the page first time
[12:30:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can reproduce the issue with flipswitch too there is a missing event binding in the case they describe
[12:30:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: easy fix though
[12:45:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up with popup?
[12:45:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well first of all tests passed
[12:45:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[12:45:37] <arschmitz> so no need to add logic for url
[12:45:54] <arschmitz> and was just talking about factoring the history and backbutton out of popup
[12:46:27] <arschmitz> this is essentially the first step for that but only handles part of the issue
[12:46:38] <arschmitz> because still need to deal with link binding side of things
[12:46:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and the non-deep-linkable url calculation.
[12:47:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[12:47:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but on another note
[12:47:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, there is a problem with popup link binding: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/5c0ba285dab2459756161ed22633090f8d124247/js/jquery.mobile.links.js#L31-37
[12:47:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I added that before 1.3 and I'm not really proud of it, because it adds two handlers per popup, which never get removed :(
[12:48:02] <arschmitz> you mean the massive amount of linkbinding?
[12:48:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah :(
[12:48:16] <arschmitz> so yes lol
[12:49:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: iv been brainstorming on linkbinding for 1.5 and i have some ideas to clean this all up
[12:49:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was kinda hoping to get a fix in for 1.4 though, because it's terrible. It might even be the cause for why popups take so long to show up.
[12:50:01] <arschmitz> in a completely sane and maintainable way for all widgets
[12:51:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have a solution for getting rid of that that should be OK for 1.4, because it's not such a major change.
[12:51:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok sounds good
[12:52:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/master...handle-popup-links
[12:52:07] <_|Nix|_> What do you think?
[12:54:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's a fundamentally sticky issue with links that open popups. They each have an attribute called "aria-expanded" which needs to be updated whenever the popup opens/closes.
[12:54:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This requires going over the whole DOM and updating all the links that refer to the given popup - even those on other pages.
[12:55:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: only think i see really is i dont see the need to set the handlers array and push to it becase we want to factor this out in 1.5 anyway so in theory nothing else will ever use this
[12:56:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, should I just set a property on it?
[12:56:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, popupHandler.
[12:56:42] <_|Nix|_> ?>
[12:57:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: or just put it back in links.js since at this point it only handles popup anyway
[12:57:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. Good point. I'll put it back, but without the event handlers.
[12:57:43] <arschmitz> then we can create something that is a shared mechanism to store these in 1.5 
[12:57:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess the fundamental change is that I do this.document.find( "[aria-haspopup='true'][aria-owns='" +  id + "']" ).attr( "aria-expanded", false ); arschmitz: I guess the fundamental change is that I do this.document.find( "[aria-haspopup='true'][aria-owns='" +  id + "']" ).attr( "aria-expanded", false ); 
[12:57:55] <_|Nix|_> Oops. Sorry about the dupe :/
[12:57:59] <arschmitz> right that part looks good
[12:58:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Better than two event handlers per link ... sheeesh!
[12:58:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What was I thinking ...
[12:58:23] <arschmitz> but no point in factoring out the handler until we know how we want to do this for ALL widgets
[12:58:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed.
[12:58:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We definitely need a cleanly pluggable link handling setup.
[12:58:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: this isnt too far from what i had inmind
[12:58:55] <arschmitz> as far as registering a handler 
[12:59:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe even do away with data-rel="this" and data-rel="that"
[12:59:14] <arschmitz> but im thinking something more a little more automatic 
[12:59:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: data-rel="<widgetname>" might be generic
[12:59:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... if we wanna keep data-rel.
[12:59:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats kinda what i was thinking
[12:59:46] <arschmitz> take the same route as with init selector
[13:00:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah
[13:00:08] <arschmitz> and have it automatic based on widget name
[13:00:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and maybe have added methods with special meaning
[13:00:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We could go another way: this.element.data( "handleLink", function() {} );
[13:01:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and then handler = $( link.attr( "href" ) ).data( "handleLink" );
[13:01:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was thinking that if there is a data rel check if a matching widget exists and have a magic method that is always called on the widget
[13:01:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This could do that without the need for data-rel.
[13:02:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The magic is in the data key.
[13:02:21] <arschmitz> so if there is a link with data-rel="popup" then the linkbinding would call $("link").popup("linkopen")
[13:02:31] <arschmitz> or something
[13:03:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why not do the poor man's polymorphism though? We implement the link handling interface on the element referred to by the link's href via a single data item that has a magic name.
[13:03:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: scott_gonzalez showed me how to retrieve arbitrary data as quickly as possible: $.data( element, key );
[13:04:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait. No. You're right.
[13:04:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking.
[13:04:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Too many data items.
[13:04:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or not?
[13:04:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[13:04:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why have another data item, when we already have the /widget/ data item.
[13:05:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but then we need to retain the data-rel.
[13:05:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah this way all we have to do is a getAttribute make sure that widget exists and call it
[13:05:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: whats so wrong with data-rel?
[13:05:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... extra markup ...
[13:06:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It would be cool to automagically determine what kind of widget is "activated" by the link.
[13:06:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But then there could be several link-aware widgets on the same link.
[13:06:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean on the same element.
[13:06:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So better to be explicit.
[13:06:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that and also it requires a lot of extra code
[13:06:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[13:06:43] <arschmitz> not really a lot but extra
[13:06:58] <arschmitz> and when it comes to history best to leave as little as possible to chance i think
[13:06:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and extra data.
[13:07:12] <arschmitz> i like explicit lol
[13:07:17] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:07:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright. Sounds good!
[13:07:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i might just add one additional check
[13:08:01] <arschmitz> that not only does a widget with that name exist but that its actually been initialized on the target 
[13:08:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, definitely.
[13:08:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: $.mobile.popup.handleLink does that too.
[13:08:48] <arschmitz> though if we dont check that then you get the error saying its un initialized just like if you called it directly with js
[13:08:57] <arschmitz> which actually seems like it might be a good think
[13:08:59] <arschmitz> thing
[13:09:18] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. Don't wanna fail silently.
[13:09:37] <_|Nix|_> Like, "WTF does this link not work! *click* *click* *click* *click* *mouse breaks*"
[13:09:49] <arschmitz> yup
[13:10:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This is actually shaping up nicely.
[13:10:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[13:10:50] <arschmitz> iv been putting a lot of thought into it lol
[13:10:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I think we should end up getting classical anchors for free.
[13:11:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i want widgets to be able to interact with history in a sane way
[13:11:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... cuz, like, there's nothing /at/ that href that we recognize, so *shrug* ... 
[13:11:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah at that point we could just bail
[13:11:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: or add a special data-rel for those worst case
[13:12:15] <arschmitz> data-rel="anchor" jump to that 
[13:12:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, we definitely need a simple method - which we already have ($.mobile.navigator.go(), IINM), but we should be able to omit the URL parameter and just pass in an option, like, deepLink: false.
[13:12:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nah ... if there are no handlers, let the browser handle it.
[13:13:15] <arschmitz>  _|Nix|_: yeah iv been thinking about that too and i think i have some ideas to make no history work too
[13:13:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Basically, we should separate the concept of non-deep-linkable URLs from its implementation.
[13:14:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[13:14:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh i realized something though
[13:14:45] <arschmitz> for individual pagecontainer history to work
[13:14:54] <arschmitz> we will need to store history on each pagecontainer
[13:15:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For sure.
[13:15:04] <arschmitz> so there is a local and a global history
[13:15:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes. I called it a meta-history earlier.
[13:15:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's a record of "something happened in pagecontainer a; something happened in pagecontainer b; something ha..."
[13:16:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah but history is already implemented in a way to make this already done 
[13:16:42] <arschmitz> we can in create do this.history = New $.mobile.History()
[13:17:05] <arschmitz> already and it sets up history on that pagecontainer with all its normal methods and its own stack
[13:17:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The interesting sequence will be this: 1. pagecontainer a: go to some URL; 2. pagecontainer b: go to some URL; 3. pagecontainer a: go back
[13:17:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do we render this in browser history?
[13:17:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess we'd have to actually create a new browser history item for the "go back" part.
[13:18:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but then the browser's back/forward button will have the exact opposite effect inside pagecontainer a for those two history items.
[13:18:58] <arschmitz> yeah things we will have to figure out
[13:19:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just hope that such a mapping is at-all possible in a sane way.
[13:19:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the meantime, we should put in place all enablers for easily exploring these things.
[13:21:19] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gabrielschulhof 04deleted 06handle-popup-links at 145d2d0ec: 02http://git.io/6GMDcA
[13:23:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the browser back button should always act like with iframes
[13:24:16] <arschmitz> it just replays what ever history entries there are in the order they happened
[13:24:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and its the devs responsibility to make sure their urls resolve correctly 
[13:25:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I guess we can use the browser's behaviour as a template.
[13:25:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: as we always should
[13:25:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... cuz honestly I dunno how it behaves.
[13:26:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: basicly it puts everything including the iframe into one big stack
[13:27:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so basicly lets say you have a page with 2 iframes
[13:28:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you click a linke in A then click 2 links in B first back buttons goes back 1 in be second click goes back again in B third click goes back 1 in A then fourth click makes the page go back 
[13:29:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but what if you do window.history.back() inside an iframe. Does that affect the global browser history?
[13:30:00] <arschmitz> pretty sure but i would have to test to be 100%
[13:30:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because if that's the case, then, if the last thing you did was open a link in iframe 2, then, if you run window.history.back() in iframe 1, it will go back in iframe 2.
[13:30:31] <arschmitz> hmmmmm i need to try this lol
[13:30:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was about to jsbin.
[13:34:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:  it does do that
[13:34:23] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ifuguXE/1/edit
[13:34:45] <arschmitz> click a link in second one that click back in first one
[13:37:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. So, we wanna do that too?
[13:37:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i would think so
[13:38:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It makes sense with browser history on, but without it, we could do the cool thing and have the back thing go back in its own "iframe".
[13:38:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im thinking we flipflop what we talked about earlier
[13:39:20] <arschmitz> its always global unless you specifiy a target then it goes back on in that target
[13:40:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but how do we reconcile that with browser history if it's turned on?
[13:40:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but in this case im thinking we would have to add a new history entry to preserve this new unique state
[13:40:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[13:42:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we could fool browser in this case by selectivly picking between push and replace state
[13:44:46] <arschmitz> at one point i talked to johnbender about switching to push for the general case then we could use replace in special non history situations
[13:46:59] <arschmitz> which as i recall he was fine with we just need to force ios4 out of pushstate which we already documented we were going to do but have not yet
[13:47:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: anyway gota run for now
