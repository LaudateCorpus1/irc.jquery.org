[00:58:03] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #572: STILL UNSTABLE in 18 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/572/
[04:26:10] <arschmitz> gschulhof: jasperdegroot: Ping!
[04:26:33] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: pong
[04:26:50] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: so not sure if you saw everything from friday and this weekend 
[04:27:04] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: but the demos have hundreds and hundreds of issues
[04:27:12] <arschmitz> not exagerating
[04:27:28] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah :(
[04:28:08] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: so im working my way through fixing stuff but its often the case that fixing 1 thing uncovers several more
[04:30:24] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: but this should find most errors in the demos from not on it spiders every page and finds all dead links 404's resource load errors js errors 
[04:30:56] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: and for both the build demos and the php ones casper was lying before and only checking the php ones twice 
[04:31:21] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, saw your conversation with Ghislain
[04:32:54] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: do you want to try to fix everything for 1.4.3?
[04:34:02] <gschulhof> arschmitz: What's up?
[04:34:44] <gschulhof> OK. I just read.
[04:34:59] <gschulhof> How can I help?
[04:37:16] <gschulhof> jzaefferer: Ping! I would like to turn off qunit's exception handling, so I can turn on break-on-exception in Chrome Dev tools.
[04:37:36] <gschulhof> jzaefferer: Do you know how to do that?
[04:39:45] <gschulhof> Hmmm ... config.notrycatch ...
[04:40:53] <gschulhof> Had to look at the source though ... if I don't know it's called notrycatch, Google isn't very helpful.
[04:47:14] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i dont think we can release with broken links and errors in demos
[04:48:13] <arschmitz> gschulhof: not really much you can help with i think we would be stepping on eachothers toes fixing same things
[04:48:29] <arschmitz> gschulhof: and often different issues have same root cause 
[04:50:37] <gschulhof> arschmitz: You're right.
[04:51:10] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yeah would love help just does not seem like a good use of both of our time
[04:51:32] <gschulhof> Yeah, it sounds like it's pretty tangled - not easily divisible.
[04:51:37] <arschmitz> gschulhof: thankfully MOST of it is pretty simple 
[04:52:23] <arschmitz> gschulhof: not all lol but most...
[04:52:45] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i even make it check all the internal links to try and coax out errors lol
[04:53:07] <arschmitz> like #somepanelorpopupormultipageorwhatever
[06:14:43] <gseguin> jasperdegroot, arschmitz: I'm available until 12:00 MDT

[13:34:14] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: explains why gschulhof was not in the channel though
[13:36:19] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: gseguin: gschulhof: iv kinda established 3 new conventions as part of this 1) when linking to a page that does not exist on purpose name it notapage this will be ignored by spider 2) to not have a page spidered add ignore to the name of it and it will be ignored 3) operation timed out errors for resources will be ignored because they happen totally at random and mean nothing
[13:37:23] <arschmitz> one cavet of 3 is if this happens to the wrong resource it can make the tests totally crash and burn but this is pretty rare and i think unavoidable 
[13:37:45] <arschmitz> like if jquery happens to be the thing that times out well then thats clearly going to cause issues lol
[13:39:01] <gschulhof> Aye, aye, sir!
[13:39:33] <gschulhof> Can you write that down somewhere?
[13:39:59] <gschulhof> Can we make a mobile-specific extension to the contribute.jquery.org?
[13:40:16] <gschulhof> It would then cover third-party demo PRs.
[13:41:19] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yeah we will do something just not sure best place and if it needs to be on something like contribute there are only 3 places so far in the demos where this comes up
[13:41:38] <arschmitz> gschulhof: one thing i think we need to talk about is use of php in demos
[13:41:44] <arschmitz> this is not an issues in 3 demos 
[13:42:00] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I was just thinking: Is there a PHP interpreter written in JS?
[13:42:06] <arschmitz> and there is no reason we cant use php on demos.jquerymobile.com 
[13:42:12] <gschulhof> arschmitz: That, plus mockjax would give us the server-side on the client side.
[13:42:35] <arschmitz> only is an issue in zip file
[13:42:48] <gschulhof> True.
[13:42:51] <arschmitz> gschulhof: thats a possiblity but not sure if it really makes sense 
[13:43:10] <arschmitz> gschulhof: also i can think of more php demos we are going to want to add so its something we need to figure out and decide
[13:43:13] <gschulhof> arschmitz: You're probably right. It's probably killing a fly with a thermonuclear weapon.
[13:43:17] <arschmitz> like we are going to add error page support
[13:43:27] <arschmitz> and so we will need php to be able to demo that
[13:43:43] <gschulhof> *nod*
[13:44:13] <arschmitz> so right now im leaning towards doing as we are now but adding a way to leave in some of the php demos
[13:44:30] <arschmitz> and just have a warning on them
[13:45:14] <gschulhof> I'm biased towards making the php redirect demo work - since I wrote it, and it's the only one featuring PHP in the "View Source"
[13:45:41] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yes and another big one is the events demo lol
[13:45:46] <arschmitz> the ones people are waiting for
[13:45:52] <arschmitz> cant work without php currently
[13:45:57] <gschulhof> *nod*
[13:46:36] <arschmitz> so i think we need to make it work with php one way or another
[13:47:14] <arschmitz> for demos that need it
[13:47:44] <arschmitz> php redirect / optimized widgets / events so far
[13:47:54] <arschmitz> and error pages and who knows what else in future
[13:48:27] <arschmitz> gschulhof: oh also talked to infra and found a way to improve the response time on events demo
[13:48:46] <arschmitz> gschulhof: so it will cache the xml on server and only redownload if its actually changed
[13:49:10] <gschulhof> arschmitz: What about using the vaunted CDN for the XML?
[13:49:40] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Like, http://code.jquery.com/mobile/git/api-git.xml or whatever.
[13:49:40] <arschmitz> gschulhof: we would never put the api xml on the cdn
[13:49:57] <arschmitz> cdn is for production files
[13:50:01] <gschulhof> Right, OK.
[13:50:11] <gschulhof> Well, I know next to nothing about such things.
[13:50:28] <arschmitz> gschulhof: the cdn is really just for people to use the libs in production 
[13:55:56] <arschmitz> gschulhof: how many unique links do you think there are in the demos take a wild guess?
[13:56:13] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I dunno ... 248>
[13:56:14] <gschulhof> >
[13:56:15] <gschulhof> ?
[13:56:24] <arschmitz> gschulhof: 902
[13:56:38] <gschulhof> Well, at least I got the order of magnitude right ...
[13:56:56] <arschmitz> gschulhof: lol yeah
[13:57:16] <arschmitz> gschulhof: its kinda misleading though because that includes auto generate quicklinks on each page
[13:57:56] <gschulhof> Well, if it's user-visible, it's user-visible.
[14:00:17] <gschulhof> arschmitz: On web-ui-fw I would render all the API docs as plain HTML so I could put them on github pages. So, there too were a lot of links that needed resolving.
[14:00:30] <gschulhof> Fortunately, in that case, wget was sufficient for most.
[14:01:15] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yeah and i figure it could also be an internal page never know
[14:01:26] <arschmitz> gschulhof: and that could cause an error
[14:01:32] <gschulhof> Right.
