[08:26:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[08:26:36] <gseguin> arschmitz: is the website associated with demos.jquerymobile.com up and running?
[08:27:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[08:27:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! I guess I'm not going to squash commits by outside contributors. But what about team mebers?
[08:27:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There're two commits on navbar that I could squash. One is mine, and one is agcolom's.
[08:29:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe I can set the author to jquery-devs-team@googlegroups.com and mention the original authors in the extended description.
[08:30:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Still, any such action is going to affect the statistics displayed on the Web site.
[08:30:39] <_|Nix|_> I mean on GH.
[08:30:45] <_|Nix|_> Do we care, though?
[08:31:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: one sec, I am in a call
[08:31:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP.
[08:31:50] <arschmitz> gseguin: no
[08:32:36] <gseguin> arschmitz: any ETA on that, gnarf?

[08:32:59] <gnarf> gseguin: I can take care of it later tonight

[08:40:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am back
[08:41:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you have a suggestion regarding squashing commits of multiple team members?
[08:42:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: personally unless some one is super concerned about their commit count i dont see an issue
[08:42:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also if they are from multiple team memebers i assume at least one if not both commits are trivial?
[08:43:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't care about count, not sure if it is a problem if an employer is sponsoring
[08:44:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: can we just check with them to see if they care?
[08:45:02] <_|Nix|_> Well, OK, since the list is not long, we can agree right here and now.
[08:45:38] <uGoMobi> gseguin _|Nix|_ : would that be a problem ^^^
[08:45:42] <_|Nix|_> I'm OK with having my commits squashed.
[08:46:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ^
[08:46:12] <rxaviers> uGoMobi, arschmitz, perhaps adding a "signed-off by" @user in the commit message for each respective ones
[08:46:13] <rxaviers> ?
[08:46:27] <_|Nix|_> rxaviers: Not bad.
[08:47:06] <rxaviers> :)
[08:47:37] <_|Nix|_> rxaviers: That's probably the way to go, actually, because it retains the concept of authorship, especially considering that we are aware of our own policy :)
[08:47:55] <uGoMobi> we just have a new commit message standard
[08:48:44] <uGoMobi> not sure if it fits in ;)
[08:49:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IINM, this does not become a part of the commit message, but is rather commit metadata.
[08:49:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So the commit message remains unaffected.
[08:49:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh, I didn't know that
[08:49:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thought it was added at the end of the extended message
[08:49:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not AFAIK.
[08:50:08] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:50:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, NM. It /is/ added to the end of the commit message.
[08:50:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But that's OK, because it's not added to the first line.
[08:50:35] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't worry about # of commits that exist (as in squashing changes across committers doesn't seem necessary).
[08:51:28] <scott_gonzalez> My concern with the number of commits was just that it seemed like there were lots of tiny commits that probably should've been a single commit, and with 1-4 and master being so divergent, it was hard to see what belonged where.
[08:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> Since we knew that some commits in 1-4 belonged in master.
[08:51:49] <scott_gonzalez> The real concern is just maintainability.
[08:52:01] <scott_gonzalez> And being able to cherry-pick updates across old versions easily.
[08:52:05] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, I've now sorted out that part, and I'm in the process of reducing the number of commits.
[08:52:18] <_|Nix|_> So I'll maintain the author boundary.
[08:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers _|Nix|_: Never add "Signed-off-by" with someone else's name.
[08:52:40] <uGoMobi> yeah, one or two commits more or less shouldn't be the problem
[08:52:50] <rxaviers> why scott?
[08:52:52] <_|Nix|_> OK. That's easiest.
[08:53:04] <_|Nix|_> rxaviers: Ummm ... it could be construed as impersonating someone.
[08:53:15] <_|Nix|_> I guess ...
[08:53:22] <scott_gonzalez> That's one issue.
[08:53:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's also rude to change someone's commit and say that they signed off on it.
[08:53:48] <_|Nix|_> I'm already uncomfartable enough editing someone else's commit (because of a merge conflict) as I cherry-pick.
[08:54:32] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... that typo severely reduced the intended gravity of my statement :/ ... :)
[08:54:36] <scott_gonzalez> Linux actually has a policy that if a maintainer needs to modify a signed commit, they need to amend the commit message with their own signed-off-by and a description of the changes.
[08:55:22] <scott_gonzalez> Also, in many projects, the signed-off-by line is a legal agreement.
[08:55:58] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's actually funny. You would think that such a maintainer could create a second commit ... I mean, it's starting to look like a git repo inside a commit :)
[08:56:37] <_|Nix|_> But, of course, I doubt that there's ever more than one maintainer who would thusly modify a commit.
[08:57:28] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L355-L376
[08:57:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looks like you can just squash the commits in this case
[08:59:06] <rxaviers> makes sense
[09:01:00] <rxaviers> well scott, but as far as I understood it, it accepts multiple signed-off-by. The point is stating exactly what each commiter did.
[09:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> Adding someone else's signed-off-by is not allowed.
[09:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> It exists as a legal agreement.
[09:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> Although we're not using such an agreement in jQuery projects.
[09:02:00] <scott_gonzalez> It's still a very bad thing to do.
[09:02:07] <rxaviers> In the case of squashing you are not making it up, you are squashing an previous existing one.
[09:02:16] <rxaviers> a*
[09:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> You're doing two things.
[09:02:40] <scott_gonzalez> You're changing the patch and you're adding a sign-off that didn't exist.
[09:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> As stated in the Linux DCO "it is very impolite to change one submitter's code and make him endorse your bugs"
[09:03:40] <_|Nix|_> Anyway ... doesn't sound like it's worth doing ... especially not for a squash ...
[09:04:00] <rxaviers> "it is recommended that you add a line between the last Signed-off-by header and yours, indicating the nature of your changes"
[09:04:06] <rxaviers> :p
[09:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, you are not allowed to add someone else's name to a sign-off.
[09:04:27] <scott_gonzalez> You can only add your name with a description of changes.
[09:04:31] <rxaviers> ok, I understood your point.
[09:04:32] <rxaviers> anyway..
[09:04:53] <rxaviers> We could ask each commiter to squash its own commit then
[09:05:10] <rxaviers> It would produce the same thing, using a slightly different process
[09:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> That's pointless work. We can squash just as easily.
[09:05:53] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, for sure. My issue was with commits by two different authors.
[09:06:01] <scott_gonzalez> Just don't squash them.

[10:25:09] <fnagel> Wiki says "Fixed #xxx", is that intended?

[11:19:52] <agcolom> Up to you...
[11:20:01] <uGoMobi> We can re-use it
[11:20:09] <uGoMobi> just have to do about the address
[11:20:20] <agcolom> oh yes and yes
[11:20:29] <uGoMobi> and it's tricky to mention who already donated
[11:20:39] <uGoMobi> because we forget to update :/
[11:20:47] <agcolom> oh...
[11:21:24] <agcolom> also for the address whose should it be? 
[11:21:36] <uGoMobi> I know that we received HTC Mazaa WP7.8 devices, but don't see it on that list
[11:21:46] <uGoMobi> so let's just say thanks in general
[11:21:50] <agcolom> ok
[11:22:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think no street address
[11:22:24] <uGoMobi> just an email address that you contact if you want to send a device
[11:22:44] <uGoMobi> we have a team email address now, let me test that
[11:22:53] <agcolom> do we???
[11:23:08] <agcolom> I was not aware of this... That sounds good!
[11:24:23] <uGoMobi> yeah, mobile-team at jquery dot com
[11:24:54] <agcolom> nice!

[11:34:54] <_|Nix|_> OK. There it is.
[11:35:12] <_|Nix|_> master and 1-3 coincide. 1-4 is on top of master.
[11:35:27] <uGoMobi> only one commit now? "Docs: Update to 1.4" ;-)
[11:35:35] <_|Nix|_> We can fast-forward master into 1-4.
[11:35:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. Altogether 176 commits.
[11:35:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The first, like, 25 of those are 1-3, the rest are 1-4.
[11:35:58] <uGoMobi> wow 100 commits less
[11:36:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. It was, like, 257 or 262 or something like that.
[11:36:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice work, thanks!
[11:37:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just hope I didn't majorly fsck anything up ...
[11:37:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I hope so too :)
[11:38:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if anything needs to go into both 1-3 and 1-4 at this point, it needs to be committed to 1-4 and then cherry-picked to 1-3.
[11:38:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: When we fast-forward master int 1-4, then those commits will end up on master. We'll stop keeping master and 1-4 in sync after we release 1-4.
[11:39:07] <_|Nix|_> Well, I guess I might as well fast-forward master into 1-4.
[11:39:12] <_|Nix|_> Remove the ambiguity ...
[11:39:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's just wait
[11:39:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or, let's just wait.
[11:39:34] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:39:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we should always do that just before release
[11:39:55] <uGoMobi> or better... as part of the release process
[11:40:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OKOK, but please don't commit anything to master then, because then I need to rebase ... again ...
[11:40:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I understand
[11:40:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, one thing we need to do as part of the commit process is to ./set-lib-versions <core_version> <jqm_version>
[11:40:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and then commit
[11:40:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean as part of the release process.
[11:41:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Currently all examples refer to core 1.10.2 and jqm git.
[11:41:13] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:41:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, when we release 1.4.0, you need to ./set-lib-versions 1.10.2 1.4.0
[11:41:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sounds like we need a new release checklist for API docs
[11:41:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That updates all the resources/** and entries2html.xsl
[11:41:56] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:42:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or an item on an existing checklist ...

[12:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Can you confirm that the output from `npm publish` looked good?
[12:26:04] <rxaviers> yeap
[12:26:05] <rxaviers> it did.
[12:26:30] <rxaviers> Running  `npm install download.jqueryui.com@1.10.3-9` here, works
[12:26:39] <rxaviers> Although, it doesn't work on jq02 server .. :-S
[12:27:21] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't work for me locally either.
[12:28:16] <rxaviers> intriguing
[12:28:25] <rxaviers> can you open this https://registry.npmjs.org/download.jqueryui.com/1.10.3-9?
[12:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[12:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> And look at this: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/8029349
[12:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> It sees the right version, but can't find the files.
[12:31:56] <rxaviers> yeap crazy
[12:32:03] <rxaviers> I think this delay is part of their campaign to get funds for servers
[12:32:04] <rxaviers> :D
[12:33:57] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:36:23] <rxaviers> it's so weird it works here
[12:36:24] <rxaviers> https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/e19fb0148772ed03785c
[12:42:21] <rxaviers> found a workaround, use `npm install jquery/download.jqueryui.com` manually
[12:47:22] <rxaviers> hm not quite, I forgot the version I want is not on master
[12:49:05] <rxaviers> ah! I will simply tarball my local installed stuff and copy to the server for now.
[12:49:26] <rxaviers> installed stuff = my local `npm install download.jqueryui.com`
