[10:54:14] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: Pong!
[10:55:10] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[10:55:21] <gabrielschulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8068#issuecomment-121004441 ...
[10:55:30] <arschmitz> yeah i was just reading that
[10:55:33] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[10:55:50] <gabrielschulhof> So, I can get rid of .delegate(), but I don't think I can use this._on()
[10:56:27] <gabrielschulhof> In fact, I'm trying to be more precise by recording the function that I set as the handler in an instance variable, so I can detach exactly that function later.
[10:56:53] <gabrielschulhof> ... and I'm not sure how many people out there actually override those option names.
[10:57:10] <arschmitz> the way those options work seems kinda insane
[10:57:18] <arschmitz> but oh well yeah just switch to on
[10:57:18] <gabrielschulhof> Wait a sec! Maybe those options are not documented.
[10:57:45] <arschmitz> i didnt even remember we had them
[10:58:09] <gabrielschulhof> Yaaaay! They're not documented!
[10:58:16] <gabrielschulhof> They're sooooo gone!
[10:58:35] <arschmitz> sweet
[11:06:04] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I think I'll keep/document closeLinkSelector, because that's actually useful. It lets you specify which element in the popup, when clicked, should cause the popup to be closed in the absence of history.
