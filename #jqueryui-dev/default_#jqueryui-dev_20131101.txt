[05:51:18] <uGoMobi> morning

[05:51:38] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6685 by mattdemps (15h 46m ago): Solo Grid Margin Issue
[05:51:46] <arschmitz> im curious the use case for a solo grid?
[05:51:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that panel issue looks like a regression :(
[05:52:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: does not make sense to me why you would use this?
[05:53:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: grid solo is only meant to align a single button with multiple buttons in a grid row
[05:53:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: buttons in grids get margin left/right
[05:56:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm seems weird espically since it requires a wrapper
[05:57:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: well, that's what went wrong... we had one demo without ui-block-a wrapper and one with
[05:57:54] <uGoMobi> in the docs we use a wrapper, and that's also consistent with ui-grid-a/b/c/d
[05:58:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: seems like this should just be a demo
[05:58:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: why?
[05:58:53] <arschmitz> because its not a gird if it has one element
[05:59:00] <arschmitz> and it adds a lot of markup complexity
[05:59:55] <uGoMobi> not more complex than the other grids, exactly the same
[06:00:12] <arschmitz> right but other girds have a use
[06:00:18] <arschmitz> they align their children
[06:00:57] <arschmitz> a single element that just needs margins adjusted
[06:01:11] <arschmitz> should not need to use a whole grid system
[06:01:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: grid solo has use too... http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/78/edit
[06:02:03] <uGoMobi> well I could put the whole grid CSS in a demo
[06:02:17] <uGoMobi> all it does is set float left and % width
[06:04:46] <uGoMobi> when that commit has been reverted it's only about one extra selector (.ui-grid-solo) in the CSS
[06:05:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: why wouldnt you just do?
[06:05:02] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/79/edit
[06:05:36] <arschmitz> then no need to any grid action with the element you want to align to the gird no wrappers 
[06:12:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: of course you can also just add a rule to your custom CSS
[06:13:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but maybe people that are not good with CSS find it convenient
[06:13:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: even if we added to frame work i just dont think a solo grids make sense
[06:14:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe you shouldn't look at it as "grid", just a CSS framework feature to align stuff
[06:15:07] <uGoMobi> we didn't add it now, it has been there from the beginning
[06:15:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i understand its always been there does not mean it makes sense though
[06:16:17] <arschmitz> and why would we require it to be placed into a grid like setup with a wrapper if it can be done with a single class on the actual element
[06:16:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you can't set it on button elements because they have width 100%
[06:17:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what do you mean i did in that jsbin
[06:17:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: grids get 100% width too?
[06:17:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that was an anchor element, not a button element
[06:19:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what id different with the button and anchor?
[06:20:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: display block doesn't make a button element 100% width
[06:20:42] <arschmitz> oh
[06:20:55] <uGoMobi> so you have to set width 100%
[06:21:21] <rmcdaniel> _|Nix|_: what do you mean by "full screen toolbars"
[06:22:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so this proofs why it is convenient for people that we offer something to give single buttons the same margin
[06:22:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so they don't have to strugle with CSS
[06:22:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yea i guess 
[06:23:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so it's up to them to use the wrapper and grid solo class or add custom CSS
[06:29:00] <arschmitz> yea

[08:51:01] <gnarf> uGoMobi: I think you could put an index.php that requires ../index.php
[08:51:08] <gnarf> and fix that
[08:51:24] <gnarf> the new server handles it: http://stage.jquerymobile.com/resources/
[08:51:36] <gnarf> but it does that in nginx
[08:51:41] <gnarf> the old website is on apache
[08:51:51] <gnarf> so i'm hoping the index.php trick works
[08:51:56] <gnarf> easiest :)
[08:53:31] <uGoMobi> gnarf: ok, thanks
[09:09:42] <uGoMobi> gnarf: now I think of it, I would need to deploy to add that index.php file... doesn't that mean that the new site goes live while it isn't ready yet?
[09:10:31] <gnarf> uGoMobi you don't want it on the new site
[09:10:35] <gnarf> you want it on the old site
[09:10:44] <uGoMobi> gnarf: yes, exactly
[09:10:44] <gnarf> the new site handles it already
[09:11:14] <uGoMobi> gnarf: but how do i get it on the old site only?
[09:13:06] <gnarf> uGoMobi: i just copied the index.php from the root and changed the path to wordpress: http://jquerymobile.com/resources/
[09:13:18] <gnarf> it can just be an untracked file on the old server

[14:08:23] <rmcdaniel> _|Nix|_: http://jsfiddle.net/59XDP/2/ it seems to work 
[14:14:17] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Those are fullscreen?
[14:14:26] <rmcdaniel> yes

[14:17:26] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Seems to work ... 
[14:18:02] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Also, not to impose or anything, but would you mind using jsbin.com instead of jsfiddle? I find it 1.0e6 times easier to use ...
[14:18:10] <rmcdaniel> sure thing
[14:19:16] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: hmmm ... interesting ... I wouldn't mind tracing this ...
[14:19:38] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: So, all you did was get rid of this._setOptions() from _makeFixed(), eh?
[14:19:43] <rmcdaniel> yes
[14:21:49] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Oh, it works because toolbar also calls _setOptions() from _create()
[14:21:52] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Oh, man!
[14:22:57] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: So, actually, as it stands, we can get rid of _create() out of fixedToolbar altogether.
[14:26:14] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: So, your mission, should you choose to accept it, just got bigger: In addition to making sure that widgets/fixedToolbar.js doesn't call _setOptions() from its _create() either directly or indirectly, you must also change widgets/toolbar.js so /it/ no longer calls _setOptions() from _create(), while ensuring that the inital option values for both regular toolbars and fixed toolbars are honoured during the toolbar's creation.
[14:26:47] * _|Nix|_ gasps for air after that mouthful
[14:27:38] <rmcdaniel> alright I can do that
[14:28:09] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Awesome!
[14:30:23] <rmcdaniel> sounds like I'll need to make quite a few tests
[14:31:14] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: Well, first and foremost of all you must make sure existing tests pass.
[14:31:34] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: ... because you're doing a lot of refactoring, you must be sure that the new code is equivalent to the old code.
[14:32:02] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: ... and if it's not getting tested enough (which is likely), you must add those tests.
[14:32:47] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: IINM, we're especially weak on testing whether option setting works correctly, because we haven't cared too much for .widgetname( "option", "key", newValue ) up until recently.
[14:33:50] <_|Nix|_> rmcdaniel: And we didn't have time to go through toolbars to make sure option setting works correctly. arschmitz has already done a great deal of refactoring on toolbars just to get them into the general widget mould.
