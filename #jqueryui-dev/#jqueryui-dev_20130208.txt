[05:09:06] <talktokets> How can we give transition effects to butttons and view them in android mobile ?
[05:11:56] <mvta> hey guy, does anybody know something about Javascript file templates for phpStorm?ø
[05:56:48] <scott_gonzalez> mvta: That not an appropriate question for this channel.
[05:57:57] <mvta> sorry scott_gonzalez 
[05:59:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf, jzaefferer, everyone else: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-tools
[06:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> Let me know if there are any other data you've wanted git to expose at some point.
[06:00:42] <scott_gonzalez> The goal is to build a set of tools that can be used to easily build new git methods or other scripts.
[06:02:59] <rxaviers> interesting
[06:48:41] <agcolom> rxaviers: quick message: on FF 15 Ubuntu, I also get the white footer on the api docs.
[06:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: We're not concerned about Firefox 15.
[06:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's 3 versions old. Nobody should be using it.
[06:49:58] <agcolom> ok... (This is what we have in our Unix lab) 
[06:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[06:50:38] <scott_gonzalez> They should probably keep the auto-update turned on or use ESR releases.
[06:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, even ESR is up to 17 now.
[06:51:42] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/faq/
[07:17:07] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: You assigned yourself to http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8792, but I'm not sure if you planned on fixing it.
[07:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> You probably assigned it to yourself to review the PR.
[07:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> But the PR was rejected.
[07:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> We have a ton of duplicates of this though.
[07:18:18] <scott_gonzalez> And http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9041 is related.
[07:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/bae06d2b seemed pretty responsive before, maybe we should ping him and see if he can look into those bugs?
[07:22:06] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: good idea. I'll mention that to them
[07:22:55] <rxaviers> agcolom, thanks
[12:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> HEY GUYS
[12:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers gnarf tj_vantoll petersendidit mikesherov DaveMethvin rworth rxaviers
[12:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> What do people think of closing all IE7 CSS bugs as patcheswelcome.
[12:45:57] <DaveMethvin> if it hasn't been fixed by now, it ain't getting fixed
[12:46:11] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We have new bugs getting filed against IE7 :-)
[12:46:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah, us too
[12:46:40] <scott_gonzalez> But yesterdsay when you were responding to the Firefox 3.6 guy, I saw that IE7 had lower global usage than IE6.
[12:46:40] <DaveMethvin> but they tend to be even more esoteric cases
[12:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> Which I did not realize.
[12:46:55] <DaveMethvin> oh that's just sad
[12:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> What was that site you were using for stats?
[12:47:47] <DaveMethvin> gott afind it again
[12:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> w3counter says IE7 has higher market share: http://www.w3counter.com/trends
[12:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> 6^
[12:49:02] <scott_gonzalez> 6%
[12:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&qpcustomd=0
[12:50:11] <DaveMethvin> http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version_partially_combined-ww-monthly-201302-201302-bar
[12:50:12] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's the one you linked to.
[12:50:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah statcounter must lump it in other
[12:50:42] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:51:04] <tj_vantoll> I'm in favor of the change.  Frankly we have more important things to be working on than fixing crazy IE7 hasLayout bugs.  If the community wants to fix then great.
[12:51:04] <tj_vantoll> That being said I think it would still be worth "bad" bugs that for a common use case.
[12:51:12] <DaveMethvin> regardless they're all getting to be pretty small numbers
[12:51:23] <DaveMethvin> and if someone ELSE wants to track down and fix that's fine
[12:51:32] <DaveMethvin> but do any of us want to do this?
[12:51:41] <DaveMethvin> better to close them i think
[12:51:55] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:51:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to do that.
[12:52:06] <rworth> sounds good
[12:52:20] <tj_vantoll> Wow the grammar for my last sentence is pretty horrible.
[12:52:54] <tj_vantoll> Basically I don't think we should be fixing IE7 CSS issues unless they're very badly broken.
[12:52:55] <DaveMethvin> tj_vantoll: patchwelcome :)
[12:53:01] <tj_vantoll> :)
[12:53:28] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: If we have a legit fix, I'm fine landing the fix.
[12:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> As long as we document it with a comment.
[12:53:46] <scott_gonzalez> But for things that we don't have a legit fix for, I want them closed.
[12:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> Basically, I just want them all closed :-P
[12:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> But if we *can* fix them, I think we should.
[12:54:00] <tj_vantoll> CLOSE ALL THE THINGS
[12:54:09] <tj_vantoll> Yeah +1
[12:55:12] <scott_gonzalez> "At this point, we're not going to invest any more time into searching for a workaround that we're comfortable implementing. If anyone has a proposed fix, we'll gladly review a pull request."
[12:56:27] <tj_vantoll> Sounds good.
[13:00:13] <scott_gonzalez> I closed the two that came in recently. At some point I'll review the others.
[13:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> There are only 15 open tickets that have IE7 in the description.
[13:01:53] <tj_vantoll> I can take a look tonight.
[13:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be great.
[13:03:21] <petersendidit> i have 15% of the app I work on still on IE7
[13:03:35] <petersendidit> though 95% of all users use IE so its a weird app
[13:25:26] <scott_gonzalez> A lot of these IE7 bugs have workarounds that aren't too bad for individual sites.
[13:25:36] <scott_gonzalez> But they're usually things we can't or shouldn't do directly in the plugin.

[19:06:05] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez That's about all the IE7 closable issues.  I was torn about http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5254 so I left it open for now.  Leaning towards just closing it though.
[20:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Yeah, I was thinking about that ticket earlier too.
[20:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's a good idea to keep that open for now just because it's fairly core to the plugin.
[20:28:49] <scott_gonzalez> As opposed to the cases like "When I put a table inside a tab panel, this whacky thing happens, but I can fix t."
[20:29:39] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, makes sense.
