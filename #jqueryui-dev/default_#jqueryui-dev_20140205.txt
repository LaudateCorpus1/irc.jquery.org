[06:41:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[06:42:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks
[06:42:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/pull/51#issuecomment-34179786 
[06:42:47] <uGoMobi> Thanks for reviewing
[06:42:55] <uGoMobi> I am not sure though
[06:43:38] <uGoMobi> The changelog has been out in the open for a while
[06:44:08] <uGoMobi> So I think that when you change something you should make visible what you change
[06:45:33] <uGoMobi> Otherwise it might be confusing for users that they are sure they saw something about a deprecated slider widget somewhere but can't find it anymore
[06:46:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can also add that we've changed our minds about the (range)?slider deprecation when we release 1.4.1.
[06:47:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Looked at https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/pull/50 ... it's good AFAICT ...
[06:48:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think that when people upgrade from 1.3 to 1.4 they only check the 1.4.0 changelog
[06:49:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Or do you mean mentioning it in the blog post or something?
[06:49:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not sure i agree for one thats what version control is for
[06:50:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what do you mean?
[06:50:54] <arschmitz> and  websites change all the time and you rarely see any notice of it
[06:50:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks for reviewing
[06:51:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the website is in git
[06:53:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you mean they can check the history of the changelog in git?
[06:53:17] <arschmitz> yes
[06:53:26] <arschmitz> but why they would want to im not sure

[06:53:58] <arschmitz> the changelog is a document to help upgrading why would you want to have inaccurate info in there at any time

[06:54:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you don't want that
[06:54:37] <arschmitz> what does it help by keeping it there then?
[06:54:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but strike through is a common way to show people that you changed something after you already published
[06:55:10] <uGoMobi> you often see it in blog posts too
[06:55:22] <gseguin> arschmitz: could you review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7030 ?
[06:55:29] <arschmitz> gseguin: yup
[06:56:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but a changelog is an upgrade document its not a post
[06:56:18] <arschmitz> it has no author
[06:58:13] <arschmitz> its not the same and its normally dont there because its an article about someone or something else and they accidently gave false information and they need to cite the mistake
[06:58:44] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see any reason to keep it in.
[06:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> I think it'll just confuse people that are seeing it for the first time.
[06:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> Most people don't upgrade right away.
[07:00:06] <arschmitz> and i think at worst you get someone that goes back to check it and its gone and they are like " man i swear that was there yesterday!... oh well must be going crazy moving on..."
[07:01:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that was what I wanted to prevent
[07:01:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right and i dont think thats a big deal i think its more confusing to keep it
[07:01:28] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:01:31] <uGoMobi> I'll remove it

[14:03:18] <gseguin> arschmitz: yop ?
[14:03:40] <gseguin> arschmitz: sorry it seems like znc or freenode was down for a moment
[14:14:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: gseguin: if either of you are still here can you look at two prs im sick of seeing demo issues for the date picker demo lol
[14:15:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: didn't I already comment on your datepicker PR?
[14:15:16] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/demos.jquerymobile.com/pulls
[14:15:37] <arschmitz> just asking about the tag vs including
[14:15:47] <arschmitz> and we talked about it last week and decided tags make sense
[14:15:54] <arschmitz> but then you never went back
[14:16:01] <uGoMobi> did we?
[14:16:18] <arschmitz> yeah it was durring or after last meeting i believe with _|Nix|_
[14:17:15] <uGoMobi> at first I thought it was only about the link to jQuery UI, didn't realize this was also including code from your repo
[14:18:10] <gseguin> arschmitz: which PRs?
[14:18:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am just saying that in general it's better if our demos don't depend on someone else's repo
[14:19:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: why include code thats not needed for the repo if we can link to a stable source
[14:19:20] <arschmitz> a tag should never change unless the project is gone completly
[14:19:29] <arschmitz> at which point we should have the demo break
[14:19:35] <uGoMobi> right
[14:19:38] <arschmitz> because we shouldnt demo a project that no longer exists
[14:20:34] <uGoMobi> but that would also effect older demos
[14:21:15] <uGoMobi> if you change your GH username next year (just example) our demos are broken from 1.4 until then
[14:22:01] <arschmitz> yeah but all the links in the demo are broken either way so someone cant get to it still so its still useless 
[14:22:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its no differnet then how we depend on geo data for auto complete
[14:22:53] <uGoMobi> that's a good example
[14:23:02] <uGoMobi> I was thinking about that one too
[14:23:15] <uGoMobi> I am not saying we should never do it
[14:23:21] <uGoMobi> just try to avoid it
[14:24:07] <arschmitz> i just dont think it makes sense to commit external files to the repo only for a demo
[14:25:05] <uGoMobi> the amount of people reporting that broken datepicker demo tells us how important they are
[14:25:20] <uGoMobi> so I wouldn't say "only a demo"
[14:25:45] <uGoMobi> anyway, maybe it's just me
[14:25:54] <arschmitz> gseguin: any oppinion here?
[14:26:03] * gseguin is catching up
[14:26:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: basicly for a demo that uses an external script from another lib
[14:26:45] <arschmitz> commit to the lib in demos or just link to a tag?
[14:26:47] <arschmitz> on github
[14:28:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and remember because demos is its own repo we can actually fix demo issues on old version if they are reported now 
[14:29:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's true
[14:29:47] <uGoMobi> it would only stay broken in the downloaded zips
[14:30:11] <uGoMobi> that's another thing, the idea was that you could browse the demos offline
[14:30:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if enough people complained those could be generated again and fixed too
[14:30:28] <uGoMobi> (I know that the autocomplete won't work)
[14:31:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: how often do you think someone does that and does not have internet access?
[14:31:18] <uGoMobi> almost never
[14:31:20] <arschmitz> thats more so that you dont need a server with appache
[14:31:26] <uGoMobi> just saying it was the idea
[14:31:27] <arschmitz> then for connectivity

[14:32:54] <uGoMobi> maybe it sounds like I make a big deal of a small thing but I can't remember a single release without something broken in the demos
[14:33:04] <uGoMobi> there are always problems with them
[14:33:39] <arschmitz> well thats because we have made huge changes every time
[14:33:43] <uGoMobi> so that's why I'd like to prevent those problems as much as possible
[14:33:53] <uGoMobi> true
[14:34:10] <uGoMobi> but still it would be nice if we can prevent them instead of fix them
[14:34:14] <arschmitz> we keep change the entire directory structure

[14:36:49] <gseguin> I don't understand what the issue is
[14:37:12] * gseguin may not have drank ennough coffee today
[14:37:13] <arschmitz> based on absolutly nothing i think german wit bier's promote productivity
[14:37:15] <uGoMobi> gseguin: inlcude external code in demos or link to it
[14:37:33] <gseguin> oh
[14:37:40] <uGoMobi> include even
[14:37:46] <arschmitz> gseguin: if a demo relys on an external script from another repo should we commit it or just link to a tag on github
[14:37:50] <gseguin> are you referring to the backbone sample 
[14:38:03] <uGoMobi> nope
[14:38:05] <arschmitz> not specificly but that would apply
[14:38:12] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:38:15] <arschmitz> as that should match what ever we decide 
[14:38:43] <gseguin> should we use bower and bowerfor it?
[14:38:51] <gseguin> *bowercopy
[14:39:18] <arschmitz> gseguin: personally i would prefer linking to a tag
[14:39:30] <arschmitz> it seems like a waste to commit external code for a single demo page
[14:40:05] <FJ1> hi guys. have you noted the styling problem with 1.10.4?
[14:40:05] <FJ1> 1.10.3:
[14:40:05] <FJ1> http://jsfiddle.net/FlasJunior/zfEAQ/7/ looks ok
[14:40:05] <FJ1> 1.10.4:
[14:40:06] <FJ1> http://jsfiddle.net/FlasJunior/zfEAQ/6 :-/
[14:40:07] <FJ1> you can also see it if you use google cdn:
[14:40:07] <FJ1> http://jsfiddle.net/FlasJunior/zfEAQ/5/
[14:40:08] <FJ1> http://jsfiddle.net/FlasJunior/zfEAQ/4
[14:40:09] <FJ1> and of cores on jquery ui website in all examples:
[14:40:09] <FJ1> http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[14:40:16] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'm not sure what you mean by "linking to a tag"
[14:40:23] <uGoMobi> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/demos.jquerymobile.com/commit/2c39b901f397e4b3c48e03d62562bc97233208b7#diff-21e37c197dc3cd4604e68af65d3c0a82R11
[14:40:58] <arschmitz> gseguin: https://rawgithub.com/jquery/jquery-ui/1.10.4/ui/jquery.ui.datepicker.js
[14:41:07] <gseguin> oh because you want the demos to work locally without to run npm install
[14:41:10] <gseguin> got it!
[14:41:18] <arschmitz> thats a file in a tag so it will never change as long as the repo jquery-ui exists
[14:41:50] <arschmitz> gseguin: right
[14:42:15] <gseguin> that looks good to me
[14:42:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I was more talking about https://rawgithub.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile-datepicker-wrapper/v0.1.1/jquery.mobile.datepicker.css ( a non jQuery repo)
[14:43:23] <uGoMobi> and of course in general, shouldn't make a difference if it's your repo or someone else
[14:43:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah we mentioned the backbone one too also non jquery
[14:45:30] <uGoMobi> I have to look at that backbone demo again but that demo in general annoys me because it's broken all the time
[14:45:44] <uGoMobi> at first it was using an old jQuery core version I think
[14:45:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats because we keep breaking it with changes
[14:45:58] <uGoMobi> then we changed the use same core as rest of the demos
[14:47:38] <gseguin> I agree to not have moving target especially for "external" demos
[14:48:22] <arschmitz> gseguin: right but what do you think is the best way to do that tag or commit?
[14:48:37] <gseguin> tag if there is one
[14:48:43] <gseguin> commit otherwise
[14:48:48] <arschmitz> ok
[14:49:00] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:49:01] <arschmitz> i 100% agree with that
[14:49:13] <gseguin> most of the projects we use are using semver tagging too
[14:49:32] <gseguin> if not all of them
[14:49:48] <arschmitz> gseguin: yup and we should probably reconsider using something if there is not even a tag of it yet
[14:50:08] <arschmitz> its probably not to a point where we should spend time demoing it 
[14:52:40] <arschmitz> gseguin: uGoMobi: think one of you could ive the +1 to these so we can get this fixed? https://github.com/jquery/demos.jquerymobile.com/pull/5 && https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7040
[14:53:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[14:53:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thanks
[14:55:02] <arschmitz> gseguin: thanks
[14:57:19] <FJ1> Has anybody time for my problem with jquery ui 1.10.4 theme?
[14:57:21] <FJ1> 1.10.3:
[14:57:21] <FJ1> http://jsfiddle.net/FlasJunior/zfEAQ/7/ looks ok
[14:57:21] <FJ1> 1.10.4:
[14:57:22] <FJ1> http://jsfiddle.net/FlasJunior/zfEAQ/6 :-/
[14:57:29] <uGoMobi> For the record... I am still not convinced that this is the right way but we dicussed and I'll follow the majority. Maybe we'll discuss it again with UI some time.
[15:00:44] <gseguin> FJ1: This is the developer channel. For support please use #jquery
[15:03:23] <uGoMobi> FJ1: If you mean the darker background... looks like the PNG image has changed. I don't know if that was intentional.
[15:04:06] <FJ1> @uGoMobil yes, thats what i mean.
[15:04:07] <uGoMobi> I guess not since it's a point release
[15:05:24] <uGoMobi> FJ1: I don't see any recent changes here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/master/themes/base/images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_75_cccccc_1x100.png
[15:08:18] <FJ1> @uGoMobii but if you compare http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/themes/smoothness/images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_75_cccccc_1x100.png with http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.4/themes/smoothness/images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_75_cccccc_1x100.png you can see it
[15:10:17] <uGoMobi> FJ1: yes, so this seems to be a bug
[15:10:52] <uGoMobi> FJ1: Can you report it here http://bugs.jqueryui.com/newticket
[15:14:41] <FJ1> @uGoMobi i don't have a login :-/
[15:15:24] <FJ1> here a compair: http://jsfiddle.net/FlasJunior/zfEAQ/8/
[15:24:06] <FJ1> or http://jsfiddle.net/FlasJunior/zfEAQ/9/
[15:28:08] <uGoMobi> FJ1: You can register to get a login (see link at the right top)
[15:30:56] <FJ1> ok. sec.
