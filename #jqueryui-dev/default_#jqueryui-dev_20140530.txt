[12:36:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we used the 1.5-2.0 milestone to mark (closed) feature requests that we probably want to work on
[12:36:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but we abuse that milestone
[12:37:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: shall I delete that milestone and add high priority label instead?
[12:37:38] <arschmitz> only add high priority if it really is
[12:38:10] <arschmitz> for the rest just tag them feature request
[12:38:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok I will double check but you and I selected those feature requests when working on the roadmap

[13:37:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[13:37:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[13:37:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Looking at https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/173
[13:38:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is the reason why switching from a default icon colour of "White" to one of "Blac" has no effect on 1.4.x the fact that we now switch back and forth via the class ui-alt-icon?
[13:38:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess I'm asking if we need to remove that dropdown for 1.4.x.
[13:38:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am looking
[13:39:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I looked at the icons demos, and the way you get black icons is by adding ui-alt-icon to the parent of the container wherein the icons are to be black.
[13:40:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: correct
[13:40:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we changed the class name in 1.4
[13:40:36] <uGoMobi> from ui-icon-alt to ui-alt-icon
[13:40:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK. In 1.3.2 it was ui-icon-alt.
[13:40:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so the TR code may be applying the old class.
[13:40:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll go check.
[13:40:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, could be
[13:41:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: w/ or w/o disc works though
[13:41:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we changed that class as well
[13:44:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Neither the default nor the start theme for 1.4.x contains the key global-icon-set
[13:44:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: find jqm -type f | xargs grep -niH global-icon-set
[13:45:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This find "global-icon-set" in every starter and default theme, except 1.4.x.
[13:45:20] <uGoMobi> hmm
[13:45:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, either the comment is missing, or the way we choose between black/white icons has changed.
[13:47:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe this has something to do with the introduction of grunticon.
[13:48:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, in 1.4.2, we have a separate jquery.mobile.icons.min.css.
[13:48:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see we handle the disc with global-icon-disc which sets the background to transparent
[13:49:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think it is caused by a missing icon CSS file
[13:50:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, but the comment /*{global-icon-set}*/ was next to the icons themselves, i.e., next to background-image: url(images/icons-18-white.png);
[13:50:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: both the white and the black icons are in the same CSS
[13:50:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that's the problem
[13:50:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, but that CSS is no longer theme.css, but icons.css.
[13:51:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I don't believe we dump icons.css into the styleblock in TR.
[13:51:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so the only solution is to swap the icon CSS file
[13:52:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How do you mean "swap"?
[13:52:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ui-icon-* is the white icon and ui-icon-*-alt is the black icon
[13:53:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sorry, I am wrong
[13:54:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: .ui-icon-alt .ui-icon-* is the black icon
[13:55:21] <_|Nix|_> OK, so what exactly is the meaning of that dropdown? Does it mean to set the default icon colour for a theme?
[13:55:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so if you want to change that without the need to use to add that class in your markup, we have to swap the icon CSS file for a version where it is the other way around
[13:55:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not for a theme, but globally
[13:56:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I didn't mean for a swatch, I meant for all the swatches in a theme.
[13:56:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, misunderstood
[13:56:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then the answer is yes
[13:57:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so, lemme get this straight: If the value inside the dropdown is "Black", then .ui-icon-* gives you a black icon, and .ui-alt-icon .ui-icon-* gives you a white icon. Correct?
[13:57:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: correct
[13:57:46] <_|Nix|_> OK. So, we need to generate the icons.css file as well.
[13:58:11] <_|Nix|_> Currently, the icons.css file is completely inert. We just pass it along everywhere.
[13:58:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, but the fact that we use 3 icon files (inline SVG, data-uri PNG, PNG) makes it even more complicated
[13:59:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but the procedure is the same. Remove .ui-alt-icon from in front of all the icons that had it, and put it in front of all the icons that didn't have it.
[13:59:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we only include the default icon CSS (inline SVG + PNG combined) in the TR zip
[14:01:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: also looking at this one https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/161
[14:02:25] <uGoMobi> because all those icon CSS files are not on the CDN I download the zip after release and add the icon CSS manually when updating the TR
[14:02:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  and then there is https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/160
[14:02:52] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see.
[14:03:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure what we should do with this global icon color issue
[14:03:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/160 ... do you mean we should append the icon CSS to the end of the theme styleblock?
[14:04:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because we decided not to invest to much time in the TR since we are going to replace it with a new one for 2.0
[14:04:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I would say create a second styleblock for icons, search and replace whenever the value of the dropdown changes, and write out the second styleblock just like we write out the first.
[14:04:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that does sound like a solution
[14:05:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: will be a huge style block
[14:05:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, but that's still pretty far off, I wager, during which time users will complain: https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/173#issuecomment-43706581
[14:05:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I saw the comment
[14:06:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not saying we shouldn't fix bugs
[14:07:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but the idea that just adding class ui-alt-icon to the body element gives you the exact same result made we wonder if we shouldn't just tell people to do that
[14:08:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and we can keep the dropdown so people can see how it looks 
[14:09:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, no. The correct way would be to remove the dropdown and include a section with alternative icons in the preview.
[14:10:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... because the UI on the left makes modifications to the contents of the theme. We don't want to mess with those semantics.
[14:10:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that might even be better
[14:13:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... I guess the way we have been handling alternative icons in the past is the same as we are doing in 1.4.2 - namely to add ui-alt-icon (or ui-icon-alt, as it was previously known) to either the element we wish to affect, or to the parent of those elements we wish to affect.
[14:13:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, the difference is we used a sprite so we only had to change background image url's
[14:14:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But I guess we can say that, as of 1.4.x we no longer provide the ability for editing the rules governing which colour needs the ui-alt-icon class and which one doesn't.
[14:14:33] <uGoMobi> although, if I am not mistaken, we had issues with this in the TR with previous versions as well
[14:14:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Instead, we show you both in the preview, and you already know from previous versions that, if you want alternative icons, you just add ui-alt-icon.
[14:16:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I think we should do that
[14:16:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can keep the disc / no-disc
[14:16:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, because that's not icon-specific. It's in the theme CSS file.
[14:17:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yup
[14:17:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is a small bug there though
[14:17:28] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, this way is certainly easier than the alternative.
[14:17:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's a bug with modifying the disc?
[14:17:56] <uGoMobi> we use a fallback for browsers that don't support RGBA
[14:18:15] <uGoMobi> when you set no-disc we don't set that fallback to transparent as well
[14:18:40] <uGoMobi> I think we can fix that by adding the same key in a comment in the theme CSS file
[14:19:06] <_|Nix|_> Are there any supported browsers left that don't support RGBA?
[14:19:14] <_|Nix|_> Can you file an issue?
[14:19:43] <_|Nix|_> You can even copy your last 3 comments into it.
[14:20:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just looked at the theme CSS and this won't fix it
[14:21:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then I guess we need to special-case that key.
[14:23:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I think we use the wrong key in the comment
[14:23:47] <uGoMobi> global-icon-color vs. global-icon-disc
[14:25:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I'll open a ticket in the applicable repo as soon as it's clear if it's an issue in the TR or in the theme CSS
[14:31:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome! You're the expert!
