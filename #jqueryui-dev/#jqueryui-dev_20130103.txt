Add aria-live to announce changes in JAWS/Firefox while menu is closed. Remove aria-labelledby as the label element is now the label. Still terrible in IE9/JAWS, way better with Safari/VoiceOver.

[07:53:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm going to miss the testing meeting. We're stopping for food right now (driving to NY).
[07:54:35] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: ah, too bad. Looks like Timo won't be around either. While you're online, maybe you can open/fetch this and take a look: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/368
[07:55:08] <jzaefferer> I'll be there - if no one shows up, we can discuss stuff in two weeks
[07:55:47] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: also greetings to Mike and Petro - sounded like you're going to meet them later or tomorrow
[07:56:42] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure about Petro. Mike's not in the office today.
[07:56:52] <petro> Meet where?
[07:57:38] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe my house? Not sure if I'll have a car to get to Mike's.
[07:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, my parent's house, not mine :-P
[07:58:02] <scott_gonzalez> My parents live in Roslyn Heights.
[10:48:32] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: quick question if you have a moment
[10:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[10:48:54] <mikesherov> so I'm working on the jquery color bug
[10:49:15] <mikesherov> line 581 seems to be the problem of jquery.color.js in the jquery-color repo
[10:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> checking
[10:50:00] <mikesherov> we do this whole conversion from the supplied value to an rgba string
[10:50:28] <mikesherov> and in there, we do: if ( !support.rgba && value._rgba[ 3 ] !== 1 ) {
[10:50:39] <mikesherov> and this catches IE7 "transparent"
[10:51:10] <mikesherov> so because it needs to tansform from supplied value into rgba string, it just using the backgroundColor of the parent
[10:51:17] <scott_gonzalez> 581 for me is: if ( jQuery.type( value ) !== "string" || ( parsed = stringParse( value ) ) ) {
[10:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah, I see the other conditional.
[10:51:28] <mikesherov> right, that's the conditional that does the conversion
[10:51:44] <mikesherov> the question is, what if I changed: if ( jQuery.type( value ) !== "string" || ( parsed = stringParse( value ) ) ) {
[10:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> So, my question is why are we hooking .css() at all?
[10:51:53] <mikesherov> to: if ( value !== "transparent" && ( jQuery.type( value ) !== "string" || ( parsed = stringParse( value ) )  ) ) {
[10:52:16] <mikesherov> sure, my sentiments exactly
[10:52:24] <mikesherov> I was going to get there
[10:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> When this code only existed in UI, all we hooked into was animations.
[10:52:49] <mikesherov> it seems to me we're trying to fake a blend mode?
[10:53:08] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we should be doing that in .css()
[10:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery.Color() already provides APIs for blending colors.
[10:53:35] <mikesherov> oh wait, no
[10:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> I think users will be confused if .css() is setting colors other than what they're actually specifying.
[10:53:48] <mikesherov> it's so you can specify rgba values for IE7
[10:53:55] <mikesherov> which doesn't support rgba
[10:54:36] <scott_gonzalez> And it doesn't support background-color: transparent?
[10:54:45] <mikesherov> Right
[10:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> I find that part hard to beleve.
[10:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> Isnt' the problem 596?
[10:55:40] <mikesherov> no
[10:55:53] <mikesherov> it's either this: 					if ( !support.rgba && value._rgba[ 3 ] !== 1 ) {
[10:56:03] <mikesherov> or: if ( value !== "transparent" && ( jQuery.type( value ) !== "string" || ( parsed = stringParse( value ) )  ) ) {
[10:56:22] <mikesherov> we could either circumvent the rgba conversion for "transparent" completely
[10:57:08] <mikesherov> or we can say if ( !support.rgba && value._rgba[ 3 ] !== 1 &&  value._rgba[ 3 ] !== 0 ) {
[10:57:16] <mikesherov> and then don't convert to rgba
[10:57:40] <mikesherov> I think the hooked check should be avoided for alpha-less color values
[10:57:47] <mikesherov> meaning either solid or transparent
[10:58:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, skipping for alpha = 0|1 seems good.
[10:58:57] <mikesherov> but then we also need to avoid the conversion to rgba, so we need to retain original value
[10:59:44] <mikesherov> we can use .toString() instead of .toRgbaString() and that solves it too
[10:59:58] <mikesherov> toString: function() {
[10:59:58] <mikesherov> 		return this._rgba[ 3 ] === 0 ? "transparent" : this.toRgbaString();
[10:59:59] <mikesherov> 	}
[11:00:42] <scott_gonzalez> That works.
[11:01:19] <mikesherov> ok, patching now
[11:01:22] <mikesherov> thanks for the help
[11:01:28] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[11:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I'm on Belt Pwky right now.
[11:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> But I need to stop at my uncle's house in Port Washington first.
[11:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> He's leaving for Arizona in 2 hours and wants to see us before he leaves.
[11:03:50] <mikesherov> OK, when are you in Roslyn Heights?
[11:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> We'll probably be there by 4:00p, staying till Sunday.
[11:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> I wanted to leave earlier this morning, but the kids made that impossible :-P
[11:05:14] <mikesherov> yup
[11:05:32] <mikesherov> OK, so I have a phone call with my team at 5:30PM
[11:05:38] <mikesherov> but other than that, I'm wide open
[11:07:04] <scott_gonzalez> My mom should be home from work by the time we get to the house, so I should be able to use her car. So we can meet at your house or mine.
[11:09:12] <mikesherov> I can come to you
[11:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:22:04] <mikesherov> so, I just pushed the fix to jquery-color
[11:22:16] <mikesherov> don't know if gnarf needs to cut a new version or what
[11:22:18] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[11:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> We can pull in the code from master.
[11:22:43] <mikesherov> OK, I'll do that now
[11:23:05] <mikesherov> is there a grunt task for that, or is it a copypaste job?
[11:23:15] <scott_gonzalez> copy paste
[11:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> Eventually we'll just pull it in as its own file.
[11:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> But we're not ready for that yet.
[11:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> Requires changes to download builder.
[11:24:11] <mikesherov> OK, do I need to bump version number on color so the comments are correct?
[11:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> You can, or we can just change the comment manually to include a SHA when we paste.
[11:25:36] <mikesherov> OK, that makes sense
[11:25:37] <mikesherov> will do
[11:30:05] <scott_gonzalez> oy
[11:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> "Get on the LIE"
[11:30:25] <scott_gonzalez> "Ok, now what?"
[11:30:38] <scott_gonzalez> "This doesn't look like the LIE. It's looks like Northern State."
[11:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> "It said Eastern LI."
[11:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> "umm...that's not the same as LIE"
[11:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> At least they pretty much run on top of each other over here.
