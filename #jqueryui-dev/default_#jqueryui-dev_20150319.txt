[05:42:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping! IE8 does not support Array.prototype.indexOf()
[05:43:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... which we use in widget.backcompat ... yaaaay :/
[05:43:11] <arschmitz> are we using it somwehre
[05:43:22] <arschmitz> oh ok iv been bad about that writing too much node 
[05:43:30] <arschmitz> just use $.inArray
[05:43:31] <gabriel_schulhof> NP ...
[05:43:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[05:44:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Can I push the change directly to ui-1-12?
[05:44:26] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: odd jshint didnt catch that
[05:44:29] <arschmitz> we have es3 true
[05:44:44] <gabriel_schulhof> That is odd.
[05:44:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah that branch is going to be rebased anyway
[05:44:54] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[05:49:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: jshint may not be able to recognize the fact that we're dealing with a plain array, because we're splitting and assigning variables and stuff.
[05:49:53] <ronnel> Hi, I was interested in the google summer of code for prototyping a JavaScript transition module in jquery mobile, could you point me in a direction i could start?
[05:53:49] <arschmitz> ronnel: i would start by seeing how our current css transitions work, and how jquery core / ui animate and effects work
[05:54:30] <arschmitz> and start thinking about how you would create transitions and a transition module that will fit into our current architecture using the javascript methods instead of css

[07:15:45] <MUHAKH> leobalter: Hi, I want to participate at gsoc "QUnit - Better diff output" project
[07:37:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: How would I use qunit-assert-classes to make sure that the class attribute is empty? I've tried assert.hasClassesStrict( $payload[ 0 ], "", "After destroying on-the-fly popup, the payload has no classes" );
[07:38:06] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and that throws an error.
[07:38:36] <arschmitz> they are you checking the class attribute after destroy
[07:38:42] <arschmitz> you should be just doing a dom equals
[07:39:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, it's because that's why I was doing it.
[07:39:11] <gabriel_schulhof> s/why/how/
[07:39:21] <gabriel_schulhof> I suppose I can switch to dom-equals.
[07:39:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: destroy tests in general should be as simple as a dom equals call
[07:39:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Nevertheless, calling hasClassesStrict like that throws an exceptions.
[07:39:55] <arschmitz> that verifies everything at once
[07:40:06] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean an exception
[07:40:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hmm yeah im not sure if i want to handle that 
[07:40:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, it's a simple enough case, with a single element.
[07:40:30] <arschmitz> i feel like that should throw
[07:40:46] <arschmitz> but maybe i should add hasNoClass( 
[07:42:59] <arschmitz> in hasClassesStrict the first argument is "classes: a space seperated string of classes" im not sure i would consider an empty string a space seperated string of classes

[09:41:52] <atomiomi> Hi, I'm writing some tests. It is strange problem, when I write 'element.simulate( "mousedown" )' in one test-block another will fail. Can someone tell what is the reason?
[09:54:57] <jzaefferer> atomiomi: difficult to answer without context
[09:55:36] <atomiomi> jzaefferer: I can send you a gist
[09:55:43] <agcolom> arschmitz: Hi Alex, just to let you know that with the new time difference I won't be able to attend today's meeting again, as I will be traveling home. 
[09:55:45] <jzaefferer> atomiomi: tests don't run sandboxed, so its possible for one test to affect others. I don't think I've noticed that specific issue before
[09:55:57] <jzaefferer> you can try .trigger("mousedown")
[10:00:39] <atomiomi> Here is a link: https://gist.github.com/atomiomi/a7dec98d876592f036ab
[10:07:59] <jzaefferer> atomiomi: the only questionable thing I see there is the destroy call, along with creating slider again, in the same test. That should be avoided, though I don't see how that would cause the other test to fail
[10:08:45] <jzaefferer> atomiomi: looking at the original file, that other test is already bad; you shouldn't follow that example
[10:09:10] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: thanks for the input, I'm updating my branch
[10:13:49] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: cool ill try and come up with better suggestions once you do
[10:15:04] <jzaefferer> well, the one I asked for you can already write
[10:15:08] <jzaefferer> I'm not changing that one
