[03:39:32] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[05:00:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[05:06:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was looking at this ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4698
[05:06:28] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #4698 by cannona (12mon 3d ago): Set the ARIA role of button to elements with the data-role="button" attribute
[05:06:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: would be nice if we could have buttonMarkup add that ARIA role
[05:07:35] <uGoMobi> but I am not sure if it's a simple thing or more complex because buttonMarkup only handles classes now
[05:11:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... checking ...
[05:11:54] <uGoMobi> thanks
[05:17:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, we no longer use buttonMarkup ... we've moved to adding ui-btn & Co. by hand.
[05:18:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if we want to add role="button" to all elements that are equivalent to buttonMarkup, we should probably move back to using buttonMarkup and have buttonMarkup add the role.
[05:18:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: huh, we still have buttonMarkup for anchors with data-role="button"
[05:18:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, that's right, that's an autoinit performed by buttonMarkup.
[05:18:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was only thinking about anchors styled as button now
[05:19:08] <uGoMobi> to give them the aria role
[05:19:31] <uGoMobi> I am not completely sure if the button element and input type="button" need it
[05:19:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: even if they do that would just be part of widget
[05:20:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes (and good morning)
[05:20:08] <arschmitz> and good morning uGoMobi _|Nix|_
[05:20:30] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 06checkboxradio: 02http://git.io/JWycHw
[05:20:30] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06checkboxradio 14d24ecd6 15Gabriel Schulhof: Checkboxradio: Get rid of optionDemultiplexer AMD-dependency.
[05:21:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: I think for now the best way would be to add role="button" at each place where it's needed.
[05:21:38] <_|Nix|_> If we decide that data-role="button" links need role="button" then we can add that to the autoinit function present in buttonMarkup, but not to buttonMarkup itself.
[05:22:22] <_|Nix|_> Actually, now that buttonMarkup is just class manipulation, we can document that people should add the role by hand.
[05:22:36] <uGoMobi> true
[05:22:42] <_|Nix|_> So, maybe we don't need any code changes - especially in light of our endeavour to reduce startup DOM manip.
[05:22:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not so sure thats the right approach to accessibility 
[05:23:05] <arschmitz> to leave it to people to handle them selves
[05:23:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I agree - in cases where we introduce DOM that people cannot access, DOM that has specific functions in terms of a11y.
[05:23:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, in the case of links, we introduce no new DOM (anymore).
[05:24:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right but we are still styling it
[05:24:37] <arschmitz> and many people dont know anything about aria
[05:26:12] <uGoMobi> I think I agree with arschmitz, it's still the framework that makes changes (styles) that makes that the ARIA role should be added
[05:27:03] <uGoMobi> and taking care of ARIA roles to some extend is a framework feature
[05:27:46] <uGoMobi> I say +1 to having buttonMarkup add the role
[05:37:20] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[05:38:27] <_|Nix|_> In that case, we should (eventually) unify the addition of this role by moving back to calls to buttonMarkup, which is now vastly simpler, and even has a switch to bypass the expensive class parsing upon first enhancement.
[05:38:50] <_|Nix|_> "expensive" insofar as string manipulation is expensive in JS.
[05:39:19] <_|Nix|_> For now though, I can add it to buttonMarkup and wherever else we need it (dialog close button?)
[05:40:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why should we unify this in buttonMarkup?
[05:41:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: besides dialog close button we have back button, custom select close button, table column toggle button
[05:42:14] <uGoMobi> I think that are all the buttons we generate
[05:43:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, so if we styled them all via .buttonMarkup( {/* options */ }, true /* meaning don't examine existing options */ ) then we would have consistency in the way we add the role.
[05:44:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I dare say no performance impact.
[05:45:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: i don't think we style them with buttonMarkup
[05:45:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, if we were to actually re-introduce a call to .buttonMarkup into the library, we should of course check the performance impact just in case.
[05:45:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we just add the ui-btn class in the widget
[05:45:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, but we used to.
[05:45:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, I am not in favor of reintroducing those calls
[05:46:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I would agree, however, buttonMarkup is no longer just class manipulation.
[05:46:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: just as before it was more than class manipulation.
[05:46:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So now, to achieve consistency, we have to add the role in many places.
[05:47:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the other places are about generated buttons
[05:47:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, AMD-depending on buttonMarkup just to get consistency may increase code size for any custom build, so ...
[05:48:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we could probably just add the role in the markup we append
[05:48:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.

[05:49:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you don't think it's a good idea to have buttonMarkup add this role we can leave it for 15.

[05:49:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is more ARIA stuff we have to look into
[05:50:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm OK with buttonMarkup adding this role.
[05:50:17] <arschmitz> did we previously add the aria role?
[05:50:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't believe so.
[05:50:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and like you said, it is possible to just add the role in your markup
[05:50:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no
[05:51:42] <arschmitz> ok just wanted to make sure this would not be a regression
[05:58:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so what's the definitive list of places where the button role must be added? [âœ“] buttonMarkup (I already added it), [ ] dialog close, [ ] custom select close, [ ] ???
[05:59:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do we have a dialog review branch? It still uses optionDemultiplexer in master ....
[05:59:23] <arschmitz> no
[05:59:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, then I'll make the change in master.
[05:59:38] <arschmitz> dont think we will get to that for 1.4 :(
[05:59:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: table column toggle button
[06:00:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and we have the back button option, but not sure if that uses buttonMarkup() or not
[06:00:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: does it?
[06:02:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  I am not sure about the collapsible heading
[06:02:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... neither am I ....
[06:02:31] <uGoMobi> or if there is a better role for that
[06:02:46] <uGoMobi> so I suggest we look into that for 1.5
[06:02:47] <_|Nix|_> Right ...
[06:02:50] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[06:02:59] <uGoMobi> there is also a ticket about collapsible / ARIA
[06:03:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ask the OP from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4698

[06:03:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or that vick-something guy.
[06:04:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I suggest we add it now where we are sure it shoud be added
[06:05:04] <uGoMobi> I will add ARIA a roadmap item for 1.5
[06:05:12] <uGoMobi> and ask Victor for help
[06:05:59] <uGoMobi> we should also make it configurable if an aria role is added to elements with role="header|footer|content" for example

[06:16:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What about the main select button? to role or not to role?
[06:17:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no role
[06:17:17] <_|Nix|_> Roger
[06:17:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we generate an anchor but the native select is still accessible
[06:18:20] <uGoMobi> so I am not sure what (if any) we need to do there... something for 1.5

[06:19:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, native select is wrapped in a div, whereas custom select is wrapped in an anchor.
[06:19:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, you're right
[06:19:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, no role on either?
[06:20:54] <_|Nix|_> To me, it sounds like custom select should get a role because the native element itself is nowhere to be found.
[06:20:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: native select no, custom select maybe in 1.5
[06:21:00] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[06:21:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it can be found
[06:21:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we position it offscreen but keep it accessible for screen readers
[06:21:30] <uGoMobi> so that's why I am not sure
[06:21:31] <_|Nix|_> Right. Hmmm ...
[06:21:35] <_|Nix|_> GOod point.
[06:21:45] <_|Nix|_> I guess screen readers can just use the native element anyway.
[06:21:58] <uGoMobi> yeah, I think so too
[06:22:30] <_|Nix|_> OK. Good point. So, let's forget about the select main button for now.
[06:22:44] <uGoMobi> yeah, let's ask the experts for 1.5
[06:23:12] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[06:31:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: finally light at the horizon regarding external panels
[06:32:46] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15scottgonzalez closed pull request #1030: Slider: trim value even if it is the min/max. Fixed #9376 - Slider value... (06master...069376_slider)  02http://git.io/N-lxRw
[06:40:14] <_|Nix|_> [âœ“] multiple choice custom select popup close
[06:48:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so the header back button also gets the role, right?
[06:49:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[06:49:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. That's the last remaining one.
[06:49:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: awesome
[06:58:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : if you trigger create event on body would that enhance widgets outside page?
[07:00:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes im pretty sure
[07:00:15] <_|Nix|_> Yes.
[07:00:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: however triggering create is being deprecated 
[07:00:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah that's good to know
[07:00:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah dang that's right
[07:01:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, come to think of it, "create" is another example of a function call achieved via a signal.
[07:01:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bad.
[07:01:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: A function call should be achieved via a function call.
[07:01:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: have not written the replacement function yet but it will be something like $.mobile.enhanceWithin("target");
[07:01:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course, when every widget was listening for it, then it was a different storey.
[07:01:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly why its depracated
[07:01:54] <_|Nix|_> s/storey/story/
[07:02:07] <_|Nix|_> It was a whole 'nother level of bad ;)
[07:02:18] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:02:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so the new way will just be $.mobile.enhanceWithin("body");
[07:03:00] <arschmitz> and basicly the whole dom would be enhanced lol
[07:03:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sounds like good solution
[07:03:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Does toolbar really need to call buttonMarkup?
[07:03:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It does currently.
[07:03:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or is that fixed in a review branch?
[07:03:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no thats from pre next
[07:03:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: toolbar is not reviewed yet
[07:03:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. So, I'll remove that call and just add the class.
[07:03:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll do it on master.
[07:03:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is that for the back button?
[07:04:06] <arschmitz> im going to do toolbar and page hopefully right off here just have not got to it yet
[07:04:12] <uGoMobi> or auto enhance anchors in headers/footers?
[07:04:30] <uGoMobi> which will deprecate ^^
[07:04:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Also, there's no longer a need to .attr( "data-" + $.mobile.ns + "theme", o.backBtnTheme )
[07:04:44] <uGoMobi> s/will/we will/
[07:04:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We agreed that we shan't keep attributes in sync with option values.
[07:05:15] <arschmitz> yup
[07:05:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's another DOM manip we can do without.
[07:20:38] <_|Nix|_> Are there any widget review PRs/branches I should be looking at?
[07:21:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: frequent did a PR for filter widget
[07:21:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[07:21:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that already has been reviewed
[07:22:02] <_|Nix|_> OK.

[07:22:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no it needs to be looked at again

[07:22:23] <_|Nix|_> Can do.
[07:22:27] <uGoMobi> those need to be reviewed
[07:22:28] <arschmitz> there were a lot of updates that it needed

[07:23:29] <frequent> yup. I can't get that test to work...
[07:23:37] <frequent> it passes locally on every browser I tried
[07:23:58] <frequent> arschmitz: all your stuff should be in there
[07:24:16] <arschmitz> frequent: awesome i meant to look at it already but got swamped at work
[07:24:24] <uGoMobi> I think I saw a timeout in that test... maybe increase it?
[07:25:08] <frequent> good idea. have not tried. I'm not really a friend of setTimeout in the tests, but is there another way when using a filter-delay of 250ms?
[07:25:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: any widget review branches that you have been working on that _|Nix|_ can review? (button, flip switch, listview?)
[07:26:04] <uGoMobi> frequent: I think none of us like timeouts ;)

[07:26:45] <uGoMobi> great

[07:29:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I didn't get to changing the a11y CSS yesterday, but I won't forget... should be able to do that today now external panels finally seem to work :)
[07:29:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[07:29:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess when that 3px twitch goes away you know that it is working.
[07:30:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah :)
[07:30:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, it may well be that no amount of a11y tweaking fixes that twitch, in which case we need to come up with something els.

[07:36:18] <arschmitz> yeah works well for me 
[07:36:32] <arschmitz> and once a branch is merged i can just delete the folder
[07:36:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice ... noticing that you can also symlink the .git ...
[07:37:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, you don't have to pull the same thing five times.
[07:37:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i started this way because i could have different branches open at same time to compare stuff with out needing to keep checkingout
[07:38:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i pushed latest changesto flipswitch
[07:39:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, thanks!
[07:39:43] <arschmitz> ah actually hold on i didnt check to make sure before i pushed i didnt leave anything crazy going on 
[07:39:46] <frequent> _|Nix|_: cool. Thx for yesterdays fixes in table. I hope filter bears no shaking heads...
[07:39:47] <arschmitz> and i deffintly did lol
[07:44:22] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Do we really need the word "filter" on options "filterPlaceholder", "filterReveal", and "filterCallback"?
[07:44:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ^
[07:44:45] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I thought for backwards compat
[07:44:53] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Oh, we have them now?
[07:45:07] <arschmitz> if we have them now then yes 
[07:45:40] <frequent> yup
[07:45:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'm out of touch with this ... do we have an existing filter widget somewhere? I think the demos front page has one, but ... ummm ... how does that fit in here?
[07:45:54] <frequent> listview filter extension
[07:45:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its the extension to listview
[07:46:13] <frequent> which is replaced by the filter widget
[07:46:36] <frequent> so to keep old code working I just left the filter-prefix

[07:48:51] <_|Nix|_> frequent: OK. Understood. Then we must keep the option names as they are.
[07:49:25] <frequent> I guess. One thing I did not figure out is why I cannot make a widget named "filter"
[07:49:34] <frequent> that somehow conflicts with the filter method
[07:49:42] <frequent> $(".foo").filter...
[07:50:05] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Of course, because $( ".foo" ).filter() would then create a new filter widget.
[07:50:05] <frequent> so "filterbar", which I don't really like
[07:50:19] <frequent> (is thankful for the explanation)
[07:50:22] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... instead of reducing the set of matches returned by the selector.
[07:50:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: With the changes I just pushed, can we consider https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4698 closed? I wasn't sure whether I should close it from one of the commits or not.

[07:56:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[07:56:08] <arschmitz> i botched a commit on flip and it was way more trouble then it was worth to resolve the conflicts
[07:56:22] <arschmitz> im going to remove flip branch right now
[07:56:39] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I made one commit where I updated all the files in the demos
[07:56:51] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Oh, cool ...
[07:56:59] <frequent> so you'd just have to update that commit
[07:57:37] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Wait a sec ... I just pulled from your repo and I already have all the commits.
[07:57:37] <frequent> there is one example backbone+JQM which uses an old version of JQM. that is the only place where I left the old listview.filter extension, since the example has it's own JQM file
[07:57:47] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[07:58:17] <frequent> hm. let me see.
[07:58:45] <_|Nix|_> frequent: The last commit I have from you is c35285e797fc53366ec442b09daa98c44d302404
[07:59:17] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Also, you should consider writing your commit messages using the format "Parts affected: Changes made. Fixes #nnnn."
[07:59:32] <frequent> ok. will do.
[07:59:45] <frequent> the commit you mention adds the new demos page. 
[07:59:55] <frequent> the commit before https://github.com/frequent/jquery-mobile/commit/c337959ace7514bd286245c4b3459b7f01fc4172 updates the demos
[07:59:56] <b-ot> frequent: frequent (1d 17h ago): replaced all references to listview filter with filter widget
[08:00:09] <frequent> thx b-ot
[08:00:36] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Right. OK. I get it. I guess I'd have to replace the references again. Like, apply that commit again, but with a different name.
[08:00:59] <frequent> hm. still striving for my git-black-belt...
[08:02:39] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Well, I don't think I can do this with git. However, find -type f | grep -vE '\.git|node_modules' | while read; do  grep -nH filterbar "$REPLY"; done reveals 33 references to "filterbar", so I'll just replace those and rename all the files.
[08:03:36] <frequent> ah. black-belt you have...
[08:04:12] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Neah *blush* ... you should see the guys in #bash ...
[08:09:31] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... we have a widget named filtertext that reacts to data-filtertext ... *scratch head* ....
[08:15:25] <_|Nix|_> frequent: OK, running the tests on the renamed widget. Can you have a look at http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/demos to make sure the widget still works? I'll do the same, but you probably know better what to look for.

[08:17:10] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Oh ... CSS classes are probably messed up ...
[08:17:23] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#507 (master - 433d555 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build was fixed.
[08:17:23] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/2978275191f1...433d5552cd55
[08:17:23] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/9191682
[08:17:44] <frequent> _|Nix|_: let me look
[08:18:13] <_|Nix|_> frequent: The filter dropdown listview on the demos front page is visible.
[08:18:21] <frequent> _|Nix|_: yes.
[08:18:40] <frequent> because the CSS had li.ui-screen-hidden {display:none}
[08:18:56] <frequent> which I changed to .ui-screen-hidden {display: none}
[08:19:11] <frequent> which I think gets overwritten by the listview widget which comes after the filter widget
[08:19:29] <frequent> so the classes are assigned correctly, but .ui-screen-hidden is overruled
[08:19:39] <frequent> I was tending to !important
[08:20:15] <_|Nix|_> frequent: What about changing the inclusion order?
[08:20:28] <frequent> I prefer
[08:20:49] <frequent> then it should work as before (first listview widget, than listview.filter.extension)
[08:22:32] <frequent> _|Nix|_: other than that the filter demo page looks ok. Except, I don't know how to correctly include code snippets <pre><code>foo</code></pre>
[08:24:24] <_|Nix|_> frequent: <div data-demo-html="true|selector-for-HTML-demo-element" data-demo-js="true|selector-for-script-tag"></div>
[08:24:36] <_|Nix|_> frequent: data-demo-html="true" means the div itself contains the HTML.
[08:24:53] <_|Nix|_> frequent: data-demo-js="true" means take any non-src= <script> tags from the <head>.
[08:25:55] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Wait a sec ... demos/widgets/filter/ already has "View Source" buttons ...
[08:26:48] <_|Nix|_> frequent: You could just make demos with those custom callbacks and make a "View Source" button for each.
[08:26:53] <frequent> yes. It's only the... Filter Custom Callback
[08:27:08] <frequent> which looks broken.
[08:28:00] <_|Nix|_> frequent: <head>...<script id="#custom-callback-example-1">/*custom callback goes here*/</script>...</head><body>...<div data-demo-js="#custom-callback-example-1">...</div>
[08:28:06] <frequent> _|Nix|_: and where I only wanted to display the code
[08:28:16] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Then the code will show up in a "View Source" button's popup.
[08:28:16] <frequent> ok
[08:28:57] <_|Nix|_> So, I guess the only major stumbling block here is the fact that the main search list is visible ... that's just weird.
[08:31:01] <frequent> _|Nix|_: if you change order of the widgets being loaded (filter after listview) or set .ui-screen-hidden {display: none !important;} it will work.
[08:31:07] <_|Nix|_> I don't get how come listview.css comes after filtertext.css when filtertext.css is included after listview CSS ...
[08:31:58] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... wait a sec ... doesn't filter require listview for it to work properly?
[08:32:52] <frequent> mh. 
[08:33:09] <_|Nix|_> frequent: You should be executing .listview() on the list during _create()
[08:33:17] <frequent> you can call a filter on any element which has children, so it's not really depending on a widget being there
[08:33:56] <frequent> so <div data-filter="true"><p>a</p><p>b</p></div> would work
[08:34:07] <frequent> should work...
[08:34:29] <_|Nix|_> frequent: OK. I get it.
[08:35:20] <_|Nix|_> So, like, woah ... you can't hide list items by adding ui-screen-hidden?
[08:35:59] <frequent> because the listview widget is loaded after the filter widget. I guess
[08:43:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so .ui-listview > li { display: block; } (jquery.mobile.css:3525) takes precedence over .ui-screen-hidden { display:none; } (jquery.mobile.css:3525)?
[08:44:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry, the latter rule should be line 4627 - i.e., later on in the file.
[08:45:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: okay, I'll fix that on master
[08:45:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hold on ... it's about the filter widget.
[08:45:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So it's not on master.
[08:46:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: has that CSS been changed in the PR?
[08:46:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If I changed .ui-screen-hidden to .ui-filter + * > .ui-screen-hidden would that cause display: none; to have priority?
[08:46:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. Hold on. I'll push the branch.

[08:47:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we shouldn't use * selector if not really necessary and it has specificity 0 so I guess it won't fix it
[08:49:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I dunno much about these things, however, that's what describes the relationship of the items that should be hidden to the filter widget that adds the ui-screen-hidden class to them.
[08:50:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The children of the element following .ui-filter.
[08:50:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in what file is that ui-screen-hidden rule?
[08:51:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nvm
[08:51:33] <uGoMobi> found it
[08:52:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: change .ui-screen-hidden to .ui-filter .ui-screen-hidden and it should work
[08:52:25] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/filter-widget-review/css/structure/jquery.mobile.filtertext.css#L23
[08:52:38] <_|Nix|_> Nono, because .ui-screen-hidden is contained in the element following .ui-filter.
[08:52:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, the selector I mentioned works!
[08:52:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: .ui-filter + * > .ui-screen-hidden
[08:53:06] <_|Nix|_> Things are now hidden: http://localhost/nix/jqm/demos/
[08:53:22] <uGoMobi> ah, ui-filter is not the parent
[08:53:24] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[08:54:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: * is a slow selector
[08:54:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I dunno how else to say whatever element follows .ui-filter
[08:54:57] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 06filter-widget-review: 02http://git.io/k0fgrQ
[08:54:58] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06filter-widget-review 1461aceca 15Gabriel Schulhof: Filtertext: CSS: Make sure items controlled by the filter that are supposed to be hidden are hidden.
[08:55:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can change it to "html body .ui-screen-hidden"
[08:55:23] <uGoMobi> that will override .ui-listview > li
[08:55:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but that has wider meaning than just the filter widget.
[08:56:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, ui-screen-hidden also appears in (custom?) select.
[08:56:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true, but that's the case already because now it's just ui-screen-hidden
[08:56:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So this may be a common solution for all.
[08:56:43] <uGoMobi> it should always hide the element
[08:56:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but then it should go into core, right?
[08:57:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was just thinking about that
[08:57:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we only use it for listviews though... in the select it's also a listview
[08:58:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But with filter it could be a controlgoup, or a collapsibleSet, or whatever.
[08:58:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[08:58:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but then it's ok to have it in the filtertext CSS
[08:59:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we also set in select CSS
[08:59:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, for now I pushed the (inefficient) change, and we can always improve it later. For now, I'll take some time off. I'll be back in a few hours.
[08:59:25] <uGoMobi> and it's always display none
[09:00:01] <uGoMobi> so it won't do any harm if the rule from filtertext CSS is applied to select list item with same class
[09:00:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. So, conclusion: html body .ui-screen-hidden ?
[09:00:41] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Have a look at http://view.jquerymobile.com/filter-widget-review/demos/ 
[09:00:49] <frequent> ok
[09:00:51] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Please let me know if you find anything else.
[09:01:01] <frequent> will do
[09:01:06] <frequent> thx so far
[09:01:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: leave the inefficient change
[09:01:11] <_|Nix|_> frequent: NP.
[09:01:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Will do.
[09:01:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I'll review selectors later

[10:03:43] <jlembeck> scott_gonzalez: I didn't quite understand the question. hasFeature returns true in all new browsers for that test; however, in earlier Firefox, when there is support for svg but not svg in an img src, it returns false for that test
[10:04:05] <jlembeck> it's the only way to test for both to make sure the correct fallback is called
[10:04:17] <scott_gonzalez> jlembeck: Why do you care about Firefox 3.6 though?
[10:04:56] <jlembeck> (and before), we care because that is a version of firefox that exists before auto-updating, which means that it still has a user base (mostly corporate)
[10:05:21] <jlembeck> and that amount of JS to insure that the correct fallback is called in any browser we test in is important
[10:07:43] <scott_gonzalez> Did you get an actual bug report for this?
[10:09:00] <scott_gonzalez> Ultimately it doesn't matter, since it's not a jQuery project.
[10:09:13] <scott_gonzalez> It only came up because the support test was copied into jQuery Mobile.
[10:10:05] <jlembeck> It's tough to claim that you support all browsers with your tool when you don't support one that you test with
[10:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, Firefox 3.6 did get auto-update last year.
[10:10:21] <jlembeck> it's also a problem in 3.5, iirc

[13:31:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[13:31:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! I can't reproduce that issue frequent found.
[13:32:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wait - I think I just did :)
[13:32:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I haven't tried yet
[13:32:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wait - I haven't reproduced it.
[13:33:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If the list of filterable items in the widget list is longer than the page then you get two scrollbars ...
[13:34:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think the page has a scrollbar and the document has a scrollbar.
[13:34:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is that in our demos?
[13:34:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if so I blame the panel wrapper
[13:34:36] <uGoMobi> (which we try to kill)
[13:34:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's in our demo. The front page.
[13:34:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I know the issue
[13:35:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am pretty sure it will be gone if we no longer wrap page contents
[13:35:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Either way, I don't see what frequent has been seeing.
[13:36:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok let's ask frequent tomorrow
[13:36:17] <uGoMobi> maybe on a specific browser
[13:36:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, it sounds like a logic error though, meaning it should show up on any browser - but I guess not *shrug*

[14:01:02] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06filter-widget-review 149cc1516 15Gabriel Schulhof: Demos: Enhance front page widget list and global search list via autoinit instead of explicit calls to .filtertext()....
[14:01:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I found the problem. I removed explicit calls to .filtertext(). I mean, now that the widget is a proper widget, we have autoinit for it, so we should use that instead of explicit calls to .filtertext().
[14:02:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: BTW, I'm still a bit uncomfortable with the name "filtertext". I'm not sure what else we could call it thought.
[14:02:27] <_|Nix|_> s/t\.$/./
[14:02:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great that you found the problem!
[14:02:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree about the name
[14:03:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why isn't it just .filter() ?
[14:03:09] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... I dunno ... "textfilter"? "filterwidget"?
[14:03:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: $( "a" ).filter( ".my-links" ).addClass( "blag" );
[14:03:43] <uGoMobi> ah right
[14:03:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: $.fn.filter() is taken, and I don't think DaveMethvin will let go of that one ;)
[14:03:57] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:04:15] <uGoMobi> we are pirates... we just take it ;)
[14:04:21] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:04:33] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... "search"?
[14:04:56] <_|Nix|_> "textsearch">
[14:04:57] <_|Nix|_> ?
[14:05:09] <_|Nix|_> ... as opposed to image search, sound search, etc.
[14:05:25] <uGoMobi> hmm
[14:05:29] <_|Nix|_> "keywordseach"?
[14:05:48] <_|Nix|_> I can do another vsed pass ...
[14:06:00] <_|Nix|_> ... just need a name to replace it with ...
[14:07:01] <_|Nix|_> I'm totally out of ideas ...
[14:07:42] <_|Nix|_> "itemfilter"?
[14:07:45] <uGoMobi> filterable?
[14:08:19] <uGoMobi> sounds bit weird maybe
[14:08:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ummm ... nonono ... "-able" is usually an interface ... well, maybe not. It suggests that this widget renders whatever it is applied to "filterable".
[14:08:30] <uGoMobi> was inspired by the UI widget names
[14:08:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. Not bad, actually.
[14:10:03] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ^ What do you think about "filterable" for a widget that hides an element's children if they match the search text?
[14:10:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm good with filterable so far, and I can always change it again later.
[14:11:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, but good to ask UI guys what they think
[14:11:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, they have plenty of experience with .*ables :)
[14:12:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: otherwise we go for .usethiswidgetifyouwanttofiltersomething()
[14:12:12] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> Filterable sounds fine.
[14:12:34] <_|Nix|_> .willletyouhidethingsiftheymatchsometext()
[14:12:39] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Cool! Sold!
[14:12:45] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> "-able" doesn't imply an interface. It implies a behavior applied to an element.
[14:13:27] <scott_gonzalez> Like draggable, resizable, sortable, selectable, etc.
[14:13:56] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, I'm beginning to see it that way. My only concern was that we're adding a significant bit of UI by slapping a whole input on top.
[14:14:02] <uGoMobi> ok, then it's the right name for this
[14:14:16] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So it feels more like a widget, but I guess it's not exactly standalone, because it needs something /to/ filter.
[14:14:26] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, yeah ... behaviour.
[14:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> Is this a generic filtering widget? Or is it designed for specific markup/use with other widgets?
[14:15:17] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: It's fairly generic. It'll slap ui-screen-hidden on the children of this.element after calling a callback to decide whether it should do so.
[14:15:37] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and it'll place the input right before this.element.
[14:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, filterable sounds like a fine name.
[14:16:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Awesome!
[14:36:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: should we rename class ui-filter to ui-filterable?
[14:54:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I'll do it.
[14:54:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and move the integration tests, etc.
[14:54:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool, thanks
[15:08:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Any change you could merge https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1024? It'd be nice if we could pull a version of the factory that contains that change before we hit 1.4.0. Otherwise, I'll implement a workaround in our base class.
