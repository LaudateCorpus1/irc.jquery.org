[07:41:13] <toddparker> paging dr. Krinkle
[07:41:45] <toddparker> jzaefferer: I have a designer working on your new Qunit logo
[07:42:09] <toddparker> his name is zach
[07:42:14] <toddparker> 2 questions on that ticket
[07:42:40] <toddparker> is it QUnit or Qunit
[07:42:54] <toddparker> Qunit looks better in logo form anyway
[07:43:01] <toddparker> #2
[07:43:12] <toddparker> tagline: what 2-3 word tagline should we use?
[07:45:09] <toddparker> for this issue: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/222
[07:45:10] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #222 on qunit (Krinkle; 3m, 3w ago): Fix logo for QUnit (font inconsistency)
[07:56:03] <Krinkle> QUnit
[07:56:10] <Krinkle> toddparker:
[07:56:32] <Krinkle> #2: tag line, don't know
[07:57:08] <Krinkle> toddparker: Either QUnit or qUnit. Never Qunit. Note, we never used qUnit officially, but might be worth a consideration.
[07:57:42] <Krinkle> I like the big Q, as it machos the jQuery logo
[07:59:02] <jzaefferer> toddparker: its QUnit. May not look great in logo form, but its kind of too late for that :-)
[07:59:20] <jzaefferer> does "JavaScript unit testing" fit?
[07:59:45] <Krinkle> perhaps just "unit testing" ?
[07:59:50] <jzaefferer> or that
[08:00:02] <Krinkle> (we don't label js in the other tag lines)
[08:00:13] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: checking out the IE failure now you e-mailed me about
[08:00:49] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I like the new QUnit checkboxes, nice work.
[08:01:34] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: from the "why didn't we do that earlier" deparment :-)
[08:06:36] <Krinkle> defintly
[08:06:40] <Krinkle> Oh and a release
[08:06:44] * Krinkle updates wikimedia
[08:07:20] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Hm.. whats with the "unknown" merges in Qunit ?

[08:07:51] <Krinkle> odd
[08:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> I know who that is!
[08:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> And shame on you, jzaefferer!
[09:18:37] <toddparker> QUnit it is
[09:18:58] <toddparker> it's odd because the Qu mark and QUinit are right next to each other in the logo
[09:19:06] <toddparker> but that's a bigger can of worms
[09:22:11] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Menu styling is wonky in IE8. We'll need to figure that out.
[09:22:19] * kborchers hides
[09:23:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez i'll take a look tonight or this weekend
[09:24:37] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to join #accessibility on irc.mozilla.org, I'm about to explain the issue to them and see if they have any input.
[09:24:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez sure, be there in a sec
[09:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> Hans said he should be available in about half an hour to an hour to talk as well.
[09:25:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez may be in a meeting but ping me and i'll join if available
[09:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:52:54] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: As I'm typing this out for free-aria, I know exactly what's happening.
[09:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> It actually makes sense. I think we should kill the long delay and drop to 1ms.
[09:53:17] <kborchers> :)
[09:53:21] <kborchers> yeah?
[09:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> The "menu expanded" announcement is useful when a menu expands but focus has not moved.
[09:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> If the focus moves, then you get the announcement of the newly focused item, and so there's no need to announce that the menu is expanded.
[09:54:33] <kborchers> right … i was trying to explain that last night but couldn't word it correctly. i was just saying that things were happening too fast so NVDA skipped it because it wasn't useful anymore
[09:54:36] <scott_gonzalez> You know the context because you moved the focus.
[09:54:56] <scott_gonzalez> Right, you did say that :-)
[09:55:28] <scott_gonzalez> We'll wait for Hans, but my vote would be to drop the delay to 1.
[09:55:35] <kborchers> ok, sounds good
[11:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Hans agrees we can drop the delay.
[11:25:42] <kborchers> ok cool. i'll push that change in a few. thanks
[11:25:54] <scott_gonzalez> So you can just remove the value completely, since _delay() has a default value.
[11:26:10] <kborchers> oh, right. ok
[11:29:48] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez did you happen to get to play with the click delay that i removed completely. seemed ok when i tested but wanted another set of eyes before i ripped it out.
[11:30:14] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't. I'll do that as soon as this call is over.
[11:30:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez ok thanks
[11:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> Ada on the main level one of three.
[11:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: looks good
[11:43:09] <kborchers> lol
[11:43:12] <kborchers> and thanks
[11:44:00] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] kborchers pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/wT-QxA
[11:44:00] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu: Remove unnecessary click delay and change focus delay for AT to the default delay - kborchers
[11:44:20] <kborchers> wow, that's a lot of "delay"
[11:44:24] <kborchers> :)
[11:44:33] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:48:53] <scott_gonzalez> Now I need to figure out why jquery-git breaks dialog.
[11:49:23] <scott_gonzalez> The tests don't run to completion with git :-/
[11:51:27] <gnarf> thats no good
[11:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> Bah, it's a bad test.
[11:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's what happens when the community writes tests :-P
[11:55:58] <scott_gonzalez> $.contains( jQuery, element )
[11:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> That apparently worked in 1.7.2
[12:02:17] <gnarf> for like main document contains element?
[12:52:43] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/NK2Maw
