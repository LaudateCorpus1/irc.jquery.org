[06:12:51] <ruprict> So (hoping this isn't a really bad question) is the best way to get/stay involved to troll the bugs.jqueryui.com?
[06:51:28] <scott_gonzalez> you can subscribe to the timeline: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/timeline
[06:51:38] <scott_gonzalez> there's a link to an RSS feed at the bottom
[08:59:26] <ajpiano> ruprict: you can also get e-mail notifications
[09:01:21] <ruprict> ajpiano: Fair enough, but a new contributor may have trouble filtering stuff, picking the right bugs to look at, etc.  Sounds a bit whiny, I guess.  I wonder if, as a part of triage, marking bugs as easy, medium, difficult (presuming you don't already)
[09:01:44] <ruprict> Leave the low hanging fruit for noobs….make sense? Or am I a nutjob?
[09:02:02] <ajpiano> well, i won't say you're a nutjob :p
[09:02:16] <jzaefferer> ruprict, how to tell what the low hanging fruit is? if its obvious, we'll just fix it right away anyway...
[09:02:21] <ajpiano> but yeah, we have to fix the bugs we get - we're not gonna leave the simplest bugs that can be solved un fixed
[09:02:33] <ajpiano> just in the hopes that someone will come along and solve it
[09:02:38] <jzaefferer> that makes it kinda hard to get started in any case
[09:02:47] <ajpiano> ruprict: the best thing is probably to make your own assessment of the ticket
[09:02:52] <ruprict> So, other suggestions?  Or is the process not broke?
[09:02:52] <ajpiano> and if you have questions, just to ask folks in here
[09:02:58] <ruprict> K
[09:03:16] <ajpiano> also you should probably know that most hairy tickets on the interactions aren't worth your pursuit :)
[09:03:27] <ajpiano> so draggable sortable droppable resizable
[09:03:48] <ruprict> My instincts have service me well on those, then :)
[09:03:57] <ruprict> served
[09:03:59] <ajpiano> heh
[09:04:07] <ajpiano> ruprict, we have a weekly public dev meeting as well
[09:04:14] <jzaefferer> meeting now starting in #jquery-meeting
[09:04:18] <ruprict> I lurked the one last week...
[09:04:19] <ajpiano> ^^
[09:04:19] <ajpiano> :p
[09:38:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you had some random discussion you wanted to have yesterday, want to try that now before i need to run?
[09:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> won't have time between the UI meeting and the grid meeting, will you be around later or tomorrow?
[09:40:00] <gnarf> yes, and yes
[09:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let me know when you're around (after the meetings)
[10:51:20] <rworth> danheberden: I'm not sure I understood your point about themeswitcher and hotlinking today, ex. http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7457
[10:57:20] <danheberden> my point about it was separate - though it looks like i need to do some more tweaks for the allowed images
[10:57:31] <danheberden> nice to have a ticket for it now :)
[10:57:34] <rworth> ok, thanks
[11:32:48] <scott_gonzalez> hhillen: you around?
[13:15:14] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: widget-delegation Jörn Zaefferer * 2d1b9b3 (1 files in 1 dirs): Widget delegation: First draft - http://bit.ly/kNUNyG
[14:03:15] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: core-1.6.1 Scott González * da84672 (21 files in 9 dirs): .attr() -> .prop() - http://bit.ly/lhDFZF
[14:22:41] <kborchers> am i just thinking about them backwards or are ui-icon-radio-on and ui-icon-radio-off reversed?
[14:23:07] <kborchers> seems like on should be "checked" and off shouldn't but they are the other way around
[14:43:46] <rworth> kborchers: they are indeed reversed
[14:44:38] <rworth> I noticed it some time back. We haven't fixed it yet in case it breaks something. Plan on fixing it with hopefully new set of icons coming with next version of ThemeRoller
[14:45:08] <rworth> maybe they'll even be scalable. http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/26308090/ThemeRoller-icon-set
[14:45:44] <rworth> even without that, we should probably fix in 1.9 and just clearly document it in the changelog and the upgrade guide
[14:46:12] <rworth> I think it's the risk-benifit is too great to fix in 1.8
