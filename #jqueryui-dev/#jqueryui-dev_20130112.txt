[09:21:51] <mikesherov> Mik-_-: this is the wrong channel for that. This is for the development of jQuery UI itself. You want #jquery
[09:21:58] <Mik-_-> ok thx

[15:02:39] <tj_vantoll> Not sure if anyone is around, but I'm trying to get up a local version of api.jqueryui.com and when I run npm install I get:
[15:02:39] <tj_vantoll> npm ERR! error installing js-yaml@1.0.2
[15:02:39] <tj_vantoll> npm ERR! error installing grunt-jquery-content@0.8.1

[15:02:41] <tj_vantoll> Any ideas?
[15:12:06] <ajpiano> uhoh
[15:12:14] <ajpiano> tj_vantoll: have you built the sites locally before?
[15:12:20] <ajpiano> tj_vantoll: what version of node
[15:12:33] <tj_vantoll> I have not built them before.
[15:13:18] <tj_vantoll> Huh, looks like I'm on node 0.6.12
[15:13:20] <ajpiano> ah
[15:13:23] <ajpiano> yeah
[15:13:25] <ajpiano> upgrade node
[15:15:31] <tj_vantoll> Alright thanks.
