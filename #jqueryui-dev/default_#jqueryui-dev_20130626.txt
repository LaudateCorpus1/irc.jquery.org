[06:35:52] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: do you need more input or testing on the DB/grunt refactor?
[06:36:13] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I think we are good right
[06:37:31] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, shall we land that?
[06:46:42] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I don't recall if there was an official announcement that 0.5 would have breaking changes, but if you do send a PR, you'll want to include versions for all grunt plugins as well.
[06:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> Might want to just ask in #polymer about it first.
[06:47:04] <scott_gonzalez> Just be like "Guys, do you know how crazy you are?!?"
[06:58:17] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: in portland you had mentioned wanting mobile to join the ui meeting today to talk widgets do you still want to do that?
[06:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: yup
[06:59:18] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: sounds good just wanted to make sure
[07:01:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok â€¦ i may rephrase but :)

[12:25:41] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what does "Mobile Widgets" refer to on the agenda? 
[12:26:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: also, I have this list of mobile widgets, with some notes on portability to UI: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/5b16b9aa19726f351d90
[12:29:31] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: anything on this list that isn't done yet? https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/6b7e3a7e27a17a594bfd
[12:30:35] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: have you looked at the datepicker "builder methods" yet?
[12:32:05] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i wish i could comment line by line on your widget notes :)
[12:33:18] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: Yeah, I've started on it a little. Haven't made it far yet though. Most of my time has went to triage with Scott gone last week.
[12:33:48] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, all the landings have been landed :/
[12:34:03] <rxaviers> is this one good to land too? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/951/ (remaining one) 
[12:34:45] <gseguin> johnbender: ping
[12:35:02] <rxaviers> About your first two bullets (the manifest thing), I'd like to discuss a reconsideration with you.
[12:35:10] <rxaviers> with you and scott
[12:35:31] <gseguin> arschmitz: how much do you know about the new navigation code?
[12:35:48] <arschmitz> gseguin: im fairly familier with it
[12:35:49] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I think its good. If you someone else to test it, you'd have to make that clear.
[12:36:10] <rxaviers> I dont unless you think it's necessary
[12:36:14] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: okay. Well, he's back :-)
[12:36:30] <jzaefferer> we'll have to do proper testing when doing the 1.11.0 release anyone.
[12:36:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: whats up?
[12:37:00] <gseguin> arschmitz: oh I guess my question is about that 1.3.1 codebase
[12:37:06] <gseguin> let me pull a pointer to the line
[12:37:07] <rxaviers> yeap, for me it seems good to go. Will land that then
[12:37:37] <arschmitz> gseguin: navigation has not really changed from 1.3.1 just moved a few things around and added content widget
[12:37:43] <arschmitz> which is not yet in master
[12:37:57] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: Yep. I should have time this weekend to make some progress.
[12:39:00] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay, good. We can discuss the rest as needed
[12:39:10] <rxaviers> ok
[12:39:46] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'm confused, I can't find the code I have in github
[12:39:51] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'll get back to you
[12:40:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: no problem ill be here all day :)

[12:43:20] <uGoMobi> hey
[12:43:25] <gseguin> is there a reason we don't send state to the beforenavigate event handlers ?
[12:43:26] <uGoMobi> gseguin: how's your leg?

[12:43:35] <gseguin> uGoMobi: better
[12:43:40] <gseguin> still a bit sore
[12:43:41] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok good
[12:43:45] <uGoMobi> hmm
[12:43:47] <gseguin> but much better
[12:45:07] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you expect to be fit again before the team activity on next conf? ;)
[12:45:10] <arschmitz> gseguin: not that i think of
[12:45:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: i think its just how johnbender wrote it 
[12:46:45] <arschmitz> gseguin: i cant see any reason why it would be bad to pass it
[12:48:57] <arschmitz> gseguin: as far as i know the only reason for before navigate is to be able to allow you to preventDefault
[12:49:11] <gseguin> uGoMobi: 1 month to 100% recovery the doc said
[12:49:45] <gseguin> arschmitz: exactly and that's why passing the state might be a good idea
[12:49:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah i agree
[12:50:00] <gseguin> so the listeners can prevent default conditionally
[12:50:04] <arschmitz> and i cant see what harm could be done
[12:50:08] <arschmitz> by passing it
[12:50:22] <gseguin> *paging dr johnbender*
[12:51:07] <gseguin> alright I'll do a local patch and validate that it does what I want and will patch jqm after that
[12:51:11] <gseguin> thanks arschmitz
[12:51:20] <arschmitz> gseguin: no problem
[12:57:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: shall we copy jzaefferer his mobile notes md in a Google doc so we can commend on each line?
[12:57:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was thinking that exactly actually
[12:57:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great minds... ;)
[12:58:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i jzaefferer also asked if we could do something similar with ui widgets
[12:58:44] <arschmitz> but i wanted to wait until you were back thought we could work on it together
[12:58:57] <uGoMobi> good idea, we can do that in same doc
[13:00:12] <jzaefferer> Sure, go ahead
[13:00:30] <jzaefferer> I grant you a royality free license to my notes ;)
[13:00:56] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: thank you so much ;)
[13:01:38] <johnbender> gseguin: you're going to jinx it
[13:02:21] <gseguin> johnbender: :)
[13:02:28] <johnbender> gseguin: just read back
[13:02:49] <johnbender> gseguin: there shouldn't be
[13:02:54] <gseguin> johnbender: and so?
[13:03:12] <johnbender> gseguin: as long as it comes after the hashchange and popstate bindings
[13:03:16] <gseguin> ok I'll add state as a data attrib in the event
[13:03:17] <johnbender> then the state will be valuable given the method
[13:03:35] <johnbender> gseguin: what's the use case?
[13:03:50] <johnbender> we don't document the beforenavigate event so it's probably safe
[13:03:55] <johnbender> just curious
[13:04:00] <johnbender> (it's for internal use)
[13:04:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you around meeting time!
[13:04:29] <gseguin> I want to popup a confirm box when navigating to a set of pages
[13:04:55] <gseguin> so I stop navigation, look at the url asked
[13:05:22] <gseguin> and resume navigation depending on the user's choice in the confirm popup
[13:05:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ still on vacation I think
[13:05:36] <gseguin> johnbender: does that make sense?
[13:05:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah but he said he would be around for this meeting
[13:06:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, that would be great
[13:06:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: link to Google doc should be in your mail
[13:06:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i got it thank you
[13:06:49] <arschmitz> you and your dutch google docs lol
[13:06:58] <toddmparker> is the meeting now? if so, sorry, i can hop on
[13:07:10] <snowyrooftops> #jquerymobile
[13:07:29] <snowyrooftops> Hi!
[13:08:09] <snowyrooftops> I've tried pretty much everything I could find online to get file uploads working (data-ajax=false and disabling ajax for forms) but my jquery mobile page still refuses to upload the file
[13:08:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: will see if I can change my pref to english somewhere
[13:08:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes, 1.4 alpha in week of July 15
[13:09:07] <gseguin> snowyrooftops: this is the developper channel
[13:09:22] <gseguin> snowyrooftops: for support please use the forums or the #jquery channel
[13:09:37] <snowyrooftops> gseguin: Ah, sorry
[13:09:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: maybe you can tweet it from @jquerymobile account
[13:09:50] <gseguin> snowyrooftops: no worries
[13:15:13] <johnbender> gseguin: yep that makes sense to me
[13:15:39] <johnbender> gseguin: at some point I was hoping to unify both the hashchange popstate bindings in the navigator object using beforenavigate
[13:15:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its fine its not a big deal just makes spell check go crazy!
[13:15:52] <johnbender> gseguin: but your binding would happen after that one in theory
[13:15:58] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[13:16:09] <johnbender> gseguin: well, assuming it comes after the setup method of the navigate event
[13:16:12] <johnbender> gseguin: so beware
[13:16:30] <johnbender> gseguin: I think _|Nix|_ set it up so that binding to beforenavigate also sets up navigate
[13:16:46] <johnbender> gseguin: so you just have to make sure that the frameworks binding happens first
[13:16:49] <johnbender> then you should be fine
[13:17:00] <johnbender> otherwise the state won't be populated from history properly
[13:18:10] <gseguin> cool, thanks johnbender
[13:19:49] <johnbender> gseguin: arschmitz: yah what's the plan for the meeting?
[13:20:06] <arschmitz> johnbender: meeting is going on right now
[13:20:07] <gseguin> is meeting on Wed now?
[13:20:22] <arschmitz> we are having first combined ui mobile meeting
[13:20:28] <gseguin> oh got it we aligned with UI
[13:21:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: not for every time 
[13:21:20] <arschmitz> gseguin: probably like once a month i think is the current plan last i heard
[13:21:30] <gseguin> arschmitz: k
[10:10:36] <kborchers> arschmitz: i only op when i need ot :)
[10:10:40] <kborchers> to*
[10:11:02] <arschmitz> kborchers: so much for mobile lol 
[10:11:02] <arschmitz> almost got to that :)
[10:11:13] <kborchers> yeah that sucks
[10:11:17] <arschmitz> oh thats right your on the board now so op away
[10:14:17] <didiergm> hi is there a good tutorial/ doc on how to create a new widget for JQM ?
[10:14:52] <arschmitz> didiergm: i can give you a link to the document of best practices we use internally
[10:16:10] <arschmitz> didiergm: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit
[10:19:34] <didiergm> arschmitz thanks a lot
[12:18:30] <toddmparker> eesh, got yanked onto a call back there. uGoMobi - saw you pull din the new icons, where did you land on how to embed?
[12:18:47] <toddmparker> i can loop scott j. in if you want to explore alternates to the js embed
[12:19:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: heh, was about to write you an email about icons
[12:19:34] <toddmparker> read your mind
[12:20:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: was curious about what you tweeted about font icons too... you think that would be something for JQM or better to use SVG / Grunticon?
[12:21:37] <toddmparker> well, font icons are a problem because they fail on opera mini, WP7.-7.8, older stuff too
[12:22:19] <uGoMobi> right, but I thought you said something about a fallback?
[12:22:50] <uGoMobi> or no solution found for that yet?
[12:23:05] <toddmparker> not really. i looked into it, but no
[12:23:13] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:23:30] <toddmparker> the feature test has a lot of false positives so you need to UA some browsers out
[12:23:38] <uGoMobi> hmm :(
[12:23:40] <toddmparker> then you need to build a fallback
[12:23:45] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[12:24:01] <uGoMobi> let's go for Grunticon! :)
[12:24:06] <toddmparker> we could give it a go, but it's not there
[12:24:40] <toddmparker> grunt icon definitely works everywhere and has the same usability as an icon font - just add a class and done
[12:25:13] <uGoMobi> I have been thinking about how to implement Grunticon... performance vs. avoid too much fuzz
[12:25:17] <toddmparker> we just need to figure out how we want to load in the right stylesheet
[12:25:27] <toddmparker> yeah, agreed there
[12:25:27] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:25:36] <toddmparker> i think we may need to lean more towards ease of use 
[12:25:50] <toddmparker> which may mean not having the loader in the page 
[12:26:22] <uGoMobi> maybe we should make it possible to exclude loader in the download builder
[12:26:30] <toddmparker> yeah
[12:26:32] <uGoMobi> so you can put the script in the head
[12:26:39] <toddmparker> good point
[12:26:57] <toddmparker> so it could be packed up as part of your custom mobil build or left out
[12:27:00] <toddmparker> like that
[12:27:26] <uGoMobi> yes, that sounds good
[12:27:37] <uGoMobi> then we have to deal with the 3 CSS versions
[12:27:41] <toddmparker> do you have this wired in anywhere?
[12:28:01] <toddmparker> well, the js can take care of those, right?
[12:28:02] <uGoMobi> we can do that in the grunticon branch
[12:28:07] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[12:29:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes the JS takes care of it but was thinking about when people use custom theme etc
[12:29:30] <toddmparker> ah, i see
[12:30:17] <uGoMobi> what you already asked.... should it be in the theme CSS or 3rd part, icon CSS
[12:31:31] <uGoMobi> and keep it easy to use your own icons
[12:31:57] <uGoMobi> maybe we should just start implement this in that branch
[12:32:14] <uGoMobi> and then look at it from different use case angles
[12:32:52] <uGoMobi> I merged master into grunticon branch after next was merged into master
[12:34:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I can start working on this tomorrow, would be great if Scott and Andrew are around so I can ask them for help when needed
[12:54:59] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: sure, i'll make sure they are around
[12:55:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: great, thanks!

[12:57:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ZNC went down so you didn't miss much
[12:57:12] <arschmitz> or znc died rather
[12:57:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you still on vacation?
[12:58:22] <agcolom> Hi! meeting??? was that something I was supposed to attend? (are we still having our mobile meetings on thursday or is that moved now with ui?)
[12:58:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: there was a UI/mobile meeting
[12:58:57] <uGoMobi> but there were IRC problems
[12:58:58] <agcolom> oh sorry, I didn't know :(
[12:59:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... just checking in.
[12:59:29] <uGoMobi> didn't you guys get my email?
[12:59:39] <agcolom> I didn't...
[12:59:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, we still have our meetings on Thu
[13:00:28] <agcolom> oh, ok... I am confused...
[13:00:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if you are not busy id love to have you take a quick peak at my rewirte of textinput
[13:00:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool ...
[13:01:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I'll send a new email
[13:01:16] <agcolom> so we still have our thursday meetings... and you just had a one off with ui and mobile?
[13:01:23] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, thanks :-)
[13:01:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[13:01:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/commit/995337ef84199352311930701dd69ba06099b2ee
[13:01:50] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, that's fine then :-)
[13:02:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we need to revisit auto shrink for textareas i think 
[13:02:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: Jonathan was working on that
[13:03:07] <uGoMobi> I posted that solution in a comment on the ticket
[13:03:21] <arschmitz> i tried what i believe was the last solution we setteled on but it does not work sadly
[13:03:32] <uGoMobi> why not?
[13:03:45] <arschmitz> hold on ill find it
[13:04:32] <uGoMobi> ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2719
[13:05:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah heres the one i think we decided on http://jsbin.com/ulexaz/24/edit
[13:05:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: id is an option? (https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/commit/995337ef84199352311930701dd69ba06099b2ee#L3R20)
[13:06:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: remember thats for wrapper
[13:06:21] <arschmitz> to set id on wrapper
[13:06:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[13:10:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why do you need to store cornerclass in a variable? You should be able to use toggleClass if the class is known.
[13:11:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i thought i removed those
[13:11:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/commit/995337ef84199352311930701dd69ba06099b2ee#L3R124
[13:11:27] <arschmitz> ill fix that its the same with mini
[13:11:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[13:12:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/commit/995337ef84199352311930701dd69ba06099b2ee#L3R135 That should be .prop( "disabled", !!o.disabled )
[13:12:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... otherwise we mess with form reset.
[13:13:45] <arschmitz> yup
[13:13:55] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#417 (master - 46eefb8 : Alexander Schmitz): The build passed.
[13:13:55] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/e34f138c285e...46eefb87056d
[13:13:55] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/8478233
[13:14:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Otherwise, looking cool ...
[13:15:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what do you think about separating autogrow and clearbutton?
[13:18:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[13:18:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome 
[13:18:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If they don't want it they shouldn't be getting it.
[13:19:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ended up more a rewrite of whole widget then a review but i like the result
[13:19:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Have you checked how it performs wrt. old textinput in terms of enhancement, and maybe reaction time upon needing to grow?
[13:20:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nothing has changed with the function it works the same way
[13:20:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You should be able to place an enhanced textinput onto an otherwise plainjs page without too much hassle.
[13:20:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh you mean with the enhanced option for performance?
[13:21:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What I mean is this: How long does it take to enhance an input with the code in master vs. the re-written code?
[13:21:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Same question for search input and multiline autogrow input.
[13:21:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok yeah ill check it but there should not really be any difference 
[13:22:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: really need to find something better for this https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/commit/995337ef84199352311930701dd69ba06099b2ee#L3R90
[13:22:37] <arschmitz> makes textinput depend on support
[13:22:53] <arschmitz> which seems really senseless
[13:23:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, iOS 5 will be next on the chopping block ...
[13:23:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... could wait until then ...
[13:24:38] <arschmitz> yeah but still there has to be a better way this is a totally pointless dependency its a whole big file for one test on one os 
[13:24:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure ... 
[13:25:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... makes textinput really heavy.
[13:25:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: BTW: Does UI have a textinput? Is that yet another widget we need to reconcile?
[13:25:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not to mention its the only reason we even need the touchOverflow test
[13:25:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no they want to look at using ours
[13:25:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[13:26:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats part of why im going to have scott_gonzalez look this over
[13:26:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[13:26:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i had a thought though
[13:27:07] <arschmitz> that needs to be discussed in general for shared widgets
[13:27:30] <arschmitz> right now its easy for us to pull a ui widget we just extend with mobile base widget
[13:27:42] <arschmitz> its not really possible to go the other way]
[13:28:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... yeah, cuz we have that autoenhance thing ...
[13:28:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because they wont want the mobile base stuff or the autoinit
[13:28:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thinking anything shared should be written as a ui widget
[13:28:37] <arschmitz> then extended for mobile
[13:28:42] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[13:29:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the .mobile vs .ui namespace will require some though too
[13:31:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: UI is more pure-widget-oriented, whereas we're more about integration with plainjs. So, I think we should transfer our widgety code the enhancement part) to UI, and put the autoenhance/read-in-data-attributes portions in only as part of mobile. It will be interesting to see how we can interject an extension using AMD.
[13:31:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: anyway thats all stuff for a larger discussion which was going to be today but was not
[13:31:56] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[13:32:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats basicly exactly what i was saying :)
[13:32:27] <arschmitz> so glad we are on same page lol
[13:32:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... that's my correct-me-if-I'm-wrong approach at work :)
[13:32:33] <arschmitz> oh yeah :)
[13:32:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: might sound crazy but i wonder if we should switch to using the ui namespace or like .ui.mobile lol
[13:33:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, extensions and AMD aren't a great fit.
[13:33:47] <scott_gonzalez> The best option is probably to use the paths setting for r.js.
[13:34:02] <scott_gonzalez> So let's say you have widget.js widget-e1.js and widget-e2.js
[13:34:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and then call the dependency by the same name.
[13:34:17] <scott_gonzalez> You'd probably want to create a new file like widget-full.js which requires those three
[13:34:36] <scott_gonzalez> And use the paths config so that widget points to widget-full
[13:34:49] <scott_gonzalez> So you'd probably also need to use paths to change widget to something like widget-core
[13:35:01] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Another approach would be to use the concept of "provides".
[13:35:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and I think requirejs has that concept.
[13:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I haven't heard of that.
[13:35:53] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Like, both $.Widget and $.mobile.widget "provides" something like baseclass, or whatever you want to call it.
[13:36:48] <asheppard> _|Nix|_ are you referring to named defines?
[13:37:36] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: Well, I'm lead to believe that it's not a good idea to have those, and it would be misleading to use the same name on two different base classes.
[13:38:13] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: I don't remember if paths can be made to point to file names as well ... 
[13:39:32] <asheppard> thinking paths would work
[13:39:45] <asheppard> is it only the base class that would need to be swapped out?
[13:40:01] <asheppard> $.Widget becomes $.mobile.widget
[13:40:54] <asheppard> or is it more complex
[13:40:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's not exactly a swap, because $.mobile.widget depends on $.Widget
[13:41:00] <scott_gonzalez> asheppard: It's a general problem for all extensions.
[13:41:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think autocomplete got you there
[13:41:45] <arschmitz> :)
[13:41:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Where?
[13:42:29] <arschmitz> arschmitz: Well, it's not exactly a swap, because $.mobile.widget depends on $.Widget
[13:42:38] <arschmitz> pretty sure you meant asheppard didnt you?
[13:42:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right. I get it.
[13:42:58] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: Well, it's not exactly a swap, because $.mobile.widget depends on $.Widget
[13:43:05] <arschmitz> LOL!
[13:43:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep. Right. Sorry!
[13:43:29] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Sorry if I'm a bit slow ... what exactly is the general problem?
[13:43:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was just giving you a hard time because i know how much you like autocomplete for stuff in irc
[13:44:13] <asheppard> i was hoping to use sheppard but it was taken already
[13:44:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm waaay too used to addressing everything I write to a particular person. I should relax on that front.
[13:44:43] <asheppard> i think requirejs might allow per-module paths deps
[13:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> I guess if you declare every extension that you use in every file that you use them in, it's not a problem.
[13:47:08] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, yeah, you have to, otherwise how can you ensure that it will be loaded?
[13:47:08] <arschmitz> asheppard: lol at least i put my middle initial r or as would not even be enough to differentiate 
[13:47:08] <asheppard> scott_gonzalez: what is an extension in this context? different than plugin i assume
[13:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> asheppard: Basically a plugin for a plugin.
[13:47:08] <asheppard> arschmitz: yeah
[13:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> In the same way that a normal plugin extends jQuery, an extension extends a widget.
[13:47:08] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The only concept this does not cover is optional dependency, like: "Oh, you have that extension loaded? Nice! Then I'll do it the fancy way using functionality provided therein, otherwise I'll fall back to something less spectacular."
[13:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> For example, it may add a new option to an existing widget.
[13:47:08] <asheppard> scott_gonzalez: i see, makes sense
[13:47:35] <asheppard> it's cheating but you could check the $ namespace
[13:47:47] <asheppard> so if $.mobile exists, i'll do extra stuff
[13:48:11] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: No, that's bad, because $.mobile may appear later, by which time you will have done the wrong thing.
[13:48:44] <_|Nix|_> AFAI'm concerned, AMD is strictly for controlling load order.
[13:49:47] <_|Nix|_> So, if you need to provide an option for widget X, and somebody has loaded you, then obviously somebody must previously load widget X, otherwise you have nothing to which to attach your option.
[13:52:06] <_|Nix|_> We have another kind of dependency mechanism in mobile, which addresses exactly this kind of optional dependency. It's enhancement order. There are widgets which require other widgets to do their enhancement first in order to execute their own enhancement correctly. However, if you choose not to include any of those widgets in your copy of the library, then it shouldn't wait for all those would-be widgets to become enhanced.
[13:57:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry, I got side tracked... what didn't work about this solution for auto shrink? http://jsbin.com/ulexaz/24/edit
[13:57:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not so sure its what i thought it was so i need to give it a second look
[13:57:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok
[13:58:21] <asheppard> _|Nix|_: could you use a similar method for this purpose?
[13:58:53] <asheppard> _|Nix|_: wait for $.Widget to be "enhanced"
[13:59:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ah i think i know part of the issue and its fixable ill revisit tonight and we can discuss tomorrow
[14:00:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok sounds great
[14:00:49] <arschmitz> makes sense to land this along with textinput rewrite
[14:00:50] <arschmitz> so i want to get it nailed down
[14:01:00] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:01:22] <_|Nix|_> asheppard: Interesting - to treat the library itself as we treat the DOM :)
[14:03:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we should comment on that ticket for autoshrink... not sure if Jonathan started working on that solution but don't want him to do a PR for nothing
[14:04:11] <asheppard> _|Nix|_: worth exploring
[14:04:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for sure ill do it tonight once i figure out if that works or if we need to do something different
[14:04:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great, thanks!
[14:04:41] <asheppard> _|Nix|_: there is also some kind of mechanism in AMD for configuring specific modules before they load
[14:04:53] <asheppard> _|Nix|_: i've never tried it though
[14:07:14] <asheppard> http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config-moduleconfig
[14:10:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6114/files#L2R33 the button doesn't need the ui-mini class because mini style will be inherited from the wrapper that has class ui-mini
[14:11:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool i just based it off the current one which needed it ill remove that if anything else is different with new theme let me know and ill fix it
[14:14:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: will do... I think I forgot to remove it here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/textinput.js#L90
[14:14:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats why its in mine
[14:14:38] <uGoMobi> I understand
[14:15:00] <uGoMobi> it should work though https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.core.css#L237
[14:15:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup ill change and check but it should be fine
[14:15:36] <uGoMobi> mini is only about the font size now, everything else adjusts because we use em values
[14:15:44] <uGoMobi> thanks
[14:16:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: new code for textinput looks neat, nice!
[14:17:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah all nice small discreet methods no super _creat do it all method
[14:17:41] <uGoMobi> only thing I am still thinking about is that search input that requires the clear btn code
[14:17:56] <uGoMobi> just adding comment in download builder is an option
[14:18:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there are 2 ways to look at that
[14:18:27] <uGoMobi> but other option is to only add the clear btn to the search if the clear btn code is there
[14:18:28] <arschmitz> you could say search is more just about search style then clear and keep the way it ius
[14:18:50] <arschmitz> or say that clear is essentail to search and move all search stuff into clearbutton
[14:19:07] <arschmitz> just about perspective i think
[14:19:29] <uGoMobi> I am not in favor of 2nd option
[14:19:42] <arschmitz> neither am i
[14:19:51] <arschmitz> thats why i didnt write it that way to start
[14:20:34] <uGoMobi> was just thinking that if we also have the clear btn extension adding the class ui-input-has-clear in case of a search input the problem would be solved
[14:21:20] <uGoMobi> would just mean that I have to update the CSS a bit
[14:21:21] <arschmitz> yup
[14:22:35] <uGoMobi> is a bit more consistent too... as soon as the input has a clear btn you know it will have that class, no matter what input type
[14:22:41] <arschmitz> either way what ever you think is best for that im fine with just let me know if the js needs any update to match
[14:22:54] <arschmitz> true that is one think i noticed in this
[14:23:08] <arschmitz> is the special handling for search vs clear
[14:23:20] <arschmitz> but was not sure if there was css reasons for that
[14:23:29] <arschmitz> it was something i meant to ask
[14:23:52] <uGoMobi> it was more because we already did it that way and it saves adding one class in case of search input
[14:24:10] <uGoMobi> but now I am thinking of it I am in favor consistency
[14:24:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: awesome
[14:24:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so im a little confused maybe you can enlighten me
[14:24:34] <uGoMobi> okay, let's do this
[14:24:51] <uGoMobi> sure
[14:24:55] <arschmitz> i place a textarea in jsbin js fiddle nothing else its about 2 lines tall
[14:25:16] <arschmitz> i place one in a jqm page and remove all our custom css properties
[14:25:22] <arschmitz> its about 10 lines high
[14:26:08] <arschmitz> maybe its a glitch in the chrome inspector that its not properly updating the height when i uncheck a property i dont knpw
[14:26:48] <uGoMobi> I guess that must be it because without our min-height setting this shouldn't happen
[14:27:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok ill try changing the actuall css file and see what happens
[14:28:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nope removed the class still tall
[14:28:57] <uGoMobi> weird
[14:29:02] <uGoMobi> same in FF?
[14:29:08] <arschmitz> not sure let me check
[14:29:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[14:32:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so confused
[14:32:19] <arschmitz> but its completely breaking the autosize the new way
[14:32:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: shall we create a branch on the JQM repo and pull your textinput code in it?
[14:32:59] <uGoMobi> then I can give it a look and make the CSS changes for search input with class ui-input-has-clear as well
[14:33:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we can reason i have it as a pr is its easy to look at the diff and id like scott_gonzalez to look at it before i pull it in
[14:33:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but if you create a branch on JQM repo you can still do a PR
[14:34:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: true i always forget that im used to doing prs from a fork
[14:34:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, took me some time too :)
[14:34:26] <uGoMobi> it's good to do a PR
[14:34:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill push to a branch
[14:34:35] <uGoMobi> we should do that more often
[14:34:41] <uGoMobi> (talking to myself)
[14:35:36] <arschmitz> anytime its something non trivial that other people should look at as well we "SHOULD" do a pr
[14:36:08] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:36:39] <uGoMobi> we see it now with the missing methods in some widgets we added
[14:36:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i see the issue
[14:36:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah among other things 
[14:37:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: see the issue re textarea height
[14:37:19] <arschmitz> we are setting the rows on it
[14:37:36] <uGoMobi> huh do we?
[14:37:44] <arschmitz> in the demos we do for some reason
[14:37:50] <arschmitz> its in the actual html
[14:38:04] <arschmitz> it was driving me mad!
[14:38:32] <uGoMobi> ohhh
[14:38:43] <uGoMobi> I was only looking at the code in your PR
[14:39:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i was only looking at css and js and could not understand
[14:39:30] <arschmitz> but because of that when i tried to set auto it was making it huge and messing up the autoheight
[14:39:47] <uGoMobi> that I can imagine
[14:40:00] <uGoMobi> should our widget unset row attr?
[14:40:17] <uGoMobi> sorry, autogrow extension I mean
[14:40:23] <arschmitz> it will need to to use the  height auto approach
[14:41:51] <uGoMobi> right
[14:42:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm so its kinda jumpy using the auto approach
[14:43:02] <arschmitz> because we add the extra space it shrinks then grows
[14:43:21] <uGoMobi> hmm
[14:43:21] <Krinkle> https://gist.github.com/Krinkle/5872006
[14:43:24] <Krinkle> (wrong chan)
[14:43:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i could do something tricky like clone it make it visibility hidden position absolute top-1000 type deal and then check the clones height and remove then update 
[14:44:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sounds heavy
[14:44:09] <arschmitz> so we never set the actual textarea to auto just a clone get its height then update real one
[14:44:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah a bit but not bad because there is a timeout buffer
[14:44:32] <arschmitz> so it does not actual happen on every key stroke
[14:45:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: other option is to remove the extra line we add
[14:45:32] <arschmitz> so it will fit exact instead of exact plus 1 line
[14:45:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when you say "extra space", do you mean the 15px?
[14:45:47] <arschmitz> yes
[14:46:29] <arschmitz> hmm maybe it was in my head
[14:46:44] <arschmitz> it looks ok when i just try it again ill need someone else to look after i put in branch lol
[14:46:54] <uGoMobi> haha, ok
[14:47:13] <arschmitz> i think the scrollbar showing for a sec messes with me
[14:47:26] <uGoMobi> why is it again that we add 15px to the height and not just add more padding bottom?
[14:47:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no idea
[14:48:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but this concept for resize i like 2 lines instead of like 15
[14:48:47] <arschmitz> and i have it working smooth now i think
[14:49:00] <uGoMobi> I like that too
[14:49:21] <arschmitz> not to mention it shrinks
[14:49:32] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:49:59] <uGoMobi> adding 15px to the height or set more padding bottom doesn't make a difference BTW
[14:50:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is one think in textinput still that REALLY annoys me
[14:50:22] <uGoMobi> we would have to distract from the padding in the calculation
[14:50:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what is that?
[14:50:39] <arschmitz> it depends on the support tests which 
[14:51:24] <arschmitz> it should not it uses 1.0 touchOverflow test to detect ios 5
[14:51:44] <uGoMobi> ah, that one
[14:52:20] <arschmitz> yeah just to turn off autocorrect
[14:52:23] <arschmitz> if its ios5
[14:53:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: anyway i gotta run
[14:53:17] <arschmitz> talk to you tomorrow
[14:53:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, good night!
