[06:06:27] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: morning
[06:06:35] <lisa_deluca> I missed what you said earlier, just had a notification but didn't tell me what you said
[06:06:49] <arschmitz> i have no idea let me scroll back lol
[06:07:10] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: having some connection problems this morning?
[06:08:25] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: you killed by backscroll with all your joining and leaving
[06:08:38] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: do you remember the last thing you said to me lol?
[06:13:49] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: I sent a few requests to add labels to some github issues and then asked if you'd give me permission so I didn't have to bug you about it
[06:14:04] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: oh yeah
[06:14:09] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: my IRC channel has a mind of it's own
[06:14:30] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: so label rights are directly connected to commit access
[06:15:03] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: ah, okay
[06:15:24] <arschmitz> which is one nice thing about UI using trac they are separate so they can give non team members access to help on issues 
[06:15:37] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: but using github issues we can't. 
[06:15:51] <arschmitz> so you will just have to keep bugging me for now
[06:16:02] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: okay, I will
[06:19:12] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: what's your email to forward you an email?
[06:19:39] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: i just pm'ed it to you

[07:42:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: cool
[07:42:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: want to land lisa_deluca's as well
[07:42:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Can do.
[07:43:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: there is no response from jasper on either of those but im going to say they are both good

[07:43:24] <arschmitz> reset active page height
[07:43:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: There's precedent for my solution in popup.
[07:43:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes and its just css after its closed
[07:43:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... in fact, the motivation for doing the clip with popup might've been the same.
[07:43:51] <arschmitz> its not like changeing logic or anything
[07:43:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Nope.
[07:44:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I wrote an exhaustive test for resetActivePageHeight().
[07:44:15] <arschmitz> ok
[07:44:32] <arschmitz> so you did get a test when i checked there was not one

[08:48:21] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: yeah there are tons i know if i just had a few hours i could fix
[08:49:14] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: just gotta find the right ones that are in parts of the code that either are not too complicated or your already semi familiar with 
[08:50:17] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: and just branch out from there
[08:50:52] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: i think my first like 5 prs that landed were all on like 1 or 2 related components 
[08:51:27] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: yea, reproducing and using jquery is a lot easier than trying to figure out how to issue a fix.  But at least there are other eyes verifying the PRs 
[08:52:09] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: yeah dont worry if you do it wrong just do a pr and at the very least we can point you in the right direction from there

[09:55:01] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[09:55:12] <arschmitz> :-p
[09:55:47] <scott_gonzalez> What can I say? We're just some ancient project that's full of bloat and moves at glacial speed.
[09:55:56] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: lol
[09:56:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We need to start removing those AMD modules which simply include other AMD modules ... we have core.js and events.js ...
[09:56:27] <scott_gonzalez> I'm about to create one of those!
[09:56:57] <gseguin> gabriel_schulhof: why do you want to remove them?
[09:57:13] <gabriel_schulhof> gseguin: Lemme find the issue for you.
[09:57:30] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: just because one gets used wrong in a place does not mean it should not exist
[09:58:11] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I suppose they can continue to exist, but we must not refer to them from other of our modules.
[09:58:31] <gabriel_schulhof> gseguin: If you remove touch events, you lose all of navigation and init.
[09:58:48] <gabriel_schulhof> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7805
[09:59:32] <gabriel_schulhof> That's a bigger problem than just pagecontainer and navigation.js depending on events.js instead of the individual events, but the latter is a part of the problem.
[10:00:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Also, I'm not sure if we need/want the extra checkboxes in the download builder.
[10:00:39] <gabriel_schulhof> In the case of events.js, it binds together completely unrelated things like touch events and the navigate event.
[10:01:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we can most certainly refer to them from other modules 
[10:01:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: just because there is a problem with how something is used does not mean it should not be used 
[10:01:35] <arschmitz> it means you need to use it properly 
[10:01:45] <arschmitz> if something really depends on the whole module its fine
[10:01:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: If you have a widget that needs vclick and you include events.js instead of events/touch.js, you get the navigate event for absolutely no reason.
[10:02:09] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: right thats improper usage
[10:02:38] <arschmitz> that does not mean events.js should not be used by something that really depends on all of it
[10:03:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: If it's something internal to the library, I think it should pull its deps directly. The reason I say that is that if events.js ever changes, then the dependencies of the given component will change unnecessarily.
[10:04:19] <gabriel_schulhof> Also, we included core.js purely for historical reasons.
[10:05:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, and there's one thing I'm unclear about: Have we established whether our list of AMD modules is part of our API or not?
[10:06:00] <gabriel_schulhof> That is, if we shuffle our code, eliminating some modules and creating others, do we need a period of deprecation?
[10:06:10] <gabriel_schulhof> The presence of core.js would certainly seem to indicate that.
[10:15:26] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, sorry the delay, it looks good to me
[10:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks rxaviers.
[10:39:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We don't intend to do anything about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7787 (translate our outward-facing strings), right? So can I close that issue?
[10:40:27] <arschmitz> id like to create a doc on the api documenting them and how to change them
[10:40:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: How about a demo?
[10:41:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I can make a demo. I can do the Finnish translation :)
[10:41:17] <arschmitz> prefer api
[10:41:21] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[10:41:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Complete with i18n framework?
[10:41:37] <arschmitz> you can do a demo as well showing a fully translated page
[10:41:53] <arschmitz> but in regards to that issue i want an api page
[10:41:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... I was just gonna set things during mobileinit.
[10:42:16] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats fine to just set during mobile init thats what i would do
[10:42:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Of course, that does not support on-the-fly translation.
[10:42:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: nope
[10:43:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: how complicated you want to make the demo is up to you
[10:43:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Right. I'm just thinking ... with the classes option, you can tag the various UI elements for on-the-fly translation.
[10:45:00] <gabriel_schulhof> ... so this may be a good shakedown for the classes option too ...

[12:42:58] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: are you talking about tap toggle or hide on focus
[12:43:07] <lisa_deluca> tap toggle
[12:43:15] <lisa_deluca> notice how the header and footer are disappearing
[12:43:25] <arschmitz> right but they do that when you focus an input too
[12:43:40] <lisa_deluca> but i didn't, i just clicked between input fields
[12:44:10] <arschmitz> why all the inputs then?
[12:44:23] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: just using the jsbin file the guy created

[12:52:21] <lisa_deluca> alright, let me correct his and see if that fixes it
[12:52:36] <arschmitz> thats what the one i just posted is
[12:53:15] <lisa_deluca> yea, i meant run in a cordova app as well
[12:53:17] <lisa_deluca> since he's seeing on android

[17:21:35] <Omar-> hi everyone
[17:22:44] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof arschmitz
[17:22:56] <Omar-> I have a proposal/feature request
[18:01:15] <arschmitz> Omar-: what is it?
[18:01:24] <Omar-> hi arschmitz
[18:01:32] <Omar-> regarding ui-content div
[18:02:18] <Omar-> do you think its a good idea to make it fill screen height in spite of contents within?
[18:02:25] <Omar-> for at least fixed footer
[18:02:46] <arschmitz> no
[18:03:14] <arschmitz> it should not do that
[18:03:38] <Omar-> a min-height like page
[18:03:45] <arschmitz> no it should not
[18:03:50] <Omar-> viewport to be specific
[18:03:54] <arschmitz> no
[18:04:14] <Omar-> so you want it to stretch according to contents
[18:04:22] <arschmitz> yes
[18:04:23] <Omar-> ok, it was just a thought
[18:04:42] <arschmitz> Omar-: ui-content is just a class to add padding
[18:04:50] <arschmitz> its used in more then just pages
[18:05:04] <Omar-> I know, but it's always main part for page's contents
[18:05:20] <arschmitz> thats not a rule by any means
[18:05:31] <arschmitz> there is no need to have a content div
[18:06:18] <arschmitz> its just a class that adds padding and overflow-x hidden
[18:06:23] <arschmitz> thats all it does
[18:06:51] <arschmitz> it can be used in popups
[18:06:54] <arschmitz> collapsibles
[18:06:55] <arschmitz> panels
[18:12:10] <Omar-> arschmitz I understand that, it tides up all contents
[18:12:13] <Omar-> very useful
[18:16:08] <Omar-> honestly, I dont remember using jQM without content div
[18:16:24] <Omar-> I'll try it now without
[18:17:16] <Omar-> you may want to see this too http://plnkr.co/users/JQM-Forum/plunks
[18:17:36] <Omar-> we are preparing templates for jQM users/help seekers
[18:17:50] <Omar-> for jquery form
[18:17:53] <Omar-> forum*
[18:39:46] <Omar-> goodnight everyone
[18:39:48] <Omar-> bye arschmitz
