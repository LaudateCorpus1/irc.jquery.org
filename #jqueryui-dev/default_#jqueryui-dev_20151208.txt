[09:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> I need to update the Trac settings. I think it's as simple as changing the protocol, but right now we're not getting any info from Trac.
[09:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> Well, changing protocols fixed the Trac problem. I'm getting a BOM in the output, but that'll get deleted anyway.

[09:34:45] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna do some testing with the generated files and look over them some more.
[09:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> And it occurs to me now that you're in Portland, so you're probably sleeping.

[11:07:23] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right.
[11:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> Confusing two conferences that are going on right now.
[11:09:17] <jzaefferer> GitHub doesn't like to render a 500kb js file ( https://github.com/jquery/fake-cdn/blob/master/cdn/ui/1.12.0-beta.1/jquery-ui.js )
[11:12:47] <jzaefferer> CDN files looks okay, TR URLs work (tested a few).
[11:14:05] <jzaefferer> Even the base theme works fine, despite not being part of 1.11...
