[05:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: It puts a smile on my face to see the Twitter Bootstrap accordion cause content below it to shift during animation :-P
[05:57:25] <scott_gonzalez> COLORS! http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/29
[06:08:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: LOL!
[06:10:10] <kborchers> colors are awesome! so are they red > 25, yellow >= 10 and green < 10 ?
[06:37:30] <scott_gonzalez> The cutoffs are 10 and 20
[06:38:14] <kborchers> yeah, i guess that makes sense ... doesn't matter still a good quick glance at ticket status
[06:38:31] <kborchers> sortable FTW :P
[06:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, It's in the lead :-)
[06:39:40] <kborchers> speaking of which, where is dave at on rewriting those interactions (draggable, droppable, etc.)?
[06:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> I just added brighter green for 0.
[06:39:49] <kborchers> nice!
[06:40:00] <scott_gonzalez> I made a lot of progress on draggable and droppable last month.
[06:40:21] <kborchers> so is he pretty much not working on those any more?
[06:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> They work with mouse, touch and MSPointer now :-)
[06:40:43] <scott_gonzalez> He still plans on working on interactions. I think he's just been really busy.
[06:41:06] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go help my wife pack, she's going to PA for the weekend to help her parents move into their new house.
[06:41:15] <kborchers> cool, later
[11:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: Do you have any idea on a rough number of BrowserStack hours needed to run all of our tests for a month?
[11:20:50] <clarkbox> no
[11:20:55] <clarkbox> i could log it
[11:21:05] <scott_gonzalez> Would that be easy to setup?
[11:21:06] <clarkbox> wouldnt be hard to add to the script
[11:21:11] <clarkbox> i can do that this weekend
[11:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> Cool. Would be good for us just to get an idea of how much value we're getting.
[18:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yt?
[23:22:16] <Qalqi> Is this channel intended for development of JqueryUI only?
[23:22:57] <Qalqi> can we ask Jq UI tweaking related questions?
