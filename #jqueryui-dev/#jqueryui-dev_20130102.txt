[01:08:30] <Krinkle> Are there any plans to support different button styles natively (so that it can be expected in different jquery ui themes)
[01:08:43] <Krinkle> e.g. a button for positive, deconstructive actions like bootstrap has.
[01:09:00] <Krinkle> (with an icon and/or different background color_)
[01:09:31] <Krinkle> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#buttons
[01:10:05] <Krinkle> at least a "primary" distinction would be useful
[01:14:19] <Krinkle> I'm allergic to trac

[05:46:01] <rxaviers> hi scott_gonzalez, good morning
[05:46:05] <rxaviers> can we scope this? https://github.com/rxaviers/web-base-template/commit/71ec6c181746eef50144f3722246ac35d2868d20
[05:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> hey rxaviers
[05:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> probably
[05:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[05:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I think we only use input[type=search] outside of #content.
[05:46:58] <rxaviers> that's another style tricky to counter act
[05:47:26] <rxaviers> so, hard to scope?
[05:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so, I just need to do some checking.
[05:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...the search bar actually does use <input type="text">
[05:53:46] <rxaviers> so far that's the only place I see using it
[05:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> But we can just update the styles for that.
[05:54:07] <rxaviers> cool
[05:54:53] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, it doesn't look like the search field even changes when that rule is scoped.
[05:54:55] <rxaviers> shall we update style of line 1382 or scope the one in line 500?
[05:55:20] <rxaviers> very few styles are not overwritten
[05:55:37] <rxaviers> it's only: border-radius, and min-width
[05:56:33] <rxaviers> if we are sure it's not used somewhere else, it seems a good idea only porting those styles to nav#main ... input one and drop the latter
[05:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> You want to drop the general one?
[05:57:59] <rxaviers> would if not used. But, I dont know if it is
[05:58:05] <scott_gonzalez> Don't drop it.
[05:58:10] <scott_gonzalez> Just scope it behind #content.
[05:58:27] <rxaviers> ok
[06:03:12] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, and you know what.. It seems removing the min-width: 300px of the search input fixed the remaining scrollable empty thing on the right
[06:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> interesting
[06:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf gnarf gnarf

[08:20:45] <rxaviers> cool thks
[08:23:12] <tj_vantoll> Meeting today?
[08:33:41] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez ^
[08:33:49] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:53:58] <rxaviers> mikesherov, scott_gonzalez, I may have misunderstood the bug case, but I still don't get why the need of such observation comments in the  demos.
[08:54:06] <rxaviers> UI supports older core versions, ok. So, it's possible for a user using new UI to find older-core-bugs. Ok.
[08:54:11] <rxaviers> If he does find, he could open a bug against core and that's what we are concerned about. Right?
[08:54:46] <rxaviers> Even though, UI supports older cores. It's not in UI's scope to address fixes for those bugs, except internally for making all UI components to work properly.
[08:55:35] <rxaviers> So, if a user complains about an old outerWidth bug. We should simply let him know, he's using an outdated version of core even though UI supports it.
[08:55:36] <rxaviers> Right?
[08:55:47] <scott_gonzalez> No, you're misunderstanding.
[08:55:54] <scott_gonzalez> There are no bugs in .outerWidth() in core.
[08:56:01] <scott_gonzalez> There *is* a bug in old UI with new core.
[08:56:28] <scott_gonzalez> We released a version of UI that worked with new core before core did their release.
[08:56:47] <scott_gonzalez> In the blog post for the core release, DaveMethvin made it very clear that you must upgrade UI if you're going to upgrade core.
[08:56:58] <scott_gonzalez> Then people went ahead and ignored it and filed bugs.
[08:57:00] <scott_gonzalez> Over and over and over.
[08:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> That's unrelated.
[08:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing I'm concerned about is someone looking at a UI demo, copying the code and having it fail because they're using an older, but supported, version of core.
[09:01:05] <rxaviers> got it.. it's the "upper limit" .. 
[09:14:09] <rxaviers> User thinks that UI should work with a newer core version  (as he should) and in this case it doesn't.
[09:15:52] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's silly to think that and old UI would work with a new major version of core.
[09:16:33] <rxaviers> In this case, users files a bug against core or UI?
[09:16:39] <rxaviers> users file*
[09:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> core
[09:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> The bug appears to be in core because UI overwrites core methods.
[09:17:28] <rxaviers> If user files a bug against core, he always need to check if he is testing an up-to-date version.
[09:17:39] <rxaviers> nevermind
[09:18:05] <rxaviers> it is
[09:18:25] <rxaviers> that's an interesting case.
[09:18:38] <rxaviers> Do you think adding the comment in every demos would solve it? It is, avoiding the user to file a bug against core?
[09:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> No, I think they're completely unrelated problems.
[09:19:57] <rxaviers> So, what is the comment going to solve?
[09:20:07] <scott_gonzalez> People using old core with new UI.
[09:20:18] <scott_gonzalez> And having it fail because the demo uses new core APIs.
[09:20:33] <rxaviers> What about stating in the download page that legacy supports from jQuery X to Y?
[09:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> That has nothing to do with people copying code from a demo.
[09:20:51] <rxaviers> That's where I would look
[09:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> It's not about what versions of core we support.
[09:21:07] <rxaviers> ?
[09:21:11] <scott_gonzalez> It's about what versions of core the demo code works with.
[09:21:13] <rxaviers> Isnt what you just said before?
[09:21:40] <rxaviers> not only the demo. But, UI.
[09:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> This is a user who already has core and UI in their project.
[09:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> They see a demo that does what they want.
[09:22:03] <scott_gonzalez> They copy the code and it fails.
[09:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> That's the only problem we're concerned with.
[09:24:01] <rxaviers> Do you think we should have the comments on each demo, or the demo suffices since it explicitly includes versioned jquery src?
[09:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov was saying to include it in every demo.
[09:24:37] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's fine if we only do it on jqueryui.com, not inside jquery-ui.
[09:24:42] <scott_gonzalez> That way it can be automated.
[09:26:50] <rxaviers> well, it's up to you guys.
[09:27:02] <rxaviers> But, I don't think this is the right place to do it.
[09:27:09] <rxaviers> this is totally overhead
[09:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> What's overhead?
[09:30:10] <rxaviers> yeap, I think it's way over to state that in every demo in favor of a user that copies new demos and pastes it on old wrapper html without noticing that.
[09:30:25] <rxaviers> but,I may be wrong
[09:30:32] <rxaviers> maybe we have more users of that type than I think
[09:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> It'd only be in the source code, not visible on the page.
[09:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> My main objection to adding a notice is that I don't want it to be on the page.
[09:31:11] <rxaviers> I am not saying we should not notify people about that. Just that we should find a better place.
[09:32:42] <rxaviers> places where we state about version support should be up-to-date about that.
[09:33:20] <scott_gonzalez> It's not about what versions we support though.
[09:33:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's about what version the demo supports.
[09:33:49] <rxaviers> it's about old UI not supporting newer core, isnt it?
[09:33:51] <scott_gonzalez> That's the big question: Should demos support all the versions of core that UI supports.
[09:33:55] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:34:04] <scott_gonzalez> That's not what we're talking about.
[09:34:07] <scott_gonzalez> It's about new UI and old core.
[09:34:11] <scott_gonzalez> Not old UI.
[09:34:23] <scott_gonzalez> You can't view an old UI demo.
[09:34:53] <agcolom> hi!
[09:35:07] <rxaviers> New UI supports core [1.7+ and on] right?
[09:35:37] <scott_gonzalez> 1.6+
[09:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> Hi agcolom
[09:36:14] <agcolom> Hi scott_gonzalez! 
[09:38:08] <agcolom> In mobile, on the 1st page we say: For jQuery 1.7.0 to 1.8.2. http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/ 
[09:38:43] <agcolom> and then on http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/about/getting-started.html we say jQuery Mobile 1.2 (1.2.0) works with versions of jQuery core from 1.7.0 to 1.8.2.
[09:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> No 1.8.3 support? :-P
[09:41:15] <agcolom> I know ;-) 1.2.0 is stable, so I don't think we can change that... maybe in 1.2.1 ;-) I'm not sure it's all been fully tested with 1.8.3 yet... (been relaxing a bit ;-) )
[09:41:25] <agcolom> I have ^ (been relaxing)
[09:43:32] <agcolom> then probably 1.3.0 
[09:46:21] <rxaviers> There are two scenarios: (a) new UI vs old core issue, (b) old UI, new core  issue (eg: .outerWidth()). On scenario (a), let's say a user has core 1.6 and newest UI. He finds a bug. He should not file it against core, because it's an old core (as we state in http://bugs.jquery.com/newticket). But, he shall file anything against UI since we support 1.6 core.
[09:48:22] <rxaviers> The above flow has enough comments in my opinion and reinforcing that in each demo or source code is redundant imho
[09:50:25] <scott_gonzalez> We're not talking about either of those scenarios.
[09:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> We're talking about code with no bugs, but doesn't work.
[09:51:14] <scott_gonzalez> For example: `element.on( "click", ... )` has 0 bugs and will not work with jQuery 1.6.
[09:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> There is no bug to report, because everything in UI and core works properly.
[09:52:06] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing that doesn't work is our demo code with their version of core.
[09:52:08] <rxaviers> Right, take that example. If user copies and pastes the demo, it will work. Because the demo includes <script src> tag
[09:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> They won't copy that part.
[09:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> They already have jQuery.
[09:52:53] <scott_gonzalez> Nobody copy/pastes the <script src> tags.
[09:53:01] <scott_gonzalez> Because they'd need the source files to do that.
[09:57:45] <rxaviers> My though on that:
[09:57:46] <rxaviers> That happens and will cause frustration to those users. But, those users have their own existing project code to use as demo for older code, and usually that's what they do anyway. If they find a problem, nothing as bad as googling about it and they will find the jQuery page mentioning that such method is >=X version (like mentioned). So, they pick to using the deprecated or to upgrading it.
[09:58:38] <rxaviers> I think adding a disclosure comment on each demo is too much and makes reading the demo harder.
[09:59:47] <rxaviers> thought*

[11:10:57] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: when we declare options in the main $.widget, are we supposed to specify eventName: null for all method names?
[11:11:16] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: dialog does this, and things like button don't
[11:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> For all events, yeah.
[11:11:33] <mikesherov> autocomplete does, draggable doesn't...
[11:11:38] <mikesherov> so those are just out of date?
[11:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, interactions are probably all out of date.
[11:12:04] <mikesherov> and the preferred format is the format in autocomplete and dialog, where they are listed under //callbacks
[11:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> Button doesn't have any events.
[11:12:36] <mikesherov> Oh, well then, that makes sense :-)
[11:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> Other than create, which has its default defined in widget.
[11:12:43] <mikesherov> right
[11:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[11:13:18] <mikesherov> ok, I'm just going through all the *_common.js unit tests, making sure they're all right
[11:13:32] <scott_gonzalez> I think we'll eventually do something like: events: [ "start", "drag", "stop" ] because other libs like Ember and Juice can benefit from knowing which options are events.
[11:13:35] <mikesherov> I'll update any widgets that don't match their documented interfaces

[11:32:29] <Dave_Stein> i was just gonna say
[11:32:31] <mikesherov> I'm in the process now of fixing all the *_common.js tests
[11:32:35] <Dave_Stein> got a message 222 hours ago ha
[11:32:42] <Dave_Stein> thats the thing scott said to remove since it wasnt documented
[11:33:00] <mikesherov> then scott_gonzalez told me to keep it (might as well) for backCompat
[11:33:12] <mikesherov> so I ported those over

[11:33:27] <mikesherov> tests are fixed in master and interactions
[11:33:34] <Dave_Stein> ok

[11:35:18] <mikesherov> but there is also the issue of TestHelpers.draggable.setScroll and $(document)
[11:35:23] <Dave_Stein> hm maybe i am confusing the options.... it was cursorAt using array
[11:35:29] <Dave_Stein> those failing tests that didnt have documentation on the site
[11:35:39] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: draggable is borked when page is scrolled
[11:35:55] <mikesherov> I had to comment that out to get the suite to pass after giving up after 2 hours of frustration
[11:36:09] <Dave_Stein> you know i thought it had funny behavior but then i saw the same behavior in the old one... which condition? just normal scrolling with all defaults?
[11:36:32] <mikesherov> uncomment that line and you'll see all the delicious red
[11:36:38] <Dave_Stein> haha ok
[11:36:46] <mikesherov> 			// todo: currently, the draggable interaction doesn't properly account for scrolled pages,
[11:36:47] <mikesherov> 			// uncomment the line below to make the tests fail that should when the page is scrolled
[11:36:48] <mikesherov> 			// $(document).scrollTop(100); $(document).scrollLeft(100);
[11:36:48] <Dave_Stein> more tests for me to have fun with now i suppose
[11:36:51] <mikesherov> yes
[11:37:00] <mikesherov> I'm aiming for full coverage of interactions
[11:37:09] <Dave_Stein> its a good goal
[11:37:13] <Dave_Stein> i think we can make it happen
[11:37:17] <mikesherov> yup
[11:37:25] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Also how is grid supposed to function? Without looking it seemed it should snap at the halfway point but the unit test suggsted otherwise
[11:37:43] <Dave_Stein> so if my grid is 50, snap over at 25
[11:37:58] <Dave_Stein> the grid test makes it seem like one pixel will do something
[11:39:01] <Dave_Stein> also since 2.0 is supporting jquery <2.0 we need to support ie6 right
[11:39:35] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: 1.10 doesn't support IE6
[11:39:47] <mikesherov> so you just need IE7+
[11:39:59] <mikesherov> "just"
[11:40:24] <Dave_Stein> i just yelled yes and did a fist pump in the air
[11:40:25] <Dave_Stein> whoops
[11:40:26] <Dave_Stein> haha
[11:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: grid should work however it works now.
[11:40:50] <scott_gonzalez> We don't support IE6.
[11:41:20] <Dave_Stein> ah ok good good
[11:41:42] <Dave_Stein> i was trying to avoid the older code so i'll take a clsoer look at how it's working which is hard to translate given it's not internal anymore
[11:43:29] <Dave_Stein> Although I did just end up copy-pasting one of the backCompats that had that insanity line
[11:43:42] <Dave_Stein> of like x < y && x2 > y2 - except like that 6 or more of those in a row
[11:47:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the crazy snapping code?
[11:48:34] <mikesherov> the "yes, I know this is insane ;-)" code
[11:49:26] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: because slider extends $.ui.mouse, it's documentation should mention the options "cancel", "delay", and "distance", right?

[13:11:43] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez mikesherov do we have any timelines for interactions yet or is it just going as we can make it like now?
[13:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[13:16:41] <Dave_Stein> so after 1.12 but no dates in between?
[13:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> The roadmap is fluid.
[13:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing that's guaranteed is all interactions are in 2.0.
[13:17:26] <Dave_Stein> haha
[13:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> What's in 1.11 and 1.12 is subjet to chagne.
[13:17:43] <Dave_Stein> ok
[13:17:47] <scott_gonzalez> Whether 2.0 is after 1.12 or 1.13 is subject to change...
[13:17:54] <scott_gonzalez> But all interactions will be in 2.0.
[13:17:57] <Dave_Stein> i told mike via email ill be working on the outstanding draggable things probably next week since its a short work week here
[13:18:41] <Dave_Stein> im annoyed i dont know why grunt is failing on my home pc despite being the same setup as here... dave even had checked that grunt wasn't upgraded yet in UI cause he thought that might be it 
[13:19:01] <Dave_Stein> it was complaining about some spawn, which seemed like the .4 glitch i saw being worked on

[16:37:58] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh.
