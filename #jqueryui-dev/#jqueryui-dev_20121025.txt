[05:58:00] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: still working on the position test failures
[05:58:13] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: do you know when the last successful build was?
[06:00:09] <erethnor> hiya - was wondering if Globalize could use some dev help since I see there have been just a couple "maintainance" patches in the last few months?
[06:01:01] <mikesherov> erethnor: scott_gonzalez might now ^
[06:01:16] <mikesherov> or gnarf maybe
[06:01:50] <mikesherov> erethnor: you can always work on the issues listed here: https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues
[06:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> erethnor: We can definitely use some help.
[06:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> Our big focus will be during the jQuery UI 1.11 release phase, but we'd love to have work start now.
[06:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> The biggest thing we'd like to do is change the data source to CLDR.
[06:04:06] <erethnor> mikesherov: I did work on one of those issues and done a pull request a few months ago that I'd love to have in the master, part of the reason I'm asking :)
[06:04:32] <mikesherov> oh, cool. link?
[06:04:46] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/112
[06:05:34] <mikesherov> erethnor: I have a few comments
[06:05:41] <erethnor> scott_gonzalez: I've seen a bunch of tickets about that and would like to help, although I'm not sure how you'd like to do that? Do you want to get rid of the .net localization files builder?
[06:06:52] <mikesherov> erethnor: first, when issuing pull requests, you should be working out of a branch, not master. That way you can rebase your pull request rather than having all of those merges
[06:07:07] <mikesherov> working out of master makes it hard to stay up to date
[06:08:14] <mikesherov> erethnor: actually, I'm going to comment directly on the PR
[06:08:53] <erethnor> mikesherov: please do, I can definitely learn a lot about git still :)
[06:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> erethnor: Unfortunately we don't have a maintainer for Globalize right now.
[06:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> At some point I'll start maintaining it, and then people will actually get responses when they file issues or PRs.
[06:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> We definitely need a way to address the existing ones though.
[06:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> Right now, I'm not familiar with the code at all.

[06:11:43] <erethnor> scott_gonzalez: I've worked with it a fair bit and could help
[06:11:58] <scott_gonzalez> erethnor: That'd be great.
[06:12:09] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Are you reviewing the PR or just sending him feedback around the PR process?
[06:12:23] <mikesherov> feedback
[06:13:28] <erethnor> if keeping the .net builder would be okay, I could look into how to make it get the data directly from CLDR rather than .net locale
[06:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> The end goal is to not use .net at all.
[06:16:08] <erethnor> mmm that could probably be done with grunt then
[06:26:22] <scott_gonzalez> erethnor: If you split up your pull request after mikesherov leaves feedback, I'll try to review everything.
[06:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be on vacation all next week though.

[07:08:43] <DaveMethvin> 1.9.1 already? Seems like only yesterday 1.9 was born.
[07:12:19] <petersendidit> Man http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph sure is pretty
[07:16:42] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov won't be satisfied until the UI bug graph tracks the Facebook stock graph
[07:17:04] <petersendidit> lol
[07:18:46] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: jzaefferer seemed to be obsessed with getting 1.9.1 out.
[07:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> He's doing the release right now.
[07:19:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm watching over his shoulder :-P
[07:19:11] <DaveMethvin> go jzaefferer!
[07:41:40] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: want to do anything with this http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4812 looks like its been fixed by Firefox in newer version from my tests
[07:43:46] <jzaefferer> man, creating that changelog is still a lot of work, and 1.9.1 has just ~40 tickets
[07:45:34] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Just using the existing demo to test?
[07:46:10] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, if you can confirm that it's broken in old Firefox and working in new Firefox, you can close as wontfix because we don't support those versions anymore.
[07:46:19] <tj_vantoll> Looking at an old resizable bug (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4596).  The complaint is essentially that when resizable needs to create a wrapper element (in this case for a textarea) that the wrapper element has padding applied to it which can break layouts.
[07:46:19] <tj_vantoll> My thought was that this is kind of core to how resizable works and isn't something we really can fix.  If you really need to override the padding .ui-wrapper { padding: 0 !important; } will work.  Agreed?
[07:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Looking now.
[07:55:11] <tj_vantoll> Here's his test case cleaned up and fsFiddle-ified http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/EV6Qq/
[07:56:36] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I think it makes sense to put the resizer on top of the element.
[07:56:53] <scott_gonzalez> That's what native resizable textareas do.
[07:59:22] <tj_vantoll> Makes sense.  There's another resizable ticket more along those lines so I'll probably note that and close #4596 as a duplicate.  Thanks.
[08:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think jzaefferer is ever going to do another release.

[10:34:26] <Wilto> scott_gonzalez: This what we’re talkin’ about? http://wil.to/progress/
[10:34:48] <Wilto> Or like… full width for “indeterminate?”
[10:35:26] <Wilto> Oh, look in a WebKit for now.
[10:37:08] <scott_gonzalez> Wilto: Yes, that, but it'd always be full width.
[10:37:16] <Wilto> Gotcha.
[10:38:41] <scott_gonzalez> Wilto: It needs to work in IE7 :-)
[10:38:48] <Wilto> So does this need to be an overlay?
[10:39:16] <Wilto> Yeah, for that… animated gifs?
[10:39:18] <Wilto> I got nothin’ there.
[10:39:43] <Wilto> We had an all-CSS loading indicator in jQM for a while, but we had to roll it back to a crummy ol’ gif.
[10:41:47] <Wilto> We ended up using this one, if memory serves: http://wil.to/_/i-choose-you.gif
[10:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> Todd replied on that PR again, it sounds like he was thinking we'd generate the images, though I'm not sure if we can generate animated gifs in TR.
[10:42:29] <scott_gonzalez> Does Mobile generate themed animated gifs?
[10:43:02] <Wilto> No, we just set a half-ish opacity on the loading spinner, so it blends with whatever the backdrop uses for theming.
[10:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling that wouldn't work too well with the rounded corners on progressbars.
[10:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> I guess if we just round the corner on the div with the background it should work though.
[10:44:48] <Wilto> You could use a background.
[10:44:52] <Wilto> Yep, exactly.
[10:45:09] <Wilto> That way you don’t have scaling issues, either, depending on the size of the progress bar.
[10:47:12] <Wilto> To preserve the underlying progress bar theming (which I figure probably uses images), you probably wanna just generate a div with the animated gif background and overlay it on top of the progress bar, in indeterminate cases.
[10:47:22] <Wilto> And strip out the ARIA business.
[10:49:53] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, we'll play with that. Thanks.
[10:50:41] <Wilto> Oh, and then you can mess around with the opacity, once the animation is in its own element.
[10:54:29] <toddmparker> hey all
[10:54:31] <Wilto> UGH here’s TODD now.
[10:54:43] <toddmparker> ok, leaving...
[10:55:07] <Wilto> You’re welcome, UI.
[10:55:15] <toddmparker> what's this i hear about not using css animations here in the good year 2012?
[10:58:48] <scott_gonzalez> Something about IE...
[11:02:39] <toddmparker> blech.

[11:47:21] <tj_vantoll> Looking for opinions on what to do with #7766 when someone has a minute.
[11:47:21] <tj_vantoll> Essentially the bug says that resizable is using css('margin') internally and it should be using css('marginTop'), css('marginBottom'), etc…
[11:47:21] <tj_vantoll> Using css('margin') doesn't appear to be creating any actual issues.

[12:34:22] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: for http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4672 I am guessing we are wanting to enhance the refresh method to work like the tabs refresh method does
[12:34:55] <petersendidit> seems it would have to be like tabs for it to work correctly

[13:25:17] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/selectmenu] Selectmenu: fixed aria-activedescendant for button element - Felix Nagel
[13:25:17] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/selectmenu] Selectmenu tests: aria-activedescendant für button - Felix Nagel
[14:06:22] <jzaefferer> gnarf: making effects use clip instead of wrapper will fix a bunch of accessbility problems, e.g. an animated dialog gets read twice when using blind and other wrapper-based effects
[14:06:37] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yes
[14:09:08] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: when is a good time to ask you something about the api docs? (if you're busy now it can wait tomorrow or next week...)
[14:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a few minutes now.
[14:11:04] <agcolom> ok, say this page: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[14:12:00] <agcolom> the description goes: Description: Convert a pair of headers and content panels into an accordion.
[14:12:23] <agcolom> (convert, not converts)
[14:13:08] <agcolom> so most verbs are in the infinitive... (we do the same with mobile)
[14:13:56] <agcolom> but for options eg. disable, it goes: Disables the accordion if set to true.
[14:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ^
[14:14:41] <agcolom> same thing for methods: destroy()
[14:14:41] <agcolom> Removes the accordion functionality completely.
[14:15:23] <agcolom> I have the same issue/uncertainty with mobile...
[14:15:49] <agcolom> So that's why I'd like to check and see whether we can adopt a rule...
[14:16:09] <agcolom> (also as English is not my 1st language, I don't really know which one is best)
[14:16:15] <jzaefferer> agcolom: Sounds like you could just tell us what to use, we just made things up along the way.
[14:16:26] <jzaefferer> Or wait for kswedberg to respond.
[14:16:35] <jzaefferer> He's the (former) english teacher after all.
[14:17:04] <agcolom> jzaefferer: Yes, sounds like a good plan... I like consistency (sorry ;-) )
[14:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> As far as I know, the way that options and methods are written is the standard way API docs are written.
[14:17:38] <scott_gonzalez> But most API docs don't have the general description section.
[14:17:52] <jzaefferer> We like consistency, too. Its good you pointed that out.
[14:17:58] <jzaefferer> REFACTOR ALL THE DOCS!
[14:18:34] <agcolom> I have been wondering this for the mobile doc sfor a while, so thought I'd check yours ;-)
[14:18:50] <agcolom> (and copy your style ;-) )
[14:19:49] <agcolom> jzaefferer: I hope you've got a warm coat for when you come back to Europe! There will be frost this weekend!
[14:21:06] <agcolom> Have a good evening.... and think it's bedtime for me!
[14:21:35] <agcolom> sorry the and should not be there! ^ I should be there instead!
[14:21:39] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Did you notice our new examples?
[14:21:50] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-active
[14:22:16] <jzaefferer> agcolom: thanks. Yeah, I've got a good jacket that I haven't been using at all here in Raleigh...
[14:22:18] <agcolom> oh yes I did :-)
[14:22:46] <agcolom> (I noticed it thanks to the blue colour on the comments!)
[14:23:18] <agcolom> I think that's really useful/helpful... So I should do the same for mobile?
[14:23:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they're generated from a single attribute :-)
[14:23:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries/accordion.xml#L39
[14:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> Notice the example-value attribute.
[14:24:20] <agcolom> That is really clever!!!!!
[14:24:26] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to land a similar thing for method examples.
[14:24:37] <agcolom> brilliant!
[14:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commit/f8875cf8bbe86b2102ca7f217a36e7545fb6f60a
[14:24:59] <agcolom> So you've added something for that in the xslt?
[14:25:19] <agcolom> nice!!!!
[14:25:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you need to upgrade to grunt-jquery-content 0.5.8
[14:25:41] <scott_gonzalez> The method stuff hasn't been released yet.
[14:26:14] <agcolom> I upgraded to grunt-jquery-content 0.5.8 yesterday
[14:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> So you should be able to start using example-value.
[14:29:26] <agcolom> oh! Might be a task for this weekend then ;-)
[14:30:09] <agcolom> but don't I need to update the xsl file?
[14:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. It's in the base XSL that's inside grunt-jquery-content.
[14:31:41] <agcolom> ok! I was wondering was the upgrade to grunt-jquery-content 0.5.8 was doing!
[14:32:48] <agcolom> Is grunt something that is widely used?
[14:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we use it for every jQuery project.
[14:35:02] <agcolom> yes, but outside of jQuery?
[14:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> It's pretty new, but it's getting popular.
[14:35:20] <agcolom> ok, that's the feeling I was getting too...
[14:35:37] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go.
[14:35:39] <scott_gonzalez> Have a good night.
[14:36:05] <agcolom> same here! Goodnight/good evening...
[14:36:12] <agcolom> thanks!
