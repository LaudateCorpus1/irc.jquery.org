[02:38:08] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, not lost in the rewrite. But, certainly lost somewhere in template changes :(
[02:38:09] <rxaviers> will fix it

[04:32:35] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yeah, I thought I remembered it being there in the initial work you did.
[04:32:50] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer DaveMethvin|away: Let's do this.
[04:33:18] <rxaviers> reverting it was easy. But, then I realized the way check was handling dependencies was still pretty slow

[04:33:31] <rxaviers> now, I've made it a little better and usable
[04:34:16] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: "Let's do this." - the RC releases?
[04:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[04:34:30] <jzaefferer> where can I help?
[04:34:40] <jzaefferer> (brb)
[04:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> Wanna stat writing the blog post?
[04:36:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, what is happening. I was using the grunt-0-4 branch rebased on master fine yesterday.
[04:36:22] <scott_gonzalez> Now I just cherry-picked the commit onto master and grunt is failing.

[04:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> For some reason the jshint task is getting undefined for the list of files.
[04:46:27] <jzaefferer> did you npm-install again?
[04:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[04:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> So, apparently we don't lint before a release.
[04:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> We should fix that.
[04:48:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so this is failing in the grunt-0-4 branch too.
[04:48:53] <scott_gonzalez> Is this working for you?
[05:02:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, tag suggestion 1.9.2-2?

[05:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, final verdict is to use grunt 0.3 for the RC.

[05:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'll wait for jzaefferer to get back from lunch and then we'll do the release.
[05:40:46] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: so i'm going to do the blog post for core now
[05:41:59] <DaveMethvin> tuns out i have a problem with the migrate plugin still giving warnings in the minified version, seems to have started when i switched to uglify2
[05:42:11] <DaveMethvin> what happened with grunt 0.4?
[05:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ben broke all the plugins.
[05:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[05:45:26] <DaveMethvin> oh you guys probably use a lot more plugins than we do
[05:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently there was a change in how files were handled and then he re-released the contrib plugins with the same version number.
[05:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> So if one day your stuff just stops working, now you know why.
[05:45:51] <DaveMethvin> WAT!?
[05:46:03] <DaveMethvin> that's downright scary
[05:46:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, like if you were to `rm -rf node_modules; npm install`, your builds would start failing.
[05:46:16] <scott_gonzalez> So don't do that :-)
[05:46:23] <scott_gonzalez> He's hoping to have new RCs out today.
[05:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to test right after our release so that he has some more confidence.
[05:46:45] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, i may have encountered that already
[05:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> He said if you want something that works with a specific version number RIGHT NOW, use 0.3.17.
[05:47:16] <scott_gonzalez> Which is unfortunate, but fine.
[05:47:28] <scott_gonzalez> We'll just hold out another day for the RCs.
[05:47:44] <DaveMethvin> okay well i'm pulling the trigger here
[05:49:21] <jzaefferer> Nice comment on the 1.10 beta release blog post: Just upgraded development environment to this beta to try and resolve a problem with 1.9.x modal dialog ‚Äì occasional blocking of a textarea within a modal dialog. (both IE9 & Chrome)
[05:49:21] <jzaefferer> No such problem with the beta so far, so its looking very promising. Thanks guys, keep up the good work, much appreciated.

[06:26:34] <DaveMethvin> oh
[06:26:35] <DaveMethvin> ok

[06:27:07] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: can you reset my ui password?
[06:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> I can log in to blog.jquery.com, but I must not be an admin, so I can't see the installed plugins.
[06:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Just reset it.
[06:28:23] <DaveMethvin> won't let me
[06:28:36] <scott_gonzalez> I meant I just reset it :-)
[06:30:01] <DaveMethvin> yay, success
[06:30:14] <DaveMethvin> btw scott_gonzalez i made you admin on blog.jquery.com

[07:40:14] <tj_vantoll> Explicitly a the border-radius on .ui-progressbar-indeterminate .ui-progressbar-overlay seems to fix it but ugh. http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/jMydj/3/show
[07:45:33] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: ping kborchers about that ^

[07:52:24] <kborchers> tj_vantoll: hmmm, applying the border-radius doesn't really look great zoomed in either ‚Ä¶ there is a bit of a gap in the corners
[07:53:29] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, I played with the values a bit and none of them look quite right.
[08:04:24] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's certainly better with the border radius.
[08:07:37] <tj_vantoll> I don't like it but I can't come up with anything else that works.
[08:11:10] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, uhow! \o/
[08:11:32] <rxaviers> there was a bunch of changes, great to hear that

[09:06:14] <rxaviers> agcolom, after the input fields growth, when color picker is active, I think I found an issue: background box (div.hasPicker) is smaller now. 
[09:07:14] <rxaviers> changing its width to 52px seemed to fix to me. What do you think?
[09:08:56] <peol> scott_gonzalez, socialhapy has been decomissioned. he's being replaced by the spanking-new b-ot as soon as "someone" has written a github plugin for it :)
[09:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> peol: Even b-ot isn't in here right now :-P
[09:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> I was actually looking for Twitter integration when I asked.
[09:10:35] <peol> scott_gonzalez, ah. i'll set socialhapy up tonight, might get around to hack a github integration this weekend
[09:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[09:30:44] <rxaviers> ajpiano, testing the new-css in IE8 (via browserstack) the logo do not show and the left sidebar is over the main body
[09:31:07] <rxaviers> should I open an issue for each?
[09:31:31] <ajpiano> new-css is dead
[09:31:34] <ajpiano> make sure you're checking on master
[09:31:39] <ajpiano> but if so, yes, please do
[09:32:38] <rxaviers> ajpiano, Im talking about jqueryui.com actually
[09:32:40] <rxaviers> live
[09:32:51] <rxaviers> ok will open then
[09:33:00] <ajpiano> k, i'm opening ie right now
[09:35:57] <rxaviers> ajpiano, what IE base version is it supposed to support?
[09:36:44] <ajpiano> yikes
[09:36:50] <ajpiano> this definitely needs some IE love
[09:37:51] <ajpiano> i don't know if we ever made a canonical decision
[09:37:54] <ajpiano> but i think 8 is reasonable
[09:38:01] <ajpiano> i'll discuss with rworth and scott_gonzalez
[09:52:44] <ajpiano> rxaviers: i don't see what you're talkinga bot the left sidebar being over the main body
[09:54:21] <rxaviers> ajpiano, https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/967155/54160/84ab7aa0-5a85-11e2-8a14-c88d78ae6d7e.png
[09:55:12] <rxaviers> the right-border-edge of the left sidepanel is over the main body...
[09:55:19] <ajpiano> rxaviers: i'm seeing that in ie7, but not ie8
[09:58:36] <rxaviers> interesting.. might have been a broswerstack bug. It happened on ie as you can check that in my screenshot above.
[09:58:39] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I used the GitHub interface to edit the readme :-P
[09:58:40] <rxaviers> But, I could not reproduce it
[09:58:47] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't even write a commit message
[09:58:48] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: haha, sweet
[09:59:42] <rxaviers> ajpiano, what's the IE support baselevel? 8?
[09:59:56] <ajpiano> yep
[10:00:22] <rxaviers> ah wait, the bug is happening
[10:00:29] <rxaviers> on ie8, click on api doc
[10:00:53] <rxaviers> it seems after switching tabs, that bug happens
[10:00:58] <rxaviers> not on first load

[10:59:52] <tj_vantoll> I would say "patcheswelcome".  I think it's weird that the dates repeat, and if someone wants to fix that cool.  But it shouldn't cause any issues.
[11:00:25] <kborchers> +1 patcheswelcome
[11:01:36] <mikesherov> I agree with tj_vantoll 
[11:02:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, closed patcheswelcome.
[11:21:48] <agcolom> rxavier, yes, you're right.
[11:21:59] <agcolom> 52 seems ok for me too.
[11:22:02] <agcolom> Thanks!
[11:59:21] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Still around?
[12:01:53] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hi, I've changed that example... was wondering whether I could get your approval...
[12:02:40] <agcolom> http://users.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jqm/trymakeUrlAbsolute2.html
[12:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's better :-)
[12:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> You could simplify it a lot though.
[12:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> Move the relative URLs to data- attributes on the buttons.
[12:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> Remove the switch.
[12:04:16] <agcolom> ok...
[12:04:20] <agcolom> Thank you
[12:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> Also, why are you using document.getElementById() when you have jQuery?
[12:04:55] <agcolom> ok... more learning for me (I'm learning, I'm only on lesson 4 ;-) )
[12:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> heh, lesson 4 from where?
[12:06:42] <agcolom> tuts+
[12:06:52] <agcolom> It's quite good so far!
[12:07:50] <agcolom> http://learnjquery.tutsplus.com/
[12:08:01] <agcolom> you get one video each day
[12:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> interesting
[12:08:18] <agcolom> after 5 you have 1 quiz
[12:08:33] <agcolom> I'm on day 6
[12:09:07] <agcolom> So now that I'm back at work, I've put the videos on my iPod touch and I can watch while traveling
[12:09:39] <agcolom> the videos are short 8 to 18mins so far
[12:14:24] <gnarf> agcolom: why not make the value="" of the button be the url 
[12:14:28] <gnarf> skip the whole switch
[12:14:35] <gnarf> also, then the "button" shows the url
[12:14:56] <gnarf> and you can just add a "Base URL: ...." above it, and the whole example (usably) makes a lot more sense :)
[12:15:42] <agcolom> gnarf: I thought about the button value, but thought it might be too long and not look very nice...
[12:16:34] <agcolom> although yes it's not that long... 
[12:16:46] <agcolom> I was trying to get all buttons on 1 line
[12:35:47] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: gnarf http://users.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jqm/trymakeUrlAbsolute2.html
[12:36:25] <agcolom> and OMG this is so much shorter!
[12:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> much better :-)
[12:37:43] <scott_gonzalez> Now, just drop the "div" from "div#myResult" since the id on its own is the enough and the fastest.
[12:37:58] <scott_gonzalez> s/the enough/enough/
[12:39:18] <agcolom> ok, done :-) thank you so much!!!!
[12:39:42] <scott_gonzalez> You're welcome.
[12:39:48] <agcolom> Then I have a few methods for which I can now create a proper example ;-)
[12:39:53] <agcolom> I am very happy :-)
[12:40:42] <agcolom> do you know if github is ok now or still playing up?
[12:46:40] <scott_gonzalez> They're back to normal: https://status.github.com/messages
[12:48:20] <agcolom> perfect! thank you
[13:03:29] <gnarf> agcolom: one last suggestion the //foo.com link could be //notfoo.com to further drive home the point :)
[13:09:55] <agcolom> gnarf: I'm not a fan of the foo / bar examples.... I just stick to those for now as they're in the current docs... 
[13:34:48] <gnarf> i just meant that the //foo.com link is kinda strange, because they are all already //foo.com ya know?
[13:35:02] <gnarf> so it doesn't show that its actually changing the domain of the request TO foo.com (because it was)
[14:17:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: here for a little while
[20:18:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you aren't around this late are you?
