[06:45:21] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, did you know that outerWidth actually works as a setter?
[06:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> in UI it does
[06:46:01] <jzaefferer> oh
[06:46:07] <jzaefferer> that's the trick m(
[06:46:10] <scott_gonzalez> heh, yup
[06:46:18] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[06:46:21] <scott_gonzalez> I knew about that....cuz I wrote it :-)
[06:47:19] <jzaefferer> also, any idea how to use tooltip to display form validation messages? showing it on focus if a field is invalid, not showing it if it is valid, preferably reacting to on-the-fly validation
[06:48:13] <scott_gonzalez> do you get on-the-fly events from the validation?
[06:48:35] <jzaefferer> kind of
[06:48:46] <jzaefferer> currently trying to use showErrors, which gets called all the time
[06:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> if you're using a delegated tooltip, then you'll probably need to create a fake event
[06:50:40] <jzaefferer> tried this:
[06:50:42] <jzaefferer> $(this.currentForm).tooltip("close", { currentTarget: focussed }, true).tooltip("open", { currentTarget: focussed });
[06:50:55] <jzaefferer> that just causes it to close way too often
[06:51:41] <jzaefferer> at least I figured out why the on-key-up validation didn't work with newer jQuery versions: [type=text] doesn't match if the input has no type attribute :/
[06:53:05] <scott_gonzalez> there should be property matching
[06:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> that'd fix [type=text]
[07:06:03] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/39b9432b5f94e61f5d33
[07:06:11] <jzaefferer> (look, I didn't paste the code here!)
[07:07:07] <jzaefferer> that's actually working, but flashes the tooltip while you're typing in an still invalid field (like email)
[07:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, you'll want a conditional around the closing
[07:08:15] <scott_gonzalez> if focussed in list
[07:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> you might be able to use .is() for that or maybe .index()
[07:14:26] <jzaefferer> focussed in list?
[07:14:47] <jzaefferer> I need to close and reopen whenever the title changes
[07:14:56] <jzaefferer> but do not touch if it stays the same...
[07:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> if the tooltip is already open for an invalid field, you don't want to close it
[07:19:47] <jzaefferer> right, but I may want to update the message
[07:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> if the problem is that you can't change the content without re-opening, then we should consider if that's something we want to support
[07:19:50] <jzaefferer> so refresh it
[07:20:09] <jzaefferer> would be useful here
[07:20:24] <jzaefferer> tried turning of animations to hide the issue, but can't figure out how to do that :/
[07:21:02] <jzaefferer> there is no wiki.jqueryui.com/Widget
[07:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> you can actually hold on to the response callback from the content option
[07:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> and you can update a tooltip as much as you want with it :-P
[07:21:20] <jzaefferer> uh?
[07:21:56] <scott_gonzalez> the content option supports async responses
[07:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> you can invoke the response callback as many times as you want
[07:22:08] <opie_> that's a good idea just keep calling response
[07:23:03] <opie_> i love that content code in tooltip, because i can return my "loading" markup and then the deffered sets the conetnt when the call returns. it works great
[07:23:29] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:23:57] <opie_> is $.ui.popup used by any of the other controls?
[07:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: expect a message about TestSwarm from WikiMedia
[07:24:25] <opie_> or is that old, seems like it would be nice to have a base contorl that does specifically that content pattern from $.ui.tooltip
[07:24:59] <opie_> i ended up rolling my own since tooltip isn't easily extensible since it does so much but i couldn't find that content patter anywhere else in the library/
[07:25:15] <jzaefferer> wikimedia?
[07:25:18] <jzaefferer> mediawiki?
[07:25:21] <jzaefferer> krinkle?
[07:26:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: getting access to that from the showErrors code isn't trivial
[07:26:26] <jzaefferer> don't see a way to do that right now
[07:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> WikiMedia is the foundation that owns MediaWiki
[07:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.wikimedia.org/
[07:26:36] <jzaefferer> at least I managed to disable animations, that hides the issue for now
[07:27:57] <jzaefferer> lookie there: http://jzaefferer.github.com/jquery-validation/demo/themerollered.html
[07:28:00] <opie_> jzaefferer: did you just set options.show and options.hide to false?
[07:29:27] <opie_> ohh nice, yeah works really well
[07:30:09] <jzaefferer> opie_: yep
[07:32:32] <opie_> funky checkbox behavior, that is a really nice example of tooltip though
[09:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: think you can look this over before tomorrow's meeting? https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/pull/5
[09:12:55] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (4d, 12h ago): Droppable review
[09:44:16] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: yeah, but as usual, why isn't that against https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/interactions ?
[09:44:51] <scott_gonzalez> because he's still working against his fork, which he shouldn't be
[09:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> so I had to do the review against his fork
[09:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> I could've merged it in before doing the review
[09:47:11] <scott_gonzalez> could be related to the fact that he doesn't have commit access...
[09:47:38] <jzaefferer> oh yeah?
[09:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just give him commit access and tell him to start pushing to the main repo
[09:47:44] <jzaefferer> well, if thats the issue, let's fix that
[09:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> oh, he does
[09:47:49] <jzaefferer> k, thanks
[09:47:52] <jzaefferer> eh?
[09:47:55] <scott_gonzalez> stupid sort order
[09:48:07] <jzaefferer> sorted by least awesome?
[09:48:13] <scott_gonzalez> it's really annoying that GitHub sorts by capitalization
[09:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> Z comes before a
[09:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> so DaveStein is above danheberden
[09:48:48] <scott_gonzalez> and so is RedWolves
[09:49:35] <jzaefferer> yeah, that stinks
[09:50:12] <jzaefferer> specs on wiki for draggable and droppable are up to date?
[09:50:18] <jzaefferer> that is, match what you do there?
[09:51:37] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez ^^^
[09:52:01] <jzaefferer> well, doesn't look like it
[09:52:18] <scott_gonzalez> draggable is
[09:58:29] <jzaefferer> so, where is our new droppable spec?
[09:58:35] <jzaefferer> same place as datepicker?
[10:04:16] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'm done with my review. Added a few comments. Also added TODOs on Draggable page for spec updates.
[10:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> yes, we're just starting with the bare minimum right now
