[00:42:45] <Dahliz91> In the stop event on my sortable I am updating my column with row numbers. But the elements that has been moved doesn't update even do I can se the new value when i send the element to console after updating the value. Is sortable replacing the element with a new one when it moved the element?
[00:45:06] <_|Nix|_> Dahliz91: That's a question best suited for #jquery
[00:47:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: although controlgroup option type is a style option I think we should leave that one, because you have to call refresh for the first/last classes
[00:47:48] <Dahliz91> _|Nix|_: yes
[00:48:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ... and controlgroup refresh has to call checkboxradio refresh in case you use it with that widget
[00:54:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, actually, it's not for the first/last classes, because those remain the same. You have to call it for the checkboxes.
[00:54:58] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[00:55:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, would it be possible to turn the icon on/off from CSS depending on whether the parent element has a class set or not?
[00:56:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah of course... the border-radius settings changes, not the first/last classes

[01:03:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, because we have to add the active button class
[01:04:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, the behaviour is different, eh?
[01:04:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[01:04:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and it would be a violation of theme semantics to define the style when a horizontally grouped checkbox is active to be the same as the active button style, right?

[07:28:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Still around? Got the one about preventing default upon pressing Enter up for review: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7243
[07:29:00] <arschmitz> yup
[07:29:15] <arschmitz> im pretty much always here after 8eastern lol
[07:29:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[07:30:18] <arschmitz> well i normally take a break for lunch lol but other then that
[07:31:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what have you tested this on for browsers?
[07:33:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just Chrome, IINM.
[07:34:01] <arschmitz> ok give me some time to test on some phones then
[07:34:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Thanks!
[07:38:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll also browserstack it some ...
[07:49:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Checking physical devices instead - BS is too slow for me right now.
[07:49:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: On iOS 6.1 it prevents default, alright, but the on-screen keyboard remains up.
[07:50:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah that goes away on blur
[07:50:29] <arschmitz> my devices are charging iv been moving my office around so most were unplugged 
[07:51:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. So are mine ... I have an iPod for testing iOS, so that thing retains a charge for incredibly long - not so those that are actually phones.
[07:51:21] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:51:32] <arschmitz> this event debugger is cool!
[07:51:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you extend it to actual native events?
[07:52:16] <arschmitz> not directly 
[07:52:22] <arschmitz> it gets all its info from the api docs
[07:52:35] <_|Nix|_> Right, I forgot ... sorry ...
[07:52:38] <arschmitz> because it provides descriptions of the events and stuff
[08:03:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: On Andrdoid 2.3.5 it closes the virtual KB.
[08:04:10] <arschmitz> yeah ios only closes on blur i think
[08:04:34] <_|Nix|_> Booting WP8 Real Soon Nowâ„¢
[08:09:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: On WP8 the input retains focus and the keyboard disappears, and if you click on the input again, it doesn't open the keyboard again ... until thirty seconds pass, after which it finally decides "hey, the guy clicked the input - maybe I should open the VK again" :/
[08:10:12] <arschmitz> :/
[08:10:16] <_|Nix|_> The more disturbing phenomenon on WP8 is that the filter doesn't seem to be working.
[08:10:30] <arschmitz> well thats probably the root of the other issue
[08:10:32] <_|Nix|_> I type "a", and "BMW" doesn't disappear.
[08:11:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You mean, I should type "a" and then wait thirty seconds?
[08:11:57] <arschmitz> no i mean if we fix filterable in the first place it might fix the keyboard issue
[08:12:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I could blur the input when I prevent the default ...
[08:12:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is that what you mean?
[08:13:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you said filterable is not working on wp8 right
[08:13:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's right. Oh, I see what you mean.
[08:15:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: K, well, in a page on its own it works just fine. It just doesn't work in the demos :/
[08:16:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird ...
[08:16:33] <arschmitz> might be something with the extension in the demos
[08:16:40] <_|Nix|_> Might be.
[08:16:52] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, the preventDefault() doesn't seem to be working.
[08:17:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: check to see if its a different keycode
[08:18:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Will do.
[08:19:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's ENTER>
[08:19:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe I also need to stop propagation or something :(
[08:20:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's bad though ...
[08:20:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can document this so that ppl are aware that they need to prevent submission by other means.
[08:27:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: One (risky?) thing we can do is $( this.element[ 0 ].form ).one( "submit", function( event ) { event.preventDefault(); });
[08:28:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course, I'd be more careful about how I establish what the form is. The above just illustrates the basic process I'm thinking about.
[08:31:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, according to wikipedia WP only has 3.6% market share - so, do we really care?
[08:31:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone#By_operating_system
[08:33:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats still the thrid biggest phone
[08:33:26] <arschmitz> i mean if we say we dont care about windows phone then all we care about is android and ios
[08:33:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, well, then what do you think about my risky(?) proposal?
[08:34:11] <arschmitz> im not sure id need to look into more if there is some other way we can prevent it
[08:34:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about landing this and then opening a second bug that's Platform: Windows Phone?
[08:35:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: After all, it works on both Android and iOS.
[08:35:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but the widget is unresponsive on wp for 30seconds after?
[08:35:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Only in the demos.
[08:36:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It might actually be that it's reloading the page via Ajax because of the submit, now that I think about it.
[08:36:26] <arschmitz> can you check?
[08:36:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[08:38:33] <_|Nix|_> Yep, that's it.
[08:39:51] <_|Nix|_> OK, so the only problem is that, on WP8, preventing default on $.ui.keyCode.ENTER does not prevent the submit.
[08:43:29] <arschmitz> ok thats ok then
[08:44:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Another, probably unrelated problem ... on WP7.5, I don't think backspace triggers a change.
[08:44:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or any other event we respond to ...
[08:45:03] <arschmitz> fun
[08:45:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I type "a", and it filters appropriately. I type backspace, and the same entries remain on screen.
[08:45:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, there's nothing we can do if we don't get the message.
[08:45:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... unless we poll the contents of the input. Shoot. Me. Now.
[08:46:10] <_|Nix|_> Fineprint: I don't literally want you to launch a small mass of metal at supersonic speed in my direction.
[08:47:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so I gave it a rest while I typed these things, and now I pick up the same phone and it works just fine.
[08:47:42] <arschmitz> ha
[08:47:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wonder how much M$ pays for bananas.
[08:49:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! It's anyone's guess whether the next backspace will achieve the desired effect.
[08:50:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D9vAItORgE
[08:51:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The good news is, WP8 seems solid wrt. backspace.
[08:57:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: On WP7.5 eating the event entirely with .stopPropagation(), .stopImmediatePropagation(), and return false will work. But not on WP8.
[09:07:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/9531316
[09:07:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Works on all my phones.
[09:07:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's the risky way of doing it.
[09:08:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: _onKeyDown is an extension point. We might do things the Right Wayâ„¢ and let people override if they need to.
[09:27:09] <frequent> _Nix_: hey
[09:27:29] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hey (i mean)
[09:28:09] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I was just reading up. I did a PR for e.preventDefault() on filterable - #7154
[09:38:19] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Oh, right ... I'm such an idiot. I have it in my open tabs, and I check up on it from time to time, and yet ... swoosh ... forgot right about it ...
[09:39:07] <frequent> _|Nix|_: np. tabocalypse here, too...
[09:39:23] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Wait, no. That's a different thing.
[09:39:36] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Your PR intends to prevent the filtering from happening.
[09:39:48] <_|Nix|_> frequent: My PR intends to prevent the form submission from happening.
[09:39:49] <frequent> _|Nix|_: yes. on filterablebeforefilter exit
[09:40:07] <_|Nix|_> frequent: When you hit ENTER in an input it submits the form. That's bad.
[09:40:11] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok
[09:40:16] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Two different things.
[09:40:34] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... and right now we're trying to figure out how to make it work on all browsers.
[09:40:49] <frequent> _|Nix|_: +1 for blocking the form submit. I'm fighting with this, too.
[09:41:05] <_|Nix|_> frequent: There's no good way of doing it.
[09:41:23] <frequent> _|Nix|_: there is. Don't wrap in a form ;-)
[09:41:50] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Well, what if it is wrapped in a form. We accept an input from the dev, remember?
[09:41:51] <frequent> _|Nix|_: but also not a option for me...
[09:42:31] <_|Nix|_> frequent: If you're dealing with an input, you /have/ to deal with submission.
[09:42:45] <frequent> _|Nix|_: let me check real quick what I'm doing in my current code.
[09:43:22] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Right now, preventing default on keydown works just fine, except on WP.
[09:44:01] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... and I'm not sure how reliable it is to do this: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/9531316
[09:44:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: WB!
[09:44:11] <frequent> _|Nix|_: WP I can't check, just want to see what I'm doing, because my form isn't submitting. I had key submit issues a while ago.
[09:44:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thank you :)
[09:44:42] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah, for sure, if you're doing something other than preventing default on keydown, then I'm all ears/eyes/whatever.
[09:45:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7240?
[09:45:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: didn't arschmitz look at what UI does?
[09:46:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We have https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7243 (which doesn't work on WP), and we have https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/9531316 which is what I can use instead, but I'm not sure I'd want to.
[09:46:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: UI does https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7243
[09:48:31] <_|Nix|_> Oh, wait a second ... UI does more. It also binds to keypress.
[09:48:39] <_|Nix|_> Lessee about that.
[09:48:43] <_|Nix|_> That may fix this.

[11:12:38] <arschmitz> so my original idea i started over a year ago :( for this was to make a set of pages that when you navigated between them it would log / alert the events as they took place
[11:12:59] <arschmitz> so you could see the order in which they happened and if you used alerts it pauses execution 
[11:13:06] <arschmitz> so you can see the current state of the page
[11:14:00] <arschmitz> while i was working on this it became clear more info was needed besides just the name that the event data and ui object would be nice to be able to be seen
[11:14:18] <arschmitz> then i thought wow a description of the event would be great too
[11:15:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you are typing in the wrong channel :)

[12:04:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you cant close the select
[12:04:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I have no idea
[12:05:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the select menu gets stuck open with no way out
[12:05:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Must be a BS artefact that it doesn't on BS.
[12:05:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: are you testing in chrome on BS i didnt think it was an option

[12:06:28] <_|Nix|_> OK.

[12:06:44] <arschmitz> and thats where im seeing it
[12:07:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: when you open a native select on chrome ios7 there are 3 buttons up down and close and the typical scrolling thing
[12:07:36] <uGoMobi> oh I thought the OP was talking about a close button that we generated
[12:07:40] <arschmitz> the close button does not work so your stuck in the select forever
[12:07:59] <uGoMobi> hmm
[12:08:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wonder if this can be reproduced without jQM - i.e., not our fault.
[12:08:18] <arschmitz> actually none of the buttons work

[12:08:54] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/061.4-stable 14c017357 15Ghislain Seguin: Build: Set branch to 1.4-stable for TravisCI
[12:09:04] <arschmitz> even if it is a bug in chrome we are triggering it somehow
[12:09:29] <gseguin> alright waiting to hear back from Travis on no-prefix-try2 and then ready to rock 'n roll
[12:09:39] <uGoMobi> yihaaa
[12:10:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you run Chrome on iOS7 on BS?
[12:10:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you dont
[12:10:33] <_|Nix|_> Dang!
[12:10:40] <_|Nix|_> So, I can't repro it, after all :/
[12:11:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you have test devices, right?
[12:11:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I only have an iPod with iOS 6.1.
[12:16:12] <_|Nix|_> ... and I can't repro it :(
[12:30:22] <cgack> I tried that chrome bug on iOS7.1/Chrome33 and could not reproduce fwiw
[12:31:11] <arschmitz> cgack: hmm i have same and it happens every time :|
[12:31:25] <cgack> iPhone 4 for me if that matters
[12:31:37] <arschmitz> might 5s here
[12:31:48] <arschmitz> i have a 4 though so i can check that

[12:34:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ping!
[12:38:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[12:38:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: at some point we completely broke the order of events in navigation
[12:39:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, we do absorb and re-trigger popstate at some point.
[12:39:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no i mean like the page events
[12:39:38] <_|Nix|_> Oh, those.
[12:39:45] <arschmitz> pagechange is no longer the last event like we promise it is
[12:40:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What follows it?
[12:40:31] <arschmitz> pagecontainertransition
[12:40:51] <_|Nix|_> Right, but wait ... pagechange is supposed to be gone, right?
[12:41:09] <arschmitz> and i clicked in some sequence where show and hide were after it too
[12:41:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nope we never replaced it :| or deprecated it 
[12:41:35] <arschmitz> its the same for many of the page events
[12:41:41] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ...
[12:41:55] <arschmitz> i get the distinct impression the pagecontainer was not as done as we had been lead to believe
[12:41:59] <_|Nix|_> Or, as Linus Torvalds once said "Disquieting..."
[12:42:20] <_|Nix|_> I was getting the same impression on and off.
[12:42:58] <_|Nix|_> I'm not sure what is to be the fate of non-pagecontainer* events.
[12:43:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they need to be deprecated and replaced
[12:43:26] <_|Nix|_> We still have pagebeforechange and pagechange ...
[12:43:40] <arschmitz> and several other pageremove is one
[12:44:06] <_|Nix|_> I know that pagebeforechange with a jQuery Object is to be replaced with pagecontainerbeforetransition.
[12:44:13] <_|Nix|_> ... which makes sense.
[12:44:17] <arschmitz> right
[12:44:24] <_|Nix|_> ... and I think we can actually drop that.
[12:44:43] <arschmitz> it should be pagecontainerbeforechange too
[12:44:49] <arschmitz> to replace pagebeforechange
[12:44:53] <_|Nix|_> Oh, no - we can't. We didn't document that it was deprecated.
[12:45:19] <_|Nix|_> Man ... what a mess ...
[12:45:20] <arschmitz> right
[12:45:28] <arschmitz> thats what i mean we need to do it for 1.5
[12:45:46] <jqcommit> [13jquery-color] 15CarlFK opened issue #64: no online demo 02http://git.io/Mue91A
[12:46:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We should probably save any more detailed discussion until after we have gotten rid of all the code we've deprecated in 1.4.
[12:46:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also the deprecated attribute is missing here http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagebeforeshow/
[12:46:52] <arschmitz> and here http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageshow/
[12:47:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, but we have the warning div, so it's legit to add the flag now.
[12:47:35] <arschmitz> yeah just need to add the attribute
[12:47:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll make an issue/PR.
[12:47:53] <arschmitz> noticed because the debugger looks for it

[13:58:50] <sarora> Hi, wondering if anyone can help with the following question:
[13:59:07] <sarora> i'm trying to use the jQuery UI tabs control
[13:59:36] <sarora> but it doesn't seem to work for me, and looking at one working demo i see it references various scripts like jquery.ui.tabs.js
[13:59:48] <gseguin> sarora: This is the developer channel, for support please use #jquery
[14:00:20] <sarora> ok, sorry and thanks
[14:00:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you think about my changes to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7243? It's fixed the submit prevention on all my devices, including the WP ones.
[14:01:22] <arschmitz> ill look in just a sec trying to figure something out
[14:01:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NP, and thanks!
