[00:31:35] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery UI Release Coverage build #23: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20Release%20Coverage/23/
[00:31:36] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Initial implementation for generating manifest files.
[00:31:36] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Minor manifest updates.
[00:31:37] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Accidentally removed licenses.
[00:31:37] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Let's not pretend that manifest names are configurable...
[00:31:38] <i-hate-dave> * kswedberg: Update descriptions of UI components in manifest files.
[00:31:38] <i-hate-dave> * joern.zaefferer: Manifest: Add category field
[00:31:39] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Manifests: Fixed typo.
[00:31:39] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Manifest: Use existing data structure to infer categorization.
[00:31:40] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Manifest: Move interactions to their own file.
[00:31:40] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Spinner: Trivial spelling fix in demo.
[00:31:41] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Sortable: Reset fromOutside property when canceling helper removal. Fixes #8430 - draggable with sortable makes sortable event receive triggered wrong.

[00:31:42] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Manifest: Move transfer effect to core.json since it's not like other effects (no show/hide).

[08:47:46] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: is there supposed to be any output from manager.js
[08:47:50] <ajpiano> when a plugin is successfully added?
[08:47:59] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[08:48:07] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, there is, but it's in syslog.
[08:48:46] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: If you want to see output, you can run the scripts individually and pass a flag.
[08:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> node scripts/update-server.js --console
[08:48:57] <scott_gonzalez> node scripts/wordpress-update --console
[08:54:03] <ajpiano> boom
[08:55:22] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: 2 questions.
[08:55:32] <ajpiano> 1) what task should i run if i just want to deploy the docs
[08:56:00] <scott_gonzalez> grunt docs
[08:56:18] <ajpiano> ah
[08:56:50] <ajpiano> 2)  the plugins appear in the posts table in the DB, but i can't seem to navigate to them
[08:57:09] <scott_gonzalez> So that might be a two part thing.
[08:57:23] <scott_gonzalez> First, log in and go to the permalinks admin page.
[08:57:54] <scott_gonzalez> That will fix a bug in the install script which doesn't properly set permalinks: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/44
[08:57:55] <ajpiano> ok
[08:57:56] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #44 on web-base-template (rdworth; 1w, 3d ago): New sites show as 404 until the wp-admin permalinks is visited
[08:58:01] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need to change anything, just go to the page and it'll be fixed.
[08:58:09] <ajpiano> oh wow
[08:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> The second part is that the index page doesn't show plugins yet.
[08:58:26] <scott_gonzalez> But the search page does.
[08:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> So you can search for "foo" and you should see it.
[08:58:49] <ajpiano> yeah, that is some dark juju that you just have to hit the permalinks page
[08:58:50] <scott_gonzalez> You can also navigate directly to the plugin, e.g., http://dev.plugins.jquery.com/foo
[08:58:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[08:59:11] <ajpiano> hm, i actually do have an index page that shows "new plugins" and "recent updates"
[08:59:12] <ajpiano> so yay
[08:59:14] <ajpiano> ok great
[08:59:36] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: thoughts on me doing the docs in markdown than html?
[09:00:18] <ajpiano> rather*
[09:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the index page will list all docs pages right now.
[09:01:28] <kswedberg> ajpiano: I just added the "new plugins" and "recent updates"  :)
[09:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: If you want to write the conversion in the grunt task, go ahead.
[09:01:58] <ajpiano> kswedberg: oh wow like, *just*
[09:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> I like the simplicity of having HTML though.
[09:02:22] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: the task i've been working on for learn just handles it, i have it as a separate grunt-whatever plugin
[09:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> There's no build process, no dist directory, etc.
[09:02:49] <ajpiano> i hear ya
[09:56:50] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I'm getting https://gist.github.com/3130581 when `grunt setup` in plugins.jquery.com
[09:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Run `grunt clean-all setup` since you have existing data.
[09:58:12] <rworth> scott_gonzalez thanks, tried that. same result
[10:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> Add a console.log( error ) to the task and see what the error is.
[10:04:31] <rworth> { [Error: SQLITE_ERROR: table actions already exists] errno: 1, code: 'SQLITE_ERROR' }
[10:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> The clean-all task should kill that.
[10:10:57] <scott_gonzalez> Are you sure you ran clean-all and not just clean?
[10:13:47] <rworth> I did indeed
[10:13:55] <rworth> can I just delete the db?
[10:14:51] <rworth> oh, my bad - I ran `grunt setup` again after `grunt clean-all setup` (didn't look closely enough to see i was running setup twice in two sep. calls)
[10:14:54] <rworth> all good. thanks
[10:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[11:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: What is this testing? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/menu/menu_events.js#L580
[11:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> How would someone press keys on an element that isn't focused?
[11:04:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that looks like it can probably be removed. i think that's from before focus handling was cleaned up
[11:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:05:43] <scott_gonzalez> And now menu tests consistently pass in IE9 :-)
[11:05:48] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: the name is misleading. there was a time where the menu would have focus but no element would have have the ui-state-focus class yet and this was testing that pageup and pagedown would bring focus to that first element
[11:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, ok.
[11:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> Well that's not what the actual test was doing :-P
[11:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> It was making sure that the element itself did not have focus.
[11:06:36] <kborchers> doh
[11:06:48] * kborchers finds a new job
[11:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> IE was having this weird problem where document.activeElement was becoming null.
[11:07:29] <scott_gonzalez> And things were blowing up.
[11:08:10] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: caused by this test??? or something else you found?

[11:08:43] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu tests: Removed test for key handling when the element doens't have focus (illogical test). - Scott González
[11:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> I think it was caused by the test before it.
[11:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> But I couldn't confirm.
[11:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> The test was the only place I could see the problem.
[11:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> But running the test by itself it would always pass.
[11:09:14] <kborchers> hmmmm
