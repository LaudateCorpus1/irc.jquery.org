[07:35:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[07:36:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7169 ... we need to pull a new tabs widget.
[07:37:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That can probably happen no sooner than 1.5.0.

[09:38:51] <agcolom> arschmitz: are you still around?
[09:41:19] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: gseguin: uGoMobi: We have the wrong short description for throttledresize... 
[09:41:25] <agcolom> how about: prevents browsers from running continuous callbacks on resize?
[09:41:32] <agcolom> http://api.jquerymobile.com/throttledresize/
[09:42:06] <gseguin> agcolom: that sounds fine
[09:42:09] <agcolom> currently it seems that the short description for hashchange was copied over...
[09:42:15] <agcolom> gseguin: Thanks!
[09:42:18] <agcolom> Will fix that now.
[09:43:59] <gseguin> agcolom: from http://underscorejs.org/#throttle : "when invoked repeatedly, will only actually call the original function at most once per every wait milliseconds. Useful for rate-limiting events that occur faster than you can keep up with."
[09:46:01] <agcolom> Word has taken over my computer! 
[09:49:21] <agcolom> gseguin: my other proposal was "Limits the rate of the execution of handlers on resize events. "
[09:49:40] <gseguin> agcolom: that works too
[09:50:20] <agcolom> if you had to vote? (1 or 2)?
[09:50:35] <agcolom> a mix of both?
[09:50:52] <gseguin> 2
[09:51:04] <agcolom> ok, going with option 2.
[09:51:06] <agcolom> Thanks

[10:46:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[10:52:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that tabs issue is a bug in mobile
[11:19:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Really? How so?
[11:21:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well think about it the only way the two .hrefs cant match is if we are manipulating one
[11:21:27] <arschmitz> push state changes both
[11:21:45] <arschmitz> and we are changing the href on the link by updating the base
[11:22:13] <arschmitz> we update the base initalize the page then pushstate
[11:22:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, I figured it was something like that, but I didn't want to change the order in which we do these things, because we probably do it that way for a good reason.
[11:23:16] <arschmitz> there is a reason but it does not really make sense
[11:23:33] <arschmitz> its so that when we pull resources we get the right base
[11:23:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I guess we could update the base after enhancing the page?
[11:23:49] <arschmitz> nope
[11:23:59] <arschmitz> you will try and pull all the wrong images and stuff
[11:24:16] <arschmitz> we need to update the url and the base at the same time
[11:27:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But then how do we avoid this situation?
[11:27:57] <arschmitz> well we have 2 choices
[11:28:50] <arschmitz> we can say let logic dictate things here and just switch to update the url sooner and say hey the navigation worked it was the transition that failed therefore the url is technically correct
[11:29:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: or if the transition fails we can nav back to the from page
[11:37:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, if we succeed in loading the page, then there's no reason the transition should fail.
[11:38:19] <arschmitz> agreed its a super edge case
[11:38:23] <arschmitz> but thats the logic
[11:38:46] <arschmitz> for why it is the way it is now
[11:39:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: though i think i am in favor of changing the logic to that and just test well for possible transition failures
[11:40:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: though honestly the only transition fails iv seen result in a blank white page lol
[11:40:52] <arschmitz> at which point its probably better if when they refresh it goes  to the new page not the old one
[11:41:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there is also a simple work around
[11:41:59] <arschmitz> for now
[11:42:08] <arschmitz> use absolute urls in the tabs links
[11:45:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do we do this for 1.4.x, or for 1.5.0?
[11:47:28] <arschmitz> i think navigation order is too big a change for 1.4
[11:52:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have a couple prs that need a review if you have time
[11:55:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sure, hit me.
[11:55:29] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pulls/arschmitz
[12:03:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The linkbar is very nice!
[12:03:52] <arschmitz> yeah i made some minor changes from the old one to make it smoother
[12:04:05] <arschmitz> too bad on ios it only adjusts once you stop scrolling
[12:04:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We had something similar in web-ui-fw: http://web-ui-fw.github.io/#shortcutscroll-demo
[12:05:31] <arschmitz> cool
[12:05:41] <arschmitz> it was agcoloms idea she asked me to make it
[12:10:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7004/files#diff-6d15a611c0df883200a38818496539a6R48
[12:11:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ??
[12:13:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry, just checking before I say anything dumb :)
[12:13:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, if the code there gets run from the page's _create() then the .data( "mobile-page" ) is not yet assigned to the element.
[12:14:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, you should really be checking ":jqmData(role='page'),:data(mobilePage)" ...
[12:15:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Although, if you did $( "<div><div data-role='panel'><p>Blah</p></div></div>" ).page(), I have no idea how you would catch the parent page.
[12:16:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that what :data(mobilepage) does
[12:17:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: wait no if data is not set until after create
[12:17:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[12:17:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's what I'm saying.
[12:17:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In fact, there's no way to tell that the parent is going to be turned into a page, if the data-role is not set.
[12:19:32] <arschmitz> oh wait yes there is
[12:19:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Really? How?
[12:19:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the classes are assigned before enhancewithin()
[12:20:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so, for pages, the best way is to .closest( ".ui-page" ) ...
[12:20:18] <arschmitz> so ui-page will always be there if the page widget has been initalized
[12:20:20] <_|Nix|_> Good to know.
[12:20:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So then you should change that to .closest( ".ui-page" )
[12:21:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In fact, we should make the same change everywhere, for consistency.
[12:21:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im thinking ui or or data role page
[12:21:26] <arschmitz> just incase someone trys to call them selves
[12:21:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Add the selectors in order of speed.
[12:21:46] <agcolom> oh, yes, that demo was like magic. I had the idea on the train while going through some songs on my iPod Touch. I thought we could do something similar. I described it to arschmitz and a few hours later, arschmitz had built it! I think that was about one year ago, because I showed it in Vienna.
[12:21:47] <arschmitz> like they do .panel() on something before the page has had a chance
[12:22:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it wont catch all cases but it will catch some
[12:22:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure, I think ".ui-page,:jqmData(role='page'),:data(mobilePage)" should be the order.
[12:23:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That should cover basic usage quickly and efficiently.
[12:23:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i cant think of any situation data(mobilePage) will catch the first 2 wont
[12:23:34] <arschmitz> specificly that .ui-page wont
[12:23:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's true.
[12:24:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Basically, :data(mobilePage) === .ui-page
[12:24:13] <arschmitz> yeah in this case
[12:25:02] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah i remember it was something like that
[12:25:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see you also got rid of that weird _wrapper/_getWrapper indirection ... that's good.
[12:26:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah and change when its update
[12:26:19] <arschmitz> it fixes all those weird iframe reload issues
[12:27:15] <arschmitz> i tracked them all down to use detaching dom elements to wrap them
[12:27:36] <arschmitz> when you re-attach it it reloads the i frame
[12:28:28] <arschmitz> which is bad for dynamicly generated ones because you end up with a totally blank iframe
[12:28:42] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's totally cool.
[12:31:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: PRs're looking good. Just some extra blank lines in the panel one is all.
[12:31:22] <arschmitz> cool thanks
[12:38:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Another thought about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7169: If changing the base is turned off, and so is pushState, that will still break, right?
[12:41:33] <arschmitz> no
[12:41:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nah, I guess then it would work, because both the location.href and the base would keep pointing at the opening URL throughout the lifetime of the app.
[12:41:37] <arschmitz> the tabs would be fine
[12:41:53] <arschmitz> it would break things like fetching images
[12:42:04] <arschmitz> but tabs would be fine
[12:42:21] <_|Nix|_> *nod*
[12:45:29] <jqcommit> [13demos.jquerymobile.com] 15bbilbeau opened issue #7: Typo in http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.1/icons/#Removingthedisc 02http://git.io/hSAtSw
[12:57:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I still can't help but think that it would do us some good to grab a later version of the tabs widget and override _isLocal(). The fact that it consults location.href is a major assumption on how navigation is done. If a navigation framework is in place, then location.href may or may not be the best comparison partner for an anchor's href.
[12:58:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: basicly the only thing it assumes is that you dont manipulate the base
[12:58:11] <arschmitz> which ui does not support
[12:58:40] <arschmitz> i dont think it makes sense for us to change the base at a different time then the url
[12:59:05] <arschmitz> which actually infact makes it so we dont need the base unless im mistaken?
[12:59:50] <_|Nix|_> That sounds right - unless there are bugs with some pushState implementations.
[13:00:17] <_|Nix|_> ... things like whether the hash change takes place synchronously or not.
[13:02:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we are also removing the the combining of hash and push state
[13:02:49] <arschmitz> we had talked about this for 1.4 but are not doing it until 1.5 of course now
[13:03:02] <arschmitz> it only like that to support ios4 and push state
[13:12:27] <agcolom> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: gseguin: anyone of you around?

[13:13:56] <uGoMobi> we changed the class name in 1.4
[13:13:56] <agcolom> good :-)
