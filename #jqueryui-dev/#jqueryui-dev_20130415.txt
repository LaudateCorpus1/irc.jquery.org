[04:46:25] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, hello
[04:46:25] <b-ot> rxaviers: You have 1 new message (and 1 unread), use `read when you wish to read it.
[04:47:53] <rxaviers> Yeap, it doens't seem that popup bug affects menubar. By the way, I need to get in sync with current development of such widgets. But, as I remember in the past menubar use to have popup as a dep before. It seems it doesnt anymore.
[04:48:01] <rxaviers> read
[04:48:10] <rxaviers> b-ot, read
[04:51:45] <rxaviers> b-ot: read
[04:51:57] <rxaviers> arg
[04:57:51] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, it seemed to me a good aproach to separate both logics. I was using popup in a project of mine to implement a popover like that http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#popovers
[04:58:16] <rxaviers> are you guys planning to kill it?
[05:22:35] <church_> hey, anyone know how to center an element on a shake effect. The element is centered but onclick it shoots off to the left . I have tried with .css() in the function but it is not working
[05:27:20] <church_> nevermind .. just created a wrapper over the element
[05:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> church_: CAn you create a jsFiddle or jsbin with an example of what wasn't working?
[05:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> It might be a bug inside jQuery UI.
[05:49:02] <church_> scott_gonzalez: no its fine now, i created a wrapper around the element that i wanted to effect which kept it centered. should this question have been asked in the #jquery channel. Not sure if this is just for core juery ui development questions
[05:49:55] <jzaefferer> oh hi
[05:50:01] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: popup is NOT on the roadmap
[05:50:23] <jzaefferer> the wiki says its "in planning", though "in jeopardy" would be more accurate
[05:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> church_: Yeah, general support questions are in #jquery.
[05:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> This channel is for development of jQuery UI.
[05:50:52] <scott_gonzalez> church_: You shouldn't need a manually create a wrapper in all situations.
[05:51:05] <kborchers> hey jzaefferer long time no see â€¦ btw, thanks for not being around while i was in Germany :P
[05:51:06] <scott_gonzalez> So it's possible that we can improve the effect so you don't need to wrap.
[05:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> But without knowing exactly what you were doing, we won't know.
[05:51:34] <scott_gonzalez> So if you have time, it'd be good to see an example.
[05:51:44] <scott_gonzalez> If not, don't worry about it.
[05:52:19] <church_> cool , ill set it up as i have it in my project .. give me a bit
[05:53:10] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[05:57:40] <jzaefferer> kborchers: yeah, that was bad timing...
[05:57:54] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I even was in Berlin Thursday to Saturday
[05:58:15] <kborchers> :( too bad!
[05:58:23] <kborchers> jzaefferer: you're coming to portland though, right?
[05:58:30] <jzaefferer> kborchers: yeah
[05:58:32] <kborchers> cool
[06:01:43] <church_> scott_gonzalez: When i add it to jsfiddle is works 100% without the wrapper, maybe something with other parts of my code. http://jsfiddle.net/KcbkR/
[06:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[06:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have a doctype in your code?
[06:08:18] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, how is it like to get on the roadmap? little?
[06:09:50] <rxaviers> seems like diff widgets could use the same popup base, eg. menubar and datepicker. But, maybe it's not true. Im just asking
[06:10:05] <church_> scott_gonzalez: <!DOCTYPE html>
[06:10:33] <church_> i am using jquery mobile with jquery ui, could that be a problem?
[06:11:57] <scott_gonzalez> It shouldn't be, but it's possible that jQuery Mobile is adding some styling which is breaking the effect.
[06:30:22] <mazzachre> I have been tasked with getting resizable plugin to scroll it's container the same draggable works... Which is causing problems, I was wondering if anyone could help?
[06:31:08] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: Steven says menubar won't profit from using popup: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/668#issuecomment-16358518
[06:31:09] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Pull request #668 by rxaviers (10mon 2w ago): Popup: Fixes closing the popup unexpectedly by race conditions.
[06:31:35] <jzaefferer> that makes the datepicker rewrite the only widget that would actually use popup. Which is not a good starting point for a utility
[08:34:27] <andrew21> hi.. is it possible to report a bug over here?
[08:42:24] <scott_gonzalez> andrew21: Bug repots go to bugs.jqueryui.com.
[08:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> But if you're not sure whether it's a bug, you can ask here.
[08:42:38] <scott_gonzalez> Or provide a reduced test case on jsFiddle or jsbin.
[08:44:38] <andrew21> scott_gonzalez:  ok thanks.. for some reason im not able to fire events like show: function (event, ui)  inside a tab.. this happens in jquery ui 10.2. I have switched to 9.2 and it works fine
[08:45:11] <scott_gonzalez> andrew21: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/#removed-show-event-use-activate
[08:46:23] <andrew21> ill give it a try.. maybe i missed that part
[08:49:08] <andrew21> scott_gonzalez:  sorry to ask.. but how im suppose to change that line.. should i replace show with activate?
[08:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[08:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> andrew21: Note that the properties of the ui object have changed as well.
[08:50:02] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-show-event-renamed-to-activate
[08:52:25] <andrew21> scott_gonzalez:  http://jsfiddle.net/pzLze/
[08:52:58] <scott_gonzalez> andrew21: Did you read the details in the upgrade guide?
[08:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> panel is now newPanel
[09:27:16] <nschonni1> does jquery mobile have a separate channel? the docs and demos link on http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/03/22/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-2-1/ is 404ing
[10:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> nschonni1: #jquerymobile-dev
[10:40:40] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, that URL is working just fine for me.
[10:41:14] <nschonni1> the post url is fine, it's the docs & demos link on that page that 404s
[10:41:34] <nschonni1> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/
[10:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> oh, sorry
[10:41:59] <nschonni1> but I'll post it to the other room, even if it is probably mostly the same people :)
[10:42:02] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...well that's an infrastructure issue.
[10:42:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^
[10:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like all of their tags are broken.
[10:56:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm so glad people are spending their time making demos like http://codepen.io/zitrusfrisch/pen/fjbal :-/ Where is the USEFUL stuff?
[11:19:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hrm
[11:22:02] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: What's the current status of caring about things like maxcomplexity for jshint?
[12:39:09] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I still love maxcomplexity
[12:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> Want to get a discussion started on it?
[12:39:46] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe with results of which projects pass which settings?
[12:39:58] <scott_gonzalez> I can help gather stats if you want.
[12:40:08] <mikesherov> yes, that would be super helpful
[12:40:26] <scott_gonzalez> Were there other settings you wanted to use as well?
[12:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> Or reasons you think we shouldn't use other settings?
[12:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> I really just want to get rid of the maxcomplexity comments in UI if they're not going to be used, or get maxcomplexity added if we're going to be enforcing.
[12:42:22] <mikesherov> I think we should just raise the maxcomplexity to whatever will allow us to not have inline comments
[12:42:32] <mikesherov> and then slowly work our way down if we care about it
[12:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if we're setting it based on current code, it seems like we're either saying "We already have this solved, it's not an issue" or "We don't really care about maxcomplexity."
[12:44:23] <mikesherov> well
[12:44:28] <mikesherov> maybe that's true
[13:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/47
[13:56:13] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #47 by wgd (16h 17m ago): Demos not working because code.jquery.com is unavailable
[13:56:34] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't seem like anything we need to do, right?
[13:57:06] <Trylobot> anyone here from jquery ui team
[13:57:14] <gnarf> wtf
[13:57:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: close it
[13:57:45] <Trylobot> found an interesting component I'm thinking about integrating with jquery ui: https://github.com/thebrowser/jquery.ui.monthpicker
[13:57:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it's a non issue
[13:58:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i mean, there's nothing we can do to fix his dns
[13:58:04] <gnarf> our dns is legit
[14:03:21] <jzaefferer> I closed it :p
[14:03:40] <sonotos> Trylobot: do you know http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Timepicker-Addon if you find datepicker intresting you maybe like this one too
[14:04:45] <Trylobot> I do not, but the timepicker seems also to be a very logical extension of datepicker
[14:05:05] <sonotos> ack
[14:05:28] <Trylobot> the reason I'm here is I won't bother with the work or the pull request if the jquery-ui team is already aware of these and has decided not to integrate them with jquery-ui
[14:07:22] <Trylobot> if on the other hand the components would integrate well with the jquery-ui official distribution, and the only barrier is finding someone to do the work, I'd be happy to
[14:08:35] <sonotos> hm last time i asked if they are interested in a no binary img version of jquery ui with fontawesome and  + gradients. no reaction :-/
[18:54:37] <rxaviers> thanks gnarf, Im glad you liked it :)
[18:55:18] <rxaviers> (just saw your msg about the blog post)
[18:57:53] <rxaviers> (extending the thanks to fellow reviewers jzaefferer, ajpiano and scott_gonzalez)
[18:57:59] <rxaviers> :)
