[07:22:35] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom arschmitz gnarf jzaefferer kborchers rxaviers tj_vantoll uGoMobi: API design question. Don't look at existing code, just think about what behavior you expect...
[07:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> Given $( "<input disabled=disabled>" ).someWidget({ disabled: false }) what should happen?
[07:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> $( "<input> ").someWidget({ disabled: true })
[07:24:04] <kborchers> i would expect it to not be disabled in the first and disabled in the second
[07:24:05] <scott_gonzalez> $( "<input disabled>" ).someWidget({ disabled: null })
[07:24:25] <arschmitz> the first one should not be disabled the the second one should be disabled 
[07:24:40] <arschmitz> third one should be disabled
[07:25:25] <kborchers> disabled: null just seems weird to me ... because null is falsey i would almost want to say the third is not disabled
[07:25:41] <arschmitz> kborchers: null means check element
[07:25:44] <rxaviers> null sounds like nothing has been defined.
[07:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> I figured the first two wouldn't have any contention :-)
[07:25:57] <arschmitz> oh but i know the implementation already so thats cheating lol
[07:26:00] <kborchers> arschmitz: to you it means that
[07:26:01] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[07:26:14] <kborchers> to me just looking at the api it does not mean that
[07:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> So this is the logic that we've been using:
[07:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> null = read from the input.
[07:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> boolean = explicit value
[07:26:33] <arschmitz> kborchers: no your right im biased because im working on this already
[07:26:40] <gnarf> null / undefined = read from dom - bool = set to dom
[07:26:47] <scott_gonzalez> It seems strange that a user would explicitly pass null.
[07:26:50] <kborchers> that makes sense when it's explained but just looking at the api that is not intuitive
[07:26:58] <scott_gonzalez> But we do have a defined meaning for it.
[07:27:14] <rxaviers> gnarf, +1
[07:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> What really happens is we set the default to null to represent that it reads from the input.
[07:27:32] <gnarf> ^ 
[07:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> And so we have to document that null means that.
[07:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> And when you read it, it makes sense.
[07:28:00] <gnarf> undefined should also mean that as well 
[07:28:07] <gnarf> it does, since its the default
[07:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm bringing this up because right now selectmenu has a default of false, which isn't really true.
[07:28:11] <arschmitz> gnarf: agreed
[07:28:13] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that makes sense and as long as it's documented that's cool ... like i said, answering your initial question though, i would never intuitively come up with that
[07:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> Because it defaults to reading from the input.
[07:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> Well, from the select.
[07:28:29] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah this came up in button 2 weeks ago too
[07:28:37] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> And looking at the current implementation of button (not the rewrite), it's not using _getCreateOptions().
[07:28:58] <scott_gonzalez> But it is manually reimplementing the logic.
[07:29:03] <arschmitz> i like the implementation of using null but it does need to be explained to make sense
[07:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> Probably implemented before _getCreateOptions() existed.
[07:29:28] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah its moved to getCreateOptions in the rewrite 
[07:29:30] <gnarf> I think if I were attacking this without existing code, I would come up with: null / undefined = read from dom; bool = set to dom
[07:29:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, docs are necessary, but the good thing is nobody would ever pass null in the first place :-)
[07:29:52] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: right it makes no sense to actually pass it
[07:31:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: null doesn't make a ton of sense, undefined makes more sense - but since the == between the two is convinient ...

[07:33:05] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06master 14fd7e1e3 15Scott Gonz√°lez: Selectmenu: Default disabled option to null
[07:33:33] <rxaviers> An undefined value has definitively a more clear meaning in this context.
[07:38:19] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, is there a reason to keep `disabled: null` as default instead of simply removing it?
[07:38:33] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean by removing it?
[07:39:20] <rxaviers> deleting the `disabled: null` line
[07:39:39] <scott_gonzalez> Every option has a default.
[07:40:04] <rxaviers> Ok. So, I guess keeping a `disabled: null` reads better than `disabled: undefined`, right?

[07:40:05] <doesallmagic2> Scott Gonz√°lez: Selectmenu: Default disabled option to null
[07:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:40:20] <scott_gonzalez> We don't use undefined anywhere.
[07:40:23] <rxaviers> I see
[07:40:28] <rxaviers> makes sense
[07:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> Even callbacks have a default of null instead of undefined.
