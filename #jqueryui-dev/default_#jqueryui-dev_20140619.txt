[02:09:16] <gschulhof> jasperdegroot: Ping! http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/demos/table-column-toggle-custom-ui/page2.html
[02:09:26] <gschulhof> jasperdegroot: Also, resize the window below 640px
[02:11:44] <jasperdegroot> gschulhof: nice
[02:12:10] <gschulhof> jasperdegroot: I had to implement the breakpoint with JS though, because there's a lot of DOM manip happening at the breakpoint.
[02:12:37] <gschulhof> The only thing I could've done with a CSS media query is to show/hide the "Show/Hide Columns" button.
[02:12:39] <jasperdegroot> gschulhof: yeah, I can imagine
[02:13:05] <gschulhof> The controlgroup is actually ripped out of the popup and put back into the popup when the screen gets narrow.
[02:13:13] <gschulhof> The popup is generated by the columntoggle widget.
[02:15:20] <gschulhof> What's really cool is that the table's header can be turned into a fixed toolbar without having to move it outside the table: <table><thead><tr data-role="header" data-position="fixed">...</tr></thead>...</table>
[02:16:21] <jasperdegroot> gschulhof: cool!
[02:16:22] <gschulhof> Gonna test on some devices now ... *gulp*

[04:49:28] <gschulhof> jasperdegroot, arschmitz: *sigh* ... the demo looks good 'n all, but it no longer illustrates setColumnVisibility(), because it retains the checkboxes from the extension.
[04:49:56] <gschulhof> There's no point writing a custom UI that uses checkboxex, because we're re-implementing the extension.
[04:50:34] <arschmitz> gschulhof: not really true just dont use the extension and dont use the popup
[04:50:49] <arschmitz> and just do a navbar with checkboxes manually done like i suggested 
[04:51:10] <arschmitz> maybe not true nav bar but what looks like one
[04:51:11] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I've done that, but I've ripped the checkboxes out of the popup.
[04:51:23] <arschmitz> gschulhof: right dont do that lol and thats not what you have done
[04:51:34] <gschulhof> arschmitz: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/demos/table-column-toggle-custom-ui/#demo-page
[04:51:36] <arschmitz> the bottom is not at all a nav bar its a footer with a controlgroup and a back button
[04:51:42] <arschmitz> _zoggy_: iv looked already
[04:51:53] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i mean ugh nick changes will take a bit lol
[04:52:05] <gschulhof> Yeah, sorry ...
[04:52:11] <jasperdegroot> lol
[04:52:16] <arschmitz> gschulhof: no i prefer new name just habits...
[04:52:19] <gschulhof> I'm not used to seeing my new nick either.
[04:52:34] <gschulhof> I've had the old nick for over 10 years.
[04:53:04] <gschulhof> OK, then, I guess, I'll reproduce some of the extension.
[04:53:31] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Thing is, though, I don't want the checkboxes to always be arranged horizontally, because that defeats the purpose of accommodating narrow screens.
[04:53:45] <gschulhof> arschmitz: The way I have it now, it switches to using the popup when the screen gets narrow.
[04:53:49] <arschmitz> gschulhof: no it dosnt
[04:54:01] <arschmitz> we use navbars on all sizes they adjust their width
[04:54:06] <arschmitz> thats the whole point of a navbar
[04:54:20] <arschmitz> its not like you have 10 columns
[04:54:39] <arschmitz> gschulhof: you have 5 which is the max for a navbar
[04:54:40] <gschulhof> I suppose it can fit horizontally on most screens
[04:55:00] <arschmitz> gschulhof: you can on all screens
[04:55:04] <gschulhof> Well, OK.
[04:55:08] <arschmitz> you actually only have 4
[04:55:26] <arschmitz> because title is not optional
[04:55:45] <arschmitz> but might want to make first one a back button so 5
[04:56:09] <arschmitz> though really you dont need a back button
[04:56:29] <arschmitz> unless its an ios phonegap or homescreen app there is always one available
[04:56:39] <gschulhof> OK.
[04:57:06] <arschmitz> gschulhof: might suggest removing fullscreen from toolbars too the opacity is weird and you cant see last row without hiding
[04:57:30] <arschmitz> gschulhof: just footer actually header is fine
[04:58:14] <gschulhof> Ummm ... huh ... I left tap-toggle in there, and now I'm getting two scrollbars.
[04:58:24] <gschulhof> ... when the footer is not fixed.
[04:58:40] <gschulhof> I'll take the easy way out: no tap toggle.
[04:59:00] <arschmitz> gschulhof: hmmm likely an issue with table margins or something
[05:01:41] <gschulhof> Ummm ... we have a problem with the swipe-page on master.
[05:02:13] <gschulhof> The background picture is not displayed correctly, and the trivia button doesn't work.
[05:02:34] <gschulhof> Wow! Going to the prev/next city doesn't work either.
[05:03:12] <gschulhof> OK. We've got exceptions. We can't release like this.
[05:03:56] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i got it its nothing major
[05:04:52] <gschulhof> Oh, OK.

[05:04:58] <gschulhof> Well, then, you can take ^
[05:05:20] <arschmitz> gschulhof: not sure why we dont have a test for this its broken like 5 times
[05:05:51] <gschulhof> arschmitz: yeah, we just check for 404s.
[05:06:01] <arschmitz> gschulhof: no not that
[05:06:17] <arschmitz> its not making sure options is actually defined in loadpage before checking it
[05:06:27] <gschulhof> Oh, I see what you mean.
[05:06:39] <arschmitz> we have had this issue like a dozen times
[05:06:49] <arschmitz> im not sure why we have no tests catching it
[05:07:17] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Are we using deprecated page events on that demo?
[05:07:22] <gschulhof> We shouldn't bt.
[05:07:23] <gschulhof> be.
[05:07:36] <arschmitz> im not sure its not the event thats the issue its the method
[05:08:02] <arschmitz> its when you call loadpage / load method of pagecontainer and dont pass a second param
[05:08:05] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Also, the navbar isn't looking that great. It wants to have a single active entry, so it acts like a radio button group, but that's not what I want.
[05:08:10] <arschmitz> internally there is always a second param
[05:08:23] <arschmitz> gschulhof: dont actually use a navbar
[05:08:27] <arschmitz> just make it look like one
[05:08:39] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Oh, like a grid with checkboxes.
[05:08:47] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yeah
[05:08:59] <arschmitz> navbars are made for links so they wont really work
[05:14:19] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Weeeell, the checkbox doesn't really look that nice. What I really want is a horizontal controlgroup checkbox ... see for yourself: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/demos/table-column-toggle-custom-ui/#demo-page
[05:15:05] <arschmitz> gschulhof: you just need to write custom styles
[05:15:15] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I think so.
[05:15:15] <arschmitz> remove border radius padding margins etc
[05:15:25] <arschmitz> but use the grid still
[05:15:41] <arschmitz> gschulhof: probably can steal navbar css

[05:26:22] <gschulhof> Wow! Super-neat! http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/demos/table-column-toggle-custom-ui/#demo-page
[05:26:48] <gschulhof> Instantiates both a controlgroup and a toolbar on the same element!
[05:27:06] <gschulhof> I wish I could do data-role="footer,controlgroup"
[05:27:12] <arschmitz> _zoggy_: its all broken though
[05:27:15] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i mean
[05:27:30] <gschulhof> arschmitz: The top is. I yanked the code that fixes the widths.
[05:27:40] <arschmitz> gschulhof: it does not toggle either
[05:27:47] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Nono. There's no code yet.
[05:27:52] <gschulhof> arschmitz: It's just the style.
[05:28:14] <arschmitz> gschulhof: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1452/edit
[05:28:27] <arschmitz> css only and only 1 custom rule
[05:29:15] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I had that, but I didn't like the checkboxes, because there's too little difference between checked and not checked.
[05:29:40] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I wanted the whole checkbox to turn blue when it was checked. Only a horizontal controlgroup can get me that.
[05:29:58] <gschulhof> ... and custom CSS, of course, but we already have the CSS in the controlgroup.
[05:30:04] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yeah thats fixed in the re-write 
[05:30:16] <arschmitz> for ui
[05:30:31] <arschmitz> it gets active state no matter what when its checked
[05:30:38] <gschulhof> Oh, cool!
[05:30:42] <arschmitz> gschulhof: and you can toggle the icon at will
[05:30:51] <gschulhof> Well, that's neat.
[05:30:57] <arschmitz> so it can have an icon in either orientation of controlgroup
[05:31:17] <arschmitz> or by it self it can be a toggle button by just turning off the icon
[05:35:00] <gschulhof> Hmmm ... controlgroup is not so good. When the window gets narrow, "Rotten Tomato Rating" starts to wrap, and so its button becomes taller than the other three :/
[05:35:23] <arschmitz> gschulhof: thats a simple fix
[05:35:29] <arschmitz> whitespace: no-wrap
[05:35:40] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Aaah, excellent!
[05:35:43] <arschmitz> text-overflow: elipsis
[05:35:55] <arschmitz> will make it act like in a nav bar when it cuts off
[05:36:55] <arschmitz> gschulhof: seems like you almost might want to do a enhanced controlgroup and checkboxes
[05:37:05] <arschmitz> then you can put only the classes ypu want
[05:37:21] <arschmitz> so mix and match controlgroup and navbar classes
[05:38:10] <gschulhof> True.
[05:38:24] <gschulhof> No need to add classes at runtime.
[05:38:32] <gschulhof> But this is not too bad either.
[06:10:20] <gschulhof> arschmitz: How about now? http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/demos/table-column-toggle-custom-ui/#demo-page

[10:20:42] <gschulhof> I'm here.
[10:20:57] <arschmitz> im not sure what you mean by your first comment
[10:21:04] <arschmitz> it is an actual page
[10:21:34] <gschulhof> page-does-not-exist.html?
[10:21:42] <gschulhof> Well, the name has definitely fooled me :)
[10:22:34] <arschmitz> gschulhof: weird ok so yeah i copied wrong one it does not
[10:22:39] <arschmitz> but some how that is working
[10:22:54] <arschmitz> gschulhof: because that test passes when the issues is fixed and fails when it is not
[10:23:14] <arschmitz> gschulhof: any idea why?
[10:23:17] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yes, it fails because there's an exception, but it doesn't fail because the ok() evaluates to false.
[10:23:37] <gschulhof> arschmitz: ... and qunit traps exceptions and considers them failures.
[10:23:38] <arschmitz> oh right which is actually more or less what i actually wanted
[10:24:00] <arschmitz> because the test is to make sure there is not an execption when you dont pass a second param
[10:24:09] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Actually, you should probably be expecting pagecontainerloadfailed rather than pagecontainerload.
[10:24:36] <gschulhof> ... and then assert that result.pagecontainerloadfailed.timedOut is false.
[10:24:58] <arschmitz> gschulhof: hmm does qunit have a convention for testing for an execption specificly i wonder?
[10:25:04] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: ^^
[10:25:14] <gschulhof> Good question.
[10:25:45] <arschmitz> gschulhof: because thats really what i want to do and any other way we do it is just faking that basicly
[10:25:50] <gschulhof> arschmitz: You could try { pagecontainer.pagecontainer( "load", otherPageUrl ); } catch( e ) { ok( false ); }
[10:26:23] <gschulhof> arschmitz: No need for qunit sugar.
[10:26:59] <arschmitz> gschulhof: well you could write every assertion and catch your self but then what the point of qunit 
[10:27:00] <gschulhof> arschmitz: That would actually be a lot faster, because you could make the test synchronous.
[10:27:39] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Well, no, because in this case we're dealing with an exception during execution, rather than a successful execution with an incorrect outcome.
[10:27:46] <arschmitz> gschulhof: http://api.qunitjs.com/throws/
[10:28:10] <gschulhof> Well, there you have it.
[10:35:00] <arschmitz> ok so ill update to just do that lol
[10:54:30] <gschulhof> arschmitz: You should probably still expect pagecontainerloadfailed and only start when that's come in, because otherwise you may throw off subsequent tests we may write.
[10:54:49] <gschulhof> arschmitz: That is, the pagecontainer should be quiescent when you call start().
[10:55:35] <arschmitz> gschulhof: hmm maybe what i have right now is i switched to a sync test and just wrap the call in throws
[10:56:23] <gschulhof> That's bad though, because the next test, if we ever write a next test, may end up getting tripped up by the pagecontainerloadfailed.
[10:56:41] <gschulhof> Tests shouldn't trip each other up like that, because it's hell to debug.
[10:57:09] <gschulhof> A call to load() always results in some asynchronous event - either pagecontainerload or pagecontainerloadfailed.
[10:57:25] <gschulhof> That event must come and go before we can call start() and move on to the next test.
[10:57:48] <arschmitz> gschulhof: instead i should just mock the call
[10:58:14] <arschmitz> so it never throws pagecontainerloadfailed
[10:58:17] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yes, actually, but you must make sure that it gets far enough into the actual call to execute the line you've modified.
[10:58:21] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yeah.
[10:58:58] <gschulhof> Doesn't load() call some internal function before it initiates the Ajax request, but after it passes the point you wish to test?
[10:59:19] <gschulhof> If so, you can mock the internal function, throw an exception, and catch it back in the test.
[10:59:34] <gschulhof> That way, you will have tested a section of code that encompases part of load().
[10:59:42] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yeah triggerwithdeprecated is immeditly following
[10:59:52] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Oh, excellent.
[11:00:11] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Then you can just preventDefault() there, because that's all synchronous.
[11:00:20] <arschmitz> yup!
[11:00:46] <arschmitz> and its the very next line which checks if its been prevented
[11:00:59] <arschmitz> so its a perfect catch zero code inbetween
[11:01:10] <gschulhof> Cool!
[11:01:53] <gschulhof> arschmitz: ... although that'd make it more of a unit test than an integration test, so you /should/ actually move it to tests/unit/pagecontainer ... technically.
[11:02:13] <arschmitz> gschulhof: yup ill move it

[11:19:46] <jzaefferer> arschmitz gschulhof: http://api.qunitjs.com/throws
[11:20:09] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah found it already thank you!
[11:20:37] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: but how does that work to make sure you dont get an error
[11:20:48] <arschmitz> it seems like its designed to make sure one IS thrown
[11:22:26] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: yeah, that's what it does
[11:22:44] <jzaefferer> QUnit runs your test in a try/catch block and will report any exceptions throw
[11:22:57] <jzaefferer> *thrown; so you don't need to worry about that
[11:22:58] <arschmitz> right i want to write a test that simply ensure no error is thrown
[11:23:11] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: and i know it works to just call the method and qunit catches
[11:23:41] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i just was not sure the proper way to handle it if i should just call it and not worry and say hey let qunit catch it
[11:23:47] <arschmitz> or if i should do my own try catch
[11:23:55] <arschmitz> or whatever
[11:24:04] <jzaefferer> whatever, exactly :p
[11:24:24] <arschmitz> lol ok
[11:24:27] <jzaefferer> Let QUnit handle it or use your own try block, doesn't make much of a difference
[11:24:35] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: cool

[11:38:56] <arschmitz> gschulhof: am i going crazy all the pagecontainer tests are gone
[11:39:01] <arschmitz> execpt the ones you just wrote
[11:40:00] <gschulhof> Wha ... ? There were some under content/
[11:40:37] <gschulhof> arschmitz: A comprehensive way to check is to count the number of assertions in a last-known-good commit and then in the suspicious one.
[11:40:54] <arschmitz> gschulhof: it looks like john never wrote any
[11:41:00] <arschmitz> but i swear he had like hundreds
[11:41:33] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Well, navigation has lots, and tests/unit/content has some.
[11:41:48] <arschmitz> gschulhof: they are all indirect
[11:41:58] <arschmitz> just ones changed to fix them because they would have been broken
[11:42:07] <gschulhof> arschmitz: content isn't that indirect, because the pagecontainer widget used to be called content.
[11:42:30] <arschmitz> right but its still just an adapted old test
[11:42:39] <arschmitz> it does not look like any new tests were ever written
[11:42:48] <arschmitz> thats extreamly concerning 
[11:44:20] <arschmitz> gschulhof: dont you think?
[11:45:41] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure.
[11:46:06] <gschulhof> Well, we're reviewing it anyway, aren't we? So, that's the perfect time to write tests.
[11:46:18] <gschulhof> I know as I was reviewing table I wrote lots of tests.
[11:46:23] <arschmitz> gschulhof: kinda yeah but man ...
[11:46:32] <arschmitz> this is crazy
[11:46:57] <gschulhof> We were teetering on the edge of a precipice all this time.
[12:00:43] <arschmitz> gschulhof: it pushes it to the end of the stackso after all sync calls complete before it
[12:01:00] <arschmitz> but a 1ms waits 1ms before pushing to back of stack
[12:01:21] <arschmitz> gschulhof: and there is no reason to make tests take longer then they need to
[12:02:51] <arschmitz> gschulhof: so if you have a 0 and a 1 ms time out in the same sync call then the 1ms will always execute after the 0ms one
[12:03:34] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, that's all I was asking. If setTimeout(, 0) is basically synchronous in the sense that it is inserted deterministically after the current frame, then I'm good with a timeout of 1.
[12:03:37] <arschmitz> gschulhof: a set timeout is only even checked once the current sync call completes
[12:04:27] <arschmitz> gschulhof: thats why the time in a setimeout is just a min time
[12:05:36] <gschulhof> arschmitz: I wanna ask this question from some browser developers, but the only ones I know are on vacation until Monday.
[12:07:50] <gschulhof> arschmitz: For example, what if an Ajax request completes during the execution of the current frame? If you setTimeout( function x(){}, 0 ) during the current frame /after/ the request has completed in real time, will the events related to the request fire before the timeout, or after the timeout?
[12:09:28] <arschmitz> gschulhof: ahh but here is the thing
[12:10:26] <jasperdegroot> pfff IRC is driving me crazy tonight :(
[12:10:39] <gschulhof> :/
[12:14:37] <gschulhof> arschmitz: Where's the thing?
[12:22:40] <arschmitz> gschulhof: i was trying to verify something lol and stoped mid sentance
[12:23:46] <arschmitz> gschulhof: oh i know how to test this
[12:25:52] <arschmitz> gschulhof: DOH
[12:25:59] <arschmitz> its not the same in all browsers
