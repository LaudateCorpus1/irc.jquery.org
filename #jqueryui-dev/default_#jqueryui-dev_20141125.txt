[07:49:54] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: thanks for the review
[07:50:05] <mikesherov> is that all you had, or should I be expecting more?
[08:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I think that's it. I didn't do cross-browser testing, just tested in Chrome.
[08:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> I figure you probably discovered the cross-browser issues by now.
[08:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I also wanted to verify that old effects still work.
[08:12:59] <mikesherov> yeah
[08:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> Confirmed that old effects work with back compat enabled.
[08:16:48] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm done with my review :-)
[08:39:51] <mikesherov> Great!
[09:15:18] <lisa_deluca> of the jquery mobile themes there is there one that is recommended to have a look and feel that is more inline with native ios/android? since the default one is very obviously not native
[09:32:33] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: I believe people have made custom jQM themes. IINM they're listed under http://jquerymobile.com/resources/#Themes .... dunno how up-to-date those themes are.
[09:32:34] <b-ot> gabriel_schulhof: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.

[13:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I just had a thought about classes.
[13:47:15] <arschmitz> yeah?
[13:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> What if we had this._addClass( elems, key, extraClasses )
[13:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> And this._removeClass( elems, key, extraClasses )
[13:47:58] <arschmitz> i kinda like that
[13:48:11] <scott_gonzalez> Then the need for _classesFromObject() goes away, right?
[13:48:13] <arschmitz> it cleans up a lot of this.element.addclass( huge string of stuff
[13:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> Because the widget factory can just track everything on its own.
[13:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> Just like it does for event handlers.
[13:48:42] <arschmitz> so you mean construct its own object as it goes?
[13:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:48:49] <arschmitz> yeah i feel like we talked about that idea
[13:49:01] <arschmitz> but not sure why we didnt do it ill try it
[13:49:12] <scott_gonzalez> Might save us lots of bytes.
[13:49:12] <arschmitz> maybe we just talked about it and i never actually implemented it
[13:49:21] <scott_gonzalez> And also reduce the chance of bugs in individual widgets.
[13:49:22] <arschmitz> either way i like it
[13:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> I know we discussed something similar, but I don't remember what the difference was.
[13:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> Whatever it was, we talked through the implementation and found a reason it wouldn't work.
[13:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> But I think this method will work.
[13:50:07] <arschmitz> not sure it was when we were just spitballing about ideas
[13:50:11] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:50:25] <arschmitz> so yeah i cant think of why this would not work
[13:50:44] <arschmitz> and it should make is smaller and the calls actually a lot more sane
[13:51:30] <arschmitz> i really dont care for all the calls with the structure this.thing.addClass this._class( "some long string" ) + " some other long string" );
[13:51:47] <arschmitz> its just kinda gross to look at
[13:52:31] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ill work on that in the morning
[13:52:38] <scott_gonzalez> awesome, thanks
[13:52:40] <arschmitz> see if i can have something basic to show in the meeting
[13:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be great.
[15:29:26] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: where do you see scale show not animating?
[15:35:40] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: nvm I see it
