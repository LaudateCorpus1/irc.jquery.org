[04:21:17] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: im not sure thats a fair test with one haveing 100 icons :-)
[12:58:49] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I wanted to add a demo for the the ui-widget-icon-floatend/beginning classes, but I don't think the button widget's classes options supports changing the classes of the icon span. Or does it?
[13:40:05] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I don't believe that should make a difference, because the listviews are never rendered - otherwise the page would jump around like crazy. Still, I'll take out the CSS and try again.
[13:50:53] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Here it is, without the CSS. The result is pretty much the same: http://jsperf.com/listview-145-vs-150/3
