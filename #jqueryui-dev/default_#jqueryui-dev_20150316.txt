[02:47:10] <M4rius> Hi, I am creating a PR for merging master into interactions, just so I don't trip over before I even reach the starting line: I would create a PR with the target being the interactions branch and I wrote some description of what I did. Should I also add the description to the body of the commit(s) ? Is there more to consider?
[03:01:15] <M4rius> (ping jzaefferer)
[03:04:54] <jzaefferer> M4rius: that sounds good to me; not sure if there's more, PR would definitely help
[03:05:23] <M4rius> Alrighty, I will fire away :)
[03:05:42] <jzaefferer> M4rius: once you're at the starting line, you should start working on a proposal, if you haven't already. See also https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/issues/1
[03:06:26] <M4rius> Ok swell, will do

[05:27:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:28:14] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Hi
[05:28:57] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:29:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7988#discussion_r26296568 What exactly should be outerHeight()?
[05:29:51] <arschmitz> the calls to height
[05:30:06] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so the comparison, right?
[05:30:18] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because you cannot set outerHeight(), only retrieve it.
[05:30:31] <arschmitz> you can set it
[05:31:02] <arschmitz> and you do want to set it there
[05:31:29] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: http://api.jquery.com/outerheight/#outerHeight2
[05:32:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you want to use outerheight because you want to account for the margins because you want it to fit the screen
[05:32:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, and I don't want it to cause the document height to increase.
[05:32:22] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[05:32:33] <arschmitz> yup
[05:32:49] <gabriel_schulhof> So, when I retrieve the height of the document I use .height(), because obviously the document doesn't have margins, etc.
[05:32:58] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but for the panel, I get/set outerHeight()
[05:33:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Also, what if the panel has margins?
[05:33:10] <arschmitz> i dont think it makes any difference as far as the returned value
[05:33:27] <arschmitz> you should use outer height to account for that
[05:33:37] <gabriel_schulhof> When you set outerHeight(), does that mean that the resulting .outerHeight( true ) of the panel will be whatever you set it to?
[05:33:58] <arschmitz> yesim not sure if it does true or not as a setter
[05:34:24] <arschmitz> pretty sure it does i need to check though
[05:34:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Nono, not as a setter. What I'm asking is this: panel.outerHeight( 500 ); panel.outerHeight( true ) === 500; panel.outerHeight() === 500;
[05:34:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Which of the two comparisons is true, assuming the panel has a non-zero margin?
[05:35:10] <arschmitz> right thats what i was saying i needed to check
[05:35:15] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[05:35:22] <gabriel_schulhof> I can do a quick jsbin.
[05:37:19] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: panel.outerHeight() === 500
[05:37:35] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/celuni/1/edit
[05:39:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[05:39:47] <gabriel_schulhof> I just found myself.
[05:40:05] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I must compare to outerHeight( true ), and I must set it compensating for that.
[05:40:28] <arschmitz> im not really sure its worth it
[05:40:35] <arschmitz> panels i dont think ever have margins
[05:40:40] <arschmitz> top or bottom
[05:40:53] <gabriel_schulhof> We cannot know what custom styling people will dream up.
[05:41:04] <gabriel_schulhof> There are panels that look like they don't reach quite to the top of the page.
[05:41:10] <arschmitz> since when do we support any random style people can dream up?
[05:41:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, if people want rounded corners.
[05:41:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I think this is within reason.
[05:42:14] <arschmitz> yeah im this seems reasonable i guess
[05:44:12] <alokrajiv_> I am interested in GSoc 2015 for contributing to the Jquery project.
[05:44:33] <arschmitz> alokrajiv_: which project are you interested in?
[05:47:48] <alokrajiv_> archmitz: I particularly liked the 'slider rewrite' project.
[05:49:49] <arschmitz> alokrajiv_: ok have you looked at https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students and http://contribute.jquery.org/
[05:49:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: http://jsbin.com/bodira/1/ I think that looks kinda cool, actually.
[05:51:03] <arschmitz> i assume that does not include this fix since it scrolls lol
[05:51:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Of course not :) That's git.
[05:51:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Just the gap at the top is kinda cool.
[05:51:30] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i didnt look at the code you sent the fullscreen
[05:52:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, true. Sorry!
[05:52:29] <gabriel_schulhof> I just took the template and added a bit of style just to see what it'd look like.
[05:53:02] <gabriel_schulhof> The bottom of the panel is broken. This should fix that.
[05:53:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Sweet!
[06:08:02] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, ummm ... I can't discard onevar because of jshint.
[06:08:19] <gabriel_schulhof> I guess we'll have to formally turn that off.
[06:08:28] <gabriel_schulhof> ... in a separate PR.
[06:09:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: dont do it yet
[06:10:02] <arschmitz> it will be confusing
[06:10:15] <arschmitz> and jzaefferer has already submitted prs using esformater for most or all of ui
[06:10:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I couldn't even if I wanted to, because the linter will get me.
[06:10:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well thats why there are settings :-)
[06:11:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes, but modifying them is beyond the scope of the stretch-the-external-panel PR.
[06:17:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Before I forget: The switch to proper UMD boilerplate: Do I do that on master or ui-1-12?
[06:17:47] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i really wish they were the same
[06:18:38] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ui-1-12 this will break the git build in the download builder
[06:18:49] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15roemhildtg opened issue #8004: Panel Disappears When Leaflet Map is in Main Content (IE 10,11) 02http://git.io/hUi7
[06:19:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Fix one panel bug, get another ... heh ...
[06:19:19] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[06:19:23] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll do it on ui-1-12.
[06:19:38] <gabriel_schulhof> ui-1-12 will have a bunch of new files, anyway, what with all the backcompat modules.
[06:19:52] <arschmitz> yup
[06:20:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im almost wondering if we are getting to the point where we should start doing everything on ui-1-12 
[06:20:30] <arschmitz> its diverged so much
[06:21:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: or maybe rename in 1.5-pre
[06:21:44] <arschmitz> and it will be like master but with occasional rebasing 
[06:21:48] <arschmitz> lol
[06:32:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, it is, essentially ...
[06:32:32] <gabriel_schulhof> We would do well to merge in all the fixes on master though ...
[06:32:45] <gabriel_schulhof> I worry we might lose some when we do, finally, rebase.
[06:33:54] <gabriel_schulhof> I would almost take it step by step. That is, rebase onto the next commit on master, and make sure it's all good. Then the next commit, and then the next, and so forth, until ui-1-12 sits on top of the HEAD of master.
[06:34:31] <gabriel_schulhof> It's super tedious, but at least the conflicts are spread out better, and any one conflict is confined to one component.
[06:34:47] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and it's basically all fixes coming from master.
[06:35:15] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and let's not forget: ui-1-12 is no straight line, either - it has a bunch of classes PRs branching off.
[06:39:20] <gabriel_schulhof> But anyway ... I'd be happy to do the mega-merge ... 
[06:45:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: iv been rebasing master along the way already
[06:52:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: there you go up to date with master

[11:10:45] <M4rius> I just realized that there is the Draggable API, the Dropable API and the Sortable API in the interactions branch as well. And I thought it was just the Interaction API :X
[11:13:05] <M4rius> So updating interactions to the current master is multiple magnitudes bigger than I thought. Damn those pigs and their appreciation for playing in the mud.
