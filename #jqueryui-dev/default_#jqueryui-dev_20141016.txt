[04:38:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[04:40:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7775, it seems like we could use an event when a transition is at the halfway point. That's pointless with slide, but it's good for all the others.
[04:41:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Right now, the hash processing demo, which uses samePageTransition: true to make a single page look like multiple pages can be seen to be turning the active page into the destination page before the transition even starts.
[04:41:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: This should be happening at the halfway point.
[04:42:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I wonder if we could do this with a progress indicator on the transition deferred ...

[05:21:50] <doesallmagic2> Scott Gonz√°lez: Selectmenu: Preserve text selection and button focus on click
[05:22:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we already have that for everyone execpt slide
[05:30:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We do? What's the halfway event?
[05:31:07] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: pagehide
[05:31:10] <arschmitz> on the first page
[05:31:32] <arschmitz> or pagecontainerhide :-)
[05:32:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm .... OK ... I'll change the demo to use pagecontainerhide then.
[05:33:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The fact is, for the purposes of fixing that bug, pagecontainer needs a helping hand with when to call $.mobile.removeActiveLinkClass().
[05:33:57] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Although I suppose I should add a call to removeActiveLinkClass to be in synch with triggering pagecontainerhide, but only if settings.samePageTransition is true.
[05:34:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Alright ... I'll look into these things in about 3-4 hours.

[07:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ping
[07:08:04] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: pj√∂ng
[07:08:33] <scott_gonzalez> On a fresh `npm install` for jqueryui.com, I get the following error:
[07:09:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, my terminal is now being annoying and I'm having trouble copying/scrolling/even switching to it.
[07:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> But download builder was complaining about 1.9.2 not being there and needing to run `grunt prepare` first.
[07:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> When I was trying to deploy.
[07:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm doing that manually right now, but do you know why this is happening?
[07:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like this problem keeps popping up.
[07:19:41] <jzaefferer> That happened during `npm install`? Not `grunt deploy`?
[07:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> It happened during `grunt deploy`.
[07:22:54] <jzaefferer> Okay
[07:24:04] <jzaefferer> build-download runs `grunt prepare`; build-download is part of the `build` target, which `grunt deploy` runs. It should output "Initializing download module, might take a while..." at some point, thats logged before running `grunt prepare`
[07:24:29] <jzaefferer> If that happens and it still complains, there must be something wrong in download.jqueryui.com itself
[07:25:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what happened. I'm doing it again from another fresh `npm install`.
[07:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'll paste the output if it fails again.
[07:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/25a2fdf8238d8c85d5fe
[07:33:14] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: okay, that's a bug; makes no sense to run `grunt prepare` again while running `grunt prepare`
[07:40:31] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats the error i was telling you about the other night

[07:43:11] <jquicommit> 13jqueryui.com/06master 142ab3ea3 15Scott Gonz√°lez: Changelog: Add 1.11.2 changelog
[08:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, we didn't even upgrade to jQuery 1.11.1 before doing this release.
[08:00:23] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I should update this to the latest version of core we've tested against, right? https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/config.json#L20
[08:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> Which is 1.10.2.
[08:01:00] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like we didn't update it for the last release.
[08:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> Seems a bit dangerous to be including the same version of core in all UI releases.
[08:02:40] <scott_gonzalez> This should probably be a per-version config value.
[08:04:18] <gseguin> mornin'
[08:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> We still average about 500 downloads per day for 1.9.2.
[08:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> That's 15k per month. JUST UPGRADE ALREADY!
[08:04:42] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats cool but kinda a bummer
[08:05:03] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: So i'm looking into the safelyBlur method based on your comments.  But I dont think I'm doing it right
[08:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's basically the same for 1.10.4.
[08:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like 1.9.2 is shipping core 1.8.3. So I'm not really sure what's up with this config value.
[08:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> And 1.11.1 is shipping 1.10.2 from the externals.
[08:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> So I really have no idea what this config value is doing.
[08:08:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just leave it.

[08:13:04] <doesallmagic2> * Scott Gonz√°lez: 2.0.17
[08:13:11] <gseguin> ok, ping me back
[08:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I've got a few minutes while this builds.
[08:15:09] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: What's up?
[08:15:28] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I have a ui autocomplete input
[08:15:39] <gseguin> there is a programmatic call to .focus on it
[08:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I think this is going to die trying to generate the quick download because of the 1.9.2 problem.
[08:16:00] <gseguin> and that calls triggers a delayed click event
[08:16:07] <gseguin> sorry not exacly that
[08:16:22] <gseguin> so there is a .focus() call
[08:16:30] <gseguin> which doesn't work on iOS
[08:16:41] <gseguin> then when you tap the field 
[08:16:47] <gseguin> it focuses
[08:16:56] <gseguin> brings up the keyboard
[08:17:10] <gseguin> and then the 300ms delayed click event happens
[08:17:25] <gseguin> but that does not happen if there is no call to .focus()
[08:17:35] <gseguin> any idea what I'm running into?
[08:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> You're running into years of pain because Apple is a bunch of standards-hating bastards.
[08:18:16] <gseguin> :D
[08:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> But on a more technical note, no I have no idea why a programmatic focus which doesn't even work would cause that problem.
[08:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> Have you seen .focus() not working in other places in iOS?
[08:19:01] <arschmitz> gseguin: is that focus call when the page loads?
[08:19:03] <scott_gonzalez> Is this new in iOS 8?
[08:19:33] <gseguin> arschmitz not exactly, it's happens after a section is revealed
[08:19:44] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have a working jqueryui.com?
[08:19:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: you cant programaticly focus on ios until after the user has interacted in some way 
[08:19:55] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: correct in iOS 8 though I haven't tested other versions
[08:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> Is this .focus() from inside autocomplete or is this something outside of the plugin?
[08:20:38] <gseguin> arschmitz: user clicks a radio which reveals a input field then .focus() is called
[08:20:50] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: outside the plugin
[08:21:13] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: let me try to build a simplified test case and share it with you
[08:21:37] <gseguin> I wanted to run it by you before I spend the time to see if it was something obvious
[08:23:34] * gseguin gets off the bus and walks to the office
[08:24:22] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: my local jqueryui.com is screwed, just like my local api.jqueryui.com. Deploys are extremely slow, takes forever to sync to WordPress
[08:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[08:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> I can't generate the quick downloads, so I can't get the site updated.
[08:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try something.
[08:25:30] <scott_gonzalez> I removed 1.9.2 from my local config. We'll see if it builds without it.
[08:28:29] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's finally time for me to move "review download builder" to the top of my list.
[08:30:42] <scott_gonzalez> YAY, that worked.

[08:48:02] <ldeluca> does anyone know how to use console.log within jquery build?  When I run i get an error 'console' is not defined for jshint
[08:53:09] <scott_gonzalez> ldeluca: You can either remove the lint step from the build or you can edit .jshintrc to allow console.
[08:53:16] <scott_gonzalez> Just make sure not to commit either change.
[08:53:50] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to edit .jshintrc, add `"devel": true`
[08:54:16] <ldeluca> scott_gonzalez: thank you!
[08:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to remove the linting, edit the bottom of Gruntfile.js
[08:56:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm gonna run some errands, but once we figure out what's wrong with download builder, we can finish the release.
[08:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> Just need to push the tags and publish the blog post (already written).

[10:33:03] <arschmitz> brian1001: this would definitely not be the place to ask about sencha :-) try #jquery
[10:42:04] <ldeluca> arschmitz: what are the versions of Android jQuery mobile is officially supporting?  is 2.3.5 still supported?
[10:42:20] <arschmitz> ldeluca: yup
[10:42:32] <ldeluca> arschmitz: thanks
[10:42:32] <arschmitz> 2.3.x and 4.0+

[10:43:54] <ldeluca> arschmitz: yea, i think you told me before... bookmarking this time :)
[10:44:11] <arschmitz> ldeluca: the execption being we only support ie8+ no matter what 
[10:44:18] <arschmitz> which is what core i thought should be
[10:44:40] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I'm here now. What's up?
[10:47:31] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: mind taking a look at my pull request and let me know what i did wrong: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7757#discussion_r18922258
[10:47:44] <ldeluca> seeing some failures in the test
[10:49:18] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Sure!
[10:51:43] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I'd git reset --hard HEAD~1 && git push -f origin 7533-popup-blue-flash
[10:51:54] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: IOW, lop off the last commit and return the PR to its previous state.
[10:52:21] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I may not have expressed my idea clearly enough. Sorry!
[10:53:33] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: What I was trying to say is that, in _openPrerequisitesComplete(), we should run this._ui.container.find( ":focusable" ).first(), and, if the resulting jQuery object contains any elements, i.e., has length > 0, we should overwrite this._ui.focusElement with that jQuery object.
[10:54:04] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: That way, when _handleDocumentFocusIn() fires, focus is shifted to the first focusable element inside the popup, instead of the popup container itself.
[10:54:33] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: If, OTOH, in our search we find no useful focusable elements inside the popup container, well, we do what we do now, i.e., we have no focus chain.

[11:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> If you got past that task.
[11:58:56] <arschmitz> yup iv never got this far before

[12:03:43] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: If you look at one of my classes PRs (say, popup), you will see that I follow a very specific pattern for implementing the classes option, and for providing backward compatibility for the various style options.
[12:04:05] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: The code in that commit is the result of my having to write the same code for, like, every widget.

[12:05:13] <cgack> gabriel_schulhof: right on. I dig it
[12:09:18] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: is there anything i need to do before grunt deploy?
[12:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> nope

[12:11:02] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: huh even with vagrant up its still failing on the validate task
[12:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> What's the error?
[12:11:27] <arschmitz> oh its events
[12:11:35] <arschmitz> i need to pull and deploy events first
[12:11:58] <arschmitz> wow thats annoying you can depoly any site local now without the events site
[12:12:00] <scott_gonzalez> What error are you getting?
[12:12:11] <arschmitz> events.js:72
[12:12:11] <arschmitz>         throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
[12:12:11] <arschmitz>               ^

[12:12:17] <arschmitz>     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:792:34)
[12:12:39] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think that's related to the events site.
[12:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> events.js is going to be node.
[12:13:25] <arschmitz> oh hmm
[12:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> That's not a very helpful error.
[12:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> Try throwing an uncaughtException handler in grunt.js and see if you can catch the real error.
[12:22:54] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: I made another attempt at the focusable implementation if you're still here :)
[12:25:10] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: I'll have a look.
[12:26:19] <gabriel_schulhof> ldeluca: Almost. You wanna store the result of this._ui.container.find( ":focusable" ).first() and assign it to this._ui.focusElement if its length is > 0.
[12:26:34] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do you have an idea in mind to best solve https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/341 ?
[12:26:40] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: ah, okay
[12:28:58] <agcolom> arschmitz: I have 2 PRs, if you get a chance: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/340 and https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/338
[12:30:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: that didnt catch anything anymore usefull
[12:32:03] <ldeluca> gabriel_schulhof: arschmitz I see a jshint error "too many var statements" what do you guys do with those? just ignore?
[12:32:17] <arschmitz> ldeluca: nope we fix them :-)
[12:32:28] <arschmitz> ldeluca: only one var statement per scope

[12:33:39] <arschmitz> so still only 1 var statement

[12:34:49] <arschmitz> ldeluca: http://contribute.jquery.org/ is the place for all your style related questions :)
[12:35:12] <ldeluca> arschmitz: thanks
[12:36:39] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so that did make the deploy finish fine though
[12:36:39] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Slightly more verbose: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/39089f59c756e8c3d50b683ff94f660b9ef41500
[12:36:42] <arschmitz> and it worked
[12:36:59] <ldeluca> arschmitz: fyi, the test code didn't alert me of the var style problem
[12:37:17] <ldeluca> arschmitz: meaning I incorrectly created multiple vars and it builds okay
[12:37:30] <ldeluca> arschmitz: not sure if there is an issue we file for the build?
[12:37:50] <arschmitz> ldeluca: builds will work
[12:37:57] <arschmitz> jshint is part of the tests
[12:38:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We could add the "lint" task to the build.
[12:38:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's not so bad.
[12:38:27] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and it's not flaky.
[12:39:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah thats probably fine
[12:41:37] <cgack> gabriel_schulhof: excellent thank you!
[12:42:03] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I have it on my list.

[12:42:16] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, thanks
[12:43:21] <ldeluca> arschmitz: when the issuer says an issue is "irrelevant now" https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7216  do you guys close or still leave it open as a low priority?
[13:02:21] <arschmitz> ldeluca: unless we are going to fix for 1.4.5 we can close ios5 will not be supported in 1.5
[13:03:34] <ldeluca> arschmitz: when does 1.4.5 release?  soon right?

[13:11:52] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so i got jqueryui.com to deploy
[13:12:07] <arschmitz> just catch that error and all is fine ha ha ha 
[13:14:28] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so looking at the wordpress-validate task it looks like the 3 things it does is terms posts, and xmlrpc version
[13:14:41] <arschmitz> the error is in the xmlrpc version one
[13:15:28] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i did rm -rf node_modules and that didnt help
[13:15:44] <arschmitz> iv also updated wordpress-wp-content to be sure 
[13:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> Weird. I haven't heard of anyone else having problems with that.
[13:17:39] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and i dont see the verifying xml-rpc message
[13:18:09] <arschmitz> so it must be in setting client = grunt.helper( "Wordpress-client" );
[13:20:30] <arschmitz> im doing verbose right now to see if i get any more detail
[13:21:54] <Omar-> hi jQM team
[13:22:21] <Omar-> will pagecontainerbeforechange fire once on 1.4.5 release?
[13:23:07] <Omar-> arschmitz nice presentation
[13:23:32] <arschmitz> Omar-: un likely
[13:23:46] <arschmitz> Omar-: 1.4.5 will only have a few small fixes for ios8
[13:24:19] <Omar-> so it's scheduled for 1.5 right?
[13:24:28] <arschmitz> yes
[13:25:10] <Omar-> good to know, thanks :)
[13:26:07] <Omar-> i have iphone 5 and ipad 2 iOS 8.0.2 if you want me to do some testing
[13:26:47] <Omar-> the new feature of dragging left/right edges wis conflicting with swipe
[13:26:53] <Omar-> with*
[13:27:01] <arschmitz> Omar-: they are different
[13:27:08] <arschmitz> Omar-: one has to start off the screen
[13:27:33] <Omar-> yup at the edge
[13:27:49] <Omar-> I haven't tested swipe events in a while
[13:28:22] <Omar-> once mobile and UI are merged, draggable widget will be available for mobile too right?
[13:28:43] <arschmitz> yes but thats a while away
[13:28:50] <arschmitz> because that requires pointer events
[13:29:24] <Omar-> I have to lookup pointer event. I saw it in your presentation but didn't understand it
[13:29:44] <arschmitz> its what windows phones use instead of touch events
[13:30:38] <Omar-> oh yea true
[13:30:58] <Omar-> I've once tried helping someone listening to touchevents on IE
[13:31:03] <arschmitz> they are vary similar but a much better standard much more friendly
[13:31:12] <Omar-> they have different events
[13:32:13] <Omar-> http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer-events
[13:32:14] <Omar-> nice
[13:32:29] <Omar-> supported by all except for Opera
[13:32:31] <arschmitz> Omar-: thats something completely different
[13:32:46] * Omar- palmface
[13:32:51] <Omar-> haha
[13:33:02] <Omar-> i'll look it up again
[13:33:26] <Omar-> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn433244(v=vs.85).aspx
[13:33:45] <arschmitz> only windows phone currently supports them https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerevents/raw-file/tip/pointerEvents.html
[13:34:11] <arschmitz> Omar-: firefox plans to implement
[13:34:22] <arschmitz> Omar-: chrome and safari have both said they will not
[13:35:33] <Omar-> weird, they all should support it
[13:35:46] <Omar-> ego has its' role here
[13:36:01] <arschmitz> Omar-: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=162757
[13:36:03] <arschmitz> star it
[13:36:37] <Omar-> done
[13:38:57] <Omar-> so pointer-events if implemented on all browsers, will replace mouse and touch events? or at least touch?
[13:40:45] <arschmitz> Omar-: it will replace mouse and touch
[13:40:57] <arschmitz> you will just use pointer events and it will work the same no matter what
[13:41:21] <Omar-> even on desktop? arschmitz
[13:41:26] <arschmitz> Omar-: yes
[13:41:28] <Omar-> nice
[13:41:36] <arschmitz> it will work for everything back to ie8 with a polyfill
[13:42:14] <Omar-> I look forward to it
[13:42:26] <Omar-> especially draggable in mobile
[13:43:40] <Omar-> jasperdegroot como estas? que tal la visa en Barcelona?
[13:43:45] <Omar-> vida*
[13:44:52] <Omar-> arschmitz btw, I liked the idea of multiple pagecontainer
[13:45:13] <Omar-> would that support mixing multi-page and single page models?
[13:45:44] <Omar-> without the need to turn ajax off when loading an external multi-page file into a multi-page file?
[13:46:11] <Omar-> or would it cause navigation history collusion?
[14:07:14] <arschmitz> Omar-: we may or may not support that but its unrelated to multiple page containers
[14:08:21] <Omar-> i thought it was related
[14:08:41] <Omar-> that its possible to load an external page into another pagecontainer
[14:08:43] <Omar-> just a thought
[14:29:58] <Omar-> arschmitz talk to you tomorrow
[14:30:26] <Omar-> ldeluca adios guappa ;)
