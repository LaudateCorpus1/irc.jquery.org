[01:21:20] <gnarf> Trying to write a test for http://jqbug.com/ui/p437 https://gist.github.com/bbdddde129c302eaf318 make sense? jzaefferer?
[02:15:37] <jzaefferer> hey gnarf
[02:16:30] <jzaefferer> that looks okay, though unit testing this stuff is more voodoo then science anyway - in the end, those simulated keypresses don't actually do what a native key event would
[02:21:09] <gnarf> right
[02:21:19] <gnarf> but they do execute the code that would override what the native event would
[02:21:29] <gnarf> btw, do you think that tab code should be keyup instead of keydown?
[02:42:58] <jzaefferer> dunno
[02:43:32] <jzaefferer> unlike mousedown/up, you can't cancel by moving the focus elsewhere...
[02:45:11] <gnarf> I think it makes more sense on keyup
[02:45:16] <gnarf> letting go of tab should move the focus
[02:45:18] <gnarf> not pressing it
[02:52:36] <jzaefferer> yeah, makes sense
[02:53:34] <jzaefferer> wanna reopen that ticket and do a PR with keyup and your test?
[03:06:33] <gnarf> I can just push it or do you want me to pull req it?
