[00:31:57] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI Release Coverage build #17: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20Release%20Coverage/17/
[00:31:57] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Menu: Remove ability to pass a function as the position option.
[00:31:58] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Menu: Alphabetize options.
[00:31:58] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Menu tests: More complete role option tests.
[00:31:59] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Menu tests: Proper detection for absence of ui-state-disabled class.
[00:31:59] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Menu tests: Added TODOs for missing method tests.
[02:10:39] <jzaefferer> One coverage job runs about 436.000 assertions
[02:11:14] <jzaefferer> one effects failure against jquery-git in IE9: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/49884 dying with "window.onerror: Invalid argument."
[05:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, I can't reproduce it.
[05:21:26] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to 1-8-stable: http://git.io/Y0GX_A
[05:21:26] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Core: Adjust data pseudo creation to use new Sizzle pseudo creation for pseudos with arguments. - Timmy Willison
[05:23:05] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: "invalid argument" isn't a useful error message.. I can later look into reproducing this with testswarm and browserstack's tunnel locally
[05:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:24:37] <jzaefferer> releasing QUnit 1.9.0 right now, featuring labels and tooltips for custom checkboxes :-)
[05:26:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez / danheberden - did we get anywhere with gith ?
[05:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't. I got discouraged when I realized I'd need to work on a real server and do a bunch of pushes just to get useful test data.
[05:28:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thats a shame - its one of the last pieces of this puzzle
[05:32:23] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: so we'll need to coordinate these releases of core and ui ... when were you planning to release?
[05:32:23] <bot-t> (8 hours 38 mins ago) <mikesherov_> Tell DaveMethvin I figured out the IE8 test fail. Font-size CSS declaration on body in bootstrap.min.css
[05:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We have lots of infrastructure to do: API site, download builder, TR testing, new site....
[05:33:42] <scott_gonzalez> Hoping to get some details about the progress in various areas in today's meeting.
[05:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> We HAVE to release close to the end of the month though if we want to hit our target for 1.10.
[05:34:22] <DaveMethvin> we can bring back a few things to improve backcompat like curCSS, dunno if that would fix enough to let us release without a UI update
[05:34:23] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: is Richard around these days? I have time open in the evenings this week to work on sites, but need some direction.
[05:34:54] <DaveMethvin> richard is on vacation all week kswedberg
[05:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: That alone won't fix it.
[05:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> But we can release 1.8.22 without any infrastructure updates.
[05:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> 1-8-stable already has a curCSS fix.
[05:36:00] <DaveMethvin> great, that would work for us
[05:36:14] <scott_gonzalez> Well, at least it's supposed to. I'm currently tracking down a bug in UI position.
[05:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> We're getting NaNs :-/
[05:36:27] <DaveMethvin> on kswedberg's itch to get something done, perhaps jquery.com home page scott_gonzalez?
[05:36:34] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: bummer. well, maybe I can chat with scott_gonzalez or someone about status and where to head next
[05:37:15] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: that's a good idea.When is today's mtg? My calendar isn't showing jQuery meetings anymore for some reason.
[05:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be a bit upset if he doesn't make it to today's meeting.
[05:37:31] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: who?
[05:37:33] <scott_gonzalez> noon ET
[05:37:35] <scott_gonzalez> Richard
[05:37:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez is there a bug for that NaN position issue?
[05:37:55] <kswedberg> ah. hmm. I can make it for the first 20min or so.
[05:38:10] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Nope. It's only against jquery-git.
[05:38:17] <jzaefferer> I've started prototyping download builder on the plane
[05:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ok
[05:38:45] <jzaefferer> once I've got QUnit 1.9 in UI and updated the urlConfig, I'll continue on that
[05:39:01] <scott_gonzalez> new URL config?
[05:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> I need to get QUnit commits into my feed reader...
[05:39:16] <jzaefferer> as long as I don't fall asleep...
[05:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We need to discuss budget as well.
[05:39:55] <scott_gonzalez> That can wait till tomorrow if you're tired.
[05:42:49] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: http://bassistance.de/i/440817.png
[05:42:51] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Getting closer....Our outerWidth() proxy is broken with 1.8.
[05:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nice
[05:46:16] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/17ckag
[05:46:16] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Update to QUnit 1.9.0 and use new urlConfig for custom checkboxes - Jörn Zaefferer
[05:46:21] <jzaefferer> there
[05:48:33] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Fixed!
[05:48:34] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 2 new commits to 1-8-stable: http://git.io/PrXdYw
[05:48:34] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Datepicker: Remove styles specifically for IE5. - Scott González
[05:48:34] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Core: Check if jQuery supports inner/outer/Width/Height setters. - Scott González
[05:49:00] <jzaefferer> looks like there are effects regressions now: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/229
[05:49:07] <jzaefferer> wrong channel
[06:15:00] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #579: SUCCESS in 10 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/579/
[06:15:01] <jq-jenkins> joern.zaefferer: Update to QUnit 1.9.0 and use new urlConfig for custom checkboxes
[06:39:09] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Just to confirm, you'll still be awake for the meeting today, right?
[08:50:44] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I edited descriptions in the json files. wanna take a look? https://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-ui/tree/manifest/build
[08:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: looking...
[08:52:13] <kswedberg> k
[08:53:30] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good. I'll merge those in. Thanks.
[08:53:44] <kswedberg> sure. want me to send a pull request?
[08:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> Nah, I got it.
[08:54:59] <kswedberg> k thx
[08:55:12] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to manifest: http://git.io/dE_aTQ
[08:55:12] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/manifest] Update descriptions of UI components in manifest files. - Karl Swedberg
[08:57:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez fyi, i'll be at the meeting but late. in another meeting right now that is going over
[08:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:59:05] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: you awake?
[08:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> bot-t: Go to jzaefferer's house and wake him up from his nap.
[08:59:43] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Couldn't find "Go to jzaefferer's house and wake him up from his nap." in jQuery Docs.
[09:00:02] * scott_gonzalez rolls eyes
[09:01:41] <jzaefferer> I'm awake
[09:01:57] <jzaefferer> will join soonish
[11:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: So you think we should use shelljs and just require whoever's doing the release to install it globally?
[11:01:05] <jzaefferer> seems fine to me
[11:01:12] <jzaefferer> would certainly make the bash conversion quite easy
[11:02:40] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:07:42] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: you're still going to create those 4 api issues, right? kswedberg is looking for input, I think
[11:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, just wrapping up some other stuff.
[11:08:23] <jzaefferer> okay
[12:28:01] <ajpiano> loool jzaefferer i was on my way to your grunt-jquery-content repo to open an issue about using cheerio instead of JSDOM
[12:28:14] <ajpiano> when i saw that you left the same comment on richard's node-pygmentize 8 hours ago
[12:28:15] <ajpiano> :p
[12:51:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Got a minute for a call?
[13:06:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yup
[13:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, now I'm on another call.
[13:06:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ping you when this call ends.
[13:07:03] <gnarf> just call - worst case I call you back and we can play tag there ;)
[14:42:35] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I made a change in web-base-template/master that I want to deploy for qunitjs.com - which currently runs against the legacy branch
[14:42:43] <jzaefferer> can I just cherry-pick my commit?
[14:42:54] <jzaefferer> I really have no idea how that legacy branch is used
[14:43:00] <jzaefferer> or why its there in the first place
[14:48:57] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yes - cherry-pick away
[14:49:19] <gnarf> the legacy branch is putting the "old skin" on jquery.com right now
[14:49:33] <gnarf> and is one checkout away from being the new site
[14:51:54] <jzaefferer> okay
[14:52:00] <jzaefferer> looks good on staging: http://stage.qunitjs.com/
[14:52:21] <jzaefferer> well, that is running master anyway
[14:52:26] <jzaefferer> that's stupid
[14:52:38] <jzaefferer> what good is a staging server if it doesn't mirror live?
[14:53:15] <jzaefferer> well, no more 404s here in the header: http://qunitjs.com/
[14:53:29] <jzaefferer> and 1.9.0 links in the footer
[15:08:20] <gnarf> jzaefferer: checkout legacy and see :)
[15:08:49] <gnarf> jzaefferer: the last person working on stage was using master
[15:09:03] <jzaefferer> gnarf: okay, guess that makes sense
[15:09:05] <jzaefferer> nevermind then :-)
[15:09:18] <gnarf> put it back when you're done
[15:09:19] <gnarf> ;)
[15:10:19] <jzaefferer> I've already pushed my changes live, so whatever :p
[15:10:28] <jzaefferer> next time I'll check staging first
[15:11:35] <gnarf> jzaefferer: sorry that "legacy" is in the way
[15:11:40] <gnarf> i can't wait to delete that branch
[15:11:59] <jzaefferer> its not thaat bad
[15:12:04] <gnarf> but its a necessary part of our evil empire approach
[15:12:32] <jzaefferer> I don't know why it took us so long to realize that its a stupid idea to even try to launch 20 new sites as one
[15:12:47] <jzaefferer> looks like learn could be next: https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/121#issuecomment-6921268
[15:12:47] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #121 on learn.jquery.com (jzaefferer; 11m, 41s ago): Release
[15:13:35] <jzaefferer> laterz
[15:50:12] <ajpiano> lol i had no idea "legacy" existed until jzaefferer just mentioned it in his comment
[15:56:24] <gnarf> :)
[15:57:18] <gnarf> most of the stuff should be able to merge/cherry-pick/rebase to legacy - the "legacy" branch is just master + some themes we will throw away to support hosting the old sites on the new server
[23:06:42] <jzaefferer> ?tell kswedberg this should come in handy when working on any of the sites and doing a lot of deployments: https://github.com/jzaefferer/grunt-jquery-content/issues/3#issuecomment-6924976 /cc ajpiano
[23:06:43] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[23:06:43] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3 on grunt-jquery-content (jzaefferer; 19h, 44m ago): Option to disable code highlighting
