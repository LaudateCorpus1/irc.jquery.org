[20:35:44] <kborchers> gnarf: just wondering if you know how to deploy the blog locally. trying to work on https://github.com/jquery/blog.jqueryui.com-theme/issues/1 but have no idea how to test changes :/
[21:31:14] <gnarf> kborchers: so, we've been using stage.blog.jqueryui.com to test that stuff i think
[21:31:34] <gnarf> kborchers: which you'd need SSH to get onto
[21:31:40] <gnarf> kborchers: I'll set you up tomorrow?
[21:32:17] <kborchers> gnarf: sounds good, thanks. would be nice to be able to do it locally but i guess it is what it is for now
[22:19:45] <gnarf> kborchers: you could copy the directory off the server and dump its db and do it locally
[22:19:56] <gnarf> tomorrow... :)
[23:03:30] <mikesherov> 580 tixx!
