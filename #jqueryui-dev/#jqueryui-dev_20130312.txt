[05:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Speaking of pointer events, how's the special events implementation coming along?
[05:18:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that's what i was crying about last night â€¦ it is "working" for mouse and touch (haven't integrated MSPointer yet) but for some reason on touch there is a delay between start and move so i have to hold the draggable until that annoying iOS selection box pops up, then it moves just fine.
[05:18:24] <kborchers> if i move before that box pops, the draggable doesn't move with my finger but then pops to the place where i stop
[05:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> You don't have that problem in the interactions branch, right?
[05:18:54] <kborchers> nope
[05:20:12] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers DaveMethvin|away: What are you doing at 1:00p ET?
[05:20:38] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a call with MS Open Tech about Pointer Events in jQuery.
[05:21:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i have a call at 1:30 ET
[05:21:59] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> Can you put your code somewhere?
[05:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: You're ok with pushing the disabled change to 1.11.0, right?
[05:22:55] <mikesherov> yes
[05:23:00] <mikesherov> that's why I merged it :-)
[05:23:16] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: sure i'll push to a branch on my fork â€¦ just don't laugh too much as it could be all wrong since i've actually never played with special events :)
[05:23:16] <mikesherov> oh, I see
[05:23:19] <scott_gonzalez> Right now master is 1.10.2.
[05:23:21] <mikesherov> meaning, not for 1.10.2
[05:23:42] <mikesherov> Yeah, if you want to push it, let's push it back.
[05:23:47] <mikesherov> Cut the release right before it
[05:24:12] <jzaefferer> still need to update at least authors before tagging
[05:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> And we want the grunt changes in 1.10.2, right?
[05:25:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just revert, do the release this afternoon, then revert the revert.
[05:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can branch and cherry-pick the grunt changes.
[05:28:05] <kborchers> lol â€¦ don't think i've seen this one before http://cl.ly/image/2Z04121H2a2K
[05:31:36] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: went with a gist instead since i am developing the pointer stuff in a separate repo (wasn't sure where to put it) https://gist.github.com/kborchers/d8640f4c36d897b75f2a
[05:32:27] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: interested in your thoughts so i know if i'm way off or on the right track
[05:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll check it out before my call.
[05:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> Have you looked at the Pointer Events spec?
[05:35:07] <kborchers> no i was just starting with creating a special event that merged what we already had, then i was going to go through and clean it up
[05:35:42] <kborchers> i mean i've looked at it but that's about it
[05:36:20] <kborchers> that's where i pulled event names from, etc.
[05:38:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ok
[05:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> I was noticing things like `identifier = "mouse"`
[05:39:08] <scott_gonzalez> And the architecture will need to change.
[05:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> Which you've noticed: https://gist.github.com/kborchers/d8640f4c36d897b75f2a#file-pointer-js-L10

[06:16:43] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, hello. What's `sizer` used for?
[06:16:50] <rxaviers> (jqueryUI grunt task)
[06:17:24] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: that tells you how big files are after minification and gzip, to compare one branch or change against another
[06:19:23] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what's the plan for 1.10.2? Revert the widget-disabled commit, update authors, release that?
[06:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> Probably, I'll wait till I'm ready to do the release though.
[06:19:56] <scott_gonzalez> Which should be this afternoon.
[06:20:06] <jzaefferer> okay

[11:37:09] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ah yeap, aff. My internet connection just hang while I was publishing
[11:37:13] <rxaviers> Im reading how to fix that
[11:37:35] <scott_gonzalez> Try npm publish -f
[11:37:46] <scott_gonzalez> But before that, maybe copy the log info somewhere, if it's useful at all.
[11:38:12] <rxaviers> just saw there's a unpublish too
[11:38:14] <rxaviers> will try
[11:38:23] <rxaviers> ok

[11:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to install for the release dry run.

[11:56:22] <doesallmagic> * Scott GonzÃ¡lez: Updated AUTHORS.txt.
[11:58:05] <scott_gonzalez> oy, I need to install old IM.
[11:58:25] <scott_gonzalez> ImageMagick 6.8.0-7 was working for me locally.
[11:59:51] <rxaviers> really? Im checking the version against 6.6 otherwise it aborts
[12:00:07] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Should I install 6.6.9-10?
[12:00:11] <rxaviers> you can skip that on lib/themeroller.image.js, line 309
[12:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I can't have modifications and use the release script.
[12:00:30] <rxaviers> or install it
[12:01:16] <rxaviers> stage has IM 6.6..
[12:01:25] <rxaviers> perhaps we can use that machine for this too :P
[12:02:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try a dry run on stage and see what happens.
[12:03:46] <rxaviers> ok.. stage is using download builder HEAD and seems fine so far.
[12:07:32] <rxaviers> (although, that's another topic, Im referring to live stage)
[12:07:49] <rxaviers> http://stage.jqueryui.com/
[12:08:00] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...I'll probably need to setup my git credentials on this server.
[12:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> Surprisingly, this is much slower on stage than on my laptop.
[12:11:34] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, no zip executable on stage.
[12:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, time to install IM 6.6
[12:11:52] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, do you wanna "revert" that approach and try to install IM 6.6?
[12:11:55] <rxaviers> af
[12:12:00] <rxaviers> :)
[12:12:15] <rxaviers> are you able to simply install it or need to compile.
[12:14:18] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure. I assume I can install an old version from port?
[12:16:15] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't look like it :-(
[12:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> I might need to compile.
[12:18:29] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/5146030 :-(
[12:20:11] <rxaviers> checking
[12:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> So, how crazy would it be to have the release script actually go out to the staging server for the themes?
[12:23:34] <rxaviers> found this http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?t=20267
[12:23:36] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I guess that was ghetto because we had to push jquery-ui master to staging before.
[12:24:52] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's not too helpful. We can't upgrade to 6.7 because that broke on the servers, right?
[12:25:03] <rxaviers> are we able to use another zlib?
[12:25:15] <rxaviers> that's smells like pain ahead
[12:25:27] <rxaviers> we never know how much is to come
[12:25:37] <rxaviers> hey
[12:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, oh, I know.
[12:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> Let's stop generating themes :-P
[12:25:56] <rxaviers> is it on master?
[12:26:08] <scott_gonzalez> Is what on master?
[12:26:16] <rxaviers> I mean, do you want to generate themes with jquery-ui master HEAD?
[12:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[12:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it has the version number replaced already.
[12:27:09] <rxaviers> is this something I could do and send you the pkg?
[12:29:04] <rxaviers> I guess you are trying to run `grunt release_themes`. Is that correct?
[12:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but indirectly.
[12:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/release/release.js#L138
[12:30:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just running that whole script.
[12:30:15] <scott_gonzalez> Which eventually runs `grunt release_cdn`
[12:30:20] <scott_gonzalez> Which runs the generate_themes task.
[12:30:45] <scott_gonzalez> So it's running against code that isn't even committed yet.
[12:31:15] <rxaviers> ok, I see
[12:31:42] <rxaviers> if compiling IM 6.6 is getting more problematic than running it from stage, and you'd like to go back to that approach
[12:31:52] <rxaviers> I've installed zip on stage jq02
[12:33:55] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll try on stage again.
[12:36:17] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Well, I can't set my git info anyway.
[12:36:34] <rxaviers> do you need to push anything?
[12:37:44] <rxaviers> (I am wondering if read-only access works)
[12:37:56] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...well, let me try doing a global config for my user.
[12:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that worked. I forgot that it was going to default to the current repo (which doesn't exist right now).
[12:39:42] <scott_gonzalez> So that should get commits to work.
[12:39:53] <scott_gonzalez> Then pushing to GitHub should probably just prompt me in the middle of the script.
[12:39:56] <scott_gonzalez> We'll see if this works...
[12:40:02] <rxaviers> cool :)
[12:40:12] <rxaviers> in the meanwhile, Im filing IM a bug.
[12:40:23] <rxaviers> They use a forum as bug tracker, oh mine
[12:40:43] <scott_gonzalez> wow
[12:49:10] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: What's the easiest way for me to copy a directory from stage to my laptop?
[12:49:35] <rxaviers> 1sec cell
[12:49:37] <rxaviers> plz
[12:51:15] <rxaviers> done
[12:51:21] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, scp or rsync
[12:52:07] <rxaviers> when scp'ing, I first `tar -czf package.tgz path` on server, then `scp user@server:path-to-package.tgz .` on local machine
[12:52:38] <rxaviers> or you can `rsync -av user@server:path .` <- needs to test
[12:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> perfect, thanks
[12:53:46] <rxaviers> ;)
[12:54:27] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Remind me why we decided not to use GraphicsMagick.
[12:55:20] <scott_gonzalez> Also, how do I unzip this now?
[12:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> tar xvzf or something like that?
[12:58:06] <rxaviers> corect
[12:58:16] <rxaviers> tar -xzf package.tgz
[12:58:28] <rxaviers> (v to add verbose)
[13:00:16] <rxaviers> I found no way to generate our icons and textures using GraphicsMagick 
[13:02:10] <rxaviers> GM is a fork of IM, and does not follow its api reliably  AFAIK
[13:07:31] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...ok
[13:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like the image generation worked properly.
[13:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> And the commits have my info.
[13:09:22] <scott_gonzalez> The CDN folder still has the base theme.
[13:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe something needs to change in the release script itself.
[13:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually not sure where this is coming from.
[13:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer?
[13:16:26] <rxaviers> really?
[13:16:41] <rxaviers> when I tested it, I had a previous folder with base
[13:16:48] <rxaviers> I delete it and run generate_themes
[13:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-ui-themes-1.10.2 doesn't have base.
[13:18:12] <scott_gonzalez> But jquery-ui-1.10.2-cdn does.
[13:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> It's something in jquery-ui's gruntfile.
[13:18:27] <rxaviers> got it
[13:18:29] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm not sure what.
[13:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> If everything else looks ok, I'm just going to do the release.
[13:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> We can go one more version with the stupid base theme on CDNs :-P
[13:19:31] <rxaviers> hehe
[14:34:40] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, if perhaps you need to tag DB and Im not here, master is stable. So, it's pretty straightforward.
[16:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I think I'm going to wait and do it first thing in the morning.
[16:54:15] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez what's the best way to comment on hand.js? It's got a lot of things that we wouldn't be able to do
[16:54:59] <DaveMethvin> i'd really like to have a gist with comments under the lines
[17:24:36] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Well, you can't comment on a lines in a gist.
[17:24:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah i know
[17:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> So maybe just create a repo for discussion?
[17:25:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah i could do that
[17:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> How does codeplex work?
[17:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a link to the source repo somewhere?
[17:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> The source code tab just seems to be a viewer.
[17:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be best if we could just do a mirror.
[17:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> Well, actually, maybe not.
[17:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> A mirror would make comments hard too.
[17:28:22] <DaveMethvin> i'll just add block comments in my gist
[18:02:53] <rxaviers> Ok, see ya tomorrow then

[19:45:25] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/067415-sortable-revert 143d051e5 15Scott GonzÃ¡lez: Sortable: Only animate along the specified axis when reverting. Fixes #7415 - Sortable: Incorrect revert animation with axis: 'y'.
[19:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> Is that a cantfix for core?
[19:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't dig too deep, but I assume the problem is `left: "auto"`
