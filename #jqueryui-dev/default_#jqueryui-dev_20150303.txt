[04:10:33] <synobium> hi
[04:10:40] <arschmitz> synobium: Hi
[04:11:32] <synobium> i want to work for ur organisatin in gsoc
[04:12:38] <arschmitz> synobium: ok which project / task were you interested in
[04:14:26] <synobium> better diff output
[04:15:20] <synobium> new demo system
[04:16:44] <synobium> run time code for production
[04:16:56] <arschmitz> synobium: jzaefferer and leobalter are the qunit mentors so they will be able to provide better help there then i can but here is some background info and issues for that one https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/335 https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/364 https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/363
[04:17:27] <arschmitz> for demo system its jzaefferer and I but this task cant be worked on yet its waiting on other things
[04:18:22] <synobium> ok so how can be upto date with projects
[04:18:41] <arschmitz> for globalize you want to talk to rxaviers_ you can find some background info in the logs for #globalize http://irc.jquery.org/%23globalize/default_%23globalize_20150302.log.html for more infor there
[04:19:11] <arschmitz> synobium: the best way to keep up to date with projects is attend the weekly meetings and follow the repos http://meetings.jquery.org/
[04:20:19] <synobium> i am also interested in styling componets for js library too u are a in mentor in that too right
[04:20:29] <arschmitz> yup
[04:21:25] <synobium> ty for ur help
[04:21:27] <arschmitz> sfrisk: and i are for that one #css-chassis is the right channel for that project this is part of that https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/6
[04:21:27] <b-ot> arschmitz: You have 1 new message (and 1 unread), use `read when you wish to read it.
[04:23:50] <synobium> what else could i do till student registration to increase my chances for getting selected for these projects
[04:26:49] <arschmitz> synobium: if your just looking for ways to get involved
[04:27:02] <arschmitz> synobium: look at the issue trackers for the projects
[04:27:09] <arschmitz> those are the best place to get involved
[04:27:21] <arschmitz> triage issues work on bug fixes etc
[04:34:37] <synobium> ok ty 
[04:36:31] <synobium> i can work on the code in github right...
[04:37:42] <arschmitz> while you can edit the code directly in github you wont be able to run tests etc
[04:37:53] <arschmitz> so you really need to clone the repository and work locally 
[04:38:56] <synobium> hmm
[04:42:25] <synobium> is it compulsory to participate in meeting cuz i might have exms in in those days
[04:42:33] <arschmitz> no
[04:42:37] <arschmitz> just encouraged
[04:44:19] <synobium> but i have read the rules and tose say if u don't debug or participate in meetings then organization might not consider u for thr project
[05:04:24] <Tanay> jzaefferer: ping
[05:13:45] <jzaefferer> Tanay: pong
[05:14:40] <Tanay> jzaefferer: I wanted to discuss about the ideas page of JQuery in GSoC
[05:15:05] <jzaefferer> Tanay: I just made a few notes to get started: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students
[05:15:24] <jzaefferer> Tanay: otherwise, what specifically did you want to discuss?
[05:15:38] <Tanay> Can I come on PM?
[05:16:48] <Tanay> jzaefferer: Wanted to discuss the JQuery UI demo project
[05:25:17] <jzaefferer> no need for PMs
[05:26:42] <jzaefferer> Tanay: have you read everything on https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/96 ?
[05:27:05] <Tanay> jzaefferer: Yes :)

[05:30:08] <jzaefferer> Tanay: what specifically would you like to discuss?
[05:30:16] <Tanay> jzaefferer: So, the idea would be new Demos/real-world examples as well as jsbin.com integration to the examples so that they can be edited online 
[05:30:55] <jzaefferer> Tanay: yeah, that's the gist of it. Should start with one of those tasks
[05:31:22] <arschmitz> Tanay: note though the jsbin part cant actually be worked on yet 
[05:31:45] <Tanay> arschmitz: Why so?
[05:31:50] <arschmitz> there are some things that need to be done first on our side that we are working on
[05:32:18] <arschmitz> account setups and other purely procedural stuff but we cant do anything until this is all setup
[05:32:18] <Tanay> arschmitz: Cool!
[05:32:30] <Tanay> arschmitz: True that
[05:32:36] <Tanay> jzaefferer: I was wondering if we could discuss the sample templates of the real world demos.
[05:33:23] <jzaefferer> Tanay: sure
[05:34:56] <Tanay> jzaefferer: Those would be like some applications as mentioned on #96. Would they be separate applications or a single application using different widgets in different parts of the apllication ? 
[05:37:58] <jzaefferer> Tanay: both sounds like a valid approach. In general, keeping it simple helps. A real-world demo doesn't have to involve a lot of widgets
[05:38:28] <jzaefferer> Tanay: for example, this Kendo UI demo shows just their autocomplete widget, but it provides some context to make it "real": http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/autocomplete/index
[05:41:09] <Tanay> jzaefferer: True, thanks I will work on it
[05:42:40] <jzaefferer> Tanay: great, let me know if you have more questions
[05:45:11] <Tanay> jzaefferer: I was wondering if you could kindly review my proposal and could let me know how I can improve it?

[06:03:40] <jzaefferer> Tanay: that looks good. I think it needs some more detail on the deliverable, like an example of such a real-world demo. What what that demo involve?
[06:04:10] <jzaefferer> Tanay: once that is there, this would be good to discuss with the jQuery UI team
[06:04:46] <Tanay> jzaefferer: Sure, will do that today itself and get back :)
[06:21:39] <Anish___> Hey ! I would like to contribute to the jQuery UI - new demo system 
[06:21:46] <Anish___> can anyone get me started ?
[06:24:23] <jzaefferer> Anish___: have you read this? https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students
[06:27:56] <Anish___> Thanks jzaefferer  
[06:32:32] <Anish___> I have forked the jquery-ui
[06:33:47] <Tanay> jzaefferer: Updated the proposal, including some demo examples: https://gist.github.com/tanay1337/484daa8bb8410bcb607a
[06:34:16] <Tanay> jzaefferer: Kindly do let me know what you think, and how I can further improve :)
[06:42:56] <jzaefferer> Tanay: that looks good. To go through the process of contributing something asasp, it might be good if you could pick something small to implement, send a PR etc. pp.
[06:43:11] <jzaefferer> Tanay: could be an update to an existing demo...
[06:44:27] <Tanay> jzaefferer: Sure, will do that today itself, thank you very much :)
[06:44:42] <Tanay> jzaefferer: I will stay in touch

[09:37:52] <sambuddhabasu1> i want to participate for GSoC
[09:37:56] <sambuddhabasu1> where do I get started?
[09:39:28] <M4rius> I would guess https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List is a good starting place
[09:41:55] <arschmitz> sambuddhabasu1: yes ^^
[09:41:59] <arschmitz> M4rius: thank you
[09:42:56] <sambuddhabasu1> wow i see many projects :D
[09:44:42] <sambuddhabasu1> to begin with, the 'new demo system' project looks interesting!
[09:45:46] <sambuddhabasu1> M4rius: im guessing the QUnit is used for unit testing?
[09:46:36] <arschmitz> sambuddhabasu1: QUnit is a unit testing framework
[10:02:43] <gauravmittal> leobalter:  ping
[10:02:52] <leobalter> hey
[10:03:59] <gauravmittal> leobalter: I would like to work on the new diff project
[10:04:23] <gauravmittal> How do i start it?
[10:10:11] <gauravmittal> leobalter: How should i proceed towards this project??
[10:12:26] <leobalter> We want to land a better diff on QUnit, we have suggestions on the related issues but we didn't go far enough with something working.
[10:14:01] <leobalter> IMHO, the current best diff example is the Github diff, e.g.: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/756/files?diff=split
[10:15:18] <gauravmittal> Are the suggestions the ones mentioned on https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/364 ??
[10:20:49] <gauravmittal> leobalter: ^ I agree, The github one looks the best. 
[10:23:44] <gauravmittal> leobalter: The trac project also has a good diff also according to me (eg: http://trac.edgewall.org/attachment/ticket/199/diff_module_alpha1.diff). But yes, I think that github diff looks better than that 
[10:27:03] <gauravmittal> leobalter: So, how should i begin working on it?
[10:27:44] <Tanay> arschmitz: ping
[10:27:54] <arschmitz> Tanay: Hi
[10:48:21] <leobalter> gauravmittal: I need to review the diff issue to have a consistent answer. So far, the goal is to ship a better diff
[10:48:31] <leobalter> I'll do it today
[10:49:39] <gauravmittal> leobalter: ok ... thanks :) ... in the meantime are there any small tasks that i can do to familiarize myself with the source code?
[11:22:53] <gauravmittal> arschmitz: hey
[11:23:20] <arschmitz> gauravmittal: hi
[11:23:58] <gauravmittal> arschmitz: do u know of any small tasks in qunit that i could maybe work on so as to familiarize myself with the source code?

[12:52:22] <jzaefferer> gauravmittal: there are several issues labelled "diff", some of them should be rather small
[12:52:46] <gauravmittal> jzaefferer: thanks ... will look at those
[13:02:54] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, finally done ^
[13:02:57] <rxaviers> :)
[13:03:18] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:29:58] <gauravmittal> jzaefferer: hey, for https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/706, the objective is to display the source of all the tests right? 
[13:31:58] <gauravmittal> leobalter: ^
[14:15:41] <leobalter> gauravmittal: if you fail a test, QUnit send the source location of the error, the idea there is to also catch the source location of the assertion.
[14:17:05] <leobalter> actually, the issue says tests but I think the assert location is more appropriate.
[14:17:13] <gauravmittal> leobalter: u mean we also have to display the source of the assertion statement
[14:17:26] <gauravmittal> ?
[14:18:28] <leobalter> force a test error, you gonna see QUnit will expose some lines saying where in the files the error happened. 
[14:18:32] <leobalter> like: "
[14:18:53] <leobalter> "@ src/file.js: 12"
[14:19:22] <leobalter> saying the error happened at line 12 on file src/file.js
[14:21:46] <gauravmittal> leobalter: yes .... but according to the issue, it seems that the source needs to be shown for the passed tests as well. Am i right?
[14:24:48] <leobalter> s/tests/assertions (I just included a comment on the issue to confirm that).
[14:25:41] <leobalter> also, you can get it working from the same methods used to show the lines from failing tests
[14:26:53] <gauravmittal> leobalter: yes, i made a commit for it here https://github.com/gauravmittal1995/qunit/commit/b65cba9150834f3930e3185138ab431113a9522d . Is it ok?
[14:28:23] <leobalter> would you set up a Pull Request for that? This way I can review and test it
[14:29:46] <gauravmittal> ok
[14:30:36] <gauravmittal> leobalter: done
[14:31:48] <leobalter> Thanks, I'll take a better look tomorrow, but the PRs are always the way to check new commits. 
[14:36:42] <gauravmittal> ok
[14:38:22] <gauravmittal> leobalter: The tests seem to be failing. Since the logs will display the source for the passed tests as well, it seems that the test/logs.js needs to be updated to include the source. Any idea how i can do that?

[20:20:16] <arschmitz> Tanay: i read it over quickly earlier
[20:20:37] <Tanay> arschmitz: Okay, any way I can improve?
[20:20:52] <arschmitz> Tanay: it looked pretty good there was nothing that stood out
[20:21:30] <Tanay> arschmitz: Thanks :) I have started to get familiar with the code base
