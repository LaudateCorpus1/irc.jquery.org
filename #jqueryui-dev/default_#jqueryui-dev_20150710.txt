[00:06:05] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #733: UNSTABLE in 9 min 5 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/733/
[00:08:08] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I see the problem now ... the class name has been changed from ui-icon-display-block to ui-widget-icon-block but we didn't change it in the CSS
[00:08:27] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: will take care of that
[00:08:58] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: thanks for the other fix, will pull and rebase
[00:23:03] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I think we need to revert commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/91ac2c2375124fa496bea5298343fbd0b5d7b5b2
[00:23:35] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: we should only remove selectors with ui-hide-label in it from the rule, not remove the complete rule if it's also used for other things
[00:24:04] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ui-hidden-accessible isn't deprecated for example
[05:10:54] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:13:35] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: Pong!
[05:13:57] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Hey! The dialog option of the page widget is an ... option. So, should it be settable at runtime?
[05:14:17] <gabrielschulhof> Like turn a page into a dialog and back into a page and so forth?
[05:14:54] <gabrielschulhof> ... just looking to get some almost-ready PRs off my back, when I realized this.
[05:15:21] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: hmm 
[05:15:53] <arschmitz> Im strongly inclined to not make that possible
[05:16:20] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah ... not sure how useful that would be ...
[05:17:35] <gabrielschulhof> OK ... that's good enough for me. Continuing to treat it as a flag rather than an option.
[05:20:24] <arschmitz> We should mark that in the api

[05:25:40] <gabrielschulhof> D'oh ... the component is "Page", not "Dialog" :/

[07:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> Is this working for anyone right now? git ls-remote --tags --heads git://github.com/JamesMGreene/qunit-assert-close.git
[07:46:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting timeouts, but GitHub says everything should be working now.
[08:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, I've got datepicker tests passing in the merge.
[08:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> Now I need to get calendar tests passing.
[08:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> Then walk through all the demos.
[08:59:48] <arschmitz> Nice!
